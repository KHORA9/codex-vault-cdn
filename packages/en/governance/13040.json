X\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Jonathan Swift on the bust by Rouldiac in Trinity\r\nCollege Dublin]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROSE WORKS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SWIFT, D.D.\r\n\r\nEDITED BY\r\n\r\nTEMPLE SCOTT\r\n\r\nVOL. X\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL WRITINGS\r\n\r\n1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nOf late years, that is to say, within the last thirty odd years, there\r\nhas existed a certain amount of doubt as to whether or no the work known\r\nto us as \"The History of the Four Last Years of the Queen,\" was really\r\nthe product of Swift's pen. That a work of this nature had occupied\r\nSwift during his retirement at Windsor in 1713, is undoubted. That the\r\nwork here reprinted from the edition given to the world in 1758, \"by an\r\nanonymous editor from a copy surreptitiously taken by an anonymous\r\nfriend\" (to use Mr. Churton Collins's summary), is the actual work upon\r\nwhich Swift was engaged at Windsor, is not so certain. Let us for a\r\nmoment trace the history of what is known of what Swift did write, and\r\nthen we shall be in a better position to judge of the authenticity of\r\nwhat we have before us.\r\n\r\nAll that we know of this work is gathered from Swift's correspondence,\r\nas published by Sir Walter Scott in his edition of Swift's Works issued\r\nin 1824. The first reference there made is in a note from Dr. William\r\nKing to Mrs. Whiteway, from which we gather that Swift, towards the end\r\nof the year 1736, was meditating the publication of what he had written\r\nin 1713. \"As to the History,\" writes King, \"the Dean may be assured I\r\nwill take care to supply the dates that are wanting, and which can\r\neasily be done in an hour or two. The tracts, if he pleases, may be\r\nprinted by way of appendix. This will be indeed less trouble than the\r\ninterweaving them in the body of the history, and will do the author as\r\nmuch honour, and answer the purpose full as well.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written from Paris, under date November 9th, O.S., 1736. It can\r\neasily be gathered from this that the tracts referred to are the tracts\r\non the same period which Swift wrote at the time in defence of the\r\nOxford ministry. They are given in the fifth volume of this edition.\r\n\r\nOn December 7th, 1736, King was in London, and he immediately writes to\r\nSwift himself on the matter of the History. \"I arrived here yesterday,\"\r\nhe says, \"and I am now ready to obey your commands. I hope you are come\r\nto a positive resolution concerning the History. You need not hesitate\r\nabout the dates, or the references which are to be made to any public\r\npapers; for I can supply them without the least trouble. As well as I\r\nremember, there is but one of those public pieces which you determined\r\nshould be inserted at length; I mean Sir Thomas Hanmer's Representation;\r\nthis I have now by me. If you incline to publish the two tracts as an\r\nAppendix to the History, you will be pleased to see if the character\r\ngiven of the Earl of Oxford in the pamphlet of 1715 agrees with the\r\ncharacter given of the same person in the History.[1] Perhaps on a\r\nreview you may think proper to leave one of them quite out. You have (I\r\nthink) barely mentioned the attempt of Guiscard, and the quarrel between\r\nRechteren and Mesnager. But as these are facts which are probably now\r\nforgot or unknown, it would not be amiss if they were related at large\r\nin the notes; which may be done from the gazettes, or any other\r\nnewspapers of those times. This is all I have to offer to your\r\nconsideration....\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See note on page 95 of this volume.]\r\n\r\nThere is thus no doubt left as to which were the tracts referred to by\r\nKing, and as to the desire of Swift to include Sir Thomas Hanmer's\r\nRepresentation--two points that are important as evidence for the\r\nauthenticity of the edition issued by Lucas in 1758.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of 1737, it must have become common knowledge among\r\nSwift's friends in London, that he was preparing for publication his\r\n\"History of the Four Last Years of Queen Anne's Reign.\" Possibly King\r\nmay have dropped a hint of it; possibly Swift may have written to others\r\nfor information and assistance. Be that as it may, on April 7th, 1737,\r\nthe Earl of Oxford (son of Swift's old friend) wrote to Swift as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"... One reason of my writing to you now is, (next to my asking\r\n    your forgiveness) this: I am told that you have given leave and\r\n    liberty to some one or more of your friends to print a history\r\n    of the last four years of Queen Anne's reign, wrote by you.\r\n\r\n    \"As I am most truly sensible of your constant regard and sincere\r\n    friendship for my father, even to partiality, (if I may say so,)\r\n    I am very sensible of the share and part he must bear in such a\r\n    history; and as I remember, when I read over that history of\r\n    yours, I can recollect that there seemed to me a want of some\r\n    papers to make it more complete, which was not in our power to\r\n    obtain; besides there were some severe things said, which might\r\n    have been very currently talked of; but now will want a proper\r\n    evidence to support; for these reasons it is that I do entreat\r\n    the favour of you, and make it my earnest request, that you will\r\n    give your positive directions, that this history be not printed\r\n    and published, until I have had an opportunity of seeing it;\r\n    with a liberty of showing it to some family friends, whom I\r\n    would consult upon this occasion. I beg pardon for this; I hope\r\n    you will be so good as to grant my request: I do it with great\r\n    deference to you. If I had the pleasure of seeing you, I would\r\n    soon say something to you that would convince you I am not\r\n    wrong: they are not proper for a letter as you will easily\r\n    guess....\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Swift had gone so far as to consult with Faulkner on\r\nthe matter of the printing of the \"History,\" because he was present when\r\nOxford's letter arrived, and he tells us that Swift answered the letter\r\nimmediately, and made him read the answer, the purport of which was:\r\n\"That although he loved his lordship's father more than he ever did any\r\nman; yet, as a human creature, he had his faults, and therefore, as an\r\nimpartial writer, he could not conceal them.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of June, 1737, Swift wrote at length to Oxford a letter in\r\nwhich he details the circumstances and the reasons which moved him to\r\nwrite the History. The letter is important, and runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"MY LORD,\r\n\r\n    \"I had the honour of a letter from your lordship, dated April\r\n    the 7th, which I was not prepared to answer until this time.\r\n    Your lordship must needs have known, that the History you\r\n    mention, of the Four last Years of the Queen's Reign, was\r\n    written at Windsor, just upon finishing the peace; at which\r\n    time, your father and my Lord Bolingbroke had a misunderstanding\r\n    with each other, that was attended with very bad consequences.\r\n    When I came to Ireland to take this deanery (after the peace was\r\n    made) I could not stay here above a fortnight, being recalled by\r\n    a hundred letters to hasten back, and to use my endeavours in\r\n    reconciling those ministers. I left them the history you\r\n    mention, which I finished at Windsor, to the time of the peace.\r\n    When I returned to England, I found their quarrels and coldness\r\n    increased. I laboured to reconcile them as much as I was able: I\r\n    contrived to bring them to my Lord Masham's, at St. James's. My\r\n    Lord and Lady Masham left us together. I expostulated with them\r\n    both, but could not find any good consequences. I was to go to\r\n    Windsor next day with my lord-treasurer; I pretended business\r\n    that prevented me, expecting they would come to some\r\n    [agreement?]. But I followed them to Windsor; where my Lord\r\n    Bolingbroke told me, that my scheme had come to nothing. Things\r\n    went on at the same rate; they grew more estranged every day. My\r\n    lord-treasurer found his credit daily declining. In May before\r\n    the Queen died, I had my last meeting with them at my Lord\r\n    Masham's. He left us together; and therefore I spoke very freely\r\n    to them both; and told them, 'I would retire, for I found all\r\n    was gone'. Lord Bolingbroke whispered me, 'I was in the right'.\r\n    Your father said, 'All would do well'. I told him, 'That I would\r\n    go to Oxford on Monday, since I found it was impossible to be of\r\n    any use'. I took coach to Oxford on Monday, went to a friend in\r\n    Berkshire, there stayed until the Queen's death, and then to my\r\n    station here, where I stayed twelve years, and never saw my lord\r\n    your father afterward. They could not agree about printing the\r\n    History of the Four last Years and therefore I have kept it to\r\n    this time, when I determine to publish it in London, to the\r\n    confusion of all those rascals who have accused the queen and\r\n    that ministry of making a bad peace, to which that party\r\n    entirely owes the Protestant succession. I was then in the\r\n    greatest trust and confidence with your father the\r\n    lord-treasurer, as well as with my Lord Bolingbroke, and all\r\n    others who had part in the administration I had all the letters\r\n    from the secretary's office, during the treaty of peace out of\r\n    those, and what I learned from the ministry, I formed that\r\n    History, which I am now going to publish for the information of\r\n    posterity, and to control the most impudent falsehoods which\r\n    have been published since. I wanted no kind of materials. I knew\r\n    your father better than you could at that time, and I do\r\n    impartially think him the most virtuous minister, and the most\r\n    able, that ever I remember to have read of. If your lordship has\r\n    any particular circumstances that may fortify what I have said\r\n    in the History, such as letters or materials, I am content they\r\n    should be printed at the end, by way of appendix. I loved my\r\n    lord your father better than any other man in the world,\r\n    although I had no obligation to him on the score of preferment,\r\n    having been driven to this wretched kingdom, to which I was\r\n    almost a stranger, by his want of power to keep me in what I\r\n    ought to call my own country, although I happened to be dropped\r\n    here, and was a year old before I left it, and to my sorrow did\r\n    not die before I came back to it again. As to the History, it\r\n    is only of affairs which I know very well and had all the\r\n    advantages possible to know, when you were in some sort but a\r\n    lad. One great design of it is, to do justice to the ministry at\r\n    that time, and to refute all the objections against them, as if\r\n    they had a design of bringing in Popery and the Pretender: and\r\n    farther to demonstrate, that the present settlement of the crown\r\n    was chiefly owing to my lord your father....\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Oxford had failed to extract the manuscript from Swift for\r\nthe purpose he had expressed in his letter. But his friend and Swift's\r\nold friend, Erasmus Lewis, who had been Under-Secretary of State during\r\nLord Oxford's administration, came to the Earl's assistance. He had not\r\nwritten to Swift for many years, but on June 30th, 1737, he took\r\noccasion to renew the correspondence and referred to the proposal for\r\npublishing the History in a manner which leaves no doubt as to who\r\nsuggested to him to write:\r\n\r\n    \" ... Now I name him, I mean Lord Oxford, let me ask you if it\r\n    be true, that you are going to print a History of the Four Last\r\n    Years of the Queen? if it is, will not you let me see it before\r\n    you send it to the press? Is it not possible that I may suggest\r\n    some things that you may have omitted, and give you reasons for\r\n    leaving out others? The scene is changed since that period of\r\n    time: the conditions of the peace of Utrecht have been applauded\r\n    by most part of mankind, even in the two Houses of Parliament:\r\n    should not matters rest here, at least for some time? I presume\r\n    your great end is to do justice to truth; the second point may\r\n    perhaps be to make a compliment to the Oxford family: permit me\r\n    to say as to the first, that though you know perhaps more than\r\n    any one man, I may possibly contribute a mite; and, with the\r\n    alteration of one word, viz. by inserting _parva_ instead of\r\n    _magna_, apply to myself that passage of Virgil, _et quorum pars\r\n    parva fui_. As to the second point, I do not conceive your\r\n    compliment to Lord Oxford to be so perfect as it might be,\r\n    unless you lay the manuscript before him, that it may be\r\n    considered here.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1737, Oxford replied to Swift's letter of the 4th of\r\nJune (referring to it as of the 14th of June), and emphasizes his\r\nearnest wish to see the manuscript. He also asks that it may be\r\npermitted him to show it to some friends:\r\n\r\n    \"GOOD MR. DEAN,\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter of June 14th, in answer to mine of the 7th of\r\n    April, is come to my hands; and it is with no small concern that\r\n    I have read it, and to find that you seem to have formed a\r\n    resolution to put the History of the Four last Years of the\r\n    Queen to the press; a resolution taken without giving your\r\n    friends, and those that are greatly concerned, some notice, or\r\n    suffering them to have time and opportunity to read the papers\r\n    over, and to consider them. I hope it is not too late yet, and\r\n    that you will be so good as to let some friends see them, before\r\n    they are put to the press; and, as you propose to have the work\r\n    printed here, it will be easy to give directions to whom you\r\n    will please to give the liberty of seeing them; I beg I may be\r\n    one: this request I again repeat to you, and I hope you will\r\n    grant it. I do not doubt that there are many who will persuade\r\n    you to publish it; but they are not proper judges: their reasons\r\n    may be of different kinds, and their motives to press on this\r\n    work may be quite different, and perhaps concealed from you.\r\n\r\n    \"I am extremely sensible of the firm love and regard you had for\r\n    my father, and have for his memory; and upon that account it is\r\n    that I now renew my request, that you would at least defer this\r\n    printing until you have had the advice of friends. You have\r\n    forgot that you lent me the History to read when you were in\r\n    England, since my father died; I do remember it well. I would\r\n    ask your pardon for giving you this trouble; but upon this\r\n    affair I am so nearly concerned, that, if I did not my utmost to\r\n    prevent it, I should never forgive myself.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this correspondence was in progress, Swift had given the\r\nmanuscript to Lord Orrery to hand over to Dr. King. On June 24th, 1737,\r\nKing wrote to Swift stating that he had received a letter from Mrs.\r\nWhiteway in which he was told to expect the manuscript from the hands of\r\nLord Orrery. To Mrs. Whiteway he replied, on the same day, that he would\r\nwait on Lord Orrery to receive the papers. On July 23rd, 1737, Lord\r\nOrrery wrote to Swift informing him that \"Dr. King has his cargo.\"\r\n\r\nWith the knowledge that the manuscript was on its way to King, Swift\r\nwrote the following reply to Lewis's letter:\r\n\r\n    July 23, 1737.\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    \"While any of those who used to write to me were alive, I always\r\n    inquired after you. But, since your secretaryship in the queen's\r\n    time, I believed you were so glutted with the office, that you\r\n    had not patience to venture on a letter to an absent useless\r\n    acquaintance; and I find I owe yours to my Lord Oxford. The\r\n    History you mention was written above a year before the queen's\r\n    death. I left it with the treasurer and Lord Bolingbroke, when I\r\n    first came over to take this deanery. I returned in less than a\r\n    month; but the ministry could not agree about printing it. It\r\n    was to conclude with the peace. I staid in London above nine\r\n    months; but not being able to reconcile the quarrels between\r\n    those two, I went to a friend in Berkshire, and, on the queen's\r\n    death, came hither for good and all. I am confident you read\r\n    that History; as this Lord Oxford did, as he owns in his two\r\n    letters, the last of which reached me not above ten days ago.\r\n    You know, on the queen's death, how the peace and all\r\n    proceedings were universally condemned. This I knew would be\r\n    done; and the chief cause of my writing was, not to let such a\r\n    queen and ministry lie under such a load of infamy, or posterity\r\n    be so ill-informed, &c. Lord Oxford is in the wrong to be in\r\n    pain about his father's character, or his proceedings in his\r\n    ministry; which is so drawn, that his greatest admirers will\r\n    rather censure me for partiality; neither can he tell me\r\n    anything material out of his papers, which I was not then\r\n    informed of; nor do I know anybody but yourself who could give\r\n    me more light than what I then received; for I remember I often\r\n    consulted with you, and took memorials of many important\r\n    particulars which you told me, as I did of others, for four\r\n    years together. I can find no way to have the original delivered\r\n    to Lord Oxford, or to you; for the person who has it will not\r\n    trust it out of his hands; but, I believe, would be contented to\r\n    let it be read to either of you, if it could be done without\r\n    letting it out of his hands, although, perhaps, that may be too\r\n    late.\"\r\n\r\nSwift is evidently about to accede to the desires of his two friends,\r\nand Lewis, in his reply, takes it for granted that the manuscript will\r\nsoon be in his possession for perusal and examination:\r\n\r\n    London, Aug. 4, 1737.\r\n\r\n    \"I assure you, my dear Dean, 'twas matter of joy to me to\r\n    receive a letter from you, and I hope 'tis an earnest of many\r\n    more I may have hereafter, before you and I leave this world;\r\n    though I must tell you, that if you and I revive our former\r\n    Correspondence, you must indulge me the liberty of making use of\r\n    another hand; for whether it be owing to age, or writing\r\n    formerly whole nights by candle-light, or to both those causes,\r\n    my sight is so far impaired, that I am not able, without much\r\n    pain, to scratch out a letter.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not remember ever to have read your History. I own my\r\n    memory is much decayed; but still I think I could not have\r\n    forgotten a matter of so much consequence, and which must have\r\n    given me so great a pleasure. It is fresh in my mind, that Lord\r\n    Oxford and the Auditor desired you to confer with me upon the\r\n    subject matter of it; that we accordingly did so; and that the\r\n    conclusion was, you would bury everything in oblivion. We\r\n    reported this to those two, I mean to his lordship and his\r\n    uncle, and they acquiesced in it. Now I find you have finished\r\n    that piece. I ask nothing but what you grant in your letter of\r\n    July 23d, viz. That your friend shall read it to me, and forbear\r\n    sending it to the press, till you have considered the\r\n    objections, if any should be made.\r\n\r\n    \"In the meantime, I shall only observe to you in general, that\r\n    three and twenty years, for so long it is since the death of\r\n    Queen Anne, having made a great alteration in the world, and\r\n    that what was sense and reason then, is not so now; besides, I\r\n    am told you have treated some people's characters with a\r\n    severity which the present times will not bear, and may possibly\r\n    bring the author into much trouble, which would be matter of\r\n    great uneasiness to his friends. I know very well it is your\r\n    intention to do honour to the then treasurer. Lord Oxford knows\r\n    it; all his family and friends know it; but it is to be done\r\n    with great circumspection. It is now too late to publish a\r\n    pamphlet, and too early to publish a History.\r\n\r\n    \"It was always my opinion, that the best way of doing honour to\r\n    the treasurer, was to write a History of the Peace of Utrecht,\r\n    beginning with a short preamble concerning the calamitous state\r\n    of our debt, and ending with the breaking our army, and\r\n    restoring the civil power; that these great things were\r\n    completed under the administration of the Earl of Oxford, and\r\n    this should be his epitaph. Lord Bolingbroke is undoubtedly\r\n    writing a History, but I believe will not live to finish it,\r\n    because he takes it up too high, viz. from the Restoration. In\r\n    all probability he'll cut and slash Lord Oxford. This is only my\r\n    guess. I don't know it....\"\r\n\r\n    King must have taken the manuscript to Lord Oxford and Lewis,\r\n    and been present at its reading. When that reading actually took\r\n    place is not ascertainable; but there is no doubt that before\r\n    March 15th, 1738, King was aware of the criticisms made on it.\r\n    On that day he writes to Mr. Deane Swift, explaining that he has\r\n    been obliged to defer the publication until he has received\r\n    Swift's answers to the objections made by the friends who read\r\n    it. On April 25th, 1738, King wrote again to Mr. Deane Swift,\r\n    regretting that he could not see him, \"because I might have\r\n    talked over with you all the affair of this History, about which\r\n    I have been much condemned: and no wonder, since the Dean has\r\n    continually expressed his dissatisfaction that I have so long\r\n    delayed the publication of it. However, I have been in no fault:\r\n    on the contrary, I have consulted the Dean's honour, and the\r\n    safety of his person. In a word, the publication of this work,\r\n    as excellent as it is, would involve the printer, publisher,\r\n    author, and everyone concerned, in the greatest difficulties, if\r\n    not in a certain ruin; and therefore it will be absolutely\r\n    necessary to omit some of the characters....\"\r\n\r\nFrom which we gather that Lewis and the friends had been able to show\r\nKing the extreme inadvisability of publishing the work. Swift knew\r\nnothing of this at the time, but Lewis did not long keep him in doubt,\r\nand the letter Lewis wrote Swift on April 8th, 1738, sets forth at\r\nlength the objections and criticisms which had so changed King's\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n    \"London, April 8, 1738.\r\n\r\n    \"I can now acquaint you, my dear Dean, that I have at last had\r\n    the pleasure of reading your History, in the presence of Lord\r\n    O------d, and two or three more, who think, in all political\r\n    matters, just as you do, and are as zealous for your fame and\r\n    safety as any persons in the world. That part of it which\r\n    relates to the negotiations of peace, whether at London or at\r\n    Utrecht, they admire exceedingly, and declare they never yet saw\r\n    that, or any other transaction, drawn up with so much\r\n    perspicuity, or in a style so entertaining and instructive to\r\n    the reader, in every respect; but I should be wanting to the\r\n    sincerity of a friend, if I did not tell you plainly, that it\r\n    was the unanimous opinion of the company a great deal of the\r\n    first part should be retrenched, and many things altered.\r\n\r\n    \"1st, They conceive the first establishment of the South Sea\r\n    Company is not rightly stated, for no part of the debt then\r\n    unprovided for was paid: however the advantages arising to the\r\n    public were very considerable; for, instead of paying for all\r\n    provisions cent. per cent. dearer than the common market-price,\r\n    as we did in Lord Godolphin's times, the credit of the public\r\n    was immediately restored, and, by means of this scheme, put upon\r\n    as good a footing as the best private security.\r\n\r\n    \"2d, They think the transactions with Mr. Buys might have been\r\n    represented in a more advantageous light, and more to the honour\r\n    of that administration; and, undoubtedly they would have been so\r\n    by your pen, had you been master of all the facts.\r\n\r\n    \"3d, The D----  of M----'s courage not to be called in question.\r\n\r\n    \"4th, The projected design of an assassination they believe\r\n    true, but that a matter of so high a nature ought not to be\r\n    asserted without exhibiting the proofs.\r\n\r\n    \"5th, The present ministers, who are the rump of those whose\r\n    characters you have painted, shew too plainly that they have not\r\n    acted upon republican, or, indeed, any other principles, than\r\n    those of interest and ambition.\r\n\r\n    \"6th, Now I have mentioned characters, I must tell you they were\r\n    clearly of opinion, that if those you have drawn should be\r\n    published as they now stand, nothing could save the author's\r\n    printer and publishers from some grievous punishment. As we have\r\n    no traces of liberty now left but the freedom of the press, it\r\n    is the most earnest desire of your friends that you would strike\r\n    out all that you have said on that subject.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus, my dear Dean, I have laid before you, in a plain manner\r\n    the sentiments of those who were present when your History was\r\n    read; if I have mistaken in anything, I ask pardon of you and\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    \"I am not at liberty to name those who were present, excepting\r\n    only the E----  of O----d, who has charged me to return you his\r\n    thanks for what you have said of his father.\r\n\r\n    \"What I have to say from myself is, that there were persons in\r\n    the company to whose judgment I should pay entire deference. I\r\n    had no opportunity of paying any on this occasion, for I\r\n    concurred in the same opinion with them, from the bottom of my\r\n    heart, and therefore conjure you as you value your own fame as\r\n    an author, and the honour of those who were actors in the\r\n    important affairs that make the subject of your History, and as\r\n    you would preserve the liberty of your person, and enjoyment of\r\n    your fortune, you will not suffer this work to go to the press\r\n    without making some, or all the amendments proposed. I am, my\r\n    dear Dean, most sincerely and affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n    \"E.L.\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for your kind mention of me in your letter to Lord\r\n    Oxford.\r\n\r\n    \"I had almost forgot to tell you, you have mistaken the case of\r\n    the D---- of S----, which, in truth, was this, that his grace\r\n    appearing at court, in the chamber next to the council-chamber,\r\n    it was apprehended he would come into the cabinet-council; and\r\n    therefore the intended meeting was put off: whereas one would\r\n    judge, by your manner of stating it, that the council had met,\r\n    and adjourned abruptly upon his taking his place there.\r\n\r\n    \"I must add, that if you would so far yield to the opinions of\r\n    your friends, as to publish what you have writ concerning the\r\n    peace, and leave out everything that savours of acrimony and\r\n    resentment, it would, even now, be of great service to this\r\n    nation in general, and to them in particular, nothing having\r\n    been yet published on the peace of Utrecht in such a beautiful\r\n    and strong manner as you have done it. Once more, my dear Dean,\r\n    adieu; let me hear from you.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that Swift was again persuaded to abandon the\r\npublication of his History. Nothing further is heard of it, except a\r\nslight reference by Pope in a letter he wrote to Swift, under date May\r\n17th, 1739, in which Pope informed him that Bolingbroke (who is writing\r\nhis History of his own Time) has expressed his intention of differing\r\nfrom Swift's version, as he remembers it when he read the History in\r\n1727. The variation would relate in particular to the conduct of the\r\nEarl of Oxford.\r\n\r\nSlight as this reference is, there is yet enough in it to suggest\r\nanother reason why Swift should withhold the publication of his work. It\r\nmight be that this expressed intention of Bolingbroke's to animadvert on\r\nhis dear friend's conduct, would just move Swift to a final rejection of\r\nhis intention, and so, possibly, prevent Bolingbroke from publishing his\r\nown statement. However, the manuscript must have been returned, for\r\nnothing more was heard of it during Swift's lifetime.\r\n\r\nSwift died in 1745, and thirteen years later appeared the anonymously\r\nedited \"History of the Four Last Years.\" Is this the work which Swift\r\nwrote in 1713, which he permitted Pope and Bolingbroke to read in 1727,\r\nand which he prepared for publication in 1737?\r\n\r\nIn 1758 there was no doubt whatever raised, although there were at least\r\ntwo persons alive then--Lord Orrery and Dr. William King--who could\r\neasily have proved any forgery, had there been one.\r\n\r\nThe first suspicion cast on the work came from Dr. Johnson. Writing, in\r\nhis life of Swift, of the published version, he remarks, \"that it seemed\r\nby no means to correspond with the notions that I had formed of it from\r\na conversation that I once heard between the Earl of Orrery and old Mr.\r\nLewis.\" In what particulars this want of correspondence was made evident\r\nJohnson does not say. In any case, his suspicion cannot be received with\r\nmuch consideration, since the conversation he heard must have taken\r\nplace at least twenty years before he wrote the poet's life, and his\r\nrecollection of such a conversation must at least have been very hazy.\r\nJohnson's opinion is further deprived of weight when we read what he\r\nwrote of the History in the \"Idler,\" in 1759, the year after its\r\npublication, that \"the history had perished had not a straggling\r\ntranscript fallen into busy hands.\" If the straggling manuscript were\r\nworth anything, it must have had some claims to authenticity; and if it\r\nhad, then Johnson's recollection of what he heard Orrery and Lewis say,\r\ntwenty years or more after they had said it, goes for very little.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott concludes, from the fact that Swift sent the manuscript\r\nto Oxford and Lewis, that it was afterwards altered in accordance with\r\nLewis's suggestions. But a comparison of Lucas's text with Lewis's\r\nletter shows that nothing of the kind was done.\r\n\r\nLord Stanhope had \"very great reason to doubt\" the authenticity of the\r\nHistory, and considered it as \"falsely ascribed to Swift.\" What this\r\n\"very great reason\" was, his lordship nowhere stated.\r\n\r\nMacaulay, in a pencilled note in a copy of Orrery's \"Remarks\" (now in\r\nthe British Museum) describes the History as \"Wretched stuff; and I\r\nfirmly believe not Swift's.\" But Macaulay could scarcely have had much\r\nground for his note, since he took a description of Somers from the\r\nHistory, and embodied it in his own work as a specimen of what Somers's\r\nenemies said of him. If the History were a forgery, what object was\r\ngained in quoting from it, and who were the enemies who wrote it?\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1873, Lord Beaconsfield, then Mr. Disraeli, made a speech at\r\nGlasgow, in which he quoted from the History and spoke of the words as\r\nby Swift, a correspondent in the \"Times\" criticised him for his\r\nignorance in so doing. But the discussion which followed in the columns\r\nof that periodical left the matter just where it was, and, indeed,\r\njustified Beaconsfield. The matter was taken up by Mr. Edward Solly in\r\n\"Notes and Queries;\" but that writer threw no new light whatever on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBut the positive evidence in favour of the authenticity is so strong,\r\nthat one wonders how there could have been any doubt as to whether Swift\r\ndid or did not write the History.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we know that Swift was largely indebted for his facts\r\nto Bolingbroke, when that statesman was the War Secretary of Queen Anne.\r\nA comparison of those portions of Swift's History which contain the\r\nfacts with the Bolingbroke Correspondence, in which the same facts are\r\nembodied, will amply prove that Swift obtained them from this source,\r\nand as Swift was the one man of the time to whom such a favour was\r\ngiven, the argument in favour of Swift's authorship obtains an added\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, a careful reading of the correspondence between\r\nSwift and his friends on the subject of the publication of the History\r\nenables us to identify the references to the History itself. The\r\n\"characters\" are there; Sir Thomas Hanmer's Representation is also\r\nthere, and all the points raised by Erasmus Lewis may be told off, one\r\nby one.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, Dr. Birch, the careful collector, had, in 1742,\r\naccess to what he considered to be the genuine manuscript. This was\r\nthree years before Swift's death. He made an abstract of this manuscript\r\nat the time, and this abstract is now preserved in the British Museum.\r\nComparing the abstract with the edition published in 1758, there is no\r\ndoubt that the learned doctor had copied from a manuscript which, if it\r\nwere not genuine, was certainly the text of the work published in 1758\r\nas \"The History of the Four Last Years.\" But Dr. Birch's language\r\nsuggests that he believed the manuscript he examined to be in Swift's\r\nown handwriting. If that be so, there is no doubt whatever of the\r\nauthenticity. Birch was a very careful person, and had he had any doubts\r\nhe could easily have settled them by applying to the many friends of the\r\nDean, if not to the Dean himself. Moreover, it is absurd to believe that\r\na forged manuscript of Swift's would be shown about during Swift's\r\nlifetime without it being known as a forgery. Mrs. Whiteway alone would\r\nhave put a stop to its circulation had she suspected of the existence of\r\nsuch a manuscript.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be remembered that when the History was published in\r\n1758, Lord Orrery was still living. If the work were a forgery, why did\r\nnot Lord Orrery expose it? Nothing would have pleased him more. He had\r\nread the manuscript referred to in the Correspondence. He had carried it\r\nto Oxford and given it to King, at Swift's request. He knew all about\r\nit, and he said nothing.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, both negative and positive, lead us to the final\r\nconclusion that the History published in 1758 is practically the History\r\nreferred to in Swift's Correspondence, and therefore the authentic work\r\nof Swift himself. We say practically,  because there are some\r\ndifferences between it and the text published here. The differences have\r\nbeen recorded from a comparison between Lucas's version and the\r\ntranscript of a manuscript discovered in Dublin in 1857, and made by Mr.\r\nPercy Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald found that this manuscript contained\r\nmany corrections in Swift's own handwriting. At the time he came across\r\nit the manuscript was in the possession of two old ladies named Greene,\r\ngrand-daughters of Mrs. Whiteway, and grand-nieces of Swift himself. On\r\nthe title-page there was the following note:\r\n\r\n\"This is the originall manuscript of the History, corrected by me, and\r\ngiven into the custody of Mrs. Martha Whiteway by me Jonathan Swift,\r\nJune 15, 1737. seven.\r\n\r\n\"I send a fair copy of this History by the Earl of Orrery to be printed\r\nin England.\r\n\r\n\"JONATH. SWIFT.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzgerald was permitted to make a collation of this manuscript, and\r\nhis collation he sent to the late John Forster. It is now in the\r\nVictoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I regret that I have been unable to trace the existence of\r\nthis manuscript of Swift's \"History.\" Mr. Fitzgerald himself has no\r\nrecollection of having made the collation. \"Forty-five years ago,\" he\r\nwrites, \"is a long time to look back to,\" and he cannot recall the\r\nfact.]\r\n\r\nIf this manuscript be what, on the face of it, it claims to be, then the\r\nquestion of authenticity is for ever settled. As we have no doubt on\r\nthis point, the corrections and variations between this manuscript, as\r\ncollated by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald and the Lucas version, have been noted\r\nin the present edition.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 Lord Orrery issued his \"Remarks\" on the life and character of\r\nSwift. The work obtained for him a certain notoriety, and brought down\r\nupon him some severe censure from the friends of Swift who were still\r\nalive. But, whatever may have been Orrery's private opinion of Swift,\r\nthat should not invalidate any information as to fact of which he had\r\nthe knowledge to speak. Writing in that book of the History, he says:\r\n\"Dr. Swift left behind him few manuscripts. Not one of any consequence,\r\nexcept an account of the peace of Utrecht, which he called 'An History\r\nof the four last Years of Queen Anne.' The title of an history is too\r\npompous for such a performance. In the historical style, it wants\r\ndignity and candour: but as a pamphlet it will appear the best defence\r\nof Lord Oxford's administration, and the clearest account of the Treaty\r\nof Utrecht, that has hitherto been written.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Second edition, pp. 206-207.]\r\n\r\nThe most ardent and devoted of Swift's admirers could hardly find a\r\njuster criticism of the work. It should satisfy any unprejudiced reader\r\nof the printed History as we now have it, and to that extent emphasize\r\nthe authenticity.\r\n\r\nAn interesting sidelight on Swift's History is thrown by Chesterfield in\r\na letter he wrote to Dr. Chenevix, Bishop of Waterford, on May 23rd,\r\n1758. We must believe that the noble lord wrote in good faith and\r\ncertainly in the full belief that the work he was criticising was the\r\nwork of Swift. Chesterfield's criticism points directly to Swift as the\r\nauthor, since his justification for Bolingbroke's story is to be found\r\nin the work as Lucas printed it in 1758. Speaking of the History,\r\nChesterfield calls it \"a party pamphlet, founded on the lie of the day,\r\nwhich, as lord Bolingbroke who had read it often assured me, was coined\r\nand delivered out to him, to write Examiners, and other political papers\r\nupon. That spirit remarkably runs through it. Macarteney, for instance,\r\nmurdered duke Hamilton;[4] nothing is falser, for though Macarteney was\r\nvery capable of the vilest actions, he was guiltless of that, as I\r\nmyself can testify, who was at his trial on the king's bench, when he\r\ncame over voluntarily to take it, in the late king's time. There did not\r\nappear even the least ground for a suspicion of it; nor did Hamilton,\r\nwho appeared in court, pretend to tax him with it, which would have been\r\nin truth accusing himself of the utmost baseness, in letting the\r\nmurderer of his friend go off from the field of battle, without either\r\nresentment, pursuit, or even accusation, till three days afterwards.\r\nThis _lie_ was invented to inflame the Scotch nation against the Whigs;\r\nas the other, that prince Eugene intended to murder lord Oxford, by\r\nemploying a set of people called Mohocks, which society, by the way,\r\nnever existed, was calculated to inflame the mob of London. Swift took\r\nthose hints _de la meilleure foi du monde_, and thought them materials\r\nfor history. So far he is blameless.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See page 178 of this volume.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"Chesterfield's Works,\" pp. 498-499.]\r\n\r\nIgnoring Chesterfield's indignation, we must believe that the references\r\nmade by him to Macartney and Eugene, must have been in the manuscript\r\nBolingbroke read; else how could Bolingbroke tell Chesterfield of their\r\nmeaning? If this be so, we have a still further warrant for a strong\r\npresumption in favour of authenticity. There can really be very little\r\ndoubt on the matter.\r\n\r\nWhat we may doubt, however, is not the authenticity, but the value of\r\nthe History as an historical document. Without question, Swift wrote in\r\ngood faith; but he also wrote as a partisan, and a partisan with an\r\naffectionate leaning for the principal character in the drama he was\r\ndescribing. Orrery was right when he called it \"a pamphlet,\" and \"the\r\nbest defence of Lord Oxford's administration.\" As a pamphlet and as a\r\ndefence it has some claim on our attention. As a contribution to the\r\nhistory of the treaty of Utrecht it is of little account. Swift could\r\nnot, had he even known everything, write the true story of the\r\nnegotiations for publication at the time. In the first place, he would\r\nnever have attempted it--the facts would have been demoralizing; and in\r\nthe second place, had he accomplished it, its publication would have\r\nbeen a matter for much more serious consideration than was given even to\r\nthe story he did write. For Swift's purpose, it was much better that he\r\ndid not know the full extent of the ministry's perfidy. His affection\r\nfor Oxford and his admiration for Bolingbroke would have received a\r\ngreat shock. He knew their weaknesses of character, though not their\r\ninfidelity to honour. There can be no defence of the Oxford\r\nadministration, for the manner in which it separated England from its\r\nallies and treated with a monarch who was well known to it as a\r\npolitical chicaner. The result brought a treaty by which Louis XIV.\r\ngained and the allies lost, and this in spite of the offers previously\r\nmade by the bankrupt monarch at Gertruydenberg.\r\n\r\nThe further contents of this volume deal with what might better be\r\ncalled Swiftiana. They include a collection of very interesting\r\nannotations made by Swift in his copies of Macky's \"Characters,\"\r\nClarendon's \"History of the Rebellion,\" Burnet's \"History of his Own\r\nTime,\" and Addison's \"Freeholder.\" The notes to Clarendon and Burnet\r\nhave always found an important place in the many editions of these\r\nwell-known works which have been issued from time to time. As here\r\nreprinted, however, they have in all cases been compared with the\r\noriginals themselves. It will be found that very many additions have\r\nbeen made, the result of careful comparison and collation with the\r\noriginals in Swift's handwriting.\r\n\r\nMy obligations are again due to Mr. W. Spencer Jackson for very valuable\r\nassistance in the collation of texts; to Mr. George Ravenscroft Dennis\r\nfor several important suggestions; to Mr. Percy Fitzgerald for the use I\r\nhave made of his transcriptions; and to Mr. Strickland of the National\r\nGallery of Ireland for his help in the matter of Swift portraits.\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to Mr. C. Litton Falkiner of Killiney, co.\r\nWicklow, for his untiring assistance to me during my stay in Dublin; to\r\nthe Very Rev. the Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral for permission to\r\nconsult the Marsh collection; and to the Rev.

This Lucas was the patriot who created such a stir in\r\nIrish politics between the years 1743 and 1750. Lord Townshend, in a\r\nletter to the Marquis of Granby, called him \"the Wilkes of Ireland.\" As\r\nan author he seems to have been very prolific, though of no polish in\r\nhis writings. Lucas's disclaimers of sympathy with the opinions\r\ncontained in the work he edited are somewhat over-stated, and his\r\ncriticisms are petty. A full account of this hot-headed physician may be\r\nfound in the Dictionary of National Biography. It was Dr. Johnson, in\r\nhis life of Swift, who first published the information that Lucas edited\r\nthis \"History.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n_Thus, the long wished for_ History of the Four Last Years of the\r\nQueen's Reign _is at length brought to light, in spite of all attempts\r\nto suppress it_!\r\n\r\nAs this publication is not made under the sanction of the name, or\r\nnames, which the author and the world had a right to expect; it is fit\r\nsome account of the works appearing in this manner should be here given.\r\n\r\nLong before the Dean's apparent decline, some of his intimate friends,\r\nwith concern, foresaw the impending fate of his fortune and his works.\r\nTo this it is owing, that these sheets, which the world now despaired of\r\never seeing, are rescued from obscurity, perhaps from destruction.\r\n\r\nFor this, the public is indebted to a gentleman, now in Ireland, of the\r\ngreatest probity and worth, with whom the Dean long lived in perfect\r\nintimacy. To this gentleman's hands the Dean entrusted a copy of his\r\nHistory, desiring him to peruse and give his judgment of it, with the\r\nlast corrections and amendments the author had given it, in his own\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHis friend read, admired, and approved. And from a dread of so valuable\r\nand so interesting a work's being by any_ _accident lost or effaced, as\r\nwas probable by its not being intended to be published in the author's\r\nlifetime; he resolved to keep this copy, till the author should press\r\nhim for it; but with a determined purpose, it should never see the\r\nlight, while there was any hopes of the author's own copy being\r\npublished, or even preserved.\r\n\r\nThis resolution he inviolably kept, till he and the world had full\r\nassurance, that the Dean's executors, or those into whose hands the\r\noriginal copy fell, were so far from intending to publish it, that it\r\nwas actually suppressed, perhaps destroyed.\r\n\r\nThen, he thought himself not only at liberty, but judged it his duty to\r\nhis departed friend, and to the public, to let this copy, which he had\r\nnow kept many years most secretly, see the light.\r\n\r\nThus it has at length fallen into the hands of a person, who publishes\r\nit for the satisfaction of the public, abstracted from all private\r\nregards; which are never to be permitted to come in competition with the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nEvery judicious eye will see, that the author of these sheets wrote with\r\nstrong passions, but with stronger prepossessions and prejudices in\r\nfavour of a party. These, it may be imagined, the editor, in some\r\nmeasure, may have adopted, and published this work as a kind of support\r\nof that party, or some surviving remnant thereof.\r\n\r\nIt is but just to undeceive the reader, and inform him from what kind of\r\nhand he has received this work. A man may regard a good piece of\r\npainting, while he despises the subject; if the subject be ever so\r\ndespicable, the masterly strokes of the painter may demand our\r\nadmiration, while he, in other respects, is entitled to no portion of\r\nour regard.\r\n\r\nIn poetry, we carry our admiration still farther; and like the poet,\r\nwhile we actually contemn the man. Historians share the like fate; hence\r\nsome, who have no regard to propriety or truth, are yet admired for\r\ndiction, style, manner, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe editor considers this work in another light. He long knew the\r\nauthor, and was no stranger to his politics, connections, tendencies,\r\npassions, and the whole economy of his life. He has long been hardily\r\nsingular in condemning this great man's conduct amid the admiring\r\nmultitude, nor ever could have thought of making an interest in a man,\r\n_whose principles and manners he could by no rule of reason or honour\r\napprove, however he might have admired his parts and wit_.\r\n\r\n_Such was judged the disposition of the man, whose history of the most\r\ninteresting period of time in the annals of Britain are now, herein,\r\noffered to the reader. He may well ask from what motives? The answer is\r\neasily, simply given_.\r\n\r\n_The causes assigned for delaying the publication of this history were\r\nprincipally these:_[2] _That the manuscript fell into the hands of men,\r\nwho, whatever they might have been by the generality deemed, were by the\r\nDean believed to be of his party, though they did not, after his death,\r\njudge it prudent to avow his principles, more than to deny them in his\r\nlifetime. These men, having got their beavers, tobacco-boxes, and other\r\ntrifling remembrances of former friendship, by the Dean's will, did not\r\nchoose publicly to avow principles, that had marred their friend's\r\npromotion, and might probably put a stop to theirs. Therefore, they gave\r\nthe inquisitive world to understand, that there was something too strong\r\nagainst many great men, as well as the succeeding system of public\r\naffairs in general, in the Dean's_ History of the Four Last Years of the\r\nQueen's Reign, _to admit of a publication, in our times; and, with this\r\npoor insinuation, excused themselves, and satisfied the weakly\r\nwell-affected, in suppressing the manifestation of displeasing truths,\r\nof however great importance to society_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The causes for the delay in the publication of the\r\n\"History\" are given at length by the present editor in the Introduction.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\n_This manuscript has now fallen into the hands of a man, who never could\r\nassociate with, or even approve, any of the parties or factions, that\r\nhave differently distracted, it might be said disgraced, these kingdoms;\r\nbecause he has as yet known none, whose motives or rules of action were\r\ntruth and the public good alone; of one, who judges, that perjured\r\nmagistrates of all denominations, and their most exalted minions, may be\r\nexposed, deprived, or cut off, by the fundamental laws of his country;\r\nand who, upon these principles, from his heart approves and glories in\r\nthe virtues of his predecessors, who revived the true spirit of the\r\nBritish polity, in laying aside a priest-ridden, an hen-pecked,\r\ntyrannical tool, who had overturned the political constitution of his\r\ncountry, and in reinstituting the dissolved body politic, by a\r\nrevolution supported by the laws of nature and the realm, as the only\r\nmeans of preserving the natural and legal, the civil and religious\r\nliberties of the members of the commonwealth_.\r\n\r\n_Truth, in this man's estimation, can hurt no good cause. And falsehood\r\nand fraud, in religion and politics, are ever to be detected, to be\r\nexploded_.\r\n\r\n_Insinuations, that this History contained something injurious to the\r\npresent establishment, and therefore necessary to be suppressed, serve\r\nbetter the purposes of mistaken or insidious malcontents than the real\r\npublication can. And, if any thing were by this, or any other, History\r\nto be shown essentially erroneous in our politics, who, that calls\r\nhimself a Briton, can be deemed such an impious slave, as to conceal the\r\ndestructive evil? The editor of this work disdains and abhors the\r\nservile thought, and wishes to live no longer than he dares to think,\r\nspeak, write, and, in all things, to act worthy of a Briton_.\r\n\r\n_From this regard to truth and to his country, the editor of this\r\nHistory was glad of an opportunity of rescuing such a writing from those\r\nwho meant to suppress it. The common cause, in his estimation, required\r\nand demanded it should be done; and the sooner it is published, he\r\njudged, the better: for, if the conduct of the Queen and her ministers\r\ndoes not deserve the obloquy that has been long industriously cast upon\r\nit, what is more just than to vindicate it? What more reasonable than\r\nthat this should be done, while living witnesses may yet be called, to\r\nprove or disprove the several allegations and assertions; since, in a\r\nfew years more, such witnesses may be as much wanting as to prevent a\r\ncanonization, which is therefore prudently procrastinated for above an\r\nage? Let us then coolly hear what is to be said on this side the\r\nquestion, and judge like Britons._\r\n\r\n_The editor would not be thought to justify the author of this History,\r\nin all points, or even to attempt to acquit him of unbecoming prejudices\r\nand partiality. Without being deeply versed in history or politics, he\r\ncan see his author, in many instances, blinded with passions that\r\ndisgrace the historian; and blending, with phrases worthy of a Caesar or\r\na Cicero, expressions not to be justified by truth, reason, or common\r\nsense, yet think him a most powerful orator, and a great historian._\r\n\r\n_No unprejudiced person will blame the Dean for doing all that is\r\nconsistent with truth and decency to vindicate the government of the\r\nQueen, and to exculpate the conduct of her ministers and her last\r\ngeneral; all good men would rejoice at such a vindication. But, if he\r\nmeant no more than this, his work would ill deserve the title of an\r\nHistory. That he generally tells truths, and founds his most material\r\nassertions upon fact, will, I think be found very evident. But there is\r\nroom to suspect, that, while he tells no more than the truth, he does\r\nnot tell the whole truth. However, he makes it very clear, that the\r\nQueen's allies, especially our worthy friends the Dutch, were much to\r\nblame for the now generally condemned conduct of the Queen, with regard\r\nto the prosecution of the war and the bringing about the peace_.\r\n\r\n_The authors drawings of characters are confessedly partial: for he\r\ntells us openly, he means not to give characters entire, but such parts\r\nof each man's particular passions, acquirements, and habits, as he was\r\nmost likely to transfer into his political schemes. What writing, what\r\nsentence, what character, can stand this torture?--What extreme\r\nperversion may not, let me say, does not, this produce? Yet thus does he\r\nchoose to treat all men, that were not favourers of the latest measures\r\nof the Queen, when the best that has been said for her, shows no more\r\nthan that she was blindfolded and held in leading-strings by her\r\nministers_.\r\n\r\n_He does not spare a man, confessed by all the world to have discharged\r\nthe duties of his function like a soldier, like an hero. But charges\r\nPrince Eugene with raising and keeping up a most horrible mob, with\r\nintent to assassinate Harley. For all which odious charges he offers not\r\none individual point of proof_.\r\n\r\n_He is not content with laying open again the many faults already\r\npublicly proved upon the late Duke of Marlborough, but insinuates a new\r\ncrime, by seeming to attempt to acquit him of aspiring at the throne.\r\nBut this is done in a manner peculiar to this author_.\r\n\r\n_On the other hand, he extols the ministers, and minions of the Queen,\r\nin the highest terms; and while he robs their antagonists of every good\r\nquality, generally gives those wisdom and every virtue that can adorn\r\nhuman nature_.\r\n\r\n_He is not ashamed to attempt to justify, what all thinking good men\r\nmust condemn, the Queen's making twelve peers at once, to serve a\r\nparticular turn_.\r\n\r\n_All these may be ascribed to the strength of his passions, and to the\r\nprejudices, early imbibed, in favour of his indulgent royal mistress and\r\nher favourites and servants.[3] The judicious will look through the\r\nelegant clothing, and dispassionately consider these as mere human\r\nerrors, to which no well-informed mind can assent. The editor thinks\r\nhimself bound to protest against them_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: That Swift should have a strong partiality to Harley and\r\nSt. John, by whom he was respected and trusted to a most uncommon\r\ndegree, is natural and obvious; but upon what ground Queen Anne, who\r\ndisliked his person, and obstructed his preferment, is here termed his\r\n_indulgent_ mistress, the author of this preface ought to have\r\ncondescended to explain. [S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n_He makes a few lapses on the other side, without being as clear as an\r\nimpartial historian would choose to appear. He more than hints at the\r\nQueen's displeasure at its being moved in Parliament, that the Prince\r\nElector should be invited to reside in England, to whose crown he was by\r\nlaw declared presumptive heir, but is always open upon the Queen's\r\ninsisting on the Pretender's being sent out of France.--It is easy to\r\nsee how incompatible these things appear. Nothing could tend more to\r\nsecure the Hanover succession, and to enlarge its benefits to Britain,\r\nthan the bringing over the successor, who should, in every country, be\r\nwell instructed in the language, customs, manners, religion, and laws of\r\nhis future subjects, before he comes to hold the reins of government.\r\nAnd our author does not take the proper care to inform us how far the\r\nFrench thought fit to comply with banishing the Pretender their\r\ndominions, since many still live in doubt, that if he was sent out of\r\nFrance, he was sent into England_.\r\n\r\n_But there is one expression of our author too perverse, too grossly\r\nabused, to admit of any apology, of any palliation. It is not to be\r\nsupposed, that he was ignorant of any word in the English language. And\r\nleast of all can he be supposed ignorant of the meaning of a word,\r\nwhich, had it been ever so doubtful before, had a certain meaning\r\nimpressed upon it by the authority of Parliament, of which no sensible\r\nsubject can be ignorant_.\r\n\r\n_Notwithstanding this, where our author speaks of the late King James,\r\nhe calls him the_ abdicated King, _and gives the same epithet even to\r\nhis family. Though this weak, ill-advised, and ill-fated prince, in\r\nevery sense of the word, with Romans and English, and to all intents and\r\npurposes_, abdicated, _yet can he, in no sense, be called_ abdicated;\r\n_unless the people's asserting their rights, and defending themselves\r\nagainst a king, who broke his compact with his subjects, and overturned\r\ntheir government, can be called_ abdication _in them; which no man in\r\nhis senses can be hardy enough to support upon any principle of reason\r\nor the laws of England. Let the reader judge which this is most likely\r\nto be, error or design_.\r\n\r\n_These exceptions the editor thought himself bound to make to some parts\r\nof this work, to keep clear of the disagreeable imputations of being of\r\na party, of whatsoever denomination, in opposition to truth and the\r\nrights and liberties of the subject._\r\n\r\n_These laid aside, the work will be found to have many beauties, many\r\nexcellencies. Some have of late affected to depreciate this History,\r\nfrom an insinuation, made only since the author's death, to wit, that he\r\nwas never admitted into the secrets of the administration, but made to\r\nbelieve he was a confident, only to engage him in the list of the\r\nministerial writers of that reign_.\r\n\r\n_The falsehood of this will readily appear upon perusal of the work.\r\nThis shows he knew the most secret springs of every movement in the\r\nwhole complicated machine. That he states facts, too well known to be\r\ncontested, in elegant simplicity, and reasons upon them with the talents\r\nof the greatest historian. And thus makes an History, composed rather of\r\nnegotiations than actions, most entertaining, affecting, and\r\ninteresting, instead of being, as might be expected, heavy, dull, and\r\ndisagreeable_.\r\n\r\n_It is now fit to apologize for some errors, which the judicious must\r\ndiscover upon a perusal of this work. It is for this, among other\r\nreasons, much to be lamented, that this History was not published under\r\nthe author's own inspection. It is next to impossible to copy or print\r\nany work without faults, and most so where the author's eye is wanting_.\r\n\r\n_It is not to be imagined, that even our author, however accurate,\r\nhowever great, was yet strictly and perfectly correct in his writings.\r\nYet, where some seeming inaccuracies in style or expression have been\r\ndiscovered, the deference due to the author made any alteration too\r\npresumptuous a task for the editor. These are, therefore, left to the\r\namending hand of every sensible and polite reader; while the editor\r\nhopes it will suffice, that he should point out some of those errors,\r\nwhich are to be ascribed either to transcribers or the press, and which\r\nmay be rectified in the manner following, in reading the work._[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Here follows list of _errata_. (These errors have been\r\ncorrected in the present edition.)]\r\n\r\n_And thus; with these and perhaps some few such like corrections, it is\r\nhoped this work will be found completely correct._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The time when it was written does not appear; but it was\r\nprobably many years after the Queen's death. [N.] First published in\r\n1765. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving written the following History at Windsor, in the happy reign of\r\nHer Majesty Queen Anne, of ever glorious, blessed, and immortal memory;\r\nI resolved to publish it, for the satisfaction of my fellow-subjects, in\r\nthe year 1713; but, being under a necessity of going to Ireland, to take\r\npossession of the deanery of St. Patrick's, Dublin, I left the original\r\nwith the ministers; and having stayed in that kingdom not above a\r\nfortnight, I found, at my return, that my Lord Treasurer Oxford, and the\r\nsecretary my Lord Bolingbroke, who were then unhappily upon very ill\r\nterms with each other, could not agree upon publishing it, without some\r\nalterations which I would not submit to. Whereupon I kept it by me until\r\nHer Majesty's death, which happened about a year after.\r\n\r\nI have ever since preserved the original very safely; too well knowing\r\nwhat a turn the world would take upon the German family's succeeding to\r\nthe crown; which indeed was their undoubted right, having been\r\nestablished solemnly by the act of an undisputed Parliament, brought\r\ninto the House of Commons by Mr. Harley, who was then Speaker.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said in another discourse,[2] it was very well\r\nunderstood, some years before Her Majesty's death, how the new King\r\nwould act, immediately upon his entrance, in the choice of those (and\r\nthose alone) whom he resolved to trust; and consequently what reports\r\nwould industriously be raised, as well as spread, to expose the\r\nproceedings of Her Majesty herself, as well as of her servants; who have\r\nbeen ever since blasted as enemies to the present establishment, by the\r\nmost ignorant and malicious among mankind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Memoirs relating to the Change in the Queen's Ministry.\"\r\nSee vol. v. of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nTherefore, as it was my lot to have been daily conversant with the\r\npersons then in power; never absent in times of business or\r\nconversation, until a few weeks before Her Majesty's death; and a\r\nwitness of almost every step they made in the course of their\r\nadministration; I must have been very unfortunate not to be better\r\ninformed than those miserable pamphleteers, or their patrons, could\r\npretend to. At the same time, I freely confess, it appeared necessary,\r\nas well as natural, upon such a mighty change as the death of a\r\nsovereign, that those who were to be in power upon the succession, and\r\nresolved to act in every part by a direct contrary system of politics,\r\nshould load their predecessors with as much infamy as the most\r\ninveterate malice and envy could suggest, or the most stupid ignorance\r\nand credulity in their underlings could swallow.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as I pretend to write with the utmost impartiality, the\r\nfollowing History of the Four Last Years of her Majesty's Reign, in\r\norder to undeceive prejudiced persons at present, as well as posterity;\r\nI am persuaded in my own mind, as likewise by the advice of my oldest\r\nand wisest friends, that I am doing my duty to God and man, by\r\nendeavouring to set future ages right in their judgment of that happy\r\nreign; and, as a faithful historian, I cannot suffer falsehoods to run\r\non any longer, not only against all appearance of truth as well as\r\nprobability, but even against those happy events, which owe their\r\nsuccess to the very measures then fixed in the general peace.\r\n\r\nThe materials for this History, besides what I have already mentioned, I\r\nmean the confidence reposed in me for those four years, by the chief\r\npersons in power, were extracted out of many hundred letters written by\r\nour ambassadors abroad, and from the answers as well as instructions\r\nsent them by our secretaries of state, or by the first minister the Earl\r\nof Oxford. The former were all originals, and the latter copies entered\r\ninto books in the secretaries' office, out of both which I collected all\r\nthat I thought convenient; not to mention several Memorials given me by\r\nthe ministers at home. Further, I was a constant witness and observer of\r\nall that passed; and entered every particular of any consequence upon\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nI was so far from having any obligation to the crown, that, on the\r\ncontrary, Her Majesty issued a proclamation, offering three hundred\r\npounds to any person who would discover the author of a certain short\r\ntreatise,[3] which the Queen well knew to have been written by me. I\r\nnever received one shilling from the minister, or any other present,\r\nexcept that of a few books; nor did I want their assistance to support\r\nme. I very often dined indeed with the treasurer and secretary; but, in\r\nthose days, that was not reckoned a bribe, whatever it may have been at\r\nany time since. I absolutely refused to be chaplain to the Lord\r\nTreasurer; because I thought it would ill become me to be in a state of\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"The Public Spirit of the Whigs.\" [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nI say this, to shew that I had no other bias than my own opinion of\r\npersons and affairs. I preserved several of the opposite party in their\r\nemployments, who were persons of wit and learning, particularly Mr.\r\nAddison and Mr. Congreve, neither of whom were ever in any danger from\r\nthe treasurer, who much esteemed them both; and, by his lordship's\r\ncommands, I brought the latter to dine with him. Mr. Steele might have\r\nbeen safe enough, if his continually repeated indiscretions, and a zeal\r\nmingled with scurrilities, had not forfeited all title to lenity.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A full account of the severance of the friendly relations\r\nbetween Swift and Steele is given in the fifth volume of the present\r\nedition (see pp. 276-282). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI know very well the numberless prejudices of weak and deceived people,\r\nas well as the malice of those, who, to serve their own interest or\r\nambition, have cast off all religion, morality, justice, and common\r\ndecency. However, although perhaps I may not be believed in the present\r\nage, yet I hope to be so in the next, by all who will bear any regard\r\nfor the honour and liberty of England, if either of these shall then\r\nsubsist or not.\r\n\r\nI have no interest or inclination to palliate the mistakes, or\r\nomissions, or want of steadiness, or unhappy misunderstandings, among a\r\nfew of those who then presided in affairs.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common than the virulence of superficial and ill\r\ninformed writers, against the conduct of those who are now called prime\r\nministers: And, since factions appear at present to be at a greater\r\nheight than in any former times, although perhaps not so equally poised;\r\nit may probably concern those who are now in their height, if they have\r\nany regard for their own memories in future ages, to be less warm\r\nagainst others, who humbly differ from them in some state opinions. Old\r\npersons remember, at least by tradition, the horrible prejudices that\r\nprevailed against the first Earl of Clarendon, whose character, as it\r\nnow stands, might be a pattern for all ministers; although even Bishop\r\nBurnet of Sarum, whose principles, veracity, and manner of writing, are\r\nso little esteemed upon many accounts, hath been at the pains to\r\nvindicate him.\r\n\r\nUpon that irreparable breach between the treasurer and secretary\r\nBolingbroke, after my utmost endeavours, for above two years, to\r\nreconcile them, I retired to a friend in Berkshire, where I stayed until\r\nHer Majesty's death;[5] and then immediately returned to my station in\r\nDublin, where I continued about twelve years without once seeing\r\nEngland. I there often reviewed the following Memoirs; neither changing\r\nnor adding, further than by correcting the style: And, if I have been\r\nguilty of any mistakes, they must be of small moment; for it was hardly\r\npossible I could be wrong informed, with all the advantages I have\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See vol. v. of the present edition--the notes on pp. 390,\r\n393-394, 420, 421, and 426. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI shall not be very uneasy under the obloquy that may, perhaps, be cast\r\nupon me by the violent leaders and followers of the present prevailing\r\nparty. And yet I cannot find the least inconsistence with conscience or\r\nhonour, upon the death of so excellent a princess as her late Majesty,\r\nfor a wise and good man to submit, with a true and loyal heart, to her\r\nlawful Protestant successor; whose hereditary title was confirmed by the\r\nQueen and both Houses of Parliament, with the greatest unanimity, after\r\nit had been made an article in the treaty, that every prince in our\r\nalliance should be a guarantee of that succession. Nay, I will venture\r\nto go one step farther; that, if the negotiators of that peace had been\r\nchosen out of the most professed zealots for the interests of the\r\nHanover family, they could not have bound up the French king, or the\r\nHollanders, more strictly than the Queen's plenipotentiaries did, in\r\nconfirming the present succession; which was in them so much a greater\r\nmark of virtue and loyalty, because they perfectly well knew, that they\r\nshould never receive the least mark of favour, when the succession had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE HISTORY OF THE FOUR LAST\r\n  YEARS OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose give the public an account of the most important affairs at\r\nhome, during the last session of Parliament, as well as of our\r\nnegotiations of peace abroad, not only during that period, but some time\r\nbefore and since. I shall relate the chief matters transacted by both\r\nHouses in that session, and discover the designs carried on by the heads\r\nof a discontented party,[1] not only against the ministry, but, in some\r\nmanner, against the crown itself. I likewise shall state the debts of\r\nthe nation, show by what mismanagement, and to serve what purposes, they\r\nwere at first contracted, by what negligence or corruption they have so\r\nprodigiously grown, and what methods have since been taken to provide\r\nnot only for their payment, but to prevent the like mischief for the\r\ntime to come. Although, in an age like ours, I can expect very few\r\nimpartial readers, yet I shall strictly follow truth, or what reasonably\r\nappeared to me to be such, after the most impartial inquiries I could\r\nmake, and the best opportunities of being informed, by those who were\r\nthe principal actors or advisers.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: P. Fitzgerald says \"faction.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Swift's informants were, of course, Harley and Bolingbroke,\r\nthough the latter stated that Swift was given only such information as\r\nserved the ministry's purpose in the work they had given him for \"The\r\nExaminer\" and the party pamphlets written in their defence. It is,\r\nhowever, quite interesting in this connection, to see how closely\r\nSwift's narrative follows the published political correspondence of\r\nBolingbroke. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nNeither shall I mingle panegyric or satire with an history intended to\r\ninform posterity, as well as to instruct those of the present age, who\r\nmay be ignorant or misled; since facts, truly related, are the best\r\napplauses, or most lasting reproaches.\r\n\r\nDiscourses upon subjects relating to the public usually seem to be\r\ncalculated for London only, and some few miles about it; while the\r\nauthors suppose their readers to be informed of several particulars, to\r\nwhich those that live remote are, for the generality, utter strangers.\r\nMost people, who frequent this town, acquire a sort of smattering (such\r\nas it is), which qualifies them for reading a pamphlet, and finding out\r\nwhat is meant by innuendoes, or hints at facts or persons, and initial\r\nletters of names, wherein gentlemen at a distance, although perhaps of\r\nmuch better understandings, are wholly in the dark. Wherefore, that\r\nthese Memoirs may be rendered more generally intelligible and useful, it\r\nwill be convenient to give the reader a short view of the state and\r\ndisposition of affairs, when the last session of Parliament began. And\r\nbecause the party-leaders, who had lost their power and places, were,\r\nupon that juncture, employing all their engines, in an attempt to\r\nre-establish themselves, I shall venture one step further, and represent\r\nso much of their characters as may be supposed to have influenced their\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day of December, one thousand seven hundred and eleven,\r\nbegan the second session of Parliament. It was now above a year since\r\nthe Queen had thought fit to put the great offices of state, and of her\r\nown household, into other hands; however, three of the discontented\r\nlords were still in possession of their places, for the Duke of\r\nMarlborough continued general, the Duke of Somerset master of the horse,\r\nand the Earl of Cholmondeley treasurer of Her Majesty's household;[3]\r\nlikewise great numbers of the same party[4] still kept employments of\r\nvalue and importance, which had not been usual of late years upon any\r\nchanges of ministry. The Queen, who judged the temper of her people by\r\nthis House of Commons, which a landed interest had freely chosen, found\r\nthem very desirous of a secure and honourable peace, and disposed[5] to\r\nleave the management of it to her own wisdom, and that of her own\r\ncouncil. She had, therefore, several months before the session began,\r\nsent to inform the States General of some overtures which had been made\r\nher by the enemy; and, during that summer, Her Majesty took several\r\nfarther steps in that great affair, until at length, after many\r\ndifficulties, a congress at Utrecht, for a general peace, was agreed\r\nupon, the whole proceedings of which previous negotiations, between our\r\ncourt and that of France, I shall, in its proper place, very\r\nparticularly relate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See note on p. 385 of vol. v. of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: P. Fitzgerald says \"the ejected party.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: P. Fitzgerald adds \"(as it was their duty).\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe nation was already upon a better foot, with respect to its debts;\r\nfor the Earl of Oxford, lord treasurer, had, in the preceeding session,\r\nproposed and effected ways and means, in the House of Commons (where he\r\nwas then a member), for providing a parliamentary fund, to clear the\r\nheavy arrear of ten millions (whereof the greatest part lay upon the\r\nnavy), without any new burthen (at least after a very few years) to the\r\nkingdom; and, at the same time, he took care to prevent farther\r\nincumbrances upon that article, by finding ready money for naval\r\nprovisions, which has saved the public somewhat more than _cent. per\r\ncent_. in that mighty branch of our expenses.\r\n\r\nThe clergy were altogether in the interests and the measures of the\r\npresent ministry, which had appeared so boldly in their defence, during\r\na prosecution against one of their members,[6] where the whole sacred\r\norder was understood to be concerned. The zeal shown for that most\r\nreligious bill, to settle a fund for building fifty new churches in and\r\nabout the city of London,[7] was a fresh obligation; and they were\r\nfarther highly gratified, by Her Majesty's choosing one of their body to\r\nbe a great officer of state.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Dr. Sacheverell. [N.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: A suggestion originally made by Swift himself. See vol.\r\niii., p. 45, of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Dr. Robinson, Lord Bishop of Bristol, to be Lord Privy\r\nSeal. [ORIGINAL NOTE.] Dr. Robinson, who was appointed Bishop of London\r\nin 1713, died in 1723. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nBy this time likewise, all disputes about these principles, which used\r\noriginally to divide Whig and Tory, were wholly dropped; and those\r\nfantastical words ought in justice to have been so too, provided we\r\ncould have found out more convenient names, whereby to distinguish\r\nlovers of peace from lovers of war;[9] or those who would leave Her\r\nMajesty some degree of freedom in the choice of her ministers, from\r\nothers, who could not be satisfied with her choosing any, except such as\r\nshe was most averse from. But, where a nation is once divided, interest\r\nand animosity will keep open the breach, without being supported by any\r\nother principles; or, at worst, a body of discontented people can\r\nchange, and take up what principles they please.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Swift had already, in his \"Some Free Thoughts upon the\r\nPresent State of Affairs,\" attempted to re-define the distinctions of\r\nWhig and Tory. The latter, he urged, was of that party which pronounced\r\nfor the principles of loyalty to the Church and the preservation of the\r\nProtestant succession in the House of Hanover. Swift felt that the\r\nmajority of the people at large were strong for these principles, and\r\nthe party that would openly accept them as its \"platform\" would, he\r\nargued, be the party that would obtain the people's support. Had\r\nBollngbroke not delayed the publication of this tract, it might have had\r\ngreat influence in keeping the Tories in power. See vol. v. of present\r\nedition, pp. 380, 393. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAs to the disposition of the opposite party, we all remember, that the\r\nremoval of the last ministry was brought about by several degrees;\r\nthrough which means it happened, that they and their friends were hardly\r\nrecovered out of one astonishment, before they fell into another. This\r\nscene lasted for some months, and was followed by a period of rage and\r\ndespair, natural to those who reflect that they have lost a secure game,\r\nby their own rashness, folly, and want of common management, when, at\r\nthe same time, they knew by experience, that a watchful and dexterous\r\nadversary lay ready to take the advantage. However, some time before the\r\nsession, the heads of that party began to recollect themselves, and\r\nrally their forces, like an enemy who hath been beaten out of the field,\r\nbut finds he is not pursued; for although the chiefs of this faction\r\nwere thought to have but little esteem or friendship for each other, yet\r\nthey perfectly agreed in one general end, of distressing, by all\r\npossible methods, the new administration, wherein if they could succeed\r\nso far as to put the Queen under any great necessity, another Parliament\r\nmust be called, and perhaps the power[10] devolve again into their own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: P. Fitzgerald says \"and the power naturally.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe issue and event of that grand confederacy appearing in both Houses,\r\nalthough under a different form, upon the very first day the Parliament\r\nmet, I cannot better begin the relation of affairs, commencing from that\r\nperiod, than by a thorough detection of the whole intrigue, carried on\r\nwith the greatest privacy and application, which must be acknowledged to\r\nhave for several days disconcerted some of the ministry, as well as\r\ndispirited their friends; and the consequences thereof, which have in\r\nreality been so very pernicious to the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut because the principal leaders in this design are the same persons to\r\nwhom, since the loss of their power, all the opposition has been owing\r\nwhich the court received, either in treaties abroad, or the\r\nadministration at home; it may not be improper to describe those\r\nqualities in each of them, which few of their admirers will deny, and\r\nwhich appear chiefly to have influenced them in acting their several\r\nparts upon the public stage. For I do not intend to draw their\r\ncharacters entire, which would be tedious, and little to the purpose,\r\nbut shall only single out those passions, acquirements, and habits,\r\nwhich the owners were most likely to transfer into their political\r\nschemes, and which were most subservient to the designs they seemed to\r\nhave in view.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Somers[11] may very deservedly be reputed the head and oracle\r\nof that party; he hath raised himself, by the concurrence of many\r\ncircumstances, to the greatest employments of the state, without the\r\nleast support from birth or fortune; he hath constantly, and with great\r\nsteadiness, cultivated those principles under which he grew. That\r\naccident which first produced him into the world, of pleading for the\r\nbishops whom King James had sent to the Tower, might have proved a piece\r\nof merit, as honourable as it was fortunate, but the old republican\r\nspirit, which the Revolution had restored, began to teach other\r\nlessons--That since we had accepted a new King, from a Calvinistical\r\ncommonwealth, we must also admit new maxims in religion and government.\r\nBut, since the nobility and gentry would probably adhere to the\r\nestablished Church, and to the rights of monarchy, as delivered down\r\nfrom their ancestors, it was the practice of those politicians to\r\nintroduce such men as were perfectly indifferent to any or no religion,\r\nand who were not likely to inherit much loyalty from those to whom they\r\nowed their birth. Of this number was the person I am now describing. I\r\nhave hardly known any man, with talents more proper to acquire and\r\npreserve the favour of a prince; never offending in word or gesture; in\r\nthe highest degree courteous and complaisant; wherein he set an\r\nexcellent example to his colleagues, which they did not think fit to\r\nfollow. But this extreme civility is universal and undistinguished, and\r\nin private conversation, where he observeth it as inviolably as if he\r\nwere in the greatest assembly, it is sometimes censured as formal. Two\r\nreasons are assigned for this behaviour: first, from the consciousness\r\nof his humble original,[12] he keepeth all familiarity at the utmost\r\ndistance, which otherwise might be apt to intrude; the second, that\r\nbeing sensible how subject he is to violent passions, he avoideth all\r\nincitements to them, by teaching those he converses with, from his own\r\nexample, to keep a great way within the bounds of decency and respect.\r\nAnd it is indeed true, that no man is more apt to take fire, upon the\r\nleast appearance of provocation; which temper he strives to subdue, with\r\nthe utmost violence upon himself: so that his breast has been seen to\r\nheave, and his eyes to sparkle with rage, in those very moments when his\r\nwords, and the cadence of his voice, were in the humblest and softest\r\nmanner: perhaps that force upon his nature may cause that insatiable\r\nlove of revenge, which his detractors lay to his charge, who\r\nconsequently reckon dissimulation among his chief perfections. Avarice\r\nhe hath none; and his ambition is gratified, by being the uncontested\r\nhead of his party. With an excellent understanding, adorned by all the\r\npolite parts of learning, he hath very little taste for conversation, to\r\nwhich he prefers the pleasure of reading and thinking; and in the\r\nintervals of his time amuseth himself with an illiterate chaplain, an\r\nhumble companion, or a favourite servant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See note on p. 29 of vol. i. of present edition. Swift's\r\n\"Dedication\" of \"A Tale of a Tub\" to Somers strikes a somewhat different\r\nnote from that of this \"character.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: His father, John Somers, was an attorney at law in the\r\ntown of Worcester. [S.]]\r\n\r\nThese are some few distinguishing marks in the character of that person,\r\nwho now presideth over the discontented party, although he be not\r\nanswerable for all their mistakes; and if his precepts had been more\r\nstrictly followed, perhaps their power would not have been so easily\r\nshaken. I have been assured, and heard him profess, that he was against\r\nengaging in that foolish prosecution of Dr. Sacheverell, as what he\r\nforesaw was likely to end in their ruin; that he blamed the rough\r\ndemeanour of some persons to the Queen, as a great failure in prudence;\r\nand that, when it appeared Her Majesty was firmly resolved upon a treaty\r\nof peace, he advised his friends not to oppose it in its progress, but\r\nfind fault with it after it was made; which would be a copy of the like\r\nusage themselves had met with, after the treaty of Ryswick;[13] and the\r\nsafest, as well as the most probable, way of disgracing the promoters\r\nand advisers. I have been the larger in representing to the reader some\r\nidea of this extraordinary genius, because, whatever attempt hath\r\nhitherto been made, with any appearance of conduct, or probability of\r\nsuccess, to restore the dominion of that party,[14] was infallibly\r\ncontrived by him; and I prophesy the same for the future, as long as his\r\nage and infirmities will leave him capable of business.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See note in vol. v., p. 67, of present edition, [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: P. Fitzgerald says \"faction.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Marlborough's character[15] hath been so variously drawn,\r\nand is indeed of so mixed a nature in itself, that it is hard to\r\npronounce on either side, without the suspicion of flattery or\r\ndetraction. I shall say nothing of his military accomplishments, which\r\nthe opposite reports, of his friends and enemies among the soldiers,\r\nhave rendered[26] problematical: but if he be among those who delight in\r\nwar, it is agreed to be not for the reasons common with other generals.\r\nThose maligners who deny him personal valour, seem not to consider that\r\nthis accusation is charged at a venture; since the person of a wise\r\ngeneral is too seldom exposed, to form any judgment in the matter: and\r\nthat fear, which is said to have sometimes[17] disconcerted him before\r\nan action, might probably be more for his army than for himself.[18] He\r\nwas bred in the height of what is called the Tory principle; and\r\ncontinued with a strong bias that way, till the other party had bid\r\nhigher for him than his friends could afford to give. His want of\r\nliterature is in some sort supplied by a good understanding, a degree of\r\nnatural elocution, and that knowledge of the world which is learned in\r\narmies and courts. We are not to take the height of his ambition from\r\nhis soliciting to be general for life:[19] I am persuaded his chief\r\nmotive was the pay and perquisites, by continuing the war; and that he\r\nhad _then_ no intentions of settling the crown in his family, his only\r\nson having been dead some years before.[20] He is noted to be master of\r\ngreat temper, able to govern or very well to disguise his passions,\r\nwhich are all melted down, or extinguished, in his love of wealth. That\r\nliberality which nature has denied him, with respect of money, he makes\r\nup by a great profusion of promises: but this perfection, so necessary\r\nin courts, is not very successful in camps among soldiers, who are not\r\nrefined enough to understand or to relish it.[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: For further remarks on Marlborough, see Swift's \"Conduct\r\nof the Allies,\" \"The Learned Comment on Dr. Hare's Sermon,\" and \"The\r\nExaminer.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: P.

[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHis wife, the Duchess, may justly challenge her place in this list. It\r\nis to her the Duke is chiefly indebted for his greatness and his fall;\r\nfor above twenty years she possessed, without a rival, the favours of\r\nthe most indulgent mistress in the world, nor ever missed one single\r\nopportunity that fell in her way of improving it to her own\r\nadvantage.[22] She hath preserved a tolerable court reputation, with\r\nrespect to love and gallantry;[23] but three Furies reigned in her\r\nbreast, the most mortal enemies of all softer passions, which were\r\nsordid Avarice, disdainful Pride, and ungovernable Rage; by the last of\r\nthese often breaking out in sallies of the most unpardonable sort, she\r\nhad long alienated her sovereign's mind, before it appeared to the\r\nworld.[24] This lady is not without some degree of wit, and hath in her\r\ntime affected the character of it, by the usual method of arguing\r\nagainst religion, and proving the doctrines of Christianity to be\r\nimpossible and absurd. Imagine what such a spirit, irritated by the loss\r\nof power, favour, and employment, is capable of acting or attempting;\r\nand then I have said enough.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: See the \"Account of the Conduct of the Duchess of\r\nMarlborough, in a Letter from Herself, to Lord ----,\" 8vo, 1742,\r\n_passim_.

Fitzgerald adds \"(to which, however, she hath been\r\nthought not entirely a stranger).\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: See note in vol. v., p. 368, of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe next in order to be mentioned is the Earl of Godolphin.[25] It is\r\nsaid, he was originally intended for a trade, before his friends\r\npreferred him to be a page at court; which some have very unjustly\r\nobjected as a reproach. He hath risen gradually in four reigns, and was\r\nmuch more constant to his second master King James than some others, who\r\nhad received much greater obligations; for he attended the abdicated\r\nKing to the sea-side, and kept constant correspondence with him till the\r\nday of his death. He always professed a sort of passion for the Queen at\r\nSt. Germain's; and his letters were to her in the style of what the\r\nFrench call _double entendre_. In a mixture of love and respect, he used\r\nfrequently to send her from hence little presents of those things which\r\nare agreeable to ladies, for which he always asked King William's leave,\r\nas if without her privity; because, if she had known that circumstance,\r\nit was to be supposed she would not accept them. Physiognomists would\r\nhardly discover, by consulting the aspect of this lord, that his\r\npredominant passions were love and play; that he could sometimes scratch\r\nout a song in praise of his mistress, with a pencil and card; or that he\r\nhath tears at command, like a woman, to be used either in an intrigue of\r\ngallantry or politics. His alliance with the Marlborough family, and his\r\npassion for the Duchess, were the cords which dragged him into a party,\r\nwhose principles he naturally disliked, and whose leaders he personally\r\nhated, as they did him. He became a thorough convert by a perfect\r\ntrifle; taking fire at a nickname[26] delivered by Dr. Sacheverell, with\r\ngreat indiscretion, from the pulpit, which he applied to himself: and\r\nthis is one among many instances given by his enemies, that magnanimity\r\nis none of his virtues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See note in vol. v., p. 68, of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Volpone. [ORIGINAL NOTE.]]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Sunderland[27] is another of that alliance. It seems to have\r\nbeen this gentleman's fortune, to have learned his divinity from his\r\nuncle,[28] and his politics from his tutor.[29] It may be thought a\r\nblemish in his character, that he hath much fallen from the height of\r\nthose republican[30] principles with which he began; for in his father's\r\nlifetime, while he was a Member of the House of Commons, he would often,\r\namong his familiar friends, refuse the title of Lord (as he hath done to\r\nmyself), swear he would never be called otherwise than Charles Spencer,\r\nand hoped to see the day when there should not be a peer in England. His\r\nunderstanding, at the best, is of the middling size; neither hath he\r\nmuch improved it, either in reality, or, which is very unfortunate, even\r\nin the opinion of the world, by an overgrown library.[31] It is hard to\r\ndecide, whether he learned that rough way of treating his sovereign from\r\nthe lady he is allied to,[32] or whether it be the result of his own\r\nnature. The sense of the injuries he hath done, renders him (as it is\r\nvery natural) implacable towards those to whom he hath given greatest\r\ncause to complain; for which reason he will never forgive either the\r\nQueen or the present treasurer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See note in vol. v., pp. 377-378 of present edition.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: John Digby, third earl of Bristol.

[N.]]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Wharton[33] hath filled the province allotted him by his\r\ncolleagues, with sufficiency equal to the ablest of them all. He hath\r\nimbibed his father's[34] principles in government; but dropped his\r\nreligion, and took up no other in its stead: excepting that\r\ncircumstance, he is a firm Presbyterian. He is perfectly skilled in all\r\nthe arts of managing at elections, as well as in large baits of pleasure\r\nfor making converts of young men of quality, upon their first\r\nappearance; in which public service he contracted such large debts, that\r\nhis brethren were forced, out of mere justice, to leave Ireland at his\r\nmercy, where he had only time to set himself right. Although the graver\r\nheads of his party think him too profligate and abandoned, yet they dare\r\nnot be ashamed of him; for, beside his talents above mentioned, he is\r\nvery useful in Parliament, being a ready speaker, and content to employ\r\nhis gift upon such occasions, where those who conceive they have any\r\nremainder of reputation or modesty are ashamed to appear. In short, he\r\nis an uncontestable instance to discover the true nature of faction;\r\nsince, being overrun with every quality which produceth contempt and\r\nhatred, in all other commerce of the world, he hath, notwithstanding,\r\nbeen able to make so considerable a figure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See also \"A Short Character,\" etc. in vol. v. and \"The\r\nExaminer,\" Nos. 18 and 23, in vol. ix. of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The Earl, his father, was a rigid Presbyterian. [ORIGINAL\r\nNOTE.]]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Cowper,[35] although his merits are later than the rest,\r\ndeserveth a rank in this great council. He was considerable in the\r\nstation of a practising lawyer; but, as he was raised to be a\r\nchancellor, and a peer, without passing through any of the intermediate\r\nsteps, which in late times hath been the constant practice, and little\r\nskilled[36] in the nature of government, or the true interests of\r\nprinces, further than the municipal or common law of England; his\r\nabilities, as to foreign affairs, did not equally appear in the council.\r\nSome former passages of his life were thought to disqualify him for that\r\noffice, by which he was to be the guardian of the Queen's\r\nconscience;[37] but these difficulties were easily overruled by the\r\nauthors of his promotion, who wanted a person that would be subservient\r\nto all their designs; wherein they were not disappointed. As to his\r\nother accomplishments, he was what we usually call a piece of a scholar,\r\nand a good logical reasoner; if this were not too often allayed, by a\r\nfallacious way of managing an argument, which made him apt to deceive\r\nthe unwary, and sometimes to deceive himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: See vol. v., p. 372 of present edition.

[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe last to be spoken of in this list is the Earl of Nottingham,[38] a\r\nconvert and acquisition to that party since their fall, to which he\r\ncontributed his assistance; I mean his words, and probably his wishes;\r\nfor he had always lived under the constant visible profession of\r\nprinciples, directly opposite to those of his new friends. His vehement\r\nand frequent speeches against admitting the Prince of Orange to the\r\nthrone are yet to be seen; and although a numerous family gave a\r\nspecious pretence to his love of power and money, for taking an\r\nemployment under that monarch, yet he was allowed to have always kept a\r\nreserve of allegiance to his exiled master; of which his friends produce\r\nseveral instances, and some while he was secretary of state to King\r\nWilliam. His outward regularity of life, his appearance of religion, and\r\nseeming zeal for the Church, as they are an effect, so they are the\r\nexcuse for that stiffness and formality with which his nature[39] is\r\nfraught. His adust complexion disposeth him to rigour[40] and severity,\r\nwhich his admirers palliate with the name of zeal. No man had ever a\r\nsincerer countenance, or more truly representing his mind and manners.\r\nHe hath some knowledge in the law, very amply sufficient to defend his\r\nproperty at least.[41] A facility of utterance, descended to him from\r\nhis father,[42] and improved by a few sprinklings of literature, hath\r\nbrought himself, and some few admirers, into an opinion of his\r\neloquence. He is every way inferior to his brother Guernsey,[43] but\r\nchiefly in those talents which he most values and pretends to; over\r\nwhom, nevertheless, he preserveth an ascendant.[44] His great ambition\r\nwas to be the head of those who were called the Church party; and,\r\nindeed, his grave solemn deportment and countenance, seconded by\r\nabundance of professions for their service, had given many of them an\r\nopinion of his veracity,[45] which he interpreted as their sense of his\r\njudgment and wisdom;[46] and this mistake lasted till the time of his\r\ndefection, of which it was partly the cause; but then it plainly\r\nappeared, that he had not credit to bring over one single proselyte, to\r\nkeep himself in countenance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: See notes in vol. v., pp. 246-248 of present edition.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: P.

As we have no traces of\r\nliberty now left but the freedom of the press, it is the most earnest\r\ndesire of your friends that you would strike out all that you have said\r\non that subject\" (Sir W. Scott's edit., vol. xix., pp. 133-136). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nDuring the dominion of the late men in power, addresses had been\r\nprocured from both Houses to the Queen, representing their opinion, that\r\nno peace could be secure for Britain, while Spain or the West Indies\r\nremained in the possession of the Bourbon family. But Her Majesty\r\nhaving, for reasons which have been often told to the world, and which\r\nwill not soon be forgotten, called a new Parliament, and chose a new set\r\nof servants, began to view things and persons in another light. She\r\nconsidered the necessities of her people, the distant prospect of a\r\npeace upon such an improbable condition, which was never mentioned or\r\nunderstood in the grand alliance; the unequal burthen she bore in the\r\nwar, by the practices of the allies upon the corruption of some whom she\r\nmost trusted, or perhaps by the practices of these upon the allies; and,\r\nlastly, by the changes which death had brought about in the Austrian and\r\nBourbon families. Upon all which motives she was prevailed upon to\r\nreceive some overtures from France, in behalf of herself and the whole\r\nconfederacy. The several steps of this negotiation, from its first rise\r\nto the time I am now writing, shall be related in another part of this\r\nHistory. Let it suffice for the present to say, that such proposals were\r\nreceived from France as were thought sufficient by our court whereupon\r\nto appoint time and place for a general treaty; and soon after the\r\nopening of the session, the Bishop[48] of Bristol, lord privy seal, was\r\ndispatched to Utrecht, where he and the Earl of Strafford were appointed\r\nplenipotentiaries for the Queen of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Dr. Robinson, afterwards Bishop of London. [ORIGINAL\r\nNOTE.]]\r\n\r\nThe managers of the discontented party, who, during the whole summer,\r\nhad observed the motions of the court running fast towards a peace,\r\nbegan to gather up all their forces, in order to oppose Her Majesty's\r\ndesigns, when the Parliament should meet. Their only strength was in the\r\nHouse of Lords, where the Queen had a very crazy majority, made up by\r\nthose whose hearts were in the other interest; but whose fears,\r\nexpectations, or immediate dependence, had hitherto kept them within\r\nbounds. There were two lords upon whose abilities and influence, of a\r\nvery different nature, the managers built their strongest hopes. The\r\nfirst was the Duke of Somerset, master of the horse. This duke, as well\r\nas his duchess, was in a good degree of favour with the Queen, upon the\r\nscore of some civilities and respects Her Majesty had received from\r\nthem, while she was princess.[49] For some years after the Revolution,\r\nhe never appeared at court, but was looked upon as a favourer of the\r\nabdicated family; and it was the late Earl of Rochester who first\r\npresented him to King William. However, since the time he came into\r\nemployment, which was towards the close of the last reign, he hath been\r\na constant zealous member of the other party; but never failed in either\r\nattendance or respect towards the Queen's person, or, at most, only\r\nthreatened sometimes, that he would serve no longer, while such or such\r\nmen were employed; which, as things went then, was not reckoned any\r\noffence at all against duty or good behaviour. He had been much caressed\r\nand flattered by the Lords of the Junto,[50] who sometimes went so far\r\nas to give him hopes of the crown, in reversion to his family, upon\r\nfailure of the house of Hanover. All this worked so far upon his\r\nimagination, that he affected to appear the head of their party, to\r\nwhich his talents were no way proportioned; for they soon grew weary of\r\nhis indigested schemes, and his imperious manner of obtruding them: they\r\nbegan to drop him at their meetings, or contradicted him, with little\r\nceremony, when he happened to be there, which his haughty nature[51] was\r\nnot able to brook. Thus a mortal quarrel was kindled between him and the\r\nwhole assembly of party leaders; so that, upon the Queen's first\r\nintentions of changing her ministry, soon after the trial of Dr.\r\nSacheverell, he appointed several meetings with Mr. Harley alone, in the\r\nmost private manner, in places and at times least liable to suspicion.\r\nHe employed all his credit with the Queen to drive on the removal of my\r\nLord Godolphin, and the rest; and, in the council, treated the small\r\nremainder, who continued some time longer in their places, with all\r\npossible marks of hatred or disdain. But when the question came for\r\ndissolving the Parliament, he stopped short: he had already satiated his\r\nresentments, which were not against things, but persons: he furiously\r\nopposed that counsel, and promised to undertake for the Parliament\r\nhimself. When the Queen had declared her pleasure for the dissolution,\r\nhe flew off in greater rage than ever; opposed the court in all\r\nelections, where he had influence or power; and made very humble[52]\r\nadvances to reconcile himself with the discarded lords, especially the\r\nEarl of Godolphin, who is reported to have treated him at Newmarket in a\r\nmost contemptuous manner. But the sincerity of his repentance, which\r\nappeared manifestly in the first session of the new Parliament, and the\r\nuse he might be of by his own remaining credit, or rather that of his\r\nduchess, with the Queen, at length begat a reconcilement. He still kept\r\nhis employment, and place in the cabinet council; but had never appeared\r\nthere, from an avowed dislike of all persons and proceedings. It\r\nhappened about the end of summer, one thousand seven hundred and eleven,\r\nat Windsor, when the cabinet council was summoned, this duke, whether by\r\ndirections from his teachers, or the instability of his nature, took a\r\nfancy to resume his place, and a chair was brought accordingly; upon\r\nwhich Mr. Secretary St. John refused to assist, and gave his reasons,\r\nthat he would never sit in council with a man who had so often betrayed\r\nthem, and was openly engaged with a faction which endeavoured to\r\nobstruct all Her Majesty's measures. Thus the council was put off to\r\nnext day, and the duke made no farther attempts to be there.[53] But,\r\nupon this incident, he declared open war against the ministry; and, from\r\nthat time to the session, employed himself in spiriting up several\r\ndepending lords to adhere to their friends, when an occasion should\r\noffer. The arguments he made use of, were, that those in power designed\r\nto make an ignominious and insecure peace, without consulting the\r\nallies; that this could be no otherwise prevented than by an address\r\nfrom the Lords, to signify their opinion, that no peace could be\r\nhonourable or secure, while Spain or the West Indies remained in any of\r\nthe Bourbon family:[54] upon which several farther resolutions and\r\ninquiries would naturally follow; that the differences between the two\r\nHouses, upon this point, must either be made up by the Commons agreeing\r\nwith the Lords, or must end in a dissolution, which would be followed by\r\na return of the old ministry, who, by the force of money and management,\r\ncould easily get another Parliament to their wishes. He farther assured\r\nthem boldly, that the Queen herself was at the bottom of this design,\r\nand had empowered him to desire their votes against the peace, as a\r\npoint that would be for her service; and therefore they need not be in\r\npain upon account of their pensions, or any farther marks of favour they\r\nexpected. Thus, by reviving the old art of using Her Majesty's authority\r\nagainst her person, he prevailed over some, who were not otherwise in a\r\nstation of life to oppose the crown; and his proselytes may pretend to\r\nsome share of pity, since he offered for an argument his own example,\r\nwho kept his place and favour, after all he had done to deserve the loss\r\nof both.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: In 1692, on a difference which the princess had with King\r\nWilliam and his Queen, occasioned by her warm attachment to the Duchess\r\nof Marlborough, she quitted The Cockpit, and accepted the Duke of\r\nSomerset's offer of Sion House for a temporary residence.

Scott's edit. vol. xix., pp. 133-136. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: It was Nottingham who moved this argument in the form of\r\nan amendment to the address on 7th December, 1711. See _infra_, and also\r\nvol. v., p. 444 of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe other lord, in whom the discontented managers placed much of their\r\nhopes, was the Earl of Nottingham, already mentioned; than whom no man\r\never appeared to hate them more, or to be more pleased at their fall,\r\npartly from his avowed principles, but chiefly from the hopes he had of\r\nsharing in their spoils. But it fell out, that he was no way acceptable\r\nto the Queen or her new servants: these apprehended no little trouble\r\nand impediment to the public business, from his restless, talkative,\r\noverweening manner, if once he was suffered to have any part in affairs;\r\nand he stood very ill with the court, having made a motion in the House\r\nof Lords, and in Her Majesty's presence, that the Electoral Prince of\r\nHanover might be invited to reside in England, although he had before\r\ndeclared to the Queen how much he was against that proposal, when it was\r\nfirst offered by the other party. However, some very considerable\r\nemployments had been given to his nearest relations, and he had one or\r\ntwo offers for himself, which he thought fit to refuse, as not equal to\r\nhis merits and character. Upon the Earl of Rochester's decease, he\r\nconceived that the crown would hardly overlook him for president of the\r\ncouncil, and deeply resented that disappointment. But the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, lord privy seal, dying some time after, he found that office\r\nwas first designed for the Earl of Jersey, and, upon this lord's sudden\r\ndeath, was actually disposed of to the Bishop of Bristol by which he\r\nplainly saw, that the Queen was determined against giving him any\r\nopportunity of directing in affairs, or displaying his eloquence in the\r\ncabinet council. He had now shaken off all remains of patience or\r\ntemper, and, from the contemplation of his own disappointments, fell, as\r\nit is natural, to find fault with the public management, and to assure\r\nhis neighbours in the country, that the nation was in imminent danger of\r\nbeing ruined. The discontented[55] lords were soon apprised of this\r\ngreat change, and the Duke of Roxburgh,[56] the earl's son-in-law, was\r\ndispatched to Burleigh on the Hill, to cultivate his present\r\ndispositions, and offer him whatever terms he pleased to insist on. The\r\nEarl immediately agreed to fall in with any measures for distressing or\r\ndestroying the ministry but, in order to preserve his reputation with\r\nthe Church party, and perhaps bring them over to his interests, he\r\nproposed, that a bill should be brought into the House of Lords for\r\npreventing occasional conformity, and be unanimously agreed to by all\r\nthe peers of the low-church[57] principle, which would convince the\r\nworld of their good intentions to the established religion,[58] and that\r\ntheir oppositions to the court wholly proceeded from their care of the\r\nnation, and concern for its honour and safety.[59]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: P. Fitzgerald says \"factious.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: John Ker, Earl of Roxburgh, was created Earl of Kelso,\r\nMarquess of Cessford and Beaumont, and Duke of Roxburgh in 1707.\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: P. Fitzgerald says \"Whig.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: P. Fitzgerald says \"established Church.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Nottingham succeeded in carrying the bill against\r\nOccasional Conformity on December 15th, 1711. See Swift's \"Letter to a\r\nWhig Lord,\" in vol. v. of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThese preparations were public enough, and the ministers had sufficient\r\ntime to arm themselves; but they seem to have acted, in this juncture,\r\nlike men who trusted to the goodness of their cause, and the general\r\ninclinations of the kingdom, rather than to those arts which our\r\ncorruptions have too often made necessary. Calculations were indeed\r\ntaken, by which it was computed, that there would be a majority of ten\r\nupon the side of the court. I remember to have told my Lord Harcourt and\r\nMr. Prior, that a majority of ten was only a majority of five, because\r\nif their adversaries could bring off five, the number would be equal:\r\nand so it happened to prove; for the mistake lay in counting upon the\r\nbare promises of those who were wholly in the interest of the old\r\nministry, and were only kept in awe by the fear of offending the crown,\r\nand losing their subsistence, wherein the Duke of Somerset had given\r\nthem full satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWith these dispositions of both parties, and fears and hopes of the\r\nevent, the Parliament met upon the seventh of December, one thousand\r\nseven hundred and eleven. The Queen's speech (excepting what related to\r\nsupplies) was chiefly taken up in telling both Houses what progress she\r\nhad made towards a general peace, and her hopes of bringing it to a\r\nspeedy conclusion. As soon as Her Majesty was withdrawn, the House of\r\nLords, in a committee, resolved upon an address of thanks; to which the\r\nEarl of Nottingham proposed an addition of the following clause.\r\n\r\n\"And we do beg leave to represent it to Your Majesty, as the humble\r\nopinion and advice of this House, that no peace can be safe or\r\nhonourable to Great Britain and Europe, if Spain and the West Indies are\r\nto be allotted to any branch of the house of Bourbon.\"\r\n\r\nHe was seconded by the Earl of Scarborough; and, after a debate of\r\nseveral hours, the question for the clause was carried, as I remember,\r\nby not above two voices.[60] The next day the House agreed with the\r\ncommittee. The depending lords, having taken fresh courage from their\r\nprincipals, and some who professed themselves very humble servants to\r\nthe present ministry, and enemies to the former, went along with the\r\nstream, pretending not to see the consequences that must visibly follow.\r\nThe address was presented on the eleventh, to which Her Majesty's answer\r\nwas short and dry. She distinguished their thanks from the rest of the\r\npiece; and, in return to Lord Nottingham's clause, said, She should be\r\nsorry that any body could think she would not do her utmost to recover\r\nSpain and the West Indies from the house of Bourbon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: The previous question in favour of the Earl of\r\nNottingham's amendment was carried by a single vote, the main question\r\nby a majority of no less than eight! [S.] But Bishop Burnet says \"by\r\nthree voices\" (\"Hist. Own Time,\" ii. 584), and Coxe says \"by a majority\r\nof 64 to 52.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nUpon the fifteenth of December the Earl of Nottingham likewise brought\r\nin the bill to prevent occasional conformity (although under a disguised\r\ntitle), which met with no opposition; but was swallowed by those very\r\nlords, who always appeared with the utmost violence against the least\r\nadvantage to the established Church.\r\n\r\nBut in the House of Commons there appeared a very different spirit; for\r\nwhen one Mr. Robert Walpole offered a clause of the same nature with\r\nthat of the Earl of Nottingham, it was rejected with contempt by a very\r\ngreat majority. Their address was in the most dutiful manner, approving\r\nof what Her Majesty had done towards a peace, and trusting entirely to\r\nher wisdom in the future management of it. This address was presented to\r\nthe Queen a day before that of the Lords, and received an answer\r\ndistinguishedly gracious. But the other party[61] was no ways\r\ndiscouraged by either answer, which they looked upon as only matter of\r\ncourse, and the sense of the ministry, contrary to that of the Queen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: P. Fitzgerald says \"faction.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe Parliament sat as long as the approaching festival would allow; and\r\nupon the twenty-second, the land-tax and occasional bills having\r\nreceived the royal assent, the House of Commons adjourned to the\r\nfourteenth of January following: but the adjournment of the Lords was\r\nonly to the second, the prevailing party there being in haste to pursue\r\nthe consequences of the Earl of Nottingham's clause, which they hoped\r\nwould end in the ruin of the treasurer, and overthrow the ministry; and\r\ntherefore took the advantage of this interval, that they might not be\r\ndisturbed by the Commons.\r\n\r\nWhen this address against any peace without Spain, &c. was carried in\r\nthe House of Lords, it is not easy to describe the effects it had upon\r\nmost men's passions. The partisans of the old ministry triumphed loudly,\r\nand without any reserve, as if the game were their own. The Earl of\r\nWharton was observed in the House to smile, and put his hands to his\r\nneck when any of the ministry was speaking, by which he would have it\r\nunderstood that some heads were in danger. Parker, the chief justice,\r\nbegan already with great zeal and officiousness to prosecute authors and\r\nprinters of weekly and other papers, writ in defence of the\r\nadministration: in short, joy and vengeance sat visible in every\r\ncountenance of that party.[62]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: See \"Journal to Stella,\" December 13th (vol. ii., p. 299\r\nof present edition). [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nOn the other side, all well-wishers to the Queen, the Church, or the\r\npeace, were equally dejected; and the treasurer stood the foremost mark\r\nboth of his enemies' fury, and the censure of his friends: among the\r\nlatter, some imputed this fatal miscarriage to his procrastinating\r\nnature; others, to his unmeasurable public thrift: both parties agreed,\r\nthat a first minister, with very moderate skill in affairs, might easily\r\nhave governed the event: and some began to doubt, whether the great fame\r\nof his abilities, acquired in other stations, were what he justly\r\ndeserved: all this he knew well enough, and heard it with great phlegm;\r\nneither did it make any alteration in his countenance or humour. He told\r\nMonsieur Buys, the Dutch envoy, two days before the Parliament sat, that\r\nhe was sorry for what was like to pass, because the States would be the\r\nfirst sufferers, which he desired the envoy to remember: and to his\r\nnearest friends, who appeared in pain about the public or themselves, he\r\nonly said that all would be well, and desired them not to be\r\nfrighted.[63]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: See Swift's account of an interview with the lord\r\ntreasurer in his \"Journal to Stella,\" December 8th (_ibid.,_ p. 296).\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nIt was, I conceive, upon these motives, that the treasurer advised Her\r\nMajesty to create twelve new lords,[64] and thereby disable the sting of\r\nfaction for the rest of her lifetime: this promotion was so ordered,\r\nthat a third part were of those on whom, or their posterity, the peerage\r\nwould naturally devolve; and the rest were such, whose merit, birth, and\r\nfortune, could admit of no exception.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: See note, vol. ii., p. 308, and note, vol. v., p. 446.\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe adverse party, being thus driven down by open force, had nothing\r\nleft but to complain, which they loudly did; that it was a\r\npernicious[65] example set for ill princes to follow, who, by the same\r\nrule, might make at any time an hundred as well as twelve, and by these\r\nmeans become masters of the House of Lords whenever they pleased, which\r\nwould be dangerous to our liberties. To this it was answered, that ill\r\nprinces seldom trouble themselves to look for precedents; that men of\r\ngreat estates will not be less fond of preserving their liberties when\r\nthey are created peers; that in such a government as this, where the\r\nPrince holds the balance between two great powers, the nobility and\r\npeople, it is the very nature of his office to remove from one scale\r\ninto the other, or sometimes put his own weight in the lightest, so as\r\nto bring both to an equilibrium; and lastly, that the other party had\r\nbeen above twenty years corrupting the nobility with republican\r\nprinciples, which nothing but the royal prerogative could hinder from\r\noverspreading us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: P. Fitzgerald says \"dangerous.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe conformity bill above mentioned was prepared by the Earl of\r\nNottingham before the Parliament met, and brought in at the same time\r\nwith the clause against peace, according to the bargain made between him\r\nand his new friends: this he hoped would not only save his credit with\r\nthe Church party, but bring them over to his politics, since they must\r\nneeds be convinced, that instead of changing his own principles, he had\r\nprevailed on the greatest enemies to the established religion to be the\r\nfirst movers in a law for the perpetual settlement of it. Here it was\r\nworth observing, with what resignation the Junto Lords (as they were\r\nthen called) were submitted to by their adherents and followers; for it\r\nis well known, that the chief among the dissenting teachers in town were\r\nconsulted upon this affair, and such arguments used, as had power to\r\nconvince them, that nothing could be of greater advantage to their cause\r\nthan the passing this bill. I did, indeed, see a letter at that time\r\nfrom one of them to a great[66] man, complaining, that they were\r\nbetrayed and undone by their pretended friends; but they were in general\r\nvery well satisfied upon promises that this law should soon be repealed,\r\nand others more in their favour enacted, as soon as their friends should\r\nbe re-established.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: It was to the Treasurer himself. [ORIGINAL NOTE.] Scott\r\nsays that it was written by Mr. Shower on December 20th, and that the\r\nwriter complained that the Dissenters had \"been shamefully abandoned,\r\nsold, and sacrificed, by their professed friends.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nBut nothing seemed more extraordinary than the event of this refined\r\nmanagement, by which the Earl of Nottingham was so far from bringing\r\nover proselytes (wherein his abilities fell very short even of the Duke\r\nof Somerset's); or preserving the reputation of a firm churchman, that\r\nvery few people did so much as imagine he had any such design; only when\r\nhe brought in the bill, they conceived it was some wonderful deep reach\r\nof politics, which they could not comprehend: however, they liked the\r\nthing, and without troubling themselves about the persons or motives\r\nfrom whence it rose, it had a very speedy passage through both Houses.\r\nIt must be confessed, that some attempt of this nature was much more\r\nnecessary to the leaders of that party, than is generally thought. The\r\ndesire of power and revenge was common to them all; but several among\r\nthem were also conscious that they stood in need of protection, whose\r\nsafety was therefore concerned in the design of ruining the ministry, as\r\nwell as their ambition. The Duke of Marlborough foresaw those\r\nexaminations, which were afterwards made into some parts of his\r\nmanagement, and was apprehensive of a great deal more; that the\r\nParliament would perhaps enquire into the particulars of the negotiation\r\nat The Hague in one thousand seven hundred and nine; for what ends, and\r\nby whose advice the propositions of peace from France were rejected:\r\nbesides, he dreaded lest that mysterious policy might be laid open to\r\nthe world, of desiring the Queen to constitute him general for life,\r\nwhich was a very tender point, and would admit of much proof. It is\r\ntrue, indeed, that whilst the Duke's affair was under the consideration\r\nof the House of Commons, one of his creatures[67] (whether by direction\r\nor otherwise) assured the Speaker, with a very serious countenance, that\r\nthe world was mistaken in censuring his lord upon this article; for it\r\nwas the Queen who pressed the Duke to accept that commission; and upon\r\nhis humble refusal conceived her first displeasure against him. How such\r\na defence would have passed, if it had been offered in form, is easier\r\nto be conceived, than how any person in his wits could have the\r\nconfidence to affirm it; which last it would indeed be hard to believe,\r\nif there were any room left for doubt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Craggs, father to the secretary. [ORIGINAL NOTE.]]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Godolphin wanted protection, notwithstanding the act of\r\ngeneral pardon, which had been procured by his credit, and was\r\nprincipally calculated for his own security. He knew that his long\r\nneglect of compelling the accomptants to pass their accompts, might be\r\npunished as a breach of trust. He had run the kingdom into immense\r\ndebts, by taking up stores for the navy upon a vast discount, without\r\nparliamentary security; for which he could be able to plead neither law\r\nnor necessity: and he had given way, at least, to some proceedings, not\r\nvery justifiable, in relation to remittances of money, whereby the\r\npublic had suffered considerable losses. The Barrier Treaty sat heavy\r\nupon the Lord Townshend's spirits, because if it should be laid before\r\nthe House of Commons, whoever negotiated that affair, might be subject\r\nto the most severe animadversions: and the Earl of Wharton's\r\nadministration in Ireland was looked upon as a sufficient ground to\r\nimpeach him, at least, for high crimes and misdemeanours.\r\n\r\nThe managers in Holland were sufficiently apprised of all this; and\r\nMonsieur Buys, their minister here, took care to cultivate that good\r\ncorrespondence between his masters and their English friends, which\r\nbecame two confederates, pursuing the same end.\r\n\r\nThis man[68] had been formerly employed in England from that republic,\r\nand understood a little of our language. His proficiency in learning has\r\nbeen such, as to furnish now and then a Latin quotation, of which he is\r\nas liberal as his stock will admit. His knowledge in government reaches\r\nno farther than that of his own country, by which he forms and\r\ncultivates matters of state for the rest of the world. His reasonings\r\nupon politics are with great profusion at all meetings; and he leaves\r\nthe company with entire satisfaction that he hath fully convinced them.\r\nHe is well provided with that inferior sort of cunning, which is the\r\ngrowth of his country, of a standard with the genius of the people, and\r\ncapable of being transferred into every condition of life among them,\r\nfrom the boor to the burgomaster. He came into England with\r\ninstructions, authorizing him to accommodate all differences between Her\r\nMajesty and the States; but having first advised with the confederate\r\nlords, he assured the ministry he had powers to hear their proposals,\r\nbut none to conclude: and having represented to his masters what had\r\nbeen told him by the adverse party, he prevailed with them to revoke his\r\npowers. He found the interest of those who withstood the court, would\r\nexactly fall in with the designs of the States, which were to carry on\r\nthe war as they could, at our expense, and to see themselves at the head\r\nof a treaty of peace, whenever they were disposed to apply to France, or\r\nto receive overtures from thence.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: P. Fitzgerald says \"gentleman.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69:  Erasmus Lewis, in the letter already cited, refers to\r\nBuys, and gives the opinion of the gentlemen who had read the \"History,\"\r\non this matter, as follows: \"They think the transactions with Mr. Buys\r\nmight have been represented in a more advantageous light, and more to\r\nthe honour of that administration; and, undoubtedly they would have been\r\nso by your pen, had you been master of all the facts.\" And yet the facts\r\nas related by Swift in this and the last book of this \"History\" are\r\nsubstantially the facts as disclosed in Bolingbroke's Political\r\nCorrespondence. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, upon many powerful reasons, was utterly averse from all\r\ncounsels which aimed at putting an end to the war, without delivering\r\nhim the whole dominion of Spain; nay, the Elector of Hanover himself,\r\nalthough presumptive heir to the crown of England, and obliged by all\r\nsorts of ties to cultivate Her Majesty's friendship, was so far deceived\r\nby misrepresentations from hence, that he seemed to suffer Monsieur\r\nBothmar, his envoy here, to print and publish a Memorial in English,\r\ndirectly disapproving all Her Majesty's proceedings; which Memorial, as\r\nappeareth by the style and manner of it, was all drawn up, or at least\r\ndigested, by some party pen on this side of the water.[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: See Swift's \"Some Free Thoughts upon the Present State of\r\nAffairs,\" and the note on p. 410 of vol. v. of present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nCautious writers, in order to avoid offence or danger, and to preserve\r\nthe respect even[71] due to foreign princes, do usually charge the wrong\r\nsteps in a court altogether upon the persons employed; but I should have\r\ntaken a securer method, and have been wholly silent in this point, if I\r\nhad not then conceived some hope, that his Electoral Highness might\r\npossibly have been a stranger[72] to the Memorial of his resident: for,\r\nfirst, the manner of delivering it to the secretary of state was out of\r\nall form, and almost as extraordinary as the thing itself. Monsieur\r\nBothmar having obtained an hour of Mr. Secretary St. John, talked much\r\nto him upon the subject of which that Memorial consists; and upon going\r\naway, desired he might leave a paper with the secretary, which he said\r\ncontained the substance of what he had been discoursing. This paper Mr.\r\nSt. John laid aside, among others of little consequence; and a few\r\ndays[73] saw a Memorial in print,[74] which he found upon comparing to\r\nbe the same with what Bothmar had left.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Edition of 1775 has \"ever due.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: P.

Before he left his\r\nship he asked a person who came to meet him, whether the new lords were\r\nmade, and what was their number? He was attended through the streets\r\nwith a mighty rabble of people to St. James's, where Mr. Secretary St.\r\nJohn introduced him to the Queen, who received him with great civility.\r\nHis arrival had been long expected, and the project of his journey had\r\nas long been formed here by the party leaders, in concert with Monsieur\r\nBuys, and Monsieur Bothmar, the Dutch and Hanover envoys. This prince\r\nbrought over credentials from the Emperor, with offers to continue the\r\nwar upon a new foot, very advantageous to Britain; part of which, by Her\r\nMajesty's commands, Mr. St. John soon after produced to the House of\r\nCommons; where they were rejected, not without some indignation, by a\r\ngreat majority. The Emperor's proposals, as far as they related to\r\nSpain, were communicated to the House in the words following.\r\n\r\n\"His Imperial Majesty judges, that forty thousand men will be sufficient\r\nfor this service, and that the whole expense of the war in Spain, may\r\namount to four millions of crowns, towards which His Imperial Majesty\r\noffers to make up the troops, which he has in that country, to thirty\r\nthousand men, and to take one million of crowns upon himself\".\r\n\r\nOn the other side the House of Commons voted a third part of those four\r\nmillions as a sufficient quota for Her Majesty toward that service, for\r\nit was supposed the Emperor ought to bear the greatest proportion in a\r\npoint that so nearly concerned him, or at least, that Britain\r\ncontributing one third, the other two might be paid by his Imperial\r\nMajesty and the States, as they could settle it between them.\r\n\r\nThe design of Prince Eugene's journey, was to raise a spirit in the\r\nParliament and people for continuing the war, for nothing was thought\r\nimpossible to a prince of such high reputation in arms, in great favour\r\nwith the Emperor, and empowered to make such proposals from his master,\r\nas the ministry durst not reject. It appeared by an intercepted letter\r\nfrom Count Gallas, (formerly the Emperor's envoy here) that the prince\r\nwas wholly left to his liberty of making what offers he pleased in the\r\nEmperor's name, for if the Parliament could once be brought to raise\r\nfunds, and the war go on, the ministry here must be under a necessity of\r\napplying and expending those funds, and the Emperor could afterwards\r\nfind twenty reasons and excuses, as he had hitherto done, for not\r\nfurnishing his quota; therefore Prince Eugene, for some time, kept\r\nhimself within generals, until being pressed to explain himself upon\r\nthat particular of the war in Spain, which the house of Austria\r\npretended to have most at heart, he made the offer above mentioned, as a\r\nmost extraordinary effort, and so it was, considering how little they\r\nhad ever done before, towards recovering that monarchy to themselves;\r\nbut shameful as these proposals were, few believed the Emperor would\r\nobserve them, or, indeed, that he ever intended to spare so many men, as\r\nwould make up an army of thirty thousand men, to be employed in Spain.\r\n\r\nPrince Eugene's visit to his friends in England continued longer than\r\nwas expected; he was every day entertained magnificently by persons of\r\nquality of both parties; he went frequently to the treasurer, and\r\nsometimes affected to do it in private; he visited the other ministers\r\nand great officers of the court, but on all occasions publicly owned the\r\ncharacter and appellation of a Whig; and in secret, held continual\r\nmeetings with the Duke of Marlborough, and the other discontented lords,\r\nwhere M. Bothmar usually assisted. It is the great ambition of this\r\nprince to be perpetually engaged in war, without considering the cause\r\nor consequence; and to see himself at the head of an army, where only he\r\ncan make any considerable figure. He is not without a natural tincture\r\nof that cruelty, sometimes charged upon the Italians; and being nursed\r\nin arms, hath so far extinguished pity and remorse, that he will at any\r\ntime sacrifice a thousand men's lives, to a caprice of glory or revenge.\r\nHe had conceived an incurable hatred for the treasurer, as the person\r\nwho principally opposed this insatiable passion for war; said he had\r\nhopes of others, but that the treasurer was _un méchant diable_, not to\r\nbe moved; therefore, since it was impossible for him or his friends to\r\ncompass their designs, while that minister continued at the head of\r\naffairs, he proposed an expedient, often practised by those of his\r\ncountry, that the treasurer (to use his own expression) should be taken\r\noff, _à la négligence_; that this might easily be done, and pass for an\r\neffect of chance, if it were preceded by encouraging some proper people\r\nto commit small riots in the night: and in several parts of the town, a\r\ncrew of obscure ruffians were accordingly employed about that time, who\r\nprobably exceeded their commission; and mixing themselves with those\r\ndisorderly people that often infest the streets at midnight, acted\r\ninhuman outrages on many persons, whom they cut and mangled in the face\r\nand arms, and other parts of the body, without any provocation; but an\r\neffectual stop was soon put to these enormities, which probably\r\nprevented the execution of the main design.[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Erasmus Lewis, Lord Oxford, and the others who read the\r\nMS., advised the elimination of this insinuation against Prince Eugene.\r\nThey thought there was truth in it, but \"a matter of so high a nature,\"\r\nas Lewis expressed it to Swift, \"ought not to be asserted without\r\nexhibiting  the proofs.\" The paragraph following the one in the text,\r\ncontaining the imputation, seems as if it had been written after Swift\r\nhad received Lewis's strictures. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI am very sensible, that such an imputation ought not to be charged upon\r\nany person whatsoever, upon slight grounds or doubtful surmises; and\r\nthat those who think I am able to produce no better, will judge this\r\npassage to be fitter for a libel than a history; but as the account was\r\ngiven by more than one person who was at the meeting, so it was\r\nconfirmed past all contradiction by several intercepted letters and\r\npapers: and it is most certain, that the rage of the defeated party,\r\nupon their frequent disappointments, was so far inflamed, as to make\r\nthem capable of some counsels yet more violent and desperate than this,\r\nwhich, however, by the vigilance of those near the person of Her\r\nMajesty, were happily prevented.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth day of December, one thousand seven hundred and eleven,\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough was removed from all his employments: the Duke\r\nof Ormonde succeeding him as general, both here and in Flanders. This\r\nproceeding of the court (as far as it related to the Duke of\r\nMarlborough) was much censured both at home and abroad, and by some who\r\ndid not wish ill to the present situation of affairs. There were few\r\nexamples of a commander being disgraced, after an uninterrupted course\r\nof success for many years against a formidable enemy, and this before a\r\nperiod was put to the war: those who had least esteem for his valour and\r\nconduct, thought it not prudent to remove a general, whose troops were\r\nperpetually victorious, while he was at their head; because this had\r\ninfused into his soldiers an opinion that they should always conquer,\r\nand into the enemy that they should always be beaten; than which,\r\nnothing is to be held of greater moment, either in the progress of a\r\nwar, or upon the day of battle; and I have good grounds to affirm, that\r\nthese reasons had sufficient weight with the Queen and ministry to have\r\nkept the Duke of Marlborough in his post, if a way could have been found\r\nout to have done it with any assurance of safety to the nation. It is\r\nthe misfortune of princes, that the effects of their displeasure make\r\nusually much more noise than the causes: thus, the sound of the Duke's\r\nfall was heard farther than many of the reasons which made it necessary;\r\nwhereof, though some were visible enough, yet others lay more in the\r\ndark. Upon the Duke's last return from Flanders, he had fixed his\r\narrival to town (whether by accident or otherwise) upon the seventeenth\r\nof November, called Queen Elizabeth's day, when great numbers of his\r\ncreatures and admirers had thought fit to revive an old ceremony among\r\nthe rabble, of burning the Pope in effigy; for the performance of which,\r\nwith more solemnity, they had made extraordinary preparations.[76] From\r\nthe several circumstances of the expense of this intended pageantry, and\r\nof the persons who promoted it, the court, apprehensive of a design to\r\ninflame the common people, thought fit to order, that the several\r\nfigures should be seized as popish trinkets; and guards were ordered to\r\npatrol, for preventing any tumultuous assemblies. Whether this frolic\r\nwere only intended for an affront to the court, or whether it had a\r\ndeeper meaning, I must leave undetermined. The Duke, in his own nature,\r\nis not much turned to be popular; and in his flourishing times, whenever\r\nhe came back to England upon the close of a campaign, he rather affected\r\nto avoid any concourse of the _mobile_, if they had been disposed to\r\nattend him; therefore, so very contrary a proceeding at this juncture,\r\nmade it suspected as if he had a design to have placed himself at their\r\nhead. \"France,\" \"Popery,\" \"The Pretender,\" \"Peace without Spain,\" were\r\nthe words to be given about at this mock parade; and if what was\r\nconfidently asserted be true, that a report was to have been spread at\r\nthe same time of the Queen's death, no man can tell what might have been\r\nthe event.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: See Swift's \"Journal to Stella,\" Letter xxxv. (vol. ii.,\r\npp. 283-84), and \"A True Relation of the Intended Riot,\" printed in\r\nScott's edition, vol. v., pp. 399-413. [W.S.J.]\r\n\r\n\"The burning of a Pope in effigy,\" notes Scott--in his reprint of what\r\nSwift called \"the Grub Street account of the tumult\"--\"upon the 17th\r\nNovember, the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation, was a\r\nfavourite pastime with the mob of London, and often employed by their\r\nsuperiors as a means of working upon their passions and prejudices.\" A\r\nfull account of this ceremony is given in his edition of Dryden's Works,\r\n1808, vol. vi., p. 222. An account of the attempt \"to revive an old\r\nceremony,\" referred to by Swift, was published also in \"The Post Boy\"\r\nfor November 20th, 1711. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut this attempt, to whatever purposes intended, proving wholly abortive\r\nby the vigilance of those in power, the Duke's arrival was without any\r\nnoise or consequence; and upon consulting with his friends, he soon fell\r\nin with their new scheme for preventing the peace. It was believed by\r\nmany persons, that the ministers might, with little difficulty, have\r\nbrought him over, if they had pleased to make a trial; for as he would\r\nprobably have accepted any terms to continue in a station of such\r\nprodigious[77] profit, so there was sufficient room to work upon his\r\nfears, of which he is seldom unprovided[78] (I mean only in his\r\npolitical capacity) and his infirmity very much increased by his\r\nunmeasurable possessions, which have rendered him, _ipsique[79] onerique\r\ntimentem;_ but reason, as well as the event, proved this to be a\r\nmistake: for the ministers being determined to bring the war to as\r\nspeedy an issue as the honour and safety of their country would permit,\r\ncould not possibly recompense the Duke for the mighty incomes he held by\r\nthe continuance of it. Then the other party had calculated their\r\nnumbers; and by the accession of the Earl of Nottingham, whose example\r\nthey hoped would have many followers, and the successful solicitations\r\nof the Duke of Somerset, found they were sure of a majority in the House\r\nof Lords: so that in this view of circumstances, the Duke of Marlborough\r\nthought he acted with security, as well as advantage: he therefore\r\nboldly fell, with his whole weight, into the design of ruining the\r\nministry, at the expense of his duty to his sovereign, and the welfare\r\nof his country, after the mighty obligations he had received from both.\r\nWHIG and TORY were now no longer the dispute, but THE QUEEN or THE DUKE\r\nOF MARLBOROUGH: He was at the head of all the cabals and consults with\r\nBothmar, Buys, and the discontented lords. He forgot that government of\r\nhis passion, for which his admirers used to celebrate him, fell into all\r\nthe impotencies of anger and violence upon every party debate: so that\r\nthe Queen found herself under a necessity, either on the one side to\r\nsacrifice those friends, who had ventured their lives in rescuing her\r\nout of the power of some, whose former treatment she had little reason\r\nto be fond of, to put an end[80] to the progress she had made towards a\r\npeace, and dissolve her Parliament; or, on the other side, by removing\r\none person from so great a trust, to get clear of all her difficulties\r\nat once: Her Majesty therefore determined upon the latter, as the\r\nshorter and safer course; and during the recess at Christmas, sent the\r\nDuke a letter, to tell him she had no farther occasion for his\r\nservice.[81]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: P. Fitzgerald says \"immense.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: P. Fitzgerald adds \"being in his nature the most timorous\r\nperson alive.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: P.

[N.]]\r\n\r\nThere hath not perhaps in the present age been a clearer instance to\r\nshew the instability of greatness which is not founded upon virtue; and\r\nit may be an instruction to princes, who are well in the hearts of their\r\npeople, that the overgrown power of any particular person, although\r\nsupported by exorbitant wealth, can by a little resolution be reduced in\r\na moment, without any dangerous consequences. This lord, who was, beyond\r\nall comparison, the greatest subject in Christendom, found his power,\r\ncredit, and influence, crumble away on a sudden; and, except a few\r\nfriends or followers, by inclination, the rest dropped off in course.\r\nFrom directing in some manner the affairs of Europe, he descended to be\r\na member of a faction, and with little distinction even there: that\r\nvirtue of subduing his resentments, for which he was so famed when he\r\nhad little or no occasion to exert it, having now wholly forsaken him\r\nwhen he stood most in need of its assistance; and upon trial was found\r\nunable to bear a reverse of fortune, giving way to rage, impatience,\r\nenvy, and discontent.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****       *****       *****       *****       *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE FOUR LAST\r\n\r\nYEARS OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords met upon the second day of January, according to\r\ntheir adjournment; but before they could proceed to business, the twelve\r\nnew-created peers were, in the usual form, admitted to their seats in\r\nthat assembly, who, by their numbers, turned the balance on the side of\r\nthe court, and voted an adjournment to the same day with the Commons.\r\nUpon the fourteenth of January the two Houses met; but the Queen, who\r\nintended to be there in person, sent a message to inform them, that she\r\nwas prevented by a sudden return of the gout, and to desire they would\r\nadjourn for three days longer, when Her Majesty hoped she should be able\r\nto speak to them. However, her indisposition still continuing, Mr.\r\nSecretary St. John brought another message to the House of Commons from\r\nthe Queen, containing the substance of what she intended to have spoken;\r\n\"That she could now tell them, her plenipotentiaries were arrived at\r\nUtrecht; had begun, in pursuance of her instructions, to concert the\r\nmost proper ways of procuring a just satisfaction to all powers in\r\nalliance with her, according to their several treaties, and particularly\r\nwith relation to Spain and the West Indies; that she promised to\r\ncommunicate to them the conditions of peace, before the same should be\r\nconcluded; that the world would now see how groundless those reports\r\nwere, and without the least colour, that a separate peace had been\r\ntreated; that her ministers were directed to propose, that a day might\r\nbe fixed for the finishing, as was done for the commencement of this\r\ntreaty; and that, in the mean time, all preparations were hastening for\r\nan early campaign,\" etc.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's endeavours towards this great work having been in such a\r\nforwardness at the time that her message was sent, I shall here, as in\r\nthe most proper place, relate the several steps by which the intercourse\r\nbetween the courts of France and Britain was begun and carried on.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Torcy,[1] sent by the Most Christian King to The Hague,\r\nhad there, in the year one thousand seven hundred and nine, made very\r\nadvantageous offers to the allies, in his master's name; which our\r\nministers, as well as those of the States, thought fit to refuse, and\r\nadvanced other proposals in their stead, but of such a nature as no\r\nprince could digest, who did not lie at the immediate mercy of his\r\nenemies. It was demanded, among other things, \"That the French King\r\nshould employ his own troops, in conjunction with those of the allies,\r\nto drive his grandson out of Spain.\" The proposers knew very well, that\r\nthe enemy would never consent to this; and if it were possible they\r\ncould at first have any such hopes, Mons. de Torcy assured them to the\r\ncontrary, in a manner which might well be believed; for then the British\r\nand Dutch plenipotentiaries were drawing up their demands. They desired\r\nthat minister to assist them in the style and expression; which he very\r\nreadily did, and made use of the strongest words he could find to please\r\nthem. He then insisted to know their last resolution, whether these were\r\nthe lowest terms the allies would accept; and having received a\r\ndeterminate answer in the affirmative, he spoke to this effect:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Jean Baptiste Colbert (1665-1746), Marquis de Torcy, was\r\nnephew of the celebrated Colbert. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\"That he thanked them heartily for giving him the happiest day he had\r\never seen in his life: that, in perfect obedience to his master, he had\r\nmade concessions, in his own opinion, highly derogatory to the King's\r\nhonour and interest: that he had not concealed the difficulties of his\r\ncourt, or the discontents of his country, by a long and unsuccessful\r\nwar, which could only justify the large offers he had been empowered to\r\nmake: that the conditions of peace, now delivered into his hands by the\r\nallies, would raise a new spirit in the nation, and remove the greatest\r\ndifficulty the court lay under, putting it in his master's power to\r\nconvince all his subjects how earnestly His Majesty desired to ease them\r\nfrom the burthen of the war; but that his enemies would not accept of\r\nany terms, which could consist either with their safety or his honour.\"\r\nMons. Torcy assured the pensionary, in the strongest manner, and bid him\r\ncount upon it, that the King his master would never sign those articles.\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared, that the Marquis de Torcy's predictions were true; for\r\nupon delivering to his master the last resolutions of the allies, that\r\nPrince took care to publish them all over his kingdom, as an appeal to\r\nhis subjects against the unreasonableness and injustice of his enemies:\r\nwhich proceeding effectually answered the utmost he intended by it; for\r\nthe French nation, extremely jealous of their monarch's glory, made\r\nuniversal offers of their lives and fortunes, rather than submit to such\r\nignominious terms; and the clergy, in particular, promised to give the\r\nKing their consecrated plate, towards continuing the war. Thus that\r\nmighty kingdom, generally thought to be wholly exhausted of its wealth,\r\nyet, when driven to a necessity by the imprudence of the allies, or by\r\nthe corruption of particular men, who influenced their councils,\r\nrecovered strength enough to support itself for three following\r\ncampaigns: and in the last, by the fatal blindness or obstinacy of the\r\nDutch (venturing to act without the assistance of Britain, which they\r\nhad shamefully abandoned), was an overmatch for the whole confederate\r\narmy.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Alluding to the defeat at Denain (July 24th, 1712). [S.]]\r\n\r\nThose who, in order to defend the proceedings of the allies, have given\r\nan account of this negotiation, do wholly omit the circumstance I have\r\nnow related, and express the zeal of the British and Dutch ministers for\r\na peace, by informing us how frequently they sent after Mons. de Torcy,\r\nand Mons. Rouille, for a farther conference. But in the mean time, Mr.\r\nHoratio Walpole, secretary to the Queen's plenipotentiaries, was\r\ndispatched over hither, to have those abortive articles signed and\r\nratified by Her Majesty at a venture, which was accordingly done. A\r\npiece of management altogether absurd, and without example; contrived\r\nonly to deceive our people into a belief that a peace was intended, and\r\nto shew what great things the ministry designed to do.\r\n\r\nBut this hope expiring, upon the news that France had refused to sign\r\nthose articles, all was solved by recourse to the old topic of the\r\nFrench perfidiousness. We loaded them plentifully with ignominious\r\nappellations; \"they were a nation never to be trusted.\" The Parliament\r\ncheerfully continued their supplies, and the war went on. The winter\r\nfollowing began the second and last session of the preceding Parliament,\r\nnoted for the trial of Dr. Sacheverell, and the occasions thereby given\r\nto the people to discover and exert their dispositions, very opposite to\r\nthe designs of those who were then in power. In the summer of one\r\nthousand seven hundred and ten, ensued a gradual change of the ministry;\r\nand in the beginning of that winter the present Parliament was called.\r\n\r\nThe King of France, whose real interests made him sincerely desirous of\r\nany tolerable peace, found it impossible to treat upon equal conditions\r\nwith either of the two maritime powers engaged against him, because of\r\nthe prevalency of factions in both, who acted in concert to their mutual\r\nprivate advantage, although directly against the general dispositions of\r\nthe people in either, as well as against their several maxims of\r\ngovernment. But upon the great turn of affairs and councils here in\r\nEngland, the new Parliament and ministers acting from other motives, and\r\nupon other principles, that Prince hoped an opportunity might arise of\r\nresuming his endeavours towards a peace.\r\n\r\nThere was at this time in England a French ecclesiastic, called the Abbé\r\nGaultier,[3] who had resided several years in London, under the\r\nprotection of some foreign ministers, in whose families he used, upon\r\noccasion, to exercise his function of a priest. After the battle of\r\nBlenheim, this gentleman went down to Nottingham, where several French\r\nprisoners of quality were kept, to whom he rendered those offices of\r\ncivility suitable to persons in their condition, which, upon their\r\nreturn to France, they reported to his advantage. Among the rest, the\r\nChevalier de Croissy told his brother, the Marquis de Torcy, that\r\nwhenever the French court would have a mind to make overtures of peace\r\nwith England, Mons. Gaultier might be very usefully employed in handing\r\nthem to the ministers here. This was no farther thought on at present.\r\nIn the mean time the war went on, and the conferences at The Hague and\r\nGertruydenberg miscarried, by the allies insisting upon such demands as\r\nthey neither expected, nor perhaps desired, should be granted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See note prefixed to \"A New Journey to Paris\" in vol. v. of\r\npresent edition. Gaultier, although a priest, was nothing more than a\r\nsuperior spy in the pay of the French Court. He had been chaplain to\r\nTallard and the disgraced Count Gallas, and was a sort of _protégé_ of\r\nthe Earl of Jersey; but his character does not bear very close scrutiny.\r\nThe Duke of Berwick could not have had any high opinion either of the\r\nman or his abilities, since in the \"Mémoires de Berwick\" (vol. ii., p.\r\n122, edit. 1780) he is thus referred to: \"Sa naissance étoit toute des\r\nplus ordinaires, et ses facultés à l'avenant, c'est à dire, très\r\npauvre.\" St. John called Gaultier his \"Mercury,\" and De Torcy styled him\r\n\"the Angel of Peace\" (Torcy's \"Memoires,\" vol. ii., p. 148, edition of\r\n1828). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nSome time in July, one thousand seven hundred and ten, Mons. Gaultier\r\nreceived a letter from the Marquis de Torcy, signifying, that a report\r\nbeing spread of Her Majesty's intentions to change her ministry, to take\r\nMr. Harley into her councils, and to dissolve her Parliament, the Most\r\nChristian King thought it might be now a favourable conjuncture to offer\r\nnew proposals of a treaty: Mons. Gaultier was therefore directed to\r\napply himself, in the Marquis's name, either to the Duke of Shrewsbury,\r\nthe Earl of Jersey, or Mr. Harley, and inform the French court how such\r\na proposition would be relished. Gaultier chose to deliver his message\r\nto the second of those, who had been ambassador from the late king to\r\nFrance; but the Earl excused himself from entering into particulars with\r\na stranger, and a private person, who had no authority for what he said,\r\nmore than a letter from Mons. de Torcy. Gaultier offered to procure\r\nanother from that minister to the Earl himself; and did so, in a month\r\nafter: but obtained no answer till December following, when the Queen\r\nhad made all necessary changes, and summoned a free Parliament to her\r\nwishes. About the beginning of January, the abbé (after having procured\r\nhis dismission from Count Gallas, the emperor's envoy, at that time his\r\nprotector) was sent to Paris, to inform Mons. Torcy, that Her Majesty\r\nwould be willing his master should resume the treaty with Holland,\r\nprovided the demands of England might be previously granted. Gaultier\r\ncame back, after a short stay, with a return to his message, that the\r\nDutch had used the Most Christian King and his ministers in such a\r\nmanner, both at The Hague and Gertruydenberg, as made that Prince\r\nresolve not to expose himself any more to the like treatment; that he\r\ntherefore chose to address himself to England, and was ready to make\r\nwhatever offers Her Majesty could reasonably expect, for the advantage\r\nof her own kingdoms, and the satisfaction of her allies.\r\n\r\nAfter this message had been duly considered by the Queen and her\r\nministers, Mons. Gaultier was dispatched a second time to France, about\r\nthe beginning of March, one thousand seven hundred and ten-eleven, with\r\nan answer to the following purpose: \"That since France had their\r\nparticular reasons for not beginning again to treat with Holland,\r\nEngland was willing to remove that difficulty, and proposed it should be\r\ndone in this manner: That France should send over hither the\r\npropositions for a treaty, which should be transmitted by England to\r\nHolland, to be jointly treated on that side of the water; but it was to\r\nbe understood, that the same proposition formerly offered to Holland,\r\nwas to be made to England, or one not less advantageous to the allies;\r\nfor although England would enter most sincerely into such a treaty, and\r\nshew, in the course of it, the clearness of their intentions; yet they\r\ncould not, with honour, entertain a less beneficial proposal than what\r\nwas offered to the States.\"\r\n\r\nThat Prince, as well as his minister, Mons. de Torcy, either felt, or\r\naffected, so much resentment of the usage the latter had met at The\r\nHague and Gertruydenberg, that they appeared fully determined against\r\nmaking any application to the States, where the same persons continued\r\nstill in power, of whose treatment they so heavily complained.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: There can be little doubt that De Torcy's resentment\r\nagainst the Dutch, as expressed in the first of the propositions above\r\ncited, was an affected one, since it is well known that the Dutch were,\r\nat the very time these propositions were sent to England, and even for\r\nsome time previously, engaged in separate overtures with the French\r\nCourt. Indeed, according to Prior (\"History of his Own Time\"), they had\r\nbeen so engaged ever since the breaking up of the Gertruydenberg\r\nConference; and when Prior arrived in France in August, 1711, he was\r\nshown three letters written as from the Pensionary, but probably by\r\nPetecum, promising Louis every advantage if the Conference so unhappily\r\nbroken off at Gertruydenberg were renewed. \"The negotiations must be\r\nsecret and separate,\" reported Prior, \"His Most Christian Majesty need\r\nonly name his own terms.\" Swift knew of the existence of at least one of\r\nthese letters, because he was very anxious to obtain it \"to get some\r\nparticulars for my History,\" as he notes in his \"Journal,\" \"one letter\r\nof Petecum's showing the roguery of the Dutch.\" See also \"Portland\r\nManuscripts,\" vol. v., p. 34 _et seq_. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThey seemed altogether to distrust the inclination of that republic\r\ntowards a peace; but at the same time shewed a mighty complaisance to\r\nthe English nation, and a desire to have Her Majesty at the head of a\r\ntreaty. This appears by the first overture in form sent from that\r\nkingdom, and signed by Mons. de Torcy, on the twenty-second of April,\r\nN.S. one thousand seven hundred and eleven, to the following effect:\r\n\r\n\"That as it could not be doubted but the King was in a condition of\r\ncontinuing the war with honour, so it could not be looked on as a mark\r\nof weakness in His Majesty to break the silence he had kept since the\r\nconferences at Gertruydenberg; and that, before the opening of the\r\ncampaign, he now gives farther proof of the desire he always had to\r\nprocure the repose of Europe. But after what he hath found, by\r\nexperience, of the sentiments of those persons who now govern the\r\nrepublic of Holland, and of their industry in rendering all negotiations\r\nwithout effect, His Majesty will, for the public good, offer to the\r\nEnglish nation those propositions, which he thinks fit to make for\r\nterminating the war, and for settling the tranquillity of Europe upon a\r\nsolid foundation. It is with this view that he offers to enter into a\r\ntreaty of peace, founded on the following conditions.\r\n\r\n\"First, The English nation shall have real securities for carrying on\r\ntheir trade in Spain, the Indies, and ports of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, The King will consent to form a sufficient barrier in the Low\r\nCountries, for the security of the republic of Holland; and this barrier\r\nshall be such as England shall agree upon and approve; His Majesty\r\npromising, at the same time, an entire liberty and security to the trade\r\nof the Dutch.\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, All reasonable methods shall be thought on, with sincerity and\r\ntruth, for giving satisfaction to the allies of England and Holland.\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly, Whereas the affairs of the King of Spain are in so good a\r\ncondition as to furnish new expedients for putting an end to the\r\ndisputes about that monarchy, and for settling it to the satisfaction of\r\nthe several parties concerned, all sincere endeavours shall be used for\r\nsurmounting the difficulties arisen upon this occasion; and the trade\r\nand interest of all parties engaged in the present war shall be secured.\r\n\r\n\"Fifthly, The conferences, in order to treat of a peace upon these\r\nconditions, shall be immediately opened; and the plenipotentiaries, whom\r\nthe King shall name to assist thereat, shall treat with those of England\r\nand Holland, either alone, or in conjunction with those of their allies,\r\nas England shall choose.\r\n\r\n\"Sixthly, His Majesty proposes the towns of Aix la Chapelle or Liège,\r\nfor the place where the plenipotentiaries shall assemble, leaving the\r\nchoice likewise to England of either of the said towns, wherein to treat\r\na general peace.\"\r\n\r\nThese overtures, although expressing much confidence in the ministry\r\nhere, great deference to the Queen, and displeasure against the Dutch,\r\nwere immediately transmitted by Her Majesty's command to her ambassador\r\nin Holland, with orders, that they should be communicated to the\r\npensionary. The Abbé Gaultier was desired to signify this proceeding to\r\nthe Marquis de Torcy; at the same time to let that minister understand,\r\nthat some of the above articles ought to be explained. The Lord Raby,\r\nnow Earl of Stafford, was directed to tell the Pensionary, that Her\r\nMajesty being resolved, in making peace as in making war, to act in\r\nperfect concert with the States, would not lose a moment in transmitting\r\nto him a paper of this importance: that the Queen earnestly desired,\r\nthat the secret might be kept among as few as possible; and that she\r\nhoped the Pensionary would advise upon this occasion with no person\r\nwhatsoever, except such, as by the constitution of that government, are\r\nunavoidably necessary: that the terms of the several propositions were\r\nindeed too general; but, however, they contained an offer to treat: and\r\nthat, although there appeared an air of complaisance to England through\r\nthe whole paper, and the contrary to Holland, yet this could have no ill\r\nconsequences, as long as the Queen and the States took care to\r\nunderstand each other, and to act with as little reserve as became two\r\npowers, so nearly allied in interest; which rule, on the part of\r\nBritain, should be inviolably observed. It was signified likewise to the\r\nPensionary, that the Duke of Marlborough had no communication of this\r\naffair from England, and that it was supposed he would have none from\r\nThe Hague.\r\n\r\nAfter these proposals had been considered in Holland, the ambassador was\r\ndirected to send back the opinion of the Dutch ministers upon them. The\r\ncourt here was, indeed, apprehensive, that the Pensionary would be\r\nalarmed at the whole frame of Monsieur de Torcy's paper, and\r\nparticularly at these expressions, \"That the English shall have real\r\nsecurities for their trade, &c.\" and \"that the barrier for the\r\nStates-General shall be such as England shall agree upon and approve.\"\r\nIt was natural to think, that the fear which the Dutch would conceive of\r\nour obtaining advantageous terms for Britain, might put them upon trying\r\nunderhand for themselves, and endeavouring to overreach us in the\r\nmanagement of the peace, as they had hitherto done in that of the war:\r\nthe ambassador was therefore cautioned to be very watchful in\r\ndiscovering any workings, which might tend that way.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord Raby was first sent to The Hague, the Duke of Marlborough,\r\nand Lord Townshend, had, for very obvious reasons, used their utmost\r\nendeavours to involve him in as many difficulties as they could; upon\r\nwhich, and other accounts, needless to mention, it was thought proper,\r\nthat his Grace, then in Flanders, should not be let into the secret of\r\nthis affair.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of Aix or Liège for a place of treaty, was only a farther\r\nmark of their old discontent against Holland, to shew they would not\r\nname any town which belonged to the States.\r\n\r\nThe Pensionary having consulted those who had been formerly employed in\r\nthe negotiations of peace, and enjoined them the utmost secrecy, to\r\navoid the jealousy of the foreign ministers there, desired the\r\nambassador to return Her Majesty thanks, for the obliging manner of\r\ncommunicating the French overtures, for the confidence she placed in the\r\nStates, and for her promise of making no step towards a peace, but in\r\nconcert with them, assuring her of the like on their part: that although\r\nthe States endeavoured to hide it from the enemy, they were as weary of\r\nthe war as we, and very heartily desirous of a good and lasting peace,\r\nas well as ready to join in any method, by which Her Majesty should\r\nthink proper to obtain it: that the States looked upon these\r\npropositions as very dark and general; and they observed how the enemy\r\nwould create jealousies between the Queen, their republic, and the other\r\nallies; but they were satisfied it would have no effect, and relied\r\nentirely on the justness and prudence of Her Majesty, who they doubted\r\nnot, would make the French explain themselves more particularly in the\r\nseveral points of their proposals, and send a plan of the particular\r\nconditions whereupon they would make a peace: after which, the States\r\nwould be ready, either to join with Her Majesty, or to make their\r\nobjections, and were prepared to bring with them all the facility\r\nimaginable, towards promoting so good a work.\r\n\r\nThis is the sum of the verbal answer made by the Pensionary, upon\r\ncommunicating to him the French proposals; and I have chosen to set it\r\ndown, rather than transcribe the other given to the ambassador some days\r\nafter, which was more in form, and to the same purpose, but shorter, and\r\nin my opinion not so well discovering the true disposition of the Dutch\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nFor after the Queen had transmitted the French overtures to Holland, and\r\nthe States found Her Majesty was bent in earnest upon the thoughts of a\r\npeace, they began to cast about how to get the negotiation into their\r\nown hands. They knew that whatever power received the first proposals,\r\nwould be wise enough to stipulate something for themselves, as they had\r\ndone in their own case, both at The Hague and Gertruydenberg, where they\r\ncarved as they pleased, without any regard to the interests of their\r\nnearest allies. For this reason, while they endeavoured to amuse the\r\nBritish court with expostulations upon the several preliminaries sent\r\nfrom France, Monsieur Petecum, a forward meddling agent of Holstein, who\r\nhad resided some years in Holland, negotiated with Heinsius, the Grand\r\nPensionary, as well as with Vanderdussen and Buys, about restoring the\r\nconferences between France and that republic, broke off in\r\nGertruydenberg. Pursuant to which, about the end of May, N.S. one\r\nthousand seven hundred and eleven, Petecum wrote to the Marquis de\r\nTorcy, with the privity of the Pensionary, and probably of the other\r\ntwo. The substance of his letter was to inform the Marquis, that things\r\nmight easily be disposed, so as to settle a correspondence between that\r\ncrown and the republic, in order to renew the treaty of peace. That this\r\ncould be done with the greater secrecy, because Monsieur Heinsius, by\r\nvirtue of his oath as Pensionary, might keep any affair private as long\r\nas he thought necessary, and was not obliged to communicate it, until he\r\nbelieved things were ripe; and as long as he concealed it from his\r\nmasters, he was not bound to discover it, either to the ministers of the\r\nEmperor, or those of her British Majesty. That since England thought it\r\nproper for King Charles to continue the whole campaign in Catalonia,\r\n(though he should be chosen emperor) in order to support the war in\r\nSpain, it was necessary for France to treat in the most secret manner\r\nwith the States, who were not now so violently, as formerly, against\r\nhaving Philip on the Spanish throne, upon certain conditions for\r\nsecuring their trade, but were jealous of England's design to fortify\r\nsome trading towns in Spain for themselves. That Heinsius, extremely\r\ndesired to get out of the war for some reasons, which he (Petecum) was\r\nnot permitted to tell; and that Vanderdussen and Buys were impatient to\r\nhave the negotiations with France once more set on foot, which, if\r\nMonsieur Torcy thought fit to consent to, Petecum engaged that the\r\nStates would determine to settle the preliminaries, in the midway\r\nbetween Paris and The Hague, with whatever ministers the Most Christian\r\nKing should please to employ. But Monsieur Torcy refused this overture,\r\nand in his answer to Monsieur Petecum, assigned for the reason the\r\ntreatment his master's former proposals had met with at The Hague and\r\nGertruydenberg, from the ministers of Holland. Britain and Holland\r\nseemed pretty well agreed, that those proposals were too loose and\r\nimperfect to be a foundation for entering upon a general treaty; and\r\nMonsieur Gaultier was desired to signify to the French court, that it\r\nwas expected they should explain themselves more particularly on the\r\nseveral articles.\r\n\r\nBut in the mean time the Queen was firmly resolved, that the interests\r\nof her own kingdoms should not be neglected at this juncture, as they\r\nhad formerly twice been, while the Dutch were principal managers of a\r\nnegotiation with France. Her Majesty had given frequent and early notice\r\nto the States, of the general disposition of her people towards a peace,\r\nof her own inability to continue the war upon the old foot, under the\r\ndisadvantage of unequal quotas, and the universal backwardness of her\r\nallies. She had likewise informed them of several advances made to her\r\non the side of France, which she had refused to hearken to, till she had\r\nconsulted with those, her good friends and confederates, and heard their\r\nopinion on that subject: but the Dutch, who apprehended nothing more\r\nthan to see Britain at the head of a treaty, were backward and sullen,\r\ndisliked all proposals by the Queen's intervention, and said it was a\r\npiece of artifice of France to divide the allies; besides, they knew the\r\nministry was young, and the opposite faction had given them assurances,\r\nthat the people of England would never endure a peace without Spain, nor\r\nthe men in power dare to attempt it, after the resolutions of one House\r\nof Parliament to the contrary. But, in the midst of this unwillingness\r\nto receive any overtures from France by the Queen's hands, the Dutch\r\nministers were actually engaged in a correspondence with that court,\r\nwhere they urged our inability to begin a treaty, by reason of those\r\nfactions which themselves had inflamed, and were ready to commence a\r\nnegotiation upon much easier terms than what they supposed we demanded.\r\nFor not to mention the Duke of Lorraine's interposition in behalf of\r\nHolland, which France absolutely refused to accept; the letters sent\r\nfrom the Dutch to that court, were shewn some months after to a British\r\nminister there,[5] which gave much weight to Monsieur de Torcy's\r\ninsinuations; that he knew where to meet with more compliance, if the\r\nnecessity of affairs should force him to it, by our refusal. And the\r\nviolence of the States against our entertaining of that correspondence,\r\nwas only because they knew theirs would never be accepted, at least till\r\nours were thrown off.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Matthew Prior. See note, _ante_, p. 55. [T.S.]] The Queen,\r\nsensible of all this, resolved to provide for her own kingdoms; and\r\nhaving therefore prepared such demands for her principal allies, as\r\nmight be a ground for proceeding to a general treaty, without pretending\r\nto adjust their several interests, she resolved to stipulate in a\r\nparticular manner the advantage of Britain: the following preliminary\r\ndemands were accordingly drawn up, in order to be transmitted to France.\r\n\r\n\"Great Britain will not enter into any negotiation of peace, otherwise\r\nthan upon these conditions, obtained beforehand.\r\n\r\n\"That the union of the two crowns of France and Spain shall be\r\nprevented: that satisfaction shall be given to all the allies, and trade\r\nsettled and maintained.\r\n\r\n\"If France be disposed to treat upon this view, it is not to be doubted\r\nthat the following propositions will be found reasonable.\r\n\r\n\"A barrier shall be formed in the Low Countries for the States-General;\r\nand their trade shall be secured.\r\n\r\n\"A barrier likewise shall be formed for the Empire.\r\n\r\n\"The pretensions of all the allies, founded upon former treaties, shall\r\nbe regulated and determined to their general satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"In order to make a more equal balance of power in Italy, the dominions\r\nand territories, which in the beginning of the present war belonged to\r\nthe Duke of Savoy, and are now in the possession of France, shall be\r\nrestored to his Royal Highness; and such other places in Italy shall be\r\nyielded to him, as will be found necessary and agreeable to the sense of\r\nformer treaties made with this prince.\r\n\r\n\"As to Great Britain in particular, the succession to the crown of the\r\nkingdoms, according to the present establishment, shall be acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\"A new treaty of commerce between Great Britain and France shall be\r\nmade, after the most just and reasonable manner.\r\n\r\n\"Dunkirk shall be demolished.\r\n\r\n\"Gibraltar and Port-Mahon shall remain in the hands of the present\r\npossessors.\r\n\r\n\"The English shall have the Assiento in the same manner the French now\r\nenjoy it; and such places in the Spanish West Indies shall be assigned\r\nto those concerned in this traffic, for the refreshment and sale of\r\ntheir negroes, as shall be found necessary and convenient.\r\n\r\n\"All advantages, rights, and privileges already granted, and which may\r\nhereafter be granted by Spain to the subjects of France, or to any other\r\nnation whatsoever, shall be equally granted to the subjects of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\"And for better securing the British trade in the Spanish West Indies,\r\ncertain places to be named in the treaty of peace, shall be put into\r\npossession of the English.\r\n\r\n\"Newfoundland, with the Bay and Straits of Hudson, shall be entirely\r\nrestored to the English; and Great Britain and France shall severally\r\nkeep and possess all those countries and territories in North America,\r\nwhich each of the said nations shall be in possession of at the time\r\nwhen the ratification of this treaty shall be published in those parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\"These demands, and all other proceedings between Great Britain and\r\nFrance, shall be kept inviolably secret, until they are published by the\r\nmutual consent of both parties.\"\r\n\r\nThe last article was not only intended for avoiding, if possible, the\r\njealousy of the Dutch, but to prevent the clamours of the abettors here\r\nat home, who, under the pretended fears of our doing injustice to the\r\nDutch, by acting without the privity of that republic, in order to make\r\na separate peace, would be ready to drive on the worst designs against\r\nthe Queen and ministry, in order to recover the power they had lost.\r\n\r\nIn June, one thousand seven hundred and eleven, Mr. Prior, a person of\r\ngreat distinction, not only on account of his wit, but for his abilities\r\nin the management of affairs, and who had been formerly employed at the\r\nFrench court, was dispatched thither by Her Majesty with the foregoing\r\ndemands. This gentleman was received at Versailles with great civility.\r\nThe King declared, that no proceeding, in order to a general treaty,\r\nwould be so agreeable to him as by the intervention of England; and that\r\nHis Majesty, being desirous to contribute with all his power towards the\r\nrepose of Europe, did answer to the demands which had been made,\r\n\r\n\"That he would consent freely and sincerely to all just and reasonable\r\nmethods, for hindering the crowns of France and Spain from being ever\r\nunited under the same prince; His Majesty being persuaded, that such an\r\nexcess of power would be as contrary to the general good and repose of\r\nEurope, as it was opposite to the will of the late Catholic King Charles\r\nthe Second. He said his intention was, that all parties in the present\r\nwar should find their reasonable satisfaction in the intended treaty of\r\npeace; and that trade should be settled and maintained for the future,\r\nto the advantage of those nations which formerly possessed it.\r\n\r\n\"That as the King will exactly observe the conditions of peace, whenever\r\nit shall be concluded, and as the object he proposeth to himself, is to\r\nsecure the frontiers of his own kingdom, without giving any sort of\r\ndisturbance to his neighbours, he promiseth to agree, that by the future\r\ntreaty of peace, the Dutch shall be put into possession of all such\r\nfortified places as shall be specified in the said treaty to serve for a\r\nbarrier to that republic, against all attempts on the side of France. He\r\nengages likewise to give all necessary securities, for removing the\r\njealousies raised among the German princes of His Majesty's designs.\r\n\r\n\"That when the conferences, in order to a general treaty, shall be\r\nformed, all the pretensions of the several princes and states engaged in\r\nthe present war, shall be fairly and amicably discussed; nor shall any\r\nthing be omitted, which may regulate and determine them to the\r\nsatisfaction of all parties.\r\n\r\n\"That, pursuant to the demands made by England, His Majesty promiseth to\r\nrestore to the Duke of Savoy these demesnes and territories, which\r\nbelonged to that prince at the beginning of this war, and which His\r\nMajesty is now in possession of; and the King consents further, that\r\nsuch other places in Italy shall be yielded to the Duke of Savoy, as\r\nshall be found necessary, according to the sense of those treaties made\r\nbetween the said Duke and his allies.\r\n\r\n\"That the King's sentiments of the present government of Great Britain,\r\nthe open declaration he had made in Holland of his resolution to treat\r\nof peace, by applications to the English; the assurances he had given of\r\nengaging the King of Spain to leave Gibraltar in their hands (all which\r\nare convincing proofs of his perfect esteem for a nation still in war\r\nwith him); leave no room to doubt of His Majesty's inclination to give\r\nEngland all securities and advantages for their trade, which they can\r\nreasonably demand. But as His Majesty cannot persuade himself, that a\r\ngovernment, so clear-sighted as ours, will insist upon conditions which\r\nmust absolutely destroy the trade of France and Spain, as well as that\r\nof all other nations of Europe, he thinks the demands made by Great\r\nBritain may require a more particular discussion.\r\n\r\n\"That, upon this foundation, the King thought the best way of advancing\r\nand perfecting a negotiation, the beginning of which he had seen with so\r\nmuch satisfaction, would be to send into England a person instructed in\r\nhis intention, and authorized by him to agree upon securities for\r\nsettling the trade of the subjects of England; and those particular\r\nadvantages to be stipulated in their favour, without destroying the\r\ntrade of the French and Spaniards, or of other nations in Christendom.\r\n\r\n\"That therefore His Majesty had charged the person chosen for this\r\ncommission, to answer the other articles of the memorial given him by\r\nMr. Prior, the secret of which should be exactly observed.\"\r\n\r\nMons. de Torcy had, for some years past, used all his endeavours to\r\nincline his master towards a peace, pursuant to the maxim of his uncle\r\nColbert, \"That a long war was not for the interest of France.\" It was\r\nfor this reason the King made choice of him in the conferences at The\r\nHague; the bad success whereof, although it filled him with resentments\r\nagainst the Dutch, did not alter his opinion: but he was violently\r\nopposed by a party both in the court and kingdom, who pretended to fear\r\nhe would sacrifice the glory of the prince and country by too large\r\nconcessions; or perhaps would rather wish that the first offers should\r\nhave been still made to the Dutch, as a people more likely to be less\r\nsolicitous about the interest of Britain, than Her Majesty would\r\ncertainly be for theirs: and the particular design of Mr. Prior was to\r\nfind out, whether that minister had credit enough with his prince, and a\r\nsupport from others in power, sufficient to overrule the faction against\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nMr. Prior's journey[6] could not be kept a secret, as the court here at\r\nfirst seemed to intend it. He was discovered at his return by an officer\r\nof the port at Dover, where he landed, after six weeks absence; upon\r\nwhich the Dutch Gazettes and English newspapers were full of\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See Swift's \"A New Journey to Paris\" (vol. v. of this\r\nedition, pp. 187-205). [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nAt the same time with Mr. Prior there arrived from France Mons.\r\nMesnager, knight of the order of St. Michael, and one of the council of\r\ntrade to the Most Christian King. His commission was, in general,\r\nempowering him to treat with the minister of any prince engaged in the\r\nwar against his master. In his first conferences with the Queen's\r\nministers, he pretended orders to insist, that Her Majesty should enter\r\nupon particular engagements in several articles, which did not depend\r\nupon her, but concerned only the interest of the allies reciprocally\r\nwith those of the Most Christian King; whereas the negotiation had begun\r\nupon this principle, that France should consent to adjust the interests\r\nof Great Britain in the first place, whereby Her Majesty would be\r\nafterwards enabled, by her good offices on all sides, to facilitate the\r\ngeneral peace. The Queen resolved never to depart from this principle;\r\nbut was absolutely determined to remit the particular interests of the\r\nallies to general conferences, where she would do the utmost in her\r\npower to procure the repose of Europe, and the satisfaction of all\r\nparties. It was plain, France could run no hazard by this proceeding,\r\nbecause the preliminary articles would have no force before a general\r\npeace was signed: therefore it was not doubted but Mons. Mesnager would\r\nhave orders to waive this new pretension, and go on in treating upon\r\nthat foot which was at first proposed. In short, the ministers required\r\na positive and speedy answer to the articles in question, since they\r\ncontained only such advantages and securities as Her Majesty thought she\r\nhad a right to require from any prince whatsoever, to whom the dominions\r\nof Spain should happen to fall.\r\n\r\nThe particular demands of Britain were formed into eight articles; to\r\nwhich Mons. Mesnager, having transmitted them to his court and received\r\nnew powers from thence, had orders to give his master's consent, by way\r\nof answers to the several points, to be obligatory only after a general\r\npeace. These demands, together with the answers of the French King, were\r\ndrawn up and signed by Mons. Mesnager, and Her Majesty's two principal\r\nsecretaries of state; whereof I shall here present an extract to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nIn the preamble the Most Christian King sets forth, \"That being\r\nparticularly informed by the last memorial which the British ministers\r\ndelivered to Mons. Mesnager, of the dispositions of this crown to\r\nfacilitate a general peace, to the satisfaction of the several parties\r\nconcerned; and His Majesty finding, in effect, as the said memorial\r\ndeclares, that he runs no hazard by engaging himself in the manner there\r\nexpressed, since the preliminary articles will be of no force, until the\r\nsigning of the general peace; and being sincerely desirous to advance,\r\nto the utmost of his power, the repose of Europe, especially by a way so\r\nagreeable as the interposition of a Princess, whom so many ties of blood\r\nought to unite to him, and whose sentiments for the public tranquillity\r\ncannot be doubted; His Majesty, moved by these considerations, hath\r\nordered Mons. Mesnager, knight, &c. to give the following answers, in\r\nwriting, to the articles contained in the memorial transmitted to him,\r\nintituled, 'Preliminary Demands for Great Britain in particular.'\"\r\n\r\nThe articles were these that follow.\r\n\r\n\"First, The succession to the crown to be acknowledged, according to the\r\npresent establishment.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, A new treaty of commerce between Great Britain and France to\r\nbe made, after the most just and reasonable manner.\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, Dunkirk to be demolished.\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly, Gibraltar and Port-Mahon to continue in the hands of those\r\nwho now possess them.\r\n\r\n\"Fifthly, The Assiento (or liberty of selling negroes to the Spanish\r\nWest Indies) to be granted to the English, in as full a manner as the\r\nFrench possess it at present; and such places in the said West Indies to\r\nbe assigned to the persons concerned in this trade, for the refreshment\r\nand sale of their negroes, as shall be found necessary and convenient.\r\n\r\n\"Sixthly, Whatever advantages, privileges, and rights are already, or\r\nmay hereafter be, granted by Spain to the subjects of France, or any\r\nother nation, shall be equally granted to the subjects of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"Seventhly, For better protecting their trade in the Spanish West\r\nIndies, the English shall be put into possession of such places as shall\r\nbe named in the treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n\"Or, as an equivalent for this article, that the Assiento be granted to\r\nBritain for the term of thirty years.\r\n\r\n\"That the isle of St. Christopher's be likewise secured to the English.\r\n\r\n\"That the advantages and exemption from duties, promised by Monsieur\r\nMesnager, which he affirms will amount to fifteen _per cent_. upon all\r\ngoods of the growth and manufacture of Great Britain, be effectually\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n\"That whereas, on the side of the river of Plate, the English are not in\r\npossession of any colony, a certain extent of territory be allowed them\r\non the said river, for refreshing and keeping their negroes, till they\r\nare sold to the Spaniards; subject, nevertheless, to the inspection of\r\nan officer appointed by Spain.\r\n\r\n\"Eighthly, Newfoundland and the Bay and Straits of Hudson, shall be\r\nentirely restored to the English; and Great Britain and France shall\r\nrespectively keep whatever dominions in North America each of them shall\r\nbe in possession of, when the ratification of this treaty shall be\r\npublished in those parts of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe six first articles were allowed without any difficulty, except that\r\nabout Dunkirk, where France was to have an equivalent, to be settled in\r\na general treaty.\r\n\r\nDifficulty arising upon the seventh article, the proposed equivalent was\r\nallowed instead thereof.\r\n\r\nThe last article was referred to the general treaty of peace, only the\r\nFrench insisted to have the power of fishing for cod, and drying them on\r\nthe island of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThese articles were to be looked upon as conditions, which the Most\r\nChristian King consented to allow; and whenever a general peace should\r\nbe signed, they were to be digested into the usual form of a treaty, to\r\nthe satisfaction of both crowns.\r\n\r\nThe Queen having thus provided for the security and advantage of her\r\nkingdoms, whenever a peace should be made, and upon terms no way\r\ninterfering with the interest of her allies; the next thing in order,\r\nwas to procure from France such preliminary articles, as might be a\r\nground upon which to commence a general treaty. These were adjusted, and\r\nsigned the same day with the former; and having been delivered to the\r\nseveral ministers residing here from the powers in alliance with\r\nEngland, were quickly made public. But the various constructions and\r\ncensures which passed upon them, have made it necessary to give the\r\nreader the following transcript:\r\n\r\n\"The King being willing to contribute all that is in his power, to the\r\nre-establishing of the general peace. His Majesty declares,\r\n\r\n\"I. That he will acknowledge the Queen of Great Britain in that quality,\r\nas also the succession of that crown, according to the settlement,\r\n\r\n\"II. That he will freely, and _bonâ fide_, consent to the taking all\r\njust and reasonable measures, for hindering that the crowns of France\r\nand Spain may ever be united on the head of the same prince; His Majesty\r\nbeing persuaded, that this excess of power would be contrary to the good\r\nand quiet of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"III. The King's intention is, that all the parties engaged in the\r\npresent war, without excepting any of them, may find their reasonable\r\nsatisfaction in the treaty of peace, which shall be made: That commerce\r\nmay be re-established and maintained for the future, to the advantage of\r\nGreat Britain, of Holland, and of the other nations, who have been\r\naccustomed to exercise commerce.\r\n\r\n\"IV. As the King will likewise maintain exactly the observance of the\r\npeace, when it shall be concluded, and the object, the King proposes to\r\nhimself, being to secure the frontiers of his kingdom, without\r\ndisturbing in any manner whatever the neighbouring states, he promises\r\nto agree, by the treaty which shall be made, that the Dutch shall be put\r\nin possession of the fortified places, which shall be mentioned, in the\r\nNetherlands, to serve hereafter for a barrier; which may secure the\r\nquiet of the republic of Holland against any enterprise from the part of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\"V. The King consents likewise, that a secure and convenient barrier\r\nshould be formed for the empire, and for the house of Austria.\r\n\r\n\"VI. Notwithstanding Dunkirk cost the King very great sums, as well to\r\npurchase it, as to fortify it; and that it is further necessary to be at\r\nvery considerable expense for razing the works. His Majesty is willing\r\nhowever to engage to cause them to be demolished, immediately after the\r\nconclusion of the peace, on condition, that, for the fortifications of\r\nthat place, a proper equivalent, that may content him, be given him:\r\nAnd, as England cannot furnish that equivalent, the discussion of it\r\nshall be referred to the conferences to be held for the negotiation of\r\nthe peace.\r\n\r\n\"VII. When the conferences for the negotiation of the peace shall be\r\nformed, all the pretensions of the princes and states, engaged in the\r\npresent war, shall be therein discussed _bonâ fide_, and amicably: And\r\nnothing shall be omitted to regulate and terminate them, to the\r\nsatisfaction of all the parties.\r\n\r\n\"MESNAGER.\"\r\n\r\nThese overtures are founded upon the eighth article of the Grand\r\nAlliance, made in one thousand seven hundred and one; wherein are\r\ncontained the conditions, without which a peace is not to be made; and\r\nwhoever compares both, will find the preliminaries to reach every point\r\nproposed in that article, which those who censured them at home, if they\r\nspoke their thoughts, did not understand: for nothing can be plainer,\r\nthan what the public hath often been told, that the recovery of Spain\r\nfrom the house of Bourbon was a thing never imagined, when the war\r\nbegan, but a just and reasonable satisfaction to the Emperor. Much less\r\nought such a condition to be held necessary at present, not only because\r\nit is allowed on all hands to be impracticable, but likewise because, by\r\nthe changes in the Austrian and Bourbon families, it would not be safe:\r\nneither did those, who were loudest in blaming the French preliminaries,\r\nknow any thing of the advantages privately stipulated for Britain, whose\r\ninterests, they assured us, were all made a sacrifice to the corruption\r\nor folly of the managers; and therefore, because the opposers of peace\r\nhave been better informed by what they have since heard and seen, they\r\nhave changed their battery, and accused the ministers for betraying the\r\nDutch.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Raby, Her Majesty's ambassador at The Hague, having made a\r\nshort journey to England, where he was created Earl of Strafford, went\r\nback to Holland about the beginning of October, one thousand seven\r\nhundred and eleven, with the above preliminaries, in order to\r\ncommunicate them to the Pensionary, and other ministers of the States.\r\nThe Earl was instructed to let them know, \"That the Queen had, according\r\nto their desire, returned an answer to the first propositions signed by\r\nMons. Torcy, signifying, that the French offers were thought, both by\r\nHer Majesty and the States, neither so particular nor so full as they\r\nought to be; and insisting to have a distinct project formed, of such a\r\npeace as the Most Christian King would be willing to conclude: that this\r\naffair having been for some time transacted by papers, and thereby\r\nsubject to delays, Mons. Mesnager was at length sent over by France, and\r\nhad signed those preliminaries now communicated to them: that the\r\nseveral articles did not, indeed, contain such particular concessions as\r\nFrance must and will make in the course of a treaty; but that, however,\r\nHer Majesty thought them a sufficient foundation whereon to open the\r\ngeneral conferences.\r\n\r\n\"That Her Majesty was unwilling to be charged with determining the\r\nseveral interests of her allies, and therefore contented herself with\r\nsuch general offers as might include all the particular demands, proper\r\nto be made during the treaty; where the confederates must resolve to\r\nadhere firmly together, in order to obtain from the enemy the utmost\r\nthat could be hoped for, in the present circumstances of affairs; which\r\nrule, Her Majesty assured the States, she would, on her part, firmly\r\nobserve.\"\r\n\r\nIf the ministers of Holland should express any uneasiness, that Her\r\nMajesty may have settled the interests of her own kingdoms, in a future\r\npeace, by any private agreement, the ambassador was ordered to say,\r\n\"That the Queen had hitherto refused to have the treaty carried on in\r\nher own kingdom, and would continue to do so, unless they (the Dutch)\r\nconstrained her to take another measure: That by these means the States,\r\nand the rest of the allies, would have the opportunity of treating and\r\nadjusting their different pretensions; which Her Majesty would promote\r\nwith all the zeal she had shewn for the common good, and the particular\r\nadvantage of that republic (as they must do her the justice to confess),\r\nin the whole course of her reign: That the Queen had made no stipulation\r\nfor herself, which might clash with the interests of Holland; and that\r\nthe articles to be inserted in a future treaty, for the benefit of\r\nBritain, were, for the most part, such as contained advantages, which\r\nmust either be continued to the enemy, or be obtained by Her Majesty;\r\nbut, however, that no concession should tempt her to hearken to a peace,\r\nunless her good friends and allies the States General had all reasonable\r\nsatisfaction, as to their trade and barrier, as well as in all other\r\nrespects.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these assurances given in the Queen's name, the Earl was to\r\ninsinuate, \"That Her Majesty should have just reason to be offended, and\r\nto think the proceeding between her and the States very unequal, if they\r\nshould pretend to have any further uneasiness upon this head: That being\r\ndetermined to accept no advantages to herself, repugnant to their\r\ninterests, nor any peace, without their reasonable satisfaction, the\r\nfigure she had made during the whole course of the war, and the part she\r\nhad acted, superior to any of the allies, who were more concerned in\r\ndanger and interest, might justly entitle her to settle the concerns of\r\nGreat Britain, before she would consent to a general negotiation.\"\r\n\r\nIf the States should object the engagements the Queen was under, by\r\ntreaties, of making no peace but in concert with them, or the particular\r\nobligations of the Barrier Treaty, the ambassador was to answer, \"That,\r\nas to the former, Her Majesty had not in any sort acted contrary\r\nthereto; That she was so far from making a peace without their consent,\r\nas to declare her firm resolution not to make it without their\r\nsatisfaction; and that what had passed between France and her, amounted\r\nto no more than an introduction to a general treaty.\" As to the latter,\r\nthe Earl had orders to represent very earnestly, \"How much it was even\r\nfor the interest of Holland itself, rather to compound the advantage of\r\nthe Barrier Treaty, than to insist upon the whole, which the house of\r\nAustria, and several other allies, would never consent to: That nothing\r\ncould be more odious to the people of England than many parts of this\r\ntreaty; which would have raised universal indignation, if the utmost\r\ncare had not been taken to quiet the minds of those who were acquainted\r\nwith the terms of that guaranty, and to conceal them from those who were\r\nnot: That it was absolutely necessary to maintain a good harmony between\r\nboth nations, without which it would be impossible at any time to form a\r\nstrength for reducing an exorbitant power, or preserving the balance of\r\nEurope: from whence it followed, that it could not be the true interest\r\nof either country to insist upon any conditions, which might give just\r\napprehension to the other.\r\n\r\n\"That France had proposed Utrecht, Nimeguen, Aix, or Liège, wherein to\r\nhold the general treaty; and Her Majesty was ready to send her\r\nplenipotentiaries, to whichever of those towns the States should\r\napprove.\"\r\n\r\nIf the imperial ministers, or those of the other allies, should object\r\nagainst the preliminaries as no sufficient ground for opening the\r\nconferences, and insist that France should consent to such articles as\r\nwere signed on the part of the allies in the year one thousand seven\r\nhundred and nine, the Earl of Strafford was in answer directed to\r\ninsinuate, \"That the French might have probably been brought to explain\r\nthemselves more particularly, had they not perceived the uneasiness,\r\nimpatience, and jealousy among the allies, during our transactions with\r\nthat court.\" However, he should declare to them, in the Queen's name,\r\n\"That if they were determined to accept of peace upon no terms inferior\r\nto what was formerly demanded, Her Majesty was ready to concur with\r\nthem; but would no longer bear those disproportions of expense, yearly\r\nincreased upon her, nor the deficiency of the confederates in every part\r\nof the war: That it was therefore incumbent upon them to furnish, for\r\nthe future, such quotas of ships and forces as they were now wanting in,\r\nand to increase their expense, while Her Majesty reduced hers to a\r\nreasonable and just proportion.\"\r\n\r\nThat if the ministers of Vienna and Holland should urge their inability\r\nupon this head, the Queen insisted, \"They ought to comply with her in\r\nwar or in peace; Her Majesty desiring nothing, as to the first, but what\r\nthey ought to perform, and what is absolutely necessary: and as to the\r\nlatter, that she had done, and would continue to do, the utmost in her\r\npower towards obtaining such a peace as might be to the satisfaction of\r\nall her allies.\"\r\n\r\nSome days after the Earl of Stafford's departure to Holland, Mons. Buys,\r\npensionary of Amsterdam, arrived here from thence with instructions from\r\nhis masters, to treat upon the subject of the French preliminaries, and\r\nthe methods for carrying on the war. In his first conference with a\r\ncommittee of council, he objected against all the articles, as too\r\ngeneral and uncertain; and against some of them, as prejudicial. He\r\nsaid, \"The French promising that trade should be re-established and\r\nmaintained for the future, was meant in order to deprive the Dutch of\r\ntheir tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixty-four; for the\r\nplenipotentiaries of that crown would certainly expound the word\r\n_rétablir_, to signify no more than restoring the trade of the States to\r\nthe condition it was in immediately before the commencement of the\r\npresent war.\" He said, \"That in the article of Dunkirk, the destruction\r\nof the harbour was not mentioned; and that the fortifications were only\r\nto be razed upon condition of an equivalent, which might occasion a\r\ndifference between Her Majesty and the States, since Holland would think\r\nit hard to have a town less in their barrier for the demolition of\r\nDunkirk; and England would complain to have this thorn continue in their\r\nside, for the sake of giving one town more to the Dutch.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, he objected, \"That where the French promised effectual methods\r\nshould be taken to prevent the union of France and Spain under the same\r\nking, they offered nothing at all for the cession of Spain, which was\r\nthe most important point of the war.\r\n\r\n\"For these reasons, Mons. Buys hoped Her Majesty would alter her\r\nmeasures, and demand specific articles, upon which the allies might\r\ndebate whether they would consent to a negotiation or no.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen, who looked upon all these difficulties, raised about the\r\nmethod of treating, as endeavours to wrest the negotiation out of her\r\nhands, commanded the lords of the committee to let Mons. Buys know,\r\n\"That the experience she formerly had of proceeding by particular\r\npreliminaries towards a general treaty, gave her no encouragement to\r\nrepeat the same method any more: That such a preliminary treaty must be\r\nnegotiated either by some particular allies, or by all. The first, Her\r\nMajesty could never suffer, since she would neither take upon her to\r\nsettle the interests of others, nor submit that others should settle\r\nthose of her own kingdoms. As to the second, it was liable to Mons.\r\nBuys's objection, because the ministers of France would have as fair an\r\nopportunity of sowing division among the allies, when they were all\r\nassembled upon a preliminary treaty, as when the conferences were open\r\nfor a negotiation of peace: That this method could therefore have no\r\nother effect than to delay the treaty, without any advantage: That Her\r\nMajesty was heartily disposed, both then and during the negotiation, to\r\ninsist on every thing necessary for securing the barrier and commerce of\r\nthe States; and therefore hoped the conferences might be opened, without\r\nfarther difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"That Her Majesty did not only consent, but desire to have a plan\r\nsettled for carrying on the war, as soon as the negotiation of peace\r\nshould begin; but expected to have the burthen more equally laid, and\r\nmore agreeable to treaties; and would join with the States in pressing\r\nthe allies to perform their parts, as she had endeavoured to animate\r\nthem by her example.\"\r\n\r\nMons. Buys seemed to know little of his masters' mind, and pretended he\r\nhad no power to conclude upon any thing.[1] Her Majesty's minister\r\nproposed to him an alliance between the two nations, to subsist after a\r\npeace. To this he hearkened very readily, and offered to take the matter\r\n_ad referendum_, having authority to do no more. His intention was, that\r\nhe might appear to negotiate, in order to gain time to pick out, if\r\npossible, the whole secret of the transactions between Britain and\r\nFrance; to disclose nothing himself, nor bind his masters to any\r\nconditions; to seek delays till the Parliament met, and then observe\r\nwhat turn it took, and what would be the issue of those frequent cabals\r\nbetween himself and some other foreign ministers, in conjunction with\r\nthe chief leaders of the discontented faction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Buys's mission seemed to have been to act on behalf of the\r\nStates General for the purpose of preventing England obtaining any\r\ncommercial advantage which the States did not share, and for causing\r\ndelays. He certainly had no powers to treat definitely, and Swift's\r\nremark is emphasized by the statement in the Bolingbroke Correspondence\r\n(vol. ii. p. 25) about him, he could \"only speak as Monsieur Buys.\"\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch hoped, that the clamours raised against the proceedings of the\r\nQueen's ministers towards a peace, would make the Parliament disapprove\r\nwhat had been done; whereby the States would be at the head of the\r\nnegotiation, which the Queen did not think fit to have any more in their\r\nhands, where it had miscarried twice already; although Prince Eugene\r\nhimself owned, \"that France was then disposed to conclude a peace upon\r\nsuch conditions, as it was not worth the life of a grenadier to refuse\r\nthem.\" As to insisting upon specific preliminaries, Her Majesty thought\r\nher own method much better, for each ally, in the course of the\r\nnegotiation, to advance and manage his own pretensions, wherein she\r\nwould support and assist them, rather than for two ministers of one ally\r\nto treat solely with the enemy, and report what they pleased to the\r\nrest, as was practised by the Dutch at Gertruydenberg.\r\n\r\nOne part of Mons. Buys's instructions was to desire the Queen not to be\r\nso far amused by a treaty of peace, as to neglect her preparation for\r\nwar against the next campaign. Her Majesty, who was firmly resolved\r\nagainst submitting any longer to that unequal burthen of expense she had\r\nhitherto lain under, commanded Mr. Secretary St. John to debate the\r\nmatter with that minister, who said he had no power to treat; only\r\ninsisted, that his masters had fully done their part, and that nothing\r\nbut exhortations could be used to prevail on the other allies to act\r\nwith greater vigour.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the Queen refused to concert any plan for the\r\nprosecution of the war, till the States would join with her in agreeing\r\nto open the conferences of peace; which therefore, by Mons. Buys's\r\napplication to them, was accordingly done, by a resolution taken in\r\nHolland upon the twenty first of November, one thousand seven hundred\r\nand eleven, NS.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Count de Gallas[7] was forbid the court, by order\r\nfrom the Queen, who sent him word, that she looked upon him no longer as\r\na public minister.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The Austrian ambassador [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis gentleman thought fit to act a very dishonourable part here in\r\nEngland, altogether inconsistent with the character he bore of envoy\r\nfrom the late and present emperors, two princes under the strictest ties\r\nof gratitude to the Queen, especially the latter, who had then the title\r\nof King of Spain. Count Gallas, about the end of August, one thousand\r\nseven hundred and eleven, with the utmost privacy, dispatched an\r\nItalian, one of his clerks, to Frankfort, where the Earl of Peterborough\r\nwas then expected. This man was instructed to pass for a Spaniard, and\r\ninsinuate himself into the Earl's service, which he accordingly did, and\r\ngave constant information to the last emperor's secretary at Frankfort\r\nof all he could gather up in his lordship's family, as well as copies of\r\nseveral letters he had transcribed. It was likewise discovered that\r\nGallas had, in his dispatches to the present emperor, then in Spain,\r\nrepresented the Queen and her ministers as not to be confided in, that\r\nwhen Her Majesty had dismissed the Earl of Sunderland, she promised to\r\nproceed no farther in the change of her servants, yet soon after turned\r\nthem all out, and thereby ruined the public credit, as well as abandoned\r\nSpain, that the present ministers wanted the abilities and good\r\ndispositions of the former, were persons of ill designs, and enemies to\r\nthe common cause, and he (Gallas) could not trust them. In his letters\r\nto Count Zinzendorf[8] he said, \"That Mr. Secretary St John complained\r\nof the house of Austria's backwardness, only to make the King of Spain\r\nodious to England, and the people here desirous of a peace, although it\r\nwere ever so bad one,\" to prevent which, Count Gallas drew up a memorial\r\nwhich he intended to give the Queen, and transmitted a draught of it to\r\nZinzendorf for his advice and approbation. This memorial, among other\r\ngreat promises to encourage the continuance of the war, proposed the\r\ndetaching a good body of troops from Hungary to serve in Italy or Spain,\r\nas the Queen should think fit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Austrian envoy at The Hague, characterized by Mr Walter\r\nSichel as \"a martyr to etiquette, and devoured by zeal for the Holy\r\nRoman Empire\" (\"Bolingbroke and his Times,\" p 392)  [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nZinzendorf thought this too bold a step, without consulting the Emperor:\r\nto which Gallas replied, that his design was only to engage the Queen to\r\ngo on with the war; that Zinzendorf knew how earnestly the English and\r\nDutch had pressed to have these troops from Hungary, and therefore they\r\nought to be promised, in order to quiet those two nations, after which\r\nseveral ways might be found to elude that promise; and, in the mean\r\ntime, the great point would be gained of bringing the English to declare\r\nfor continuing the war: that the Emperor might afterwards excuse\r\nhimself, by the apprehension of a war in Hungary, or of that between the\r\nTurks and Muscovites: that if these excuses should be at an end, a\r\ndetachment of one or two regiments might be sent, and the rest deferred,\r\nby pretending want of money; by which the Queen would probably be\r\nbrought to maintain some part of those troops, and perhaps the whole\r\nbody. He added, that this way of management was very common among the\r\nallies; and gave for an example, the forces which the Dutch had promised\r\nfor the service of Spain, but were never sent; with several other\r\ninstances of the same kind, which he said might be produced.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, who had long suspected that Count Gallas was engaged in\r\nthese and the like practices, having at last received authentic proofs\r\nof this whole intrigue, from original letters, and the voluntary\r\nconfession of those who were principally concerned in carrying it on,\r\nthought it necessary to show her resentment, by refusing the count any\r\nmore access to her person or her court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Queen, as it hath been already observed, was resolved to\r\nopen the conferences upon the general preliminaries, yet she thought it\r\nwould very much forward the peace to know what were the utmost\r\nconcessions which France would make to the several allies, but\r\nespecially to the States General and the Duke of Savoy: therefore, while\r\nHer Majesty was pressing the former to agree to a general treaty, the\r\nAbbé Gaultier was sent to France with a memorial, to desire that the\r\nMost Christian King would explain himself upon those preliminaries,\r\nparticularly with relation to Savoy and Holland, whose satisfaction the\r\nQueen had most at heart, as well from her friendship to both these\r\npowers, as because, if she might engage to them that their just\r\npretensions would be allowed, few difficulties would remain, of any\r\nmoment, to retard the general peace.\r\n\r\nThe French answer to this memorial contained several schemes and\r\nproposals for the satisfaction of each ally, coming up very near to what\r\nHer Majesty and her ministers thought reasonable. The greatest\r\ndifficulties seemed to be about the Elector of Bavaria, for whose\r\ninterests France appeared to be as much concerned, as the Queen was for\r\nthose of the Duke of Savoy: however, those were judged not very hard to\r\nbe surmounted.\r\n\r\nThe States having at length agreed to a general treaty, the following\r\nparticulars were concerted between Her Majesty and that republic:\r\n\r\n\"That the congress should be held at Utrecht.\r\n\r\n\"That the opening of the congress should be upon the twelfth of January,\r\nN.S. one thousand seven hundred and eleven-twelve.\r\n\r\n\"That, for avoiding all inconveniences of ceremony, the ministers of the\r\nQueen and States, during the treaty, should only have the characters of\r\nplenipotentiaries, and not take that of ambassadors, till the day on\r\nwhich the peace should be signed.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, The Queen and States insisted, that the ministers of the Duke\r\nof Anjou, and the late Electors of Bavaria and Cologne, should not\r\nappear at the congress, until the points relating to their masters were\r\nadjusted; and were firmly resolved not to send their passports for the\r\nministers of France, till the Most Christian King declared, that the\r\nabsence of the forementioned ministers should not delay the progress of\r\nthe negotiation.\"\r\n\r\nPursuant to the three former articles, Her Majesty wrote circular\r\nletters to all the allies engaged with her in the present war: and\r\nFrance had notice, that as soon as the King declared his compliance with\r\nthe last article, the blank passports should be filled up with the names\r\nof the Maréchal d'Uxelles,[9] the Abbé de Polignac, and Mons. Mesnager,\r\nwho were appointed plenipotentiaries for that crown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In his \"Letter to Sir William Windham,\" Bolingbroke thus\r\nrefers to M. d'Uxelles: \"The minister who had the principal direction of\r\nforeign affairs I lived in friendship with, and I must own to his\r\nhonour, that he never encouraged a design which he knew that his court\r\nhad no intention of supporting\" (p. 141). This was written of the time\r\nwhen Bolingbroke was in Paris, an adherent of the Pretender. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nFrom what I have hitherto deduced, the reader sees the plan which the\r\nQueen thought the most effectual for advancing a peace. As the\r\nconferences were to begin upon the general preliminaries, the Queen was\r\nto be empowered by France to offer separately to the allies what might\r\nbe reasonable for each to accept; and her own interests being previously\r\nsettled, she was to act as a general mediator: a figure that became her\r\nbest, from the part she had in the war, and more useful to the great end\r\nat which she aimed, of giving a safe and honourable peace to Europe.\r\n\r\nBesides, it was absolutely necessary, for the interests of Britain, that\r\nthe Queen should be at the head of the negotiation, without which Her\r\nMajesty could find no expedient to redress the injuries her kingdoms\r\nwere sure to suffer by the Barrier Treaty. In order to settle this point\r\nwith the States, the ministers here had a conference with Mons. Buys, a\r\nfew days before the Parliament met. He was told, how necessary it was,\r\nby previous concert between the Emperor, the Queen, and the States, to\r\nprevent any difference which might arise in the course of the treaty at\r\nUtrecht: That, under pretence of a barrier for the States General, as\r\ntheir security against France, infinite prejudice might arise to the\r\ntrade of Britain in the Spanish Netherlands; for, by the fifteenth\r\narticle of the Barrier Treaty, in consequence of what was stipulated by\r\nthat of Minister, the Queen was brought to engage that commerce shall\r\nnot be rendered more easy, in point of duties, by the sea-ports of\r\nFlanders, than it is by the river Scheldt, and by the canals on the side\r\nof the Seven Provinces, which, as things now stood, was very unjust;\r\nfor, while the towns in Flanders were in the hands of France or Spain,\r\nthe Dutch and we traded to them upon equal foot; but now, since by the\r\nBarrier Treaty those towns were to be possessed by the States, that\r\nrepublic might lay what duties they pleased upon British goods, after\r\npassing by Ostend, and make their own custom-free, which would utterly\r\nruin our whole trade with Flanders.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the lords told Mons. Buys very frankly, \"That if the States\r\nexpected the Queen should support their barrier, as well as their\r\ndemands from France and the house of Austria upon that head, they ought\r\nto agree, that the subjects of Britain should trade as freely to all the\r\ncountries and places, which, by virtue of any former or future treaty,\r\nwere to become the barrier of the States, as they did in the time of the\r\nlate King Charles the Second of Spain; or as the subjects of the States\r\nGeneral themselves shall do: and that it was hoped, their High\r\nMightinesses would never scruple to rectify a mistake so injurious to\r\nthat nation, without whose blood and treasure they would have had no\r\nbarrier at all.\" Mons. Buys had nothing to answer against these\r\nobjections, but said, he had already wrote to his masters for further\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nGreater difficulties occurred about settling what should be the barrier\r\nto the States after a peace: the envoy insisting to have all the towns\r\nthat were named in the Treaty of Barrier and Succession; and the Queen's\r\nministers excepting those towns, which, if they continued in the hands\r\nof the Dutch, would render the trade of Britain to Flanders precarious.\r\nAt length it was agreed in general, that the States ought to have what\r\nis really essential to the security of their barrier against France; and\r\nthat some amicable expedient should be found, for removing the fears\r\nboth of Britain and Holland upon this point.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time Mons. Buys was told, \"That although the Queen would\r\ncertainly insist to obtain all those points from France, in behalf of\r\nher allies the States, yet she hoped his masters were too reasonable to\r\nbreak off the treaty, rather than not obtain the very utmost of their\r\ndemands, which could not be settled here, unless he were fully\r\ninstructed to speak and conclude upon that subject: That Her Majesty\r\nthought the best way of securing the common interest, and preventing the\r\ndivision of the allies, by the artifices of France, in the course of a\r\nlong negotiation, would be to concert between the Queen's ministers and\r\nthose of the States, with a due regard to the other confederates, such a\r\nplan as might amount to a safe and honourable peace.\" After which the\r\nAbbé Polignac, who of the French plenipotentiaries was most in the\r\nsecret of his court, might be told, \"That it was in vain to amuse each\r\nother any longer; that on such terms the peace would be immediately\r\nconcluded; and that the conferences must cease, if those conditions were\r\nnot, without delay, and with expedition, granted.\"\r\n\r\nA treaty between Her Majesty and the States, to subsist after a peace,\r\nwas now signed, Mons. Buys having received full powers to that purpose.\r\nHis masters were desirous to have a private article added, _sub spe\r\nrati_, concerning those terms of peace; without the granting of which,\r\nwe should stipulate not to agree with the enemy. But neither the\r\ncharacter of Buys, nor the manner in which he was empowered to treat,\r\nwould allow the Queen to enter into such an engagement. The congress\r\nlikewise approaching, there was not time to settle a point of so great\r\nimportance. Neither, lastly, would Her Majesty be tied down by Holland,\r\nwithout previous satisfaction upon several articles in the Barrier\r\nTreaty, so inconsistent with her engagements to other powers in the\r\nalliance, and so injurious to her own kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe lord privy seal, and the Earl of Stafford, having, about the time\r\nthe Parliament met, been appointed Her Majesty's plenipotentiaries for\r\ntreating a general peace, I shall here break off the account of any\r\nfurther progress made in that great affair, until I resume it in the\r\nlast book of this History.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****       *****       *****       *****       *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE FOUR LAST\r\n\r\nYEARS OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons seemed resolved, from the beginning of the session,\r\nto inquire strictly not only into all abuses relating to the accounts of\r\nthe army, but likewise into the several treaties between us and our\r\nallies, upon what articles and conditions they were first agreed to, and\r\nhow these had been since observed. In the first week of their sitting,\r\nthey sent an address to the Queen, to desire that the treaty, whereby\r\nHer Majesty was obliged to furnish forty thousand men, to act in\r\nconjunction with the forces of her allies in the Low Countries, might be\r\nlaid before the House. To which the secretary of state brought an\r\nanswer, \"That search had been made, but no footsteps could be found of\r\nany treaty or convention for that purpose.\" It was this unaccountable\r\nneglect in the former ministry, which first gave a pretence to the\r\nallies for lessening their quotas, so much to the disadvantage of Her\r\nMajesty, her kingdoms, and the common cause, in the course of the war.\r\nIt had been stipulated by the Grand Alliance, between the Emperor,\r\nBritain, and the States, that those three powers should assist each\r\nother with their whole force, and that the several proportions should be\r\nspecified in a particular convention. But if any such convention were\r\nmade, it was never ratified; only the parties agreed, by common consent,\r\nto take each a certain share of the burthen upon themselves, which the\r\nlate King William communicated to the House of Commons by his secretary\r\nof state; and which afterwards the other two powers, observing the\r\nmighty zeal in our ministry for prolonging the war, eluded as they\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners for stating the public accounts of the kingdom, had,\r\nin executing their office the preceding summer, discovered several\r\npractices relating to the affairs of the army, which they drew up in a\r\nreport, and delivered to the House.\r\n\r\nThe Commons began their examination of the report with a member of their\r\nown, Mr. Robert Walpole, already mentioned; who, during his being\r\nsecretary at war, had received five hundred guineas, and taken a note\r\nfor five hundred pounds more, on account of two contracts for forage of\r\nthe queen's troops quartered in Scotland. He endeavoured to excuse the\r\nfirst contract; but had nothing to say about the second. The first\r\nappeared so plain and so scandalous to the Commons, that they voted the\r\nauthor of it guilty of a high breach of trust, and notorious corruption,\r\ncommitted him prisoner to the Tower, where he continued to the end of\r\nthe session, and expelled him the House.[1] He was a person much\r\ncaressed by the opposers of the Queen and ministry, having been first\r\ndrawn into their party by his indifference to any principles, and\r\nafterwards kept steady by the loss of his place. His bold, forward\r\ncountenance, altogether a stranger to that infirmity which makes men\r\nbashful, joined to a readiness of speaking in public, hath justly\r\nentitled him, among those of his faction, to be a sort of leader of the\r\nsecond form. The reader must excuse me for being so particular about\r\none, who is otherwise altogether obscure.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Part Hist,\" vi. 1071. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Walpole was not too obscure, however, to be then the object\r\nof Bolingbroke's attack; and in 1726, when Bolingbroke had again\r\nattacked Walpole, this time in a letter, the latter replied: \"Whatever\r\ncontradictions these gentlemen may have observed in my character; there\r\nis one which I'll venture to assure you, you will never discover, which\r\nis my ever being alarmed at an opposition from one in the impotence of\r\ndisgrace, who could never terrify me in the zenith of his prosperity.\"\r\n\"An Answer to the Occasional Writer.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAnother part of the report concerned the Duke of Marlborough, who had\r\nreceived large sums of money, by way of gratuity, from those who were\r\nthe undertakers for providing the army with bread.[3] This the Duke\r\nexcused, in a letter to the commissioners, from the like practice of\r\nother generals: but that excuse appeared to be of little weight, and the\r\nmischievous consequences of such a corruption were visible enough; since\r\nthe money given by these undertakers were but bribes for connivance at\r\ntheir indirect dealings with the army. And as frauds, that begin at the\r\ntop, are apt to spread through all the subordinate ranks of those who\r\nhave any share in the management, and to increase as they circulate: so,\r\nin this case, for every thousand pounds given to the general, the\r\nsoldiers at least suffered fourfold.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See \"The Examiner,\" Nos. 17 and 28, in vol. ix. of this\r\nedition. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nAnother article of this report, relating to the Duke, was yet of more\r\nimportance. The greatest part of Her Majesty's forces in Flanders were\r\nmercenary troops, hired from several princes of Europe. It was found\r\nthat the Queen's general subtracted two and a half _per cent_, out of\r\nthe pay of those troops, for his own use, which amounted to a great\r\nannual sum. The Duke of Marlborough, in his letter already mentioned,\r\nendeavouring to extenuate the matter, told the commissioners, \"That this\r\ndeduction was a free gift from the foreign troops, which he had\r\nnegotiated with them by the late King's orders, and had obtained the\r\nQueen's warrant for reserving and receiving it: That it was intended for\r\nsecret service, the ten thousand pounds a year given by Parliament not\r\nproving sufficient, and had all been laid out that way.\" The\r\ncommissioners observed, in answer, \"That the warrant was kept dormant\r\nfor nine years, as indeed no entry of it appeared in the secretary of\r\nstate's books, and the deduction of it concealed all that time from the\r\nknowledge of Parliament: That, if it had been a free gift from the\r\nforeign troops, it would not have been stipulated by agreement, as the\r\nDuke's letter confessed, and as his warrant declared, which latter\r\naffirmed this stoppage to be intended for defraying extraordinary\r\ncontingent expenses of the troops, and therefore should not have been\r\napplied to secret services.\" They submitted to the House, whether the\r\nwarrant itself were legal, or duly countersigned. The commissioners\r\nadded, \"That no receipt was ever given for this deducted money, nor was\r\nit mentioned in any receipts from the foreign troops, which were always\r\ntaken in full. And lastly, That the whole sum, on computation, amounted\r\nto near three hundred thousand pounds.\"\r\n\r\nThe House, after a long debate, resolved, \"That the taking several sums\r\nfrom the contractors for bread by the Duke of Marlborough, was\r\nunwarrantable and illegal; and that the two and a half _per cent_,\r\ndeducted from the foreign troops, was public money, and ought to be\r\naccounted for:\" which resolutions were laid before the Queen by the\r\nwhole House, and Her Majesty promised to do her part in redressing what\r\nwas complained of. The Duke and his friends had, about the beginning of\r\nthe war, by their credit with the Queen, procured a warrant from Her\r\nMajesty for this perquisite of two and a half _per cent_. The warrant\r\nwas directed to the Duke of Marlborough, and countersigned by Sir\r\nCharles Hedges, then secretary of state; by virtue of which the\r\npaymaster-general of the army was to pay the said deducted money to the\r\ngeneral, and take a receipt in full from the foreign troops.\r\n\r\nIt was observed, as very commendable and becoming the dignity of such an\r\nassembly, that this debate was managed with great temper, and with few\r\npersonal reflections upon the Duke of Marlborough. They seemed only\r\ndesirous to come at the truth, without which they could not answer the\r\ntrust reposed in them by those whom they represented, and left the rest\r\nto Her Majesty's prudence. The attorney-general was ordered to commence\r\nan action against the Duke for the subtracted money, which would have\r\namounted to a great sum, enough to ruin any private person, except\r\nhimself. This process is still depending, although very moderately\r\npursued, either by the Queen's indulgence to one whom she had formerly\r\nso much trusted, or perhaps to be revived or slackened, according to the\r\nfuture demeanour of the defendant.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Marlborough's defence of himself may be found in the\r\n\"Parliamentary History,\" vol. vi., 1079. Writing to the Earl of\r\nStrafford, under date January 27, 1711, Bolingbroke speaking of this\r\ndebate on Marlborough says: \"What passed on Thursday in the House of\r\nCommons, will, I hope, show people abroad, as well as at home, that no\r\nmerit, no grandeur, no riches can excuse, or save any one, who sets\r\nhimself up in opposition to the Queen;\" and, he might have added, to\r\nMrs. Masham. It is to be questioned if Marlborough would have had to\r\nundergo the ordeal of this debate had it not been for the animosity\r\nagainst him on the part of this lady and her royal mistress, so deftly\r\naroused by Harley. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nSome time after, Mr. Cardonnell,[5] a Member of Parliament, and\r\nsecretary to the general in Flanders, was expelled the House, for the\r\noffence of receiving yearly bribes from those who had contracted to\r\nfurnish bread for the army; and met with no further punishment for a\r\npractice, voted to be unwarrantable and corrupt.\r\n\r\nThese were all the censures of any moment which the Commons, under so\r\ngreat a weight of business, thought fit to make, upon the reports of\r\ntheir commissioners for inspecting the public accounts. But having\r\npromised, in the beginning of this History, to examine the state of the\r\nnation, with respect to its debts; by what negligence or corruption they\r\nfirst began, and in process of time made such a prodigious increase;\r\nand, lastly, what courses have been taken, under the present\r\nadministration, to find out funds for answering so many unprovided\r\nincumbrances, as well as put a stop to new ones; I shall endeavour to\r\nsatisfy the reader upon this important article.\r\n\r\nBy all I have yet read of the history of our own country, it appears to\r\nme, that the national debts, secured upon parliamentary funds of\r\ninterest, were things unknown in England before the last Revolution\r\nunder the Prince of Orange. It is true, that in the grand rebellion the\r\nking's enemies borrowed money of particular persons, upon what they\r\ncalled the public faith; but this was only for short periods, and the\r\nsums no more than what they could pay at once, as they constantly did.\r\nSome of our kings have been very profuse in peace and war, and are\r\nblamed in history for their oppressions of the people by severe taxes,\r\nand for borrowing money which they never paid:[6] but national debts was\r\na style, which, I doubt, would hardly then be understood. When the\r\nPrince of Orange was raised to the throne, and a general war began in\r\nthese parts of Europe, the King and his counsellors thought it would be\r\nill policy to commence his reign with heavy taxes upon the people, who\r\nhad lived long in ease and plenty, and might be apt to think their\r\ndeliverance too dearly bought: wherefore one of the first actions of the\r\nnew government was to take off the tax upon chimneys, as a burthen very\r\nungrateful to the commonalty. But money being wanted to support the war\r\n(which even the convention-parliament, that put the crown upon his head,\r\nwere very unwilling he should engage in), the present Bishop of\r\nSalisbury[7] is said to have found out that expedient (which he had\r\nlearned in Holland) of raising money upon the security of taxes, that\r\nwere only sufficient to pay a large interest. The motives which\r\nprevailed on people to fall in with this project were many, and\r\nplausible; for supposing, as the ministers industriously gave out, that\r\nthe war could not last above one or two campaigns at most, it might be\r\ncarried on with very moderate taxes; and the debts accruing would, in\r\nprocess of time, be easily cleared after a peace. Then the bait of large\r\ninterest would draw in a great number of those whose money, by the\r\ndangers and difficulties of trade, lay dead upon their hands; and\r\nwhoever were lenders to the government, would, by surest principle, be\r\nobliged to support it. Besides, the men of estates could not be\r\npersuaded, without time and difficulty, to have those taxes laid on\r\ntheir lands, which custom hath since made so familiar; and it was the\r\nbusiness of such as were then in power to cultivate a moneyed interest;\r\nbecause the gentry of the kingdom did not very much relish those new\r\nnotions in government, to which the King, who had imbibed his politics\r\nin his own country, was thought to give too much way. Neither perhaps\r\ndid that Prince think national incumbrances to be any evil at all, since\r\nthe flourishing republic, where he was born, is thought to owe more than\r\never it will be able or willing to pay. And I remember, when I mentioned\r\nto Mons. Buys the many millions we owed, he would advance it as a maxim,\r\nthat it was for the interest of the public to be in debt: which perhaps\r\nmay be true in a commonwealth so crazily instituted, where the governors\r\ncannot have too many pledges of their subjects' fidelity, and where a\r\ngreat majority must inevitably be undone by any revolution, however\r\nbrought about: but to prescribe the same rules to a monarchy, whose\r\nwealth ariseth from the rents and improvements of lands, as well as\r\ntrade and manufactures, is the mark of a confined and cramped\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Adam Cardonnell, Esq., secretary to the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, shared in his disgrace. See \"The Examiner,\" No. 28.\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: P. Fitzgerald says \"which they have not been able or\r\nwilling to pay.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Dr. Gilbert Burnet. [ORIGINAL NOTE.]]\r\n\r\nI was moved to speak thus, because I am very well satisfied, that the\r\npernicious counsels of borrowing money upon public funds of interest, as\r\nwell as some other state lessons, were taken indigested from the like\r\npractices among the Dutch, without allowing in the least for any\r\ndifference in government, religion, law, custom, extent of country, or\r\nmanners and dispositions of the people.\r\n\r\nBut when this expedient of anticipations and mortgages was first put in\r\npractice, artful men, in office and credit, began to consider what uses\r\nit might be applied to; and soon found it was likely to prove the most\r\nfruitful seminary, not only to establish a faction they intended to set\r\nup for their own support, but likewise to raise vast wealth for\r\nthemselves in particular, who were to be the managers and directors in\r\nit. It was manifest, that nothing could promote these two designs so\r\nmuch, as burthening the nation with debts, and giving encouragement to\r\nlenders: for, as to the first, it was not to be doubted, that moneyed\r\nmen would be always firm to the party of those who advised the borrowing\r\nupon such good security, and with such exorbitant premiums and interest;\r\nand every new sum that was lent, took away as much power from the landed\r\nmen, as it added to theirs: so that the deeper the kingdom was engaged,\r\nit was still the better for them. Thus a new estate and property sprung\r\nup in the hands of mortgagees, to whom every house and foot of land in\r\nEngland paid a rent-charge, free of all taxes and defalcations, and\r\npurchased at less than half value. So that the gentlemen of estates\r\nwere, in effect, but tenants to these new landlords; many of whom were\r\nable, in time, to force the election of boroughs out of the hands of\r\nthose who had been the old proprietors and inhabitants. This was arrived\r\nat such a height, that a very few years more of war and funds would have\r\nclearly cast the balance on the moneyed side.\r\n\r\nAs to the second, this project of borrowing upon funds, was of mighty\r\nadvantage to those who were in the management of it, as well as to their\r\nfriends and dependants; for, funds proving often deficient, the\r\ngovernment was obliged to strike tallies for making up the rest, which\r\ntallies were sometimes (to speak in the merchants' phrase) at above\r\nforty _per cent_, discount. At this price those who were in the secret\r\nbought them up, and then took care to have that deficiency supplied in\r\nthe next session of Parliament, by which they doubled their principal in\r\na few months; and, for the encouragement of lenders, every new project\r\nof lotteries or annuities proposed some farther advantage, either as to\r\ninterest or premium.\r\n\r\nIn the year one thousand six hundred and ninety-seven, a general\r\nmortgage was made of certain revenues and taxes already settled, which\r\namounted to near a million a year. This mortgage was to continue till\r\none thousand seven hundred and six, to be a fund for the payment of\r\nabout five millions one hundred thousand pounds. In the first Parliament\r\nof the Queen, the said mortgage was continued till one thousand seven\r\nhundred and ten, to supply a deficiency of two millions three hundred\r\nthousand pounds, and interest of above a million; and in the\r\nintermediate years a great part of that fund was branched out into\r\nannuities for ninety-nine years; so that the late ministry raised all\r\ntheir money to one thousand seven hundred and ten, only by continuing\r\nfunds which were already granted to their hands. This deceived the\r\npeople in general, who were satisfied to continue the payments they had\r\nbeen accustomed to, and made the administration seem easy, since the war\r\nwent on without any new taxes raised, except the very last year they\r\nwere in power; not considering what a mighty fund was exhausted, and\r\nmust be perpetuated, although extremely injurious to trade, and to the\r\ntrue interest of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis great fund of the general mortgage was not only loaded, year after\r\nyear, by mighty sums borrowed upon it, but with the interests due upon\r\nthose sums; for which the treasury was forced to strike tallies, payable\r\nout of that fund, after all the money already borrowed upon it, there\r\nbeing no other provision of interest for three or four years: till at\r\nlast the fund was so overloaded, that it could neither pay principal nor\r\ninterest, and tallies were struck for both, which occasioned their great\r\ndiscount.\r\n\r\nBut to avoid mistakes upon a subject, where I am not very well versed\r\neither in the style or matter, I will transcribe an account sent me by a\r\nperson[8] who is thoroughly instructed in these affairs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Sir John Blunt. [ORIGINAL NOTE.] He was one of the first\r\nprojectors of the South Sea Company, and died in January, 1733. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\"In the year one thousand seven hundred and seven, the sum of eight\r\nhundred twenty-two thousand three hundred and eighty one pounds, fifteen\r\nshillings and sixpence, was raised, by continuing part of the general\r\nmortgage from one thousand seven hundred and ten to one thousand seven\r\nhundred and twelve; but with no provision of interest till August the\r\nfirst, one thousand seven hundred and ten, otherwise than by striking\r\ntallies for it on that fund, payable after all the other money borrowed.\r\n\r\n\"In one thousand seven hundred and eight, the same funds were continued\r\nfrom one thousand seven hundred and twelve to one thousand seven hundred\r\nand fourteen, to raise seven hundred twenty-nine thousand sixty-seven\r\npounds fifteen shillings and sixpence; but no provision for interest\r\ntill August the first, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, otherwise\r\nthan as before, by striking tallies for it on the same fund, payable\r\nafter all the rest of the money borrowed. And the discount of tallies\r\nthen beginning to rise, great part of that money remains still unraised;\r\nand there is nothing to pay interest for the money lent, till August the\r\nfirst, one thousand seven hundred and twelve. But the late lord\r\ntreasurer struck tallies for the full sum directed by the act to be\r\nborrowed, great part of which have been delivered in payment to the navy\r\nand victualling offices, and some are still in the hands of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\"In one thousand seven hundred and nine, part of the same fund was\r\ncontinued from August the first, one thousand seven hundred and\r\nfourteen, to August the first, one thousand seven hundred and sixteen,\r\nto raise six hundred and forty-five thousand pounds; and no provision\r\nfor interest till August the first, one thousand seven hundred and\r\nfourteen (which was about five years), but by borrowing money on the\r\nsame fund, payable after the sums before lent; so that little of that\r\nmoney was lent But the tallies were struck for what was unlent, some of\r\nwhich were given out for the payment of the navy and victualling, and\r\nsome still remain in the hands of the government.\r\n\r\n\"In one thousand seven hundred and ten, the sums which were before given\r\nfrom one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, to one thousand seven\r\nhundred and sixteen, were continued from thence to one thousand seven\r\nhundred and twenty, to raise one million two hundred and ninety-six\r\nthousand five hundred and fifty-two pounds nine shillings and\r\nelevenpence three farthings; and no immediate provision for interest\r\ntill August the first, one thousand seven hundred and sixteen; only,\r\nafter the duty of one shilling _per_ bushel on salt should be cleared\r\nfrom the money it was then charged with, and which was not so cleared\r\ntill Midsummer one thousand seven hundred and twelve last, then that\r\nfund was to be applied to pay the interest till August the first, one\r\nthousand seven hundred and sixteen, which interest amounted to about\r\nseventy-seven thousand seven hundred and ninety-three pounds _per\r\nannum_: and the said salt fund produceth but about fifty-five thousand\r\npounds _per annum_; so that no money was borrowed upon the general\r\nmortgage in one thousand seven hundred and ten, except one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand pounds lent by the Swiss cantons; but tallies were struck\r\nfor the whole sum. These all remained in the late treasurer's hands at\r\nthe time of his removal, yet the money was expended, which occasioned\r\nthose great demands upon the commissioners of the treasury who succeeded\r\nhim, and were forced to pawn those tallies to the bank, or to remitters,\r\nrather than sell them at twenty or twenty-five _per cent_. discount, as\r\nthe price then was. About two hundred thousand pounds of them they paid\r\nto clothiers of the army, and others; and all the rest, being above\r\nninety thousand pounds, have been subscribed into the South Sea Company\r\nfor the use of the public.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Godolphin was removed from his employment, he left a\r\ndebt upon the navy of ---- millions,[9] all contracted under his\r\nadministration,[10] which had no Parliament-security, and was daily\r\nincreased. Neither could I ever learn, whether that lord had the\r\nsmallest prospect of clearing this incumbrance, or whether there were\r\npolicy, negligence, or despair at the bottom of this unaccountable\r\nmanagement. But the consequences were visible and ruinous; for by this\r\nmeans navy-bills grew to be forty _per cent_. discount, and upwards; and\r\nalmost every kind of stores, bought by the navy and victualling offices,\r\ncost the government double rates, and sometimes more: so that the public\r\nhath directly lost several millions upon this one article, without any\r\nsort of necessity, that I could ever hear assigned by the ablest\r\nvindicators of that party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: \"Of      millions\" in original. \"Of ---- millions\" in 1775.\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See \"The Examiner,\" No. 45, and note in vol. ix. of this\r\nedition, p. 295. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nIn this oppressed and entangled state was the kingdom, with relation to\r\nits debts, when the Queen removed the Earl of Godolphin from his office,\r\nand put it into commission, of which the present treasurer was one. This\r\nperson had been chosen speaker successively to three Parliaments, was\r\nafterwards secretary of state, and always in great esteem with the Queen\r\nfor his wisdom and fidelity. The late ministry, about two years before\r\ntheir fall, had prevailed with Her Majesty, much against her\r\ninclination, to dismiss him from her service; for which they cannot be\r\njustly blamed, since he had endeavoured the same thing against them, and\r\nvery narrowly failed; which makes it the more extraordinary that he\r\nshould succeed in a second attempt against those very adversaries, who\r\nhad such fair warning by the first. He is firm and steady in his\r\nresolutions, not easily diverted from them after he hath once possessed\r\nhimself of an opinion that they are right, nor very communicative where\r\nhe can act by himself, being taught by experience, that a secret is\r\nseldom safe in more than one breast. That which occurs to other men\r\nafter mature deliberation, offers to him as his first thoughts; so that\r\nhe decides immediately what is best to be done, and therefore is seldom\r\nat a loss upon sudden exigencies. He thinks it a more easy and safe rule\r\nin politics to watch incidents as they come, and then turn them to the\r\nadvantage of what he pursues, than pretend to foresee them at a great\r\ndistance. Fear, cruelty, avarice, and pride, are wholly strangers to his\r\nnature; but he is not without ambition. There is one thing peculiar in\r\nhis temper, which I altogether disapprove, and do not remember to have\r\nheard or met with in any other man's character: I mean, an easiness and\r\nindifference under any imputation, although he be never so innocent, and\r\nalthough the strongest probabilities and appearance are against him; so\r\nthat I have known him often suspected by his nearest friends, for some\r\nmonths, in points of the highest importance, to a degree, that they were\r\nready to break with him, and only undeceived by time and accident. His\r\ndetractors, who charge him with cunning, are but ill acquainted with his\r\ncharacter; for, in the sense they take the word, and as it is usually\r\nunderstood, I know no man to whom that mean talent could be with less\r\njustice applied, as the conduct of affairs, while he hath been at the\r\nhelm, doth clearly demonstrate, very contrary to the nature and\r\nprinciples of cunning, which is always employed in serving little turns,\r\nproposing little ends, and supplying daily exigencies by little shifts\r\nand expedients. But to rescue a prince out of the hands of insolent\r\nsubjects, bent upon such designs as must probably end in the ruin of the\r\ngovernment; to find out means for paying such exorbitant debts as this\r\nnation hath been involved in, and reduce it to a better management; to\r\nmake a potent enemy offer advantageous terms of peace, and deliver up\r\nthe most important fortress of his kingdom, as a security;[11] and this\r\nagainst all the opposition, mutually raised and inflamed by parties and\r\nallies; such performances can only be called cunning by those whose want\r\nof understanding, or of candour, puts them upon finding ill names for\r\ngreat qualities of the mind, which themselves do neither possess, nor\r\ncan form any just conception of. However, it must be allowed, that an\r\nobstinate love of secrecy in this minister seems, at distance, to have\r\nsome resemblance of cunning; for he is not only very retentive of\r\nsecrets, but appears to be so too, which I number amongst his defects.\r\nHe hath been blamed by his friends for refusing to discover his\r\nintentions, even in those points where the wisest man may have need of\r\nadvice and assistance, and some have censured him, upon that account, as\r\nif he were jealous of power but he hath been heard to answer, \"That he\r\nseldom did otherwise, without cause to repent\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This is surely a piece of Swift's partiality for Oxford;\r\nsince it practically deprives Bolingbroke of whatever credit was his for\r\nthe Peace of Utrecht, and that was not a little; certainly more than may\r\nbe given to Oxford. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHowever, so undistinguished a caution cannot, in my opinion, be\r\njustified, by which the owner loseth many advantages, and whereof all\r\nmen, who deserved to be confided in, may with some reason complain. His\r\nlove of procrastination (wherein doubtless nature hath her share) may\r\nprobably be increased by the same means, but this is an imputation laid\r\nupon many other great ministers, who, like men under too heavy a load,\r\nlet fall that which is of the least consequence, and go back to fetch it\r\nwhen their shoulders are free, for time is often gained, as well as\r\nlost, by delay, which at worst is a fault on the securer side.[12]\r\nNeither probably is this minister answerable for half the clamour raised\r\nagainst him upon that article: his endeavours are wholly turned upon the\r\ngeneral welfare of his country, but perhaps with too little regard to\r\nthat of particular persons, which renders him less amiable, than he\r\nwould otherwise have been from the goodness of his humour, and agreeable\r\nconversation in a private capacity, and with few dependers. Yet some\r\nallowance may perhaps be given to this failing, which is one of the\r\ngreatest he hath, since he cannot be more careless of other men's\r\nfortunes than he is of his own. He is master of a very great and\r\nfaithful memory, which is of mighty use in the management of public\r\naffairs; and I believe there are few examples to be produced in any age,\r\nof a person who hath passed through so many employments in the state,\r\nendowed with a great share, both of divine and human learning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Unfortunately, procrastination too often ended for Harley\r\nin very unpleasant results, and it is not too much to say, this failing\r\nwas the indirect cause of his downfall. Swift's character of Oxford, as\r\ngiven in this \"History,\" should be compared with that given of him in\r\n\"An Enquiry into the Behaviour of the Queen's Last Ministry\" (vol v, pp\r\n431-434, of present edition). Dr William King, to whom Swift had written\r\nin 1736, for certain dates and official extracts to be included in this\r\n\"History,\" wrote to Swift (December 7th, 1736), referring to this very\r\nmatter of Oxford's character. As the letter applies to some other\r\nportions of this \"History,\" it will be better if it be given here.\r\n\r\n\"London, December 7th, 1736\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI arrived here yesterday [King had been on a visit to Paris], and I am\r\nnow ready to obey your commands. I hope you are come to a positive\r\nresolution concerning the History. You need not hesitate about the\r\ndates, or the references which are to be made to any public papers, for\r\nI can supply them without the least trouble. As well as I remember,\r\nthere is but one of those public pieces which you determined should be\r\ninserted at length; I mean Sir Thomas Hanmer's Representation; this I\r\nhave now by me. If you incline to publish the two tracts as an Appendix\r\nto the History, you will be pleased to see if the character given of the\r\nEarl of Oxford in the pamphlet of 1715 agrees with the character given\r\nof the same person in the History. Perhaps on a review, you may think\r\nproper to leave one of them quite out. You have (I think) barely\r\nmentioned the attempt of Guiscard, and the quarrel between Rechteren and\r\nMesnager. But as these are facts which are probably now forgot or\r\nunknown, it would not be amiss if they were related at large in the\r\nnotes, which may be done from the Gazettes, or any other newspapers of\r\nthose times,\" etc. See Sir W. Scott's edit, vol xix, pp 20-21 [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that foreigners, as well as those at home, who live too\r\nremote from the scene of business to be rightly informed, will not be\r\ndispleased with this account of a person, who in the space of two years,\r\nhath been so highly instrumental in changing the face of affairs in\r\nEurope, and hath deserved so well of his own Prince and country.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See also Swift's \"Enquiry\" (vol. v., pp. 425-476).\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nIn that perplexed condition of the public debts, which I have already\r\ndescribed, this minister was brought into the treasury and exchequer,\r\nand had the chief direction of affairs. His first regulation was that of\r\nexchequer bills, which, to the great discouragement of public credit,\r\nand scandal to the crown, were three _per cent._ less in value than the\r\nsums specified in them. The present treasurer, being then chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer, procured an Act of Parliament, by which the Bank of\r\nEngland should be obliged, in consideration of forty-five thousand\r\npounds, to accept and circulate those bills without any discount. He\r\nthen proceeded to stop the depredations of those who dealt in\r\nremittances of money to the army, who, by unheard of exactions in that\r\nkind of traffic, had amassed prodigious wealth at the public cost, to\r\nwhich the Earl of Godolphin had given too much way,[14] _possibly by\r\nneglect; for I think he cannot be accused of corruption_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Added in the author's own handwriting. [ORIGINAL NOTE.] P.\r\nFitzgerald gives the addition as \"either through ignorance, connivance,\r\nor neglect.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nBut the new treasurer's chief concern was to restore the credit of the\r\nnation, by finding some settlement for unprovided debts, amounting in\r\nthe whole to ten millions, which hung on the public as a load equally\r\nheavy and disgraceful, without any prospect of being removed, and which\r\nformer ministers never had the care or courage to inspect. He resolved\r\nto go at once to the bottom of this evil; and having computed and summed\r\nup the debt of the navy, and victualling, ordnance, and transport of the\r\narmy, and transport debentures made out for the service of the last war,\r\nof the general mortgage tallies for the year one thousand seven hundred\r\nand ten, and some other deficiencies, he then found out a fund of\r\ninterest sufficient to answer all this, which, being applied to other\r\nuses, could not raise present money for the war, but in a very few years\r\nwould clear the debt it was engaged for. The intermediate accruing\r\ninterest was to be paid by the treasurer of the navy; and, as a farther\r\nadvantage to the creditors, they should be erected into a company for\r\ntrading to the South Seas, and for encouragement of fishery. When all\r\nthis was fully prepared and digested, he made a motion in the House of\r\nCommons (who deferred extremely to his judgment and abilities) for\r\npaying the debts of the navy, and other unprovided deficiencies, without\r\nentering into particulars, which was immediately voted. But a sudden\r\nstop was put to this affair by an unforeseen accident. The chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer (which was then his title) being stabbed with a penknife,\r\nthe following day, at the Cockpit, in the midst of a dozen lords of the\r\ncouncil, by the Sieur de Guiscard, a French papist; the circumstances of\r\nwhich fact being not within the compass of this History, I shall only\r\nobserve, that after two months' confinement, and frequent danger of his\r\nlife, he returned to his seat in Parliament.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See the particular account in \"The Examiner.\" [ORIGINAL\r\nNOTE.] The reference is to Nos. 33, 41, and 42 of that paper (see vol.\r\nix, of this edition). [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe overtures made by this minister, of paying so vast a debt, under the\r\npressures of a long war, and the difficulty of finding supplies for\r\ncontinuing it, was, during the time of his illness, ridiculed by his\r\nenemies as an impracticable and visionary project: and when, upon his\r\nreturn to the House, he had explained his proposal, the very proprietors\r\nof the debt were, many of them, prevailed on to oppose it; although the\r\nobtaining this trade, either through Old Spain, or directly to the\r\nSpanish West Indies, had been one principal end we aimed at by this war.\r\nHowever, the bill passed; and, as an immediate consequence, the naval\r\nbills rose to about twenty _per cent_., nor ever fell within ten of\r\ntheir discount. Another good effect of this work appeared by the\r\nparliamentary lotteries, which have been since erected. The last of that\r\nkind, under the former ministry, was eleven weeks in filling; whereas\r\nthe first, under the present, was filled in a very few hours, although\r\nit cost the government less; and the others, which followed, were full\r\nbefore the Acts concerning them could pass. And to prevent incumbrances\r\nof this kind from growing for the future, he took care, by the utmost\r\nparsimony, or by suspending payments, where they seemed less to press,\r\nthat all stores for the navy should be bought with ready money; by which\r\n_cent. per cent._ hath been saved in that mighty article of our expense,\r\nas will appear from an account taken at the victualling office on the\r\n9th of August, one thousand seven hundred and twelve. And the payment of\r\nthe interest was less a burthen upon the navy, by the stores being\r\nbought at so cheap a rate.\r\n\r\nIt might look invidious to enter into farther particulars upon this\r\nhead, but of smaller moment. What I have above related, may serve to\r\nshew in how ill a condition the kingdom stood, with relation to its\r\ndebts, by the corruption as well as negligence of former management; and\r\nwhat prudent, effectual measures have since been taken to provide for\r\nold incumbrances, and hinder the running into new. This may be\r\nsufficient for the information of the reader, perhaps already tired with\r\na subject so little entertaining as that of accounts: I shall therefore\r\nnow return to relate some of the principal matters that passed in\r\nParliament, during this session.\r\n\r\nUpon the eighteenth of January the House of Lords sent down a bill to\r\nthe Commons, for fixing the precedence of the Hanover family, which\r\nprobably had been forgot in the Acts for settling the succession of the\r\ncrown. That of Henry VIII. which gives the rank to princes of the blood,\r\ncarries it no farther than to nephews, nieces, and grandchildren of the\r\ncrown, by virtue of which the Princess Sophia is a princess of the\r\nblood, as niece to King Charles I of England, and precedes accordingly,\r\nbut this privilege doth not descend to her son the Elector, or the\r\nelectoral prince. To supply which defect, and pay a compliment to the\r\npresumptive heirs of the crown, this bill, as appeareth by the preamble,\r\nwas recommended by Her Majesty to the House of Lords, which the Commons,\r\nto shew their zeal for every thing that might be thought to concern the\r\ninterest or honour of that illustrious family, ordered to be read thrice,\r\npassed _nemine contradicente_ and returned to the Lords, without any\r\namendment, on the very day it was sent down.\r\n\r\nBut the House seemed to have nothing more at heart than a strict inquiry\r\ninto the state of the nation, with respect to foreign alliances. Some\r\ndiscourses had been published in print, about the beginning of the\r\nsession, boldly complaining of certain articles in the Barrier Treaty,\r\nconcluded about three years since by the Lord Viscount Townshend,\r\nbetween Great Britain and the States General, and shewing, in many\r\nparticulars, the unequal conduct of these powers in our alliance, in\r\nfurnishing their quotas and supplies. It was asserted by the same\r\nwriters, \"That these hardships, put upon England, had been countenanced\r\nand encouraged by a party here at home, in order to preserve their\r\npower, which could be no otherwise maintained than by continuing the\r\nwar, as well as by Her Majesty's general abroad, upon account of his own\r\npeculiar interest and grandeur.\" These loud accusations spreading\r\nthemselves throughout the kingdom, delivered in facts directly charged,\r\nand thought, whether true or not, to be but weakly confuted, had\r\nsufficiently prepared the minds of the people, and, by putting arguments\r\ninto every body's mouth, had filled the town and country with\r\ncontroversies, both in writing and discourse. The point appeared to be\r\nof great consequence, whether the war continued or not for, in the\r\nformer case, it was necessary that the allies should be brought to a\r\nmore equal regulation, and that the States in particular, for whom Her\r\nMajesty had done such great things, should explain and correct those\r\narticles in the Barrier Treaty which were prejudicial to Britain, and,\r\nin either case, it was fit the people should have at least the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing by whose counsels, and for what designs, they\r\nhad been so hardly treated.\r\n\r\nIn order to this great inquiry, the Barrier Treaty, with all other\r\ntreaties and agreements entered into between Her Majesty and her allies,\r\nduring the present war, for the raising and augmenting the proportions\r\nfor the service thereof, were, by the Queen's directions, laid before\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nSeveral resolutions were drawn up, and reported at different times, upon\r\nthe deficiencies of the allies in furnishing their quotas, upon certain\r\narticles in the Barrier Treaty, and upon the state of the war; by all\r\nwhich it appeared, that whatever had been charged by public discourses\r\nin print against the late ministry, and the conduct of the allies, was\r\nmuch less than the truth. Upon these resolutions (by one of which the\r\nLord Viscount Townshend, who negotiated and signed the Barrier Treaty,\r\nwas declared an enemy to the Queen and kingdom), and upon some farther\r\ndirections to the committee, a Representation was formed; and soon after\r\nthe Commons in a body presented it to the Queen, the endeavours of the\r\nadverse party not prevailing to have it re-committed.\r\n\r\nThis Representation (supposed to be the work of Sir Thomas Hanmer's[16]\r\npen) is written with much energy and spirit, and will be a very useful\r\nauthentic record, for the assistance of those who at any time shall\r\nundertake to write the history of the present times.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: But to which the Dean himself contributed a large share.\r\n[S.] Swift writes in his \"Journal,\" under date February 21st: \"I left\r\nthem at 7, being engaged to go to Sir Tho. Hanmer, who desired I would\r\nsee him at that hour. His business was, that I would help him to draw up\r\nthe representation, which I consented to do\" (vol. ii., p. 340). [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nI did intend, for brevity sake, to have given the reader only an\r\nabstract of it; but, upon trial, found myself unequal to such a task,\r\nwithout injuring so excellent a piece. And although I think historical\r\nrelations are but ill patched up with long transcripts already printed,\r\nwhich, upon that account, I have hitherto avoided; yet this being the\r\nsum of all debates and resolutions of the House of Commons in that great\r\naffair of the war, I conceived it could not well be omitted.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: This \"Representation\" was printed by S. Keble by order of\r\nthe Speaker, and is also to be found in the \"Journals of the House of\r\nCommons,\" vol. xvii., pp. 119-123. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\"MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,\r\n\r\n\"We your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Great\r\nBritain in Parliament assembled, having nothing so much at heart, as to\r\nenable your Majesty to bring this long and expensive war to an\r\nhonourable and happy conclusion, have taken it into our most serious\r\nconsideration, how the necessary supplies to be provided by us may be\r\nbest applied, and the common cause may in the most effectual manner be\r\ncarried on, by the united force of the whole confederacy; we have\r\nthought ourselves obliged, in duty to your Majesty, and in discharge of\r\nthe trust reposed in us, to inquire into the true state of the war, in\r\nall its parts; we have examined what stipulations have been entered into\r\nbetween your Majesty and your allies; and how far such engagements have\r\non each side been made good. We have considered the different interests\r\nwhich the confederates have in the success of this war, and the\r\ndifferent shares they have contributed to its support: we have with our\r\nutmost care and diligence endeavoured to discover the nature, extent,\r\nand charge of it, to the end, that by comparing the weight thereof with\r\nour own strength, we might adapt the one to the other in such measure,\r\nas neither to continue your Majesty's subjects under a heavier burden,\r\nthan in reason and justice they ought to bear; nor deceive your Majesty,\r\nyour allies, and ourselves, by undertaking more than the nation in its\r\npresent circumstances is able to perform.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty has been graciously pleased, upon our humble applications,\r\nto order such materials to be laid before us, as have furnished us with\r\nthe necessary information upon the particulars we have inquired into;\r\nand when we shall have laid before your Majesty our observations, and\r\nhumble advice upon this subject, we promise to ourselves this happy\r\nfruit from it, that if your Majesty's generous and good purposes, for\r\nthe procuring a safe and lasting peace, should, through the obstinacy of\r\nthe enemy, or by any other means, be unhappily defeated, a true\r\nknowledge and understanding of the past conduct of the war will be the\r\nbest foundation for a more frugal and equal management of it for the\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\n\"In order to take the more perfect view of what we proposed, and that we\r\nmight be able to set the whole before your Majesty in a true light, we\r\nhave thought it necessary to go back to the beginning of the war, and\r\nbeg leave to observe the motives and reasons, upon which his late\r\nMajesty King William engaged first in it. The treaty of the Grand\r\nAlliance, explains those reasons to be for the supporting the\r\npretensions of his Imperial Majesty, then actually engaged in a war with\r\nthe French King, who had usurped the entire Spanish monarchy for his\r\ngrandson the Duke of Anjou; and for the assisting the States General,\r\nwho, by the loss of their barrier against France, were then in the same,\r\nor a more dangerous condition, than if they were actually invaded. As\r\nthese were the just and necessary motives for undertaking this war, so\r\nthe ends proposed to be obtained by it, were equally wise and\r\nhonourable; for as they are set forth in the eighth article of the same\r\ntreaty, they appear to have been _the procuring an equitable and\r\nreasonable satisfaction to his Imperial Majesty, and sufficient\r\nsecurities for the dominions, provinces, navigation, and commerce of the\r\nKing of Great Britain, and the States General, and the making effectual\r\nprovision, that the two kingdoms of France and Spain should never be\r\nunited under the same government;_ and particularly, that the French\r\nshould never get into the possession of the Spanish West Indies, or be\r\npermitted to sail thither, upon the account of traffic, under any\r\npretence whatsoever; and lastly, the securing to the subjects of the\r\nKing of Great Britain, and the States General, all the same privileges,\r\nand rights of commerce, throughout the whole dominions of Spain, as they\r\nenjoyed before the death of Charles the Second King of Spain, by virtue\r\nof any treaty, agreement, or custom, or any other way whatsoever. For\r\nthe obtaining these ends, the three confederated powers engaged to\r\nassist one another with their whole force, according to such proportions\r\nas should be specified in a particular convention, afterwards to be made\r\nfor that purpose: we do not find that any such convention was ever\r\nratified; but it appears, that there was an agreement concluded, which,\r\nby common consent, was understood to be binding upon each party\r\nrespectively, and according to which the proportions of Great Britain\r\nwere from the beginning regulated and founded. The terms of that\r\nagreement were, That for the service at land, his Imperial Majesty\r\nshould furnish ninety thousand men, the King of Great Britain forty\r\nthousand, and the States General one hundred and two thousand, of which\r\nthere were forty-two thousand intended to supply their garrisons, and\r\nsixty thousand to act against the common enemy in the field; and with\r\nregard to the operations of the war at sea, they were agreed to be\r\nperformed jointly by Great Britain and the States General, the quota of\r\nships to be furnished for that service being five-eighths on the part of\r\nGreat Britain, and three-eighths on the part of the States General.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this foot, the war began in the year one thousand seven hundred\r\nand two, at which time the whole yearly expense of it to England\r\namounted to three millions, seven hundred and six thousand four hundred\r\nninety-four pounds; a very great charge, as it was then thought by your\r\nMajesty's subjects, after the short interval of ease they had enjoyed\r\nfrom the burden of the former war, but yet a very moderate proportion,\r\nin comparison with the load which hath since been laid upon them: for it\r\nappears, by estimates given in to your Commons, that the sums necessary\r\nto carry on the service for this present year, in the same manner as it\r\nwas performed the last year, amount to more than six millions nine\r\nhundred and sixty thousand pounds, besides interest for the public\r\ndebts, and the deficiencies accruing the last year, which two articles\r\nrequire one million one hundred and forty-three thousand pounds more: so\r\nthat the whole demands upon your Commons are arisen to more than eight\r\nmillions for the present annual supply. We know your Majesty's tender\r\nregard for the welfare of your people, will make it uneasy to you to\r\nhear of so great a pressure as this upon them; and as we are assured, it\r\nwill fully convince your Majesty of the necessity of our present\r\ninquiry; so we beg leave to represent to you, from what causes, and by\r\nwhat steps, this immense charge appears to have grown upon us.\r\n\r\n\"The service at sea, as it has been very large and extensive in itself,\r\nso it has been carried on, through the whole course of the war, in a\r\nmanner highly disadvantageous to your Majesty and your kingdom: for the\r\nnecessity of affairs requiring that great fleets should be fitted out\r\nevery year, as well for the maintaining a superiority in the\r\nMediterranean, as for opposing any force which the enemy might prepare,\r\neither at Dunkirk, or in the ports of West France, your Majesty's\r\nexample and readiness in fitting out your proportion of ships, for all\r\nparts of that service, have been so far from prevailing with the States\r\nGeneral to keep pace with you, that they have been deficient every year\r\nto a great degree, in proportion to what your Majesty hath furnished;\r\nsometimes no less than two-thirds, and generally more than half of their\r\nquota: from hence your Majesty has been obliged, for the preventing\r\ndisappointments in the most pressing services, to supply those\r\ndeficiencies by additional reinforcements of your own ships; nor hath\r\nthe single increase of such a charge been the only ill consequence that\r\nattended it; for by this means the debt of the navy hath been enhanced,\r\nso that the discounts arising upon the credit of it have affected all\r\nother parts of the service. From the same cause, your Majesty's ships of\r\nwar have been forced in greater numbers to continue in remote seas, and\r\nat unseasonable times of the year, to the great damage and decay of the\r\nBritish navy. This also hath been the occasion that your Majesty hath\r\nbeen straitened in your convoys for trade; your coasts have been\r\nexposed, for want of a sufficient number of cruisers to guard them; and\r\nyou have been disabled from annoying the enemy, in their most beneficial\r\ncommerce with the West Indies, from whence they received those vast\r\nsupplies of treasure, without which they could not have supported the\r\nexpenses of this war.\r\n\r\n\"That part of the war which hath been carried on in Flanders, was at\r\nfirst immediately necessary to the security of the States General, and\r\nhath since brought them great acquisitions, both of revenue and\r\ndominion; yet even there the original proportions have been departed\r\nfrom, and, during the course of the war, have been sinking by degrees on\r\nthe part of Holland; so that in this last year, we find the number in\r\nwhich they fell short of their three-fifths, to your Majesty's\r\ntwo-fifths, have been twenty thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven\r\nmen: we are not unmindful, that in the year one thousand seven hundred\r\nand three, a treaty was made between the two nations, for a joint\r\naugmentation of twenty thousand men, wherein the proportions were\r\nvaried, and England consented to take half upon itself. But it having\r\nbeen annexed as an express condition to the grant of the said\r\naugmentation in Parliament, that the States General should prohibit all\r\ntrade and commerce with France, and that condition having not been\r\nperformed by them, the Commons think it reasonable, that the first rule\r\nof three to two ought to have taken place again, as well in that as in\r\nother subsequent augmentations, more especially when they consider, that\r\nthe revenues of those rich provinces which have been conquered, would,\r\nif they were duly applied, maintain a great number of new additional\r\nforces against the common enemy; notwithstanding which, the States\r\nGeneral have raised none upon that account, but make use of those fresh\r\nsupplies of money, only to ease themselves in the charge of their first\r\nestablished quota.\r\n\r\n\"As in the progress of the war in Flanders, a disproportion was soon\r\ncreated to the prejudice of England; so the very beginning of the war in\r\nPortugal, brought an unequal share of burden upon us; for although the\r\nEmperor and the States General were equally parties with your Majesty in\r\nthe treaty with the King of Portugal, yet the Emperor neither furnishing\r\nhis third part of the troops and subsidies stipulated for, nor the Dutch\r\nconsenting to take an equal share of his Imperial Majesty's defect upon\r\nthemselves, your Majesty hath been obliged to furnish two-thirds of the\r\nentire expense created by that service. Nor has the inequality stopped\r\nthere; for ever since the year one thousand seven hundred and six, when\r\nthe English and Dutch forces marched out of Portugal into Castile, the\r\nStates General have entirely abandoned the war in Portugal, and left\r\nyour Majesty to prosecute it singly at your own charge, which you have\r\naccordingly done, by replacing a greater number of troops there, than\r\neven at first you took upon you to provide. At the same time your\r\nMajesty's generous endeavours for the support and defence of the King of\r\nPortugal, have been but ill seconded by that Prince himself; for\r\nnotwithstanding that by his treaty he had obliged himself to furnish\r\ntwelve thousand foot, and three thousand horse, upon his own account,\r\nbesides eleven thousand foot, and two thousand horse more, in\r\nconsideration of a subsidy paid him; yet, according to the best\r\ninformation your Commons can procure, it appears, that he hath scarce at\r\nany time furnished thirteen thousand men in the whole.\r\n\r\n\"In Spain the war hath been yet more unequal, and burdensome to your\r\nMajesty, than in any other branch of it; for being commenced without any\r\ntreaty whatsoever, the allies have almost wholly declined taking any\r\npart of it upon themselves. A small body of English and Dutch troops\r\nwere sent thither in the year one thousand seven hundred and five, not\r\nas being thought sufficient to support a regular war, or to make the\r\nconquest of so large a country; but with a view only of assisting the\r\nSpaniards to set King Charles upon the throne; occasioned by the great\r\nassurances which were given of their inclinations to the House of\r\nAustria: but this expectation failing, England was insensibly drawn into\r\nan established war, under all the disadvantages of the distance of the\r\nplace, and the feeble efforts of the other allies. The account we have\r\nto lay before your Majesty, upon this head, is, that although the\r\nundertaking was entered upon at the particular and earnest request of\r\nthe imperial court, and for a cause of no less importance and concern to\r\nthem, than the reducing the Spanish monarchy to the House of Austria;\r\nyet neither the late emperors, nor his present Imperial Majesty, have\r\never had any forces there on their own account, till the last year; and\r\nthen, only one regiment of foot, consisting of two thousand men. Though\r\nthe States General have contributed something more to this service, yet\r\ntheir share also hath been inconsiderable; for in the space of four\r\nyears, from one thousand seven hundred and five, to one thousand seven\r\nhundred and eight, both inclusive, all the forces they have sent into\r\nthat country have not exceeded twelve thousand two hundred men; and from\r\nthe year one thousand seven hundred and eight to this time, they have\r\nnot sent any forces or recruits whatsoever. To your Majesty's care and\r\ncharge the recovery of that kingdom hath been in a manner wholly left,\r\nas if none else were interested or concerned in it. And the forces which\r\nyour Majesty hath sent into Spain, in the space of seven years, from one\r\nthousand seven hundred and five to one thousand seven hundred and\r\neleven, both inclusive, have amounted to no less than fifty-seven\r\nthousand nine hundred seventy-three men; besides thirteen battalions and\r\neighteen squadrons, for which your Majesty hath paid a subsidy to the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\n\"How great the established expense of such a number of men hath been,\r\nyour Majesty very well knows, and your Commons very sensibly feel; but\r\nthe weight will be found much greater, when it is considered how many\r\nheavy articles of unusual and extraordinary charge have attended this\r\nremote and difficult service, all which have been entirely defrayed by\r\nyour Majesty, except that one of transporting the few forces, which were\r\nsent by the States General, and the victualling of them during their\r\ntransportation only. The accounts delivered to your Commons shew, that\r\nthe charge of your Majesty's ships and vessels, employed in the service\r\nof the war in Spain and Portugal, reckoned after the rate of four pounds\r\na man _per_ month, from the time they sailed from hence, till they\r\nreturned, were lost, or put upon other services, hath amounted to six\r\nmillions five hundred and forty thousand nine hundred and sixty-six\r\npounds fourteen shillings: the charge of transports on the part of Great\r\nBritain, for carrying on the war in Spain and Portugal, from the\r\nbeginning of it till this time, hath amounted to one million three\r\nhundred thirty-six thousand seven hundred and nineteen pounds, nineteen\r\nshillings, and elevenpence; that of victualling land forces for the same\r\nservice, to five hundred eighty-three thousand seven hundred and seventy\r\npounds, eight shillings, and sixpence; and that of contingencies, and\r\nother extraordinaries for the same service, to one million eight hundred\r\nand forty thousand three hundred and fifty-three pounds.\r\n\r\n\"We should take notice to your Majesty of several sums paid upon account\r\nof contingencies, and extraordinaries in Flanders, making together the\r\nsum of one million one hundred and seven thousand and ninety-six pounds:\r\nbut we are not able to make any comparison of them, with what the States\r\nGeneral have expended upon the same head, having no such state of their\r\nextraordinary charge before us. There remains therefore but one\r\nparticular more for your Majesty's observation, which arises from the\r\nsubsidies paid to foreign princes. These, at the beginning of the war,\r\nwere borne in equal proportion by your Majesty, and the States General;\r\nbut in this instance also, the balance hath been cast in prejudice of\r\nyour Majesty: for it appears, that your Majesty hath since advanced more\r\nthan your equal proportion, three millions one hundred and fifty-five\r\nthousand crowns[18], besides extraordinaries paid in Italy, and not\r\nincluded in any of the foregoing articles, which arise to five hundred\r\nthirty-nine thousand five hundred and fifty-three pounds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: In the \"Journals of the House of Commons,\" vol. xvii., p.\r\n48, is an exact state of all the subsidies and extra expenses, from 1702\r\nto 1711. [N.]]\r\n\r\n\"We have laid these several particulars before your Majesty in the\r\nshortest manner we have been able; and by an estimate grounded on the\r\npreceding facts, it does appear, that over and above the quotas on the\r\npart of Great Britain, answering to those contributed by your allies,\r\nmore than nineteen millions have been expended by your Majesty, during\r\nthe course of this war, by way of surplusage, or exceeding in balance,\r\nof which none of the confederates have furnished any thing whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\"It is with very great concern, that we find so much occasion given us,\r\nto represent how ill an use hath been made of your Majesty's and your\r\nsubjects' zeal for the common cause; that the interest of that cause\r\nhath not been proportionably promoted by it, but others only have been\r\neased at your Majesty's and your subjects' costs, and have been connived\r\nat, in laying their part of the burden upon this kingdom, although they\r\nhave upon all accounts been equally, and in most respects, much more\r\nnearly concerned than Britain in the issue of the war. We are persuaded\r\nyour Majesty will think it pardonable in us, with some resentment to\r\ncomplain of the little regard, which some of those, whom your Majesty of\r\nlate years intrusted, have shewn to the interests of their country, in\r\ngiving way, at least, to such unreasonable impositions upon it, if not\r\nin some measure contriving them. The course of which impositions hath\r\nbeen so singular and extraordinary, that the more the wealth of this\r\nnation hath been exhausted, and the more your Majesty's arms have been\r\nattended with success, the heavier hath been the burden laid upon us;\r\nwhilst on the other hand, the more vigorous your Majesty's efforts have\r\nbeen, and the greater the advantages which have redounded thence to your\r\nallies, the more those allies have abated in their share of the expense.\r\n\r\n\"At the first entrance into this war, the Commons were induced to exert\r\nthemselves in the extraordinary manner they did, and to grant such large\r\nsupplies, as had been unknown to former ages, in hopes thereby to\r\nprevent the mischiefs of a lingering war, and to bring that, in which\r\nthey were necessarily engaged, to a speedy conclusion; but they have\r\nbeen very unhappy in the event, whilst they have so much reason to\r\nsuspect, that what was intended to shorten the war, hath proved the very\r\ncause of its long continuance; for those, to whom the profits of it have\r\naccrued, have been disposed not easily to forgo them. And your Majesty\r\nwill from thence discern _the true reason, why so many have delighted in\r\na war, which brought in so rich an harvest yearly from Great Britain_.\r\n\r\n\"We are as far from desiring, as we know your Majesty will be from\r\nconcluding any peace, but upon safe and honourable terms; and we are far\r\nfrom intending to excuse ourselves from raising all necessary and\r\npossible supplies, for an effectual prosecution of the war, till such a\r\npeace can be obtained: all that your faithful Commons aim at, all that\r\nthey wish, is an equal concurrence from the other powers, engaged in\r\nalliance with your Majesty; and a just application of what hath been\r\nalready gained from the enemy, towards promoting the common cause.\r\nSeveral large countries and territories have been restored to the house\r\nof Austria, such as the kingdom of Naples, the duchy of Milan, and other\r\nplaces in Italy; others have been conquered, and added to their\r\ndominions, as the two electorates of Bavaria and Cologne, the duchy of\r\nMantua, and the bishopric of Liège; these having been reduced in great\r\nmeasure by our blood and treasure, may, we humbly conceive, with great\r\nreason, be claimed to come in aid towards carrying on the war in Spain.\r\nAnd therefore we make it our earnest request to your Majesty, that you\r\nwill give instructions to your ministers, to insist with the Emperor,\r\nthat the revenues of those several places, excepting only such a portion\r\nthereof as is necessary for their defence, be actually so applied: and\r\nas to the other parts of the war, to which your Majesty hath obliged\r\nyourself by particular treaties to contribute, we humbly beseech your\r\nMajesty, that you will be pleased to take effectual care, that your\r\nallies do perform their parts stipulated by those treaties; and that\r\nyour Majesty will, for the future, no otherwise furnish troops, or pay\r\nsubsidies, than in proportion to what your allies shall actually furnish\r\nand pay. When this justice is done to your Majesty, and to your people,\r\nthere is nothing which your Commons will not cheerfully grant, towards\r\nsupporting your Majesty in the cause in which you are engaged. And\r\nwhatever farther shall appear to be necessary for carrying on the war,\r\neither at sea or land, we will effectually enable your Majesty to bear\r\nyour reasonable share of any such expense, and will spare no supplies\r\nwhich your subjects are able, with their utmost efforts to afford.\r\n\r\n\"After having enquired into, and considered the state of the war, in\r\nwhich the part your Majesty has borne, appears to have been, not only\r\nsuperior to that of any one ally, but even equal to that of the whole\r\nconfederacy; your Commons naturally inclined to hope, that they should\r\nfind care had been taken of securing some particular advantages to\r\nBritain, in the terms of a future peace; such as might afford a prospect\r\nof making the nation amends, in time, for that immense treasure which\r\nhas been expended, and those heavy debts which have been contracted, in\r\nthe course of so long and burdensome a war. This reasonable expectation\r\ncould no way have been better answered, than by some provision made for\r\nthe further security, and the greater improvement of the commerce of\r\nGreat Britain; but we find ourselves so very far disappointed in these\r\nhopes, that in a treaty not long since concluded between your Majesty\r\nand the States General, under colour of a mutual guarantee, given for\r\ntwo points of the greatest importance to both nations, the Succession,\r\nand the Barrier; it appears, the interest of Great Britain hath been not\r\nonly neglected, but sacrificed; and that several articles in the said\r\ntreaty, are destructive to the trade and welfare of this kingdom, and\r\ntherefore highly dishonourable to your Majesty.\r\n\r\n\"Your Commons observe, in the first place, that several towns and places\r\nare, by virtue of this treaty, to be put into the hands of the States\r\nGeneral, particularly Nieuport, Dendermonde, and the castle of Ghent,\r\nwhich can in no sense be looked upon as part of a barrier against\r\nFrance, but being the keys of the Netherlands towards Britain, must make\r\nthe trade of your Majesty's subjects in those parts precarious, and\r\nwhenever the States think fit, totally exclude them from it. The\r\npretended necessity of putting these places into the hands of the States\r\nGeneral, in order to secure to them a communication with their barrier,\r\nmust appear vain and groundless; for the sovereignty of the Low\r\nCountries being not to remain to an enemy, but to a friend and an ally,\r\nthat communication must be always secure and uninterrupted; besides\r\nthat, in case of a rupture, or any attack, the States have full liberty\r\nallowed them to take possession of all the Spanish Netherlands, and\r\ntherefore needed no particular stipulation for the towns above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\"Having taken notice of this concession made to the States General, for\r\nseizing upon the whole ten provinces; we cannot but observe to your\r\nMajesty, that in the manner this article is framed, it is another\r\ndangerous circumstance which attends this treaty; for had such a\r\nprovision been confined to the case of an apparent attack from France\r\nonly, the avowed design of this treaty had been fulfilled, and your\r\nMajesty's instructions to your ambassador had been pursued: but this\r\nnecessary restriction hath been omitted, and the same liberty is granted\r\nto the States, to take possession of all the Netherlands, whenever they\r\nshall think themselves attacked by any other neighbouring nation, as\r\nwhen they shall be in danger from France; so that if it should at any\r\ntime happen (which your Commons are very unwilling to suppose) that they\r\nshould quarrel, even with your Majesty, the riches, strength, and\r\nadvantageous situation of these countries, may be made use of against\r\nyourself, without whose generous and powerful assistance they had never\r\nbeen conquered.\r\n\r\n\"To return to those ill consequences which relate to the trade of your\r\nkingdoms, we beg leave to observe to your Majesty, that though this\r\ntreaty revives, and renders your Majesty a party to the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth articles of the Treaty of Munster,[19] by virtue of which, the\r\nimpositions upon all goods and merchandises brought into the Spanish Low\r\nCountries by the sea, are to equal those laid on goods and merchandises\r\nimported by the Scheldt, and the canals of Sass and Swyn, and other\r\nmouths of the sea adjoining; yet no care is taken to preserve that\r\nequality upon the exportation of those goods out of the Spanish\r\nprovinces, into those countries and places, which, by virtue of this\r\ntreaty, are to be in the possession of the States; the consequence of\r\nwhich must in time be, and your Commons are informed, that in some\r\ninstances it has already proved to be the case, that the impositions\r\nupon goods carried into those countries and places, by the subjects of\r\nthe States General, will be taken off, while those upon the goods\r\nimported by your Majesty's subjects remain: by which means, Great\r\nBritain will entirely lose this most beneficial branch of trade, which\r\nit has in all ages been possessed of, even from the time when those\r\ncountries were governed by the house of Burgundy, one of the most\r\nancient, as well as the most useful allies to the crown of England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Concluded June 30th, 1643. See note in vol. v., p. 150, of\r\npresent edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the other dominions and territories of Spain, your\r\nMajesty's subjects have always been distinguished in their commerce with\r\nthem, and both by ancient treaties, and an uninterrupted custom, have\r\nenjoyed greater privileges and immunities of trade, than either the\r\nHollanders, or any other nation whatsoever. And that wise and excellent\r\ntreaty of the Grand Alliance, provides effectually for the security and\r\ncontinuance of these valuable privileges to Britain, in such a manner,\r\nas that each nation might be left, at the end of war, upon the same foot\r\nas it stood at the commencement of it: but this treaty we now complain\r\nof, instead of confirming your subjects' rights, surrenders and destroys\r\nthem; for although by the sixteenth and seventeenth articles of the\r\nTreaty of Munster, made between his Catholic Majesty and the States\r\nGeneral, all advantages of trade are stipulated for, and granted to the\r\nHollanders, equal to what the English enjoyed; yet the crown of England\r\nnot being a party to that treaty, the subjects of England have never\r\nsubmitted to those articles of it, nor even the Spaniards themselves\r\never observed them; but this treaty revives those articles in prejudice\r\nof Great Britain, and makes your Majesty a party to them, and even a\r\nguarantee to the States General, for privileges against your own people.\r\n\r\n\"In how deliberate and extraordinary a manner your Majesty's ambassador\r\nconsented to deprive your subjects of their ancient rights, and your\r\nMajesty of the power of procuring to them any new advantage, most\r\nevidently appears from his own letters, which, by your Majesty's\r\ndirections, have been laid before your Commons:[20] for when matters of\r\nadvantage to your Majesty, and to your kingdom, had been offered, as\r\nproper to be made parts of this treaty, they were refused to be admitted\r\nby the States General, upon this reason and principle, that nothing\r\nforeign to the guaranties of the Succession, and of the Barrier, should\r\nbe mingled with them; notwithstanding which, the States General had no\r\nsooner received notice of a treaty of commerce concluded between your\r\nMajesty and the present Emperor, but they departed from the rule\r\nproposed before, and insisted upon the article, of which your Commons\r\nnow complain; which article your Majesty's ambassador allowed of,\r\nalthough equally foreign to the Succession, or the Barrier; and although\r\nhe had for that reason departed from other articles, which would have\r\nbeen for the service of his own country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Printed in the \"Journals,\" vol. xvii., pp. 87-89. [N.]]\r\n\r\n\"We have forborne to trouble your Majesty with general observations upon\r\nthis treaty, as it relates to and affects the empire, and other parts of\r\nEurope. The mischiefs which arise from it to Great Britain, are what\r\nonly we have presumed humbly to represent to you, as they are very\r\nevident, and very great: and as it appears, that the Lord Viscount\r\nTownshend had not any orders, or authority, for concluding several of\r\nthose articles, which are most prejudicial to your Majesty's subjects;\r\nwe have thought we could do no less than declare your said ambassador,\r\nwho negotiated and signed, and all others who advised the ratifying of\r\nthis treaty, enemies to your Majesty and to your kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"Upon these faithful informations, and advices from your Commons, we\r\nassure ourselves your Majesty, in your great goodness to your people,\r\nwill rescue them from those evils, which the private counsels of\r\nill-designing men have exposed them to; and that in your great wisdom\r\nyou will find some means for the explaining, and amending, the several\r\narticles of this treaty, so as that they may consist with the interest\r\nof Great Britain, and with real and lasting friendship between your\r\nMajesty and the States General.\"[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: This Representation was presented to Her Majesty March\r\n4th, 171-1/2 and answered March 5th. [N.]]\r\n\r\nBetween the Representation and the first debates upon the subject of it,\r\nseveral weeks had passed; during which time the Parliament had other\r\nmatters likewise before them, that deserve to be mentioned. For on the\r\nninth of February was repealed the Act for Naturalizing Foreign\r\nProtestants, which had been passed under the last ministry, and, as many\r\npeople thought, to very ill purposes. By this Act any foreigner, who\r\nwould take the oaths to the government, and profess himself a\r\nProtestant, of whatever denomination, was immediately naturalized, and\r\nhad all the privileges of an English born subject, at the expense of a\r\nshilling.[22] Most Protestants abroad differ from us in the points of\r\nchurch government; so that all the acquisitions by this Act would\r\nincrease the number of Dissenters; and therefore the proposal, that such\r\nforeigners should be obliged to conform to the established worship, was\r\nrejected. But because several persons were fond of this project, as a\r\nthing that would be of mighty advantage to the kingdom, I shall say a\r\nfew words upon it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: See \"The Examiner,\" Nos. 26 and 45, in vol. ix. of this\r\nedition. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe maxim, \"That people are the riches of a nation,\" hath been crudely\r\nunderstood by many writers and reasoners upon that subject. There are\r\nseveral ways by which people are brought into a country. Sometimes a\r\nnation is invaded and subdued; and the conquerors seize the lands, and\r\nmake the natives their under-tenants or servants. Colonies have been\r\nalways planted where the natives were driven out or destroyed, or the\r\nland uncultivated and waste. In those countries where the lord of the\r\nsoil is master of the labour and liberty of his tenants, or of slaves\r\nbought by his money, men's riches are reckoned by the number of their\r\nvassals. And sometimes, in governments newly instituted, where there are\r\nnot people to till the ground, many laws have been made to encourage and\r\nallure numbers from the neighbouring countries. And, in all these cases,\r\nthe new comers have either lands allotted them, or are slaves to the\r\nproprietors. But to invite helpless families, by thousands, into a\r\nkingdom inhabited like ours, without lands to give them, and where the\r\nlaws will not allow that they should be part of the property as\r\nservants, is a wrong application of the maxim, and the same thing, in\r\ngreat, as infants dropped at the doors, which are only a burthen and\r\ncharge to the parish. The true way of multiplying mankind to public\r\nadvantage, in such a country as England, is to invite from abroad only\r\nable handicraftsmen and artificers, or such who bring over a sufficient\r\nshare of property to secure them from want; to enact and enforce\r\nsumptuary laws against luxury, and all excesses in clothing, furniture,\r\nand the like; to encourage matrimony, and reward, as the Romans did,\r\nthose who have a certain number of children. Whether bringing over the\r\nPalatines were a mere consequence of this law for a general\r\nnaturalization; or whether, as many surmised, it had some other meaning,\r\nit appeared manifestly, by the issue, that the public was a loser by\r\nevery individual among them; and that a kingdom can no more be the\r\nricher by such an importation, than a man can be fatter by a wen, which\r\nis unsightly and troublesome, at best, and intercepts that nourishment,\r\nwhich would otherwise diffuse itself through the whole body.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after, the Commons sent up a bill for securing the\r\nfreedom of Parliaments, by limiting the number of Members in that House\r\nwho should be allowed to possess employments under the crown.[23] Bills\r\nto the same effect, promoted by both parties, had, after making the like\r\nprogress, been rejected in former Parliaments; the court and ministry,\r\nwho will ever be against such a law, having usually a greater influence\r\nin the House of Lords, and so it happened now. Although that influence\r\nwere less, I am apt to think that such a law would be too thorough a\r\nreformation in one point, while we have so many corruptions in the rest;\r\nand perhaps the regulations, already made on that article, are\r\nsufficient, by which several employments incapacitate a man from being\r\nchosen a Member, and all of them bring it to a new election.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: This self-denying ordinance easily passed through the\r\nHouse of Commons, where probably men were ashamed of opposing it; and in\r\nsuch a temper were the Peers, in whose House the ministry proposed to\r\nmake the stand, that it was very likely to have passed there also. But\r\nan amendment was ingeniously thrown in, to suspend the operation of the\r\nproposed Act until after the Queen's death; so that it was evaded for\r\nthe present, and never again revived. [S.] The Bill was rejected\r\nFebruary 29th, 171-1/2. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: P. Fitzgerald adds, \"Neither do I believe any man who\r\ntruly understands and loves our constitution will imagine that the\r\nprerogative hath not been sufficiently humbled within twenty years\r\npast.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nFor my own part, when I consider the temper of particular persons, and\r\nby what maxims they have acted (almost without exception) in their\r\nprivate capacities, I cannot conceive how such a bill should obtain a\r\nmajority, unless every man expected to be one of the fifty, which, I\r\nthink, was the limitation intended.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, likewise, the House of Commons advanced one\r\nconsiderable step towards securing us against farther impositions from\r\nour allies, resolving that the additional forces should be continued;\r\nbut with a condition, that the Dutch should make good their proportion\r\nof three-fifths to two-fifths, which those confederates had so long, and\r\nin so great degree, neglected. The Duke of Marlborough's deduction of\r\ntwo and a half _per cent._, from the pay of the foreign troops, was also\r\napplied for carrying on the war.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: In the \"Journals of the House of Commons,\" vol. xvii., pp.\r\n15-18, the Report of the Commissioners is printed, in which is included\r\nthe Duke's justification of his conduct. See above, p. 85. [N.]]\r\n\r\nLastly, within this period is to be included the Act passed to prevent\r\nthe disturbing those of the Episcopal Communion in Scotland[26] in the\r\nexercise of their religious worship, and in the use of the liturgy of\r\nthe Church of England.[27] It is known enough, that the most\r\nconsiderable of the nobility and gentry there, as well as great numbers\r\nof the people, dread the tyrannical discipline of those synods and\r\npresbyteries; and at the same time have the utmost contempt for the\r\nabilities and tenets of their teachers. It was besides thought an\r\ninequality, beyond all appearance of reason or justice, that Dissenters\r\nof every denomination here, who are the meanest and most illiterate part\r\namongst us, should possess a toleration by law, under colour of which\r\nthey might, upon occasion, be bold enough to insult the religion\r\nestablished, while those of the Episcopal Church in Scotland[28] groaned\r\nunder a real persecution. The only specious objection against this bill\r\nwas, that it set the religion by law, in both parts of the island, upon\r\na different foot, directly contrary to the Union; because, by an Act\r\npassed this very session against occasional conformity, our Dissenters\r\nwere shut out from all employments. A petition from Carstares, and other\r\nScotch professors, against this bill, was offered to the House, but not\r\naccepted; and a motion made by the other party, to receive a clause that\r\nshould restrain all persons, who have any office in Scotland,[28] from\r\ngoing to episcopal meetings, passed in the negative. It is manifest,\r\nthat the promoters of this clause were not moved by any regard for\r\nScotland,[28] which is by no means their favourite at present; only they\r\nhoped, that, if it were made part of a law, it might occasion such a\r\nchoice of representatives in both Houses, from Scotland,[28] as would be\r\na considerable strength to their faction here. But the proposition was\r\nin itself extremely absurd, that so many lords, and other persons of\r\ndistinction, who have great employments, pensions, posts in the army,\r\nand other places of profit, many of whom are in frequent or constant\r\nattendance at the court, and utterly dislike their national way of\r\nworship, should be deprived of their liberty of conscience at home; not\r\nto mention those who are sent thither from hence to take care of the\r\nrevenue, and other affairs, who would ill digest the changing of their\r\nreligion for that of Scotland.[28]\r\n\r\nWith a farther view of favour towards the episcopal clergy of\r\nScotland,[28] three Members of that country were directed to bring in a\r\nbill for restoring the patrons to their ancient rights of presenting\r\nministers to the vacant churches there, which the kirk, during the\r\nheight of their power, had obtained for themselves[29] And, to conclude\r\nthis subject at once, the Queen, at the close of the session, commanded\r\nMr Secretary St John to acquaint the House, \"That, pursuant to their\r\naddress, the profits arising from the bishops' estates in Scotland,\r\nwhich remained in the crown, should be applied to the support of such of\r\nthe episcopal clergy there, as would take the oaths to Her Majesty.\"[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: P. Fitzgerald says \"North Britain.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The \"Act to prevent,\" etc. (10 Ann. c. 10) was ordered\r\nJanuary 21st, and received the Royal Assent March 3rd, 171-1/2,\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: P. Fitzgerald says \"North Britain.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: The Scotch Patronage Bill was ordered March 13th, [1711],\r\npassed April 7th, and received the Royal Assent May 22nd, 1712 (10 Ann c\r\n21). It did not refer to the Episcopal Church. [W.S.J.]\r\n\r\nThe Church of Scotland viewed the bills for restoring to the gentry the\r\nright of patronage, and for tolerating the exercise of the Episcopal\r\npersuasion, with great jealousy. The Reverend Mr William Carstares, who\r\nhad been secretary to King William, and was Principal of the College of\r\nEdinburgh, was deputed to go to London at the head of a commission of\r\nthe church, to oppose the bills while in dependence. His biographer has\r\njustly remarked, that these enactments considered at the time as fatal\r\nto the interests of Presbytery in Scotland, have, upon experience,\r\nproved her best security.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the one hand, the Act of Toleration, by taking the weapon of\r\noffence out of the hands of the Presbyterians, removed the chief grounds\r\nof those resentments which the friends of prelacy entertained against\r\nthem, and in a few years almost annihilated Episcopacy in Scotland Upon\r\nthe other hand, the Act restoring Patronages, by restoring the nobility\r\nand gentlemen of property to then wonted influence in the settlement of\r\nthe clergy, reconciled numbers of them to the established church, who\r\nhad conceived the most violent prejudices against that mode of election,\r\nand against the Presbyterian clergy, who were settled upon it. It is\r\nlikewise an incontestable fact, that, from the date of these two Acts,\r\nthe Church of Scotland has enjoyed a state of tranquillity to which she\r\nwas an utter stranger before.\" (Life of Carstares, prefixed to\r\nCarstares's \"State Papers,\" 1774, p 85) [S]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: This message was reported to the House of Commons June\r\n19th, 1712. [W.S.J]]\r\n\r\nNothing could more amply justify the proceedings of the Queen and her\r\nministers, for two years past, than that famous Representation above at\r\nlarge recited, the unbiassed wisdom of the nation, after the strictest\r\ninquiry, confirming those facts upon which Her Majesty's counsels were\r\ngrounded and many persons, who were before inclined to believe that the\r\nallies and the late ministry had been too much loaded by the malice,\r\nmisrepresentations, or ignorance of writers, were now fully convinced of\r\ntheir mistake by so great an authority. Upon this occasion I cannot\r\nforbear doing justice to Mr. St. John,[31] who had been secretary of\r\nwar, for several years, under the former administration, where he had\r\nthe advantage of observing how affairs were managed both at home and\r\nabroad. He was one of those who shared in the present treasurer's\r\nfortune, resigning his employment at the same time; and upon that\r\nminister's being again taken into favour, this gentleman was some time\r\nafter made secretary of state. There he began afresh, by the\r\nopportunities of his station, to look into past miscarriages; and, by\r\nthe force of an extraordinary genius, and application to public affairs,\r\njoined with an invincible eloquence, laid open the scene of miscarriages\r\nand corruptions through the whole course of the war, in so evident a\r\nmanner, that the House of Commons seemed principally directed in their\r\nresolutions, upon this inquiry, by his information and advice. In a\r\nshort time after the Representation was published, there appeared a\r\nmemorial in the Dutch \"Gazette,\" as by order of the States, reflecting\r\nvery much upon the said Representation, as well as the resolutions on\r\nwhich it was founded, pretending to deny some of the facts, and to\r\nextenuate others. This memorial, translated into English, a common\r\nwriter of news had the boldness to insert in one of his papers. A\r\ncomplaint being made thereof to the House of Commons, they voted the\r\npretended memorial to be a false, scandalous, malicious libel, and\r\nordered the printer to be taken into custody.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: See his character in Swift's \"Enquiry,\" vol. v., pp.\r\n430-431, of this edition. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: The memorial appeared in the \"Daily Courant\" of 7th and\r\n8th April, for which Samuel Buckley, the writer and printer, was ordered\r\nby the House of Commons to be taken into custody on April 11th.\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of the ministers, that while they were baited by\r\ntheir professed adversaries of the discontented faction, acting in\r\nconfederacy with emissaries of foreign powers, to break the measures Her\r\nMajesty had taken towards a peace, they met at the same time with\r\nfrequent difficulties from those who agreed and engaged with them to\r\npursue the same general end; but sometimes disapproved the methods as\r\ntoo slack and remiss, or, in appearance, now and then perhaps a little\r\ndubious. In the first session of this Parliament, a considerable number\r\nof gentlemen, all members of the House of Commons, began to meet by\r\nthemselves, and consult what course they ought to steer in this new\r\nworld. They intended to revive a new country party in Parliament, which\r\nmight, as in former times, oppose the court in any proceedings they\r\ndisliked. The whole body was of such who profess what is commonly called\r\nhigh-church principles, upon which account they were irreconcilable\r\nenemies to the late ministry and all its adherents. On the other side,\r\nconsidering the temper of the new men in power, that they were persons\r\nwho had formerly moved between the two extremes, those gentlemen, who\r\nwere impatient for an entire change, and to see all their adversaries\r\nlaid at once as low as the dust, began to be apprehensive that the work\r\nwould be done by halves. But the juncture of affairs at that time, both\r\nat home and abroad, would by no means admit of the least precipitation,\r\nalthough the Queen and her first minister had been disposed to it, which\r\ncertainly they were not. Neither did the court seem at all uneasy at\r\nthis league, formed in appearance against it, but composed of honest\r\ngentlemen who wished well to their country, in which both were entirely\r\nagreed, although they might differ about the means; or if such a society\r\nshould begin to grow resty, nothing was easier than to divide them, and\r\nrender all their endeavours ineffectual.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See Swift's \"Advice to Members of the October Club,\" vol.\r\nv., pp. 207-225. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nBut in the course of that first session, many of this society became\r\ngradually reconciled to the new ministry, whom they found to be greater\r\nobjects of the common enemy's hatred than themselves; and the attempt of\r\nGuiscard, as it gained farther time for deferring the disposal of\r\nemployments, so it much endeared that person to the kingdom, who was so\r\nnear falling a sacrifice to the safety of his country. Upon the last\r\nsession of which I am now writing, this October Club (as it was called)\r\nrenewed their usual meetings, but were now very much altered from their\r\noriginal institution, and seemed to have wholly dropped the design, as\r\nof no further use. They saw a point carried in the House of Lords\r\nagainst the court, that would end in the ruin of the kingdom; and they\r\nobserved the enemy's whole artillery directly levelled at the\r\ntreasurer's head. In short, the majority of the club had so good an\r\nunderstanding with the great men at court, that two of the latter,[34]\r\nto shew to the world how fair a correspondence there was between the\r\ncourt and country party, consented to be at one of their dinners; but\r\nthis intercourse had an event very different from what was expected: for\r\nimmediately the more zealous members of that society broke off from the\r\nrest, and composed a new one, made up of gentlemen, who seemed to expect\r\nlittle of the court; and perhaps, with a mixture of others who thought\r\nthemselves disappointed, or too long delayed.[35] Many of these were\r\nobserved to retain an incurable jealousy of the treasurer, and to\r\ninterpret all delays, which they could not comprehend, as a reserve of\r\nfavour in this minister to the persons and principles of the abandoned\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Mr. St. John and Mr. Bromley. [N.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: This was called the March Club, but did not long subsist.\r\nIt seems probable that it included those _Tories_ whose principles went\r\nthe length of Jacobitism. [S.]]\r\n\r\nUpon an occasion offered about this time, some persons, out of distrust\r\nto the treasurer, endeavoured to obtain a point, which could not have\r\nbeen carried without putting all into confusion. A Bill was brought into\r\nthe House of Commons, appointing commissioners to examine into the value\r\nof all lands, and other interests granted by the crown since the\r\nthirteenth day of February, one thousand six hundred and eighty-eight,\r\nand upon what considerations such grants had been made. The united\r\ncountry interest in the House was extremely set upon passing this Bill.\r\nThey had conceived an opinion from former precedents, that the court\r\nwould certainly oppose all steps towards a resumption of grants; and\r\nthose who were apprehensive that the treasurer inclined the same way,\r\nproposed the Bill should be tacked to another, for raising a fund by\r\nduties upon soap and paper, which hath been always imputed, whether\r\njustly or no, as a favourite expedient of those called the Tory party.\r\nAt the same time it was very well known, that the House of Lords had\r\nmade a fixed and unanimous resolution against giving their concurrence\r\nto the passing such united bills: so that the consequences of this\r\nproject must have been to bring the ministry under difficulties, to stop\r\nthe necessary supplies, and endanger the good correspondence between\r\nboth Houses; notwithstanding all which the majority carried it for a\r\ntack; and the committee was instructed accordingly to make the two Bills\r\ninto one, whereby the worst that could happen would have followed, if\r\nthe treasurer had not convinced the warm leaders in this affair, by\r\nundeniable reasons, that the means they were using would certainly\r\ndisappoint the end; that neither himself, nor any other of the Queen's\r\nservants, were at all against this enquiry; and he promised his utmost\r\ncredit to help forward the bill in the House of Lords. He prevailed at\r\nlast to have it sent up single; but their lordships gave it another kind\r\nof reception. Those who were of the side opposite to the court,\r\nwithstood it to a man, as in a party case: among the rest, some very\r\npersonally concerned, and others by friends and relations, which they\r\nsupposed a sufficient excuse to be absent, or dissent. Even those, whose\r\ngrants were antecedent to this intended inspection, began to be alarmed\r\nas men, whose neighbours' houses are on fire. A shew of zeal for the\r\nlate king's honour, occasioned many reflections upon the date of this\r\nenquiry, which was to commence with his reign: and the Earl of\r\nNottingham, who had now flung away the mask which he had lately pulled\r\noff, like one who had no other view but that of vengeance against the\r\nQueen and her friends, acted consistently enough with his design, by\r\nvoting as a lord against the Bill, after he had directed his son in the\r\nHouse of Commons to vote for the tack.\r\n\r\nThus miscarried this popular Bill for appointing commissioners to\r\nexamine into royal grants; but whether those chiefly concerned did\r\nrightly consult their own interest, hath been made a question, which\r\nperhaps time will resolve. It was agreed that the Queen, by her own\r\nauthority, might have issued out a commission for such an enquiry, and\r\nevery body believed, that the intention of the Parliament was only to\r\ntax the grants with about three years' purchase, and at the same time\r\nestablish the proprietors in possession of the remainder for ever; so\r\nthat, upon the whole, the grantees would have been great gainers by such\r\nan Act, since the titles of those lands, as they stood then, were hardly\r\nof half value with others either for sale or settlement. Besides, the\r\nexamples of the Irish forfeitures might have taught these precarious\r\nowners, that when the House of Commons hath once engaged in a pursuit,\r\nwhich they think is right, although it be stopped or suspended for a\r\nwhile, they will be sure to renew it upon every opportunity that offers,\r\nand seldom fail of success: for instance, if the resumption should\r\nhappen to be made part of a supply, which can be easily done without the\r\nobjection of a tack, the grantees might possibly then have much harder\r\nconditions given them; and I do not see how they could prevent it.\r\nWhether the resuming of royal grants be consistent with good policy or\r\njustice, would be too long a disquisition: besides, the profusion of\r\nkings is not like to be a grievance for the future, because there have\r\nbeen laws since made to provide against that evil, or, indeed, rather\r\nbecause the crown has nothing left to give away. But the objection made\r\nagainst the date of the intended enquiry was invidious and trifling; for\r\nKing James II. made very few grants: he was a better manager, and\r\nsquandering was none of his faults; whereas the late king, who came over\r\nhere a perfect stranger to our laws, and to our people, regardless of\r\nposterity, wherein he was not likely to survive, thought he could no way\r\nbetter strengthen a new title, than by purchasing friends at the expense\r\nof every thing which was in his power to part with.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of uniting to a money bill one of a different nature,\r\nwhich is usually called _tacking_ hath been likewise much debated, and\r\nwill admit of argument enough. In ancient times, when a Parliament was\r\nheld, the Commons first proposed their grievances to be redressed, and\r\nthen gave their aids; so that it was a perfect bargain between the king\r\nand the subject. This fully answered the ends of tacking. Aids were then\r\ndemanded upon occasions which would hardly pass at present; such, for\r\ninstance, as those for making the king's son a knight, marrying his\r\neldest daughter, and some others of the like sort. Most of the money\r\nwent into the king's coffers for his private use; neither was he\r\naccountable for any part of it. Hence arose the form of the king's\r\nthanking his subjects for their benevolence, when any subsidies, tenths,\r\nor fifteenths were given him: but the supplies now granted are of\r\nanother nature, and cannot be properly called a particular benefit to\r\nthe crown, because they are all appropriated to their several uses: so\r\nthat when the House of Commons tack to a money bill what is foreign and\r\nhard to be digested, if it be not passed, they put themselves and their\r\ncountry in as great difficulties as the prince. On the other side, there\r\nhave been several regulations made, through the course of time, in\r\nparliamentary proceedings; among which it is grown a rule, that a Bill\r\nonce rejected shall not be brought up again the same session; whereby\r\nthe Commons seem to have lost the advantage of purchasing a redress of\r\ntheir grievances, by granting supplies, which, upon some emergencies,\r\nhath put them upon this expedient of tacking: so that there is more to\r\nbe said on each side of the case, than is convenient for me to trouble\r\nthe reader or myself in deducing.\r\n\r\nAmong the matters of importance during this session, we may justly\r\nnumber the proceedings of the House of Commons with relation to the\r\npress, since Her Majesty's message to the House, of January the\r\nseventeenth, concludes with a paragraph, representing the great licences\r\ntaken in publishing false and scandalous libels, such as are a reproach\r\nto any government; and recommending to them to find a remedy equal to\r\nthe mischief. The meaning of these words in the message, seems to be\r\nconfined to these weekly and daily papers and pamphlets, reflecting upon\r\nthe persons and the management of the ministry. But the House of\r\nCommons, in their address, which answers this message, makes an addition\r\nof the blasphemies against God and religion; and it is certain, that\r\nnothing would be more for the honour of the legislature, than some\r\neffectual law for putting a stop to this universal mischief: but as the\r\nperson,[36] who advised the Queen in that part of her message, had only\r\nthen in his thoughts the redressing of the political and factious\r\nlibels, I think he ought to have taken care, by his great credit in the\r\nHouse, to have proposed some ways by which that evil might be removed;\r\nthe law for taxing single papers having produced a quite contrary\r\neffect, as was then foreseen by many persons, and hath since been found\r\ntrue by experience, For the adverse party, full of rage and leisure\r\nsince their fall, and unanimous in defence of their cause, employ a set\r\nof writers by subscription, who are well versed in all the topics of\r\ndefamation, and have a style and genius levelled to the generality of\r\nreaders; while those who would draw their pens on the side of their\r\nprince and country, are discouraged by this tax, which exceeds the\r\nintrinsic value both of the materials and the work; a thing, if I be not\r\nmistaken, without example.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Mr. Secretary St. John, now Lord Viscount Bolingbroke.\r\n[ORIGINAL NOTE.]]\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged, that the bad practices of printers have been\r\nsuch, as to deserve the severest animadversions of the public; and it is\r\nto be wished, the party quarrels of the pen were always managed with\r\ndecency and truth: but in the mean time, to open the mouths of our\r\nenemies and shut our own, is a turn of politics that wants a little to\r\nbe explained. Perhaps the ministry now in possession, because they are\r\nin possession, may despise such trifles as this; and it is not to be\r\ndenied, that acting as they do upon a national interest, they may seem\r\nto stand in less need of such supports, or may safely fling them down as\r\nno longer necessary. But if the leaders of the other party had proceeded\r\nby this maxim, their power would have been none at all, or of very short\r\nduration: and had not some active pens fallen in to improve the good\r\ndispositions of the people, upon the late change, and continued since to\r\noverthrow the falsehood, plentifully, and sometimes not unplausibly,\r\nscattered by the adversaries, I am very much in doubt, whether those at\r\nthe helm would now have reason to be pleased with their success. A\r\nparticular person may, with more safety, despise the opinion of the\r\nvulgar, because it does a wise man no real harm or good, but the\r\nadministration a great deal; and whatever side has the sole management\r\nof the pen, will soon find hands enough to write down their enemies as\r\nlow as they please. If the people had no other idea of those whom Her\r\nMajesty trusts in her greatest affairs, than what is conveyed by the\r\npassions of such as would compass sea and land for their destruction,\r\nwhat could they expect, but to be torn in pieces by the rage of the\r\nmultitude? How necessary therefore was it, that the world should, from\r\ntime to time, be undeceived by true representations of persons and\r\nfacts, which have kept the kingdom steady to its interest, against all\r\nthe attacks of a cunning and virulent faction.\r\n\r\nHowever, the mischiefs of the press were too exorbitant to be cured, by\r\nsuch a remedy as a tax upon the smaller papers; and a Bill for a much\r\nmore effectual regulation of it was brought into the House of Commons,\r\nbut so late in the session, that there was no time to pass it: for there\r\nhath hitherto always appeared, an unwillingness to cramp overmuch the\r\nliberty of the press, whether from the inconveniencies apprehended from\r\ndoing too much, or too little; or whether the benefit proposed by each\r\nparty to themselves, from the service of their writers, towards\r\nrecovering or preserving of power, be thought to outweigh the\r\ndisadvantages. However it came about, this affair was put off from one\r\nweek to another, and the Bill not brought into the House till the eighth\r\nof June. It was committed three days, and then heard of no more. In this\r\nBill there was a clause inserted, (whether industriously with design to\r\noverthrow it) that the author's name, and place of abode, should be set\r\nto every printed book, pamphlet, or paper; which I believe no man, who\r\nhath the least regard to learning, would give his consent to: for,\r\nbesides the objection to this clause from the practice of pious men,\r\nwho, in publishing excellent writings for the service of religion, have\r\nchosen, out of an humble Christian spirit, to conceal their names; it is\r\ncertain, that all persons of true genius or knowledge have an invincible\r\nmodesty and suspicion of themselves, upon their first sending their\r\nthoughts into the world; and that those who are dull or superficial,\r\nvoid of all-taste and judgment, have dispositions directly contrary: so\r\nthat if this clause had made part of a law, there would have been an\r\nend, in all likelihood, of any valuable production for the future,\r\neither in wit or learning: and that insufferable race of stupid people,\r\nwho are now every day loading the press, would then reign alone, in time\r\ndestroy our very first principles of reason, and introduce barbarity\r\namongst us, which is already kept out with so much difficulty by so few\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nHaving given an account of the several steps made towards a peace, from\r\nthe first overtures begun by France, to the commencement of the second\r\nsession, I shall in the Fourth Book relate the particulars of this great\r\nnegotiation, from the period last mentioned to the present time; and\r\nbecause there happened some passages in both Houses, occasioned by the\r\ntreaty, I shall take notice of them under that head. There only remains\r\nto be mentioned one affair of another nature, which the Lords and\r\nCommons took into their cognizance, after a very different manner,\r\nwherewith I shall close this part of my subject.\r\n\r\nThe sect of Quakers amongst us, whose system of religion, first founded\r\nupon enthusiasm, hath been many years growing into a craft, held it an\r\nunlawful action to take an oath to a magistrate. This doctrine was\r\ntaught them by the author of their sect, from a literal application of\r\nthe text, \"Swear not at all;\" but being a body of people, wholly turned\r\nto trade and commerce of all kinds, they found themselves on many\r\noccasions deprived of the benefit of the law, as well as of voting at\r\nelections, by a foolish scruple, which their obstinacy would not suffer\r\nthem to get over. To prevent this inconvenience, these people had credit\r\nenough in the late reign to have an Act passed, that their solemn\r\naffirmation and declaration should be accepted, instead of an oath in\r\nthe usual form. The great concern in those times, was to lay all\r\nreligion upon a level; in order to which, this maxim was advanced, \"That\r\nno man ought to be denied the liberty of serving his country upon\r\naccount of a different belief in speculative opinions,\" under which term\r\nsome people were apt to include every doctrine of Christianity: however,\r\nthis Act, in favour of the Quakers, was only temporary, in order to keep\r\nthem in constant dependence, and expired of course after a certain term,\r\nif it were not continued. Those people had, therefore, very early in the\r\nsession, offered a petition to the House of Commons for a continuance of\r\nthe Act, which was not suffered to be brought up; upon this they applied\r\nthemselves to the Lords, who passed a Bill accordingly, and sent it down\r\nto the Commons, where it was not so much as allowed a first reading.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it is not easy to conceive upon what motives the legislature\r\nof so great a kingdom could descend so low, as to be ministerial and\r\nsubservient to the caprices of the most absurd heresy that ever appeared\r\nin the world; and this in a point, where those deluding or deluded\r\npeople stand singular from all the rest of mankind who live under civil\r\ngovernment: but the designs of an aspiring party, at that time were not\r\notherwise to be compassed, than by undertaking any thing that would\r\nhumble and mortify the Church; and I am fully convinced, that if a sect\r\nof sceptic philosophers (who profess to doubt of every thing) had been\r\nthen among us, and mingled their tenets with some corruptions of\r\nChristianity, they might have obtained the same privilege; and that a\r\nlaw would have been enacted, whereby the solemn doubt of the people\r\ncalled sceptics, should have been accepted instead of an oath in the\r\nusual form; so absurd are all maxims formed upon the inconsistent\r\nprinciples of faction, when once they are brought to be examined by the\r\nstandard of truth and reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****       *****       *****       *****       *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE FOUR LAST\r\n\r\nYEARS OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left the plenipotentiaries of the allies, and those of the enemy,\r\npreparing to assemble at Utrecht on the first of January, N.S., in order\r\nto form a congress for negotiating a general peace; wherein although the\r\nDutch had made a mighty merit of their compliance with the Queen, yet\r\nthey set all their instruments at work to inflame both Houses against\r\nHer Majesty's measures. Mons. Bothmar, the Hanover envoy, took care to\r\nprint and disperse his Memorial, of which I have formerly spoken:\r\nHoffman, the Emperor's resident, was soliciting for a yacht and convoys\r\nto bring over Prince Eugene at this juncture, fortified, as it was given\r\nout, with great proposals from the Imperial court: the Earl of\r\nNottingham became a convert, for reasons already mentioned: money was\r\ndistributed where occasion required; and the Dukes of Somerset and\r\nMarlborough, together with the Earl of Godolphin, had put themselves at\r\nthe head of the junto, and their adherents, in order to attack the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nSome days after the vote passed the House of Lords for admitting into\r\nthe address the Earl of Nottingham's clause, against any peace without\r\nSpain; Mons. Buys, the Dutch envoy, who had been deep in all the\r\nconsultations with the discontented party for carrying that point, was\r\ndesired to meet with the lord privy seal, the Earl of Dartmouth, and Mr.\r\nSecretary St. John, in order to sign a treaty between the Queen and the\r\nStates, to subsist after a peace. There the envoy took occasion to\r\nexpostulate upon the advantages stipulated for Britain with France; said\r\n\"It was his opinion, that those ministers ought, in respect of the\r\nfriendship between both nations, to acquaint him what these advantages\r\nwere; and that he looked upon his country to be entitled, by treaty, to\r\nshare them equally with us: That there was now another reason why we\r\nshould be more disposed to comply with him upon this head; for since the\r\nlate resolution of the House of Lords, he took it for granted, it would\r\nbe a dangerous step in us to give Spain to a prince of the house of\r\nBourbon; and therefore, that we should do well to induce the States, by\r\nsuch a concession, to help us out of this difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. St. John made answer, \"That there was not a man in the Queen's\r\ncouncil capable of so base a thought: That if Buys had any thing to\r\ncomplain of, which was injurious to Holland, or justly tending to hurt\r\nthe good correspondence between us and the States, he was confident Her\r\nMajesty would at all times be ready to give it up; but that the\r\nministers scorned to screen themselves at the expense of their country:\r\nThat the resolution Buys mentioned, was chiefly owing to foreign\r\nministers intermeddling in our affairs, and would perhaps have an effect\r\nthe projectors did not foresee: That, if the peace became impracticable,\r\nthe House of Commons would certainly put the war upon another foot, and\r\nreduce the public expense within such a compass as our treaties required\r\nin the strictest sense, and as our present condition would admit,\r\nleaving the partisans for war to supply the rest.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the secretary believed this answer would put an end to such\r\ninfamous proposals, it fell out otherwise; for shortly after, Mons. Buys\r\napplied himself to the treasurer, promising to undertake, \"That his\r\nmasters should give up the article of Spain, provided they might share\r\nwith us in the Assiento for negroes.\" To which the treasurer's answer\r\nwas short, \"That he would rather lose his head than consent to such an\r\noffer.\"\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, by this proceeding, that whatever schemes were forming\r\nhere at home, in this juncture, by the enemies to the peace, the Dutch\r\nonly designed to fall in with it as far as it would answer their own\r\naccount; and, by a strain of the lower politics, wherein they must be\r\nallowed to excel every country in Christendom, lay upon the watch for a\r\ngood bargain, by taking advantage of the distress they themselves had\r\nbrought upon their nearest neighbour and ally.\r\n\r\nBut the Queen highly resented this indignity from a republic, upon whom\r\nshe had conferred so many obligations. She could not endure that the\r\nDutch should employ their instruments to act in confederacy with a cabal\r\nof factious people, who were prepared to sacrifice the safety of their\r\nprince and country to the recovery of that power they had so long\r\npossessed and abused. Her Majesty knew very well, that whatever were the\r\nmistaken or affected opinion of some people at home, upon the article of\r\nSpain, it was a point the States had long given up, who had very openly\r\ntold our ministry, \"That the war in that country was only our concern,\r\nand what their republic had nothing to do with.\" It is true, the\r\nparty-leaders were equally convinced, that the recovery of Spain was\r\nimpracticable; but many things may be excused in a professed adversary,\r\nfallen under disgrace, which are highly criminal in an ally, upon whom\r\nwe are that very instant conferring new favours. Her Majesty therefore\r\nthought it high time to exert herself, and at length put a stop to\r\nforeign influence upon British counsels; so that, after the Earl of\r\nNottingham's clause against any peace, without Spain, was carried in the\r\nHouse of Lords, directions were immediately sent to the Earl of\r\nStrafford at The Hague, to inform the Dutch, \"That it was obtained by a\r\ntrick, and would consequently turn to the disappointment and confusion\r\nof the contrivers and the actors.\" He was likewise instructed to be very\r\ndry and reserved to the pensionary and Dutch ministers; to let them\r\nknow, \"The Queen thought herself ill treated; and that they would soon\r\nhear what effects those measures would have upon a mild and good temper,\r\nwrought up to resentment by repeated provocations: That the States might\r\nhave the war continued, if they pleased; but that the Queen would not be\r\nforced to carry it on after their manner, nor would suffer them to make\r\nher peace, or to settle the interests of her kingdoms.\"\r\n\r\nTo others in Holland, who appeared to be more moderate, the Earl was\r\ndirected to say, \"That the States were upon a wrong scent: That their\r\nminister here mistook every thing that we had promised: That we would\r\nperform all they could reasonably ask from us, in relation to their\r\nbarrier and their trade; and that Mons. Buys dealt very unfairly, if he\r\nhad not told them as much. But that Britain proceeded, in some respects,\r\nupon a new scheme of politics; would no longer struggle for\r\nimpossibilities, nor be amused by words: That our people came more and\r\nmore to their senses; and that the single dispute now was, whether the\r\nDutch would join with a faction, against the Queen, or with the nation,\r\nfor her?\"\r\n\r\nThe court likewise resolved to discourage Prince Eugene from his journey\r\nto England, which he was about this time undertaking, and of which I\r\nhave spoken before. He was told, \"That the Queen wanted no exhortations\r\nto carry on the war; but the project of it should be agreed abroad, upon\r\nwhich Her Majesty's resolutions might soon be signified: but until she\r\nsaw what the Emperor and allies were ready to do, she would neither\r\npromise nor engage for any thing.\" At the same time Mr. St. John told\r\nHoffman, the Emperor's resident here, \"That if the Prince had a mind to\r\ndivert himself in London, the ministers would do their part to entertain\r\nhim, and be sure to trouble him with no manner of business.\"\r\n\r\nThis coldness retarded the Prince's journey for some days; but did not\r\nprevent it, although he had a second message by the Queen's order, with\r\nthis farther addition, \"That his name had lately been made use of, on\r\nmany occasions, to create a ferment, and stir up sedition; and that Her\r\nMajesty judged it would be neither safe for him, nor convenient for her,\r\nthat he should come over at this time.\" But all would not do: it was\r\nenough that the Queen did not absolutely forbid him, and the\r\nparty-confederates, both foreign and domestic, thought his presence\r\nwould be highly necessary for their service.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of December, the lord privy seal[1] set out for Holland.\r\nHe was ordered to stop at The Hague, and, in conjunction with the Earl\r\nof Stafford, to declare to the States, in Her Majesty's name, \"Her\r\nresolutions to conclude no peace, wherein the allies in general, and\r\neach confederate in particular, might not find their ample security, and\r\ntheir reasonable satisfaction: That she was ready to insist upon their\r\nbarrier, and advantages in their trade, in the manner the States\r\nthemselves should desire; and to concert with them such a plan of\r\ntreaty, as both powers might be under mutual engagements never to recede\r\nfrom: That nothing could be of greater importance, than for the\r\nministers of Great Britain and Holland to enter the congress under the\r\nstrictest ties of confidence, and entirely to concur throughout the\r\ncourse of these negotiations: To which purpose, it was Her Majesty's\r\npleasure, that their lordships should adjust with the Dutch ministers,\r\nthe best manner and method for opening and carrying on the conferences,\r\nand declare themselves instructed to communicate freely their thoughts\r\nand measures to the plenipotentiaries of the States, who, they hoped,\r\nhad received the same instructions.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Robinson had already had diplomatic experience as\r\npolitical agent at the Court of Stockholm, when Marlborough had found\r\nhim of great service. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nLastly, the two lords were to signify to the pensionary, and the other\r\nministers, \"That Her Majesty's preparations for the next campaign were\r\ncarried on with all the dispatch and vigour, which the present\r\ncircumstances would allow; and to insist, that the same might be done by\r\nthe States; and that both powers should join in pressing the Emperor,\r\nand other allies, to make greater efforts than they had hitherto done;\r\nwithout which the war must languish, and the terms of peace become every\r\nday more disadvantageous.\"\r\n\r\nThe two British plenipotentiaries went to Utrecht with very large\r\ninstructions, and, after the usual manner, were to make much higher\r\ndemands from France (at least in behalf of the allies) than they could\r\nhave any hope to obtain. The sum of what they had in charge, besides\r\nmatter of form, was, to concert with the ministers of the several powers\r\nengaged against France, \"That all differences arising among them should\r\nbe accommodated between themselves, without suffering the French to\r\ninterfere: That whatever were proposed to France by a minister of the\r\nalliance, should be backed by the whole confederacy: That a time might\r\nbe fixed for the conclusion, as there had been for the commencement, of\r\nthe treaty.\" Spain was to be demanded out of the hands of the Bourbon\r\nfamily, as the most effectual means for preventing the union of that\r\nkingdom with France; and whatever conditions the allies could agree upon\r\nfor hindering that union, their lordships were peremptorily to insist\r\non.\r\n\r\nAs to the interests of each ally in particular, the plenipotentiaries of\r\nBritain were to demand \"Strasbourg, the fort of Kehl, with its\r\ndependencies, and the town of Brisach, with its territory, for the\r\nEmperor: That France should possess Alsatia, according to the Treaty of\r\nWestphalia, with the right of the prefecture only over the ten imperial\r\ncities in that country: That the fortifications of the said ten cities\r\nbe put into the condition they were in at the time of the said treaty,\r\nexcept Landau, which was to be demanded for the Emperor and empire, with\r\nliberty of demolishing the fortifications: That the French King should\r\nat a certain time, and at his own expense, demolish the fortresses of\r\nHuningen, New Brisach, and Fort Lewis, never to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\n\"That the town and fortress of Rhinfels should be demanded for the\r\nlandgrave of Hesse-Cassel, until that matter be otherwise settled.\r\n\r\n\"That the clause relating to religion, in the fourth article of the\r\nTreaty of Ryswyck, and contrary to that of Westphalia, should be\r\nannulled, and the state of religion in Germany restored to the tenor of\r\nthe Treaty of Westphalia.\r\n\r\n\"That France should acknowledge the King of Prussia, and give him no\r\ndisturbance in Neufchatel and Vallengin.\r\n\r\n\"That the principality of Orange, and other estates belonging to the\r\nlate King William, should be restored, as law should direct.\r\n\r\n\"That the Duke of Hanover should be acknowledged elector.\r\n\r\n\"That the King of Portugal should enjoy all the advantages stipulated\r\nbetween him and the allies.\r\n\r\n\"That the States should have for their barrier Furnes, Fort Knokke,\r\nMenin, Ypres, Lille, Tournay, Condé, Valenciennes, Maubeuge, Douay,\r\nBethune, Aire,[2] St. Venant, and Bouchain, with their cannon, &c. That\r\nthe French King should restore all the places belonging to Spain, now or\r\nduring this war in his possession, in the Netherlands: That such part of\r\nthem as should be thought fit, might be allowed likewise for a barrier\r\nto the States: That France should grant the tariff of one thousand six\r\nhundred and sixty-four to the States, and exemption of fifty pence _per_\r\ntun upon Dutch goods trading to that kingdom. But that these articles in\r\nfavour of the States should not be concluded, till the Barrier Treaty\r\nwere explained to the Queen's satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 2 \"Bethune Avie\" in original: a manifest misprint. \"Aire\" is\r\nthe name of a place near Bethune, which has since been connected with it\r\nby a canal. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\"That the Duke of Savoy should be put in possession of all taken from\r\nhim in this war, and enjoy the places yielded to him by the Emperor, and\r\nother allies: That France should likewise yield to him Exilles,\r\nFenestrelle, Chaumont, the valley of Pragelas, and the land lying\r\nbetween Piedmont and Mount Genu.\r\n\r\n\"That the article about demolishing of Dunkirk should be explained.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Britain, the plenipotentiaries were to insist, \"That Nieuport,\r\nDendermonde, Ghent, and all places which appear to be a barrier rather\r\nagainst England than France, should either not be given to the Dutch, or\r\nat least in such a manner, as not to hinder the Queen's subjects free\r\npassage to and from the Low Countries.\r\n\r\n\"That the seventh article of the Barrier Treaty, which empowers the\r\nStates, in case of an attack, to put troops at discretion in all the\r\nplaces of the Low Countries, should be so explained as to be understood\r\nonly of an attack from France.\r\n\r\n\"That Britain should trade to the Low Countries with the same privileges\r\nas the States themselves.\r\n\r\n\"That the Most Christian King should acknowledge the succession of\r\nHanover, and immediately oblige the Pretender to leave France; and that\r\nthe said King should promise, for himself and his heirs, never to\r\nacknowledge any person for King or Queen of England, otherwise than\r\naccording to the settlements now in force.\r\n\r\n\"That a treaty of commerce should be commenced, as soon as possible,\r\nbetween France and Britain; and in the mean time, the necessary points\r\nrelating to it be settled.\r\n\r\n\"That the Isle of St. Christopher's should be surrendered to the Queen,\r\nHudson's Bay restored, Placentia and the whole island of Newfoundland\r\nyielded to Britain by the Most Christian King; who was likewise to quit\r\nall claim to Nova Scotia and Annapolis Royal.\r\n\r\n\"That Gibraltar and Minorca should be annexed to the British crown.\r\n\r\n\"That the Assiento should be granted to Britain for thirty years, with\r\nthe same advantage as to France; with an extent of ground on the river\r\nof Plata, for keeping and refreshing the negroes.\r\n\r\n\"That Spain should grant to the subjects of Britain as large privileges\r\nas to any other nation whatsoever; as likewise an exemption of duties,\r\namounting to an advantage of at least fifteen _per cent_.\r\n\r\n\"That satisfaction should be demanded for what should appear to be\r\njustly due to Her Majesty, from the Emperor and the States.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, That the plenipotentiaries should consult with those of the\r\nProtestant allies, the most effectual methods for restoring the\r\nProtestants of France to their religious and civil liberties, and for\r\nthe immediate release of those who are now in the galleys.\"\r\n\r\nWhat part of these demands were to be insisted on, and what were to be\r\ngiven up, will appear by the sequel of this negotiation. But there was\r\nno difficulty of moment enough to retard the peace, except a method for\r\npreventing the union of France and Spain under one prince, and the\r\nsettling the barrier for Holland; which last, as claimed by the States,\r\ncould, in prudence and safety, be no more allowed by us than by France.\r\n\r\nThe States General having appointed Mons. Buys to be one of their\r\nplenipotentiaries at Utrecht, that minister left England a few days\r\nafter the lord privy seal. In his last conference with the lords of the\r\ncouncil, he absolutely declared, \"That his masters had done their\r\nutmost, both by sea and land: That it was unreasonable to expect more:\r\nThat they had exceeded their proportion, even beyond Britain; and that\r\nas to the Emperor, and other allies, he knew no expedient left for\r\nmaking them act with more vigour, than to pursue them with pathetical\r\nexhortations.\"\r\n\r\nThis minister was sent over hither, instructed and empowered by halves.\r\nThe ferment raised by the united endeavours of our party leaders, among\r\nwhom he was a constant fellow-labourer to the utmost of his skill, had\r\nwholly confounded him; and thinking to take the advantage of negotiating\r\nwell for Holland at the expense of Britain, he acted but ill for his own\r\ncountry, and worse for the common cause. However, the Queen's ministers\r\nand he parted with the greatest civility; and Her Majesty's present was\r\ndouble the value of what is usual to the character he bore.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Compare this passage with one in Bolingbroke's\r\n\"Correspondence\" (vol. ii., pp. 108-109): \"He [Buys] came over\r\ninstructed and empowered by halves. The ferment which had been created\r\nby the joint efforts of the faction here, and of that in Holland,\r\nconfounded him; and thinking to take this advantage of negotiating well\r\nfor Holland at the expense of Britain, he has negotiated ill for both\r\nand ill for the common cause. We parted in terms of the greatest\r\ncivility, and Her Majesty's present to him was a thousand pounds,\r\nwhich is double the value of what is ever given here to an\r\nenvoy-extraordinary.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAs the Queen was determined to alter her measures in making war, so she\r\nthought nothing would so much convince the States of the necessity of a\r\npeace, as to have them frequently put in mind of this resolution, which\r\nher ambassador Strafford, then at The Hague, was accordingly directed to\r\ndo: and if they should object, of what ill consequence it would be for\r\nthe enemy to know Her Majesty designed to lessen her expenses, he might\r\nanswer, \"That the ministers here were sorry for it; but the Dutch could\r\nonly blame themselves, for forcing into such a necessity a princess, to\r\nwhose friendship they owed the preservation and grandeur of their\r\nrepublic, and choosing to lean on a broken faction, rather than place\r\ntheir confidence in the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Her Majesty's earnest desire, that there should be a perfect\r\nagreement at this treaty between the ministers of all the allies, than\r\nwhich nothing could be more effectual to make France comply with their\r\njust demands: above all, she directed her plenipotentiaries to enter\r\ninto the strictest confidence with those of Holland; and that, after the\r\nStates had consented to explain the Barrier Treaty to her reasonable\r\nsatisfaction, both powers should form between them a plan of general\r\npeace, from which they would not recede, and such as might secure the\r\nquiet of Europe, as well as the particular interests of each\r\nconfederate.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch were accordingly pressed, before the congress opened, to come\r\nto some temperament upon that famous treaty; because the ministers here\r\nexpected it would be soon laid before the House of Commons, by which the\r\nresentment of the nation would probably appear against those who had\r\nbeen actors and advisers in it: but Mons. Buys, who usually spoke for\r\nhis colleagues, was full of opposition, began to expostulate upon the\r\nadvantages Britain had stipulated with France; and to insist, that his\r\nmasters ought to share equally in them all, but especially the Assiento\r\ncontract: so that no progress was made in fixing a previous good\r\ncorrespondence between Britain and the States, which Her Majesty had so\r\nearnestly recommended.\r\n\r\nCertain regulations having been agreed upon, for avoiding of ceremony\r\nand other inconveniencies, the conferences began at Utrecht, upon the\r\ntwenty-ninth of January, N.S. one thousand seven hundred and\r\neleven-twelve, at ten in the morning. The ministers of the allies going\r\ninto the town-house at one door, and those of France, at the same\r\ninstant, at another, they all took their seats without distinction; and\r\nthe Bishop of Bristol, lord privy seal, first plenipotentiary of\r\nBritain, opened the assembly with a short speech, directed to the\r\nministers of France, in words to the following effect:\r\n\r\n\"MESSIEURS,\r\n\r\n\"We are here to meet to-day, in the name of God, to enter upon a treaty\r\nof general peace, between the high allies and the King your master. We\r\nbring sincere intentions, and express orders from our superiors, to\r\nconcur, on their part, with whatever may advance and perfect so salutary\r\nand Christian a work. On the other side, we hope you have the same\r\ndisposition; and that your orders will be so full, as to be able,\r\nwithout loss of time, to answer the expectation of the high allies, by\r\nexplaining yourselves clearly and roundly upon the points we shall have\r\nto settle in these conferences; and that you will perform this in so\r\nplain and specific a manner, as every prince and state in the\r\nconfederacy may find a just and reasonable satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nThe French began, by promising to explain the overtures which Mons.\r\nMesnager had delivered to the Queen some months before, and to give in a\r\nspecific project of what their master would yield, provided the allies\r\nwould each give a specific answer, by making their several demands;\r\nwhich method, after many difficulties, and affected delays in the Dutch,\r\nwas at length agreed to.\r\n\r\nBut the States, who had, with the utmost discontent, seen Her Majesty at\r\nthe head of this negotiation, where they intended to have placed\r\nthemselves, began to discover their ill-humour upon every occasion; they\r\nraised endless difficulties about settling the Barrier Treaty, as the\r\nQueen desired; and in one of the first general conferences, they would\r\nnot suffer the British secretary to take the minutes, but nominated some\r\nDutch professor for that office, which the Queen refused, and resented\r\ntheir behaviour as an useless cavil, intended only to shew their want of\r\nrespect. The British plenipotentiaries had great reason to suspect, that\r\nthe Dutch were, at this time, privately endeavouring to engage in some\r\nseparate measures with France, by the intervention of one Molo, a busy\r\nfactious agent at Amsterdam, who had been often employed in such\r\nintrigues: that this was the cause which made them so litigious and slow\r\nin all their steps, in hopes to break the congress, and find better\r\nterms for their trade and barrier, from the French, than we ever could\r\nthink fit to allow them. The Dutch ministers did also apply themselves\r\nwith industry, to cultivate the imperial plenipotentiary's favour, in\r\norder to secure all advantages of commerce with Spain and the West\r\nIndies, in case those dominions could be procured for the Emperor: for\r\nthis reason they avoided settling any general plan of peace, in concert\r\nwith the plenipotentiaries of Britain, which Her Majesty desired; and\r\nMons. Buys plainly told their lordships, that it was a point, which\r\nneither he nor his colleagues could consent to, before the States were\r\nadmitted equal sharers with Britain in the trade of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe court having notice of this untractable temper in the Dutch, gave\r\ndirect orders to the plenipotentiaries of Britain, for pressing those of\r\nthe States to adjust the gross in equalities of the Barrier Treaty,\r\nsince nothing was more usual or agreeable to reason than for princes,\r\nwho find themselves aggrieved by prejudicial contracts, to expect they\r\nshould be modified and explained. And since it now appeared by votes in\r\nthe House of Commons, that the sense of the nation agreed with what Her\r\nMajesty desired, if the Dutch ministers would not be brought to any\r\nmoderate terms upon this demand, their lordships were directed to\r\nimprove and amend the particular concessions made to Britain by France,\r\nand form them into a treaty, for the Queen was determined never to allow\r\nthe States any share in the Assiento, Gibraltar, and Port Mahon, nor\r\ncould think it reasonable, that they should be upon an equal foot with\r\nher in the trade of Spain, to the conquest whereof they had contributed\r\nso little.\r\n\r\nNor was the conduct of the imperial minister at this time less\r\nperplexing than that of the States, both those powers appearing fully\r\nbent, either upon breaking off the negotiation, or, upon forcing from\r\nthe Queen those advantages she expected by it for her own kingdoms. Her\r\nMajesty therefore thought fit, about the beginning of March, to send Mr.\r\nThomas Harley, a near relation of the treasurer's, to Utrecht, fully\r\ninformed of her mind, which he was directed to communicate to the\r\nplenipotentiaries of Britain.\r\n\r\nMr. Harley stopped in his way to Utrecht at The Hague, and there told\r\nthe pensionary, \"That nothing had happened lately in England but what\r\nwas long ago foretold him, as well as the other ministers of the allies.\r\nThat the proceedings of the House of Commons, particularly about the\r\nBarrier Treaty, must chiefly be ascribed to the manner in which the\r\nQueen and the nation had been treated by Mons. Bothmar, Count Gallas,\r\nBuys, and other foreign ministers. That if the States would yet enter\r\ninto a strict union with the Queen, give her satisfaction in the said\r\ntreaty, and join in concert with her plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, a\r\nsafe and advantageous peace might be obtained for the whole alliance;\r\notherwise Her Majesty must save her own country, and join with such of\r\nher allies as would join with her.\r\n\r\n\"As to the war, that the conduct of the allies, and their opposition to\r\nthe Queen, by private intrigues carried on among her own subjects, as\r\nwell as by open remonstrances, had made the House of Commons take that\r\nmatter out of the hands of the ministers.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, that in case the present treaty were broken off by the Dutch\r\nrefusing to comply, Her Majesty thought it reasonable to insist, that\r\nsome cautionary places be put into her hands as pledges, that no other\r\nnegotiation should be entered into by the States General, without her\r\nparticipation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harley's instructions to the Queen's plenipotentiaries were, \"That\r\nthey should press those of France, to open themselves as far as\r\npossible, in concerting such a plan of a general peace, as might give\r\nreasonable satisfaction to all the confederates, and such as her\r\nParliament would approve: That the people of England believed France\r\nwould consent to such a plan; wherein if they found themselves deceived,\r\nthey would be as eager for prosecuting the war as ever.\"\r\n\r\nTheir lordships were to declare openly to the Dutch, \"That no extremity\r\nshould make Her Majesty depart from insisting to have the Assiento for\r\nher own subjects, and to keep Gibraltar and Port Mahon; but if the\r\nStates would agree with her upon these three heads, she would be content\r\nto reduce the trade of Spain and the West Indies, to the condition it\r\nwas in under the late Catholic King Charles II.\"\r\n\r\nThe French were farther to be pressed, \"That the Pretender should be\r\nimmediately sent out of that kingdom; and that the most effectual method\r\nshould be taken, for preventing the union of France and Spain under one\r\nprince.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time Her Majesty's ministers, and those of the allies at\r\nUtrecht, delivered in the several _postulata_ or demands of their\r\nmasters to the French plenipotentiaries, which having been since made\r\npublic, and all of them, except those of Britain, very much varying in\r\nthe course of the negotiation, the reader would be but ill entertained\r\nwith a transcript of them here.\r\n\r\nUpon intelligence of the last dauphin's death, the father, son, and\r\ngrandson, all of that title,[4] dying within the compass of a year,\r\nMons. Gaultier went to France with letters to the Marquis de Torcy, to\r\npropose Her Majesty's expedient for preventing the union of that kingdom\r\nwith Spain; which, as it was the most important article to be settled,\r\nin order to secure peace for Europe, so it was a point that required to\r\nbe speedily adjusted under the present circumstances and situation of\r\nthe Bourbon family, there being only left a child of two years old to\r\nstand between the Duke of Anjou and his succeeding to the crown of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: These princes were the grandfather, the father, and the\r\nbrother, of Louis XV., who was then Duke of Anjou, and supposed to be at\r\nthe point of death. [N.]]\r\n\r\nHer Majesty likewise pressed France by the same dispatches, to send full\r\ninstructions to their plenipotentiaries, empowering them to offer to the\r\nallies such a plan of peace, as might give reasonable satisfaction to\r\nall her allies.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's proposal for preventing an union between France and Spain\r\nwas, \"that Philip should formally renounce the kingdom of France for\r\nhimself and his posterity; and that this renunciation should be\r\nconfirmed by the Cortes or states of Spain, who, without question, would\r\nheartily concur against such an union, by which their country must\r\nbecome a province to France.\" In like manner, the French princes of the\r\nblood were severally to renounce all title to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe French raised many difficulties upon several particulars of this\r\nexpedient; but the Queen persisted to refuse any plan of peace before\r\nthis weighty point were settled in the manner she proposed, which was\r\nafterwards submitted to, as in proper place we shall observe. In the\r\nmean time, the negotiation at Utrecht proceeded with a very slow pace;\r\nthe Dutch interposing all obstructions they could contrive, refusing to\r\ncome to any reasonable temper upon the Barrier Treaty, or to offer a\r\nplan, in concert with the Queen, for a general peace. Nothing less would\r\nsatisfy them, than the partaking in those advantages we had stipulated\r\nfor ourselves, and which did no ways interfere with their trade or\r\nsecurity. They still expected some turn in England; their friends on\r\nthis side had ventured to assure them, that the Queen could not live\r\nmany months, which, indeed, from the bad state of Her Majesty's health,\r\nwas reasonable to expect. The British plenipotentiaries daily discovered\r\nnew endeavours of Holland to treat privately with France; and, lastly,\r\nthose among the States, who desired the war should continue, strove to\r\ngain time, until the campaign should open; and by resolving to enter\r\ninto action with the first opportunity, render all things desperate, and\r\nbreak up the congress.\r\n\r\nThis scheme did exactly fall in with Prince Eugene's dispositions, whom\r\nthe States had chosen for their general, and of whose conduct, in this\r\nconjuncture, the Queen had too much reason to be jealous; but Her\r\nMajesty, who was resolved to do her utmost towards putting a good and\r\nspeedy end to this war, having placed the Duke of Ormonde at the head of\r\nher forces in Flanders, whither he was now arrived, directed him to keep\r\nall the troops in British pay, whether subjects or foreigners,\r\nimmediately under his own command; and to be cautious, for a while, in\r\nengaging in any action of importance, unless upon a very apparent\r\nadvantage. At the same time the Queen determined to make one thorough\r\ntrial of the disposition of the States, by allowing them the utmost\r\nconcessions that could any way suit either with her safety or honour.\r\nShe therefore directed her ministers at Utrecht, to tell the Dutch,\r\n\"That, in order to shew how desirous she was to live in perfect amity\r\nwith that republic, she would resign up the fifteen _per cent._,\r\nadvantage upon English goods sent to the Spanish dominions, which the\r\nFrench King had offered her by a power from his grandson,[5] and be\r\ncontent to reduce that trade to the state in which it was under the late\r\nKing of Spain. She would accept of any tolerable softening of these\r\nwords in the seventh article of the Barrier Treaty, where it is said,\r\n'The States shall have power, in case of an apparent attack, to put as\r\nmany troops as they please into all the places of the Netherlands,'\r\nwithout specifying an attack from the side of France, as ought to have\r\nbeen done; otherwise, the Queen might justly think they were preparing\r\nthemselves for a rupture with Britain. Her Majesty likewise consented,\r\nthat the States should keep Nieuport, Dendermonde, and the Castle of\r\nGhent, as an addition to their barrier, although she were sensible how\r\ninjurious those concessions would be to the trade of her subjects; and\r\nwould waive the demand of Ostend being delivered into her hands, which\r\nshe might with justice insist on. In return for all this, that the Queen\r\nonly desired the ministers of the States would enter into a close\r\ncorrespondence with hers, and settle between them some plan of a general\r\npeace, which might give reasonable content to all her allies, and which\r\nHer Majesty would endeavour to bring France to consent to. She desired\r\nthe trade of her kingdoms to the Netherlands, and to the towns of their\r\nbarrier, might be upon as good a foot as it was before the war began:\r\nThat the Dutch would not insist to have share in the Assiento, to which\r\nthey had not the least pretensions, and that they would no longer\r\nencourage the intrigues of a faction against her government. Her Majesty\r\nassured them in plain terms, that her own future measures, and the\r\nconduct of her plenipotentiaries, should be wholly governed by their\r\nbehaviour in these points; and that her offers were only conditional, in\r\ncase of their compliance with what she desired.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Philip V., King of Spain. [W. S, J.]]\r\n\r\nBut all these proofs of the Queen's kindness and sincerity could not\r\navail. The Dutch ministers pleaded, they had no power to concert the\r\nplan of general peace with those of Britain: however, they assured the\r\nlatter, that the Assiento was the only difficulty which stuck with their\r\nmasters. Whereupon, at their desire, a contract for that traffic was\r\ntwice read to them; after which they appeared very well satisfied, and\r\nsaid they would go to The Hague for further instructions. Thither they\r\nwent, and, after a week's absence, returned the same answer, \"That they\r\nhad no power to settle a scheme of peace; but could only discourse of\r\nit, when the difficulties of the Barrier Treaty were over.\" And Mons.\r\nBuys took a journey to Amsterdam, on purpose to stir up that city, where\r\nhe was pensionary, against yielding the Assiento to Britain; but was\r\nunsuccessful in his negotiation; the point being yielded up there, and\r\nin most other towns in Holland.\r\n\r\nIt will have an odd sound in history, and appear hardly credible, that\r\nin several petty republics of single towns, which make up the States\r\nGeneral, it should be formally debated, whether the Queen of Great\r\nBritain, who preserved the commonwealth at the charge of so many\r\nmillions, should be suffered to enjoy, after a peace, the liberty\r\ngranted her by Spain of selling African slaves in the Spanish dominions\r\nof America! But there was a prevailing faction at The Hague, violently\r\nbent against any peace, where the Queen must act that part which they\r\nhad intended for themselves. These politicians, who held constant\r\ncorrespondence with their old dejected friends in England, were daily\r\nfed with the vain hopes of the Queen's death, or the party's\r\nrestoration. They likewise endeavoured to spin out the time, till Prince\r\nEugene's activity had pushed on some great event, which might govern or\r\nperplex the conditions of peace. Therefore the Dutch plenipotentiaries,\r\nwho proceeded by the instructions of those mistaken patriots, acted in\r\nevery point with a spirit of litigiousness, than which nothing could\r\ngive greater advantage to the enemy; a strict union between the allies,\r\nbut especially Britain and Holland, being doubtless the only means for\r\nprocuring safe and honourable terms from France.\r\n\r\nBut neither was this the worst; for the Queen received undoubted\r\nintelligence from Utrecht, that the Dutch were again attempting a\r\nseparate correspondence with France. And by letters, intercepted here,\r\nfrom Vienna, it was found, that the imperial court, whose ministers were\r\nin the utmost confidence with those of Holland, expressed the most\r\nfurious rage against Her Majesty, for the steps she had taken to advance\r\na peace.\r\n\r\nThis unjustifiable treatment, the Queen could not digest from an ally,\r\nupon whom she had conferred so many signal obligations, whom she had\r\nused with so much indulgence and sincerity during the whole course of\r\nthe negotiation, and had so often invited to go along with her in every\r\nmotion towards a peace. She apprehended likewise, that the negotiation\r\nmight be taken out of her hands, if France could be secure of easier\r\nconditions in Holland, or might think that Britain wanted power to\r\ninfluence the whole confederacy. She resolved therefore, on this\r\noccasion, to exert herself with vigour, steadiness, and dispatch; and,\r\nin the beginning of May, sent her commands to the Earl of Strafford to\r\nrepair immediately to England, in order to consult with her ministers\r\nwhat was proper to be done.\r\n\r\nThe proposal above mentioned, for preventing the union of France and\r\nSpain, met with many difficulties; Mons. de Torcy raising objections\r\nagainst several parts of it. But the Queen refused to proceed any\r\nfarther with France, until this weighty point were fully settled to her\r\nsatisfaction; after which, she promised to grant a suspension of arms,\r\nprovided the town and citadel of Dunkirk might be delivered as a pledge\r\ninto her hands: and proposed that Ypres might be surrendered to the\r\nDutch, if they would consent to come into the suspension. France\r\nabsolutely refused the latter; and the States General having acted in\r\nperpetual contradiction to Her Majesty, she pressed that matter no\r\nfarther; because she doubted they would not agree to a cessation of\r\narms. However, she resolved to put a speedy end, or at least\r\nintermission, to her own share in the war: and the French having\r\ndeclared themselves ready to agree to her expedients, for preventing the\r\nunion of the two crowns, and consented to the delivery of Dunkirk;\r\npositive orders were sent to the Duke of Ormonde to avoid engaging in\r\nany battle or siege, until he had further instructions; but he was\r\ndirected to conceal his orders, and to find the best excuses he could,\r\nif any pressing occasion should offer.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this unusual proceeding, which made a mighty noise, were\r\nof sufficient weight to justify it; for, pursuant to the agreement made\r\nbetween us and France, a courier was then dispatched from Fontainebleau\r\nto Madrid, with the offer of an alternative to Philip, either of\r\nresigning Spain immediately to the Duke of Savoy, upon the hopes of\r\nsucceeding to France, and some present advantage, which, not having been\r\naccepted, is needless to dilate on; or of adhering to Spain, and\r\nrenouncing all future claim to France for himself and his posterity.\r\n\r\nUntil it could be known which part Philip would accept, the Queen would\r\nnot take possession of Dunkirk, nor suffer an armistice to be declared.\r\nBut, however, since the Most Christian King had agreed that his grandson\r\nshould be forced, in case of a refusal, to make his choice immediately,\r\nHer Majesty could not endure to think, that perhaps some thousands of\r\nlives of her own subjects and allies might be sacrificed, without\r\nnecessity, if an occasion should be found or sought for fighting a\r\nbattle; which, she very well knew, Prince Eugene would eagerly attempt,\r\nand put all into confusion, to gratify his own ambition, the enmity of\r\nhis new masters the Dutch, and the rage of his court.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke of Ormonde, who, with every other quality that can\r\naccomplish or adorn a great man, inherits all the valour and loyalty of\r\nhis ancestors, found it very difficult to acquit himself of his\r\ncommission;[6] for Prince Eugene, and all the field deputies of the\r\nStates, had begun already to talk either of attacking the enemy, or\r\nbesieging Quesnoy, the confederate army being now all joined by the\r\ntroops they expected; and accordingly, about three days after the Duke\r\nhad received those orders from court, it was proposed to his grace, at a\r\nmeeting with the prince and deputies, that the French army should be\r\nattacked, their camp having been viewed, and a great opportunity\r\noffering to do it with success; for the Marechal de Villars, who had\r\nnotice sent him by Mons. de Torcy of what was passing, and had signified\r\nthe same by a trumpet to the Duke, shewed less vigilance than was usual\r\nto that general, taking no precautions to secure his camp, or observe\r\nthe motions of the allies, probably on purpose to provoke them, the Duke\r\nsaid, \"That the Earl of Strafford's sudden departure for England, made\r\nhim believe there was something of consequence now transacting, which\r\nwould be known in four or five days; and therefore desired they would\r\ndefer this or any other undertaking, until he could receive fresh\r\nletters from England.\" Whereupon the prince and deputies immediately\r\ntold the Duke, \"That they looked for such an answer as he had given\r\nthem: That they had suspected our measures for some time, and their\r\nsuspicions were confirmed by the express his grace had so lately\r\nreceived, as well as by the negligence of Mons. Villars\". They appeared\r\nextremely dissatisfied; and the deputies told the Duke, that they would\r\nimmediately send an account of his answer to their masters, which they\r\naccordingly did; and soon after, by order from the States, wrote him an\r\nexpostulating letter, in a style less respectful than became them;\r\ndesiring him, among other things, to explain himself, whether he had\r\npositive orders not to fight the French; and afterwards told him, \"They\r\nwere sure he had such orders, otherwise he could not answer what he had\r\ndone.\" But the Duke still waived the question, saying, \"he would be glad\r\nto have letters from England, before he entered upon action, and that he\r\nexpected them daily.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: For an estimate of Ormonde's character see Swift's \"Enquiry\r\ninto the Behaviour of the Queen's Last Ministry,\" vol. v. of present\r\nedition (pp. 428-430). Ormonde had done very little to deserve\r\nsucceeding such a soldier as Marlborough. Indeed, his name was\r\nassociated with the disgraceful expedition to Cadiz, in which he was in\r\ncommand of the English troops. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nUpon this incident, the ministers and generals of the allies immediately\r\ntook the alarm, venting their fury in violent expressions against the\r\nQueen, and those she employed in her councils: said, they were betrayed\r\nby Britain, and assumed the countenance of those who think they have\r\nreceived an injury, and are disposed to return it.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Ormonde's army consisted of eighteen thousand of Her\r\nMajesty's subjects, and about thirty thousand hired from other princes,\r\neither wholly by the Queen, or jointly by her and the States. The Duke\r\nimmediately informed the court of the dispositions he found among the\r\nforeign generals upon this occasion; and that, upon an exigency, he\r\ncould only depend on the British troops adhering to him; those of\r\nHanover having already determined to desert to the Dutch, and tempted\r\nthe Danes to do the like, and that he had reason to suppose the same of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nUpon the news arriving at Utrecht, that the Duke of Ormonde had refused\r\nto engage in any action against the enemy, the Dutch ministers there\r\nwent immediately to make their complaints to the lord privy seal;\r\naggravating the strangeness of this proceeding, together with the\r\nconsequence of it, in the loss of a most favourable opportunity for\r\nruining the French army, and the discontent it must needs create in the\r\nwhole body of the confederates. Adding, how hard it was that they should\r\nbe kept in the dark, and have no communication of what was done in a\r\npoint which so nearly concerned them. They concluded, that the Duke must\r\nneeds have acted by orders; and desired his lordship to write both to\r\ncourt, and to his grace, what they had now said.\r\n\r\nThe bishop answered, \"That he knew nothing of this fact, but what they\r\nhad told him; and therefore was not prepared with a reply to their\r\nrepresentations: only, in general, he could venture to say, that this\r\ncase appeared very like the conduct of their field-deputies upon former\r\noccasions: That if such orders were given, they were certainly built\r\nupon very justifiable foundations, and would soon be so explained as to\r\nconvince the States, and all the world, that the common interest would\r\nbe better provided for another way, than by a battle or siege: That the\r\nwant of communication which they complained of, could not make the\r\nStates so uneasy as their declining to receive it had made the Queen,\r\nwho had used her utmost endeavours to persuade them to concur with her\r\nin concerting every step towards a general peace, and settling such a\r\nplan as both sides might approve and adhere to; but, to this day, the\r\nStates had not thought fit to accept those offers, or to authorize any\r\nof their ministers to treat with Her Majesty's plenipotentiaries upon\r\nthat affair, although they had been pressed to it ever since the\r\nnegotiation began: That his lordship, to shew that he did not speak his\r\nprivate sense alone, took this opportunity to execute the orders he had\r\nreceived the evening before, by declaring to them, that all Her\r\nMajesty's offers for adjusting the differences between her and the\r\nStates were founded upon this express condition, That they should come\r\nimmediately into the Queen's measures, and act openly and sincerely with\r\nher; and that, from their conduct, so directly contrary, she now looked\r\nupon herself to be under no obligation to them.\"\r\n\r\nMons. Buys and his colleagues were stunned with this declaration, made\r\nto them at a time when they pretended to think the right of complaining\r\nto be on their side, and had come to the bishop upon that errand. But\r\nafter their surprise was abated, and Buys's long reasonings at an end,\r\nthey began to think how matters might be retrieved; and were of opinion,\r\nthat the States should immediately dispatch a minister to England,\r\nunless his lordship were empowered to treat with them; which, without\r\nnew commands, he said he was not. They afterwards desired to know of the\r\nbishop, what the meaning was of the last words in his declaration, \"That\r\nHer Majesty looked upon herself to be under no obligation to them.\" He\r\ntold them his opinion, \"That as the Queen was bound by treaty to concert\r\nwith the States the conditions of a peace, so, upon their declining the\r\nconcert so frequently offered, she was acquitted of that obligation: but\r\nthat he verily believed, whatever measures Her Majesty should take, she\r\nwould always have a friendly regard to the interest of their\r\ncommonwealth; and that as their unkindness had been very unexpected and\r\ndisagreeable to Her Majesty, so their compliance would be equally\r\npleasing.\"\r\n\r\nI have been the more circumstantial in relating this affair, because it\r\nfurnished abundance of discourse, and gave rise to many wild conjectures\r\nand misrepresentations, as well here as in Holland, especially that part\r\nwhich concerned the Duke of Ormonde;[7] for the angry faction in the\r\nHouse of Commons, upon the first intelligence, that the Duke had\r\ndeclined to act offensively against France, in concurrence with the\r\nallies, moved for an address, wherein the Queen should be informed of\r\n\"the deep concern of her Commons for the dangerous consequences to the\r\ncommon cause, which must arise from this proceeding of her general; and\r\nto beseech her, that speedy instructions might be given to the Duke to\r\nprosecute the war with vigour, in order to quiet the minds of her\r\npeople, &c.\" But a great majority was against this motion, and a\r\nresolution drawn up and presented to the Queen by the whole House of a\r\nquite contrary tenor, \"That they had an entire confidence in Her\r\nMajesty's most gracious promise, to communicate to her Parliament the\r\nterms of the peace, before the same should be concluded; and that they\r\nwould support Her Majesty, in obtaining an honourable and safe peace,\r\nagainst all such persons, either at home or abroad, who have\r\nendeavoured, or shall endeavour, to obstruct the same.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This determination on the part of England to cease\r\nhostilities at this juncture has been most severely criticized. The\r\nmatter formed, afterwards, the chief article in the impeachment of\r\nBolingbroke, and an important article in the impeachment of Oxford.\r\nAccording to the \"Report of the Committee of Secrecy,\" and the Earl of\r\nOxford's answer to this charge in his impeachment, it seems as if St.\r\nJohn had instructed Ormonde so to act, without in any way consulting the\r\ncouncil, and apparently purposely concealing the fact from his\r\ncolleagues. Mr. Walter Sichel, however, in a note on p. 380 of his\r\n\"Bolingbroke and his Times,\" clearly traces the order to the desire of\r\nthe Queen herself, and in his text lays on the Queen the blame that was\r\nvisited on the heads of her ministers. See also note on p. 156. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe courier sent with the alternative to Spain was now returned, with an\r\naccount that Philip had chosen to renounce France for himself and his\r\nposterity, whereof the Queen having received notice, Her Majesty, upon\r\nthe sixth of June, in a long speech to both Houses of Parliament, laid\r\nbefore them the terms of a general peace, stipulated between her and\r\nFrance. This speech, being the plan whereby both France and the allies\r\nhave been obliged to proceed in the subsequent course of the treaty, I\r\nshall desire the reader's leave to insert it at length, although I\r\nbelieve it hath been already in most hands.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This speech was printed by John Baskett, 1712. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\"MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n\"The making peace and war is the undoubted prerogative of the crown; yet\r\nsuch is the just confidence I place in you, that at the opening of this\r\nsession, I acquainted you that a negotiation for a general peace was\r\nbegun; and afterwards, by messages, I promised to communicate to you the\r\nterms of peace, before the same should be concluded.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuance of that promise, I now come to let you know upon what\r\nterms a general peace may be made.\r\n\r\n\"I need not mention the difficulties which arise from the very nature of\r\nthis affair; and it is but too apparent, that these difficulties have\r\nbeen increased by other obstructions, artfully contrived to hinder this\r\ngreat and good work.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, however, has moved me from steadily pursuing, in the first\r\nplace, the true interests of my own kingdoms, and I have not omitted any\r\nthing, which might procure to all our allies what is due to them by\r\ntreaties, and what is necessary for their security.\r\n\r\n\"The assuring of the Protestant succession, as by law established in the\r\nHouse of Hanover, to these kingdoms; being what I have nearest at heart,\r\nparticular care is taken not only to have that acknowledged in the\r\nstrongest terms, but to have an additional security, by the removal of\r\nthat person out of the dominions of France, who has pretended to disturb\r\nthis settlement.\r\n\r\n\"The apprehension that Spain and the West Indies might be united to\r\nFrance, was the chief inducement to begin this war; and the effectual\r\npreventing of such an union, was the principle I laid down at the\r\ncommencement of this treaty. Former examples, and the late negotiations,\r\nsufficiently shew how difficult it is to find means to accomplish this\r\nwork. I would not content myself with such as are speculative, or depend\r\non treaties only: I insisted on what was solid, and to have at hand the\r\npower of executing what should be agreed.\r\n\r\n\"I can therefore now tell you, that France at last is brought to offer,\r\nthat the Duke of Anjou shall, for himself and his descendants, renounce\r\nfor ever all claim to the crown of France; and that this important\r\narticle may be exposed to no hazard, the performance is to accompany the\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time the succession to the crown of France is to be\r\ndeclared, after the death of the present dauphin and his sons, to be in\r\nthe Duke of Berry and his sons, in the Duke of Orleans and his sons, and\r\nso on to the rest of the House of Bourbon.\r\n\r\n\"As to Spain and the Indies, the succession to those dominions, after\r\nthe Duke of Anjou and his children, is to descend to such prince as\r\nshall be agreed upon at the treaty, for ever excluding the rest of the\r\nHouse of Bourbon.\r\n\r\n\"For confirming the renunciations and settlements before mentioned, it\r\nis further offered, that they should be ratified in the most strong and\r\nsolemn manner, both in France and Spain; and that those kingdoms, as\r\nwell as all the other powers engaged in the present war, shall be\r\nguarantees to the same.\r\n\r\n\"The nature of this proposal is such, that it executes itself: the\r\ninterest of Spain is to support it; and in France, the persons to whom\r\nthat succession is to belong, will be ready and powerful enough to\r\nvindicate their own right.\r\n\r\n\"France and Spain are now more effectually divided than ever. And thus,\r\nby the blessing of God, will a real balance of power be fixed in Europe,\r\nand remain liable to as few accidents as human affairs can be exempted\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\"A treaty of commerce between these kingdoms and France has been entered\r\nupon; but the excessive duties laid on some goods, and the prohibitions\r\nof others, make it impossible to finish this work so soon as were to be\r\ndesired. Care is however taken to establish a method of settling this\r\nmatter; and in the mean time provision is made, that the same privileges\r\nand advantages, as shall be granted to any other nation by France, shall\r\nbe granted in like manner to us.\r\n\r\n\"The division of the Island of St. Christopher, between us and the\r\nFrench, having been the cause of great inconveniency and damage to my\r\nsubjects, I have demanded to have an absolute cession made to me of that\r\nwhole island, and France agrees to this demand.\r\n\r\n\"Our interest is so deeply concerned in the trade of North America, that\r\nI have used my utmost endeavours to adjust that article in the most\r\nbeneficial manner. France consents to restore to us the whole Bay and\r\nStraits of Hudson, to deliver up the Island of Newfoundland, with\r\nPlacentia; and to make an absolute cession of Annapolis, with the rest\r\nof Nova Scotia, or Acadie.\r\n\r\n\"The safety of our home trade will be better provided for, by the\r\ndemolition of Dunkirk.\r\n\r\n\"Our Mediterranean trade, and the British interest and influence in\r\nthose parts, will be secured by the possession of Gibraltar and Port\r\nMahon, with the whole island of Minorca, which are offered to remain in\r\nmy hands.\r\n\r\n\"The trade to Spain and to the West Indies may in general be settled, as\r\nit was in the time of the late King of Spain, Charles the Second; and a\r\nparticular provision be made, that all advantages, rights, or\r\nprivileges, which have been granted, or which may hereafter be granted,\r\nby Spain to any other nation, shall be in like manner granted to the\r\nsubjects of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"But the part which we have borne in the prosecution of this war,\r\nentitling us to some distinction in the terms of peace, I have insisted,\r\nand obtained, that the Assiento, or contract for furnishing the Spanish\r\nWest Indies with negroes, shall be made with us for the term of thirty\r\nyears, in the same manner as it has been enjoyed by the French for ten\r\nyears past.\r\n\r\n\"I have not taken upon me to determine the interests of our\r\nconfederates; these must be adjusted in the congress at Utrecht, where\r\nmy best endeavours shall be employed, as they have hitherto constantly\r\nbeen, to procure to every one of them all just and reasonable\r\nsatisfaction. In the mean time, I think it proper to acquaint you, that\r\nFrance offers to make the Rhine the barrier of the empire; to yield\r\nBrissac, the fort of Kehl, and Landau, and to raze all the fortresses,\r\nboth on the other side of the Rhine, and in that river.\r\n\r\n\"As to the Protestant interest in Germany, there will be on the part of\r\nFrance no objection to the resettling thereof, on the foot of the treaty\r\nof Westphalia.\r\n\r\n\"The Spanish Low Countries may go to his Imperial Majesty: the kingdoms\r\nof Naples and Sardinia, the duchy of Milan, and the places belonging to\r\nSpain on the coast of Tuscany, may likewise be yielded by the treaty of\r\npeace to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\"As to the kingdom of Sicily, though there remains no dispute concerning\r\nthe cession of it by the Duke of Anjou, yet the disposition thereof is\r\nnot yet determined.\r\n\r\n\"The interests of the States General, with respect to commerce, are\r\nagreed to, as they have been demanded by their own ministers, with the\r\nexception only of some very few species of merchandise; and the entire\r\nbarrier, as demanded by the States in one thousand seven hundred and\r\nnine from France, except two or three places at most.\r\n\r\n\"As to these exceptions, several expedients are proposed; and I make no\r\ndoubt but this barrier may be so settled, as to render that republic\r\nperfectly secure against any enterprise on the part of France; which is\r\nthe foundation of all my engagements upon this head with the States.\r\n\r\n\"The demands of Portugal depending on the disposition of Spain, and that\r\narticle having been long in dispute, it has not been yet possible to\r\nmake any considerable progress therein; but my plenipotentiaries will\r\nnow have an opportunity to assist that king in his pretensions.\r\n\r\n\"Those of the King of Prussia are such as, I hope, will admit of little\r\ndifficulty on the part of France; and my utmost endeavours shall not be\r\nwanting to procure all I am able to so good an ally.\r\n\r\n\"The difference between the barrier demanded for the Duke of Savoy in\r\none thousand seven hundred and nine, and the offers now made by France,\r\nis very inconsiderable: but that prince having so signally distinguished\r\nhimself in the service of the common cause, I am endeavouring to procure\r\nfor him still farther advantages.\r\n\r\n\"France has consented, that the Elector Palatine shall continue his\r\npresent rank among the electors, and remain in possession of the Upper\r\nPalatinate.\r\n\r\n\"The electoral dignity is likewise acknowledged in the House of Hanover,\r\naccording to the article inserted at that prince's desire in my demands.\r\n\r\n\"And as to the rest of the allies, I make no doubt of being able to\r\nsecure their several interests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n\"I have now communicated to you, not only the terms of peace, which may,\r\nby the future treaty, be obtained for my own subjects; but likewise the\r\nproposals of France, for satisfying our allies.\r\n\r\n\"The former are such as I have reason to expect, to make my people some\r\namends for that great and unequal burden which they have lain under,\r\nthrough the whole course of this war; and I am willing to hope, that\r\nnone of our confederates, and especially those to whom so great\r\naccessions of dominion and power are to accrue by this peace, will envy\r\nBritain her share in the glory and advantage of it.\r\n\r\n\"The latter are not yet so perfectly adjusted, as a little more time\r\nmight have rendered them; but the season of the year making it necessary\r\nto put an end to this session, I resolved no longer to defer\r\ncommunicating these matters to you.\r\n\r\n\"I can make no doubt but you are all fully persuaded, that nothing will\r\nbe neglected on my part, in the progress of this negotiation, to bring\r\nthe peace to an happy and speedy issue; and I depend on your entire\r\nconfidence in me, and your cheerful concurrence with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe discontented party in the House of Commons, finding the torrent\r\nagainst them not to be stemmed, suspended their opposition; by which\r\nmeans an address was voted, _nemine contradicente_, to acknowledge Her\r\nMajesty's condescension, to express their satisfaction in what she had\r\nalready done, and to desire she would please to proceed with the present\r\nnegotiations for obtaining a speedy peace.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions at home, the Duke of Ormonde[8] was in a very\r\nuneasy situation at the army, employed in practising those arts which\r\nperhaps are fitter for a subtle negotiator than a great commander.[9]\r\nBut as he had always proved his obedience, where courage or conduct\r\ncould be of use; so the duty he professed to his prince, made him submit\r\nto continue in a state of inactivity at the head of his troops, however\r\ncontrary to his nature, if it were for Her Majesty's service. He had\r\nsent early notice to the ministers, that he could not depend upon the\r\nforeign forces in the Queen's pay, and he now found some attempts were\r\nalready begun to seduce them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: James Butler, Duke of Ormonde, succeeded his grandfather in\r\nthat title in July, 1688, was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1703, and\r\nagain in 1710. He succeeded the Duke of Marlborough as captain general,\r\nand had the first regiment of Guards. Bishop Burnet says, \"he had the\r\nsame allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the Duke of\r\nMarlborough.\" (\"History,\" vol. ii., p. 602). [N.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Bolingbroke had written a letter to Ormonde (dated May\r\n10th, 1712) in which he informed the commander-in-chief that it was the\r\n\"Queen's positive command to your Grace, that you avoid engaging in any\r\nsiege or hazarding a battle till you have farther orders from Her\r\nMajesty.\" How to do this with dignity was not an easy matter. The\r\ncontinuation of this letter from Bolingbroke suggested the spirit,\r\nthough it left to Ormonde the details of his procedure in so delicate a\r\nsituation: \"I am, at the same time, directed to let your Grace know that\r\nthe Queen would have you disguise the receipt of this order; and her\r\nMajesty thinks that you cannot want pretences for conducting yourself so\r\nas to answer her ends, without owning that which might at present have\r\nan ill effect if it was publicly known.\" (Bolingbroke, \"Correspondence,\"\r\nii. 320). This is what Swift means by being: \"employed in practicing\r\nthose arts which perhaps are fitter for a subtle negotiator than a great\r\ncommander.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nWhile the courier was expected from Madrid, the Duke had orders to\r\ninform the Maréchal de Villars of the true state of this affair; and\r\nthat his grace would have decisive orders in three or four days. In the\r\nmean time, he desired the marechal would not oblige him to come to any\r\naction, either to defend himself, or to join with Prince Eugene's army;\r\nwhich he must necessarily do, if the prince were attacked.\r\n\r\nWhen the courier was arrived with the account, that Philip had chosen to\r\naccept of Spain, Her Majesty had proposed to France a suspension of arms\r\nfor two months (to be prolonged to three or four), between the armies\r\nnow in Flanders, upon the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\"That, during the suspension, endeavours should be used for concluding a\r\ngeneral peace; or, at least, the article for preventing the union of\r\nFrance and Spain, should be punctually executed by Philip's renouncing\r\nFrance, for himself and his posterity; and the princes of Bourbon, in\r\nlike manner, renouncing Spain: and that the town, citadel, and forts of\r\nDunkirk, should be immediately delivered into the Queen's hands.\" Her\r\nMajesty at the same time endeavoured to get Cambray for the Dutch,\r\nprovided they would come into the suspension. But this was absolutely\r\nrejected by France; which that court would never have ventured to do, if\r\nthose allies could have been prevailed on to have acted with sincerity\r\nand openness in concert with Her Majesty, as her plenipotentiaries had\r\nalways desired. However, the Queen promised, that, if the States would\r\nyield to a suspension of arms, they should have some valuable pledge put\r\ninto their possession.\r\n\r\nBut now fresh intelligence daily arrived, both from Utrecht and the\r\narmy, of attempts to make the troops in Her Majesty's pay desert her\r\nservice; and a design even of seizing the British forces, was whispered\r\nabout, and with reason suspected.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen's speech was published in Holland, the lord privy seal\r\ntold the Dutch ministers at Utrecht, \"That what Her Majesty had laid\r\nbefore her Parliament could not, according to the rules of treaty, be\r\nlooked on as the utmost of what France would yield in the course of a\r\nnegotiation; but only the utmost of what that crown would propose, in\r\norder to form the plan of a peace: That these conditions would certainly\r\nhave been better, if the States had thought fit to have gone hand in\r\nhand with Her Majesty, as she had so frequently exhorted them to do:\r\nThat nothing but the want of harmony among the allies had spirited the\r\nFrench to stand out so long: That the Queen would do them all the good\r\noffices in her power, if they thought fit to comply; and did not doubt\r\nof getting them reasonable satisfaction, both in relation to their\r\nbarrier and their trade.\" But this reasoning made no impression: the\r\nDutch ministers said, the Queen's speech had deprived them of the fruits\r\nof the war. They were in pain, lest Lille and Tournay might be two of\r\nthe towns to be excepted out of their barrier. The rest of the allies\r\ngrew angry, by the example of the Dutch. The populace in Holland began\r\nto be inflamed: they publicly talked, that Britain had betrayed them.\r\nSermons were preached in several towns of their provinces, whether by\r\ndirection or connivance, filled with the highest instances of disrespect\r\nto Her Britannic Majesty, whom they charged as a papist, and an enemy to\r\ntheir country. The lord privy seal himself believed something\r\nextraordinary was in agitation, and that his own person was in danger\r\nfrom the fury of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that the States appeared but a few days before very much\r\ndisposed to comply with the measures the Queen had taken, and would have\r\nconsented to a general armistice, if Count Zinzendorf, one of the\r\nplenipotentiaries for the Emperor, had not, by direct orders from his\r\ncourt, employed himself in sowing jealousies between Britain and the\r\nStates; and at the same time made prodigious offers to the latter, as\r\nwell as to the ministers of Prussia, the Palatinate, and Hanover, for\r\ncontinuing the war. That those three electors, who contributed nothing,\r\nexcept bodies of men in return of pay and subsidies, should readily\r\naccept the proposals of the Emperor, is easy to be accounted for. What\r\nappears hardly credible is, that a grave republic, usually cautious\r\nenough in making their bargains, should venture to reject the thoughts\r\nof a peace upon the promises of the House of Austria, the little\r\nvalidity whereof they had so long experienced; and especially when they\r\ncounted upon losing the support of Britain, their most powerful ally;\r\nbut the false hopes given them by their friends in England of some new\r\nchange in their favour, or an imagination of bringing France to better\r\nterms by the appearance of resolution, added to the weakness or\r\ncorruption of some, who administered their affairs, were the true causes\r\nwhich first created, and afterwards inflamed, this untractable temper\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch ministers were wholly disconcerted and surprised, when the\r\nlord privy seal told them, \"That a suspension of arms in the Netherlands\r\nwould be necessary; and that the Duke of Ormonde intended very soon to\r\ndeclare it after he had taken possession of Dunkirk.\" But his lordship\r\nendeavoured to convince them, that this incident ought rather to be a\r\nmotive for hastening the States into a compliance with Her Majesty. He\r\nlikewise communicated to the ministers of the allies the offers made by\r\nFrance, as delivered in the speech from the throne, which Her Majesty\r\nthought to be satisfactory, and hoped their masters would concur with\r\nher in bringing the peace to a speedy conclusion, wherein each, in\r\nparticular, might be assured of her best offices for advancing their\r\njust pretensions.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Duke of Ormonde was directed to send a body of\r\ntroops to take possession of Dunkirk, as soon as he should have notice\r\nfrom the Maréchal de Villars, that the commandant of the town had\r\nreceived orders from his court to deliver it; but the Duke foresaw many\r\ndifficulties in the executing of this commission. He could trust such an\r\nenterprise to no forces, except those of Her Majesty's own subjects. He\r\nconsidered the temper of the States in this conjuncture, and was loth to\r\ndivide a small body of men, upon whose faithfulness alone he could\r\ndepend. He thought it not prudent to expose them to march through the\r\nenemy's country, with whom there was yet neither peace nor truce; and he\r\nhad sufficient reasons to apprehend, that the Dutch would either not\r\npermit such a detachment to pass through their towns (as themselves had\r\nmore than hinted to him) or would seize them as they passed: besides,\r\nthe Duke had very fairly signified to Maréchal de Villars, that he\r\nexpected to be deserted by all the foreign troops in Her Majesty's pay,\r\nas soon as the armistice should be declared; at which the maréchal\r\nappearing extremely disappointed, said, \"The King his master reckoned,\r\nthat all the troops under his grace's command should yield to the\r\ncessation; and wondered how it should come to pass, that those who might\r\nbe paid for lying still, would rather choose, after a ten years' war, to\r\nenter into the service of new masters, under whom they must fight on for\r\nnothing.\" In short, the opinion of Mons. Villars was, that this\r\ndifficulty cancelled the promise of surrendering Dunkirk; which\r\ntherefore he opposed as much as possible, in the letters he writ to his\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nUpon the Duke of Ormonde's representing those difficulties, the Queen\r\naltered her measures, and ordered forces to be sent from England to take\r\npossession of Dunkirk. The Duke was likewise commanded to tell the\r\nforeign generals in Her Majesty's service, how highly she would resent\r\ntheir desertion; after which, their masters must give up all thoughts of\r\nany arrears, either of pay or subsidy. The lord privy seal spoke the\r\nsame language at Utrecht, to the several ministers of the allies; as Mr.\r\nSecretary St. John did to those who resided here; adding, \"That the\r\nproceeding of the foreign troops would be looked upon as a declaration\r\nfor or against Her Majesty: and that, in case they desert her service,\r\nshe would look on herself as justified, before God and man, to continue\r\nher negotiation at Utrecht, or any other place, whether the allies\r\nconcur or not.\" And particularly the Dutch were assured, \"That if their\r\nmasters seduced the forces hired by the Queen, they must take the whole\r\npay, arrears, and subsidies on themselves.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Compare this language of Bishop Robinson with the letter\r\nBolingbroke had previously written to Thomas Harley (letter of May 17,\r\n1712): \"On the report which my Lord Strafford, who arrived here the day\r\nbefore yesterday, has made by word of mouth, as well as upon the\r\ncontents of the latter dispatches from Utrecht, her Majesty is fully\r\ndetermined to let all negotiations sleep in Holland; since they have\r\nneither sense, nor gratitude, nor spirit enough to make a suitable\r\nreturn to the offers lately sent by the Queen, and communicated by the\r\nplenipotentiaries, her Majesty will look on herself as under no\r\nobligation towards them, but proceed to make the peace either with or\r\nwithout them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the States-General addressed a complaint to the Queen of the manner\r\nin which England was deserting them, Bolingbroke had their letter\r\nformally condemned by a resolution of the House of Commons. He was\r\ndetermined to bring this peace about, and the Dutch might \"kick and\r\nflounce like wild beasts caught in a toil; yet the cords are too strong\r\nfor them to break.\" (Report from the Committee of Secrecy.) [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Strafford, preparing about this time to return to Utrecht,\r\nwith instructions proper to the present situation of affairs, went first\r\nto the army, and there informed the Duke of Ormonde of Her Majesty's\r\nintentions. He also acquainted the States deputies with the Queen's\r\nuneasiness, lest, by the measures they were taking, they should drive\r\nher to extremities, which she desired so much to avoid. He farther\r\nrepresented to them, in the plainest terms, the provocations Her Majesty\r\nhad received, and the grounds and reasons for her present conduct. He\r\nlikewise declared to the commanders in chief of the foreign troops, in\r\nthe Queen's pay, and in the joint pay of Britain and the States, with\r\nhow much surprise Her Majesty had heard, \"That there was the least doubt\r\nof their obeying the orders of the Duke of Ormonde; which if they\r\nrefused, Her Majesty would esteem it not only as an indignity and\r\naffront, but as a declaration against her; and, in such a case, they\r\nmust look on themselves as no farther entitled either to any arrear, or\r\nfuture pay or subsidies.\"\r\n\r\nSix regiments, under the command of Mr. Hill,[11] were now preparing to\r\nembark, in order to take possession of Dunkirk; and the Duke of Ormonde,\r\nupon the first intelligence sent him, that the French were ready to\r\ndeliver the town, was to declare he could act no longer against France.\r\nThe Queen gave notice immediately of her proceedings to the States. She\r\nlet them plainly know, \"That their perpetual caballing with her factious\r\nsubjects, against her authority, had forced her into such measures, as\r\notherwise she would not have engaged in. However, Her Majesty was\r\nwilling yet to forget all that had passed, and to unite with them in the\r\nstrictest ties of amity, which she hoped they would now do; since they\r\ncould not but be convinced, by the late dutiful addresses of both\r\nHouses, how far their High Mightinesses had been deluded, and drawn in\r\nas instruments to serve the turn, and gratify the passions, of a\r\ndisaffected party: That their opposition, and want of concert with Her\r\nMajesty's ministers, which she had so often invited them to, had\r\nencouraged France to except towns out of their barrier, which otherwise\r\nmight have been yielded: That, however, she had not precluded them, or\r\nany other ally, from demanding more; and even her own terms were but\r\nconditional, upon supposition of a general peace to ensue: That Her\r\nMajesty resolved to act upon the plan laid down in her speech;\" and she\r\nrepeated the promise of her best offices to promote the interest of the\r\nStates, if they would deal sincerely with her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: John Hill, brother to Mrs. Masham. It is not difficult to\r\nguess at the reason for this appointment. Here was a chance for Jack\r\nHill to achieve some glory and wipe away the disgrace of the ill-starred\r\nQuebec expedition. As there was also no danger attached to the\r\nenterprise, all the more likely that he would succeed. Hill sailed with\r\nAdmiral Sir John Leake and took peaceable possession of the town and\r\nforts. For this he was appointed Governor of Dunkirk, and while there he\r\nsent Swift a gold snuff-box as a present, \"the finest that ever you\r\nsaw,\" as Swift wrote to Stella: See also vol. v., p. 80, of this\r\nedition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nSome days before the Duke of Ormonde had notice, that orders were given\r\nfor the surrender of Dunkirk, Prince Eugene of Savoy sent for the\r\ngenerals of the allies, and asked them severally, whether, in case the\r\narmies separated, they would march with him, or stay with the Duke? All\r\nof them, except two, who commanded but small bodies, agreed to join with\r\nthe prince; who thereupon, about three days after, sent the Duke word,\r\nthat he intended to march the following day (as it was supposed) to\r\nbesiege Landrecies. The Duke returned an answer, \"That he was surprised\r\nat the prince's message, there having been not the least previous\r\nconcert with him, nor any mention in the message, which way, or upon\r\nwhat design, the march was intended: therefore, that the Duke could not\r\nresolve to march with him; much less could the prince expect assistance\r\nfrom the Queen's army, in any design undertaken after this manner.\" The\r\nDuke told this beforehand, that he (the prince) might take his measures\r\naccordingly, and not attribute to Her Majesty's general any misfortune\r\nthat might happen.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of July, N.S. the several generals of the allies joined\r\nPrince Eugene's army, and began their march, after taking leave of the\r\nDuke and the Earl of Strafford, whose expostulations could not prevail\r\non them to stay; although the latter assured them, that the Queen had\r\nmade neither peace nor truce with France, and that her forces would now\r\nbe left exposed to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe next day after this famous desertion, the Duke of Ormonde received a\r\nletter from Mons. de Villars, with an account, that the town and citadel\r\nof Dunkirk should be delivered to Mr. Hill. Whereupon a cessation of\r\narms was declared, by sound of trumpet, at the head of the British army;\r\nwhich now consisted only of about eighteen thousand men, all of Her\r\nMajesty's subjects, except the Holsteiners, and Count Wallis's\r\ndragoons.[12] With this small body of men the general began his march;\r\nand, pursuant to orders from court, retired towards the sea, in the\r\nmanner he thought most convenient for the Queen's service. When he came\r\nas far as Flines, he was told by some of his officers, that the\r\ncommandants of Bouchain, Douay, Lille, and Tournay, had refused them\r\npassage through those towns, or even liberty of entrance, and said it\r\nwas by order of their masters.[13] The Duke immediately recollected,\r\nthat when the deputies first heard of his resolution to withdraw his\r\ntroops, they told him, they hoped he did not intend to march through any\r\nof their towns. This made him conclude, that the orders must be general,\r\nand that his army would certainly meet with the same treatment which his\r\nofficers had done. He had likewise, before the armies separated,\r\nreceived information of some designs that concerned the safety, or at\r\nleast the freedom of his own person, and (which he much more valued)\r\nthat of those few British troops entrusted to his care. No general was\r\never more truly or deservedly beloved by his soldiers, who, to a man,\r\nwere prepared to sacrifice their lives in his service; and whose\r\nresentments were raised to the utmost, by the ingratitude, as they\r\ntermed it, of their deserters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Barner, who commanded the troops of Holstein, being two\r\nbattalions and eight squadrons, and Walef or Waless, who commanded the\r\ndragoons of Liège, both followed Ormonde. [S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: At Bouchain, the British officers were told at the gates,\r\nthat the commandant had positive orders to let no Englishman into the\r\ntown; and at Douay, where the English had large stores and magazines,\r\nthe same thing happened with considerable aggravation. Indeed, it was\r\nwith difficulty and precaution that the commandant of the latter town\r\nwould permit the body of an English colonel to be interred there. The\r\nsame difficulties occurred at Tournay, Oudenarde, and Lille; and the\r\nDuke of Ormonde having sent an officer express to England on the 17th,\r\nhe was stopped and interrupted at Haspre, misguided at Courtray, and\r\nrefused admission at Bruges. (See \"The Conduct of his Grace the Duke of\r\nOrmonde, in the Campagne of 1712,\" 1715, pp. 46-50.) [S.]]\r\n\r\nUpon these provocations, he laid aside all thoughts of returning to\r\nDunkirk, and began to consider how he might perform, in so difficult a\r\nconjuncture, something important to the Queen, and at the same time find\r\na secure retreat for his forces. He formed his plan without\r\ncommunicating it to any person whatsoever; and the disposition of the\r\narmy being to march towards Warneton, in the way to Dunkirk, he gave\r\nsudden orders to Lieutenant-General Cadogan to change his route,\r\naccording to the military phrase, and move towards Orchies, a town\r\nleading directly to Ghent.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Eugene and the States deputies received news of the Duke's\r\nmotions, they were alarmed to the utmost degree, and sent Count Nassau,\r\nof Woudenbourg, to the general's camp near Orchies, to excuse what had\r\nbeen done, and to assure his grace, that those commandants, who had\r\nrefused passage to his officers, had acted wholly without orders. Count\r\nHompesch, one of the Dutch generals, came likewise to the Duke with the\r\nsame story; but all this made little impression on the general, who held\r\non his march, and on the twenty-third of July, N.S., entered Ghent,\r\nwhere he was received with great submission by the inhabitants, and took\r\npossession of the town, as he likewise did of Bruges, a few days after.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Ormonde thought, that considering the present disposition of\r\nthe States towards Britain, it might be necessary for the Queen to have\r\nsome pledge from that republic in her hands, as well as from France, by\r\nwhich means Her Majesty would be empowered to act the part that best\r\nbecame her, of being mediator at least; and that while Ghent was in the\r\nQueen's hands, no provisions could pass the Scheldt or the Lys without\r\nher permission, by which he had it in his power to starve their army.\r\nThe possession of these towns might likewise teach the Dutch and\r\nImperialists, to preserve a degree of decency and civility to Her\r\nMajesty, which both of them were upon some occasions too apt to forget:\r\nand besides, there was already in the town of Ghent, a battalion of\r\nBritish troops and a detachment of five hundred men in the citadel,\r\ntogether with a great quantity of ammunition stores for the service of\r\nthe war, which would certainly have been seized or embezzled; so that no\r\nservice could be more seasonable or useful in the present juncture than\r\nthis, which the Queen highly approved, and left the Duke a discretionary\r\npower to act as he thought fit on any future emergency.\r\n\r\nI have a little interrupted the order of time, in relating the Duke of\r\nOrmonde's proceedings, who, after having placed a garrison at Bruges,\r\nand sent a supply of men and ammunition to Dunkirk, retired to Ghent,\r\nwhere he continued some months, till he had leave to return to England.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Colonel Disney[14] at court, with an account that\r\nMr. Hill had taken possession of Dunkirk, an universal joy spread over\r\nthe kingdom, this event being looked on as the certain forerunner of a\r\npeace: besides, the French faith was in so ill a reputation among us,\r\nthat many persons, otherwise sanguine enough, could never bring\r\nthemselves to believe, that the town would be delivered, till certain\r\nintelligence came that it was actually in our hands. Neither were the\r\nministers themselves altogether at ease, or free from suspicion,\r\nwhatever countenance they made; for they knew very well, that the French\r\nKing had many plausible reasons to elude his promise, if he found cause\r\nto repent it. One condition of surrendering Dunkirk, being a general\r\narmistice of all the troops in the British pay, which Her Majesty was\r\nnot able to perform; and upon this failure, the Maréchal de Villars (as\r\nwe have before related) endeavoured to dissuade his court from accepting\r\nthe conditions: and in the very interval, while those difficulties were\r\nadjusting, the Maréchal d'Uxelles, one of the French plenipotentiaries\r\nat Utrecht (whose inclinations, as well as those of his colleague Mons.\r\nMesnager, led him to favour the States more than Britain) assured the\r\nlord privy seal, that the Dutch were then pressing to enter into\r\nseparate measures with his master: and his lordship, in a visit to the\r\nAbbé de Polignac, observing a person to withdraw as he entered the\r\nabbé's chamber, was told by this minister, that the person he saw was\r\none Molo, of Amsterdam, mentioned before, a famous agent for the States\r\nwith France, who had been entertaining him (the abbé) upon the same\r\nsubject, but that he had refused to treat with Molo, without the privity\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Colonel Disney or Desnée, called \"Duke\" Disney, was one of\r\nthe members of the Brothers Club, a boon companion of Bolingbroke, and,\r\nas Swift says, \"not an old man, but an old rake.\" From various sources\r\nwe gather that he was a high liver, and not very nice in his ways of\r\nhigh living. In spite, however, of his undoubted profligacy, he must\r\nhave been a man of good nature and a kindly heart, since he received\r\naffectionate record from Gay, Pope, and Swift. Mr. Walter Sichel quotes\r\nfrom \"an unfinished sketch of a larger poem,\" by Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontagu, in which Disney's worst characteristics are held up to\r\nridicule. (\"Bolingbroke and his Times,\" pp. 288-290). Swift often refers\r\nto him in his \"Journal.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nMr. Harley, whom we mentioned above to have been sent early in the\r\nspring to Utrecht, continued longer in Holland than was at first\r\nexpected; but having received Her Majesty's farther instructions, was\r\nabout this time arrived at Hanover. It was the misfortune of his\r\nElectoral Highness, to be very ill served by Mons. Bothmar, his envoy\r\nhere, who assisted at all the factious meetings of the discontented\r\nparty, and deceived his master by a false representation of the kingdom,\r\ndrawn from the opinion of those to whom he confined his conversation.\r\nThere was likewise at the Elector's court a little Frenchman, without\r\nany merit or consequence, called Robethon,[15] who, by the assistance\r\nand encouragement of the last ministry, had insinuated himself into some\r\ndegree of that prince's favour, which he used in giving his master the\r\nworst impressions he was able, of those whom the Queen employed in her\r\nservice; insinuating, that the present ministers were not in the\r\ninterest of his Highness's family; that their views were towards the\r\nPretender; that they were making an unsecure and dishonourable peace;\r\nthat the weight of the nation was against them; and that it was\r\nimpossible for them to preserve much longer their credit or power.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: One of the Elector's privy councillors. See note, vol. v.,\r\np. 468. \"As little a fellow as Robethon is,\" wrote Bolingbroke to Thomas\r\nHarley, \"I have reason to believe that most of the ill impressions which\r\nhave been given at that court have chiefly come from him; and as I know\r\nhim to be mercenary, I doubt not but he has found his account in this\r\nhis management.\" (Bol., \"Correspondence,\" vol. ii., p. 385). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Earl Rivers had, in the foregoing year, been sent to Hanover, in\r\norder to undeceive the Elector, and remove whatever prejudices might be\r\ninfused into his Highness against Her Majesty's proceedings; but it\r\nshould seem that he had no very great success in his negotiation: for\r\nsoon after his return to England, Mons. Bothmar's \"Memorial\" appeared in\r\nthe manner I have already related, which discovered the sentiments of\r\nhis electoral Highness (if they were truly represented in that\r\n\"Memorial\") to differ not a little from those of the Queen. Mr. Harley\r\nwas therefore directed to take the first opportunity of speaking to the\r\nElector in private, to assure him, \"That although Her Majesty had\r\nthought herself justly provoked by the conduct of his minister, yet such\r\nwas her affection for his Highness, and concern for the interests of his\r\nfamily, that instead of showing the least mark of resentment, she had\r\nchosen to send him (Mr. Harley) fully instructed to open her designs,\r\nand shew his Highness the real interest of Britain in the present\r\nconjuncture.\" Mr. Harley was to give the Elector a true account of what\r\nhad passed in England, during the first part of this session of\r\nParliament; to expose to his Highness the weakness of those with whom\r\nhis minister had consulted, and under whose directions he had acted; to\r\nconvince him how much lower that faction must become, when a peace\r\nshould be concluded, and when the natural strength of the kingdom,\r\ndisencumbered from the burthen of the war, should be at liberty to exert\r\nitself; to shew him how his interest in the succession was sacrificed to\r\nthat of a party: that his Highness had been hitherto a friend to both\r\nsides, but that the measures taken by his ministers, had tended only to\r\nset him at the head of one in opposition to the other: to explain to the\r\nElector, how fully the safety of Europe was provided for by the plan of\r\npeace in Her Majesty's speech; and how little reason those would appear\r\nto have, who complained the loudest of this plan, if it were compared\r\neither with our engagements to them when we began the war, or with their\r\nperformances in the course of it.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion Mr, Harley was to observe to the Elector, \"That it\r\nshould rather be wondered at, how the Queen had brought France to offer\r\nso much, than yet to offer no more; because, as soon as ever it\r\nappeared, that Her Majesty would be at the head of this treaty, and that\r\nthe interests of Britain were to be provided for, such endeavours were\r\nused to break off the negotiation, as are hardly to be paralleled; and\r\nthe disunion thereby created among the allies, had given more\r\nopportunities to the enemy, of being slow in their concessions, than any\r\nother measures might possibly have done: That this want of concert among\r\nthe allies, could not in any sort be imputed to the Queen, who had all\r\nalong invited them to it with the greatest earnestness, as the surest\r\nmeans to bring France to reason: That she had always, in a particular\r\nmanner, pressed the States General to come into the strictest union with\r\nher, and opened to them her intentions with the greatest freedom; but\r\nfinding, that instead of concurring with Her Majesty, they were daily\r\ncarrying on intrigues to break off the negotiation, and thereby deprive\r\nher of the advantages she might justly expect from the ensuing peace,\r\nhaving no other way left, she was forced to act with France as she did,\r\nby herself: That, however, the Queen had not taken upon herself to\r\ndetermine the interests of the allies, who were at liberty of insisting\r\non farther pretensions, wherein Her Majesty would not be wanting to\r\nsupport them as far as she was able, and improve the concessions already\r\nmade by France; in which case, a good understanding and harmony among\r\nthe confederates, would yet be of the greatest use for making the enemy\r\nmore tractable and easy.\"\r\n\r\nI have been more particular in reciting the substance of Mr. Harley's\r\ninstructions, because it will serve as a recapitulation of what I have\r\nalready said upon this subject, and seems to set Her Majesty's\r\nintentions, and proceedings at this time, in the clearest light.\r\n\r\nAfter the cessation of arms declared by the Duke of Ormonde, upon the\r\ndelivery of Dunkirk, the British plenipotentiaries very earnestly\r\npressed those of Holland to come into a general armistice; for if the\r\nwhole confederacy acted in conjunction, this would certainly be the best\r\nmeans for bringing the common enemy to reasonable terms of peace: but\r\nthe States, deluded by the boundless promises of Count Zinzendorf, and\r\nthe undertaking talent of Prince Eugene, who dreaded the conclusion of\r\nthe war, as the period of his glory, would not hear of a cessation. The\r\nloss of eighteen thousand Britons was not a diminution of weight in the\r\nbalance of such an ally as the Emperor, and such a general as the\r\nPrince. Besides, they looked upon themselves to be still superior to\r\nFrance in the field; and although their computation was certainly right\r\nin point of number, yet, in my opinion, the conclusion drawn from it,\r\nwas grounded upon a great mistake. I have been assured by several\r\npersons of our own country, and some foreigners of the first rank, both\r\nfor skill and station in arms, that in most victories obtained in the\r\npresent war, the British troops were ever employed in the post of danger\r\nand honour, and usually began the attack (being allowed to be naturally\r\nmore fearless than the people of any other country), by which they were\r\nnot only an example of courage to the rest, but must be acknowledged,\r\nwithout partiality, to have governed the fortune of the day; since it is\r\nknown enough, how small a part of an army is generally engaged in any\r\nbattle. It may likewise be added, that nothing is of greater moment in\r\nwar than opinion. The French, by their frequent losses, which they\r\nchiefly attributed to the courage of our men, believed that a British\r\ngeneral, at the head of British troops, was not to be overcome; and the\r\nMaréchal de Villars was quickly sensible of the advantage he had got;\r\nfor, in a very few days after the desertion of the allies, happened the\r\nEarl of Albemarle's disgrace at Denain, by a feint of the Maréchal's,\r\nand a manifest failure somewhere or other, both of courage and conduct\r\non the side of the confederates. The blame of which was equally shared\r\nbetween Prince Eugene and the Earl; although it is certain, the Duke of\r\nOrmonde gave the latter timely warning of his danger, observing he was\r\nneither intrenched as he ought, nor provided with bridges sufficient for\r\nthe situation he was in, and at such a distance from the main army.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: It is alleged by the continuator of Rapin, that the\r\nsurprise and defeat of the confederated troops under the Earl of\r\nAlbemarle, at Denain, was, in a great measure, owing to the Duke of\r\nOrmonde having, in spite of all remonstrance, reclaimed and carried off\r\ncertain pontoons which had been lent to the allies. For Prince Eugene\r\nhaving received intelligence of the design against Albemarle, marched to\r\nhis succour; but the bridge having broken under the quantity of the\r\nbaggage which had been transported across the Scheldt, he could only\r\nremain the spectator of their misfortune. [S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Torcy had likewise the same sentiments, of what mighty\r\nconsequence those few British battalions were to the confederate army;\r\nsince he advised his master to deliver up Dunkirk, although the Queen\r\ncould not perform the condition understood, which was a cessation of\r\narms of all the foreign forces in her pay.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned, that Mons. de Torcy made great merit of this\r\nconfidence that his master placed in the Queen; and observing Her\r\nMajesty's displeasure against the Dutch, on account of their late\r\nproceedings, endeavoured to inflame it with aggravations enough;\r\ninsinuating, \"That, since the States had acted so ungratefully, the\r\nQueen should let her forces join with those of France, in order to\r\ncompel the confederates to a peace.\" But although this overture were\r\nvery tenderly hinted from the French court, Her Majesty heard it with\r\nthe utmost abhorrence; and ordered her secretary, Mr. St. John (created\r\nabout this time Viscount Bolingbroke),[17] to tell Mons. de Torcy, \"That\r\nno provocations whatever should tempt her to distress her allies; but\r\nshe would endeavour to bring them to reason by fair means, or leave them\r\nto their own conduct: That if the former should be found impracticable,\r\nshe would then make her own peace, and content herself with doing the\r\noffice of a mediator between both parties: but if the States should at\r\nany time come to a better mind, and suffer their ministers to act in\r\nconjunction with hers, she would assert their just interests to the\r\nutmost, and make no farther progress in any treaty with France, until\r\nthose allies received all reasonable satisfaction, both as to their\r\nbarrier and their trade.\" The British plenipotentiaries were directed to\r\ngive the same assurances to the Dutch ministers at Utrecht, and withal\r\nto let them know, \"That the Queen was determined, by their late conduct,\r\nto make peace either with or without them; but would much rather choose\r\nthe former.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Bolingbroke had understood that he would not lose rank on\r\nhis promotion, from which he concluded that the earldom of Bolingbroke,\r\nextinct in his family, would be revived in his favour. His indignation,\r\nhowever, was very keen when he was created only a Viscount. He wrote to\r\nStrafford at Utrecht, that his promotion had been a mortification to\r\nhim. \"In the House of Commons,\" he said, \"I may say that I was at the\r\nhead of business. ... There was, therefore, nothing to flatter my\r\nambition in removing me from thence, but giving me the title which had\r\nbeen many years in my family, and which reverted to the Crown about a\r\nyear ago, by the death of the last of the elder house. ... I own to you\r\nthat I felt more indignation than ever in my life I had done.\" (Letter\r\nto the Earl of Strafford, July 23, 1712). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one advantage which Her Majesty resolved to make by\r\nthis defection of her foreigners. She had been led, by the mistaken\r\npolitics of some years past, to involve herself in several guaranties\r\nwith the princes of the north, which were, in some sort, contradictory\r\nto one another; but this conduct of theirs wholly annulled all such\r\nengagements, and left her at liberty to interpose in the affairs of\r\nthose parts of Europe, in such a manner as would best serve the\r\ninterests of her own kingdoms, as well as that of the Protestant\r\nreligion, and settle a due balance of power in the north.\r\n\r\nThe grand article for preventing the union of France and Spain, was to\r\nbe executed during a cessation of arms. But many difficulties arising\r\nabout that, and some other points of great importance to the common\r\ncause, which could not easily be adjusted either between the French and\r\nBritish plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, or by correspondence between Mons.\r\nde Torcy and the ministry here; the Queen took the resolution of sending\r\nthe Lord Viscount Bolingbroke immediately to France, fully instructed in\r\nall her intentions, and authorized to negotiate every thing necessary\r\nfor settling the treaty of peace in such a course, as might bring it to\r\na happy and speedy conclusion. He was empowered to agree to a general\r\nsuspension of arms, by sea and land, between Great Britain, France and\r\nSpain, to continue for four months, or until the conclusion of the\r\npeace; provided France and Spain would previously give positive\r\nassurances to make good the terms demanded by Her Majesty for the Duke\r\nof Savoy, and would likewise adjust and determine the forms of the\r\nseveral renunciations to be made by both those crowns, in order to\r\nprevent their being ever united. The Lord Bolingbroke was likewise\r\nauthorized to settle some differences relating to the Elector of\r\nBavaria, for whose interests France was as much concerned as Her Majesty\r\nwas for those of the Duke of Savoy; to explain all doubtful articles\r\nwhich particularly related to the advantages of Britain; to know the\r\nreal _ultimatum_, as it is termed, of France upon the general plan of\r\npeace; and lastly, to cut off all hopes from that court of ever bringing\r\nthe Queen to force her allies to a disadvantageous peace; Her Majesty\r\nresolving to impose no scheme at all upon them, or to debar them from\r\nthe liberty of endeavouring to obtain the best conditions they could.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Bolingbroke went to France in the beginning of August,[18] was\r\nreceived at court with particular marks of distinction and respect; and\r\nin a very few days, by his usual address and ability, performed every\r\npart of his commission, extremely to the Queen's content and his own\r\nhonour. He returned to England before the end of the month; but Mr.\r\nPrior, who went along with him, was left behind, to adjust whatever\r\ndifferences might remain or arise between the two crowns.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"Lord Bolingbroke and Prior set out for France last\r\nSaturday. My lord's business is to hasten the peace before the Dutch are\r\ntoo much mauled, and hinder France from carrying the jest of beating\r\nthem too far.\" (\"Journal to Stella,\" August 7th, 1712. See vol. ii., p.\r\n381 of present edition). The result of Bolingbroke's visit was the\r\nsigning, on August 19th, of an agreement for the suspension of arms for\r\nfour months. Torcy's reception of Bolingbroke was so managed that the\r\n_bon vivant_ peer had as pleasant a time as he could well have wished.\r\nHow much influence that had on Bolingbroke we can only speculate; but it\r\nis certain that he would have made a separate peace with France, after\r\nhis return, had Oxford been willing. See Torcy's \"Mémoires\" (vol. ii.,\r\np. 202). \"Bolingbroke avoit conseillé à la Reine sa maîtresse de\r\npréférer une paix particulière à la suspension d'armes, et d'assurer au\r\nplus tôt à ses sujets la jouissance de toutes les conditions dont le Roi\r\nétoit convenu en faveur de l'Angleterre.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: There is a long letter from Lord Bolingbroke to Mr. Prior,\r\non the subject of this negotiation, printed in Scott's edition of Swift,\r\nvol. xv., pp. 524-529. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the general conferences at Utrecht, which for several\r\nweeks had been let fall, since the delivery of Dunkirk, were now\r\nresumed. But the Dutch still declaring against a suspension of arms, and\r\nrefusing to accept the Queen's speech as a plan to negotiate upon, there\r\nwas no progress made for some time in the great work of the peace.\r\nWhereupon the British plenipotentiaries told those of the States, \"That\r\nif the Queen's endeavours could not procure more than the contents of\r\nher speech, or if the French should ever fall short of what was there\r\noffered, the Dutch could blame none but themselves, who, by their\r\nconduct, had rendered things difficult, that would otherwise have been\r\neasy.\" However, Her Majesty thought it prudent to keep the States still\r\nin hopes of her good offices, to prevent them from taking the desperate\r\ncourse of leaving themselves wholly at the mercy of France; which was an\r\nexpedient they formerly practised, and which a party among them was now\r\ninclined to advise.\r\n\r\nWhilst the congress at Utrecht remained in this inactive state, the\r\nQueen proceeded to perfect that important article for preventing the\r\nunion of France and Spain. It was proposed and accepted, that Philip\r\nshould renounce France, for himself and his posterity; and that the Most\r\nChristian King, and all the princes of his blood, should, in the like\r\nmanner, renounce Spain.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, that this project of renunciation lay under a\r\ngreat disrepute, by the former practices of this very King, Lewis XIV.\r\npursuant to an absurd notion among many in that kingdom, of a divine\r\nright, annexed to proximity of blood, not to be controlled by any human\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nBut it is plain, the French themselves had recourse to this method,\r\nafter all their infractions of it, since the Pyrenean treaty; for the\r\nfirst dauphin, in whom the original claim was vested, renounced, for\r\nhimself and his eldest son, which opened the way to Philip Duke of\r\nAnjou; who would however hardly have succeeded, if it had not been for\r\nthe will made in his favour by the last King, Charles II.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed hard to reflect, with any patience, upon the unaccountable\r\nstupidity of the princes of Europe for some centuries past, who left a\r\nprobability to France of succeeding in a few ages to all their\r\ndominions; whilst, at the same time, no alliance with that kingdom could\r\nbe of advantage to any prince, by reason of the salique law. Should not\r\ncommon prudence have taught every sovereign in Christendom to enact a\r\nsalique law, with respect to France; for want of which, it is almost a\r\nmiracle, that the Bourbon family hath not possessed the universal\r\nmonarchy by right of inheritance? When the French assert a proximity of\r\nblood gives a divine right, as some of their ministers, who ought to be\r\nmore wise or honest, have lately advanced in this very case, to the\r\ntitle of Spain; do they not, by allowing a French succession, make their\r\nown kings usurpers? Or, if the salique law be divine, is it not of\r\nuniversal obligation, and consequently of force, to exclude France from\r\ninheriting by daughters? Or, lastly, if that law be of human\r\ninstitution, may it not be enacted in any state, with whatever extent or\r\nlimitation the legislature shall think fit? For the notion of an\r\nunchangeable human law is an absurdity in government, to be believed\r\nonly by ignorance, and supported by power. From hence it follows, that\r\nthe children of the late Queen of France, although she had renounced,\r\nwere as legally excluded from succeeding to Spain, as if the salique law\r\nhad been fundamental in that kingdom; since that exclusion was\r\nestablished by every power in Spain, which could possibly give a\r\nsanction to any law there; and therefore the Duke of Anjou's title is\r\nwholly founded upon the bequest of his predecessor (which hath great\r\nauthority in that monarchy, as it formerly had in ours), upon the\r\nconfirmation of the Cortes, and the general consent of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, the faith of princes is so frequently subservient to\r\ntheir ambition, that renunciations have little validity, otherwise than\r\nfrom the powers and parties whose interest it is to support them. But\r\nthis renunciation, which the Queen hath exacted from the French King and\r\nhis grandson, I take to be armed with all the essential circumstances\r\nthat can fortify such an act. For as it is necessary, for the security\r\nof every prince in Europe, that those two great kingdoms should never be\r\nunited; so the chief among them will readily consent to be guarantees\r\nfor preventing such a misfortune.\r\n\r\nBesides, this proposal (according to Her Majesty's expression in her\r\nspeech) is of such a nature, that it executes itself; because the\r\nSpaniards, who dread such an union, for every reason that can have\r\nweight among men, took care that their king should not only renounce, in\r\nthe most solemn manner; but likewise, that the act should be framed in\r\nthe strongest terms themselves could invent, or we could furnish them\r\nwith. As to France, upon supposal of the young dauphin's dying in a few\r\nyears, that kingdom will not be in a condition to engage in a long war\r\nagainst a powerful alliance, fortified with the addition of the\r\nSpaniards, and the party of the Duke of Berry, or whoever else shall be\r\nnext claimer: and the longer the present dauphin lives, the weaker must\r\nPhilip's interest be in France; because the princes, who are to succeed\r\nby this renunciation, will have most power and credit in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe mischiefs occasioned by the want of a good understanding between the\r\nallies, especially Britain and Holland, were raised every day; the\r\nFrench taking the advantage, and raising difficulties, not only upon the\r\ngeneral plan of peace, but likewise upon the explanation of several\r\narticles in the projected treaty between them and Her Majesty: They\r\ninsisted to have Lille, as the equivalent for Dunkirk; and demanded\r\nTournay, Maubeuge, and Condé, for the two or three towns mentioned in\r\nthe Queen's speech; which the British plenipotentiaries were so far from\r\nallowing, that they refused to confer with those of France upon that\r\nfoot; although, at the same time, the former had fresh apprehensions\r\nthat the Dutch, in a fit of despair, would accept whatever terms the\r\nenemy pleased to offer, and, by precipitating their own peace, prevent\r\nHer Majesty from obtaining any advantages, both for her allies and\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nIt is most certain, that the repeated losses suffered by the States, in\r\nlittle more than two months after they had withdrawn themselves from the\r\nQueen's assistance, did wholly disconcert their counsels;[20] and their\r\nprudence (as it is usual) began to forsake them with their good fortune.\r\nThey were so weak as to be still deluded by their friends in England,\r\nwho continued to give them hopes of some mighty and immediate resource\r\nfrom hence; for when the Duke of Ormonde had been about a month in\r\nGhent, he received a letter from the Maréchal de Villars, to inform him,\r\nthat the Dutch generals, taken at Denain, had told the maréchal\r\npublicly, of a sudden revolution expected in Britain; that particularly\r\nthe Earl of Albemarle and Mons. Hompesch discoursed very freely of it,\r\nand that nothing was more commonly talked of in Holland. It was then\r\nlikewise confidently reported in Ghent, that the Queen was dead; and we\r\nall remember what rumour flew about here at the very same time, as if\r\nHer Majesty's health were in a bad condition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The Dutch had been defeated at Douay, and the Allies had\r\nsuffered reverses by the reduction of Quesnoy and Bouchain. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nWhether such vain hopes as these gave spirit to the Dutch; whether their\r\nfrequent misfortunes made them angry and sullen; whether they still\r\nexpected to overreach us by some private stipulations with France,\r\nthrough the mediation of the Elector of Bavaria, as that prince\r\nafterwards gave out; or whatever else was the cause, they utterly\r\nrefused a cessation of arms; and made not the least return to all the\r\nadvances and invitations made by Her Majesty, until the close of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nIt was then the States first began to view their affairs in another\r\nlight; to consider how little the vast promises of Count Zinzendorf were\r\nto be relied on; to be convinced that France was not disposed to break\r\nwith Her Majesty, only to gratify their ill humour, or unreasonable\r\ndemands; to discover that their factious correspondents on this side the\r\nwater had shamefully misled them; that some of their own principal towns\r\ngrew heartily weary of the war, and backward in their loans; and,\r\nlastly, that Prince Eugene, their new general, whether his genius or\r\nfortune had left him, was not for their turn. They, therefore, directed\r\ntheir ministers at Utrecht to signify to the lord privy seal and the\r\nEarl of Strafford, \"That the States were disposed to comply with Her\r\nMajesty, and to desire her good offices with France; particularly, that\r\nTournay and Condé might be left to them as part of their barrier,\r\nwithout which they could not be safe: That the Elector of Bavaria might\r\nnot be suffered to retain any town in the Netherlands, which would be as\r\nbad for Holland as if those places were in the hands of France:\r\nTherefore the States proposed, that Luxembourg, Namur, Charleroy, and\r\nNieuport, might be delivered to the Emperor. Lastly, That the French\r\nmight not insist on excepting the four species of goods out of the\r\ntariff of one thousand six hundred and sixty-four: That if Her Majesty\r\ncould prevail with France to satisfy their masters on these articles,\r\nthey would be ready to submit in all the rest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen received an account of this good disposition in the\r\nStates General, immediately orders were sent to Mr. Prior, to inform the\r\nministers of the French court, \"That Her Majesty had now some hopes of\r\nthe Dutch complying with her measures; and therefore she resolved, as\r\nshe had always declared, whenever those allies came to themselves, not\r\nto make the peace without their reasonable satisfaction.\" The difficulty\r\nthat most pressed, was about the disposal of Tournay and Condé. The\r\nDutch insisted strongly to have both, and the French were extremely\r\nunwilling to part with either.\r\n\r\nThe Queen judged the former would suffice, for completing the barrier of\r\nthe States. Mr. Prior was therefore directed to press the Marquis de\r\nTorcy effectually on this head, and to terminate all that minister's\r\nobjections, by assuring him of Her Majesty's resolutions to appear\r\nopenly on the side of the Dutch, if this demand were refused. It was\r\nthought convenient to act in this resolute manner with France, whose\r\nlate success, against Holland, had taught the ministers of the Most\r\nChristian King to resume their old imperious manner of treating with\r\nthat republic; to which they were farther encouraged by the ill\r\nunderstanding between Her Majesty and the allies.\r\n\r\nThis appeared from the result of an idle quarrel that happened, about\r\nthe end of August,[21] at Utrecht, between a French and a Dutch\r\nplenipotentiary, Mons. Mesnager and Count Rechteren;[22] wherein the\r\ncourt of France demanded such abject submissions, and with so much\r\nhaughtiness, as plainly shewed they were pleased with any occasion of\r\nmortifying the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: July. [S]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: See note on p. 95. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBesides, the politics of the French ran at this time very opposite to\r\nthose of Britain: They thought the ministers here durst not meet the\r\nParliament without a peace; and that, therefore, Her Majesty would\r\neither force the States to comply with France, by delivering up Tournay,\r\nwhich was the principal point in dispute, or would finish her own peace\r\nwith France and Spain, leaving a fixed time for Holland to refuse or\r\naccept the terms imposed on them. But the Queen, who thought the demand\r\nof Tournay by the States to be very necessary and just, was determined\r\nto insist upon it, and to declare openly against France, rather than\r\nsuffer her ally to want a place so useful for their barrier. And Mr.\r\nPrior was ordered to signify this resolution of Her Majesty to Mons. de\r\nTorcy, in case that minister could not be otherwise prevailed on.\r\n\r\nThe British plenipotentiaries did likewise, at the same time, express to\r\nthose of Holland Her Majesty's great satisfaction, that the States were\r\nat last disposed to act in confidence with her: \"That she wished this\r\nresolution had been sooner taken, since nobody had gained by the delay,\r\nbut the French King; that, however, Her Majesty did not question the\r\nprocuring a safe and honourable peace, by united counsels, reasonable\r\ndemands, and prudent measures; that she would assist them in getting\r\nwhatever was necessary to their barrier, and in settling, to their\r\nsatisfaction, the exceptions made by France out of the tariff of one\r\nthousand six hundred and sixty-four; that no other difficulties remained\r\nof moment to retard the peace, since the Queen had obtained Sicily for\r\nthe Duke of Savoy; and, in the settlement of the Low Countries, would\r\nadhere to what she delivered from the throne: That as to the empire, Her\r\nMajesty heartily wished their barrier as good as could be desired; but\r\nthat we were not now in circumstances to expect every thing exactly\r\naccording to the scheme of Holland: France had already offered a great\r\npart, and the Queen did not think the remainder worth the continuance of\r\nthe war.\"\r\n\r\nHer Majesty conceived the peace in so much forwardness, that she thought\r\nfit, about this time, to nominate the Duke of Hamilton and the Lord\r\nLexington for ambassadors in France and Spain, to receive the\r\nrenunciations in both courts, and adjust matters of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe duke[23] was preparing for his journey, when he was challenged to a\r\nduel[24] by the Lord Mohun,[25] a person of infamous character. He\r\nkilled his adversary upon the spot, though he himself received a wound;\r\nand, weakened by the loss of blood, as he was leaning in the arms of his\r\nsecond, was most barbarously stabbed in the breast by Lieutenant-General\r\nMacartney,[26] who was second to Lord Mohun. He died a few minutes after\r\nin the field, and the murderer made his escape. I thought so surprising\r\nan event might deserve barely to be related, although it be something\r\nforeign to my subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: James, Duke of Hamilton, was a gentleman of the\r\nbed-chamber to King Charles II. He succeeded his father in the title,\r\nApril 18th, 1694, and was sent the same year envoy extraordinary to\r\nFrance; ... he was killed, November 15th, 1712. [S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Swift's account of the duel is exactly agreeable to the\r\ndepositions of Colonel Hamilton before a committee of the council. [S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Charles Lord Mohun was the last offspring of a very noble\r\nand ancient family, of which William de Mohun, who accompanied the\r\nNorman conqueror, was the first founder in England. [S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: General Macartney was tried, at the King's Bench bar, for\r\nthe murder, June 13th, 1716; and the jury found him guilty of\r\nman-slaughter. [S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Strafford, who had come to England in May last,[27] in order\r\nto give Her Majesty an account of the disposition of affairs in Holland,\r\nwas now returning with her last instructions, to let the Dutch minister\r\nknow, \"That some points would probably meet with difficulties not to be\r\novercome, which once might have been easily obtained: To shew what evil\r\nconsequences had already flowed from their delay and irresolution, and\r\nto entreat them to fix on some proposition, reasonable in itself, as\r\nwell as possible to be effected: That the Queen would insist upon the\r\ncession of Tournay by France, provided the States would concur in\r\nfinishing the peace, without starting new objections, or insisting upon\r\nfarther points: That the French demands, in favour of the Elector of\r\nBavaria, appeared to be such as, the Queen was of opinion, the States\r\nought to agree to; which were, to leave the Elector in possession of\r\nLuxembourg, Namur, and Charleroy, subject to the terms of their barrier,\r\nuntil he should be restored to his electorate; and to give him the\r\nkingdom of Sardinia, to efface the stain of his degradation in the\r\nelectoral college: That the earl had brought over a project of a new\r\nTreaty of Succession and Barrier, which Her Majesty insisted the States\r\nshould sign, before the conclusion of the peace; the former treaty\r\nhaving been disadvantageous to her subjects, containing in it the seeds\r\nof future dissensions, and condemned by the sense of the nation. Lastly,\r\nThat Her Majesty, notwithstanding all provocations, had, for the sake of\r\nthe Dutch, and in hopes of their recovery from those false notions which\r\nhad so long misled them, hitherto kept the negotiations open: That the\r\noffers now made them were her last, and this the last time she would\r\napply to them: That they must either agree, or expect the Queen would\r\nproceed immediately to conclude her treaty with France and Spain, in\r\nconjunction with such of her allies as would think fit to adhere to her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: \"Come to England in ... last\" in original edition. The\r\nword \"May\" was supplied in the edition of 1775. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\n\"As to Savoy, that the Queen expected the States would concur with her\r\nin making good the advantages stipulated for that duke, and in\r\nprevailing with the Emperor to consent to an absolute neutrality in\r\nItaly, until the peace should be concluded.\"\r\n\r\nThe governing party in Holland, however in appearance disposed to\r\nfinish, affected new delays, and raised many difficulties about the four\r\nspecies of goods, which the French had excepted out of the tariff. Count\r\nZinzendorf, the Emperor's plenipotentiary, did all that was possible to\r\nkeep up this humour in the Dutch, in hopes to put them under a necessity\r\nof preparing for the next campaign; and some time after went so far in\r\nthis pursuit, that he summoned the several ministers of the empire, and\r\ntold them he had letters from his master, with orders to signify to\r\nthem, \"That his Imperial Majesty resolved to begin the campaign early,\r\nwith all his forces united against France; of which he desired they\r\nwould send notice to all their courts, that the several princes might be\r\nready to furnish their contingents and recruits.\" At the same time\r\nZinzendorf endeavoured to borrow two millions of florins upon the\r\nsecurity of some imperial cities; but could not succeed either amongst\r\nthe Jews or at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Strafford arrived at Utrecht, the lord privy seal and\r\nhe communicated to the Dutch ministers the new Treaty for a Succession\r\nand Barrier, as the Queen had ordered it to be prepared here in England,\r\ndiffering from the former in several points of the greatest moment,\r\nobvious to any who will be at the pains to compare them. This was\r\nstrenuously opposed for several weeks by the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nStates; but the province of Utrecht, where the congress was held,\r\nimmediately sent orders to their representatives at The Hague, to\r\ndeclare their province thankful to the Queen; that they agreed the peace\r\nshould be made on the terms proposed by France, and consented to the new\r\nprojected Treaty of Barrier and Succession: and about the close of the\r\nyear, one thousand seven hundred and twelve, four of the seven\r\nprovinces, had delivered their opinions for putting an end to the war.\r\n\r\nThis unusual precipitation in the States, so different from the whole\r\ntenor of their former conduct, was very much suspected by the British\r\nplenipotentiaries. Their Lordships had received intelligence, that the\r\nDutch ministers held frequent conferences with those of France, and had\r\noffered to settle their interests with that crown, without the\r\nconcurrence of Britain. Count Zinzendorf, and his colleagues, appeared\r\nlikewise, all on the sudden, to have the same dispositions, and to be in\r\ngreat haste to settle their several differences with the States. The\r\nreasons for this proceeding were visible enough; many difficulties were\r\nyet undetermined in the treaty of commerce between Her Majesty and\r\nFrance, for the adjusting of which, and some other points, the Queen had\r\nlately dispatched the Duke of Shrewsbury to that court. Some of these\r\nwere of hard digestion, with which the Most Christian King would not be\r\nunder a necessity of complying, when he had no farther occasion for us,\r\nand might, upon that account, afford better terms to the other two\r\npowers. Besides, the Emperor and the States could very well spare Her\r\nMajesty the honour of being arbitrator of a general peace; and the\r\nlatter hoped by this means, to avoid the new Treaty of Barrier and\r\nSuccession, which we were now forcing on them.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the consequences of this evil, there fortunately fell out an\r\nincident, which the two lords at Utrecht knew well how to make use of:\r\nthe quarrel between Mons. Mesnager and Count Rechteren (formerly\r\nmentioned) had not yet been made up. The French and Dutch differing in\r\nsome circumstances, about the satisfaction to be given by the count for\r\nthe affront he had offered, the British plenipotentiaries kept this\r\ndispute on foot for several days; and, in the mean time, pressed the\r\nDutch to finish the new Treaty of Barrier and Succession between Her\r\nMajesty and them, which, about the middle of January, was concluded\r\nfully to the Queen's satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut while these debates and differences continued at the congress, the\r\nQueen resolved to put a speedy end to her part in the war; she therefore\r\nsent orders to the lord privy seal, and the Earl of Stafford, to prepare\r\nevery thing necessary for signing her own treaty with France. This she\r\nhoped might be done against the meeting of her Parliament, now prorogued\r\nto the third of February; in which time, those among the allies, who\r\nwere really inclined towards a peace, might settle their several\r\ninterests by the assistance and support of Her Majesty's\r\nplenipotentiaries; and as for the rest, who would either refuse to\r\ncomply, or endeavour to protract the negotiation, the heads of their\r\nrespective demands, which France had yielded by Her Majesty's\r\nintervention, and agreeable to the plan laid down in her speech, should\r\nbe mentioned in the treaty, and a time limited for the several powers\r\nconcerned to receive or reject them.\r\n\r\nThe Pretender was not yet gone out of France, upon some difficulties\r\nalleged by the French, about procuring him a safe conduct to Bar-le-duc,\r\nin the Duke of Lorraine's dominions, where it was then proposed he\r\nshould reside. The Queen, altogether bent upon quieting the minds of her\r\nsubjects, declared, she would not sign the peace till that person were\r\nremoved; although several wise men believed he could be no where less\r\ndangerous to Britain, than in the place where he was.\r\n\r\nThe argument which most prevailed on the States to sign the new Treaty\r\nof Barrier and Succession with Britain, was Her Majesty's promise to\r\nprocure Tournay for them from France; after which, no more differences\r\nremained between us and that republic, and consequently they had no\r\nfarther temptations to any separate transactions with the French, who\r\nthereupon began to renew their litigious and haughty manner of treating\r\nwith the Dutch. The satisfaction they extorted for the affront given by\r\nCount Rechteren to Mons. Mesnager, although somewhat softened by the\r\nBritish ministers at Utrecht, was yet so rigorous, that Her Majesty\r\ncould not forbear signifying her resentment of it to the Most Christian\r\nKing. Mons. Mesnager, who seemed to have more the genius of a merchant\r\nthan a minister, began, in his conferences with the plenipotentiaries of\r\nthe States, to raise new disputes upon points which both we and they had\r\nreckoned upon as wholly settled. The Abbé de Polignac, a most\r\naccomplished person, of great generosity and universal understanding,\r\nwas gone to France to receive the cardinal's cap; and the Maréchal\r\nd'Uxelles was wholly guided by his colleague, Mons. Mesnager, who kept\r\nup those brangles, that for a time obstructed the peace; some of which\r\nwere against all justice, and others of small importance, both of very\r\nlittle advantage to his country, and less to the reputation of his\r\nmaster or himself. This low talent in business, which the Cardinal de\r\nPolignac used, in contempt, to call a \"spirit of negotiating,\" made it\r\nimpossible for the two lords plenipotentiaries, with all their abilities\r\nand experience, to bring Mesnager to reason, in several points both with\r\nus and the States: his concessions were few and constrained, serving\r\nonly to render him more tenacious of what he refused. In several of the\r\ntowns, which the States were to keep, he insisted that France should\r\nretain the chatellanies, or extent of country depending on them,\r\nparticularly that of Tournay; a demand the more unjustifiable, because\r\nhe knew his master had not only proceeded directly contrary, but had\r\nerected a court in his kingdom, where his own judges extended the\r\nterritories about those towns he had taken, as far as he pleased to\r\ndirect them. Mons. Mesnager showed equal obstinacy in what his master\r\nexpected for the Elector of Bavaria, and in refusing the tariff of one\r\nthousand six hundred and sixty-four: so that the Queen's\r\nplenipotentiaries represented these difficulties as what might be of\r\ndangerous consequence, both to the peace in general, and to the States\r\nin particular, if they were not speedily prevented.\r\n\r\nUpon these considerations Her Majesty thought it her shortest and safest\r\ncourse to apply directly to France, where she had then so able a\r\nminister as the Duke of Shrewsbury.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Shrewsbury had been appointed the Duke of Hamilton's\r\nsuccessor. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Torcy, secretary to the Most Christian King, was the\r\nminister with whom the Duke was to treat, as having been the first who\r\nmoved his master to apply to the Queen for a peace, in opposition to a\r\nviolent faction in that kingdom, who were as eagerly bent to continue\r\nthe war, as any other could be either here or in Holland.\r\n\r\nIt would be very unlike a historian, to refuse this great minister the\r\npraise he so justly deserveth, of having treated, through the whole\r\ncourse of so great a negotiation, with the utmost candour and integrity;\r\nnever once failing in any promise he made, and tempering a firm zeal to\r\nhis master's interest, with a ready compliance to what was reasonable\r\nand just. Mr. Prior, whom I have formerly mentioned, resided likewise\r\nnow at Paris, with the character of minister plenipotentiary, and was\r\nvery acceptable to that court, upon the score of his wit and humour.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: P. Fitzgerald adds, \"as well as useful to Her Majesty by\r\nhis knowledge and dexterity in the management of affairs.\" [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Shrewsbury was directed to press the French court upon the\r\npoints yet unsettled in the treaty of commerce between both crowns; to\r\nmake them drop their unreasonable demands for the Elector of Bavaria; to\r\nlet them know, that the Queen was resolved not to forsake her allies who\r\nwere now ready to come in; that she thought the best way of hastening\r\nthe general peace, was to determine her own particular one with France,\r\nuntil which time she could not conveniently suffer her Parliament to\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nThe States were, by this time, so fully convinced of the Queen's\r\nsincerity and affection to their republic, and how much they had been\r\ndeceived by the insinuations of the factious party in England, that they\r\nwrote a very humble letter to Her Majesty, to desire her assistance\r\ntowards settling those points they had in dispute with France, and\r\nprofessing themselves ready to acquiesce in whatever explanation Her\r\nMajesty would please to make of the plan proposed in her speech to the\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nBut the Queen had already prevented their desires; and in the beginning\r\nof February, one thousand seven hundred and twelve-thirteen, directed\r\nthe Duke of Shrewsbury to inform the French court, \"That since she had\r\nprevailed on her allies, the Dutch, to drop the demand of Condé, and the\r\nother of the four species of goods, which the French had excepted out of\r\nthe tariff of one thousand six hundred and sixty-four, she would not\r\nsign without them: That she approved of the Dutch insisting to have the\r\nchatellanies restored, with the towns, and was resolved to stand or fall\r\nwith them, until they were satisfied in this point.\"\r\n\r\nHer Majesty had some apprehensions, that the French created these\r\ndifficulties on purpose to spin out the treaty, until the campaign\r\nshould begin. They thought it absolutely necessary, that our Parliament\r\nshould meet in a few weeks, which could not well be ventured, until the\r\nQueen were able to tell both Houses, that her own peace was signed: That\r\nthis would not only facilitate what remained in difference between\r\nBritain and France, but leave the Dutch entirely at the mercy of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, weary of these refined mistakes in the French politics, and\r\nfully resolved to be trifled with no longer, sent her determinate orders\r\nto the Duke of Shrewsbury, to let France know, \"That Her Majesty had\r\nhitherto prorogued her Parliament, in hopes of accommodating the\r\ndifficulties in her own treaties of peace and commerce with that crown,\r\nas well as settling the interests of her several allies; or, at least,\r\nthat the differences in the former being removed, the Most Christian\r\nKing would have made such offers for the latter, as might justify Her\r\nMajesty in signing her own peace, whether the confederates intended to\r\nsign theirs or no. But several points being yet unfinished between both\r\ncrowns, and others between France and the rest of the allies, especially\r\nthe States, to which the plenipotentiaries of that court at Utrecht had\r\nnot thought fit to give satisfaction; the Queen was now come to a final\r\ndetermination, both with relation to her own kingdoms, and to the whole\r\nalliance: That the campaign approaching, she would not willingly be\r\nsurprised in case the war was to go on: That she had transmitted to the\r\nDuke of Shrewsbury her last resolutions, and never would be prevailed on\r\nto reduce her own demands, or those of her allies, any lower than the\r\nscheme now sent over, as an explanation of the plan laid down in her\r\nspeech: That Her Majesty had sent orders to her plenipotentiaries at\r\nUtrecht, to assume the character of ambassadors, and sign the peace\r\nimmediately with the ministers of the Most Christian King, as soon as\r\nthe Duke of Shrewsbury should have sent them notice that the French had\r\ncomplied: That the Queen had therefore farther prorogued her Parliament\r\nto the third of March, in hopes to assure them, by that time, of her\r\npeace being agreed on; for if the two Houses should meet, while any\r\nuncertainty remained, supplies must be asked as for a war.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Shrewsbury[30] executed this important commission with that\r\nspeed and success, which could only be expected from an able minister.\r\nThe French King immediately yielded to the whole scheme Her Majesty\r\nproposed; whereupon directions were sent to the lord privy seal, and the\r\nEarl of Strafford, to sign a peace between Great Britain and France,\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Swift writes to Abp. King, October 20th, 1713, that the\r\nDuke of Shrewsbury \"is the finest gentleman we have, and of an excellent\r\nunderstanding and capacity for business\" (Scott's edition, xvi. 71). See\r\nalso Swift's remarks in \"The Examiner,\" No. 27 (vol. ix, of this\r\nedition, p. 171), and note in vol. v., p. 377. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nUpon the second day of March, the two British plenipotentiaries met\r\nthose of the allies in the town-house at Utrecht; where the lord privy\r\nseal addressed himself to them in a short speech, \"That the negotiation\r\nhad now continued fourteen months with great slowness, which had proved\r\nvery injurious to the interests of the allies: That the Queen had stayed\r\nthus long, and stopped the finishing of her own peace, rather than leave\r\nher allies in any uncertainty: That she hoped they would now be all\r\nprepared to put an end to this great work; and therefore had commanded\r\nher plenipotentiaries to tell those of the allies, That she found it\r\nnecessary to conclude her own treaty immediately; and it was her\r\nopinion, that the confederates ought to finish theirs at the same time,\r\nto which they were now accordingly invited by Her Majesty's orders.\" And\r\nlastly, his lordship declared, in the Queen's name, \"That whoever could\r\nnot be ready on the day prefixed, should have a convenient time allowed\r\nthem to come in.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the orders sent by the Queen to her plenipotentiaries were very\r\nprecise, yet their lordships did not precipitate the performance of\r\nthem. They were directed to appoint as short a day for the signing as\r\nthey conveniently could; but, however, the particular day was left to\r\ntheir discretion. They hoped to bring over the Dutch, and most of the\r\nother allies, to conclude at the same time with the Queen; which, as it\r\nwould certainly be more popular to their country, so they conceived it\r\nwould be more safe for themselves: besides, upon looking over their\r\ncommission, a scruple sprang in their minds, that they could not sign a\r\nparticular peace with France; their powers, as they apprehended,\r\nauthorizing them only to sign a general one. Their lordships therefore\r\nsent to England to desire new powers,[31] and, in the mean time,\r\nemployed themselves with great industry, between the ministers of France\r\nand those of the several allies, to find some expedient for smoothing\r\nthe way to an agreement among them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: \"Lord Bolingbroke, who says he has not sagacity enough to\r\nfind the objections that the plenipotentiaries had made to their first\r\nfull powers, for their satisfaction, sends them a new commission, and\r\nrepeats to them positive orders to sign and conclude with France....\r\nThese difficulties of the plenipotentiaries made my lord treasurer, who\r\nnever failed to exert himself when he found it absolutely necessary,\r\nthink it high time to interpose his authority;.... and as his lordship\r\nnever yet appeared in vain, all further obstructions at Utrecht were\r\nafter this soon removed.\" (\"Report from the Committee of Secrecy,\" 1715,\r\npp. 103, 104.) [N.]]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Strafford went for a few days to The Hague, to inform the\r\nStates of Her Majesty's express commands to his colleague and himself,\r\nfor signing the peace as soon as possible; and to desire they would be\r\nready at the same time: which the pensionary promised; and that their\r\nplenipotentiaries should be empowered accordingly, to the great\r\ncontentment of Mons. Buys, who was now so much altered, either in\r\nreality, or appearance, that he complained to the Earl of Mons.\r\nHeinsius's slowness; and charged all the delays and mismanagements of a\r\ntwelvemonth past to that minister's account.\r\n\r\nWhile the Earl of Strafford stayed at The Hague, he discovered that an\r\nemissary of the Duke of Marlborough's had been there some days before,\r\nsent by his grace to dissuade the Dutch from signing at the same time\r\nwith the ministers of the Queen, which, in England, would at least have\r\nthe appearance of a separate peace, and oblige their British friends,\r\nwho knew how to turn so short a delay to very good account, as well as\r\ngratify the Emperor; on whom, it was alleged, they ought to rely much\r\nmore than on Her Majesty. One of the States likewise told the Earl,\r\n\"That the same person, employed by the Duke, was then in conference with\r\nthe magistrates of Rotterdam (which town had declared for the\r\ncontinuance of the war), to assure them, if they would hold off a\r\nlittle, they should see an unexpected turn in the British Parliament:\r\nThat the Duke of Marlborough had a list of the discontented members in\r\nboth Houses, who were ready to turn against the court; and, to crown\r\nall, that his grace had certain intelligence of the Queen being in so\r\nill a state of health, as made it impossible for her to live above six\r\nweeks.\" So restless and indefatigable is avarice and ambition, when\r\ninflamed by a desire of revenge.\r\n\r\nBut representations, which had been so often tried, were now offered too\r\nlate. Most of the allies, except the Emperor, were willing to put an end\r\nto the war upon Her Majesty's plan; and the further delay of three weeks\r\nmust be chiefly imputed to that litigious manner of treating, peculiar\r\nto the French; whose plenipotentiaries at Utrecht insisted with\r\nobstinacy upon many points, which at Paris Mons. de Torcy had given up.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor expected to keep all he already possessed in Italy; that\r\nPort Longue,[32] on the Tuscan coast, should be delivered to him by\r\nFrance; and, lastly, that he should not be obliged to renounce Spain.\r\nBut the Queen, as well as France, thought that his Imperial Majesty\r\nought to sit down contented with his partage of Naples and Milan; and to\r\nrestore those territories in Italy, which he had taken from the rightful\r\nproprietors, and by the possession of which he was grown dangerous to\r\nthe Italian princes, by reviving antiquated claims upon them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Portolongone, in the island of Elba, opposite the Tuscan\r\ncoast. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThis Prince had likewise objected to Her Majesty's expedient of\r\nsuffering the Elector of Bavaria to retain Luxembourg, under certain\r\nconditions, by way of security, until his electorate were restored. But\r\nthe Queen, supposing that these affected delays were intended only with\r\na view of continuing the war, resolved to defer the peace no longer on\r\nthe Emperor's account.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of March, one thousand seven hundred and twelve-thirteen,\r\na courier arrived at Utrecht from France, with the plan of a general\r\npeace, as it had been agreed between the Duke of Shrewsbury and Mons. de\r\nTorcy; wherein every particular, relating to the interests and\r\npretensions of the several allies, was brought so near to what each of\r\nthem would accept, that the British plenipotentiaries  hoped the peace\r\nwould be general in ten or twelve days. The Portuguese and Dutch were\r\nalready prepared, and others were daily coming in, by means of their\r\nlordships' good offices, who found Mons. Mesnager and his colleague very\r\nstubborn to the last. Another courier was dispatched to France, upon\r\nsome disputes about inserting the titles of Her Majesty and the Most\r\nChristian King, and to bring a general plan for the interests of those\r\nallies, who should not be ready against the time prefixed. The French\r\nrenunciations were now arrived at Utrecht, and it was agreed, that\r\nthose, as well as that of the King of Spain, should be inserted at\r\nlength in every treaty, by which means the whole confederacy would\r\nbecome guaranties of them.\r\n\r\nThe courier, last sent to France, returned to Utrecht on the\r\ntwenty-seventh of March, with the concessions of that court upon every\r\nnecessary point; so that, all things being ready for putting a period to\r\nthis great and difficult work, the lord privy seal and the Earl of\r\nStrafford gave notice to the ministers of the several allies, \"That\r\ntheir lordships had appointed Tuesday the thirty-first instant, wherein\r\nto sign a treaty of peace, and a treaty of commerce, between the Queen\r\nof Great Britain, their mistress, and the Most Christian King; and hoped\r\nthe said allies would be prepared, at the same time, to follow their\r\nexample.\" Accordingly their lordships employed the three intervening\r\ndays, in smoothing the few difficulties that remained between the French\r\nministers and those of the several confederate powers.\r\n\r\nThe important day being now come, the Lord Bishop of Bristol and the\r\nEarl of Strafford, having assumed the character of ambassadors\r\nextraordinary,[33] gave a memorial in behalf of the French Protestants\r\nto the Maréchal d'Uxelles and his colleague, who were to transmit it to\r\ntheir court; and these delivered to the British ambassadors a\r\ndeclaration in writing, that the Pretender was actually gone out of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: To avoid the parade of ceremony, they had hitherto been\r\nconsidered only as _plenipotentiaries_. [N.]]\r\n\r\nThe conditions of peace to be allowed the Emperor and the empire, as\r\nadjusted between Britain and France, were now likewise delivered to the\r\nCount Zinzendorf. These and some other previous matters of smaller\r\nconsequence being finished, the treaties of peace and commerce between\r\nHer Majesty of Britain and the Most Christian King, were signed at the\r\nlord privy seal's house between two and three of the clock in the\r\nafternoon. The ministers of the Duke of Savoy signed about an hour\r\nafter. Then the assembly adjourned to the Earl of Stafford's, where they\r\nall went to dinner; and about nine at night the peace was signed by the\r\nministers of Portugal, by those of Prussia at eleven, and when it was\r\nnear midnight by the States.\r\n\r\nThus after all the opposition raised by a strong party in France, and by\r\na virulent faction in Britain; after all the artifices of those who\r\npresided at The Hague, and, for their private interest, endeavoured, in\r\nconjunction with their friends in England, to prolong the war; after the\r\nrestless endeavours of the imperial court to render the treaty\r\nineffectual; the firm steady conduct of the Queen, the wisdom and\r\ncourage of her ministry, and the abilities of those whom she employed in\r\nher negotiations abroad, prevailed to have a peace signed in one day by\r\nevery power concerned, except that of the Emperor and the empire; for\r\nhis Imperial Majesty liked his situation too well to think of a peace,\r\nwhile the drudgery and expenses of the war lay upon other shoulders, and\r\nthe advantages were to redound only to himself.\r\n\r\nDuring this whole negotiation, the King of Spain, who was not\r\nacknowledged by any of the confederates, had consequently no minister at\r\nUtrecht; but the differences between Her Majesty and that prince were\r\neasily settled by the Lord Lexington at Madrid, and the Marquis of\r\nMonteleon here: so that upon the Duke d'Ossuna's arrival at the\r\ncongress, some days after the peace, he was ready to conclude a treaty\r\nbetween the Queen and his master. Neither is it probable that the Dutch,\r\nor any other ally, except the Emperor, will encounter any difficulties\r\nof moment, to retard their several treaties with his Catholic Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe treaties of peace and commerce between Britain and France, were\r\nratified here on the seventh of April; on the twenty-eighth the\r\nratifications were exchanged; and on the fifth of May the peace was\r\nproclaimed in the usual manner; but with louder acclamations, and more\r\nextraordinary rejoicings of the people, than had ever been remembered on\r\nthe like occasion.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 34  The treaty was brought to England by George St. John,\r\nBolingbroke's young brother, who arrived with it in London on Good\r\nFriday, 3rd April, 1713. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[It need hardly be observed, that this history is left incomplete by\r\nthe author. [S.] Sir Walter Scott's note hardly agrees with Swift's own\r\nstatement to Stella. Writing under date May 16th, 1713, he says: \"I have\r\njust finished my Treatise, and must be ten days correcting it.\" It is\r\nevident that Swift did not intend to write a \"History of the Four Last\r\nYears of Queen Anne's Reign.\" A better title for this work would be the\r\ntitle originally given it, namely, \"History of the Peace of Utrecht.\" In\r\nthe letter already quoted from Erasmus Lewis, Swift's account of the\r\nnegotiations for the peace are thus remarked upon: \"That part of it\r\nwhich relates to the negotiations of peace, whether at London or at\r\nUtrecht, they admire exceedingly, and declare they never yet saw that,\r\nor any other transaction, drawn up with so much perspicuity, or in a\r\nstyle so entertaining and instructive to the reader in every respect.\"\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n*****       *****       *****       *****       *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF ENGLAND,\r\n\r\nFROM THE INVASION OF IT BY JULIUS CAESAR\r\n\r\nTO THE REIGN OF HENRY THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Abstract of the History of England here reprinted calls for little\r\nor no comment. It is but a dry relation of events with no touch in the\r\nrecital of any of those qualities which characterize Swift's writings.\r\nThe facts were evidently obtained from the old chroniclers. What object\r\nSwift had in writing this Abstract is not known. If the dedication to\r\nthe Count de Gyllenborg truly states his intention, it must be confessed\r\nthat the \"foreigners, and gentlemen of our own country\" had not much\r\nupon which to congratulate themselves. Why Swift should have chosen the\r\nCount de Gyllenborg to whom to address the dedication must also remain a\r\nmatter for conjecture. The Count had been sent out of the British Isles\r\nfor instigating a conspiracy for a Jacobite insurrection in Great\r\nBritain. Swift wrote his dedication three years after the Count's\r\nexpulsion. Knowing that the Count's master, Charles XII. of Sweden, had\r\nbeen a party to the plot, he yet writes in a most amiable tone of\r\nfriendliness towards both, with a parenthetical sneer at \"his present\r\nBritannic Majesty.\" Undoubtedly this dedication might easily and fairly\r\nbe taken as strong presumptive evidence of a leaning on Swift's part\r\ntowards the Pretender. It will, however, be more truly interpreted, if\r\nit be considered as an expression of contempt for the King of England\r\nand the ministry in power.\r\n\r\nThe text of the present reprint is that given by Deane Swift from his\r\nedition of his kinsman's works issued in 1765 and 1768 (4to edit, vols.\r\nviii. and xiii.). Deane Swift thought that the narratives of Rufus,\r\nHenry I. and Stephen, would \"appear to be such a model of English\r\nhistory, as will make all men of taste, and especially foreigners,\r\nregret that he pursued his plan no further.\"\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE GYLLENBORG.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Charles, Count Gyllenborg (1679-1746), was Swedish\r\nAmbassador at London 1710-16.

[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nDublin in Ireland, Nov. 2, 1719.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIt is now about sixteen years since I first entertained the design of\r\nwriting a History of England, from the beginning of William Rufus to the\r\nend of Queen Elizabeth; such a History, I mean, as appears to be most\r\nwanted by foreigners, and gentlemen of our own country; not a voluminous\r\nwork, nor properly an abridgement, but an exact relation of the most\r\nimportant affairs and events, without any regard to the rest. My\r\nintention was to inscribe it to the King[2] your late master, for whose\r\ngreat virtues I had ever the highest veneration, as I shall continue to\r\nbear to his memory. I confess it is with some disdain that I observe\r\ngreat authors descending to write any dedications at all: and for my own\r\npart, when I looked round on all the princes of Europe, I could think of\r\nnone who might deserve that distinction from me, besides the King your\r\nmaster; (for I say nothing of his present Britannic Majesty, to whose\r\nperson and character I am an utter stranger, and like to continue so)\r\nneither can I be suspected of flattery on this point, since it was some\r\nyears after that I had the honour of an invitation to his court, before\r\nyou were employed as his minister in England, which I heartily repent\r\nthat I did not accept; whereby, as you can be my witness, I might have\r\navoided some years' uneasiness and vexation, during the last four years\r\nof our late excellent Queen, as well as a long melancholy prospect\r\nsince, in a most obscure disagreeable country, and among a most\r\nprofligate and abandoned people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Charles XII., King of Sweden, who was killed in 1718. [D.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\nI was diverted from pursuing this History, partly by the extreme\r\ndifficulty, but chiefly by the indignation I conceived at the\r\nproceedings of a faction, which then prevailed; and the papers lay\r\nneglected in my cabinet until you saw me in England; when you know how\r\nfar I was engaged in thoughts and business of another kind. Upon Her\r\nMajesty's lamented death, I returned to my station in this kingdom;\r\nsince which time there is not a northern curate among you who hath lived\r\nmore obscure than myself, or a greater stranger to the commonest\r\ntransactions of the world. It is but very lately that I found the\r\nfollowing papers, which I had almost forgotten.

[D.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AN ABSTRACT OF THE HISTORY\r\n  OF ENGLAND,\r\n  FROM THE INVASION OF IT BY JULIUS CAESAR\r\n  TO WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Britons.\r\n  Heathens.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient account we have of Britain is, that the island was full\r\nof inhabitants, divided into several petty kingdoms, as most nations of\r\nthe world appear to have been at first. The bodies of the Britons were\r\npainted with a sky-coloured blue, either as an ornament or else for\r\nterror to their enemies. In their religion they were heathens, as all\r\nthe world was before Christ, except the Jews.\r\n\r\n  Druids.\r\n\r\nTheir priests were called Druids: These lived in hollow trees, and\r\ncommitted not their mysteries to writing, but delivered them down by\r\ntradition, whereby they were in time wholly lost.\r\n\r\nThe Britons had wives in common, so many to a particular tribe or\r\nsociety, and the children were in common to that society.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years before Christ, Julius Caesar, the first Roman Emperor,\r\nhaving conquered Gaul or France, invaded Britain rather to increase his\r\nglory than conquests; for having overcome the natives in one or two\r\nbattles, he returned.\r\n\r\n  Claudius.\r\n  Nero.\r\n\r\nThe next invasion of Britain by the Romans (then masters of most of the\r\nknown world) was in the reign of the Emperor Claudius; but it was not\r\nwholly subdued till that of Nero. It was governed by lieutenants, or\r\ndeputies, sent from Rome, as Ireland is now by deputies from England;\r\nand continued thus under the Romans for about 460 years; till that\r\nempire being invaded by the Goths and Vandals, the Romans were forced\r\nnot only to recall their own armies, but also to draw from hence the\r\nbravest of the Britons, for their assistance against those barbarians.\r\n\r\n  Picts.\r\n  Picts' Wall.\r\n\r\nThe Roman conquests in this island reached no further northward than to\r\nthat part of Scotland where Stirling and Glasgow are seated: The region\r\nbeyond was held not worth the conquering: It was inhabited by a\r\nbarbarous people, called Caledonians and Picts; who, being a rough\r\nfierce nation, daily infested the British borders. Therefore the Emperor\r\nSeverus built a wall, from Stirling to Glasgow, to prevent the invasions\r\nof the Picts: It is commonly called the Picts' Wall.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 455. Saxons.\r\n\r\nThese Picts and Caledonians, or Scots, encouraged by the departure of\r\nthe Romans, do now cruelly infest and invade the Britons by sea and\r\nland: The Britons choose Vortigern for their king, who was forced to\r\ninvite the Saxons (a fierce Northern people) to assist him against those\r\nbarbarians. The Saxons came over, and beat the Picts in several battles;\r\nbut, at last, pick quarrels with the Britons themselves; and, after a\r\nlong war, drive them into the mountains of Wales and Cornwall, and\r\nestablish themselves in seven kingdoms in Britain, (by them now called\r\nEngland). These seven kingdoms are usually styled the Saxon Heptarchy.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 460. Arthur.\r\n\r\nAbout this time lived King Arthur (if the whole story be not a fable)\r\nwho was so famous for beating the Saxons in several battles.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 600. Austin.\r\n\r\nThe Britons received Christianity very early, and, as is reported, from\r\nsome of the Disciples themselves: So that, when the Romans left Britain,\r\nthe Britons were generally Christians. But the Saxons were heathens,\r\ntill Pope Gregory the Great sent over hither Austin the monk, by whom\r\nEthelbert king of the South-Saxons, and his subjects, were converted to\r\nChristianity; and the whole island soon followed the example.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 819. Egbert.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The edition of 1765 gives the date as 819, but according to\r\nDr. Stubbs, Egbert became _bretwalda_ in 828. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nAfter many various revolutions in this island among the kingdoms of the\r\nSaxons, Egbert, descended from the West-Saxon kings, became sole monarch\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n  Angles.\r\n\r\nThe language in Britain was British, (now called Welsh) or Latin; but,\r\nwith the Saxons, English came in (although extremely different from what\r\nit is now). The present names of towns, shires, &c. were given by them;\r\nand the whole kingdom was called England from the Angles, who were a\r\nbranch of the Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Danes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Saxons were settled, the Danes began to trouble and\r\ninvade them, as they (the Saxons) had before done the Britons.\r\n\r\nThese Danes came out of Germany, Denmark, and Norway, a rough warlike\r\npeople, little different from the Saxons to whom they were nigh\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n  Edgar.\r\n\r\nAfter many invasions from the Danes, Edgar King of England sets forth\r\nthe first navy. He was entitled King of all Albion, (an old name of this\r\nisland) and was the first absolute monarch.\r\n\r\nHe made peace with the Danes, and allowed them to live in his dominions\r\nmixed with the English.\r\n\r\nIn this prince's time there were five kings in Wales, who all did him\r\nhomage for their country.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 978. Danes massacred.\r\n\r\nThese Danes began first to make their invasions here about the year 800,\r\nwhich they after renewed at several times, and under several leaders,\r\nand were as often repulsed. They used to come with vast numbers of\r\nships, burn and ravage before them, as the cities of London, Winchester,\r\n&c. Encouraged by success and prey, they often wintered in England,\r\nfortifying themselves in the northern parts, from whence they cruelly\r\ninfested the Saxon kings. In process of time they mixed with the English\r\n(as was said before) and lived under the Saxon government: But Ethelred,\r\nthen King of England, growing weary of the Danish insolence, a\r\nconspiracy is formed, and the Danes are massacred in one day all over\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n  Sweyn.\r\n\r\nFour years after, Sweyn, King of Denmark, to revenge the death of his\r\nsubjects, invades England; and, after battles fought and much cruelty\r\nexercised, he subdues the whole kingdom, forcing Ethelred to fly into\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\n  Canutus.\r\n\r\nSweyn dying, his son Canutus succeeds in the kingdom; but Ethelred\r\nreturning with an army, Canutus is forced to withdraw to Denmark for\r\nsuccour.\r\n\r\nEthelred dies, and his son Edmond Ironside succeeds; but, Canutus\r\nreturning with fresh forces from Denmark, after several battles, the\r\nkingdom is parted between them both. Edmond dying, his sons are sent\r\nbeyond sea by Canutus, who now is sole King of England.\r\n\r\n  King's evil.\r\n\r\nHardicanute, the last Danish king, dying without issue, Edward, son of\r\nEthelred, is chosen king. For his great holiness, he was surnamed the\r\nConfessor, and sainted after his death. He was the first of our princes\r\nthat attempted to cure the king's evil by touching. He first introduced\r\nwhat is now called the Common Law. In his time began the mode and\r\nhumour among the English gentry, of using the French tongue and\r\nfashions, in compliance with the king, who had been bred up in Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe Danish government in England lasted but twenty-six years, under\r\nthree kings.\r\n\r\n  Harold.\r\n\r\nEdward the Confessor married the daughter of Earl Godwin, an English\r\nnobleman of great power, but of Danish extraction; but, wanting issue,\r\nhe appointed Edgar Atheling, grandson to his brother, to succeed him,\r\nand Harold, son of Earl Godwin, to be governor of the young prince. But,\r\nupon Edward's death, Harold neglected Edgar Atheling, and usurped the\r\ncrown for himself.\r\n\r\nEdward, while he was in Normandy, met so good reception, that it was\r\nsaid he made a promise to that duke, that, in case he recovered his\r\nkingdom, and died without issue, he would leave it to him. Edward dying,\r\nWilliam Duke of Normandy sends to Harold to claim the crown; but Harold,\r\nnow in possession, resolves to keep it. Upon which Duke William, having\r\nprepared a mighty fleet and army, invades England, lands at Hastings,\r\nand sets fire to his fleet, to cut off all hope from his men of\r\nreturning. To Harold he sent his messenger, demanding the kingdom and\r\nhis subjection: But Harold returned him this answer, \"That, unless he\r\ndeparted his land, he would make him sensible of his just displeasure.\"\r\nSo Harold advanced his forces into Sussex, within seven miles of his\r\nenemy. The Norman Duke, to save the effusion of blood, sent these offers\r\nto Harold; either wholly to resign the kingdom to him, or to try the\r\nquarrel with him in single combat. To this Harold did not agree.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1066.\r\n\r\nThen the battle joined. The Normans had gotten the worst, if it had not\r\nbeen for a stratagem they invented, which got them the day. In this\r\nengagement Harold was killed, and William Duke of Normandy became King\r\nof England, under the name of William the Conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF WILLIAM THE SECOND,\r\n\r\nSURNAMED RUFUS.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Conqueror's death, his eldest son Robert, upon some\r\ndiscontent with his father, being absent in France,[5] William, the\r\nsecond son, made use of this juncture, and without attending his\r\nfather's funeral, hastened to England, where, pursuant to the will of\r\nthe deceased prince,[6] the nobility, although more inclined to favour\r\nRobert, were prevailed with to admit him King, partly by his promises to\r\nabate the rigour of the late reign, and restore the laws and liberties\r\nwhich had been then abolished, but chiefly by the credit and\r\nsolicitations of Lanfranc; for that prelate had formerly a share in his\r\neducation, and always a great affection for his person. At Winchester he\r\ntook possession of his father's treasure,[7] in obedience to whose\r\ncommand, as well as to ingratiate himself with the people, he\r\ndistributed it among churches and religious houses, and applied it to\r\nthe redeeming of prisoners, and other acts of popularity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5:  He was then at Abbeville in Picardy. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6:  William the Conqueror left Normandy to his son Robert; but\r\nsaid of England: \"So it pleased God, he should be glad that William, his\r\nobedient and best beloved son, should enjoy it after his death.\" [D.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7:  Which was sixty thousand pounds in silver, besides gold,\r\njewels, and plate.--BROMPTON. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Robert returned to Normandy, took possession of that\r\nduchy, with great applause and content of his people, and, spited at the\r\nindignity done him by his father, and the usurpation of his brother in\r\nconsequence thereof, prepared a great fleet and army to invade England;\r\nnor did there want an occasion to promote his interest, if the slowness,\r\nthe softness, and credulity of his nature, could have suffered him to\r\nmake a right improvement of it.\r\n\r\nOdo Bishop of Bayeux,[8] of whom frequent mention is made in the\r\npreceding reign,[9] a prelate of incurable ambition, either on account\r\nof his age or character being restored to his liberty and possessions in\r\nEngland, grew into envy and discontent, upon seeing Lanfranc preferred\r\nbefore him by the new King in his favour and ministry. He therefore\r\nformed a conspiracy with several nobles of Norman birth to depose the\r\nKing, and sent an invitation to Robert to hasten over. Mean time the\r\nconspirators, in order to distract the King's forces, seized on several\r\nparts of England at once; Bristol, Norwich, Leicester, Worcester,\r\nShrewsbury, Bath, and Durham, were secured by several noblemen: Odo\r\nhimself seized Rochester, reduced the coasts of Kent, and sent messages\r\nto Robert to make all possible speed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Odo was half brother to William the Conqueror. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Sir W. Temple wrote \"An Introduction to the History of\r\nEngland.\" As it only extended to the death of William the Conqueror it\r\nis probable that it is what is here referred to. It will be found in\r\nvol. ii. of Sir W. Temple's \"Works,\" edited by Swift. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe King alarmed at these many and sudden defections, thought it his\r\nbest course to begin his defence by securing the good will of the\r\npeople. He redressed many grievances, eased them of certain oppressive\r\ntaxes and tributes, gave liberty to hunt in his forest, with other marks\r\nof indulgence, which however forced from him by the necessity of the\r\ntime, he had the skill or fortune so to order as they neither lost their\r\ngood grace nor effect; for immediately after he raised great forces both\r\nby land and sea, marched into Kent, where the chief body of his enemies\r\nwas in arms, recovered Tunbridge and Pevensey, in the latter of which\r\nOdo himself was taken prisoner, and forced to accompany the King to\r\nRochester. This city refusing to surrender at the King's summons, Odo\r\nundertook to prevail with the obstinacy of the inhabitants; but being\r\nadmitted into the town, was there detained, either by a real or seeming\r\nforce; however, the King provoked at their stubbornness and fraud, soon\r\ncompelled them to yield, retook his prisoner, and forcing him for ever\r\nto abjure England, sent him into Normandy.\r\n\r\nBy these actions, performed with such great celerity and success, the\r\npreparations of Duke Robert were wholly disappointed, himself, by the\r\nnecessity of his affairs, compelled to a treaty with his brother, upon\r\nthe terms of a small pension, and a mutual promise of succeeding to each\r\nother's dominions on failure of issue, forced to resign his pretensions,\r\nand return with a shattered fleet to Normandy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time died Archbishop Lanfranc; by whose death the King,\r\nloosed from that awe and constraint he was under, soon began to discover\r\nthose irregularities of his nature, which till then he had suppressed\r\nand disguised, falling into those acts of oppression and extortion that\r\nhave made his name and memory infamous. He kept the see of Canterbury\r\nfour years vacant, and converted the revenues to his own use, together\r\nwith those of several other bishoprics and abbeys, and disposed all\r\nchurch preferments to the highest bidder. Nor were his exactions less\r\nupon the laity, from whom he continually extorted exorbitant fines for\r\npretended transgression of certain penal laws, and entertained informers\r\nto observe men's actions and bring him intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt is here worth observation, that these corrupt proceedings of the\r\nprince have, in the opinion of several learned men, given rise to two\r\ncustoms, which are a long time grown to have the force of laws. For,\r\nfirst the successors of this King, continuing the custom of seizing on\r\nthe accruing rents in the vacancy of sees and abbeys, it grew in process\r\nof time to be exacted as a right, or acknowledgment to the King as\r\nfounder; whence the revenues of vacant bishoprics belong at this day to\r\nthe crown. The second custom had an original not unlike. Several\r\npersons, to avoid the persecutions of the King's informers, and other\r\ninstruments of oppression, withdrew themselves and their effects to\r\nforeign countries; upon which the King issued a proclamation, forbidding\r\nall men to leave the kingdom without his licence; from whence, in the\r\njudgment of the same authors, the writ _ne exeat regno_ had its\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nBy these and the like arbitrary methods having amassed great treasures,\r\nand finding all things quiet at home, he raised a powerful army to\r\ninvade his brother in Normandy; but upon what ground or pretext, the\r\nwriters of that age are not very exact; whether it were from a principle\r\nfrequent among unjust princes, That old oppressions are best justified\r\nby new; or, whether having a talent for sudden enterprises, and justly\r\napprehending the resentments of Duke Robert, he thought it the wiser\r\ncourse to prevent injuries than to revenge them. In this expedition he\r\ntook several cities and castles from his brother, and would have\r\nproceeded further, if Robert had not desired and obtained the assistance\r\nof Philip King of France, who came with an army to his relief. King\r\nWilliam not thinking it safe or prudent to proceed further against his\r\nenemy supported by so great an ally, yet loth to lose the fruits of his\r\ntime and valour, fell upon a known and old expedient, which no prince\r\never practised oftener, or with greater success, and that was, to buy\r\noff the French King with a sum of money. This had its effect; for that\r\nprince not able to oppose such powerful arms, immediately withdrew\r\nhimself and his forces, leaving the two brothers to concert the measures\r\nof a peace.\r\n\r\nThis was treated and agreed with great advantages on the side of King\r\nWilliam; for he kept all the towns he had taken, obliged his brother to\r\nbanish Edgar Atheling out of Normandy, and, for a further security,\r\nbrought over with him to England the Duke himself to attend him in his\r\nexpedition against Malcolm King of Scotland, who during his absence had\r\ninvaded the borders. The King having raised great forces both by sea and\r\nland, went in person to repel the inroads of the Scots: but the\r\nenterprise was without success; for the greatest part of his fleet was\r\ndestroyed by a tempest, and his army very much diminished by sickness\r\nand famine, which forced him to a peace of little honour; by which, upon\r\nthe condition of homage from that prince, the King of England agreed to\r\ndeliver him up those twelve towns (or manors) in England which Malcolm\r\nhad held under William the Conqueror; together with a pension of twelve\r\nthousand marks.\r\n\r\nAt this time were sown the seeds of another quarrel between him and Duke\r\nRobert, who soliciting the King to perform some covenants of the last\r\npeace, and meeting with a repulse, withdrew in great discontent to\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\nKing William, in his return from Scotland, fell dangerously sick at\r\nGloucester, where, moved by the seasonable exhortations of his clergy,\r\nor rather by the fears of dying, he began to discover great marks of\r\nrepentance, with many promises of amendment and retribution,\r\nparticularly for his injuries to the Church. To give credit to which\r\ngood resolutions, he immediately filled several vacant sees, giving that\r\nof Canterbury to Anselm, a foreigner of great fame for piety and\r\nlearning. But as it is the disposition of men who derive their vices\r\nfrom their complexions, that their passions usually beat strong and weak\r\nwith their pulses, so it fared with this prince, who upon recovery of\r\nhis health soon forgot the vows he had made in his sickness, relapsing\r\nwith greater violence into the same irregularities of injustice and\r\noppression, whereof Anselm, the new archbishop, felt the first effects.\r\nThis prelate, soon after his promotion, offered the King a sum of money\r\nby way of present; but took care it should be so small, that none might\r\ninterpret it to be a consideration of his late preferment. The King\r\nrejected it with scorn; and as he used but little ceremony in such\r\nmatters, insisted in plain terms for more. Anselm would not comply; and\r\nthe King enraged, sought all occasions to make him uneasy; until at\r\nlength the poor archbishop, tired out with perpetual usurpations (or at\r\nleast what was then understood to be such) upon his jurisdiction,\r\nprivileges, and possessions, desired the King licence for a journey to\r\nRome; and upon a refusal, went without it. As soon as he was withdrawn,\r\nthe King seized on all his revenues, converting them to his own use, and\r\nthe archbishop continued an exile until the succeeding reign.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of this quarrel between the King and archbishop are not,\r\nin my opinion, considerable enough to deserve a place in this brief\r\ncollection, being of little use to posterity, and of less entertainment;\r\nneither should I have mentioned it at all, but for the occasion it gives\r\nme of making a general observation, which may afford some light into the\r\nnature and disposition of those ages. Not only this King's father and\r\nhimself, but the princes for several successions, of the fairest\r\ncharacter, have been severely taxed for violating the rights of the\r\nclergy, and perhaps not altogether without reason. It is true, this\r\ncharacter hath made the lighter impression, as proceeding altogether\r\nfrom the party injured, the cotemporary writers being generally\r\nchurchmen: and it must be confessed, that the usurpations of the Church\r\nand court of Rome were in those ages risen to such heights, as to be\r\naltogether inconsistent either with the legislature or administration of\r\nany independent state; the inferior clergy, both secular and regular,\r\ninsisting upon such immunities as wholly exempted them from the civil\r\npower; and the bishops removing all controversies with the crown by\r\nappeal to Rome: for they reduced the matter to this short issue, That\r\nGod was to be obeyed rather than men; and consequently the Bishop of\r\nRome, who is Christ's representative, rather than an earthly prince.\r\nNeither doth it seem improbable that all Christendom would have been in\r\nutter vassalage, both temporal and spiritual, to the Roman see, if the\r\nReformation had not put a stop to those exorbitancies, and in a good\r\nmeasure opened the eyes even of those princes and states who still\r\nadhere to the doctrines and discipline of that church.\r\n\r\nWhile the King continued at Gloucester, Malcolm King of Scotland came to\r\nhis court, with intentions to settle and confirm the late peace between\r\nthem. It happened that a controversy arose about some circumstances\r\nrelating to the homage which Malcolm was to pay, in the managing whereof\r\nKing William discovered so much haughtiness and disdain, both in words\r\nand gestures, that the Scottish prince, provoked by such unworthy\r\ntreatment, returned home with indignation; but soon came back at the\r\nhead of a powerful army, and, entering Northumberland with fire and\r\nsword, laid all waste before him. But as all enterprises have in the\r\nprogress of them a tincture of those passions by which they were\r\nspirited at first, so this invasion begun upon private revenge, which is\r\na blind ungovernable passion, was carried on with equal precipitation,\r\nand proved to be ruinous in the event; for Robert Mowbray, Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, to prevent the destruction of his own country, where he\r\nhad great possessions, gathering what forces he could suddenly raise,\r\nand without waiting any directions from the King, marched against the\r\nScots, who were then set down before Alnwick Castle: there, by an\r\nambush, Malcolm and his eldest son Edward were slain, and the army,\r\ndiscouraged by the loss of their princes, entirely defeated. This\r\ndisaster was followed in a few days by the death of Queen Margaret, who,\r\nnot able to survive her misfortunes, died for grief. Neither did the\r\nmiseries of that kingdom end till, after two usurpations, the surviving\r\nson of Malcolm, who had fled to England for refuge, was restored to his\r\ncrown by the assistance of King William.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the hidden sparks of animosity between the two brothers,\r\nburied but not extinguished in the last peace, began to flame out into\r\nnew dissensions. Duke Robert had often sent his complaints to the King\r\nfor breach of articles, but without redress, which provoked him to\r\nexpostulate in a rougher manner, till at length he charged the King in\r\nplain terms with injustice and perjury, but no men are found to endure\r\nreproaches with less temper than those who most deserve them, the King,\r\nat the same time filled with indignation, and stung with guilt, invaded\r\nNormandy a second time, resolving to reduce his brother to such terms as\r\nmight stop all further complaints. He had already taken several strong\r\nholds, by force either of arms or of money, and intending entirely to\r\nsubdue the duchy, gave orders to have twenty thousand men immediately\r\nraised in England, and sent over to him. The Duke, to defend himself\r\nagainst these formidable preparations, had recourse again to his old\r\nally the King of France, who very readily advanced with an army to his\r\nassistance, as an action wherein he could every way find his own\r\naccounts, for, beside the appearance of glory and justice by protecting\r\nthe injured, he fought indeed his own battle, by preserving his\r\nneighbouring state in the hands of a peaceful prince, from so powerful\r\nand restless an enemy as the King of England, and was largely paid for\r\nhis trouble into the bargain, for King William, either loth to engage in\r\na long and dangerous war, or hastened back by intelligence of some\r\ntroubles from Wales, sent offers to his army, just ready to embark for\r\nNormandy, that upon payment of ten shillings a man they might have leave\r\nto return to their own homes.[10] This bargain was generally accepted,\r\nthe money was paid to the King of France, who immediately withdrew his\r\ntroops, and King William, now master of the conditions, forced his\r\nbrother to a peace upon much harder terms than before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See reference to this incident in \"The Examiner,\" No. 21\r\n(vol. ix of this edition, p. 123)  [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nIn this passage there are some circumstances which may appear odd and\r\nunaccountable to those who will not give due allowance for the\r\ndifference of times and manners: that an absent prince, engaged in an\r\nunjust war with his own brother, and ill-beloved at home, should have so\r\nmuch power and credit, as by his commission to raise twenty thousand men\r\non a sudden, only as a recruit to the army he had already with him; that\r\nhe should have a fleet prepared ready, and large enough to transport so\r\ngreat a number; that upon the very point of embarking he should send\r\nthem so disgraceful an offer; and that so great a number of common\r\nsoldiers should be able and willing to pay such a sum of money, equal to\r\nat least twelve time as much in our times; and that, after being thus\r\ndeluded and spoiled at once, they should peaceably disband and retire to\r\ntheir several homes. But all this will be less difficult to comprehend,\r\nwhen we reflect on the method of raising and supporting armies, very\r\ndifferent from ours, which was then in use, and so continued for many\r\nages after. All men who had lands _in capite_ were bound to attend the\r\nKing in his wars with a proportioned number of soldiers, who were their\r\ntenants on easy rents in consideration of military service. This was but\r\nthe work of a few days, and the troops consisted of such men as were\r\nable to maintain their own charges either at home or abroad: neither was\r\nthere any reason to apprehend that soldiers would ever become\r\ninstruments for introducing slavery, who held so great a share in the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe King, upon his return from Normandy, made an unsuccessful expedition\r\nagainst the Welsh, who upon the advantages of his absence had, according\r\nto their usual custom, made cruel inroads upon the adjoining counties of\r\nChester, Shrewsbury, and Hereford. Upon the King's approach they fled\r\ninto their fastnesses among the mountains, where he pursued them for\r\nsome time with great rage and vexation, as well as the loss of great\r\nnumbers of his men, to no purpose. From hence he was recalled by a more\r\nformidable enemy nearer home: for Robert Earl of Northumberland,\r\noverrating his late services against the Scots, as much perhaps and as\r\nunjustly as they were undervalued by the King, refused to come to his\r\ncourt, which, in those days, was looked on as the first usual mark of\r\ndiscontent in a nobleman; and was often charged by princes as a formal\r\naccusation. The earl having disobeyed the King's summons, and concerted\r\nmatters with other accomplices, broke out into open rebellion, with\r\nintentions to depose King William, and set up Stephen Earl of Albemarle,\r\nson of a sister to William the Conqueror: but all was prevented by the\r\ncelerity of this active prince; who, knowing that insurrections are best\r\nquelled in their beginnings, marched with incredible speed, and\r\nsurprised the rebels at Newcastle, took the castles of Tynemouth and\r\nBamburgh; where the obstinacy of the defendants provoked him, contrary\r\nto his nature, to commit cruelties upon their persons, by cutting off\r\ntheir hands and ears, and other the like inhumanities. The earl himself\r\nwas taken prisoner as he endeavoured to make his escape; but suffered no\r\nother punishment than to be confined for the rest of his life.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Which was thirty years. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nAbout this time began the Holy War for recovering of Palestine; which\r\nhaving not been the enterprise of any one prince or state, but that\r\nwherein most in Christendom had a share, it cannot with justice be\r\nsilently passed over in the history of any nation.\r\n\r\nPope Urban the Second, in a council at Clermont, made a pathetic\r\nexhortation, shewing with what danger and indignity to Christendom the\r\nTurks and Saracens had, for some ages, not only overrun all Asia and\r\nAfrica, where Christianity had long flourished; but had also made\r\nencroachments into Europe, where they had entirely subdued Spain, and\r\nsome other parts; that Jerusalem, the holy city, where our Saviour did\r\nso many miracles, and where His sepulchre still remained, to the scandal\r\nof the Christian name, lay groaning under the tyranny of infidels; that\r\nthe swords which Christian princes had drawn against each other, ought\r\nto be turned against the common enemy of their name and religion; that\r\nthis should be reckoned an ample satisfaction for all their past sins;\r\nthat those who died in this expedition should immediately go to Heaven,\r\nand the survivors would be blessed with the sight of our Lord's\r\nsepulchre.\r\n\r\nMoved by these arguments, and the influence of the person who delivered\r\nthem, several nobles and prelates immediately took upon them the cross;\r\nand the council dissolving in this high fit of zeal, the clergy, upon\r\ntheir return home, prevailed so far in their several countries, that in\r\nmost parts of Europe some great prince or lord became a votary for the\r\nHoly Land; as Hugh the Great, brother to the King of France; Godfrey\r\nDuke of Lorraine; Reimond Count of Toulouse; Robert Duke of Normandy,\r\nand many others. Neither ought it to be forgotten, that most of these\r\nnoble and generous princes, wanting money to maintain the forces they\r\nhad raised, pawned their dominions to those very prelates who had first\r\nengaged them in this enterprise: doubtless a notable mark of the force\r\nof oratory in the churchmen of those ages, who were able to inspire that\r\ndevotion into others, whereof they seemed so little sensible themselves.\r\n\r\nBut a great share in the honour of promoting this religious war, is\r\nattributed to the zeal and industry of a certain French priest, commonly\r\ncalled Peter the Hermit; who being at Jerusalem upon pilgrimage some\r\ntime before, and entering often into private treaty with the patriarch\r\nof that city, came back fully instructed in all the measures necessary\r\nfor such a war: to these was joined the artifice of certain dreams and\r\nvisions that might pass for divine admonition: all which, added to the\r\npiety of his exhortations, gave him such credit with the Pope, and\r\nseveral princes of Christendom, that he became in his own person the\r\nleader of a great army against the infidels, and was very instrumental\r\nfor engaging many others in the same design.\r\n\r\nWhat a spirit was thus raised in Christendom among all sorts of men,\r\ncannot better be conceived than from the vast numbers of these warlike\r\npilgrims; who, at the siege of Nice, are said to have consisted of\r\n600,000 foot, and 100,000 horse: and the success at first was answerable\r\nto the greatness of their numbers, the valour of their leaders, and the\r\nuniversal opinion of such a cause; for, besides several famous victories\r\nin the field, not to mention the towns of less importance, they took\r\nNice, Antioch, and at last Jerusalem, where Duke Godfrey was chosen king\r\nwithout competition. But zeal, with a mixture of enthusiasm, as I take\r\nthis to have been, is a composition only fit for sudden enterprises,\r\nlike a great ferment in the blood, giving double courage and strength\r\nfor the time, until it sink and settle by nature into its old channel:\r\nfor, in a few years the piety of these adventurers began to slacken, and\r\ngive way to faction and envy, the natural corruptions of all\r\nconfederacies: however, to this spirit of devotion there succeeded a\r\nspirit of honour, which long continued the vein and humour of the times;\r\nand the Holy Land became either a school, wherein young princes went to\r\nlearn the art of war, or a scene wherein they affected to shew their\r\nvalour, and gain reputation, when they were weary of peace at home.\r\n\r\nThe Christians held possession of Jerusalem above eighty years,[12] and\r\ncontinued their expeditions to the Holy Land almost as many more, with\r\nvarious events; and after they were entirely driven out of Asia, the\r\npopes have almost in every age endeavoured in vain to promote new\r\ncrusades neither does this spirit seem quite extinct among us even to\r\nthis day; the usual projects of sanguine men for uniting Christendom\r\nagainst the Turk, being without doubt a traditional way of talk derived\r\nto us from the same fountain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12:  They held it eighty-eight years; from July, 1099, to\r\nOctober, 1187. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nRobert, in order to furnish himself out for this war, pawned his duchy\r\nto the King for 10,000 marks of gold;[13] which sum was levied with so\r\nmany circumstances of rigour and exaction, towards the Church and laity,\r\nas very much increased the discontents of both against the prince.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13:  Equal to £1,400,000, as money passes now. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n  1099.\r\n\r\nI shall record one act of this king's, which being chiefly personal, may\r\npass rather for a part of his character, than a point of history.\r\n\r\nAs he was hunting one day in the New Forest, a messenger express from\r\nNormandy, brought him intelligence, that Hélie, Count de la Flèche, had\r\nlaid close siege to Mans, and expected to carry the town in a few days;\r\nthe King leaving his chase, commanded some about him to point whereabout\r\nMans lay; and so rode straight on without reflection, until he came to\r\nthe coast. His attendants advised him to wait until he had made\r\npreparations of men and money; to which he only returned; \"They that\r\nlove me, will follow me.\" He entered the ship in a violent storm; which\r\nthe mariners beholding with astonishment, at length in great humility\r\ngave him warning of the danger; but the King commanded them instantly to\r\nput off to sea, and not be afraid; for he had never in his life heard of\r\nany King that was drowned. In a few days he drove the enemy from before\r\nthe city, and took the count himself prisoner, who raging at his defeat\r\nand captivity, exclaimed,[14] \"That this blow was from Fortune; but\r\nValour could make reprisals, as he should shew, if ever he regained his\r\nliberty.\" This being told the King, he sent for the count, let him\r\nunderstand that he had heard of his menaces, then gave him a fine horse,\r\nbid him begone immediately, and defied him to do his worst.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: There is so much pleasantry and humour, as well as spirit\r\nand heroism in this story, as we have it recorded by William de\r\nMalmesbury, who represents the menace as thrown out in the King's\r\npresence, that I shall make no apology for setting down his words at\r\nlength. \"Auctor turbarum Helias capitur; cui ante se adducto rex\r\nludibundus, 'Habeo te, magister,' inquit. At ille, cujus alta nobilitas\r\nnesciret in tanto etiam periculo sapere; 'Fortuitu,' inquit, 'me\r\ncepisti: sed si possem evadere, novi quid facerem.' Tum Willelmus, prae\r\nfurore ferè extra se positus, et obuncans Heliam, 'Tu,'inquit, 'nebulo!\r\ntu, quid faceres? Discede; abi; fuge! Concede tibi ut facias quicquid\r\npoteris: et, per vultum de Luca! nihil, si me viceris, pro hâc veniâ\r\ntecum paciscar.\" _I.e._ By the face of St. Luke, if thou shouldst have\r\nthe fortune to conquer me, I scorn to compound with thee for my release.\r\n[D.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt would have been an injury to this prince's memory, to let pass an\r\naction, by which he acquired more honour than from any other in his\r\nlife, and by which it appeared that he was not without some seeds of\r\nmagnanimity, had they been better cultivated, or not overrun by the\r\nnumber or prevalency of his vices.\r\n\r\nI have met with nothing else in this King's reign that deserved to be\r\nremembered; for, as to an unsuccessful expedition or two against Wales,\r\neither by himself or his generals; they were very inconsiderable both in\r\naction and event, nor attended with any circumstances that might render\r\na relation of them of any use to posterity, either for instruction or\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nHis death was violent and unexpected, the effect of casualty; although\r\nthis perhaps is the only misfortune of life to which the person of a\r\nprince is generally less subject than that of other men. Being at his\r\nbeloved exercise of hunting in the New Forest in Hampshire, a large stag\r\ncrossed the way before him, the King hot on his game, cried out in haste\r\nto Walter Tyrrel, a knight of his attendants, to shoot; Tyrrel,\r\nimmediately let fly his arrow, which glancing against a tree, struck the\r\nKing through the heart, who fell dead to the ground without speaking a\r\nword. Upon the surprise of this accident, all his attendants, and\r\nTyrrel[15] among the rest, fled different ways; until the fright being a\r\nlittle over, some of them returned, and causing the body to be laid in a\r\ncollier's cart, for want of other conveniency, conveyed it in a very\r\nunbecoming contemptuous manner to Winchester, where it was buried the\r\nnext day without solemnity, and which is worse, without grief.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Yet Eadmer saith, that Tyrrel told him, he had not been in\r\nthe Forest that day. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nI shall conclude the history of this prince's reign, with a description\r\nand character of his body and mind, impartially from the collections I\r\nhave made; which method I shall observe likewise in all the succeeding\r\nreigns.\r\n\r\nHe was in stature somewhat below the usual size, and big-bellied, but he\r\nwas well and strongly knit. His hair was yellow or sandy; his face red,\r\nwhich got him the name of Rufus; his forehead flat; his eyes were\r\nspotted, and appeared of different colours; he was apt to stutter in\r\nspeaking, especially when he was angry; he was vigorous and active, and\r\nvery hardy to endure fatigues, which he owed to a good constitution of\r\nhealth, and the frequent exercise of hunting; in his dress he affected\r\ngaiety and expense, which having been first introduced by this prince\r\ninto his court and kingdom, grew, in succeeding reigns, an intolerable\r\ngrievance. He also first brought in among us the luxury and profusion of\r\ngreat tables. There was in him, as in all other men, a mixture of\r\nvirtues and vices, and that in a pretty equal degree, only the\r\nmisfortune was, that the latter, although not more numerous, were yet\r\nmuch more prevalent than the former. For being entirely a man of\r\npleasure, this made him sacrifice all his good qualities, and gave him\r\ntoo many occasions of producing his ill ones. He had one very singular\r\nvirtue for a prince, which was that of being true to his word and\r\npromise: he was of undoubted personal valour, whereof the writers in\r\nthose ages produce several instances; nor did he want skill and conduct\r\nin the process of war. But, his peculiar excellency, was that of great\r\ndispatch, which, however usually decried, and allowed to be only a happy\r\ntemerity, does often answer all the ends of secrecy and counsel in a\r\ngreat commander, by surprising and daunting an enemy when he least\r\nexpects it; as may appear by the greatest actions and events upon the\r\nrecords of every nation.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of sound natural sense, as well as of wit and humour, upon\r\noccasion. There were several tenets in the Romish Church he could not\r\ndigest; particularly that of the saints' intercession; and living in an\r\nage overrun with superstition, he went so far into the other extreme, as\r\nto be censured for an atheist. The day before his death, a monk relating\r\na terrible dream, which seemed to forebode him some misfortune, the King\r\nbeing told the matter, turned it into a jest; said, \"The man was a monk,\r\nand dreamt like a monk, for lucre sake;\" and therefore commanded\r\nFitzhamon to give him an hundred shillings, that he might not complain\r\nhe had dreamt to no purpose.\r\n\r\nHis vices appear to have been rather derived from the temper of his\r\nbody, than any original depravity of his mind; for being of a sanguine\r\ncomplexion, wholly bent upon his pleasures, and prodigal in his nature,\r\nhe became engaged in great expenses. To supply these, the people were\r\nperpetually oppressed with illegal taxes and exactions; but that sort of\r\navarice which arises from prodigality and vice, as it is always needy,\r\nso it is much more ravenous and violent than the other, which put the\r\nKing and his evil instruments (among whom Ralph, Bishop of Durham, is of\r\nspecial infamy) upon those pernicious methods of gratifying his\r\nextravagances by all manner of oppression; whereof some are already\r\nmentioned, and others are too foul to relate.\r\n\r\nHe is generally taxed by writers for discovering a contempt of religion\r\nin his common discourse and behaviour; which I take to have risen from\r\nthe same fountain, being a point of art, and a known expedient, for men\r\nwho cannot quit their immoralities, at least to banish all reflections\r\nthat may disturb them in the enjoyment, which must be done either by not\r\nthinking of religion at all; or, if it will obtrude, by putting it out\r\nof countenance.\r\n\r\nYet there is one instance that might shew him to have some sense of\r\nreligion as well as justice. When two monks were outvying each other in\r\ncanting[16] the price of an abbey, he observed a third at some distance,\r\nwho said never a word; the King demanded why he would not offer; the\r\nmonk said, he was poor, and besides, would give nothing if he were ever\r\nso rich; the King replied, \"Then you are the fittest person to have it,\"\r\nand immediately gave it him. But this is, perhaps with reason enough,\r\nassigned more to caprice than conscience; for he was under the power of\r\nevery humour and passion that possessed him for the present; which made\r\nhim obstinate in his resolves, and unsteady in the prosecution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: An Irish phrase for selling or buying by auction. It is\r\nsomewhat remarkable that so severe a critic should have used such a word\r\nin historical composition. [S.]]\r\n\r\nHe had one vice or folly that seemed rooted in his mind, and of all\r\nothers, most unbefitting a prince: This was, a proud disdainful manner,\r\nboth in his words and gesture; and having already lost the love of his\r\nsubjects by his avarice and oppression, this finished the work, by\r\nbringing him into contempt and hatred among his servants; so that few\r\namong the worst of princes have had the luck to be so ill beloved, or so\r\nlittle lamented.\r\n\r\nHe never married, having an invincible abhorrence for the state,\r\nalthough not for the sex.\r\n\r\nHe died in the thirteenth year of his reign, the forty-third of his age,\r\nand of Christ 1100, August 2.\r\n\r\nHis works of piety were few, but in buildings he was very expensive,\r\nexceeding any King of England before or since, among which Westminster\r\nHall, Windsor Castle, the Tower of London, and the whole city of\r\nCarlisle, remain lasting monuments of his magnificence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF HENRY THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nThis prince was the youngest son of William the Conqueror, and bred to\r\nmore learning than was usual in that age, or to his rank, which got him\r\nthe surname of Beauclerk; the reputation whereof, together with his\r\nbeing born in England, and born son of a king, although of little weight\r\nin themselves, did very much strengthen his pretensions with the people.\r\nBesides, he had the same advantage of his brother Robert's absence,\r\nwhich had proved before so successful to Rufus, whose treasures he\r\nlikewise seized on immediately at his death, after the same manner, and\r\nfor the same end, as Rufus did those of his father the Conqueror. Robert\r\nhad been now five years absent in the Holy War, where he acquitted\r\nhimself with great glory; and although he was now in Apulia, upon his\r\nreturn homeward, yet the nobles pretending not to know what was become\r\nof him, and others giving out that he had been elected King of\r\nJerusalem, Henry laid hold of the occasion, and calling together an\r\nassembly of the clergy, nobles, and people of the realm at London, upon\r\nhis promises to restore King Edward's laws, and redress the grievances\r\nwhich had been introduced by his father and brother, they consented to\r\nelect him king. Immediately after his coronation, he proceeded upon\r\nreforming the abuses of the late reign: he banished dissolute persons\r\nfrom the court, who had long infested it under the protection and\r\nexample of Rufus: he restored the people to the use of lights in the\r\nnight, which the Conqueror had forbidden, after a certain hour, by the\r\nringing of a bell. Then he published his charter, and ordered a copy\r\nthereof to be taken for every county in England. This charter was in\r\nsubstance; The freedom of Mother Church from former oppressions; leave\r\nto the heirs of nobles to succeed in the possession of their lands,\r\nwithout being obliged to redeem them, only paying to the king a moderate\r\nrelief; abolition of fines for licence of marriage to their heiresses; a\r\npromise of not refusing such licence unless the match proposed be with\r\nthe king's enemy,[17] &c.; the next of kin to be guardians of the lands\r\nof orphans; punishments for coiners of false money; a confirmation of\r\nSt. Edward's laws; and a general amnesty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _i.e._ with a traitor or malcontent. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he performed two acts of justice, which, by\r\ngratifying the revenge and the love of the people, gained very much upon\r\ntheir affections to his person: the first was, to imprison Ralph Bishop\r\nof Durham,[18] who having been raised by the late king from a mean and\r\nsordid birth to be his prime confidant and minister, became the chief\r\ninstrument, as well as contriver, of all his oppressions: the second\r\nwas, in recalling and restoring Archbishop Anselm, who having been\r\nforced by the continual persecutions of the same prince, to leave\r\nEngland, had lived ever since in banishment, and deprived of all his\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Le Neve says that Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Durham, was\r\nimprisoned in the Tower, September, 1100, but escaped in February of the\r\nfollowing year, and fled to Normandy. (\"Fasti,\" iii. 282-3). [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nThe King had not been many months on his throne, when the news came that\r\nDuke Robert, returned from the Holy Land, was received by his subjects\r\nwith great marks of joy and honour, and in universal reputation for his\r\nvalour and success against the infidels: soon after which, Ralph Bishop\r\nof Durham, either by the negligence or corruption of his keepers,\r\nescaped out of prison, and fled over to the Duke; whom he stirred up to\r\nrenew and solicit his pretensions to the crown of England, by writing to\r\nseveral nobles, who, either through old friendship, or new discontent,\r\nor an opinion of his title, gave him promises of their assistance, as\r\nsoon as he should land in England: but the Duke having returned\r\nexceeding poor from the Holy Land, was not yet in a condition for such\r\nan undertaking, and therefore thought fit to defer it to a more\r\nseasonable opportunity.\r\n\r\nAs the King had hitherto, with great industry, sought all occasions to\r\ngratify his people, so he continued to do in the choice of a wife. This\r\nwas Matilda, daughter of Malcolm the late King of Scots; a lady of great\r\npiety and virtue, who, by the power or persuasion of her friends, was\r\nprevailed with to leave her cloister for a crown, after she had, as some\r\nwriters report, already taken the veil. Her mother was sister to Edgar\r\nAtheling, the last heir-male of the Saxon race; of whom frequent mention\r\nhath been made in the two preceding reigns: and thus the Saxon line, to\r\nthe great contentment of the English nation, was again restored.\r\n\r\nDuke Robert, having now with much difficulty and oppression of his\r\nsubjects, raised great forces, and gotten ready a fleet to convey them,\r\nresolved once more to assert his title to the crown of England: to which\r\nend he had for some time held a secret correspondence with several\r\nnobles, and lately received fresh invitations. The King, on the other\r\nside, who had received timely intelligence of his brother's\r\npreparations, gave orders to his admirals to watch the sea-ports, and\r\nendeavour to hinder the enemy's landing: but the commanders of several\r\nships, whether Robert had won them by his bribes, or his promises,\r\ninstead of offering resistance, became his guides, and brought his fleet\r\nsafe into Portsmouth, where he landed his men, and from thence marched\r\nto Winchester, his army hourly increasing by great numbers of people,\r\nwho had either an affection for his person, an opinion of his title, or\r\na hatred to the King. In the mean time Henry advanced with his forces,\r\nto be near the Duke, and observe his motions; but, like a wise general,\r\nforbore offering battle to an invader, until he might do it with\r\nmanifest advantage. Besides, he knew very well that his brother was a\r\nperson whose policy was much inferior to his valour, and therefore to be\r\nsooner overcome in a treaty than a fight: to this end, the nobles on\r\nboth sides began to have frequent interviews; to make overtures; and at\r\nlast concert the terms of a peace; but wholly to the advantage of the\r\nKing, Robert renouncing his pretensions in consideration of a small\r\npension, and of succeeding to the crown on default of male issue in his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe defection of nobles and other people to the Duke was so great, that\r\nmen generally thought if it had come to a battle, the King would have\r\nlost both the victory and his crown. But Robert, upon his return to\r\nNormandy after this dishonourable peace, grew out of all reputation with\r\nthe world, as well as into perfect hatred and contempt among his own\r\nsubjects, which in a short time was the cause of his ruin.\r\n\r\nThe King having thus by his prudence got rid of a dangerous and\r\ntroublesome rival, and soon after by his valour quelled the\r\ninsurrections of the Earls of Shrewsbury and Mortaigne, whom he forced\r\nto fly into Normandy, found himself in full peace at home and abroad,\r\nand therefore thought he might venture a contention with the Church\r\nabout the right of investing bishops; upon which subject many other\r\nprinces at that time had controversy with their clergy: but, after long\r\nstruggling in vain, were all forced to yield at last to the decree of a\r\nsynod in Rome, and to the pertinacy of the bishops in the several\r\ncountries. The form of investing a bishop, was by delivery of a ring and\r\na pastoral staff; which, at Rome, was declared unlawful to be performed\r\nby any lay hand whatsoever; but the princes of Christendom pleaded\r\nimmemorial custom to authorize them: and King Henry, having given the\r\ninvestiture to certain bishops, commanded Anselm to consecrate them.\r\nThis the archbishop refused with great firmness, pursuant to what he\r\nunderstood to be his duty, and to several immediate commands of the\r\nPope. Both sides adhering to their own sentiments, the matter was\r\ncarried to Rome, where Anselm went in person, by the King's desire; who,\r\nat the same time, sent ambassadors thither to assert and defend his\r\ncause; but the Pope still insisting, Anselm was forbidden to return to\r\nEngland. The King seized on all his revenues, and would not restore him,\r\nuntil upon other concessions of the Pope, Henry was content to yield up\r\nhis pretensions to the investiture; but, however, kept the right of\r\nelecting still in his own hands.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been the method of electing bishops, in the more\r\nprimitive ages, it seems plain to me that in these times, and somewhat\r\nbefore, although the election was made _per clerum et populum_, yet the\r\nking always nominated at first, or approved afterwards, and generally\r\nboth, as may be seen by the style in which their elections ran, as well\r\nas by the persons chosen, who were usually Churchmen of the court, or in\r\nsome employment near the King. But whether this were a gradual\r\nencroachment of the regal upon the spiritual power, I had rather leave\r\nothers to dispute.\r\n\r\n  1104.\r\n  1105.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Duke Robert came to England, upon a visit to the King,\r\nwhere he was received with much kindness and hospitality; but, at the\r\nsame time, the Queen had private directions to manage his easy temper,\r\nand work him to a consent of remitting his pension: this was compassed\r\nwithout much difficulty; but, upon the Duke's return to Normandy, he was\r\nseverely reproved for his weakness by Ralph Bishop of Durham, and the\r\ntwo Earls of Mortaigne and Shrewsbury. These three having fled from\r\nEngland for rebellion, and other treasons, lived exiles in Normandy;\r\nand, bearing an inveterate hatred to the King, resolved to stir up the\r\nDuke to a resentment of the injury and fraud of his brother. Robert, who\r\nwas various in his nature, and always under the power of the present\r\npersuader, easily yielded to their incitements: reproached the King in\r\nbitter terms, by letters and messages, that he had cozened and\r\ncircumvented him; demanding satisfaction, and withal threatening\r\nrevenge. At the same time, by the advice of the three nobles already\r\nmentioned, he began to arm himself as formidably as he could, with\r\ndesign to seize upon the King's possessions in Normandy: but as this\r\nresolution was rashly taken up, so it was as faintly pursued, and ended\r\nin his destruction: neither hath any prince reason to expect better\r\nfortune, that engages in a war against a powerful neighbour upon the\r\ncounsel or instigation of exiles, who having no further view than to\r\nserve their private interest, or gratify their revenge, are sure to\r\nsucceed in one or t'other, if they can embark princes in their quarrel,\r\nwhom they fail not to incite by the falsest representations of their own\r\nstrength, and the weakness of their enemy: for as the King was now\r\nsettled in his throne too firm to be shaken, so Robert had wholly lost\r\nall credit and friendship in England; was sunk in reputation at home;\r\nand, by his unlimited profuseness, reduced so low, that, having pawned\r\nmost of his dominions, he had offered Rouen, his capital city, in sale\r\nto the inhabitants. All this was very well known to the King, who,\r\nresolving to make his advantage thereof, pretended to be highly provoked\r\nat the disgraceful speeches and menaces of his brother; which he made\r\nthe formal occasion of a quarrel: therefore he first sent over some\r\nforces to ravage his country; and, understanding that the Duke was\r\ncoldly supported by his own subjects, many of whom came over to the\r\nKing's army, he soon followed in person with more; took several towns;\r\nand, placing garrisons therein, came back to England, designing with the\r\nfirst pretext or opportunity to return with a more potent army, and\r\nwholly subdue the duchy to his obedience.\r\n\r\nRobert, now grown sensible of his weakness, became wholly dispirited;\r\nand following his brother into England, in a most dejected manner begged\r\nfor peace: but the King, now fully determined upon his ruin, turned away\r\nin disdain, muttering at the same time some threatening words. This\r\nindignity roused up once more the sinking courage of the Duke; who, with\r\nbitter words, detesting the pride and insolence of Henry, withdrew in a\r\nrage, and hasting back to Normandy, made what preparations he could for\r\nhis own defence. The King observing his nobles very ready to engage with\r\nhim in this expedition; and being assured that those in Normandy would,\r\nupon his approach, revolt from the Duke, soon followed with a mighty\r\narmy, and the flower of his kingdom. Upon his arrival he was attended,\r\naccording to his expectation, by several Norman lords; and, with this\r\nformidable force, sat down before Tinchebray: the Duke, accompanied by\r\nthe two exiled earls, advanced with what strength he had, in hopes to\r\ndraw the enemy from the siege of so important a place, although at the\r\nhazard of a battle. Both armies being drawn out in battalia, that of the\r\nKing's, trusting to their numbers, began to charge with great fury, but\r\nwithout any order.\r\n\r\n  1106.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, with forces far inferior, received the enemy with much\r\nfirmness; and, finding they had spent their first heat, advanced very\r\nregularly against their main body, before they could recover themselves\r\nfrom the confusion they were in. He attacked them with so much courage,\r\nthat he broke their whole body, and they began to fly on every side. The\r\nKing believing all was lost, did what he could by threats and gentle\r\nwords to stop the flight of his men, but found it impossible: then he\r\ncommanded two bodies of horse, which were placed on either wing, to\r\njoin, and, wheeling about, to attack the enemy in rear. The Duke, who\r\nthought himself so near a victory, was forced to stop his pursuit; and\r\nordering his men to face about, began the fight anew; mean time the\r\nscattered parts of the main body, which had so lately fled, began to\r\nrally, and pour in upon the Normans behind, by which Duke Robert's army\r\nwas almost encompassed; yet they kept their ground awhile, and made\r\nseveral charges, until at length, perfectly overborne by numbers, they\r\nwere utterly defeated. There Duke Robert, doing all the parts of a great\r\ncaptain, was taken prisoner, together with the Earl of Mortaigne, and\r\nalmost his whole army: for being hemmed in on all sides, few of them\r\ncould make their escape. Thus, in the space of forty years; Normandy\r\nsubdued England, and England Normandy; which are events perhaps hardly\r\nto be paralleled in any other ages or parts of the world.\r\n\r\n  1107.\r\n\r\nThe King, having stayed a while to settle the state of Normandy,\r\nreturned with his brother into England, whom he sent prisoner to Cardiff\r\nCastle, with orders that he should be favourably used, which, for some\r\ntime, were duly observed; until being accused of attempting to make his\r\nescape (whether it were real or feigned) he had his eyes put out with a\r\nburning basin, by the King's express commands; in which miserable\r\ncondition he lived for six-and-twenty years.\r\n\r\nIt is believed the King would hardly have engaged in this unnatural and\r\ninvidious war, with so little pretence or provocation, if the Pope had\r\nnot openly approved and sanctified his cause, exhorting him to it as a\r\nmeritorious action; which seems to have been but an ill return from the\r\nVicar of CHRIST to a prince who had performed so many brave exploits for\r\nthe service of the Church, to the hazard of his person, and ruin of his\r\nfortune. But the very bigoted monks, who have left us their accounts of\r\nthose times, do generally agree in heavily taxing the Roman court for\r\nbribery and corruption. And the King had promised to remit his right of\r\ninvesting bishops, which he performed immediately after his reduction of\r\nNormandy, and was a matter of much more service to the Pope, than all\r\nthe achievements of Duke Robert in the Holy Land, whose merits, as well\r\nas pretensions, were now antiquated and out of date.\r\n\r\n  1109.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Emperor Henry V. sent to desire Maud, the King's\r\ndaughter in marriage, who was then a child about eight years old: that\r\nprince had lately been embroiled in a quarrel with the see of Rome,\r\nwhich began upon the same subject of investing bishops, but was carried\r\nto great extremities: for invading Italy with a mighty army, he took the\r\nPope prisoner, forced him to yield to whatever terms he thought fit to\r\nimpose, and to take an oath of fidelity to him between his hands:\r\nhowever, as soon as Henry had withdrawn his forces, the Pope assembling\r\na council, revoked all his concessions, as extorted by compulsion, and\r\nraised great troubles in Germany against the Emperor, who, in order to\r\nsecure himself, sought this alliance with the King.\r\n\r\nAbout this time likewise died Archbishop Anselm, a prelate of great\r\npiety and learning, whose zeal for the see of Rome, as well as for his\r\nown rights and privileges, should in justice be imputed to the errors of\r\nthe time, and not of the man. After his death, the King, following the\r\nsteps of his brother, held the see vacant five years, contenting himself\r\nwith an excuse, which looked like a jest, That he only waited until he\r\ncould find another so good a man as Anselm.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth year of this King's reign, the Welsh, after their\r\nusual manner, invaded the Marches with great fury and destruction; but\r\nthe King, hoping to put a final end to those perpetual troubles and\r\nvexations given to his kingdom by that unquiet people, went in person\r\nagainst them with a powerful army; and to prevent their usual stratagem\r\nof retreating to their woods and mountains, and other fastnesses, he\r\nordered the woods to be cut down, beset all their places of security,\r\nand hunting them like wild beasts, made so terrible a slaughter, that at\r\nlength observing them to fling down their arms, and beg for quarter, he\r\ncommanded his soldiers to forbear; then receiving their submissions, and\r\nplacing garrisons where he thought necessary, he returned, in great\r\ntriumph and satisfaction, to London.\r\n\r\n  1114.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Maud being now marriageable, was delivered to the Emperor's\r\nambassador; and for a portion to the young lady a tax was imposed of\r\nthree shillings upon every hide of land in England, which grew\r\nafterwards into a custom,[19] and was in succeeding times confirmed by\r\nActs of Parliament, under the name of \"Reasonable Aid for marrying the\r\nKing's Daughter,\" although levied after a different manner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: This was the first occasion of the feudal tax called\r\nscutage being levied in England. [W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nAs the institution of Parliaments in England is agreed by several\r\nwriters to be owing to this King, so the date of the first hath been\r\nassigned by some to the fifteenth year of his reign; which however is\r\nnot to be affirmed with any certainty: for great councils were convoked\r\nnot only in the two preceding reigns, but for time immemorial by the\r\nSaxon princes, who first introduced them into this island, from the same\r\noriginal with the other Gothic forms of government in most parts of\r\nEurope. These councils or assemblies were composed according to the\r\npleasure of the prince who convened them, generally of nobles and\r\nbishops, sometimes were added some considerable commoners; but they\r\nseldom met, except in the beginning of a reign, or in times of war,\r\nuntil this King came to the crown; who being a wise and popular prince,\r\ncalled these great assemblies upon most important affairs of his reign,\r\nand ever followed their advice, which, if it proved successful, the\r\nhonour and advantage redounded to him, and if otherwise, he was free\r\nfrom the blame: thus when he chose a wife for himself, and a husband for\r\nhis daughter, when he designed his expedition against Robert, and even\r\nfor the election of an archbishop to the see of Canterbury, he proceeded\r\nwholly by the advice of such general assemblies, summoned for the\r\npurpose. But the style of these conventions, as delivered by several\r\nauthors, is very various; sometimes it is _comites, barones, et\r\ncleri_;[20] his marriage was agreed on, _consilio majorum natu et\r\nmagnatum terrae_. One author[21] calls it _concilium principum,\r\nsacerdotum, et reliqui populi._ And for the election of an archbishop,\r\nthe Saxon Chronicle says, That he commanded by letters all bishops,\r\nabbots, and thanes to meet him at Gloucester _ad procerum conventum_.\r\nLastly, some affirm these assemblies to have been an imitation of the\r\nthree estates in Normandy. I am very sensible how much time and pains\r\nhave been employed by several learned men to search out the original of\r\nParliaments in England, wherein I doubt they have little satisfied\r\nothers or themselves. I know likewise that to engage in the same\r\nenquiry, would neither suit my abilities nor my subject. It may be\r\nsufficient for my purpose, if I be able to give some little light into\r\nthis matter, for the curiosity of those who are less informed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Brompton. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Polydore Virgil. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe institution of a state or commonwealth out of a mixture of the three\r\nforms of government received in the schools, however it be derided as a\r\nsolecism and absurdity by some late writers on politics, hath been very\r\nancient in the world, and is celebrated by the gravest authors of\r\nantiquity. For although the supreme power cannot properly be said to be\r\ndivided, yet it may be so placed in three several hands, as each to be a\r\ncheck upon the other; or formed into a balance, which is held by him\r\nthat has the executive power, with the nobility and people in\r\ncounterpoise in each scale. Thus the kingdom of Media is represented by\r\nXenophon before the reign of Cyrus; so Polybius tells us, the best\r\ngovernment is a mixture of the three forms, _regno, optimatium, et\r\npopuli imperio_: the same was that of Sparta in its primitive\r\ninstitution by Lycurgus, made up of _reges, seniores, et populus_; the\r\nlike may be asserted of Rome, Carthage, and other states: and the\r\nGermans of old fell upon the same model, from whence the Goths their\r\nneighbours, with the rest of those northern people, did perhaps borrow\r\nit. But an assembly of the three estates is not properly of Gothic\r\ninstitution: for these fierce people, when upon the decline of the Roman\r\nEmpire they first invaded Europe, and settled so many kingdoms in Italy,\r\nSpain, and other parts, were all Heathens; and when a body of them had\r\nfixed themselves in a tract of land left desolate by the flight or\r\ndestruction of the natives, their military government by time and peace\r\nbecame civil; the general was king, his great officers were his nobles\r\nand ministers of state, and the common soldiers the body of the people;\r\nbut these were freemen, and had smaller portions of land assigned them.\r\nThe remaining natives were all slaves; the nobles were a standing\r\ncouncil; and upon affairs of great importance, the freemen were likewise\r\ncalled by their representatives to give their advice. By which it\r\nappears, that the Gothic frame of government consisted at first but of\r\ntwo states or assemblies, under the administration of a single person.\r\nBut after the conversion of these princes and their people to the\r\nChristian faith, the Church became endowed with great possessions, as\r\nwell by the bounty of kings, as the arts and industry of the clergy,\r\nwinning upon the devotion of their new converts: and power, by the\r\ncommon maxim, always accompanying property, the ecclesiastics began soon\r\nto grow considerable, to form themselves into a body, and to call\r\nassemblies or synods by their own authority, or sometimes by the command\r\nof their princes, who in an ignorant age had a mighty veneration for\r\ntheir learning as well as piety. By such degrees the Church arrived at\r\nlength, by very justifiable steps, to have her share in the\r\ncommonwealth, and became a third estate in most kingdoms of Europe; but\r\nthese assemblies, as we have already observed, were seldom called in\r\nEngland before the reign of this prince, nor even then were always\r\ncomposed after the same manner: neither does it appear from the writers\r\nwho lived nearest to that age, that the people had any representative at\r\nall, beside the barons and other nobles, who did not sit in those\r\nassemblies by virtue of their birth or creation, but of the lands or\r\nbaronies they held. So that the present constitution of the English\r\nParliament hath, by many degrees and alterations, been modelled to the\r\nframe it is now in; which alterations I shall observe in the succeeding\r\nreigns as exactly as I can discover them by a diligent search into the\r\nhistories of the several ages, without engaging in the controverted\r\npoints of law about this matter, which would rather perplex the reader\r\nthan inform him.\r\n\r\n  1116.\r\n\r\nBut to return, Louis the Gross King of France, a valiant and active\r\nprince, in the flower of his age, succeeding to that crown that Robert\r\nwas deprived of, Normandy, grew jealous of the neighbourhood and power\r\nof King Henry, and begun early to entertain designs either of subduing\r\nthat duchy to himself, or at least of making a considerable party\r\nagainst the King in favour of William son of Robert, whom for that end\r\nhe had taken into his protection. Pursuant to these intentions, he soon\r\nfound an occasion for a quarrel: expostulating with Henry, that he had\r\nbroken his promise by not doing homage for the Duchy of Normandy, as\r\nwell as by neglecting to raze the castle of Gisors,[22] which was built\r\non the French side of the river Epte, the common boundary between both\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Father Daniel says that for some years past it had been\r\nagreed that Gisors \"should be sequestered in the hands of a lord called\r\nPagan or Payen, who was to receive into it neither English or Norman,\r\nnor French troops; and in case it should fall into the hands of either\r\nof the two kings, it was stipulated, that the walls should be razed\r\nwithin the space of forty days\" (\"Hist. of France,\" i. 369). [W.S.J.]\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut an incident soon offered, which gave King Henry a pretext for\r\nretaliating almost in the same manner: for it happened that upon some\r\noffence taken against his nephew Theobald Count of Blois by the French\r\nKing, Louis in great rage sent an army to invade and ravage the earl's\r\nterritories. Theobald defended himself for a while with much valour; but\r\nat length in danger to be overpowered, requested aid of his uncle the\r\nKing of England, who supported him so effectually with men and money,\r\nthat he was able not only to defend his own country, but very much to\r\ninfest and annoy his enemy. Thus a war was kindled between the two\r\nkings; Louis now openly asserted the title of William the son of Robert,\r\nand entering into an alliance with the Earls of Flanders and Anjou,\r\nbegan to concert measures for driving King Henry out of Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe King having timely intelligence of his enemy's designs, began with\r\ngreat vigour and dispatch to prepare himself for war: he raised, with\r\nmuch difficulty and discontent of his people, the greatest tax that had\r\never been known in England; and passing over into Normandy with a mighty\r\narmy, joined his nephew Theobald. The King of France, who had\r\nentertained hopes that he should overrun the duchy before his enemy\r\ncould arrive, advanced with great security towards the frontiers of\r\nNormandy; but observing an enemy of equal number and force already\r\nprepared to engage him, he suddenly stopped his march. The two armies\r\nfaced one another for some hours, neither side offering battle; the rest\r\nof the day was spent in light skirmishes begun by the French, and\r\nrepeated for some days following with various success; but the remainder\r\nof the year passed without any considerable action.\r\n\r\n  1119.\r\n\r\nAt length the violence of the two princes brought it to a battle: for\r\nLouis, to give a reputation to his arms, advanced towards the frontiers\r\nof Normandy, and after a short siege took Gué Nicaise;[23] there the\r\nKing met him, and the fight began, which continued with great obstinacy\r\non both sides for nine hours. The French army was divided into two\r\nbodies, and the English into three; by which means, that part where the\r\nKing fought in person, being attacked by a superior number, began to\r\ngive way; and William Crispin, a Norman baron, singling out the King of\r\nEngland (whose subject he had been, but banished for treason) struck him\r\ntwice in the head with so much violence, that the blood gushed out of\r\nhis mouth. The King inflamed with rage and indignation, dealt such\r\nfurious blows, that he struck down several of his enemies, and Crispin\r\namong the rest, who was taken prisoner at his horse's feet. The soldiers\r\nencouraged by the valour of their prince, rallied and fell on with fresh\r\nvigour, and the victory seemed doubtful, when William the son of King\r\nHenry, to whom his father had entrusted the third body of his army,\r\nwhich had not yet engaged, fell on with this fresh reserve upon the\r\nenemy, who was already very much harassed with the toil of the day: this\r\nquickly decided the matter; for the French, though valiantly fighting,\r\nwere overcome, with the slaughter of several thousand men; their King\r\nquitted the field, and withdrew to Andely; but the King of England\r\nrecovering Gué Nicaise, returned triumphant to Rouen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: At that time reckoned an important fortress on the river\r\nEpte. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis important victory was followed by the defection of the Earl of\r\nAnjou to King Henry, and the Earl of Flanders fell in the battle; by\r\nwhich the King of France was at once deprived of two powerful allies.\r\nHowever, by the intercession of the former, a peace was soon after made\r\nbetween both crowns. William the King's son did homage to Louis for the\r\nDukedom of Normandy; and the other William, following the fortunes of\r\nhis father, was left to his pretensions and complaints.\r\n\r\nIt is here observable, that from this time until Wales was subdued to\r\nthe English crown, the eldest sons of England were called Dukes of\r\nNormandy, as they are now Princes of Wales.\r\n\r\n  1120.\r\n\r\nThe King having stayed some time in Normandy, for the settlement of his\r\nduchy after the calamities and confusions of a war, returned to England,\r\nto the very great satisfaction of his people and himself. He had\r\nenlarged his dominions by the conquest of Normandy; he had subdued all\r\nhis competitors, and forced even the King of France, their great\r\nprotector, after a glorious victory, to his own conditions of a peace;\r\nhe was upon very good terms with the Pope, who had a great esteem and\r\nfriendship for his person, and made him larger concessions than was\r\nusual from that see, and in those ages. At home he was respected by the\r\nclergy, reverenced by the nobles, and beloved by the people; in his\r\nfamily he was blessed with a son of much hopes, just growing to years of\r\nmanhood, and his daughter was an empress; so that he seemed to possess\r\nas great a share of happiness as human life is capable to admit. But the\r\nfelicity of man depends upon a conjunction of many circumstances, which\r\nare all subject to various accidents, and every single accident is able\r\nto dissolve the whole contexture; which truth was never verified more\r\nthan in this prince, who by one domestic misfortune, not to be prevented\r\nor foreseen, found all the pleasure and content he proposed to himself\r\nby his prudence, his industry, and his valour, wholly disappointed and\r\ndestroyed: for William the young prince having embarked at Barfleur some\r\ntime after his father, the mariners being all drunk, suffered the ship\r\nto run upon a rock, where it was dashed to pieces: the prince made a\r\nshift to get into the boat, and was making to the shore, until forced\r\nback by the cries of his sister, whom he received into the boat, so many\r\nothers crowded in at the same time, that it was immediately overturned.\r\nThere perished, beside the prince, a natural son and daughter of the\r\nKing's, his niece, and many other persons of quality, together with all\r\ntheir attendants and servants, to the number of a hundred and forty,\r\nbeside fifty mariners, but one person escaping.\r\n\r\nAlthough the King survived this cruel misfortune many years, yet he\r\ncould never recover his former humour, but grew melancholy and morose;\r\nhowever, in order to provide better for the peace and settlement of the\r\nkingdom after his death, about five months after the loss of his son,\r\nhis former Queen having died three years before, he married Adeliza, a\r\nbeautiful young lady of the family of Lorraine,[24] in hopes of issue by\r\nher, but never had any.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: She was daughter of Godfrey Duke of Louvain, or the Lower\r\nLorraine. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n  1124.\r\n\r\nThe death of the prince gave occasion to some new troubles in Normandy;\r\nfor the Earls of Meulant and Evreux, Hugh de Montfort, and other\r\nassociates, began to raise insurrections there, which were thought to be\r\nprivately fomented by the French King, out of enmity to King Henry, and\r\nin favour of William the son of Robert, to whom the Earl of Anjou had\r\nlately given his daughter in marriage. But William of Tankerville, the\r\nKing's lieutenant in Normandy, surprising the enemy's forces by an\r\nambush, entirely routed them, took both the earls prisoners, and sent\r\none of them (Meulant) to his master; but the Count d'Evreux made his\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n  1126.\r\n\r\nKing Henry having now lost hope of issue by his new Queen, brought with\r\nhim, on his return to England, his daughter Maud, who by the Emperor's\r\ndeath had been lately left a widow and childless; and in a Parliament or\r\ngeneral assembly which he had summoned at Windsor, he caused the crown\r\nto be settled on her and her children, and made all his nobles take a\r\nsolemn oath to defend her title. This was performed by none with so much\r\nforwardness as Stephen Earl of Boulogne, who was observed to shew a more\r\nthan ordinary zeal in the matter. This young lord was the King's nephew,\r\nbeing second son of the Earl of Blois by Adela the Conqueror's daughter:\r\nhe was in high favour with the King his uncle, who had married him to\r\nthe daughter and heiress of the Earl of Boulogne, given him great\r\npossessions in England, and made him indeed too powerful for a subject.\r\n\r\nThe King having thus fixed the succession of the crown in his daughter\r\nby an Act of Settlement and an oath of fealty, looked about to provide\r\nher with a second husband, and at length determined his choice in\r\nGeoffrey Plantagenet Earl of Anjou, the son of Fulk lately deceased.\r\n\r\nThis prince, whose dominions confined on France and Normandy, was\r\nusually courted for an ally by both Kings in their several quarrels; but\r\nhaving little faith or honour, he never scrupled to change sides as\r\noften as he saw or conceived it for his advantage. After the great\r\nvictory over the French, he closed in with King Henry, and gave his\r\ndaughter to the young prince William; yet at the same time, by the\r\nprivate encouragement of Louis, he prevailed on the King of England to\r\nbe easy in the conditions of a peace. Upon the unfortunate loss of the\r\nprince, and the troubles in Normandy thereupon, he fell again from the\r\nKing, gave his other daughter to William the son of Robert, and struck\r\nup with France to take that prince again into protection. But dying soon\r\nafter, and leaving his son Geoffrey to succeed in that earldom, the King\r\nwas of opinion he could not anywhere bestow his daughter with more\r\nadvantage, both for the security and enlargement of his dominions, than\r\nby giving her to this earl; by which marriage Anjou would become an\r\nacquisition to Normandy, and this be a more equal match to so formidable\r\na neighbour as France. In a short time the marriage was concluded; and\r\nthis Earl Geoffrey had the honour to introduce into the royal family of\r\nEngland the surname of Plantagenet, borne by so many succeeding Kings,\r\nwhich began with Henry II. who was the eldest son of this marriage.\r\n\r\nBut the King of France was in great discontent at this match: he easily\r\nforesaw the dismal consequences to himself and his successors from such\r\nan increase of dominion united to the crown of England: he knew what\r\nimpressions might be made in future times to the shaking of his throne\r\nby an aspiring and warlike king, if they should happen in a weak reign,\r\nor upon any great discontents in that kingdom. Which conjectures being\r\nhighly reasonable (and since often verified by events) he cast about to\r\nfind some way of driving the King of England entirely out of France; but\r\nhaving neither pretext nor stomach in the midst of a peace to begin an\r\nopen and formal quarrel, there fell out an accident which gave him\r\nplausible occasion of pursuing his design.\r\n\r\nCharles the Good Earl of Flanders having been lately murdered by some of\r\nhis subjects, upon private revenge, the King of France went in person to\r\ntake revenge of the assassins; which he performed with great justice and\r\nhonour. But the late earl leaving no heir of his body, and several\r\ncompetitors appearing to dispute the succession, Louis rejected some\r\nothers who seemed to have a fairer title, and adjudged it to William the\r\nson of Robert, the better to secure him to his interests upon any design\r\nhe might engage in against the King of England. Not content with this,\r\nhe assisted the Earl in person, subdued his rivals, and left him in\r\npeaceable possession of his new dominion.\r\n\r\nKing Henry, on the other side, was very apprehensive of his nephew's\r\ngreatness, well knowing to what end it was directed; however, he seemed\r\nnot to regard it, contenting himself to give the Earl employment at home\r\nby privately nourishing the discontents of his new subjects, and\r\nabetting underhand another pretender: for William had so entirely lost\r\nthe hearts of his people, by his intolerable avarice and exactions, that\r\nthe principal towns in Flanders revolted from him, and invited Thierri\r\nEarl of Alsace to be their governor. But the King of France generously\r\nresolved to appear once more in his defence, and took his third\r\nexpedition into Flanders for that purpose. He had marched as far as\r\nArtois, when he was suddenly recalled to defend his own dominions from\r\nthe fury of a powerful and provoked invader: for Henry King of England,\r\nmoved with indignation to see the French King in the midst of a peace so\r\nfrequently and openly supporting his most dangerous enemy, thought it\r\nthe best way to divert Louis from kindling a fire against him abroad, by\r\nforcing him to extinguish one at home: he therefore entered into the\r\nbowels of France, ravaging and laying waste all before him, and quickly\r\ngrew so formidable, that the French King to purchase a peace was forced\r\nto promise never more to assist or favour the Earl of Flanders; however,\r\nas it fell out, this article proved to be wholly needless; for the young\r\nEarl soon after gave battle to Thierri, and put his whole army to the\r\nrout; but pursuing his victory, he received a wound in his wrist, which,\r\nby the unskilfulness of a surgeon, cost him his life.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The lance passed through or under the ball of his thumb\r\ninto his wrist. The wound gangrening, he died within five days. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis one slight inconsiderable accident did, in all probability, put a\r\nstop to very great events; for if that young prince had survived his\r\nvictory, it is hardly to be doubted but through the justness of his\r\ncause, the reputation of his valour, and the assistance of the King of\r\nFrance, he would in a little time have recovered Normandy, and perhaps\r\nhis father's liberty, which were the two designs he had in agitation;\r\nnor could he well have missed the crown of England after the King's\r\ndeath, who was now in his decline, when he had so fair a title, and no\r\ncompetitors in view but a woman and an infant.\r\n\r\n  1129.\r\n\r\nUpon the King's return from Normandy, a great council of the clergy was\r\nheld at London, for the punishing of priests who lived in concubinage,\r\nwhich was the great grievance of the Church in those ages, and had been\r\ncondemned by several canons. This assembly thinking to take a more\r\neffectual course against that abomination, as it was called, decreed\r\nsevere penalties upon those who should be guilty of breaking it,\r\nentreating the King to see the law put in execution; which he very\r\nreadily undertook, but performed otherwise than was expected, eluding\r\nthe force of the law by an evasion to his own advantage: for exacting\r\nfines of the delinquent priests, he suffered them to keep their\r\nconcubines without further disturbance. A very unaccountable step in so\r\nwise a body for their own concernments, as the clergy of those times is\r\nlooked upon to have been; and although perhaps the fact be not worth\r\nrecording, it may serve as a lesson to all assemblies never to trust the\r\nexecution of a law in the hands of those who will find it more to their\r\ninterests to see it broken than observed.\r\n\r\n  1132.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Maud was now happily delivered of a son, who was afterwards\r\nKing of England by the name of Henry the Second: and the King calling a\r\nParliament, had the oath of fealty repeated by the nobles and clergy to\r\nher and her issue, which in the compass of three years they all broke or\r\nforgot.\r\n\r\n  1134.\r\n\r\nI think it may deserve a place in this history to mention the last scene\r\nof Duke Robert's life, who, either through the poorness or greatness of\r\nspirit, having outlived the loss of his honour, his dominions, his\r\nliberty, his eyesight, and his only son, was at last forced to sink\r\nunder the load of eighty years, and must be allowed for the greatest\r\nexample either of insensibility or contempt of earthly things, that ever\r\nappeared in a sovereign or private person. He was a prince hardly\r\nequalled by any in his time for valour, conduct, and courtesy; but his\r\nruin began from the easiness of his nature, which whoever knew how to\r\nmanage, were sure to be refused nothing they could ask. By such\r\nprofusion he was reduced to those unhappy expedients of remitting his\r\nrights for a pension, of pawning his towns, and multiplying taxes, which\r\nbrought him into hatred and contempt with his subjects; neither do I\r\nthink any virtue so little commendable in a sovereign as that of\r\nliberality, where it exceeds what his ordinary revenues can supply;\r\nwhere it passes those bounds, his subjects must all be oppressed to shew\r\nhis bounty to a few flatterers, or he must sell his towns, or basely\r\nrenounce his rights, by becoming pensioner to some powerful prince in\r\nthe neighbourhood; all which we have lived to see performed by a late\r\nmonarch in our own time and country.\r\n\r\n  1135.\r\n\r\nSince the reduction of Normandy to the King's obedience, he found it\r\nnecessary for his affairs to spend in that duchy some part of his time\r\nalmost every year, and a little before the death of Robert he made his\r\nlast voyage there. It was observable in this prince, that having some\r\nyears past very narrowly escaped shipwreck in his passage from Normandy\r\ninto England, the sense of his danger had made very deep impressions on\r\nhis mind, which he discovered by a great reformation in his life, by\r\nredressing several grievances, and doing many acts of piety; and to shew\r\nthe steadiness of his resolutions, he kept them to the last, making a\r\nprogress through most parts of Normandy, treating his subjects in all\r\nplaces with great familiarity and kindness, granting their petitions,\r\neasing their taxes, and, in a word, giving all possible marks of a\r\nreligious, wise, and gracious prince.\r\n\r\nReturning to St. Denys le Ferment from his progress a little indisposed,\r\nhe there fell into a fever upon a surfeit of lamprey, which in a few\r\ndays ended his life. His body was conveyed to England, and buried at\r\nReading in the abbey-church himself had founded.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to affirm anything peculiar of this prince's character; those\r\nauthors who have attempted it mentioning very little but what was common\r\nto him with thousands of other men; neither have they recorded any of\r\nthose personal circumstances or passages, which only can discover such\r\nqualities of the mind as most distinguish one man from another. These\r\ndefects may perhaps appear in the stories of many succeeding kings;\r\nwhich makes me hope I shall not be altogether blamed for sometimes\r\ndisappointing the reader in a point wherein I could wish to be the most\r\nexact.\r\n\r\nAs to his person, he is described to be of middle stature; his body\r\nstrong set and fleshy; his hair black; his eyes large; his countenance\r\namiable, and very pleasant, especially when he was merry. He was\r\ntemperate in meat and drink, and a hater of effeminacy, a vice or folly\r\nmuch complained of in his time, especially that circumstance of long\r\nartificial hair, which he forbade upon severe penalties. His three\r\nprincipal virtues were prudence, valour, and eloquence. These were\r\ncounterbalanced by three great vices; avarice, cruelty, and lust; of\r\nwhich the first is proved by the frequency of his taxes; the second by\r\nhis treatment of Duke Robert; and the last was notorious. But the proof\r\nof his virtues doth not depend on single instances, manifesting\r\nthemselves through the whole course of a long reign, which was hardly\r\nattended by any misfortune that prudence, justice, or valour could\r\nprevent. He came to the crown at a ripe age, when he had passed thirty\r\nyears, having learned, in his private life, to struggle with hardships,\r\nwhereof he had his share, from the capriciousness and injustice of both\r\nhis brothers; and by observing their failures, he had learned to avoid\r\nthem in himself, being steady and uniform in his whole conduct, which\r\nwere qualities they both seemed chiefly to want. This likewise made him\r\nso very tenacious as he was observed to be in his love and hatred. He\r\nwas a strict observer of justice, which he seems never to have violated,\r\nbut in that particular case, which political casuists are pleased to\r\ndispense with, where the dispute is about a crown. In that he[25] * * *\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Here the sentence breaks off short, and is left\r\nunfinished. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nConsider him as a private man, he was perhaps the most accomplished\r\nperson of his age, having a facetious wit, cultivated by learning, and\r\nadvanced with a great share of natural eloquence, which was his peculiar\r\ntalent: and it was no doubt the sense he had of this last perfection in\r\nhimself, that put him so often upon calling together the great councils\r\nof the nation, where natural oratory is of most figure as well as use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF STEPHEN.\r\n\r\nThe veneration which people are supposed naturally to pay to a right\r\nline, and a lawful title in their kings, must be upheld by a long\r\nuninterrupted succession, otherwise it quickly loses opinion, upon which\r\nthe strength of it, although not the justice, is entirely founded: and\r\nwhere breaches have been already made in the lineal descent, there is\r\nlittle security in a good title (though confirmed by promises and oaths)\r\nwhere the lawful heir is absent, and a popular aspiring pretender near\r\nat hand. This, I think, may pass for a maxim, if any consequences drawn\r\nfrom history can pretend to be called so, having been verified\r\nsuccessively three times in this kingdom, I mean by the two preceding\r\nkings, and by the prince whose reign we are now writing. Neither can\r\nthis observation be justly controlled by any instances brought of future\r\nprinces, who being absent at their predecessor's death, have peaceably\r\nsucceeded, the circumstances being very different in every case, either\r\nby the weakness or justice of pretenders, or else by the long\r\nestablishment of lineal succession.\r\n\r\n  1135.\r\n\r\nStephen Earl of Boulogne, whose descent hath been already shewn in the\r\nforegoing reign, was the second of three brothers, whereof the eldest\r\nwas Theobald Earl of Blois, a sovereign prince, and Henry the youngest\r\nwas Bishop of Winchester, and the Pope's legate in England. At the time\r\nof King Henry's death, his daughter the Empress was with her husband the\r\nEarl of Anjou, a grave and cautious prince, altogether unqualified for\r\nsudden enterprises: but Earl Stephen, who had attended the King in his\r\nlast expedition, made so great dispatch for England,[26] that the\r\ncouncil had not time to meet and make any declaration about a successor.\r\nWhen the lords were assembled, the legate had already, by his credit and\r\ninfluence among them, brought over a great party to his brother's\r\ninterests; and the Earl himself, knowing with what success the like\r\nmethods were used by his two last predecessors, was very liberal of his\r\npromises to amend the laws, support the Church, and redress grievances:\r\nfor all which the bishop undertook to be guarantee. And thus was Stephen\r\nelected by those very persons who had so lately, and in so solemn a\r\nmanner, more than once sworn fealty to another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Stephen was at Boulogne when he received the news of\r\nHenry's death. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe motives whereby the nobility was swayed to proceed after this\r\nmanner, were obvious enough. There had been a perpetual struggle between\r\nthem and their former kings in the defence of their liberties; for the\r\nsecurity whereof, they thought a king elected without other title, would\r\nbe readier to enter into any obligations, and being held in constant\r\ndependence, would be less tempted to break them: therefore, as at his\r\ncoronation they obtained full security by his taking new and additional\r\noaths in favour of their liberties, their oath of fealty to him was but\r\nconditional, to be of force no longer than he should be true to those\r\nstipulations.\r\n\r\nBut other reasons were contrived and given out to satisfy the people:\r\nthey were told it was an indignity for so noble a nation to be governed\r\nby a woman; that the late King had promised to marry his daughter within\r\nthe realm, and by consent of Parliament, neither of which was observed:\r\nand lastly, Hugh Bigod, steward to King Henry, took a voluntary oath,\r\nbefore the Archbishop of Canterbury, that his master, in his last\r\nsickness, had, upon some displeasure, disinherited his daughter.\r\n\r\nHe received the crown with one great advantage that could best enable\r\nhim to preserve it: this was the possession of his uncle's treasures,\r\namounting to one hundred thousand pounds, and reckoned as a prodigious\r\nsum in those days; by the help of which, without ever raising one tax\r\nupon the people, he defended an unjust title against the lawful heir\r\nduring a perpetual contest of almost twenty years.\r\n\r\nIn order to defend himself against any sudden invasion, which he had\r\ncause enough to expect, he gave all men licence to build castles upon\r\ntheir lands, which proved a very mistaken piece of politics, although\r\ngrounded upon some appearance of reason. The King supposed that no\r\ninvader would venture to advance into the heart of his country without\r\nreducing every castle in his way, which must be a work of much time and\r\ndifficulty, nor would be able to afford men to block them up, and secure\r\nhis retreat: which way of arguing may be good enough to a prince of an\r\nundisputed title, and entirely in the hearts of his subjects: but\r\nnumerous castles are ill defenders of an usurpation, being the common\r\nretreat of malcontents, where they can fly with security, and discover\r\ntheir affections as they please: by which means the enemy, although\r\nbeaten in the field, may still preserve his footing in the bowels of a\r\ncountry; may wait supplies from abroad; and prolong a war for many\r\nyears: nor, while he is master of any castles, can he ever be at mercy\r\nby any sudden misfortune; but may be always in a condition of demanding\r\nterms for himself. These, and many other effects of so pernicious a\r\ncounsel, the King found through the whole course of his reign; which was\r\nentirely spent in sieges, revolts, surprises, and surrenders, with very\r\nfew battles, but no decisive action: a period of much misery and\r\nconfusion, which affords little that is memorable for events, or useful\r\nfor the instruction of posterity.\r\n\r\n  1136.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable enemy that appeared against him was David King of\r\nScots, who having taken the oath of fealty to Maud and her issue, being\r\nfurther engaged by the ties of blood, and stirred up through the\r\npersuasions of several English nobles, began to take up arms in her\r\ncause; and invading the northern parts, took Carlisle and Newcastle; but\r\nupon the King's speedy approach with his forces, a peace was presently\r\nmade, and the towns restored. However, the Scottish prince would, by no\r\nmeans, renounce his fidelity to the Empress, by paying homage to\r\nStephen; so that an expedient was found to have it performed by his\r\neldest son: in consideration of which the King gave, or rather restored,\r\nto him the Earldom of Huntingdon.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to London from this expedition, he happened to fall sick\r\nof a lethargy, and it was confidently given out that he was dead. This\r\nreport was, with great industry and artifice, dispersed by his enemies,\r\nwhich quickly discovered the ill inclination of several lords, who,\r\nalthough they never believed the thing, yet made use of it for an\r\noccasion or pretext to fortify their castles, which they refused to\r\nsurrender to the King himself; but Stephen was resolved, as he said, to\r\nconvince them that he was alive and well; for coming against them before\r\nhe was expected, he recovered Exeter, Norwich,[27] and other fortified\r\nplaces, although not without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Hugh Bigod had seized Norwich Castle. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious enough to wonder how a prince of so much valour, and other\r\nexcellent endowments, elected by the Church and State, after a\r\ncompliance with all conditions they could impose on him, and in an age\r\nwhen so little regard was had to the lineal descent, lastly confirmed by\r\nthe Pope himself, should be soon deserted and opposed by those very\r\npersons who had been the most instrumental to promote him. But, beside\r\nhis defective title, and the undistinguished liberty of building\r\ncastles, there were three circumstances which very much contributed to\r\nthose perpetual revolts of the nobles against him: first, that upon his\r\ncoming to the crown he was very liberal in distributing lands and\r\nhonours to several young gentlemen of noble birth, who came to make\r\ntheir court, whereby he hoped to get the reputation of a generous\r\nprince, and to strengthen his party against the Empress: but, by this\r\nencouragement, the number of pretenders quickly grew too fast upon him;\r\nand when he had granted all he was able, he was forced to dismiss the\r\nrest with promises and excuses, who, either out of envy or discontent,\r\nor else to mend their fortunes, never failed to become his enemies upon\r\nthe first occasion that offered. Secondly, when he had reduced several\r\ncastles and towns which had given the first example of disaffection from\r\nhim, he hardly inflicted the least punishment on the authors; which\r\nunseasonable mercy, that in another prince and another age would have\r\nbeen called greatness of spirit, passed in him for pusillanimity and\r\nfear, and is reckoned, by the writers of those times to have been the\r\ncause of many succeeding revolts. The third circumstance was of a\r\ndifferent kind: for, observing how little good effect he had found by\r\nhis liberality and indulgence, he would needs try the other extreme,\r\nwhich was not his talent. He began to infringe the articles of his\r\ncharter; to recall or disown the promises he had made; and to repulse\r\npetitioners with rough treatment, which was the more unacceptable by\r\nbeing new and unexpected.\r\n\r\n  1137.\r\n\r\nMean time the Earl of Anjou, who was not in a condition to assert his\r\nwife's title to England, hearing Stephen was employed at home, entered\r\nNormandy with small force, and found it no difficult matter to seize\r\nseveral towns. The Normans, in the present distraction of affairs, not\r\nwell knowing what prince to obey, at last sent an invitation to Theobald\r\nEarl of Blois, King Stephen's eldest brother, to accept their dukedom\r\nupon the condition of protecting them from the present insults of the\r\nEarl of Anjou. But before this matter could come to an issue, Stephen,\r\nwho, upon reduction of the towns already mentioned, had found a short\r\ninterval of quiet from his English subjects, arrived with unexpected\r\nspeed into Normandy; where Geoffrey of Anjou soon fled before him, and\r\nthe whole duchy came over to his obedience; for the further settlement\r\nwhereof he made peace with the King of France; constituted his son\r\nEustace Duke of Normandy; and made him swear fealty to that Prince, and\r\ndo him homage. His brother Theobald, who began to expostulate upon this\r\ndisappointment, he pacified with a pension of two thousand marks:[28]\r\nand even the Earl of Anjou himself, who, in right of his wife, made\r\ndemands of Stephen for the kingdom of England, finding he was no equal\r\nmatch at present, was persuaded to become his pensioner for five\r\nthousand more.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: The mark of Normandy is to be understood here. Such a\r\npension in that age was equivalent to one of £31,000 sterling in the\r\npresent. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Five thousand marks of silver coin was, in this reign, of\r\nthe same value as the sum of £77,500 modern currency, is now. Here again\r\nthe Norman mark seems to be used. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nStephen, upon his return to England, met with an account of new troubles\r\nfrom the north; for the King of Scots, under pretence of observing his\r\noath of fealty to the Empress, infested the Borders, and frequently\r\nmaking cruel inroads, plundered and laid waste all before him.\r\n\r\n  1138.\r\n\r\nIn order to revenge this base and perfidious treatment, the King, in his\r\nmarch northward, sat down before Bedford, and took it after a siege of\r\ntwenty days. This town was part of the Earldom of Huntingdon, given by\r\nStephen in the late peace to the eldest son of the Scottish King, for\r\nwhich the young prince did homage to him; and it was upon that account\r\ndefended by a garrison of Scots. Upon intelligence of this surrender,\r\nKing David, overcome with fury, entered Northumberland, where, letting\r\nloose the rage of his soldiers, he permitted and encouraged them to\r\ncommit all manner of inhumanities; which they performed in so execrable\r\na manner as would scarce be credible, if it were not attested by almost\r\nthe universal consent of writers: they ripped up women with child, drew\r\nout the infants, and tossed them upon the points of their lances: they\r\nmurdered priests before the altars; then cutting the heads from off the\r\ncrucifixes, in their stead put on the heads of those they had murdered:\r\nwith many other instances of monstrous barbarity too foul to relate: but\r\ncruelty being usually attended with cowardice, this perfidious prince,\r\nupon the approach of King Stephen, fled into places of security. The\r\nKing of England, finding no enemy on whom to employ his revenge, marched\r\nforward into the country, destroying with fire and sword all the\r\nsouthern parts; and would, in all probability, have made terrible\r\nimpressions into the heart of Scotland, if he had not been suddenly\r\nrecalled by a more dangerous fire at home, which had been kindled in his\r\nabsence, and was now broken out into a flame.\r\n\r\nRobert Earl of Gloucester, natural son of the late King, came into\r\nEngland some time after the advancement of Stephen to the crown; and,\r\nyielding to the necessity of the time, took the oath of fealty upon the\r\nsame condition used by the other nobles, to be of force so long as the\r\nKing should keep his faith with him, and preserve his dignity inviolate:\r\nbut, being in his heart wholly devoted to the interests of the Empress\r\nhis sister, and moved by the persuasions of several religious men, he\r\nhad, with great secrecy and application, so far practised upon the\r\nlevity or discontents of several lords, as to gain them to his party:\r\nfor the King had, of late, very much alienated the nobles against him;\r\nfirst, by seizing several of their persons, and dispossessing them of\r\ntheir lands; and, secondly, by taking into his favour William d'Ypres, a\r\nFlemish commander, of noble birth, but banished by his prince. This man,\r\nwith many of his followers, the King employed chiefly both in his\r\ncouncils and his armies, and made him Earl of Kent, to the great envy\r\nand displeasure of his English subjects. The Earl of Gloucester,\r\ntherefore, and his accomplices, having prepared all things necessary for\r\nan insurrection, it was agreed among them, that while the King was\r\nengaged against the Scots, each of them should secure what towns and\r\ncastles they could, and openly declare for the Empress. Accordingly Earl\r\nRobert suddenly fortified himself in Bristol; the rest followed his\r\nexample; Hereford, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Dover,[30] and many other places,\r\nwere seized by several lords, and the defection grew so formidable, that\r\nthe King, to his great grief, was forced to leave his Scottish\r\nexpedition unfinished, and return with all possible speed to suppress\r\nthe rebellion begun by his subjects; having first left the care of the\r\nnorth to Thurstan Archbishop of York; with orders carefully to observe\r\nthe motions of the Scots.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Robert Earl of Gloucester had been entrusted by Stephen\r\nwith the custody of Dover Castle: but Robert lying now under heavy\r\nsuspicion, the King sent Matilda his queen to besiege it, in which she\r\nwas successful. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nWhilst the King was employed in the south in reducing his discontented\r\nlords, and their castles, to his obedience, David, presuming upon the\r\ndistance between them, reentered England with more numerous forces, and\r\ngreater designs, than before: for, without losing more time than what\r\nwas necessary to pillage and destroy the country as he marched, he\r\nresolved to besiege York, which, if he could force to surrender, would\r\nserve as a convenient frontier against the English. To this end,\r\nadvancing near the city, and having pitched his tents, he sat down\r\nbefore it with his whole army. In the mean time Archbishop Thurstan,\r\nhaving already summoned the nobles and gentry of the shire and parts\r\nadjacent, had, by powerful persuasions incited them to defend their\r\ncountry against a treacherous, bloody, and restless enemy: so that\r\nbefore the King of Scotland could make any progress in the siege, the\r\nwhole power of the north was united against him, under the Earl of\r\nAlbemarle, and several other nobles. Archbishop Thurstan happening to\r\nfall sick, could not go in person to the army, but sent the Bishop of\r\nDurham in his stead; by whose encouragements the English, although in\r\nnumber far inferior, advanced boldly towards the enemy, and offered them\r\nbattle, which was as readily accepted by the Scots, who, sending out a\r\nparty of horse to secure the rising ground, were immediately attacked by\r\nthe English, and, after a sharp dispute, entirely defeated. In the heat\r\nof the battle the King of Scots, and his son Henry Earl of Huntingdon,\r\ngave many proofs of great personal valour. The young prince fell with\r\nsuch fierceness upon a body of the English, that he utterly broke and\r\ndispersed them; and was pursuing his victory, when a certain man,\r\nbearing aloft the head of an enemy he had cut off, cried out, It was the\r\nhead of the Scottish King, which being heard and believed on both sides,\r\nthe English, who had lately fled, rallied again, assaulting their\r\nenemies with new vigour; the Scots, on the other side, discouraged by\r\nthe supposed death of their Prince, began to turn their backs: the King\r\nand his son used all endeavours to stop their flight, and made several\r\nbrave stands against the enemy; but the greatest part of their army\r\nbeing fled, and themselves almost encompassed, they were forced to give\r\nway to fortune, and with much difficulty made their escape.\r\n\r\nThe loss on the English side was inconsiderable; but of Scots, by\r\ngeneral consent of writers, ten thousand were slain. And thus ended the\r\nWar of the Standard, as it was usually called by the authors of that\r\nage, because the English, upon a certain engine, raised the mast of a\r\nship, on the top whereof, in a silver box, they put the consecrated\r\nwafer, and fastened the standards of St. Peter and other saints: this\r\ngave them courage, by remembering they were to fight in the presence of\r\nGod; and served likewise for a mark where to reassemble when they should\r\nhappen to be dispersed by any accident or misfortune.\r\n\r\n  1139\r\n\r\nMean time the King was equally successful against his rebellious lords\r\nat home, having taken most of their castles and strong-holds; and the\r\nEarl of Gloucester himself, no longer able to make any resistance,\r\nwithdrew into Normandy, to concert new measures with the Empress his\r\nsister. Thus the King had leisure and opportunity for another expedition\r\ninto Scotland, to pursue and improve his victory, where he met with no\r\nopposition: however, he was at length persuaded with much difficulty to\r\naccept his own conditions of a peace; and David delivered up to him his\r\neldest son Henry, as hostage for performance of articles between them.\r\n\r\nThe King, in his return homeward, laid siege to Ludlow Castle, which had\r\nnot been reduced with the rest: here Prince Henry of Scotland, boiling\r\nwith youth and valour, and exposing his person upon all occasions, was\r\nlifted from his horse by an iron grapple let down from the wall, and\r\nwould have been hoisted up into the castle, if the King had not\r\nimmediately flown to his assistance, and brought him off with his own\r\nhands by main force from the enemy, whom he soon compelled to surrender\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\n  1140\r\n\r\nStephen having thus subdued his inveterate enemies the Scots, and\r\nreduced his rebellious nobles, began to entertain hopes of enjoying a\r\nlittle ease. But he was destined to the possession of a crown with\r\nperpetual disturbance; for he was hardly returned from his northern\r\nexpedition, when he received intelligence that the Empress, accompanied\r\nby her brother the Earl of Gloucester, was preparing to come for\r\nEngland, in order to dispute her title to the kingdom. The King, who\r\nknew by experience what a powerful party she already had to espouse her\r\ninterests, very reasonably concluded, the defection from him would be\r\nmuch greater, when she appeared in person to countenance and reward it;\r\nhe therefore began again to repent of the licence he had granted for\r\nbuilding castles, which were now like to prove so many places of\r\nsecurity for his enemies, and fortifications against himself; for he\r\nknew not whom to trust, vehemently suspecting his nobles ever since\r\ntheir last revolt. He therefore cast about for some artifice to get into\r\nhis hands as many of their castles as he could: in the strength and\r\nmagnificence of which kind of structures, the bishops had far outdone\r\nthe rest, and were upon that, as well as other accounts, very much\r\nmaligned and envied by the temporal lords, who were extreme jealous of\r\nthe Church's increasing power, and glad upon all occasions to see the\r\nprelates humbled. The King, therefore, having formed his project,\r\nresolved to make trial where it would be least invidious, and where he\r\ncould foresee least danger in the consequences. At a Parliament or\r\nassembly of nobles at Oxford, it was contrived to raise a quarrel\r\nbetween the servants of some bishops and those of Alan Count of Dinan in\r\nBretagne, upon a contention of rooms in their inns. Stephen took hold of\r\nthis advantage, sent for the bishops, taxed them with breaking his\r\npeace, and demanded the keys of their castles, adding threats of\r\nimprisonment if they dared to disobey. Those whom the King chiefly\r\nsuspected, or rather who had built the most and strongest castles, were\r\nRoger Bishop of Salisbury, with his nephew and natural son the Bishops\r\nof Ely and Lincoln, whom the King, by many circumstances of rigour,\r\ncompelled to surrender, going himself in person to seize the Devizes,\r\nthen esteemed the noblest structure of Europe, and built by the\r\nforementioned Bishop Roger, whose treasure, to the value of forty\r\nthousand marks,[31] there likewise deposited, fell, at the same time,\r\ninto the King's hand, which in a few days broke the bishop's heart,\r\nalready worn with age and infirmity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: This prelate's treasure is doubtless computed by the\r\nsmaller or Saxon mark; the use of which still prevailed in England: and\r\neven thus computed, it amounts to a vast sum, equal to about £116,350 of\r\nmodern money. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, not be thought a digression to say something of the\r\nfortunes of this prelate, who, from the lowest beginnings, came to be,\r\nwithout dispute, the greatest churchman of any subject in his age. It\r\nhappened that the late King Henry, in the reign of his brother, being at\r\na village in Normandy, wanted a priest to say mass before him and his\r\ntrain, when this man, who was a poor curate thereabouts, offered his\r\nservice, and performed it with so much dexterity and speed, that the\r\nsoldiers who attended the prince recommended him to their master, upon\r\nthat account, as a very proper chaplain for military men; but it seems\r\nhe had other talents; for having gotten into the prince's service, he\r\nsoon discovered great application and address, much order and economy in\r\nthe management of his master's fortunes, which were wholly left to his\r\ncare. After Henry's advancement to the crown, this chaplain grew chief\r\nin his favour and confidence; was made Bishop of Salisbury, Chancellor\r\nof England, employed in all his most weighty affairs, and usually left\r\nvicegerent of the realm while the King was absent in Normandy. He was\r\namong the first that swore fealty to Maud and her issue; and among the\r\nfirst that revolted from her to Stephen, offering such reasons in\r\ncouncil for setting her aside, as, by the credit and opinion of his\r\nwisdom, were very prevalent. But the King, in a few years, forgot all\r\nobligations, and the bishop fell a sacrifice in his old age to those\r\ntreasures he had been so long heaping up for its support. A just reward\r\nfor his ingratitude towards the Prince that raised him, to be ruined by\r\nthe ingratitude of another, whom he had been so very instrumental to\r\nraise.\r\n\r\nBut Henry Bishop of Winchester, the Pope's legate, not able to endure\r\nthis violation of the Church, called a council of all the prelates to\r\nmeet at Winchester, where the King being summoned, appeared by his\r\nadvocate, who pleaded his cause with much learning; and the Archbishop\r\nof Rouen coming to the council, declared his opinion, That although the\r\ncanons did allow the bishops to possess castles, yet in dangerous times\r\nthey ought to deliver them up to the King. This opinion Stephen followed\r\nvery steadily, not yielding a tittle, although the legate his brother\r\nused all means, both rough and gentle, to work upon him.\r\n\r\nThe council of bishops broke up without other effect than that of\r\nleaving in their minds an implacable hatred to the King, in a very\r\nopportune juncture for the interests of Maud, who, about this time,\r\nlanded at Portsmouth with her brother Robert Earl of Gloucester. The\r\nwhole force she brought over for this expedition consisted but of one\r\nhundred and forty knights;[32] for she trusted altogether in her cause\r\nand her friends. With this slender attendance she went to Arundel, and\r\nwas there received into the castle by the widow of the late King; while\r\nEarl Robert, accompanied only by twenty men, marched boldly to his own\r\ncity of Gloucester, in order to raise forces for the Empress, where the\r\ntownsmen turned out the King's garrison as soon as they heard of his\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: In these times none served on horseback but gentlemen or\r\nknights, in right of their fiefs, or their representatives, called\r\n_Men-at-arms;_ and each of these was attended by at least two servants\r\nor retainers mounted and armed. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nKing Stephen was not surprised at the news of the Empress's arrival,\r\nbeing a thing he had always counted upon, and was long preparing himself\r\nagainst. He was glad to hear how ill she was provided, and resolved to\r\nuse the opportunity of her brother's absence; for, hasting down to\r\nArundel with a sufficient strength, he laid siege to the castle, in\r\nhopes, by securing her person, to put a speedy end to the war.\r\n\r\nBut there wanted not some very near about the King, who, favouring the\r\nparty of Maud, had credit enough to prevail with him not to venture time\r\nand reputation against an impregnable fortress, but rather, by\r\nwithdrawing his forces, permit her to retire to some less fortified\r\nplace, where she might more easily fall into his hands. This advice the\r\nKing took against his own opinion; the Empress fled out of Arundel by\r\nnight; and, after frequent shifting her stages through several towns,\r\nwhich had already declared in her favour, fixed herself at last at\r\nLincoln; where, having all things provided necessary for her defence,\r\nshe resolved to continue, and expect either a general revolt of the\r\nEnglish to her side, or the decision of war between the King and her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nBut Stephen, who had pursued the Empress from place to place, hearing\r\nshe had shut herself up in Lincoln, resolved to give her no rest; and to\r\nhelp on his design, it fell out that the citizens in hatred to the Earl\r\nof Chester, who commanded there for the Empress, sent a private\r\ninvitation to the King, with promise to deliver the town and their\r\ngovernor into his hands. The King came accordingly, and possessed\r\nhimself of the town; but Maud and the Earl made their escape a few days\r\nbefore. However, many great persons of Maud's party remained prisoners\r\nto the King, and among the rest the Earl of Chester's wife, who was\r\ndaughter to the Earl of Gloucester. These two Earls resolving to attempt\r\nthe relief of their friends, marched with all their forces near Lincoln,\r\nwhere they found the enemy drawn up and ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after battle offered by the lords, and accepted by the\r\nKing, both sides made ready to engage. The King having disposed his\r\ncavalry on each wing, placed himself at the head of his foot, in whom he\r\nreposed most confidence. The army of the lords was divided in three\r\nbodies; those whom King Stephen had banished were placed in the middle,\r\nthe Earl of Chester led the van, and the Earl of Gloucester commanded\r\nthe rear. The battle was fought at first with equal advantage, and great\r\nobstinacy on both sides; at length the right wing of the King's horse,\r\npressed by the Earl of Chester, galloped away, not without suspicion of\r\ntreachery; the left followed the example. The King beheld their flight,\r\nand encouraging those about him, fell with undaunted valour upon the\r\nenemy; and being for some time bravely seconded by his foot, did great\r\nexecution. At length overpowered by numbers, his men began to disperse,\r\nand Stephen was left almost alone with his sword in his hand, wherewith\r\nhe opposed his person against a whole victorious army, nor durst any be\r\nso hardy to approach him; the sword breaking, a citizen of Lincoln put\r\ninto his hands a Danish battle-axe,[33] with which he struck to the\r\nground the Earl of Chester,[34] who presumed to come within his reach.\r\nBut this weapon likewise flying in pieces with the force of those\r\nfurious blows he dealt on all sides, a bold knight of the Empress's\r\nparty, named William de Keynes, laid hold on his helmet, and immediately\r\ncried out to his fellows, \"I have got the King.\" Then the rest ran in,\r\nand he was taken prisoner.[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Sim. Dunelmensis. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The Earl of Chester lived nevertheless to fight other\r\nbattles, and died twelve years afterwards by poison. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Gervase. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe King being thus secured, was presented to the Empress, then at\r\nGloucester, and by her orders conveyed to Bristol, where he continued in\r\nstrict custody nine months, although with honourable treatment for some\r\ntime, until either upon endeavouring to make his escape, or in malice to\r\nthe Londoners, who had a great affection for their King, he was, by\r\nexpress command from the Empress, laid in irons, and used with other\r\ncircumstances of severity.\r\n\r\nThis victory was followed by a general defection of almost the whole\r\nkingdom; and the Earl of Anjou, husband to the Empress, upon the fame of\r\nthe King's defeat and imprisonment, reduced without any difficulty the\r\nwhole Duchy of Normandy to his obedience.\r\n\r\nThe legate himself, although brother to King Stephen, received her at\r\nWinchester with great solemnity, accepted her oath for governing with\r\njustice, redressing grievances, and supporting the rights of the Church,\r\nand took the old conditional one of fealty to her; then in an assembly\r\nof bishops and clergy convoked for the purpose, he displayed the\r\nmiscarriages of his brother, and declared his approbation of the Empress\r\nto be Queen; to which they unanimously agreed. To complete all, he\r\nprevailed by his credit with the Londoners, who stood out the last of\r\nany, to acknowledge and receive her into the city, where she arrived at\r\nlength in great pomp, and with general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut it was the misfortune of this Princess to possess many weaknesses\r\nthat are charged to the sex, and very few of its commendable qualities:\r\nshe was now in peaceable possession of the whole kingdom, except the\r\ncounty of Kent, where William d'Ypres pretended to keep up a small party\r\nfor the King; when by her pride, wilfulness, indiscretion, and a\r\ndisobliging behaviour, she soon turned the hearts of all men against\r\nher, and in a short time lost the fruits of that victory and success\r\nwhich had been so hardly gained by the prudence and valour of her\r\nexcellent brother. The first occasion she took to discover the\r\nperverseness of her nature, was in the treatment of Maud, the wife of\r\nKing Stephen, a lady of great virtue, and courage above her sex, who,\r\ncoming to the Empress an humble suitor in behalf of her husband,\r\noffered, as a price of his liberty, that he should resign all\r\npretensions to the crown, and pass the rest of his life in exile, or in\r\na convent: but this request was rejected with scorn and reproaches; and\r\nthe Queen finding all entreaties to no purpose, writ to her son Eustace\r\nto let him understand the ill success of her negotiation, that no relief\r\nwas to be otherwise hoped for than by arms, and therefore advised him to\r\nraise immediately what forces he could for the relief of his father.\r\n\r\nHer next miscarriage was towards the Londoners, who presented her a\r\npetition for redressing certain rigorous laws of her father, and\r\nrestoring those of Edward the Confessor. The Empress put them off for a\r\ntime with excuses, but at last discovered some displeasure at their\r\nimportunity. The citizens, who had with much difficulty been persuaded\r\nto receive her against their inclinations, which stood wholly for the\r\nKing, were moved with indignation at her unreasonable refusal of their\r\njust demands, and entered into a conspiracy to seize her person. But she\r\nhad timely notice of their design, and leaving the city by night in\r\ndisguise, fled to Oxford.\r\n\r\nA third false step the Empress made,[36] was in refusing her new\r\npowerful friend the legate a favour he desired in behalf of Eustace, the\r\nKing's son, to grant him the lands and honours held by his father before\r\nhe came to the crown. She had made large promises to this prelate, that\r\nshe would be directed in all things by his advice, and to be refused\r\nupon his first application a small favour for his own nephew, stung him\r\nto the quick; however, he governed his resentments a while, but began at\r\nthe same time to resume his affection for his brother. These thoughts\r\nwere cultivated with great address by Queen Maud, who prevailed at last\r\nso far upon the legate, that private measures were agreed between them\r\nfor restoring Stephen to his liberty and crown. The bishop took leave of\r\nthe Empress, upon some plausible pretence, and retired to Winchester,\r\nwhere he gave directions for supplying with men and provisions several\r\nstrong castles he had built in his diocese, while the Queen with her son\r\nEustace prevailed with the Londoners and men of Kent to rise in great\r\nnumbers for the King; and a powerful army was quickly on foot, under the\r\ncommand of William d'Ypres Earl of Kent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: William of Malmesbury. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Empress began to be sensible of the errors she had\r\ncommitted; and in hope either to retrieve the friendship of the legate,\r\nor take him prisoner, marched with her army to Winchester, where being\r\nreceived and lodged in the castle, she sent immediately for the legate,\r\nspoke much in excuse of what was past, and used all endeavours to regain\r\nhim to her interests. Bishop Henry, on the other side, amused her with\r\ndubious answers, and kept her in suspense for some days; but sent\r\nprivately at the same time to the King's army, desiring them to advance\r\nwith all possible speed; which was executed with so much diligence, that\r\nthe Empress and her brother had only time with their troops to march a\r\nback way out of the town. They were pursued by the enemy so close in the\r\nrear, that the Empress had hardly time, by counterfeiting herself dead,\r\nto make her escape; in which posture she was carried as a corpse to\r\nGloucester; but the Earl her brother, while he made what opposition he\r\ncould, with design to stop her pursuers, was himself taken prisoner,\r\nwith great slaughter of his men. After the battle, the Earl was in his\r\nturn presented to Queen Maud, and by her command sent to Rochester to be\r\ntreated in the same manner with the King.\r\n\r\nThus the heads of both parties were each in the power of his enemy, and\r\nFortune seemed to have dealt with great equality between them. Two\r\nfactions divided the whole kingdom, and, as it usually happens, private\r\nanimosities were inflamed by the quarrel of the public; which introduced\r\na miserable face of things throughout the land, whereof the writers of\r\nour English story give melancholy descriptions, not to be repeated in\r\nthis history; since the usual effects of civil war are obvious to\r\nconceive, and tiresome as well as useless to relate. However, as the\r\nquarrel between the King and Empress was grounded upon a cause that in\r\nits own nature little concerned the interests of the people, this was\r\nthought a convenient juncture for transacting a peace, to which there\r\nappeared an universal disposition. Several expedients were proposed; but\r\nEarl Robert would consent upon no other terms than the deposing of\r\nStephen, and immediate delivery of the crown to his sister. These\r\ndebates lasted for some months, until the two prisoners, weary of their\r\nlong constraint, by mutual consent were exchanged for each other, and\r\nall thoughts of agreement laid aside.\r\n\r\nThe King, upon recovery of his freedom, hastened to London, to get\r\nsupplies of men and money for renewing the war. He there found that his\r\nbrother of Winchester had, in a council of bishops and abbots, renounced\r\nall obedience to the Empress, and persuaded the assembly to follow his\r\nexample. The legate, in excuse for this proceeding, loaded her with\r\ninfamy, produced several instances wherein she had broken the oath she\r\ntook when he received her as Queen, and upon which his obedience was\r\ngrounded; said, he had received information that she had a design upon\r\nhis life.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: William of Malmesbury. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that oaths of fealty in this Prince's reign were\r\nfeeble ties for binding the subject to any reasonable degree of\r\nobedience; and the warmest advocates for liberty cannot but allow, from\r\nthose examples here produced, that it is very possible for people to run\r\nupon great extremes in this matter, that a monarch may be too much\r\nlimited, and a subject too little; whereof the consequences have been\r\nfully as pernicious for the time as the worst that can be apprehended\r\nfrom arbitrary power in all its heights, although not perhaps so lasting\r\nor so hard to be remedied; since all the miseries of this kingdom,\r\nduring the period we are treating of, were manifestly owing to that\r\ncontinual violation of such oaths of allegiance, as appear to have been\r\ncontrived on purpose by ambitious men to be broken at pleasure, without\r\nthe least apprehension of perjury, and in the mean time keep the prince\r\nin a continual slavish dependence.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Gloucester, soon after his release, went over into Normandy,\r\nwhere he found the Earl of Anjou employed in completing the conquest of\r\nthat duchy; there he delivered him the sons of several English noblemen,\r\nto be kept as hostages for their fathers' fidelity to the Empress, and\r\nused many arguments for persuading him to come over in person with an\r\narmy to her assistance: but Geoffrey excused himself by the importance\r\nof other affairs, and the danger of exposing the dominions he had newly\r\nacquired to rebellions in his absence. However, he lent the Earl of\r\nGloucester a supply of four hundred men, and sent along with him his\r\neldest son Henry, to comfort his mother, and be shewn to the people.\r\n\r\nDuring the short absence of the Earl of Gloucester, the Empress was\r\nclosely besieged in Oxford by the King; and provisions beginning to\r\nfail, she was in cruel apprehensions of falling into his hands. This\r\ngave her occasion to put in practice the only talent wherein she seemed\r\nto excel, which was that of contriving some little shift or expedient to\r\nsecure her person upon any sudden emergency. A long season of frost had\r\nmade the Thames passable upon the ice, and much snow lay on the ground;\r\nMaud with some few attendants clad all in white, to avoid being\r\ndiscovered from the King's camp, crossed the river at midnight on foot,\r\nand travelling all night, got safe to Wallingford Castle, where her\r\nbrother and young son Henry, newly returned from France, arrived soon\r\nafter, to her great satisfaction: but Oxford, immediately upon the news\r\nof her flight, surrendered to the King.\r\n\r\nHowever, this disgrace was fully compensated soon after by another of\r\nthe same kind, which happened to King Stephen; for whilst he and his\r\nbrother of Winchester were fortifying a nunnery at Wilton, to bridle his\r\nenemies at Salisbury, who very much harassed those parts by their\r\nfrequent excursions, the Earl of Gloucester, who watched all\r\nopportunities, came unaware with a strong body of men, and set fire on\r\nthe nunnery while the King himself was in it. Stephen, upon the sudden\r\nsurprise of the thing, wholly lost or forgot his usual courage, and fled\r\nshamefully away, leaving his soldiers to be cut in pieces by the Earl.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the war, although it lasted nine years longer, there\r\nis little memorable recorded by any writer; whether the parties being\r\npretty equal, and both sufficiently tired with so long a contention,\r\nwanted vigour and spirit to make a thorough conquest, and only\r\nendeavoured to keep what they had, or whether the multitude of strong\r\ncastles, whose number daily increased, made it very difficult to end a\r\nwar between two contending powers almost in balance; let the cause be\r\nwhat it will, the whole time passed in mutual sieges, surprises,\r\nrevolts, surrenders of fortified places, without any decisive action, or\r\nother event of importance to be related. By which at length the very\r\ngenius of the people became wholly bent upon a life of spoil, robbery,\r\nand plunder; many of the nobles, although pretending to hold their\r\ncastles for the King or the Empress, lived like petty independent\r\nprinces in a perpetual state of war against their neighbours; the fields\r\nlay uncultivated, all the arts of civil life were banished, no\r\nveneration left for sacred persons or things; in short, no law, truth,\r\nor religion among men, but a scene of universal misery, attended with\r\nall the consequences of an embroiled and distracted state.\r\n\r\nAbout the eleventh year of the King's reign, young Henry, now growing\r\ntowards a man, was sent for to France by a message from his father, who\r\nwas desirous to see him; but left a considerable party in England, to\r\nadhere to his interests; and in a short time after (as some write[38])\r\nthe Empress herself grown weary of contending any longer in a cause\r\nwhere she had met with nothing but misfortunes of her own procuring,\r\nleft the kingdom likewise, and retired to her husband. Nor was this the\r\nonly good fortune that befell Stephen; for before the year ended, the\r\nmain prop and pillar of his enemies was taken away by death; this was\r\nRobert Earl of Gloucester, than whom there have been few private persons\r\nknown in the world that deserve a fairer place and character in the\r\nregisters of time, for his inviolable faith, disinterested friendship,\r\nindefatigable zeal, and firm constancy to the cause he espoused, and\r\nunparalleled generosity in the conduct thereof: he adhered to his sister\r\nin all her fortunes, to the ruin of his own; he placed a crown on her\r\nhead; and when she had lost it by her folly and perverseness refused the\r\ngreatest offers from a victorious enemy, who had him in his power, and\r\nchose to continue a prisoner rather than recover his liberty by any\r\nhazard to her pretensions: he bore up her sinking title in spite of her\r\nown frequent miscarriages, and at last died in her cause by a fever\r\ncontracted with perpetual toils for her service. An example fit to be\r\nshewn the world, although few perhaps are like to follow it; but\r\nhowever, a small tribute of praise, justly due to extraordinary virtue,\r\nmay prove no ill expedient to encourage imitation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Gervase. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut the death of this lord, together with the absence of the Empress and\r\nher son in France, added very little to the quiet or security of the\r\nKing. For the Earl of Gloucester, suspecting the fidelity of the lords,\r\nhad, with great sagacity, delivered their sons to the Earl of Anjou, to\r\nbe kept as pledges for their fathers' fidelity, as we have before\r\nrelated: by which means a powerful party was still kept up against\r\nStephen, too strong to be suddenly broken. Besides, he had, by an\r\nunusual strain of his conduct, lately lost much good-will, as well as\r\nreputation, in committing an act of violence and fraud on the person of\r\nthe Earl of Chester, a principal adherent of the Empress. This nobleman,\r\nof great power and possessions, had newly reconciled himself to Stephen,\r\nand came to his court at Northampton, where, against all laws of\r\nhospitality, as well as common faith and justice, he was committed to\r\nprison, and forced to buy his liberty with the surrender of Lincoln, and\r\nall his other places, into the King's hands.\r\n\r\n  1149.\r\n\r\n  1150.\r\n\r\nAffairs continued in this turbulent posture about two years, the nobles\r\nneither trusting the King nor each other. The number of castles still\r\nincreased, which every man who had any possessions was forced to build,\r\nor else become a prey to his powerful neighbours. This was thought a\r\nconvenient juncture, by the Empress and her friends, for sending young\r\nPrince Henry to try his fortune in England, where he landed at the head\r\nof a considerable number of horse and foot, although he was then but\r\nsixteen years old. Immediately after his arrival he went to Carlisle,\r\nwhere he met his cousin David King of Scots, by whom he was made knight,\r\nafter the usual custom of young princes and noblemen in that age. The\r\nKing of England, who had soon intelligence of Henry's landing and\r\nmotions, marched down to secure York, against which he expected the\r\nfirst attempt of his enemy was designed. But, whatever the cause might\r\nbe (wherein the writers of those ages are either silent or\r\nunsatisfactory) both armies remained at that secure distance for three\r\nmonths, after which Henry returned back to Normandy, leaving the kingdom\r\nin the state of confusion he found it at his coming.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of this young prince Henry Fitz-Empress now began to\r\nadvance by great and sudden steps, whereof it will be no digression to\r\ninform the reader, as well upon the connection they have with the\r\naffairs at home about this time, as because they concern the immediate\r\nsuccessor to the crown.\r\n\r\n  1151.\r\n\r\nPrince Henry's voyage to France was soon followed by the death of his\r\nfather Geoffrey Earl of Anjou, whereby the son became possessed of that\r\nearldom, together with the Duchy of Normandy; but in a short time after\r\nhe very much enlarged his dominions by a marriage, in which he consulted\r\nhis reputation less than his advantage. For Louis the Young, King of\r\nFrance, was lately divorced from his wife Eleanor, who, as the French\r\nwriters relate, bore a great contempt and hatred to her husband, and had\r\nlong desired such a separation. Other authors give her not so fair a\r\ncharacter: but whatever might be the real cause, the pretext was\r\nconsanguinity in the fourth degree.[39] Henry was content to accept this\r\nlady with all her faults, and in her right became Duke of Aquitaine, and\r\nEarl of Poitou, very considerable provinces, added to his other\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Louis VII., after living fourteen years with his Queen,\r\nobtained a dissolution of the marriage on the plea of relationship\r\nwithin the prohibited degrees. See Bouchet, \"Annalles d'Acquitaine.\"\r\n[W.S.J.]]\r\n\r\nBut the two Kings of France and England began to apprehend much danger\r\nfrom the sudden greatness of a young ambitious prince; and their\r\ninterests were jointly concerned to check his growth. Duke Henry was now\r\nready to sail for England, in a condition to assert his title upon more\r\nequal terms; when the King of France, in conjunction with Eustace, King\r\nStephen's son, and Geoffrey, the Duke's own brother, suddenly entered\r\ninto his dominions with a mighty army; took the Castle of Neufmarché by\r\nstorm, and laid siege to that of Angers. The Duke, by this incident, was\r\nforced to lay aside his thoughts of England, and marching boldly towards\r\nthe enemy, resolved to relieve the besieged; but finding they had\r\nalready taken the castle, he thought it best to make a diversion, by\r\ncarrying the war into the enemy's country, where he left all to the\r\nmercy of his soldiers, surprised and burnt several castles, and made\r\ngreat devastations wherever he came. This proceeding answered the end\r\nfor which it was designed; the King of France thought he had already\r\ndone enough for his honour, and began to grow weary of a ruinous war,\r\nwhich was likely to be protracted. The conditions of a peace, by the\r\nintervention of some religious men, were soon agreed. The Duke, after\r\nsome time spent in settling his affairs, and preparing all things\r\nnecessary for his intended expedition, set sail for England, where he\r\nlanded[40] the same year in the depth of winter, with a hundred and\r\nforty knights, and three thousand foot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The place where he landed is not mentioned by our\r\nhistorians. It was probably in the West of England, as the first\r\ngarrisoned town he attacked was Malmesbury. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nSome time before Henry landed, the King had conceived a project to\r\ndisappoint his designs, by confirming the crown upon himself and his own\r\nposterity.[41] He sent for the Archbishop of Canterbury, with several\r\nother prelates, and proposed that his son Eustace should be crowned King\r\nwith all the usual solemnity: but the bishops absolutely refused to\r\nperform the office, by express orders from the Pope, who was an enemy to\r\nStephen, partly upon account of his unjust or declining cause, but\r\nchiefly for his strict alliance with the King of France, who was then\r\nengaged in a quarrel against that See, upon a very tender point relating\r\nto the revenues of vacant churches. The King and his son were both\r\nenraged at the bishops' refusal, and kept them prisoners in the chamber\r\nwhere they assembled, with many threats to force them to a compliance,\r\nand some other circumstances of rigour; but all to no purpose, so that\r\nhe was at length forced to desist. But the archbishop, to avoid further\r\nvexation, fled the realm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Gervase, Hen. Huntingdon. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis contrivance of crowning the son during the life and reign of the\r\nfather, which appears so absurd in speculation, was actually performed\r\nin the succeeding reign, and seems to have been taken up by those two\r\nprinces of French birth and extraction, in imitation of the like\r\npractice in their native country,[42] where it was usual for kings grown\r\nold and infirm, or swayed by paternal indulgence, to receive their\r\neldest son into a share of the administration, with the title of King; a\r\ncustom borrowed, no doubt, from the later emperors of Rome, who adopted\r\ntheir Caesars after the like manner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Mezeray. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n  1153\r\n\r\nThe King was employed in his usual exercise of besieging castles when\r\nthe news was brought of Henry's arrival. He left the work he was about,\r\nand marched directly against the Duke, who was then sat down before\r\nMalmesbury. But Stephen forced him to raise the siege, and immediately\r\noffered him battle. The Duke, although his army was much increased by\r\ncontinual revolts, thought it best to gain time, being still in number\r\nfar inferior to the King, and therefore kept himself strongly\r\nentrenched. There is some difference among writers about the particulars\r\nof this war: however, it is generally agreed, that in a short time\r\nafter, the two armies met, and were prepared for battle, when the nobles\r\non both sides, either dreading the consequences, or weary of a tedious\r\nwar, prevailed with the King and Duke to agree to a truce for some days\r\nin order to a peace; which was violently opposed by Eustace, the King's\r\nson, a youth of great spirit and courage, because he knew very well it\r\ncould not be built but upon the ruin of his interests; and therefore\r\nfinding he could not prevail, he left the army in a rage, and, attended\r\nby some followers, endeavoured to satiate his fury, by destroying the\r\ncountry in his march: But in a few days, as he sat at dinner in a castle\r\nof his own, he fell suddenly dead, either through grief, madness, or\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nThe truce was now expired, and the Duke began to renew the war with\r\nfresh vigour; but the King was wholly dispirited upon this fatal\r\naccident, and now first began to entertain real thoughts of a peace. He\r\nhad lost a son whom he dearly loved, and with him he likewise lost the\r\nalliance of the French King, to whose sister the young prince was\r\nmarried. He had indeed another son left, but little esteemed by the\r\nnobles and people; nor, as it appears, much regarded by his father. He\r\nwas now in the decline of his age, decayed in his health, forsaken by\r\nhis friends, who, since the death of Eustace, fell daily from him; and\r\nhaving no further care at heart for his posterity, he thought it high\r\ntime to seek repose for his person. The nobles soon observed this\r\ndisposition in their King, which was so agreeable to their own;\r\ntherefore, by general consent, Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury was\r\nappointed mediator between both princes. All matters were soon agreed;\r\nan assembly of lords was convened at Winchester, where the King received\r\nthe Duke with great marks of courtesy and kindness. There the peace was\r\nconfirmed by the King's charter, wherein are expressed the terms of\r\nagreement. But I shall relate only the principal.\r\n\r\nThe King, by this charter, acknowledged Henry for lawful successor to\r\nthe crown; in which capacity all the nobles paid him homage: and Henry\r\nhimself, with his party, paid homage to Stephen. There is likewise a\r\nreservation for William, the King's son, of all the honours possessed by\r\nhis father before he came to the crown. The King likewise acknowledges\r\nthe obedience of his subjects to be no longer due to him than he shall\r\nobserve the conditions of this charter. And for the performance of these\r\narticles, the archbishops and bishops were appointed guarantees. There\r\nwere some other articles agreed on, which are not mentioned in the\r\ncharter; as, a general pardon; a restitution, to the right owners, of\r\nthose lands and possessions, which had been usurped in the time of the\r\ntroubles; that all castles built during the war should be razed to the\r\nground, which are said to have been above eleven hundred; that the\r\nrights of the Church should be preserved; with other matters of less\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThus, by the prudence of Archbishop Theobald, the moderation of the two\r\nprinces engaged, and the universal inclination of the people, a happy\r\nperiod was put to this tedious and troublesome war: men began to have\r\nthe prospect of a long peace; nor was it easy to foresee what could\r\npossibly arise to disturb it; when discovery was made, by accident, of a\r\nmost horrible piece of treachery, which, if it had met with success,\r\nwould have once more set the whole nation in a flame. The Duke, after\r\nthe peace, attended the King to London, to be shewn to the people as the\r\nundoubted successor to the crown; and having made a progress together\r\nthrough some other parts of the kingdom, they came to Canterbury; where\r\nHenry received private notice of a design upon his life. It hath been\r\nalready observed, that the King employed in his wars a body of Flemings,\r\nto the great discontent of his own subjects, with whom they were very\r\nungracious. These foreigners were much discontented at the peace,\r\nwhereby they were likely to become useless and burthensome to the\r\npresent King, and hateful to the successor. To prevent which, the\r\ncommanders among them began to practise upon the levity and ambition of\r\nWilliam the King's son. They urged the indignity he had received in\r\nbeing deprived of his birthright; offered to support his title by their\r\nvalour, as they had done that of his father; and, as an earnest of their\r\nintentions, to remove the chief impediment by dispatching his rival out\r\nof the world, The young prince was easily wrought upon to be at the head\r\nof this conspiracy; time and place were fixed; when, upon the day\r\nappointed, William broke his leg by a fall from his horse; and the\r\nconspirators wanting their leader immediately dispersed. This\r\ndisappointment and delay, as it usually happens among conspirators, were\r\nsoon followed by a discovery of the whole plot, whereof the Duke, with\r\ngreat discretion, made no other use than to consult his own safety;\r\ntherefore, without any shew of suspicion or displeasure, he took leave\r\nof the King, and returned to Normandy.\r\n\r\n  1154.\r\n\r\nStephen lived not above a year to share the happiness of this peace with\r\nhis people, in which time he made a progress through most parts of the\r\nkingdom, where he gained universal love and veneration, by a most\r\naffable and courteous behaviour to all men. A few months after his\r\nreturn he went to Dover, to have an interview with the Earl of\r\nFlanders;[43] where, after a short sickness, he died of the iliac\r\npassion, together with his old distemper the hemorrhoids, upon the\r\ntwenty-fifth day of October, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and the\r\nnineteenth of his reign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: The Earl of Flanders was a potent sovereign on the\r\ncontinent, and had landed at Dover, in order to meet and confer with the\r\nKing. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nHe was a prince of wonderful endowments, both in body and mind: in his\r\nperson tall and graceful, of great strength as well as vigour: he had a\r\nlarge portion of most virtues that can be useful in a King towards the\r\nhappiness of his subjects or himself; courtesy and valour, liberality\r\nand clemency, in an eminent degree; especially the last, which he\r\ncarried to an extreme, though very pardonable, yet hardly consisting\r\nwith prudence, or his own safety. If we except his usurpation of the\r\ncrown, he must be allowed a prince of great justice, which most writers\r\naffirm to have been always unblemished, except in that single instance:\r\nfor, as to his treatment of the bishops and the Earl of Chester, it\r\nseems very excusable by the necessity of the time; and it was the\r\ngeneral opinion, if he had not used that proceeding with the latter, it\r\nwould have cost him his crown. Perhaps his injustice to the Empress\r\nmight likewise admit a little extenuation. Four kings successively had\r\nsat on the throne without any regard to lineal descent; a period beyond\r\nthe memory of most men then alive; whereby the people had lost much of\r\nthat devotion they were used to bear towards an established succession:\r\nbesides, the government of a woman was then a thing unknown, and for\r\nthat reason disliked by all who professed to hate innovations.\r\n\r\nBut the wisdom of this prince was by no means equal to the rest of his\r\nvirtues. He came to the crown upon as fair a title as his predecessor,\r\nbeing elected by the general consent of the nobles, through the credit\r\nof his brother, and his own personal merit. He had no disturbance for\r\nsome time, which he might easily have employed in settling the kingdom,\r\nand acquiring the love of his people. He had treasure enough to raise\r\nand pay armies, without burthening the subject. His competitor was a\r\nwoman, whose sex was the least of her infirmities, and with whom he had\r\nalready compounded for his quiet by a considerable pension: yet with all\r\nthese advantages he seldom was master of above half the kingdom at once,\r\nand that by the force of perpetual struggling, and with frequent danger\r\nof losing the whole. The principal difficulties he had to encounter,\r\nappear to have been manifest consequences of several most imprudent\r\nsteps in his conduct, whereof many instances have been produced in the\r\nhistory of his reign; such as, the unlimited permission of building\r\ncastles; his raising the siege of a weak place where the Empress was\r\nshut up, and must, in a few days, have fallen into his hands; his\r\nemploying the Flemings in his wars, and favouring them above his own\r\nsubjects; and lastly, that abortive project of crowning his son, which\r\nprocured him at once the hatred and contempt of the clergy, by\r\ndiscovering an inclination to violence and injustice that he durst not\r\npursue: whereas, it was nothing else but an effect of that hasty and\r\nsudden disposition usually ascribed to those of his country, and in a\r\npeculiar manner charged to this prince: for authors give it as a part of\r\nhis character, to be hot and violent in the beginning of an enterprise,\r\nbut to slacken and grow cold in the prosecution.\r\n\r\nHe had a just sense of religion, and was frequent in attending the\r\nservice of the Church, yet reported to be no great friend of the clergy;\r\nwhich, however, is a general imputation upon all the kings of this realm\r\nin that and some succeeding reigns, and by no means personal to this\r\nprince, who deserved it as little as any.\r\n\r\nI do not find any alterations during this reign in the meetings of\r\ngeneral assemblies, further than that the Commons do not seem to have\r\nbeen represented in any of them; for which I can assign no other reason\r\nthan the will of the King, or the disturbance of the time.[44] I\r\nobserved the word Parliament is used promiscuously among authors, for a\r\ngeneral assembly of nobles, and for a council of bishops, or synod of\r\nthe clergy; which renders this matter too perplexed to ascertain\r\nanything about it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: The rise and history of Parliaments had not been cleared\r\nup when the Doctor writ in the beginning of this current century. It is\r\ncertain, that the Commons had as yet never been represented. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nAs for affairs of the Church, that deserve particular mention, I have\r\nnot met with any; unless it should be worth relating, that Henry Bishop\r\nof Winchester, the Pope's legate, who held frequent synods during this\r\nreign, was the first introducer of appeals to Rome, in this kingdom, for\r\nwhich he is blamed by all the monkish historians who give us the\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF HENRY THE SECOND\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT\r\n\r\n  1154.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of war and contention, which had for a long time possessed\r\nthe nation, became so effectually laid during the last year of King\r\nStephen's reign, that no alteration or disturbance ensued upon his\r\ndeath, although the new King,[45] after he had received intelligence of\r\nit, was detained six weeks[46] by contrary winds: besides, the opinion\r\nof this prince's power and virtues, had already begotten so great an awe\r\nand reverence for him among the people, that upon his arrival he found\r\nthe whole kingdom in a profound peace. He landed at Hostreham,[47] about\r\nthe beginning of December, was received at Winchester by a great number\r\nof the nobility, who came there to attend and swear fealty to him, and\r\nthree weeks after was crowned at Westminster, about the twenty-third\r\nyear of his age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Henry was at that time besieging a castle on the frontiers\r\nof Normandy. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Five weeks at the most; a month, saith Brompton. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: At Hostreham, saith Gervase. This place is not easy to be\r\nfound; however, it must be on the Sussex or Hampshire coast, because the\r\nKing went directly from the place of his landing to Winchester. Carte\r\nsays he landed December 8th, near Hurst Castle in the New Forest.\r\n[D.S.]]\r\n\r\nFor the further settling of the kingdom, after the long distractions in\r\nthe preceding reign, he seized on all the castles which remained\r\nundestroyed since the last peace between him and King Stephen; whereof\r\nsome he demolished, and trusted others to the government of persons in\r\nwhom he could confide.\r\n\r\nBut that which most contributed to the quiet of the realm, and the\r\ngeneral satisfaction of his subjects, was a proclamation published,\r\ncommanding all foreigners to leave England, enforced with a most\r\neffectual clause, whereby a day was fixed, after which it should be\r\ncapital for any of them to appear; among these was William d'Ypres Earl\r\nof Kent, whose possessions the King seized into his own hands.\r\n\r\nThese foreigners, generally called Flemings by the writers of the\r\nEnglish story, were a sort of vagabond soldiers of fortune, who in those\r\nages, under several denominations, infested other parts of Europe as\r\nwell as England: they were a mixed people, natives of Arragon, Navarre,\r\nBiscay, Brabant, and other parts of Spain and Flanders. They were ready\r\nto be hired to whatever prince thought fit to employ them, but always\r\nupon condition to have full liberty of plunder and spoil. Nor was it an\r\neasy matter to get rid of them, when there was no further need of their\r\nservice. In England they were always hated by the people, and by this\r\nprince in particular, whose continual enemies they had been.\r\n\r\nAfter the expulsion of these foreigners, and the forcing a few\r\nrefractory lords to a surrender of their castles, King Henry, like a\r\nwise prince, began to consider that a time of settled peace was the\r\nfittest juncture to recover the rights of the crown, which had been lost\r\nby the war. He therefore resumed, by his royal authority, all crown\r\nlands that had been alienated by his predecessor; alleging that they\r\nwere unalienable in themselves, and besides, that the grants were void,\r\nas coming from an usurper. Whether such proceedings are agreeable with\r\njustice, I shall not examine; but certainly a prince cannot better\r\nconsult his own safety than by disabling those whom he renders\r\ndiscontent, which is effectually done no other way but by depriving them\r\nof their possessions.\r\n\r\n  1156.\r\n\r\nWhile the King was thus employed at home, intelligence came that his\r\nbrother Geoffrey was endeavouring by force to possess himself of the\r\nEarldom of Anjou, to which he had fair pretensions; for their father\r\nconsidering what vast dominions would fall to his eldest son, bequeathed\r\nthat earldom to the second in his last sickness, and commanded his\r\nnobles then about him, to take an oath that they would not suffer his\r\nbody to be buried until Henry (who was then absent) should swear to\r\nobserve his will. The Duke of Normandy, when he came to assist at his\r\nfather's obsequies, and found that without his compliance he must draw\r\nupon himself the scandal of keeping a father unburied, took the oath\r\nthat was exacted for observance of his will, though very much against\r\nhis own. But after he was in possession of England, whether it were that\r\nhis ambition enlarged with his dominions, or that from the beginning he\r\nhad never intended to observe what he had sworn, he prevailed with Pope\r\nAdrian (of English birth) to dispense with his oath, and in the second\r\nyear of his reign went over into Normandy, drove his brother entirely\r\nout of Anjou, and forced him to accept a pension for his maintenance.\r\nBut the young prince, through the resentment of this unnatural dealing,\r\nin a short time died of grief.\r\n\r\nNor was his treatment more favourable to the King of Scots, whom, upon a\r\nslight pretence, he took occasion to dispossess of Carlisle, Newcastle,\r\nand other places granted by the Empress to that prince's father, for his\r\nservices and assistance in her quarrel against Stephen.\r\n\r\nHaving thus recovered whatever he had any title to demand, he began to\r\nlook out for new acquisitions. Ireland was in that age a country little\r\nknown in the world. The legates sent sometimes thither from the Court of\r\nRome, for urging the payment of annats, or directing other Church\r\naffairs, represented the inhabitants as a savage people, overrun with\r\nbarbarism and superstition: for indeed no nation of Europe, where the\r\nChristian religion received so early and universal admittance, was ever\r\nso late or slow in feeling its effects upon their manners and\r\ncivility.[48] Instead of refining their manners by their faith, they had\r\nsuffered their faith to be corrupted by their manners; true religion\r\nbeing almost defaced, both in doctrine and discipline, after a long\r\ncourse of time, among a people wholly sunk in ignorance and barbarity.\r\nThere seem to have been two reasons why the inhabitants of that island\r\ncontinued so long uncultivated; first, their subjection or vassalage to\r\nso many petty kings, whereof a great number is mentioned by authors,\r\nbesides those four or five usually assigned to the several provinces.\r\nThese princes were engaged in perpetual quarrels, in doing or revenging\r\ninjuries of violence, or lust, or treachery, or injustice, which kept\r\nthem all in a continual state of war. And indeed there is hardly any\r\ncountry, how renowned soever in ancient or modern story, which may not\r\nbe traced from the like original. Neither can a nation come out from\r\nthis state of confusion, until it is either reduced under one head at\r\nhome, or by force or conquest becomes subject to a foreign\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The Irish had been very learned in former ages, but had\r\ndeclined for several centuries before the reign of Henry II. _Vide_\r\nBede. [D.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe other reason why civility made such late entrances into that island,\r\nmay be imputed to its natural situation, lying more out of the road of\r\ncommerce or conquest than any other part of the known world. All the\r\nintercourse the inhabitants had, was only with the western coasts of\r\nWales and Scotland, from whence, at least in those ages, they were not\r\nlike to learn very much politeness.\r\n\r\n  1155.\r\n\r\nThe King, about the second year of his reign, sent ambassadors to Pope\r\nAdrian, with injunctions to desire his licence for reducing the savage\r\npeople of Ireland from their brutish way of living, and subjecting them\r\nto the crown of England. The King proceeded thus, in order to set up a\r\ntitle to the island, wherein the Pope himself pretended to be lord of\r\nthe see; for in his letter, which is an answer and grant to the King's\r\nrequests, he insists upon it, that all islands, upon their admitting the\r\nChristian faith, become subject to the See of Rome; and the Irish\r\nthemselves avowed the same thing to some of the first conquerors. In\r\nthat forementioned letter, the Pope highly praises the King's generous\r\ndesign,[49] and recommends to him the civilizing the natives, the\r\nprotection of the Church, and the payment of Peter-pence. The ill\r\nsuccess of all past endeavours to procure from a people so miserable and\r\nirreligious this revenue to the holy see was a main inducement with the\r\nPope to be easy and liberal in his grant; for the King professed a\r\ndesign of securing its regular payment. However, this expedition was not\r\nundertaken until some years after, when there happened an incident to\r\nset it forward, as we shall relate in its place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Radulphus de Diceto.

His\r\nvices: mild and promising in adversity, fierce and hard, and a violator\r\nof faith in prosperity; covetous to his domestics and children, although\r\nliberal to soldiers and strangers, which turned the former from him;\r\nloved profit more than justice; very lustful, which likewise turned his\r\nsons and others from him. Rosamond and the labyrinth at Woodstock. Not\r\nvery religious;[50] _mortuos milites lugens plus quam vivos amans,\r\nlargus in publico, parcus in privato_.

He published, in 1696, \"A View of the\r\nCourt of St. Germains from the Year 1690 to 1695.\" The information\r\nembodied in this work he obtained from personal observation while in\r\nParis. About 1709, however, he aroused the government's suspicions, and\r\nwas imprisoned. He was kept confined until the accession of George I. On\r\nhis release he attempted to establish a packet-service between England\r\nand Ireland, to Dublin; but the venture failed. He died at Rotterdam in\r\n1726. The \"Characters\" was first published in 1733, with the title:\r\n\r\n\"Memoirs of the Secret Services of John Macky, Esq., during the Reigns\r\nof King William, Queen Anne, and King George I. Including also the true\r\nSecret History of the Rise, Promotions, etc., of the English and Scots\r\nNobility; Officers, Civil, Military, Naval, and other Persons of\r\ndistinction from the Revolution. In their respective Characters at\r\nlarge: drawn up by Mr. Macky pursuant to the direction of Her Royal\r\nHighness the Princess Sophia. Published from his original manuscript, as\r\nattested by his son, Spring Macky, Esq. London, 1733.\" The work was\r\nprepared for the press by a Mr. Davis, an officer in the Customs.\r\n\r\nIt has been questioned whether Swift did really make the \"remarks\"\r\nattributed to him by his various editors; but there can be little doubt\r\nabout their authenticity. Thomas Birch seems to have transcribed the\r\n\"remarks\" in 1753, if we are to believe a note in a copy of Macky's book\r\nin the British Museum, which says: \"The MS. notes on the Characters in\r\nthis Book were written by Dr. Swift, and transcribed by Tho. Birch. Aug.\r\n15, 1753.\" Isaac Reed's copy is also in the British Museum, but his\r\nnotes were transcribed from another copy in the possession of J.\r\nPutland, and Putland's copy, Reed notes, was \"formerly in the possession\r\nof Philip Carteret Webb, Esq., now [1770] of Thomas Astle, Esq.\" J.\r\nRitson's copy, which is at the South Kensington Museum, had the\r\n\"remarks\" transcribed to it from Reed's copy, but Ritson notes that Reed\r\ncopied the \"remarks\" from J. Putland's transcript of the Dean's own\r\noriginal. Ritson, however, does not say how he knew that Putland had the\r\n\"Dean's own original.\" In \"Notes and Queries\" (3, ii. 430) the Rev. J.\r\nJebb, Rector of Peterstow, states he had (in 1862) a copy of the\r\n\"Characters\" with transcript of Swift's \"remarks\" by Bishop Jebb. Mr.\r\nEdward Solly has an interesting paper on this matter in the\r\n\"Bibliographer\" for March, 1883. He suggests that Mr. Putland may have\r\nwritten them down himself from remarks made by Swift. \"The Crypt\" for\r\nDecember, 1829, published Swift's \"remarks\" from a copy in the\r\npossession of Mr. Pickering, the bookseller.\r\n\r\nA careful collation of all the available copies has been made for this\r\nedition, and the text of Macky's work has been read with the first\r\nedition. Where neither Reed nor Birch give no remarks, they have been\r\nomitted from this reprint. \"The Crypt\" and Nichols in his quarto edition\r\n(vol. xiv.) often differ, but these differences have been adjusted.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to say that Sir Walter Scott's text and notes have\r\nbeen very much altered by this process.\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS ON THE CHARACTERS\r\n  OF THE COURT OF QUEEN ANNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN, DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH.\r\n\r\n_Macky_.\r\n\r\nA tall, handsome man for his age, with a very obliging address; of a\r\nwonderful presence of mind, so as hardly ever to be discomposed; of a\r\nvery clean head, and sound judgment; ... every way capable of being a\r\ngreat man, if the great success of his arms, and the heaps of favours\r\nthrown upon him by his sovereign, does not raise his thoughts above the\r\nrest of the nobility, and consequently draw upon him the envy of the\r\npeople of England. He is turned of 50 years of age.--_Swift_. Detestably\r\ncovetous.\r\n\r\nJAMES, DUKE OF ORMONDE.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He hath all the qualities of a great man, except that one of a\r\nstatesman, hating business. ... He is about 40 years old.--_Swift_.\r\nFairly enough writ.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, DUKE OF SOMERSET.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is of a middle stature, well shaped, a very black complexion, a\r\nlover of music and poetry; of good judgment.--_Swift_. Not a grain;\r\nhardly common sense.\r\n\r\nJOHN, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE.\r\n\r\n_Macky._ He is a nobleman of learning, and good natural parts, but of no\r\nprinciples. Violent for the high-church, yet seldom goes to it. Very\r\nproud, insolent, and covetous, and takes all advantages. In paying his\r\ndebts, unwilling; and is neither esteemed nor beloved.--_Swift_. This\r\ncharacter is the truest of any.\r\n\r\nDANIEL, EARL OF NOTTINGHAM [AFTERWARDS EARL OF WINCHILSEA].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He hath the exterior air of business, and application enough to\r\nmake him very capable. In his habit and manners very formal; a tall,\r\nthin, very black man, like a Spaniard or Jew, about 50 years\r\nold.--_Swift_. He fell in with the Whigs, was an endless talker.\r\n\r\nHENRY, EARL OF ROMNEY.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He was indeed the great wheel on which the Revolution\r\nrolled.--_Swift_. He had not a wheel to turn a mouse.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a gentleman that hath lived up [_Swift_, down] to the\r\nemployments the King gave him; of great honour and honesty, with a\r\nmoderate capacity.--_Swift_. None at all.\r\n\r\nJOHN, DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He hath one only daughter, who will be the richest heiress in\r\nEurope.--_Swift_. Now Countess of Oxford; cheated by her father.\r\n\r\nCHARLES [LENNOX], DUKE OF RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a gentleman good-natured to a fault; very well bred, and\r\nhath many valuable things in him; is an enemy to business, very\r\ncredulous, well shaped, black complexion, much like King Charles; not 30\r\nyears old.--_Swift_. A shallow coxcomb.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, DUKE OF BOLTON.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Does not now make any figure at court.--_Swift_. Nor anywhere\r\nelse. A great booby.\r\n\r\nGEORGE, DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a man of honour, nice in paying his debts, and living\r\nwell with his neighbours in the country; does not much care for the\r\nconversation of men of quality, or business. Is a tall black man, like\r\nhis father the King, about 40 years old.--_Swift_. He was a most worthy\r\nperson, very good-natured, and had very good sense.\r\n\r\nCHARLES [FITZROY], DUKE OF GRAFTON.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Grandson to King Charles II.; ... a very pretty gentleman, hath\r\nbeen abroad in the world; zealous for the constitution of his country.\r\nA tall black man, about 25 years old.--_Swift_. Almost a slobberer;\r\nwithout one good quality.\r\n\r\nSIR NATHAN WRIGHT, LORD KEEPER.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is son of a clergyman,[1] a good common lawyer, a slow\r\nchancellor, and no civilian. Chance more than choice brought him the\r\nseals.--_Swift_. Very covetous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: His father had the living of Thurcaston, in Leicestershire.\r\n[S.]]\r\n\r\nRALPH, DUKE OF MONTAGU.\r\n\r\n_Macky_.

One of the best beloved gentlemen, by the country party, in\r\nEngland.--_Swift_. A very poor understanding.\r\n\r\nJOHN, LORD SOMERS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Of a creditable family, in the city of Worcester.--_Swift_.\r\nVery mean; his father was a noted rogue.--_Macky_. He is believed to be\r\nthe best chancellor that ever sat in the chair.--_Swift_. I allow him to\r\nhave possessed all excellent qualifications except virtue. He had\r\nviolent passions, and hardly subdued them by his great prudence.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, LORD HALIFAX [AFTERWARDS EARL OF HALIFAX].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a great encourager of learning and learned men, is the\r\npatron of the muses, of very agreeable conversation, a short fair man,\r\nnot 40 years old.--_Swift_. His encouragements were only good words and\r\ndinners; I never heard him say one good thing, or seem to taste what was\r\nsaid by another.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, EARL OF DORSET.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. One of the finest gentlemen, in England, in the reign of King\r\nCharles II.; of great learning [_Swift_. small, or none], extremely\r\nwitty, and hath been the author of some of the finest poems in the\r\nEnglish language, especially satire.... One of the pleasantest\r\ncompanions in the world [_Swift_. not of late years, but a very dull\r\none], when he likes his company.\r\n\r\nRICHARD, EARL RIVERS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He was one of the greatest rakes in England in his younger\r\ndays, but always a lover of the constitution of his country; is a\r\ngentleman of very good sense, and very cunning.--_Swift_.

He was King William's constant companion in all his diversions\r\nand pleasures.--_Swift_. Very infamous pleasures.\r\n\r\nALGERNON, EARL OF ESSEX.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is son to that earl whose throat was cut in the\r\nTower.--_Swift_. Cut his own throat.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, EARL OF PORTLAND.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is supposed to be the richest subject in Europe, very\r\nprofuse in gardening, birds, and household furniture, but mighty frugal\r\nand parsimonious in everything else; of a very lofty mien, and yet not\r\nproud; of no deep understanding.--_Swift_. As great a dunce as ever I\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nJAMES, EARL OF DERBY.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. On his brothers death he came to the House of Peers, where he\r\nnever will make any great figure, the sword being more his profession;\r\nhe is a fair-complexioned man, well shaped, taller than the ordinary\r\nsize, and a man of honour.--_Swift_. As arrant a scoundrel as his\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, EARL OF PETERBOROUGH.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He affects popularity, and loves to preach in coffee-houses,\r\nand public places; is an open enemy to revealed religion; brave in his\r\nperson; hath a good estate; does not seem expensive, yet always in debt,\r\nand very poor.--_Swift_. This character is for the most part true.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, EARL OF SUNDERLAND.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. This gentleman is endued with a great deal of learning, virtue\r\n[_Swift_, no], and good sense.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, EARL OF STAMFORD.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is one of the first branches of the Greys, a noble family in\r\nEngland.... He doth not want sense; but by reason of a defect in his\r\nspeech, wants elocution.--_Swift_.

He is a good country gentleman, a great assertor of the\r\nprerogatives of the monarchy and the Church.--_Swift_. Of great piety\r\nand charity.\r\n\r\nEDWARD [MONTAGU], EARL OF SANDWICH.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Of very ordinary parts; married the witty Lord Rochester's\r\ndaughter, who makes him very expensive.--_Swift_. As much a puppy as\r\never I saw; very ugly, and a fop.\r\n\r\nROBERT, LORD LUCAS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is every way a plain man, yet took a great deal of pains to\r\nseem knowing and wise; everybody pitied him when the Queen turned him\r\nout, for his seeming good nature, and real poverty.--_Swift_. A good\r\nplain humdrum.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, EARL OF WINCHILSEA.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He hath neither genius nor gusto for business,... and is\r\nzealous for the monarchy and Church to the highest degree. He loves\r\njests and puns, [_Swift_. I never observed it,] and that sort of low\r\nwit.--_Swift_. Being very poor, he complied too much with the party he\r\nhated.\r\n\r\nJOHN, LORD POULETT OF HINTON [AFTERWARDS EARL POULETT].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is certainly one of the hopefullest gentlemen in England; is\r\nvery learned, virtuous, and a man of honour; much esteemed in the\r\ncountry, for his generous way of living with the gentry, and his charity\r\nto the poorest sort.--_Swift_. This character is fair enough.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, LORD [VISCOUNT] TOWNSHEND.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is a gentleman of great learning, attended with a sweet\r\ndisposition; a lover of the constitution of his country; is beloved by\r\neverybody that knows him.--_Swift_. I except one.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, LORD DARTMOUTH [AFTERWARDS EARL OF DARTMOUTH].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He sets up for a critic in conversation, makes jests, and loves\r\nto laugh at them; takes a great deal of pains in his office, and is in a\r\nfair way of rising at court.--_Swift_. This is right enough, but he has\r\nlittle sincerity.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, LORD WHARTON [AFTERWARDS EARL OF WHARTON].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. One of the completest gentlemen in England, hath a very clear\r\nunderstanding, and manly expressions, with abundance of wit. He is brave\r\nin his person, much of a libertine, of a middle stature, fair\r\ncomplexion, and 50 years old.--_Swift_. The most universal villain I\r\never knew.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, LORD MOHUN.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is brave in his person, bold in his expressions, and\r\nrectifies, as fast as he can, the slips of his youth by acts of\r\nhonesty; which he now glories in more, than he was formerly\r\nextravagant.--_Swift_. He was little better than a conceited talker in\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nHENRY, EARL OF KENT.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Afterwards Duke of Kent.]\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is the first branch of the ancient family of Grey. The present\r\ngentleman was much esteemed, when Lord Ruthen; was always very moderate,\r\nhas good sense, and a good estate; which, with his quality, must make\r\nhim always bear a considerable figure in the nation.--_Swift_. He seems\r\na good-natured man, but of very little consequence.\r\n\r\nROBERT, EARL OF LINDSEY [AFTERWARDS DUKE OF ANCASTER].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. A fine gentleman, has both wit and learning.--_Swift_.

A gentleman of fine parts, makes a good figure in the counties\r\nof Oxford and Buckinghamshire:... is very high for the monarchy and\r\nChurch.--_Swift_. Very covetous.\r\n\r\nPHILIP, EARL OF CHESTERFIELD.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is very subtle and cunning, never entered into the measures\r\nof King William, nor ever will, in all probability, make any great\r\nappearance in any other reign.--_Swift_. If it be old Chesterfield, I\r\nhave heard he was the greatest knave in England.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, EARL OF BERKELEY.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. A gentleman of learning, parts, and a lover of the constitution\r\nof his country; a short fat man.--_Swift_.

Had very little in him.\r\n\r\nJAMES, LORD CHANDOS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Was warm against King William's reign, and doth not make any\r\ngreat figure in this; but, his son, Mr. Brydges[3] does, being a member\r\nof the House of Commons, one of the counsellors to the prince, and a\r\nvery worthy gentleman.--_Swift_. But a great compiler with every court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Afterwards Duke of Chandos.]\r\n\r\nFRANCIS, LORD GUILFORD.\r\n\r\n_Macky_.

A mighty silly fellow.\r\n\r\nEDWARD, LORD GRIFFIN.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Having-followed King James's fortunes, is now in France. He was\r\nalways a great sportsman, and brave; a good companion, turned of 60\r\nyears old.--_Swift_. His son was a plain drunken fellow.\r\n\r\nHUGH, LORD CHOLMONDELEY [AFTERWARDS EARL OF CHOLMONDELEY].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. This lord is a great lover of country sports; is handsome in\r\nhis person, and turned of 40 years old.--_Swift_. Good for nothing, as\r\nfar as ever I knew.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, LORD BUTLER OF WESTON.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Earl of Arran in Ireland, and brother to the Duke of\r\nOrmonde;... of very good sense, though seldom shows it.--_Swift_. This\r\nis right; but he is the most negligent of his own affairs.\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS MANSELL [AFTERWARDS LORD MANSELL].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a gentleman of a great deal of wit and good nature, a\r\nlover of the ladies, and a pleasant companion.--_Swift_. Of very good\r\nnature, but a very moderate capacity.\r\n\r\nROBERT HARLEY, ESQ. [AFTERWARDS EARL OF OXFORD],\r\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is skilled in most things, and very eloquent, [_Swift_, a\r\ngreat lie;] was bred a Presbyterian, yet joins with the Church party in\r\neverything; and they do nothing without him.--_Swift_. He could not\r\nproperly be called eloquent, but he knew how to prevail on the House\r\nwith few words and strong reasons.\r\n\r\nTHE HON. HENRY BOYLE [AFTERWARDS LORD CARLETON],\r\nCHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is a good companion in conversation; agreeable amongst the\r\nladies; serves the Queen very assiduously in council; makes a\r\nconsiderable figure in the House of Commons; by his prudent\r\nadministration, obliges everybody in the exchequer; and in time may\r\nprove a great man.--_Swift_. He had some very scurvy qualities,\r\nparticularly avarice.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS FRANKLAND, POST-MASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a gentleman of a very sweet, easy, affable disposition;\r\nof good sense, extremely zealous for the constitution of his country,\r\nyet does not seem over forward; keeps an exact unity amongst the\r\nofficers under him, and encourages them in their duty, through a\r\npeculiar familiarity, by which he obliges them, and keeps up the dignity\r\nof being master.--_Swift_. A fair character.\r\n\r\nTHE RT. HON. JOHN SMITH,\r\nONE OF HER MAJESTY'S PRIVY-COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. A gentleman of much honour, a lover of the constitution of his\r\ncountry; a very agreeable companion in conversation, a bold orator in\r\nthe House of Commons,[4] when the interest of his country is at stake;\r\nof a good address.--_Swift_. I thought him a heavy man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: He was Speaker of the House of Commons, 1705-1708. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nCHARLES D'AVENANT, LL.D.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He was very poor at the Revolution, had no business to support\r\nhim all the reign of King William, yet made a good figure. He is a very\r\ncloudy-looked man, fat, of middle stature, about 50 years old.--_Swift_.\r\nHe was used ill by most ministries; he ruined his own estate, which put\r\nhim under a necessity to comply with the times.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW PRIOR, ESQ., COMMISSIONER OF TRADE.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. On the Queen's accession to the throne, he was continued in his\r\noffice, is very well at court with the ministry, and is an entire\r\ncreature of my Lord Jersey's, whom he supports by his advice.

BISHOP OF SALISBURY.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Of a very good family in Scotland, of the name of Burnet, his\r\nfather was Lord [_Swift_, laird] of Cremont.... He is one of the\r\ngreatest [_Swift_, Scotch] orators of the age he lives in. His \"History\r\nof the Reformation,\" and his \"Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles,\"\r\nshow him to be a man of great learning; but several of his other works\r\nshow him to be a man neither of prudence nor temper; his sometimes\r\nopposing, and sometimes favouring, the Dissenters, hath much exposed him\r\nto the generality of the people of England; yet he is very useful in the\r\nHouse of Peers, and proves a great pillar, both of the civil and\r\necclesiastical constitution, against the encroachments of a party which\r\nwould destroy both.--_Swift_. His true character would take up too much\r\ntime for me (who knew him well) to describe it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE STEPNEY, ESQ.,\r\nENVOY EXTRAORDINARY TO THE EMPEROR [OF AUSTRIA].\r\n\r\n_Macky_.

[AFTERWARDS SIR PAUL] METHUEN,\r\nAMBASSADOR TO THE KING OF PORTUGAL.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. A man of intrigue, but very muddy in his conceptions, and not\r\nquickly understood in anything. In his complexion and manners, much of a\r\nSpaniard.--_Swift_. A profligate rogue, without religion or morals; but\r\ncunning enough, yet without abilities of any kind.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, LORD RABY [AFTERWARDS EARL OF STRAFFORD],\r\nENVOY EXTRAORDINARY TO THE KING OF PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a young gentleman, _de bon naturel_, handsome, of fine\r\nunderstanding, [_Swift_, very bad, and can't spell,] and, with\r\napplication, may prove a man of business. He is of low stature [_Swift_,\r\nhe is tall].\r\n\r\nMR. [RICHARD] HILL,\r\nENVOY EXTRAORDINARY TO THE DUKE OF SAVOY.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Is a gentleman of a good family in Shropshire. He was designed\r\nfor the church, and took deacon's [_Swift_, priest's] orders; but having\r\na genius for business, and falling into the acquaintance of my Lord\r\nRanelagh, when tutor to my Lord Hyde, he was sent into Flanders as\r\npaymaster to the English troops there. ... He is a gentleman of very\r\nclear parts, and affects plainness and simplicity [_Swift, au\r\ncontraire_] in his dress, and conversation especially. He is a favourite\r\nto both parties [_Swift_, to neither]; and is beloved for his easy\r\naccess, and affable way by those he has business to do with. He is a\r\nthin, tall man, [_Swift,_ short, if I remember right,] taller than the\r\nordinary stature, near 50 years old.\r\n\r\nSIR LAMBERT BLACKWELL,\r\nENVOY TO THE GREAT DUKE OF TUSCANY.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He affects much the gentleman in his dress, and the minister in\r\nhis conversation: Is very lofty, yet courteous, when he knows his\r\npeople; much envied by his fellow merchants.--_Swift_. He seemed to be\r\na very good-natured man.\r\n\r\nMR. _[Dr.]_ AGLIONBY,\r\nENVOY TO THE SWISS CANTONS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He hath abundance of wit, and understands most of the modern\r\nlanguages well; knows how to tell a story to the best advantage; but has\r\nan affected manner of conversation; is thin, splenetic, and tawny\r\ncomplexioned, turned of 60 years old.--_Swift_. He had been a Papist.\r\n\r\nMR. D'AVENANT, AGENT AT FRANKFORT.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. A very giddy-headed young fellow, with some wit; about 25 years\r\nold.--_Swift_. He is not worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nJOHN, LORD CUTTS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He hath abundance of wit, but too much seized with vanity and\r\nself-conceit; he is affable, familiar, and very brave;  ... towards 50\r\nyears old.--_Swift_. The vainest old fool alive.\r\n\r\nHENRY, EARL OF GALWAY.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. One of the finest gentlemen in the army, with a head fitted for\r\nthe cabinet, as well as the camp; is very modest, vigilant, and sincere;\r\na man of honour and honesty, [_Swift_, in all directly otherwise;]\r\nwithout pride or affectation; wears his own hair, is plain in his dress\r\nand manners, towards 60 years old.--_Swift_.

He is a very well-shaped black man; is brave; but, by reason of\r\na hesitation in his speech wants expression.--_Swift_.

JAMES STANHOPE [AFTERWARDS EARL STANHOPE],\r\nENVOY EXTRAORDINARY TO THE STATES GENERAL.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a man of honour,... and pleases the Dutch. His son,\r\nColonel Stanhope, is one of the finest young gentlemen we have; is very\r\nlearned, with a great deal of wit. ... A handsome [_Swift_, ugly] black\r\nman.\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES O'HARA [AFTERWARDS LORD TYRAWLEY],\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. At the Revolution he had a company in the foot-guards; was\r\nafterwards lieutenant-colonel to that regiment; was made colonel to the\r\nfusileers, and gradually advanced to the post he now hath, which he well\r\ndeserves, being of good understanding, and abundance of learning; fit to\r\ncommand, if not too covetous; he is a short, black man, 50 years\r\nold.--_Swift_. His father was a groom; he was a man of sense, without\r\none grain of honesty.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL MATTHEW AYLMER [AFTERWARDS LORD AYLMER],\r\nVICE-ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET.\r\n\r\n_Macky_.

He was made\r\nmaster of the ordnance; a worthy good-natured person, very generous, but\r\nof a middle understanding; he was murdered by that villain Macartney, an\r\nIrish Scot.\r\n\r\nARCHIBALD, DUKE OF ARGYLL.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Few of his years hath a better understanding, nor a more manly\r\nbehaviour. He hath seen most of the courts of Europe, is very handsome\r\nin his person, fair complexioned; about 25 years old.--_Swift_.\r\nAmbitious, covetous, cunning Scot; has no principle, but his own\r\ninterest and greatness. A true Scot in his whole conduct.\r\n\r\nJAMES, MARQUESS OF MONTROSE [AFTERWARDS DUKE OF MONTROSE].\r\n\r\n_Macky_. Representative of the ancient and noble family of Graham;\r\ngreat-grandson to that famous Montrose, who was hanged and quartered for\r\nCharles I.; and grandson, by the mother, to the Duke of Rothes. He\r\ninherits all the great qualities of those two families, with a sweetness\r\nof behaviour, which charms all those who know him; hath improved himself\r\nin most foreign courts; is very beautiful in his person, and about 25\r\nyears old.--_Swift_.

[WILLIAM] CARSTAIRS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is the cunningest, subtle dissembler in the world, with an\r\nair of sincerity, a dangerous enemy, because always hid. An instance of\r\nwhich was Secretary Johnstoun, to whom he pretended friendship, till the\r\nvery morning he gave him a blow, though he had been worming him\r\nout of the King's favour for many months before; he is a fat,\r\nsanguine-complexioned fair man, always smiling, where he designs most\r\nmischief, a good friend when he is sincere; turned of 50 years\r\nold.--_Swift_. A true character; but not strong enough by a fiftieth\r\npart.\r\n\r\nJOHN, EARL OF MAR.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is a very good manager in his private affairs, which were in\r\ndisorder when his father died, and is a stanch countryman, fair\r\ncomplexioned, low stature, and 30 years old.--_Swift_.

He hath written some excellent\r\ntracts, but not published in his name; and hath a very fine genius; is a\r\nlow, thin man, brown complexion, full of fire, with a stern, sour look,\r\nand 50 years old.--_Swift_. A most arrogant, conceited pedant in\r\npolitics; cannot endure the least contradiction in any of his visions or\r\nparadoxes.\r\n\r\nCHARLES, EARL OF MIDDLETON.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He is one of the politest gentlemen in Europe; hath a great\r\ndeal of wit, mixed with a sound judgment, and a very clear\r\nunderstanding; of an easy, indifferent access, but a careless way of\r\nliving. ... He is a black man, of a middle stature, with a sanguine\r\ncomplexion; and one of the pleasantest companions in the world. Towards\r\n60 years old.--_Swift_. Sir William Temple told me, he was a very\r\nvaluable man, and a good scholar. I once saw him.\r\n\r\nDAVID, EARL OF WEEMS.\r\n\r\n_Macky_. He hath not yet been in the administration; is a fine\r\npersonage, and very beautiful; hath good sense, and is a man of honour.\r\nAbout 30 years old.--_Swift_.

PATRICK'S LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe text of this edition of Swift's notes on Clarendon has been founded\r\non the careful transcript made by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald. This transcript\r\nis now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington. Mr.\r\nFitzgerald refers to Dr. Rowan's collation, but I have been unable to\r\nfind the original of this. Rowan's additions, however, were noted by Mr.\r\nFitzgerald, and they have been included here. Mr. Fitzgerald says:\r\n\"Scott's notes, subject to the corrections just given [by himself], are\r\ncorrect, and would serve as the base of the new edition. The additions I\r\nhave given and the few given by Dr. Rowan (which are given here a little\r\nfurther on) will have to be inserted in their proper places and will\r\nmake the whole complete.\" This has been done, and the present reprint is\r\na very careful following out of this suggestion.\r\n\r\nAfter the following pages were in type, however, I have had the\r\nopportunity, through the kindness of Dr. Bernard, the Dean of St.\r\nPatrick's Cathedral, of examining the original copy in the Marsh Library\r\nat Dublin. Assisted by the Rev. Newport J.D. White, the librarian of\r\nthe Marsh Library, I have been able to correct several of Mr. Percy\r\nFitzgerald's transcripts, and to add some \"remarks\" omitted both by him\r\nand Scott.\r\n\r\nMr. White, in an article in \"Hermathena\" (No. xxvii., 1901), suggests\r\nthat the successive perusals by Swift account \"for the fact that some of\r\nthe notes are in ink, though most are in pencil; while in one or two\r\ncases Swift seems to have retraced in ink a remark originally in\r\npencil.\" Although Swift finished his fourth reading of the \"History\" in\r\n1741, it is undoubted that he had already annotated the volumes at a\r\nmuch earlier date. The copy of the \"History,\" now in the Marsh Library,\r\nwas presented to it by Archbishop King, though the exact date of this\r\npresentation can only be guessed. \"In the register of benefactions,\"\r\nwrites Mr. White in \"Hermathena,\" \"the first list, which was evidently\r\nwritten at one time and by one hand, contains the names of all books\r\npresented by King. Two of these were published as late as 1723. The next\r\nentry is dated April 12th, 1726. It is probable, therefore, that these\r\nvolumes came into their present abode between 1723 and 1726. As Dean of\r\nSt. Patrick's, Swift was one of the governors of the library, and in\r\nthat capacity attended many of the annual visitations between 1718 and\r\n1736. It is natural to suppose that he was a constant reader.\" It\r\nfollows, therefore, that Swift borrowed the volumes from the library for\r\nhis re-perusal; and perhaps retraced his annotations at that time and\r\nadded new ones.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to reprint a sentence from Scott's note on these\r\n\"Remarks\" of Swift's, if only to continue a record of retort against\r\nSwift's intemperance of feeling against the Scottish nation: \"The\r\nludicrous virulence of his execrations against the Scottish nation, go a\r\ngreat way to remove the effect of his censure; and a native of Scotland\r\nmay be justified in retaining them, were it but for that reason.\"\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS ON CLARENDON'S\r\n  HISTORY OF THE\r\n  REBELLION.\r\n\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first board: Finished the 4th time, April 18, 1741. Judicium de\r\nauthore.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 1  The note \"Finished the 4th time April 18, 1741,\" which\r\nScott and Fitzgerald record as written on the first board of vol. i., is\r\nnot now to be traced, the volume having been rebound since their\r\ntranscripts were made.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cursed, hellish villainy, treachery, treasons of the Scots, were the\r\nchief grounds and causes of that execrable rebellion.--_Swift_.\r\n\r\n\"The word of a king.\" This phrase is repeated some hundred times; but is\r\never foolish, and too often false.--_Swift_.\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nP. v. [p. xxi.[2]] _Clarendon_. We might give instances ... of those\r\npoints ... which have brought the prince, sometimes, under the\r\ndisadvantageous suspicion of being inclined to the love of arbitrary\r\npower.--_Swift_. What king doth not love, and endeavour at it?\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 2  The references in square brackets apply to the recent\r\nOxford edition of Clarendon's \"Rebellion\" (6 vols., cr. 8vo, 1888).

The people may not always be restrained\r\nfrom attempting by force to do themselves right, though they ought\r\nnot.--_Swift_. They _ought!_\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nP. 9. [par. 12.] _Clarendon_. All men being inhibited, by the\r\nproclamation at the dissolution of the Parliament in the fourth year, so\r\nmuch as to mention or speak as if a Parliament should be\r\ncalled.--_Swift_. Great weakness.\r\n\r\nP. 47. [par. 128.] _Clarendon_. He [the Earl of Montgomery] had not sat\r\nmany years in that sunshine, when a new comet appeared in court, Robert\r\nCarr, a Scotsman, quickly after declared favourite.--_Swift_. A Scottish\r\nking makes a Scottish favourite.\r\n\r\nP. 48. [par. 133.] _Clarendon_. The Earl of Carlisle ... wrought himself\r\ninto ... greater affection and esteem with the whole English nation,\r\nthan any other of that country; by choosing their friendships, and\r\nconversation, and really preferring it to any of his own--_Swift_. A\r\nmiracle in a Scot!\r\n\r\nP. 58. [par. 159.] _Clarendon_. During the whole time that these\r\npressures were exercised, and those new, and extraordinary ways were\r\nrun, that is, from the dissolution of the Parliament in the fourth year,\r\nto the beginning of this Parliament, which was above twelve years, this\r\nkingdom ... enjoyed the greatest calm, and the fullest measure of\r\nfelicity, that any people in any age, for so long time together, have\r\nbeen blessed with.--_Swift_. Partial.\r\n\r\nP. 59. [par. 162.] _Clarendon_. The kingdoms, we now lament, were alone\r\nlooked upon as the garden of the world; Scotland (which was but the\r\nwilderness of that garden), etc.--_Swift_. The _dunghill!_\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [par. 163.] _Clarendon_. Those rough courses, which made him\r\n[the King] perhaps less loved at home, made him more feared abroad; by\r\nhow much the power of kingdoms is more reverenced than their justice by\r\ntheir neighbours: and it may be this consideration might not be the\r\nleast motive, and may not be the worst excuse for those\r\ncounsels.--_Swift_ Too arbitrary.\r\n\r\nP. 60. [par. 163.] _Clarendon_. Nerva was deified for uniting, _Imperium\r\net Libertas_.--_Swift_. \"Libertas\" underlined and \"_nego_\" written in\r\nthe margin.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 165.] _Clarendon_. Wise men knew that that which looked\r\nlike pride in some, would, etc. [Swift places a condemnatory pencil mark\r\nbeneath \"that.\"]\r\n\r\nP. 75. [par. 201.] _Clarendon_. A book so full of good learning,[3] [_i\r\ne.,_ Bp. John Williams (of Lincoln) against Innovations in\r\nReligion].--_Swift_. Is that book to be bought or borrowed?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Again referred to on p. 271. _See_ Scott's note _in loco_\r\n(p. 297). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nP. 88. [par. 18.] _Clarendon_. There was so little curiosity either in\r\nthe court, or the country, to know anything of Scotland, or what was\r\ndone there, that when the whole nation was solicitous to know what\r\npassed weekly in Germany, and Poland, and all other parts of Europe, no\r\nman ever enquired what was doing in Scotland, nor had that kingdom a\r\nplace or mention in one page of any gazette.--_Swift_. Should Bridewell\r\nnews be in any gazette?\r\n\r\nP.88. [par 18.] _Clarendon_. The people [the Scotch] after they had once\r\nbegun, pursued the business vigorously, and with all imaginable contempt\r\nof the government.--_Swift_. Scottish scoundrels!\r\n\r\nP. 94. [par. 38.] _Clarendon_ in the address of the Scots to the\r\nKing:--Lamenting \"their ill fortune that their enemies had so great\r\ncredit with the King, as to persuade him to believe that they were or\r\ncould be disobedient to him, a thing that could never enter into their\r\nloyal hearts.\"--_Swift_. Scotch dogs!\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 39.] _Clarendon_. Into Scotland ... as far as a place\r\ncalled Dunce.--_Swift_. \"Dunce\" underlined.\r\n\r\nP. 95. [par. 42.] _Clarendon_. The Covenanters ... were very reasonably\r\nexalted with this success, [the retreat of the Earl of Holland from\r\nDunse,] and scattered their letters abroad amongst the noblemen at\r\ncourt, according to the humours of the men to whom they writ.--_Swift_.\r\nCursed Scots for ever!\r\n\r\nP. 96. [par. 46.] _Clarendon_, speaking of the Marquess of\r\nHamilton.--_Swift_. A cursed true Scot!\r\n\r\nP. 100. [par. 55] _Clarendon_ The Scots got so much benefit and\r\nadvantage by it [the treaty of pacification], that they brought all\r\ntheir other mischievous devices to pass, with ease.--_Swift_. Confounded\r\nScots!\r\n\r\nP. 101. [par. 58.] Marginal note to Clarendon: The Earl of Argyle joins\r\nwith the Covenanters, notwithstanding his great obligations to the\r\nKing.--_Swift_. All Argyles, cursed Scottish hell-hounds for ever!\r\n\r\nP. 103. [par. 60.] _Clarendon_, on the letter from the Scotch nobility\r\nto the French King, which was intercepted, and upon Lord Lowden, in his\r\nexamination:--refusing to give any other answer, than that it was writ\r\nbefore the agreement ... and never sent; that if he had committed any\r\noffence, he ought to be questioned for it in Scotland, and not in\r\nEngland.--_Swift_. Scottish traitors!\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 61.] _Clarendon_. The opinion of the prejudice and general\r\naversion over the whole kingdom to the Scots, and the indignation they\r\nhad at their presumption in their design of invading England, made it\r\nbelieved that a Parliament would express a very sharp sense of their\r\ninsolence and carriage towards the King.--_Swift_. Cursed hellish Scots\r\nfor ever!\r\n\r\nP. 104. [par. 62.] _Clarendon_, on the calling together of the\r\nParliament in 1640:--The King ... directed the lord-keeper to issue out\r\nwrits for the meeting of a Parliament upon the third day of April then\r\nnext ensuing.--_Swift_. April 3d for knaves; the 1st for fools!\r\n\r\nP. 114. [par, 90.] _Clarendon_. The Scots army ... were always\r\nbeaten.--_Swift_. \"Always beaten\" trebly underlined.\r\n\r\nP. 116. [par. 97.] _Clarendon_ The convocation-house (the regular and\r\nlegal assembling of the clergy) customarily beginning and ending with\r\nParliaments, was, after the determination of the last, by a new writ\r\ncontinued.--_Swift_. Convocations of the clergy are as legal and as\r\nnecessary as those of the laity.\r\n\r\nP. 122. [par 108.] _Clarendon_, on the commissioners who met at\r\nRipon:--When these commissioners from the King arrived at Ripon, there\r\ncame others from the Scots army of a quality much inferior--_Swift_. A\r\ncursed committee!\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 108.] _Clarendon_. Alexander Henderson.--_Swift_. A cursed\r\nfanatic! (Written in pencil, and partially rubbed out.)\r\n\r\nP. 123. [par. 109.] _Clarendon_. There was not a man of all the English,\r\netc.--_Swift_. Cursed hellish Scots!\r\n\r\nP. 124. [par. 111.] _Clarendon_. They brought them with them and\r\npresented them to the King [Swift underscores _them_.]\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 113.] _Clarendon_. Three of the commissioners, and no\r\nmore, were of the King's council, the Earls of Pembroke, Salisbury, and\r\nHolland.--_Swift_. Bad counsellors.\r\n\r\nP. 125. [par. 116.] _Clarendon_ The commissioners at Ripon quickly\r\nagreed upon the cessation; and were not unwilling to have allowed fifty\r\nthousand pounds a month for the support of the Scots army, when they did\r\nassign but thirty thousand pounds a month for the payment of the\r\nKing's.--_Swift_. Greedy Scotch rebellious dogs.\r\n\r\nP. 129. [par. 126.] _Clarendon_. It must not be doubted that there were\r\nmany particular persons of honour of that nation who abhorred the\r\noutrages which were committed.--_Swift_. I doubt it; for they were\r\nScots.\r\n\r\nP. 130. [par. 128.] _Clarendon_. It can hardly be conceived, with what\r\nentire confidence in each other, the numerous and _not very rich_\r\nnobility of Scotland ... concurred in the carrying on this\r\nrebellion.--_Swift_. Beggarly, beggarly!\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nP. 148. [par. 32.] _Clarendon_. Mr. Saint-John ... a natural son of the\r\nhouse of Bullingbrook.--_Swift_. A bastard.\r\n\r\nP. 151. [par. 38.] _Clarendon_. The Earl of Rothes ... was a man very\r\nwell bred, of very good parts, and great address.--_Swift_. A Scotch\r\nfreethinker.\r\n\r\nP. 152. [par. 42.] _Clarendon_, on the order of the Houses of\r\nParliament, to use the appellation of \"our brethren of Scotland\" towards\r\nthe Scotch commissioners.--_Swift_ Cursed Scots, brethren in iniquity.\r\n\r\nP. 153 [par 44] _Clarendon_ The allegation was, \"That the charge against\r\nthe Earl of Stafford was of an extraordinary nature, being to make a\r\ntreason evident out of a complication of several ill acts, That he must\r\nbe traced through many dark paths,\" etc.--_Swift._ As a boy.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_ [par 45] _Clarendon_ It was alleged, \"That at his coming from\r\nIreland the Earl had said in council there, That if ever he returned to\r\nthat sword again, he would not leave a Scottishman in that\r\nkingdom\".--_Swift_ And it was a good resolution.\r\n\r\nP 153 [par 45] _Clarendon_ ---- \"And at his arrival in this kingdom, the\r\nlord mayor and some aldermen of London attending the board about the\r\nloan of moneys, and not giving that satisfaction was expected, that he\r\nshould  tell the King, That it would never be well till he hanged up a\r\nLord Mayor of London in the City to terrify the rest\".--_Swift_ At\r\nworst, only a rash expression.\r\n\r\nP 155 [par 50] _Clarendon_ Hereupon, in one day, were sworn privy\r\ncouncillors, much to the public joy, the Earl of Hertford (whom the King\r\nafterwards made marquess), the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, the\r\nEarl of Bristol, the Lord Say, the Lord Saville, and the Lord Kimbolton,\r\nand within two or three days after, the Earl of Warwick.--_Swift_ All\r\n[_rogues,_ perhaps,[4]] but the first.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 4 P Fitzgerald says _[sworn,_ more likely] [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nP 161 [par 67] _Clarendon_, on the method of procuring signatures to one\r\npetition, and then cutting them off, and affixing them to a petition of\r\nquite a different tendency.--_Swift_ Dogs, villains, almost as bad as\r\nthe cursed Scots.\r\n\r\nP 366 [par 85] _Clarendon_ The Earl of Bedford prevailed with the King\r\n... to make Oliver Saint-John ... his solicitor-general, which His\r\nMajesty readily consented to: ... being a gentleman of an honourable\r\nextraction (if he had been legitimate).--_Swift_ The bastard before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nP 183 [par 140] _Clarendon_, trial of Strafford--Mr Solicitor Saint-John\r\n... argued for the space of near an hour the matter of law. Of the\r\nargument itself I shall say little, it being in print, and in many\r\nhands, I shall only remember two notable propositions, which are\r\nsufficient characters of the person and the time.--_Swift_ Bp.\r\nA[tterbury]\r\n\r\nP 187 [par 156] _Clarendon_, on the bill for extirpating bishops, deans,\r\nand chapters, etc.--Though the rejecting it, was earnestly urged by very\r\nmany, ... yet, all the other people, as violently pressed the reading\r\nit; and none so importunately, as Saint-John.--_Swift_. The bastard!\r\n\r\nP. 195. [par. 179.] _Clarendon_. It being always their custom, when they\r\nfound the heat and distemper of the House (which they endeavoured to\r\nkeep up, by the sharp mention and remembrance of former grievances and\r\npressures) in any degree allayed, by some gracious act, or gracious\r\nprofession of the King's, to warm and inflame them again with a\r\ndiscovery, or promise of a discovery, of some notable plot and\r\nconspiracy against themselves.--_Swift._ King George I.'s reign.\r\n\r\nP. 199. [par. 189.] _Clarendon_. Whereas some doubts, etc.--_Swift_.\r\nTrue Popish evasion.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Clarendon_, on the explanation of the Protestation for the Church\r\nof England:--concerning the meaning of these words  ... \"_viz_ The true\r\nreformed Protestant religion, expressed in the doctrine of the Church of\r\nEngland, against all Popery and Popish innovations within this realm,\r\ncontrary to the same doctrine,\" This House doth declare, that by those\r\nwords, was and is meant, only the public doctrine professed in the said\r\nChurch, so far as it is opposite to Popery, etc.--_Swift_. Fanatic dogs!\r\n\r\nP. 202. [par. 198.] _Clarendon_. The Archbishop of York.--_Swift_.\r\nWilliams, before of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 200.] _Clarendon_, on the letter of Strafford to the King,\r\npersuading him no longer to delay the order for his execution.--_Swift_.\r\nGreat magnanimity!\r\n\r\nP. 203. [par. 201.] _Clarendon_. The delivery of this letter being\r\nquickly known, new arguments were applied; \"that this free consent of\r\nhis own, clearly absolved the King from any scruple that could remain\r\nwith him.\"--_Swift_. Weak, and wrong.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 202.] _Clarendon_. There was reason enough to believe,\r\ntheir impious hands would be lifted up against his own person, and\r\n(which he much more apprehended) against the person of his royal\r\nconsort.--_Swift_. A most unhappy marriage.\r\n\r\nP. 204. [par. 206.] _Clarendon_. Together with that of attainder of the\r\nEarl of Strafford, another Bill was passed by the King, of almost as\r\nfatal a consequence both to the King and kingdom,  ... \"the Act for the\r\nperpetual Parliament;\" as it is since called.--_Swift_. Cursed\r\nstupidity! _Hinc illae lachrymae_.\r\n\r\nP. 205. [par. 207.] _Clarendon_. No way could be thought of so sure, as\r\nan Act of Parliament, \"that this Parliament should not be adjourned,\r\nprorogued, or dissolved, but by Act of Parliament, which, upon this\r\noccasion, His Majesty would never deny to pass.\"--_Swift_. The fatal\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 210.] _Clarendon_, on the King's passing this Bill.\r\n--_Swift_. I wish the author had enlarged here upon what motives the\r\nKing passed that Bill.\r\n\r\nP 205 [par 210] _Clarendon_, on the same.--_Swift_ The King by this act\r\nutterly ruined.\r\n\r\nP 207 [par 217] _Clarendon_, on the passing of the tonnage and poundage\r\nbill--And so in expectation and confidence, that they would make\r\nglorious additions to the state and revenue of the crown, His Majesty\r\nsuffered himself to be stripped of all that he had left.--_Swift_ Great\r\nweakness in the King.\r\n\r\nP 225 [par 271] _Clarendon_ These Acts of Parliament, etc will be\r\nacknowledged, by an uncorrupted posterity, to be everlasting monuments\r\nof the King's princely and fatherly affection to his people.--_Swift_\r\nRather of his weakness.\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nP 237 [par 24] _Clarendon_ A general insurrection of the Irish, spread\r\nitself over the whole country, in such an inhumane and barbarous manner,\r\nthat there were forty or fifty thousand of the English Protestants\r\nmurdered.--_Swift_ At least.\r\n\r\nP 243 [par 43] _Clarendon_ That which should have been an act of\r\noblivion, was made a defence and justification of whatsoever they [the\r\nScotch] had done.--_Swift_ Scot, Scot, Scot, for ever Scot.\r\n\r\nP 244 [par 47] _Clarendon_ His Majesty having never received any\r\nconsiderable profit from Scotland, etc.--_Swift_ How could he, from\r\nScottish rebels and beggars?\r\n\r\nP 245 [par 47] _Clarendon_ Surely he had then very hard thoughts of a\r\ngreat part of the nation [the Scotch].--_Swift_ Who can doubt of it?\r\n\r\nP 257 [par 87] _Clarendon_ The propositions made from Scotland, \"for the\r\nsending ten thousand men from thence, into Ulster, to be paid by the\r\nParliament,\" were consented to, whereby some soldiers were dispatched\r\nthither, to defend their own plantation, and did in truth, at our\r\ncharge, as much oppress the English that were there, as the rebels could\r\nhave done.--_Swift_ Send cursed rebel Scots, who oppressed the English\r\nin that kingdom as the Irish rebels did, and were governors of that\r\nprovince, etc.\r\n\r\nP 271 [par 130] _Clarendon_, Doctor Williams, Archbishop of York--had\r\nhimself published, by his own authority, a book against the using those\r\nceremonies [which were countenanced by Laud], in which there was much\r\ngood learning, and too little gravity for a bishop.--_Swift_ Where is\r\nthat book to be had?[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The book is extant, and was written in answer to Dr Heyhn's\r\n\"Coal from the Altar\". Even the title page contains a punning allusion\r\nto his adversary's work, rather too facetious for the subject of his\r\nown. It is entitled \"The Holy Table, name and thing, more anciently,\r\nproperly, and literally used under the New Testament, than that of\r\nAltar.\"]\r\n\r\nP. 272. [par. 130.] _Clarendon_, Archbishop Williams:--appeared to be a\r\nman of a very corrupt nature, whose passions could have transported him\r\ninto the most unjustifiable actions.--_Swift._ This character I think\r\ntoo severe.\r\n\r\nP. 275. [par. 138.] _Clarendon_, the same:--The great hatred of this\r\nman's person and behaviour, was the greatest invitation to the House of\r\nCommons so irregularly to revive that Bill to remove the\r\nbishops.--_Swift_. How came he to be so hated by that faction he is so\r\nsaid to favour?\r\n\r\nP. 277. [par. 140.] _Clarendon_, petition and protestation of the\r\nbishops.--_Swift_. I see no fault in this protestation.\r\n\r\nP. 280. [par. 149.] _Clarendon_, on the articles of high treason against\r\nLord Kimbolton, Pym, Hampden, Hollis, Haslerigg, and Strode.--_Swift_.\r\nIt proved a long and vexatious affair.\r\n\r\nP. 281. [par. 152.] _Clarendon_. The next day in the afternoon, the King\r\n... came to the House of Commons.... Himself, with his nephew, the\r\nPrince Elector, went into the House, to the great amazement of\r\nall.--_Swift._ Too rash and indiscreet; the second great and fatal\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nP. 282. [par. 152.] _Clarendon_. He assured them in the word of a King,\r\netc.--_Swift_. Never to be relied upon.\r\n\r\nP. 284. [par. 157.] _Clarendon_. The King ... published, the next day, a\r\nproclamation, for the apprehension of all those, whom he had accused of\r\nhigh treason, forbidding any person to harbour them; the articles of\r\ntheir charge being likewise printed, and dispersed.--_Swift_. A very\r\nweak and wrong proceeding in the King, which had very bad consequences.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Clarendon_, on the same proceeding.--_Swift_. What was their\r\ncrime?\r\n\r\nP. 322. [par. 264.] _Clarendon_. The humble petition of many thousands\r\nof poor people in and about the city of London.--_Swift._ Who was the\r\nauthor?\r\n\r\nP. 334. [par. 302.] _Clarendon_, on the King's passing the bills against\r\nthe bishops' votes, and about pressing.--_Swift_. Too great a weakness,\r\nand attended by a heap of gross follies.\r\n\r\nP. 336. [par. 307.] _Clarendon_, on:--An Ordinance of both Houses of\r\nParliament for the ordering of the Militia of the kingdom of England,\r\nand dominion of Wales.--_Swift_. The most ruinous consequence of the\r\nKing's weakness and cowardice.\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nP. 364. [par. 6.] _Clarendon,_ in the King's Declaration, March 9,\r\n164-1/2:--For the Lord Digby, he assured them in the word of a King,\r\netc.--_Swift_. I cannot endure that phrase any more.\r\n\r\nWritten long ago by a minister in Lincolnshire, in answer to D. Coal, a\r\njudicious divine of Q. Marie's dayes. 1637. [S.]\r\n\r\nP. 365. [par. 9.] _Clarendon_, in the same:--What greater earnest of his\r\ntrust, and reliance on his Parliament could he give, than the passing\r\nthe Bill for the continuance of this present Parliament?--_Swift_. Like\r\na very weak prince.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Clarendon_, in the same:--The length of which [Parliament] he\r\nsaid, he hoped, would never alter the nature of Parliaments, and the\r\nconstitution of this kingdom; or invite his subjects so much to abuse\r\nhis confidence, as to esteem anything fit for this Parliament to do,\r\nwhich were not fit, if it were in his power to dissolve it\r\nto-morrow.--_Swift_. Yet, that was his ruin.\r\n\r\nP. 366. [par. 11.] _Clarendon_. The factious party [persuaded the\r\npeople] ... that there was a design to send the prince beyond the seas,\r\nand to marry him to some Papist.--_Swift_. As it fell out.\r\n\r\nP. 384. [par. 56.] _Clarendon_, in the King's answer to the petition to\r\nremove the magazine from Hull:--We have ... most solemnly promised, in\r\nthe word of a king, etc.--_Swift_. How long is that phrase to last?\r\n\r\nP. 415. [par. 136] _Clarendon_. Whoever concurred, voted, and sided with\r\nthem, in their extravagant conclusions, let the infamy of his former\r\nlife, or present practice be what it would; his injustice and oppression\r\nnever so scandalous, and notorious; he was received, countenanced, and\r\nprotected with marvellous demonstrations of affection.--_Swift_. King\r\nGeorge's reign.\r\n\r\nP. 419. [par. 148.] _Clarendon_, in the King's answer to the petition to\r\ndissolve his Guards:--He asked them, \"when they had so many months\r\ntogether not contented themselves to rely for security, as their\r\npredecessors had done, upon the affection of the people, but by their\r\nown single authority had raised to themselves a guard ... and yet all\r\nthose pikes and protestations, that army, on one side, and that navy, on\r\nthe other, had not persuaded His Majesty to command them to disband\r\ntheir forces,\" etc.--_Swift_. What are those pikes?\r\n\r\nP. 427. [par. 162.] _Clarendon_, in the Declaration of the Lords and\r\nCommons, May 19, 1642--That, in the word of a King, _etc.--Swift._ A\r\nfrequent foolish word, battered as a phrase.\r\n\r\nP. 472. [par. 269.] _Clarendon_. He divested himself of the power of\r\ndissolving this Parliament.--_Swift_. Proved his ruin.\r\n\r\nP. 543. [par. 425.] _Clarendon_, on the deposition of Sir Richard\r\nGurney, lord mayor.--_Swift_ Dogs!\r\n\r\nVOL. II.--BOOK VI.\r\n\r\nP. 7. [par. 11.] _Clarendon_, Message of the King, Aug. 25th,\r\n1642:--\"Wherein, as we promise, in the word of a King, all safety and\r\nencouragement to such as shall be sent unto us ... for the\r\ntreaty.\"--_Swift_. Very weak.\r\n\r\nP. 10. [par. 18.] _Clarendon_, answer of the Parliament to the King's\r\nmessage received the 5th of September, 1642.--_Swift._ I do not much\r\ndislike this answer.\r\n\r\nP. 17. [par. 38.] _Clarendon._ The same rabble entered the house of the\r\nCountess of Rivers near Colchester; for no other ground, than that she\r\nwas a Papist; and in few hours disfurnished it of all the\r\ngoods.--_Swift._ As bad as Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 18. [par. 40.] _Clarendon._ There are monuments enough in the\r\nseditious sermons at that time printed ... of such wresting,\r\nand perverting of Scripture to the odious purposes of the\r\npreacher.--_Swift._ I wish I could find them.\r\n\r\nP. 20. [par. 43.] _Clarendon._ Scottish officers.--_Swift._ Dogs.\r\n\r\nP. 31 [par. 74.] _Clarendon._. A thousand at the most. Most of the\r\npersons of quality, etc. [Swift underscores _most._]\r\n\r\nP. 33. [par. 78.] _Clarendon,_ on the exemption of Prince Rupert from\r\nbeing under the command of the general, Lord Lindsey:--When the King at\r\nmidnight, being in his bed, and receiving intelligence of the enemy's\r\nmotion, commanded the Lord Falkland, his principal secretary of state,\r\nto direct Prince Rupert, what he should do, his Highness took it very\r\nill, and expostulated with the Lord Falkland, for giving him\r\norders.--_Swift._ A great mistake in the King, by too much indulgence to\r\nPrince Rupert.\r\n\r\nP. 40. [par. 90.] _Clarendon._ The King's preferring the Prince's\r\n[Rupert's] opinion in all matters relating to the war before his [Lord\r\nLindsey's].--_Swift._ I blame the King's Partiality.\r\n\r\nP. 48, line 28.--_Swift._ Cursed Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 50. [par. 109.] _Clarendon._ His Majesty had, from time to time,\r\ngiven his council of that kingdom [Scotland] full relations of all his\r\ndifferences with his Parliament.--_Swift._ Cursed Scots for ever.\r\n\r\nP. 51. [par. 112.] _Clarendon._ The chief managers and governors in the\r\nfirst war, by their late intercourse, and communication of guilt, having\r\na firm correspondence with the Marquess of Argyle, the Earl of Lowden,\r\nand that party.--_Swift._ Always a cursed family of Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 59. [par. 142.] _Clarendon._ As the inviting the Scots,\r\netc.--_Swift._ Too long a parenthesis.\r\n\r\nP. 62. [par. 154.] _Clarendon._ For the better recruiting whereof [the\r\nParliament's army], two of their most eminent chaplains, Dr. Downing and\r\nMr. Marshal, publicly avowed, \"that the soldiers lately taken prisoners\r\nat Brentford, and discharged, and released by the King upon their oaths\r\nthat they would never again bear arms against him, were not obliged by\r\nthat oath;\" but, by their power, absolved them thereof.--_Swift._\r\nPerfect Popery.\r\n\r\nP. 65. [par. 161.] _Clarendon,_ the King's message to the privy council\r\nof Scotland:--\"Of all ... the ... indignities, which had been offered to\r\nhim, he doubted not the duty and affection of his Scottish subjects\r\nwould have so just a resentment, that they would express to the world\r\nthe sense they had of his sufferings.\"--_Swift_. Cursed Scots; to trust\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nP. 66. [par. 163.] _Clarendon_, the same;--\"There could not be a clearer\r\nargument to his subjects of Scotland that he had no such thought, [of\r\nbringing in foreign forces,] than that he had hitherto forborne to\r\nrequire the assistance of that his native kingdom; from whose obedience,\r\nduty, and affection, he should confidently expect it, if he thought his\r\nown strength here too weak to preserve him.\"--_Swift_. In vain.\r\n_Clarendon_. \"And of whose courage, and loyalty, he should look to make\r\nuse.\"--_Swift_. And never find.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 164.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"He could not doubt, a\r\ndutiful concurrence in his subjects of Scotland, in the care of his\r\nhonour, and just rights, would draw down a blessing upon that nation\r\ntoo.\"--_Swift_. A Scot's blessing.\r\n\r\nP. 67. [par. 165.] _Clarendon_. Other fruit of their [the Scots']\r\nallegiance he [the King] expected not, than that they should not\r\nrebel.--_Swift_. But they did.\r\n\r\nP. 81. [par. 204,] _Clarendon_, the King's declaration:--\"These are the\r\nmen who ... at this time invite, and solicit our subjects of Scotland,\r\nto enter this land with an army against us.\"--_Swift_. Damnable Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 91. [par. 231, sec. 4.] _Clarendon_, humble desires and propositions\r\nof the Lords and Commons:--\"That your Majesty will be pleased to give\r\nyour royal assent unto the Bill ... for the utter abolishing, and taking\r\naway of all archbishops, bishops, their chancellors, and commissaries,\r\ndeans, sub-deans, deans and chapters, archdeacons, canons, and\r\nprebendaries, and all chanters, chancellors, treasurers, sub-treasurers,\r\nsuccentors, and sacrists, and all vicars choral, choristers, old vicars,\r\nand new vicars of any cathedral, or collegiate church, and all other\r\ntheir under officers, out of the Church of England.\"--_Swift_. A\r\nthorough sweep. _Clarendon_. \"To the Bill against scandalous ministers;\r\nto the Bill against pluralities; and to the Bill for consultation to be\r\nhad with godly, religious, and learned divines.\"--_Swift. i.e._ cursed\r\nfanatics.\r\n\r\nP. 99. [par. 243.] _Clarendon_. Sir Ralph Hopton ... marched to Saltash,\r\na town in Cornwall ... where was a garrison of two hundred Scots; who,\r\n[upon his approach,] as kindly quit Saltash, as the others had\r\nLaunceston before.--_Swift_. Loyal Scots--ever cursed.\r\n\r\nP. 101. [par 247.] _Clarendon_. Ruthen, a Scotchman, the governor of\r\nPlymouth.--_Swift_. A cursed Scottish dog.\r\n\r\nP. 103. [par. 250.] _Clarendon_.

[par. 338.] _Clarendon_, Petition of the Kirk of Scotland:--\"A\r\nchief praise of the Protestant religion (and thereby our not vain, but\r\njust gloriation).\"--_Swift_. Scotch phrase.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Clarendon_, the same:--\"[The Papists] are openly declared to be\r\nnot only good subjects,... but far better subjects than\r\nProtestants.\"--_Swift_. Scotch (Protestants).\r\n\r\nP. 135. [par. 339.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"That your Majesty ... may\r\ntimeously and speedily,\" etc.--_Swift_. Scotch.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 340.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"We are, with greater\r\nearnestness than before, constrained _to fall down again_ before your\r\nMajesty.\"--_Swift_. Rise against.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Clarendon_, the same. They petition:--\"for a meeting of some\r\ndivines to be holden in England, unto which ... some commissioners may\r\nbe sent from this _kirk_.\"--_Swift_. Hell!\r\n\r\nP. 136. [par. 342.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"The strongest let, till it\r\nbe taken out of the way, is the mountain of prelacy.\"--_Swift_. Scottish\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Clarendon_, the same:--\"How many, from the experience of the\r\ntyranny of the prelates, are afraid to discover themselves ... whereas\r\nprelacy being removed, they would openly profess what they are, and join\r\nwith _others_ in the way of reformation.\"--_Swift. i.e._ Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 344.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"The national assembly of\r\nthis kirk, from which we have our commission.\"--_Swift_. From Satan.\r\n\r\nP. 138. [par. 347.] _Clarendon_, the King's answer:--\"Our Church of\r\nScotland.\"--_Swift_. Kirk.\r\n\r\nP. 139. [par. 348.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"We do believe that the\r\npetitioners, when they shall consider how ... unbecoming [it is] in\r\nitself, for them to require, the ancient, happy, and established\r\ngovernment of the Church of England to be altered, and conformed to the\r\nlaws, and constitutions of _another church,_ will find themselves\r\nmisled,\" etc.--_Swift_. A Scotch kirk.\r\n\r\nP. 140. [par. 351.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"To which [synod] we shall\r\nbe willing that some learned divines of our Church of Scotland may be\r\nlikewise sent.\"--_Swift_. To confound all.\r\n\r\nP. 142. [par. 356.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"We conceived, we had not\r\nleft it possible, for any man to ... suspect, that the conversion of\r\n_our dearest consort_ was not so much our desire, that the accession of\r\nas many crowns as God hath already bestowed on us, would not be more\r\nwelcome to us than that day.\"--_Swift_. A thorough Papist.\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nP. 199. [par. 71.] _Clarendon_. Being this way secure from any future\r\nclamours for peace, they proceeded to try Mr. Tomkins, Mr. Chaloner, ...\r\nMr. Hambden, who brought the last message from the King, etc.--_Swift._\r\nWhich Hambden? Not the rebel Hambden? No, it was one Alexander Hambden.\r\n\r\nP. 201. [par. 75.] _Clarendon_. In the beginning of the war, the army in\r\nScotland having been lately disbanded, many officers of that nation, who\r\nhad served in Germany and in France, betook themselves to the service of\r\nthe Parliament.--_Swift_ Cursed Scots for ever. _Clarendon_. Whereof\r\ndivers were men of good conduct, and courage; though there were more as\r\nbad as the cause, in which they engaged. Of the former sort Colonel\r\nHurry was a man of name, and reputation.--_Swift._ A miracle! Colonel\r\nUrrie was an honest, valiant, loyal Scot, repenting his mistakes.\r\n\r\nP. 203. [par. 78.] _Clarendon_. The man [Hurry] was in his nature proud,\r\nand imperious.--_Swift_. A mixture of the Scot.\r\n\r\nP. 219. [par. 106.] _Clarendon_. On the brow of the hill there were\r\nbreast-works, on which were pretty bodies of small shot, and some\r\ncannon; on either flank grew a pretty thick wood.--_Swift_. Silly style.\r\n\r\nP. 244. [par. 162.] _Clarendon_. \"We, the Inhabitants, Magistrates,\"\r\netc.--_Swift_. Cursed rogues.\r\n\r\nP. 261. [par. 199.] _Clarendon_. Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, a young\r\ngentleman ... of a fair and plentiful fortune.--_Swift._ Earl of\r\nShaftesbury by Charles II. A great villain.\r\n\r\nP. 262. [par. 199.] _Clarendon_. The flexibility and instability of that\r\ngentleman's nature, not being then understood, or suspected.--_Swift_.\r\nShaftesbury, an early rogue.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 200.] _Clarendon_. The express returned without effect\r\n[from the King], and the Marquess [of Hertford] was as sensibly touched\r\nas could be imagined; and said, \"that he was fallen from all credit with\r\nthe King,\" etc.--_Swift_. Too fond of those nephews.\r\n\r\nP. 271. [par. 221.] _Clarendon_. [Lord Falkland] writ two large\r\ndiscourses against the principal positions of that [the Roman Catholic]\r\nreligion, with that sharpness of style, and full weight of reason, that\r\nthe Church is deprived of great jewels in the concealment of them, and\r\nthat they are not published to the world.--_Swift_. Ten thousand pities\r\nthat they are not to be recovered!\r\n\r\nP. 277. [par. 234.] _Clarendon_. Thus fell that incomparable young man,\r\n[Lord Falkland,] in the four-and-thirtieth year of his age, having so\r\nmuch dispatched the true business of life, that the eldest rarely attain\r\nto that immense knowledge, and the youngest enter not into the world\r\nwith more innocency: Whosoever leads such a life needs be the less\r\nanxious upon how short warning it is taken from him.--_Swift_. It moves\r\ngrief to the highest excess.\r\n\r\nP. 277. [par. 236.] _Clarendon_, on the jealousy between Essex and\r\nWaller:--The passion and animosity which difference of opinion had\r\nproduced between any members, was totally laid aside and forgotten, and\r\nno artifice omitted to make the world believe, that they were a people\r\nnewly incorporated, and as firmly united to one and the same end, as\r\ntheir brethren the Scots.--_Swift_. Deceitful Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 282. [par. 246.] _Clarendon_. Earl of Holland.--_Swift._ Treacherous.\r\n\r\nP. 283 [par. 247.] _Clarendon_, the Earl of Holland, on his return from\r\nOxford, published a Declaration, in which he announced:--that he found\r\nthe court so indisposed to peace ... that he resolved to make what haste\r\nhe could back to the Parliament, and to spend the remainder of his life\r\nin their service: which action, so contrary to his own natural\r\ndiscretion and generosity, etc.--_Swift_. Treachery.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 249.] _Clarendon_. The committee from the two Houses of\r\nParliament, which was sent into Scotland in July before ... found that\r\nkingdom in so good and ready a posture for their reception, that they\r\nhad called an assembly of their kirk; and a convention of their estates,\r\nwithout, and expressly against, the King's consent.--_Swift_. Diabolical\r\nScots for ever.\r\n\r\nP. 284. [par. 250.] _Clarendon_, the Scotch said to the English\r\ncommissioners.--that there were many well-wishers to him [the King], and\r\nmaligners, in their hearts, of the present reformation.--_Swift_. Cursed\r\nScots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 252.] _Clarendon_. A form of words was quickly agreed on\r\nbetween them, for a perfect combination and _marriage_ between the\r\nParliament and the Scots.--_Swift_. Satan was parson.\r\n\r\nP. 285. [par. 254.] _Clarendon_. The Assembly, besides ... execute\r\nexecute his commands. [19 lines in one sentence.]--_Swift_. A long\r\nconfounding period.\r\n\r\nP. 288. [par. 259, sec. 3.] _Clarendon_. A Solemn League and Covenant.\r\n\"To preserve ... liberties of the Kingdoms.\"--_Swift_. Damnable rebel\r\nScots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [sec. 6.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"And the honour of the\r\nKing.\"--_Swift_. By martyrdom.\r\n\r\nP. 289. [par. 259, conclusion.] _Clarendon_, the same:--\"We have not as\r\nwe ought valued the inestimable benefit of the Gospel.\"--_Swift_. All\r\nvery true.\r\n\r\nP. 291. [par. 264.] _Clarendon_. They very devoutly extolled the\r\nCovenant, magnified the Scottish nation, with all imaginable attributes\r\nof esteem and reverence,... a nation that had reformed their lives for\r\nso small a time, more than ever any people, that they knew of, in the\r\nworld had done.--_Swift._ Most diabolical Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 292. [par. 267.] _Clarendon_. [Sir Harry Vane the younger.] There\r\nneed no more be said of his ability, than that he was chosen to cozen,\r\nand deceive a whole nation which was thought to excel in craft and\r\ncunning.--_Swift_. Could out-cheat a Scot.\r\n\r\nP. 293. [par. 269.] _Clarendon_. Those of the nobility and gentry, who\r\ndid really desire to serve the King, applied themselves to Duke\r\nHamilton.--_Swift_. That duke was a hellish, treacherous villain of a\r\nScot.\r\n\r\nP. 316. [par. 322.] _Clarendon_. At this time, nothing troubled the King\r\nso much, as the intelligence he received from Scotland, that they had\r\nalready formed their army, and resolved to enter England in the winter\r\nseason.--_Swift_. Cursed Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_., line 37.--_Swift_. Scottish Dogs.\r\n\r\nP. 318. [par. 328.] _Clarendon_, on the proclamation for a Parliament at\r\nOxford.--A proclamation was issued out, containing the true grounds and\r\nmotives, and mentioning the league of Scotland to invade the kingdom;\r\nwhich was the most universally odious, and detestable.--_Swift_. Hellish\r\nScots.\r\n\r\nP. 339 [Par. 373.] _Clarendon_, Letter from the Parliament of Oxford to\r\nthe Earl of Essex. They conjure him to lay to heart:--\"the inward\r\nbleeding condition of your country, and the outward more menacing\r\ndestruction by a foreign nation.\"--_Swift_. Cursed Scotland.\r\n\r\nP. 340. [par. 377.] _Clarendon_, Essex's answer to the Earl of\r\nForth.--_Swift_. Essex was a cursed rebel.\r\n\r\nP. 341. [par. 379.] _Clarendon_, on the Declaration of the Scots on\r\nentering England.--_Swift_. Abominable, damnable, Scotch hellish dogs\r\nfor ever. Let them wait for Cromwell to plague them, and enslave their\r\nscabby nation.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 380.] _Clarendon_, the same.--They said, \"the question was\r\nnot,... whether they might propagate their religion by arms?\"\r\netc.--_Swift_. Diabolical Scots for ever.\r\n\r\nP. 342. [par. 383.] _Clarendon_. This war was of God.--_Swift_. An error\r\nmistaking the Devil for God.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 384.] _Clarendon_, Declaration of England and\r\nScotland:--They gave now \"public warning to all men to rest no longer\r\nupon their neutrality,... but that they address themselves speedily to\r\ntake the Covenant.\"--_Swift_. The Devil made that damnable Scots\r\nCovenant.\r\n\r\nP. 343. [par. 385] _Clarendon_. Then they proclaimed a pardon to all\r\nthose who would before such a day desert the King, and adhere to them,\r\nand take the Covenant.--_Swift_. The Devil to take the Covenant.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 386.] _Clarendon_. I cannot but observe, that after this\r\ntime that the Earl [of Essex] declined this opportunity of declaring\r\nhimself, he never did prosperous act in the remainder of his\r\nlife.--_Swift_. I am heartily glad of that.\r\n\r\nP. 343. [par. 388.] _Clarendon_. There wanted not a just indignation at\r\nthe return of this trumpet; and yet the answer being so much in that\r\npopular road, of saying something plausibly to the people, it was\r\nthought fit again to make an attempt, that at least the world might see,\r\nthat they did, in plain _English_ refuse to admit of any\r\npeace.--_Swift_. Scotch.\r\n\r\nP. 347. [par. 398, sec. 2.] _Clarendon_, Declaration of the Parliament\r\nat Oxford:--\"All his Majesty's subjects of the kingdom of England and\r\ndominion of Wales, are both by their allegiance, and the Act of\r\nPacification, bound to resist and repress all those of Scotland as had,\r\nor should enter upon any part of his Majesty's realm.\"--_Swift_.\r\nExecrable Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 348. [_ibid,_ sec. 5.] _Clarendon_ the same:--\"That the Lords and\r\nCommons remaining at Westminster, who had given their consents to the\r\npresent coming in of the Scots in a warlike manner, had therein\r\ncommitted high treason.\"--_Swift_. Rebel Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 400.] _Clarendon_. The invasion, which the Scots made in\r\nthe depth of winter, and the courage the enemy took from thence,\r\ndeprived his Majesty even of any rest in that season.--_Swift_. Cursed\r\nScots, ever inflaming.\r\n\r\nP. 351. [par. 404.] _Clarendon_. The Earl of Montrose ... was so much in\r\nthe jealousy, and detestation of the violent party, whereof the _Earl of\r\nArgyle_ was the head, that there was no cause or room left to doubt his\r\nsincerity to the King.--_Swift_. Odious dog; and so are all his\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 405.] _Clarendon_. Duke Hamilton.--_Swift_. An arrant\r\nScot.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Clarendon_. As soon as the King had had fuller intelligence.\r\n[Swift alters the second _had to received_.]\r\n\r\nP. 352. [par. 407.] _Clarendon_. The Duke [Hamilton] had given the King\r\nan account,... that though some few hot, and passionate men, desired to\r\nput themselves in arms, to stop both elections of the Members, and any\r\nmeeting together in Parliament; yet, that all sober men ... were clearly\r\nof the opinion, to take as much pains as they could to cause good\r\nelections to be made.--_Swift._ What! in Scotland?\r\n\r\nP. 353. [par. 409.] _Clarendon_. About this time the councils at\r\nWestminster lost a principal supporter, by the death of John Pym; who\r\ndied with great torment and agony of a disease unusual, and therefore\r\nthe more spoken of, _morbus pediculosus,_ as was reported.--_Swift_. I\r\nwish all his clan had died of the same disease.\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nP. 382. [par. 60.] _Clarendon_. Colonel Ashburnham, then governor of\r\nWeymouth, was made choice of for that command; ...and, to make way for\r\nhim, Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper had been, the year before, removed from\r\nthat charge; and was thereby so much disobliged, that he quitted the\r\nKing's party, and gave himself up, body and soul, to the service of the\r\nParliament, with an implacable animosity against the royal\r\ninterest.--_Swift_. A rogue all his life.\r\n\r\nP. 385. [par. 66.] _Clarendon_, at Cropredy-bridge:--the [parliamentary]\r\ngeneral of their ordnance [was] taken prisoner. This man, one Weemes, a\r\nScotchman, had been as much obliged by the King, as a man of his\r\ncondition could be, and in a manner very unpopular: for he was made\r\nmaster-gunner of England,... and having never done the King the least\r\nservice, he took the first opportunity to disserve him.--_Swift_. A\r\ncursed, hellish Scot! Why was not the rogue hanged?\r\n\r\nP-387. [par. 69.] _Clarendon_, Message from the King to the\r\nparliamentary army:--It was agreed, that Sir Edward Walker (who was both\r\nGarter king at arms, and secretary to the council of war) should be sent\r\nto publish that, his Majesty's grace.--_Swift_. A very mean author.\r\n\r\nP. 388. [par. 74.] _Clarendon_, Battle of Marston-moor:--That party of\r\nthe King's horse which charged the Scots, so totally routed and defeated\r\ntheir whole army, that they fled all ways for many miles\r\ntogether.--_Swift_. I am glad of that.\r\n\r\nP. 420. [par. 153.] _Clarendon_. Colonel Hurry, a Scotchman, who had\r\nformerly served the Parliament, and is well mentioned, in the\r\ntransactions of the last year, for having quitted them, and performed\r\nsome signal service to the King,... desired a pass to go beyond the\r\nseas, and so quitted the service: but instead of embarking himself, made\r\nhaste to London; and put himself now into the Earl of Manchester's army,\r\nand made a discovery of all he knew of the King's army.--_Swift_.\r\nMentioned before, and then I was deceived by him; but now I find him a\r\ncursed true Scot.\r\n\r\nP. 427. [par. 167.] _Clarendon_. After the battle of York, the Scots\r\nreturned to reduce Newcastle; which they had already done; and all other\r\ngarrisons which had held out for the King.--_Swift_. Most damnable\r\nScots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 168.] _Clarendon_. The King's army was less united than\r\never; the old general was set aside, and Prince Rupert put into the\r\ncommand, which was no popular change.--_Swift_. Too fond of his nephews.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 169.] _Clarendon_. Wilmot loved debauchery.--_Swift_.\r\nCharacter of Wilmot and Goring.\r\n\r\nP. 453. [par. 233.] _Clarendon_, Treaty at Uxbridge: Debates about the\r\nmilitia. They insisted:--upon having the whole command of the militia by\r\nsea, and land, and all the forts, and ships of the kingdom at their\r\ndisposal; without which they looked upon themselves as lost, and at the\r\nKing's mercy; not considering that he must be at theirs, if such a power\r\nwas committed to them.--_Swift_. The case seems doubtful. The point\r\nshould be undecided.\r\n\r\nP. 454. [par. 235.] _Clarendon_, the same: Ireland. The Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer:--put them in mind, ... [that] one hundred thousand\r\npounds, brought in by the adventurers for Ireland, had been sent in one\r\nentire sum into _Scotland_, to prepare and dispose that kingdom to send\r\nan army to invade this.--_Swift_ Cursed.\r\n\r\nP. 456. [On this page two _ands_ are erased.]\r\n\r\nP. 457. [par. 241.] _Clarendon_. The conversation ... made a great\r\ndiscovery of the faction that was in the Parliament ... that the Scots\r\nwould insist _upon_ the whole government of the Church, and in all other\r\nmatters would _defer_ to the King.--_Swift_. [Instead of _upon,_] to\r\ndestroy; [and instead of _defer,_] to betray.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 242.] _Clarendon_. Satisfied, that in the particular which\r\nconcerned the Church, the Scots would never depart from a\r\ntittle.--_Swift_. Scots hell-hounds.\r\n\r\nP. 466. [par. 262.] _Clarendon_. After the battle at York, ... the\r\nScotch army marched northwards, to reduce the little garrisons remaining\r\nin those parts; which was easily done.--_Swift_. Scottish dogs.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 263.] _Clarendon_. The person whom that earl [of Montrose]\r\nmost hated, and contemned, was the Marquess of Argyle.--_Swift_. A most\r\ndamnable false dog, and so are still their family.\r\n\r\nP. 478. [par. 284.] _Clarendon_. The Parliament had, some months before,\r\nmade an ordinance against giving quarter to any of the Irish nation\r\nwhich should be taken prisoners. ... The Earl of Warwick, and the\r\nofficers under him at sea, had as often as he met with any Irish\r\nfrigates, ... taken all the seamen who became prisoners to them of that\r\nnation, and bound them back to back, and thrown them overboard into the\r\nsea.--_Swift_. Barbarous villains, and rebels.\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nP. 484. [par. 2.] _Clarendon_. Persons, whose memories ought to be\r\ncharged with their own evil actions, rather than that the infamy of them\r\nshould be laid on the age wherein they lived; which did produce as many\r\nmen, eminent for their loyalty and incorrupted fidelity to the crown, as\r\nany that had preceded it.--_Swift_. Not quite.\r\n\r\nP. 485. [par. 4.] _Clarendon_. The Marquess of Argyle was now come from\r\nScotland.--_Swift_. A cursed Scotch hell-hound.\r\n\r\nP. 501. [par. 29.] _Clarendon_. Prince Rupert ... disposed the King to\r\nresolve to march northwards, and to fall upon the Scotch army in\r\nYorkshire, before Fairfax should be able to perfect his new model to\r\nthat degree, as to take the field.--_Swift._ Cursed Scots still.\r\n\r\nP. 516. [par. 55.] _Clarendon,_ on Sir Richard Greenvil hanging an\r\nattorney named Brabant, as a spy, out of private revenge.--_Swift._\r\nThis rogue would almost be a perfect Scot.\r\n\r\nP. 521. [par. 63.] _Clarendon_. (The which had been already so\r\nscandalous, ... contribution.) [61/2 lines between parentheses.]\r\n--_Swift._ Long parenthesis.\r\n\r\nP. 574. [par. 164] _Clarendon_. The King ... resolved once more to try\r\nanother way, ... [whereby] he should discover, whether he had so many\r\nfriends in the Parliament, and the city, as many men would persuade him\r\nto conclude; and whether the Scots had ever a thought of doing him\r\nservice.--_Swift._ No more than Beelzebub.\r\n\r\nP. 579. [par. 175.] _Clarendon_. Monsieur Montrevil [was sent] into\r\nEngland: ... who likewise persuaded his Majesty, to believe  ... that\r\nthe cardinal was well assured, that the Scots would behave themselves\r\nhenceforwards very honestly.--_Swift._ Damnable Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 580. [par. 176.] _Clarendon_. The Scots were resolved to have _no\r\nmore_ to do with his Majesty.--_Swift_. Gave up the King.\r\n\r\nVOLUME III.\r\n\r\nOn the bastard title: That frequent expression,--_upon the word of a\r\nking_, I have always despised and detested, for a thousand reasons.\r\n\r\nDedication, 21st par. [vol. I., p. li., edit of 1888.] _Clarendon._ Some\r\nvery near that King ... putting him on the thoughts of marrying some\r\nRoman Catholic lady.--_Swift_. As he did.\r\n\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nP. 2. [par. 2.] _Clarendon_. Sir Dudley Wyat had been sent expressly from\r\nthe Lord Jermin, to assure the prince, that such a body of five thousand\r\nfoot were actually raised under the command of _Ruvignie_, and should be\r\nembarked for Pendennis within less than a month.--_Swift_. Father to\r\nLord Galloway; a Huguenot.\r\n\r\nP. 6. [par. 11.] _Clarendon_, Upon the Queen's hearing that the King had\r\ngone to the Scots army, she:--renewed her command for the prince's\r\nimmediate repair into France; whereas the chief reason before was, that\r\nhe would put himself into the Scots' hands.--_ Swift_. He could not do\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nP. 7 [par. 12] _Clarendon_ The King ... was by this time known to be in\r\nthe Scots army--_Swift_. And these hell hounds sold him to the rebels.\r\n\r\nP. 11 [par. 21] _Clarendon_ [The Scots] had pressed the King to do many\r\nthings, which he had absolutely refused to do, and that thereupon they\r\nhad put very strict guards upon his Majesty, ... so that his Majesty\r\nlooked upon himself as a prisoner--_Swift_. The cursed Scots begin their\r\nnew treachery.\r\n\r\nP. 14 [par. 27] _Clarendon_, on \"the paper Montrevil sent to the King,\r\nbeing a promise for the Scots receiving the King, Apr 1\"--_Swift_.\r\nMontrevil might as safely promise for Satan as for the Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 28] _Clarendon_ on Montrevil's advertising the King of the\r\nchange in the Scotch--_Swift_. Will Montrevil trust them again?\r\n\r\nP. 15 [ditto] _Clarendon_ [The Sots] with much ado agreed, that the two\r\nprinces [Rupert and Maurice] ... might follow the King, with such other\r\nof his servants as were not excepted from pardon--_Swift_. And why\r\nthose? Because the Scots were part of the rebels.\r\n\r\nP. 16 [par. 30] _Clarendon_, in a letter from Montrevil--\"They tell me\r\nthat they will do more than can be expressed\"--_Swift_. So the Scots\r\ndid, and with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [ditto] _Clarendon_, in the same--\"The hindering his Majesty\r\nfrom falling into the hands of the English is of so great importance to\r\nthem, that it cannot be believed but that they will do all that lies in\r\ntheir power to hinder it\"--_Swift_. By delivering him up for money.\r\nHellish Scottish dogs!\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 31] _Clarendon_. If he [Montrevil] were too sanguine ...\r\nwhen he signed that engagement upon the first of April, etc.--_Swift_.\r\nApril fool.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The words quoted are the side note, which is not printed in\r\nthe edition of 1888 [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nP. 17 [par. 33] _Clarendon_. In this perplexity, he [the King] chose\r\nrather to commit himself to the Scots army--_Swift_. To be delivered up\r\nfor money.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [ditto] _Clarendon_. He left Oxford, ... leaving those of his\r\ncouncil in Oxford who were privy to his going out, not informed whether\r\nhe would go to the Scots army, etc.--_Swift_. Which would betray him,\r\nthough his countrymen.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [ditto] _Clarendon_ [The King,] in the end, went into the Scots\r\narmy before Newark--_Swift_. Prodigious weakness, to trust the\r\nmalicious Scotch hell-hounds.\r\n\r\nP. 17. [par. 34.] _Clarendon_. The Scottish commissioners at London\r\n[assured the Parliament] ... that all their orders would meet with an\r\nabsolute obedience in their army.--_Swift_. No doubt of it.\r\n\r\nP. 18. [par. 35.] _Clarendon_, in the text of the sermon preached at\r\nNewark before the King:--\"And all _the men of Judah_ answered the men of\r\nIsrael, Because the King is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye\r\nangry for this matter?\"--_Swift._ Scotch, (opposite to Judah).\r\n\r\nP. 21. [par. 41.] _Clarendon_, Lord Digby and Lord Jermin said:--that\r\nthere should be an army of thirty thousand men immediately transported\r\ninto England, with the Prince of Wales in the head of them.--_Swift_.\r\nGasconade.\r\n\r\nP. 23. [par. 50.] _Clarendon_. The Parliament made many sharp instances\r\nthat the King might be delivered into their hands; and that the Scots\r\narmy would return into their own country, having done what they were\r\nsent for, and the war being at an end.--_Swift_. By the event they\r\nproved true Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 51.] _Clarendon_. [The Scots] made as great profession to\r\nhim [the King,] of their duty and good purposes, which they said they\r\nwould manifest as soon as it should be _seasonable_.--_Swift_. See the\r\nevent;--still Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 52.] _Clarendon_, the Marquess of Montrose.--_Swift_ The\r\nonly honest Scot.\r\n\r\nP. 24. [par. 53.] _Clarendon_. [It] is still believed, that if his\r\nMajesty would have been induced to have satisfied them in that\r\nparticular [the extirpation of Episcopacy in England,] they would ...\r\nthereupon have declared for the King.--_Swift_. Rather declare for the\r\nDevil.\r\n\r\nP. 26. [par. 60.] _Clarendon_. When the Scots, etc.--_Swift_. Cursed\r\nScots.\r\n\r\nP. 27. [par. 62.] _Clarendon_. That all Governors of any Garrisons, etc.\r\n--_Swift_. Cursed, abominable, hellish, Scottish villains, everlasting\r\ntraitors, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nP. 28. [par. 64.] _Clarendon_. The Scots, who were enough convinced that\r\nhis Majesty could never be wrought upon to sacrifice the Church ... used\r\nall the rude importunity and threats to his Majesty, to persuade him\r\nfreely to consent to all.--__Swift _. Most damnable Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 65.] _Clarendon_. The Chancellor of Scotland told him,\r\netc.--_Swift_. Cursed Scots Chancellor [this remark obliterated].\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 66.] _Clarendon_. The General Assembly ... had petitioned\r\nthe conservators of the peace of the kingdom, that if the King should\r\nrefuse to give satisfaction to his Parliament, he might not be permitted\r\nto come into Scotland.--_Swift_. Scots inspired by Beelzebub.\r\n\r\nP. 29. [par. 68.] _Clarendon_. They agreed; and, upon the payment of two\r\nhundred thousand pounds in hand, and security for as much more upon days\r\nagreed upon, the Scots delivered the King up.--_Swift_. Cursed Scot!\r\nsold his King for a groat. Hellish Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 69.] _Clarendon_. In this infamous manner that excellent\r\nprince was ... given up, by his Scots subjects, to those of his English\r\nwho were intrusted by the Parliament to receive him.--_Swift_. From this\r\nperiod the English Parliament were turned into Scotch devils.\r\n\r\nP. 31. [par. 76.] _Clarendon_, Sir Harry Killigrew:--When the Earl of\r\nEssex was chosen general, and the several members of the House stood up,\r\nand declared, what horse they would raise,  ... one saying he would\r\nraise ten horses, and another twenty, he stood up and said, \"he would\r\nprovide a good horse, and a good buff coat, and a good pair of pistols,\r\nand then he doubted not but he should find a good cause;\" and so went\r\nout of the House, and rode post into Cornwall.--_Swift_. Another loyall\r\nman used the like saying.\r\n\r\nP. 53. [par. 118.] _Clarendon_. Many years after, when he [the Duke of\r\nYork] ... made the full relation of all the particulars to me, with that\r\ncommotion of spirit, that it appeared to be deeply rooted in him;\r\n[speaking of the King's injunctions to the duke].--_Swift_. Yet he lived\r\nand died a rank Papist, and lost his kingdom.\r\n\r\nP. 55. [par. 121.] _Clarendon_. No men were fuller of professions of\r\nduty [to the King], ... than the Scottish commissioners.--_Swift_ The\r\nScots dogs delivered up their King. False-hearted Scots. [This addition\r\nobliterated.]\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 122.] _Clarendon_. The agitators, and council of officers,\r\nsent some propositions to the King.--_Swift_. Detestable villains,\r\nalmost as bad as Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 64 [par. 136] _Clarendon_. Mr. Ashburnham had so great a detestation\r\nof the Scots.--_Swift_. So have I.\r\n\r\nP. 68. [par. 144.] _Clarendon_. Hammond,--_Swift_. A detes Villain,\r\nalmost as wicked as a Scot.\r\n\r\nP. 76. [par. 159.] _Clarendon_, Marquess of Argyle.--_Swift_. Always a\r\ncursed family.\r\n\r\nP. 77 [par. 159.] _Clarendon_. The commissioners ... were confident that\r\nall Scotland would rise as one man for his Majesty's defence and\r\nvindication.--_Swift_. A strange stupidity, to trust Scots at any time.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 160.] _Clarendon_. They required ... \"that the Prince of\r\nWales should be present with them, and march in the head of their army.\"\r\n... The King would by no means consent that the prince should go into\r\nScotland.--_Swift_. The King acted wisely not to trust the Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 79. [par. 162.] _Clarendon_, Treaty signed, Dec. 26, 1647. They (the\r\nScotch) required:--that an effectual course should be taken ... for the\r\nsuppressing the opinions and practices of anti-trinitarians, arians,\r\nsocinians, anti-scripturists, anabaptists, antinomians, arminians,\r\nfamilists, brownists, separatists, independents, libertines, and\r\nseekers.--_Swift_. What a medley of religions! in all thirteen.\r\n\r\nP. 80. [par. 163.] _Clarendon_, the same:--They would assert the right\r\nthat belonged to the crown, in the power of the militia, the great seal,\r\nbestowing of honours and offices of trust, choice of the\r\nprivy-councillors, and the right of the King's negative voice in\r\nParliament.--_Swift_. They would rather be hanged than agree.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [ditto.] _Clarendon_, the same:--An army should be sent out of\r\nScotland ... for making a firm union between the kingdoms under his\r\nMajesty, and his posterity.--_Swift_. Scotch impudence.\r\n\r\nP. 81. [par. 165.] _Clarendon_, the same:--The King engaged himself to\r\nemploy those of the Scots nation equally with the English in all foreign\r\nemployments, and negotiations; and that a third part of all the offices\r\nand places about the King, Queen, and Prince, should be conferred upon\r\nsome persons of that nation.--_Swift_. Impudent Scottish scoundrels.\r\n\r\nP. 83. [par. 169.] _Clarendon_. The Presbyterians, by whom I mean the\r\nScots, formed all their counsels by the inclinations, and affections of\r\nthe people.--_Swift_. Hellish Scotch dogs.\r\n\r\nP. 85. [par. 171.] _Clarendon_. With this universal applause, he\r\n[Fairfax] compelled the Scots army to depart the kingdom, with\r\nthat circumstance as must ever after render them odious and\r\ninfamous.--_Swift_. He out-cunninged the Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 86. [par. 172.] _Clarendon_. But the delivery of the King up, besides\r\nthe infamy of it, etc.--_Swift_. That infamy is in the scurvy nature of\r\na _Scot_, and the best ... of their false hearts. [Written in pencil and\r\nrubbed out--one word is illegible.]\r\n\r\nP. 89. [par. 179.] _Clarendon_. The vile artifices of the Scottish\r\ncommissioners to draw the King into their hands.--_Swift_. Vile,\r\ntreacherous Scots for ever.\r\n\r\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\nP. 97. [par. 13.] _Clarendon_, on the discourses against the English in\r\nthe Scottish Parliament:--This discourse ... was entertained by the rest\r\nwith so general a reception, that Argyle found it would be to no purpose\r\ndirectly to contradict or oppose it.--_Swift_. An infamous dog, like all\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nP. 108. [par. 35.] _Clarendon_. The Prince [Charles II.] set sail first\r\nfor Yarmouth road, then for the Downs, having sent his brother, the Duke\r\nof York, with all his family, to The Hague.--_Swift_. A sorry admiral.\r\n\r\nP. 109 [ditto] _Clarendon_. The Prince determining to engage his own\r\nperson, he [the Duke] submitted to the determination--_Swift_. Popery\r\nand cowardice stuck with him all his life.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 36] _Clarendon_. The Prince came prepared to depend wholly\r\nupon the Presbyterian party, which, besides the power of the _Scots\r\narmy,_ which was every day expected to invade England, was thought to be\r\npossessed of all the strength of the City of London.--_Swift_. Curse on\r\nthe rogues!\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [same par.] _Clarendon_. Sent from the Scots[7]--_Swift_. So\r\nmuch the worse to rely on the cursed Scots.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The words are \"sent from thence\" in edition of 1888. [T.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\nP. 112 [par. 43] _Clarendon_. Argyle took notice of Sir Marmaduke\r\nLangdale's, and Sir Philip Musgrave's being in the town.--_Swift_. That\r\nScotch dog.\r\n\r\nP. 113 [par. 45] _Clarendon_. They entreated them with all imaginable\r\nimportunity, that they would take the Covenant.--_Swift_. Their damned\r\nCovenant.\r\n\r\nP. 117 [par. 53] _Clarendon_. Sir Philip Musgrave, that it might appear\r\nthat they did not exclude any who had taken the Covenant, etc.--_Swift_.\r\nConfound their damnable Covenant!\r\n\r\nP. 129 [par. 85] _Clarendon_. Defeat of the Scots army--_Swift_. I\r\ncannot be sorry.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [pars. 86, 87] _Clarendon_, after the defeat of the Scottish\r\narmy, the Earl of Lauderdale had been sent to The Hague The Prince of\r\nWales--thought fit, that the earl should give an account of his\r\ncommission at the board, ... and, that all respect might be shewed to\r\nthe Parliament of Scotland, he had a chair allowed him to sit\r\nupon--_Swift_. Respect to a Scotch Parliament, with a pox.\r\n\r\nP. 130 [par. 87] _Clarendon_. Redeem His Majesty's person from that\r\ncaptivity, which they held themselves obliged ... to endeavour to\r\ndo--_Swift_. Not to do.\r\n\r\nP. 133 [par. 96] _Clarendon_. Within a short time after, orders were\r\nsent out of Scotland for the delivery of Berwick and Carlisle to the\r\nParliament--_Swift_. Cursed Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 98] _Clarendon_. It was generally believed, that the\r\nMarquess of Argyle earnestly invited him [Cromwell] to this progress\r\n[into Scotland]--_Swift_. That eternal dog, Argyle.\r\n\r\nP. 141 [par. 114] _Clarendon_. By the time that the commissioners\r\nreturned from the Isle of Wight, and delivered this answer to the\r\nParliament, news was brought of the defeat of the Scots army, and\r\nCromwell had written to his friends, etc.--_Swift_. A cursed hell\r\nhound.\r\n\r\nP. 142. [par. 116.] _Clarendon_. When there appeared some hopes that the\r\nScots would raise an army for the relief and release of the\r\nKing.--_Swift_. Trust them not, for they are Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 145. [par. 120.] _Clarendon_. And himself a prisoner.--_Swift._ Base.\r\n\r\nP. 155. [par. 141.] _Clarendon_. The Duke [of York], who was not yet\r\nabove fifteen years of age, was so far from desiring to be with the\r\nfleet, that, when there was once a proposition, upon occasion of a\r\nsudden mutiny amongst the seamen, that he should go ... amongst them,\r\nwho professed great duty to his Highness, he was so offended at it that\r\nhe would not hear of it.--_Swift_. The Duke's courage was always\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nP. 157. [par. 146.] _Clarendon_. (Many persons of honour ... the rest\r\nhad done.)--_Swift_. Parenthesis eleven lines.\r\n\r\nP. 167. [par. 169.] _Clarendon_. Two of them [the ministers] very\r\nplainly and fiercely told the King, \"that if he did not consent to the\r\nutter abolishing of the Episcopacy, he would be damned.\"--_Swift_. Very\r\ncivil.\r\n\r\nP. 168. [par. 172.] _Clarendon_. [The King] did, with much reluctancy,\r\noffer ... \"to suspend Episcopacy for three years,\" etc.--_Swift_.\r\nPrudent concessions.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [ditto.] _Clarendon_, he consented:--likewise, \"that money\r\nshould be raised upon the sale of the Church lands, and only\r\nthe old rent should be reserved to the just owners and their\r\nsuccessors.\"--_Swift_. Scotch principles.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 173.] _Clarendon_. They required farther, \"that in all\r\ncases, when the Lords and Commons shall declare the safety of the\r\nkingdom to be concerned, unless the King give his royal assent to such a\r\nBill as shall be tendered to him for raising money, the Bill shall have\r\nthe force of an Act of Parliament, as if he had given his royal\r\nassent.\"--_Swift_. English dogs, as bad as Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 170. [par. 176.] _Clarendon_, on the King's concessions.--_Swift_.\r\nAfter so many concessions, the commissioners shewed themselves most\r\ndamnable villains.\r\n\r\nP. 172. [par. 181.] _Clarendon_. [The King] confessed, \"If they would\r\npreserve the Scripture Bishop he would take away the Bishop by\r\nLaw.\"--_Swift_. Indeed! a great concession.\r\n\r\nP. 174. [par. 187.] _Clarendon_. For Scotland, they demanded \"the King's\r\nconsent, to confirm by Act of Parliament such agreements as should be\r\nmade by both Houses with that kingdom  ... for the settling and\r\npreserving a happy and durable peace between the two nations, and for\r\nthe mutual defence of each other.\"--_Swift_. A most diabolical alliance.\r\n\r\nP. 175. [par. 189.] _Clarendon_, on the letter from the King to his son,\r\nconcerning the treaty.--_Swift_. The whole letter is a most excellent\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nP. 176. [par. 189.] _Clarendon_. The major part of both Houses of\r\nParliament was, at that time, so far from desiring the execution of all\r\nthose concessions, that, if they had been able to have resisted the wild\r\nfury of _the army_, they would have been themselves suitors to have\r\ndeclined the greatest part of them.--_Swift_. Diabolical villains.\r\n\r\nP. 177. [par. 193.] _Clarendon_. It cannot be imagined how wonderfully\r\nfearful some persons in France were that he [the King] should have made\r\nhis escape, and the dread they had of his coming thither.--_Swift_.\r\nFrench villains.\r\n\r\nP. 180. [par. 198.] _Clarendon_, the Commons sent to Winchester:--their\r\nwell tried Serjeant Wild, to be the sole judge of that circuit.--_Swift_.\r\nAn infernal dog.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 200.] _Clarendon_. Young Sir Harry Vane had begun the\r\ndebate [upon the treaty] with the highest insolence, and\r\nprovocation.--_Swift_. A cursed insolent villain, worse than even a\r\nScot, or his own father.\r\n\r\nP. 183. [par. 206.] _Clarendon_, on the seizure of many Members entering\r\ninto the House, by the soldiers.--_Swift_. Damnable proceeding.\r\n\r\nP. 184. [ditto.] _Clarendon_, the remaining Members vote the contrary to\r\ntheir former votes:--that the answer the King had given to their\r\npropositions was not satisfactory.--_Swift_. Cursed rogues.\r\n\r\nP. 189. [par. 221.] _Clarendon_. Harrison was the son of a\r\nbutcher.--_Swift_. The fitter for that office.\r\n\r\nP. 195. [par. 233.] _Clarendon_, Trial of the King:--The King ... told\r\nthem, \"he would first know of them, by what authority they presumed by\r\nforce to bring him before them, and who gave them power to judge of his\r\nactions, for which he was accountable to none but God.\"--_Swift_. Very\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nP. 198. [par. 241] _Clarendon_. [The King] was always a great lover of\r\nthe Scottish nation.--_Swift_. There I differ from him.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [ditto.] _Clarendon_. Having not only been born there, but\r\neducated by that people, and besieged by them always.--_Swift_. Who\r\nwere the cause of his destruction, like abominable Scotch dogs.\r\n\r\nP. 199. [par. 244] _Clarendon_. In that very hour when he was thus\r\nwickedly murdered in the sight of the sun, he had as great a share in\r\nthe hearts and affections of his subjects ... as any of his\r\npredecessors.--_Swift_. Only common pity for his death, and the manner\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nP. 208. [par. 261] _Clarendon_, Lord Capel's trial:--_Cromwell,_ who had\r\nknown him very well, spoke so much good of him, and professed to have so\r\nmuch kindness and respect for him, that all men thought he was now\r\nsafe.--_Swift_. Cursed dog.\r\n\r\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\nP. 217. [par. 4.] _Clarendon_, Charles II. proclaimed in Scotland:\r\n--upon condition of \"his good behaviour, and strict observation of the\r\nCovenant, and his entertaining no other persons about him but such as\r\nwere godly men, and faithful to that obligation.\"--_Swift_ Cursed Scots\r\nin every circumstance.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 5.] _Clarendon_. The new Duke [of Hamilton].--_Swift_. A\r\nScotch duke, celebrated by the author: a perfect miracle.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [ditto.] _Clarendon_. A rare virtue in the men of that time.\r\n--_Swift._ [Of that] nation.\r\n\r\nP. 218. [par. 7.] _Clarendon_, on the commission sent to England when\r\nthe King was tried:--The Marquess of Argyle had had too deep a share in\r\nthat wickedness [the delivery of the King], to endure the shock of a new\r\ndispute, and inquisition upon that subject; and therefore gave not the\r\nleast opposition to their passion [of the Scots].--_Swift_. A true\r\nArgyle.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [continuation of the same sentence.] _Clarendon_. But seemed\r\nequally concerned in the honour of the nation, to prosecute an high\r\nexpostulation with those of England, for the breach of faith, and the\r\npromises, which had been made for the safety, and preservation of the\r\nKing's person, at the time he was delivered up.--_Swift_. The Scots were\r\nthe cause and chief instruments of the King's murder by delivering him\r\nup to the English rebels.\r\n\r\nP. 222. [par. 13.] _Clarendon_. It was very manifest ... that the\r\nMarquess of Argyle meant only to satisfy the people, in declaring that\r\nthey had a King ... but that such conditions should be put upon him, as\r\nhe knew, he would not submit to.--_Swift_. Most detestable villain.\r\n\r\nP. 224. [par. 17.] _Clarendon_. As soon as he came into the room where\r\nthey were.--_Swift_. Abominable Scotch dogs.\r\n\r\nP. 225. [ditto.] _Clarendon_. A learned and worthy Scottish divine, Dr.\r\nWishart.--_Swift_. A prodigious rarity.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 18.] _Clarendon_. The Earl [of Lauderdale] told him [one\r\nof the council] ... that he could not imagine, or conceive the\r\nbarbarities and inhumanities Montrose was guilty of, in the time he made\r\na war in Scotland.--_Swift_. That earl was a beast; I mean Lauderdale.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [ditto.] _Clarendon_. That he [Montrose] had in one battle\r\nkilled fifteen hundred of one family, of the Campbells, of the blood and\r\nname of Argyle.--_Swift_. Not half enough of that execrable breed.\r\n\r\nP. 228. [par. 24.] _Clarendon_, for the embassy from the Parliament:\r\n--one Dorislaus, a doctor in the civil law, was named.--_Swift_. A\r\nDutch fellow, employed by those regicides who murdered the King.\r\n\r\nP. 237. [par. 41.] _Clarendon_. The Prince of Orange ... wished, \"that,\r\nin regard of the great differences which were in England about matters\r\nof religion, the King would offer ... to refer all matters in\r\ncontroversy concerning religion to a national synod.\"--_Swift_. I do\r\nnot approve it.\r\n\r\nP. 249. [par. 69.] _Clarendon_, on the defeat of the Marquess of Ormonde\r\nby Jones.--_Swift_. Ormonde's army discomfited!\r\n\r\nP. 265. [par. 119.] _Clarendon_. And that Committee of the\r\nParliament.--_Swift_. Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 119.] _Clarendon_. The council of Scotland ... sent a\r\ngentleman ... to invite his Majesty again to come into his kingdom of\r\nScotland, not without a rude insinuation that it was the last invitation\r\nhe should receive.--_Swift_. Still cursed Scots.\r\n\r\nP. 267. [par. 122.] _Clarendon_, on the conditions sent from Scotland to\r\nBreda, in case the King consented to come to Scotland:--The King\r\nhimself, and all who should attend upon him, were first to sign the\r\nCovenant before they should be admitted to enter into the\r\nkingdom.--_Swift_. Damnable Scottish dogs.\r\n\r\nP. 268. [par. 125.] _Clarendon_, some lords warned the King, that it was\r\nto be feared that:--Argyle would immediately deliver up the person of\r\nthe King into the hands of Cromwell.--_Swift_. That Scotch dog was\r\nlikely enough to do so, and much worse.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 126.] _Clarendon_, the ambassadors in Spain:--were\r\nextremely troubled, both of them having always had a strong aversion\r\nthat the King should ever venture himself in the hands of that\r\nparty of the Scottish nation, which had treated his father so\r\nperfidiously.--_Swift_. Damnable nation for ever.\r\n\r\nP. 269. [par. 127.] _Clarendon_. [The King] was before [in Spain] looked\r\nupon as being dispossessed, and disinherited of all his dominions, as if\r\nhe had no more subjects than those few who were banished with him, and\r\nthat there was an entire defection in all the rest. But now that he was\r\npossessed of one whole kingdom, etc.--_Swift_. Yet all cursed villains;\r\na possession of the Devil's kingdom, where every Scot was a rebel.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 128.] _Clarendon_. There fell out at this time ... an\r\naccident of such a prodigious nature, that, if Providence had not, for\r\nthe reproach of Scotland, determined that the King should once more make\r\nexperiment of the courage and fidelity of that nation, could not but\r\nhave diverted his Majesty from that northern expedition; which, how\r\nunsecure soever it appeared to be for the King, was predestinated for a\r\ngreater chastisement and mortification of that people, as it shortly\r\nafter proved to be: [alluding to Montrose's execution.]--_Swift_. That\r\nis good news.\r\n\r\nP. 270. [par. 128.] _Clarendon_. The Marquess [of Montrose], who was\r\nnaturally full of great thoughts, and confident of success.--_Swift_.\r\nHe was the only man in Scotland who had ever one grain of virtue; and\r\nwas therefore abhorred, and murdered publicly by his hellish countrymen.\r\n\r\nP. 270. [par. 129.] _Clarendon_. There were many officers of good name\r\nand account in Sweden, of the Scottish nation.--_Swift_. Impossible.\r\n\r\nP. 271. [par. 130.] _Clarendon_. Montrose knew, that of the two factions\r\nthere, which were not like to be reconciled, each of them were equally\r\nhis implacable enemies.--_Swift_. Very certain.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [ditto.] _Clarendon_. The whole kirk ... being alike malicious\r\nto him.--_Swift._ Scots damnable kirk.\r\n\r\nP. 272. [par. 131]. _Clarendon_. Many of [the nobility] ... assured him\r\n[Montrose], that they would meet him with good numbers; and they did\r\nprepare to do so, some really; and others, with a purpose to betray\r\nhim.--_Swift_. Much the greater number.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 133.] _Clarendon_. The tyranny of Argyle ... caused very\r\nmany to be barbarously murdered, without any form of law or justice, who\r\nhad been in arms with Montrose.--_Swift_. That perpetual inhuman dog and\r\ntraitor, and all his posterity, to a man, damnable villains.\r\n\r\nP. 273. [par 134.] _Clarendon_ Most of the other officers were shortly\r\nafter taken prisoners, all the country desiring to merit from Argyle by\r\nbetraying all those into his hands which they believed to be his\r\nenemies.--_Swift_. The virtue and morality of the Scots.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [ditto] _Clarendon_. And thus, whether _by the owner of the\r\nhouse_ or any other way, the Marquess himself became their\r\nprisoner.--_Swift_. A tyrannical Scottish dog.\r\n\r\nP. 274. [par. 137.] _Clarendon_ \"That for the League and Covenant, he\r\nhad never taken it,\" etc.--_Swift_. The Devil, their God, I believe had\r\ntaken it. [This remark is nearly obliterated.]\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 138] _Clarendon_, sentence on Montrose:--That he was ...\r\nto be carried to Edinburgh Cross, and there to be hanged upon a gallows\r\nthirty foot high, for the space of three hours, etc.--_Swift_. Oh! if\r\nthe whole nation, to a man, were just so treated! begin with Argyle, and\r\nnext with the fanatic dogs who teased him with their kirk scurrilities.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 139.] _Clarendon_. After many such barbarities, they [the\r\nministers] offered to intercede for him to the kirk upon his repentance,\r\nand to pray with him.--_Swift_. Most treacherous, damnable, infernal\r\nScots for ever!\r\n\r\nP. 275. [par. 140] _Clarendon_. He bore it [the execution] with ill the\r\ncourage and magnanimity, and the greatest piety, that a good Christian\r\ncould manifest.--_Swift._ A perfect hero; wholly un-Scotified.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [ditto] _Clarendon_. [He] prayed, \"that they might not betray\r\nhim [the King], as they had done his father.\"--_Swift_. A very\r\nseasonable prayer, but never performed.\r\n\r\nP. 275. [par. 142.] _Clarendon_. The Marquess of Argyle ... wanted\r\nnothing but _honesty and courage_ to be a very extraordinary\r\nman.--_Swift_. Trifles to a Scot.\r\n\r\nP. 276. [par. 143.] _Clarendon_. They who were most displeased with\r\nArgyle and his faction, were not sorry for this inhuman, and monstrous\r\nprosecution [of Montrose].--_Swift_. Impudent, lying Scottish dogs.\r\n\r\nBOOK XIII.\r\n\r\nP. 285. [par. 1.] _Clarendon_. Without he likewise consented to\r\nthose.--_Swift_. Bad.\r\n\r\nP. 286. [par. 3.] _Clarendon_. The King was received by the Marquess of\r\nArgyle with all the outward respect imaginable.--_Swift_. That dog of\r\nall Scotch dogs.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [ditto.] _Clarendon_. They did immediately banish him [Daniel\r\nO'Neill] the kingdom, and obliged him to sign a paper, by which he\r\nconsented to be put to death, if he were ever after found in the\r\nkingdom.--_Swift_. In Scotland, with a pox.\r\n\r\nP. 287. [par. 5.] _Clarendon_. The King's table was well served.\r\n--_Swift_. With Scotch food, etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\nP. 300. [par 36.] _Clarendon_. The King had left ... the Duke of York\r\nwith the Queen, with direction \"that he should conform himself entirely\r\nto the will and pleasure of the Queen his mother, matters of religion\r\nonly excepted.\"--_Swift_. Yet lost his kingdom for the sake of Popery.\r\n\r\nP. 301. [par. 37.] _Clarendon_. The Duke [of York] was full of spirit\r\nand courage, and naturally loved designs.--_Swift. Quantum mutatus!_\r\n\r\nP. 304. [par. 42.] _Clarendon_, on the proposed match between the Duke\r\nof York, and the Duke of Lorraine's natural daughter:--Only Sir George\r\nRatcliffe undertook to speak to him about it, who could only make\r\nhimself understood in Latin, which the Duke cared not to speak\r\nin.--_Swift_. Because he was illiterate, and only read Popish Latin.\r\n\r\nP. 305. [par. 44.] _Clarendon_. [The Queen] bid him [the chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer] \"assure the Duke of York, that he should have a free\r\nexercise of his religion, as he had before.\"--_Swift_. Who unkinged\r\nhimself for Popery.\r\n\r\nP. 306. [par. 45.] _Clarendon_. It was indeed the common discourse there\r\n[in Holland], \"that the Protestants of the Church of England could never\r\ndo the King service, but that all his hopes must be in the Roman\r\nCatholics, and the Presbyterians.\"--_Swift_. A blessed pair.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_. [par. 46.] _Clarendon_. [The Duke of York] was fortified with, a\r\nfirm resolution never to acknowledge that he had committed any\r\nerror.--_Swift_. No, not when he lost his kingdom or Popery.\r\n\r\nP. 311. [par. 58.] _Clarendon_. The King had ... friendship with Duke\r\nHamilton.--_Swift. Vix intelligo_.\r\n\r\nP. 318. [par. 75.] _Clarendon_, the King's defeat at Worcester, 3d of\r\nSeptember.--_Swift_. September 3d, always lucky to Cromwell.\r\n\r\nP. 339. [par. 122.] _Clarendon_. There was no need of spurs to be\r\nemployed to incite the Duke [of York]; who was most impatient to be in\r\nthe army.--_Swift_ How old was he when he turned a Papist, and a coward?\r\n\r\nP. 340. [par. 123.] _Clarendon_. The Duke pressed it [his being allowed\r\nto join the army] with earnestness and passion, in which he dissembled\r\nnot.--_Swift. Dubitat Augustinus_.\r\n\r\nP. 343. [par. 128.] _Clarendon_, the Duke, in the French army:--got the\r\nreputation of a prince of very signal courage, and to be universally\r\nbeloved of the whole army by his affable behaviour.--_Swift_. But\r\nproved a cowardly Popish king.\r\n\r\nP. 348, line 50. _Swift_. Scots.\r\n\r\nP, 349. [par. 140.] _Clarendon_. The chancellor ... told his Majesty,\r\n\"this trust would for ever deprive him of all hope of the Queen's\r\nfavour; who could not but discern it within three or four days, and, by\r\nthe frequent resort of the Scottish vicar [one Knox; who came with\r\nMiddleton to Paris,] to him\" (who had the vanity to desire long\r\nconferences with him) \"that there was some secret in hand which was kept\r\nfrom her.\"--_Swift_. The little Scottish scoundrel, conceited vicar.\r\n\r\nBOOK XIV.\r\n\r\nP. 386. [par. 41.] _Clarendon_. Scotland lying under a heavy yoke by the\r\nstrict government of Monk.--_Swift_. I am glad of that.\r\n\r\nP. 387. [par. 44.] _Clarendon_. The day of their meeting [Cromwell's\r\nParliament] was the third of September in the year 1654.--_Swift_. His\r\nlucky day.\r\n\r\nP. 394. [par. 56.] _Clarendon_. The Highlanders ... made frequent\r\nincursions in the night into the English quarters; and killed many of\r\ntheir soldiers, but stole more of their horses.--_Swift_. Rank Scottish\r\nthieves.\r\n\r\nP. 413. [par. 95.] _Clarendon_. A bold person to publish, etc.--\r\n_Swift_. Bussy Rabutin, Amours des Gaules.\r\n\r\nP. 414. [par. 96.] _Clarendon_. There was at that time in the court of\r\nFrance, or rather in the jealousy of that court, a lady of great beauty,\r\nof a presence very graceful and alluring, and a wit and behaviour that\r\ncaptivated those who were admitted into her presence; [to whom Charles\r\nII. made an offer of marriage]--_Swift_. A prostitute whore.\r\n\r\nP. 420. [par. 109.] _Clarendon_. The chancellor of the exchequer one day\r\n... desired him [the king] \"to consider upon this news, and importunity\r\nfrom Scotland, whether in those Highlands there might not be such a safe\r\nretreat and residence, that he might reasonably say, that with the\r\naffections of that people, which had been always firm both to his father\r\nand himself, he might preserve himself in safety, though he could not\r\nhope to make any advance.\"--_Swift_. The chancellor never thought so\r\nwell of the Scots before.\r\n\r\n_Ibid_, [ditto.] _Clarendon_. His Majesty discoursed very calmly of that\r\ncountry, ... \"that, if sickness did not destroy him, which he had reason\r\nto expect from the ill accommodation he must be there contented with, he\r\nshould in a short time be betrayed and given up\"--_Swift_. But the King\r\nknew them better.\r\n\r\nP. 425. [par. 118.] _Clarendon_. [The King's enemies] persuaded many in\r\nEngland, and especially of those of the reformed religion abroad, that\r\nhis Majesty was in truth a Papist.--_Swift_. Which was true.\r\n\r\nP. 443.[8] _Clarendon_. The wretch [Manning], soon after, received the\r\nreward due to his treason.--_Swift_. In what manner?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This sentence, which follows at the end of par. 146, is\r\nomitted in the edition of 1888. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBOOK XV.\r\n\r\nP. 469. [par. 53.] _Clarendon._ That which made a noise indeed, and\r\ncrowned his [Cromwell's] successes, was the victory his fleet, under the\r\ncommand of Blake, had obtained over the Spaniard.--_Swift_.

[par. 119, sec. 3,] _Clarendon_, in the address of the\r\nAnabaptists to the King:--\"We ... humbly beseech your Majesty, that you\r\nwould engage your royal word never to erect, nor suffer to be erected,\r\nany such tyrannical, Popish, and Antichristian hierarchy (Episcopal,\r\nPresbyterian, or by what name soever it be called) as shall assume a\r\npower over, or impose a yoke upon, the consciences of others.\"--_Swift_.\r\nHonest, though fanatics.\r\n\r\nP. 501. [par. 136.] _Clarendon_, at the siege of Dunkirk:--Marshal\r\nTurenne, accompanied with the Duke of York, who would never be absent\r\nupon those occasions, ... spent two or three days in viewing the line\r\nround,--_Swift_. James II., a fool and a coward.\r\n\r\nP. 502. [par. 137.] _Clarendon_. There was a rumour.., that the Duke of\r\nYork was taken prisoner by the English, ... whereupon many of the French\r\nofficers, and gentlemen, resolved to set him at liberty; ... So great an\r\naffection that nation owned to have for his Highness.--_Swift_. Yet he\r\nlived and died a coward.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVI.\r\n\r\nP. 523.

[par. 199.] _Clarendon_, Letter to the fleet:--\"Which gives us\r\ngreat encouragement and hope, that God Almighty will heal the wounds by\r\nthe same plaster that made the flesh raw.\"--_Swift_.

Mr.\r\nOsmund Airy is at present engaged on a new edition for the Clarendon\r\nPress, but so far only two volumes have been published. It was in Dr.\r\nRouth's edition that almost all of Swift's notes first appeared. In the\r\nPreface to the issue of 1823, the learned editor informs us that Swift's\r\nnotes were taken \"from his own copy of the history, which had come into\r\nthe possession of the first Marquis of Lansdowne.\" A note in the edition\r\nof 1833 corrects a statement made in the previous edition that Swift's\r\ncopy had been burnt. It was not Swift's own copy, but a copy containing\r\na transcript of Swift's notes that was burnt.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the present text every available reference has\r\nbeen searched. Sir Walter Scott's reprint of Swift's \"Notes\" was sadly\r\ninadequate. Not only did he misquote the references to Burnet's work,\r\nbut he could not have consulted the Lansdowne copy, since fully a third\r\nof the \"notes\" were altogether ignored by him. It is believed that the\r\ntext here given contains every note accurately placed to its proper\r\naccount in Burnet's \"History.\" The references are to the edition in\r\nfolio issued in 1724-1734.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-seventh volume of the \"European Magazine,\" and in the two\r\nfollowing volumes, a fair proportion of Swift's notes were first\r\npublished. These were reprinted by Dr. Burnet in 1808, in his \"Essay on\r\nthe Earlier Part of the Life of Swift.\" Both these authorities have been\r\nconsulted. Dr. Routh's modesty forbade him including six of the notes,\r\nbecause they were \"not written with the requisite decorum.\" These have\r\nbeen included here. Mr. Osmund Airy has \"thought it unadvisable to\r\nencumber the pages with simple terms of abuse\"; but an editor of Swift's\r\nworks cannot permit himself this licence. His duty is to include\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThe text of the \"Short Remarks\" is taken from vol. viii., Part 1, of the\r\nquarto edition of Swift's works, edited by Deane Swift, and published in\r\n1765.\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SHORT REMARKS ON\r\n  BISHOP BURNET'S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis author is in most particulars the worst qualified for an historian\r\nthat ever I met with. His style is rough, full of improprieties, in\r\nexpressions often Scotch, and often such as are used by the meanest\r\npeople.[1] He discovers a great scarcity of words and phrases, by\r\nrepeating the same several hundred times, for want of capacity to vary\r\nthem. His observations are mean and trite, and very often false. His\r\nsecret history is generally made up of coffeehouse scandals, or at best\r\nfrom reports at the third, fourth, or fifth hand. The account of the\r\nPretender's birth, would only become an old woman in a chimney-corner.\r\nHis vanity runs intolerably through the whole book, affecting to have\r\nbeen of consequence at nineteen years old, and while he was a little\r\nScotch parson of forty pounds a year. He was a gentleman born, and, in\r\nthe time of his youth and vigour, drew in an old maiden daughter of a\r\nScotch earl to marry him.[2] His characters are miserably wrought, in\r\nmany things mistaken, and all of them detracting,[3] except of those who\r\nwere friends to the Presbyterians. That early love of liberty he boasts\r\nof is absolutely false; for the first book that I believe he ever\r\npublished is an entire treatise in favour of passive obedience and\r\nabsolute power; so that his reflections on the clergy, for asserting,\r\nand then changing those principles, come very improperly from him. He is\r\nthe most partial of all writers that ever pretended so much to\r\nimpartiality; and yet I, who knew him well, am convinced that he is as\r\nimpartial as he could possibly find in his heart; I am sure more than I\r\never expected from him; particularly in his accounts of the Papist and\r\nfanatic plots. This work may be more properly called \"A History of\r\nScotland during the Author's Time, with some Digressions relating to\r\nEngland,\" rather than deserve the title he gives it. For I believe two\r\nthirds of it relate only to that beggarly nation, and their\r\ninsignificant brangles and factions. What he succeeds best in, is in\r\ngiving extracts of arguments and debates in council or Parliament.\r\nNothing recommends his book but the recency of the facts he mentions,\r\nmost of them being still in memory, especially the story of the\r\nRevolution; which, however, is not so well told as might be expected\r\nfrom one who affects to have had so considerable a share in it. After\r\nall, he was a man of generosity and good nature, and very communicative;\r\nbut, in his ten last years, was absolutely party-mad, and fancied he saw\r\nPopery under every bush. He hath told me many passages not mentioned in\r\nthis history, and many that are, but with several circumstances\r\nsuppressed or altered. He never gives a good character without one\r\nessential point, that the person was tender to Dissenters, and thought\r\nmany things in the Church ought to be amended.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"His own opinion,\" says my predecessor, Mr Nichols, \"was\r\nvery different, as appears by the original MS of his History, wherein\r\nthe following lines are legible, though among those which were ordered\r\nnot to be printed 'And if I have arrived at any faculty of writing\r\nclearly and correctly, I owe that entirely to them [Tillotson and\r\nLloyd]. For as they joined with Wilkins, in that noble, though despised\r\nattempt, of an _universal character_, and a philosophical language; they\r\ntook great pains to observe all the common errors of language in\r\ngeneral, and of ours in particular. And in the drawing the tables for\r\nthat work, which was Lloyd's province, he looked further into a natural\r\npurity and simplicity of style, than any man I ever knew; into all which\r\nhe led me, and so helped me to any measure of exactness of writing,\r\nwhich may be thought to belong to me.' The above was originally designed\r\nto have followed the words, 'I know from them,' vol. i. p. 191, 1. 7,\r\nfol. ed. near the end of A.D. 1661.\" [S]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lady Margaret Kennedy, daughter to the Earl of Cassilis.\r\n[S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A note in Swift's Works, vol. ix., pt. ii. [1775] says:\r\nAfter \"detracting,\" add \"Many of which were stricken through with his\r\nown hand, but left legible in the MS.; which he ordered, in his last\r\nwill, 'his executor to print faithfully, as he left it, without adding,\r\nsuppressing, or altering it in any particular.' In the second volume,\r\nJudge Burnet, the Bishop's son and executor, promises that 'the original\r\nmanuscript of both volumes shall be deposited in the Cotton Library.'\r\nBut this promise does not appear to have been fulfilled; at least it\r\ncertainly was not in 1736, when two letters were printed, addressed to\r\nThomas Burnet, Esq. In p. 8 of the Second Letter, the writer [Philip\r\nBeach] asserted, that he had in his own possession 'an authentic and\r\ncomplete collection of the castrated passages.'\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n_Setting up for a maxim, laying down for a maxim, clapt up, decency,_\r\nand some other words and phrases, he uses many hundred times.\r\n\r\n_Cut out for a court, a pardoning planet, clapt up, left in the lurch,\r\nthe mob, outed, a great beauty, went roundly to work:_ All these phrases\r\nused by the vulgar, shew him to have kept mean or illiterate company in\r\nhis youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON BURNET'S HISTORY OF HIS OWN TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE, p. 3. _Burnet._\r\n\r\nIndeed the peevishness, the ill nature, and the ambition of many\r\nclergymen has sharpened my spirits perhaps too much against them; so I\r\n_warn_ my reader to take all that I say on these heads with some grains\r\nof allowance.--_Swift._ I will take his _warning._\r\n\r\nP. 4. _Burnet._ Over and over again retouched and polished by\r\nme.--_Swift._ Rarely polished; I never read so ill a style.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ That thereby I may awaken the world to just reflections\r\non their own errors and follies.--_Swift._ This I take to be nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nP. 6. _Burnet._ That king saw that those who were most in his interests\r\nwere likewise jealous of his authority, and apt to encroach upon\r\nit.--_Swift._ Nonsense.\r\n\r\nP. 10. _Burnet_ says that competent provision to those who served the\r\ncure:--was afterwards in his son's time raised to about fifty pounds a\r\nyear.--_Swift._ Scotch pounds, I suppose.\r\n\r\nP. 11. _Burnet._ Colonel Titus assured me that he had from King Charles\r\nthe First's own mouth, that he was well assured he [Prince Henry] was\r\npoisoned by the Earl of Somerset's means.--_Swift._ Titus was the\r\ngreatest rogue in England.\r\n\r\nP. 18. _Burnet_ says that Gowry's conspiracy against King James was\r\nconfirmed to him by his father.--_Swift._ Melvil makes nothing of it.\r\n\r\nP. 20. _Burnet._ I turn now to the affairs of Scotland, which are but\r\nlittle known.--_Swift._ Not worth knowing.\r\n\r\nP. 23. _Burnet,_ Archbishop Spotswood began:--his journey as he\r\noften did on a Sunday, which was a very odious thing in that\r\ncountry.--_Swift._ Poor malice.\r\n\r\nP. 24. _Burnet,_ Mr. Steward, a private gentleman, became:--so\r\nconsiderable that he was raised by several degrees to be made Earl of\r\nTraquair and Lord-Treasurer [of Scotland], and was in great favour; but\r\nsuffered afterwards such a reverse of fortune, that I saw him so low\r\nthat he wanted bread, ... and it was believed died of hunger.--_Swift._\r\nA strange death: perhaps it was of want of _meat_.\r\n\r\nP. 26. _Burnet._ My father ... carefully preserved the petition itself,\r\nand the papers relating to the trial [of Lord Balmerinoch]; of which I\r\nnever saw any copy besides those which I have. ... The whole record ...\r\nis indeed a very noble piece, full of curious matter.--_Swift._ Puppy.\r\n\r\nP. 28. _Burnet._ The Earl of Argyle was a more solemn sort of man, grave\r\nand sober, free of all scandalous vices.--_Swift._ As a man is free of a\r\ncorporation, he means.\r\n\r\nP. 29. _Burnet._ The Lord Wharton and the Lord Howard of Escrick\r\nundertook to deliver some of these; which they did, and were _clapt up_\r\nupon it.--_Swift._ Dignity of expression.\r\n\r\nP. 30. _Burnet._ [King Charles I.] was now in great straits ... his\r\ntreasure was now exhausted; his subjects were highly irritated; the\r\nministry were all frighted, being exposed to the anger and justice of\r\nthe Parliament. ... He loved high and rough methods, but had neither the\r\nskill to conduct them, nor the height of genius to manage\r\nthem.--_Swift._ Not one good quality named.\r\n\r\nP. 31. _Burnet._ The Queen [of Charles I.] was a woman of great vivacity\r\nin conversation, and loved all her life long to be _in intrigues of all\r\nsorts._--_Swift._ Not of love, I hope.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ By the concessions that he made, especially that of the\r\ntriennial Parliament, the honest and quiet part of the nation was\r\nsatisfied, and thought their religion and liberties were secured: So\r\nthey broke off from those violenter propositions that occasioned the\r\nwar.--_Swift._ Dark, or nonsense.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ He intended not to stand to them any longer than he lay\r\nunder that force that visibly drew them from him contrary to his own\r\ninclinations.--_Swift._ Sad trash.\r\n\r\nP. 33. _Burnet._ The first volume of the Earl of Clarendon's \"History\"\r\ngives a faithful representation of the beginnings of the troubles,\r\nthough writ in favour of the court.--_Swift._ Writ with the spirit of an\r\nhistorian, not of [a raker] into scandal.\r\n\r\nP. 34. _Burnet._ Dickson, Blair, Rutherford, Baily, Cant, and the two\r\nGillispys ... affected great sublimities in devotion: They poured\r\nthemselves out in their prayers with a loud voice, and often with many\r\ntears. They had but an ordinary proportion of learning among them;\r\nsomething of Hebrew, and very little Greek: Books of controversy with\r\nPapists, but above all with the Arminians, was the height of their\r\nstudy.--_Swift._ Great nonsense. Rutherford was half fool, half mad.\r\n\r\nP. 40. _Burnet,_ speaking of the bad effects of the Marquess of\r\nMontrose's expedition and defeat, says:--It alienated the Scots much\r\nfrom the King: It exalted all that were enemies to peace. Now they\r\nseemed to have some colour for all those aspersions they had cast on the\r\nKing, as if he had been in a correspondence with the Irish rebels, when\r\nthe worst tribe of them had been thus employed by him.--_Swift._ Lord\r\nClarendon differs from all this.\r\n\r\nP. 41. _Burnet._ The Earl of Essex told me, that he had taken all the\r\npains he could to enquire into the original of the Irish massacre, but\r\ncould never see any reason to believe the King had any accession to\r\nit.--_Swift._ And who but _a beast_ ever believed it?\r\n\r\nP. 42. _Burnet,_ arguing with the Scots concerning the propriety of the\r\nKing's death, observes:--Drummond said, \"Cromwell had plainly the better\r\nof them at their own weapon.\"--_Swift._ And Burnet thought as Cromwell\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nP. 46. _Burnet._ They [the army] will ever keep the Parliament in\r\nsubjection to them, and so keep up their own authority.--_Swift._ Weak.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ Fairfax was much distracted in his mind, and changed\r\npurposes often every day.--_Swift._ Fairfax had hardly common sense.\r\n\r\nP. 49. _Burnet._ I will not enter farther into the military part: For I\r\nremember an advice of Marshal Schomberg's, never to meddle in the\r\nrelation of military matters.--_Swift._ Very foolish advice, for\r\nsoldiers cannot write.\r\n\r\nP. 50. _Burnet._ [Laud's] defence of himself, writ ... when he was in\r\nthe Tower, is a very mean performance. ... In most particulars he\r\nexcuses himself by this, that he was but one of many, who either in\r\ncouncil, star-chamber, or high commission voted illegal things. Now\r\nthough this was true, yet a chief minister, and one in high favour,\r\ndetermines the rest so much, that they are generally little better than\r\nmachines acted by him. On other occasions he says, the thing was proved\r\nbut by one witness. Now, how strong soever this defence may be in law,\r\nit is of no force in an appeal to the world; for if a thing is true, it\r\nis no matter how full or how defective the proof is.--_Swift._ All this\r\nis full of malice and ill judgement.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet,_ speaking of the \"Eikon Basilike,\" supposed to be written\r\nby Charles the First, says:--There was in it a nobleness and justness of\r\nthought with a greatness of style, that made it to be looked on as the\r\nbest writ book in the English language.--_Swift._ I think it a poor\r\ntreatise, and that the King did not write it.\r\n\r\nP. 51. _Burnet._ Upon the King's death the Scots proclaimed his son\r\nKing, and sent over Sir George Wincam, _that married my great-aunt_, to\r\ntreat with him while he was in the Isle of Jersey.--_Swift._ Was that\r\nthe reason he was sent?\r\n\r\nP. 53. _Burnet._ I remember in one fast-day there were six sermons\r\npreached without intermission. I was there myself, and not a little\r\nweary of so tedious a service.--_Swift._ Burnet was not then eight years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nP. 61. _Burnet,_ speaking of the period of the usurpation in\r\nScotland:--Cromwell built three citadels, at Leith, Ayr, and Inverness,\r\nbesides many little forts. There was good justice done, and vice was\r\nsuppressed and punished; so that we always reckon those eight years of\r\nusurpation a time of great peace and prosperity.--_Swift._ No doubt you\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nP. 63. _Burnet,_ speaking of the Scotch preachers at sacrament times\r\nduring the civil wars, says:--The crowds were far beyond the capacity of\r\ntheir churches, or the reach of their voices.--_Swift._ I believe the\r\nchurch had as much capacity as the minister.\r\n\r\nP. 64. _Burnet._ The resolutioners sent up one Sharp, who had been long\r\nin England, and was an active and eager man.--_Swift._ Afterwards\r\narchbishop, and murdered.\r\n\r\nP. 66. _Burnet._ Thus Cromwell had all the King's party in a net. He let\r\nthem dance in it at pleasure. And upon occasions _clapt_ them up for a\r\nshort while.--_Swift._ Pox of his _claps_.\r\n\r\nP. 87. _Burnet,_ speaking of the Restoration:--Of all this Monk had both\r\nthe praise and the reward, though I have been told a very small share of\r\nit belonged to him.--_Swift._ Malice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nP. 92. _Burnet._ I will therefore enlarge ... on the affairs of\r\nScotland; both out of the inbred love that all men have for their native\r\ncountry, etc.--_Swift._ Could not he keep his inbred love to himself?\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ Sharp, who was employed by the resolutioners ... stuck\r\nneither at solemn protestations, ... nor at appeals to God of his\r\nsincerity in acting for the presbytery both in prayers and on other\r\noccasions, etc.--_Swift._ Sure there was some secret personal cause of\r\nall this malice against Sharp.\r\n\r\nP. 93. _Burnet,_ speaking of Charles II. says:--He was affable and easy,\r\nand loved to be made so by all about him. The great art of keeping him\r\nlong was, the being easy, and the making everything easy to\r\nhim.--_Swift._ Eloquence.\r\n\r\nP. 99. _Burnet_ says of Bennet, afterwards Earl of Arlington:--His parts\r\nwere solid, but not quick.--_Swift._ They were very quick.\r\n\r\nP. 100. _Burnet_ says of the Duke of Buckingham:--Pleasure, frolic, or\r\nextravagant diversion was all that he laid to heart. He was true to\r\nnothing, for he was not true to himself.--_Swift._ No consequence.\r\n_Burnet._ He had no steadiness nor conduct: He could keep no secret, nor\r\nexecute any design without spoiling it.--_Swift._ Nonsense.\r\n\r\nP. 117. _Burnet._ It was visible that neither the late King nor the\r\npresent were under any force when they passed ... those Acts [bringing\r\nin Presbyterian government].--_Swift._ Both Kings were under a force.\r\n\r\nP. 118. _Burnet._ To annul a Parliament was a terrible precedent, which\r\ndestroyed the whole security of government.--_Swift._ Wrong arguing.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ Distress on his affairs was really equivalent to a force\r\non his person.--_Swift._ It was so.\r\n\r\nP. 119. _Burnet._ We went into it, he said, as knaves, and therefore no\r\nwonder if we miscarried in it as fools.--_Swift._ True.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ No government was so well established, as not to be\r\nliable to a revolution. This [the Rescissory Act] would cut off all\r\nhopes of peace and submission, if any disorder should happen at any time\r\nthereafter.--_Swift._ Wrong weak reasoning.\r\n\r\nP. 120. _Burnet._ Such care was taken that no public application should\r\nbe made in favour of Presbytery. Any attempt that was made on the other\r\nhand met with great encouragement.--_Swift._ Does the man write like a\r\nbishop?\r\n\r\nP. 126. _Burnet,_ speaking of the execution of the Marquess of\r\nArgyle:--After some time spent in his private devotions he was\r\nbeheaded.--_Swift._ He was the greatest villain of his age.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ The kirk ... asserted all along that the doctrine\r\ndelivered in their sermons did not fall under the cognisance of the\r\ntemporal courts, till it was first judged by the church.--_Swift._\r\nPopery.\r\n\r\nP. 127. _Burnet._ The proceedings against Wariston were soon\r\ndispatched.--_Swift._ Wariston was an abominable dog.\r\n\r\nP. 135. _Burnet,_ of Bishop Leightoun's character:--The grace and\r\ngravity of his pronunciation was such, that few heard him without a very\r\nsensible emotion. ... His style was rather too fine.--_Swift._ Burnet is\r\nnot guilty of that.\r\n\r\nP. 140. _Burnet._ Leightoun did not stand much upon it. He did not\r\n_think_ orders given without bishops were null and void. He _thought_,\r\nthe forms of government were not settled by such positive laws as were\r\nunalterable; but only by apostolical practices, which, as he _thought_,\r\nauthorized Episcopacy as the best form. Yet he did not _think_ it\r\nnecessary to the being of a church. But he _thought_ that every church\r\nmight make such rules of ordination as they pleased.--_Swift. Think,\r\nthought, thought, think, thought._\r\n\r\nP. 154. _Burnet,_ speaking of a proclamation for shutting up two hundred\r\nchurches in one day:--Sharp said to myself, that he knew nothing of it.\r\n... He was glad that this was done without his having any share in it:\r\nFor by it he was furnished with somewhat, in which he was no way\r\nconcerned, upon which he might cast all the blame of all that followed.\r\nYet this was suitable enough to a maxim that he and all that sort of\r\npeople set up, that the execution of laws was that by which all\r\ngovernments maintained their strength, as well as their\r\nhonour.--_Swift._ Dunce, can there be a better maxim?\r\n\r\nP. 157. _Burnet,_ speaking of those who enforced church discipline,\r\nsays:--They had a very scanty measure of learning, and a narrow compass\r\nin it. They were little men, of a very indifferent size of capacity, and\r\napt to fly out into great excess of passion and indiscretion.--_Swift._\r\nStrange inconsistent stuff.\r\n\r\nP. 160. _Burnet._ One Venner ... thought it was not enough to believe\r\nthat Christ was to reign on earth, and to put the saints in the\r\npossession of the kingdom ... but added to this, that the saints were to\r\ntake the kingdom themselves.--_Swift._ This wants grammar.\r\n\r\nP. 163. _Burnet._ John Goodwin and Milton did also escape all censure,\r\nto the surprise of all people.--_Swift._ He censures even mercy.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ Milton ... was ... much admired by all at home for the\r\npoems he writ, though he was then blind; chiefly that of \"Paradise\r\nLost,\" in which there is a nobleness both of contrivance and execution,\r\nthat, though he affected to write in blank verse without rhyme, and made\r\nmany new and rough words, yet it was esteemed the beautifullest\r\nand perfectest poem that ever was writ, at least in _our_\r\nlanguage.--_Swift._ A mistake, for it is _in English._\r\n\r\nP. 164. _Burnet._ The great share he [Sir Henry Vane] had in the\r\nattainder of the Earl Strafford, and in the whole turn of affairs to the\r\ntotal change of government, but above all the great opinion that was had\r\nof his parts and capacity to embroil matters again, made the court think\r\nit was necessary to put him out of the way.--_Swift._ A malicious turn.\r\nVane was a dangerous enthusiastic beast.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ When he [Sir Henry Vane] saw his death was designed, he\r\ncomposed himself to it, with a resolution that surprised all who knew\r\nhow little of that was natural to him. Some instances of this were very\r\nextraordinary, though they cannot be mentioned with _decency_.--_Swift._\r\nHis lady _conceived_ of him the night before his execution.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ Sir Henry Vane died with so much composedness, that it\r\nwas generally thought, the government had lost more than it had gained\r\nby his death.--_Swift._ Vane was beheaded for new attempts, not here\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nP. 179. _Burnet._ [The Papists] seemed zealous for the Church. But at\r\nthe same time they spoke of toleration, as necessary both for the peace\r\nand quiet of the nation, and for the encouragement of trade.--_Swift._\r\nThis is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nP. 180. _Burnet_ says that Mr. Baxter:--was a man of great piety; and,\r\nif he had not meddled in too many things, would have been esteemed one\r\nof the learned men of the age: He writ near _two hundred\r\nbooks._--_Swift._ Very sad ones.\r\n\r\nP. 184. _Burnet._ The Convocation that prepared those alterations, as\r\nthey added some new holy days, St. Barnabas, and the Conversion of St.\r\nPaul, so they took in more lessons out of the Apocrypha, in particular\r\nthe story of Bel and the Dragon.--_Swift._ I think they acted wrong.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ Reports were spread ... of the plots of the\r\nPresbyterians in several counties. Many were taken up on those reports:\r\nBut none were ever tried for them.--_Swift._ A common practice.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet,_ writing of the ejection of the Nonconformists on St.\r\nBartholomew's Day, 1662, says:--A severity neither practised by Queen\r\nElizabeth in the enacting her Liturgy, nor by Cromwell in ejecting the\r\nRoyalists.--_Swift._ But by King William.\r\n\r\nP. 186. _Burnet,_ speaking of the great fines raised on the church\r\nestates ill applied, proceeds:--If the half had been applied to the\r\nbuying of tithes or glebes for small vicarages, here a foundation had\r\nbeen laid down for a great and effectual reformation.--_Swift._ He\r\njudges here right, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet,_ continuing the same subject:--The men of merit and\r\nservice were loaded with many livings and many dignities. With this\r\ngreat accession of wealth there broke in upon the Church a great deal of\r\nluxury and high living, on the pretence of hospitality; while others\r\nmade purchases, and left great estates, most of which we have seen melt\r\naway.--_Swift._ Uncharitable aggravation; a base innuendo.\r\n\r\nP. 189. _Burnet._ Patrick was a great preacher. He wrote ... well, and\r\nchiefly on the Scriptures. He was a laborious man in his function, of\r\ngreat strictness of life, but a little too severe against those who\r\ndiffered from him. But that was, when he thought their doctrines struck\r\nat the fundamentals of religion. He became afterwards more\r\nmoderate.--_Swift._ Yes, for he turned a rank Whig.\r\n\r\nP. 190. _Burnet._ [Archbishop Tenison] was a very learned man.--_Swift._\r\nThe dullest, good-for-nothing man I ever knew.\r\n\r\nP. 191. _Burnet,_ condemning the bad style of preaching before\r\nTillotson, Lloyd, and Stillingfleet, says their discourses were:--long\r\nand heavy, when all was _pie-bald_, full of many sayings of different\r\nlanguages.--_Swift._ A noble epithet. _Burnet._ The King ... had got a\r\nright notion of style.--_Swift._ How came Burnet not to learn this\r\nstyle?\r\n\r\nP. 193. _Burnet,_ speaking of the first formation of the Royal\r\nSociety:--Many physicians, and other ingenious men went into the society\r\nfor natural philosophy. But he who laboured most ... was Robert Boyle,\r\nthe Earl of Cork's youngest son. He was looked on by all who knew him as\r\na very perfect pattern. ... He neglected his person, despised the\r\nworld, and lived abstracted from all pleasures, designs, and\r\ninterests.--_Swift._ Boyle was a very silly writer.\r\n\r\nP. 195. _Burnet._ Peter Walsh, ... who was the honestest and learnedest\r\nman I ever knew among [the Popish clergy, often told me] ... there was\r\nnothing which the whole Popish party feared more than an union of those\r\nof the Church of England with the Presbyterians. ... The Papists had two\r\nmaxims, from which they never departed: The one was to divide us: And\r\nthe other was to keep themselves united.--_Swift._ Rogue.\r\n\r\nP. 202. _Burnet._ The queen-mother had brought over from France one Mrs.\r\nSteward, reckoned a very _great beauty._--_Swift._ A pretty phrase.\r\n\r\nP. 203. _Burnet._ One of the first things that was done in this session\r\nof Parliament [1663] was _the execution of my unfortunate uncle,\r\nWariston._--_Swift._ Was he hanged or beheaded? A fit uncle for such a\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\nP. 211. _Burnet._ Many were undone by it [religious persecution], and\r\nwent over to the Scots in Ulster, where they were well received, and had\r\nall manner of liberty as to their way of religion.--_Swift._ The more\r\nthe pity.\r\n\r\nP. 214. _Burnet._ The blame of all this was cast upon Sharp..... And the\r\nLord Lauderdale, to complete his disgrace with the King, got many of his\r\nletters ... and laid these before the King; So that the King looked on\r\nhim as one of the worst of men.--_Swift._ Surely there was some secret\r\ncause for this perpetual malice against Sharp.\r\n\r\nP. 220. _Burnet._ Pensionary De Witt had the notions of a commonwealth\r\nfrom the Greeks and Romans. And from them he came to fancy, that an army\r\ncommanded by officers of their own country was both more in their own\r\npower, and would serve them with the more zeal, since they themselves\r\nhad such an interest in their success.--_Swift._ He ought to have judged\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nP. 236. _Burnet,_ speaking of the slight rebellion in the west of\r\nScotland, 1666, says:--The rest [of the rebels] were favoured by the\r\ndarkness of the night, and the weariness of the King's troops that were\r\nnot in case to pursue them. ... For they were a poor harmless company of\r\nmen, become mad by oppression.--_Swift._  A fair historian!\r\n\r\nP. 237. _Burnet._ They might all have saved their lives, if they would\r\nhave renounced the Covenant: So they were really a sort of martyrs for\r\nit.--_Swift._ Decent term.\r\n\r\nP. 238. _Burnet._ [Sir John Cunningham] was not only very learned in the\r\ncivil and canon law ... [but] was above all, a man of eminent probity,\r\nand of a sweet temper, and indeed one of the _piousest_ men of the\r\nnation.--_Swift._ Is that Scotch?\r\n\r\nP. 242. _Burnet._ When the peace of Breda was concluded, the King wrote\r\nto the Scottish council, and communicated _that_ to them; and with\r\n_that_ signified, _that_ it was his pleasure _that_ the army should be\r\ndisbanded.--_Swift._ Four _thats_ in one line.\r\n\r\nP. 243. _Burnet._ [Archbishop Burnet] saw Episcopacy was to be pulled\r\ndown, and ... writ upon these matters a long and sorrowful letter to\r\nSheldon: And upon that Sheldon writ a very long one to Sir R. Murray;\r\nwhich I read, and found more temper and moderation in it than I could\r\nhave expected from him.--_Swift._ Sheldon was a very great and excellent\r\nman.\r\n\r\nP. 245. _Burnet._ [The Countess of Dysert] was a woman of great beauty,\r\nbut of far greater parts. ... She had studied not only divinity and\r\nhistory, but mathematics and philosophy. She was violent in everything\r\nshe set about, a violent friend, but a much more violent enemy. ...\r\n[When Lauderdale] was prisoner after Worcester fight, she made him\r\nbelieve he was in great danger of his life, and that she saved it by her\r\nintrigues with Cromwell.--_Swift._ Cromwell had gallantries with her.\r\n\r\nP. 248. _Burnet._ The clergy ... saw designs were forming to turn them\r\nall out: And, hearing that they might be better provided in Ireland,\r\nthey were in many places bought out, and prevailed on to desert their\r\ncures.--_Swift._ So Ireland was well provided.\r\n\r\nP. 252. _Burnet._ The King ... suspecting that Lord Cornbury was in the\r\ndesign, spoke to him as one in a rage that forgot all decency. ... In\r\nthe afternoon he heard him with more temper, as he himself told\r\nme.--_Swift._ Who told him?\r\n\r\nP. 253. _Burnet,_ speaking of Sheldon's remonstrating with the King\r\nabout his mistresses, adds:--From that day forward Sheldon could never\r\nrecover the King's confidence.--_Swift._ Sheldon had refused the\r\nsacrament to the King for living in adultery.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ Sir Orlando Bridgman ... was a man of great integrity,\r\nand had very serious impressions of religion on his mind. He had been\r\nalways on the side of the Church.--_Swift._ What side should he be of?\r\n\r\nP. 256. _Burnet,_ speaking of the Earl of Clarendon's banishment:--It\r\nseemed against the common course of justice, to make all\r\ncorresponding with him treason, when he himself was not attainted of\r\ntreason.--_Swift._ Bishop of Rochester's case.\r\n\r\nP. 257. _Burnet._ Thus the Lord Clarendon fell under the common fate of\r\ngreat ministers, whose employment exposes them to envy, and draws upon\r\nthem the indignation of all who are disappointed in their pretensions.\r\nTheir friends turning as violently against them, as they formerly fawned\r\nabjectly upon them.--_Swift._ Stupid moralist.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet,_ speaking of the Earl of Clarendon's eldest son, who\r\nafterwards succeeded him, says:--His judgement was not to be _much_\r\ndepended on, for he was _much_ carried by vulgar prejudices, and false\r\nnotions. He was _much_ in the Queen's favour. _Swift._ Much, much, much.\r\n\r\nP. 258. _Burnet,_ speaking of the Earl of Rochester, second son of Lord\r\nClarendon:--[He] is a man of far greater parts [than his brother]. He\r\nhas a _very good pen_, but speaks not gracefully.--_Swift._ I suppose it\r\nwas of gold or silver.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ [The King] told me, he had a chaplain, that was a very\r\nhonest man, but a very great blockhead, to whom he had given a living in\r\nSuffolk, that was full of that sort of people [Nonconformists]. He had\r\ngone about among them from house to house, though he could not imagine\r\nwhat he could say to them, for he said he was a very silly fellow. But\r\nthat, he believed, his nonsense suited their nonsense, for he had\r\nbrought them all to church. And, in reward of his diligence, he had\r\ngiven him a bishopric in Ireland.--_Swift._ Bishop Wolley, of Clonfert.\r\n\r\nP. 259. _Burnet._ If the sectaries were humble and modest, and would\r\ntell what would satisfy them, there might be some colour for granting\r\nsome concessions.--_Swift._ I think so too.\r\n\r\nP. 260. _Burnet._ The three volumes of the \"Friendly Debate,\" though\r\nwrit by a very good man.--_Swift._ Writ by Bishop Patrick.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ After he [Samuel Parker, afterwards Bishop of Oxford]\r\nhad for some years entertained the nation with several virulent books,\r\nwrit with much life, he was attacked by the liveliest droll of the age,\r\netc.--_Swift._ What is a droll? _Burnet._ That not only humbled Parker,\r\nbut the whole party. For the author of \"The Rehearsal Transposed,\"\r\netc.--_Swift._ Andrew Marvel.\r\n\r\nP. 263. _Burnet,_ speaking of the King's attachment to Nell Gwyn,\r\nsays:--But after all he never treated her with the _decencies_ of a\r\nmistress.--_Swift._ Pray what _decencies_ are those?\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ The King had another mistress, that was managed by Lord\r\nShaftesbury, who was the daughter of a clergyman, Roberts, in whom her\r\nfirst education had so deep a root, that, though she fell into many\r\nscandalous disorders, with very dismal adventures in them all, yet a\r\nprinciple of religion was so deep laid in her, that, though it did not\r\nrestrain her, yet it kept alive in her such a constant horror at sin,\r\nthat she was never easy in an ill course, and died with a great sense of\r\nher former ill life. I was _often with her_ the last three months of her\r\nlife.--_Swift_. Was she handsome then?\r\n\r\nP. 264. _Burnet_. The King loved his [the Earl of Rochester's] company\r\nfor the diversion it afforded, better than his person: And there was no\r\nlove lost between them.--_Swift_. A noble phrase.\r\n\r\nP. 265. _Burnet_. Sedley had a more sudden and copious wit, which\r\nfurnished a perpetual run of discourse: But he was not so correct as\r\nLord Dorset, nor so sparkling as Lord Rochester.--_Swift_. No better a\r\ncritic in wit than style.\r\n\r\nP. 266. _Burnet_. Lord Roberts, afterwards made Earl of Radnor, [who\r\nsucceeded the Duke of Ormonde in his government of Ireland,] was a\r\nmorose man, believed to be severely just, and as wise as a _cynical_\r\nhumour could allow him to be.--_Swift_. How does that hinder wisdom?\r\n\r\nP. 273. _Burnet_. Charles II. confessed himself a Papist to the Prince\r\nof Orange:--The Prince told me, that he never spoke of this to any other\r\nperson, till _after his death_.--_Swift_. That is, _his own death_.\r\n\r\nP. 277. _Burnet_ quotes an exclamation of Archbishop Sharp's, after an\r\nattempt to assassinate him, and adds:--This was the single expression\r\nsavouring of piety, that ever fell from him in all the conversation that\r\npassed between him and me.--_Swift._ Rank malice.\r\n\r\nP. 285. _Burnet_. No body could ever tell me how the word\r\n\"Ecclesiastical matters\" was put in the Act. Leightoun thought, he was\r\nsure it was put in after the draught and form of the Act was agreed\r\non.--_Swift_. Nonsense.\r\n\r\nP. 287. _Burnet_, speaking of Archbishop Burnet, says:--He was not cut\r\nout for a court, or for the ministry.--_Swift_. A phrase of dignity.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burne_, mentioning his own appointment as Professor of Divinity\r\nat Glasgow University, says:--There was no sort of artifice or\r\nmanagement to bring this about: It came of themselves: And they did it\r\nwithout any recommendation of any person whatsoever.--_Swift_. Modest.\r\n\r\nP. 288. _Burnet_. The Episcopal party thought I intended to make myself\r\npopular at their cost: So they began that strain of fury and calumny\r\nthat has pursued me ever since from _that sort of people_.--_Swift_. A\r\ncivil term for all who are Episcopal.\r\n\r\nP. 298. _Burnet_. [In compiling the Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton,] I\r\nfound there materials for a very large history. I writ it with great\r\nsincerity; and concealed none of their errors. I did indeed conceal\r\nseveral things that related to the King: I left out some passages that\r\nwere in his letters; in some of which was too much weakness.--_Swift._\r\nThe letters, if they had been published, could not have given a worse\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nP. 300. _Burnet,_ speaking of the Scotch clergy refusing to be made\r\nbishops, says:--They had an ill opinion of the court, and could not be\r\nbrought to leave their retirement.--_Swift._ For that very reason they\r\nshould have accepted bishoprics.\r\n\r\nP. 301. _Burnet,_ after mentioning the murder of the Duchess of Orleans,\r\nsays:--I will set down one story of her, that was told me by a person of\r\ndistinction, who had it from some who were well informed of the\r\nmatter.--_Swift._ Poor authority.\r\n\r\nP. 303. _Burnet._ Madame [the Duchess of Orleans] had an intrigue with\r\nanother person, whom I knew well, the Count of Tréville. When she was in\r\nher agony, she said, \"Adieu, Tréville.\" He was so struck with this\r\naccident, that it had a good effect on him; for he went and lived many\r\nyears among the Fathers of the Oratory, and became both a very learned,\r\nand devout man. He came afterwards out into the world. I saw him often.\r\nHe was a man of a very sweet temper, only a little too formal for a\r\nFrenchman. But he was very sincere. He was a Jansenist. He hated the\r\nJesuits.--_Swift._ Pretty jumping periods.\r\n\r\nP. 304. _Burnet._ Lord Shaftesbury laid the blame of this chiefly on the\r\nDuke of Buckingham: For he told me, ... And therefore he blamed\r\nhim.--_Swift._ Who blamed whom.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ The Duke of Savoy was encouraged to make a conquest of\r\nGenoa.--_Swift._ Geneva.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ When a foreign minister asked the King's leave to treat\r\nwith him [Lockhart] in his master's name, the King consented; but with\r\nthis severe reflection, That he believed he would be true to anybody but\r\nhimself.--_Swift._ Does he mean, Lockhart would not be true to Lockhart?\r\n\r\nP. 305. _Burnet._ They [the French] so possessed De Groot, then the\r\nDutch ambassador at Paris, or they corrupted him into a belief that they\r\nhad no design on them, etc.--_Swift._ Who on whom?\r\n\r\nP. 306. _Burnet._ The Earl of Shaftesbury was the chief man in this\r\nadvice [recommending the King to shut up the exchequer].--_Swift._\r\nClifford had the merit of this.\r\n\r\nP. 318. _Burnet,_ after mentioning the death of William II., Prince of\r\nOrange, says of the Princess:--As she bore her son a week after his\r\ndeath, in the eighth month of her time, so he came into the world under\r\ngreat disadvantages.--_Swift._ A pretty contrast.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet_ mentions an astrological prediction of the Prince's fate,\r\nand adds:--But that which _was_ most particular _was_, that he _was_ to\r\nhave a son by a widow, and _was_ to die of the small-pox in the\r\ntwenty-fifth year of his age.--_Swift_. Was, was, was, was.\r\n\r\nP. 320. _Burnet_. They set it also up for a maxim.--_Swift_. He can vary\r\na phrase; set up for a maxim, and lay down for a maxim.\r\n\r\nP. 321. _Burnet_. His oath was made to them, and by consequence it was\r\nin their power to release the obligation that did arise from it to\r\nthemselves.--_Swift_. Bad casuist.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. As soon as he [the Prince of Orange] was brought into\r\nthe command of the armies, he told me, he spoke to De Witt, and desired\r\nto live in an entire confidence with him. His answer was cold: So he saw\r\nthat he could not depend upon him. When he told me this, he added, that\r\nhe was certainly one of the greatest men of the age, and he believed he\r\nserved his country faithfully--_Swift_. Yet the Prince contrived that he\r\nshould be murdered.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. Now I come to give an account of the fifth crisis\r\nbrought on the whole reformation, which has been of the longest\r\ncontinuance, since we are yet in the agitations of it.--_Swift_. Under\r\nthe Queen and Lord Oxford's ministry.\r\n\r\nP. 322. _Burnet_. [In this famous campaign of Louis XIV. against the\r\nDutch, (1672,)] there was so little heart or judgement shewn in the\r\nmanagement of that run of success, etc.--_Swift_. A metaphor, but from\r\ngamesters.\r\n\r\nP. 326. _Burnet_, referring to the action of the rabble when Cornelius\r\nde Witt was banished, says of the Prince of Orange:--His enemies have\r\ntaken advantages from thence to cast the infamy of this on him, and on\r\nhis party, to make them all odious; though the Prince spoke of it always\r\nto me with the greatest horror possible.--_Swift_. Yet he was guilty\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nP. 328. _Burnet_. Prince Waldeck was their chief general: A man of a\r\ngreat compass.--_Swift, i.e._ very fat.\r\n\r\nP. 330. _Burnet_. He broke twice with the Prince, after he came into a\r\nconfidence with him. He employed me to reconcile him to him for the\r\nthird time--_Swift_. Perspicuity.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ The actions sinking on the sudden on the breaking out of\r\na new war, that sunk him into a melancholy, which quite distracted\r\nhim.--_Swift_. Eloquent.\r\n\r\nP. 335. _Burnet_. I will complete the transactions of this memorable\r\nyear:--P. 337. Thus I have gone far into the state of affairs of Holland\r\nin this memorable year.--_Swift_. Why, you called it so but just now\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nP. 337. _Burnet_. It seems, the French made no great account of their\r\nprisoners, for they released 25,000 Dutch for 50,000 crowns--_Swift_.\r\nWhat! ten shillings a piece! By much too dear for a Dutchman.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. This year [1672] the King declared a new mistress, and\r\nmade her Duchess of Portsmouth. She had been maid of honour to Madame,\r\nthe King's sister, and had come over with her to Dover; where the King\r\nhad expressed such a regard to her, that the Duke of Buckingham, who\r\nhated the Duchess of Cleveland, intended to _put her on the\r\nKing_.--_Swift._ Surely he means the contrary.\r\n\r\nP. 341. _Burnet_. [The Duke of Lauderdale] called for me all on the\r\nsudden, and put me in mind of the project I had laid before him, of\r\nputting all the outed ministers by _couples_ into parishes: So that\r\ninstead of wandering about the country to hold conventicles in all\r\nplaces, they might be fixed to a certain abode, and every one might have\r\nthe half of a benefice.--_Swift._ A sottish project; instead of feeding\r\n_fifty_, you starve a _hundred_.\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nP. 346. _Burnet_. It was believed, if the design had succeeded, he [Lord\r\nClifford] had agreed with his wife to take orders, and to aspire to a\r\ncardinal's hat.--_Swift_. Was he or she to take orders?\r\n\r\nP. 362. _Burnet_. I told him, what afterwards happened, that most of\r\nthese would make their own terms, and leave him in the lurch.--_Swift_.\r\nTrue sublime.\r\n\r\nP. 370. _Burnet_. I was ever of Nazianzen's opinion, who never wished to\r\nsee any more synods of the clergy.--_Swift_. Dog!\r\n\r\nP. 372. _Burnet_, when he was struck out of the list of chaplains,\r\nsays:--The King said, he was afraid I had been too busy; and wished me\r\nto go home to Scotland, and be more quiet.--_Swift_. The King knew him\r\nright.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. I preached in many of the churches of London; and was so\r\nwell received, that it was probable I might be accepted of in any that\r\nwas to be disposed of by _a popular election._--_Swift_. Much to his\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nP. 373. _Burnet_. This violent and groundless prosecution lasted some\r\nmonths. And during that time I said to some, that Duke Lauderdale had\r\ngone so far in opening some wicked designs to me, that I perceived he\r\ncould not be satisfied, unless I was undone. So I told what was\r\nmentioned before of the discourses that passed between him and\r\nme.--_Swift_. Scotch dog!\r\n\r\nP. 374. _Burnet_. He [Lord Howard] went over in the beginning of the\r\nwar, and offered to serve De Witt. But he told me, he found him a dry\r\nman.--_Swift_. Who told who? I guess Howard told Burnet.\r\n\r\nP. 378. _Burnet_. At least he [Sir William Temple] thought religion was\r\nfit only for the mob.--_Swift_. A word of dignity for an historian.\r\n_Burnet._ He was a corrupter of all that came near him. And he delivered\r\nhimself up wholly to study, ease, and pleasure.--_Swift_. Sir William\r\nTemple was a man of virtue, to which Burnet was a stranger.\r\n\r\nP. 380. _Burnet_, speaking of his being pressed, before Parliament, to\r\nreveal what passed between him and the Duke of Lauderdale _in private_;\r\nand the Parliament, in case of refusal, threatening him, says:--Upon\r\nthis I yielded, and gave an account of the discourse formerly\r\nmentioned.--_Swift_. Treacherous villain.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. My love to my country, and my private friendships\r\ncarried me perhaps too far.--_Swift_. Right.\r\n\r\nP. 382. _Burnet_. [Sir Harbottle Grimstone] had always _a tenderness to\r\nthe Dissenters_.--_Swift_. Burnet's test of all virtues.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. [Lady Grimstone] was the humblest, the devoutest, and\r\nbest tempered person I ever _knew of that sort_ [having high notions for\r\nChurch and Crown].--_Swift_. Rogue.\r\n\r\nP. 384. _Burnet_, the country party maintained that:--if a Parliament\r\nthought any law inconvenient for the good of the whole, they must be\r\nsupposed still free to alter it: And no previous limitation could bind\r\nup their legislature.--_Swift._ Wrong arguing.\r\n\r\nP. 387. _Burnet_. It was said, a standing Parliament changed the\r\nconstitution of England.--_Swift_. The present case under King George.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. It was moved, that an address should be made to the King\r\nfor dissolving the Parliament.--_Swift. Tempora mutantur_; for nothing\r\nnow will do but septennial Parliaments.\r\n\r\nP. 388 _Burnet_. He [Lord Russell] had from his first education an\r\ninclination to favour the Non-conformists.--_Swift_. So have all the\r\nauthor's favourites.\r\n\r\nP. 392. _Burnet_. But with these good qualities Compton was a weak man,\r\nwilful, and strangely wedded to a party.--_Swift._ He means, to the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. Bancroft, Dean of St. Paul's, was raised to [the see of\r\nCanterbury]. ... He was a man of solemn deportment, had a sullen gravity\r\nin his looks, and was considerably learned. He had put on a monastic\r\nstrictness, and lived abstracted from company. ... He was a dry, cold\r\nman, reserved, and peevish; so that none loved him, and few esteemed\r\nhim.--_Swift_. False and detracting.\r\n\r\nP. 396. _Burnet_. My way of writing history pleased him [Sir William\r\nJones].--_Swift_. Very modest.\r\n\r\nP. 399. _Burnet_. Men were now though silent, not quiet.--_Swift_.\r\nNonsense, or printer's mistake. It should be, \"Silent, though not\r\nquiet.\"\r\n\r\n_Ibid, Burnet_. One Carstairs, a loose and vicious gentleman.--_Swift_.\r\nEpithets well placed.\r\n\r\nP. 404. _Burnet_. It was an extraordinary thing that a random cannon\r\nshot should have killed him [Turenne].--_Swift_. How extraordinary?\r\nMight it not kill him as well as another man?\r\n\r\nP. 406. _Burnet_, in the battle at St. Omer between the Prince of Orange\r\n(afterwards King William) and the Duke of Orleans:--some regiments of\r\nmarines, on whom the Prince depended much, did basely run away. Yet the\r\nother bodies fought so well, that he lost not much, besides the _honour\r\nof the day_.--_Swift_. He was used to that.\r\n\r\nP. 407. _Burnet_. These leading men did so entangle the debates, and\r\nover-reached those on whom he had practised, that they, working on the\r\naversion that the English nation naturally has to a French interest,\r\nspoiled the hopefullest session the court had had of a great while,\r\nbefore the court was well aware of it.--_Swift_. Rare style!\r\n\r\nP. 409. _Burnet_, Lord Danby, speaking to King Charles II., said:--If\r\nthey saw his [the Duke of York's] daughter given to one that was at the\r\nhead of the Protestant interest, it would very much soften those\r\napprehensions, when it did appear that his religion was only a personal\r\nthing, not to be derived to his children after him. With all this the\r\nKing was convinced.--_Swift_. Then how was the King for bringing in\r\nPopery?\r\n\r\nP. 413. _Burnet_. His friend answered, He hoped he did not intend to\r\nmake use of him to trepan a man to his ruin. Upon that, with lifted up\r\nhands, Sharp promised by the living God, that no hurt should come to\r\nhim, if he made a full discovery.--_Swift_. Malice.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet_, upon the examination of Mitchell before the\r\nprivy-council for the intended assassination of Archbishop Sharp, it\r\nbeing first proposed to cut off the prisoner's right hand, and then his\r\nleft:--Lord Rothes, who was a pleasant man, said, \"How shall he wipe his\r\nbreech then?\" This is not very _decent_ to be mentioned in such a work,\r\nif it were not necessary.--_Swift_. As decent as a thousand other\r\npassages; so he might have spared his apology.\r\n\r\nP. 414. _Burnet_, in the last article of the above trial, observes:--\r\nBut the judge, who hated Sharp, as he went up to the bench, passing by\r\nthe prisoner said to him, \"Confess nothing, unless you are sure of your\r\nlimbs as well as of your life.\"--_Swift_. A rare judge.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet_, mentioning Mackenzie's appointment as king's advocate,\r\nsays of him:--He has published many books, some of law, but all full of\r\nfaults; for he was a slight and superficial man.--_Swift_. Envious and\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nP. 416. _Burnet_, speaking of the execution of the above Mitchell for\r\nthe attempt against Sharp, says:--Yet Duke Lauderdale had a chaplain,\r\nHickes, afterwards Dean of Worcester, who published a false and partial\r\nrelation of this matter, in order to the justifying of it--_Swift_. A\r\nlearned, pious man.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The \"Ravillac [_sic_] Redivivus\" of Hickes, is,\r\nnotwithstanding his learning and piety, in every respect deserving of\r\nthe censures passed upon it by Burnet. [S.]]\r\n\r\nP. 425. _Burnet_. [Titus Oates] got to be a chaplain in one of the\r\nking's ships, from which he was dismissed upon complaint of some\r\nunnatural practices, not to be named.--_Swift_. Only sodomy.\r\n\r\nP. 434. _Burnet_. He [Staley] was cast.--_Swift. Anglicê_, found guilty.\r\n\r\nP. 441. _Burnet_, on the impeachment of Lord Danby:--Maynard, an ancient\r\nand eminent lawyer, explained the words of the statute of 25 Edward III.\r\nthat the courts of law could not proceed but upon one of the crimes\r\nthere enumerated: But the Parliament had still a power, by the clause in\r\nthat Act, to declare what they thought was treason.--_Swift_. Yes, by a\r\nnew Act, but not with a retrospect; therefore Maynard was a _knave or a\r\nfool, with all his law_.\r\n\r\nP. 442. _Burnet_. This indeed would have justified the King, if it had\r\nbeen demanded above board.--_Swift_. Style of a gamester.\r\n\r\nP. 451. _Burnet_. Yet many thought, that, what doctrines soever men\r\nmight by a subtlety of speculation be earned into, the approaches of\r\ndeath, with the seriousness that appeared in their deportment, must\r\nneeds work so much on the probity and candour which seemed footed in\r\nhuman nature, etc.--_Swift._ Credat Judaeus Apella.\r\n\r\nP. 455. _Burnet_, the Bill of Exclusion disinherited:--the next heir,\r\nwhich certainly the King and Parliament might do, as well as any private\r\nman might disinherit his next heir.--_Swift._ That is not always true.\r\nYet it was certainly in the power of King and Parliament to exclude the\r\nnext heir.\r\n\r\nP. 457. _Burnet_. Government was appointed for those that were to be\r\ngoverned, and not for the sake of governors themselves.--_Swift_. A\r\ntrue maxim and infallible.\r\n\r\nP. 458. _Burnet_. It was a maxim among our lawyers, that even an Act of\r\nParliament against _Magna Charta_ was null of itself.--_Swift_. A\r\nsottish maxim.\r\n\r\nP. 459. _Burnet_. For a great while I thought the accepting the\r\nlimitations [proposed in the Exclusion Bill] was the wisest and best\r\nmethod.--_Swift_. It was the wisest, because it would be less opposed;\r\nand the King would consent to it; otherwise an _exclusion_ would have\r\ndone better.\r\n\r\nP. 471. _Burnet_. The guards having lost thirty of their number were\r\nforced to run for it.--_Swift_. For what?\r\n\r\nP. 475. _Burnet_. Dangerfield, a subtle and dexterous man, who ... was a\r\nfalse coiner, undertook now to coin a plot for the ends of the\r\nPapists.--_Swift_. Witty.\r\n\r\nP. 479. _Burnet_. Godolphin ... had true principles of religion and\r\nvirtue, and was free from all vanity, and never heaped up wealth: So\r\nthat all things being laid together, he was one of the worthiest and\r\nwisest men that has been employed in our time.--_Swift_. All this very\r\npartial to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nP. 483. _Burnet_. I laid open the cruelties of the Church of Rome in\r\nmany instances that happened in Queen Mary's reign, which were not then\r\nknown: And I _aggravated_, though _very truly_, the danger of falling\r\nunder the power of that religion.--_Swift_. A BULL!\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. Sprat had studied a polite style much: But there was\r\nlittle strength in it: He had the beginnings of learning laid well in\r\nhim: But he has allowed himself in a course of some years in much sloth\r\nand too many liberties.--_Swift_. Very false.\r\n\r\nP. 489. _Burnet_. Here was a justice to be done, and a service to truth,\r\ntowards the saving a man's life.... He advised with all his friends, and\r\nwith my self in particular. The much greater number were of opinion that\r\nhe ought to be silent.--_Swift_. Damned advice.\r\n\r\nP. 496. _Burnet_. Jones stood upon a point of law, of the\r\nunseparableness of the prerogative from the person of the\r\nKing.--_Swift_. A lawyer's way of arguing, very weak.\r\n\r\nP. 509. _Burnet_, speaking of the grand juries in the latter end of King\r\nCharles's reign returning _ignoramus_ so frequently on bills of\r\nindictment, states that:--in defence of these _ignoramus juries_ it was\r\nsaid, that by the express words of their oath they were bound to make\r\ntrue presentments of what should appear true to them: And therefore, if\r\nthey did not believe the evidence, they could not find a bill, though\r\nsworn to. A book was writ to support that, in which both law and reason\r\nwere brought to confirm it: It passed as writ by Lord Essex, though I\r\nunderstood afterwards it was writ by Somers.--_Swift_. Lord Somers.\r\n\r\nP. 516. _Burnet_ says, on the imposition of a Test Act:--The bishops\r\nwere earnest for this, which they thought would secure them for ever\r\nfrom a Presbyterian Parliament. It was carried in the vote: And that\r\nmade many of the court more zealous than ever for carrying through the\r\nAct.--_Swift_. And it was very reasonable.\r\n\r\nP. 519. _Burnet_ mentions that, when the Test Act was passed:--about\r\neighty of the most learned and pious of their clergy left all rather\r\nthan comply with the terms of this law.... About twenty of them came up\r\nto England.--_Swift_. Enough to corrupt England.\r\n\r\nP. 523. _Burnet_, describing the death of the Duke of Lauderdale,\r\nsays--His heart seemed quite spent: There was not left above the bigness\r\nof a walnut of firm substance: The rest was spongy, liker the lungs than\r\nthe heart.--_Swift. Anglicé_, more like.\r\n\r\nP. 525. _Burnet_, Home was convicted on the credit of one infamous\r\nevidence:--Applications were made to the Duke [of York] for saving his\r\nlife: But he was not born under _a pardoning planet_.--_Swift_. Silly\r\nfop.\r\n\r\nP. 526. _Burnet_ All the Presbyterian party saw they were now\r\ndisinherited of a main part of their birth-right.--_Swift_. As much of\r\nPapists as of Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nP. 527. _Burnet_, speaking of the surrender of the charters in 1682:--It\r\nwas said, that those who were in the government in corporations, and had\r\ntheir charters and seals trusted to their keeping, were not the\r\nproprietors nor masters of those rights. They could not extinguish those\r\ncorporations, nor part with any of their privileges. Others said, that\r\nwhatever might be objected to the reason and equity of the thing, yet,\r\nwhen the seal of a corporation was put to any deed, such a deed was good\r\nin law. The matter goes beyond my skill in law to determine\r\nit.--_Swift_. What does he think of the surrenders of the charters of\r\nabbeys?\r\n\r\nP. 528. _Burnet_ The Non-conformists were now persecuted with much\r\neagerness. This was visibly set on by the Papists: And it was wisely\r\ndone of them, for they knew how much the _Non-conformists were set\r\nagainst them_.--_Swift_. Not so much as they are against the Church.\r\n\r\nP. 531. _Burnet_ Lord Hyde was the person that disposed the Duke to it:\r\nUpon that Lord Halifax and he fell to be in ill terms; for he hated Lord\r\nSunderland beyond expression, though he had married his\r\nsister.--_Swift_. Who married whose sister?\r\n\r\nP. 536. _Burnet_ The truth is, juries became at that time the shame of\r\nthe nation, as well as a reproach to religion: For they were packed, and\r\nprepared to bring in verdicts as they were directed and not as matters\r\nappeared on the evidence.--_Swift_. So they are now.\r\n\r\nP. 538. _Burnet_ He [Algernon Sidney] was ambassador in Denmark at the\r\ntime of the Restoration.--_Swift_. For Cromwell.\r\n\r\nP. 543. _Burnet_, on Rumbold's proposal to shoot the King at Hodsdon, in\r\nhis way to Newmarket, adds:--They [the conspirators] ran into much\r\n_wicked talk_ about the way of executing that. But nothing was ever\r\nfixed on: All was _but talk_.--_Swift_. All plots begin with talk.\r\n\r\nP. 548. _Burnet_. At the time of Lord Russell's plot, Baillie being\r\nasked by the King whether they had any design against his person? he\r\nfrankly said not; but being asked:--if they had been in any\r\nconsultations with lords or others in England, in order to an\r\ninsurrection in Scotland? Baillie faltered at this. For his _conscience_\r\nrestrained him from _lying_;--_Swift._ The author and his _cousins_\r\ncould _not tell lies_, but they _could plot_.\r\n\r\nP. 549. _Burnet._ Next morning he went with him to the Tower gate, the\r\nmessenger being again fast asleep.--_Swift._ Is this a blunder?\r\n\r\nP. 553. _Burnet,_ speaking of Lord Essex's suicide (1683)--His man,\r\nthinking he stayed longer than ordinary in his _closet_, looked through\r\nthe key hole, and there saw him lying dead.--_Swift._ He was on the\r\nclose stool.\r\n\r\nP. 555. _Burnet,_ on Lord Russell's trial--Finch summed up the evidence\r\nagainst him. But ... shewed more of a vicious eloquence, in turning\r\nmatters with some subtlety against the prisoners, than of solid or\r\nsincere reasoning.--_Swift._ Afterwards Earl of Aylesford, an arrant\r\nrascal.\r\n\r\nP. 562. _Burnet._ I offered to take my oath, that the speech [of Lord\r\nRussell] was penned by himself, and not by me.--_Swift._ Jesuitical.\r\n\r\nP. 567. _Burnet._ I knew Spanheim particularly, _who was_ envoy from the\r\nElector of Brandenburg, _who is_ the greatest critic of the age in all\r\nancient learning.--_Swift. Who was--who is_, pure nonsense.\r\n\r\nP. 568. _Burnet._ All people were apprehensive of very black designs,\r\nwhen they saw Jeffreys made Lord Chief Justice, who ... run out upon all\r\noccasions into declamations, that did not become the bar, much less the\r\nbench. He was not learned in his profession: And his eloquence, though\r\nviciously copious, yet was neither correct nor agreeable.--_Swift._ Like\r\nBurnet's eloquence.\r\n\r\nP. 572. _Burnet,_ on Algernon Sidney's trial, observes, that:--Finch\r\naggravated the matter of the book, as a proof of his intentions,\r\npretending it was an overt act, for he said, _Scribere est\r\nagere_.--_Swift._ Yet this Finch was made Earl of Aylesford by King\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet,_ when Sidney charged the sheriffs who brought him the\r\nexecution-warrant with having packed the jury--one of the sheriffs ...\r\nwept. He told it to a person, from whom Tillotson had it, who told it\r\nme.--_Swift._ Admirable authority.\r\n\r\nP. 577. _Burnet._ So that it was plain, that after all the story they\r\nhad made of the [Rye-house] Plot, it had gone no further, than that a\r\ncompany of seditious and inconsiderable persons were framing among\r\nthemselves some treasonable schemes, that were never likely to come to\r\nanything.--_Swift._ Cursed partiality.\r\n\r\nP. 579. _Burnet_. The King [Charles II.] had published a story all about\r\nthe court, ... as the reason of this extreme severity against Armstrong:\r\nHe said, that he was sent over by Cromwell to murder him beyond sea; ...\r\nand that upon his confessing it he had promised him never to speak of it\r\nany more as long as he lived. So the King, counting him now dead in law,\r\nthought he was free from that promise.--_Swift_. If the King had a mind\r\nto lie, he would have stayed till Armstrong was hanged.\r\n\r\nP. 583. _Burnet_. It ended in dismissing Lord Aberdeen, and making Lord\r\nPerth chancellor, to which he had been long aspiring in a most indecent\r\nmanner.--_Swift. Decent_ and _indecent_, very useful words to this\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nP. 585. _Burnet_. I saved myself out of those difficulties by saying to\r\nall my friends, that I would not be involved in any such confidence; for\r\nas long as I thought our circumstances were such that resistance was not\r\nlawful, I thought the concealing any design in order to it was likewise\r\nunlawful.--_Swift._ Jesuitical.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_ says, after relating how the thumb-screws were applied to\r\nSpence and Carstairs:--Upon what was thus screwed out of these two\r\npersons, etc.--_Swift_. Witty the second time.\r\n\r\nP. 586. _Burnet_, Baillie suffered several hardships and fines for being\r\nsupposed to be in the Rye-house Plot; yet:--seemed all the while so\r\ncomposed, and even so cheerful, that his behaviour looked like the\r\nreviving of the spirit of the noblest of the old Greeks or\r\nRomans.--_Swift_. For he was our _cousin_.\r\n\r\nP. 587. _Burnet_, speaking of Baillie's execution, says:--The only\r\nexcuse that was ever pretended for this infamous prosecution was, that\r\nthey were sure he was guilty.--_Swift_. Bishop of Rochester.\r\n\r\nP. 588. _Burnet_, Lord Perth wanting to see Leightoun, I writ so\r\nearnestly to him, that he came to London; and, on--his coming to me, I\r\nwas amazed to see him at above seventy look so fresh and well.... [Two\r\ndays afterwards] Leightoun sunk so, that both speech and sense went away\r\nof a sudden: And he continued panting about twelve hours; and then died\r\nwithout pangs or convulsions.--_Swift_. Burnet killed him by bringing\r\nhim to London.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_ Leightoun ... retained still a peculiar inclination to\r\nScotland.--_Swift_. Yet he chose to live in England.\r\n\r\nP. 589. _Burnet_, speaking of Leightoun's views of the Church of\r\nEngland, says:--As to the administration, both with relation to the\r\necclesiastical courts, and the pastoral care, he looked on it as one of\r\nthe most corrupt he had ever seen.--_Swift_. Very civil.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. There were two remarkable circumstances in his\r\n[Leightoun's] death. He used often to say, that if he were to choose a\r\nplace to die in, it should be an inn; it looking like a pilgrim's going\r\nhome, to whom this world was all as an inn, and who was weary of the\r\nnoise and confusion in it.--_Swift._ Canting puppy.\r\n\r\nP. 590. _Burnet_. Sterne, Archbishop of York, died in the 86th year of\r\nhis age: He was a sour ill-tempered man, and minded chiefly the\r\nenriching his family.--_Swift_. Yet thought author of \"The Whole Duty of\r\nMan.\"\r\n\r\nP. 591. _Burnet_ says of Bishop Mew:--Though he knew very little of\r\ndivinity, or of any other learning, and was weak to a childish degree,\r\nyet obsequiousness and zeal raised him through several steps to this\r\ngreat see [Bath and Wells].--_Swift_. This character is true.\r\n\r\nP. 595. _Burnet_. And now the tables were turned--_Swift._ Style of a\r\ngamester.\r\n\r\nP. 596. _Burnet_, being appointed to preach the sermon on the Gunpowder\r\nPlot, (1684,) at the Rolls Chapel:--I chose for my text these words:\r\n\"Save me from the lion's mouth, thou hast heard me from the horns of the\r\nunicorns.\" I made no reflection in my thoughts on the lion and unicorn,\r\nas being the two supporters of the King's scutcheon.--_Swift_. I doubt\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nP. 600. _Burnet_ relates a story of a quarrel between three gentlemen,\r\none of whom was killed. He says that one of the others:--was prevailed\r\non to confess the indictment, and to let sentence pass on him for\r\nmurder; a pardon being promised him if he should do so. [After this he\r\nhad to pay £16,000 for his pardon.]--_Swift_. The story is wrong told.\r\n\r\nP. 604. _Burnet_ mentions a scheme to raise dissensions between Charles\r\nII. and the Duke of York, and adds:--Mr. May of the privy purse told me,\r\nthat he was told there was a design to break out, with which he himself\r\nwould be well pleased.--_Swift_. The bishop told me this with many more\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nP. 609. _Burnet_, speaking of the suspicion of Charles II. being\r\npoisoned, says that:--Lower and Needham, two famous physicians, ...\r\n[noticed some] blue spots on the outside of the stomach. Needham called\r\ntwice to have it opened: but the surgeons seemed not to hear him. And\r\nwhen he moved it the second time, he, as he told me, heard Lower say to\r\none that stood next him, \"Needham will undo us, calling thus to have the\r\nstomach opened, for he may see they will not do it.\" ... Le Fevre, a\r\nFrench physician, told me, he saw a blackness in the shoulder; Upon\r\nwhich he made an incision, and saw it was all mortified. Short, another\r\nphysician, who was a Papist, but after a form of his own, did very much\r\nsuspect foul dealing.--_Swift_. One physician told me this from Short\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nP. 611. _Burnet_, describing the behaviour of Charles II. when in hiding\r\nafter the battle of Worcester, says:--Under all the apprehensions he had\r\nthen upon him, he shewed a temper so careless, and so much turned to\r\nlevity, that he was then diverting himself with little household sports,\r\nin as unconcerned a manner, as if he had made no loss, and had been in\r\nno danger at all.--_Swift._ This might admit a more favourable turn.\r\n\r\nP. 613. _Burnet,_ in his character of Charles II., says:--His person and\r\ntemper, his vices as well as his fortunes, resemble the character that\r\nwe have given us of Tiberius so much, that it were easy to draw the\r\nparallel between them. Tiberius's banishment, and his coming afterwards\r\nto reign, makes the comparison in that respect come pretty near. His\r\nhating of business, and his love of pleasures, his raising of\r\nfavourites, and trusting them entirely; and his pulling them down, and\r\nhating them excessively; his art of covering deep designs, particularly\r\nof revenge, with an appearance of softness, brings them so near a\r\nlikeness, that I did not wonder much to observe the resemblance of their\r\nface and person.--_Swift._ Malicious, and in many circumstances false.\r\n\r\nP. 615. _Burnet_ concludes his character of Charles II. with these\r\nwords:--How ungrateful soever this labour has proved to my self, and how\r\nunacceptable soever it may be to some, who are either obliged to\r\nremember him gratefully, or by the engagement of parties and interests\r\nare under other biasses, yet I have gone through all that I knew\r\nrelating to his life and reign with that regard to truth, and what I\r\nthink may be instructive to mankind, which became an impartial writer of\r\nhistory, and one who believes, that he must give an account to God of\r\nwhat he writes, as well as of what he says and does.--_Swift._ He was\r\ncertainly a very bad prince, but not to the degree described in this\r\ncharacter, which is poorly drawn, and mingled with malice very unworthy\r\nan historian, and the style abominable, as in the whole history, and the\r\nobservations trite and vulgar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nP. 623. _Burnet._ Because Chudleigh the envoy there had openly broken\r\nwith the Prince [of Orange], (for he not only waited no more on him, but\r\nacted openly against him; and once in the Vorhaut had affronted him,\r\nwhile he was driving the Princess upon the snow in a _trainau_,\r\naccording to the German manner, and pretending they were masked, and\r\nthat he did not know them, had ordered his coachman to keep his way, as\r\nthey were coming towards the place where he drove;) the King recalled\r\nhim.--_Swift._ A pretty parenthesis.\r\n\r\nP. 626. _Burnet._ This gave all thinking men a melancholy prospect.\r\nEngland now seemed lost, unless some happy accident should save it. All\r\npeople saw the way for packing a Parliament now laid open.--_Swift._\r\nJust our case at the Queen's death.\r\n\r\nP. 638. _Burnet_ says that Musgrave and others pretended:--when money\r\nwas asked for just and necessary ends, to be frugal patriots, and to be\r\ncareful managers of the public treasure.--_Swift._ A party remark,\r\n\r\nP. 651. _Burnet._ Goodenough, who had been under-sheriff of London when\r\nCornish was sheriff, offered to swear against Cornish; and also said,\r\nthat Rumsey had not discovered all he knew. So Rumsey to save himself\r\njoined with Goodenough, to swear Cornish guilty of that for which the\r\nLord Russell had suffered. And this was driven on so fast, that Cornish\r\nwas seized on, tried, and executed within the week.--_Swift._ Goodenough\r\nwent to Ireland, practised law, and died there.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ It gave a general horror to the body of the nation: And\r\nit let all people see, what might be expected from a reign that seemed\r\nto delight in blood.--_Swift._ The same here since the Queen's death.\r\n\r\nP. 654. _Burnet._ The Archbishop of Armagh[5] [1685,] had continued Lord\r\nChancellor of Ireland, and was in all points so compliant to the court,\r\nthat even his religion came to be suspected on that account.--_Swift._\r\nFalse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Michael Boyle, who, when Archbishop of Dublin, was made\r\nchancellor soon after the Restoration (1665), and continued in that\r\noffice to January, 1686, during which time he was raised to the\r\nArchbishopric of Armagh.--SEWARD.]\r\n\r\nIbid _Burnet,_ and yet this archbishop:--was not thought thorough-paced.\r\nSo Sir Charles Porter, who was a zealous promoter of everything that the\r\nKing proposed, and was a man of ready wit, and being poor was thought a\r\nperson fit to be made a tool of, was declared Lord Chancellor of\r\nIreland.--_Swift._ False and scandalous.\r\n\r\nP. 669. _Burnet._ Solicitor-general Finch ... was presently after turned\r\nout. And Powis succeeded him, who was a compliant young aspiring lawyer,\r\nthough in himself he was no ill natured man.--_Swift._ Sir Thomas Powis,\r\na good dull lawyer.\r\n\r\nP. 670. _Burnet,_ speaking of the power claimed for the King to dispense\r\nwith the sacramental test, says:--It was an overturning the whole\r\ngovernment, ... to say that laws, ... where one of the penalties was an\r\nincapacity, which by a maxim of law cannot be taken away even by a\r\npardon, should at the pleasure of the prince be dispensed with: A fine\r\nwas also set by the Act on offenders, but not given to the King, but to\r\nthe informer, which thereby became his. So that the King could no more\r\npardon that, than he could discharge the debts of the subjects, and take\r\naway property.--_Swift._ Wrong reasoning.\r\n\r\nP. 672. _Burnet._ Intimations were everywhere given, that the King would\r\nnot have them [Dissenters], or their meetings, to be disturbed. Some of\r\nthem began to grow insolent upon this shew of favour.--_Swift._ The\r\nwhole body of them grew insolent, and complying to the King.\r\n\r\nP. 675. _Burnet._ Sancroft lay silent at Lambeth. He seemed zealous\r\nagainst Popery in private discourse: But he was of such a timorous\r\ntemper, and _so set on the enriching his nephew,_ that he shewed no sort\r\nof courage.--_Swift._ False as hell.\r\n\r\nP. 681. _Burnet,_ referring to the revived national zeal against Popery,\r\nsays:--The Episcopal clergy were in many places so sunk into sloth and\r\nignorance, that they were not capable of conducting this zeal: ... But\r\nthe Presbyterians, though they were now freed from the great severities\r\nthey had long smarted under, yet expressed on all occasions their\r\nunconquerable aversion to Popery.--_Swift._ Partial dog!\r\n\r\nP. 682. _Burnet._ He made the Earl of Tyrconnell Lord\r\nLieutenant.--_Swift._ Lord deputy.\r\n\r\nP. 688. _Burnet._ Nor were the clergy more diligent in their labours\r\namong their people, in which respect it must be confessed that the\r\nEnglish clergy are the most remiss of any.--_Swift._ Civil that.\r\n\r\nP. 690. _Burnet,_ speaking of King William's character, says:--he had no\r\nvice, but of one sort, in which he was very _cautious_ and\r\n_secret_.--_Swift._ It was of two sorts--_male_ and _female_--in the\r\n_former_ he was neither cautious nor secret.\r\n\r\nP. 691. _Burnet,_ in a conversation with the Prince of Orange at The\r\nHague, (1686):--When he found I was in my opinion for toleration, he\r\nsaid, that was all he would ever desire to bring us to, for quieting our\r\ncontentions at home.--_Swift._ It seems the Prince even then thought of\r\nbeing King.\r\n\r\nP. 692. _Burnet,_ the advice I gave the Princess of Orange, when she\r\nshould be Queen of England, was, to:--endeavour effectually to get it\r\n[the real authority] to be legally vested in him [the Prince] during\r\nlife: This would lay the greatest obligation on him possible, and lay\r\nthe foundation of a perfect union between them, which had been of late a\r\nlittle embroiled.--_Swift._ By Mrs. Villiers, now Lady Orkney; but he\r\nproved a _d----d husband for all that._[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Lady Orkney was a favourite of Swift, as appears from\r\nseveral passages in the Journal. [S.]]\r\n\r\nP. 693. _Burnet,_ having told the Princess of Orange that her succession\r\nto the throne would not make her husband king, and given her the advice\r\njust quoted, says:--she in a very frank manner told him, that she did\r\nnot know that the laws of England were so contrary to the laws of God,\r\nas I had informed her: she did not think that the husband was ever to be\r\nobedient to the wife.--_Swift._ Foolish.\r\n\r\nP. 693. _Burnet._ [Penn, the Quaker,] was a talking vain man, who had\r\nbeen long in the King's favour, he being the vice-admiral's son. ... He\r\nhad a tedious luscious way, that was not apt to overcome a man's reason,\r\nthough it might tire his patience.--_Swift._ He spoke very agreeably,\r\nand with much spirit.\r\n\r\nP. 695. _Burnet._ Cartwright was promoted to Chester. He was a man of\r\ngood capacity, and had made some progress in learning. He was ambitious\r\nand servile, cruel and boisterous: And, by the great liberties he\r\nallowed himself, he fell under much scandal of the _worst\r\nsort_.--_Swift._ Only sodomy.\r\n\r\nP. 696. _Burnet._ [Cartwright] was looked on as a man that would more\r\neffectually advance the design of Popery, than if he should turn over to\r\nit. And indeed, bad as he was, he never made that step, even in the most\r\ndesperate state of his affairs.--_Swift._ He went to Ireland with King\r\nJames, and there died neglected and poor.\r\n\r\nP. 697. _Burnet._ In all nations the privileges of colleges and\r\nuniversities are esteemed such sacred things, that few will venture to\r\ndispute these, much less to disturb them.--_Swift._ Yet in King George's\r\nreign, Oxford was bridled and insulted with troops, for no manner of\r\ncause but their steadiness to the Church.\r\n\r\nP. 699. _Burnet._ It was much observed, that this university [Oxford],\r\nthat had asserted the King's prerogative in the highest strains of the\r\nmost abject flattery possible, etc.--_Swift._ And their virtue and\r\nsteadiness ought equally to be observed.\r\n\r\nP. 701. _Burnet,_ speaking of King James's proceedings against the\r\nuniversities, and that several of the clergy wrote over to the Prince of\r\nOrange to engage in their quarrel, adds:--When that was communicated to\r\nme, I was still of opinion, that, though this was indeed an act of\r\ndespotical and arbitrary power, yet I did not think it struck at the\r\nwhole: So that it was not in my opinion a lawful case of\r\nresistance.--_Swift._ He was a better _Tory_ than I, if he spoke as he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ The main difference between these [the Presbyterians and\r\nthe Independents] was, that the Presbyterians seemed reconcilable to the\r\nChurch; _for they loved Episcopal ordination and a liturgy._--_Swift._ A\r\ndamnable lie.\r\n\r\nP. 702. _Burnet._ [Both Presbyterians and Independents] were enemies to\r\nthis high prerogative, that the King was assuming, and were very averse\r\nto Popery.--_Swift._ Style.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet._ So the more considerable among them [the Dissenters]\r\nresolved not to stand at too great a distance from the court, nor\r\nprovoke the King so far, as to give him cause to think they were\r\nirreconcilable to him, lest they should provoke him to make up matters\r\non any terms with the Church party.--_Swift._ They all complied most\r\nshamefully and publicly, as is well known.\r\n\r\nP. 703. _Burnet._ The King's choice of Palmer, Earl of Castlemain, was\r\nliable to great exception.--_Swift._ Duchess of Cleveland's husband.\r\n\r\nP. 705. _Burnet._ Since what an ambassador says is understood as said by\r\nthe prince whose character he bears, this gave the States a right to\r\nmake use of all advantages that might offer themselves.--_Swift._\r\nSophistry.\r\n\r\nP. 710. _Burnet._ The restless spirit of some of that religion [Popery],\r\nand of their clergy in particular, shewed they could not be at quiet\r\ntill they were masters.--_Swift._ All sects are of that spirit.\r\n\r\nP. 716. _Burnet,_ speaking of \"the fury that had been driven on for many\r\nyears by a Popish party,\" adds:--When some of those who had been always\r\nmoderate told these, who were putting on another temper, that they would\r\nperhaps forget this as soon as the danger was over, they promised the\r\ncontrary very solemnly. It shall be told afterwards, how well they\r\nremembered this.--_Swift._ False and spiteful.\r\n\r\nP. 726. _Burnet._ That which gave the crisis to the King's anger was\r\nthat he heard I was to be married to a considerable fortune at The\r\nHague.--_Swift._ A phrase of the rabble.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet,_ when a prosecution was commenced against Burnet in\r\nScotland, he obtained naturalization for himself in Holland, after which\r\nhe wrote to the Earl of Middleton, saying that:--being now naturalized\r\nin Holland, my allegiance was, during my stay in these parts,\r\ntransferred from His Majesty to the States.--_Swift._ Civilians deny\r\nthat, but I agree with him.\r\n\r\nP. 727. _Burnet._ I come now to the year 1688, which proved memorable,\r\nand produced an extraordinary and _unheard_-of revolution.--_Swift._ The\r\nDevil's in that, sure all Europe _heard_ of it.\r\n\r\nP. 730. _Burnet,_after saying that he had been naturalized in Holland,\r\nupon marrying one of the subjects of the States, goes on:--The King took\r\nthe matter very ill, and said, it was an affront to him, and a just\r\ncause of war.--_Swift._ Vain fop.\r\n\r\nP. 731. _Burnet._ I never possessed my own soul in a more perfect calm,\r\nand in a clearer cheerfulness of spirit, than I did during all those\r\nthreatenings, and the apprehensions that others were in concerning\r\nme.--_Swift._ A modest account of his own magnanimity.\r\n\r\nP. 746. _Burnet._ But after all, though soldiers were _bad Englishmen\r\nand worse Christians_, yet the court [of James II.] found them too good\r\nProtestants to trust much to them.--_Swift_. Special doctrine.\r\n\r\nP. 748. _Burnet_, speaking of the Queen's expectation of a child,\r\nsays:--I will give as full and as distinct an account of all that\r\nrelated to that matter, as I could gather up either at that time or\r\nafterwards.--_Swift_. All coffee-house chat.\r\n\r\nP. 751. _Burnet_. Now a resolution was taken for the Queen's lying in at\r\nSt. James's.--_Swift_. Windsor would have been more suspicious.\r\n\r\nP. 752. _Burnet_, doubting of the legitimacy of the Pretender, and\r\ndescribing the Queen's manner of lying-in, says:--The Queen lay all the\r\nwhile a-bed: And, in order to the warming one side of it, a warming-pan\r\nwas brought. But it was not opened, that it might be seen that there was\r\nfire and nothing else in it.--_Swift_. This, the ladies say, is foolish.\r\n\r\nP. 753. _Burnet_. Hemings, a very worthy man,... was reading in his\r\nparlour late at night, when he heard one coming into the neighbouring\r\nparlour, and say with a doleful voice, \"The Prince of Wales\r\nis dead\"; Upon which ... it was plain, they were in a great\r\nconsternation.--_Swift_. A most foolish story, hardly worthy of a\r\ncoffee-house.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet_. It was said, that the child was strangely revived of a\r\nsudden. Some of the physicians told Lloyd, Bishop of St. Asaph, that it\r\nwas not possible for them to think it was the same child. They looked on\r\none another, but durst not speak what they thought.--_Swift_. So here\r\nare three children.\r\n\r\nP. 762. _Burnet_. The Lord Mordaunt was the first of all the English\r\nnobility that came over openly to see the Prince of Orange.--_Swift_.\r\nNow Earl of Peterborough.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet_. The Earl of Shrewsbury ... seemed to be a man of great\r\nprobity, and to have a high sense of honour.--_Swift_. Quite contrary.\r\n\r\nP. 763. _Burnet_. Lord Lumley, who was a late convert from Popery, and\r\nhad stood out very firmly all this reign.--_Swift_. He was a knave and a\r\ncoward.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet_. Mr. Sidney,[7] brother to the Earl of Leicester and to\r\nAlgernon Sidney. He was a graceful man, and had lived long in the court,\r\nwhere he had some adventures that became very public. He was a man of a\r\nsweet and caressing temper, had no malice in his heart, but too great a\r\nlove of pleasure.--_Swift_. An idle, drunken, ignorant rake, without\r\nsense, truth, or honour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Henry Sidney, afterwards Earl of Romney. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nP. 764. _Burnet_. But, because he [Mr. Sidney] was lazy, and the\r\nbusiness required an active man, who could both run about, and write\r\nover long and full accounts of all matters, I recommended a kinsman of\r\nmy own, Johnstoune, whom I had formed, and knew to be both faithful and\r\ndiligent.--_Swift_. An arrant Scotch rogue.\r\n\r\nP. 764. _Burnet_. The Earl of Nottingham ... had great credit with the\r\nwhole Church party; For he was a man possessed with their\r\nnotions.--_Swift_. That is, Church notions.\r\n\r\nP. 765. _Burnet_. Lord Churchill [afterwards Duke of Marlborough] ...\r\nwas a man of a noble and graceful appearance, bred up in the court with\r\nno literature: But he had a solid and clear understanding, with a\r\nconstant presence of mind. He knew the arts of living in a court better\r\nthan any man in it. He caressed all people with a soft and obliging\r\ndeportment, and was always ready to do good offices.... It must be\r\nacknowledged, that he is one of the greatest men the age has\r\nproduced.--_Swift_. A composition of perfidiousness and avarice.\r\n\r\nIbid. _Burnet_, still speaking of Lord Churchill:--He was also very\r\ndoubtful as to the pretended birth. So he resolved, when the Prince\r\nshould come over, to go in to him; but to betray no post, nor do\r\nanything more than the withdrawing himself, with such officers as he\r\ncould trust with such a secret.--_Swift_. What could he do more to a\r\nmortal enemy.\r\n\r\nP. 769. _Burnet_. [Skelton's] rash folly might have procured the order\r\nfrom the court of France, to own this alliance [with England]; He\r\nthought it would terrify the States; And so he pressed this officiously,\r\nwhich they easily granted.--_Swift_. And who can blame him, if in such a\r\nnecessity he made that alliance?\r\n\r\nP. 772. _Burnet_. The King of France thought himself tied by no peace;\r\nbut that, when he suspected his neighbours were intending to make war\r\nupon him, he might upon such a suspicion begin a war on his\r\npart.--_Swift_. The common maxim of princes.\r\n\r\nP. 776. _Burnet_, speaking of the Declaration prepared for Scotland,\r\nsays that the:--Presbyterians, had drawn it so, that, by many passages\r\nin it, the Prince by an implication declared in favour of Presbytery. He\r\ndid not see what the consequences of those were, till I explained them.\r\nSo he ordered them to be altered. And by the Declaration that matter was\r\nstill entire.--_Swift_. The more shame for King William, who changed it.\r\n\r\nP. 782. _Burnet_, three days before the Prince of Orange embarked, he\r\nvisited the States General, and:--took God to witness, he went to\r\nEngland with no other intentions, but those he had set out in his\r\nDeclaration.--_Swift_. Then he was perjured; for he designed to get the\r\ncrown, which he denied in the Declaration.\r\n\r\nP. 783. _Burnet_, after describing the storm which put back the Prince\r\nof Orange's fleet, observes:--In France and England ... they triumphed\r\nnot a little, as if God had fought against us, and defeated the whole\r\ndesign. We on our part, who found our selves delivered out of so great a\r\nstorm and so vast a danger, looked on it as a mark of God's great care\r\nof us, Who, ... had preserved us.--_Swift_. Then still it must be a\r\n_miracle_.\r\n\r\nP. 785. _Burnet_, when matters were coming to a crisis at the\r\nRevolution, an order was:--sent to the Bishop of Winchester, to put the\r\nPresident of Magdalen College again in possession, ... [But when the\r\ncourt heard] the Prince and his fleet were blown back, it was\r\ncountermanded; which plainly shewed what it was that drove the court\r\ninto so much compliance, and how long it was like to last.--_Swift_. The\r\nBishop of Winchester assured me otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. The court thought it necessary, now in an _after-game_\r\nto offer some satisfaction in that point [of the legitimacy of the\r\nPrince of Wales].--_Swift_. And this was the proper time.\r\n\r\nP. 786. _Burnet_. Princess Anne was not present [at the Queen's\r\ndelivery]. She indeed excused herself. She thought she was breeding: And\r\nall motion was forbidden her. None believed that to be the true\r\nreason.... So it was looked on as a colour that shewed she did not\r\nbelieve the thing, and that therefore she would not by her being present\r\nseem to give any credit to it.--_Swift_. I have reason to believe this\r\nto be true of the Princess Anne.\r\n\r\nP. 790. _Burnet_. [The Prince of Orange's army] stayed a week at Exeter,\r\nbefore any of the gentlemen of the country about came in to the Prince.\r\nEvery day some person of condition came from other parts. The first were\r\nthe Lord Colchester the eldest son of the Earl of Rivers, and the Lord\r\nWharton.--_Swift._ Famous for his cowardice in the rebellion of 1642.\r\n\r\nP. 791. _Burnet_. Soon after that. Prince George, the Duke of Ormonde,\r\nand the Lord Dramlanrig, the Duke of Queensberry's eldest son, left him\r\n[King James], and came over to the Prince.--_Swift_. Yet how has he been\r\nsince used? [referring to the Duke of Ormonde.]\r\n\r\nP. 792. _Burnet_. In a little while a small army was formed about her\r\n[Princess Anne], who chose to be commanded by the Bishop of London; of\r\nwhich he too easily accepted.--_Swift,_ And why should he not?\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. A foolish ballad was made at that time, treating the\r\nPapists, and chiefly the Irish, in a very ridiculous manner, which had a\r\nburden, said to be Irish words, \"Lero, Lero, Lilibulero,\" that made an\r\nimpression on the army, that cannot be well imagined by those who saw it\r\nnot.--_Swift_. They are not Irish words, but better than Scotch.\r\n\r\nP. 795. _Burnet_. The Queen took up a sudden resolution of going to\r\nFrance with the child. The midwife, together with all who were assisting\r\nat the birth, were also carried over, or so disposed of, that it could\r\nnever be learned what became of them afterwards.--_Swift_ That is\r\nstrange and incredible.\r\n\r\nP. 796. _Burnet_, speaking of King James's first attempt to leave the\r\nkingdom, says:--With this his reign ended: For this was a plain\r\ndeserting his people, and the exposing the nation to the pillage of an\r\narmy, which he had ordered the Earl of Feversham to disband.--_Swift_.\r\nAbominable assertion, and false consequence.\r\n\r\nP. 797. _Burnet_, the incident of the King's being retaken at Feversham,\r\nand the subsequent stragglings, gave rise to the party of\r\nJacobites:---For, if he had got clear away, by all that could be judged,\r\nhe would not have had a party left: All would have agreed, that here was\r\na desertion, and that therefore the nation was free, and at liberty to\r\nsecure itself. But what followed upon this gave them a colour to say,\r\nthat he was forced away, and driven out.--_Swift_. So he certainly was,\r\nboth now and afterwards.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. None were killed, no houses burnt, nor were any\r\nrobberies committed.--_Swift_. Don Pedro de Ronquillo's house was\r\nplundered and pulled down; he was Spanish ambassador.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. Jeffreys, finding the King was gone, saw what reason he\r\nhad to look to himself: And, apprehending that he was now exposed to the\r\nrage of the people, whom he had provoked with so particular a brutality,\r\nhe had disguised himself to make his escape. But he fell into the hands\r\nof some who knew him. He was insulted by them with as much scorn and\r\nrudeness as they could invent. And, after many hours tossing him about,\r\nhe was carried to the Lord Mayor; whom they charged to commit him to the\r\nTower.--_Swift_. He soon after died in the Tower by drinking strong\r\nliquors.\r\n\r\nP. 798. _Burnet_, when the Prince heard of King James's flight:--he sent\r\nto Oxford, to excuse his not coming thither, and to offer the\r\nassociation to them, which was signed by almost all the heads, and the\r\nchief men of the University; even by those, who, being disappointed in\r\nthe preferments they aspired to, became afterwards his most implacable\r\nenemies.--_Swift_. Malice.\r\n\r\nP. 799. _Burnet_, when I heard of King James's flight and capture:--I\r\nwas affected with this dismal reverse of the fortune of a great prince,\r\nmore than I think fit to express.--_Swift_. Or than I will believe.\r\n\r\nP. 800. _Burnet_, after relating that King James \"sent the Earl of\r\nFeversham to Windsor, without demanding any passport,\" describes his\r\nreception, and adds:--Since the Earl of Feversham, who had commanded the\r\narmy against the Prince, was come without a passport, he was for some\r\ndays put in arrest.--_Swift._ Base and villainous.\r\n\r\nP. 801. _Burnet_, when it was thought prudent for King James to leave\r\nLondon, the Earl of Middleton suggested that he:--should go to\r\nRochester; for \"since the Prince was not pleased with his coming up from\r\nKent, it might be perhaps acceptable to him, if he should go thither\r\nagain.\" It was very visible, that this was proposed in order to a second\r\nescape.--_Swift_. And why not?\r\n\r\nP. 802. _Burnet_. Some said, he [James] was now a prisoner, and\r\nremembered the saying of King Charles the First, that the prisons and\r\nthe graves of princes lay not far distant from one another: The person\r\nof the King was now struck at, as well as his government: And this\r\nspecious undertaking would now appear to be only a disguised and\r\ndesigned usurpation.--_Swift._ All this is certainly true.\r\n\r\nP. 803. _Burnet_. Now that the Prince was come, all the bodies about the\r\ntown came to welcome him.... Old Serjeant Maynard came with the men of\r\nthe law. He was then near ninety, and yet he said the liveliest thing\r\nthat was heard of on that occasion. The Prince took notice of his great\r\nage, and said, \"that he had outlived all the men of the law of his\r\ntime:\" He answered, \"He had like to have outlived the law itself, if his\r\nHighness had not come over.\"--_Swift_. He was an old rogue for all that.\r\n\r\nP. 805. _Burnet_, speaking of the first effects of the Revolution upon\r\nthe Presbyterians in Scotland, says:--They generally broke in upon the\r\nEpiscopal clergy with great insolence and much cruelty. They carried\r\nthem about the parishes in a mock procession: They tore their gowns, and\r\ndrove them from their churches and houses. Nor did they treat those of\r\nthem, who had appeared very zealously against Popery, with any\r\ndistinction.--_Swift_. To reward them for which, King William abolished\r\nEpiscopacy.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_, The Episcopal party in Scotland saw themselves under a\r\ngreat cloud: So they resolved all to adhere to the Earl of Dundee, who\r\nhad served some years in Holland, and was both an able officer, and a\r\nman of good parts, and of some very valuable virtues.--_Swift_. He was\r\nthe best man in Scotland.\r\n\r\nP. 806. _Burnet_, speaking of Londonderry and Inniskilling, says:--Those\r\ntwo small unfurnished and unfortified places, resolved to stand to their\r\nown defence, and at all perils to stay till supplies should come to them\r\nfrom England.--_Swift_. He should have mentioned Doctor Walker, who\r\ndefended Derry.\r\n\r\nP. 807. _Burnet_. Those, who were employed by Tyrconnell to deceive the\r\nPrince, made their applications by Sir William Temple, who had a long\r\nand well established credit with him.--_Swift._ A lie of a Scot; for Sir\r\nWilliam Temple did not know Tyrconnell.\r\n\r\nP. 807. _Burnet._ Others thought, that the leaving Ireland in that\r\ndangerous state, might be a mean to bring the convention to a more\r\nspeedy settlement of England; and that therefore the Prince ought not to\r\nmake too much haste to relieve Ireland.--_Swift._ That is agreed to be\r\nthe true reason, and it was a wicked one.\r\n\r\nP. 810. _Burnet_, speaking of Archbishop Sancroft, says:--He was a poor\r\nspirited, and fearful man; and acted a very mean part in all this great\r\ntransaction.--_Swift._ Others think very differently.\r\n\r\nP. 811. _Burnet_, speaking of the proposal to establish a regency,\r\nsays:--The much greater part of the House of Lords was for this, and\r\nstuck long to it: And so was about a third part of the House of Commons.\r\nThe greatest part of the clergy declared themselves for it.--_Swift._\r\nAnd it was certainly much the best expedient.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ The third party was made up of those, who thought that\r\nthere was an original contract between the King and the people of\r\nEngland; by which the kings were bound to defend their people, and to\r\ngovern them according to law, in lieu of which the people were bound to\r\nobey and serve the king.--_Swift._ I am of this party, and yet I would\r\nhave been for a regency.\r\n\r\nP. 813. _Burnet_, it was argued that this scheme of a regency was:--both\r\nmore illegal; and more unsafe, than the method they proposed. The law of\r\nEngland had settled the point of the subject's security in obeying the\r\nking in possession, in the statute made by Henry the Seventh. So every\r\nman knew he was safe under a king, and so would act with zeal and\r\ncourage. But all such as should act under a _prince-regent_, created by\r\nthis convention, were upon a bottom that had not the necessary forms of\r\nlaw for it.--_Swift._ There is something in this argument.\r\n\r\nP. 814. _Burnet._ It was believed, that those of his [King James's]\r\nparty, who were looked on as men of conscience, had secret orders from\r\nhim to act upon this pretence; since otherwise they offered to act\r\nclearly in contradiction to their own oaths and principles,--_Swift._\r\nThis is malice.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ [Others thought] that in our present circumstances the\r\nextremity of affairs, by reason of the late ill government, and by King\r\nJames's flying over to the enemy of the nation, rather than submit to\r\nreasonable terms, had put the people of England on the necessity of\r\nsecuring themselves upon a legal bottom.--_Swift._ This was the best\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nP. 815. _Burnet._ There were good authorities brought, by which it\r\nappeared, that when a person did a thing upon which his leaving any\r\noffice ought to follow, he was said to abdicate. But this was a critical\r\ndispute: And it scarce became the greatness of that assembly, or the\r\nimportance of the matter.--_Swift._ It was a very material point.\r\n\r\nP. 815. _Burnet._ It was urged, that, by the law, the king did never\r\ndie; but that with the last breath of the dying king the regal authority\r\nwent to the next heir.--_Swift._ This is certainly true.\r\n\r\nP. 816. _Burnet._ An heir was one that came in the room of a person that\r\nwas dead: it being a maxim that no man can be the heir of a living\r\nman--_Swift._ This is sophistry.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ It was proposed, that the birth of the pretended prince\r\nmight be examined into.... I was ordered to gather together all the\r\npresumptive proofs that were formerly mentioned:.... It is true, these\r\ndid not amount to a full and legal proof: Yet they seemed to be such\r\nviolent presumptions, that, when they were all laid together, they were\r\nmore convincing than plain and downright evidence: For that was liable\r\nto the suspicion of subornation: Whereas the other seemed to carry on\r\nthem very convincing characters of truth and certainty.--_Swift._ Well\r\nsaid, Bishop.\r\n\r\nP. 817. _Burnet._ If there was no clear and positive proof made of an\r\nimposture, the pretending to examine into it, and then the not being\r\nable to make it out beyond the possibility of contradiction, would\r\nreally give more credit to the thing, than it then had, and, instead of\r\nweakening it, would strengthen the pretension of his birth.--_Swift._\r\nWisely done.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ [Some people] thought, it would be a good security for\r\nthe nation, to have a dormant title to the crown lie as it were\r\nneglected, to oblige our princes to govern well, while they would\r\napprehend the danger of a revolt to a Pretender still in their\r\neye.--_Swift._ I think this was no ill design; yet it hath not succeeded\r\nin mending kings.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ I have used more than ordinary care to gather together\r\nall the particulars that were then laid before me as to that matter [the\r\nbirth of the Pretender].--_Swift._ And where are they?\r\n\r\nP. 818. _Burnet_, after relating a long conversation with Bentinck\r\n[afterwards Earl of Portland], adds--Next morning I came to him, and\r\ndesired my _congé_. I would oppose nothing in which the Prince seemed to\r\nbe concerned, as long as I was his servant. And therefore I desired to\r\nbe disengaged, that I might be free to oppose this proposition [to offer\r\nhim the crown] with all the strength and credit I had. He answered me,\r\nthat I might desire that when I saw a step made: But till then he wished\r\nme to stay where I was.--_Swift._ Is all this true?\r\n\r\nP. 819. _Burnet._ I heard no more of this; in which the Marquess of\r\nHalifax was single among the peers: For I did not find there was any one\r\nof them of his mind; unless it was the Lord Colepeper, who was a vicious\r\nand corrupt man, but made a figure in the debates that were now in the\r\nHouse of Lords, and died about the end of them.--_Swift._ Yet was not\r\nthe same thing done in effect, while the King had the sole\r\nadministration?\r\n\r\nP. 819. _Burnet._ The Princess continued all the while in Holland, being\r\nshut in there during the east winds, by the freezing of the rivers, and\r\nby contrary winds after the thaw came. So that she came not to England\r\ntill all the debates were over.--_Swift._ Why was she [not] sent for\r\ntill the matter was agreed? This clearly shews the Prince's original\r\ndesign was to be king, against what he professed in his Declaration.\r\n\r\nP. 820. _Burnet._ [The Prince of Orange] said, he came over, being\r\ninvited, to save the nation: He had now brought together a free and true\r\nrepresentative of the kingdom: He left it therefore to them to do what\r\nthey thought best for the good of the kingdom: And, when things were\r\nonce settled, he should be well satisfied to go back to Holland\r\nagain.--_Swift._ Did he tell truth?\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ He thought it necessary to tell them, that he would not\r\nbe the Regent: So, if they continued in that design, they must look out\r\nfor some other person to be put in that post.--_Swift._ Was not this a\r\nplain confession of what he came for?\r\n\r\nP. 821. _Burnet._ In the end he said, that he could not resolve to\r\naccept of a dignity, so as to hold it only the life of another: Yet he\r\nthought, that the issue of Princess Anne should be preferred, in the\r\nsuccession, to any issue that he might have by any other wife than the\r\nPrincess.--_Swift._ A great concession truly.\r\n\r\nP. 822. _Burnet._ The poor Bishop of Durham [Lord Crewe], who had\r\nabsconded for some time, ... was now prevailed on to come, and by voting\r\nthe new settlement to merit at least a pardon for all that he had done:\r\nWhich, all things considered, was thought very indecent in him, yet not\r\nunbecoming the rest of his life and character.--_Swift._ This is too\r\nhard, though almost true.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet._ Then the power of the Crown to grant a _non-obstante_ to\r\nsome statutes was objected.--_Swift._ Yet the words continue in patents.\r\n\r\nP. 824. _Burnet._ A notion was started, which ... was laid thus: \"The\r\nPrince had a just cause of making war on the King.\" In that most of them\r\nagreed. In a just war, in which an appeal is made to God, success is\r\nconsidered as the decision of Heaven. So the Prince's success against\r\nKing James gave him the right of conquest over him. And by it all his\r\nrights were transferred to the Prince.--_Swift._ The author wrote a\r\npaper to prove this, and it was burnt by the hangman, and is a very\r\nfoolish scheme.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"A Pastoral Letter writ by ... Gilbert, Lord Bishop of\r\nSarum, to the clergy of his Diocess\" [dated May 15th, 1689] was\r\ncondemned by the House of Commons on Jan. 23rd, 169-2/3, and ordered to\r\n\"be burnt by the hand of the common hangman.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nP. 525 (second volume). _Burnet_, speaking of the Act for the General\r\nNaturalization of Protestants, and the opposition made against it by the\r\nHigh Church, adds:--This was carried in the House of Commons, with a\r\ngreat majority; but all those, who appeared for this large and\r\ncomprehensive way, were reproached for their coldness and indifference\r\nin the concerns of the Church: And in that I had a large\r\nshare.--_Swift_. Dog.\r\n\r\nP. 526. _Burnet_. The faction here in England found out proper\r\ninstruments, to set the same humour on foot [in Ireland], during the\r\nEarl of Rochester's government, and, as was said, by his directions:...\r\nSo the clergy were making the same bold claim there, that had raised\r\nsuch disputes among us.--_Swift_. Dog, dog, dog.\r\n\r\nP. 580. _Burnet_, speaking of the interruption in the negotiations for a\r\npeace consequent on the Earl of Jersey's death, adds:--_One Prior_, who\r\nhad been Jersey's secretary, upon his death, was employed to prosecute\r\nthat, which the other did not live to finish. Prior had been taken a\r\nboy, out of a tavern, by the Earl of Dorset, who accidentally found him\r\nreading Horace; and he, being very generous, gave him an education in\r\nliterature.--_Swift_. Malice.\r\n\r\nP. 581. _Burnet_. Many mercenary pens were set on work, to justify our\r\nproceedings, and to defame our allies, more particularly the Dutch; this\r\nwas done with much art, but _with no regard to truth_, in a pamphlet\r\nentitled \"The Conduct of the Allies, and of the late Ministry.\"--_Swift\r\nIt was all true_.\r\n\r\n_Ibid. Burnet_. The Jacobites did, with the greater joy entertain this\r\nprospect of peace, because the Dauphin had, in a visit to St. Germains,\r\ncongratulated that court upon it; which made them conclude, that it was\r\nto have a happy effect, with relation to the Pretender's\r\naffairs.--_Swift_. The Queen hated and despised the Pretender, to my\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nP. 583. _Burnet_, in a conference I had with the Queen on the subject of\r\npeace.--she hoped bishops would not be against peace: I said, a good\r\npeace was what we prayed daily for, but ... any treaty by which Spain\r\nand the West Indies were left to King Philip, must in a little while\r\ndeliver up all Europe into the hands of France; and, if any such peace\r\nshould be made, she was betrayed, and we were all ruined; in less than\r\nthree years' time, she would be murdered, and the fires would be again\r\nraised in Smithfield.--_Swift_. A false prophet in every particular.\r\n\r\nP. 589. _Burnet_, the Queen having sent a message to the Lords to\r\nadjourn, it was debated:--that the Queen could not send a message to any\r\none House to adjourn, when the like message was not sent to both Houses:\r\nthe pleasure of the Prince, in convening, dissolving, proroguing, or\r\nordering the adjournment of Parliaments, was always directed to both\r\nHouses; but never to any one House, without the same intimation was\r\nmade, at the same time, to the other.--_Swift_. Modern nonsense.\r\n\r\nP. 591. _Burnet_. The House of Commons, after the recess, entered on the\r\nobservations of the commissioners for taking the public accounts; and\r\nbegan with [Sir Robert] Walpole, whom they resolved to put out of the\r\nway of disturbing them in the House.--_Swift_. He began early, and has\r\nbeen thriving _twenty-seven years_, to January 1739.\r\n\r\nP. 609. _Burnet_. A new set of addresses ran about.... Some of these\r\naddresses mentioned the Protestant succession, and the House of Hanover,\r\nwith zeal; others did it more coldly; and some made no mention at all of\r\nit. And it was universally believed, that no addresses were so\r\nacceptable to the ministers, as those of _the last sort_.--_Swift_.\r\nFoolish and factious.\r\n\r\nP. 610. _Burnet_. The Duke of Ormonde had given the States such\r\nassurances, of his going along with them through the whole campaign,\r\nthat he was let into the secrets of all their counsels, which by that\r\nconfidence were all known to the French: And, if the auxiliary German\r\ntroops had not been prepared to disobey his orders, it was believed he,\r\nin conjunction with the French army, would have forced the States to\r\ncome into the new measures.--_Swift_. Vile Scot, dare to touch Ormonde's\r\nhonour, and so falsely.\r\n\r\nP. 612. _Burnet_, the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Mohun were engaged in\r\nlitigation; and:--upon a very high provocation, the Lord Mohun sent him\r\n[the Duke] a challenge, which he tried to decline: but both being\r\nhurried, by those false points of honour, they fatally went out to Hyde\r\nPark, in the middle of November, and fought with so violent an\r\nanimosity, that neglecting the rules of art, they seemed to run on one\r\nanother, as if they tried who should kill first; in which they were both\r\nso unhappily successful, that the Lord Mohun was killed outright, and\r\nDuke Hamilton died in a few minutes after.[9]--_Swift_. Wrongly told.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 9: A footnote to the 1833 edition of Burnet says that \"the\r\nduke in the belief of some was killed by General Macartney, the Lord\r\nMohun's second.\" See also Chesterfield's letter quoted in Introduction,\r\nand Swift's own version in the \"Four Last Years,\" p. 178. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nP. 614. _Burnet_ says of the Earl of Godolphin:--After having been\r\nthirty years in the Treasury, and during nine of those Lord Treasurer,\r\nas he was never once suspected of corruption, or of suffering his\r\nservants to grow rich under him, so in all that time his estate was not\r\nincreased by him to the value of £4,000. _Swift_. A great lie.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nP. 669. _Burnet_, speaking of the progress of his own life, says:--The\r\npleasures of sense I did soon nauseate.--_Swift_. Not so soon with the\r\nwine of some elections.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR, BY THOMAS BURNET, ESQ.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the title-page:--_Swift_. A rude violent party jackanapes.\r\n\r\nIn the Life, p. 719, is printed a letter from Archbishop Tillotson,\r\ndated October 23, 1764 [sic, the volume was printed in 1734, the date\r\nshould be 1694], in which he says: \"The account given of Athanasius's\r\nCreed, seems to me no-wise satisfactory; I wish we were well rid of\r\nit.\"--_Swift_ has drawn a finger in the margin of his copy of Burnet's\r\nHistory pointing to this passage.\r\n\r\nP. 722. _Thomas Burnet_. The character I have given his wives, will\r\nscarce make it an addition to his, that he was a most affectionate\r\nhusband. His tender care of the _first_, during a course of sickness,\r\nthat lasted for many years; and _his fond love to the other two_, and\r\nthe deep concern he expressed for their loss, were no more than their\r\njust due, from one of his humanity, gratitude and discernment.--_Swift_.\r\nThree wives.\r\n\r\nP. 723. _Thomas Burnet_. The bishop was a kind and bountiful master to\r\nhis servants, whom he never changed, but with regret and through\r\nnecessity: Friendly and obliging to all in employment under him, and\r\npeculiarly happy in the choice of them; especially in that of the\r\nsteward to the bishopric and his courts, William Wastefield, Esq. (a\r\ngentleman of a plentiful fortune, at the time of his accepting this\r\npost) and in that of his domestic steward, Mr. _Mackney_.--_Swift_. A\r\nScot, his own countryman.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****       *****       *****       *****       *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON THE FREE-HOLDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\n\"THE FREE HOLDER\" was a political periodical written in the form of\r\nessays.

Its purpose was to reconcile the\r\nEnglish nation to the Hanoverian succession. \"These papers,\" notes\r\nScott, \"while they exhibit the exquisite humour and solid sense peculiar\r\nto the author, show also, even amid the strength of party, that\r\nphilanthropy and gentleness of nature, which were equally his\r\ndistinguishing attributes. None of these qualities would have\r\nconciliated his great opponent, Swift, had the field of combat yet\r\nremained open to him. But as he withdrew from it in sullen indignation,\r\nhe seems to have thrown out the following flashes of satire, as brief\r\nexamples of what he would have done had the hour of answer been yet\r\ncurrent.\"\r\n\r\nScott obtained these \"notes\" from a transcription of the original in\r\nSwift's own hand, in a copy of \"The Free holder\" which belonged to Dr.\r\nBernard, Bishop of Limerick. The present text is a reprint of Scott's,\r\nbut the text of \"The Free holder\" has been read with the octavo and\r\nduodecimo editions of that periodical issued by Midwinter in 1716. The\r\ntitles to the essays were not given in the original issue, except that\r\nto No. 9. They were added as a \"Contents\" to the re-issue in volume\r\nform.\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON THE FREE-HOLDER.[1]\r\n\r\nNo. 2. _Dec. 26, 1715_.--_Of His Majesty's Character._\r\n\r\n_Addison._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The Free-holder,\" conducted by Addison, was published on\r\nMondays and Fridays from December 23rd, 1715, till June 29th, 1716;\r\nfifty-five numbers were issued altogether. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was by this [this firmness of mind] that he surmounted those many\r\ndifficulties which lay in the way to his succession.--_Swift_. What\r\ndifficulties were those, or what methods did he take to surmount them?\r\n\r\n_Addison_. It is observed by Sir William Temple, that the English are\r\nparticularly fond of a king who is valiant: Upon which account His\r\nMajesty has a title to all the esteem that can be paid the most warlike\r\nprince; though at the same time, for the good of his subjects, he\r\nstudies to decline all occasions of military glory.--_Swift_. This seems\r\nto be a discovery.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. I might here take notice of His Majesty's more private\r\nvirtues, but have rather chosen to remind my countrymen of the public\r\nparts of his character.--_Swift_. This is prudent.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. But the most remarkable interpositions of Providence, in\r\nfavour of him, have appeared in removing those seemingly invincible\r\nobstacles to his succession; in taking away, at so critical a juncture,\r\nthe person who might have proved a dangerous enemy; etc.--_Swift_.\r\nFalse, groundless, invidious, and ungrateful. Was that person the Queen?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3. _Dec. 30, 1715_.--_The Memoirs of a Preston Rebel._\r\n\r\n[_A Ludicrous Account of the Principles of the Northumberland\r\nInsurgents, and the Causes of their taking Arms_.]--_Swift_. Could this\r\nauthor, or his party, offer as good reasons for their infamous treatment\r\nof our blessed Queen's person, government, and majesty?\r\n\r\nThe same. _Addison_. Having been joined by a considerable reinforcement\r\nof Roman Catholics, whom we could rely upon, as knowing them\r\nto be the best Tories in the nation, and avowed enemies to\r\nPresbyterianism.--_Swift_. By this irony, the best Whigs are professed\r\nfriends to fanatics.\r\n\r\nThe same. _Addison_. But before we could give the word [to retreat], the\r\ntrainbands, taking advantage of our delay, fled first.--_Swift_. An\r\nargument for a standing army.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 6. _Jan. 9, 1715-16_.--_The Guilt of Perjury._\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Though I should be unwilling to pronounce the man who is\r\nindolent, or indifferent in the cause of his prince, to be absolutely\r\nperjured; I may venture to affirm, that he falls very short of that\r\nallegiance to which he is obliged by oath.--_Swift_. Suppose a king\r\ngrows a beast, or a tyrant, after I have taken an oath: a 'prentice\r\ntakes an oath; but if his master useth him barbarously, the lad may be\r\nexcused if he wishes for a better.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 7. _Jan. 13, 1715-16_.--_Of Party Lies._\r\n\r\n_Addison_. If we may credit common report, there are several remote\r\nparts of the nation in which it is firmly believed, that all the\r\nchurches in London are shut up; and that if any clergyman walks the\r\nstreets in his habit, 'tis ten to one but he is knocked down by some\r\nsturdy schismatic.--_Swift_. No--but treated like a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 8. _Jan. 16, 1715-16_.--_The Female Association._\r\n\r\n_Addison_. It is therefore to be hoped that every fine woman will make\r\nthis laudable use of her charms; and that she may not want to be\r\nfrequently reminded of this great duty, I will only desire her to think\r\nof her country every time she looks in her glass.--_Swift_. By no means,\r\nfor if she loves her country, she will not be pleased with the sight.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Every wife ought to answer for her man. If the husband be\r\nengaged in a seditious club or drinks mysterious healths ... let her\r\nlook to him, and keep him out of harm's way; etc.--_Swift_. Will they\r\nhang a man for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 9. _Jan. 20, 1715-16_.--_Answer of the Free-holders of Great Britain\r\nto the Pretender's Declaration._\r\n\r\n_The Declaration of the Free-holders of Great Britain, in Answer to that\r\nof the Pretender_.--_Addison_. Can you in conscience think us to be such\r\nfools as to rebel against the King, for ... having removed a general\r\n[the Duke of Ormonde] who is now actually in arms against him,\r\netc.--_Swift_. Driven out by tyranny, malice, and faction.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. The next grievance, which you have a mighty mind to redress\r\namong us, is the Parliament of Great Britain, against whom you bring a\r\nstale accusation which has been used by every minority in the memory of\r\nman; namely, that it was procured by unwarrantable influences and\r\ncorruptions.--_Swift._ The freeholders will never sign this paragraph.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. How comes it to pass that the Electorate of Hanover is become\r\nall of a sudden one of the most inconsiderable provinces of the\r\nempire?--_Swift_. It is indeed grown considerable by draining of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nNo. 12. _Jan_. 30, 1715-16.--_The Guilt of Rebellion in general, and of\r\nthe late Rebellion in particular_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. The present rebellion [1715] is formed against a king, ...\r\nwho has not been charged with one illegal proceeding.--_Swift_ Are you\r\nserious?\r\n\r\nNo. 13. _Feb_. 3, 1715-16.--_Of those who are indifferent in a time of\r\nRebellion_,\r\n\r\n_Addison_. In such a juncture [a rebellion], though a man may be\r\ninnocent of the great breach which is made upon government, he is highly\r\nculpable, if he does not use all the means that are suitable to his\r\nstation for reducing the community into its former state of peace and\r\ngood order.--_Swift_. He speaks at his ease, but those who are ill used\r\nwill be apt to apply what the boy said to his mother, who told him the\r\nenemy was approaching.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. This law [one of Solon's] made it necessary for every citizen\r\nto take his party, because it was highly probable the majority would be\r\nso wise as to espouse that cause which was most agreeable to the public\r\nweal.--_Swift_. No--for, in England, a faction that governs a weak, or\r\nhonours a wicked prince, will carry all against a majority in the\r\nkingdom, as we have seen by sad experience.\r\n\r\nNo. 14. _Feb._ 6, 1715-16.--_The Political Creed of a Tory Malcontent._\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Article XIII, That there is an unwarrantable faction in this\r\nisland, consisting of King, Lords, and Commons.--_Swift_. This article\r\nis too true, with a little alteration.\r\n\r\nThe same. _Addison_. Article XV. That an Act of Parliament to empower\r\nthe King to secure suspected persons in times of rebellion, is the means\r\nto establish the sovereign on the throne, and consequently a great\r\ninfringement of the liberties of the subject.--_Swift_. No--but to\r\ndestroy liberty.\r\n\r\nNo. 21. _Mar_. 2, 1715-16.--_The Birthday of Her Royal Highness the\r\nPrincess of Wales_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. When this excellent princess was yet in her father's court,\r\nshe was so celebrated for the beauty of her person, etc.--_Swift_. I\r\nhave bad eyes.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. There is no part of her Royal Highness's character which we\r\nobserve with greater pleasure, than that behaviour by which she has so\r\nmuch endeared herself to His Majesty.--_Swift._ What would he say\r\nnow?[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 2: The prince and his father, George I., were now [1727, just\r\nbefore George I. died] at variance. [S.]]\r\n\r\nNo. 24. _Mar_. 12, 1715-16.--_The Designs of His Majesty's Enemies\r\nimpracticable_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. To this we may add ... that submissive deference of his Royal\r\nHighness both from duty and inclination to all the measures of his Royal\r\nfather.--_Swift_. Which still continues.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. There is no question but His Majesty will be as generally\r\nvalued and beloved in his British as he is in his German dominions, when\r\nhe shall have time to make his royal virtues equally known among\r\nus.--_Swift._ How long time does he require?\r\n\r\nNo. 26. _Mar_. 19, 1715-16.--_Considerations offered to the disaffected\r\npart of the Fair Sex_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Several inconveniencies which those among them undergo, who\r\nhave not yet surrendered to the government.--_Swift_. Would he pimp for\r\nthe court?\r\n\r\nNo. 29. _Mar_. 30, 1716.--_The Practice of Morality necessary to make a\r\nParty flourish_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Those of our fellow-subjects, who are sensible of the\r\nhappiness they enjoy in His Majesty's accession to the throne, are\r\nobliged, by all the duties of gratitude, to adore that Providence which\r\nhas so signally interposed in our behalf, by clearing a way to the\r\nProtestant succession through such difficulties as seemed\r\ninsuperable--_Swift_. I wish he had told us any one of those\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. It is the duty of an honest and prudent man, to sacrifice a\r\ndoubtful opinion to the concurring judgement of those whom he believes\r\nto be well intentioned to their country, and who have better\r\nopportunities of looking into all its most complicated interests.--_Swift_.\r\nA motion to make men go every length with their party. I am sorry to\r\nsee such a principle in this author.\r\n\r\nNo. 31. _Apr_. 6, 1716.--_Answer to a celebrated Pamphlet entitled \"An\r\nArgument to prove the Affections of the People of England to be the best\r\nSecurity of the Government; etc.\"_\r\n\r\n_Addison_. This middle method [of tempering justice with mercy] ... has\r\nhitherto been made use of by our sovereign.--_Swift_. In trifles.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Would it be possible for him [the reader] to imagine, that of\r\nthe several thousands openly taken in arms, and liable to death by the\r\nlaws of their country, not above forty have yet suffered?--_Swift._ A\r\ntrifle!\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Has not His Majesty then shewn the least appearance of grace\r\nin that generous forgiveness which he has already extended to such great\r\nnumbers of his rebellious subjects, who must have died by the laws of\r\ntheir country, had not his mercy interposed in their behalf?--_Swift_.\r\nProdigious clemency, not to hang all the common soldiers who followed\r\ntheir leaders!\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Those who are pardoned would not have known the value of\r\ngrace, if none had felt the effects of justice.--_Swift._ And only\r\nhanging the lords and gentlemen, and some of the rabble.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. Their [the last ministry's] friends have ever since made use\r\nof the most base methods to infuse those groundless discontents into the\r\nminds of the common people, etc.--_Swift._ Hath experience shown those\r\ndiscontents groundless?\r\n\r\n_Addison_. If the removal of these persons from their posts has produced\r\nsuch popular commotions, the continuance of them might have produced\r\nsomething much more fatal to their king and country.--_Swift_. Very\r\nfalse reasoning.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. No man would make such a parallel, [between the treatment of\r\nthe rebels, and that of the Catalans under King Philip,] unless his mind\r\nbe so blinded with passion and prejudice, as to assert, in the language\r\nof this pamphlet, \"That no instances can be produced of the least lenity\r\nunder the present administration from the first hour it commenced to\r\nthis day.\"--_Swift_. Nor to this, 1727.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. God be thanked we have a king who punishes with\r\nreluctancy.--_Swift_. A great comfort to the sufferers!\r\n\r\n_Addison_. It would be well if all those who ... are clamorous at the\r\nproceedings of His present Majesty, would remember, that notwithstanding\r\nthat rebellion [the Duke of Monmouth's]  ... had no tendency ... to\r\ndestroy the national religion, etc.--_Swift_. To introduce fanaticism,\r\nand destroy monarchy.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. No prince has ever given a greater instance of his\r\ninclinations to rule without a standing army.--_Swift_. We find this\r\ntrue by experience.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. What greater instances could His Majesty have given of his\r\nlove to the Church of England, than those he has exhibited by his most\r\nsolemn declarations; by his daily example; and by his promotions of the\r\nmost eminent among the clergy to such vacancies as have happened in his\r\nreign.--_Swift._ Most undeniable truth, as any in Rabelais.\r\n\r\nNo. 44. _May_ 21, 1716.--_Tory Foxhunter's Account of the Masquerade on\r\nthe Birth of the Arch-Duke._\r\n\r\n_Addison_. What still gave him greater offence was a drunken bishop, who\r\nreeled from one side of the court to the other, and was very sweet upon\r\nan Indian Queen.--_Swift_. Then, that story is true?\r\n\r\nNo. 45. _May_ 25, 1716.--_The Use and Advantage of Wit and Humour under\r\nproper Regulations_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. I have lately read with much pleasure, the \"Essays upon\r\nseveral Subjects\" published by Sir Richard Blackmore.--_Swift_. I\r\nadmire to see such praises from this author to so insipid a scoundrel,\r\nwhom I know he despised.\r\n\r\nNo. 51. _June_ 15, 1716.--_Cautions to be observed in the reading of\r\nancient Greek and Roman Historians_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. \"History of Free-thinking.\"--_Swift_. Writ by Collins.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. The greatest theorists ... among those very people [the\r\nGreeks and Romans,] have given the preference to such a form of\r\ngovernment, as that which obtains in this kingdom.--_Swift_. Yet, this\r\nwe see is liable to be wholly corrupted.\r\n\r\nNo. 52. _June_ 18, 1716.--_Of State Jealousy_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. It is plain, ... that such a base ungenerous race of men\r\ncould rely upon nothing for their safety in this affront to His Majesty,\r\n[wearing a mark on the Pretender's birth-day,] but the known gentleness\r\nand lenity of his government.--_Swift_. Then the devil was in them.\r\n\r\nNo. 54. _June_ 25, 1716.--_Preference of the Whig Scheme to that of the\r\nTories_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. The Whigs tell us ... that the Tory scheme would terminate in\r\nPopery and arbitrary government.--_Swift._ But Tories never writ or\r\nspoke so gently and favourably of Popery, as Whigs do of Presbytery.\r\nWitness a thousand pamphlets on both sides.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. I shall not impute to any Tory scheme the administration of\r\nKing James the Second, on condition that they do not reproach the Whigs\r\nwith the usurpation of Oliver.--_Swift_. I will not accept that\r\ncondition, nor did I ever see so unfair a one offered.\r\n\r\nNo. 55. _June_ 29, 1716.--_Conclusion_.\r\n\r\n_Addison_. The enemies of His present Majesty ... find him in a\r\ncondition to visit his dominions in Germany, without any danger to\r\nhimself, or to the public; whilst his dutiful subjects would be in no\r\nordinary concern upon this occasion, had they not the consolation to\r\nfind themselves left under the protection of a prince who makes it his\r\nambition to copy out his Royal Father's example.--_Swift_ Then, why was\r\nhe never trusted a second time?\r\n\r\n_Addison_. It would indeed have been an unpardonable insolence for a\r\nfellow-subject to treat in a vindictive and cruel style, those persons\r\nwhom His Majesty has endeavoured to reduce to obedience by gentle\r\nmethods, which he has declared from the throne to be most agreeable to\r\nhis inclinations.--_Swift_. And is that enough?\r\n\r\n_Addison_. May we not hope that all of this kind, who have the least\r\nsentiments of honour or gratitude, will be won over to their duty by so\r\nmany instances of Royal clemency?--_Swift_ Not one instance produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****       *****       *****       *****       *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nABINGDON, Earl of, character of, 279.\r\nAddison, Joseph, Swift and, 15;\r\n  Swift's Notes on the Freeholder, 371-377.\r\nAglionby, Mr., character of, 284.\r\nAlbemarle, Earl of, defeated at Denain, 169, 175;\r\n  character of, 276.\r\nAllies, the, unfair treatment of England by, 104 _et seq_.\r\nAncaster, Duke of, character of, 279.\r\nAnne, the Princess, her behaviour at the birth of the Pretender, 360.\r\n  _See_ Anne, Queen.\r\nAnne, Queen, her treatment of Swift, 10 and _n_., 15;\r\n  offers a reward for discovery of author of\r\n     the \"Public Spirit of the Whigs,\" 15;\r\n  her change of ministry, 19, 31;\r\n  her overtures with regard to peace, 31, 50;\r\n  creates twelve new peers, 38, 39;\r\n  stated to have pressed Marlborough\r\n      to become general for life, 40;\r\n  dismisses Marlborough, 48, 49;\r\n  her conduct of the peace negotiations, _see_ Utrecht, Congress of;\r\n  speech on the terms of peace with France, 151 _et seq_.\r\nArgyle, the family of, Swift on,\r\n   293, 300, 306, 308, 312, 313, 314, 317, 318, 319, 332, 335.\r\nArgyle, Archibald, Duke of, character of, 286.\r\nArlington, Earl of, character of, 334.\r\nAssiento, the, demanded by England, 63, 67, 136, 144, 145, 153;\r\n  the Dutch demand a share in, 130, 138, 140, 141.\r\nAylesford, Earl of, Swift on, 350.\r\nAylmer, Colonel Matthew (Lord), character of, 284.\r\n\r\nBaillie, Robert, 349-350;\r\n  his execution, 351.\r\nBarrier Treaty, the, 41, 80-82;\r\n  inquiry into, 99;\r\n  laid before the House, 100;\r\n  interests of Great Britain sacrificed by, 110-114;\r\n  peace proposals affecting, 134, 135, 138, 140, 143;\r\n  new treaty signed, 180-182.\r\nBavaria, Elector of, peace proposals affecting,\r\n  79, 171, 176, 179, 183, 184, 188.\r\nBaxter, Richard, 337.\r\nBerkeley, Earl of, character of, 279.\r\nBerry, Duke of, declared heir to the French throne, 152, 174.\r\nBlackmore, Sir Richard, 376.\r\nBlackwell, Sir Lambert, character of, 284.\r\nBlunt, Sir John, on the National Debt, 91, 92.\r\nBolingbroke, Henry St. John, Lord, his estrangement from Harley, 13, 16;\r\n  information given to Swift by, 18 _n_.;\r\n  and the Duke of Somerset, 33;\r\n  his interview with Bothmar, 43;\r\n  introduces Prince Eugene to the Queen, 43;\r\n  hated by Eugene, 45;\r\n  his attacks on Walpole, 84 and _n_.;\r\n  his energy in instituting an enquiry into the war, 119;\r\n  his negotiations with Buys, 130;\r\n  orders Ormonde not to fight, 150 _n_., 156 _n_.;\r\n  letter to Thomas Harley on the conduct of the Dutch, 160 _n_.;\r\n  his opinion of Rebellion, 166 _n_.;\r\n  created Viscount, 170;\r\n  his indignation at not being made an Earl, 170 _n_.;\r\n  his mission to France, 171, 172;\r\n  mentioned, 76, 77, 121.\r\nBolton, Charles, Duke of, character of, 274;\r\nBothmar, M., Hanover Envoy,\r\n  memorial of, 42, 43, 129, 167;\r\n  his interview with Bolingbroke, 43, 45, 48;\r\n  deceives his master by false representations, 166.\r\nBoyle, Archbishop Michael, 354.\r\nBoyle, Hon.
