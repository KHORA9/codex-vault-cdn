For this\r\nvery reason alone it is stupid to accuse me of not having recognized\r\nthe greatness of Prince Bismarck. The opposite is the truth. I revered\r\nand idolized him. Nor could it be otherwise. It should be borne in\r\nmind with what generation I grew up--the generation of the devotees of\r\nBismarck. He was the creator of the German Empire, the paladin of my\r\ngrandfather, and all of us considered him the greatest statesman of his\r\nday and were proud that he was a German. Bismarck was the idol in my\r\ntemple, whom I worshiped.\r\n\r\nBut monarchs also are human beings of flesh and blood, hence they, too,\r\nare exposed to the influences emanating from the conduct of others;\r\ntherefore, looking at the matter from a human point of view, one will\r\nunderstand how Prince Bismarck, by his fight against me, himself\r\ndestroyed, with heavy blows, the idol of which I have spoken. But my\r\nreverence for Bismarck, the great statesman, remained unaltered.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still Prince of Prussia I often thought to myself: \"I hope\r\nthat the great Chancellor will live for many years yet, since I should\r\nbe safe if I could govern with him.\" But my reverence for the great\r\nstatesman was not such as to make me take upon my own shoulders, when\r\nI became Emperor, political plans or actions of the Prince which I\r\nconsidered mistakes. Even the Congress of Berlin in 1878 was, to my\r\nway of thinking, a mistake, likewise the \"Kulturkampf.\" Moreover, the\r\nconstitution of the Empire was drawn up so as to fit in with Bismarck's\r\nextraordinary preponderance as a statesman; the big cuirassier boots\r\ndid not fit every man.\r\n\r\nThen came the labor-protective legislation. I most deeply deplored the\r\ndispute which grew out of this, but, at that time, it was necessary for\r\nme _to take the road to compromise, which has generally been my road\r\nboth on domestic and foreign politics_. For this reason I could not\r\nwage the open warfare against the Social Democrats which the Prince\r\ndesired. Nevertheless, this quarrel about political measures cannot\r\nlessen my admiration for the greatness of Bismarck as a statesman; he\r\nremains the creator of the German Empire, and surely no _one_ man need\r\nhave done more for his country than that.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that the great matter of unifying the Empire was\r\nalways before my eyes, I did not allow myself to be influenced by the\r\nagitations which were the commonplaces of those days. In like manner,\r\nthe fact that Bismarck was called the majordomo of the Hohenzollerns\r\ncould not shake my trust in the Prince, although he, perhaps, had\r\nthoughts of a political tradition for his family. As evidence of this,\r\nhe felt unhappy, for instance, that his son Bill felt no interest in\r\npolitics and wished to pass on his power to Herbert.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS GRANDFATHER'S SUCCESSOR\r\n\r\nThe tragic element for me, in the Bismarck case, lay in the fact that I\r\nbecame the successor of my grandfather--in other words, that I skipped\r\none generation, to a certain extent. And that is a serious thing. In\r\nsuch a case one is forced to deal constantly with old deserving men,\r\nwho live more in the past than in the present, and cannot grow into the\r\nfuture. When the grandson succeeds his grandfather and finds a revered\r\nbut old statesman of the stature of Bismarck, it is not a piece of good\r\nluck for him, as one might suppose, and I, in fact, supposed. Bismarck\r\nhimself points that out in the third volume of his memoirs (p. 40),\r\nwhen he speaks, in the chapter about Bötticher, of the oldish caution\r\nof the Chancellor, and of the young Emperor.\r\n\r\nAnd when Ballin had the Prince cast a glance over the new harbor of\r\nHamburg, Bismarck himself felt that a new era had begun which he no\r\nlonger thoroughly understood. On that occasion the Prince remarked, in\r\nastonishment, \"Another world, a new world!\"\r\n\r\nThis point of view also showed itself on the occasion of the visit of\r\nAdmiral von Tirpitz at Friedrichsruh, at the time when he wished to win\r\nthe old Imperial Chancellor over to favoring the first Navy bill.\r\n\r\nAs for me personally, I have the satisfaction of recalling that\r\nBismarck intrusted to me in 1886 the very delicate Brest mission, and\r\nsaid of me: \"Some day that man will be his own Chancellor.\" This shows\r\nthat Bismarck must have had some belief in me.\r\n\r\nI feel no grudge against him for the third volume of his reminiscences.\r\nI released this volume after I had sought and obtained my rights. To\r\nwithhold the volume any longer would have been pointless, since the\r\nmain contents had become known already through indiscretions; were this\r\nnot true, there might have been varying opinions as to the advisability\r\nin the choice of the time for publication. Bismarck would turn over\r\nin his grave if he could know at what time the third volume appeared,\r\nand what consequences it had. I should be honestly grieved if the\r\nthird volume had damaged the memory of the great Chancellor, because\r\nBismarck is one of the heroic figures whom the German people need for\r\ntheir regeneration. My gratitude and reverence for the great Chancellor\r\ncannot be impaired or extinguished by the third volume nor by anything\r\nelse whatever.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the 'eighties I had been summoned to the Foreign\r\nOffice at the behest of Prince Bismarck; it was then presided over by\r\nCount Herbert Bismarck. Upon reporting myself to the Prince he gave me\r\na short sketch of the personages employed at the Foreign Office, and\r\nwhen he named Herr von Holstein, who was then one of the most prominent\r\ncollaborators of the Prince, it seemed to me that a slight warning\r\nagainst this man ran through the Prince's words.\r\n\r\nI got a room all to myself, and all the documents concerning the\r\npreliminary history, origin, and conclusion of the alliance with\r\nAustria (Andrassy) were laid before me in order that I might study\r\nthem. I went often to the home of the Prince and to that of Count\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE HYENA'S EYES\r\n\r\nWhen I had thus become more intimate in the Bismarck circle I heard\r\nmore open talk about Herr von Holstein. I heard that he was very\r\nclever, a good worker, inordinately proud, an odd sort of man, who\r\nnever showed himself anywhere and had no social relations, full of\r\ndistrust, much influenced by whims, and, besides all this, a good\r\nhater, and, therefore, dangerous. Prince Bismarck called him \"The Man\r\nwith the Hyena's Eyes,\" and told me that it would be well for me to\r\nkeep away from him. It was quite apparent that the bitter attitude\r\nwhich the Prince showed later toward Holstein, his former collaborator,\r\nwas forming even at that time.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office was conducted with the strictest discipline by Count\r\nHerbert, whose rudeness toward his employees particularly struck me.\r\nThe gentlemen there simply flew when they were summoned or dismissed\r\nby the Count, so much so that a joking saying arose at the time that\r\n\"their coat tails stood straight out behind them.\" The foreign policy\r\nwas conducted and dictated by Prince Bismarck alone, after consultation\r\nwith Count Herbert, who passed on the commands of the Chancellor and\r\nhad them transformed into instructions. Hence _the Foreign Office was\r\nnothing but an office of the great Chancellor_, where work was done\r\naccording to his directions. Able men, with independent ideas, were not\r\nschooled and trained there.\r\n\r\nThis was in contrast to the General Staff under Moltke. There new\r\nofficers were carefully developed and trained to independent thinking\r\nand action, in accordance with approved principles, and by dint of\r\npreserving old traditions and taking into account all that modern times\r\nhad taught. At the Foreign Office there were only executive instruments\r\nof a will, who were not informed as to the important interrelationship\r\nof the questions turned over to them for treatment, and could not,\r\ntherefore, collaborate independently. The Prince loomed up like a huge\r\nblock of granite in a meadow; were he to be dragged away, what would be\r\nfound beneath would be mostly worms and dead roots.\r\n\r\nI won the confidence of the Prince, who consulted me about many\r\nthings. For instance, when the Prince brought about the first German\r\ncolonial acquisitions (Gross and Klein Popo, Togo, etc.), I informed\r\nhim, at his wish, concerning the state of mind created in the public\r\nand the navy by this move, and described to him the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich the German people had hailed the new road. The Prince remarked\r\nthat the matter hardly deserved this.\r\n\r\nLater on I spoke often with the Prince about the colonial question\r\nand always found in him the intention to utilize the colonies as\r\ncommercial objects, or objects for swapping purposes, other than to\r\nmake them useful to the fatherland or utilize them as sources of raw\r\nmaterials. As was my duty, I called the Prince's attention to the fact\r\nthat merchants and capitalists were beginning energetically to develop\r\nthe colonies and that, therefore--as I had learned from Hanseatic\r\ncircles--they counted upon protection from a navy. For this reason, I\r\npointed out that steps must be taken for _getting a fleet constructed_\r\nin time, in order that German assets in foreign lands should not be\r\nwithout protection; that, since the Prince had unfurled the German flag\r\nin foreign parts, and the people stood behind it, there must also be a\r\nnavy behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMARCK'S CONTINENTAL PREPOSSESSIONS\r\n\r\nBut the Prince turned a deaf ear to my statements and made use of\r\nhis pet motto: \"If the English should land on our soil I should have\r\nthem arrested.\" His idea was that the colonies would be defended by\r\nus at home. The Prince attached no importance to the fact that the\r\nvery assumption that the English could land without opposition in\r\nGermany--since Heligoland was English--was unbearable for Germany, and\r\nthat we, in order to make a landing impossible from the start, needed a\r\nsufficiently strong navy, and, likewise, Heligoland.\r\n\r\nThe political interest of the Prince was, in fact, concentrated\r\nessentially upon continental Europe; England lay somewhat to one\r\nside among the cares that burdened him daily, all the more so since\r\nSalisbury stood well with him and had, in the name of England, hailed\r\nwith satisfaction the Double (_i. e._, Triple) Alliance, at the time\r\nof its formation. The Prince worked primarily with Russia, Austria,\r\nItaly, and Rumania, whose relations toward Germany and one another he\r\nconstantly watched over. As to the prudence and skill with which he\r\nacted, Emperor William the Great once made a pointed remark to von\r\nAlbedyll, his chief of Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe General found His Majesty much excited after a talk with Bismarck,\r\nto such an extent that he feared for the health of the old Emperor. He\r\nremarked, therefore, that His Majesty should avoid similar worry in\r\nfuture; that, if Bismarck was unwilling to do as His Majesty wished,\r\nHis Majesty should dismiss him. Whereupon the Emperor replied that,\r\ndespite his admiration and gratitude toward the great Chancellor,\r\nhe had already thought of dismissing him, since the self-conscious\r\nattitude of the Prince became at times too oppressive. But both he and\r\nthe country needed Bismarck too badly. Bismarck was the one man who\r\ncould juggle five balls of which at least two were always in the air.\r\nThat trick, added the Emperor, was beyond his own powers.\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck did not realize that, through the acquisition of\r\ncolonies for Germany, he would be obliged to look beyond Europe and\r\nbe automatically forced to act, politically, on a large scale--with\r\nEngland especially. England, to be sure, was one of the five balls in\r\nhis diplomatic-statesmanly game, but she was merely one of the five,\r\nand he did not grant her the special importance which was her due.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it was that the Foreign Office likewise was involved\r\nentirely in the continental interplay of politics, had not the\r\nrequisite interest in colonies, navy, or England, and possessed no\r\nexperience in world politics. The English psychology and mentality, as\r\nshown in the pursuit--constant, though concealed by all sorts of little\r\ncloaks--of world hegemony, was to the German Foreign Office a book\r\nsealed with seven seals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCE OF RUSSIAN ENMITY\r\n\r\nOnce Prince Bismarck remarked to me that his main object was to not\r\nlet Russia and England come to an understanding. I took the liberty of\r\nobserving that the opportunity to postpone such an understanding for\r\na long time lay ready to hand in 1877-78, when the Russians might have\r\nbeen allowed to occupy Constantinople--had this been done, the English\r\nfleet would have sailed in without further ado to defend Constantinople\r\nand the Russo-English conflict would have been on. Instead, I\r\ncontinued, the Treaty of San Stefano was forced upon the Russians and\r\nthey were compelled to turn about at the very gates of the city which\r\nthey had reached and saw before them, after frightful battles and\r\nhardships.\r\n\r\nThis, I went on, had created an inextinguishable hatred in the Russian\r\narmy against us (as had been reported by Prussian officers who had\r\naccompanied the Russian army on the Turkish campaign, especially Count\r\nPfeil); moreover, the above-mentioned treaty had been cast aside and\r\nthe Berlin Treaty substituted for it, which had burdened us even more\r\nwith the hostility of the Russians, who looked upon us as the enemy of\r\ntheir \"just interests in the East.\" Thus the conflict between Russia\r\nand England, which the Prince desired, had been relegated far into the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck did not agree with this judgment of \"his\" Congress,\r\nconcerning the results of which he, as the \"honest broker,\" was so\r\nproud; he remarked earnestly that he had wished to prevent a general\r\nconflagration and had been compelled to offer his services as a\r\nmediator. When I, later on, told a gentleman at the Foreign Office\r\nabout this conversation, he replied that he had been present when\r\nthe Prince, after signing the Berlin Treaty, came into the Foreign\r\nOffice and received the congratulations of the officials assembled\r\nthere. After he had listened to them the Prince stood up and replied:\r\n\"Now I am driving Europe four-in-hand!\" In the opinion of the said\r\ngentleman the Prince was mistaken in this, since, even at that time,\r\nthere was the threat of a Russo-French friendship in place of the\r\nRusso-Prussian--in other words, two horses were already to be counted\r\nout of the four-in-hand. As Russia saw it, Disraeli's statecraft had\r\nturned Bismarck's work as \"honest broker\" into the negotiation of an\r\nAnglo-Austrian victory over Russia.\r\n\r\nDespite considerable differences in our opinions, Prince Bismarck\r\nremained friendly and kindly disposed to me, and, despite the great\r\ndifference in our ages, a pleasant relationship grew up between\r\nus, since I, in common with all those of my generation, was an\r\nardent admirer of the Prince and had won his trust by my zeal and\r\nfrankness--nor have I ever betrayed that trust.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of my assignment at the Foreign Office, Privy Councilor\r\nRaschdau, among others, discoursed with me on commercial policy,\r\ncolonies, etc. In these matters, even at that early date, my attention\r\nwas called to our dependence upon England, due to the fact that we had\r\nno navy and that Heligoland was in English hands. To be sure, there\r\nwas a project to extend our colonial possessions under the pressure of\r\nnecessity, but all this could happen only with England's permission.\r\nThis was a serious matter, and certainly an unworthy position for\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERCOURT POLITICS\r\n\r\nMy assignment at the Foreign Office brought a very unpleasant happening\r\nin its wake. My parents were not very friendly toward Prince Bismarck\r\nand looked with disfavor upon the fact that their son had entered into\r\nthe Prince's circle. There was fear of my becoming influenced against\r\nmy parents, of superconservatism, of all sorts of perils, which all\r\nsorts of tale bearers from England and \"liberal circles,\" who rallied\r\naround my father, imputed against me. I never bothered my head with all\r\nthis nonsense, but my position in the house of my parents was rendered\r\nmuch more difficult for me and, at times, painful. Through my work\r\nunder Prince Bismarck and the confidence reposed in me--often subjected\r\nto the severest tests--I have had to suffer much in silence for the\r\nsake of the Chancellor; he, however, apparently took this quite as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nI was on good terms with Count Herbert Bismarck. He could be a very\r\ngay companion and knew how to assemble interesting men around his\r\ntable, partly from the Foreign Office, partly from other circles.\r\nHowever, true friendship never ripened between us two. This was shown\r\nparticularly when the Count asked to go at the same time that his\r\nfather retired. My request that he stay by me and help me to maintain\r\ntradition in our political policy elicited the sharp reply that he had\r\nbecome accustomed to report to his father and serve him, wherefore it\r\nwas out of the question to demand that he come, with his dispatch case\r\nunder his arm, to report to anybody else than his father.\r\n\r\nWhen Tsar Nicholas II, he who has been murdered, came of age, I was\r\nassigned at the instigation of Prince Bismarck to confer upon the\r\nheir-apparent at St. Petersburg the Order of the Black Eagle. Both the\r\nEmperor and Prince Bismarck instructed me concerning the relationship\r\nof the two countries and the two reigning dynasties with each other,\r\nas well as concerning customs, personages, etc. The Emperor remarked\r\nin conclusion that he would give his grandson the same piece of advice\r\nthat was given him, on the occasion of his first visit as a young man\r\nto Russia, by Count Adlerberg, _viz._, \"In general, there as well as\r\nelsewhere, people prefer praise to criticism.\" Prince Bismarck closed\r\nhis remarks with these words: \"In the East, all those who wear their\r\nshirts outside their trousers are decent people, but as soon as they\r\ntuck their shirts inside their trousers and hang a medal around their\r\nnecks, they become pig-dogs.\"\r\n\r\nFrom St. Petersburg I repeatedly reported to my grandfather and to\r\nPrince Bismarck. Naturally, I described, to the best of my knowledge,\r\nthe impressions which I got. I noticed especially that the old\r\nRusso-Prussian relations and sentiments had cooled to a marked extent\r\nand were no longer such as the Emperor and Prince Bismarck in their\r\ntalks with me had assumed. After my return, both my grandfather\r\nand the Prince praised me for my plain, clear report, which was all\r\nthe pleasanter for me since I was oppressed by the feeling that,\r\nin a number of things, I had been forced to disillusion these high\r\npersonages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO OFFER DARDANELLES TO RUSSIA\r\n\r\nIn 1886, at the end of August and beginning of September, after the\r\nlast meeting at Gastein of Emperor William the Great and Prince\r\nBismarck with Emperor Franz Josef, where I also was present at the\r\ncommand of my grandfather, I was commissioned to report personally to\r\nTsar Alexander II concerning the decisions made there and to take up\r\nwith him the questions relating to the Mediterranean and Turkey. Prince\r\nBismarck gave me his instructions, sanctioned by Emperor William; they\r\ndealt most especially with Russia's desire to reach Constantinople,\r\nto which the Prince meant to raise no obstacles. On the contrary, I\r\nreceived direct instructions to offer Russia Constantinople and the\r\nDardanelles (in other words, San Stefano and the Berlin Treaty had been\r\ndropped!). There was a plan to persuade Turkey in a friendly way that\r\nan understanding with Russia was desirable for her also.\r\n\r\nThe Tsar received me cordially at Brest-Litovsk and I was present there\r\nat reviews of troops and fortress and defensive maneuvers, which, even\r\nthen, unquestionably bore an anti-German look.\r\n\r\nTo sum up my conversations with the Tsar, the following remark by him\r\nis of importance: \"If I wish to have Constantinople, I shall take\r\nit whenever I feel like it, without need of permission or approval\r\nfrom Prince Bismarck.\" After this rude refusal of the Bismarck offer\r\nof Constantinople, I looked upon my mission as a failure and made my\r\nreport to the Prince accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince decided to make his offer to the Tsar, he must have\r\naltered his political conceptions which had led to San Stefano and\r\nthe Congress of Berlin; or else, on account of the development of the\r\ngeneral political situation in Europe, he considered that the moment\r\nhad come for shuffling the political cards in another way or, as my\r\ngrandfather had put it, to \"juggle\" differently. Only a man of the\r\nworld importance and diplomatic ability of Prince Bismarck could embark\r\non such a course. Whether the Prince had planned his big political\r\ngame with Russia in such a way that he might, first, by means of the\r\nCongress of Berlin, prevent a general war and cajole England, and then,\r\nafter having thus hindered Russia's Eastern aspirations, cater to these\r\naspirations later, by a stroke of genius, in an even more striking\r\nmanner, it is impossible for me to say--Prince Bismarck never told\r\nanyone about his great political projects.\r\n\r\nIf the above is true, Bismarck, trusting absolutely to his\r\nstatesmanlike skill, must have reckoned upon bringing Germany all the\r\nmore into Russian favor because Russian aspirations were brought to\r\nfulfillment by Germany alone--and that at a moment when the general\r\nEuropean political situation was less strained than in 1877-78.\r\nIn this case, nobody except Prince Bismarck could have played the\r\ntremendous game to a successful end. And therein lies the weakness in\r\nthe superiority of great men. Had he also informed England of his offer\r\nto the Tsar? England must have been opposed to it, as in 1878.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the Prince now adopted the policy which I had already\r\nnoted when I realized the disillusion of the Russians at having stood\r\nbefore the gates of Constantinople without being allowed to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHECY OF RUSSIAN DOWNFALL\r\n\r\nAt Brest-Litovsk, in the course of the constant military preparations\r\nof all kinds, I could easily see that the conduct of the Russian\r\nofficers toward me was essentially cooler and haughtier than on the\r\noccasion of my first visit to St. Petersburg. Only the small group of\r\nold generals, especially those at the Russian court, who dated from the\r\ndays of Alexander II, and who knew and esteemed Emperor William the\r\nGreat, still showed their reverence for him and their friendly feeling\r\ntoward Germany. In the course of a talk with one of them concerning\r\nthe relations between the two courts, armies, and countries, which I\r\nhad found undergoing a change in comparison with former times, the\r\nold General said: \"C'est ce vilain congrès de Berlin. Une grave faute\r\ndu Chancelier. Il a détruit l'ancienne amitié entre nous, planté la\r\nméfiance dans les coeurs de la Cour et du Gouvernement, et fourni le\r\nsentiment d'un grave tort fait à l'armée russe après sa campagne\r\nsanglante de 1877, pour lequel elle veut sa revanche. Et nous voilà\r\nensemble avec cette maudite République Française, pleins de haine\r\ncontre vous et rempli d'idées subversives, qui en cas de guerre avec\r\nvous, nous coûteront notre dynastie.\"[1]\r\n\r\nA prophetic foreshadowing of the downfall of the reigning Russian\r\ndynasty!\r\n\r\nFrom Brest I went to Strassburg, where my grandfather was attending the\r\nImperial maneuvers. In spite of the failure of my mission I found calm\r\njudgments of the political situation. My grandfather was pleased at\r\nthe cordial greetings from the Tsar, which, in so far as the personal\r\nrelationship of the two rulers was concerned, showed no change of\r\nheart. Also, to my surprise, I received a letter from Prince Bismarck\r\nwherein he expressed gratitude and appreciation to me for my actions\r\nand my report. This meant all the more since my statements could not\r\nhave been agreeable to my grandfather and the Chancellor. The Congress\r\nof Berlin had, especially in Russian military circles, done away with\r\nthe remnants of the brotherhood in arms still fostered among us and had\r\nengendered a hatred against everything Prussian and German, stirred\r\nup by association with French officers, which was increased by the\r\nFrench until it developed into the desire of vengeance by means of\r\narms. That was the soil in which, later, the World War ambitions of our\r\nfoes found nourishment. \"Revanche pour Sedan,\" combined with \"Revanche\r\npour San Stefano.\" The words of the old General at Brest have remained\r\nunforgettably engraved upon my memory; they induced me to bring about\r\nmy many meetings with Alexander III and Nicholas II, at which my\r\ngrandfather's wish, impressed upon me on his deathbed, that I watch\r\nover our relations with Russia, has always been my guiding motive.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF AT CHANCELLOR'S DISMISSAL\r\n\r\nIn 1890, at the Narva maneuvers, I was obliged to describe minutely\r\nto the Tsar the retirement of Prince Bismarck. The Tsar listened very\r\nattentively. When I had finished, the usually very cool and reserved\r\nsovereign, who seldom spoke about politics, spontaneously seized my\r\nhand, thanked me for this token of my confidence, regretted that I\r\nhad been brought into such a situation and added, in exactly these\r\nwords: \"Je comprends parfaitement ta ligne d'action; le Prince avec\r\ntoute sa grandeur n'était après tout rien d'autre que ton employé ou\r\nfonctionnaire. Le moment où il réfusait d'agir selon tes ordres, il\r\nfallait le renvoyer. Moi pour ma part je me suis toujours méfié de lui,\r\net je ne lui ai jamais cru un mot de ce qu'il faisait savoir ou me\r\ndisait lui-même, car j'étais sûr et savais qu'il me blaguait tout le\r\ntemps. Pour les rapports entre nous deux, mon cher Guillaume [this was\r\nthe first time that the Tsar so addressed me], la chute du Prince aura\r\nles meilleures conséquences, la méfiance disparaîtra. J'ai confiance en\r\ntoi. Tu peux te fier à moi.\"[2]\r\n\r\nI immediately wrote down this important talk at the time it occurred.\r\nI am objective enough to ask myself to what extent the courtesy of\r\none ruler to another and possibly, in addition, the satisfaction at\r\nthe elimination of a statesman of Bismarck's importance, can have\r\ninfluenced the Tsar, consciously or unconsciously, in making the\r\nabove-mentioned statement. Prince Bismarck's belief in the Tsar's trust\r\nin him was, subjectively, undoubtedly genuine; and, moreover, there can\r\nbe no doubt as to the esteem in which Alexander III held Bismarck's\r\nability as a statesman.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the Tsar remained true to his word up to the day of his\r\ndeath. This, to be sure, did little to change Russia's general policy,\r\nbut Germany, at least, was safe from an attack from that quarter. The\r\nstraightforward character of Alexander III guaranteed this--it became\r\notherwise under his weak son.\r\n\r\nWhatever one's attitude may be toward Bismarck's Russian policy, one\r\nthing must be acknowledged: the Prince, despite the Congress of Berlin\r\nand the rapprochement of France to Russia, was able to avoid serious\r\nfriction. That is equivalent to saying that, reckoning from the time of\r\nthe Berlin Congress, he played a superior diplomatic and statesmanlike\r\ngame for twelve years (1878-90).\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY AS PEACEMAKER\r\n\r\nOne must also lay stress upon the fact that it was a German statesman\r\nwho, in 1878, prevented a general war, even at the cost of weakening\r\nthe relations of Germany to Russia, in the justified belief that he\r\nwould succeed, being a statesman of genius who knew exactly what he was\r\naiming at, in strengthening these relations once more, or, at least,\r\nin avoiding conflicts after he had overcome the crisis threatening all\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in doing that for twelve years and his successors at the\r\nhelm of the ship of state succeeded in doing likewise for twenty-four\r\nmore years.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a Prince I purposely held aloof from party politics,\r\nconcentrating my entire attention upon my duties in the different army\r\nbranches to which I was assigned. This afforded me satisfaction and\r\nfilled up my whole life. For this reason I avoided, while I was Prince\r\nof Prussia, all attempts to drag me into party activities. Often enough\r\nendeavors were made, under the cloak of harmless functions, teas and\r\nthe like, to ensnare me into political circles or for electioneering\r\npurposes. But I always held aloof.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the treacherous malady which killed Emperor Frederick\r\nIII was frankly told me in advance by German physicians called\r\ninto consultation as experts by the English physician, Sir Morell\r\nMackenzie. My deep grief and sorrow were all the greater because it\r\nwas almost impossible for me to speak alone with my beloved father.\r\nHe was guarded like a prisoner by the English physicians and, though\r\nreporters from all countries could look upon the poor sick man from\r\nthe physicians' room, every kind of obstacle was placed in my path to\r\nkeep me from my father's side and even to prevent me from keeping in\r\nconstant touch with him by writing; my letters were often intercepted\r\nand not delivered. Moreover, from among the group of watchers, an\r\ninfamous, organized campaign of slander was conducted in the newspapers\r\nagainst me. Two journalists were especially active in this: one Herr\r\nSchnidrowitz and M. Jacques St. Cère, of the _Figaro_--a German\r\nJew--who slandered him who was later Emperor in the most poisonous way\r\nin France, until the \"Petit Sucrier\" trial put an end to his activities.\r\n\r\nI gave the dying Emperor his last joy on earth when I had the Second\r\nInfantry Brigade march past him, led by me in person. These were the\r\nfirst and last troops seen by Frederick III as Emperor. He delighted\r\nhis son by writing on this occasion, on a little card, that he was\r\ngrateful for having had the pleasure of seeing these troops and proud\r\nto call them his own. This event was a ray of light during the gloomy\r\nninety-nine days, which brought upon me also, as Crown Prince, much\r\ngrief, humiliation, and suspicion. In fulfillment of my duty during\r\nthis crisis, I kept a watchful eye upon all happenings in military,\r\nofficial, and social circles, and was inwardly outraged at the signs of\r\nslackness which I noted everywhere, most especially at the hostility\r\nagainst my mother, which was becoming more and more noticeable.\r\nMoreover, I was naturally deeply hurt at the constant campaign of\r\nslander directed against me which depicted me as living in discord with\r\nmy father.\r\n\r\n\r\nHE BECOMES EMPEROR\r\n\r\nAfter Emperor Frederick III had closed his eyes forever, the heavy\r\nburden of governing the Empire fell upon my youthful shoulders. First\r\nof all I was confronted with the necessity of making changes in the\r\ngovernment personnel in various quarters. The military entourage of the\r\ntwo emperors, as well as the body of officialdom, had grown too old.\r\nThe so-called \"maison militaire\" (military household of Emperor William\r\nthe Great) had been retained in its entirety by Emperor Frederick III,\r\nwithout being required to discharge military duties. In addition, there\r\nwas the entourage of Emperor Frederick III. I proceeded to dismiss,\r\nin the friendliest way, all those gentlemen who wished to go into\r\nretirement; some of them received positions in the army, a few of the\r\nyounger remained in my service for the transition period.\r\n\r\nDuring the ninety-nine days, while I was still Crown Prince, I had\r\nsilently concerned myself with those personages to whom I proposed\r\nlater to give appointments, since the physicians had left me no\r\ndoubt that my father had only a short time to live. I ignored court\r\nor external considerations; nothing but previous achievements and\r\ncharacter moved me to my choice. I did away with the term \"maison\r\nmilitaire\" and transformed it into \"Main Headquarters of His\r\nMajesty.\" In choosing my entourage I took the advice of only one man\r\nin whom I reposed special confidence, my former chief and brigade\r\ncommander, General--afterward Adjutant General--von Versen, a man\r\nof straightforward, knightly, rather harsh character, an officer of\r\nthe old Prussian school, a typical chip of the old block. During his\r\nmilitary service in line and guard regiments he had noted with an\r\nobserving eye the court influences and tendencies which had often\r\nworked to the disadvantage of the officer corps in the old \"maison\r\nmilitaire.\" In this direction the circle of ladies of high position,\r\njokingly known among the officers as \"trente et quarante\" on account\r\nof their age, also played a certain part. I wished to eliminate such\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nI appointed General von Wittich my First Adjutant General and General\r\nvon Hahnke, commander of the Second Infantry Guard Division, chief of\r\nmy Military Cabinet. The latter was a friend of Emperor Frederick III\r\nand, while I was still serving with the First Infantry Guard Regiment,\r\nhe was my brigade commander. These two were men of military experience\r\nand iron principles, who shared absolutely the sentiments of their\r\nmaster, and remained bound to me to the end of their lives by the most\r\nexemplary fidelity.\r\n\r\nAs the head of my court I appointed a man known to me from his youth,\r\nthe former Court Marshal of my father, Count August Eulenburg, who\r\nremained at the head of the Ministry of the Royal House until his\r\ndeath in June, 1921, at the age of eighty-two years. He was a man\r\nof fine tact, uncommon ability, clear insight in court as well\r\nas political matters, sincere character, and golden fidelity to\r\nhis King and his King's family. His manifold abilities would have\r\nenabled him, to the same degree that they had made him known as Court\r\nMarshal throughout Europe, to act with equal success as ambassador\r\nor as Imperial Chancellor. Working with unswerving zeal, endowed\r\nwith winning politeness, he stood by me with helpful counsel in many\r\nmatters--dynastic, family, court, public life. He had to do with many\r\nmen, in all social strata and all walks of life, by all of whom he was\r\nrevered and esteemed, and he was treated by me likewise with friendship\r\nand gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIA'S HAND IS FELT\r\n\r\nAfter consultation with Prince Bismarck, Herr von Lucanus from the\r\nMinistry of Public Worship and Instruction, was appointed chief of the\r\nCivil Cabinet. Prince Bismarck observed jokingly that he was pleased\r\nwith this choice, since Herr von Lucanus was known to him as an able\r\nand enthusiastic huntsman, which was always a good recommendation for\r\na civilian official; he added that a good huntsman was a regular good\r\nfellow. Herr von Lucanus took over his post from His Excellency von\r\nWilmowski. He discharged his duties admirably and, being well endowed\r\nin all pertaining to art, technical matters, science, and politics, he\r\nwas to me a counselor, untiring collaborator, and friend. He combined\r\nwith a healthy knowledge of men a strong dash of refined humor, which\r\nis so often lacking in men of the Germanic race.\r\n\r\nWith Prince Bismarck I had stood on very good and trustful terms ever\r\nsince my assignment at the Foreign Office. Then, as well as before, I\r\nrevered the powerful Chancellor with all the ardor of my youth and was\r\nproud to have served under him and to have the opportunity now to work\r\nwith him as my Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who was present during the last hours of the old Emperor\r\nand had listened with me to the latter's political testament to his\r\ngrandson--_i. e._, his wish as to the special care to be lavished upon\r\nrelations with Russia--brought about my summer trip to St. Petersburg\r\nas my first political act before the eyes of the world, in order to\r\nemphasize our relationship to Russia in accordance with the last wish\r\nof my dying grandfather. He also had \"travel arrangements\" drawn up\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nAn obstacle was placed in the way of carrying out this plan by a\r\nletter from Queen Victoria of England, who, upon hearing of the\r\nprojected visit to St. Petersburg, expressed to her eldest grandson,\r\nin a good-humored but authoritative tone, her disapproval of the\r\ncontemplated journey. She said that a year of mourning must first\r\nelapse, after which my first visit was due to her, since she was my\r\ngrandmother, and to England, it being the native country of my mother,\r\nbefore other lands should be considered. When I placed this letter\r\nbefore the Prince, he gave way to a violent fit of anger. He spoke\r\nabout \"family dictation in England,\" of interference from that quarter\r\nwhich must cease; the tone of the letter showed, he said, how the Crown\r\nPrince and Emperor Frederick had been ordered about and influenced\r\nby his mother-in-law, wife, etc. Thereupon the Prince wished to draw\r\nup the text of a reply to the Queen. I remarked that I would prepare\r\nthe appropriate answer, steering the proper middle course between the\r\ngrandson and the Emperor, and that I would show it to the Prince before\r\ndispatching it.\r\n\r\nThe answer paid heed in its outward form to the close relationship\r\nbetween a grandson and his grandmother, who had carried him in her\r\narms when he was a baby and, in view of her age alone, commanded great\r\nrespect--but, in its essentials, it laid stress upon the position and\r\nduty of the German Emperor, compelled to carry out unconditionally a\r\ncommand of his dying father affecting Germany's most vital interests.\r\nIt stated that the grandson was obliged to respect this command of\r\nhis grandfather in the interest of the country, the representation of\r\nwhich interests had now devolved upon him by the will of God, and that\r\nhis royal grandmother must leave to him the question of deciding in\r\nwhat manner this was to be done. I added that, otherwise, I was her\r\nloving grandson, who would always be grateful for any advice from his\r\ngrandmother, who had derived so much experience from her long reign;\r\nbut that I was, nevertheless, in matters affecting Germany, compelled\r\nto retain my freedom of action; the visit to St. Petersburg, I said,\r\nwas politically necessary, and the command of my Imperial grandfather\r\nwas consonant with the close family relations between me and the\r\nRussian Imperial house; therefore it would be carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Prince approved of the letter. The answer, which arrived after a\r\nwhile, was surprising. The Queen agreed that her grandson was in the\r\nright; he must act in accordance with the interests of his country; she\r\nwould be glad to see him, even if it were later on, at her own home.\r\nFrom that day onward my relations with the Queen, who was feared even\r\nby her own children, were of the best imaginable; from that day onward\r\nshe never treated her grandson except as a sovereign of equal rank with\r\nherself!\r\n\r\nOn my first journeys I was accompanied by Count Herbert, as the\r\nrepresentative of the Foreign Office. He drew up the speeches and\r\nconducted the political conferences, in so far as they were of an\r\nofficial nature, in accordance with the instructions of his father.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFLICT ON TURKISH POLICY\r\n\r\nUpon my return from Constantinople in 1889 I described to the Prince\r\nat his request my impressions of Greece, where my sister Sophie was\r\nmarried to the heir-apparent, Crown Prince Constantine, and also my\r\nConstantinople impressions. In doing this, it struck me that Prince\r\nBismarck spoke quite disdainfully of Turkey, of the men in high\r\nposition there, and of conditions in that land. I thought I might\r\ninspire him in part with essentially more favorable opinions, but my\r\nefforts were of little avail. Upon asking the Prince the reason why\r\nhe held such an unfavorable opinion, he answered that Count Herbert\r\nhad reported very disapprovingly on Turkey. Prince Bismarck and Count\r\nHerbert were never favorably inclined toward Turkey and they never\r\nagreed with me in my Turkish policy--the old policy of Frederick the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nDuring the last period of his tenure of office as Chancellor, Bismarck\r\ndeclared that the maintenance of friendly relations with Russia, whose\r\nTsar reposed special trust in him, was the most important reason for\r\nhis remaining at his post. In this connection it was that he gave me\r\nthe first hints concerning the secret reinsurance treaty with Russia.\r\nUp to then I had heard nothing about it, either from the Prince or\r\nthe Foreign Office, although it happened that I had concerned myself\r\nespecially with Russian matters.\r\n\r\nWhen I assumed the reins of government owing to the early death of my\r\nfather, the generation of the grandson, as I have already remarked,\r\nfollowed upon the generation of the grandfather, which meant that\r\nthe entire generation of Emperor Frederick was overleaped. This\r\ngeneration, through its dealings with Crown Prince Frederick William,\r\nwas imbued with many liberal ideas and projects of reform which were\r\nto be carried out under the direction of the Emperor Frederick. Upon\r\nhis death, this entire generation, especially the politicians, found\r\nitself deceived in its hopes of exerting influence, and felt itself,\r\nto a certain extent, in the position of an orphan. Those belonging\r\nto it, despite the fact that they did not know my inner thoughts and\r\naims, adopted a distrustful and reserved attitude toward me, instead of\r\ntransferring their interest from the father to the son, for the purpose\r\nof furthering the welfare of the fatherland.\r\n\r\nThere was one exception to this--a representative of the National\r\nLiberals, Herr von Benda--a man still in the full bloom of youth. While\r\nI was still Prince I had made his acquaintance at the great hare hunts\r\ngot up by Councilor Dietze at Barby. There Herr von Benda had won my\r\naffection and confidence when I, surrounded by older men, had listened\r\nto discussions on political, agricultural, and national-economic\r\nquestions. In the course of these, Herr von Benda held my attention\r\nby means of his independent, interesting judgment. I accepted with\r\npleasure an invitation to Benda's country seat, Rudow, near Berlin, and\r\nfrom this arose the custom of a regular yearly visit.\r\n\r\nThe hours spent in the family circle at Rudow stand out pleasantly in\r\nmy memory. His talented daughters used to regale us with music. The\r\npolitical conversations there proved Herr von Benda to be a man of\r\ngreat foresight, which, free from partisan considerations, gave him\r\nan open mind as to the general needs of the state to an extent seldom\r\nfound among members of political parties. He gave me many a helpful\r\npiece of advice for the future, drawn from the depths of his faithful,\r\ngenuinely Prussian heart, by which he was attached firmly to the family\r\nof his sovereign; yet he was able to feel broad tolerance for other\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS ATTITUDE TOWARD PARTIES\r\n\r\nThe later periods of my reign proved that I was not hostile to any\r\nparty, with the exception of the Ultra-Socialists; also, that I was\r\nnot anti-Liberal. My most important Finance Minister was the Liberal,\r\nMiquel; my Minister of Commerce was the Liberal, Möller; the leader\r\nof the Liberals, Herr von Bennigsen, was Chief President of Hanover.\r\nI stood very close, especially in the second half of my reign, to\r\nan elderly Liberal deputy, whose acquaintance I made through Herr\r\nvon Miquel. This man was Herr Seydel (Celchen), owner of an estate\r\nin eastern Germany--a man with two clever eyes, which gazed forth\r\nfrom a clean-shaven face. He worked with Miquel in railway and canal\r\nquestions, and was a thoroughly able, simple, practical man--a Liberal\r\nwith a streak of conservatism.\r\n\r\nNaturally, I had numerous dealings and points of contact with the\r\nConservative party, since the gentlemen of the country nobility often\r\nmet me at court hunts and other hunts, or else came to court and served\r\nin court positions. Through them I could become thoroughly informed on\r\nall agrarian questions and learn where the farmer's shoe pinched him.\r\n\r\nThe Free Thinkers, under the \"unswerving\" leader, entered into no\r\nrelations with me; they limited themselves to opposition.\r\n\r\nIn my conversations with Benda and Bennigsen we often spoke of the\r\nfuture of Liberalism, and, on one occasion, Benda made this interesting\r\nobservation: \"It is not necessary and also not advisable to have the\r\nPrussian heir-apparent dabble in Liberalism--we have no use for that\r\nsort of thing. He must be essentially conservative, though he must,\r\nat the same time, combine this with breadth, and avoid narrowness and\r\nprejudice against other parties.\"\r\n\r\nBennigsen agreed with me when I spoke to him of the necessity of\r\nhaving the National Liberals revise their program, which--originally\r\nbearing the motto: \"Maintenance of the German Empire and Freedom of\r\nthe Press\"--had long since rallied the members around the Liberal\r\nbanner--in order that, by such revision, the proselytizing power of\r\nthe old brand of Prussian Liberalism should not be lost among the\r\npeople. Both the Prussian Liberals and the Conservatives, I continued,\r\nmade the mistake of remembering too well the old period of conflict of\r\n1861-66; and, at elections and other political fights, they were prone\r\nto fall back into the habits of those days. That period, I said, had\r\nalready passed into history and come to an end so far as our generation\r\nwas concerned; the present had begun for us with the year 1870 and the\r\nnew Empire; our generation had drawn a line under the year 1866; we\r\nmust build anew upon the foundations of the Empire; political parties\r\nmust shape their course also in this direction and not take over from\r\nthe past stuff that was outworn and, moreover, calculated to create\r\ndiscord. Unfortunately, all this has not come to pass. Bennigsen made\r\na very telling point when he said: \"Woe to the North German Liberals\r\nif they come under the leadership of the South German Democrats, for\r\nthat will mean the end of real, genuine Liberalism! Then we shall get\r\nthe masked democracy arising from below, for which we have no use\r\nhereabout.\"\r\n\r\nThe Conservative party, honorable and faithful to its King,\r\nunfortunately has not always produced leaders of superior endowments\r\nwho were at the same time skillful, tactically trained politicians. The\r\nagrarian wing was at times too strongly marked and was a burden to the\r\nparty. Moreover, memories of the period of conflict were still too\r\nlively. I counseled union with the Liberals, but found little support.\r\nI often pointed out that the National Liberals in the Empire were true\r\nto the Empire and to the Emperor, for which reason they should be\r\nthoroughly welcome to the Conservatives as allies; that I could not and\r\ndid not wish to govern without them in the Empire, and was absolutely\r\nunwilling to govern against them; that North German conservatism was\r\nmisunderstood in some parts of the Empire because of differences in\r\nhistorical development; and that, therefore, the National Liberals were\r\nthe natural allies. It was owing to these views of mine, for instance,\r\nthat I removed Court Preacher Stöcker, a man of brilliant achievement\r\nas a social missionary, from his post, since he made a demagogical\r\nprovocative speech in South Germany, aimed against the Liberals there.\r\n\r\nThe Center party was welded together by the \"Kulturkampf\" and was\r\nstrongly anti-Protestant and hostile to the Empire. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, I had dealings with many important men of the party and managed\r\nto interest them in practical collaboration for the good of all. In\r\nthis Schorlemer (the father) was especially helpful to me. He never\r\nmade a secret of his Prussian loyalty to his King. His son, the\r\nwell-known Minister of Agriculture, even joined the Conservative party.\r\nIn many matters the Center co-operated; at one period it possessed in\r\nits old leader, Windthorst, the keenest politician in the legislature.\r\nNevertheless, in spite of all this, one could not help being aware of\r\nthe underlying Centerist conviction that the interests of the Roman\r\nChurch must always be maintained and never relegated to a secondary\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BREAK WITH BISMARCK\r\n\r\nWhen I was Prince William I was placed for a long time under the Chief\r\nPresident of the Province of Brandenburg, von Achenbach, in order that\r\nI might learn about home administration, get experience in economic\r\nquestions, and, moreover, take an active part in the work. Spurred\r\non by the captivating discourses of Achenbach, I derived from this\r\nperiod of my life a special interest in the economic side of the inner\r\ndevelopment of the country, whereas the purely judicial side of the\r\nadministration interested me to a lesser degree. Improvements, canal\r\nconstruction, highway building, forestry, improvement in all kinds of\r\ntransportation facilities, betterment of dwellings, introduction of\r\nmachines into agriculture and their co-operative development--all of\r\nthese were matters with which I busied myself later on; this being\r\nespecially true of hydraulic work and the development of the network\r\nof railways, particularly in the badly neglected territory of Eastern\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nI discussed all these matters with the Ministers of State after I\r\nhad ascended the throne. In order to spur them on, I allowed them\r\nfree rein in their various domains. But it turned out that this was\r\nhardly possible so long as Prince Bismarck remained in office, since\r\nhe reserved for himself the main deciding voice in everything, thereby\r\nimpairing the independence of those working with him. I soon saw that\r\nthe Ministers, being entirely under Bismarck's thumb, could not come\r\nout in favor of \"innovations\" or ideas of the \"young master\" of which\r\nBismarck disapproved.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry, in short, was nothing but a tool in the hands of\r\nBismarck, acting solely in accordance with his wishes. This state\r\nof things was, in itself, natural enough, since a Premier of such\r\noverwhelming importance, who had won for Prussia and Germany such great\r\npolitical victories, naturally dominated his Ministers completely and\r\nled them despotically. Nevertheless, I found myself in a difficult\r\nposition; the typical answer with which my suggestions were met was:\r\n\"Prince Bismarck does not want that done; we cannot get him to consent\r\nto that; Emperor William I would not have asked such a thing; that is\r\nnot in accordance with tradition, etc.\" I understood more and more\r\nthat, in reality, I had no Ministry of State at my disposal; that the\r\ngentlemen composing it, from long force of habit, considered themselves\r\nofficials of Prince Bismarck.\r\n\r\nHere is an example to show the attitude of the Cabinet toward me in\r\nthose Bismarck days: The question came up of renewing the Socialist\r\nlaw, a political measure devised by Prince Bismarck for fighting\r\nsocialism. A certain paragraph therein was to be toned down, in order\r\nto save the law. Bismarck opposed the change. There were sharp\r\ndifferences of opinion. I summoned a Crown Council. Bismarck spoke\r\nin the antechamber with my adjutant; he declared that His Majesty\r\ncompletely forgot that he was an officer and wore a sword belt; that\r\nhe must fall back upon the army and lead it against the Socialists,\r\nin case the Socialists should resort to revolutionary measures; that\r\nthe Emperor should leave him a free hand, which would restore quiet\r\nonce for all. At the Crown Council Bismarck stuck to his opinion. The\r\nindividual Ministers, when asked to express their views, were lukewarm.\r\nA vote was taken--the entire Ministry voted against me.\r\n\r\nThis vote showed me once more the absolute domination exerted by the\r\nChancellor over his Ministers. Deeply dissatisfied, I talked over the\r\nmatter with His Excellency Lucanus, who was as much struck as I was by\r\nthe situation. Lucanus looked up some of the gentlemen and took them to\r\ntask for their attitude, whereupon they made it clear that they were\r\n\"not in a position\" to oppose the Prince and declared that it was quite\r\nimpossible for anybody to expect them to vote against the wishes of the\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING A COAL STRIKE\r\n\r\nThe great Westphalian coal workers' strike in the spring of 1889 took\r\nthe civil administration by surprise, causing great confusion and\r\nbewilderment, especially among members of the Westphalian provincial\r\nadministration. From all sides came calls for troops; every mine owner\r\nwanted, if possible, to have sentries posted outside his room. The\r\ncommanders of the troops which were summoned immediately made reports\r\non the situation as they had found it.\r\n\r\nAmong these was one of my former barrack comrades, belonging to the\r\nHussar Guard Regiment, von Michaelis by name, who was famous as a wit.\r\nHe rode, alone and unarmed, among the striking crowds of workers,\r\nwho--the early spring being remarkably warm--were camped upon the\r\nhillsides, and soon managed, by his confidence-inspiring, jovial ways,\r\nto set up a harmless intercourse with the strikers. By questioning them\r\nhe obtained much valuable information about the grievances--real and\r\nimaginary--of the workers, as well as about their plans, hopes, and\r\nwishes for the future. He soon won for himself general appreciation\r\nand affection among the workers and handled them so well that complete\r\nquiet reigned in his territory. When I, on account of nervous and\r\nworried telegrams from the big industrial leaders and officials\r\nreceived at the office of the Imperial Chancellor, inquired of\r\nMichaelis how the situation stood, the following telegraphed answer\r\ncame from him: \"Everything quiet excepting the Government officials.\"\r\n\r\nA mass of material was collected, during the spring and summer, from\r\nthe announcements and reports received which showed clearly that\r\nall was not well in industrial circles; that many a wish of the\r\nworkers was justified and, to say the least, entitled to sympathetic\r\ninvestigation on the part both of the employers and of the officials.\r\nThe realization of this, which was confirmed in me when I questioned\r\nmy former private teacher, Privy Councilor Dr. Hinzpeter--a man\r\nparticularly well informed on social phenomena, especially those in his\r\nown province--caused the resolve to ripen in me to summon the State\r\nCouncil, include employers and employees in its deliberations, and\r\nbring about, under my personal direction, a thorough investigation of\r\nthe labor question. I decided that in so doing guiding principles and\r\nmaterial were to be acquired which would serve the Chancellor and the\r\nPrussian Government as a basis for working out appropriate projects for\r\nnew laws.\r\n\r\nInspired by such thought I went to His Excellency von Bötticher, who\r\nat once prophesied opposition on the part of the Chancellor to such\r\naction, and advised strongly against it. I stuck to my ideas, adducing\r\nin support of them the maxim of Frederick the Great: \"Je veux être un\r\nRoi des gueux\" (\"I wish to be King of the rabble\"). I said that it was\r\nmy duty to take care of those Germans who were used up by industry, to\r\nprotect their strength and better their chances of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER CONFLICT WITH CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\nThe predicted opposition from Prince Bismarck was not long in coming.\r\nThere was much trouble and fighting before I put through what I wanted,\r\nowing to the fact that some of the big industrial interests ranged\r\nthemselves on the side of the Chancellor. The State Council met,\r\npresided over by me. At the opening session the Chancellor unexpectedly\r\nappeared. He made a speech in which he ironically criticized and\r\ndisapproved the whole undertaking set in motion by me, and refused his\r\nco-operation. Thereupon he walked out of the room.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure the strange scene had its effect on the assemblage.\r\nThe fury and ruthlessness which the great Chancellor brought to the\r\nsupport of his own policy and against mine, based upon his absolute\r\nbelief in the correctness of his own judgment, made a tremendous\r\nimpression upon me and all those present. Nevertheless, it stood to\r\nreason that I was deeply hurt by what had occurred. The assemblage\r\nproceeded to take up its work again and turned out a wealth of material\r\nfor the extension of that social legislation called into being by\r\nEmperor William the Great, which is the pride of Germany, evincing, as\r\nit does, a protective attitude toward the laboring classes such as is\r\nnot to be found in any other land on earth.\r\n\r\nThereupon I decided to summon a general social congress. Prince\r\nBismarck opposed this also. Switzerland was contemplating something\r\nsimilar, and had thought of convening a congress at Berne. Roth,\r\nthe Swiss ambassador, hearing of my scheme, advised canceling the\r\ninvitations to Berne and accepting an invitation to Berlin. What he\r\nwished occurred. Thanks to the generosity of Herr Roth, it was possible\r\nto convene the congress at Berlin. The material collected as a result\r\nof it was worked out and applied in the form of laws--only in Germany,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nLater on I talked with Bismarck concerning his project of fighting\r\nthe socialists, in case they resorted to revolutionary acts, with\r\ncannon and bayonets. I sought to convince him that it was out of\r\nthe question for me, almost immediately after William the Great had\r\nclosed his eyes after a blessed reign, to stain the first years of my\r\nGovernment with the blood of my own people. Bismarck was unmoved; he\r\ndeclared that he would assume responsibility for his actions; that all\r\nI need do was to leave the thing to him. I answered that I could not\r\nsquare such a course with my conscience and my responsibility before\r\nGod, particularly as I knew perfectly well that conditions among the\r\nlaboring classes were bad and must be bettered at all costs.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the views of the Emperor and the Chancellor\r\nrelative to the social question--_i. e._, the furtherance of the\r\nwelfare of the laboring classes of the population, with participation\r\ntherein by the state--was the real cause of the break between us,\r\nand caused a hostility toward me, lasting for years, on the part of\r\nBismarck and a large part of the German nation that was devoted to him,\r\nespecially of the official class.\r\n\r\nThis conflict between the Chancellor and me arose because of his belief\r\nthat the social problem could be solved by severe measures and, if\r\nthe worst came to the worst, by means of soldiers; not by following\r\nprinciples of general love for mankind or humanitarian nonsense which,\r\nhe believed, he would have to adopt in conformity to my views.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMARCK'S LABOR VIEWS\r\n\r\nBismarck was not a foe to the laboring classes--on that I wish to lay\r\nstress, in view of what I have previously said. On the contrary! He\r\nwas far too great a statesman to mistake the importance of the labor\r\nquestion to the state. But he considered the whole matter from the\r\nstandpoint of pure expediency for the state. The state, he believed,\r\nshould care for the laborer, as much and in whatever manner it deemed\r\nproper; he would not admit of any co-operation of the workers in this.\r\nAgitation and rebellion, he believed, should be severely suppressed; by\r\nforce of arms, if necessary. Government protection on the one hand, the\r\nmailed fist on the other--that was Bismarck's social policy.\r\n\r\nI, however, wished to win over the soul of the German workingman,\r\nand I fought zealously to attain this goal. I was filled with the\r\nconsciousness of a plain duty and responsibility toward my entire\r\npeople--also, therefore, toward the laboring classes. What was theirs\r\nby right and justice should become theirs, I thought; moreover, I\r\nbelieved that this should be brought about, wherever the will or power\r\nof the employers ceased, by the lord of the land and his Government, in\r\nso far as justice or necessity demanded. As soon as I had recognized\r\nthe necessity for reforms, to some of which the industrial elements\r\nwould not consent, I took up the cudgels for the laboring classes,\r\nimpelled by a sense of justice.\r\n\r\nI had studied history sufficiently to guard myself against the delusion\r\nof believing in the possibility of making an entire people happy. I\r\nrealized clearly that it was impossible for one human being to make\r\na nation happy. The truth is that the only nation which is happy is\r\nthe one that is contented, or at least is willing to be contented; a\r\nwillingness which implies a certain degree of realization of what is\r\npossible--a sense of the practical, in short. Unfortunately, there is\r\noften a lack of this.\r\n\r\nI was well aware that, in the unbounded demands of the Socialist\r\nleaders, unjustified greed would be constantly developed anew. But,\r\nfor the very reason that I wished to be able to combat unjustified\r\naspirations with a clear conscience and in a convincing way, it\r\nbehooved me not to deny recognition and aid to justified aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SOCIAL PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nThe policy that kept in view the welfare of the workers unquestionably\r\nimposed a heavy burden upon all the industrial elements of Germany in\r\nthe matter of competition in the world market, through the well-known\r\nlaws for the protection of workingmen. This was especially true in\r\nrelation to an industrial system like the Belgian, which could,\r\nwithout hindrance, squeeze the last drop out of the human reserves of\r\nBelgium and pay low wages, without feeling any pangs of conscience or\r\ncompassion for the sinking morale of the exhausted, unprotected people.\r\nBy means of my social legislation I made such conditions impossible in\r\nGermany, and I caused it to be introduced also in Belgium, during the\r\nwar, by General von Bissing, in order to promote the welfare of the\r\nBelgian workers. First of all, however, this legislation is--to use a\r\nsporting term--a handicap upon German industry in the battle of world\r\ncompetition: it alienated many big leaders of industry, which, from\r\ntheir point of view, was quite natural. But the lord of the land must\r\nalways bear in mind the welfare of the whole nation; therefore, I went\r\nmy way unswervingly.\r\n\r\nThose workers, on the other hand, who blindly followed the Socialist\r\nleaders, gave me no word of thanks for the protection created for them\r\nnor for the work I had done. Between them and me lies the motto of the\r\nHohenzollerns, \"Suum cuique.\" That means, \"To each his own\"--not, as\r\nthe Social Democrats would have it, \"To everyone the same!\"\r\n\r\nI also harbored the idea of preventing to some extent competitive\r\nwarfare, at least in the industrial world of the European continent,\r\nby bringing about a sort of quota-fixing in foreign lands, thereby\r\nfacilitating production and making possible a healthier mode of life\r\namong the working classes.\r\n\r\nThere is great significance in the impression which foreign workers\r\nget in studying Germany's social legislation. A few years before the\r\nwar people in England, under the pressure of labor troubles, awoke\r\nto the conviction that better care must be taken of the workers.\r\nAs a result of this, commissions visited Germany, some of them\r\ncomposed of workingmen. Guided by representative Germans, among them\r\nSocialists, they visited the industrial regions, factories, benevolent\r\ninstitutions, sanatoria of insurance companies, etc., and were\r\nastonished at all the things they saw. At the farewell dinner given\r\nthem the English leader of the workingmen's deputation turned to Bebel\r\nand made this concluding remark:\r\n\r\n\"After all we have seen of what is done in Germany for the workers, I\r\nask you: Are you people still Socialists?\" And the Englishmen remarked\r\nto a German that they would be quite satisfied if they could succeed,\r\nafter long fights in Parliament, in putting through one tenth of what\r\nhad already been accomplished years before in Germany toward bettering\r\nthe condition of the laboring classes.\r\n\r\nI had observed with interest these visits of the English deputations\r\nand marveled at their ignorance of German conditions. But I marveled\r\neven more at a question asked by the English Government, through the\r\nchannel of the English Embassy, on the same subject, which betrayed an\r\nabsolutely amazing lack of knowledge of the progress made in Germany\r\nin the province of social reform. I questioned the English ambassador,\r\nremarking that England, having been represented in 1890 at the Berlin\r\nSocial Congress, must certainly have been informed, at least through\r\nthe Embassy, of the Reichstag debates, which had dealt in a detailed\r\nway with the various social measures. The ambassador replied that the\r\nsame thing had also occurred to him and caused him to have the earlier\r\nrecords of the Embassy investigated, whereupon it had transpired that\r\nthe Embassy had sent the fullest reports on the subject to London\r\nand that thorough reports had been forwarded home concerning every\r\nimportant stage in the progress of social reform; but, \"because they\r\ncame from Germany, nobody ever read them; they were simply pigeon-holed\r\nand remained there ever since; it is a downright shame; Germany does\r\nnot interest people at home.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Briton, with a shrug of his shoulders. Neither the British\r\nKing nor Parliament had enough conscience or time or desire to work for\r\nthe betterment of the working class. The \"policy of encirclement\" for\r\nthe annihilation of Germany, especially of its industry, and, thereby,\r\nof its working population, was, in their eyes, far more important and\r\nrewarding. On the 9th of November (1918) the German Radical Socialist\r\nleaders, with their like-minded followers, joined forces with this\r\nBritish policy of annihilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WELFARE WORK\" AT THE COURT\r\n\r\nIn a small way, in places where I had influence, as, for instance, in\r\nthe administration of my court and in the Imperial Automobile Club,\r\nI laid stress upon the social point of view. For instance, I caused\r\na fund to be established, out of the tips paid for visiting palaces,\r\nwhich was destined solely to the benefit of the domestic staff, and\r\nwhich, in the course of time, reached a magnificent total. From this\r\nfund the domestics and their families received money for trips to\r\nbathing resorts, cost of taking cures, burial expenses, dowries for\r\ntheir children, confirmation expenses, and similar payments.\r\n\r\nWhen I, at the request of the newly founded Imperial Automobile Club,\r\ntook it under my protection, I accepted an invitation to a luncheon in\r\nthe beautiful rooms of the clubhouse, built by Ihne. In addition to\r\nmagnates like the Duke of Ratibor, the Duke of Ujest, etc., I found\r\nthere a number of gentlemen from Berlin's high financial circles, some\r\nof whom behaved rather wildly. When the conversation turned to the\r\nsubject of drivers, I suggested establishing a fund which, in case of\r\naccident, illness, or death befalling these men, should provide means\r\nof livelihood for those whom they left behind. The suggestion met with\r\nunanimous approval, and the fund has had most excellent results. Later\r\non I brought about the establishment of something similar for the\r\nskippers and pilots attached to the Imperial Yacht Club at Kiel.\r\n\r\nSpecial pleasure was afforded me by the Kaiser Wilhelm Children's\r\nHome, founded by me at Ahlbeck, at which, in peace times, between May\r\nand the end of September in each year, a large number of children\r\nfrom the most poverty-stricken working people's districts in Berlin\r\nwere accommodated in successive detachments, each lot staying four\r\nweeks. This home is still under the tried direction of the admirable\r\nsuperintendent, Miss Kirschner, daughter of the former Chief\r\nBurgomaster of Berlin, and it has achieved most brilliant results,\r\nboth in the physical and the psychical domain. Weakened, pale, needy\r\nchildren were transformed there into fresh, blooming, happy little\r\nbeings, concerning whose welfare I often joyfully convinced myself by\r\npersonal visits.\r\n\r\nFor the very reason that I have spoken of my quarrel with Bismarck\r\nas a result of labor questions, I wish to add to what I have already\r\nsaid about his basic position in the matter--an example showing how\r\nbrilliantly the Prince behaved in something that concerned the workers.\r\nIn this, to be sure, he was impelled by nationalistic motives, but he\r\nalso realized at once that it was necessary to protect a large element\r\nagainst unemployment, which caused him to intervene with the full\r\nweight of his authority.\r\n\r\nSometime around 1886, while I was still Prince Wilhelm, I had learned\r\nthat the great Vulcan shipping concern at Stettin was confronted,\r\nowing to lack of orders, with bankruptcy, and its entire force of\r\nworkmen, numbering many thousands, with starvation, which would mean a\r\ncatastrophe for the city of Stettin. Only by an order for the building\r\nof a big ship could the Vulcan shipyards be saved.\r\n\r\nSpurred on some time before by Admiral von Stosch, who wished to free\r\nus once and for all from the English shipbuilders, the Vulcan people\r\nhad set to work courageously to build the first German armored ship,\r\nchristened by my mother in 1874 on her birthday, on which occasion I\r\nwas present. Ever since that time the warships built at the Vulcan\r\nyards had always satisfied naval experts--the concern, however, seldom\r\nbuilt warships.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANCELLOR IN ACTION\r\n\r\nThe German merchant marine, on the other hand, had not dared to follow\r\nthe path courageously blazed by Admiral von Stosch. And now the brave\r\nGerman shipyard company was faced with ruin, since the North German\r\nLloyd had refused its offer to build a passenger steamer, alleging\r\nthat the English, because of their years of shipbuilding traditions,\r\ncould build it better. It was a serious emergency. I hastened to Prince\r\nBismarck and laid before him the matter as I have described it above.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor was furious; his eyes flashed, his fist came crashing\r\ndown on the table.\r\n\r\n\"What! Do you mean to say that these shopkeepers would rather have\r\ntheir boats built in England than in Germany? Why, that is unheard of!\r\nAnd is a good German shipyard to fail for such a reason? The devil take\r\nthis gang of traders!\"\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell and a servant entered.\r\n\r\n\"Have Privy Councilor X come here immediately from the Foreign Office!\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes--during which the Prince stamped up and down the\r\nroom--the man summoned appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Telegram to Hamburg, to our envoy--the Lloyd in Bremen is to have its\r\nnew ship built by the Vulcan Company in Stettin!\"\r\n\r\nThe Privy Councilor vanished in hot haste, \"with his coat tails\r\nsticking straight out behind him.\" The Prince turned to me and said:\r\n\"I am greatly obliged to you. You have done the fatherland, and also\r\nmyself, an important service. Henceforth ships will be built only in\r\nour yards--I'll take care to make this clear to the Hanseatic crowd.\r\nYou may telegraph to the Vulcan people that the Chancellor will\r\nguarantee that the ship will be built in the Vulcan yards. May this be\r\nthe first of a whole lot of such ships! As for the workers whom you\r\nhave thus saved from unemployment, I hope that they will express their\r\nthanks to you!\"\r\n\r\nI passed on the news to Privy Councilor Schlutow at Stettin and great\r\nwas the joy caused thereby. This was the first step upon the road\r\ndestined to lead to the construction of the magnificent German express\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\nWhen I went, after I had ascended the throne in 1888, to Stettin,\r\nin order to place honorary insignia on the flags of my Pomeranian\r\nGrenadiers, I also visited the Vulcan shipyards, at the invitation of\r\nthe directors. After my reception by the directors outside the yards,\r\nthe great doors were flung open and I walked inside. But, instead of\r\nwork and pounding hammers, I found deep silence. The entire body of\r\nworkmen was standing in a half circle, with bared heads; in the middle\r\nstood the oldest workman of all, a man with a snow-white beard, bearing\r\na laurel wreath in his hand.\r\n\r\nI was deeply moved. Schlutow whispered to me: \"A little pleasure for\r\nyou, which the workmen themselves have thought up.\" The old workman\r\nstepped forward and, in pithy, plain words, expressed to me the\r\ngratitude of the workmen to me for having saved them, and, above all,\r\ntheir wives and children, from hardship and hunger, by my appeal to\r\nBismarck about the building of the ship. As a token of their gratitude,\r\nhe asked my permission to hand over the laurel wreath. Most deeply\r\nmoved, I took the wreath and expressed my pleasure at receiving my\r\nfirst laurels, without the shedding of a drop of blood, from the hands\r\nof honest German workmen.\r\n\r\nThat was in the year 1888! In those days, the German laboring classes\r\nknew how to appreciate the blessing of labor.\r\n\r\n  [1] \"It is that confounded Congress of Berlin. A serious mistake on\r\n      the part of the Chancellor. He has destroyed the old friendship\r\n      between us, sown distrust in the hearts of the Court and the\r\n      Government, and engendered the idea of a great injustice done\r\n      the Russian army after its bloody 1877 campaign, for which it\r\n      wishes revenge. And here we are by the side of that damned French\r\n      Republic, full of hate for you and of subversive ideas, which, in\r\n      case of a war against you, will cost us our dynasty.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] \"I understand perfectly your line of action; the Prince, with all\r\n      his greatness, was, after all, merely your employee or official.\r\n      As soon as he refused to follow your orders, it was necessary\r\n      to dismiss him. As for me, I always distrusted him, and I never\r\n      believed a word of what he had told me or said to me himself,\r\n      for I was sure and knew that he was hoaxing me all the time. As\r\n      to the relations between us two, my dear William, the downfall\r\n      of the Prince will have the best of results; distrust will\r\n      disappear. I have confidence in you. You can trust me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCaprivi\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I began my reign, General von Caprivi was Chief of the Admiralty.\r\nHe was the last general to hold this post. I at once took energetically\r\nin hand the development and reform--in fact, one may say the foundation\r\nanew--of the Imperial German Navy, based on my preliminary studies in\r\nEngland and at home. That was not to the liking of the General, who was\r\nable, but rather self-willed, and not entirely devoid of pride.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably he had rendered valuable services in mobilization,\r\nimprovement of the officer corps, and the improvement and development\r\nof the torpedo-boat organization. On the other hand, the building of\r\nships and the replacement of worn-out material were in a deplorable\r\nstate, to the detriment of the fleet and to the dissatisfaction of\r\nthe shipbuilding industry, which was growing and looking about for\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nBeing an old Prussian general, Caprivi's way of thinking was that of\r\nhis day--that of his comrades of 1864, 1865, 1870, 1871--in his eyes,\r\nthe army had always done everything and would continue to do so in\r\nthe future; therefore, no great demands for money to be devoted to the\r\nnavy should be imposed upon the country, since, should this be done,\r\nthere was danger that the sums destined to the army might be decreased\r\nand its development thereby hampered. This idea, from which he was\r\nnot to be dissuaded, is false. The amounts granted did not flow into\r\na reservoir from which they might be directed, by the mere turning of\r\na valve, now into army, now into navy, channels. Whenever Caprivi was\r\nunwilling to demand anything for naval construction, in order, by so\r\ndoing, to turn more money toward the army, things did not happen as he\r\nforesaw. By his action the army received not one penny more, but merely\r\nwhatever the Minister of War asked for and received in accordance with\r\nhis budget.\r\n\r\nThere was need of creating a Secretaryship of State for the Navy which,\r\nentirely independent of the Ministry of War, should have as its duty\r\nto demand and obtain for the navy as much as was required for the\r\nprotection of our commerce and colonies. And that is what came to pass\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nCaprivi soon came to me with the request that I relieve him from\r\nhis post. He stated that he was not satisfied with it in itself;\r\nthat, moreover, I had all sorts of plans for the future affecting\r\nthe navy which he considered impossible of realization, in the first\r\nplace, because there existed no means of replacement for the officer\r\ncorps--at that time the yearly influx of cadets was between sixty and\r\neighty--and a large navy without a large officer corps was unthinkable.\r\nIn addition to this, he informed me, he had soon seen in the course of\r\nthe inspection tours of His Majesty that the Emperor knew more about\r\nnaval matters than he, the General, which placed him in an impossible\r\nsituation in relation to his subordinates.\r\n\r\nIn view of these circumstances, I parted with him, placing him in\r\ncommand of an army corps. Following the motto, \"The navy for the\r\nseamen!\" I chose, for the first time, an admiral as its chief, a step\r\nwhich was received in maritime circles with great joy. The man chosen\r\nwas Admiral Count Monts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMARCK'S SUCCESSOR\r\n\r\nWhen I was soon afterward confronted with the rather unexpected\r\nretirement of Prince Bismarck, I found the choice of his successor\r\na difficult one. Whoever it might be was sure to have a hard task,\r\nwithout any prospect of appreciation for what he might achieve; he\r\nwould be looked upon as the usurper of a post to which he was not\r\nentitled, and which he was not qualified to fill. Criticism, criticism,\r\nnothing but criticism--that was sure to be the daily bread upon which\r\nthe new Chancellor must reckon; and he was also certain of becoming\r\nthe target for the hostility of all those who favored Prince Bismarck\r\nas well as with that of the many who previously could not do enough in\r\nopposition to him. There was bound to be a strong current of enmity\r\ntoward the new Chancellor, in which the old Prince himself would not\r\nbe the least serious factor.\r\n\r\nAfter taking all this into consideration, it was decided to choose a\r\nman belonging to Prince Bismarck's generation, who had held a leading\r\nposition in the wars and had already filled a Government position under\r\nhim. Hence Caprivi was chosen. His age was a guarantee that he would be\r\na careful and calm adviser for the \"orphaned\" young Emperor.\r\n\r\nVery soon the question arose of the extension of the reinsurance treaty\r\nwith Russia. Caprivi declared that, out of consideration for Austria,\r\nhe was unable to renew it, since the threat against Austria contained\r\ntherein, when it became known in Vienna--as it almost unavoidably\r\nwould--was such as to lead to very disagreeable consequences. For\r\nthis reason the treaty lapsed. To my way of thinking, it had already\r\nlost its main value from the fact that the Russians no longer stood\r\nwhole-heartedly behind it. I was confirmed in this view by a memorial\r\nwritten by Count Berchem, Under Secretary of State, who had worked with\r\nPrince Bismarck.\r\n\r\nThe Agrarian Conservatives opposed Caprivi as a man without landed\r\nproperty and a violent fight raged around the commercial treaties.\r\nThese difficulties were greatly enhanced because Prince Bismarck,\r\nignoring his former maxims, took part in the fight against his\r\nsuccessor with all his characteristic energy. Thus arose the\r\nopposition of the Conservatives against the Government and the\r\nCrown, and the Prince in person sowed the seed from which later\r\ngrew the \"misunderstood Bismarck\" and that \"Reichsverdrossenheit\"\r\n(unfriendliness to the Empire) so often taken up in the newspapers. The\r\n\"misunderstood Bismarck\" created permanent opposition throughout my\r\nreign against my suggestions and aims by means of quotations, speeches,\r\nand writings, as well as by passive resistance and thoughtless\r\ncriticism. Everything that was done was painted in black colors,\r\nmade ridiculous, and criticized from top to bottom, by a press that\r\nplaced itself quite willingly at the disposal of the Prince and often\r\nout-Bismarcked Bismarck in its behavior.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon became most apparent at the time of the acquisition of\r\nHeligoland. This island, lying close in front of the great waterways\r\nleading to the principal Hanseatic commercial ports, was, in the\r\nhands of the British, a constant menace to Hamburg and Bremen and\r\nrendered impossible any project for building up a navy. Owing to this,\r\nI had firmly resolved to win back this formerly German island to its\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEAL FOR HELIGOLAND\r\n\r\nThe way to cause England to give up the red rock of Heligoland was\r\nfound in the colonial domain. Lord Salisbury proved inclined to\r\nexchange the \"barren rock\" for Zanzibar and Witu in East Africa.\r\nFrom commercial sources and the reports of the commanders of German\r\ncruisers and gunboats which were stationed there and cruised along\r\nthe coast of the recently acquired German East African colonies, I\r\nknew that, as soon as Togo, Dar-es-Salaam, etc., rose to prosperity,\r\nthe importance of Zanzibar on the coast of Africa as the principal\r\nport of transshipment would be a thing of the past, since, as soon as\r\nthe above-mentioned harbors were made deep enough and provided with\r\nsufficient cargo-loading equipment for trading steamers, there would no\r\nlonger be any need of ferrying goods coming from the interior in dhows\r\nto Zanzibar, in order to have them again loaded on vessels there, since\r\nthey could be loaded direct at the new harbors along the coast.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I was convinced that we had, first, an acceptable asset\r\nfor swapping purposes, and, secondly, a good opportunity to avoid\r\ncolonial friction with England and come to a friendly understanding\r\nwith her. Caprivi agreed, the negotiations were concluded, and one\r\nevening, shortly before dinner, I was able to tell the Empress and a\r\nfew intimates the exceedingly joyful tidings that Heligoland had become\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nA first and very important extension of the Empire had been\r\nachieved--without bloodshed--the first condition for the upbuilding of\r\nthe fleet was fulfilled, something which the natives of the Hanseatic\r\ntowns and the rest of the North Germans had wished for centuries had\r\ncome to pass. In silence, an important event had occurred.\r\n\r\nHad Heligoland been acquired in the Chancellorship of Prince Bismarck,\r\nit would probably have been valued very highly. Having happened under\r\nCaprivi, it loosed a lot of criticism. It was merely Caprivi, the\r\nusurper, who had had the audacity to sit in the Prince's chair, and\r\nthe \"irresponsible,\" \"ungrateful,\" \"impulsive\" young master who had\r\ndone such a thing! Had Bismarck only wished, he could have had the old\r\nrock any day, but he never would have been so unskillful as to give up\r\nto the English for it the very promising African possessions, and he\r\nnever would have allowed himself to be thus worsted. That was the sort\r\nof thing heard almost everywhere. The newspapers of the Prince joined\r\nloudly in this sort of criticism, to the great grief of the people of\r\nthe Hanseatic cities.\r\n\r\nCurious indeed were the criticisms occasioned by the swapping of\r\nZanzibar and Witu, which appeared in the Bismarckian press, although\r\npreviously, when I worked under him, these newspapers had always\r\nexplained that he had not much belief in the value of colonies in\r\nthemselves and looked upon them merely as objects to be exchanged,\r\npossibly, for something else, in deals with the British. His successor\r\nacted according to these ideas in the Heligoland question, and was\r\nmost violently criticized and attacked. Not until the World War was\r\non did I see articles in the German press which unreservedly admitted\r\nthe acquisition of Heligoland to be an act of far-sighted politics\r\nand added reflections as to what would doubtless have happened if\r\nHeligoland had not become German.\r\n\r\nThe German nation has every reason to be thankful to Count Caprivi\r\nfor this achievement, since thereby the building of its navy and its\r\nvictory at the Skagerrak were made possible. As for the German navy, it\r\nlong ago acknowledged this.\r\n\r\nThe school law of Count Zedlitz aroused violent new conflicts. When\r\nthey led to Zedlitz's retirement, the cry arose among his adherents:\r\n\"If the Count goes, so must the Chancellor.\"\r\n\r\nCaprivi left his post, in a calm, dignified manner. He tried honestly,\r\nwithin the measure of his powers and abilities, to continue the\r\ntraditions of Prince Bismarck. In this he found little support among\r\nthe political parties, and, for this reason, all the more criticism and\r\nhostility in the public and among those who, had they acted for the\r\nright and the interests of the state, should have stood by him. Without\r\none word of apology, Caprivi, in noble silence, lived all the rest of\r\nhis life in almost solitary retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHohenlohe\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain I was confronted with the difficult task of choosing a\r\nChancellor. His position and activities were to be under somewhat about\r\nthe same auspices and subject to the same conditions as in the case\r\nof his predecessor. But now there was more of a desire that he should\r\nbe a statesman, an older man, of course, qualified to inspire Prince\r\nBismarck with more confidence than a mere general could do.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed that a statesman would know better how to walk in the\r\nfootsteps of the Prince, politically speaking; and provide Bismarck\r\nwith less opportunity for criticism and attacks. These latter had\r\ntended to create gradually among all Government officials, who dated\r\nmostly from the period of Bismarck, an unmistakable nervousness and\r\ndissatisfaction, by which the work of the entire governmental system\r\nwas impaired to an extent by no means inconsiderable. Moreover, it\r\nlent to the opposition in the Reichstag a constantly renewed strength\r\ndrawn from elements previously faithful to the Government, and made\r\nitself felt in a detrimental manner. Especially in the Foreign Office,\r\nthe spirit of Holstein, the supposed representative of the \"old,\r\ntried Bismarckian traditions,\" began to assert itself, so that the\r\nunwillingness to collaborate with the Emperor became particularly\r\nstrong and the belief grew up that it was necessary to carry on,\r\nindependently, the policy of Bismarck.\r\n\r\nAfter mature deliberation, I decided to intrust the post of Chancellor\r\nto Prince Hohenlohe, who was then Governor of Alsace-Lorraine. At the\r\noutbreak of the War of 1870 he had succeeded, as Bavarian Minister, in\r\ngetting Bavaria to enter the war on the side of Prussia. Ever since he\r\nhad been highly esteemed by Prince Bismarck on account of his fidelity\r\nto the Empire. It was natural to expect that Bismarck's opposition\r\nwould cool off when confronted with such a successor. Thus, the choice\r\nof Hohenlohe as Chancellor was strongly influenced by consideration for\r\nPrince Bismarck and for the public opinion inspired by him.\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe was the typical old-style grand seigneur. He was\r\nthoroughly urbane by nature and in his dealings with others: a man of\r\nrefined mind, with a slight touch of playful irony sometimes glinting\r\nthrough, keen on account of his years, a level-headed observer and\r\njudge of men. Despite the great difference in age between him and me he\r\ngot along very well with me, which was shown on the surface by the fact\r\nthat he was treated both by the Empress and by myself as our uncle, and\r\naddressed as such, which brought about a certain atmosphere of intimate\r\nconfidence in our intercourse. In his talks with me, especially in\r\ngiving his opinion as to appointments of officials, he offered very\r\ncharacteristic descriptions of the gentlemen being discussed, often\r\ncombined with philosophical observations which proved that he had\r\nreflected deeply on life and humanity, and which were evidence of a\r\nmaturity and wisdom grounded on experience.\r\n\r\nSomething happened during the first period of Hohenlohe's régime as\r\nChancellor which throws an interesting light upon the relations between\r\nFrance and Russia. Having, at the time of the fraternization between\r\nRussia and France, received reliable information from the General\r\nStaff as well as from our Embassy at Paris to the effect that France\r\ncontemplated withdrawing a portion of her troops from Algeria, in\r\norder to shift them to southern France either against Italy or against\r\nAlsace, I apprised Tsar Nicholas II of this news, adding the remark\r\nthat I should be obliged to adopt counter-measures unless the Tsar\r\ncould dissuade his ally from so provocative a step.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME DIPLOMATIC FENCING\r\n\r\nAt that time the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs was Prince\r\nLobanoff, formerly ambassador at Vienna, well known for his pro-French\r\nproclivities. During the summer of 1895 he had visited France and been\r\nvery cordially entertained. During the autumn, just as I was staying\r\nfor the hunting at Hubertusstock on the Schorfheide near Eberswalde,\r\nPrince Lobanoff, on his return journey from Paris, requested to be\r\nreceived in audience, at the behest of the Tsar. Upon being received\r\nby me he described the calm and sensible frame of mind which he\r\nhad found in Paris and sought to quiet me, too, with regard to the\r\nabove-mentioned troop movements, which, according to him, were mere\r\nempty rumor and chatter without any real basis. He added that he was\r\nbringing to me the most quieting assurances, that there was no reason\r\nfor my feeling the slightest alarm. I thanked him heartily for his\r\nreport, remarking that the word \"alarm\" was not to be found in the\r\ndictionary of a German officer; and I added that, if France and Russia\r\nwished to make war, I could not prevent it.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Prince, piously casting up his eyes toward heaven, made\r\nthe sign of the cross and said: \"Oh, la guerre! quelle idée; qui y\r\npense?--cela ne doit pas être\" (\"Oh, war! what an idea; who thinks\r\nof such a thing? it must not be\"). To that I replied that I, in any\r\nevent, was not thinking about it, but that an observer--and he need not\r\nbe very keen eyed--must assuredly consider the constant celebrations\r\nand speeches, as well as the official and unofficial visits exchanged\r\nbetween Paris and St. Petersburg, as significant symptoms which\r\ncould not be ignored, and which were calculated to arouse great\r\ndissatisfaction in Germany; that, should it come to war, against my own\r\nwill and that of my people, I felt that, trusting in God and in my army\r\nand people, it would be possible for Germany to get the better of both\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nTo this I added still another statement, reported to me from Paris,\r\nwhich had been made by a Russian officer who was in France as a member\r\nof an officers' deputation. Having been asked by a French comrade\r\nwhether the Russians believed that they could beat the Germans, the\r\ngallant Slav replied: \"Non, mon ami, nous serons battus à plate\r\ncouture, mais qu'est-ce que ça fait? Nous aurons la République\" (\"No,\r\nmy friend, we shall be thoroughly beaten, but what does that matter? We\r\nshall get a republic\").\r\n\r\nAt first the Prince eyed me, speechless, then, shrugging his shoulders,\r\nhe remarked: \"Oh, la guerre, il ne faut pas même y penser\" (\"Oh,\r\nwar, one must not even think about it\"). The officer had merely\r\nexpressed the general opinion of the Russian intelligentsia and social\r\ncircles. As far back as my first visit to St. Petersburg, in the early\r\n'eighties, a grand duchess said to me at dinner, quite calmly: \"Here we\r\nsit all the time on a volcano. We expect the revolution any day! The\r\nSlavs are not faithful, they are not at all monarchical, all of them\r\nare republicans at heart; they disguise their sentiments, and they lie,\r\nevery one of them, all the time.\"\r\n\r\nThree important events, related to foreign politics, came within the\r\nperiod of Prince Hohenlohe's incumbency of the Chancellorship: the\r\nopening, in 1895, of the Emperor William Canal (North Sea-Baltic\r\nCanal), begun under Emperor William the Great, to which squadrons\r\nor individual ships representing countries all over the world were\r\ninvited; the annexation, in 1897, of Tsing-tao; and, third, the\r\nmuch-discussed Kruger dispatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEIZURE OF TSING-TAO\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe played an especially important rôle in the annexation\r\nof Tsing-tao. He, too, was of the opinion that Germany needed some\r\ncoaling stations for her ships, and that the demands of commercial\r\nelements that the opportunity for opening up China to international\r\ntrade be not allowed to pass were justified. It was resolved that,\r\nunder unimpaired Chinese sovereignty and after payment of the likin\r\n(octroi, or internal revenue tax), a trading port, with a marine\r\ncoaling station as protection, was to be founded, wherein it was\r\ncontemplated to allow China to co-operate to the utmost possible extent.\r\n\r\nThe station was to serve the ends of commerce, before all else, the\r\nmilitary measures being limited solely to the protection of the trading\r\ncenter as it developed; they did not constitute an end in themselves or\r\na basis for further military enterprises.\r\n\r\nAlready several places had been considered, but these had proved,\r\nupon more careful investigation, to be unfitted, mostly because they\r\nhad either bad connections or none at all with the interior regions,\r\nwere not promising from a commercial-political standpoint, or were\r\nencumbered by privileges already granted to other foreign countries.\r\nFinally it was agreed--because of the reports of Admiral Tirpitz,\r\nwho was, at that time, chief of the East Asiatic cruiser squadron,\r\nand because of the opinion of the geographical expert, Freiherr von\r\nRichthofen, who, having been questioned on the subject, had drawn\r\na most promising picture of the possibilities of development in\r\nShantung--to found a settlement on the bay of Kiao-Chau.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor proceeded to collect data on the political questions\r\nwhich arose as a result of this and which must be taken into\r\nconsideration. It was particularly necessary not to interfere with\r\nRussia's designs, nor to disturb her. Further information was obtained,\r\nsome of it from our East Asiatic division; from this source favorable\r\nreports came in as to anchorages and the ice-free nature of the bay\r\nof Kiao-Chau, and as to the prospects, if a port were to be founded\r\nthere. From conversations among the officers of the Russian China\r\ndivision, which had come to our ears in our intercourse with them, it\r\nwas learned that the Russian Admiral, in accordance with orders from\r\nhis Government, had anchored one winter in the bay, but had found it\r\nso desolate and so atrociously lonesome--there were no tea houses\r\nwith Japanese geisha girls, which the Russians deemed absolutely\r\nindispensable to winter quarters--that the Russian squadron would never\r\ngo back there any more.\r\n\r\nIt was also reported that the Russian Admiral had advised his\r\nGovernment most earnestly against prosecuting any further its intention\r\nof founding a settlement on this bay, since there was absolutely no\r\nadvantage to be derived from it. Hence, the Russians had no intention\r\nof gaining a foothold there.\r\n\r\nThis last piece of news arrived at about the same time as the answer\r\nfrom the Russian Foreign Minister, Count Muravieff, sent through the\r\nGerman ambassador, relative to the sounding of Russian opinion, which\r\nhad been made pursuant to instructions from the Chancellor. Muravieff\r\nset forth that Russia, to be sure, had no direct claims, based on\r\ntreaty with China, to the bay, but that she, nevertheless, laid claim\r\nto it on the basis of the \"droit du premier mouillage\" (\"right of first\r\nanchorage\"), since the Russian ships had anchored there before those\r\nof any other fleet. This answer, it will be seen, ran counter to the\r\nreport of our East Asiatic division relative to the statements made by\r\nthe Russian Admiral.\r\n\r\nWhen I, with Hollmann, met the Chancellor, in order to discuss the\r\nRussian claim to Kiao-Chau, the Prince listened to the reading of\r\nit with his little ironical smile, and remarked that he had been\r\nunable to find any jurist at the Foreign Office who could tell him\r\nanything about this wonderful claim. Was the navy in a position to\r\ndo so? Admiral Hollmann declared that he, in all his experience on\r\nforeign service, had never heard of it; that it was nonsense and an\r\ninvention of Muravieff, whose only motive was unwillingness to have\r\nsome other nation settle on the shores of the bay. I advised that\r\nPrivy Councilor of the Admiralty Perels, one of the most famous living\r\nexperts on international maritime law and an acknowledged authority in\r\nthis domain, be asked to deliver an opinion, in order to clarify the\r\nquestion. This was done. The opinion tore Muravieff's contention to\r\npieces, corroborated that of Hollmann, and completely did away with the\r\nlegend about the \"right of first anchorage.\"\r\n\r\nMonths elapsed; my August, 1897, visit to Peterhof was imminent. In\r\nagreement with the Prince, my uncle, I decided to discuss the entire\r\nmatter in person and frankly with the Tsar, and, if possible, put an\r\nend to Muravieff's notes and evasions. The talk took place at Peterhof.\r\nThe Tsar stated that he had no interest in the territory south of the\r\nTientsin-Peking line, which meant that there was no reason why he\r\nshould place obstacles in our path in Shantung: that his interest was\r\nconcentrated upon the territory on the Yalu, around Port Arthur, etc.,\r\nnow that the English had made difficulties for him at Mokpo; that he\r\nwould, in fact, be pleased if Germany should locate herself in future\r\non the other side of the Gulf of Chih-li as Russia's welcome neighbor.\r\n\r\nAfterward I had a talk with Muravieff. He employed all his arts,\r\nwriggled back and forth in his statements, and finally brought up his\r\nfamous \"right of first anchorage.\" That was all I wanted. I now passed\r\nto the offensive myself, striking out at him squarely with the opinion\r\ndelivered by Perels. When I had told him, finally, as the Tsar desired,\r\nthe result of the conversations between us two sovereigns, the diplomat\r\nwas even more embarrassed, lost his assumed calm, and capitulated.\r\n\r\nThus was the soil prepared, politically speaking. In the autumn\r\ncame the news from Bishop Anzer of the murder of the two German\r\nCatholic missionaries in Shantung. The entire German Catholic world,\r\nparticularly the \"colonials\" in the Centerist party, demanded energetic\r\nmeasures. The Chancellor proposed to me immediate intervention. While I\r\nwas engaged in the winter hunting at Lotalingen, I consulted with him,\r\nin one of the little towers of the castle there, as to what steps were\r\nto be taken. The Prince proposed to intrust Prince Henry of Prussia,\r\nwho was present, with the command of the squadron that was to be sent\r\nout to reinforce the East Asiatic Division. I informed my brother\r\nof this in the presence of the Chancellor, whereat the Prince and\r\nthe other gentlemen present were highly pleased. The Chancellor sent\r\nthe news to the Foreign Office and to the new Secretary of State for\r\nForeign Affairs, Herr von Bülow, who was away on a journey.\r\n\r\nKiao-Chau was occupied in November, 1897. In December of that year\r\nPrince Henry sailed, on board the _Deutschland_, with his squadron to\r\nEastern Asia, where he later took over the command of the entire East\r\nAsiatic Division. On the 6th of March, 1898, the agreement with China\r\nconcerning Kiao-Chau was signed. At the same time, Mr. Chamberlain\r\nin London brought up before the Japanese ambassador, Baron Kato, the\r\nidea of the conclusion of an Anglo-Japanese alliance, in order to bar\r\nRussia's advance in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEST FOR COALING STATIONS\r\n\r\nOne will naturally inquire why, in the discussion of our audacious\r\nmove, there is no mention of England, since she was certainly deeply\r\ninterested therein. Preliminaries, however, had already been gone\r\ninto with England. In order to meet the necessity for German coaling\r\nstations, I had intended to found, lease, or buy some in agreement\r\nwith England, so far as might be possible. In view of the fact that\r\nmy uncle, the Chancellor, was, as a member of the Hohenlohe family,\r\nrelated to Queen Victoria, known to her personally for years and\r\nhighly esteemed by her, I hoped that this might tend to facilitate the\r\nnegotiations which were entered into with the English Government for\r\nthe above-noted purpose. My hope was disappointed. The negotiations\r\ndragged along without any prospect of successful termination.\r\n\r\nI took occasion, therefore, at the behest of the Chancellor, to discuss\r\nthe matter with the English ambassador at Berlin. I complained of\r\nthe treatment received from the English Government, which everywhere\r\nopposed German wishes, even such as were justified. The ambassador\r\nagreed frankly with this, and expressed his astonishment at England's\r\nfailure to meet Germany halfway, and at English shortsightedness,\r\nsince, when a young, rising nation like Germany, whose development,\r\nafter all, was not to be prevented, turned directly to England in\r\norder to acquire territory with her consent, instead of going straight\r\nahead or allying itself with other nations, it was certainly more than\r\nEngland could reasonably ask.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he added that, since England already owned almost all the\r\nworld, she could certainly find a place where she might permit Germany\r\nto establish a station; that he was unable to understand the gentlemen\r\nin Downing Street; that in case Germany should not succeed in obtaining\r\nEngland's approval, she would probably occupy, on her own account, such\r\nplaces as were suited to her ends, since, after all, there was no law\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nI laid stress upon the fact that this agreed entirely with my own\r\nview and, in conclusion, I summed up my standpoint once more for\r\nthe ambassador: I told him that Germany was the only country in the\r\nworld which, despite its colonial possessions and its rapidly growing\r\ncommerce, possessed no coaling stations; that we were quite willing to\r\nacquire these with England's consent; that, should she refuse to show a\r\nrealization of our situation and fail to meet us halfway, we should be\r\ncompelled to turn to some other great power, in order, with its help,\r\nto found settlements.\r\n\r\nThis talk, likewise, was fruitless. Finally, the negotiations with\r\nEngland were broken off, without result, in a rather impolite manner.\r\nThereupon the Chancellor and I decided to appeal to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Kiao-Chau aroused surprise and anger in the English\r\nGovernment. Having refused us her support, England had definitely\r\nreckoned on the belief that nobody would help Germany in attaining her\r\ngoal. Now things had turned out differently, and there was no lack of\r\nrecriminations from London. When the English ambassador took up this\r\ntone he was referred to the conversation with me, and it was made clear\r\nto him that it was solely the fault of his Government that it had come\r\nto no understanding with Germany.\r\n\r\nEngland's attitude of aloofness surprised us at that time. An\r\noccurrence which, then, was unknown to me, may serve to throw light on\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDS SEED OF WORLD WAR[3]\r\n\r\nIn a book (_The Problem of Japan_) which appeared anonymously at The\r\nHague in 1918 and was said to have been written by an \"Ex-Diplomat from\r\nthe Far East,\" an excerpt was published from a work of the American,\r\nProfessor Usher of Washington University at St. Louis. Usher, like his\r\nformer colleague, Prof. John Bassett Moore of Columbia University,\r\nNew York, has often been called into consultation as an adviser on\r\nforeign relations by the State Department at Washington, since he had a\r\nknowledge possessed by few other Americans on international questions\r\naffecting the United States. Professor Usher, in his book published in\r\n1913, made known, for the first time, the existence and contents of\r\nan \"agreement\" or \"secret treaty\" between _England_, _America_, and\r\n_France_, dating from the spring of 1897. In this it was agreed that,\r\nin case Germany or Austria, or both of them, should begin a war for the\r\nsake of \"Pan-Germanism,\" the United States should at once declare in\r\nfavor of England and France and go to the support of these powers with\r\nall its resources. Professor Usher cites at length all the reasons,\r\nincluding those of a colonial character, which inevitably imposed upon\r\nthe United States the necessity of taking part, on the side of England\r\nand France, in a war against Germany, which Professor Usher, in 1913,\r\nprophesied as _imminent_!!\r\n\r\nThe unknown author of _The Problem of Japan_ went to the trouble of\r\npublishing in tabulated form the agreements between England, France,\r\nand America in 1897, in order thereby to show, in a way easily\r\nunderstood, the extent of the reciprocal obligations. This chapter\r\nis extraordinarily worth reading; it gives a good glimpse into the\r\npreliminary history and _preparation of the World War_ on the part of\r\nthe _Entente_, which even at that time was uniting _against Germany_,\r\nalthough not yet appearing under the name of Entente Cordiale. The\r\nex-diplomat remarks in this connection:\r\n\r\n    Here is a treaty that Professor Usher alleges to have been entered\r\n    into as long ago as 1897, in which every phase of activity and\r\n    participation in future events by England, France, and the United\r\n    States is provided for, including the conquest of the Spanish\r\n    dependencies, control over Mexico and Central America, the opening\r\n    of China, and the annexation of coaling stations. And all these\r\n    measures Professor Usher wishes us to believe were taken to defend\r\n    the world against Pan-Germanism.\r\n\r\n    It is unnecessary to remind Professor Usher, or anybody else, for\r\n    that matter, that Pan-Germanism, if we go so far as to assume that\r\n    such a thing actually exists, had certainly never been heard of\r\n    in 1897, at which time Germany had not yet adopted her program\r\n    for naval construction on a large scale, the same having been\r\n    bruited for the first time in 1898. If, therefore, it is true that\r\n    England, France, and the United States harbored the mutual designs\r\n    imputed to them by Professor Usher, and entered into an alliance to\r\n    accomplish them, it will scarcely do to attribute the conception\r\n    of the idea and the stimulus to its consummation to so feeble a\r\n    pretext as the rise of a Pan-Germanism.[4]\r\n\r\nThus the ex-diplomat.\r\n\r\nThis is truly amazing. A definite treaty of partition directed against\r\nSpain, Germany, etc., arranged even to minute details, was planned\r\nbetween Gauls and Anglo-Saxons, in a time of the profoundest peace,\r\nand concluded without the slightest twinge of conscience, in order to\r\nannihilate Germany and Austria and eliminate their competition from\r\nthe world market! _Seventeen years_ before the beginning of the World\r\nWar _this_ treaty was made by the united Anglo-Saxons and its goal was\r\nsystematically envisaged throughout this entire period! Now one can\r\nunderstand the ease with which King Edward VII could pursue his policy\r\nof encirclement; for years the principal actors had been united and\r\nin readiness. When he christened the compact \"Entente Cordiale,\" its\r\nappearance was for the world, especially for Germany, an unpleasant\r\nnovelty, but in the countries on the other side it was merely the\r\nofficial acknowledgment of facts long known there.\r\n\r\nIn view of this agreement, one can understand also the opposition\r\nof England in 1897 to an agreement with Germany regarding coaling\r\nstations, and the anger aroused because Germany managed, in agreement\r\nwith Russia, to gain a firm foothold in China, concerning the\r\nexploitation of which land _without_ German participation a tripartite\r\ntreaty had already been made.\r\n\r\nUsher talked out of school and conclusively proved _at whose door\r\nlies the guilt for the World War_. The treaty directed against\r\nGermany--sometimes called the \"gentleman's agreement\"--of the spring\r\nof 1897, is the basis, the point of departure, for this war, which was\r\nsystematically developed by the Entente countries for seventeen years.\r\nWhen they had succeeded in winning over Russia and Japan likewise for\r\ntheir purposes, they struck the blow, after Serbia had staged the\r\nSarajevo murder and had thus touched the match to the carefully filled\r\npowder barrel.\r\n\r\nProfessor Usher's statements are likewise a complete refutation of\r\nall those who were impelled, during the war, to find the reason for\r\nthe entry of the United States in certain military acts on the part\r\nof Germany, as, for instance, the _Lusitania_ case, the expansion of\r\nU-boat warfare, etc. None of that is right. The recently published,\r\nexcellent book of John Kenneth Turner, _Shall It Be Again?_ points out,\r\non the basis of convincing proofs, that Wilson's alleged reasons for\r\ngoing to war and war aims were not the real ones. America--or rather\r\nPresident Wilson--was resolved probably from the start, certainly\r\nfrom 1915, to range herself against Germany and to fight. She did the\r\nlatter, alleging the U-boat warfare as a pretext, in reality under the\r\ninfluence of powerful financial groups, and yielding to the pressure\r\nand prayers of her partner, France, whose resources in man power were\r\nbecoming more and more exhausted. America did not wish to leave a\r\nweakened France along with England, whose annexation designs on Calais,\r\nDunkirk, etc., were well known to her.\r\n\r\nIt was a fateful thing for Germany--let this be stated here, in a\r\ngeneral way--that our Foreign Office was unable to meet the broad\r\npolicy of encirclement of England and the cunning of Russia and France\r\nwith an equal degree of diplomatic skill. This was partly because it\r\nhad not really been trained under Prince Bismarck; and therefore\r\nwhen, after the retirement of the Prince and Count Herbert, the\r\nall-dominating will and spirit were lacking, it was not up to the task\r\nof conducting foreign affairs on its own independent initiative.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is difficult in Germany to train up good diplomats, since\r\nour people lack the taste and endowment for diplomacy which have shone\r\nforth brilliantly only from a few German minds, like Frederick the\r\nGreat and Bismarck. Unfavorable also to the Foreign Office were the\r\nvery frequent changes of Secretaries of State. Imperial Chancellors,\r\nfollowing the example of Bismarck, maintained their influence upon the\r\nForeign Office and suggested the Secretaries of State who should direct\r\nits affairs. I acquiesced in the proposals of the Imperial Chancellors\r\nas to these posts, since I admitted their right to choose themselves\r\ntheir leading collaborators in the domain of foreign affairs. That\r\nthese frequent changes were not calculated to work toward the\r\ncontinuity of political policy was a disadvantage that had to be taken\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office was largely influenced by the axiom: \"No\r\ndisagreeable quarrels with other powers\"--\"surtout pas d'histoires\"\r\n(\"above all, no yarns\"), as the French general said to a company of\r\nsoldiers which, he had heard, wished to mutiny. One of the Secretaries\r\nof State told me once when, in placing some matter before me, I had\r\ncalled his attention to the apparently serious situation in connection\r\nwith some foreign question, that this simply must be righted, that the\r\nForeign Office based its acts primarily upon the maxim: \"Let us have\r\nquiet.\"\r\n\r\nGiven this attitude, one can also understand the answer which the\r\nGerman representative gave to a German merchant in a South American\r\nrepublic who had asked him for help and intercession with the\r\nauthorities, since his shop had been plundered and his property\r\nstolen: \"Oh, don't bother me with these things! We have established\r\nsuch pleasant relations with this republic; any action undertaken in\r\nyour behalf would only serve to upset them.\" I need scarcely add that\r\nwhenever such a conception of duty came to my attention I removed the\r\nofficial concerned from his post.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office enjoyed general unpopularity both among the people\r\nand in the army. I worked continuously, during the tenure of office\r\nof various Chancellors, for thorough reform, but in vain. Every new\r\nChancellor, especially if he himself did not come from the ranks of the\r\nforeign service, needed the Foreign Office in order to work himself\r\ninto foreign affairs, and this took time. But once he had worked\r\nhimself in he was under obligation to the officials, and was reluctant\r\nto make extensive changes, burdened as he was by other matters and\r\nlacking detailed knowledge regarding the Foreign Office personnel,\r\nparticularly as he still believed that he needed the advice of those\r\nwho were \"orientated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF TSING-TAO\r\n\r\nBut let us return to Tsing-tao. Here everything was done to promote\r\ncommerce and industry, and done jointly with the Chinese; the flag\r\nof the Chinese Empire, moreover, was hoisted over the Custom House at\r\nTsing-tao. The development there was such that the port, during the\r\nyears immediately preceding the war, ranked sixth among all Chinese\r\ntrading centers in the commercial register of the great Chinese\r\nmerchants and of the merchants' guild coming just after Tientsin.\r\nTsing-tao was a prospering German commercial colony, where many Chinese\r\nworked side by side with Germans; it was, so to speak, a great sample\r\nwarehouse of German abilities and German achievements, to which the\r\nChinese, who formerly had not known Germany, her capabilities of\r\nachievement, or her products, could repair for selection and emulation;\r\nit was a contrast to the naval stations of Russia and England, which\r\nwere purely military, directed solely toward domination and conquest.\r\n\r\nThe rapid rise of Tsing-tao as a trading center aroused the envy of the\r\nJapanese and English, but this did not prevent swarms of the latter\r\nfrom journeying, with their families, to the splendid beach, enjoying\r\nits cool air and the beautiful Strand Hotel, and devoting themselves\r\nto playing polo and lawn tennis after they had escaped from the heat\r\nof Hongkong, Canton, and Shanghai. Envy prompted England in 1914 to\r\ndemand that Japan should take Tsing-tao, although it was _de facto_\r\nChinese. Japan did this joyfully, promising to return it to China, but\r\nit was not returned until the beginning of 1922, after much pressure,\r\nalthough Japan had agreed with America that she was not to be allowed\r\nto make any territorial changes in China without previous consultation\r\nwith Washington.\r\n\r\nThus a great German cultural work in foreign lands, which stood as a\r\nmodel of the method and manner which a cultured nation should employ\r\nin extending the advantages of its culture to another nation, was\r\nannihilated by English commercial envy. Some day, when Hongkong has\r\ngone the same way, England will repent of her act and bitterly reproach\r\nherself for having abandoned her old maxim, in accordance with which\r\nshe has acted for so many years: \"White men together against colored\r\nmen.\" When once Japan has made a reality out of her watchword, \"Asia\r\nfor the Asiatics,\" and brought China and India under her sway, England\r\nwill cast her eyes about in search of Germany and the German fleet.\r\n\r\nAs to the \"yellow peril,\" I had the following interview with the Tsar\r\nlater, after the Russo-Japanese War, at a meeting between us.\r\n\r\nThe Tsar was, at that time, visibly impressed by the growing power\r\nof Japan and its constant menace to Russia and Europe, and requested\r\nmy opinion concerning this. I answered that if the Russians counted\r\nthemselves among the cultured nations of Europe they must be ready\r\nto rally to the defense of these nations against the \"yellow peril\"\r\nand to fight for and by the side of Europe for their own and Europe's\r\nexistence and culture; but that if the Russians, on the other hand,\r\nconsidered themselves Asiatics they would unite with the \"yellow\r\nperil,\" and, joining forces with it, would assail Europe. The Tsar,\r\nsaid I, must bear this in mind in providing for the defense of his land\r\nand organizing his army.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tsar asked me what course I thought the Russians would take, I\r\nreplied: \"The second.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tsar was outraged and wished to know at once on what I based\r\nthis opinion. I answered that my opinion was based on Russia's\r\nconstruction of railways and on the arraying of the Russian army along\r\nthe Prussian-Austrian frontier. Thereupon the Tsar protested that he\r\nand his house were Europeans, that his country and his Russians would\r\ncertainly cleave to Europe, that he would look upon it as a matter of\r\nhonor to protect Europe from the \"yellow men.\" To this I replied that\r\nif this was the Tsar's attitude he must make his military preparations\r\nconform to it without delay. The Tsar said nothing.\r\n\r\nAt all events, I sought to utilize Tsar Nicholas II's worry at the\r\ngrowing power of Japan to the advantage of Germany and general European\r\nculture. Russia, despite siding with Japan, was the first nation to\r\ncollapse among all those participating in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPROACHES FOR JAPAN\r\n\r\nThe able statesmen of Japan, of whom there are quite a number, must be\r\nin some doubt as to whether they ranged their country on the right side\r\nin the war. Yes, they will perhaps ask themselves whether it would not\r\nhave been more advantageous for Japan to have prevented the World War.\r\nThis would have been within her powers, had she ranged herself firmly\r\nand unequivocally on the side of the Central Powers, from which in\r\nformer times she had learned so willingly and so much.\r\n\r\nHad Japan adopted soon enough such an orientation in her foreign\r\npolicy, and, like Germany, fought by peaceful means for her share in\r\nworld trade and activity, I should have put the \"yellow peril\" away in\r\na corner and joyfully welcomed into the circle of peacefully inclined\r\nnations the progressive Japanese nation, the \"Prussians of the East.\"\r\nNobody regrets more than I that the \"yellow peril\" had not already lost\r\nits meaning when the crisis of 1914 arose. The experience derived from\r\nthe World War may yet bring this about.\r\n\r\nGermany's joint action with France and Russia at Shimonoseki was based\r\nupon Germany's situation in Europe. Wedged in between on-marching\r\nRussia, threatening Prussia's frontier, and France, fortifying her\r\nborders anew with forts and groups of fortresses, confronted with a\r\nfriendship between these two nations resembling an alliance, Berlin\r\nlooked with anxiety into the future. The warlike preparations of the\r\ntwo powers were far ahead of ours, their navies far more modern and\r\npowerful than the German navy, which consisted of a few old ships\r\nalmost without fighting value. Therefore it seemed to us wise to\r\nacquiesce in the suggestion of this strong group, in order that it\r\nmight not--should we decline--turn immediately to England and cause\r\nthe entry of the latter into the combination. This would have meant\r\nthe formation, at that time, of the combination of 1914, which would\r\nhave been a serious matter for Germany. Japan, on the other hand,\r\nwas about to go over anyhow to England, in her sympathies. Moreover,\r\nGermany's making common cause with the Franco-Russian group offered\r\nthe possibility of achieving gradually a more trusting and less\r\nstrained relationship in Europe and of living side by side with our two\r\nneighbors there in more friendliness, as a result of the common policy,\r\nadopted in the Far East. The policy adopted by us at this juncture was\r\nalso consistently based on the maintenance of world peace.\r\n\r\nIn the entire Kiao-Chau question, Prince Hohenlohe, despite his age,\r\nevinced a capacity for sticking steadily to his purpose and a degree of\r\nresolution which must be reckoned as greatly to his credit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in the matter of the Kruger dispatch his prudence and\r\nhis vision, so clear on other occasions, abandoned him: only by so\r\nassuming is his obstinate insistence on the sending of this dispatch\r\nto be understood. The influence of such an energetic and eloquent\r\npersonage as Herr von Marschall, former State Attorney, may have been\r\nso powerful, the siren song of Herr von Holstein so convincing, that\r\nthe Prince yielded to them. In any event, he did his country an ill\r\nturn in this matter, and damaged me seriously both in England and at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KRUGER TELEGRAM[5]\r\n\r\nSince the so-called Kruger dispatch made a big stir and had serious\r\npolitical consequences, I shall tell the story of it in detail.\r\n\r\nThe Jameson raid caused great and increasing excitement in Germany.\r\nThe German nation was outraged at this attempt to overpower a little\r\nnation, which was Dutch--and, hence, Lower Saxon-German in origin--and\r\nto which we were sympathetic because of racial relationship. I was much\r\nworried at this violent excitement, which also seized upon the higher\r\nclasses of society, foreseeing possible complications with England. I\r\nbelieved that there was no way to prevent England from conquering the\r\nBoer countries, should she so desire, although I also was convinced\r\nthat such a conquest would be unjust. But I was unable to overcome the\r\nreigning excitement, and was even harshly judged by my intimates on\r\naccount of the attitude I adopted.\r\n\r\nOne day when I had gone to my uncle, the Imperial Chancellor, for a\r\nconference, at which the Secretary of State for the Navy, Admiral\r\nHollmann, was present, Freiherr Marschall, one of the Secretaries of\r\nState, suddenly appeared in high excitement, with a sheet of paper in\r\nhis hand. He declared that the excitement among the people--in the\r\nReichstag, even--had grown to such proportions that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to give it outward expression, and that this could best be\r\ndone by a telegram to Kruger, a rough draft of which he had in his hand.\r\n\r\nI objected to this, being supported by Admiral Hollmann. At first the\r\nImperial Chancellor remained passive in the debate. In view of the fact\r\nthat I knew how ignorant Freiherr Marschall and the Foreign Office were\r\nof English national psychology, I sought to make clear to Freiherr\r\nMarschall the consequences which such a step would have among the\r\nEnglish; in this, likewise, Admiral Hollmann seconded me. But Marschall\r\nwas not to be dissuaded.\r\n\r\nThen, finally, the Imperial Chancellor took a hand. He remarked that\r\nI, as a constitutional ruler, must not stand out against the national\r\nconsciousness and against my constitutional advisers; otherwise, there\r\nwas danger that the excited attitude of the German people, deeply\r\noutraged in its sense of justice and also in its sympathy for the\r\nDutch, might cause it to break down the barriers and turn against me\r\npersonally. Already, he said, statements were flying about among the\r\npeople; it was being said that the Emperor was, after all, half an\r\nEnglishman, with secret English sympathies; that he was entirely under\r\nthe influence of his grandmother, Queen Victoria; that the dictation\r\nemanating from England must cease once for all; that the Emperor must\r\nbe freed from English tutelage, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAYS HE SIGNED AGAINST HIS WILL\r\n\r\nIn view of all this, he continued, it was his duty as Imperial\r\nChancellor, notwithstanding he admitted the justification of my\r\nobjections, to insist that I sign the telegram in the general political\r\ninterest, and, above all else, in the interest of my relationship to my\r\npeople. He and also Herr von Marschall, he went on, in their capacity\r\nof my constitutional advisers, would assume full responsibility for the\r\ntelegram and its consequences.\r\n\r\nSir Valentine Chirol, at that time correspondent of the _Times_,\r\nwrote, in the _Times_ of September 11th, that Herr von Marschall,\r\ndirectly after the sending of the dispatch, had stated to him that the\r\ndispatch did not give the personal opinion of the Emperor, but was a\r\ngovernmental act, for which the Chancellor and he himself assumed full\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Hollmann, when the Imperial Chancellor appealed to him for\r\ncorroboration of this point of view and was asked by him to uphold it\r\nto me, declined to do so with the remark that the Anglo-Saxon world\r\nwould unquestionably attribute the telegram to the Kaiser, since\r\nnobody would believe that such a provocative thing could come from His\r\nMajesty's elderly advisers, and all would consider it an \"impulsive\"\r\nact of the \"youthful\" Emperor.\r\n\r\nThen I again tried to dissuade the gentlemen from their project. But\r\nthe Imperial Chancellor and Marschall insisted that I sign, reiterating\r\nthat they would be responsible for consequences. It seemed to me that I\r\nought not to refuse after their presentation of the case. I signed.\r\n\r\nNot long before his death Admiral Hollmann recalled the occurrence to\r\nme in full detail, as it is described here.\r\n\r\nAfter the Kruger dispatch was made public the storm broke in England,\r\nas I had prophesied. I received from all circles of English society,\r\nespecially from aristocratic ladies unknown to me, a veritable flood of\r\nletters containing every possible kind of reproach, some of the writers\r\nnot hesitating even at slandering me personally and insulting me.\r\nAttacks and calumnies began to appear in the press, so that soon the\r\nlegend of the origin of the dispatch was as firmly established as the\r\namen at church. If Marschall had also announced in the Reichstag what\r\nhe stated to Chirol, I personally would not have been drawn into the\r\nmatter to such an extent.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1900, while the Boer War was in progress and while I was\r\nwith the fleet at Heligoland attending the maneuvers of ships of the\r\nline, after having been present at the swearing in of recruits at\r\nWilhelmshafen I received news by telegraph from the Wilhelmstrasse,\r\n_via_ Heligoland, that Russia and France had proposed to Germany to\r\nmake a joint attack on England, now that she was involved elsewhere,\r\nand cripple her sea traffic. I objected and ordered that the proposal\r\nbe declined.\r\n\r\nSince I assumed that Paris and St. Petersburg would present the matter\r\nat London in such a way as to make it appear that Berlin had made\r\nthe above proposal to both of them, I immediately telegraphed from\r\nHeligoland to Queen Victoria and to the Prince of Wales (Edward) the\r\nfact of the Russo-French proposal, and its refusal by me. The Queen\r\nanswered expressing her hearty thanks, the Prince of Wales with an\r\nexpression of astonishment.\r\n\r\nLater, Her Majesty let me know secretly that, shortly before the\r\nreceipt of my telegram from Heligoland concerning the proposal from\r\nParis and St. Petersburg, the false version of the matter foreseen\r\nby me had indeed been told, and that she was glad to have been able,\r\nthanks to my dispatch, to expose the intrigue to her Government and\r\nquiet it as to the loyal attitude of Germany; she added that she would\r\nnot forget the service I had done England in troublous times.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAL WITH CECIL RHODES\r\n\r\nWhen Cecil Rhodes came to me, in order to bring about the construction\r\nof the Cape-to-Cairo Railway and Telegraph line through the interior\r\nregions of German East Africa, his wishes were approved by me, in\r\nagreement with the Foreign Office and the Imperial Chancellor; with\r\nthe proviso that a branch railway should be built _via_ Tabora, and\r\nthat German material should be used in the construction work on German\r\nterritory. Both conditions were acquiesced in by Rhodes most willingly.\r\nHe was grateful at the fulfillment of his pet ambition by Germany, only\r\na short time after King Leopold of Belgium had refused his request.\r\n\r\nRhodes was full of admiration for Berlin and the tremendous German\r\nindustrial plants, which he visited daily. He said that he regretted\r\nnot having been in Berlin before, in order to have learned about the\r\npower and efficiency of Germany, and to have got into touch with the\r\nGerman Government and prominent Germans in commercial circles. He said\r\nhe had wished, even before the Jameson raid, to visit Berlin, but had\r\nbeen prevented in London at that time from so doing; that, had he been\r\nable to inform us before of his plan to get permission to build the\r\nCape-to-Cairo line through the Boer countries, as well as through our\r\ncolonies, the German Government would probably have been able to help\r\nhim by bringing persuasion to bear upon Kruger, who was unwilling to\r\ngrant this permission; that \"the stupid Jameson Raid\" would never have\r\nbeen made, in that case, and the Kruger dispatch never written--as to\r\nthat dispatch, he had never borne me a grudge on account of it.\r\n\r\nHe added that as we, in Germany, could not be correctly informed as\r\nto aim and actual purposes, the said raid must have looked to us like\r\n\"an act of piracy,\" which naturally and quite rightly had excited the\r\nGermans; that all he had wanted was to have such stretches of land as\r\nwere needed for his rail lines--such, in fact, as Germany had just\r\ngranted to him in the interior of her colonies--a demand which was not\r\nunjust and would certainly have met with German support. I was not to\r\nworry, he added, about the dispatch and not bother myself any more\r\nabout the uproar in the English press. Rhodes did not know about the\r\norigin of the Kruger dispatch and wanted to console me, imagining that\r\nI was its originator.\r\n\r\nRhodes went on to advise me to build the Bagdad Railway and open up\r\nMesopotamia, after having had irrigation simultaneously introduced\r\nthere. He said that this was Germany's task, just as his was the\r\nCape-to-Cairo line. In view of the fact that the building of this line\r\nthrough our territory was also made dependent upon the cession to us of\r\nthe Samoan Islands, Rhodes worked actively in London toward having them\r\nturned over to us.\r\n\r\nIn home politics, Prince Hohenlohe, as Chancellor, showed a mildness\r\nwhich was not generally favorable. Owing to his long acquaintanceship\r\nwith Herr von Hertling, he was able to establish friendly relations\r\nwith the Vatican. His mildness and indulgence were also exercised\r\ntoward Alsace-Lorraine, in which, as an expert of long standing,\r\nhe showed particular interest. But he got little thanks for this,\r\nsince the French element, indirectly benefited thereby, behaved with\r\never-increasing arrogance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEN SKETCH OF HOHENLOHE\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe loved to employ mediation, compromise, and\r\nconciliation--toward the Socialists likewise--and he employed them on\r\nsome occasions when energetic measures would have been more fitting. He\r\nhailed with much joy my Far East trip to Constantinople and Jerusalem.\r\nHe was pleased at the strengthening of our relations with Turkey and\r\nconsidered the plan for the Bagdad Railway arising from them as a great\r\ncultural work worthy of Germany.\r\n\r\nHe also gave his most enthusiastic approval to my visit to England in\r\n1899, made by me with my wife and two sons at the desire of my royal\r\ngrandmother, who, growing steadily weaker on account of her years,\r\nwished to see her oldest grandson once more. He hoped that this journey\r\nmight serve to efface somewhat the consequences of the Kruger dispatch\r\nsent by him, and also to clarify some important questions by means of\r\nconferences between me and English statesmen.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid any unpleasantness from the English press, which,\r\nangered by the Boer War and the partly unjustified attacks of certain\r\nGerman newspapers, had been answering in like tone, the Queen had\r\ncommissioned the author of _The Life of the Prince Consort_, Sir\r\nTheodore Martin, to inform the English press of Her Majesty's desire\r\nthat a friendly reception be accorded to her Imperial grandson. And\r\nthat is what indeed came to pass. The visit ran its course harmoniously\r\nand caused satisfaction on all sides. I held important conferences with\r\nvarious leading men.\r\n\r\nNot once in the entire visit was the Kruger dispatch mentioned.\r\nOn the other hand, my royal grandmother did not conceal from her\r\ngrandson how unwelcome the whole Boer War was to her; she made no\r\nsecret of her disapproval and aversion for Mr. Chamberlain and all\r\nthat he represented, and thanked me again for my prompt and sharp\r\nrefusal of the Russo-French proposal to interfere and for my immediate\r\nannouncement of this proposal. One could easily see how much the Queen\r\nloved her splendid army and how deeply she had been grieved by the\r\nheavy reverses suffered by it at the outset of the war, which had\r\ncaused by no means negligible losses. Referring to these, the aged\r\nField Marshal Duke of Cambridge coined the fine phrase: \"The British\r\nnobleman and officer have shown that they can die bravely as gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nOn my departure, the Queen bade me farewell with cordial and grateful\r\ngreetings to her \"much-cherished cousin,\" the Imperial Chancellor,\r\nwhose ability and experience, she hoped, would continue to maintain\r\ngood relations between our two countries.\r\n\r\nMy report entirely satisfied Prince Hohenlohe as to the success of\r\nmy journey; at the same time, however, I was the object of the most\r\nviolent attacks from a certain section of the press and from many\r\nexcited \"friends of the Boers.\" The German lacks the very thing with\r\nwhich the English people has been inoculated, and to which it has\r\nbeen trained by long political self-discipline: when a fight is on,\r\neven though it be merely upon the field of diplomacy, the Englishman\r\nunquestioningly follows the flag, in accordance with the proverb: \"You\r\ncan't change the jockey while running.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1900 Prince Hohenlohe retired from the Chancellorship,\r\nsince the work had become too arduous for a man of his advanced age.\r\nMoreover, the constant quarrels and disputes of the political parties\r\nwith one another were disagreeable to him, and it went against the\r\ngrain with him to make speeches before them in the Reichstag. Equally\r\ndisagreeable to him was the press, part of which had taken the bit\r\nbetween its teeth and imagined that it could conserve the Bismarckian\r\ntradition by quoting sayings by Bismarck, and had greatly jeopardized\r\nrelations with England, especially during the Boer War.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR'S RETIREMENT\r\n\r\nThe hope, aroused by the choice of Prince Hohenlohe as Chancellor and\r\nhis assumption of the office, that Prince Bismarck would place less\r\nobstacles in his path, had been only partly fulfilled. The atmosphere\r\nhad been much relieved and Prince Bismarck brought to a much milder\r\nframe of mind by my reconciliation with him, which had received\r\noutward expression in his solemn entry into Berlin and his staying\r\nat the old Hohenzollern palace, but his adherents and those rallying\r\naround him for the sake of opposition were not to be dissuaded from\r\ntheir activities. Moreover, the political representatives of the\r\npeople succeeded, while I was on my way to Friedrichsruh to celebrate\r\nBismarck's eightieth birthday, in refusing to pay homage to the old\r\nImperial Chancellor, a thing which naturally deeply hurt the sensitive\r\nPrince Hohenlohe and filled him with indignation.\r\n\r\nHe, like myself, was deeply moved by the death of his great\r\npredecessor, and we, together with the German people, sincerely mourned\r\nPrince Bismarck as one of the greatest of the sons of Prussia and\r\nGermany, in spite of the fact that he had not always made our task\r\neasy. I insisted upon hurrying back from my trip to Norway in order\r\nto pay honor to him who, as a faithful servant of his old master, had\r\nhelped the German nation to unity, and under whom I, when I was Prince,\r\nhad had the proud privilege of working.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one of the reasons why Prince Hohenlohe retired from\r\nhis post was the advice of his son Alexander, who was much at his\r\nfather's house; he was known in society as \"the Crown Prince,\" and was\r\nessentially different from his lovable father.\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe could look back upon a series of successes during\r\nhis term as Chancellor: the overcoming of the disputes concerning\r\nthe \"Citizens' Book of Laws,\" the reform of the military punishment\r\nprocedure, the Naval law, the appointment of Waldersee to the command\r\nin China at the time of the Boxer War, Tsing-tao, and the Yangtse\r\nTreaty.\r\n\r\nHe bade me farewell on the 15th of October, 1900. Both of us were\r\ngreatly moved, for not only was the Chancellor and faithful co-worker\r\nparting from his Emperor, but also the uncle from his nephew,\r\nwho looked up with grateful esteem to the old man. At the age of\r\nseventy-five years--an age when others have long since retired to rest\r\nand contemplation--he had not hesitated to obey the summons of the\r\nEmperor to subject himself to even more exacting labors and devote his\r\ntime and strength to the German fatherland. When about to leave my\r\nroom, he grasped my hand once again with the request that I might grant\r\nhim, during the years of life still remaining to him (which he meant\r\nto spend in Berlin), the same plain, faithful friendship which he had\r\nso long noted and admired between me and Admiral von Hollmann. I shall\r\nalways preserve him faithfully in my memory.\r\n\r\n  [3] \"Once the magnitude of Pan-Germanism dawned on the English and\r\n      French diplomats, once they became aware of the lengths to\r\n      which Germany was willing to go, they realized the necessity of\r\n      strengthening their position, and therefore made overtures to the\r\n      United States, which resulted, probably before the summer of the\r\n      year 1897, in an understanding between the three countries. There\r\n      seems to be no doubt whatever that no papers of any sort were\r\n      signed, that no pledges were given which circumstances would not\r\n      justify any one of the contracting parties in denying or possibly\r\n      repudiating. Nevertheless, an understanding was reached that in\r\n      case of a war begun by Germany or Austria for the purpose of\r\n      executing Pan-Germanism, the United States would promptly declare\r\n      in favor of England and France and would do her utmost to assist\r\n      them.\"--ROLAND G.

Langenhuysen,\r\n      Amsterdam and Rotterdam. 1918.\r\n\r\n  [5] Tremendous excitement was caused in England when the incident of\r\n      the Kruger message became known. On January 3, 1896, the German\r\n      Emperor telegraphed as follows to the President of the South\r\n      African Republic:\r\n\r\n      \"I congratulate you most sincerely on having succeeded, with\r\n      your people, without calling on the help of foreign powers,\r\n      by opposing your own force to an armed band which broke into\r\n      your country to disturb the peace, in restoring quiet and in\r\n      maintaining the independence of your country against external\r\n      attack.\"\r\n\r\n      On January 6th, in conversation with Sir Frank Lascelles,\r\n      Baron von Marschall protested against the view of the English\r\n      press that it was an act of hostility against England and\r\n      an encroachment on English rights for the German Emperor to\r\n      congratulate the head of a friendly state on his victory over an\r\n      armed band that had invaded his land in defiance of international\r\n      law, and had been declared to be outside the pale of the law by\r\n      the English Government itself. But it was not recorded that he\r\n      disavowed the Kaiser's responsibility for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBülow\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after Prince Hohenlohe's farewell, the man summoned by me\r\nas his successor--Count Bülow, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,\r\narrived. His choice for the post was eminently fitting, because he was\r\nthoroughly cognizant of our foreign policy and, especially, of our\r\nrelations with England--which policy was becoming constantly livelier\r\nand more complicated--and because he had already proved himself a\r\nskillful orator and ready debater in the Reichstag. The fact that\r\nthe second of these qualities was lacking in his predecessor had\r\noften been painfully noticeable. When Prince Hohenlohe's intention to\r\nretire became known in the Imperial Council, the Bavarian ambassador\r\nat Berlin, Count Lerchenfeld, very pointedly remarked to me that for\r\nHeaven's sake I was not to choose another South German, since South\r\nGermans were not fitted for the leading post at Berlin; North Germans\r\nwere naturally better able to fill it and, therefore, it would be\r\nbetter for the Empire to select a North German.\r\n\r\nI had been acquainted personally with Bülow for a long time, ever\r\nsince the period of his ambassadorship at Rome and his work as\r\nSecretary of State. Then I had often visited him at his home and had\r\nheld many a conference with him in his garden. He came into closer\r\nrelationship with me when he accompanied me on my journey to the Far\r\nEast, where, in co-operation with the ambassador, Freiherr Marschall,\r\nhe assisted me in getting into personal touch with the leading men of\r\nthe Turkish Government. Hence, the relations of the new Chancellor with\r\nme were already begun and, to a certain extent, established, since we\r\nhad for years discussed all political problems and spheres. Moreover,\r\nhe stood much nearer to me in age than his predecessors, most of whom\r\ncould have been my grandfather. He was the first \"young Chancellor\" of\r\nGermany. And this made our common task easier for both of us.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Berlin, scarcely a day went by without my taking a\r\nlong morning walk with the Chancellor in the garden of the Imperial\r\nChancellor's palace, during which outstanding business was cleared up\r\nand problems of actuality discussed. I often had a meal with him and\r\nalways found at his table, where I was most hospitably received by the\r\nCount, his amiable wife and a group of the most interesting men, in\r\nchoosing whom the Count was a master. He was likewise unsurpassed in\r\nskillfully conducting conversation and in the witty handling of the\r\nvarious topics that arose. To me it was always a pleasure to be in the\r\ncompany of the Chancellor and enjoy his bubbling wit, to exchange\r\nviews at his table with many professors, savants, and artists, as\r\nwell as Government officials of all sorts, in informal, unofficial\r\nintercourse and stimulating exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Count was an excellent narrator of anecdotes, drawn both from books\r\nand his own personal experience, which he told in several languages. He\r\nliked to tell stories of the days when he was a diplomat, especially\r\nabout his stay at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nBÜLOW A DISCIPLE OF BISMARCK\r\n\r\nThe Count's father was an intimate friend of Prince Bismarck and\r\nhad been one of his closest co-workers. Young Bülow also had begun\r\nhis career under the great Chancellor; he had been brought up on\r\nBismarckian ideas and traditions and strongly influenced by them, but,\r\nnevertheless, had not adhered to them to such an extent as to lose his\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIn the course of one of the first talks which I had with Bülow as\r\nImperial Chancellor he informed himself concerning my ideas of how best\r\nto handle the English and have dealings with them. I told him that I\r\nconsidered absolute frankness the most important thing in dealing with\r\nEngland and Englishmen; that the Englishman, in presenting his point of\r\nview and working for his interests, was inconsiderate to the point of\r\nbrutality, for which reason he thoroughly understood anybody who acted\r\nsimilarly toward him; that there must be no playing the diplomatic\r\ngame, or \"finessing,\" with an Englishman, because it made him distrust\r\nthose with whom he was dealing and suspect that they were not honest\r\nand wished secretly to cheat him; that such devious methods could be\r\nsuccessful only in dealing with Latin and Slavic nations; that, once\r\nthe Englishman had become suspicious, there was nothing more to be done\r\nwith him, despite the most honeyed words and most obliging concessions;\r\nthat the only advice, therefore, which I could give the Chancellor was\r\nthat he confine himself entirely to straightforwardness in his English\r\npolicy. I said this with particular emphasis, since \"finessing\" was\r\nespecially dear to the diplomatic character of Count Bülow and had\r\nbecome second nature to him.\r\n\r\nI also took occasion, during this talk, to warn the Chancellor against\r\nHolstein. In spite of my warning--which was merely a repetition of\r\nthat given me before by Bismarck--Bülow worked a great deal, or was\r\nobliged to work, with Holstein. This remarkable man had been able\r\ngradually, especially since the time that the Foreign Office had been,\r\nso to speak, orphaned by Bismarck's retirement, to create for himself a\r\nposition that became steadily more influential and to maintain it under\r\nthree Chancellors with such skill that he was considered indispensable.\r\n\r\nHolstein was unquestionably possessed of great shrewdness, seconded by\r\na phenomenal memory and a certain talent for political combinations,\r\nwhich, to be sure, often became a hobby in his case. His position\r\nwas also based largely on the fact that he was looked upon in many\r\nquarters, especially among the older officials, as the \"bearer of\r\nthe Bismarckian traditions,\" the man who upheld these in the teeth\r\nof \"the young master.\" His importance rested, above all, on his wide\r\npersonal knowledge in the entire domain of the foreign service. Since\r\nhe wielded, on account of this, an authoritative influence on all\r\nproposals relative to the appointment of officials and hence, also, on\r\nthe careers of the younger officials, it may be easily understood why\r\nhe, little by little, had obtained for himself a dominating position at\r\nthe Foreign Office. But he sought more and more to obtain, at the same\r\ntime, a decisive influence upon the conduct of foreign policy; he had,\r\nin fact, become the guiding spirit both of the Foreign Office and of\r\nGerman foreign policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLSTEIN'S SECRET POWER\r\n\r\nThe serious thing about this was that he exerted his far-reaching\r\ninfluence entirely from under cover and avoided all official\r\nresponsibility as an adviser. He preferred to remain in the dark and\r\nexert his influence from there. He refused every responsible post--many\r\nstood open to him--every honorary title, every promotion. He lived\r\nin complete seclusion. For a long time I tried in vain to become\r\npersonally acquainted with him, for which purpose I used to invite him\r\nto meals, but Holstein declined every time. Only once, in the course\r\nof many years, did he consent to dine with me at the Foreign Office,\r\nand it was characteristic of him that, whereas on this occasion all\r\nthe other gentlemen present wore full evening dress, he appeared in a\r\nfrock coat and excused himself on the plea that he had no dress coat.\r\n\r\nThe secrecy with which he surrounded himself in his work, so as not\r\nto be held responsible for it, became apparent also at times in the\r\ncharacter of the memorials drawn up by him; they were unquestionably\r\ningenious and attractive, but often as involved and ambiguous as the\r\noracle of Delphi; there were occasions when, after a decision had been\r\nmade based on the contents of one of these documents, Herr von Holstein\r\nwould prove to a nicety that he meant exactly the opposite of what had\r\nbeen thought.\r\n\r\nI considered it a serious matter that an irresponsible counselor should\r\nbring to bear such powerful influence, especially as he did so from\r\nunder cover and, hence, in doing it, eluded the officials who were in\r\nduty bound to exert influence, and who were the responsible parties.\r\nOften, especially in the von Richthofen era, it happened that I would\r\nadvise a foreign ambassador to discuss some political question, which\r\nhe had taken up with me, with the Secretary of State, and he would\r\nreply: \"J'en parlerai avec mon ami Holstein\" (\"I shall speak about\r\nit with my friend Holstein\"). The fact alone that an official of the\r\nForeign Office dealt with foreign ambassadors, going over the head of\r\nhis superior, did not seem right to me; but that he should be dubbed\r\nby these foreigners \"friend\" seemed to me to go beyond what I deemed\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nMatters had, in fact, developed gradually to such a stage that Holstein\r\nconducted a good part of our foreign affairs. To be sure, he still\r\nlistened to the Chancellor in connection with them, but what the\r\nEmperor thought or said about foreign affairs was rather unimportant.\r\nIf things turned out successfully, the Foreign Office reaped the\r\nreward; if things went wrong, then it was the fault of the \"impulsive\r\nyoung master.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, Bülow, too, apparently thought Herr von Holstein\r\nindispensable at first; he worked together with him for a long time,\r\nuntil at last he, too, found unbearable the pressure which this strange\r\nman exerted on everybody. To Herr von Tschirschky, during his tenure\r\nof office as Secretary of State, belongs the merit of finally bringing\r\nthe unendurable situation to a head. On being questioned by me, he\r\ndeclared that he considered it impossible that Herr von Holstein remain\r\nat his post any longer, since he was embroiling the whole Foreign\r\nOffice, seeking to eliminate him, the Secretary of State, entirely, and\r\ncreating all kinds of obstacles, likewise, for the Chancellor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISMISSAL--AND AN ENEMY\r\n\r\nThereupon I ordered Herr von Tschirschky to prepare the way for the\r\ndismissal of Herr von Holstein, which afterward took place, with the\r\napproval of the Chancellor, after the latter had recovered from the\r\nserious break-down in health which he had suffered meanwhile. Herr von\r\nHolstein himself showed what manner of man he was by going at once\r\nafter his dismissal to Herr Harden and placing himself at the latter's\r\ndisposal for the campaign against the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe year 1901 gave Count Bülow plentiful opportunities to show and\r\nassert himself in dealings with England. Count Bülow still believed\r\nstrongly in the Bismarckian theory of having \"two irons in the\r\nfire\"--_i. e._, in making friendly agreements with another country\r\nwhile always remaining on good terms with Russia--in which he received\r\nsupport from the many pretended adherents of Bismarck.\r\n\r\nFrom the midst of the Jubilee celebration of the two hundredth\r\ncoronation anniversary, I was called to the deathbed of my grandmother,\r\nQueen Victoria, by a dispatch announcing to me the serious condition\r\nof the Queen. I hurriedly made the journey with my uncle, the Duke\r\nof Connaught, who was at Berlin as the Queen's representative at the\r\nfestivities--he was the favorite son of the Queen and my particular\r\nfriend, and a son-in-law of Prince Frederick Charles--and I was\r\ncordially received in London by the then Prince of Wales and the royal\r\nfamily. As my carriage drove out at a trot from the railway station\r\na plainly dressed man stepped forward from the closely packed crowd\r\nstanding there in absolute silence, to the side of the carriage, bared\r\nhis head, and said: \"Thank you, Kaiser.\" The Prince of Wales, later\r\nEdward VII, added: \"That is what they all think, and they will never\r\nforget this coming of yours.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they did forget it, and quickly.\r\n\r\nAfter the Queen had quietly breathed her last in my arms, the curtain\r\nfell for me upon many memories of childhood. Her death signified the\r\nclose of an epoch in English history and in Germany's relations with\r\nEngland. I now got into touch, as far as possible, with prominent\r\npersonages, and noted everywhere a thoroughly sympathetic, friendly\r\nspirit, which made no secret of the wish for good relations with\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nAt the farewell banquet impromptu speeches were made by King Edward\r\nVII and myself, which were cordial in tone and content, and did not\r\nfail to make an impression on their hearers. After the meal the English\r\nambassador at Berlin clasped my hand and said that my speech had\r\ntouched all his fellow countrymen's hearts, because what I said was\r\nsincere and simple, as was fitting for Englishmen; that the speech\r\nmust at once be made public, since it would have an effect throughout\r\nthe country, which was grateful for my coming; and that this would be\r\nuseful to the relations between the two countries. I answered that it\r\nwas a matter for the British Government and the King to decide, that\r\npersonally I had no objections to having the speech made public.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was not made public, and the British people never\r\nlearned of my words, which were the sincere expression of my sentiments\r\nand thoughts. In another talk later on with me at Berlin the same\r\nambassador deeply regretted this, but was unable to say what the reason\r\nwas for this omission.\r\n\r\nIn concluding my remarks on my stay in England I cannot pass over the\r\nfact that a portion of the German press was unfortunately lacking both\r\nin tactful appreciation of the grief of the English royal family and\r\npeople, as well as of the obligations which my family relationship and\r\npolitical considerations imposed upon me.\r\n\r\nAfter my return home from England I was able to report to the\r\nChancellor on the good impressions I had received, and particularly\r\nthat opinion in England was apparently in favor of an understanding and\r\nof closer relations.\r\n\r\nBülow expressed himself as satisfied with the results of the journey,\r\nafter we had talked at length about it at Homburg, and consulted as\r\nto how the situation created by the journey should be put to use. I\r\nsuggested that we should unquestionably come to a good agreement, if an\r\nalliance--which I preferred--could not be brought about. In any event,\r\na firm agreement would suffice, I said, and would suit the English; in\r\nthe long run an alliance might always develop from it.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for such an alliance came with unexpected promptness.\r\nWhile I was at Homburg von der Höhe in the spring of 1901, Count\r\nMetternich, who was with me as representative of the Foreign Office,\r\nbrought me a notification from Berlin that _Mr. Chamberlain_ had\r\ninquired there as to whether Germany was ready for an _alliance with\r\nEngland_. I immediately asked: \"Against whom?\"--since, if England so\r\nsuddenly offered to make an alliance in the midst of peace, it was\r\nplain that she needed the German army, which made it worth while to\r\nfind out against whom the army was needed and for what reason German\r\ntroops were to fight, at England's behest, by her side. Thereupon the\r\nanswer came from London that they were needed against Russia, since\r\nRussia was a menace both to India and to Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was to call London's attention to the old\r\ntraditional brotherhood-in-arms between the German and Russian armies,\r\nand the close family ties between the reigning dynasties of the two\r\ncountries; in addition, I pointed out the dangers of a war on two\r\nfronts, in case France came in on the side of Russia, and also the\r\nfact that we had acted jointly with France and Russia in the Far East\r\n(Shimonoseki, 1895) and that there was no reason to unloose a conflict\r\nwith Russia at this time, when we were in the midst of peace; that the\r\nsuperiority in number of the Russian army on a peace footing was very\r\ngreat and the eastern frontiers of Prussia seriously threatened by the\r\ngrouping of the Russian forces; that England would not be in a position\r\nto protect our eastern province from a Russian attack, since her fleet\r\ncould accomplish little in the Baltic and would be unable to sail into\r\nthe Black Sea; that, in case of our making common cause against Russia,\r\nGermany would be the only one who would be in great danger, quite\r\nindependently of the possibility of the entry of France into the fight.\r\n\r\nChamberlain then informed us that a firm alliance should be made, by\r\nwhich England would naturally bind herself to come to our aid.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH ALLIANCE FAILS\r\n\r\nI had also pointed out that the validity of an alliance could only\r\nbe assured when the English Parliament had placed its approval upon\r\nit, since the Ministry might be driven from office by the will of the\r\nnation as expressed in Parliament, whereby signature of the Ministry\r\nmight be rendered null and void and the alliance invalidated, and that\r\nwe could look upon the Chamberlain suggestion, for the time being,\r\nmerely as a purely personal project of his own.\r\n\r\nTo this Chamberlain replied that he would get backing from Parliament\r\nin due time and would find the way of winning the Unionists over to\r\nhis idea; that all needed now was the signature of Berlin. Matters\r\ndid not progress as far as that, because Parliament was not to be won\r\nover to Chamberlain's plan; therefore the \"plan\" came to nothing. Soon\r\nafterward England concluded her alliance with Japan (Hayashi). The\r\nRusso-Japanese War broke out, in which Japan--owing to the fact that\r\nit fitted in with her schemes--played the rôle of pawn for England's\r\ninterests, which rôle had originally been reserved for Germany. By\r\nthis war Russia was thrown from the east back to the west, where she\r\nmight concern herself again with the Balkans, Constantinople, and\r\nIndia--which was to Japan's advantage--leaving to Japan a free hand in\r\nKorea and China.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 came my journey to Tangier, undertaken much against my will.\r\nIt came about as follows: Toward the end of March I intended, as in\r\nthe previous year, to take a Mediterranean trip for the sake of my\r\nhealth, for which I proposed to avail myself of some ship running empty\r\nfrom Cuxhaven to Naples. The _Hamburg_ was destined by Ballin for this\r\npurpose. At his request that I take along some other guests, since the\r\nsteamer was quite empty, I invited a number of gentlemen, among them\r\nPrivy Councilor Althoc, Admiral Mensing, Count Pückler, Ambassador von\r\nVarnbuhler, Professor Schiemann, Admiral Hollmann, etc.\r\n\r\nSoon after the proposed trip became known Bülow informed me that\r\nthere was a strong desire at Lisbon to have me stop there and pay the\r\nPortuguese court a visit. To this I agreed. As the date of departure\r\napproached, Bülow expressed the additional wish that I also stop at\r\nTangier and, by visiting that Moroccan port, strengthen the position of\r\nthe Sultan of Morocco in relation to the French.\r\n\r\nThis I declined, since it seemed to me that the Morocco question was\r\ntoo full of explosive matter and I feared that such a visit would\r\nwork out disadvantageously rather than beneficially. Bülow returned\r\nto the attack, without, however, persuading me of the necessity or\r\nadvisability of the visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGAIN KAISER \"GIVES IN\"\r\n\r\nDuring the journey I had several talks with Freiherr von Schoen, who\r\naccompanied me as representative of the Foreign Office, as to the\r\nadvisability of the visit. We agreed that it would be better to drop\r\nit. I telegraphed this decision to the Chancellor from Lisbon. Bülow\r\nreplied emphatically that I must take into consideration the view of\r\nthe German people and of the Reichstag, which had become interested in\r\nthe project, and that it was necessary that I stop at Tangier.\r\n\r\nI gave in, with a heavy heart, for I feared that this visit, in view\r\nof the situation at Paris, might be construed as a provocation and\r\ncause an inclination in London to support France in case of war. Since\r\nI suspected that Delcassé wished to make Morocco a pretext for war, I\r\nfeared that he might make use of the Tangier visit for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe visit took place, after much difficulty had been experienced in the\r\nopen roadstead of Tangier, and it met with a certain amount of friendly\r\nparticipation by Italian and Southern French anarchists, rogues, and\r\nadventurers. A lot of Spaniards stood upon a small square, amid waving\r\nbanners and loud cries; these, according to a police official who\r\naccompanied us, were an assembly of Spanish anarchists.\r\n\r\nThe first I learned about the consequences of my Tangier visit was\r\nwhen I got to Gibraltar and was formally and frigidly received by the\r\nEnglish, in marked contrast to my cordial reception the year before.\r\nWhat I had foreseen was justified by the facts. Embitterment and anger\r\nreigned in Paris, and Delcassé tried to rouse the nation to war; the\r\nonly reason that he did not succeed was that both the Minister of War\r\nand the Minister of the Navy declared France not yet ready.\r\n\r\nThe fact that my fears were justified was also corroborated later by\r\nthe conversation between Delcassé and the editor of _Le Gaulois_,\r\nin which the Minister informed an astonished world that, in case of\r\nwar, England would have sided with France. Thus, even as far back as\r\nthat, I ran the risk, through the Tangier visit forced upon me, of\r\ngetting blamed for the unchaining of a world war. To think and act\r\nconstitutionally is often a hard task for a ruler upon whom in every\r\ncase responsibility is finally saddled.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1905, the Paris _Matin_ reported that Delcassé had declared\r\nin the Council of Ministers that England had offered, in case of war,\r\nto land 100,000 men in Holstein and seize the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal.\r\nThis English offer was repeated once more later on, with the suggestion\r\nthat it be affirmed in writing. And the well-known Jaurès, who was\r\nmurdered in accordance with the political ideas of Isvolsky upon the\r\noutbreak of war in 1914, knew beforehand about the statements by\r\nDelcassé published in the _Matin_.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of Delcassé and the accession of Rouvier to his post are\r\nto be ascribed partly to the influence of the Prince of Monaco. During\r\nthe regatta week at Kiel the Prince had assured himself, by talks with\r\nme, the Imperial Chancellor, and Government officials, of the sincerity\r\nof our desire to compromise with France for the purpose of enabling us\r\nto live at peace with each other. He stood well with the ambassador,\r\nPrince Radolin, and worked actively toward a rapprochement between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Monaco himself was of the opinion that Delcassé was a\r\nmenace to the maintenance of peace and hoped that he would soon fall\r\nand be replaced by Rouvier, who was a prudent politician thoroughly\r\ninclined to coming to an understanding with Germany. The Prince said\r\nthat he was on good terms with Rouvier personally and would willingly\r\nplace himself at the disposal of the German ambassador as a go-between.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGOTIATIONS FRUITLESS\r\n\r\nThen came Delcassé's fall, and Rouvier became Minister. At once I\r\ncaused the initiation of the measures wherein I could count upon the\r\nsupport of the Prince of Monaco. The Chancellor was instructed to\r\nprepare a rapprochement with France. And I particularly told Prince\r\nRadolin, who personally received his instructions in Berlin, to make\r\ngood use of the Rouvier régime for the purpose of eliminating all\r\npossibilities of conflict between the two countries. I added that the\r\nreports of the Prince of Monaco, with whom he was well acquainted,\r\nwould be useful to him in relations with Rouvier. Prince Radolin\r\nproceeded with zeal and pleasure to the accomplishment of this\r\nworth-while task.\r\n\r\nAt first the negotiations went well, so much so that I began to hope\r\nthat the important goal would be attained and the evil impression\r\ncaused by the Tangier visit effaced by an understanding. In the\r\nmeantime, the negotiations concerning Morocco were continued; they were\r\nconcluded, after endless trouble, by the summoning of the Algeciras\r\nConference, based upon the circular note of Prince Bülow, which\r\npointed out that the Most-Favored-Nation Clause No. 17 of the Madrid\r\nConvention should remain in force and that the reforms in Morocco,\r\nfor which France alone was working, should be carried out, in so far\r\nas necessary, only in agreement with the signatory powers of the\r\nMadrid Conference. These events, which riveted general attention upon\r\nthemselves, relegated the special negotiations with Rouvier to the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nWith regard to domestic policy, I had agreed with the Chancellor that\r\nhis main task was to be the restoration of order in the relations\r\nbetween the parties in the Reichstag, which had got into a bad way\r\nunder Hohenlohe, and, above all, to rally the Conservatives, who had\r\nbeen won over to the opposition by the Post-Bismarckians, once more to\r\nthe support of the Government. The Chancellor accomplished this task\r\nwith great patience and tenacity. He finally formed the famous \"bloc,\"\r\nwhich arose from the great electoral defeat of the Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative party had many members who had direct relations with\r\nthe court, and also with me personally, so that it was easier for this\r\nparty than for any other to become informed as to my plans in political\r\nand other matters and to discuss my ideas with me before they took\r\nshape in projects for laws. I have not the impression that this was\r\ndone to the extent that was possible; I might perhaps have come into\r\nagreement with the gentlemen, through informal conversations, in the\r\nquestion of the building of the Central Canal--opposed, as is well\r\nknown, by the Conservatives--as well as in the less important matters\r\nof the construction of the Cathedral and the Berlin Opera House, in\r\nwhich I was deeply interested for the sake of the Church and of art.\r\n\r\nI am saying nothing new if I remark that it was by no means easy to\r\ndeal with the gentlemen of the Conservative party. Through their\r\ntraditional services to the state they had acquired great experience\r\nand independence of judgment, and had thus formed firm political\r\nconvictions, to which they held faithfully and in a genuinely\r\nconservative manner. From their ranks great statesmen, eminent\r\nMinisters, a brilliant officer corps, a model body of officials, had\r\nlargely been produced. Therefore, the consciousness of their own merit\r\nwas not without justification; in addition, their loyalty to their King\r\nwas unshakable. The King and the country both owed them gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDS FAULT WITH CONSERVATIVES\r\n\r\nTheir weakness lay in the fact that they were at times too\r\nconservative--that is, they recognized too late the demands of the\r\ntime and began by opposing progress, although it might be progress\r\nadvantageous to themselves. One may understand this in view of their\r\npast, but the fact remains that it worked to the detriment of their\r\nrelations with me, especially during my reign, when the development\r\nof the Empire, particularly of industry and commerce, pushed rapidly\r\nforward; and I desired--and was obliged--to place no obstacles in the\r\nway of that development, but to promote it. When I said that it was not\r\nalways easy, for the reasons adduced, to deal with the Conservatives,\r\nI am well aware that the same thing is maintained about me. Perhaps\r\nthis is because I stood close to the Conservatives on account of my\r\ntraditions, but was not a Conservative for party reasons. I was and\r\nam, indeed, in favor of progressive conservatism, which preserves what\r\nis vital, rejects what is outworn, and accepts that portion of the new\r\nwhich is useful.\r\n\r\nLet me add that in discussions I was able to endure the truth, even\r\nwhen it was uncomfortable and bitter, better than people are aware,\r\nprovided it was told to me tactfully.\r\n\r\nSo that, when it is maintained that I and the Conservatives did not\r\nget along in dealings with each other, the same reason was at the root\r\nof the difficulty on both sides. It would have been better to arrive\r\noftener at an understanding with me in private conversations, for which\r\nI was always ready. And in the canal question, on which we could not\r\nagree, who was better qualified than the Conservative to understand and\r\nappreciate the fact that I have never subscribed to the pretty couplet,\r\n\"Unser König absolut, wenn er unseren Willen tut\" (\"Absolute our King\r\nmay be, if he does what we decree\")? For, had I acted according to\r\nthat principle--a very comfortable one for me--the Conservatives,\r\nin view of their belief in a strong King who really governs, would\r\nlogically have been forced to oppose me. Surely the Conservatives must\r\nhave respected me for having matched their honorable axiom of manly\r\npride before the thrones of Kings with mine of kingly pride before the\r\nConservative party's throne, just as I did with regard to all other\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the occasional differences with the Conservative party\r\nand with individual Conservatives cannot make me forget the services\r\nrendered by men of this very party to the House of Hohenzollern, the\r\nPrussian state, and the German Empire.\r\n\r\nBülow finally did the great trick of bringing Conservatives and\r\nLiberals together in Germany, thus getting a big majority for the\r\nparties siding with the Government. In doing so, the great abilities\r\nof the Chancellor, his skill, statecraft, and shrewd knowledge of men,\r\nshone forth most brilliantly. The great service rendered by him in\r\nachieving this success won him thorough appreciation and gratitude from\r\nhis country and from myself; and, in addition, an increase of my trust\r\nin him. The boundless delight of the people of Berlin in the defeat of\r\nthe Social Democrats at the polls led to the nocturnal demonstration,\r\nwhich I shall never forget, in front of my palace, in the course of\r\nwhich my automobile had to force a way for itself, little by little,\r\namid a cheering crowd of many thousands surrounding it. The Lustgarten\r\nwas packed with great multitudes of people, at whose tumultuous request\r\nthe Empress and I had to appear on the balcony in order to receive\r\ntheir homage.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor was present at the visit of King Edward VII to Kiel.\r\nAmong the many guests was the former Chief Court Marshal of the\r\nEmpress, Frederick, Count Seckendorff, long acquainted with Edward\r\nVII through his many visits to England, who reposed great trust in\r\nthe Count. This gentleman, at the behest of Bülow, with whom he was\r\nfriendly, arranged an interview between the King and the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nIt took place on board the royal English yacht after a breakfast to\r\nwhich I and the Chancellor were invited. Both gentlemen sat for a long\r\ntime alone over their cigars. Afterward Bülow reported to me what had\r\ntranspired at the interview. In discussing the possible conclusion of\r\nan alliance between Germany and England, the King, he told me, had\r\nstated that such a thing was not at all necessary in the case of our\r\ntwo countries, since there was no real cause for enmity or strife\r\nbetween them. This refusal to make an alliance was a plain sign of the\r\nEnglish \"policy of encirclement,\" which soon made itself felt clearly\r\nand disagreeably at the Algeciras Conference. The pro-French and\r\nanti-German attitude of England, which there came out into the open,\r\nwas due to special orders from King Edward VII, who had sent Sir D.\r\nMackenzie Wallace to Algeciras as his \"supervising representative,\"\r\nequipped with personal instructions.\r\n\r\nFrom hints given by the latter to his friends it turned out that it\r\nwas the King's wish to oppose Germany strongly and support France\r\nat every opportunity. When it was pointed out to him that it might\r\nbe possible, after all, to take up later with Germany this or that\r\nquestion and perhaps come to an understanding, he replied that,\r\nfirst of all came the Anglo-Russian agreement; that, once that was\r\nassured, an \"arrangement\" might be made with Germany also. The English\r\n\"arrangement\" consisted in the encirclement of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FRIENDSHIP WITH BÜLOW\r\n\r\nThe relations between me and the Chancellor remained trustful and\r\nfriendly throughout this period. He was present repeatedly at the Kiel\r\nregatta. Here, he found occasion, among other matters, to confer with\r\nthe Prince of Monaco and a number of influential Frenchmen, who were\r\nguests aboard the Prince's yacht, among whom doubtless the most eminent\r\nwas M. Jules Roche, the leading expert on European budgets, and a great\r\nadmirer of Goethe. He always carried a copy of _Faust_ in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1906, came the unfortunate collapse in the Reichstag of the\r\noverworked Chancellor. As soon as I received the news, I hurried there\r\nand was glad that Privy Councilor Renvers could give me encouraging\r\nnews about Bülow's condition. While the Prince was recuperating\r\nduring the summer at Norderney, I went from Heligoland, which I had\r\nbeen inspecting, on a torpedo boat to the island and surprised the\r\nChancellor and his wife at their villa. I spent the day in chatting\r\nwith the Chancellor, who had already recovered his health to an\r\nencouraging degree and was browned by the sea air and sunlight.\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn of 1907 the Empress and I paid a visit to Windsor,\r\nat the invitation of King Edward VII. We were most cordially received\r\nby the English royal family and the visit went off harmoniously. After\r\nthis visit I went for a rest to the castle of Highcliffe, belonging\r\nto General Stewart Worthley, situated on the south coast of England,\r\nopposite The Needles.\r\n\r\nBefore my departure for England, the Chancellor, who was much pleased\r\nat the English invitation, had long talks with me as to the best way\r\nfor getting on a better footing with England, and had suggested to\r\nme a number of his desires and projects, to serve me as guides in my\r\nconversations with Englishmen. During my visit I had frequent occasion\r\nto discuss the subjects agreed upon and conduct conversations as\r\ndesired by the Chancellor. Cipher telegrams containing my reports on\r\nthese conversations went regularly to Berlin and I repeatedly received\r\nfrom the Chancellor approving telegrams. I used to show these after\r\nthe evening meal to my intimates who accompanied me on my visit; these\r\nmen, among them the Chief Court Marshal Count Eulenburg and Prince Max\r\nEgon Fürstenberg, read them and rejoiced with me at the harmonious\r\nunderstanding between me and the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nAfter my return from England I made a general report to the Chancellor,\r\nwhereupon he expressed to me his thanks for my having personally\r\ntroubled myself so much and worked so hard toward improving the\r\nrelations between the two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENDS FAMOUS INTERVIEW[6]\r\n\r\nA year later came the incident about the so-called \"interview,\"\r\npublished in the _Daily Telegraph_. Its object was the improvement of\r\nGerman-English relations. I had sent the draft submitted to me to the\r\nChancellor for examination through the representative of the Foreign\r\nOffice, Herr von Jenisch. I had called attention, by means of notes, to\r\ncertain portions which, to my way of thinking, did not belong therein\r\nand should be eliminated. Through a series of mistakes on the part of\r\nthe Foreign Office, when the matter was taken up at my request, this\r\nwas not done.\r\n\r\nA storm broke loose in the press. The Chancellor spoke in the\r\nReichstag, but did not defend the Kaiser, who was the object of attack,\r\nto the extent that I expected, declaring, on the other hand, that he\r\nwished to prevent in future the tendency toward \"personal politics\"\r\nwhich had become apparent in the last few years. The Conservative party\r\ntook upon itself to address an open letter to the King through the\r\nnewspapers, the contents of which are known.\r\n\r\nDuring these proceedings, I was staying first at Eckartsau, with Franz\r\nFerdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, and later with Kaiser Franz\r\nJoseph at Vienna, both of whom disapproved of the Chancellor's conduct.\r\nFrom Vienna I went to Donaueschingen to visit Prince Fürstenberg, to\r\nwhom the press saw fit to address the demand that he should, being\r\nan honest, upright man, tell the Emperor the truth for once. When we\r\ntalked over the whole matter, the Prince advised me to get together,\r\nat the Foreign Office, the dispatches from Highcliffe in 1907, and the\r\nanswers to them, and have these laid before the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nDuring this whole affair I underwent great mental anguish, which was\r\nheightened by the sudden death before my eyes of the intimate friend\r\nof my youth, Count Hülsen-Haeseler, chief of the Military Cabinet.\r\nThe faithful, self-sacrificing friendship and care of the Prince and\r\nhis family were most welcome to me in these bitter days. And letters\r\nand demonstrations from the Empire, part of which sided with me and\r\nseverely censured the Chancellor, were a consolation to me during that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAfter my return, the Chancellor appeared, lectured me on my political\r\nsins, and asked that I sign the document that is already known, which\r\nwas afterward communicated to the press. I signed it in silence and in\r\nsilence I endured the attacks of the press against myself and the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor struck a serious blow, by his conduct, at the firm\r\nconfidence and sincere friendship which had bound me before to him.\r\nUndoubtedly Prince Bülow thought that, handling the matter as he did\r\nboth in the Reichstag and with me personally, he could best serve me\r\nand the cause, especially as public excitement was running very high\r\nat that time. In this I could not agree with him, all the more so\r\nsince his actions toward me in the _Daily Telegraph_ affair stood out\r\nin too sharp contrast to the complaisance and recognition which Bülow\r\nhad previously manifested toward me. I had become so accustomed to the\r\namiability of the Prince that I found the treatment now accorded me\r\nincomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BREAK WITH BÜLOW\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Emperor and Chancellor, excellent and amicable\r\nup to that time, was, at all events, disturbed. I gave up personal\r\nrelations with the Chancellor and confined myself to official dealings.\r\nAfter consultation with the Minister of the Royal Household and the\r\nchief of the Cabinet, I resolved to follow Prince Fürstenberg's advice\r\nas to getting together the Highcliffe dispatches, and charged the\r\nForeign Office with this task. It failed of accomplishment because the\r\ndispatches in question were not to be found.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the winter the Chancellor requested an audience\r\nwith me. I walked up and down with him in the picture gallery of the\r\npalace, between the pictures of my ancestors, of the battles of the\r\nSeven Years' War, of the proclamation of the Empire at Versailles,\r\nand was amazed when the Chancellor harked back to the events of the\r\nautumn of 1908 and undertook to explain his attitude. Thereupon I took\r\noccasion to talk with him about the entire past. The frank talk and\r\nthe explanations of the Prince satisfied me. The result was that he\r\nremained in office.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor requested that I dine with him that evening, as I had so\r\noften done before, in order to show the outer world that all was again\r\nwell. I did so. A pleasant evening, enlivened by the visibly delighted\r\nPrincess with charming amiability, and by the Prince with his usual\r\nlively, witty talk, closed that memorable day. Alluding to the Prince's\r\naudience with me, a wag wrote later in a newspaper, parodying a famous\r\nline: \"The tear flows, Germania has me again.\"\r\n\r\nBy this reconciliation I also wished to show that I was in the\r\nhabit of sacrificing my own sensitiveness to the good of the cause.\r\nDespite Prince Bülow's attitude toward me in the Reichstag, which\r\nwas calculated to pain me, I naturally never forgot his eminent gifts\r\nas a statesman and his distinguished services to the fatherland. He\r\nsucceeded, by his skill, in avoiding a world war at several moments of\r\ncrisis, during the period indeed, when I, together with Tirpitz, was\r\nbuilding our protecting fleet. That was a great achievement.\r\n\r\nA serious epilogue to the above-mentioned audience was provided by the\r\nConservatives. The Civil Cabinet informed the party leaders of the\r\nChancellor's audience and what happened there, with the request that\r\nthe party might now take back its \"Open Letter.\" This request--which\r\nwas made solely in the interest of the Crown, not of myself\r\npersonally--was declined by the party. Not until 1916, when the war\r\nwas under way, did we get into touch again, through a delegate of the\r\nparty, at Great General Headquarters.\r\n\r\nJust as the Conservatives did not do enough out of respect for the\r\nCrown to satisfy me, so also the Liberals of the Left, the Democrats\r\nand the Socialists, distinguished themselves by an outburst of fury,\r\nwhich became, in their partisan press, a veritable orgy, in which\r\nloud demands were made for the limitation of autocratic, despotic\r\ninclinations, etc. This agitation lasted the whole winter, without\r\nhindrance or objection from high Government circles. Only after the\r\nChancellor's audience did it stop.\r\n\r\nLater, a coolness gradually arose between the Chancellor and\r\nthe political parties. The Conservatives drew away from the\r\nLiberals--rifts appeared in the bloc. Centrists and Socialists--but,\r\nabove all, the Chancellor himself--brought about its downfall, as Count\r\nHertling repeatedly explained to me later--for the last time at Spa. He\r\nwas proud to have worked energetically toward causing Bülow's downfall.\r\n\r\nWhen matters had reached an impossible pass, the Chancellor drew\r\nthe proper conclusions and recommended to me the choice of Herr\r\nvon Bethmann as the fifth Chancellor of the Empire. After careful\r\nconsultations, I decided to acquiesce in the wish of Prince Bülow, to\r\naccept his request for retirement, and to summon the man recommended by\r\nhim as his successor.\r\n\r\n  [6] One of the most startling incidents of the Kaiser's reign was\r\n      the interview with him printed in the London _Daily Telegraph_\r\n      of Oct. 28, 1908. In it he said that \"Englishmen, in giving rein\r\n      to suspicions unworthy of a great nation,\" were \"mad as March\r\n      hares\"; and that \"the prevailing sentiment among large sections\r\n      of the middle and lower classes of my own people is not friendly\r\n      to England. I am, therefore, so to speak, in a minority in my\r\n      own land, but it is a minority of the best elements, just as it\r\n      is in England with respect to Germany.\" German opinion was, he\r\n      admitted, \"bitterly hostile\" to England during the Boer War, and,\r\n      that the German people, if he had permitted Boer delegates in\r\n      Berlin, \"would have crowned them with flowers.\" He asserted that\r\n      he had formulated a plan of campaign in South Africa which Lord\r\n      Roberts adopted in substance.\r\n\r\n      The Kaiser was quoted in this interview as declaring Germany\r\n      needed a large fleet chiefly on account of the Far Eastern\r\n      situation.\r\n\r\n      The interview was republished in official German organs, and\r\n      caused as great a stir in Germany as in England. There were many\r\n      debates on it in the Reichstag and one or two \"investigations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBethmann\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been well acquainted since my youth with Herr von Bethmann\r\nHollweg. When I was in active service for the first time in 1877, as\r\nLieutenant in the Sixth Company of the First Infantry Guard Regiment,\r\nit was quartered once at Hohenfinow, the home of old Herr von Bethmann,\r\nfather of the Chancellor. I was attracted by the pleasant family circle\r\nthere, which was presided over by Frau von Bethmann, a most worthy\r\nlady, born of Swiss nationality, amiable and refined.\r\n\r\nOften, as Prince and later as Emperor, I went to Hohenfinow to visit\r\nthe old gentleman, and I was received on every occasion by the young\r\nhead of the rural district administration; at that time neither of us\r\nimagined that he would become Imperial Chancellor under me.\r\n\r\nFrom these visits an intimate relationship sprang up little by little,\r\nwhich served to increase steadily my esteem for the diligence, ability,\r\nand noble character of Bethmann, which were much to my liking. These\r\nqualities clung to him throughout his career.\r\n\r\nAs Chief President and as Imperial Secretary of State for the Interior\r\nBethmann gave a good account of himself, and, while occupying the\r\nlast-named post, made his appearance successfully before the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nCo-operation with the Chancellor was easy for me. With Bethmann I kept\r\nup my custom of daily visits whenever possible, and of discussing fully\r\nwith him, while walking in the garden of the Chancellor's palace, on\r\npolitics, events of the day, special bills, and occurrences and of\r\nhearing reports from him. It was also a pleasure for me to visit the\r\nChancellor's home, since Bethmann's spouse was the very model of a\r\ngenuine German wife, one whose simple distinction earned the esteem\r\nof every visitor, while her winning kindness of heart spread around\r\nher an atmosphere of cordiality. During the Bethmann régime the custom\r\nof holding small evening receptions, instituted by Prince Bülow and\r\nmost enjoyable to me, was continued, and this enabled me to keep on\r\nassociating informally with men of all circles and walks of life.\r\n\r\nIn the journeys which the Chancellor had to make in order to introduce\r\nhimself, he won esteem everywhere by his distinguished calm and sincere\r\nmethods of expression. Such foreign countries as were not hostile to us\r\nconsidered him a factor making for political stability and peace, to\r\nthe maintenance and strengthening of which he devoted his most zealous\r\nefforts. This was entirely to my liking.\r\n\r\nIn foreign politics he busied himself from the start with the position\r\nof England in relation to Germany and with the \"policy of encirclement\"\r\nof King Edward VII, which had made itself felt more and more since\r\nReval, and was a source of worry to Bethmann. This was likewise true\r\nof the growing desire for revenge and enmity of France, and the\r\nunreliability of Russia. During his régime as Chancellor it became\r\nclear that Italy was no longer to be reckoned with militarily; the work\r\nof Barrère in that country made \"extra tours\" chronic.\r\n\r\nUpon assuming office, Herr von Bethmann found the situation with regard\r\nto France cleared up to such an extent that the German-French Morocco\r\nAgreement had been signed on February 9, 1909. By recognizing thereby\r\nthe political predominance of France in Morocco Prince Bülow had put\r\nthe finishing touch to the German political retreat from Morocco. The\r\nstandpoint which had determined the trip to Tangier and, in addition,\r\nthe Algeciras Conference, was thereby definitely abandoned. The great\r\nsatisfaction of the French Government over this victory was expressed\r\nin a manner unwelcome to us by the conferring of the cross of the\r\nLegion of Honor upon Prince Radolin and Herr von Schoen.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIVES BRITISH ROYALTY\r\n\r\nOn the same day King Edward VII, with Queen Alexandra, made his first\r\nofficial visit to the German Emperor and his wife at their capital\r\ncity of Berlin--eight years after his accession to the throne! Berlin\r\nreceived the exalted gentleman with rejoicing (!!) and showed no signs\r\nof dissatisfaction at his unfriendly policy.\r\n\r\nThe King did not look well; he was tired and aged, and suffered,\r\nmoreover, from a severe attack of catarrh. Nevertheless, he accepted\r\nthe invitation of the municipal authorities of Berlin to informal tea\r\nat the City Hall. From his description, which was corroborated by\r\nBerlin gentlemen, the function must have been satisfactory to both\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nI informed my uncle of the signing of the German-French Morocco\r\nAgreement and the news seemed to please him. When I added, \"I hope this\r\nagreement will be a stepping stone to a better understanding between\r\nthe two countries,\" the King nodded his head approvingly and said, \"May\r\nthat be so!\" If the King had co-operated toward this, my project would\r\nprobably not have failed. Nevertheless, the visit of Their English\r\nMajesties engendered a more friendly atmosphere for the time being,\r\nwhich greeted Herr von Bethmann upon his assuming office.\r\n\r\nDuring his term of office Herr von Bethmann had plenty of foreign\r\nmatters to handle, connected with the well-known events of 1909-14.\r\nConcerning this period a mass of material has been published in\r\ndifferent quarters, for instance, in the book, _Causes of the World\r\nWar_, by Secretary of State von Jagow. In the _Belgian Documents_ the\r\nattitude of the German Government in the various complications is\r\ndescribed from a neutral standpoint. I had based this attitude on the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    Caution on the one hand, on the other, support of our\r\n    Austro-Hungarian allies whenever there is a plain threat against\r\n    their position as a world power, combined with counsels of\r\n    moderation in action. Efforts in the rôle of \"honest broker\"\r\n    everywhere, activity as a go-between wherever peace seems\r\n    endangered. Firm assertion of our own interests.\r\n\r\nIn view of the \"encirclement\" ambitions of our opponents, we were in\r\nduty bound, for the sake of self-preservation, to work steadily at\r\nthe same time toward building up our army and navy for purposes of\r\ndefense, because of the central location of Germany and her open,\r\nunprotected frontiers. This period of history is also well described in\r\nStegemann's book, and Helfferich and Friedjung also depict the prewar\r\ndays interestingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"EDWARD THE ENCIRCLER\"\r\n\r\nThe death of the \"encircler,\" Edward VII--of whom it was said once, in\r\na report of the Belgian Embassy at Berlin, that \"the peace of Europe\r\nwas never in such danger as when the King of England concerned himself\r\nwith maintaining it\"--called me to London, where I shared with my close\r\nrelations, the members of the English royal family, the mourning into\r\nwhich the passing of the King had thrown the dynasty and the nation.\r\nThe entire royal family received me at the railway station as a token\r\nof their gratitude for the deference to family ties shown by my coming.\r\n\r\nKing George drove with me to Westminster Hall, where the gorgeously\r\ndecorated coffin reposed upon a towering catafalque, guarded by\r\nhousehold troops, troops of the line, and detachments from the\r\nIndian and Colonial contingents, all in the traditional attitude of\r\nmourning--heads bowed, hands crossed over the butts and hilts of their\r\nreversed arms. The old, gray hall, covered by its great Gothic wooden\r\nceiling, towered imposingly over the catafalque, lighted merely by a\r\nfew rays of the sun filtering through narrow windows. One ray flooded\r\nthe magnificent coffin of the King, surmounted by the English crown,\r\nand made marvelous play with the colors of the precious stones adorning\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPast the catafalque countless throngs of men, women, and children of\r\nall classes and strata in the nation passed in silence, many with hands\r\nfolded to bid a reverent farewell to him who had been so popular as a\r\nruler. A most impressive picture, in its marvelous mediæval setting.\r\n\r\nI went up to the catafalque, with King George, placed a cross upon it,\r\nand spoke a silent prayer, after which my right hand and that of my\r\nroyal cousin found each other, quite unconsciously on our part, and met\r\nin a firm clasp. This made a deep impression on those who witnessed it,\r\nto such an extent that, in the evening, one of my relations said to me:\r\n\"Your handshake with our King is all over London: the people are deeply\r\nimpressed by it, and take it as a good omen for the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the sincerest wish of my heart,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nAs I rode through London behind the coffin of my uncle I was a witness\r\nof the tremendous and impressive demonstration of grief on the part\r\nof the vast multitude--estimated at several millions--on streets,\r\nbalconies, and roofs, every one of whom was clad in black, every man\r\nof whom stood with bared head, among all of whom reigned perfect order\r\nand absolute stillness. Upon this somber, solemn background the files\r\nof British soldiers stood out all the more gorgeously. In splendid\r\narray marched the battalions of the English Guards: Grenadiers, Scots\r\nGuards, Coldstreams, Irish Guards--in their perfectly-fitting coats,\r\nwhite leather facings, and heavy bearskin headgear; all picked troops\r\nof superb appearance and admirable martial bearing, a joy to any man\r\nwith the heart of a soldier. And all the troops lining the path of the\r\nfuneral cortège stood in the attitude of mourning already described.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay I resided, at the special desire of King George, in\r\nBuckingham Palace. The widow of the dead King, Queen Alexandra,\r\nreceived me with moving and charming kindness, and talked much with me\r\nabout bygone days; my recollections stretched back to my childhood,\r\nsince I, while still a little boy, had been present at the wedding of\r\nmy dead uncle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PICHON CONVERSATION\r\n\r\nThe King gave a banquet to the many princely guests and their suites,\r\nas well as for the representatives of foreign nations, at which M.\r\nPichon was also present. He was introduced to me and, in conversation\r\nwith him, I told him of the wishes which the Imperial Chancellor had\r\ncommunicated to me regarding our interests in Morocco and some other\r\npolitical matters, which M. Pichon readily agreed to carry out. All\r\nother combinations connected in various quarters with this talk, belong\r\nin the domain of fancy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the period between 1909 and 1914 demanded extraordinary\r\nattention to foreign events, interior development was, nevertheless,\r\npromoted zealously, and efforts made to meet the demands of commerce,\r\ntransportation, agriculture, and industry, which were growing rapidly.\r\nUnfortunately endeavors in this direction were made much more difficult\r\nby the discord among political parties.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor wished to accomplish everything possible of\r\naccomplishment. But his inclination to get to the bottom of problems\r\nand his desire to deal only with what was, from his meticulous critical\r\nstandpoint, thoroughly matured, tended, in the course of time, to\r\nhamper progress. It was difficult to bring him to make decisions\r\nbefore he was thoroughly convinced of their being absolutely free from\r\nobjection. This made working with him tiresome and aroused in those not\r\nclose to him the impression of vacillation, whereas, in reality, it was\r\nmerely overconscientiousness carried too far.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Chancellor eventually developed a strong and growing\r\ninclination toward domination; in discussions this tended to make\r\nhim obstinate and caused him to lay down the law to those thinking\r\notherwise as dogmatically as a school teacher. This brought him many\r\nenemies and often made things hard for me. A boyhood friend of the\r\nChancellor, to whom I spoke once about this, replied, with a smile,\r\nthat it had been so with him even in school; there Herr von Bethmann\r\nhad constantly taught and school-mastered his fellow students, of whom\r\nmy informant was one, so that finally his classmates had nicknamed\r\nhim \"the governess.\" He added that this trait was a misfortune for\r\nBethmann, but that it had so grown into his very being that he would\r\nnever be able to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is Bethmann's relationship to Herr von Kiderlen,\r\nwhom he desired to have as Secretary of State, despite my emphatic\r\nobjections. Herr von Kiderlen was an able worker and a man of strong\r\ncharacter, who always sought to assert his independence. He had been\r\nabout one year in office when Herr von Bethmann came to me one day,\r\ncomplained of Kiderlen's obstinacy and insubordination, and asked me\r\nto appeal to his conscience. I declined, with the observation that the\r\nChancellor had chosen Kiderlen against my wishes and must now manage to\r\nget along with him; that the maintenance of discipline at the Foreign\r\nOffice was a duty devolving upon the Chancellor, in which I had no\r\ndesire to interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDS FAULT WITH BETHMANN\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bethmann's inadequacy to the post of Chancellor became\r\nevident. Deep down in his heart he was a pacifist and was obsessed\r\nwith the aberration of coming to an understanding with England. I can\r\nperfectly well understand that a man of pacifist inclinations should\r\nact thus in the hope of avoiding a war thereby. His object was entirely\r\nin accord with my policy. The ways and means whereby Bethmann sought\r\nto achieve it were, in my opinion, unsuitable. Nevertheless, I backed\r\nhis endeavors. But I certainly did not believe that real success would\r\nresult. It became ever more apparent, while he was Chancellor, that\r\nhe was remote from political realities. Yet he always knew everything\r\nbetter than anybody else. Owing to this overestimation of his own\r\npowers he stuck unswervingly to his ideas, even when things all turned\r\nout differently from what he had expected.\r\n\r\nHis reports were always admirably prepared, brilliant in form, and,\r\nhence, impressive and attractive. And in this there was an element of\r\ndanger. In his opinion there was always but one solution, the one which\r\nhe proposed! The apparent solidity and thoroughness of his reports and\r\nsuggestions, the illuminating treatment of the matters reported upon\r\nfrom every angle, the references to experts, to foreign and native\r\nstatesmen and diplomats, etc., easily led to the impression that solely\r\nthe Bethmann solution was worthy of consideration. In spite of these\r\nthorough preparations, he made mistake after mistake.\r\n\r\nThus he had an actual share in our misfortune. When I returned from my\r\nNorwegian trip in 1914 he did not place his resignation in my hands,\r\nto be sure, but he admitted that his political calculations had gone\r\nwrong. Nevertheless, I left him in office, even after his Reichstag\r\nspeech and the English declaration of war of August 4, 1914, because I\r\nconsidered it most serious to change the highest official in the Empire\r\nat the most critical moment in German history. The unanimous attitude\r\nof the nation in the face of the challenge from the Entente might have\r\nbeen impaired by such action.\r\n\r\nMoreover, both the Chancellor and the chief of the Civil Cabinet\r\nmaintained that they had the working classes behind them. I was loath\r\nto deprive the working classes, which behaved in an exemplary manner in\r\n1914, of the statesman whom, I had been told, they trusted.\r\n\r\nThe theory, constantly repeated to me in 1914 by the chief of the\r\nCivil Cabinet and the representative of the Foreign Office, that\r\nonly Bethmann had the support of the working classes, was finally\r\nsupplemented further by reports to me that the Chancellor enjoyed the\r\nconfidence in foreign countries which was necessary to the conclusion\r\nof peace. Thus it came about that Bethmann always stayed in office,\r\nuntil, finally, the Crown Prince made the well-known investigation\r\namong the party leaders which showed that the above-mentioned theory\r\nwas mistaken. This mistake was made all the clearer to me when I read,\r\nat the time of Bethmann's dismissal--to which other factors also\r\ncontributed--the most unfavorable opinions of him, especially in the\r\nSocial Democratic and Democratic press.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to blame Bethmann with these frank remarks, nor to\r\nexonerate others; but, when such important matters are discussed,\r\npersonal considerations must be ignored. I never doubted the nobility\r\nof Bethmann's sentiments.\r\n\r\nMay I be allowed to say a few words here concerning the reform in the\r\nPrussian franchise, since the handling of this by Herr von Bethmann\r\nis characteristic of his policy of vacillation. During the winter of\r\n1914-15, when, following the brilliant summer campaign, the hard,\r\nsevere winter trench-fighting had brought military movements to a\r\nstandstill, the extraordinary achievements of all the troops and the\r\nspirit which I had found among officers and men, both at the front and\r\nin the hospitals, made such a profound impression on me that I resolved\r\nto provide, for the tried, magnificent \"Nation in Arms,\" something in\r\nthe political domain, when it returned home, which should prove that I\r\nrecognized what it had done and wished to give the nation joy.\r\n\r\nI often touched upon this theme in conversations and suggested reforms\r\nin the Prussian franchise; the man, said I, who returned home, after a\r\nstruggle like this, with the Iron Cross--perhaps of both classes--must\r\nno longer be \"classified\" at the polls.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a memorial was submitted to me by Herr von Loebell\r\nwhich proposed a reform in the Prussian franchise on similar grounds.\r\nThe concise, clear, and convincing treatment of the subject pleased me\r\nso much that I had a number of gentlemen read the memorial, which took\r\nup, in its original form, only general points of view, without going\r\ninto detail, and I was pleased to see that it found approval with all\r\nwhom I questioned concerning it.\r\n\r\nI had my thanks expressed to Herr von Loebell through the chief of the\r\nCabinet, von Valentini, and caused Loebell to work out the matter in\r\ndetail and make suggestions. This was done in the spring of 1915. The\r\nmemorial was very thorough and dealt with a number of possibilities\r\nfor the franchise, without advising any one system. It was approved\r\nby me, and sent by the chief of the Cabinet to the Chancellor, with\r\nthe command that it be discussed, in the course of the year, by the\r\nMinisters, and that their vote on it--possibly, also, some suggestions\r\nfrom them--be laid before me. The franchise law, of course, was not to\r\nbe proposed until after the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY GERMAN VICTORIES\r\n\r\nImmediately after that I went to Pless. The battle of Gorlice-Tarnow,\r\nwith its smashing victory over the enemy, brought on the\r\nGalician-Polish campaign, leading to the reconquest of Lemberg,\r\nPrzemysl and the capture of Warsaw, Ivangorod, Modlin, Brest-Litovsk,\r\netc., and completely engaged my attention.\r\n\r\nThe _Lusitania_ case, too, cast its shadow over events, and Italy\r\nsevered her alliance with us. So it is not to be wondered at if the\r\nfranchise memorial was pushed into the background.\r\n\r\nThe next winter, and the summer of 1916, likewise, with their fighting\r\non all fronts, the terrible battle of the Somme, and the brilliant\r\nRumanian autumn and winter campaign, took me to all sorts of places on\r\nthe western and eastern fronts, even as far as Nisch--where the first\r\nmemorable meeting with the Bulgarian Tsar took place--and to Orsova,\r\nso that I had no opportunity to take up the matter of franchise reform\r\nwith the care that its importance demanded.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1917 I asked the Chancellor to draw up an announcement\r\nof the reform, to be made to the nation at Easter, since I assumed that\r\nthe Ministers had long since discussed it. The Chancellor drew up the\r\ntext of the proclamation at Hamburg, in agreement with the chief of the\r\nCabinet and myself; he proposed that the method of voting be left open\r\nfor the time being, since he was not yet quite sure about this. The\r\nEaster proclamation appeared; it was based, like previous treatments of\r\nthe matter, on the idea that the reform was not to be introduced until\r\nafter the conclusion of peace, because most of the voters were away\r\nfacing the enemy.\r\n\r\nParty and press did what they could to postpone the accomplishment of\r\nmy purpose by recriminations and strife, by bringing up the question\r\nof the Prussian Reichstag franchise, and by the demand for the\r\nintroduction of the franchise bill while the war was still in progress.\r\nThus the question embarked upon its well-known and not very pleasant\r\ncourse, which dragged itself out on account of the interminable\r\nnegotiations in the Landtag. It was not until after the retirement of\r\nHerr von Bethmann that I learned through Loebell that the memorial\r\nof 1915 had never been submitted to the Ministers, but had lain\r\nuntouched for a year and a half in a desk drawer; that the Chancellor,\r\ninfluenced by the desires expressed in the country, had dropped the\r\nvarious systems proposed and concentrated upon the general (Reichstag)\r\nfranchise, of the eventual introduction of which he was, doubtless,\r\ninwardly convinced.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the original basic idea was thoroughly bungled by\r\nBethmann's dilatoriness and the strife among the parties. What I wanted\r\nwas to present a gift of honor, of my own free will, on its triumphal\r\nreturn home, to my victorious army, to my \"Nation in Arms,\" my brave\r\nPrussians, with whom I had stood before the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR'S DIPLOMATIC POWER\r\n\r\nOne of the results of Bethmann's marked inclination toward control\r\nwas that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was, under him, a\r\nmere helper, so much so that the Foreign Office was almost affiliated\r\nwith the office of the Chancellor, a state of affairs that made itself\r\nfelt most especially in the use made of the press department. Bethmann\r\nlikewise asserted his independence decidedly in his relations with me.\r\nBasing himself upon the fact that, constitutionally, the Chancellor\r\nalone is responsible for foreign policy, he ruled as he pleased. The\r\nForeign Office was allowed to tell me only what the Chancellor wished,\r\nso that it happened sometimes that I was not informed concerning\r\nimportant occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this was possible is to be laid at the door of the\r\nConstitution of the Empire. And this is the right place for saying a\r\nword concerning the relations between the Emperor and the Chancellor.\r\nIn what follows I do not refer to my relationship to Herr von Bethmann,\r\nbut, quite impersonally, to the difficulties in the relationship of the\r\nGerman Emperor to the Imperial Chancellors, which are caused by the\r\nImperial Constitution.\r\n\r\nI wish to call attention to the following points:\r\n\r\n1. According to the Constitution of the Empire, the Chancellor is the\r\ndirector and representative of the foreign policy of the Empire, for\r\nwhich he assumes full responsibility; he has this policy carried out by\r\nthe Foreign Office, which is subordinated to him, after he has reported\r\non it to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n2. The Emperor has influence on foreign policy only in so far as the\r\nChancellor grants it to him.\r\n\r\n3. The Emperor can bring his influence to bear through discussions,\r\ninformation, suggestion, proposals, reports, and impressions received\r\nby him on his travels, which then take rank as a supplement to the\r\npolitical reports of the ambassadors or ministers to the countries\r\nwhich he has personally visited.\r\n\r\n4. The Chancellor _may_ act pursuant to such action by the Emperor, and\r\nmay make it the basis of his decisions, whenever he is in agreement\r\nwith the Emperor's point of view. Otherwise he is supposed to maintain\r\n_his own_ point of view and carry it out (Kruger dispatch).\r\n\r\n5. According to the Constitution, the Emperor has no means of\r\ncompelling the Chancellor or the Foreign Office to accept his views.\r\nHe cannot cause the Chancellor to adopt a policy for which the latter\r\nfeels that he cannot assume responsibility. Should the Emperor stick to\r\nhis view, the Chancellor can offer his resignation or demand that he be\r\nrelieved of his post.\r\n\r\n6. On the other hand, the Emperor has no constitutional means of\r\nhindering the Chancellor or the Foreign Office from carrying out a\r\npolicy which he thinks doubtful or mistaken. All he can do, if the\r\nChancellor insists, is to make a change in the Chancellorship.\r\n\r\n7. Every change of Chancellors, however, is a serious matter, deeply\r\naffecting the life of the nation, and hence, at a time of political\r\ncomplications and high tension, an extremely serious step, an ultima\r\nratio (last resort) which is all the more daring in that the number of\r\nmen qualified to fill this abnormally difficult post is very small.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Imperial Chancellor, which was based on the\r\ntowering personality of Prince Bismarck, had assumed a serious\r\npreponderance through the constantly growing number of posts under\r\nthe Empire, over all of which the Chancellor was placed as chief and\r\nresponsible head.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\nIf this is borne in mind, it is absolutely impossible that anybody\r\nshould still hold the Emperor alone responsible for everything, as was\r\ndone formerly, especially toward the end of the war and after the war,\r\nby critical know-it-alls and carping revolutionists, both at home and\r\nin the Entente countries. That, quite apart from everything personal,\r\nis a proof of complete ignorance of the earlier Constitution of the\r\nGerman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Tsar to Potsdam in November, 1910, went off to the\r\nsatisfaction of all concerned, and was utilized by the Chancellor and\r\nHerr von Kiderlen to get into touch with the newly appointed Foreign\r\nMinister, Sazonoff, whom the Tsar had brought with him. Apparently,\r\nthe Russian ruler enjoyed himself among us, and he took an active\r\npart in the hunt arranged in his honor, at which he proved himself an\r\nenthusiastic huntsman. The result of the conferences between the two\r\nstatesmen seemed to promise well for the future; both, after they had\r\nfelt each other out, harbored the hope of favorable relations between\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nDuring my spring visit to Corfu, the Melissori troubles began, which\r\nriveted Greek attention upon themselves. Corfu was well informed of\r\nthe constant smuggling of arms from Italy by way of Valona into\r\nAlbania, and there was a feeling in Greek circles that machinations\r\nfrom across the Adriatic, as well as from Montenegro, were not without\r\nresponsibility for what was happening. It was also felt that the new\r\nTurkish Government had not been wise in its handling of the Albanians,\r\nwho were very sensitive and suspicious; the former Sultan Abdul-Hamid\r\nhad realized this very well and understood admirably how to get along\r\nwith the Albanians and to keep them quiet. Nevertheless, there was no\r\nfear that more serious complications would ensue.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1911 I received a most cordial invitation from King\r\nGeorge of England to be present at the unveiling of the statue of Queen\r\nVictoria, the grandmother of both of us. Therefore I went in the middle\r\nof May to London with the Empress and our daughter. The reception on\r\nthe part of the English royal family and the people of London was\r\ncordial.\r\n\r\nThe unveiling festivities were well arranged and very magnificent.\r\nThe big, round space in front of Buckingham Palace was surrounded by\r\ngrandstands, which were filled to overflowing by invited guests. In\r\nfront of them were files of soldiers of all arms and all regiments of\r\nthe British army, in full parade uniform, the cavalry and artillery\r\nbeing on foot. All the banners of the troops were arrayed at the foot\r\nof the statue.\r\n\r\nThe royal family, with their guests and their suites, was grouped\r\naround the statue. King George made a dedication speech which had a\r\ngood effect, in which he made mention also of the German Imperial\r\ncouple.\r\n\r\nThen, amid salutes and greetings, the statue was unveiled; the Queen,\r\nin marble, seated upon a throne, became visible, surmounted by a golden\r\nfigure of victory. It was an impressive moment. Afterward the troops\r\nmarched past, the Guards in the van, then the Highlanders--who, with\r\ntheir gayly colored, becoming costume, gave an especially picturesque\r\ntouch to the military spectacle--then the rest of the soldiers. The\r\nmarch past was carried out on the circular space, with all the troops\r\nconstantly wheeling: the outer wings had to step out, the inner to hold\r\nback--a most difficult task for troops. The evolution was carried out\r\nbrilliantly; not one man made a mistake. The Duke of Connaught, who had\r\nmade all the military arrangements, deservedly won unanimous applause.\r\n\r\n\r\nFESTIVITIES IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our stay in England was devoted to excursions; we also\r\nenjoyed the hospitality of noble English families, at whose homes there\r\nwas an opportunity to hold intercourse with many members of English\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nSpecial enjoyment in the domain of art was provided by the King to his\r\nguests by a theatrical performance at Drury Lane Theater. A well-known\r\nEnglish play, \"Money,\" was performed, by a company especially\r\nassembled for the occasion, consisting of the leading actors and\r\nactresses of London. As a surprise, a curtain fell between the acts,\r\npainted especially for the occasion by a lady, which depicted King\r\nGeorge and me, life size, on horseback, riding toward each other and\r\nsaluting militarily. The picture was executed with much dash and was\r\nenthusiastically acclaimed by the audience.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the actors and actresses in \"Money\" was veritably\r\nmasterly, since all concerned played their rôles, even the smallest, to\r\nperfection. In fact, it was a classic performance.\r\n\r\nAnother day I attended, at the Olympia track, the sports of the British\r\narmy and navy, which included admirable individual feats on foot and\r\nhorseback, as well as evolutions by bodies of troops in close formation.\r\n\r\nIn describing the unveiling of the statue, as well as the funeral of\r\nKing Edward VII, I have concerned myself purposely with the externals\r\nand pomp that are characteristic of such occasions in England. They\r\nshow that, in a land under parliamentary rule, a so-called democratic\r\nland, more importance is attached to well-nigh mediæval magnificence\r\nthan in the young German Empire.\r\n\r\nThe French actions in Morocco, which were no longer such as could\r\nbe reconciled with the Algeciras Agreement, had once more engaged\r\nthe attention of the diplomats. For this reason the Chancellor had\r\nrequested me to find out, as soon as opportunity should arise, what\r\nKing George thought about the situation.\r\n\r\nI asked him if he thought that the French methods were still in\r\naccordance with the Algeciras Agreement. The King remarked that the\r\nagreement, to tell the truth, no longer was in force, and that the best\r\nthing to do would be to forget it; that the French, fundamentally, were\r\ndoing nothing different in Morocco from what the English had previously\r\ndone in Egypt; that, therefore, England would place no obstacles in the\r\npath of the French, but would let them alone; that the thing to do was\r\nto recognize the \"fait accompli\" of the occupation of Morocco and make\r\narrangements, for commercial protection, with France.\r\n\r\nTo the very end the visit went off well, and the inhabitants of London,\r\nof all social strata, expressed their good will every time the guests\r\nof their King showed themselves.\r\n\r\nThus the German Imperial couple was enabled to return home with the\r\nbest of impressions. When I informed the Chancellor of these, he\r\nexpressed great satisfaction. From the remarks of King George he drew\r\nthe inference that England considered the Algeciras Agreement no longer\r\nvalid and would not place any obstacles in the way of the French\r\noccupation of Morocco.\r\n\r\nFrom this the policy followed by him and the Foreign Office arose which\r\nled to the Agadir case, the last and equally unsuccessful attempt to\r\nmaintain our influence in Morocco. The situation became more serious\r\nduring the Kiel regatta week. The Foreign Office informed me of its\r\nintention to send the _Panther_ to Agadir. I gave expression to strong\r\nmisgivings as to this step, but had to drop them in view of the urgent\r\nrepresentations of the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of 1912 came the sending of Sir Ernest Cassel with\r\na verbal note in which England offered to remain neutral in case of\r\nan \"unprovoked\" attack upon Germany, provided Germany agreed to limit\r\nher naval construction program and to drop her new Naval bill, the\r\nlatter being darkly hinted at. Owing to our favorable answer to this\r\nLord Haldane was intrusted with the negotiations and sent to Berlin.\r\nThe negotiations finally fell through, owing to the constantly more\r\nuncompromising attitude of England (Sir E. Grey), who finally disavowed\r\nLord Haldane and withdrew his own verbal note, because Grey was afraid\r\nto offend the French by a German-English agreement and jeopardize the\r\nAnglo-French-Russian understanding.\r\n\r\nHere are the details of the case:\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 29, 1912, Herr Ballin had himself announced\r\nto me at the palace in Berlin and asked for an audience. I assumed that\r\nit was a case of a belated birthday greeting, therefore I was not a\r\nlittle astonished when Ballin, after a short speech of congratulation,\r\nsaid that he had come as an emissary of Sir Ernest Cassel, who had just\r\narrived in Berlin on a special mission and wished to be received.\r\n\r\nI asked whether it was a political matter, and why, if so, the meeting\r\nhad not been arranged through the English ambassador. Ballin's answer\r\nwas to the effect that, from hints dropped by Cassel, he knew the\r\nmatter to be of great importance, and the explanation for Cassel's\r\nacting without the intervention of the ambassador was because the\r\nearnest desire had been expressed in London that the official\r\ndiplomatic representatives, both the English and the German, should not\r\nbe apprised of the affair.\r\n\r\nI declared that I was ready to receive Cassel at once, but added that,\r\nshould his mission have to do with political questions, I should\r\nimmediately summon the Chancellor, since I was a constitutional monarch\r\nand not in a position to deal with the representative of a foreign\r\npower alone without the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nBallin fetched Cassel, who handed me a document which, he stated,\r\nhad been prepared with the \"approval and knowledge of the English\r\nGovernment.\" I read the short note through and was not a little\r\nsurprised to see that I was holding in my hand a formal offer\r\nof neutrality in case Germany became involved in future warlike\r\ncomplications, conditioned upon certain limitations in the carrying out\r\nof our program of naval construction, which were to be the subject of\r\nmutual conferences and agreements. Walking with Ballin into the next\r\nroom, I handed over the document for him to read. After he had done so\r\nboth of us exclaimed in the same breath: \"A verbal note!\"\r\n\r\nIt was plainly apparent that this \"verbal note\" was aimed at the\r\nforthcoming addition to our Naval law and designed in some way to delay\r\nor frustrate it. No matter how the matter was interpreted, I found\r\nmyself confronted with a peculiar situation, which also amazed Ballin.\r\nIt reminded me of the situation at Cronberg-Friedrichshof in 1905,\r\nwhen I was obliged to decline the demand, made to me personally by the\r\nEnglish Under Secretary, Hardinge, that we should forego our naval\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURPRISE AT BRITISH NOTE\r\n\r\nNow, an intimate business friend of Edward VII appears, without\r\nprevious announcement through official diplomatic channels, before the\r\nGerman Emperor with a \"verbal note\" inspired by the English Government,\r\nwith explicit instructions to evade all the diplomatic officials of\r\nboth countries. He hands over an offer from the English Government to\r\nmaintain neutrality in future warlike complications provided certain\r\nagreements regarding limitation of naval construction are made. And\r\nthis is done by England, the mother of \"Constitutionalism\"! When I\r\npointed this out to Ballin, he exclaimed: \"Holy Constitutionalism! What\r\nhas become of you? That is 'personal politics' with a vengeance!\"\r\n\r\nI agreed with Ballin to send at once for Herr von Bethmann, in order\r\nthat he might learn what was transpiring and decide what to do in this\r\npeculiar situation.\r\n\r\nBethmann was called up on the telephone and soon appeared. At first the\r\nsituation aroused in him likewise a certain degree of astonishment; it\r\nwas interesting to watch the play of expression on his face as he was\r\ntold about the matter. The Chancellor suggested that Grand Admiral von\r\nTirpitz also be summoned, for the proper dispatching of the business,\r\nand recommended that an answer be drawn up in English, in the same\r\nmanner and form as the note delivered by Cassel, and that it be handed\r\nto Sir Ernest, who wished to return home that night. (English was\r\nchosen because there was fear of obscurity and misunderstanding if the\r\nnote were translated in London.) The Chancellor asked me to draw up the\r\nnote, since I knew English best. After some objection I had to make up\r\nmy mind to be myself the writer of the answer.\r\n\r\nAnd now the following scene took place:\r\n\r\nI sat at the writing table in the adjutant's room; the other gentlemen\r\nstood around me. I would read a sentence from the note aloud and sketch\r\nout an answer, which was, in turn, read aloud. Then criticisms were\r\nmade from right and left: one thought the sentence too complaisant,\r\nanother too abrupt; it was thereupon remodeled, recast, improved, and\r\npolished. The Chancellor particularly subjected my grammar and style\r\nto much torture, owing to his habit of probing things philosophically,\r\nto his methods of profound thoroughness, which caused him to be most\r\nparticular with every word, in order that it, having been studied from\r\nevery angle, should later on afford nobody cause for criticism.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of work the note was finally finished and, having been\r\npassed a couple of times from hand to hand and then read aloud by me\r\nhalf a dozen times more, it was signed.\r\n\r\nWhen our group broke up, the Chancellor asked Sir Ernest who was to be\r\nexpected from England to conduct the negotiations. Cassel replied that\r\nit would certainly be a Minister, which one he did not know--perhaps\r\nMr. Winston Churchill, Minister of the Navy, since the question was\r\na naval one. Then the Chancellor arranged further with him that the\r\nunofficial method should be retained and that Ballin should undertake\r\nto transmit all the news regarding the matter which should emanate from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest expressed his lively gratitude for his cordial reception\r\nand his satisfaction at the tenor of our reply. Later Ballin informed\r\nme from his hotel that Cassel had expressed himself as completely\r\nsatisfied over the successful outcome of his mission, and that he would\r\nreport to his Government the good impression made upon him.\r\n\r\nWhen I thereupon conferred on the matter with Admiral von Tirpitz we\r\nboth agreed that the Naval bill was in danger and, therefore, that we\r\nmust be very careful.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIC PREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\nIn perfect secrecy the material was collected which Admiral von Tirpitz\r\nwas to present at the negotiations; it consisted of a short historical\r\nsketch of the development of the fleet and of the increasingly\r\ndifficult tasks devolving upon it; the Naval law and its aims, nature,\r\nenactment, and extension; finally, the contemplated Naval bill, its\r\nmeaning and the method of putting it through.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor asked that the main negotiations should be conducted\r\nat the palace in my presence. In addition, I agreed with Admiral von\r\nTirpitz that he should speak English, as far as possible, and that I,\r\nin case of difficult technical expressions, would interpret.\r\n\r\nUntil England made known the name of the negotiator, our time was spent\r\nin suppositions, and Ballin informed us of combinations in connection\r\nwith which a number of names, even that of Grey, came up.\r\n\r\nAt last the news arrived, through Ballin, that Haldane--the Minister of\r\nWar, previously a lawyer--had been intrusted with the conduct of the\r\nnegotiations and would soon arrive. General amazement! Just imagine,\r\n\"mutatis mutandis,\" that Germany had sent her Minister of War (at that\r\ntime von Heeringen) to London, instead of Admiral von Tirpitz, for the\r\ndiscussion of a naval matter!\r\n\r\nWhen this point was discussed with Bethmann and Tirpitz a number of\r\nsuppositions were advanced; the Chancellor said that Haldane was\r\nknown in England as a student of Goethe and as a man versed in German\r\nphilosophy and knowing the German language, so that his choice was\r\na piece of politeness toward us. Tirpitz observed that Haldane had\r\nformerly spent some time in Berlin and worked with General von Einem at\r\nthe War Ministry, and hence knew the state of affairs in Germany. I\r\nsuggested that all that was very well, but that the choice of Haldane\r\nshowed that England looked upon the question as purely political, since\r\nhe knew only superficially about naval affairs; that the whole thing\r\nwas probably directed against Germany's naval policy in general and the\r\nnew Naval bill in particular; that it would be well, therefore, not to\r\nforget this, in order that the whole thing might not develop into a\r\nforeign assault upon our right of self-determination as to the strength\r\nof our defensive measures.\r\n\r\nHaldane arrived and was received as an Imperial guest. Ballin, who\r\naccompanied him, solved the riddle of Haldane's choice on the basis of\r\ninformation received by him from England.\r\n\r\nHe said that when Cassel had got back to London, reported on his\r\nreception, and handed over the German reply, the impression made was\r\nso favorable that no further doubt was entertained there as to the\r\nsatisfactory course of the negotiations and their conclusion in the\r\nform of an agreement; that, thereupon a keen dispute had arisen among\r\nthe Ministers, especially between Churchill and Grey, as to who should\r\ngo to Berlin and affix his name to this great historical document, in\r\ncase the object should be achieved of making Germany completely give up\r\nthe further development of her fleet; that Churchill thought himself\r\nthe right man for the job, since he was at the head of the navy. But\r\nGrey and Asquith would not let their colleague reap the glory, and, for\r\nthis reason, Grey stood for a while in the foreground--another proof\r\nthat it was politics rather than the number of ships which was to play\r\nthe leading rôle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF CHURCHILL\r\n\r\nAfter a while, however, it was decided that it was more fitting\r\nto Grey's personal and official importance to appear only at the\r\ntermination of the negotiations, to affix his name to the agreement,\r\nand--as it was put in the information transmitted from England to\r\nBallin--\"to get his dinner from the Emperor and to come in for his part\r\nof the festivities and fireworks\"--which, in good German, means to\r\nenjoy the \"Bengal light illumination.\"\r\n\r\nAs it had been decided that Churchill was not to get this in any event,\r\nit was necessary to choose somebody for the negotiations who was close\r\nto Asquith and Grey and who, possessing their complete confidence, was\r\nwilling to conduct the negotiations as far as the beginning of the\r\n\"fireworks\"; one who, moreover, was already known at Berlin and not\r\na stranger in Germany. Churchill, to be sure, qualified in this, for\r\nhe had been present a few times at the Imperial maneuvers in Silesia\r\nand Württemberg as a guest of the Emperor. Ballin guaranteed the\r\nreliability of his London source of information.\r\n\r\nBefore the negotiations began I once more pointed out to Secretary of\r\nState von Tirpitz that Haldane, in spite of being just then Minister\r\nof War, probably had prepared himself for his task, and had surely\r\nreceived careful instructions from the English Admiralty, in which\r\nthe spirit of Fisher was paramount. In his _Handbook for English Naval\r\nOfficers_, Fisher had stated, among other precepts well worthy of being\r\nremembered, one which is characteristic of the Admiral, his department\r\nand its spirit, which runs, word for word, as follows: \"If you tell a\r\nlie, stick to it.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, I said to Tirpitz, we must not forget what an amazing\r\nadaptability the Anglo-Saxons had, which fitted them for occupying\r\npositions which had no relation to their previous life and training.\r\nFurthermore, the interest in England in the navy was generally so\r\nintense that almost every educated man was an expert up to a certain\r\npoint on naval questions.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the negotiations Haldane proved himself admirably\r\nwell informed and a skillful, tenacious debater, and his brilliant\r\nqualities as a lawyer came to the fore. The conversation lasted several\r\nhours, and brought about a general clarifying, as well as a preliminary\r\nagreement as to postponement of time limits of ship construction, etc.\r\nThe details concerning it are deposited in documents at the Imperial\r\nNaval Office. Tirpitz was splendid.\r\n\r\nAfter some more conferences--at which, likewise, Ballin was\r\npresent--Haldane returned to England. Ballin informed me that Haldane\r\nhad expressed himself to him as entirely satisfied with the outcome of\r\nhis mission, and had stated that in about a week or two the first draft\r\nof the agreement could be sent to us.\r\n\r\nTime passed--the date set for the introduction of the Naval bill\r\napproached. Tirpitz suggested, in case the agreement were concluded\r\npreviously, that the Naval bill be altered accordingly; otherwise, that\r\nit be introduced without alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSPECTS ENGLISH PURPOSES\r\n\r\nAt last we received, not the draft of the agreement, but a document\r\nasking all sorts of questions and expressing a desire for all sorts of\r\ndata, a reply to which required many consultations and much reflection.\r\nLittle by little the suspicion grew in me that the English were not in\r\nearnest with regard to the agreement, since question followed question\r\nand details were sought which had nothing directly to do with the\r\nagreement. England withdrew more and more from her promises, and no\r\ndraft of the agreement came to hand.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin a big agitation set in against the Naval bill, Tirpitz and\r\nmyself on the part of the Foreign Office, and from other quarters,\r\nboth qualified and unqualified. The Chancellor also, who hoped to\r\nachieve the agreement and affix his name to a document which would\r\nfree Germany from \"encirclement\" and bring her into a regular and\r\nbetter relationship with England, came out in favor of dropping the\r\nNaval bill. But that would simply have meant allowing a foreign\r\npower enormous influence in matters of German national defense and\r\njeopardizing thereby the national right of self-determination and\r\nour readiness for battle in case of a war being forced upon us. Had\r\nwe allowed this it would have amounted to our consenting to permit\r\nEngland, Germany's principal foe, to grant us whatever she wished,\r\nafter consulting her own interests, without receiving ourselves the\r\nguaranty of any equivalent concession.\r\n\r\nIn this confused state of affairs differences of opinion and violent\r\ndisputes arose, which, especially in those circles which really knew\r\nlittle about the navy, were conducted with much violence and not\r\nalways in a practical manner. Admiral von Tirpitz, all through that\r\nwinter, which was so hard a one for him and me, fought his fight like\r\na genuine, patriotic officer, realizing the situation and seeing\r\nthrough his opponents with clear vision and supporting me with complete\r\nconviction to the limit of his ability. All the Government officials\r\nagreed that no foreign country could be allowed any voice in helping\r\ndecide what we had or had not to do toward insuring our protection.\r\n\r\nThe hope of bringing about the agreement grew ever fainter; England\r\ncontinually showed lessening interest and kept eliminating important\r\nparts of her original verbal note. And so it came about that Admiral\r\nvon Tirpitz and I realized that the whole proposal was merely a\r\n\"maneuver.\"\r\n\r\nThe fight over the German Naval bill grew steadily hotter. I happened\r\nat this time to meet at Cuxhaven Doctor von Burchard, President of the\r\nHamburg Senate, whom I respected greatly, as he was the very model of\r\nan aristocratic citizen of a Hanseatic city, and who had often been\r\nconsulted by me in political matters. I described to him the entire\r\ncourse of the affair and the disputes in Berlin as to the introduction\r\nor nonintroduction of the bill, and asked him then to tell me, with his\r\nusual complete frankness, what he thought the right thing to do in the\r\ninterest of the national welfare, since I greatly desired to hear an\r\nobjective opinion, uninfluenced by the rival camps of Berlin.\r\n\r\nDoctor Burchard replied in his clear, keen, pointed, convincing\r\nmanner that it was my duty toward the people and the fatherland to\r\nstick to the bill; that whosoever spoke against its introduction was\r\ncommitting a sin against them; that whatever we thought necessary\r\nto our defense must be unconditionally brought into being; that,\r\nabove all else, we must never permit a foreign country to have the\r\npresumption to interfere with us; that the English offer was a feint\r\nto make us drop the Naval bill; that this must, in no circumstances,\r\nbe allowed; that the German nation would not understand why its\r\nright of self-determination had been sacrificed; that the bill must\r\nunquestionably be introduced; that he would work in its favor in the\r\nFederal Council (as indeed he did in a brilliant, compelling speech)\r\nand also otherwise press its acceptance in Berlin; that the English\r\nwould naturally resort to abuse, but that this made no difference,\r\nsince they had been doing so for a long time; that they certainly\r\nwould not get into a war for such a cause; that Admiral von Tirpitz\r\nwas merely doing his duty and fulfilling his obligations, and that\r\nI should support him in every way; that the Chancellor must give up\r\nopposing the measure, otherwise he would run the risk of finally\r\nforfeiting public esteem on account of being \"pro-English.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the representative of the great commercial city, which was\r\nthreatened before all others in case of war with England. The genuine\r\nHanseatic spirit inspired his words.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, this opinion of Doctor Burchard concerning the\r\nEnglish offer has recently been corroborated to me in Holland by a\r\nDutchman who heard from Englishmen at that time the English point of\r\nview. I and Tirpitz guessed right--the offer of neutrality, in case\r\nnaval expansion was curbed, was a political maneuver.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTERCHARGES OF CHEATING\r\n\r\nSoon news also came from Ballin that the matter was not going well in\r\nEngland: that, according to information received, a dispute had arisen\r\nabout the agreement; that there was dissatisfaction with Haldane, who,\r\nit was said, had let himself be cheated by Tirpitz! This was plain\r\nevidence of the indignation felt because Tirpitz had not walked into\r\nthe trap and simply let the bill drop, and that Haldane had been unable\r\nto serve up the bill to the English Cabinet on a platter at tea time.\r\nIt is useless to say that there was any \"cheating\" on Germany's part,\r\nbut the reproach leveled at Haldane justifies the suspicion that his\r\ninstructions were that _he_ should seek to \"cheat\" the Germans. Since\r\nhis fellow countrymen thought that the reverse was true, one can but\r\nthank Admiral von Tirpitz most sincerely for having correctly asserted\r\nthe German standpoint to the benefit of our fatherland.\r\n\r\nToward the end of March the fight about the bill took on such violence\r\nthat finally the Chancellor, on the 22d, asked me for his dismissal\r\nas I stepped out of the vault in the Charlottenburg Park. After long\r\nconsultation and after I had told him Doctor Burchard's view, the\r\nChancellor withdrew his request.\r\n\r\nWhen, some time afterward, I paid a visit to Herr von Bethmann in his\r\ngarden, I found him quite overcome and holding in his hand a message\r\nfrom London. It contained the entire disavowal of the verbal note\r\ndelivered by Cassel, the withdrawal of the offer of neutrality, as well\r\nas of every other offer, and at the end the advice that I dismiss Herr\r\nvon Bethmann from the Imperial Chancellorship, since he enjoyed to a\r\nmarked degree the confidence of the British Government! Tears of anger\r\nshone in the eyes of the Chancellor, thus badly deceived in his hopes;\r\nthe praise accorded to him by a foreign government with which Germany\r\nand he had just had such painful experiences hurt him deeply. For the\r\nsecond time he offered me his resignation; I did not accept it, but\r\nsought to console him. I then ordered that the ambassador in London be\r\nasked how he could have accepted and forwarded such a message under any\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nNow the Chancellor was in favor of the bill, but it was honorably\r\nproposed with the limitation which it had been decided to impose upon\r\nit in case of the conclusion of the agreement. In England, on the other\r\nhand, the full naval construction program was carried out.\r\n\r\nThis \"Haldane episode\" is characteristic of England's policy. This\r\nwhole maneuver, conceived on a large scale, was engineered for the\r\nsole purpose of hampering the development of the German fleet, while,\r\nsimultaneously, in America, which had an almost negligible merchant\r\nfleet; in France, whose navy was superior in numbers to the German; in\r\nItaly, in Russia, which also had ships built abroad--vast construction\r\nprograms were carried out without eliciting one word of protest from\r\nEngland. And Germany, wedged in between France and Russia, certainly\r\nhad to be at least prepared to defend herself on the water against\r\nthose nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENDS NAVAL PROGRAM\r\n\r\nFor this our naval construction program was absolutely necessary; it\r\nwas never aimed against the English fleet, four or five times as strong\r\nas ours, and assuring England's superiority and security, to equal the\r\nstrength of which no sensible man in Germany ever dreamed. We needed\r\nour fleet for coast defense and the protection of our commerce; for\r\nthis purpose the lesser means of defense, like U-boats, torpedo boats,\r\nand mines, were not sufficient. In addition the coast batteries on the\r\nBaltic were so antiquated and miserably equipped that they would have\r\nbeen razed within forty-eight hours by the massed fire of the heavy\r\nguns of modern battleships. Thus, our Baltic coast was practically\r\ndefenseless. To protect it the fleet was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Skagerrak (Jutland) battle has proved what the fleet meant and\r\nwhat it was worth. That battle would have meant annihilation for\r\nEngland if the Reichstag had not refused up to 1900 all proposals for\r\nstrengthening the navy. Those twelve lost years were destined never to\r\nbe retrieved.\r\n\r\nBefore we take our leave of Haldane I wish to touch upon another\r\nepisode in his activities. In 1906 he came, with the permission of\r\nthe German Government, to Berlin, to inform himself concerning the\r\nPrussian defense conditions, recruiting, General Staff, etc. He busied\r\nhimself at the Ministry of War, where the Minister, General von Einem,\r\npersonally gave him information. After about two or three weeks' work\r\nthere he returned, well satisfied, to England.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the outbreak of the World War, the \"pro-German\" Haldane,\r\nthe friend of Goethe, was boycotted and treated with such hostility\r\nthat he could no longer show himself in public, he had a defense\r\nwritten of his term of office as Minister of War by the well-known\r\nlittérateur and journalist, Mr. Begbie, entitled _Vindication of Great\r\nBritain_. Therein his services toward forming a regular General Staff\r\nand preparing the British army for the World War are placed in a\r\nbright light and emphasis is laid on the skill with which he utilized\r\nthe permission obtained from the Prussian War Ministry in order to\r\nlearn in Germany about military matters and to reorganize the British\r\narmy and General Staff, to the minutest detail and on the German model,\r\nfor the coming war against the erstwhile German hosts.\r\n\r\nHere we see the sly, adroit lawyer, who, sheltered under the\r\nhospitality of a foreign country, studies its military arrangements in\r\norder to forge weapons against it out of the material and knowledge\r\nthus acquired. Quite characteristically the book is dedicated to King\r\nEdward VII, whose intimate, emissary, and tool Haldane was. In those\r\ndays Berlin saw in Haldane's mission a \"rapprochement\" with England,\r\ntoward which Germans were always bending their efforts; in reality,\r\nhowever, it was a \"reconnoitering expedition\" under the very roof of\r\nthe German cousin. England showed her gratitude by the World War, which\r\nHaldane helped to prepare; in this case Haldane \"cheated\" the Germans!\r\n\r\nThat is the history of the Haldane mission. Later it was summarily\r\nmaintained by all sorts of ignorant dabblers in politics, belonging to\r\nthe press and the general public, that the promising \"rapprochement\"\r\nwith England through Haldane had been wrecked by the obstinacy of the\r\nEmperor and Admiral von Tirpitz and by their clinging to the Naval\r\nbill against the wishes of all \"sensible counselors!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGSHIP OF ALBANIA\r\n\r\nAt that time [in 1912] the question of the establishment of an\r\nindependent Albanian state and the choice by the Powers of a head for\r\nit, was brought to my attention also. A number of candidates lusting\r\nfor a crown had already presented themselves before the tribunal of the\r\nPowers, without getting themselves accepted; a number of candidates,\r\nconsidered by the Powers, were declined by the Albanians. I looked\r\nupon the matter in itself with indifference, and was of the opinion\r\nthat--as in the case of every \"creation of a nation\"--the greatest\r\npossible attention should be paid to historical development, also to\r\ngeographical peculiarities and the customs of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn this peculiar land there has never been any united nation under\r\none ruler and one dynasty. In valleys, encircled and cut off by high\r\nmountain ranges, the Albanian tribes live separated to a considerable\r\ndegree from one another. Their political system is not unlike the clan\r\nsystem of the Scotch. Christians and Mohammedans are represented in\r\nequal numbers.\r\n\r\nThe custom of \"vendetta\" is an ancient one, sanctified by tradition,\r\nwhich is no less true of robbery and cattle stealing. Agriculture is\r\nstill in a backward stage of development, farming is in its infancy,\r\nthe implements used therein date from before the flood.\r\n\r\nThe head man of the clan dispenses justice in the open, under the\r\nvillage tree, as it used to be done once upon a time among the ancient\r\nGermans. Every man is armed and most are excellent shots. Whenever the\r\nhead man of the clan turns up while on a horseback tour through his\r\nterritory in some hamlet, the inhabitants expect a blessing from him\r\nin the form of jingling coins, which sometimes are scattered about by\r\nhim from the saddle. This, of course, is particularly customary at the\r\noutset of a new Government's term, and great is the dissatisfaction\r\nwhen it does not happen.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Balkan War many Albanians entered the Turkish\r\nservice, where they rose to high importance, being greatly prized on\r\naccount of their diligence and keen intelligence, as well as their\r\ntenacious energy. They supplied the Turkish administration with a large\r\nnumber of officials, also with a certain percentage in the diplomatic\r\ncorps and the army. The young Albanian nobles were proud to serve in\r\na splendid company of palace guards of the Sultan, which scarcely had\r\nan equal for size, martial appearance, and manly beauty. These were\r\npartly relatives of the Sultan, since the latter used to have noble\r\nAlbanian women of the principal clans in his harem in order that\r\nhe--protected by blood brotherhood--might be safe from the \"vendettas\"\r\nof the clans, and, also, that he might find out everything that might\r\nserve to influence the feelings of the Albanian chieftains. The desires\r\nof the Albanians which reached him by this road--for instance, as to\r\nsupplies of arms and ammunition, school houses, building of highways,\r\netc.--were thereupon granted in an inconspicuous manner. Thus the\r\nSultan was enabled to keep the usually turbulent Albanians quiet and\r\nloyal by means of \"family ties.\"\r\n\r\nWith this knowledge of the state of affairs as a foundation, I sought\r\nto bring my influence to bear toward having a Mohammedan Prince chosen,\r\nif possible--perhaps an Egyptian Prince--not forgetting that he should\r\nhave a well-lined purse, which is an absolute necessity in Albania. My\r\nadvice was not heeded by the \"Areopagus of the Powers,\" whose members\r\nwere not bothering themselves with the interests of the Albanians,\r\nbut seeking, first of all, for pretexts and opportunities for fishing\r\nin the troubled Albanian waters in such a way as to benefit their own\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSED CHOICE OF GERMAN\r\n\r\nTherefore, I was not at all pleased when the choice fell upon Prince\r\nWilliam of Wied. I esteemed him as a distinguished, knightly man of\r\nlofty sentiments, but considered him unfitted for the post. The Prince\r\nknew altogether too little about Balkan affairs to be able to undertake\r\nthis thorny task with hope of success. It was particularly unpleasant\r\nto me that a German Prince should make a fool of himself there, since\r\nit was apparent from the start that the Entente would place all sorts\r\nof obstacles in his path. Upon being questioned by the Prince, I told\r\nmy cousin all my doubts, laying stress upon the difficulties awaiting\r\nhim, and advised him urgently to decline. I could not command him,\r\nsince the Prince of Wied, as head of the family, had the final word in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nAfter the Prince's acceptance of the candidacy offered him by the\r\nPowers, I received him in the presence of the Chancellor. A certain\r\nirresolution in the bearing of the Prince, who contemplated his new\r\ntask with anything but enthusiasm, strengthened the resolve in me and\r\nthe Chancellor to try hard once more to dissuade the young candidate\r\nfrom ascending the recently invented Albanian \"throne.\" But in vain.\r\nThe ambitious, mystically excited wife of the Prince saw in Albania the\r\nfulfillment of her wishes. And \"ce que femme veut, Dieu le veut\" (\"what\r\nwoman wishes, God wishes\").\r\n\r\nCarmen Sylva [the Queen of Rumania] also worked toward having him\r\naccept; she went so far, in fact, as to publish an article in the\r\nnewspapers beginning \"Fairyland Wants Its Prince.\"\r\n\r\nSo even the best meant warnings were useless. I had also strongly\r\nadvised the Prince not to go to Albania before the settlement of the\r\nfinancial question, since the reasons which had led me to suggest the\r\nselection of a rich ruler now came to the fore. The Prince was not very\r\nwealthy and the Powers had to supply him with a \"donation,\" concerning\r\nthe amount of which, and the method of paying it by installments, an\r\nunpleasant quarrel arose. At last a part payment was made.\r\n\r\nDanger lurked for the Prince and his eventual Government in the person\r\nof Essad Pasha, an unreliable, intriguing, greedy soldier of fortune,\r\nwho himself had designs on the Albanian throne and held sway over a\r\ncertain number of armed adherents. From the start he was an opponent\r\nof the new Prince and he plotted secretly with Italy, which was not\r\nfavorably inclined toward the Prince of Wied. Now, it would have been\r\nquite natural and a matter of course if the new ruler had taken with\r\nhim in his suite men from Germany whom he knew and who were faithful to\r\nhim. But he did not. An Englishman and an Italian were attached to his\r\nperson as \"secretaries\" and they had nothing better to do than to work\r\nagainst his interests, to give him bad advice and to intrigue against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS OF A RULER\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the Prince of Wied was making his preparations\r\nthe excellently written pamphlet of an Austrian General Staff officer,\r\ndealing with his travels in Albania, appeared. The officer described,\r\nin a lively and clear style, the geographical and climatic drawbacks,\r\nthe population and customs, the general poverty and backwardness of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that a future ruler of the land must in no circumstances\r\nreside on the coast, but must show himself to the inhabitants\r\nand travel about in the country. Owing to the primitive means of\r\ntransportation, he went on, the lord of the land must sit all day on\r\nhorseback and ride through his domain, having at his saddle bow the\r\nfamous \"bag of sequins\" mentioned in all Oriental tales and legends, in\r\norder to sway public opinion in his favor in the places visited by the\r\nexpected shower of gold. The ruler must be sure, the author continued,\r\nto bind some of the clans of the region closely to himself, so as to\r\nhave at his beck and call an armed force for asserting his will and\r\novercoming any opponents wishing to rebel, since this was the only way\r\nto maintain his power, in view of the utter lack of \"troops\" or an\r\n\"army\" in the European sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThis meant that the ruler of Albania must lead at first a nomadic,\r\nhorseback life, and, in addition, provide himself with a wandering\r\ncamp, with tents and other accessories and the necessary horses. Plenty\r\nof men adapted to this sort of life might have been found in his\r\nsquadron of the Third Guard Uhlan Regiment, since many of his Uhlans,\r\nwho were very fond of the Prince, had declared that they were ready to\r\naccompany him as volunteers. Surely, they would have served him better\r\nand been more useful to him than what he did in preparing to take over\r\nthe overlordship of Albania, without knowledge of the country.\r\n\r\nI advised my cousin urgently to study this pamphlet and to follow\r\nits recommendations, especially with regard to his residence, which\r\nshould be fixed at some point as far as possible from the warships of\r\nthe Powers, in order that he might not be forced to act under their\r\npressure and arouse suspicion among the Albanians that their ruler\r\nneeded these ships for protection against his subjects. Did the Prince\r\never read the pamphlet? In any event, the course adopted by him\r\nsubsequently was contrary to its advice and the advice given him by me.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and his wife journeyed to Albania, and things turned out\r\nas I had foreseen. According to reports describing the arrival of the\r\nsovereign couple, the Princess, although she was a German, addressed\r\nthe assembled Albanians from her balcony in French, since they\r\nunderstood no German! The \"court\" remained at Durazzo under the guns of\r\nthe foreign ships. The Prince did not travel on horseback through the\r\nland, nor did he scatter gold sequins about--not even from his balcony\r\non the day of his arrival--nor did he push Essad out of the way. So the\r\nadventure ended as one might imagine.\r\n\r\nI have gone into some detail in describing my opinion and attitude\r\ntoward the question of the choice of the ruler of Albania because,\r\nfrom every possible quarter, false rumors have been circulated for the\r\npurpose of imputing to me motives which were utterly foreign to me. In\r\nthis matter, also, I gave honest advice when questioned, based on sound\r\nknowledge of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe year 1912 also witnessed the meeting with the Tsar at\r\nBaltisch-Port, whither I repaired on board my yacht at the invitation\r\nof Nicholas II. Our two yachts anchored side by side, so that visiting\r\nfrom ship to ship was easy. The Tsar, his children, and his entire\r\nentourage vied with one another in evidences of good will and\r\nhospitality. The Russian and German escorting squadrons were inspected,\r\nturn and turn about, by the Tsar and myself together, and we took our\r\nmeals either at the Tsar's table or mine.\r\n\r\nWe spent one morning on land near Baltisch-Port. The Eighty-fifth\r\n\"Viborg\" Infantry Regiment, whose commander I was, had been drawn up in\r\na field and was inspected first in parade formation, then in company\r\nand battalion exercises, which were carried out in as satisfactory a\r\nmanner as was the parade with which the evolutions were brought to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe regiment, composed of four battalions, made an excellent\r\nimpression. It was in field equipment--brown-gray blouses and caps--and\r\nthe latter, worn jauntily cocked over one ear by all, gave to the\r\nsun-browned, martial faces of the strong young soldiers a bold air\r\nwhich brought joy to the heart of every soldier who gazed upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the brilliant and uncommonly amiable reception which\r\nI met with on this occasion I received no hint of the Balkan alliance,\r\nconcluded a short time before.\r\n\r\nIt was my last visit in Russia before the outbreak of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMy Co-workers in the Administration\r\n\r\n\r\nIt behooves me to remark that I found particular pleasure in working\r\nwith His Excellency von Stephan and in dealing with him. He was a man\r\nof the old school, who fitted in so well with me that he always grasped\r\nmy ideas and suggestions and afterward carried them out with energy\r\nand power, owing to his firm belief in them. A man of iron energy and\r\nunflagging capacity for work and joyousness; endowed, moreover, with\r\nrefreshing humor, quick to perceive new possibilities, never at a\r\nloss for expedients, well versed in political and technical matters,\r\nhe seemed to have been born especially for creative co-operation.\r\nI trusted him implicitly, and my trust in him was never betrayed.\r\nI learned much from my association with this stimulating, shrewd\r\ncounselor.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Office Department reached an unimagined degree of excellence\r\nand aroused the admiration of the whole world. The great invention of\r\nthe telephone was utilized to the limit, was applied extensively to the\r\npublic service, and was developed so as to facilitate it. Likewise in\r\nthe domain of building Stephan brought about a decided improvement,\r\nwhich received my approval and support.\r\n\r\nAll great state building projects depended on the vote of the\r\ninvestigating \"Academy of Building,\" which, at that time, was a\r\nslow-moving, cumbrous, and backward body. I had already had experiences\r\nof my own with it. The \"White Drawing Room,\" originally merely\r\nprovisional, had been put up without much attention to style--it had\r\nbeen intended at first for an Indian masquerade, a \"Lalla Rookh\"\r\nfestival, in honor of the Grand Duchess Charlotte, daughter of\r\nFrederick William III, and her husband, later Tsar Nicholas I. An\r\ninvestigation instituted at my order showed the material to be spurious\r\nand inferior; the structure was in the worst possible state of decay\r\nand in danger of collapse; a new one was needed.\r\n\r\nWith the co-operation and collaboration of the Empress Frederick,\r\nprojects and plans were made, and, finally, a big model was provided\r\nby Building Councilor Ihne--the \"modern Schlüter,\" as the Empress\r\nFrederick used to call him--which won unanimous approval. Only the\r\nBuilding Academy opposed wearisome objections, stating that the \"White\r\nDrawing Room\" ought to be preserved \"in its old historical beauty,\" and\r\nrequired no alterations. When the new structure was completed, however,\r\nit also met with the approval of the gentlemen who had been formerly so\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\nHerr von Stephan also was at loggerheads with the Academy of Building.\r\nHe wanted to alter many post offices, or build entirely new ones,\r\nespecially in the big cities, but, in view of the fearful slowness\r\nand devotion to red tape of the aforesaid official body, he used to\r\nreceive no answers at all, or else refusals, when he brought these\r\nmatters to its attention. The rule of thumb was supreme there. Herr\r\nvon Stephan was of the opinion that, in its buildings as well as in\r\nother directions, the youthful German Empire must give an impression of\r\npower, and that the Imperial post offices must be built accordingly;\r\nhe believed that they should harmonize with the general style of the\r\ntowns where they were located, or, at least, conform to the style of\r\nthe oldest and most important buildings there. Nor could I do otherwise\r\nthan agree with such a view.\r\n\r\n\r\nACADEMY'S SHACKLES BROKEN\r\n\r\nAt last there came a rupture with the aforementioned Academy. His\r\nExcellency von Stephan lost patience and informed me that he had freed\r\nhis office, and the buildings erected by it, from the supervision of\r\nthe Academy; that he had even formed a committee from among his own\r\narchitects and officials for supervising purposes; and that all he\r\nasked of me was to subject the more important plans for buildings to a\r\nfinal inspection. I did so willingly.\r\n\r\nStephan was an enthusiastic huntsman, so that I had additional\r\nopportunities, while on the court hunts, to enjoy association with this\r\nrefreshing, unchanging, faithful official and counselor.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ministers whom I particularly esteemed His Excellency Miquel\r\ntook first place. He it was who, as my Finance Minister, put through\r\nfor Prussia the great reform which placed the land on a sound basis and\r\nhelped it toward prosperity. Intercourse with this astute political\r\nexpert gave me great pleasure, and a wealth of teaching and stimulus.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which Miquel was versed in all possible matters was\r\nastounding. In conversation he was brisk, humorous, and keen in\r\nelucidating and arguing on a subject, in addition to which a strong\r\nhistorical bent ran, like a red thread, through his quotations. In\r\nhistory and ancient languages he was marvelously well equipped, so\r\nthat, in his reports, he was able often to hark back to the times\r\nof the Romans and quote from his store of knowledge--not out of\r\nBüchmann[7]--pieces of Latin in support of his arguments. Even when\r\nhe was instructing he was never tiresome on account of his brilliant\r\ndialectics, but used to hold his hearers spellbound to the very end.\r\n\r\nIt was His Excellency Miquel likewise who incited me to favor the\r\ngreat canal projects and supported me when the Prussian Conservatives\r\nopposed the Central [Rhine-Weser-Elbe] Canal, and caused the failure\r\nof the plan to build it. He lent strength to the King and made the\r\nlatter decide not to let up in this fight until victory was won. He\r\nknew, as I did, what blessings the canals in Holland and the splendid\r\ncanal network of France had brought to those lands and what a relief\r\nthey were to the ever more hard-pressed railways. In the World War we\r\nmight have had a splendid east-to-west artery of transportation for\r\nammunition, wounded, siege material, supplies, and the like, which\r\nwould have made it possible, by thus relieving the railways, for the\r\nlatter to transport troops on an even greater scale--moreover, this\r\nwould have lessened the shortage of coal. In time of peace also, for\r\nwhich the canal was destined, it would have been most beneficial.\r\n\r\nMinister von Miquel was a most ardent enthusiast for the Imperial\r\nGerman idea and the German Empire of the Hohenzollerns: I lent an\r\nattentive ear to his spirited handling of this theme. He was a man who,\r\nclinging to the old tradition, thought in a great German, Imperial way;\r\nhe was fully adequate to the requirements and demands of the new era,\r\nrightly appreciating when these were of value.\r\n\r\nFrom the start I concerned myself with the completion of the railway\r\nsystem. From the reports relating to national defense and the\r\ncomplaints of the General Staff, as well as from personal observation,\r\nI knew of the absolutely incredible neglect suffered by East Prussia in\r\nthe matter of railways. The state of affairs was absolutely dangerous,\r\nin view of the steady, though gradual, reinforcing of the Russian\r\ntroops facing our frontier, and the development of the Russian railway\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of his reign Emperor William the Great had\r\ncommanded Field Marshal Moltke to report on the situation, since the\r\nRussian armies, under the influence of France, were being posted\r\never more conspicuously on the eastern frontier of Prussia, arousing\r\napprehension as to the possibility of irruptions of great masses of\r\nRussian cavalry into Prussia, Posen, and Silesia. Quartermaster-General\r\nCount Waldersee and I were present at the reading of this report. From\r\nit came the resolve to shift Prussian troops eastward and to push\r\ntoward completion the neglected railway system.\r\n\r\nThe measures ordained by Emperor William I and begun by him required\r\ntime, particularly as the new railway bridges over the Vistula and\r\nNogat had to be built by the military authorities in the teeth\r\nof strong official opposition (Maybach). Since the railways were\r\nconsidered a \"national pocketbook,\" there was a desire to build only\r\n\"paying\" lines, which caused prejudice against outlays for military\r\nlines designed for the defense of the fatherland, since it diminished\r\nthe fine surplus funds by which such great store was laid.\r\n\r\nNot until my reign were the plans of Emperor William I brought to\r\nrealization. Anyone taking up a railway map of 1888 will be amazed\r\nat the lack of railway connection in the east, particularly in East\r\nPrussia, especially if he compares it with a 1914 map showing the\r\ndevelopment in the intervening years. If we had had the old network,\r\nwe should have lost our eastern territory in 1914.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, Minister von Maybach rendered valuable services in the\r\npromotion and development of the railway system. He had to take into\r\naccount the wishes and demands of the rapidly developing industrial\r\nsections of Western Germany, in doing which he naturally considered\r\nmilitary desires also, as far as he could. But during his régime\r\nEastern Germany was very badly treated with regard to railway lines,\r\nbridges, and rolling stock. Had there been mobilization at that time,\r\nit would have been necessary to transfer hundreds of locomotives to the\r\neast in order to maintain schedules capable of meeting even part of\r\nthe requirements of the General Staff. The only means of communication\r\nwith the east were the two antiquated trestle bridges at Dirschau and\r\nMarienburg. The General Staff became insistent, which brought quarrels\r\nbetween it and Maybach.\r\n\r\nNot until Minister Thielen came into office was there a change,\r\noccasioned by his self-sacrificing work, for which thanks are due him.\r\nRealizing correctly what the military requirements were, he pushed\r\nforward the completion of the eastern railways. Thielen was an able,\r\ndiligent, thoroughly reliable official of the old Prussian type,\r\nfaithful to me and enjoying my high esteem. In common with Miquel, he\r\nstood faithfully by the side of his sovereign in the fight for the\r\nCentral Canal. Characteristic of him were the words which he said in\r\nmy presence, before a big assembly of people, at the opening of the\r\nElbe-Trave Canal: \"The Central Canal must and will be built.\" Relations\r\nbetween him and me remained harmonious until his retirement.\r\n\r\nDespite the railway construction work in the western part of Germany,\r\nthere were in that region likewise serious gaps in the network of\r\nrailways, from the point of view of mobilization and deployment of\r\ntroops, which had long since needed remedying. The Rhine, as far up\r\nas Mainz, was crossed by one railway bridge only; the Main could be\r\ncrossed only at Frankfort. For a long time the General Staff had been\r\ndemanding the remedying of these conditions. Fortunately, general\r\ntraffic moved in the same direction--for instance, if a traveler coming\r\nfrom the west wished to reach one of the watering places in the Taunus\r\nMountains, or some place on the railway along the right bank of the\r\nRhine, he had to go as far as Frankfort, and then return in the same\r\ndirection whence he had come, although at Mainz he had almost been\r\nopposite Wiesbaden.\r\n\r\nMinister Budde was the man chosen for the accomplishment of this work.\r\nAs chief of the railway department of the General Staff he had long\r\nsince attracted my attention by his extraordinary capacity for work,\r\nhis energy, and his promptness in making decisions. He had often\r\nreported to me on the gaps in our railway system, which would hamper\r\nquick deployment of troops on two fronts, and always pointed out the\r\npreparations being made by Russia and France, which we were in duty\r\nbound to meet with preparations of equal scope, in the interests of the\r\nnational defense.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration, of course, in railway construction had been\r\nthe improvement and facilitation of industry and commerce, but it had\r\nnot been able to meet the immeasurably increased demands of these,\r\nsince the great network of canals, designed to relieve the railways,\r\nwas not in existence. The war on two fronts, which threatened us more\r\nand more--and for which our railways were, technically speaking, not\r\nyet ready, partly from financial-technical reasons--made necessary that\r\nmore careful attention should be paid to military requirements. Russia\r\nwas building, with French billions, an enormous network of railways\r\nagainst us, while in France the railways destined to facilitate the\r\ndeployment of forces against Germany were being indefatigably extended\r\nby the completion of three-track lines--something as yet totally\r\nunknown in Germany.\r\n\r\nMinister Budde set to work without delay. The second great railway\r\nbridge over the Rhine at Mainz was constructed, likewise the bridge\r\nover the Main at Costheim, and the necessary switches and loops for\r\nestablishing communication with the line along the right bank of the\r\nRhine, and with Wiesbaden; also the triangle at Biebrich-Mosbach was\r\ncompleted. Budde's talents found brilliant scope in the organization\r\nand training of the railway employees, whose numbers had grown\r\nuntil they formed a large army, and in his far-sighted care for his\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\nI respected this vigorous, active man with all my heart, and deeply\r\nregretted that a treacherous ailment put an end to his career in the\r\nvery midst of his work.\r\n\r\nIn His Excellency von Breitenbach I acquired a new and valuable aid\r\nand co-worker in my plans regarding the railways. In the course of\r\nyears he developed into a personage of high eminence. Distinguished and\r\nobliging, of comprehensive attainments, keen political insight, great\r\ncapacity for work and untiring industry, he stood in close relationship\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nHis co-operation with the General Staff in military matters was due\r\nto his thorough belief in the necessity of strengthening our means\r\nof defense against possible hostile attacks. Plans were made for the\r\nconstruction of three new Rhine bridges, at Rüdesheim, Neuwied, and\r\nthe Loreley, which were not completed until during the war--they\r\nwere named, respectively, after the Crown Prince, Hindenburg, and\r\nLudendorff. In the east, great extensions of railway stations, bridges,\r\nand new railway lines were built, some of them while the war was in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nOther important works carried out by Breitenbach in the west were the\r\ngreat railway bridge at Cologne, to replace the old trestle bridge; a\r\nnew bridge, by the Beyen Tower, for freight traffic; and new railways\r\nin the Eiffel Mountains. Moreover, at my special suggestion, a through\r\nline was built from Giessen to Wiesbaden, which included reconstruction\r\nof the stations at Homburg and Wiesbaden and the building of a loop\r\naround Frankfort and Höchst. In addition, trains were provided with\r\nthrough cars from Flushing to the Taunus.\r\n\r\nTo show that it is impossible to please everybody, I wish to observe\r\nin passing that we were violently attacked by the hotel proprietors of\r\nFrankfort, who were naturally not at all pleased at this elimination of\r\nFrankfort and of the necessity, existing previously, for passengers to\r\nchange trains there, since they lost thereby many customers formerly\r\nobliged to spend a night in some Frankfort hotel. This element brought\r\nparticularly strong opposition to bear against the loop line around\r\nHöchst.\r\n\r\nThe battle concerning the Central Canal was decided at last in favor of\r\nmy plans. Under Breitenbach, construction on it was pushed forward by\r\nsections with great energy. Those portions of this canal which it had\r\nbeen possible to place in operation have fully met expectations.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, also, the extraordinarily difficult extension and\r\ndeepening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, almost equivalent to building\r\nan entirely new waterway, was brought to completion, likewise the\r\ngreat Emden sea lock. These were remarkable achievements in the domain\r\nof bridge and lock construction, which aroused the admiration of the\r\nworld; in the matter of locks, for instance, those built at this time\r\nfar surpassed the locks of the Panama Canal in size. The difficult\r\ntasks were brilliantly and thoroughly completed by the officials in\r\ncharge; in so far as the construction work was in the hands of the\r\nEmpire, it was carried out mostly with the supervising co-operation of\r\nthe Prussian Ministry of Transportation.\r\n\r\nI often went to Breitenbach's home, where I had an opportunity, thanks\r\nto him, of having interesting talks on commercial-political and\r\neconomic subjects with a highly intelligent circle, of meeting a lot of\r\neminent men and discussing important questions. The plans and sketches\r\nof all the larger railway stations, locks, and bridges were submitted\r\nto me before the work of building or rebuilding them was begun, and\r\nreports concerning them were made to me.\r\n\r\nI have intentionally gone into detail in this matter in order to\r\nshow the following: First, how a monarch can and must influence the\r\ndevelopment of his realm by personal participation; second, how, if\r\nhe makes his selections quite independently of party reasons, he can\r\nplace able men at the head of the various departments; third, how, by\r\nthe honest co-operation of these men with the sovereign, whose complete\r\nconfidence they enjoy, brilliant results can be achieved. Everything\r\nthat we did together was aboveboard and honest; nothing mattered but\r\nthe welfare and development of the fatherland, its strengthening and\r\nequipment for competition in the world market.\r\n\r\nAs was natural, I had close and lasting relations in the regular course\r\nof events with the Ministry of Public Worship and Instruction. Herr\r\nvon Gossler and Herr von Trott may surely be considered the most\r\nimportant and prominent occupants of this post. In this Ministry a\r\nco-worker almost without equal arose in the person of Ministry Director\r\nAlthoff, a man of genius.\r\n\r\nI had been made acquainted with the dark side of the high-school\r\nsystem of education by my own school experiences. The predominantly\r\nphilological character of the training led, in the whole educational\r\nsystem as well, to a certain one-sidedness.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at the Cassel High School in 1874-77 I had observed that,\r\nalthough there was great enthusiasm for 1870-71 and the new Empire\r\namong the boys, there was, nevertheless, a distinct lack of the right\r\nconception of the German idea, of the feeling \"civis Germanus sum\"\r\n(\"I am a German citizen\")--which I impressed later upon my people at\r\nthe laying of the foundation-stone of the Saalburg. To create such\r\nsentiments and awaken them in the rising generation and to lay the\r\nfoundations for them firmly in the young hearts was a task somewhat\r\nbeyond the powers of the teaching staff, in view of the fossilized,\r\nantiquated philological curriculum.\r\n\r\nThere was great neglect in the department of German history, which\r\nis exactly the study through which young hearts may be made to\r\nglow, through which the love of one's native country, its future\r\nand greatness, may be aroused. But little was taught of more recent\r\nhistory, covering the years since 1815. Young philologists were\r\nproduced, but no German citizens qualified for practical co-operation\r\ntoward building up the flourishing young Empire.\r\n\r\nIn other words, no _youths who were consciously Germans_ were being\r\nturned out. In a small reading club composed of my classmates I often\r\ntried to inculcate the idea of the Greater Germany, in order to\r\neliminate parochial and similar conceptions which hampered the German\r\nidea. Admiral Werner's _Book of the German Fleet_ was one of the few\r\nworks by means of which the living feeling for the German Empire could\r\nbe fanned into flame.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that struck me, in addition to the one-sidedness of the\r\neducation in the schools, was the tendency, among youths planning their\r\ncareers in those days, to turn their attention to becoming Government\r\nofficials, and always consider the profession of lawyer or judge the\r\nmost worthy goal.\r\n\r\nThis was doubtless due to the fact that the conditions obtaining in the\r\nPrussia of olden days still had their effect in the youthful German\r\nEmpire. As long as the state consisted, so to speak, of government and\r\nadministration, this tendency among German youths in the shaping of\r\ntheir lives was understandable and justified; since we were living in\r\na country of officials, the right road for a young man to select was\r\nthe service of the state. British youths of that time, self-reliant and\r\nmade robust by sports, were already talking, to be sure, of colonial\r\nconquests, of expeditions to explore new regions of the earth, of\r\nextending British commerce; and they were trying, in the guise of\r\npioneers of their country, to make Great Britain still stronger and\r\ngreater, by practical, free action, not as paid hirelings of the state.\r\nBut England had long been a world empire when we were still a land of\r\nofficials; therefore, the youth of Britain could seek more remote and\r\nimportant goals than the German.\r\n\r\nNow that Germany had entered into world economics and world politics,\r\nhowever, as a by no means negligible factor, the aspirations of\r\nGerman youth should have undergone a more prompt transformation. For\r\nthis reason it was that I, during the later years of my reign, used\r\nto compare, with a heavy heart, the proud young Britons, who had\r\nlearned much less Latin and Greek than was required among us, with the\r\nchildren of Germany, pale from overstudy. To be sure, there were even\r\nthen enterprising men in Germany--brilliant names can be cited among\r\nthem--but the conception of serving the fatherland, not by traveling\r\nalong a definite, officially certified road, but by independent\r\ncompetition, had not yet become sufficiently generalized. Therefore I\r\nheld up the English as an example, for it seems to me better to take\r\nthe good where one finds it, without prejudice, than to go through the\r\nworld wearing blinkers.\r\n\r\nWith these considerations as a basis I won for my German youths the\r\n_School Reform_ against desperate opposition from the philologists,\r\ninside and outside the Ministry and school circles. Unfortunately, the\r\nreform did not take the shape which I hoped, and did not lead to the\r\nresults which I had expected.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic idea in all its splendor was first revealed and preached\r\nto the astonished German people by Chamberlain in his _Foundations\r\nof the Nineteenth Century_. But, as is proved by the collapse of the\r\nGerman people, this was in vain. To be sure, there was much singing of\r\n\"Deutschland über alles,\" but Germans, obeying the commands of their\r\nenemies, allowed the Emperor to fall and the Empire to be broken to\r\npieces; and, placing themselves under the orders of Russian criminals\r\nvastly inferior to them in culture, they stabbed their own army in the\r\nback while it was still fighting valiantly.\r\n\r\nHad Germans of all classes and conditions been educated to feel joy and\r\npride in their fatherland, such a degradation of a great nation would\r\nhave been unimaginable.\r\n\r\nThis degradation--which, it must be admitted, occurred under\r\nremarkable, extremely difficult circumstances--is all the more\r\ndifficult to understand in view of the fact that the youth of Germany,\r\nalthough it was impaired in health by overstudy, and not so toughened\r\nby sports as the English, achieved brilliant feats in the World War,\r\nsuch as were nowhere equaled before.\r\n\r\nThe years 1914-18 showed what might have been made out of the German\r\npeople had it only developed its admirable qualities in the right\r\ndirection. The 4th of August, 1914, the heroes of Langemark, countless\r\nsplendid figures from all classes, rise up from the chaos of the long\r\nwar to show what the German can do when he throws away Philistinism and\r\ndevotes himself, with the enthusiasm which so seldom reveals itself\r\ncompletely in him, to a great cause. May the German people never forget\r\nthese incarnations of its better self; may it emulate them with its\r\nfull strength by inculcating in itself the true German spirit!\r\n\r\nIn the post of Minister of Justice I found His Excellency Friedberg,\r\nthe intimate, faithful friend of my father, whom I had known ever since\r\nmy youth, when he was a welcome guest in the home of my parents. This\r\nsimple, affable man enjoyed with me the same consideration which had\r\nbeen shown him by my parents.\r\n\r\nIn later years I had frequent and welcome dealings with His Excellency\r\nBeseler, who also enabled me to hear informal discussion at his house\r\nof many an interesting legal problem by prominent lawyers, and to come\r\ninto touch with legal luminaries. I felt no particular inclination\r\ntoward the lawyers in themselves--since pedantry, remoteness from\r\nactualities and doctrinaire leanings often assert themselves in the\r\ndomain of the law altogether too much for my taste--but the compilation\r\nof the _Citizens' Law Book_ interested me greatly. I was present at\r\nsessions dealing with it, and was proud that this fundamental German\r\nwork should have been brought to completion in my reign.\r\n\r\nWhen I met the Lord Chief Justice of England, while I was on a visit to\r\nthat country, at the home of Lord Haldane, I asked that great jurist\r\nwhat he thought of the administration and interpretation of the law\r\nin Germany. His answer ran thus: \"You pronounce judgment too much\r\naccording to the letter of the law; we according to the spirit and\r\ncontent of the law.\"\r\n\r\nI have often pointed out how unfortunate it was that we have not been\r\nable to introduce, in police cases--connected with traffic, streets,\r\netc.--the prompt procedure of the English \"police court.\" For, in\r\nEngland, punishment in such cases is meted out on the very next day,\r\nwhereas in Germany months often elapse, what with gathering of evidence\r\nand examination of witnesses, until, finally, some insignificant\r\nsentence is pronounced long after the case has been forgotten. I should\r\nalso have liked to introduce into Germany the heavy penalties for\r\nlibels published in the press which are customary in England.\r\n\r\nI have often pointed out how unfortunate it was Prince, with Minister\r\nof Finance Scholz, and had taken part in sessions wherein that famous\r\nman, His Excellency Meinecke, figured. Meinecke was Under Secretary of\r\nState in the Finance Ministry and had, therefore, much to do with other\r\nMinisters, since finances were an important thing everywhere. He had\r\nachieved a certain degree of fame because he--as he thought--was always\r\nable smilingly to find the best way out of tight places.\r\n\r\nScholz was faithful to his duty and able, but he did not succeed in\r\nmaking the dry substance of taxes and the like particularly interesting\r\nand pleasant to me, nor was there any change in this state of affairs\r\nuntil the versatile Miquel took charge of the Finance Ministry. When\r\nMiquel reported to me concerning the Prussian financial reform, he\r\nsuggested three plans: one modest, one medium, one ambitious. To the\r\ndelight of the Minister I decided, without hesitation, for the third.\r\nBoth the monarch and the Minister were filled with satisfaction when\r\nthe reform was carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of the Interior, Herr von Puttkamer, had been forced to\r\nretire during the ninety-nine days, to the great sorrow of him who was\r\nthen Crown Prince. He was an able, tried old Prussian official; one\r\nof those Pomeranians of the old school, filled with loyalty to the\r\nKing--a nobleman through and through. Rumor had it that the Empress\r\nFrederick had driven him from office by a plot, but this is not true.\r\nThe Empress, with her inclination to English Liberalism, doubtless did\r\nnot like the old-time Prussian Conservative, yet she was not at all to\r\nblame for his going. Prince Bismarck pushed him aside, perhaps out of\r\nconsideration for the Empress Frederick.\r\n\r\nI was deeply interested in forestry and its improvement along practical\r\nlines, especially as new gold reserves could be created for the state\r\nby reforestation.\r\n\r\nNext to Herr von Podbielski, the ablest Minister of Agriculture and\r\nForests was Freiherr von Schorlemer. Just as Herr von Podbielski\r\nbent his efforts toward creating great stretches of forests in the\r\neast, in order to keep off the east wind by a compact forest zone and\r\nthus improve our climate, and, at the same time, provide a natural\r\nprotection against Russian attacks, so Herr von Schorlemer opened up\r\nthe eastern forest reservations by extensive construction of roads, and\r\nby thus facilitating the transportation of wood helped Germany greatly\r\nin making headway in competition against wood from Russia.\r\n\r\nBoth Ministers sought, in co-operation with me, to improve our splendid\r\nPrussian forestry personnel and better living conditions among them,\r\nand to help toward promotions in their ranks--all of which these\r\nofficials, zealous in their work and faithful to their King, fully\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nThe influx of large sums into the state's pocketbook depended indeed\r\non the honesty, industry, and reliability of these men. I expected\r\nmuch toward the restoration of the fatherland from the statesmanlike\r\nshrewdness and ability of Herr von Schorlemer, who was always quite\r\nconscious of the goal at which he was aiming.[8]\r\n\r\nI learned much about forestry from Head Foresters Freiherr von\r\nHövel (Joachimsthal, Schorfheide) and Freiherr Speck von Sternburg\r\n(Szittkohnen, Rominten) on my many hunting expeditions with these\r\nexcellent huntsmen and administrators.\r\n\r\nLet me say a word here regarding a Russian curiosity in the domain of\r\npreserving wild game. The Tsar, who had heard a great deal about the\r\nfine antlers of the stags at Rominten, wished to have some of the same\r\nsort at Spala, in Poland. Freiherr von Sternburg was sent to the Spala\r\nhunting lodge one summer in order to give advice regarding this project.\r\n\r\nHe was received very cordially by a general, who had charge of the\r\nhunting there and lived at the lodge. Sternburg noticed that all the\r\napartments, even those not inhabited, were always kept heated. When he\r\nspoke of the enormous waste of wood occasioned by this, the general\r\nshrugged his shoulders and remarked that one never could tell, the Tsar\r\nmight put in an appearance some day, after all. A gamekeeper, who was a\r\nGerman, was assigned to Sternburg, since the general did not know his\r\nway about on the reservation and was quite ignorant of game feeding.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his tours about the place Sternburg observed a number\r\nof places where meadows could be turned into pastures or good feeding\r\nplaces could be installed. He drew attention to the need of such\r\narrangements, having noticed that the deer had already begun to shed\r\ntheir horns to a considerable extent, thereby causing much damage to\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nBut the gamekeeper shook his head sadly and remarked that he had\r\nalready reported all that, but in vain, since the hay for the deer\r\nhad to be brought by rail from the Black Sea and the shipments\r\nsometimes either did not arrive at all or were greatly delayed and\r\narrived spoiled. But nothing would be done to alter this, continued\r\nthe gamekeeper, since too many people made a good thing out of this\r\ntransporting of the hay, which was paid for at huge prices.\r\n\r\nHe also told how--after he had called attention to the many splinters\r\nof wood found in the intestines of the deer, in order to prove\r\nthat they were insufficiently fed and that feeding places must be\r\nprovided--a committee of animal doctors had been brought from St.\r\nPetersburg to investigate the matter. The said committee lived and ate\r\nfor weeks in Spala at the Tsar's expense, shot many deer, examined\r\nthem, and held sessions; and the upshot of all this was a report that\r\nthe animals had wood in their stomachs, which proved that they could\r\nlive on wood, for which reason feeding places would be superfluous and\r\nthe hay from the Black Sea would suffice to supplement the wood. And\r\nthere the matter remained, in spite of Sternburg's visit!\r\n\r\nWhen I heard this yarn, I involuntarily thought of an anecdote which\r\nPrince Bülow especially delighted to tell in connection with his\r\nsojourn at St. Petersburg. While there, he had attended the salon of\r\nMadame Durnovo, where society used often to gather. One day a prominent\r\ngeneral was complaining to the hostess that he had been trapped in a\r\nmoney matter, which had brought him much unpleasantness from \"above.\"\r\nApparently he wished, by his mournful description, to arouse sympathy\r\nfor his bad luck, but Madame Durnovo retorted, in her rough way: \"Mon\r\ncher Général, quand on fait des sâletés, il faut qu'elles réussissent!\"\r\n(\"My dear General, when you play dirty tricks it is necessary that they\r\nbe successful!\")\r\n\r\nAs Secretary of State in the Imperial Postal Department likewise, Herr\r\nvon Podbielski, after I had chosen him and declined a number of other\r\ncandidates, did excellent work, treading worthily in the footsteps of\r\nStephan. Very practical; endowed with the business sense and a great\r\nknowledge of business; well versed and clever in financial matters; of\r\ninnate administrative talent, and, at the same time, quick to fight;\r\ncaustically witty; a good speaker and debater--he worked with zeal and\r\nskill, often as a pioneer, particularly in matters of world postal\r\nservice, wireless telegraphy, etc. This former colonel in the Ziethen\r\nHussars made a name for himself in the service of his fatherland which\r\nwill never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAn amusing contrast to his career is that of a Russian Hussar officer\r\nunder Nicholas I. This Tsar, being full of anger against the Holy\r\nSynod, had driven away the man at the head of it. Shortly afterward\r\nhe inspected the Hussar Body Guard Regiment, commanded by Colonel\r\nCount Protassoff. The immense satisfaction of the Tsar at the splendid\r\nappearance and maneuvering of the fine regiment found expression\r\nin the words, amazing alike to the commander and his men: \"Thou\r\nhast maneuvered thy regiment magnificently, and, as a token of my\r\nsatisfaction, I name thee Procurator of the Holy Synod, which thou must\r\nput into good shape for me!\"\r\n\r\nMention must be made here of another excellent and worthy man, Minister\r\nMöller. He came from Bielefeld, like Hinzpeter, and was bound to my\r\nold teacher by lasting ties of friendship. In the legislature he was\r\none of the leaders of the National Liberals, by whom he was highly\r\nesteemed, as he was in the Reichstag, on account of his upright,\r\ndistinguished Westphalian characteristics and his great experience in\r\nthe commercial-political domain.\r\n\r\nWhen Imperial Chancellor Bülow suggested Möller to me as Minister I\r\nremarked that he was a party man and member of the Reichstag. The\r\nChancellor said that the National Liberals would be pleased at Möller's\r\nappointment. I observed that the state Ministry of the Prussian King\r\ncould not and must not be a party Ministry, but must stand above\r\nthe parties in entire independence of them; that I esteemed Möller\r\npersonally very much, but, should he become Minister, every member\r\nof the legislature would have the ambition to become one likewise;\r\nthat, through Möller's appointment, the ambitions of the other parties\r\nto obtain ministerial chairs would also be aroused and nobody could\r\nforesee the consequences; that, moreover, Möller would be greatly\r\nmissed in the Reichstag, from which I did not wish to take him on\r\naccount of his influence with all parties.\r\n\r\nDespite these objections and my advice against it, Bülow stuck to his\r\nidea. Möller became Minister, and, as such, stood very well with me.\r\nBut what I had prophesied occurred comparatively soon: Minister Möller\r\nwas obliged to retire by circumstances partially connected with the\r\ninner workings of his party.\r\n\r\n  [7] A German philologist who compiled a well-known book of quotations.\r\n\r\n  [8] His recent death, which snatched him away in the midst of\r\n      beneficial labors, is a serious loss to the fatherland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nScience and Art\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad and many-sided field whose care devolved upon the Ministry\r\nof Public Worship and Instruction--embracing art, science, research,\r\nmedical matters, etc.--always aroused my lively interest and enlisted\r\nmy efforts in its behalf.\r\n\r\nSpecial pleasure was afforded me by the development of the Technical\r\nHigh School. The increasing importance of technical matters drew ever\r\nlarger numbers of the ablest youths to institutions of learning of this\r\ndescription, and the achievements of the teachers there and of the\r\nyoung engineers who were graduated constantly brought new laurels to\r\nthe German name.\r\n\r\nAmong the teachers at Charlottenburg one of the most prominent and best\r\nknown all over the world was Professor Doctor Slaby. Until his death\r\nhe had constant dealings with me and kept me informed concerning the\r\nnewest inventions by means of captivating discourses. These were given\r\nnot only in his laboratory, but also in the quiet hunting lodge in the\r\nforests of Brandenburg, where I, together with the Empress, surrounded\r\nby a few intimates, used to listen eagerly to Slaby's words. Slaby was\r\nalso dear to me as an individual and caused me much mental enjoyment by\r\nhis simple, clear views on every possible sort of thing in this world,\r\nwhich he could always express in the most stimulating and enthralling\r\nmanner. Slaby meant much to me, and I felt grateful affection for him\r\nup to the time of his death.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the achievements of the technical high schools and of\r\nsuch men as Slaby, Intze, and so on, I resolved to grant the high\r\nschools the same privilege of representation in the Prussian upper\r\nhouse as was enjoyed by the universities. But the universities\r\nprotested vehemently against this to the Minister of Public Worship\r\nand Instruction, and there ensued a violent fight against the\r\nclassical-scientific arrogance of the savants, until I finally enforced\r\nmy will by a decree. Slaby received the news from me by telegraph in\r\nhis laboratory while he was delivering a lecture, and gave it to the\r\nstudents, who burst into wild cheers. The technical high schools have\r\nshown themselves worthy of the honor conferred upon them.\r\n\r\nIn view of the constantly more violent fight for the markets of the\r\nworld and its outlets, it became necessary, in order to utilize the\r\nwisdom of the leaders of German science in this direction, to provide\r\nthem with more freedom, quiet, possibility for working, and materials.\r\nMany savants of importance were hampered in research work by their\r\nactivities as teachers, so that the only time they had left over for\r\nresearch was their vacation. This state of affairs resulted in overwork\r\nand overburdening, which had to be stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL RESEARCH\r\n\r\nAttention was turned first to improvements in the domain of chemistry.\r\nMinister von Trott and Director of the Ministry Althoff, having grasped\r\nthe state of affairs with clear understanding, made possible for me the\r\nestablishment of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and drew up the statutes\r\ngoverning it. In the short time of its existence it has achieved\r\nbrilliant results and given me an opportunity, at its general meetings,\r\nto become acquainted with eminent men in all branches of knowledge with\r\nwhom I thereafter entered into regular intercourse. I also visited\r\ntheir laboratories, where I could follow the progress of their labors.\r\nNew laboratories were founded, others subsidized from the contributions\r\nof the senate and members of the organization.\r\n\r\nI was proud of this creation of mine, since it proved a boon to the\r\nfatherland. The inventions due to the research of its members benefited\r\nthe entire nation. It was a peace-time achievement with a great and\r\nmost promising future, which, under the guidance of Herr von Trott, was\r\nin most excellent hands; unfortunately, the war robbed me of this joy,\r\nalong with all others. Nowadays I must do without the intercourse with\r\nmy men of learning of my association, and that is a cruel blow to me.\r\nMay it continue to live and labor for the benefit of research and the\r\ngood of the fatherland!\r\n\r\nI had to face a severe fight in getting Professor Harnack summoned to\r\nBerlin. The theologians of the Right and the Orthodox element protested\r\nvehemently. After I had again obtained full information from Hinzpeter\r\nand he had closed his opinion with the words that it would be most\r\nregrettable for Berlin and Prussia if I backed down, I insisted upon\r\nthe summoning of Harnack, and summoned he was.\r\n\r\nNowadays it is impossible to understand the opposition to him. What a\r\nman Harnack is! What an authoritative position he has won for himself\r\nin the world of the mind! What benefit, what knowledge, intercourse\r\nwith this fiery intellect has brought to me! What wonders he has\r\nachieved, as head of the Royal Library and dean of the senate of\r\nthe Kaiser Wilhelm Society, where he, the theologian, delivered the\r\nmost learned and most substantial talks on exact sciences, research,\r\ninventions, and chemistry. I shall always look back with pleasure on\r\nthe personality of Harnack and on his labors.\r\n\r\nProfessor Erich Schmidt of the University of Berlin was also a friend\r\nof mine and was often at my home; I owe many an enjoyable evening to\r\nthe learned discourses of this savant.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schiemann enjoyed my particular confidence. An upright man,\r\na native of the Baltic Provinces, a champion of the Germanic idea\r\nagainst Slavic arrogance, a clear-sighted politician and brilliant\r\nhistorian and writer, Schiemann was constantly asked by me for advice\r\non political and historical questions. To him I owe much good counsel,\r\nespecially regarding the East. He was often at my home and often\r\naccompanied me on journeys--as, for instance, to Tangier--and he\r\nheard from me in our talks much important confidential matter not yet\r\nknown to others on political questions. His unshakable capacity for\r\nkeeping his mouth shut justified my trust in him. It was a source of\r\nsatisfaction to me to appoint this tried man curator of the University\r\nof Dorpat, after the liberation of the Baltic Provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAISER'S RUSSIAN FORESIGHT\r\n\r\nHow well he and I agreed in our political views regarding Russia is\r\nillustrated by the following incident: After the Peace of Portsmouth,\r\nbetween Russia and Japan, brought about by me in conjunction with\r\nPresident Roosevelt in 1905, there was much official (Foreign Office)\r\nand unofficial puzzling of heads at Berlin as to what political line\r\nRussia would take. In general it was thought that Russia, angered at\r\nher defeat, would lean toward the West--and hence toward Germany--in\r\norder to find there new connections and strength to help her in\r\nstriking a blow for revenge against Japan and reconquest of her lost\r\nterritory and prestige.\r\n\r\nMy opinion was quite different--but I could not make the official world\r\nshare it. I emphasized the following points: That the Russians were\r\nAsiatics and Slavs; being the first, they would be inclined to favor\r\nJapan, in spite of their defeat; being the second, they would like to\r\nally themselves with those who had proved themselves strong. Hence I\r\nthought that, after a while, Russia, despite the Björkö Agreement,\r\nwould join Japan, not Germany, and turn later against Germany.\r\nOn account of these \"fantastic\" ideas, I was actually ridiculed,\r\nofficially and unofficially.\r\n\r\nI summoned Schiemann and questioned him on this subject, without\r\nrevealing to him what I thought about it. I was much pleased when his\r\nanswer agreed absolutely with the views held by me. For a long time\r\nSchiemann and I stood almost alone when this weighty matter of foreign\r\npolitics came up in discussions.\r\n\r\nThe event justified us. The so-called \"Russian experts\" of Berlin, as\r\nwell as the official world, were mistaken.\r\n\r\nDuring the very first years of my reign there was occasion for much\r\nimportant building work.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was the question of erecting a worthy monument over the\r\ntomb of my grandparents. Since the old mausoleum at Charlottenburg\r\nwas inadequate, it was necessary to erect an addition. Unfortunately,\r\nthe funds left by Emperor William the Great for such \"extra\r\nconstruction\"--the so-called Extra Construction Fund--had been used\r\nup during the ninety-nine days on something else. Hence I was obliged\r\nto burden the Crown revenues with unforeseen building expenses. The\r\nmausoleum of my parents at Marly was erected by the Empress Frederick,\r\naccording to her own sketches and designs, and for this, too, I had to\r\nprovide the funds.\r\n\r\nA thorough examination of the royal palaces--including those in the\r\nprovinces--had revealed, particularly at the palace in Berlin, such\r\ndeplorable conditions in sanitation, comfort, and so on, that there\r\ncould be no more delay in remedying them. In the course of my thirty\r\nyears' reign I restored these palaces to good condition--working in\r\naccordance with carefully prepared budgets, examined, corrected, and\r\nsupervised by myself with the help of architects (such as Ihne), and\r\nof artists, with due regard for the traditions of my ancestors--all of\r\nwhich gave me much trouble and tried my patience, but also provided me\r\nwith a great deal of enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURAL INTERESTS\r\n\r\nIn restoring the Berlin palace, the Empress Frederick, with her sure,\r\nkeen eye for the proper style and her sound judgment, helped materially\r\nin offsetting the harm and neglect dating from bygone days. My mother's\r\nexpression of her view ought surely to be of general interest: \"Any\r\nstyle is good so long as it is pure.\" Ihne used to call the eclecticism\r\nof the 'nineties \"à peu près style\" (the \"almost style\"). The\r\nrestoration of the Picture Gallery, the last work of Herr Ihne--who\r\ndied, unfortunately, all too soon--was not completed until during the\r\nfirst half of the war. The palace of my forefathers, erected at much\r\npains and a source of pride to me, was later bombarded, stormed,\r\nsacked, and devastated by revolutionary hordes.\r\n\r\nThese artistic building enterprises, as well as the already-mentioned\r\nrestoration of the White Drawing Room, belong among the duties of\r\nrepresentation devolving upon every Government, be it absolute,\r\nconstitutional, or democratic in form. They afford a criterion of the\r\nnational culture and are a means of encouraging artists and, through\r\nthem, the development of art.\r\n\r\nDuring my vacations I busied myself with archæology and was active in\r\nexcavation work. Here I kept in view one basic idea: to discover the\r\nroots from which ancient Greek art developed and to erect or find a\r\nbridge in the endeavor to establish the cultural influence of the East\r\non the West. It appeared to me that Assyriology was important, since\r\nfrom it might be expected an elucidation and vitalizing of the Old\r\nTestament, and, hence, of the Holy Scriptures. Therefore, I accepted\r\nwith pleasure the offer of the presidency of the German Orient Society\r\nand devoted myself to the study of its work, which I promoted to the\r\nbest of my ability, never missing one of its public lectures on the\r\nresults of its explorations. I had much to do with those at the head of\r\nit, and caused detailed reports to be made to me of the excavations at\r\nNineveh, Assur, and Babylon, in Egypt and in Syria, for the protection\r\nand facilitation of which I often personally brought influence to bear\r\non the Turkish Government.\r\n\r\nProfessor Delitzsch, a member of the society gave his well-known and\r\nmuch-attacked lecture on \"Babel and Bible,\" which, unfortunately, fell\r\nupon the ears of a public as yet too ignorant and unprepared, and led\r\nto all sorts of misinterpretations, some of them in church circles.\r\n\r\nI strove hard to clear up the matter. Since I realized that the\r\nimportance of Assyriology, then enlisting the efforts of many prominent\r\nmen, including clergymen of both religions, was not yet understood\r\nand appreciated by the general public, I had my trusted friend and\r\nbrilliant theater director, Count Hülsen-Haeseler, produce the play\r\n\"Assurbanipal,\" after long preparation, under the auspices of the\r\nGerman Orient Society. Assyriologists of all countries were invited\r\nto the dress rehearsal; in the boxes, all mixed up together, were\r\nprofessors, Protestant and Catholic clergymen, Jews and Christians.\r\nMany expressed to me their thanks for having shown, by this\r\nperformance, how far research work had already progressed and for\r\nhaving, at the same time, revealed more clearly to the general public\r\nthe importance of Assyriology.\r\n\r\nMy sojourn at Corfu likewise afforded me the pleasure of serving\r\narchæology and of busying myself personally with excavation. The\r\naccidental discovery of a relief head of a Gorgon near the town of\r\nCorfu led me to take charge of the work myself. I called to my aid the\r\nexperienced excavator and expert in Greek antiques, Professor Dörpfeld,\r\nwho took over the direction of the excavation work. This savant, who\r\nwas as enthusiastic as I for the ancient Hellenic world, became in the\r\ncourse of time a faithful friend of mine and an invaluable source of\r\ninstruction in questions relating to architecture, styles, and so on\r\namong the ancient Greeks and Achæans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ILIAD\" AS A GUIDE BOOK\r\n\r\nIt was a joy to hear Dörpfeld read and elucidate the old Homeric\r\npoems, and establish, by means of a map and following the hints and\r\ndescriptions of the poet, the location of the old Achæan settlements\r\ndestroyed later by the Doric migration. It appeared that the names\r\nof the old places had often been transferred by the dispossessed\r\ninhabitants to the new places. This made the identification of the\r\nlocation more difficult. Nevertheless, Dörpfeld had rediscovered the\r\nlocation of a whole series of them, with the help of his Homer, which\r\nhe carried in his hand like a Baedeker, hitting upon it by following\r\nthe minute geographical descriptions given by Homer.\r\n\r\nThis interested me so much that I took a trip by water, with the\r\nEmpress, in the company of Dörpfeld, in order to put the matter to the\r\ntest. We went to Leukas (Ithaca) and visited, one after another, the\r\nplaces made famous by the \"Odyssey,\" while Dörpfeld read from his Homer\r\nthe descriptive text referring to each. I was amazed and had to admit\r\nthat the region and the description tallied exactly.\r\n\r\nThe excavations begun by me in Corfu under Dörpfeld's direction\r\nhad valuable archæological results, since they produced evidence\r\nof an extremely remote epoch of the earliest Doric art. The relief\r\nof the Gorgon has given rise already to many theories--probable\r\nand improbable--combined, unfortunately, with a lot of superfluous\r\nacrimonious discussion. From all this, it seems to me, one of the piers\r\nfor the bridge sought by me between Asia and Europe is assuming shape.\r\n\r\nI sent reports regularly to the Archæological Society, and I also\r\nbrought the well-known Professor Caro from Athens to work with me. I\r\nwas busy with preparations for lectures to be delivered before the\r\nsociety during the winter of 1914-15, and with searching discussions\r\non many disputed questions, which I hoped to bring toward a solution\r\n\"sine ira et studio.\" It was a pleasure to me to be visited almost\r\nregularly, at Corfu, by English and American archæologists, former\r\npupils of Dörpfeld, who helped zealously in throwing light on the\r\ndifficult problems which often came up. Since they were at work in Asia\r\nMinor, I was deeply interested in hearing what importance they attached\r\nto the Asiatic influence on early Greek art--as a result of their\r\ndiscoveries--and how readily they recognized a connection with the\r\nEast in the finds made at Corfu. In 1914, Professor Duhn of Heidelberg\r\nvisited the excavations at Corfu and, after thorough investigation,\r\ngave his support to the views held by Dörpfeld and me. I shall tell in\r\na separate piece of writing about the result of my Corfu excavations.\r\n\r\nThat was the sort of thing which, in the spring of 1914, occupied the\r\nthoughts of the German Emperor, who, lusting for robbery and conquest,\r\nis accused of having bloodthirstily brought on the World War. While I\r\nwas exploring and discussing Gorgons, Doric columns, and Homer, they\r\nwere already mobilizing against us in the Caucasus and Russia. And the\r\nTsar, at the beginning of the year, when asked about his travel plans,\r\nhad replied: \"Je resterai chez moi cette année, car nous aurons la\r\nguerre!\" (\"I shall stay at home this year, for we are going to have\r\nwar!\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMy Relations with the Church\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch has been written and said about my relations with the Church.\r\nEven when I was still a prince and a student at Bonn, I realized\r\nthe harmful influence of the \"Kulturkampf\" in its last phase. The\r\nreligious rift did so much toward antagonism that once, for example, I\r\nwas directly boycotted, while on a hunting expedition, by members of\r\nleading noble Rhenish-Westphalian families of the Rhineland belonging\r\nto the Ultra-Montane party. Even as far back as that I resolved, in\r\nthe interests of the national welfare, to work toward creating a modus\r\nvivendi such as would make it possible for people professing the two\r\ncreeds to live peacefully with each other. The \"Kulturkampf,\" as such,\r\nhad come to an end before the beginning of my reign.\r\n\r\nI strove patiently and earnestly to be on good terms with the Bishops,\r\nand I was on very friendly terms with several, especially Cardinal\r\nKopp, Archbishop Simar, Doctor Schulte, Prince-Bishop Bertram, Bishop\r\nThiel, and, last but not least, Archbishop Faulhaber and Cardinal von\r\nHartmann. All of these were men far above the average and an ornament\r\nto the episcopate, who gave proof during the war of their patriotic\r\ndevotion to Emperor and Empire. This shows that I had succeeded in\r\nclearing away the mists of the \"Kulturkampf\" and enabling my Catholic\r\nsubjects, like others, to rejoice in the Empire, in accordance with the\r\nmotto, \"suum cuique\" (\"to each his own\").\r\n\r\nI was bound particularly closely all my life to Cardinal Kopp,\r\nPrince-Bishop of Breslau. He always served me loyally, so that my\r\nrelationship to him was most trusting. Of much value to me was his\r\nmediation in dealings with the Vatican, where he stood in high honor,\r\nalthough he championed absolutely the German point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDSHIP FOR POPE LEO XIII\r\n\r\nProbably little is known by the general public of the friendly,\r\ntrusting relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.\r\nA prelate who was close to him told me later that I had won the\r\nconfidence of the Pope on my first visit by the absolute frankness\r\nwhich I showed toward him and with which I told him things which others\r\nintentionally kept from his ears.\r\n\r\nReceptions by the Pope were conducted with tremendous pomp. Swiss\r\nand Noble Guards, in brilliant uniforms, servants, chamberlains, and\r\necclesiastical dignitaries, were present in large numbers--a miniature\r\nrepresentation of the might of the Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nAfter I had traversed the courts, halls, and drawing-rooms, in which\r\nall these men had arrayed themselves, I seated myself opposite the\r\nPope himself, in his little, one-windowed study. The distinguished\r\ngentleman, with the fine, noble-featured old face, whose eyes gazed\r\npiercingly at his visitor, made a deep impression upon me. We discussed\r\nmany timely subjects. I was greatly pleased that the Pope spoke\r\nappreciatively and gratefully of the position occupied in Germany by\r\nthe Catholic religion and its adherents, adding the assurance that he,\r\nfor his part, would contribute toward having the German Catholics yield\r\nto no other Germans in love for their fatherland and in loyalty.\r\n\r\nPope Leo XIII gave evidences of friendliness toward me whenever he\r\ncould. For instance, on the occasion of one of my visits to Rome,\r\nhe accorded my suite and servants the honor of a special audience;\r\nhe sent Prince-Bishop Kopp as Papal Delegate on the occasion of the\r\nconsecration by me of the portal which I had had added to the cathedral\r\nat Metz, and was so kind as to inform me of the naming of Archbishop\r\nFischer of Cologne as Cardinal, which was done to celebrate that day.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Papal Jubilee in 1903 to celebrate the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of his accession to the Papacy, I sent a\r\nspecial mission to convey my congratulations to the Pope, at the head\r\nof which was Freiherr von Loë, for many years intimately acquainted\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nNot long after that--and only a few months before his death--I paid\r\nmy third and last visit to the Pope. Though he was very weak, this\r\nninety-three-year-old man came up to me, holding both his hands\r\noutstretched. Concerning this visit, which was characterized by great\r\ncordiality on both sides, I immediately jotted down some notes, which\r\nrecently came into my possession again.\r\n\r\nThe Pope said, among other things, that he could not but give his\r\nfull approval to the principles according to which I governed; that\r\nhe had followed with interest my methods of governing and recognized\r\nwith pleasure that I had built up my rule on a foundation of firm\r\nChristianity; that such lofty religious principles underlay it that it\r\nbehooved him to ask the blessing of Heaven upon myself, my dynasty, and\r\nthe German Empire, and to grant me his apostolic benediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SWORD OF CATHOLIC CHURCH\"\r\n\r\nIt was of interest to me that the Pope said to me on this occasion that\r\nGermany must become the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that\r\nthe old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed and that\r\nconditions had changed. But he stuck to his words.\r\n\r\nThen the Pope went on to say that he must thank me once more for my\r\nunflagging attention to the welfare of my Catholic subjects; that he\r\nhad heard about this from so many sources that he was glad to tell me\r\npersonally how grateful both he and the German Catholics were for this\r\nattention to their interests; that he could assure me that my Catholic\r\nsubjects would stand by me, in good and bad times, with absolute\r\nfidelity. \"Ils resteront absolument et infailliblement fidèles\" (\"They\r\nwill remain absolutely and infallibly faithful\").\r\n\r\nI rejoiced greatly at these words of appreciation from such an exalted\r\nsource. I answered that I considered it the duty of a Christian\r\nsovereign to care for his subjects to the best of his ability,\r\nirrespective of creed; that I could assure him that, during my reign,\r\neverybody could profess his religion without interference and fulfill\r\nhis duties toward his ecclesiastical overlord; that this was a\r\nfundamental principle of my life, from which I could not be swerved.\r\n\r\nBecause I showed my Catholic fellow countrymen from the very beginning\r\nthat I wished to allow them complete freedom in the exercise of their\r\nreligion, a quieter spirit was engendered in the land and the aftermath\r\nof the \"Kulturkampf\" disappeared more and more. But I did not conceal\r\nfrom myself the fact that, despite all politeness and friendliness, the\r\nprelates, with the sole exception of Cardinal Kopp, still continued to\r\nlook upon me as the Emperor, and I was compelled to take into account\r\nthat, in the Catholic south and west, this idea would never quite\r\nvanish. Grateful acknowledgment has repeatedly been made to me of the\r\nfact that the Catholics were as well off, during my reign, as they\r\ncould possibly desire; but the constantly more uncompromising attitude\r\nof the Church on mixed marriages, and that of the Centrist party in\r\npolitics, were certainly a sign that the antiheretical tendency still\r\nlived beneath the peaceful surface.\r\n\r\nThis made all the more intense my desire for the firm union of the\r\n_Protestant Churches_--first, in Prussia, then in Germany, finally, in\r\nall Europe. My endeavors, in conjunction with the Chief Ecclesiastical\r\nCouncilor, the General Superintendent, and so on, to find means\r\nof effecting this union, were most earnest. I hailed the Eisenach\r\nConference with joy and followed its proceedings with interest. I\r\nassembled all the General Superintendents for the consecration of the\r\nChurch at Jerusalem and also was able to greet invited deputations\r\nfrom Sweden, Norway, and so forth; and I did likewise on the occasion\r\nof the consecration of the Berlin cathedral, where, among many other\r\ndeputations, the Church of England was represented by the Bishop of\r\nRipon (W. Boyd-Carpenter), the pastor of Queen Victoria of England,\r\nequally prominent as a writer and preacher.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, I worked toward compromise, closer relations and\r\nunion, yet nothing definite resulted. Though church union in Prussia\r\nhas been a success, Lutherans and Reformists kept apart in other\r\nsections of the fatherland. Many local rulers kept sharp watch over\r\ntheir rights in relation to religions and, owing to this, were hostile\r\nto a closer union of the different creeds within their territory.\r\nTherefore, despite my endeavors, the German Protestant Church was not\r\nable to unite and make common cause against the elements hostile to\r\nit. Only through the emergency brought on by the revolution was this\r\nmade possible. On Ascension Day, 1922, to my great joy, the \"German\r\nEvangelical Church Union\" was solemnly formed at the Schloss Church at\r\nWittenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR DRYANDER'S INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of my military service at Potsdam I had felt\r\ndeeply the inadequacy of the sermons, which often dealt only with\r\ndry dogmatic matter and paid too little attention to the person of\r\nChrist. In Bonn I became acquainted with Doctor Dryander, who made an\r\nimpression on me lasting throughout my life. His sermons were free from\r\ndogma, the person of Christ was their pivotal point, and \"practical\r\nChristianity\" was brought into the foreground.\r\n\r\nLater I brought him to Berlin and soon had him appointed to a post at\r\nthe Cathedral and in my palace. Dryander was by my side for years,\r\nuntil long after the 9th of November, standing close to me spiritually,\r\nand bringing to me spiritual consolation. We often talked on religious\r\nmatters and thrashed out thoroughly the tasks and the future of the\r\nProtestant Church. The views of Dryander--mild, yet powerful, clear,\r\nand of truly evangelical strength--made of him a pillar and an ornament\r\nof his Church, and a faithful co-worker with the Emperor, to whom he\r\nwas closely bound, in the interests of the Church and its development.\r\n\r\nSince the 9th of November, Doctor Dryander also has been exposed to\r\npersecutions, but he has stood his ground courageously; the hopes,\r\nbeliefs, and trust of his King are with him and the Evangelical Church!\r\nThe Church must again raise up the broken nation inwardly according to\r\nthe gospel of \"Ein'feste Burg ist unser Gott.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot allow to pass without remark the influence exerted by the\r\nwork--translated at my instigation--of the English missionary Bernard\r\nLucas, entitled _Conversations with Christ_; as well as the sermons\r\non Jesus by Pastor Schneller (Jerusalem), and the collections of\r\nsermons called _The Old God Still Lives_ and _From Deep Trouble_, by\r\nConsistorial Councilor Conrad. These brought us much inspiration and\r\ncomfort by their vital ability to absorb and hold readers and hearers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I could deal with religious and church questions with\r\ncomplete objectivity \"sine ira et studio\" is due to my excellent\r\nteacher, Professor Doctor Hinzpeter, a Westphalian Calvinist. He caused\r\nhis pupil to grow up and live with the Bible, eliminating, at the same\r\ntime, all dogmatic and polemical questions; owing to this, polemics\r\nin religion have remained alien to me, and expressions like that\r\nautocratic one, \"orthodox,\" are repulsive to me. As to my own religious\r\nconvictions, I set forth what they were years ago, in a letter to my\r\nfriend, Admiral Hollmann, made public at the time, part of which is\r\nreproduced at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nI was enabled to bring joy to the hearts of my Catholic subjects when\r\nI presented the plot of ground known as the \"Dormition,\" acquired by\r\nme from the Sultan in 1898 as a result of my sojourn in Jerusalem, to\r\nthe German Catholics there. The worthy, faithful Father Peter Schmitz,\r\nrepresentative of the Catholic Society in Jerusalem, expressed to me\r\nthe heartfelt thanks of the German Catholics on the spot in eloquent\r\nwords at the ceremony of taking possession.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH IN JERUSALEM\r\n\r\nWhen I conferred with him as to future building operations and as\r\nto the selection of persons to occupy the place, the old expert on\r\nJerusalem advised me to select none of the order of monks there, since\r\nall were more or less mixed up in the intrigues and quarrels concerning\r\nthe \"loci sacri\" (sacred spots). After my return a delegation of the\r\nGerman Knights of Malta, under Count Praschma, appeared before me to\r\nexpress their gratitude. The design for the church, made by a very\r\ntalented Cologne architect and skillfully adapted to the local style,\r\nwas submitted to me. After the completion of the church I decided that\r\nthe Benedictine monks of Beuron should take over the \"Dormition\"; they\r\ndid so in 1906, also taking over the monastery built next the new St.\r\nMary's Church.\r\n\r\nI was on friendly terms for many years with the Benedictine monks of\r\nthe Beuron Congregation, with whose Archabbot, Wolter, I had become\r\nacquainted at Sigmaringen. In mediæval times the order always stood\r\nwell with the German Emperors, of whom scarcely one failed to visit,\r\nin connection with his journeys to Rome, the magnificently situated\r\nMonte Cassino. When the Benedictine monks asked permission to establish\r\na settlement on the Rhine I had the splendid Romanesque abbey of Maria\r\nLaach--unused at the time--turned over to them. The order, which counts\r\namong its members excellent artists, including Father Desiderius, has\r\nbrought new glory to the abbey, which had fallen into neglect and\r\ndecay, by magnificent interior decorations. Often have I visited Maria\r\nLaach and rejoiced in the progress of its restoration, as well as in\r\nconversations with the intelligent abbots and in the hearty, simple\r\nreception on the part of the faithful brethren.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited the monastery of Monte Cassino I became acquainted, in\r\nthe person of Archabbot Monsignor Krug, with a man of extraordinary\r\nmental gifts and comprehensive culture, who had traveled a great\r\ndeal about the world. He could express himself with equal fluency\r\nin Italian, English, and French, and his mother tongue, German. In\r\nhis address to King Victor Emmanuel of Italy and me, he pointed out\r\nthat nearly all the German Emperors, as well as the Lombard Kings\r\nbefore them, had paid visits to Monte Cassino. He presented me with\r\na magnificent collection of copies of documents of the time of the\r\nEmperor Frederick II, taken from the library of the order, and I\r\nreciprocated by presenting him with the works of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nAgriculture flourishes in the environs of the monasteries maintained by\r\nthe Benedictine Order, being carried on by the lay brothers with all\r\nthe latest improvements, to the benefit of the backward peasantry of\r\nthe region; and in the country and town communities of the order church\r\nsinging and organ playing are zealously cultivated by the monks, who\r\nhave attained a high degree of artistic skill. The art of the goldsmith\r\nalso flourishes among the monks, likewise art embroidery among the\r\nBenedictine nuns.\r\n\r\nI caused to be reproduced in its full size the Labarum (standard) of\r\nthe Emperor Constantine the Great, designed in accordance with the\r\nresearches made by Monsignor Wilpert: one copy I presented to the Pope,\r\nanother to my Palace Chapel at Berlin. The latter was stolen from the\r\nchapel by the mob during the days of the revolution. The metal work\r\nwas done entirely by monks, the embroidery by nuns of the order, both\r\nexcellently. One of the places inhabited by nuns of this order is the\r\nconvent of Saint Hildegard, above Rüdesheim, which I visited in 1917.\r\n\r\nMy letter to Admiral Hollmann was due to the excitement aroused by a\r\nlecture entitled \"Babel and Bible,\" delivered by Professor Delitzsch\r\nbefore the German Orient Society, of which Admiral Hollmann was one of\r\nthe Board of Managers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOLARSHIP AND RELIGION\r\n\r\nThe first part of the letter, which deals primarily with Professor\r\nDelitzsch's statements, has been omitted from the reproduction of the\r\nletter printed below:\r\n\r\n                                                      _Feb. 15, 1903._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR HOLLMANN:\r\n\r\n    I should now like to return once again to my own standpoint\r\n    regarding the doctrine or view of revelation, as I have often\r\n    set it forth to you, my dear Hollmann, and other gentlemen.\r\n    I distinguish between two different kinds of revelation: a\r\n    progressive, to a certain extent historical revelation, and a\r\n    purely religious one, paving the way to the future coming of the\r\n    Messiah.\r\n\r\n    Of the first, this is to be said: There is not the smallest doubt\r\n    in my mind that God constantly reveals Himself through the human\r\n    race created by Him. He has \"breathed His breath into mankind,\" or,\r\n    in other words, given it a piece of Himself, a soul. He follows the\r\n    development of the human race with a Father's love and interest;\r\n    for the purpose of leading it forward and benefiting it, he\r\n    \"reveals\" Himself in some great savant or priest or king, whether\r\n    among the heathens, Jews, or Christians.\r\n\r\n    Hammurabi was one of these, likewise Moses, Abraham, Homer,\r\n    Charlemagne, Luther, Shakespeare, Goethe, Kant, Emperor William\r\n    the Great. These men were selected by Him and made worthy of His\r\n    grace; of achieving for their people, both in the spiritual and the\r\n    physical domain, splendid and imperishable things, in accordance\r\n    with His will. How often did my grandfather clearly emphasize that\r\n    he was but an instrument in the hand of the Lord.\r\n\r\n    The works of great minds are gifts of God to the peoples of the\r\n    earth, in order that they may improve themselves on these models\r\n    and grope forward, by means of them, through the confusion of that\r\n    which is still unexplored here below. God has certainly revealed\r\n    Himself in different ways to different peoples, according to their\r\n    standing and degree of culture, and He is still doing it now.\r\n    For, just as we are overcome most by the greatness and majesty of\r\n    the splendor of Creation when we contemplate it, and are amazed\r\n    at the greatness of God as revealed therein, so also may we, in\r\n    contemplating whatever is great or splendid in the works of a man\r\n    or a people, recognize therein with gratitude the splendor of the\r\n    revelation of God. He works directly upon us and among us! The\r\n    second kind of revelation, the more religious kind, is that which\r\n    leads to the coming of the Lord. It is introduced from Abraham\r\n    onward, slowly but with foresight, all-wise and all-knowing; for\r\n    without it mankind would have been doomed.\r\n\r\n    And now begins the most astounding influence, the revelation of\r\n    God. The tribe of Abraham, and the people descended from it,\r\n    consider the holiest thing of all, unescapable in its logical\r\n    consequences, the belief in one God. This belief they must have and\r\n    cultivate. Scattered by the captivity in Egypt, the separate parts\r\n    are welded together by Moses for the second time, and still they\r\n    try to maintain their \"monotheism.\" The direct intervention of God\r\n    is what brings regeneration to this people.\r\n\r\nKAISER'S THEOLOGY\r\n\r\n    And thus it goes through the centuries, until the Messiah announced\r\n    and foreshadowed by the Prophets and Psalmists shall at last\r\n    appear. The greatest revelation of God in the world! For He Himself\r\n    appeared in the body of His Son; Christ is God, God in human\r\n    form. He saved us. He inspires us, we are led to follow Him, we\r\n    feel His fire burning within us, His pity strengthening us, His\r\n    dissatisfaction destroying us, but also His intercession saving us.\r\n    Sure of victory, building solely upon His word, we go through work,\r\n    scorn, grief, misery, and death, for in Him we have the revealed\r\n    word of God, and God never lies.\r\n\r\n    That is my view of this question. The Word, especially for us of\r\n    the Evangelical faith, has become everything on account of Luther;\r\n    and Delitzsch, as a good theologian, should not forget that our\r\n    great Luther taught us to sing and believe: \"Das Wort sie sollen\r\n    lassen stehn\" (\"The Word they must allow to stand\").\r\n\r\n    It is self-evident that the Old Testament contains a large number\r\n    of parts which are of purely human-historical character and not\r\n    \"God's revealed Word.\" These are purely historical descriptions\r\n    of events of all sorts, which occur in the life of the people of\r\n    Israel in the domain of politics, religion, morals, and spiritual\r\n    life.\r\n\r\n    For instance, the giving out of the Law on Mount Sinai can be\r\n    looked upon only symbolically as having been inspired by God,\r\n    since Moses had to turn to a revival of laws perhaps known of old\r\n    (possibly drawn from the Code of Hammurabi), in order to bring\r\n    coherence and solidarity to the framework of his people, which was\r\n    loose and little capable of resistance. Here the historian may\r\n    perhaps find a connection, either in sense or words, with the laws\r\n    of Hammurabi, the friend of Abraham, which may be logically right;\r\n    but this can never affect the fact that God had inspired Moses to\r\n    act thus, and, to that extent, had revealed Himself to the people\r\n    of Israel.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, my view is that our good professor should rather avoid\r\n    introducing and treating of religion as such in his lectures\r\n    before our association, but that he may continue, unhindered, to\r\n    describe whatever brings the religion, customs, and so on of the\r\n    Babylonians, and so on, into relation with the Old Testament.\r\n\r\n    As far as I am concerned, I am led by the above to the following\r\n    conclusion:\r\n\r\n    (a) I believe in one only God.\r\n\r\n    (b) We men need, in order to teach Him, a _Form_, especially for\r\n    our children.\r\n\r\n    (c) This _Form_ has been, up to now, the Old Testament, as we now\r\n    know it. This _Form_ will be essentially changed by research,\r\n    inscriptions, and excavations; but that will cause no harm, nor\r\n    will the fact that, thereby, much of the halo of the Chosen People\r\n    will disappear, cause any harm. The kernel and content remain\r\n    always the same: God and His influence.\r\n\r\n    Religion was never a result of science, but something flowing from\r\n    the heart and being of man, through his relations with God.\r\n\r\n    With heartiest thanks and many greetings, I remain always\r\n\r\n                         Your sincere friend,\r\n                                 (Signed) WILHELM I. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nArmy and Navy\r\n\r\n\r\nMy close relations with the army are a matter of common knowledge. In\r\nthis direction I conformed to the tradition of my family. Prussia's\r\nkings did not chase cosmopolitan mirages, but realized that the welfare\r\nof their land could only be assured by means of a real power protecting\r\nindustry and commerce. If, in a number of utterances, I admonished my\r\npeople to \"keep their powder dry\" and \"their swords sharp,\" the warning\r\nwas addressed alike to foe and friend. I wished our foes to pause and\r\nthink a long time before they dared to engage with us. I wished to\r\ncultivate a manly spirit in the German people; I wished to make sure\r\nthat, when the hour struck for us to defend the fruits of our industry\r\nagainst an enemy's lust of conquest, it should find a strong race.\r\n\r\nIn view of this I attached high value to the educational duty of the\r\narmy. General compulsory military service has a social influence upon\r\nmen in the mass equaled by nothing else. It brings together rich and\r\npoor, sons of the soil and of the city; it brings acquaintanceship and\r\nmutual understanding among young people whose roads, otherwise, would\r\nlead them far apart; the feeling that they are serving one idea unites\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd think what we made out of our young men! Pale town boys were\r\ntransformed into erect, healthy, sport-hardened men; limbs grown stiff\r\nthrough labor were made adroit and pliable.\r\n\r\nI stepped direct from brigade commander to king--to repeat the\r\nwell-known words of King Frederick William III. Up to then I had\r\nclimbed the steps of an officer's career. I still think with pleasure\r\nof my pride when, on the 2d of May, 1869, during the spring parade,\r\nI first stood in the ranks before my grandfather. Relations with the\r\nindividual man have always seemed valuable to me, and, therefore, I\r\nparticularly treasured the assignments, during my military service,\r\nwhere I could cultivate such relations. My activities as commander of a\r\ncompany, a squadron, and a battery, likewise as head of a regiment, are\r\nunforgettable to me.\r\n\r\nI felt at home among my soldiers. In them I placed unlimited trust.\r\nThe painful experiences of the autumn of 1918 have not diminished this\r\ntrust. I do not forget that a part of the German people, after four\r\nyears of unprecedented achievements and privations, had become too ill\r\nto withstand being corrupted by foes within and without. Moreover, the\r\nbest of the Germans lay under the green sod; the others were thrown\r\ninto such consternation by the events of the revolution which had been\r\nheld to be impossible that they could not spur themselves to act.\r\n\r\nCompulsory military service was the best school for the physical and\r\nmoral toughening of our people. It created for us free men who knew\r\ntheir own value. From these an excellent corps of noncommissioned\r\nofficers was formed; from the latter, in turn, we drew our Government\r\nofficials, the like of whom, in ability, incorruptibility and fidelity\r\nto duty no other nation on earth can show.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELIEVES OFFICERS STILL LOYAL\r\n\r\nAnd it is from these very elements that I receive nowadays signs of\r\nloyalty, every one of which does me good. My old Second Company of the\r\nFirst Infantry Guard Regiment has shared, through good and evil days,\r\nthe vicissitudes of its old captain. I saw them for the last time in\r\n1913, in close formation--still one hundred twenty-five strong--under\r\nthat excellent sergeant, Hartmann, on the occasion of the celebration\r\nof the twenty-fifth anniversary of my accession to the throne.\r\n\r\nIn view of its proud duty as an educator and leader of the nation in\r\narms, the officer corps occupied a particularly important position in\r\nthe German Empire. The method of replacement, which, by adoption of\r\nthe officers' vote, had been lodged in the hands of the various bodies\r\nof officers themselves, guaranteed the needed homogeneity. Harmful\r\noutcroppings of the idea of caste were merely sporadic; wherever they\r\nmade themselves felt they were instantly rooted out.\r\n\r\nI entered much and willingly into relations with the various officer\r\ncorps and felt like a comrade among them. The materialistic spirit of\r\nour age, to be sure, had not passed over the officer corps without\r\nleaving traces; but, on the whole, it must be admitted that nowhere\r\nelse were self-discipline, fidelity to duty, and simplicity cultivated\r\nto such an extent as among the officers.\r\n\r\nA process of weeding out such as existed in no other profession\r\nallowed only the ablest and best to reach positions of influence. The\r\ncommanding generals were men of a high degree of attainment and ability\r\nand--what is even more important--men of character. It is a difficult\r\nmatter to single out individuals from among them.\r\n\r\nThough the man in the ranks at the front was always particularly\r\nclose to my heart, I must, nevertheless, give special prominence to\r\nthe General Staff as a school for the officer corps. I have already\r\nremarked that Field Marshal Count Moltke had known how by careful\r\ntraining to build up men who were not only up to requirements,\r\ntechnically speaking, but also qualified for action demanding\r\nwillingness to assume responsibility, independence of judgment, and\r\nfar-sightedness. \"To be more than you seem\" is written in the preface\r\nto the _Pocket Manual for the General Staff Officer_.\r\n\r\nField Marshal Count Moltke laid the foundations for this training; and\r\nhis successors--Count Waldersee, that great genius, Count Schlieffen,\r\nand General von Moltke--built upon them. The result was the General\r\nStaff, which accomplished unprecedented feats in the World War, and\r\naroused admiration throughout the world.\r\n\r\nI soon realized that the greatest possible improvement of our highly\r\ndeveloped technical department was absolutely necessary and would save\r\nprecious blood. Wherever possible, I worked toward the perfection of\r\nour armament and sought to place machinery in the service of our army.\r\n\r\nAmong new creations, the very first place is taken by the heavy\r\nartillery of the army in the field. In bringing this into being I\r\nwas obliged to overcome much opposition--particularly, strange to\r\nrelate, in the ranks of the artillery itself. It is a source of\r\ngreat satisfaction to me that I put this matter through. It laid the\r\nfoundation for the carrying out of operations on a large scale, and it\r\nwas long before our foes could catch up with us in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETTER MILITARY EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nMention must also be made of the machine gun, which developed from\r\nmodest beginnings to being the backbone of the infantry's fighting\r\npowers; the replacement of the rifle by the machine gun multiplied the\r\nfiring power of the infantry while, at the same time, diminishing its\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nNor can I pass over without mention the introduction of the movable\r\nfield kitchen, which I had seen for the first time at some maneuvers\r\nof the Russian army. It was of the greatest value in maintaining the\r\nfighting efficiency of the army, since the possibility of getting\r\nsufficient nourishment kept our troops fresh and healthy.\r\n\r\nAll human work remains unfinished. Nevertheless, it may be said,\r\nwithout exaggeration, that the German army which marched to battle in\r\n1914 was an instrument of warfare without an equal.\r\n\r\nWhereas, at my accession to the throne, I had found the army in a\r\ncondition which merely required development upon the foundations\r\nalready laid, the navy, on the other hand, was in the first stage of\r\ndevelopment. After the failure of all the attempts of Admiral Hollmann\r\nto move the recalcitrant Reichstag to adopt a slowly progressing,\r\nsystematic strengthening of German sea power--largely due to the cheap\r\ncatchwords of Deputy Richter and the lack of understanding of the\r\nLiberals of the Left, who were fooled by them--the Admiral requested\r\nme to retire him. Deeply moved, I acceded to his request; this plain,\r\nloyal man, the son of a genuine Berlin bourgeois family, had become\r\ndear to me through his upright character, his devotion to duty, and his\r\nattachment to me. My friendship with him, based upon this estimate,\r\nlasted for many years up to the moment of the Admiral's sudden death;\r\nit often caused me to visit this faithful man, endowed with fine Berlin\r\nwit, at his home, and there to associate with him as head of the German\r\nOrient Society, as well as to see him, in a small circle of intimates,\r\nat my own home, or to take him with me as a treasured traveling\r\ncompanion. He was one of the most faithful of my faithful friends,\r\nalways remaining the same in his disinterestedness, never asking\r\nanything for himself. Happy the city which can produce such citizens! I\r\npreserve a grateful memory of this tried and trusted friend.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Tirpitz succeeded Hollmann. In his very first reports,\r\nwhich laid the foundation of the first Naval law, he showed himself\r\nthoroughly in accord with me in the belief that the sanction of the\r\nReichstag for the building of warships was not to be gained by the old\r\nform of procedure. As I have already pointed out, the opposition was\r\nnot to be convinced; the tone of the debates conducted by Richter was\r\nunworthy of the importance of the subject; for instance, the gunboat\r\nobtained in the Reichstag by the Poles, under Herr von Koscielsky, was\r\njokingly dubbed _Koscielska_. Ridicule was the weapon used, though the\r\nfuture of the fatherland was in question.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that the representative of the navy should have a\r\nsolid phalanx behind him, both among the Ministers of State and in the\r\nReichstag, and that it should, from absolute conviction, energetically\r\nsupport him and the cause. Therefore, there was need of communicating\r\nto the Reichstag members, still rather ignorant in naval matters,\r\nthe details of the great work; moreover, a great movement must be\r\nengineered among the people, among the \"general public,\" indifferent\r\nas yet, to arouse its interest and enthusiasm for the navy, in order\r\nthat pressure from the people itself might be brought to bear upon the\r\nReichstag members. To this end, an energetic propaganda was needed,\r\nthrough a well-organized and well-directed press, as well as through\r\neminent men of science at the universities and technical high schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGHT IN THE REICHSTAG\r\n\r\nThere was need of a complete change in the whole method of handling\r\nthe matter in the Reichstag. There must be no more bickerings about\r\nindividual ships and docks. In making up the military budget, no\r\narguments arose over the strength of the army, unless it was a\r\nmatter of new formations. The makeup of the navy, like that of the\r\narmy, must be settled by law once for all, its right of existence\r\nrecognized and protected. The units composing it must no longer be a\r\nmatter for debate. Moreover, not only the officer corps but that of\r\nnoncommissioned officers must be strengthened and trained, in order to\r\nbe ready for service on the new ships. At the beginning of my reign,\r\nsixty to eighty cadets, at the most, were enrolled every year; in the\r\nlast few years before the war several hundred asked admission. Twelve\r\nprecious years, never to be retrieved, were lost by the failure of the\r\nReichstag; it is even harder to create a navy overnight than an army.\r\n\r\nThe goal to be striven for was implied in the law, which expressed the\r\n\"idea of risk\"; the aim was to cause even the strongest hostile fleet\r\nto think seriously before it came to blows with the German fleet, in\r\nview of the heavy losses that were to be feared in a battle, which put\r\nthe foe in danger of becoming too weak for other tasks. The \"idea of\r\nrisk\" was brilliantly vindicated in the Skager-Rak (Jutland) battle;\r\nthe enemy, in spite of his immense superiority, dared not risk a second\r\nbattle. Trafalgar was already dim; its laurels must not be completely\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe total number of units (ships) on hand--it was principally a matter\r\nof ships of the line--was taken as a basis for the Naval law, although\r\nthese, with the exception of the four ships of the _Brandenburg_ class,\r\nwere little better than old iron.\r\n\r\nThe Naval law was looked upon by many laymen, in view of the numbers\r\ninvolved, as a naval increase. In reality, however, this was a false\r\nview, since the so-called existing fleet was absolutely no longer\r\na fleet. It was slowly dying of old age--as Hollmann said when he\r\nretired; included in it were almost the oldest ships still in service\r\nin all Europe.\r\n\r\nNow that the Naval law was gradually coming into force, lively building\r\noperations set in, launchings were reported in the press, and there\r\nwas joy among those under the dominion of the \"rage du nombre\" at the\r\ngrowing number of ships. But when it was made clear to them that as\r\nsoon as the new ships were ready the old ones must be eliminated, so\r\nthat, as a matter of fact, the total number of ships of fighting value\r\nwould, at first, not be increased, they were greatly disillusioned. Had\r\nthe necessary ships been built in time during the wasted twelve years\r\nthe Naval law would have found a quite different, usable basis already\r\nin existence. But as matters now stood it was really a question of the\r\ncomplete rebuilding of the entire German fleet.\r\n\r\nThe large number of ships, to which those which had to be eliminated\r\nwere added, was a fallacy. Therefore the English made a mistake when\r\nthey merely took account of the number of ships--since that fitted in\r\nwell with the propaganda against Germany--but paid no attention to age\r\nor type, arriving thus at a total that was far too high, and, by such\r\nmisleading methods, artificially nourishing the so-called apprehension\r\nat the growth of the German navy.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Tirpitz now went ahead with the program approved by me. With\r\niron energy and merciless sacrifice of his health and strength he\r\nsoon was able to inject efficiency and power into the handling of the\r\nnaval question. At my command he went, after the drafting of the Naval\r\nlaw, to Friedrichsruh, the residence of Prince Bismarck, in order to\r\nconvince the latter of the necessity for having a German navy.\r\n\r\nThe press worked zealously toward the introduction of the Naval law,\r\nand political economists, experts on commerce and politics and so\r\nforth, placed their pens at the service of the great national cause,\r\nthe necessity for a navy having been by now widely realized.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the English, too, helped--though quite\r\nunconsciously--toward bettering the Naval law's chance of being\r\npassed. The Boer War had broken out, and had aroused among the German\r\npeople much sympathy for the little country and much indignation on\r\naccount of England's violent assault upon it. Thereupon the news came\r\nof the utterly unjustified capture of two German steamers on the East\r\nAfrican coast by English warships. Indignation was general.\r\n\r\nThe news of the stopping of the second steamer happened to be received\r\nby the Secretary of State, von Bülow, at the very moment when Tirpitz\r\nand I were with him. As soon as Bülow had read the dispatch aloud, I\r\nquoted the old English proverb, \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody\r\ngood,\" and Tirpitz exclaimed, \"Now we have the wind we need for\r\nbringing our ship into port. The Naval law will go through. Your\r\nMajesty must present a medal to the captain of the English ship in\r\ngratitude for having put it through.\"\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Chancellor ordered up champagne and the three of us drank\r\njoyously to the new law, its acceptance, and the future German fleet,\r\nnot forgetting to express our thanks to the English navy, which had\r\nproved so helpful to us.\r\n\r\nMany years later, on my return from Lowther Castle, where I had been\r\nhunting with Lord Lonsdale, I was invited to dine with Lord Rosebery,\r\nthe great Liberal statesman and former Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nalso known through his researches in the history of Napoleon, at his\r\nbeautiful country estate of Dalmeny Castle, situated close to the sea,\r\nnot far from the great Forth bridge. Among the guests was General Sir\r\nIan Hamilton, a Scotchman, well known on account of his part in the\r\nBoer War, with whom I had become acquainted when he was a guest at the\r\nImperial German maneuvers, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and a captain\r\nof the English navy, who was commander of the naval station there.\r\n\r\nThe last sat next Admiral Freiherr von Senden, directly across the\r\ntable from me, and attracted my attention by the obvious embarrassment\r\nwhich he manifested in his talk with the Admiral, which he conducted in\r\na low voice. After dinner Admiral von Senden introduced the captain to\r\nme, whereat the Englishman's embarrassment caused him to behave even\r\nmore awkwardly than before, and aroused my attention because of the\r\nworried look of his eyes and his pale face.\r\n\r\nAfter the conversation, which turned on various maritime topics, had\r\ncome to an end, I asked Freiherr von Senden what the matter was with\r\nthe man; the Admiral laughed and replied that he had elicited from his\r\nneighbor, during the meal, that he had been the commander of the ship\r\nwhich had captured the two German steamers in the Boer War, and that\r\nhe had been afraid that I might find this out. Senden had thereupon\r\ntold him that he was entirely mistaken about this; that had His Majesty\r\nlearned who he was he could rest assured that he would have been very\r\nwell treated and thanked into the bargain.\r\n\r\n\"Thanked? What for?\" queried the Englishman.\r\n\r\n\"For having made the passage of the Naval law so much easier for the\r\nEmperor!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the prime considerations in the passage of the Naval law--as\r\nalso for all later additions, and, in general, for the whole question\r\nof warship construction--was the question whether the German\r\nshipbuilding industry would be in a position to keep pace with the\r\nnaval program; whether, in fact, it would be able to carry it out\r\nat all. Here, too, Admiral von Tirpitz worked with tireless energy.\r\nEncouraged and fired with enthusiasm by him, the German shipbuilding\r\nyards went at the great problem, filled with German audacity, and\r\nsolved it with positively brilliant results, greatly distancing their\r\nforeign competitors. The admirable technical endowment of the German\r\nengineers, as well as the better education of the German working\r\nclasses, contributed in full measure toward this achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVERISH HASTE FOR NAVY\r\n\r\nConsultations, conferences, reports to me, service trips to all\r\nshipbuilding yards, were the daily bread of the indefatigable Tirpitz.\r\nBut the tremendous trouble and work were richly rewarded. The people\r\nwoke up, began to have a thought for the value of the colonies (raw\r\nmaterials provided by ourselves without foreign middlemen!) and for\r\ncommercial relations, and to feel interest in commerce, navigation,\r\nshipping, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd, at last, the derisive opposition stopped cracking its jokes.\r\nTirpitz, always ready for battle, wielded a sharp blade in fighting,\r\nnever joked and allowed nobody to joke with him, so that his opponents\r\nno longer felt like laughing. Things went particularly badly with\r\nDeputy Richter when Tirpitz brilliantly snubbed and silenced him\r\nby quoting a patriotic saying, dating from the 'forties, of old\r\nHarkort--whose district Richter represented--concerning the need for a\r\nGerman fleet. Now it was the turn of the other side of the Reichstag to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nAnd so the great day dawned. The law was passed, after much fighting\r\nand talking, by a great majority. The strength of the German navy was\r\nassured; naval construction was to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nBy means of construction and keeping an increased number of ships in\r\nservice a fleet soon sprang into being. In order to maneuver, lead,\r\nand train its personnel a new book of regulations and signal code were\r\nneeded--at the beginning of my reign these had been worked out merely\r\nfor one division--four ships--since at that time a larger number of\r\nunits never navigated together in the German navy--_i. e._, a larger\r\nnumber were not kept in service. And even these were out of service\r\nin the autumn, so that, in winter, there was (with the exception of\r\ncruisers in foreign waters) absolutely no German navy. All the care\r\nexpended during the summer season on training of crews, officers,\r\nnoncommissioned officers, engine-room crews, and stokers, as well as\r\non rigging and upkeep of ships, was as good as wasted when the ships\r\nwere retired from service in the autumn; and when spring came and they\r\nwere put back into commission things had to be started at the beginning\r\nagain. The result was that any degree of continuity in training and\r\nof coherence among the crews with relation to each other and their\r\nships--of \"ship spirit,\" in short--could not be maintained. This\r\nwas maintained only on board the ships stationed in foreign waters.\r\nTherefore, after the necessary heating equipment, etc., had been put\r\nin, I ordered that ships be kept in service also through the winter,\r\nwhich was a veritable boon to the development of the fleet.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the necessary number of units needed by the new\r\nregulations, Admiral von Tirpitz, in view of the shortage of ships of\r\nthe line, had already formed into divisions all the sorts of vessels\r\navailable, including gunboats and dispatch boats, and carried out\r\nevolutions with them, so that when the replacement of line ships began\r\nto take place the foundations for the new regulations had already been\r\nlaid. The latter were then constantly developed with the greatest\r\nenergy by all the officials concerned and kept pace with the growth of\r\nthe fleet.\r\n\r\nHard work was done on the development of that important weapon, the\r\ntorpedo boat. At that time we were filled with joyful pride that a\r\nGerman torpedo-boat division was the first united torpedo squadron ever\r\nto cross the North Sea. It sailed, under the command of my brother,\r\nPrince Henry, to take part in the celebration of Queen Victoria's\r\nGolden Jubilee (1887).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL GOETHAL'S VISIT\r\n\r\nThe development of Heligoland and its fortifications as a point of\r\nsupport for small cruisers and torpedo boats--also, later on, for\r\nU-boats--was also taken in hand, after the necessary protective work\r\nfor preserving the island had been constructed by the state--in\r\nconnection with which work the Empire and Prussia fought like cat and\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nOn account of the growth of the fleet it became necessary to widen\r\nthe Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. After a hard struggle we caused the new\r\nlocks to be built of the largest possible size, capable of meeting\r\nthe development of dreadnaughts for a long time to come. There the\r\nfar-sighted policy of the Admiral was brilliantly vindicated.\r\n\r\nThis found unexpected corroboration by a foreigner. Colonel Goethals,\r\nthe builder of the Panama Canal, requested through the United States\r\nGovernment permission to inspect the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and its\r\nnew locks. Permission was most willingly granted. After a meal with\r\nme, at which Admiral von Tirpitz was present, the Admiral questioned\r\nthe American engineer (who was enthusiastic over our construction\r\nwork) concerning the measurements of the Panama locks, whereupon it\r\ntranspired that the measurements of the locks of the Panama Canal were\r\nmuch smaller than those of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. To my astonished\r\nquestion as to how that could be possible, Goethals replied that the\r\nNavy Department, upon inquiry by him, had given those measurements for\r\nships of the line. Admiral von Tirpitz then remarked that this size\r\nwould be far from adequate for the future, and that the newer type of\r\ndreadnaughts and superdreadnaughts would not be able to go through\r\nthe locks, consequently the canal would soon be useless for American\r\nand other big battleships. The Colonel agreed, and remarked that\r\nthis was already true of the newest ships under construction, and he\r\ncongratulated His Excellency upon having had the courage to demand and\r\nput through the big locks of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, which he had\r\nlooked upon with admiration and envy.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the very backward and antiquated Imperial docks [the\r\nold tinker's shops, as Tirpitz called them] were rebuilt and developed\r\ninto model modern plants and the arrangements for the workers were\r\ndeveloped so as to further the welfare of the latter along the most\r\napproved lines. Only those who, like myself, have followed and seen\r\nwith their own eyes from the very beginning the origin and development\r\nof all these factors necessary to the building up--nay, the creation\r\nanew--of the fleet can form anything like a proper idea of the enormous\r\nachievement of Admiral von Tirpitz and his entire corps of assistants.\r\n\r\nThe office of the Imperial Naval Department was also a new creation;\r\nthe old \"Oberkommando\" was eliminated when it was divided into the two\r\nmain branches of Admiralty Staff and Imperial Naval Department. Both of\r\nthese (as in the army) were directly under the supreme war commander\r\nin chief--this meant that there was no longer any official between the\r\nEmperor and his navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMING OF THE DREADNAUGHT\r\n\r\nWhen Admiral Fisher evolved an entirely new type of ship for England\r\nin the shape of the \"dreadnaught\"--thereby surprising the world as\r\nif he had launched a sudden assault upon it--and thought that he had\r\nthus given England, once for all, an unapproachable naval superiority\r\nwhich the rest of the powers could never meet, there was naturally\r\ngreat excitement in all naval circles. The idea, to be sure, did\r\nnot originate with Fisher, but came--in the form of an appeal to\r\nshipbuilders of the whole world--from the famous Italian engineer\r\nCuniberti, who had made public a sketch in Fred Jane's _Illustrated\r\nNaval Atlas_.\r\n\r\nAt the first conference regarding the introduction of the \"dreadnaught\"\r\ntype of big fighting ship by England I at once agreed with Admiral\r\nvon Tirpitz that it had robbed all pre-dreadnaughts of their value\r\nand consigned them to the scrap heap, especially the German ships,\r\nwhich it had been necessary to keep considerably smaller, on account\r\nof the measurements of our old locks, than the ships of other navies,\r\nparticularly the English.\r\n\r\nThereupon Admiral von Tirpitz remarked that this would also apply to\r\nthe English fleet itself as soon as the other nations had followed\r\nFisher's example; that England had robbed her enormous pre-dreadnaught\r\nforce, upon which her great superiority lasted, of its fighting value,\r\nwhich would necessitate her building an entirely new fleet of big\r\nfighting ships, in competition with the entire world, which would do\r\nlikewise; that this would be exceedingly costly; that England, in\r\norder to maintain her notorious \"two-Power standard,\" would have to\r\nexert herself to such an extent that she would look with more disfavor\r\nthan ever on new warships built by other nations, toward whom she was\r\nunfriendly, and begin to make objections; then this would be especially\r\ntrue if we started building, but would be in vain, since, with the\r\nexisting types of ships in our fleet, we could not expect to fight\r\nagainst big battleships, but were forced, \"nolens volens,\" to follow\r\nEngland along this road.\r\n\r\nThe war fully confirmed Admiral Tirpitz's opinion. Every one of our\r\nships not in the big fighting-ship class had to be retired from service.\r\n\r\nWhen the first German big fighting ship was placed in service there\r\nwas a loud outcry in the land of the British. The conviction gradually\r\ndawned that Fisher and his shipbuilders had counted absolutely on\r\nthe belief that Germany would not be able to build any big fighting\r\nships. Therefore the disappointment was all the greater. Why such an\r\nassumption was made is beyond comprehension, since, even at that time,\r\nGerman shipbuilders had already built the great ocean greyhounds, far\r\nsurpassing our warships of the line in tonnage, which had occasioned\r\npainfully noticeable competition to the English steamship lines. Our\r\nbig fighting ships, despite their small number, showed themselves,\r\nat the Skager-Rak (Jutland) battle, not only equal to their English\r\nopponents, but superior to them both in seaworthiness and in standing\r\nup under gunfire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPATIENT FOR U-BOATS\r\n\r\nThe building of U-boats, unfortunately, could not be pushed forward\r\nbefore the war to an extent commensurate with my desires. On the one\r\nhand, it was necessary not to overburden the naval budget during the\r\ncarrying out of the Naval law; moreover, most important of all, it was\r\nnecessary to collect further data from experiments.\r\n\r\nTirpitz believed that the types with which other nations were\r\nexperimenting were too small and fit only for coast defense; that\r\nGermany must build \"seagoing\" submarines capable of navigating in the\r\nopen sea; that this necessitated a larger type--which, however, must\r\nfirst be systematically developed. This took a long time and required\r\ncareful experiments with models.\r\n\r\nThe result was that, at first, in 1914, there were only a small number\r\nof seaworthy submarines in readiness. Even then more pressure might\r\nhave been brought to bear upon England with the available submarines\r\nhad not the Chancellor been so concerned lest England be provoked\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nThe number and efficiency of the submarines rose rapidly in the course\r\nof the war; in considering numbers, however, one must always remember\r\nthat in wartime, U-boats are to be reckoned as follows: One third\r\nof the total in active service, one third on the outward or return\r\njourney, one third undergoing repairs. The achievements of the U-boats\r\naroused the admiration of the entire world and won the ardent gratitude\r\nof the fatherland.\r\n\r\nAdmiral von Tirpitz's tremendous success in creating the commercial\r\ncolony of Tsing-tao must never be forgotten. Here he gave proof once\r\nmore of his brilliant talent for administration and organization in\r\nall directions. Those talents of his created, out of a place that was\r\npreviously almost unknown and entirely without importance, a commercial\r\ncenter which, within a few years, showed a turnover of between fifty\r\nand sixty millions.\r\n\r\nThe dealings with Reichstag members, the press, and big industrial and\r\nworld-commercial elements gradually increased the Admiral's interest in\r\npolitical matters, particularly in foreign affairs, which were always\r\nbound up with the utilization of ships. The clear world-vision acquired\r\nby him as a traveled sailor, well acquainted with foreign parts,\r\nqualified Tirpitz to make quick decisions, which his fiery temperament\r\nwished to see translated promptly into action.\r\n\r\nThe opposition and slowness of officialdom irritated him greatly.\r\nA certain tendency to distrust, perhaps strengthened by many an\r\nexperience, often misled him to harbor suspicion--sometimes justified,\r\nsometimes not--against individuals. This caused a strong tinge of\r\nreserve in Tirpitz's character and \"hampered the joyful workings of the\r\nheart\" in others. He was also capable of bringing to bear new views on\r\na matter with great decision, when, after renewed reflection or study\r\nof new facts, he had altered his previous view. This made working with\r\nhim not always exactly agreeable or easy. The tremendous results of his\r\nachievements, of which he was justly proud, gave him a consciousness of\r\nthe power of his personality, which sometimes made itself apparent even\r\nto his friends.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Tirpitz's tendency to mix in politics got the upper\r\nhand with him so much that it eventually led to differences of\r\nopinion which finally caused his retirement, since von Bethmann, the\r\nImperial Chancellor, demanded the dismissal of the Admiral-in-chief\r\nwith the observation that the Imperial Secretaries of State were his\r\nsubordinates and that the political policy must be conducted by himself\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIt was with a heavy heart that I acquiesced in the departure of this\r\nenergetic, strong-willed man, who had carried out my plans with genius\r\nand who was indefatigable as a co-worker. Tirpitz may always rest\r\nassured of my Imperial gratitude. If only this source of strength might\r\nstand soon again by the side of the unfortunate German fatherland in\r\nits misery and distress! Tirpitz can do and dares to do what many\r\nothers do not dare. The saying of the poet most certainly applies to\r\nAdmiral von Tirpitz: \"The greatest blessing to the children of earth\r\nis, after all, personality!\"\r\n\r\nThe criticisms which the Admiral felt constrained to make of me, in his\r\nbook--which is well worth reading--cannot change, in the slightest, my\r\nopinion of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe Outbreak of War\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of the news of the assassination of my friend, the\r\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand, I gave up going to Kiel for the regatta week\r\nand went back home, since I intended to go to Vienna for his funeral.\r\nBut I was asked from there to give up this plan. Later I heard that one\r\nof the reasons for this was consideration for my personal safety; to\r\nthis I naturally would have paid no attention.\r\n\r\nGreatly worried on account of the turn which matters might now take, I\r\ndecided to give up my intended journey to Norway and remain at home.\r\nThe Imperial Chancellor and the Foreign Office held a view contrary to\r\nmine and wished me to undertake the journey, as they considered that it\r\nwould have a quieting effect on all Europe. For a long time I argued\r\nagainst going away from my country at a time when the future was so\r\nunsettled, but Imperial Chancellor von Bethmann told me, in short and\r\nconcise terms, that if I were now to give up my travel plans, which\r\nwere already widely known, this would make the situation appear more\r\nserious than it had been up to that moment and possibly lead to the\r\noutbreak of war, for which I might be held responsible; that the whole\r\nworld was merely waiting to be put out of suspense by the news that I,\r\nin spite of the situation, had quietly gone on my trip.\r\n\r\nThereupon I consulted the Chief of the General Staff, and, when he\r\nalso proved to be calm and unworried regarding the state of affairs\r\nand himself asked for a summer leave of absence to go to Carlsbad, I\r\ndecided, though with a heavy heart, upon my departure.\r\n\r\nThe much-discussed so-called Potsdam Crown Council of July 5th in\r\nreality never took place. It is an invention of malevolent persons.\r\nNaturally, before my departure, I received, as was my custom, some\r\nof the Ministers individually, in order to hear from them reports\r\nconcerning their departments. Neither was there any council of\r\nMinisters and there was no talk about war preparations at a single one\r\nof the conferences.\r\n\r\nMy fleet was cruising in the Norwegian fjords, as usual, while I was\r\non my summer vacation trip. During my stay at Balholm I received only\r\nmeager news from the Foreign Office and was obliged to rely principally\r\non the Norwegian newspapers, from which I got the impression that the\r\nsituation was growing worse. I telegraphed repeatedly to the Chancellor\r\nand the Foreign Office that I considered it advisable to return home,\r\nbut was asked each time not to interrupt my journey.\r\n\r\nWhen I learned that the English fleet had not dispersed after the\r\nreview at Spithead, but had remained concentrated, I telegraphed again\r\nto Berlin that I considered my return necessary. My opinion was not\r\nshared there.\r\n\r\nBut when, after that, I learned from the Norwegian newspapers--not\r\nfrom Berlin--about the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia, and, immediately\r\nthereafter, about the Serbian note to Austria, I started without\r\nfurther ado upon my return journey and commanded the fleet to repair\r\nto Wilhelmshaven. Upon my departure I learned from a Norwegian source\r\nthat it was said that a part of the English fleet had left secretly\r\nfor Norway in order to capture me (though peace still reigned!). It\r\nis significant that Sir Edward Goschen, the English ambassador, was\r\ninformed on July 26th at the Foreign Office that my return journey,\r\nundertaken on my own initiative, was to be regretted, since agitating\r\nrumors might be caused by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAYS WAR WAS NOT FORESEEN\r\n\r\nUpon my arrival at Potsdam I found the Chancellor and the Foreign\r\nOffice in conflict with the Chief of the General Staff, since General\r\nvon Moltke was of the opinion that war was sure to break out, whereas\r\nthe other two stuck firmly to their view that things would not get to\r\nsuch a bad pass, that there would be some way of avoiding war, provided\r\nI did not order mobilization. This dispute kept up steadily. Not until\r\nGeneral von Moltke announced that the Russians had set fire to their\r\nfrontier posts, torn up the frontier railway tracks, and posted red\r\nmobilization notices did a light break upon the diplomats in the\r\nWilhelmstrasse and bring about both their own collapse and that of\r\ntheir powers of resistance. They had not _wished_ to _believe_ in the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThis shows plainly how little we had expected--much less prepared\r\nfor--war in July, 1914. When, in the spring of 1914, Tsar Nicholas II\r\nwas questioned by his Court Marshal as to his spring and summer plans,\r\nhe replied: \"Je resterai chez moi cette année parceque nous aurons\r\nla guerre\" (\"I shall stay at home this year because we shall have\r\nwar\"). (This fact, it is said, was reported to Imperial Chancellor von\r\nBethmann; I heard nothing about it then and learned about it for the\r\nfirst time in November, 1918.) This was the same Tsar who gave me, on\r\ntwo separate occasions--at Björkö and Baltisch-Port--entirely without\r\nbeing pressed by me and in a way that surprised me, his word of honor\r\nas a sovereign, to which he added weight by a clasp of the hand and\r\nan embrace, that he would never draw his sword against the German\r\nEmperor--least of all as an ally of England--in case a war should break\r\nout in Europe, owing to his gratitude to the German Emperor for his\r\nattitude in the Russo-Japanese War, in which England alone had involved\r\nRussia, adding that he hated England, since she had done him and Russia\r\na great wrong by inciting Japan against them.\r\n\r\nAt the very time that the Tsar was announcing his summer war program I\r\nwas busy at Corfu excavating antiquities; then I went to Wiesbaden,\r\nand, finally, to Norway. A monarch who wishes war and prepares it\r\nin such a way that he can suddenly fall upon his neighbors--a task\r\nrequiring long secret mobilization preparations and concentration of\r\ntroops--does not spend months outside his own country and does not\r\nallow his Chief of the General Staff to go to Carlsbad on leave of\r\nabsence. My enemies, in the meantime, planned their preparations for an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nOur entire diplomatic machine failed. The menace of war was not seen\r\nbecause the Foreign Office was so hypnotized with its idea of \"surtout\r\npas d'histoires\" (\"above all, no stories\"), its belief in peace at any\r\ncost, that it had completely eliminated war as a possible instrument of\r\nEntente statesmanship from its calculations, and, therefore, did not\r\nrightly estimate the importance of the signs of war.\r\n\r\nHerein also is proof of Germany's peaceful inclinations. The\r\nabove-mentioned standpoint of the Foreign Office brought it to a\r\ncertain extent into conflict with the General Staff and the Admiralty\r\nStaff, who uttered warnings, as was their duty, and wished to make\r\npreparations for defense. This conflict in views showed its effect\r\nfor a long time; the army could not forget that, by the fault of the\r\nForeign Office, it had been taken by surprise, and the diplomats were\r\npiqued because, in spite of their stratagems, war had ensued, after all.\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the pieces of evidence that as early as the spring\r\nand summer of 1914, when nobody in Germany believed as yet in the\r\nEntente's attack, war had been prepared for in Russia, France,\r\nBelgium, and England.\r\n\r\nI included the most important proofs of this, in so far as they are\r\nknown to me, in the _Comparative Historical Tables_ compiled by me.\r\nOn account of their great number, I shall cite only a few here. If in\r\nso doing I do not mention all names, this is done for reasons easily\r\nunderstood. Let me remark furthermore that this whole mass of material\r\nbecame known to me only little by little, partly during the war, mostly\r\nafter the war.\r\n\r\n    1. As far back as April, 1914, the accumulation of gold reserves\r\n    in the English banks began. On the other hand, Germany, as late as\r\n    July, was still exporting gold and grain; to the Entente countries,\r\n    among others.\r\n\r\n    2. In April, 1914, the German Naval Attaché in Tokyo, Captain von\r\n    Knorr, reported that he was greatly struck by the certainty with\r\n    which everyone there foresaw a war of the Triple Alliance against\r\n    Germany in the near future ... that there was a something in the\r\n    air as if, so to speak, people were expressing their condolences\r\n    over a death sentence not yet pronounced.\r\n\r\n    3. At the end of March, 1914, General Sherbatsheff, director of\r\n    the St. Petersburg War Academy, made an address to his officers,\r\n    wherein, among other things, he said: That war with the powers\r\n    forming the Triple Alliance had become unavoidable on account\r\n    of Austria's anti-Russian Balkan policy; that there existed the\r\n    strongest sort of probability that it would break out as early as\r\n    that same summer; that, for Russia, it was a point of honor to\r\n    assume the offensive immediately.\r\n\r\n    4. In the report of the Belgian ambassador at Berlin regarding a\r\n    Japanese military mission which had arrived from St. Petersburg in\r\n    April, 1914, it was stated, among other things: At the regimental\r\n    messes the Japanese officers had heard quite open talk of an\r\n    imminent war against Austria-Hungary and Germany; it was stated,\r\n    however, that the army was ready to take the field, and that the\r\n    moment was as auspicious for the Russians as for their allies, the\r\n    French.\r\n\r\n    5. According to the memoirs of the then French ambassador at St.\r\n    Petersburg, M. Paléologue, published in 1921, in the _Revue des\r\n    Deux Mondes_, the Grand Duchesses Anastasia and Militza told him\r\n    on July 22, 1914, at Tsarskoe Selo, that their father, the King of\r\n    Montenegro, had informed them, in a cipher telegram, that \"we shall\r\n    have war before the end of the month [that is, before the 13th of\r\n    August, Russian style]; ... nothing will be left of Austria....\r\n    You will take back Alsace-Lorraine.... Our armies will meet in\r\n    Berlin.... Germany will be annihilated.\"\r\n\r\n    6. The former Serbian Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, Bogitshevich,\r\n    tells in his book, _Causes of the War_, published in 1919, of the\r\n    following statement which Cambon, the then French ambassador at\r\n    Berlin, made to him on the 26th or 27th of July, 1914: \"If Germany\r\n    wishes matters to come to a war, she will have England also against\r\n    her. The English fleet will take Hamburg. We shall thoroughly beat\r\n    the Germans.\" Bogitshevich states that this talk made him sure\r\n    that the war had been decided upon at the time of the meeting of\r\n    Poincaré with the Russian Tsar at St. Petersburg, if not sooner.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN CROWN COUNCIL\r\n\r\n    7. Another Russian of high rank, a member of the Duma and a good\r\n    friend of Sazonoff, told me later about the secret Crown Council\r\n    held, with the Tsar presiding, in February, 1914; moreover, I\r\n    obtained corroboration, from other Russian sources mentioned in\r\n    my _Historical Tables_, of the following: At this Crown Council\r\n    Sazonoff made an address wherein he suggested to the Tsar to\r\n    seize Constantinople, which, since the Triple Alliance would not\r\n    acquiesce in it, would cause a war against Germany and Austria. He\r\n    added that Italy would break away from these two, in the natural\r\n    course of events; that France was to be trusted absolutely and\r\n    England probably.\r\n\r\n    The Tsar had agreed, it was said, and given orders to take the\r\n    necessary preliminary steps. The Russian Finance Minister, Count\r\n    Kokovzeff, wrote to the Tsar advising against this course--I\r\n    was informed of this by Count Mirbach after the peace of\r\n    Brest-Litovsk--recommending a firm union with Germany and warning\r\n    against war, which, he said, would be unfavorable to Russia and\r\n    lead to revolution and the fall of the dynasty. The Tsar did not\r\n    follow this advice, but pushed on toward war.\r\n\r\n    The same gentleman told me this: _Two_ days after the outbreak\r\n    of war he had been invited by Sazonoff to breakfast. The latter\r\n    came up to him, beaming with joy, and, rubbing his hands together,\r\n    asked: \"Come now, my dear Baron, you must admit that I have chosen\r\n    the moment for war excellently, haven't I?\" When the Baron, rather\r\n    worried, asked him what stand England would take, the Minister\r\n    smote his pocket, and, with a sly wink, whispered: \"I have\r\n    something in my pocket which, within the next few weeks, will bring\r\n    joy to all Russia and astound the entire world; I have received the\r\n    English promise that England will go with Russia against Germany!\"\r\n\r\n    8. Russian prisoners belonging to the _Siberian_ Corps, who were\r\n    taken in East Prussia, said that they had been transported by rail\r\n    in the summer of 1913, to the vicinity of Moscow, since maneuvers\r\n    were to be held there by the Tsar. The maneuvers did not take\r\n    place, but the troops were not taken back. They were stationed for\r\n    the winter in the vicinity of Moscow. In the summer of 1914 they\r\n    were brought forward to the vicinity of Vilna, since big maneuvers\r\n    were to be held there by the Tsar; at and near Vilna they were\r\n    deployed and then, suddenly, the sharp cartridges (war ammunition)\r\n    were distributed and they were informed that there was a war\r\n    against Germany; they were unable to say why and wherefore.\r\n\r\n    9. In a report, made public in the press, during the winter of\r\n    1914-15; by an American, concerning his trip through the Caucasus\r\n    in the spring of 1914, the following was stated: When he arrived\r\n    in the Caucasus, at the beginning of _May_, 1914, he met, while\r\n    on his way to Tiflis, long columns of troops of all arms, in war\r\n    equipment. He had feared that a revolt had broken out in the\r\n    Caucasus. When he made inquiries of the authorities at Tiflis,\r\n    while having his passport inspected, he received the quieting\r\n    news that the Caucasus was quite peaceful, that he might travel\r\n    wheresoever he wished, that what he had seen had to do only with\r\n    practice marching and maneuvers.\r\n\r\n    At the close of his trip at the end of May, 1914, he wished to\r\n    embark at a Caucasian port, but all the vessels there were so\r\n    filled with troops that only after much trouble could he manage to\r\n    get a cabin for himself and his wife. The Russian officers told him\r\n    that they were to land at Odessa and march from there to take part\r\n    in some great maneuvers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COSSACK'S TESTIMONY\r\n\r\n    10. Prince Tundutoff, Hetman of the Calmuck Cossacks living\r\n    between Tsaritsin and Astrakhan, who was, before and during the\r\n    war, personal aid of the Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch, came\r\n    to General Headquarters at Bosmont in 1918, seeking to establish\r\n    connection with Germany, since the Cossacks were not Slavs at all\r\n    and thoroughly hostile to the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\n    He stated that he had been sent by Nicholas Nicholaievitch, before\r\n    the outbreak of war, to the General Staff, in order to keep the\r\n    Grand Duke posted on happenings there and that he had been a\r\n    witness of the notorious telephone talks between the Tsar and the\r\n    Chief of the General Staff, General Januskevitch; that the Tsar,\r\n    deeply impressed by the earnest telegram of the German Emperor,\r\n    had resolved to forbid mobilization and had ordered Januskevitch\r\n    by telephone not to carry out mobilization, _i. e._, to break\r\n    it off; that the latter had not obeyed the unmistakable order,\r\n    but had inquired by telephone of Sazonoff, Minister of Foreign\r\n    Affairs--with whom, for weeks, he had kept in touch, intrigued and\r\n    incited to war--what he was to do now; that Sazonoff had answered\r\n    that the Tsar's order was nonsense, that all the General need do\r\n    was to carry out mobilization, that he [Sazonoff] would bring the\r\n    Tsar around again next day and talk him out of heeding the stupid\r\n    telegram from the German Emperor; that, thereupon, Januskevitch had\r\n    informed the Tsar that mobilization was already under way and could\r\n    no longer be broken off.\r\n\r\n    Prince Tundutoff added: \"This was a lie, for I myself saw the\r\n    mobilization order lying beside Januskevitch on his writing table,\r\n    which shows that it had not as yet been given out at all.\"\r\n\r\n    The psychologically interesting point about the above is that Tsar\r\n    Nicholas, who helped prepare the World War and had already ordered\r\n    mobilization, wished to recede at the last moment. My earnest,\r\n    warning telegram, it seems, made him realize clearly for the first\r\n    time the colossal responsibility which he was bringing upon himself\r\n    by his warlike preparations. Therefore, he wished to stop the war\r\n    machine, the murderer of entire peoples, which he had just set in\r\n    motion. This would have been possible and peace might have been\r\n    preserved if Sazonoff had not frustrated his wish.\r\n\r\n    When I asked whether the Grand Duke, who was known as a\r\n    German-hater, had incited much to war, the Cossack chief replied\r\n    that the Grand Duke had certainly worked zealously for war, but\r\n    that incitement on his part would have been superfluous, since\r\n    there was already a strong sentiment against Germany all through\r\n    the Russian officer corps; that this spirit was transmitted,\r\n    principally, from the French army to the Russian officers; that\r\n    there had been a desire, in fact, to go to war in 1908-09 (Bosnian\r\n    Question), but France was not then ready; that, in 1914, Russia,\r\n    likewise, was not quite ready; that Januskevitch and Sukhomlinoff\r\n    had really planned the war for 1917, but Sazonoff and Isvolsky, as\r\n    well as the French, could not be restrained any longer; that the\r\n    former two were afraid of revolution in Russia and of the influence\r\n    of the German Emperor on the Tsar, which might dissuade the Tsar\r\n    from the idea of waging war; and that the French, who were sure,\r\n    for the time being, of England's help, were afraid that England\r\n    might come to an understanding later on with Germany at the expense\r\n    of France.\r\n\r\n    When I asked whether the Tsar had been aware of the warlike spirit\r\n    in Russia and had tolerated it, the Cossack Prince answered that it\r\n    was worthy of note that the Tsar had forbidden once for all, as a\r\n    matter of precaution, the inviting of German diplomats or military\r\n    attachés to luncheons or evening meals given by Russian officers at\r\n    which he himself was to be present.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORES OF ENGLISH COATS\r\n\r\n    11. When our troops advanced in 1914 they found, in northern France\r\n    and along the Belgian frontier, great stores of English soldiers'\r\n    greatcoats. According to statements by the inhabitants, these were\r\n    placed there during the _last years of peace_. Most of the English\r\n    infantrymen who were made prisoners by us in the summer of 1914\r\n    had no greatcoats; when asked why, they answered, quite naïvely:\r\n    \"We are to find our greatcoats in the stores at Maubeuge, Le\r\n    Quesnoy, etc., in the north of France and in Belgium.\"\r\n\r\n    It was the same regarding maps. In Maubeuge great quantities of\r\n    English military maps of northern France and Belgium were found\r\n    by our men; copies of these have been shown to me. The names of\r\n    places were printed in French and English, and all sorts of words\r\n    were translated in the margin for the convenience of soldiers;\r\n    for instance: moulin=mill, pont=bridge, maison=house, ville=town,\r\n    bois=wood, etc. These maps date from 1911 and were engraved at\r\n    Southampton.\r\n\r\n    The stores were established by England, with the permission of the\r\n    French and Belgian Governments, _before_ the war, in the midst of\r\n    peace. What a tempest of horror would have broken out in Belgium,\r\n    the \"neutral country,\" and what a rumpus England and France would\r\n    have kicked up, if we had wished to establish stores of German\r\n    soldiers' greatcoats and maps in Spa, Liège, and Namur!\r\n\r\n    Among the statesmen who, besides Poincaré, particularly helped\r\n    unleash the World War, the Sazonoff-Isvolsky group probably should\r\n    take first rank. Isvolsky, it is said, when at Paris, proudly\r\n    placed his hand upon his breast and declared: \"I made the war. Je\r\n    suis le père de cette guerre\" (\"I am the father of this war\").\r\n\r\n    Delcassé also has a large share in the guilt for the World War, and\r\n    Grey an even larger share, since he was the spiritual leader of\r\n    the \"encirclement policy,\" which he faithfully pushed forward and\r\n    brought to completion, as the \"legacy\" of his dead sovereign.\r\n\r\nI have been informed that an important rôle was played in the\r\npreparation of the World War directed against the monarchical Central\r\nPowers by the policy of the international \"Great Orient Lodge\";\r\na policy extending over many years and always envisaging the goal\r\nat which it aimed. But the German Great Lodges, I was furthermore\r\ntold--with two exceptions wherein non-German financial interests\r\nare paramount and which maintain secret connection with the \"Great\r\nOrient\" in Paris--had no relationship to the \"Great Orient.\" They\r\nwere entirely loyal and faithful, according to the assurance given me\r\nby the distinguished German Freemason who explained to me this whole\r\ninterrelationship, which had, until then, been unknown to me. He said\r\nthat in 1917 an international meeting of the lodges of the \"Great\r\nOrient\" was held, after which there was a subsequent conference in\r\nSwitzerland; at this the following program was adopted: Dismemberment\r\nof Austria-Hungary, democratization of Germany, elimination of the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg, abdication of the German Emperor, restitution of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine to France, union of Galicia with Poland, elimination of\r\nthe Pope and the Catholic Church, elimination of every state Church in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nI am not now in a position to investigate the very damaging information\r\nwhich has been transmitted to me, in the best of faith, concerning the\r\norganization and activities of the Great Orient Lodges. Secret and\r\npublic political organizations have played important parts in the life\r\nof peoples and states, ever since history has existed. Some of them\r\nhave been beneficial: most of them have been destructive, if they had\r\nto have secret passwords which shunned the light of day. The most\r\ndangerous of these organizations hide under the cloak of some ideal\r\nobject or other--such as active love of their neighbors, readiness\r\nto help the weak, and poor, and so forth--in order that, with such\r\npretexts as a blind, they may work for their real secret ends. It\r\nis certainly advisable to study the activities of the Great Orient\r\nLodges, since one cannot adopt a final attitude toward this worldwide\r\norganization until it has been thoroughly investigated.\r\n\r\nI shall not take up the war operations in this work. I shall leave this\r\ntask all the more readily to my officers and to the historians, since\r\nI, writing as I am without a single document, would be able to describe\r\nevents only in very broad outline.\r\n\r\nWhen I look back upon the four arduous war years, with their hopes and\r\nfears, their brilliant victories and losses in precious blood, what is\r\nuppermost in my mind is the feeling of ardent gratitude and undying\r\nadmiration for the unequaled achievements of the German Nation in arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROUD OF GERMAN ARMY\r\n\r\nJust as no sacrifice in endurance and privation was too great for those\r\nstaying at home, so also the army, in defending itself during the\r\nwar criminally forced upon us, did not merely overcome the crushing\r\nsuperiority of twenty-eight hostile nations, but likewise, on land and\r\nwater and in the air, won victories whose glory may have paled a bit\r\nin the mists of the present day, but, for that very reason, will shine\r\nforth all the more brightly in the light of history. Nor is that all.\r\nWherever there was distress among our allies, German intervention,\r\noften with weak forces, always restored the situation and often won\r\nnoteworthy successes. Germans fought on all the battlefields of the\r\nfar-flung World War.\r\n\r\nSurely the heroic bravery of the German nation deserved a better fate\r\nthan to fall a victim to the dagger that treacherously stabbed it from\r\nbehind; it seems to be the German destiny that Germans shall always be\r\ndefeated by Germans. Recently I read the unfortunately not entirely\r\nunjustified words: \"In Germany every Siegfried has his Hödur behind\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, let me say a word concerning the German \"atrocities\" and give\r\ntwo instances thereof!\r\n\r\nAfter our advance into northern France I immediately ordered that art\r\ntreasures be protected. Art historians and professors were assigned to\r\neach army, who traveled about inspecting, photographing, and describing\r\nchurches, châteaux, and castles. Among them Professor Clemen, Curator\r\nof the Rhine Province, especially distinguished himself and reported to\r\nme, when I was at the front, on the protection of art treasures.\r\n\r\nAll the collections in towns, museums, and castles were catalogued and\r\nnumbered; whenever they seemed to be imperiled by the fighting they\r\nwere taken away and assembled, at Valenciennes and Maubeuge, in two\r\nsplendid museums. There they were carefully preserved and the name of\r\nthe owner marked on each article.\r\n\r\nThe old windows of the cathedral of St. Quentin were removed by German\r\nsoldiers, at the risk of their lives, under English shell-fire. The\r\nstory of the destruction of the church by the English was told by a\r\nGerman Catholic priest, who published it with photographs, and it was\r\nsent, by my orders, to the Pope.\r\n\r\nAt the château of Pinon, which belongs to the Princess of Poix, who had\r\nbeen a guest of mine and the Empress, the headquarters of the general\r\ncommanding the Third Army Corps was located. I visited the château and\r\nlived there. Previously the English had been quartered there and had\r\nravaged the place terribly. The commanding general, von Lochow, and his\r\nstaff had a great deal of trouble getting it into some sort of shape\r\nagain after the devastation wrought by the English.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the general, I visited the private apartments of the\r\nPrincess, which, up to then, our soldiers had been forbidden to enter.\r\nI found that her entire wardrobe had been thrown out of the clothes\r\npresses by the English soldiers and, together with her hats, was lying\r\nabout on the floor. I had every garment carefully cleaned, hung in the\r\npresses, and locked up. The writing desk had also been broken into and\r\nthe Princess's correspondence was scattered about. At my command, all\r\nthe letters were gathered together, sealed in a package, placed in the\r\nwriting desk, and locked up.\r\n\r\nAfterward, all the silverware was found buried in the garden.\r\nAccording to the villagers this had been ordered as early as the\r\n_beginning of July_, so the Princess had known about the war long\r\nbefore its outbreak! I at once ordered that the silver be inventoried,\r\ndeposited in the bank at Aix-la-Chapelle, and returned to the Princess\r\nafter the war. Through neutral channels I caused news to be transmitted\r\nto the Princess in Switzerland, by my Court Marshal, Freiherr von\r\nReischach, concerning Pinon, her silverware, and my care for her\r\nproperty. No answer was received. Instead, the Princess had published\r\nin the French press a letter to the effect that General von Kluck had\r\nstolen all her silver.\r\n\r\nOn account of my care and the self-sacrificing work of German art\r\nexperts and soldiers--partly at the risk of their lives--art treasures\r\nworth billions were preserved for their French owners and for French\r\ntowns. This was done by the Huns, the boches!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe Pope and Peace\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1917 I received at Krueznach a visit from the Papal\r\nNuncio, Pacelli, who was accompanied by a chaplain. Pacelli is a\r\ndistinguished, likable man, of high intelligence and excellent manners,\r\nthe perfect pattern of an eminent prelate of the Catholic Church. He\r\nknows German well enough to understand it easily when he hears it, but\r\nnot sufficiently to speak it with fluency.\r\n\r\nOur conversation was conducted in French, but the Nuncio now and then\r\nemployed German expressions of speech. The chaplain spoke German\r\nfluently and took part--even when not asked--in the conversation,\r\nwhenever he feared that the Nuncio was becoming too much influenced by\r\nwhat I said.\r\n\r\nVery soon the conversation turned on the possibility of peace mediation\r\nand the bringing about of peace, in which connection all sorts of\r\nprojects and possibilities were touched upon, discussed, and dismissed.\r\n\r\nFinally, I suggested that the Pope should make an effort, seeing that\r\nmy peace offer of December 12, 1916, had been rejected in such an\r\nunprecedented manner. The Nuncio remarked that he thought such a step\r\nwould be attended with great difficulties; that the Pope had already\r\nbeen rebuffed when he had made certain advances in this direction;\r\nthat, aside from this, the Pope was absolutely in despair on account of\r\nthe slaughter and wondered ceaselessly how he might help toward freeing\r\nthe world and European culture from the scourge of war. Any suggestion\r\nas to this, he added, would be most valuable to the Vatican.\r\n\r\nI stated that the Pope, as the highest in rank among all the priests of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Christians and Church, should, first of all, seek\r\nto issue instructions to his priests in all countries to banish hate,\r\nonce for all, from their minds, since hate was the greatest obstacle in\r\nthe path of the peace idea; that it was, unfortunately, true that the\r\nclergy in the Entente countries were, to a positively frightful extent,\r\nthe standard-bearers and instigators of hate and fighting.\r\n\r\nI called attention to the numerous reports from soldiers at the\r\nbeginning of the war concerning abbés and parish priests captured with\r\narms in their hands; to the machinations of Cardinal Mercier and the\r\nBelgian clergy, members of which often worked as spies; to the sermon\r\nof the Protestant Bishop of London, who, from the pulpit, glorified the\r\n\"Baralong\" murderers; and to other similar cases. I added that it would\r\nbe, therefore, a great achievement if the Pope should succeed in having\r\nthe Roman Catholic clergy in all the countries at war condemn hatred\r\nand recommend peace, as was already being done by the German clergy, be\r\nit from the pulpit or by means of pastoral letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nURGES PAPAL INTERCESSION\r\n\r\nPacelli found this idea excellent and worthy of attention, but he\r\nremarked that it would be difficult to enlist the efforts of the\r\nvarious prelates in its support. I replied that, in view of the severe\r\ndiscipline of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, I could not\r\nimagine that, if the Pope should solemnly call upon the prelates of the\r\nChurch to preach reconciliation and consideration for the foe, those\r\nof any country whatsoever should refuse obedience; that the prelates,\r\non account of their eminent rank, were above all parties, and, since\r\nreconciliation and love of our neighbor were fundamental principles\r\nof the Christian religion, they were absolutely in duty bound to work\r\ntoward making people observe these principles.\r\n\r\nPacelli agreed to this and promised to give the idea his earnest\r\nattention and report upon it to the Vatican. In the further course\r\nof the conversation, the Nuncio asked what form--beyond the purely\r\necclesiastical step suggested by me--the bringing about of peace\r\npossibilities through the intervention of the Pope might take. I\r\npointed out that Italy and Austria were two Roman Catholic states, upon\r\nwhich the Pope could bring influence to bear easily and effectively;\r\nthat one of these lands was his native country and place of residence,\r\nin which he was greatly revered by the people and exerted direct\r\ninfluence upon his fellow countrymen; that Austria was ruled by a\r\nsovereign who actually bore the title \"apostolic\"; who, with all his\r\nfamily, had direct relations with the Vatican and was among the most\r\nfaithful adherents of the Catholic Church; that I was, therefore, of\r\nthe opinion that it would not be difficult for the Pope to try at least\r\nto make a beginning with these two countries and cause them to talk\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nI added that the diplomatic skill and wide vision of the Vatican were\r\nknown the world over; that, if once a beginning were made in this\r\nway--and it had a good chance of success--the other Powers could\r\nscarcely refuse an invitation from the Vatican later on to an exchange\r\nof views, which should be, at first, not binding upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Nuncio remarked that it would be difficult for the Vatican to make\r\nthe Italian Government agree to such a thing, since it had no direct\r\nrelation with the said Government and no influence upon its members;\r\nthat the Italian Government would never look with favor upon an\r\ninvitation, even to mere conferences.\r\n\r\nHere the chaplain interposed that such a step by the Pope was\r\nabsolutely out of the question, since it would entail consequences\r\nwhich might be actually dangerous to the Vatican; the Government\r\nwould at once mobilize the \"piazza\" (\"man in the street\") against the\r\nVatican, and the Vatican certainly could not expose itself to that.\r\nWhen I refused to attach importance to this objection, the chaplain\r\ngrew more and more excited. He said that I did not know the Romans;\r\nthat, when they were incited they were simply terrible; that just as\r\nsoon as the \"piazza\" got into action things would get disagreeable;\r\nthat, if it did, there was even a possibility of an attack on the\r\nVatican, which might actually imperil the life of the Pope himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOUTS DANGER FROM \"PIAZZA\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I, too, was well acquainted with the Vatican; that no\r\nrabble or \"piazza\" could storm it; that, in addition, the Pope had a\r\nstrong party of adherents in society circles and among the people,\r\nwhich would at once be ready to defend him. The Nuncio agreed with me,\r\nbut the chaplain continued unabashed to expatiate upon the terrors of\r\nthe \"piazza\" and paint the risks run by the Pope in the blackest of\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nI then remarked that anyone wishing to capture the Vatican must first\r\nget a battery of heavy mortars and howitzers, as well as pioneers and\r\nstorm troops, and institute a regular siege; that all this was scarcely\r\npossible for the \"piazza\"; that, therefore, it was highly improbable\r\nthat the latter would undertake anything. Moreover, I mentioned having\r\nheard that measures had already been taken in the Vatican to guard\r\nagainst such an emergency. At this the priest was silent.\r\n\r\nThe Nuncio then remarked that it was difficult for the Pope to do\r\nanything really practical toward peace without giving offense and\r\narousing opposition in lay Italy, which would place him in danger;\r\nthat it must be borne in mind that he was, unfortunately, not free;\r\nthat had the Pope a country, or at least a district of his own where he\r\ncould govern autonomously and do as he pleased, the situation would be\r\nquite different; that, as matters stood, he was too dependent upon lay\r\nRome and not able to act according to his own free will.\r\n\r\nI remarked that the aim of bringing peace to the world was so holy and\r\ngreat that it was impossible for the Pope to be frightened away, by\r\npurely worldly considerations, from accomplishing such a task, which\r\nseemed created especially for him; that, should he succeed in it, the\r\ngrateful world would assuredly bring influence to bear upon the Italian\r\nGovernment in support of his wishes and of his independence.\r\n\r\nThis made an impression on the Nuncio; he remarked that I was right,\r\nafter all; that the Pope must do something in the matter.\r\n\r\nThen I called the attention of the Nuncio to the following point: He\r\nmust have noticed, I said, how the Socialists of all countries were\r\nzealously working in favor of peace efforts. I told him that we had\r\nalways allowed the German Socialists to travel to foreign parts in\r\norder to discuss the question of making peace at conferences, because I\r\nbelieved them to be acquainted with the desires and views of the lower\r\nclasses; that we placed no obstacles in the path of anybody desiring\r\nto work honestly and without veiled purpose in the interests of peace;\r\nthat the same desires for peace also existed among the Entente nations\r\nand among their Socialists, but that the latter were prevented by\r\nrefusal of passports from attending congresses in neutral lands; that\r\nthe desire for peace was gaining strength in the world, nations were\r\nacquiring it more and more, and if nobody in any Government should\r\nbe found willing to work for peace--I, unfortunately, had failed in\r\nmy attempt--the peoples would finally take the matter into their own\r\nhands. I added that this would not occur without serious shocks and\r\nrevolutions, as history proved, through which the Roman Church and the\r\nPope would not come unscathed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINS PROMISE OF ACTION\r\n\r\nWhat must a Catholic soldier think, I asked, when he reads always of\r\nefforts by Socialists only, never of an effort by the Pope, to free him\r\nfrom the horrors of war? If the Pope did nothing, I continued, there\r\nwas danger of peace being forced upon the world by the Socialists,\r\nwhich would mean the end of the power of the Pope and the Roman Church,\r\neven among Catholics!\r\n\r\nThis argument struck home to the Nuncio. He stated that he would at\r\nonce report it to the Vatican and give it his support; that the Pope\r\nwould have to act.\r\n\r\nGreatly worried, the chaplain again interposed, remarking that the Pope\r\nwould endanger himself by such a course; that the \"piazza\" would attack\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTo this I replied that I was a Protestant, and, hence, a heretic in\r\nthe chaplain's eyes, notwithstanding which I was obliged to point\r\nout that the Pope was designated the \"Viceroy of Christ upon earth\"\r\nby the Catholic Church and world; that I had, in studying the Holy\r\nScriptures, occupied myself earnestly and carefully with the person of\r\nthe Saviour and sought to immerse myself profoundly therein; that the\r\nLord had never feared the \"piazza,\" although no fortresslike building,\r\nwith guards and weapons, was at His disposal; that the Lord had always\r\nwalked into the midst of the \"piazza,\" spoken to it, and finally gone\r\nto His death on the Cross for the sake of this hostile \"piazza.\"\r\n\r\nWas I now to believe, I asked, that His \"Viceroy upon earth\" was afraid\r\nof the possibility of becoming a martyr, like his Lord, in order to\r\nbring peace to the bleeding world, all on account of the ragged Roman\r\n\"piazza\"? I, the Protestant, thought far too highly of a Roman priest,\r\nparticularly of the Pope, to believe such a thing. Nothing could be\r\nmore glorious for him, I went on, than to devote himself unreservedly,\r\nbody and soul, to the great cause of peace, even despite the remote\r\ndanger of thus becoming a martyr!\r\n\r\nWith shining eyes, the Nuncio grasped my hand and said, deeply moved:\r\n\"Vous avez parfaitement raison! C'est le devoir du Pape; il faut qu'il\r\nagisse; c'est par lui que le monde doit être régagné à la paix. Je\r\ntransmettrai vos paroles à Sa Sainteté\" (\"You are absolutely right!\r\nIt is the duty of the Pope; he must act; it is through him that the\r\nworld must be won back to peace. I shall transmit your words to His\r\nHoliness\").\r\n\r\nThe chaplain turned away, shaking his head, and murmured to himself:\r\n\"Ah, la piazza, la piazza!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nEnd of the War and My Abdication\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after August 8, 1918, I summoned a Crown Council, in order\r\nto get a clear conception of the situation and to draw therefrom the\r\nnecessary conclusions upon which to base the policy to be followed\r\nby Count Hertling. The Chief Military Command approved the idea\r\nthat the Imperial Chancellor should keep in sight the possibility\r\nof getting into closer touch with the enemy, but laid stress on the\r\nnecessity of first occupying the Siegfried line and there thoroughly\r\nbeating off the foe, and on the fact that negotiations must not begin\r\nbefore this occurred. Thereupon I directed that the Chancellor get\r\ninto communication with a neutral power--the Netherlands--in order\r\nto ascertain whether it was ready to undertake such a step toward\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\nWhat rendered the contemplated action through Dutch channels very\r\ndifficult was that Austria could not be brought to a definite\r\nagreement, but continually postponed the declaration which had been\r\nrequested of her. Even a verbal agreement given to me by the Emperor\r\nCharles was afterward broken by him under Burian's influence.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government had already been informed by me and had signified\r\nits readiness to act. Meanwhile, Austria, without notifying us, made\r\nher first separate peace offer, which set the ball rolling. The Emperor\r\nCharles had indeed got into touch secretly with the Entente and had\r\nlong since resolved to abandon us. He acted according to the plan which\r\nhe had explained thus to his entourage: \"When I go to the Germans, I\r\nagree to everything they say, and when I return home, I do whatever I\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nThus it happened that my government and I were constantly deceived by\r\nactions in Vienna, without being able to do anything against it, since\r\nfrom there we constantly received the hint: \"If you make things hard\r\nfor us, we shall leave you in the lurch; in other words, our army will\r\nno longer fight by your side.\" In view of our situation, such action on\r\nAustria's part had to be avoided in any way possible, both on military\r\nand political grounds.\r\n\r\nThe defection of Hungary and Austria brought a crisis upon us. Had\r\nEmperor Charles kept control of his nerves for three weeks longer, many\r\nthings would have turned out differently. But Andrassy--as he himself\r\nadmitted--had been negotiating for a long time in Switzerland, behind\r\nour backs, with the Entente. Thus Emperor Charles believed that he\r\nwould assure himself of good treatment at the hands of the Entente.\r\n\r\nAfter our failure of August 8th, General Ludendorff had declared\r\nthat he could no longer guarantee a military victory. Therefore,\r\nthe preparation of peace negotiations was necessary. Since diplomacy\r\nhad not succeeded in initiating any promising negotiations and the\r\nmilitary situation had become even worse in the meantime, on account of\r\nrevolutionary agitation, Ludendorff, on the 29th of September, demanded\r\nthat preparations be made for an armistice instead of for peace\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT FOR ABDICATION\r\n\r\nAt this critical time a strong movement began at home in favor of\r\nsetting up a new government for the now necessary termination of the\r\nwar. I could not ignore this movement, since the old government, during\r\nthe seven weeks from August 8th to the end of September, had not\r\nmanaged to initiate peace negotiations offering any hope of success.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General von Gallwitz and General von Mudra, summoned from\r\nthe front, appeared before me. They gave a picture of the inner\r\nsituation of the army, laying due emphasis upon the great number of\r\nshirkers behind the front, the frequency of insubordination, the\r\ndisplaying of the red flag upon trains filled with soldiers returning\r\nfrom furloughs at home and other similar phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe two generals considered that the principal cause of the bad\r\nconditions was to be sought in the unfavorable influence exerted upon\r\nthe soldiers by the spirit predominating behind the front and in the\r\ngeneral desire for ending the fighting and getting peace, which was\r\nspreading from the homeland along the lines of communication behind the\r\nfront and was already becoming noticeable even among some of the troops\r\nat the front itself. The generals advanced the opinion that, owing\r\nto these reasons, the army must immediately be withdrawn behind the\r\nAntwerp-Meuse line.\r\n\r\nOn that same day I commanded Field Marshal von Hindenburg by telephone\r\nto effect as soon as possible the retreat to the Antwerp-Meuse line.\r\nThe falling back of the tired, but nowhere decisively beaten, army to\r\nthis position merely signified occupying an essentially shorter line,\r\npossessing far greater natural advantages. It was not yet completed,\r\nto be sure, but the fact was to be borne in mind that we had engaged\r\nin battle on the Somme while occupying positions composed largely of\r\nshell craters. What we had to do was to regain operative freedom,\r\nwhich, to my way of thinking, was by no means impossible; in the course\r\nof the war, had we not often retreated in order to put ourselves in a\r\nsituation that was more advantageous from the military point of view?\r\n\r\nThe army, to be sure, was no longer the old army. The new 1918 troops\r\nparticularly were badly tainted with revolutionary propaganda and often\r\ntook advantage of the darkness at night to sneak away from the firing\r\nand vanish to the rear.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of my divisions fought flawlessly to the very end\r\nand preserved their discipline and military spirit. To the very end\r\nthey were always a match for the foe in morale; despite superiority in\r\nnumbers, cannon, munitions, tanks, and airplanes, the foe invariably\r\nsuccumbed when he ran up against serious resistance. Therefore, the\r\nassociations of our ex-fighters at the front are right in bearing upon\r\ntheir banners the motto: \"Unbeaten on land and sea!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAYS ARMY WAS STILL STRONG\r\n\r\nThe achievements of the German fighters at the front and of the German\r\nNation in arms, during four and a half years of war, are beyond\r\nall praise. One does not know what to admire most: the enthusiasm\r\nwith which the magnificent youth of 1914, without waiting for our\r\nartillery fire to take effect, joyfully charged on the enemy, or the\r\nself-sacrificing fidelity to duty and tenacity with which our men in\r\nfield gray, sparingly fed and seldom relieved, year in, year out,\r\ndigging by night, living in dugouts and earthholes by day, or crouching\r\nin shell holes, defied the hail of steel from the enemy artillery,\r\nflyers, and tanks. And this army, which one might have expected was to\r\nbe rated as utterly fought to a finish, was able, after nearly four\r\nyears of war, to carry out successful offensive operations such as our\r\nfoes could nowhere boast of, despite their colossal superiority.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, it was not right to believe the German army\r\ncapable of accomplishing the superhuman; it was necessary for us to\r\nfall back, in order to get breath.\r\n\r\nThe Field Marshal balked at the order to retreat; the army, he thought,\r\nshould stay where it was, for political reasons (peace negotiations and\r\nso on); he also pointed out, among other things, that it was necessary,\r\nfirst, to arrange for the withdrawal to the rear of war materials, etc.\r\n\r\nI now resolved to go to the front, acquiescing in the desire expressed\r\nto me by the army that I might be with my hard-fighting troops and\r\nconvince myself personally of their spirit and condition.\r\n\r\nI could carry out this resolve all the sooner in view of the fact that,\r\never since the new Government had been set up, no further claims were\r\nmade upon my time either by it or by the Imperial Chancellor, which\r\nmade my staying at home seem useless.\r\n\r\nThe notes to Wilson were discussed and written by Solf, the War\r\nCabinet, and the Reichstag, after sessions lasting hours, without my\r\nbeing informed thereof; until, finally, on the occasion of the last\r\nnote to Wilson, I caused Solf to be given to understand very plainly,\r\nthrough my chief of Cabinet, that I demanded to know about the note\r\n_before_ it was sent.\r\n\r\nSolf appeared and showed the note; he was proud of his antithesis\r\nbetween _laying down_ of arms (\"Waffenstreckung\"), which was demanded\r\nby Wilson, and _armistice_ (\"Waffenstillstand\"), which was proposed.\r\nWhen I spoke about the rumors of abdication and demanded that the\r\nForeign Office adopt an attitude, through the press, against what was\r\nunworthy in the newspaper polemics, Solf replied that already everybody\r\non every street corner was talking about abdication and that, even in\r\nthe best circles, people were discussing it quite unreservedly.\r\n\r\nWhen I expressed my indignation at this, Solf sought to console me by\r\nobserving that, should His Majesty go, he also would, since he could\r\nserve no longer under such conditions. I went, or--to put it much\r\nmore correctly--I was overthrown by my own Government, and--Herr Solf\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nWhen the Imperial Chancellor, Prince Max, heard of my resolve to\r\ngo to the front, he did all he could to prevent it. He asked why I\r\nwished to go and received the answer that I considered it my duty, as\r\nSupreme Commander, to return to the front, since I had been separated\r\nfor almost a month from the hard-fighting army. When the Chancellor\r\nobjected that I was indispensable at home, I retorted that we were at\r\nwar, that the Emperor belonged to his soldiers. Finally, I declared,\r\nonce for all, that I would go; that in case Wilson's armistice note\r\narrived, it would have to be discussed, anyhow, at the General\r\nHeadquarters of the army, for which purpose the Chancellor and other\r\nmembers of the Government would be obliged to go to Spa for the\r\nconferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"JOYFULLY RECEIVED\" BY ARMY\r\n\r\nI went to the army in Flanders, after having once more given the\r\nGeneral Staff at Spa definite orders to fall back as quickly as\r\npossible to the Antwerp-Meuse line, in order that the troops might\r\nfinally be taken out of the fighting and given a rest. Despite\r\nobjections that this would demand time, that the position was not yet\r\nready, that the war material must first be taken back, and so forth, I\r\nstood by the order. The retreat was begun.\r\n\r\nIn Flanders I saw delegations from the different divisions, spoke with\r\nthe soldiers, distributed decorations, and was everywhere joyfully\r\nreceived by officers and men. Particularly ardent enthusiasm reigned\r\namong the soldiers of a royal Saxon recruit depot, who greeted me\r\nwith wild cheers at the railway station when I was returning to my\r\ntrain. While I was giving out decorations to members of the Reserve\r\nGuard Division, an enemy bombing squadron, followed by heavy fire from\r\nanti-aircraft guns and machine guns, flew directly over us and dropped\r\nbombs near the special train.\r\n\r\nThe commanders of the army were unanimous in declaring that the spirit\r\nof the troops at the front was good and reliable; that, further to the\r\nrear, among the supply columns, it was not so good; that the worst of\r\nall were the soldiers back from leave, who, it was plain to be seen,\r\nhad been worked upon and infected at home, whence they had brought\r\nback a poor spirit. The young recruits at the depots, it was stated,\r\nfurthermore, were good.\r\n\r\nAt Spa, whither I now went, news came constantly from home about the\r\never more violent agitation and hostile attitude against the Emperor\r\nand the growing slackness and helplessness of the Government, which,\r\nwithout initiative or strength, was letting itself be pushed around\r\nat will. It was alluded to contemptuously in the newspapers as the\r\n\"debating society\" and Prince Max was called by leading newspapers the\r\n\"Revolution Chancellor.\" As I learned afterward, he lay in bed for ten\r\ndays, suffering from grippe and incapable of really directing affairs.\r\nHis Excellency von Payer and Solf, with the so-called War Cabinet,\r\nwhich was in permanent session, governed the German Empire.\r\n\r\nAt such a critical time, to my way of thinking, the imperiled ship\r\nof state should not be steered by representatives of the Imperial\r\nChancellor, since they certainly cannot have the authority possessed by\r\nthe responsible head of the Government. What was particularly needed at\r\nthis juncture was authority; yet, so far as I know, no wide powers to\r\nact had been conferred upon the Vice Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe right solution--_i. e._, the one that those concerned were in duty\r\nbound to adopt--would have been to remove Prince Max actually from\r\nthe post of Chancellor and summon in his place some man of strong\r\npersonality. Since we had the parliamentary form of government it\r\ndevolved upon the political parties to bring about the change in the\r\nChancellorship and present me with a successor to Prince Max. This did\r\nnot take place.\r\n\r\nNow the efforts of the Government and the Imperial Chancellor to induce\r\nme to abdicate began. Drews, the Minister of the Interior, came to me\r\nat the behest of the Chancellor, in order to supply me with information\r\nconcerning the spirit in the country. He described the well-known\r\nhappenings in press, high finance, and public, and laid emphasis on the\r\nfact that the Imperial Chancellor himself adopted no attitude toward\r\nthe question of my abdication, but, nevertheless, had sent him to me.\r\nDrews, in short, was to suggest to me that I myself should decide to\r\nabdicate, in order that it might not appear that the Government had\r\nexerted pressure upon me.\r\n\r\nI spoke to the Minister about the fateful consequences of my abdication\r\nand asked how he, as a Prussian official, could reconcile such a\r\nsupposition with his oath as an official to his King. The Minister grew\r\nembarrassed and excused himself by reference to the command of the\r\nImperial Chancellor, who had been unable to find any other man for the\r\ntask. I was informed later that Drews was one of the first officials\r\nwho spoke of the abdication of his master and King.\r\n\r\nI refused to abdicate and declared that I would gather troops together\r\nand return with them in order to help the Government to maintain order\r\nin the land.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Drews was received, in my presence, by Field Marshal\r\nvon Hindenburg and General Gröner, whom he informed of the mission\r\nintrusted to him by the Imperial Chancellor and by both of whom he was\r\nvery sharply rebuked in the name of the army. Gröner's characterization\r\nof Prince Max, in particular, was expressed in such plain terms that I\r\nhad to appease and comfort the Minister.\r\n\r\nThe Field Marshal also called Drews's attention to the fact that, in\r\nthe event of my abdication, the army would not go on fighting, but\r\nwould disperse, and that the majority of the officers, in particular,\r\nwould probably resign and thus leave the army without leaders.\r\n\r\nSoon after that I learned from one of my sons that the Imperial\r\nChancellor had tried to ascertain whether he was prepared to undertake\r\nthe mission which subsequently was undertaken by Drews. My son\r\nindignantly declined to suggest abdication to his father.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I had sent the chief of Cabinet, von Delbrück, to\r\nBerlin, in order to lay before the Chancellor a general address, also\r\nintended for publication, which should take the place of my address\r\nto the Ministry (not published by the Chancellor), deal more broadly\r\nwith the matters taken up therein, and make clear my attitude toward\r\nthe Government and toward the new direction taken by public opinion.\r\nAt first the Chancellor failed to publish this. Not until several days\r\nlater did he find himself forced to permit publication, owing to a\r\nletter written to him, as I learned afterward, by the Empress.\r\n\r\nThereupon Herr von Delbrück informed me that the address had made a\r\ngood impression in Berlin and in the press, relieved the situation,\r\nand tended to quiet the people, so that the idea of abdication had\r\nbegun to disappear and even the Socialists of the Right had decided to\r\npostpone action concerning it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIALIST ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days there were constant reports that the\r\nSocialists in Berlin were planning trouble and that the Chancellor\r\nwas growing steadily more nervous. The report given by Drews to the\r\nGovernment, after his return from Spa, had not failed to cause an\r\nimpression; the gentlemen wished to get rid of me, to be sure, but for\r\nthe time being they were afraid of the consequences.\r\n\r\nTheir point of view was as obscure as their conduct. They acted as\r\nif they did not want a republic, yet failed completely to realize\r\nthat their course was bound to lead straight to a republic. Many, in\r\nfact, explained the actions of the Government by maintaining that the\r\ncreation of a republic was the very end that its members had in view;\r\nplenty of people drew the conclusion, from the puzzling conduct of the\r\nChancellor toward me, that he was working to eliminate me in order to\r\nbecome himself President of the German Republic, after being, in the\r\ninterim, the administrator of the Empire.\r\n\r\nTo believe this is undoubtedly to do the Prince an injustice; such a\r\ntrain of thought is impossible in a man belonging to an old German\r\nprincely family.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gröner, who had gone to Berlin to study the situation, reported\r\non his return that he had received very bad impressions regarding the\r\nGovernment and the sentiment prevailing in the country; that things\r\nwere approaching revolution; that the Government was merely tearing\r\ndown without setting up anything positive; that the people wanted peace\r\nat last, at any cost, no matter what kind of peace; that the authority\r\nof the Government was equal to zero, the agitation against the Emperor\r\nin full swing, my abdication hardly to be avoided longer.\r\n\r\nHe added that the troops at home were unreliable and disagreeable\r\nsurprises might come in case of a revolt; that the courier chests of\r\nthe Russian Bolshevist ambassador, seized by the criminal police,\r\nhad disclosed some very damaging evidence that the Russian Embassy,\r\nin conjunction with the Spartacus group, had long since thoroughly\r\nprepared, without being disturbed, a Bolshevist revolution on the\r\nRussian model. (This had gone on with the knowledge of the Foreign\r\nOffice--which had received constant warning, but had either laughed at\r\nthem all or dismissed them with the remark that the Bolsheviki must\r\nnot be angered--likewise under the very eyes of the police, which was\r\ncontinually at loggerheads with the Foreign Office.) The men back from\r\nleave, he went on, infected by propaganda, had already carried the\r\npoison to the army, which was already partly affected and would, as\r\nsoon as it had been made free by an armistice, refuse to fight against\r\nthe rebels upon its return home.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he declared, it was necessary to accept, immediately\r\nand unconditionally, any sort of armistice, no matter how hard\r\nits conditions might be; the army was no longer to be trusted and\r\nrevolution was imminent behind the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCE MAX INSISTENT\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 9th of November,[9] the Imperial Chancellor,\r\nPrince Max of Baden, caused me to be informed again--as he had already\r\ndone on the 7th--that the Social Democrats, and also the Social\r\nDemocratic Secretaries of State, demanded my abdication; that the rest\r\nof the members of the Government, who had stood out so far against it,\r\nwere now in favor of it, and that the same was true of the majority\r\nparties in the Reichstag. For these reasons, he continued, he requested\r\nme to abdicate immediately, since, otherwise, extensive street fighting\r\nattended by bloodshed would take place in Berlin; it had already\r\nstarted on a small scale.\r\n\r\nI immediately summoned Field Marshal von Hindenburg and the\r\nQuartermaster General, General Gröner. General Gröner again announced\r\nthat the army could fight no longer and wished rest above all else,\r\nand that, therefore, any sort of armistice must be unconditionally\r\naccepted; that the armistice must be concluded as soon as possible,\r\nsince the army had supplies for only six to eight days more and was\r\ncut off from all further supplies by the rebels, who had occupied all\r\nthe supply storehouses and Rhine bridges; that, for some unexplained\r\nreason, the armistice commission sent to France--consisting\r\nof Erzberger, Ambassador Count Oberndorff, and General von\r\nWinterfeldt--which had crossed the French lines two evenings before,\r\nhad sent no report as to the nature of the conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince also appeared, with his Chief of Staff, Count\r\nSchulenburg, and took part in the conference. During our conversation\r\nseveral telephone inquiries came from the Imperial Chancellor, which,\r\npointing out that the Social Democrats had left the Government and\r\nthat delay was dangerous, became most insistent. The Minister of War\r\nreported uncertainty among part of the troops in Berlin--4th Jägers,\r\nSecond Company of Alexander Regiment, Second Battery, Jüterbog, gone\r\nover to the rebels--no street fighting.\r\n\r\nI wished to spare my people civil war. If my abdication was indeed the\r\nonly way to prevent bloodshed, I was willing to _renounce the Imperial\r\nthrone, but not to abdicate as King of Prussia_; I would remain, as\r\nsuch, with my troops, since the military leaders had declared that the\r\nofficers would leave in crowds if I abdicated entirely, and the army\r\nwould then pour back, without leaders, into the fatherland, damage it,\r\nand place it in peril.\r\n\r\nA reply had been sent to the Imperial Chancellor to the effect that my\r\ndecision must first be carefully weighed and formulated, after which\r\nit would be transmitted to the Chancellor. When, a little later, this\r\nwas done, there came the surprising answer that my decision had arrived\r\nlate! The Imperial Chancellor, on his own initiative, had summarily\r\nannounced my abdication--which had not occurred yet at all!--as well as\r\nrenunciation of the throne by the Crown Prince, who had not even been\r\nquestioned. He had turned over the Government to the Social Democrats\r\nand summoned Herr Ebert as Imperial Chancellor. All this had been\r\nspread simultaneously by wireless, so the entire army could read it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENIES HE FORSOOK FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\nThus the decision as to my going or staying, as to my renunciation of\r\nthe Imperial Crown and retention of the Royal Crown of Prussia, was\r\nsummarily snatched from me. The army was shaken to the core by the\r\nerroneous belief that its King had abandoned it at the most critical\r\nmoment of all.\r\n\r\nIf the conduct of the Imperial Chancellor, Prince Max of Baden, is\r\nconsidered as a whole, it appears as follows: first, solemn declaration\r\nthat he will place himself, together with the new Government, before\r\nthe Emperor's throne, to protect it; then, suppression of the address,\r\nwhich might have impressed public opinion favorably, elimination of\r\nthe Emperor from all co-operation in the Government, sacrifice of the\r\nrespect due the Emperor by suppression of the censorship, failure to\r\ncome to the support of the monarchy in the matter of abdication; then,\r\nattempts to persuade the Emperor to abdicate voluntarily; and, finally,\r\nannouncement of my abdication by wireless, in which the Chancellor went\r\nover my head.\r\n\r\nThis sequence of events shows the course--a perilous one to the\r\nnation--adopted by Scheidemann, who held the Chancellor in the hollow\r\nof his hand. Scheidemann left the Ministers, his colleagues, in the\r\ndark as to his real purposes, drove the Prince from one step to\r\nanother, and finally summoned Ebert, declaring that the leaders no\r\nlonger had the masses under control. Thus he caused the Prince to\r\nsacrifice the Emperor, the princes, and the Empire, and made him the\r\ndestroyer of the Empire. After that, Scheidemann overthrew the weak\r\nprincely \"statesman.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the arrival of the wireless message, the situation was\r\ndifficult. To be sure, troops were being transported to Spa for\r\nthe purpose of going on undisturbed with the work at Great General\r\nHeadquarters, but the Field Marshal now thought it no longer possible\r\nto reckon absolutely on their reliability in case rebellious forces\r\nshould advance from Aix-la-Chapelle and Cologne and confront our troops\r\nwith the dilemma of whether or not to fight against their own comrades.\r\nIn view of this, he advised me to leave the army and go to some neutral\r\ncountry, for the purpose of avoiding such a \"civil war.\"\r\n\r\nI went through a fearful internal struggle. On the one hand, I, as a\r\nsoldier, was outraged at the idea of abandoning my still faithful,\r\nbrave troops. On the other hand, there was the declaration of our foes\r\nthat they were unwilling to conclude with me any peace endurable to\r\nGermany, as well as the statement of my own Government that only by my\r\ndeparture for foreign parts was civil war to be prevented.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle I set aside all that was personal. I consciously\r\nsacrificed myself and my throne in the belief that, by so doing, I was\r\nbest serving the interests of my beloved fatherland. The sacrifice was\r\nin vain. My departure brought us neither better armistice conditions\r\nnor better peace terms; nor did it prevent civil war--on the contrary,\r\nit hastened and intensified, in the most pernicious manner, the\r\ndisintegration in the army and the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROUD OF THE ARMY\r\n\r\nFor thirty years the army was my pride. For it I lived, upon it I\r\nlabored. And now, after four and a half brilliant years of war with\r\nunprecedented victories, it was forced to collapse by the stab in the\r\nback from the dagger of the revolutionists, at the very moment when\r\npeace was within reach!\r\n\r\nAnd the fact that it was in my proud navy, my creation, that there was\r\nfirst open rebellion, cut me most deeply to the heart.\r\n\r\nThere has been much talk about my having abandoned the army and gone to\r\nneutral foreign parts.\r\n\r\nSome say the Emperor should have gone to some regiment at the front,\r\nhurled himself with it upon the enemy, and sought death in one last\r\nattack. That, however, would not only have rendered impossible the\r\narmistice, ardently desired by the nation, concerning which the\r\ncommission sent from Berlin to General Foch was already negotiating,\r\nbut would also have meant the useless sacrifice of the lives of many\r\nsoldiers--of some of the very best and most faithful, in fact.\r\n\r\nOthers say the Emperor should have returned home at the head of the\r\narmy. But a peaceful return was no longer possible; the rebels had\r\nalready seized the Rhine bridges and other important points in the\r\nrear of the army. I could, to be sure, have forced my way back at the\r\nhead of loyal troops taken from the fighting front; but, by so doing,\r\nI should have put the finishing touch to Germany's collapse, since,\r\nin addition to the struggle with the enemy, who would certainly have\r\npressed forward in pursuit, civil war would also have ensued.\r\n\r\nStill others say the Emperor should have killed himself. That was made\r\nimpossible by my firm Christian beliefs. And would not people have\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"How cowardly! Now he shirks all responsibility by committing suicide!\"\r\nThis alternative was also eliminated because I had to consider how to\r\nbe of help and use to my people and my country in the evil time that\r\nwas to be foreseen.\r\n\r\nI knew also that I was particularly called upon to champion the cause\r\nof my people in the clearing up of the question of war guilt--which\r\nwas disclosing itself more and more as the pivotal point in our\r\nfuture destiny--since I better than anyone else could bear witness to\r\nGermany's desire for peace and to our clean conscience.\r\n\r\nAfter unspeakably arduous soul struggles, and following the most urgent\r\nadvice of my counselors of the highest rank who were present at the\r\nmoment, I decided to leave the country, since, in view of the reports\r\nmade to me, I must needs believe that, by so doing, I should most\r\nfaithfully serve Germany, make possible better armistice and peace\r\nterms for her, and spare her further loss of human lives, distress, and\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n  [9] Concerning the course of events up to the fateful 9th of November\r\n      and this day itself there are authentic statements by an\r\n      eyewitness in the book (well worth reading) of Major Niemann, who\r\n      was sent by the Chief Army Command to me, entitled _War and\r\n      Revolution (Krieg und Revolution)_, Berlin, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe Enemy Tribunal and the Neutral Tribunal\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Entente's demand that I and the German army leaders should\r\nbe surrendered for trial before Entente tribunals became known, I\r\nimmediately asked myself whether I could be of use to my fatherland by\r\ngiving myself up before the German people and the German Government had\r\nexpressed themselves regarding this demand. It was clear to me that, in\r\nthe opinion of the Entente, such a surrender would so seriously shake\r\nthe prestige of Germany, as a state and people, for all time, that we\r\ncould never again take our place, with equal rights, equal dignity,\r\nand equal title to alliances, in the first rank of nations, where we\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nI recognized it as my duty not to sacrifice the honor and dignity of\r\nGermany. The question resolved itself into deciding whether there was\r\nany way to give myself up which might benefit the German nation and not\r\nsubject it to the above-mentioned disadvantages. Were there such a way\r\nI should have been ready without hesitation to add another sacrifice to\r\nthose already made.\r\n\r\nThe question of my giving myself up has also been debated--as I\r\nknow--in well-meaning and earnest German circles. Wherever this was\r\ndue to psychological depression or failure to realize the impression\r\nwhich self-chastisement, self-debasement, and fruitless martyrdom in\r\nthe face of the Entente must arouse, all that was needed was to recall\r\nthe materially political origin of the Entente's demand, cursorily\r\nmentioned above, in order to arrive at a clean-cut decision--in other\r\nwords, at an emphatic refusal.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise with the considerations based upon the assumption that\r\nI might, by taking upon myself, before the eyes of the whole world, the\r\nresponsibility for all important decisions and acts of my Government\r\nconnected with the war, contribute toward making the fate of the German\r\nnation easier. Here was not an act of unpolitical sentimentality, but,\r\non the contrary, a deed which, in my eyes, had much to commend it.\r\nThe thought that, according to the Constitution of the Empire then in\r\nforce, not I, but the Chancellor alone as was well known--bore the\r\nresponsibility, would naturally not have bothered me with regard to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nHad there been even the slightest prospect of bettering Germany's\r\nsituation by taking such a step, there would have been no possible\r\ndoubt for me personally as to what I should do. Already I had shown my\r\npersonal willingness to sacrifice myself when I left the country and\r\ngave up the throne of my fathers, because I had been erroneously and\r\ndeceivingly assured that I could, by so doing, make possible better\r\npeace terms for my people and prevent civil war. I should likewise have\r\nmade this further attempt to help my people, despite the fact that, in\r\nthe meantime, one of the considerations in favor of it which have been\r\nurged upon me--_viz._, the prevention of civil war--had already turned\r\nout to be false.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECALLS PLIGHT OF VERCINGETORIX\r\n\r\nThere was, however, no possibility of helping the German people by such\r\nan act. Surrender of my person would have had no result beyond our\r\nobedience to the demand from the Entente that I be given up. For no\r\ntribunal in the world can pronounce a just sentence before the state\r\narchives of _all_ the nations participating in the war are thrown open,\r\nas has been done, and is still being done, by Germany.\r\n\r\nWho, after the unprecedented judgment of Versailles, could still summon\r\nup optimism enough to believe that the Entente nations would place\r\ntheir secret documents at the disposal of such a tribunal? Therefore,\r\nafter careful reflection on my part, I gave the decisive importance\r\nthat was their due to the above-mentioned weighty considerations of\r\npersonal and national dignity and honor, and rejected the idea of\r\ngiving myself up. It was not for me to play the rôle of Vercingetorix,\r\nwho, as is well known, relying upon the magnanimity of his foes,\r\nsurrendered himself to them in order to obtain a better fate for his\r\npeople. In view of the conduct of our enemies during the war and in the\r\npeace negotiations, it was surely not to be assumed that the Entente\r\nwould show any greater magnanimity than did Cæsar when he threw the\r\nnoble Gaul into chains, subsequently had him executed, and, in spite of\r\nwhat Vercingetorix had done, enslaved his people just the same.\r\n\r\nI wish to remark in a general way that it has always proved wrong to\r\nfollow the suggestions of the enemy or to heed them to any extent. The\r\nwell-meant suggestions regarding my giving myself up, emanating from\r\nGermans, also grew from the soil of the enemy demands, though perhaps\r\npartly unknown to those making them. For that very reason it was\r\nnecessary to refuse to heed them.\r\n\r\nThus the only solution remaining is an international, nonpartisan\r\ncourt, which, instead of trying individuals, shall examine and\r\npronounce judgment upon all the happenings leading to the World War,\r\nin all the countries taking part therein, after all the national\r\narchives, not merely those of Germany, have been opened up. Germany can\r\nwell agree to this mode of procedure. Whosoever opposes it pronounces\r\njudgment upon himself!\r\n\r\nMy standpoint on the subject here discussed is expressed in the letter\r\nreproduced below, which I addressed, under date of April 5, 1921, to\r\nField Marshal von Hindenburg, and which the latter has made public in\r\nthe meantime. To make matters clearer, the letter which preceded it,\r\nfrom the Marshal, is also given.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDENBURG'S LETTER\r\n\r\n                                            HANOVER, _March 30, 1921_.\r\n\r\n    YOUR IMPERIAL AND ROYAL MAJESTY:\r\n\r\n    I beg to thank Your Majesty most respectfully for his gracious\r\n    interest in the illness of my wife. She is not yet out of danger.\r\n\r\n    I have little that is pleasant to report from our country. The\r\n    troubles in Central Germany are more serious than they are\r\n    represented to be by the Prussian Government. I hope that they will\r\n    soon be suppressed.\r\n\r\n    The effects of the Versailles peace decree lie ever more crushingly\r\n    upon the German people, and the object of this peace--the policy of\r\n    annihilation of our enemies--comes more plainly to the fore every\r\n    day. For the purpose of justifying this policy of force the fairy\r\n    tale of German war guilt must be adhered to.\r\n\r\n    The spokesman of the enemy alliance, Mr. Lloyd George, is little\r\n    disturbed by the fact that, on December 20th of last year, he\r\n    declared that no statesman wished war in the summer of 1914, that\r\n    all the nations had slipped or stumbled into it. In his speech at\r\n    the London conference on March 3d he calmly remarked that Germany's\r\n    responsibility for the war was fundamental, that it was the basis\r\n    on which the Peace of Versailles was erected, and that, if the\r\n    admission of this guilt should be refused or given up, the treaty\r\n    would become untenable.\r\n\r\n    Now as before, the question of war guilt is the cardinal point\r\n    in the future of the German nation. The admission of our alleged\r\n    \"guilt\" regarding the war, forced from the German representatives\r\n    at Versailles against their judgment, is wreaking frightful\r\n    vengeance; equally so the untrue acknowledgment of Germany's\r\n    \"complicity\" which Minister Simons gave at the London conference.\r\n\r\n    I agree with Your Majesty to the uttermost depths of my soul--in my\r\n    long term of military service I have had the good fortune and honor\r\n    to enter into close personal relations with Your Majesty. I know\r\n    that all the efforts of Your Majesty throughout your reign were\r\n    bent toward maintaining peace. I can realize how immeasurably hard\r\n    it is for Your Majesty to be eliminated from positive co-operation\r\n    for the fatherland.\r\n\r\n    The _Comparative Historical Tables_ compiled by Your Majesty, a\r\n    printed copy of which Your Majesty sent me recently, are a good\r\n    contribution to the history of the origin of the war and are\r\n    calculated to remove many an incorrect conception. I have regretted\r\n    that Your Majesty did not make the tables public, but limited\r\n    them instead to a small circle. Now that the tables, owing to\r\n    indiscretions, have been published in the foreign press, partly in\r\n    the form of incomplete excerpts, it seems to me advisable to have\r\n    them published in full in the German press.\r\n\r\n    To my great joy I have heard that there has been an improvement\r\n    recently in the health of Her Majesty. May God help further!\r\n\r\n    With the deepest respect, unlimited fidelity and gratitude, I am\r\n    Your Imperial and Royal Majesty's most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                              (Signed) VON HINDENBURG,\r\n                                            Field Marshal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KAISER'S LETTER\r\n\r\n                                         HOUSE DOORN, _April 5, 1921_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FIELD MARSHAL:\r\n\r\n    Accept my warmest thanks for your letter of March 30th, ult. You\r\n    are right. The hardest thing of all for me is to be obliged to\r\n    live in foreign parts, to follow, with burning anguish in my soul,\r\n    the awful fate of our dear fatherland, to which I have devoted the\r\n    labors of my entire life, and to be barred from co-operation.\r\n\r\n    You stood beside me during the dark, fatal days of November, 1918.\r\n    As you know, I forced myself to the difficult, terrible decision to\r\n    leave the country only upon the urgent declaration of yourself and\r\n    the rest of my counselors who had been summoned that only by my so\r\n    doing would it be possible to obtain more favorable armistice terms\r\n    for our people and spare it a bloody civil war.\r\n\r\n    The sacrifice was in vain. Now, as well as before, the enemy wishes\r\n    to make the German people expiate the alleged guilt of \"Imperial\r\n    Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSILENT UNDER ATTACKS\r\n\r\n    In my endeavor to subordinate all personal considerations to the\r\n    welfare of Germany, I keep myself completely in the background. I\r\n    am silent in the face of all the lies and slanders which are spread\r\n    abroad concerning me. I consider it beneath my dignity to defend\r\n    myself against attacks and abuse.\r\n\r\n    In accordance with this policy of restraint I have also kept the\r\n    _Historical Tables_ mentioned by you strictly objective and made\r\n    them accessible only to a narrow circle of acquaintances. I am\r\n    utterly at a loss to understand how they have now become public\r\n    through some sort of indiscretion or theft (?). The purpose\r\n    inspiring me when I prepared the historical tables was this:\r\n    To bring together strictly historical material by a systematic\r\n    enumeration of sober facts, such as might enable the reader to form\r\n    his own judgment of the historical happenings preceding the war. I\r\n    found my most convincing sources, be it remarked, in the literature\r\n    which has sprung up after the war, particularly in the works of\r\n    natives of the enemy countries. Therefore I am glad that you find\r\n    my modest contribution to history useful.\r\n\r\n    As to your suggestion to make the tables, which have been completed\r\n    in the meantime, accessible to the German press, I thank you, and\r\n    will follow it.[11]\r\n\r\n    Truth will hew a way for itself--mightily, irresistibly, like an\r\n    avalanche. Whoever does not close his ears to it against his better\r\n    judgment must admit that, during my twenty-six-year reign previous\r\n    to the war, Germany's foreign policy was directed solely to the\r\n    maintenance of peace. Its one and only aim was to protect our\r\n    sacred native soil, threatened from the west and the east, and the\r\n    peaceful development of our commerce and political economy.\r\n\r\n    Had we ever had warlike intentions we should have struck the blow\r\n    in 1900, when England's hands were tied by the Boer War, Russia's\r\n    by the Japanese War, at which time almost certain victory beckoned\r\n    us. In any event, we assuredly would not have singled out the year\r\n    1914, when we were confronted by a compact, overwhelmingly superior\r\n    foe. Also, every impartial man must acknowledge to himself that\r\n    Germany could expect nothing from the war, whereas our enemies\r\n    hoped to obtain from it the complete realization of the aims which\r\n    they had based, long since, upon our annihilation.\r\n\r\n    The fact that my zealous efforts and those of my Government\r\n    were concentrated, during the critical July and August days of\r\n    1914, upon maintaining world peace is being proved more and\r\n    more conclusively by the most recent literary and documentary\r\n    publications in Germany, and, most especially, in the enemy\r\n    countries. The most effective proof thereof is Sazonoff's\r\n    statement: \"The German Emperor's love of peace is a guarantee to\r\n    us that we ourselves can decide upon the moment of war.\" What\r\n    further proof of our innocence is needed? The above means that the\r\n    intention existed to make an attack upon one who was absolutely\r\n    unsuspecting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLS ACCUSATION FUTILE\r\n\r\n    God is my witness that I, in order to avoid war, went to the\r\n    uttermost limit compatible with responsibility for the security and\r\n    inviolability of my dear fatherland.\r\n\r\n    It is futile to accuse Germany of war guilt. To-day there is no\r\n    longer any doubt that not Germany, but the alliance of her foes,\r\n    prepared the war according to a definite plan, and intentionally\r\n    caused it.\r\n\r\n    For the purpose of concealing this, the allied enemies extorted\r\n    the false \"admission of guilt\" from Germany in the shameful\r\n    Peace Treaty and demanded that I _be produced before a hostile\r\n    tribunal_. You, my dear Field Marshal, know me too well not to be\r\n    aware that no sacrifice for my beloved fatherland is too great for\r\n    me. Nevertheless, a _tribunal in which the enemy alliance would\r\n    be at once plaintiff and judge would be not an organ of justice,\r\n    but an instrument of political arbitrariness, and would serve\r\n    only, through the sentence which would inevitably be passed upon\r\n    me, to justify subsequently the unprecedented peace conditions\r\n    imposed upon us_. Therefore, the enemy's demand naturally had to be\r\n    rejected by me.\r\n\r\n    But, in addition, the idea of _my being produced before a neutral\r\n    tribunal_, no matter how constituted, cannot be entertained by me.\r\n    _I do not recognize the validity of any sentence pronounced by any\r\n    mortal judge whatsoever, be he never so exalted in rank, upon the\r\n    measures taken by me most conscientiously as Emperor and King--in\r\n    other words, as the constitutional, not responsible, representative\r\n    of the German nation_--since, were I to do so, I should thereby be\r\n    sacrificing the honor and dignity of the German nation represented\r\n    by me.\r\n\r\n    _Legal proceedings having to do with guilt and punishment_,\r\n    instituted solely _against the head_ of one of the nations which\r\n    took part in the war, _deprive that one nation of every vestige\r\n    of equality of rights with the other nations_, and thereby of\r\n    its prestige in the community of nations. Moreover, this would\r\n    cause, as a consequence, _the impression desired by the enemy that\r\n    the entire \"question of guilt\" concerns only this one head of a\r\n    nation and the one nation represented by him_. It must be taken\r\n    into consideration, moreover, that _a nonpartisan judgment of the\r\n    \"question of guilt\" is impossible_, if the _legal proceedings\r\n    are not made to include the heads and leading statesmen of the\r\n    enemy powers_, and if their conduct is not subjected to the same\r\n    investigation, since it goes without saying that the conduct of\r\n    the aforesaid one nation at the outbreak of the war can be judged\r\n    correctly only if there is simultaneous consideration of the\r\n    actions of its opponents.\r\n\r\n    _A real clearing up of the \"question of guilt,\"_ in which surely\r\n    Germany would have no less interest than her foes, could be\r\n    accomplished only if _an international, nonpartisan tribunal,\r\n    instead of trying individuals as criminals, should establish all\r\n    the events which led to the World War_, as well as all other\r\n    offenses against international law, in order thereafter to measure\r\n    correctly the guilt of individuals implicated in every one of the\r\n    nations participating in the war.\r\n\r\n    Such an honest suggestion was officially made in Germany after\r\n    the end of the war, but, so far as I know, it was partly refused,\r\n    partly found unworthy of any answer at all. Furthermore, Germany,\r\n    immediately after the war, unreservedly threw open her archives,\r\n    whereas the enemy alliance has taken good care so far not to follow\r\n    such an example. The secret documents from the Russian archives,\r\n    now being made public in America, are but the beginning.\r\n\r\n    This method of procedure on the part of the enemy alliance in\r\n    itself, combined with overwhelming damaging evidence coming to\r\n    hand, shows where the \"war guilt\" is really to be sought! This\r\n    makes it all the more a solemn duty for Germany to collect, sift,\r\n    and make public, by every possible means, every bit of material\r\n    bearing on the \"question of guilt,\" in order, by so doing, to\r\n    unmask the real originators of the war.\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately, the condition of Her Majesty has become worse. My\r\n    heart is filled with the most grievous worry.\r\n\r\n    God with us!\r\n\r\n                         Your grateful\r\n                                     (Signed) WILHELM.\r\n\r\n  [10] This letter and the letter from the Field Marshal which preceded\r\n       it are reprinted herewith. The parts which are most important in\r\n       relation to the matter in question are underscored in the text.\r\n\r\n  [11] This has meanwhile been done. The _Comparative Historical Tables\r\n       from 1878 to the Outbreak of the War in 1914_ were published in\r\n       December, 1921, by K. F. Koehler, Leipsic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe Question of Guilt\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory can show nothing to compare with the World War of 1914-18. It\r\nalso can show nothing like the perplexity which has arisen as to the\r\ncauses leading up to the World War.\r\n\r\nThis is all the more astounding in that the Great War befell a highly\r\ncultivated, enlightened, politically trained race of men, and the\r\ncauses leading up to it were plainly to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe apparent complicity in the crisis of July, 1914, should deceive\r\nnobody. The telegrams exchanged at that time between the Cabinets of\r\nthe great powers and their rulers, the activities of the statesmen\r\nand leading private individuals in verbal negotiations with important\r\npersonages of the Entente, were certainly of the greatest importance\r\non account of the decisive significance assumed by almost every word\r\nwhen it came from responsible lips, by every line that was written or\r\ntelegraphed. The essential basis of the causes of the war, however, is\r\nnot altered by such things; it is firmly established, and people must\r\nnever hesitate from freeing it, calmly and with an eye to realities,\r\nfrom the bewildering outcroppings from the events accompanying the\r\noutbreak of war.\r\n\r\nThe general situation of the German Empire in the period before the\r\nwar had become continually more brilliant, and for that very reason\r\ncontinually more difficult from the point of view of foreign politics.\r\nUnprecedented progress in industry, commerce, and world traffic had\r\nmade Germany prosperous. The curve of our development tended steadily\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nThe concomitant of this peaceful penetration of a considerable part of\r\nthe world's markets, to which German diligence and our achievements\r\njustly entitled us, was bound to be disagreeable to older nations of\r\nthe world, particularly to England. This is quite a natural phenomenon,\r\nhaving nothing remarkable about it. Nobody is pleased when a competitor\r\nsuddenly appears and obliges one to look on while the old customers\r\ndesert to him. For this reason I cannot reproach the British Empire\r\nbecause of English ill humor at Germany's progress in the world's\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nHad England been able, by introducing better commercial methods, to\r\novercome or restrict German competition, she would have been quite\r\nwithin her rights in doing so and no objections could have been made.\r\nIt simply would have been a case of the better man winning. In the life\r\nof nations nobody can find it objectionable if two nations contend\r\nagainst each other peacefully by the same methods--_i. e._, peaceful\r\nmethods--yet with all their energy, daring, and organizing ability,\r\neach striving to benefit itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is quite another matter if one of these nations\r\nsees its assets on the world's balance sheet threatened by the\r\nindustry, achievements, and super business methods of the other,\r\nand hence, not being able to apply ability like that of its young\r\ncompetitor, resorts to force--_i. e._, to methods that are not those of\r\npeace, but of war--in order to call a halt upon the other nation in its\r\npeaceful campaign of competition, or to annihilate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY MERELY PROTECTIVE\r\n\r\nOur situation became more serious since we were obliged to build a\r\nnavy for the protection of our welfare, which, in the last analysis,\r\nwas not based on the nineteen billions yearly to which German exports\r\nand imports amounted. The supposition that we built this navy for the\r\npurpose of attacking and destroying the far stronger English fleet is\r\nabsurd, since it would have been impossible for us to win a victory on\r\nthe water, because of the discrepancy between the two navies. Moreover,\r\nwe were striding forward in the world market in accordance with our\r\ndesires and had no cause for complaint. Why, then, should we wish to\r\njeopardize the results of our peaceful labors?\r\n\r\nIn France the idea of revenge had been sedulously cultivated ever since\r\n1870-71; it was fostered, with every possible variation, in literary,\r\npolitical, and military writings, in the officer corps, in schools,\r\nassociations, political circles.\r\n\r\nI can well understand this spirit. Looked at from the healthy national\r\nstandpoint, it is, after all, more honorable for a nation to desire\r\nrevenge for a blow received than to endure it without complaint.\r\n\r\nBut Alsace-Lorraine had been German soil for many centuries; it was\r\nstolen by France and taken back by us in 1871 as our property. Hence, a\r\nwar of revenge which had as its aim the conquest of thoroughly German\r\nterritory was unjust and immoral. For us to have yielded on this point\r\nwould have been a slap in the face to our sentiments of nationality and\r\njustice. Since Germany could never voluntarily return Alsace-Lorraine\r\nto France, the French dream could be realized only by means of a\r\nvictorious war which should push forward the French boundary posts to\r\nthe left bank of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nGermany, on the contrary, had no reason for staking what she had won\r\nin 1870-71, so the course for her to pursue was to maintain peace with\r\nFrance, all the more so because of the fact that the combination of\r\nthe powers against the German-Austrian Dual Alliance was continually\r\nbecoming more apparent.\r\n\r\nAs to Russia, the mighty empire of the Tsars was clamoring for an\r\noutlet on the sea to the southward. This was a natural ambition and\r\nnot to be harshly judged. In addition, there was the Russian-Austrian\r\nconflict of influence, especially in Serbia, which also concerned\r\nGermany in so far as Germany and Austria-Hungary were allies.\r\n\r\nThe Russia of the Tsars, moreover, was in a state of continual internal\r\nferment and every Tsaristic Government had to keep the possibility for\r\na foreign conflict ever in readiness, in order always to be able to\r\ndeflect attention from inner troubles to foreign difficulties; to have\r\na safety valve as an outlet for the passions that might lead to trouble\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nAnother point was that Russia's enormous demand for loans was met\r\nalmost exclusively by France; more than twenty billions of French\r\ngold francs found their way to Russia, and France had a voice, to\r\nsome extent, in determining how they should be expended. As a result,\r\nit became entirely a matter of expenditure on strategic measures and\r\npreparations for war. The golden chain of the French billions not only\r\nbound Russia to France financially, but made Russia serve the French\r\nidea of revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPOSE OF \"ENCIRCLEMENT\"\r\n\r\nThus England, France, and Russia had, though for different reasons,\r\nan aim in common--_viz._, to overthrow Germany. England wished to do\r\nso for commercial-political reasons, France on account of her policy\r\nof revenge, Russia because she was a satellite of France and also\r\nfor reasons of internal politics and because she wished to reach the\r\nsouthern sea. These three great nations, therefore, were bound to act\r\ntogether. The union of these ambitions in a common course of action,\r\nduly planned, is what we call the \"policy of encirclement.\"\r\n\r\nAdded to all this there was also the Gentlemen's Agreement which has\r\nonly recently come to light and has already been thoroughly discussed\r\nin the \"Hohenlohe\" chapter; concerning this agreement I knew absolutely\r\nnothing during my reign, and the German Foreign Office was only\r\nsuperficially and unreliably informed.\r\n\r\nWhen I learned of it, I immediately sought information about it from\r\nHerr von Bethmann. He wrote me a rather puzzling letter to the effect\r\nthat there was surely something about it among the documents of the\r\nForeign Office; that the German ambassador at that time in Washington,\r\nvon Holleben, had made some confidential report on it, to be sure, but\r\nhad not given his source of information, wherefore the Foreign Office\r\nhad not attached any importance to the matter and had not reported\r\nfurther on it to me. Hence the said agreement had actually no influence\r\nupon Germany's policy, but it constitutes supplementary proof that the\r\nAnglo-Saxon world as far back as 1897 had combined against us, and\r\nthereby explains a number of obstacles encountered by Germany in her\r\nforeign policy. It also explains America's attitude in the war.\r\n\r\nWe were quite well acquainted, on the other hand, with the Entente\r\nCordiale, its foundations and purposes, and it decisively influenced\r\nthe course of our policy.\r\n\r\nIn view of the grouping of England, France, and Russia--three very\r\nstrong powers--only one political course lay open to Germany, the\r\nthreat of deciding Germany's future by force of arms must be avoided\r\nuntil we had secured for ourselves such an economic, military, naval,\r\nand national-political position in the world as to make it seem\r\nadvisable to our opponents to refrain from risking a decision by arms\r\nand to yield us the share in the apportionment and management of the\r\nworld to which our ability entitled us. We neither desired nor were we\r\nentitled to jeopardize our hard-won welfare.\r\n\r\n_The aims of the Entente could be attained only through a war, those of\r\nGermany only without a war._ It is necessary to hold fast to this basic\r\nidea; it is of more decisive value than all accessory matters. Hence I\r\nshall not go into detail here, nor take up Belgian or other reports,\r\nnor the telegrams sent just before the outbreak of war. The thorough\r\ntreatment of these details lies in the domain of research.\r\n\r\nIn Germany our situation was correctly understood, and we acted\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUGHT ENGLAND'S FRIENDSHIP\r\n\r\nTaking up once more our relations with England, we did everything in\r\nour power to bring about a rapprochement; we consented to the demand\r\nfor limitation of naval construction, as I have shown in my report\r\nof Haldane's visit to Berlin. I went so far as to try to utilize my\r\nfamily connections. But in vain. The actions of King Edward VII\r\nare explained by the simple fact that he was an Englishman and was\r\ntrying to bring to realization the plans of his Government. Maybe the\r\npolitical ambitions of the King, who did not begin to reign until well\r\nalong in years, contributed to this.\r\n\r\nWe certainly did all that was possible to meet England halfway, but\r\nit was useless, because the German export figures showed an increase;\r\nnaturally we could not limit our world commerce in order to satisfy\r\nEngland. That would have been asking too much.\r\n\r\nAs regards our policy toward England, we have been much blamed for\r\nhaving refused the offer of an alliance made us by Chamberlain, the\r\nEnglish Colonial Minister, toward the close of the 'nineties. This\r\nmatter, however, was far different in character, on closer inspection,\r\nfrom what it was represented as being.\r\n\r\nFirst, Chamberlain brought a letter with him from the English Premier,\r\nSalisbury, to Bülow, in which the English Prime Minister declared that\r\nChamberlain was dealing on his own account only, that the English\r\nCabinet was not behind him. This, to be sure, might have meant the\r\nadoption of a course that was diplomatically permissible, giving the\r\nEnglish Cabinet, which was responsible to Parliament, a free hand; but\r\nit turned out later, be it remarked, that the Liberal group in England\r\nwas at that time hostile to a German-English alliance.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in view of the fact that there was a possibility that the\r\ncourse adopted was a mere diplomatic formality--that Chamberlain might\r\nhave been sent on ahead and complete freedom of action retained for the\r\nEnglish Cabinet, which is a favorite method in London--Prince Bülow,\r\nwith my consent, went thoroughly into the matter with Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nIt transpired then that the English-German alliance was aimed\r\nunquestionably against Russia. Chamberlain spoke directly about a\r\nwar to be waged later by England and Germany against Russia. Prince\r\nBülow, in full agreement with me, declined politely but emphatically\r\nthus to disturb the peace of Europe. In so doing he was but following\r\nthe example of the great Chancellor, for Prince Bismarck coined the\r\nphrase--I myself have heard it repeatedly in the Bismarck family\r\ncircle: \"Germany must never become England's dagger on the European\r\ncontinent.\"\r\n\r\nSo we did nothing further at that time than to go straight ahead with\r\nour policy--_viz._, we refused all agreements which might lead to a war\r\nwhich was not based directly on the defense of our native soil. The\r\nrefusal of the Chamberlain offer is a proof of the German love of peace.\r\n\r\nAs to France, we sought to bring about an endurable state of affairs.\r\nThis was difficult, for, in French eyes, we were the archenemy and\r\nit was impossible for us to acquiesce in the demands inspired by the\r\npolicy of revenge. We settled the Morocco quarrel peacefully; no man of\r\nstanding in Germany entertained the idea of war on account of Morocco.\r\nFor the sake of peace we allowed France at that time to encroach\r\nupon the essentially legitimate interests of Germany in Morocco,\r\nstrengthened as the French were by the agreement concluded secretly\r\nwith England as to mutual compensation in Egypt and Morocco.\r\n\r\nIn the Algeciras Conference the outline of the Great War was already\r\nvisible. It is assuredly not pleasant to be forced to retreat\r\npolitically, as we did in the Morocco matter, but Germany's policy\r\nsubordinated everything to the great cause of preserving the peace of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nWe tried to attain this end by courtesy, which was partially resented.\r\nI recall the journey of my mother, the Empress Frederick, to Paris. We\r\nexpected a tolerably good reception, since she was an English Princess\r\nand went, as an artist, to be the guest of French art. Twice I visited\r\nthe Empress Eugénie--once from Aldershot at her castle of Fernborough,\r\nthe other time aboard her yacht, in Norwegian waters, near Bergen. This\r\nwas a piece of politeness that seemed to me perfectly natural, seeing\r\nthat I happened to be very near her. When the French General Bonnal was\r\nin Berlin with several officers, these gentlemen dined with the Second\r\nInfantry Regiment. I was present and toasted the French army--something\r\nthat was still out of the ordinary, but was done with the best\r\nintentions. I brought French female and male artists to Germany. All\r\nthis sort of thing, of course, was a trifle in the great game of\r\npolitics, but it at least showed our good will.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Russia, I went to the utmost trouble. My letters,\r\npublished in the meantime, were naturally never sent without the\r\nknowledge of the Imperial Chancellors, but always in agreement with\r\nthem and largely at their desire. Russia would doubtless never have\r\ngot into a war with Germany under Alexander III, for he was reliable.\r\nTsar Nicholas was weak and vacillating; whoever had last been with him\r\nwas right; and, naturally, it was impossible for me always to be that\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nI made every effort with this Tsar, also, to restore the traditional\r\nfriendship between Germany and Russia. I was moved to do so not only\r\nby political reasons, but by the promise which I had made to my\r\ngrandfather on his deathbed.\r\n\r\nI most urgently advised Tsar Nicholas, repeatedly, to introduce liberal\r\nreforms within his country, to summon the so-called Great Duma, which\r\nexisted and functioned even as far back as the reign of Ivan the\r\nTerrible. In doing so it was not my intention to interfere in Russian\r\ninternal affairs; what I wanted was to eliminate, in the interests of\r\nGermany, the ferment going on in Russia, which had often enough been\r\ndeflected before to foreign conflicts, as I have already described.\r\nI wished to help toward eliminating at least this one phase of the\r\ninternal situation in Russia, which threatened to cause war, and I was\r\nall the more willing to make the effort since I might thereby serve\r\nboth the Tsar and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Tsar paid no heed to my advice, but created a new Duma instead,\r\nwhich was quite inadequate for coping with the situation. Had he\r\nsummoned the old Duma he might have dealt and talked personally with\r\nall the representatives of his huge realm and won their confidence.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tsar resolved upon war against Japan, I told him that I would\r\nassure him security in the rear and cause him no annoyances. Germany\r\nkept this promise.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND DUKE'S VISIT\r\n\r\nWhen the course taken by the war did not fulfill the Tsar's\r\nexpectations, and the Russian and Japanese armies finally lay before\r\neach other for weeks without serious fighting, the young brother of the\r\nTsar, Grand Duke Michael, arrived at Berlin for a visit. We could not\r\nquite make out what he wanted. Prince Bülow, who was then Chancellor,\r\nrequested me to ask the Grand Duke sometime how matters really stood\r\nwith Russia; he said that he, the Prince, had received bad news and\r\nthought it was high time for Russia to bring the war to an end.\r\n\r\nI undertook this mission. The Grand Duke was visibly relieved when I\r\nspoke to him frankly; he declared that things looked bad for Russia. I\r\ntold him that it seemed to me that the Tsar ought to make peace soon,\r\nsince what the Grand Duke had told me about the unreliability of troops\r\nand officers appeared to me quite as serious as the renewed internal\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nGrand Duke Michael was grateful for my having given him an opportunity\r\nto talk. He said that the Tsar was vacillating, as always, but he must\r\nmake peace and would make it if I advised him to do so. He asked me to\r\nwrite a few lines to the Tsar to that effect, for him to deliver.\r\n\r\nI drafted a letter in English to Tsar Nicholas, went to Bülow, told him\r\nwhat the Grand Duke had told me, and showed him the draft of my letter.\r\nThe Prince thanked me and found the letter suitable. The Grand Duke\r\ninformed the Russian ambassador in Berlin, Count Osten-Sacken, and,\r\nafter he had repeatedly expressed his thanks, went direct to the Tsar,\r\nwho then had peace negotiations begun.\r\n\r\nCount Osten-Sacken told me, when next we met, that I had done Russia\r\na great service. I was glad this was recognized, and felt justified\r\nin hoping, on account of this, that my conduct would contribute\r\ntoward bringing about friendly relations with Russia. In acting as I\r\ndid I also worked toward preventing the possible spread of a Russian\r\nrevolution, during the Russo-Japanese War, across the frontiers of\r\nGermany. Germany earned no thanks thereby; however, our conduct during\r\nthe Russo-Japanese War is another proof of our love of peace.\r\n\r\nThe same purpose underlay my suggestion which led to the Björkö\r\nagreement (July, 1905). It contemplated an alliance between Germany\r\nand Russia, which both the Allies as well as other nations should be\r\nat liberty to join. Ratification of this agreement failed through the\r\nopposition of the Russian Government (Isvolsky).\r\n\r\nIt remains to say a few words about America. Aside from the Gentlemen's\r\nAgreement already mentioned, which assured America's standing beside\r\nEngland and France in a World War, America did not belong to the\r\nEntente Cordiale created by King Edward VII at the behest of his\r\nGovernment, and, most important of all, America, in so far as it is\r\npossible at present to judge events, did not contribute toward bringing\r\non the World War. Perhaps the unfriendly answer given by President\r\nWilson to the German Government at the beginning of the war may have\r\nhad some connection with the Gentlemen's Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FACTORS IN DEFEAT\r\n\r\nBut there can be no doubt that America's entry into the war, and the\r\nenormous supplies of ammunition, and especially of war materials, which\r\npreceded her entry, seriously hurt the chance of the Central Powers to\r\nbring the war to a successful termination by force of arms.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to avoid all emotional criticism of America\r\nalso, since, in the great game of politics, real factors only can be\r\nconsidered. America was at liberty (despite the Gentlemen's Agreement)\r\nto remain neutral or to enter the war on the other side. One cannot\r\nreproach a nation for a decision as to war or peace made in accordance\r\nwith its sovereign rights so long as the decision is not in violation\r\nof definite agreements. Such is not the case here.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must be noted that John Kenneth Turner, in his already\r\nmentioned book, _Shall It Be Again?_ shows, on the basis of extensive\r\nproofs, that all Wilson's reasons for America's entry into the war\r\nwere fictitious, that it was far more a case of acting solely in the\r\ninterest of Wall Street high finance.\r\n\r\nThe great profit derived by America from the World War consists in\r\nthe fact that the United States was able to attract to itself nearly\r\nfifty per cent of all the gold in the world, so that now the dollar,\r\ninstead of the English pound, determines the world's exchange rate. But\r\nhere also no reproach is at all justified, since any other nation in\r\na position to do so would have rejoiced in attracting to itself this\r\nincrease of gold and of prestige in the world's money market. It was\r\ncertainly regrettable for us that America did not do this stroke of\r\nbusiness on the side of the Central Powers.\r\n\r\nBut just as Germany objects with perfect justification to having had\r\nher peaceful labors combated by the Entente, not with peaceful, but\r\nwith warlike means, so also she can and must enter constant protest--as\r\nshe is already trying to do by means of published material--against\r\nAmerica's violation of the right at the close of the World War.\r\n\r\nPersonally I do not believe that the American people would have\r\nconsented to this; American women particularly would not have\r\nparticipated in the denial of President Wilson's Fourteen Points, if\r\nthey could have been enlightened at that time as to the facts. America,\r\nmore than other countries, had been misled by English propaganda,\r\nand therefore allowed President Wilson, who had been provided with\r\nunprecedented powers, to act on his own initiative at Paris--in other\r\nwords, to be beaten down on his Fourteen Points. Just as Mr. Wilson\r\nomitted mention, later on, of the English blockade, against which he\r\nhad protested previously, so also he acted with regard to his Fourteen\r\nPoints.\r\n\r\nThe German Government had accepted Wilson's Fourteen Points, although\r\nthey were severe enough. The Allies likewise had accepted the Fourteen\r\nPoints, with the exception of those on reparations and the freedom of\r\nthe seas. Wilson had guaranteed the Fourteen Points.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTEEN POINTS ABANDONED\r\n\r\nI fail to find the most important of them in the Versailles instrument,\r\nbut only those expressing the Entente's policy of violence, and\r\neven part of these in a greatly falsified form. Relying on Wilson's\r\nguaranty, Germany evacuated the enemy territory occupied by her and\r\nsurrendered her weapons--in other words, made herself defenseless. In\r\nthis blind confidence and the abandonment of the Fourteen Points on the\r\none side, and in the outbreak of the German revolution on the other,\r\nlies the key to our present condition.\r\n\r\nAccording to Turner, the Fourteen Points, as far back as the drawing up\r\nof the armistice terms, were, to Wilson, no more than a means of making\r\nGermany lay down her arms; as soon as this end was achieved he dropped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAlready a very large part of the American people has arrayed itself\r\nagainst Mr. Wilson and is unwilling to be discredited along with him. I\r\nam not dreaming of spontaneous American help for Germany; all I count\r\nupon is the sober acknowledgment by the American people that it has to\r\nmake good the gigantic wrong done Germany by its former President. For\r\nthe atmosphere of a victory does not last forever, and later on, not\r\nonly in Germany, but elsewhere, people will remember the unreliability\r\nof the American President and look upon it as American unreliability.\r\n\r\nThat is not a good thing, however, for the American people. To have\r\nthe policy of a nation branded with the stigma of unreliability is not\r\nadvantageous. When judgment is passed hereafter on American policy,\r\npeople will forget that Mr. Wilson, unversed in the ways of the world,\r\nwas trapped by Lloyd George and Clemenceau.\r\n\r\nI have met--particularly at the Kiel regattas--many American men and\r\nwomen whose political judgment and caution would make it impossible for\r\nthem to approve such a flagrant breach of faith as was committed by\r\nMr. Wilson, because of its effect on America's political prestige. It\r\nis upon such considerations of national egotism, not upon any sort of\r\nsentimental considerations, that I base my hope that Germany's burden\r\nwill be lightened from across the ocean.\r\n\r\nBesides the injustice in the abandonment of the Fourteen Points, it\r\nmust also be remembered that Mr. Wilson was the first to demand of the\r\nGerman reigning dynasty that it withdraw, in doing which he hinted\r\nthat, were such action taken, the German people would be granted a\r\nbetter peace. Before the Government of Prince Max joined in the demand\r\nfor my abdication of the throne, which it based on the same grounds as\r\nMr. Wilson--that Germany would thereby get better terms--(prevention of\r\ncivil war was used as a second means of bringing pressure on me)--it\r\nwas in duty bound to get some sort of a binding guaranty from Mr.\r\nWilson. In any event, the statements made, which became continually\r\nmore urgent and pressing, contributed toward making me resolve to quit\r\nthe country, since I was constrained to believe that I could render my\r\ncountry a great service by so doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCEPTED \"SIGHT UNSEEN\"\r\n\r\nI subordinated my own interests and those of my dynasty, which\r\ncertainly were not unimportant, and forced myself, after the severest\r\ninward struggles, to acquiesce in the wish of the German authorities.\r\nLater it transpired that the German Government had obtained no real\r\nguaranties. But, in the tumultuous sequence of events during those\r\ndays, it was necessary for me to consider the unequivocal and definite\r\nannouncement of the Imperial Chancellor as authoritative. For this\r\nreason I did not investigate it.\r\n\r\nWhy the Entente demanded, through Mr. Wilson, that I should abdicate\r\nis now obvious. It felt perfectly sure that, following my being\r\ndispossessed of the throne, military and political instability would\r\nnecessarily ensue in Germany and enable it to force upon Germany not\r\neasier but harder terms. At that time the revolution had not yet\r\nappeared as an aid to the Entente.\r\n\r\nFor me to have remained on the throne would have seemed to the Entente\r\nmore advantageous to Germany than my abdication. I myself agree with\r\nthis view of the Entente, now that it has turned out that the Max of\r\nBaden Government had no substantial foundation for its declaration that\r\nmy abdication would bring better terms to my fatherland.\r\n\r\nI go even further and declare that the Entente would never have dared\r\nto offer such terms to an intact German Empire. It would not have dared\r\nto offer them to an imperial realm upon which the parliamentary system\r\nhad not yet been forced, with the help of German Utopians, at the very\r\nmoment of its final fight for existence; to a realm whose monarchical\r\nGovernment had not been deprived of the power to command its army and\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nIn view of all this, heavy guilt also lies on the shoulders of the\r\nAmerican ex-President as a result of his having demanded my abdication\r\nunder the pretense that it would bring Germany better terms. Here also\r\nwe certainly have a point of support for the powerful lever which is\r\ndestined to drag the Treaty of Versailles from where it lies behind\r\nlock and key. In Germany, however, Mr. Wilson should never be confused\r\nwith the American people.\r\n\r\nIn setting forth my political principles in what follows I am actuated\r\nsolely by a desire to contribute toward proving Germany's innocence of\r\nhaving brought on the World War.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset of my reign German policy was based upon compromise\r\nof the differences which it found existing between nations. In its\r\nentirety, therefore, my policy was eminently peaceful. This policy\r\nof peaceful compromise became apparent in internal politics, at the\r\nvery beginning of my reign, in the legislation desired by me for the\r\nprotection of the workers. The development of social legislation,\r\nwhich placed Germany at the head of civilized nations in the domain of\r\ngovernmental protection, was based on a like foundation.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea of a policy of compromise went so far within\r\nGermany that the strength of the army would have remained far less than\r\nuniversal compulsory military service and the size of the population\r\nmade possible. Here, as well as in the matter of naval construction,\r\nthe curtailments demanded by the Reichstag were put up with by the\r\nCrown and the Government. Already at that time the question of\r\nGermany's capabilities of defense was left to the decision of the\r\npeople's representatives. A nation that wished and prepared war would\r\nhave adopted quite different tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\nINADEQUATE PREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\nThe more apparent the Entente's \"policy of encirclement\" and attack\r\nbecame, the more the means of protecting our welfare should have been\r\nstrengthened for defensive reasons. This idea of natural and justified\r\nself-protection, by means of defensive measures against a possible\r\nhostile attack was carried out in a wretchedly inadequate manner.\r\n\r\nGermany's desire for peace, in fact, was unable to develop this\r\nprotection by land and sea in a manner compatible with her financial\r\nand national strength and with the risk which our welfare was bound\r\nto run in case of a war. Therefore, we are now suffering not from the\r\nconsequences of the tendency toward aggression falsely imputed to us,\r\nbut actually from the consequences of a well-nigh incredible love of\r\npeace and of blind confidence.\r\n\r\nThe entirely different political principles of the Entente have already\r\nbeen described by me, also our continuous efforts to get upon friendly\r\nterms with the individual Entente nations.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to ignore completely the less important work done by\r\nGermany, also included within the framework of politics on a large\r\nscale, which was always inspired by the same purpose: to effect\r\ncompromise of existing points of conflict. The Kiel regatta brought us\r\nguests from all the leading nations. We sought compromise with the same\r\nzeal on the neutral territory of sport as in the domain of science by\r\nmeans of exchange professors, and foreign officers were most willingly\r\nallowed to inspect our army system. This latter might be adjudged a\r\nmistake, now that we can look back, but, in any event, all these points\r\nare certain proofs of our honest desire to live at peace with all.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Germany did not take advantage of a single one of the\r\nopportunities that arose for waging war with a sure prospect of success.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out the benevolent neutrality of Germany toward\r\nRussia at the time of the Russo-Japanese War.\r\n\r\nAt the time when England was deeply involved in the Boer War we might\r\nhave fought against England or against France, which, at that time,\r\nwould have been obliged to forego help from England. But we did not do\r\nso. Also, while the Russo-Japanese War was in progress, we might have\r\nfought not only against Russia, but also against France. But we did not\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Morocco crisis already touched upon, in connection\r\nwith which we set aside the idea of going to war, we also gave evidence\r\nof our desire for peace by overcoming the Bosnian crisis by diplomatic\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers these plainly visible political events as a whole\r\nand adduces the declarations of Entente statesmen such as Poincaré,\r\nClemenceau, Isvolsky, Tardieu, and others, one is bound to ask one's\r\nself, in amazement, how a peace treaty, founded upon Germany's guilt\r\nin having brought on the World War, could have been drafted and put\r\nthrough. This miscarriage of justice will not stand before the bar of\r\nworld history.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLAMES FRANCE FOR 1870\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, Louis Guetant, delegate from Lyon to the Society for the\r\nRights of Man, recently made this statement:\r\n\r\n\"If we once look upon events without prejudice, with complete\r\nindependence and frankness, without bothering about which camp chance\r\nplaced us in at birth, the following is forced upon our attention first\r\nof all: The War of 1914 is a consequence of the War of 1870. For, ever\r\nsince that earlier date, the idea of revenge, more or less veiled, has\r\nnever left us.\r\n\r\n\"The War of 1870, however, was prepared and declared by the French\r\nGovernment. The French Empire, indeed, needed it very badly in order to\r\ncontend against interior troubles and its steadily growing unpopularity\r\nwith the public. Even Gambetta, the wild tribune of the opposition,\r\nexclaimed: 'If the Empire brings us the left bank of the Rhine, I shall\r\nbecome reconciled with it!' Thus, it was a war of conquest; nobody\r\nbothered about what the conquered populations might have to say about\r\nit. 'We shall bend their will to ours!' Thus it is written in the law\r\nof the victor!\r\n\r\n\"And now, suddenly, the opportunity for doing this was to escape\r\nFrance. In view of the political difficulties and dangers of war caused\r\nby his candidacy, Prince Leopold declared himself ready to withdraw.\r\nThat is bad! Without a pretext there can be no war!\r\n\r\n\"It was the same with France as with the milkmaid and the broken\r\npitcher in the fable, only instead of, 'Farewell, calf, cow, pig,\r\nhens,' it was, 'Farewell, bloody profits, glory, victory, left bank\r\nof the Rhine, even Belgium!'--for the latter, too, lay on that left\r\nbank of the Rhine which France coveted. No, that would have been too\r\nhard, the disillusionment would have been too great, the opportunity\r\nmust be created anew. The entire chauvinistic press, the entire clan\r\nof boasters, set to work and soon found a way. Gramont, Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, sent Ambassador Benedetti to visit Emperor William,\r\nwho was taking the cure at Ems, and demand from him a written\r\npromise that, in case Prince Leopold should change his mind about\r\nhis withdrawal, he, William, as head of the family, would take issue\r\nagainst this.\r\n\r\n\"The withdrawal of Prince Leopold was announced to France in a valid\r\nmanner and officially accepted by the Spanish Government. There could\r\nbe no doubt as to its genuineness. Nevertheless the Paris newspapers,\r\nalmost without exception, clamored for war. Whoever, like Robert\r\nMichell in the _Constitutionel_, expressed his pleasure at the\r\nprospects for peace and declared himself satisfied, was insulted on\r\nthe street. Gambetta shouted at him: 'You are satisfied! What a base\r\nexpression!' Copies of his newspapers were stolen from the news stands,\r\nthrown into the river, hurled in his face! Emilie de Girandin wrote to\r\nhim: 'The opportunity is unique, unhoped-for; if the Empire misses it\r\nthe Empire is lost!' Then it was that preparation for the War of 1914\r\nwas begun.\"\r\n\r\nVoices like this also, which are not unique either in France or\r\nEngland, must always be adduced as proof that the guilt is not ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MISTAKEN, BUT NOT GUILTY\"\r\n\r\nOur political and diplomatic operations in the course of decades were\r\nnot, it must be admitted, faultlessly conceived or executed. But where\r\nwe made mistakes they were caused invariably by the too great desire to\r\nmaintain world peace. Such _mistakes do not constitute guilt_.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned elsewhere, I even consider the Congress of Berlin a\r\nmistake, for it made our relations with Russia worse. The congress was\r\na victory for Disraeli, an Anglo-Austrian victory over Russia, which\r\nturned Russian anger upon Germany. Yet--think of all that has been done\r\nsince then to make up with Russia! I have partly enumerated these acts.\r\nAnd Bismarck's sole intention in bringing about the Congress of Berlin\r\nwas, as I have pointed out, the prevention of a great general war.\r\n\r\nChancellor von Bethmann Hollweg also, who had strict orders from me to\r\nmaintain peace if it was at all possible, made mistakes in 1914; as a\r\nstatesman he was not at all adequate to the world crisis. But the blame\r\nfor the war cannot be put upon us simply because our opponents profited\r\nby our mistakes. Bethmann Hollweg wished to avoid the war, like all\r\nof us--sufficient proof of this is to be found in the one fact alone\r\nthat he persisted, until the 4th of August, in his political inertia,\r\nnegotiating with England in the erroneous belief that he could keep\r\nEngland out of the Entente.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject I wish also to call attention to the delusion\r\nunder which Prince Lichnowsky, the German ambassador in London, was\r\nlaboring. Soon after he had become ambassador, King George came to the\r\nEmbassy to dinner. The King's example was followed automatically by the\r\nbest society people in London.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess were singled out for marked attentions and\r\nexceedingly well treated socially. From this the German ambassador\r\ndrew the conclusion that our relations with England had improved,\r\nuntil, shortly before the war, Sir Edward Grey coolly informed him\r\nthat he must draw no political conclusions from social favors and good\r\ntreatment accorded to him personally.\r\n\r\nNothing could give a better insight into the difference between the\r\nEnglish and German mentality than this. The German assumed social\r\nfriendliness to be the expression of political friendliness, since\r\nthe German is accustomed to express aversion and approval by means of\r\nsocial forms as well as otherwise. He is very outspoken about what he\r\nhas on his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARGES ENGLISH INSINCERITY\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, however, makes a distinction; in fact, he is rather\r\npleased if the man to whom he is speaking confuses form with substance,\r\nor, in other words, if he takes the form to be the expression of actual\r\nsentiments and political views. Judged from the English standpoint,\r\nthe above-mentioned words of Sir Edward Grey were a perfectly frank\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nThe much-discussed nonrenewal of the reinsurance treaty with Russia,\r\nalready touched upon by me, is not to be considered so decisive as\r\nto have influenced the question of whether there was to be war or\r\npeace. The reinsurance treaty, in my opinion, would not have prevented\r\nthe Russia of Nicholas II from taking the road to the Entente; under\r\nAlexander III it would have been superfluous.\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck's view that the Russian ambassador, Prince Shuvaloff,\r\nwould have renewed the reinsurance treaty with him but not with his\r\nsuccessor, is naturally the honest, subjective way of looking at the\r\nmatter--judged in the light of fact, however, it does not hold water,\r\nin view of what the two parties concerned had to consider at that\r\ntime. For instance, the Under Secretary of State of the Prince, Count\r\nBerchem, stated officially in a report to the Prince that the treaty\r\ncould not be renewed, which meant that it could not be renewed through\r\nShuvaloff, either.\r\n\r\nI thought that not the old treaty, but only a new and different kind\r\nof treaty, was possible, in the drawing up of which Austria must\r\nparticipate, as in the old Three-Emperor-Relationship.\r\n\r\nBut, as I said, treaties with Nicholas II would not have seemed\r\nabsolutely durable to me, particularly after the sentiment of the very\r\ninfluential Russian general public had also turned against Germany.\r\n\r\nOur acts were founded upon the clear perception that Germany could\r\nreach the important position in the world and obtain the influence in\r\nworld affairs necessary to her solely by maintaining world peace. This\r\nattitude was strengthened, moreover, by personal considerations.\r\n\r\nNever have I had warlike ambitions. In my youth my father had given me\r\nterrible descriptions of the battlefields of 1870 and 1871, and I felt\r\nno inclination to bring such misery, on a colossally larger scale, upon\r\nthe German people and the whole of civilized mankind. Old Field Marshal\r\nMoltke, whom I respected greatly, had left behind him the prophetic\r\nwarning: Woe to him who hurls the firebrand of war upon Europe! And I\r\nconsidered as a political legacy from the great Chancellor the fact\r\nthat Prince Bismarck had said that Germany must never wage a preventive\r\nwar; that German resistance would be neutralized if she did.\r\n\r\nThus the trend of the German policy of maintaining the peace was\r\ndetermined by political insight, personal inclination, the legacies\r\nof two great men, Bismarck and Moltke, and the desire of the German\r\npeople to devote itself to peaceful labors and not to plunge into\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nWhatever has been said in malevolent circles about the existence of a\r\nGerman party favoring war is a conscious or unconscious untruth. In\r\nevery land there are elements which, in serious situations, either from\r\nhonest conviction or less lofty motives, favor the appeal to the sword,\r\nbut never have such elements influenced the course of German policy.\r\n\r\nThe accusations, especially those which have been made against the\r\nGeneral Staff to the effect that it worked for war, are pretty\r\nuntenable. The Prussian General Staff served its King and fatherland\r\nby hard, faithful work, and maintained Germany's ability to defend\r\nherself by labors extending over many years of peace, as was its duty,\r\nbut it exerted absolutely no political influence whatsoever. Interest\r\nin politics, as is well known, was never particularly strong in the\r\nPrussian-German army. Looking backward, one might almost say, in fact,\r\nthat it would have been better for us if those in leading military\r\ncircles had concerned themselves a bit more with foreign policy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, how the Peace of Versailles, in view of this perfectly\r\nclear state of affairs, could have been founded upon Germany's guilt\r\nin having caused the World War, would seem an insoluble riddle\r\nif it were not possible to trace the tremendous effect of a new\r\nwar weapon--_viz._, the political propaganda of England against\r\nGermany--planned on a large scale and applied with audacity and\r\nunscrupulousness. I cannot bring myself to dismiss this propaganda by\r\nbranding it with catchwords such as \"a piece of rascality,\" etc., since\r\nit constitutes an achievement which, in spite of its repugnant nature,\r\ncannot be ignored; it did us more harm than the arms in the hands of\r\nour opponents.\r\n\r\nTo us Germans, such an instrument of insincerity, distortion, and\r\nhypocrisy is not pleasing; it is something that is incompatible with\r\nthe German character; we try to convince our opponents with the weapon\r\nof truth as well as with other weapons. But war is a cruel thing\r\nand what matters in it is to win; after all, to fire heavy guns at\r\ncivilized beings is not a pleasant matter, nor to bombard beautiful old\r\ntowns, yet this had to be done by both sides in the war.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we could not have developed a propaganda on a large scale\r\nlike that of our enemies during the war for the very reason that they\r\nhad no foes in their rear, whereas we were surrounded. In addition,\r\nmost Germans have not the gift to fit a scheme of propaganda to the\r\ndifferent nationalities of the nations upon which it is supposed to\r\nwork. But, just as the English were more than our match with that\r\nterrible weapon of theirs, the tank, against which we could bring\r\nnothing of equal efficiency, so also were they superior to us with\r\ntheir very effective weapon of propaganda.\r\n\r\nAnd this weapon still continues its work and we are compelled still to\r\ndefend ourselves against it over and over again. For there can be no\r\ndoubt that the unjust Peace of Versailles could not have been founded\r\nupon Germany's war guilt unless propaganda had previously accomplished\r\nits task and, partly with the support of German pacifists, instilled\r\ninto the brains of 100,000,000 human beings the belief in Germany's\r\nguilt, so that the unjust Peace of Versailles seemed to many justified.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPES FOR VERSAILLES REACTION\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, things have changed, the barriers between nations have\r\nfallen, and gradually they are awakening to the realization of how\r\ntheir confidence was imposed upon. The reaction will be crushing to\r\nthe makers of the Versailles Peace, but helpful to Germany. It goes\r\nwithout saying that, among the statesmen, politicians, and publicists\r\nof the Entente who really know, not a single one is really convinced of\r\nGermany's guilt in having caused the World War. Every one of them knows\r\nthe real interrelation of events, and assuredly there never was a case\r\nwhere so many augurs smiled at each other over a secret held in common\r\nas the case of the responsibility for the World War. In fact, one may\r\neven speak of a chorus of such individuals, since twenty-eight nations\r\ntook part in the war against Germany. But, in the long run, not even\r\nthe shrewdest augurs will suffice to make world history. Truth will\r\nmake its way forward and thus Germany will come into her rights.\r\n\r\nThe various stipulations of the Versailles Treaty are in themselves\r\nnull and void, since they can be observed neither by the Entente nor\r\nby Germany. It has been possible for months to note what difficulties\r\nare arising in the path not only of Germany, but of the victors, as a\r\nresult of such an extravagant instrument.\r\n\r\nIn many ways the treaty has been punctured by the Entente itself, and\r\nfor this the reason is easily found. In the present highly developed\r\nstate of the world, which rests upon free, systematic exchange of\r\nmaterial and intellectual property, regulated solely by production\r\nitself, it is quite out of the question for three men--no matter how\r\neminent they may be--to sit themselves down anywhere and dictate\r\nparagraphed laws to the world. Yet that is what the Versailles Treaty\r\ndoes, not only for Germany, but also, indirectly, for the Entente and\r\nAmerica, since all economic questions can be solved by mutual, not\r\none-sided, action.\r\n\r\nThe life of nations is regulated always--and most particularly in our\r\nday--not by paragraphs, but simply and solely by the needs of nations.\r\nIt is possible, to be sure, to do violence to those national needs\r\ntemporarily by the imposition of arbitrary decisions, but, in such\r\ncases, both parties concerned must suffer.\r\n\r\nThe world is in such a stage just now. Conditions like those at present\r\ncannot last; not guns, nor tanks, nor squadrons of airplanes, can\r\nperpetuate them. Therefore, their removal has already begun; for, if\r\nthe peace of Versailles were really such a judicious, unimpeachable\r\ninstrument, bringing blessings upon the world, there would not be\r\nconstant need of new conferences, discussions, and meetings having\r\nto do with this \"marvelous\" document. The constant necessity for new\r\ninterpretations is due, indeed, to the fact that the needs of highly\r\ncultivated and civilized nations were not taken into account when the\r\npeace was concluded.\r\n\r\nOne must not be pharisaical, however; up to a certain point the\r\nextravagance of the terms imposed by the victor after a life-and-death\r\nstruggle is a natural consequence of the relief felt at having escaped\r\nalive from deadly danger.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I know that Germany, if we had emerged victorious from\r\nthe war, would have imposed quite different terms--_i. e._, terms that\r\nwould have been just and endurable. The peace treaties of Brest-Litovsk\r\nand Bucharest--which indeed are not at all comparable with the Treaty\r\nof Versailles--cannot be adduced against us. They were concluded in\r\nthe very midst of the war and had to include conditions which would\r\nguarantee our safety until the end of the war. Had it come to a general\r\npeace, the treaty made by us in the East would have had a far different\r\naspect; had we won the war, it would have been revised by ourselves. At\r\nthe time it was made it was necessary to give preference to military\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nBut enlightenment regarding the unjust Treaty of Versailles is on the\r\nway and the necessities of life among present-day nations will speak\r\nin imperious tones to victors and vanquished.\r\n\r\nAfter years of the heaviest trial will come the liberation from a yoke\r\nimposed unjustly upon a great, strong, honest nation. Then every one of\r\nus will be glad and proud again that he is a German.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe Revolution and Germany's Future\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not care what my foes say about me. I do not recognize them as\r\nmy judges. When I see how the same people who exaggeratedly spread\r\nincense before me in other days are now vilifying me, the most that I\r\ncan feel is pity. The bitter things that I hear about myself from home\r\ndisappoint me. God is my witness that I have always wished what was\r\nbest for my country and my people, and I believed that every German\r\nhad recognized and appreciated this. I have always tried to keep my\r\npolitical acts, everything that I did as a ruler and a man, in harmony\r\nwith God's commandments. Much turned out differently from what I\r\ndesired, but my conscience is clean. _The welfare of my people and my\r\nEmpire was the goal of my actions._\r\n\r\nI bear my personal fate with resignation, for the Lord knows what He\r\ndoes and what He wishes. He knows why He subjects me to this test. I\r\nshall bear everything with patience and await whatsoever God still\r\nholds in store for me.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that grieves me is the fate of my country and my\r\npeople. I am pained at the hard period of trial which my children of\r\nthe German land are undergoing, which I--obliged to live in foreign\r\nparts--cannot suffer with them. _That is the sword thrust which pierces\r\nthrough my soul_; that is what is bitter to me. Here in solitude I\r\nstill feel and think solely for the German people, still wonder how I\r\ncan better matters and help with enlightenment and counsel.\r\n\r\nNor can bitter criticism ever lessen my love for my land and people. I\r\nremain faithful to the Germans, no matter how each individual German\r\nmay now stand with regard to me. To those who stand by me in misfortune\r\nas they stood in prosperity, I am grateful--they comfort me and relieve\r\nmy gnawing homesickness for my beloved German home. And I can respect\r\nthose who, impelled by honest convictions, array themselves against me;\r\nas for the rest, let them look to justifying themselves to God, their\r\nconsciences, and history.\r\n\r\nThey will not succeed in separating me from the Germans. Always I\r\ncan look upon country and people solely as one whole. They remain to\r\nme what they were when I said on the occasion of the opening of the\r\nReichstag on the 1st of August, 1914, in the Imperial Palace: \"I know\r\nno more of parties; I know only Germans.\"\r\n\r\nThe revolution broke the Empress's heart. She aged visibly from\r\nNovember, 1918, onward, and could not resist her bodily ills with the\r\nstrength of before. Thus her decline soon began. The hardest of all\r\nfor her to bear was her homesickness for the soil of Germany, for\r\nthe German people. Notwithstanding this, she still tried to bring me\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nThe revolution destroyed things of enormous value. It was brought about\r\nat the very moment when the German nation's fight for existence was to\r\nhave been ended, and every effort should have been concentrated upon\r\nreconstruction. It was a crime against the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIND AND WHIRLWIND\r\n\r\nI am well aware that many who rally around the Social Democratic banner\r\ndid not wish revolution; some of the individual Social Democratic\r\nleaders likewise did not wish it at that time, and more than one among\r\nthem was ready to co-operate with me. Yet these Social Democrats\r\nwere incapable of preventing the revolution, and therein lies their\r\nshare of guilt for what is now going on, all the more so since the\r\nSocialist leaders stood closer to the revolutionary masses than the\r\nrepresentatives of the monarchical Government and, therefore, could\r\nexert more influence upon them.\r\n\r\nBut the leaders, even in the days before the war, had brought the idea\r\nof revolution to the masses and fostered it, and the Social Democracy\r\nhad been, from time immemorial, openly hostile to the earlier,\r\nmonarchical form of government, and had worked systematically toward\r\neliminating it. It sowed the wind and reaped the whirlwind.\r\n\r\nThe time and nature of the revolution were not to the liking of a\r\nnumber of the leaders, but it was exactly these men who, at the\r\ndecisive moment, abandoned leadership to the most unbridled elements\r\nand failed to bring their influence to bear toward maintaining the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the Government of Prince Max to protect the old form\r\nof government. It failed to fulfill its holy duty because it had become\r\ndependent on the Socialist leaders, the very men who had lost their\r\ninfluence on the masses to the radical elements.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the greatest share of the guilt falls upon the leaders, and\r\nfor that reason history will not brand the German working classes, but\r\ntheir leaders, with the curse of the revolution, in so far as these\r\nleaders participated in making the revolution or failed to prevent it\r\nand it will also brand the Government of Prince Max of Baden with that\r\ncurse.\r\n\r\nThe German workers fought brilliantly in battle under my leadership,\r\nand at home, as well, labored ceaselessly to provide munitions and war\r\nmaterial. That is something which must not be forgotten. It was only\r\nlater that some of them began to break away, but the responsibility for\r\nthis lies at the door of the agitators and revolutionists, not at that\r\nof the decent, patriotic section of the working classes.\r\n\r\nThe conscienceless agitators are the men really responsible for\r\nGermany's total collapse. That will be recognized some day by the\r\nworking classes themselves.\r\n\r\nThe present is a hard time for Germany. Of the future of this healthy,\r\nstrong nation I do not despair. A nation which can achieve such an\r\nunprecedented rise as that of Germany between 1871 and 1914, a nation\r\nwhich can maintain itself successfully for over four years in a\r\ndefensive war against twenty-eight nations, cannot be driven from the\r\nearth. Economically, the world cannot do without us.\r\n\r\nBut in order that we may regain the position in the world which is\r\nGermany's due, we must not await or count upon help from outside. Such\r\nhelp will not come, in any event; were it to come, it would but mean\r\nat best our being mere Helots. Also, the help which the German Social\r\nDemocratic party hoped for from abroad has not materialized, after all.\r\nThe international part of the socialistic program has proved itself a\r\nfrightful mistake.\r\n\r\nThe workers of the Entente lands took the field against the German\r\npeople in order to destroy it; nowhere was there a trace of\r\ninternational solidarity among the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER GERMAN MISTAKE\r\n\r\nThis mistake, too, is one of the reasons why the war turned out so\r\nbadly for Germany. The English and French working classes were rightly\r\ndirected--_i. e._, nationalistically--by their leaders; the German\r\nworking classes were wrongly directed--_i. e._, internationally.\r\n\r\nThe German people must rely upon no other people, but solely upon\r\nthemselves. When self-conscious, national sentiment returns to all the\r\nStrata of our people our upward march will begin. All classes of the\r\npopulation must be united in national sentiment, no matter if their\r\nways lie apart in other departments of the nation's life. Therein lies\r\nthe strength of England, of France--even of the Poles.\r\n\r\nIf this comes to pass, the feeling of solidarity with all fellow\r\nmembers of the nation, the consciousness of the dignity of our noble\r\nland, the pride in being German, and the genuinely German conception of\r\nethics, which was one of the secret sources of strength that have made\r\nGermany so great, will come back to us.\r\n\r\nIn the community of cultured nations Germany will again play, as she\r\ndid before the war, the rôle of the nation with the greatest capacity\r\nfor labor, and will once more march victoriously in the van in peaceful\r\ncompetition, offering not only to herself, but to all the nations of\r\nthe earth, whatever is best in the domain of technical achievement, of\r\nscience, of art.\r\n\r\nI believe in the revocation of the unjust Peace of Versailles by the\r\njudgment of the sensible elements of foreign lands and by Germany\r\nherself. I believe in the German people and in the continuation of its\r\npeaceful mission in the world, which has been interrupted by a terrible\r\nwar, for which Germany, since she did not will it, does not bear the\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Abdication of Kaiser and Crown Prince, 280-288, 320, 321, 322.\r\n\r\n  Abdul-Hamid, Sultan, and the Albanians, 142, 164,
