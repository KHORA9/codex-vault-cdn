If I had, and\r\nhad recorded the answers, I could write a very large part\r\nof the political and literary history of the United States.\r\nI never kept a diary, except for a few and brief periods.\r\nSo for what I have to say, I must trust to my memory.  I have\r\nno doubt that after these volumes are published, there will\r\ncome up in my mind matter enough to make a dozen better ones.\r\n\r\nI invoke for this book that kindly judgment of my countrymen\r\nwhich has attended everything I have done in my life so far.\r\nI have tried to guard against the dangers and the besetting\r\ninfirmities of men who write their own biography.  An autobiography,\r\nas the word implies, will be egotistical.  An old man's autobiography\r\nis pretty certain to be garrulous.  If the writer set forth\r\ntherein his own ideals, he is likely to be judged by them,\r\neven when he may fall far short of them.  Men are likely to\r\nthink that he claims or pretends to have lived up to them,\r\nhowever painfully conscious he may be that they are only dreams\r\nwhich even if he have done his best have had little reality\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nThere is another danger for a man who tells the story of\r\ngreat transactions, in which he has taken part, whether legislative,\r\nexecutive, military, or political, or any other, in which\r\nthe combined action of many persons was required for the result.\r\nHe is apt to claim, consciously or unconsciously, that he\r\nhimself brought the whole thing about.\r\n\r\n\"Papa,\" said the little boy to the veteran of the Civil War,\r\n\"Did anybody help you to put down the Rebellion?\"\r\n\r\nThis peril specially besets narrators in their old age.  I\r\nam afraid I can hardly escape it.\r\n\r\nI once heard General George H. Thomas relate to a brilliant\r\ncompany at a supper party, among whom were Chief Justice Chase,\r\nGeneral Eaton, Commissary General in two wars, Senator Trumbull,\r\nWilliam M. Evarts, Joseph Henry, John Sherman, his brother\r\nthe General, and several other gentlemen of equal distinction,\r\nthe story of the battles of Nashville and Franklin.  The story\r\nwas full of dramatic interest.  Yet no one who heard it would\r\nhave known that the speaker himself had taken part in the\r\ngreat achievement, until, just at the end, he said of the\r\nBattle of Nashville that he thought of sending a detachment\r\nto cut off Hood's army at a ford by which he escaped after\r\nthey were defeated, but he concluded that it was not safe\r\nto spare that force from immediate use in the battle.  \"If\r\nI had done it,\" he added, with great simplicity, \"I should\r\nhave captured his whole army.  There is where I made my mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThe recollections of the actors in important political transactions\r\nare doubtless of great historic value.  But I ought to say\r\nfrankly that my experience has taught me that the memory of\r\nmen, even of good and true men, as to matters in which they\r\nhave been personal actors, is frequently most dangerous and\r\nmisleading.  I could recount many curious stories which have\r\nbeen told me by friends who have been writers of history and\r\nbiography, of the contradictory statements they have received\r\nfrom the best men in regard to scenes in which they have been\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIf any critic think this book lacking in dignity, or wisdom,\r\nor modesty, it is hoped that it may, by way of offset, make\r\nup for it in sincerity.  I have so far lived in the world\r\nwithout secrets.  If my countrymen, or the people of Massachusetts,\r\nhave trusted me, they have fully known what they were doing.\r\n\"They had eyes and chose me.\"\r\n\r\nI have never lifted any finger or spoken a word to any man\r\nto secure or to promote my own election to any office.  I\r\ndo not mean to criticise other men who advance their honorable\r\nambition for public service or exert themselves to get office\r\nfor which they think themselves fit.  It was the \"high Roman\r\nfashion.\"  It has been the fashion in England always.  English\r\ngentlemen do not disdain a personal solicitation for political\r\nsupport, and think no harm in it, to which no American gentleman\r\nwould for a moment stoop.\r\n\r\nIt has been the custom in other parts of the country almost\r\nfrom the beginning of the Government.  But what I think a\r\nbetter custom has prevailed in Massachusetts.  I arrogate\r\nto myself no virtue in this respect.  I only say that it has\r\nbeen my supreme good fortune to be the son of a Commonwealth\r\namong whose noble and high-minded people a better and more\r\nfastidious habit has prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe lesson which I have learned in life, which is impressed\r\non me daily, and more deeply as I grow old, is the lesson\r\nof Good Will and Good Hope.  I believe that to-day is better\r\nthan yesterday, and that to-morrow will be better than to-\r\nday.  I believe that in spite of so many errors and wrongs\r\nand even crimes, my countrymen of all classes desire what\r\nis good, and not what is evil.  I repeat what I said to the\r\nState Convention of Massachusetts after the death of President\r\nMcKinley:\r\n\r\n\"When I first came to manhood and began to take part in public\r\naffairs, that greatest of crimes, human slavery, was entrenched\r\neverywhere in power in this Republic.  Congress and Supreme\r\nCourt, Commerce and Trade and Social Life alike submitted\r\nto its imperious and arrogant sway.  Mr. Webster declared\r\nthat there was no North, and that the South went clear up\r\nto the Canada line.  The hope of many wise and conservative\r\nand, as I now believe, patriotic men, of saving this country\r\nfrom being rent into fragments was in leaving to slavery forever\r\nthe great territory between the Mississippi and the Pacific,\r\nin the Fugitive Slave Law, a law under which freemen were\r\ntaken from the soil of Massachusetts to be delivered into\r\nperpetual bondage, and in the judgment of the Supreme Court\r\nwhich declared it as the lesson of our history that the Negro\r\nhad no rights that a white man was bound to respect.\r\n\r\n\"Last week at Dartmouth, at the great celebration in honor\r\nof Daniel Webster, that famous college gave the highest honor\r\nin its power to a Negro, amid the applause of the brilliant\r\nassembly.  And there was no applause more earnest or hearty\r\nthan that of the successor of Taney, the Democratic Chief\r\nJustice of the United States.  I know that the people of that\r\nrace are still the victims of outrages which all good men\r\ndeplore.  But I also believe that the rising sense of justice\r\nand of manhood in the South is already finding expression\r\nin indignant remonstrance from the lips of governors and preachers,\r\nand that the justice and manhood of the South will surely\r\nmake their way.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Fellow Citizens, amid the sorrow and the mourning and\r\nthe tears, amid the horror and the disappointment and the\r\nbaffled hope, there comes to us from the open grave of William\r\nMcKinley a voice of good omen!  What pride and love must we\r\nfeel for the republic that calls such men to her high places?\r\nWhat hope and confidence in the future of a people, where\r\nall men and all women of all parties and sections, of all\r\nfaiths and creeds, of all classes and conditions, are ready\r\nto respond as ours have responded to the emotion of a mighty\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"You and I are Republicans.  You and I are men of the North.\r\nMost of us are Protestants in religion.  We are men of native\r\nbirth.  Yet if every Republican were to-day to fall in his\r\nplace, as William McKinley has fallen, I believe our countrymen\r\nof the other party, in spite of what we deem their errors,\r\nwould take the Republic and bear on the flag to liberty and\r\nglory.  I believe if every Protestant were to be stricken\r\ndown by a lightning-stroke, that our brethren of the Catholic\r\nfaith would still carry on the Republic in the spirit of a\r\ntrue and liberal freedom.  I believe if every man of native\r\nbirth within our borders were to die this day, the men of\r\nforeign birth, who have come here to seek homes and liberty\r\nunder the shadow of the Republic, would carry it on in God's\r\nappointed way.  I believe if every man of the North were to\r\ndie, the new and chastened South, with the virtues it has\r\ncherished from the beginning, with its courage and its constancy,\r\nwould take the country and bear it on to the achievement of\r\nits lofty destiny.  The Anarchist must slay 75,000,000 Americans\r\nbefore he can slay the Republic.\r\n\r\n\"Of course there would be mistakes.  Of course there would\r\nbe disappointments and grievous errors.  Of course there would\r\nbe many things for which the lovers of liberty would mourn.\r\nBut America would survive them all, and the nation our fathers\r\nplanted would endure in perennial life.\r\n\r\n\"William McKinley has fallen in high place.  The spirit of\r\nAnarchy, always the servant of the spirit of Despotism, aimed\r\nits shaft at him, and his life for this world is over.  But\r\nthere comes from his fresh grave a voice of lofty triumph:\r\n'Be of good cheer.  It is God's way.'\"\r\n\r\nI account it my supreme good fortune that my public life\r\nhas been spent in the service of Massachusetts.  No man can\r\nknow better than I do how unworthy I have been of a place\r\nin the great line of public men who have adorned her history\r\nfor nearly three hundred years.  What a succession it has\r\nbeen.  What royal house, what empire or monarchy, can show\r\na catalogue like that of the men whom in every generation\r\nshe has called to high places--Bradford, and Winthrop, and\r\nSir Henry Vane, Leverett, and Sam Adams and John Adams and\r\nhis illustrious son, and Cabot and Dexter, Webster and Everett\r\nand Sumner and Andrew.  Nothing better can be said in praise\r\nof either than that they have been worthy of her, and she\r\nhas been worthy of them.  They have given her always brave\r\nand honest service, brave and honest counsel.  She has never\r\nasked of them obsequiousness, or flattery, or even obedience\r\nto her will, unless it had the approval of their own judgment\r\nand conscience.  That relation has been alike most honorable\r\nand most advantageous to both sides.  They have never been\r\nafraid to trust the people and they have never been afraid\r\nto withstand the people.  They knew well the great secret\r\nof all statesmanship, that he that withstands the people on\r\nfit occasions is commonly the man who trusts them most and\r\nalways in the end the man they trust most.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nROGER SHERMAN AND HIS FAMILY\r\n\r\nMy mother, who died in 1866, at the age of eighty-three,\r\nwas the daughter of Roger Sherman of Connecticut.  Her father\r\ndied when she was ten years old.  She lived in her mother's\r\nhouse, opposite the College in New Haven, until her marriage\r\nin 1812.  New Haven was one of the capital cities of New England.\r\nIts society had the special attraction which belonged to the\r\nseat of a famous college.  Her mother's house was visited\r\nby the survivors of the great period of the Revolution and\r\nthe framing of the Constitution, whom her father had known\r\nduring an eminent public service of nearly forty years.\r\n\r\nMy mother was the most perfect democrat, in the best sense\r\nof the word, that I ever knew.  It was a democracy which was\r\nthe logical result of the doctrines of the Old Testament and\r\nof the New.  It recognized the dignity of the individual soul,\r\nwithout regard to the accident of birth or wealth or power\r\nor color of the skin.  If she were in the company of a Queen,\r\nit would never have occurred to her that they did not meet\r\nas equals.  And if the Queen were a woman of sense, and knew\r\nher, it would never occur to the Queen.  The poorest people\r\nin the town, the paupers in the poorhouse, thought of her\r\nas a personal friend to whom they could turn for sympathy\r\nand help.  No long before her death, an old black woman died\r\nin the poorhouse.  She died in the night.  An old man who\r\nhad been a town pauper a good part of his life sat up with\r\nher and ministered to her wants as well as he could.  Just\r\nbefore she died, the old woman thanked him for his kindness.\r\nShe told him she should like to give him something to show\r\nher gratitude, but that she had nothing in the world; but\r\nshe thought that if he would go to Mrs. Hoar and ask her\r\nto give him a dollar, as a favor to her she would do it.  The\r\ndraft on the bank of kindness was duly honored.  And I think\r\nthe legacy was valued as highly by her who paid it as if it\r\nhad been a costly gem or a work of art from an emperor's gallery.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun was very intimate in my grandmother's household\r\nwhen he was in college, and always inquired with great interest\r\nafter the young ladies of the family when he met anybody who\r\nknew them.  He had a special liking for my mother, who was\r\nabout his own age, and always inquired for her.\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Evarts visited Washington in his youth and called\r\nupon Mr. Calhoun, who received him with great consideration,\r\nwent with him in person to see the President and what was\r\nworth seeing in Washington.  Mr. Calhoun spoke in the highest\r\nterms of Roger Sherman to Mr. Evarts, said that he regarded\r\nhim as one of the greatest of our statesmen, and that he had\r\nseen the true interests of the South when Southern statesmen\r\nwere blind to them.  This Mr. Calhoun afterward said in a\r\nspeech in the Senate, including, however, Mr. Paterson of\r\nNew Jersey and Oliver Ellsworth in his eulogy.\r\n\r\nThe story of Roger Sherman's life has never been told at length.\r\nThere is an excellent memoir of him in Sanderson's \"Lives\r\nof the Signers,\" written by Jeremiah Evarts, with the assistance\r\nof the late Governor and Senator Roger S. Baldwin of Connecticut.\r\nBut when that was written the correspondence of the great\r\nactors of his time, and indeed the journals of the Continental\r\nCongress and the Constitutional Convention and the Madison\r\nPapers, were none of them accessible to the public.\r\n\r\nAn excellent though brief memoir of Mr. Sherman was published\r\na few years ago by L. H. Boutell, Esq., of Chicago.  Mr. Sherman\r\nwas a man who seemed to care nothing for fame.  He was content\r\nto cause great things to be done for his country, and cared\r\nnothing for the pride and glory of having done them.  The\r\npersonal pronoun I is seldom found in any speech or writing\r\nof his.  He had a large share in the public events that led\r\nto the Revolution, in the conduct of the War, in the proceedings\r\nof the Continental Congress, in the framing of the Constitution,\r\nin securing its adoption by Connecticut, and in the action\r\nof the House and Senate in Washington's first Administration.\r\nHe was also for many years Judge of the highest court of his\r\nState.  He was a man of indefatigable industry.  An accomplished\r\nlady employed to make investigations in the public archives\r\nof the Department of State, reported that she did not see\r\nhow he could ever have gone to bed.\r\n\r\nHe had a most affectionate and tender heart.  He was very\r\nfond of his family and friends.  Although reserved and silent\r\nin ordinary company, he was very agreeable in conversation,\r\nand had a delightful wit.  Some of the very greatest men of\r\nhis time have left on record their estimate of his greatness.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson said of him:  \"There is old Roger Sherman,\r\nwho never said a foolish thing in his life.\"\r\n\r\nTheodore Sedgwick said:  \"He was a man of the selectest wisdom.\r\nHis influence was such that no measure, or part of a measure\r\nwhich he advocated, ever failed to pass.\"\r\n\r\nFisher Ames said that if he were absent through a debate\r\nand came in before the vote was taken he always voted with\r\nRoger Sherman, as he always voted right.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry said that the first men in the Continental\r\nCongress were Washington, Richard Henry Lee, and Roger Sherman,\r\nand, later in life, that Roger Sherman and George Mason were\r\nthe greatest statesmen he ever knew.  This statement, published\r\nin the life of Mason, was carefully verified for me by my\r\nfriend, the late William Wirt Henry, grandson and biographer\r\nof Patrick Henry, as appears by a letter from him in my possession.*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n*I attach a passage from Mr. William Wirt Henry's letter, dated\r\nDecember 28, 1892.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to be able to say that you may rely on the correctness\r\nof the passage at page 221 of Howe's Historical Collections of Va.\r\ngiving Patrick Henry's estimate of Roger Sherman.  It was furnished\r\nthe author by my father and though a youth I well remember Mr. Howe's\r\nvisit to Red Hill, my father's residence.  My father, John Henry,\r\nwas about three years of age when his father died, but his mother\r\nlong survived Patrick Henry, as did several of his older children.\r\nFrom his mother, brothers and sisters my father learned many\r\npersonal reminiscences of his father and his exceptionally\r\nretentive memory enabled him to relate them accurately.  I have\r\noften heard him relate the reminiscences given on that page by\r\nMr. Howe.\"\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, in a letter to his wife, speaks of Sherman as\r\n\"That old Puritan, as honest as an angel, and as firm in\r\nthe cause of Independence as Mt. Atlas.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable testimony to his character,\r\none almost unexampled in the history of public men, is that\r\npaid to him by Oliver Ellsworth, himself one of the greatest\r\nmen of his time,--Chief Justice of the United States, Envoy\r\nto France, leader in the Senate for the first twelve years\r\nof the Constitution, and author of the Judiciary Act.  He\r\nhad been on the Bench of the Superior Court of Connecticut,\r\nwith Mr. Sherman, for many years.  They served together in\r\nthe Continental Congress, and in the Senate of the United\r\nStates.  They were together members of the Convention that\r\nframed the Constitution, and of the State Convention in Connecticut\r\nthat adopted it.  Chief Justice Ellsworth told John Adams\r\nthat he had made Mr. Sherman his model in his youth.  Mr.\r\nAdams adds:  \"Indeed I never knew two men more alike, except\r\nthat the Chief Justice had the advantage of a liberal education,\r\nand somewhat more extensive reading.  Mr. Sherman was born\r\nin the State of Massachusetts, and was one of the strongest\r\nand soundest pillars of the Revolution.\"  It would be hard\r\nto find another case of life-long and intimate companionship\r\nbetween two public men where such a declaration by either\r\nof the other would not seem ludicrous.\r\n\r\nHe was the only person who signed all four of the great State\r\nPapers, to which the signatures of the delegates of the different\r\nColonies were attached:\r\n\r\n  The Association of 1774;\r\n  The Articles of Confederation;\r\n  The Declaration of Independence, and\r\n  The Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris signed three of them.\r\n\r\nHis tenacity, the independence of his judgment, and his influence\r\nover the great men with whom he was associated, is shown by\r\nfour striking instances among many others where he succeeded\r\nin impressing his opinion on his associates.\r\n\r\n_First:_  It is well known that the dispute between the large\r\nStates, who desired to have their votes in the National Legislature\r\ncounted in proportion to numbers, and the small States, who\r\ndesired to vote by States as equals, a dispute which nearly\r\nwrecked the attempt to frame a Constitution of the United\r\nStates, arose in the Continental Congress, and gave rise to\r\ngreat controversy there when the Articles of Confederation\r\nwere framed.  Mr. Sherman was one of the Committee that framed\r\nthose Articles, as he was afterward one of the Committee who\r\nreported the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams writes in his diary, that Mr. Sherman, in Committee\r\nof the Whole, moved August 1, 1776, that the vote be taken\r\nboth ways, once according to numbers, and a second time, when\r\nthe States should vote as equals.\r\n\r\nThis was, in substance, so far as the arrangement of political\r\npower was concerned, the plan of the Constitution.  In the\r\nConstitutional Convention, Mr. Sherman first moved this plan,\r\nknown as the Connecticut Compromise, and made the first argument\r\nin its support, to which his colleague, Oliver Ellsworth,\r\nafterward gave the weight of his powerful influence.  The\r\nConvention afterward, almost in despair of any settlement\r\nof this vexed question, referred the matter to a grand committee,\r\non which Mr. Ellsworth was originally named.  But he withdrew\r\nfrom the committee, and Mr. Sherman took his place.  Mr.\r\nSherman had the parliamentary charge of the matter from the\r\nbeginning, and at the close of the Convention, moved the provision\r\nthat no State should be deprived of its equal vote without\r\nits consent.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Sherman's known tenacity, and his influence over\r\nthe great men with whom he was associated, testified to by\r\nso many of them, is borne in mind, it seems there can be no\r\ndoubt that he is entitled to the chief credit of carrying\r\nout the scheme which he himself devised, and which, years\r\nbefore the Convention met, he himself first moved in the\r\nContinental Congress for which he made the first argument,\r\nand which was reported from the committee of which he was\r\na member, representing the State which gave the name to the\r\nCompromise.  His motion, which was adopted, that no State\r\nshould be deprived of its equal vote in the Senate without\r\nits consent, made the equality secure.*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* See Boutell's \"Life of Roger Sherman,\" Lodge's \"Flying Frigate,\r\n--Address on Ellsworth,\" Proceedings Am. Ant. Soc., October, 1902.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n_Second:_  In 1774, when Mr. Adams was on his way to the\r\nContinental Congress in Philadelphia, he records in his diary\r\nthat he met Roger Sherman at New Haven, who, he says, \"is\r\na solid and sensible man.\"  Mr. Sherman said to him that he\r\nthought the Massachusetts patriots, especially Mr. Otis,\r\nin his argument for the Writs of Assistance, had given up\r\nthe whole case when they admitted that Parliament had the\r\npower to legislate for the Colonies under any circumstances\r\nwhatever.  He lived to join in the report from the committee,\r\nand to sign the Declaration of Independence, which put the\r\ncase on his ground.  The Declaration of Independence does\r\nnot recognize Parliament at all, except indirectly, when it\r\nsays the King \"has combined with others\" to do the wrongs\r\nwhich are complained of.\r\n\r\n_Third:_  In 1752 the whole country was overrun with paper\r\nmoney.  Mr. Sherman published in that year a little pamphlet,\r\nentitled, \"A Caveat Against Injustice, or An Inquiry Into\r\nthe Evil Consequences of a Fluctuating Medium of Exchange.\"\r\nHe stated with great clearness and force the arguments which,\r\nunhappily, we have been compelled to repeat more than once\r\nin later generations.  He denounced paper money as \"a cheat,\r\nvexation, and snare, a medium whereby we are continually cheating\r\nand wronging one another in our dealings and commerce.\" He\r\nadds, \"So long as we import so much more foreign goods than\r\nare necessary, and keep so many merchants and traders employed\r\nto procure and deal them out to us: a great part of which\r\nwe might as well make among ourselves; and another great part\r\nof which we had much better be without, especially the spiritous\r\nliquors, of which vast quantities are consumed in the colony\r\nevery year, unnecessarily, to the great destruction of estates,\r\nmorals, healths and even the lives of many of the inhabitants,--\r\nI say, so long as these things are so, we shall spend a great\r\npart of our labor and substance for that which will not profit\r\nus.  Whereas, if these things were reformed, the provisions\r\nand other commodities which we might have to export yearly,\r\nand which other governments are dependent upon us for, would\r\nprocure us gold and silver abundantly sufficient for a medium\r\nof trade.  And we might be as independent, flourishing and\r\nhappy a colony as any in the British Dominions.\"\r\n\r\nHe lived to move in the Convention, and to procure its insertion\r\nin the Constitution, the clause that no State should make\r\nanything but gold and silver legal tender.\r\n\r\n_Fourth:_  Mr. Sherman took his seat in the Federal Convention\r\nMay 30, 1787.  Mr. Randolph's resolution, submitted on the\r\n29th day of May, being before the Convention the next day,\r\nincluded the proposition that the National Legislature ought\r\nto be empowered to enjoy the legislative rights vested in\r\nCongress by the confederation, \"and moreover to legislate\r\nin all cases in which the separate States are incompetent,\"\r\n--the question being whether the clause authorizing Congress\r\nto legislate in all cases in which the separate States are\r\nincompetent should be retained, every State in the Convention\r\nvoted Aye, except Connecticut.  Connecticut was divided.  Ellsworth\r\nvoted Aye, and Sherman, No.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman lived, not only to sign a Constitution of limited\r\npowers, but himself to support the Tenth Article of Amendment\r\nthereto, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,\r\nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States\r\nrespectively, or to the people.\"  The words \"or to the people\"\r\nwere moved by Mr. Sherman after the original article was reported.\r\nSo he saw clearly in the beginning, what no other member saw,\r\nthe two great American principles, first that the National\r\nGovernment should be a Government of limited and delegated\r\npowers, and next, that there is a domain of legislation which\r\nthe people have not delegated either to the National Government\r\nor to the States, and upon which no legislative power may\r\nrightfully enter.\r\n\r\nI surely am not mistaken in thinking that even without the\r\nother services of a life devoted to the public, these four\r\ncontributions to the Constitutional history of the country\r\nentitle Mr. Sherman to an honorable place in the grateful\r\nmemory of his countrymen, and vindicate the tributes which\r\nI have cited from his illustrious contemporaries.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother, the daughter of Benjamin Prescott of Salem,\r\nwas a woman of great intelligence and a great beauty in her\r\ntime.  She was once taken out to dinner by General Washington\r\nwhen he was President.  Madam Hancock, whose husband had been\r\nPresident of the Continental Congress and Governor of Massachusetts,\r\ncomplained to General Washington's Secretary, Mr. Lear, that\r\nthat honor belonged to her.  The Secretary told General Washington,\r\nthe next day, what she said.  The General answered that it\r\nwas his privilege to give his arm to the handsomest woman\r\nin the room.  Whether the reply was communicated to Mrs. Hancock,\r\nor whether she was comforted by it, does not appear.  General\r\nWashington had been a guest at my grandfather's house in my\r\nmother's childhood, and she had sat on his knee.  She was\r\nthen six years old.  But she always remembered the occasion\r\nvery vividly.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather was a friend of Lafayette, who mentions him\r\nin one of his letters, the original of which is in my possession.\r\nOne of my mother's brothers, Lt. Colonel Isaac Sherman, led\r\nthe advance at Princeton, and was himself intimate with Washington\r\nand Lafayette.  He was a very brave officer and commanded\r\na Connecticut regiment at the storming of Stony Point.  He\r\nis honorably mentioned in Gen. Wayne's report of the action.\r\nWashington alludes to him in one of his letters to Lafayette,\r\nas one of his friends whom Lafayette will be glad to see if\r\nhe will visit this country once more.  There is, in the State\r\nDepartment, an amusing correspondence between Col. Sherman\r\nand Gen. Wayne, in which he complains that Mad Anthony does\r\ngreat injustice in his report to the soldiers from other States\r\nthan Pennsylvania.  Mad Anthony was mad at the letter.  But\r\nafter a rather significant request from Gen. Washington,\r\nhe repaired the wrong.\r\n\r\nAnother of her brothers who died at the age of eighty-eight,\r\nwhen I was thirty years old, and at whose house I was often\r\na visitor, spent three weeks as Washington's guest at Mount\r\nVernon.  Old Deacon Beers of New Haven, whom I knew in his\r\nold age, was one of the guard who had Andre in custody.  During\r\nhis captivity, Andre made a pen-and-ink likeness of himself,\r\nwhich he gave to Deacon Beers.  It is now in the possession\r\nof Yale College.\r\n\r\nI had from my mother the story of General Washington taking\r\nChief Justice Ellsworth's twin children, one on each knee,\r\nand reciting to them the ballad of the Derbyshire Ram.  This\r\ntradition has remained in the Ellsworth family.  I have confirmed\r\nit by inquiry of the Rev. Mr. Wood, a grandson of Oliver Ellsworth,\r\nwho died in Washington a few years ago.\r\n\r\nBesides the uncle to whom I allude, who died in 1856, Judge\r\nSimeon Baldwin, who married two of my aunts, died in 1851,\r\naged ninety.  He was a Member of Congress in 1803-5, and was\r\nan intimate friend of Chancellor Kent, who was his classmate\r\nand chum in Yale, and was intimate with the Federalist leaders\r\nof the Hamilton party.  I several times made visits in his\r\nhousehold before his death.  President Jeremiah Day, another\r\nuncle by marriage, was at the head of Yale for thirty years.\r\nHe died in 1867, at the age of 94.\r\n\r\nMy mother's sister, Mrs. Jeremiah Evarts, was born January\r\n28, 1774, and died in 1851, at the age of seventy-seven.  She\r\nknew intimately many famous men and women of the Revolutionary\r\nperiod.  Her husband was an intimate friend of John Jay.  She\r\nhad a great deal of the sprightly wit for which her son, William,\r\nwas so famous.  She was at home at the time of Washington's\r\nvisit, then a child eleven years old, and opened the door\r\nfor him when he took his leave.  The General, who was very\r\nfond of children, put his hand on her head and said, \"My little\r\nlady, I wish you a better office.\" She dropped a courtesy\r\nand answered, quick as lightning, \"Yes, sir; to let you in.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Evarts was a woman not only of sprightly wit, but of\r\ngreat beauty.  She liked to tell in her old age of a dinner\r\nwhich John Hancock gave for her father and her, in Boston,\r\nwhen she was a girl.  She described her dress with great\r\nminuteness, and added naively, \"Didn't I look pretty?\"\r\n\r\nMy mother, who was married in 1812, knew very intimately many\r\nof her father's and mother's old friends who had been distinguished\r\nin the public service in the Revolutionary period and the\r\nAdministration of Washington and John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.\r\nShe knew very well the family of John Jay.  He and his wife\r\nwere visitors at my grandmother's after their return from\r\nSpain.  My mother was intimate in the household of Oliver\r\nEllsworth as in a second home.  His children were her playmates.\r\nShe was also very intimate indeed with the family of Senator\r\nHillhouse, whose daughter Mary was one of her dearest friends.\r\n\r\nSenator Hillhouse held a very high place in the public life\r\nof Connecticut in his day.  He was one of the friends of Hamilton,\r\nand one of the group of Federal statesmen of whom Hamilton\r\nwas the leader.  He was United States Senator for Connecticut\r\nfrom 1796 to 1810.\r\n\r\nAfter she became a young lady, my mother, with Fanny Ellsworth,\r\nafterward Mrs. Wood, and Mary Hillhouse, daughter of the Senator,\r\nestablished a school to teach young colored children to read\r\nand sew.  The colored people in New Haven were in a sad condition\r\nin those days.  The law of the State made it a penal offence\r\nto teach a colored child to read.  These girls violated the\r\nlaw.  The public authorities interfered and threatened them\r\nwith prosecution.  But the young women were resolute.  They\r\ninsisted that they were performing a religious duty, and declared\r\nthat they should disobey the law and take the consequences.\r\nA good deal of sympathy was aroused in their behalf.  The\r\nNew Haven authorities had to face the question whether they\r\nwould imprison the daughter of a Signer of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, who had affixed his signature to the great\r\naffirmation that all men are created equal, the daughters of\r\ntwo Framers of the Constitution, and the daughter of James\r\nHillhouse, then the foremost citizen of Connecticut, for\r\nteaching little children to read the Bible.  They gave up the\r\nattempt.  The school kept on and flourished.  President Dwight\r\nraised a considerable fund for it by a course of lectures,\r\nand it continued down to within my own recollection.  What\r\nbecame of the fund which was raised for its support I cannot\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Evarts was born February 13, 1781.  He died May 10,\r\n1831.  He was the founder and Secretary of the American Board\r\nof Commissioners for Foreign Missions.  He was one of the\r\nthirteen men who met in Samuel Dexter's office in 1812, to\r\ninaugurate the Temperance Reformation.  The habit of excessive\r\ndrinking was then almost universal in this country.  Liquors\r\nand wines were freely used on social occasions, at weddings\r\nand at funerals.  The clergyman staggered home from his round\r\nof pastoral calls, and the bearers partook of brandy or gin\r\nor rum in the room adjoining that where the coffin was placed\r\nready for the funeral.  A gentleman present said it was utterly\r\nimpracticable to try and wean the American people from the habit of\r\ndrinking.  Jeremiah Evarts answered, \"It is right, therefore\r\npracticable.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a Puritan of the old school.  He made a vigorous but\r\nineffectual attempt in Connecticut to enforce the Sunday\r\nlaws.  His death was caused by his exertions in resisting\r\nthe removal of the Cherokee Indians from Georgia, a removal\r\naccomplished in violation of the Constitution and of public\r\nfaith.  The Supreme Court of the United States declared the\r\nlaw of Georgia unconstitutional.  But Georgia defied the mandate\r\nof the Court, and it was never executed.  The missionary agent\r\nwas imprisoned and died of his confinement.  Mr. Evarts said,\r\n\"There is a court that has power to execute its judgments.\"\r\n\r\nI told this story to Horace Maynard, an eminent member of\r\nCongress and a member of the Cabinet.  Mr. Maynard said, \"There\r\nwas never a prophecy more terribly accomplished.  The territory\r\nfrom which those Indians were unlawfully removed was the scene\r\nof the Battle of Missionary Ridge, which is not far from the\r\ngrave of Worcester, the missionary who died in prison.  That\r\nland was fairly drenched with blood and honeycombed with graves.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Evarts edited the _Panoplist,_ a very able magazine which\r\npowerfully defended the old theology against the Unitarian\r\nmovement, then at its height.\r\n\r\nA well-known writer, Rev. Leonard W. Bacon, published a short\r\ntime ago a sketch entitled, \"The Greater Evarts,\" in which\r\nhe contrasted the career of Jeremiah Evarts with that of his\r\nbrilliant and delightful son.  Whether that judgment shall\r\nstand we may know when the question is settled, which is to\r\nbe answered in every generation, whether martyrdom be a failure.\r\n\r\nAmong the inmates of my grandfather's household in my mother's\r\nchildhood and youth was Roger Minott Sherman.  He was the\r\nson of the Reverend Josiah Sherman, my grandfather's brother,\r\na clergyman of Woburn, Massachusetts, where Roger Minott was\r\nborn.  His father died in 1789.  My grandfather took the boy\r\ninto his household and educated him and treated him as a son,\r\nand just before his death gave him his watch, which is now\r\nin the possession of a son of General Sherman.\r\n\r\nRoger Minott Sherman was unquestionably the ablest lawyer\r\nin New England who never obtained distinction in political\r\nlife, and, with the exception of Daniel Webster and Jeremiah\r\nMason and Rufus Choate, the ablest New England ever produced.*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* See Appendix.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nRoger Minott Sherman's father died in 1789.  The widow wrote\r\nto some of her friends to see what assistance could be obtained\r\nto enable her son to continue his studies at Yale.  It was\r\napparently in response to this appeal that Mr. Sherman wrote\r\nthe following letter to his nephew.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, April 28, 1790.\r\n\r\n_Dear Nephew,_--I would have you continue your studies and\r\nremain at my house as you have done hitherto.  I hope you\r\nwill be provided for so as to complete your education at College,\r\nand lay a foundation for future usefulness.  When I return\r\nhome I shall take such further order respecting it as may\r\nbe proper.  I shall afford you as much assistance as under\r\nmy circumstances may be prudent.\r\n\r\n  I am your affectionate uncle,\r\n  ROGER SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman died a year after his nephew graduated; but before\r\nhe died he doubtless saw the promise of that distinguished\r\ncareer which added new lustre to the Sherman name.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather remarkable fact that my mother had such close\r\nrelations to so many eminent lawyers.  Her father, though\r\nhis public duties prevented him from practising law very long,\r\nwas a very great lawyer and judge.  Her brother-in-law, Judge\r\nBaldwin, was an eminent Judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court.\r\nHer cousin, Roger Minott Sherman, as has just been said, was\r\nan inmate of her father's household in her childhood, and\r\nwas to her as a brother.  She had, after his mother's death,\r\nthe care of Senator Roger Sherman Baldwin, her nephew, who\r\nwas for many years at the head of the Connecticut Bar.  To\r\nher nephew, William M. Evarts, my father's house was as another\r\nhome in his boyhood.  He was the leading advocate of his time.\r\nHer son, E. R. Hoar, was Attorney General of the United\r\nStates.  And her husband was in his day one of the foremost\r\nadvocates of Massachusetts.  So, with a little alteration,\r\nthe Greek epitaph of the woman who was the daughter, wife,\r\nsister and mother of princes, might apply to her, if, as I like\r\nto think, a first-rate American lawyer is entitled to as much\r\nrespect as a petty Greek prince.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nSAMUEL HOAR\r\n\r\nI was born in Concord August 29, 1826.  My grandfather, two\r\ngreat-grandfathers, and three of my father's uncles were at\r\nConcord Bridge in the Lincoln Company, of which my grandfather,\r\nSamuel Hoar, whom I well remember, was lieutenant, on the\r\n19th of April, 1775.  The deposition of my great-grandfather,\r\nJohn Hoar, with a few others, relating to the events of that\r\nday, was taken by the patriots and sent to England by a fast-\r\nsailing ship, which reached London before the official news\r\nof the battle at Concord came from the British commander.\r\nJohn had previously been a soldier in the old French War and\r\nwas a prisoner among the Indians for three months.  His life\r\nwas not a very conspicuous one.  He had been a Selectman of\r\nLexington, dwelling in the part of the town afterward incorporated\r\nwith Lincoln.  There is in existence a document manumitting\r\nhis slave, which, I am happy to say, is the only existing\r\nevidence that any ancestor of mine ever owned one.\r\n\r\nMy father's grandfather, on the mother's side, was Colonel\r\nAbijah Peirce, of Lincoln.  He was prominent in Middlesex\r\nCounty from a time preceding the Revolutionary War down to\r\nhis death.  He was one of the Committee of the Town who had\r\ncharge of corresponding with other towns and with the Committee\r\nof Safety in Boston.  The day before the battle at Concord\r\nBridge, he had been chosen Colonel of a regiment of Minute\r\nMen.  But he had not got his commission, taken the oath, or\r\ngot his equipments.  So he went into the battle as a private\r\nin the company in which his son-in-law was lieutenant, armed\r\nwith nothing but a cane.  After the first volley was exchanged\r\nhe crossed the bridge and took the cartridge-box and musket\r\nof one of the two British soldiers who were killed, which\r\nhe used during the day.  The gun was preserved for a long\r\ntime in his family, and came to my grandfather, after his\r\ndeath.  It was the first trophy of the Revolutionary War taken\r\nin battle.  Such things, however, were not prized in those\r\ndays as they are now.  One of my uncles lent the musket to\r\none of his neighbors for the celebration of the taking of\r\nCornwallis, and it never was brought back.  We would give\r\nits weight in gold to get it back.\r\n\r\nI will put on record two stories about Colonel Peirce, which\r\nhave something of a superstitious quality in them.  I have\r\nno doubt of their truth, as they come from persons absolutely\r\ntruthful and not superstitious or credulous themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Peirce was seventy years old, he told his wife\r\nand my aunt, her granddaughter, from whom I heard the story,\r\nwho was then a grown-up young woman, that he was going out\r\nto the barn and going up to the high beams.  In those days\r\nthe farmers' barns had the hay in bays on each side, and over\r\nthe floor in the middle rails were laid across from one side\r\nto the other, on which corn-stalks, for bedding the cattle,\r\nand other light things were put.  They urged him not to go,\r\nand said an old man like him should not take such risks; to\r\nwhich he replied by dancing a hornpipe in the room in their\r\npresence, showing something of that exhilaration of spirit\r\nwhich the Scotch called being \"fey\" and which they regard\r\nas a presage of approaching misfortune.  He went out, and\r\nwithin a few minutes fell from the high beams down to the\r\nfloor and was instantly killed.\r\n\r\nThe other story is that a little while before this happened\r\nhe said that he thought he saw the dim and misty figure of\r\na ship pass slowly from one side of the barn to the other,\r\nunder the roof.\r\n\r\nA like story is told of Abraham Lincoln; that he used to\r\nsee a vision of a ship before any great event, and that it\r\ncame to him the night before he died.\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Secretary Hay about the Lincoln anecdote and give\r\nhis reply.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, April 18, 1903.\r\n\r\n_Dear Senator Hoar:_\r\n\r\nYou will find on page 281 of Volume 10 of \"The Life of Lincoln,\"\r\nby Nicolay and Hay, all I know about the story.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, in an interview with the President, on the\r\n14th of April--the day he was shot--expressed some anxiety\r\nas to the news from Sherman.  \"The President answered him\r\nin that singular vein of poetic mysticism, which, though constantly\r\nheld in check by his strong common sense, formed a remarkable\r\nelement in his character.  He assured Grant that the news\r\nwould come soon and come favorable, for he had last night\r\nhad his usual dream which preceded great events.  He seemed\r\nto be, he said, in a singular and indescribable vessel, but\r\nalways the same, moving with great rapidity towards a dark\r\nand indefinite shore.  He had had this dream before Antietam,\r\nMurfreesboro, Gettysburg and Vicksburg.\"\r\n\r\nThe story is also found in George Eliot's Life (Vol. 3, 113),\r\nas related by Charles Dickens on the authority of Stanton,\r\nwith characteristic amplifications.\r\n\r\n  Yours faithfully,\r\n  JOHN HAY.\r\n  The Honorable\r\n  George F. Hoar\r\n  United States Senate\r\n\r\nMy father, Samuel Hoar of Concord, was born in 1778 and died\r\nin 1856.  He was one of the most eminent lawyers at the Massachusetts\r\nBar.  To this statement I can give better testimony than my\r\nown, in the following letter from the Honorable Eben F. Stone,\r\nlate member of Congress from the Essex District.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON 9 March, '84.\r\n\r\n_My dear Mr. Hoar:_\r\n\r\nWhen I was a law student, I dined at Ipswich in our county,\r\nwith the Judges of the Supreme Court and the members of the\r\nEssex Bar, who then had a room and a table by themselves.\r\nThe conversation took a professional turn, and a good deal\r\nwas said about Mr. Choate's great skill and success as an\r\nadvocate.  Judge Shaw then remarked that, sitting at nisi\r\nprius in different parts of the State, he had had an opportunity\r\nto compare the different lawyers who were distinguished for\r\ntheir success with juries, and that there was no man in the\r\nState, in his opinion, who had so much influence with a jury\r\nas Sam Hoar of Concord.  This he ascribed not simply to his\r\nlegal ability, but largely to the confidence the people had\r\nin his integrity and moral character.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n  E. F. STONE.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoar was associated with Mr. Webster in the defence of\r\nJudge Prescott when he was impeached before the Senate of\r\nMassachusetts.  He encountered Webster, and Choate, and Jeremiah\r\nMason, and John Davis, and the elder Marcus Morton, and other\r\ngiants of the Bar, in many a hard battle.  Mr. Webster makes\r\naffectionate reference to him in a letter to my brother, now\r\nin existence.  He was a member of the Harrisburg Convention\r\nwhich nominated General Harrison for the Presidency in 1839.\r\nHe represented Concord in the Massachusetts Convention to\r\nRevise the Constitution, in 1820, in which convention his\r\nfather, Samuel Hoar, represented Lincoln.  When he first rose\r\nto speak in that body, John Adams said, \"That young man reminds\r\nme of my old friend, Roger Sherman.\" He was a Federalist,\r\nafterward a Whig, and in the last years of his life a Republican.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoar succeeded Edward Everett as Representative in Congress\r\nfrom the Middlesex District in 1835.  He served there but\r\na single term.  He made one speech, a Constitutional argument\r\nin support of the power of Congress to abolish slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia.  He also took rather a prominent\r\npart in a discussion in which the Whig members complained\r\nof one of the rulings of the Democratic speaker.\r\n\r\nHis service was not long enough to gain for him any considerable\r\nnational distinction.  But that he made a good impression\r\non the House appears from an extract of a letter I lately\r\nreceived from my classmate, Rev. Walter Mitchell, the author\r\nof the spirited and famous poem, \"Tacking Ship off Fire Island.\"\r\nHe says:  \"I heard your uncle, Mr. Eliot, say that when your\r\nfather went to Congress the Southern members said, 'Where\r\nhas this man been all his life, and why have we never heard\r\nof him?  With us a man of his ability would be known all over\r\nthe South.'\"\r\n\r\nMy father retired from active practice at the Bar shortly\r\nafter his return from Congress in 1837.  In 1844 an event\r\noccurred which contributed largely to the bitter feeling\r\nbetween the two sections of the country, which brought on the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, under the laws of South Carolina, colored\r\nseamen on ships that went into the port of Charleston were\r\nimprisoned during the stay of the ship, and sold to pay their\r\njail fees if the ship went off and left them, or if the fees\r\nwere not paid.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Massachusetts directed the Governor to\r\nemploy counsel to test the constitutionality of these laws.\r\nNo Southern lawyer of sufficient ability and distinction could\r\nbe found who would undertake the duty.  The Governor found\r\nit difficult to procure counsel who were in active practice.\r\nMr. Hoar was led by a strong sense of duty to leave his retirement\r\nin his old age and undertake the delicate and dangerous mission.\r\nWhen he arrived in South Carolina and made known his errand,\r\nthe people of the State, especially of the city of Charleston,\r\nwere deeply excited.  The Legislature passed angry resolutions,\r\ndirecting the Governor to expel from the State, \"the Northern\r\nemissary\" whose presence was deemed an insult.  The mob of\r\nCharleston threatened to destroy the hotel where Mr. Hoar\r\nwas staying.  He was urged to leave the city, which he firmly\r\nand steadfastly refused to do.  The mob were quieted by the\r\nassurances of leading gentlemen that Mr. Hoar would be removed.\r\nA deputation of seventy principal citizens waited upon him\r\nat his hotel and requested him to consent to depart.  He\r\nhad already declined the urgent request of Dr. Whittredge,\r\nan eminent physician, to withdraw and take refuge at his\r\nplantation, saying he was too old to run and could not go\r\nback to Massachusetts if he had returned without an attempt\r\nto discharge his duty.  The committee told him that they\r\nhad assured the people that he should be removed, and that\r\nhe must choose between stepping voluntarily into a carriage\r\nand being taken to the boat, or being dragged by force.  He\r\nthen, and not until then, said he would go.  He was taken by\r\nthe committee to the boat, which sailed for Wilmington.\r\n\r\nIt has generally been said that Mr. Hoar was driven from\r\nCharleston by a mob.  This I suppose to be technically true.\r\nBut it is not true in the popular sense of the words.  The\r\ncommittee of seventy, although they had no purpose of personal\r\nviolence, other than to place one old gentleman in a carriage\r\nand take him to a boat, were, of course, in every legal sense\r\na mob.  But when that committee waited upon him the personal\r\ndanger was over.\r\n\r\nA solitary negative vote against the resolve of the Legislature\r\ndirecting Mr. Hoar to be expelled was cast by C. S. Memmenger,\r\nafterward Secretary of the Treasury of the Southern Confederacy.\r\nHe is said to have been a Union man in 1832.\r\n\r\nI was told by General Hurlburt of Illinois, a distinguished\r\nofficer in the Civil War, and member of the national House\r\nof Representatives, that at the time of my father's mission\r\nto South Carolina, he was a law student in the office of\r\nJames L. Petigru.  Mr. Petigru, as is well known, was a Union\r\nman during the Civil War.  Such, however, was the respect\r\nfor his great ability and character that he was permitted\r\nto live in Charleston throughout the War.  It is said that\r\non one occasion while this strife was going on, a stranger\r\nin Charleston met Mr. Petigru in the street and asked him\r\nthe way to the Insane Hospital.  To this the old man answered\r\nby pointing north, south, east and west, and said, \"You will\r\nfind the Insane Hospital in every direction here.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to General Hurlburt, Mr. Petigru had quietly organized\r\na company of young men whom he could trust, who were ready,\r\nunder his lead, to rescue Mr. Hoar and insure his personal\r\nsafety if he were attacked by the mob.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams says in his diary, speaking of the transaction:\r\n\"I approved the whole of his conduct.\" Governor Briggs, in\r\ncommunicating the facts to the Legislature, says in a special\r\nmessage:  \"The conduct of Mr. Hoar under the circumstances\r\nseems to have been marked by that prudence, firmness and wisdom\r\nwhich have distinguished his character through his life.\"\r\nMr. Emerson says, in a letter dated December 17, 1844:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hoar has just come home from Carolina, and gave me this\r\nmorning a narrative of his visit.  He had behaved admirably\r\nwell, I judge, and there were fine heroic points in his story.\r\nOne expression struck me, which, he said, he regretted a little\r\nafterward, as it might sound a little vapouring.  A gentleman\r\nwho was very much his friend called him into a private room\r\nto say that the danger from the populace had increased to\r\nsuch a degree that he must now insist on Mr. Hoar's leaving\r\nthe city at once, and he showed him where he might procure\r\na carriage and where he might safely stop on the way to his\r\nplantation, which he would reach the next morning.  Mr. Hoar\r\nthanked him but told him again that he could not and would\r\nnot go, and that he had rather his broken skull should be\r\ncarried to Massachusetts by somebody else, than to carry it\r\nhome safe himself whilst his duty required him to remain.\r\nThe newspapers say, following the Charleston papers, that\r\nhe consented to depart: this he did not, but in every instance\r\nrefused,--to the Sheriff, and acting Mayor, to his friends, and\r\nto the committee of the S. C. Association, and only went\r\nwhen they came in crowds with carriages to conduct him to\r\nthe boat, and go he must,--then he got into the coach himself,\r\nnot thinking it proper to be dragged.\"\r\n\r\nI add this letter from Dr. Edward Everett Hale.\r\n\r\n39 HIGHLAND ST., ROXBURY, MASS., Mar. 13, 1884.\r\n\r\n_Dear Hoar:_\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your memoir of your father.  I was\r\nin Washington the day he and your sister came home from Charleston.\r\nI remember that Grinnell told me the news--and my first real\r\nfeeling _in life_ that there must be a war, was when Grinnell\r\nsaid on the Avenue:  \"I do not know but we may as well head\r\nthe thing off now--and fight it out.\" The first public intelligence\r\nthe North had of the matter was in my letter to the _Daily\r\nAdvertiser,_ which was reprinted in New York, their own correspondents\r\nnot knowing of the expulsion.\r\n\r\n  Always yours,\r\n  EDW. E. HALE.\r\n\r\nI have Dr. Vedder's permission to publish the accompanying\r\ncorrespondence, which so happily turns into a means of delightful\r\nreconciliation what has been so long, but can be no longer,\r\na painful memory.  I was received in Charleston with the delightful\r\nhospitality of which no other people in the world so fully\r\nunderstand the secret.\r\n\r\nCHARLESTON, S. C., Oct. 20, 1898.\r\n  THE HONORABLE GEORGE F. HOAR.\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\nWe have a New England Society in Charleston which is now seventy-\r\nsix years old.  It has had a notable history, Daniel Webster\r\nhaving been among its annual orators.  Its Forefathers' Anniversary\r\nis the social and literary event of our year.  I write to\r\nextend the warm greeting of the Society to yourself, and the\r\nearnest request that you will be our guest at the banquet\r\non Forefathers' Day Dec. 22, and speak to the sentiment--\r\n\"The Day we Celebrate,\" or any other that you would prefer.\r\nOf course, it will be our privilege to make your coming wholly\r\nwithout cost to yourself.  May I venture to urge that your\r\npresence with us will have a beautiful significance in its\r\nrelation to the good feeling which so happily obtains in all\r\nour land, and a past event which associates your honored Father's\r\nname so memorably and sadly with our City?  Charleston would\r\nfain give the honored Son a welcome which shall obliterate\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n  Hoping for a favorable and early reply, I remain,\r\n  Yours with great respect,\r\n  CHARLES S. VEDDER, _President._\r\n\r\n\r\nWORCESTER, MASS., October 26, 1898.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\nI am sure you will not doubt that I feel myself highly honored\r\nby your invitation in behalf of the New England Society of\r\nCharleston, as I am deeply touched and gratified by what you\r\nsay in the letter which conveys it.  I thank God that I have\r\nlived to behold this day, and that my eyes have been spared\r\nto see the people of the whole country united again in affection\r\nas in the early time.\r\n\r\nI hope and expect to be able to attend your banquet next\r\nForefathers' Day.  I will do so if the condition of the public\r\nbusiness shall permit.  I have the charge of the business of\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary, two of whose important members\r\nare now absent in Paris, and it is of course possible that\r\nsome of the great questions which are before us may require\r\nconstant attendance in their places of all the Senators during\r\nthe next session without the possibility of interruption for\r\na Christmas holiday.  Subject to that possibility, I will\r\naccept your invitation, and am, with high regard,\r\n\r\n  Faithfully yours,\r\n  GEO. F. HOAR.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, after he had withdrawn from professional and public\r\nlife, being then seventy-two years old, Mr. Hoar was sent\r\nto the House of Representatives, by the town of Concord, to\r\noppose the removal of the courts from Concord.  He was successful\r\nin the opposition.  He had, during the winter, an opportunity\r\nto render a very important service to Harvard College.  There\r\nwas a vigorous and dangerous attempt to abolish the existing\r\nCorporation, and transfer the property and control of the\r\nCollege to a board of fifteen persons, to be chosen by the\r\nLegislature by joint ballot, one third to go out of office\r\nevery second year.  This measure was recommended in an elaborate\r\nreport by Mr. Boutwell, an influential member of the House,\r\nchosen Governor at the next election, and advocated by Henry\r\nWilson, afterward Senator and Vice-President, and by other\r\ngentlemen of great influence.  All the members of the Corporation\r\nwere Whigs in politics and Unitarians, a sect containing a\r\nvery small proportion of the people of the State.  The project\r\nto take the College from their control was very popular.  The\r\nHouse listened willingly to the able arguments with which\r\nthe measure was introduced, and before Mr. Hoar spoke its\r\nopinion was unmistakable for the bill.  He argued that the\r\nmeasure was in conflict with the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and defended the College with great earnestness from\r\nthe charge that it had \"failed to answer the just expectations\r\nof the public.\"  The Boston _Daily Atlas,_ edited by General\r\nSchouler, then a member of the House, said the next day of\r\nthis speech:  \"The argument of Mr. Hoar was of transcendent\r\nexcellence, and had a most overpowering effect upon the House.\r\nWe regret that no report was made of it.  It is a pity that\r\nso much learning, argument and eloquence should be lost.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech caused a revolution in the opinion of the body.\r\nThe measure was referred to the next General Court.  Mr. Hoar\r\nwas employed by the Corporation as counsel to appear before\r\nthe Legislature the next winter in its behalf.  But the measure\r\nwas never heard of afterward.  Dr. Walker said of this occurrence,\r\nafter his sententious fashion:  \"Other men have served the\r\nCollege; Samuel Hoar saved it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board of Overseers, who have visitorial powers over the\r\nCollege, and whose concurrence is necessary to the election\r\nor appointment of officers, Professors and members of the\r\nCorporation, and who included for a long time the Governor,\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and members of the Senate, had always\r\nbeen held to be the representative of the Commonwealth, although\r\nthe members of the body who were not members _ex-officio_\r\nwere elected by the Board itself.\r\n\r\nA bill passed in 1851, to which no objection was made, vested\r\nthe election of this body in the Legislature.  But after a\r\nfew years' trial, that was abandoned, and the members of the\r\nOverseers are now chosen by the Alumni of the College.\r\n\r\nI shall speak in a later chapter of the foundation of the\r\nFree Soil Party.  The call for the Convention held at Worcester\r\non the 28th of June, 1848, addressed to all persons opposed\r\nto the election of Cass and Taylor, written by his son, E.\r\nR. Hoar, was headed by Mr. Hoar.  He presided over the meeting,\r\nand delegates were elected to a National Convention to be\r\nheld at Buffalo, which nominated Van Buren and Adams for President\r\nand Vice-President.  This was the origin of the Republican\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAfter 1848, Mr. Hoar did not relax his efforts to bring about\r\na union of all parties in the North, in opposition to further\r\nencroachments of the slave power.  In accomplishing this end,\r\nhis age, the regard in which he was held by all classes of\r\npeople, his known disinterestedness and independence, fitted\r\nhim to exert a large influence.  The Free Soil movement had\r\nled to the formation of a party in Massachusetts, small in\r\nnumbers, but zealous, active, in earnest, containing many\r\nable leaders, eloquent orators, and vigorous writers.  They\r\nhad sent Charles Allen to the lower House of Congress, and\r\nSumner and Rantoul to the Senate.  But they had apparently\r\nmade little impression on the national strength of either\r\nof the old parties.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, the passage of the measure known as the Kansas-\r\nNebraska Bill afforded a new opportunity.  A meeting of citizens\r\nof Concord appointed a committee, of which Mr. Hoar was Chairman,\r\nand A. G. Fay, Secretary, who called a meeting of prominent\r\npersons from different parts of the State to meet at the American\r\nHouse in Boston, to take measures for forming a new party\r\nand calling a State Convention.  This Convention was held\r\nat Worcester on the 7th of September, and formed a party under\r\nthe name of Republican, and nominated candidates for State\r\noffices.  Its meeting has been claimed to be the foundation\r\nof the Republican party of Massachusetts, and its twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary was celebrated accordingly in 1879.  But\r\nit effected little more than to change the name of the Free\r\nSoil party.  Few Whigs or Democrats united to the movement.\r\nA secret organization called Americans, or Know-Nothings,\r\nswept the Commonwealth like a wave, electing all the State\r\nofficers, and, with scarcely an exception, the entire Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe candidate for Governor nominated by the Republicans at\r\nWorcester, himself joined the Know-Nothings, and labored to\r\ndefeat his own election.\r\n\r\nThe next year the attempt was more successful.  On the 10th\r\nof August, 1855, a meeting without distinction of party was\r\nheld at Chapman Hall, in Boston, which was addressed by Mr.\r\nHoar, George Bliss, Franklin Dexter, William Brigham, Lyman\r\nBeecher, Richard H. Dana, Jr., Charles F. Adams, Henry Wilson,\r\nStephen C. Phillips, and others.  On the 30th of the same\r\nmonth, a meeting of conference committees was held, representing\r\nthe American or Know-Nothing party, the Know-Somethings, an\r\nantislavery organization which had held a National Convention\r\nat Cleveland in June, and the Chapman Hall Convention.  This\r\nconference appointed a committee of twenty-six to call a State\r\nConvention, at the head of which they placed Mr. Hoar.  This\r\nState Convention was held at Worcester, nominated Julius\r\nRockwell for Governor, and the organization which it created\r\nhas constituted the Republican party of Massachusetts to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe part taken in calling this Convention, and in promoting\r\nthe union which gave it birth, was Mr. Hoar's last important\r\npublic service.  His failing health prevented his taking an\r\nactive share in the Presidential campaign of 1856.\r\n\r\nI prefer, in putting on record this brief estimate of a character\r\nwhich has been to me the principal object of reverence and\r\nhonor in my life, to use the language of others, and not\r\nmy own.  From many tributes to my father's character, from\r\npersons more impartial than I can be, I have selected two\r\nor three.\r\n\r\nI cannot quote at length Ralph Waldo Emerson's sketches of\r\nMr. Hoar, who was his near neighbor and intimate personal\r\nfriend for many years.  They are noble and faithful as portraits\r\nof Van Dyke or Titian.  One of them is a speech made in Concord\r\ntown-meeting on the third day of November, 1856, the day after\r\nMr. Hoar's death.  The other was contributed to the _Unitarian\r\nMonthly Religious Magazine,_ then edited by Rev. Dr. Huntington,\r\nafterward Bishop of New York.  Mr. Emerson says in one of\r\nthem:  \"His head, with singular grace in its lines, had a\r\nresemblance to the bust of Dante.  He retained to the last\r\nthe erectness of his tall but slender form, and not less the\r\nfull strength of his mind.  Such was, in old age, the beauty\r\nof his person and carriage, as if his mind radiated, and made\r\nthe same impression of probity on all beholders.\"\r\n\r\nHe ends with this quatrain:\r\n\r\n  With beams December planets dart,\r\n  His cold eye truth and conduct scanned;\r\n  July was in his sunny heart,\r\n  October in his liberal hand.\r\n\r\nThe following is from a letter of Sherman Day, a man whose\r\nreputation for wisdom and integrity is among the treasures\r\nof California:\r\n\r\n\"BERKELEY, 23d May, 1884.\r\n  HON. GEO. FRISBIE HOAR,\r\n  U. S. Senate, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\n\"I was very much gratified to receive, some weeks since,\r\na copy of your biographical sketch of your venerable father.\r\nIt was the more precious to me because it awakened memories\r\nof my own early life; while it recalls the tall, the gentle\r\nand dignified figure and courteous demeanor of your father\r\nin his prime of life.  I can remember being at your father's\r\nwedding at my grandmother's house when I was about 6-1/2\r\nyears old.  Several years before you were born, I was at\r\nthe Phillips Academy at Andover, and used occasionally to\r\nspend a vacation with my beloved aunt, who was a sort of\r\nmother to me in my earliest childhood.  It was at her home\r\nthat I first read Washington Irving's Sketch Book, then just\r\nappearing in separate numbers.  I believe the book belonged\r\nto a law student of your father's, as your father had not\r\nyet taken to the reading of romances.\r\n\r\n\"My memory extends back to the organization of the Constitutional\r\nConvention of 1820.  I well remember the venerable figure\r\nof John Adams, as he took the seat of honor at the right hand\r\nof the president, and I remember the sonorous voice of Josiah\r\nQuincy, the Secretary.  I was staying at the house of Mr.\r\nEvarts, and remember your father's dining there, and discussing\r\nthe deportment and characteristics of several of the more\r\nprominent members.  Among them was the tall member from Worcester,\r\nLevi Lincoln, conspicuous by his drab overcoat, by his frequent\r\nspeaking, and by his constantly moving about among the members.\r\nThe member who made the most lasting impression on my memory\r\nwas Daniel Webster.  He was not yet forty years old, stalwart,\r\nblack haired and black eyed, with a somewhat swarthy complexion;\r\nhis manly beauty and his eloquence being alike objects of\r\nadmiration.  He had not attained that stoutness which his\r\nform assumed in later years.  I could illustrate his appearance\r\nbetter to your brother, Edward, by asking him to recall Don\r\nPablo de la Guerra of Santa Barbara, whom I deemed a very\r\ngood type, _in appearance,_ of Webster in the Convention of\r\n1820.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge William Curtis came to know Mr. Hoar very well during\r\nhis own life in Concord.  He and his brother, Burrill, were\r\nalmost daily visitors at our house:\r\n\r\nWEST NEW BRIGHTON, STATEN ISLAND, N. Y.,\r\n  March 19, 1884.\r\n\r\n_My dear Mr. Hoar:_\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for a copy of your sketch of your father\r\nwhich vividly recalls him to me as I remember him in my Concord\r\ndays long ago.  I recollect that when I saw in Paris Couture's\r\nfamous picture of the Decadence of the Romans, it was your\r\nfather that I thought of as I saw the figures of the older\r\nRomans gazing reproachfully upon the revels.  So he may have\r\nfelt of his country as he died.\r\n\r\n  With great regard, very truly yours,\r\n  GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.\r\n\r\nThe following is from J. Evarts Greene, formerly editor of\r\nthe Worcester _Spy,_ and one of the ablest members of his\r\nprofession in New England:\r\n\r\nWORCESTER, Mar. 10, 1884.\r\n\r\n_My dear Mr. Hoar:_\r\n\r\nI want to thank you especially for the copy of the Memoir\r\nof your father, which I received to-day.  I am exceedingly\r\nglad to have it on your account and his.  He is the most venerable\r\nfigure in my memory.  He was always spoken of in our family\r\nwith the highest respect, and few things have ever gratified\r\nme so much as his kindness to me on the occasion of my last\r\nvisit to Concord during his lifetime.  It was in 1850, I think,\r\nwhile I was in college and about fifteen years old.  I had\r\nalways held him in awe as the greatest and wisest man within\r\nmy knowledge, and should have no more have thought of familiar\r\nconversation with him than with the Pope.  But his grave and\r\nkindly courtesy, as he sat down with me after supper, though\r\nit did not quite put me at my ease, gave me courage to talk\r\nmore freely than I had ever thought possible; and while my\r\nveneration for him was not diminished, I felt that there was\r\nno one now on earth that I need be afraid of.\r\n\r\n  Faithfully yours,\r\n  J. EVARTS GREENE.\r\n  The Hon. Geo. F. Hoar.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is from Professor Thatcher, the eminent\r\nLatin Professor of Yale:\r\n\r\nNEW HAVEN, 14th March, 1884.\r\n  HONORABLE GEORGE F. HOAR.\r\n\r\n_My dear Senator:_\r\n\r\nI write simply but cordially to thank you for the copy of\r\nyour venerated Father's Memoir which you have been so kind\r\nas to send to your cousin, Elizabeth.  I have read it with\r\nthe delight which must be common to all who read it.  A life\r\nso qualified with the selectest traits of a great and gentle\r\nsoul, so substantial with continual but full and unembarrassed\r\nlabor, and so constantly influential for elevated and beneficent\r\nends, with nothing discoverable in it to check its great drift\r\nand power,--such a life is an almost unequalled gift of God\r\nto such a community as his.  There is a rare charm in the\r\nnarrative, and one cannot help rejoicing that you have been\r\nable to gather together the recorded judgments of so many\r\nmen whose judgments are worthy to be recorded,\r\n\r\n  I am, ever,\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n  THOMAS A. THATCHER.\r\n\r\nSENATE, WASHINGTON, March 9, 1884.\r\n\r\n_My dear Mr. Hoar:_\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for a copy of the Memoir of your father.\r\nIt is a tribute to his worth and fame worthy of him and of\r\nyourself.  I hardly know which most to admire, the character\r\nit portrays, or the filial piety it evinces.\r\n\r\nIt brings back very vividly the venerable form and the lovely\r\ncharacter I met and revered in the Massachusetts Legislature\r\nwhen I was a young man, and have ever since held among the\r\nsafest and best of the land.  Permit me to count it my own\r\nbest fortune that I can subscribe myself the colleague and\r\nfriend of the son and biographer of Samuel Hoar.\r\n\r\n  Truly yours,\r\n  H. L. DAWES.\r\n  The Honorable Geo. F. Hoar,\r\n  Senate.\r\n\r\nHONORABLE GEO. F. HOAR\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_\r\n\r\nThanks for the \"Memoir of Samuel Hoar, by his Son, George\r\nF. Hoar.\"\r\n\r\nFor years the character of this true man, as a noble, courageous,\r\nself-sacrificing and independent American citizen has commanded\r\nmy profound admiration and respect, and I am greatly pleased\r\nto become more familiar with his life.  Fortunately the facts\r\nof it need no ornamentation or partial painting by the Son,\r\nfor the modesty of the latter would never have responded to\r\nany such necessity.\r\n\r\n  I am,\r\n  Very truly,\r\n  Yours, etc.\r\n  WM. P. FRYE.\r\n\r\nLEICESTER, March 13/84.\r\n\r\n_Dear Mr. Hoar:_\r\n\r\nI cannot too much thank you for sending me the memoir--tho'\r\nso brief and exceedingly temperate--of your father.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the few men who kept Massachusetts and New England\r\nfrom rushing down the steep place and perishing in the waters,\r\nas the herd of swine was doing,--a son worthy of the Fathers\r\nof New England.  I think of him as a kind of tall pillar,\r\non a foundation of such granite solidity as to quiet all fears\r\nof possible moving therefrom.  He was an example--and became\r\nby his S. Carolina mission a conspicuous one; by his attitude\r\nand demeanor, opposing the whole moral power of the North\r\nto the despotic and insolent assumptions of Slavery.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n  SAML MAY.\r\n\r\nMy father, in everything that related to his own conduct,\r\nwas controlled by a more than Puritan austerity.  He seemed\r\nto live for nothing but duty.  Yet he was a man of strong\r\naffections, unlike what is generally deemed to be the character\r\nof the Puritan.  He was gentle, tolerant, kindly and affectionate.\r\nHe had all his life a large professional income.  But he never\r\nseemed to care for money.  In that respect he was like one\r\nwho dwelt by the side of a pond, ready to dip up and to give\r\nits waters to any man who might thirst.  He never wasted money,\r\nor spent it for any self-indulgence.  But he was ready to\r\nshare it with any deserving object.  Starr King said of him\r\nthat \"he lived all the beatitudes daily.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hoar was, I suppose, beyond all question, the highest\r\nauthority in New England, indeed in the whole country, on\r\nthe difficult and abstruse questions belonging to the law of\r\nwater privileges and running streams.  He was declared to\r\nbe such by the late Judge Benjamin R. Curtis.  The great Locks\r\nand Canals Company was organized and all the arrangements\r\nfor the ownership, management and control of the water-power\r\nof Lowell were made under his advice and direction.  The same\r\nmethods have been followed in substance at Lawrence and Woonsocket\r\nand other manufacturing places.\r\n\r\nHe preserved his vigor of body until he entered his seventy-\r\nseventh year, taking walks of five or six miles without fatigue.\r\nAbout that time he took a severe cold at a neighbor's funeral.\r\nAn illness followed which seriously impaired his strength.\r\nHe died, November 2, 1856, two days before the Presidential\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nHe was six feet three inches in height, erect, with fine\r\ngray hair, blue eyes, of graceful and dignified deportment,\r\nand of great courtesy, especially to women and children.\r\n\r\nHe held a few simple beliefs with undoubting faith. He submitted\r\nhimself to the rule of life which followed from these, and\r\nrigorously exacted obedience to it from all for whom he was\r\nresponsible.  He accepted the exposition of Christian doctrine\r\ngiven by Dr. Channing.  The Massachusetts Constitution of\r\n1780 seemed to him a nearly perfect system of government.\r\nHe earnestly resisted, in the Convention of 1820, the abolition\r\nof the property qualification for voters, and of the obligation\r\nof all citizens to be taxed for the support of religious worship.\r\nHe took early and deep interest in the temperance reform,\r\nand gave much time, labor, and money to promote it.  \"The\r\nstrength and beauty of the man,\" says Mr. Emerson, \"lay in\r\nthe natural goodness and justice of his mind, which in manhood\r\nand in old age, after dealing all his life with weighty private\r\nand public interests, left an infantile innocence of which\r\nwe have no second or third example,--the strength of a chief\r\nunited to the modesty of a child.  He returned from the courts\r\nand Congresses to sit down with unaltered humility, in the\r\nchurch, or in the town-house, on the plain wooden bench,\r\nwhere Honor came and sat down beside him.  He was a man in\r\nwhom so rare a spirit of justice visibly dwelt, that, if one\r\nhad met him in a cabin or in a court, he must still seem a\r\npublic man answering as a sovereign state to sovereign state;\r\nand might easily suggest Milton's picture of John Bradshaw,\r\n--'that he was a consul from whom the fasces did not depart\r\nwith the year, but in private seemed ever sitting in judgment\r\non kings.'\"\r\n\r\nBut he would have liked better than anything else what was\r\nsaid of him in his official report by the President of the\r\nCollege he loved with that deep affection which her children\r\nfelt for her in his time.  President Walker closes his annual\r\nreport of December 31, 1856, as follows:  \"The undersigned\r\ncould not conclude his report without allusion to the recent\r\nlamented death of the Honorable Samuel Hoar, a distinguished\r\nand justly influential member of this board,--venerable alike\r\nfor his age and his virtues,--a devoted friend of the College\r\nwhich he has been able to serve in a thousand ways by the\r\nwisdom of his counsels and the weight of his character.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hoar was naturally conservative, as would be expected\r\nas an old Federalist who was educated at Harvard in the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century.  His rules of public and private\r\nconduct were strict and austere.  He applied them more strictly\r\nto himself than to others.  His classmates in college used\r\nto call him Cato.  He favored the suppression of the sale\r\nand use of intoxicating liquors, and desired that the whole\r\nforce of the State should be brought to bear to accomplish\r\nthat end.  He was the inveterate foe of oppression, and in\r\nhis later years, opposed every compromise with slavery.  But\r\nhe had no sympathy with reforms which seemed to him to be\r\ndevised merely as political instruments to advance the fortunes\r\nof persons or parties.\r\n\r\nHe had a huge respect for John Quincy Adams, a respect which\r\nI have good reason to know was reciprocated.  But he was by\r\nno means Mr. Adams's blind follower. The ex-President, I think\r\nabout the year 1832, published a pamphlet in which he savagely\r\nattacked the Masonic Order.  He met Mr. Hoar in Boston and\r\nasked him what he thought of it.  Mr. Hoar answered: \"It\r\nseems to me, Mr. Adams, there is but one thing in the world\r\nsillier than Masonry.  That is Anti-Masonry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hoar used to relate with some amusement a dialogue he\r\nhad with a shrewd and witty old lawyer named Josiah Adams,\r\nwho shared the old Federalist dislike of his namesake, John\r\nQuincy Adams.  My father was talking quite earnestly in a\r\ngathering of Middlesex lawyers and said: \"I believe John Quincy\r\nAdams means to be a Christian.\" \"When?\" inquired Josiah.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot draw the portraiture of this noble and stately\r\nfigure.  George Herbert did it perfectly, long ago, in his\r\npoem, \"Constancy.\"\r\n\r\nOld Dr. Lyman Beecher, the foremost champion in his day of\r\nthe old Orthodoxy, spent his life in combating what he deemed\r\nthe pestilent Unitarian heresy.  He was the most famous preacher\r\nin the country.  Mr. Hoar was a pillar of Unitarianism.  Yet\r\nthe Doctor came to know and honor his old antagonist.  He\r\nread in the Boston papers, late Saturday evening, that Mr.\r\nHoar was dying at Concord.  Early Sunday morning before daybreak\r\nhe started, with his son-in-law, Professor Stowe, and drove\r\ntwenty miles to Concord.  He got there just after Mr. Hoar's\r\ndeath.  He asked to go into the chamber where his old friend\r\nlay.  My sister said:  \"Father would have been glad to see\r\nyou, if he were alive.\"  The Doctor gazed a moment, and then\r\nsaid:  \"He's passed safe over, I haven't a doubt of it.  He\r\nwas an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nBOYHOOD IN CONCORD\r\n\r\nI have never got over being a boy.  It does not seem likely\r\nthat I ever shall.  I have to-day, at the age of three score\r\nand sixteen, less sense of my own dignity than I had when\r\nat sixteen I walked for the first time into the College Chapel\r\nat Harvard, clad as the statute required, in a \"black or black-\r\nmixed coat, with buttons of the same color,\" and the admiring\r\nworld, with its eyes on the venerable freshman, seemed to\r\nme to be saying to itself, \"Ecce caudam!\" Behold the tail!\r\n\r\nMost men are apt to exaggerate the merits of their birthplace.\r\nBut I think everybody who knew the town will agree with me\r\nthat there never was in the world a better example of a pure\r\nand beautiful democracy, in the highest sense of the term,\r\nthan the town of Concord from 1826 to the close of the war.\r\nIf there were any aristocracy, it was an aristocracy of personal\r\nworth.  There was little wealth and little poverty.  There\r\nwere no costly dwellings and no hovels.  There was no pride\r\nof wealth or of family.  The richest man in town took an interest\r\nin the affairs of the poorest as in those of a kinsman.  It\r\nnever occurred to the poorest that he must, for that reason,\r\ndoff his hat to any man.\r\n\r\nThe population was permanent, I suppose, as could have been\r\nfound in any spot in Europe.  Ninety-three of the inhabitants\r\nof the town, in 1654, signed a paper pledging their persons\r\nand estates to support the General Court in the contest with\r\nKing Charles II. for the preservation of the Charter.  Fourteen\r\nof their descendants, bearing the same names, were present\r\nat the Centennial Celebration in 1885, dwelling on the land\r\nwhich their ancestors occupied nearly 230 years before.  There\r\nwere 23 others whose descendants of the same name were dwelling\r\nat the time of the Centennial within the original limits of\r\nthe town.  A good many others were represented by female descendants.\r\nSo that at least 50 of the 93 signers of the paper were represented\r\nin the assembly.  A list of the names of the principal inhabitants\r\nof the town to-day would contain the names of a large number\r\nof the principal inhabitants of any generation since its\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThey were of good English stock.  Many of them were of gentle\r\nblood and entitled to bear coat armor at home.  It is interesting\r\nto observe how little the character of the gentleman and gentlewoman\r\nin our New England people is affected by the pursuit, for\r\ngenerations, of humble occupations, which in other countries\r\nare deemed degrading.  Our ancestors, during nearly two centuries\r\nof poverty which followed the first settlement, turned their\r\nhands to the humblest ways of getting a livelihood, became\r\nshoemakers, or blacksmiths or tailors, or did the hardest\r\nand most menial and rudest work of the farm, shoveled gravel\r\nor chopped wood, without any of the effect on their character\r\nwhich would be likely to be felt from the permanent pursuit\r\nof such an occupation in England or Germany.  It was like\r\na fishing party or a hunting party in the woods.  When the\r\nnecessity was over, and the man or the boy in any generation\r\ngot a college education, or was called to take part in public\r\naffairs, he rose at once and easily to the demands of an exalted\r\nstation.  What is true of New England people in this respect\r\nis, I suppose, true of the whole country.\r\n\r\nI wrote, a few years ago, an account of so much of my boyhood\r\nas elapsed before I went to college.  Through the kindness\r\nof the proprietors of _The Youth's Companion,_ I am permitted\r\nto print it here.  I think, on the whole, that is better than\r\nto undertake to tell the story in other phraseology adapted\r\nto maturer readers.  Indeed, I am not sure that the best examples\r\nof good English are not to be found in books written for children.\r\nWhen we have to tell a story to a small boy or girl, we avoid\r\nlittle pomposities, and seek for the plainest, clearest and\r\nmost direct phrase.\r\n\r\nI believe that boys nowadays are more manly and mature than\r\nthey were in my time.  Perhaps this is partly because the\r\nboys show more gravity in my presence, now I am an old man,\r\nthan they did when I was a boy myself.  But in giving an account\r\nof the life of a boy sixty years ago, I must describe it as\r\nI saw it, even if it appear altogether childish and undignified.\r\n\r\nThe life and character of a country are determined in a large\r\ndegree by the sports of its boys.  The Duke of Wellington\r\nused to say that the victory at Waterloo was won on the playing-\r\nfields at Eton.  That is the best people where the boys are\r\nmanly and where the men have a good deal of the boy in them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps all my younger readers do not know how much that makes\r\nup, not only the luxury, but the comfort of life, has first\r\ncome in within the memory of persons now living.  The household\r\nlife of my childhood was not much better in those respects\r\nthan that of a well-to-do Roman or Greek.  It had not improved\r\na great deal for two thousand years.  There were no house-\r\nwarming furnaces, and stoves were almost unknown.  There were\r\nno double windows, and the houses were warmed by open fires.\r\nThere were no matches.\r\n\r\nThere were no water-pipes in the houses, and no provision\r\nwas made for discharging sewage.  There were no railroads,\r\ntelegraphs or telephones.  Letter postage to New York from\r\nBoston was twenty-five cents.  None of the modern agricultural\r\nmachinery then existed, not even good modern plows.  Crops\r\nwere planted by hand and cultivated with the hoe and spade.\r\nVegetables were dug with the hoe, and hay and grain cut with\r\nthe sickle or scythe.  There were no ice-houses.  The use\r\nof ice for keeping provisions or cooling water was unknown.\r\n\r\nMy father was well-to-do, and his household lived certainly\r\nas well as any family in the town of Concord, where I was\r\nborn.  I have no doubt a Roman boy two hundred years before\r\nChrist, or an Athenian boy four hundred years before Christ,\r\nlived quite as well as I did, if not better.\r\n\r\nThe boy got up in the morning and dressed himself in a room\r\ninto which the cold air came through the cracks in the window.\r\nIf the temperature were twenty degrees below zero outside,\r\nit was very little higher inside.  If he were big enough to\r\nmake the fires, he made his way down-stairs in the dark of\r\na winter morning and found, if the fire had been properly raked\r\nup the night before, a few coals in the ashes in the kitchen\r\nfireplace.  The last person who went to bed the night before\r\nhad done exactly what Homer describes as the practice in Ulysses's\r\ntime, when he tells us that Ulysses covered himself with leaves\r\nafter he was washed ashore in Phaiakia:\r\n\r\n\"He lay down in the midst, heaping the fallen leaves above,\r\nas a man hides a brand in a dark bed of ashes, at some outlying\r\nfarm where neighbors are not near, hoarding a seed of fire\r\nto save his seeking elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nBut first he must get a light.  Matches are not yet invented.\r\nSo he takes from the shelf over the mantelpiece an old tin\r\nor brass candlestick with a piece of tallow candle in it,\r\nand with the tongs takes a coal from the ashes, and holds\r\nthe candle wick against the coal and gives a few puffs with\r\nhis breath.  If he have good luck, he lights the wick, probably\r\nafter many failures.\r\n\r\nMy mother had a very entertaining story connected with the\r\nold-fashioned way of getting a light.  Old Jeremiah Mason,\r\nwho was probably the greatest lawyer we ever had in New England,\r\nunless we except Daniel Webster, studied law in my uncle's\r\noffice and shared a room in his house with another law student.\r\nOne April Fool's day the two young gentlemen went out late\r\nin the afternoon, and my aunt, a young unmarried girl who\r\nlived with her sister, and another girl, went into the room\r\nand took the old half-burnt candle out of the candlestick,\r\ncut a piece of turnip to resemble it, cut out a little piece\r\nlike a wick at the end, blackened it with ink, and put it\r\nin the candlestick.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Mason came in in the dark, he took a coal up with\r\nthe tongs and put it against the wick, and puffed and puffed,\r\nuntil after a long and vexatious trial he discovered what\r\nwas the matter.  He said nothing but waited for his chum to\r\ncome in, who went through the same trial.  When they discovered\r\nthe hoax they framed an elaborate complaint in legal jargon\r\nagainst the two roguish girls, and brought them to trial before\r\na young lawyer of their acquaintance.  The young ladies were\r\nfound guilty and sentenced to pay as a fine a bowl of eggnog.\r\n\r\nAfter getting his candle lighted, the boy takes dry kindling,\r\nwhich has been gathered the night before, and starts a fire.\r\nThe next thing is to get some water.  He is lucky if the water\r\nin the old cast-iron kettle which hangs on the crane in the\r\nfireplace be not frozen.  As soon as the fire is started he\r\ngoes outdoors to thaw out the pump, if they have a wooden\r\npump.  But that is all frozen up, and he has to get some hot\r\nwater from this kettle to pour down over the piston till he\r\ncan thaw it out.  Sometimes he would have an old-fashioned\r\nwell, sunk too low in the ground for the frost to reach it,\r\nand could get water with the old oaken bucket.\r\n\r\nHe brings in from out-of-doors a pail or two of water.  If\r\nthere has been a snow-storm the night before he has to shovel\r\na path to the wood-shed, where he can get the day's supply\r\nof wood from outside, and then from the doors of the house\r\nout to the street.  Meantime the woman whose duty it is to\r\nget breakfast makes her appearance.\r\n\r\nThe wooden pump, which took the place of the old well in many\r\ndooryards, was considered a great invention.  We all looked\r\nwith huge respect upon Sanford Adams of Concord, who invented\r\nit, and was known all over the country.\r\n\r\nHe was quite original in his way.  The story used to be told\r\nof him that he called at my father's house one day to get\r\nsome advice as to a matter of law.  Father was at dinner\r\nand went to the door himself.  Mr. Adams stated his case in\r\na word or two as he stood on the door-step, to which father\r\ngave him his answer, the whole conversation not lasting more\r\nthan two minutes.\r\n\r\nHe asked Mr. Hoar what he should pay, and father said, \"Five\r\ndollars.\"  Mr. Adams paid it at once, and father said, \"By\r\nthe way, there is a little trouble with my pump.  It does\r\nnot draw.  Will you just look at it?\"  So Mr. Adams went\r\naround the corner of the shed, moved the handle of the pump,\r\nand put his hand down and fixed a little spigot which was\r\nin the side, which had got loose, and the pump worked perfectly.\r\nFather said, \"Thank you, sir.\" To which Adams replied: \"It\r\nwill be five dollars, Mr. Hoar,\" and father gave him back\r\nthe same bill he had just taken.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the sympathy of the people who told the story\r\nwas with the pump-maker and not with the lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe great kitchen fireplace presented a very cheerful appearance\r\ncompared with the black range or stove of to-day.  It was\r\nfrom six to eight or ten feet wide, with a great chimney.\r\nIn many houses you could stand on the hearth and look up the\r\nchimney and see the stars on a winter night.  Across the fireplace\r\nhung an iron crane, which swung on a hinge or pivot, from\r\nwhich hung a large number of what were called pothooks and\r\ntrammels.  From these were suspended the great kettles and\r\nlittle kettles and the griddles and pots and boilers for the\r\ncooking processes.\r\n\r\nThe roasting was done in a big \"tin kitchen,\" which stood\r\nbefore the fire, in which meats or poultry were held by a\r\nlarge iron spit, which pierced them and which could be revolved\r\nto present one side after the other to the blaze.  Sometimes\r\nthere was a little clockwork which turned the spit automatically,\r\nbut usually it was turned round from time to time by the cook.\r\nAs you know, they used to have in England little dogs called\r\nturnspits, trained to turn a wheel for this purpose.  A little\r\ndoor in the rear of this tin kitchen gave access for basting\r\nthe meat.  In the large trough at the bottom the gravy was\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nNo boy of that day will think there is any flavor like that\r\nof roast turkey and chicken or of the doughnuts and pancakes\r\nor griddle-cakes which were cooked by these open fires.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the fireplace, with a flue entering the chimney,\r\nwas a great brick oven, big enough to bake all the bread\r\nneeded by a large family for a week or ten days.  The oven\r\nwas heated by a brisk fire made of birch or maple or some\r\nvery rapidly burning wood.  When the coals were taken out,\r\nthe bread was put in, and the oven was shut with two iron\r\ndoors.  The baking-day was commonly Saturday.\r\n\r\nWhen the bread was taken out Saturday afternoon it was usual\r\nto put in a large pot of beans for the Sunday dinner.  They\r\nwere left there all night and the oven was opened in the morning\r\nand enough came out for breakfast, when there was put into\r\nthe oven a pot of Indian pudding, which was left with the\r\nrest of the beans for the Sunday dinner.\r\n\r\nThe parlor fire was a very beautiful sight, with the big\r\nlogs and the sparkling walnut or oak wood blazing up.  Some\r\nof the housekeepers of that time had a good deal of skill\r\nin arranging the wood in a fireplace so as to make of it\r\na beautiful piece of architecture.  Lowell describes these\r\nold fires very well in his ballad, \"The Courtin'\":\r\n\r\n  A fireplace filled the room's one side\r\n  With half a cord o'wood in--\r\n  There warn't no stoves (till comfort died)\r\n  To bake ye to a puddin'.\r\n\r\n  The wannut logs shot sparkles out\r\n  Towards the pootiest, bless her!\r\n  An' leetle flames danced all about\r\n  The chiny on the dresser.\r\n\r\n  Agin' the chimbley crooknecks hung,\r\n  An' in amongst 'em rusted\r\n  The old queen's arm thet Gran'ther Young\r\n  Fetched back from Concord busted.\r\n\r\nWe did not have fireplaces quite as large as this in my father's\r\nhouse, although they were common in the farmers' houses round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nIn the coldest weather the heat did not come out a great\r\nway from the hearth, and the whole family gathered close\r\nabout the fire to keep warm.  It was regarded as a great\r\nbreach of good manners to go between any person and the fire.\r\nThe fireplace was the centre of the household, and was regarded\r\nas the type and symbol of the home.  The boys all understood\r\nthe force of the line:\r\n\r\n  Strike for your altars and your fires!\r\n\r\nI wonder if any of my readers nowadays would be stirred by\r\nan appeal to strike for his furnace or his air-tight stove.\r\n\r\nSunday was kept with Jewish strictness.  The boys were not\r\nallowed to go out-of-doors except to church.  They could\r\nnot play at any game or talk about matters not pertaining\r\nto religion.  They were not permitted to read any books except\r\nsuch as were \"good for Sunday.\"  There were very few religious\r\nstory-books in those days, and what we had were of a dreary\r\nkind; so the boy's time hung heavy on his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Pilgrim's Progress,\" with its rude prints, was, however,\r\na great resource.  We conned it over and over again, and knew\r\nit by heart.  An elder brother of mine who was very precocious\r\nwas extremely fond of it, especially of the picture of the\r\nfight between Apollyon and Christian, where the fiend with\r\nhis head covered with stiff, sharp bristles \"straddled clear\r\nacross the road,\" to stop Christian in his way.  Old Dr. Lyman\r\nBeecher, who had his stiff gray hair cropped short all over\r\nhis head, made a call at our house one afternoon.  While he\r\nwas waiting for my mother to come down, the little fellow\r\ncame into the room and took a look up at the doctor, and then\r\ntrotted round to the other side and looked up at him again.\r\nHe said, \"I think, sir, you look like Apollyon.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was infinitely amused at being compared to the\r\npersonage of whom, in his own opinion and that of a good many\r\nother good people, he was then the most distinguished living\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nThe church was an old-fashioned wooden building, painted yellow,\r\nof Dutch architecture, with galleries on three sides, and\r\non the fourth a pulpit with a great sounding-board over it,\r\ninto which the minister got by quite a high flight of stairs.\r\nJust below the pulpit was the deacons' seat, where the four\r\ndeacons sat in a row.  The pews were old-fashioned square,\r\nhigh pews, reaching up almost to the top of the head of a\r\nboy ten years old when he was standing up.\r\n\r\nThe seats were without cushions and with hinges.  When the\r\npeople stood up for prayer the seats were turned up for greater\r\nconvenience of standing, and when the prayer ended they came\r\ndown all over the church with a slam, like a small cannonade.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, in the middle of the sermon, the old minister,\r\nDoctor Ripley, stood up in the pulpit and said in a loud\r\nvoice, \"Simeon, come here.  Take your hat and come here.\"\r\nSimeon was a small boy who lived in the doctor's family and\r\nsat in the gallery.  We boys all supposed that Simeon had\r\nbeen playing in church, or had committed some terrible offence\r\nfor which he was to be punished in sight of the whole congregation.\r\n\r\nSimeon came down trembling and abashed, and the doctor told\r\nhim to go home as fast as he could and get the Thanksgiving\r\nProclamation.  The doctor filled up the time as well he could\r\nwith an enormously long prayer, until the boy got back.  Simeon\r\nconfessed to some of the boys that he had been engaged in\r\nsome mischief just before he was called, and he was terribly\r\nafraid the doctor had caught him.\r\n\r\nThis old church with its tower, yellow spire, old clock and\r\nweathercock, seems to me as I look back on it to have been\r\na very attractive piece of architecture.  It was that church\r\nwhich suggested to Emerson the leading thought in one of\r\nhis most famous poems, \"The Problem.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days, when people were to be married the law required\r\nnotice to be given of their intention by proclaiming it aloud\r\nin the church three Sundays in succession.  So just before\r\nthe service began, the old town clerk would get up and proclaim:\r\n\"There is a marriage intended between Mr. John Brown of this\r\ntown and Miss Sarah Smith of Sudbury,\" and there was great\r\ncuriosity in the congregation to hear the announcement.  The\r\ntown clerk in my boyhood had been a wealthy old bachelor for\r\nwhom the young ladies had set their caps in vain for two generations.\r\nOne day he astonished the congregation by proclaiming: \"There\r\nis a marriage intended between Dr. Abiel Keywood\"--which\r\nwas his own name--\"and Miss Lucy P. Fay, both of Concord.\"\r\nThat was before I can remember, as his boys were about my\r\nage.\r\n\r\nDoctor Ripley, the minister in Concord, was an old man who\r\nhad been settled there during the Revolutionary War and was\r\nover the parish sixty-two years.  He was an excellent preacher\r\nand scholar, and his kindly despotism was submitted to by\r\nthe whole town.  His way of pronouncing would sound very queer\r\nnow, though it was common then.  I well remember his reading\r\nthe lines of the hymn--\r\n\r\n  Let every critter jine\r\n  To praise the eternal God.\r\n\r\nScattered about the church were the good gray heads of many\r\nsurvivors of the Revolution--the men who had been at the bridge\r\non the 19th of April, and who made the first armed resistance\r\nto the British power.  They were very striking and venerable\r\nfigures, with their queues and knee-breeches and shoes with\r\nshining buckles.  Men were more particular about their apparel\r\nin those days than we are now.  They had great stateliness\r\nof behavior, and admitted of little familiarity.\r\n\r\nThey had heard John Buttrick's order to fire, which marked\r\nthe moment when our country was born.  The order was given\r\nto British subjects.  It was obeyed by American citizens.\r\nAmong them was old Master Blood, who saw a ball strike the\r\nwater when the British fired their first volley.  I heard\r\nmany of the old men tell their stories of the Battle of Concord,\r\nand of the capture of Burgoyne.\r\n\r\nI lay down on the grass one summer afternoon, when old Amos\r\nBaker of Lincoln, who was in the Lincoln Company on the 19th\r\nof April, told me the whole story.  He was very indignant\r\nat the claim that the Acton men marched first to attack the\r\nBritish because the others hesitated.  He said, \"It was because\r\nthey had bagnets [bayonets].  The rest of us hadn't no bagnets.\"\r\n\r\nOne day a few years later, when I was in college, I walked\r\nup from Cambridge to Concord, through Lexington, and had a\r\nchat with old Jonathan Harrington by the roadside.  He told\r\nme he was on the Common when the British Regulars fired upon\r\nthe Lexington men.  He did not tell me then the story which\r\nhe told afterward at the great celebration at Concord in 1850.\r\nHe and Amos Baker were the only survivors who were there that\r\nday.  He said he was a boy about fifteen years old on April\r\n19, 1775.  He was a fifer in the company.  He had been up\r\nthe greater part of the night helping get the stores out of\r\nthe way of the British, who were expected, and went to bed\r\nabout three o'clock, very tired and sleepy.  His mother came\r\nand pounded with her fist on the door of his chamber, and\r\nsaid, \"Git up, Jonathan! The Reg'lars are comin' and somethin'\r\nmust be done!\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Briggs repeated this anecdote in the old man's presence\r\nat the Concord celebration in 1850.  Charles Storey, a noted\r\nwit, father of the eminent lawyer, Moorfield Storey, sent\r\nup to the chair this toast:  \"When Jonathan Harrington got\r\nup in the morning on April 19, 1775, a near relative and namesake\r\nof his got up about the same time: Brother Jonathan.  But\r\nhis mother didn't call him.\"\r\n\r\nA very curious and amusing incident is said, and I have no\r\ndoubt truly, to have happened at this celebration.  It shows\r\nhow carefully the great orator, Edward Everett, looked out\r\nfor the striking effects in his speech.  He turned in the\r\nmidst of his speech to the seat where Amos Baker and Jonathan\r\nHarrington sat, and addressed them.  At once they both stood\r\nup, and Mr. Everett said, with fine dramatic effect, \"Sit,\r\nvenerable friends.  It is for us to stand in your presence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the proceedings were over, old Amos Baker was heard\r\nto say to somebody, \"What do you suppose Squire Everett meant?\r\nHe came to us before his speech and told us to stand up when\r\nhe spoke to us, and when we stood up he told us to sit down.\"\r\n\r\nSo you will understand how few lives separate you from the\r\ntime when our country was born, and the time when all our\r\npeople were British subjects.\r\n\r\nBut to come back to our old meeting-house.  The windows rattled\r\nin the winter, and the cold wind came in through the cracks.\r\nThere was a stove which was rather a modern innovation; but\r\nit did little to temper the coldness of a day in midwinter.\r\nWe used to carry to church a little foot-stove with a little\r\ntin pan in it, which we filled with coal from the stove in\r\nthe meeting-house, and the ladies of the family would pass\r\nit round to each other to keep their toes from freezing; but\r\nthe boys did not get much benefit from it.\r\n\r\nThey had good schools in Concord, and the boys generally\r\nwere good scholars and read good books.  So whenever they\r\nthought fit they could use as good language as anybody; but\r\ntheir speech with one another was in the racy, pithy Yankee\r\ndialect, which Lowell has made immortal in the \"Biglow Papers.\"\r\nIt was not always grammatical, but as well adapted for conveying\r\nwit and humor and shrewd sense as the Scotch of Burns.\r\n\r\nThe boys knew very well how to take the conceit or vanity\r\nout of their comrades.  In the summer days all the boys of\r\nthe village used to gather at a place on the river, known as\r\nThayer's swimming-place, about half a mile from the town\r\npump, which was the centre from which all distances were\r\nmeasured in those days.  There was a little gravel beach\r\nwhere you could wade out a rod or two, and then for a rod\r\nor two the water was over the boy's head.  It then became\r\nshallow again near the opposite bank.  So it was a capital\r\nplace to learn to swim.\r\n\r\nAfter they came out, the boys would sit down on the bank\r\nand have a sort of boys' exchange, in which all matters of\r\ninterest were talked over, and a great deal of good-natured\r\nchaff was exchanged.  Any newcomer had to pass through an\r\nordeal of this character, in which his temper and quality\r\nwere thoroughly tried.  I remember now an occasion which\r\nmust have happened when I was not more than eight or ten\r\nyears old, when a rather awkward-looking greenhorn had come\r\ndown from New Hampshire and made his appearance at the swimming-\r\nplace.  The boys, one after another, tried him by putting\r\nmocking questions or attempting to humbug him with some large\r\nstory.  He received it all with patience and good nature until\r\none remark seemed to sting him from his propriety.  He turned\r\nwith great dignity upon the offender, and said, \"Was that\r\nyou that spoke, or was it a punkin busted?\"  We all thought\r\nthat it was well said, and took him into high favor.\r\n\r\nI suppose the outdoor winter sports have not changed much\r\nsince my childhood.  The sluggish Concord River used to overflow\r\nits banks and cover the broad meadows for miles, where we\r\nfound excellent skating, and where the water would be only\r\na foot or two in depth.  The boys could skate for ten miles\r\nto Billerica and ten miles back, hardly going over deep water,\r\nexcept at the bridges, the whole way.\r\n\r\nSleigh-riding was not then what it is now.  There were a\r\nfew large sleighs owned in the town which would hold thirty\r\nor forty persons, and once or twice in the winter the boys\r\nand girls would take a ride to some neighboring town when\r\nthe sleighing was good.\r\n\r\nThe indoor games were marbles, checkers, backgammon, dominoes,\r\nhunt-the-slipper, blind-man's-buff, and in some houses, where\r\nthey were not too strict, they played cards.  High-low-jack,\r\nsometimes called all-fours or seven-up, everlasting and old\r\nmaid were the chief games of cards.  Most of these games have\r\ncome down from a very early antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe summer outdoor games were mumble-the-peg, high-spy, snap-\r\nthe-whip, a rather dangerous performance, in which a long\r\nrow of boys, with the biggest boy at one end, and tapering\r\ndown to the smallest at the other end, would run over a field\r\nor open space until suddenly the big boy would stop, turn\r\nhalf around, and stand still and hold fast with all his might.\r\nThe result was that the boy next to him had to move a very\r\nlittle distance, but the little fellow at the end was compelled\r\nto describe a half-circle with great rapidity, and was sometimes\r\nhurled across the field, and brought up with a heavy fall.\r\nThere were thread-the-needle, hunt-the-red-lion and football,\r\nplayed very much as it is now, except with less system and\r\ndiscipline, and various games of ball.  These games of ball\r\nwere much less scientific and difficult than the modern games.\r\nChief were four-old-cat, three-old-cat, two-old-cat and base.\r\n\r\nWe had fewer studies at our school than now.  The boy who\r\ndid not go to college learned to read and write, perhaps\r\nan elementary history of the United States, and arithmetic,\r\nand occasionally made some little progress in algebra.  On\r\nSaturdays we used to \"speak pieces.\"  Our favorites were\r\nsome spirited lyric, like \"Scots Wha Hae\" or Pierpont's \"Stand,\r\nthe ground's your own, my braves,\" \"The boy stood on the burning\r\ndeck,\" and \"Bernardo del Carpio.\"  Sometimes, though not often,\r\nsome comic piece was chosen, like Jack Downing's \"Tax on Old\r\nBachelors.\"\r\n\r\nThose who fitted for college added Latin and Greek to these\r\nstudies.  The children were sent to school earlier than is\r\nthe present fashion, and had long school hours and few vacations.\r\nThere were four vacations in the year, of a week each, and\r\nthree days at Thanksgiving time.  Little account was made\r\nof Christmas.  The fashion of Christmas presents was almost\r\nwholly unknown.  The boys used to be allowed to go out of\r\nschool to study in the warm summer days, and would find some\r\nplace in a field, and sometimes up in the belfry of the little\r\nschoolhouse.  I remember studying Caesar there with George\r\nBrooks, afterward judge, and reading with him an account of\r\nsome battle where Caesar barely escaped being killed, on which\r\nBrooks's comment was \"I wish to thunder he had been!\"\r\n\r\nI am afraid the boys did not respect the property of the\r\nowners of the neighboring apple orchards, as undoubtedly\r\nthe better-trained boys of modern times do now.  We understood\r\nthe law to be that all apples that grew on the branches extending\r\nover the highway were public property, and I am afraid that\r\nwhen the owner was not about we were not very particular as\r\nto the boundary line.  This seems to have been a trait of\r\nboy nature for generations.  You know Sidney Smith's account\r\nof the habit of boys at his school to rob a neighboring orchard,\r\nuntil the farmer bought a large, savage bulldog for his protection.\r\nSome of the big boys told Sidney that if a boy would get down\r\non his hands and knees and go backward toward the dog the\r\ndog would be frightened, and he could get the apples.  He\r\ntried the experiment unsuccessfully, and with the result that\r\nconcluded, as he says, that \"it makes no difference to a bulldog\r\nwhich end of a boy he gets hold of, if he only gets a good\r\nhold.\"\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the schoolmaster in those days was pretty\r\nsevere.  For slight offences the boys were deprived of their\r\nrecess or compelled to study for an hour after the school\r\nwas dismissed.  The chief weapon of torture was the ferule,\r\nto the efficacy of which I can testify from much personal\r\nknowledge.  The master had in his desk, however, a cowhide\r\nfor gross cases.  I do not remember knowing how that felt\r\nfrom personal experience, but I remember very well seeing\r\nit applied occasionally to the big boys.\r\n\r\nIn the infant schools, which were kept by women, of course\r\nthe discipline was not expected to be so severe.  The schoolmistress\r\nin those days wore what was called a busk--a flat piece of\r\nlancewood, hornbeam, or some other like tough and elastic\r\nwood, thrust into a sort of pocket or sheath in her dress,\r\nwhich came up almost to the chin and came down below the waist.\r\nThis was intended to preserve the straightness and grace of\r\nher figure.  When the small boy misbehaved, the schoolma'am\r\nwould unsheath this weapon, and for some time thereafter the\r\nculprit found sitting down exceedingly uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSometimes the sole of the schoolmistress's slipper answered\r\nthe same purpose, and sometimes a stick from some neighboring\r\nbirch-tree.  It all came to pretty much the same thing in\r\nthe end.  The schoolmistress knew well how to accomplish her\r\npurpose.  There was a diversity of gifts but the same spirit.\r\n\r\nWe were put to school much earlier than children are now\r\nand were more advanced in our studies on the whole.  I began\r\nto study Latin on my sixth birthday.  When I was nine years\r\nold I was studying Greek, and had read several books of Virgil.\r\nWe were not very thorough Latin scholars, even when we entered\r\ncollege, but could translate Virgil and Cicero and Caesar\r\nand easy Greek like Xenophon.\r\n\r\nThe boys occasionally formed military companies and played\r\nsoldier, but these did not, so far as I remember, last very\r\nlong.  There was also a company of Indians, who dressed in\r\nlong white shirts, with pieces of red flannel sewn on them.\r\nThey had wooden spears.  That was more successful, and lasted\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nThey were exceedingly fond of seeing the real soldiers.  There\r\nwere two full companies in Concord, the artillery and the\r\nlight infantry.  The artillery had two cannon captured from\r\nthe British, which had been presented to the company by the\r\nlegislature in honor of April 19, 1775.  When these two companies\r\nparaded, they were followed by an admiring train of small\r\nboys all day long, if the boys could get out of school.  I\r\nremember on one occasion there was a great rivalry between\r\nthe companies, and one of them got the famous Brigade Band\r\nfrom Boston, and the other an equally famous band, called\r\nthe Boston Brass Band, in which Edward Kendall, the great\r\nmusician, was the player on the bugle.  A very great day indeed\r\nwas the muster-day, when sometimes an entire brigade would\r\nbe called out for drill.  These muster-days happened three\r\nor four times in my boyhood in Concord.\r\n\r\nBut the great day of all was what was called \"Cornwallis,\"\r\nwhich was the anniversary of the capture of Cornwallis at\r\nYorktown.  There were organized companies in uniform representing\r\nthe British army and an equally large number of volunteers,\r\ngenerally in old-fashioned dress, and with such muskets and\r\nother accoutrements as they could pick up, who represented\r\nthe American army.  There was a parade and a sham fight which\r\nended as all such fights, whether sham or real, should end,\r\nin a victory for the Americans, and Cornwallis and his troops\r\nwere paraded, captive and ignominious.  I quite agree with\r\nHosea Biglow when he says, \"There is a fun to a Cornwallis,\r\nthough; I aint agoin' to deny it.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys cared little for politics, though they used to profess\r\nthe faith of their fathers; but every boy sometimes imagined\r\nhimself a soldier, and his highest conception of glory was\r\nto \"lick the British.\"  I remember walking home from school\r\nwith a squad of little fellows at the time Andrew Jackson\r\nissued his famous message, when he threatened war if the French\r\ndid not pay us our debt.  We discussed the situation with\r\ngreat gravity, and concluded that if the French beat us, we\r\nshould have a king to rule over us.\r\n\r\nBesides the two military companies, there was another called\r\nthe \"Old Shad.\"  The law required every able-bodied man of\r\nmilitary age to turn out for military training and inspection\r\non the last Wednesday in May; they turned out just to save\r\nthe penalty of the law, and used to dress in old clothes,\r\nand their awkward evolutions were the object of great scorn\r\nto the small boy of the time.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Concord were made lively by the stage-coaches\r\nand numerous teams.  There were four taverns in the town,\r\nall well patronized, with numerous sleeping-rooms.  Two of\r\nthem had large halls for dancing.  A great many balls were\r\ngiven, to which persons came from the neighboring towns.\r\n\r\nThere was an excellent fiddler named John Wesson, who continued\r\nto give the benefit of his talent to all parties, public and\r\nprivate, down to the time of the war, when he said he would\r\nnot play a dancing tune till the boys came home.  He died\r\nsoon after, and I do not know whether his music was ever heard\r\nagain.  These taverns were crowded with guests.  One principal\r\nroute for stages and teams to New Hampshire, Vermont and Canada\r\npassed through Concord.\r\n\r\nThere were several lines of stages, one from Lowell to Framingham,\r\nand two at least from Boston.  The number of passengers, which\r\nnow are all carried by rail, was so large that extras were\r\nfrequently necessary.  The teams were very often more than\r\nthe barns of the taverns in the town could accommodate, and\r\non summer nights the wagons would extend for long distances\r\nalong the village street with horses tied behind them.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the toddy stick was hardly interrupted in the\r\nbarroom inside from morning till night.  The temperance reform\r\nhad not made great headway in my youthful days.  It was not\r\nuncommon to see farmers, bearing names highly respected in\r\nthe town, lying drunk by the roadside on a summer afternoon,\r\nor staggering along the streets.  The unpainted farmhouses\r\nand barns had their broken windows stuffed with old hats or\r\ngarments.  I have heard Nathan Brooks, who delivered the first\r\ntemperance lecture in the town, at the request of the selectmen,\r\nsay that after it was over he and the selectmen and some of\r\nthe principal citizens went over to the tavern, and each took\r\na mug of flip.\r\n\r\nThere were great quantities of huckleberries in the pastures\r\nabout Concord, and the sweet high blackberries abounded by\r\nthe roadside.  There were plenty of chestnuts in the woods,\r\nand the walnut, or pig-nut, also abounded; so that berrying\r\nand nutting were favorite pastimes.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a small boy a party of us went down to Walden woods,\r\nafterward so famous as the residence of Henry Thoreau.  There\r\nwas an old fellow named Tommy Wyman, who lived in a hut near\r\nthe pond, who did not like the idea of having the huckleberry-\r\nfields near him invaded by the boys.  He told us it was not\r\nsafe for us to go there.  He said there was an Indian doctor\r\nin the woods who caught small boys and cut out their livers\r\nto make medicine.  We were terribly frightened, and all went\r\nhome in a hurry.\r\n\r\nWhen we got near the town, we met old John Thoreau, with his\r\nson Henry, and I remember his amusement when I told him the\r\nstory.  He said, \"If I meet him, I will run this key down\r\nhis throat,\" producing a key from his pocket.  We reported\r\nthe occurrence at the village store, but were unable to excite\r\nany interest in the subject.\r\n\r\nThanksgiving was then, as it is and ought to be now, the\r\ngreat day of the year.  All the children were at home.  The\r\nambition of the head of the house was to get the largest\r\nturkey that money could buy.  No Thanksgiving dinner was\r\nquite complete unless there were a baby on hand belonging\r\nto some branch of the family, no bigger than the turkey.\r\nThe preparation for Thanksgiving was very interesting to\r\nthe small boy mind.  A boiled or roasted turkey, a pair of\r\nchickens, chicken pie, wonderful cranberry sauce, a plum\r\npudding, and all manner of apple pies, mince pies, squash\r\npies, pumpkin pies, and nuts, raisins, figs and noble apples\r\nmade part of the feast.  I suppose Thanksgiving customs have\r\nchanged less than most others, except in one particular.\r\nI do not believe there is a small boy's stomach in this generation\r\nthat can hold a tenth part of what used to go into mine, not\r\nonly on Thanksgiving day, but on the days before and after.\r\nThe raisins were to be picked over, the nuts and citron got\r\nready, when Thanksgiving was coming on, of all which we took\r\nabundant tolls.  The cold and warmed-over dishes lasted through\r\nthe rest of the week.  I do not know what the Jewish festival\r\nor the old Roman banquets might have been, but they could\r\nnot have equalled a New England Thanksgiving week in a house\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nThe doctor in those days was a terror to the small boy.  The\r\nhorrible and nasty castor oil, ipecac and calomel, and the\r\nsalts and senna, sulphur and molasses taken three mornings\r\nin succession and then missed three mornings, were worse than\r\nany sickness.  Of the last I speak only from hearsay, not\r\nfrom personal knowledge.  Then the cupping and bleeding were\r\nfearful things to go through or look upon.  We had none of\r\nthe sweet patent medicines that the children now cry for,\r\nand none of the smooth capsules or the pleasant comfits that\r\nturn medicine into confectionery nowadays.\r\n\r\nThe boys were not allowed in most families to read novels,\r\neven on week-days.  My father had a great dislike of fiction\r\nof all sorts, and for a good while would not tolerate any\r\nnovels in the house; but one winter day he went to Pepperell,\r\nin the northern part of the county, to try a case before a\r\nsheriff's jury.  About the time the case got through there\r\ncame up a sudden and violent snowstorm, which blocked up the\r\nroad with deep drifts so that he could not get home for two\r\nor three days.  He had to stay at a small country tavern,\r\nand the time hung very heavily on his hands.\r\n\r\nHe asked the landlord if he had any books.  The only one\r\nhe could find was a first volume of Scott's \"Redgauntlet,\"\r\nwhich was just then being published in Boston by a bookseller\r\nnamed Parker, in what was called Parker's revised edition.\r\nFather read it with infinite delight.  His eyes were opened\r\nto the excellence of Scott.  He got home the next day at\r\nabout noon, and immediately sent one of the children down\r\nto the circulating library to get the second volume.  He\r\nsubscribed to Parker's edition, and was a great lover of Scott\r\never after.\r\n\r\nWe were permitted, however, to read the \"Tales of a Grandfather.\"\r\nI hope if any boy reads this book he will read the \"Tales\r\nof a Grandfather,\" especially the parts which give the history\r\nof Scotland.  It is a most interesting and noble story.  I\r\ncan remember now how the tears ran down my cheeks as I read\r\nScott's description of finding the bones of Robert Bruce in\r\nthe old abbey at Dunfermline:\r\n\r\n\"As the church would not hold half the numbers, the people\r\nwere allowed to pass through it one after another, that each\r\none, the poorest as well as the richest, might see all that\r\nremained of the great king, Robert Bruce.  Many people shed\r\ntears; for there was the wasted skull which once was the head,\r\nthat thought so wisely and boldly for his country's deliverance;\r\nand there was the dry bone which had once been the sturdy\r\narm that killed Sir Henry de Bohun, between the two armies,\r\nat a single blow on the evening before the Battle of Bannockburn.\"\r\n\r\nI account it one of the chief blessings of my life that my\r\nboyhood was spent in the pure, noble and simple society of\r\nthe people of Concord.  I am afraid I did not do it much\r\ncredit then.  Old Dr. Bartlett, one of the worthiest and\r\nkindliest of men, but who always uttered what was in his\r\nheart, said after my two oldest brothers and I had grown\r\nup, that Samuel Hoar's boys used to be the three biggest\r\nrascals in Concord, but they all seemed to have turned out\r\npretty well.  I have so far kept this statement strictly from\r\nthe knowledge of the Democratic papers.  But I suppose it\r\nis too late to do any harm now.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nFAMOUS CONCORD MEN\r\n\r\nThere were in Concord in my boyhood three writers who afterward\r\nbecame very famous indeed--Emerson, Hawthorne and Thoreau.\r\nMr. Lowell said that these three names shine among all others\r\nin American literature as the three blazing stars in the belt\r\nof Orion shine in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe town is represented in the beautiful building of the\r\nCongressional Library at Washington by busts of Emerson and\r\nHawthorne on the outside front of the building; by Emerson's\r\nname on the mosaic ceiling in the entrance pavilion, and by\r\nthree sentences from his writings inscribed on the walls.\r\nThere are two out of eight such busts.  It is also represented\r\nby two figures, a symbolic Statue of History, and a bronze\r\nStatue of Herodotus, both by Daniel Chester French, the sculptor,\r\na Concord man.\r\n\r\nEmerson came to live in Concord in the summer of 1835.  Although\r\nhe was born in Boston and went to school there, he belonged\r\nto the town by virtue of his descent from a race of Concord\r\nministers who held the pulpit, with very brief intervals,\r\nfrom 1635 to 1841.  But I do not think his influence upon\r\nthe town was very great for the first fifteen or twenty years\r\nof his life there.  Indeed, I think he would have said that\r\nthe town had more influence upon him than he had upon it.\r\nThe Concord people, like the general public, were slow in\r\ncoming to know his great genius.  He was highly respected\r\nalways.  But the people were at first puzzled by him.  His\r\nlife was somewhat secluded.  He spent his days in study and\r\nin solitary walks.  Until Mrs. Ripley came to the old manse,\r\nabout 1846, Emerson had, I think, no intimate friend outside\r\nof his own household, except my sister Elizabeth, who had\r\nbeen betrothed to his brother Charles, and was as a sister\r\nto Emerson until her death in 1878.  A good many allusions\r\nto her will be found in his life and in his letters to Carlyle.\r\nAfter she died and shortly before his own death he appeared\r\nat my brother's house one day with a manuscript which he had\r\nhanded to the Judge.  He had gone over his diary for a great\r\nmany years and extracted and copied everything in it which\r\nrelated to her.\r\n\r\nHe used to read lectures to the Lyceum, and in reading his\r\nbooks now I find a great many passages which I remember to\r\nhave heard him read in my youthful days.  In one of his lectures\r\nupon Plato, he said that he turned everything to the use of\r\nhis philosophy, that \"wife, children and friends were all\r\nground into paint\"--alluding to Washington Allston's story\r\nof the Paint King who married a lovely maiden that he might\r\nmake paint of the beautiful color of her cheeks.\r\n\r\nA worthy farmer's wife in the audience took this literally,\r\nand left the room in high dudgeon.  She said she thought\r\nWaldo Emerson might be in better business than holding up\r\nto the people of Concord the example of a wicked man who ground\r\nhis wife and children into paint.\r\n\r\nIn Emerson's later days he was undoubtedly a powerful educational\r\ninfluence in the town.  He was a man of much public spirit.\r\nIn his philosophy his \"soul was like a star and dwelt apart.\"\r\n\r\nBut he had a heart full of human affections.  He loved the\r\ntown.  He loved his country.  He loved his family.  He loved\r\nhis neighbors and friends.  He could be stirred deeply on\r\nfit occasions by righteous indignation.  Some of the men\r\nwho frequented the tavern, posted in the barroom a scurrilous\r\nlibel upon old Dr. Bartlett, the venerable physician, who\r\nhad incurred their hostility by his zeal in enforcing the\r\nprohibitory laws.  Emerson heard of it and repaired to the\r\nspot and tore down the offensive paper with his own hand.\r\nAfter Wendell Phillips made an equally scurrilous attack\r\non Judge Hoar, Emerson refused to take his hand.\r\n\r\nIn his lament for his beautiful boy he uttered the voice of\r\nparental sorrow in immortal accents.  In the poems, \"In Memoriam,\"\r\nand in \"The Dirge,\" he records how lonely the lovely Concord\r\nValley is to him since his brothers are gone as he wanders\r\nthere in the long sunny afternoon:\r\n\r\n  Harken to you pine warbler,\r\n  Singing aloft in the tree!\r\n  Hearest thou, O, traveller,\r\n  What he singeth to me?\r\n\r\n  Not unless God made sharp thine ear\r\n  With sorrow such as mine,\r\n  Out of that delicate lay couldst thou\r\n  Its heavy tale divine.\r\n\r\nBut I think that the life of his younger brother Charles,\r\nthough he died so early, was felt as an even greater force in\r\nConcord than that of Waldo.\r\n\r\nI hope I may be pardoned if I put on record here a slight\r\nand imperfect tribute to the memory of Charles Emerson, who\r\nwas betrothed to my eldest sister.  It is nearly seventy\r\nyears ago.  Yet the sweet and tender romance is still fresh\r\nin my heart.  He was a descendant of a race of Concord clergymen,\r\nincluding Peter Bulkeley, the founder of the town.  He was\r\nborn in Boston, but spent much of his youth in Concord in\r\nthe household of Dr. Ripley, who was the second husband of\r\nthe grandmother of the Emersons.  He studied law partly at\r\nCambridge Law School, partly in Daniel Webster's office in\r\nBoston, and afterward with my father in Concord.  When my\r\nfather took his seat in Congress, in 1835, Emerson succeeded\r\nto his office, and if he had lived would have succeeded to\r\nhis practice.  Waldo Emerson had left it on record that he\r\nwas led to choose Concord as a dwelling-place to be near his\r\nbrother.  Waldo's house had been enlarged to make room for\r\nCharles and his bride under the same roof.  The house was\r\nready and the wedding near at hand when, in riding from Boston\r\nto Concord on top of the stage, Charles took a violent cold,\r\nwhich was followed by pleurisy and death.  He was of a very\r\nsociable nature, knew all the town people, lectured before\r\nthe Lyceum, had a class in the Sunday-school and used to speak\r\nin the Lyceum debates.  He had a very pleasant wit.  He was\r\non the committee for the celebration of the settlement of\r\nthe town in 1835, at the end of two hundred years, and about\r\nthe same time was on a committee to attend the celebration\r\nat Acton, where the people claimed for themselves all the\r\nglory of the Concord Fight.  He had thought it likely the\r\nActon people would ask him to speak.  But they did not.  As\r\nhe was riding back in the chaise, he said if they had asked\r\nhim to speak, he had it in mind to give as a toast, \"The blessed\r\nMemory of the Pilgrim Fathers, who first landed at Acton.\"\r\n\r\nHe was especially fond of boys, and they of him.  When he\r\ndied, every schoolboy thought he had lost a friend.  One\r\nhad a knife and another a book or a picture which he prized,\r\nand another a pair of skates which Charles Emerson had given\r\nhim.  It may be a fond exaggeration, but I think he was the\r\nmost brilliant intellect ever born in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, who was consulted as to where Emerson should\r\nsettle, said, \"Settle!  Let him settle anywhere.  Let him\r\nsettle in the midst of the back woods of Maine, the clients\r\nwill throng after him.\"  Mr. Everett delivered an eloquent\r\neulogy after his death, at the Phi Beta Kappa dinner at Harvard.\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes' exquisite tribute in his Phi Beta poems is well\r\nknown:\r\n\r\n  Thou calm, chaste scholar!  I can see thee now,\r\n  The first young laurels on they pallid brow,\r\n  O'er thy slight figure floating lightly down\r\n  In graceful folds the academic gown,\r\n  On thy curled lip the classic lines that taught\r\n  How nice the mind that sculptured them with thought,\r\n  And triumph glistening in the clear blue eye,\r\n  Too bright to live,--but Oh! too fair to die.\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes also says in his last tribute to Waldo:\r\n\r\n\"Of Charles Chauncey, the youngest brother, I knew something\r\nin my college days.  A beautiful, high-souled, pure, exquisitely\r\ndelicate nature in a slight but finely wrought mortal frame,\r\nhe was for me the very ideal of an embodied celestial intelligence.\r\nI may venture to mention a trivial circumstance, because it\r\npoints to the character of his favorite reading, which was\r\nlikely to be guided by the same tastes as his brother's, and\r\nmay have been specially directed by him.  Coming into my room\r\none day, he took up a copy of Hazlitt's British Poets.  He\r\nopened it to the poem of Andrew Marvell's, entitled, 'The\r\nNymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn,' which he read\r\nto me with delight irradiating his expressive features.  The\r\nlines remained with me, or many of them, from that hour,--\r\n\r\n  Had it lived long, it would have been\r\n  Lilies without, roses within.\r\n\r\n\"I felt as many have felt after being with his brother, Ralph\r\nWaldo, that I had entertained an angel visitant.  The fawn\r\nof Marvell's imagination survives in my memory as the fitting\r\nimage to recall this beautiful youth; a soul glowing like\r\nthe rose of morning with enthusiasm, a character white as\r\nthe lilies in its purity.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Samuel May, who was in the class after Emerson's\r\nat Harvard, told me that the impression his character and\r\nperson made upon the students of his time was so great that\r\nwhen he passed through the college yard, everybody turned\r\nto look after him, as in later days men looked after Webster\r\nwhen he passed down State Street.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joseph H. Cross, now (1903) still living, the oldest\r\ngraduate of Harvard, was his classmate.  I received this letter\r\nfrom him a few years ago:\r\n\r\n66 BRADFORD ST., LAWRENCE,\r\n  January 8, 1897.\r\n  HON. G. F. HOAR,\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\nYours of 5th inst. is before me; and I am glad to remember\r\nmy classmate Emerson and answer your inquiries.  I knew that\r\nhe studied law in your Honored Father's office, and was betrothed\r\nto your eldest sister.\r\n\r\nYour first inquiry is \"as to his looks.\"  He was above medium\r\nheight, well proportioned and straight as an arrow, brown\r\nhair and clear blue eyes, with fair complexion and handsome\r\nfeatures.  \"His scholarship and talents,\" both of the highest\r\norder.  The class regarded him as the first and best scholar,\r\ndignified and refined in manners, courteous and amiable in\r\nspirit.  He had great influence in his own class, and was\r\nmuch esteemed and beloved by all.  I think the impression\r\nhe made upon all who knew him was that of a classical scholar\r\nand a perfect gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Channing said when he died that all New England mourned\r\nhis loss.\r\n\r\nAlthough Charles was seven years the younger, his brother\r\nWaldo speaks of him as his own master and teacher.  The following\r\nletter was written by Waldo to his aunt Mary just after Charles's\r\ndeath.  A part of it is printed in Cabot's Biography.  Waldo\r\nand my sister, Elizabeth, heard of the extremity of his danger,\r\nand were on their way to see him, but arrived too late to\r\nfind him alive.\r\n\r\n\"12 May.\r\n\r\n\"You have already heard that E. and I arrived too late to\r\nsee Charles.  He died on Monday afternoon, immediately after\r\nreturning from a ride with Mother.  He got out of the coach\r\nalone, walked up the steps and into the house without assistance,\r\nthen sat down upon the stairs, fainted and never recovered.\r\nYesterday afternoon we attended his funeral, and that is the\r\nend on this side Heaven, of his extraordinary promise, the\r\nunion of such shining gifts,--grace and genius, and sense\r\nand virtue.  What a loss is this to us all--to Elizabeth and\r\nMother and you and me.  In him I have lost all my society.\r\nI sought no other and formed my habits to live with him.  I\r\ndeferred to him on so many questions and trusted him more\r\nthan myself, that I feel as if I had lost the best part of\r\nmyself.  In him were the foundations of so solid a confidence\r\nand friendship that all the years of life leaned upon him.\r\nHis genius too was a fountain inexhaustible of thoughts and\r\nkept me ever curious and expectant.  Nothing was too great,\r\nnothing too beautiful for his grasp or his expression, and\r\nas brilliant as his power of illustration was, he stuck like\r\na mathematician to his truth and never added a syllable for\r\ndisplay.  I cannot tell you how much I have valued his conversation\r\nfor these last two or three years, and he has never stopped\r\ngrowing, but has ripened from month to month.  Indeed, the\r\nweight of his thoughts and the fresh and various forms in\r\nwhich he constantly clothed them has made Shakespeare more\r\nconceivable to me, as Shakespeare was almost the only genius\r\nwhom he wholly loved.  His taste was unerring.  What he called\r\ngood was good, but so severe was it that very few works and\r\nvery few men could satisfy him, and this because his standard\r\nwas a pure ideal beauty and he never forgot himself so far\r\nas to accept any lower actual one in lieu of it.  But I must\r\nnot begin yet to enumerate his perfections.  I shall not know\r\nwhere to stop, and what would be bare truth to me would sound\r\non paper like the fondest exaggeration.\r\n\r\n\"I mourn for the Commonwealth, which has lost before it yet\r\nhad learned his name the promise of his eloquence and rare\r\npublic gifts.  He blessed himself that he had been bred from\r\ninfancy as it were in the public eye, and he looked forward\r\nto the debates in the Senate on great political questions\r\nas to his fit and native element.  And with reason, for in\r\nextempore debate his speech was music, and the precision,\r\nthe flow and the elegance of his discourse equally excellent.\r\nFamiliar as I was with his powers, when a year ago I first\r\nheard him take part in a debate, he surprised me with his\r\nsuccess.  He spoke so well that he was impatient of writing\r\nas not being a fit medium for him.  I never shall hear such\r\nspeaking as his, for his memory was a garden of immortal\r\nflowers, and all his reading came up to him as he talked, to\r\nclear, elevate and decorate the subject of his present thought.\r\nBut I shall never have done describing, as I see well I shall\r\nnever cease grieving as long as I am on the earth that he\r\nhas left it.  It seems no longer worth living in, if whatever\r\ndelights us in it departs.  He has quitted forever the apparent,\r\nthe partial.  He has gone to make acquaintance with the real,\r\nthe good, the divine, and to find mates and co-operators such\r\nas we could not offer him.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Emerson entered with zeal and sympathy into the daily\r\nlife of the people of Concord.  He delivered a few lectures,\r\nwhich were quite celebrated.  Some of his manuscripts are\r\nin existence, and there is a boyish essay or two in the _Harvard\r\nMagazine,_ one on Conversation and one on Friendship, which\r\nshow a singular charm and simplicity of style.  He wrote the\r\nepitaph on the tomb of Professor Ashmun at Mount Auburn, and\r\na tribute to his friend, James Jackson, Jr., which is preserved\r\nin Jackson's memoir by his father.\r\n\r\nMiss Martineau, in a chapter of her autobiography written\r\nin 1836, describes the feeling in Boston in regard to the\r\nopposition to slavery, which seems now incredible even to\r\nthose who remember it.  She says:\r\n\r\n\"The Emersons, for the adored Charles Emerson was living then,\r\nwere not men to join an association for any object . . . . But\r\nat the time of the hubbub against me in Boston, Charles Emerson\r\nstood alone of a large company in defence of free thought\r\nand speech, and declared that he had rather see Boston in\r\nashes than that I or anybody should be debarred in any way\r\nfrom perfectly free speech.\"\r\n\r\nRobert C. Winthrop, who was Charles Emerson's intimate friend\r\nin boyhood, wrote for the _Advertizer_ a beautiful obituary\r\nnotice.  He says:  \"Emerson was eminently a man of genius.\r\nWe know not that in his riper years he ever wrote a line of\r\npoetry, but no one could have listened to him, either in private\r\nor public without feeling that he had a poet's power; while\r\nhis prose composition was of so pure and finished a style\r\nas to show plainly that close perusal of the English Classics\r\nin which he so much delighted . . . . One opinion which Mr.\r\nEmerson had early formed, and which had he been spared to\r\nmature life might have contributed much to his eminence may,\r\nin the sad event which has occurred, have contracted the circle\r\nof his fame . . . . He had formed in his own mind a standard\r\nof education far beyond that which can be completed, even\r\nby the most faithful application, within the ordinary rounds\r\nof school and college--an education in which every man must\r\nbe mainly his own master.  In the work of this enlarged self-\r\neducation he was engaged, and, until it was finished, he shrunk\r\nfrom the appearance of attempting to instruct others.  He\r\nhad in him all the elements which would have insured the success\r\nof early efforts at display--a fluent speech, a fine elocution,\r\nquick conception, a brilliant fancy.  But his ambition, . . .\r\nwhile it aspired to a lofty eminence, was content to see that\r\neminence still in the distance.\"  Mr. Winthrop adds, \"Principle,\r\nunyielding and uncompromising principle, was the very breath\r\nof his soul, and pervaded and animated his whole intellectual\r\nsystem . . . . He openly professed what he believed, and he acted\r\nup to his professions.  He not only held conscience the guide\r\nof his life, but he took care to school and discipline that\r\nconscience so that its dictates should always conform to truth,\r\nto duty, to the laws of God.  He was an honorable, high-minded,\r\nvirtuous man--a sincere and devout Christian . . . . He has\r\nfallen at the very gate of an honorable and eminent career,\r\nand a thousand hopes are buried in his grave.\"\r\n\r\nA few years before Mr. Winthrop died I met him in Cambridge,\r\nat the Peabody Museum, of which we were both trustees.  The\r\ntrustees were gathered in their room waiting for the meeting\r\nto be called to order.  Mr. Winthrop was talking about his\r\ncollege days.  I asked him how it happened that there were\r\nso many distinguished persons, in various departments of excellence,\r\nwho were graduated from Harvard about his time, in his class\r\nand in the few classes following and preceding.  I said that\r\nsometimes there would be several orators, or eminent men of\r\nscience, or eminent classical scholars, or eminent teachers,\r\ngraduated about the same time, and their excellence would\r\nbe attributed to some one instructor; but that in his time\r\nthere seemed to be a crop of great men in all departments\r\nof life--in natural history, in the pulpit, the bar, in oratory,\r\nin literature, and in public life.  Mr. Winthrop rose to\r\nhis feet from this chair and brought his hand down with great\r\nemphasis on the table as he answered: \"It was the influence\r\nof Charles Emerson, Sir.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Emerson delivered just before his death a very beautiful\r\nand impressive lecture on Socrates.  It was long remembered\r\nby the people of Concord.  It is said that they who heard\r\nit never forgot his beautiful figure and glowing countenance\r\nas he ended a passage of great eloquence at the close of the\r\nlecture with the words,\r\n\r\n  \"God for thee has done His part.  Do thine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hawthorne had published some short stories which had already\r\nmade his name quite celebrated, but his great fame was still\r\nto be gained.  He was poor and had a good deal of difficulty\r\nin gaining a decent living for himself and his young wife.\r\nI will not undertake to repeat the story of his life which\r\nHawthorne has told so beautifully in his \"Mosses from an Old\r\nManse.\"  I knew Mrs. Hawthorne very well indeed.  She was\r\na great friend of my oldest sister and used to visit my father's\r\nhouse when I was a boy, before she was married.  It was owing\r\nto that circumstance that the Hawthornes came to live in Concord.\r\nShe was quite fond of me.  I used to get strawberries and\r\nwild flowers for her, and she did me great honor to draw my\r\nportrait, which now, fortunately or unfortunately, is lost.\r\nI went up to the house while they were absent on their wedding\r\njourney when I was a boy of fourteen or fifteen to help put\r\nthings in order for the reception of the young couple.\r\n\r\nThe furniture was very cheap; a good deal of it was made\r\nof common maple.  But Mrs. Hawthorne, who was an artist,\r\nhad decorated it by drawings and paintings on the backs of\r\nthe chairs and on the bureaus and bedsteads.  On the headboard\r\nof her bed was a beautiful copy, painted by herself, of Guido's\r\nAurora, with its exquisite light figures and horses and youths\r\nand maidens flying through the air.\r\n\r\nI never knew Hawthorne except as a stately figure, whom I\r\nsaw sometimes in Concord streets and sometimes in his own\r\nhome.  He rarely, if ever, opened his lips in my hearing.\r\nHe was always very silent, hardly spoke in the presence of\r\nany visitor with whom he was not very intimate.  So far as\r\nI know he never visited at the houses of his neighbors and\r\nnever went to town-meeting.  The latter was a deadly sin in\r\nthe eyes of his democratic neighbors.  Mr. Emerson induced\r\nhim, one evening, to be one of a small company at his house.\r\nBut Hawthorne kept silent and at last went to the window and\r\nlooked out at the stars.  One of the ladies said to the person\r\nnext her:  \"How well he rides his horses of the night.\"  He\r\nwas very fond of long walks, and of rowing on the river with\r\nThoreau and Ellery Channing.\r\n\r\nThe Old Manse was built in 1759 by the Rev. Daniel Bliss\r\nfor his daughter Phoebe on her marriage to the Rev. William\r\nEmerson.  She was grandmother of Waldo Emerson.  Her second\r\nhusband was the Rev. Dr. Ripley.\r\n\r\nI knew Henry Thoreau very intimately.  I went to school with\r\nhim when I was a little boy and he was a big one.  Afterward\r\nI was a scholar in his school.\r\n\r\nHe was very fond of small boys, and used to take them out\r\nwith him in his boat, and make bows and arrows for them, and\r\ntake part in their games.  He liked also to get a number of\r\nthe little chaps of a Saturday afternoon and take them out\r\nin his boat, or for a long walk in the woods.\r\n\r\nHe knew the best places to find huckleberries and blackberries\r\nand chestnuts and lilies and cardinal and other rare flowers.\r\nWe used to call him Trainer Thoreau, because the boys called\r\nthe soldiers the \"trainers,\" and he had a long, measured stride\r\nand an erect carriage which made him seem something like a\r\nsoldier, although he was short and rather ungainly in figure.\r\nHe had a curved nose which reminded one a little of the beak\r\nof a parrot.\r\n\r\nHis real name was David Henry Thoreau, although he changed\r\nthe order of his first two names afterward.  He was a great\r\nfinder of Indian arrow-heads, spear-heads, pestles, and other\r\nstone implements which the Indians had left behind them, of\r\nwhich there was great abundance in the Concord fields and\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nHe knew the rare forest birds and all the ways of birds and\r\nwild animals.  Naturalists commonly know birds and beasts\r\nand wild flowers as a surgeon who has dissected the human\r\nbody, or perhaps sometimes a painter who has made pictures\r\nof them knows men and women.  But he knew birds and beasts\r\nas one boy knows another--all their delightful little habits\r\nand fashions.  He had the most wonderful good fortune.  We\r\nused to say that if anything happened in the deep woods which\r\nonly came about once in a hundred years, Henry Thoreau would\r\nbe sure to be on the spot at the time and know the whole story.\r\n\r\n  It seemed that Nature could not raise\r\n  A plant in any secret place,\r\n  In quaking bog or snowy hill,\r\n  Beneath the grass that shades the rill,\r\n  Under the snow, between the rocks,\r\n  In damp fields known to bird and fox,\r\n  But he would come in the very hour\r\n  It opened in its virgin bower,\r\n  As if a sunbeam showed the place,\r\n  And tell its long-descended race.\r\n  It seemed as if the breezes brought him;\r\n  It seemed as if the sparrows taught him;\r\n  As if by secret sight he knew\r\n  Where, in the far fields, the orchis grew.\r\n  Many haps fall in the field\r\n  Seldom seen by wishful eyes,\r\n  But all her shows did Nature yield,\r\n  To please and win this pilgrim wise.\r\n  He saw the partridge drum in the woods;\r\n  He heard the woodcock's evening hymn;\r\n  He found the tawny thrushes' broods;\r\n  And the shy hawk did wait for him;\r\n  What others did at distance hear,\r\n  And guessed within the thicket's gloom,\r\n  Was shown to this philosopher,\r\n  And at his bidding seemed to come.\r\n\r\nThese lines fit Henry Thoreau exactly.  Most people think\r\nEmerson had him in mind when he wrote them.  But as a matter\r\nof fact, they were written before he knew Henry Thoreau.\r\n\r\nI wonder how many know the woodcock's evening hymn.  I have\r\nknown many sportsmen and naturalists who never heard it or\r\nheard of it.  When the female is on her nest the male woodcock\r\nflies straight up into the sky, folds his wings and falls\r\ndown through the air, coming down within a foot or two of\r\nthe nest from which he ascended, pouring out a beautiful song,\r\nwhich he never sings at any other time.  He is said to be\r\none of the best and sweetest of our song birds.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that Emerson did not know Henry Thoreau\r\nuntil after Thoreau had been some years out of college.  Henry\r\nwalked to Boston, eighteen miles, to hear one of Emerson's\r\nlectures, and walked home again in the night after the lecture\r\nwas over.  Emerson heard of it, and invited him to come to\r\nhis house and hear the lectures read there, which he did.\r\nPeople used to say that Thoreau imitated Emerson, and Lowell\r\nhas made this charge in his satire, \"A Fable for Critics\";\r\n\r\n  There comes ----, for instance; to see him's rare sport,\r\n  Tread in Emerson's tracks with legs painfully short.\r\n\r\nI think there is nothing in it.  Thoreau's style is certainly\r\nfresh and original.  His tastes and thoughts are his own.\r\nHis peculiarities of bearing and behavior came to him naturally\r\nfrom his ancestors of the isle of Guernsey.\r\n\r\nI retained his friendship to his death.  I have taken many\r\na long walk with him.  I used to go down to see him in the\r\nwinter days in my vacations in his hut near Walden.  He was\r\ncapital company.  He was a capital guide in the wood.  He\r\nliked to take out the boys in his boat.  He was fond of discoursing.\r\nI do not think he was vain.  But he liked to do his thinking\r\nout loud, and expected that you should be an auditor rather\r\nthan a companion.\r\n\r\nI have heard Thoreau say in private a good many things which\r\nafterward appeared in his writings.  One day when we were\r\nwalking, he leaned his back against a rail fence and discoursed\r\nof the shortness of the time since the date fixed for the\r\ncreation, measured by human lives.  \"Why,\" he said, \"sixty\r\nold women like Nabby Kettle\" (a very old woman in Concord),\r\n\"taking hold of hands, would span the whole of it.\"  He repeats\r\nthis in one of his books, adding, \"They would be but a small\r\ntea-party, but their gossip would make universal history.\"\r\n\r\nAnother man who was famous as a writer went to school and\r\nafterward tended store in Concord in my childhood.  This was\r\nGeorge H. Derby, better known as John Phoenix.  He was also\r\nvery fond of small boys.  I remember his making me what I\r\nthought a wonderful and beautiful work of art, by taking a\r\nsheet of stiff paper of what was called elephant foolscap,\r\nand folding it into a very small square, and then with a penknife\r\ncutting out small figures of birds and beasts.  When the sheet\r\nwas opened again these were repeated all over the sheet, and\r\nmade it appear like a piece of handsome lace.\r\n\r\nHe did not get along very well with his employer, who was\r\na snug and avaricious person.  He would go to Boston once\r\na week to make his purchases, leaving Derby in charge of the\r\nstore.  Derby would lie down at full length on the counter,\r\nget a novel, and was then very unwilling to be disturbed to\r\nwait on customers.  If a little girl came in with a tin kettle\r\nto get some molasses, he would say the molasses was all out,\r\nand they would have some more next week.  So the employer\r\nfound that some of his customers were a good deal annoyed.\r\n\r\nAnother rather famous writer who lived in Concord in my time\r\nwas Mr. A. Bronson Alcott.  He used to talk to the children\r\nin the Sunday-school, and occasionally would gather them together\r\nin the evening for a long discourse.  I am ashamed to say\r\nthat we thought Mr. Alcott rather stupid.  He did not make\r\nany converts to his theories among the boys.\r\n\r\nHe once told us that it was wicked to eat animal food; that\r\nthe animal had the same right to his life that we had to ours,\r\nand we had no right to destroy the lives of any of God's\r\ncreatures for our own purposes.  He lived only on vegetable\r\nfood, as he told us.  But he had on at the time a very comfortable\r\npair of calfskin boots, and the boys could not reconcile his\r\nnotion that it was wicked to kill animals to eat, with killing\r\nanimals that he might wear their hides.  When such inconsistencies\r\nwere pointed out to him he gave a look of mild rebuke at the\r\naudacious offender, and went on with his discourse as if nothing\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nThe people who do not think very much of Alcott ought to\r\nspeak with a god deal of modesty when they remember how highly\r\nEmerson valued him, and how sure was Emerson's judgment; but\r\ncertainly nobody will attribute to Alcott much of the logical\r\nfaculty.  Emerson told me once:\r\n\r\n\"I got together some people a little while ago to meet Alcott\r\nand hear him converse.  I wanted them to know what a rare\r\nfellow he was.  But we did not get along very well.  Poor\r\nAlcott had a hard time.  Theodore Parker came all stuck full\r\nof knives.  He wound himself round Alcott like an anaconda;\r\nyou could hear poor Alcott's bones crunch.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret Fuller used to visit Concord a good deal, and at\r\none time boarded in the village for several months.\r\n\r\nShe was very peculiar in her ways, and made people whom she\r\ndid not like feel very uncomfortable in her presence.  She\r\nwas not generally popular, although the persons who knew her\r\nbest valued her genius highly.  But old Doctor Bartlett, a\r\nvery excellent and kind old doctor, though rather gruff in\r\nmanner, could not abide her.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight one very dark, stormy night the doctor was\r\ncalled out of bed by a sharp knocking at the door.  He got\r\nup and put his head out of the window, and said, \"Who's there?\r\nWhat do you want?\"  He was answered by a voice in the darkness\r\nbelow, \"Doctor, how much camphire can anybody take by mistake\r\nwithout its killing them?\"  To which the reply was, \"Who's\r\ntaken it?\"  And the answer was \"Margaret Fuller.\"  The doctor\r\nanswered in great wrath, as he slammed down the window, and\r\nreturned to bed:  \"A peck.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Ellery Channing, the poet, was a constant visitor\r\nof my sister, and later of my brother Edward.  He was a moody\r\nand solitary person, except in the company of a few close\r\nfriends who testified to the charming and delightful quality\r\nof his companionship.  I suppose his poems will outlast a\r\ngreat many greater reputations.  But they will always find\r\nvery few readers in any generation.\r\n\r\nChanning visited my elder sister almost every day or evening\r\nfor a good while, but rarely remained more than two or three\r\nminutes if he found anybody else in the room.\r\n\r\nGeorge William Curtis, afterward the famous orator, and his\r\nbrother, Burrill, occupied for a year or two a small farmhouse\r\nor hut, with one or two rooms in it, in Concord, on the Lincoln\r\nroad.  They had been at Brook Farm and came to Concord, I\r\nsuppose attracted by Emerson.  They came to my father's house\r\nduring their stay there every afternoon, and their call was\r\nas much a regular incident of the day as any stated meal.\r\nEach of them was a boy of a very pleasant and delightful nature.\r\nI think if George Curtis had dwelt almost anywhere but in\r\nNew York city, he would have been a very powerful influence\r\nin the public life of his generation.  But he did not find\r\nany congenial associates in the men in New York who had any\r\ncapacity to effect much good.  His pure and lofty counsel\r\nfell unheeded upon the ears of his near neighbors, and the\r\npeople of Massachusetts did not listen very patiently to lectures\r\non political purity or reform in civil service from New York\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nI never maintained any considerable intimacy with Curtis,\r\nalthough I have a few letters from him, expressing his regard\r\nfor some of my kindred or his interest and sympathy in something\r\nI had said or done.  These I value exceedingly.  One of the\r\nvery last articles he wrote for _Harper's Weekly,_ written\r\njust before his death, contains a far too kind estimate of\r\nmy public service.\r\n\r\nThe Concord quality has come down with its people from the\r\nfirst settlement.  The town was founded by Peter Bulkeley.\r\nHe was a clergyman at Odell in Bedfordshire, where the church\r\nover which he was settled is still standing.  He was a gentleman\r\nof good family and of a considerable estate which he spent\r\nfor the benefit of the people whom he led into the wilderness.\r\nHe encountered the hostility of Laud and, to use the phrase\r\nof that time, was \"silenced for non-conformity.\" With Major\r\nSimon Willard, he made a bargain with the Indians, just to\r\nboth parties, and with which both parties were perfectly satisfied,\r\nwhich rendered the name of Concord so appropriate, although\r\nin fact the name was given to the settlement before the company\r\nleft Boston.  That pulpit was occupied by Bulkeley and his\r\ndescendants either by blood or marriage, from 1635 to 1696;\r\nfrom 1738 to 1841; and from 1882 to 1893.\r\n\r\nI was able some forty years ago to settle in Concord a matter\r\nwhich had puzzled English historians, as to the legitimacy\r\nof the famous statesman and Chief Justice, Oliver St. John.\r\nLord Campbell, in his \"Lives of the Chief Justices,\" says:\r\n\"It is a curious circumstance that there should be a dispute\r\nabout the parentage of such a distinguished individual, who\r\nflourished so recently.  Lord Clarendon, who knew him intimately\r\nfrom his youth, who practised with him in the Court of King's\r\nBench, who sat in the House of Commons with him, and who was\r\nboth associated with him and opposed to him in party strife,\r\nrepeatedly represents him as illegitimate; and states that\r\nhe was 'a natural son of the house of Bolingbroke.'  Lord Bacon's\r\naccount of his origin is equivocal--calling him 'a gentleman\r\nas it seems of an ancient house and name.'  By genealogists\r\nand heralds a legitimate pedigree is assigned to him, deducing\r\nhis descent in the right male line from William St. John,\r\nwho came in with the Conqueror; but some of them describe\r\nhim as the son of Sir John St. John, of Lydiard Tregose in\r\nWiltshire, and others as the son of Oliver St. John of Cagshoe\r\nin Bedfordshire, and they differ equally respecting his mother.\r\nLord Clarendon could hardly be mistaken on such a point,\r\nand I cannot help suspecting that the contrary assertions\r\nproceed from a desire to remove the bar sinister from the\r\nshield of a Chief Justice.\"\r\n\r\nLord Campbell has had diligent search made in the archives\r\nof Oxford and Lincoln's Inn, but does not find anything to\r\nchange his opinion.\r\n\r\nFortunately we are able to settle the question about which\r\nLord Campbell and Lord Bacon and Lord Clarendon were misled,\r\nin Old Concord.  Peter Bulkeley was the uncle of Oliver St.\r\nJohn.  He speaks of him in his will, and leaves him his Bible.\r\nBulkeley's Gospel-Covenant, a book the substance of which\r\nwas originally preached to his congregation, is dedicated\r\nto Oliver St. John.  In the Epistle Dedicatory, he speaks\r\nof the pious and godly lives of St. John's parents, and alludes\r\nto the dying words of St. John's father as something which\r\nhe and St. John had heard, but which was not known to other\r\nmen.  \"I speak a mystery to others but not unto your Lordship.\"\r\n\r\nSo it is quite clear that St. John could not have been born\r\nout of wedlock, and the son of a man who had seduced the\r\nsister of this eminent and pious clergyman.\r\n\r\nIn Noble's \"Memoirs of the Cromwell Family,\" published about\r\nseventy-five years after the death of St. John, he is said\r\nto be the son of Oliver St. John of Cagshoe in Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Lives of the Chief Justices\" was first published,\r\nI wrote to Lord Campbell, telling him these facts, and received\r\nthe following letter in reply:\r\n\r\nLONDON, July 9th, 1861.\r\n\r\n_Sir_\r\n\r\nI thank you very sincerely for your interesting letter of\r\nDecember 13th, respecting Lord Chief Justice St. John.  I\r\nthink you establish his legitimacy quite satisfactorily and\r\nin any future edition of my Lives of the Chief Justices I\r\nshall certainly avail myself of your researches.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor to be\r\n  Sir\r\n  Your obliged and obedient Servant\r\n  CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n  The Honorable\r\n  Geo. F. Hoar.\r\n\r\nSomething of Bulkeley's character may be gathered from this\r\nextract from the Gospel-Covenant, which Mr. Emerson, who was\r\nhis descendant, loved to quote.  Think of these words, uttered\r\nto his little congregation in the wilderness; the only company\r\nof white men in the Western Hemisphere who dwelt away from\r\ntide-water:\r\n\r\n\"And for ourselves, the people of New England, wee should\r\nin a speciall manner, labour to shine forth in holinesse\r\nabove other people; we have that plenty and abundance of\r\nordinances and meanes of grace as few people enjoy the like;\r\nwee are as a City set upon a hill, in the open view of all\r\nthe earth, the eyes of the world are upon us, because wee\r\nprofesse ourselves to be a people in Covenant with God, and\r\ntherefore not only the Lord our God, with whom we have made\r\nCovenant, but heaven and earth, Angels and men, that are witnesses\r\nof our profession, will cry shame upon us, if we walk contrary\r\nto the Covenant which we have professed to walk in; if we\r\nopen the mouthes of men against our profession, by reason\r\nof the scandalousnesse of our lives, wee (of all men) shall\r\nhave the greater sinne.\r\n\r\n\"To conclude, let us study so to walk, that this may be our\r\nexcellency and dignity among the Nations of the world, among\r\nwhich we live; That they may be constrained to say of us,\r\nonely this people is wise, an holy and blessed people: that\r\nall that see us, may see and know that the name of the Lord\r\nis called upon us:  and that we are the seed which the Lord\r\nhath blessed.  Deut. 28. 10 Esay. 61. 9.  There is no people\r\nbut will strive to excell in something:  what can we excell\r\nin if not in holinesse?  If we look to number, we are the\r\nfewest; If to strength, we are the weakest; If to wealth\r\nand riches, we are the poorest of all the people of God throughout\r\nthe whole world, we cannot excell (nor so much as equall)\r\nother people in these things; and if we come short in grace\r\nand holiness too, we are the most despicable people under\r\nheaven; our worldy dignitie is gone, if we lose the glory\r\nof grace too, then is the glory wholly departed from our Israel,\r\nand we are become vile; strive we therefore herein to excell,\r\nand suffer not this crown to be taken away from us:  Be we\r\na holy people, so shall we be honorable before God and precious\r\nin the eyes of his Saints.\"\r\n\r\nTo these eminent Concord authors should be added the name\r\nof William S. Robinson.  He was one of the brightest and wittiest\r\nmen of his time.  He very seldom had praise for anybody, although\r\nfor a few of his old Anti-Slavery friends he had a huge liking.\r\nWhen I was a little boy he was in a newspaper office in Concord,\r\nwhere he got most of his education.  Afterward he was associated\r\nwith William Schouler in editing the Lowell _Courier,_ a Whig\r\npaper.  When Schouler became editor of the _Atlas,_ Robinson\r\nsucceeded to the paper.  But when the Free Soil movement\r\ncame in, he would not flinch or abate a jot in his radical\r\nAnti-Slavery principles, which were not very agreeable to\r\nthe proprietors of the cotton mills in Lowell, who depended\r\nboth for their material and their market largely upon the\r\nSouth.  Sumner described their alliance with their Southern\r\ncustomers as an alliance between the Lords of the Loom and\r\nthe Lords of the Lash.  So Robinson was compelled to give\r\nup his paper, in doing which he voluntarily embraced poverty\r\ninstead of a certain and lucrative employment.  He started\r\nan Anti-Slavery weekly paper in Lowell known as the Lowell\r\n_American._  That afforded him a bare and difficult living\r\nfor a few years.  After the Anti-Slavery people got into power\r\nhe was made Clerk of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.\r\nThen he began to write his famous letters to the Springfield\r\n_Republican,_ which he signed Warrington.  They were full\r\nof wit and wisdom and displayed great knowledge of the best\r\nEnglish literature.  He made many enemies and finally, by\r\na concert among them, was turned out of office.  He lost his\r\nhealth not long after, and died prematurely.\r\n\r\nHe was quite unsparing in his attacks on anybody who offended\r\nhim, or against whom he took a dislike; and he seemed to dislike\r\neverybody whom he did not know.  It was said of him that,\r\nlike the rain of Heaven, he \"fell alike on the just and on\r\nthe unjust.\"  He attacked some of the most venerable and worthy\r\ncitizens of the Commonwealth without any apparent reason.\r\nHe used to call Chief Justice Chapman, one of the worthiest\r\nand kindest of men, Chief Justice Wheelgrease.  He had a controversy\r\nin his paper of long standing with a man named Piper, a pompous\r\nand self-important little personage, who edited the Fitchburg\r\n_Reveille._  That was a Whig paper which circulated in the\r\ncountry towns where Robinson's paper was chiefly taken.  He\r\nmade poor Piper's life unhappy.  One of the issues of his\r\npaper contained a life of Piper.  It begun by saying that\r\nPiper began life as the driver of a fish-cart in Marblehead,\r\nand that he was discharged by his employer on account of the\r\ndiffuseness of his style.  He quoted with great effect on\r\nOtis P. Lord the toast given by the Court Jester of Archbishop\r\nLaud's time:  \"Great Laud be to God, and Little Lord to the\r\nDevil.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was clerk of the House of Representatives there was\r\na story in the newspapers that he was preparing a treatise\r\non Parliamentary law.  He published a letter denying the statement.\r\nBut he added, that if he did write such a treatise, he should\r\nsum it up in one sentence:  \"Never have an ass in the chair.\"\r\n\r\nI was associated with him one day on the Committee on Resolutions\r\nof the Republican State Convention, held in Worcester.  The\r\nCommittee went over to my office to consult.  While we were\r\ntalking together Robinson broke out with his accustomed objurgations\r\nlevelled at several very worthy and excellent men.  I said:\r\n\"William, it is fortunate that you did not live in the Revolutionary\r\ntime.  How you would have hated General Washington.\"  He replied,\r\nwith a smile that indicated the gratification he would have\r\nhad if he could have got at him: \"He was an old humbug, wasn't\r\nhe?\"\r\n\r\nBut Robinson was always on the righteous side of any question\r\ninvolving righteousness.  He was kind, generous, absolutely\r\ndisinterested, and a great and beneficent power in the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nFARM AND SCHOOL\r\n\r\nI spent my life in Concord until I entered college except\r\none year when I lived on a farm in Lincoln.  There I had\r\nan opportunity to see at its best the character of the New\r\nEngland farmer, a character which has impressed itself so\r\nstrongly and so beneficently on our history.  Deacon James\r\nFarrar, for whom I worked, was, I believe, the fifth in descent\r\nfrom George Farrar, one of the founders of the town of Lincoln.\r\nAll these generations dwelt on the same farm and under the\r\nsame roof.  An ancient forest came to a point not far from\r\nthe house.  That, with a large river meadow and some fertile\r\nupland fields, made up the farm.  In every generation one\r\nor more of the family had gone to college and had become eminent\r\nin professional life, while one of them had stayed at home\r\nand carried on the farm.  An uncle of the Deacon with whom\r\nI lived was Timothy Farrar of New Ipswich, an eminent judge\r\nwho died considerably more than a hundred years old, and who\r\nwas the oldest graduate of Harvard.  Deacon James's own brother\r\nwas Professor John Farrar of Harvard, a famous mathematician\r\nin his day, thought by his pupils to be the most eloquent\r\nman of his time, although Webster and Everett and Channing\r\nwere his cotemporaries.  It was a healthy and simple life\r\nof plain living and high thinking.  But I think I got more\r\ngood out of it in learning how the best intelligence of the\r\nState of Massachusetts was likely to judge of the questions\r\nof morals and duty than I got afterward from my four years\r\nin college.  Two of the Deacon's sons succeeded him on the\r\nfarm.  One was his successor in his office in the church.\r\nAnother son, George Farrar, graduated at Amherst where he\r\nwas cotemporary with Dr. Storrs and Henry Ward Beecher.  He\r\ndied a few years after his admission to the Bar.  But he had\r\nalready given proof that he would, if he had lived, have taken\r\nrank among the foremost at the Bar in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBefore entering college I was for about six months a pupil\r\nof Mrs. Sarah Ripley of Waltham.  She removed to Concord with\r\nher husband afterward.  She was one of the most wonderful\r\nscholars of her time, or indeed of any time.  President Everett\r\nsaid she could fill any professor's chair at Harvard.  She\r\nwas an admirable mathematician.  She read the \"Mecanique Celeste\"\r\nof Laplace in the original without the aid of Dr. Bowditch's\r\ntranslation.  She was a fine German and Italian scholar.  She\r\nhad a great fondness for Greek literature, especially for\r\nPlato and AEschylus.  She was an accomplished naturalist.\r\nShe was simple as a child, an admirable wife and mother, performing\r\nperfectly all the commonest duties of the household.  The\r\nauthorities of Harvard used to send boys to her who were rusticated\r\nfor some offence.  She would keep them along in all their\r\nstudies, in most cases better instructed than they would have\r\nbeen if they had stayed in Cambridge.  I remember her now\r\nwith the strongest feeling of reverence, affection and gratitude.\r\nIn that I say what every other pupil of hers would say.  I\r\ndo not think she ever knew how much her boys loved her.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the Directors of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia\r\ntook steps to have the lives of three or four of the foremost\r\nwomen of the century that had just passed written as the best\r\nexamples of American womanhood for our first century.  Mrs.\r\nSchuyler was selected from New York, Mrs. Livermore from\r\nNew Hampshire, and Mrs. Randolph from Virginia.  Mrs. Ripley\r\nwas chosen as the representative of Massachusetts.  If anybody\r\ndoubt the capacity of the intellect of woman to rival that\r\nof man in any calling requiring the highest intellectual capacity,\r\nwithout in the least forfeiting any quality of a delicate\r\nwomanhood, let him read the \"Life of Sarah Ripley.\"\r\n\r\nAfter her death Mr. Emerson wrote the following notice of\r\nher.  It is not found in his collected works.\r\n\r\n\"Died in Concord, Massachusetts, on the 26th of July, 1867,\r\nMrs. Sarah Alden Ripley, aged seventy-four years.  The death\r\nof this lady, widely known and beloved, will be sincerely\r\ndeplored by many persons scattered in distant parts of the\r\ncountry, who have known her rare accomplishments and the singular\r\nloveliness of her character.  A lineal descendant of the first\r\ngovernor of Plymouth Colony, she was happily born and bred.\r\nHer father, Gamaliel Bradford, was a sea-captain of marked\r\nability, with heroic traits which old men will still remember,\r\nand though a man of action yet adding a taste for letters.\r\nHer brothers, younger than herself, were scholars, but her\r\nown taste for study was even more decided.  At a time when\r\nperhaps no other young woman read Greek, she acquired the\r\nlanguage with ease and read Plato,--adding soon the advantage\r\nof German commentators.\r\n\r\n\"After her marriage, when her husband, the well-known clergyman\r\nof Waltham, received boys in his house to be fitted for college,\r\nshe assumed the advanced instruction in Greek and Latin, and\r\ndid not fail to turn it to account by extending her studies\r\nin both languages.  It soon happened that students from Cambridge\r\nwere put under her private instruction and oversight.  If\r\nthe young men shared her delight in the book, she was interested\r\nat once to lead them to higher steps and more difficult but\r\nnot less engaging authors, and they soon learned to prize\r\nthe new world of thought and history thus opened.  Her best\r\npupils became her lasting friends.  She became one of the\r\nbest Greek scholars in the country, and continued, in her\r\nlatest years, the habit of reading Homer, the tragedians,\r\nand Plato.  But her studies took a wide range in mathematics,\r\nin natural philosophy, in psychology, in theology, as well\r\nas in ancient and modern literature.  She had always a keen\r\near open to whatever new facts astronomy, chemistry, of the\r\ntheories of light and heat had to furnish.  Any knowledge,\r\nall knowledge was welcome.  Her stores increased day by day.\r\nShe was absolutely without pedantry.  Nobody ever heard of\r\nher learning until a necessity came for its use, and then\r\nnothing could be more simple than her solution of the problem\r\nproposed to her.  The most intellectual gladly conversed with\r\none whose knowledge, however rich and varied, was always with\r\nher only the means of new acquisition.  Meantime her mind\r\nwas purely receptive.  She had no ambition to propound a theory,\r\nor to write her own name on any book, or plant, or opinion.\r\nHer delight in books was not tainted by any wish to shine,\r\nor any appetite for praise or influence.  She seldom and unwillingly\r\nused a pen, and only for necessity or affection.\r\n\r\n\"But this wide and successful study was, during all the hours\r\nof middle life, only the work of hours stolen from sleep,\r\nor was combined with some household task which occupied the\r\nhands and left the eyes free.  She was faithful to all the\r\nduties of wife and mother in a well-ordered and eminently\r\nhospitable household, wherein she was dearly loved, and where\r\n\r\n  'her heart\r\n  Life's lowliest duties on itself did lay.'\r\n\r\n\"She was not only the most amiable, but the tenderest of\r\nwomen, wholly sincere, thoughtful for others, and, though\r\ncareless of appearances, submitting with docility to the\r\nbetter arrangements with which her children or friends insisted\r\non supplementing her own negligence of dress; for her own\r\npart indulging her children in the greatest freedom, assured\r\nthat their own reflection, as it opened, would supply all\r\nneeded checks.  She was absolutely without appetite for luxury,\r\nor display, or praise, or influence, with entire indifference\r\nto trifles.  Not long before her marriage, one of her intimate\r\nfriends in the city, whose family were removing, proposed\r\nto her to go with her to the new house, and, taking some articles\r\nin her own hand, by way of trial artfully put into her hand\r\na broom, whilst she kept her in free conversation on some\r\nspeculative points, and this she faithfully carried across\r\nBoston Common, from Summer Street to Hancock Street, without\r\nhesitation or remark.\r\n\r\n\"Though entirely domestic in her habit and inclination, she\r\nwas everywhere a welcome visitor, and a favorite of society,\r\nwhen she rarely entered it.  The elegance of her tastes recommended\r\nher to the elegant, who were swift to distinguish her as they\r\nfound her simple manners faultless.  With her singular simplicity\r\nand purity, such as society could not spoil, nor much affect,\r\nshe was only entertained by it, and really went into it as\r\nchildren into a theatre,--to be diverted,--while her ready\r\nsympathy enjoyed whatever beauty of person, manners, or ornament\r\nit had to show.  If there was conversation, if there were\r\nthought or learning, her interest was commanded, and she gave\r\nherself up to the happiness of the hour.\r\n\r\n\"As she advanced in life, her personal beauty, not remarked\r\nin her youth, drew the notice of all, and age brought no fault\r\nbut the brief decay and eclipse of her intellectual powers.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1833, three years before Emerson wrote \"Nature,\" Mrs. Ripley\r\nsaid of him:  \"We regard him still, more than ever, as the\r\napostle of the Eternal Reason.  We do not like to hear the\r\ncrows, as Pindar says, caw at the bird of Jove.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* On the stone which marks Mrs. Ripley's grave in the beautiful\r\ncemetery at Concord, her children placed an inscription containing\r\na part of the passage with which Tacitus ends his Life of Agricola.\r\n\"It was a passage which was specially dear to her,\" says her\r\nbiographer; \"many of her friends will recall the fine glow of\r\nfeeling with which she read or quoted it; and to these it will\r\nalways be associated with her memory.  I cannot better close this\r\nimperfect sketch of her life than by giving the whole of it:  of\r\nno one was it ever more worthily spoken than of her.  The words\r\nenclosed in brackets are those which are on her gravestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Si quis piorum manibus locus; si, ut sapientibus placet, non\r\ncum corpore exstinguunter magnae animae; (placide quescas, nosque,\r\ndomum tuam, ab tuarum voces, quas neque lugeri neque plangi fas\r\nest:  admiratione te potius, temporalibus laudibus, et, si natura\r\nsuppedit, similitudine decoremus.)  Is verus honos, ea conjunctissimi\r\ncujusque pietas.  Id filiae quoque uxorique praeceperim, sic\r\npatris, sic mariti memoriam venerari, ut omnia facta dictaque\r\nejus secum revlvant; famamque ac figuram animi magis quam\r\ncorporis complectantur:  non quia intercedendum putem imaginibus,\r\nquae marmore aut aere finguntur, sed ut vultus hominum, ita simulacra\r\nvultus imbecilla ne mortalia sunt, forma mentis aeterna, quam\r\ntenere et exprimere non per alienam materiam et artem, sed tuis\r\nipse moribus posis.

There were some elementary\r\nlectures and recitations in astronomy and mechanics.  There\r\nwas a short course of lectures on chemistry, accompanied by\r\nexhibiting a few experiments.  But the students had no opportunity\r\nfor laboratory work.  There was a delightful course of instruction\r\nfrom Dr. Walker in ethics and metaphysics.  The college had\r\nrejected the old Calvinistic creed of New England and substituted\r\nin its stead the strict Unitarianism of Dr. Ware and Andrews\r\nNorton,--a creed in its substance hardly more tolerant or\r\nliberal than that which it had supplanted.  There was also\r\nsome instruction in modern languages,--German, French and\r\nItalian,--all of very slight value.  But the substance of\r\nthe instruction consisted in learning to translate rather\r\neasy Latin and Greek, writing Latin, and courses in algebra\r\nand geometry not very far advanced.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of admission were quite easy.  They were such\r\nas a boy of fourteen of good capacity, who could read and\r\nwrite the English language and had gone through some simple\r\nbook of arithmetic, could easily master in two years.  There\r\nwere three or four schools were the boys were pretty well\r\nfitted, so that they could translate Cicero and Virgil, Nepos\r\nand Sallust and Caesar and Xenophon and Homer.  The Boston\r\nLatin School, the Roxbury Latin School, Phillips Academy at\r\nExeter and Phillips Academy at Andover and Mrs. Ripley's\r\nschool at Waltham were the best schools for this purpose.\r\nThe boys from the Boston Latin School generally took their\r\nplaces at the head of the class when they entered.  Next came\r\nthe best scholars from the other schools I have named.  But\r\nthe bulk of the pupils were very poorly fitted.\r\n\r\nThere was, as it seems to me in looking back, little instruction\r\nof much value.  The good scholars and the bad went to the\r\nrecitation together.  The good ones lost the hour, and the\r\npoor scholars got the benefit of hearing the good ones recite.\r\nTheir mistakes were corrected by the professor.  They handed\r\nin written exercises in Latin and Greek which were examined\r\nby the instructor and the faults corrected, and returned.\r\nThere were, during the last three years, declamations once\r\na month, where the boy recited some piece of prose or poetry\r\nin the presence of the class, but got very little instruction\r\nor criticism from the professor.  Then, in the last three\r\nyears, English themes were required.  The subjects were given\r\nout by Professor Channing, himself a most accomplished and\r\nadmirable scholar in his line.  He seemed to choose his subjects\r\nwith a view of taxing the ingenuity of the boy to find anything\r\nto say about them instead of taking something which the boy\r\nknew about and devoting himself to improve his English style\r\nin expressing his thought.  Channing was a good critic.  His\r\npublished lectures on rhetoric and oratory, now almost wholly\r\nforgotten, remind one of Matthew Arnold in their delicate\r\nand discriminating touch.  He had a face and figure something\r\nlike that of Punch in the frontispiece of that magazine.  His\r\nmethod was to take the themes which the boys handed in one\r\nweek, look them over himself, then, a week after, meet the\r\nclass, call the boys in succession to sit down in a chair\r\nby the side of his table, read out passages from the theme,\r\nand ridicule them before the others.  It was a terrible ordeal\r\nfor a bashful or awkward boy.  Those of a more robust nature,\r\nor whose performance had nothing ridiculous in it, profited\r\nby the discipline.  But it certainly took all the starch and\r\ncourage out of me.  I never sat down to write my theme without\r\nfancying that grinning and scornful countenance looking at\r\nmy work.  So I used to write as few sentences as I thought\r\nwould answer so that I should not be punished for failure\r\nto bring in any theme at all, and never attempted to do my\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nBut the Faculty themselves were certainly an assemblage of\r\nvery able men.  Making all the allowance for the point of\r\nview, and that I was then a youth looking at my elders who\r\nhad become famous, and that I am now looking as an old man\r\nat young men, I still think there can be no comparison between\r\nthe college administrators of fifty years ago and those of\r\nto-day.  It was then the policy of the college to call into\r\nits service great men who had achieved eminent distinction\r\nin the world without.  It is now its policy to select for\r\nits service promising youth, in the hope that they will become\r\ngreat.  Perhaps the last method is the best where it succeeds.\r\nBut the effect of failure is most mischievous.  Presidents\r\nQuincy, Everett, Walker and Sparks administered in succession\r\nthe office of President during my connection with the Academic\r\nDepartment and the Law School, although Dr. Walker's inauguration\r\nwas not until later.  Each of them in his own way was among\r\nthe first men of his time.  Quincy had been an eminent statesman,\r\na famous orator, and a most successful mayor of Boston.  Edward\r\nEverett had been in his early youth one of the most famous\r\npulpit orators of the country, afterward a distinguished\r\nMember of Congress, Governor of the Commonwealth, Minister\r\nto England, and Senator of the United States.  He was a consummate\r\norator, on whose lips thousands and thousands of his countrymen\r\nhad hung entranced.  He was, what is less generally remembered\r\nnow, perhaps the ablest and most accomplished diplomatist\r\never in the public service of the United States.  Jared Sparks\r\nwas a profound student of history, somewhat dull as a narrator,\r\nbut of unerring historic judgment.  I suppose he would be\r\nplaced by all our writers of history with great unanimity\r\nat the head of American historic investigators.  James Walker\r\nwas a great preacher and a profound thinker.  In the judgment\r\nof his hearers, young and old, he was probably deemed nearly\r\nor quite the foremost of American preachers.\r\n\r\nThat I may not be supposed to imply any disparagement of the\r\npresent accomplished head of Harvard, let me say that while\r\neach of the men I have named had done a great work in life\r\nand achieved a great fame before he came to the Presidency,\r\nPresident Eliot has, in my opinion, achieved an equal fame\r\nand performed an equal work since he came to it.\r\n\r\nA like policy prevailed in those days in the choice of instructors\r\nin the Law School.  Judge Story, the senior professor, died\r\njust before I graduated from the College.  His fame as a jurist\r\nwas known throughout Europe.  He was undoubtedly the most\r\nlearned judge in the United States.  Chief Justice Marshall\r\nand Chief Justice Shaw of Massachusetts doubtless excelled\r\nhim in intellectual vigor.  Chancellor Kent rivalled him as\r\na writer upon law.  But he had no other rival among judges\r\nor commentators in this country,--few anywhere.  He was unquestionably,\r\nat the time of his death, the most famous teacher of law in\r\nthe civilized world.  His associate professor, Greenleaf,\r\nwas an admirable lawyer, who, before he went to Harvard, had\r\nhad a great practice in Maine, and made some good arguments\r\nin the Supreme Court of the United States.  Judge Story was\r\nsucceeded by Chief Justice Joel Parker of New Hampshire, a\r\nvery eminent jurist, who was saturated with the old learning\r\nof special pleading and real property.  He would have been\r\na fit associate for Coke or Saunders, and would have held\r\nhis own anywhere with either.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the teaching of Latin or Greek to inspire\r\nthe student with any love of Greek or Latin literature.  The\r\nprofessor never pointed out its beauties or illustrated the\r\ntext in any way.  The students, in succession, were called\r\nupon to construe a few lines, reading one or two Greek words\r\nand then giving their English equivalents.  The time of the\r\ngood scholar was taken up in hearing the recitation of the\r\npoor scholar and so very largely wasted.  I had four or five\r\npersons in my class who became afterward eminent classical\r\nscholars.  I do not believe that when we graduated there were\r\nmore than four men in the class who could write a decent Latin\r\nsentence without the laborious use of grammar and dictionary.\r\nI doubt whether there was more than one, certainly there were\r\nnot more than three, who could do the same thing in Greek.\r\nI do not suppose there was a man in the class who could have\r\nspoken either language with ease.\r\n\r\nYet, somehow, the graduates of Harvard got a good intellectual\r\ntraining from the University.  The rough country boy, if he\r\nhad it in him, came out at his graduation a gentleman in behavior\r\nand in character.  He was able to take hold of life with great\r\nvigor.  The average age of graduation I suppose was twenty.\r\nNot more than three years were spent in studying a profession.\r\nIn some few cases, the graduate got a little money by teaching\r\nfor a year.  But the graduates of Harvard College and Harvard\r\nLaw School were apt to take quite rapidly the high places\r\nof the profession.  That was true then much more than it is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThere were many persons who graduated before my time or shortly\r\nafterward whose high place in the public life of the Commonwealth\r\nand of the country was assured before they were thirty years\r\nold.  Edward Everett was called to the pulpit of Brattle Street\r\nChurch at the age of nineteen.  He succeeded in that pulpit\r\nJoseph Stevens Buckminster, who was himself settled over that\r\nimportant parish at the age of twenty-one and was a wonderful\r\npulpit orator.  Edward Everett preached a sermon when he was\r\ntwenty-four years old before a large audience in the Representatives\r\nChamber at Washington which was heard with breathless silence.\r\nRufus King said it was the best sermon he ever heard, and\r\nHarrison Gray Otis was affected to tears.  Benjamin R. Curtis\r\nwas admitted to the bar in Boston when he was twenty-two years\r\nold and shortly after was retained in a very important case.\r\nIt is said that an old deputy sheriff, who had just heard\r\nCurtis's opening argument, was met in the street and asked\r\nif anything was going on in court.  \"Going on?\" was the reply.\r\n\"There's a young chap named Curtis up there has just opened\r\na case so that all Hell can't close it.\"  I suppose Edward\r\nEverett Hale and James Freeman Clarke were almost as famous\r\nin the pulpit when they were twenty-five or twenty-six years\r\nold as they ever were afterward.  I might extend the catalogue\r\nindefinitely.  Where is there to be found to-day at the New\r\nEngland bar or in the New England pulpit a man under thirty\r\nof whom it can be said that his place among the great men\r\nof his profession is assured? It will not do to say in answer\r\nto this that it takes a greater man in this generation to\r\nfill such a place than it took in other days.  That is not\r\ntrue.  The men of those generations have left their work behind\r\nthem.  It does not suffer in comparison with that of their\r\nsuccessors.  There was something in the college training of\r\nthat day, imperfect as were its instruments, and slender as\r\nwere its resources, from which more intellectual strength\r\nin the pupil was begotten than there is in the college training\r\nof the present generation.  I will not undertake to account\r\nfor it.  But I think it was due in large part to the personality\r\nof the instructors.  A youth who contemplated with a near\r\nand intimate knowledge the large manhood of Josiah Quincy;\r\nwho listened to the eloquence of James Walker, or heard his\r\nexpositions of the principal systems of ethics or metaphysics;\r\nor who sat at the feet of Judge Story, as he poured forth\r\nthe lessons of jurisprudence in a clear and inexhaustible\r\nstream, caught an inspiration which transfigured the very\r\nsoul of the pupil.\r\n\r\nJosiah Quincy, \"old Quin\" as we loved to call him, was a very\r\nsimple and a very high character.  He was born in Boston,\r\nFebruary 4, 1772, just before the Revolutionary War.  It was\r\nsaid, I have no doubt truly, that the nurse who attended his\r\nmother at his birth went from that house to the wife of Copley,\r\nthe painter, when her son, Lord Lyndhurst, was born.  Copley\r\nwas a Tory, though a patriot and an ardent lover of his country.\r\nHis departure from Boston made Lord Lyndhurst an Englishman.\r\nQuincy entered early into politics.  He was a candidate for\r\nCongress in the last century before he was twenty-five years\r\nold.  I heard him say once that the Democrats called for a\r\ncradle to rock the Federal candidate.  He was a good type\r\nof the old Massachusetts Federalist,--brave, manly, sincere,\r\nof a broad and courageous statesmanship, but distrustful of\r\nthe people and not understanding their temper.  He made some\r\nvery powerful speeches in the House of Representatives, attacking\r\nthe greed and office-seeking of that time.  His eloquence\r\nwas something of the style of the famous Irish orators.  One\r\nof his passages describing the office-seekers tumbling over\r\neach other like pigs to a trough will be long remembered.\r\nHe hated Jefferson and moved his impeachment in the House\r\nof Representatives,--a motion for which he got no vote but\r\nhis own.  He retired disgusted from National public life,\r\nbecame Mayor of Boston, an office which he filled with much\r\ndistinction, and then was called to the Presidency of Harvard,\r\nmainly because of his business capacity.  The finances of\r\nthe University were then in a sad condition.  He put them\r\non an excellent footing.  He was very fond of the boys and\r\nthey of him, although he was rough and hasty in his manners.\r\nWhile I was in college (although I happened to be at home\r\nthat day and did not see the affair) some of the boys had\r\ngot into some serious rows in Boston one Saturday.  They had\r\nundertaken to wear the Oxford cap and gown.  They were ridiculed\r\nby the populace in Boston, and a good many fights were the\r\nconsequence.  They were driven from the streets, and in the\r\nafternoon a lot of roughs took hold of a long rope, as if\r\nthey belonged to an engine company, ran out to Cambridge across\r\nthe bridge, and proposed to attack the college buildings.\r\nOld Quin gathered the students together at the gate and told\r\nthe boys to keep within the yard and not to attack anybody\r\nunless they were attacked, but to permit none of those men\r\nto come within the gate.  The old fellow was ready to head\r\nthe students and a fight was expected.  But the police gathered,\r\nand finally the Boston roughs were persuaded to depart in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman's heart always warmed to the son of an old\r\nFederalist.  I had to visit his study a good many times, I\r\nregret to say, to receive some well-deserved admonitions.\r\nBut the interview always ended in an inquiry after my father\r\nand some jolly, or at least kindly utterance about myself.\r\nOne of my classmates gave an account in rhyme of one of these\r\ninterviews which I wish I could repeat.  I can only remember\r\ntwo lines:\r\n\r\n  Quin deigned a grin, perforce,\r\n  And Hoar a roar, of course.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1864 at the age of ninety-two, preserving to the\r\nlast his mental vigor and his ardent interest in public affairs.\r\nDuring the darkest period of the War he never lost his hope\r\nor faith.  He fell on the ice and broke his hip a little while\r\nbefore his death.  He was treated by the somewhat savage\r\nmethod of the surgery of the time.  Dr. George E. Ellis,\r\nfrom whom I had the story, went to see him one day at his\r\nhouse on Park Street and found the old man lying on his bed\r\nwith a weight hanging from his foot, which projected over\r\nthe bed, to keep the bones in their place and the muscles\r\nfrom contracting.  He said to Mr. Quincy's daughter:  \"You\r\nhave been shut up here a long time.  Now go and take a walk\r\nround the Common and let me stay with your father.\" Miss Quincy\r\nwent out and the old man kept Dr. Ellis so full of interest\r\nby his cheerful and lively talk that he never once thought\r\nto ask him how he was getting along.  When Miss Quincy returned,\r\nhe took his leave and had got downstairs when the omission\r\noccurred to him.  He went back to the chamber and said to\r\nMr. Quincy:  \"I forgot to ask you how your leg is.\"  The old\r\nfellow brought his hand down with a slap upon the limb and\r\nsaid:  \"Damn the leg.  I want to see this business settled.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Felton was inaugurated as President, Gov. Banks in performing\r\nhis part of the ceremony of presenting the charter and the\r\nkeys to the new officer alluded in his somewhat grandiloquent\r\nway to four of Felton's predecessors, Everett, Sparks, Walker\r\nand Quincy, who were upon the stage.  Speaking of Quincy he\r\nsaid:  \"He would be reckoned among honorable men, though their\r\nnumber were reduced to that of the mouths of the Nile or the\r\ngates of Thebes.\"\r\n\r\nFelton, the Greek professor, was the heartiest and jolliest\r\nof men.  He was certainly one of the best examples of a fully\r\nrounded scholarship which this country or perhaps any country\r\never produced.  He gave before the Lowell Institute a course\r\nof lectures on Greece Ancient and Modern, into which is compressed\r\nlearning enough to fill a large encyclopaedia.  He also edited\r\ntwo or three Greek plays and an edition of Homer, which was\r\nextensively used as a text-book.\r\n\r\nProfessor Felton was a very impulsive man, though of great\r\ndignity and propriety in his general bearing.  He had some\r\ntheories of his own as to the matter of pure and correct\r\nEnglish and was very much disgusted if anybody transgressed\r\nthem.  His brother, John Felton, of the class of 1847, afterward\r\nthe foremost lawyer on the Pacific Coast, was altogether the\r\nbest and most brilliant scholar in his class.  He was reported\r\nto the Faculty just before his graduation for the offence\r\nof swearing in the College Yard, an offence which was punished\r\nby what was called a public admonition which involved a considerable\r\nloss of rank and a letter to the parent or guardian of the\r\noffender.  The Faculty, in consideration of John Felton's\r\nexcellent scholarship, instead of the ordinary punishment\r\ndirected that Professor Felton should admonish his brother\r\nof his fault in private.  The professor was some eighteen\r\nor twenty years the elder and respected by his brother rather\r\nas a father than as a brother.  He sent for John to his study\r\nand told him the nature of the complaint, and proceeded: \"I\r\ncannot tell you how mortified I am that my brother, in whose\r\ncharacter and scholarship I had taken so much pride, who stood\r\nso high in his class, should have been reported to the Faculty\r\nfor this vulgar and wicked offence.\"  John said, with great\r\ncontrition:  \"I am exceedingly sorry.  It was under circumstances\r\nof great provocation.  I have never been guilty of such a\r\nthing before.  I never in my life have been addicted to profanity.\"\r\n\"Damnation, John,\" interposed the professor, \"how often have\r\nI told you the word is profaneness and not profanity?\"  It\r\nis needless to say that the sermon ended at that point.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting single figure in the Harvard Faculty\r\nin my day was James Walker.  He was a man of quiet dignity,\r\nand of modest bearing.  He appeared rather awkward when he\r\nwalked, as if there were some want of strength in the feet\r\nor ankles.  He heard the classes in my time in Jouffroy and\r\nCousin and in Butler's \"Analogy.\"  His method was to require\r\nthe boy to get into his mind some account of a system or special\r\ncourse of reasoning of the author and to state it at considerable\r\nlength in his own language.  I think all that I got out of\r\ncollege that was of much use to me came from this training\r\nin James Walker's recitation-room, except that I think I got\r\nsome capacity for cross-examining witnesses which was very\r\nuseful to me afterward from reading Plato's dialogues and\r\ngetting familiar with Socrates's method of reducing a sophist\r\nad absurdum.  But Dr. Walker's throne was the pulpit of the\r\nCollege Chapel.  He used to preach four Sundays in each of\r\nthe two terms.  He had a beautiful head, a deep but clear\r\nvoice, a deliberate manner and a power of emphasizing his\r\nweighty thoughts which I have never seen surpassed by any\r\norator.  He had a small and beautiful hand of which it is\r\nsaid, though such a thing is hard to believe of him, he was\r\nsomewhat vain.  But his only gesture was to bring very infrequently\r\nthe back of his hand down upon the cushion of the pulpit before\r\nhim.  The ticking of the clock in the College Chapel was inaudible\r\nwhen the chapel was empty.  But it ticked out clear and loud\r\nupon the strained ears of the auditors who were waiting in\r\nthe pauses of his sentences.  I can remember his sermons now.\r\nThey are admirable to read, although, like other eloquence,\r\ntheir life and sprit is lost without the effect of speech.\r\nThere was one on the text, \"Thou shalt say no,\" which no hearer,\r\nI venture to say, ever forgot to the day of his death.  There\r\nwas another, on the control of the thoughts, from the text,\r\n\"Leading into captivity every thought.\"  This made a deep impression\r\non the students.  I seem to hear the tones of his voice now.\r\nThe Doctor described with a terrific effect the thinking over\r\nin imagination scenes of vice by the youth who seemed to\r\nthe world outside to fall suddenly from virtue.  He said\r\nthere was no such thing as a sudden fall from virtue.  The\r\nscene had been enacted in thought and the man had become\r\nrotten before the time of the outward act.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the novice in crime thinks himself ready to act\r\nwhen he is not; as appears from his hesitancy and reluctance\r\nwhen the moment for action arrives.  If, however, this unexpected\r\nrecoil of his nature does not induce him to change his purpose\r\naltogether, he knows but too well how to supply the defect\r\nin training for sin.  If we could look into his heart, we\r\nshould find him at his accursed rehearsals again.  A few more\r\nlessons, and the blush and the shudder will pass away, never\r\nto return.\"\r\n\r\nThis is tame enough in the recital.  But I dare say there\r\nare old men who will read these pages to whom it will bring\r\nback the never-forgotten scenes of more than fifty years ago.\r\nThe Doctor had a great gift of sententious speech, not only\r\nin his written discourses, but in his ordinary conversation or\r\nhis instruction from the professor's chair.  He was speaking\r\none day of Combe and of something disrespectful he had said\r\nabout the English metaphysicians.  \"What does Mr. Combe mean?\"\r\nsaid the Doctor.  \"I make no apology for the English metaphysicians.\r\nThey have made their mistakes.  They have their shortcomings.\r\nBut they are surely entitled to the common privilege of Englishmen\r\n--to be judged by their peers.\"  He was speaking one day of\r\nsome rulers who had tried to check the rising tide of some\r\nreform by persecuting its leaders.  \"Fools!\" said the Doctor.\r\n\"They thought if they could but wring the neck of the crowing\r\ncock it would never be day.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the delightful characters and humorists connected\r\nwith Harvard was Evangelinus Apostolides Sophocles, tutor\r\nin Greek.  He was a native of Thessaly, born near Mount Pelion\r\nand educated in the convent of the Greek Church on Mount Sinai.\r\nIt is said, although such instances are rare, that he was\r\nof the purest Greek blood.  At any rate, his face and head\r\nwere of the Greek type.  He was a man of wonderful learning,\r\n--I dare say the best Greek scholar of his generation, whether\r\nin Europe or America.  He was a very simple-hearted person\r\nin dealing with ordinary affairs.  But his conversation and\r\nhis instruction in the class-room were full of wit and sense.\r\nHe used to tell a story, whether of his father or his grandfather\r\nI am not sure, that one night very late he was sitting in\r\nhis warehouse alone when two men entered and told him they\r\nwere come to kill him.  He asked them why they wished to kill\r\nhim, and they told him that they had been hired by an enemy\r\nof his.  \"Well,\" said the old man, \"what are you to be paid?\"\r\nThey told him the sum.  He said:  \"I will give you twice as\r\nmuch to kill him.\"  Accordingly they accepted the offer and\r\nwent away, leaving the old fellow alive, kept their bargain\r\nwith him and killed his enemy.\r\n\r\nSophocles had a great love of little children and a curious\r\nlove of chickens which he treated as pets and liked to tame\r\nand to play with, squatting down on the ground among them\r\nas if he were a rooster himself.  It is said that during his\r\nlast sickness the doctor directed that he should have chicken\r\nbroth.  He indignantly rejected it, and declared he would\r\nnot eat a creature that he loved.\r\n\r\nIn what I have said about Professor Channing I am describing\r\nhim and his method in instruction faithfully as it seemed\r\nto me at the time.  It is quite possible I may be wrong.  I\r\nam sure that the better scholars and the youths who were much\r\nbetter in every way than I was at that time of my life who\r\nwere his pupils will dissent from my opinion and be shocked\r\nat what I say.  So it is quite likely that I am in fault and\r\nnot he.  I have read again lately his book on Rhetoric and\r\nOratory since what I said a little while ago was dedicated,\r\nand I wish to reaffirm my high opinion of the book.  For fresh,\r\nracy and correct style, for clear perception and exquisite\r\nliterary taste, it is one of the best books on the subject,\r\nas it one of the best books on any subject ever written by\r\nan American.  His mistake was, in large measure, the prevalent\r\nmistake of the College in his time,--the use of ridicule and\r\nseverity instead of sympathy as a means of correcting the\r\nfaults incident to youth.  It was the fault of the College,\r\nboth of instructors and of the students.  Dr. Walker in one\r\nof his public addresses speaks with commendation of \"the storm\r\nof merciless ridicule\" which overwhelms young men who are\r\naddicted to certain errors which he is criticising.\r\n\r\nThe Latin professor was Charles Beck, Ph.D.  He was a native\r\nof Heidelberg.  He had been compelled to leave Prussia because\r\nof his love of liberty.  He had studied theology, and had\r\npublished a treatise on gymnastics, in which he was accomplished.\r\nWe read with him Terence and Plautus, the Medea of Seneca,\r\nHorace, and probably some Latin prose, which I have forgotten.\r\nHe was a very learned Latin scholar.  I do not know whether\r\nhe cared anything about poetry or eloquence or the philosophy\r\nof the Roman authors or no.  Certainly he did nothing to indicate\r\nto us that he had any such interest or to stimulate any such\r\ninterest in his pupils.  He was strict to harshness in dealing\r\nwith his class.  The only evidence of enthusiasm I ever witnessed\r\nin Dr. Beck was this:  He brought into the classroom one day\r\nan old fat German with very dirty hands and a dirty shirt.\r\nHe had a low forehead and a large head with coarse curling\r\nhair which looked as if it had not seen a comb or brush for\r\na quarter of a century.  We looked with amazement at this\r\nfigure.  He went out before the recitation was over.  But\r\nDr. Beck said to us:  \"This is Dr. ----, gentlemen.  He is\r\na most admiwable scholar.\"  (This was the Doctor's pronunciation\r\nof the r.)  \"He has wead Cicewo through every year for nearly\r\nfifty years for the sake of settling some important questions.\r\nHe has discovered that while necesse est may be used indifferently\r\neither with the accusative and infinitive, or with ut with\r\nthe subjunctive, necesse ewat can only be used before ut with\r\nthe subjunctive.  I should think it well worth living for\r\nto have made that discovery.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose we all thought when we graduated that Dr. Beck\r\nwas a man of harsh and cold nature.  But I got acquainted\r\nwith him later in life and found him one of the most genial\r\nand kind-hearted of men.  He was a member of the Legislature.\r\nHe was a Free Soiler and an Abolitionist, liberally contributing\r\nto the Sanitary Commission, and to all agencies for the benefit\r\nof the soldiers and the successful prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nHe came vigorously to the support of Horace Mann in his famous\r\ncontroversy with Mr. Webster.  Mann had vigorously attacked\r\nWebster, and Webster in return had spoken of Mann as one of\r\nthat class of persons known among the Romans as Captatores\r\nVerborum, which he supposed to mean one of those nice persons\r\nwho catch up other person's words for the sake of small criticism\r\nand fault-finding.  Mr. Mann replied that Webster was wrong\r\nin his Latin, and the words Captatores Verborum meant toad-\r\neaters, or men who hang on the words of great men to praise\r\nand flatter them, of which he found some conspicuous modern\r\nexamples among Webster's supporters.  Professor Felton, the\r\nGreek professor, who was a staunch friend of Webster, attacked\r\nMann and charged him with ignorance of Latin.  But Dr. Beck\r\ncame to the rescue, and his authority as a Latin scholar\r\nwas generally conceded to outweigh that of Webster and Felton\r\nput together.\r\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant men among the Faculty was Professor\r\nBenjamin Peirce.  Undoubtedly he was the foremost American\r\nmathematician of his time.  He dwelt without a companion in\r\nthe lofty domain of the higher mathematics.\r\n\r\n  A privacy of glorious light is thine.\r\n\r\nHe was afterward the head of the Coast Survey.  He had little\r\nrespect for pupils who had not a genius for mathematics,\r\nand paid little attention to them.  He got out an edition\r\nof Peirce's Algebra while I was in college.  He distributed\r\nthe sheets among the students and would accept, instead of\r\na successful recitation, the discovery of a misprint on its\r\npages.  The boys generally sadly neglected his department,\r\nwhich was made elective, I think, after the sophomore year.\r\nAt the examinations, which were held by committees appointed\r\nby the Board of Overseers, he always gave to the pupil the\r\nsame problem that had been given to him in the last preceding\r\nrecitation.  So the boys were prepared to make a decent appearance.\r\nHe used to dress in a very peculiar fashion, wearing a queer\r\nlittle sack and striped trousers which made him look sometimes\r\nas if he were a salesman in a Jew clothing-store.  He had\r\na remarkably clear and piercing black eye.  One night one\r\nof the students got into the belfry and attached a slender\r\nthread to the tongue of the bell, contrived to lock the door\r\nwhich led to the tower and carry off the key, then went to\r\nhis room in the fourth story of Massachusetts Hall and began\r\nto toll the bell.  The students and the Faculty and proctors\r\ngathered, but nobody could explain the mysterious ringing\r\nof the bell until Peirce came upon the scene.  His sharp eye\r\nperceived the slender line and it was traced to the room where\r\nthe roguish fellow who was doing the mischief thought himself\r\nsecure.  He was detected and punished.\r\n\r\nPeirce gained great fame in the scientific world by his controversy\r\nwith Leverrier.  Leverrier, as is well known, discovered some\r\nperturbations in the movement of the planet Herschel, now\r\nmore commonly called Uranus, which were not accounted for\r\nby known conditions.  From that he reasoned that there must\r\nbe another planet in the neighborhood and, on turning his\r\nglass to the point where his calculations told him the disturbing\r\nbody must be, he discovered the planet sometimes called by\r\nhis name and sometimes called Neptune.  This discovery created\r\na great sensation and a burst of admiration for the fortunate\r\ndiscoverer.  Peirce maintained the astounding proposition\r\nthat there was an error in Leverrier's calculations, and that\r\nthe discovery was a fortunate accident.  I believe that astronomers\r\nfinally came to his conclusion.  I remember once going into\r\nBoston in the omnibus when Peirce got in with a letter in\r\nhis hand that he had just got from abroad and saying with\r\ngreat exultation to Professor Felton, who happened to be there,\r\n\"Gauss says I am right.\"\r\n\r\nI got well acquainted with Professor Peirce after I left\r\nCollege.  He used to come to Washington after I came into\r\npublic life.  I found him one of the most delightful of men.\r\nHis treatise \"Ideality in the Physical Sciences,\" and one\r\nor two treatises of a religious character which he published,\r\nare full of a lofty and glowing eloquence.  He gave a few\r\nlectures in mathematics to the class which, I believe, were\r\ntotally incomprehensible to every one of his listeners with\r\nthe possible exception of Child.  He would take the chalk\r\nin his hand and begin in his shrill voice, \"If we take,\" then\r\nhe would write an equation in algebraic characters, \"thus\r\nwe have,\" following it by another equation or formula.  By\r\nthe time he had got his blackboard half covered, he would\r\nget into an enthusiasm of delight.  He would rub the legs\r\nof his pantaloons with his chalky hands and proceed on his\r\nlofty pathway, apparently unconscious of his auditors.  What\r\nhas become of all those wonderful results of genius I do not\r\nknow.  He was invited to a banquet by the Harvard Alumni in\r\nNew York where he was the guest of honor.  Mr. Choate expressed\r\na grave doubt whether the professor could dine comfortably\r\nwithout a blackboard.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Webster gave lectures to the boys on chemistry and\r\ngeology which they were compelled to attend.  I think the\r\nlatter the most tedious human compositions to which I ever\r\nlistened.  The doctor seemed a kind-hearted, fussy person.\r\nHe was known to the students by the sobriquet of Sky-rocket\r\nJack, owing to his great interest in having some fireworks\r\nat the illumination when President Everett was inaugurated.\r\nThere was no person among the Faculty at Cambridge who seemed\r\nless likely to commit such a bloody and cruel crime as that\r\nfor which he was executed.  The only thing that I know which\r\nindicated insensibility was that when he was lecturing one\r\nday in chemistry he told us that in performing the experiment\r\nwhich he was then showing us a year or two before with some\r\nhighly explosive gas a copper vessel had burst and a part\r\nof it had been thrown with great violence into the back of\r\nthe bench where a row of students were sitting, but fortunately\r\nthe student who sat in that place was absent that day and\r\nnobody was hurt.  He added drily: \"The President sent for\r\nme and told me I must be more careful.  He said I should feel\r\nvery badly indeed if I had killed one of the students.  And\r\nI should.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in my time equivalent to what used to be\r\ncalled a rebellion in the older days, and I believe no such\r\nevent has occurred for the last fifty years.  The nearest\r\nto it was a case which arose in the senior class when I was\r\na freshman.  One of the seniors, who was a rather dull-witted\r\nbut well-meaning youth, concluded that it was his duty to\r\ninform the Faculty of offences committed by his classmates,\r\na proceeding it is needless to say contrary to all the boys'\r\nsentiments as to honorable conduct.  Some windows had been\r\nbroken, including his.  He informed the Faculty of the person\r\nwho had broken them, who was rusticated for a short time as\r\npunishment.  The next day being Saturday, this informer, dressed\r\nup in his best, was starting for Boston, when he was seized\r\nby six of his classmates and held under the College pump until\r\nhe received a sound ducking.  He seized the finger of one\r\nof them with his teeth and bit it severely, though it was protected\r\nsomewhat by a ring.  He complained of five of the six, who\r\nwere forthwith suspended until the next Commencement, losing,\r\nof course, their rank in the class and their chances for taking\r\npart in the Commencement exercises.  One of them, of whom\r\nhe omitted to tell, was much disturbed by the omission and\r\ndemanded of the informer why he left him out.  He said that\r\nhe had rather a pity for him, as he had already been suspended\r\nonce and he supposed the new offence would lead to his being\r\nexpelled.  Whereupon he said, \"I will give you some reason\r\nto tell of me,\" and proceeded to administer a sound caning.\r\nThat was at once reported to the Faculty.  The offender was\r\nexpelled, and criminal proceedings had which resulted in a\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nWe had some delightful lectures from Longfellow on the literature\r\nof the Middle Ages.  He read us some of his own original poems\r\nand some beautiful translations.  All the substance of these\r\nlectures I think is to be found in his book entitled \"The\r\nPoets and Poetry of the Middle Ages.\"  I do not see that we\r\ngained anything of solid instruction by having them read to\r\nus that we could not have got as well by reading them.  We\r\nhad also a course of lectures from Jared Sparks on American\r\nhistory.  They were generally dull and heavy, but occasionally\r\nmade intensely interesting when he described some stirring\r\nevent of the Revolutionary War.  We hung breathless on his\r\naccount of the treason of Arnold and its detection and the\r\nclass burst out into applause when he ended,--a thing the\r\nlike of which never happened in any time in College.  There\r\nwas a little smattering of instruction in modern languages,\r\nbut it was not of much value.  We had a French professor named\r\nViau whom the boys tormented unmercifully.  He spoke English\r\nvery imperfectly, and his ludicrous mistakes destroyed all\r\nhis dignity and rendered it impossible to maintain any discipline\r\nin the class.  He would break out occasionally in despair,\r\n\"Young zhentlemen, you do not respect me and I have not given\r\nyou any reason to.\"  A usual punishment for misconduct in those\r\ndays was to deduct a certain number of the marks which determined\r\nrank from the scale of the offending student.  M. Viau used\r\nto hold over us this threat, which, I believe, he never executed,\r\n\"Young zhentlemen, I shall be obliged to deduce from you.\"\r\n\r\nHe was followed by the Comte de la Porte, a gentleman in bearing\r\nand of a good deal of dignity.  The Count was asked one day\r\nby Nat Perry, a member of the class from New Hampshire who\r\nwas very proud of his native State and always boasting of\r\nthe exploits in war and peace of the people of New Hampshire,\r\nwhat sort of a French scholar M. Viau, his predecessor, was.\r\nThe Count replied:  \"He was not a fit teacher for young gentlemen.\r\nHe was an ignorant person from the Provinces.  He did not\r\nhave the Parisian accent.  He did not know the French language\r\nin its purity.  It would be as if somebody were to undertake\r\nto teach English who came from New Hampshire or some such\r\nplace.\"  The Count said this in entire innocence.  It was\r\nreceived with a roar of laughter by the class, and the indignation\r\nand wrath of Perry may well be imagined.\r\n\r\nAnother instructor in modern languages was Dr. Bachi.  He\r\nwas a very accomplished gentleman.  His translations of Italian\r\npoetry, especially of Dante and Tasso, were exquisite.  It\r\nwas like hearing a sweet and soft music to hear him read his\r\nbeloved poets, and he had a singular gift of getting hold\r\nof the most sweet and mellifluous English words for his rendering.\r\n\"And he did open his mouth, and from it there did come out\r\nwords sweeter than honey.\"  He once translated to us a passage\r\nin the Inferno where the damned are suspended, head downwards,\r\nwith the burning flames resting upon the soles of their feet.\r\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed Bachi, \"they do curl up their toes.\"\r\n\r\nMy class is not one of the very famous classes of the College.\r\nCertainly it does not equal the class of 1802 or the class\r\nof 1829.  But I think it was, on the whole, very considerably\r\nabove the average.  In it were several persons who became\r\neminent scholars and teachers, and some who have been eminent\r\nin other walks of life.  I think, on the whole, its two most\r\ndistinguished members, entitled to hold a greater place than\r\nany others in the memory of future generations, were Dr. Calvin\r\nEllis, Dean of the Medical Faculty of Harvard, who died in\r\n1883, and Judge Nathan Webb, of the United States District\r\nCourt of Maine, who died in 1902.  Neither of these had very\r\nhigh rank in the class.  The first half of the class used\r\nto have parts assigned at Commencement in those days.  Ellis's\r\npart was very nearly the lowest of the first half.  Webb's\r\nwas higher.  Webb entered college very young.  He was quite\r\nsmall in his stature and was known all though college as \"little\r\nWebb.\"  He grew to a stature of about six feet after he left\r\ncollege.  He did, I believe, some very hard work indeed in\r\nhis senior year.  Although universally liked and respected\r\nby his classmates, he was not regarded as among the eminent\r\nscholars.  Ellis performed all his duties in College very fairly\r\nbut did not seem to care much for rank or for scholarship\r\nuntil, in the senior year, some lectures on anatomy were delivered\r\nby old Dr. John C. Warren.  Ellis was filled with enthusiasm,\r\nas were some of the other members of the class.  He and I\r\ngot a skull somewhere and studied bones, processes, and sutures,\r\nboth meaning to be physicians.  My zeal lasted but a few weeks.\r\nEllis's never abated until his death.  He was at the head\r\nof his profession in the country in his own department, became\r\nDean of the Harvard Medical School, and was loved and revered\r\nby his numerous pupils as by the members of his profession.\r\nHe was one of the most simple-hearted, affectionate, spotless\r\nand lovable of men.  He died of a lingering and painful disease,\r\nnever losing his courage and patience, or his devoted interest\r\nin science.  Webb was exceedingly fond of his home, not being\r\nvery ambitious of higher office, but content to discharge\r\nably and faithfully and to the universal satisfaction of the\r\nprofession and the public, the duty of the important place\r\nhe held.  I have seen a good many public men from Maine of\r\nboth parties.  They all unite in this estimate of Judge Webb.\r\nThere is no doubt that if he had been willing he would long\r\nago have been made Judge of the Circuit Court, and then if\r\nthe seat on the Supreme Court of the United States held by\r\nMr. Justice Gray of the New England Circuit had become vacant,\r\nI suppose he would have been called from the Circuit Bench to\r\nthat Court by almost universal consent.\r\n\r\nThree persons, Child, Lane and Short, all very distinguished\r\nscholars in after life, took their place at the head of the\r\nclass in the beginning.  Two of them held the same place when\r\nthey graduated.  Short was outstripped by Edwin Moses Bigelow,\r\nwho is now living, a lawyer, in Boston.  He entered college\r\nfrom the country not so well fitted when he entered as most\r\nof the class.  But he made his way by an indefatigable diligence\r\nuntil he graduated with great distinction, the third scholar,\r\ngoing a little above Short.\r\n\r\nChild was a man of great genius.  He seems to me now, as I\r\nlook back upon him, to have been as great a man at seventeen\r\nwhen he entered college, as he was when he died.  He was the\r\nbest writer, the best speaker and the best mathematician,\r\nthe most accomplished person in his knowledge of general literature\r\nin the class,--indeed, I suppose, in college,--in his day.\r\nHe was probably equalled, and I dare say more lately excelled,\r\nby Lane as a Latin scholar, and by Short as a Greek scholar.\r\nHe was a great favorite with the class.  He spent his life\r\nin the service of the College.  He was tutor for a short time\r\nand soon succeeded Channing as Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory.\r\nHe became one of the most eminent scholars in the country\r\nin early English literature and language.  He edited a collection\r\nof ballads, Little & Brown's edition of the British Poets,\r\nand was a thorough student of Shakespeare and Chaucer.  To\r\nthe elucidation of the text of Chaucer he made some admirable\r\ncontributions.  He was shy and diffident, full of kindness\r\ntoward persons whom he knew and to children, and of sympathy\r\nwith persons who were in sorrow, but whimsical, grotesque,\r\nand apt to take strong prejudices against persons whom he\r\ndid not know.  I suppose some of the best of our American\r\nmen of letters of late years would have submitted their productions\r\nto the criticism of Child as to a master.\r\n\r\nNext to him stood Lane, the learned Latin scholar.  I do\r\nnot believe that anybody ever went through Harvard College\r\nwho performed four years of such constant and strenuous labor.\r\nWhat he did in his vacations I do not know, but there was\r\nno minute lost in the term time.  It is said that he never\r\nmissed attendance on morning and evening prayers but once.\r\nThe class were determined that Lane should not go through\r\ncollege without missing prayers once.  So one night a cord\r\nwas fastened to the handle of his door and attached to the\r\nrail of the staircase.  But Lane succeeded in wrenching open\r\nthe door and got to morning prayers in time.  He was the monitor,\r\nwhose duty it was to mark the students who were absent from\r\nprayers and who were punished for absence by a deduction\r\nfrom their rank and, if the absences were frequent enough,\r\nby a more severe penalty.  The next time the measures were\r\nmore effective.  Lane's chum, Ellis, was in the conspiracy.\r\nThe students bored holes carefully into the door and into\r\nthe jamb by the side and took a quantity of hinges and screwed\r\nthem carefully on to the door and the jamb.  When Lane got\r\nready to start for prayers in the morning, he found it impossible\r\nto open the door.  As soon as he discovered what was the trouble,\r\nhe seized his hatchet and undertook to cut his way out.  His\r\nchum, Ellis, who had remained quietly in bed, sprang out\r\nof bed and placed his back against the door and declared\r\nthat the door of his room should not be hewn down in that\r\nmanner.  Lane was obliged to desist.  He however took his\r\nmonitor's book, marked himself and his chum absent, and submitted.\r\nThere were a good many such pranks played by the boys in those\r\ndays, in the spirit of a harmless and good-natured mischief.\r\nI do not know whether the College has improved in the particular\r\nor no.  I do not think anybody in my day would have defaced\r\nthe statue of John Harvard.\r\n\r\nWhether Lane will go farther down on the path to immortality\r\nas the author of the admirable Latin Grammar to which he gave\r\nso much of his life or as author of the song, \"The Lone Fish\r\nBall,\" posterity alone will determine.\r\n\r\nCharles Short, the third of the three whom I named as standing\r\nat the head of the class, became President of Kenyon College\r\nand afterward Professor of Latin in Columbia College.  He\r\nwas one of the committee to prepare the revised version of\r\nthe Scriptures, and contributed largely to the Harpers' excellent\r\nLatin Dictionary.\r\n\r\nAnother of our famous scholars was Fitzedward Hall, who died\r\nlately in England.  He was a very respectable scholar in the\r\nordinary college studies, but he attained no special distinction\r\nin them as compared with the others whom I have mentioned.\r\nHe became, however, quite early, interested in Arabic and\r\nother Oriental languages, a study which he pursued, I think,\r\nwithout the help of an instructor.  He had a very remarkable\r\ncareer.  After graduating, he sailed for the East Indies with\r\na view to pursue there the study of the Oriental languages\r\nand literature.  He took with him letters of introduction\r\nto influential persons in Calcutta, and, of course, a sufficient\r\nsupply of funds.  But the vessel on which he was a passenger\r\nwas wrecked as it approached the shore.  He got ashore with\r\ndifficulty, drenched with sea-water, having lost his letters\r\nof introduction and of credit, and with no resources but a\r\nfew coins which happened to be in his pockets.  He knew nobody\r\nin Calcutta.  He disliked very much to present himself to\r\nthe persons to whom he had been commended by his friends in\r\nAmerica in that sorry plight with the possibility that he\r\nmight be suspected of being an impostor.  Accordingly, he\r\ndetermined that he would take care of himself.  He walked\r\nabout the street to see what he could find to do.  As he went\r\nalong he saw the sign of the _Oriental Quarterly Review._\r\nHe went in and inquired for the editor and asked him if he\r\nwould accept an article.  The editor said that he would consider\r\nit if it were brought in.  Hall then went out and found a\r\nbookstore.  Going in he spied a copy of Griswold's \"Poets\r\nand Poetry of America.\" With a pencil and some sheets of paper,\r\nhe wrote an article on American literature, filled up with\r\npretty copious extracts.  He took it to the editor of the\r\n_Review_ who paid him for it, I think five pounds, and told\r\nhim that he should be happy to have him make other contributions.\r\nHall supported himself by writing for that review and some\r\nother periodicals published by the same concern until he could\r\nsend home, get new letters of introduction and credit and\r\nsupport himself as a gentleman.  He spent three years in Calcutta\r\nstudying Hindostanee and Persian, and afterward, Bengalee\r\nand Sanscrit.  Later he removed to Benares, where he was appointed\r\nto a tutorship in the Government College.  Then he became\r\nprofessor and afterward Inspector of Schools for Ajmere and\r\nMairwara.  He was in a besieged fort for seven months during\r\nthe Indian Mutiny.  He received the degree of D.C.L. from\r\nOxford in 1860.  He went to London afterward to promote the\r\nelection of Max Mueller as professor at Oxford.  While there\r\nhe was himself made professor of Sanscrit and of Indian jurisprudence\r\nin London University.  I saw him in England, I think in 1871,\r\nwhen he was librarian of the great library of the East India\r\nCompany, having in charge not only a vast library, but the\r\narchives of the East India Company going back beyond the time\r\nof Cromwell.  He showed me many interesting letters and documents\r\nin manuscript of Cromwell, Nelson and other famous persons.\r\nProfessor Edward B. Whitney once told me that with the exception\r\nof Max Mueller he considered Hall the foremost Oriental scholar\r\nin the world.  I suppose Hall would have said the same of\r\nProfessor Whitney.\r\n\r\nHall maintained his sturdy Americanism throughout his long\r\nlife in England.  He was ready at all times to do battle,\r\nin public or in private, when his countrymen were attacked.\r\nI think, in many cases, if he had been at home, he would have\r\nattacked the same things with which the Englishmen found fault.\r\nHe could not bear Ruskin.  He thought he, himself, as an American\r\nhad to endure much contempt and injury from Englishmen because\r\nof Ruskin's bitter and contemptuous speech.  But when we consider\r\nthat he was an American we must admit that England treated\r\nhim very well.  He had, I suppose, the most welcome admission\r\nto all their scientific journals.  In his time he was employed\r\non the very best and most important work done in England\r\nin his line.  He was professor of Hindostanee and of Hindoo\r\nlaw and Indian jurisprudence in King's College in London,\r\nalso of the Sanscrit language and literature, and Indian\r\nhistory and geography.  In April, 1865, he was made Librarian\r\nof the India Office, having in his charge the best collection\r\nof Oriental manuscripts in the world, twenty thousand in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nWhile the catalogues of the libraries show a large number\r\nof books published under his name, he said that the greater\r\npart of his work had been anonymous.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 he wrote to a London magazine:  \"Although I have lived\r\naway from America upwards of forty-six years, I feel to this\r\nhour, that in writing English I am writing a foreign language.\"\r\n\r\nNext in rank to Child, Lane, Bigelow and Short was Judge Soule.\r\nNext to him came George Cheyne Shattuck Choate, one of the\r\nwell-known family of brothers of that name, sons of a Salem\r\nphysician.  Choate became a physician himself.  He was at\r\nthe head of the Massachusetts Institution for the Insane at\r\nTrenton.  He afterward had an establishment of his own near\r\nNew York, where Horace Greeley was under his care.  I saw\r\nlittle of him after we graduated.  But he was nearly or quite\r\nat the head of his department in the country.  It is said\r\nthat his testimony in court involving questions of medical\r\njurisprudence was wonderful for its beauty, its precision\r\nand its profound analysis.\r\n\r\nBut I am inclined to think that the one member of our class\r\nwhose fame will last to remote posterity, a fame which he\r\nwill owe to a single poem, is Walter Mitchell.  He was a\r\nvery bright and accomplished person in college and a great\r\nfavorite with his friends.  He studied law, but afterward\r\ndetermined to become a clergyman and took orders in the Episcopal\r\nChurch.  I have never heard him preach, but I have no doubt\r\nfrom his distinction as a writer and scholar in college that\r\nhe is an excellent preacher.  But his poem of the sea entitled\r\n\"Tacking the Ship off Fire Island\" is one of the most spirited\r\nand perfect of its kind in literature.  You can hear the wind\r\nblow and feel the salt in your hair as you read it.  I once\r\nheard it read by Richard Dana to the Phi Beta Kappa Society\r\nat Harvard, and again by that most accomplished elocutionist,\r\nE. Harlow Russell.  I never read it or hear it without a renewed\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nBut the brightest, raciest, wittiest, liveliest, spunkiest of\r\nall the youths was Daniel Sargent Curtis, one of the race\r\nof that name so well known in Boston for excellence in various\r\ndepartments.  Curtis was the son, I believe, of Thomas B.\r\nCurtis, the merchant, a nephew of Charles P. Curtis, the\r\neminent lawyer, and a cousin of Judge Benjamin R. Curtis.\r\nI do not know what he would not have made of himself if he\r\nhad cultivated his great literary capacity.  Certainly if\r\nhe had performed the promise of his boyhood he would have\r\nbeen one of the foremost men in American literature.  He\r\nstudied law but pretty soon became a banker.  Soon after\r\nhe took up his residence in Italy, where I suppose he is\r\nliving now.  He produced some serious poetry which he read\r\nto some college societies.  I hope for the credit of the class\r\nand for the country and his name he may have done something\r\nin later years which will be given to the world.  It is said,\r\nI know not how truly, that he was for many years a near neighbor\r\nand intimate friend of Browning.  When he was in college and\r\nin the Law School the boys used to enliven all social gatherings\r\nby repeating his good jests as, in later years, the lawyers\r\ndid those of Rufus Choate, or the people in public life in\r\nWashington still later, those of Evarts.  Such things lose\r\nnine-tenths of their flavor in the repetition and nine parts\r\nof the other tenth when they are put in writing.  Curtis was\r\nquite small in stature but he was plucky as a gamecock, and\r\na little dandyish in his dress.  It is said that when he was\r\na freshman, the boys at the Cambridge High School, a good\r\nmany of whom were much bigger than he was, undertook to throw\r\nsnowballs at him one day as he went by.  Whereupon Curtis\r\nmarched up to the biggest boy and told him if another snowball\r\nwere thrown at him he would thrash him and he might pass it\r\nover to the boy who did it.  The result was that Curtis was\r\nnot troubled again.\r\n\r\nYou could not attack or rally him without some bright reply.\r\nHorace Gray, afterward the judge, went shooting one day and\r\nmet Curtis as he was coming back with his gun over West Boston\r\nBridge.  Curtis asked him if he had shot anything.  Gray said,\r\n\"No, nothing but a hawk in Watertown.  I stopped at the Museum\r\nas I came by, and gave it to Agassiz.\" \"I suppose Agassiz\r\nsaid 'Accipter,'\" said Curtis.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Greenleaf resigned his place at the Dane Law\r\nSchool, much to the regret of the students, it was proposed\r\nto secure a likeness of him for the lecture room.  There was\r\nsome discussion whether it should be a bust or a picture,\r\nand if a bust what should be the material.  Curtis said: \"Better\r\nmake it Verd Antique.  That means Old Green.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Beck once required his class each to bring a Latin epigram.\r\nDan Curtis, who was not very fond of work unless it was in\r\nthe line of his own tastes, sent in the following:\r\n\r\n  Fugiunt.  Qui fugiunt?  Galli; tunc moriar contentus.\r\n\r\n\"What is that, Curtis?\" said the Doctor.  \"Dying words of\r\nWolfe, sir,\" replied Curtis.  \"Ah,\" said the Doctor with\r\ngreat satisfaction.  He thought it was Wolf the famous Greek\r\nscholar, and thought the epigram highly to Curtis's credit.\r\n\r\nI have still in my memory a very bright poem of his.  I do\r\nnot think I ever saw or read it written or in print.  But\r\nI remember hearing it read in one of the college clubs more\r\nthan fifty years ago.  He has Longfellow's style very happily,\r\nincluding the dropping from a bright and sometimes a sublime\r\nline to one which is flat and commonplace, as for instance\r\nin the ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\n  Meantime without the surly cannon waited,\r\n  The sky gleamed overhead.\r\n  Nothing in Nature's aspect indicated\r\n  That a great man was dead.\r\n\r\nThis is Curtis's poem:\r\n\r\n  Wrapped in musing dim and misty,\r\n  Sit I by the fitful flame;\r\n  And my thoughts steal down the vista\r\n  Of old time, as in a dream.\r\n\r\n  Here the hero held his quarters,\r\n  Whom America holds dear;\r\n  He beloved of all her daughters,\r\n  Formerly resided here.\r\n\r\n  Here you often might have seen him,\r\n  Silvery white his reverend scalp,\r\n  Frowned above a mighty chapeau\r\n  Like a storm-cap o'er the Alp.\r\n\r\n  Up and down these rooms the hero\r\n  Oftentimes would thoughtful stray,\r\n  Walking now toward the window,\r\n  Stalking then again away.\r\n\r\n  By the fireside, quaintly moulded\r\n  Oft his humid boots would lie;\r\n  And his queer surtout was folded\r\n  On some strange old chair to dry.\r\n\r\n  In the yard where now before me\r\n  Underclothes, wind-wafted hang\r\n  Waved the banners of an army;\r\n  Warriors strode with martial clang.\r\n\r\n  These things now are all departed,\r\n  With us on the earth no more,\r\n  But the chieftain, noble-hearted,\r\n  Comes to visit me once more.\r\n\r\n  In he comes without permission,\r\n  Sits him down before mine eyes,\r\n  Then I tremble and demnition\r\n  Curious thoughts within me rise.\r\n\r\n  Slow he speaks in accents solemn,\r\n  Life is all an empty hum,\r\n  Man, by adulation only\r\n  Can'st thou ever great become.\r\n\r\nI ought perhaps to mention a young man of most brilliant\r\npromise, an excellent scholar and a great favorite, who died\r\nbefore the class graduated, on a voyage to the East Indies\r\nwhich he undertook in the hope of restoring his health,--\r\nAugustus Enoch Daniels.  He left behind him one _bon mot_\r\nwhich is worth recording.  We were translating one day one\r\nof the choruses in AEschylus, I think in the Agamemnon, where\r\nthe phrase occurs [Greek omitted], meaning \"couches unvisited\r\nby the wind,\" which he most felicitously rendered \"windlass\r\nbedsteads.\"  Such is the vanity of human life that it is not\r\nuncommon that some hardworking, faithful and bright scholar\r\nis remembered only for one single saying, as Hamilton in the\r\nHouse of Commons was remembered for his single speech.  Another\r\ninstance of this is that worthy and excellent teacher of Latin\r\nand Professor of History, Henry W. Torrey.  He was an instructor\r\nin college in our time, afterward left the college to teach\r\na young ladies' school and came back again later as a Professor.\r\nI presume if any member of the class of 1846 were asked about\r\nTorrey he would say: \"Oh, yes.  He was an excellent Latin\r\nscholar, an excellent teacher in elocution and in history.\r\nBut all I remember of him is that on one occasion a man who\r\nprofessed to be learned in Egyptian antiquities advertised a\r\ncourse of lectures, one of which was to be illustrated by\r\nunrolling from a mummy the bandages which had been untouched\r\nsince its interment, many centuries before Christ.  The savant\r\nclaimed to be able to read the inscription on the cloth in\r\nwhich the mummy was wrapped and declared that it was the corpse\r\nof an Egyptian princess, whose name and history he related.\r\nHaving given this narrative and excited the expectation of\r\nhis auditors, the wrappers were taken off and, alas, it turned\r\nout to be the body of a man.  The poor professor was, of course,\r\nmuch disconcerted and his lectures, I believe, came to a sudden\r\nending.  Mr. Torrey said that 'it was undoubtedly the corpse\r\nof Spurius Mummius.'\"\r\n\r\nBut no account of my class ought to omit the name of Henry\r\nWhitney.  He was a universal favorite.  In all the disputes\r\nwhich arose in all the divisions of sets or sections, Whitney\r\nmaintained the regard and affection of the whole class.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating he was a very successful and influential\r\nbusiness man in Boston and was President of the Boston &\r\nProvidence Railroad, which under his masterly administration,\r\nattained a very high degree of prosperity.  I think he corresponded\r\nwith every member of the class, and did more to preserve and\r\ncreate a kindly class feeling than any other member.  It seemed\r\nwhen he died as if half the college had died.  He was a man\r\nof great refinement and scholarship, and was fond of collecting\r\nrare books.  He had a great many editions of Milton which\r\nhe liked to exhibit to his friends.  He had a most delightful\r\nwit, and was the author of some very good songs and other\r\nhumorous poetry.\r\n\r\nI do not of course undertake to give sketches of all my classmates,\r\neither the living or the dead, or those who have attained\r\ndistinction as useful and honorable members of society.  So\r\nfar as I know their career since they left college, there\r\nis none of them of whom the class or the college need be ashamed.\r\n\r\nThe different classes had not much intercourse with each\r\nother unless it happened in the case of boys who came from\r\nthe same town, or who came from the same school, until late\r\nin the college course, when the members of the Hasty Pudding\r\nClub and the Porcellian, the two principal secret societies,\r\nformed intimacies beyond their own class in the meetings\r\nof those clubs.  There were some persons in the classes near\r\nmine, both below and above me, with whom I had an acquaintance\r\nin college which grew into a cordial friendship in the Law\r\nSchool or in later life.  Perhaps, taking him all together,\r\nthe most brilliant man in Harvard in my time was John Felton.\r\nHe went to California and became afterward unquestionably\r\nthe greatest lawyer they have ever had on the Pacific Coast.\r\nHe was in the class after mine.  I knew him slightly in our\r\nundergraduate days.  But when I went to the Law School in\r\nSeptember, 1847, we boarded together in the same house.  We\r\nspeedily became intimate and used to take long walks together\r\nof three or four hours every day.  We rambled about Watertown\r\nand Brighton and Somerville and West Cambridge and had long\r\ndiscussions about law and politics and poetry and metaphysics\r\nand literature and our own ambitions and desires.  We were\r\nconstantly in each other's rooms, and often sat up together,\r\nsometimes until the constellations set, with the wasteful,\r\ntime-consuming habits of boyhood.\r\n\r\n  Say, for you saw us, ye immortal lights,\r\n  How oft, unwearied, have we spent the nights\r\n  In search of deep philosophy,\r\n  Wit, eloquence and poetry,--\r\n  Arts which I loved, for they, my friend, were thine.\r\n\r\nJohn came of a distinguished family.  His brother Cornelius\r\nwas a famous Greek professor, one of the most striking figures\r\nabout Cambridge.  Another brother was Samuel M. Felton, the\r\nmost distinguished civil engineer in the country of his time;\r\nbuilder of the Fitchburg railroad, afterward builder and President\r\nof the Pennsylvania Railroad; the man who conceived the plan\r\nof getting the New England troops into Washington by the way\r\nof Annapolis when Baltimore was in the power of the Rebels.\r\nAnother brother was quite distinguished in college in the\r\nclass of 1851.  John after he graduated went to California\r\nand never came back from the Pacific Coast or kept up his\r\ncommunication with his old friends, although he received them\r\nwith great hospitality, I am told, when they went out there.\r\nI think he had a fancy that he would keep to himself until\r\nhe could come back in some great place, like that of Senator\r\nor Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.  He was\r\na candidate for the Senate at one time, but was defeated by\r\na much inferior man.  He was fond of argument; never was\r\ncontented without challenging somebody and was a very tough\r\ncustomer to encounter, whatever side of a question he chose\r\nto take.  He liked, however, nothing better than a sturdy\r\nresistance.  To yield to him was never the way to win his\r\ngood will.  The first day when we went to live at the same\r\nboarding-house, I got into a hot dispute with him at dinner\r\nover the Wilmot Proviso, and the constitutional power of Congress\r\nto legislate against slavery in the territories, which was\r\nthen a burning question.  John took the Southern side of that\r\nquestion, although I dare say he would have taken the other\r\nif a Southerner had introduced it, and we got pretty zealous\r\non both sides and walked home together continuing the argument\r\nas we walked.  As we separated, Felton said: \"We will continue\r\nthis discussion to-morrow.  Meantime, won't you look up the\r\nhistory of the matter a little?\"  \"Yes,\" said I, \"and won't\r\nyou study up a little on Whately's Logic?\"  The answer seemed\r\nto delight Felton, and he took me into high favor.  I never\r\nknew a man of such ready wit, although I have known a good\r\nmany famous wits in my day.  But all these things evaporate\r\nwith time.  Or, if you remember them, they are vapid and tasteless\r\nin the telling, like champagne which has been uncorked for\r\na week.  We were one day discussing some question of law at\r\nthe table, and John, who had not yet begun to study law himself,\r\nput in his oar as usual, when Charles Allen, afterward Judge\r\nof the Massachusetts Supreme Court, turned on him with some\r\nindignation.  \"What do you know about it, Johnny? You don't\r\nknow what a quantum meruit is.\" \"If you had it, 't would kill\r\nyou,\" said Felton.  He was invited to the dinner given by\r\nthe people of Nevada in honor of their admission as a State,\r\nand there was some discussion about a device for a State\r\nseal.  Felton suggested that the Irish emblem would be the\r\nmost appropriate, the \"Lyre and shamrock.\"  Once after deciding\r\na case in his favor, Mr. Justice Field said to him: \"Felton,\r\nI have made great use of your brief in my opinion.\" \"Always\r\ndo that, Judge,\" said Felton.  He possessed considerable capacity\r\nfor poetry, although I do not know that he cultivated it much\r\nafter he left college.  He delivered a very successful poem\r\nat Commencement, and gave the Phi Beta Kappa poem the next\r\nyear and read some very witty verses at the Society's dinner\r\nthe same day.  He was much distressed over choosing a subject,\r\nand put off and put off writing his poem till within a few\r\ndays of the time when it was to be delivered.  And he finally\r\nresolved, in a fit of desperation, that he would go into his\r\nroom, shut his eyes, turn round three times and take for his\r\nsubject the first object on which they rested when he opened\r\nthem.  That happened to be a horseshoe which he had picked\r\nup in the street and hung over his fireplace for luck.  He\r\nmade a charming poem from this subject, on Superstition.  The\r\nopening lines are:\r\n\r\n  Just over the way, with its front to the street,\r\n  Up one flight of stairs, is a room snug and neat,\r\n  With a prospect Mark Tapley right jolly would call;--\r\n  Two churches, one graveyard, one bulging brick wall,\r\n  Where, raven-like, Science gloats over its wealth,\r\n  And the skeleton grins at the lectures on health.\r\n  The tree by the window has twice hailed the Spring\r\n  Since we circled its trunk our last chorus to sing.\r\n  Maidens laughed at our shouts, they knew better than we;\r\n  And the world clanked its chains as we cried, \"We are free.\"\r\n  On the wall hangs a Horseshoe I found in the street;\r\n  'Tis the shoe that to-day sets in motion my feet\r\n  'Tis a comfort, while Europe to freedom awoke\r\n  Is peeping like chickens just free from their yolk\r\n  To think Pope and Monarch their kingdoms may lose;\r\n  Yet I hang my subject wherever I choose.\r\n\r\nHe goes on in a more serious strain to sketch the history\r\nof superstition and ends with an eloquent aspiration for a\r\nday of universal peace:\r\n\r\n  As now my thoughts like clustering bees have clung\r\n  To thee, my Horseshoe, o'er the lintel hung,\r\n  The future bard, with song more richly fraught,--\r\n  Some reverenced wrong the nucleus of his thought,\r\n  Some relic crown or virtuoso's gun,\r\n  Some nation's banner when all earth is one,--\r\n  Back through the past in mournful strain shall wind\r\n  Where demon fancies vex the darkling mind,\r\n  Where light but faintly streaks the dappled sky,\r\n  Nor Morn has shot his glittering shafts on high;\r\n  Trembling with grief and hope, his lyre shall thrill\r\n  To twilight times of blending good and ill,\r\n  Where whizz of bullets, and the clanking chain,\r\n  Jar on the praise of Peace and Freedom's reign.\r\n  In louder strains shall burst the exulting close,\r\n  That sounds the triumph o'er the struggling foes,--\r\n  The slave unbound, War's iron tongues all dumb,--\r\n  His glorious Present, our all hail To Come,\r\n  All hail To Come, when East and West shall be--\r\n  While rolls between the undividing sea--\r\n  Two, like the brain, whose halves ne'er think apart,\r\n  But beat and tremble to one throbbing heart!\r\n\r\nHe took what was then an unusual method of making himself\r\na good lawyer.  That was to begin to deal with a legal principle\r\nin historic order, going back to the first case where it was\r\nannounced and tracing it down through the reports, making\r\nno use of text-books.  That was the way the old lawyers before\r\nBlackstone got their training.  I have been told, though that\r\nhappened after I left Cambridge, that he and Professor Langdell,\r\nthe eminent teacher at Harvard who had introduced that method\r\nwith so much success, studied together.  Whether it was Felton's\r\nplan or Langdell's I do not know.\r\n\r\nJohn Felton died suddenly in May, 1877.  Everybody who comes\r\nto Washington from California who is old enough speaks with\r\npleasure of his knowledge of Felton and is full of stories\r\nof his brilliant wit.  He had probably the largest fees ever\r\nreceived by an American lawyer.  He is said by his biographer\r\nto have received a fee of a million dollars in one case.  His\r\ndeath was received with universal sorrow.  All the places\r\nof business and amusement were closed and the flags displayed\r\nat half mast on the day of his funeral.\r\n\r\nAnother rather interesting figure among the men of the classes\r\nabove me was Thomas Hill, afterward President of the College.\r\nHe was a good mathematician and a good preacher.  But he was\r\nnot as successful in the Presidency as his friends hoped.\r\nThe only thing I remember about him of any importance is highly\r\nto his credit.  One winter's day a little gaunt-looking and\r\nunhappy pig that had strayed away from a drove wandered into\r\nthe College Yard just as the boys were coming out of evening\r\nprayers.  The whole surface of the yard was covered with a\r\nsheet of thin and very slippery ice.  It was rather hard to\r\nstand up on it.  The boys came across the pig, which was frightened\r\nand attempted to run.  After running a little, he would slip\r\non the ice and slide and tumble over, and then gather himself\r\nup again and try once more.  There was a general shout and\r\na general chase.  Poor piggy strove to elude his pursuers.\r\nHis own tail was a little slippery, so that if a boy caught\r\nit he did not hold it long.  The whole college, pretty much,\r\nengaged in the pursuit, which certainly seemed to be great\r\nfun.  But, on a sudden, there was a loud, angry shout from\r\na stentorian voice as Tom Hill jumped in among the pursuers,\r\nwho were just on the point of conquering the bewildered animal.\r\n\"For shame.  Take one of your size.\" The boys saw the point,\r\nwere filled with mortification, desisted, and allowed the\r\npoor creature to go in peace.\r\n\r\nThe boys generally boarded in the College Commons, where they\r\ncould board for $2.25 a week on one side, and on the other\r\ncalled \"starvation commons\" for $1.75 a week.  In the latter\r\nthey had meat only every other day.  A few of the sons of\r\nthe wealthier families boarded in private houses where the\r\nrate of board varied from $3 to $3.50 a week.  The rooms were\r\nfurnished very simply, almost always without carpets, though\r\nin rare instances the floors would be covered with a cheap\r\ncarpet which did not last very well under the wear and tear\r\nof boyish occupation.  The students generally made their own\r\nfires and blacked their own boots and drew their own water.\r\nBut there was a family of negroes named Lewis who performed\r\nthose services for such boys as desired, at a compensation\r\nof $5 or $6 a term.  The patriarch of this race was a very\r\ninteresting old character.  He was said to be one hundred\r\nyears old.  He was undoubtedly very near it.  One morning,\r\njust as we were coming out of the morning prayers, shortly\r\nafter six o'clock, old Mr. Lewis drove by with a horse which\r\nhe was said to have bought for $5, and a wagon of about the\r\nsame value.  He had a load of all sorts of vegetables which\r\nhe had raised in his little garden near where the Arsenal\r\nstood and was carrying into Boston to market.  One of his\r\nold wheels broke and the wagon came down, spilling the old\r\nfellow himself and his load of vegetables.  He lay there flat\r\non his back, unable to get up, surrounded by turnips and\r\nsquashes and onions and potatoes, etc.  As he lay with his\r\nblack face and his white, grizzled poll, he was a most ludicrous\r\nspectacle.  One of us asked him:  \"Why, Mr. Lewis, what is\r\nthe matter?\"  \"Well,\" he said with a mournful tone, \"I laid\r\neaout to go into Boston.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose there was more turbulence and what would be called\r\nrowdyism in my day than now.  At any rate I do not hear of\r\nsuch things very often nowadays.  But it was usually of a\r\nharmless character.  There were very few instances indeed\r\nof what would be called dissipation, still fewer of actual\r\nvice.  The only game which was much in vogue was foot-ball.\r\nThere was a little attempt to start the English game of cricket\r\nand occasionally, in the spring, an old-fashioned, simple\r\ngame which we called base was played.  But the chief game\r\nwas foot-ball, which was played from the beginning of the\r\nSeptember term until the cold weather set in, and sometimes,\r\nI believe, in the spring.  It was very unlike the game as at\r\npresent carried on.  After evening prayers, which were over\r\nabout five or ten minutes after six, the boys repaired to\r\nthe foot-ball ground and ranged themselves on sides nearly\r\nequal in number.  If one side thought they were not fairly\r\nmatched they would shout, \"More, more,\" until enough went\r\nover to them from the other side to make it about equal.  Then\r\none of the best kickers gave the ball a kick toward the other\r\nside of the field, and there was a rush and an attempt to\r\nget it past the goal.  Nobody was allowed to pick up the foot-\r\nball, or to run with it in his hand.  A fast runner and good\r\nkicker who could get the ball a little outside of the line\r\nof his antagonists could often make great progress with it\r\nacross the field before he was intercepted.  It was allowable\r\nto trip up one of the other side by thrusting the foot before\r\nhim.  But touching an opponent with the hand would have been\r\nresented as an assault and insult.  The best foot-ball players\r\nwere not the strongest men but the swiftest runners, as a\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThe practice of hazing freshmen during a few weeks after\r\ntheir entering was carried on sometimes under circumstances\r\nof a good deal of cruelty.  One boy in my class was visited\r\nby a party of sophomores, treated with a good deal of indignity,\r\nand his feelings extremely outraged.  He was attacked by a\r\nfever shortly afterward of which he died.  During his last\r\nhours, in his delirium, he was repeating the scenes of this\r\nvisit to his room.  His father thought that the indignity\r\ncaused his death.  Another was taken out from his room in\r\nhis night clothes, tied into a chair and left on the public\r\ncommons in the cold.  It was a long time before he was discovered\r\nand rescued.  A heavy cold and a fit of sickness were the consequence.\r\n\r\nThere was an entertaining custom of giving out what were called\r\nmock parts when the real parts for the exhibitions or Commencement\r\nwere announced.  They were read out from a second-story window\r\nto an assemblage of students in the yard, and after the real\r\nparts had been given some mock parts were read.  Usually some\r\npeculiarity of the person to whom they were assigned was made\r\nthe object of good-natured ridicule in the selection of the\r\nsubject.  For example, one boy, who was rather famous for\r\nsmoking other fellows' cigars and never having any of his\r\nown, had assigned to him as a subject, \"The Friendships of\r\nthis Life all Smoke.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the parts were assigned for the Commencement, which\r\nwere given usually to the first half of the class, there was a\r\nprocession of what was called the Navy Club and an assignment\r\nof honors which were in the reverse order of excellence to\r\nthat observed in the regular parts.  The Lord High Admiral\r\nwas supposed to be the worst scholar in the class,--if possible,\r\none who had been rusticated twice during the college course.\r\nThe laziest man in the class was Rear Admiral.  Then there\r\nwas a Powder Monkey and a Coxswain, and other naval officers,\r\nwho were generally famous for what used to be called demerits.\r\nThe members of the class to whom parts were assigned were\r\ncalled \"digs\" and marched in the procession, each with a spade\r\non his shoulder, the first scholar, who in our class was Child,\r\nas the \"dig of digs,\" having a spade of huge dimensions.\r\nI believe James Russell Lowell was the Lord High Admiral in\r\nhis class.  The Rear Admiral in mine was borne about on a\r\ncouch or litter, supported by four men, having another one\r\nmarching by his side to carry his pipe, which he was supposed\r\nto be too lazy to put into his mouth or take out of his mouth\r\nhimself.  The procession had banners bearing various devices\r\nand went around to take leave of the President and the different\r\nprofessors, giving them cheers at their houses.  President\r\nEverett, who was a serious-minded person, was much offended\r\nby the whole proceeding.  He sent for some members of the\r\nclass and remonstrated; told them he had been obliged to apologize\r\nto his English servant-girl for such an exhibition.  I believe\r\nour class was the last one which performed this harmless and\r\nhighly entertaining ceremony.\r\n\r\nOne of my classmates, afterward a worthy physician, was a\r\ntall man, older considerably than the rest of the class.  He\r\nused to wear an old-fashioned blue, straight-bodied coat\r\nwith brass buttons, a buff vest, and nankeen pantaloons which\r\nwere said to have come down as an heirloom in his family from\r\na remote generation.  He was addicted to rather a pompous\r\nstyle of speech.  He was very fond of playing the bass-viol,\r\nof which he was by no means a very skilful master.  He had,\r\nas a subject for his mock part, \"The Base Violation of all\r\nRules of Harmony.\"  One Sunday evening he had a few friends\r\nwith him who were singing psalm tunes to the accompaniment\r\nof his bass-viol.  They made a prodigious noise, not at all\r\nto the liking of the proctor who had the care of the discipline\r\nof that entry, which was in Holworthy.  He went to the room\r\nfrom which the noise issued.  It was locked and he had some\r\ndifficulty in getting in.  The persons assembled, instead\r\nof maintaining their place, betook themselves to hiding places\r\nin the inner rooms.  My classmate, however, stood his ground\r\nlike a Roman and told the officer that his room was his castle\r\nand that he had no right to come in.  The matter was reported\r\nto the Faculty and the musician sent for.  Instead of submitting\r\nhimself, however, he maintained very sturdily that the visit\r\nof the official to his room was an outrage which he ought\r\nnot be asked to endure.  He made quite an oration to the Faculty.\r\nThereupon he was sentenced, more for his contumacy than for\r\nthe original offence, to suspension from the college for two\r\nor three months.  The class were very indignant and determined\r\nto manifest their indignation in a way that should be understood.\r\nThey got a chariot with six white horses which drove up to\r\nhis door in Holworthy at midday.  Nearly the whole college\r\nassembled to see him off.  He came out and took his seat in\r\nsolitary state in the chariot.  Some eight or ten of the class\r\non horseback accompanied him as outriders.  They drove into\r\nBoston to the front door of the Tremont House in great state.\r\nIt was just at the time the Governor-General of Canada, I\r\nthink Lord Elgin, was expected in Boston on a great occasion\r\nin the history of the city.  The waiters and landlord at the\r\nTremont House thought the English nobleman had arrived and\r\nhurried down the steps to open the door and meet him.  But\r\nhe got out of his carriage with his carpet-bag in his hand\r\nand disappeared in a humble fashion round the corner.  The\r\nFaculty were very indignant and thought of disciplining severely\r\nthe members of the class who had got up the burlesque, especially\r\nthe outriders.  Edward Everett then had under consideration\r\nthe question whether he would accept the Presidency of the\r\nCollege.  It was thought that if a rebellion occurred then\r\nhe would decide against undertaking the responsibility.  So\r\nthey let the whole matter pass.\r\n\r\nThe principal figure in this scene used to be a thorn in\r\nthe flesh of Professor Channing.  He used to insert very\r\npompous and magniloquent sentences in his themes, much to\r\nChanning's disgust.  One day Channing took up a theme and\r\nheld it up and called out, X.  X. came to the chair by the\r\nProfessor's side, and the Professor read, in his shrill voice:\r\n\"'The sable sons of Afric's burning coast.'  You mean negroes,\r\nI suppose.\"  He admitted that he did.  The Professor took\r\nhis pen and drew a line over the sentence he had read and\r\nsubstituted the word \"negroes\" above the line, much to X.'s\r\nmortification.\r\n\r\nI was guilty of one practical joke of which I have repented\r\nall my days, but for which the poetical justice of Providence\r\nadministered to me, many years afterward, a punishment in\r\nkind.  There was a classmate who sat next to me in the recitation\r\nin the sophomore year, whom everybody knew and liked, but\r\nwho was not very much interested in study.  He got along as\r\nhe best could by his native wits and such little application\r\nas he found absolutely necessary.  One day we were reciting\r\nin Lowth's Grammar.  The Bishop says that in English the substantive\r\nsingular is made plural for the most part by adding s.  Professor\r\nChanning called up this classmate of mine, who stated this\r\nas follows:  \"The author says that the distinction between\r\nnouns in the singular and plural is that the latter end in\r\ns.\"  \"Is that a good distinction?\" asked the Professor.  My\r\nneighbor answered with great confidence, \"No, sir,\" as he\r\nwas well warranted in doing from the form of the question.\r\n\"Can't you give us some instance of words in the singular\r\nnumber that end in s?\" said the Professor.  My friend, who\r\nwas considerable embarrassed, stammered, was staggered, and\r\nhesitated a moment.  I whispered in his ear, \"Hoss,\" on which\r\nhe, without any reflection, blurted out, \"Hoss.\"  There was\r\na roar of laughter from the class, and the poor fellow sat\r\ndown, much distressed at his blunder.  Channing dismissed\r\nthe class, and the next day gave us a lecture.  He said our\r\nuproarious laughter had disturbed Dr. Walker's recitation\r\nin the neighboring room, \"especially you, Curtis, with your\r\npit laugh.\"  I ought to have risen up instantly and avowed\r\nmyself the guilty cause of my classmate's innocent blunder.\r\nBut, much to my own shame and disgrace, I did not do it.  But\r\nsome forty years afterward, I was engaged in an earnest discussion\r\nin the Senate Chamber with Butler of South Carolina, at the\r\ntime of the passage of the first Civil Service law.  Butler\r\nfavored the law and his whole bearing in the discussion was\r\nexceedingly proper and creditable.  We were talking of some\r\nprohibition, of some clause forbidding the imposing assessments\r\nupon office-holders for political purposes, and it was proposed\r\nto except from the prohibition voluntary contributions for\r\nproper election purposes.  Butler asked me what I should consider\r\nimproper election purposes.  I hesitated a moment when Miller\r\nof California, who was a man of a good deal of fun, whispered\r\nin my ear, \"Buying shotguns to shoot negroes with,\" which\r\nI, without reflecting and indeed hardly conscious of what\r\nI was saying, repeated aloud.  Butler, who was a man of high\r\nspirit, and quick temper, was furious.  He came down upon\r\nme with a burst of wrath.  I tried to interrupt him.  But\r\nhe was so angry that it was impossible to interrupt him and\r\nsaid something which made it seem to me impossible either\r\nto explain or apologize.  But I regretted the transaction\r\nexceedingly, and have always considered that I was well punished\r\nfor my joke at the expense of my unhappy classmate.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote came down from a class before my time which I\r\nthink ought not to be lost.  One of the boys when the cold\r\nweather came on in the first term of his freshman year took\r\nout from the college library a book which was nearly the largest\r\nand thickest volume it contained.  It was the works of Bishop\r\nWilliams, who I think was one of the seven bishops persecuted\r\nby James II.  The book contained an exceedingly dull treatise\r\non theology.  The youth had no special literary tastes, of\r\nwhich anybody knew, and that was the only book he was ever\r\nknown to take out.  He kept it out the six weeks which were\r\nallowed, and then renewed it, not taking it back to the library\r\nuntil the hot weather of the following summer.  He repeated\r\nthis in his sophomore and junior and senior years.  Dr. Harris,\r\nthe librarian, was very much puzzled and asked some of the\r\nboys if they could tell him why this young man kept Bishop\r\nWilliams's works so constantly.  None of the boys knew.  They\r\nused to see it lying on his table, but never saw any signs\r\nof his reading it.  At last one winter night late in the senior\r\nyear something happened which caused a good deal of excitement.\r\nSeveral of the boys who were down in the yard rushed up in\r\ngreat haste to this classmate's room.  It happened to be unlocked.\r\nThey got in without knocking and found him undressed with\r\nnothing on but his nightgown.  His bed happened to be near\r\nthe fire, and standing up on the edge in front of the fire\r\nwas Bishop Williams's works.  It turned out that he was in\r\nthe habit of thoroughly warming the book and then of putting\r\nit in the bed before he got in himself, so that it would serve\r\nthe function of a warming-pan.  The young gentleman turned\r\nout in after life to be a very distinguished Bishop himself,\r\nan eminent champion of the doctrines of the Episcopal Church,\r\nwhich he had doubtless acquired by absorption.\r\n\r\nThe boys were always ready for mischief and always kind and\r\neasily moved to sympathy.  One day just before prayers there\r\nwas found on the square in front of Willard's Hotel a large\r\nload of straw.  The owner had stopped and unhitched his horses\r\nto feed them at Willard's stable.  Some mischievous boy set\r\nfire to the load and it burned with a blaze which illuminated\r\nthe whole neighborhood.  Pretty soon the owner appeared in\r\na state of great distress; said he was a very poor man; that\r\nhe was moving his household furniture and that his beds, chairs,\r\nand all the goods he had in the world were in the cart covered\r\nup with the straw.  The boys immediately took up a subscription\r\nand sent the fellow off well satisfied with his sale.  It\r\nwas said he got about twice as much as the value he set on\r\nall his goods, and that about a week after he appeared with\r\nanother load of straw which he left exposed in the same place\r\nat the same time in the afternoon.  I believe that was not\r\nmolested.\r\n\r\nThe people of Cambridge in those days were a quiet folk.\r\nThe students did not go much into the society of the town\r\nunless they happened to have some kindred there.  There were\r\na great many old houses, some of which are standing now, built\r\nbefore the Revolutionary War.  Some had been occupied by old\r\nTories.  Among them was the Craigie House still standing,\r\nhaving been Washington's headquarters, and now more famous\r\nstill as the residence of Longfellow.  There were a few old\r\ngentlemen wandering about the streets who were survivors of\r\nthe generation which just followed the Revolutionary War,\r\namong them Dr. Jennison, the old physician, and Dr. Popkin,\r\nthe old Greek professor, of whom a delightful life was written\r\nby President Felton.  Mr. Sales, an old Spaniard, had given\r\nlessons in Spanish from time immemorial.  He was a queer looking\r\nold gentleman, who had his gray hair carefully dressed every\r\nday by a barber, wearing an ancient style of dress, covered\r\nwith snuff, but otherwise scrupulously neat.  He had a curious\r\nbend and walk, which made him seem a little like a dog walking\r\non his hind legs.  He was very fond of the boys and they\r\nof him.  He made full allowance for the exuberance of youth.\r\nTwo careless students who were driving in a sleigh ran against\r\nhim in the street and knocked him over and injured him severely.\r\nBut the old fellow would not betray their names and had nothing\r\nto say when somebody talked severely of their carelessness\r\nbut \"Oh, oh, young blood, young blood.\"  I never saw him in\r\nthe least disturbed or angry with anything the boys said or\r\ndid except on one occasion.  Henry Whitney said, in reciting\r\nin Don Quixote, in the course of some discussion, \"By Jingo,\r\nMr. Sales.\"  Sales was struck with horror.  He said it was\r\nthe most horrible phrase that ever came from the lips of mortal\r\nman, and he should think the walls of the building where they\r\nwere would fall down on Whitney's head and overwhelm him.\r\nWhat awful and mysterious meaning the words \"by Jingo\" had\r\nfor the old Spanish gentleman we never could discover.  He\r\ndeclined to give any explanation and treated the subject\r\nas one to be avoided with horror ever after.  I commend the\r\nquestion to the consideration of philologists.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the students in general by the authorities\r\nand the college was stern, austere and distant.  The students\r\nhad little social intercourse with the families or the professors,\r\nexcept such of them as had relatives in Cambridge, which allowed\r\nintercourse with the families of the professors.  The professors\r\ndid nothing to encourage familiarity, or even to encourage\r\nany request for help in the difficulties of study.  Indeed\r\na boy who did that fell into disfavor with his companions,\r\nand was called a fish.\r\n\r\nPresident Eliot in some speech, I think before the graduates\r\nof the Latin School, speaking of his life as a boy, said\r\nhe had a great respect for his little self.  I cannot say that\r\nof my young self at Harvard.  My time was largely wasted\r\nin novel reading or reading books which had not much to do\r\nwith the college studies, and lounging about in my own room\r\nor that of other students.  I am not sure that the period of\r\ngrowth from sixteen to twenty is one when it is good for a\r\nyouth to study hard.  So far as my observation extends the\r\npoor scholars who have graduated at Harvard become as useful\r\nand eminent men in after life as the good scholars.  I do\r\nnot now think of any person, who has graduated first scholar\r\nsince Edward Everett, who became in after life a very great\r\nman, although some of them have been very respectable.  Judge\r\nThomas Russell, who was first in the class before mine, was\r\na very successful and brilliant man, performing admirably\r\neverything that he undertook.  He was a good judge of the\r\nSuperior Court, a good minister to Venezuela, a good advocate,\r\nand an excellent political speaker.  But he never attained\r\na place in the world equal to that of his classmate Gray,\r\nwho, if I remember right, did not have a part at Commencement.\r\nProfessor Child gained great distinction in his chosen field,\r\nbut, I incline to think, would have gained the same distinction\r\nif he had devoted himself to the same pursuits and had never\r\nentered college at all.  The first scholar in the class of\r\n1843, the first class that graduated after I entered, was\r\nHorace Binney Sargent, a brave soldier, and the author of\r\nsome beautiful and spirited war lyrics.  But there were several\r\nof his classmates, including Thomas Hill, John Lowell and\r\nOctavius B. Frothingham, who attained much greater distinction.\r\nIn the class of 1844 the first scholar was Shattuck Hartwell,\r\na highly respectable and worthy gentleman, many years an officer\r\nin the Boston Custom House, who spent a large part of his\r\nlife fitting pupils for college, while Francis Parkman, the\r\nhistorian, Benjamin Apthorp Gould, the mathematician, and\r\nDr. John Call Dalton, the eminent physician, neither of whom\r\nhad a very high record, became distinguished in after life.\r\nAmong my own classmates, as I have already said, Judge Webb,\r\nFitzedward Hall and Calvin Ellis attained very great distinction,\r\nalthough no one of them stood very high in rank.  In the next\r\nclass John Felton, Judge Endicott, Judge Charles Allen, and\r\nTuckermann, the naturalist, were the persons who have been\r\nmost famous in after life.  I believe no one of them, except\r\nFelton who graduated the second scholar, ranked very high\r\nin college.  I myself graduated with a fairly decent rank.\r\nI believe I was the nineteenth scholar in a class of sixty-\r\nsix.  When I graduated I looked back on my wasted four years\r\nwith a good deal of chagrin and remorse.  I set myself resolutely\r\nto make up for lost time.  I think I can fairly say that I\r\nhave had few idle moments since.  I have probably put as much\r\nhard work into life as most men on this continent.  Certainly\r\nI have put into it all the work that my physical powers, especially\r\nmy eyes, would permit.  I studied law in Concord the first\r\nyear after graduation.  I used to get up at six o'clock in\r\nthe morning, go to the office, make a fire and read law until\r\nbreakfast time, which was at seven in the summer and half-\r\npast in the winter.  Then I went home to breakfast and got\r\nback in about three-quarters of an hour and spent the forenoon\r\nuntil one diligently reading law.  After dinner, at two o'clock,\r\nI read history until four.  I spent the next two hours in\r\nwalking alone in the woods and roads of Concord and the neighboring\r\ntowns, went back to the office at seven, read a little geometry\r\nand algebra, reviewing the slender mathematics which I had\r\nstudied in college, and then spent two hours in reading Greek.\r\nI read through Thucydides, Homer and Xenophon's Hellenica\r\nand some other Greek books in that year.  Sundays I went to\r\nchurch twice, but shut myself up in a room at home the rest\r\nof the day and read a great quantity of English literature,\r\nincluding Milton, Spencer, Chaucer, George Herbert, South's\r\nSermons and other English classics, reading over again Butler's\r\nAnalogy and Jouffroy.  It has been said that if a man wish\r\nto acquire a pure English style he should give his days and\r\nnights to Addison.  I say that if a law student wish to acquire\r\na vigorous and manly English style, the fit vehicle for conveying\r\nweighty thoughts to courts or juries or popular assemblages,\r\nlet him give his days and nights to Robert South.\r\n\r\nI spent two years at the Law School after graduating from\r\nthe College.  I cannot state too strongly my great debt to\r\nit, and to Franklin Dexter, Simon Greenleaf, Joel Parker,\r\nand Theophilus Parsons.  I have no remorse for wasted hours\r\nduring those two years.  The time in a Law School is never\r\nlikely to be wasted if the youth have in him any spark of\r\ngenerous ambition.  He sees the practical relation of what\r\nhe is learning with what he has to do in life.  The Dane Law\r\nSchool was then, and I suppose it is even more true of it\r\nnow, a most admirable place for learning the science of law\r\nand preparing for its practice.  The youth breathed a legal\r\natmosphere from morning till night all the year round.  He\r\nhad the advantage of most admirable instruction, and the resources\r\nof a complete library.  He listened to the lectures, he studied\r\nthe text-books, he was drilled in the recitations, he had\r\npractice in the moot courts and in the law clubs.  He discussed\r\npoints of law in the boarding-house and on his walks with\r\nhis companions.  He came to know thoroughly the great men\r\nwho were his instructors, and to understand their mental processes,\r\nand the methods by which they had gained their success.  The\r\ntitle of old Nathan Dane to a high place on the roll of his\r\ncountry's benefactors, and to the gratitude of the profession of\r\nthe law, and of all lovers of jurisprudence throughout the\r\ncountry cannot be disputed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n1846 TO 1850.  FOUNDATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Republican party, and my personal memories\r\nof Daniel Webster, belong to the same period.  I will not\r\ntry to separate them.\r\n\r\nThe story I am to tell may seem trivial enough to my readers.\r\nBut it is to me a very tender and sacred memory.  The time\r\nwas ripe for the great movement that abolished slavery.  If\r\nno one of the eminent men of that day had ever lived other\r\nmen would have been found in abundance for the work.  If Massachusetts\r\nhad failed in her duty some other State would have taken her\r\nplace.  But in the Providence of God it was given to Massachusetts\r\nto lead in this great battle and it was given to these men\r\nwhom I have to name to be leaders in Massachusetts.  I thank\r\nGod that it was given to my eyes to behold it.  The American\r\npeople have had many great affairs to deal with since that\r\nday.  They have had great trials and great triumphs.  They\r\nhave won renown among the nations.  They have grown in wealth\r\nand in power.  They have subdued a mighty rebellion.  They\r\nhave carried their flag in triumph to the ends of the earth.\r\nThey have wrested the last vestige of power in this hemisphere\r\nfrom an old and proud nation who once occupied the place that\r\nEngland has since occupied and which it seems likely we are\r\nto occupy hereafter.  They have resisted many strong temptations\r\nand acquired much glory.  I am afraid they have of late yielded\r\nfor a time to one strong temptation and missed an opportunity\r\nfor still greater glory, that never will come back.  But there\r\nwas something in that struggle with slavery which exalted\r\nthe hearts of those who had a part in it, however humble,\r\nas no other political battle in history.\r\n\r\n  Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, to be young was far nearer Heaven than Wordsworth\r\nfound France in the opening of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nI became of age at just about the time when the Free Soil\r\nParty, which was the Republican party in another form, was\r\nborn.  In a very humble capacity I stood by its cradle.  It\r\nawakened in my heart in early youth all the enthusiasm of\r\nwhich my nature was capable, an enthusiasm which from that\r\nday to this has never grown cold.  No political party in history\r\nwas ever formed for objects so great and noble.  And no political\r\nparty in history was ever so great in the accomplishment for\r\nliberty, progress and law.\r\n\r\nI breathed a pure and bracing atmosphere in those days.  It\r\nwas a time of plain living and high thinking.  It was a pretty\r\ngood education, better than that of any university, to be\r\na young Free Soiler in Massachusetts.  I had pretty good company,\r\nnot in the least due to any merit or standing of my own, but\r\nonly because the men who were enlisted for the war in the\r\ngreat political battle against slavery were bound to each\r\nother by a tie to which no freemasonry could be compared.\r\nSamuel G. Howe used, when his duties brought him to Worcester\r\non his monthly visit, to spend an hour or two of an afternoon\r\nin my office.  I was always welcome to an hour's converse\r\nwith Charles Allen, the man who gave the signal at Philadelphia\r\nfor breaking away from the Whig Party.  Erastus Hopkins occasionally\r\nspent a Sunday with me at my boarding house.  When I went\r\nto Boston I often spent an hour in Richard Dana's office,\r\nand was sure of a kindly greeting if I chanced to encounter\r\nSumner.  The restless and ubiquitous Henry Wilson, who, as\r\nhe gathered and inspired the sentiment of the people, seemed\r\noften to be in ten places at once, used to think it worth\r\nhis while to visit me to find out what the boys were thinking\r\nof.  In 1851 I was made Chairman of the Free Soil County Committee\r\nof Worcester County.  I do not think there was ever so good\r\na political organization in the country before, or that there\r\never has been a better one since.  The Free Soilers carried\r\nall but six, I think, of the fifty-two towns in that county.\r\nI was in correspondence with the leading men in every one\r\nof them, and could at any time summon them to Worcester, if\r\nthere were need.\r\n\r\nWe acquired by the Mexican War nearly six hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles of territory.  When the treaty was signed, the\r\nstruggle began between freedom and slavery for the control\r\nof this imperial domain.  No reader of the history of Massachusetts\r\nwill doubt her interest in such a struggle.  Three things\r\nstood in the way of lovers of liberty in the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n  First, the old attachment to the Whig party;\r\n  Second, her manufacturing interests; and\r\n  Third, her devotion to Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was a Whig State.  There were many things which\r\ntended to give that great political organization a permanent\r\nhold on her people.  Its standard of personal character was\r\nof the highest.  Its leading men--Saltonstall, Reed, Lawrence,\r\nLincoln, Briggs, Allen, Ashmun, Choate, Winthrop, Davis, Everett,\r\nand their associates--were men whose private and public honor\r\nwas without a stain.  Its political managers were not its\r\nholders of office or its seekers of office.  It contained\r\na large body of able and influential men who wielded the power\r\nof absolute disinterestedness.  They were satisfied if they\r\ncould contribute, by counsel or labor, to the well-being of\r\nthe State by the advancement of their cherished political\r\nprinciples.  They asked no other reward.  The Whigs were in\r\nfavor of using wisely, but courageously, the forces of the\r\nNation and State to accomplish public objects for which private\r\npowers or municipal powers were inadequate.  The Whigs desired\r\nto develop manufacture by national protection; to foster internal\r\nimprovements and commerce by liberal grants for rivers and\r\nharbors; to endow railroads and canals for public ways by\r\ngrants of public lands and from the treasury; to maintain\r\na sound currency; and to establish a uniform system for the\r\ncollection of debts, and for relieving debtors by a National\r\nbankruptcy law.\r\n\r\nThe Whig policy had made Massachusetts known the world over\r\nas the model Commonwealth.  It had lent the State's credit\r\nto railroads.  It had established asylums for the blind and\r\ninsane and deaf and dumb, and had made liberal gifts to schools.\r\nThe Massachusetts courts were unsurpassed in the world.  Her\r\npoor laws were humane.  All her administrative policies were\r\nwise, sound, and economical.\r\n\r\nThey asked from the National Government only a system of protection\r\nthat should foster home manufacture, and that they might pursue\r\ntheir commercial and manufacturing occupation in peace.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster was the idol of the people.  He was at the\r\nfulness of his great intellectual power.  The series of speeches\r\nand professional and political achievements which began with\r\nthe oration at Plymouth in 1820 was still in progress.  The\r\nWhigs of Massachusetts disliked slavery; but they loved the\r\nUnion.  Their political gospel was found in Webster's reply\r\nto Hayne and his great debates with Calhoun.  It was the one\r\nheart's desire of the youth of Massachusetts that their beloved\r\nidol and leader should be crowned with the great office of\r\nthe Presidency.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster tried to avert the conflict by voting against\r\nthe treaty with Mexico, by which we acquired our great territory\r\nin the far West; but in vain.  The Whigs feared the overthrow\r\nof the Whig Party.  The manufacturer and the merchant dreaded\r\nan estrangement that would cause the loss of their southern\r\ntrade, and with it all hope of a law that would protect their\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nIt was in this condition of things that I cast my first vote\r\nin November, 1847, shortly after I became of age.  It was\r\nfor the Whig Governor.  The Whig Party was already divided\r\ninto two sections, one known as \"Cotton Whigs,\" and the other\r\nas \"Conscience Whigs.\"  These names had been suggested in\r\na debate in the State Senate in which Mr. Thomas G. Carey,\r\nan eminent Boston merchant, had deprecated some proposed anti-\r\nslavery resolutions by saying that they were likely to make\r\nan unfavorable impression in the South, and to be an injury\r\nto business interests; to which Mr. E. R. Hoar of Middlesex\r\nanswered, that \"he thought it quite as desirable that the\r\nLegislature should represent the conscience as the cotton\r\nof the Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nBoth parties struggled for the possession of the Whig organization,\r\nand both parties hoped for the powerful support of Mr. Webster.\r\nThe leader of the manufacturing interest was Mr. Abbott Lawrence,\r\na successful, wealthy manufacturer of great business capacity,\r\nlarge generosity, and princely fortune.  He had for some years\r\nchafed under Mr. Webster's imperious and arrogant bearing.\r\nHe was on terms of personal intimacy with Henry Clay, and\r\nwas understood to have inspired the resolutions of the Whig\r\nState Convention, a few years before, which by implication\r\ncondemned Mr. Webster for remaining in President Tyler's\r\nCabinet when his Whig colleagues resigned.  But the people\r\nof Massachusetts stood by Webster.  After the ratification\r\nof the Ashburton Treaty, he came home to reassert his old\r\ntitle to leadership and to receive an ovation in Faneuil Hall.\r\nIn his speech he declared with a significant glance at Mr.\r\nLawrence, then sitting upon the platform:  \"I am a Whig,\r\na Massachusetts Whig, a Boston Whig, a Faneuil Hall Whig.\r\nIf any man wishes to read me out of the pale of that communion,\r\nlet him begin, here, now, on the spot, and we will see who\r\ngoes out first.\"\r\n\r\nThe first time I remember seeing Daniel Webster was June 17,\r\n1843, at Bunker Hill.  The students of Harvard, where I was\r\na freshman, had a place in the procession.  We marched from\r\nCambridge to Boston, three miles and a half, and stood in\r\nour places for hours, and then marched over to Charlestown.\r\nWe were tired out when the oration began.  There was a little\r\nwind which carried the sound of Mr. Webster's voice away\r\nfrom the place where we stood; so it was hard to hear him\r\nduring the first part of his speech.  He spoke slowly and\r\nwith great deliberation.  There was little in the greater\r\npart of that weighty discourse to excite a youthful auditor;\r\nbut the great thing was to look at the great orator.  Waldo\r\nEmerson, who was there, said of him:\r\n\r\n\"His countenance, his figure, and his manners were all in\r\nso grand a style that he was, without effort, as superior to\r\nhis most eminent rivals as they were to the humblest.  He\r\nalone of men did not disappoint the eye and the ear, but\r\nwas a fit figure in the landscape.  There was the Monument,\r\nand there was Webster.  He knew well that a little more or\r\nless of rhetoric signified nothing; he was only to say plain\r\nand equal things--grand things, if he had them; and if he\r\nhad them not, only to abstain from saying unfit things--and\r\nthe whole occasion was answered by his presence.\"\r\n\r\nHe went almost through his weighty discourse without much\r\neffect upon his auditors other than that which Emerson so\r\nwell described.  But the wind changed before he finished,\r\nand blew toward the other quarter where the boys stood; and\r\nhe almost lifted them from their feet as his great organ tones\r\nrolled out his closing sentences:\r\n\r\n\"And when both we and our children shall have been consigned\r\nto the house appointed for all living, may love of country\r\nand pride of country glow with equal fervor among those to\r\nwhom our names and our blood shall have descended! And then,\r\nwhen honored and decrepit age shall lean against the base\r\nof this monument, and troops of ingenuous youth shall be gathered\r\naround it, and when the one shall speak to the other of its\r\nobjects, the purposes of its construction, and the great and\r\nglorious events with which it is connected, there shall rise\r\nfrom every youthful breast the ejaculation, 'Thank God, I\r\nalso--AM AN AMERICAN!'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster came to Concord in the summer of 1843 as counsel\r\nfor William Wyman, President of the Phoenix Bank of Charlestown,\r\nwho was indicted for embezzling the funds of the bank.  This\r\nwas one of the _causes celebres_ of the day.  Wyman had been\r\na business man of high standing.  Such offences were rare\r\nin those days, and the case would have attracted great attention\r\nwhoever had been for the defence.  But the defendant's counsel\r\nwere Daniel Webster, Rufus Choate, Franklin Dexter, and my\r\nbrother, E. R. Hoar, a young man lately admitted to the bar.\r\nMr. Webster, notwithstanding his great fame as a statesman,\r\nis said never to have lost his eager interest in causes in\r\nwhich he was retained.  When he found himself hard pressed,\r\nhe put forth all his strength.  He was extremely impatient\r\nof contradiction.  The adulation to which he had been so long\r\naccustomed tended to increase a natural, and perhaps not\r\nwholly unjustifiable, haughtiness of manner.\r\n\r\nThe Government was represented by Asahel R. Huntington, of\r\nSalem, District Attorney for the district which included Essex\r\nand Middlesex.  He was a man of great intellectual vigor,\r\nunquestioned honesty and courage, possessed of a high sense\r\nof the dignity and importance of his office, very plain spoken,\r\nand not at all likely to be overawed by any opposing counsel,\r\nwhatever his fame or dignity.  Yet he had a huge reverence\r\nfor Daniel Webster, whom, like the other Massachusetts Whigs\r\nof that day, he probably thought as another described him--\r\n\r\n  The foremost living man of all the world!\r\n\r\nThe case was tried three times:  The first time at Concord,\r\nthe second time at Lowell, and the third time at Concord.\r\nMr. Webster had several quite angry encounters with the court\r\nand with the prosecuting attorney.  He was once extremely\r\ndisrespectful to Judge Washburn, who replied with great mildness\r\nthat he was sure the eminent counsel's respect for his own\r\ncharacter would be enough to prevent him from any disrespect\r\nto the court.  Mr. Webster was disarmed by the quiet courtesy\r\nof the judge, and gave him no further cause for complaint.\r\nAt Lowell, where Wyman was convicted, Webster saw the case\r\ngoing against him, and interrupted the charge of the judge\r\nseveral times.  At last Judge Allen, who was presiding, said:\r\n\"Mr. Webster, I cannot suffer myself to be interrupted.\" Mr.\r\nWebster replied: \"I cannot suffer my client to be misrepresented,\"\r\nTo which the judge answered:  \"Sit down, sir.\"  Mr. Webster\r\nresumed his seat.  When the jury went out, Judge Allen turned\r\nto the Bar where Mr. Webster was sitting and said: \"Mr. Webster.\"\r\nMr. Webster rose with the unsurpassed courtesy and grace of\r\nmanner of which he was master, and said: \"Will the court pardon\r\nme a moment?\"  He then proceeded to express his regret for\r\nthe zeal which had impelled him to a seeming disrespect to\r\nHis Honor, and expressed his sorrow for what had occurred;\r\nand the incident was at an end.\r\n\r\nAt the first trial at Concord, Mr. Webster had frequent altercations\r\nwith District Attorney Huntington.  In his closing argument,\r\nwhich is said to have been one of great power, and which he\r\nbegan by an eloquent reference to the battle of Concord Bridge,\r\nwhich, he said, was fought by Concord farmers that their children\r\nmight enjoy the blessings of an impartial administration of\r\njustice under the law, he said that it was unlikely that Wyman\r\ncould have abstracted large sums from the bank and no trace\r\nof the money be found in his possession.  He was a man of\r\nsmall property, living simply and plainly, without extravagant\r\nhabits or anything which would have been likely to tempt him\r\nto such crime.  When Huntington came to reply he said, very\r\nroughly:  \"They want to know what's become of the money.\r\nI can tell you what's become of the money.  Five thousand\r\ndollars to one counsel, three thousand dollars to another,\r\ntwo thousand to another,\" waving his hand in succession toward\r\nWebster and Choate and Dexter.  Such fees, though common enough\r\nnow, seemed enormous in those days.  Choate smiled in his\r\npeculiar fashion, and said nothing; Franklin Dexter looked\r\nup from a newspaper he was reading, and exclaimed: \"This is\r\nbeneath our notice\"; but Mr. Webster rose to his feet and\r\nsaid with great indignation: \"Am I to sit here to hear myself\r\ncharged with sharing the spoils with a thief?\" The presiding\r\njudge said:  \"The counsel for the Government will confine\r\nhimself to the evidence.\" That was all.  But Mr. Webster\r\nwas deeply incensed.  The jury disagreed.  Mr. Webster came\r\nto the next trial prepared with an attack on Huntington, in\r\nwriting, covering many pages, denouncing his method and conduct.\r\nThis he read to my brother.  But Huntington who, as I have\r\nsaid, adored Webster, was unwilling to have another encounter--\r\nnot in the least from any dread of his antagonist, but solely\r\nfrom his dislike to have a quarrel with the man on earth he\r\nmost reverenced.  Accordingly, Mr. Wells, the District Attorney\r\nof Greenfield, was called in, who conducted the trial at Lowell\r\nand succeeded in getting a conviction.  My brother, who was\r\nvery fond of Huntington, took an occasion some time afterward\r\nto tell Mr. Webster how much Huntington regretted the transaction,\r\nand how great was his feeling of reverence and attachment\r\nfor him.  Mr. Webster was placated, and afterward, when an\r\nedition of his speeches was published, sent a copy to Huntington\r\nwith an inscription testifying to his respect.\r\n\r\nThe general reader may not care for the legal history of\r\nthe trial, but it may have a certain interest for lawyers.  Mr.\r\nWyman was indicted for embezzlement of the funds of the bank\r\nunder the Revised Statutes of Massachusetts, which provided\r\nthat \"if any cashier or other officer, agent or servant of\r\nany incorporated bank shall embezzle or fraudulently convert\r\nto his own use the property of the bank, he shall be punished,\"\r\netc.  It was earnestly contended that a president of a bank\r\nwas not an officer within the meaning of the statute; but\r\nthis contention was overruled by the presiding judge, who\r\nwas sustained in that view by the Supreme Court on exception.\r\nThere was, however, no such offence as embezzlement known\r\nto the common law.  So a person who fraudulently converted\r\nto his own use the property of another could only be convicted\r\nof larceny; and the offence of larceny could not be committed\r\nwhere the offender had been entrusted with the possession\r\nof the property converted, the essence of larceny being the\r\nfelonious taking of the property from the possession of the\r\nowner.  Further, nobody could be convicted of larceny except\r\non an indictment or complaint which set forth the time and\r\nplace of each single conversion.  So, if a servant or agent\r\nappropriated the fund of his principal, the embezzlement extending\r\nover a long period of time, and it was not possible to set\r\nforth or to prove the time, place, and circumstances of any\r\nparticular taking, the offender could not be convicted.  The\r\nstatute to which I have just referred was intended to cure\r\nboth these difficulties; first, by making persons liable to\r\npunishment who fraudulently appropriated the property of others,\r\nnotwithstanding they had come rightfully into possession; and\r\nnext, the necessity of setting forth the particular transaction\r\nwas obviated by an enactment that it should be enough to\r\nprove the embezzlement of any sum of money within six months\r\nof the time specified in the indictment.\r\n\r\nAfter the conviction of Wyman, the case was carried to the\r\nSupreme Court, which held that the statute making bank officers\r\nliable included bank presidents.  But the court held that\r\nthe other part of the statute, providing for the mode of\r\nsetting forth the offence in the indictment, did not apply to\r\nbank officers; and that they could only be held on an indictment\r\nwhich described the particular transaction, with time and\r\nplace.  So the verdict of guilty against Wyman was set aside,\r\nand a new trial ordered.\r\n\r\nBefore the new trial came on at Concord, a statute was passed\r\nby the Legislature for the purpose of meeting this very case,\r\nextending the provisions of the Revised Statutes as to the\r\nmode of pleading in such cases to officers of banks.  It was\r\nclaimed and argued by Mr. Choate, with great zeal, eloquence,\r\nand learning, that this was an _ex post facto_ law, which\r\ncould not, under the Constitution, be made applicable to transactions\r\nwhich happened before its passage.  Mr. Choate argued this\r\nquestion for several hours.  The court took time for consideration,\r\nand overruled his contention.  There seemed nothing for it\r\nbut to go to trial again on the facts, upon which one verdict\r\nof guilty had already been had.  As they were going into the\r\ncourt-house in the morning, Mr. Choate said to Mr. Hoar,\r\nwhose chief part in the trial, so far, had been finding law\r\nbooks, hunting up authorities, and taking notes of the evidence:\r\n\"You made a suggestion to me at the last trial which I did\r\nnot attend to much at the time; but I remember thinking afterward\r\nthere was something in it.\" Mr. Hoar replied: \"It seems to\r\nme that Wyman cannot be convicted of embezzlement unless the\r\nfunds of the bank were entrusted to him.  They must either\r\nhave been in his actual possession or under his control.\r\nThere is nothing in the office of president which involves\r\nsuch an authority.  It cannot exist unless by the express\r\naction of the directors, or as the result of a course of\r\nbusiness of the bank.\"  The facts alleged against Wyman were\r\nthat he had authorized the discount of the notes of some\r\nfriends of his who were irresponsible, and that he had, in\r\nsome way, shared the proceeds.  Mr. Choate seized upon the\r\nsuggestion.  The Government witnesses, who were chiefly the\r\ndirectors of the bank, were asked in cross-examination whether\r\nthey had not consented that Mr. Wyman should have the right\r\nto dispose of the funds of the bank, or to give him power\r\nor authority to dispose of them.  They supposed the question\r\nwas put with the intent of making them morally, if not legally,\r\naccomplices in his guilt, or of charging them with want of\r\nfidelity or gross carelessness in their office.  Accordingly,\r\neach of them indignantly denied the imputation, and testified\r\nthat Wyman had no power or authority to authorize the discount\r\nor to meddle with the funds.  When the Government case closed,\r\nthe counsel asked the court to rule that as the funds were\r\nnever entrusted to the possession of Wyman he could not be\r\nconvicted of embezzlement.  The court so held and directed an\r\nacquittal.  This is another instance, not unusual in trials\r\nin court, of the truth of the old rhyme, with which the readers\r\nof \"Quentin Durward\" are familiar;\r\n\r\n  The page slew the boar,\r\n  The peer had the gloire.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster always had a strong and kindly regard for my brother.\r\nWhen Mr. Hoar visited Washington in 1836, Webster received\r\nhim with great kindness, showed him about the Capitol, and\r\ntook him to the Supreme Court, where he argued a case.  Mr.\r\nWebster began by alluding very impressively to the great changes\r\nwhich had taken place in that Tribunal since he first appeared\r\nas counsel before them.  He said: \"No one of the judges who\r\nwere here then, remains.  It has been my duty to pass upon\r\nthe question of the confirmation of every member of the Bench;\r\nand I may say that I treated your honors with entire impartiality,\r\nfor I voted against every one of you.\" After the argument\r\nwas over Mr. Webster gave Mr. Hoar a very interesting sketch\r\nof the character of each of the judges, and told him the reasons\r\nwhich caused him to vote against confirmation in each case.\r\n\r\nThe next time I saw Daniel Webster was on July 4, 1844.  He\r\nmade a call at my father's house in Concord.  I was near one\r\nof the front windows, and heard a shout from a little crowd\r\nthat had gathered in the street, and looked out just as Mr.\r\nWebster was coming up the front steps.  He turned, put his\r\nhand into his bosom under his waistcoat and made a stately\r\nsalutation, and then turned and knocked on the door and was\r\nadmitted.  He was physically the most splendid specimen of\r\nnoble manhood my eyes ever beheld.  It is said, I suppose\r\ntruly, that he was but a trifle over five feet nine inches\r\nhigh, and weighed one hundred and fifty-four pounds.  But\r\nthen, as on all other occasions that I saw him, I should have\r\nbeen prepared to affirm that he was over six feet high and\r\nweighed, at least, two hundred.  The same glamour is said\r\nto have attended Louis XIV., whose majesty of bearing was\r\nsuch that it never was discovered that he was a man of short\r\nstature until he was measured for his coffin.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was then in the very vigor of his magnificent\r\nmanhood.  He stood perfectly erect.  His head was finely\r\npoised upon his shoulders.  His beautiful black eyes shone\r\nout through the caverns of his deep brows like lustrous jewels.\r\nHis teeth were white and regular, and his smile when he was\r\nin gracious mood, especially when talking to women, had an\r\nirresistible charm.  I remember very little that he said.\r\nOne thing was, when the backwardness or forwardness of the\r\nseason was spoken of, that there was a day--I think it was\r\nJune 15--when, in every year vegetation was at about the same\r\ncondition of forwardness, whether the spring were early or\r\nlate.  A gentleman who was in the room said: \"You have the\r\ncool breezes of the sea at Marshfield?\" \"There, as at other\r\nsea places,\" replied Mr. Webster.  When he rose to go, he\r\nsaid:  \"I have the honor to be a member of the Young Men's\r\nWhig Club of Boston.  I must be in my place in the ranks.\"\r\n\r\nI heard him also in Faneuil Hall, in the autumn of 1844,\r\nafter the elections in Maine and Pennsylvania and in the\r\nSouth had made certain the defeat of Mr. Clay.  I remember\r\nlittle that he said, except from reading the speech since.\r\nWhat chiefly impressed the audience was the quotation from\r\nMilton, so well known now:\r\n\r\n  What though the field be lost?\r\n  All is not lost; the unconquerable will,\r\n  And study of revenge, immortal hate,\r\n  And courage never to submit or yield,\r\n  And what is else not be overcome.\r\n\r\nI also saw Mr. Webster at the inauguration of Edward Everett\r\nas President of Harvard, April 30, 1846.  It was perhaps the\r\nproudest period of Webster's life.  It was also, perhaps,\r\nthe greatest day of the life of Edward Everett.  Webster had\r\nbeen Everett's great over-shadower.  Gov. Everett would have\r\nbeen, but for him, the chief public man and the orator of\r\nMassachusetts at that time.  He had returned from the Court\r\nof St. James crowned with new laurels, and had been called\r\nto succeed Josiah Quincy as the head of the University.  By\r\na simple but impressive inaugural ceremony the Governor had\r\njust invested Mr. Everett with his office, and delivered to\r\nhim the keys and the charter.  Everett was stepping forward\r\nto deliver his inaugural address when Webster, who had come\r\nout from Boston a little late, came in upon the stage by a\r\nside door.  President and orator and occasion were all forgotten.\r\nThe whole assembly rose to greet him.  It seemed as if the\r\ncheering and the clapping of hands and the waving of handkerchiefs\r\nwould never leave off.  The tears gushed down the cheeks of\r\nwomen and young men and old.  Everything was forgotten but\r\nthe one magnificent personality.  When the din had subsided\r\nsomewhat, Mr. Everett, with his never-failing readiness and\r\ngrace, said:  \"I would I might anticipate a little the function\r\nof my office, and saying--_Expectatur oratio in vernacula_--\r\ncall upon my illustrious friend who has just entered upon\r\nthe stage to speak for me.  But I suppose that the proprieties\r\nof the occasion require that I speak for myself.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to the credit of Mr. Everett and of that other Massachusetts\r\norator, Rufus Choate, that no tinge of jealousy or of envy\r\never embittered in the smallest degree their hearty love and\r\nsupport of their friend.  They were his pupils, his companions,\r\nhis supporters, his lovers, while he lived, and were his best\r\neulogists when he died.\r\n\r\nI heard another speech of his, which I think was never reported.\r\nHe appeared before a Committee of the Legislature as counsel\r\nfor the remonstrants against the scheme to fill up the Back\r\nBay lands.\r\n\r\nI do not think the employment of a Senator of the United\r\nStates as counsel before the Legislature would be approved\r\nby public opinion now.\r\n\r\nI do not know what year it was, but probably 1849 or 1850.\r\nHe had grown old.  But I learned more of the fashion of his\r\nmental operations than could be learned from his speeches\r\non great occasions, especially after they had been revised\r\nfor publication.  He spoke with much contempt of a petition\r\nsigned by many of the foremost merchants and business men\r\nof Boston.  He described with great sarcasm the process of\r\ncarrying about such petitions, and the relief of the person\r\nto whom they were presented on finding he was not asked to\r\ngive any money.  \"Oh, yes, I'll sign--I'll sign.\"  He then\r\nread out one after another the names of men well known and\r\nhonored in the city.  He threw down the petition with contempt,\r\nand the long sheet fell and unrolled upon the floor.\r\n\r\nHe had a singular habit, which made it wearisome to listen\r\nto his ordinary speech, of groping after the most suitable\r\nword, and trying one synonym after another till he got that\r\nwhich suited him best.  \"Why is it, Mr. Chairman, that there\r\nhas gathered, congregated, this great number of inhabitants,\r\ndwellers, here; that these roads, avenues, routes of travel,\r\nhighways, converge, meet, come together, here?  Is it not\r\nbecause we have here a sufficient, ample, safe, secure, convenient,\r\ncommodious, port, harbor, haven?\"  Of course when the speech\r\ncame to be printed all the synonyms but the best one would\r\nbe left out.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster seemed rather feeble at that time, and called\r\nupon his friend Mr. William Dehon to read for him the evidence\r\nand extracts from reports with which he had to deal.  His\r\ntome was the tone of ordinary conversation, and his speech,\r\nwhile it would not be called hesitating, was exceedingly\r\nslow and deliberate.  I have been told by persons who heard\r\nhim in the Supreme Court in his later years that the same\r\ncharacteristic marked his arguments there, and that some of\r\nhis passages made very little impression upon the auditors,\r\nalthough they seemed eloquent and powerful when they came\r\nto be read afterward.\r\n\r\nHis is frequently spoken of as a nervous Saxon style.  That\r\nis a great mistake, except as to a few passages where he rose\r\nto a white heat.  If any person will open a volume of his\r\nspeeches at random, it will be found that the characteristic\r\nof his sentences is a somewhat ponderous Latinity.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of Democrats joined the Free Soil movement\r\nin 1848.  Conspicuous among them was Marcus Morton, who had\r\nbeen Governor and one of our ablest Supreme Court judges,\r\nand his son, afterward Chief Justice, then just rising into\r\ndistinction as a lawyer.  The members of the Liberty Party\r\nalso, who had cast votes for Birney in 1844, were ready for\r\nthe new movement.  But the Free Soil Party derived its chief\r\nstrength, both of numbers and influence, from the Whigs.  The\r\nAnti-Slavery Whigs clung to Webster almost to the last.  He\r\nhad disappointed them by opposing the resolution they offered\r\nat the Whig State Convention, pledging the party to support\r\nno candidate not known by his acts or declared opinions to\r\nbe opposed to the extension of slavery.  But he had coupled\r\nhis opposition with a declaration of his own unalterable opposition\r\nto that extension, and had said, speaking of those who were\r\nin favor of the declaration:  \"It is not their thunder.\"\r\n\r\nHe declared in the Senate, as late as 1848:  \"My opposition\r\nto the increase of slavery in the country, or to the increase\r\nof slave representation in Congress, is general and universal.\r\nIt has no reference to lines of latitude or points of the\r\ncompass.  I shall oppose all such extension, and all such\r\nincrease, at all times, under all circumstances, even against\r\nall inducements, against all combinations, against all compromises.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Anti-Slavery Whigs eagerly supported him as their\r\ncandidate for the Whig nomination in 1848.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Webster had been nominated for the Presidency in 1848,\r\nthe Free Soil Party would not have come into existence that\r\nyear.  There would have been probably some increase in the\r\nnumbers of the Liberty Party; yet the Anti-Slavery Whigs of\r\nMassachusetts would have trusted him.  But the nomination\r\nof General Taylor, a Southerner, one of the largest slaveholders\r\nin the country, whose laurels had been gained in the odious\r\nMexican War, upon a platform silent upon the engrossing subject\r\nof the extension of slavery, could not be borne.  The temper\r\nof the Whig National Convention was exhibited in a way to\r\nirritate the lovers of freedom in Massachusetts.  When some\r\nallusion was made to her expressed opinions, it was received\r\nwith groans and cries of \"Curse Massachusetts.\" But, on the\r\nwhole, the Massachusetts Whigs shared the exultant anticipation\r\nof triumph, and of regaining the power from which they had\r\nbeen excluded since the time of John Quincy Adams, except\r\nfor the month of Harrison's short official life.  But as the\r\nconvention was about to adjourn, intoxicated with hope and\r\ntriumph, Charles Allen, a delegate from Massachusetts, a man\r\nof slender figure, rose, and with a quiet voice declared the\r\nWhig Party dissolved.  Never was a prediction received with\r\nmore derision; never was prediction more surely fulfilled.\r\nHe was reinforced by Henry Wilson, afterward Vice-President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nImmediately on their return from Philadelphia, a call was\r\ncirculated for a convention to be held at Worcester of all\r\npersons opposed to the nomination of Cass and Taylor.  The\r\ncall was written by E. R. Hoar.  My father, Samuel Hoar, was\r\nits first signer.\r\n\r\nThis is the call.  It should be preserved in a form more\r\nenduring than the leaflet, of which I possess, perhaps, the\r\nonly copy in existence.\r\n\r\n\"TO THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\"The Whig National Convention have nominated General Taylor\r\nfor President of the United States.  In so doing they have\r\nexceeded their just authority, and have proposed a candidate\r\nwhom no Northern Whig is bound to support.\r\n\r\n\"HE IS NOT A WHIG, when tried by the standard of our party\r\norganization.  He has never voted for a Whig candidate, has\r\ndeclared that the party must not look to him as an exponent\r\nof its principles, that he would accept the nomination of\r\nthe Democratic Party, and that he would not submit his claims\r\nto the decision of the Whigs, acting through their regularly\r\nconstituted Convention.\r\n\r\n\"HE IS NOT A WHIG, if judged by the opinions he entertains\r\nupon questions of public policy. Upon the great questions\r\nof currency and Finance, of Internal Improvements, of Protection\r\nto American Industry, so far from agreeing with the Whigs,\r\nhe has distinctly avowed that he has formed no opinion at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"HE IS NOT A WHIG, if measured by the higher standard of principle,\r\nto which the Whigs of Massachusetts and of the North have\r\npledged themselves solemnly, deliberately, and often.  He\r\nis not opposed to the extension of Slavery over new territories,\r\nacquired, and to be acquired, by the United States.  He is\r\na Slave-holder, and has been selected because he could command\r\nvotes which no Whig from the free States could receive.\r\n\r\n\"To make room for him, the trusted and faithful Champions\r\nof our cause have all been set aside.\r\n\r\n\"The Whigs of Massachusetts, by their Legislature, and in\r\ntheir popular assemblies, have resolved, that opposition\r\nto the extension of Slavery is a fundamental article in their\r\npolitical faith.  They have spoken with scorn and upbraiding\r\nof those Northern Democrats who would sacrifice the rights\r\nand interests of the Free States upon the altar of party subserviency.\r\n\r\n\"The Whigs of the Legislature have recently declared to the\r\ncountry, 'that if success can attend the party, only by the\r\nsacrifice of Whig principles, or some of them,' they did\r\nnot mean to be thus successful; that they are determined\r\n'to support a candidate who will not suffer us to be over-\r\nbalanced by annexations of foreign territory, nor by the\r\nfurther extension of the institution of Slavery, which is\r\nequally repugnant to the feelings, and incompatible with the\r\npolitical rights of the Free States'; and that they 'believe\r\nit to be the resolute purpose of the Whig people of Massachusetts,\r\nto support these sentiments, and carry into effect the design\r\nwhich they manifest.'\r\n\r\n\"Believing that the support of General Taylor's nomination\r\nis required by no obligations of party fidelity, and that\r\nto acquiesce in it would be the abandonment of principles\r\nwhich we hold most dear, treachery to the cause of Freedom,\r\nand the utter prostration of the interests of Free Labor and\r\nthe Rights of Freemen:\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, Whigs of Massachusetts, call upon their\r\nfellow-citizens throughout the Commonwealth, who are opposed\r\nto the nomination of CASS and TAYLOR, to meet in Convention\r\nat Worcester, on _Wednesday,_ the 28th day of June current,\r\nto take such steps as the occasion shall demand, in support\r\nof the PRINCIPLES to which they are pledged, and to co-operate\r\nwith the other Free States in a Convention for this purpose.\"\r\n\r\nMy first political service was folding and directing these\r\ncirculars.  The Convention was held, and Samuel Hoar presided.\r\nIt was addressed by men most of whom afterward became eminent\r\nin the public service.  Among them were Charles Sumner, Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, Henry Wilson, E. R. Hoar, Edward L. Keyes,\r\nCharles Allen, Lewis D. Campbell, of Ohio, and Abraham Payne,\r\nof Rhode Island.  Richard H. Dana was present, but I think\r\nhe did not speak.  William Lloyd Garrison and Francis Jackson\r\nwere present, but took no part whatever.  I rode to Boston\r\nin a freight car after the convention was over, late at night.\r\nGarrison and Jackson were sitting together and talking to\r\na group of friends.  Garrison seemed much delighted with the\r\nday's work, but said he heard too much talk about the likelihood\r\nthat some of the resolutions would be popular and bring large\r\nnumbers of votes to the party.  He said:  \"All you should\r\nask is, what is the rightful position? and then take it.\"\r\nAmong the resolutions was this:\r\n\r\n\"That Massachusetts looks to Daniel Webster to declare to\r\nthe Senate and to uphold before the country the policy of\r\nthe Free States; that she is relieved to know that he has not\r\nendorsed the nomination of General Taylor; and that she invokes\r\nhim at this crisis to turn a deaf ear to 'optimists' and 'quietists',\r\nand to speak and act as his heart and his great mind shall\r\nlead him.\"\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster's son Fletcher was present, and heartily in\r\naccord with the meeting; and this resolution was passed with\r\nhis full approval.  It met great opposition from the men who\r\nhad come into the movement from the Liberty Party and from\r\nthe Democratic Party.  The shouts of \"No, no; too late\" were\r\nnearly, if not quite, equal to the expressions of approval.\r\nBut the president declared that it was passed.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster sulked in his tent during the summer, and at last,\r\nSeptember 1, 1848, made a speech at Marshfield, in which he\r\ndeclared the nomination of Taylor not fit to be made, but\r\ngave it a half-hearted support.  My brother, Judge E. R.\r\nHoar, had been an enthusiastic admirer of Webster, who had\r\ntreated him with great personal kindness; and, as I have said,\r\nhe had been associated with Mr. Webster in the famous Wyman\r\ntrial.  Mr. Webster made a speech in the Senate in August,\r\ndeclaring his renewed opposition to the extension of slavery.\r\nMr. Hoar wrote a letter expressing his satisfaction with that\r\nspeech, and urging him to take his proper place at the head\r\nof the Northern Free Soil movement.  This is Mr. Webster's\r\nreply.  It is interesting as the last anti-slavery utterance\r\nof Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nMARSHFIELD, August 23, 1848.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\nI am greatly obliged to you, for your kind and friendly letter.\r\nYou overrate, I am sure, the value of my speech, it was quite\r\nunpremeditated and its merit, if any, consists I presume in\r\nits directness and brevity.  It mortified me to see that some\r\nof the newspaper writers speak of it as the \"taking of a position\";\r\nas if it contained something new for me to say.  You are not\r\none of them, my dear sir, but there are those who will not\r\nbelieve that I am an anti-slavery man unless I repeat the\r\ndeclaration once a week.  I expect they will soon require\r\na periodical affidavit.  You know, that as early as 1830 in\r\nmy speech on Foote's resolution, I drew upon me the anger\r\nof enemies, and a regret of friends by what I said against\r\nslavery, and I hope that from that day to this my conduct\r\nhas been consistent.  But nobody seems to be esteemed to be\r\nworthy of confidence who is not a new convert.  And if the\r\nnew convert be as yet but half converted, so much the better.\r\nThis I confess a little tries one's patience.  But I can assure\r\nyou in my own case, it will not either change my principles\r\nor my conduct.\r\n\r\nIt is utterly impossible for me to support the Buffalo nomination.\r\nI have no confidence in Mr. Van Buren, not the slightest.\r\nI would much rather trust General Taylor than Mr. Van Buren\r\neven on this very question of slavery, for I believe that\r\nGeneral Taylor is an honest man and I am sure he is not so\r\nmuch committed on the wrong side, as I know Mr. Van Buren\r\nto have been for fifteen years.  I cannot concur even with\r\nmy best friends in giving the lead in a great question to\r\na notorious opponent to the cause.  Besides; there are other\r\ngreat interests of the country in which you and I hold Mr.\r\nVan Buren to be essentially wrong, and it seems to me that\r\nin consenting to form a party under him Whigs must consent\r\nto bottom their party on one idea only, and also to adopt\r\nas the representative of that idea a head chosen on a strange\r\nemergency from among its steadiest opposers.  It gives me\r\npain to differ from Whig friends whom I know to be as much\r\nattached to universal liberty as I am, and they cannot be\r\nmore so.  I am grieved particularly to be obliged to differ\r\nin anything from yourself and your excellent father, for both\r\nof whom I have cherished such long and affectionate regards.\r\nBut I cannot see it to be my duty to join in a secession from\r\nthe Whig Party for the purpose of putting Mr. Van Buren at\r\nthe head of the Government.  I pray you to assure yourself,\r\nmy dear Sir, of my continued esteem and attachment, and remember\r\nme kindly and cordially to your father.\r\n\r\n  Yours, etc.,\r\n  DANIEL WEBSTER\r\n\r\n  Honorable E. Rockwood Hoar.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoar had before had a somewhat interesting interview\r\nwith Mr. Webster to the same effect.  Late in the winter,\r\nbefore the convention at Philadelphia, some young Whigs had\r\na dinner at the Tremont House, to concert measures to support\r\nhis candidacy.  There were forty or fifty present.  Mr. Webster\r\nwas expected to speak to them, but his daughter Julia was\r\nvery ill.  He sent them a message that he would see them at\r\nthe house in Summer Street where he was staying.  So when\r\nthe dinner was half over, the party walked in procession to\r\nMr. Paige's house.  As Judge Hoar described the interview,\r\nhe seemed very glum.  He shook hands with the young men as\r\nthey passed by him, but said very little.  There was an awkward\r\nsilence, and they were about to take leave, when the absurdity\r\nof the position struck Mr. Hoar, who was the youngest of\r\nthe party, rather forcibly.  Just then he heard Mr. Webster\r\nsay to somebody near him: \"The day for eminent public men\r\nseems to have gone by.\"  Whereupon Hoar stepped forward and\r\nmade him a brief speech, which he began by saying that the\r\nobject of their coming together was to show that, in their\r\nopinion, the day for eminent public men had not gone by, and\r\nsome more to the same effect.  Webster waked up and his eyes\r\nflashed and sparkled.  He made a speech full of vigor and\r\nfire.  He spoke of his name being brought before the Whig\r\nconvention at Philadelphia, and of his fidelity to the party.\r\nHe said that whether his own name should be in the judgment\r\nof the convention suitable or the best to present to the country\r\nthe convention would determine, and added: \"If the convention\r\nshall select anyone of our conspicuous leaders, trained and\r\nexperienced in civil affairs, of national reputation as a\r\nstatesman, he will receive my hearty support.  But if I am\r\nasked whether I will advise the convention at Philadelphia\r\nto nominate, or if nominated I will recommend the people to\r\nsupport for the office of President of the United States,\r\na swearing, fighting, frontier colonel, I only say that I\r\nshall not do it.\"\r\n\r\nMany people think that if Mr. Webster would have supported\r\nGeneral Taylor's policy of dealing with the questions relating\r\nto slavery it would have prevailed, and that the country would\r\nhave been pacified and the Civil War avoided.  I do not think\r\nso.  The forces on both sides who were bringing on that conflict\r\nwere too powerful to be subdued by the influence of any individual\r\nstatesman.  The irrepressible conflict had to be fought out.\r\nBut Mr. Webster's attitude not only estranged him from the\r\nsupporters of General Taylor in his own party, but, of course,\r\nmade an irreparable breach between him and the anti-slavery\r\nmen who had founded the Free Soil Party.  He was the chief\r\ntarget for all anti-slavery arrows from March 7, 1850, to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the Harvard Law School, Mr. Webster was counsel\r\nin a very interesting divorce case where Choate was upon the\r\nother side.  The parties were in high social position and\r\nvery well known.  Mr. Choate's client, who was the wife, was\r\ncharged with adultery.  I did not hear the closing argument,\r\nbut my classmates who did reported that Mr. Webster spoke\r\nof the woman with great severity and argued the case with\r\na scriptural plainness of speech.  He likened the case of\r\nthe husband bound to an adulterous wife to the old Hebrew\r\npunishment of fastening a living man to a corpse.  \"Who shall\r\ndeliver me from the body of this death?\" But Judge Fletcher,\r\nwho held the court, decided in favor of the wife.\r\n\r\nThe meeting which gathered at Worcester in pursuance of the\r\nabove call, inaugurated for the first time a party for the\r\nsole object of resisting the extension of slavery.  The Liberty\r\nParty, which had cast a few votes in the presidential election\r\nof 1840, and which, in 1844, had turned the scale in New York\r\nand so in the nation against Mr. Clay, was willing to support\r\nthe candidates of other parties who were personally unobjectionable\r\nto them in this respect.  But the Free Soil Party, of which\r\nthe present Republican party is but the continuation under\r\na change of name, determined that no person should receive\r\nits support for any national office, who himself continued\r\nhis association with either of the old political organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Free Soil Party of Massachusetts cast in the presidential\r\nelection of 1848 only about 37,000 votes, but it included\r\namong its supporters almost every man in the Commonwealth\r\nold enough to take part in politics who has since acquired\r\nany considerable national reputation.  Charles Sumner who\r\nhad become known to the public as an orator and scholar by\r\nthree or four great orations, was just at the threshold of\r\nhis brilliant career.  Charles Francis Adams, who had served\r\nrespectably but without great distinction, in each branch\r\nof the Legislature, brought to the cause his inflexible courage,\r\nhis calm judgment, and the inspiration of his historic name.\r\nJohn A. Andrew, then a young lawyer in Boston, afterward to\r\nbecome illustrious as the greatest war Governor in the Union,\r\ndevoted to the cause an eloquence stimulant and inspiring\r\nas a sermon of Paul.  John G. Palfrey, then a Whig member\r\nof Congress from the Middlesex District, discussed the great\r\nissue in speeches singularly adapted to reach the understanding\r\nand gratify the taste of the people of Massachusetts, and\r\nin a series of essays whose vigor and compactness Junius might\r\nhave envied, and with a moral power which Junius could never\r\nhave reached.  Anson Burlingame, afterward Minister to China,\r\ncaptivated large crowds with his inspiring eloquence.*  Samuel\r\nG. Howe, famous in both hemispheres by his knightly service\r\nin the cause of Greek independence, famous also by his philanthropic\r\nwork in behalf of the insane and blind, brought his great\r\ninfluence to the party.  Henry Wilson, a mechanic, whose early\r\ntraining had been that of the shoemaker's shop, but who understood\r\nthe path by which to reach the conscience and understanding\r\nof the workingmen of Massachusetts better than any other man,\r\nhad been also a delegate to the Convention at Philadelphia,\r\nand had united with Judge Allen in denunciation of its surrender\r\nof liberty.  Stephen C. Phillips, a highly respected merchant\r\nof Salem, and formerly Whig Representative from the Essex\r\nDistrict, gave the weight of his influence in the same direction.\r\nSamuel Hoar, who had been driven from South Carolina when\r\nhe attempted to argue the case for the imprisoned colored\r\nseamen of Massachusetts before the courts of the United States,\r\none of the most distinguished lawyers of the Massachusetts\r\nbar, came from this retirement in his old age to give his\r\nservice in the same cause; of which his son, E. R. Hoar,\r\nwas also a constant, untiring, and enthusiastic champion.\r\nRichard H. Dana, master of an exquisite English style, the\r\nonly Massachusetts advocate who ever encountered Rufus Choate\r\non equal terms, threw himself into the cause with all the\r\nardor of his soul.  On the Connecticut River, George Ashmun,\r\nthe most powerful of the Whig champions in western Massachusetts,\r\nfound more than his match in Erastus Hopkins.  William Claflin,\r\nafterward Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, and Governor of Massachusetts,\r\nmember of the National House of Representatives, and Chairman\r\nof the Republican National Committee, was then in his early\r\nyouth.  But he had already gained a competent fortune by his\r\nbusiness sagacity.  He brought to the cause his sound judgment,\r\nhis warm and affectionate heart, and his liberal hand.  He\r\nwas then, as he has ever since been, identified with every\r\ngood and generous cause.  His stanch friendship was then,\r\nas it has been ever since, the delight and comfort of the\r\nchampions of freedom in strife and obloquy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Shortly after Burlingame came into active life, he made a journey\r\nto Europe.  The American Minister obtained for him a ticket of\r\nadmission to the House of Commons.  He was shown into a very\r\ncomfortable seat in the gallery.  In a few minutes an official\r\ncame and told him he must leave that seat; that the gallery\r\nwhere he was was reserved for Peers.  They are very particular\r\nabout such things there.  Burlingame got up to go out when an\r\nold Peer who happened to be sitting by and had heard what was\r\nsaid, interposed.  \"Let him stay, let him stay.  He is a Peer\r\nin his own country.\"  \"I am a Sovereign in my own country, Sir,\"\r\nreplied Burlingame, \"and shall lose caste if I associate\r\nwith Peers.\"  And he went out.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nEach of these men would have been amply fitted in all respects\r\nfor the leader of a great party in State or Nation.  Each\r\nof them could have defended any cause in which he was a believer,\r\nby whatever champion assailed.  They had also their allies\r\nand associates among the representatives of the press.  Among\r\nthese were Joseph T. Buckingham, of the Boston _Courier,_\r\nthen the head of the editorial fraternity in Massachusetts;\r\nJohn Milton Earle, the veteran editor of the Worcester _Spy;_\r\nWilliam S. Robinson, afterward so widely known as Warrington,\r\nwhose wit and keen logic will cause his name to be long preserved\r\namong the classics of American literature.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of some of these men more at length elsewhere.\r\nI knew them, all but two, very intimately.  I only knew Joseph\r\nT. Buckingham by sight.  He edited the Boston _Courier_ with\r\ngreat ability.  He was a member of both Houses of the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature.  He was a member of the State Senate in 1850\r\nand 1851.  He left the _Courier_ in June, 1848, about the\r\ntime the Free Soil movement begun, and was not active in politics\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nI had no personal acquaintance with Charles Francis Adams.\r\nI have known his son, Charles Francis Adams, President of\r\nthe Massachusetts Historical Society, pretty well.  He inherits\r\na great deal of the ability and independence which belongs\r\nto his race.  He would undoubtedly have taken a very high\r\nplace in the public and official life of his generation if\r\nhe had found himself in accord with either of the great political\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nI do not think anybody, except the very intimate friends\r\nof Charles Francis Adams, was aware of his great abilities\r\nuntil he manifested them amid the difficulties of the English\r\nMission.  They were known, however, to a few men who were\r\nintimate with him.  I was quite astonished one day when I\r\ncalled on Dr. Palfrey, at his house in Cambridge in 1852,\r\nand he told me Mr. Adams was entirely competent for the office\r\nof President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was rather dull as a public speaker.  He was apt\r\nto announce commonplaces slowly and deliberately, as if they\r\nwere something he thought his audience was listening to for\r\nthe first time.  But the influence of his historic name was\r\nvery great.  His marvellous resemblance to his father and\r\ngrandfather made a great impression.  When he said at Worcester\r\non the 28th of June, 1848:  \"I say, in words to which I have\r\na hereditary right, 'Sink or Swim, Live or Die, Survive or\r\nPerish, I give my hand and my heart to this movement,'\" it\r\nseemed to the audience as if old John Adams had stepped down\r\nfrom Trumbull's picture of the Signing of the Declaration\r\nof Independence to give his benediction.*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* I like very much the epitaph which his sons placed over him in\r\nthe burial place at Quincy.  Every word of it is true.\r\n\r\nTHIS STONE\r\nMARKS THE GRAVE OF\r\nCHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS\r\nSON OF JOHN QUINCY\r\nAND LOUISA CATHERINE (JOHNSON)\r\nADAMS\r\nBORN 18 AUGUST 1807\r\n  Trained from his youth in politics and letters\r\n  His manhood strengthened by the convictions\r\n  Which had inspired his fathers\r\n  He was among the first to serve\r\n  And among the most steadfast to support\r\n  That new revolution\r\n  Which restored the principles of liberty\r\n  To public law\r\n  And secured to his country\r\n  The freedom of its soil\r\n  During seven troubled and anxious years\r\n  Minister of the United States in England\r\n  afterward arbitrator at the tribunal of Geneva\r\n  He failed in no task which his Government imposed\r\n  Yet won the respect and confidence\r\n  of two great nations\r\n  Dying 21 November 1886\r\n  He left the example\r\n  of high powers nobly used\r\n  and the remembrance\r\n  of a spotless name.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nBesides these more conspicuous leaders, there was to be found,\r\nin almost every town and village in Massachusetts, some man\r\neminent among his neighbors for purity of life, for philanthropy,\r\nand for large intelligence who was ready to join the new party.\r\nThe glowing hopes and dreams and aspirations of youth were\r\ninspirited by the muse of Whittier and Longfellow and Lowell\r\nand Bryant.  The cause of free labor appealed to the strongest\r\nsympathies of the mechanics of Essex and the skilled laborers\r\nof Worcester.\r\n\r\nFour years afterward Daniel Webster, as he lay dying at Marshfield,\r\nsaid to the friend who was by his side:  \"The Whig candidate\r\nwill obtain but one or two States, and it is well; as a national\r\nparty, the Whigs are ended.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whig Party retained its organization in Massachusetts\r\nuntil 1856; but its intellect and its moral power were gone.\r\nMr. Winthrop, as appears from the excellent \"Life\" published\r\nby his son, had no sympathy with Mr. Webster's position.  Mr.\r\nWebster died, a disappointed man, in the autumn of 1852.  He\r\ntook no part in political affairs in Massachusetts after 1850.\r\nMr. Choate, who was to follow his great leader to the grave\r\nwithin a few years, transferred his allegiance to the Democrats.\r\nMr. Everett, after a brief service in the Senate, a service\r\nmost uncongenial to his own taste, resigned his seat in the\r\nmidst of the angry conflict on the Nebraska bill, and devoted\r\nhimself to literary pursuits until, when the war broke out,\r\nhe threw himself with all his zeal, power, and eloquence into\r\nthe cause of his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nLIFE IN WORCESTER\r\n\r\nAfter leaving college I studied for a year in my brother's\r\noffice in Concord, then for two years at the Harvard Law\r\nSchool, and afterward for four months in the office of Judge\r\nBenjamin F. Thomas in Worcester.  I was led to choose Worcester\r\nas a place to live in chiefly for the reason that that city\r\nand county were the stronghold of the new Anti-Slavery Party,\r\nto which cause I was devoted with all my heart and soul.  I\r\nhave never regretted the choice, and have spent my life there,\r\nexcept when in Washington, for considerably more than half\r\na century.  In that time Worcester has grown from a city of\r\nfifteen thousand to a city of one hundred and thirty thousand\r\npeople.  I can conceive of no life more delightful for a man\r\nof public spirit than to belong to a community like that which\r\ncombines the youth and vigor and ambition of a western city\r\nwith the refinement and conveniences, and the pride in a noble\r\nhistory, of an old American community.  It is a delight to\r\nsee it grow and a greater delight to help it grow,--to help\r\nimprove its schools, and found its Public Library, and help\r\nlay the foundations of great institutions of learning.  Worcester\r\nhad an admirable Bar, admirable clergymen, and physicians\r\nof great skill and eminence.  Among her clergymen was Edward\r\nEverett Hale, then in early youth, but already famous as a\r\npreacher throughout the country.  There was no Unitarian pulpit\r\nwhere he was not gladly welcomed.  So his congregation here,\r\nby way of exchange, heard the most famous pulpit orators of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAmong the physicians was Dr. Joseph Sargent, a man then without\r\na superior in his profession in Massachusetts.  The friendship\r\nI formed with him in 1849 lasted till his death, more than\r\nforty years afterward.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics of Worcester were unsurpassed for their ingenuity\r\nanywhere on the face of the earth.  Worcester was the centre\r\nand home of invention.  Within a circle of twelve miles radius\r\nwas the home of Blanchard, the inventor of the machine for\r\nturning irregular forms; of Elias Howe, the inventor of the\r\nsewing machine; of Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton\r\ngin, which doubled the value of every acre of cotton-producing\r\nland in the country; of Erastus B. Bigelow, the inventor\r\nof the carpet machine; of Hawes, the inventor of the envelope\r\nmachine; of Crompton and Knowles, the creators and perfectors\r\nof the modern loom; of Ruggles, Nourse and Mason, in whose\r\nestablishment the modern plow was brought to perfection, and\r\na great variety of other agricultural implements invented\r\nand improved.  There were many other men whose inventive genius\r\nand public usefulness were entitled to rank with these.  The\r\nfirst house-warming furnace was introduced here, and the second\r\ncupola furnace was set up near by.\r\n\r\nThese inventors and mechanics were all men of great public\r\nspirit, proud of Worcester, of its great achievements, and\r\nits great hope.  They got rich rapidly.  They and their households\r\nmade social life most delightful.  There was little pride\r\nof family or wealth.  Men and women were welcomed everywhere\r\non their merits.\r\n\r\nThe City of Worcester was the heart of one of the foremost\r\nagricultural counties in the country.  The county stood fourth\r\namong American counties in the value of its agricultural products,\r\nand the proportion of the value of the product to the value\r\nof the lands.  It was the spot on the face of the earth where\r\nlabor got the largest proportion of the joint product of labor\r\nand capital.  The farmers made an excellent living.  They\r\nmade excellent legislators, excellent town officers, excellent\r\njurors, and excellent clients.  I have been at some time or\r\nother in my life counsel for every one of the fifty-two towns\r\nin Worcester County.  I had a large clientage among the farmers.\r\nIn the intimacy of that relation I got a knowledge of the\r\ninmost soul and heart of a class of men who I think constituted\r\nwhat was best in American citizenship, a knowledge which has\r\nbeen a great educational advantage to me and valuable in a\r\nthousand ways in my public and professional life.\r\n\r\nFrom the first of December, 1849, until the fourth of March,\r\n1869, I was diligently employed in my profession, save for\r\na single year's service in each house of the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature.  But during all that time I kept a very zealous\r\ninterest in political affairs.  I was Chairman of the County\r\nCommittee for several years, made political speeches occasionally,\r\npresided at political meetings, always attended the caucus\r\nand was in full sympathy and constant communication with the\r\nFree Soil and Republican leaders.\r\n\r\nThe Worcester Bar in my time afforded a delightful companionship.\r\nIt was like a college class in the old days.  My best and\r\nmost cordial friends were the men whom I was constantly encountering\r\nin the courts.  The leaders of the Bar when I was admitted\r\nto it,--Charles Allen, Emory Washburn, Pliny Merrick, Benjamin\r\nF. Thomas, Peter C. Bacon,--would have been great leaders\r\nat any Bar in the United States, or on any circuit in England.\r\nStudy at a law school is invaluable to the youth if he is\r\nto rise in his profession; but there is no law school like\r\na court-house when such men are conducting trials.  The difficult\r\nart of cross-examination, the more difficult art of refraining\r\nfrom cross-examination, can only be learned by watching men\r\nwho are skilled in the active conduct of trials.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Massachusetts at that day with Chief\r\nJustice Shaw at its head was without an equal in the country\r\nand not surpassed by the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nitself.  I can conceive of no life more delightful than that\r\nof a lawyer in good health, and with good capacity, and with\r\na sufficient clientage, spent in that manly emulation and\r\nhonorable companionship.\r\n\r\nThe habit of giving dissenting opinions which has become\r\nso common both in the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nand of late in the Massachusetts Supreme Court did not then\r\nexist.  If there were a division on an important question\r\nof law the statement of the result was usually \"a majority\r\nof the Court is of opinion.\"  That was all.  I do not believe\r\nany court can long retain public confidence and respect when\r\nnearly all its opinions in important matters are accompanied\r\nby a powerful attack on the soundness of the opinion and the\r\ncorrectness of the judgment from the Bench itself.  The Reporter\r\nof the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is, I believe, authorized\r\nto report the decisions of the court more or less at length\r\nat his discretion.  If he would exercise that discretion by\r\nan absolute refusal to print dissenting opinions, except in\r\na few very great and exceptional cases, he would have the\r\nthanks of the profession.  It may be harder to put a stop\r\nto the practice in the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nThat will have to be done, if at all, by the good sense of\r\nthe Judges.  The recent opinions of the Court in what are\r\nknown as the Insular Cases have shocked the country and greatly\r\ndiminished the weight and authority of the tribunal.  This\r\nwas not because of public disapproval of the opinion of the\r\nCourt.  It was because upon one of the greatest questions\r\nof Constitutional law and Constitutional liberty that ever\r\nwent to judgment, there could be found no single reason for\r\nthe decision of the Court strong enough to convince any two\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I have been for nearly thirty-five years in\r\npublic life, and likely to be, if I live, in public life a few\r\nyears longer, is an instance of how--\r\n\r\n  The best laid schemes o' mice and men\r\n  Gang aft a-gley.\r\n\r\nDown to the time I was admitted to the Bar, and indeed for\r\na year later, my dream and highest ambition were to spend\r\nmy life as what is called an office lawyer, making deeds and\r\ngiving advice in small transactions.  I supposed I was absolutely\r\nwithout capacity for public speaking.  I expected never to\r\nbe married; perhaps to earn twelve or fifteen hundred dollars\r\na year, which would enable me to have a room of my own in\r\nsome quiet house, and to earn enough to collect rare books\r\nthat could be had without much cost.  I can honestly say with\r\nGeorge Herbert:  \"I protest and I vow I even study thrift,\r\nand yet I am scarce able, with much ado, to make one half\r\nyear's allowance shake hands with the other.  And yet if a\r\nbook of four or five shillings come in my way, I buy it, though\r\nI fast for it; yea, sometimes of ten shillings.\"\r\n\r\nBut I happened one night in the autumn of 1850 to be at a\r\ngreat mass meeting in the City Hall, at Worcester, which\r\nCharles Allen was expected to address.  It was the year of\r\nthe Compromise Measures, including the Fugitive Slave Law,\r\nand of Daniel Webster's 7th of March speech.  Judge Allen,\r\nas he was somewhat apt to do, came in late.  A vast audience\r\nhad gathered and were waiting.  Nobody seemed ready to speak.\r\nSomebody started the cry, \"Hoar!  Hoar!\"  My father and brother\r\nwere known as leaders in the Free Soil Party, and that I suppose\r\nmade somebody call on me.  I got up in my place in the middle\r\nof the hall in great confusion.  There were shouts of \"platform,\"\r\n\"platform.\" I made my way to the platform, hoping only to\r\nmake my excuses and get off without being detected.  But the\r\npeople were disposed to be good-natured, and liked what I\r\nsaid.  Dr. Stone, the famous stenographic reporter, was present\r\nand took it down.  It was printed in the Free Soil papers,\r\nand from that time I was in considerable demand as a public\r\nspeaker.  The coalition between the Free Soilers and Democrats\r\ncarried the State of Massachusetts that year and elected Sumner\r\nSenator and Boutwell Governor.  The next year Worcester failed\r\nto elect her representatives to the Legislature, which were\r\nvoted for all on one ticket and required a majority, and there\r\nwas to be a second election on the fourth Monday of November.\r\nThere was a delegate convention to nominate representatives,\r\nof which I was a member.  When the vote was announced, to\r\nmy surprise and consternation, I was one of the persons nominated.\r\nNobody had said a word to me about it beforehand.  That was\r\nFriday night.  I told the Convention I could not accept such\r\na nomination without my father's approval.  I was then twenty-\r\nfive years old.  It was proposed that the Convention adjourn\r\nuntil the next evening, and that meantime I should go down\r\nto Concord and see if I could get my father's leave.  Accordingly\r\nthe Convention adjourned to see if the infant candidate could\r\nget permission to accept.  My father told me he thought that\r\nto go to the Legislature once would be useful to me in my\r\nprofession; I should learn how laws were made, and get acquainted\r\nwith prominent men from different parts of the State.  So\r\nhe advised me to accept, if I would make up my mind that I\r\nwould go only for one year, and would after that stick to\r\nthe law, and would never look to politics as a profession\r\nor vocation.  I accepted the nomination, was elected, and\r\nwas made Chairman of one of the Law Committees in the House.\r\n\r\nI declined a reelection and devoted myself to my profession,\r\nexcept that I served in the Massachusetts Senate one year,\r\n1857, being nominated unexpectedly and under circumstances\r\nsomewhat like those which attended my former nomination.  I\r\nwas Chairman of the Judiciary Committee that year.  I devoted\r\nall my time, day and even far into the night, to my legislative\r\nduties.  I was never absent a single day from my seat in the\r\nHouse in 1852, and was absent only one day from my seat in\r\nthe Senate, in 1857, when I had to attend to an important\r\nlaw suit.  It so happened that there was a severe snow storm\r\nthat day, which blocked up the railroads, so that there was\r\nno quorum in the Senate.  I could not myself have got to the\r\nState House, if I had tried.  I suppose I may say without\r\narrogance that I was the leader of the Free Soil Party in\r\neach House when I was a member of it.  In 1852 I prepared,\r\nwith the help of Horace Gray, afterward Judge, who was not\r\na member of the Legislature, the Practice Act of 1852, which\r\nabolished the common law system of pleading, and has been\r\nin principle that on which the Massachusetts courts have acted\r\nin civil cases ever since.  I studied the English Factory\r\nlegislation, and read Macaulay's speeches on the subject.\r\nI became an earnest advocate for shortening the hours of labor\r\nby legislation.  That was then called the ten-hour system.\r\nLater it has been called the eight-hour system.  I made, in\r\n1852, a speech in favor of reducing the time of labor in factories\r\nto ten hours a day which, so far as I know, was the first\r\nspeech in any legislative body in this country on that subject.\r\nMy speech was received with great derision.  The House, usually\r\nvery courteous and orderly, seemed unwilling to hear me through.\r\nOne worthy old farmer got up in his seat and said: \"Isn't\r\nthe young man for Worcester going to let me get up in the\r\nmorning and milk my caouws.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a member of the Senate in 1857, I was Chairman of the\r\nJudiciary Committee.  I made a very earnest and carefully\r\nprepared speech against the asserted right of the jury to\r\njudge of the law in criminal cases.  It is a popular and specious\r\ndoctrine.  But it never seemed to me to be sound.  Among others,\r\nthere are two reasons against it, which seem to me conclusive,\r\nand to which I have never seen a plausible answer.  One is\r\nthat if the jury is to judge of the law, you will have as\r\nmany different laws as you have juries.  There is no revision\r\nof their conclusion.  They are not obliged to tell, and there\r\nis no way in which the court can know, what their opinion\r\nwas.  So a man tried on one side of the court-house may be\r\nheld guilty, and another man tried on the other side of the\r\ncourt-house may be held innocent for precisely the same act.\r\n\r\nThe other reason is that the court must always decide what\r\nevidence shall be admitted.  So if the jury are to be the\r\njudges of the law, one authority must determine what evidence\r\nthey shall consider, and another determine what law shall\r\nbe applied to it.  For instance, suppose a defendant charged\r\nwith homicide offers to prove certain facts which as he claims\r\njustify the killing.  The Judge says these facts do not, under\r\nthe law, justify the killing and excludes the evidence.  That\r\nmay be the real point in the case, and the jury may believe\r\nthat those facts fully justify the homicide; still they cannot\r\nbe permitted to hear them.  It is preposterous to suppose\r\nthat so logical and reasonable a system as the Common Law\r\ncould ever have tolerated such an absurdity.  My friend, Mr.\r\nJustice Gray of the United States Supreme Court, an admirable\r\njudge and one of the great judges of the world, in his dissenting\r\nopinion in _Sparf et al. v. U. S., 156, U. S. Reports,\r\npage 51, etc.,_ has little to say on this point, except that\r\nof course there must be some authority to regulate the conduct\r\nof trials.\r\n\r\nI declined a reelection to the Senate.  I was twice nominated\r\nfor Mayor by the Republicans of Worcester, when the election\r\nof their candidate was sure; once by a Citizens' Convention,\r\nand once by a Committee authorized to nominate a candidate,\r\nand another year urged by prominent and influential citizens\r\nto accept such a nomination.  But I preferred my profession.\r\nI never had any desire or taste for executive office, and\r\nI doubt if I had much capacity for it.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Allen declined reelection to Congress, in 1852,\r\nI have no doubt I could have succeeded him if I had been willing,\r\nalthough I was but twenty-six years old, only a year past\r\nthe Constitutional age.\r\n\r\nAs I found myself getting a respectable place in the profession\r\nmy early ambitions were so far changed and expanded that I\r\nhoped I might some day be appointed to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  It seemed to me then,\r\nas it seems to me now, that there could be no more delightful\r\nlife for a man competent to the service than one spent in\r\ndiscussing with the admirable lawyers, who have always adorned\r\nthat Bench, the great questions of jurisprudence, involving\r\nthe rights of citizens, and the welfare of the Commonwealth,\r\nand helping to settle them by authority.  This ambition was\r\nalso disappointed.  I have twice received the offer of a seat\r\non that Bench, under circumstances which rendered it out of\r\nthe question that I should accept it, although on both occasions\r\nI longed exceedingly to do so.\r\n\r\nShortly after I was admitted to the Bar, good fortune brought\r\nme at once into the largest practice in the great County of\r\nWorcester, although that Bar had always been, before and since,\r\none of the ablest in the country.  Judge Emory Washburn, afterward\r\nGovernor and Professor of Law at Harvard, and writer on jurisprudence,\r\nhad the largest practice in the Commonwealth, west of Boston,\r\nand I suppose with one exception, the largest in the Commonwealth\r\noutside of Boston.  He asked me to become his partner in June,\r\n1852.  I had then got a considerable clientage of my own.\r\nEarly in 1853 he sailed for Europe, intending to return in\r\nthe fall.  I was left in charge of his business during his\r\nsix months' absence, talking with the clients about cases\r\nin which he was already retained, and receiving their statements\r\nas to cases in which they desired to retain him on his return.\r\nBefore he reached home he was nominated for Governor by the\r\nWhig Convention, to which office he was elected by the Legislature\r\nin the following January.  So he had but a few weeks to attend\r\nto his law business before entering upon the office of Governor.\r\nI kept on with it, I believe without losing a single client.\r\nThat winter I had extraordinarily good fortune, due I think\r\nvery largely to the kindly feeling of the juries toward so\r\nyoung a man attempting to undertake such great responsibilities.\r\n\r\nMy professional life from January 1, 1850, until the 4th\r\nof March, 1869, was a life of great and incessant labor.\r\nWhen the court was in session I was constantly engaged in\r\njury trials.  Day after day, and week after week, I had to\r\npass from one side of the court-house to the other, being\r\nengaged in a very large part of the important actions that\r\nwere tried in those days.  The Court had long sessions.  The\r\njudges who came from abroad were anxious to get their work\r\ndone and go back to their homes.  So the Courts sat from half\r\npast eight or nine o'clock in the morning until six in the\r\nafternoon with an intermission of an hour, or an hour and\r\na quarter, for dinner.  The parties to the suits came from\r\nall over Worcester County.  Frequently it was impossible to\r\nsee the witnesses until the trial came on, or just before.\r\nSo the lawyer had to spend his evenings and often far into\r\nthe night in seeing witnesses and making other preparations\r\nfor the next day.  General Devens and I had at one term of\r\nthe Supreme Court held by Chief Justice Bigelow twenty trial\r\nactions.  The term resulted in a serious injury to my eyes\r\nand in my being broken down with overwork.  So I was compelled\r\nto go to Europe the following year for a vacation.\r\n\r\nBut I found time somehow, as I have said, to keep up a constant\r\nand active interest in politics.  I was also able to contribute\r\nsomething to other things which were going on for the benefit\r\nof our growing city.  I got up the first contribution for\r\nthe Free Public Library, of which I was made President.  I\r\ntook a great interest in the founding of the famous Worcester\r\nPolytechnic Institute, and I was the first person named in\r\nits Act of Incorporation.  The first meeting of its Trustees\r\nwas held in my office, and I am now the only surviving member\r\nof that Board, in which I have retained a warm interest ever\r\nsince.  In 1869 I made before the Massachusetts Legislature,\r\non a petition which was successful for a legislative grant\r\nto that school, what I believe is the first public address\r\never made in behalf of Technical Education in this country.\r\nI was for some time President of the Board of Trustees of\r\nthe City Library and while President planned the excellent\r\nreading room connected with the Library, for which I obtained\r\na handsome endowment by personal solicitation.\r\n\r\nI was also Trustee of Leicester Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Worcester Lyceum, which furnished the principal course\r\nof lectures in the city in those days, was in the hands of\r\nsome very worthy and conservative old Whigs.  They would not\r\npermit any politics or religion, or what was called Radicalism,\r\neither in religious or social matters, to be discussed on\r\ntheir platform.  So we had to listen to very respectable and\r\nworthy, but rather dull and tame conservative gentlemen, or\r\nstay away, as we preferred.  A few of the young men, of whom\r\nI was one, conspired to get possession of the Lyceum.  They\r\nturned out in force for the election of officers, chose me\r\nPresident, and we got Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker\r\nand Ralph Waldo Emerson and other shining lights of a newer\r\nphilosophy, much to the indignation of the old Whig magnates.\r\nBut the lectures were very successful, and at the end of my\r\nPresidency, which lasted two or three years, we had an ample\r\nbalance in our treasury.\r\n\r\nIf I were to give an account of my professional life for\r\ntwenty years, I must make another book.  It was full of interest\r\nand romance.  The client in those days used to lay bare his\r\nsoul to his lawyer.  Many of the cases were full of romantic\r\ninterest.  The lawyer followed them as he followed the plot\r\nof an exciting novel, from the time the plaintiff first opened\r\nhis door and told his story till the time when he heard the\r\nsweetest of all sounds to a lawyer, the voice of the foreman\r\nsaying:  \"The jury find for the plaintiff.\" Next to the \"yes,\"\r\nof a woman, that is the sweetest sound, I think, that can\r\nfall on human ears.\r\n\r\nI used to have eighteen or twenty law cases at the fall term\r\neach year.  The judges gave their opinions orally in open\r\nCourt, and the old judges like Shaw and Metcalf, used to enliven\r\nan opinion with anecdotes or quaint phrases, which lent great\r\ninterest to the scene.  If Walter Scott could have known and\r\ntold the story of the life of an old Massachusetts lawyer\r\nfrom the close of the Revolution down to the beginning of\r\nthe Rebellion, there is nothing in the great Scotch novels\r\nwhich would have surpassed it for romance and for humor.\r\n\r\nI think I may fairly claim that I had a good deal to do with\r\ndeveloping the equity system in the courts of Massachusetts,\r\nand with developing the admirable Insolvency system of Massachusetts,\r\nwhich is substantially an equity system, from which the United\r\nStates Bankruptcy statutes have been so largely copied.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the people of Massachusetts, Whigs and Democrats\r\nas well as Republicans, were loyal and patriotic and full\r\nof zeal when the war broke out.  A very few of the old Whigs\r\nand Democrats, who were called \"Hunkers\" or \"Copperheads,\"\r\nsympathized with the Rebellion, or if they did not, were so\r\npossessed with hatred for the men who were putting it down\r\nthat they could find nothing to approve, but only cause for\r\ncomplaint and faultfinding.  Andrew, the Governor, Sumner\r\nand Wilson, the Senators, most of the members of Congress,\r\nmost of the leaders in the Legislature and in the military\r\nand political activities, were of the old Free Soil Party.\r\nThere was a feeling, not wholly unreasonable, that the old\r\nWhigs had been somewhat neglected, and that their cooperation\r\nand help were received rather coldly.  This feeling led to\r\nthe movement, called the People's Party, which begun at a\r\nlarge public meeting in Cambridge, where my dear old friend\r\nand partner, ex-Governor Washburn, was one of the speakers.\r\nThat party called a State Convention and nominated Charles\r\nDevens for Governor.  Devens had been an old Whig.  He had\r\nbecome a Republican in 1856, and had been one of the earliest\r\nto enlist in the War, in which he became afterward the most\r\nfamous Massachusetts soldier.  He was a man of spirit, very\r\naffectionate and generous, always ready to stand by his friends,\r\nespecially if he suspected that anybody had treated them unjustly.\r\nThe People's Party sent a Committee to the seat of war in\r\nSeptember, 1862.  The Committee found Devens in his tent,\r\nrepeated to him the plans of his old Whig friends, and induced\r\nhim to accept the nomination of the People's Party for Governor.\r\n\r\nI was called to the battlefield of Antietam, where a near\r\nkinsman of mine had been mortally wounded, just about the\r\nsame time.  I entered Devens's tent just as this Committee\r\nwas leaving it with his written acceptance in their hands.\r\nI told him the other side of the story, told him how the\r\nwhole people were alive with enthusiasm, and that Governor\r\nAndrew was doing the very best possible, and that these petty\r\njealousies, while there was some little reason for them,\r\nought not to affect the public action of the people.  Devens\r\nregretted very much what he had done.  He told me that if\r\nhe could recall the letter, he would do it.  But it was too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nGovernor Andrew was triumphantly reelected, and Devens was\r\never after an earnest and loyal Republican.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nPOLITICAL HISTORY OF MASSACHUSETTS FROM\r\n1848 TO 1869\r\n\r\nIn 1848, the Free Soil Party in Massachusetts nominated candidates\r\nfor State officers.  It was made up of Whigs, Democrats and\r\nmembers of the Liberty Party.  It had made no distinct issue\r\nwith the Whig Party upon matters of State administration.\r\nGovernor Briggs, the Whig Governor, was a wise and honest\r\nChief Magistrate, highly respected by all the people.  But\r\nthe Free Soil leaders wisely determined that if they were\r\nto have a political party, they must have candidates for State\r\nofficers as well as National.  It is impossible to organize\r\na political party with success whose members are acting together\r\nin their support of one candidate and striving with all their\r\nmight against each other when another is concerned.  My father\r\nwas urged to be the Free Soil candidate for Governor.  Charles\r\nFrancis Adams and Edmund Jackson visited him at Concord to\r\npress it upon him as a duty.  Charles Allen wrote him an earnest\r\nletter to the same effect.  But he was an old friend of Governor\r\nBriggs and disliked very much to become his antagonist.  He\r\nlooked to the Whig Party for large accessions to the Free\r\nSoil ranks.  A large plurality of the people of the community\r\nwere still devoted to that party.  He doubted very much the\r\nwisdom of widening the breach between them by a conflict on\r\nother questions than that of slavery.  So he refused his consent.\r\nStephen C. Phillips, an eminent Salem merchant, and a former\r\nMember of Congress, was nominated.  The result was there was\r\nno choice of State officers by the people, and the election\r\nof the Whig candidates was made by the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe next year it occurred to the leaders of the Free Soil\r\nand Democratic Parties that they had only to unite their\r\nforces to overthrow the Whigs.  The Free Soil leaders thought\r\nthe effect of this would be the eventual destruction of the\r\nWhig Party at the North,--as afterward proved to be the case,--\r\nand the building up in its place of a party founded on the\r\nprinciple of opposition to the extension of slavery.  So in\r\n1849 there was a coalition between the Free Soil and the Democratic\r\nParties in some counties and towns, each supporting the candidates\r\nof the other not specially obnoxious to them, neither party\r\ncommitting itself to the principles of the other party or\r\nwaiving its own.  In the fall of the next year, 1850, this\r\npolicy was pursued throughout the State and resulted in the\r\nelection by the Legislature of a Democratic Governor, Mr.\r\nBoutwell, and of Charles Sumner as the successor of Daniel\r\nWebster in the Senate.  The experiment was repeated with like\r\nsuccess in the fall of 1851.\r\n\r\nThese two parties had little in common.  They could not well\r\nact together in State matters without some principle or purpose\r\non which they were agreed other than mere desire for office\r\nand opposition to the Whig Party.  They found a common ground\r\nin the support of a law providing for secrecy in the ballot.\r\nThere had been great complaint that the manufacturers, especially\r\nin Lowell, who were in general zealous Whig partisans, used\r\nan undue influence over their workmen.  It was said that a\r\nman known to be a Democrat, or a Free Soiler, was pretty likely\r\nto get his discharge from the employ of any great manufacturing\r\ncorporation that had occasion to reduce its force, and that\r\nhe would have no chance to get an increase of wages.  I do\r\nnot now believe there was much foundation for this accusation.\r\nBut it was believed by many people at the time.  So a law\r\nrequiring secrecy in the ballot was framed and enacted in\r\nspite of great resistance from the Whigs.  This has undoubtedly\r\nproved a good policy, and has prevailed in Massachusetts ever\r\nsince, and now prevails largely throughout the country.\r\n\r\nBut this one measure was not enough to hold together elements\r\notherwise so discordant.  So the Democratic and Free Soil\r\nleaders agreed to call a convention to revise the Constitution\r\nof the Commonwealth, which had remained unchanged save in\r\na few particulars since 1780.  There had been a Convention\r\nfor that purpose in 1820, made necessary by the separation\r\nof Maine.  But the old Constitution had been little altered.\r\nThe concentration of the population in large towns and cities\r\nhad caused a demand for a new distribution of political power.\r\nMany people desired an elective judiciary.  Others desired\r\nthat the judges should hold office for brief terms instead\r\nof the old tenure for life.  There was a great demand for\r\nthe popular election of Sheriffs and District Attorneys, who\r\nunder the existing system were appointed by the Governor.\r\nOthers desired the choice of Senators, who had before been\r\nchosen by the several counties on a joint ticket, by single\r\ndistricts.  A proposition for a Convention was submitted to\r\nthe people by the Legislature of 1851.  But the people were\r\nattached to the old Constitution.  There was a special dread\r\nof any change in the independent tenure of the judiciary.\r\nSo although the coalition had a majority in the State the\r\nproposition for a Constitutional Convention was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was renewed the next year in the Legislature of\r\n1852, of which I was a member.  Several of the Free Soilers,\r\namong which I was included, were unwilling to have the matter\r\ntried again without a distinct assurance that there should\r\nbe no meddling with the judiciary.  This assurance was given\r\nin the report of a joint committee of the Legislature to whom\r\nthe matter was committed, consisting of the leaders of the\r\nDemocratic and Republican parties, who reported that there\r\nwas no purpose to change the judicial tenure with which the\r\npeople were well satisfied.  Accordingly I voted for it.  The\r\nmeasure got a bare majority in the House which it would never\r\nwould have had without that stipulation.  The plan was submitted\r\nto the people again with a proposition that the choice of\r\ndelegates to the Constitutional Convention should be by secret\r\nballot.  The people approved the plan by a substantial majority.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the pledge above mentioned was made in\r\ngood faith and that the men who made it meant to keep it.\r\nBut before the Convention met two things happened which changed\r\nthe conditions.  The coalition was wrecked.  There were two\r\ncauses for its overthrow.  One of them was the appointment\r\nby Governor Boutwell of Caleb Cushing to a seat on the Supreme\r\nBench of Massachusetts.  General Cushing was a man of great\r\naccomplishment, though never a great lawyer.  He could collect\r\nwith wonderful industry all the facts bearing on any historic\r\nquestion and everything that had been said on either side\r\nof any question of law.  But he never had a gift of cogent\r\nargument that would convince any judge or jury.  He owed\r\nhis success in life largely to the personal favor of men who\r\nknew him and were charmed by his agreeable quality.  He was\r\nregarded by the people of Massachusetts as a man without moral\r\nconvictions and as utterly subservient to the slave power.\r\nSo his appointment was a great shock to the Anti-Slavery men\r\nand made them believe that it was not safe to put political\r\npower in Democratic hands.  General Cushing vindicated this\r\nopinion afterward by the letter written when he was Attorney-\r\nGeneral in the Cabinet of President Pierce declaring that\r\nthe Anti-Slavery movement in the North \"must be crushed out,\"\r\nand also by a letter written to Jefferson Davis after the\r\nbeginning of the Rebellion recommending some person to him\r\nfor some service to the Confederacy.  The discovery of this\r\nletter compelled President Grant who had been induced to nominate\r\nhim for Chief Justice to withdraw the nomination.  The other\r\ncause was the passage of the bill for the prohibition of the\r\nmanufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, known as the Maine\r\nlaw.  This measure had passed the Legislature, containing\r\na provision for its submission to the people.  It was vetoed\r\nby Governor Boutwell.  The reason assigned by him was his\r\nobjection to the provision for its submission to the people,\r\nwithout the secret ballot.  The referendum, a scheme by which\r\nmen charged with political duties avoid responsibility by\r\nsubmitting to the people measures which they fear may be unpopular,\r\n--has never found much favor in Massachusetts.  After many\r\nchanges of sentiment, and after passing, modifying, and repealing\r\nmany laws, the people of the Commonwealth seem to have settled\r\ndown on a policy which permits each town or city to decide\r\nby vote whether the sale of liquor shall be permitted within\r\ntheir limits.  The bill was then passed, without the reference\r\nto the people.  But the measure sealed the fate of the coalition.\r\nSome of its provisions, especially that for seizing and destroying\r\nstocks of liquor kept for sale in violation of law, were very\r\nsevere, and were held unconstitutional by the Court.  The\r\nliquor sellers, almost all of them, were Democrats.  They\r\nwould not readily submit to a law which made their calling\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nSo the Whigs were restored to power by the fall election\r\nin 1852.  Their heads were turned by their success.  They\r\ndid not quite dare to repeal the law providing for a Constitutional\r\nConvention, but they undertook to repeal so much of it as\r\nrequired that the choice of delegates should be by secret\r\nballot.  The minority resisted this repeal with all their\r\nmight.  They alleged with great reason that it was not decent\r\nfor the Legislature to repeal a provision which the people\r\nhas expressly approved.  But their resistance was in vain,\r\nand after a long and angry struggle which stirred the people\r\nof the Commonwealth profoundly the provision for the secret\r\nballot was abrogated.  But the result of the contest was that\r\nthe Whigs were routed at the special election for delegates\r\nto the Convention.  That body was controlled by the Coalition\r\nby a very large majority.  Their triumph made them also lose\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nSo when the Convention assembled in 1853, they disregarded\r\nthe pledges which had enabled them to get the assent of the\r\npeople to calling the convention, and provided that the tenure\r\nof office of the Judges of the Supreme Court should be for\r\nten years only, and that the Judges of Probate should be elected\r\nby the people of the several counties once in three years.\r\nIt is said, and, as I have good reason to know, very truly,\r\nthat this action of the Convention was taken in consequence\r\nof a quarrel in Court between the late Judge Merrick and General\r\nButler and Mr. Josiah G. Abbott, two eminent leaders of\r\nthe Democrats, members of the Convention.  They had neither\r\nof them agreed to the proposition to change the judicial tenure.\r\nThey were absent from the convention for several days in\r\nthe trial of an important cause before Merrick, and returned\r\nangry with the Judge and determined to do something to curb\r\nthe independent power of the Judges.  The proposition was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThese schemes were a distinct violation of the pledge which\r\nhad been given when the Legislature submitted to the people\r\nthe proposition for calling the Convention.  Of course it\r\nwas a fair answer to this complaint to say that the members\r\nof the committee who made that report could in such a matter\r\nbind nobody but themselves.  That was true.  But I think if\r\nthe men who signed that report, and the men who joined them\r\nin giving the assurance to the people, had been earnest and\r\nzealous in the matter it is quite likely they could have prevented\r\nthe action of the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe scheme for a new constitution passed the Convention by\r\na large majority and was submitted to the people.  The Whig\r\nleaders, who seemed to have had all their wisdom and energy\r\ntaken out of them when the Free Soilers left them, were much\r\nalarmed by the strength of the discontent with the existing\r\norder of things manifested by the coalition victory in the\r\nelection of the Constitutional Convention.  Many of them concluded\r\nthat it would be unwise to resist the popular feeling.  One\r\nSaturday afternoon during that summer I was in the office\r\nof Francis Wayland, a great friend of mine, long Dean of the\r\nNew Haven Law School, when Henry S. Washburn, a member of\r\nthe Whig State Central Committee, came into Wayland's office\r\nand told me he had just attended a meeting of the Committee\r\nthat day and that it determined to make no contest against\r\nthe new Constitution.  The Springfield _Republican,_ then\r\na Whig journal, had an article that day, or the following\r\nMonday, to the same effect.  I was very much disturbed.  I\r\nhurried to Concord by the first train Monday morning, and\r\nsaw my brother, who was then a Judge of the Court of Common\r\nPleas.  He agreed with me in thinking that the proposed scheme\r\nof government a very bad one.  He went at once to Cambridge\r\nand saw John G. Palfrey, a very able and influential leader\r\nof the Free Soilers.  Mr. Palfrey agreed that the Constitution\r\nought to be defeated, if possible.  Judge Hoar and he sat\r\ndown together and prepared a pamphlet, the Judge furnishing\r\nall the legal argument and Mr. Palfrey the rest, clothing\r\nit all in his inimitable style.  It was published under Dr.\r\nPalfrey's name.  Judge Hoar, being then upon the bench, did\r\nnot think it becoming to take any more public action in the\r\nmatter, although he made his opinion known to all persons\r\nwho cared to know it.  Charles Francis Adams and Marcus Morton\r\nalso made powerful arguments on the same side.  My father,\r\nSamuel Hoar, also made several speeches against the Constitution.\r\nAt this defection of so many Free Soilers the Whig leaders\r\ntook heart and made a vigorous and successful resistance.\r\n\r\nThe result was that the people voted down the whole constitution.\r\nSeveral of the most eminent leaders of the Free Soilers and\r\nDemocrats separated themselves from their party and joined\r\nthe Whigs in defeating it.  Among them were Marcus Morton,\r\nformerly Governor and Judge of the Supreme Court; John G.\r\nPalfrey, who had been the Free Soil candidate for Governor;\r\nCharles Francis Adams, afterward member of Congress and Minister\r\nto England, and Samuel Hoar.\r\n\r\nI was myself, at this time, an enthusiastic Free Soiler,\r\nand was, as I have said, Chairman of the Republican County\r\nCommittee, but I joined the rebels against the dominant feeling\r\nof my party.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Constitution was aided, however, undoubtedly\r\nby a very just and righteous proposal which was submitted\r\nto a separate vote of the people, but which had its effect\r\non the feeling in regard to the whole scheme, to prohibit\r\nthe use of any money raised by taxation for sectarian schools.\r\nTo this the Catholic clergy were opposed, and the Catholic\r\nvote, not however then very important in Massachusetts, was\r\ncast against the whole scheme.\r\n\r\nBut the Whigs did not entirely get over the feeling that\r\nsomething must be done to propitiate the desire for change.\r\nAccordingly they, through the Legislature, submitted to the\r\npeople propositions for the election by the people of the\r\ncounties of Sheriffs and District Attorneys who before that\r\ntime had been appointed by the Governor.  These proposals\r\nwere ratified by the people and became part of the Constitution.\r\nI have always thought the change a bad one.  I think the Governor\r\nlikely to make quite as good if not a better choice of Sheriffs\r\nand District Attorneys than the people.  But the objection\r\nto the new system is this.  So long as the State makes the\r\nlaws, the State, whether acting by a popular vote or through\r\nits executive, should have the power to enforce them and select\r\nthe instrumentalities for that purpose.  Now if the particular\r\nlaw which the State enacts be unpopular in a particular county,\r\nand the people be determined to defeat it, no Sheriff or District\r\nAttorney can be elected who will enforce it.  That has been\r\nshown in the case of the legislation to prohibit or regulate\r\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors in Suffolk County.  Those\r\nlaws have been always unpopular and since the change in the\r\nmode of appointment of District Attorneys and Sheriffs have\r\nnot been enforced until they were modified to meet the popular\r\nobjections.  This difficulty applies also to the enforcing\r\nof laws for the employment of children in factories.  The\r\nLegislature undertook to meet this difficulty by creating\r\nofficials, called State Constables, to be appointed by the\r\nGovernor and to enforce the liquor laws and the laws regulating\r\nchild labor.  But that did not wholly cure the evil.  The\r\nofficials appointed solely to enforce a law against which\r\nthere are strong objections in any quarter are always themselves\r\nunpopular.  The Sheriffs have been from the beginning officials\r\nof great dignity, commanding popular respect and confidence.\r\nSo if it were difficult to enforce the law the character of\r\nthe Sheriff was a great force on its side.  But in the case\r\nof these particular laws persons of less dignity and authority,\r\noften quite obscure when they are appointed, whose whole duty\r\nis odious to the persons to be affected by it, instead of\r\ngiving dignity to the law tend to make it unpopular by their\r\nattempts to enforce it.  Indeed in my opinion the Massachusetts\r\nConstitution of 1780 was as nearly a perfect system of government\r\nas was ever devised.  Some changes in it were made necessary\r\nby the separation of Maine.  I suppose the abrogation of the\r\nprovision that every man should pay a tax for the support\r\nof public worship somewhere was demanded by a public sentiment\r\nit would have been impossible to resist, and undoubtedly the\r\naggregation of population in the large cities and towns required\r\na change in the system of representation.  But I think the\r\nold method of electing Senators, where it was necessary that\r\na man should have a reputation through an entire county to\r\nbe chosen, to be better than the system of electing them by\r\nsmall single districts, and I think the slight property qualification\r\nwas highly useful as a stimulant to saving and economy.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a great pity that the labors of this Constitutional\r\nConvention were wasted.  It was a very able body of men.  With\r\nthe exception of the Convention that framed the Constitution\r\nin the beginning, and the Convention which revised it in 1820,\r\nafter the separation from Maine, I doubt whether so able a\r\nbody of men ever assembled in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\r\nor, with very few exceptions indeed, in the entire country.\r\nThe debates, which are preserved in three thick and almost\r\nforgotten volumes, are full of instructive and admirable essays\r\non the theory of constitutional government.  Among the members\r\nwere Rufus Choate, Charles Sumner, Henry Wilson, George N.\r\nBriggs, Marcus Morton, Marcus Morton, Jr., Henry L. Dawes,\r\nCharles Allen, George S. Hillard, Richard H. Dana, George\r\nS. Boutwell, Otis P. Lord, Peleg Sprague, Simon Greenleaf,\r\nand Sidney Bartlett.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many interesting incidents not, I believe,\r\nrecorded in the report of the debates, which are worth preserving.\r\n\r\nOne was a spirited reply made by George S. Hillard to Benjamin\r\nF. Butler, who had bitterly attacked Chief Justice Shaw, then\r\nan object of profound reverence to nearly the whole people\r\nof the Commonwealth.  Butler spoke of his harsh and rough\r\nmanner of dealing with counsel.  To which Hillard replied,\r\npointing at Butler:  \"While we have jackals and hyenas at\r\nthe bar, we want the old lion upon the bench, with one blow\r\nof his huge paw to bring their scalps over their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nHillard was an accomplished and eloquent man, \"of whom,\" Mr.\r\nWebster said in the Senate of the United States, \"the best\r\nhopes are to be entertained.\"  But he lacked vigor and courage\r\nto assert his own opinions against the social influences of\r\nBoston, which were brought to bear with great severity on\r\nthe anti-slavery leaders.\r\n\r\nHillard was not so fortunate in another encounter.  He undertook\r\nto attack Richard H. Dana, and to reproach him for voting\r\nfor a scheme of representation which somewhat diminished the\r\nenormous political power of Boston. She elected all her representatives\r\non one ballot, and had a power altogether disproportionate\r\nto that of the country.  He said, speaking of Dana: \"He should\r\nremember that the bread he and I both eat comes from the business\r\nmen of Boston.  He ought not, like an ungrateful child, to\r\nstrike at the hand that feeds him.\" Dana replied with great\r\nindignation, ending with the sentence:  \"The hand that feeds\r\nme--the hand that feeds me, sir?  No hand feeds me that has\r\na right to control my opinions!\"\r\n\r\nA _bon mot_ of Henry Wilson is also worth putting on record.\r\nSomebody, who was speaking of the importance of the Massachusetts\r\ntown meeting, said that it was not merely a place for town\r\ngovernment alone, but that it was a place where the people\r\nof the town met from scattered and sometimes secluded dwelling-\r\nplaces to cultivate each other's acquaintance, to talk over\r\nthe news of the day and all matters of public interest; and\r\nthat it was a sort of farmers' exchange, where they could\r\ncompare notes on the state of agriculture, and even sometimes\r\nswap oxen.  Governor Briggs, who had been beaten as a candidate\r\nfor reelection by the Coalition, replied to this speech and\r\nsaid, referring to the Coalition, \"that the gentlemen on the\r\nother side seemed to have carried their trading and swapping\r\nof oxen into politics, and into the high offices of the state.\"\r\nTo which Henry Wilson answered, referring to Briggs's own\r\nloss of his office, \"that so long as the people were satisfied\r\nwith the trade, it did not become the oxen to complain.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the ablest member of the Convention was Charles\r\nAllen.  He spoke seldom and briefly, but always with great\r\nauthority and power.  Late in the proceedings of the Convention\r\na rule was established limiting the speakers to thirty minutes\r\neach.  Hillard, who was one of the delegates from Boston, made\r\na very carefully prepared speech on some pending question.\r\nAllen closed the debate, making no reference whatever to Hillard's\r\nelaborate and most eloquent argument, until he was about to\r\nsit down, when he said: \"Mr. President, I believe my time\r\nis up?\" The President answered: \"The gentleman from Worcester\r\nhas two minutes more.\"  \"Two minutes!\" exclaimed Allen.  \"Time\r\nenough to answer the gentleman from Boston.\" And he proceeded\r\nin that brief period to deal a few strokes with his keen scimitar,\r\nwhich effectually demolished Hillard's elaborate structure.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the political excitements of recent years\r\nwhich approaches in intensity that of the period from 1848\r\nuntil the breaking out of the War.  The people of Massachusetts\r\nfelt the most profound interest in the great conflict between\r\nslavery and freedom for the possession of the vast territory\r\nbetween the Mississippi and the Pacific.  But almost every\r\nman in Massachusetts felt the Fugitive Slave Law as a personal\r\ndishonor.  I think no great public calamity, not the death\r\nof Webster, not the death of Sumner, not the loss of great\r\nbattles during the War, brought such a sense of gloom over\r\nthe whole State as the surrender of Anthony Burns and of Sims.\r\nWorcester, where I dwelt, was the centre and stronghold of\r\nthe anti-slavery feeling in Massachusetts.  This odious statute\r\nwas, perhaps, the greatest single cause of the union of the\r\npeople of the North in opposition to the further encroachments\r\nof slavery.  Yet but two slaves were taken back into slavery\r\nfrom Massachusetts by reason of its provisions.  I will not\r\nundertake to tell the story of those years which will form\r\nan important chapter in the history of the country.  But I\r\nhad a special knowledge of two occurrences which are alluded\r\nto by Colonel Higginson in his charming essay entitled, \"Cheerful\r\nYesterdays,\" in regard to which that most delightful writer\r\nand admirable gentleman has fallen into some slight errors\r\nof recollection.\r\n\r\nThe first person seized under the Fugitive Slave Law was a\r\nslave named Shadrach.  He was brought to trial before George\r\nT. Curtis, United States Commissioner.  One of the chief complaints\r\nagainst the Fugitive Slave Law was that it did not give the\r\nman claimed as a slave, where his liberty and that of his\r\nposterity were at stake, the right to a jury trial which the\r\nConstitution secured in all cases of property involving more\r\nthan twenty dollars, or in all cases where he was charged\r\nwith the slightest crime or offence.  Further, the Commissioner\r\nwas to receive twice as much if the man were surrendered into\r\nslavery as if he were discharged.  Horace Mann, in one of\r\nhis speeches, commented on this feature of the law with terrible\r\nseverity.  He also pointed out that the Commissioner was not\r\na judicial officer with an independent tenure, but only the\r\ncreature of the courts and removable at any time.  He also\r\ndwelt upon what he conceived to be the unfair dealing of the\r\nCommissioners who had presided at the trial of the three\r\nslaves who had been tried in Massachusetts, and added: \"Pilate,\r\nfellow-citizens, was at least a Judge, though he acted like\r\na Commissioner.\"\r\n\r\nElizur Wright, a well-known Abolitionist, editor of the _Chronotype,_\r\nwas indicted in the United States Court for aiding in the\r\nrescue of Shadrach.  While the hearing before Geo. T. Curtis\r\non the proceedings for the rendition of Shadrach was going\r\non, a large number of men, chiefly negroes, made their way\r\ninto the court-room by one door, swept through, taking the\r\nfugitive along with them, and out at the other, leaving the\r\nindignant Commissioner to telegraph to Mr. Webster in Washington\r\nthat he thought it was a case of levying war.  I went into\r\nthe court-room during the trial of Mr. Wright, and saw seated\r\nin the front row of the jury, wearing a face of intense gravity,\r\nmy old friend Francis Bigelow, always spoken of in Concord\r\nas \"Mr. Bigelow, the blacksmith.\"  He was a Free Soiler and\r\nhis wife a Garrison Abolitionist.  His house was a station\r\non the underground railroad where fugitive slaves were harbored\r\non their way to Canada.  Shadrach had been put into a buggy\r\nand driven out as far as Concord, and kept over night by Bigelow\r\nat his house, and sent on his way toward the North Star the\r\nnext morning.  Richard H. Dana, who was counsel for Elizur\r\nWright, asked Judge Hoar what sort of man Bigelow was.  To\r\nwhich the Judge replied: \"He is a thoroughly honest man, and\r\nwill decide the case according to the law and the evidence\r\nas he believes them to be.  But I think it will take a good\r\ndeal of evidence to convince him that one man owns another.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, pertinent to my personal recollections\r\nbut it may be worth while to tell my readers that Theodore\r\nParker, Wendell Phillips, and some others were indicted afterward\r\nfor participation in an intended rescue of Anthony Burns,\r\nanother fugitive slave.  The indictment was quashed by Judge\r\nCurtis, who had probably got pretty sick of the whole thing.\r\nBut Parker, while in jail awaiting trial, prepared a defence,\r\nwhich is printed, and which is one of the most marvellous\r\nexamples of scathing and burning denunciation to be found\r\nin all literature.  I commend it to young men as worth their\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nSome time after the Shadrach case, Asa O. Butman, a United\r\nStates Deputy Marshal, who had been quite active and odious\r\nin the arrest and extradition of Burns, came to Worcester\r\none Saturday afternoon, and stopped at the American Temperance\r\nHouse.  This was October 30, 1854.  It was believed that he\r\nwas in search of information about some fugitive negroes who\r\nwere supposed to be in Worcester, and I suppose that to be\r\nthe fact, although it was claimed that his errand was to summon\r\nwitnesses against persons concerned in the riot which took\r\nplace when Burns was captured.  The fact of his presence became\r\nknown in the course of the day on Sunday, and a pretty angry\r\ncrowd began to gather in the streets in the neighborhood of\r\nthe American House.  Butman learned his danger, and took refuge\r\nin the City Marshal's office in the City Hall, where the police\r\nforce of the city were gathered for his protection.  No attack\r\nwas made during the night, but it was not deemed prudent to\r\nhave Butman leave his shelter.  I had been to Concord to spend\r\nSunday with my kindred there.  I got to Worcester at nine\r\no'clock Monday morning, and was told at the station of the\r\ncondition of things.  I went immediately to the City Hall,\r\nmade my way through the crowd to the building, and was admitted\r\nto the police office by the City Marshal, who was my client,\r\nand apt to depend on me for legal advice.  I found Butman\r\nin a state of great terror.  It was evident that the crowd\r\nwas too large for any police force which the little city had\r\nin its service.  Unless it should be pacified, something was\r\nlikely to happen which we should all have much regretted.\r\nI accordingly went out and addressed the crowd from the steps\r\nof the City Hall.  They listened to me respectfully enough.\r\nI was pretty well known through the city as an earnest Free\r\nSoiler, and as sharing the public feeling of indignation\r\nagainst the delivering up of fugitives.  I reminded the crowd\r\nthat my father and sister had been expelled from Charleston,\r\nS. C., where he had gone at the risk of his life to defend\r\nMassachusetts colored sailors who were imprisoned there, and\r\nappealed to them not to give the people of South Carolina\r\nthe right to excuse their own conduct by citing the example\r\nof Massachusetts.  There were shouts from the crowd: \"Will\r\nhe promise to leave Worcester and never come back?\" Butman,\r\nwho was inside, terribly frightened, said he would promise\r\nnever to come to Worcester again as long as he lived.  I did\r\nnot, however, repeat Butman's promise to the crowd.  I thought\r\nhe ought to go without conditions.  The time approached for\r\nthe train to pass through Worcester for Boston.  It went from\r\na little wooden station near the site of the present Union\r\nDepot, about half a mile from the City Hall.  It was determined,\r\non consultation, to take advantage of an apparently pacific\r\nmood of the crowd, and to start Butman at once for the station\r\nin time to catch the train.  I took one arm and I am quite\r\nsure Colonel Higginson took the other; a few policemen went\r\nahead and a few behind; and we started from the back door\r\nof the City Hall.  The mob soon found what we were after and\r\nthronged around us.  It has been estimated that a crowd of\r\ntwo thousand people at least surrounded Butman and his convoy.\r\nI suppose he had no friend or defender among the number.  Most\r\nof them wanted to frighten him; some of them to injure him,\r\nthough not to kill him.  There were a few angry negroes, I\r\nsuppose, excited and maddened by their not unnatural or unjustifiable\r\nresentment against the fellow who had been the ready and notorious\r\ntool of the slave-catchers, who would have killed him if\r\nthey could.  He was kicked several times by persons who succeeded\r\nin the swaying and surging of the crowd, in getting through\r\nhis guard, and once knocked onto his knees by a heavy blow\r\nin the back of the neck which came from a powerful negro,\r\nwho had a stone in his hand which increased the force of the\r\nblow.  I believe he was hit also by some missiles.  He reached\r\nthe depot almost lifeless with terror.  The train was standing\r\nthere, and started just after we arrived.  It was impossible\r\nto get him into it.  It was then endeavored to put him into\r\na buggy which was standing outside of the depot, but the owner,\r\na young business man of Worcester, seized the bridle of his\r\nhorse and stoutly refused to allow the horse to start.  Butman\r\nwas then thrust into a hack, into which one or two other persons\r\nalso got, and the hack was driven rapidly through the crowd\r\nwith no damage but the breaking of the windows.  Mr. Higginson\r\nthought Butman was left at Westboro'; but my recollection,\r\nwhich is very distinct, and with which I think he now agrees,\r\nis that Lovell Baker, the City Marshal, followed with his\r\nown horse and buggy, and took Butman from the hack after he\r\ngot a short distance out of Worcester.  Butman implored him\r\nnot to leave him at the way-station, fearing that the crowd\r\nwould come down in an accommodation train, which went also\r\nabout that time, and waylay him there.  So Baker drove him\r\nthe whole distance to Boston, forty miles.  When Butman got\r\nto the city, he was afraid that the news of the Worcester\r\nriot might have reached Boston, and have excited the people\r\nthere; and, by his earnest solicitation, Baker took Butman\r\nby unfrequented streets across the city to a place where he\r\nthought he could be concealed until the excitement abated.\r\nBaker, who died a short time ago in Worcester, aged over ninety,\r\ntold me the whole story immediately on his return.\r\n\r\nThe proceeding undoubtedly was not to be justified; but it\r\nwas a satisfaction to know that no slave-hunter came to Worcester\r\nafter that occurrence.  Five or six people--including, if\r\nI am not mistaken, Mr. Higginson himself, certainly including\r\nJoseph A. Howland, a well-known Abolitionist and non-resistant,\r\nand also including Martin Stowell, who was afterward indicted\r\nfor killing Batchelder, a Marshal who took part in the rendition\r\nof Burns--were complained of before the police court, and\r\nbound over to await the action of the grand jury.  The grand\r\njury returned no indictment, except against one colored man.\r\nMr. District Attorney Aldrich was quite disgusted at this,\r\nand promptly _nol prossed_ that indictment.  And so ended\r\nthe famous Butman riot.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were in a minority in Massachusetts after the year\r\n1848.  But the constitution required a majority of all the\r\nvotes to elect a Governor; and, in the case of no choice, the\r\nGovernor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Executive Council,\r\nand the Senators from counties where there had been no election\r\nwere chosen on joint ballot by the members elected to the\r\ntwo Houses.  The Whigs were able to carry the Legislature,\r\nand in that way chose their Governor and Lieutenant Governor,\r\nelected Councillors, and filled vacancies in the Senate.  But\r\nthe Free Soil and Democratic leaders were not content to leave\r\nthe power in the hands of the Whig minority.  In 1849 a few\r\nRepresentatives and Senators were chosen to the Legislature\r\nby a union of the Free Soil and Democratic Parties.  In the\r\nautumn of 1850 this arrangement was extended through the State.\r\nThe Whigs were in a minority in the Legislature, and the coalition\r\nproceeded to elect a Democratic Governor and Lieutenant Governor\r\nand an Executive Council.  In consideration of giving these\r\noffices to the Democrats, it was agreed that Mr. Sumner should\r\nbe chosen Senator.  A few of the Democrats, who desired to\r\nkeep their party relations with the South, refused to agree\r\nto this arrangement.  Mr. Winthrop was the Whig candidate.\r\nThe Senate, on its part, promptly elected Mr. Sumner, but\r\nthere was a long contest in the House of Representatives,\r\nextending through three months.  Twenty-six ballots were cast,\r\nof which no candidate had a majority until the last.  Mr.\r\nSumner several times came within two or three votes of an\r\nelection.  At last it was apparent that some member had cast\r\nmore than one vote; and an order was offered by Sidney Bartlett,\r\nan eminent Whig member from Boston, requiring the members\r\nto bring in their votes in sealed envelopes.  This resulted\r\nin the choice of Sumner.\r\n\r\nAnother contribution to Mr. Sumner's election ought not to\r\nbe forgotten.  The town of Fall River was represented by Whigs;\r\nbut it was a community where there was a strong anti-slavery\r\nfeeling.  A town-meeting was called by the friends of Mr.\r\nSumner, and a motion made to instruct their representatives,\r\naccording to the right of the people declared in the constitution\r\nof Massachusetts, to vote for Sumner.  An earnest and eloquent\r\nspeech in favor of the resolution was made by Robert T. Davis,\r\na young Quaker, since a distinguished member of Congress.\r\nThe resolution was carried, which Mr. Borden, one of the\r\nRepresentatives from Fall River, obeyed.  The result was Sumner's\r\nelection by a single vote.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the preceding chapter, I was a member in 1852\r\nof the Massachusetts House of Representatives, then consisting\r\nof about four hundred and twenty members.  It was, I think,\r\nas admirable a body of men for the training of a public speaker\r\nas I ever knew.  The members were honest.  The large majority\r\nwas made up of sensible, strong-headed country farmers, rather\r\nslow in making up their minds, but making them up always on\r\nconsiderations of what was best for the Commonwealth.  There\r\nwas a time, when the opinion of the House seemed to be precipitating\r\nor crystallizing, not too early in the debate and not too\r\nlate, when a vigorous and effective speech had great influence.\r\nI was made Chairman of the Committee of Probate and Chancery,\r\nthe second law committee in the House; and I suppose it is\r\nnot presumptuous to say that I did as much of the hard work\r\nof the body and had as much influence in leading its action\r\nand shaping its legislation as anybody.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1856 I was, with Eli Thayer, sent from Worcester\r\nas a delegate to a Convention held at Buffalo to concert measures\r\nto help the settlers from the Free States in their contest\r\nwith slave owners led by Atchison and Stringfellow, of Missouri,\r\nfor the possession of Kansas.  Atchison had been President\r\npro tempore of the Senate of the United States.  The slave\r\nholders had organized a formidable body of men to drive out\r\nthe Free State settlers from the Territories, which had just\r\nbeen opened after the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.  We\r\nmet at Buffalo some gentlemen, among whom was Zachariah Chandler,\r\nof Michigan, then in the vigor of early manhood.  We made\r\narrangements for getting large contributions of money and\r\narms with which the Northern emigrants were equipped, and\r\nwhich undoubtedly enabled them to maintain successfully their\r\nresistance and establish their free State.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE KNOW NOTHING PARTY AND ITS OVERTHROW\r\n\r\nThe political history of Massachusetts from 1846 to 1865\r\nis, in general, the history of the share of the Commonwealth\r\nin the great National contest with Slavery; the beginning\r\nand growth of the Free Soil or Republican Party and the putting\r\ndown of the Rebellion.  The rise and dominion for three years,\r\nand the final overthrow of the Know Nothing Party is an episode\r\nwhich should not be wholly omitted, although it is an episode\r\nwhich might be omitted without injury to the sense.\r\n\r\nThere have been, ever since the Irish immigration which begun\r\nsomewhere about 1840 down to to-day, a great many worthy people\r\nwho have been afraid of the Pope and the influence of Catholicism\r\nin this country, and have been exceedingly jealous of the\r\ninfluence of foreigners, especially of those of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church.  Self-seeking political adventurers and demagogues\r\nhave not been slow to take advantage of this feeling for their\r\nown purposes.  They have, for some reason, always preferred\r\nto make their political movement in secret societies.  The\r\nCatholic vote had generally been cast for the Democrats, and\r\nwas supposed to be largely influenced by the Catholic clergy.\r\nIt was thought that this influence had a good deal to do with\r\ndefeating Mr. Clay in 1844.  A movement of this kind swept\r\nover the country after the Presidential election of 1852.\r\nIt had nearly spent its force by 1856.  It made little headway\r\nat the South, except in two or three States.  There was a\r\nstruggle with it in Virginia, where it was defeated by the\r\nsuperhuman energy of Henry A. Wise.  The party organized for\r\nthe purpose of excluding men of foreign birth from any share\r\nin the Government, sometimes called the American Party, was\r\ngenerally called the Know-Nothing Party, a name which came\r\nfrom the answer each member was expected to make to any inquiry\r\nfrom an outsider, \"I know nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\nThis party swept Massachusetts in the autumn of 1854.  It\r\nelected in that year Governor, Lieutenant Governor, all the\r\nofficers of the State Government, every member of both Houses\r\nof the Legislature, except two from the town of Northampton,\r\nand every member of Congress.  Its candidate for Governor\r\nwas Henry J. Gardner, a very skilful political organizer.\r\nHe had a book in which he had the names of men in every town\r\nin the Commonwealth whom he attached to his personal fortunes\r\nby promises, or flattery, or because in some cases of their\r\nsincere belief in the doctrine.  He understood better than\r\nany other man I ever knew the value of getting the united\r\nsupport of men who were without special influence, even the\r\nman who were odious or ridiculous among their own neighbors,\r\nbut who united might be a very formidable force.  He organized\r\nwith great skill and success the knave-power and the donkey-\r\npower of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nBut a good many Anti-Slavery men who thought the party feeling\r\nof the Whigs and Democrats was a great obstacle to their cause,\r\njoined the movement simply in order that they might get rid\r\nof the old parties, and prepare the State as with a subsoil\r\nplow for a new one.  They had no belief in the proscriptive\r\ndoctrines, and were willing that men of foreign birth and\r\nCatholics should have their just rights, and expected to destroy\r\nthe Know Nothing Party in its turn when it had destroyed Whiggery\r\nand Democracy.  Of these was Henry Wilson, who owed his first\r\nelection to the Senate to the Know Nothing Legislature; and\r\nEli Thayer, who had been the organizer of the Emigrant Aid\r\nSociety, and the movement for the deliverance of Kansas and\r\nNebraska.  Both these gentlemen abandoned the Know Nothing\r\nParty the year after its formation.  Mr. Thayer was elected\r\nas a Republican to Congress in 1856, and reelected in 1858.\r\nBut he separated from his political associates and espoused\r\nthe squatter sovereignty doctrines of Stephen A. Douglas.\r\nHe, I have no doubt, was a sincere Anti-Slavery man.  But\r\nhe liked to do things in peculiar and original ways of his\r\nown, and was impatient of slow and old-fashioned methods.\r\nSo he got estranged from his Republican brethren, was defeated\r\nas a candidate for Congress in 1860, took no part in public\r\nactivities during the time of the war, became somewhat soured,\r\nand landed in the Democratic Party.  I always had a great\r\nliking for him, and deem him entitled to great public gratitude\r\nfor his services in the rescue of Kansas from what was known\r\nas Border Ruffianism.\r\n\r\nNeither Charles Sumner nor Charles Allen ever tolerated the\r\nKnow Nothing movement or made any terms with it.  Its proscriptiveness\r\nand its secrecy were alike repugnant to their honest, brave\r\nand liberty-loving souls.  Sumner was advised, as the question\r\nof his reelection was coming on in January, 1857, to keep\r\nsilent about Know Nothingism.  He was told that the Slavery\r\nquestion was enough for one man to deal with, and that if\r\nhe would only hold his peace all the parties would unite in\r\nhis reelection.  He answered the advice with his brave challenge.\r\nHe went about the Commonwealth, denouncing the intolerant\r\nand proscriptive doctrine of the Know Nothings.  He told them:\r\n\"You have no real principle on which you can stand.  You are\r\nnothing but a party of Gardnerites.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Allen addressed a little company, of which I was\r\none, in the City Hall at Worcester in the autumn of 1854,\r\nwhen Know Nothingism was in the height of its strength.  He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am speaking too boldly, but I learned to speak\r\nboldly a long time ago.  I will speak my sentiments in the\r\nface of any organization; or, if it does not show its face,\r\nthough its secret mines are beneath my feet, and unseen hands\r\nready to apply the match, I will declare those sentiments\r\nthat a freeman is bound to utter.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of Massachusetts elected Gardner Governor in 1854,\r\n1855 and 1856.  But in the autumn of 1857 he was beaten under\r\nthe leadership of General Banks.  The party lingered until\r\n1856 when there was an attempt to keep it alive in the Presidential\r\ncampaign of that year when Millard Fillmore was its candidate\r\nfor the Presidency.\r\n\r\nBut it was destroyed in the consuming fire kindled by the\r\nCivil War, and has not since been heard of by its old name.\r\n\r\nThe proscriptive and intolerant opposition to Catholicism,\r\nespecially against men of foreign birth, has shown its head\r\noccasionally.  It appeared in its most formidable shape in\r\na secret organization known as the A. P. A., of which I shall\r\nspeak later.  It is utterly uncongenial to the spirit of true\r\nAmericanism, and will never have any considerable permanent\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nELECTION TO CONGRESS\r\n\r\nIn the year 1868 one chapter of my life ended and a very\r\ndifferent one began.  In the beginning of that year I had\r\nno doubt that what remained of my life would be devoted to\r\nmy profession, and to discharging as well as I could the\r\nduties of good citizenship in the community to which I was\r\nso strongly attached.  But it was ordered otherwise.  My\r\nlife in Worcester came to an end, and I shall if I live to\r\ncomplete my present term in the Senate have spent thirty-\r\neight years in the National service.\r\n\r\nThis came from no ambition of mine.  In May, 1868, I sailed\r\nfor Europe, broken down in health by hard work.  During my\r\nabsence, some of the leading Republicans of the District issued\r\nan appeal recommending me as a candidate for Congress.  There\r\nwere five or six other candidates.  They were all of them\r\nmen of great popularity, with hosts of friends and supporters.\r\nAmong them was John D. Baldwin, then holding the seat, a veteran\r\nin the Anti-Slavery Service, editor of the Worcester _Spy,_\r\none of the most influential papers in New England.  It had\r\nbeen the almost unvarying custom of the people of Massachusetts\r\nto reelect an old member who had served as faithfully as Mr.\r\nBaldwin.  Another candidate was Francis W. Bird, one of the\r\nfounders of the Anti-Slavery Party, and a man who had been\r\na powerful supporter by speech and pen and wise counsel and\r\nlarge influence of the Republican Party since its foundation.\r\nHe was supported by the powerful influence of Charles Sumner,\r\nthen at the height of his popularity, and by Adin Thayer,\r\nthe ablest political organizer in Massachusetts.  Another\r\ncandidate was Amasa Walker, the eminent writer on political\r\neconomy, whose name has since been rendered still more illustrious\r\nby the brilliant public service of his son.  Another was Mr.\r\nMayhew, a successful manufacturer, of large wealth, and a\r\ndeserved favorite in Milford, the second town in the District,\r\nwhere he resided.  Another still was Lucius W. Pond, a generous\r\nand warm-hearted man, although he afterward fell from his\r\nhigh place.  He was a Methodist.  That denomination had always\r\nbeen strong and influential in the Worcester District, and\r\nits members have always stood stanchly by the men of their\r\nown household when candidates for political office.  Mr. Pond\r\nwas also a member of the Masonic Order and of other secret\r\nassociations.  I ought however to say, in justice to the Masonic\r\nFraternity, that I have never been able to see that there\r\nwas any truth whatever in the charge that the members of that\r\nOrder deemed it their duty to support each other in politics,\r\nor when on juries.  Many a client has told me with great alarm\r\nthat his opponent was a Mason, and that one or more leading\r\nMasons were on the jury that were to try the case.  I always\r\nrefused to challenge a juryman on that account, and I never\r\nfound that the man's being a Mason had the least effect in\r\npreventing him from rendering a just verdict.  I have many\r\nintimate friends both political and personal in that Order,\r\nalthough I never belonged to it and never sympathized with\r\nor approved of secret societies in a Republic.\r\n\r\nMy strength was due to the fact that I had in general the\r\ngood will of my competitors.  So if any one failed to get\r\na majority it was easy to transfer his strength to me.  Perhaps\r\nalso there was a feeling, growing out of the fact that I had\r\nhad great experience in public speaking at the Bar and in\r\npolitical meetings, that I might be able to take a prominent\r\npart in the debates in the House, a faculty which all my competitors\r\nlacked, except Mr. Bird.  But chiefly I had the advantage\r\nof the good will of my associates in my own profession, a\r\nbody whose influence is always justly very powerful and who\r\nwere all, with scarcely an exception, my close and strong\r\nfriends.  I had, beside all that, a great many clients in\r\nevery town in the District who had been in the habit of trusting\r\nme with their most intimate and secret concerns, and with\r\nwhom I had formed the attachment which in those days used\r\nto exist between counsel and client.\r\n\r\nI had said before I went to Europe that if nominated I would\r\naccept the office.  I thought it doubtful whether my strength\r\nwould permit me to continue my professional work without interruption.\r\nI had no thought of remaining in Congress, if I were elected,\r\nmore than one term, or perhaps two.  Indeed I did not contemplate\r\nthe probability of a nomination as a very serious one.\r\n\r\nBut almost before I got out of the sight of land the burden\r\nlifted and my health came back.  When I got home I was utterly\r\nsick of the whole business.  But my friends had been committed\r\nto my support.  They claimed that I could not withdraw honorably\r\nafter the assurance I had given them before I went away.  So,\r\nrather to my disgust, I was nominated on the first formal\r\nballot.  I had not expected the result.  I had gone to take\r\na ride while the Convention was in session.  So they were\r\nobliged to wait for me.  I was found with some difficulty\r\nand went in and made a brief speech which I ended by saying:\r\n\"If I shall fail to satisfy you, the trust you have so freely\r\nconferred you can as freely recall.  If I shall fail to satisfy\r\nmyself, I shall at least have the comfort of reflecting that\r\nit is by your free choice that this nomination has been conferred.\r\nIt has not been begged for, or bargained for, or intrigued\r\nfor, or crawled into.  If elected I shall at the close of\r\nthe term lay down the honors of the office with the same cheerfulness\r\nwith which I now accept the nomination.\"\r\n\r\nI expected to go back to my home and my profession at the\r\nend of one term.  My law practice was rapidly increasing.\r\nProfessional charges in those days were exceedingly moderate\r\nas compared with the scale of prices now, and I had inherited\r\nthe habit of charging low fees from my partner and friend,\r\nEmory Washburn.  If I had the same class of clients now that\r\nI had then, I could at the present scale of charges for professional\r\nservice easily be earning more than fifty thousand dollars\r\na year, and I could earn it without going to my office in\r\nthe evening, and also take a good vacation every summer.\r\n\r\nMy life from that time has been devoted altogether to the\r\npublic service.  I have, what is commonly expected of men\r\nwho represent Massachusetts in the Senate, delivered a good\r\nmany literary and historical addresses, and have taken part\r\nin political campaigns, and have occasionally eked out a scanty\r\nsalary by some professional work in the vacations.  But I\r\nthink I may fairly claim that I have done my share of the\r\nwork of the Senate and of the House to the best of my ability.\r\nSenator Edmunds when he left the Senate was kind enough to\r\ncompliment me by saying that the whole work of the Senate\r\nwas done by six men, of whom I was one.  I do not suppose\r\nMr. Edmunds meant the number six to be taken literally.  But\r\nhe is a gentleman certainly never given to flattery or empty\r\ncompliment.  So I think I might call him as a witness that,\r\nin his time, so far as hard work is concerned I did my best.\r\nI am not quite so confident that he would testify to the wisdom\r\nof my course on all occasions.\r\n\r\nI did not, as I have said, expect when I entered to remain\r\nin public life more than one term.  But I became interested\r\nin the bill known as the National Education Bill, and accepted\r\nanother election with a view to doing what I could to carry\r\nthat through.  At the end of the next term I announced my\r\npurpose to withdraw.  But there was a very earnest letter\r\nto me signed by the principal men in the district, including\r\nseveral gentlemen, any one of whom might very naturally have\r\nexpected to be my successor, saying it was not for the interest\r\nof the people of the district to make a change.\r\n\r\nTwo years after I made a formal and peremptory refusal to\r\nbe a candidate again, which was encountered by a like appeal.\r\nIt was the year of what was called the Tidal Wave which swept\r\nthe Republicans from power in the House of Representatives.\r\nIt was very doubtful whether they could carry the Worcester\r\nDistrict.  The Democrats elected a majority of the Massachusetts\r\ndelegation in the National House of Representatives.  I was\r\nelected by a few hundred only, although I was elected by several\r\nthousand on former occasions.  I could not very well refuse\r\nto accept the nomination at a time of great political peril.\r\nSo I continued once more.  At the end of that time I wrote\r\nanother peremptory refusal, and my successor was nominated\r\nand elected.\r\n\r\nI have been often charged with a blind and zealous attachment\r\nto party.  The charge is sometimes made by persons who consider\r\nthat I desire to do right, but think that my understanding\r\nand intellectual faculties are guided and blinded by that\r\nemotion.  Others are not so charitable.  One very self-satisfied\r\ncritic, Mr. William Lloyd Garrison, sometimes in prose and\r\nsometimes,\r\n\r\n  A screechin' out prosaic verse\r\n  An' like to bust,\r\n\r\nsays that I differ from my honorable colleague, Mr. Lodge,\r\nin that Mr. Lodge has no conscience, while I have a conscience\r\nbut never obey it.  If any man be disposed to accept these\r\nestimates, it is not likely that I can convince him to the\r\ncontrary by my own certificate.  But I will say two things:\r\n\r\n1.  I have never in my life cast a vote or done an act in\r\nlegislation that I did not at the time believe to be right, and\r\nthat I am not now willing to avow and to defend and debate\r\nwith any champion, of sufficient importance, who desires to\r\nattack it at any time and in any presence.\r\n\r\n2.  Whether I am right or wrong in my opinion as to the duty\r\nof acting with and adherence to party, it is the result not\r\nof emotion or attachment or excitement, but of as cool, calculating,\r\nsober and deliberate reflection as I am able to give to any\r\nquestion of conduct or duty.  Many of the things I have done\r\nin this world which have been approved by other men, or have\r\ntended to give me any place in the respect of my countrymen,\r\nhave been done in opposition, at the time, to the party to\r\nwhich I belonged.  But I have made that opposition without\r\nleaving the party.  In every single instance, unless the question\r\nof the Philippine Islands shall prove an exception, and that\r\nis not a settled question yet, the party has come round, in\r\nthe end, to my way of thinking.  I have been able by adhering\r\nto the Republican Party to accomplish, in my humble judgment,\r\nten-fold the good that has been accomplished by men who have\r\nten times more ability and capacity for such service, who\r\nhave left the party.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Boutwell, the President of the Anti-Imperialist\r\nLeague, wrote me that he thought I could do more good for\r\nthat cause by staying in the Republican Party than by leaving\r\nit, and when he declared in a public interview in Boston that\r\nof course Mr. Hoar would remain in the Republican Party, he\r\nwas right.  If he had taken the same course himself, he would\r\nhave been a powerful help in saving his country from what\r\nhas happened.  If the gentlemen who acted with him in that\r\nway had remained Republicans, and the gentlemen who agreed\r\nwith him, who have remained Republicans, who abandoned public\r\nlife, had kept in it, they would have saved the country from\r\nwhat they and I deemed a grievous mistake and calamity.  There\r\nwas but one vote lacking for the defeat of the Spanish Treaty.\r\nThere was but one vote lacking for the passage of the Teller\r\nresolution.  If Mr. Speaker Reed, the most powerful Republican\r\nin the country, next to President McKinley, had stayed in\r\nthe House; if Mr. Harrison, as I earnestly desired, had come\r\nback to the Senate; if Governor Boutwell and Mr. Adams had\r\nuttered their counsel as Republicans, the Republicans would\r\nhave done with the Philippine Islands what we did with Cuba\r\nand Japan.  I could cite a hundred illustrations, were they\r\nneeded, to prove what I say to be true.  There was undoubtedly\r\ngreat corruption and mal-administration in the country in\r\nthe time of President Grant.  Selfish men and ambitious men\r\ngot the ear of that simple and confiding President.  They\r\nstudied Grant, some of them, as the shoemaker measures the\r\nfoot of his customer.  Mr. Sumner and Mr. Schurz and Mr.\r\nTrumbull and Mr. Greeley and the New York _Tribune,_ and\r\nthe Springfield _Republican,_ and the Chicago _Tribune,_ and\r\nthe St. Louis _Republican,_ and scores of other men and other\r\npapers left the party.  They were, so long as they maintained\r\nthat attitude, absolutely without political influence from\r\nthat moment.  When the great reforms which were attempted\r\nwere accomplished, they were not there.  The reforms were\r\naccomplished.  But their names were wanting from the honorable\r\nroll of the men who accomplished them.  President Grant himself\r\nand President Hayes and Judge Hoar and Mr. Cox and General\r\nGarfield, and others, if there are other names honorable enough\r\nto be mentioned along with these, stayed in the Republican\r\nParty.  They purified the administration.  They accomplished\r\ncivil service reform.  They helped to achieve the independence\r\nof American manufacture.  They kept the faith.  They paid\r\nthe debt.  They resumed specie payment.  They maintained a\r\nsound currency, amid great temptation and against great odds.\r\nTo this result our friends who were independent of party contributed\r\nno jot or tittle.\r\n\r\nOur system differs from that which prevails in England in\r\nthat it is hard to change the political power from one party\r\nto another and hard to restore it when it is once lost.  We\r\nelect our President for four years.  We elect our Senators\r\nfor six years.  Therefore in determining whether it is your\r\nduty to forsake a party which is wrong on some single question\r\nyou are to decide, first, whether that question is important\r\nenough to warrant sacrificing every other measure in which\r\nyou agree with your party, and having every measure espoused\r\nby the other which you think bad enacted if it get control.\r\nSecond, you have not only in such cases to sacrifice every\r\nother thing you think desirable to prevent the one thing you\r\nthink undesirable, but you must decide whether, in regard\r\nto that particular matter, the party you are asked to substitute\r\nin power for your own will accomplish what you desire if it\r\nget power.  For example, there are some worthy Republicans\r\nwho are free-traders.  But they agree with the Republican\r\nParty in everything else.  If you ask them to put a Democratic\r\nPresident and Congress into power in order to get free trade\r\nthey must consider whether if they get power they will give\r\nthem free trade.  Otherwise they sacrifice everything else\r\nfor that chance and get no benefit in that respect.  The Republican\r\nfree-trader who voted for Mr. Cleveland in 1892 did not get\r\nfree trade.  He got only what Mr. Cleveland denounced as\r\na measure of infamy.  In the third place you have under our\r\nConstitutional system to determine whether the chance to accomplish\r\nwhat you want in regard to one measure warrants placing the\r\npolitical power in hands you deem unfit, so that the party,\r\nin your judgment right on one thing, but wrong in every other,\r\nwill have the fate of the country in its hands for a four\r\nyears' term, and deal with every new and unexpected question\r\nas it shall think fit.  I was bitterly reproached for supporting\r\nMr. McKinley, and refusing to support Mr. Bryan, when I differed\r\nfrom Mr. McKinley on the great predominant question how we\r\nshould deal with the people of the Philippine Islands.  But\r\nthe men who criticised me most bitterly were some of them\r\nthe men who applauded my purpose to do so when it was first\r\ndeclared.  One of them, the President of the Anti-Imperialist\r\nLeague, wrote me a letter saying that I could be more useful\r\nto that cause by remaining a Republican than in any other\r\nway, and declared in a public interview that of course Mr.\r\nHoar would remain a Republican.  The Secretary of the same\r\norganization, after I had made a speech in which I had declared\r\nmy purpose to continue to support Mr. McKinley, in spite\r\nof his grievous error in this respect, wrote me a letter\r\ncrowded with the most fulsome adulation, and declared that\r\nmy position was as lofty as that of Chatham or Burke.  I\r\ncould cite many other instances to the same effect.  But\r\nwhat other men think, however respectable they may be, is\r\nof course of no importance.  Every man must settle for himself\r\nthe question of his individual duty.  I could not find that\r\nthe chance that Mr. Bryan, who had urged the adoption of the\r\nSpanish Treaty and had committed himself to the opinion that\r\nit was right to do everything we promised to do in that Treaty,\r\nwould act wisely or righteously if he were trusted with power,\r\nor that he could get his party to support him if he were disposed\r\nto do so, warranted my running the risk of the mischief he\r\nwas pledged to accomplish; still less running the risk of\r\ngiving the government of this country to his supporters for\r\nthe next four years.  There are many good men in the Democratic\r\nParty.  But the strength of that organization in 1900, as\r\nit is to-day, was in Tammany Hall, in the old Southern leaders\r\ncommitted to a policy of violence and fraud in dealing with ten\r\nmillion of our American citizens at home, aided by a few\r\nimpracticable dreamers who were even less fitted than the\r\nDemocratic leaders to be trusted with political power.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party, whatever its faults, since it came\r\ninto power in 1860 has been composed in general of what is\r\nbest in our national life.  States like Massachusetts and\r\nVermont, the men of the rural districts in New York, the\r\nsurvivors and children of the men who put down the Rebellion\r\nand abolished slavery, saved the Union, and paid the debt\r\nand kept the faith, and achieved the manufacturing independence\r\nof the country, and passed the homestead laws, are on that\r\nside, and in general they give and will hereafter give direction\r\nto its counsels.  On the other hand their antagonist has been,\r\nis, and for an indefinite time to come will be, controlled\r\nby the foreign population and the criminal classes of our\r\ngreat cities, by Tammany Hall, and by the leaders of the solid\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nI entered the House of Representatives of the United States\r\nat the spring session which began March 4, 1869, at the beginning\r\nof Grant's Administration.  It then contained a very interesting\r\nand important group of men, the most brilliant and conspicuous\r\nof whom was, undoubtedly, Mr. James G. Blaine.  The public,\r\nfriends and foes, judged of him by a few striking and picturesque\r\nqualities.  There has probably never been a man in our history\r\nupon whom so few people looked with indifference.  He was\r\nborn to be loved or hated.  Nobody occupied a middle ground\r\nas to him.  In addition to the striking qualities which caught\r\nthe public eye, he was a man of profound knowledge of our\r\npolitical history, of a sure literary taste, and of great\r\ncapacity as an orator.  He studied and worked out for himself\r\nvery abstruse questions, on which he formed his own opinions,\r\nusually with great sagacity.  How far he was affected in his\r\nposition by the desire for public favor I will not undertake\r\nto say.  I think the constitution of his mind was such that\r\nmatters were apt to strike him in much the same way as they\r\nwere apt to strike the majority of the people of the North,\r\nespecially of the Northwest, where he was always exceedingly\r\npopular.  He maintained very friendly personal relations with\r\nsome of the more intelligent Southerners, especially with\r\nLamar.  One incident in his relations with Butler was intensely\r\namusing.  They were never on very friendly terms, though each\r\nof them found it wise not to break with the other.  When Blaine\r\nwas a candidate for Speaker, to which office he was chosen\r\nin the spring session of 1869, his principal competitor was\r\nHenry L. Dawes.  Dawes's chances were considered excellent\r\nuntil Butler, who had great influence with the Southern Republican\r\nmembers of the House, declared himself for Blaine.  Butler\r\nwas exceedingly anxious to be Chairman of the Committee of\r\nAppropriations.  This would have been an offence in the nostrils\r\nof a large portion of the Republican Party.  Mr. Dawes, learning\r\nButler's proposed defection, was beforehand with him by rising\r\nin the caucus and himself nominating Mr. Blaine.  This secured\r\nBlaine's unanimous nomination.  Butler, however, still pressed\r\neagerly his own claim for the Chairmanship of the Appropriations.\r\nBlaine was altogether too shrewd to yield to that.  The committees\r\nwere not appointed until the following December.  Butler suspected\r\nsomehow that there was doubt about his getting the coveted\r\nprize.  He accordingly went to the door of the Speaker's room,\r\nwhich was then opposite the door of the House of Representatives,\r\nby the side of the Speaker's chair.  He found Blaine's messenger\r\nkeeping the door, who told him that Mr. Blaine was engaged\r\nand could not see anybody.  \"Very well,\" said General Butler,\r\n\"I will wait.\"  Accordingly, he took a chair and seated himself\r\nat the door, so that he might intercept Blaine as he came\r\nout.  Blaine, learning that Butler was there, went out the\r\nwindow, round by the portico, and entered the House by another\r\nentrance.  Somebody came along and, seeing Butler seated in\r\nthe corridor, said: \"What are you about here, General?\"  \"Waiting\r\nfor Blaine,\" was the reply.  \"Blaine is in the chair in the\r\nHouse,\" was the answer.  \"It isn't possible,\" said Butler.\r\n\"Yes, he is just announcing the committees.\"  Butler rushed\r\ninto the House in time to hear Mr. Dawes's name read by the\r\nClerk as the Chairman of Appropriations.  He was very angry,\r\nand bided his time.  They had an altercation over the bill\r\nto protect the rights of the freedmen in the South, the story\r\nof which I tell in speaking of Grant.  But as the end of the\r\nCongress approached, Butler endeavored to get up an alliance\r\nbetween the Democrats and what were called the \"Revenue Reformers.\"\r\nThere was a large number of Northwestern Republicans who were\r\ndisposed to break away from the party because of its policy\r\nof high protection.  This included representatives of a good\r\nmany States that afterward were the most loyal supporters\r\nof the tariff policy.  Butler showed me one day a call he\r\nhad prepared, saying: \"How do you think something like this\r\nwould answer?\"  It was a call for a caucus of all persons\r\nwho desired a reform in the tariff to meet to nominate a\r\ncandidate for Speaker.  I was never in Butler's confidence,\r\nand I suppose he showed me the paper with the expectation\r\nthat I should tell Blaine.  Blaine circumvented the movement\r\nby giving assurances to the friends of revenue reform that\r\nhe would make up a Committee of Ways and Means with a majority\r\nof persons of their way of thinking.  This ended Butler's\r\nmovement.  Blaine kept his word.  Mr. Dawes, a high protectionist,\r\nwas made Chairman, and Mr. Kelly, also a high protectionist,\r\nwas second on the Committee of Ways and Means; but a majority\r\nwere revenue reformers.  The committee reported a bill which\r\nwould have been exceedingly injurious to the protected industries\r\nof New England.  That bill was pressed and reported to the\r\nHouse from the Committee of the Whole; but the member of the\r\ncommittee who had it in charge, by some strange oversight,\r\nforgot to demand the previous question.  Mr. Dawes, quick\r\nas lightning, took from his desk a bill which he had previously\r\nprepared, but which had been voted down by his committee,\r\nadded to it a clause putting tea and coffee on the free list,\r\nand, I believe containing also one or two other items which\r\nwere specially popular in some parts of the country, and moved\r\nthat as an amendment to the committee's bill, and himself\r\ndemanded the previous question.  The cry of a free breakfast-\r\ntable was then specially popular.  There were enough members\r\nwho did not dare to vote against putting tea and coffee on\r\nthe free list to turn the scale.  Dawes's amendment was adopted,\r\nthe bill passed, the New England industries saved, and the\r\ntariff reformers beaten.  The persons who saw only the quiet\r\nand modest bearing with which Mr. Dawes conducted himself\r\nin the Senate do not know with how much vigor, quickness of\r\nwit, readiness and skill in debate, he conducted himself amid\r\nthe stormy sessions of the House of Representatives during\r\nGrant's first Administration.  There has never been, within\r\nmy experience, a greater power than his on the floor of the\r\nHouse.  He had mighty antagonists.  There were not only very\r\nable Democrats, like Randall and Kerr and Holman, but there\r\nwere mighty leaders among the Republicans.  There was little\r\nparty discipline.  Each of them seemed bent on having his\r\nown way and taking care of himself, and ready to trip up or\r\noverthrow any of his rivals without mercy or remorse.  Among\r\nthem were Butler and Farnsworth and Garfield and Logan and\r\nSchenck and Kelly and Banks and Bingham and Sargent and Blaine\r\nand Poland.\r\n\r\nI was not in the habit of going often to the White House\r\nwhen Grant was President.  When I did, he received me always\r\nwith great kindness.  He always seemed to be very fond of\r\nmy brother; and I suppose that led him to receive me in a\r\nmore intimate and cordial fashion than he would otherwise\r\nhave done.  I was first introduced to him in the cloak-room\r\nof the House of Representatives the Saturday evening before\r\nhis inauguration.  He came, I think, to see Mr. Boutwell,\r\nthen a member of the House, afterward his Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  He came to Worcester in the summer of that year,\r\nand I went with him in a special car to Groton in the afternoon.\r\nHe was not very talkative, though interested in all he saw.\r\nHe expressed special delight in the appearance of the boys\r\nof the Worcester Military School, who turned out to escort\r\nhim.  One of his sons, a well-grown lad, was upon the train.\r\nThe general had not seen him for some time, and he sat with\r\none arm around him, as one might with a little girl.\r\n\r\nIt used to be thought that Grant was a man without much literary\r\ncapacity.  Since the publication of his \"Memoirs,\" this notion\r\nhas been discarded.  I can testify to his great readiness\r\nas a writer.  I saw him write two messages to Congress, both\r\nof a good deal of importance, without pause or correction,\r\nand as rapidly as his pen could fly over the paper.  The first\r\nwas the message he sent in on the adoption of the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution.  I was much interested in a\r\nbill in aid of national education.  I called on the President\r\nwhen the last State needed had ratified the Fifteenth Amendment,\r\nand suggested to him that it might be well to send a special\r\nmessage to Congress congratulating them on the result, and\r\nurging the policy of promoting education for the new citizens.\r\nI told him of General Washington's interest in a national\r\nuniversity, and what he had said about the importance of\r\neducation in his writings.  I said I supposed he had them\r\nin his library.  He said he believed he had, but he wished\r\nI would get the books and bring them to him.  I accordingly\r\ngot the books, carried them up to the White House, showed\r\nhim the passages, and Grant sat down and wrote in a few minutes,\r\nand quite rapidly, the message that was sent to Congress the\r\nnext day.  The other occasion was when he sent in the message\r\nat the time of the controversy between the House and the Senate\r\nin regard to the policy to be pursued in dealing with the\r\noutrages in the South.  The Senate had passed a bill giving\r\na discretion to the President to take some firm measures to\r\nsuppress these disorders, and to protect the colored people\r\nand the Republicans of the South, and if in his judgment he\r\nthought it necessary, to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus._\r\nThis measure, which had a considerable majority in the Senate,\r\nwas voted down in the House under the influence of Speaker\r\nBlaine, Mr. Dawes, General Farnsworth, and other prominent\r\nRepublicans.  During the controversy Mr. Blaine left the\r\nchair and engaged in the debate, being provoked by some thrust\r\nof Butler's.  There was a lively passage at arms, in which\r\nBlaine said he was obliged to leave the chair, as his predecessor\r\nMr. Colfax had been compelled to do, \"to chastise the insolence\r\nof the gentleman from Massachusetts.\"  Butler replied by some\r\ncharge against Blaine, to which Blaine, as he was walking\r\nback to take the gavel again, shouted out:  \"It's a calumny.\"\r\nMy sympathies in the matter, so far as the measure of legislation\r\nwas concerned, were with Butler, though I had, as is well\r\nknown, little sympathy with him in general.\r\n\r\nThe House undertook to adjourn the session, but the Senate\r\nrefused to do so without action on the bill for the protection\r\nof human rights at the South.  While things were in this condition,\r\nI was summoned one morning into the President's room at the\r\nCapitol, where I found President Grant, his Cabinet, several\r\nof the leading Senators, including Mr. Conkling, I think\r\nMr. Edmunds, Mr. Howe of Wisconsin, and I believe General\r\nWilson, Judge Shellabarger of Ohio, and one or two other members\r\nof the House.  All the persons who were there were favorable\r\nto the proposed legislation, I believe.  President Grant said\r\nthat he had been asked to send in a message urging Congress\r\nto pass a law giving him larger powers for the suppression\r\nof violence at the South; but he had sent for us to explain\r\nthe reason why he was unwilling to do it.  He thought that\r\nthe country would look with great disapprobation upon a request\r\nto enlarge the powers of the President, and especially to\r\nsuspend the writ of _habeas corpus_ in time of peace, and that he\r\nfelt especially unwilling to subject himself to that criticism\r\nas he had not come to that office from civil life, but had been\r\na soldier, and it might be supposed he favored military methods\r\nof government.  Several of the gentlemen present expressed\r\nrather guardedly their dissent from this view, but Grant seemed\r\nto remain firm.  I kept silent, as became a person young in\r\npublic life, until Mr. Howe and Judge Shellabarger whispered\r\ntogether, and then came to me and said: \"Mr. Hoar, you may\r\nperhaps, be able to have some influence on him.  Won't you\r\nsay something?\"  I then made a little speech to the President,\r\nin which I said that there was no question of the existence\r\nof these disorders and crimes; that they would be likely to\r\nbe increased, and not diminished, especially as the elections\r\nin the Southern States approached.  He could not allow them\r\nto continue.  He would be compelled, in my judgment, to interpose\r\nand go to the verge of his authority, or to leave to their\r\nfate those people whom we were bound by every consideration\r\nof honor to protect.  I asked him if he did not think it\r\nwould be better, instead of exercising a doubtful authority\r\nof his own, acquired without legislative sanction, to obtain\r\nthe necessary authority from Congress in advance.  I thought\r\nit much less likely to be imputed to him that he was acting\r\nin the manner of a soldier and not of a statesman if he were\r\ncareful to ask in advance the direction of the law-making\r\npower, and the people understood he was unwilling, even if\r\nhe had the authority, to act without the sanction of Congress.\r\nThis view produced an instant change of mind.  Grant took\r\na pen, wrote a brief message with great rapidity, read it\r\naloud to the persons who were assembled, and sent it in that\r\nvery day without the change of a word.  It is a clear and\r\nexcellent statement.  The result was that the Republican opposition\r\nto the measure in the House was withdrawn, the two Houses\r\ncame to an agreement, and adjourned without day soon afterward.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important acts of President Grant's Administration\r\nwas his veto of the Inflation Bill, which provided for a considerable\r\nincrease of the large volume of legal tender paper money,\r\nwhich at that time was not redeemed by the government.  This\r\nveto is regarded by most persons as the turning of the corner\r\nby the American people, and setting the face of the Government\r\ntoward specie payment and honest money.  It was during the\r\nhard times that followed the crisis of 1873.  It is said that\r\nPresident Grant had made up his mind to sign the bill, and\r\nsat down to write out his reasons, but that he found them\r\nso unsatisfactory that he changed his mind and sent in his\r\nveto message.  I had not been disposed to believe this until\r\nI was told, a little while ago, by Secretary Boutwell that\r\nhe had the statement that that was the fact from the lips\r\nof Grant himself.  If that be true, the President must have\r\nchanged his mind twice.  When the bill was pending in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, my wife's father, a very simple-\r\nhearted and excellent merchant of Worcester, who spent seventy\r\nyears of life in business on the same spot, visited us in\r\nWashington.  I took him up to see Grant.  The General was\r\nalone and, contrary to his usual custom, in a very talkative\r\nmood.  He seemed to like Mr. Miller, who had a huge respect\r\nfor him, and evidently saw that we were not there for any\r\noffice-seeking or other personal end.  He talked with great\r\nfreedom about himself and his visit to Worcester.  He expressed\r\nhis wonder that the town had grown and prospered so without\r\nany advantage of river or harbor or water power, or the neighborhood\r\nof rich mines or rich wheat-fields.  He then asked me how\r\nthe bill for an increased issue of green-backs was coming\r\non in the House.  I told him it seemed likely to pass.  He\r\nthen went on to express very earnestly his objection to the\r\nmeasure and to the whole policy, and his dislike of irredeemable\r\npaper.  He said that it was an immense injury to all classes\r\nof the people, but that it bore heavily upon poor and ignorant\r\nmen.  He said that speculators and bankers and brokers could\r\nforesee the changes which came about from the fluctuations\r\nof paper money and protect themselves from them, but the workingmen\r\nand poor men had no such advantages--that they were the greatest\r\nsufferers.  He added a suggestion I never heard before, that\r\nthere was in many parts of the country great loss from the\r\ncounterfeiting of paper money--a loss which fell almost wholly\r\nupon poor and ignorant men.  I never in my life heard Grant\r\ntalk so freely on any occasion.  I never in my life, but once,\r\nsaw him apparently so deeply moved.  I said: \"Mr. President,\r\nyou know the story of old Judge Grier and the Pennsylvania\r\njury.\"  \"No,\" said he.  \"Well,\" said I, \"there was once a\r\njury in Pennsylvania, when Grier was holding court, who brought\r\nin a very unjust verdict.  The judge said: 'Mr. Clerk, record\r\nthat verdict and enter under it, \"Set aside.\" I will have\r\nyou to know, Gentlemen of the Jury, that it takes thirteen\r\nmen in this court to steal a man's farm.' It takes three powers,\r\nMr. President, under our government to pass a law.\" Grant\r\nlaughed and said:  \"Well, if you send it up to me, make it\r\njust as bad as you can.\"  There can be no possible question\r\nthat he then desired and meant to veto the bill.  His desire\r\nthat it might be as bad as possible was that it might be more\r\neasy to defend his action.\r\n\r\nI had another exceedingly interesting conversation with the\r\nPresident on my return from New Orleans.  In the winter of\r\n1875 I went to New Orleans, as Chairman of a Committee of\r\nthe House of Representatives, to investigate and to ascertain\r\nwhich of the rival State governments had the true title.  Louisiana\r\nwas in a terrible condition.  Sheridan was in command of the\r\nUnited States troops there, and it was only their presence\r\nthat prevented an armed and bloody revolution.  The old rebel\r\nelement, as it was, had committed crimes against the freedmen\r\nand the white Republicans which make one of the foulest and\r\nbloodiest chapters in all history.  Sheridan had much offended\r\nthe white people there by his vigorous enforcement of laws,\r\nand especially by a letter in which he had spoken of them\r\nas banditti.  I stopped, during my stay in New Orleans, at\r\nthe St. Charles Hotel, where Sheridan also was a guest.  When\r\nhe came into the crowded breakfast-room every morning, there\r\nwere loud hisses and groans from nearly the whole assembled\r\ncompany.  The morning papers teemed with abusive articles.\r\nThe guests would take these papers, underscore some specially\r\nsavage attack, and tell the waiter to take it to General Sheridan\r\nas he sat at table at his breakfast.  The General would glance\r\nat it with an unruffled face, and bow and smile toward the\r\nsender of the article.  The whole thing made little impression\r\non him.  No violence toward him personally was ventured upon.\r\nThe night before I started on my return to Washington, General\r\nSheridan called to take leave.  I was much amused by the simplicity\r\nand _naivete_ with which he discussed the situation.  He\r\nsaid, among other things:  \"What you want to do, Mr. Hoar,\r\nwhen you get back to Washington, is to suspend the what-\r\ndo-you-call-it.\"  He meant, of course, the _habeas corpus._\r\nHe knew there was some very uncomfortable thing which stood\r\nin his way of promptly suppressing the crimes in Louisiana,\r\nwhere he said more men had been murdered for their political\r\nopinions than were slain in the Mexican War.  When I got back\r\nto Washington, the President sent for me and Mr. Frye of\r\nMaine, a member of the committee, to come to the President's\r\nroom in the Capitol to report to him the result of our observations.\r\nDuring the conversation, Grant expressed what he had often\r\nexpressed on other occasions, his great admiration for Sheridan.\r\nHe said:  \"I believe General Sheridan has no superior as a\r\ngeneral, either living or dead, and perhaps not an equal.\r\nPeople think he is only capable of leading an army in battle,\r\nor to do a particular thing he is told to do.  But I mean,\r\nall the qualities of a commander which enable him to direct\r\nover as large a territory as any two nations can cover in\r\nwar.  He has judgment, prudence, foresight, and power to deal\r\nwith the dispositions needed in a great war.  I entertained\r\nthis opinion of him before he became generally known in the\r\nlate war.\" I was so impressed with this generous tribute of\r\none great soldier to another that, as soon as the interview\r\nwas over, I wrote it down and asked Mr. Frye to join with\r\nme in certifying to its correctness.  It is now before me,\r\nand has the following certificate: \"The foregoing is a correct\r\nstatement of what General Grant said to me and Mr. Frye in\r\na conversation this morning in the President's room.  February\r\n15, 1875.  George F. Hoar.\"  \"I heard the above conversation,\r\nand certify to the correctness of the above statement of it.\r\nWilliam P. Frye.\"\r\n\r\nI heard General Grant express a like opinion of Sheridan\r\nunder circumstances perhaps even more impressive.  I was a\r\nguest at a brilliant dinner-party given by Mr. Robeson, Secretary\r\nof the Navy, where Grant, General Sherman, General Sheridan,\r\nCommodore Alden, Admiral Porter, Chief Justice Chase, Attorney-\r\nGeneral E. R. Hoar, Lyman Trumbull, Mr. Blaine, and some\r\nother men of great distinction were present.  There were about\r\ntwenty guests.  Mr. James Russell Lowell was of the company.\r\nI believe no one of that brilliant circle is now living.  Commodore\r\nAlden remarked, half in jest, to a gentleman who sat near\r\nhim, that there was nothing he disliked more than a subordinate\r\nwho always obeyed orders.  \"What is that you are saying, Commodore?\"\r\nsaid President Grant, across the table.  The Commodore repeated\r\nwhat he had said.  \"There is a good deal of truth in what\r\nyou say,\" said General Grant.  \"One of the virtues of General\r\nSheridan was that he knew when to act without orders.  Just\r\nbefore the surrender of Lee, General Sheridan captured some\r\ndespatches from which he learned that Lee had ordered his\r\nsupplies to a certain place.  I was on the other side of the\r\nriver, where he could get no communication from me until the\r\nnext morning.  General Sheridan pushed on at once without\r\norders, got to the place fifteen minutes before the rebels,\r\nand captured the supplies.  After the surrender was concluded,\r\nthe first thing General Lee asked me for was rations for his\r\nmen.  I issued to them the same provisions which Sheridan\r\nhad captured.  Now if Sheridan, as most men would have done,\r\nhad waited for orders from me, Lee would have got off.\" I\r\nlistened with wonder at the generous modesty which, before\r\nthat brilliant company, could remove one of the brightest\r\nlaurels from his own brow and place it on the brow of Sheridan.\r\n\r\nI had another memorable conversation with Grant, not so pleasant.\r\nIt revealed a capacity of intense passion which I do not know\r\nthat he ever manifested on any other occasion.  He had sent\r\ninto the Senate the nomination of William A. Simmons for\r\nthe important office of Collector of Boston.  This was due\r\nto the influence of General Butler.  Mr. Sumner, whose controversy\r\nwith the President is well known, was then the senior Senator\r\nfrom Massachusetts.  The nomination had been made, of course,\r\nwithout consulting him, with whom Grant was not on friendly\r\nterms, and without consulting any of the members of the House\r\nof Representatives except Butler.  There was a very earnest\r\nopposition to this nomination.  I went up to the White House\r\nto endeavor to induce President Grant to withdraw it, but\r\nhe had gone out.  I repeated my visit once or twice, but failed\r\nto find the President.  The third or fourth time that I went\r\nup, as I was coming away I saw President Grant on the other\r\nside of Pennsylvania Avenue, walking alone on the sidewalk\r\nadjoining Lafayette Square.  I suppose it was not in accordance\r\nwith etiquette to join the President when he was walking alone\r\nin the street; but I overtook him, and said: \"Mr. President,\r\nI have been to the White House several times, and been unable\r\nto find you in.  The business of the House is very urgent\r\njust now, and it is difficult for me to get away again.  Perhaps,\r\ntherefore, you will kindly allow me to say what I have to\r\nsay here.\"  The President very courteously assented.  I walked\r\nalong with him, turned the corner, and walked along the sidewalk\r\nadjoining the east side of Lafayette Square, until we came\r\nto the corner opposite the house then occupied by Sumner,\r\nwhich is now part of the Arlington Hotel.  I told the President\r\nthat I thought the Republicans of Massachusetts would be much\r\ndissatisfied with the nomination of Simmons, and hoped it\r\nmight be withdrawn.  The President replied that he thought\r\nit would be an injustice to the young man to do so, and that\r\nthe opposition to him seemed to be chiefly because he was\r\na friend of General Butler.  I combated the argument as well\r\nas I could.  The whole conversation was exceedingly quiet\r\nand friendly on both sides until we turned the corner by Mr.\r\nSumner's house, when the President, with great emphasis, and\r\nshaking his closed fist toward Sumner's house, said: \"I shall\r\nnot withdraw the nomination.  That man who lives up there\r\nhas abused me in a way which I never suffered from any other\r\nman living.\"  I did not, of course, press the President further.\r\nBut I told him I regretted very much the misunderstanding\r\nbetween him and Mr. Sumner, and took my leave.  It was evident\r\nthat in some way the President connected this nomination with\r\nthe controversy between himself and Sumner.\r\n\r\nI have always lamented, in common with all the friends and\r\nlovers of both these great men, that they should have so misunderstood\r\neach other; yet it was not unnatural.  They were both honest,\r\nfearless, patriotic, and brave.  Yet never were two honest,\r\nfearless, patriotic, and brave men more unlike each other.\r\nThe training, the mental characteristics, the field of service,\r\nthe capacities, the virtues, the foibles of each tended to\r\nmake him underestimate and misunderstand the other.  The man\r\nof war, and the man of peace; the man whose duty it was to\r\nwin battles and conduct campaigns, and the man who trusted\r\nto the prevalence of ideas in a remote future; the man who\r\nwielded executive power, and the man who in a fierce contest\r\nwith executive power had sought to extend the privileges,\r\npower, and authority of the Senate; the man who adhered tenaciously\r\nto his friends though good and evil report, and the man whose\r\nfriendships were such that evil report of personal dishonor\r\nnever dared assail them; the man of little taste for letters,\r\nand the man of vast and varied learning; the man of blunt,\r\nplain ways, and the man of courtly manners; the man of few\r\nwords, and the man who ever deemed himself sitting in a lofty\r\npulpit with a mighty sounding board, with a whole widespread\r\npeople for a congregation--how could they understand each\r\nother?  Grant cared little for speech-making.  It sometimes\r\nseemed as if Sumner thought the Rebellion itself was put down\r\nby speeches in the Senate, and that the war was an unfortunate\r\nand most annoying, though trifling disturbance, as if a fire-\r\nengine had passed by.  Sumner did injustice to Grant; Grant\r\ndid injustice to Sumner.  The judgment of each was warped\r\nand clouded, until each looked with a blood-shotten eye at\r\nthe conduct of the other.  But I believe they know and honor\r\neach other now.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nSUMNER AND WILSON\r\n\r\nWhen I took my seat on the 4th of March, 1869, the Commonwealth\r\nof Massachusetts had a position of power in both Houses of\r\nCongress never held by any other State before or since, unless\r\nwe except that held for a short time in early days by Virginia.\r\nCharles Sumner was beyond all question the foremost figure\r\non the National stage, save Grant alone.  He had seen the\r\ntriumph of the doctrines for which he had contended all his\r\nlife.  He had more than any other man contributed to fetter\r\nthe hands of Andrew Johnson and drive him from power.  Henry\r\nWilson was the most skilful political organizer in the country.\r\nSumner was at the head of the Committee on Foreign Relations,\r\nand Wilson of that of Military Affairs.  In the House Henry\r\nL. Dawes was at the head of the Committee on Appropriations,\r\nBenjamin F. Butler of the Committee on Reconstruction, William\r\nB. Washburn of the Committee on Claims, Nathaniel P. Banks\r\nof the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  These Committees with\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary of which General Butler was\r\na member, and the Committee on Ways and Means, controlled\r\nthe policy of the House on all the great questions then interesting\r\nthe country.  Samuel Hooper had the third place on the Committee\r\non Coinage, Weights and Measures.  But he was its dominant\r\nmember and in a later Congress introduced the Bill for Reforming\r\nthe Currency, a wise and salutary measure.  It is known,\r\nhowever, among ignorant people in some parts of the country\r\nas \"The Crime of '73.\"\r\n\r\nSumner and Wilson are so well known to the American people\r\nthat it would be superfluous for me to attempt to describe\r\neither elaborately.  I have spoken of each at some length\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner held a place in the public life of the country\r\nwhich no other man ever shared with him.  He held a place\r\nin the public life of the world shared by very few indeed.\r\nHe was an idealist.  He subjected every measure to the inexorable\r\ntest of the moral law.  Yet, at the same time, he was a powerful\r\npolitical leader, and in a time when the fate of the Republic\r\nwas decided accomplished vast practical results.  Where duty\r\nseemed to him to utter its high commands he could see no obstacle\r\nin hostile majorities, and no restraint in the limitations\r\nof a written Constitution.  It is right, therefore Constitutional,\r\nwas the logical formula with which he dealt with every question\r\nof State.  We should be deaf and blind to all the lessons\r\nof history, if we were to declare it to be safe that men\r\ntrusted with Executive or even with Legislative power should\r\nact on that principle.  Unfortunately, humanity is so constituted\r\nthat the benevolent despot is likely to work more mischief\r\neven than a malevolent despot.  His example of absolute disregard\r\nof constitutional restraints will be followed by men of very\r\ndifferent motives.  Yet the influence of one such man pressing\r\nand urging his companions forward in a Legislative body like\r\nthe Senate of the United States, keeping ever before the people\r\nthe highest ideals, inspired by the love of liberty, and ever\r\nspeaking and working in the fear of God, is inestimable.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner lacked that quality which enables the practical\r\nstatesman to adjust the mechanism of complicated statutes.\r\nHe had no genius for detail.  It would not have been safe\r\nto trust him with Appropriation Bills, or Bills for raising\r\nrevenue.  But he was competent to deal with questions of the\r\ngreatest moment to the State.  He knew what are its governing\r\nforces.  He retained his hold on those forces.  He directed\r\nthem.  He caused sound principles of action to take effect\r\nin the Government of the State in great emergencies.  He converted\r\nthe people to his opinion.  He inspired the people with lofty\r\ndesires.  He accomplished wise public ends by wise means.\r\nHe maintained his hold on power in an important time.  He\r\ntook a prominent part in great debates and was the acknowledged\r\nleader of one side of the question.  He believed that the\r\nconscience of the people was a better guide than individual\r\nambitions.  He always did the thing he could best do.  He\r\ndid the thing that most needed to be done, the thing most\r\neffective at the time, the thing that no other man did or\r\ncould do.  He left to others to do what hundreds of others\r\ncould do well enough.  He contributed largely to the Government\r\nof his country, in the most trying period of our history,\r\nits motive and its direction.  That is a pretty practical\r\ncontribution to the voyage which furnishes to the steamship\r\nits engine and its compass.  His figure will abide in history\r\nlike that of St. Michael in art, an emblem of celestial purity,\r\nof celestial zeal, of celestial courage.  It will go down\r\nto immortality with its foot upon the dragon of Slavery, and\r\nwith the sword of the spirit in its hand, but with a tender\r\nlight in its eye, and a human love in its smile.  Guido and\r\nRaphael conceived their \"inviolable saint,\"\r\n\r\n  Invulnerable, impenetrably armed:\r\n  Such high advantages his innocence\r\n  Gave him above his foe; not to have sinned,\r\n  Not to have disobeyed.  In fight he stood\r\n  Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained\r\n  By wounds.\r\n\r\nThe Michael of the painters, as a critic of genius akin to\r\ntheir own has pointed out, rests upon his prostrate foe light\r\nas a morning cloud, no muscle strained, with unhacked sword\r\nand unruffled wings, his bright tunic and shining armor without\r\na rent or stain.  Not so with our human champion.  He had\r\nto bear the bitterness and agony of a long and doubtful struggle,\r\nwith common weapons and against terrible odds.  He came out\r\nof it with soiled garments and with a mortal wound, but without\r\na regret and without a memory of hate.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Sumner and fortunate for the Commonwealth\r\nand the country that he had Henry Wilson for his colleague.\r\nWilson supplied almost everything that Sumner lacked.  I cannot\r\nundertake to tell the story of his useful life in the space\r\nat my command here.  If I were to try I should do great injustice\r\nto him and to myself.\r\n\r\nHe was a very impressive and interesting character, of many\r\nvirtues, of many faults.  His faults he would have been the\r\nfirst to acknowledge himself.  Indeed, I do not know of any\r\nfault he had that he would not have acknowledged and lamented\r\nin a talk with his near friend, or that he would have sought\r\nto hide from the people.\r\n\r\nThe motives which controlled his life from the time when\r\nhe snatched such moments as he could from this day's work\r\non a shoemaker's bench and studied far into the night to\r\nfit himself for citizenship, down to the time when he died\r\nin the Vice-President's chamber--the second officer in the\r\nGovernment--and if his life and health had been spared, he\r\nvery likely would have been called to the highest place in\r\nthe Government--were public and patriotic, not personal.\r\nHe was not without ambitions for himself.  But they were\r\nalways subordinate in him to the love of liberty and the\r\nlove of country.  He espoused the unpopular side when he\r\nstarted in life, and he stuck to it through all its unpopularity.\r\n\r\nHe was a skilful, adroit, practised and constant political\r\nmanager.  He knew the value of party organization, and did\r\nnot disdain the arts and diplomacies of a partisan.  He carried\r\nthem sometimes farther, in my judgment, than a scrupulous\r\nsense of honor would warrant, or than was consistent with\r\nthe noble, frank, lofty behavior which Massachusetts and the\r\nAmerican people expect of their statesmen.  The most conspicuous\r\ninstance of this was his joining the Know Nothing Party, in\r\nwhose intolerance he had no belief.\r\n\r\nBut it was done as an instrument for destroying the existing\r\npolitical parties, which were an obstacle to freedom, and\r\nclearing the field for a new one.  This object was successfully\r\naccomplished, and in its accomplishment Wilson had a large\r\nshare.  But it was, in my judgment, doing evil that good may\r\ncome.  Wilson freely admitted this before he died, and said--\r\nI have no doubt with absolute sincerity--that he would give\r\nten years of his life if he could blot out that one transaction.\r\n\r\nHe was a very valuable legislator.  He was the author of many\r\nimportant measures in the war, during which he was chairman\r\nof the Committee on Military Affairs of the Senate, and showed\r\nmuch ability in the way of practical and constructive statesmanship.\r\nI do not believe any man in the Senate in his time, not even\r\nSumner, had more influence over his colleagues than he.\r\n\r\nThere was not a drop of bigotry, intolerance, or personal\r\nhatred in him.  As you would expect from a man who raised\r\nhimself from the humblest to the loftiest place in the republic,\r\nhe was a believer in pure manhood, without respect of persons\r\nor conditions.\r\n\r\nHe was a powerful stump orator.  He never made speeches that\r\nwere quoted as models of eloquence or wisdom.  But he knew\r\nwhat the farmer and the mechanic and the workman at his bench\r\nwere thinking of, and addressed himself always to their best\r\nand highest thought.  He was a great vote-making speaker.\r\nWhen Mechanics Hall, in Worcester, or the City Hall was filled\r\nto hear Henry Wilson in a close campaign, many men who entered\r\nthe hall undecided or against him, went away to take earnest\r\npart on his side.\r\n\r\nHe had a good many angry political strifes.  But he never\r\nbore malice or seemed to keep angry over night.  General Butler\r\nonce wrote him a letter pouring out on his head the invective\r\nof which he was so conspicuous a master.  Wilson brought the\r\nletter into the office of a dear friend of mine in Boston\r\nwhen I happened to be there, handed it to us to read, and\r\nobserved:  \"That is a cussed mean letter.\" I do not think\r\nhe ever spoke of it or scarcely thought of it again.\r\n\r\nBut his chief gift and faculty is one which I can hardly\r\nthink of words to describe fitly.  The few of his old friends\r\nwho are left will understand what I mean.  But I can hardly\r\nmake those who did not know him, or live in his time, comprehend\r\nit.  That was his rare and unequalled gift of gathering and\r\nuttering the sentiment of the people.  When new and doubtful\r\nmatters of pith and moment were to be dealt with, and after\r\na long apparent hesitation, and backing and filling, and what\r\npeople who did not know him thought trembling in the balance,\r\nhe would at last make up his mind, determine on his action,\r\nand strike a blow which had in it not only the vigor of his\r\nown arm, but the whole vigor and strength of the public sentiment\r\nwhich he had gathered and which he represented.  He was an\r\nubiquitous person.  He would travel all over the State, spending\r\nthe day, perhaps, in visiting forty shops and factories in\r\nthe neighborhood of Boston; then take a nine or ten o'clock\r\ntrain at night and go up to Springfield, get in there at two\r\nor three o'clock in the morning, call up out of bed some active\r\npolitician and tell him he had come to sleep with him; spend\r\nthe night in talking over the matter about which he was anxious\r\nuntil six or seven o'clock in the morning (I do not believe\r\nhe ever slept much, either with anybody or alone), and then,\r\nperhaps, up to Northampton or Greenfield to see some person\r\nwhom he called Tom, Dick, or Harry, but who knew the local\r\nfeeling there; and after a week or two spent in that way,\r\nnever giving his own opinion, talking as if he were all things\r\nto all men, seeming to hesitate and hesitate and falter and\r\nbe frightened, so if you had met him and talked with him you\r\nwould have said, if you did not know him well, that there\r\nwas no more thought, nor more steadiness of purpose, or backbone\r\nin him than in an easterly cloud; but at length, when the\r\ntime came, and he had got ready, the easterly cloud seemed\r\nsuddenly to have been charged with an electric fire and a\r\nswift and resistless bolt flashed out, and the righteous\r\njudgment of Massachusetts came from his lips.\r\n\r\nWith all his faults, Peace be to the ashes of Henry Wilson.\r\nHe was a leader and a tribune of the people.  We do not seem\r\nto have such leaders now-a-days.  I liked Charles Sumner better.\r\nBut it was a great thing for Massachusetts, a great thing for\r\nhuman liberty, and a great thing for Charles Sumner himself\r\nthat he had Henry Wilson as a friend and ally, a disciple\r\nand a co-worker.\r\n\r\nIf Wilson had lived, in my opinion, it is quite likely that\r\nhe would have been the Republican candidate for the Presidency\r\nin 1876, and would have been triumphantly elected.  There\r\nwas a very powerful movement going on all over the country\r\nto bring that about.  Wilson's hold upon the affection of\r\nthe people everywhere was very strong indeed.\r\n\r\nWilson became Vice-President of the United States, March 4,\r\n1873.  He died two years afterward.  I was asked to write\r\nthe inscription for a tablet placed in the Vice-President's\r\nRoom in the Capitol by order of the Senate in 1902.  It follows\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIN THIS ROOM\r\nHENRY WILSON\r\nVICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nDIED NOVEMBER 22 1875.\r\nTHE SON OF A FARM LABORER, NEVER AT\r\nSCHOOL MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS, IN\r\nYOUTH A JOURNEYMAN SHOEMAKER, HE\r\nRAISED HIMSELF TO THE HIGH PLACES OF\r\nFAME, HONOR AND POWER, AND BY UNWEARIED\r\nSTUDY MADE HIMSELF AN AUTHORITY IN THE\r\nHISTORY OF HIS COUNTRY AND OF LIBERTY,\r\nAND AN ELOQUENT PUBLIC SPEAKER TO\r\nWHOM SENATE AND PEOPLE EAGERLY\r\nLISTENED.  HE DEALT WITH AND CONTROLLED\r\nVAST PUBLIC EXPENDITURE DURING A GREAT\r\nCIVIL WAR, YET LIVED AND DIED POOR, AND\r\nLEFT TO HIS GRATEFUL COUNTRYMEN THE\r\nMEMORY OF AN HONORABLE PUBLIC SERVICE,\r\nAND A GOOD NAME FAR BETTER THAN RICHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nPERSONALITIES IN DEBATE\r\n\r\nI have been, in general, enabled to avoid angry conflicts\r\nin debate or the exchange of rough personalities.  My few\r\nexperiences of that kind came from attacks on Massachusetts,\r\nwhich I could not well avoid resenting.  The only two I now\r\nthink of happened in my first term.  In one case, Mr. S.\r\nS. Cox of New York, who was one of the principal champions\r\non the Democratic side of the House, a man noted for his wit,\r\nundertook to make an attack on the Massachusetts Puritans,\r\nand to revive the old slander that they had burned witches.\r\nI made some slight correction of what Mr. Cox had said but\r\nhe renewed the attack.  I was then comparatively unknown in\r\nthe House.  Mr. Cox treated me with considerable contempt,\r\nand pointing to Mr. Dawes, who had charge of the bill then\r\nunder discussion, but who had not given any reply to Cox's\r\nattack, said, with a contemptuous look at me: \"Massachusetts\r\ndoes not send her Hector to the field,\" to which I answered\r\nthat it was not necessary to send Hector to the field when\r\nthe attack was led by Thersites.  The retort seemed to strike\r\nthe House favorably, and was printed in the papers throughout\r\nthe country, and Cox let me and Massachusetts alone thereafter.\r\n\r\nI had a like encounter with Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana,\r\nwho was a more formidable competitor.  Mr. Voorhees made the\r\nsame charge against the people of Massachusetts of having\r\nburned witches at the stake in the old Puritan time.  It was\r\nin a debate under the five-minute rule.  After reiterating\r\nthe old familiar slander that the State of Massachusetts in\r\nher early history had burned witches at the stake, Mr. Voorhees\r\nadded that in 1854 or 1855 the Know Nothings broke up convents,\r\nburned Catholic churches, and would have burned Catholics\r\nand Sisters of Charity themselves at the stake within her\r\nborders, if they had dared to do so.\r\n\r\nI declared both of these charges to be utterly false, and\r\nsaid that no human being was ever burned at the stake in\r\nMassachusetts for the crime of witchcraft, and though at a\r\ntime when the whole civilized world believed in witchcraft\r\non the authority of certain passages in the Old Testament,\r\nthe courts of Massachusetts did execute some nineteen or\r\ntwenty persons of both sexes for the alleged crime of witchcraft,\r\nit was also true that the people of Massachusetts were the\r\nfirst among men to see the error and wickedness of this course;\r\nthat although late in the following century, many people were\r\ncondemned for witchcraft in England and on the Continent,\r\nthe love of justice and the intelligence of Massachusetts\r\nfirst exposed that error and wickedness.\r\n\r\nI explained that a convent was burned in Massachusetts, not\r\nin 1854 or 1855 by the Know Nothings, but in 1836, by a mob\r\nexcited by a rumor that some terrible cruelty had been inflicted\r\nupon some young women who had been placed in a convent at\r\nCharlestown; that the criminals were arrested, tried and sentenced,\r\nand that their crime left no more stain upon the State than\r\nany criminal act committed within the limits of any civilized\r\ncountry.  In conclusion, I said it did not become the political\r\nfriends of the men who had burned our soldiers alive at Fort\r\nPillow, or who burned orphan asylums in New York, and hung\r\nnegroes on lamp posts, to talk of cruelties in a past age.\r\n\r\nThis retort angered Voorhees beyond endurance, and before\r\nI could finish my sentence, he sprang to his feet and cried\r\nout in great anger:  \"Every word the gentleman says is false\r\nand he knows it.\"  There was a demand that my words be taken\r\ndown and that the words of Mr. Voorhees be taken down.  That\r\nwas done.  The chairman of the committee, Mr. Ingersoll,\r\nbrother of the famous Robert G. Ingersoll, declared that\r\nthe words of Mr. Voorhees were unparliamentary, and ruled\r\nthat my language was \"rather pungent but not unparliamentary.\"\r\nWhereupon the committee arose amid great laughter, and the\r\ntransaction ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nTHE NATIONAL HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN 1869\r\n\r\nThe House, when I entered it, contained many very able men.\r\nSome of them remained long enough in public life to fill a\r\nlarge and prominent place in the history of the country.  Others\r\nretired early.  I will mention only a few.\r\n\r\nI do not think his countrymen have estimated Nathaniel P.\r\nBanks at his true value.  When he left office at the ripe\r\nage of seventy-five a public service ended surpassed in variety\r\nand usefulness by that of few citizens of Massachusetts since\r\nthe days of John Adams.  He bore a great part in a great history.\r\nMen who saw him in his later life, a feeble, kindly old man,\r\nwith only the remains of his stately courtesy, had little\r\nconception of the figure of manly strength and dignity which\r\nhe presented when he presided over the Constitutional Convention\r\nin 1853, or took the oath of office as Governor in 1858.  He\r\nraised himself from a humble place, unaided, under the stimulant\r\nof a native and eager desire for excellence.  He was always\r\nregarded by the working people of Massachusetts as the type\r\nof what was best in themselves and as the example and representative\r\nof the great opportunity which the Republic holds out to its\r\npoorest citizens and their children.  He was a natural gentleman,\r\nalways kindly and true.  From this trait and not because of\r\na want of fidelity to his own convictions he found as warm\r\nfriends among his political opponents as among his political\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nGen. Banks was Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations\r\nin 1869.  He was then beginning to lose somewhat his oratorical\r\npower and the splendid qualities which made him so important\r\na force in the history of Massachusetts and of the country.\r\nBut still on fit occasions he showed all his old vigor and\r\nbrilliancy.  When the delegation gave a dinner to William\r\nB. Washburn on his election as Governor Banks presided.  He\r\nkept up a running stream of eloquence and wit as he introduced\r\nthe different speakers and punctuated their remarks with interjections\r\nof his own, which I have never known equalled, though I have\r\nattended many like occasions.  Banks was a man of humble origin.\r\nHe used to be known as the Waltham Bobbin Boy.  He worked\r\nin his boyhood and youth in a factory in Waltham.  He had\r\nvery early a passion for reading.  When Felton was inaugurated\r\nPresident of Harvard, Banks was Governor.  As is the custom,\r\nhe represented the Commonwealth and inducted the new President\r\ninto office.  There were famous speakers at the Dinner,--\r\nDaniel Webster, old Josiah Quincy, Edward Everett, Dr. Walker,\r\nWinthrop, and Felton himself.  But the Governor's speech was\r\nthe best of the whole.  He described the time of his poverty\r\nin his youth when he used to work in a mill five days in a\r\nweek, and on Saturday walk ten miles to Boston to spend the\r\nday in the Athenaeum Library and ten miles back at night.\r\nHe told how he used to peer in through the gate as he passed\r\nHarvard College with an infinite longing for the treasures\r\nof learning that were inside.  That refined and fastidious\r\naudience was stirred by an unwonted emotion.\r\n\r\nThe older public men of Massachusetts did not take very kindly\r\nto Banks.  He was a man of the people.  He was sometimes charged,\r\nthough unjustly, with being a demagogue.  He sometimes erred\r\nin his judgment.  But he was a man of large and comprehensive\r\nvision, of independence, and exerted his vast influence with\r\nthe people for high ends.  He might justly be called, like\r\nthe negro Toussaint, L'Ouverture,--The Opener.  His election\r\nas Governor extracted the people from the mire of Know Nothingism.\r\nHis election as Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives\r\nwas part of the first victory over the Whig Dynasty which\r\nhad kept the State, contrary to its best traditions, in alliance\r\nwith slavery.  His election as Speaker of the United States\r\nHouse of Representatives was the first National Republican\r\nvictory.  His taking a little slave girl on a cannon during\r\nthe War in his march through the Shenandoah Valley was hailed\r\nthroughout the country as an omen that the War would not end\r\nuntil slavery was abolished.  He rendered a special service\r\nto the Commonwealth and to the cause of good learning which\r\nI think never would have been accomplished without his personal\r\ninfluence.  When Agassiz had been in this country but a few\r\nyears he seriously contemplated going back to Europe.  It\r\nwas understood that he would stay if a sufficient fund could\r\nbe raised to enable him to prosecute his researches here and\r\nto establish a museum where his collections could be cared\r\nfor and made useful to science.  There was a meeting in Boston\r\nto see about raising the fund.  The Governor was invited to\r\nattend.  The gentlemen present spoke rather doubtfully of\r\nthe prospect of success.  Governor Banks was asked what he\r\nthought the Commonwealth would do.  He replied: \"The Commonwealth\r\nwill give a hundred thousand dollars.\" The Legislature had\r\nbeen of late years economical, not to say niggardly, in such\r\nmatters.  Governor Banks's declaration was received with entire\r\nincredulity.  One gentleman present said that he was very\r\nmuch discouraged by what His Excellency had said.  If he\r\nhad said some moderate sum there might have been hope that\r\nit would be given, but it was utterly hopeless to expect\r\nthat any such extravagant sum as that would be contributed\r\nby the State.  The gentleman seemed to be well warranted\r\nin what he said.  The three colleges, Harvard, Amherst and\r\nWilliams, had united in an application for one hundred thousand\r\ndollars shortly before.  It was supported by the eloquence\r\nof Edward Everett and the authority of Mark Hopkins and President\r\nHitchcock.  Harvard was then so poor that they had not money\r\nto spare when they wanted to move the pulpit from the end\r\nto the side of the Chapel.  But the application was denied.\r\nBanks relied in his somewhat sonorous fashion: \"You need not\r\ntrouble yourself, Sir.  The Commonwealth will give a hundred\r\nthousand dollars.\" And she did.  This was followed by the\r\ngrant, under Banks's influence, for the endowment of the Boston\r\nInstitute of Technology, large grants to the colleges and\r\ngrants to some of the endowed schools.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks's statue should stand by the State House as\r\none of the foremost benefactors of the great educational\r\ninstitutions of the Commonwealth, and as an example of what\r\na generous ambition can accomplish for the humblest child\r\nin the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Boutwell, who is still living, became a member of\r\nPresident Grant's Cabinet in March, 1869, and remained in\r\nthe House only a day or two of the spring session which lasted\r\nabout ten days.  He was succeeded in the following December\r\nby George M. Brooks, who had been my friend from early boyhood.\r\nHe would in my judgment have had an eminent political career\r\nif he had remained in public life, but for his great modesty.\r\nHe never seemed to value highly anything he accomplished himself.\r\nBut his sympathy and praise were always called out by anything\r\ndone by a friend.  I think Brooks took much more pleasure\r\nin anything well done or well said by one of his colleagues\r\nthan in anything of his own.  He was a man of an exceedingly\r\nsweet, gracious and affectionate nature, loving as a  child,\r\nyet as men of such natures often are, thoroughly manly.  He\r\nwas incapable of any meanness or conscious wrong-doing.  He\r\nhad a very pleasant and ready wit.  The people of Middlesex\r\nCounty, especially of Concord, were very fond of him, and\r\nwould have kept him in public life as long as he desired.\r\nBut his heath was not good in Washington.  The climate of\r\nthe place and the bad air of the House were unfavorable.  He\r\ndid not fancy very much the strife and noise of that turbulent\r\nassembly.  So he gladly accepted an appointment to the office\r\nof Judge of Probate of Middlesex County which was absolutely\r\nsuited to him.  He administered that important office to the\r\nentire satisfaction of the people until his death.  I think\r\nGeorge Brooks's smile would be enough to console any widow\r\nin an ordinary affliction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Barrett Washburn, afterward Governor and Senator,\r\nwas Chairman of the Committee on Claims.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the best recent examples of a character whose\r\nexternal manifestations change somewhat with changing manners\r\nand fashions, but the substance of whose quality abides and\r\nI believe will abide through many succeeding generations.\r\nHe was a New England Puritan.  He brought to the service of\r\nthe people a purity of heart, a perfect integrity, an austerity\r\nof virtue which not so much rendered him superior to all temptation\r\nas made it impossible to conceive that any of the objects\r\nof personal desire which lead public men astray could ever\r\nto him even be a temptation.\r\n\r\nThere were few stronger or clearer intellects in the public\r\nservice.  His mind moved rapidly by a very simple and direct\r\npath to a sound and correct result in the most difficult\r\nand complicated cases.  The Chairmanship of the Committee\r\non Claims was then with two or three exceptions the most\r\nimportant position in the House.  He spoke very seldom and\r\nthen to the point, stating very perfectly the judgment of\r\na clear-headed and sound business man.  But his opinion carried\r\ngreat weight.  He was universally respected.  Every man felt\r\nsafe in following his recommendation in any matter which he\r\nhad carefully investigated.\r\n\r\nCongress was beset by claims to the amount of hundreds and\r\nhundreds of millions, where fraud seemed sometimes to exhaust\r\nits resources, where, in the conflict of testimony, it was\r\nalmost impossible to determine the fact, and where the facts\r\nwhen determined often presented the most novel and difficult\r\nquestions of public law and public policy.  Mr. Washburn's\r\ndealing with these cases was the very sublimity of common\r\nsense.  He very soon acquired the confidence of the House\r\nso completely that his judgment became its law in matters\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of his committee.  I became acquainted\r\nwith him, an acquaintance which soon ripened into cordial\r\nfriendship, when I entered the House in the spring of 1869.\r\nI think I may fairly claim that it was the result of what\r\nI said and did that he was agreed upon by the opponents of\r\nGeneral Butler as their candidate for Governor, and was Butler's\r\nsuccessful antagonist.\r\n\r\nBeneath his plain courtesy was a firmness which Cato never\r\nsurpassed.  Upon a question of morality, or freedom or righteousness\r\nthere was never a drop of compromise in his blood.  He could\r\nnot be otherwise than the constant foe of slavery, and the\r\nconstant friend of everything which went to emancipate and\r\nelevate the slave.  It was his good fortune to record his\r\nvote in favor of all the three great amendments to the constitution,\r\nand to be the supporter, friend and trusted counsellor of\r\nAbraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAfter his election to fill Sumner's unexpired term I had a\r\nletter from Adin Thayer in which he said:  \"Washburn hates\r\nButler with an Evangelical hatred which you know is more intense\r\nthan a Liberal Christian can attain to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Buffington was a shrewd and amusing character.  He understood\r\nthe temper of the House very well and had great influence\r\nin accomplishing anything he undertook.  He prided himself\r\non the fact that he never missed answering to his name at\r\nroll call during his whole term of service.  He understood\r\nvery well the art of pleasing his constituents.  He made it\r\na rule, he told me, to send at least one document under his\r\nown frank every year to every voter in his District.  On one\r\noccasion in a hotly contested election he had four votes more\r\nin a town on Cape Cod than any other candidate.  He was curious\r\nand inquired what it meant.  The Chairman of the Selectmen\r\ntold him that there were four men who lived in an out-of-\r\nthe-way place, who never came to town meetings and nobody\r\nseemed to know much about them.  They were a father and his\r\nthree sons, living together on the same farm.  But at that\r\nelection they appeared at the town meeting.  All four voted\r\nfor Buffington and for no other candidate and disappeared\r\nat once.  The Selectman asked him why he voted for Buffington.\r\n\"If he knew him?\" \"No!\" said the old fellow.  \"He knows me.\r\nHe sends me and each of my sons a document every winter.\"\r\n\r\nBuffington was very anxious about the matter of patronage\r\nand of getting offices for all his constituents.  A great\r\nmany men applied for his support; frequently there were many\r\napplications for the same office.  He did not like to refuse\r\nthem.  So he made it a rule to give all of them a letter of\r\nrecommendation to the Departments.  But he had an understanding\r\nwith the appointing clerks that if he wrote his name Buffington\r\nwith the g he desired that man should be appointed, but if\r\nhe wrote it Buffinton without the g he did not wish to be\r\ntaken seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond all question the leader of the Massachusetts delegation,\r\nand of the House, was Henry L. Dawes.  He had had a successful\r\ncareer at the bar and in public life before his election to\r\nCongress.  In Congress he made his way to the front very rapidly.\r\nNo member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts\r\nand few from any part of the Union had an influence which\r\ncould be at all compared with his.  He became in succession\r\nChairman of the two foremost Committees, that of Appropriations\r\nand that of Ways and Means.  He was a prominent candidate\r\nfor the office of Speaker when Mr. Blaine was elected and\r\nwas defeated, as I have said elsewhere, only by the adroit\r\nmanagement of Butler.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes represented the Berkshire District in the House\r\nfor eighteen years when he declined further service there.\r\nHe was then elected to the Senate where he remained eighteen\r\nyears longer, when he declined further service there.  During\r\nthe last part of his last term he was troubled with a growing\r\ndeafness which I suppose had much to do with his declining\r\nto enter upon the contest for another reelection.  He was\r\nregarded by the manufacturers of Massachusetts as their faithful\r\nand powerful representative.  He had several contests for\r\nhis seat in the Senate when his opponents thought they were\r\nsure of success; but they found themselves left in the minority\r\nwhen the vote came to be taken.  They never fully comprehended\r\nwhat defeated them.  They would get the support of men who\r\nwere active in caucuses and nominating conventions and supposed\r\nwith excellent reason that they were safe.  But there was\r\nin every factory village in Massachusetts some man of influence\r\nand ability and wealth, frequently a large employer of labor,\r\nwho had been in the habit of depending on Mr. Dawes for the\r\nsecurity of his most important interests, so far as they could\r\nbe affected by legislation.  They knew him and they knew that\r\nhe knew them, and their power when they chose to exert it\r\ncould not be resisted.\r\n\r\nPersons who saw Mr. Dawes in his later years only, when he\r\nsat quietly in his seat in the Senate, taking little part save\r\nin a few special subjects, could not realize what a power he\r\nhad been when he was the leading and strongest champion in\r\nthat great body which contained Blaine and Bingham and Butler\r\nand Schenck and Farnsworth and Allison and Eugene Hale and\r\nGarfield.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Dawes left the Senate in 1893, his associates gave\r\na banquet in his honor, at which I made the following remarks.\r\nThey were, I believe, approved by the entire company.  I record\r\nthem here as my deliberate judgment:\r\n\r\n\"If there be any admirer of other forms of government who\r\nthink unfavorably of our republican fashion of selecting\r\nour rulers, I would invite him to examine the list of men\r\nwhom Massachusetts for a hundred years has chosen as her\r\nSenators of the first class.  I do not claim for her any\r\nsuperiority over other Commonwealths in this respect--but\r\ncertainly she has given you of her best.  She has sent men who\r\nwere worthy to be peers of the men who have represented her\r\nsister States, and if that be true, they surely have been\r\nworthy to be peers in any Senate that was ever gathered upon\r\nearth.  The line begins with Tristram Dalton, save Washington\r\nthe stateliest gentleman of his time, rich in every mental\r\naccomplishment, whose presence graced and ennobled every assembly\r\nthat he entered.  Next to him comes George Cabot, the wise\r\nstatesman and accomplished merchant, beloved friend of Hamilton,\r\ntrusted counsellor of Washington, whose name and lineage are\r\nrepresented at this table to-night, who shared with this successor,\r\nBenjamin Goodhue, the honor of being the first authority in\r\nfinance in their generation, save Hamilton alone.\r\n\r\n\"Then comes John Quincy Adams, who left the Senate, after\r\nyears of illustrious public service, in 1808, but to begin\r\nanother public service of forty years, still more illustrious.\r\nHe served his country in every department of public occupation.\r\nHe was Minister in five great Powers in succession.  He was\r\npresent as Secretary when the treaty of peace was signed in\r\n1783.  He negotiated and signed the Treaty of Ghent, the Commercial\r\nTreaty of 1815, the French Treaty of 1822, the Prussian Treaty,\r\nand the treaty which acquired Florida from Spain.  He was\r\nSenator, Representative, Foreign Minister, Secretary of State,\r\nand President.  He breasted the stormy waves of the House\r\nof Representatives at the age of eighty, and when he died\r\nin the Capitol, he left no purer or loftier fame behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Next came James Lloyd, the modest gentleman, the eloquent\r\norator and the accomplished man of business.  Then came Gore\r\nand Ashmun and Mellen and Mills, each great among the great\r\nlawyers of a great generation.  Next in the procession comes\r\nthe majestic presence of Daniel Webster, whose matchless logic\r\nand splendid eloquence gave to the Constitution of the country\r\nan authority in the reason and in the hearts of his countrymen\r\nequal to anything in judicial decision and equal to that of\r\nany victory of arms.  With his reply to Hayne, it has been\r\nsaid that every Union cannon in the late war was shotted.\r\nHis power in debate was only equalled by his wisdom in council.\r\nIt was said of him by one whose fame as a great public teacher\r\nequals his own: 'His weight was like the falling of a planet,\r\nhis discretion the return of its due and perfect curve.'\r\n\r\n\"Then comes Rufus Choate, next to Webster himself the foremost\r\nforensic orator of modern times, against whose imperial eloquence\r\nno human understanding, either on the Bench or in the jury\r\nbox, seemed to be proof.  Following them is he who still lives\r\nin his honored age, with his intellectual powers unshattered,\r\nthe foremost citizen of his native Commonwealth, the accomplished\r\nand eloquent Winthrop.  Next comes Rantoul, who died when\r\nhis foot had scarcely crossed the threshold of the Senate\r\nChamber, whose great hope was equal to the greatest of memories.\r\nNext is the figure of the apostle of liberty, Charles Sumner,\r\nthe echo of whose voice still seems to linger in the arches\r\nof the Capitol.  To those of us who remember him, he seems,\r\nas Disraeli said of Richard Cobden, 'still sitting, still\r\ndebating, still legislating' in the Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\n\"No two of these men were alike in the quality they brought\r\nto the public service.  Their mental portraiture is as different\r\nand as individual as the faces painted by Titian or Van Dyke\r\nor Holbein.  But each brought to the service of the State\r\nwhat she most needed in each generation.  The constructive\r\nstatesman, the framer of the Constitution and statutes, the\r\nfinancier, the debater, the lawyer, the man of business, the\r\ndiplomatist, the reformer, the orator, are all there, and\r\nall are there at their best.\r\n\r\n\"It is enough, and not too much, to say of my colleague that,\r\nas he lays down his office, the State that has been proud\r\nof them is proud of him.  The State that has been satisfied\r\nwith them is satisfied with him.  In all this illustrious\r\nline, there is none other who has more faithfully and more\r\nsuccessfully discharged every duty of Senatorial service,\r\nand who has more constantly represented the interests and\r\ncharacter of the dear old Commonwealth, who has maintained\r\na higher or firmer place in her confidence and respect than\r\nhe whom we greet and with whom we part to-night.  Mr. Dawes\r\nwas elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives\r\nin 1847.  Every year since, with one exception, he has held\r\nsome honorable public station from the gift of his native\r\nState.  Everywhere, at the Bar, in the State Legislature,\r\nin the Representative Chamber, in the Senate Chamber, he has\r\nbeen a leader.  Some great department of public service has\r\ndepended upon him for a successful administration.  He has\r\nalways been appointed to some special service or duty or difficulty\r\nwhich he has discharged to the entire satisfaction of his\r\nconstituents and his political associates.  His work has been\r\nas remarkable for its variety as for its dignity and importance,\r\nor the length of time for which it has continued.  He has\r\nproved himself fit for every conspicuous position in our\r\nRepublican army except that of trumpeter.  When the duty\r\nwas done, he has not sought for personal credit or popular\r\napplause.  His qualities have not been those for which the\r\npeople manifested their regard by shouting or clapping of\r\nhands, or stamping of feet in public meetings; he has had\r\nno following of ambitious politicians whom he has sought to\r\nrepay for their political services at the public expense.\r\n\r\n\"But he has had a place second to that of no other man in\r\nthe solid and enduring esteem of the people of the Commonwealth.\r\nHe has been content to do a service, and has left the other\r\nmen who sought for it the credit of doing it.  His official\r\naction has tended to make or unmake great industries.  Great\r\nfortunes have depended upon it.  He has affected values of\r\nmillions upon millions, and yet he retires from office with\r\nunstained hands, without fortune, and without a spot upon\r\nhis integrity.  He has no children pensioned at the public\r\ncharge.  He will leave behind him no wealth gained directly\r\nor indirectly from his public opportunities.  He will go back\r\nto a humble and simple dwelling not exceeding in costliness\r\nthat of many a Massachusetts merchant or farmer.  But honor,\r\ngood fame, the affection of his fellow citizens, the friendship\r\nof his fellow Senators will enter its portals with him, and\r\nthere they will dwell with him until he leaves it for his\r\nlast home.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes was a very powerful and logical reasoner.  He was\r\na very successful advocate when at the Bar and he was always\r\na strong antagonist in debate and very effective as a campaign\r\nspeaker.  He stuck closely to his subject.  He had a gift\r\nof sarcasm with which he could make an adversary feel exceedingly\r\nuncomfortable, although he rarely indulged in it.  He almost\r\nnever attempted eloquence, except so far as it is found in\r\nhis grave and effective statement of his case.  One sentence\r\nof his which I myself heard deserves to be remembered among\r\nthe best things in American eloquence.  Speaking to thirty\r\nor forty people at a club in Boston of the power and greatness\r\nof the Republic, he said: \"If we cannot say of our country,\r\nas Mr. Webster said of England, 'that her morning drum-beat\r\ncircles the earth with an unbroken strain of her martial airs,'\r\nwe can at least say that before the sun sets upon Alaska he\r\nhas risen upon Maine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my first Congress the leadership was shared between my\r\ncolleague, Mr. Dawes, and Robert C. Schenck of Ohio.  General\r\nSchenck was an old Whig.  He had served with distinction in\r\nthe time of Webster and Clay and Calhoun and Corwin.  He had\r\nthe gift of vigorous, simple Saxon English.  He was a very\r\npowerful debater, a man of wisdom and of industry.  He was\r\nChairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, and carried through\r\nto success, against odds and difficulties, an important tariff\r\nbill.  At one time he found the measure, which he had introduced,\r\noverloaded and destroyed by amendments.  He abandoned it in\r\ndisgust, declaring that it had been \"nibbled to death by\r\npismires.\"  But he afterward introduced the measure in another\r\nform, and came off successful and triumphant in the end.\r\n\r\nHe was afterward sent abroad by General Grant to succeed Mr.\r\nMotley.  He got into trouble there by giving a letter of recommendation\r\nwhich was unwisely used to promote an enterprise known as\r\nthe Emma Mine.  He gave the recommendation, I have no doubt,\r\nin entire good faith.  The stock of that mine went down.  The\r\ninvestors lost their money, and great complaint was made that\r\nhe had used his official position to promote a fraudulent\r\nscheme.  He was compelled to withdraw from the Mission.  He\r\nwas not recalled, but came home on leave of absence, and resigned\r\nhere.  So he was not obliged to take formal leave.  But the\r\nstock of the mine afterward became exceedingly valuable,\r\nand the public regretted the unjust judgment they had formed\r\nabout General Schenck.  I had and have a great regard for\r\nhim.  There was not a dishonest hair on the old fellow's head.\r\nHis health failed soon after, so he had no opportunity to\r\nrender further service, which would undoubtedly have caused\r\nthat unpleasant affair to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Luke P. Poland of Vermont was another very interesting\r\ncharacter.  He was well known throughout the country.  He\r\nhad a tall and erect and very dignified figure, and a fine\r\nhead covered with a beautiful growth of gray hair.  He was\r\ndressed in the old-fashioned style that Mr. Webster used,\r\nwith blue coat, brass buttons and a buff-colored vest.  His\r\ncoat and buttons were well known all over the country.  One\r\nday when William Lloyd Garrison was inveighing against some\r\nconduct of the Southern whites, and said: \"They say the South\r\nis quiet now.  Order reigns in Warsaw.  But where is Poland?\"\r\nAn irreverent newspaper man said: \"He is up in Vermont polishing\r\nbrass buttons.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge was a very able lawyer, and a man of very great\r\nindustry.  He and Judge Hoar went over together the revision\r\nof the United States statutes of 1874, completing a labor\r\nwhich had been neglected by Caleb Cushing.  Judge Poland had\r\na good deal of fun in him, and had a stock of anecdotes which\r\nhe liked to tell to any listener.  It was said, I do not know\r\nhow truly, that he could bear any amount of whiskey without\r\nin the slightest degree affecting his intellect.  There was\r\na story that two well-known Senators laid a plot to get the\r\nJudge tipsy.  They invited him to a room at Willards, and\r\nprivately instructed the waiter, when they ordered whiskey\r\nto put twice as much of the liquid into Poland's glass as\r\ninto the others.  The order was repeated several times.  The\r\nheads of the two hosts had begun to swim, but Poland was not\r\nmoved.  At last they saw him take the waiter aside and heard\r\nhim tell him in a loud whisper: \"The next time, make mine\r\na little stronger, if you please.\" They concluded on the whole\r\nthat Vermont brain would hold its own with Michigan and Illinois.\r\n\r\nOne of the most amusing scenes I ever witnessed was a call\r\nof the House in the old days, when there was no quorum.  The\r\ndoors were shut.  The Speaker sent officers for the absentees.\r\nThey were brought to the bar of the House one after another.\r\nJudge Poland happened to be one of the absentees.  My colleague,\r\nMr. Dawes, was in the chair.  Poland was brought to the bar.\r\nMr. Dawes addressed him with solemnity: \"Mr. Poland, of Vermont,\r\nyou have been absent from the session of the House without\r\nits leave.  What excuse have you to offer?\" The Judge paused\r\na moment and then replied in a tone of great gravity and emotion:\r\n\"I went with my wife to call on my minister, and I stayed\r\na little too long.\"  The House accepted the excuse, and I\r\nsuppose the religious people of the Judge's district would\r\nhave maintained him in office for a thousand years by virtue\r\nof that answer, if they had had their way.  A man who had\r\nbeen so long exposed to the wickedness and temptations of Washington,\r\nand had committed only the sin of staying a little too long\r\nwhen he called on his minister might safely be trusted anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Peters, of Maine, did not speak very frequently and\r\ndid not attract much public attention.  But he had a strong\r\ninfluence with the members of the House.  He was on the Judiciary\r\nCommittee.  He made brief, pithy speeches which generally\r\nconvinced the House.  He declined to continue in the National\r\nservice, where the people of Maine would have been willing\r\nto keep him until his dying day.  He afterward became Chief\r\nJustice of Maine, and sustained the high character which the\r\nBench of that State has had from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere is one anecdote of him, which does not come within\r\nthe sphere of my recollections, but which I think perhaps\r\nmy readers will prefer to anything that does.  A few years\r\nago a young man who kept a grocery store was tried before\r\nJudge Peters for larceny.  He was a very respectable young\r\ntradesman.  The Salvation Army had engaged quarters next to\r\nhis store, where they disturbed him and his customers a good\r\ndeal by playing on the drum and other similar religious services.\r\nBut that was not all.  They used to come out on the sidewalk\r\nand beat a large drum and sing and kneel in prayer just before\r\nhis door, much to the disturbance of his customers and the\r\naggravation of the young grocer.  One day he purloined and\r\nhid the large drum.  He was detected and indicted for larceny.\r\nThe Attorney-General, for the Government, maintained that\r\neverything that went to constitute the crime of larceny existed\r\nthere.  He had taken secretly another man's property from his\r\npossession, for purposes of his own.  Whether he meant to\r\ndestroy it or hide it or to convert it to his own use made\r\nno difference in the offence against the owner or against\r\nthe law.  On the other hand the defendant's counsel argued\r\nthat it was a mere matter of mischief; that there was no felonious\r\nintent, and no purpose to deprive the owner permanently of\r\nthe property.  The Chief Justice charged very strongly for\r\nthe Commonwealth.  The jury very reluctantly brought in a\r\nverdict of guilty.  The poor fellow was sorely distressed.\r\nHe was convicted as a thief.  His life seemed to be blighted\r\nand ruined past hope.  The Chief Justice said:  \"Mr. Clerk,\r\nyou may record the verdict.  I may as well sentence him now.\r\nI shall fine him a dollar, without costs.  I once stole a\r\ndrum myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn A. Logan was a member of the House when I entered it,\r\nand I served with him in the Senate also.  He was a man of\r\nremarkable power, and remarkable influence, both with the\r\nSenate and with the people.  It is, I believe, agreed by all\r\nauthorities that we had no abler officer in the Civil War\r\nthan he, except those who were educated at West Point.  He\r\nwas always a great favorite with the veteran soldiers.  He\r\nwas rough in speech, and cared little for refinements in\r\nmanner.  He was said to be an uneducated man.  But I believe\r\nhe was a man of a good many accomplishments; that he spoke\r\nsome foreign languages well, and had a pretty good knowledge\r\nof our political history.  He was exceedingly imperious and\r\ndomineering, impatient of contradiction in any matter which\r\nhe had in charge.  So he was rather an uncomfortable man to\r\nget along with.  He was especially sensitive of any ridicule\r\nor jesting at his expense.  He was supposed, I know not how\r\ntruly, to be exceedingly impatient and ready for war on any\r\nman who crossed his path.  But his behaviour when he was ordered\r\nto supersede General Thomas, just before the battle at Nashville\r\nand Franklin, is a noble instance of magnanimity.\r\n\r\nWhen Sherman started for the sea, Hood, with a large rebel\r\narmy, was in his rear.  Gen. Thomas was ordered to attack\r\nhim.  But he delayed and delayed till the authorities at Washington\r\ngrew impatient and ordered Logan to supersede Thomas.  Everybody\r\nknows the intensity of the passion for military glory.  General\r\nLogan could have carried out his orders, taken advantage of\r\nThomas's dispositions, and won himself one of the most brilliant\r\nvictories of the war, which would have had a double lustre\r\nfrom the seeming lukewarmness of his predecessor; but when\r\nhe arrived at the place of operations and learned Thomas's\r\ndispositions and the reason for his delay, he became satisfied\r\nthat the great Fabius was right and wise.  His generous nature\r\ndisdained to profit by the mistake at headquarters and to\r\nget glory for himself at the expense of a brave soldier.  So\r\nhe postponed the execution of his orders, and left Thomas\r\nin his command.  The result was the battle of Nashville and\r\nthe annihilation of Hood.  Where in military story can there\r\nbe found a brighter page than that?  That one act of magnanimous\r\nself-denial gave to American history two of its brightest\r\nnames,--the name of Thomas and the name of Logan.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother very able member of the House was Thomas A. Jenks\r\nof Rhode Island.  He never seemed to care much for that field\r\nof service, but preferred to enjoy the practice of his profession,\r\nin which he was largely employed, and was earning a large\r\nincome.  But he is entitled to honorable memory as the originator\r\nand father of the reform of the civil service in this country.\r\nHe made a very able speech in its favor in 1867 or 1868, which\r\nwas the beginning of a movement which has been successful,\r\nfor which I think the public gratitude should be shared between\r\nhim and Dorman B. Eaton.\r\n\r\n\r\nElihu B. Washburn, of Illinois, was appointed Secretary of\r\nState by General Grant, whose constant friend and supporter\r\nhe had been through his whole military career.  Washburn was\r\nbrave, vigorous and far-sighted, a man of great influence\r\nin his State and in the House.  He was prominently spoken\r\nof for the Presidency.  But with Grant and Logan as his competitors\r\nfrom his own State, there was not much chance for him.  He\r\nwas afterward Minister to France, and gained great distinction\r\nand credit by remaining in Paris throughout the siege, and\r\ngiving shelter and support to persons who were in danger from\r\nthe fury of the mob.  He earned the gratitude alike of the\r\nGermans and the French ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nHe was known as the watch dog of the Treasury, when he was\r\nin the House.  Few questionable claims against the Government\r\ncould escape his vigilance, or prevail over his formidable\r\nopposition.  But, one day, a private bill championed by his\r\nbrother, Cadwallader, passed the House while Elihu kept entirely\r\nsilent.  Somebody called out to the Speaker: \"The watch dog\r\ndon't bark when one of the family goes by.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the House, William B. Allison, of Iowa, had\r\nalready acquired great influence there.  He manifested there\r\nthe qualities that have since given him so much distinction\r\nin the Senate.  He was understood to favor what was called\r\nRevenue Reform, and moderation in the exercise of all doubtful\r\nnational powers.\r\n\r\nBut his chief distinction has been gained by a service of\r\nthirty years in the Senate.  He was out of public life two\r\nyears, and then was elected to the Senate, where he has been\r\nkept by the State of Iowa, maintaining the confidence of his\r\nState and of his associates in public life.  During all that\r\ntime he has done what no other man in the country, in my\r\njudgment, could have done so well.  He has been a member\r\nof the great Committee on Appropriations for thirty years,\r\nmost of the time Chairman, and for twenty-six years a member\r\nof the Committee on Finance.  He has controlled, more than\r\nany other man, indeed more than any other ten men, the vast\r\nand constantly increasing public expenditure, amounting now\r\nto more than 1,000 millions annually.  It has been an economical,\r\nhonest and wise expenditure.  He has been compelled in the\r\ndischarge of his duties to understand the complications and\r\nmechanism of public administration and public expenditure.\r\nThat is a knowledge in which nobody else in the Senate, except\r\nSenator Hale of Maine, and Senator Cockrell of Missouri, can\r\ncompare with him.  He has by his wise and moderate counsel\r\ndrawn the fire from many a wild and dangerous scheme which\r\nmenaced the public peace and safety.\r\n\r\nHe almost never takes part in the debates, unless it becomes\r\nnecessary to explain or defend some measure of which he has\r\ncharge.  It is said that he is very careful not to offend\r\nanybody, and that he is unwilling to take responsibilities\r\nor to commit himself.  There is undoubtedly some truth in\r\nthat criticism.  Indeed if it were otherwise, he would find\r\nit very hard to maintain the personal influence necessary\r\nto success in the duties to which he is immediately devoted.\r\nBut he never avoids voting.  His name, since he has been Senator,\r\nhas been first or second alphabetically on the roll of the\r\nSenate.  He is found in the Senate Chamber unless engaged\r\nin his committee-room on work which requires him to be there\r\nduring the sessions,--and he always votes when his name is\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nI have never seen any indication that he is interested in\r\nanything, or has any special knowledge or accomplishment,\r\nexcept what is necessary to the line of his duty.  I do not\r\nknow that he has any interest in history or literature or\r\nscience or music.  What he does in his time of recreation--\r\nif he ever has any time for recreation--I cannot tell.  He\r\nnever seems to take any active interest in any of the questions\r\nwhich determine the action of the party or the destiny of\r\nthe State, except those that relate to its finances.  I use\r\nthe word finances in the largest sense, including means for\r\nraising revenue and maintaining a sound currency, as well\r\nas public expenditures.  He is like a naval engineer, regulating\r\nthe head of steam but seldom showing himself on deck.  I think\r\nhe has had a good deal of influence in some perilous times\r\nin deciding whether the ship should keep safely on, or should\r\nrun upon a rock and go to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere is a good story told that after Thaddeus Stevens died,\r\na friend of Mr. Blaine's was walking with him one day through\r\nthe Rotunda of the Capitol toward the House of Representatives.\r\nMr. Blaine said:  \"The death of Stevens is an emancipation\r\nfor the Republican Party.  He kept the party under his heel.\"\r\nHis friend replied:  \"Whom have you got for leaders left?\"\r\nBlaine said:  \"There are three young men coming forward.  There\r\nis a young man who will be heard from yet.\" He pointed to\r\nAllison, who happened to be just approaching.  \"James A. Garfield\r\nis another.\" There was a little pause, and his friend said:\r\n\"Well, who is the third?\"  Blaine gazed straight up into\r\nthe dome, and said:  \"I don't see the third.\"\r\n\r\nI give my estimate of James A. Garfield later in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I ought not to leave out of an account of the very\r\nable and remarkable Massachusetts delegation in the Congress\r\nof 1869 the name of George S. Boutwell, although he remained\r\nin the House only a few days after I entered in and is still\r\nliving.  He had been a very faithful, useful and prominent\r\nmember of the House from the time he entered it in March,\r\n1863, at the middle of the War.\r\n\r\nIt was the desire of his associates in the House that he\r\nshould be a Member of General Grant's cabinet.  When General\r\nGrant's Cabinet was announced the name of Governor Boutwell\r\ndid not appear, and my brother, Judge Hoar, was nominated\r\nfor Attorney-General.  He had a high opinion of Mr. Boutwell\r\nand had been very earnest, so far as he could properly do\r\nso, in advocating his original nomination to Congress.  In\r\nthe evening after the Cabinet had been announced Mr. William\r\nB. Washburn, afterward Governor, called upon me at my room.\r\nMr. Washburn and I were not then intimate, although we afterward\r\nbecame close friends.  He said that he had been requested\r\nby the delegation to tell me that they earnestly hoped to\r\nMr. Boutwell might have a place in the Cabinet, and that,\r\nalthough they had great regard for Judge Hoar, they hoped\r\nthat some arrangement might still be made which would bring\r\nabout the selection of Mr. Boutwell.  I told Mr. Washburn\r\nthat I was sure that the appointment of Judge Hoar would be\r\na surprise to him, as it was to me, and that I thought it\r\nquite doubtful whether he would wish to leave his place on\r\nthe Bench for a seat in the Cabinet, but that I could not\r\nspeak for him or judge for him.  I telegraphed at once to\r\nJudge Hoar not to commit himself in any way until he reached\r\nWashington and could see me.  I met him at the depot, told\r\nhim of the communication of the Massachusetts delegation and\r\nthat, especially considering President Johnson's quarrel with\r\nCongress, it seemed quite important that General Grant, who\r\nhad no experience whatever in political life, should have\r\nsome person among his counsellors who had the full confidence\r\nof the leaders in Congress.  The Judge strongly appreciated\r\nthat view.  When he called upon President Grant his first\r\nconversation consisted in urging upon him very strongly the\r\nselection of Governor Boutwell.  He supposed then that it\r\nwould be quite unlikely that the President would take two\r\nmen from the same State and supposed that selection would\r\nrequire his own refusal of the offer of the office of Attorney-\r\nGeneral.  President Grant said that he would think it over\r\nand not decide the question that day.  The next morning he\r\nsent for the Judge and said:  \"Judge, I think I would like\r\nto have you take the oath of office.\"  He handed the Judge\r\nhis commission.  The Judge looked at it and saw that it was\r\nnot signed.  He said:  \"I think perhaps it would be better\r\nif you were to sign it.\"  Grant laughed and complied with\r\nthe suggestion.  Judge Hoar's first official duty was to give\r\nan opinion upon the question whether Mr. Stewart, who had\r\nbeen nominated for Secretary of the Treasury, could under\r\nthe law undertake the office.  Mr. Stewart proposed to make\r\nsome conveyances of his business in trust, by which he should\r\npart with his legal title to it while he held the office of\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and come back to it again after\r\nhis term ended.  But the Attorney-General advised the President\r\nthat that was impracticable, and the result was the withdrawal\r\nof Mr. Stewart's name and the appointment of Mr. Boutwell\r\na day or two afterward.\r\n\r\nI have had some serious difficulties with Mr. Boutwell since\r\nhe left the Democratic Party after his term of service as\r\nGovernor.  They have, I believe, never been differences of\r\npolitical principle.  My differences of opinion with him have\r\nbeen mainly upon the question what individuals were fit to\r\nbe trusted with political office and power, and with the leadership\r\nin political parties, and upon the question whether certain\r\nmen and influences were to be tolerated, or whether the public\r\nsafety required unsparing warfare upon them.  So, while we\r\nhave agreed in general as to policies, we have always had\r\nan entirely different set of friends and companions.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell has borne an honorable part in our history.\r\nHis titles to a place in the grateful memory of his countrymen\r\nare not likely to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nOne of them deserves special mention.  I am but repeating\r\nwhat I said many years ago.  As a leading member of the House\r\nof Representatives, and as Secretary of the Treasury under\r\nPresident Grant's Administration, he had, of course, a large\r\ninfluence upon our financial history.  He saw very early the\r\nimportance of devoting every resource of the country to the\r\nreduction of the National debt.  It was not with him, as I\r\nunderstand it, a question whether a little saving could be\r\nmade in the way of taxes by postponing the payment until the\r\nrate of interest should be less or the National resources\r\ngreater.  He saw that it was important that the people should\r\nnot get accustomed, as the English people are, to consider\r\na National debt as something that was to continue always.\r\nHe saw that it was important to the character of the people,\r\nas to an individual, that they should be impatient and restless\r\nunder the obligation of debt, and should consider it alike\r\nthe Nation's first duty and its greatest pride and luxury\r\nto get rid of the burden.  This has always been the temper\r\nof the State of Massachusetts, of her towns, and, in general,\r\nof her citizens.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he insisted that the debt should be reduced so\r\nrapidly that the people would take pride in having paid it,\r\nand would be relieved from the temptation of listening to\r\nthe specious and seductive arguments of persons contriving\r\ndishonest methods of getting rid of it by issuing fiat money,\r\nor any device of direct or indirect repudiation.  Many persons\r\ncan remember in what dangerous forms this temptation came,\r\nand how many men, who otherwise deserve to be held in high\r\nesteem, yielded to it wholly or partly.  Mr. Boutwell's powerful\r\ninfluence was a very important factor in attaining the result\r\nin which we all now take so much satisfaction, and keeping\r\nthe American people in the path of duty and honor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Wheeler, of New York, entered the House in 1869.\r\nI soon became very well acquainted with him, an acquaintance\r\nwhich ripened into a very intimate friendship.  He was a very\r\nserious, simple-hearted and wise man.  There was no man in\r\nhis time who had more influence in the House.  His ancestors\r\ndwelt in my native town of Concord in the early generations,\r\nand in Lincoln, which had been part of Concord.  One of the\r\nfamily emigrated to Vermont.  Wheeler's father went from Vermont\r\nto Malone, New York, where he was born, and where he was left\r\nby his father an orphan in very early youth.  The widow and\r\nchildren were without any property whatever, but got along\r\nsomehow.  Wheeler got an education, spending two or three\r\nyears in college, and became the foremost man in his part\r\nof New York.  The people of his district were in character\r\nand way of thinking very much like our best Massachusetts\r\nconstituencies.  Wheeler had little respect for the devious\r\nand self-seeking politics which are supposed to have been\r\nneeded for success in that State.  He very much disliked Roscoe\r\nConkling, and all his ways.  Conkling once said to him: \"Wheeler,\r\nif you will join us and act with us, there is nothing in the\r\ngift of the State of New York to which you may not reasonably\r\naspire.\"  To which Wheeler replied:  \"Mr. Conkling, there\r\nis nothing in the gift of the State of New York which will\r\ncompensate me for the forfeiture of my own self respect.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wheeler was one of the sub-committee, of whom Mr. Frye\r\nand myself were the other two Republican members, to inquire\r\ninto the condition of the legality of the Kellogg State Government\r\nof Louisiana.  He suggested what is known as the Wheeler\r\ncompromise, the acceptance of which by both sides was due\r\nto his influence and capacity for conciliation.  The compromise\r\nconsisted in an agreement to allow the Republican State officers\r\nto remain in office during the remainder of their terms, without\r\nturbulent or factious opposition, to submit quietly to their\r\nauthority on the one hand, and that the two Houses of the\r\nLegislature, on the other hand, should seat the Democratic\r\ncontestants whom our sub-committee found entitled to their\r\nseats.  This compromise in reality gave effect to the opinion\r\nof the committee, as if they had been a tribunal of arbitration.\r\nOf course they had no authority to enforce their opinion against\r\nthe objection of either party.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the nomination of President Hayes was declared\r\nin the Convention of 1876, I spent a very busy hour in going\r\nabout among the delegates whom I knew, especially those from\r\nthe Southern States, to urge upon them the name of Mr. Wheeler\r\nas a suitable person for Vice-President.  I have no doubt\r\nI secured for him his election.  Mr. James Russell Lowell\r\nwas a Massachusetts delegate.  He was a little unwilling to\r\nvote for a person of whom he had no more knowledge.  I said\r\nto him:  \"Mr. Lowell, Mr. Wheeler is a very sensible man.\r\nHe knows the 'Biglow Papers' by heart.\" Lowell gave no promise\r\nin reply.  But I happened to overhear him, as he sat behind\r\nme, saying to James Freeman Clarke, I think it was: \"I understand\r\nthat Mr. Wheeler is 'a very sensible man.'\"\r\n\r\nWheeler was one of the best parliamentarians and one of the\r\nbest presiding officers I ever knew.  He had no children.\r\nIt is pathetic to remember the affection which existed between\r\nhim and his wife.  Their long living together had brought\r\nabout a curious resemblance.  She looked like him, talked\r\nlike him, thought like him, and if she had been dressed in\r\nhis clothes, or he had been in hers, either might have passed\r\nfor the other.  When she died Wheeler seemed to lose all interest\r\nin this world, shut himself off from all ordinary activities,\r\nand died a year or two after, I suppose with a broken heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS IN 1869\r\n\r\nWhen the Republican Party came into power in 1869 under its\r\ngreat and simple-hearted President, it found itself confronted\r\nwith very serious duties.  They were enough to fill ordinary\r\nmen in ordinary times with dismay.  The President was without\r\npolitical experience.  He had never held civil office.  He\r\nhad voted but twice in his life.  He had voted the Whig ticket\r\nonce and the Democratic ticket once.  So he could not justly\r\nbe charged with being an offensive partisan.  He had no experience\r\nin business except in a humble way and in that he had been\r\nunfortunate.  Congress and the President could only act under\r\nthe restraint of a written Constitution.  Everything done\r\nby either must pass the ordeal of the Supreme Court, a majority\r\nof whose members then had no sympathy with a liberal interpretation\r\nof the National powers.  The Chief Justice had been a great\r\nRepublican leader.  But he had quarrelled with Lincoln, and\r\nwas an eager aspirant for the Democratic nomination for the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nOf the eight years after the inauguration of Lincoln more\r\nthan four had been years of actual war and more than five\r\npassed before formal declaration of peace.  During all this\r\ntime nothing could be considered but the preservation of the\r\nUnion.  From the end of the War to the accession of President\r\nGrant, Congress and the President had been engaged in a struggle\r\nwith each other for power.  President Johnson had been impeached\r\nand put on trial before the Senate.  So there could be no\r\nimportant legislation from the summer of 1866 until March,\r\n1869, that did not command the assent of two thirds of both\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\nYet the feeling everywhere among the Republicans in Washington\r\nand throughout the North was of exultant and confident courage.\r\nThe strength of the Nation had been tried and not found wanting.\r\nIt had overthrown a mighty rebellion.  The burden of slavery,\r\nwhich had hung like a millstone about the neck of the Republic,\r\nhad been thrown off.  Congress had been triumphant in its\r\ncontest with the President.  The loyal people of the country\r\nlooked to Grant with an almost superstitious hope.  They were\r\nprepared to expect almost any miracle from the great genius\r\nwho had subdued the rebellion, and conducted without failure\r\nmilitary operations on a scale of which the world up to that\r\ntime had had no experience.  So the dominant party addressed\r\nitself without fear to the great work before it.\r\n\r\nThey had to determine on what conditions the States that\r\nhad been in rebellion should come back to their place under\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThey were to determine on what terms the men who had taken\r\npart in the rebellion should be fully restored to citizenship.\r\n\r\nThey were to determine the civil and political condition\r\nof more than five million people just set free from slavery.\r\n\r\nThey were to secure fair elections in fifteen States, where\r\nfor many years neither free elections nor free speech had\r\nbeen tolerated.\r\n\r\nIf they could, they were to reconcile the North and the South,\r\nestranged by a strife so bitter that even before the War the\r\nlife of no Northern man who dared to utter Northern opinions\r\nwas safe in half the States of the country, and which had\r\nbeen intensified by four years of bloody war--bellum plus\r\nquam civile--which had left nearly every household in the\r\ncountry mourning for its dead.\r\n\r\nThey were to confront the greatest temptation that ever besets\r\nmen of Anglo-Saxon race, a race ever restless and ever hungry\r\nfor empire.  Hungry eyes were already bent on San Domingo\r\nand Cuba.  Good men were rendered uneasy by the tales of Spanish\r\noppression in Cuba.  Men who were looking for the union of\r\nthe two oceans by a canal across the Isthmus, or who hoped\r\nthat we should extend our dominion in this continent southward,\r\nlooked upon the island belonging to the Negro Republics of\r\nHayti and San Domingo as a desirable addition to our military\r\nand naval strength.\r\n\r\nThey were to provide for the payment of an enormous debt.\r\n\r\nThey were to accomplish the resumption of specie payment.\r\n\r\nThey were to consider and determine anew the question of\r\ncurrency.  What should be the standard of value and a legal\r\ntender for the payment of debts?\r\n\r\nThey were to get rid of the vast burden of war taxes which\r\npressed heavily upon all branches of business.\r\n\r\nThey were to decide whether the duties on imports which\r\nhad been laid to meet the heavy cost of war should be kept\r\nin peace and whether to follow the counsel of Hamilton and\r\nhis associates in the first Administration of Washington, or\r\nthe counsel of the free traders and the English school of\r\npolitical economics, in determining whether American industry\r\nshould be protected.\r\n\r\nThe people felt that they had suffered a grievous wrong from\r\nEngland, and that unless there were reparation, which England\r\nhad so far steadily refused either to make or consider, the\r\nhonor of the country required that we should exact it by war.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants from foreign lands who had come to our shores\r\nin vast numbers, and were coming in rapidly increasing numbers,\r\nwere made uneasy by the doctrine of perpetual allegiance on\r\nwhich all Europe insisted.  They claimed that they were entitled\r\nto protection like native-born American citizens everywhere\r\non the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe number of civil officers appointed by the Executive had\r\nlargely increased.  This put an undue and most dangerous\r\npower into the hands of the party controlling the Government.\r\nThere was a strong feeling that this should be checked.\r\n\r\nBesides; during the controversy with Andrew Johnson the members\r\nof the two Houses of Congress had come to think that they\r\nwere entitled to control all appointments of civil officers\r\nin their own States and Districts, and they were ready with\r\nscarce an exception to stand by each other in this demand.\r\nThey had passed, over the veto of President Johnson, an act\r\nof disputed and quite doubtful constitutionality, seriously\r\ncrippling the Executive power of removal from office, without\r\nwhich the President's constitutional duty to see that the\r\nlaws are faithfully executed cannot be performed.  So each\r\nSenator and Representative was followed like a Highland Chieftain\r\n\"with his tail on,\" by a band of retainers devoted to his\r\npolitical fortunes, dependent upon him for their own, but\r\nsupported at the public charge.\r\n\r\nThis not only threatened the freedom of election, but itself\r\nbrought a corrupting influence into the Administration of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nBut there was a still greater danger than all these in the\r\ncorruption which then, as always, followed a great war.  Unprincipled\r\nand greedy men sought to get contracts and jobs from the Government\r\nby the aid of influential politicians.  This aid they paid\r\nfor sometimes, though I think rarely, in money, and in contributions\r\nto political campaigns, and in the various kinds of assistance\r\nnecessary to maintain in power the men to whom they were so\r\nindebted.  This corruption not only affected all branches\r\nof the Civil Service, especially the War and the Navy and\r\nthe Treasury, but poisoned legislation itself.\r\n\r\nThey had to deal with claims amounting to hundreds of millions\r\nof dollars, some wholly fraudulent, some grossly exaggerated\r\nand some entirely just.  Some of these belonged to persons\r\nwho had contracts with the Government for constructing and\r\nsupplying a powerful Navy, or for supplies to the Army.  There\r\nwere demands still larger in amount from the inhabitants of\r\nthe territory which had been the theatre of the War.  This\r\nclass of claims was wholly new in the history of our own country.\r\nThere were few precedents for dealing with them in the experience\r\nof other countries, and the Law of Nations and the law of\r\nwar furnished imperfect guides.\r\n\r\nMen wounded or disabled in the Military or Naval Service,\r\nand their widows and orphans, were to be provided for by a\r\nliberal pension system.\r\n\r\nThese were a part only of the questions that must be studied\r\nand understood, under the gravest personal responsibility\r\nby every member of either House of Congress.  Under the Administration\r\nof Grant and those that succeeded, of course, there was a\r\nconstant struggle on the part of the party in power to keep\r\nin power and on the part of its opponent to get power.  So\r\nthat it was necessary that a Representative or Senator who\r\nwould do his duty, or who had the ordinary ambition, or desired\r\nthat the counsel best for the country should prevail, should\r\nmaster these subjects and take a large part in discussing\r\nand advocating the policy of his party.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty-two years from the 4th of March, 1869,\r\nto the 4th of March, 1901, the Democratic Party held the\r\nExecutive power of the country for eight years.  For nearly\r\nfour years more Andrew Johnson had a bitter quarrel with\r\nthe Republican leaders in both Houses of Congress.  For six\r\nyears the Democrats controlled the Senate.  For sixteen years\r\nthey controlled the House of Representatives.  There is left\r\non the Statute Book no trace of any Democratic legislation\r\nduring this whole period except the repeal of the laws intended\r\nto secure honest elections.  The two Administrations of President\r\nCleveland are remembered by the business men and the laboring\r\nmen of the country only as terrible nightmares.  Whatever\r\nhas been accomplished in this period, which seems to me the\r\nmost brilliant period in legislative history of any country\r\nin the world, has been accomplished by the Republican Party\r\nover Democratic opposition.  The failure to secure honest\r\nNational elections and the political and civil rights of the\r\ncolored people is the failure of the Republican Party and\r\nthe success of its Democratic antagonist.  With that exception,\r\nto all the problems which confronted the country in 1869 the\r\nRepublican Party has given a simple, wise, final and most\r\nsuccessful solution.  It has done it not only without help, but\r\nover the constant opposition of its Democratic antagonist.\r\n\r\nEvery State that went into the Rebellion has been restored\r\nto its place in the Union.\r\n\r\nThere has been complete and universal amnesty.  No man has\r\nbeen punished for his share in the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of dishonest and subtle counsel, and in spite of\r\ngreat temptation, we have dealt with the public debt on the\r\nsimple and honest principle that the only thing to do with a\r\ndebt is to pay it.  The National credit is the best in the\r\nworld, and the National debt has ceased to be an object either\r\nof anxiety or consideration.\r\n\r\nSpecie payments have been resumed.  Every dollar issued by\r\nthe Government, or by national banks under government authority,\r\npasses current like gold.  Indeed the ease with which it can\r\nbe transported and the certainty of its redemption makes the\r\npaper money of the United States better than gold.\r\n\r\nThe United States has joined the commercial nations of the\r\nfirst rank in making gold the world's standard of value.\r\nIn doing this we have never departed from the theoretical\r\nprinciple of bimetallism as announced by Hamilton and Washington\r\nand Webster and all our statesmen without exception down to\r\n1869.  The contest was an exceedingly close one.  The arguments\r\nin support of the free coinage of silver were specious and\r\ndangerous.  Undoubtedly for a time, and more than once, they\r\nconverted a majority of the American people.  The battle for\r\nhonest money would have been lost but for the wisdom of the\r\nRepublican statesmen who planted the party not only upon the\r\ndoctrine of theoretical bimetallism, but also upon the doctrine\r\nthat the question of the standard of value must be settled\r\nby the concurrence of the commercial nations of the world\r\nand that if there were to be one metal as a standard, gold,\r\nthe most valuable metal, was the fittest for the purpose.\r\nThat was the doctrine of Alexander Hamilton.  To have avowed\r\nany other principle would have reinforced our opponents with\r\nthe powerful authority of Hamilton and all his disciples\r\ndown to the year 1873.\r\n\r\nThe war taxes have been abolished.  The weight of the burden\r\nwhich has been in that way lifted from the shoulders of the\r\npeople may perhaps be understood from the statement of a single\r\nfact.  The Worcester District, which I represented, paid in\r\nthe direct form of taxes to the National Treasury the enormous\r\nsum of $3,662,727 for the year ending June 30, 1866.  For\r\nthe year ending June 30, 1871, the taxes so paid amounted\r\nin all to $225,000, and for the year ending June 30, 1872,\r\nthey amounted to about $100,000.\r\n\r\nThe policy of protection to American industry, which, like\r\nthe question of honest elections, has been always in contest\r\nbetween the Republican Party and its Democratic antagonist\r\nhas, unless during the two Administrations of President Cleveland,\r\nbeen successfully maintained.  As a consequence of that policy\r\nour manufacturing independence has been achieved.  The United\r\nStates has become the foremost manufacturing nation in the\r\nworld.  We are penetrating foreign markets, and have built\r\nup a domestic commerce, the like of which has never been seen\r\nbefore, and whose extent surpasses the power of human imagination\r\nto conceive and almost of mathematics to calculate.\r\n\r\nThe temptation to extend our territory by unlawful exercise\r\nof power over Cuba and San Domingo was resisted by the American\r\npeople.  Cuba has been liberated and has taken her place among\r\nthe free nations of the world.\r\n\r\nFor the great offence committed against us by Great Britain\r\nin the hour of our peril we have exacted apology and reparation.\r\nThere were not wanting counsellors enough to urge the American\r\npeople that we should nurse this grievance and lie in wait\r\nuntil the hour for our revenge should come.  But the magnanimous\r\nAmerican people preferred peace and reconciliation to revenge.\r\nI ought to except this from the list of achievements due to\r\nthe Republican Party alone.  In the matter of the British\r\nTreaty, the Democratic leaders contributed their full share\r\nto its successful accomplishment.  Mr. Justice Nelson of\r\nthe United States Supreme Court was a distinguished member\r\nof the Commission that made the Treaty.\r\n\r\nUnder General Grant's Administration treaties were negotiated\r\nwith nearly all the great powers of the world by which they\r\nrenounced the old doctrine of perpetual allegiance, and the\r\nAmerican citizen of foreign birth is clothed with all the\r\nrights and privileges of a native-born citizen wherever on\r\nthe face of the earth he may go.\r\n\r\nThe vast number of the National offices has ceased to be a\r\nmenace to the safety of the Republic and has ceased to be a\r\nsource of strength to the Administration in power, or to\r\nbecome the price or reward of political activity.  The offices\r\nof trust and profit now exist to serve the people and not to\r\nbribe them.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the Senate and the Executive which arose\r\nin the time of Andrew Johnson, when Congress undertook to\r\nhamper and restrict the President's Constitutional power of\r\nremoval from office, without which his Constitutional duty\r\nof seeing that the laws are faithfully executed cannot be\r\nperformed, has been settled by a return to the ancient principle\r\nestablished in Washington's first Administration.\r\n\r\nThe vast claims upon the Treasury growing out of the war have\r\nbeen dealt with upon wise and simple principles which have\r\ncommanded general assent and in the main have resulted in\r\ndoing full justice both to the Government and to the claimant.\r\n\r\nA disputed title to the Executive power which threatened\r\nto bring on another civil war, and which would not have been\r\nsettled without bloodshed in any other country, has been peacefully\r\nand quietly disposed of by the simple mechanism devised for\r\nthe occasion and by the enactment of a rule which will protect\r\nthe country against a like danger in the future.\r\n\r\nWith all these matters I have had something to do.\r\n\r\nAs to some of them my part has been a very humble one.  As\r\nto others I have had a part of considerable prominence.  As\r\nto all I have had full and intimate knowledge at the time\r\nand have been in the intimate counsel of the men who were\r\nresponsible for the result.\r\n\r\nBeside all these things there has been during a large part\r\nof my public service, especially the part immediately following\r\nthe Civil War, a battle to maintain the purity of elections\r\nand the purity of administration and government expenditure\r\nagainst corruption.  The attempt to get possession of the\r\nforces of the Government for corrupt purposes assumed its\r\nmost dangerous form and had its most unscrupulous and dangerous\r\nleader in Massachusetts.  It was my fortune to have a good\r\ndeal to do with maintaining the ancient honor of the Commonwealth\r\nand defending and vindicating the purity of her political\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nUpon all these matters I formed my opinions carefully in the\r\nbeginning.  I have adhered to those opinions, and acted on\r\nthem throughout.  I formed them in many cases when they were\r\nshared by a few persons only.  But they have made their way,\r\nand prevail.  They are the opinions upon which the majority\r\nof the American people have acted, and the reasons which have\r\ncontrolled that action, seem to me now, in looking backward,\r\nto have been good reasons.  I have no regret, and no desire\r\nto blot out anything I have said or done, or to change any\r\nvote I have given.\r\n\r\nThe duties of a Representative and Senator demand a large\r\ncorrespondence.  I have had always the aid of intelligent and\r\ncompetent secretaries.  Disposing of the day's mail, even\r\nwith such aid, is not infrequently a hard day's work, especially\r\nfor a man past three score and ten.\r\n\r\nPolitical campaigns in Massachusetts with its small territory\r\nand compact population are easy as compared with most of the\r\nother States.  But I have been expected every second year\r\nto make many political speeches, commonly from thirty to forty.\r\nMr. Blaine, and Mr. Fry, and Mr. Reed, and a great many others\r\nwho could be named, were called on for a much larger number.\r\nA man at all prominent in public affairs is also expected\r\nto give utterance to the voice of the people on all great\r\noccasions of joy or sorrow, at high festivals, or at colleges\r\nand schools, on great National anniversaries, when great men\r\ndie and great historical events are celebrated.  So it was\r\na life of hard work upon which I entered when I took my seat\r\nin the House of Representatives on the 4th of March, 1869.\r\nThe thirty-four years that have followed have been for me\r\nyears of incessant labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nRECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction policy of the Republican Party has been\r\nbitterly denounced.  Some men who supported it are in the\r\nhabit now of calling it a failure.  It never commanded in\r\nits fullest extent the cordial support of the whole party.\r\nBut it was very simple.  So far as it applied to the Southern\r\nwhites who had been in rebellion it consisted only of complete\r\namnesty and full restoration to political rights.  No man\r\nwas ever punished for taking part in the rebellion after\r\nhe laid down his arms.  There is no other instance of such\r\nmagnanimity in history.  The War left behind it little bitterness\r\nin the hearts of the conquerors.  All they demanded of the\r\nconquered was submission in good faith to the law of the land\r\nand the will of the people as it might be constitutionally\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nTheir policy toward the colored people was simply the application\r\nto them of the principles applied to the whites, as set forth\r\nin the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution\r\nof nearly every State in the Union.  There was to be no distinction\r\nin political rights by reason of color or race.  The States\r\nwere left to regulate such qualifications as residence, character,\r\nintelligence, education and property as they saw fit, only\r\nsubject to the condition that they were to apply to all alike.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of the dominant party to leave the control\r\nof the election of national officers, as it had been left\r\nfrom the beginning, in the hands of the local or State authorities.\r\nThe power was claimed, indeed it is clearly given by the Constitution,\r\nas was asserted in the debates in the Convention that framed\r\nit, to conduct those elections under National authority, if\r\nit should be found by experience to be necessary.  But in\r\nfact there was at no time any attempt to go further with National\r\nelection laws than to provide for punishment of fraudulent\r\nor violent interference with elections or for a sufficient\r\nprovision to ascertain that they were properly conducted,\r\nor to protect them against violence or fraud.\r\n\r\nBeside this it was the desire of many Republican leaders,\r\nespecially of Mr. Sumner and General Grant, that there should\r\nbe a provision at the National charge for the education of\r\nall the citizens in the Southern States, black and white,\r\nso far as the States were unable or unwilling to afford it,\r\nsuch as had been provided for in the States of the North\r\nfor all their citizens.  It was never contemplated by them\r\nto give the right to vote to a large number of illiterate\r\ncitizens, without ample provision for their education at the\r\npublic charge.  General Grant accompanied his official announcement\r\nto Congress of the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment with\r\nan earnest recommendation of such a provision.  Earnest efforts\r\nwere made to accomplish this result by liberal grants from\r\nthe National treasury.  Many liberal and patriotic Southern\r\nDemocrats supported it.  But it was defeated by the timidity,\r\nor mistaken notions of economy, of Northern statesmen.  In\r\nmy opinion this defeat accounts for the failure of the policy\r\nof reconstruction so far as it has failed.  I do not believe\r\nthat self-government with universal suffrage could be maintained\r\nlong in any Northern State, or in any country in the world,\r\nwithout ample provision for public education.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed with great sincerity and not without\r\nplausible reason that a great hardship and wrong was inflicted\r\nby the victorious North on their fellow citizens when the\r\npolitical power in their States was given over to their former\r\nslaves.  This consideration had great force in the minds of\r\nmany influential Republicans in the North.  Governor Andrew\r\nof Massachusetts, Governor Morton of Indiana, afterward Senator,\r\nmen whose influence was probably unsurpassed by any other\r\ntwo men in the country, save Grant and Sumner alone, were\r\nof that way of thinking.  They thought that our true policy\r\nwas to let the men who had led their States into the Rebellion\r\ntake the responsibility of restoring them to their old relations.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that the strength of the Republican Party\r\nwould have been seriously impaired, perhaps overthrown, by\r\nthe division of sentiment on this subject.  But the white\r\nDemocrats in the South were blind to their own interest.  President\r\nJohnson permitted them in several States to take into their\r\nhands again the power of government.  They proceeded to pass\r\nlaws which if carried out would have had the effect of reducing\r\nthe negro once more to a condition of practical slavery.  Men\r\nwere to be sold for the crime of being out of work.  Their\r\nold masters were to have the preference in the purchase.  So\r\nthe whole Republican Party of the North came to be united\r\nin the belief that there could be no security for the liberty\r\nof the freedman without the ballot.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this reconstruction policy has been a failure.\r\nUndoubtedly it has not gained all that was hoped for it by\r\nits advocates.  But looking back now I do not believe that\r\nany other policy would have done as well as that has done,\r\nalthough a large part of what was designed by the Republican\r\nleaders of the period of reconstruction never was accomplished.\r\n\r\nA complete system of education at the National charge was\r\nan essential element of the reconstruction policy.  It was\r\nearnestly advocated by Sumner and by Grant and by Edmunds\r\nand by Evarts.  But there were other Republicans of great\r\ninfluence who resisted it from the beginning.  Among these\r\nwas Senator Eugene Hale of Maine, a very accomplished Senator,\r\nan able debater and a man of large influence with his colleagues.\r\nHis public life has been one of great distinction and usefulness.\r\nWhile an earnest partisan he has given an example of independence\r\nof action on several notable occasions.  But he always seemed\r\nto be possessed by what seems to prevail among the Republicans\r\nof Maine to a great extent, dislike for what is called sentimental\r\npolitics.  Mr. Hale always seemed to think that the chief\r\nfunction of Congress was to provide for an honest, economical,\r\nwise and at the same time liberal public expenditure, to keep\r\nin the old paths and leave other matters alone.  He dislikes\r\nnew doctrines and new policies.  He is specially adverse to\r\nanything like legal restraint.  He once in my hearing used\r\na very felicitous phrase, full of wisdom, \"Government by good\r\nnature.\"  John Sherman, who had originally been an earnest\r\nadvocate of a liberal National expenditure for education,\r\njoined the ranks of its opponents, putting his opposition\r\nlargely on the ground that he was unwilling to trust the Southern\r\nstates with the expenditure of large sums of money.  He feared\r\nthat the money would not be fairly expended, as between the\r\ntwo races, and that it would be made a large corruption fund\r\nfor political purposes.\r\n\r\nSo this most essential part of the reconstruction policy\r\nof Sumner and Grant never took effect.  Mr. Sumner deemed\r\nthis matter vital to success.  He told me about a week before\r\nhis death that when the resolution declaring the provision\r\nfor public education at the National charge an essential part\r\nof the reconstruction policy, was defeated in the Senate by\r\na tie vote, he was so overcome by his feelings that he burst\r\ninto tears and left the Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the Republican plan for reconstruction was\r\nnever accomplished.  That was the securing of a fair vote\r\nand a fair ascertainment of the result in National elections\r\nby National power.  Some partial and imperfect attempts were\r\nmade to put in force laws intended to accomplish this result.\r\nThey never went farther than enactments designed to maintain\r\norder at the polls, to secure the voter from actual violence,\r\nand to provide for such scrutiny as to make it clear that\r\nthe vote was duly counted and properly returned, with a right\r\nof appeal to the Courts of the United States in case of a\r\ncontest, the decision of the Court to be subject to the final\r\nauthority of the House of Representatives.  These laws, although\r\nthey had the support of eminent and zealous Democrats and\r\nalthough they were as much needed and had as much application\r\nto the Northern cities as to the Southern States, were the\r\nobject of bitter denunciation from the beginning.  Good men\r\nin the North listened with incredulity to the narrative of\r\nwell established facts of cruelty and murder and fraud.  These\r\nstories were indignantly denied at the time, although they\r\nare not only confessed, but vauntingly and triumphantly affirmed\r\nnow.  The whole country seems to be made uneasy when the old\r\npractice to which it had been accustomed everywhere of having\r\noffences tried by a jury taken by lot from the people of the\r\nneighborhood, and the result of election ascertained by officers\r\nselected from the bystanders at the polls, is departed from.\r\nBesides, no strictness of laws which provide only for the\r\nproceedings at the elections will secure their freedom if\r\nit be possible to intimidate the voters, especially men like\r\nthe colored voters at the South, from attending the elections,\r\nby threats, outrages and actual violence at their homes.  Against\r\nthese the election laws could not guard.  Congress attempted\r\nsome laws to secure the Southern Republicans against such\r\ncrimes under the authority conferred by the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution.  But the Supreme Court held that these\r\nlaws were unconstitutional, it not appearing that the States\r\nhad by any affirmative action denied protection against such\r\noffences to any class of their citizens by reason of race,\r\ncolor, or previous condition.  It was idle to expect Southern\r\njurors, or State officers to enforce the law against such\r\ncrimes in the condition of sentiment existing there.\r\n\r\nFurther, the people of the North would not maintain the Republican\r\nParty in power forever on this one issue alone.  They were\r\ninterested in other things.  They could not be expected, year\r\nafter year, election after election, and perhaps generation\r\nafter generation, to hold together by reason of this one question,\r\ndiffering on other things.  So whenever the Democratic Party\r\nshould come into power it was apparent that all the vigor\r\nwould be taken out of the election laws.  If there be not\r\npower to repeal them the House of Representatives can always\r\nrefuse to make the appropriation for enforcing them.  So it\r\nbecame clear to my mind, and to the minds of many other Republicans,\r\nthat it was better to leave this matter to the returning and\r\ngrowing sense of justice of the people of the South than to\r\nhave laws on this subject passed in one Administration, only\r\nto be repealed in another.  A policy to be effective must\r\nbe permanent.  I accordingly announced in the Senate after\r\nthe defeat of the Elections Bill in 1894 that in my judgment\r\nit would not be wise to renew the attempt to control National\r\nelection by National authority until both parties in the country\r\nshould agree upon that subject.\r\n\r\nWe should have had little difficulty in dealing with the\r\nNegro or the Indian, or the Oriental, if the American people\r\nhad applied to them, as the Golden Rule requires, the principles\r\nthey expect to apply and to have applied to themselves.  We\r\nhave never understood that in some essential matters human\r\nnature is the same in men of all colors and races.  Our Fathers\r\nof the time of the Revolution understood this matter better\r\nthan we do.  The difficult problems in our national politics\r\nat this hour will nearly all of them be solved if the people\r\nwill adhere to rules of conduct imposed as restraints in the\r\nearly constitutions.  The sublimity of the principle of self-\r\ngovernment does not consist wholly or chiefly in the idea\r\nthat self is the person who governs, but quite as much in\r\nthe doctrine that self is the person who is governed.  How\r\nour race troubles would disappear if the dominant Saxon would\r\nbut obey, in his treatment of the weaker races, the authority\r\nof the fundamental laws on which his own institutions rest!\r\nThe problem of to-day is not how to convert the heathen from\r\nheathenism, it is how to convert the Christian from heathenism;\r\nnot to teach the physician to heal the patient, but to heal\r\nhimself.  The Indian problem is not chiefly how to teach the\r\nIndian to be less savage in his treatment of the Saxon, but\r\nthe Saxon to be less savage in his treatment of the Indian.\r\nThe Chinese problem is not how to keep Chinese laborers out\r\nof California, but how to keep Chinese politics out of Congress.\r\nThe negro question will be settled when the education of the\r\nwhite man is complete.\r\n\r\nWe make every allowance for ourselves.  We expect mankind\r\nto make every allowance for us.  We expect to be forgiven\r\nfor our own wrong-doing.  We easily forgive our own white\r\nfellow citizens for the unutterable and terrible cruelties\r\nthey have committed on men of other races.  But if a people\r\njust coming out of slavery or barbarism commit a hundredth\r\npart of the same offence our righteous indignation knows no\r\nbounds.  We have no recognition for their eager desire for\r\ncivilization or for liberty, no generous appreciation of their\r\nimprovement and promise.  And the thousand things in them\r\nthat give promise of good in the future are disregarded if\r\nthere be any trace left in them of the old barbarism.\r\n\r\nHas Reconstruction been a failure?  Let us see about that.\r\nWe must remember that the relations of the black and white\r\nraces to each other, which have existed almost from the foundation\r\nof the world, cannot be changed in a single generation.  It\r\nis but thirty-three years since General Grant and the two\r\nHouses of Congress, in political accord with him and with\r\neach other, took possession of the Government.  That possession\r\nhas been interrupted more than once.  It is but forty years\r\nsince slavery was abolished.  It is less than thirty years\r\nsince the last of the three great Amendments to the Constitution\r\ntook effect.  What has happened in that time? Slavery has\r\nbeen abolished.  That is not a failure.  The negro owns his\r\nright to his own labor.  He cannot be separated from his wife\r\nor children.  He is not prevented by law from learning to\r\nread the Bible.  These things are not failures.  He can own\r\nland.  He has schools and colleges.  The young colored man\r\nis received as an equal into nearly every Northern college\r\nand university.  He has frequently taken the highest university\r\nhonors.  I suppose he does not know, from the behavior of\r\nhis companions, that they think of the difference between\r\nthe color of his skin and theirs.  His right to vote is secure\r\nin thirty-four of the forty-five States of the Union.  So\r\nfar, there has been no failure.  When the Civil War broke\r\nout, there were fifteen slave States and sixteen free States.\r\nIn Maryland, Delaware, and West Virginia the negro seems to\r\nhave his place now like other citizens.  The same thing probably\r\nis true in St. Louis, and likely to be true before long throughout\r\nMissouri.  There are thirty States out of forty-five, and\r\nthere will before long probably be thirty-five out of fifty\r\nin which the old race feeling, growing out of slavery has\r\nnever got a hold.  The old race-hatred of the negro is getting\r\ninto a corner.  So far reconstruction has not been a failure.\r\n\r\nTwo things are not yet accomplished.  There are eleven States\r\nin which the negro is not yet secure in his political rights;\r\nand there are as many, and perhaps two or three more, in which\r\nif he be suspected of a crime of the first magnitude, he is\r\nlikely to undergo a cruel death, without a trial.  That would\r\nhave been quite as likely, indeed a good deal more likely\r\nto have happened, if the reconstruction measures had never\r\nbeen enacted.\r\n\r\nIt is a bad thing that any man who has the Constitutional\r\nright to vote should fail to have his vote received and counted.\r\nBut I think it is a fair question whether the existence of\r\nthis condition throughout so large a country, with the prospect\r\nthat slowly and gradually as the negro improves he will get\r\nhis rights, be not better than the alternative which must\r\nhave been his reduction to slavery again, or what is nearly\r\nas bad, a race of peons in this country.  That is the question\r\ninto the answer of which so much prejudice enters that it\r\nis hardly worth while to reason about it.  My opinion is that\r\nas the colored man gets land, becomes chaste, frugal, temperate,\r\nindustrious, veracious, that he will gradually acquire respect,\r\nand will attain political equality.  Let us not be in a hurry.\r\nEvils, if they be evils, which have existed from the foundation\r\nof the world, are not to be cured in the lifetime of a single\r\nman.  The men of the day of reconstruction were controlled\r\nby the irresistible logic of events; by a power higher than\r\ntheir own.  I could see no alternative then, and I see no\r\nalternative now, better than that which was adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nCOMMITTEE SERVICE IN THE HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe career of a Member of either House of Congress is determined,\r\nexcept in rare cases, by his assignment to Committees.  In\r\nthe House that is wholly dependent on the favor of the Speaker.\r\nIn the Senate those assignments are made by Committees of\r\nthe two parties, chosen for the purpose, who first agree on\r\nthe representation to be assigned to each.  After the Senator\r\nhas been assigned to a Committee he remains there unless he\r\nhimself desire a change, and if the Members older in the service\r\nretire he succeeds in the end to the Chairmanship of the Committee.\r\nThere has been no instance of a departure from this rule,\r\nexcept when there is a change in the political control of\r\nthe body, and no instance of deposing a Member from a Committee\r\nwithout his consent, except the single and well-known case\r\nof Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\nI was always on friendly terms with Mr. Blaine during my entire\r\nservice of eight years in the House of Representatives.  But\r\nI owed nothing to any favor of his in the matter of Committee\r\nassignments.  When I entered the service I was put on the\r\nCommittee of Education and Labor and on the Committee of Revision\r\nof the Laws, both obscure and unimportant.  In my second term\r\nI served a little while on the Committee on Elections.  I\r\nwas also placed on the Committee of Railroad and Canals.  I\r\nwas made Chairman of a special Committee to visit Louisiana\r\nand inquire into the legality of what was called the Kellogg\r\nGovernment and report whether Governor Kellogg or his Democratic\r\nrival should be recognized as the lawful Governor of Louisiana.\r\nI was afterward placed on the Judiciary Committee, a position\r\nof great honor, which I liked very much.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the last none of these appointments\r\nhad any attraction for me.  They were all out of the line\r\nof my previous experience in life and the service they required\r\nof me was disagreeable.  I was placed on the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary by Mr. Speaker Kerr, a Democrat.  Mr. Blaine\r\nat this time very earnestly pressed Mr. Martin I. Townsend\r\nof New York for the place.  I do not conceive that I had any\r\nright to complain of Mr. Blaine in this matter.  I never made\r\nany request of him for any appointment within his gift and\r\nhe was beset behind and before by the demands of men he was\r\nunable to gratify, to many of whom he conceived himself under\r\ngreat obligation.  It should be stated too that in Mr. Blaine's\r\ntime the Members from Massachusetts older in the service than\r\nmyself had very important places indeed.  So it was hardly\r\njust to increase the number of important Committee appointments\r\nfrom our State.\r\n\r\nBut it happened to me by great good fortune that I had an\r\nopportunity, of which I was very glad, to accomplish something\r\nby reason of my place on each Committee on which I served,\r\nwhich I could not have accomplished without it.\r\n\r\nAn amusing piece of good fortune happened to me at the beginning\r\nof my service.  I was placed, as I said, on the Committee\r\non the Revision of the Laws.  My law practice had been in\r\nthe interior of the Commonwealth.  So I had little knowledge\r\nof United States jurisprudence.  I determined in order to\r\nfit myself for my new duties to make a careful study of the\r\nstatutes and law administered in the United States Courts.\r\nI took with me to Washington a complete set of the Reports\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States and purchased Abbott's\r\nDigest of those decisions, then just published.  The first\r\nevening after I got settled I spent in reading the opinions\r\nof the Supreme Court.  I took the Digest beginning with the\r\nletter A, reading the abstracts, and then reading the cases\r\nreferred to.  I got as far as Adm and read the cases relating\r\nto admiralty practice.  The next morning the Speaker announced\r\nhis Committees and the House adjourned.  After the adjournment,\r\nJudge Poland, Chairman of the Committee on the Revision of\r\nthe Laws, called the Committee together and laid before them\r\na letter he had just received from Mr. Justice Miller of\r\nthe Supreme Court, asking for a change in the law in regard\r\nto monitions for summoning defendants in Admiralty.  The change\r\nhad been made necessary by some recent decisions of the Court.\r\nThe other members of the Committee looked at each other in\r\ndismay.  None of them was familiar with the question, or knew\r\nat all what it was all about.  I then stated to them the difficulty,\r\ngiving them the names of the cases and the volumes where they\r\nwere found.  They were all quite astonished to find a man\r\nfrom the country, of whom probably none of them had ever heard\r\nbefore, having the law of Admiralty at his tongue's end.\r\nIf the question had related to anything in the Digest under\r\nAdr, or anything thereafter, I should have been found probably\r\nmore ignorant than they were.  But Judge Poland took me into\r\nhigh favor, and I found his friendship exceedingly agreeable\r\nand valuable.  I do not remember that the Committee on the\r\nRevision of the Laws had another meeting while I belonged\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nI was also, as I have said, put on the Committee of Education\r\nand Labor.  The Bureau of Education had been lately established\r\nand the Commissioner appointed.  But the office was exceedingly\r\nunpopular, not only with the old Democrats and the Strict\r\nConstructionists, who insisted on leaving such things to the\r\nStates, but with a large class of Republicans.  A very zealous\r\nattack was made on the Bureau, led by Mr. Farnsworth of Illinois,\r\nand by Cadwallader C. Washburn, a very able and influential\r\nRepublican from Wisconsin.  The Committee on Appropriations,\r\nof which my colleague, Mr. Dawes, was Chairman, reported\r\na provision for abolishing this Bureau.  Mr. Dawes, himself,\r\nhowever, dissented.  The Republicans on the Committee of Education\r\nand Labor took up the cudgels for the Bureau.  We beat the\r\nCommittee of Appropriations.  The result of the strife was\r\nthat the Bureau was put on a firmer footing with a more liberal\r\nprovision, and it has since been, under General Eaton and\r\nDr. Harris, the accomplished and devoted Commissioners, of\r\nvery great and valuable service to the country.\r\n\r\nThat led me to give special study to the matter of National\r\neducation.  I introduced a bill for establishing an education\r\nsystem by National authority in States which failed to do\r\nit themselves.  Later, I introduced and carried through the\r\nHouse a measure for distributing the proceeds of the public\r\nland and sums received from patents and some other special\r\nfunds, among all the States in aid of the common schools.\r\nThis bill passed the House, but was lost in the Senate mainly\r\nbecause Senator Morrill of Vermont, a most excellent and influential\r\nstatesman, insisted that the money should go to the agricultural\r\ncolleges, in which he took great interest, and not to common\r\nschools.  Later when I became a member of the Senate I succeeded\r\nin getting a like measure twice through the Senate.  But it\r\nfailed in the House.  So the two Houses never agreed upon\r\nit.  But the movement and discussion aroused public attention\r\nthroughout the country and were of great value.\r\n\r\nWhile I was on that Committee, I think during my second term,\r\nthere was referred to it a bill to rebuild William and Mary\r\nCollege in Virginia.  The principal building of that College\r\nhad been destroyed by fire.  The Union and Rebel forces had\r\nfought for possession of it.  It had been held by the Union\r\nsoldiers and a court martial was sitting there when it was\r\nattacked by the other side and the Union men driven out, and\r\nthe insurgents held the building for a few hours.  They abandoned\r\nit very soon.  But before the Union soldiers had got back\r\nin force some stragglers set fire to the building.  It was\r\ntotally destroyed.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Mary was the oldest college in the country, except\r\nHarvard.  It numbered among its children many famous statesmen,\r\nincluding Jefferson, Marshall, Peyton Randolph, and Monroe.\r\nWashington was its Chancellor for twelve years.  Its graduates\r\nloved it ardently.  I came to the conclusion that it would\r\ntend very much to restore the old affectionate feeling between\r\nthe States to rebuild this College without inquiring too strictly\r\ninto the merits of the case, as tested by any strict principle\r\nof law.  I accordingly reported and advocated a bill for appropriating\r\nsixty or seventy thousand dollars to rebuild the College.\r\nAfterward, when on the Committee of Claims in the Senate,\r\nI advocated extending the same principle to all colleges,\r\nschools and other institutions of education and charity destroyed\r\nby the operations of the War without regard to the question\r\nwho was in fault.  This policy was, after a good deal of opposition\r\nand resistance, successfully carried out.\r\n\r\nBut the William and Mary College Bill was reported at the\r\ntime when the passions excited by the War were still burning\r\nin the breasts of many Republican statesmen.  The measure\r\nwas received with derision.  I was hardly allowed to go on\r\nwith my speech in order, and the ordinary courtesy of a brief\r\nextension of time to finish it was refused amid great clamor.\r\nBut I got the Bill through the House the next winter.  I had\r\na powerful ally in Mr. Perce of Mississippi, a Northern soldier,\r\nwho had settled in that State after the War.  It was not considered\r\nin the Senate.  The measure was renewed again later in the\r\nHouse.  But it was bitterly attacked by Mr. Reed of Maine,\r\nafterward Speaker, and defeated.  Afterward I succeeded in\r\ngetting it through the Senate when the Democrats had possession\r\nof the House, during the Administration of President Harrison,\r\nand it became a law.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by many Southern men that that measure,\r\nand the report and speech in which I advocated it, had a very\r\nstrong and wide influence in restoring good feeling toward\r\nthe Union in the minds of the people of Virginia.  Several\r\nof the graduates of William and Mary who afterward became\r\nRepublicans have assured me of this with great emphasis.  I\r\nwas much pleased to get the following letter from Governor\r\nHenry A. Wise, the eminent Virginia statesman, who was, with\r\ntwo or three exceptions, the most powerful and influential\r\nadvocate of secession in the South.\r\n\r\nRICHMOND VA\r\n  Feby 13th 1872.\r\nHON MR HOAR\r\nOF MASSTS.\r\n\r\n_Honored Sir._\r\n\r\nI write for no reason but one of pure feeling of respect--\r\nnot even for a reply.  I am a visitor of Wm and Mary College\r\n--truly of the most venerable of the \"Mothers of Thought\"\r\n--and have read your excellent appeal to the H. Reps: in\r\nher behalf.  It was worthy of that Grand old Comth, Massts,\r\nthe elder sister of this once glorious Comth, which hailed\r\nher heartily in the Night of Revolution against Tyrrany.\r\nIt was worthy of sweet memories--worthy of Letters--it was\r\npious and patriotic.  Let me just add a sentence more, to\r\nsay that if Rebellion and Sectional Hate are to be eradicated--\r\nand I hope they are--_that is the way to do it._  Your speech\r\n& the passage of such bills, catholic in every sense of love\r\n& charity, will do more to heal our Country's wounds than\r\nall the caustic of reconstruction which can be applied.\r\n\r\nWith unaffected gratitude for your Speech, I pray you will\r\nnot pause upon it, but keep the bill to its passage through\r\nboth Houses of Congress.  I know you would if you could see\r\nthe destitution of instruction, and the poverty which cant\r\npay for it, on the Consecrated peninsula of Jas Town, York\r\nTown, and Williamsburg.  Ah! tear down every parapet of War--\r\ncruel War, wanton war call it if you will--but for the Past,\r\nfor Piety's sake, for Learning and Moral's sake let Old Wm\r\n& Mary stand a Beacon Light for the guide of the Future.\r\n\r\n  Very sincerely\r\n  Yrs\r\n  HENRY A. WISE\r\n\r\nGovernor Wise had a very conspicuous career in the United\r\nStates House of Representatives.  He was a very zealous supporter\r\nof the Southern doctrine before the War.  He was regarded\r\nas a good deal of a fire eater.  He was Governor of Virginia\r\nwhen John Brown was executed.  But in spite of the horror\r\nand indignation that the people of the South felt for John\r\nBrown's raid he did full justice to the heroic quality of\r\nthe man.  He declared him \"the gamest man\" he ever saw.\r\n\r\nI served in my second term on the Committee on Elections under\r\nthe Chairmanship of George W. McCrary.  Election cases in\r\nthe House up to that time were, as they always were in the\r\nEnglish House of Commons and as they have been too often in\r\nthe Senate, determined entirely by party feeling.  Whenever\r\nthere was a plausible reason for making a contest the dominant\r\nparty in the House almost always awarded the seat to the man\r\nof its own side.  There is a well-authenticated story of Thaddeus\r\nStevens, that going into the room of the Committee of Elections,\r\nof which he was a member, he found a hearing going on.  He\r\nasked one of his Republican colleagues what was the point\r\nin the case.  \"There is not much point to it\" was the answer.\r\n\"They are both damned scoundrels.\" \"Well,\" said Stevens, \"which\r\nis the Republican damned scoundrel?  I want to go for the\r\nRepublican damned scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\nWe had a good many contests.  But the Committee determined\r\nto settle all the questions before it as they would if they\r\nwere judges in a court of justice.  The powerful influence\r\nof Mr. McCrary, the Chairman, aided largely to bring about\r\nthat result.  The Democratic minority soon discovered that\r\nwe were sincere and in earnest.  They met us in a like spirit.\r\nI believe the Committee on Elections during that Congress\r\nreported on every case with absolute impartiality, and the\r\nHouse followed their lead.  I formed a very pleasant friendship\r\non that Committee with Judge William M. Merrick, a Maryland\r\nDemocrat, who had made himself very much disliked by the Republican\r\nauthorities during the War because of his supposed sympathy\r\nwith Rebellion.  I do not think he sympathized with the Rebellion.\r\nBut he construed the Constitution very strictly and was opposed\r\nto many measures of the Administration.  He was nominated\r\nby President Cleveland to be Judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe District of Columbia.  The Judiciary Committee of the\r\nSenate reported against him, putting their objection on the\r\nground of the conduct imputed to him during the War, and also\r\nof his age.  He was then sixty-seven years old.  I dissented\r\nfrom the Committee, of which I was a member, and I exerted\r\nmyself with all my might to secure his confirmation, and was\r\nsuccessful.  He made a most admirable Judge, and my action\r\nwas abundantly vindicated by the result.\r\n\r\nI have taken special satisfaction in two reports which I\r\nmade for that Committee.  I have a right to say that I dealt\r\nwith the subjects with the same freedom from bias or prejudice\r\nwith which it would have been my duty to give to the question\r\nif I had been sitting on the Bench of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe case of Cessna _vs._ Myers was perhaps the most interesting\r\nand important of those in which I made a report for the Committee.\r\nJohn Cessna had served the State of Pennsylvania for several\r\nterms.  He was a very popular and eminent Republican member.\r\nAccording to the returns, Myers, his adversary, had a majority\r\nof 14.  Cessna showed beyond question, and his antagonist\r\nadmitted, that more than 14 illegal votes were cast for Myers.\r\nOn the other hand Myers claimed that there were many illegal\r\nvotes cast for Cessna, the evidence of which, so far as appeared,\r\ncame to his knowledge first when introduced in the case.  When\r\nthe evidence was taken Cessna claimed to have evidence that\r\n328 illegal votes were cast for Myers, and that ten legal\r\nvotes, cast or offered for him, were rejected.  On the other\r\nhand the sitting member claimed that there were 341 votes\r\nillegally thrown for the contestant, and of those Cessna admitted\r\nthat 81 had proved to be illegal.  So the Committee were obliged\r\nto examine by itself the evidence in regard to the right to\r\nvote of each of several hundred persons.\r\n\r\nThe case turned finally on some very interesting questions\r\nof the law of domicile.  It appeared that a considerable\r\nnumber of persons who were entitled to vote, if they were\r\nresident of the district where they voted, were workmen employed\r\nin the construction of a railroad.  They had come from outside\r\nthe district for that purpose alone, and had no purpose of\r\nremaining in the district after the railroad should be completed,\r\nand meant then to get work wherever they could find it, there\r\nor elsewhere.  There were also a number of votes cast by students\r\nwho had gone to college for the purpose of getting an education,\r\nhaving no design to remain there after their studies terminated.\r\nStill another class of voters whose right was in dispute,\r\nwere the paupers abiding in the public almshouse, and maintained\r\nin common by a considerable number of townships and parishes.\r\nThese paupers voted in the district where the almshouse was\r\nsituated, although it was not the district of their domicile or\r\nresidence when they were removed to it.\r\n\r\nThe Committee held in the case of the laborer,--in spite of\r\nthe very earnest contention to the contrary, that if the laborer\r\nelected in good faith when he came into the district to make\r\nit his legal residence, it became his legal residence, even\r\nif he intended to leave it and get another after his job was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWe applied a like doctrine to the case of the students, holding\r\nthat a student of a college, being personally present in any\r\ndistrict, had the right if he so desired, to take up his abode\r\nthere, and make it by his election his legal residence for\r\na fixed and limited time.\r\n\r\nThe question of the paupers we left undecided, as it turned\r\nout that whichever way it were decided, Mr. Cessna had not\r\novercome his opponent's legal majority.\r\n\r\nWe also decided an Arkansas case where the title to his seat\r\nof a well known Republican member of Congress was at stake,\r\nin favor of his Democratic contestant.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat gratified in the midst of a storm of vituperation\r\nwhich I had encountered for some political action of mine,\r\nin which I was charged by almost the entire Democratic press\r\nof the country with being a bitter partisan to find two Democratic\r\ngentlemen who had owed their seats to the impartiality of\r\nthe Committee on Elections, coming very zealously to the rescue.\r\n\r\nI served also from 1873 to 1875 on the Committee on Railroads\r\nand Canals.  I have no recollection of doing anything on that\r\nCommittee, except aiding in reporting a bill for the regulation\r\nby National authority of railroads engaged in interstate commerce,\r\nin defence of which I made a very elaborate speech.  But I\r\nwas able to secure the passage of one very interesting and\r\nimportant measure.  James B. Eads, the famous engineer, architect\r\nof the great St. Louis bridge, had a plan for opening to commerce\r\nthe mouth of the Mississippi River by a system of jetties.\r\nHe had submitted his plan to the Board of Engineers appointed\r\nby the War Department.  But he could get no encouragement,\r\nand of the twenty members of that Board, only one, General\r\nBarnard, the President, looked with any approval upon his\r\nscheme.  The Board thought that a very long and costly canal\r\nwas the only method of securing a water-way which would enable\r\nocean steamers to reach New Orleans, and the product of the\r\nMississippi valley to be carried to Europe that way.  Captain\r\nEads appeared before the Committee on Railroads and Canals\r\nand urged his scheme in a speech of great interest and ability.\r\nThe Committee adjourned for a week.  They were to take up\r\nthe question at the next meeting.  The vote was unanimous\r\nagainst Mr. Eads's Bill.  When the Committee came out of their\r\nroom he was waiting outside the door to learn his fate.  I\r\nsaw the look of disappointment and despair on his face when\r\nhe was told of the vote.  I asked him to come with me into\r\nanother room, which he did.  I told him that I was satisfied\r\nfrom what I had heard that his plan was a good one, although\r\nI had voted against it with the rest of the Committee.  It\r\nseemed to me that it would be presumptuous in me, having no\r\nspecial knowledge in such matters, to go against the practically\r\nunanimous report of the United States Board of Engineers.\r\nBut I said:  \"Captain Eads, can you not frame a bill, which\r\nwill provide that you shall not have any money from the Treasury\r\nfor your work until you have accomplished something.  If you\r\ndeepen the channel of the river a foot that will have done\r\nsome good.  Suppose you provide that when you have deepened\r\nthe river a certain number of feet you shall have so much\r\nof your pay, when it is deepened further so much more, and\r\nso on until the work is done.\"  Captain Eads eagerly caught\r\nat the plan.  He said that he was willing to do it, and that\r\nhe was perfectly willing that his getting his pay should depend\r\nupon the certificate of the engineers of his having accomplished\r\nthe result.  He agreed to have a bill drawn on that principle.\r\nHe brought it to me afterward.  I went over it very carefully,\r\ninserting some additional securities for the Government.\r\nI then took it to the next meeting of the Committee, moved a\r\nreconsideration of the vote of the previous week.  That was\r\ncarried by a bare majority of one vote.  I then moved the\r\nnew bill as a substitute for the old one.  It was adopted.\r\nThe bill passed the House and Senate under which the Eads\r\njetties were constructed and vessels drawing over twenty-\r\neight feet of water passed freely up and down to and from\r\nNew Orleans.  The depth before that time, I think, had been\r\ntwelve feet.  Captain Eads afterward sent me a beautifully\r\nbound copy of the history of the Eads's jetties with an inscription\r\ncertifying to the facts I have stated, in his own handwriting.\r\nI told this story afterward at a meeting of the business men\r\nof Boston.  Mr. Corthell who happened to be present made a\r\nspeech after I got through.  He is himself a very eminent\r\nwater engineer.  He said that he was associated with Captain\r\nEads at the time and had often heard Captain Eads tell the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nCaptain Eads afterward had a scheme which always seemed to\r\nme very feasible for a ship-railway across the Isthmus of\r\nTehuantepec.  His project was to construct a railway with\r\na sufficient number of tracks, and to raise ships of the largest\r\nsize on the principle applied in locks of ordinary canals.\r\nHe had a contrivance made of stout beams which would hold\r\nand support a loaded vessel to which it was adjusted.  The\r\nbeams were to operate something like the keys of a piano,\r\nand the whole operation was something like that by which hatters\r\nmeasure and record the shape of a man's head.  This plan received\r\nthe hearty commendation of some very eminent engineers, including\r\nMajor Reed of England, the highest authority of such subjects,\r\nthe constructor of the dry docks at Malta.  The scheme had\r\na good many supporters in Congress.  I think it would have\r\nbeen adopted but for Captain Eads's premature death.\r\n\r\nRather a singular coincidence took place when I was interesting\r\nmyself in this matter which possibly may be not too trivial\r\nto record.  One Thanksgiving morning I received by express\r\na beautiful copy of Wordsworth, which I had bought in Boston\r\nthe day before.  Just as I was opening it the morning mail\r\nwas brought in.  I opened the book at random and turned to\r\nWadsworth's poem, \"The Highland Broach.\" My eye caught the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  Lo!  Ships from seas by nature barred,\r\n  Mount along ways by man prepared;\r\n  Along far stretching vales, whose streams\r\n  Seek other seas, their canvas gleams,\r\n  And busy towns grow up on coasts\r\n  Thronged yesterday by airy ghosts.\r\n\r\nI turned by eye from these verses to the mail in which was\r\na copy of a New York illustrated journal containing an account\r\nof the Eads ship-railway.\r\n\r\nThe inscription in Eads's \"History of the Jetties,\" above\r\nreferred to, is as follows:\r\n\r\nTo Hon. George F. Hoar, who, as a member of the House Committee\r\nwhich matured the Jetty Act, prepared the _first report_ in\r\nits favor, this book is presented; with the assurance that\r\nhis unfaltering support of the enterprise through all its\r\nstruggles, entitled him to a prominent place among the statesmen\r\nto whom the producers in the Valley of the Mississippi are\r\nmost largely indebted.\r\n\r\n  JAS B. EADS\r\n  Washington, D. C.,\r\n  February\r\n  1881\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of receiving a telegram from New Orleans\r\nshortly after the completion of the jetties saying that a\r\nloaded steamer, drawing between twenty-seven and twenty-eight\r\nfeet of water, had safely passed through them to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe Commission appointed by the Government insisted upon having\r\nthe jetties constructed at the south pass of the Mississippi\r\nRiver.  This Captain Eads strenuously resisted and urged the\r\nsuperiority of the southwest pass for the purpose.  The House\r\nwhen it passed the jetty bill adopted Mr. Eads's plan.  But\r\nthe Senate insisted on taking the opinion of the Commission,\r\nmuch to his distress.  The Senate was firm, and the House\r\nwas obliged to yield.  I think everybody now agrees that Eads\r\nwas right, and that the scheme would have been perfectly successful,\r\nand would have continued to perform all that was desired of\r\nit, if his counsel had been taken.  As it is, the jetties\r\nhave been of great value and well worth their cost.  But it\r\nwill probably be necessary some time to construct a similar\r\nwork in the southwest pass.\r\n\r\nDuring my first term in the House on the Committee on Education\r\nand Labor I had the important duty of investigating the conduct\r\nof the Freedman's Bureau and other charges made against General\r\nOliver O. Howard.  I wrote nearly the whole of the report,\r\nall of it containing the arguments of the Committee, and the\r\nsumming up of the evidence.  A few passages are by the Chairman,\r\nMr. Arnell.  The Freedman's Bureau was established to aid\r\nthe colored people who had been suddenly emancipated by President\r\nLincoln's Proclamation, to attain a condition where they\r\ncould get their living in comfort, and their children could\r\nbe educated.  General Howard, a very eminent officer in the\r\nCivil War, afterward at the head of the Army, was a man singularly\r\nfitted for this duty.  He was profoundly religious, absolutely\r\nincorruptible, a man of very kind heart, not afraid to break\r\nout new paths, apt to succeed in all his undertakings, a lover\r\nof Liberty and thoroughly devoted to his work.  The resources\r\nat his command were the unclaimed pay of the negro soldiers\r\nand some other sums specially granted from the Treasury.  But\r\nthe work was one entirely different from anything which had\r\nbeen accomplished by government agency in the country before.\r\nHe purchased tracts of land, which were divided into building\r\nlots, which were sold to the colored people.  Money was advanced\r\nto them to build houses, the Freedman's Bureau taking a mortgage\r\nas security.  The Bureau endowed Howard University, of which\r\nGeneral Howard was made President.  A large Congregational\r\nChurch was built in Washington with moneys advanced by the\r\nBureau, the religious society giving its bonds at seven per\r\ncent. for which the structure was ample security.  General\r\nHoward had incurred the bitter animosity not only of the enemies\r\nof the negro race, who disliked the whole object for which\r\nthe Bureau was founded, but of other persons whom he had offended.\r\nI believe in no instance was there any loss to the Government,\r\nor to the fund in his charge.  He was able to establish in\r\ncomfortable homes, and to educate and to provide work for\r\nmany thousand freedmen who had flocked to Washington during\r\nthe disturbed period immediately following emancipation.  After\r\na thorough investigation, where the prosecution was conducted\r\nby Fernando Wood, a very distinguished and able Representative\r\nfrom New York, formerly Mayor of the City, General Howard\r\nwas completely exonerated by the report of the majority of\r\nthe Committee.  The report was accepted by the House.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 I visited Louisiana, as Chairman of a special committee\r\nraised for the purpose of inquiring into the conditions there,\r\nand ascertaining which of two rival State governments was\r\nthe lawful one.  The investigation disclosed a terrible story\r\nof murder, brutality and crime.  I made the report, signed\r\nalso by Mr. Wheeler, afterward Vice-President, and Mr. Frye,\r\nnow Senator and President pro tempore of the Senate.  It told\r\nthe dreadful story of these things with absolute truth and\r\nfidelity.  It is not worth while to revive these memories\r\nnow.  But at the same time I endeavored to do full justice\r\nto the better qualities of the Southern people and to explain\r\nhow it happened that men otherwise so honorable and brave\r\nand humane could be led by the passions of a political warfare\r\nand race prejudice to commit such offences.  Mr. Lamar, of\r\nMississippi, one of the most brilliant and able statesmen\r\nof his time, sought an interview with me after the report\r\nwent in and thanked me for what I had said of the Southern\r\npeople, and told me that \"I was the first Northern man who\r\nseemed to be capable of doing them justice.\" What he thought\r\nwill be found also stated by him.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made before a Democratic meeting in the spring\r\nof 1875, Mr. Lamar said (\"Life of Lamar,\" p. 221);\r\n\r\n\"Well, the character of that last Committee--especially of\r\nits Chairman, Mr. George F. Hoar--was such as to lead to no\r\nexpectation that there would be any indulgence shown to the\r\npeople of the South, or any very harsh criticisms of his own\r\nparty.  By inheritance, by training, by political association,\r\nhe was intensely anti-Southern.  His manners toward Southern\r\nmen, so bitter are his feelings, are often cold and reserved;\r\nand nothing but his instinct and refinement as a gentleman,\r\nwhich he is in every respect, saved him from sometimes being\r\nsupercilious; acute in intellect, cultured, trained to the\r\nhighest expression of his powers, quick in his resentments\r\nand combative in temperament, we certainly expected no quarter\r\nfrom his hands.  But beneath all this there were genuine truth\r\nand manhood in Hoar that lifted him above the sordid feeling\r\nof malignant passion.  He went, then, to that country, and\r\nhe made a report; and, while there is much in it that saddened\r\nmy heart, while there is much which I say is unwise and unjust\r\nin his observations, there are some things, fellow citizens,\r\nwhich you people of the North should hark to bear in mind,\r\nwhile you are coming to your conclusions with reference to\r\nthe relations which you intend to sustain to the prostrate\r\npeople of my section.  Here, fellow citizens, is what Mr.\r\nHoar says in reference to the South: 'We do not overlook the\r\ncauses which tended to excite deep feeling and discontent\r\nin the white population of Louisiana.  (I must read these\r\nextracts to you because a people's interest, a people's destiny,\r\nhang largely upon the action of the people of New Hampshire\r\nand other Northern States.)  There has been great maladministration;\r\npublic funds have been wasted (that means public funds have\r\nbeen embezzled, appropriated by these governments that are\r\nsucking the blood, the life blood, from a people already impoverished\r\nby four years of calamitous war); public lands have been wasted,\r\npublic credit impaired.' Now, fellow citizens, that is the\r\ntestimony of one of the most uncompromising Republicans in\r\nthis country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lamar would not have used, I am sure, the word \"bitter\"\r\nafter we came to know each other better.  Perhaps I may be\r\nforgiven if I insert here a letter from Mr. Lamar's nephew,\r\njust elected a member of Congress from the State of Florida.\r\nI know I must attribute the eulogy which it contains to his\r\nkindness of heart, and desire to meet more than half way my\r\nown cordial feeling toward the portion of my countrymen to\r\nwhom he belongs.  I do not take them literally.  But I confess\r\nI like to leave on record, if I may, some evidence which will\r\ncontradict the charge so constantly made by critics near home,\r\nthat I am a man of intense partisan and personal bitterness.\r\n\r\nTALLAHASSEE, FLA.,\r\n  Mch 10th, 1903\r\n\r\nSENATOR GEORGE F. HOAR,\r\n  Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\nI would like very much to have a copy of your address lately\r\nmade before the Union League of Chicago.  I see notices of\r\nthe speech in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nAlso your address made before the New England Society some\r\nthree years ago, if you have a copy.\r\n\r\nYour picture, sent to me at my request, hangs in my room.\r\nIt is the face and form of a great American statesman.  One\r\nwhom our people have learned to admire and love.\r\n\r\nOur people venerate your years, still in vigorous life and\r\nin full possession of great faculties of mind and heart.\r\nWe look to you and other great Northern men to keep us in\r\nour sectional and racial questions.  In one way these questions\r\nmean so little to the sections of the country not immediately\r\ninterested in them, but they mean so much to the Southern\r\npeople who have to deal with them as live, every day matters.\r\n\r\nI left the Attorney-General's office in this State on February\r\n28th, ult., after fourteen years service and two years yet\r\nto run.  On March 4th, inst., I became Congressman from the\r\nnew Third Congressional district.\r\n\r\nI go to Washington as a Democrat, but with full knowledge\r\nthat my party does not contain all the right or all the wrong\r\nin it.  And I hope that in the vexing questions of the future,\r\nthat by a temperate course of thought and action, that my\r\ninfluence may be worth something, however small, to my people\r\nbeyond even a party view.\r\n\r\nBut after all I feel that great and representative men of\r\nother sections can assist the Southern people in these questions\r\nquite as much, if not more, than we can assist ourselves.\r\n\r\nI hope to meet you next winter.  The biography of my Uncle\r\nJustice Lamar shows how much he esteemed you and your regard\r\nfor him.  I am with much respect,\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n  (Signed) W. B. LAMAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was also placed by Mr. Blaine on the Committee to investigate\r\nthe Union Pacific Railroad and the Credit Mobilier.  I shall\r\ngive an account of this matter in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nThere was great public excitement on the subject.  After\r\nthe report on the Union Pacific Railroad, and within about\r\na week of the end of Congress, the House adopted a resolution\r\nto make a like investigation of the affairs of the Central\r\nPacific Railroad.  It was absolutely impossible to accomplish\r\nsuch an inquiry within the few remaining days of the session.\r\nBut if we failed to attempt it the political newspapers and\r\nwhat are called Independent newspapers, always much less fair\r\nto public men than political opponents, would have charged\r\nus with failing to make the investigation from a desire to\r\nscreen the offenders.  The charge would have been greedily\r\nbelieved in the excited condition of the public mind, which\r\nour explanation would never reach.  So I advised the Committee\r\nto call Mr. Huntington, the President of the Central Pacific\r\nRailroad, and ask him to produce the accounts and records\r\nof his Company.  To this it was anticipated that he would\r\nreply that these records were in California and that he could\r\nnot get them before Congress and the authority of the Committee\r\nwould expire.  Mr. Huntington was accordingly summoned.  He\r\nbrought with him Mr. William M. Evarts, as counsel, and\r\ntestified as was expected.  He then, however, asked leave\r\nof the Committee to make a statement in regard to the relation\r\nof his road to the National Government.  This was granted.\r\nHe then went on to say what a great public benefactor his\r\ncompany had been.  It had connected the two oceans by a great\r\nrailroad across the continent, saving millions upon millions\r\nto the commerce of the country.  But beside that he said it\r\nhad saved to the Government more than all the moneys the Government\r\nhad advanced toward its construction, by preventing Indian\r\nwars.  One winter especially his railroad corporation had\r\nfed a hostile Indian tribe when the Government supplies had\r\nfailed to reach them, saving them from the danger of starvation\r\nand saving the Government from a bloody and costly Indian\r\nwar.  I said, Mr. Huntington--Was not that ultra vires for\r\na railroad corporation?  He answered, \"No, Sir! no, Sir! we\r\nnever gave them anything as strong as that.\" He evidently\r\nthought he was being charged with supplying the Indians with\r\nliquor, and that ultra vires meant extra strength.\r\n\r\nThe only other important committee work that I now recall\r\nduring my service in the House related to the investigation\r\nof the conduct of Mr. Speaker Blaine.  He was charged with\r\nhaving received stock in a railroad at a price much less than\r\nits then value with the expectation of paying for it by aiding\r\nthe passage of legislation in which the road was interested,\r\nby political service as a Member of the House of Representatives,\r\nand especially by his great influence as Speaker.  It was\r\nfurther claimed that in letters addressed by him to a man\r\nnamed Mulligan he had demanded conveyances of such stock in\r\ncompensation for a ruling he had before made by which a measure\r\nin conflict with the interest of the road was defeated.  These\r\ncharges were referred to the Committee of the Judiciary.  The\r\nHouse was then Democratic and the majority of the Committee\r\nwas made up of Mr. Blaine's political opponents.  The investigation\r\nwas conducted in a spirit of bitter hostility to him.  The\r\nevidence was taken by a sub-committee of which I was not\r\na member.  But as disputed questions of procedure and as\r\nto the admission of evidence were constantly coming up which\r\nwere referred always to the full committee, which was considered\r\nin session all the time for that purpose,--the members were\r\nevery day, sometimes several times a day, summoned from their\r\nseats in the House to the meeting of the Committee.  I was\r\nfamiliar with the whole case as it went in.  It was expected\r\nthat there would be a hostile report, and it was understood\r\nthat I should be charged with the duty of making a minority\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nI studied that evidence as thoroughly and faithfully as I\r\ncould.  I have gone over the matter very carefully since.\r\nI was then satisfied, and am satisfied now, that the charges\r\nagainst Mr. Blaine of any corruption or wrong-doing were\r\ntotally unsustained.  They would never have found credit\r\nfor a moment except in minds deeply excited by the bitter\r\npolitical passion which at that time raged to a degree wholly\r\nunknown in our political strife to-day.  All Mr. Blaine did\r\nwas to say when he applied for the purchase of the stock to\r\nthe men who were then trying to dispose of it that \"he should\r\nnot be a dead-head.\"  He meant by that only that he was able\r\nto be of advantage to any undertaking in which he should be\r\ninterested, an assurance which his known ability and energy\r\nand large acquaintance with business men thoroughly warranted\r\nhim in making.  There was no action of Congress expected,\r\nor legislation in which the railroad was likely to have an\r\ninterest.  All that it expected to get from Congress had been\r\nobtained already.\r\n\r\nThe other charge that he demanded a favor in this purchase\r\nas compensation for a ruling he had made as Speaker was, in\r\nmy judgment, equally unfounded and trivial.  He simply alluded\r\nto the fact that he had made a ruling which had saved the\r\nroad from hostile legislation.  Every lawyer had doubtless\r\nmany times had jurymen remind him of the fact that they had\r\nbeen on juries that gave verdicts in his favor.  Every Member\r\nof Congress likes to meet a pensioner for whom he has secured\r\na pension.  Neither has any thought of wrong in reviving such\r\na memory.  The ruling Mr. Blaine had made was simply stating\r\na clear rule of the House about which there could be no doubt\r\nwhatever.  At the same time, I said at the time, what I deem\r\nit my duty to repeat now, I think Mr. Blaine erred, when\r\nhe thought it proper to embark in such a speculative investment.\r\nMembers of legislative bodies, especially great political leaders\r\nof large influence, ought to be careful to keep a thousand\r\nmiles off from relations which may give rise to even a suspicion\r\nof wrong.  Their influence and character are the property\r\nof their country, and especially valuable to their political\r\nassociates.  The great doctrines of which they are the influential\r\nadvocates must not be imperiled by any smell of fire on their\r\ngarments.  But an error of judgment, or of good taste, on\r\ntheir part, is very far from being corruption.  Henry Clay\r\nwas a gambler.  Other eminent statesmen both in this country\r\nand in Europe have made no secret of even worse vices than\r\nthat.  They are undoubtedly to be disapproved, in some cases\r\nseverely condemned.  But the people always have made and always\r\nwill make a distinction between such offences and the final\r\nunpardonable guilt of corruption in office.\r\n\r\nJames G. Blaine was a man of many faults and many infirmities.\r\nBut his life is a part of the history of his country.  It\r\nwill be better for his reputation that the chapter of that\r\nhistory which relates to him shall be written by a historian\r\nwith a full and clear sense of those faults and infirmities,\r\nconcealing nothing, and extenuating nothing.  But also let\r\nhim set nought down in malice.  Mr. Blaine was a brilliant\r\nand able man, lovable, patriotic, far-seeing, kind.  He acted\r\nin a great way under great responsibilities.  He was wise\r\nand prudent when wisdom and prudence were demanded.  If he\r\nhad attained to the supreme object of his ambition and reached\r\nthe goal of the Presidency, if his life had been spared to\r\ncomplete his term, it would have been a most honorable period,\r\nin my opinion, in the history of the country.  No man has\r\nlived in this country since Daniel Webster died, save McKinley\r\nalone, who had so large a number of devoted friends and admirers\r\nin all parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nSALMON P. CHASE\r\n\r\nAmong the very interesting characters with whom I have formed\r\nan acquaintance in Washington was Chief Justice Salmon P.\r\nChase.  I saw him but a few times.  But on those occasions\r\nhe spoke to me with a freedom with which famous public men\r\nseldom speak, even to intimate friends.  I incline to think\r\nit was his habit to speak freely to comparative strangers.\r\nBut of that I know nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen I first went to Washington, in the spring of 1869, I\r\nwas invited by Commissary-General Eaton, whose daughter was\r\nthe wife of my cousin, to attend a meeting of a club at his\r\nhouse.  The club was composed of scientific men who met at\r\neach other's houses.  The reading of a paper by the host was\r\nfollowed by a supper.  The host was permitted to invite such\r\nguests as he saw fit, not members of the club.  Chief Justice\r\nChase was one of the guests.  I was introduced to him there\r\nfor the first time, except that I went, when I was quite a\r\nyoung man, long before the war, to hear him speak and, with\r\na great many other persons, went up and shook hands with him\r\nafter the speech was over.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice left General Eaton's house when I did,\r\nand asked me if I were going his way.  So we walked together\r\nabout a mile.  He talked all the way about the next nomination\r\nfor the Presidency; about the prospects of the various candidates,\r\nand the probability of the success of the Democratic Party\r\nif they had a candidate who would be satisfactory to the Republicans\r\nwho were disaffected with the present policies.  It was evident\r\nthat his great man had this subject, to use a cant phrase,\r\n\"on the brain.\"  This was before the Chief Justice had his\r\nparalytic shock.  He was in the full vigor of health, a model\r\nof manly strength and manly beauty, giving every evidence\r\nthat his great intellectual power was undiminished.\r\n\r\nNot long afterward a friend of mine went to Ohio with his\r\nwife.  In those days it was necessary for persons going from\r\nWashington to the Northwest to cross Baltimore in a carriage--\r\nthe Washington station and the Ohio station being in different\r\nparts of the city.  A friend of my friend went to Baltimore\r\nto see his wife, who was going to Ohio, across the city and\r\nthen to return to Washington.  He knew Chief Justice Chase.\r\nHe introduced him to my friend on the cars, and they rode\r\nacross Baltimore in one carriage, the two gentlemen, the Chief\r\nJustice, and the wife.  The Chief Justice talked to him whom\r\nhe had just met for the first time during the whole ride of\r\nhalf an hour on the same engrossing subject, as he had to\r\nme before.\r\n\r\nI think there can be no doubt that Chief Justice Chase, like\r\nmany other great men, was consumed by an eager and passionate\r\nambition for the Presidency.  That has been true of other\r\ngreat statesmen as well as of many small statesmen.  It has\r\nbeen specially true of great orators.  The American people\r\nare fond of eloquent speech.  They make their admiration known\r\nto the speaker in a way that is quite likely to turn his head.\r\nIn Plato's day the bee Hymettus mingled with the discourse\r\nas it came forth.  To-day the bee lights in his ear and fills\r\nhis fancy with delightful dreams of a hive by the Potomac,\r\nthatched with flowers and redolent with the incense of flattery.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that if Salmon P. Chase had been elected President\r\nof the United States he would have administered that lofty\r\noffice honorably and to the advantage of the country.  But\r\nI think that his ambition clouded his judgment, and inclined\r\nhim, perhaps unconsciously, to take an attitude as a Judge\r\non some of the political questions on which parties were divided\r\nafter President Grant came in, which would be acceptable to\r\nthe Democrats, and would make it possible for him to accept\r\ntheir nomination.  But all this is merest speculation.  If\r\nhe had maintained his mental and physical vigor it is quite\r\nlikely that he would have been nominated when Greeley was\r\nnominated.  If he had been, it is not unlikely, in my opinion,\r\nthat he would have been elected.  I thought at the time that\r\nif Mr. Adams had been nominated in 1872, he might have been\r\nchosen.  The discontent with Grant was far-reaching, for the\r\nreasons I have stated elsewhere.  But the nomination of Greeley\r\nwas ludicrous and preposterous.  Almost every attack on the\r\nfirst Administration of President Grant was answered by the\r\npolitical speakers on his side by a quotation from Greeley\r\nor the New York _Tribune._ A candidate seeking an election\r\nby reason of the mistakes his antagonist has made in accordance\r\nwith his own advice, does not stand much chance of winning.\r\nThe Southern people, even the white Democrats, always had\r\na kindly feeling for Grant.  They did not resent what he had\r\ndone as a soldier, as they resented what Greeley had said\r\nas a politician.  They knew too, in spite of their strong\r\ndifferences with Grant, the innate honesty, justice and courage\r\nof the man.\r\n\r\nChase would have been a far stronger candidate than Greeley.\r\nHowever any political antagonist might dislike him, every\r\nantagonist must respect him, and nobody could laugh at him.\r\n\r\nThe question of the constitutional power of Congress to make\r\nTreasury notes legal tender for all debts, whether incurred\r\nbefore or after they were issued, came up for the decision\r\nof the Court when Chase was Chief Justice.  It was a question\r\nwhich profoundly interested and excited the public.  The Democratic\r\nParty, which more lately favored the payment of all debts,\r\npublic and private, in irredeemable paper money, had assailed\r\nthe Republican Administration during the war for providing,\r\nunder an alleged necessity that Treasury notes, called greenbacks,\r\nshould be legal tender for the discharge of all debts.  The\r\nconstitutionality of that law had been affirmed by the courts\r\nof fifteen States.  It had been denied by one court only,\r\nthat of Kentucky, the eminent Chancellor dissenting.  There\r\nwas scarcely a Republican lawyer or a Republican judge in\r\nthe country who doubted the constitutional power of Congress\r\nto impose such a quality upon the paper currency if, in the\r\nopinion of Congress, the public safety should require it.\r\n\r\nThe question came before the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nin the case of Hepburn _v._ Griswold, and was decided by that\r\nCourt in December, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe Court were all agreed that Congress has power under the\r\nConstitution to do not only what the Constitution expressly\r\nauthorizes, but to adopt any means appropriate, and plainly\r\nadapted to carry in to effect any such express power.  So\r\nthe two questions arose:  First, Was the power to issue legal\r\ntender notes an appropriate, and plainly adapted means to\r\nany end which the National Government has a right to accomplish?\r\nSecond, Who are to judge of the question whether the means\r\nbe so appropriate, or plainly adapted?\r\n\r\nThere were then seven Justices of the Supreme Court.  Chief\r\nJustice Chase, with the three Democratic Justices held the\r\nLegal Tender Law unconstitutional, and declared that a law\r\nmaking anything but gold or silver legal tender for debts\r\nwas neither appropriate nor plainly adapted to carrying on\r\nwar, or any other end for which the National Government was\r\nerected.\r\n\r\nHe had, when Secretary of the Treasury during the War of the\r\nRebellion, originally advised the issuing of these legal\r\ntender notes.  He had visited the Capitol.  He had called\r\nmembers of the two Houses of Congress from their seats and,\r\nby his great urgency, overcome their reluctance to vote for\r\nthe Legal Tender Law.  My late colleague, Mr. Dawes, has more\r\nthan once told me, and others in my hearing, that he was exceedingly\r\nreluctant to resort to that measure, and that he was induced\r\nto support it by Mr. Chase's earnest declaration that it was\r\nimpossible that the War should go on without it, that he was\r\nat the last extremity of his resources.  A Government note\r\nhad been formally protested in the city of New York.  I have\r\nheard a like statement from many public men, survivors of\r\nthat time.  It is not too much to say, that without Mr. Chase's\r\nurgent and emphatic affirmation that the war must stop and\r\nthe Treasury be bankrupt and the soldiers without their pay,\r\nunless this measure were adopted, it never could have passed\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, Mr. Chase puts his opinion in the Legal\r\nTender Cases on the ground that this was not a necessary,\r\nor plainly adapted means to the execution of the unquestionable\r\npower of carrying on a great war in which the life of the\r\nRepublic was in issue.\r\n\r\nThe question whether this necessity existed was a question\r\nof fact.  Now questions of fact cannot be determined by the\r\ncourts.  If the fact be one on which depends the propriety\r\nof legislation it must be determined by the law-making power.\r\nOf course, where facts are of such universal or general knowledge\r\nthat the court can know them judicially, without proof, like\r\nthe fact of the time of the rising of the sun, or the laws\r\nof mechanics, or the customs prevailing in great branches\r\nof business, the court may take judicial notice of them.  But\r\nhow could Mr. Chase, as a judge, judicially declare as a fact\r\nthat the issue of legal tender notes was not necessary for\r\ncarrying on the war, when he had, as Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nhaving better means of knowledge than any other man, so earnestly\r\nand emphatically declared such necessity? How could he, as\r\na judge of one court, determine as of an unquestionable fact\r\nof universal knowledge that the issue of a legal tender note\r\nwas not necessary for maintaining the Government in that\r\nterrible war, when fourteen State tribunals, and a minority\r\nof his own court, had declared the fact to be the other way?\r\n\r\nThis decision gave rise to an attack upon the Administration\r\nof President Grant and especially upon Judge Hoar, then Attorney-\r\nGeneral, which, although it has no foundation whatever in\r\nfact, is occasionally revived in later years, that the Court\r\nwas packed by appointing two new Judges to reverse the decision.\r\nThe decision in Hepburn _v._ Griswold was announced in the\r\nSupreme Court February 7, 1870.  The court met at twelve o'clock.\r\nThe decision was read by the Chief Justice after several opinions\r\nhad been read by other judges, so that the afternoon must\r\nhave advanced considerably before it was promulgated.  It\r\nhad not been made known to the public in advance by the press,\r\nand President Grant and Attorney-General Hoar both affirmed\r\nthat they had no knowledge of the decision and had no expectation\r\nof what it would be before it was announced.  I myself had\r\na conversation with Attorney-General Hoar in the afternoon\r\nof that day.  He had just heard the decision from the Chief\r\nJustice with great astonishment and surprise.\r\n\r\nFour judges concurred in the decision.  There were two vacancies\r\nin the court--one occasioned by the withdrawal of Mr. Justice\r\nGrier, and one by the Act of Congress of the previous Session\r\nproviding for an additional judge.  At twelve o'clock in the\r\nmorning of that day, before the decision in Hepburn _v._ Griswold\r\nwas made known, President Grant had sent to the Senate, and\r\nthe Senate had received the communication nominating Messrs.\r\nStrong and Bradley to these vacancies.  They were regarded\r\nas the ablest lawyers in the circuits where they dwelt.  By\r\ncommon consent of the entire profession they are among the\r\nablest judges who ever sat on the Supreme Bench.  In my opinion\r\nMr. Justice Bradley has had no superior, save Marshall alone,\r\non that court, in every quality of a great judge.  I doubt\r\nif he has had, on the whole, an equal, save Marshall alone.\r\nThey have both joined in opinions since their appointment\r\nin very important political questions, in which the policy\r\nof the party to which they belonged was not sustained.  An\r\noffer to them of these vacancies in their circuits was the\r\nmost natural and proper thing that could have been done.\r\nThere was no Republican lawyer in the country, of any considerable\r\nprominence, so far as I know, who questioned the constitutionality\r\nof the Legal Tender Act, of distinction enough to make him\r\nthought of anywhere for a place on the Supreme Bench.  So\r\nfar as I now remember, there is but one instance of an appointment\r\nby the President of the United States to the Supreme Court\r\nof a man not belonging to his own political party.  That is\r\nthe case of Mr. Justice Jackson, who was appointed by President\r\nHarrison on my own earnest recommendation.  There has never\r\nbeen made in any quarter, so far as I know, a statement or\r\npretence that there existed any evidence that President Grant\r\nmade these appointments, or that any member of his Cabinet\r\nadvised it because of its possible effect on the Legal Tender\r\nLaw.  Yet this foolish and dirty charge has found extensive\r\ncredit.  I read it once in the London _Times._  It was, however,\r\nin a communication written by a degenerate and recreant American\r\nwho was engaged in reviling his own country.  It was also\r\nreferred to by Mr. Bryan in his book on the United States.\r\nI sent him a copy of a pamphlet I prepared on the subject,\r\nand received from him a letter expressing his satisfaction\r\nthat the story was without foundation.  It is the fashion\r\nstill, in some quarters, to speak, in spite of the decisions\r\nof the Supreme Court and the numerous State courts, to which\r\nI have referred, as if it were too clear for argument that\r\nCongress had no right to make the Government notes a legal\r\ntender.  The gentlemen who talk in that way, however, are\r\nalmost universally men of letters, or men without any legal\r\ntraining or any considerable legal capacity.  They are of\r\nthat class of political philosophers who are never trusted\r\nby their countrymen to deal with authority with any practical\r\nquestion either legislative, administrative, or judicial.\r\n\r\nWhile saying this, I wish to affirm my own belief that, while\r\nit may be in some great emergencies like that of our late\r\nCivil War essential to the maintenance of the Government\r\nthat this power which I believe Congress has, without a shadow\r\nof a reasonable question, should be exercised, yet I should\r\nhold it a great calamity if it were exercised except on such\r\nan occasion.  It is a dangerous power, like the power of suspending\r\nthe writ of _Habeas corpus,_ or the power of declaring war,\r\nor the power of reckless and extravagant public expenditure,\r\nnever to be exercised if it can possibly be helped.  I think\r\nthe American people have, in general, settled down on this\r\nas the reasonable view, in spite of the clamor of the advocates\r\nof fiat money on the one side, and the extreme strict constructionists\r\non the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nADIN THAYER\r\n\r\nThe political history of Massachusetts from 1850 until 1888\r\ncannot be written or understood without a knowledge of the\r\nremarkable career of Adin Thayer.  When I was first nominated\r\nfor Congress, he was my earnest opponent.  That was due, so\r\nfar as I know, to no dislike to me, but only to his strong\r\nfriendship for Mr. Bird.  After my election, he became my\r\nstanch friend.  Our friendship continued without interruption\r\nto his death.  The name of Adin Thayer is dear to my memory\r\nand to my heart.\r\n\r\nI have often said that there were four men who honored me\r\nwith their friendship, whose counsel I liked to get under\r\nany difficult public responsibility, and that when these four\r\nmen approved or agreed with anything I myself said or did,\r\nI did not care what the rest of mankind thought.  It would\r\nhave been better to say that, although I did care very much\r\nwhat the rest of mankind thought, I knew that when these\r\nmen were on my side, the wisdom and conscience of Massachusetts\r\nwould be there also.\r\n\r\nOne of them was John G. Whittier.  He added to the great genius\r\nwhich made him a famous poet the quality of being one of the\r\nwisest and most discreet political advisers and leaders who\r\never dwelt in the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAnother was my own brother, Judge Hoar, of whom I will not\r\nnow undertake to speak.  He was the last friend of mine who\r\nalways performed the act of friendship to which Adin Thayer\r\nwas never unequal, that of telling me my faults and mistakes\r\nwith much more thoroughness and plainness of speech than he\r\never used in praising any of my virtues.\r\n\r\nThe third was Samuel May, who died in an honored old age at\r\nLeicester, his sunset hour cheered by the memories of noble\r\nservice and the consciousness of having borne his full share\r\nin the greatest achievement of human history accomplished\r\nby mere political instrumentalities--the freedom of the slave.\r\n\r\nThe fourth was Adin Thayer, a man quite as remarkable in his\r\nway as either of the others in his.  Each of them gave high\r\nand brave counsel in great emergencies.  Each of them had\r\na great part in the overthrow of the political forces that\r\nwere on the side of slavery, and in the triumphant overthrow\r\nof the combination which would, if successful, have corrupted\r\nMassachusetts and made of her the worst instead of the best\r\nexample on earth of republican self-government.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly room here for more than a sketch of Adin\r\nThayer.  He was a very striking, original and picturesque\r\nfigure in the history of the Commonwealth.  He was a strong,\r\nbrave, wise, unselfish man.  His life, so far as he took part\r\nin political affairs, was devoted to objects wholly public,\r\nnever personal.  He was the greatest organizer of righteousness\r\nin his generation.  We must go back to Sam Adams to find any\r\none who deserves to be compared with him in this respect.\r\nI cannot now undertake to tell the story of his important\r\nservices to the Commonwealth at some very critical periods,\r\nor to narrate the history of all the political events in which\r\nhe bore so conspicuous a share.  The time to do this has not\r\ncome.  It can be done only when the correspondence, the inner\r\npersonal life of men who were the leaders of Massachusetts\r\nduring the stormy period through which she has lately passed,\r\nshall be given to the world.\r\n\r\nWorcester County, from the day of Rufus Putnam until to-day,\r\nhas in every generation contributed eminent persons to the\r\nservice of the Commonwealth.  But the service of none of them\r\nhas been in the same field as his.  Indeed, as I have just\r\nsaid, we must go back to the days of the Revolution to find\r\na conspicuous character who united so completely absolute\r\ndisinterestedness of character, inflexible integrity, passionate\r\nlove for Massachusetts, devotion to the loftiest ideals, and\r\nwas at the same time a most skilful and efficient organizer\r\nof political forces.\r\n\r\nAdin Thayer was born in the town of Mendon, in the County\r\nof Worcester, December 5, 1828.  His birthplace was near Chestnut\r\nHill, in the territory which was incorporated into the town\r\nof Blackstone in 1845.  He was the son of Caleb Thayer and\r\nHannah, the daughter of Peter Gaskill of Mendon.  His ancestors,\r\nso far as known, in all the line of descent, were New England\r\nfarmers.  No better race ever existed for the development\r\nof the highest intellectual and moral quality.  They wrung\r\na difficult livelihood from the soil and forest.  They were\r\neducated by the responsibilities of self-government.  They\r\nwere accustomed to meditate and discuss with each other the\r\nprofoundest questions of theology and of the State.  Their\r\nlocal traditions had made them familiar with a stimulant and\r\nheroic history, in which every family had borne its share.\r\nIn these Puritan communities life was a perpetual gymnasium.\r\nAt the time of Mr. Thayer's birth, the strictness of the\r\nPuritan manners had softened somewhat.  A milder theology\r\nwas slowly making its way, but the race which settled in New\r\nEngland still remained without a tincture of any foreign element.\r\n\r\nThe town was one of the oldest in Worcester County.  In every\r\ngeneration it had contained men of large influence in the\r\nCommonwealth, who had kept alive the interest of the people\r\nin public affairs.  Jonathan Russell, who, with Adams, Bayard,\r\nClay and Gallatin, negotiated the treaty of Ghent, and who\r\nmet rather an ignominious defeat afterward in an attempt to\r\nmeasure lances with John Quincy Adams; the Hastings family,\r\nthree of whom were eminent lawyers, two of them having represented\r\nthe district in Congress; were of a generation that passed\r\nfrom the stage at about the time of Judge Thayer's birth.\r\n\r\nThe people were fond of discussing public questions, not\r\nonly in town meeting, but in neighborhood gatherings and\r\ndebating societies.  The Judge used often to tell of the\r\neager interest with which in his boyhood he listened to these\r\nencounters.  There were two men, one of whom survived until\r\nJudge Thayer came to manhood, the other of whom died recently\r\nin an honored old age, who were less known abroad than those\r\nI have named, but who exerted a powerful influence upon the\r\ncommunity and upon the character of the observant and impressible\r\nboy.  One of them was Dan Hill, the other the Reverend Adin\r\nBallou.\r\n\r\nDan Hill was one of the most remarkable men Worcester County\r\never contained.  He was not bred to the bar, and was without\r\nthe advantage of what is called a liberal education.  But\r\nhe had a wonderful aptness for understanding legal principles\r\nand the weight and effect of evidence.  His neighbors when\r\nin trouble instinctively sought him as a shield.  He was an\r\nunerring counsellor in the conduct of complicated affairs.\r\nHis aid was extensively sought in the preparation of causes,\r\nin settling estates, and as guardian and trustee.  He was\r\nconcerned in hundreds of cases.  It would be hard to name\r\none in which he had anything to do that did not terminate\r\nto the advantage of the party who employed him.  He had none\r\nof the arts of the pettifogger.  He cared little for his own\r\npersonal advantage.  He had a native and lofty scorn for dishonesty\r\nand meanness.  He was never better pleased than when, without\r\nprospect of gain for himself, he was employing his talents\r\nin the protection of poor and honest men against fraud and\r\noppression.  He had a large public spirit.  He was early an\r\nanti-slavery man, and one of the founders of the Free Soil\r\nParty.  He was specially at home in the Mendon and Blackstone\r\ntown meetings, in the meetings of the school district, in the\r\ncaucus, in the temperance and anti-slavery meetings and other\r\nneighborhood gatherings where the people discussed matters\r\nwhich concerned the public welfare.  In all these he gave\r\nsensible counsel in common affairs and high counsel in high\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Adin Ballou, of whom Judge Thayer delighted\r\nto speak in his later years, may be traced in the strong sympathy\r\nthe Judge always showed for aspirations, although exhibited\r\nin the most crude and grotesque fashion, for the reconstruction\r\nof society according to the laws of a newer and more spiritual\r\nlife.  Mr. Ballou, a man of clear intellect, stainless life,\r\nsweet and amiable temper, undertook with about thirty companions\r\nand disciples to form a community which should have the Beatitudes\r\nfor constitution, charter and by-laws.  This community was\r\nestablished at Hopedale, now a separate town, then part of\r\nMilford, formerly part of Mendon.  Some of the most important\r\nmembers of this body withdrew from it, doubting its ability to\r\nmaintain itself financially, and it was abandoned.  But if\r\nits sweet and gracious influence on the social life in its\r\nneighborhood be any measure of its success, it was highly\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nHopedale became famous afterward as the dwelling-place of\r\nGeorge Draper, one of the most eminent manufacturers and sagacious\r\nand public-spirited citizens--founder of the Home Market Club--\r\nthe reputation and honor of whose name has been still more\r\nextended by his sons, the eldest of whom is the admirable\r\nsoldier, Representative to Congress and Minister to Italy,\r\nGeneral William F. Draper.\r\n\r\nJudge Thayer was named for Adin Ballou, although he afterward\r\ndropped the middle name.  Mr. Ballou gives his estimate of\r\nhis namesake in the following letter:\r\n\r\nHOPEDALE, MASS., Aug. 20, 1888.\r\n  HON. GEORGE F. HOAR,--\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir,_--\r\n\r\nYour lines of 11th inst. were duly received.  I am very glad\r\nto learn that a Biography of Hon. Adin Thayer is in process\r\nof preparation, and that the work is in such competent hands.\r\nI reckoned him among my highly esteemed personal friends,\r\nand was painfully shocked by the news of his lamentable death.\r\nI knew his grandfather before him, his father and mother,\r\nand the whole family connexion more or less intimately.  They\r\nwere often attendant on my public ministrations, and I have\r\nbeen with them, during my long life, on many occasions of\r\ninterest, joy and sorrow.  They have all been persons of strong\r\ncommon sense, downright honesty and solid worth.  Judge Thayer\r\ndescended from a sturdy, intelligent and respectable yeoman\r\nstock.  And he has honored his heredity by his own intellectual\r\nand moral excellence.  Although my personal intimacy with\r\nhim has never been close enough to enable me to describe the\r\nfootsteps of his upward career with graphical exactness, or\r\nto enrich my memory with interesting anecdotes, I can bear\r\nwitness in a general way to his good characteristics, especially\r\nin his youth while he was nearest under my observation, and\r\nto some extent those of his mature years.  He was an industrious,\r\naffectionate, and dutiful son from childhood to maturity.\r\nHe evinced early intelligence, rationality and moral principle\r\nof a superior type, availing himself by close application\r\nof every opportunity for acquiring useful knowledge, and did\r\nso, as the sequel proved, successfully.  He was always an\r\nindependent, acute and logical thinker on a wide range of\r\nsubjects, as well outside of his professional life as inside.\r\nBut his constitution practically confined his ambition and\r\npursuits to the state of the world's affairs as manageable\r\nfor the time being, rather than to expending his energies\r\nfor the realization of theories greatly in advance of current\r\npublic opinion.  In this respect he differed from his friend\r\nwho writes this graphic contribution; whom nevertheless he\r\nalways respected.  But he was by no means a fossil conservative\r\nlagging in the rear of progress.  He marched just as far forward\r\nin the column as he was sure it could command the ground.\r\nThus he espoused the anti-slavery movement in politics in\r\nits germinal stage, and became one of the most sagacious and\r\nefficient organizers of the Republican Party in his native\r\nState.  Of this, however, others are better qualified to treat\r\nthan this friend.  The same is true of his pecuniary and\r\nfinancial achievements; also of his legal, judicial and official\r\nattainments.  Let abler pens in those departments eulogise\r\nhim.  Whatever this writer saw of him in the judicial chair\r\nor legal forum was unexceptionably creditable to him.\r\n\r\nOn the great themes of theology his conceptions and beliefs\r\naccorded mainly with those of the writer.  They were sublimely\r\nliberal and regenerative, excluding all notions of the divine\r\nattributes and government in the least degree derogatory to\r\nthe character of God as the Supreme, All-Perfect Father of\r\nthe Universe.\r\n\r\nHoping that his numerous personal friends in the various\r\nrelations of life will do greater justice and honor to his\r\nmemory than this pen can, the foregoing is respectfully tendered.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully yours,\r\n  ADIN BALLOU.\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to seek an explanation of Judge Thayer's\r\ninterest in life beyond the native tendencies which came to\r\nhim by lawful inheritance.  More than one person of his name\r\nand blood in former generations were noted for their public\r\nspirit and exercised a large influence in the affairs of the\r\ntown.  Traditions of two brothers, Captain Caleb Thayer and\r\n'Squire Elisha Thayer, are still fresh.  Captain Caleb Thayer\r\nwas the great-grandfather of Adin Thayer, Esquire.  Elijah\r\nwas grandfather of Hon. Eli Thayer, member of Congress from\r\nthe Worcester district, and founder of the Emigrant Aid Society,\r\nwhich had so illustrious a share in saving Kansas from slavery.\r\nEli Thayer tells me Elijah governed Mendon.  He always carried\r\nin town meeting what he wanted to carry, and killed what he\r\nwanted to kill.\r\n\r\nCaleb Thayer, the father of the Judge, was an early anti-\r\nslavery man, and one of the founders of the Free Soil Party.\r\nHe was a man of vigorous sense and great public spirit.  He\r\nhad large interests in Mendon and Blackstone.  He represented\r\nMendon in the Legislature and helped elect Charles Sumner\r\nto the Senate in 1851.  He was generally sociable and cheerful,\r\nbut subject to occasional periods of depression of spirits,\r\nwhen he liked to remain in solitude until the time of gloom\r\npassed by.\r\n\r\nAdin Thayer's education was chiefly in the district schools\r\nof his neighborhood.  Hosea Biglow may be taken as the type\r\nof the ordinary Yankee country boy of that day.  Adin had\r\nthe advantage, better, if you can have but one, than any\r\nuniversity, of being brought up in the country.  He was a\r\nmember of that absolute democracy, the old-fashioned New\r\nEngland country town, where character and worth were the\r\nonly titles to respect in the community, where the son of\r\na President or the son of a Senator or of a Governor stood\r\non an absolute and entire social equality with the son of the\r\nwasherwoman.  If the son of a President or Governor gave\r\nhimself any airs on that account, he had applied to him a\r\nvery vigorous and effective remedy well known to our Saxon\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nAdin Thayer came to manhood when the hosts of slavery and\r\nfreedom were marshalling for the great contest for the territory\r\nbetween the Mississippi and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nHe was soaked in Scripture, especially in the Old Testament,\r\na soaking which has somewhat the same effect on the moral\r\nand mental fibre that seven years in a tanner's vat used to\r\nhave upon sole leather.  How often I have known Adin, on some\r\ngreat political occasion or crisis, to crush some sophistry\r\nor compromise, or attempt to get things on a lower plane,\r\nby indignantly flashing out with some old text, such as, \"Righteousness\r\nexalteth a nation,\" or \"Sin is a reproach to any people,\"\r\nor answer, as he did once, to a gentleman who wanted him to\r\nsacrifice some moral principle for the sake of harmony in\r\nthe Republican Party, \"My friend, we will be first pure, and\r\nthen peaceable.\"\r\n\r\nAdin Thayer was a member of the School Committee of Worcester\r\nfor some years.  He was Senator from Worcester, I think, for\r\ntwo years, in 1871 and 1872.  He was appointed Collector of\r\nInternal Revenue for the eighth district by President Lincoln\r\non August 26, 1862, and gave way to a successor appointed\r\nby President Johnson, September 14, 1866.  He was reappointed\r\nby President Grant, June 22, 1872, and held the office until\r\nJanuary, 1877, when the eighth and tenth districts were consolidated.\r\nHe was appointed Judge of Probate by Governor Rice in the\r\nfall of 1877, and held that office until his death.  He was\r\nChairman of the State Committee in 1878.  He gave to the public\r\nthree or four essays or speeches printed in newspapers, and\r\nsome of them in pamphlet form.  They were, under one title\r\nor another, treatises on the moral duties of citizenship\r\nand appeals to the youth of the State to take their full and\r\npatriotic share in its administration.\r\n\r\nBut his function in life was that of an organizer.  He was\r\nan ambitious man.  But he never suffered his ambitions to\r\nstand in the way of what he thought was the good of the Commonwealth\r\nor of the party.  Many and many a time, as there are plenty\r\nof persons who can testify, it had been the expectation that\r\nhe would be the choice of his party for Senator or for Representative\r\nof the district in Congress, or some important municipal office,\r\nbut when the time came, Mr. Thayer was the first to suggest\r\nthat victory and harmony or the public advantage would be\r\nbest attained by some other candidate, to whose service he\r\ngave a zeal and efficiency which he never would have given\r\nin his own behalf.  He believed in party in politics, in organization,\r\nin work in the ward and in the school district.  But he believed\r\nin those things because they were, in his judgment, essential\r\nto the accomplishment of the highest results in the country\r\nand in the Commonwealth.  He was absolutely incorruptible,\r\neither by money or by office.  He was a man of clean hands\r\nand a pure heart.  His methods were as open as the daylight.\r\nHe conducted the great campaign against General Butler, when\r\nhe was Chairman of the State committee.  He came to Boston\r\nand found the knees of Boston trembling, people shaking in\r\ntheir shoes and their teeth chattering.  He went into the\r\ncommittee room, put things to rights, organized a campaign\r\nnever approached for thoroughness and efficiency in this Commonwealth,\r\nand during the whole time there sat at the table next his\r\nown a beautiful and refined young lady hearing and knowing\r\neverything that went on from the beginning of the campaign\r\nuntil the end.  He had no political secrets.  He never, to\r\nuse a common phrase, \"laid his ear to the ground.\" He never\r\nlistened for the stamping of feet or the clapping of hands or\r\nthe shouting or excitement or acclaim of the multitude.  His\r\near was to the sky.  He used to speak with infinite scorn of\r\nsettling questions of righteousness by a show of hands.  He\r\nhad a perfect faith in the American people and the people\r\nof Massachusetts, but it was a faith in the American people\r\nand the people of Massachusetts, governed by reason and not\r\nby passion, acting under constitutional restraints, listening\r\never for the voice of duty, a people acting not on the first\r\nimpulse, but on sober second thought.  He was often in the\r\nminority, and once or twice in his life a bolter.  He was\r\nnever afraid of being in the minority.  But he never was contented\r\nuntil he had changed or helped to change that minority into\r\na majority.  He was a politician almost from his cradle to\r\nhis grave.  He believed that the highest human occupation\r\nwas to take a share in the leadership and direction of a self-\r\ngoverning people.  He was a very tolerant, friendly and considerate\r\nman, in dealing with men who differed from himself.  He would\r\npardon sinners.  He would pardon politicians with whose efforts\r\nthere was, as he thought, even a mingling of ambition and\r\nself-seeking.  But he had nothing but hatred and contempt\r\nfor men who received all the benefits of the Republic, but\r\nshrank from any labor or sacrifice in its behalf.  To his\r\nmind the one base creature in the Commonwealth was the man\r\nwho said he was no politician.  He thoroughly believed in\r\nRalph Waldo Emerson's saying, which he borrowed from his brother\r\nCharles:  \"That is the one base thing in the universe, to\r\nreceive benefits and render none.\"  He had a clear business\r\nsense.  He was the best adviser I knew of in Worcester, with\r\nbut one possible exception, for clients who were in financial\r\ndifficulties.  He was a man of absolute integrity, of absolute\r\nveracity, and of a tender and boundless compassion.  One of\r\nthe most touching scenes I ever beheld was, when at his funeral,\r\namong the men of high station and of honor, there came forward\r\na little group of Negroes and fugitive slaves who had been\r\nattracted to Worcester by its reputation as the home of freedom.\r\nThey passed by the coffin with bowed heads and moistened eyes,\r\nevery one of them probably knowing him as the friend and benefactor\r\nwho had made life possible for them in this strange and unaccustomed\r\ncommunity.  He did not get carried off his feet by any sentimentalities.\r\n\r\nHe was the best of company.  You could not talk with him or\r\ntackle him without a bright and entertaining answer.  He was\r\nno great respecter of persons in such an encounter.  I remember\r\nmeeting him one day, when he said he had just been spending\r\nSunday in Canton.  \"Indeed!\" said I, \"my great-grandfather\r\nused to live there, and is buried there.\" \"Well, sir,\" he\r\nanswered, \"it may be a very respectable town for all that.\"\r\n\r\nA master of English fiction, who has won fame abroad, and\r\nwho dwelt for some little time in this country, has given\r\na most vivid and accurate description of Judge Thayer, his\r\nspeech and his style and eloquence and sense in a novel lately\r\npublished.  One of the persons of the novel asks an English\r\nfriend to the club, which he calls the State Club.  He goes\r\nto the Club, and this is what happens:\r\n\r\n\"The State Club held its meeting in the parlor of the well-\r\nknown Warrener House.  There were some fifty members present,\r\nwho received the Mayor with cheers, as he entered with his\r\ntwo friends.  A good deal of smoke was made, and a good many\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Hugh found interest in listening to some of the speakers,\r\nand in looking at some of the members.  Montaigne pointed\r\nout all of the notables.  One of the speakers* was a short\r\nman, with a corpulent body and a large open face; but he was\r\na born orator of a certain type.  Rounded and polished, mellow\r\nand musical, his sentences rolled from his mouth in liquid\r\ncadence and perfect balance.  Sir Hugh put him down as his\r\nideal after-dinner speaker.  He made his points clearly, neatly,\r\nand with occasional vigor that was always surprising.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* John D. Long.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n\"'He reminds me of the Younger Pitt.  Who is he?' asked Sir\r\nHugh, with a touch of enthusiasm that was in striking contrast\r\nwith his habitual and aristocratic insouciance.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, that,' said Montaigne, with a smile, 'is Mr. William\r\nShortley, commonly called Billy Shortlegs.  He is very popular,\r\nwell up in classics, and stands a good chance of being Governor\r\nsome day.  Shall I introduce you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Thank you, presently.  Whom are they calling for now?' inquired\r\nSir Hugh, as a chorus of voices cried out 'Amos Blackstone!\r\nAmos Blackstone!  Amos, Amos, Amos!'\r\n\r\n\"Montaigne himself was chanting 'Blackstone!  Blackstone!'\r\nwith great gusto.  When that gentleman rose, a perfect storm\r\nof cheers went up, during which Montaigne said: 'Now you will\r\nhear something, Sir Hugh.  I shall want to know what you think\r\nof him.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir Hugh put up his eye-glass, not that his sight was defective\r\nbut the occasion was important.  Mr. Amos Blackstone had arrived\r\nat the dignified age of three score years.  In some respects\r\nhe curiously resembled the previous speaker, though considerably\r\nhis senior.  He stood perhaps five feet five inches in his\r\nboots.  With the exception of his legs, he was a heavily built\r\nman, with a large head, an ample brow, a hairless face, very\r\nred, with large cheeks, and an under jaw like a lion.  His\r\neyes were small, but wonderfully bright and intelligent.  He\r\nlooked so portentously solemn, that when you learnt that he\r\nwas perfectly well in mind, body and estate, the inclination\r\nto laugh was irresistible.  This remarkable man began to speak\r\nin a husky, asthmatical voice, that gradually came out of\r\nthe clouds and grew clear.  His subject was, 'The Abstention\r\nof our Young Men from Politics: Causes and Cure.' He was evidently\r\na master of his subject, and spoke without notes.  He was\r\nabsolutely without any pretence to oratory; and yet for thirty\r\nminutes he played upon his audience as it were a pipe, and\r\nplucked out the heart of its mystery.  He was by turn, serious,\r\nmerry, doleful, witty, pathetic, humorous, ironical and gravely\r\nphilosophic.  When he was gay in speech, his face was funereal,\r\nand during the utterances of his grave reflections, his face\r\nwas lighted up with a winning smile.  There were moments when\r\none might have heard a pin drop; when one could not have heard\r\nhis name, if shouted, for laughter; when one's eyes gathered\r\na sudden mist.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Hugh did not once remove his eye-glass; he would have\r\nput up half a dozen glasses had he had them.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' enquired Montaigne, as the after-cheering subsided.\r\n'A grave, melancholy intellect, with a sprightly temperament;\r\na wonderful man.  Who is he?' asked Sir Hugh, dropping his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\"'His name, as you know is Amos Blackstone; he lives some\r\nmiles away; but he is a household name.'\r\n\r\n\"'Is he in business?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, a lawyer; a patent lawyer.  Have you ever heard of\r\nan institution called the Political Boss?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, yes.  At home we use him to a degree, as a sort of\r\npolitical Black Bogey, to scare naughty children who like to\r\nplay at Radicalism.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Amos Blackstone is a specimen of the Political Boss.'\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed?  You surprise me,' gasped Sir Hugh.  'Don't mistake\r\nme; they are not all like him.  He is a lion among jackals;\r\nthe best political organizer in the State.  But he is getting\r\ncrowded out by younger men.  We soon turn our war-horses out\r\nto pasture, in this country,' explained Montaigne.\"\r\n\r\nNo man among his contemporaries in Massachusetts had a larger\r\nnumber of devoted friends than Adin Thayer.  Many people who\r\nwere not counted among his acquaintances were attached to\r\nhim by sympathy of political opinions and by gratitude for\r\nhis important service to the Commonwealth.  He did a thousand\r\nthings for the benefit of the city, for the benefit of the\r\nState.  Many bad men found that somehow their ambitions were\r\nnipped in the bud by a process they could hardly understand,\r\nand many good men were called into the public service in obedience\r\nto a summons from a hand the influence of which they never\r\ndiscovered.  But there were four things he largely helped\r\nto do which were important and conspicuous in our history;\r\nI will not say things that he did, but they were things which\r\nwould not have been done, in my judgment, if the power and\r\ninfluence of Adin Thayer had been subtracted; things accomplished\r\nwith difficulty and with doubt.  He stood by Charles Sumner\r\nwhen that great and dangerous attempt was made to banish him\r\nfrom public life in the year 1862.  It was a time when Charles\r\nSumner, as he told me himself, could not visit the college\r\nwhere he was graduated, and be sure of a respectful reception,\r\nwhen a very important Republican paper, the most important\r\nand influential Republican paper in Massachusetts, declared\r\nthat Charles Sumner could not address a popular audience in\r\nNew York with personal safety; when, under the lead of the\r\nUnited States District Attorney, one of the most successful\r\nmanagers of a political meeting who ever existed in Massachusetts,\r\nan attempt was made to defeat a resolution of confidence in\r\nhim, in the Republican State Convention (when the whole of\r\nthe House of Representatives, or of the Caucus, or of the\r\nConvention, was on one side and Richard H. Dana was on the\r\nother, it was about an even chance which came out ahead),\r\nThayer stood by Mr. Sumner in that memorable State Convention,\r\nand helped save his great career to the country and to liberty.\r\n\r\nHe was a devoted supporter of John A. Andrew.  Andrew had\r\nbeen Governor the traditional three years, and there were\r\nmen eager to supplant him.  When Adin heard of a formidable\r\nmeeting called for that purpose, he exclaimed--I remember\r\nvery well the indignation with which he said it--\"They shall\r\nnot lay their hands on the Lord's Anointed.\" He sent a message\r\nto the meeting that he would fight their candidate in every\r\nschool district in Massachusetts.  The scheme was abandoned.\r\n\r\nHe was largely responsible for the defeat of the scheme for\r\nsubstituting biennial for annual election, and biennial sessions\r\nof the Legislature for yearly sessions in Massachusetts,\r\nalthough it did not receive its deathblow at the hands of\r\nthe people until after his death.\r\n\r\nBut his chief service, after all, was in keeping the government\r\nof Massachusetts clean and incorruptible, at the time of the\r\ngreat raid which was made upon the Republican Party in the\r\nyears between 1871 and 1883.  And yet, in all these services\r\nand contests he never appealed to a base passion or to a low\r\nambition in any man.  He summoned the nobility in men, and\r\nit answered to his call.  He loved with the whole intensity\r\nof his nature, his country, his Commonwealth, and the city\r\nwhich was his home.  He loved the great cause of human freedom\r\nand equality with the passionate devotion which a lover feels\r\nfor his mistress.  He was the most disinterested man I ever\r\nknew in public life.  He was not devoid of ambition.  He believed\r\nthat the holding of public office was the best method of accomplishing\r\npublic results.  But, as I have already said, when the time\r\ncame, he always subordinated his own desire to what he deemed\r\nthe welfare of the public.\r\n\r\nHe had, I think, one favorite poem.  He was fond of all good\r\nliterature, especially the Bible, and was never without its\r\nresources to illustrate or make emphatic what he had to say.\r\nBut there was one poem which was written to describe his and\r\nmy intimate friend, George L. Stearns, which I think was his\r\nfavorite above all the literature with which he was acquainted.\r\nI have often heard him quote its verses.  They set forth the\r\ncharacter and quality and life of Adin Thayer himself.  If\r\nThayer had died before Stearns, I believe Whittier would have\r\nwritten the same thing about him.  They are familiar to my\r\nreaders, I am sure, but I will close this brief and imperfect\r\ntribute by citing them once more:\r\n\r\n  He has done the work of a true man,--\r\n  Crown him, honor him, love him.\r\n  Weep over him, tears of women,\r\n  Stoop, manliest brows, above him!\r\n\r\n  * * * * * *\r\n\r\n  For the warmest of hearts is frozen,\r\n  The freest of hands is still;\r\n  And the gap in our picked and chosen\r\n  The long years may not fill.\r\n\r\n  No duty could overtask him,\r\n  No need his will outrun;\r\n  Or ever our lips could ask him,\r\n  His hands the work had done.\r\n\r\n  He forgot his own soul for others,\r\n  Himself to his neighbor lending;\r\n  He found the Lord in his suffering brothers,\r\n  And not in the clouds descending.\r\n\r\n  * * * * * *\r\n\r\n  Ah, well!--The world is discreet;\r\n  There are plenty to pause and wait;\r\n  But here was a man who set his feet\r\n  Sometimes in advance of fate,--\r\n\r\n  Plucked off the old bark when the inner\r\n  Was slow to renew it,\r\n  And put to the Lord's work the sinner\r\n  When saints failed to do it.\r\n\r\n  Never rode to the wrong's redressing\r\n  A worthier paladin.\r\n  Shall we not hear the blessing,\r\n  \"Good and faithful, enter in!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nPOLITICAL CORRUPTION\r\n\r\nJohn Jay said that the greatest achievements of diplomacy\r\nwere often little noted by history and that their authors\r\ngot, in general, little credit.  He compared it to the work\r\nof levelling uneven ground of which the face of the earth\r\nwill show no trace when it is done.  The same thing is true\r\nof successful battles with political corruption in high places,\r\nthe most formidable peril to any Government and, if it be\r\nnot encountered and overcome, fatal to a Republic.  A nation\r\nwill survive a corrupt minister or monarch, but a corrupt\r\npeople must surely and speedily perish.  We have had sporadic\r\nexamples of corruption in high office at several periods in\r\nour history.  The first sixteen years after the inauguration\r\nof the Constitution, including the Administrations of Washington,\r\nJohn Adams, and the first four years of Jefferson, were by\r\nno means free from it.  But it never got so dangerous a hold\r\nupon the forces of the Government, or upon a great political\r\nparty, as in the Administration of General Grant.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was an honest and wise man.  History has assigned\r\nhim a place among our great Presidents.  He showed almost\r\nunerring judgment in military matters.  He rarely, I suppose,\r\nif ever, made a mistake in his estimate of the military quality\r\nof a subordinate, or in a subordinate's title to confidence.\r\nBut he was very easily imposed upon by self-seeking and ambitious\r\nmen in civil life.  Such men studied his humors and imposed\r\nupon him, if not by flattery, yet by the pretence of personal\r\ndevotion.  He had been himself bitterly and most unjustly\r\nassailed by partisan and sectional hostility.  When any person\r\nto whom he had once given his confidence was detected in any\r\nlow or corrupt action Grant was very unwilling to believe\r\nor even to listen to the charge.  He seemed to set his teeth\r\nand to say to himself: \"They attack this man as they attack\r\nme.  They attack him because he is my friend.  I will stand\r\nby him.\" So it happened that attempts to secure pure and unselfish\r\nadministration got little help from him, and that designing\r\nand crafty men whose political aims were wholly personal\r\nand selfish got his ear and largely influenced his appointments\r\nto office.\r\n\r\nHamilton Fish, the Secretary of State, always retained his\r\ninfluence with President Grant.  He was a wise, able and thoroughly\r\nhonest man.  But as was fit, and indeed necessary, he kept\r\nhimself to the great interests which belonged to his Department,\r\nand took little share, so far as the public knew, in other\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cox, of Ohio, was an able, brave and upright man.\r\nHe resigned from President Grant's Cabinet, alleging as his\r\nreason that he was not supported in the fight with corruption.\r\nJudge Hoar strenuously insisted that the Judges of the newly\r\ncreated Circuit Courts of the United States should be made\r\nup of the best lawyers, without Senatorial dictation.  President\r\nGrant acted in accordance with his advice.  The constitution\r\nof the Circuit Courts gave great satisfaction to the public.\r\nBut leading and influential Senators, whose advice had been\r\nrejected, and who were compelled by the high character of\r\nthe persons nominated to submit, and did not venture upon\r\na controversy with the President, were intensely angry with\r\nthe Attorney-General.  The result was that when he was nominated\r\nby the President for the office of Associate Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, he was rejected by the\r\nSenate.  A few Senators avowed as a pretext for their action\r\nthat there was no Judge on that Bench from the South, and\r\nthat the new appointee ought to reside in the Southern Circuit.\r\nBut these gentlemen all voted for the confirmation of Mr.\r\nJustice Bradley, a most admirable appointment, to whom the\r\nsame objection applied.  Judge Hoar never doubted that the\r\nservice of a clean, able, upright Circuit Court, appointed\r\nwithout political influence, and entirely acceptable to the\r\npublic, was well worth the sacrifice.  Indeed the expression\r\nof public regard which came to him abundantly in his lifetime,\r\nand which was manifested in the proceedings of the Bar of\r\nMassachusetts, and the Massachusetts Historical Society, and\r\nin the press of the country after his death, was more valued\r\nby those to whom his memory is dear, than a thousand offices.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered Congress in 1869 the corridors of the Capitol\r\nand the Committee rooms were crowded with lobbyists.  The\r\ncustom of the two Houses permitted their members to introduce\r\nstrangers on the floor.  It would not be profitable to revive\r\nall the scandals of that time.  In general the men elected\r\nto the Senate and the House were honest and incorruptible.\r\nThere were some exceptions.  Adroit and self-seeking men were\r\noften able in the multitude of claims which must necessarily\r\nbe disposed of by a rapid examination, to impose on Committees\r\nof the two Houses.\r\n\r\nAs one of the managers of the Belknap trial, I alluded to\r\nsome of the more prominent and undisputed examples of corruption,\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n\"I said a little while ago that the Constitution had no safeguards\r\nto throw away.  You will judge whether the public events of\r\nto-day admonish us to look well to all our securities to prevent\r\nor power to punish the great guilt of corruption in office.\r\nWe must not confound idle clamor with public opinion, or accept\r\nthe accusations of scandal and malice instead of proof.  But\r\nwe shall make a worse mistake if, because of the multitude\r\nof false and groundless charges against men in high office,\r\nwe fail to redress substantial grievances or to deal with\r\ncases of actual guilt.  The worst evil resulting from the\r\nindiscriminate attack of an unscrupulous press upon men in\r\npublic station is not that innocence suffers, but that crime\r\nescapes.  Let scandal and malice be encountered by pure and\r\nstainless lives.  Let corruption and bribery meet their lawful\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\"My own public life has been a very brief and insignificant\r\none, extending little beyond the duration of a single term\r\nof Senatorial office; but in that brief period I have seen\r\nfive judges of a high court of the United States driven from\r\noffice by threats of impeachment for corruption or maladministration.\r\nI have heard the taunt, from friendliest lips, that when the\r\nUnited States presented herself in the East to take part with\r\nthe civilized world in generous competition in the arts of\r\nlife, the only product of her institutions in which she surpassed\r\nall others beyond question was her corruption.  I have seen\r\nin the State in the Union foremost in power and wealth four\r\njudges of her courts impeached for corruption, and the political\r\nadministration of her chief city become a disgrace and a by-\r\nword throughout the world.  I have seen the chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Military Affairs in the House, now a distinguished\r\nmember of this court, rise in his place and demand the expulsion\r\nof four of his associates for making sale of their official\r\nprivilege of selecting the youths to be educated at our great\r\nmilitary school.  When the greatest railroad of the world,\r\nbinding together the continent and uniting the two great seas\r\nwhich wash our shores, was finished, I have seen our national\r\ntriumph and exultation turned to bitterness and shame by the\r\nunanimous reports of three committees of Congress--two of\r\nthe House and one here--that every step of that mighty enterprise\r\nhad been taken in fraud.  I have heard in highest places the\r\nshameless doctrine avowed by men grown old in public office\r\nthat the true way by which power should be gained in the Republic\r\nis to bribe the people with the offices created for their\r\nservice, and the true end for which it should be used when\r\ngained is the promotion of selfish ambition and the gratification\r\nof personal revenge.  I have heard that suspicion haunts the\r\nfootsteps of the trusted companions of the President.\r\n\r\n\"These things have passed into history.  The Hallam or the\r\nTacitus or the Sismondi or the Macaulay who writes the annals\r\nof our time will record them with his inexorable pen.  And\r\nnow when a high Cabinet officer, the Constitutional adviser\r\nof the Executive, flees from office before charges of corruption,\r\nshall the historian add that the Senate treated the demand\r\nof the people for its judgment of condemnation as a farce,\r\nand laid down its high functions before the sophistries and\r\njeers of the criminal lawyer?  Shall he speculate about the\r\npetty political calculations as to the effect on one party\r\nor the other which induced his judges to connive at the escape\r\nof the great public criminal?  Or, on the other had, shall\r\nhe close the chapter by narrating how these things were detected,\r\nreformed and punished by Constitutional processes which the\r\nwisdom of our fathers devised for us, and the virtue and purity\r\nof the people found their vindication in the justice of the\r\nSenate?\"\r\n\r\nThis passage was quoted very extensively by the Democratic\r\nspeakers all over the country, and was circulated as a campaign\r\ndocument.  I was reproached by some of my Republican associates\r\nfor furnishing ammunition for the enemy.  But I was satisfied,\r\nand I am now, that in saying what I did I rendered a great\r\nservice to the Republican Party.  What was said helped to\r\narouse public attention, and the masses of the people--always\r\npure and incorruptible--set themselves earnestly and successfully\r\nto reform the abuses.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me that these abuses furnished any reason\r\nfor placing the powers of the Government in the hands of the\r\nSouthern Democracy, or their ally, Tammany Hall.  If the men\r\nwho saved the Union were not to be trusted to keep it pure;\r\nif the men who abolished slavery could not carry on a Government\r\nin freedom and in honor, certainly it was not likely that\r\nthe men of Tammany Hall, or the men who had so lately attempted\r\nto overthrow the Government, would do it any better.\r\n\r\nI happened to be at lunch with General Garfield just after\r\nthe Belknap trial.  He spoke of my argument, and expressed\r\nhis strong sympathy and approval.  I told him that I had been\r\nlooking into the history of the first sixteen years of the\r\nGovernment, which included the Administrations of Washington\r\nand John Adams and the first term of Jefferson, and that in\r\nmy opinion there was not only more corruption in proportion\r\nthen than there had been under Grant, but there had been more\r\nin amount, notwithstanding the difference in population.  I\r\nstated to him a good many instances.  He urged me to make\r\na speech in which I should say publicly what I had said to\r\nhim.  I acted on his advice, and in the course of a speech,\r\nin reply to Mr. Lamar, of Mississippi, I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Republican Party, as I have said, has controlled the\r\nGovernment for sixteen years, a term equal to that which covers\r\nthe whole Administration of Washington, the whole Administration\r\nof John Adams, and the first term of Jefferson.  It has been\r\none of those periods in which all experience teaches us to\r\nexpect an unusual manifestation of public corruption, of public\r\ndisorder, and of evils and errors of administration.  A great\r\nwar; the time which follows a great war; great public debts;\r\ncurrency and values inflated; the exertion of new and extraordinary\r\npowers for the safety of the State; the sudden call of millions\r\nof slaves to a share in the Government--any one of these things\r\nwould be expected to create great disturbances, and give rise\r\nto great temptations and great corruptions.  Our term of\r\noffice has seen them all combined.  And yet I do not scruple\r\nto affirm that not only has there been less dishonesty and\r\nmaladministration in the sixteen years of Republican rule\r\nproportionally to the numbers and wealth of the people than\r\nin the first sixteen years after the inauguration of Washington,\r\nbut there has been less absolutely of those things.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to be misunderstood.  I do\r\nnot wish to be misrepresented in this matter.  Let no man\r\nassert that I refer to the evils of those days as either\r\nexcuse or palliation for the evils of ours.  That generation\r\nwas a frugal and honest generation in the main, and they\r\nwould have visited with the swiftest condemnation and punishment,\r\nevery breach of public trust, whether through dishonesty or\r\nusurpation.  But they did not send to England for Benedict\r\nArnold.  They did not restore the Tories to power.  They did\r\nnot go down on their knees to George III. and ask him to\r\ntake them back into favor.  They believed that if the Constitution\r\ncould not be administered honestly by a majority of the friends\r\nof the Constitution, it could not be administered honestly\r\nby a majority of its enemies; that if liberty were not safe\r\nand pure in the hands of those who loved her, then liberty\r\nwas a failure upon the earth, and they did not think of intrusting\r\nher to the hands of those who hated her.  So in this generation,\r\nhad they lived to-day, they would have done simply what a\r\ndistinguished president of the convention in my own State,\r\nwhom the gentleman quotes, recommended; they would have taken\r\nthe Government from the hands of the lovers of liberty who\r\nare dishonest and put it into the hands of men who entertain\r\nthe same sentiments but who are honest.  It never would have\r\noccurred to them that because among one hundred thousand men\r\nthere are found some few who will not keep the eighth commandment,\r\n'Thou shalt not steal,' which is a mandate for all the public\r\nservice, they should put in power men who have no regard for\r\nthe sixth, 'Thou shalt not kill.'\"\r\n\r\nThere were several conspicuous instances of corruption with\r\nwhich I had personally to deal.\r\n\r\n1.  One was the Credit Mobilier.\r\n\r\nTwo Committees were appointed to investigate the affairs\r\nof the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and the Credit Mobilier\r\nof America.  One Committee investigated the conduct of some\r\nmembers of the two Houses of Congress against whom some charges\r\nhad been made.  Of that Committee Judge Poland of Vermont\r\nwas the Chairman.  The other Committee investigated the history\r\nof the Union Pacific Railroad Company to report whether its\r\ncharter had been forfeited.  Of that Committee Jeremiah M.\r\nWilson of Indiana, a very able lawyer and accomplished gentleman,\r\nwas Chairman.  The next member to him on the Committee was\r\nJudge Shellabarger of Ohio.  Owing to reasons, stated later,\r\nit fell to me as the next in rank to conduct the greater\r\npart of the examination, and to make the report.\r\n\r\n2.  Another was the impeachment and trial of General William\r\nW. Belknap, Secretary of War, for receiving a bribe for the\r\nappointment of a Post Trader.\r\n\r\n3.  A third example of the prevalent laxity of morals that\r\noccurred was the case of the Sanborn contracts.  I was a\r\nmember of the House when they were investigated, but took\r\nno special part in the proceedings.\r\n\r\n4.  A fourth example was the claim of Senators and Representatives\r\nwhich had been asserted in Andrew Johnson's Administration,\r\nand to which General Grant had partly yielded, to dictate\r\nthe appointment of executive officers.  In that way a vast\r\narmy of public servants, amounting to more than one hundred\r\nthousand in number, who were appointed and removed at the\r\npleasure of the Executive, became first the instrument of\r\nkeeping the dominant party in power, and afterward became\r\nnot so much the instruments and servants of party as the political\r\nfollowers of ambitious men to whom they owed their office,\r\nand on whose pleasure they depended for maintaining them.\r\nI made, in a speech at West Newton in 1876, an earnest attack\r\non this system, and afterward in the Senate had a good deal\r\nto do with framing the Civil Service Law, as it was called,\r\nwhich put an end to it.\r\n\r\n5.  Perhaps the most dangerous attack upon the purity of\r\nthe Government was the attempt of General Butler to get possession\r\nof the political power in Massachusetts, and ultimately that\r\nof the country.  What I was able to do to resist and baffle\r\nthat attempt is the most considerable part of the public service\r\nof my life, if it has been of any public service.\r\n\r\nI shall speak of each of these a little more fully.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for three of these, I regret to say, rested\r\nupon Massachusetts men, members of the Republican Party.  The\r\nUnion Pacific Railroad Company and the Credit Mobilier were\r\nmade up largely of prominent Massachusetts men for whom General\r\nButler acted as counsel.  When Mr. Ames was on trial before\r\nthe House of Representatives General Butler, then a member\r\nof the House, appeared as a member and took part and made\r\nthe extraordinary statement to the House that he was there\r\nas counsel for Mr. Ames.\r\n\r\nSanborn, who made the contracts, was a Massachusetts man.\r\nHis profits were used largely in affecting elections in Massachusetts.\r\nThe Treasury officials who were in fault, whether through\r\ncarelessness or corruption, were Massachusetts men, and the\r\narch contriver of the scheme was a Massachusetts man.\r\n\r\nYet the lesson which these things have taught me is that\r\nthe American statesman who believes that the doctrines of\r\nhis party are sound should never abandon his principles or\r\nquit political life because of its corruption.  Let him never\r\nfor any political advantage support or tolerate a corrupt\r\nman, or vote for a corrupt candidate.  If a man whose principles\r\nare good will yield to an evil motive, it is not likely that\r\nthe man whose principles are bad will resist it.  The American\r\npeople are upright and honest.  They will vindicate and stand\r\nby any man in the contest for honesty and uprightness, be\r\nhe Democrat or Republican, so long as they believe that the\r\nends for which he is striving are for the public good.  They\r\nwill not sustain a man whose counsel they think bad, however\r\nhonest he may be in his own conduct, or however much he may\r\ndesire to secure honesty in the conduct of others.  No man\r\never yet accomplished much good by abandoning his party while\r\nhe continued to hold its principles.  Many men have accomplished\r\na great deal of good by striving to purify it.\r\n\r\nEvery account of political history from the inside will exhibit\r\nabundant evidence of wickedness, wrongdoing, and petty personal\r\nmotives, of low ambitions, of bargains and sales, of timidity,\r\nof treachery.  The reverse of the most costly tapestry looks\r\nmean and cheap.  It is said that no man is a hero to his valet.\r\nThe reason is not that the hero is mean or base, but that\r\nthe valet cannot see anything that is great and noble, but\r\nonly what is mean and base.  The history of no people is heroical\r\nto its Mugwumps.  But, thank God, what is petty and personal\r\nis also temporary and perishable.  The voice of all history,\r\nespecially the voice of the history of our Republic, speaks\r\nto us the lesson which our great philosopher taught and so\r\nimplicitly believed,\r\n\r\n  Saying, What is excellent,\r\n  As God lives, is permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\nCREDIT MOBILIER\r\n\r\nDuring the election of 1872 many rumors appeared in the press\r\nof the country that there had been great corruption in the\r\nmanagement of the affairs of the Union Pacific Railroad.  It\r\nwas charged that the members of the House and Senate, some\r\nof whom were named, had been bribed by gifts of stock in the\r\nCredit Mobilier to secure their influence in legislation affecting\r\nthe Union Pacific Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Credit Mobilier Co. had been formed to take the contract\r\nfor building the Union Pacific Railroad.  The stockholders\r\nof the two companies were identical.  Each stockholder of\r\nthe Credit Mobilier owned a number of shares of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad proportional to his holding in the former\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe Union Pacific Railroad Company and Central Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany received liberal land grants from the Government of\r\nthe United States, that they might each build a part of the\r\nline which should connect the Atlantic States with the Pacific\r\nOcean.  In addition to the land grants, each road was to receive\r\na loan of Government bonds, payable in thirty years, of $27,000,000,\r\nfor which the Government was to pay interest, which interest\r\nwas not required to be repaid by the roads.  The roads were\r\nalso authorized to give a mortgage on their properties for\r\na like amount, of $27,000,000 each, which mortgage was to\r\nbe prior to the Government's lien for its loan.  The charter\r\nof the Union Pacific Railroad was granted by the Government\r\nof the United States.  That of the Central Pacific was from\r\nthe State of California.  The Government undertook to remove\r\nall Indian titles from the public land granted to the Union\r\nPacific Railroad for a space of 200 feet in width on each\r\nside of its entire route, and conferred the right to appropriate\r\nby eminent domain necessary private land for depots, turnouts,\r\netc., and public lands to the amount of ten alternate sections\r\nper mile, within the limits of twenty miles on each side of\r\nthe road.  It was required by the charter of the Union Pacific\r\nRailroad that its stock should be paid in full in cash, and\r\nthat the interests of the Government should be specially protected\r\nby the appointment by the President of five Government Directors.\r\nThe Government bonds were to be handed over on the certificate\r\nof an officer appointed by the President, as the road advanced\r\nto completion.  It was required that a Government Director\r\nshould be a member of every Committee, standing or select.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the Union Pacific Railroad acquired the franchise\r\nof a Pennsylvania Company, known as the Credit Mobilier, divided\r\nits stock among themselves in proportion to their ownership\r\nin the Union Pacific Railroad, mortgaged the road to the extent\r\npermitted by the act of Congress, being a little more than\r\n$27,000,000 and mortgaged their land grants for a further\r\nsum of $10,000,000.  Then they made a contract with the Credit\r\nMobilier Company to construct the road at a price which would\r\nexhaust all the resources of the road, including the proceeds\r\nof the bonds of all kinds, and divided the proceeds among\r\nthemselves as dividends on the stock of the Credit Mobilier.\r\nThis left the Union Pacific Railroad to begin business mortgaged\r\nto its full value, without any resources for its operation,\r\nand utterly stripped of the ample endowment which the bounty\r\nof the Government had provided for it.\r\n\r\nCongress supposed when this munificent grant of land and loan\r\nof credit was made it would create a great public highway\r\nacross the continent for the use of the Government and the\r\npeople, in war and peace, which should be a strong, solvent\r\ncorporation, ready for every emergency, and as secure for\r\nthe public use as New York Harbor, or as the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe devisers of this scheme soon got to quarrelling among\r\nthemselves.  One faction was made up largely of Boston capitalists,\r\nand the other of men belonging in New York, New Jersey and\r\nConnecticut.  The former wanted to have the headquarters of\r\nthe corporation in Boston, with a Boston man for President;\r\nand the latter desired to have the management in New York.\r\nA suit in equity was brought, and the Boston men, headed by\r\nOakes Ames, a member of Congress, and his brother Oliver,\r\nboth eminent and highly respected business men of Massachusetts,\r\nwere enjoined from voting at a stockholders' meeting held\r\nin New York for the election of officers.  The injunction\r\nwas issued by Judge Barnard, who was afterward impeached,\r\nand removed from office.  On the day of the stockholders'\r\nmeeting General Butler, counsel for the Ames faction, found\r\nJudge Barnard at lunch, and got him so to modify the injunction\r\nas to permit that the votes might be cast, the result of the\r\nelection not to be declared until the further order of the\r\nCourt.  The other faction who had rested with fancied security\r\nunder their injunction were taken by surprise.\r\n\r\nThe Ames ticket had a majority.  Thereupon one of the other\r\nfaction wrote a letter to Elihu B. Washburn, at Washington.\r\nHe was an influential member of the House of Representatives,\r\nknown as the \"Watch Dog of the Treasury.\" The letter was put\r\nin the post-office.  It exposed the whole transaction.  He\r\nthen informed his opponents what he had done.  They knew very\r\nwell that if Washburn moved an investigation by the House\r\nof Representatives, which was likely, the game was up.  No\r\nfurther bonds would come from the United States Treasury.\r\nJudicial proceedings would in all likelihood be taken at once\r\nto annul the charter, or restrain further action under it.\r\nThey instantly came to terms.  The two factions agreed on\r\na Board of Directors.  The letter to Washington was withdrawn\r\nfrom the mail.  Oakes Ames received a quantity of the stock\r\nof the Credit Mobilier, which he was to distribute among influential\r\nmembers of Congress at par, \"putting it,\" according to his\r\ntestimony given before a Committee afterward, \"where it would\r\ndo the most good.\"  A list of members of the two Houses was\r\nagreed upon, to whom the stock should be offered.  It was\r\nexpected that they would pay for it at par.  But there had\r\nbeen already a large dividend assigned to it, which with the\r\ndividend expected to be paid shortly, would amount to much\r\nmore than the nominal par value of the stock.  So the purchase\r\nof one of the shares was like purchasing for $1,000 a bank\r\naccount which already amounted to, or shortly would amount\r\nto, more than double that sum.\r\n\r\nA list of the men who were to be induced to take this stock\r\nwas made out with wonderful and prophetic sagacity.  It contained\r\nsome of the ablest and most influential men in the two Houses\r\nof Congress, representing different parts of the country.\r\nIt included men as conspicuous for integrity as ability.  Each\r\nof them occupied already a great place in the respect of his\r\ncountrymen, and nearly every one of them attained a much greater\r\nplace afterward.  This is the list of the members of Congress\r\nto whom stock was to be conveyed:\r\n\r\nLIST OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO WHOM STOCK WAS TO BE\r\nSOLD AGREED UPON IN NEW YORK, ENTERED IN OAKES\r\nAMES'S MEMORANDUM BOOK, AND TAKEN BY\r\nHIM TO WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n  James G. Blaine of Maine.\r\n  Senator James W. Patterson of New Hampshire.\r\n  Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts.\r\n  Schuyler Colfax of Indiana.\r\n  Thomas D. Eliot of Massachusetts.\r\n  Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts.\r\n  George S. Boutwell of Massachusetts.\r\n  James A. Garfield of Ohio.\r\n  Glenni W. Schofield of Pennsylvania.\r\n  William D. Kelley of Pennsylvania.\r\n  Joseph F. Fowler of Tennessee.\r\n  John A. Bingham of Ohio.\r\n  Senator James A. Bayard of Delaware.\r\n  William B. Allison of Iowa.\r\n  James F. Wilson of Iowa.\r\n  Roscoe Conkling of New York.\r\n  James Brooks of New York.\r\n  John A. Logan of Illinois.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Ames got to Washington he added the names of several\r\nSenators to his list, some of whom took the stock.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by an examination that men of great ability\r\nand influence were very skilfully selected.  Two of them\r\nafterward became Vice-Presidents of the United States.  One\r\nof them became President of the United States.  Another became\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.  Two others became Speakers of\r\nthe House.  Five others were very prominent candidates for\r\nthe Presidency.  Another was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee\r\nof the House.  Another became Chairman of the Committee on\r\nAppropriations and subsequently of Ways and Means.  Nine of\r\nthese gentlemen, then members of the House, were afterward\r\nelected to the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, Mr. Eliot, Mr. Bayard, Mr. Conkling and Mr. Boutwell\r\nrefused absolutely to have anything to do with the transaction.\r\nAll the others were fully acquitted on investigation, by the\r\njudgment of the House, of any corrupt purpose or any desire\r\nto make money or get private advantage by reason of their\r\nofficial influence, or of any expectation that they would\r\nbe likely to be called upon to take or refuse any action by\r\nreason of their relation to these corporations.  It was thought\r\nthat they had been careless in that they had not been put\r\non their guard by the fact that so large a dividend was to\r\nbe paid on the stock.  In all cases the amounts received were\r\nvery small, in general not amounting to more than $1,000.\r\nIn two or three instances the people thought there was want\r\nof candor or frankness in telling the full transaction to\r\nthe public, when the newspaper charges first made their appearance.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson never had any of the stock.  But some of his\r\nfriends made a present of a small sum of money to Mrs. Wilson,\r\nand the persons having the matter in charge invested a portion\r\nof it in Credit Mobilier stock.  As soon as Wilson heard of\r\nit, he directed that the stock be reconveyed to the person\r\nfrom whom it had been received, and gave his wife a small\r\nsum of money to make up the difference of what turned out\r\nto be the value of the stock and the value of the investment\r\nwhich had been made in its place.  There was no lack of the\r\nmost scrupulous integrity in the transaction.  Wilson met\r\nat a great public meeting Gen. Hawley, who was one of the\r\nspeakers.  Hawley told Wilson on the platform just before\r\nhis speech that he understood that his name had been mentioned\r\nin the papers as the owner of Credit Mobilier stock.  Wilson\r\nanswered that he never had any of it.  Thereupon Hawley in\r\nhis speech alluded to that matter and said he was authorized\r\nby Mr. Wilson to say that he never owned any of the stock.\r\nMr. Wilson did not get up and say, No, I never owned any.\r\nBut my wife once had a present of a little money which was\r\ninvested in it, and as soon as I heard of it, I immediately\r\nhad it returned to the person from whom it came, and I made\r\nup the loss to my wife myself.  Such, however, was the public\r\nexcitement that his omission to do that was held in some quarters\r\nas culpable want of frankness.\r\n\r\nAll the persons who received any of the stock and told the\r\nstory frankly at the investigation were acquitted of any\r\nwrongdoing whatever, and never in the least suffered in esteem\r\nin consequence.\r\n\r\nBut Schuyler Colfax and Senator Patterson of New Hampshire\r\nwere found by the Committee, and believed by the people to\r\nhave been disingenuous in their account of the transaction.\r\nThe Senate Committee of investigation reported a resolution\r\nfor the expulsion of Senator Patterson.  The case was a very\r\nhard one indeed for him.  The Senate adjourned, and his term\r\nexpired without any action on the resolution, or any opportunity\r\nto defend himself.\r\n\r\nSchuyler Colfax was also held to have given an untruthful\r\nstory of the transaction.  But the public attention was turned\r\nfrom that by the discovery, in the investigation of his accounts\r\nwhich the Committee made, that he had received large sums\r\nof money from a person for whom he had obtained a lucrative\r\nGovernment contract.  But his term of office as Vice-President\r\nexpired before any action could be taken, and he died soon\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames, whose character as a shrewd and skilful investor\r\nand manager of property stood deservedly high, recommended\r\nto his friends the stock of the Credit Mobilier as a safe\r\ninvestment, and one in his judgment very sure to prove profitable.\r\n\r\nIt has been often asked how the managers of the Credit Mobilier\r\ncould be guilty of bribing men when nobody was guilty of being\r\nbribed.  But the answer is easy.  The managers of the Credit\r\nMobilier knew that they had violated the law, and that an\r\ninvestigation would ruin their whole concern.  The men who\r\nreceived the stock were in ignorance of this fact.  It was\r\nas if the managers of a railroad whose route under State laws\r\nis to be determined by a city council, or a board of selectmen\r\nor some other public body, should induce the members of such\r\na board to take stock in their enterprise, intending afterward\r\nto petition the body to which the subscribers belonged to\r\nadopt a route very near land owned by them, which would much\r\nincrease its value, the receivers of the stock being ignorant\r\nof their scheme.  The person who should do that would be justly\r\nchargeable with bribery, while the persons who received the\r\nstock would be held totally innocent.  That was the judgment\r\nof the House of Representatives which acquitted the members\r\nwho had received the stock, but held Ames, who had conducted\r\nthe transaction, censurable.  A large number of the members\r\nvoted for his expulsion.  Ames was a successful business man.\r\nHe was regarded by his neighbors as a man of integrity.  He\r\nwas generous and public spirited.  But he and his associates\r\nin the Union Pacific Railroad seemed, in this matter, to be\r\nutterly destitute of any sense of public duty or comprehension\r\nof the great purposes of Congress.  They seemed to treat it\r\nas a purely private transaction, out of which they might get\r\nall the money they could, without any obligation to carry\r\nout the act according to its spirit, or even according to\r\nits letter, if they could only do so without being detected.\r\nThey seemed to have thought they were the sole owners of the\r\nUnion Pacific Railroad and of the Credit Mobilier corporation,\r\nand that the transaction between the two concerned themselves\r\nonly and not the public.  They treated it as if they were\r\ntransferring money from one pocket to another.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, Mr. Blaine, the Speaker, who\r\nhad been one of the persons implicated by public rumor, although\r\nin fact he had refused absolutely to have anything to do with\r\nthe transaction, left the Chair, and, calling Mr. Cox of\r\nNew York to his place, introduced a resolution calling for\r\nan investigation of the affairs of the Union Pacific Railroad.\r\n\r\nTwo Committees were appointed.  One, of which Judge Poland\r\nwas Chairman, undertook to deal with the charges against the\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives.  The other, of which\r\nJeremiah M. Wilson of Indiana was Chairman, was directed to\r\ninquire into the entire management of the affairs of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad and the Credit Mobilier.  I was a member\r\nof this last Committee.  A Committee was appointed also in\r\nthe Senate, with direction to inquire into the charges so\r\nfar as they affected Senators.  The whole country was profoundly\r\nexcited by the affair.\r\n\r\nI stood third on the Committee on which I was a member.  It\r\nwas thought best that Mr. Wilson, the Chairman, who was a\r\nvery able and distinguished lawyer, should go to Boston where\r\nthe books of the Companies were kept, and make a searching\r\nexamination of their books and accounts.  Mr. Shellabarger\r\nof Ohio, the second member on the Committee, one of the ablest\r\nlawyers in the House, was in poor health.  He consented to\r\nserve only on the condition that he should not be compelled\r\nto do any duty requiring any considerable labor.  So I had\r\nto a large degree the charge of the investigation in Washington,\r\nwhere the witnesses were examined, and in the end the duty\r\nof preparing the report.\r\n\r\nWe did not deal in our report with the alleged misconduct\r\nof the individual members of the House, but solely with the\r\ntwo corporations.  The report sets forth the transaction at\r\nlength, and contains the following summary of the Committee's\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the whole act was expressly declared to be\r\n\"to promote the public interest and welfare by the construction\r\nof said railroad and telegraph line, and keeping the same\r\nin working order, and to secure the Government at all times,\r\nbut particularly in time of war, the use and benefit of the\r\nsame for postal, military, and other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nYour committee cannot doubt that it was the purpose of Congress\r\nin all this to provide for something more than a mere gift\r\nof so much land, and a loan of so many bonds on the one side,\r\nand the construction and equipment of so many miles of railroad\r\nand telegraph on the other.\r\n\r\nThe United States was not a mere creditor, loaning a sum of\r\nmoney upon a mortgage.  The railroad corporation was not a\r\nmere contractor, bound to furnish a specified structure and\r\nnothing more.  The law created a body politic and corporate,\r\nbound, as a trustee, so to manage this great public franchise\r\nand endowment that not only the security for the great debts\r\ndue the United States should not be impaired, but so that\r\nthere should be ample resources to perform its great public\r\nduties in time of commercial disaster and in time of war.\r\n\r\nThis act was not passed to further the personal interests\r\nof the corporators, nor for the advancement of commercial\r\ninterests, nor for the convenience of the general public,\r\nalone; but in addition to these the interests, present and\r\nfuture, of the Government, as such, were to be subserved.\r\nA great highway was to be created, the use of which for postal,\r\nmilitary, and other purposes was to be secured to the Government\r\n\"at all times,\" but particularly in time of war.  Your committee\r\ndeem it important to call especial attention to this declared\r\nobject of this act, to accomplish which object the munificent\r\ngrant of lands and loan of the Government credit was made.\r\nTo make such a highway and to have it ready at \"all times,\"\r\nand \"particularly in time of war,\" to meet the demands that\r\nmight be made upon it; to be able to withstand the loss of\r\nbusiness and other casualties incident to war and still to\r\nperform for the Government such reasonable service as might\r\nunder such circumstances be demanded, required a strong, solvent\r\ncorporation; and when Congress expressed the object and granted\r\nthe corporate powers to carry that object into execution,\r\nand aided the enterprise with subsidies of lands and bonds,\r\nthe corporators in whom these powers were vested and under\r\nwhose control these subsidies were placed, were, in the opinion\r\nof your committee, under the highest moral, to say nothing\r\nof legal or equitable obligations, to use the utmost degree\r\nof good faith toward the Government in the exercise of the\r\npowers and disposition of the subsidies.\r\n\r\nCongress relied for the performance of these great trusts\r\nby the corporators upon their sense of public duty; upon\r\nthe fact that they were to deal with and protect a large\r\ncapital of their own which they were to pay in money; upon\r\nthe presence of five directors appointed by the President\r\nespecially to represent the public interests, who were to\r\nown no stock; one of whom should be a member of every Committee,\r\nstanding or special; upon the commissioners to be appointed\r\nby the President, who should examine and report upon the work\r\nas it progressed; in certain cases upon the certificate of\r\nthe chief engineer, to be made upon his professional honor;\r\nand lastly, upon the reserved power to add to, alter, amend,\r\nor repeal the act.\r\n\r\nYour committee find themselves constrained to report that\r\nthe moneys borrowed by the corporation, under a power given\r\nthem, only to meet the necessities of the construction and\r\nendowment of the road, have been distributed in dividends\r\namong the corporators; that the stock was issued, not to men\r\nwho paid for it at par in money, but who paid for it at not\r\nmore than thirty cents on the dollar in road making; that\r\nof the Government directors some of them have neglected their\r\nduties and others have been interested in the transactions\r\nby which the provisions of the organic law have been evaded;\r\nthat at least one of the commissioners appointed by the President\r\nhas been directly bribed to betray his trust by the gift of\r\n$25,000; that the chief engineer of the road was largely interested\r\nin the contracts for its construction; and that there has\r\nbeen an attempt to prevent the exercise of the reserved power\r\nin Congress by inducing influential members of Congress to\r\nbecome interested in the profits of the transaction.  So that\r\nof the safeguards above enumerated none seems to have been\r\nleft but the sense of public duty of the corporators.\r\n\r\nThe Judge Poland Committee investigated the conduct of the\r\nmembers who were suspected and acquitted all but two.  The\r\nHouse accepted their decision.  They recommended the expulsion\r\nof Mr. Ames and of James Brooks, one of the Democratic members.\r\nThere were some special circumstances in the case of Brooks,\r\nwhich it is not necessary to recite.  Brooks died before a\r\nvote on his case was taken.  The House by a majority amended\r\nthe resolution reported by the Committee in the case of Mr.\r\nAmes, and recommended a vote of censure, which was passed.\r\nAmes felt the disgrace very keenly, and did not live very\r\nlong afterward.\r\n\r\nThese disclosures did much to bring about the uneasy condition\r\nof the public mind which led to the Republican defeat in the\r\nelection of members of the House of Representatives in the\r\nfall of 1874, and brought Tilden so near to an election in\r\n1876.\r\n\r\nBut it may fairly, I think, be said for the majority of the\r\nRepublican Party in both houses of Congress, and the majority\r\nof the Republican Party in the country, that they did their\r\nvery best to deal firmly and directly with any fraud or wrongdoing\r\nthat came to light, even if their own political associates\r\nwere the guilty parties.  The political atmosphere has been\r\npurified as compared with the condition of those days.  The\r\nlobbyist is not seen in the Committee Room or the Corridor\r\nof the Capitol, as was the case when I entered Congress in\r\n1869.  I ought perhaps to say that I think the acquittal of\r\nBelknap on the ground that the Senate has no jurisdiction\r\nto render judgment against a civil officer on process of impeachment\r\nafter he has left office, was influenced by political feeling.\r\nI do not think most of the Republican Senators who voted that\r\nway would have so voted if the culprit had been a Democrat.\r\nBut there were many able lawyers who thought the opinion of\r\nthese Senators right.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nTHE SANBORN CONTRACTS\r\n\r\nThe forty-second Congress, at its second session, repealed\r\nall laws which provided for the payment of moieties, or commissions,\r\nto informers, so far as related to internal revenue taxes.\r\nBut a provision was inserted by the Conference Committee,\r\nwhich attracted no attention, providing that the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury might employ not more than three persons to\r\nassist the proper officers of the Government in discovering\r\nand collecting any money belonging to the United States whenever\r\nthe same might be for the interest of the United States.  The\r\nSecretary was to determine the conditions of the contract,\r\nand to pay no compensation except out of money received.  No\r\nperson was to be employed who did not file a written statement,\r\nunder oath, stating the character of the claim under which\r\nthe money was withheld or due, and the name of the person\r\nalleged to withhold the same.\r\n\r\nUnder this law John D. Sanborn of Massachusetts, an active\r\nsupporter of General Butler, applied for a contract which\r\nhe obtained on the 15th of July, 1872, for the collection\r\nof taxes illegally withheld by thirty-nine distillers, rectifiers\r\nand purchasers of whiskey.  He was then himself an employee\r\nof the Government as Special Agent for the Treasury Department.\r\nSecretary Boutwell being then absent or otherwise unable to\r\nattend to his duties, this contract was signed by Assistant\r\nSecretary William A. Richardson.  Sanborn had already been\r\nemployed to work up certain whiskey cases for which he had\r\nbeen paid $3,000 by the Government, and these cases were included\r\nin the foregoing contract.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of October, 1872, Sanborn made application to\r\nhave added to his contract the names of 760 persons, alleged\r\nto have withheld taxes imposed on legacies, successions and\r\nincomes.  An additional contract for that purpose was signed\r\nby the Assistant Secretary Richardson.  On the 19th of March,\r\n1873, Sanborn applied to have the names of more than 2,000\r\nother like persons added to his contract, which Mr. Richardson\r\npermitted.  On the 1st day of July, 1873, Sanborn again asked\r\nto amend his contract, and Assistant Secretary Richardson\r\nsigned the contract by which the names of 592 railroad companies\r\nwere included.  That was substantially a complete list of\r\nthe railroad companies of the country.  Some of them had been\r\nexamined by Government officials before the day of the contract,\r\nand the claims had been brought to light and found due.  Sanborn\r\nhad no knowledge of any delinquency, except as to about 150\r\nof them.  When he so represented to the officers of the Treasury\r\nDepartment he was told that it did not make any difference,\r\nand to put them all in.  Thereupon he took oath that they\r\nwere all delinquent, and had them added to the contract.\r\n\r\nThe form of this contract was taken, in part, from one prepared\r\nby Secretary Boutwell, which he had carefully considered with\r\nMr. Kelsey, a subordinate in the Treasury, in June, 1872.\r\nThat prepared by Mr. Boutwell, if adhered to, would have amply\r\nprotected the Government.  But it was departed from in essential\r\nparticulars.  Under Secretary Boutwell's contract only a small\r\nnumber of claims was included.  Sanborn collected, in the\r\ncourse of a year or two, $427,000, on which sum he received\r\n50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous report of the Committee of the House who investigated\r\nthe matter was written by Charles Foster of Ohio, afterward\r\nGovernor, and Secretary of the Treasury.  The Committee comprised\r\nthe following gentlemen: Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts;\r\nW. D. Kelly of Pennsylvania; Horatio C. Burchard of Illinois;\r\nEllis H. Roberts of New York; John A. Kasson of Iowa; Henry\r\nWaldron of Michigan; Lionel A. Sheldon of Louisiana; Charles\r\nFoster of Ohio; James B. Beck of Kentucky; William E. Niblack\r\nof Indiana; Fernando Wood of New York.\r\n\r\nThe Committee found that a large percentage of the $427,000\r\nwas not a proper subject for contract under the law, and that\r\nit would have been collected by the Internal Revenue Bureau\r\nin the ordinary discharge of its duty.  The law provided that\r\nthe person with whom it was made should assist the Treasury\r\nofficials in discovering and collecting, so that the collections\r\nwere to be made by the Treasury.  But the contract in fact\r\nsigned authorized Sanborn to make the collections, and required\r\nthe Treasury officials to assist him.\r\n\r\nThe Committee further called attention to the fact that the\r\nlaw provided that no person should be employed who should\r\nnot have fully set forth in a written statement under oath\r\nthe character of the claim out of which he proposed to recover\r\nor assist in recovering the moneys for the United States,\r\nthe laws by the violation of which the same had been withheld,\r\nand the name of the person, firm or corporation having withheld\r\nsuch moneys.  This provision was disregarded utterly.\r\n\r\nThe Committee found that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\r\nwas not consulted in the matter, nor was any official of his\r\nBureau, nor was he advised as to the making of the contracts\r\nor of the character of the claims, although the proper officials\r\nof the Government, referred to in the statute, could only\r\nhave been the officials of the Internal Revenue Bureau.  It\r\nwas shown that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue wrote\r\na letter protesting against the manner of these collections\r\nto the Secretary of the Treasury, which was never answered.\r\nThe Committee found that the Commissioner was studiously ignored\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury and the officials in his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe wicked and fraudulent character of the transactions is\r\nshown in the report.\r\n\r\nWhen the Committee made their report the matter was debated\r\nin the House of Representatives by Governor Foster and other\r\ngentlemen who had taken part in the investigation.  All these\r\nSanborn transactions were with the Assistant Secretary in\r\nMr. Boutwell's absence, until later Mr. Richardson became\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.  The Committee unanimously agreed\r\nto report a resolution that the House had no confidence in\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Richardson, and demanded\r\nhis removal.  President Grant was notified of this conclusion.\r\nHe sent for the members of the Committee and personally urged\r\nthem to withhold the resolution, and offered that the Secretary\r\nshould resign, and that he should be provided for in some\r\nother department of the public service.  To this the Committee\r\nagreed.  It was never thought that the Secretary himself profited\r\ncorruptly by the transaction, but only that he had suffered\r\nhimself to be hoodwinked.  It was unfortunate that nearly\r\nall the persons who were connected with this transaction were\r\nfrom New England, most of them from Massachusetts, and several\r\nof them from Lowell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nBENJAMIN F. BUTLER\r\n\r\nNo person can adequately comprehend the political history\r\nof Massachusetts for the thirty-five years beginning with\r\n1850 without a knowledge of the character, career and behavior\r\nof Benjamin F. Butler.  It is of course disagreeable and in\r\nmost cases it would seem unmanly to speak harshly of a political\r\nantagonist who is dead.  In the presence of the great reconciler,\r\nDeath, ordinary human contentions and angers should be hushed.\r\nBut if there be such a thing in the universe as a moral law,\r\nif the distinction between right and wrong be other than fancy\r\nor a dream, the difference between General Butler and the\r\nmen who contended with him belongs not to this life alone.\r\nIt relates to matters more permanent than human life.  It\r\nenters into the fate of republics, and will endure after the\r\nfashion of this world passeth away.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell the story of my life at a most important period\r\nwithout putting on record my estimate of him, and the nature\r\nof his influence over the youth of the Commonwealth.  Besides,\r\nit is to be remembered that he took special pains to write\r\nand to leave behind him a book in which he gave his own account\r\nof the great controversies in which he engaged, and bitterly\r\nattacked some of the men who thwarted his ambitions.  This\r\nbook he sent to public libraries, including that of the British\r\nMuseum, where he had good reason to expect it would be permanently\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nI shall say nothing of him which I did not say in public\r\nspeeches or published letters while he was living and in the\r\nfulness of his strength, activity and power.  History deals\r\nwith Benedict Arnold, with Aaron Burr, with the evil counsellors\r\nof Charles I. and Charles II., with Robespierre, with Barere\r\nand with Catiline, upon their merits, and draws from their\r\nlives examples, or warnings, without considering the fact\r\nthat they are dead.  This especially is a duty to be performed\r\nfearlessly, though with due caution, when it is proposed in\r\nsome quarters to erect monuments of statues to such men for\r\nthe admiration of the youth of future generations.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Butler was born November 5, 1818.  He was graduated\r\nat Waterville College, now Colby University, in the year 1838.\r\nHe began the practice of law in Lowell.  Compared with other\r\nmen of equal ability and distinction, he was never a very\r\nsuccessful advocate.  Quiet and modest men who had the confidence\r\nof the courts and juries used to win verdicts from him in\r\nfairly even cases.  He was fertile in resources.  He liked\r\naudacious surprises.  He was seldom content to try a simple\r\ncase in a simple way.  So that while he succeeded in some\r\ndesperate cases, he threw away a good many which with wise\r\nmanagement he might have gained.\r\n\r\nButler's practice in the beginning was chiefly in the defence\r\nof criminals, or in civil cases where persons of that class\r\nwere parties.  There was very likely to be a dramatic scene\r\nin court when he was for the defence.  His method of defence\r\nwas frequently almost as objectionable as the crime he was\r\ndefending.  He attacked the character of honest witnesses,\r\nand of respectable persons, victims of his guilty clients,\r\nwho were seeking the remedy of the law.  He had many ingenious\r\nfashions of confusing or browbeating witnesses, and sometimes\r\nof misleading juries.  He once asked a medical expert who\r\nundertook to testify about human anatomy, in a case of physical\r\ninjury, this question: \"State the origin and insertion of\r\nall the muscles of the forearm and hand from the elbow to\r\nthe tips of the fingers\"; and another, \"Give a list of the\r\nnames and the positions of all the bones in the body.\" This\r\nwas something like asking a man who claimed to know the English\r\nlanguage to give off hand all the words of the English language\r\nbeginning with a.  But it confused a worthy and respectable\r\ncountry doctor, and misled the jury.  The best citizen of\r\na country village, or his wife or daughter, who had to testify\r\nagainst a thief or burglar who had broken into a house had\r\nto encounter his ruffianly treatment on the witness stand.\r\nSo Butler became a terror, not to evil-doers but to the opponents\r\nof evil-doers throughout the county of Middlesex.  Few lawyers\r\nliked to encounter his rough speech and his ugly personalities.\r\n\r\nHe was a Democrat in politics and became quite popular with\r\nthe poorer class of foreign immigrants who gathered in manufacturing\r\ntowns and cities like Lowell.  He had at first little success\r\nin politics for the reason that his party was a small minority\r\nin Massachusetts.  He was elected to the House of Representatives\r\nfor the Legislature of 1853.  During that session there was\r\na memorable struggle on the part of the Whigs to repeal so\r\nmuch of the act providing for an election of delegates to\r\na Constitutional convention as required the election to be\r\nby secret ballot.  There was also, as an incident of this\r\nstruggle, an angry contest in the joint convention of the\r\ntwo Houses held for the purpose of electing some officers\r\nrequired by the Constitution to be chosen by joint ballot.\r\nThe dispute related to the extent of the authority of the\r\nPresident of the Senate, as presiding officer, to control\r\nthe joint assembly.  Butler was conspicuous in that scene\r\nof turbulence and disorder.  On the occasion of some ruling\r\nby the Whig Speaker, Mr. George Bliss, a worthy and respectable\r\nold gentleman, Butler called out in a loud voice: \"I should\r\nlike to knife that old cuss.\" That utterance was quoted not\r\nonly all over the Union, but in foreign countries, in England,\r\nand on the continent, and in the West Indies, as a proof of\r\nthe degradation and licentiousness of popular governments.\r\nIt is a singular fact that a like question as to the authority\r\nof the presiding officer of a joint convention of two legislative\r\nbodies came up in Congress when the electoral vote was counted,\r\nat the time of the election of General Grant in 1868.  Butler\r\nrepeated on a larger stage his disorderly conduct, until\r\nSchuyler Colfax, Speaker of the House--although Mr. Wade,\r\nPresident of the Senate, was then presiding over the joint\r\nconvention--resumed the chair of the House, in order, as Mr.\r\nBlaine described it afterward, \"to chastise the insolence\r\nof the member from Massachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nHe was chosen in 1860, when the Democratic Party was divided\r\nbetween the supporters of Douglas and the supporters of Breckenridge,\r\na delegate to the National Convention at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, by the Douglas Democrats of Massachusetts, under\r\ninstructions to vote for Douglas.  Instead, he voted thirty-\r\nseven times for Jefferson Davis.  There has been but one other\r\ninstance, I believe, in the history of Massachusetts of such\r\na betrayal of trust.  That other related not to candidates\r\nbut to principles.\r\n\r\nUnder our political arrangements the presidential elector\r\nis but a scribe.  He exercises no discretion, but only records\r\nthe will of the people who elect him.  The real selection of\r\nthe president is made by the nominating conventions.  The\r\nnominee of the party having a majority becomes the president.\r\nA breach of trust by a delegate to a nominating convention\r\nis an act of dishonor of the same class with that to which\r\nno presidential elector in the United States has yet stooped--\r\na breach of trust by an elector.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler's career upon the national stage began with\r\nthe episode at Charleston.  From that time until his death\r\nhe was a very conspicuous figure in the eyes of the whole\r\ncountry.  There are two or three public services for which\r\nhe deserves credit.  They ought not to be omitted in any fair\r\nsketch of his life and character.\r\n\r\nFirst.  When, in the earlier days of the Rebellion, there\r\nwas a doubt whether the Democratic Party would rally to the\r\nsupport of the country, he promptly offered his services.\r\nHis example was of great importance in determining the question\r\nwhether the war of sections was also to be a war of parties.\r\nHe had a large clientage, especially among that class of Irish\r\nAmericans who were apt in Massachusetts to vote with the Democratic\r\nParty.  His conduct so far was in honorable contrast with\r\nthat of some of his influential political associates, and\r\nthat of some of the old Whigs who never got over their chagrin\r\nat the success of the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nSecond.  When the question what would be the treatment of\r\nthe negroes by the commanders of the Union army was doubtful,\r\nand when many persons wished to conciliate the old slaveholders\r\nin the border states by disclaiming any purpose of meddling\r\nwith the institution of slavery, General Butler made a bright\r\nand important contribution to the discussion by declaring\r\nthe negro \"contraband of war.\"  I do not know whether this\r\nphrase was original with him or no.  It has been claimed that\r\nhe borrowed it.  But he undoubtedly made it famous.  This\r\ntended somewhat to obliterate the effect of the shock caused\r\nto the lovers of liberty by his offer to the Governor of Maryland\r\non the day his regiment landed at Annapolis, of his own services\r\nand those of the forces under his command, to put down any\r\nslave insurrection, in case the negro people should attempt\r\nto assert their heaven-born rights.\r\n\r\nGovernor Andrew wrote to General Butler censuring his offer\r\nof the use of the Massachusetts troops, as the first operation\r\nof the war, to improve the security of rebels that they might\r\nprosecute with more energy their attacks upon the Federal\r\ngovernment.  The Governor adds:  \"I can perceive no reason\r\nof military policy why a force summoned to the defence of\r\nthe Federal Government, at this moment of all others, should\r\nbe offered or diverted from its immediate duty to help rebels,\r\nwho stand with arms in their hands, in obstructing its progress\r\ntoward the city of Washington.\" General Butler answered that\r\n\"if the contest were to be prosecuted by letting loose the\r\nslaves, some instrument other than myself must be found to\r\ncarry it on.\"  He had been, with a large part of his party,\r\nan advocate and supporter of the Fugitive Slave Law, in the\r\ndays before the war.\r\n\r\nThird.  He governed the rebel city of New Orleans with great\r\nvigor.  He understood how to deal with a turbulent and ugly\r\npopulace.  He was not imposed upon by shams or pretences,\r\nand treated the old Southern Democracy with little respect.\r\nIt is probable that his vigorous remedy saved the city from\r\nyellow fever.\r\n\r\nFourth.  Another thing should be added to his credit, not\r\nof moral quality, but of that quality which accounts largely\r\nand naturally for his influence with the people.  He had a\r\ngift of clear, racy and simple speech.  He could convey his\r\nthought to the apprehension of common men without any loss\r\nin the process.  His style was of the same class with that\r\nof William Cobbett and Horace Greeley, without ornament,\r\nnot very copious, but simple, clear and vigorous.  When these\r\nthings have been said, nothing remains to be said in his favor.\r\n\r\nHe had a ready, though rough and coarse wit, suited to the\r\ntastes of illiterate audiences and to that class of men who\r\nare always delighted when anything is said in disparagement\r\nof anybody.  I recall two or three examples.  He was rather\r\nfond of appropriating the bright sayings of others, whether\r\njesting or serious, and claiming credit for them.  But he\r\nalso had a capacity of his own for such things.\r\n\r\nI heard him argue a case involving the constitutionality\r\nof the bill to annex Charlestown to Boston, before the Supreme\r\nCourt of Massachusetts.  He was interrupted by the Mayor,\r\nwho was on the other side, a fussy and self-important little\r\nperson.  Butler made the point that the meetings at which\r\nthe citizens had voted for annexation had not been legal,\r\nthe notice being not sufficient.  The Mayor, who had said\r\nit was the practice in Charlestown to hold public meetings\r\non a notice not longer than the one in question.  He added:\r\n\"We only gave a week's notice for our election of Mayor.\"\r\nButler looked at him a moment, and said:  \"I should think\r\nthey got up their Mayor on short notice.\"\r\n\r\nHis thrust at S. S. Cox in the House of Representatives attracted\r\nthe attention of the country.  It was in a five-minute debate.\r\nCox had attacked Butler savagely.  Butler replied, taking\r\nup nearly the whole five minutes with arguing the question\r\nbefore the House, taking no notice of Cox till just he was\r\nabout to finish.  He then said:  \"There is no need for me\r\nto answer the gentleman from New York.  Every negro minstrel\r\njust now is singing the answer, and the hand organs are playing\r\nthe tune, 'Shoo Fly, don't bodder me.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the Constitutional Convention of Massachusetts twenty-\r\nseven different schemes for a system of representation were\r\npressed.  Somebody moved to refer them all to a committee\r\nto consist of the persons who had proposed the schemes.  \"As\r\nwell refer twenty-seven babies to their twenty-seven mothers\r\nto decide which is the prettiest,\" exclaimed Butler.\r\n\r\nHis military career was, with the exception I have stated,\r\ndisgraceful to himself and unfortunate to the country.  From\r\nthe beginning of Butler's recruiting for the war, wherever\r\nhe was in command came rumors of jobs, frauds, trading with\r\nthe rebels through the lines, and the putting of unfit persons\r\nin responsible positions.  The scandal became so great that\r\nGovernor Andrew--than whom there was never a truer, nobler,\r\nbraver or more upright man in the executive chair of any State\r\nin this country--was compelled to put on public record his\r\nindignant denunciation.  He said in a letter to Charles Sumner\r\nand Henry Wilson, Senators in Congress, December 21, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"I am compelled to declare with great reluctance and regret,\r\nthat the course of proceeding under Major-General Butler in\r\nthis Commonwealth seems to have been designed and adapted\r\nsimply to afford means to persons of bad character to make\r\nmoney unscrupulously, and to encourage men whose unfitness\r\nhad excluded them from any appointment by me to the volunteer\r\nmilitia service, to hope for such appointment over Massachusetts\r\ntroops from other authority than that of the Executive himself.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Schouler's \"Massachusetts in the War,\" Vol. I., p. 276.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nThe first considerable military operation of which he took\r\ncharge was a movement upon the rebel forces at Big Bethel.\r\nIt was rash, unskiful, blundering and lacking both in perseverance\r\nand courage.  His troops were repulsed with great and needless\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\nIt is a doubtful and debated question whether General Butler\r\nwas personally to blame for this terrible and disgraceful\r\nrepulse.  If it were only his misfortune, it is a sample of\r\nthe misfortunes which attended him throughout the war.  It\r\nwould not have happened to a great or even a fairly good general\r\nofficer.  The best that can be said for him is that if he\r\nwere without personal blame, that it is the chief incident\r\nof a campaign which he went through without credit.\r\n\r\nBut the worst example of timidity and inefficiency in American\r\nmilitary history, not excepting Hull's surrender, was the\r\nattempt and repulse at Fort Fisher.  I do not mean when I\r\nsay timidity, personal cowardice.  But I mean the fear of\r\nthe ordinary risks which accompany every bold and successful\r\noperation in war.  This timidity is not infrequently, as it\r\nwas in this case, characteristic of men who thrust themselves\r\ninto places for which they are not fit.\r\n\r\nIt was highly important to capture Wilmington, of which Fort\r\nFisher was the key.  It was the last remaining gateway for\r\nthe admission of necessary supplies and ammunitions of war\r\nto the rebellious States from the outer world.  It was a military\r\nposition of great importance, a chief centre of the rebellion,\r\nand a great object in our military operations.  General Butler\r\nentered upon this undertaking with every advantage.  He had\r\nspecial detailed instructions from Grant, the greatest living\r\nmilitary commander; and he had under him and to cooperate\r\nwith him Admiral Porter who, with one possible exception,\r\nwas the ablest naval commander in our service.\r\n\r\nWilmington was stripped of troops.  The fort was garrisoned\r\nby four companies of infantry and one light battery.  With\r\nall the reinforcements which the enemy could muster but a\r\nthousand and seventy-seven men were in the fort.  The greatest\r\narmada ever in American waters was under Butler's command--\r\nfifty vessels, thirty-three for attack and seventeen in reserve,\r\nincluding four iron-clads.  The iron-clads opened fire upon\r\nthe fort, throwing one hundred and fifteen shells a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Fort Fisher replied at once with all its guns.  But those\r\non the northeast face were silenced almost as soon as the\r\nmonitors opened their terrific fire, and by the time the last\r\nof the large vessels had anchored and got their batteries into\r\nplay, only one or two of the enemy's guns were able to reply.\r\nThe shower of shells had driven the gunners to the bomb-proofs.\r\nIn one hour and fifteen minutes after the first gun was fired,\r\nnot a shot came from the fort.  Two magazines had been blown\r\nup, and the fort set on fire in several places.  Such a torrent\r\nof missiles was falling and bursting that it was impossible\r\nfor anything human to stand.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Badeau's \"Military History of General Grant,\" Vol. 3, p. 314.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nIn this condition of things General Butler arrived upon the\r\nscene.  Not a soldier had been hurt on the Union side.\r\n\r\n\"General Curtis was now within fifty yards of the fort, and\r\nsent word to General Ames that he could take the work, whereupon\r\nAmes, not knowing Butler's determination, gave orders for\r\nan assault.  Curtis at once moved forward, but by the time\r\nhe reached his position, night had come on, and the fleet\r\nhad nearly ceased its fire .... At this juncture Butler's\r\norders to reembark arrived, and no assault was made.  Curtis\r\nand the officers with him, declared that the fort could have\r\nbeen carried; that at the moment they were recalled, they\r\nvirtually had possession, having actually approached so close\r\nthat a rebel flag had been snatched from the parapet and a\r\nhorse brought away from the inside stockade.\r\n\r\n\"That night Butler informed the Admiral that he and Weitzel\r\nwere of the opinion that the place could not be carried by\r\nassault .... I shall therefore sail, he said, for Hampton\r\nRoads as soon as the transport fleet can be got in order.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Ibid., p. 317.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n\"Porter replied that he could fire much faster than he had\r\nbeen doing, and would keep the enemy from showing himself\r\nuntil our men were within twenty yards of the fort, and he\r\nbegged that Butler would leave some brave fellows like those\r\nwho had snatched the flag from the parapet and taken the horse\r\nfrom the fort.\"\r\n\r\nButler was unchangeable.  He got all his troops aboard, except\r\nCurtis's brigade, and started back.  In doing this Butler\r\nmade a fearful mistake.  \"My instructions to the officer who\r\nwent in command of the expedition,\" says General Grant, \"were\r\nexplicit in the statement that to effect a landing would be\r\nof itself a great victory, and if one should be effected,\r\nthe foothold must not be relinquished; on the contrary, a\r\nregular siege of the fort must be commenced and, to guard\r\nagainst interference by reason of storms, supplies of provisions\r\nmust be laid in as soon as they could be got on shore.  But\r\nButler seems to have lost sight of this part of his instructions,\r\nand was back at Fort Monroe on the 28th.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Grant's \"Memoirs,\" Vol. II., p. 394.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral, however, was of a different mind from Butler\r\nand replied to him:  \"I have ordered the largest vessels\r\nto proceed off Beaufort, and fill up with ammunition, to be\r\nready for another attack, in case it is decided to proceed\r\nwith this matter by making other arrangements.  We have not\r\ncommenced firing rapidly yet, and could keep any rebels inside\r\nfrom showing their heads, until an assaulting column was within\r\ntwenty yards of the works.  I wish some more young gallant\r\nfellows had followed the officer who took the flag from the\r\nparapet, and the brave fellow who brought the horse from the\r\nfort.  I think they would have found it an easier conquest\r\nthan is supposed.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Ibid., Badeau, p. 318.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n\"The Wilmington expedition has proven a gross and culpable\r\nfailure.  Many of the troops are back here.  Delays and free\r\ntalk of the object of the expedition enabled the enemy to\r\nmove troops to Wilmington to defeat it.  After the expedition\r\nstarted from Fort Monroe, three days of fine weather were\r\nsquandered, during which the enemy was without a force to\r\nprotect himself.  Who is to blame, will, I hope, be known.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Ibid., p. 318.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nGrant's statement, just quoted, was made when he had heard\r\nButler's side of the story alone.  What he thought when he\r\nhad heard the whole story will appear a little later.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Porter said, in his official dispatch:  \"My dispatch\r\nof yesterday will give you an account of the operations,\r\nbut will scarcely give you an idea of my disappointment at\r\nthe conduct of the army authorities in not attempting to take\r\npossession of the fort . . . . Had the army made a show of surrounding\r\nit, it would have been ours; but nothing of the kind was done.\r\nThe men landed, reconnoitred, and, hearing that the enemy\r\nwere massing troops somewhere, the orders were given to reembark\r\n. . . . There never was a fort that invited soldiers to walk\r\nin and take possession more plainly than Fort Fisher . . . .\r\nIt can be taken at any moment in one hour's time if the right\r\nman is sent with the troops.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of December Grant sent this message to Porter:\r\n\r\n\"Please hold on wherever you are for a few days, and I will\r\nendeavor to be back again, with an increased force, _and without\r\nthe former commander.\"_\r\n\r\nGrant at once took measures for renewing the attack and for\r\nchanging the commander.  On the 31st of December the Secretary\r\nof the Navy telegraphs to Porter:  \"Lieutenant-General Grant\r\nwill send immediately a competent force, _properly commanded,_\r\nto cooperate in the capture of the defences of Federal Point.\"\r\n\r\nSo in every instance in which the head of the military or\r\nnaval department of this country issued an order to cooperate\r\nin this expedition he found it necessary to assure the officer\r\nto whom he gave his orders that the expedition would be properly\r\ncommanded.  The Secretary adds in his dispatch to Admiral\r\nPorter:  \"The Department is perfectly satisfied with your\r\nefforts thus far.\"  On the next day Porter writes to General\r\nGrant:  \"I have just received yours of December 30th.  I shall\r\nbe all ready; and thank God we are not to leave here with\r\nso easy a victory at hand.  Thank you for so promptly trying\r\nto rectify the blunder so lately committed.  I knew you would\r\ndo it.\"  He adds, speaking of the late expedition: \"We lost\r\none man killed.  You may judge what a simple business it was.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of January Grant directs that Terry, who is to\r\ncommand this new expedition, be sent to City Point to see\r\nhim.  \"I cannot go myself,\" he adds to the Secretary of War,\r\n\"so long as Butler would be left in command.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 4th, the next day but one, Grant asks for the removal\r\nof Butler.  He says:  \"I am constrained to request the removal\r\nof Major-General Butler from the command of the department\r\nof Virginia and North Carolina.  I do this with reluctance,\r\nbut the good of the service requires it.  In my absence General\r\nButler necessarily commands, and there is a lack of confidence\r\nfelt in his military ability, making him an unsafe commander\r\nfor a large army.  His administration of the affairs of his\r\ndepartment is also objectionable.\"\r\n\r\nStanton had just left the capital on a visit to Sherman,\r\nat Savannah, and this letter at first received no answer; but\r\nGrant was very much in earnest, and on the sixth he telegraphed\r\ndirect to the President:  \"I wrote a letter to the Secretary\r\nof War, which was mailed yesterday, asking to have General\r\nButler removed from command.  Learning that the Secretary\r\nleft Washington yesterday, I telegraph you asking that prompt\r\naction be taken in this matter.\"\r\n\r\nThat was practically the end of Butler's military service.\r\nHe never received another command.\r\n\r\nThere is no country in the world, other than ours, where\r\nan officer guilty of such conduct, whether it came from incapacity\r\nor cowardice, would not have been promptly cashiered and probably\r\nshot.  This would have been true, as in the case of Admiral\r\nKeppel, if his fault had been merely a failure to attack.\r\nBut Butler's fault was an express disobedience of orders.\r\nThe order which he disobeyed was unknown to the subordinate\r\non whose advice he claimed to have relied.  General Grant\r\nexpressly ordered him that in case of failure to attack the\r\nfort by assault, he should remain and entrench his troops\r\non the peninsula, and cooperate with the fleet for the reduction\r\nof the place.  When Grant learned the circumstances he declared\r\nthat, in leaving after he had landed, Butler had violated\r\nhis express orders.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of just pride that a New England commander,\r\nand one of Massachusetts descent, General Terry, was successful\r\nin the new attempt.  Grant's instructions to him said: \"I\r\nhave served with Admiral Porter, and know that you can rely\r\non his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he proposes\r\n. . . . The first object to be attained is to get a firm position\r\non the spit of land on which Fort Fisher is built, from which\r\nyou can operate against the fort.  You want to look to the\r\npracticability of receiving your supplies, and to defending\r\nyourself against superior forces sent against you by any of\r\nthe avenues left open to the enemy.  If such a position can\r\nbe obtained, the siege of Fort Fisher will not be abandoned\r\nuntil its reduction can be accomplished, or another plan of\r\ncampaign is ordered from these headquarters.\"\r\n\r\nThe fort which had enabled 397 vessels to pass the blockade\r\nwas taken by a great New England Captain, and largely by New\r\nEngland troops.  Butler made one contribution, and only one,\r\nto that victory.  That contribution was his absence.  It was\r\na curious coincidence which would have brought a blush of\r\nshame upon any forehead but his, that when he was testifying\r\nbefore an investigating committee of Congress, who were inquiring\r\ninto the cause of his great and shameful failure to take the\r\nfort, and just after he had testified that Fort Fisher was\r\nimpregnable and that it was impossible for any Union force\r\nto take it, a dispatch was received in the Committee Room\r\nannouncing its fall.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant says in his \"Memoirs\":\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea of General Butler accompanying the expedition\r\nuntil the evening before it got off from Bermuda Hundred,\r\nand then did not dream but that General Weitzel had received\r\nall the instructions, and would be in command.  I rather formed\r\nthe idea that General Butler was actuated by a desire to witness\r\nthe effect of the explosion of the powder-boat.  The expedition\r\nwas detained several days at Hampton Roads, waiting the loading\r\nof the powder-boat.  The importance of getting the Wilmington\r\nexpedition off without any delay, with or without the powder-\r\nboat, had been urged upon General Butler.  The powder-boat\r\nwas exploded on the morning of the 24th, before the return\r\nof General Butler from Beaufort; but it would seem, from the\r\nnotice taken of it in the Southern newspapers, that he enemy\r\nwere never enlightened as to the object of the explosion until\r\nthey were informed by the Northern press.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* \"Personal Memoirs, U. S. Grant,\" p. 604 appendix.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n\"General Butler, in direct violation of the instructions\r\ngiven, ordered the reembarkation of the troops and the return\r\nof the expedition.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Ibid., p. 605.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n\"I advised Admiral Porter to hold on, and that I would send\r\na force and make another attempt to take the place.  This\r\ntime I selected Major-General A. H. Terry to command the expedition.\"\r\n\"At my request Major-General B. F. Butler was relieved.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Ibid., p. 607.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nI will not undertake to give a detailed account of the blundering\r\nstrategy of what General Grant aptly called the \"Bottling\r\nup at Bermuda Hundred\" which enabled a powerful Union army\r\nto be held in check by a small Confederate force, leaving\r\nfree the bulk of their army for hostile operations against\r\nthe Union forces.\r\n\r\nSo the contribution of General Butler's military genius to\r\nthe success of the United States in the war consisted of\r\na scheme to blow up a powder-boat in the capture of Fort\r\nFisher, somewhat after the Chinese fashion of warfare, which\r\nGeneral Grant said hardly had the effect to excite the curiosity\r\nof the occupants of the fort which it had been intended to\r\ndemolish; and of his scheme of engineering at Dutch Gap and\r\nBermuda Hundred.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant got tired of him at last and ordered him to\r\nreport at Lowell.  So ended the military career of incompetence,\r\nboasting and failure.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts soldiers from those of the humblest origin\r\nto those who came from the most cultivated circles have always\r\nhad the reputation of gentlemen.  I know of but one conspicuous\r\nexception in her entire military history.  During the trial\r\nof Andrew Johnson, Butler, who was one of the managers, employed\r\nspies to visit, in his absence, the room of William M. Evarts,\r\ncounsel for the President, and to search his waste basket\r\nin the hope of spying upon his correspondence.  Of this he\r\nshamelessly afterward boasted.  Later he employed dishonest\r\npersons to get from the wires the private telegraphic dispatches\r\nof Henry L. Pierce, then his colleague in the House of Representatives,\r\nsent to the Hon. W. W. Rice at Worcester.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all.  Wherever Butler is found in military\r\ncommand there were constant rumors of the same story which\r\nGovernor Andrew told in the beginning.  It is like the ointment\r\nof the hand which bewrayeth itself.  Jobs, fraudulent contracts,\r\ntrading through the lines, relatives enriched by public plunder,\r\ncorrupt understanding with the enemy.  These stories pursued\r\nhim to New Orleans and from New Orleans back to Lowell.  Is\r\nthere another Union General, at least was there ever another\r\nMassachusetts General to whose integrity such suspicion attached?\r\nHe scarcely undertook to discuss the matter himself.  After\r\nthe war a New Orleans bank, on which Butler had made a requisition\r\nfor eighty thousand dollars in gold, employed the late Edwards\r\nPierpont to bring an action against General Butler on the\r\nground that the money had never been paid over to the Government,\r\nbut that he had kept it himself.  Butler saw the counsel for\r\nthe plaintiffs and said he had received the money in an official\r\ncapacity and had paid it over to the United States.  Mr. Pierpont\r\nanswered:  \"If you will show that, it will constitute a good\r\ndefence.\"  In the course of the conversation Pierpont said:\r\n\"Your neighbors in Lowell will not think very well of it when\r\nthey see you riding in your carriage through the streets,\r\nand know it was paid for out of the money you have taken unlawfully\r\nfrom this bank.\"  Before the time came for the trial Butler\r\nsurrendered and paid over the money.  After the matter was\r\nsettled he said to Mr. Pierpont:  \"Well, you beat me.  But\r\nI want to tell you that you made one mistake.  You said the\r\npeople of Lowell would not think very highly of me when they\r\nsaw me riding through the streets in my carriage and knew\r\nit was paid for by the money of this bank.  The people would\r\nthink I was a fool for not having taken twice as much.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler was appointed treasurer of the National Soldiers'\r\nHome.  He mingled the money of that institution with his own,\r\ngot the use of it, got interest upon it, for which he never\r\naccounted.  An attempt was made to investigate his accounts\r\nand he refused on the ground that he could not do it without\r\nshowing his private account books, which he was not compelled\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nHe had a powerful political influence which made him an object\r\nof terror to timid and ambitious men.  So, much to the shame\r\nof our public authorities, the investigation was not pressed.\r\nHe was allowed to pay over only such sum as he himself admitted\r\nto be due.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler's chief title to distinction in political life\r\nwas a scheme which Massachusetts has pronounced a scheme\r\nof dishonesty and infamy in every method by which her sentiment\r\ncan be made known.  This scheme was to pay off the national\r\ndebt and all other debts public and private, including all\r\nwidows' and soldiers' pensions, in irredeemable paper money.\r\nHe proposed to issue a series of government bonds bearing\r\ninterest, payable like the principal, in greenbacks, and providing\r\nthat the greenbacks should never be redeemed, but that the\r\nholder might at any time, on demand, get from the Treasury\r\nthe equivalent in bonds.  This scheme had been announced by\r\nGeneral Butler for several years before the Presidential election\r\nof 1876.  In that year General Butler, who had been defeated\r\nfor reelection to Congress from the Essex district in 1874,\r\nwas a candidate for the Republican nomination in the Middlesex\r\ndistrict, which included his home in Lowell.  There was much\r\nopposition to him.  But the party feeling was very strong\r\nand no other person of large enough reputation or of conspicuous\r\nability could be found to take the Republican nomination.\r\nGeneral Butler was accordingly nominated with the distinct\r\npromise on his part that he would surrender his plans in regard\r\nto finance out of deference to the known wishes of his constituents,\r\nand would act with the Republican Party upon financial questions.\r\nTo this pledge he owed, if not his nomination and election,\r\ncertainly his great majority in the convention and at the\r\npolls.  This pledge, as in the case of the trust which had\r\nbeen committed to him by the Douglas Democrats before the\r\nwar, he most unblushingly and shamelessly violated.  He renewed\r\nand advocated his fiat money scheme.  The result was that\r\nat the next convention of the Republican Party in his district\r\nthe following resolution was passed, without a dissenting\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That we warn the people of the Commonwealth,\r\nwhose votes General Butler is now soliciting by promises to\r\nserve them faithfully, that his professions when seeking office\r\nhave been found in our experience to be easily made and as\r\neasily repudiated when the time for redeeming them came.\r\n\r\n\"That they are neither gold nor good paper, but are a kind\r\nof fiat currency, having no intrinsic character, being cheap,\r\ndelusive, irredeemable and worthless.\"\r\n\r\nThis convention represented a large and overwhelming majority\r\nof the people of the Middlesex district.  It was made up as\r\nsuch conventions in Massachusetts always are made up, of men\r\nof high standing and character and of great personal worth.\r\nCan there be found in the history of Massachusetts such a\r\nrecord of shameless dishonor and such a terrible indictment\r\nand conviction?\r\n\r\nA like judgment was expressed a little later by Mr. Edward\r\nAvery, a Democrat of high standing, who declared that the\r\nDemocratic Party had found his promises and pledges could\r\nnot be trusted.\r\n\r\nHe was once elected Governor.  It so chanced that the Republican\r\nParty had been disappointed by the defeat in their State Convention\r\nof Mr. Crapo, a gentleman of the highest standing, who had\r\nrendered conspicuous service to his country in the National\r\nHouse of Representatives, and who was doubtless the choice\r\nof a majority of his party.  His successful competitor was\r\na man of much personal worth and highly esteemed.  But it\r\nwas thought that his nomination had been compassed by skilful\r\npolitical management by which the will of the people had been\r\nbaffled and defeated, and many Republicans declined to vote.\r\nThere was a certain curiosity, as many men expressed it, to\r\nsee what Butler would do and to test his professions of reform,\r\nwith a feeling that he would be quite harmless with a Republican\r\nLegislature and Council.  So the experiment was tried.  The\r\npeople of the Commonwealth had no desire to try it a second\r\ntime.  The matter of General Butler's title to public respect,\r\nif the rest of his record could be erased as by a wet sponge,\r\nmight be determined by the experience of a single year.  There\r\nwas never such an exhibition as that made by him in the executive\r\nchair of Massachusetts.  He proceeded to attack, to promote\r\nhis own ambitions, the fair name and fame of the Commonwealth\r\nitself.  One of his speeches was so gross in its nature that\r\nthe principal Democratic paper of Boston refused to print\r\nit, declaring it unfit for publication.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler declared in one of his public speeches when\r\na candidate for Governor, thereby insulting the Commonwealth,\r\nespecially the citizen-soldiery of Massachusetts, that the\r\nsoldiers of Massachusetts \"needed but a word from him to clean\r\nout the State House.\"\r\n\r\nBut he had his eye on a still higher prize.  He hoped to\r\ncompass the Democratic nomination for the Presidency.  That\r\nnomination depended on his conciliating the old Democratic,\r\nrebel element at the South, then powerful in National Democratic\r\ncouncils.  He made an attack upon the administration of the\r\nState Almshouse at Tewksbury, in which he declared that \"the\r\nselling and tanning of human skins was an established industry\r\nin Massachusetts.\"  He charged the Commonwealth with desecrating\r\nthe graves and selling the bodies of deceased inmates of her\r\npublic institutions for money.  General Butler's charges were\r\nrefuted to the public satisfaction by the simple certificate\r\nof Mrs. Clara Leonard, a member of the State Board of Lunacy\r\nand Charities, who knew all about the matter, and in whose\r\nhigh integrity and capacity to decide the question everybody\r\nhad implicit confidence.\r\n\r\nThere was an investigation, and Butler signally failed to\r\nsustain himself.  One incident at the hearing revealed perfectly\r\nhis character and that of his affected sympathy for downtrodden\r\nhumanity.  Some human remains were brought into the presence\r\nof the committee, which it was alleged had come from the almshouse.\r\nButler was in an angry mood at something that had occurred\r\nand called out peremptorily: \"Give me the skin that came off\r\nthe nigger.\"\r\n\r\nI will not undertake myself to impute the motive which inspired\r\nthis attack upon his own State.  Whether it were anger inspired\r\nby the knowledge of the estimate in which the majority of\r\nher people held him; whether it were a gross nature with blunted\r\nsensibilities; whether these expressions were uttered in haste\r\nor anger, I will not say.  The Honorable William P. Frye,\r\nan able and justly distinguished Representative and Senator\r\nfrom Maine, with an intimate knowledge of General Butler,\r\nwhich came from a long association in the public service,\r\ncharged General Butler in a public speech in Massachusetts,\r\nin the autumn of 1883, in my hearing, what he repeated at\r\nmany places elsewhere in the Commonwealth--that Butler had\r\nmade this foul charge against Massachusetts in order that\r\nhe might win the favor of the slave-holding and rebel Democratic\r\nelements of the South by catering to their prejudices against\r\nher.  If that be true, this charge of General Butler's is\r\nthe most disgraceful single utterance that ever came from\r\nAmerican lips.  If it be not true, what must be the nature\r\nof which the gentle, charitable and kindly Senator Frye could\r\nbelieve it true after an intimate knowledge so many years?\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler was disappointed in his expectation of Democratic\r\nsupport in the country at large.  He had thereafter no rest\r\nin politics for the sole of his foot.  The remainder of his\r\nlife was spent in speculation and manufacturing enterprises.\r\n\r\nI repeat what I said of General Butler in his lifetime, when\r\nhe was at the height of his power, with a full knowledge\r\nof his vindictive character, that the success of his attempt\r\nto use and consolidate the political forces of Massachusetts\r\nwould have been the corruption of her youth, the destruction\r\nof everything valuable in her character, and the establishment\r\nat the mouth of the Charles River of another New York with\r\nits frauds, Tweed rings and scandals.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler made an earnest effort to get the Republican\r\nnomination for Governor in 1871.  He had built up what was\r\ncalled a Butler party, in which he had had the aid of the\r\nNational Administration, and of all persons whom he could\r\neither seduce by hope of reward or terrify by fear of his\r\nvengeance.  It was not a question in considering candidacy\r\nfor office with him whether the man had rendered honest service\r\nin civil or in military life, whether he was a man of honor\r\nor of good or bad character, but only whether he was a Butler\r\nman.  He conducted his own campaign for Governor in 1871 and\r\nagain in 1873.  In the former he summoned his adherents to\r\nthe State Convention, issuing a circular in which he advised\r\nthem to bring three days' rations in the expectation of a\r\nlong and angry struggle.\r\n\r\nI was invited by the State Central Committee to preside at\r\nthe Convention of 1871.  It was quite likely that the Convention\r\nmight break up in disorder and the result would be two factions,\r\neach claiming to be the regular Republican organization.  I\r\ntold the gentlemen of the State Central Committee, who communicated\r\nto me their desire, that I would do it on condition that there\r\nshould be provided one hundred skilled and trustworthy police\r\nofficers who would obey my orders, and, if it became necessary,\r\nwould remove from the hall General Butler or any other person\r\nwho should defy the authority of the Convention.  This the\r\ncommittee promised to do.  This promise was in substance kept.\r\nThe gentleman who made it as the organ of the State Central\r\nCommittee had himself been for many years a sheriff of the\r\nCounty of Worcester, and had been a General in the Civil\r\nWar, and was a man of large capacity for handling disorderly\r\nassemblies.  He came to me afterward and said that in a hall\r\nlike Mechanics Hall a well-disciplined force of not more than\r\nfifty men would be better for the purpose of keeping order\r\nthan a more numerous one, and he had taken the liberty of\r\ndeparting from our agreement to that extent.  To this I assented.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to the Hall that morning in taking leave of my\r\nwife I told her that the chances were that I should come\r\nhome the most disgraced man in Massachusetts.  If General\r\nButler succeeded in breaking up the Convention in disorder\r\nthe blame would be laid upon the presiding officer.\r\n\r\nBut we got through safely.  General Butler had calculated\r\nthat his opponents, who were divided among several candidates,\r\ncould not agree upon any one.  But such an agreement was effected\r\nupon William B. Washburn.  His plan then, I supposed, was\r\nto find some excuse for breaking up the Convention under circumstances\r\nwhich would enable him to claim to President Grant that he\r\nrepresented the regular Republican organization and that his\r\nopponents were the bolters.  My duty on the other hand was\r\nso to conduct the Convention that there should be no pretext\r\non his part for such a course.  The Convention was in continuous\r\nsession from 11 o'clock in the forenoon until half-past one\r\nnext morning.  There were several contests in which Butler\r\nconducted the case on his own side.  But his opponents held\r\ntogether and nominated William B. Washburn.  With the exception\r\nof the National Convention of 1880, at which I also presided,\r\nthis was the most difficult duty in the way of presiding over\r\na deliberative assembly which ever fell upon any person in\r\nthis country so far as I know.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1873 General Butler made another attempt to get\r\nthe Republican nomination for Governor.  A meeting was called\r\nat Hamilton Hall, in Boston, of a few persons opposed to his\r\ncandidacy, which resulted in an address to the people recommending\r\nthe reelection of Mr. Washburn.  I signed the address of which\r\nI wrote a few sentences.  Judge Hoar made a bright and characteristic\r\nspeech in which he said that \"the people of Massachusetts\r\nwould not yield the office of Governor to a Tichborne claimant,\r\nwhether with or without a bond.\" This name, \"the Claimant,\"\r\nstuck to Butler for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 my opposition to General Butler and support of Governor\r\nWashburn was well known.  I announced my preference for the\r\nlatter in a letter to the Springfield _Republican._ This did\r\nnot occasion any personal quarrel with Butler, although our\r\nrelations were never cordial.  But in 1873 he was very angry\r\nwith the persons who signed the address in favor of the renomination\r\nof Governor Washburn.  He wrote a letter to the people of\r\nMassachusetts in which he angrily attacked many persons in\r\nthe Republican party whom he believed to be his opponents.\r\nAmong them he bitterly attacked me.  He sent a copy of this\r\nletter in the form of a broadside to every newspaper in Massachusetts,\r\nI believe, and had it folded into every copy of the paper.\r\nI instantly replied, setting forth as well as I could the\r\ncharacter and quality of General Butler and the nature of\r\nhis influence upon the youth of the Commonwealth.  The letter\r\ncontained the following sentences:\r\n\r\n\"When General Butler proposed to pay off our national debt\r\nin irredeemable paper, General Grant silenced him with the\r\nringing sentence in his inaugural, 'Let it be understood that\r\nno repudiator of one farthing of our public debt will be trusted\r\nin public place,' because he knew that he was trying to tempt\r\nthis people to escape from a burden by a mean and base act.\r\n\r\n\"He has quarrelled with Grant and Wilson, and Colfax and Blaine,\r\nand Andrew, and Sumner, and the Washburnes, and Bingham, and\r\nSchenck, and Dawes, because he is quarrelsome.  They have\r\nbeen compelled, each in his own way, to chastise and punish\r\nhim because he deserved to be whipped.\r\n\r\n\"Among the unprincipled adventurers who gained favor in the\r\ncorrupt times of the Stuarts, and whose evil counsels brought\r\nCharles the First to his doom, the most notorious was Buckingham.\r\nGaining favor by lending himself as the subservient tool in\r\naccomplishing every evil purpose:  restless, ambitious, unscrupulous,\r\nselfish, revengeful, thrusting himself into military employments\r\nfor which he was unfit and from which he was compelled to\r\nretire in disgrace, getting a 'competent private fortune'\r\nby dishonest practices, which he lavished in overcoming the\r\nvirtue of timid and venal men, his name is the shame of England.\r\nNugent says of him: 'His shrewdness in judging of men was\r\nemployed only to enable him to found his influence upon their\r\nweaknesses and vices; so that, when opposed to men of capacity,\r\nor thwarted by what remained of public virtue in the country,\r\nhe found himself in conflict with weapons of which he knew\r\nnot the use; and his counsels were dangerous, and his administration\r\nunprosperous.  His only wisdom was the craft with which he\r\nmanaged weak or bad men, and his only virtue the courage with\r\nwhich he overawed timid ones.' Such counsellors, fatal to a\r\nmonarch, are full of peril to a republic.  Such men can only\r\nprosper in times of public corruption.\r\n\r\n\"General Butler has done, unless he has egregiously imposed\r\nupon us, two things well.  He out-blackguarded a New York\r\nmob in 1864, and with a United States army at his back, he\r\nkept down a rebel city in 1862.  Massachusetts is not likely\r\nsoon to stand in need of either of these processes.  But he\r\nnever has accomplished anything else of much importance when\r\nhis point could not be carried by sheer blustering.  The history\r\nof all his other attempts may be comprised in three words--\r\n_Swagger, quarrel, failure._\r\n\r\n\"Other men have aspired before now to the office of Governor\r\nof Massachusetts.  It is an honorable ambition.  They were\r\ncontent to leave their claims to be set forth by others, and\r\nwere glad to waive them if by so doing they could promote\r\nthe harmony of the party.  This man seeks nothing but his\r\nown selfish ends, utterly regardless of the wishes, the welfare,\r\nor the harmony of the great party to which he professes to\r\nbelong.  The people of Massachusetts have sometimes elected\r\nto this high office men who in some particulars are not deserving\r\nof respect.  But the people respected them, and chose them\r\nbecause they deemed them worthy, and the persons so chosen\r\nendeavored to deserve the public confidence.  This man, if\r\nhe is chosen at all, is to be chosen without having the respect\r\nof the men to whom he looks for support.  It would be harder\r\nto find a leading supporter of General Butler who will say\r\nthat he deems him honest, truthful, disinterested, or incapable\r\nof using power to gratify both his ambition and his revenge.\r\nThe men whom General Butler will beat are the men whom he\r\npersuades to support him.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning after his defeat in the State Convention each\r\nof the principal morning papers in Boston headed its account\r\nof the Convention with the words, \"Swagger, Quarrel, Failure.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler made no further reply by letter.  But he came\r\nto Worcester, where I dwelt, and addressed an enormous meeting\r\nin Mechanics Hall.  I suppose many more people than those\r\nthat got in were obliged to go away because the Hall would\r\nnot hold them.  The General devoted his speech largely to\r\na powerful and bitter attack upon me.  I replied at a meeting\r\nat the same place a few days after.  My speech ended with\r\nthe following sentences.  After describing the heroism of\r\nthe youth of Worcester in the battle with slavery and the\r\nbattle with Rebellion, I added:\r\n\r\n\"And now, after the war, another enemy, unarmed, but bringing\r\neven greater danger, menaces the Republic.  The battle with\r\ncorruption is the duty of the hour.  The blow which rebellion\r\naimed at the Nation's life you could ward off.  The wounds\r\nit inflicted are already in the process of cure.  But this\r\npoison, this rotting from the core, is far more dangerous\r\nto the Republic.  There is already danger that the operations\r\nof the Tweeds and Goulds in New York may be repeated on a\r\nmore gigantic scale at the National capital.  The mighty railroads\r\nto whom our public domain has been so lavishly granted, in\r\nsome cases I doubt not, wisely, afford infinite opportunity\r\nfor plunder and corruption.  All these are at the cost of\r\nthe labor of the country.  The increased tax falls in the\r\nend on the consumer.  With the waste of our public land are\r\ndiminished the resources of the laborer.  Following bad precedents\r\nCongress has itself been induced to set the pernicious example\r\nof which you have heard so much discussion.  (This referred\r\nto the measure known as the Salary Grab.)  The author of the\r\nmeasure tells you that he knew what he was doing, and if you\r\ndidn't like it you could vote against him.  Are you quite\r\nready to declare to the country that in this great contest\r\nwith extravagance and corruption, wherever the Republicans\r\nof the rest of the country may array themselves, the Republicans\r\nof Massachusetts fight under the banner of General Butler?\r\n\r\n\"You are doubtless familiar with Victor Hugo's description\r\nof the marine monster said to be found in the vicinity of\r\nthe Channel islands, and known as the Devil Fish.  It is\r\napparently formed of an almost transparent jelly, colorless,\r\nalmost indistinguishable from the water which surrounds it,\r\narmed with long slender limbs, numerous as the feet of the\r\ncentipede, and strong in their grasp as hands of iron.  The\r\nbather in those waters habitually provides himself with a\r\nlong keen blade, which, when he finds himself encountered\r\nby one of these monsters, he elevates above his head in his\r\nextended right hand.  As the creature approaches, the bather\r\nfeels himself slowly enveloped in the powerful limbs which\r\ntwine about him, holding him in their iron grasp.  Suddenly\r\na head appears, and drawing itself nearer the animal seeks\r\nto fasten its mouth upon the lips of the victim and deprive\r\nhim of life.  At this moment the bather strikes with his knife\r\ninto the head of the monster.  Instantly the limbs relax their\r\nhold, the hideous creature slowly disappears, and the bather\r\nis left unharmed and safe.  Our Republic finds itself to-\r\nday assailed by a monster as dangerous, unpalpable, soft,\r\nhorrible but strong--strong as hands of iron.  The limbs of\r\nthis monster of Corruption have seized upon our noble Republic,\r\nbut at last there is a head coming in sight, and I think the\r\nRepublicans of Massachusetts are able to bear the knife and\r\nstrike the blow which will destroy its horrible life so that\r\nit shall fall powerless forever!\"\r\n\r\nThat closed the discussion so far as we were concerned for\r\nthat campaign.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Judge Hoar, who had been, very much against his will,\r\nelected to Congress from the Middlesex District declined a\r\nrenomination.  General Butler, who had been defeated at the\r\npolls in the Essex District two years before was thereupon\r\nnominated, having pledged himself to the Republicans that\r\nhe would abandon his fiat money doctrines in obedience to\r\nthe declared will of the people; a pledge which as stated\r\nabove he shamefully violated.  There was no expectation of\r\ndefeating him.  But some few Republicans who were unwilling\r\nto support him desired a candidate on whom to unite, and they\r\napplied to Judge Hoar.  He said he had no desire to go to\r\nCongress.  But he thought there ought to be a Republican candidate\r\nagainst Butler and that he had no right to ask another man\r\nto take a position from which he flinched himself, and accordingly\r\nhe was nominated.  But Butler was elected by a large majority.\r\n\r\nThat however was substantially the end of his relation with\r\nthe Republican Party.  After the Inauguration of President\r\nHayes he tried to have the public officers in his District\r\nwho had refused to support him removed.  On President Hayes's\r\nrefusal he left the Republican Party and became, a year or\r\ntwo after, the Democratic nominee for Governor for two or\r\nthree years and, as has been seen, was elected in 1883.  I\r\nof course supported the Republican candidate and made, I suppose,\r\nthirty or forty speeches in each of those years.  He had said\r\nin explaining and defending his fiat money scheme that the\r\nword \"fiat\" means \"let there be.\" God said \"fiat lux,\" \"let\r\nthere be light,\" and there was light.  He argued that fiat\r\nmoney was excellent from the very fact that it cost nothing\r\nand had no intrinsic value.  So if a bill were lost or destroyed\r\na new one could be supplied without cost.  He also said that\r\nit would stay in the country and would not be sunk in the\r\nmorasses of Asia, especially in China and India, where silver\r\nand gold were absorbed and never heard of in civilized nations\r\nafterward.  I quoted these sentences with the following comment:\r\n\"That, Fellow-citizens, is precisely the difference between\r\nOmnipotence and Humbug, between the Almighty and General Butler.\r\nGod said let there be light and there was light.  General\r\nButler says let there be money and there is--rags.  This is\r\nthe first time in our history that the American workingman\r\nhas been gravely asked to take for his wages money it costs\r\nnothing to make, that it is no loss to lose, that it is no\r\ngain to get, and that even a Chinaman won't touch.\" Butler\r\nwas very angry and answered, rather irrelevantly, as it seemed\r\nto me, by saying that I did not go to the War, to which I\r\nreplied as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I see that the Greenback candidate for Governor has seen\r\nfit to taunt some persons, including myself, who have ventured\r\nto exercise the privilege of free speech in this campaign,\r\nthat they did not go to the war; while he boasts that he not\r\nonly went to the war but hung a rebel.  Those persons who\r\ndid not go to the war may, perhaps, possess at least this\r\nadvantage, that they can form an impartial opinion of the\r\nmerits of those who did.  It is the pride and the honor of\r\nthis noble Commonwealth of ours, that of the hundred thousand\r\nbrave soldiers and sailors she sent to the war, there was\r\nbut one notorious braggart; there was but one capable of parading\r\nup and down the Commonwealth, vaunting that he had hung a\r\nman; exhibiting himself as the Jack Ketch of the rebellion.\r\nI bow reverently to the brave, modest, patriotic soldier,\r\nwho, without thought of personal gain, gave youth, health,\r\nlimb, life to save the country which he loved.  I am willing\r\nto abide by his opinion, and to yield to him every place of\r\nhonor and of office.  But to you, General Butler, whose military\r\ncareer is made up of the blunder and slaughter of Big Bethel;\r\nof the powder explosion at Fort Fisher; of the engineering\r\nat Dutch Gap; of the \"bottling-up\" at Bermuda Hundred; of\r\nthe trading with the rebels through the lines in North Carolina;\r\nof the scandals of New Orleans; to you, who were ordered by\r\nGeneral Grant to go home in disgrace; to you whose best service\r\nhad been, if you, too, had stayed at home, I have no such\r\ntribute to offer.  When Benedict Arnold taunts Jefferson that\r\nhe did not go into battle in the Revolution, when Aaron Burr\r\ntaunts John Adams with want of patriotism, then it will be\r\ntime for you to boast yourself over the men who performed\r\nthe duties of civil life during the Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nWe have had turbulent and exciting times in our State and\r\nNational politics before and since that day.  But I think\r\nthere has been nothing in Massachusetts, and so far as I am\r\naware there has seldom been anything in the country anywhere\r\nlike the years from 1869 until 1877, when General Butler's\r\npower was at its height.  You could hardly take up a morning\r\npaper without dreading that you should read of the removal\r\nfrom some position of honor of some brave honest soldier who\r\nhad deserved well of his country, and the substitution of\r\nsome disreputable person in his place.  All the dishonesty\r\nof the time seemed to be combined and rallied to his support.\r\nThree of his trusted lieutenants in different parts of the\r\nCommonwealth were convicted of crime and sent to the State\r\nPrison.  Another was detected in crime punishable by imprisonment\r\nin the State Prison, but escaped prosecution by a compromise.\r\nStill another was compelled to flee the country for a series\r\nof forgeries, finding refuge in a South American State with\r\nwhich we had no treaty of extradition.  Still another was\r\nindicted for frauds which wrecked a National bank, and escaped\r\nconviction by a technicality.  Still another was compelled\r\nto flee from the Commonwealth by the detection of some notorious\r\nfrauds.  And now more recently, in 1898, another has been\r\narrested, a fugitive from justice, and brought back to Massachusetts,\r\nhaving wrecked two banks and embezzled their funds.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1883 General Butler was a candidate for\r\nreelection.  He was so confident that he had prepared his\r\ngrounds for a magnificent illumination.  But he was signally\r\ndefeated.  I took a leading part in the campaign.  I give\r\nthe following extract from my speech at Worcester:\r\n\r\n\"But we are thinking to-night of the matter of electing a\r\nGovernor.  Character is more important than opinion; good\r\nname to the State, as to the citizen, is better than riches.\r\nI suppose it is true of each one of you as of myself that\r\namong his chief comforts and pleasures in life is his pride\r\nin being a Massachusetts citizen.  The honor and good fame\r\nof our beloved State is far above any question of party.  I\r\nthink I do you no more than justice when I declare that you\r\nlament as much as I do the personal character of the contest\r\nwhich is upon us.  It has never been the habit of Republicans\r\nto deal in personalities.  The Republican press and the Republican\r\nplatform in Massachusetts has been singularly free from these\r\nthings.  What Democratic candidate can be named other than\r\nthe present Governor to whom the Republicans have not delighted\r\nto pay the respect due to honorable and respected opponents.\r\nHave Gaston or Thompson or either Adams or Hancock or any\r\nof their candidates for Congress, anything to complain of\r\nin this respect? If we deal differently with General Butler,\r\nit is because the difference is in him.  We have selected\r\nour own candidate on a very simple principle.  In determining\r\non whom we would confer the title, His Excellency, we have\r\nsought a man who represented in his own person our standard\r\nof excellence.  We sought a man whom the fathers and mothers\r\nof the Commonwealth would be willing to hold up to their children\r\nfor imitation.  We sought a man, tried and proved in important\r\npublic trusts, faithful, sincere, upright, downright, who\r\nwould continue and maintain the honored line of Massachusetts\r\nGovernors.  We have found such a man in George D. Robinson.\r\nI will sum up what I have to say of Mr. Robinson by saying\r\nthat he is in every respect the reverse of his antagonist.\r\nWe are told that we must not discuss the record of the candidate\r\nof our antagonists before his election last year.  That was\r\nall condoned.  I do not concede for myself that truth is necessarily\r\ndetermined by majorities.  I have a high respect for the people,\r\nbut they do not change men's characters by their votes.  But,\r\nbe it so, let bygones be bygones.  Let us concede that the\r\ncareer of our present governor as citizen and soldier and\r\nstatesman furnishes a lofty example of every virtue under\r\nheaven.  Let us admit that it was love of liberty that advocated\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law in the old Democratic days; that it\r\nwas fidelity that was sent to Charleston, to vote for Douglas,\r\nand voted fifty-seven times for Jefferson Davis; that it was\r\npatriotism of which Governor Andrew said in 1861: 'I am compelled\r\nto declare with great reluctance and regret that the whole\r\ncourse of proceedings under Major General Butler in this Commonwealth\r\nseems to have been designed and adopted to afford means to\r\npersons of bad character to make money unscrupulously;' that\r\nit was good generalship that caused the blunder and slaughter\r\nof Big Bethel; that it was skilful engineering that made the\r\ncanal at Dutch Gap a laughing-stock to the civilized world;\r\nthat it was a great strategist that was bottled up at Bermuda\r\nHundred; that it was courage that retreated from the uncaptured\r\nFort Fisher; that it was purity that caused the scandals of\r\nNew Orleans, and integrity that traded through the lines in\r\nNorth Carolina; that it was a great soldier that was ordered\r\nby General Grant to report at Lowell; that it was zeal for\r\nthe public service that defended the Sanborn Contracts; that\r\nit was modesty that has gone so often up and down the State\r\nblowing his own trumpet; that it was honesty that mingled\r\nthe funds of the Soldiers' Home with its own; that it was\r\ngood faith that sought to juggle the public creditor out of\r\nhis debt; that it was care for the poor and the working men\r\nthat sought to give our laborers rags for wages and our soldiers\r\nwaste paper for pensions; that it was a faithful representative\r\nthat promised the men of the Middlesex District that if he\r\nmight go once more to fight the Rebel brigadiers he would\r\nfaithfully represent their opinions on finance and then proposed\r\nthat marvellous scheme of fiat money, which he represented\r\nit would be no loss to lose and no gain to get, and that even\r\na Chinaman would not touch, so that the same constituency\r\ndemanded his resignation and 'resolved, that we warn the people\r\nof the Commonwealth, whose votes General Butler is now soliciting\r\nby promises to serve them faithfully, that his professions\r\nwhen seeking office have been found in our experience to be\r\neasily made and as easily repudiated when the time for redeeming\r\nthem came; that they are neither gold nor good paper, but\r\na kind of fiat currency, having no intrinsic value, cheap,\r\ndelusive, irredeemable and worthless;' that it was an honest\r\nDemocrat, of whom Mr. Avery, President of this year's Democratic\r\nConvention, declared that his promises and pledges could not be\r\ntrusted; that it was consistency which has belonged to every\r\nparty in turn.  We will put the issue of this election upon\r\nthe record of the year's administration.  He has shown an\r\nutter want of understanding of the true theory of the Constitution.\r\nThis is illustrated in his removal of Warden Earle.  He told\r\nhis friends at the prison that he made the removal because\r\nEarle would not obey his orders.  He had no more right to\r\ngive an order to Earle than to you or me.  The Governor and\r\nthe Council have the right to prescribe rules for the government\r\nof the prison--not the Governor.  The Board of Prison Commissioners\r\nhave the right to give directions to the Warden, but not the\r\nGovernor.  His telling Earle to obey his orders on pain of\r\ndismissal was as flagrant a violation of law and of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, as it was an injustice to\r\nas brave an officer, as honest a man as ever tied a sash around\r\nhis waist.  He traduced the Commonwealth in his vile Tewksbury\r\nspeech.  I believe every charge he made broke down on his\r\nown evidence or was thoroughly refuted.  But if the thing\r\nwere decent to do, it might be done decently.  Those of you\r\nwho have delighted to listen to the classic eloquence of Everett,\r\nto the lofty speech of Sumner, to the noble appeals of Andrew,\r\naye, to the sincere and manly utterances of Robinson, take\r\nthat speech and read it.  He insulted womanhood in the person\r\nof a defenceless girl.  He insulted purity by a speech so\r\ngross that the principal Democratic paper in Boston declares\r\nit unfit for circulation, and demands that it be suppressed.\r\nHe insulted every colored man in the State, when, in an unguarded\r\nmoment, speaking from his very soul, he called out: 'Give\r\nme the skin that came off the nigger.' He insulted the citizen\r\nsoldiers of Massachusetts when he declared that they needed\r\nbut a word from him to clean out the State House.  He insulted\r\nthe common school system of Massachusetts when he said that\r\nif his witness were a person of immoral character, the school\r\nsystem was responsible.  He insulted the whole Commonwealth\r\nin trying to cast upon the foul imputation that she was inhuman\r\nand indifferent to her poor and unfortunate, and intimated\r\nthat the tanning of human skins was a recognized Massachusetts\r\nindustry.  Another insult is the menace of fraud that comes\r\nfrom Boston.  The law requires the appointment of election\r\nofficers, to be chosen equally from the two great parties,\r\nand every mayor of Boston, Republican and Democrat alike,\r\nPierce, Gaston and Green, have fairly and honorably discharged\r\ntheir duty.  It is one of the most important trusts that can\r\nbe imposed upon a public official, to guard the purity of\r\nthe vote of their fellow citizens.  The Republican Committee\r\nthis year submitted its lists and the names upon them were\r\nchanged, and other men substituted, Butler men, Democrats\r\nand criminals, all charged to the Republican account.  Our\r\nneighbor, Judge Nelson, a few years ago, tried at the bar\r\nof his court a man whom Governor Butler defended.  He was\r\nconvicted, sentenced and went to jail.  He is now out of prison,\r\nand has been substituted for a Republican, probably by the\r\ninfluence of his former counsel, to count the ballots of the\r\ncitizens of Boston.  You have heard of such proceedings in\r\nother States, but never in Massachusetts.  Unless the people\r\nof this Commonwealth rise in their might and crush out this\r\nattempted fraud, they will have at the mouth of the Charles\r\nRiver another New York, with its frauds, Tweed rings and scandals.\"\r\n\r\nHe answered that by an attack on the memory of my father who\r\nhad died more than twenty-five years before.  Thereupon the\r\ncontroversy, so far as it had anything personal in it, ended.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the year when General Butler was Governor\r\nI was elected President of the Harvard Alumni Association.\r\nIt was the custom of the College to invite the Governor to\r\nthe dinner of the Alumni on Commencement day as the guest\r\nof the University and to confer upon him the degree of Doctor\r\nof Laws.  It would have been my duty to preside at the dinner\r\nand to walk with him at the head of the procession, to have\r\nhim seated by my side at the table, and to extend to him the\r\ncourtesies of the University.  I hardly knew what I ought\r\nto do.  I must either walk with him and sit by his side in\r\nsilence or with a formal and constrained courtesy which would\r\nin itself be almost an affront, or on the other hand, I must\r\ntake his hand, salute him with cordiality as becomes a host\r\non a great occasion in dealing with a distinguished guest,\r\nand converse with him as I should have conversed with other\r\npersons occupying his high place.  It did not seem to me that\r\nI ought to do either, especially in the case of a man whose\r\noffence had not been merely against me, but who had made a\r\ngross and unfounded attack upon the memory of my father, and\r\nof whose personal and public character I entertained the opinion\r\nI had so often publicly expressed.  Accordingly I declined\r\nto accept the office of President.  My place was filled by\r\nJoseph H. Choate, who discharged the duty, of course, very\r\nmuch better than I could have done it.\r\n\r\nMr. James F. Rhodes in his able and most impartial history\r\nof the United States, speaking of the events of the summer\r\nof 1864 and the disintegrating and discouraging condition\r\nof the Army of the Potomac, says:\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances seemed to indicate the bitterness of disappointment\r\nat the failure of the high hopes and expectations which filled\r\nthe soul of Grant when he crossed the Rapidan.  It was commonly\r\nbelieved in the Army that his misfortune had driven him again\r\nto drink, and on this account and others Butler with crafty\r\nmethod acquired a hold on him which prevented him from acting\r\nfor the best interests of the service.  It is not a grateful\r\ntask to relate the story of Butler using Grant as a tool to\r\naccomplish his own ends.  The picture of such a relation between\r\nthe two is repulsive, but it may be fraught with instruction\r\nas men of the type of Butler are never absent from our political\r\nlife.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Rhodes, \"History,\" Vol. 4, p. 493.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n\"Butler had some hold on the Commander of the Armies of the\r\nUnited States and in the interview of July 9th showed his\r\nhand.\"*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Rhodes, Ibid., Vol. 4, p.495.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nI do not suppose the secret of the hold which General Butler\r\nhad upon General Grant will ever be disclosed.  Butler boasted\r\nin the lobby of the House of Representatives that Grant would\r\nnot dare to refuse any request of his because he had in his\r\npossession affidavits by which he could prove that Grant had\r\nbeen drunk on seven different occasions.  This statement was\r\nrepeated to Grant by a member of the House who told me of\r\nthe conversation.  Grant replied without manifesting any indignation,\r\nor belief or disbelief in the story: \"I have refused his requests\r\nseveral times.\" In the case of almost any other person than\r\nPresident Grant such an answer would have been a confession\r\nof the charge.  But it ought not to be so taken in his case.\r\nUnless he desired to take into his full confidence the person\r\nwho was speaking to him he was in the habit of receiving most\r\nimportant communications with entire silence or with some\r\nsimple sentence which indicated his purpose to drop the subject.\r\nMy own belief is that at some time during the War, or before\r\nthe War in times of discouragement Grant may have been in\r\nthe habit of drinking freely and may at some time have done\r\nso to excess.  During the whole time of his Presidency I had\r\na good opportunity to observe him in personal intercourse.\r\nI was familiar with many men who were constantly in his company\r\nat all hours of the day and often far into the night.  They\r\nassured me that there was no foundation for any imputation\r\nthat he was in the habit of drinking to excess then.  If at\r\nany time he had formed such a habit he had put it under his\r\nfeet.  For that I think he is entitled to greater honor than\r\nif he had never yielded to temptation.  My explanation of\r\nButler's influence over Grant is to some extent conjecture.\r\nBut I believe Grant thought him a powerful political leader\r\nand that he was entitled to respect as representing the opinions\r\nof large numbers of men.  Beside that Butler had a great\r\ninfluence over some ambitious men who were his confederates\r\nand over some timid men who were afraid of him.  Their influence\r\nwith Grant was on Butler's side.  Then Grant was apt, as I\r\nhave said in another place, to sympathize with men who were\r\nbitterly attacked, especially men who were charged with dishonesty\r\nor corruption, because such charges were made against him.\r\nSo without undertaking to explain Butler's influence with\r\nGrant, I content myself with stating it and lamenting it.\r\nHe led Grant to make some very bad appointments in Massachusetts\r\nwhich were totally repugnant to the feeling of her people.\r\nBut for those appointments, in my opinion, the strong objection\r\nfelt by her people to giving any President of the United States\r\na third term would not have prevented her supporting him for\r\nrenomination in 1880, a support which would have insured his\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAfter President Hayes came into power General Butler tested\r\nthe President's willingness to permit him to control the patronage\r\nof Massachusetts.  He demanded the appointment of a man recommended\r\nby him to the office of Postmaster at Methuen.  The term had\r\nexpired.  President Hayes carefully examined the matter in\r\nperson, got a list of the principal patrons of the office,\r\nand compared it with the petitions.  He determined to reappoint\r\nthe incumbent, who was an excellent officer, and a Republican\r\nwho had refused to vote for General Butler.  The man whom\r\nGeneral Butler recommended had lost a leg in the War.  He\r\nhad an artificial limb so well made that many people, even\r\nthose who worked in the same shop with him, did not know\r\nthat he had lost his leg.  Butler went before the Senate\r\nCommittee on Post Offices to get them to reject President\r\nHayes's nominee, taking his own candidate with him.  He had\r\nthe man leave off his artificial leg and come on crutches\r\nto get greater sympathy.  He made an earnest and angry speech\r\nbefore the Committee attacking President Hayes.  But he made\r\nno impression, and the old Postmaster was confirmed and reappointed.\r\nThereupon Butler left the Republican party, first declaring\r\nhimself an Independent and attempting in that capacity to\r\nget elected as Governor of the State.  Failing in that he\r\navowed himself a Democrat, and was, as has been already said,\r\nelected by the Democrats in the fall of 1882.  This transaction\r\nterminated his relation to the Republican Party, and his defeat\r\nfor Governor terminated his political life with the exception\r\nthat he was the Greenback candidate for the Presidency in\r\n1884.  But he received little support.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nBELKNAP IMPEACHMENT\r\n\r\nMarch 3, 1876, a message was sent to the Senate from the\r\nHouse of Representatives, impeaching General Belknap, the\r\nSecretary of War.  He was charged with having received corruptly\r\na large sum of money, payable in quarterly instalments, for\r\nthe appointment of a Post Trader, an officer appointed by\r\nthe Secretary of War.  This was a very lucrative position,\r\nthe profits of which depended very largely upon the Secretary.\r\nI was chosen one of the Managers of the Impeachment by the\r\nHouse.  There was no serious question of the guilt of the\r\nSecretary.  But he resigned, and his resignation was accepted,\r\nafter the discovery of his misconduct, before the proceedings\r\nof impeachment were inaugurated.  The whole struggle was over\r\nthe question of the Constitutional right of the Senate to\r\nconvict a public officer on impeachment proceedings instituted\r\nafter he had left office.  Upon that question I made a careful\r\nand elaborate argument.  A majority of the Senate (37 to 25)\r\nwere for sustaining the proceedings.  But the Senators who\r\nthought the Senate had no jurisdiction to enter a judgment\r\nof guilty when the proceedings were commenced after the person\r\nleft office, deemed themselves constrained to vote Not Guilty\r\nas the only mode of giving that opinion effect.\r\n\r\nSo General Belknap was acquitted for the want of the two-\r\nthirds vote for his conviction.  Every Democrat voted for\r\nconviction except Mr. Eaton of Connecticut.  The following\r\nRepublicans voted for conviction:  Booth, Cameron of Pennsylvania,\r\nDawes, Edmunds, Hitchcock, Mitchell, Morrill, Oglesby, Robertson,\r\nSargent, Sherman, and Wadleigh.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that the Senators who voted for\r\nacquittal were not, perhaps unconsciously, influenced by the\r\ndesire to shield a political associate from punishment.  The\r\npower to impeach public officers after leaving office had been\r\nexercised in England from time immemorial.  It is well settled\r\nthat when in the Constitution or legislation of the United\r\nStates a term of English law is used, that the meaning customarily\r\ngiven to the term in English jurisprudence is to ascribed\r\nto it here.\r\n\r\nThe history of this clause as found in the proceedings of\r\nthe Convention that framed the Constitution, makes very clear\r\nthe understanding of that body.  They first inserted the words:\r\n\"The Senate of the United States shall have power to try all\r\nimpeachments, but no person shall be convicted without the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds of the members present, which in\r\ncase of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal\r\nfrom office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office\r\nof trust and profit under the United States.\" The framers\r\nof the Constitution regarded the power of impeachment as absolutely\r\nessential to the working of the Government.\r\n\r\nThat clearly gave the two Houses of Congress the common law\r\npowers of impeachment, as exercised by Parliament.  At a later\r\ntime there was added:  \"The Vice-President and all civil officers\r\nof the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment\r\nand conviction.\"  That was added as a limitation on the tenure\r\nof office.  It seems incredible that they should have intended,\r\nwithout debate or division, to wholly change and so greatly\r\nlimit and narrow the clause previously adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that impeachment and removal from office will\r\nbe in many cases an insignificant and unimportant part of\r\nthe remedy as compared with perpetual disqualification from\r\nholding office.  It seems incredible that it could ever have\r\nbeen intended that this judgment of perpetual disqualification\r\nto hold office could only be rendered when the defendant is\r\nwilling, and can be avoided by his voluntary resignation.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution were very skilful Constitutional\r\nmechanics.  I am satisfied that the opinion of the majority\r\nof the Senate will prevail hereafter, unless the case where\r\nthe question shall come up be, like that of Belknap, strongly\r\naffected by party feeling.\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe said:  \"The right of impeachment and of trial\r\nby the Legislature is the mainspring of the great machine\r\nof government.  It is the pivot on which it turns.  If preserved\r\nin full vigor, and exercised with perfect integrity, every\r\nbranch will perform its duty.\"\r\n\r\nI received a good many letters expressing approval of my\r\nargument.  Perhaps, without inordinate vanity, I may be permitted\r\nto preserve those which follow.  The approval of my honored\r\nand beloved instructor, Judge Thomas, gave me special satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI am led to publish these letters partly because I think\r\nthe opinion of the writers on the question is worth preserving\r\nfor future reference, but chiefly, I believe, from what I\r\nhope will be deemed a pardonable vanity.  Mr. Sumner, in\r\nediting the thirteen volumes of his speeches, has given in\r\nregard to all of them, letters from friends and correspondents,\r\nexpressing his approval.  I do not suppose it would ever have\r\noccurred to Daniel Webster to publish similar certificates\r\nas to any speech or act of his.\r\n\r\nFROM GEORGE S. BOUTWELL, GOVERNOR; SECRETARY OF THE\r\n  U.

Hoar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\nELECTORAL COMMISSION\r\n\r\nWhen the Presidential election of 1876 was over both sides\r\nclaimed the victory.  When the certificates of the result\r\nin the different States reached the President of the Senate,\r\nin accordance with the requirement of the Constitution and\r\nthe law, it turned out that there was one majority for Hayes\r\nand Wheeler, upon the face of the returns, if the returns\r\nfrom the State of Oregon were construed in accordance with\r\nthe Republican claim.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Oregon gave a transcript of the record and\r\ndeclared his opinion that it showed one of the lawful electors\r\nto have voted for Mr. Tilden.  That would have given one majority\r\nfor Tilden.  The Republicans claimed that upon the record\r\nthe election showed that all the Republican candidates for\r\nelector had been chosen in Oregon, and that they had all voted\r\nfor Hayes and Wheeler.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats declared that the boards authorized to ascertain\r\nand return the result of the election for Presidential electors\r\nin South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana had corruptly and\r\nunlawfully rejected votes that ought to be counted for them,\r\nand counted votes for the Republicans that ought not to be\r\nso counted; and had in that way changed the result which,\r\nif it had been correctly ascertained and reported, would have\r\nshown a Democratic majority in those three States.\r\n\r\nThe country was deeply excited.  Threats of civil war were\r\nheard in many quarters.  When I went to Washington for the\r\nsession of December, 1876, while I did not believe there would\r\nbe a civil war, and supposed there would be some method of\r\nescape devised, I confess I saw no such method.  I now believe\r\nthat but for the bitter experience of a few years before,\r\nwith its terrible lesson, there would have been a resort to\r\narms.  It would have been a worse civil war than that of the\r\nRebellion, because the country would have been divided not\r\nby sections, but by parties.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have related elsewhere, a majority in Congress\r\nagreed to submit the question to a Commission composed of\r\nfive Senators, five Representatives, and five Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court, who, proceeding in accordance with an ingenious\r\nand skilfully devised mechanism, were to determine the case.\r\n\r\nI believe that as time goes on, the great self-restraint of\r\nthe American people in dealing with the momentous peril of\r\n1877, and the constructive ability which created the simple\r\nbut perfect mechanism of the Electoral Commission, will receive,\r\nas they deserve, the admiration of mankind.  There was at\r\nthe time, as would be expected, some anger and disappointment\r\nat the result.  Occasionally some bigot who can find nothing\r\nbut evil in the history and life of his country, generally\r\nsome recluse who has little knowledge of affairs, charges\r\nthe Commission with having wickedly deprived the majority\r\nof the people of the fruits of an honest and lawful victory.\r\nBut, in general, wherever I go I find that intelligent men\r\nof both parties are satisfied with the righteousness of the\r\ndecision, and admit that a different judgment would have wrought\r\nthe destruction of the Republic.\r\n\r\nWhen the decision of the Electoral Commission was accepted\r\nevery Democratic vote in the two Houses was against it, and\r\nevery Republican vote, save two, given in its favor.  Of these\r\ntwo, one shortly afterward left the Republican party and became\r\na bitter and angry Democrat.  The other, a most admirable\r\nand excellent college president, told me that he thought the\r\nCommission were technically right.  But he thought it better\r\nfor the effect on the country that the Democratic contention\r\nshould be sustained.  As if in a question of Constitutional\r\nproceeding, or rather a question of Constitutional power,\r\na determination could be technically right, and wrong upon\r\nthe merits.  If Congress, technically, that is according to\r\nthe mandate of the Constitution, had no power to decide the\r\nresult of the elections in the States, but that power was\r\ncommitted to State tribunals, how was it possible that any\r\nmember of either House of Congress, who had sworn to support\r\nthe Constitution, could usurp that power without being forsworn?\r\nBeside, it must be conceded by everybody to be utterly impossible\r\nthat the power of investigating disputed questions, as to\r\nthe choice of presidential electors by the States, should\r\nbe exercised by Congress.  There is no time for such an investigation\r\nby Congress.  It could only be done where a few precincts\r\nor votes were in dispute, in places near the seat of Government.\r\nIt would have been impossible to do it in time for the inauguration\r\nof the new President before the day of railroads and telegraphs\r\nfor any State in the country.  It would be impossible now\r\nto do it in parts of the country distant from the seat of\r\nGovernment.  The choice of electors takes place in November.\r\nThe result must be ascertained; the electors must meet; their\r\nvotes must be given; they must be certified to Congress; the\r\ncount must be made and result declared in Congress before\r\nthe 4th of March, a period of less than four months.  If there\r\nshould be a contest made in each of the forty-five States,\r\nan investigation might be demanded for every election precinct\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me clear that the power to judge of elections,\r\nreturns, and qualifications of presidential electors is not\r\ngiven by the Constitution to the two Houses of Congress, or\r\neither of them.  The power which it was deemed necessary\r\ncarefully to express in regard to their own members, it could\r\nhardly have been intended to bestow by implication from the\r\nright to be present when the certificates are opened, or even\r\nfrom the right to count the votes.  It is a power which it\r\nis utterly impracticable for Congress to exercise between\r\nthe time when the certificates are brought officially to its\r\nknowledge, and the time when it must be determined who has\r\nbeen chosen President.  Indeed, the distinguished counsel\r\nwho closed the case for the Tilden electors* conceded this\r\ndifficulty, to which his only answer was the suggestion that\r\nsuch an inquiry, like the right to the writ of _quo warranto,_\r\nmust be limited by discretion; in other words, that the two\r\nHouses may go as far into the inquiry, who were duly chosen\r\nelectors in any State, as they in their discretion think fit,\r\nor as time will permit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Mr. Charles O'Connor.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nThe statement of this position seems to be its refutation.\r\nWe are now discussing a question of jurisdiction.  In whom\r\nis the power to determine who have been appointed electors\r\n--in Congress or in the State?  It was gravely answered that\r\nit is in Congress when the State to be investigated is near\r\nthe seat of Government, or the inquiry to a few election precincts\r\nonly, but it is to be left to the State in other cases; that\r\nCongress may exert a power of inquiry into an election in\r\nDelaware which is impossible as to California, or may inquire\r\ninto one election district in New York, but cannot into twenty\r\nor a hundred.  This claim would never have arisen in any man's\r\nmind before the days of railroads and telegraphs.  Such investigations,\r\npossible only to the most limited extent now, would have been\r\nwholly impossible as to most of the States when the Constitution\r\nwas adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is asked, is there no remedy if the officers to whom the\r\nStates intrust the power of ascertaining and declaring the\r\nresult of the election act fraudulently or make mistakes?\r\nThe answer is that the Constitution of the United States\r\ngives no jurisdiction to Congress, when the certificates are\r\nopened and the votes are to be counted, to correct such mistakes\r\nor frauds.  A like question may be put as to every public\r\nauthority in which a final power of decision is lodged.  The\r\ndanger of mistake or fraud is surely quite as great if the\r\nfinal power be lodged in Congress, and the framers of the\r\nConstitution acted in nothing more wisely than in removing\r\nfrom Congress all power over the election of President.\r\n\r\nThere was never yet a political party in this country, or\r\nin England, which decided ordinary election cases, except\r\nin the clearest case, on other than party considerations.  In\r\nEngland and Canada it has been found necessary to commit to\r\nthe courts the consideration of election cases.  It is seldom\r\nthat either House of Congress has resisted partisan temptation\r\nin election cases, when one seat only was the prize of the\r\ncontest.  Is it likely that public virtue would withstand\r\nthe temptation of the Presidency?\r\n\r\nThe simple doctrine on which the Commission proceeded was\r\nthat the right to determine absolutely and finally who are\r\nthe duly chosen presidential electors is committed by the\r\nConstitution to the States.  The judgment of the tribunal\r\nestablished by the State for that purpose is conclusive on\r\nall the world.  Congress is only to count the votes of the\r\nofficials found by the State to have the right to cast them.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in the Oregon case the Commission departed\r\nfrom this principle, which they had acted upon in the case\r\nof South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana.  But there is not\r\nthe slightest truth in that suggestion.  In all of those\r\nthree cases the laws of the State had established a tribunal\r\nwith absolute right to determine all questions arising out of\r\nthe election.  The tribunal had the right to reject votes, or\r\ncount votes, according as they found the votes to be lawful\r\nor unlawful.  They had the right to reject returns from election\r\nprecincts where they found there could have been no lawful\r\nor orderly election by reason of violence, or where they found\r\nthe returns untrustworthy by reason of fraud.  This power\r\nthey exercised, and from it there was no appeal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the laws of Oregon did not provide for\r\na board of State canvassers, but provided that the Secretary\r\nof State should canvass the votes in the presence of the\r\nGovernor, and prepare duplicate lists thereof, which lists\r\nshould be singed by the Governor and Secretary.  These lists,\r\ncertified by the Secretary, were before the Electoral Commission,\r\nand disclosed the choice of Republican electors.  The Governor,\r\nhowever, undertook to declare his opinion of the result.  That\r\nopinion was that a Democrat was chosen who had received less\r\nthan a majority of the votes, or to use the phrase of the\r\nGovernor, \"received the highest number of votes cast for persons\r\neligible,\" because his Republican competitor was not eligible;\r\nand he, therefore, certified that the Democrat had the largest\r\nnumber of votes cast for persons eligible.  That Democratic\r\nelector proceeded then to hold a meeting, at which he was\r\nthe only person present, and as the two Republicans whom everybody\r\nadmitted were lawfully chosen, did not meet with him, he proceeded\r\nto fill two vacancies himself.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State made the canvass required by law,\r\nrecorded it and filed it in his office.  He made that canvass\r\nin the presence of the Governor.  He could not change it.\r\nHe could not tamper with it.  He had completed his official\r\nduty when he had completed it.  So that the Governor's certificate\r\nas to the effect of the election was of no more official character\r\nthan a like certificate of the Governor-General of India would\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nThere was no claim or pretence in any quarter that the Republicans\r\ndid not have a lawful majority of the votes cast for electors\r\nin Oregon.  The only claim was that one of the electors was\r\npostmaster, and that he did not lawfully resign before he\r\nwas chosen elector.  He was postmaster at the time of the\r\nelection, but resigned a few days later.  He was also chosen\r\nafter he had resigned to fill the vacancy in the Electoral\r\nCollege, if his ineligibility created a vacancy, in the regular\r\nform according to the laws of Oregon.  There was no question\r\nor pretence in any quarter that the will of the people of\r\nOregon was not given due effect by the judgment of the Electoral\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that there are any considerable number of\r\nintelligent persons in the country, now that the excitement\r\nof the time has gone by, who doubt that the will of the people\r\nof South Carolina and Florida and Louisiana was carried into\r\neffect by the judgment of the Commission; and that their judgment\r\nbaffled an unscrupulous conspiracy to deprive the majorities\r\nin those States of their lawful rights in the election because\r\nthose majorities were made up largely of negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\nFOUR NATIONAL CONVENTIONS\r\n1876\r\n\r\nIt has been my fortune to be a delegate from Massachusetts\r\nin four National Conventions for the nomination of President\r\nand Vice-President--those of 1876, 1880, 1884 and 1888.  In\r\nthe first I was a delegate from the Worcester district, which\r\nI then represented in Congress.  In the other three I was\r\nat the head of the delegation at large.  I presided over that\r\nof 1880.\r\n\r\nThe history of these conventions is of great interest.  It\r\nshows the rudeness of the mechanism by which the Chief Executive\r\nof this country is selected, and what apparently slight and\r\ntrivial matters frequently determine the choice.  As is well\r\nknown, the framers of the Constitution, after considering\r\nvery seriously the question of entrusting the power of choosing\r\nthe President to the Senate, determined to commit that function\r\nto electoral colleges, chosen in the several States in such\r\nmanner as their legislatures should determine, all the electors\r\nto give their votes on the same day.  It is generally stated\r\nthat the President and Vice-President cannot be from the same\r\nState.  That is not true.  The Constitutional provision is\r\nthat electors in their respective States shall vote by ballot\r\nfor President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall\r\nnot be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was intended that the choice of the President should not\r\nbe a direct act of the people.  It was to be committed to\r\nthe discretion of men selected for patriotism, wisdom and\r\nsobriety, and removed as far as might be from all the excitements\r\nof popular passion.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution further provides that no Senator or Representative,\r\nor person holding an office of trust or profit under the United\r\nStates, shall be appointed an elector.  It was undoubtedly\r\nthe chief object of this last provision to prevent the perpetuation\r\nof power in the same hands, or under the same influences,\r\nby removing the choice of President wholly from the control\r\nof persons wielding National authority.  In a considerable\r\nmeasure this purpose has been defeated.  The elector, in practice,\r\nis a mere agent or scribe.  He records and executes the will\r\nof the nominating convention of the party to which he belongs,\r\nin which the real power of selection is in fact lodged.  In\r\nthese conventions members of Congress, and holders of National\r\noffice, take frequently an active and influential share.  It\r\nis remarkable, however, how often the nominating conventions\r\nhave discarded the candidates who were favored by the holders\r\nof executive office or the two Houses of Congress.  And where\r\nsuch candidates have been nominated by the convention of either\r\nparty, they have often been defeated at the polls.  General\r\nHarrison, in 1840, was nominated instead of Webster or Clay,\r\nwho were the leaders of the Whig Party, and doubtless the\r\nfavorites at Washington.  In 1844, when Mr. Clay received\r\nthe Whig nomination, he was defeated by Mr. Polk, who had,\r\nI suppose, hardly been heard of as a candidate in political\r\ncircles at the Capital.  In 1848 the popular feeling again\r\ncompelled the nomination of a candidate, General Taylor, over\r\nthe favorite leaders at the Capital.  In 1852 Fillmore and\r\nWebster were both rejected by the Whigs for General Scott,\r\nand General Pierce was summoned from private life for the\r\nDemocratic nomination.  In 1860 Seward was rejected for Lincoln.\r\nAnd in 1876 Hayes, whose National service had consisted of\r\nbut one term in the House of Representatives, was chosen as\r\nthe result of a contest in which Blaine, Conkling, Morton\r\nand Bristow, distinguished National statesmen, were the defeated\r\ncompetitors.  So, in 1880, Garfield, who had not been much\r\nthought of in official circles, was selected as the result of a\r\nmighty struggle in which Grant and Blaine were the principal\r\nchampions, and in which Edmunds and Sherman, who had long\r\nbeen prominent in the Senate, were also candidates.\r\n\r\nRepublican National Conventions since the War of the Rebellion\r\nhave been embarrassed by another influence, which I hope will\r\ndisappear.  In many of the Southern States the Democratic\r\nParty consists almost entirely of whites who have possessed\r\nthemselves of the forces of government by criminal processes,\r\nwhich have been a reproach not only to this country, but to\r\ncivilization itself.  The Republicans, however numerous, and\r\nalthough having a majority of lawful voters in most of these\r\nStates, have been excluded from political power.  They have\r\nhowever, of course, had their full proportionate representation\r\nin the National Convention of the Republican Party.  Their\r\ndelegates have too often been persons who had no hope for\r\npolitical advancement in their own States, and without the\r\nambition to commend themselves to public favor by honorable\r\npublic service, of which that hope is the parent.  They have\r\nbeen, therefore, frequently either National office-holders\r\nwho may reasonably be supposed to be under the influence\r\nof the existing Administration, or likely to be governed\r\nby a hope of receiving a National office as a reward for\r\ntheir action in the convention; or persons who can be influenced\r\nin their actions by money.  This Southern contingent has been\r\nin several of our National Conventions an uncertain and an\r\nuntrustworthy force.\r\n\r\nThe Republican nominating convention of 1876 was held at Cincinnati\r\non June 14.  The delegates from Massachusetts were:\r\n\r\n_At Large._--E. R. Hoar, Richard H. Dana, Jr., Paul A. Chadbourne,\r\nJohn M. Forbes.\r\n\r\n_From Districts._--William T. Davis, Robert T. Davis, John\r\nE. Sandford, Edward L. Pierce, Henry D. Hyde, J. Felt Osgood,\r\nAlpheus Hardy, C. R. McLean, James M. Shute, James F. Dwinal,\r\nGeorge B. Loring, Henry Carter, William A. Russell, C. H.\r\nWaters, James Freeman Clarke, James Russell Lowell, A. J.\r\nBartholomew, George F. Hoar, James F. Moore, William Whiting,\r\nEdward Learned, S. R. Phillips.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for the nomination equalled in bitterness and\r\nin importance many of the contests between different political\r\nparties that had preceded it.  While the great majority of\r\nthe Republicans retained confidence in the personal integrity\r\nand patriotism of President Grant, it had become painfully\r\nmanifest that he was often an easy victim to the influence\r\nof unscrupulous and designing men.  Grant never lost his hold\r\nupon the hearts of the Northern people.  Wherever there was\r\na contest in any State for political supremacy the least worthy\r\nfaction frequently got his ear and his confidence.  He never\r\nwavered in his attachment to the doctrines of his party--\r\nprotection, sound principles of finance and currency, honesty\r\nin elections.  But the old political leaders, whom the people\r\nmost trusted, were more and more strangers to his presence,\r\nand ambitious and designing men, adventurers who had gone\r\nSouth to make fortunes by holding office, men interested in\r\njobs and contracts, thronged the ante-chambers of the White\r\nHouse.  The political scandals, always likely to follow a\r\ngreat war, seemed to be increasing rather than diminishing\r\nduring his second term of office.\r\n\r\nI never though that the proper way to put an end to this\r\nstate of things was to abandon what I deem sound political\r\nprinciples, or to abandon the party that was formed to establish\r\nthem.  I should as soon have thought of turning Tory because\r\nof like complaints in the Revolutionary War, or of asking\r\nGeorge III. to take us into favor again because of like scandals\r\nwhich existed during the Administrations of Washington and\r\nJohn Adams.  But I thought, in common with many others, that\r\na party of sound principles could be made and should be made\r\na party of pure politics.\r\n\r\nThe two divisions in the Republican Party, which I have indicated,\r\nmarshalled their forces for the struggle in the convention\r\nof 1876.  The friends of Mr. Blaine were generally those Republicans\r\nwho had been dissatisfied with the conduct of the Administration.\r\nThey embraced, also, the larger number of the enthusiastic\r\nyoung Republicans, who were attracted by Blaine's brilliant\r\nqualities, as were those who had come in contact with him\r\nby the marvellous personal charm of his delightful and gracious\r\nmanners.  Roscoe Conkling was regarded as the leader of the\r\nother party.  The House of Representatives, by an almost unanimous\r\nvote, had adopted the resolution declaring that it was contrary\r\nto sound principle to elect a President for a third term.\r\nSo General Grant himself was not a candidate.\r\n\r\nBut as the time for the convention drew near, there had been\r\nan investigation in the House of Representatives into the\r\naffairs of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad, which\r\nhad resulted in some uncomfortable revelations with reference\r\nto Mr. Blaine.  He was charged with having acquired stocks\r\nin railroads which were to be affected by National legislation,\r\neither without consideration or for a consideration far below\r\ntheir true value, and of having eagerly sought to acquire\r\nother similar stocks, the real consideration which he paid,\r\nor expected to pay, being the use of his official influence\r\nin behalf of these corporations.  This investigation, ordered\r\nby the Democratic House of Representatives, was conducted\r\nby a majority of the committee charged with it, in a spirit\r\nof bitter hostility.  The investigation was still in progress\r\nwhen the Republican Convention met.  The facts, which were\r\ndistorted and discolored in public report, impressed many\r\nexcellent persons unfavorably to Mr. Blaine, and a few with\r\na belief of his guilt.  They were used dexterously by his\r\npolitical opponents and by his rivals in his own party, and\r\nby some conspicuous persons who had, or thought they had,\r\npersonal grievances against him, to excite the public mind.\r\nOn the other hand, as is natural in such cases, the great\r\nbody of Mr. Blaine's friends clung all the closer to him\r\nfrom a belief that he was the object of unjust and malignant\r\nslander.\r\n\r\nI did not think it, under the circumstances, wise to nominate\r\nMr. Blaine, either in 1876 or later.  I believed then, and\r\nnow believe, that he would have been an admirable President\r\nof the United States.  But I did not think it wise to put\r\nat the head of a movement for reform and for purity of administration,\r\na man whose supporters must defend him against such charges,\r\nand who must admit that he had most unwisely of his own accord\r\nput himself into a position where such charges were not only\r\npossible, but plausible.  But I was exceedingly anxious that\r\na candidate should be found who would be not only agreeable\r\nto Mr. Blaine and his supporters, but whom, if possible, they\r\nshould have a large influence in selecting.\r\n\r\nSuch a candidate, it was hoped, might be found in Mr. Bristow.\r\nHe was a great favorite in his own State.  He was a man of\r\nspotless integrity and great ability.  He had been a Union\r\nsoldier.  He was from Kentucky, and his selection as a candidate\r\nwould remove the charge of sectionalism from the Republican\r\nParty, and tend to give it strength with the white people\r\nof the South.  He had made an admirable Attorney-General,\r\nand an admirable Secretary of the Treasury.  He had been appointed\r\nto the Cabinet by Grant.  He had not been long enough in public\r\nservice to have encountered the enmities which almost always\r\nattach themselves to men long in office, and he represented\r\nno clique or faction.  He was a man of clean hands and of\r\npure heart.  For a good while it seemed as if the rival aspirations\r\nof Blaine and Bristow might exist without ill-feeling, so\r\nthat when the time came, the supporters of either might easily\r\ngive their support to the other, or agree without difficulty\r\nin the support of some third person.  I gave a banquet at\r\nWormley's in the spring of 1876, which I hoped might have\r\nsome tendency toward this desired harmony.  There were about\r\nforty guests.  Mr. Blaine sat on my right hand as the guest\r\nof honor, and Mr. Bristow on the left.  They talked together,\r\nas I sat between them, during the whole evening in the most\r\nfriendly and delightful way, telling humorous anecdotes relating\r\nto their own campaigns, as pleasantly as if they had been\r\ndescribing the canvass of some third person whom they were\r\nboth supporting.  I do not believe there was at that time\r\nin the heart of either a tinge of anger against the other.\r\n\r\nBut as the contest went on, Mr. Blaine seems to have become\r\npossessed with a belief that the bitter public attacks upon\r\nhim were instigated by Bristow.  Some of the Kentucky papers\r\nhad been specially bitter.  The Republican Convention opened\r\nin Cincinnati, Wednesday, June 14.  The Sunday morning before\r\nMr. Blaine fell in a swoon on the steps of the church at the\r\ncorner of G and Tenth Streets in Washington.  He was carried\r\nto his house on Fifteenth Street.  Bristow was in his office\r\nin the Treasury Department when a friend called upon him,\r\nand gave him the news of Blaine's attack, and said: \"Would\r\nit not be well for you to go round and express your interest?\"\r\nBristow took his hat, and the two friends went together to\r\nMr. Blaine's house.\r\n\r\nAn occurrence took place there which satisfied them both\r\nthat the feeling against Bristow on the part of Mr. Blaine\r\nand his near friends was exceedingly strong and implacable.\r\nThe story was immediately telegraphed in cipher to Mr. Bristow's\r\nprincipal manager at Cincinnati, from whom I had it a day\r\nor two before committing it to paper.  The facts were communicated\r\nby him in confidence to members of the Kentucky delegation.\r\n\r\nOn the first six ballots the total number of votes cast was\r\n754.  Three hundred and seventy-eight were necessary for\r\na choice.  Mr. Blaine received votes varying from 285 on\r\nthe first ballot to 308 on the sixth.  On all these ballots, but\r\ntwo, Bristow had the second largest number, ranging from\r\n111 to 126.  On the first and second ballot he was led by\r\nMorton, who had 124 and 120 votes, and was closely followed\r\nby Conkling, whose highest vote was 99.  At the end of the\r\nsixth ballot it had become manifest that the opponents of\r\nBlaine, if they expected to succeed, must unite on a candidate.\r\nA portion of the Pennsylvania delegation had already voted\r\nfor Blaine, who was a native of that State.  Others had been\r\nheld in restraint from voting for him with difficulty, by\r\nthe influence of Don Cameron, chairman of the delegation and\r\na strong adherent of Grant.  The New York Conkling men and\r\nthe majority of the Pennsylvania delegation, led by Cameron,\r\ndetermined to cast their votes for Hayes, of Ohio, to prevent\r\nthe nomination of Blaine.  In doing that they were to unite\r\nwith their most earnest antagonists and give their support\r\nto a candidate who probably sympathized with them less than\r\nany other on the list.  It was manifest to the Kentucky delegation\r\nthat they must make their choice between Blaine and Hayes,\r\nand that their choice would decide the nomination.  They had\r\na hurried consultation and determined to vote unanimously\r\nfor Hayes.  The going over of Kentucky to Hayes was followed\r\nby the other States that had opposed Blaine.  Hayes had on\r\nthe final ballot 384 votes, Blaine 351, and there were 21\r\ncast for Bristow, which had been cast by States standing\r\nearlier in alphabetical order on the roll, who had cast their\r\nvotes before the stampede began.  If Kentucky had cast her\r\n24 votes for Blaine, he would have been nominated.  I was\r\ntold by the close friend of Bristow, of whom I have spoken,\r\nand I have no doubt he is right, that the Kentucky Republicans\r\nhad felt very kindly toward Blaine, and their action was determined\r\nby the knowledge of the transaction I have just related.  They\r\nthought that if this bitterness and anger and dislike of Mr.\r\nBristow existed in the mind of Mr. Blaine, it was hardly\r\nworth while for Bristow's friends and supporters to clothe\r\nhim with the Presidential office.  If Bristow had not visited\r\nBlaine's house that Sunday morning, Blaine would, in my opinion,\r\nhave been the Republican candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nWhat would have been the result if Mr. Blaine had been nominated\r\nin 1876, it is now idle to speculate.  I am satisfied, in\r\nlooking back, that I myself underrated his strength as a candidate.\r\nBut it seems likely that he would have had the votes of all\r\nthe States which President Hayes received, and would have\r\nbeen stronger than Hayes in New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes came to the Presidency under circumstances of great\r\ndifficulty and embarrassment.  He was in my judgment one of\r\nthe wisest, sincerest and most honest and patriotic men who\r\never held the office.\r\n\r\nBut President Hayes's Administration was embarrassed by the\r\ndisputes about his title.  The House of Representatives was\r\nagainst him in the first Congress of his term, and in the\r\nsecond Congress the Senate and House were in the hands of\r\nhis political opponents.  He also throughout the whole term\r\nhad to encounter the hardly disguised hostility of nearly\r\nall the great leaders of his own party in both Houses of Congress.\r\nConkling never spoke of him in public or private without a\r\nsneer.  I suppose he did not visit the White House or any\r\nDepartment during President Hayes's term.  Mr. Blaine was\r\nmuch disappointed by President Hayes's refusal to give Mr.\r\nFrye a place in the Cabinet, which he desired as a means of\r\ncomposing some incipient jealousies in Maine.  Hamlin, who\r\nwas a very influential Senator, was much disgusted by the\r\nPresident's inclination to reform the civil service.  This\r\nfeeling was largely shared by Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania,\r\nan able and patriotic man, who ruled the Republican Party\r\nin that State with a despotic hand, and had as little respect\r\nfor the doctrines of the civil service reformers as you might\r\nexpect from one of his Highland ancestors who ruled over the\r\nClan Cameron in the days of the Scotch Stuarts.  Cameron\r\nhad also a personal grievance, although I do not think that\r\nmade any difference in his feeling.  He had been proposed\r\nby the Pennsylvania delegation for the appointment to the\r\nEnglish Mission.  But the proposition had not been received\r\nwith favor by President Hayes.  Under these difficulties,\r\nit is greatly to his honor that so much of public good was\r\naccomplished in his time, and that he handed over the Government\r\nto a Republican successor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\nFOUR NATIONAL CONVENTIONS\r\n1880\r\n\r\nAs the time approached for the Republican Convention of 1880,\r\nit had become clear that it would witness a mighty struggle.\r\nConkling, Don Cameron, who had succeeded to his father's power\r\nin Pennsylvania, and Logan, of Illinois, the most distinguished\r\nvolunteer soldier of the war, and a great favorite with his\r\nold comrades, were the most conspicuous leaders of the party\r\nwho desired to restore the old Grant regime.  They were seconded\r\nby Howe, formerly Senator from Wisconsin and later Postmaster-\r\nGeneral under President Arthur, Creswell, of Maryland, Postmaster-\r\nGeneral in Grant's first term, Governor Boutwell, of Massachusetts,\r\nwho had a very distinguished public career as Governor, member\r\nof the House of Representatives, Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nand Senator.  They selected as their candidate their old chieftain,\r\nGeneral Grant.  He was strong not only in the powerful support\r\nof these great political leaders, but in the solid confidence\r\nof the great Methodist denomination to which he belonged,\r\nin the love of the old soldiers, in the memory of his great\r\npublic service, both in war and peace, and the general respect\r\nof the whole American people.  Against this was the unwritten,\r\nbut well-understood, rule of action by which the people had\r\nbeen governed since the time of Washington, that no person\r\nshould be elected to the office of President for more than\r\ntwo terms.  Against him, also, was the feeling that his judgment,\r\nwhich had been sound and unerring in the selection of fit\r\nmen for good military service, was very much at fault in choosing\r\nmen in whom he should confide in civil affairs.  There was\r\na further feeling that the influence of unworthy politicians,\r\nwhich had been powerful with him during his second term, would\r\nbe more powerful if he should go back to the Presidency with\r\ntheir aid.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine's old popularity had been increased in the four\r\nyears since his former defeat.  Many people believed that\r\nhe had been not only unjustly but cruelly treated, and were\r\neager to record their verdict of acquittal from the malignant\r\ncharges which had been made against him since 1876.  There\r\nwas a third class, of whom I was one, who felt that it would\r\nbe unwise to nominate either General Grant or Mr. Blaine.\r\nWhile they had a great respect for the character of Grant,\r\nthey dreaded the influences which would be sure to surround\r\nhim, if he should come to the Presidency again.  While they\r\nhad the kindliest feeling for Mr. Blaine and shared the public\r\nindignation at the character of the attacks of which he had\r\nbeen the victim, they did not like to have a candidate who\r\nwould be so handicapped.  Mr. Blaine's own imprudence had\r\nunquestionably given an opportunity and a plausibility to\r\nthese slanders.  They thought, also, that the nomination of\r\neither Grant or Blaine would create a feeling of anger and\r\ndisappointment in the supporters of the defeated candidate,\r\nwhich would seriously endanger the election.  They looked\r\nabout, therefore, for a person who might not be obnoxious\r\nto either the Blaine men or the Grant men, and found such\r\na person in Mr. Edmunds of Vermont.  He was a man of ability\r\nand long public service.  He was not a person calculated to\r\ninspire much popular enthusiasm, but answered very well as\r\na standard-bearer, although his supporters were ready to transfer\r\ntheir support to another candidate, other than Blaine or Grant,\r\non whom a majority of the Convention should be brought to\r\nunite.  Mr. Sherman had also a considerable body of supporters\r\nwho respected him for his eminent talents and long and valuable\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had a peculiarly strong hold on the Republicans\r\nof Massachusetts.  They shared with all patriotic men throughout\r\nthe country a profound gratitude for his illustrious military\r\nservices.  They had been impressed by a feeling of great respect\r\nfor his personal qualities. The modesty which led him to refuse\r\nto enter Richmond in triumph at the close of the war; the\r\nsimplicity of his behavior; the magnanimity which led him\r\nto claim so little praise for himself and give so much of\r\nthe credit to which he was entitled to Sheridan and Sherman,\r\nand others of his military associates; his incorruptible personal\r\nhonesty; his soundness and firmness in dealing with all questions\r\naffecting the public credit, the integrity of the currency,\r\nand the rights of citizenship, had endeared him to the people\r\nof a Commonwealth which ever valued such traits in her public\r\nmen.  The Methodist denomination, always large in Massachusetts\r\nand powerful in her Republican councils, was proud that this\r\nstatesman and warrior was of its fold.  As the time for the\r\nconvention approached, four ex-Governors, men of great personal\r\ninfluence, leaders in the Republican Party, yet of highly\r\ndifferent character, who represented very different shades\r\nof Republican opinion--Boutwell, Bullock, Claflin and Rice--\r\ndeclared themselves in favor of nominating him again.  Nothing\r\ncould have prevented his carrying Massachusetts as by a great\r\nwave, but the fact that he had been, in his second term, subject\r\nto a most unworthy influence in the matter of appointments\r\nto public office.  The whole National executive patronage\r\nin Massachusetts seemed given up to advancing the personal\r\nfortunes of General Butler.  Brave soldiers, honored Republicans,\r\nwere turned out of post-offices, to be replaced by incompetent\r\nand dishonorable adventurers, odious in the neighborhoods\r\nfrom which they came, to please this ambitious and unscrupulous\r\nman.  This excited a deep indignation which culminated when\r\nWilliam A. Simmons was made Collector of Boston.  No personal\r\nrespect for General Grant could induce the Massachusetts Republicans\r\nto run the risk of having again a President who was subjected\r\nto personal influences like these.  But for the appointment\r\nof Simmons as the principal Federal officer in Massachusetts,\r\nI think she would have supported Grant for a third term.  The\r\nEdmunds movement would never have been made, and his nomination\r\nat Chicago would have been certain.\r\n\r\nThe State Convention passed resolutions in favor of Mr. Edmunds,\r\nand elected as Delegates-at-Large, George F. Hoar, Worcester;\r\nCharles B. Codman, Boston; John E. Sanford, Taunton; and\r\nJulius H. Seelye, Amherst.\r\n\r\nThe District Delegates were:  Charles W. Clifford, New Bedford;\r\nAzariah Eldridge, Yarmouth; William C. Lovering, Taunton;\r\nF. A. Hobart, Braintree; Phineas Pierce, Boston; Choate Burnham,\r\nBoston; Eustice C. Fitz, Chelsea; Daniel Russell, Melrose;\r\nDudley Porter, Haverhill; N. A. Horton, Salem; George S.\r\nBoutwell, Groton; George A. Marden, Lowell; R. M. Morse,\r\nJr., Boston; George W. Johnson, Milford; W. S. B. Hopkins,\r\nWorcester; William Knowlton, Upton; Alpheus Harding, Athol;\r\nTimothy Merrick, Holyoke; Wellington Smith, Lee; M. B. Whitney,\r\nWestfield.\r\n\r\nOf these, three were in favor of Grant, namely, Boutwell,\r\nEldridge, Marden; two were in favor of Sherman, and one for\r\nWashburn.\r\n\r\nThe others voted for Mr. Edmunds in the beginning, meaning\r\nto defeat both Grant and Blaine if they could, and were ready\r\nto agree on any man of respectable character and capacity\r\nby whom that defeat could be accomplished.\r\n\r\nGeorge F. Edmunds had a high reputation in the country as\r\nan able lawyer, and a faithful and independent Senator.  He\r\nhad unquestionably rendered great public service in the Senate.\r\nIf elected, I believe he would have administered the Presidency\r\non the principles which a large majority of the people of\r\nMassachusetts hold.  He was an excellent debater.  He was\r\nvery fond of criticising and objecting to what was proposed\r\nby other men.  He seemed never so happy as when in opposition\r\nto the majority of his associates.  But he possessed what\r\npersons of that temper commonly lack, great capacity for constructive\r\nstatesmanship.  Any measure of which he was the author would\r\nbe likely to accomplish its purpose, and to stand fire.\r\n\r\nDavid Davis, who was President pro tempore of the Senate,\r\nused to say he could always compel Edmunds to vote in the\r\nnegative on any question by putting the question in the old\r\nNew England fashion, \"Contrary-minded will say no,\" for Edmunds\r\nwas always contrary-minded.  I once told him, borrowing a\r\nsaying of an Englishman, that if George Edmunds were the only\r\nman in the world, George would object to everything Edmunds\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the Massachusetts Convention of 1880, when\r\nthe convention passed resolutions, proposing Edmunds as a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency, and placing me first on the\r\ndelegation at large, Edmunds came to me and said, I have no\r\ndoubt with absolute sincerity:  \"I have seen the proceedings\r\nof your convention yesterday.  If I know myself, I have no\r\ndesire to be President of the United States.  I do not think\r\nI am fit for it, and if I were, I should much prefer my present\r\nservice as Senator.  I would say so in a public letter, but\r\nI suppose the chances of my nomination are so slight that\r\nit might seem ridiculous to decline.\" I said: \"But, Edmunds,\r\njust think of the fun you would have vetoing bills.\" He smiled,\r\nand his countenance beamed all over with satisfaction at the\r\nidea, and he replied, with great feeling: \"Well, that would\r\nbe good fun.\"\r\n\r\nSo while, as I have said, the Massachusetts delegates, most\r\nof them, supported Mr. Edmunds as a person likely to hold\r\nsome votes until the opposition to Grant might be concentrated\r\non some other candidate to be agreed on as the proceedings\r\nof the convention went on, and while I think he would have\r\nmade an excellent President if he had been chosen, his candidacy\r\nwas never a very strong one.\r\n\r\nThis convention was menaced by a very serious peril.  A plan\r\nwas devised which, if it had been successful, would, in my\r\njudgment, have caused a rupture in the convention and the\r\ndefeat of the Republican Party in the election.  The Chairman\r\nof the Republican National Committee was Don Cameron of Pennsylvania,\r\nthen and for some years afterward a Senator of the United\r\nStates from that State.  He was an ardent supporter of President\r\nGrant and had been Secretary of War in his Cabinet, as his\r\nfather had been in the Cabinet of President Lincoln.  Like\r\nhis father before him, he had ruled the Republican Party of\r\nPennsylvania with a strong hand.  He was not given to much\r\nspeaking.  He was an admirable executive officer, self-reliant,\r\npowerful, courageous and enterprising, with little respect\r\nfor the discontent of subordinates.  He was supported by a\r\nmajority of the delegates from Pennsylvania, although Blaine,\r\nwho was a native of that State, had a large following there.\r\nThe New York delegation was headed by Roscoe Conkling, who\r\nhad great influence over Grant when he was President, and\r\nexpected to retain that influence if he became President\r\nagain.  The Maryland delegation was headed by J. A. J. Creswell,\r\nwho had been Postmaster-General more than five years in Grant's\r\ntwo Administrations.  On the Massachusetts delegation, as\r\nI have said, was Governor Boutwell, Grant's Secretary of the\r\nTreasury during nearly the whole of his first term, and on\r\nthat from Illinois John A. Logan.  These men had a large following\r\nover the whole country.  There were three hundred and eight\r\npersons in the convention who could be counted on to support\r\nGrant from beginning to end, and about a dozen more were exceedingly\r\ndisposed to his candidacy.  The State Conventions of the\r\nthree largest and most powerful States, New York, Pennsylvania\r\nand Illinois, and possibly one or two others, that I do not\r\nnow remember, had instructed their delegates to vote as a\r\nunit for the candidate who should be agreed upon by the majority.\r\nGrant had a majority in each of these States.  But there was\r\na minority of 18 in Illinois, 26 in Pennsylvania, and 19 in\r\nNew York, who were for other candidates than Grant.  If their\r\nvotes had been counted for him it would have given Grant on\r\nthe first ballot 367 votes, 13 less than the number necessary\r\nfor a choice.  As his votes went up on one of the ballots\r\nto 313, it is pretty certain that counting these 63 votes\r\nfor Grant would have insured his nomination.  But there were\r\nseveral contests involving the title of their seats of 16\r\ndelegates from the State of Louisiana, 18 from Illinois, and\r\nthree others.  In regard to these cases the delegates voted\r\nin accordance with their preference for candidates.  This\r\nwas beside several other contests where the vote was not determined\r\nby that consideration.  Now if the vote of Illinois, Pennsylvania\r\nand New York had each been cast as a unit, in accordance\r\nwith the preference of the majority of the delegation in\r\neach case, these 37 votes would have been added to Grant's\r\ncolumn and subtracted from the forces of his various antagonists;\r\nand the 63 votes of the minority of the delegations in these\r\nthree States would also have been added to the Grant column,\r\nwhich would have given him a total vote of more than 400,\r\nenough to secure his nomination.  So the result of the convention\r\nwas to be determined by the adaption or rejection of what\r\nwas called the unit rule.\r\n\r\nDon Cameron, the Chairman of the National Committee, left\r\nthe Senate for Chicago about ten days, I think, before the\r\nday fixed for the meeting of the convention.  It was whispered\r\nabout before his departure that a scheme had been resolved\r\nupon by him and the other Grant leaders, which would compel\r\nthe adoption of the unit rule, whatever might be the desire\r\nof the convention itself.  It was his duty, according to established\r\ncustom, to call the convention to order and to receive nominations\r\nfor temporary presiding officer.  He was pledged, upon those\r\nnominations, as it was understood, to hold that the unit rule\r\nmust be applied.  In that way the sitting members from the\r\ndisputed States and districts would be permitted to vote, and\r\nthe votes of the three States would be cast without dissent\r\nfor the Grant candidate.  When the temporary President took\r\nhis place he would rule in the same way on the question of\r\nthe choice of a permanent President, and the permanent President\r\nwould rule in the same way on the conflicting votes, for the\r\nappointment of committees, for determining the seats of delegates,\r\nand finally the nomination of the candidates for President\r\nand Vice-President.  If the minority claimed the right to\r\nvote and took an appeal from his decision, he was to hold\r\nthat on the vote on that appeal the same unit rule was to\r\napply.  If a second point of order were raised, he would hold,\r\nof course, that a second point of order could not be raised\r\nwhile the first was pending.  So the way seemed clear to exclude\r\nthe contesting delegates, to cast the votes of the three great\r\nStates solid for Grant, and compel his nomination.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of the National Committee, of which Cameron\r\nwas Chairman, was opposed to Grant.  They met, I think, the\r\nday before the meeting of the convention to make the preliminary\r\narrangements.  Mr. Cameron, the Chairman, was asked whether\r\nit was his purpose to carry out the scheme I have indicated.\r\nHe refused to answer.  A motion was then made that the Chairman,\r\nafter calling the convention to order, be instructed to receive\r\nthe vote of the individual delegates without regard to the\r\ninstruction of the majority of their delegation.  Cameron\r\nrefused to receive motions on that question, saying that it\r\nwas a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the committee.  A\r\nlarge part of the entire day was spent in various attempts\r\nto induce Cameron either to give a pledge or permit a resolution\r\nto be entertained by the committee, instructing him as to\r\nhis action.  He was supported by Mr. Gorham, of California,\r\nwho I believe was not a member of the committee, but was\r\npresent either as Secretary or as _Amicus Curiae_.  He was\r\nan experienced parliamentarian, and for a long time had been\r\nSecretary of the Senate of the United States.  The discussion\r\nfor the majority was conducted largely by Mr. Chandler, of\r\nNew Hampshire, afterward Secretary of the Navy, and later\r\nSenator.  After spending a large part of the day in that discussion,\r\nsome time in the afternoon an intimation was made, informally,\r\nand in a rather veiled fashion, that, unless they had more\r\nsatisfactory pledges from Mr. Cameron, he would be removed\r\nfrom the office of Chairman, and a person who would carry\r\nout the wishes of the committee be substituted.  The committee\r\nthen adjourned until the next morning.  Meantime the Grant\r\nmanagers applied to Colonel Strong, of Illinois, who had been\r\nalready appointed Sergeant-at-Arms by the committee, and\r\nwho was a supporter of Grant, to ascertain whether, if the\r\ncommittee were to remove Cameron and appoint another chairman,\r\nhe would recognize him as a person entitled to call the convention\r\nto order and preside until a temporary Chairman was chosen,\r\nand would execute his lawful orders, or whether he would treat\r\nthem as without effect and would execute the orders of Cameron.\r\nHe desired time of consideration, which was conceded.  He\r\nconsulted Senator Philetus Sawyer of Wisconsin, who was himself\r\nin favor of General Grant, but who desired above all things\r\nthe success of the Republican Party, and was not ready for\r\nany unlawful or revolutionary action.  Mr. Sawyer was a business\r\nman of plain manners, and though of large experience in public\r\nlife, was not much versed in parliamentary law.  He called\r\ninto consultation ex-Senator Timothy O. Howe, of Wisconsin,\r\nformerly Senator from that State, and afterward Postmaster-\r\nGeneral under Arthur.  He was a very able and clear-headed\r\nlawyer, and had a high reputation for integrity.  He advised\r\nMr. Strong that the committee might lawfully depose their\r\nChairman and appoint another, and that it would be his duty,\r\nas Sergeant-at-Arms, to recognize the new Chairman and obey\r\nhis lawful orders.  Strong was under great obligations to\r\nSawyer, who had aided him very largely in business matters,\r\nand had a high respect for his judgment.  He gave his response\r\nto the Grant leaders in accordance with the advice of Mr.\r\nHowe, in which Senator Sawyer concurred.  They had intended\r\nto make General Creswell the President of the convention.\r\nBut finding it impossible to carry their plans into effect,\r\nin order to prevent the severe measure of deposing the Chairman\r\nof the committee, they consented that the assurances demanded\r\nshould be given.  There was then a negotiation between the\r\nleaders on the side of Grant and of Blaine for an agreement\r\nupon a presiding officer.  It was well known that I was not\r\nin favor of the nomination of either.  Senator Hamlin, formerly\r\nVice-President and then a Senator, proposed my name to Mr.\r\nConkling as a person likely to be impartial between the two\r\nprincipal candidates.  Mr. Conkling replied that such a suggestion\r\nwas an insult.  Hamlin said: \"I guess I can stand the insult.\"\r\nBut on consultation of the Grant men and the Blaine men it\r\nwas agreed that I should be selected, which was done accordingly.\r\nI was nominated orally from the floor when Mr. Cameron called\r\nthe convention to order, and chosen temporary President by\r\nacclamation and unanimously.  As proceedings went on it was\r\nthought best not to have any division or question as to a\r\npermanent Chairman and it was at the proper time ordered,\r\nalso without objection, that I should act as permanent President.\r\n\r\nBut the Grant leaders were still confident.  They felt sure\r\nthat none of their original votes, numbering three hundred\r\nand more, would desert them, and that it would be impossible\r\nfor the rest of the convention, divided among so many candidates,\r\nto agree, and that they would in the end get a majority.\r\n\r\nI was myself exceedingly anxious on this subject.  I also\r\nfelt that if the followers of Grant could get any pretext for\r\ngetting an advantage by any claim, however doubtful, that\r\nthey would avail themselves of it, even at the risk of breaking\r\nup the convention in disorder, rather than be baffled in\r\ntheir object.  So the time to me was one of great and distressing\r\nresponsibility.  The forces of Grant were led on the floor\r\nof the convention by Roscoe Conkling, who nominated him in\r\na speech of great power and eloquence.  The forces of Blaine\r\nwere led, as they had been in 1876, very skilfuly by Senators\r\nHale and Frye.  Garfield was the leader of the supporters\r\nof Mr. Sherman.  One of the greatest oratoric triumphs I ever\r\nwitnessed was obtained by Garfield.  There had been a storm\r\nof applause, lasting, I think, twenty-five minutes, at the\r\nclose of Conkling's nominating speech.  It was said there\r\nwere fifteen thousand persons in the galleries, which came\r\ndown very near the level of the floor.  The scene was of indescribable\r\nsublimity.  The fate of the country, certainly the fate of\r\na great political party, was at stake, and, more than that,\r\nthe selection of the ruler of a nation of fifty millions of\r\npeople--a question which in other countries could not have\r\nbeen determined, under like circumstances, without bloodshed\r\nor civil war.  I do not think I shall be charged with exaggeration\r\nwhen I speak of it in this way.  I can only compare it in\r\nits grandeur and impressiveness to the mighty torrent of Niagara.\r\nPerhaps I cannot give a satisfactory reason for so distinguishing\r\nit from other like assemblies that have gathered in this country.\r\nBut I have since seen a great number of persons from all parts\r\nof the country who were present as members or spectators,\r\nand they all speak of it in the same way.  A vast portion\r\nof the persons present in the hall sympathized deeply with\r\nthe supporters of Grant.  Conkling's speech, as he stood\r\nalmost in the centre of that great assembly on a platform\r\njust above the heads of the convention, was a masterpiece\r\nof splendid oratory.  He began:\r\n\r\n  And when asked what State he hails from,\r\n  Our sole reply shall be,\r\n  He comes from Appomattox,\r\n  And its famous apple-tree.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty difficult for Garfield to follow this speech\r\nin the tempest of applause which came after it.  There was\r\nnothing stimulant or romantic in the plain wisdom of John\r\nSherman.  It was like reading a passage from \"Poor Richard's\r\nAlmanac\" after one of the lofty chapters of the Psalms of\r\nDavid.  Garfield began, quietly:\r\n\r\n\"I have witnessed the extraordinary scene of this convention\r\nwith deep solicitude.  Nothing touches my heart more quickly\r\nthan a tribute of honor to a great and noble character.  But\r\nas I sat in my seat and witnessed this demonstration, this\r\nassemblage seemed to me a human ocean in a tempest.  I have\r\nseen the sea lashed into fury and tossed into spray, and its\r\ngrandeur moves the soul of the dullest man; but I remember\r\nthat it is not the billows, but the calm level of the sea\r\nfrom which all heights and depths are measured.  When the\r\nstorm has passed and the hour of calm settles on the ocean,\r\nwhen the sunlight bathes its peaceful surface, then the astronomer\r\nand surveyor take the level from which they measure all terrestrial\r\nheights and depths.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Convention, your present temper may not\r\nmark the healthful pulse of our people.  When your enthusiasm\r\nhas passed, when the emotions of the hour have subsided, we\r\nshall find below this storm and passion that calm level of\r\npublic opinion from which the thoughts of a mighty people\r\nare to be measured, and by which their final action will be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\"Not here, in this brilliant circle where fifteen thousand\r\nmen and women are gathered, is the destiny of the Republic\r\nto be decreed for the next four years--not here, where I see\r\nthe enthusiastic faces of seven hundred and fifty-six delegates,\r\nwaiting to cast their lot into the urn and determine the choice\r\nof the Republic; but by four millions of Republican firesides,\r\nwhere the thoughtful voters, with wives and children about\r\nthem, with the calm thoughts inspired by love of home and\r\ncountry, with the history of the past, the hopes of the future,\r\nand reverence for the great men who have adorned and blessed\r\nour nation in days gone by, burning in their hearts--_there_\r\nGod prepares the verdict which will determine the wisdom of\r\nour work to-night.  Not in Chicago, in the heat of June, but\r\nat the ballot-boxes of the Republic, in the quiet of November,\r\nafter the silence of deliberate judgment, will this question\r\nbe settled.\"\r\n\r\nConkling, while exciting the admiration of all men for his\r\ndexterity and ability, lost ground at every step.  He made\r\na foolish attempt to compel the passage of a resolution depriving\r\nof their rights to vote delegates who refused to pledge themselves\r\nto support the choice of the convention whoever it might be.\r\nHis speech nominating Grant contained a sneer at Blaine.  So,\r\nwhile he held his forces together to the last, he made it\r\nalmost impossible for any man who differed from him in the\r\nbeginning to come to him at the end.  On the contrary everything\r\nthat Garfield said was marked by good nature and good sense.\r\nI said on the first day of the convention that in my opinion\r\nif the delegates could be shut up by themselves and not permitted\r\nto leave the room until they agreed, the man on whom they\r\nwould agree would be General Garfield.  This desire became\r\nmore and more apparent as the convention went on.  At last,\r\non the thirty-sixth ballot, and the sixth day of the convention,\r\nthe delegates who had previously voted for other candidates\r\nthan Grant, began to wheel into line for Garfield.  Garfield\r\nhad one vote from the State of Pennsylvania in previous ballots.\r\nBut on the thirty-fourth ballot Wisconsin, the last State\r\nto vote in alphabetical order, had given him her sixteen votes,\r\nand on the thirty-sixth ballot she was joined by the delegates\r\nwho had voted for other candidates than Grant.  Grant held\r\ntogether his forces till the last, receiving three hundred\r\nand thirteen votes on the thirty-fifth ballot, and three hundred\r\nand six on the thirty-sixth.  It was a sublime moment, which\r\nit was hoped would determine the destiny of the Republic for\r\nmany years, a hope which was cruelly disappointed by Garfield's\r\nuntimely death.  It was, as might be well believed, a moment\r\nof sublime satisfaction to me.  Garfield had been my friend\r\nfor many years.  I had sat close to him in the House of Representatives\r\nfor three terms of Congressional service.  He had been my\r\nguest at my house in Worcester; and I had been his colleague\r\non the Electoral Commission in 1876.  He had been educated\r\nat a Massachusetts college.  He was of old Middlesex County\r\nstock.  We were in thorough accord in our love for New England,\r\nour firm faith in her hereditary principles, and our pride\r\nin her noble history.\r\n\r\nGarfield has been charged, in accepting the nomination for\r\nthe Presidency, with having been untrue to the interests\r\nof John Sherman, who was the candidate of Ohio, and whom Garfield\r\nhad supported faithfully through every ballot.  The charge\r\nis absolutely unjust.  Mr. Sherman's nomination was seen by\r\neverybody to have been absolutely impossible long before the\r\nfinal result.  I was in constant consultation with leaders\r\nof the different delegations who were trying to unite their\r\nforces.  There never was any considerable number of those\r\npersons who thought the nomination of Mr. Sherman practicable,\r\nnotwithstanding the high personal respect in which they held\r\nhim.  At the close of the thirty-fourth ballot, when Garfield\r\nreceived seventeen votes, he rose, and the following incident\r\ntook place:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Garfield, of Ohio:  \"Mr. President, ----\"\r\n  The President:  \"For what purpose does the gentleman rise?\"\r\n  Mr. Garfield:  \"I rise to a question of order.\"\r\n  The President:  \"The gentleman from Ohio rises to a question\r\n  of order.\"\r\n  Mr. Garfield:  \"I challenge the correctness of the\r\n  announcement.  The announcement contains votes for me.\r\n  No man has a right, without the consent of the person voted\r\n  for, to announce that person's name, and vote for him, in\r\n  this convention.  Such consent I have not given.\"\r\n  The President:  \"The gentleman from Ohio is not stating\r\n  a question of order.  He will resume his seat.  No\r\n  person having received a majority of the votes cast, another\r\n  ballot will be taken.  The Clerk will call the roll.\"\r\n\r\nThis verbatim report is absolutely correct, except that where\r\nthere is a period at the end of Mr. Garfield's last sentence\r\nthere should be a dash, indicating that the sentence was not\r\nfinished.  I recollect the incident perfectly.  I interrupted\r\nhim in the middle of his sentence.  I was terribly afraid that\r\nhe would say something that would make his nomination impossible,\r\nor his acceptance impossible, if it were made.  I do not believe\r\nit ever happened before that anybody who attempted to decline\r\nthe Presidency of the United States was to be prevented by\r\na point of order, or that such a thing will ever happen again.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirtieth ballot a vote was cast by a delegate\r\nfrom the Territory of Wyoming for General Philip H. Sheridan.\r\nGeneral Sheridan, who was upon the platform as a spectator,\r\ncame forward instantly, and said:  \"I am very much obliged\r\nto the delegate from Wyoming for mentioning my name in this\r\nconvention, but there is no way in which I could accept a\r\nnomination from this convention, if it were possible, unless\r\nI should be permitted to turn it over to my best friend.\"\r\nThe President said:  \"The Chair presumed the unanimous consent\r\nof the convention to permit the illustrious soldier who has\r\nspoken to interrupt its order for its purpose.  But it will\r\nbe a privilege accorded to no other person whatever.\" The\r\nGeneral's prompt suppression of this attempt to make him a\r\ncandidate was done in a direct and blunt soldierly fashion.\r\nI did not think it best to apply to him the strictness of\r\nparliamentary law; and in that I was sure of the approval\r\nof the convention.  But the precedent of permitting such a\r\nbody to be addressed under any circumstances by a person not\r\na member would be a dangerous one, if repeated.  Perhaps I\r\nmay with propriety add one thing of a personal nature.  It\r\nhas been sometimes charged that the delegates from Massachusetts\r\nwere without great influence in shaping the result of this\r\nconvention.  They moved, and carried, against a formidable\r\nopposition, the civil service plank, which embodied the doctrine\r\nof civil service reform as among the doctrines of the Republican\r\nParty.  Of whatever value may be attributed to the humble\r\nservices of the President of the Convention, they are entitled\r\nto the credit.  They had, I think, more to do than any other\r\ndelegation with effecting the union upon Garfield.  Of course\r\nthe wishes of Mr. Blaine had very great influence indeed.\r\nI think he preferred Garfield to any other person except Robert\r\nLincoln, of Illinois, of whom he spoke to me as a person from\r\nwhom it would be impossible to keep the votes of the colored\r\ndelegates from the South, and who would be, by reason of the\r\nrespect felt for his father's memory, highly acceptable through\r\nthe country.  But Mr. Lincoln, under the circumstances, could\r\nnot have got the support of his own State, and without it\r\nit seemed unwise to attempt a union upon him.\r\n\r\nBut to continue with what is personal to myself and the delegation\r\nfrom Massachusetts.  When I got back to the Capitol, as I\r\nwent into the cloak-room of the Senate to leave my hat, Don\r\nCameron sat there surrounded by a group of interested listeners.\r\nHe was relating to them the story of the great contest.  As\r\nI approached the group he looked up and said:\r\n\r\n\"There comes Massachusetts.  There were twenty-three men from\r\nMassachusetts who went there to keep six hundred men from\r\ndoing what they wanted to.  And, by God, they did it.\"\r\n\r\nA few Sundays after his inauguration, during the spring session\r\nof the Senate, President Garfield invited Mrs. Hoar and myself\r\nto dinner at the White House.  President Hopkins, his old\r\nfriend and teacher, and Mrs. Hopkins were there.  There were\r\nno other guests, except Judge Nott and his wife, President\r\nHopkins's daughter, President Garfield's mother, and, I think,\r\nMr. Archibald Hopkins, President Hopkins's son.  President\r\nGarfield asked me to remain after President Hopkins had taken\r\nhis leave.  I had a long and interesting conversation with\r\nhim about his plans and purposes, and especially the difficulties\r\nwhich were then showing themselves in regard to the great\r\nNew York appointments.  Before I went upstairs, he gave his\r\narm to my wife and walked with her about the East room.  He\r\nsaid to her:  \"I hope I may live to repay your husband for\r\nall he has done for me.\"  Perhaps I am indulging in an unpardonable\r\nvanity in relating this testimony of two of the most interested\r\nparties and most competent observers as to the value of the\r\nwork of the Massachusetts delegation in that convention.\r\n\r\nI hope that somewhere before I die I may put on record my\r\nestimate of James A. Garfield, when I can say some things\r\nwhich ought to be said, and for which there is not room in\r\nthis book and was not room in the eulogy delivered just after\r\nhis death.  It is the fashion, even among his friends, to\r\nspeak of him as a person timid if not time-serving, and as\r\neasily swayed and moulded by a strong will.  I have heard\r\nmen who knew him very well say that when he led the House\r\non the Republican side, and had led his party into a position\r\nwhich excited sharp conflict, they never could be sure that\r\nhe would not get wrong at the last moment, or have some private\r\nunderstanding with the Democrats and leave his own side in\r\nthe lurch.  This was attributed to moral timidity.  I feel\r\nvery sure that this is a great mistake.  Garfield's hesitation,\r\nwant of certainty in his convictions, liability to change\r\nhis position suddenly, were in my opinion the result of intellectual\r\nhesitation and of a habit of going down to the roots of his\r\nsubject before he made up his mind.  He had a great deference\r\nfor other men's opinions.  When, after he had expressed his\r\nopinion, some strong and positive man came to him with a confident\r\nutterance of a different opinion, unless Garfield had gone\r\nto the bottom of the subject himself, he was very likely to\r\ndefer, to hesitate, to think himself mistaken.  But when he\r\nhad had time and had thought the thing out and made up his\r\nmind, nobody and no consideration of personal interest or\r\nadvantage would stir him an inch.  I suppose his courage and\r\ngenius as a soldier have never been questioned.  He performed\r\nsome very important military exploits.  He gave a thorough\r\ninvestigation into the military conditions of Tennessee and\r\nKentucky, and his letter to the Department of War accomplished\r\na great deal toward putting things in a better way.  He was\r\na thorough lover of his country.  He hesitated long as to\r\nthe doctrine of protection, and undoubtedly made some inconsistent\r\nutterances before he took the ground which he held at last.  But\r\nhe studied the financial question, especially the great subjects\r\nof currency and the standard of value, to the very bottom.\r\nHe stood like a rock when Ohio and the whole West seemed to\r\nbe going against him, and when the statesmanship even of John\r\nSherman was of the willow and not of the oak.  When his District\r\nConvention met and passed resolutions in favor of paying interest\r\non the Government bonds with paper, Garfield declared that\r\nhe would not take the nomination on such a platform.  The\r\ngood fight he made in Ohio turned the scale in that great\r\nstruggle.  I do not believe he wold have been a tool or servant\r\nin the Presidency.  He would have mastered for himself the\r\ngreat subjects to be dealt with in our foreign policy, as\r\nwell as in domestic administration and legislation.  His will\r\nwould, in my opinion, if he had been spared to us, have been\r\nthe dominant will in our Government for eight fortunate and\r\nhappy years.  Next to the assassination of Lincoln, his death\r\nwas the greatest national misfortune ever caused to this country\r\nby the loss of a single life.\r\n\r\nI have not the slightest respect for the suggestion that\r\nGeneral Garfield in the least violated his honor or good\r\nfaith in consenting to accept the nomination after he had\r\nbeen elected as a delegate in the interest of Mr. Sherman.\r\nThe office of the President is not personal.  There can be\r\nno such thing as a personal claim upon it, or a personal\r\nobligation in regard to it.  President Garfield got no advantage\r\nwhatever from the fact that he had favored Mr. Sherman.  Mr.\r\nSherman's nomination was an impossibility from the beginning.\r\nThat the majority of the convention united upon Garfield was\r\ndue to the fact that he had no enemies or antagonists in the\r\nconvention or among the people and, to some degree undoubtedly,\r\nalso to the admiration felt by his fellow-delegates for the\r\ntact, sense and good nature which he showed in its discussions--\r\nqualities which were in marked contrast with those of his\r\nvery able and powerful antagonist, Mr. Conkling.\r\n\r\nBeside, when the voting for Garfield in the Convention began,\r\na dispatch was received from Mr. Sherman urging his friends\r\nto unite in Garfield's support.  That was before Garfield\r\nhad taken any action, except an earnest attempt to decline\r\nthe nomination which, as I have already stated, was suppressed\r\nby a peremptory exercise of the authority of the chair.\r\n\r\nI have given more than once my estimate of James A.  Garfield,\r\nalthough not as fully as I should like.  Shortly after his\r\ndeath I delivered a eulogy before the people of Worcester\r\nat the request of the City Government.  I was asked by John\r\nSherman, who more than anybody else had the matter in charge,\r\nto deliver the eulogy before the two Houses of Congress.  But\r\nMr. Sherman had spoken without due authority.  The Committee\r\nof the two Houses determined to invite Mr. Blaine, then Secretary\r\nof State.  That arrangement was required by every consideration\r\nof propriety, and was in all respects the best possible.  Mr.\r\nBlaine's address on Garfield is one of the treasures of our\r\nliterature.  It would have been a great public misfortune\r\nif that noble oration had been lost to the world.\r\n\r\nI knew Garfield very intimately.  For six of the eight years\r\nI served in the House with him my seat was so near his that\r\nwe could converse with each other in whispers.  By a singular\r\nchapter of accidents our families had been closely associated\r\nin several generations, although neither of us knew it until\r\nlong after our friendship began.\r\n\r\nThe land of Captain John Sherman and the land of Captain John\r\nPrescott, both my ancestors on the mother's side, adjoined\r\nthe land of Edward Garfield, the ancestor of the President,\r\nin Watertown.  His land lay on both sides of what is now the\r\nline between Waltham and Watertown.  Captain Benjamin Garfield,\r\nwho may be properly called the founder of Waltham, was the\r\nleader of an earnest and protracted controversy in Watertown\r\nin which my great-great-grandfather, Joseph Sherman, was leader\r\non the other side.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Thomas Garfield, another of the President's ancestors\r\nin the direct line, built a house in that part of Watertown,\r\nafterward Weston, which later still was incorporated with\r\nparts of Concord and Lexington as the town of Lincoln.  He\r\nand his son Thomas were among the first incorporators, of\r\nwhom my great-grandfather, John Hoar, was also one.  Thomas\r\nGarfield built a house now standing at the end of a grass-\r\ngrown lane about forty rods from the high road leading from\r\nLincoln to Waltham and about two miles south from the centre\r\nof Lincoln.  It is a secluded spot of great beauty.  The house,\r\na square, unpainted, two-story house with a great chimney\r\nin the middle, stands surrounded by old elms and apple trees,\r\nin a tract of fertile meadow, with the Lincoln hill in the\r\ndistance.  This estate passed from Lieutenant Thomas Garfield\r\nto his son Thomas, Jr., from him to his daughter Rebecca,\r\nwife of David Fiske, from her to her son Elijah Fiske, and\r\nfrom him to his children.  One of these children married my\r\ncousin.  I attended the wedding in my boyhood in the old Garfield\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAbram Garfield, son of the second Thomas, the President's\r\ngreat-uncle, from whom his middle name came to him, was a\r\nsoldier at Concord Bridge on the 19th of April, 1775, in the\r\nLincoln Company of which my grandfather, Samuel Hoar, was\r\nLieutenant and my two great-grandfathers served as privates.\r\nThe depositions of Abram Garfield and John Hoar as to the\r\nfacts of the Concord fight were taken with others by the patriots\r\nand sent to England for their vindication.  This Abram Garfield\r\ndied in the summer of 1775, a few months after the battle\r\nat Concord.  His grave, with that of his father and grandfather,\r\nthe President's direct ancestors, is close to the graves of\r\nmy own ancestors in the Lincoln burial-ground.\r\n\r\nThe President's great-grandfather settled in Westminster.\r\nHis land was close by the land of my wife's great-grandfather,\r\nand not far from the spot where her father was born.  His\r\nhouse is still standing in Westminster.  My grandfather's\r\nuncle, Daniel Hoar, was one of the founders of that town and\r\nowned land not far off.\r\n\r\nSo our friendship came by lawful inheritance.  I discovered\r\nmyself many of these facts relating to his ancestry which\r\nhad been previously unknown to him.  I have from him a letter\r\nwritten the day before he was assassinated in which he promises\r\nafter visiting Williams College and the White Mountains to\r\nmeet me at Concord and to spend the night with my brother\r\nthere and visit the dwelling and burial places of his ancestors\r\nin Lincoln and then to come to Worcester as my guest.\r\n\r\nJames A. Garfield was a man of indefatigable industry and\r\nvast information.  He seemed constantly possessed by an intelligent\r\ncuriosity in regard to all subjects.  He had a tenacious memory.\r\nIts stores were always ready at hand for his use on all occasions.\r\nThere has been no man in public life in my time, except Charles\r\nSumner, who was always so glad to render any service in his\r\npower to literature and science.  He was a great friend of\r\nthe Congressional Library, and helped largely to increase\r\nits appropriations.  I got his powerful aid in procuring the\r\npurchase of the Margry papers, at the instance of Parkman,\r\nthe historian.\r\n\r\nDuring Garfield's service in the House he was the leader\r\nof its best thought.  Everything he did and said manifested\r\nthe serious, reverent love of excellence.  He was ever grave,\r\nearnest, addressing himself only to the reason and conscience\r\nof his auditors.  You will search his speeches in vain for\r\nan appeal to a base motive or an evil passion.  He was remarkably\r\nindependent in forming his judgments and inflexible in adhering\r\nto them on all grand and essential questions.  His friend\r\nand Commander, General Thomas, whose stubborn courage saved\r\nthe day in the battle for the possession of Tennessee, was\r\nwell called The Rock of Chickamauga.  In the greater battle\r\nin 1876 for the Nation's honor Garfield well deserves to be\r\ncalled The Rock of Ohio.  There has been hardly any single\r\nservice to this country in recent times greater than that\r\nrendered by him when he stood against the fiat money movement\r\nin Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\nFOUR NATIONAL CONVENTIONS\r\n1884\r\n\r\nIt happened to me again to be put at the head of the Massachusetts\r\ndelegation in the convention of 1884.  The leading candidates\r\nwere Mr. Blaine and President Arthur.  Mr. Arthur had, in\r\nmany respects, made a very satisfactory President.  He was\r\na man of pleasant manners and skilled in the subtle ways of\r\nNew York politicians.  He had been one of the chief representatives\r\nof a faction in the Republican Party, and he never seemed\r\nable to shake off the influences which had surrounded him\r\nbefore his election.  At a dinner shortly after he was chosen\r\nVice-President, he made an apparently approving allusion to\r\nwhat he called the use of soap, which was understood to mean\r\nthe use of money for corrupt purposes.  He made a fatal mistake,\r\nas it always seemed to me, in permitting the resignation of\r\nPresident Garfield's Cabinet and filling their places with\r\nmen who, like himself, belonged to the Grant faction.  If\r\nhe had said that he would not allow the act of an assassin\r\nto make a change in the forces that were to control the Administration\r\nso far as could be helped and that he would carry into effect\r\nthe purposes of his predecessor, wherever he could in conscience\r\ndo so, he would have maintained himself in the public esteem.\r\nBut that was not his only mistake.  Inconsiderately he lent\r\nhimself to the popular prejudice against the policy of river\r\nand harbor improvements, and, in vetoing a bill passed by\r\nlarge majorities in both Houses of Congress, he sent in a\r\nmessage in which he said in substance that the more corrupt\r\nthe measure the more votes it was likely to get in Congress.\r\nWhen in the next winter he was asked to specify the objectionable\r\nitems in the bill he had vetoed, which appropriated about\r\n$18,000,000, he was able to point out less than five per cent.\r\nof all the appropriations which he could say he thought were\r\nfor purposes not required by the interests of international\r\nor interstate commerce.  And his claim was thoroughly refuted\r\neven in regard to the items which he specified.  He also\r\nmade some very bad appointments, which deeply offended the\r\nbest Republican sentiment in many of the States.  It is a\r\nlittle singular that the appointment of the Collector of\r\nthe Port of Boston should have cost two Presidents of the\r\nUnited States a renomination.  Yet so it is.  The old feeling\r\nin Massachusetts that it was not, on the whole, desirable\r\nto nominate Mr. Blaine existed in great strength.  The business\r\nmen liked Arthur.  They thought their interests were safe\r\nwith him.  But the honest Republican sentiment of Massachusetts\r\nwas deeply outraged by the appointment to the office of Collector\r\nof Boston, of Mr. Roland Worthington, against the protest\r\nof her Senators and Representatives in Congress.  He had been\r\nknown only as an unscrupulous supporter of General Butler,\r\nand as the editor of a scurrilous newspaper which bitterly\r\nattacked the opponents of that person even where they were\r\nhonest and trusted Republicans.  To give this place to Mr.\r\nWorthington the President refused to reappoint Mr. Beard,\r\nwho had made an admirable Collector, and who was supported\r\nby a large majority of the best men of Boston.  It was believed\r\nthat this appointment had been made in exchange for assurances\r\nof General Butler's support in the approaching election.\r\nWorthington made a poor Collector, and, at the State election\r\nafter his appointment, voted for Butler against the candidate\r\nof the Republican Party.  But for the indignation caused by\r\nthis appointment, I think the delegation from Massachusetts,\r\nwith three exceptions, would have supported Mr. Arthur for\r\nreelection.  There would have been no movement for Mr. Edmunds,\r\nand but for that movement Mr. Arthur would have received\r\nthe Republican nomination.  Upon the final ballot the vote\r\nof Massachusetts was seven for Arthur, three for Blaine and\r\neighteen for Edmunds.\r\n\r\nA somewhat interesting incident occurred which shows the depth\r\nof a feeling, which I think was largely a prejudice, which\r\nis still manifesting itself as a disturbing element in American\r\npolitics.  There was a great desire on the part of those who\r\nwere opposed to both Arthur and Blaine, to find a candidate\r\nupon whom they could unite, of such popularity and national\r\ndistinction as to make it impossible for the managers for\r\nthese candidates to hold their forces together.  We thought\r\nthat General Sherman was the person that we wanted.  It was\r\nknown that he had written a letter to Mr. Blaine declining\r\nto have his name used, and that a telegram had been received\r\nfrom him by a delegate during the session of the convention\r\nto the same effect.  But it was thought that if he were once\r\nnominated he would find it impossible to decline, and that\r\nhis previous refusal would be an element of strength and not\r\nof weakness in the country.  After the adjournment, which\r\nwas at 11:45 A. M., on Friday, June 6, the day before the\r\nballoting, I made an arrangement to meet Mr. George William\r\nCurtis, the Chairman of the New York delegation, and one or\r\ntwo other gentlemen of the same way of thinking, from one\r\nor two other States, and we agreed that when the convention\r\ncame in again we would cast the votes of our delegates who\r\nagreed with us for General Sherman.  I had been authorized\r\nby a large majority of the Massachusetts delegation to have\r\nthis interview, and I knew that I represented their opinions,\r\nalthough they had not, all of them, spoken to me about General\r\nSherman.  When I got back to the next meeting of the convention,\r\nI made known to them what I had done.  I was told by several\r\nof them that they would stand by me, but that it would cause\r\ngreat dissatisfaction when they got home.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" I said.  \"Our people do not want a Father\r\nConfessor in the White House,\" was the answer.  Although General\r\nSherman was a Protestant, it is well known that his wife was\r\na Catholic.  Soon after, Mr. Curtis came over to my seat and\r\nsaid:  \"Mr. Hoar, I cannot carry out our agreement.\" \"What\r\nis the matter?\" said I.  \"There is an insurrection in the\r\nNew York delegation,\" was his reply.  \"They do not want a\r\nFather Confessor in the White House.\" So we agreed we should\r\nhave to give it up.  When I came back to Washington, I called\r\nat John Sherman's house and talked over the convention with\r\nhim.  I told him the story I have just related.  He said he\r\nwas not surprised, and that he believed the unwillingness\r\nto have the religious faith of his wife made matter of public\r\ndiscussion had a good deal to do with his brother's refusal to\r\npermit himself to be a candidate.\r\n\r\nWhile the convention of 1884 did not nominate the candidate\r\nfavored by the Republicans of Massachusetts, the action of\r\nthe State, in my opinion, was decisive in defeating the nomination\r\nof President Arthur.  But for that there would have been no\r\nmovement for Edmunds, and his support would have gone to the\r\nPresident.  Mr. Blaine, who was nominated, was defeated at\r\nthe election.  The event proved him a much stronger candidate\r\nthan I had supposed, and his subsequent career in the Department\r\nof State, I believe, satisfied a majority of his countrymen\r\nthat he would have made an able and discreet President.  I\r\nsuppose it would hardly be denied now by persons acquainted\r\nwith the details of the management of the Democratic campaign,\r\nat any rate I have heard the fact admitted by several very\r\ndistinguished Democrats, members of the Senate of the United\r\nStates, that the plurality of the vote of New York was really\r\ncast for Mr. Blaine, and that he was unjustly deprived of\r\nelection by the fraud at Long Island City by which votes cast\r\nfor the Butler Electoral Ticket were counted for Cleveland.\r\nI suppose also that but for the utterances of a foolish clergyman\r\nnamed Burchard, Mr. Blaine's majority in that State would\r\nhave been so large that these frauds would have been ineffectual.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\nFOUR NATIONAL CONVENTIONS\r\n1888\r\n\r\nIn 1888 there was a very strong, almost irresistible feeling\r\namong Republicans in the country that Blaine should be put\r\nin nomination again, although he had peremptorily and publicly\r\nrefused to be a candidate.  He was travelling abroad during\r\nthat year.  His mental vigor was unabated, as was shown by\r\nhis answer to Cleveland's free trade message, which was cabled\r\nacross the ocean and reached the people almost as soon as\r\nthe message.  But the disease of which he afterward died was\r\nthen upon him, as was known to some few of his intimate friends.\r\nBesides that, he had had an attack at Milan, which deprived\r\nhim for a good while of the use of his limbs on one side.\r\nIn 1892 I was in the care, at Milan, of a man who I suppose\r\nwas the most eminent physician in the north of Italy, Dr.\r\nFornoni, who gave me an account of Mr. Blaine's illness in\r\nthe very apartments where I was ill, and which Blaine had\r\noccupied before me.  But when the convention came together\r\nthey were so eager to nominate Blaine that he was obliged\r\nto send another cable, I think, from Paris, insisting that\r\nhis wishes should be respected.  There was a great diversity\r\nof opinion as to candidates, but little of the eager antagonism\r\nthat had characterized the preceding convention.  The Republican\r\nParty had been sobered a good deal by four years of adversity.\r\nThe delegates from Massachusetts where:\r\n\r\n_At Large._--George F. Hoar, Worcester; Henry S. Hyde, West\r\nSpringfield; Frederick L. Burden, North Attleboro; Alanson\r\nW. Beard, Boston.\r\n\r\n_District._--Frank S. Stevens, Swansea; Jonathan Bourne,\r\nNew Bedford; William H. Bent, Taunton; Eben L. Ripley, Hingham;\r\nArthur W. Tufts, Boston; Edward P. Wilbur, Boston; Jesse M.\r\nGove, Boston; Charles J. Noyes, Boston; Edward D. Hayden,\r\nWoburn; Elmer H. Capen, Somerville; William B. Littlefield,\r\nLynn; Samuel W. McCall, Winchester; William Cogswell, Salem;\r\nWilliam E. Blunt, Haverhill; Joseph L. Sargent, Dracut; George\r\nS. Merrill, Lawrence; J. Henry Gould, Medford; David Farquhar,\r\nNewton; William A. Gile, Worcester; George L. Gibbs, Northbridge;\r\nJohn W. Wheeler, Orange; John G. Mackintosh, Holyoke; Emerson\r\nGaylord, Chicopee; and William M. Prince, Pittsfield.\r\n\r\nI was very desirous that the vote of Massachusetts should\r\nbe given to John Sherman.  He was, except Mr. Blaine, unquestionably\r\nthe most distinguished living Republican statesman.  He had\r\nbeen an able champion of the opinions which the Republicans\r\nof Massachusetts held, and of the policies under which her\r\nspecial industries had been fostered.  To nominate him would\r\nbe to go back to the early habit of placing the greatest and\r\nwisest statesmen of the country in its highest offices.  But\r\nI could not get the majority of the Massachusetts delegation\r\nto come to my way of thinking.  General Coggswell, a very\r\nable and accomplished member of the House of Representatives,\r\nand Mr. Edward D. Hayden, also a member of the House--a\r\nservice which he left greatly to the regret of his own constituents\r\nand the people of the State--seemed to have very strong objections\r\nindeed to Mr. Sherman.  The delegation very kindly offered\r\nbefore the first ballot, and again just before the fourth\r\nor fifth ballot, to present my name as the candidate of Massachusetts.\r\nIt would have been a very great honor to have received such\r\na vote from Massachusetts.  I was told also by gentlemen from\r\nother States, who spoke to me about it, that I should have\r\nhad a considerable vote from other parts of the country.  I\r\nhad quite a number of very intimate friends in the convention\r\nfrom States outside of Massachusetts.  I thought then, and\r\nthink now, though that is a matter of conjecture, that I should\r\nhave got about seventy votes.  But I thought my nomination\r\nout of the question.  I thought also that it would be utterly\r\ninexpedient, if it could be accomplished.  And I thought also\r\nthat the office of a Senator from Massachusetts would be\r\nmore agreeable to me, and better adapted to my capacity than\r\nthat of the President of the United States.  Still the temptation\r\nto get the high compliment and honor of such a vote was very\r\nstrong indeed.  But there were thirteen of our delegation\r\nof twenty-eight, who were willing to vote with me for Mr.\r\nSherman.  If I had consented to the subtraction of their votes\r\nfrom his column on the first ballot, it would have made a\r\nserious diminution of his strength.\r\n\r\nIf I had consented to the same thing on a later ballot it\r\nwould have put him in the position of having his forces diminishing\r\nand falling away.  I thought I ought not, for a mere empty\r\nhonor to myself, to permit such an injury to be inflicted\r\nupon him, although I confess I did not then think his nomination\r\nlikely.  But while the Massachusetts delegation does not seem\r\nto me to have exerted a very decisive influence upon the result\r\nof that convention, it came very near it.  After several ineffectual\r\nballotings, in which the votes of the different States were\r\ndivided among several candidates, the convention took a recess\r\nat twelve o'clock to four o'clock of the same day.  Immediately\r\na meeting was called by a number of gentlemen representing\r\ndifferent delegations in a room in the building where the\r\nconvention was held, for consultation, and to see if they\r\ncould agree upon a candidate.  The Massachusetts delegation\r\nhad authorized me to cast their vote as a unit for any candidate\r\nwhom I should think best, whom sixteen of the delegates--\r\nbeing one more than a majority--approved.  I had ascertained\r\ntheir opinion.  While as I said there were but thirteen at\r\nmost who would support Sherman, considerably more than sixteen\r\nwere willing to support either Harrison or Allison, and perhaps\r\none or two others, who had been prominently mentioned, including,\r\nI think, Mr. Depew, although of that I am not certain.  We\r\nmet as I said.  The New York delegation had authorized its\r\nvote to be cast unanimously for any person on whom the four\r\ndelegates at large, Platt, Miller, Depew and Hiscock, representing\r\ndifferent shades of opinion in the Republican Party of that\r\nState, should agree.  Three of these gentlemen, Platt, Miller\r\nand Hiscock, were present at the meeting.  Mr. Quay, Chairman\r\nof the Pennsylvania delegation, was also authorized to cast\r\nthe vote of the entire delegation as he should think fit.\r\nMr. Spooner of Wisconsin, Chairman of the Wisconsin delegation,\r\nwas present with a like authority.  Mr. Farwell, Chairman\r\nof the Illinois delegation, was present with a like authority\r\nfrom his State.  Mr. Clarkson, Chairman of the Iowa delegation,\r\nwas present with authority to vote for Mr. Allison from the\r\nbeginning.  De Young, of California, thought he could speak\r\nfor his people, though I believe without claiming authority\r\nfrom them.  Filley, of Missouri, was also present.  There\r\nwere several other gentlemen of influence, though not all\r\nof them delegates, and not all of them entitled to speak for\r\ntheir States, but feeling able to assure the company that\r\ntheir States would accede to whatever agreement might be made\r\nthere.  The names of several candidates were discussed.  I\r\nmade a very earnest speech in favor of Mr. Allison, setting\r\nforth what I thought were the qualities that would make him\r\na popular candidate, and would make him an able and wise President.\r\n\r\nFinally, all agreed that their States should vote for Mr.\r\nAllison when the convention came in in the afternoon.  Depew,\r\nas I have said, was absent.  But his three colleagues said\r\nthere could be no doubt that he would agree to their action,\r\nand there would be no difficulty about New York.  We thought\r\nit best as a matter of precaution, to meet again a half-hour\r\nbefore the coming in of the convention, to make sure the thing\r\nwas to go through all right.  I suppose that everybody in\r\nthat room when he left it felt as certain as of any event\r\nin the future that Mr. Allison would be nominated in the convention.\r\n\r\nBut when we met at the time fixed, the three delegates at\r\nlarge from New York said they were sorry they could not carry\r\nout their engagement.  Mr. Depew, who had been supported as\r\na candidate by his State in the earlier ballots, had made\r\na speech withdrawing his name.  But when the action of the\r\nmeeting was reported to him, he said he had been compelled\r\nto withdraw by the opposition of the Agrarian element, which\r\nwas hostile to railroads.  He was then President of the New\r\nYork Central and Hudson River Railroad Company.  He said that\r\nhis opposition to him came largely from Iowa, and from the\r\nNorthwest, where was found the chief support of Allison; that\r\nwhile he had withdrawn his own name, he would not so far submit\r\nto such an unreasonable and socialistic sentiment as to give\r\nhis consent that it should dictate a candidate for the Republican\r\nParty.  The three other delegates at large were therefore\r\ncompelled to refuse their support to the arrangement which\r\nhad been conditionally agreed upon, and the thing fell through.\r\nIf it had gone on, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,\r\nMassachusetts, Iowa, California, and perhaps Missouri, would\r\nhave cast their votes unanimously for Allison, and his nomination\r\nwould have been sure.  I think no other person ever came so\r\nnear the Presidency of the United States, and missed it.\r\n\r\nThe result was the nomination of Mr. Harrison.  It was a nomination\r\nquite agreeable to me.  I had sat near him in the Senate for\r\nsix years, my seat only separated from his by that of John\r\nSherman, who, for a large part of the time, had been President\r\npro tempore.  So Sherman's seat was not then occupied and\r\nHarrison and I were next neighbors.  I had become very intimate\r\nwith him, and had learned to respect him highly as a very\r\nable, upright and wise man, although he developed, as President,\r\nan ability which I think his most intimate friends had not\r\nknown before.  Our relations then, and afterward, were exceedingly\r\ncordial.  He was a wise, pure, upright and able President,\r\nand an eloquent orator, capable of uttering great truths in\r\na great way, and able to bring them home to the understanding\r\nand conviction of his countrymen.  He lacked what gave Mr.\r\nBlaine so great a charm, the quality of an agreeable and gracious\r\nmanner.  He had little tact in dealing with individuals.  If\r\na man travelled three thousand miles across the continent\r\nto say something to President Harrison, he would find himself\r\nbroken in upon two minutes after the conversation began with\r\na lecture in which the views in opposition to his were vigorously,\r\nand, sometimes roughly, set forth.  He did this even when\r\nhe was of the same way of thinking and meant to grant the\r\ngentleman's request.  Blaine would refuse a request in a way\r\nthat would seem like doing a favor.  Harrison would grant\r\na request in a way which seemed as if he were denying it.\r\nAn eminent Western Senator said to me once what, of course,\r\nwas a great exaggeration, that if Harrison were to address\r\nan audience of ten thousand men, he would capture them all.\r\nBut if each one of them were presented to him in private,\r\nhe would make him his enemy.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of all this the country was safe with him.\r\nWhile his hand was on the helm she would keep the course of\r\nsafety, of honor, of glory, of prosperity, of republican liberty.\r\nThere would be no fear for the future of the country if we\r\nwere sure to have in the great office of President a succession\r\nof Benjamin Harrisons.\r\n\r\nThis fault of his is a fault apt to beset good and honest\r\nmen, especially when they are under the burden of great anxieties\r\nand cares.  Such men at such times are intent upon the object\r\nto be accomplished.  They are not thinking of personal considerations,\r\nof making friends or allies, or of the impression they are\r\nmaking for themselves upon mankind.  But they need to learn\r\na lesson.  It is a lesson which many of them learn very late\r\nin life, that many a good cause has been jeopardized or lost\r\nby this infirmity of men who are leaders on the righteous\r\nside.  There is written on the walls of one of the great English\r\nschools a legend which I suppose has been there for seven\r\nhundred years:  \"Manners Makyth Man.\" It is a curious fact,\r\nhowever, that this legend illustrates a portrait of a pig.\r\n\r\nBut while public men ought to be made to see how great a thing\r\nthis is, the people ought to learn how little a thing it is--\r\nhow insignificant are these foibles, irritable temper, habits\r\nof personal discourtesy, impatience, even vanity and self-\r\nconfidence, compared with the great things that concern the\r\ncharacter, the welfare, and the glory of the State.  I beg\r\nto assure my readers that I make these observations partly\r\nas a critic and partly as a penitent.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Benjamin Harrison after the Presidential campaign\r\nof 1896, urging him to consent to come to the Senate from\r\nIndiana, citing the example of Presidents Adams and Johnson,\r\nboth of whom came back to public life after they had been\r\nPresident, although Mr. Johnson did not live to render any\r\nservice in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn my letter I expressed my sense of the great value of what\r\nhe had done in the campaign.  In reply I got the following\r\nletter.  Nobody who reads it will doubt that the man who wrote\r\nit had a kind and affectionate heart.\r\n\r\nNovember 10, 1896\r\n  674 NORTH DELAWARE STREET,\r\n  INDIANAPOLIS, IND.\r\n\r\n_My dear Senator:_\r\n\r\nIt is very kind of you to take note of my work in the campaign,\r\nand I value very highly what you say of it--though your friendship\r\nhas perhaps, in some degree, spoiled your judgment.  I am\r\nthoroughly tired of the cares and excitements incident to\r\npublic life in our country.  To you I may say that the people\r\nof this state seem to be more strongly attached to me than\r\never.  I never appear before an audience that I am not deeply\r\nmoved by the demonstrations of the affectionate interest of\r\nmy home people.\r\n\r\nPossibly they would send me to the Senate this winter if I\r\nshould intimate a willingness to take the place, but I do\r\nnot feel that I can, and have said so.\r\n\r\nIf I could believe that any exigency in public affairs called\r\nfor me, then my personal wishes would be subservient--but\r\nit is not so.  My own belief is that as a free citizen I can\r\ndo more towards giving a right direction to public affairs\r\nthan I could as a Senator.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nMy wife joins me in the desire to be kindly remembered to\r\nMrs. Hoar.\r\n\r\n  Most sincerely your friend,\r\n  BENJAMIN HARRISON.\r\n  Hon. George F. Hoar,\r\n  Worcester, Mass.\r\n\r\nI had a great many interesting experiences of Harrison's\r\nroughness of manner and honesty and kindness of heart, which\r\nit would not be right to relate here.  But I may mention two\r\nor three.\r\n\r\nWhen the term of General Corse, the Democratic Postmaster\r\nat Boston, expired, Mr. Dawes and I earnestly recommended\r\nthat he should be reappointed.  He was, with one or two exceptions,\r\nthe most eminent living veteran of the Civil War.  He was\r\nthe hero of one of its noted exploits.  \"Hold the Fort\" had\r\nmade him famous in song and story.  The business men of Boston,\r\nwithout distinction of party, were satisfied with him, and\r\nrecommended that he be continued in the service.  There was\r\nan association of the principal trades, nineteen in number,\r\nin which each trade had three representatives, making fifty-\r\nseven in all.  Of these fifty-four were Republicans, and three\r\nwere Democrats.  Fifty-four, though not the same fifty-four,\r\nrecommended the continuance of General Corse in the service.\r\nHe was recommended by the Republican members from Boston in\r\nthe Massachusetts Senate, and by most of those in the House,\r\nand by several of the Republican members of Congress, whose\r\ndistricts contained a part of the territory served by the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison almost angrily refused to reappoint Corse.\r\nHe said that while Marshals were being murdered in Florida,\r\nand the execution of the law resisted, he would appoint no\r\nman to public office who either sympathized with such things,\r\nor belonged to a party that did not oppose and resist them.\r\nI said to him:  \"Mr. President, how do you reconcile this\r\nwith your declaration that no man would be removed from public\r\noffice for political reasons?\" The President was quite angry,\r\nand showed his anger in his reply.  I said: \"Good morning,\r\nMr. President,\" and took my leave, also quite angry.  But\r\nin a moment or two I went back, and said: \"Mr. President,\r\nif you think there is a man in the country who has a higher\r\nregard for you, or a more sincere desire for your success\r\nthan I have, I will never come here again.\" Mr. Harrison\r\nsaid, very pleasantly, \"I know that very well, Mr. Hoar.\"\r\nAnd the difference ended as quickly as it began.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison sent for me in a few days, and said he\r\nhad made up his mind not to appoint Corse, but would appoint\r\nany Republican I would nominate.  I gave a list of six names,\r\nof which that of Mayor Thomas H. Hart stood at the head.  Next\r\nto him was that of Col. Horace Rockwell.  Next to him was\r\nWm. A. Russell.  I selected Mr. Russell on account of his\r\neminent business capacity, and also because I knew that both\r\nthe President and Postmaster-General had great regard for\r\nhim.  I told him at the same time that I did not believe Mr.\r\nRussell would accept the office.  Next to him was Samuel W.\r\nMcCall, and the fifth name was that of John W. Candler.  Next\r\ncame Congressman Frank W. Rockwell.  A messenger was sent\r\nto Boston that afternoon.  He got there before daylight the\r\nnext morning, and found Mr. Russell was absent on a long\r\njourney to the South.  It was not thought the chances of\r\nhis acceptance made it worth while to keep the office open.\r\nSo it was offered to Mr. Hart, who accepted it.\r\n\r\nPretty soon afterward there came a vacancy in the United\r\nStates Circuit Court for the First Judicial Circuit by the\r\nresignation of Judge Lowell.  I desired to have Judge Putnam,\r\nof Maine, succeed him.  He, too, was a Democrat.  I did not\r\nknow exactly what to do about it, after my experience in the\r\npost-office matter.  So I saw Judge Gray of the Supreme Court,\r\nwho had a high regard for Putnam, and asked him if he would\r\nbe willing to recommend him to the President.  Judge Gray\r\nsaid he would do it if the President applied to him for advice.\r\nBut he was not willing to offer such advice unasked.  He agreed,\r\nhowever, that I might say that Judge Lowell was about to resign,\r\nand that when the matter came up, if the President desired\r\nto know Judge Gray's opinion, he would be very happy to give\r\nit.  The resignation took effect in the vacation of Congress.\r\nThe President invited Judge Gray to come to see him, and\r\ndetermined to accept his advice.  When I got to Washington\r\nin December, President Harrison sent for me and said: \"Mr.\r\nHoar, I have pretty much made up my mind to appoint Judge\r\nPutnam to the Circuit Court, if you approve.\" I said: \"Mr.\r\nPresident, I heartily approve.  But I shall look with some\r\ncuriosity to see how you answer the excellent argument you\r\nmade against the appointment of a Democrat to office when\r\nGeneral Corse's term expired,\" to which Harrison burst out\r\ninto hearty laughter; and both incidents closed.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill for rebuilding the William and Mary College\r\nbuilding, which had been destroyed during the war, was passed,\r\nPresident Tyler and several other gentlemen interested in\r\nthe College, were very anxious lest the President should refuse\r\nto sign it.  They came to Washington to ask me to go with\r\nthem to see him.  This I did.  I told him the history of the\r\nCollege, giving a list of the famous men who were graduated\r\nfrom there.  I spoke of the great affection that had inspired\r\nthe people of Virginia for centuries, and reminded him that\r\nhis own ancestor, General Washington's friend, General Benjamin\r\nHarrison of the Revolution, had been a child of the College,\r\nand I pointed out what a measure of reconcilement it would\r\nbe.  The President listened with a rather disgusted look,\r\nuntil I got through, and just as I rose to take my leave,\r\nsaid:  \"Mr. Hoar, have you got any reasons except sentimental\r\nones?\"  I said I had no others, except those I had stated.\r\nThe gentlemen went out very down-hearted, and said when they\r\ngot out that of course he would veto the bill.  I said: \"I\r\nthink I know the man pretty well, and I think there is more\r\nthan an even chance that he will sign it,\" and he did.\r\n\r\nJust before his term of office ended, he was in the President's\r\nRoom, at the Capitol, to dispose of bills when there was not\r\ntime to take them to the White House before the hour of twelve\r\no'clock, on the 4th of March.  Many measures had been passed\r\nwithin an hour of the time of adjournment, among them a bill\r\nfor the relief of the widow of Jefferson Davis.  She had written\r\na Memoir of her husband, on the sale of which it was understood\r\nshe depended for her livelihood in her advancing years.  But\r\nthe publishers had neglected a technicality which, if the\r\ndecision of one Circuit Judge were good law, made the copyright\r\nvoid.  So she was at the mercy of her publishers, and it was\r\nfeared that they meant to take advantage of the defect.  She\r\napplied through General Gordon, then a member of the Senate,\r\nto Congress for relief.  A bill passed the two Houses, which\r\nI had drawn, providing that where the copies required by law\r\nto be deposited in the Library of Congress, had not been so\r\ndeposited within the time required by law, the author of the\r\nbook might deposit them at a later time, and the copyright\r\nshould not be rendered void.  This was made a general law.\r\nJust before twelve o'clock, when the Senators were in their\r\nseats ready for the inauguration of President Harrison's successor,\r\nwhich was to take place in about ten minutes, General Gordon\r\ncame to me in great distress, saying: \"The Attorney-General\r\nsays the President means to refuse to sign that bill and that\r\nhe can do nothing with him.  Can you help us?\" I had devised\r\nthe plan, and had got it through the Senate.  I went into\r\nthe President's Room with General Gordon and said to the President\r\nthat I wanted to speak to him about that bill, and began my\r\nstory when he broke in upon me, very uncivilly, and said:\r\n\"We cannot pass laws to take care of hard individual cases.\"\r\nI said:  \"No, Mr. President, we cannot pass laws to take care\r\nof individual cases, but where a general law is just and proper,\r\nit is no objection to it that it also affords relief in a\r\ncase of individual injustice.\"  The President made some remark\r\nto the effect that the people of the North would not like\r\nthat we should go out of our way to help the widow of Jefferson\r\nDavis.  I had not told my story, nor stated my reasons.  I\r\nsaid quite angrily:  \"Well, Mr. President, if you will not\r\nhear me, I will stop now.\" I made my bow and withdrew from\r\nthe circle.  The President called after me: \"Mr. Hoar, I\r\nwill hear you.\" Whereupon I told my story.  But there was\r\nno sign of relenting upon his grim countenance.  I went back\r\nto my seat with General Gordon, who had accompanied me.  He\r\ntore off a piece of an order of exercises for the Inauguration,\r\nand handed it to a page, telling him to give it to a friend\r\nof Mrs. Davis, who was outside.  He had written on it: \"He\r\nwon't sign the bill.\"  Just after the page had departed, the\r\nAttorney-General came up and told us that the President had\r\nsigned the bill.  General Gordon called back the page.  I\r\nasked him to give me the torn fragment of the order of exercises,\r\non which he had written the message, which I have kept as\r\na memorial of the transaction, and of him.  Perhaps I may\r\nbe pardoned for adding that General Gordon came to me just\r\nafterward with great emotion, and said, \"Hoar, save my allegiance\r\nto the Democratic Party, I want you to know that you own me.\"\r\n\r\nThese stories may seem trifling.  But such trifles sometimes\r\ngive an idea of the character of men like Harrison more than\r\ntheir greater actions.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison many times thought rashly and spoke hastily.\r\nBut he acted always, so far as I knew, under the impulse of\r\na warm, kind and brave heart, and of a great and wise intellect.\r\n\r\nSome of my Southern brethren have spoken of me with undeserved\r\nkindness in recent years, and they like to say that my heart\r\nhas softened within the last few years, and that I have become\r\nmore tolerant and less harsh and bigoted than I was of old.\r\nSome Northern papers have taken the same view.  What I did\r\nto secure the rebuilding of the William and Mary building,\r\nand to establish the policy of restoring at National cost\r\nall the property of institutions of education, charity and\r\nreligion destroyed at the South, both of which were in the\r\nbeginning opposed by the almost unanimous sentiment of my\r\nparty associates, was done in the first and second terms of\r\nmy service in the House of Representatives, now thirty-five\r\nyears ago.  A Boston newspaper published a series of articles\r\ndenouncing me as a bitter partisan and a bigoted and intolerant\r\nhater of the people of the South, some years ago.  That very\r\nweek I received a letter from Mrs. Jefferson Davis thanking\r\nme for what I had done to save her from privation in her old\r\nage; a telegram from the authorities of William and Mary College,\r\nthanking me for my service in accomplishing the rebuilding\r\nof the College; and a personal call from Judge Howell E. Jackson,\r\nof Tennessee, a Southern Democrat and Confederate, thanking\r\nme for what I had done toward procuring his appointment as\r\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nThese things all happened in the same year, I believe, certainly\r\nin a very short time after I had done what I could to induce\r\nthe reappointment of General Corse and the selection of Judge\r\nPutnam.\r\n\r\nI freely admit that I have believed with all my heart and\r\nsoul in the principles of the Republican Party.  But I think\r\nthere can be found few members of that party who have been\r\nless controlled in their public actions by violent partisanship\r\nthan I have.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\nSATURDAY CLUB\r\n\r\nIn 1877, about the time of my election to the Senate, I was\r\nchosen a member of the famous Saturday Club.  I always attended\r\nthe meetings when I could be in Boston until after the death\r\nof my brother, when every man who was a member when I was\r\nchosen was dead, except Mr. Norton and Judge Gray and the\r\nyounger Agassiz and Mr. Howells, and all of them had ceased\r\nto be constant attendants.\r\n\r\nThey used to meet at the Parker House in Boston once a month.\r\nEach member was at liberty to bring a guest.\r\n\r\nI suppose there was never a merely social club with so many\r\nfamous men in it or another where the conversation was more\r\ndelightful since that to which Johnson and Burke and Goldsmith\r\nand Garrick and Reynolds belonged.  There was plenty of sparkling\r\nwit and repartee and plenty of serious talk from philosophers\r\nand men of letters and science.  Agassiz and Jeffries Wyman\r\nwould sometimes debate Darwin's theory of evolution, which\r\nDarwin had confided to Asa Gray, another member, long before\r\nhe made it known to the public.  Holmes and Lowell contributed\r\ntheir wit, and Judge Hoar, whom Lowell declared the most brilliant\r\nman in conversation he had ever known, his shrewd Yankee sense\r\nand his marvellous store of anecdote.  Some of the greatest\r\nmembers, notably Emerson and Longfellow and Whittier, were\r\nin general quite silent.  But it was worth going a thousand\r\nmiles if but to see one of them, or to hear the tones of his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I suspected Dr. Holmes of getting himself\r\nready for the talk at the dinner as for a lecture.  But I\r\nsoon found that was utterly unjust.  He was always as good\r\nif a new subject were brought up, which he could not have\r\nexpected and which was wholly out of the range of his experience.\r\nHis stream was abundant and sparkling and clear, whenever\r\nyou might tap the cask.  \"Take another glass of wine, Judge,\"\r\nhe said to one of the members who was starting near midnight\r\nto drive twenty miles in the cold rain of autumn, \"Take another\r\nglass of wine; it will shorten the distance and double the\r\nprospect.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes and I were born on the same day of the year, although\r\nI was seventeen years behind him.  I sent to the delightful\r\nAutocrat the following note which reached him on the morning\r\nof his eightieth birthday.\r\n\r\nWORCESTER, Aug. 28th, 89.\r\n\r\n_My dear Dr. Holmes:_  Let me add my salutation to those\r\nof so many of your countrymen, and so many who are not your\r\ncountrymen, save in the republic of letters, on your birthday.\r\nYou may well be amused to think how many political reputations\r\nhave risen and set during your long and sunny reign.  I was\r\nled to think of this by the fact that my own birthday also\r\ncomes Aug. 29th.  But alas!\r\n\r\n  Consules sunt quotannis et novi proconsules,\r\n  Solus aut Rex aut Poeta non quotannis nascitur.\r\n\r\nOf Governors and Senators we have an annual crop.  But Autocrats\r\nand Poets come but once in eighty years.  The asteroids must\r\nnot envy the Georgium Sides his orbit of fourscore years,\r\nbut rather rejoice in his beneficent and cheerful light,\r\nand in the certainty that it will keep on shining so long\r\nas there is a star in the sky.\r\n\r\n  I am\r\n  Faithfully yours\r\n  GEO. F. HOAR.\r\n\r\nI got the following pleasant reply:\r\n\r\nBEVERLY FARMS, MASS., August 30, 1889.\r\n\r\n_My dear Mr. Hoar,_\r\n\r\nYour note of felicitation upon my having reached that \"length\r\nof days\" which Wisdom, if I remember correctly, holds in her\r\nright hand, was the first I received and is the first I answer.\r\nBriefly, of course, but with heartfelt sincerity, for I hardly\r\nthought that you whose hand is on the wheel that governs the\r\ncourse of the Nation, would find time to remember so small\r\nan event as my birthday.\r\n\r\nYou cannot doubt that it was a great pleasure to me to read\r\nyour name at the bottom of a page containing so much that\r\nit was kind in you to write and most agreeable for me to read.\r\n\r\nPlease accept my warmest and most grateful acknowledgments,\r\nand believe me\r\n\r\n  Faithfully yours,\r\n  OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.\r\n\r\nNAMES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SATURDAY CLUB WHEN I\r\nUSED TO ATTEND ITS MEETINGS.\r\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson,      Francis Parkman,\r\n  Edwin P.

The\r\nclub was founded in 1793, before the days of fire-engines,\r\nso that if the house of any of the members caught fire, his\r\nassociates might come to the rescue with buckets and bags\r\nand bed-keys and other apparatus to put out the fire and save\r\nthe property.  But it long since became a mere social club.\r\nIt is limited to thirty members.\r\n\r\nThe elder Levi Lincoln, Mr. Jefferson's intimate friend,\r\nconfidential correspondent and Attorney-General in his Cabinet,\r\norganizer of the political movement which built up Mr. Jefferson's\r\npower in New England in the beginning of the last century,\r\nwas not, I believe, a member of the Society himself.  But\r\nhis sons were, and many of his descendants and connections\r\nby marriage, certainly twelve or fifteen in all.  When the\r\noffice of Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nbecame vacant, by reason of the death of Mr. Justice William\r\nCushing of Massachusetts, September 13, 1809, Levi Lincoln\r\nthe elder was appointed, confirmed by the Senate and commissioned\r\nto fill the vacancy.  Mr. Jefferson earnestly desired and\r\nurged his appointment.  President Madison accompanied the\r\noffer of the office with a letter urging Mr. Lincoln to accept\r\nit in spite of a malady of the eyes from which he was suffering.\r\nMr. Madison says he had got along very well as Attorney-\r\nGeneral and he thinks he would find less inconvenience in\r\ndischarging the duties of Judge.  But Mr. Lincoln declined\r\nthe office.  He lived until 1820, retaining his health and\r\nvigor, except for the trouble with his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was a very able man.  He argued the case in which it was\r\ndecided by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts that slavery\r\nwas abolished in that State by the Constitution, in 1780.\r\n\r\nJudge Story was appointed in his place.  If Mr. Lincoln had\r\naccepted, it is likely that the great judicial fame of Judge\r\nStory would be lacking from American jurisprudence.  Story\r\nwould have devoted himself, probably, to professional or political\r\nlife.  At any rate he would not have been appointed to the\r\nBench before 1820.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that if Lincoln had accepted the seat\r\nupon the Bench, he would have been a thorn in the flesh of\r\nMarshall.  He doubtless shared Mr. Jefferson's dislike for\r\nthe great Chief Justice.  The case of Dartmouth College _v._\r\nWoodward was decided in 1819.  There was in fact but one dissent,\r\nbut any person who reads Shirley's book on the history of\r\nthat case will be inclined to believe that without Judge Story\r\nDartmouth College _v._ Woodward would not have been decided\r\nas it was.\r\n\r\nMore interesting and important is the relation, to Mr. Webster's\r\nseat in the Senate, of the second Levi Lincoln, son of him\r\nof whom I have just spoken, himself a member of the Worcester\r\nClub that has been referred to.  He was Governor of Massachusetts,\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and a Member\r\nof the National House of Representatives.  He was elected\r\nSenator of the United States by one branch of the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature when the term of Elijah H. Mills expired, March\r\n3, 1827.  There can be no doubt that if he had consented he\r\nwould also have been elected by the other house.  Mr. Webster\r\nwas chosen at the next Session.  But before he was elected\r\nhe wrote very strongly urging Mr. Lincoln to accept the office.\r\nHe said in his letter dated May 22, 1827:\r\n\r\n\"I beg to say that I see no way in which the public good\r\ncan be so well promoted as by your consenting to go to the\r\nSenate.  This is my own clear and decided opinion; it is\r\nthe opinion, equally clear and decided, of intelligent and\r\npatriotic friends here, and I am able to add that it is also\r\nthe decided opinion of all those friends elsewhere, whose\r\njudgment in such matters we should naturally regard.  I believe\r\nI may say, without violating confidence, that it is the wish,\r\nentertained with some earnestness, of our friends at Washington,\r\nthat you should consent to be Mr. Mills's successor.  I need\r\nhardly add after what I have said that this is my own wish.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln felt constrained to decline, although the office\r\nwould doubtless have been very agreeable to him, by reason\r\nof some statements he had made when elected Governor that\r\nhe should not be a candidate for the Senate.  Mr. Lincoln\r\nmight, without dishonor or even indelicacy, have accepted\r\nthe office in spite of those utterances.  It was quite clear\r\nthat all the persons who might be supposed to have acted\r\nupon them, desired his election when the time came on.  But\r\nhe was a man of scrupulous honor and did not mean to leave\r\nany room for the imputation that he did not regard what is\r\ndue to \"consistency of character,\" to use his own phrase.\r\nNow if Mr. Lincoln would have accepted the office it is likely\r\nthat he would have held it until his death in 1868.  At any\r\nrate it is quite certain that he would have held it until\r\nthe political revolution of 1851.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear to me that the office of Senator was at\r\nMr. Lincoln's command.  Observe that this was in 1827, and\r\nwas the election for the term of six years, ending March 3,\r\n1833.  That includes the period of Jackson's great contest\r\nwith Nullification, when Mr. Webster, with all his power,\r\ncame to Jackson's support.  It includes the time of the Reply\r\nto Hayne, and the great debate with Calhoun.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster, I need not say, would have been a great figure\r\nanywhere.  But if Mr. Lincoln had acted otherwise, there would\r\nhave been absent from our history and literature Webster's\r\nReply to Hayne, the support of Jackson in the day of Nullification,\r\nthe debate with Calhoun including the speech, \"The Constitution\r\nnot a Compact between Sovereign States,\" and the powerful\r\nattack on Jackson's assertion of power in the removal of the\r\ndeposits.  The speech on the President's Protest, with the\r\nwonderful passage describing the power of England, would not\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nIf the sentiment of Patriotism, and love of Liberty and Union\r\nare to be dominant in this Republic, we cannot measure the\r\nvalue of the influence of Daniel Webster and the speech in\r\nreply to Hayne.  I am not sure that, without Mr. Webster's\r\npowerful championship of the side which prevailed, Mr. Calhoun's\r\ntheory would not have become established.  At any rate, it\r\nwas the fortune of Daniel Webster that the doctrine of National\r\nUnity, whenever it has prevailed in the hearts of his countrymen,\r\nhas been supported by his argument and clothed in his language.\r\n\r\nAnother incident of the same kind, not of like importance\r\nto those of which I have told, but still of a good deal of\r\ninterest and importance, happened more lately.  I had a good\r\ndeal to do with it myself.\r\n\r\nWhen President Hayes entered upon office, there were but three\r\nmembers of the Senate of either party who were supporters\r\nof his Administration.  I was one of them.  The other two\r\nwere my colleague, Mr. Dawes, and Stanley Matthews of Ohio.\r\nPresident Hayes was, in my opinion, a very wise and able and\r\nupright man.  It was an admirable Administration.  He had\r\na strong and excellent Cabinet.  But his nomination had disappointed\r\nthe ambitions of some very influential men in his own party,\r\nand the powerful factions of which they were the leaders and\r\ncandidates.  The opposing party had not only felt the usual\r\ndisappointment in defeat, but denied the lawfulness of his\r\nelection.  So I was more familiar than would ordinarily have\r\nbeen likely to have been the case with all the councils of\r\nhis Administration.  The Secretary of State was my near kinsman,\r\nand the Attorney-General had been my law partner.\r\n\r\nWhen the vacancy occurred in the English mission by the resignation\r\nof Mr. John Welsh, I very strongly urged the appointment of\r\nMr. Lowell.  Mr. Evarts was quite unwilling to select Mr.\r\nLowell, and in deference to his wishes, President Hayes offered\r\nthe place to several other persons, including myself.  The\r\noffer was communicated to me by Mr. Evarts who was, at that\r\ntime, Secretary of State.  But there were many good reasons\r\nwhy I could not accept it.  The offer was made to Governor\r\nAlexander H. Bullock, a member of the little society of which\r\nI have spoken.  I was myself authorized by the President to\r\ncommunicate his desire to Governor Bullock.  His answer, declining\r\nof account of the condition of his family, will be found in\r\nthe life prefixed to the published volume of his speeches.\r\n\r\nNow, if Governor Bullock had accepted the appointment, which\r\nwas undoubtedly very attractive to him, what Mr. Lowell did\r\nin England would not have been done.  He will doubtless go\r\ndown in literature as a great poet.  But it seems to me he\r\nis entitled to an equal rank among the prose writers of the\r\ncountry, and indeed among the prose writers of the English\r\nlanguage of our time.  His admirable address on Democracy,\r\nthe delightful address as President of the Wordsworth Society,\r\nseveral estimates of the British poets, delivered by him on\r\nvarious occasions in England when he was Minister there, are\r\namong the very best examples of his work in prose.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nIt was upon Mr. Sherman's motion that the words, \"Common Defence\r\nand General Welfare,\" which have played so important a part\r\nin the construction of the Constitution, were introduced into\r\nthat instrument.  He proposed to add to the taxing clause\r\nthe words, \"for the payment of said debts and for the defraying\r\nof expenses that shall be incurred for the defence and general\r\nwelfare.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition, according to Mr. Madison, was disagreed\r\nto as being unnecessary.  It then obtained only the single\r\nvote of Connecticut.  But three days afterward Mr. Sherman\r\nmoved and obtained the appointment of a Committee, of which\r\nhe was a member, to which this and several subjects were committed.\r\nThat Committee reported the clause in the shape in which it\r\nnow stands, and it was adopted unanimously.\r\n\r\nIts adoption is an instance of Mr. Sherman's great tenacity,\r\nand his power to bring the body, of which he was a member,\r\nto his own way of thinking in the end, however unwilling in\r\nthe beginning.  This phrase had played not only an important\r\nbut a decisive part in the great debate between a strict construction\r\nof the Constitution and the construction which has prevailed\r\nand made it the law of the being of a great National life.\r\n\r\nThis story is well told in Farrar's \"Manual of the Constitution,\"\r\npages 110, 309, 324.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nRoger Minott Sherman, son of Roger Sherman's brother Josiah,\r\nwas born in Woburn, Mass., May 22, 1773.  Mr. Sherman was\r\nmuch attached to him and defrayed the cost of his education.\r\nHe was an inmate of his uncle's family while a student at\r\nYale College.  He was graduated in the year 1792.  He was\r\none of the ablest lawyers and advocates New England ever produced,\r\nprobably having no equal at the Bar of New England except\r\nJeremiah Mason and Daniel Webster.  I attended a dinner of\r\nthe Alumni of Yale College some years ago.  President Woolsey\r\nsat on one side of me, and Dr. Leonard Bacon on the other;\r\nand right opposite at the table was Rev. Dr. Atwater, then\r\nI believe of Princeton, but formerly Mr. Sherman's pastor in\r\nFairfield.  President Woolsey said that Roger Minott Sherman\r\ncame nearer his conception of Cicero than any other person\r\nhe ever heard speak.  They used frequently to invite him to\r\ndeliver public addresses at the College.  But he never would\r\naccept the invitation.  After refusal, the invitation would\r\nbe renewed again after a few years with like result.\r\n\r\nTo the above estimate of Mr. Sherman, Dr. Bacon and Mr. Atwater\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the Law School at Harvard, Professor Simon Greenleaf\r\ntold the class in one of his lectures that he was once travelling\r\nthrough Connecticut in a carriage on a summer journey, and\r\ncame to a town, I think Fairfield, which was the county seat.\r\nHe stopped to get his dinner and rest his horses.  While the\r\nhorses were being fed he went into the court-house, intending\r\nto stay only a few minutes, and found Roger Minott Sherman\r\narguing a case before the Supreme Court with Judge Gould on\r\nthe other side.  He was much impressed by Mr. Sherman's clear\r\nand powerful argument.  Mr. Sherman and Judge Gould were\r\nengaged on opposite sides in nearly all the cases.  Professor\r\nGreenleaf was so much interested by what he heard that he\r\nremained and attended court during the entire week.  I do\r\nnot remember his exact language, but he, in substance, gave\r\nan estimate of Mr. Sherman as a profound lawyer and able advocate,\r\nnot less exalted than President Woolsey had given of him as\r\nan orator.\r\n\r\nSome slight account of Roger Minott Sherman will be found\r\nin Goodrich's \"Recollections.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Evarts once told me that there was an important controversy,\r\ninvolving the title to a valuable cargo, in which a lawyer\r\nin Hartford was on one side, and a member of the Bar of the\r\ncity of New York on the other.  The New York lawyer went to\r\nHartford to negotiate about the case.  The Hartford lawyer\r\nhad obtained the opinion of Roger Minott Sherman for his client\r\nand held it in his hand during the conversation, labelled\r\non the outside, \"Opinion of Roger Minott Sherman,\" and moved\r\nit about under the eye of his opponent.  The opinion was in\r\nfact that the Hartford man's client had no case.  But the\r\nNew York lawyer supposed that if the man had got Roger Minott\r\nSherman's opinion, and seemed to set so much store upon the\r\ndocument, it was favorable to the party who had consulted\r\nhim.  He was much alarmed and settled the case on favorable\r\nterms to his antagonist.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman was famous for his quickness of wit.  A story\r\nwent the rounds of the papers in my youth, which may or may\r\nnot have any truth in it, but which I will record.  It is\r\nsaid that he was once arguing a case against Nathan Smith,\r\na very able but rather coarse lawyer.  Mr. Smith had discussed\r\nthe question of law with the subtilty for which he was distinguished.\r\nMr. Sherman said to the court that he thought his brother\r\nSmith's metaphysics were out of place in that discussion;\r\nthat he was not adverse to such refinement at a proper time,\r\nand would willingly, on a fit occasion, chop logic and split\r\nhairs with him.  Smith pulled a hair out of his own head,\r\nand holding it up, said,--\"Split that.\" Sherman replied, quick\r\nas lightning, \"May it please your Honor, I didn't say bristles.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the passage referred to from S. G. Goodrich's\r\n\"Recollections of a Lifetime\":\r\n\r\n\"Roger Minott Sherman was distinguished for acute logical\r\npowers and great elegance of diction,--words and sentences\r\nseemed to flow from his lips as if he were reading from the\r\n_Spectator._  He was a man of refined personal appearance\r\nand manners; tall, stooping a little in his walk; deliberate\r\nin his movements and speech, indicating circumspection, which\r\nwas one of his characteristics.  His countenance was pale\r\nand thoughtful, his eye remarkable for a keen penetrating\r\nexpression.  Though a man of grave general aspect, he was\r\nnot destitute of humor.  He was once travelling in western\r\nVirginia, and stopping at a small tavern, was beset with questions\r\nby the landlord, as to where he came from, whither he was\r\ngoing, etc.  At last said Mr. Sherman, 'Sit down, sir, and\r\nI will tell you all about it.' The landlord sat down.  'Sir,'\r\nsaid he, 'I am from the Blue Light State of Connecticut.'\r\nThe landlord stared.  'I am a deacon in a Calvinistic church.'\r\nThe landlord was evidently shocked.  'I was a member of the\r\nHartford Convention.' This was too much for the democratic\r\nnerves of the landlord; he speedily departed, and left his\r\nlodger to himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Frontispiece:  v2.jpg]\r\n\r\n[Title page]\r\nAUTOBIOGRAPHY\r\nOF SEVENTY YEARS\r\n\r\nBY\r\nGEORGE F.

Before the convention was called to order the\r\ndelegates crowded around me and urged me to reconsider my\r\nrefusal to stand for another term, and declared they would\r\ngladly nominate me again.  But I persisted in my refusal.\r\nI supposed then that my political career was ended.  My home\r\nand my profession and my library had an infinite attraction\r\nfor me.  I had become thoroughly sick of Washington and politics\r\nand public life.\r\n\r\nBut the Republican Party in Massachusetts was having a death\r\nstruggle with General Butler.  That very able, adroit and\r\nambitious man was attempting to organize the political forces\r\nof the State into a Butler party, and to make them the instrument\r\nof his ambitions.  He had in some mysterious way got the ear\r\nof General Grant and the control of the political patronage\r\nof the State, so far as the United States offices were concerned.\r\nI had denounced him and his methods with all my might in a\r\nletter I had written to the people of Massachusetts, from\r\nwhich I have already made extracts.  I had incurred his bitter\r\npersonal enmity, and was regarded with perhaps one exception,\r\nthat of my older brother Judge Hoar, as his most unrelenting\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThe people of Massachusetts were never an office-seeking\r\npeople.  There is no State in the Union whose representatives\r\nat the seat of Government have less trouble in that way, or\r\nthat gives less trouble to the Executive Departments or to\r\nthe President.  I have had that assurance from nearly every\r\nPresident since I have been in public life.  And the people\r\nof Massachusetts have never concerned themselves very much\r\nas to who should hold the Executive offices, small or large,\r\nso that they were honestly and faithfully served, and that\r\nthe man appointed was of good character and standing.  The\r\nreform which took the civil service out of politics always\r\nfound great favor in Massachusetts.  But since General Butler,\r\nin some way never fully explained to the public, got the ear\r\nof the appointing power he seemed to be filling all the Departments\r\nat Washington with his adherents, especially the important\r\nplaces in the Treasury.  The public indignation was deeply\r\naroused.  Men dreaded to read the morning papers lest they\r\nshould see the announcement of the removal from the public\r\nservice of some honest citizen, or brave soldier, who was\r\nfilling the place of postmaster or marshal, or Custom House\r\nofficial, or clerk in a Department at Washington, and the\r\nputting in his place some unscrupulous follower of the fortunes\r\nof General Butler.  The climax was reached when Butler's chief\r\nlieutenant, Simmons, was appointed Collector of the Port of\r\nBoston.  Judge Russell, the old Collector, was an able and\r\nvery popular man.  He had given Butler a sort of half-hearted\r\nsupport.  But he was incapable of lending himself to any base\r\nor unworthy purpose.  He was compelled to vacate the office,\r\nmuch to his disgust.  He accepted that of Minister to Venezuela,\r\nan unimportant foreign mission, and William A. Simmons was\r\nappointed in his place.  The process of weeding out the Custom\r\nHouse then went on with great rapidity.  Colonel Moulton,\r\none of the bravest soldiers of the Civil War, who had been\r\nunder rebel fire in a Charleston dungeon, and Colonel A. A.\r\nSherman, a man with a marvellous military record, were removed\r\nto make way for men for whom, to say the least, the public\r\nhad no respect.  The order for their removal was recalled\r\nin consequence of a direct appeal to President Grant.  Mr.\r\nHartwell, the Treasurer, an excellent officer, who had graduated\r\nthe first scholar at Harvard, was removed.  Mrs. Chenoweth,\r\na very accomplished lady, widow of one of the bravest officers\r\nof the Civil War, a member of Grant's staff, who was filling\r\na clerical position at the Custom House, was notified of her\r\nremoval.  That also was arrested by a direct appeal to Grant.\r\nGeneral Andrews, one of our best officers, afterwards professor\r\nat West Point, was dropped from the office of Marshal, and\r\none of the adherents of Butler put in his place.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of the better class of Republicans was aroused.\r\nBefore the appointment of Simmons, Mr. Boutwell had been elected\r\nSenator, and Mr. Richardson had succeeded him as Secretary\r\nof the Treasury.  Mr. Boutwell was a favorite with the President.\r\nMr. Sumner, then the senior Senator, was on the most unfriendly\r\nrelations with the President, and had opposed his reelection\r\nto the best of his ability.  It was not considered likely,\r\nunder the custom then universally prevailing and indeed prevailing\r\never since, that President Grant would ever have made such\r\nan appointment without the entire approval of the Senator\r\nfrom the State interested, with whom he was on most friendly\r\nterms and who had served in his Cabinet as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.  Governor Boutwell was consulted about it, and gave\r\nit his approval, although it is understood that afterward,\r\nin obedience to the indignant feeling of the people, which\r\nwas deeply excited, he voted against the confirmation of Simmons\r\nin the Senate.  At the same time he informed his associates\r\nthat he did not wish to have them understand that he requested\r\nthem to vote against Simmons because of his opposition, or\r\nbecause of any so-called courtesy of the Senate.  Simmons\r\nwas the manager of Mr. Boutwell's campaign for reelection,\r\nand General Butler was his earnest supporter, giving him notice\r\nand urging him to repair at once to Boston when the movement\r\nagainst him became formidable.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that but for the determination of the people\r\nof Massachusetts not to endure Butler and Butlerism any longer,\r\nand probably but for the appointment of Simmons, I should\r\nnever have been elected Senator.  It is likely there would\r\nhave been no change in the office until this moment.\r\n\r\nWhen I left home for Washington at the beginning of the December\r\nsession of Congress in 1876, the late Adin Thayer told me\r\nthat some of the Republicans had got sick of Butler's rule,\r\nand they were determined to have a candidate for Senator who\r\ncould be trusted to make zealous opposition to him and his\r\nmethods, and that they proposed to use my name.  I told him\r\nI did not believe they would be able to get twenty-five votes,\r\nthat Mr. Boutwell, then Senator, was an able man, and that\r\nI did not think the fact even that he was understood to be\r\na strong friend and ally of General Butler would induce the\r\npeople to displace him.  Mr. Thayer replied that at any rate\r\nthere should be a protest.\r\n\r\nI had no communication from any other human being upon the\r\nsubject of my candidacy for the Senate, and made none to any\r\nhuman being, with one exception, until my election by the\r\nLegislature was announced.  My oldest sister was fatally sick,\r\nand I received a letter every day giving an account of her\r\ncondition.  In a postscript to one letter from my brother,\r\nhe made some slight allusion to the election for Senator then\r\npending in the Massachusetts Legislature.  But with that exception\r\nI never heard about it and had nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nI can truly say that I was as indifferent to the result, so\r\nfar as it affected me personally, as to the question whether\r\nI should walk on one side of the street or the other.  I did\r\nnot undervalue the great honor of representing Massachusetts\r\nin the Senate of the United States.  But I had an infinite\r\nlonging for my home and my profession and my library.  I never\r\nfound public employment pleasant or congenial.  But the fates\r\nsent me to the Senate and have kept me there until I am now\r\nthe man longest in continuous legislative service in this\r\ncountry, and have served in the United States Senate longer\r\nthan any other man who ever represented Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe last three times I have been elected to the Senate I\r\nhave had, I believe, every Republican vote of the Legislature,\r\nand I was assured--of course I cannot speak with much confidence\r\nof such a matter--that I could have all the Democratic votes,\r\nif necessary.  I state these things with a feeling of natural\r\npride.  But I do not attribute it to any special merit of\r\nmine.  It has been the custom of Massachusetts to continue\r\nher Senators in public life so long as they were willing,\r\nand were in general accord with the political opinion of the\r\nmajority of the people.\r\n\r\nI have, however, owed very much indeed to the moderation\r\nand kindness of the eminent gentlemen who might have been\r\nmost formidable competitors, if they had thought fit.  Just\r\nbefore the election of 1883, when all the discontented elements\r\nwere seeking a candidate, General Francis A. Walker, one\r\nof the ablest men ever born on the soil so productive of good\r\nand able men, was proposed as my competitor.  He would have\r\nhad a great support.  I think he would have liked the service,\r\nfor which he was so eminently fitted.  He had been my pupil,\r\nand had gone from my office to the War.  He came out promptly\r\nin a letter in which he declared that in his judgment Mr.\r\nHoar was the fittest person in the Commonwealth for the office\r\nof Senator.  Governor Long was my Republican competitor in\r\n1883.  But on two or three occasions since, when he was proposed\r\nin many quarters for the office of Senator, he promptly refused\r\nto have his name submitted to the Legislature, and declared\r\nhimself for me.  He is a man of brilliant ability, and a great\r\nfavorite with the people of the Commonwealth.  General William\r\nF. Draper, lately Ambassador to Italy, a most distinguished\r\nsoldier, a business man of great sagacity and success, having\r\ninherited from his father a right to the regard of the people--\r\na regard which has been extended not only to him, but also\r\nto his very able and excellent brothers--more than once when\r\nthere has been an election of Senator, has been proposed in\r\nmany quarters.  He has promptly, both in letter and in public\r\ninterviews, rejected the suggestion, finally with impatience\r\nthat he was put to the trouble of repeating himself in the\r\nmatter so often.\r\n\r\nI think that in any other State than Massachusetts, and even\r\nthere, without the great kindness and moderation of these\r\ngentlemen, my tenure of office, which will have continued\r\nfor thirty-eight years, if my life be spared, would have been\r\nmuch shorter.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner was in general accord with the Republicans of Massachusetts\r\non important questions in issue in his time.  But he bitterly\r\nand savagely attacked President Grant at the height of his\r\npopularity, and did his best to defeat him for reelection.\r\nHe allowed his name to be used as candidate for Governor,\r\nagainst Governor Washburn.  The defeat of Grant would, of\r\ncourse, have caused that of Henry Wilson, candidate for the\r\nVice-Presidency.  Still I have no doubt that if Mr. Sumner\r\nhad lived, he would have been reelected to the Senate without\r\nany very formidable opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nPRESIDENT HAYES\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes's Administration began under circumstances\r\nof peculiar difficulty.  In the first Congress of his term\r\nthe Democrats had a majority in the House.  They had refused\r\nto pass the Army Appropriation Bill the winter before and\r\nwould not consent to such a bill in the following winter without\r\na condition that no military force should be used to maintain\r\norder at elections, or to keep in power state governments\r\nobnoxious to them.  But his worst foes were of his own household.\r\nThere were two factions among the Republicans, one led by\r\nMr. Blaine and the other by Conkling and Cameron.  Blaine\r\nand Conkling had been disappointed aspirants for the Presidency.\r\nMr. Hayes and his advisers were in favor of what was called\r\nreform in the civil service and utterly rejected the claim\r\nof Senators and Representatives to dictate nominations to\r\nexecutive and judicial offices.  With the exception of Stanley\r\nMatthews of Ohio and my colleague, Mr. Dawes, I was, I believe,\r\nthe only cordial supporter of the President in the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was disposed, I think, in the beginning, to give\r\nthe President his support.  But he was rendered exceedingly\r\nindignant by the refusal of President Hayes to appoint Mr.\r\nFrye to a seat in the Cabinet, which Mr. Blaine desired, as\r\nit would smooth the way of Mr. Eugene Hale, his most intimate\r\nfriend and strongest supporter, to succeed Mr. Hamlin in\r\nthe Senate.  President Hayes was willing to appoint Mr. Hale\r\nto a Cabinet office.  But Mr. Hale, I think very wisely, declined\r\nthe overture, as he had before declined the tender of a seat\r\nin the Cabinet from President Grant.  He would have made an\r\nexcellent Cabinet officer.  But he was specially fitted for\r\nthe more agreeable and permanent public service of Senator.\r\nI do not know what occasioned President Hayes's reluctance\r\nto comply with Mr. Blaine's desire.  But it was a fortunate\r\ndecision for Mr. Frye.  If he had gone into the Cabinet,\r\nin all likelihood the people of Maine would have chosen another\r\nSenator when Mr. Blaine became Secretary of State under Garfield\r\nin 1881, and according to the habit of the people of that\r\nState would have continued him in their service.  So Mr.\r\nFrye's brilliant and useful career in the Senate would have\r\nbeen wanting to the history of the Republic.\r\n\r\nI had myself something to do with the selection of the Cabinet.\r\nI had been a member of the Convention held at Cincinnati that\r\nhad nominated President Hayes.  The Massachusetts delegation\r\nhad turned the scale between him and Blaine.  Their votes\r\ngave him the slender majority to which he owed his nomination.\r\nI had also been a member of the Electoral Commission to which\r\nthe contest between him and Tilden had been submitted and\r\nI had been on the committee that framed the bill under which\r\nthat Commission was created.  I had voted with the Democrats\r\nof the House to support that bill against the judgment of\r\na large majority of the Republicans.  I agreed with President\r\nHayes in the matter of a reform in the civil service and in\r\nhis desire to free the Executive power from the trammel of\r\nsenatorial dictation.\r\n\r\nI had formed a strong friendship with Mr. McCrary in the House\r\nof Representatives and had earnestly commended him to the\r\nPresident for appointment to the office of Attorney-General.\r\nI did not expect to make any other recommendation.  There\r\nhad been an unfortunate estrangement between the Republicans\r\nof Massachusetts and of Maine by reason of the refusal of\r\nthe Massachusetts delegation to support Mr. Blaine for the\r\nPresidency.  I thought it desirable for the interest of the\r\nRepublican Party that that breach should be healed and especially\r\ndesirable that the incoming administration, so beset with\r\ndifficulty, should have the powerful support of Mr. Blaine\r\nand of those Republicans of whom he was the leader and favorite.\r\nSo I thought it best that he should be consulted in the matter\r\nof the selection of a Cabinet officer from New England and\r\nthat I should keep aloof.\r\n\r\nBut the day after President Hayes's inauguration, rather\r\nlate in the afternoon, Mr. Blaine came into the Senate Chamber\r\nand told me with some appearance of excitement that he thought\r\nthe President wanted to see the Massachusetts Senators.  I\r\ndid not, however, act upon that message, and did not go to\r\nthe White House that day.  I was at my room in the evening\r\nwhen Senator Morrill of Vermont came and told me that President\r\nHayes wished him to inquire of me what Massachusetts man I\r\ndesired to have appointed to a place in the Cabinet.  I told\r\nMr. Morrill that there were two gentlemen of great capacity\r\nand high character, either of whom would make an excellent\r\nCabinet officer.  One of them was William B. Washburn, and\r\nthe other Alexander H. Rice.  Each of them had held the office\r\nof Governor of the Commonwealth, and each of them had been\r\na very eminent member of the House of Representatives.  But\r\nI said that each belonged to what might be called a separate\r\nfaction or division in the Republican Party, and the appointment\r\nof either would be distasteful to some of the supporters of\r\nthe other.  I added that there was one man of whom I thought\r\nvery highly indeed, an intimate friend of mine, whose appointment\r\nI thought would give pleasure to everybody in Massachusetts.\r\nThat was General Charles Devens, then Judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt, a very eminent advocate and orator, and one of the\r\nmost distinguished soldiers the State had sent into the war.\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill went back to the President with the message.\r\nEarly the next morning I received notice from the White\r\nHouse that the President wished to see me.  I complied with\r\nhis desire at once.  Mr. Dawes had also been sent for and\r\nwas there.  The President said he could offer General Devens\r\nthe Department of War, or perhaps the Navy.  Mr. Dawes thought\r\nthat he would not be willing to accept the latter.  I told\r\nthe President that I thought he would; that General Devens\r\nwas a native of Charlestown.  He had always taken a great\r\ninterest in the Navy.  He had known a great many of the old\r\nand famous naval officers, and some of his near relatives\r\nhad been in that service.  But the President finally authorized\r\nme to send a telegram to General Devens offering him the Department\r\nof War.  I sent the telegram and requested Devens to come\r\nat once to Washington, which he did.  At the same time, the\r\nPresident stated his purpose to offer Mr. McCrary the Department\r\nof Justice.  In the course of the day, however, it was reported\r\nto the President that Mr. McCrary had formed a decided opinion\r\nin favor of the McGarrahan claim, a claim which affected large\r\nand valuable mining properties in California.  Most persons\r\nwho had investigated the claim believed it to be utterly fraudulent.\r\nThere were many persons of great influence who were interested\r\nin the mining property affected.  They strongly appealed to\r\nthe President not to place in the office of Attorney-General\r\na man who was committed in favor of the claim.  The President\r\nthen asked me if I thought General Devens would be willing\r\nto accept the office of Attorney-General, and exchange it\r\nfor that of Secretary of War later, when the McGarrahan claim\r\nhad been disposed of so far as Executive action was concerned.\r\nI told the President that I thought he would.  When General\r\nDevens arrived I stated the case to him.  He said he should\r\nbe unwilling to agree to such an arrangement.  He would be\r\nwilling to accept the office in the beginning, but if he were\r\nto give up the office of Attorney-General after having once\r\nundertaken it, he might be thought to have failed to discharge\r\nhis duties to the satisfaction of the President, or that of\r\nthe public.  He was unwilling to take that risk.\r\n\r\nSo the President determined to offer the Department of Justice\r\nto General Devens, and the Department of War to Mr. McCrary,\r\na good deal to the disappointment of the latter.  All McCrary's\r\nambitions in life were connected with his profession.  He\r\ntook the first opportunity to leave the Executive Department\r\nfor a judicial career.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the Cabinet were:  William M. Evarts,\r\nSecretary of State; John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury;\r\nCarl Schurz, Secretary of the Interior; David M. Key, Postmaster-\r\nGeneral; Richard M. Thompson, of Indiana, Secretary of the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes was a simple-hearted, sincere, strong and\r\nwise man.  He is the only President of the United States who\r\npromised, when he was a candidate for office, not to be a\r\ncandidate again, who kept his pledge.  He carried out the\r\nprinciples of Civil Service Reform more faithfully than any\r\nother President before or since down to the accession of President\r\nRoosevelt.  General Grant in his \"Memoirs\" praises the soldierly\r\nquality of President Hayes very highly.  He was made Brigadier-\r\nGeneral on the recommendation of Sheridan, and brevetted Major-\r\nGeneral for gallant and distinguished services.  He wrote,\r\nafter the Presidential election, to John Sherman, as follows:\r\n\"You feel, I am sure, as I do about this whole business.  A\r\nfair election would have given us about forty electoral votes\r\nat the South, at least that many; but we must not allow our\r\nfriends to defeat one outrage by another.  There must be\r\nnothing curved on our part.  Let Mr. Tilden have the place\r\nby violence, intimidation and fraud rather than undertake\r\nto prevent it by means that will not bear the severest scrutiny.\"\r\n\r\nHe upheld the good faith of the nation in his veto of the\r\nbill to authorize the coinage of the silver dollar of 412-1/2\r\ngrains, and to restore its legal tender character in 1879; and\r\nin his veto of the bill violating our treaty with China.  He\r\ngrew steadily in public favor with all parties, and with all\r\nparts of the country, as his Administration went on.  Under\r\nhis Administration the resumption of specie payments was accomplished;\r\nand, in spite of the great difficulties caused by the factional\r\nopposition in his own party, he handed down his office to\r\na Republican successor.\r\n\r\nThe weakness and folly of the charge against the decision\r\nof the Electoral Commission, that it was unconstitutional\r\nor fraudulent, and the fact that the American people were\r\nnever impressed by these charges, is shown by the fact that\r\nGeneral Garfield, one of the majority who gave that decision,\r\nwas elected to succeed President Hayes, and that six of the\r\neight members of that majority, now dead, maintained, every\r\none them, throughout their honored and useful lives, the respect\r\nand affection of their countrymen, without distinction of\r\nparty.  Certainly there can be found among the great men of\r\nthat great generation no more pure and brilliant lights than\r\nSamuel F. Miller, William Strong, Joseph P. Bradley, Frederick\r\nT. Frelinghuysen, Oliver P. Morton and James A. Garfield.\r\nThere are two survivors of that majority, Mr. Edmunds and\r\nmyself.  Neither has found that the respect in which his countrymen\r\nheld him has been diminished by that decision.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes has been accused of abandoning the reconstruction\r\npolicy of his party.  It has also been said that he showed\r\na want of courage in failing to support the Republican State\r\nGovernments in Louisiana and South Carolina; that if the votes\r\nof those States were cast for him they were cast for Packard\r\nand Chamberlain at the elections for Governor held the same\r\nday, and that he should have declined the Presidency, or have\r\nmaintained these Governors in place.  But these charges are,\r\nat the least, inconsiderate, not the say ignorant.  It ought\r\nto be said also that President Grant before he left office\r\nhad determined to do in regard to these State Governments\r\nexactly what Hayes afterward did, and that Hayes acted with\r\nhis full approval.  Second, I have the authority of President\r\nGarfield for saying that Mr. Blaine had come to the same\r\nconclusion.  The Monday morning after the electoral count\r\nhad been completed and the result declared, Blaine had a long\r\ntalk with Garfield, which Garfield reported to me.  He told\r\nhim that he had made up his mind, if he had been elected,\r\nto offer the office of Secretary of State to Mr. Evarts,\r\nor, if anything prevented that, to Judge Hoar.  He further\r\nsaid that he thought it was time to discontinue maintaining\r\nRepublican State Governments in office by the National power\r\nand that the people of the Southern States must settle their\r\nState elections for themselves.  Mr. Blaine by his disappointment\r\nin the formation of President Hayes's Cabinet was induced\r\nto make an attack on him which seems inconsistent with this\r\ndeclaration.  But Mr. Blaine soon abandoned this ground,\r\nand, so far as I now remember, never afterward advocated interference\r\nwith the control of the Southern States by National authority.\r\nIt seems to me that President Hayes did only what his duty\r\nunder the Constitution peremptorily demanded of him.  I entirely\r\napproved his conduct at the time, and, so far as I know and\r\nbelieve, he agreed exactly with the doctrine on which I always\r\nmyself acted before and since.  The power and duty of the\r\nPresident are conferred and limited by the Constitution.  The\r\nConstitution requires that no appropriation shall be made\r\nfor the support of the Army for more than two years.  In practice\r\nthe appropriation is never for more than one year.  That is\r\nfor the express purpose, I have always believed, of giving\r\nto Congress, especially to the House of Representatives, which\r\nmust inaugurate all appropriation bills, absolute control\r\nover the use of the Army, and the power to determine for what\r\npurposes the military power shall be used.  At the session\r\nbefore President Hayes's inauguration the Democratic House\r\nof Representatives had refused to pass an Army Bill.  The\r\nHouse refused to pass an Army Bill the next year, except on\r\ncondition that the soldiers should not be used to support\r\nthe State Government.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary to call a special session of Congress\r\nin October, 1877, by reason of the failure of the Army Appropriation\r\nBill the winter before.  The first chapter of the Statutes\r\nof that session, being an act making appropriations for the\r\nsupport of the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878,\r\nand for other purposes, enacts \"that none of the money hereby\r\nappropriated shall be expended, directly or indirectly, for\r\nany use not strictly necessary for, and directly connected\r\nwith, the military service of the Government; and this restriction\r\nshall apply to the use of public animals, forage, and vehicles.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, President Hayes's Constitutional duty,\r\nin my judgment, to desist from using the military power of\r\nthe Government on the 30th day of June, 1877, when the fiscal\r\nyear expired for which there was an appropriation for the\r\nsupport of the Army.  In fact he removed the troops a little\r\nearlier.  But he received assurances from the Democratic leaders--\r\nwhether they were made good I will not now undertake to inquire--\r\nthat there should be no unlawful force on their part after\r\nthe removal of the troops.  Mr. Hayes was right and wise\r\nin securing this stipulation if he could, by freeing these\r\ncommunities from military grasp a few weeks before he would\r\nhave been compelled to do it at any rate.  Obedience to this\r\nclear mandate of Constitutional duty was not in the least\r\ninconsistent with a faithful and vigorous use of all the other\r\npowers which were lodged in his hands by the Constitution\r\nfor securing the rights of the colored people, or the purity\r\nand integrity of National elections.  It is true that substantially\r\nthe same vote elected Packard of Louisiana as that which chose\r\nthe Hayes electors.  But the authority to declare who is the\r\nPresident lawfully chosen, and the Constitutional power to\r\nmaintain the Governor in his seat by force are lodged in\r\nvery different hands.  The latter can only be used by the\r\nNational Executive under the circumstances specially described\r\nin the Constitution, and it can never be used by him for any\r\nconsiderable period of time contrary to the will of Congress,\r\nand without powers put in his hands by legislation which must\r\noriginate in the body which represents the people.\r\n\r\nThe infinite sweetness and tact of his wife contributed greatly\r\nto the success of the Administration of President Hayes.  She\r\nwas a woman of great personal beauty.  Her kindness of heart\r\nknew no difference between the most illustrious and the humblest\r\nof her guests.  She accomplished what would have been impossible\r\nto most women, the maintenance of a gracious and delightful\r\nhospitality while strictly adhering to her principles of total\r\nabstinence, and rigorously excluding all wines and intoxicating\r\nliquors from the White House during her administration.  The\r\nold wine drinkers of Washington did not take to the innovation\r\nvery kindly.  But they had to console themselves with a few\r\njests or a little grumbling.  The caterer or chef in charge\r\nof the State dinners took compassion on the infirmity of our\r\nnature so far as to invent for one of the courses which came\r\nabout midway of the State dinner, a box made of the frozen\r\nskin of an orange.  When it was opened you found instead of\r\nthe orange a punch or sherbet into which as much rum was crowded\r\nas it could contain without being altogether liquid.  This\r\nwas known as the life-saving station.\r\n\r\nSomebody who met Mr. Evarts just after he had been at a dinner\r\nat the White House asked him how it went off.  \"Excellently,\"\r\nwas the reply, \"the water flowed like champagne.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nCABINET OF PRESIDENT HAYES\r\n\r\nThere has hardly been a stronger Cabinet since Washington\r\nthan that of President Hayes.  Its members worked together\r\nin great harmony.  All of them, I believe, were thoroughly\r\ndevoted to the success of the Administration.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State was William M. Evarts.  He was my near\r\nkinsman and intimate friend.  His father died in his early\r\nyouth.  My father was Mr. Evarts's executor, and the son,\r\nafter his mother broke up housekeeping, came to my father's\r\nhouse in his college vacations as to a home.  He studied law\r\nat the Harvard Law School, and with Daniel Lord, a very eminent\r\nlawyer in New York.  One of his early triumphs was his opening\r\nof the celebrated Monroe-Edwards case.  The eminent counsel\r\nto whom the duty had been assigned being prevented from attendance\r\nby some accident, Evarts was unexpectedly called upon to take\r\nhis place.  He opened the case with so much eloquence that\r\nthe audience in the crowded court-room gave him three cheers\r\nwhen he got through.\r\n\r\nHe rose rapidly to a distinguished place in his profession,\r\nand before he died was, I suppose, the foremost advocate\r\nin the world, whether in his country or Europe.  He was counsel\r\nfor President Johnson on his impeachment, counsel for the\r\nRepublican side in support of the title of President Hayes\r\nbefore the Electoral Commission; counsel for the United States\r\nagainst Great Britain before the Tribunal at Geneva.  He was\r\ncounsel in the celebrated Lemon case, where the case was settled\r\nas to the rights of slave owners to bring their slaves into\r\nthe free States, and hold them _in transitu_.  In all these\r\nhe was successful.  He was counsel also in another trial of\r\nalmost equal interest and celebrity, the Tilton divorce suit--\r\nin which Henry Ward Beecher was charged with adultery.  In\r\nthis the jury disagreed.  But the substantial victory was\r\nwith Evarts's client.\r\n\r\nMr. Evarts was a man of unfailing equanimity and good nature,\r\nnever thrown off his balance by any exigency in diplomacy,\r\nin political affairs, or in the trial of causes.  Any person\r\nwho has occasion to follow him in his diplomatic discussions\r\nwill be impressed with the far-sighted wisdom and caution\r\nwith which he took his positions.\r\n\r\nHe was always a delightful orator.  He rose sometimes to a\r\nvery lofty eloquence, as witness especially his argument in\r\ndefence of President Johnson.  He had an unfailing wit.  You\r\ncould never challenge him or provoke him to an encounter without\r\nmaking an abundant and sparkling stream gush forth.  He never\r\ncame off second best in an encounter of wits with any man.\r\nHe was a man of great generosity, full of sympathy, charity,\r\nand kindliness.  If his biography shall ever be properly written,\r\nit will be as delightful as that of Sheridan or Sidney Smith\r\nfor its wit, and will be valuable for the narrative of the\r\ngreat public transactions in which he took a part.  Especially\r\nit will preserve to posterity the portraiture of a great lawyer\r\nand advocate of the time before the days of specialists, when\r\nthe leaders of the American Bar were great lawyers and advocates.\r\n\r\nI do not think Evarts's capacity as a diplomatist is known.\r\nPerhaps it never will be thoroughly understood.  The work\r\nof a Secretary of State in dealing with foreign countries\r\nis performed in the highest confidence and does not ordinary\r\ncome to light until interest in the transaction to which it\r\nrelates has grown cold.  Evarts conducted some very delicate\r\nnegotiations, including that in regard to the Fortune's Bay\r\nmatter, with much skill.  He was careful never, for the sake\r\nof present success, to commit the country to any doctrine\r\nwhich might be inconvenient in the remote future.\r\n\r\nI think Evarts failed to appreciate his own political strength.\r\nHe was in the early part of his life devoted to Mr. Webster,\r\nfor whom he had great reverence, and later to Mr. Seward.\r\nHe sometimes, I think, failed to take wholly serious views\r\nof political conditions, so far as they affected him personally.\r\nI do not think he ever knew the hold he had upon the respect\r\nof the country, or upon the affection of the men with whom\r\nhe was brought into intimate association in public life, and\r\nat the Bar.  He was very fond of his friends, classmates and\r\nkindred, and of his college.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the Republican Party in 1884 he was chosen\r\nSenator from the State of New York.  He had been candidate\r\nfor the Senate in 1861, to succeed Mr. Seward.  His competitor\r\nwas Horace Greeley.  Some of Mr. Evarts's friends thought\r\nthat the old supporters of Mr. Seward, and perhaps Mr. Seward\r\nhimself, did not stand by him as the unfailing and powerful\r\nsupport of Seward would have led men to expect.  But when\r\nhe came into public life in 1885, and took his seat as a Senator\r\nfrom the great State of New York, men looked to him to be\r\nthe great leader in restoring the broken ranks of the Republican\r\nParty.  I think it would have been easy to make him the Republican\r\ncandidate, and to elect him to the Presidency in 1888, if\r\nhe had been willing to take that position himself.  But he\r\ndid not in the Senate, or in the counsels of the party, take\r\nor attempt to take the leadership for which he was fitted.\r\n\r\nHe was invited in the spring or early summer of 1885 to address\r\na political club in Boston.  The whole country listened eagerly\r\nto see what counsel the great Senator and the great Constitutional\r\nlawyer, and great orator, had to give to his party associates\r\nand to the people in that momentous time.  But he contented\r\nhimself with making a bright and witty speech.  The club was\r\nknown as the Middlesex Club, though it had its meetings in\r\nBoston.  He gave a humorous description of the feelings of\r\nthe Middlesex man when he went over to Boston, and those of\r\nthe Boston man when he went over to Middlesex; and told one\r\nor two stories of his early days in Boston, where he was born.\r\nThat was all.  I felt as I listened as though a pail of ice-\r\nwater had been poured down my spine.\r\n\r\nBut modesty and disinterestedness are qualities that are\r\nso infrequent among public men that we may well pardon this\r\nbright and delightful genius for that fault.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of his service in the Senate he had a very\r\nserious affliction of the eyes, which rendered it impossible\r\nfor him to use them for reading or study, or to recognize\r\nby sight any but the most familiar human figures.  He bore\r\nthe calamity with unfailing cheerfulness.  I believe it was\r\ncaused by overwork in the preparation of a case.  The first\r\nI knew of it, he asked me to meet him at Concord, where he\r\nwas about to make a visit.  He told me what had happened,\r\nand that his physicians in Washington and New York thought\r\nthere was a possibility that they congestion of the veins\r\nsurrounding the optic nerve might be absorbed.  But they thought\r\nthe case very doubtful, and advised him to go to Europe for\r\nthe benefit of the journey, and for the possible advantage\r\nof advice there.  He wanted me to undertake the duties devolving\r\non him in the Committee of which he was Chairman, and to attend\r\nto some other public matters in his absence.  His physician\r\nin Paris told him there was not the slightest hope.  He thought\r\nthat the darkness would certainly, though gradually, shut\r\ndown upon him.  He received this sentence with composure.\r\nBut he said that he had long wished to see Raphael's famous\r\nVirgin at Dresden, and that he would go to Dresden to see\r\nit before the night set in.  This he did.  So the faces of\r\nthe beautiful Virgin and the awful children were, I have no\r\ndoubt, a great consolation to him in his darkened hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman was Secretary of the Treasury.  I sat next to\r\nhim in the Senate for several years.  I came to know him quite\r\nintimately.  I suppose few men knew him more intimately, although\r\nI fancy he did not give his inmost confidence to anybody,\r\nunless to his brother the General, or to a few persons of\r\nhis own family or household.  I paid the following tribute\r\nto him the day after his death:\r\n\r\n\"It is rarely more than once or twice in a generation that\r\na great figure passes from the earth who seems the very embodiment\r\nof the character and temper of his time.  Such men are not\r\nalways those who have held the highest places or been famous\r\nfor great genius or even enjoyed great popularity.  They rather\r\nare men who represent the limitations as well as the accomplishments\r\nof the people around them.  They know what the people will\r\nbear.  They utter the best thought which their countrymen\r\nin their time are able to reach.  They are by no means mere\r\nthermometers.  They do not rise and fall with the temperature\r\nabout them.  But they are powerful and prevailing forces,\r\nwith a sound judgment and practical common sense that understands\r\njust how high the people can be lifted, and where the man\r\nwho is looking not chiefly at the future but largely to see\r\nwhat is the best thing that can be done in the present should\r\ndesist from unavailing effort.  Such a man was John Sherman,\r\nfor whom the open grave is now waiting at Mansfield.  For\r\nnearly fifty years he has been a conspicuous figure and a\r\ngreat leader in the party which has controlled the Government.\r\nOf course, in a republic it can be claimed for no man that\r\nhe controlled the course of history.  And also, of course,\r\nit is not possible while the events are fresh to assign to\r\nany one man accurately his due share in the credit for what\r\nis done, especially in legislative bodies, where matters\r\nare settled in secret council often before the debate begins\r\nand almost always before the vote is taken.\r\n\r\n\"But there are some things we can say of Mr. Sherman without\r\nfear of challenge now and without fear of any record that\r\nmay hereafter leap to light.\r\n\r\n\"He filled always the highest places.  He sat at the seat\r\nof power.  His countrymen always listened for his voice and\r\nfrequently listened for his voice more eagerly than for that\r\nof any other man.  He became a Republican leader almost immediately\r\nafter he took his seat in the House of Representatives in\r\n1855.  He was candidate for Speaker before the war, at the\r\ntime when the Republican Party achieved its first distinct\r\nand unequivocal national success, unless we except the election\r\nof General Banks, who had himself been elected partly by Know-\r\nNothing votes.  Mr. Sherman failed of an election.  But the\r\ncontest left him the single preeminent figure in the House\r\nof Representatives--a preeminence which he maintained in his\r\nlong service in the Senate, in the Treasury, and down to within\r\na few years of his death.\r\n\r\n\"He was a man of inflexible honesty, inflexible courage,\r\ninflexible love of country.  He was never a man of great\r\neloquence, or greatly marked by that indefinable quality\r\ncalled genius.  But in him sound judgment and common sense,\r\nbetter than genius, better than eloquence, always prevailed,\r\nand sometimes seemed to rise to sublimity which genius never\r\nattains.  His inflexible courage and his clear vision manifested\r\nthemselves in the very darkest period of our history, when\r\nhope seemed at times to have gone out in every other heart.\r\nThere is a letter in his Memoirs, written April 12, 1861,\r\nwhich, as I remember the gloom and blackness of that time,\r\nseems to me one of the sublimest utterances in our history.\r\nThe letter was written to his brother William, afterward the\r\nGeneral, who had been offered a place in the War Department,\r\nwhich Mr. Chase urged him to accept, saying that he would\r\nbe virtually Secretary of War.  The offer must have been a\r\ndazzling temptation to the young soldier who had left his\r\nprofession and was engaged in civil duties as an instructor,\r\nI think, in a college somewhere.  But John earnestly dissuades\r\nhis brother from accepting it, urges him to take a position\r\nin the field, and foretells his great military success.  He\r\nthen adds the following prediction as to the future of the\r\ncountry.  It was written at midnight at the darkest single\r\nhour of our history:\r\n\r\n\"'Let me now record a prediction.  Whatever you may think\r\nof the signs of the times, the Government will rise from the\r\nstrife greater, stronger and more prosperous than ever.  It\r\nwill display every energy and military power.  The men who\r\nhave confidence in it, and do their full duty by it, may reap\r\nwhatever there is of honor and profit in public life, while\r\nthose who look on merely as spectators in the storm will fail\r\nto discharge the highest duty of a citizen, and suffer accordingly\r\nin public estimation.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman's great fame and the title to his countrymen's\r\nremembrance which will most distinguish him from other men\r\nof his time, will rest upon his service as a financier.  He\r\nbowed a little to the popular storm in the time of fiat money.\r\nPerhaps if he had not bowed a little he would have been uprooted,\r\nand the party which would have paid our national debt in fiat\r\nmoney would have succeeded.  But ever since that time he has\r\nbeen an oak and not a willow.  The resumption of specie payments\r\nand the establishment of the gold standard, the two great\r\nfinancial achievements of our time, are largely due to his\r\npowerful, persistent and most effective advocacy.\r\n\r\n\"It is a little singular that two great measures that are\r\ncalled by his name are measures, one of which he disapproved,\r\nand with the other of which he had nothing to do.  I mean\r\nthe bill for the purchase of silver, known as the Sherman\r\nLaw, and the bill in regard to trusts, known as the Sherman\r\nAnti-Trust Law.  The former was adopted against his protest,\r\nby a committee of conference, although he gave it a reluctant\r\nand disgusted support at the end.  It was, in my judgment,\r\nnecessary to save the credit of the country at the time, and\r\na great improvement on the law it supplanted.\r\n\r\n\"The other, known as the Sherman Anti-Trust Bill, I suppose\r\nhe introduced by request.  I doubt very much whether he read\r\nit.  If he did, I do not think he ever understood it.  It\r\nwas totally reconstructed in the Judiciary Committee.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman was delightful company.  He had a fund of pleasant\r\nanecdote always coming up fresh and full of interest from\r\nthe stores of long experience.\r\n\r\nHe was wise, brave, strong, patriotic, honest, faithful,\r\nsimple-hearted, sincere.  He had little fondness for trifling\r\nand little sense of humor.  Many good stories are told of\r\nhis serious expostulation with persons who had made some\r\njesting statement in his hearing which he received with immense\r\ngravity.  I am ashamed to confess that I used to play upon\r\nthis trait of his after a fashion which I think annoyed him\r\na little, and which he must have regarded as exceedingly frivolous.\r\n\r\nHe used occasionally to ask me to go to ride with him.  One\r\nhot summer afternoon Mr. Sherman said:  \"Let us go over and\r\nsee the new electric railroad,\" to which I agreed.  That was\r\nthen a great curiosity.  It was perhaps the first street railroad,\r\ncertainly the first one in Washington which had electricity\r\nfor motive power.  Mr. Sherman told his driver to be careful.\r\nHe said the horses were very much terrified by the electric\r\ncars.  I said:  \"I suppose they are like the labor reformers.\r\nThey see contrivances for doing without their labor, and they\r\nget very angry and manifest displeasure.\" Mr. Sherman pondered\r\nfor a moment or two, and then said with great seriousness:\r\n\"Mr. Hoar, the horse is a very intelligent animal, but it\r\nreally does not seem to me that he can reason as far as that.\"\r\nI told the General of it afterward, who was full of fun, and\r\nasked him if he really believed his brother thought I made\r\nthe remark seriously; to which he replied that he had no doubt\r\nof it; that John never had the slightest conception of a jest.\r\n\r\nAt another time, one very hot summer day, Mr. Sherman said:\r\n\"Hoar, I think I shall go take a ride; I am rather tired.\r\nWhen a vote comes up, will you announce that I am paired with\r\nmy colleague?\"  I called out to Senator Rollins of New Hampshire,\r\nwho sat a little way off, and who kept the record of pairs\r\nfor the Republican side: \"Rollins, there will be no vote this\r\nafternoon, except one on a funeral resolution in honor of\r\nMr. Allen of Missouri.  Will you kindly announce that Mr.\r\nSherman is paired with his colleague?\" Mr. Sherman got up\r\nin great haste and went over to Mr. Rollins, and said: \"Mr.\r\nRollins, Mr. Hoar entirely misunderstood me.  I never should\r\nthink of announcing a pair on a funeral resolution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman was not an eloquent man, except on some few occasions,\r\nwhen his simple statement without ornament or passion rose\r\nto the highest eloquence by reason of the impressiveness of\r\nhis fact or of his reasoning.  His memory failed in his last\r\nyears, and the effect of age on his other faculties became\r\napparent when he undertook to deal with new and complicated\r\nsubjects.  But he was clear to the last when his great subject\r\nof finance was under consideration.  One of the most admirable\r\nexamples of his power, also one of the most admirable examples\r\nof American campaign speaking, is his statement of the financial\r\nissue between the two parties at the beginning of the campaign\r\nof 1896.  It struck the key-note.  The other Republican speakers\r\nonly followed it.\r\n\r\nHe took great satisfaction in his New England ancestry.  He\r\nfrequently spoke with great pleasure of a visit made by him\r\nand the General, some twelve or fifteen years ago, I think,\r\nto Woodbury, Connecticut, where his ancestors dwelt.  He took\r\na special pride in the character of his father, one of the\r\nOhio pioneers, from whom, I judge from his account, both his\r\nillustrious sons derived in large measure their sterling quality.\r\nHe was a far-away kinsman of my own, a relationship of which\r\nit may well be believed I am highly proud, and of which both\r\nGeneral Sherman and Senator Sherman were kind enough frequently\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\nFor me his death ended an intimate friendship of nearly twenty-\r\nfive years, during many of which we sat side by side in the\r\nSenate Chamber and enjoyed much unreserved social intercourse\r\nin long rides and walks.  Among the great characters which\r\nAmerican has given to mankind these two famous brothers, so\r\ndifferent, yet so like in their earnest love of country, their\r\nindependence and courage, their devotion to duty, will ever\r\nhold a high place.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge W. McCrary had been an eminent member of the House\r\nof Representatives, where he had the confidence of both parties.\r\nHe was a protege of Judge Miller, with whom he studied law.\r\nHis chief ambition, however, was for judicial service.  He\r\nwas much disappointed when it was found desirable that he\r\nshould take the Department of War instead of the Department\r\nof Justice to which President Hayes originally intended to\r\ninvite him.  He very gladly accepted the offer of a seat on\r\nthe Bench of the United States Circuit Court.  He filled that\r\noffice with great credit, and it is highly probable would\r\nhave been promoted to the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nbut for his untimely death.\r\n\r\nHe was the originator of the method of solution of the dispute\r\nas to the title to the Presidency in 1876.  It ought to be\r\nsaid, however, that it was done in full consultation with\r\nMr. Blaine.  I was then quite intimate with both of them,\r\nand a member of the Committee in the House who reported the\r\nplan.  On the seventh day of December, 1876, at the beginning\r\nof the winter session, after the election, Mr. McCrary offered\r\nthe following resolution.  It was adopted.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas there are differences of opinion as to the proper\r\nmode of counting the electoral votes for President and Vice-\r\nPresident and as to the manner of determining questions that\r\nmay arise as to the legality and validity of returns made\r\nof such votes by the several States;\r\n\r\n\"And whereas it is of the utmost importance that all differences\r\nof opinion and all doubt and uncertainty upon these questions\r\nshould be removed, to the end that the votes may be counted\r\nand the result declared by a tribunal whose authority none\r\ncan question and whose decision all will accept as final: Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a committee of five members of this House\r\nbe appointed by the Speaker, to act in conjunction with any\r\nsimilar committee that may be appointed by the Senate, to\r\nprepare and report without delay such a measure, either legislative\r\nor constitutional, as may in their judgment be best calculated\r\nto accomplish the desired end, and that said committee have\r\nleave to report at any time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know that a sketch of Richard W. Thompson, or Dick\r\nThompson, as he was familiarly and affectionately called,\r\nproperly finds a place in my autobiography.  I knew him very\r\nslightly.  I dare say I visited the Navy Department in his\r\ntime.  But I have now no recollection of it.  I had a great\r\nrespect for him.  He lived in the lifetime of every President\r\nof the United States, except Washington, and I believe he\r\nsaw every one of them, except Washington, unless it may be\r\nthat he never saw Theodore Roosevelt.  He was a very interesting\r\ncharacter, a man of great common sense, public spirit, with\r\na wonderful memory, and a rare fund of knowledge of the political\r\nhistory of the Northwest.  Indeed he was an embodiment of\r\nthe best quality of the people of the Ohio Territory, although\r\nborn in Virginia.  His great capacity was that of a politician.\r\nHe made excellent stump speeches, managed political conventions\r\nwith great shrewdness, and also with great integrity, and\r\nhad great skill in constructing platforms.  Colonel Thompson\r\nwas a very valuable political adviser.  It has never been\r\nthe custom to select Secretaries of the Navy on account of\r\nany previously acquired knowledge of naval affairs, although\r\nthe two heads of that Department appointed by Presidents McKinley\r\nand Roosevelt have conducted it with wonderful success in\r\na very difficult time.  A day or two after the Inauguration,\r\nJohn Sherman, the new Secretary of the Treasury, gave a very\r\nbrilliant dinner party to the Cabinet, at which I was a guest.\r\nThe table was ornamented by a beautiful man-of-war made out\r\nof flowers.  Just before the guests sat down to dinner a little\r\nadopted daughter of Secretary Sherman's attached a pretty\r\nAmerican flag to one of the masts.  Somebody called attention\r\nto the beauty of the little ornament.  I asked Secretary Thompson\r\nacross the table to which mast of a man-of-war the American\r\nflag should be attached.  Thompson coughed and stammered a\r\nlittle, and said:  \"I think I shall refer that question to\r\nthe Attorney-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid M. Key was appointed Postmaster-General in furtherance\r\nof President Hayes's desire, in the accomplishment of which\r\nhe was eminently successful, to promote harmony between the\r\nsections, and to diminish, so far as possible, the heat of\r\nparty feeling which had blazed so intensely at the time of\r\nhis election.  Mr. Key was a Democrat, and never, I believe,\r\ncertainly not during President Hayes's Administration, abandoned\r\nhis allegiance to the Democratic Party.  He had been a member\r\nof the Senate from Tennessee, and Lieutenant-Colonel in the\r\nConfederate Army.  His appointment was a popular one.  Mr.\r\nKey administered the affairs of the Department very satisfactorily,\r\nin which he was aided very much by his Assistant Postmaster-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Tyner, who had been an eminent member of the\r\nHouse, to whom, I suppose, he left the matter of appointments\r\nto office.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarl Schurz was a very interesting character.  When I entered\r\nthe House he was a member of the Senate from the State of\r\nMissouri.  He was admirably equipped for public service.  Although\r\na native of Germany, he had a most excellent, copious and\r\nclear English style.  No man in either House of Congress equalled\r\nhim in that respect.  He was a clear reasoner, and not lacking\r\non fit occasion in a stirring eloquence.  He had rendered\r\ngreat service to the country.  The value to the Union cause\r\nof the stanch support of the Germans in the Northwest, including\r\nMissouri, whose principal city, St. Louis, contained a large\r\nGerman population, can hardly be over-estimated.  Without\r\nit Missouri would have passed an ordinance of secession, and\r\nthe city would have been held by the Confederates from the\r\nbeginning of the war.  To prevent this the patriotism and\r\ninfluence of Carl Schurz, then very powerful with his German\r\nfellow-citizens, largely contributed.  He also combated with\r\ngreat power the dangerous heresy of fiat money and an irredeemable\r\ncurrency.  He was a stanch advocate of civil service reform,\r\nalthough he left Congress before the legislation which accomplished\r\nthat was adopted.  So he will be entitled to a high place\r\nin the history of the very stormy time in which he has lived,\r\nand to the gratitude of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nBut he seems to me to have erred in underrating the value\r\nof party instrumentalities and of official power in accomplishing\r\nwhat is best for the good of the people.  When his Republican\r\nassociates committed what he thought some grave errors, he\r\nhelped turn Missouri over to the Democrats, who have held\r\nit ever since.  So the political power of the State since\r\nMr. Schurz abandoned the Republican Party because of his personal\r\nobjection to President Grant, has been exerted against everything\r\nMr. Schurz valued--honest elections, sound money, security\r\nto the enfranchised Southern men, and the Constitutional rights\r\nwhich Mr. Schurz helped gain for them.  He has never seemed\r\nto care for organization, still less to be influenced by that\r\nattachment to organization which, while sometimes leading\r\nto great evil, has been the source of inspiration of nearly\r\neverything that has been accomplished for good in this world.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine says of him, with some exaggeration, but with\r\nsome truth, that he has not become rooted and grounded anywhere,\r\nhas never established a home, and is not identified with any\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nSo the influence of Mr. Schurz has only been to contribute\r\nsome powerful arguments to the cause which he espoused and\r\nnever, certainly for a great many years, that of a leader.\r\nMr. Schurz's arguments for the last thirty years would have\r\nbeen as effective if published anonymously, and I dare say\r\nmore effective than they have been when given to the world\r\nunder his name.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine says of him that he has not the power of speaking\r\nextempore; that he requires careful and studious preparation,\r\nand is never ready, off-hand, to shoot on the wing.  I do\r\nnot agree with Mr. Blaine's estimate of Mr. Schurz in that\r\nparticular.  I have heard him make very effective speeches\r\nin the Senate, and elsewhere, that were undoubtedly extemporary.\r\nMr. Blaine says that Mr. Schurz is so deficient in this respect\r\nthat he has been known to use manuscript for an after-dinner\r\nresponse.  But that has been done, not infrequently, by persons\r\nwho have first-rate capacity for extemporary speaking, but\r\nwho desire to say something to a number of persons much greater\r\nthan those who sit around the tables, who are eager to read\r\nwhat they say.  That should be carefully matured both in thought\r\nand phrase, and should convey their meaning with more precision\r\nthan off-hand speaking is likely to attain, and be reported\r\nwith more accuracy than off-hand speaking is likely to get.\r\n\r\nI have never been intimate with Mr. Schurz.  I deeply lamented\r\nhis action in supporting Mr. Cleveland, and contributing what\r\nwas in his power to the defeat of the Republican Party on\r\ntwo occasions--a defeat which brought so much calamity to\r\nthe Republic.  I have thought that in his dislikes and severe\r\njudgment of individuals he lost sight of great principles.\r\nHis independence of his own party led him to support a very\r\nmuch worse party domination, and to help to accomplish measures\r\nand establish principles to which he had been all his life\r\nutterly opposed.  But the services to which I have alluded\r\nshould not be forgotten.  They entitle him to the highest\r\nrespect, and should far outweigh his faults and mistakes.\r\n\r\nMr. Schurz made one very unfortunate mistake quite early in\r\nthe course of his administration of the Interior Department.\r\nHe had formed the opinion, I suppose without much practical\r\nexperience in such matters, that it would be a good plan to\r\nget the civilized Indians of the country into the Indian Territory.\r\nAccordingly he had issued an order for the removal of the\r\nPonca Indians, of Nebraska, to the Indian Territory.  The\r\nPoncas were a small tribe, living on excellent lands, to which\r\nthey were exceedingly attached.  They were a peaceful people.\r\nIt was their boast that no Ponca had ever injured a white\r\nman.  Mr. Schurz had been informed that the Poncas were willing\r\nto go.  But when they heard of the scheme, they strenuously\r\nobjected.  They sold their ponies to enable an agent to go\r\nto Washington to make their protest known.  But Mr. Schurz\r\nwas immovable.  The Nebraska Senators waited upon him, but\r\ntheir expostulations were received with disdain, as the counsel\r\nof politicians who were not entitled to much respect.  The\r\nremoval was effected.  The Indian Territory proved unhealthy\r\nfor them.  A part of the tribe made their escape, took the\r\ncoffins of those who had died with them, and made their way\r\nback to the original home of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe public feeling was deeply aroused.  I happened to be at\r\nhome in Worcester when a meeting was called by clergymen and\r\nother philanthropic gentlemen.  It was addressed by a young\r\nIndian woman, named Bright Eyes, who belonged, I think, to\r\na tribe closely allied to the Poncas.  I attended the meeting,\r\nbut was careful not to commit myself to any distinct opinion\r\nwithout knowing more of the facts.  When I got back to Washington,\r\nPresident Hayes called on my at my room.  It was the only\r\ntime I have ever known a President of the United States to\r\ncall upon a member of either House of Congress on public business,\r\nalthough I believe President Lincoln sometimes did it; and\r\nit may possibly have happened on other occasions.  President\r\nHayes was very much excited.  He seemed at the time to think\r\nthat a great wrong had been done by the Secretary.  He brought\r\nhis fist down upon the table with great emphasis, and said:\r\n\"Mr. Hoar, I will turn Mr. Schurz out, if you say so.\" I said:\r\n\"O no, Mr. President, I hope nothing of that kind will be\r\ndone.  Mr. Schurz is an able man.  He has done his best.  His\r\nmistake, if he has made one, is only that he has adhered obstinately\r\nto a preconceived opinion, and has been unwilling to take\r\nadvice or receive suggestions after he had determined on his\r\ncourse.  It would be a great calamity to have one of your\r\nCabinet discredited by you.\" President Hayes took that view\r\nof it.  Indeed, I believe on further and fuller inquiry, he\r\ncame to the conclusion that it was his duty to sustain the\r\nSecretary, so far as to keep in the Indian Territory the fragment\r\nof the Ponca Tribe who were still there.\r\n\r\nI took no public part in the matter.  My colleague, Mr. Dawes,\r\nwho was a very earnest champion and friend of the Indians,\r\ncommented on the course of the Secretary in the Senate with\r\ngreat severity; and he and the Secretary had an earnest controversy.\r\n\r\nMr. Schurz was a great favorite with our Independents and\r\nMugwumps, many of whom had, like him, left the Republican\r\nParty in 1872, and some of whom had not returned to their\r\nold allegiance.  Mr. Schurz was invited to a public dinner\r\nin Boston, at which President Eliot, Dr. James Freeman Clarke\r\nand several eminent men of their way of thinking, took part.\r\nThey did not discuss the merits of the principal question\r\nmuch, but the burden of their speech was eulogy of Mr. Schurz\r\nas a great and good man, and severe condemnation of the character\r\nof the miserable politicians who were supposed to be his critics\r\nand opponents.  There was a proposition for a call for a public\r\nmeeting on the other side to condemn the Secretary, and stand\r\nby the Indians.  In this call several very able and influential\r\nmen joined, including Governor Long.  I advised very strongly\r\nagainst holding the meeting.  I was quite sure that, on the\r\none hand, neither Mr. Schurz nor the Administration was likely\r\nto treat the Indians cruelly or unjustly again; and on the\r\nother hand I was equally sure of the absolute sincerity and\r\nhumanity of the people who had found fault with his action.\r\nA day or two, however, after the Schurz dinner, a reporter\r\nof a prominent newspaper in Boston asked me for an interview\r\nabout the matter, to which I assented.  He said: \"Have you\r\nseen the speeches of President Eliot and Dr.  Clarke and Mr.\r\nCodman at the Schurz banquet?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He asked me:\r\n\"What do you think of them?\" I said: \"Well, it is very natural\r\nthat these gentlemen should stand by Mr. Schurz, who has\r\nbeen their leader and political associate.  President Eliot's\r\nspeech reminds me of Baillie Nichol Jarvie when he stood\r\nup for his kinsman, Rob Roy, in the Town Council of Glasgow\r\nwhen some of the Baillie's enemies had cast in his teeth\r\nhis kinship with the famous outlaw.  'I tauld them,' said\r\nthe Baillie, 'that barring what Rob had dune again the law,\r\nand that some three or four men had come to their deaths by\r\nhim, he was an honester man than stude on ony of their shanks.'\"\r\nThis ended the incident, so far as I was concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo draw an adequate portraiture of Charles Devens would require\r\nthe noble touch of the old masters of painting or the lofty\r\nstroke of the dramatists of Queen Elizabeth's day.  He filled\r\nmany great places in the public service with so much modesty\r\nand with a gracious charm of manner and behavior which so\r\nattracted and engrossed our admiration that we failed at first\r\nto discern the full strength of the man.  It is not until\r\nafter his death, when we sum up what he has done for purposes\r\nof biography or of eulogy, that we see how important and varied\r\nhas been the work of his life.\r\n\r\nCharles Devens was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, April\r\n4, 1820.  His family connections led him to take early in\r\nlife a deep interest in the military and naval history of\r\nthe country, especially in that of the War of 1812; while\r\nthe place of his birth and the fact that he was the grandson\r\nof Richard Devens gave to him the interest in the opening\r\nof the Revolution which belongs to every son of Middlesex.\r\nHe was a pupil at the Boston Latin School; was graduated\r\nat Harvard in 1838; was admitted to the bar in 1840; practised\r\nlaw in Northfield and afterward in Greenfield; was Senator\r\nfrom Franklin County in 1848 and 1849; was Brigadier-General\r\nof the militia; was appointed United States Marshal by President\r\nTaylor in 1849, holding that office until 1853; removed to\r\nWorcester in 1854; formed a partnership with George F. Hoar\r\nand J. Henry Hill in December, 1856; was City Solicitor in\r\nthe years 1856, 1857 and 1858.  The news of the surrender\r\nof Fort Sumter was received in Worcester Sunday, April 14.\r\nMonday forenoon came the confirmation of the news and President\r\nLincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers.  General Devens was\r\nengaged in the trial of a cause before the Supreme Court,\r\nwhen the news was told him.  He instantly requested another\r\nmember of the Bar to take his place in the trial, went immediately\r\nup street, offered his services to the Government, was unanimously\r\nchosen the same day Major of the Third Battalion of Massachusetts\r\nRifles, commissioned the next day, April 16, departed for\r\nthe seat of war April 20.  The battalion under his command\r\nwas stationed at Fort McHenry.  On the 24th of July following\r\nhe was appointed Colonel of the Fifteenth Massachusetts Regiment.\r\n\r\nGen. Devens was in command of the Fifteenth Regiment at the\r\ndisastrous battle of Ball's Bluff, where he was struck by\r\na musket ball, which was intercepted by a metallic button\r\nwhich saved his life.  His conduct on that day received high\r\nencomium from General McClellan.  He was soon after appointed\r\na Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and assigned to a brigade\r\nin Couch's Division of the Fourth Corps.  His division was\r\nengaged in the battle in front of Fort Magruder on the 5th\r\nof May, 1862.  On the 31st of the same month he was engaged\r\nin the most critical portion of the desperate fight at Fair\r\nOaks, where his command was conspicuous for valor and devotion.\r\nThis was one of the most stubbornly contested fields of the\r\nwar.  Gen. Devens was severely wounded toward the close of\r\nthe day, but with a few other officers he succeeded in reforming\r\nthe repeatedly broken lines and in holding the field until\r\nreinforcements arrived and stayed the tide of Confederate\r\ntriumph.  He returned to his command as soon as his wound\r\nwould permit, and took part in the battle of Fredericksburg\r\nin December, 1862.  In his official report General Newton\r\nsays:  \"My acknowledgments are due to all according to their\r\nopportunities, but especially to Brigadier-General Charles\r\nDevens, who commanded the advance and the rear guard, in the\r\ncrossing and recrossing of the river.\"  In the following\r\nspring General Devens was promoted to the command of a division\r\nof the Eleventh Corps.  He was posted with his division of\r\n4,000 men on the extreme right of the flank of Hooker's army,\r\nwhich was attacked by 26,000 men under the great rebel leader,\r\nStonewall Jackson.  General Devens was wounded by a musket\r\nball in the foot early in the day; but he kept the field,\r\nmaking the most strenuous efforts to hold his men together\r\nand stay the advance of the Confederates until his Corps was\r\nalmost completely enveloped by Jackson's force and, in the\r\nlanguage of General Walker, \"was scattered like the stones\r\nand timbers of a broken dam.\" He recovered from his wound\r\nin time to take part in the campaign of 1864.  His troops\r\nwere engaged on the first of June in the battle of Cold Harbor,\r\nand carried the enemy's entrenched line with severe loss.\r\nOn the third of June, in an attack which General Walker characterizes\r\nas one \"which is never spoke of without awe and bated breath\r\nby any one who participated in it,\" General Devens was carried\r\nalong the line on a stretcher, being so crippled by inflammatory\r\nrheumatism that he could neither mount his horse nor stand\r\nin his place.  This was the last action in which he took an\r\nactive part.  On the third of April, 1865, he led the advance\r\ninto Richmond, where the position of Military Governor was\r\nassigned to him after the surrender.  He afterwards was second\r\nin command to General Sickles, in the Southeastern Department,\r\nand exercised practically all the powers of government for\r\na year or two.  This command was of very great importance\r\nto him as a part of his legal training.  Upon him practically\r\ndevolved the duty of deciding summarily, but without appeal,\r\nall important questions of military law as well as those affecting\r\nthe civil rights of citizens during his administration.\r\n\r\nHe was offered a commission in the regular army, which he\r\ndeclined.  He came back to Worcester in 1866; renewed his\r\npartnership with me for a short time; was appointed Justice\r\nof the Superior Court April, 1867; was appointed Justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 1873; was offered the\r\nappointment of Secretary of War in the Cabinet of President\r\nHayes March 5, 1877; a day or two later was tendered the office\r\nof Attorney-General by the President, which he accepted and\r\nheld until the expiration of President Hayes's Administration.\r\nHe was offered the office of Judge of the Circuit Court of\r\nthe First Circuit at the death of Judge Shepley, which he\r\nvery much desired to accept.  But the President, although\r\nplacing this office at his disposal, was exceedingly unwilling\r\nto lose his service in the Cabinet; and General Devens, with\r\nhis customary self-denial, yielded to the desire of his chief.\r\nHe was again appointed Justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts\r\nin 1881, and held that office until his death.\r\n\r\nHe was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society\r\nOctober 21, 1878.  He was a member of the Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety.  He received the degree of LL.D. from Harvard University\r\nin the year 1877.  He was chosen President of the Harvard\r\nAlumni Association, and again elected President of that Association\r\nin 1886, in order that he might preside at the great celebration\r\nof the 250th anniversary of the foundation of the college,\r\nwhich he did with a dignity and grace which commanded the\r\nadmiration of all persons who were present on that interesting\r\noccasion.  He died January 7, 1891.\r\n\r\nGeneral Devens gained very soon after establishing himself\r\nin Worcester the reputation of one of the foremost advocates\r\nat the bar of Massachusetts.  He was a model of the professional\r\ncharacter, of great courtesy to his opponent, great deference\r\nto the court, fidelity to his client, giving to every case\r\nall the labor which could profitably be spent upon it.  The\r\ncertainty of the absolute fidelity, thoroughness, and skill\r\nwith which his part of the duty of an important trial would\r\nbe performed, made it a delight to try cases as his associate.\r\nHe was especially powerful with juries in cases involving\r\nthe domestic relations, or which had in them anything of the\r\npathos of which the court-house so often furnishes examples.\r\nHe did not care in those days for the preparation or argument\r\nof questions of law, although he possessed legal learning\r\nfully adequate to the exigencies of his profession, and never\r\nneglected any duty.\r\n\r\nHis fine powers continued to grow as he grew older.  I think\r\nhe was unsurpassed in this country in the generation to which\r\nhe belonged in native gifts of oratory.  He had a fine voice,\r\nof great compass and power, a graceful and dignified presence.\r\nHe was familiar with the best English literature.  He had\r\na pure and admirable style, an imagination which was quickened\r\nand excited under the stimulus of extempore speech, and was\r\nhimself moved and stirred by the emotions which are most likely\r\nto move and stir an American audience.  Some of his addresses\r\nto juries in Worcester are now remembered, under whose spell\r\njury and audience were in tears, and where it was somewhat\r\ndifficult even for the bench or the opposing counsel to resist\r\nthe contagion.  He never, however, undertook to prepare and\r\ntrain himself for public speaking, as was done by Mr. Choate\r\nor Mr. Everett, or had the constant and varied practice under\r\nwhich the fine powers of Wendell Phillips came to such perfection.\r\nBut his fame as an orator constantly increased, so that before\r\nhis death no other man in Massachusetts was so much in demand,\r\nespecially on those occasions where the veterans of the war\r\nwere gathered to commemorate its sacrifices and triumphs.\r\n\r\nAmong the most successful examples of his oratoric power is\r\nhis address at Bunker Hill at the Centennial in 1875, where\r\nthe forming the procession and the other exercises occupied\r\nthe day until nearly sundown, and General Devens, the orator\r\nof the day, laid aside his carefully prepared oration and\r\naddressed the audience in a brief speech, wholly unpremeditated,\r\nwhich was the delight of everybody who heard it.*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* \"The oration by Judge Devens was magnificent.  He spoke wholly\r\nwithout notes and his effort was largely extemporaneous.  He\r\nbegan by saying that the lateness of the hour ('twas nearly six\r\no'clock) would prevent his following the train of any previously\r\nprepared effort and he would briefly review the history of the\r\nbattle and its results upon the world's history.  He spoke for\r\nnearly and hour and a quarter, holding his fine audience in rapt\r\nattention by his eloquence, the elegance of his diction and his\r\nsuperb enunciation.  It was, indeed, a wonderful effort, and\r\nwill compare favorably with Webster's great orations in '25 and\r\n'43.\"--From the diary of Henry H. Edes.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nAt New Haven he delivered the address before the Army of the\r\nPotomac in commemoration of General Meade and the battle of\r\nGettysburg, which is a fine specimen of historic narrative\r\nmingled and adorned with stately eloquence.  At the banquet\r\nin the evening of the same day the gentleman who had been\r\nexpected to respond to the toast, \"The private soldier,\" was\r\nunexpectedly called away, and General Devens was asked at\r\na moment's notice and without preparation to take his place.\r\nI heard President Grant--no mean judge--who had himself listened\r\nto so much of the best public speaking in all parts of the\r\ncountry, say that General Devens's response to this toast\r\nwas the finest speech he ever heard in his life.  The eulogy\r\nupon Grant delivered at Worcester, especially the wonderful\r\npassage where he contrasts the greeting which Napoleon might\r\nexpect from his soldiers and companions in arms at a meeting\r\nbeyond the grave with that which Grant might expect from his\r\nbrethren, is also one of the best specimens of eloquence in\r\nmodern times.  Surpassing even these are the few sentences\r\nhe addressed to his regiment after the battle of Ball's Bluff.\r\n\r\nGeneral Devens had a modest estimate of his own best powers.\r\nWhile he was an admirable judge, bringing to the court the\r\nweight of his great experience, his admirable sense, his stainless\r\nintegrity, his prefect impartiality, his great discernment,\r\nhis abundant learning, it has always seemed to me that he\r\nerred after the war in not preferring political life to his\r\nplace upon the bench.  He could easily have been Governor\r\nor Senator, in which places the affection of the people of\r\nMassachusetts would have kept him for a period limited only\r\nby his own desire, and might well have been expected to pass\r\nfrom the Cabinet to an even higher place in the service of\r\nhis country.  But he disliked political strife, and preferred\r\nthose places of service which did not compel him to encounter\r\nbitter antagonism.\r\n\r\nHe filled the place of Attorney-General with a dignity and\r\nan ability which has been rarely if ever surpassed by any\r\nof the illustrious men who have filled that great office.  The\r\njudges of the Supreme Court long after he had left Washington\r\nwere accustomed to speak of the admirable manner in which\r\nhe had discharged his duties.  I once at a dinner heard Mr.\r\nJustice Bradley, who was without a superior, if not without\r\na peer in his day, among jurists on either side of the Atlantic,\r\nspeak enthusiastically of his recollection of General Devens\r\nin the office of Attorney-General.  Judge Bradley kindly acceded\r\nto my request to put in writing what he had said.  His letter\r\nis here inserted:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 20th, 1891.\r\n  HON. GEO. F. HOAR.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir:_  You ask for my estimate of the services and\r\ncharacter of General Devens as Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates.  In general terms I unhesitatingly answer, that he\r\nleft upon my mind the impression of a sterling, noble, generous\r\ncharacter, loyal to duty, strong, able, and courteous in the\r\nfulfillment of it, with such accumulation of legal acquirement\r\nand general culture as to render his counsels highly valuable\r\nin the Cabinet, and his public efforts exceedingly graceful\r\nand effective.  His professional exhibitions in the Supreme\r\nCourt during the four years that he represented the Government,\r\nwere characterized by sound learning, chastely and accurately\r\nexpressed, great breadth of view, the seizing of strong points\r\nand disregard of minute ones, marked deference for the court\r\nand courtesy to his opponents.  He was a model to the younger\r\nmembers of the bar of a courtly and polished advocate.  He\r\nappeared in the court only in cases of special importance;\r\nbut of these there was quite a large number during his term.\r\nAs examples, I may refer to the cases of Young _v._ United\r\nStates (97 U. S. 39), which involved the rights of neutrals\r\nin our Civil War, and particularly the alleged right of a\r\nBritish subject, who had been engaged in running the blockade,\r\nto demand compensation for a large quantity of cotton purchased\r\nin the Confederacy and seized by the military forces of the\r\nUnited States;--Reynolds _v._ United States (98 U. S. 145),\r\nwhich declared the futility of the plea, in cases of bigamy\r\namong the Mormons, of religious belief, claimed under the\r\nfirst amendment of the Constitution; and established the principle\r\nthat pretended religious belief cannot be accepted as a justification\r\nof overt acts made criminal by the law of the land;--The Sinking\r\nFund Cases (99 U. S. 700), which involved the validity of\r\nthe act of Congress known as the Thurman Act, requiring the\r\nPacific Railroad Companies to make annual payments for a\r\nsinking fund to meet the bonds loaned to them by the Government;--\r\nTennessee _v._ Davis (100 U. S. 257), as to the right of a\r\nUnited States officer to be tried in the Federal courts for\r\nkilling a person in self-defence whilst in the discharge of\r\nhis official duties;--The Civil Rights case of Strander _v._\r\nW. Virginia and others (100 U. S. 303-422), in which were\r\nsettled the rights of all classes of citizens, irrespective\r\nof color, to suffrage and to representation in the jury box,\r\nand the right of the Government of the United States to interpose\r\nits power for their protection;--Neal _v._ Delaware (103 U.\r\nS. 370), by which it was decided that the right of suffrage\r\nand (in that case) the consequent right of jury service of\r\npeople of African descent were secured by the 15th Amendment\r\nto the Constitution, notwithstanding unrepealed state laws\r\nor constitutions to the contrary.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases and many others the arguments of the Attorney-\r\nGeneral were presented with distinguished ability and dignity,\r\nand with his habitual courtesy and amenity of manner; whilst\r\nhis broad and comprehensive views greatly aided the court\r\nin arriving at just conclusions.  In all of them he was successful;\r\nand it may be said that he rarely assumed a position on behalf\r\nof the Government, in any important case, in which he was\r\nnot sustained by the judgment of the court.  His advocacy\r\nwas conscientious and judicial rather than experimental--\r\nas is eminently fitting in the official representative of\r\nthe Government.  It best subserves the ends of justice, the\r\nsuppression of useless litigation, and the prompt administration\r\nof the law.\r\n\r\nI can only add that the members of the Supreme Court parted\r\nwith Attorney-General Devens with regret.  Of him, as of so\r\nmany other eminent lawyers, the reflection is just, that the\r\nhighest efforts of advocacy have no adequate memorial.  Written\r\ncompositions remain; but the noblest displays of human genius\r\nat the bar--often, perhaps, the successful assaults of Freedom\r\nagainst the fortresses of Despotism--are lost to history and\r\nmemory for want of needful recordation.  _Vixere fortes ante\r\nAgamemnona;_ or, as Tacitus says of the eloquent Haterius,\r\n\"Whist the plodding industry of scribblers goes down to posterity,\r\nthe sweet voice and fluent eloquence of Haterius died with\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours.\r\n  JOSEPH P. BRADLEY.\r\n\r\nHe was an admirable historical investigator and narrator.\r\nHe carefully investigated the facts.  He told the story of\r\nthe heroic days of the Revolution and of the heroic days of\r\nthe War for the Union with a graphic power which will give\r\nhis addresses on such subjects a permanent place in our best\r\nhistorical literature.\r\n\r\nBut it is as a soldier that his countrymen will remember\r\nhim, and it is as a soldier that he would wish to be remembered.\r\nWhatever may be said by the philosopher, the moralist, or\r\nthe preacher, the instincts of the greater portion of mankind\r\nwill lead them to award the highest meed of admiration to\r\nthe military character.  Even when the most selfish of human\r\npassions, the love of power or the love of fame, is the stimulant\r\nof the soldier's career, he must at least be ready for the\r\nsupreme sacrifice--the willingness to give his life, if need\r\nbe, for the object he is pursuing.  But when his end is purely\r\nunselfish, when the love of country or the desire to save\r\nher life by giving his own has entire mastery of the soul,\r\nall mankind are agreed to award the good soldier a glory which\r\nit bestows nowhere else.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing lacking in General Devens to the complete\r\nsoldierly character.  He had a passionate love of his country;\r\nhe was absolutely fearless; he never flinched before danger,\r\nsickness, suffering or death.  He was prompt, resolute and\r\ncool in the face of danger.  He had a warm and affectionate\r\nheart.  He loved his comrades, especially the youth who were\r\nunder his command.  He had that gentle and placable nature\r\nwhich so often accompanies great courage.  He was incapable\r\nof a permanent anger.  He was still less capable of revenge\r\nor of willingness to inflict injury or pain.\r\n\r\nAs Clarendon says of Falkland:  \"He had a full appetite of\r\nfame by just and generous actions, so he had an equal contempt\r\nfor it by base and servile expedients.\"  He never for an instant\r\ntolerated that most pernicious and pestilent heresy, that\r\nso long as each side believed itself to be in the right there\r\nwas no difference between the just and the unjust cause.  He\r\nknew that he was contending for the life of his country, for\r\nthe fate of human liberty on this continent.  No other cause\r\nwould have led him to draw his sword; and he cared for no\r\nother earthly reward for his service.\r\n\r\n  Oh just and faithful knight of God,\r\n  Ride on, the prize is near.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nATTEMPT TO REOPEN THE QUESTION OF THE TITLE TO\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\nIn general the determination of the title to the Presidency\r\nwas acquiesced in in a manner highly creditable to the people.\r\nThe Democratic party submitted to their disappointment in\r\na manner which was on the whole exceedingly praiseworthy.\r\nThis was due very largely to the influence of Mr. Lamar,\r\nof Mississippi, and I suppose to that of Mr. Bayard, of Delaware.\r\nBut there were not wanting persons who were willing to revive\r\nthe question for political advantage, whatever the effect\r\nupon the public tranquillity.  On May 13, 1878, when the President\r\nhad been for more than a year in the quiet possession of his\r\noffice, Mr. Clarkson N. Potter, of New York, introduced in\r\nthe House of Representatives a resolution for the appointment\r\nof a Committee to investigate alleged frauds in the States\r\nof Louisiana and Florida, in the recent Presidential election.\r\nThis resolution was adopted by the House, in which every\r\npossible parliamentary method for its defeat was resorted\r\nto by the Republican minority.  The Republicans were exceedingly\r\nalarmed, and the proceeding seemed likely to create a financial\r\npanic which would disturb and injure the business of the country.\r\n\r\nShortly after Mr. Potter's committee was appointed, it was\r\nexpected that a report would be made denying the validity\r\nof President Hayes's title, and that the Democratic House\r\nof Representatives would be advised to refuse to acknowledge\r\nhim as President.  This would have thrown the Government into\r\ngreat confusion and would have made a square issue.  A caucus\r\nof Republican Senators was held, and the following gentlemen\r\nwere appointed a Committee, with directions to report what\r\naction, if any, ought to be taken in the Senate in the matter:\r\nMr. Edmunds, Mr. Howe, Mr. Conkling, Mr. Allison, Mr. Sargent,\r\nMr. Ingalls, Mr. Oglesby, Mr. Jones (of Nevada), Mr. Christiancy,\r\nMr. Blaine, Mr. Hoar.\r\n\r\nI was requested by my associates to prepare an address to\r\nthe people, to be signed by the Republican Senators, arraigning\r\nthe Democratic leaders for their unjustifiable and revolutionary\r\ncourse, and pointing out the public danger.  The Committee\r\nhad a second meeting, when I read to them the following address,\r\nwhich I had prepared and which I still have in my possession:\r\n\r\n\"Our sense of the presence of a great public danger makes\r\nit our duty to address you.  We are satisfied that the leaders\r\nof the Democratic Party meditate an attack on the President's\r\npossession of his office, the results of which must be the\r\ndestruction of the reviving industries of the country, civil\r\nconfusion and war.  There has been difference of opinion whether\r\nthe count of the electoral vote, which under the Constitution\r\ndetermines the President's title, must be made by the two\r\nHouses of Congress, or by the President of the Senate in their\r\npresence.  In the count of electoral votes, which resulted\r\nin the declaration of the election of President Hayes, both\r\nmethods concurred, the action of the two Houses being in accordance\r\nwith a law regulating their proceedings, enacted in the last\r\nCongress to meet the case by large majorities of both branches.\r\nThe title of President Hayes, therefore, not only rests upon\r\nthe strongest possible Constitutional sanction, but the honor\r\nof both the great parties in the country is solemnly pledged\r\nto maintain it.\r\n\r\n\"Yet the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives\r\nhas set on foot a proceeding, which they call an investigation,\r\nintended, if they can get control of the next Congress, to\r\npave the way for the expulsion of President Hayes, and the\r\nseating of Mr. Tilden in his place.  It will be the President's\r\nduty to maintain himself in office, and the duty of all good\r\ncitizens to stand by him.  The result is Civil War.\r\n\r\n\"We know that many Democratic Senators and Representatives\r\ndisclaim in private the purpose we attribute to their leaders,\r\nand denounce the wickedness and folly of an attempt to set\r\naside the accepted result of the last election of President.\r\nYou doubtless know that many of your Democratic neighbors\r\ngive you the same assurance.  Be not lulled by these assurances\r\ninto a false security.  He is little familiar with the history\r\nof that party who does not know how its members follow in\r\ncompact columns where its leaders point the way.  Like assurances\r\npreceded the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.  Like assurances\r\non the part of many Democrats at the South preceded the late\r\nrebellion.  Such convictions on the part of the Democrats,\r\nhowever honest or earnest, of the danger and dishonor of the\r\nproceedings just inaugurated found expression in but a single\r\ndissenting vote in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\"They say that they believe that the result in two of the\r\nStates was accomplished by fraud.  We believe, on the other\r\nhand, that those States, and others whose votes were counted\r\nfor Tilden, were strongly Republican, and would have been\r\ncounted for Hayes without a question, but for violence and\r\ncrime.  The Constitution provides the time, place and manner\r\nin which these contentions must be settled.  They have been\r\nso settled as between Hayes and Tilden, and it is only by\r\nusurpation and revolution that a subsequent Congress can undertake\r\nto reopen them.  You know how easily party majorities persuade\r\nthemselves, or affect to persuade themselves, of the existence\r\nof facts, which it is for their party interest to establish.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of his four years the President lays down his\r\noffice, and his successor is chosen.  The people have in their\r\nhands this frequent, easy and peaceful remedy for all evils\r\nof administration.  The usurpation by Congress of the power\r\nto displace a President whenever they choose to determine\r\nthat the original declaration of the result of an election\r\nwas wrong, on whatever pretence it is defended, is a total\r\noverthrow of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"If you would ward off this blow at the national life, you\r\nhave one perfect means of defence, the election of a Republican\r\nmajority in the next House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had all agreed to it, Mr. Conkling, a member of\r\nthe Committee who had not attended the previous meeting,\r\ncame in late.  The document was read to him.  He opposed the\r\nwhole plan with great earnestness and indignation, spoke with\r\ngreat severity of President Hayes, and said that he hoped\r\nit would be the last time that any man in the United States\r\nwould attempt to steal the Presidency.  Mr. Conkling's influence\r\nin the Senate and in the country was then quite powerful.\r\nIt was thought best not to issue the appeal unless it were\r\nto have the unanimous support of the Republicans.  But the\r\ndiscovery of some cipher dispatches, implicating some well-\r\nknown persons, including one member of Mr. Tilden's household,\r\nin an attempt to bribe the canvassing boards in the South\r\nand to purchase some Republican electors in the South and\r\none in Oregon, tended to make the leading members of that\r\nparty sick of the whole matter.  President Hayes served out\r\nhis term peacefully and handed over the executive power, not\r\nonly to a Republican successor, but to a member of the majority\r\nof the Electoral Commission.  So it seems clear that the bulk\r\nof the American people had little sympathy with the complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE SENATE IN 1877\r\n\r\nWhen I came to the Senate that body was at the very height\r\nof its Constitutional power.  It was, I think, a more powerful\r\nbody than ever before or since.  There were no men in it,\r\nI suppose, who were equal in reputation or personal authority\r\nto either of the great triumvirate--Webster, Clay and Calhoun.\r\nIf we may trust the traditions that have come down from the\r\ntime of the Administrations of Washington and Adams, when\r\nthe Senate sat with closed doors, none of them ever acquired\r\nthe authority wielded by the profound sagacity of Ellsworth.\r\n\r\nBut the National authority itself, of which the Senate was\r\na part, was restricted by the narrow construction which prevailed\r\nbefore the Civil War.  During the Civil War everything was\r\nbowed and bent before the military power.  After the war ended\r\nthe Senate was engaged in a controversy with Andrew Johnson,\r\nduring which there could be no healthy action either of the\r\nexecutive or the legislative branch of the Government.  It\r\nwas like a pair of shears, from which the rivet was gone.\r\n\r\nWith the coming in of Grant harmonious relations were established\r\nbetween the two departments.  But the Senators were unwilling\r\nto part with the prerogatives, which they had helped each\r\nother to assert, and which had been wrenched from the feeble\r\nhand of Johnson.  What was called Senatorial Courtesy required\r\nevery Senator belonging to the party in the majority to support\r\nevery other in demanding the right to dictate and control\r\nthe executive and judicial appointments from their respective\r\nStates.  So every Senator had established a following, like\r\nthat of the Highland chieftain--\"Vich Ian Vohr with his tail\r\non\"--devoted, of course, to the party, but devoted more completely\r\nand immediately to his political fortunes.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant in the beginning undertook to break down this\r\narrogant claim.  He recommended the repeal of the Civil Tenure\r\nAct, the establishment of a system of competitive examinations\r\nfor appointments in the civil service and, under the advice\r\nof Attorney-General Hoar, made the nominations to the new\r\nCircuit Court without regard to Senatorial dictation.  But\r\nhe very soon abandoned this purpose, and formed a close friendship\r\nand alliance with the most earnest opponents of the reform.\r\n\r\nWhile, in my opinion, this claim of the Senators was untenable\r\nand of injurious public consequences, it tended to maintain\r\nand increase the authority of the Senate.  The most eminent\r\nSenators--Sumner, Conkling, Sherman, Edmunds, Carpenter, Frelinghuysen,\r\nSimon Cameron, Anthony, Logan--would have received as a personal\r\naffront a private message from the White House expressing\r\na desire that they should adopt any course in the discharge\r\nof their legislative duties that they did not approve.  If\r\nthey visited the White House, it was to give, not to receive\r\nadvice.  Any little company or coterie who had undertaken\r\nto arrange public policies with the President and to report\r\nto their associates what the President thought would have\r\nrapidly come to grief.  These leaders were men, almost all\r\nof them, of great faults.  They were not free from ambition.\r\nSome of them were quite capable of revenge, and of using\r\nthe powers of the Government to further their ambition or\r\nrevenge.  But they maintained the dignity and the authority\r\nof the Senatorial office.  Each of these stars kept his own\r\norbit and shone in his sphere, within which he tolerated no\r\nintrusion from the President, or from anybody else.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the civil service has doubtless shorn the office\r\nof Senator of a good deal of its power.  I think President\r\nMcKinley, doubtless with the best and purest intentions,\r\ndid still more to curtail the dignity and authority of the\r\noffice.  I dare say the increase in the number of Senators has\r\nhad also much to do with it.  President McKinley, with his\r\ngreat wisdom and tact and his delightful individual quality,\r\nsucceeded in establishing an influence over the members of\r\nthe Senate not, I think, equalled from the beginning of the\r\nGovernment, except possibly by Andrew Jackson.  And while\r\nthe strong will of Jackson subjugated Senators, in many cases,\r\nas it did other men, yet it roused an antagonism not only\r\nin his political opponents, but in many important men of his\r\nown party, which would have overthrown him but for his very\r\ngreat popularity with the common people.  President McKinley\r\nalso made one serious mistake, of which indeed he did not\r\nset the example.  Yet he made what was before but an individual\r\nand extraordinary instance, a practice.  If that practice\r\ncontinue, it will go far, in my judgment, to destroy the independence\r\nand dignity of the Senate.  That is, the appointment of members\r\nof the Senate to distinguished and lucrative places in the\r\npublic service, in which they are to receive and obey the\r\ncommand of the Executive, and then come back to their seats\r\nto carry out as Senators a policy which they have adopted\r\nat the command of another power, without any opportunity of\r\nconsultation with their associates, or of learning their\r\nassociates' opinions.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides, Article I., Sec. 6,\r\n\r\n\"No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for\r\nwhich he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under\r\nthe authority of the United States, which shall have been\r\ncreated, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased,\r\nduring such time; and no person holding any office under the\r\nUnited States shall be a member of either House during his\r\ncontinuance in office.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, I suppose, beyond dispute that the intention of that\r\nprovision was to protect the members of the Legislative branch\r\nof the Government from Executive influence.  The legislator\r\nwas not to be induced to create a civil office, or to increase\r\nits emoluments, at the request of the Executive, in the hope\r\nthat he might be appointed.  He was to preserve his independence\r\nof Executive influence, and to approach all questions in which\r\nhe might have to deal with matters which concerned the Executive\r\npower, or Executive action, absolutely free from any bias.\r\n\r\nThis provision comes, with some modification, from the English\r\nConstitution.  The fear of Executive influence was in that\r\nday constantly before the framers of the Constitution and\r\nthe people who adopted it.  Roger Sherman, in his correspondence\r\nwith John Adams, says that he \"esteems the provision made\r\nfor appointment to office to be a matter of very great importance,\r\non which the liberties and safety of the people depend nearly\r\nas much as on legislation.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" he says, \"a saying of one of the Kings of England\r\nthat while the King could appoint the Bishops and Judges he\r\nmight have what religion and laws he pleased.\"\r\n\r\nI think that sooner or later some emphatic action will be\r\ntaken, probably in the form of a declaratory resolution,\r\nwhich will put an end to this abuse.  But there will always\r\nbe found men in either branch who desire such honorable employment.\r\nThey will be men of great influence.  There are also frequently\r\nmen of personal worth who always support whatever the President\r\nof the United States thinks fit to do, and trot or amble along\r\nin the procession which follows the Executive chariot.  So,\r\nif any President shall hereafter repeat this attempt it will\r\nrequire a good deal of firmness to defeat it.\r\n\r\nSenator Morgan of Alabama made a very bright comparison of\r\nthe relation to the White House of some very worthy Senators\r\nto that of the bird in a cuckoo clock.  He said that whenever\r\nthe clock at the White House strikes the bird issues out of\r\nthe door in the Senate Chamber, and says: \"Cuckoo, Cuckoo,\"\r\nand that when the striking is over, he goes in again and shuts\r\nthe door after him.  He was speaking of Democratic Senators.\r\nBut I am afraid my excellent Republican brethren can furnish\r\nquite as many instances of this servility as their opponents.\r\n\r\nThe President has repeatedly, within the last six years,\r\nappointed members of the Senate and the House to be Commissioners\r\nto negotiate and conclude, as far as can be done by diplomatic\r\nagencies, treaties and other arrangements with foreign Governments,\r\nof the gravest importance.  These include the arrangement\r\nof a standard of value by International agreement; making\r\na Treaty of Peace, at the end of the War with Spain; arranging\r\na Treaty of Commerce between the United States and Great Britain;\r\nmaking a Treaty to settle the Behring Sea controversy; and\r\nnow more lately to establish the boundary line between Canada\r\nand Alaska.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley also appointed a Commission, including\r\nSenators and Representatives, to visit Hawaii, and to report\r\nupon the needs of legislation there.  This last was as clearly\r\nthe proper duty and function of a committee, to be appointed\r\nby one or the other branch of Congress, as anything that could\r\nbe conceived.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised whether these functions were\r\noffices, within the Constitutional sense.  It was stoutly\r\ncontended, and I believe held by nearly all the Republican\r\nSenators at the time when President Cleveland appointed Mr.\r\nBlount to visit Hawaii, and required that the diplomatic\r\naction of our Minister there should be subject to his approval,\r\nthat he was appointing a diplomatic officer, and that he had\r\nno right so to commission Mr. Blount, without the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate.  President McKinley seemed to accept\r\nthis view when he sent in for confirmation the names of two\r\nSenators, who were appointed on the Commission to visit Hawaii.\r\nThe Senate declined to take action upon these nominations.\r\nThe very pertinent question was put by an eminent member of\r\nthe Senate:  If these gentlemen are to be officers, how can\r\nthe President appoint them under the Constitution, the office\r\nbeing created during their term? Or, how can they hold office\r\nand still keep their seats in this body? If, on the other\r\nhand, they are not officers, under what Constitutional provision\r\ndoes the President ask the advice and consent of the Senate\r\nto their appointment?\r\n\r\nBut the suggestion that these gentlemen are not officers,\r\nseems to me the merest cavil.  They exercise an authority,\r\nand are clothed with a dignity equal to that of the highest\r\nand most important diplomatic officer, and far superior to\r\nthat of most of the civil officers of the country.  To say\r\nthat the President cannot appoint a Senator or Representative\r\npostmaster in a country village, where the perquisites do\r\nnot amount to a hundred dollars a year, where perhaps no other\r\nperson can be found to do the duties, because that would put\r\nan improper temptation in the way of the legislator to induce\r\nhim to become the tool of the Executive will, and then permit\r\nthe President to send him abroad; to enable him to maintain\r\nthe distinction and enjoy the pleasure of a season at a foreign\r\ncapital as the representative of the United States, with all\r\nhis expenses paid, and a large compensation added, determined\r\nsolely by the Executive will; and to hold that the framers\r\nof the Constitution would for a moment have tolerated that,\r\nseems to me utterly preposterous.\r\n\r\nBeside, it places the Senator so selected in a position where\r\nhe cannot properly perform his duties as a Senator.  He is\r\nbound to meet his associates at the great National Council\r\nBoard as an equal, to hear their reasons as well as to impart\r\nhis own.  How can he discharge that duty, if he had already\r\nnot only formed an opinion, but acted upon the matter under\r\nthe control and direction of another department of the Government?\r\n\r\nThe Senate was exceedingly sensitive about this question\r\nwhen it first arose.  But the gentlemen selected by the Executive\r\nfor these services were, in general, specially competent for\r\nthe duty.  Their associates were naturally quite unwilling\r\nto take any action that should seem to involve a reproof to\r\nthem.  The matter did not, however, pass without remonstrance.\r\nIt was hoped that it would not be repeated.  At the time of\r\nthe appointment of the Silver Commission, I myself called\r\nattention to the matter in the Senate.  Later, as I have said,\r\nthe Senate declined to take action on the Commission appointed\r\nto visit Hawaii.  But there was considerable discussion.  Several\r\nbills and resolutions were introduced, which were intended\r\nto prohibit such appointments in the future.  The matter was\r\nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.  It turned out\r\nthat three members of that Committee had been appointed by\r\nPresident McKinley on the Canadian Committee.  One of them,\r\nhowever, said he had accepted the appointment without due\r\nreflection, and he was quite satisfied that the practice was\r\nwrong.  The Committee disliked exceedingly to make a report\r\nwhich might be construed as a censure of their associates.\r\nSo I was instructed to call upon President McKinley and say\r\nto him in behalf of the Committee, that they hoped the practice\r\nwould not be continued.  That task I discharged.  President\r\nMcKinley said he was aware of the objections; that he had\r\ncome to feel the evil very strongly; and while he did not\r\nsay in terms that he would not make another appointment of\r\nthe kind, he conveyed to me, as I am very sure he intended\r\nto do, the assurance that it would not occur again.  He said,\r\nhowever, that it was not in general understood how few people\r\nthere were in this country, out of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, qualified for important diplomatic service\r\nof that kind, especially when we had to contend with the trained\r\ndiplomatists of Europe, who had studied such subjects all\r\ntheir lives.  He told me some of the difficulties he had encountered\r\nin making selections of Ministers abroad, where important\r\nmatters were to be dealt with, our diplomatic representatives\r\nhaving, as a rule, to be taken from entirely different pursuits\r\nand employments.\r\n\r\nThat Congress in the past has thought it best to extend rather\r\nthan restrict this prohibition is shown by the statute which\r\nforbids, under a severe penalty, members of either House of\r\nCongress from representing the Government as counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nLEADERS OF THE SENATE IN 1877\r\n\r\nAs I just said, there was no man in the Senate when I entered\r\nit who equalled in renown either Webster, Clay or Calhoun,\r\nor wielded in the Senate an influence like that of Oliver\r\nEllsworth.  With at most but two or three exceptions, no one\r\nof them would be counted among the great men of the century\r\nin which he lived, or will be remembered long after his death.\r\nBut the average excellence was high.  It was a company of\r\nvery wise men, fairly representing the best sentiment and\r\naspiration of the Republic.  The angers and influences of\r\nthe Civil War had gradually cooled under the healing influence\r\nof Grant.  The American people was ready to address itself\r\nbravely to the new conditions and new problems, or to old\r\nproblems under new conditions.\r\n\r\nI shall speak briefly here of some of the principal Senators\r\nwho were there when I took my seat on March 4, 1877, or who\r\ncame into the Senate shortly afterward during that Congress.\r\nOthers I have mentioned in other places in this book.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Wheeler, of New York, was Vice-President and President\r\nof the Senate.  On the Republican side were: William B. Allison\r\nof Iowa, Henry B. Anthony and Ambrose E. Burnside of Rhode\r\nIsland, James G. Blaine and Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, Blanche\r\nK. Bruce of Mississippi, Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, Roscoe\r\nConkling of New York, John A. Logan of Illinois, Henry L.\r\nDawes of Massachusetts, George F. Edmunds and Justin S. Morrill\r\nof Vermont, Frederick T. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, John J.\r\nIngalls of Kansas, John P. Jones of Nevada, Stanley Matthews\r\nand John Sherman of Ohio, John H. Mitchell of Oregon, Oliver\r\nP. Morton of Indiana, Aaron A. Sargent of California, Henry\r\nM. Teller of Colorado, Bainbridge Wadleigh of New Hampshire\r\nand William Windom of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nOn the Democratic side were:  Thomas F. Bayard and Eli Saulsbury\r\nof Delaware, James B. Beck of Kentucky, Francis M. Cockrell\r\nof Missouri, A. H. Garland of Arkansas, John B. Gordon of\r\nGeorgia, L. Q. C. Lamar of Mississippi, Matt Ransom of North\r\nCarolina, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, William P. Whyte of Maryland,\r\nM. C. Butler of South Carolina, William W. Eaton of Connecticut,\r\nJames B. Eustis of Louisiana, Francis Kernan of New York, J. R.\r\nMcPherson of New Jersey, and Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Anthony was the senior member of the Senate when\r\nI entered it.  When he died he had been a Senator longer than\r\nany other man in the country, except Mr. Benton.  He had\r\ncome to be the depository of its traditions, customs and unwritten\r\nrules.  He was a man of spirit, giving and receiving blows\r\non fit occasions, especially when anybody assailed Rhode Island.\r\nHe had conducted for many years a powerful newspaper which\r\nhad taken part in many conflicts.  But he seemed somehow the\r\nintimate friend of every man in the Senate, on both sides.\r\nEvery one of his colleagues poured out his heart to him.  It\r\nseemed that no eulogy or funeral was complete unless Anthony\r\nhad taken part in it, because he was reckoned the next friend\r\nof the man who was dead.\r\n\r\nHe was fully able to defend himself and his State and any\r\ncause which he espoused.  No man would attack either with\r\nimpunity under circumstances which called on him for reply,\r\nas he showed on some memorable occasions.  But he was of a\r\nmost gracious and sweet nature.  He was a lover and maker\r\nof peace.  When his own political associates put an indignity\r\nupon Charles Sumner, the great leader of emancipation in the\r\nSenate, which had been the scene of his illustrious service,\r\nno man regretted the occurrence more than Mr. Anthony.\r\n\r\n  And straight Patroclus rose,\r\n  The genial comrade, who, amid the strife\r\n  Of kings, and war of angry utterance,\r\n  Held even balance, to his outraged friend\r\n  Heart-true, yet ever strove with kindly words\r\n  To hush the jarring discord, urging peace.\r\n\r\nMr. Anthony was a learned man; learned in the history of the\r\nSenate and in parliamentary law; learned in the history of\r\nhis country and of foreign countries; learned in the resources\r\nof a full, accurate and graceful scholarship.  Since Sumner\r\ndied I suppose no Senator can be compared with him in this\r\nrespect.  Some passages in an almost forgotten political satire\r\nshow that he possessed a vein which, if he had cultivated\r\nit, might have placed him high in the roll of satiric poets.\r\nBut he never launched a shaft that he might inflict a sting.\r\nHis collection of memorial addresses is unsurpassed in its\r\nkind of literature.  He was absolutely simple, modest, courteous\r\nand without pretence.  He was content to do his share in accomplishing\r\npublic results, and leave to others whatever of fame or glory\r\nmight result from having accomplished them.\r\n\r\n  To be, and not to seem, was this man's wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe satire, of which I have just spoken, is almost forgotten.\r\nIt is a poem called \"The Dorriad,\" written at the time of\r\nthe famous Dorr Rebellion.  The notes, as in the case of the\r\n\"Biglow Papers,\" are even funnier than the text.  He gives\r\nan account of the Dorr War in two cantos, after the manner\r\nof Scott's \"Marmion.\"  He describes the chieftain addressing\r\nhis troops on Arcote's Hill, the place where one Arcote, in\r\nformer days, had been hung for sheep-stealing, and buried\r\nat the foot of the gallows.\r\n\r\n  The Governor saw with conscious pride,\r\n  The men who gathered at his side;\r\n  That bloody sword aloft the drew,\r\n  And \"list, my trusty men,\" he cried--\r\n  \"Here do I swear to stand by you,\r\n  As long as flows life's crimson tide;--\r\n  Nor will I ever yield, until\r\n  I leave my bones upon this hill.\"\r\n  His men received the gallant boast\r\n  With shouts that shook the rocks around.\r\n  But hark, a voice? old Arcote's ghost\r\n  Calls out, in anger, from the ground,\r\n  \"If here your bones you mean to lay,\r\n  Then, damn it, I'll take mine away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know that I can give a fair and impartial estimate\r\nof Roscoe Conkling.  I never had any personal difficulty\r\nwith him.  On the other hand, he was good enough to say of\r\na speech which I made in the Presidential campaign of 1872,\r\nthat it was the best speech made in the country that year.\r\nBut I never had much personal intercourse with him, and formed\r\nan exceedingly unfavorable opinion of him.  He was an able\r\nman, though not superior in ability to some of his associates.\r\nI do not think he was the equal in debate of Mr. Blaine,\r\nor of Carl Schurz, or, on financial questions with which the\r\nlatter was familiar, of John Sherman.  But he was undoubtedly\r\na strong man.  His speech nominating Grant at the National\r\nConvention of 1880 was one of very great power.  But he was\r\nunfit to be the leader of a great party, and was sure, if\r\nhe were trusted with power, to bring it to destruction.  He\r\nwas possessed of an inordinate vanity.  He was unrelenting\r\nin his enmities, and at any time was willing to sacrifice\r\nto them his party and the interests of the country.  He used\r\nto get angry with men simply because they voted against him\r\non questions in which he took an interest.  Once he would\r\nnot speak to Justin S. Morrill, one of the wisest and kindliest\r\nof men, for months, because of his anger at one of Morrill's\r\nvotes.  I suppose he defeated the Republican Party in New\r\nYork when General John A. Dix was candidate for Governor.\r\nThat opinion, however, depends chiefly on common rumor.  Governor\r\nBoutwell, in this \"Recollections,\" says that Mr. Conkling\r\ncontributed secretly to the defeat of Mr. Blaine, although\r\nhe had been willing to support Blaine four years before.\r\nHe was one of the men whose counsel wrought grievous injury\r\nto Grant, and persuaded him to permit the foolish attempt\r\nto nominate him for a third term.  The deserved respect which\r\nthe American people had for Grant, and his great influence,\r\nwould not induce them to bring Conkling and the men who were\r\nhis associates again into power.  I can hardly think of a\r\nman of high character in the Republican Party, except Grant,\r\nwho retained Conkling's friendship.  His resignation of the\r\noffice of Senator showed how utterly lacking he was in sound\r\npolitical wisdom, or in lofty political morality.  That a\r\nSenator of the United States should vacate his own office\r\nbecause he could not control Executive patronage was a proceeding\r\nnot likely to be regarded with much respect by the American\r\npeople.  I suppose he expected that he would be returned by\r\nthe New York Legislature, and that the scene of his coming\r\nback would be one of great dramatic effect.\r\n\r\nThe reason of his action was President Garfield's nomination\r\nof Judge Robertson, who had been his own earnest supporter\r\nfor the Presidency, to the office of Collector of the port\r\nof New York.  It happened in this way:  General Garfield's\r\nnomination for the Presidency, of which I have told the story\r\nin another place, was brought about in part by the aid of\r\nsome of the New York delegation, led by Judge Robertson, who\r\nhad broken away from Conkling's leadership.  He was of course\r\nangry.  After Garfield's election, he demanded that no one\r\nof the New York opponents to Grant's nomination should be\r\nappointed to office by the incoming Administration.  Garfield\r\ntold me the whole story during the spring session of 1881.\r\nHe had an interview with Conkling, I think by his own request,\r\nand endeavored to come to some understanding with him which\r\nwould ensure harmony.  He told Conkling that he desired to\r\nmake one conspicuous appointment of a New York man who had\r\nsupported him against President Grant, and that thereafter\r\nappointments should be made of fit men, without regard to the\r\nfactional division of the party in New York, between his\r\nsupporters and those of Grant, and that the Senators would\r\nin all cases be consulted.  Conkling would not listen to the\r\nsuggestion, and declared that he would not consent to the\r\nappointment of Judge Robertson to any important office in this\r\ncountry; that if the President chose to send him abroad, he\r\nwould make no objection.  President Garfield told me that\r\nConkling's behavior in the interview was so insolent that it\r\nwas difficult for him to control himself and keep from ordering\r\nhim out of his presence.  Nothing could be more preposterous\r\nor insolent than the demand of a Senator from any State that\r\na President just elected, who had received the support of\r\nthe people of that State, should ostracize his own supporters.\r\nIt would have been infamous for Garfield to yield to the demand.\r\n\r\nI ought, in saying that there was no man of high integrity\r\nand great ability among the leaders of the Republican Party\r\nwho retained Conkling's friendship, to have excepted Hamilton\r\nFish.  He was a man of great wisdom, who understood well the\r\nimportance to the Republican Party of avoiding a breach with\r\nthe powerful Senator from New York.  But Conkling was jealous\r\nof all the other able men in the Republican Party in his own\r\nState.  He could--\r\n\r\n  Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of good and evil politics have striven with one\r\nanother in New York from the beginning of her history as\r\nJacob and Esau strove together in the womb.  In general the\r\nformer has prevailed in western New York and along the lakes.\r\nIn the city of New York sometimes one has carried the day,\r\nand sometimes the other.  When the bad element was in power,\r\nthe noble State has reminded me of Tennyson's eagle caught\r\nby the talons in carrion, unable to fly or soar.\r\n\r\nOliver Wolcott, who had been one of Washington's Cabinet,\r\nafterward Governor of Connecticut, dwelt in New York for some\r\ntime.  He gives this account of New York politics.\r\n\r\n\"After living a dozen years in that State, I don't pretend\r\nto comprehend their politics.  It is a labyrinth of wheels\r\nwithin wheels, and it is understood only by the managers.\r\nWhy, these leaders of the opposite parties, who--in the papers\r\nand before the world--seem ready to tear each other's eyes\r\nout, will meet some rainy night in a dark entry, and agree,\r\nwhichever way the election goes, they will share the spoils\r\ntogether!\"\r\n\r\nJohn G. Palfrey, in his wonderful \"Papers on the Slave Power,\"\r\nwas led by his natural impatience with the conduct of the\r\ngreat State, which seemed to him such an obstacle in the path\r\nof Liberty, to utter the following invective:\r\n\r\n\"Pour soulless giant, her honorable history is yet to begin.\r\nFrom her colonial times, when, patching up a dastardly truce,\r\nshe helped the French and Indians down from the Berkshire\r\nhills against the shield which brave Massachusetts held over\r\nthe New England settlements, through the time of her traitors\r\nof the Revolutionary age, down to the time of her Butlers\r\nand her Marcys, her Van Burens and Hoyts, poltroonery and\r\ncorruption have with her ruled the hour.  Nature has her freaks,\r\nand in one of them she gave a great man, John Jay, to New\r\nYork.  Hamilton was a waif from the West Indies on her spirit-\r\nbarren strand, and Rufus King from Massachusetts.  No doubt,\r\namong her millions, she has many wise and good, but the day\r\nwhen they begin to impress any fit influence of theirs upon\r\nher counsels, will open a new chapter in the annals of New\r\nYork.\"\r\n\r\nI am tempted to quote this powerful invective for its literary\r\nexcellence, and not for its justice.  The history of New\r\nYork, on the whole, has been a noble history.  It must be\r\nconsidered that any people that opens its hospitable door of\r\nwelcome to all mankind, with the elective franchise, must\r\nitself, for a time, seem to suffer in the process, and must be\r\nstrongly tempted to protect itself against evil government\r\nby getting control of the powers of Government by unjustifiable\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nFor many years a large majority of the people of the city\r\nof New York were of foreign birth or parentage.  But how\r\nwonderfully most of these have grown in the elements of good\r\ncitizenship, and of honorable manhood; and how wonderfully\r\ntheir sisters and daughters have grown in the elements of\r\nwomanhood.  Freedom is the best schoolteacher.\r\n\r\nSometimes a political leader in New York who had got power\r\nby forbidden ways, has used it for the good of the Republic.\r\nI suppose the worst examples of all low political leadership\r\nwere the Pelhams, the Duke of Newcastle and his brother; yet\r\nwithout them, Lord Chatham's glorious career would have been\r\nunknown to the history of English liberty.  Chatham used to\r\nsay:  \"The Duke of Newcastle lends me his majority to carry\r\non the Government.\"\r\n\r\nLet me not be understood as meaning to compare Roscoe Conkling\r\nwith such characters.  He was fearless.  He was a powerful\r\ndebater.  He never flinched in debate from the face of any\r\nantagonist.  There was something almost sublime in his lofty\r\ndisdain.  He was on the side of the country in her hour of\r\nperil.  I like Charles Sumner and John Jay and John Adams\r\nbetter.  Neither of these men could have lived long on terms\r\nof friendship with Conkling.  I do not think George Washington\r\ncould have endured him.  But let what was best in him, after\r\nall, be remembered, even if we do not forget his great faults.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ought not, in speaking of the eminent Senators whom I have\r\nknown, to omit Blanche K. Bruce of Mississippi.  Except Mr.\r\nRevels, from the same State, he is the only negro who ever\r\nsat in the Senate of the United States.  He conducted himself\r\nwith great propriety.  He was always courteous and sensible.\r\nHe had a clear understanding of great questions which came\r\nup, and was quite influential with his fellow Senators.  When\r\nthe Chinese matter was up, he stated in a few words that he\r\ncould not, when he recalled the history of his own race, consent\r\nto vote for any measure which discriminated against any man\r\nby reason of his race or color.  He left the Senate Chamber,\r\nI believe, with the entire respect of his associates on both\r\nsides.  He was afterward Register of the Treasury.  His speech\r\nand vote on the Chinese question were in contrast with those\r\nof Senator Jonas, of the neighboring State of Louisiana.  In\r\nmy speech in opposition to the Chinese bill, or that on the\r\nChinese Treaty, I alluded at some length to the treatment\r\nof the Jews in the dark ages and down to a very recent time.\r\nSenator Jonas, who was a Jew, paid me some compliments about\r\nmy speech.  I said:  \"Why will you not remember the terrible\r\nhistory of the men of your own race and blood, and help me\r\nresist a like savage treatment of another race?\" Mr. Jonas\r\nrejected the suggestion with a great emphasis, and said: \"Mr.\r\nHoar, the Jews are a superior race.  They are not to be classed\r\nwith the Chinese.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several negro Representatives from the South when\r\nI was in the House of Representatives.  All of them behaved\r\nwith great propriety.  They were men who took care of themselves\r\nand the interests of their people in any debate.  Mr. Rainey,\r\nof South Carolina, had a spirited tilt with S. S. Cox, one\r\nof the most brilliant of the Democratic leaders, in which\r\nhe left Cox unhorsed and on his back in the arena.  None of\r\nthem ever said an indiscreet thing, no one of them ever lost\r\nhis temper or gave any opportunity for an angry or intolerant\r\nor contemptuous reply.\r\n\r\nSoon after Alexander Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy,\r\ncame to the House, in the Congress of 1875-7, unanimous consent\r\nwas asked that he might address the House at length, without\r\nbeing limited by the hour rule.  Judge Hoar, then a member\r\nof the House, stipulated that Mr. Elliott, of South Carolina,\r\nshould, if he liked, have leave to reply.  This could not\r\ndecently be refused, and that was granted also.  Thereupon\r\nStephens made a powerful speech, for which he had doubtless\r\nmade most careful preparation.  Robert B. Elliott then made,\r\non the instant that Stephens got through, an admirable reply,\r\nof which it is great praise and still not saying too much\r\nthat it deserves to rank with the speech of Mr. Stephens.\r\n\r\nElliott delivered an excellent eulogy on Charles Sumner,\r\nin Boston, which was published with those of Carl Schurz\r\nand George William Curtis, and was entirely worthy of the\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, on the whole, the ablest of the colored men who\r\nserved with me in Congress, although each of the gentlemen\r\nI have named deserves high commendation, was John R. Lynch\r\nof Mississippi.  I had a very pleasant acquaintance with him\r\nwhen he was in the House.  He was afterward Fourth Auditor\r\nof the Treasury.\r\n\r\nI was the means of procuring for him a national distinction\r\nwhich very much gratified the men of his color throughout\r\nthe country.  The supporters of Mr. Blaine in the National\r\nConvention of 1884 had a candidate of their own for temporary\r\npresiding officer.  I think it was Mr. Clayton of Arkansas.\r\nIt was desired to get a Southern man for that purpose.  The\r\nopponents of Mr. Blaine also desired to have a candidate of\r\ntheir own from the South.  The colored Southern men were generally\r\nBlaine men.  I advised them to nominate Lynch, urging that\r\nit would be impossible for the Southern colored people, whatever\r\ntheir preference might be as a candidate for the Presidency,\r\nto vote against one of their own color.  Lynch was nominated\r\nby Henry Cabot Lodge, afterward my colleague in the Senate,\r\nand seconded by Theodore Roosevelt and by George William Curtis.\r\nLynch presided over the Convention during the whole of the\r\nfirst day, and a part of the second.  He made an admirable\r\npresiding officer.\r\n\r\nQuite curiously, I have had something to do with introducing\r\na little more liberal practice in this respect into the policy\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nI was the first person who ever invited a colored man to\r\ntake the Chair in the Senate.  I happened to be put in the\r\nChair one afternoon when Vice-President Wheeler was away.\r\nI spied Mr. Bruce in his seat, and it occurred to me that\r\nit would be a good thing to invite him to take my place, which\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nWhen I was presiding over the National Convention of 1880,\r\none of the English Royal Princes, Prince Leopold, Duke of\r\nAlbany, son of Victoria, visited the Convention.  He was brought\r\nup and introduced to me.  I suppose that was one of the very\r\nrare instances in which a scion of the English Royal House\r\nwas presented to anybody, instead of having the person presented\r\nto him.  Wishing to converse with the Prince, I called Mr.\r\nBruce to the Chair.  I thought it would be an excellent opportunity\r\nto confer an honor upon a worthy colored man in the presence\r\nof a representative of this Royal House.  Frederick Douglass\r\nafterward called on me with a delegation of colored men, and\r\npresented me with a letter signed by prominent colored men\r\nof the country, thanking me for this act.\r\n\r\nIt also was my fortune to secure the selection, on my recommendation,\r\nof the first colored man ever appointed to the Railway Mail\r\nService.  This was soon after I entered the House of Representatives\r\nin 1869.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may as well add in this connection that I believed\r\nI recommended the first married woman ever appointed postmaster\r\nin this country, shortly after I entered the House.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Chenoweth, who had been on General Grant's staff,\r\na most brilliant and able officer of the War, died in office\r\nas Consul at Canton, China, to which he was appointed by President\r\nGrant, I urged very strongly upon Grant the appointment of\r\nthe widow to the place.  She had, during her husband's illness,\r\nperformed a great part of the duties very well, and to the\r\ngreat satisfaction of the merchants doing business there.\r\nI told General Grant the story.  He said he would make the\r\nappointment--to use his own phrase--if Fish would let him.\r\nBut Mr. Fish was inexorable.  He thought it would be a very\r\nundignified proceeding.  He also urged, with great reason,\r\nthat a Consul had to hold court for the trial of some grave\r\noffences, committed often by very bad characters, and that\r\nit was out of the question that a delicate lady should be\r\nexpected to know or to have anything to do with them.  So\r\nthe proposal fell through.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel W. Voorhees of Indiana served in the House with me.\r\nI had with him there one very angry conflict.  But it did\r\nnot interrupt our friendly relations.  He was a man of a good\r\ndeal of eloquence, very popular in his own State, and said\r\nto have been a very successful and able lawyer, especially\r\nin arguing cases to juries.  His political speeches in the\r\nSenate were carefully prepared, very able statements of his\r\nside, and very severe denunciations of his antagonists.  But\r\nhe was a very kind-hearted man indeed, always willing to do\r\na kindness to any of his associates, or to any person in trouble.\r\nIf he could not be relied on to protect the Treasury against\r\nclaims of doubtful validity, when they were urged by persons\r\nin need, or who in any way excited his sympathy, it ought\r\nto be said in defence of him, that he would have been quite\r\nas willing to relieve them to the extent of his power from\r\nhis private resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nBainbridge Wadleigh of New Hampshire succeeded to the Chairmanship\r\nof the Committee on Privileges and Elections after Mr. Morton's\r\ndeath in the summer of 1869.  He was a modest, quiet and unpretending\r\nman, of stainless integrity, of great industry in dealing\r\nwith any matter for which he had direct responsibility, and\r\nof great wisdom and practical sense.  I formed a very pleasant\r\nfriendship with him, and regretted it exceedingly when he\r\nleft the Senate, after serving a single term.  There was at\r\nthe time a very bad practice in New Hampshire of frequently\r\nchanging her Senators.  So few of the very able men who have\r\nrepresented her in the Senate for the last fifty years have\r\nmade the impression upon the public service, or gained the\r\nfame to which their ability would have entitled them, if they\r\nhad had longer service.  Mr. Wadleigh was an excellent lawyer,\r\nand the Senate gave him its confidence in all matters with\r\nwhich his important Committee had to deal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Davis of Illinois was a very interesting character.\r\nHe had been a successful lawyer, an eminent Judge in his\r\nState, and a very admirable Judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, to which office he was appointed by Abraham\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nHe entered the Senate when I did, and served one term of\r\nsix years.  His service in the Senate did not add at all to\r\nhis distinction.  The one thing he had done in life of which\r\nhe was very proud and which was of most importance, was bringing\r\nabout the nomination of Abraham Lincoln at Chicago.  Of that\r\nhe liked to discourse whenever he could get a listener, and\r\nhis discourses were always so entertaining that everybody\r\nlistened who could.\r\n\r\nDavid Davis thought that but for him Lincoln would not have\r\nbeen nominated.  I have little doubt that he was right.  He\r\nhad many able and bright men to help him.  But he was the\r\nleader, director and counsellor of all the forces.  He threw\r\nhimself into it with all the zeal of a man fighting for his\r\nlife.  He made pledges right and left, seeming to discover\r\nevery man's weak point, and used entreaty, flattery and promises\r\nwithout stint, and, if he were himself to be believed, without\r\nmuch scruple.  When somebody said to him in my hearing, \"You\r\nmust have used a good deal of diplomacy, Judge, at that Convention.\"\r\n\"Diplomacy,\" replied Davis, \"My dear man, I lied like the\r\ndevil.\"  He had that sense of humor peculiar to Americans,\r\nwhich likes to state in an exaggerated way things that are\r\ncalculated to shock the listener, which our English and German\r\nbrethren cannot comprehend.  So I do not think this statement\r\nof Davis's is to be taken without many grains of salt. I suppose\r\nhe thought the man to whom he said it would not take it too\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\nJudge Davis was a man of very warm sympathy.  He liked to\r\ngive accounts of cases he had tried, sitting in equity, or\r\nI think sometimes in divorce cases, where he had invented\r\na curious rule of law, or had stretched his discretion, to save\r\nsome poor widow, or wronged wife, or suffering orphan, a\r\nshare of an estate to which their legal title was in considerable\r\ndoubt.  If he were led by his sympathies ever to be an unjust\r\nJudge, at least the poor widow had no need to worry him by\r\nher importunities.  He avenged her speedily the first time.\r\n\r\nHe was a Republican before and during the War, and a steadfast\r\nsupporter of Lincoln's policies.  His opinion had been in\r\ngeneral in support of the liberal construction of the Constitution,\r\nunder which the National powers had been exerted to put down\r\nthe Rebellion.\r\n\r\nHe was elected to the Senate after resigning his place on\r\nthe Supreme Court Bench, by a union of Democrats of the Illinois\r\nLegislature with a few discontented Republicans, defeating\r\nLogan.  When he came to the Senate he preserved his position\r\nas an Independent.  He did not go into the caucuses of either\r\nparty.  He had no sympathy with the more radical element among\r\nthe Democrats.  Yet he liked to be considered a special representative\r\nof the Labor Party in the country.  I think he hoped that\r\nthere might be a union or coalition of the Democrats and Labor\r\nmen in the Presidential election of 1880, and that in that\r\nway he would be elected President.\r\n\r\nHis seat was on the Republican side.  When there was a division,\r\nif he voted with the Republicans, he sat in his seat, or rose\r\nin his seat if there was a rising vote; but when, as not unfrequently\r\nhappened, he voted with the Democrats, he always left his\r\nseat and went over to the Democratic side of the Chamber,\r\nand stood there until his name was called, or his vote counted.\r\nAs he passed Conkling one day in one of these movings, Conkling\r\ncalled out, \"Davis, do you get travel for all these journeys?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate came together in special session, on Monday,\r\nOctober 10, 1881, it was found that the Democrats had a majority\r\nof two.  One Senator only was present from Rhode Island, one\r\nonly from Nevada, and the two newly elected Senators from\r\nNew York had not been admitted to their seats.  A motion of\r\nMr. Edmunds that the oath prescribed by law be administered\r\nto the Senators from New York was laid on the table.  On that\r\nvote the Democrats had a majority of two, Mr. Davis voting\r\nwith the Republicans.  On a resolution that Thomas F. Bayard,\r\na Senator from Delaware, be chosen President pro tempore,\r\nMr. Edmunds moved an amendment by striking it all out and\r\ninserting a resolution that the oath of office be administered\r\nto Mr. Miller and Mr. Lapham of New York, and Mr. Aldrich\r\nof Rhode Island, by Mr. Henry B. Anthony the senior Senator\r\nof the Senate.  That resolution was lost by a vote of thirty-\r\nfour to thirty-three, Mr. Davis voting with the Republicans.\r\nMr. Edmunds then moved to add to the resolution declaring\r\nMr. Bayard President pro tempore, the words \"for this day.\"\r\nThat was lost by one vote, Mr. Davis voting with the Republicans.\r\nAfter several other unsuccessful attempts, Mr. Bayard was\r\nchosen President pro tempore, the resolution being carried\r\nby a majority of two votes, Mr. Davis not voting.  Thereupon\r\nMr. Bayard accepted the office in a speech, brief, but which\r\nclearly implied an expectation on his part to continue in\r\nit for a considerable period of time.\r\n\r\nThe next day, being Tuesday, October 11, Mr. Aldrich of Rhode\r\nIsland, Mr. Lapham and Mr. Miller of New York, were admitted\r\nto their seats.  This left a majority of two for the Republicans,\r\nif Mr. Davis acted with them, and the two parties tied, if\r\nMr. Davis acted with the Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats had succeeded in electing their President pro\r\ntempore, whom the Republicans could not displace, and there\r\nwas left before the body a struggle for the organization\r\nof the Senate, including the executive officers and the Committees,\r\nin which no progress could be made without Mr. Davis's help.\r\n\r\nThat being the condition of things, the Republicans called\r\na caucus, in which Senator Logan, Mr. Davis's colleague,\r\nappeared with a message from Mr. Davis.  This substance of\r\nthe message was that Mr. Davis thought that the Republicans\r\nought to leave the organization, so far as the executive\r\noffices were concerned, in the hands of the Democrats, who\r\nhad elected the existing officers during the previous Congress,\r\nand that the Committees should be appointed with Republican\r\nmajorities.  Mr. Logan further announced that if the Republicans\r\nshould see fit to elect Mr. Davis President pro tempore, he\r\nwould vote in accordance with that understanding.  Mr. Ingalls\r\nof Kansas and I were quite unwilling to accede to this arrangement.\r\nBut at that time the Committees lasted only for the session\r\nfor which they were appointed.  So the Senate could transact\r\nno business of importance, and the office of Secretary, and\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, and Door-keeper, and all the important offices\r\nof the Senate would continue in Democratic hands.  So, very\r\nreluctantly, we yielded to the desire of our associates.\r\nWhereupon a resolution was adopted continuing the standing\r\nCommittees for the session as they had come over from the last\r\nsession, and indeed from the session before, Mr. Davis voting\r\nwith the Republicans.  This vote was passed by a majority\r\nof two votes.  General Logan then introduced the following\r\nresolution:  That David Davis, a Senator from Illinois, is\r\nhereby chosen President pro tempore of the Senate.  This was\r\nalso passed by a majority of two votes, Mr. Davis and Mr.\r\nBayard not voting.  Mr. Bayard descended from the elevation\r\nhe had occupied for so short a time, amid general laughter\r\nin which he good-naturedly joined, and Mr. Davis ascended\r\nthe throne.  He made a brief speech which began with this\r\nsentence:  \"The honor just conferred upon me comes, as the\r\nseat in this body which I now hold did, without the least\r\nexpectation on my part.  If it carried any party obligation,\r\nI should be constrained to decline this high compliment.  I\r\ndo not accept it as a tribute to any personal merit, but rather\r\nas a recognition of the independent position which I have\r\nlong occupied in the politics of the country.\"\r\n\r\nSo, it was Mr. Davis's fortune to hold in his hands the determination\r\nbetween the two parties of the political power of the country,\r\non two very grave occasions.  But for his choice as Senator\r\nfrom Illinois, he would have been on the Electoral Commission.\r\nI do not think, in so important a matter, that he would have\r\nimpaired his great judicial fame by dissenting from the opinion\r\nwhich prevailed.  But if he had, he would have given the Presidency\r\nto Mr. Tilden.  And again, but for the arrangement by which\r\nhe was elected to the Presidency of the Senate, the Republicans\r\nwould not have gained control, so far as it depended on the\r\nCommittees.\r\n\r\nHe did not make a very good presiding officer.  He never\r\ncalled anybody to order.  He was not informed as to parliamentary\r\nlaw, or as to the rules of the Senate.  He had a familiar\r\nand colloquial fashion, if any Senator questioned his ruling,\r\nof saying, \"But, my dear sir\"; or, \"But, pray consider.\" He\r\nwas very irreverently called by somebody, during a rather\r\ndisorderly scene in the Senate, where he lost control of the\r\nreins, the \"Anarch old.\"\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the office of presiding over the Senate is\r\ncommonly not of very great consequence.  It is quite important\r\nthat the President of the Senate should be a pleasant-natured\r\ngentleman, and the gentleman in the Senator will almost always\r\nrespond to the gentleman in the Chair.  Senators do not submit\r\neasily to any vigorous exercise of authority.  Vice-Presidents\r\nWheeler, Morton and Stevenson, and more lately, Mr. Frye,\r\nasserted their authority with as little show of force as if\r\nthey were presiding over a company of guests at their own\r\ntable.  But the order and dignity of the body have been preserved.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis's fame must rest on his long and faithful and able\r\nservice as a wise, conscientious and learned Judge.  In writing\r\nthese recollections, I have dwelt altogether too much on little\r\nfoibles and weaknesses, which seem to have something amusing\r\nin them, and too little, I am afraid, on the greater qualities\r\nof the men with whom I have served.  This is perhaps true\r\nas to David Davis.  But I have said very much what I should\r\nhave said to him, if I had been chatting with him, as I very\r\nfrequently did, in the cloak room of the Senate.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of enormous bulk.  No common arm chair would\r\nhold him.  There is a huge chair, said to have been made for\r\nDixon H. Lewis of Alabama, long before the Civil War, which\r\nwas brought up from the basement of the Capitol for his use.\r\nThe newspaper correspondents used to say that he had to be\r\nsurveyed for a new pair of trousers.\r\n\r\nI was one night in the Chair of the Senate when the session\r\nlasted to near three o'clock in the morning.  It was on the\r\noccasion of the passage of the bill for purchasing silver.\r\nThe night was very dark and stormy and the rain came down\r\nin torrents.  Just before I put the final question I sent\r\na page for my coat and hat, and, as soon as I declared the\r\nSenate adjourned, started for the outer door.  There were\r\nvery few carriages in waiting.  I secured one of them and\r\nthen invited Davis and his secretary and another Senator,\r\nwhen they came along, to get in with me.  When we stopped\r\nto leave Judge Davis at the National Hotel, where he lived,\r\nit was found impossible to get the door of the hack open.\r\nHis great weight pressed it down, so that the door was held\r\ntight as in a vise.  The hackman and the porters pulled on\r\nthe outside, and the passengers pushed and struggled from\r\nwithin; but in vain.  After fifteen or twenty minutes, it\r\noccurred to some one that we within should all squeeze ourselves\r\nover to one side of the carriage, and those outside use their\r\nwhole strength on the opposite door.  This was successful.\r\nWe escaped from our prison.  As Davis marched into the hotel\r\nthe hackman exclaimed, as he stared after him: \"By God, I\r\nshould think you was eight men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEli Saulsbury of Delaware was a very worthy Southern gentleman\r\nof the old school, of great courage, ability and readiness\r\nin debate, absolutely devoted to the doctrines of the Democratic\r\nParty, and possessed of a very high opinion of himself.  I\r\nknew him very intimately.  He was Chairman of the Committee\r\non Privileges and Elections, and was a member of it when I\r\nwas Chairman.  We went to New Orleans together to make what\r\nwas called the Copiah investigation.  We used to be fond of\r\ntalking with each other.  He always had a fund of pleasant\r\nanecdotes of old times in the South.  He liked to set forth\r\nhis own virtues and proclaim the lofty morality of his own\r\nprinciples of conduct, a habit which he may have got from\r\nhis eminent colleague, Senator Bayard, who sometimes announced\r\na familiar moral principle as if it were something the people\r\nwho listened to him were hearing for the first time, and of\r\nwhich he in his youth had been the original discoverer.  I\r\nonce told Saulsbury, when he was discoursing in that way,\r\nthat he must be descended from Adam by some wife he had before\r\nEve, who had nothing to do with the fall.  He was fond of\r\nviolently denouncing the wicked Republicans on the floor of\r\nthe Senate, and in Committee.  But his bark was worse than\r\nhis bite.\r\n\r\nWhen the Kellogg case was investigated by the Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections, when I first entered the Senate,\r\nMr. Saulsbury rose in the first meeting of the Committee\r\nand proceeded to denounce his Republican associates.  He\r\ndeclared they came there with their minds made up on the\r\ncase, a condition of mind which was absolutely unfit for a\r\ngrave judicial office, in the discharge of which all party\r\nconsiderations and preconceived opinions should be banished.\r\nHe said we should have open minds to hear the arguments and\r\nthe evidence to be introduced, as if it were a solemn trial\r\nin a court of justice.  When he was in the midst of a very\r\neloquent and violent philippic, the Chairman of the Committee,\r\nBainbridge Wadleigh, said quietly, \"Brother Saulsbury, haven't\r\nyou made up your mind?\" Mr. Saulsbury stopped a moment, said,\r\n\"Yes, I have made up my mind,\" broke into a roar of laughter,\r\nand sat down.\r\n\r\nHe was a confirmed and incorrigible bachelor.  There was in\r\nNew Orleans, when we were there, a restaurant famous all over\r\nthe country, kept by a very accomplished widow.  The members\r\nof the Committee thought it would be a good thing if we could\r\nhave such a restaurant as that in Washington.  We passed a\r\nunanimous vote requesting Mr. Saulsbury to marry the widow,\r\nand bring her to Washington, as a matter of public duty.  He\r\ntook the plan into consideration, but nothing came of it.\r\nSome mischievous newspaper correspondent circulated a report,\r\nwhich went through the country, that Mr. Saulsbury was very\r\nmuch in love with a lady in Washington, also a charming widow.\r\nIt was said that he visited her every evening; that she had\r\na rare gift of making rum punch; that she always gave him\r\na glass, and that afterward, although he was exceedingly temperate\r\nin such things, he fell on his knees, offered himself to the\r\nwidow, and was refused; and that this ceremony had been repeated\r\nnightly for many years.  I once mentioned this story to him,\r\nand he didn't deny it.  But, on the other hand, he didn't\r\nadmit it.\r\n\r\nWhen he was chosen to the Senate he had two brothers who competed\r\nwith him for the office.  One of them was then Senator.  The\r\nSenate had a good deal of difficulty in getting through its\r\nbusiness before the 4th of March, when the new Administration\r\ncame in, and the term of the elder Mr. Saulsbury ended.  There\r\nhad been an all-night session, so some of the Senators had\r\ngot worn out and overcome by the loss of sleep.  Just before\r\ntwelve o'clock at noon Senator Willard Saulsbury put his head\r\ndown on this desk and fell asleep.  The Senate was called\r\nto order again for the new session, the roll called, and Mr.\r\nSaulsbury's brother Eli had been sworn in.  Willard waked\r\nup, rose, and addressed the Chair.  The presiding officer\r\nquietly replied:  \"The gentleman from Delaware is no longer\r\na member of the Senate.\" Whereupon he quietly withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew C. Butler of South Carolina was another Southern\r\nDemocrat, fiery in temper, impatient of control or opposition,\r\nready to do battle if anybody attacked the South, but carrying\r\nanger as the flint bears fire.  He was zealous for the honor\r\nof the country, and never sacrificed the interest of the country\r\nto party or sectional feeling.  He was quite unpopular with\r\nthe people of the North when he entered the Senate, partly\r\nfrom the fact that some of his kindred had been zealous Southern\r\nchampions before the War, at the time of some very bitter\r\nsectional strifes, and because he was charged with having\r\nbeen the leader and counsellor in some violent and unlawful\r\nconduct toward the colored people after the War.  I have not\r\ninvestigated the matter.  But I believe the responsibility\r\nfor a good deal of what was ascribed to him belonged to another\r\nperson of the same name.  But the Republicans of the Senate\r\ncame to esteem and value Senator Butler very highly.  He deserves\r\ngreat credit, among other things, for his hearty and effective\r\nsupport of the policy of enlarging the Navy, which, when he\r\ncame into public life, was feeble in strength and antiquated\r\nin construction.  With his departure from the Senate, and\r\nthat of his colleague, General Wade Hampton, ended the power\r\nin South Carolina of the old gentry who, in spite of some\r\ngrave faults, had given to that State an honorable and glorious\r\ncareer.  When the Spanish War broke out, General Butler was\r\nprompt to offer his services, although he had lost a leg in\r\nthe Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames B. Beck came into the House of Representatives when\r\nI did, in 1869.  He served there for six years, was out of\r\npublic life for two years, and in 1877 came to the Senate\r\nwhen I did.\r\n\r\nI do not think any two men ever disliked each other more\r\nthan we did for the first few years of our service.  He hated\r\nwith all the energy of his Scotch soul,--the _perfervidum\r\ningenium Scotorum,_--everything I believed.  He thought the\r\nNew England Abolitionists had neither love of liberty nor\r\ncare for the personal or political rights of the negro.  Indeed\r\nhe maintained that the forefathers of the New England abolitionists\r\nwere guilty of bringing slavery into this continent.  He hated\r\nthe modern New England theological heresies with all the zeal\r\nof his Scotch Presbyterian forbears.  He hated the Reconstruction\r\npolicy, which he thought was inspired by a desire to put the\r\nwhite man in the place where the negro had been.  He hated\r\nwith all the energy of a free-trader the protection policy,\r\nwhich he deemed the most unscrupulous robbery on a huge scale.\r\nHe considered the gold standard a sort of power press with\r\nwhich the monopolists of the East were trying to squeeze\r\nthe last drop of blood out of the farmers and workingmen\r\nof the South.  He thought the public debt was held by men\r\nwho had paid very little value for it, and who ought to be\r\npaid off in the same cheap money which was in vogue when\r\nit was originally incurred.  He hated New England culture\r\nand refinement, which he deemed a very poor crop coming from\r\na barren intellectual soil.  He regarded me, I think, as\r\nthe representative, in a humble way, of all these things, and\r\nesteemed me accordingly.\r\n\r\nI was not behindhand with him, although I was not quite so\r\nfrank, probably, in uttering my opinions in public debate.\r\nBut I found out, after a little while, that the Northern men\r\nwho got intimate with him on committees, or in private intercourse,\r\nfound him one of the most delightful companions, fond of poetry,\r\nespecially of Burns, full of marvellous stores of anecdotes,\r\nwithout any jot of personal malice, ready to do a kindness\r\nto any man, and easily touched by any manifestation of kindly\r\nfeeling toward him, or toward his Southern neighbors and constituents.\r\nMy colleague, Mr. Dawes, served with him on some of the great\r\ncommittees of the Senate and in the House, and they established\r\na very close and intimate friendship.  I came to know Mr.\r\nBeck later.  But he had changed his feeling toward me, as\r\nI had toward him, long before either found out what the other\r\nwas thinking about.  So one day--it was the time of Mr. Dawes's\r\nlast reelection to the Senate--he came over to my side of\r\nthe Chamber, took my hand and said with great emotion: \"I\r\ncongratulate you on the reelection of Mr. Dawes.  He is one\r\nof my dearest friends, and one of the best men I ever knew\r\nin my life.\"  And then, as he turned away, he added: \"Mr.\r\nHoar, I have not known you as well.  But I shall the same\r\nthing about you, when your reelection takes place.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a powerful and vigorous frame, and a powerful and vigorous\r\nunderstanding.  It seemed as if neither could ever tire.  He\r\nused to pour out his denunciation of the greed of the capitalists\r\nand monopolists and protectionists, with a fund of statistics\r\nwhich it seemed impossible for the industry of any man to\r\nhave collected, and at a length which it would seem equally\r\nimpossible for mortal man to endure.  He was equally ready\r\non all subjects.  He performed with great fidelity the labor\r\nof a member of the Committee on Appropriations, first in the\r\nHouse, and afterward in the Senate.  I was the author of a\r\nsmall jest, which half amused and half angered him.  Somebody\r\nasked in my hearing how it was possible that Mr. Beck could\r\nmake all those long speeches, in addition to his committee\r\nwork, or get time for the research that was needed, and how\r\nit was ever possible for his mind to get any rest; to which\r\nI answered, that he rested his intellect while he was making\r\nhis speeches.  But this was a sorry jest, with very little\r\nfoundation in fact.  Anybody who undertook to debate with\r\nhim, found him a tough customer.  He knew the Bible--especially\r\nthe Psalms of David--and the poems of Burns, by heart.  When\r\nhe died I think there was no other man left in the Senate,\r\non either side, whose loss would have occasioned a more genuine\r\nand profound sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I came into the Senate one of the most conspicuous characters\r\nin American public life was Oliver P. Morton of Indiana.  He\r\nhad been Governor of Indiana during the War.  There was a\r\nlarge and powerful body of Copperheads among the Democrats\r\nin that State.  They were very different from their brethren\r\nin the East.  They were ugly, defiant and full of a dangerous\r\nactivity.  Few other men could have dealt with them with the\r\nvigor and success of Governor Morton.  The State at its elections\r\nwas divided into two hostile camps.  If they did not resort\r\nto the weapons of war, they were filled with a hatred and\r\nbitterness which does not commonly possess military opponents.\r\nGov. Morton, in spite of the great physical infirmity which\r\ncame upon him before the War ended, held the State in its\r\nplace in the Union with an iron hand.  When he came to the\r\nSenate he found there no more powerful, brave or unyielding\r\ndefender of liberty.  He had little regard for Constitutional\r\nscruples.  I do not think it should be said that he would\r\nwillingly violate his oath to support the Constitution.  But\r\nhe believed that the Constitution should be interpreted in\r\nthe light of the Declaration of Independence, so as to be\r\nthe law of life to a great, powerful and free people.  To this\r\nprinciple of interpretation, all strict or narrow criticism,\r\nfounded on its literal meaning, must yield.\r\n\r\nHis public life was devoted to two supreme objects:\r\n\r\n1.  Preservation of the Constitutional authority of the Government.\r\n\r\n2.  The maintenance by that authority of the political and\r\npersonal rights of all citizens, of all races and classes.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, he interpreted the Constitution in a manner\r\nwhich he thought would best promote these objects.  He had\r\nlittle respect for subtilties or refinements or scruples\r\nthat stood in the way.\r\n\r\nHe was for going straight to his object.  When the Hayes\r\nand Tilden contest was up, he was for having the President\r\nof the United States put Hayes and Wheeler in power by using\r\nall the National forces, military and other, that might be\r\nneedful.  He was a member of the Committee that framed the\r\nbill for the Electoral Commission, but refused to give it\r\nhis support.\r\n\r\nI made a very pleasant acquaintance with him during the sessions\r\nof that Committee.  I suppose it was due to his kindly influence\r\nthat I was put upon the Committee of Privileges and Elections,\r\nof which he was Chairman, when I entered the Senate.  But\r\nhe died in the following summer, so I never had an opportunity\r\nto know him better.  He was a great party leader.  He had\r\nin this respect no superior in his time, save Lincoln alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was never my good fortune to be intimate with Zachariah\r\nChandler.  But I had a good opportunity for observing him\r\nand knowing him well.  I met him in 1854, at the Convention\r\nheld in Buffalo to concert measures for protecting and promoting\r\nFree State immigration to Kansas.  He was the leading spirit\r\nof that Convention, full of wisdom, energy and courage.  He\r\nwas then widely known throughout the country as an enterprising\r\nand successful man of business.  When I went into the House\r\nof Representatives, in 1869, Mr. Chandler was already a veteran\r\nin public life.  He had organized and led the political forces\r\nwhich overthrew Lewis Cass and the old Democratic Party,\r\nnot only in Michigan but in the Northwest.  He had been in\r\nthe Senate twelve years.  Those twelve years had been crowded\r\nwith history.  The close of the Administration of Buchanan,\r\nthe disruption of the Democratic Party at Charleston, the\r\nelection and inauguration of Lincoln, the putting down of\r\nthe Rebellion, the organizing, directing and disbanding of\r\ngreat armies, the great amendments to the Constitution, and\r\nthe contest with Andrew Johnson, had been accomplished.  The\r\nreconstruction of the rebellious States, the payment of the\r\npublic debt, keeping the national faith under great temptation,\r\nreconciliation and the processes of legislation and administration\r\nunder the restraints which belonged to peace, were well under\r\nway.  In all these Chandler bore a large part, and a part\r\nwise, honest, powerful and on the righteous side.  I knew\r\nhim afterward in the Department of the Interior.  He was,\r\nin my judgment, the ablest administrative officer without\r\nan exception who has been in any executive department during\r\nmy public life.  His sturdy honesty, his sound, rapid, almost\r\ninstinctive judgment, his tact, his business sense, his love\r\nof justice were felt in every fibre and branch of the great\r\nInterior Department, then including eight great bureaus each\r\nalmost important enough to be a Department by itself.\r\n\r\nThe humblest clerk who complained of injustice was sure to\r\nbe listened to by the head of that great Department, who,\r\nwith his quick sympathy and sound judgment, would make it\r\ncertain that right would be done.\r\n\r\nChandler has little respect for the refinements of speech\r\nor for literary polish.  He could not endure Mr. Sumner's\r\npiling precedent upon precedent and quotation upon quotation,\r\nand disliked his lofty and somewhat pompous rhetoric.  He\r\nused sometimes to leave his seat and make known his disgust\r\nin the cloak room, or in the rear of the desks, to visitors\r\nwho happened to be in the Senate Chamber.  But he was strong\r\nas a rock, true as steel, fearless and brave, honest and incorruptible.\r\nHe had a vigorous good sense.  He saw through all the foolish\r\nsophistries with which the defenders of fiat money, or debased\r\ncurrency, sought to defend their schemes.  He had no mercy\r\nfor treason or rebellion or secession.  He was a native of\r\nNew Hampshire.  He had the opinions of New England, combined\r\nwith the directness and sincerity and energy of the West.\r\nHe had a very large influence in making the State of Michigan\r\nanother New England.\r\n\r\nHe was a sincere, open-hearted, large-hearted and affectionate\r\nman.  He was the last man in the world of whom it would be\r\nproper to speak as a member of an intrigue or cabal.  His\r\nstrategy was a straightforward, downright blow.  His stroke\r\nwas an Abdiel stroke,\r\n\r\n  This greeting on thy impious crest receive.\r\n\r\nHis eloquence was simple, rugged, direct, strong.  He had\r\nbut a scanty vocabulary.  It contained no word for treason\r\nbut \"treason.\"  He described a lie by a word of three letters.\r\nThe character of his speech was that which Plutarch ascribes\r\nto Demosthenes.  He was strongly stirred by simple and great\r\nemotions--love of country, love of freedom, love of justice,\r\nlove of honesty.  He hated cant and affectation.\r\n\r\nI believe he was fond of some good literature, but he was\r\nvery impatient of Mr. Sumner's load of ornament and quotation.\r\nHe had little respect for fine phrases or for fine sentiment\r\nor the delicacies of a refined literature.  He was rough and\r\nplain-spoken.  I do not think he would ever have learned to\r\ncare much for Tennyson or Browning.  But the Psalms of David\r\nwould have moved him.\r\n\r\nI suppose he was not much of a civil service reformer.  He\r\nexpected to rule Michigan, and while he would have never bought\r\nor bribed an antagonist by giving him an office, he would\r\nhave expected to fill the public offices, so far as he had\r\nhis way, by men who were of his way of thinking.  He was much\r\nshocked and disgusted when Judge Hoar wanted to inquire further\r\nconcerning a man whom he had recommended for the office of\r\nJudge of the Circuit Court.  The Judge said something about\r\nasking Reuben Rice, a friend he highly respected who had lived\r\nlong in Michigan.  Chandler spoke of it afterward and said:\r\n\"When Jake Howard and I recommended a man, the Attorney-\r\nGeneral wanted to ask a little railroad fellow what he thought\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\nHe joined with Conkling and Carpenter and Edmunds in their\r\nopposition to the confirmation of Judge Hoar.  He came to\r\nknow the Judge better afterward and declared that he himself\r\nhad made a mistake.\r\n\r\nHe was a strong pillar of public faith, public liberty, and\r\nof the Union.  He had great faults.  But without the aid\r\nof the men whom he could influence and who honored him, and\r\nto whom his great faults were as great virtues, the Union\r\nnever would have been saved, or slavery abolished, or the\r\nfaith kept.  I hold it one of the chief proofs of the kindness\r\nof divine Providence to the American people in a time of very\r\ngreat peril that their leaders were so different in character.\r\nThey are all dead now--Sumner and Fessenden and Seward and\r\nWilson and Chase and Stanton and Grant and Sherman and Sheridan\r\nand Chandler,--a circle in which Lincoln shines as a diamond\r\nin its setting.  Not one of them could have been spared.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that I should add that I have known very well\r\na good many of the most eminent citizens of Michigan.  This\r\nlist includes Governor and Senator Henry P. Baldwin, and Judge\r\nChristiancy, who displaced Chandler in the Senate.  I have\r\nfrequently heard them speak of Mr. Chandler.  Without an exception\r\nI believe they held him in profound esteem and honor.  They\r\nwere proud of him as the most eminent citizen of their State\r\nwhich has been prolific of strong men, speaking of him as\r\nwe do of Sumner or Webster.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was a remarkable example of what I have often\r\nnoticed, how thoroughly the people come to know the true character\r\nof a public man, even when the press of the whole country\r\nunite to decry him.  I suppose there was not a paper in New\r\nEngland, Republican or Democratic, that spoke kindly of Zach.\r\nChandler for many years.  He was disliked by the Democratic\r\npress for his unyielding Republicanism.  He was disliked by\r\nthe Republican press that supported Charles Sumner, for his\r\nopposition to him.  He was represented as a coarse, ignorant\r\nand unscrupulous man.  In the campaign of 1880 I sent him\r\na telegram, asking him to visit me in Massachusetts and make\r\na few speeches in our campaign.  I added: \"You will be received\r\nwith unbounded respect and honor.\"  The telegram was an astonishment\r\nand revelation to the old man.  He had no idea that the people\r\nof New England had that opinion of him.  Governor Baldwin\r\ntold me that he happened to be passing Chandler's house just\r\nas he received my message.  Chandler knocked on the window\r\nfor the Governor to come in.  He had the telegram in his hand\r\nwhen the Governor entered, and exclaimed: \"Look at that; read\r\nthat; and I did not graduate at Harvard College either.\" His\r\ncolleague, Senator Ferry, alludes to his gratification at the\r\nreceipt of this message, in his obituary delivered in the Senate.\r\nHe spoke in Worcester and Boston and Lowell, and in one or\r\ntwo other places.  His passage through the State was a triumphal\r\nmarch.  He was received as I had predicted.  In Worcester\r\nwe had no hall large enough to hold the crowds that thronged\r\nto see him, and were compelled to have the meeting in the\r\nskating-rink.  Chandler went back to Michigan full of satisfaction\r\nwith his reception.  I think he would have been among the\r\nmost formidable candidates for the Presidency at the next\r\nelection, but for his sudden death.  If he had been nominated,\r\nhe would undoubtedly have been elected.  But, a short time\r\nafter, he was one morning found dead in his bed at Chicago.\r\nIn his death a great and salutary force was subtracted from\r\nthe public life of the country, and especially from the public\r\nlife of the great State to whose history he had contributed\r\nso large and noble a part.\r\n\r\nI have found among some old notes a few sentences with which\r\nI presented him to a mighty audience in my own city:\r\n\r\n\"Worcester is here in person to-night to give a welcome from\r\nthe heart of Massachusetts to the Senator of Michigan.  If\r\nour guest had nothing of his own to recommend him, it would\r\nbe enough to stir the blood of Massachusetts that he represents\r\nthat honored State, another New England in her interests and\r\nin her opinions.  With her vast forests, her people share\r\nwith Maine, our own great frontier State, those vast lumber\r\ninterests, for which it has been our own policy to demand\r\nprotection.  Daughter of three mighty lakes, she takes a large\r\nshare in our vast inland commerce.  Her people are brave,\r\nprosperous and free.  They have iron in their soil, and iron\r\nin their blood.  Great as is her wealth and her material interest,\r\nshe shares with Massachusetts the honor of being among the\r\nforemost of American States in educational conditions.  Massachusetts\r\nis proud to--\r\n\r\n  Claim kindred there, and have the claim allowed.\r\n\r\n\"But our guest brings to us more than a representative title\r\nto our regard.  The memory of some of us goes back to the\r\ntime when, all over the great free Northwest, the people seemed\r\nto have forgotten to what they owed their own prosperity.\r\nThe Northwest had been the gift of Freedom to the Republic\r\non her birthday.  In each of her million homes dwells Liberty,\r\na perpetual guest.  But yet that people in Illinois and Michigan\r\nand Indiana and Ohio seemed for a time to have forgotten their\r\nown history, and to be unworthy of their fair and mighty heritage.\r\nThey had been the trusted and sturdy allies of the slave power\r\nin the great contest for the possession of the vast territory\r\nbetween the Mississippi and the Pacific.  The old leaders,\r\nDouglas in Illinois and Cass in Michigan, who ruled those\r\nStates with an almost despotic power, sought to win the favor\r\nof the South for their aspirations for the Presidency by espousing\r\nthe doctrine of squatter sovereignty, under which the invaders\r\nfrom the slave States hard by, without even becoming residents\r\nin good faith, might fix forever the character of that fair\r\ndomain.  At that time a young knight, a figure of manly courage\r\nand manly strength, came forward to challenge General Cass\r\nto a struggle for the supremacy in Michigan.  It was our guest\r\nof this evening.  As you all know, the young champion vanquished\r\nthe veteran warrior in a trial by battle for the freedom of\r\nthe Continent.  I met him at Buffalo in 1854, in the height\r\nof the conflict, at a gathering of a few gentlemen to concert\r\nmeasures for sustaining, aiding and arming the Free State\r\nimmigrants in Kansas.  He was the leader and the life of\r\nthe company.  Many of those immigrants had gone from Worcester\r\nCounty, where the Emigrants' Aid Society was first devised\r\nby Edward Hale and organized by Eli Thayer.  I met him again\r\nwhen I went to Washington in 1869.  I found him among the\r\nforemost of the leaders of the Senate.  He had gone through\r\nthe great period of the Civil War, and the period before the\r\nCivil War.  He had stood by Lincoln in that time of trouble.\r\nHe had stood firm as a rock for the financial integrity of\r\nthe country.  Afterward it was my good fortune to know a good\r\ndeal of his administration of the great Department of the\r\nInterior.  I have never known, or known of, a better administration\r\nof any Department from the beginning of the Government, than\r\nhis of that great office, with its eight important bureaus.\r\n\r\n\"He brings to you to-night the news from Maine and the news\r\nfrom Ohio.  He can tell you what the Republicans are thinking\r\nof and are doing all over the country, as they prepare themselves\r\nfor the great contest beginning this year, to end, as we hope\r\nand believe, with a great Republican victory in 1880.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn James Ingalls was in many respects one of the brightest\r\nintellects I ever knew.  He was graduated at Williams in 1855.\r\nOne of the few things, I don't know but I might say the only\r\nthing, for which he seemed to have any reverence was the character\r\nof Mark Hopkins.  He was a very conspicuous figure in the\r\ndebates in the Senate.  He had an excellent English style,\r\nalways impressive, often on fit occasions rising to great\r\nstateliness and beauty.  He was for a good while President\r\npro tempore of the Senate, and was the best presiding officer\r\nI have ever known there for conducting ordinary business.\r\nHe maintained in the chair always his stately dignity of bearing\r\nand speech.  The formal phrases with which he declared the\r\naction of the Senate, or stated questions for its decision,\r\nseemed to be a fitting part of some stately ceremonial.  He\r\ndid not care much about the principles of parliamentary law,\r\nand had never been a very thorough student of the rules.  So\r\nhis decisions did not have the same authority as those of\r\nMr. Wheeler or Mr. Edmunds or Mr. Hamlin.\r\n\r\nI said to him one day, \"I think you are the best presiding\r\nofficer I ever knew.  But I do not think you know much about\r\nparliamentary law.\"  To which he replied:  \"I think the sting\r\nis bigger than the bee.\"\r\n\r\nHe never lost an opportunity to indulge his gift of caustic\r\nwit, no matter at whose expense.  When the morning hour was\r\ndevoted to acting upon the reports of committees in cases\r\nof private claims, or pensions, he used to look over, the\r\nnight before, the reports which were likely to be on the next\r\nday's calendar.  When a bill was reached he would get up and\r\nmake a pretty sharp attack on the measure, full of wit and\r\nsatire.  He generally knew very little about it.  When he\r\ngot through his speech he would disappear into the cloak room\r\nand leave the Senator who had reported the bill, and had expected\r\nto get it through without any difficulty--the case being very\r\noften absolutely clear and just--to spend his time in an elaborate\r\nand indignant explanation.\r\n\r\nMr. Ingalls disliked very much the scrupulous administrations\r\nof Hayes and Harrison.  He yielded to the craze for free silver\r\nwhich swept over parts of the West, and in so doing lost the\r\nconfidence of the people to whose momentary impulse he had\r\ngiven way.  If he had stood stanchly on the New England doctrines\r\nand principles in which he was educated, and which I think\r\nhe believed in his heart, he would have kept his State on\r\nthe right side.  Shortly before the campaign in which he was\r\ndefeated for Senator, he said in the cloak room, in my hearing,\r\nthat he did not propose to be a martyr.  He was the author\r\nor a beautiful poem, entitled \"Opportunity,\" which I think\r\nshould accompany this imperfect sketch.\r\n\r\n  OPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n  Master of human destinies am I!\r\n  Fame, love and fortune on my footsteps wait,\r\n  Cities and fields I walk; I penetrate\r\n  Deserts and seas remote, and passing by\r\n  Hovel and mart and palace--soon or late\r\n  I knock unbidden once at every gate!\r\n\r\n  If sleeping, wake--if feasting, rise before\r\n  I turn away.  It is the hour of fate,\r\n  And they who follow me reach every state\r\n  Mortals desire, and conquer every foe\r\n  Save death; but those who doubt or hesitate,\r\n  Condemned to failure, penury and woe,\r\n  Seek me in vain and uselessly implore.\r\n  I answer not, and I return no more!\r\n\r\nIngalls was a native of Haverhill, Massachusetts.  Somewhere\r\nabout 1880, being in Boston, he gave an interview to one of\r\nthe papers in which he commented very severely on the want\r\nof able leadership in the Republican Party in Massachusetts.\r\nI suppose the criticism was directed at me, although he did\r\nnot mention my name.  In 1880 Massachusetts gave a Republican\r\nmajority of 48,697, and Kansas a Republican majority of 41,897.\r\nMr. Ingalls's leadership in Kansas had been manifested very\r\nlargely in the control of official patronage.  He said in\r\nthe Senate that he and his colleague sought to get rid of\r\nall Democrats in office in Kansas as with a fine-toothed comb.\r\n\r\nSo far as I had been concerned, and so far as the Republican\r\nleaders in Massachusetts had been concerned, with the exception\r\nof General Butler, a different policy had been adopted.  We\r\nhad never attempted to make a political instrument of official\r\npatronage.  There had never been anything like a \"boss\" or\r\na machine.  Our State politics had been conducted, and our\r\ncandidates for office nominated, after the old fashion of\r\na New England town meeting.  When an election approached,\r\nor when a great measure or political question was to be decided,\r\nmen who were influential consulted together informally, ascertained\r\nthe public sentiment, deferred to it, if it seemed to be right,\r\nand did what they could to persuade it and guide it by speech\r\nand discussion in the press, if it needed guidance, and trusted,\r\nhardly ever in vain, to the intelligence of the people for\r\nthe result.  I do not know but the diminution of the comparative\r\nimportance of the towns, and the change of the Commonwealth\r\nand cluster of cities and manufacturing villages, and the\r\ninflux of other elements than that of the old New England\r\nstock may not bring about, or if indeed it is not already\r\nbringing about, a different conduct of affairs.  But I have\r\nnever adopted any other method, and I have never desired that\r\nmy public life or influence should survive the introduction\r\nof any other method in Massachusetts.  Mr. Ingalls's methods\r\nand mine have been tested by their results.  The people of\r\nKansas are largely of Massachusetts origin.  I believe if\r\nher leading men had pursued Massachusetts methods she would\r\nto a great extent have repeated Massachusetts history.  Our\r\nmethod of political management and control has been vindicated\r\nby the fact that the Commonwealth has been kept true to its\r\nancient faith, except in a very few years when accidental\r\ncauses have caused the election of a Democratic Governor.\r\nThose elections were protests against an attempt to depart\r\nfrom the old-fashioned method of ascertaining the will of\r\nthe people in selecting Republican candidates.  Massachusetts\r\nhas kept the succession of United States Senators unbroken,\r\nand has had a Republican delegation in the House ever since\r\nthe party came into power, with two exceptions.  She has in\r\ngeneral maintained her great Republican majority.  On the other\r\nhand Kansas has been represented in turn by Democrats and\r\nPopulists and Socialists and the advocates of fiat money and\r\nfree silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Cockrell of Missouri entered the Senate two years\r\nbefore I did, and has been there ever since.  He is a man\r\nof great sincerity and integrity, of great influence with his\r\nown party, and highly esteemed by his Republican associates.\r\nHe can generally be depended upon for a fair vote, certainly\r\nalways for an honest and incorruptible vote, and to do full\r\njustice to a political opponent.  He used for many years to\r\nprepare one speech, in each session, in which he went over\r\nthe political issues of the two parties in a violent and extreme\r\nfashion.  He would give us the whole history of the year and\r\npoint out the imperfections and weakness and atrocity of the\r\nparty in power in a most unsparing fashion.  This speech he\r\nwould frank home to Missouri.  He seemed to think his duty\r\nas a Democratic politician was done, and he would betake himself\r\nto statesmanship the rest of the year.  I think he has of\r\nlate discontinued that practice.  I do not want what I have\r\nsaid to be taken too seriously.  There is scarcely a member\r\nof either side in either House who would be more missed from\r\nthe public service, if anything were to happen to him, than\r\nMr. Cockrell, nor for whom all men have a kindlier and more\r\naffectionate regard.  Like Mr. Allison, he knows the mechanism\r\nof administration and legislation through and through.  He\r\nwould be entirely competent to fill a chair of public administration\r\nin any college, if, as I hope may be done, such chairs shall\r\nbe established.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Justin Morrill died, not only a great figure left the\r\nSenate Chamber--the image of the ancient virtue of New England--\r\nbut an era in our national history came to an end.  He knew\r\nin his youth the veterans of the Revolution and the generation\r\nwho declared independence and framed the Constitution, as\r\nthe young men who are coming to manhood to-day know the veterans\r\nwho won our victories and the statesmen who conducted our\r\npolicy in the Civil War.  He knew the whole history of his\r\ncountry from the time of her independence, partly from the\r\nlips of those who had shaped it, partly because of the large\r\nshare he had in it himself.  When he was born Washington had\r\nbeen dead but ten years.  He was sixteen years old when Jefferson\r\nand Adams died.  He was twenty-two years old when Charles\r\nCarroll died.  He was born at the beginning of the second\r\nyear of Madison's Presidency, and was a man of twenty-six\r\nwhen Madison died.  In his youth and early manhood the manners\r\nof Ethan Allen's time still prevailed in Vermont, and Allen's\r\ncompanions and comrades could be found in every village.\r\nHe was old enough to feel in his boyish soul something of\r\nthe thrill of our great naval victories, and of the victory at\r\nNew Orleans in our last war with England, and, perhaps, to\r\nunderstand something of the significance of the treaty of\r\npeace of 1815.  He knew many of the fathers of the country\r\nas we knew him.  In his lifetime the country grew from seventeen\r\nhundred thousand to thirty-six hundred thousand square miles,\r\nfrom seventeen States to forty-five States, from four million\r\npeople to seventy-five million.  To the America into which\r\nhe was born seventeen new Americas had been added before he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nA great and healthful and beneficent power departed from our\r\ncountry's life.  If he had not lived, the history of the country\r\nwould have been different in some very important particulars;\r\nand it is not unlikely that his death changed the result in\r\nsome matters of great pith and moment, which are to affect\r\nprofoundly the history of the country in the future.  The\r\nlonger I live, the more carefully I study the former times\r\nor observe my own time, the more I am impressed with the sensitiveness\r\nof every people, however great or however free, to an individual\r\ntouch, to the influence of a personal force.  There is no\r\nsuch thing as a blind fate; no such thing as an overwhelming\r\nand pitiless destiny.  The Providence that governs this world\r\nleaves nations as He leaves men, to work out their own destiny,\r\ntheir own fate, in freedom, as they obey or disobey His will.\r\n\r\n  Man is his own star; and the soul that can\r\n  Render an honest and a perfect man\r\n  Commands all life, all influence, all fate;\r\n  Nothing to him falls early or too late.\r\n  Our acts our angels are, or good or ill;\r\n  Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful what things this man accomplished alone,\r\nwhat things he helped others to accomplish, what things were\r\naccomplished by the political organization of which he was\r\na leader, which he bore a very large part in accomplishing.\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill's public life was coincident with the advent\r\nof the Republican Party to National power.  His first important\r\nvote in the House of Representatives helped to elect Mr. Banks\r\nto the office of Speaker, the first National victory of a\r\nparty organized to prevent the extension of slavery.  From\r\nthat moment, for nearly half a century, Vermont spoke through\r\nhim in our National Council, until, one after another, almost\r\nevery great question affecting the public welfare has been\r\ndecided in accordance with her opinion.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, even by a most careful study of the\r\nhistory of the country for the last forty years, to determine\r\nwith exactness what was due to Mr. Morrill's personal influence.\r\nMany of the great policies to which we owe the successful\r\nresult of the Civil War--the abolition of slavery, the restoration\r\nof peace, the new and enlarged definition of citizenship,\r\nthe restoration of order, the establishment of public credit,\r\nthe homestead system, the foundation and admission of new\r\nStates, the exaction of apology and reparation from Great\r\nBritain, the establishment of the doctrine of expatriation,\r\nthe achievement of our manufacturing independence, the taking\r\nby the United States of its place as the foremost nation in\r\nthe world in manufacture and in wealth, as it was already\r\nforemost in agriculture, the creation of our vast domestic\r\ncommerce, the extension of our railroad system from one ocean\r\nto the other--were carried into effect by narrow majorities,\r\nand would have failed but for the wisest counsel.  When all\r\nthese matters were before Congress there may have been men\r\nmore brilliant or more powerful in debate.  But I can not\r\nthink of any wiser in counsel than Mr. Morrill.  Many of\r\nthem must have been lost but for his powerful support.  Many\r\nowed to him the shape they finally took.\r\n\r\nBut he has left many a personal monument in our legislation,\r\nin the glory of which no others can rightfully claim to rival\r\nhim.  To him is due the great tariff, that of 1861, which\r\nwill always pass by his name, of which every protective tariff\r\nsince has been but a modification and adjustment to conditions\r\nsomewhat changed, conditions which in general, so far as they\r\nwere favorable, were the result of that measure.  To him is\r\ndue the first antipolygamy bill, which inaugurated the policy\r\nunder which, as we hope and believe, that great blot on our\r\nNational life has been forever expunged.  The public buildings\r\nwhich ornament Washington, the extension of the Capitol grounds,\r\nthe great building where the State, War and Navy Departments\r\nhave their home, the National Museum buildings, are the result\r\nof statutes of which he was the author and which he conducted\r\nfrom their introduction to their enactment.  He was the leader,\r\nas Mr. Winthrop in his noble oration bears witness, of the\r\naction of Congress which resulted in the completion of the\r\nWashington Monument after so many years' delay.  He conceived\r\nand accomplished the idea of consecrating the beautiful chamber\r\nof the old House of Representatives as a Memorial Hall where\r\nshould stand forever the statues of the great men of the States.\r\nSo far, of late, as the prosperity and wise administration\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution has depended upon the action\r\nof Congress it has been due to him.  Above all, the beautiful\r\nNational Library building, unequalled among buildings of its\r\nclass in the world, was in a large measure the result of his\r\npersistent effort and powerful influence, and stands as an\r\nenduring monument to his fame.  There can be no more beautiful\r\nand enviable memorial to any man than a portrait upon the\r\nwalls of a great college in the gallery where the figures\r\nand faces of its benefactors are collected.  Mr. Morrill\r\ndeserves this expression of honor and gratitude at the hands\r\nof at least one great institution of learning in every American\r\nState.  To his wise foresight is due the ample endowment of\r\nAgricultural or Technical colleges in every State in the Union.\r\n\r\nHe came from a small State, thinly settled--from a frontier\r\nState.  His advantages of education were those only which\r\nthe public schools of the neighborhood afforded.  All his\r\nlife, with a brief interval, was spent in the same town,\r\nnine miles from any railroad, except when absent in the public\r\nservice.  But there was no touch of provincialism in him.\r\nEverything about him was broad, national, American.  His intellect\r\nand soul, his conceptions of statesmanship and of duty expanded\r\nas the country grew and as the demands upon him increased.\r\nHe was in every respect as competent to legislate for fifty\r\nStates as for thirteen.  He would have been as competent to\r\nlegislate for an entire continent so long as that legislation\r\nwere to be governed, restrained, inspired by the principles\r\nin which our Union is founded and the maxims of the men who\r\nbuilded it.\r\n\r\nHe was no dreamer, no idealist, no sentimentalist.  He was\r\npractical, wise, prudent.  In whatever assembly he was found\r\nhe represented the solid sense of the meeting.  But still\r\nhe never departed from the loftiest ideals.  On any question\r\ninvolving righteousness or freedom you would as soon have\r\nhad doubt of George Washington's position as of his.  He had\r\nno duplicity, no indirection, no diplomacy.  He was frank,\r\nplain-spoken, simple-hearted.  He had no faculty for swimming\r\nunder water.\r\n\r\n  His armor was his honest thought\r\n  And simple truth his utmost skill.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle's counsel to his young disciple will serve for\r\na lifelike portraiture of Justin Morrill:\r\n\r\n  \"Be sober-minded:\r\n  \"Speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:\r\n  \"In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works:\r\n  in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity;\r\n  \"Sound speech that can not be condemned; that he that is\r\n  of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing\r\n  to say of you.\"\r\n\r\nIf you wish to sum up the quality of Justin Morrill in a\r\nsingle word, mind, body, and soul, that word would be Health.\r\nHe was thoroughly healthy, through and through, to the center\r\nof his brain, to his heart's core.  Like all healthy souls,\r\nhe was full of good cheer and sunshine, full of hope for the\r\nfuture, full of pleasant memories of the past.  To him life\r\nwas made up of cheerful yesterdays and confident to-morrows.\r\nBut with all his friendliness and kindliness, with all his\r\ngreat hold upon the love and respect of the people, with all\r\nhis large circle of friends, with all his delight in companionship\r\nand agreeable converse, he dared to be alone.  He found good\r\nsociety enough always, if no other were at hand, in himself.\r\nHe was many times called upon to espouse unpopular causes\r\nand unpopular doctrines.  From the time when in his youth\r\nhe devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause, then odious\r\nin the nostrils of his countrymen, to the time when in the\r\nlast days of his life he raised his brave voice against a\r\npolicy upon which the majority of his political associates\r\nseemed bent, he never yielded the conclusions of his own judgment\r\nor the dictates of his own conscience to any majority, to\r\nany party dictation, or to any public clamor.  When Freedom,\r\nRighteousness and Justice were on his side he considered himself\r\nin the majority.  He was constant in his attendance on the\r\nworship of a small and unpopular religious denomination.\r\nHe never lost his good nature, his courage, or his supreme\r\nconfidence in the final triumph of truth.\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill was not a great political leader.  Great political\r\nleaders are not often found in the Senate nowadays.  He was\r\ncontented to be responsible for one man; to cast his share\r\nof the vote of one State; to do his duty as he conceived\r\nit, and let other men do theirs as they saw it.  But at least\r\nhe was not a great political follower.  He never committed\r\nhimself to the popular currents, nor studied the vanes to\r\nsee how the winds were blowing, nor sounded the depths and\r\nthe shallows before he decided on his own course.  There was\r\nno wire running to his seat from any centre of patronage or\r\npower.  To use a felicitous phrase, I think of Senator Morgan\r\nof Alabama, he did not \"come out of the door and cry 'Cuckoo!'\r\nwhen any clock struck elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill was a brave man--an independent man.  He never\r\nflinched from uttering his thought.  He was never afraid to\r\nvote alone.  He never troubled himself about majorities or\r\nadministrations, still less about crowds or mobs or spasms\r\nof popular excitement.  His standard of excellence was high.\r\nHe was severe, almost austere, in his judgments of other men.\r\nAnd yet, with all this, everybody liked him.  Everybody who\r\ncame to know him well loved him.  It seems strange that he\r\nnever incurred enmities or provoked resentments.  I suppose\r\nthe reason is that he never had any controversy with anybody.\r\nHe did not mingle in the discussion of the Senate as a debater.\r\nHe uttered his opinion and gave his reasons as if he were\r\nuttering judgments.  But he seldom or never undertook to reply\r\nto the men who differed from him, and he rarely, if ever,\r\nused the weapons of ridicule or sarcasm or invective, and he\r\nnever grew impassioned or angry.  He had, in a high degree,\r\nwhat Jeremy Taylor calls \"the endearment of prudent and temperate\r\nspeech.\"\r\n\r\nHe was one of the men that Washington would have loved and\r\nWashington would have leaned upon.  Of course I do not compare\r\nmy good friend with him to whom no man living or that ever\r\nlived on earth can be compared.  And Mr. Morrill was never\r\ntried or tested by executive or by military responsibilities.\r\nBut the qualities which belonged to Washington belonged to\r\nhim--prudence, modesty, sound judgement, simplicity, absolute\r\nveracity, absolute integrity, disinterestedness, lofty patriotism.\r\nIf he is not to be compared with Washington, he was at least\r\nworthy to be the countryman of Washington, and to hold a high\r\nplace among the statesmen of the Republic which Washington\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nNeither ambition nor hatred, nor the love of ease nor the\r\ngreed of gain, nor the desire of popularity, nor the love of\r\npraise, nor the fear of unpopularity found a place in that\r\nsimple and brave heart.\r\n\r\n  Like as a ship that through the ocean wide\r\n  By conduct of some star doth make her way--\r\n\r\nno local attraction diverted the magnet in his soul, which\r\never pointed to the star of day.\r\n\r\nAs I just said, he was one of the men that Washington would\r\nhave loved and that Washington would have leaned upon.  If\r\nwe do not speak of him as a man of genius, he had that absolute\r\nprobity and that sound common sense which are safer and better\r\nguides than genius.  These gifts are the highest ornaments\r\nof a noble and beautiful character; they are surer guides\r\nto success and loftier elements of true greatness than what\r\nis commonly called genius.  It was well said by an early American\r\nauthor,* now too much neglected, that--\r\n\r\n\"There is no virtue without a characteristic beauty.  To\r\ndo what is right argues superior taste as well as morals;\r\nand those whose practice is evil feel and inferiority of\r\nintellectual power and enjoyment, even where they take no\r\nconcern for a principle.  Doing well has something more in\r\nit than the mere fulfilling of a duty.  It is a cause of a just\r\nsense of elevation of character; it clears and strengthens\r\nthe spirits; it gives higher reaches of thought.  The world\r\nis sensible of these truths, let it act as it may.  It is not\r\nbecause of his integrity alone that it relies on an honest man,\r\nbut it has more confidence in his judgment and wise conduct,\r\nin the long run, than in the schemes of those of greater\r\nintellect who go at large without any landmarks of principle.\r\nSo that virtue seems of a double nature, and to stand oftentimes\r\nin the place of what we call talent.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Richard H. Dana, the elder.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nHe was spared the fate of so many of our great New England\r\nstatesmen, that of closing his life in sorrow and in gloom.\r\nHis last days were days of hope, not of despair.  Sumner came\r\nto his seat in the Senate Chamber as to a solitude.  When\r\nhe was struck with death there was found upon his table a\r\nvolume of Shakespeare with this passage, probably the last\r\nprinted text on which his eyes ever gazed, marked with his\r\nown hand:\r\n\r\n  Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;\r\n  For what is in this world, but care and woe?\r\n\r\nThe last days of Samuel Adams were embittered by poverty,\r\nsickness, and the death of his only son.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster laid wearily down his august head in disappointment\r\nand sorrow, predicting with dying breath that the end had\r\ncome to the great party to whose service his life was given.\r\n\r\nWhen John Quincy Adams fell at his post in the House of Representatives\r\na great newspaper declared that there could not be found in\r\nthe country another bold enough or bad enough to take his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Morrill's last days were filled with hope and not\r\nwith despair.  To him life was sweet and immortality assured.\r\nHis soul took its flight\r\n\r\n  On wings that fear no glance of God's pure sight,\r\n  No tempest from his breath.\r\n\r\nAnd so we leave him.  His life went out with the century\r\nof which he saw almost the beginning.  What the future may\r\nhave in store for us we cannot tell.  But we offer this man\r\nas an example of an American Senator and American citizen\r\nthan which, so far, we have none better.  Surely that life\r\nhas been fortunate.  He is buried where he was born.  His\r\nhonored grave is hard by the spot where his cradle was rocked.\r\nHe sleeps where he wished to sleep, in the bosom of his beloved\r\nVermont.  No State ever mourned a nobler son; no son was ever\r\nmourned by a nobler State.  He enjoyed to a ripe old age everything\r\nthat can make life happy--honor, love, obedience, troops of\r\nfriends,\r\n\r\n  The love of friends without a single foe,\r\n  Unequalled lot below.\r\n\r\nHe died at home.  The desire of the wise man,\r\n\r\n  Let me die in my nest,\r\n\r\nwas fulfilled to him.  His eyes in his old age looked undimmed\r\nupon the greatness and the glory of his country, in achieving\r\nwhich he had borne so large a part.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nCOMMITTEE SERVICE IN THE SENATE\r\n\r\nI was appointed upon the Committee on Privileges and Elections,\r\nMarch 9, 1877, and have continued a member of it ever since.\r\n\r\nI was appointed on the same day a member of the Committees\r\non Claims, Indian Affairs and Agriculture.  I made a special\r\nstudy in the vacation of 1877, expecting to master, as well\r\nas I could, the whole Indian question, so that my service\r\non that Committee might be of some value.  But I was removed\r\nfrom the Committee on Indian Affairs, by the Committee who\r\nmade the appointments, in the following December.  This was\r\nvery fortunate, for the country and for the Indians.  Mr.\r\nDawes, my colleague, not long after was placed upon the Committee.\r\nHe was a most intelligent, faithful and stanch friend of the\r\nIndians during the remainder of his lifetime.  He was ready,\r\nat the Department and on the floor of the Senate, and wherever\r\nhe could exert an influence to protect and baffle any attempt\r\nto wrong them.  His quiet and unpretending service to this\r\nunfortunate and oppressed race entitles him to a very high\r\nplace in the affectionate remembrance of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Agriculture was then of little importance.\r\nI remained a member of it for a few years, and then gave it\r\nup for some service in which my constituents were more immediately\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1878, I was put on the Committee on Patents,\r\nand remained upon it for a little while.  The Committee had\r\nto deal occasionally with special cases of applications for\r\nextension of patents by statute, which demanded a knowledge\r\nof the patent law, and industry and sound judgment on the\r\npart of the Senator to whom they were committed for report.\r\nBut they were not of much public interest or importance.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1879, I was put on the Committee on the Revision\r\nof the Laws; in December, 1883, on the Joint Committee on\r\nthe Library; in December, 1884, on the Committee of the Judiciary,\r\nof which I have been a member ever since; in December, 1888,\r\non the Committee on Relations with Canada; in December, 1891,\r\non the Committee on Woman Suffrage; in December, 1895, on\r\nthe Committee on Rules.\r\n\r\nI was on the Committee on Claims for ten years, from March\r\n9, 1877, to March 4, 1887.  It is impossible to establish\r\nby the record the part any man performs, who is a member of\r\na deliberative body consisting of several persons, in influencing\r\nits decisions, or in establishing the principles on which\r\nthey are based.  But I believe I may fairly claim, and that\r\nI could cite my associates on the Committee to bear testimony,\r\nthat I had a great deal to do, and much more than any other\r\nperson, in settling the doctrines upon which the Senate acted\r\nin dealing with the great questions of the claims of individuals\r\nand States and corporate bodies growing out of the War.  Upon\r\nthe rules then established the Government claims amounting\r\nto hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars were decided.\r\nThe victorious Republic dealt justly and generously with the\r\nvanquished and misguided men who had assailed it and sought\r\nits destruction.\r\n\r\nThe general doctrines by which Congress was governed were\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n1.  No rightful claim accrued to anybody for the destruction\r\nor injury to property by military movements, or operations,\r\nin a country which was the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n2.  A fair price was to be paid for supplies for the use of\r\nthe Army in the field (1) to loyal persons, (2) to disloyal\r\npersons, if it were shown by a certificate of the officer who\r\ntook them, or otherwise, that they were taken with the purpose\r\nof paying for them.  Inhabitants of States in rebellion were\r\npresumed to be disloyal, unless their loyalty were shown affirmatively.\r\n\r\n3.  A like rule was followed in determining the questions\r\nof payment for the use of buildings, occupied as soldiers'\r\nquarters, or for other official purposes, by the Army, or\r\ninjury to them caused by such occupation.\r\n\r\n4.  Property taken by the Army was paid for at its actual\r\nvalue to the Government, and not necessarily at its value\r\nto owner.\r\n\r\n5.  No claim accrued by reason of the destruction of property\r\nwhether of loyal or disloyal persons, to prevent its falling\r\ninto the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n6.  An exception to the principle above stated, founded not\r\non any strict principle or established law or conduct of Governments,\r\nbut on sound public policy, was adopted in the case of institutions\r\nof charity, education and religion.\r\n\r\nI first affirmed that doctrine in the House of Representatives,\r\nin the case of the College of William and Mary of Virginia,\r\nagainst the almost unanimous opinion of my political associates.\r\nI thought that such a principle would be a great protection\r\nto such institutions in all future wars, that it would tend\r\nto heal the bitter recollections of the Civil War and the\r\nestrangements then existing between the sections of the country.\r\nI have lived to see the doctrine thoroughly established, the\r\nCollege of William and Mary rebuilt by the Government, and\r\nevery church and school and hospital which suffered by the\r\nmilitary operations of the Civil War reimbursed, if it has\r\npresented its claim.\r\n\r\nIf I have been able to render any public service, I look\r\nupon that I have rendered upon the Committee on Claims, although\r\nit has attracted but little attention, and is not of a nature\r\nto make great public impression, as perhaps more valuable\r\nthan any other.\r\n\r\nThe duties of that Committee, when I was upon it, were very\r\nlaborious.  I find that in the first session of the first\r\nCongress, I made reports in seventeen cases, each of them\r\ninvolving a study of the evidence, a finding of the facts, and\r\nan investigation, statement and consideration of important\r\nprinciples of law, in most cases to be applied to a novel state\r\nof facts.  I think that winter's work upon the Committee on\r\nClaims alone required more individual labor than that required\r\nto perform the duties of his office by any Judge of a State\r\nCourt, of which I have any knowledge; and that the amount\r\nof money, and importance of the principles involved very far\r\nexceeded that involved in the aggregate of the cases in the\r\nSupreme Court of any State for a like period.\r\n\r\nI was a member of the Committee on the Library for several\r\nyears.  For two or three years I was its acting Chairman\r\nduring the summer, and in that capacity had to approve the\r\naccounts of the Congressional Library, and the National Botanic\r\nGarden.\r\n\r\nTo that Committee were referred applications for the erection\r\nof monuments and statues and similar works throughout the\r\ncountry, including the District of Columbia, and the purchase\r\nof works for art for the Government.  They used to have a\r\nregular appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars annually,\r\nto be expended at their discretion, for works of art.  That\r\nappropriation was stopped some years ago.\r\n\r\nMy service on that Committee brought me into very delightful\r\nrelations with Mr. Sherman and Mr. Evarts.  I introduced and\r\ngot through a bill for a monument and statue to Lafayette\r\nand, as acting Chairman of the Library Committee was, with\r\nthe Secretary of War and the Architect of the Capitol, a member\r\nof the Commission who selected the artists and contracted\r\nfor the statue and monument.  A resolution to build the monument\r\npassed the Continental Congress, but was not carried into\r\neffect by reason of the poverty of the Confederacy in that\r\nday.  In Washington's first Administration somebody called\r\nattention to the fact that the monument had not been built,\r\nto which my grandfather, Roger Sherman, answered: \"The vote\r\nis the monument.\" I was led by the anecdote to do what I could\r\nto have the long-neglected duty performed.  The statue and\r\nmonument, by two French artists of great genius, now stands\r\nat one corner of Lafayette Square.  The statue of Rochambeau\r\nhas just been placed at another corner of that square.\r\n\r\nI was also fortunate enough, when I was on the Library Committee,\r\nto secure the purchase of the Franklin Papers for the Department\r\nof State.  William Temple Franklin, the Doctor's son, died\r\nin London, leaving at his lodgings a mass of valuable correspondence\r\nof his father, and other papers illustrating his life, especially\r\nin France.  They were discovered in the possession of the\r\nkeeper of his lodgings, many years after, by Henry Stevens,\r\nthe famous antiquary and dealer in rare books.  Stevens had\r\ngot into difficulties about money, and had pledged the collection\r\nfor about twenty-five thousand dollars.  It had been offered\r\nto the Government.  Several Secretaries of State, in succession,\r\nincluding Mr. Blaine, had urged Congress to buy it, but without\r\navail.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Dwight, Librarian of the State Department, came\r\nto see me at the Capitol about some not very important matter.\r\nWhile I was talking with him, he said that the one thing he\r\nwished most was that Congress would buy the Franklin Papers.\r\nHe added \"I think if I were to die, the words 'Franklin Papers,'\r\nwould be found engraved on my heart.\" I said I thought I could\r\naccomplish the purchase.  So I introduced a resolution, had\r\nit referred to the Library Committee, and we had a hearing.\r\nIt happened that Edward Everett Hale, who probably knew as\r\nmuch about the subject and the value of the papers as anybody,\r\nwas then in Washington.  At the same time John Russell Bartlett\r\nwas here, who had charge of the famous Brown Collection in\r\nRhode Island.  They were both summoned before the Committee,\r\nand on their statement the Committee voted to recommend the\r\npassage of the resolution.  It passed the Senate.  The provision\r\nwas then put upon the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill.  With\r\nit, however, was a provision to buy the Rochambeau Papers,\r\nwhich had been sent to this county on the assurance of Mr.\r\nSherman, who was Chairman of the Committee on the Library,\r\nthat Congress would purchase them.  There was also a provision\r\nfor buying the papers of Vans Murray, Envoy to France in Napoleon's\r\ntime; and for buying two other quite important manuscript\r\ncollections.  When the bill got to the House, all these things\r\nwere stricken out.  The Conference Committee had a great strife\r\nover them, the House refusing to put any of them in, and the\r\nSenate insisting upon all.  At last they compromised, agreeing\r\nto take them alternately, including the first one, rejecting\r\nthe second; including the third, rejecting the fourth, and\r\nso on.  In this lottery the Franklin Papers were saved, and\r\nMr. Sherman's Rochambeau Papers were stricken out, much to\r\nhis disgust.  But he got an appropriation for them in a subsequent\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Rules have the control of the Capitol, and\r\nthe not very important power of assigning the rooms to the\r\ndifferent Committees.  Beyond that they have not, in general,\r\nmuch to do.  There have been few important amendments to the\r\nrules in my time, of which I was the author of two.\r\n\r\nOne of them provides that an amendment to any bill may be\r\nlaid on the table, on special motion, without carrying the\r\nbill itself with it.  The motion to lay on the table not being\r\ndebatable, this enables the Senate to dispose promptly of\r\na good many propositions, which otherwise would consume a\r\ngood deal of time in debate.  There had been such a provision\r\nas to appropriation bills before.  When I first suggested\r\nthis change, Mr. Edmunds exclaimed in a loud whisper, \"we\r\nwon't do that.\"  But I believe he approved it finally.\r\n\r\nThe other was an amendment relating to order in debate, made\r\nnecessary by a very disagreeable occurrence, which ended in\r\nthe exchange of blows in the Senate, by two Senators from\r\nthe same State.  I had long in mind to propose, when the occasion\r\ncame, the last clause of this amendment.  If Senators are\r\nto be considered to any degree as ambassadors of their States,\r\nit would seem proper that they should not be compelled to\r\nhear any reproachful language about the State they represent.\r\nSuch attacks have given rise to a great deal of angry debate\r\nin both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe following is the amendment:\r\n\r\nNo Senator in debate shall directly or indirectly by any\r\nform of words impute to any Senator or to other Senators\r\nany conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\r\n\r\nNo Senator in debate shall refer offensively to any State\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nI was also for several years a member of the Committee on\r\nWoman Suffrage.  That Committee used to hear the advocates\r\nof Woman Suffrage who liked to have their arguments reported\r\nand sent through the mails as public documents under the franking\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nAlthough a very decided advocate of the extension of the\r\nright of suffrage to women, I have not thought that it was\r\nlikely that that would be accomplished by an amendment to\r\nthe National Constitution, or indeed that it was wise to\r\nattempt to do it in that way.  The Constitution cannot be\r\namended without the consent of three-fourths of the States.\r\nIf a majority can be got in three-fourths of the States for\r\nsuch an amendment, their people would be undoubtedly ready\r\nto amend their State Constitutions by which, so far as each\r\nState is concerned, the object would be accomplished.  So\r\nit seems hardly worth while to take the trouble of plying\r\nCongress with petitions or arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut my longest service upon Committees has been upon the two\r\ngreat Law Committees of the Senate,--the Committee on Privileges\r\nand Elections, and the Committee on the Judiciary.\r\n\r\nI have been a member of the Committee on Privileges and Elections\r\nsince March 9, 1877.  I was Chairman for more than ten years.\r\nI have been a member of the Committee on the Judiciary since\r\nDecember, 1884, and have been its Chairman since December,\r\n1891, except for two years, from March 4, 1893, to March 4,\r\n1895, when the Democrats held the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhile I was Chairman it was of course my duty to represent\r\nand defend in debate the action of these Committees on all\r\nthe important questions referred to them.  I have also, by\r\nreason of my long service, now more than twenty-six years,\r\non the Committee of Privileges and Elections, been expected\r\nto take part in the discussion of all the Election cases,\r\nand of all matters affecting the privileges and dignity of\r\nthe Senate, and of individual Senators.  The investigations\r\ninto alleged outrages at the South, and wrongs connected with\r\nthem, have been conducted by that Committee.  So it has been\r\nmy fortune to be prominent in nearly all of the matters that\r\nhave come up in the Senate since I have been a member of it,\r\nwhich have excited angry sectional or political feeling.  Matters\r\nof finance and revenue and protection, while deeply interesting\r\nthe people, do not, in general, cause angry feeling on the\r\npart of the political leaders.  To this remark, the state\r\nof mind of our friends, whom we are in the habit of calling\r\nMugwumps, and who like to call themselves Independents, is\r\nan exception.  They have commonly discussed the profoundest\r\nand subtlest questions with an angry and bitter personality\r\nwhich finds its parallel only in the theological treatises\r\nof the dark ages.  It is lucky for some of us that they have\r\nnot had the fires of Smithfield or of the Inquisition at their\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nSo, at various times in my life, I have been the object of\r\nthe most savage denunciation, sometimes from the Independent\r\nnewspapers, sometimes from the Democratic newspapers, especially\r\nthose in the South, and sometimes from the press of my own\r\nparty whom I have offended by differing from a majority of\r\nmy political friends.\r\n\r\nBut such things are not to be taken too seriously.  I have\r\nfound in general that the men who deliver themselves with\r\nmost bitterness and fury on political questions are the men\r\nwho change their minds most easily, and are in general the\r\nmost placable, and not uncommonly are the most friendly and\r\npleasant men in the world in private intercourse.  I account\r\nit my great good fortune that, although I have never flinched\r\nfrom uttering whatever I thought, and acting according to\r\nmy own conviction of public duty, that, as I am approaching\r\nfour score years, I have, almost without an exception, the\r\ngood will of my countrymen, certainly if I may trust what\r\nthey tell me when I meet in private intercourse men from different\r\nparts of the country, or what they are saying of me just now\r\nin the press.  But it is quite possible that I may say or\r\ndo something before I get through which will change all that.\r\nSo whether my sunset, which is to come very soon, is to be\r\nclear or under a cloud, it is impossible even to guess.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I have taken a leading part in all questions\r\naffecting the security of the right of suffrage conferred\r\nby the Constitution of the United States on the colored people,\r\nof honesty in elections, of questions affecting disputed titles\r\nto seats in the Senate, and the extension of suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nA very interesting question, now happily almost forgotten,\r\ncame up at the December session of 1878, and was renewed at\r\nthe following March session of 1879.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives,\r\nwhile the Republicans had the Presidency and the Senate.  In\r\nMarch, 1879, there was a Democratic majority in the Senate\r\nand in the House, but a Republican President.  The Democratic\r\nParty chafed exceedingly under the National laws for securing\r\nthe purity of elections and for securing impartial juries\r\nin the courts of the United States.  In the December session\r\nof 1878, the House inserted a provision repealing these laws.\r\nThey insisted, in conference, on keeping in this provision,\r\nand refused to consent to the passage of the Executive, Legislative\r\nand Judicial Appropriation Bill, unless the Senate and the\r\nPresident would yield to their demand.  Mr. Beck of Kentucky,\r\none of the conferrees on the part of the Senate, representing\r\nwhat was then the Democratic minority, but what became at\r\nthe March session the majority, stated the doctrine of the\r\nHouse, as announced by their conferrees--adding that he agreed\r\nwith it--that unless the States should be allowed to conduct\r\ntheir own elections in their own way, free from all Federal\r\ninterference, they would refuse under their Constitutional\r\nright to make appropriations to carry on the Government.\r\n\r\nThis was in defiance of the express provision of the Constitution\r\nthat Congress might at any time alter the regulations prescribed\r\nby the State Legislatures as to time, place and manner of\r\nholding elections for Senators and Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck declared that that course would be adopted and adhered\r\nto, no matter what came of the Appropriation Bills.  He was\r\nfollowed by Mr. Thurman of Ohio, the leader of his party in\r\nthe Senate, and Chairman of the Judiciary when it came into\r\npower.  He said it was a question upon which he had thought\r\nlong and deeply, one of the gravest which ever arose for the\r\nconsideration of the American Congress, and added:\r\n\r\n\"We claim the right, which the House of Commons in England\r\nestablished after two centuries of contest, to say that we\r\nwill not grant the money of the people unless there is a redress\r\nof grievances . . . . England was saved from despotism and an\r\nabsolute monarchy by the exercise of the power of the House\r\nof Commons to refuse supplies except upon conditions that\r\ngrievances should be redressed . . . . It is a mistake to suppose\r\nthat it was a fight simply between the Throne and the Commons;\r\nit was equally a fight between the Lords and the Commons;\r\nand the result of two centuries of contest in England was\r\nthe rule that the House of Lords had no right to amend a Money\r\nBill.\"\r\n\r\nThis startling proposition claimed that it was in the power\r\nof the House of Representatives to control the entire legislation\r\nof the country.  It could, if the doctrine of Mr. Beck and\r\nMr. Thurman had prevailed, impose any condition upon an appropriation\r\nfor the Judges' salaries, for the salaries of all executive\r\nofficers, for carrying on the courts, and for all other functions\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nI made a careful study of this question and satisfied the\r\nSenate,--and I think I satisfied Mr. Beck and Mr. Thurman,\r\n--that the doctrine had no support in this country, and had\r\nno support even in England.  An examination of Parliamentary\r\nhistory, which I studied carefully, afforded the material\r\nfor giving a narrative of every occasion when the Commons\r\nexerted their power of withholding supplies as a means of\r\ncompelling a redress of grievances, from the Conquest to the\r\npresent hour.  I did not undertake in a speech in the Senate\r\nto recite the authorities in full.  But I summed up the result\r\nof the English and American doctrine in a few sentences, which\r\nmay be worth recording here.\r\n\r\n\"First.  The Commons never withheld the supplies as a means\r\nof coercing the assent of the Crown or the Lords to _legislation._\r\n\r\n\"Second.  The supplies withheld were not the supplies needed\r\nfor the ordinary functions of government, to which the ordinary\r\nrevenues of the Crown were sufficient, but were for extraordinary\r\noccasions, as to pay the King's debts, or to conduct foreign\r\nwars.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  That when the hereditary revenues of the Crown,\r\nor those settled on the King for life at the beginning of his\r\nreign, ceased to be sufficient for the maintenance of government\r\nand for public defence, the practice of withholding supplies\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  There has been no instance since the Revolution\r\nof 1688 of attaching general legislation to a bill for raising\r\nor appropriating money, and scarcely, if ever, such an instance\r\nbefore that date.  When such an attempt has been made it has\r\nbeen resisted, denounced and abandoned, and the English Constitutional\r\nauthorities, without exception, are agreed that such a proceeding\r\nis unwarrantable, revolutionary and destructive of the English\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that the luxury or ambition of Kings or their\r\nindulgent bounty to their favorites led them to assemble\r\nParliament and to ask additional supplies from their subjects.\r\nIt is also true that these requests furnished the occasion\r\nto the Commons to stipulate for redress of grievances.  But\r\nthe grievances so redressed had no relation to the laws of\r\nthe Realm.  These laws were made or altered by the free assent\r\nof the three estates in whom the law-making power vested by\r\nthe Constitution.  The grievances of which the Commons sought\r\nredress, whether from Tudor, Plantagenet or Stuart, were the\r\nimproper use of prerogatives, the granting of oppressive monopolies,\r\nthe waging of costly foreign wars, the misconduct of favorites\r\nand the like.  The improvident expenditure of the royal patrimony,\r\nthe granting the crown land or pensions to unworthy persons,\r\nis a frequent ground of complaint.\r\n\r\n\"But there is a broader and simpler distinction between the\r\ntwo cases.  The mistake, the gross, palpable mistake, which\r\nthese gentlemen fall into in making this comparison, lies\r\nat the threshold.  The House of Commons, in its discretion,\r\nused to grant, and sometimes now grants, supplies to the King.\r\nThe American Congress, in its discretion, never grants supplies\r\nto the President under any circumstances whatever.  The only\r\nappropriation of the public money to which that term can properly\r\napply, the provision for the President's compensation, is\r\nby design and of purpose placed wholly out of the power of\r\nCongress.  The provision is peremptory that--\r\n\r\n\"'The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services\r\na compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished\r\nduring the period for which he shall have been elected, and\r\nhe shall not receive within that period any other emolument\r\nfrom the United States, or any of them.'\r\n\r\n\"Alexander Hamilton, in No. 72 of the 'Federalist,' declares\r\nthat the very purpose of this enactment is to put it beyond\r\nthe power of Congress to compel the President 'to surrender\r\nat discretion his judgment to their inclinations.'\"\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after I entered the Senate the case came\r\nup of the title of William Pitt Kellogg to a seat in the\r\nSenate from Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1877, a Republican Legislature was organized\r\nin Louisiana, which recognized Mr. Packard as the lawful Governor\r\nof the State.  Packard had been elected, according to the\r\nclaim of the Republicans, at the same election at which the\r\nRepublican electors, who cast their votes for President Hayes,\r\nhad been chosen.  That Legislature elected Kellogg.  When\r\nPresident Hayes refused to continue his support of the Republican\r\ngovernment in Louisiana by military force, the Democrats organized\r\nthe Legislature, a Democratic Governor took possession of\r\npower, and the Republican State Legislature melted away.  It\r\nhad done little or nothing, except to elect Mr. Kellogg.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Democrats on the Committee\r\non Privileges and Elections, and in the Senate, claimed that\r\nthe recognition of the Democratic Governor had an ex post\r\nfacto operation which determined the title and right of the\r\nLegislature who undertook to elect Mr. Spofford, Mr. Kellogg's\r\ncompetitor.  The Republicans, on the other hand, claimed that\r\nnothing which occurred afterward could operate to determine\r\nthe question of the lawfulness of the Kellogg Legislature,\r\nor its power to elect a Senator.  That must be settled by\r\nthe law and the fact.  Upon these we thought Kellogg's title\r\nto be clear.  Kellogg was seated.  But when the Democrats\r\ngot a majority, two years later, the Committee on Privileges\r\nand Elections, under the lead of Benjamin H. Hill of Georgia,\r\nundertook to set aside this judgment, and to seat Mr. Spofford.\r\nMr. Hill made a long and, it is unnecessary to say, an able\r\nreport, setting forth the view taken by himself and by the\r\nmajority of the Committee, and recommended the admission of\r\nMr. Spofford.  I advised the Republican minority to decline\r\nto follow the Democrats into the discussion of the evidence,\r\nand to put the case alone and squarely on the authority of\r\nthe previous judgment of the Senate.  This I did in the following\r\nreport:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, a minority of the Committee on Privileges\r\nand Elections, to whom was referred the memorial of Henry\r\nM. Spofford, claiming the seat now occupied by William Pitt\r\nKellogg, submit the following as their views:\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of November, 1877, the Senate passed the following\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That William Pitt Kellogg is, upon the merits\r\nof the case, entitled to a seat in the Senate of the United\r\nStates from the State of Louisiana for the term of six years,\r\ncommencing on the 4th of March, 1877, and that he be admitted\r\nthereto on taking the proper oath.\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That Henry M. Spofford is not entitled to a\r\nseat in the Senate of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe party majority in the Senate has changed since Mr. Kellogg\r\ntook the oath of office in pursuance of the above resolution.\r\nNothing else has changed.  The facts which the Senate considered\r\nand determined were in existence then, as now.  It is sought,\r\nby a mere superiority of numbers, for the first time, to thrust\r\na Senator from the seat which he holds by virtue of the express\r\nand deliberate final judgment of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe act which is demanded of this party majority would be,\r\nin our judgment, a great public crime.  It will be, if consummated,\r\none of the great political crimes in American history, to\r\nbe classed with the Rebellion, with the attempt to take possession\r\nby fraud of the State Government of Maine, and with the overthrow\r\nof State Governments in the South, of which it is the fitting\r\nsequence.  Political parties have too often been led by partisan\r\nzeal into measures which a sober judgment might disapprove;\r\nbut they have ever respected the constitution of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe men whose professions of returning loyalty to the Constitution\r\nhave been trusted by the generous confidence of the American\r\npeople are now to give evidence of the sincerity of their\r\nvows.  The people will thoroughly understand this matter,\r\nand will not likely to be deceived again.\r\n\r\nWe do not think proper to enter here upon a discussion of\r\nthe evidence by which the claimant of Mr. Kellogg's seat\r\nseeks to establish charges affecting the integrity of that\r\nSenator.  Such evidence can be found in abundance in the\r\nslums of great cities.  It is not fit to be trusted in cases\r\naffecting the smallest amount of property, much less the\r\nhonor of an eminent citizen, or the title to an object of so\r\nmuch desire as a seat in the Senate.  This evidence is not\r\nonly unworthy of respect or credit, but it is in many instances\r\nwholly irreconcilable with undisputed facts, and Mr. Kellogg\r\nhas met and overthrown it at every point.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE F. HOAR,\r\n  ANGUS CAMERON,\r\n  JOHN A. LOGAN.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic majority presented their report, without asking\r\nto have it read.  Then we of the minority presented ours,\r\nand had it read.  It attracted the attention of the Senate\r\nand of the country.  My report contains but a few sentences.\r\nThat of the Democratic minority occupies eight columns of\r\nvery fine print in the Congressional Record.  The result was\r\nthat some of the Southern Democrats, including Mr. Bayard\r\nof Delaware, General Gordon of Georgia, General Wade Hampton\r\nof South Carolina, and Mr. Pendleton, of Ohio, refused to\r\nsupport their associates in the extreme measure of unseating\r\na Senator when nothing had happened to affect the judgment\r\nwhich seated him, except that the majority of the Senate had\r\nchanged.  Some of the Democratic gentlemen, however, while\r\nresting upon the old judgment of the Senate, and while refusing\r\nto set that aside, thought the Democratic charges made out\r\non the evidence, and that Mr. Kellogg's conduct and character\r\ndeserved the severest denunciation.  Senator Pendleton, of\r\nOhio, however, with a courage and manliness that did him infinite\r\ncredit, after stating what his Democratic brethren said: \"I\r\nam bound to say that I have read the evidence carefully, and\r\nthere is nothing in it that in the least warrants any imputation\r\nupon the integrity of that Senator.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of my Committee service, perhaps I ought to say\r\nthat I was appointed one of the Regents of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution in the year 1881.  I liked the position exceedingly.\r\nI was very much interested in the work of the Institution,\r\nand enjoyed meeting the eminent scholars and men of science\r\nwho were its members.  After I had been a member a year or\r\ntwo a very eminent Republican Senator complained that I was\r\ngetting more than my share of the prominent places in the\r\ngift of the Senate, and specified the Regency of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution as an instance.  I thought there was great justice\r\nin the complaint, and accordingly I resigned and Justin S.\r\nMorrill was put in my place.  It was a very fortunate thing.\r\nMr. Morrill's influence secured the construction of the National\r\nMuseum building, which I do not think it likely that I could\r\nhave accomplished.  That Museum was then in charge of the\r\nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar thing happened to me later.  In the year\r\n1885 the Nominating Committee of the Senate, of which Senator\r\nAllison was then Chairman, proposed my name for the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations.  I should have liked that service very\r\nmuch.  I should have liked to study the history of our diplomacy,\r\nand the National interests specially in charge of that Committee,\r\nbetter than anything else I can think of.  But I was then\r\na member of the Committees on the Judiciary, Privileges and\r\nElections, Library, Patents and the Select Committee to Inquire\r\ninto the Claims of Citizens of the United States against Nicaragua,\r\nno one of which I desired to give up.  On the other hand,\r\nSenator Frye of Maine, a very able Senator to whom the Republicans\r\nof Massachusetts were under special obligations for his services\r\nin their campaigns, was not at that time placed in positions\r\non Committee service such as his ability and merit entitled\r\nhim to.  Accordingly I told the Committee I thought they had\r\nbetter amend their report and put Mr. Frye on the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations instead of myself.  That was done.\r\n\r\nI incline to think that if that had not been done, and I\r\nhad remained on the Committee for Foreign Relations, that\r\nI could have defeated the Spanish Treaty, prevented the destruction\r\nof the Republic in the Philippine Islands, and the commitment\r\nof this country to the doctrine that we can govern dependencies\r\nunder our Constitution, in which the people have no political\r\nor Constitutional rights but such as Congress choose to recognize.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that modesty or disinterestedness has much\r\nplace in the matter of the acceptance of high political office.\r\nWe often hear a gentleman say:  \"I am not fit to be Judge;\r\nI am not fit to be Governor, or Senator, or member of Congress.\r\nI think other men are better qualified, and I will not consent\r\nto stand in their way.\"  This is often said with the utmost\r\nsincerity.  But anybody who acts on such a feeling ought to\r\nremember that if he accept the office, it will not be filled\r\nby a worse man than he; if he accept the office, it being\r\na political office, he is sure that the office will be filled\r\nby a man who will desire to accomplish, and will do his best\r\nto accomplish, the things he thinks for the public good.  He\r\nshould also remember, so far as the matter of ability is concerned,\r\nthat other men are likely to be much better judges of his\r\ncapacity than he is himself.  If men are likely often to overrate\r\ntheir own capacity, they are also very often likely to underrate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLet me not be understood as commending the miserable self-\r\nseeking which too often leads men to urge their own claims\r\nwithout regard to the public interests.  A man who is his\r\nown candidate is commonly a very bad candidate for his party.\r\n\r\nOne vote, more than once, would have saved the country from\r\nwhat I think its wretched policy in regard to the Philippine\r\nIslands.  There was just one vote to spare when the Spanish\r\nTreaty was ratified.  One Senator waited before voting until\r\nthe roll-call was over and the list of the votes read by the\r\nclerk, before the finally voted for the treaty.  He said he\r\ndid not wish to butt his head against the sentiment of his\r\nState if he could do no good; but if his vote would defeat\r\nit, he should vote against it.  If there had been one less\r\nvote, his vote would have defeated it.  The Treaty would have\r\nbeen lost, in my opinion, if Senator Gray, one of the Commissioners\r\nwho made it, who earnestly protested against it, but afterward\r\nsupported it, had not been a member of the Commission.  The\r\nresolution of Mr. Bacon, declaring our purpose to recognize\r\nthe independence of the Philippine people, if they desired\r\nit, was lost also by a single vote.  The Philippine Treaty\r\nwould have been lost but for Mr. Bryan's personal interposition\r\nin its behalf.  It would have been defeated, in my judgment,\r\nif Speaker Reed, a man second in influence and in power in\r\nthis country to President McKinley alone, had seen it to be\r\nhis duty to remain in public life, and lead the fight against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is rarely safe for a man who is in political\r\nlife for public, and not for personal ends, and who values\r\nthe political principles which he professes, to decline any\r\nposition of power, either from modesty, doubt of his own\r\nability, or from a desire to be generous to other men.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy twenty years' service on the Committee on the Judiciary,\r\nso far as it is worth narrating, will appear in the account\r\nof the various legal and Constitutional questions which it\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE RIVER AND HARBOR BILL\r\n\r\nI have throughout my whole public political life acted upon\r\nmy own judgment.  I have done what I thought for the public\r\ninterest without much troubling myself about public opinion.\r\nI always took a good deal of pride in a saying of Roger Sherman's.\r\nHe was asked if he did not think some vote of his would be\r\nvery much disapproved in Connecticut, to which he replied\r\nthat he knew but one way to ascertain the public opinion of\r\nConnecticut; that was to ascertain what was right.  When he\r\nhad found that out, he was quite sure that it would meet the\r\napproval of Connecticut.  That in general has been in my judgment\r\nabsolutely and literally true of Massachusetts.  It has required\r\nno courage for any representative of hers to do what he thought\r\nwas right.  She is apt to select to speak for her, certainly\r\nthose she sends to the United States Senate, in whose choice\r\nthe whole Commonwealth has a part, men who are in general\r\nof the same way of thinking, and governed by the same principles\r\nas are the majority of her people.  When she has chosen them\r\nshe expects them to act according to their best judgement,\r\nand not to be thinking about popularity.  She likes independence\r\nbetter than obsequiousness.  The one thing the people of Massachusetts\r\nwill not forgive in a public servant is that he should act\r\nagainst his own honest judgment to please them.  I am speaking\r\nof her sober, second thought.  Her people, like the rest of\r\nmankind, are liable to waves of emotion and of prejudice.\r\nThis is true the world over.  It is as true of good men as\r\nof bad men, of educated as of ignorant men, whenever they\r\nare to act in large masses.  Alexander Hamilton said that\r\nif every Athenian citizen had been a Socrates, still every\r\nAthenian assembly would have been a mob.  So I claim no credit\r\nthat I have voted and spoken as I thought, always without\r\nstopping to consider whether public opinion would support\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe only serious temptation I have ever had in my public\r\nlife came to me in the summer of 1882, when the measure known\r\nas the River and Harbor Bill was pending.  The bill provided\r\nfor an expenditure of about eighteen million dollars.  Of\r\nthis a little more than four million was for the execution\r\nof a scheme for the improvement of the Mississippi River and\r\nits tributaries, which had been recommended by President Arthur\r\nin a special message.  All the other appropriations put together\r\nwere a little less than fourteen million dollars.  The bill\r\npassed both Houses.  President Arthur vetoed it, alleging\r\nas a reason that the measure was extravagant; that the public\r\nworks provided for in it were of local interest, not for the\r\nadvantage of international or interstate commerce; and that\r\nit had got through by a system of log-rolling, the friends\r\nof bad schemes in one State joining with the friends of bad\r\nschemes in another, making common cause to support the bill.\r\nHe added that in that way, the more objectionable the measure,\r\nthe more support it would get.  The press of the country,\r\nalmost without exception, supported the President.  The reasons\r\nwhich applied to each improvement were not well understood\r\nby the public.  So the conductors of the newspapers naturally\r\nsupposed the President to be in the right in his facts.  The\r\nDemocratic newspapers were eager to attack Republican measures.\r\nWhere there were factions in the Republican Party, the Republican\r\npapers of one faction were ready to attack the men who belonged\r\nto the other.  The independent newspapers welcomed any opportunity\r\nto support their theory that American public life was rotten\r\nand corrupt.  So when the question came up whether the bill\r\nshould pass notwithstanding the objections of the President,\r\nthere was a storm of indignation throughout the country against\r\nthe men who supported it.\r\n\r\nBut the committees who had supported it and who had reported\r\nit, and who knew its merits, and the men who had voted for\r\nit in either House of Congress, could not well stultify themselves\r\nby changing their votes, although some of them did.  I was\r\nsituated very fortunately in that respect.  I had been absent\r\non a visit to Massachusetts when the bill passed.  So I was\r\nnot on record for it.  I had given it no great attention.\r\nThe special duties which had been assigned to me related to\r\nother subjects.  So when the measure came up in the Senate\r\nI had only an opinion founded on my general knowledge of the\r\nneeds of the country and the public policy, that it was all\r\nright.  My reelection was coming on.  I was to have a serious\r\ncontest, if I were a candidate, with the supporters of General\r\nButler, then very powerful in the State.  He, in fact, was\r\nelected Governor in the election then approaching.  My first\r\nthoughts were that I was fortunate to have escaped this rock.\r\nBut when the vote came on I said to myself: \"This measure\r\nis right.  Is my father's son to sneak home to Massachusetts,\r\nhaving voted against a bill that is clearly righteous and\r\njust, because he is afraid of public sentiment?\" Senator McMillan,\r\nthe Chairman of the Committee who had charge of the bill,\r\njust before my name was called, asked me how I meant to vote.\r\nI told him I should vote for the bill, because I believed\r\nit to be right, but that it would lose me the support of every\r\nnewspaper in Massachusetts that had been friendly to me before.\r\nI voted accordingly.  The vote was met by a storm of indignation\r\nfrom one end of Massachusetts to the other, in which every\r\nRepublican newspaper in the State, so far as I know, united.\r\nThe Springfield _Republican_ and the Boston _Herald,_ as will\r\nwell be believed, were in glory.  The conduct of no pick-\r\npocket or bank robber could have been held up to public indignation\r\nand contempt in severer language than the supporters of that\r\nbill.  A classmate of mine, an eminent man of letters, a gentleman\r\nof great personal worth, addressed a young ladies' school,\r\nor some similar body in Western Massachusetts, on the subject\r\nof the decay of public virtue as exemplified by me.  He declared\r\nthat I had separated myself from the best elements in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe measure was passed over the President's veto.  But it\r\ncost the Republican Party its majority in the House of Representatives.\r\nA large number of the member of the House who had voted for\r\nit lost their seats.  If the question of my reelection had\r\ncome on within a few weeks thereafter, I doubt whether I should\r\nhave got forty votes in the whole Legislature.  If I had flinched\r\nor apologized, I should have been destroyed.  But I stood\r\nto my guns.  I wrote a letter to the people of Massachusetts\r\nin which I took up case by case each provision of the bill,\r\nand showed how important it was for the interest of commerce\r\nbetween the States, or with foreign countries, and how well\r\nit justified the moderate expenditure.  I pointed out that\r\nthe bill had been, in proportion to the resources of the Government,\r\nless in amount than those John Quincy Adams and Daniel Webster\r\nhad formerly advocated; that Mr. Webster, with the single\r\nexception of his service for preserving the Union, prided\r\nhimself on his support of this policy of public improvement\r\nmore than on anything else in his life, and had made more\r\nspeeches on that subject than on any other.  Mr. Adams claimed\r\nto be the author of the policy of internal improvements.  So\r\nthat it was a Massachusetts policy, and a Massachusetts doctrine.\r\nI asked the people of Massachusetts to consider whether they\r\ncould reasonably expect to get their living by manufacture,\r\nto which nearly the whole State was devoted, bringing their\r\nraw material and their fuel and their iron and coal and cotton\r\nand wool from across the continent, and then carrying the\r\nmanufactured article back again to be sold at the very places\r\nwhere the material came from, in competition with States like\r\nPennsylvania and New York and Ohio and Indiana, unless the\r\ncost of transportation was, so far as possible, annihilated.\r\n\r\nI concluded by saying that I knew they would not come to my\r\nway of thinking that afternoon or that week, but that they\r\nwere sure to come to it in the end.  With very few exceptions\r\nthe letter did not change the course of the newspapers, or\r\nof the leading men who had zealously committed themselves\r\nto another doctrine.  But it convinced the people, and I believe\r\nit had a very great effect throughout the country, and was\r\nthe means of saving the policy of internal improvements from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nMr. Clapp, of the Boston _Journal,_ with a manliness that\r\ndid him infinite credit, declared publicly in its columns that\r\nhe had been all wrong, and that I was right.  The Worcester\r\n_Spy,_ edited by my dear friend and near kinsman, Evarts\r\nGreene, had with the rest of the press attacked my vote.\r\nMr. Greene himself was absent at the time, so the paper was\r\nthen in charge of an associate.  When Mr. Greene returned\r\nI asked him to spend an afternoon at my house.  That was\r\nbefore my letter came out.  I had sent to Washington for\r\nall the engineers' reports and other documents showing the\r\nnecessity of every item of the bill.  Mr. Greene made a careful\r\nstudy of the bill and agreed with me.\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Herald_ also obtained all the material from Washington\r\nand sent it to a very able gentleman who, though not taking\r\nany part in the ordinary conduct of the _Herald,_ was called\r\nupon for services requiring special ability and investigation.\r\nThey asked him to answer my letter.  He spent five days in\r\nstudying the matter, and then wrote to the managing editor\r\nof the paper than Mr. Hoar was entirely right, and that he\r\nshould not write the article desired.  The _Herald,_ however,\r\ndid not abandon its position.  It kept up the war.  But I\r\nought to say it so far modified its action that it supported\r\nme for reelection the next winter.\r\n\r\nThe Springfield _Republican_ saw and seized its opportunity.\r\nIt attacked the River and Harbor Bill savagely.  It said:\r\n\"Mr. Hoar is a candidate for reelection and has dealt himself\r\na very severe blow.  The Commonwealth was prepared to honor\r\nMessrs. Crapo and Hoar anew.  To-day it pauses, frowns and\r\nreflects.\"  So it kept up the attack.  It had previously advocated\r\nthe selection of Mr. Crapo as candidate for Governor.  It\r\nbitterly denounced me.  Mr. Crapo had himself voted for the\r\nRiver and Harbor Bill.  It could not consistently maintain\r\nits bitter opposition to me, because of my vote, while supporting\r\nMr. Crapo.  So it declared it could no longer support him.\r\n\r\nWhen the State Convention came the feeling was still strong,\r\nthough somewhat abated.  I had been asked by the Committee,\r\na good while before, to preside at the Convention.  This I\r\ndid.  I was received rather coldly when I went forward.  But\r\nI made no apologies.  I began my speech by saying: \"It gives\r\nme great pleasure to meet this assembly of the representatives\r\nof the Republicans of Massachusetts.  I have seen these faces\r\nbefore.  They are faces into which I am neither afraid nor\r\nashamed to look.\"  The assembly hesitated a little between\r\nindignation at the tone of defiance, and approval of a man's\r\nstanding by his convictions.  The latter feeling predominated,\r\nand they broke out into applause.  But the resolutions which\r\nthe Committee reported contained a mild but veiled reproof\r\nof my action.\r\n\r\nMr. Crapo was defeated in the Convention.  I have no doubt\r\nhe would have been nominated for Governor, but for his vote\r\nfor the River and Harbor Bill.  His successful competitor,\r\nMr. Bishop, was a gentleman of great personal worth, highly\r\nesteemed throughout the Commonwealth, and of experience in\r\nState administration.  But it was thought that his nomination\r\nhad been secured by very active political management, concerted\r\nat the State House, and that the nomination did not fairly\r\nrepresent the desire of the people of the Commonwealth.  Whatever\r\ntruth there may have been in this, I am very sure that Mr.\r\nCrapo's defeat could not have been compassed but for his vote\r\nfor the River and Harbor Bill.  The result of the above feeling,\r\nhowever, was that the Republican campaign was conducted without\r\nmuch heart, and General Butler was elected Governor.\r\n\r\nWhen the election of Senator came in the following winter,\r\nI was opposed by what remained of the feeling against the\r\nRiver and Harbor Bill.  My principal Republican competitors\r\nwere Mr. Crapo, whose friends rightly thought he had been\r\ntreated with great injustice; and Governor Long, a great public\r\nfavorite, who had just ended a brilliant and most acceptable\r\nterm of service as Governor.  Governor Long had presided at\r\na public meeting where President Arthur had been received\r\nduring the summer, and had assured him that his action had\r\nthe hearty approval and support of the people of the Commonwealth.\r\nI had, of course, no right to find the least fault with the\r\nsupporters of Governor Long.  He would have been in every\r\nway a most acceptable and useful Senator.  I ought to say\r\nthat, as I understood it, he hardly assumed the attitude of\r\na candidate for the place, and declared in a public letter\r\nor speech that he thought I ought to be reelected.  So, after\r\na somewhat earnest struggle I was again chosen.\r\n\r\nOne curious incident happened during the election.  The morning\r\nafter the result was declared, a story appeared in the papers\r\nthat Mr. Crapo's supporters had been led to come over to me\r\nby the statement that one of them had received a telegram\r\nfrom him withdrawing his name, and advising that course.  The\r\ncorrespondent of one of the papers called upon Mr. Crapo,\r\nwho answered him that he had never sent any such telegram\r\nto Boston.  So it was alleged that somebody who favored me\r\nhad brought about the result by this false statement.  A newspaper\r\ncorrespondent called on me in Washington, and asked me about\r\nthe story.  I told him that I had not heard of the story, but\r\nthat if it turned out to be true I, of course, would instantly\r\ndecline the office.  A full investigation was made of the\r\nmatter, and it turned out that Mr. Crapo had sent such a\r\ntelegram to a member of the Legislature in New Bedford, who\r\nhad taken it to Boston and made it known.\r\n\r\nThe next winter, at my suggestion, a resolution was passed\r\ncalling upon the Secretary of War, Mr. Lincoln, to specify\r\nwhich items in the River and Harbor Bill of the previous winter\r\nwere not, in his opinion, advisable, or did not tend to promote\r\ninternational or interstate commerce.  He replied specifying\r\na very few items only, amounting altogether to a very few\r\nthousand dollars.  This reply was made by the Secretary of\r\nWar, as he told me in private afterward, by the express direction\r\nof the President, and after consultation with him.  That ended\r\nthe foolish outcry against the great policy of internal improvement,\r\nwhich has helped to make possible the marvels of our domestic\r\ncommerce, one of the most wonderful creations of human history.\r\nThe statistics of its vast extent, greater now, I think, than\r\nall the foreign commerce of the world put together, from the\r\nnature of the case, never can be precisely ascertained.  It\r\nis not only wonderful in its amount, but in its origin, its\r\nresources, and in its whole conduct.  All its instrumentalities\r\nare American.  It is American at both ends, and throughout\r\nall the way.  This last year a bill providing for an expenditure\r\nof sixty millions, nearly four times the amount of that which\r\nPresident Arthur, and the newspapers that supported him, thought\r\nso extravagant, passed Congress without a murmur of objection,\r\nand if I mistake not, without a dissenting vote.\r\n\r\nI should like to put on record one instance of the generosity\r\nand affection of Mr. Dawes.  He had not voted when his name\r\nwas called, expecting to vote at the end of the roll-call.\r\nHe meant to vote against the passage of the bill over the\r\nveto.  But when he heard my vote for it, he saw that I was\r\nbringing down on my head a storm of popular indignation,\r\nand made up his mind that he would not throw the weight of\r\nhis example on the side against me.  So, contrary to his opinion\r\nof the merits of the bill, he came to my side, and voted with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI suppose a good many moralists will think that it is a very\r\nwicked thing indeed for a man to vote against his convictions\r\non a grave public question, from a motive like this, of personal\r\nfriendship.  But I think on the whole I like better the people,\r\nwho will love Mr. Dawes for such an act, than those who will\r\ncondemn him.  I would not, probably, put what I am about to\r\nsay in an address to a Sunday-school, or into a sermon to\r\nthe inmates of a jail or house of correction.  I cannot, perhaps,\r\ndefend it by reason.  But somehow or other, I am strongly\r\ntempted to say there are occasions in life where the meanest\r\nthing a man can do is to do perfectly right.  But I do not\r\nsay it.  It would be better to say that there are occasions\r\nwhen the instinct is a better guide than the reason.  At any\r\nrate, I do not believe the recording angel made any trouble\r\nfor Mr. Dawes for that vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nCHINESE TREATY AND LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nMuch of what I have said in the preceding chapter is, in substance,\r\napplicable to my vote on another matter in which I had been\r\ncompelled to take an attitude in opposition to a large majority\r\nof my own party and to the temporary judgment of my countrymen:\r\nthat is the proposed legislation in violation of the Treaty\r\nwith China; the subsequent Treaty modifying that negotiated\r\nin 1868 by Mr. Seward on our part, and Mr. Burlingame for\r\nChina; and the laws which have been enacted since, upon the\r\nsubject of Chinese immigration.  I had the high honor of being\r\nhung in effigy in Nevada by reason of the report that I had\r\nopposed, in secret Session of the Senate, the Treaty of 1880.\r\nMy honored colleague, Mr. Dawes, and I were entirely agreed\r\nin the matter.  Mr. Dawes complained good-naturedly to Senator\r\nJones, of Nevada, that he had been neglected when the Nevada\r\npeople had singled me out for that sole honor, to which Mr.\r\nJones, with equal good-nature, replied that if Mr. Dawes\r\ndesired, he would have measures taken to correct the error,\r\nwhich had inadvertently been made.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the late Anson Burlingame, an old friend of mine\r\nand a man highly esteemed in Massachusetts, who had been\r\nsent to China as the American Minister in Mr. Lincoln's time,\r\nwas appointed by the Chinese Government its Ambassador, or\r\nEnvoy, to negotiate treaties with the United States and several\r\nEuropean powers.  He made a journey through this country and\r\nEurope, travelling with Oriental magnificence, in a state\r\nwhich he was well calculated to maintain and adorn.  It was\r\njust after we had put down the Rebellion, abolished slavery,\r\nand made of every slave a freeman and every freeman a citizen.\r\nThe hearts of the people were full of the great doctrines\r\nof liberty which Jefferson and the Fathers of our country\r\nhad learned from Milton and the statesmen of the English Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Treaty was concluded on the 28th of July, 1868,\r\nbetween Mr. Seward and Mr. Burlingame and his associate Plenipotentiaries\r\nChih-Kang and Sun Chia-Ku.  It contained the following clause:\r\n\r\n\"The United States of American and the Emperor of China cordially\r\nrecognize the inherent and inalienable right of man to change\r\nhis home and allegiance, and also the mutual advantage of\r\nfree migration and emigration of their citizens and subjects\r\nrespectively from one country to the other for purposes of\r\ncuriosity, of trade, or as permanent residents.\"\r\n\r\nArticle VII. of the same Treaty stipulated that citizens of\r\neach power should enjoy all the privileges of the public\r\neducational institutions under the control of the government of\r\nthe other, enjoyed by the citizens or the subjects of the most\r\nfavored nation, and that the citizens of each might, themselves,\r\nestablish schools in the others' country.  Congress passed\r\nan Act, July 27, 1868, to a like effect, to which the following\r\nis the preamble to the first section:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent\r\nright of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the\r\nrights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and\r\nwhereas in the recognition of this principle this government\r\nhas freely received emigrants from all nations, and invested\r\nthem with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is claimed\r\nthat such American citizens, with their descendants, are subjects\r\nof foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments thereof;\r\nand whereas it is necessary to the maintenance of public peace\r\nthat this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and\r\nfinally disavowed: Therefore,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThereafter, in the first term of the Administration of President\r\nHayes, in the December Session of 1878, a bill was introduced\r\nwhich, almost defiantly, as it seemed to me, violated the\r\nfaith of the country pledged by the Burlingame Treaty.  There\r\nhad been no attempt to induce China to modify that Treaty.\r\nI resisted its passage as well as I could.  But my objection\r\nhad little effect in the excited condition of public sentiment.\r\nThe people of the Pacific coast were, not unnaturally, excited\r\nand alarmed by the importation into their principal cities\r\nof Chinese laborers, fearing, I think without much reason,\r\nthat American laboring men could not maintain themselves in\r\nthe competition with this thrifty and industrious race who\r\nlived on food that no American could tolerate, and who had\r\nno families to support, and who crowded together, like sardines\r\nin a box, in close and unhealthy sleeping apartments.\r\n\r\nI supposed that the labor of this inferior class would raise the\r\ncondition of better and more intelligent laborers.  That,\r\nhowever, was a fairly disputable question.  But I could not\r\nconsent to striking at men, as I have just said, because of\r\ntheir occupation.  This bill was vetoed by President Hayes,\r\nwho put his objections solely upon the ground that the bill\r\nwas in violation of the terms of the existing Treaty.  The\r\nHouse, by a vote of 138 yeas to 116 nays, refused to pass\r\nthe bill over the veto.\r\n\r\nBut in 1880 a Treaty was negotiated, and approved by the Senate\r\nand ratified July 19, 1881, which relieved the United States\r\nfrom the provisions of the Burlingame Treaty, and permitted\r\nthe exclusion of Chinese laborers.  I made a very earnest\r\nspeech, during a debate on this Treaty in Executive Session\r\nof the Senate, in opposition to it.  The Senate did me the\r\nhonor, on the motion of Mr. Dawes, of a vote authorizing my\r\nspeech to be published, notwithstanding the rule of secrecy.\r\nBut one Senator from the Pacific coast complained, I think\r\nwith some reason, that I was permitted to publish my argument\r\non one side when he not only was not permitted to publish\r\nhis on the other, but his constituents had no means of knowing\r\nthat he had defended his views or made proper answer to mine.\r\nSo I thought it hardly fair to make by speech public, and\r\nit was not done.\r\n\r\nLater, in the spring of 1882, a bill was passed to carry\r\ninto effect the Treaty of 1880.  That I resisted as best I\r\ncould.  In opposition to this bill I made an earnest speech\r\nshowing it to be in conflict with the doctrines on which our\r\nfathers founded the Republic; with the principles of the\r\nConstitutions of nearly all the States, including that of\r\nCalifornia, and with the declarations of leading statesmen down\r\nto the year 1868.  I showed also that the Chinese race had\r\nshown examples of the highest qualities of manhood, of intelligence,\r\nprobity and industry.  I protested against a compact between\r\nthe two greatest nations of the Pacific, just as we were about\r\nto assert our great influence there, which should place in\r\nthe public law of the world, and in the jurisprudence of America,\r\nthe principle that it is fitting that there should be hereafter\r\na distinction in the treatment of men by governments and in\r\nthe recognition of their right to the pursuit of happiness\r\nby a peaceful change of their homes, based, not on conduct,\r\nnot on character, but upon race and occupation; by asserting\r\nthat you might justly deny to the Chinese what you might not\r\njustly deny to the Irish, that you might justly deny to the\r\nlaborer what you might not deny to the idler.  I pointed out\r\nthat this declaration was extorted from unwilling China by\r\nthe demand of America; and that laborers were henceforth to\r\nbe classed, in the enumeration of American public law, with\r\npaupers, lazzaroni, harlots, and persons afflicted with pestilential\r\ndiseases.  I ended what I had to say as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Humanity, capable of infinite depths of degradation, is also\r\ncapable of infinite heights of excellence.  The Chinese,\r\nlike all other races, has given us its examples of both.  To\r\nrescue humanity from this degradation is, we are taught to\r\nbelieve, the great object of God's moral government on earth.\r\nIt is not by injustice, exclusion, caste, but by reverence\r\nfor the individual soul that we can aid in this consummation.\r\nIt is not by Chinese policies that China is to be civilized.\r\nI believe that the immortal truths of the Declaration of Independence\r\ncame from the same source with the Golden Rule and the Sermon\r\non the Mount.  We can trust Him who promulgated these laws\r\nto keep the country safe that obeys them.  The laws of the\r\nuniverse have their own sanction.  They will not fail.  The\r\npower that causes the compass to point to the north, that\r\ndismisses the star on its pathway through the skies, promising\r\nthat in a thousand years it shall return again true to its\r\nhour and keeps His word, will vindicate His own moral law.\r\nAs surely as the path on which our fathers entered a hundred\r\nyears ago led to safety, to strength, to glory, so surely\r\nwill the path on which we now propose to enter bring us to\r\nshame, to weakness, and to peril.\"\r\n\r\nThe Statute then enacted, expired by its own limitations\r\ntwenty years afterward.  Meantime the prejudice against Chinese\r\nlabor had modified somewhat.  The public had become somewhat\r\nmore considerate of their rights and, at any rate, there was\r\na desire to maintain some show of decency in legislating the\r\nmatter.  So a more moderate Statute was enacted in 1902.  I\r\nwas the only person who voted against it in either House.\r\nIt was, of course, clear that resistance was useless.  It\r\nwas not worth while, it seemed to me, to undertake to express\r\nmy objections at length.  I contented myself with the following\r\nbrief remonstrance:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, I think this bill and this debate indicate\r\na great progress in sentiment.  The sentiment of the country\r\nhas passed, certainly so far as it is represented by a majority\r\nof the Senate, the stage, if it ever was in it, of a reckless\r\nseeking to accomplish the result of Chinese exclusion without\r\nregard to constitutional restraints, treaty obligations, or\r\nmoral duties.  There was in some quarters, as it seemed to\r\nme, in olden times, a disregard of all these restraints, certainly\r\nin the press, certainly in the harangues which were made to\r\nexcited crowds in various parts of the country.  Among others\r\nI can remember a visit of the apostle of Chinese exclusion\r\nto Boston Common which indicated that spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that has gone largely, and the Senate has discussed\r\nthis question with a temperate desire on the part of all classes\r\nand all Senators, whatever ways of thinking they have, to\r\ndo what seemed to them for the benefit of labor, the quality\r\nof the citizenship of this country, in a moderate and constitutional\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot agree with the principle on which this legislation\r\nor any legislation on the subject which we have had in the\r\ncountry since 1870 rests.  I feel bound to enter a protest.\r\nI believe that everything in the way of Chinese exclusion\r\ncan be accomplished by reasonable, practical and wise measures\r\nwhich will not involve the principle of striking at labor,\r\nand will not involve the principle of striking at any class\r\nof human beings merely because of race, without regard to\r\nthe personal and individual worth of the man struck at.  I\r\nhold that every human soul has its rights, dependent upon\r\nits individual personal worth and not dependent upon color\r\nor race, and that all races, all colors, all nationalities\r\ncontain persons entitled to be recognized everywhere they go\r\non the face of the earth as the equals of every other man.\"\r\n\r\nI do not think any man ever hated more than I have hated the\r\naffectation or the reality of singularity.  I know very well\r\nthat the American people mean to do right, and I believe with\r\nall my heart that the men and the party with whom I have acted\r\nfor fifty years mean to do right.  I believe the judgment\r\nof both far better than my own.  But every man's conscience\r\nis given to him as the lamp for his path.  He cannot walk\r\nby another light.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that the great political principles which\r\nhave been in issue for the last thirty years, have been, in\r\ngeneral, those that have been debated for centuries, and\r\nwhich cannot be settled by a single vote, in a legislative\r\nbody, by the result of a single election, or even by the opinion\r\nof a single generation.  In nearly every one of what I am\r\nsorry to say are the numerous instances where I have been\r\ncompelled to act upon my judgment against that of my own party,\r\nand even against that of the majority of my own countrymen,\r\nthe people have subsequently come around to my way of thinking,\r\nand in all of them, I believe, I have had on my side the opinion\r\nof the great men of the great generations of the past.  Certainly\r\nthe Chinese Exclusion Bill and the Chinese Treaty; the Spanish\r\nTreaty and the War against the Philippine people could not\r\nhave lived an hour before the indignation of the American\r\npeople at any time from the beginning down to the time when,\r\nin 1876, they celebrated the centennial of their Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nTHE WASHINGTON TREATY AND THE GENEVA AWARD\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Washington, creditable to all who engaged in\r\nit, not to be judged by its details, but by its great effect\r\nin securing peace to the world, saved Great Britain from a\r\nwar with us, in which it is not unlikely that the nations\r\nof Europe who hated her would have come to take part on our\r\nside.  But it saved us from the greater danger of having the\r\nwar spirit renewed and intensified by this gigantic struggle,\r\nfrom an international hatred which would not have cooled again\r\nfor a century; or, if we did not declare war, from taking\r\nthe ignoble attitude of a great and free people lying in wait\r\nfor an opportunity to revenge itself.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of that Treaty to remove every cause of\r\nquarrel.  One constant cause of quarrel, for many years,\r\nhad been the exercise of our right to fish on the shores\r\nof Newfoundland.  In the Treaty it was agreed that the United\r\nStates should have, in addition to her existing rights for\r\nten years, and for such further times as the parties should\r\nagree, the right to take fish on the sea coast of the British\r\nProvinces north of us, with permission to land for the purpose\r\nof drying nets and curing fish, and that we were to pay for\r\nthe privilege a sum to be fixed by arbitrators.  Two of these\r\narbitrators were to be appointed by the United States and\r\nGreat Britain; the other, who would serve as umpire, to be\r\nagreed upon by the two powers, or, if not agreed upon within\r\na certain time, then to be appointed by the Emperor of Austria.\r\nGreat Britain insisted upon having the Belgian Minister to\r\nthe United States for the third arbitrator, and refused to\r\nname or suggest or agree to any other person.  So the time\r\nexpired.  Thereupon the Belgian Minister, Mr. Delfosse, was\r\nselected by the Emperor of Austria.  Mr. Delfosse's own fortune\r\nin public life depended upon his Sovereign's favor.  We had\r\nalready notified Great Britain that, if the Belgian Minister\r\nwere selected, he would probably deem himself disqualified\r\nby reason of the peculiar connection of his Government with\r\nthat of Great Britain.  When the Treaty was negotiated, Earl\r\nde Grey, Chairman of the Commissioners, said, speaking of\r\nthe Government to whom the matter might be referred: \"I do\r\nnot name Belgium, because Great Britain has treaty arrangements\r\nwith that Government which might be supposed to incapacitate\r\nit.\"  Belgium, as was notorious, was dependent upon Great\r\nBritain to maintain its political existence against the ambitions\r\nof France and Germany.  Mr. Delfosse's sovereign was the\r\nson of the brother of Queen Victoria's mother and Prince Albert's\r\nfather, and was, himself, brother of Carlotta, wife of Maximilian,\r\nwhom we had lately compelled France to abandon to his fate.\r\n\r\nThe referee awarded that we should make a payment to Great\r\nBritain for this fishery privilege of five million five hundred\r\nthousand dollars.  We never valued them at all.  We abandoned\r\nthem at the end of ten years.  It would have been much better\r\nto leave the matter to Great Britain herself.  If she had\r\nbeen put upon honor she would not have made such an award.\r\nNo English Judge who valued his reputation would have suggested\r\nsuch a thing, as it seemed to us.\r\n\r\nI would rather the United States should occupy the position\r\nof paying that award, after calling the attention of England\r\nto its injustice and wrong, than to occupy the position of\r\nEngland when she pocketed the money.  A war with England would\r\nhave been a grievous thing to her workingmen who stood by\r\nus in our hour of peril, and to all that class of Englishmen\r\nwhom we loved, and who loved us.  Such a war would have been\r\na war between the only two great English-speaking nations\r\nof the world, and the two nations whose policy, under methods\r\nlargely similar, though somewhat different, were determined\r\nby the public opinion of their people.\r\n\r\nIf however our closer and friendlier relations with England\r\nare to result in our adopting her social manners, her deference\r\nto rank and wealth, and of adopting her ideas of empire and\r\nthe method of treating small and weak nations by great and\r\nstrong ones, it would be better that we had kept aloof, and\r\nthat the old jealousy and dislike engendered by two wars had\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nA very interesting question was settled during the Administration\r\nof President Hayes as to the disposition of the $15,500,000\r\nrecovered from Great Britain by the award of the tribunal\r\nof Geneva for the violation of the obligations of neutrality\r\nduring the Civil War.  Great Britain, after what we had claimed\r\nwhat was full notice of what was going on, permitted certain\r\nwar vessels to be constructed in England for the Confederate\r\nGovernment.  She permitted those vessels to leave her ports\r\nand, by a preconcerted arrangement, to receive their armament,\r\nalso procured in Great Britain.  She turned a deaf, an almost\r\ncontemptuous ear, to the remonstrances of Mr. Adams, our\r\nMinister.  The Foreign Office, after a while, informed him\r\nthat they did not wish to receive any more representations\r\non that subject.  But, as the War went on and the naval and\r\nmilitary strength of the United States increased and became\r\nmore manifest, Great Britain became more careful.  At last\r\nsome Rebel rams were built by the Lairds, ship-builders of\r\nLiverpool.  Mr. Adams procured what he deemed sufficient\r\nevidence that they were intended for the Confederate service,\r\nand made a demand on Lord Russell, the British Foreign Minister,\r\nthat they be detained.  To this Lord Russell replied that\r\nhe had submitted the matter to the Law officers of her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, and they could see no reason for interfering.\r\nTo this Mr. Adams instantly replied that he received the communication\r\nwith great regret, adding, \"It would be superfluous in me\r\nto point out to your Lordship that this is war.\" Lord Russell\r\nhastily reconsidered his opinion, and ordered the rams to\r\nbe stopped.\r\n\r\nHe afterward, as appears in his biography by Spencer Walpole,\r\nadmitted his error in not interfering in the case of the vessels\r\nthat had gone out before.  But the mischief was done.  The\r\nterror of these Confederate vessels had driven our commerce\r\nfrom the sea, or had compelled our merchant vessels to sail\r\nunder foreign flags, and had enormously increased the rate\r\nof insurance to those who kept the sea under our flag.\r\n\r\nAfter the War had ended a demand for compensation was earnestly\r\npressed upon Great Britain.  A demand was made to refer the\r\nclaims to arbitration, and a Treaty negotiated for that purpose\r\nby Reverdy Johnson under Andrew Johnson's Administration,\r\nwas rejected by the Senate, on the ground, among other reasons,\r\nthat the element of chance entered into the result.\r\n\r\nThereafter, in General Grant's time, a Joint High Commission\r\nto deal with this controversy was agreed upon between the\r\ntwo countries, which sat in Washington, in 1871.  The Commissioners\r\nin behalf of the United States were Hamilton Fish, Secretary\r\nof State; Robert C. Schenck, then our Minister to England;\r\nSamuel Nelson, Judge of the Supreme Court; Ebenezer Rockwood\r\nHoar, lately Attorney-General, and George H. Williams, afterward\r\nAttorney-General.  On behalf of Great Britain there were Earl\r\nde Grey and Ripon, afterward Marquis of Ripon; Sir Stafford\r\nH. Northcote, afterward Earl of Idesleigh; Edward Thornton,\r\nthen the British Minister here; John A. MacDonald, Premier\r\nof Canada, and Montague Bernard, Professor of International\r\nLaw at Oxford.  The two countries could not, in all probability,\r\nhave furnished men more competent for such a purpose.  They\r\nagreed upon a treaty.  The rules by which neutral governments\r\nwere to be held to be bound for the purposes of the arbitration\r\nwere agreed on beforehand in the Treaty itself.  They agreed\r\nto observe these rules between themselves in the future, and\r\nto invite other maritime powers to accede to them.  The Treaty\r\nalso contained a statement that Her Britannic Majesty had\r\n\"authorized her High Commissioners and Plenipotentiaries to\r\nexpress in a friendly spirit the regret felt by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment for the escape, under whatever circumstances,\r\nof the Alabama and other vessels from British ports, and\r\nfor the depredations committed by those vessels.\"  I am not\r\naware a like apology has ever been made by Great Britain during\r\nher history, to any other country.  There was a provision\r\nalso, for the reference of some other matters in dispute between\r\nthe two countries.  One of these related to the fisheries--\r\na source of irritation between this country and the British\r\npossessions north of us ever since the Revolution.\r\n\r\nI will not undertake to tell that part of the story here.\r\nIt was agreed to submit the questions of the claims growing\r\nout of the escape of the Rebel cruisers to a tribunal which\r\nwas to sit at Geneva.  Of this, one member was to be appointed\r\nby each of the parties, and the others by certain designated\r\nforeign governments.  Our Commissioner was Charles Francis\r\nAdams, who had borne himself so wisely and patiently during\r\nthe period of the Civil War.  The English Commissioner was\r\nSir Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Justice of England.  The\r\nUnited States was represented by Caleb Cushing, William M.\r\nEvarts and Morrison R. Waite, afterward Chief Justice of\r\nthe United States, as counsel.\r\n\r\nAdams rarely betrayed any deep emotion on any public occasion,\r\nhowever momentous.  But it must have been hard for him to\r\nconceal the thrill of triumph, after the ignominy to which\r\nhe had submitted during that long and anxious time, when he\r\nheard the tribunal pronounce its judgment, condemning Great\r\nBritain to pay $15,500,000 damages for the wrong-doing against\r\nwhich he had so earnestly and vainly protested.  Perhaps the\r\nfeeling of his grandfather when he signed the Treaty of Independence\r\nin 1783 might alone be compared to it.  Yet his father, John\r\nQuincy Adams, had something of the same feeling when, at the\r\nclose of a war which put an end forever to the impressment\r\nof American seamen, and made the sailor in his ship as safe\r\nas the farmer in his dwelling, he signed the Treaty which\r\nsecured our boundary and our fisheries as they had been secured\r\nby his father.*  John Quincy Adams had struck, by the direction\r\nof his father, in 1815, a seal which he gave to his son, with\r\nthe injunction to give it to his, bearing the motto, \"Piscemur,\r\nvenemur, ut olim,\"--We keep our hunting grounds and our fishing\r\ngrounds as of old.  I doubt if three such achievements, by\r\nthree successive generations, can be found in the annals of\r\nany other family however illustrious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* This story is told more fully at page 147.  It seems appropriate\r\nin both places.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nThe $15,500,000 was promptly paid.  Then came the question\r\nwhat to do with it.  There was no doubt anywhere, that the\r\nowners of vessels or cargoes that had been captured or destroyed\r\nby the cruisers for whose departure from British ports Great\r\nBritain was in fault, were entitled to be paid.  That, however,\r\nwould not consume the fund.  The fund had been paid in gold\r\ncoin by Great Britain, September 9, 1873, and had been covered\r\ninto the Treasury the same day.  This sum was invested in\r\na registered bond for the amount, of the five per cent. loan\r\nof 1881, dated September 10, 1873, inscribed, \"Hamilton Fish,\r\nSecretary of State, in trust.  To be held subject to the future\r\ndisposition of Congress, etc.\" This sum largely exceeded what\r\nwas necessary to make good the principal of all losses directly\r\nresulting from the damages caused by the insurgent cruisers,\r\nabove what had already been reimbursed from insurance.  These\r\nclaims were popularly termed the \"claims for direct damages.\"\r\n\r\nThe question what to do with the balance was the subject\r\nof great dispute throughout the country, and of much debate\r\nin both Houses of Congress.  Some persons claimed that the\r\nowners directly damaged should receive interest.  That would\r\nstill leave a large part of the fund undisposed of.  It was\r\ninsisted that the remainder belonged to the Government for\r\nthe benefit of the whole people who had borne the burden and\r\ncost of the war.  Others claimed that, as nothing but direct\r\ndamages were lawfully assessable, the balance should be paid\r\nback to Great Britain.  Still others claimed that the persons\r\nwho had suffered indirectly by the loss of voyages, the increased\r\nrates of insurance, and the breaking up of business, were\r\njustly entitled to the money.  Still others, perhaps the most\r\nformidable and persistent of all, claimed that the underwriters\r\nwho had paid insurance on vessels or cargoes destroyed, were\r\nentitled to the money on the familiar principle that an insurer\r\nwho pays a loss is subrogated to all the legal and equitable\r\nclaims of the party insured.\r\n\r\nThese disputes prevented any disposition of the fund by Congress\r\nuntil the summer of 1874.\r\n\r\nJudge Hoar, who was then a Member of the House of Representatives,\r\nsuggested that as everybody agreed that the claims for direct\r\ndamage ought to be paid, that it was not fair that they should\r\nbe kept waiting longer in order to settle the dispute about\r\nthe rest of the fund.  In accordance with his suggestion a\r\nCourt was provided for by Act of Congress, whose duty it was\r\nto receive and examine all claims directly resulting from\r\ndamages caused by the insurgent cruisers.  They were directed,\r\nhowever, not to allow any claim where the party injured had\r\nreceived indemnity from any insurance company, except to the\r\nexcess of such claim above the indemnity.  They were further\r\nauthorized to allow interest at the rate of four per cent.\r\nThe Court performed its duty.  When its judgments had been\r\npaid there still remained a large balance.  The ablest lawyers\r\nin the Senate, in general, pressed the claim of the insurance\r\ncompanies to the balance of the fund, including Mr. Edmunds,\r\nJudge Davis, Judge Thurman and Mr. Bayard.  I took up the\r\nquestion with a strong leaning for the insurance companies.\r\nI was, of course, impressed by the well-known principle of\r\nlaw that the underwriter who had paid for property destroyed\r\nby the cause against which he had insured, was entitled to\r\nbe substituted to all other rights or remedies which the owner\r\nmay have for reimbursement of his loss.  I was very much impressed\r\nalso in favor of the insurance companies, who were making\r\nwhat they doubtless believed an honest and just claim, fortified\r\nby many of the best legal opinions in Congress and out of\r\nit, by the character of the attacks made on them, especially\r\nby General Butler.  These attacks appealed to the lowest passions\r\nand prejudices.  It was said that the companies were rich;\r\nthat they made their money out of the misfortunes of their\r\ncountrymen; that they were trying to get up to their arm-pits in\r\nthe National Treasury, and that they employed famous counsel.\r\nIf there be anything likely to induce a man with legal or\r\njudicial instincts to set his teeth against a proposition,\r\nit is that style of argument.\r\n\r\nBut I came to the conclusion, both from the history of the\r\nproceedings at Geneva, and from the nature of the submission,\r\nthat the claim that had been established against Great Britain\r\nwas a National claim, made by National authority for a National\r\ninjury.  That this was the character of the claim our counsel\r\ngave express notice to Great Britain and to the tribunal.\r\nThis opinion was asserted by Mr. Fish in his instructions\r\nto the counsel.  When the Government of the United States\r\nreceived it, it seemed to me that it was entitled to apply\r\nit in its high discretion; and to give it to such persons\r\nentitled to its protection or consideration as it should see\r\nfit.  I made a careful argument in support of this view.  I\r\nthought, accordingly, that the balance of the fund, after\r\ncompensating all persons, not yet paid, for claims directly\r\nresulting from damage done on the high seas by Confederate\r\ncruisers, and the class of insurance companies above mentioned,\r\nshould be paid to persons who had paid premiums for war risks\r\nafter the sailing of any Confederate cruiser.  I maintained\r\nthis doctrine as well as I could against the powerful arguments\r\nI have named.  There were other very strong arguments on the\r\nsame side, and I had the gratification of being assured by\r\nseveral Senators that my presentation of the case had convinced\r\nthem.  Mr. Blaine, who had, himself, earnestly engaged in\r\nthe debate, said that he thought that the opinion of the majority\r\nof the Senators had been changed by my argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S POWER OF REMOVAL\r\n\r\nThe two most important questions of the construction of the\r\nConstitution which came up in our early history have been\r\nfinally put at rest in our day.  I have had something to do\r\nwith disposing of both of them.  With the disposition of one\r\nof them I had a leading part.\r\n\r\nThe first of these questions was whether in executing the\r\npowers conferred upon it by the Constitution, Congress must\r\nconfine itself to such means and instrumentalities as are\r\nstrictly and indispensably necessary to their accomplishment;\r\nor whether it might select, among the measures which fairly\r\npromote such Constitutional ends, any method which it shall\r\nthink for the public interest, exercising this power in a\r\nliberal way, and remembering in doing so that it is a Constitution--\r\nthe vital power of a free people,--we are defining and limiting,\r\nand not an ordinary power of attorney.\r\n\r\nThis question first came up in Washington's Administration,\r\non the bill for establishing a National Bank.  Seldom any\r\ndoubt is raised now as to the Constitutional power of the\r\nNational Government to accomplish and secure any of the great\r\nresults which we could not secure before the war, by reason\r\nof what is called the doctrine of State Rights.  Democrat\r\nand Republican, men of the South and men of the North, now\r\nagree in exercising without a scruple the power of Congress\r\nto protect American interests by the tariff, to endow and\r\nto subsidize railroads across the continent, and to build\r\nan Oceanic canal.\r\n\r\nI have in my possession, in Roger Sherman's and James Madison's\r\nhandwriting, a paper which contains the first statement of\r\na controversy which divided parties and sections, which inspired\r\nNullification, and which entered largely in the strife which\r\nbrought on the Civil War.\r\n\r\n(In Roger Sherman's handwriting.) \"You will admit that Congress\r\nhave power to provide by law for raising, depositing and applying\r\nmoney for the purposes enumerated in the Constitution.\" X\r\n(and generally of regulating the finances).  \"That they have\r\npower so far as no particular rules are pointed out in the\r\nConstitution to make such rules and regulations as they may\r\njudge necessary and proper to effect these purposes.  The\r\nonly question that remains is--Is a bank (a necessary and)\r\na proper measure for effecting these purposes? And is not\r\nthis a question of expediency rather than of right?\"\r\n\r\n(The following, on the same slip of paper, is in James Madison's\r\nhandwriting.) \"Feb. 4, 1791.  This handed to J. M. by Mr.\r\nSherman during the debate on the constitutionality of the\r\nbill for a National bank.  The line marked X given up by him\r\non the objection of J. M.  The interlineation of 'a necessary\r\n&' by J. M. to which he gave no other answer than a smile.\"\r\n\r\nThe other matter relates to the power of removal from office.\r\nUpon that the Constitution is silent.  In the beginning two\r\nviews were advocated.  There was a great debate in 1789, which\r\nMr. Evarts declares, \"decidedly the most important and best\r\nconsidered debate in the history of Congress.\" The claim that\r\nthe power of removal is vested absolutely in the President\r\nby the Constitution prevailed in the House of Representatives,\r\nunder the lead of Madison, by a majority of twelve, and by\r\nthe casting vote of John Adams in the Senate.  Mr. Madison\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The decision that is at this time made will become the permanent\r\nexposition of the Constitution; and on a permanent exposition\r\nof the Constitution will depend the genius and character of\r\nthe whole Government.\"\r\n\r\nOne party claimed that the power of removal was a necessary\r\nincident to the power of appointment, and vested in the President\r\nby virtue of his power to appoint.  It was claimed also on\r\nthe same side that the President's duty to see the laws faithfully\r\nexecuted could not be discharged if subordinates could be\r\nkept in office against his will.  In most cases the President\r\nnever executes the laws himself, but only has to see them\r\nexecuted faithfully.\r\n\r\nThis view prevailed, as we have seen, in Washington's Administration.\r\nIt continued to be acted upon till the time of President Johnson.\r\nIn General Jackson's time its soundness was challenged by\r\nWebster, Calhoun and Clay.  But there was no attempt to resist\r\nit in practice.  Mr. Webster in 1835 earnestly dissented\r\nfrom the original decision, while he admitted that he considered\r\nit \"a settled point; settled by construction, settled by precedent,\r\nsettled by the practice of the Government, and settled by\r\nstatute.\"  It remained so settled, until, in the strife which\r\nfollowed the rebellion, a two-thirds majority in Congress\r\nwas induced by apprehension of a grave public danger to attempt\r\nto wrest this portion of the executive power from the hands\r\nof Andrew Johnson.  The statute of March 2, 1867, as construed\r\nby nearly two-thirds of the Senate, enacted that officers\r\nappointed by the predecessor of President Johnson, who, by\r\nthe law in force when they were appointed, and by the express\r\nterms of their commission, were removable at the pleasure\r\nof the President, should remain in office until the Senate\r\nshould consent to the appointment of their successors, or\r\napprove their removal.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Congress undertook to determine by statute the construction\r\nof the Constitution as to this disputed question.  Some persons\r\nclaimed that that power existed in the provision--\"To make\r\nall laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\ninto execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\nvested by this Constitution in the Government of the United\r\nStates, or in any Department officer thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitutionality and effect of this statute were debated\r\non the trial of President Johnson.  But it served its purpose\r\nduring the last two years of Johnson's Administration.  Five\r\ndays after Grant's inauguration, the House of Representatives,\r\nby a vote of 138 to 16, passed a bill totally repealing it.\r\nThe Senate was unwilling to let go the hold which it had acquired\r\non the Executive power, but proposed to suspend the law for\r\none year, so that there might be no obstacle in the path of\r\nGeneral Grant to the removal of the obnoxious officials who\r\nhad adhered to Andrew Johnson.  So a compromise was agreed\r\nupon.  It permitted the President to suspend officers during\r\nthe vacation of the Senate, but restored officers so suspended\r\nat the close of the next session, unless, in the meantime,\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate had been obtained to\r\na removal or the appointment of a successor.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant, in his message of December, 1869, urged\r\nthe repeal of this modified act on the ground that--\r\n\r\n\"It could not have been the intention of the framers of the\r\nConstitution that the Senate should have the power to retain\r\nin office persons placed there by Federal appointment, against\r\nthe will of the President.  The law is inconsistent with a\r\nfaithful and efficient administration of the Government.  What\r\nfaith can an Executive put in officials forced on him, and\r\nthose, too, whom he has suspended for reason? How will such\r\nofficials be likely to serve an Administration which they\r\nknow does not trust them?\"\r\n\r\nThe House acted on this recommendation, and passed a bill\r\nfor the repeal of the statutes of 1867 and 1869 by a vote\r\nof 159 to 25.  For this bill the whole Massachusetts delegation,\r\nincluding Mr. Dawes and myself, voted.  It was never acted\r\non in the Senate.  In 1872 a similar bill passed the House\r\nwithout a division.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Party has invariably supported the position\r\nof Madison and Jackson, that the power of removal is vested\r\nby the Constitution in the President, and cannot be controlled\r\nby legislation.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of matters when Mr. Cleveland came\r\ninto office March 4, 1885.  The Revised Statutes, Sections\r\n1767-1772, contained in substance the law as it was left by\r\nthe legislation of 1867 and 1869 (Sec. 1767): \"Every person\r\nholding any civil office to which he has been or hereafter\r\nmay be appointed by and with the consent of the Senate, and\r\nwho shall have become duly qualified to act therein, shall\r\nbe entitled to hold such office during the term for which\r\nhe was appointed, unless sooner removed by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate, or by the appointment, with the\r\nlike advice and consent, of a successor, in his place, except\r\nas herein otherwise provided.\"\r\n\r\nThe President was however authorized to suspend civil officers\r\nduring the recess, except Judges, until the next session of\r\nthe Senate, and to designate a substitute who should discharge\r\nthe duties of the office, himself being subject to removal\r\nby the designation of another.\r\n\r\nThe President was further required to nominate within thirty\r\ndays after the commencement of each session of the Senate\r\npersons to fill all vacancies in office, which existed at\r\nthe meeting of the Senate, whether temporarily filled or not,\r\nand in place of all officers suspended.  If no appointment\r\nwere made, with the advice and consent of the Senate during\r\nsuch session, the office was to be in abeyance.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this statute required the assent of the\r\nSenate to the exercise of the President's power of removal,\r\nalthough without its consent he could suspend the officer so\r\nas to deprive him of the emoluments of his office.\r\n\r\nSo the appointment of a new officer by the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate operated in such case as a removal of the person\r\nthem holding office, and a failure of the Senate to confirm\r\nsuch proposed appointment had the effect to restore the officer\r\nsuspended, or temporarily removed.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions there grew up a very earnest controversy\r\nbetween President Cleveland and the Republican majority in\r\nthe Senate, led by the Judiciary Committee, of which Mr. Edmunds\r\nwas then Chairman.  It has been, I suppose from the beginning\r\nof the Government, the practice of the President to furnish\r\nto the Senate all papers and documents in his possession relating\r\nto the fitness of officials nominated to the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland made no objection, if I understood him correctly,\r\nto continuing that practice.  But he claimed that the Senate\r\nhad nothing to do with the exercise of his power of removal,\r\nand therefore was not entitled to be informed of the evidence\r\nupon which he acted in that.  So he refused and sustained\r\nthe heads of Departments in refusing the request of the Senate\r\nto send for its information the documents on file relating\r\nto removals.\r\n\r\nThis position was encountered by the Republican majority,\r\nsome of them claiming that the Senate had the same rightful\r\nshare in the removals as in appointments, and that no difference\r\nwas to be made between the two cases.  Others believed, as\r\nI did, that although the power of removal might be exercised\r\nby the President alone on his own responsibility, without\r\nrequiring the advice and consent of the Senate, still that\r\nwhile the President was proceeding under the law by which\r\nthe appointment itself operated as a removal, and a failure\r\nto affirm the appointment restored the old officer to his\r\nplace again, that the Senate whose action was to have that\r\nimportant effect, was entitled not only to know whether the\r\npublic interest would be served by the appointment of the\r\nproposed official on his own merits solely, but also whether\r\nit would be best served by the removal of his predecessor\r\nor by the restoration to office of his predecessor.  Both\r\nthe President and the Senate were acting under the existing\r\nlaw, treating it as in force and valid.  Now suppose it were\r\ntrue that the question of advising and consenting to the appointment\r\nproposed by the President were a very doubtful one indeed,\r\nthe question on its merits being closely balanced; and the\r\nofficer to be removed or restored according as the Senate\r\nshould consent or refuse to consent, was a man of conspicuous\r\nand unquestioned capacity and character, against whom no reasonable\r\nobjection was brought, to be removed for political reasons\r\nsolely.  The Senate certainly, in exercising its power had\r\nthe right to consider all that the President had a right to\r\nconsider, and therefore it seems to me that we were justified,\r\nin that class of cases, in asking for the documents in his\r\npossession bearing upon the question of removal.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in none of the arguments of this\r\nConstitutional question has it been claimed that the President\r\nhad the right without statute authority to suspend public\r\nofficers, even if he had the right to remove them.  That right,\r\nif he had it at all, he got under the statute under which\r\nhe and the Senate were acting.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of July, 1885, the President issued an order\r\nsuspending George M. Duskin of Alabama, from the office of\r\nAttorney of the United States, by virtue of the authority\r\nconferred upon him by Sec. 1768 of the Revised Statutes,\r\nwhich is a reenactment of the law of which I have just spoken.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of December, 1885, the President nominated to\r\nthe Senate John D. Burnett, vice George M. Duskin, suspended.\r\nThe Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, as had been\r\nusual in such cases, addressed a note to the Attorney-General,\r\nasking that all papers and information in the possession of\r\nthe Department touching the conduct and administration of\r\nthe officer proposed to be removed, and touching the character\r\nand conduct of the person proposed to be appointed, be sent\r\nto the Committee for its information.  To this the Attorney-\r\nGeneral replied that he was directed by the President to say\r\nthat there been sent already to the Judiciary Committee all\r\npapers in the Department relating to the fitness of John D.\r\nBurnett, recently nominated, but that it was not considered\r\nthat the public interests would be promoted by a compliance\r\nwith said resolution and the transmission of the papers and\r\ndocument therein mentioned to the Senate in Executive session.\r\n\r\nThat made a direct issue.  Thereupon a very powerful report\r\naffirming the right of the Senate to require such papers was\r\nprepared by Mr. Edmunds, Chairman of the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary, and signed by George F. Edmunds, Chairman, John\r\nJ. Ingalls, S. J. R. McMillan, George F. Hoar, James F. Wilson\r\nand William M. Evarts.\r\n\r\nThis was accompanied by a dissenting report by the minority\r\nof the Committee, signed by James L. Pugh, Richard Coke, George\r\nC. Vest and Howell E. Jackson, afterward Associate Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nSo it will be seen that the two sides were very powerfully\r\nrepresented.  The report of the Committee was encountered\r\nby a message from President Cleveland, dated March 1, 1886,\r\nin which the President claimed that these papers in the Attorney-\r\nGeneral's Department were in no sense upon its files, but\r\nwere deposited there for his convenience.  He said: \"I suppose\r\nif I desired to take them into my custody I might do so with\r\nentire propriety, and if I saw fit to destroy them no one\r\ncould complain.\"  Continuing, the President says that the\r\ndemands of the Senate \"assume the right to sit in judgment\r\nupon the exercise of my exclusive discretion and Executive\r\nfunction, for which I am solely responsible to the people\r\nfrom whom I have so lately received the sacred trust of office.\"\r\n\r\nHe refers to the laws upon which the Senate based its demand\r\nand said:  \"After an existence of nearly twenty years of almost\r\ninnocuous desuetude these laws are brought forth--apparently\r\nthe repealed as well as the unrepealed--and put in the way\r\nof an Executive who is willing, if permitted, to attempt an\r\nimprovement in the methods of administration.  The Constitutionality\r\nof these laws is by no means admitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe President seemed to forget that he had taken action under\r\nthose laws, and had expressly cited them as the authority\r\nfor his action, in his message announcing the suspension of\r\nthe official.\r\n\r\nThe controversy waxed warm in the Senate, and in the press\r\nthroughout the country.  The effect of it was that the confirmation\r\nof Mr. Cleveland's nominees for important offices was postponed\r\nfor several months, in some cases eight to ten, but as they\r\nwere exercising their functions under temporary appointments,\r\nit made no difference to them.  When they were at last confirmed\r\nby the Senate, they received commissions dated from the appointment\r\nwhich took place after the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\nSo the four years, for which they could hold office, began\r\nto run then, and when a new Administration of a different\r\npolitics came into power, they held their office for a period\r\nconsiderably more than four years, except a few who were\r\nactually removed by President Harrison.\r\n\r\nI do not think the people cared much about the dispute.  The\r\nsympathy was rather with President Cleveland.  The people,\r\nboth Republicans and Democrats, expected that the political\r\ncontrol of the more important offices would be changed when\r\na new party came into power, and considered Mr. Edmunds's\r\nConstitutional argument as a mere ingenious device to protract\r\nthe day when their political fate should overtake the Republican\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nI united with the majority of the Committee in the report,\r\nfor the reasons I have stated above.  I still think the position\r\nof the Senate right, and that of the President wrong.  But\r\nI never agreed to the claim that the Senate had anything to\r\ndo with the President's power of removal.  So I took the first\r\nopportunity to introduce a bill repealing the provisions of\r\nthe statute relating to the tenure of office, which interfered\r\nwith the President's power of removal, so that we might go\r\nback again to the law which had been in force from the foundation\r\nof the Government, in the controversy with President Jackson.\r\nA majority of the Republicans had attempted to do that, as\r\nI have said, in the first session of Congress under President\r\nGrant.  But it had been defeated by the Senate.  So I introduced\r\nin the December session, 1886, a bill which became a law March\r\n3, 1887, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Be enacted, etc., That sections 1767, 1768, 1769, 1770,\r\n1771, and 1772 of the Revised Statutes of the United States\r\nare hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  This repeal shall not affect any officer heretofore\r\nsuspended under the provisions of said sections, or any designation,\r\nnomination or appointment heretofore made by virtue of the\r\nprovisions thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Approved, March 3, 1887.\"\r\n\r\nBut the blood of my Republican associates was up.  I got\r\na few Republican votes for my Bill.  It passed the House\r\nby a vote of 172 to 67.  Every Massachusetts Representative\r\nvoted for the Bill, as did Speaker Reed.  But in general\r\nthe votes against it were Republican votes.  Governor Long\r\nmade an able speech in its favor.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate three Republicans only voted with me.  Among\r\nthe nays were several Senators who, as members of the House,\r\nhad voted for a Bill involving the same principle in 1869.\r\nMr. Evarts, though absent at the time of this vote, declared\r\nhis approval of the Bill in debate; and so, I think, did Mr.\r\nDawes, although of that I am not sure.  Mr. Edmunds opposed\r\nit with all his might and main.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman, always a good friend of mine, remonstrated with\r\nme.  He asked me with great seriousness, if I was conscious\r\nof the extent of the feeling among the Republicans of the\r\nSenate at my undertaking to act in opposition to them on\r\nthis and one or two other important matters, to which he\r\nalluded.  I replied that I must of course do what seemed to\r\nbe my duty, and that in my opinion I was rendering a great\r\nservice to the Republican Party in getting rid of the controversy\r\nin which the people sympathized generally with the Democrats,\r\nand that I thought the gentlemen who differed from me, would\r\ncome to my way of thinking pretty soon.  The result proved\r\nthe soundness of my judgment.  I do not think a man can be\r\nfound in the Senate now who would wish to go back to the law\r\nwhich was passed to put fetters on the limbs of Andrew Johnson.\r\nI have asked several gentlemen who voted against the repeal\r\nwhether they did not think so, and they all now agree that\r\nthe measure was eminently wise and right.  The opposition\r\nto the statute of 1887 was but the dying embers of the old\r\nfires of the Johnson controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nFISHERIES\r\n\r\nIf, on looking back, I were to select the things which I\r\nhave done in public life in which I take the most satisfaction,\r\nthey would be, the speech in the Senate on the Fisheries\r\nTreaty, July 10, 1886, the letter denouncing the A. P. A., a\r\nsecret, political association, organized for the purpose of\r\nostracizing our Catholic fellow-citizens, and the numerous\r\nspeeches, letters and magazine articles against the subjugation\r\nof the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nI do not think any one argument, certainly that my argument,\r\ncaused the defeat of the Fisheries Treaty, negotiated by Mr.\r\nJoseph Chamberlain and Mr. Bayard during Mr. Cleveland's\r\nfirst Administration.  The argument against it was too strong\r\nnot to have prevailed without any one man's contribution to\r\nit; and the Senate was not so strongly inclined to support\r\nPresident Cleveland as to give a two-thirds majority to a\r\nmeasure, unless it seemed clearly for the public interest.\r\nHe had his Republican opponents to reckon with, and the Democrats\r\nin the Senate disliked him very much, and gave him a feeble\r\nand half-hearted support.\r\n\r\nThe question of our New England fisheries has interested\r\nthe people of the country, especially of New England, from\r\nour very early history.  Burke spoke of them before the Revolutionary\r\nWar, as exciting even then the envy of England.  One of the\r\nbest known and most eloquent passages in all literature is\r\nhis description of the enterprise of our fathers.  Burke adds\r\nto that description:\r\n\r\n\"When I reflect upon the effects, when I see how profitable\r\nthey have been to us, I feel all the pride of power sink,\r\nand all presumption in the wisdom of human contrivances melt\r\nand die away within me.  My rigor relents.  I pardon something\r\nto the spirit of Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe War of the Revolution, of course, interrupted for a time\r\nthe fisheries of the American colonies.  But the fishermen\r\nwere not idle.  They manned the little Navy whose exploits\r\nhave never yet received from history its due meed of praise.\r\nThey furnished the ships' companies of Manly and Tucker and\r\nBiddle and Abraham Whipple.  They helped Paul Jones to strike\r\nterror into St. George's Channel.  In 1776, in the first year\r\nof the Revolutionary War, American privateers, most of them\r\nmanned by our fishermen, captured three hundred and forty-\r\ntwo British vessels.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries came up again after the war.  Mr. Jefferson\r\ncommended them to the favor of the nation in an elaborate\r\nand admirable report.  He said that before the war 8,000 men\r\nand 52,000 tons of shipping were annually employed by Massachusetts\r\nin the cod and whale fisheries.  England and France made urgent\r\nefforts and offered large bounties to get our fishermen to\r\nmove over there.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the fisheries were aided by direct bounties.\r\nLater the policy of protection has been substituted.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams has left on record that when he went abroad as\r\nour representative in 1778, and again when the Treaty of 1783\r\nwas negotiated, his knowledge of the fisheries and his sense\r\nof their importance were what induced him to take the mission.\r\nHe declared that unless our claims were fully recognized,\r\nthe States would carry on the war alone.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Because the people of New England, besides the natural claim\r\nof mankind to the gifts of Providence on their coast, are\r\nspecially entitled to the fishery by their charters, which\r\nhave never been declared forfeited.\"\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the articles of peace in the House of Lords,\r\nLord Loughborough, the ablest lawyer of his party, said:\r\n\r\n\"The fishery on the shores retained by Britain is in the\r\nnext article not ceded, but recognized as a right inherent in\r\nthe Americans, which though no longer British subjects, they\r\nare to continue to enjoy unmolested.\"\r\n\r\nThis was denied nowhere in the debate.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams took greater satisfaction in his achievement when\r\nhe secured our fisheries in the treaty of 1783 than in any\r\nother of the great acts of his life.*  After the treaty of 1783\r\nhe had a seal struck with the figures of the pine tree, the deer\r\nand the fish, emblems of the territory and the fisheries\r\nsecured in 1783.  He had it engraved anew in 1815 with the\r\nmotto, \"Piscemur, venemur, ut olim.\"  I have in my possession\r\nan impression taken from the original seal of 1815.  This\r\nletter from John Quincy Adams tells its story:\r\n\r\n\"QUINCY, September 3, 1836.\r\n\r\n_\"My Dear Son:_  On this day, the anniversary of the definitive\r\ntreaty of peace of 1783, whereby the independence of the United\r\nStates of America was recognized, and the anniversary of your\r\nown marriage, I give you a seal, the impression upon which\r\nwas a device of my father, to commemorate the successful assertion\r\nof two great interests in the negotiation for the peace, the\r\nliberty of the fisheries, and the boundary securing the acquisition\r\nof the western lands.  The deer, the pine tree, and the fish\r\nare the emblems representing those interests.\r\n\r\n\"The seal which my father had engraved in 1783 was without\r\nthe motto.  He gave it in his lifetime to your deceased brother\r\nJohn, to whose family it belongs.  That which I now give to\r\nyou I had engraved by his direction at London in 1815, shortly\r\nafter the conclusion of the treaty of peace at Ghent, on the\r\n24th of December, 1814, at the negotiation of which the same\r\ninterests, the fisheries, and the bounty had been deeply involved.\r\nThe motto, 'Piscemur, venemur, ut olim,' is from Horace.\r\n\r\n\"I request you, should the blessing of heaven preserve the\r\nlife of your son, Charles Francis, and make him worthy of\r\nyour approbation, to give it at your own time to him as a\r\ntoken of remembrance of my father, who gave it to me, and\r\nof yours.\r\n\r\n  \"JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\"\r\n  \"My son Charles Francis Adams.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* See Ante, p. 131.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nThe negotiations of 1815 and 1818 were under the control\r\nof as dauntless and uncompromising a spirit, and one quite\r\nas alive to the value of the fisheries and the dishonor of\r\nabandoning them as that of John Adams himself.  If John Quincy\r\nAdams, the senior envoy at Ghent, and the Secretary of State\r\nin 1818, had consented to a treaty bearing the construction\r\nwhich is lately claimed he never could have gone home to face\r\nhis father.  When the War of 1812 ended, Great Britain set\r\nup the preposterous claim that the war had abrogated all treaties,\r\nand that with the treaty of 1783 our rights in the fisheries\r\nwere gone.  There was alarm in New England; but it was quieted\r\nby the knowledge that John Quincy Adams was one of our representatives.\r\nIt was well said at that time that, as\r\n\r\n\"John Adams saved the fisheries once, his son would a second\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nWhen someone expressed a fear that the other commissioners\r\nwould not stand by his son, the old man wrote in 1814, that--\r\n\r\n\"Bayard, Russell, Clay, or even Gallatin, would cede the\r\nfee-simple of the United States as soon as they would cede\r\nthe fisheries.\"  (pp. 21-22).\r\n\r\nThese fisheries still support the important city of Gloucester,\r\nand are a very valuable source of wealth to the hardy and\r\nenterprising people who maintain them.  Their story is full\r\nof romance.  A touching yearly ceremonial is celebrated at\r\nthe present time in Gloucester in commemoration of the men\r\nwho are lost in this dangerous employment.\r\n\r\nBut the value of the fisheries does not consist chiefly in\r\nhistoric association or in the wealth which they contribute\r\nto any such community.\r\n\r\nThey are the nursery of seamen, more valuable and less costly\r\nthan the Naval School at Annapolis.  They train the men who\r\nare employed in them to get to be at home on the sea.  They\r\nare valuable for naval officers and for sailors.  Whenever\r\nthere shall be a war with a naval power, they will be thrown\r\nout of employ, and will seek service in our Navy.  All the\r\nEnglish authorities, I believe, concur in this opinion.  I\r\nread in my speech a very interesting letter from Admiral Porter\r\nwho testified strongly to that effect.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that many of our common sailors engaged\r\nin our cod and other fisheries are of foreign birth, it is\r\nequally true that they, almost all of them, come to live in\r\nthis country, get naturalized and become ardent Americans.\r\nThis is true of the natives of the British Dominions.  But\r\nit is still more true of the Scandinavians, a hardy and adventurous\r\nrace, faithful and brave, who become full of the spirit of\r\nAmerican nationality.\r\n\r\nMr. Bayard who was, I think, inspired by a patriotic and\r\npraiseworthy desire to establish more friendly relations\r\nwith Great Britain, seemed to me to give away the whole American\r\ncase, and to have been bamboozled by Joseph Chamberlain at\r\nevery point.  The Treaty gave our markets to Canada without\r\nanything of value to us in return, and afforded no just indemnity\r\nfor the past outrages of which we justly complained, and gave\r\nno security for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty, which required a two-thirds majority for its\r\nratification, was defeated by a vote of twenty-seven yeas\r\nto thirty nays.  There were nine Senators paired in the affirmative,\r\nand eight in the negative.  The vote was a strict party vote,\r\nwith the exception of Messrs. Palmer and Turpie, Democrats,\r\nwho were against it.\r\n\r\nI discussed the subject with great earnestness, going fully\r\ninto the history of the matter, and the merits of the Treaty.\r\nI think I may say without undue vanity that my speech was\r\nan important and interesting contribution to a very creditable\r\nchapter of our history.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nTHE FEDERAL ELECTIONS BILL\r\n\r\nIn December, 1889, the Republican Party succeeded to the legislative\r\npower in the country for the first time in sixteen years.\r\nSince 1873 there had been a Democratic President for four\r\nyears, and a Democratic House or Senate or both for the rest\r\nof the time.  There was a general belief on the part of the\r\nRepublicans, that the House of Representatives, as constituted\r\nfor fourteen years of that time, and that the Presidency itself\r\nwhen occupied by Mr. Cleveland, represented nothing but usurpation,\r\nby which, in large districts of the country, the will of the\r\npeople had been defeated.  There were some faint denials at\r\nthe time when these claims were made in either House of Congress\r\nas to elections in the Southern States.  But nobody seems\r\nto deny now, that the charges were true.  Mr. Senator Tillman\r\nof South Carolina stated in my hearing in the Senate:\r\n\r\n\"We took the Government away.  We stuffed ballot boxes.  We\r\nshot them.  We are not ashamed of it.  The Senator from Wisconsin\r\nwould have done the same thing.  I see it in his eye right\r\nnow.  He would have done it.  With that system--force, tissue\r\nballots, etc.--we got tired ourselves.  So we called a Constitutional\r\nConvention, and we eliminated, as I said, all of the colored\r\npeople whom we could under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.\r\n\r\n\"I want to call your attention to the remarkable change that\r\nhas come over the spirit of the dream of the Republicans;\r\nto remind you, gentlemen of the North, that your slogans of\r\nthe past--brotherhood of man and fatherhood of God--have gone\r\nglimmering down the ages.  The brotherhood of man exists no\r\nlonger, because you shoot negroes in Illinois, when they come\r\nin competition with your labor, and we shoot them in South\r\nCarolina, when they come in competition with us in the matter\r\nof elections.  You do not love them any better than we do.\r\nYou used to pretend that you did; but you no longer pretend\r\nit, except to get their votes.\r\n\r\n\"You deal with the Filipinos just as you deal with the negroes,\r\nonly you treat them a heap worse.\"\r\n\r\nNo Democrat rose to deny his statement, and, so far as I know,\r\nno Democratic paper contradicted it.  The Republicans, who\r\nhad elected President Harrison and a Republican House in 1888,\r\nwere agreed, with very few exceptions, as to the duty of providing\r\na remedy for this great wrong.  Their Presidential Convention,\r\nheld at Chicago in 1888, passed a resolution demanding, \"effective\r\nlegislation to secure integrity and purity of elections, which\r\nare the fountains of all public authority,\" and charged that\r\nthe \"present Administration and the Democratic majority in\r\nCongress owe their existence to the suppression of the ballot\r\nby a criminal nullification of the Constitution and the laws\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Senate at the winter session of 1888 and at the beginning\r\nof the December session of 1889, a good many Bills were introduced\r\nfor the security of National elections.  Similar Bills were\r\nintroduced in the House.  A special Committee was appointed\r\nthere to deal with that subject.  I had, myself, no doubt\r\nof the Constitutional authority of Congress, and of its duty,\r\nif it were able, to pass an effective law for that purpose.\r\n\r\nI was the Chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections,\r\nand it was my duty to give special attention to that subject.\r\nI had carefully prepared a Bill in the vacation, based on\r\none introduced by Mr. Sherman, providing for holding, under\r\nNational authority, separate registrations and elections for\r\nMembers of Congress.  But when I got to Washington, I found,\r\non consultation with every Republican Senator except one,\r\nthat a large majority were averse to an arrangement which\r\nwould double the cost of elections throughout the country,\r\nand which, in States where personal registration every year\r\nis required, would demand from every citizen his presence\r\nat the place of polling or registration four times every alternate\r\nyear.  That is, in the years when there were Congressmen to\r\nbe elected he must go twice to be registered--once for the\r\nState election, and once for the Congressional--and twice\r\nto vote.  So I drew another Bill.  I say I drew it.  But I\r\nhad the great advantage of consultation with Senator Spooner\r\nof Wisconsin, a very able lawyer who had lately come to the\r\nSenate, and I can hardly say that the Bill, as it was finally\r\ndrafted, was more mine or his.  This Bill provided, in substance,\r\nthat there should be National officers of both parties who\r\nshould be present at the registration and election of Members\r\nof Congress, and at the count of the vote, and who should\r\nknow and report everything which should happen, so that all\r\nfacts affecting the honesty of the election and the return\r\nmight be before the House of Representatives.  To this were\r\nadded some section providing for the punishment of bribery,\r\nfraud and misconduct of election officers.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the House of Representatives had appointed\r\na special Committee charged with a similar duty.  Members\r\nof that Committee saw me, and insisted, with a good deal of\r\nreason, that a measure which concerned the election of members\r\nof the House of Representatives, should originate in that\r\nbody.  Accordingly the Senate Committee held back its Bill,\r\nand awaited the action of the House, which sent a Bill to\r\nthe Senate, July 15, 1890.  The House Bill dealt not only\r\nwith the matter of elections, but also with the selection\r\nof juries, and some other important kindred subjects.  Our\r\nCommittee struck out from it everything that did not bear\r\ndirectly on elections; mitigated the severity of the penalties,\r\nand reduced the bulk of the Bill very considerably.  The measure\r\nwas reported in a new draft by way of substitute.  It remained\r\nbefore the Senate until the beginning of the next Session,\r\nwhen it was taken up for action.  It was a very simple measure.\r\n\r\nIt only extended the law which, with the approbation of both\r\nparties, had been in force in cities of more than twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants, to Congressional districts, when there\r\nshould be an application to the Court, setting forth the\r\nnecessity for its protection.  That law had received the\r\ncommendation of many leading Democrats, including S. S. Cox,\r\nSecretary Whitney, the four Democratic Congressmen who represented\r\nBrooklyn, and General Slocum, then Representative at large\r\nfrom the State of New York.  It had been put in force on the\r\napplication of Democrats quite as often as on that of Republicans.\r\nWe added to our Bill a provision that in case of a dispute\r\nconcerning an election certificate, the Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States in which the district was situated should hear\r\nthe case and should award a certificate entitling the member\r\nto be placed on the Clerk's roll, and to hold his seat until\r\nthe House itself should act on the case.  That provision was\r\ncopied from the English law of 1868 which has given absolute\r\npublic satisfaction there.  This was the famous Force Bill,\r\nand the whole of it--a provision that, if a sufficient petition\r\nwere made to the court for that purpose, officers, appointed\r\nby the court, belonging to both parties should be present\r\nand watch the election; that the Judge of the Circuit Court\r\nshould determine, in case of dispute, what name should be\r\nput on the roll of the House of Representatives, in the beginning,\r\nsubject to the Constitutional power of the House to correct\r\nit, and that a moderate punishment for bribery, intimidation\r\nand fraud, on indictment and conviction by a jury of the vicinage,\r\nshould be imposed.  That was the whole of it.\r\n\r\nBut the Southern Democratic leaders, with great adroitness,\r\nproceeded to repeat the process known as \"firing the Southern\r\nheart.\"  They persuaded their people that there was an attempt\r\nto control elections by National authority.  They realized\r\nthat the waning power of their party at the South, many of\r\nwhose business men saw that the path of prosperity for the\r\nSouth as well as for the North lay in the adoption of Republican\r\npolicies, might be reestablished by exciting the fear of negro\r\ndomination.  The Northern Democrats, either very ignorantly\r\nor wilfuly, united in the outcry.  Governor William E. Russell\r\nof Massachusetts, a gentleman of large influence and popularity\r\nwith both parties, telegraphed to President Cleveland a pious\r\nthanksgiving for the defeat of this \"wicked Bill.\"\r\n\r\nSome worthy Republican Senators became alarmed.  They thought,\r\nwith a good deal of reason, that it was better to allow existing\r\nevils and conditions to be cured by time, and the returning\r\nconscience and good sense of the people, rather than have\r\nthe strife, the result of which must be quite doubtful, which\r\nthe enactment and enforcement of this law, however moderate\r\nand just, would inevitably create.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, I came myself to the conclusion that, while\r\nthe Bill was reasonable and there was no reasonable doubt\r\nof the power of Congress to enact it, yet the attempt to pass\r\nit, if it were to fail, would do the cause infinite mischief.  It\r\nwould be an exhibition of impotence, always injurious to\r\na political party.  It would drive back into the Democratic\r\nParty many men who were afraid of negro domination; who looked\r\nwith great dislike on the assertion of National power over\r\nelections, and whom other considerations would induce to act\r\nwith the Republicans.  So I thought it was best to ascertain\r\ncarefully the prevailing opinion and see if we were likely\r\nto get the Bill through, and, if we found that unlikely, not\r\nto proceed far enough to have a debate in either House.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I visited the House of Representatives, saw several\r\nof my Massachusetts colleagues and some other leaders.  They\r\nagreed that, if I found that the Bill could not, in all probability,\r\npass the Senate, it should be arranged to lay it aside in\r\nthe House without making any serious movement for it there.\r\nAfter that arrangement was made there was a Senate caucus.\r\nI brought up the matter and moved the appointment of a Committee\r\nto consider the whole question of legislation with reference\r\nto the security of elections.  A gentleman who had recently\r\nbecome a Member of the Senate rose and quite angrily objected\r\nto taking up the matter for consideration.  He declared that\r\nhe would not consent to have the subject introduced in a\r\nRepublican caucus.  The proceedings of such caucuses are\r\nsupposed to be kept from the public.  But they are pretty\r\nsure to leak out.  I could not very well get up and say that\r\nmy reason for asking for a committee was to see whether the\r\nlaw should be suppressed or not.  So I did not urge my motion.\r\nBut I did the best I could.\r\n\r\nBefore reporting the Bill I saw every Republican Senator\r\nand obtained his opinion upon it.  I have in my possession\r\nthe original memoranda of the various answers.  Not only a\r\nmajority of the Republican Senators, but a majority of the\r\nwhole Senate declared emphatically for an Election Bill.  I\r\nfurther consulted them whether the authority, in case of a\r\ndisputed election, to order, upon hearing, the name of the\r\nperson found to be elected to be placed on the roll should\r\nbe lodged in the United States Courts, or in some special\r\ntribunal.  Two or three preferred that the court should not\r\nbe invoked.  But a majority of the whole Senate favored vesting\r\nthe power in the courts, and those who preferred another way\r\nstated that they were willing to abide by the judgment of\r\nthe Committee.\r\n\r\nWhen the House Bill came up, it was, on the 7th of August,\r\n1890, reported favorably with my Bill as a substitute.  Meantime\r\nthe McKinley Tariff Bill, which Mr. Cleveland had made, so\r\nfar as he could, the sole issue in the late election, had\r\nbeen matured and reported.  It affected all the business interests\r\nof the country.  They were in a state of uncertainty and alarm.\r\nMr. Quay of Pennsylvania proposed a resolution to the effect\r\nthat certain enumerated measures, not including the Election\r\nBill, should be considered at that session, and that all others\r\nshould be postponed.  That, I suppose, would have had the\r\nentire Democratic support and Republicans enough to give it\r\na majority.  It would have postponed the Election Bill without\r\ngiving any assurance of its consideration at the short session.\r\nSo a conference of Republicans was held at which an agreement\r\nwas made, which I drew up, and signed by a majority of the\r\nentire Senate.  It entitled the friends of the Election Bill to\r\nbe assured that it would be brought to a vote and passed at\r\nthe short session, if there were then a majority in its favor.\r\nThis is the agreement, of which I have the original, with\r\nthe original signatures annexed, in my possession.\r\n\r\n\"We will vote:  1.  To take up for consideration on the first\r\nday of the next session the Federal Election Bill, and to\r\nkeep it before the Senate to the exclusion of other legislative\r\nbusiness, until it shall be disposed of by a vote.  2.  To\r\nmake such provision as to the time and manner of taking the\r\nvote as shall be decided, by a majority of the Republican\r\nSenators, to be necessary in order to secure such vote, either\r\nby a general rule like that proposed by Mr. Hoar, and now\r\npending before the committee on rules, or by special rule of\r\nthe same purport, applicable only to the Election Bill.\"\r\n\r\nAt the next December session the Bill was taken up for consideration\r\nand, after a few days' debate, there was a motion to lay it\r\naside.  Since the measure had been first introduced, the sentiment\r\nin certain parts of the country in favor of the free coinage\r\nof silver had been strengthened.  Several of the Republican\r\nSenators were among its most zealous advocates.  There was\r\na motion to lay aside the Election Bill which was adopted\r\nby a bare majority--the Democrats voting for it and several\r\nof the Silver Republican Senators, so-called.  All but one\r\nof these had signed their names to the promise I have printed.\r\nI never have known by what process of reasoning they reconciled\r\ntheir action with their word.  But I know that in heated political\r\nstrife men of honor, even men of ability, sometimes deceive\r\nthemselves by a casuistic reasoning which would not convince\r\nthem at other times.\r\n\r\nThe Election Bill deeply excited the whole country.  Its\r\nsupporters were denounced by the Democratic papers everywhere,\r\nNorth and South, with a bitterness which I hardly knew before\r\nthat the English language was capable of expressing.  My mail\r\nwas crowded with letters, many of them anonymous, the rest\r\ngenerally quite as anonymous, even if the writer's name were\r\nsigned, denouncing me with all the vigor and all the scurrility\r\nof which the writers were capable.  I think this is the last\r\ngreat outbreak of anger which has spread through the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI got, however, a good deal of consolation from the stanch\r\nfriendship and support of the Republicans of Massachusetts,\r\nwhich never failed me during the very height of this storm.\r\nWhittier sent me a volume of poetry which he had just published,\r\nwith the inscription written on the blank leaf in his own\r\nhand, \"To George F. Hoar, with the love of his old friend,\r\nJohn G. Whittier.\"  I think I would have gone through ten\r\ntimes as much objurgation as I had to encounter for those\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\nThere has never since been an attempt to protect National\r\nelections by National authority.  The last vestige of the\r\nNational statute for securing purity of elections was repealed\r\nin President Cleveland's second Administration, under the\r\nlead of Senator Hill of New York.  I have reflected very carefully\r\nas to my duty in that matter.  I am clearly of the opinion\r\nthat Congress has the power to regulate the matter of elections\r\nof Members of the House of Representatives and to make suitable\r\nprovisions for honest elections and an honest ascertainment\r\nof the result, and that such legislation ought to be enacted\r\nand kept on the statute book and enforced.  But such legislation,\r\nto be of any value whatever, must be permanent.  If it only\r\nbe maintained in force while one political party is in power,\r\nand repealed when its antagonist comes in, and is to be constant\r\nmatter of political strife and sectional discussion, it is\r\nbetter, in my judgment, to abandon it than to keep up an incessant,\r\nfruitless struggle.  It is like legislation to prohibit by law\r\nthe selling of liquor.  I believe that it would be wise to\r\nprohibit the sale of liquor, with the exceptions usually made\r\nin prohibitory laws.  But if we are to have in any State,\r\nas we have had in so many States, a prohibitory law one year,\r\nanother with different provisions the next, a license law\r\nthe next, and the difficulty all the time in enforcing any\r\nof them, it is better to give the attempt at prohibition\r\nup and to adopt a local option, or high license, or some\r\nother policy.  In other words, it is better to have the second\r\nbest law kept permanently on the statute book than to have\r\nthe best law there half the time.\r\n\r\nSo, after Senator Hill's repealing act got through the Senate,\r\nI announced that, so far as I was concerned, and so far as\r\nI had the right to express the opinion of Northern Republicans,\r\nI thought the attempt to secure the rights of the colored\r\npeople by National legislation would be abandoned until there\r\nwere a considerable change of opinion in the country, and\r\nespecially in the South, and until it had ceased to be a matter\r\nof party strife.  To that announcement, Senator Chandler of\r\nNew Hampshire, who had been one of the most zealous advocates\r\nof the National laws, expressed his assent.  That statement\r\nhas been repeated once or twice on the floor of the Senate.\r\nSo far as I know, no Republican has dissented from it.  Certainly\r\nthere has been no Bill for that purpose introduced in either\r\nHouse of Congress, or proposed, so far as I know, in the Republican\r\npress, or in any Republican platform since.\r\n\r\nThe question upon which the policy of all National election\r\nlaws depends is, At whose will do you hold your right to be\r\nan American citizen?  What power can you invoke if that right\r\nbe withheld from you?  If you hold the right at will of your\r\nState, then you can invoke no power but the State for its\r\nvindication.  If you hold it at the will of the Nation, as\r\nexpressed by the people of the whole Nation under the Constitution\r\nof the United States, then you are entitled to invoke the\r\npower of the United States for its enforcement whenever necessary.\r\nIf you hold it at the will of the white Democracy of any State\r\nor neighborhood then, as unfortunately seems to be the case\r\nin a good many States, you will be permitted to exercise it\r\nonly if you are a white man, and then only so long as you\r\nare a Democrat.\r\n\r\nI have had during my whole life to deal with that most difficult\r\nof all political problems, the relation to each other, in\r\na Republic, of men of different races.  It is a question\r\nwhich has vexed the American people from the beginning of\r\ntheir history.  It is, if I am not much mistaken, to vex\r\nthem still more hereafter.  First the Indian, then the Negro,\r\nthen the Chinese, now the Filipino, disturb our peace.  In\r\nthe near future will come the Italian and the Pole and the\r\ngreat population of Asia, with whom we are soon to be brought\r\ninto most intimate and close relation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, in all these race difficulties and troubles,\r\nthe fault has been with the Anglo-Saxons.  Undoubtedly the\r\nIndian has been a savage; the Negro has been a savage; the\r\nlower order of Chinamen have been gross and sometimes bestial.\r\nThe inhabitants of the Philippine Islands, in their natural\r\nrights, which, as we had solemnly declared to be a self-evident\r\ntruth, were theirs beyond question, have committed acts of\r\nbarbarism.  But in every case, these inferior and alien races,\r\nif they had been dealt with justly, in my opinion, would have\r\nbeen elevated by quiet, peaceful and Christian conduct on\r\nour part to a higher plane, and brought out of their barbarism.\r\nThe white man has been the offender.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to recall the story of the methods by which\r\nthe political majorities, consisting in many communities\r\nlargely of negroes and led by immigrants from the North, were\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nThis is not a sectional question.\r\n\r\nIt is not a race question.  The suffrage was conferred on\r\nthe negro by the Southern States themselves.  They can always\r\nmake their own rules.  If the negro be ignorant, you may define\r\nignorance and disfranchise that.  If the negro be vicious,\r\nyou may define vice and disfranchise that.  If the negro be\r\npoor, you may define poverty and disfranchise that.  If the\r\nnegro be idle, you may define idleness and disfranchise that.\r\nIf the negro be lazy, you may define laziness and disfranchise\r\nthat.  If you will only disfranchise him for the qualities\r\nwhich you say unfit him to vote and not for his race or the\r\ncolor of his skin there is no Constitutional obstacle in your\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSo it was not wholly a race or color problem.  It was largely\r\na question of party supremacy.  In three states, Alabama,\r\nSouth Carolina and Florida, white Democrats charged each other\r\nwith stifling the voice of the majority by fraudulent election\r\nprocesses, and in Alabama they claimed that a majority of\r\nwhite men were disfranchised by a false count of negro votes\r\nin the black belt.\r\n\r\nIt was not wholly unnatural that the men who, in dealing\r\nwith each other, were men of scrupulous honor and of undoubted\r\ncourage should have brought themselves to do such things,\r\nor at any rate to screen and sympathize with the more hot-\r\nheaded men who did them.  The proof in the public records\r\nof those public crimes is abundant.  With the exception of\r\nReverdy Johnson of Maryland there is no record of a single\r\nmanly remonstrance, or expression of disapproval from the\r\nlips of any prominent Southern man.  But they had persuaded\r\nthemselves to believe that a contest for political power with\r\na party largely composed of negroes was a contest for their\r\ncivilization itself.  They thought it like a fight for life\r\nwith a pack of wolves.  In some parts of the South there were\r\nmen as ready to murder a negro who tried to get an office\r\nas to kill a fox they found prowling about a hen roost.  These\r\nbrave and haughty men who had governed the country for half\r\na century, who had held the power of the United States at\r\nbay for four years, who had never doffed their hats to any\r\nprince or noble on earth, even in whose faults or vices there\r\nwas nothing mean or petty, never having been suspected of\r\ncorruption, who as Macaulay said of the younger Pitt, \"If\r\nin an hour of ambition they might have been tempted to ruin\r\ntheir country, never would have stooped to pilfer from her,\"\r\ncould not brook the sight of a Legislature made up of ignorant\r\nnegroes who had been their own slaves, and of venal carpet-\r\nbaggers.  They could not endure that men, some of whom had\r\nbeen bought and sold like chattels in the time of slavery,\r\nand others ready to sell themselves, although they were freemen,\r\nshould sit to legislate for their States with their noble\r\nand brave history.  I myself, although I have always maintained,\r\nand do now, the equal right of all men of whatever color or\r\nrace to a share in the government of the country, felt a thrill\r\nof sadness when I saw the Legislature of Louisiana in session\r\nin the winter of 1873.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal to provoke them also in the character\r\nof some of the Northern men who had gone to the South to take\r\nan active part in political affairs.  Some of them were men\r\nof the highest character and honor, actuated by pure and unselfish\r\nmotives.  If they had been met cordially by the communities\r\nwhere they took up their abode they would have brought to\r\nthem a most valuable quality of citizenship.  If Northern\r\nimmigration and Northern capital had been welcomed at the\r\nSouth it would have had as helpful and influence as it had\r\nin California and Oregon.  But the Southern men treated them\r\nall alike.  I incline to think that a large number of the\r\nmen who got political office in the South, when the men who\r\nhad taken part in the Rebellion were still disfranchised,\r\nand the Republicans were still in power, were of a character\r\nthat would not have been tolerated in public office in the\r\nNorth.  General Willard Warner of Alabama, a brave Union soldier,\r\na Republican Senator from that State, was one of the best\r\nand bravest men who ever sat in that body.  Governor Packard\r\nof Louisiana was I believe a wise and honest man.  But in\r\ngeneral it was impossible not to feel a certain sympathy with\r\na people, who whatever else had been their faults never were\r\nguilty of corruption or meanness, or the desire to make money\r\nout of public office, in the intolerable loathing which they\r\nfelt for these strangers who had taken possession of the high\r\nplaces in their States.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant gave the influence and authority of his Administration\r\ntoward maintaining in power the lawfully chosen Republican\r\nState Governments.  But in spite of all he could do they had\r\nall been overthrown but two when the Presidential election\r\nwas held in 1876.  Those two were South Carolina and Louisiana.\r\nThe people of those two States had chosen Republican Governors\r\nat the State election held on the same day with the election\r\nof the President.  But these Governors could not hold their\r\npower twenty-four hours without the support of the National\r\nadministration.  When that was withdrawn the negro and carpet-\r\nbag majority was powerless as a flock of sheep before a pack\r\nof wolves to resist their brave and unscrupulous Democratic\r\nenemy, however inferior the latter in numbers.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to give a dispassionate account of the history\r\nof this great question which has entered so deeply into the\r\npolitical and social life of the American people almost from\r\nthe beginning, it is hard to measure the influence of race\r\nprejudice, of sectional feeling, and of that other powerful\r\nmotive, eagerness for party supremacy.\r\n\r\nSuffrage was conferred upon the negro by the Southern States\r\nthemselves.  Under the Constitution every State can prescribe\r\nits own qualifications for suffrage, with the single exception\r\nthat no State can deny or abridge the right of a citizen of\r\nthe United States to vote on account of race, color or previous\r\ncondition of servitude.\r\n\r\nBut I am bound to say, indeed it is but to repeat what I have\r\nsaid many times, that my long conflict with their leaders\r\nhas impressed me with an ever-increasing admiration of the\r\ngreat and high qualities of our Southern people.  I said at\r\nChicago in February, 1903, what I said, in substance, twenty\r\nyears before in Faneuil Hall, and at about the same time in\r\nthe Senate:\r\n\r\n\"Having said what I thought to say on this question, perhaps\r\nI may be indulged in adding that although my life, politically\r\nand personally, has been a life of almost constant strife\r\nwith the leaders of the Southern people, yet as I grow older\r\nI have learned, not only to respect and esteem, but to love\r\nthe great qualities which belong to my fellow citizens of\r\nthe Southern States.  They are a noble race.  We may well\r\ntake pattern from them in some of the great virtues which\r\nmake up the strength, as they make the glory, of Free States.\r\nTheir love of home; their chivalrous respect for women; their\r\ncourage; their delicate sense of honor; their constancy, which\r\ncan abide by an opinion or a purpose or an interest of their\r\nStates through adversity and through prosperity, through the\r\nyears and through the generations, are things by which the\r\npeople of the more mercurial North may take a lesson.  And\r\nthere is another thing--covetousness, corruption, the low\r\ntemptation of money has not yet found any place in our Southern\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my friends, we cannot afford to live, we don't wish\r\nto live, and we will not live, in a state of estrangement from\r\na people who possess these qualities.  They are our kindred;\r\nbone of our bone; flesh of our flesh; blood of our blood,\r\nand whatever may be the temporary error of any Southern State\r\nI, for one, if I have a right to speak for Massachusetts,\r\nsay to her, 'Entreat me not to leave thee, nor to return from\r\nfollowing after thee.  For where thou goest I will go, and\r\nwhere thou stayest, I will stay also.  And they people shall\r\nbe my people, and thy God my God.'\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1898, I was invited to deliver an address before\r\nthe Virginia Bar Association.  I was received by that company\r\nof distinguished gentlemen with a hospitality like that I\r\nhad found in Charleston the year before.  Certainly the old\r\nestrangements are gone.  I took occasion in my address to\r\nappeal to the Virginia bar to give the weight of their great\r\ninfluence in sustaining the dignity and authority of the Supreme\r\nCourt, in spite of their disappointment at some of its decisions\r\nof Constitutional questions.  They received what I had to\r\nsay, although they knew I differed from them on some of the\r\ngravest matters which concerned the State, and had been an\r\nanti-slavery man from my youth, with a respect and courtesy\r\nwhich left nothing to be desired.  At the banquet which followed\r\nthe address, this toast was given by William Wirt Henry, a\r\ngrandson of Patrick Henry, himself one of the foremost lawyers\r\nand historians of the South.  I prize very highly the original\r\nwhich I have in his handwriting.\r\n\r\n  \"Massachusetts and Virginia.\r\n  \"Foremost in planting the English Colonies in America;\r\n  \"Foremost in resisting British tyranny;\r\n  \"Foremost in the Revolution which won our Independence\r\n  and established our free institutions;\r\n  \"May the memories of the past be the bond of the future.\"\r\n\r\nMy own endeavor, during my long public life, has been to\r\nmaintain the doctrine of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhich declares the right of every man to political equality\r\nby virtue of his manhood, and of every people to self-government\r\nby virtue of its character as a people.  This our fathers\r\nmeant to lay down as the fundamental law of States and of\r\nthe United States, having its steadfast and immovable foundation\r\nin the law of God.  It was never their purpose to declare\r\nthat ignorance or vice or want of experience of the institutions\r\nof a country should not disqualify men from a share in the\r\nGovernment.  Those things they meant to leave to the discretion\r\nof the power, whether State or National, which was to prescribe\r\nthe qualifications of suffrage.  But they did not mean that\r\nthe accident of birthplace, or the accident of race, or the\r\naccident of color, should enter into the question at all.\r\nTo this doctrine I have, in my humble way, endeavored to adhere.\r\nIn dealing with the Chinese, or any class of immigrants, I\r\nwould prescribe as strict a rule as the strictest for ascertaining\r\nwhether the immigrant meant in good faith to be an American\r\ncitizen, whether he meant to end his life here, to bring his\r\nwife and children with him, whether he loved American institutions,\r\nwhether he was fit to understand the political problems with\r\nwhich the people had to deal, whether he had individual worth,\r\nor health of body or mind.  I would make, if need be, ten\r\nyears or twenty years, as the necessary period of residence\r\nfor naturalization.\r\n\r\nI would deal with the Negro or the German or the Frenchman\r\nor the Italian on the same principle.  But the one thing\r\nI have never consented to is that a man shall be kept out of\r\nthis country, or kept in a position of inferiority, while he is\r\nin it, because of his color, because of his birthplace, or\r\nbecause of his race.\r\n\r\nOne matter in connection with the management of the Elections\r\nBill I have never been able to think of since without a shudder.\r\nThe Democrats in the Senate, led by Mr. Gorman, the most\r\nskilful of their leaders, endeavored to defeat the bill by\r\nthe tactics of delay.  If the debate could be prolonged so\r\nthat it was impossible to get a vote without the loss of the\r\ngreat Appropriations Bills, or some of them, the bill, of\r\ncourse, must be laid aside.  So the Republicans, on the other\r\nhand, as is usual in such cases, refrained from debate, leaving\r\ntheir antagonists to take up the time.  Every afternoon at\r\nabout five o'clock some Democrat would come to me saying that\r\nhe was to take the floor, but that he did not feel well, or\r\nwas not quite ready with some material, and ask me as a personal\r\nfavor to let the matter go over until the next morning.  This\r\nhappened so often that I became satisfied it was a concerted\r\nscheme, and made up my mind that I would not yield to such\r\na request again.\r\n\r\nBut one afternoon Senator Wilson of Maryland, a quiet and\r\nmost estimable gentleman, whom I had known very well, and\r\nfor whom I had a high regard, came to me and said he felt\r\nquite unwell; he could go on that afternoon, if I insisted\r\nupon it; but he would like much better to put off speaking\r\ntill the next day.  I was just beginning my answer to the\r\neffect that I had heard that so often that I had determined I\r\nwould not yield again to the request.  But I said to myself,\r\nIt cannot be possible that this man would undertake to deceive\r\nme.  He is a gentleman of high character, absolutely honorable\r\nand incapable of falsehood.  So I answered, Of course, Mr.\r\nWilson, if you are ill, I will consent to your desire.  Mr.\r\nWilson made his speech the next day.  This was December 15.\r\nA few weeks after, on the 24th of February, Mr. Wilson died\r\nsuddenly of heart disease.  It was an affection of which he\r\nhad been conscious for some years, and which he had for some\r\ntime expected would cause sudden death.  I dare say if he\r\nhad been compelled to proceed with his speech that day it\r\nwould have been fatal.  In that case my life would have been\r\nembittered by the memory.\r\n\r\nWe had a meeting of the Republican members of the Committee,\r\nfor consultation, before we reported the Bill.  Mr. Evarts,\r\nwhile he approved the principle of the measure, shared very\r\nstrongly my own hesitation, caused by the fear of the political\r\neffect of the defeat of a measure likely to excite so much\r\nangry strife throughout the country.  After hearing the opinion\r\nof those who favored going on with the Bill, Mr. Evarts said:\r\n\"I spent a Sunday with Judge Kent on the Hudson a good many\r\nyears ago, with several New York lawyers.  We all went to\r\nthe Episcopal church in the forenoon, and dined with the Judge\r\nafter church.  During the service one of the company kept\r\nfar behind in the responses, which annoyed the Judge a good\r\ndeal.  At dinner he broke out, 'Davis, why can't you descend\r\ninto hell with the rest of the congregation?' I will descend\r\ninto hell with the rest of the congregation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Evarts made the descent and stood loyally by the measure\r\nin the debate to the best of his great ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL\r\nSUCCESSION BILL\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the Senate, I found one very serious inconvenience\r\nand one very great public danger in existing conditions.\r\n\r\nThe great inconvenience grew out of the fact that by the Constitution\r\nthe session of Congress must end on the fourth of March every\r\nother year.  A third of the Senate goes out at the same time,\r\nand every fourth year the Presidential term ends.  That session\r\nof Congress meets, according to our usage, on the first Monday\r\nof December.  The meeting cannot well come much earlier without\r\npreventing the members of the two Houses of Congress from\r\ntaking part in the political campaign, where they are justly\r\nexpected by the people to give an account of their stewardship,\r\nand to discuss the questions to be considered by the people\r\nin the election.  So there are but thirteen weeks in which\r\nto pass fourteen or fifteen great Appropriation Bills, making\r\nit impossible to deal with any other great subject except by\r\nunanimous consent.  The result is also that the Appropriation\r\nBills are put in the power of a very few men indeed.  The\r\nHouse has to submit to the dictation of the Appropriation\r\nCommittee, and cannot be allowed to debate, or even to have\r\na separate vote on matters which nearly the whole House would\r\nlike to accomplish, if there were time, but which the Chairman\r\nof the Appropriation Committee, who is usually omnipotent\r\nwith his associates, may happen to dislike.  On the other\r\nhand, in the Senate, where there is no cloture rule, any single\r\nmember, or at best, a very few members, can defeat an Appropriation\r\nBill and compel an extra session by exercising their right\r\nof uncontrolled debate.\r\n\r\nBesides; people from all parts of the country like to attend\r\nthe inauguration of a new President.  The fourth of March\r\nis at an inclement season, and is apt to be an inclement day,\r\nand it may come on Saturday or Sunday or Monday.  So persons\r\nwho attend may be obliged to be away from home over Sunday,\r\nand a great many persons have lost their health or life from\r\nexposure in witnessing the inauguration.\r\n\r\nI prepared a Constitutional amendment providing that the inauguration\r\nshould take place on the last Thursday in April.  I have reported\r\nthis to the Senate several times.  It has always passed that\r\nbody with scarcely a dissenting vote, on debate and explanation.\r\nIf that had been adopted, if the session were to begin in\r\nthe middle of November, a week after the November elections--\r\nwhich could be accomplished by an act of Congress--instead\r\nof thirteen weeks, to which the session is now limited, there\r\nwould be a session of twenty-three or twenty-four weeks.  This\r\nwould give time for the consideration of such legislation\r\nas might be needful.  It would probably, also, permit the\r\nshortening somewhat of the long session, which not infrequently\r\nextends to July or August.  But the plan has never found\r\nmuch favor in the House.  Speaker Reed, when he was in power,\r\nsaid rather contemptuously, that \"Congress sits altogether\r\ntoo long as it is.  The less we have of Congress, the better.\"\r\n\r\nThe public danger is found in the fact that there is no provision\r\nin the Constitution for the case where the President-elect\r\ndies before inauguration.  The provision is:\r\n\r\n\"In case of the Removal of the President from Office, or\r\nof his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the\r\nPowers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve\r\non the Vice-President, and the Congress may by Law provide\r\nfor the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability,\r\nboth of the President and Vice-President, declaring what Officer\r\nshall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly,\r\nuntil the Disability shall be removed, or a President shall\r\nbe elected.\"\r\n\r\nStrictly construed, it is only in the case of the death,\r\ninability, etc., of a President, that a Vice-President can\r\nsucceed, or in the case of the death, inability, etc., of the President\r\nand Vice-President both, that Congress has power to declare\r\non whom the office shall devolve.  It must be a President\r\nand Vice-President that die; not merely a President and Vice-\r\nPresident-elect.  That his is not an imaginary danger is shown\r\nby the fact of the well-known scheme to assassinate Lincoln\r\non his way to the seat of the Government, and also by the\r\nfact that either the President or the Vice-President has died\r\nin office so many times in the recollection of men now living.\r\nPresident Harrison died during his term; President Taylor\r\ndied during his term; Vice-President King died during Pierce's\r\nterm; Vice-President Wilson died during Grant's term; President\r\nGarfield died during his term; Vice-President Hendricks died\r\nduring Cleveland's term; Vice-President Hobart died during\r\nMcKinley's term, and President McKinley during his own second\r\nterm.  So within sixty years eight of these high officials\r\nhave died in office; five of them within thirty years; four\r\nof them within twenty years.\r\n\r\nI have also drawn and repeatedly procured the passage through\r\nthe Senate of an amendment to the Constitution to protect\r\nthe country against this danger.  That also has failed of\r\nattention in the House.  I suppose it is likely that nothing\r\nwill be done about the matter until the event shall happen,\r\nas is not unlikely, that both President and Vice-President-\r\nelect shall become incapacitated between the election and\r\nthe time for entering upon office.\r\n\r\nI was more successful in providing against another situation\r\nthat might prove quite awkward.  In Washington's Administration\r\nCongress exercised, as far as it could, the power given by\r\nthe Constitution to provide against the death or disability\r\nof both the President and Vice-President, if it should happen\r\nafter they had entered upon office, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In case of removal, death, resignation or inability of both\r\nthe President and the Vice-President of the United States,\r\nthe President of the Senate, or, if there is none, then the\r\nSpeaker of the House, for the time being, shall act as President,\r\nuntil the disability is removed or a President elected.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that when this awkward arrangement was\r\nmade, the proposition that the Secretary of State should succeed\r\nin the case of such vacancy was defeated by the suggestion\r\nthat Mr. Jefferson had too much power and consequence already.\r\nThe arrangement seemed to me clearly objectionable.  In the\r\nfirst place the Vice-President, who, it is supposed, has died\r\nor become incapable, is the Constitutional President of the\r\nSenate.  The Senate, under the practice and construction of\r\nits power which prevailed down to a very recent period, only\r\nelected a President pro tempore when the Vice-President vacated\r\nthe chair.  His office terminated when the Vice-President\r\nresumed it, and there was no Constitutional obligation on\r\nthe Senate to elect a President pro tempore at all.  So it\r\nwas quite uncertain whether there would be a President pro\r\ntempore of the Senate at any particular time, especially when\r\nthe Senate was not in session.  There have been two instances\r\nwhere the President of the Senate has refused to vacate the\r\nchair, for the reason that he did not desire to have a President\r\npro tempore elected, and thereby have an honor conferred on\r\na member of another party than his own.  That happened once\r\nin the case of Vice-President Gerry, and again, within my\r\npersonal knowledge, in the case of Vice-President Arthur.\r\nWhen he succeeded to the Presidency there was no President\r\nof the Senate who would have taken his place if he too had\r\nhappened to be assassinated.  So of the Speaker of the House.\r\nFor a great many years the first session of a newly-elected\r\nHouse of Representatives has begun in December.  There is\r\nno Speaker from the previous fourth of March until that time.\r\nBeside, the Senate, whose members hold office for six years\r\nand of whom only one-third goes out every two years, is very\r\napt to have a majority whose political opinions are opposed\r\nto those which have prevailed in the last Presidential election.\r\nSo, if the President and Vice-President both die before taking\r\ntheir seats, the President of the Senate is quite likely to\r\nbring into the Executive Office opinions which the people\r\nhave just rejected in the election.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Secretary of State is always a member\r\nof the party that has prevailed in the last election, and\r\nis usually the member of the party, next to the President\r\nhimself, highest in its confidence.  Our Secretaries of State,\r\nwith rare exceptions, have been among the very ablest public\r\nmen of the country.  Among them have been Timothy Pickering,\r\nJohn Marshall, James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams,\r\nHenry Clay, Martin Van Buren, Edward Livingston, Louis McLane,\r\nJohn Forsyth, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, James Buchanan,\r\nJohn M. Clayton, Edward Everett, Elihu B. Washburne, Hamilton\r\nFish, William M. Evarts, James G. Blaine, Thomas F. Bayard,\r\nJohn Sherman, and John Hay.  These men, with scarcely an exception,\r\nhave been among the very foremost statesmen of their time.\r\nSeveral of them have been Presidents of the United States,\r\nand a good many more of them have been prominent candidates\r\nfor the Presidency.  On the other hand, the list of Presidents\r\nof the Senate contains few names of any considerable distinction.\r\nAnother objection to the arrangement was the fact that the\r\nPresident of the Senate and the Speaker of the House might\r\nbe changed at the will of the body that elected them.  So\r\nthe acting President might be displaced at the will of a political\r\nbody.  There is a good deal of reason, also, for claiming\r\nthat if Congress declare that the officer shall act as President,\r\nhe must discharge the duties of his office and the duties\r\nof the President at the same time, a burden which would be\r\nvery hard for one man to support.  Accordingly I drew and\r\nintroduced the existing law, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n_\"Be it enacted, etc.,_ That in case of removal, death, resignation\r\nor inability of both the President and Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States, the Secretary of State, or if there be none,\r\nor in case of his removal, death, resignation or inability,\r\nthen the Secretary of the Treasury, or if there be none, or\r\nin the case of his removal, death, resignation or inability,\r\nthen the Secretary of War, or if there be none, or in case\r\nof his removal, death, resignation or inability, then the\r\nAttorney-General, or if there be none, or in case of his\r\nremoval, death, resignation or inability, then the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, shall act as President until the disability of the\r\nPresident or Vice-President is removed or a President shall\r\nbe elected:\r\n\r\n\"_Provided,_ That whenever the powers and duties of the office\r\nof President of the United States shall devolve upon any of\r\nthe person named herein, if Congress be not then in session,\r\nor if it would not meet in accordance with law within twenty\r\ndays thereafter, it shall be the duty of the person upon whom\r\nsaid powers and duties shall devolve to issue a proclamation\r\nconvening Congress in extraordinary session, giving twenty\r\ndays' notice of time of meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 2.  That the preceding section shall only be held to\r\ndescribe and apply to such officers as shall have been appointed\r\nby the advice and consent of the Senate to the offices therein\r\nnamed, and such as are eligible to the office of President\r\nunder the Constitution, and not under impeachment by the House\r\nof Representatives of the United States at the time the powers\r\nand duties of the office shall devolve upon them respectively.\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 3.  That sections one hundred and forty-six, one hundred\r\nand forty-seven, one hundred and forty-eight, one hundred\r\nand forty-nine and one hundred and fifty of the Revised Statutes\r\nare hereby repealed.  (_January_ 19, 1886).\"\r\n\r\nThere was some objection to it at first.  It was resisted very\r\nstrenuously to the end by Senator Edmunds.  But after full\r\ndiscussion it passed the Senate with few dissenting votes.\r\n\r\nIn the House Mr. Reed, afterward Speaker, appealed without\r\nsuccess to the political feeling of his associates, demanding\r\nto know if they would rather have Mr. Bayard, who was then\r\nSecretary of State, than John Sherman, who then happened to\r\nbe President of the Senate, for President of the United States.\r\nBut the House, also, by a large majority, passed the measure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nPRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S JUDGES\r\n\r\nI earnestly supported William B. Hornblower against the opposition\r\nof Senator Hill, when he was nominated by Mr. Cleveland for\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court of the United States.  I was then\r\non the Judiciary Committee.  I made very careful inquiry,\r\nand had reason to believe that the best lawyers in New York\r\nthought highly of him.  Judge Gray told me that Mr. Hornblower\r\nhad argued a case in the Court not long before, and that as\r\nthe Judges walked out Judge Blatchford said to him: \"I hope\r\nyou have as good a man in your Circuit to succeed you, when\r\nthe time comes, as we have in ours in Mr. Hornblower to succeed\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nI did not, however, support Mr. Wheeler H. Peckham.  The newspapers\r\ncirculated the story extensively that--to use the phrase of\r\none of them--I \"led the opposition.\" That was not true.  I\r\nexpected to vote for Mr. Peckham until just before the vote\r\nwas taken.  I had communicated my expectation to support him\r\nto Senator Vilas, who had charge of the case.  I thought before\r\nthe vote was taken it was my duty to tell him I had changed\r\nmy mind.  So I went round to his seat and told him.  Nobody\r\nelse knew my purpose till I voted.\r\n\r\nI had no political sympathy with Senator Hill, still less\r\nwith the claim often imputed to the Senate by writers of\r\nnewspapers, but of which I have never seen the slightest\r\nevidence, that Senators have the right to dictate such appointments.\r\nBut I thought Mr. Cleveland ought not to have made such an\r\nappointment without consulting Mr. Hill, who was a lawyer\r\nof eminence and knew the sentiment of the majority of the\r\nDemocratic Party.  Mr. Cleveland had nominated in succession\r\ntwo persons to an office which ought to be absolutely non-\r\npartisan, who belonged to a very small company of men devoted\r\nto his personal fortunes, who had bitterly attacked Mr. Hill.\r\nI should not, however, have deemed this objection sufficient\r\nto justify a vote against Mr. Peckham, but for the fact that\r\nI became satisfied he was a man of strong prejudices, with\r\nlittle of the judicial temper or quality about him, and quite\r\nlikely to break down under the strain of heavy responsibility.\r\n\r\nI urged Mr. Vilas to ask President Cleveland to send in the\r\nname of Mr. Hornblower again, having some hope that the Senate\r\nwould reconsider its action in his case.  But President Cleveland\r\nsolved the difficulty quite skilfully by sending in the name\r\nof Senator White of Louisiana, a most admirable gentleman\r\nand Judge, and afterward, when there came another vacancy,\r\nthat of Rufus W. Peckham of New York, both of whom were confirmed,\r\nI believe, without an objection.\r\n\r\nI just referred to Senator William F. Vilas, of Wisconsin.\r\nI should like to put on record my great esteem for his character\r\nas a man, and the excellence of his service as a Senator.\r\nHe was on the Judiciary Committee while I was Chairman, and\r\nalso for a time when his party had the majority.  He was industrious,\r\nwise, conservative, courteous, and fair, a most admirable\r\nlawyer, full of public spirit, well acquainted with the mechanism\r\nof the Government, and doing always much more than his full\r\nshare of the work of the Committee and of the Senate.  I hope\r\nthe country may have again the benefit of his great ability\r\nin some department of the public service.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Fuller said with singular felicity:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Justice Lamar always underrated himself.  This tendency\r\nplainly sprung from a vivid imagination.  With him the splendid\r\npassions attendant upon youth never faded into the light of\r\ncommon day, but they kept before him as an ideal, the impossibility\r\nof whose realization, as borne in upon him from time to time,\r\nopposed him with a sense of failure.  Yet the conscientiousness\r\nof his work was not lessened, nor was the acuteness of his\r\nintellect obscured by these natural causes of his discontent;\r\nnor did a certain Oriental dreaminess of the temperament ever\r\nallure him to abandon the effort to accomplish something that\r\nwould last after his lips were dumb.\"\r\n\r\nMatthew Arnold says in one of his essays that Americans lack\r\ndistinction.  I have a huge liking for Matthew Arnold.  He\r\nhad a wonderful intellectual vision.  I do not mean to say\r\nthat his three lectures on translating Homer are the greatest\r\nliterary work of our time.  But I think, on the whole, that\r\nI should rather have the pair of intellectual eyes which can\r\nsee Homer as he saw him, than any other mental quality I can\r\nthink of.  But Mr. Arnold has never seemed to me to be fortunate\r\nin his judgment about Americans.  He allows this quality of\r\ndistinction to Grant, but denies it, for all the world, to\r\nAbraham Lincoln.  The trouble with Mr. Arnold is that he\r\nnever travelled in the United States, when on this side the\r\nAtlantic.  He spent his time with a few friends who had little\r\nlove for things American.  He visited a great city or two,\r\nbut never made himself acquainted with the American people.\r\nHe never knew the sources of our power, or the spirit of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nYet there is a good deal of truth in what he says of the\r\nAmericans of our time.  It is still more true of the Englishmen\r\nof our time.  The newspaper, and the telegraph, and the telephone,\r\nand the constant dissemination of news, the public library\r\nand the common school and college mix up all together and\r\ntend to make us, with some rare and delightful exceptions,\r\neminently commonplace.  Certainly the men who are sent to\r\nCongress do not escape this wearying quality.  I know men\r\nwho have been in public office for more than a generation,\r\nwho have had enormous power and responsibility, to whom the\r\ncountry is indebted for safety and happiness, who never said\r\na foolish thing, and rarely ever when they had the chance\r\nfailed to do a wise one, who are utterly commonplace.  You\r\ncould not read the story of their public career without going\r\nto sleep.  They never said anything worth quoting, and never\r\ndid anything that any other equally good and sensible man\r\nwould not have done in their place.  I have a huge respect\r\nfor them.  I can never myself attain to their excellence.\r\nYet I would as lief spend my life as an omnibus horse as live\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nBut we have occasionally some delightful exceptions.  It\r\nso happens that some of the best, most attractive men I have\r\nknown, were from the South.  They are men who stood by the\r\nSouthern people through thick and thin during the Rebellion,\r\nand in resisting every attempt on the part of the victorious\r\nNorthern majority to raise the colored people to a political\r\nequality.  They have all of them, I believe, been Free Traders.\r\nIn general they have opposed the construction of the Constitution\r\nwhich has prevailed in New England and throughout the North,\r\nand in which I have myself always believed.\r\n\r\nI have never had much personal intimacy with any of them.\r\nI have had some vigorous conflicts with one or two of them.\r\nYet I have had from each before our association ended, assurances\r\nof their warm personal regard.  One of them, perhaps, on the\r\nwhole, the most conspicuous, is Lucius Q. C. Lamar.  His\r\nvery name, Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus, indicates that his\r\nfather must have looked for his example for his son to follow\r\nfar away from the American life about him.\r\n\r\nLamar was one of the most delightful of men.  His English\r\nstyle, both in conversation and in public speaking, was fresh\r\nand original, well adapted to keep his hearers expectant and\r\nalert, and to express the delicate and subtle shades of meaning\r\nthat were required for the service of his delicate and subtle\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nHe had taken the part of the South with great zeal.  He told\r\nme shortly before he left the Senate that he thought it was\r\na great misfortune for the world that the Southern cause had\r\nbeen lost.  He stood by his people, as he liked to call them,\r\nin their defeat and in their calamity without flinching or\r\nreservation.  While he would, I am sure, have done nothing\r\nhimself not scrupulously honorable, and while there was nothing\r\nin his nature of cruelty, still less of brutality, yet he\r\ndid not stop to inquire into matters of right and wrong when\r\na Southerner had got into trouble, by reason of anything a\r\nwhite Democrat had done in conflict with the National authority.\r\nYet Mr. Lamar desired most sincerely the reconciliation of\r\nthe sections, that the age-long strife should come to an end\r\nand be forgotten, and that the whole South should share the\r\nprosperity and wealth and refinement and contentment, which\r\nsubmission to the new order of things would bring.\r\n\r\nHe was a far-sighted man.  He was not misled by temporary\r\nexcitement or by deference to the majority of his political\r\nfriends who were less far-sighted than he, into any mistakes.\r\nWhen there was an attempt to break faith in regard to what\r\nwas called the Wheeler compromise in the Democratic House,\r\nMr. Lamar interposed and prevented it.  Just after the count\r\nunder the Electoral Commission had been completed, there was\r\na very dangerous movement to delay action on the returns from\r\nVermont, which would have prevented the completion of the\r\nwork before the 4th of March.  Mr. Lamar put forth all his\r\npowerful influence among his Democratic associates on the\r\nfloor of the House, and saved the peace of the country.  He\r\nknew very well that the cause of the South, as he would have\r\ncalled it, and the cause of the Democratic Party itself, would\r\nnot be promoted by a new civil convulsion, still less by any\r\nbreach of faith.\r\n\r\nHe voted against the free coinage of silver in spite of the\r\nfact that the people of his State earnestly favored it, and\r\nagainst the express instructions of its Legislature.  In 1874,\r\nat a time when the passions of the Civil War seemed to blaze\r\nhigher, and the angry conflict between the sections seemed\r\nto blaze higher even than during the war itself, he astonished\r\nand shocked the people of the South by pronouncing a tender\r\nand affectionate eulogy on Charles Sumner.  He testified to\r\nSumner's high moral qualities, to his intense love of liberty,\r\nto his magnanimity, and to his incapacity for a personal\r\nanimosity, and regretted that he had restrained the impulse\r\nwhich had been strong on him to go to Mr. Sumner and offer\r\nhim his hand and his heart with it.  It would have been almost\r\nimpossible for any other man who had done either of these\r\nthings to go back to Mississippi and live.  But it never shook\r\nfor a moment the love for Lamar of a people who knew so well\r\nhis love for them.\r\n\r\nAfterward Mr. Lamar was made an Associate Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States.  I voted against him--in which\r\nI made a mistake--not because I doubted his eminent integrity\r\nand ability, but because I thought that he had little professional\r\nexperience and no judicial experience, and that his health--\r\nhe was then beginning to show signs of the disease which\r\nended his life shortly after--was not sufficient for undertaking\r\nthe great study and the labor which the new office would require.\r\nHe was not long on the Bench, and was not greatly distinguished\r\nas a Judge.  But he wrote a few opinions which showed his\r\ngreat intellectual capacity for dealing with the most complicated\r\nlegal questions, especially such are apt to arise in patent\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nHe was a delightful man in ordinary conversation.  He had\r\nan infinite wit and great sense of humor.  He used to tell\r\ndelightful stories of queer characters and events that had\r\ncome within his own observation.  My relations to him for a\r\ngood while were entirely antagonistic.  We had some very\r\nsharp controversies.  He would never tolerate any expression,\r\nin his presence, of disrespect to Jefferson Davis.  He would\r\nalways meet the statement that Mr. Davis was a traitor with\r\na vigorous denial.  When I made a motion excepting Jefferson\r\nDavis from the benefit of the bill to pension the soldiers\r\nof the Mexican War, Mr. Lamar compared him to Prometheus,\r\nand me to the vulture preying upon his liver.  He was the\r\nlast person from whom I should have expected an expression\r\nof compliment, or even of kindness in those days.  Yet when\r\nthe question of my reelection was pending in 1883 and the\r\ncorrespondent of a newspaper which was among my most unrelenting\r\nand unscrupulous opponents thought he might get some material\r\nwhich would help him in his attacks, called upon Mr. Lamar\r\nin the Democratic cloak room, and asked him what he thought\r\nof me, Mr. Lamar replied in language which seems almost ridiculous\r\nto quote, and which was inspired only by his indignation\r\nat the attempt to use him for such a purpose:  \"Sir, Massachusetts\r\nhas never been more powerfully represented in the Senate,\r\nnot even in the time of Daniel Webster, than by Mr. Hoar.\"\r\n\r\nIt was with feeling of great pleasure that in 1886 I saw\r\nHarvard confer her highest honor on this delightful Mississippian.\r\n\r\nHe was, in his time, I think, the ablest representative,\r\ncertainly among the ablest, of the opinions opposed to mine.\r\nHe had a delightful and original literary quality which, if\r\nthe lines of his life had been cast amid other scenes than\r\nthe tempest of a great Revolution and Civil War, might have\r\nmade him a dreamer like Montaigne; and a chivalrous quality\r\nthat might have made him a companion of Athos and D'Artagnan.\r\n\r\nHis eulogy on Calhoun, with whom in general he sympathized,\r\nwas a masterpiece of eloquence, but his eulogy on Charles\r\nSumner, which probably no other man in the South could have\r\nuttered without political death, was greater still.  It was\r\na good omen for the country.  At the moment he uttered it,\r\nI suppose Charles Sumner was hated throughout the South with\r\nan intensity which in this day of reconciliation it is almost\r\nimpossible to conceive.  Yet Mr. Lamar in his place in the\r\nHouse of Representatives dared to utter these sentences:\r\n\r\n\"Charles Sumner was born with an instinctive love of freedom,\r\nand was educated from his earliest infancy to the belief that\r\nfreedom is the natural and indefeasible right of every intelligent\r\nbeing having the outward form of man.  In him, in fact, this\r\ncreed seems to have been something more than a doctrine imbibed\r\nfrom teachers, or a result of education.  To him it was a\r\ngrand intuitive truth, inscribed in blazing letters upon the\r\ntablet of his inner consciousness, to deny which would have\r\nbeen for him to deny that he himself existed.  And along with\r\nthe all-controlling love of freedom he possessed a moral sensibility\r\nkeenly intense and vivid, a conscientiousness which would\r\nnever permit him to swerve by the breadth of a hair from what\r\nhe pictured to himself as the path of duty.  Thus were combined\r\nin him the characteristics which have in all ages given to\r\nreligion her martyrs, and to patriotism her self-sacrificing\r\nheroes.\"\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of the kindness of Mr. Sumner to the South,\r\nand his spirit of magnanimity, he added:\r\n\r\n\"It was my misfortune, perhaps my fault, personally never\r\nto have known this eminent philanthropist and statesman.\r\nThe impulse was often strong upon me to go to him and offer\r\nhim my hand, and my heart with it, and to express to him my\r\nthanks for his kind and considerate course toward the people\r\nwith whom I am identified.  If I did not yield to that impulse,\r\nit was because the thought occurred that other days were coming\r\nin which such a demonstration might be more opportune and less\r\nliable to misconstruction.  Suddenly and without premonition,\r\na day as come at last to which, for such a purpose, there\r\nis no to-morrow.  My regret is therefore intensified by the\r\nthought that I failed to speak of him out of the fulness of\r\nmy heart while there was yet time.\"\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Lamar well understood what was to be the effect\r\nof this wonderful speech upon the whole country is shown\r\nby his letter to his wife the next day, in which he says:  \"I\r\nnever in all my life opened my lips with a purpose more single\r\nto the interests of our Southern people than when I made this\r\nspeech.\"\r\n\r\nI said of this speech in an article in the _North American\r\nReview:_\r\n\r\n\"The eloquent words of Mr. Lamar so touched the hearts of\r\nthe people of the North that they may fairly be said to have\r\nbeen of themselves an important influence in mitigating the\r\nestrangements of a generation.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter explains my absence from the Senate\r\nwhen Judge Lamar's death was announced:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 29, 1893\r\n\r\n_My Dear Madam:_\r\n\r\nI was kept in bed, under the orders of my physician, the\r\nday the death of your husband was announced to the Senate.\r\nI regret exceedingly that I could not be in my place to express\r\nmy sense of the great public loss and my warm personal admiration\r\nfor his great qualities of intellect and of heart.  I served\r\nwith him in the House of Representatives for more than four\r\nyears, and in the Senate for more than eight years.  It was\r\na stormy and exciting time.  We differed widely on very grave\r\nquestions, and this difference was more than once very sharply\r\nmanifested in public; but the more I knew him, the more satisfied\r\nI became of the sincerity of his patriotism, of his profound\r\nand far-sighted wisdom, of the deep fountain of tenderness\r\nin his affectionate and simple heart, and of his brave and\r\nchivalrous quality of soul.  I was more than once indebted\r\nto him for very great kindness indeed, under circumstances\r\nwhen I do not think he supposed it would ever come to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome of his judgments on the Supreme Bench are characterized\r\nby marvellous beauty and felicity of style.  He maintained\r\nhis place on that great tribunal to the satisfaction of his\r\nfriends and that admiration of his countrymen, in spite of\r\nfailing health and of the fact that the best years of his life\r\nhad been given to other studies than that of the law.\r\n\r\nIt is a good omen for our country that the friends and disciples\r\nof Charles Sumner unite with the people of Mississippi in\r\ntheir reverence for this noble and manly character.\r\n\r\n  I am faithfully yours,\r\n  GEORGE F. HOAR\r\n  Mrs. Lamar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nSOME SOUTHERN SENATORS\r\n\r\nAnother most delightful Democrat, with whom it was my pleasure\r\nto form quite intimate relations, was Senator Howell E. Jackson\r\nof Tennessee.  He had been in the Confederate service.  I\r\nthink he did not approve Secession, but like most others who\r\ndwelt in the South, thought his allegiance primarily due to\r\nhis State.  He was an admirable lawyer, faithful, industrious,\r\nclear-headed and learned in the law.  He had been a Whig before\r\nthe war, and, like other Southern Whigs, favored a moderate\r\nprotective tariff.  He was anxious to have the South take\r\nher place as a great manufacturing community, for which her\r\nnatural resources of iron and coal and her great water power\r\ngave her such advantages.  He was opposed to the Republican\r\nmeasures of Reconstruction and to placing the negro on a political\r\nequality with the whites.  But he also discountenanced and\r\ncondemned any lawless violence or fraud.\r\n\r\nSenator Jackson was appointed Judge of the United States Circuit\r\nCourt by President Cleveland.  He held that office when a\r\nvacancy on the Bench of the Supreme Court came by the death\r\nof Justice Lamar.  The election of 1892 had resulted in the\r\nchoice of President Cleveland.  The Democrats in the Senate\r\nwere determined that no Republican who should be nominated\r\nby President Harrison should be confirmed, and did not mean,\r\nif they could help it, that the place should be filled during\r\nthe December session.  The only way to get such a confirmation\r\nwould be for the Republican majority to put the question ahead\r\nof all other subjects, to go into Executive session every\r\nday as soon as the Senate met, and remain there until the\r\njudgeship was disposed of.  The Democrats must then choose\r\nbetween defeating the Appropriation Bills, and compelling\r\nan extra session, which the in-coming Administration would\r\nnot like.  In order to do that, however, the small Republican\r\nmajority must hold together firmly, and be willing to take\r\nthe risk of an extra session.\r\n\r\nI called on President Harrison and urged upon him the appointment\r\nof Judge Jackson.  I represented that it was desirable that\r\nthere should be some Democrats upon the Bench, and that they\r\nshould be men who had the confidence of their own part of\r\nthe country and of the country at large; that Judge Jackson\r\nwas a man of admirable judicial quality; that he had the public\r\nconfidence in a high degree, and that it would be impossible\r\nfor the Democratic Party to object to his selection, while\r\nit would strengthen the Bench.  So I thought that even if\r\nwe could put one of our men there without difficulty, it would\r\nbe wise to appoint Jackson.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison was very unwilling, indeed, to take this\r\nview.  He answered me at first in his rough impulsive way,\r\nand seemed very unwilling even to take the matter into consideration.\r\nBut after a considerable discussion he asked me to ascertain\r\nwhether the Republicans would be willing, if he sent in a\r\nRepublican name, to adopt the course above suggested, and\r\ntransact no other business until the result was secured, even\r\nat the risk of defeating the Appropriation Bills and causing\r\nan extra session.  I went back to the Senate and consulted\r\na good many Senators.  Nearly all of them said they would\r\nnot agree to such a struggle; that they thought it very undesirable\r\nindeed; that the effect would be bad.  So it was clear that\r\nnothing could be accomplished in that way.  I went back to\r\nthe White House and reported.  I got the authority of the\r\ngentlemen I had consulted to tell the President what they\r\nsaid.  The result was the appointment of Judge Jackson, to\r\nthe great satisfaction of the country.  He was a very industrious\r\nand faithful Judge.  But his useful life came to an end soon\r\nafterward, I suppose largely as the result of overwork in his\r\nimportant and laborious office.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General said of Mr. Justice Jackson:  \"He was\r\nnot so much a Senator who had been appointed Judge, as a Judge\r\nwho had served for a time as a Senator.\"\r\n\r\nI served with Senator Jackson on the Committee on Claims,\r\nand on the Committee on the Judiciary.  We did not meet often\r\nin social life.  He rarely came to my room.  I do not remember\r\nthat I ever visited him in his home.  But we formed a very\r\ncordial and intimate friendship.  I have hardly known a nature\r\nbetter fitted, morally or intellectually, for great public\r\ntrusts, either judicial or political, than his.  In the beginning,\r\nI think the framers of the Constitution intended the Senate\r\nto be a sort of political Supreme Court, in which, as a court\r\nof final resort, the great conflicts which had stirred the\r\npeople, and stirred the Representatives of the people in the\r\nlower House, should be decided without heat and without party\r\nfeeling.  It was, I have been told, considered a breach of\r\npropriety to allude to party divisions in early debates in\r\nthe Senate, as it would be now deemed a breach of propriety\r\nto allude to such divisions in the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHowell E. Jackson had this ancient Senatorial temperament.\r\nHe never seemed to me to be thinking of either party or section\r\nor popular opinion, or of the opinion of other men; but only\r\nof public duty.\r\n\r\nHe never flinched from uttering and maintaining his opinions.\r\nHe never caressed or cajoled his political antagonists.  It\r\nis a great tribute to his personal quality that he owed his\r\nelection as Senator to his political opponents who, when his\r\nown party was divided, joined a majority of his party to elect\r\nhim.  He also, as has been said, owed his appointment as Associate\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court to the impression which his probity\r\nand ability had made on his political opponents.  When sick\r\nwith a fatal illness he left a sick bed to take his place\r\nupon the Bench at the call of duty when the Income Tax case\r\nwas to be decided.  There is no doubt that the effort hastened\r\nhis death.  I do not agree with the conclusion to which he\r\ncame on that great occasion.  But the fact that he came to\r\nthat conclusion is enough to make me feel sure that there\r\nwere strong reasons for it, which might well convince the\r\nclearest understanding, and be reconciled with the most conscientious\r\ndesire to do right.\r\n\r\nNo list of the remarkable Senators of my time would be complete\r\nwhich did not contain the name of Senator Vest of Missouri.\r\nHe was not a very frequent speaker, and never spoke at great\r\nlength.  But his oratoric powers are of a very high order.\r\nOn some few occasions he has made speeches, always speaking\r\nwithout notes, and I suppose without previous preparation\r\nso far as expression and style go, which have very deeply\r\nmoved the Senate, though made up of men who have been accustomed\r\nto oratory and not easily stirred to emotion.  Mr. Vest is\r\na brave, sincere, spirited and straightforward man.  He has\r\na good many of the prejudices of the old Southern Secessionist.\r\nI think those prejudices would long ago have melted away in\r\nthe sunshine of our day of returning good feeling and affection,\r\nbut for the fact that his chivalrous nature will not permit\r\nhim to abandon a cause or an opinion to which he has once\r\nadhered, while it is unpopular.  He is like some old cavalier who\r\nsupported the Stuarts, who lived down into the days of the\r\nHouse of Hanover, but still toasted the King over the water.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting characters with whom it has been\r\nmy fortune to serve is Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia.\r\nOur ways of life, and in many particulars our ways of thinking,\r\nare far apart.  But I have been led to form a great respect\r\nfor his intellectual qualities, and for his sincere and far-\r\nsighted patriotism.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel came into the Senate in 1887.  He had been known\r\nas a very eminent lawyer at the Virginia Bar, author of two\r\nexcellent law books.  He had served a single term in the National\r\nHouse of Representatives.  He had won a National reputation\r\nthere by a very beautiful and brilliant speech at the completion\r\nof the Washington Monument.  There were two notable orations\r\nat the time, one by Mr. Daniel and one by Robert C. Winthrop.\r\nThese gentlemen were selected for the purpose as best representing\r\ntwo sections of the country.  Mr. Winthrop was, beyond all\r\nquestion, the fittest man in the North for such a task.  I\r\nhave a special admiration for the spirit and eloquence with\r\nwhich he performed such duties.  To my mind no higher praise\r\ncould be given Mr. Daniel's address than that it is worthy\r\nof that company.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to look at Mr. Winthrop's address some little\r\ntime ago, and, opening the volume containing it in the middle,\r\nI read a page or two with approval and delight thinking it\r\nwas Mr. Winthrop's.  But I found, on looking back to the beginning\r\nthat it was Senator Daniel's.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel speaks too rarely in the Senate.  He is always\r\nlistened to with great attention.  He speaks only on important\r\nquestions, to which he always makes an important contribution.\r\nHe has the old-fashioned Virginia method of speech, now nearly\r\npassed away,--grave, deliberate, with stately periods and\r\nsententious phrases, such, I suppose, as were used in the\r\nConvention that adopted the Constitution, or in that which\r\nframed or revised the Constitution of Virginia.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel was a Confederate soldier.  He is a Virginian\r\nto his heart's core.  He looks with great alarm on the possibility\r\nthat the ancient culture and nobility of the South, and the\r\nlofty character of the Virginian as he existed in the time\r\nof Washington and Marshall and Patrick Henry may be degraded\r\nby raising what he thinks an inferior race to social or even\r\npolitical equality.\r\n\r\nBut he retains no bitterness or hate or desire for revenge\r\nby reason of the conflict of the Civil War.  He delivered an\r\naddress before the President of the United States, the Supreme\r\nCourt, the representatives of foreign Governments, the two\r\nHouses of Congress and the Governors of twenty-one States\r\nand Territories, on the 12th of December, 1900, on the occasion\r\nof the celebration of the Centennial Anniversary of establishing\r\nthe seat of Government at Washington.  That remarkable address\r\nwas full of wise counsel to his countrymen.  Coming from a\r\nrepresentative of Virginia, who had borne arms and been badly\r\nwounded in the Civil War, it had a double value and significance.\r\nMr. Daniel declared the cheering and hopeful truth that great\r\nraces are made of a mixture of races, and that the best and\r\nbravest blood of the world's great races is mixed in the\r\nAmerican.  He appealed eloquently to the circumstances which\r\nshould stir the heart of the whole people to a new and loftier\r\nlove of country.  He pointed out that the differences in forty-\r\nfive great Commonwealths are not greater than ought to be\r\nexpected, and indeed not greater than is healthy.  He pointed\r\nout the National strength, the power of our great Republic\r\nstands at the dawn of a new century, with every man under\r\nits flag a freeman and ready to defend it.  He called upon\r\nhis countrymen to stand by the Monroe Doctrine, to be ready\r\nto defend it, if need be, in arms.  He then specially appealed\r\nto the people to foster the inventive genius of the country,\r\nand repeated Mr. Jefferson's lofty prophecy that in some future\r\nday--\r\n\r\n\"The farthest star in the heavens will bear the name of Washington,\r\nand the city he founded be the Capital of the universal Republic.\"\r\n\r\nIsham G. Harris entered the Senate the same day I did.  I\r\ncounted him always among my friends, although we had some\r\nsharp passages.  I cannot describe him better than by reprinting\r\nhere what I said of him in the Senate after his death.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, the great career of Senator Harris is well\r\nknown to his countrymen.  He has been for more than a generation\r\na striking and conspicuous figure in our public life.  His\r\ncolleague, his successor, the men of his own political faith,\r\nthe people of the great State which he served and honored\r\nand loved so long, will, each in their own way, portray his\r\ncharacter and record their esteem and affection.\r\n\r\n\"My tribute must be that of a political opponent.  So far\r\nas I have been able to exert any influence upon the history\r\nof my country during the long conflict now happily past, it\r\nhas been in opposition to him, to the party to which he belonged,\r\nto the opinions which he held, I am sure, quite as zealously\r\nand conscientiously as I hold my own.\r\n\r\n\"We entered the Senate on the same day.  He was a Southerner,\r\na Democrat and a Confederate.  I was born and bred in New\r\nEngland, a Republican, and an Abolitionist.  We rarely spoke\r\nin the same debate except on different sides.  Yet I have\r\nno memory of him that is not tender and affectionate, and\r\nthere is nothing that I can honestly say of him except words\r\nof respect and of honor.\r\n\r\n\"He was a typical Southerner.  He had the virtues and the\r\nfoibles that belonged to that character in the generation\r\nthe last of whom are now passing from the stage of public\r\naction.  He was a man of very simple and very high qualities.\r\nHe was a man of absolute frankness in public behavior and\r\nin private dealing.  The thought that was in his heart corresponded\r\nabsolutely with the utterance of his lips.  He had nothing\r\nto conceal.  I was about to say he was a man without the gift\r\nof diplomacy; but he was a man with the gift of the highest\r\ndiplomacy--directness, simplicity, frankness, courage--qualities\r\nwhich make always their way to their mark and to their goal\r\nover all circumlocutions and ambiguities.\r\n\r\n\"He was a man of brief, clear and compact speech.  He would\r\nsum up in a few vigorous and ringing sentences the argument\r\nto which other men would give hours or days.  He had an instinct\r\nfor the hinge or turning point of a debate.\r\n\r\n\"He was a man of absolute integrity and steadfastness.  What\r\nhe said, that he would do.  Where you left him, there, so\r\nlong as he lived, you would find him when you came back.\r\nHe was a man of unflinching courage.  He was not afraid of\r\nany antagonist, whether in the hall of debate or on the field\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\n\"He was an acknowledged master of parliamentary law, a system\r\nupon which not only the convenient procedure of legislative\r\nbodies largely depends, but which has close relations to Constitutional\r\nLiberty itself.  How often a few simple and clear sentences\r\nof his have dispersed the clouds and brought order out of\r\nconfusion in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n\"His great legislative experience made him invaluable as\r\na servant of his own State, of the country and as a counsellor\r\nto his younger associates.\r\n\r\n\"He was a pleasant man in private intercourse.  He had great\r\nsense of humor, a gift of portraiture, a good memory.  So\r\nhe brought out of the treasure-house of his varied experience\r\nabundant matter for the delight of young and old.  There is\r\nno man left in the Senate who was better company in hours\r\nof recreation.\r\n\r\n\"His influence will be felt here for a long time.  His striking\r\nfigure will still seem to be hovering about the Senate Chamber,\r\nstill sitting, still deliberating, still debating.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, it is delightful to think how, during the\r\nlives of the men who took part in the great conflict which\r\npreceded and followed the Civil War and the greater conflict\r\nof the war itself, the old bitterness and estrangements are\r\nall gone.  Throughout the whole land the word 'countryman'\r\nhas at last become a title of endearment.  The memory of the\r\nleaders of that great conflict is preserved as tenderly by\r\nthe men who fought with them as by the men who followed them.\r\nMassachusetts joins with Tennessee in laying a wreath on the\r\ntomb of her great soldier, her great Governor, her great Senator.\r\nHe was faithful to truth as he saw it; to duty as he understood\r\nit; to Constitutional Liberty as he conceived it.\r\n\r\n\"If, as some of us think, he erred, his error was that of a\r\nbrave man ready to give life and health and hope to the unequal\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n  To his loved cause he offered, free from stain,\r\n  Courage and faith; vain faith and courage vain.\r\n\r\n\"And, Mr. President, when he returned to his allegiance,\r\nhe offered to the service of his reunited country the same\r\nzeal and devotion he had given to the Confederacy.  There\r\nwas no reserved or half-hearted loyalty.  We could have counted\r\non his care for the honor and glory of his country, on his\r\nwise and brave counsel, in this hour of anxiety, with an unquestioning\r\nconfidence.  So Massachusetts to-day presses the hand of Tennessee\r\nand mourns with her for her great citizen who has departed.\"\r\n\r\nJames B. Eustis of Louisiana was of old Massachusetts stock.\r\nHis father was graduated at Harvard, and went to New Orleans,\r\nwhere he acquired great distinction at the bar, and as Chief\r\nJustice of that State.  Senator Eustis's great-uncle was General\r\nEustis, an eminent solider of the Revolutionary War, and afterward\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSenator Eustis seemed somewhat indolent, and to take very\r\nlittle interest indeed in what was going on, except on some\r\nfew occasions when he bore himself in debate with remarkable\r\nability.  I think his grave, scholarly style, and his powerful\r\nreasoning, the propriety, dignity and moderation with which\r\nhe dealt with important subjects, made him nearly the finest\r\nexample of Senatorial behavior I have ever known.  He once\r\nmade a speech in Executive session, on a topic which was suggested\r\nsuddenly and he could not have anticipated, on the character\r\nand history of French diplomacy, which was marvellous alike\r\nfor his profound and accurate knowledge of the subject and\r\nthe beauty and grace of his discourse.\r\n\r\nI was not intimate with him in Washington.  But I met him\r\nin Paris, while he was Ambassador there under President Cleveland's\r\nAdministration.  I have delightful memories of his hospitality,\r\nespecially of one breakfast, where there was but one other\r\nguest beside myself, in a beautiful room overlooking the Seine\r\nand the Place de la Concorde.\r\n\r\nIf I were to select the one man of all others with whom I\r\nhave served in the Senate, who seems to me the most perfect\r\nexample of the quality and character of the American Senator,\r\nI think it would be Edward C. Walthall of Mississippi.  I\r\nknew him personally very little.  I do not now remember that\r\nI ever saw him, except in the Capitol, or in the Capitol grounds.\r\nI had, I dare say, some pleasant talks with him in the Senate\r\nChamber, or the cloak room.  But I remember little of them\r\nnow.  He rarely took part in debate.  He was a very modest\r\nman.  He left to his associates the duty of advocating his\r\nand their opinions, unless he was absolutely compelled by\r\nsome special reason to do it himself.  When he did speak the\r\nSenate listened to a man of great ability, eloquence and dignity.\r\nI once heard him encounter William M. Evarts in debate.  Evarts\r\nmade a prepared speech upon a measure which he had in charge.\r\nWalthall's reply must have been unpremeditated and wholly\r\nunexpected to him.  I think Evarts was in the right and Walthall\r\nin the wrong.  But the Mississippian certainly got the better\r\nof the encounter.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable truth, which impresses itself upon me more\r\nand more the longer I live, that men who are perfectly sincere\r\nand patriotic may differ from each other on what seem the\r\nclearest principles of morals and duty, and yet both sides\r\nbe conscientious and patriotic.  There is hardly a political\r\nquestion among the great questions that have excited the American\r\npeople for the last half century on which we did not differ\r\nfrom each other.  The difference was not only as to the interpretation\r\nof the Constitution, and the welfare of the people, but seemed\r\nto go down to the very roots of the moral law.\r\n\r\nYet what I have just said about him is without exaggeration.\r\nI have the right to believe that he entertained the kindliest\r\nand most cordial feeling of regard for me.  Not long before\r\nhe died, President McKinley sent for me to come to the White\r\nHouse.  He wished to talk with me about what he should do\r\nin dealing with Cuba.  He was then holding back the popular\r\nfeeling, and resisting a demand which manifested itself among\r\nRepublicans in both Houses of Congress for immediate and vigorous\r\naction which would without doubt have brought on the war with\r\nSpain without delay.  He hoped then that the war might be\r\navoided.  I had to go to the Capitol before complying with\r\nthe President's request, as it was shortly before the time\r\nfor the session.  As I was leaving the Capitol to go to the\r\nWhite House, I met Senator Walthall.  He said, \"You seem to\r\nbe going the wrong way this morning,\" or something like that.\r\nI said, \"Yes, I am going to see the President.\" Senator Walthall\r\nsaid;  \"I wish you would be good enough to say to him from\r\nme that he may depend upon the support of the Democrats in\r\nthe Senate, with only one or two exceptions,\" whom he named,\r\n\"to support him in his efforts to avoid war, and to accomplish\r\na peaceful solution of the difficulties in regard to Cuba.\"\r\nI undertook to give the message.  And just as we were parting,\r\nSenator Walthall turned and said to me that he wished to tell\r\nme how highly he regarded me, and how sensible he was, notwithstanding\r\nmy very strong Northern feeling, of my appreciation of the\r\ncharacter of the Southern people, and my desire to do them\r\nfull justice.  He added that he regarded it one of the most\r\npleasant things that had happened to him in life that he had\r\nhad the pleasure of serving with me.  I do not now remember\r\nthat I ever spoke to him again.  He did not come to the Senate\r\nChamber very often afterward.  I have thought since that this\r\nunwonted expression of deep feeling from a gentleman not\r\nwont to wear his heart upon his sleeve toward his political\r\nopponent, and a man with whom he so often disagreed, was\r\ndue to a premonition, of which he was perhaps unconscious,\r\nthat the end of his life was near, and to the kindly and\r\ngentle emotions which in a brave and affectionate heart like\r\nhis the approach of death is apt to bring.\r\n\r\nI could hardly venture to repeat this story, to which there\r\nis no other witness than my own, but for some letters in my\r\npossession from Mr. Walthall's daughter and friends in which\r\nthe writers quote even stronger expressions of his regard.\r\n\r\nI heard a great deal of him from Senator Lamar, who loved\r\nhim as a brother, and almost worshipped him as a leader.  Senator\r\nLamar told me that he thought Walthall the ablest military\r\ngenius of the Confederacy, with the exception of Lee, and,\r\nI think, of Stonewall Jackson.  Indeed, I think he expressed\r\ndoubt whether either exception could be made.  He said that\r\nif anything had happened to Lee, Walthall would have succeeded\r\nto the chief command of the Confederate forces.  General Walthall\r\nseemed to me the perfect type of the gentleman in character\r\nand speech.  He was modest, courteous and eager to be of service\r\nto his friends or his country.  The description of the young\r\nKnight given us by Chaucer, the morning star of English poetry,\r\nstill abides as the best definition of the gentleman.\r\n\r\n  Curteis he was, lowly and serviceable.\r\n\r\nHis colleague, Mr. Williams of Mississippi, after Walthall's\r\ndeath, described the Southern gentleman of our time in a sentence\r\nwhich deserves to stand by the side of Chaucer's:\r\n\r\n\"The ideal gentleman was always honest; spoke the truth;\r\nfaced his enemy; fought him, if necessary; never quarrelled\r\nwith him nor talked about him; rode well; shot well; used\r\nchaste and correct English; insulted no man--bore no insult\r\nfrom any; was studiously kind to his inferiors, especially\r\nto his slaves; cordial and hospitable to his equals; courteous\r\nto his superiors, if he acknowledged any; he scorned a demagogue,\r\nbut loved his people.\"\r\n\r\nI do not undertake to draw his portraiture.  I suppose that\r\nwhoever does that must describe a great soldier and a great\r\nlawyer, as well as a great Senator.  I only state what I saw\r\nof him in the Senate Chamber.  It was said of him by an eminent\r\nRepublican Senator, his associate on the Committee on Military\r\nAffairs, that in dealing with questions which affected the\r\nright of Union soldiers, or growing out of service to the\r\nUnion during the Civil War, no stranger could have discovered\r\non which side of that great war he had ranged himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nCUSHMAN KELLOGG DAVIS\r\n\r\nI reprint here a paper read before the American Antiquarian\r\nSociety shortly after Mr. Davis's death.\r\n\r\nCushman Kellogg Davis was born at Henderson, Jefferson County,\r\nNew York, June 16, 1838, and died at St. Paul, Minnesota,\r\nNovember 27, 1900.  On his mother's side he was descended\r\nfrom Robert Cushman and Mary Allerton, the last survivor of\r\nthe company which came over in the Mayflower.  He was graduated\r\nat the University of Michigan in 1857, and admitted to the\r\nBar shortly before the breaking out of the Civil War.  He\r\nenlisted at the beginning of the War and served as First Lieutenant\r\nof Company B, Eighth Wisconsin Regiment, until 1864, when\r\nhe was compelled by physical infirmity to resign his commission.\r\nHe was an excellent soldier.  He sustained an injury to one\r\nof his eyes, which caused him much pain through life, until\r\na few years before his death he lost the sight of that eye\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from the war, he began the practice of the\r\nlaw anew, in which he gained great distinction.  For many\r\nyears, and until his death, he was the acknowledged leader\r\nof the Bar of his State.  He was a member of the State Legislature\r\nof Minnesota in 1867, United States District Attorney from\r\n1868 till 1873, and Governor of the State in 1874 and 1875.\r\nHe was one of the Regents of the State University of Minnesota\r\nfrom 1892 to 1898.  In 1887 he was elected United States Senator,\r\nand reelected in 1893 and 1899.  He held the office of Senator\r\nuntil his death.  He was Chairman of the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations from March, 1897, till his death.  He was one of\r\nthe Commissioners who negotiated the Treaty of Paris with\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nHe was a great lover of books, of which he had a costly collection.\r\nHe knew Shakespeare very thoroughly, and was the author of\r\na book called \"The Law of Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nHe was also a zealous and thorough student of the career\r\nof Napoleon, whose civic and military career he greatly admired.\r\nHis mind was a marvellous storehouse of literary gems which\r\nwere unknown to most scholars, but rewarded his diligent search\r\nand loving study of his books.\r\n\r\nMany good stories are told by his companions of the Bar and\r\nin public life of his apt quotations.  It is said that he\r\nonce defended a Judge in an impeachment case.  The point involved\r\nwas the power of the court to punish for contempt, and Davis\r\nquoted in support of his position the splendid and well-known\r\nlines of Henry the Fourth, in the famous scene where the Chief\r\nJustice punishes the Prince of Wales for contempt of the judicial\r\noffice and authority.  For this anecdote, the writer is indebted\r\nto Senator Lodge.  In the Senate, during the Hawaiian debate,\r\nhe quoted this passage from Juvenal:\r\n\r\n  Sed quo cecidit sub crimine; quisnam\r\n  Delator? quibus judiciis; quo teste probavit?\r\n  Nil horum; verbosa et grandis epistola venit\r\n  A Capreis.  Bene habet; nul plus interrogo.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"My friend from Massachusetts (Mr. Hoar) requests me to translate\r\nthat.  He does not need it, of course. But another Senator\r\n(Mr. Washburn) suggests that some of the rest of us do.  I\r\nwill not attempt to give a literal translation, but I will\r\ngive an accurate paraphrase, which will show its application.\r\n'Into what crime has he fallen? By what informer has he been\r\naccused?  What judge has passed upon him? What witness has\r\ntestified against him? Not one or any of these.  A verbose\r\nand turgid message has come over from Capri.  That settles\r\nit.  I will interrogate no further.'\"\r\n\r\nThe most ardent admirers of the then President, Mr. Cleveland,\r\ncould not help joining in the laugh.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis took great delight in his descent from the early\r\nsettlers of Plymouth, and valued exceedingly the good will\r\nof the people of Massachusetts.  The members of the Society\r\nwho were fortunate enough to meet him will not forget their\r\ndelight in his pleasant companionship, when he visited Massachusetts\r\na few years ago to attend our meeting and contribute a paper\r\nto our Proceedings.  He had hoped to repeat the visit.\r\n\r\nI prefer, instead of undertaking to complete this imperfect\r\nsketch by a new portraiture of my honored friend, to add what\r\nI said in the Senate, when the loss of Mr. Davis was still\r\nrecent:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President:  There is no Senator who would not be glad\r\nto lay a wreath of honor and affection on the monument of\r\nCushman K. Davis.  That, however, is more especially the right\r\nof his colleague and his successor and the members of the\r\ngreat Committee where he won so much of his fame.  I ought\r\nto say but a few words.\r\n\r\n\"The Senate, as its name implies, has been from the beginning,\r\nwith few exceptions, an assembly of old men.  In the course\r\nof nature many of its members die in office.  That has been\r\ntrue of thirty-eight Senators since I came to the Capitol.\r\nOthers, a yet larger number, die soon after they leave office.\r\nOf the men with whom I have served in this Chamber fifty-\r\neight more are now dead, making in all ninety-six, enough\r\nand to spare to organize another Senate elsewhere.  To that\r\nnumber has been added every Vice-President but two.  Upon\r\nthose who have died in office eulogies have been pronounced\r\nin this Chamber and in the House.  The speakers have obeyed\r\nthe rule demanded by the decencies of funeral occasions--nil\r\nde mortuis nisi bonum--if not the command born of a tenderer\r\npity for human frailty--jam parce sepulto.  But in general,\r\nwith scarcely and exception, the portraitures have been true\r\nand faithful.  They prove that the people of the American\r\nStates, speaking through their legislative assemblies, are\r\nnot likely to select men to represent them in this august\r\nassembly who are lacking in high qualities either of intellect\r\nor of character.  However that may be, it is surely true of\r\nMr. Davis that whatever has been or will be said of him to-\r\nday, or was said of him when the news of his death first shocked\r\nthe country, is just what would have been said when he was\r\nalive by any man who knew him.  I have served with him here\r\nnearly fourteen years.  I have agreed with him and I have\r\ndiffered from him in regard to matters of great pith and moment\r\nwhich deeply stirred the feelings of the people, as they did\r\nmine, and doubtless did his own.  I never heard any man speak\r\nof him but with respect and kindness.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Mr. President, in this great century which is\r\njust over, when our Republic--this infant Hercules--has been\r\ngrowing from its cradle to its still youthful manhood, the\r\ngreatest place for a live man has been that of a soldier\r\nin time of war and that of a statesman in time of peace.\r\nCushman K. Davis was both.  He did a man's full duty in both.\r\nNo man values more than I do the function of the man of letters.\r\nNo man reveres more than I do the man of genius who in a loving\r\nand reverent way writes the history of a great people, or\r\nthe poet from whose lyre comes the inspiration which induces\r\nheroic action in war and peace.  But I do not admit that the\r\ntitle of the historian or that of the poet to the gratitude\r\nand affection of mankind is greater than that of the soldier\r\nwho saves nations, or that of the statesman who creates or\r\npreserves them, or who makes them great.  I have no patience\r\nwhen I read that famous speech of Gladstone, he and Tennyson\r\nbeing together on a journey, when he modestly puts Mr. Tennyson's\r\ntitle to the gratitude of mankind far above his own.  Gladstone,\r\nthen Prime Minister, declared that Tennyson would be remembered\r\nlong after he was forgotten.  That may be true.  But whether\r\na man be remembered or whether he be forgotten; whether his\r\nwork be appreciated or no; whether his work be known or unknown\r\nat the time it is accomplished, is not the test of its greatness\r\nor its value to mankind.  The man who keeps this moral being,\r\nor helps to keep this moral being we call a State in the paths\r\nof justice and righteousness and happiness, the direct effect\r\nof whose action is felt in the comfort and happiness and moral\r\nlife of millions upon millions of human lives, who opens and\r\nconstructs great highways of commerce, who makes schools and\r\nuniversities not only possible but plenty, who brings to pass\r\ngreat policies that allure men from misery, and poverty, and\r\noppression, and serfdom in one world, to free, contented,\r\nhappy, prosperous homes in another, is a great benefactor\r\nto mankind, whether his work be accomplished with sounding\r\nof trumpets, or stamping of feet, or clapping of hands, or\r\nthe roar and tumult of popular applause, or whether it be\r\ndone in the silence of some committee room, and no man know\r\nit but by its results.\r\n\r\n\"I am not ready to admit that even Shakespeare worked on a\r\nhigher plane, or was a greater power on earth, than King Alfred\r\nor George Washington, even if it be that he will survive them\r\nboth in the memory of man.  The name of every man but one\r\nwho fought with Leonidas at Thermopylae is forgotten.  But\r\nis AEschylus greater than Leonidas, or Miltiades, or Themistocles?\r\nThe literature of Athens preserves to immortality the fame\r\nof its great authors.  But it was Solon, and Pericles, and\r\nMiltiades that created and saved and made great the city,\r\nwithout which the poets could not have existed.  Mr. Tennyson\r\nhimself came nearer the truth than his friend, Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwhen he said:\r\n\r\n  He\r\n  That, through the channels of the state,\r\n  Conveys the people's wish, is great;\r\n  His name is pure; his fame is free.\r\n\r\n\"There have been soldiers whose courage saved the day in great\r\ndecisive battles when the fate of nations hung in the scale,\r\nyet whose most enduring monument was the column of smoke which\r\nrose when their death shot was fired.  There have been statesmen\r\nwhose silent influence has decided the issue when the country\r\nwas at the parting of the ways, of whose service history takes\r\nno heed.  The great Ohio Territory, now six imperial States,\r\nwas twice saved to freedom by the almost unnoticed action\r\nof a single man.  With all respect for the man of letters,\r\nwe are not yet quite ready to admit that the trumpeter is\r\nbetter than the soldier, or the painter greater than the lion.\r\n\r\n\"There is no need of many words to sum up the life and character\r\nof Cushman Davis.  His life was in the daylight.  Minnesota\r\nknew him.  His country knew him and loved him.  He was a good\r\nsoldier in his youth, and a great Senator in his maturer manhood.\r\nWhat can be said more, or what can be said better, to sum\r\nup the life of an American citizen? He offered his life for\r\nhis country when life was all before him.  His State and his\r\ncountry rewarded him with their highest honor.  The great\r\norator and philosopher of Rome declared in his youth, and\r\nrepeated in his age, that death could not come prematurely\r\nto a man who had been Consul.  This man surely might be accounted\r\nready to die.  He had discharged honorably life's highest\r\nduty, and his cup of honor and of glory was full.\r\n\r\n\"We are thinking to-day of something more than a public sorrow.\r\nWe are mourning the loss of a close and delightful companionship,\r\na companionship which lightened public care and gave infinite\r\npleasure to private intercourse.  If he had never held office,\r\nif his name had never been heard even beyond the boundaries\r\nof a single municipality, he would have been almost anywhere\r\na favorite and foremost citizen.  He was, in the first place,\r\nalways a gentleman; and a true gentleman always gives tone\r\nto any company in which he is found, whether it be among the\r\nrulers of States or the humblest gathering of friendly neighbors.\r\nLord Erskine said on a great occasion:\r\n\r\n\"'It is impossible to define in terms the proper feelings\r\nof a gentleman; but their existence has supported this country\r\nfor many ages, and she might perish if they were lost,'\r\n\r\n\"Certainly our friend had this quality.  He was everywhere\r\na gentleman.  He met every occasion in life with a simple\r\nand quiet courtesy.  There was not much of deference in it.\r\nThere was no yielding or supplication or timidity in it.  I\r\ndo not think he ever asked favors, though no man was more\r\nwilling to grant them.  But there is something more than this\r\nin the temper of which I am speaking.  The man who possesses\r\nit gives unconsciously to himself or his associates tone to\r\nevery circle, as I just said, in which he is found.  So, wherever\r\nhe was, his manner or behavior prevailed, whatever might have\r\nhappened to the same men if they had been left alone.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Davis was a man who kept well his own counsel.  He\r\nwas a man to whom it was safe for other men to trust their\r\ncounsel.  His conversation, to which it was always a delight\r\nto listen, had no gossip in it.  Still less had it ever anything\r\nof ill nature or sarcasm.  He liked to share with a friend\r\nthe pleasure he took in finding some flower or gem of literature\r\nwhich, for long ages till he found it in some out-of-the-\r\nway nook, had--\r\n\r\n  Blushed unseen,\r\n  And wasted its sweetness on the desert air.\r\n\r\n\"He had what Jeremy Taylor calls, 'the great endearment of\r\nprudent and temperate speech.'\r\n\r\n\"His conversation was sparkling and witty and full of variety,\r\nbut no spark from him was ever a cinder in the eye of his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"He had a learning rare among public men, and, for its variety,\r\nrare, I think, among scholars.  He would bring out bits of\r\nhistory, full of interest and instruction, from the most obscure\r\nsources, in common conversation.  He was an excellent Latin\r\nscholar.  He had read and mastered Tacitus, and a man who\r\nhas mastered Tacitus has had the best gymnastic training of\r\nthe intellect, both in vigor and style, which the resources\r\nof all literature can supply.\r\n\r\n\"One secret of his great popularity with his companions here--\r\na popularity I think unexcelled, indeed, I incline to think\r\nunequalled by that of any other man with whom I have served--\r\nis that to which the late Justin Morrill owed so much.  He\r\nnever debated.  He rarely answered other men's arguments,\r\nnever with warmth or heat.  But he was exceedingly tenacious\r\nof his own opinion.  He was, in the things he stood for, as\r\nunyielding as flint and true as steel.  But his flint or steel\r\nnever struck out a spark by collision with any other.  He\r\nspoke very rarely in debate in general; only when his official\r\nplace on his committee, or something which concerned his own\r\nconstituents especially, made speaking absolutely imperative.\r\nThen he gave his opinion as a judge gives it, or as a delegate\r\nto some great international council might be supposed to give\r\nit; responsible for it himself, but undertaking no responsibility\r\nfor other men's opinion or conduct; never assuming that it\r\nwas his duty or within his power to convert, or change, or\r\ninstruct them, still less to chastise them.  Whether that\r\nway be the best way for usefulness in a deliberative body,\r\nespecially in a legislative body of a great popular government,\r\nI will not undertake now to say.  Certainly it is not the\r\ncommon way here or elsewhere.  It is very rare indeed, that\r\nany man possessing the great literary and oratorical power\r\nof Mr. Davis, especially a man to whom nobody ever thought\r\nof imputing timidity or undue desire to enjoy public favor,\r\nor want of absolute confidence in his own opinions, will be\r\nfound to refrain from employing these qualities to persuade\r\nor convince other men.\r\n\r\n\"He had a rare and exquisite gift which, if he had been a\r\nman of letters and not a man engaged in a strenuous public\r\nlife, would have brought him great fame.  Once in a while\r\nhe said something in private, and more rarely, though once\r\nor twice, in a public speech, which reminded you of the delicate\r\ntouch of Hawthorne.  His likening President Cleveland and\r\nMr. Blount, looking upon the late royalty of the Sandwich\r\nIsland with so much seriousness, to Don Quixote and Sancho\r\nPanza taking in great earnest the spectacle of a theatrical\r\nrepresentation at a country fair and eager to rescue the distressed\r\ndamsel, was one of the most exquisite felicities of the literature\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\n\"He had great pride in his ancestry, and was a great lover\r\nof the history of New England and Plymouth, from which they\r\ncame, though he never gave himself airs on account of it.\r\nHe was a descendant of Robert Cushman, the preacher of the\r\nPilgrims, whose service was in a thousand ways of such value\r\nto the little colony at Plymouth.  Yet it had never happened\r\nto him to visit the scenes with which the feet of his ancestors\r\nhad been so familiar, until a few years ago he did me the\r\nhonor to be my guest in Massachusetts, and spent a few days\r\nin visiting her historic places.  He gazed upon Boston and\r\nPlymouth and Concord reverently as ever Moslem gazed upon\r\nMecca or the feet of palmer stood by the holy sepulchre.  That\r\nweek to him was crowded with a delight with which few other\r\nhours in his life could compare.  I had hoped that it might\r\nbe my fortune and his that he might visit Massachusetts again,\r\nthat her people might gather in their cities to do him honor,\r\nand might learn to know him better, and might listen to the\r\nsincere eloquence of his voice.  But it was ordered otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"There are other things his country had hoped for him.  She\r\nhad hoped a longer and higher service, perhaps the highest\r\nservice of all.  But the fatal and inexorable shaft has stricken\r\nhim down in the full vigor of a yet strenuous manhood.  The\r\ngreat transactions in which he had borne so large a part still\r\nremain incomplete and their event is still uncertain.\r\n\r\n\"There is a painting which a great Italian master left unfinished.\r\nThe work was taken up and completed by a disciple.  The finished\r\npicture bears this inscription:  'What Titian left unfinished,\r\nPalma reverently completed, and dedicated to God.' So may\r\nour beloved Republic find always, when one servant leaves\r\nhis work unfinished, another who will take it up and dedicate\r\nit to the country and to God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nGEORGE BANCROFT\r\n\r\nOne of the most delightful friendships of my life was with\r\nGeorge Bancroft, the famous historian.  I never knew him\r\nuntil I went to Washington in 1877.  But we established at\r\nonce, as a matter of course, the relation of an intimate friendship.\r\nHe was born in Worcester, to which he was much attached, though\r\nhe had spent little of his life there after he had left college.\r\nMrs. Bancroft had known my oldest brother and sister intimately,\r\nwhen she lived in Boston.  I had learned from Mr. Emerson,\r\nwho rarely gave his praise lightly, as well as from my own\r\nstudy, to value Mr. Bancroft very highly as a historian,\r\nwhich he soon found out.\r\n\r\nI almost always found him waiting for me on the doorstep\r\nof my dwelling when I came from church the first Sunday after\r\nI reached Washington, at the beginning of a session.  I have\r\nenjoyed many hours at his table, rendered delightful by the\r\nconversation of the eminent guests whom he gathered there,\r\nbut by no conversation more delightful than his own.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft had two enthusiasms which made him a great historian--\r\nan enthusiasm for truth which spared no labor and left no\r\nstores of information unsearched, and an enthusiastic love\r\nof country.  He believed that the great emotions and motives\r\nwhich move a free people are the noble, not the mean motives.\r\nHe has written and interpreted the history of the United States\r\nin that faith.  I believe his work will endure so long as\r\nthe love of liberty shall endure.  I gave my estimate of him\r\nat a meeting of the American Antiquarian Society, of which\r\nwe were both chosen Vice-Presidents, in October, 1880, just\r\nafter the completion of his eightieth year and of his \"History\r\nof the United States,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is not usual to discuss the report of the committee to\r\npropose a list of officers.  But one of the names reported\r\ngives special interest to the occasion.  On the third of this\r\nmonth of October, our honored associate Mr. Bancroft completed\r\nhis eightieth year.  At the same time he completed his 'History\r\nof the United States' to the formation of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"This Society, while it is national and continental in the\r\nscope of its investigations, strikes down its roots into the\r\nsoil of this locality, where its founder dwelt, and where its\r\ncollections are kept.\r\n\r\n\"For both these reasons we cherish our relations to Mr. Bancroft.\r\nHe was born within a few rods of this spot.  He is descended\r\nby the mother's side from an old Worcester County family who\r\nwere conspicuous in the administration of its public affairs\r\nlong before the Revolution.  His father was one of the six\r\npersons who petitioned for the act of incorporation of this\r\nSociety, and one of its first members.  His brother by marriage,\r\nGovernor Davis, was your predecessor in the President' chair.\r\n\r\n\"These reasons would be enough to induce us to value our relation.\r\nBut he has filled a highly honorable and conspicuous place\r\nin public life.  He is, I believe, the senior person living\r\nwho has been a member of the Cabinet.  He is the senior among\r\nliving persons who have filled important diplomatic stations.\r\nHe has represented the United States at Berlin and at St. James.\r\n\r\n\"His history is, and doubtless will be, the great standard\r\nauthority upon the important period which it covers.  He\r\nis the only person living whose judgment would change the\r\nplace in public estimation held by any of the great statesmen\r\nof the Revolutionary times.  He has had the rare good fortune\r\namong men of letters, to have proposed to himself a great\r\ntask, requiring a lifetime for its accomplishment, the successful\r\nachievement of which is enough to make any life illustrious,\r\nand to have lived to complete it with powers of body and mind\r\nundiminished.  It is his fate to know, while alive, the estimate\r\nin which he will be held by posterity.  In his case, that\r\nknowledge can be only a source of pleasure and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"In this Mr. Bancroft resembles Gibbon.  We all remember\r\nGibbon's delightful account of the completion of his great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"In another thing, alone among great historians, Mr. Bancroft\r\nresembles Gibbon.  As an artist he has accomplished that most\r\ndifficult task of composing a history made up of many separate\r\nthreads, which must keep on side by side, yet all be subordinate\r\nto one main and predominant stream.  But his narrative never\r\nloses its constant and fascinating interest.  No other historian,\r\nI believe, except Gibbon, has attempted this without becoming\r\ninsufferably dull.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bancroft tells the story of thirteen States, separate,\r\nyet blending into one National life.  It is one of the most\r\nwonderful things in our history, that the separate States\r\nhaving so much in common, have preserved so completely, even\r\nto the present time, their original and individual characteristics.\r\nRhode Island, held in the hollow of the hand of Massachusetts;\r\nConnecticut, so placed that one would think it would become\r\na province of New York; Delaware, whose chief city is but\r\ntwenty-five miles from Philadelphia, yet preserve their distinctive\r\ncharacteristics as if they were states of the continent of\r\nEurope, whose people speak a different language.  This shows\r\nhow perfectly state rights and state freedom are preserved\r\nin spite of our National union, how little the power at the\r\ncentre interferes with the important things that affect the\r\ncharacter of a people.  Why is it that little Delaware remains\r\nDelaware in spite of Pennsylvania, and little Rhode Island\r\nremains Rhode Island notwithstanding her neighbor Massachusetts?\r\n\r\n  What makes the meadow flower its bloom unfold?\r\n  Because the lovely little flower is free\r\n  Down to its roots, and in that freedom bold.\r\n  And so the grandeur of the forest tree\r\n  Comes, not from casting in a formal mould,\r\n  But from its own divine vitality.\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Bancroft is more fortunate than Gibbon.  Gibbon wrote\r\nof decline, of decay, of dissolution, and death; of the days,\r\nto use his own words, 'when giants were becoming pigmies.'\r\nBancroft tells the story of birth, and growth, and youth,\r\nand life.  His name is to be inseparably associated with a\r\ngreat and interesting period in the world's history; with\r\nwhat in the proud imagination of his countrymen must ever\r\nbe the greatest and most interesting of all periods, when\r\npigmy villages were becoming giant States.  I am sure that\r\nit is a delight to this assembly of distinguished scholars,\r\nassembled near his birthplace, to send him, at the completion\r\nof his great work, and of his eightieth year, their cordial\r\nsalutation.\"\r\n\r\nI went to see Mr. Bancroft on the evening of the last Sunday\r\nin December, 1890.  He was sitting in his library up stairs.\r\nHe received me in his usual emphatic manner, taking both my\r\nhands and saying, \"My dear friend, how glad I am to see you!\"\r\nHe was alone.  He evidently knew me when I went in, and inquired\r\nabout Worcester, as he commonly did, and expressed his amazement\r\nat its remarkable growth.\r\n\r\nI stayed with him about twenty or thirty minutes.  The topics\r\nof our conversation were, I believe, suggested by me, and\r\nthe whole conversation was one which gave evidence of full\r\nunderstanding on his part of what we were talking about.  It\r\nwas not merely an old man's memory of the past, but the fresh\r\nand vigorous thought on new topics which were suggested to\r\nhim in the course of the conversation.  I think he exhibited\r\na quickness and vigor of thought and intelligence and spoke\r\nwith a beauty of diction that no man I know could have surpassed.\r\n\r\nI asked him if he could account for the interest in historical\r\nstudy among the older Harvard graduates, and mentioned the\r\nfact that the principal historians of this country, including\r\nhimself, Prescott, Sparks, Motley, Palfrey and Parkman, were\r\nall Harvard men and were eminent at a time when there were\r\nscarcely any other eminent historical scholars in America.\r\nHe did not directly answer this question, but said that his\r\nown inclination toward history, he thought, was due very much\r\nto the influence of his father.  He said his father would\r\nhave been a very eminent historian, if he had had material\r\nat his command, and that he had a remarkably judicious mind.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of some clergymen, especially the Unitarian clergymen,\r\nso many of whom belonged to Harvard at his time.  He said\r\nhe had little sympathy for the Unitarianism of his day, \"for\r\nits theology, no; for its spirituality, yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked me about the Election Bill pending in the Senate.\r\nI spoke of the great storm of abuse I had had to encounter\r\nfor advocating it, but said I thought on the whole the feeling\r\nbetween the different sections of the country and different\r\npolitical parties was better than it ever had been before\r\nin this country, and much better than that which now existed\r\nbetween different political parties in foreign countries.\r\nHe cordially agreed to this, and made some observations which\r\nI do not now recall, but which were interesting and bright.\r\n\r\nAfter we had talked together for some time, he said:  \"My\r\nmemory is very poor:  I cannot remember your first name.\"\r\nI said:  \"It is the same as yours, Mr. Bancroft--George.\"\r\nHe paused a moment with an amused and puzzled look, and said:\r\n\"What is your last name?\"  He had evidently known me very\r\nwell during most of the preceding part of the interview.\r\n\r\nI told his son about this conversation the day after Mr.\r\nBancroft's death.  He said that the presence of a visitor\r\nacted in this way as a stimulant, but that he had not lately\r\nshown much intelligence in the family, seeming lost and feeble.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nVISITS TO ENGLAND\r\n[1860, 1868, 1871]\r\n\r\nI was born within a mile of the spot where the War of the\r\nRevolution began.  My ancestors and other kindred on both\r\nsides took an active and prominent part in the struggle with\r\nEngland.  I am descended from the early Puritans of Massachusetts\r\nin every line of descent.  So it will readily be believed\r\nthat all my feeling and sympathy have been on the side of\r\nmy country in the great controversy with England, which began\r\nwith the exile of the Pilgrims in 1620 and continued, with\r\nlittle interruption, until our last great quarrel with her,\r\nwhich ended with the arbitration at Geneva.  Yet I am a passionate\r\nlover of England.  Before I ever went abroad, I longed to\r\nvisit the places famous in her history, as a child longs to\r\ngo home to his birthplace.\r\n\r\nI have visited Europe six times.  On each occasion I devoted\r\nthe largest part of my time to Great Britain.  The desire\r\nto see England again has increased with every visit.  Certainly\r\nthere is nothing like England, and there never has been anything\r\nlike England in the world.  Her wonderful history, her wonderful\r\nliterature, the beauty of her architecture, the historic and\r\npoetic associations which cluster about every street and river\r\nand mountain and valley, her vigorous life, the sweetness\r\nand beauty of her women, the superb manhood of her men, her\r\nnavy, her gracious hospitality, her courage and her lofty\r\npride--although some single race of people may have excelled\r\nhere in a single particular--make up a combination never equalled\r\nin the world.  I am, of course, not to be understood to bring\r\nmy own country into the comparison.\r\n\r\nThe first time I went abroad was in 1860.  I had for a companion\r\nmy friend from infancy, George M. Brooks, of Concord.  We\r\ntravelled like a couple of Bohemians, never riding where we\r\ncould walk; lunching or dining where he happened to find ourselves\r\nwhen we were hungry; taking second or third class carriages\r\non the railroads, and getting into conversation with anybody\r\nwho would talk to us.  I doubt whether I shall ever have in\r\nthis world, or in another, a sensation more delicious than\r\nthat I had when the old steamer, \"America,\" steamed up the\r\nChannel toward the mouth of the Mersey, with the green shores\r\nof Ireland on one side and England on the other.  I am afraid\r\nif I were to relate the story of that journey, it would be\r\nonly to please myself by reviving its recollections, and not\r\nfor the delight of my readers, so many of whom have a similar\r\nmemory of their own.\r\n\r\nWe heard John Bright and Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston\r\nin a great debate in the House of Commons on the paper duties,\r\nand saw Lord Brougham walking backward and forward on the\r\nterrace by Brougham Castle, near Penrith.  We saw Edinburgh\r\nand the Trosachs, and Abbotsford and Stirling.  I had been\r\na loving reader of Scott from my childhood, and was almost\r\nas much at home in Scotland as if I had been born in the Canongate\r\nor the Saltmarket.  I had had a special fancy for reading\r\nand studying topographical books on London, and found myself,\r\npretty soon, so much at home there that I think I could have\r\nmade a very decent living as a guide.\r\n\r\nWe spent a month in Switzerland.  I made the journey over\r\nthe mountain passes on foot, keeping up with my companion,\r\nwho had a horse or a mule.  I could walk twenty-five or thirty\r\nmiles a day without great fatigue.\r\n\r\nAugustus Flagg of the famous book-selling firm of Little\r\n& Brown, with whom I had dealt a great deal, was on the\r\nship when I went out.  He went abroad to purchase books for\r\nhis house.  In those days the book-stalls in London were mines\r\nof rare treasures.  They had not been much examined by collectors\r\nor dealers, and the men who kept them did not know the value\r\nof books that were almost priceless in the eyes of virtuosos.\r\nMr. Flagg and I spent together a good many days in ransacking\r\nthe old book-stalls and shops, some of them in out-of-the-\r\nway places in the old city, even below the Tower.  I could\r\nnot afford to buy a great many books then.  But I knew something\r\nabout them, and the experience was like having in my hands\r\nthe costliest rubies or diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe journey each way, which now takes six or seven days, then\r\ntook fourteen.  The Cunard steamer, whose successor, with\r\nits bilge keel and its vastly greater size, is as comfortable,\r\neven in very rough weather, as the first class city hotel,\r\nwas as disagreeable in rough weather, to a man unaccustomed\r\nto the ocean, as a fishing smack.  But the passengers got\r\nwell acquainted with one another.  There was agreeable society\r\non board, and the days passed pleasantly.\r\n\r\nAmong the passengers was Joseph Coolidge of Boston, father\r\nof Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, late Minister to France.  Mr.\r\nCoolidge had been a great traveller in his day; had had some\r\ncommercial occupations in the East, and was very pleasant\r\ncompany.  His wife was a granddaughter of Mr. Jefferson.\r\nHe told me that two of Mr. Jefferson's daughters--or granddaughters,\r\nI am not now absolutely sure which--had kept school and earned\r\nmoney, which they had applied to the payment of Mr. Jefferson's\r\ndebts.  The story was highly creditable to these Virginia\r\nladies, who might well have thought that their illustrious\r\nancestor's service might excuse his family from making sacrifices\r\nin discharge of such an obligation, if his countrymen at large\r\ndid not feel its force.\r\n\r\nI went over pretty much the same ground in 1868 with three\r\nladies.  I made both these journeys as an ordinary sightseer.\r\nI took few letters of introduction.  I did not deliver those,\r\nexcept in one or two cases to American gentlemen living abroad.\r\n\r\nOne experience in this latter journey, however, it may be\r\nworth while to tell.  I had a very pleasant friendship with\r\nHenry T. Parker, a Boston man and a graduate of Harvard,\r\nwho had a comfortable property and had married an English\r\nlady and had settled in London.  He found an occupation,\r\ncongenial to his own taste, in buying books, as agent of some\r\nof the great libraries in the United States, including the\r\nHarvard Library and the Boston City Library.  He was an intimate\r\nfriend of Mr. Cox, the accomplished Librarian of the Bodleian,\r\nto whom he gave us letters.\r\n\r\nMr. Cox treated us with special courtesy and showed us many\r\ntreasures of the Library, especially some wonderful illuminated\r\nmanuscripts.  One of them, the Duc de Monpensier, who had\r\nbeen at Oxford shortly before and who was an authority in\r\nsuch matters, felt confident was illustrated by Raphael.  Mr.\r\nCox had discovered, just before I was there, in some crypt\r\nwhere it had lain unknown for two hundred years, a touching\r\nletter from Clarendon, who was Chancellor of the University,\r\nwhich I think will move the heart of every man who loves the\r\ncollege where he was educated.  The letter was written by\r\nLord Clarendon just after he had landed at Calais, a hopeless\r\nexile, on his last flight from the country to which he was\r\nnever again to return.  The great orator, statesman, historian,\r\nlawyer, judge,--counsellor, companion and ancestor of monarchs,--\r\nflying for his life, in his old age, into a foreign land,\r\nfrom the court of which, for a generation, he had been the\r\nornament and head, soon as his feet touch a place of safety,\r\nthinks of his University.  See the noble heart through the\r\nsimple and stately rhetoric:\r\n\r\nGOOD MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR;\r\n\r\nHaving found it necessary to transport myselfe out of England,\r\nand not knowing when it shall please God that I shall returne\r\nagaine, it becomes me to take care that the University may\r\nnot be without the service of a person better able to be of\r\nuse to them than I am like to be, and I doe therefore hereby\r\nsurrender the office of chancellor into the hand of said University,\r\nto the end that they may make choyce of some other person\r\nbetter qualified to assist and protect them, than I am.  I\r\nam sure he can never be more affectionate to it.  I desire\r\nyou as the last suite I am likely to make to you, to believe\r\nthat I doe not fly my country for guilt, and how passionately\r\nsoever I am pursued, that I have not done anything to make\r\nthe University ashamed of me, or to repent the good opinion\r\nthey had once of me, and though I must have no mention in\r\nyour publique devotions, (which I have always exceedingly\r\nvalued,) I hope I shall always be remembered in your private\r\nprayers, as\r\n\r\n  Good Mr. Vice-Chancellor,\r\n  Your affectionate servant,\r\n  CLARENDON.\r\n  CALAIS, this 7-17 Dec., 1667.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 I went abroad alone.  I spent the whole time in England,\r\nexcept for a brief visit to Scotland.  My purpose in going\r\naway was to get a vacation.  I meant to do some studying in\r\nthe British Museum, especially to make a thorough study of\r\nthe conditions and economic principles affecting the strife\r\nbetween capital and labor, which then threatened both this\r\ncountry and England.  I got a collection of the authorities\r\nand the references.  But I did not find that I got a great\r\ndeal of light from anything that had been written or said\r\nso far.  I made a few very agreeable acquaintances.  I had\r\na letter to Thomas Hughes, and visited at his house.  I found\r\nGeorge W. Smalley, who had been a pupil in my office, established\r\nin a delightful house near London.  He seemed to be on terms\r\nof intimacy with the famous Englishmen who were the leaders\r\nof both political parties, and with many eminent men of letters.\r\nI spent a delightful evening with Mr. Hughes at a club which\r\nI think was called the European Club, or something like that,\r\nwhere the members smoked clay pipes and drank beer.  There\r\nseemed to be no other provision for the refreshment of the\r\nbody or soul.  But the conversation was very pleasant.  The\r\nmembers sat together about a table, and the conversation was\r\nquite general and very bright.  The talk turned, during the\r\nevening, on Scotsmen.  The Englishmen present seemed to have\r\nsomething left of the old prejudice about Scotland with which\r\nDr. Johnson was possessed.  They imputed to the modern Scotsmen\r\nthe same thrifty habit and capacity for looking after himself\r\nthat prevailed a hundred years before, when Dr. Johnson and\r\nJohn Wilkes, who quarrelled about everything else, became\r\nreconciled when they united in abuse of their Northern neighbors.\r\nSir Frederick Pollock cited a marginal note from the report\r\nof some old criminal case, to the following effect: \"Possession\r\nof property in Scotland evidence of stealing in England.\"\r\n\r\nI was guilty of one piece of stupid folly.  Mr. Hughes kindly\r\nproposed to take me to see Carlyle.  This was not very long\r\nafter our war, when our people were full of indignation at\r\nCarlyle's bitter and contemptuous speech about us, especially\r\nhis \"American Iliad in a Nutshell.\"  I was a little doubtful\r\nabout what sort of a reception I should get, and declined\r\nthe invitation.  I have bitterly regretted this ever since.\r\nMy brother visited Carlyle about 1846, bearing with him a\r\nletter from Emerson.  Carlyle was very civil to him, and liked\r\nhim very much, as appears by a letter from him to Mr. Emerson.\r\n\r\nDuring the visit I heard a great debate between Gladstone\r\nand Disraeli.  A brief account of it will be found in the\r\nchapter on \"Some Famous Orators I have Heard.\"\r\n\r\nA friend in Worcester gave me a letter to Mr. Wornum, the\r\nDirector of the National Gallery, with whom he had been a\r\nfellow-pupil at Kensington.  Mr. Wornum received me with great\r\ncordiality.  He asked me to come to the Gallery the next\r\nday, when it would be closed to the public.  He said he would\r\nbe glad to show it to me then, when we would be free of interruption.\r\nHe was the author of what I understand to be an excellent\r\nhistory of painting, and was regarded as the most competent\r\njudge in Europe of the value and merit of paintings.  I suppose\r\nParliament would at any time, on his sole recommendation,\r\nhave given ten or twenty or perhaps fifty thousand guineas\r\nfor a masterpiece.  I shall never forget the delight of that\r\nday.  He told me the history of the great paintings in the\r\nNational Gallery, some of which had belonged to monarchs,\r\npopes, noblemen or famous merchants of almost all the countries\r\nin Europe.  He said that while there were many larger galleries,\r\nthe National Gallery was the best in the world as affording\r\nthe best and most characteristic examples of every school\r\nof painting.  I cannot remember much that was said in that\r\nlong day, interrupted only by a pleasant lunch together.  But\r\nit was a day full of romance.  It was as if I had had in my\r\nhand the crown jewels of every potentate in the world, and\r\nsomebody had told me the history of each gem.  For this picture\r\nFrancis the First, or Charles V., or Henry VIII. had been\r\nbidders.  This had belonged to Lorenzo de Medici, or Pope\r\nLeo X.  This had come from the famous collection of Charles\r\nI., scattered through Europe on his death; and this had belonged\r\nto some nobleman whose name was greater than that of monarchs.\r\n\r\nMr. Wornum spoke of his treasures with an enthusiasm which\r\nno worshipper at the throne of any Saint or Divinity could\r\nsurpass.  That day was among the few chiefest delights of\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nVISITS TO ENGLAND\r\n1892\r\n\r\nMy next visit to England was in the spring of 1892.  The\r\nwinter before, I had a severe attack of iritis, which left my\r\neyes in a very demoralized condition.  I did not find much\r\nrelief in this country, not, I suppose, because of want of\r\nskill in our ophthalmic surgeons, but because of the impossibility\r\nof getting any rest anywhere where I could be reached by telephone\r\nor telegraph.  To a person who can bear an ordinary voyage\r\nthere is no retreat like an ocean steamer.  Telephone, telegraph,\r\ndaily paper; call or visit of friend, client, or constituent;\r\ndaily mail--sometimes itself, to a busy public man, enough\r\nfor a hard day's work--all these are forgotten.  You spend\r\nyour ten days in an infinite quiet like that of Heaven.  You\r\nsit in your deck-chair with the soft sea breeze on your forehead,\r\nas the mighty ocean cradle rocks you, and see the lace of\r\nan exquisite beauty that no Tyrian weaver ever devised, breaking\r\nover the blue or purple waves, with their tints that no Tyrian\r\ndye ever matched.  Ah! Marconi, Marconi, could not you let\r\nus alone, and leave the tired brain of humanity one spot\r\nwhere this \"hodge-podge of business and trouble and care\"\r\ncould not follow us and find us out?\r\n\r\nOn this journey I visited England, France and Switzerland.\r\nIt so happened that I had had a good deal to do with the appointment\r\nof our Ministers to these three countries.  Colonel John D.\r\nWashburn, a very accomplished and delightful gentleman, now\r\ndead, had been a pupil of mine as a law student.  He lived\r\nin Worcester and had been a very eminent member of the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature.  I think he would have been Governor of the State\r\nand had a very brilliant career but for a delicacy of organization\r\nwhich made him break down in health when under any severe\r\nstrain of responsibility, especially such as involved antagonism\r\nand conflict.  He was of a very friendly, gentle disposition,\r\nand disliked to be attacked or to attack other men.  I told\r\nMr. Blaine, the Secretary of State when Mr. Harrison's Administration\r\ncame in, that I had but one favor to ask of it; that was,\r\nthat he should send Washburn as Minister to Switzerland.  I\r\nhad two or three very pleasant days with him at Berne.  But\r\nhe had sent his family away and was preparing to resign his\r\nplace.  So I had not much opportunity of seeing Switzerland\r\nunder his guidance.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson Coolidge, then Minister to France, had also\r\nbeen appointed on my very earnest recommendation.  He was\r\na great-grandson of Thomas Jefferson, a very able business\r\nman, highly esteemed throughout the country.  His guidance\r\nwas implicitly followed by many people in important business\r\ntransactions.  He had had the charge of the financial affairs\r\nof some large manufacturing corporations, and was understood\r\nto have extricated the Northern Pacific Railroad out of some\r\nserious difficulties, into which it fell again after he left\r\nits control.  He had been a Democrat.  But he had seen the\r\nimportance of the protective policy to American interests,\r\nas would naturally be expected of a descendant of that high\r\nprotectionist, Thomas Jefferson.  He had no sympathies with\r\nany measures that would debase or unsettle the currency, and\r\nset his face and gave his powerful influence against all forms\r\nof fiat or irredeemable paper money, and the kindred folly\r\nof the free coinage of silver by this country alone, without\r\nthe concurrence of the commercial nations of the world.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Harrison's Administration began, I received\r\na message about nine o'clock one evening, asking me to go\r\nto the White House at once.  I obeyed the summons.  The President\r\nsaid he desired, if I had no objection, to send in the name\r\nof Dr. Loring of Massachusetts, as Minister to Portugal.  I\r\ntold him that I had no objection whatever; that Dr.  Loring\r\nwas an able man of agreeable manners, and had performed admirably\r\nevery public duty he had undertaken.  I said that the Doctor\r\nhad felt a little disturbed, I thought, that I had refused\r\nto call a meeting of the Massachusetts delegation to press\r\nhis name upon the President for a Cabinet office, to which\r\nPresident Harrison replied, \"I put my foot on that pretty\r\nquick.\"  Dr. Loring had been a great friend and supporter\r\nof Mr. Blaine, the Secretary of State.  I conjectured, although\r\nthe President did not say so, that the choice of Dr. Loring\r\nhad been made at the Secretary's instance.\r\n\r\nThe President then said that he wanted to talk with me about\r\nthe English Mission, which had troubled him a good deal.  He\r\nmentioned the names of several prominent men in different\r\nparts of the country, including Robert Lincoln and Mr. Jewett,\r\nan eminent lawyer in Chicago, whose name was earnestly pressed\r\nupon him by the Senators from Illinois.  I said that I had\r\nknown Mr. Lincoln pretty well when he was in President Garfield's\r\nand Mr. Arthur's Cabinet, and thought very highly of him.\r\nHe was a very modest man indeed, never pressing any claim\r\nto public consideration or office, either on his own account\r\nor as his father's son, and never seeking responsibility.\r\nBut I had noticed that when he had anything to say or anything\r\nto do, he always said or did the wisest and best thing to be\r\nsaid or done under the circumstances.  I do not know how\r\nmuch influence what I said had, but it seemed to gratify\r\nPresident Harrison exceedingly, and he stated that he was\r\nstrongly inclined to appoint Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nI was told the next morning he sent for the two Illinois\r\nSenators, and told them that he had made up his mind to nominate\r\nMr. Lincoln, and that one of them, Senator Farwell, was exceedingly\r\noffended.  He was also much disturbed by President Harrison's\r\nattitude in regard to the appointment of the postmaster at\r\nChicago.  The result was that when President Harrison's name\r\ncame up for another nomination, Mr. Farwell was opposed to\r\nhim, and when he was with difficulty nominated for reelection,\r\nthe State of Illinois voted for Cleveland.  Senator Cullom,\r\nthough not liking very well to have his opinion disregarded,\r\nwas more discreet.  He did not see fit to make the exercise\r\nof the President's rightful and Constitutional prerogative\r\na reason for breaking off his friendly relations with the\r\nAdministration, with whose principles he was in full accord.\r\nThis is an instance of President Harrison's want of tact.\r\nI have little doubt that if, before finally announcing his\r\nintention, he had sent for the Illinois Senators--as Abraham\r\nLincoln would have done, or as President McKinley would have\r\ndone--gone over the whole ground with them, and told them\r\nhis reasons and desire, they would have cheerfully acquiesced\r\nin the conclusion to which he had come, and their friendship\r\nwith him would have been strengthened and not weakened.\r\n\r\nAfter saying what was to be said about the English Mission,\r\nI said to President Harrison:  \"We have a gentleman in Massachusetts,\r\nwhom I think it is very desirable indeed to place in some\r\nimportant public service; that is Thomas Jefferson Coolidge.\r\nHe is a great-grandson of Mr. Jefferson.\" I said to the President\r\nthe substance of what I have just stated above, about Mr.\r\nCoolidge.  I added that while Mr. Coolidge would be an excellent\r\nperson for the English Mission, which his uncle Mr. Stevenson\r\nhad held, yet, of course, I did not think, under the circumstances,\r\nthat it would be proper to make another important diplomatic\r\nappointment from Massachusetts just then; but I hoped that\r\nan opportunity might come later.  President Harrison seemed\r\nto be much impressed with the suggestion, and said that he\r\nwould bear it in mind.\r\n\r\nWhen I went back to my room, it occurred to me that I had better\r\nspeak to Mr. Blaine about it.  If he first heard of it from\r\nthe President he might think that I was trying to deal with\r\nthe President about matters in his Department over his head\r\nand without consulting him.  So I went round to the State\r\nDepartment early the next morning, and told Mr. Blaine what\r\nI had said to the President.  I found that he knew all about\r\nMr. Coolidge.  I inadvertently spoke of him as grandson of\r\nMr. Jefferson.  Blaine immediately corrected me by saying,\r\n\"great-grandson.\"  He seemed to like the plan very well.\r\n\r\nNothing came of the matter at that time.  But later, when\r\nthe Pan-American Commission was appointed, the President,\r\nof his own motion, appointed Mr. Coolidge as one of the American\r\nrepresentatives.  Later, I happened to be one day at the White\r\nHouse, and President Harrison told me that Whitelaw Reid had\r\nannounced his intention of resigning the French Mission before\r\nlong.  I reminded him of our conversation about Mr. Coolidge,\r\nand urged his name very strongly on him.  He hesitated a good\r\ndeal.  I got the approval of every New England Senator but\r\none to the proposal.  The President still hesitated and seemed\r\ninclined to appoint Mr. Andrew D. White.  But he finally\r\nyielded to the urgency for Mr. Coolidge.  I should have been\r\nsorry if anything I had done had resulted in depriving the\r\ncountry of the service of Andrew D. White.  I suppose him\r\nto be one of the very best representatives we ever had abroad.\r\nBut an opportunity came soon after, to send him first to\r\nRussia, and then to Germany, where he has represented what is\r\nbest in the character, ability, desire, interest and scholarship\r\nof the American people.\r\n\r\nSo we had two first-rate representatives abroad instead of\r\none.  Mr. Coolidge discharged his functions to the satisfaction\r\nof the Administration, and to the universal approval of his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nHe received me when I visited Paris with a very cordial and\r\ndelightful hospitality.  I had the pleasure of meeting at\r\nhis house at dinner M. Ribot, then Prime Minister of France\r\nand afterward President of the French Republic, and several\r\nothers of the leading men in their public life.  But I spoke\r\nFrench very imperfectly indeed, and understood it much less,\r\nwhen spoken by a Parisian.  The conversation was, in general,\r\nin French.  So I got very little knowledge of them by being\r\nin their society.\r\n\r\nMy visit in England gave me a good deal more to remember.\r\nMr. Lincoln also received me with great cordiality.  He gave\r\na dinner at which several of the leaders of the Liberal Party\r\nwere present; among them, Sir William Vernon Harcourt.  I\r\nhad letters to Sir William Vernon Harcourt, and to Lord Rosebery,\r\nand to Lord Coleridge, Lord Chief Justice of England.  Sir\r\nWilliam Vernon Harcourt and Lord Rosebery each called on me,\r\nand spent an hour at my room.  But Parliament was dissolved\r\njust at that time, so the Liberal leaders had at once to begin\r\nthe campaign which resulted in Mr. Gladstone's victory.  So\r\nI had no opportunity to make an intimate acquaintance with\r\neither of them.  I owed to Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes an introduction\r\nto John Bellows, a Quaker, a most delightful gentleman, the\r\nfirst authority in his time on the Roman antiquities of Great\r\nBritain, a fine classical scholar and learned in old English\r\nliterature and in the languages from which came the roots\r\nof our English tongue.  I formed with him a close friendship\r\nwhich ended only with his death, in 1902.  A year before he\r\ndied he visited me in my home at Worcester, and received the\r\ndegree of Master of Arts from Harvard.  Mr. Bellows is the\r\nauthor of the wonderful French Dictionary.\r\n\r\nI spent a few days with Lord Coleridge in Devon.  His house\r\nat Ottery St. Mary's is close to the spot where Samuel Taylor\r\nColeridge was born.  I met there several of the race.  I do\r\nnot know whether they were living in the neighborhood or happened\r\nto be there on a visit.\r\n\r\nI found in the church, close by, the tomb of John Sherman,\r\none of my own kindred, I have no doubt, of the race which\r\ncame from Colchester and Dedham in Essex, and Yaxley in Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chief Justice was much distressed lest he had done\r\nwrong in complying with General Butler's invitation to visit\r\nhim at Lowell.  He said that many of his American friends\r\nhad treated him coldly afterward, and that his friend Richard\r\nDana, whom he highly esteemed, had refused to call upon him\r\nfor that reason.\r\n\r\nI told him he did absolutely right, in my opinion.  I said\r\nthat General Butler was then Governor of the Commonwealth\r\nof Massachusetts, and that an eminent person, holding a high\r\nofficial character, from a foreign country, could not undertake\r\nto question the personal character, or the title to be considered\r\ngentlemen, of the men whom the American people put into their\r\nhigh places.\r\n\r\nLord Coleridge said he received fifty guineas every morning\r\nfor his services in the Tichborne trial.  \"But,\" he added,\r\n\"my general practice in my profession was so much interrupted\r\nby it that I could not have got along that year but for my\r\nsalary as Attorney-General.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with great pride of his cross-examination of the\r\nClaimant.  He said one of the papers had complained that\r\nhis cross-examination did no good to his case whatever.  \"But\r\nI made him admit that he sent his photograph to some person,\r\nas the photograph of Arthur Orton.\"  He said the common people\r\nin England still held to the belief that the Claimant was\r\nthe genuine Sir Roger Tichborne, and, by a curious contradiction,\r\nthis feeling was inspired largely by their sympathy with him\r\nas a man of humble birth.  I said, \"Yes, I think that is true.\r\nI heard somebody, a little while ago, say that they heard\r\ntwo people talking in the cars, and one of them said to the\r\nother, 'They wouldn't give him the estate, because he was\r\nthe son of a poor butcher.'\"  This very much amused the Lord\r\nChief Justice.\r\n\r\nI asked him about the story I had heard and had verified\r\nsome time before, of the connection, in the person of Lady\r\nRolle, between two quite remote periods.  Lady Rolle was\r\nalive until 1887, maintaining her health so that she gave\r\ndinner parties in that year, shortly before she died.  She was\r\nthe widow of Mr. Rolle, afterward Lord Rolle, who made a\r\nviolent attack on Charles James Fox in 1783.  He was then\r\nthirty-two years old.  From him the famous satire, the Rolliad,\r\ntook its name.  When he went to pay his homage to Queen Victoria\r\nat her Coronation in Westminster Abbey, he was quite feeble,\r\nand rolled down the steps of the throne.  The young Queen\r\nshowed her kindness of heart by jumping up and going to help\r\nhim in person.  Some of the English told the foreigners present\r\nat the ceremonial that that was part of the ceremony, and\r\nthat the Rolles held their lands on the tenure of going through\r\nthat performance at every coronation.  Lady Rolle was married\r\nto her husband in 1820.  He was then sixty-nine, and she a\r\nyoung girl of twenty years old.  He was eighty or ninety years\r\nold when he died, and she survived as his widow for many years.\r\nSomething came up on the subject of longevity which induced\r\nme to refer to this story and ask Lord Coleridge if it were\r\ntrue.  We were then riding out together; \"Yes,\" said he, \"there,\"\r\npointing to a dwelling-place in full sight, \"is the house\r\nwhere she lived.\"\r\n\r\nHis Lordship asked me about an American Judge with whom he\r\nhad some acquaintance.  I told him that I thought his reputation\r\nwas rather that of a jurist than a Judge.  \"Oh, yes,\" said\r\nhe, \"a jurist is a man who knows something about the law of\r\nevery country but his own.\"\r\n\r\nLord Coleridge had a good reputation as a story-teller.  It\r\nwas pleasant to get an auditor who seemed to like to hear\r\nthe stories which have got rather too commonplace to be worth\r\ntelling over here.  He had a great admiration for President\r\nLincoln, and was eager to hear anything anybody had to tell\r\nof him.  I told him the famous story of Lincoln's reply to\r\nthe man who had left with him his poem to read, when he gave\r\nit back.  \"If anybody likes that sort of thing, it's just\r\nthe sort of thing they'd like.\"  I overheard his Lordship,\r\nas he circulated about the room, a little while afterward,\r\nrepeating the story to various listeners.\r\n\r\nHe thought Matthew Arnold the greatest living Englishman.\r\nHe spoke with great respect of Carlyle.  He said: \"Emerson\r\nwas an imitator of Carlyle, and got his thoughts from him.\"\r\nI could not stand that.  It seemed to me that he had probably\r\nnever read a page of Emerson in his life, and had got his\r\nnotion from some writer for a magazine, before either of these\r\ngreat men was well known.  I took the liberty of saying, with\r\nsome emphasis, \"Emerson was a far profounder and saner intellect\r\nthan Carlyle.\"  To which he said, \"Why, what do you say?\"\r\nI repeated what I had said, and he received the statement\r\nwith great politeness, but, of course, without assent.\r\n\r\nDuring this summer I paid a visit to Moyle's Court, near\r\nSouthampton, formerly owned by Lady Alice Lisle, whose daughter\r\nmarried Leonard Hoar, President of Harvard College.  Leonard\r\nHoar was the brother of my ancestor, John Hoar of Concord,\r\nand the son of Charles Hoar, Sheriff of Gloucester.  There\r\nis a statement in an old account of some Puritan worthies\r\nthat I have seen, to the effect that John Hoar and Leonard\r\nmarried sisters.  If that be true, John Hoar's wife, Alice,\r\nwas a daughter and namesake of Lady Alice Lisle.  Although\r\nI should like to believe it, I am afraid that the claim cannot\r\nbe made good.  Lady Alice Lisle was a lady of large wealth\r\nand good lineage.  Her husband was John Lord Lisle, who was\r\nLord Justice under Cromwell, and one of the Judges in the\r\ntrial of Charles I.  He drew the indictment and sentence of\r\nthe King, and sat next to Bradshaw at the trial, and directed\r\nand prompted him in difficult matters.  He was murdered one\r\nSunday morning on his way to church when in exile at Lausanne,\r\nSwitzerland, on the Lake of Geneva, by three ruffians, said\r\nto be sent for that purpose by Queen Henrietta.  Lady Alice\r\nLisle was a victim of the brutality of Jeffries.  After Monmouth's\r\nrebellion and defeat, she gave shelter and food to two fugitives\r\nfrom Monmouth's army.  The report of her trial is in Howell.\r\nThere was no proof that she knew that they were fugitives\r\nfrom Monmouth's army, although she supposed one of them was\r\na Dissenting minister.  There had been no conviction of the\r\nprincipals, which the English law required before an accessory\r\nafter the fact could be found guilty.  She suggested this\r\npoint at the trial, but it was overruled by Jeffries.  He\r\nconducted the case with infinite brutality.  She was a kindly\r\nold lady, of more than seventy years.  She slept during part\r\nof the trial, probably being fatigued by the journey, in which\r\nshe had been carried on horseback from Moyle's Court to Winchester,\r\nand the sleepless nights which would naturally have followed.\r\nShe was sentenced to be burned at the stake.  But the sentence\r\nwas commuted to beheading, at the intercession of the gentry\r\nof the neighborhood.  She had disapproved of the execution\r\nof the King; said she had always prayed for him, and had a\r\nson in the King's army.  Macaulay's account of the story is\r\nfamiliar to all readers of English history.\r\n\r\nI was received at the old house with great kindness by Mrs.\r\nFane, wife of the present proprietor.  It is a beautiful\r\nold house with carved oak partitions, with a dining room\r\nrising to the roof.  Lady Lisle's chamber and the place where\r\nthe two fugitives were concealed are still shown.  Mrs. Fane\r\nhad gathered some local traditions which are not found in\r\nprint.  One old lady, who had been well known to persons now\r\nliving, had received some of them from her grandmother, who\r\nwas cotemporary with Lady Alice.\r\n\r\nThe lady was very popular with her tenants in the neighborhood.\r\nThe messenger who came from Winchester to arrest her took\r\nher on horseback behind him, according to the custom of the\r\ntime.  The horse cast a shoe.  The messenger was for pressing\r\non without regard to the suffering of the animal.  She insisted\r\nthat he should stop and have the horse shod.  The man roughly\r\nrefused.  She said:  \"I have made no outcry, on my own account.\r\nBut everybody here loves me.  If you do not stop, I shall\r\ncry out.  You will never get away with me alive.\" The fellow\r\nwas frightened and consented to stop at a smithy.  When the\r\nsmith had finished his work, Lady Lisle said: \"I will be back\r\nthis way in two or three days, and I will pay you.\"  To this\r\nthe messenger said:  \"Yes, you will be back this way in two\r\nor three days, but without your head.\"\r\n\r\nThe headless body was brought back from Winchester after the\r\ntrial.  The next day, when the household were at dinner, a\r\nman came to the outside and thrust into the dining room window\r\na basket, containing her head.  This was said to be for \"greater\r\nindignity.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lisle had known Hicks, one of the persons whom she relieved,\r\nbefore.  When the court was sitting for the trial of Charles\r\nI., she went up to London to expostulate with her husband.\r\nShe arrived at his lodgings just as he was setting out in\r\na procession, with some state, for Westminster Hall, where\r\nthe trial was held.  As she approached to speak to him, he\r\ndid not recognize her in the soiled dress in which she had\r\ntravelled, and motioned her away rather roughly.  It was said\r\nthat she was overcome by the press in the crowd and fell to\r\nthe ground.  Hicks, who was a Dissenting minister, raised\r\nher up and took her to his own lodging near by in the Strand.\r\nShe said to him that she could not recompense him there, but\r\nif he would come to Hampshire, or to the Isle of Wight, where\r\nshe had property, she would be glad to repay him.\r\n\r\nSaturday, October 22, 1892, with Mrs. Hoar and her sister,\r\nMrs. Rice, I went from Southampton to Ringwood, about twenty\r\nmiles, and thence drove to Ellingham Church, about two miles\r\nand a half.  The church is a small but very beautiful structure\r\nof stone, with a small wooden belfry.  The tomb of Lady Alice\r\nLisle is a heavy, flat slab of gray stone, raised about two\r\nor three feet from the ground, bearing the following inscription:\r\n\r\n  Here lies Dame Alicia Lisle\r\n  and her daughter Ann Harfeld\r\n  who dyed the 17th of Feb. 1703-4\r\n  Alicia Lisle dyed the\r\n  second of Sept. 1685.\r\n\r\nIt is close to the wall of the church, on the right of the\r\nporch.  In the church is seen the old Lisle pew of carved\r\noak, now the pew of the Earl of Normanton.  Opposite the\r\npew is the pulpit, also of carved black oak, apparently ancient.\r\nThe church contains a tablet to the memory of the former owner\r\nof Moyle's Court, who died in 1622.\r\n\r\nMoyle's Court is about a mile and a half from Ellingham Church.\r\nThe drive is along a beautiful lane shaded by trees whose\r\nbranches meet from the two sides, through a beautiful and\r\nfertile country, adorned by herds of fine cattle.  Moyle's\r\nCourt is a large two-story building, consisting of two square\r\nwings connected by the main building.  The wings project from\r\nthe main building in front, but the whole forms a continuous\r\nline in the rear.  As you approach it, you pass numerous\r\nheavy, brick outbuildings, including several farmhouses, one\r\nof which is quite large, and apparently of great antiquity.\r\nWe were received by Mrs. Fane with the greatest courtesy.\r\nShe said that the landed estate connected with Moyle's Court\r\nis very large, now or recently yielding the Earl of Normanton\r\nseven thousand pounds a year.\r\n\r\nThe present occupant of Moyle's Court, Frederick Fane, Esq.,\r\ncame there about twenty-one years before.  The house was then\r\nmuch dilapidated, but he has restored it in a style in keeping\r\nwith the ancient architecture.  The principal room is a dining\r\nhall, rising from the ground some twenty-five feet in height,\r\nwith a gallery at one end, on a level with the second story.\r\nThe walls of this room are of beautiful, carved oak, the front\r\nof the gallery being ancient, and as it existed in the time\r\nof Lady Alice Lisle.  The staircase, also of fine, carved\r\noak, is of equal antiquity.  The carved oak in the passages\r\nand some of the other rooms has been restored by Mr. Fane\r\nfrom material found in the attic.  There is also a curious\r\nold kitchen, with a large fireplace, with a closet in the\r\nchimney where it is said one of the persons succored by Lady\r\nAlice Lisle was found hidden.  In the cellar is a curiously\r\ncarved head on a stone beam, which seemed as if it might formerly\r\nhave supported a mantel-piece or shelf.  It is said that this\r\nportion of the cellar was once a chapel.\r\n\r\nSome of the chambers have been named by Mr. Fane from persons\r\nconnected with the tragedy--Dame Alicia, Monmouth, Nelthrop,\r\nHicks, Tryphena--these names being inscribed on the doors.\r\nThe room is shown where Lady Lisle is said to have been seized.\r\n\r\nThe old tombstone over the grave of Leonard Hoar and his wife,\r\nat the Quincy burial-ground, in Massachusetts, is almost an\r\nexact copy of that over Lady Alice Lisle, at Ellerton near\r\nMoyle's Court.  They were doubtless selected by the same taste.\r\nMrs. Leonard Hoar, whose maiden name was Bridget Lisle, was\r\nconnected quite intimately with three of the great tragedies\r\nin the history of English liberty.  Her father, as has been\r\nsaid, was murdered at Lausanne.  Her mother was murdered under\r\nthe form of the mock judgment of Jeffries, at Winchester.\r\nHer niece married Lord Henry Russell, son of the Duke of Bedford,\r\nand brother of Lord William Russell, the story of whose tragic\r\ndeath is familiar to every one who reads the noble history\r\nof the struggle between liberty and tyranny which ended with\r\nthe Revolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nBridget Hoar married again after the death of her husband,\r\nPresident Hoar.  Her second husband was a Mr. Usher, who\r\nseems to have been insane.  She lived with him very unhappily,\r\nthen separated from him and went back to England, staying\r\nthere until he died.  She then came back to Boston and died,\r\nMay 25, 1723.  At her own request she was buried at the side\r\nof her first husband.  A great concourse of the clergy and\r\nthe principal citizens, including the Governor, attended her\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to be instrumental, after this visit,\r\nin correcting an evil which had caused great annoyance to\r\nour representatives abroad for a good many years.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have never maintained their representatives\r\nabroad with a dignity becoming a great power like the United\r\nStates.  The American Minister is compelled by our rules to\r\nwear a dress which exposes him to be mistaken for a waiter\r\nat any festive gathering.  Distinctions of rank are well established\r\nin the diplomatic customs of civilized nations.  It is well\r\nunderstood that whether a representative of a county shall\r\nbe an Ambassador, a Minister Plenipotentiary, a Minister Resident,\r\nor a Charge' d'affaires, depends on the sense of its rank\r\namong the nations of the world of the country that sends him.\r\nFor many years all argument was lost on Congress.  The United\r\nStates representative must not adopt the customs as to dress\r\nof the effete monarchies of the old world.  To send an Ambassador\r\ninstead of a Minister was to show a most undemocratic deference\r\nto titles, abhorrent to every good republican.  There had\r\nbeen several attempts to make a change in this matter, always\r\nunsuccessful, until I went abroad in 1892.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in London in that year, I saw a great deal of\r\nMr. Lincoln.  He told me how vexatious he found his position.\r\nWhen the Minister for Foreign Affairs received the diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives of other countries at the Foreign Office,\r\nAmbassadors were treated as belonging to one rank, or class,\r\nand the Ministers as to a lower one.  The members of each\r\nclass were received in the order of their seniority.  We change\r\nour Ministers with every Administration.  So the Minister\r\nof the United States is likely to be among the juniors.  He\r\nmight have to wait all day, while the representatives of insignificant\r\nlittle States were received one after another.  If, before\r\nthe day ended, his turn came, some Ambassador would arrive,\r\nwho would get there, perhaps, five minutes before it was time\r\nfor Mr. Lincoln to go in, he had precedence at once.  So the\r\nrepresentative of the most powerful country on earth might\r\nhave to lose the whole day, only to repeat the same experience\r\non the next.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement was made which partly cured the trouble by\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs receiving Mr. Lincoln, on\r\nspecial application, informally, at his residence, on some\r\nother day.  But that was frequently very inconvenient.  And,\r\nbesides, it was not always desirable to make a special application\r\nfor an audience, which would indicate to the English Government\r\nthat we attached great importance to the request he might\r\nhave to make, so that conditions of importance would be likely\r\nbe attached to it by them.  It was quite desirable, sometimes,\r\nto mention a subject incidentally and by the way, rather than\r\nto make it matter of a special appointment.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to Paris, I found Mr. Coolidge complaining of the\r\nsame difficulty.  I told our two Ministers that when I got\r\nhome I would try to devise a remedy.  Accordingly I proposed\r\nand moved as an amendment to the Consular and Diplomatic Appropriation\r\nBill, the following clause:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever the President shall be advised that any foreign\r\ngovernment is represented, or is about to be represented in\r\nthe United States, by an Ambassador, Envoy Extraordinary,\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary, Minister Resident, Special Envoy,\r\nor Charge' d'affairs, he is authorized, in his discretion,\r\nto direct that the representatives of the United States to\r\nsuch government shall bear the same designation.  This provision\r\nshall in no wise affect the duties, powers, or salary of such\r\nrepresentative.\"\r\n\r\nThis had the hearty approval of Senators Allison and Hale,\r\nthe leading members of the Committee on Appropriations, and\r\nwas reported favorably by that Committee.\r\n\r\nSenator Vest was absent when the matter came up, and it passed\r\nwithout opposition.  Mr. Vest announced, the next day, that\r\nhe had intended to oppose it.  I am afraid if he had, he would\r\nhave succeeded in defeating it.\r\n\r\nWhen it went to the House, the Committee on Appropriations\r\nconsented to retain the amendment, and it was favored by Mr.\r\nHitt of Illinois, who had, himself, represented the country\r\nabroad and knew all about such matters.  There was a little\r\nopposition in the House.  But it was quieted without great\r\ndifficulty.  Vice-President Morton, who had, himself, represented\r\nthe country at Paris, went personally to the House and used\r\nhis great influence in favor of the proposition.  Mr. Blount\r\nof Georgia, a very influential Democrat, threatened to make\r\na strong opposition.  But the gentlemen who favored it said\r\nto him:  \"Now you are going out of the House, but your countrymen\r\nwill not long let you stay in retirement.  You will be summoned\r\nto important public service somewhere.  It is quite likely\r\nthat your political friends will call you to one of these\r\nimportant diplomatic places, where you will be in danger of\r\nsuffering the inconvenience yourself, if the present system\r\ncontinue.\" Mr. Blount was pacified.  And the measure which\r\nI think would have been beaten by a pugnacious opposition\r\nin either House of Congress, got through.\r\n\r\nAmong the most impressive recollections of my life is the\r\nfuneral of Tennyson in Westminster Abbey.  I got a seat at\r\nthe request of the American Minister by the favor of Archdeacon\r\nFarrar, who had charge of the arrangements.  It was a most\r\nimpressive scene.  I had a seat near the grave, which was\r\nin the Poets' Corner, of which the pavement had been opened.\r\nThe wonderful music; the stately procession which followed\r\nthe coffin through the historic West entrance, in the most\r\nvenerable building in the world, to lay the poet to sleep\r\nhis last sleep with England's illustrious dead of more than\r\na thousand years,\r\n\r\n  In those precincts where the mighty rest,\r\n  With rows of statesmen and with walks of Kings,\r\n\r\nto which\r\n\r\n  Ne'er since their foundation came a nobler guest,\r\n\r\nwas unspeakably touching and impressive.  The solemn burial\r\nservice was conducted by the aged Dean, doomed, not long after,\r\nto follow the beloved poet to his own final resting-place\r\nnear by.\r\n\r\nThe choir sang two anthems, both by Tennyson--\"Crossing the\r\nBar\" and \"Silent Voices\"--the music of the latter by Lady\r\nTennyson.\r\n\r\nThe grave lay next to Robert Browning's, hard by the monument\r\nto Chaucer.  I looked into it and saw the oaken coffin with\r\nthe coronet on the lid.\r\n\r\nThe pall-bearers were the Duke of Argyle, Lord Dufferin,\r\nLord Selbourne, Lord Rosebery, Mr. Jowett, Mr. Lecky, Mr.\r\nFroude, Lord Salisbury, Dr. Butler, Head of Trinity, Cambridge,\r\nSir James Paget, Lord Kelvin and the United States Minister.\r\nThe place of Mr. Lincoln, who had gone home on leave of absence,\r\nwas taken by Mr. Henry White.\r\n\r\nAfter depositing the body, the bearers passed the seat where\r\nI sat, one by one, pressing through between two rows of seats,\r\nso that their garments touched mine as they went by.\r\n\r\nThe day was cloudy and mournful, blending an unusual gloom\r\nwith the dim religious light of the Abbey.  But just as the\r\nbody was let down into the earth, the sun came out for a moment\r\nfrom the clouds, cheering and lightening up the nave and aisles\r\nand transepts of the mighty building.  As the light struck\r\nthe faces of the statues and the busts, it seemed for a moment\r\nthat the countenances changed and stirred with a momentary\r\nlife, as if to give a welcome to the guest who had come to\r\nbreak upon their long repose.  Of course it was but an idle\r\nimagination, begot, perhaps, of the profound excitement which\r\nsuch a scene, to the like of which I was so utterly unaccustomed,\r\nmade upon me.  But as I think of it now, I can hardly resist\r\nthe belief that it was real.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune during this journey to become the\r\npurchaser of Wordsworth's Bible.  It was presented to him\r\nby Frederick William Taber, the famous writer of hymns.  While\r\nit is absolutely clean, it bears the mark of much use.  It\r\nwas undoubtedly the Bible of Wordsworth's old age.  On my\r\nnext visit to England I told John Morley about it.  He said,\r\nif it had been known, I never should have been allowed to\r\ntake it out of England.  It bears the following inscription\r\nin Taber's handwriting:\r\n\r\n  William Wordsworth\r\n  From Frederick Wm Taber,\r\n  In affectionate acknowledgment of his many kindnesses,\r\n  and of the pleasure and advantage of his friendship.\r\n  Ambleside.  New Year's Eve.  1842.  A. D.\r\n  Be stedfast in thy Covenant, and be _conversant_\r\n  therein, and wax old in thy work.\r\n  Ecclesiasticus XI. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nVISITS TO ENGLAND\r\n1896\r\n\r\nIn 1896 I found myself again utterly broken down in health\r\nand strength.  I had, the November before, a slight paralysis\r\nin the face, which affected the muscles of the lower lid of\r\none of my eyes, causing a constant irritation in the organ\r\nitself.  After a time this caused a distortion of the lips,\r\nwhich I concealed somewhat by a moustache.  But it operated,\r\nfor a little while, as an effective disguise.  When I came\r\nhome during the winter, an old conductor on the Boston & Albany\r\nRailroad, whom I had known quite well, when he took my ticket\r\nlooked at me with some earnestness and said, \"Are you not\r\nrelated to Senator Hoar?\"  To which I answered, \"I am a connection\r\nof his wife, by marriage.\"\r\n\r\nI found I must get rid of the work at home, if I were to\r\nget back my capacity for work at all.  So I sailed for Southampton\r\nbefore the session of Congress ended.  It was the only time\r\nI had absented myself from my duties in Congress, except for\r\nan urgent public reason, for twenty-seven years and more.\r\n\r\nI saw a good many interesting English people.  It is not\r\nworth while to give the details of dinners and lunches and\r\nsocial life, unless something of peculiar and general interest\r\noccur.  Almost every American who can afford it goes abroad\r\nnow.  Our English kinsmen are full of hospitality.  They have\r\ngot over their old coldness with which they were apt to receive\r\ntheir American cousins, although they were always the most\r\ndelightfully hospitable race on earth when you had once got\r\nwithin the shield of their reserve.\r\n\r\nI remember especially, however, a very pleasant Sunday spent\r\non the Thames, at the delightful home of William Grenfell,\r\nEsq., which I mention because, by a fortunate accident, the\r\nvisit had some very interesting consequences.  There I met\r\nSir John Lubbock, now Baron Avebury, famous for his writings\r\non financial questions and on Natural History, especially\r\nfor his observations of the habits of ants.  He told me, if\r\nI am not mistaken, that he had personally watched the conduct\r\nand behavior of more than fifteen thousand individual ants.\r\nThere was a company of agreeable English ladies and gentlemen.\r\nThey played games in the evening after dinner, as you might\r\nexpect of a company of American boys and girls of sixteen\r\nor eighteen years old.\r\n\r\nMr. Grenfell was a famous sportsman.  His house was filled\r\nwith the trophies of his skill in hunting.  I was told that\r\nhe had crossed the Channel in a row-boat.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock invited me to breakfast with him a few days\r\nafterward in St. James Square.  There I met a large number\r\nof scientific men, among them the President of the Geographical\r\nSociety, and the Presidents or Heads of several other of the\r\nimportant British Societies.  I was presented to all these\r\ngentlemen.  But I found I could not easily understand the\r\nnames, when they were presented.  Englishmen usually, even\r\nwhen they speak the language exactly as we do, have a peculiar\r\npronunciation of names, which makes it very hard for an American\r\near to catch them.  I could not very well say, \"What name\r\ndid you say?\" or ask the host to repeat himself.  So I was\r\nobliged to spend the hour in ignorance of the special dignity\r\nof most of the illustrious persons whom I met.\r\n\r\nJust behind my chair hung a full-length portrait of Admiral\r\nBoscawen, a famous naval officer connected with our early\r\nhistory.  For him was named the town of Boscawen in New Hampshire,\r\nwhere Daniel Webster practised law.  The house where we were\r\nhad been his.  I think he was in some way akin to the host.\r\n\r\nI sailed for home on Wednesday.  The Friday night before,\r\nI dined with Moreton Frewen, Esq., an accomplished English\r\ngentleman, well known on this side of the Atlantic.  Mr. Frewen\r\nhad been very kind and hospitable to me, as he had been to\r\nmany Americans.  He deserves the gratitude of both nations\r\nfor what he has done to promote good feeling between the two\r\ncountries by his courtesy to Americans of all parties and\r\nways of thinking.  He has helped make the leading men of both\r\ncountries know each other.  From that knowledge has commonly\r\nfollowed a hearty liking for each other.\r\n\r\nI mention this dinner, as I did the visit to Mr. Grenfell,\r\nbecause of its connection with a very interesting transaction.\r\nThe guests at the dinner were Sir Julian Pauncefote, afterward\r\nLord Pauncefote, the British Ambassador to the United States,\r\nwho was then at home on a brief visit; Sir Seymour Blaine,\r\nan old military officer who had won, as I was told, great\r\ndistinction in the East, and two Spanish noblemen.\r\n\r\nThe soldier told several very interesting stories of his\r\nmilitary life, and of what happened to him in his early days.\r\n\r\nOf these I remember two.  He said that when he was a young\r\nofficer, scarcely more than a boy, he was invited by the Duke\r\nof Wellington, with other officers, to a great ball at Apsley\r\nHouse.  Late in the evening, after the guests had left the\r\nsupper room, and it was pretty well deserted, he felt a desire\r\nfor another glass of wine.  There was nobody in the supper\r\nroom.  He was just pouring out a glass of champagne for himself,\r\nwhen he heard a voice behind him.  \"Youngster, what are you\r\ndoing?\"  He turned round.  It was the Duke.  He said, \"I am\r\ngetting a glass of wine.\" To this the Duke replied, \"You ought\r\nto be up-stairs dancing.  There are but two things, Sir, for\r\na boy like you to be doing.  One is fighting; the other dancing\r\nwith the girls.  As for me I'm going to bed.\" Thereupon the\r\nDuke passed round the table; touched a spring which opened\r\na secret door, in what was apparently a set of book-shelves,\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nSir Seymour Blaine told another story which, I dare say,\r\nis well known.  But I have never seen it in print.  He said\r\nthat just before the Battle of Talavera when the Duke, then\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley, was in command in Spain, the English\r\nand French armies had been marching for many days on parallel\r\nlines, neither quite liking to attack the other, and neither\r\nhaving got the advantage in position which they were seeking.\r\nAt last, one day, when everybody was pretty weary with the\r\nfatigues of the march, the Duke summoned some of his leading\r\nofficers together and said to them:  \"You see that clump of\r\ntrees (pointing to one a good distance away, but in sight\r\nfrom where they stood)--when the head of the French column\r\nreaches that clump of trees, attack.  As for me I'm going\r\nto sleep under this bush.\"  Thereupon the great soldier lay\r\ndown, all his arrangements being made, and everything being\r\nin readiness, and took his nap while the great battle of Talavera--\r\non which the fate of Spain and perhaps the fate of Europe\r\ndepended--was begun.  This adds another instance to the list\r\nof the occasions to which Mr. Everett refers when he speaks\r\nof Webster's sleeping soundly the night before his great reply\r\nto Hayne.\r\n\r\n\"So the great Conde' slept on the eve of the battle of Rocroi;\r\nso Alexander slept on the eve of the battle of Arbela; and\r\nso they awoke to deeds of immortal fame!\"\r\n\r\nBut this dinner of Mr. Frewen's had a very interesting consequence.\r\nAs I took leave of him at his door about eleven o'clock, he\r\nasked me if there were anything more he could do for me.  I\r\nsaid, \"No, unless you happen to know the Lord Bishop of London.\r\nI have a great longing to see the Bradford Manuscript before\r\nI go home.  It is in the Bishop's Library.  I went to Fulham\r\nthe other day, but found the Bishop was gone.  I had supposed\r\nthe Library was a half-public one.  I asked the servant who\r\ncame to the door for the librarian.  He told me there was\r\nno such officer, and that it was treated in all respects as\r\na private library.  But I should be very glad if I could get\r\nan opportunity to see it.\" Mr. Frewen answered, \"I do not\r\nmyself know the Bishop.  But Mr. Grenfell, at whose house\r\nyou spent Sunday, a little while ago, is his nephew by marriage.\r\nHe is in Scotland.  But if I can reach him, I will procure for\r\nyou a letter to his uncle.\"  That was Friday.  Sunday morning\r\nthere came a note from Mr. Grenfell to the Bishop.  I enclosed\r\nit to his Lordship in one from myself, in which I said that\r\nif it were agreeable to him, I would call at Fulham the next\r\nTuesday, at an hour which I fixed.  I got a courteous reply\r\nfrom the Bishop, in which he said that he would be glad to\r\nshow me the \"log of the Mayflower,\" as he called it.  I kept\r\nthe appointment, and found the Bishop with the book in his\r\nhand.  He received me very courteously, and showed me a little\r\nof the palace.  He said that there had been a Bishop's palace\r\non that spot for more than a thousand years.\r\n\r\nI took the precious manuscript in my hands, and examined\r\nit with an almost religious reverence.  I had delivered the\r\naddress at Plymouth, the twenty-first of December, 1895, on\r\nthe occasion of the two hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary\r\nof the landing of the Pilgrims upon the rock.  In preparing\r\nfor that duty I read carefully, with renewed enthusiasm and\r\ndelight, the noble and touching story as told by Governor\r\nBradford.  I declared then that this precious history ought\r\nto be in no other custody than that of their children.\r\n\r\nThere have been several attempts to procure the return of\r\nthe manuscript to this country.  Mr. Winthrop, in 1860, through\r\nthe venerable John Sinclair, Archdeacon, urged the Bishop\r\nof London to give it up, and proposed that the Prince of Wales,\r\nthen just coming to this country, should take it across the\r\nAtlantic and present it to the people of Massachusetts.  The\r\nAttorney-General, Sir Fitzroy Kelley, approved the plan, and\r\nsaid it would be an exceptional act of grace, a most interesting\r\naction, and that he heartily wished the success of the application.\r\nBut the Bishop refused.  Again, in 1869, John Lothrop Motley,\r\nthe Minister to England, who had a great and deserved influence\r\nthere, repeated the proposition, at the suggestion of that\r\nmost accomplished scholar, Justin Winsor.  But his appeal\r\nhad the same fate.  The Bishop gave no encouragement, and said,\r\nas had been said nine years before, that the property could\r\nnot be alienated without an Act of Parliament.  Mr. Winsor\r\nplanned to repeat the attempt on his visit to England in 1887.\r\nWhen he was at Fulham the Bishop was absent, and he was obliged\r\nto go home without seeing him in person.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, at the time of the death of President Garfield,\r\nBenjamin Scott, Chamberlain of London, proposed again in\r\nthe newspapers that the restitution should be made.  But\r\nnothing came of it.\r\n\r\nWhen I went abroad I determined to visit the locality on\r\nthe borders of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, from which Bradford\r\nand Brewster and Robinson, the three leaders of the Pilgrims,\r\ncame, and where their first church was formed, and the places\r\nin Amsterdam and Leyden where the emigrants spent thirteen\r\nyears.  But I longed especially to see the manuscript of Bradford\r\nat Fulham, which then seemed to me, as it now seems to me,\r\nthe most precious manuscript on earth, unless we could recover\r\none of the four gospels as it came in the beginning from the\r\npen of the Evangelist.\r\n\r\nThe desire to get it back grew and grew during the voyage\r\nacross the Atlantic.  I did not know how such a proposition\r\nwould be received in England.  A few days after I landed\r\nI made a call on John Morley.  I asked him whether he thought\r\nthe thing could be done.  He inquired carefully into the story,\r\ntook down from his shelf the excellent though brief life of\r\nBradford in Leslie Stephen's \"Biographical Dictionary,\" and\r\ntold me he thought the book ought to come back to us, and\r\nthat he should be glad to do anything in his power to help.\r\nIt was my fortune, a week or two after, to sit next to Mr.\r\nBayard at a dinner given to Mr. Collins, by the American consuls\r\nin Great Britain.  I took occasion to tell him the story,\r\nand he gave me the assurance, which he afterward so abundantly\r\nand successfully fulfilled, of his powerful aid.  I was compelled,\r\nby the health of one of the party with whom I was travelling,\r\nto go to the Continent almost immediately, and was disappointed\r\nin the hope of an early return to England.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the volume and reading the records on the\r\nflyleaf, I said:  \"My Lord, I am going to say something which\r\nyou may think rather audacious.  I think this book ought to\r\ngo back to Massachusetts.  Nobody knows how it got over here.\r\nSome people think it was carried off by Governor Hutchinson,\r\nthe Tory Governor; other people think it was carried off by\r\nBritish soldiers when Boston was evacuated; but in either\r\ncase the property would not have changed.  Or, if you treat\r\nit as booty, in which last case, I suppose, by the law of\r\nnations ordinary property does change, no civilized nation\r\nin modern times applies that principle to the property of\r\nlibraries and institutions of learning.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop said:  \"I did not know you cared anything about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said I, \"if there were in existence in England a history\r\nof King Alfred's reign for thirty years, written by his own\r\nhand, it would not be more precious in the eyes of Englishmen\r\nthan this manuscript is to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I think myself that it ought to go back,\r\nand if it depended on me it would have gone back before this.\r\nBut many of the Americans who have been here have been commercial\r\npeople, and did not seem to care much about it except as a\r\ncuriosity.  I suppose I ought not to give it up on my own\r\nauthority.  It belongs to me in my official capacity, and\r\nnot as private or personal property.  I think I ought to consult\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury.  And, indeed,\" he added, \"I\r\nthink I ought to speak to the Queen about it.  We should not\r\ndo such a thing behind Her Majesty's back.\"\r\n\r\nI said:  \"Very well, when I go home I will have a proper\r\napplication made from some of our literary societies, and\r\nask you to give it consideration.\"\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. Bayard again and told him the story.  He was at\r\nthe train when I left London for the steamer at Southampton.\r\nHe entered with great interest into the matter, and told me\r\nagain he would do anything in his power to forward it.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home I communicated with Secretary Olney about\r\nit, who took a kindly interest in the matter, and wrote to\r\nMr. Bayard that the Administration desired he should do everything\r\nin his power to promote the application.  The matter was then\r\nbrought to the attention of the Council of the American Antiquarian\r\nSociety, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Pilgrim\r\nSociety of Plymouth and the New England Society of New York.\r\nThese bodies appointed committees to unite in the application.\r\nGovernor Wolcott was also consulted, who gave his hearty approbation\r\nto the movement, and a letter was despatched through Mr. Bayard.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Bishop Temple, with whom I had my conversation,\r\nhad himself become Archbishop of Canterbury, and in that capacity\r\nPrimate of all England.  His successor, Rev. Dr. Creighton,\r\nhad been the delegate of Emanuel, John Harvard's College,\r\nto the great celebration at Harvard University in 1886, on\r\nthe two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its foundation.\r\nHe had received the degree of Doctor of Laws from the University,\r\nhad been a guest of President Eliot, and had received President\r\nEliot as his guest in England.\r\n\r\nThe full story of the recovery of the manuscript, in which\r\nthe influence of Ambassador Bayard and the kindness of Bishop\r\nTemple, afterward Archbishop of Canterbury, had so large a\r\npart, is too long to tell here.  Before the question was decided\r\nArchbishop Temple consulted Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, who\r\ntook a deep interest in the matter, and gave the plan her\r\ncordial approval.  I think, as I had occasion to say to the\r\nBritish Ambassador afterward, that the restoration of this\r\npriceless manuscript did more to cement the bonds of friendship\r\nbetween the people of the two countries than forty Canal Treaties.\r\nIn settling Imperial questions both nations are thinking,\r\nproperly and naturally, of great interests.  But his restoration\r\nwas an act of purest kindness.  The American people, in the\r\nmidst of all their material activities, their desire for wealth\r\nand empire, are a sentimental people, easily and deeply stirred\r\nby anything that touches their finer feelings, especially\r\nanything that relates to their history.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was authorized to return the manuscript by a decree\r\nrendered in his own Court, by his Chancellor.  The Chancellor\r\nis regarded as the servant of the Bishop, and holds office,\r\nI believe, at his will.  But so does the King's Chancellor\r\nat the King's will.  I suppose the arrangement by which the\r\nChancellor determines suits in which his superior is affected\r\nmay be explained on the same ground as the authority of the\r\nLord Chancellor to determine suits in which the Crown is a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nI was quite curious to know on what ground, legal or equitable,\r\nthe decree for the restoration of the manuscript was made.\r\nI wrote, after the thing was over, to the gentleman who had\r\nacted as Mr. Bayard's counsel in the case, asking him to enlighten\r\nme on this subject.  I got a very courteous letter from him\r\nin reply, in which he said he was then absent from home, but\r\nwould answer my inquiry on his return.  After he got back,\r\nhowever, I got a formal and ceremonious letter, in which he\r\nsaid that, having been employed by Mr. Bayard as a public\r\nofficer, he did not think he was at liberty to answer questions\r\nasked by private persons.  As the petition and decree had\r\ngone on the express ground that the application for the return\r\nof the manuscript was made by Mr. Bayard, not in his official,\r\nbut only in his private capacity, as he had employed counsel\r\nat my request, and I had been responsible for their fees,\r\nI was, at first, inclined to be a little vexed at the answer.\r\nOn a little reflection, however, I saw that it was not best\r\nto be too curious on the subject; that where there was a will\r\nthere was a way, and probably there was no thought, in getting\r\nthe decree, on the part of anybody concerned, to be too strict\r\nas to legalities.  I was reminded, however, of Silas Wegg's\r\nanswer to Mr. Boffin, when he read aloud to him and his wife\r\nevening after evening \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\"\r\nwhich Silas had spoken of at first, as \"The Decline and Fall\r\nof the Russian Empire.\"  Mr. Boffin noticed the inconsistency,\r\nand asked Mr. Wegg why it was that he had called it \"The Decline\r\nand Fall of the Russian Empire\" in the beginning.  To which\r\nMr. Wegg replied that Mrs. Boffin was present, and that it\r\nwould not be proper to answer that question in the presence\r\nof a lady.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript was brought to Massachusetts by Mr. Bayard,\r\non his return to the United States at the end of his official\r\nterm.  It was received by the Legislature in the presence\r\nof a large concourse of citizens, to whom I told the story\r\nof the recovery.  Mr. Bayard delivered the book to the Governor\r\nand the Legislature with an admirable speech, and Governor\r\nWolcott expressed the thanks of the State in an eloquent reply.\r\nHe said that \"the story of the departure of this precious\r\nwork from our shores may never in every detail be revealed;\r\nbut the story of its return will be read of all men, and will\r\nbecome a part of the history of the Commonwealth.  There are\r\nplaces and objects so intimately associated with the world's\r\ngreatest men or with mighty deeds that the soul of him who\r\ngazes upon them is lost in a sense of reverent awe, as it\r\nlistens to the voice that speaks from the past, in words like\r\nthose which came from the burning bush, 'Put off thy shoes\r\nfrom off they feet, for the place whereon thou standest is\r\nholy ground.'\r\n\r\n\"The story here told is one of triumphant achievement, and\r\nnot of defeat.  As the official representative of the Commonwealth,\r\nI receive it, sir, at your hands.  I pledge the faith of the\r\nCommonwealth that for all time it shall be guarded in accordance\r\nwith the terms of the decree under which it is delivered into\r\nher possession as one of her chiefest treasures.  I express\r\nthe thanks of the Commonwealth for the priceless gift, and\r\nI venture the prophecy that for countless years to come and\r\nto untold thousands these mute pages shall eloquently speak\r\nof high resolve, great suffering and heroic endurance made\r\npossible by an absolute faith in the over-ruling providence\r\nof Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop gave the Governor of Massachusetts the right to\r\ndeposit the manuscript either in his office at the State\r\nHouse or with the Massachusetts Historical Society, of which\r\nArchbishop Temple and Bishop Creighton, who succeeded Bishop\r\nTemple in the See of London, were both Honorary members.  The\r\nGovernor, under my advice, deposited the manuscript in the\r\nState House.  It seemed to him and to me that the Commonwealth,\r\nwhich is made up of the Colony which Bradford founded, and\r\nof which he was Governor, blended with that founded by the\r\nPuritans under Winthrop, was the fitting custodian of the\r\nlife in Leyden of the founders of Plymouth, of the voyage\r\nacross the sea, and of the first thirty years of the Colony\r\nhere.  It is kept in the State Library, open at the spot which\r\ncontains the Compact made on board the Mayflower--the first\r\nwritten Constitution in history.  Many visitors gaze upon\r\nit every year.  Few of them look upon it without a trembling\r\nof the lip and a gathering of mist in the eye.  I am told\r\nthat it is not uncommon that strong men weep when they behold\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\nSILVER AND BIMETALLISM\r\n\r\nI was compelled, by the state of my health, to be absent\r\nfrom the country in the campaign which preceded the Presidential\r\nelection of 1896, except for the last week or two.  But, of\r\ncourse, I took a very deep interest indeed in the campaign.\r\nMr. Bryan's theories, and those of his followers in many parts\r\nof the country, had thoroughly alarmed the business men of\r\nthe Northern and Eastern States.  But in the new States of\r\nthe Northwest, especially in those that contained silver mines,\r\na large majority of the people, without distinction of party,\r\nhad become converts to the doctrine that the United States\r\nshould coin silver at a ratio compared to gold of sixteen\r\nto one, and make the silver so coined legal tender in the\r\npayment of all debts, public and private.  The price of silver\r\nas compared with that of gold had been constantly falling\r\nfor several years past.  This was attributed to the effect\r\nof the legislation which demonetized silver except to a limited\r\namount.  Several eminent Republicans, both in the Senate and\r\nin the House, as well as many others in private station, left\r\nthe Republican Party on that issue.  Several States that had\r\nbeen constantly and reliably Republican became Democratic\r\nor Populist, under the same influence.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Platform of 1896 demanded the immediate restoration\r\nof the free coinage of gold and silver at the present ratio\r\nof 16 to 1, without waiting for the consent of any other nation.\r\nThat doctrine was reaffirmed and endorsed in the Democratic\r\nNational Platform for 1900.\r\n\r\nThere were two theories among the persons who desired to maintain\r\nthe gold standard.  One was entertained by the persons known\r\nas Gold Monometallists.  They insisted that no value could\r\nbe given to any commodity by legislation.  They said that\r\nnothing could restore silver to its old value as compared\r\nwith gold; that its fall was owing to natural causes, chiefly\r\nto the increased production.  They insisted that every attempt\r\nto restore silver to its old place would be futile, and that\r\nthe promise to make the attempt, under any circumstances,\r\nwas juggling with the people, from which nothing but disaster\r\nand shame would follow.  They justly maintained that, if we\r\nundertook the unlimited coinage of silver, and to make it\r\nlegal tender, under the inevitable law long ago announced\r\nby Gresham, the cheaper metal, silver, would flow into the\r\ncountry where it would have a larger value for the purpose\r\nof paying debts, and that gold, the more precious metal, would\r\ndesert the country where there would be no use found for it\r\nas long as the cheaper metal would perform its function according\r\nto law.  From this, it was claimed, would follow the making\r\nof silver the exclusive basis of all commercial transactions;\r\nthe disturbance of our commercial relations with other countries,\r\nand the establishment of a standard of value which would fluctuate\r\nand shrink as the value of silver fluctuated and shrunk.  So\r\nthat no man who contracted a debt on time could tell what\r\nwould be the value of the coin he would be compelled to pay\r\nwhen his debt became due, and all business on earth would\r\nbecome gambling.  They, therefore, demanded that the Republican\r\nParty should plant itself squarely on the gold standard; should\r\nannounce its purpose to make gold the exclusive legal tender\r\nfor the country, and appeal to the people for support in the\r\nPresidential election, standing on that ground.\r\n\r\nTo them their antagonists answered, that the true law was\r\nstated by Alexander Hamilton in his famous Report, accepted\r\nby all his contemporaries, and by all our statesmen of all\r\nparties down to 1873 or thereabouts, and recognised in the\r\nConstitution of the United States.  That doctrine was, that\r\nthe standard of value must necessarily be fixed by the agreement\r\nof all commercial nations.  No nation could, without infinite\r\nsuffering and mischief, undertake to set itself against the\r\nrule adopted by the rest of mankind.  It was best, if the\r\nnations would consent to it, to have two metals instead of\r\none made legal tender, at a ratio to be agreed upon by all\r\nmankind, establishing what was called Bimetallism.  If this\r\nwere done, the Gresham law could not operate, because there\r\nwould be no occasion for the cheaper metal to flow into any\r\none country by reason of its having a preference there in\r\nthe payment of debts; and nothing which would cause the more\r\nprecious metal to depart from any country by reason of its\r\nbeing at a disadvantage.  If such a rule were adopted, and\r\na proper ratio once established, it would be pretty likely\r\nto continue, unless there were a very large increase in the\r\nproduction of one metal or the other.  If the supply of gold\r\nin proportion to silver were diminished a little, the corresponding\r\ndemand for silver by all mankind would bring up its price\r\nand cure the inequality.  So, if the supply of gold were to\r\nincrease in proportion to silver, a like effect would take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the nations of the world were to agree on one\r\nmetal alone, it was best that the most precious metal should\r\nbe taken for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe above, in substance, was the doctrine of Alexander Hamilton,\r\nthe ablest practical financier and economist that ever lived,\r\ncertainly without a rival in this country.\r\n\r\nThe duties specially assigned to me in the Senate and in\r\nthe House related to other matters.  But I made as thorough\r\nand faithful a study as I could of this great question, and\r\naccepted Hamilton's conclusions.  I believed they were right\r\nin themselves, and thought the reasons by which they were\r\nsupported, although the subject is complex and difficult,\r\nlikely to find favor with the American people.  Silver has\r\nalways been a favorite metal with mankind from the beginning.\r\nWhile gold may be the standard of value, it is too precious\r\nto be a convenient medium of payment for small sums, such\r\nas enter into the daily transactions of ordinary life.  It\r\nis said that you can no more have a double standard, or two\r\nmeasures of value, than you can have a double standard, or\r\ntwo measures of distance.  But the compensating effect may\r\nbe well illustrated by what is done by the makers of clocks\r\nfor the most delicate measurements of time, such as are used\r\nfor astronomical calculations.  The accuracy of the clock\r\ndepends upon the length of the pendulum and the weight which\r\nthe pendulum supports.  If the disk at the end of the pendulum\r\nbe humg by a wire of a single metal, that metal expands and\r\nshrinks in length under changing atmospheric influences, and\r\naffects the clock's record of time.  So the makers of these\r\nclocks resort to two or three wires of different metals, differently\r\naffected by the atmosphere.  One of these compensates for\r\nand supplements the other, so that the atmospheric changes\r\nhave much less effect than upon a single metal.\r\n\r\nBeside the fact that I thoroughly believed in the soundness\r\nof bimetallism, as I now believe in it, I thought we ought\r\nnot to give our antagonists who were pressing us so hard,\r\nand appealing so zealously to every debtor and every man in\r\npecuniary difficulties, the advantage, in debate before the\r\npeople, of arraying on their side all our great authorities\r\nof the past.  We had enough on our hands to encounter Mr.\r\nBryan and the solid South and the powerful Democratic Party\r\nof New York and the other great cities, and every man in the\r\ncountry who was uneasy and discontented, without giving them\r\nthe right to claim as their allies Alexander Hamilton, and\r\nGeorge Washington, and Oliver Ellsworth, and John C. Calhoun,\r\nand Daniel Webster, and Henry Clay, and Thomas H. Benton.\r\nI was, therefore, eager that the Republican Party should state\r\nfrankly in its platform what I, myself, deemed the sound doctrine.\r\nIt should denounce and condemn the attempt to establish the\r\nfree coinage of silver by the power of the United States\r\nalone, and declare that to be practical repudiation and national\r\nruin.  But I thought we ought also to declare our willingness,\r\nif the great commercial nations of the earth would agree,\r\nto establish a bimetallic system on a ratio to be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nSome of the enemies of the Republican Party, who could not\r\nadopt the Democratic plan for the free coinage of silver,\r\nwithout contradicting all their utterances in the past, denounced\r\nthis proposal as a subterfuge, a straddle, an attempt to deceive\r\nthe people and get votes by pledges not meant to be carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nI believed then, and I believe now, that we were right in\r\ndemanding that the Republican Party should go into the campaign\r\nwith the declaration I have stated.\r\n\r\nIt is true that you cannot give value to any commodity by\r\nlaw.  It is as idle to attempt to make an ounce of silver\r\nworth as much as an ounce of gold by legislation, as it is to\r\ntry to make one pound weigh two pounds, or one yard measure\r\ntwo yards.  You cannot increase the price of a hat, or a coat,\r\nor a farm, by act of Congress.  The value of every article,\r\nwhether gold or silver, whether used as money or as merchandise,\r\nmust depend upon the inexorable law of demand and supply.\r\nBut you can, by legislation, compel the use of an article,\r\nwhich use will create a demand for it, and the demand will\r\nthen increase its price.  If Congress shall require that every\r\nsoldier in the United States Army shall wear a hat or coat\r\nof a particular material or pattern, or shall enact that every\r\nman who votes shall come to the polls dressed in broadcloth,\r\nif there be a limited supply of these commodities, the price\r\nof the hat or the coat or the broadcloth will go up.  So,\r\nwhen the nations of the world joined in depriving silver of\r\none of its chief uses--that of serving the function of a tender\r\nfor the payment of debts, the value of silver diminished because\r\none large use which it had served before was gone.  Whether\r\nthis doctrine be sound or no, it was the result of as careful\r\nstudy as I ever gave in my life, to any subject, public or\r\nprivate.  It was not only the doctrine of the Fathers, but\r\nof recent generations.  It was the doctrine on which the Republicans\r\nof Massachusetts, a community noted for its conservatism and\r\nbusiness sagacity, had planted the Commonwealth, and it was\r\nthe doctrine on which the American people planted itself and\r\nwhich triumphed in the election of 1896.\r\n\r\nI have been accused, sometimes, of want of sincerity, and,\r\nby one leading New England paper, with having an imperfect\r\nand confused understanding of the subject.  Perhaps I may\r\nbe pardoned, therefore, for quoting two testimonials to the\r\nvalue of my personal contribution to this debate.  One came\r\nfrom Senator Clay of Georgia, one of the ablest of the Democratic\r\nleaders.  After I had stated my doctrine in a brief speech\r\nin the Senate one day, he crossed the chamber and said to\r\nme that, while he did not accept it, he thought I had made\r\nthe ablest and most powerful statement of it he had ever heard\r\nor read.  The other came from Charles Emory Smith, afterward\r\na member of President McKinley's Cabinet and editor of the\r\n_Press,_ a leading paper in Philadelphia.  I have his letter\r\nin which he says that he think an edition of at least a million\r\ncopies of my speech on gold and silver should be published\r\nand circulated through the country.  He also said, in an article\r\nin the _Saturday Evening Post,_ June 14, 1902:\r\n\r\n\"In the great contest over the repeal of the Silver Purchase\r\nAct he made the most luminous exposition, both of what had\r\nbeen done, and the reasons for it; and what ought to be done,\r\nand the grounds for it, that was heard in the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that I could render a very great service\r\nto my country, during my absence, if I could be instrumental\r\nin getting a declaration from England and France that those\r\ncountries would join with the United States in an attempt\r\nto reestablish silver as a legal tender.\r\n\r\nIt was well known that Mr. Balfour, Leader of the Administration\r\nin the House of Commons, was an earnest bimetallist.  He had\r\nso declared himself in public, both in the House and elsewhere,\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\nThere had been a resolution, not long before, signed by more\r\nthan two thirds of the French Chamber of Deputies, declaring\r\nthat France was ready to take a similar action whenever England\r\nwould move.  I, accordingly, with the intervention of Mr.\r\nFrewen, the English friend I have just mentioned, arranged\r\nan interview with Mr. Balfour in Downing Street.  We had a\r\nvery pleasant conversation indeed.  I told him that if he\r\nwere willing, in case the United States, with France and Germany\r\nand some of the smaller nations, would establish a common\r\nstandard for gold and silver, to declare that the step would\r\nhave the approval of England, and that, although she would\r\nmaintain the gold standard alone for domestic purposes, she\r\nwould make a substantial and most important contribution to\r\nthe success of the joint undertaking, that it would insure\r\nthe defeat of the project for silver monometallism, from which\r\nEngland, who was so largely our creditor, would suffer, in\r\nthe beginning almost as much as we would, and perhaps much\r\nmore, and would avert the panic and confusion in the business\r\nof the world, which would be brought about by the success\r\nof the project.\r\n\r\nI did not state to Mr. Balfour exactly what I thought the\r\ncontribution of England to this result ought to be.  He, on\r\nthe other hand, did not tell me what he thought she would\r\ndo.  I did not, of course, expect that England would establish\r\nthe free coinage of silver for her own domestic purposes.\r\nBut I thought it quite likely that she would declare her cordial\r\napproval of the proposed arrangement between the other countries,\r\nand would reopen her India mints to the free coinage of the\r\nrupee, and maintain the silver standard for the Queen's three\r\nhundred million subjects in Asia.  This contribution, I thought,\r\nif Great Britain went no farther, would give great support\r\nto silver, and would ensure the success of the concerted attempt\r\nof the other commercial nations to restore silver to its old\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour expressed his assent to my proposal, and entered\r\nheartily into the scheme.  He said he would be very happy\r\nindeed to make such a declaration.  I suggested to him that\r\nI had been authorized to say, by one or two gentlemen with\r\nwhom I had talked, that, if he were willing, a deputation\r\nof the friends of Bimetallism would wait upon him, to whom\r\nhe could express his opinion and purpose.  He said he thought\r\nit would be better that he should write a letter to me, and\r\nthat if I would write to him stating what I had said orally,\r\nhe would answer it with such a statement as I desired.  I\r\ntold him I was going to Paris in a few days, and that I would\r\nwrite to him from Paris when I got there.  The matter was\r\nleft in that way.  The next day, or the next day but one,\r\na luncheon was given me at White's, the club famous for its\r\nmemories of Pitt and Canning and the old statesmen of that\r\ntime, and still the resort of many of the Conservative leaders\r\nof to-day.  There were present some fifteen or twenty gentlemen,\r\nincluding several members of the Government.  A gentleman\r\nwho had known of my interview with Mr. Balfour, and sat at\r\nthe table some distance from me, made some allusion to it\r\nwhich was heard by most of the guests.  I said that I did\r\nnot like to repeat what Mr. Balfour had said; that gentlemen\r\nin his position preferred, if their opinions were to be made\r\npublic, to do it for themselves, rather than to have anybody\r\nelse do it for them.  To this, one member of the Government--\r\nI think it was Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, but I will not undertake\r\nto be sure--said: \"It is no secret that Mr. Balfour's opinions\r\nare those of a majority of Her Majesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\nI went to Paris, and wrote at once the letter that had been\r\nagreed upon, of which I have in my possession a copy.  I\r\nat once secured an introduction to M. Fougirot, the Member\r\nof the French Assembly who had drawn and procured the signatures\r\nto the resolution to which I just referred.  That is, I am\r\ntold, a not uncommon way in France of declaring the sense\r\nof the House in anticipation of a more formal vote.  He entered\r\nheartily into the plan.  He thought Germany would at once\r\nagree, at any rate, he was sure that Belgium, Spain, Italy\r\nand all the European commercial powers would come into the\r\narrangement, and that the whole thing would be absolutely\r\nsure if Great Britain were to agree.  I waited a week or two\r\nfor the letter from Mr. Balfour.  In the meantime I got a\r\nletter from Mr. Frewen, who told me that Mr. Balfour had\r\nshown him the letter he had written to me; that it was admirable,\r\nand eminently satisfactory.  But no letter came.  I waited\r\nanother week or two, and then got another letter from Mr.\r\nFrewen, in which he said that he had taken no copy of Mr.\r\nBalfour's letter, and had returned the original, and asked\r\nme, if I had no objection, if I would give him a copy of it.\r\nI answered that I had heard nothing, whereupon Mr. Frewen\r\nwrote a note to Mr. Balfour, telling him that I had not heard.\r\nMr. Balfour said that he had, after writing the letter, submitted\r\nit to a meeting of his colleagues; that one of them had expressed\r\nhis most emphatic disapproval of the plan, and that he did\r\nnot feel warranted in taking such a step against the objection\r\nof one of his colleagues.  I gathered, from what I heard afterward,\r\nthat Mr. Balfour wished he had sent he letter without communicating\r\nits contents.  But of this I have no right to be sure.  Mr.\r\nBalfour sent Mr. Frewen the following letter, which is now\r\nin my possession.  It was, I suppose with his approval, sent\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n10 DOWNING STREET, WHITEHALL, S. W.\r\n  August 6, 1896.\r\n\r\nDEAR MORETON FREWEN.\r\n\r\nI think Senator Hoar has just reason to complain of my long\r\nsilence.  But, the truth is that I was unwilling to tell\r\nhim that my hopes of sending him a letter for publication\r\nhad come to an end, until I was really certain that this was\r\nthe case.  I am afraid however that even if I am able now\r\nto overcome the objections of my colleagues, the letter itself\r\nwould be too late to do much good.  Please let me know what\r\nyou think on this subject.\r\n\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n  ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.\r\n\r\nI never blamed him.  He was in the midst of a good deal of\r\ndifficulty with his Education Bill.  Certainly there can\r\nbe no obligation on the Leader of the English House of Commons\r\nto do anything that he is not sure is for the interests of\r\nhis own country, or his own party, for the sake of benefitting\r\na foreign country, still less for the sake of affecting its\r\npolitics.  Indeed, I suppose Mr. Balfour would have utterly\r\nand very rightfully disclaimed any idea of writing such a\r\nletter, unless he thought what was proposed would benefit\r\nEngland.  When I went back to London, an offer was made me\r\nlater to arrange another interview with Mr. Balfour, and\r\nsee if something else could not be devised.  This I declined.\r\nI thought I had gone as far as I properly could, with a due\r\nsense of my own dignity.  The exigency at home had pretty\r\nmuch passed by.\r\n\r\nA day or two after I got to Paris, after I had seen M. Fougirot,\r\nI cabled my colleague, Mr. Lodge, at St. Louis, where the\r\ndelegates to the convention to nominate a President were then\r\ngathering, stating my hope that our convention would insert\r\nin its platform a declaration of the purpose of the Republican\r\nParty to obtain, in concert with other nations, the restoration\r\nof silver as a legal tender in company with gold, and that\r\nI had reason to feel sure that such a plan could be accomplished.\r\nThis cable reached St. Louis on the morning the convention\r\nassembled.  I do not know how much influence it had, or whether\r\nit had any, in causing the insertion of that plank in the\r\nplatform.  Such a plank was inserted.  In my opinion it saved\r\nthe Presidential election, and, in my opinion, in saving the\r\nPresidential election, it saved the country from the incalculable\r\nevil of the free coinage of silver.\r\n\r\nAfter I came home, at the next winter's session, I told the\r\nstory of what I had done, to a caucus of the Republican Senators.\r\nA Committee was thereupon appointed by John Sherman, President\r\nof the Caucus, to devise proper means for keeping the pledge\r\nof the National platform and establishing international bimetallism\r\nin concurrence with other nations.  The Committee consisted\r\nof Messrs. Wolcott, Hoar, Chandler, Carter and Gear.  They\r\nreported the Act of March 3, 1897, authorizing a commission\r\nto visit Europe for that purpose, of which Senator Wolcott\r\nwas chairman.\r\n\r\nA Commission was sent abroad by President McKinley, in pursuance\r\nof the pledge of the Republican National platform, to endeavor\r\nto effect an arrangement with the leading European nations\r\nfor an international bimetallic standard.  Senator Wolcott\r\nof Colorado, who was the head of this Commission, told me\r\nhe was emboldened to undertake it by the account I had given.\r\nThe Commission met with little success.  I conjecture that\r\nthe English Administration, although a majority of the Government,\r\nand probably a majority of the Conservative Party, were Bimetallists\r\nand favored an international arrangement on principle, did\r\nnot like to disturb existing conditions at the risk of offending\r\nthe banking interests at London, especially those which had\r\ncharge of the enormous foreign investments, the value of\r\nwhich would be constantly increasing so long as their debts\r\nwere payable, principal and interest, in gold, the value of\r\nwhich, also, was steadily appreciating.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion of some quite zealous--I will not\r\nsay presumptuous, still less ignorant or shallow writers on\r\nthis subject--to charge bimetallists with catering to a mischievous,\r\npopular delusion, for political purposes, or with shallowness\r\nin thinking or investigating.  I have had my share of such\r\ncriticism.  All I have to say in reply to it is that I have\r\ndone my best to get at the truth, without, so far as I am\r\nconcerned, any desire except to get at and utter the truth.\r\nIn addition to the authority of our own early statesmen,\r\nand to that of the eminent Englishmen to whom I have referred,\r\nI wish to cite that of my pupil and dear friend, General Francis\r\nA. Walker, who is declared by abundant European, as well as\r\nAmerican authority, to be the foremost writer on money of\r\nmodern times.  He was a thorough believer in the doctrine\r\nI have stated.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out the danger, indeed the ruin, of undertaking\r\nto reestablish silver without the consent of foreign nations.\r\nBut he declared that the happiness and, perhaps, the safety\r\nof the country rested on Bimetallism.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, every monometallist ought also to be a monoculist.\r\nPolyphemus, the old Cyclops, would be his ideal.  Unfortunately\r\nour philosophers were not in the Garden of Eden at the time\r\nwhen the Creator made the mistake of endowing men with eyes\r\nin pairs.  Perhaps it would not be too much to say that there\r\nare probably few men whose eyes do not differ from each other\r\nas to every element affecting vision by more than the degree\r\nfrom which gold and silver varied from the French standard\r\nof fifteen and a half to one for whole decades.\"\r\n\r\nThe German Imperial Parliament passed a resolution, in June,\r\n1895, in favor of Bimetallism, and the Prussian Parliament\r\npassed a resolution favoring an international bimetallic convention,\r\nprovided England joined it, May 22, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe great increase in the gold product of the world, and\r\nthe constant diminution in the value of silver, have put an\r\nend to the danger of the movement for the free coinage of\r\nsilver, and made the question purely academic or theoretic,\r\nat any rate for a good while to come.  The same causes have\r\ndiminished the desire for a bimetallic standard, and make\r\nthe difficulty of establishing a parity between silver and\r\ngold, for the present, almost insuperable.  So the question\r\nwhich excited so much public feeling throughout the world\r\nfor nearly a quarter of a century, and endangered not only\r\nthe ascendancy of the Republican Party, but the financial\r\nstrength of the United States, has become almost wholly one\r\nof theory and ancient history.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Paris I spent a few delightful weeks at Innsbruck\r\nin Austria, and Reichenhall in Germany, both near the frontier\r\nbetween those two countries.  The wonderful scenery and the\r\ncurious architecture and antiquity of those towns transport\r\none back to the Middle Ages.  But I suppose they are too well\r\nknown now, to our many travellers, to make it worth while\r\nto describe them.  I went to those places for the health of\r\na lady nearly allied to my household.  She was under the care\r\nof Baron Liebig, one of the most famous physicians in Germany,\r\nthe son of the great chemist.  I got quite well acquainted\r\nwith him.  He was a very interesting man.  He had a peculiar\r\nmethod of dealing with the diseases of the throat and lungs\r\nlike those under which my sister-in-law suffered.  He had\r\nseveral large oval apartments, air-tight, with an inner wall\r\nmade of porcelain, like that used for an ordinary vase or\r\npitcher.  From these he excluded all the air of the atmosphere,\r\nand supplied its place with an artificial air made for the\r\npurpose.  The patients were put in there, remaining an hour\r\nand three quarters or two hours each day--I do not know but\r\nsome of them for a longer time.  Then they were directed to\r\ntake long walks, increasing them in length day by day, a considerable\r\npart of the walk being up a steep hill or mountain.  I believe\r\nhis method was of very great value to the patient who was\r\nin my company.  The Baron thought he could effect a complete\r\ncure if she could stay with him several months.  But that\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nVISITS TO ENGLAND\r\n1899\r\n\r\nI visited England again in 1899.  I did not go to the Continent\r\nor Scotland.  My wife consulted a very eminent London physician\r\nfor an infirmity of the heart.  He told her to go to the Isle\r\nof Wight; remain there a few weeks; then to go to Boscombe;\r\nstay a few weeks there; then to Malvern Hills, and thence\r\nto a high place in Yorkshire, which, I believe, is nearly,\r\nif not quite, the highest inhabited spot in England.  This\r\ntreatment was eminently advantageous.  But to comply with the\r\ndoctor's direction took all the time we had at our command\r\nbefore going home.\r\n\r\nWe had a charming and delightful time in the Isle of Wight.\r\nWe stayed at a queer little Inn, known as the \"Crab and Lobster,\"\r\nkept by Miss Cass, with the aid of her sister and niece.  We\r\nmade excursions about the island.  I saw two graves side by\r\nside which had a good deal of romance about them.  One was\r\nthe grave of a woman.  The stone said that she had died at\r\nthe age of one hundred and seven.  By its side was the grave\r\nof her husband, to whom she had been married at the age of\r\neighteen, and who had died just after the marriage.  So she\r\nhad been a widow eighty-nine years, and then the couple, separated\r\nin their early youth, had come together again in the grave.\r\n\r\nWe found a singular instance of what Americans think so astonishing\r\nin England, the want of knowledge by the people of the locality\r\nwith which they were familiar in life, of persons whose names\r\nhave a world-wide reputation.  In a churchyard at Bonchurch,\r\nabout a mile from our Inn at Ventnor, is the grave of John\r\nStirling--the friend of Emerson--of whom Carlyle wrote a memoir.\r\nSterling is the author of some beautiful hymns and other poems,\r\nincluding what I think is the most splendid and spirited ballad\r\nin English literature, \"Alfred the Harper.\" Yet the sexton\r\nwho exhibited the church and the churchyard did not seem to\r\nknow anything about him, and the booksellers near by never\r\nhad heard of him.  The sexton showed, with great pride, the\r\ngrave of Isaac Williams, author of the \"Shadow of the Cross\"\r\nand some other rather tame religious poetry.  He was a devout\r\nand good man, and seemed to be a feeble imitator of Keble.\r\nI dare say, the sexton first heard of Sterling and saw his\r\ngrave when we showed it to him.\r\n\r\nThe scenery about Boscombe and the matchless views of the\r\nChannel are a perpetual delight, especially the sight, on\r\na clear day, of the Needles.\r\n\r\nWe did not find it necessary to obey the doctor's advice to\r\ngo to Yorkshire.  After leaving Boscombe, I spent the rest\r\nof my vacation at Malvern Hills, some eight or nine miles\r\nnorth of Worcester, and some twenty miles from Gloucester.\r\n\r\nThe chief delight of that summer--a delight that dwells freshly\r\nin my memory to-day, and which will never be forgotten while\r\nmy memory endures--was a journey through the Forest of Dean,\r\nin a carriage, in company with my friend--alas, that I must\r\nsay my late friend!--John Bellows, of Gloucester.  He was,\r\nI suppose, of all men alive, best qualified to be a companion\r\nand teacher of such a journey.  He has written and published\r\nfor the American Antiquarian Society an account of our journey--\r\na most delightful essay, which I insert in the appendix.\r\nHe tells the story much better than I could tell it.  My readers\r\nwill do well to read it, even if they skip some chapters of\r\nthis book for the purpose.  I am proud and happy in this way\r\nto associate my name with that of this most admirable gentleman.\r\n\r\nI visited Gloucester.  I found the houses still standing\r\nwhere my ancestors dwelt, and the old tomb in the Church\r\nof St. Mary de Crypt, with the word Hoare cut in the pavement\r\nin the chancel.\r\n\r\nMy ancestors were Puritans.  They took an active part in the\r\nresistance to Charles I., and many traces are preserved of\r\ntheir activity in the civic annals of Gloucester.  Two of\r\nmy name were Sheriffs in those days.  There were two other\r\nSheriffs whose wives were sisters of my direct ancestors.\r\nCharles Hoar, my direct ancestor, married one of the Clifford\r\nfamily, the descendant of the brother of Fair Rosamond, and\r\ntheir arms are found on a tomb, and also on a window in the\r\nold church at Frampton-on-Severn, eight miles from Gloucester,\r\nwhere the Cliffords are buried.  The spot where fair Rosamond\r\nwas born, still, I believe, belongs to the Clifford family.\r\n\r\nI got such material as I could for studying the history of\r\nthe military operations which preceded the siege and capture\r\nof Worcester and the escape of Charles II.  Several of the\r\nold houses where he was concealed are shown, as also one in\r\nWorcester from which he made his escape out of the window\r\nwhen Worcester was stormed, just as Cromwell's soldiers were\r\nentering at the door.\r\n\r\nShakespeare used to pass through Gloucester on his way to\r\nLondon.  Some of his celebrated scenes are in Gloucestershire.\r\nThe tradition is that Shakespeare's company acted in the yard\r\nof the New Inn, at Gloucester, an ancient hostelry still standing,\r\na few rods only from the Raven Tavern, which belonged to my\r\nancestors, and is mentioned in one of their wills still extant.\r\nI have no doubt my kindred of that time saw Shakespeare, and\r\nsaw him act, unless they had already learned the Puritanism\r\nwhich came to them, if not before, in a later generation.\r\n\r\nI purchased, some years ago, some twenty ancient Gloucestershire\r\ndeeds, of various dates, but all between 1100 and 1400.  One\r\nof them was witnessed by John le Hore.  It was of lands at\r\nWotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire.  I have in my possession\r\na will of Thomas Hore of Bristol, dated 1466, in which he\r\nmentions his wife Joanna, and his daughters Joanna and Margery,\r\nand his sons Thomas and John.  These names--Thomas, John,\r\nJoanna and Margery--are the names of members of the family\r\nwho dwelt in the city of Gloucester in later generations.\r\nSo I have little doubt that Thomas was of the same race, although\r\nthere is a link in the pedigree, between his death and 1560\r\nor 1570 which I cannot supply.  This Thomas bequeaths land\r\nat Wotton-under-Edge, so I conjecture that John also was of\r\nthe same race.  A large old black oak chest bound with iron,\r\nbequeathed by Thomas to Bristol in 1466, is still in the\r\npossession of the city.\r\n\r\nI was very much gratified that the people of the old City\r\nof Gloucester were glad to recognize the tie of kindred which\r\nI, myself, feel so strongly.  I received a handsome box,\r\ncontaining a beautifully bound copy of an account of the City\r\nfrom the Traders' Association of the City of Gloucester.\r\nThis account of the matter appears in the _Echo,_ a local\r\npaper of July 4, 1899.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER CITY.  GLOUCESTER TRADERS' ASSOCIATION.\r\nINTERESTING PRESENTATION\r\n\r\nOn Monday evening a largely attended public meeting was held\r\nin the Guildhall under the auspices of the Gloucester Traders'\r\nAssociation for the purpose of hearing addresses on \"The municipal\r\nelectricity supply.\"  Mr. D.  Jones (president) occupied the\r\nchair, and there were also present on the platform the Mayor\r\n(Mr. H. R. J. Braine), City High Sheriff (Mr. A. V. Hatton),\r\nCouncillors Holborook, Poole and several members of the association.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman said that in his position as president of the\r\nassociation it was his pleasurable duty to present a copy of\r\ntheir guide to Mr. G. F. Hoar, the distinguished member of\r\nthe United States Government, who had always taken a great\r\ninterest in their historic City.--The presentation consisted\r\nof a handsomely carved box made by Messrs.  Matthews and Co.\r\nfrom pieces of historic English oak supplied by Mr. H. Y.\r\nJ. Taylor.  On the outside of the cover are engraved the City\r\narms, and a brass plate explaining the presentation.  A beautifully\r\nprinted copy of the well-known guide, bound in red morocco,\r\nhas been placed within, and on the inside of the cover there\r\nis the following illuminated address:\r\n\r\n\"To the Hon. G. F. Hoar, of Worcester, Mass., Senator of the\r\nUnited States of America.  Sir,--The members of the Traders'\r\nAssociation, Gloucester, England, ask your acceptance of a\r\nbound copy of their guide to this ancient and historic City,\r\ntogether with this box made from part of a rafter taken from\r\nthe room in which Bishop Hooper was lodged the night before\r\nhis burning, and from oak formerly in old All Saints' Church,\r\nas souvenirs of the regard which the association entertains\r\nfor you and its recognition of your ardent affection for the\r\nCity of Gloucester, the honored place of the nativity of the\r\nprogenitor of your family, Charles Hoar, who was elder Sheriff\r\nin 1634; and may these sincere expressions also be typical\r\nof the sterling friendship existing between Great Britain\r\nand America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Senator Hoar had been unable to attend the meeting, and\r\nthe presentation was entrusted to the American Vice-Consul,\r\nMr. E. H. Palin, to forward to him.  Remarking on the presentation,\r\nthe Mayor expressed his regret that Mr. Hoar had been unable\r\nto accept the high and important position of American Ambassador\r\nwhich had been offered to him.  Addresses on the installation\r\nof the electric light were then given by Mr. Hammond, M.I.C.E.,\r\nand Mr. Spencer Hawes.\"\r\n\r\nI was invited by the Corporation of the City to visit them\r\nin the fall and receive the freedom of the City, which was\r\nto be bestowed at the same time on Sir Michael Hicks-Beach.\r\nBut I had arranged to return to the United States before the\r\ntime fixed for the ceremonial.  So I was deprived of that\r\ngreat pleasure and honor.\r\n\r\nI had a great longing to hear the nightingale.  I find in\r\nan old memorandum that I heard the nightingale in Warwickshire\r\nin 1860, somewhere about the twentieth of May.  But the occurrence,\r\nand the song of the bird, have wholly faded from my memory.\r\nWhen I was abroad in 1892 and '96 I hoped to hear the song.\r\nBut I was too late.  Mrs. Warre, wife of the Rector of Bemerton,\r\nGeorge Herbert's Parsonage, told me that the nightingales\r\nwere abundant in her own garden close to the Avon, but that\r\nthey did not sing after the beginning of the nesting session\r\nwhich, according to a note to White's \"History of Selborne,\"\r\nlasts from the beginning of May to the early part of June.\r\nWaller says:\r\n\r\n  Thus the wise nightingale that leaves her home,\r\n  Pursuing constantly the cheerful spring,\r\n  To foreign groves does her old music bring.\r\n\r\nThere are some counties in England where the bird is not\r\nfound.  It is abundant in Warwickshire, Gloucester and the\r\nIsle of Wight.  It is not found in Scotland, Derbyshire or\r\nYorkshire or Devon or Cornwall.  Attempts to introduce it\r\nin those places have failed.  The reason is said to be that\r\nits insect food does not exist there.\r\n\r\nI utterly failed to hear the nightingale, although I was\r\nvery close upon his track.  On the night of the fifth of\r\nJune at Freshwater, close to Tennyson's home, we were taken\r\nby a driver, between eleven and twelve at night, to two copses\r\nin one of which he said he had heard the nightingale the night\r\nbefore; and at the other they had been heard by somebody,\r\nfrom whom he got the information, within a very few days.\r\nBut the silence was unbroken, notwithstanding our patience\r\nand the standing reward I had offered to anybody who would\r\nfind one that I could hear.  Two different nights shortly\r\nafterward, I was driven out several miles past groves where\r\nthe bird was said to be heard frequently.  Nothing came of\r\nit.  May 29, at Gloucester, I rode with my friend, H. Y.\r\nJ. Taylor, Esq., an accomplished antiquary, out into the country.\r\nWe passed a hillside where he said he had heard the nightingale\r\nabout eleven o'clock in the daytime the week before.  Shakespeare\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  The nightingale, if she should sing by day,\r\n  When every goose is cackling, would be\r\n  No better a musician than the wren.\r\n\r\nBut the nightingale does sometimes sing by day.  Mr. Taylor\r\nsays that on the morning he spoke of the whole field seemed\r\nto be full of singing birds.  There were larks and finches\r\nand linnets and thrushes, and I think other birds whose name\r\nI do not remember.  But when the nightingale set up his song\r\nevery other bird stopped.  They seemed as much spellbound\r\nby the singing as he was, and Philomel had the field to himself\r\ntill the song was over.  It was as if Jenny Lind had come\r\ninto a country church when the rustic choir of boys and girls\r\nwere performing.\r\n\r\nThe nightingale will sometimes sing out of season if his\r\nmate be killed, or if the nest with the eggs therein be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHe is not a shy bird.  He comes out into the highway and will\r\nfly in and out of the hedges, sometimes following a traveller.\r\nAnd the note of one bird will, in the singing season, provoke\r\nthe others, so that a dozen or twenty will sometimes be heard\r\nrivalling one another at night, making it impossible for the\r\noccupants of the farmhouses to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe superstition is well known that if a new-married man\r\nhear the cuckoo before he hear the nightingale in the spring,\r\nhis married peace will be invaded by some stranger within\r\nthe year.  But if the nightingale be heard first he will be\r\nhappy in his love.  It is said that the young married swains\r\nin the country take great pains to hear the nightingale first.\r\nWe all remember Milton's sonnet:\r\n\r\n  O nightingale, that on yon bloomy Spray\r\n  Warbl'est at eve, when all the woods are still,\r\n  Thou with fresh hope the Lover's heart dost fill,\r\n  While the jolly hours lead on propitious May,\r\n  They liquid notes that close the eye of Day,\r\n  First heard before the shallow Cuckoo's bill\r\n  Portend success in love; O, if Jove's will\r\n  Have linkt that amorous power to thy soft lay,\r\n  Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate\r\n  Foretell my hopeless doom in some Grove nigh;\r\n  As thou from year to year hast sung too late\r\n  For my relief; yet hadst no reason why,\r\n  Whether the Muse, or Love, call thee his mate,\r\n  Both them I serve, and of their train am I.\r\n\r\nI had a funny bit of evidence that this superstition is not\r\nentirely forgotten.  A very beautiful young lady called upon\r\nus in London just as we were departing for the Isle of Wight.\r\nI told her of my great longing to hear the nightingale, and\r\nthat I hoped to get a chance.  She said that she had just\r\ncome from one of her husband's country estates; that she had\r\nnot seen a nightingale or heard one this year, although they\r\nwere very abundant there.  She said she had seen a cuckoo,\r\nwhich came about the same time.  I suppose she observed a\r\nlook of amusement on my countenance, for she added quick as\r\nlightning, \"But he didn't speak.\"\r\n\r\nI made this year a delightful visit to Cambridge University.\r\nI was the guest of Dr. Butler, the Master of Trinity, and\r\nhis accomplished wife, who had, before her marriage, beaten\r\nthe young men of Cambridge in all of the examinations.  Dr.\r\nButler spoke very kindly of William Everett, with whom he\r\nhad been contemporary at Cambridge.  He told me that Edward\r\nEverett, when he received his degree at Oxford, was treated\r\nwith great incivility by the throng of undergraduates, not\r\nbecause he was an American, but because he was a Unitarian.\r\nI told this story afterwards to Mr. Charles Francis Adams.\r\nHe confirmed it, and said that his father had refused the\r\ndegree because he did not wish to expose himself to a like\r\nincivility.\r\n\r\nI dined in the old hall of Trinity, and met many very eminent\r\nscholars.  I saw across the room Mr. Myers, the author of\r\nthe delightful essays, but did not have an opportunity to speak\r\nto him.  I was introduced, among other gentlemen, to Aldus\r\nWright, Vice or Deputy Master, eminent for his varied scholarship,\r\nand to Mr. Frazer, who had just published his admirable edition\r\nof Pausanias.\r\n\r\nA great many years ago I heard a story from Richard H. Dana,\r\nillustrating the cautious and conservative fashions of Englishmen.\r\nHe told me that when the Judges went to Cambridge for the\r\nAssizes they always lodged in the House of the Master of Trinity,\r\nwhich was a royal foundation, the claim being, that as they\r\nrepresented the King, they lodged there as of right.  On the\r\nother hand the College claims that they are there as the guests\r\nof the College, and indebted to its hospitality solely for\r\ntheir lodging.  When the Judges approach Cambridge, the Master\r\nof Trinity goes out to meet them, and expresses the hope that\r\nthey will make their home at the College during their stay;\r\nto which the Judges reply that \"They are coming.\" The Head\r\nof the College conducts them to the door.  When it is reached,\r\neach party bows and invites the other to go in.  They go in,\r\nand the Judges stay until the Assize is over.  This ceremony\r\nhas gone on for four hundred years, and it never yet has been\r\nsettled whether the Judges have a right in the Master's house,\r\nor only are there as guests and by courtesy.  I suppose that\r\nin the United States both sides would fight that question\r\nuntil it was settled somehow.  Each would say: \"I am very\r\nwilling to have the other there.  But I want to know whether\r\nhe has any right there.\"  I asked about the truth of this\r\nstory.  Dr. Butler said it was true and seemed, if I understood\r\nhim aright, to think the Judges' claim was a good one.  Mr.\r\nWright, the Deputy Master, to whom I also put the question,\r\nspoke of it with rather less respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nA REPUBLICAN PLATFORM\r\n\r\nI have had occasion several times to prepare the Republican\r\nplatform for the State Convention.  The last time I undertook\r\nthe duty was in 1894.  I was quite busy.  I shrunk from the\r\ntask and put it off until the time approached for the Convention,\r\nand it would not do to wait any longer.  So I got up one morning\r\nand resolved that I would shut myself up in my library and\r\nnot leave it until the platform was written.  Accordingly\r\nI sat down after breakfast, with the door shut, and taking\r\na pencil made a list of topics about which I thought there\r\nshould be a declaration in the platform.\r\n\r\nI wrote each at the top of a separate page on a scratch-\r\nblock, intending to fill them out in the usual somewhat grandiloquent\r\nfashion which seems to belong to that kind of literature.\r\nI supposed I had a day's work before me.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly occurred to me:  Why not take these headings\r\njust as they are, and make a platform of them, leaving the\r\nConvention and the public to amplify as they may think fit\r\nafterward.  Accordingly I tore out the leaves from the scratch-\r\nblock, and handed them to a secretary to be put into type.\r\nThe whole proceeding did not take fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThe sense of infinite relief that the Convention had when,\r\nafter listening a moment of two, they found I was getting\r\nover what they expected as a rather tedious job, with great\r\nrapidity, was delightful to behold.  I do not believe there\r\nwas ever a political platform received in this country with\r\nsuch approval, certainly by men who listened to it, as that:\r\n\r\nPLATFORM\r\n\r\n\"The principles of the Republicans of Massachusetts are as\r\nwell known as the Commonwealth itself; well known as the Republic;\r\nwell known as Liberty; well known as Justice.\r\n\r\nChief among them are:\r\n\r\nAn equal share in Government for every citizen.\r\n\r\nBest possible wages for every workman.\r\n\r\nThe American market for American labor.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar paid by the Government, both the gold and the\r\nsilver dollars of the Constitution, and their paper representatives,\r\nhonest and unchanging in value and equal to every other.\r\n\r\nBetter immigration laws.\r\n\r\nBetter naturalization laws.\r\n\r\nNo tramp, Anarchist, criminal or pauper to be let in, so\r\nthat citizenship shall not be stained or polluted.\r\n\r\nSympathy with Liberty and Republican government at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nAmericanism everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe flag never lowered or dishonored.\r\n\r\nNo surrender in Samoa.\r\n\r\nNo barbarous Queen beheading men in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nNo lynching.\r\n\r\nNo punishment without trial.\r\n\r\nFaith kept with the pensioner.\r\n\r\nNo deserving old soldier in the poorhouse.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of dram drinking and dram selling.\r\n\r\nA school at the public charge open to all the children, and\r\nfree from partisan or sectarian control.\r\n\r\nNo distinction of birth or religious creed in the rights of\r\nAmerican citizenship.\r\n\r\nDevotion paramount and supreme to the country and to the flag.\r\n\r\nClean politics.\r\n\r\nPure administration.\r\n\r\nNo lobby.\r\n\r\nReform of old abuses.\r\n\r\nLeadership along loftier paths.\r\n\r\nMinds ever open to the sunlight and the morning, ever open\r\nto new truth and new duty as the new years bring their lessons.\"\r\n\r\nI ought to explain one phrase in this platform, which I have\r\nsince much regretted.  That is the phrase, \"No barbarous Queen\r\nbeheading men in Hawaii.\"  It was currently reported in the\r\npress that the Queen of Hawaii, Liliuokalani, was a semi-\r\nbarbarous person, and that when Mr. Blount, Mr. Cleveland's\r\nCommissioner, proposed to restore her government and said\r\nthat amnesty should be extended to all persons who had taken\r\npart in the revolution, she had said with great indignation,\r\n\"What, is no one to be beheaded?\" and that upon that answer\r\nMr. Blount and Mr. Cleveland had abandoned any further purpose\r\nof using the power of the United States to bring the monarchy\r\nback again.  That, so far as I knew, had never been contradicted\r\nand had obtained general belief.\r\n\r\nI ought not to have accepted the story without investigation.\r\nI learned afterward, from undoubted authority, that the Queen\r\nis an excellent Christian woman; that she has done her best\r\nto reconcile her subjects of her own race to the new order\r\nof things; that she thinks it is better for them to be under\r\nthe power of the United States than under that of any other\r\ncountry, and that they could not have escaped being subjected\r\nto some other country if we had not taken them; and that she\r\nexpended her scanty income in educating and caring for the\r\nchildren of the persons who were about her court who had lost\r\ntheir own resources by the revolution.  I have taken occasion,\r\nmore than once, to express, in the Senate, my respect for\r\nher, and my regret for this mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nOFFICIAL SALARIES\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the House the salaries of the Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States were raised to ten thousand\r\ndollars a year, and a provision for a retiring pension, to\r\nbe continued for life to such of them as became seventy years\r\nold, and had served ten years on the Bench, was enacted.\r\n\r\nBut it is always very difficult indeed to get salaries raised,\r\nespecially the salaries of Judges.  That it was accomplished\r\nthem was due largely to the sagacity and skill of Mr. Armstrong\r\nof Pennsylvania.  He was a very sensible and excellent Representative.\r\nHis service, like that of many of the best men from Pennsylvania,\r\nwas too short for the public good.  I had very little to do\r\nwith it myself, except that I talked the matter over a good\r\ndeal with Mr. Armstrong, who was a friend of mine, and heartily\r\nsupported it.\r\n\r\nAfter I entered the Senate, however, I undertook to get through\r\na bill for raising the salaries of the Judges of the United\r\nStates District Courts.  The District Judges were expected\r\nto be learned lawyers of high reputation and character, and\r\nlarge experience.  Very important matters indeed are within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the District Courts.  They would have\r\nto deal with prize cases, if a war were to break out.  In\r\nthat case the reputation of the tribunals of the United States\r\nthroughout the world would depend largely on them.  They have\r\nalso had to do a large part of the work of the Circuit Courts,\r\nespecially since the establishment of the Circuit Courts of\r\nAppeals, as much of the time of the Circuit Judges is required\r\nin attendance there.\r\n\r\nI had great difficulty in getting the measure through.  But\r\nat last I was successful in getting the salaries, which had\r\nranged from $1,500 to $4,000 in different districts of the\r\ncountry, made uniform and raised to $5,000 a year.\r\n\r\nLater I made an attempt to have the salaries of the Judges\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States increased.  My\r\ndesire was to have the salary of the Associate Judges fixed\r\nat $15,000, being an increase of fifty per cent., that of the\r\nChief Justice to be $500 more.  I met with great difficulty,\r\nbut at last, in the winter of 1903, I succeeded in getting\r\nthrough a measure, which I had previously reported, which\r\nincreased the salary of the Associate Judges to $12,500, and\r\nthat of the Chief Justice to $13,000.  The same measure increased\r\nthe salaries of the District Judges from $5,000 to $6,000,\r\nand that of the Circuit Judges from $6,000 to $7,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe salary of Senators and Representatives is shamefully\r\nsmall.  This is a great injustice, not only to members of\r\nthe two Houses, but it is a great public injury, because the\r\ncountry cannot command the service of able men in the prime\r\nof life, unless they have already acquired large fortunes.\r\nIt cannot be expected that a lawyer making from $25,000 to\r\n$50,000 a year, or a man engaged in business, whose annual\r\nincome perhaps far exceeds that amount, will leave it for\r\n$5,000 a year.  In that way he is compelled not only to live\r\nfrugally himself, but what is more disagreeable still, to\r\nsubject his household to the live in the humblest style in\r\na costly and fashionable city, into which wealthy persons\r\nare coming from all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe members of Congress have a great many demands upon them,\r\nwhich they cannot resist.  So a Senator or Representative\r\nwith $5,000 a year, living in Washington a part of the year\r\nand at home the other part, cannot maintain his family as\r\nwell as an ordinary mechanic or salaried man who gets $2,500\r\nor $3,000 a year, and spends all his time in one place.\r\n\r\nThe English aristocracy understand this pretty well.  They\r\ngive no salary at all to the members of their House of Commons.\r\nThe result is that the poor people, the working people and\r\npeople in ordinary life, cannot get persons to represent them,\r\nfrom their own class.  That will soon be true in this country,\r\nif we do not make a change.  I suppose nearly every member\r\nof either House of Congress will tell you in private that\r\nhe thinks the salary ought to be raised.  But the poor men\r\nwill not vote for it, because they think the example will\r\nbe unpopular, and the rich men do not care about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\nPROPRIETY IN DEBATE\r\n\r\nThe race of demagogues we have always with us.  They have\r\nexisted in every government from Cleon and the Sausage-maker.\r\nThey command votes and seem to delight popular and legislative\r\nassemblies.  But they rarely get very far in public favor.\r\nThe men to whom the American people gives its respect, and\r\nwhom it is willing to trust in the great places of power,\r\nare intelligent men of property, dignity and sobriety.\r\n\r\nWe often witness and perhaps are tempted to envy the applause\r\nwhich many public speakers get by buffoonery, by rough wit,\r\nby coarse personality, by appeal to the vulgar passions.  We\r\nare apt to think that grave and serious reasonings are lost\r\non the audiences that receive them, half asleep, as if listening\r\nto a tedious sermon, and who come to life again when the stump\r\nspeaker takes the platform.  But it will be a great mistake\r\nto think that the American people do not estimate such things\r\nat their true value.  When they come to take serious action,\r\nthey prefer to get their inspiration from the church or the\r\ncollege and not from the circus.  Uncle Sam likes to be amused.\r\nBut Uncle Sam is a gentleman.  In the spring of 1869, when\r\nI first took my seat in Congress, General Butler was in the\r\nHouse.  He was perhaps as widely known to the country as any\r\nman in it except President Grant.  He used to get up some\r\nscene of quarrel or buffoonery nearly every morning session.\r\nHis name was found every day in the head-lines of the newspapers.\r\nI said to General Banks one day after the adjournment: \"Don't\r\nyou think it is quite likely that he will be the next President\r\nof the United States?\"  \"Never,\" said General Banks, in his\r\nsomewhat grandiloquent fashion.  \"Why,\" said I, \"don't you\r\nsee that the papers all over the country all full of him every\r\nmorning?  People seem to be reading about nobody else.  Wherever\r\nhe goes, the crowds throng after him.  Nobody else gets such\r\napplause, not even Grant himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hoar,\" replied General Banks, \"when I came down to the\r\nHouse this morning, there was a fight between two monkeys\r\non Pennsylvania Avenue.  There was an enormous crowd, shouting\r\nand laughing and cheering.  They would have paid very little\r\nattention to you or me.  But when they come to elect a President\r\nof the United States, they won't take either monkey.\"\r\n\r\nThe men who possess the capacity for coarse wit and rough\r\nrepartee, and who indulge it, seldom get very far in public\r\nfavor.  No President of the United States has had it.  No\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court has had it, no Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and, with scarcely an exception,\r\nno eminent Senator.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\nTHE FISH-BALL LETTER\r\n\r\nIn August, 1890, the Pittsburg _Post,_ a Democratic paper,\r\nmade a savage attack on me.  He attributed to me some very\r\nfoolish remark and declared that I lived on terrapin and champagne;\r\nthat I had been an inveterate office-seeker all my life; and\r\nthat I had never done a stroke of useful work.  Commonly it\r\nis wise to let such attacks go without notice.  To notice\r\nthem seriously generally does more harm than good to the party\r\nattacked.  But I was a good deal annoyed by the attack, and\r\nthought I would make a good-natured and sportive reply to\r\nit, instead of taking it seriously.  So I sent the editor\r\nthe following letter, which was copied quite extensively throughout\r\nthe country, North and South; and I believe put an end, for\r\nthe rest of my life, to the particular charges he had made:\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATE,\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., Aug. 10, 1890.\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE PITTSBURG POST;\r\n\r\n_My Dear Man:_  Somebody has sent me a copy of your paper\r\ncontaining an article of which you do me the honor to make\r\nme the subject.  What can have put such an extravagant yarn\r\ninto the head of so amiable and good-natured a fellow? I never\r\nsaid the thing which you attribute to me in any interview,\r\ncaucus or anywhere else.  I never inherited any wealth or\r\nhad any.  My father was a lawyer in very large practice for\r\nhis day, but he was a very generous and liberal man and never\r\nput much value upon money.  My share of his estate was about\r\n$10,500.  All the income-producing property I have in the\r\nworld, or ever had, yields a little less than $1,800 a year;\r\n$800 of that is from a life estate and the other thousand\r\ncomes from stock in a corporation which has only paid dividends\r\nfor the last two or three years, and which I am very much\r\nafraid will pay no dividend, or much smaller ones, after two\r\nor three years to come.  With that exception the house where\r\nI live, with its contents, with about four acres of land,\r\nconstitute my whole worldly possessions, except two or three\r\nvacant lots, which would not bring me $5,000 all told.  I\r\ncould not sell them now for enough to pay my debts.  I have\r\nbeen in my day an extravagant collector of books, and have\r\na library which you would like to see and which I would like\r\nto show you.  Now, as to office-holding and working.  I think\r\nthere are few men on this continent who have put so much hard\r\nwork into life as I have.  I went one winter to the Massachusetts\r\nHouse of Representatives, when I was twenty-five years old,\r\nand one winter to the Massachusetts Senate, when I was thirty\r\nyears old.  The pay was two dollars a day at that time.  I\r\nwas nominated on both occasions, much to my surprise, and\r\non both occasion declined a renomination.  I afterward twice\r\nrefused a nomination for Mayor of my city, have twice refused\r\na seat on the Supreme Bench of Massachusetts, and refused\r\nfor years to go to Congress when the opportunity was in my\r\npower.  I was at last broken down with overwork, and went\r\nto Europe for my health.  During my absence the arrangements\r\nwere made for my nomination to Congress, from which, when\r\nI got home, I could not well escape.  The result is I have\r\nbeen here twenty years as Representative and Senator, the\r\nwhole time getting a little poorer year by year.  If you\r\nthink I have not made a good one, you have my full authority\r\nfor saying anywhere that I entirely agree with you.  During\r\nall this time I have never been able to hire a house in Washington.\r\nMy wife and I have experienced the varying fortune of Washington\r\nboarding houses, sometimes very comfortable, and a good deal\r\nof the time living in a fashion to which no mechanic earning\r\ntwo dollars a day would subject his household.  Your \"terrapin\"\r\nis all in my eye, very little in my mouth.  The chief carnal\r\nluxury of my life is in breakfasting every Sunday morning\r\nwith an orthodox friend, a lady who has a rare gift for making\r\nfish-balls and coffee.  You unfortunate and benighted Pennsylvanians\r\ncan never know the exquisite flavor of the codfish, salted,\r\nmade into balls and eaten on a Sunday morning by a person\r\nwhose theology is sound, and who believes in all the five\r\npoints of Calvinism.  I am myself but an unworthy heretic,\r\nbut I am of Puritan stock, of the seventh generation, and\r\nthere is vouchsafed to me, also, some share of that ecstasy\r\nand a dim glimpse of that beatific vision.  Be assured, my\r\nbenighted Pennsylvania friend, that in that hour when the\r\nweek begins, all the terrapin of Philadelphia or Baltimore\r\nand all the soft-shelled crabs of the Atlantic shore might\r\npull at my trousers legs and thrust themselves on my notice\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\n  I am faithfully,\r\n  GEO. F. HOAR\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\nTHE BIRD PETITION\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1897 I had become very much alarmed at the\r\nprospect of the total extinction of our song-birds.  The\r\nBobolink seemed to be disappearing from the field in Massachusetts,\r\nthe beautiful Summer Red Bird had become extinct, and the\r\nOriole and the Scarlet Tanager had almost disappeared.  Many\r\nvarieties of songbirds which were familiar to my own boyhood\r\nwere unknown to my children.  The same thing seems to be going\r\non in other countries.  The famous Italian novelist, Ouida,\r\ncontributed an article in the _North American Review_ a few\r\nyears ago in which she described the extermination of the\r\nNightingale in Italy.  The Director of the Central Park, in\r\none of his Reports, stated that within fifteen or twenty years\r\nthe song-birds of the State of New York had diminished forty-\r\nfive per cent.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in the spring of 1897, Governor Claflin called\r\non me at my Committee Room in the Capitol and told me a lady\r\nhad just visited his daughter at her rooms who had on her\r\nhead eleven egrets.  These egrets are said to come from the\r\nfemale White Heron, a beautiful bird abounding in Florida.\r\nThey are a sort of bridal ornament, growing out on the head\r\nof the female at pairing time and perishing and dropping off\r\nafter the brood is reared.  So the ornament on the horrible\r\nwoman's head had cost the lives of eleven of these beautiful\r\nbirds and very likely in every case the lives of a brood of\r\nyoung ones.\r\n\r\nWhen I went home I sat down after dinner and wrote with a\r\npencil the following petition.\r\n\r\n_\"To the Great and General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:\r\n\r\n\"We, the song-birds of Massachusetts and their playfellows,\r\nmake this our humble petition:_\r\n\r\n\"We know more about you than you think we do.  We know how\r\ngood you are.  We have hopped about the roofs and looked in\r\nat the windows of the homes you have built for poor and sick\r\nand hungry people and little lame and deaf and blind children.\r\nWe have built our nests in the tress and sung many a song\r\nas we flew about the gardens and parks you have made so beautiful\r\nfor your own children, especially your poor children, to play\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"Every year we fly a great way over the country, keeping\r\nall the time where the sun is bright and warm; and we know\r\nthat whenever you do anything, other people all over the\r\ngreat land between the seas and the great lakes find it out,\r\nand pretty soon will try to do the same thing.  We know;\r\nwe know.  We are Americans just as you are.  Some of us,\r\nlike some of you, came from across the great sea, but most\r\nof the birds like us have lived here a long while; and birds\r\nlike us welcomed your fathers when they came here many years\r\nago.  Our fathers and mothers have always done their best\r\nto please your fathers and mothers.\r\n\r\n\"Now we have a sad story to tell you.  Thoughtless or bad\r\npeople are trying to destroy us.  They kill us because our\r\nfeathers are beautiful.  Even pretty and sweet girls, who\r\nwe should think would be our best friends, kill our brothers\r\nand children so that they may wear plumage on their hats.\r\nSometimes people kill us from mere wantonness.  Cruel boys\r\ndestroy our nests and steal our eggs and our young ones.  People\r\nwith guns and snares lie in wait to kill us, as if the place\r\nfor a bird were not in the sky, alive, but in a shop window\r\nor under a glass case.  If this goes on much longer, all your\r\nsong-birds will be gone.  Already, we are told, in some other\r\ncountries that used to be full of birds, they are almost gone.\r\nEven the nightingales are being all killed in Italy.\r\n\r\n\"Now we humbly pray that you will stop all this, and will\r\nsave us from this sad fate.  You have already made a law\r\nthat no one shall kill a harmless song-bird or destroy our\r\nnests or our eggs.  Will you please to make another that no\r\none shall wear our feathers, so that no one will kill us to get\r\nthem?  We want them all ourselves.  Your pretty girls are\r\npretty enough without them.  We are told that it is as easy\r\nfor you to do it as for Blackbird to whistle.\r\n\r\n\"If you will, we know how to pay you a hundred times over.\r\nWe will teach your children to keep themselves clean and neat.\r\nWe will show them how to live together in peace and love and\r\nto agree as we do in our nests.  We will build pretty houses\r\nwhich you will like to see.  We will play about your gardens\r\nand flower-beds,--ourselves like flowers on wings,--without\r\nany cost to you.  We will destroy the wicked insects and worms\r\nthat spoil your cherries and currants and plums and apples\r\nand roses.  We will give you our best songs and make the spring\r\nmore beautiful and the summer sweeter to you.  Every June\r\nmorning when you go out to the field, Oriole and Blackbird\r\nand Bobolink will fly after you and make the day more delightful\r\nto you; and when you go home tired at sundown, Vesper Sparrow\r\nwill tell you how grateful we are.  When you sit on your porch\r\nafter dark, Fife Bird and Hermit Thrush and Wood Thrush will\r\nsing to you; and even Whip-poor-will will cheer up a little.\r\nWe know where we are safe.  In a little while all the birds\r\nwill come to live in Massachusetts again, and everybody who\r\nloves music will like to make a summer home with you.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it might, perhaps, strike the Legislature of Massachusetts\r\nand the public more impressively than a sober argument.  The\r\nwhole thing took only fifteen or twenty minutes.  The petition\r\nwas signed by all the song-birds of Massachusetts, and illustrated\r\nby Miss Ellen Day Hale with the portraits of the signers.\r\nIt was presented to the Massachusetts Senate by the Honorable\r\nA. S. Roe, Senator from the Worcester District.  The Legislature\r\nacted upon it and passed the following Statute:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever has in his possession the body of feathers of any\r\nbird whose taking or killing is prohibited by section four\r\nof chapter two hundred and seventy-six of the acts of the\r\nyear eighteen hundred and eighty-six, or wears such feathers\r\nfor the purpose of dress or ornament, shall be punished as\r\nprovided in said section:  _provided_ that his act shall not\r\nbe construed to prohibit persons having the certificate provided\r\nfor in said sections from taking or killing such birds; and\r\n_provided, further,_ that this act shall not apply to Natural\r\nHistory Associations, or to the proprietors of museums, or\r\nother collections for scientific purposes.\r\n\r\n_\"Approved June 11, 1897.\"_\r\n\r\nThe Statute was copied in several other States.  I think\r\nthe petition helped a good deal the healthy reaction which,\r\nowing largely to the efforts of humane societies and Natural\r\nHistory Associations and especially of some very accomplished\r\nladies, has arrested the destruction of these beautiful ornaments\r\nof our woods and fields and gardens, \"our fellow pilgrims\r\non the journey of life,\" who have so much of humanity in them\r\nand who, like us, have their appointed tasks set to them by\r\nthe great Creator.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\nTHE A. P. A. CONTROVERSY\r\n\r\nOne very unreasonable, yet very natural excitement has stirred\r\ndeeply the American people on several occasions in our history.\r\nIt came to us by lawful inheritance from our English and Puritan\r\nancestors.  That is the bitter and almost superstitious dread\r\nof the Catholics, which has resulted more than once in riots\r\nand crimes, and more than once in the attempt to exclude them\r\nfrom political power in the country.  This has sometimes taken\r\nthe form of a crusade against all foreigners.  But religious\r\nprejudice against the Catholics has been its chief inspiration.\r\n\r\nI just said that this feeling, though absolutely unjustifiable,\r\nwas yet quite natural, and that it came to us by lawful inheritance.\r\nI have always resisted it and denounced it to the utmost of\r\nmy power.  My father was a Unitarian.  I was bred in that\r\nmost liberal of all liberal faiths.  But I have believed that\r\nthe way to encounter bigotry is by liberality.  If any man\r\ntry to deprive you of your absolute right, begin to defend\r\nyourself by giving him his own.  Human nature, certainly American\r\nhuman nature, will never, in my opinion, long hold out against\r\nthat method of dealing.\r\n\r\nOur people, so far as they are of English descent, learned\r\nfrom their fathers the stories of Catholic persecution and\r\nof the fires of Smithfield.  Fox's \"Book of Martyrs,\" one\r\nof the few books in the Puritan libraries, was, even down to\r\nthe time of my youth, reverently preserved and read in the\r\nNew England farmhouses.\r\n\r\nSo it was believed that it was only the want of power that\r\nprevented the Catholics from renewing the fires of Smithfield\r\nand the terrors of the Inquisition.  It was believed that\r\nthe infallibility and supremacy of the Pope bound the Catholic\r\ncitizen to yield unquestioning obedience to the Catholic clergy\r\nin matters civil and political, as well as spiritual.  There\r\nwas a natural and very strong dread of the Confessional.\r\n\r\nThis feeling was intensified by the fact of which it was\r\npartly the cause, that when the Irish-Catholics first came\r\nover they voted in solid body, led often by their clergy, for\r\nthe Democratic Party, which was in the minority in the New\r\nEngland States, especially in Massachusetts.  England down\r\nto a very recent time disqualified the Catholics from civil\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nOur people forgot that the religious persecution, of which\r\nthey cherished the bitter memory, was the result of the spirit\r\nof the age, and not of one form of religious faith.  They\r\nforgot that the English Protestants not only retaliated on\r\nthe Catholics when they got into power, but that the Bishops\r\nfrom whose fury, as John Milton said, our own Pilgrim Fathers\r\nfled, were Protestant Bishops and not Catholic.  They forgot\r\nthe eight hundred years during which Ireland had been under\r\nthe heel of England, and the terrible history so well told\r\nby that most English of Englishmen, and Protestant of Protestants,\r\nLord Macaulay.\r\n\r\n\"The Irish Roman Catholics were permitted to live, to be fruitful,\r\nto replenish the earth; but they were doomed to be what the\r\nHelots were in Sparta, what the Greeks were under the Ottoman,\r\nwhat the blacks now are at New York.  Every man of the subject\r\ncaste was strictly excluded from any public trust.  Take what\r\npath he might in life, he was crossed at every step by some\r\nvexatious restriction.  It was only by being obscure and inactive,\r\nthat he could, on his native soil, be safe.  If he aspired\r\nto be powerful and honoured, he might gain a cross or perhaps\r\na Marshal's staff in the armies of France or Austria.  If\r\nhis vocation was to politics, he might distinguish himself\r\nin the diplomacy of Italy or Spain.  But at home he was a\r\nmere Gibeonite, a hewer of wood and a drawer of water.  The\r\nstatute book of Ireland was filled with enactments which furnish\r\nto the Roman Catholics but too good a ground for recriminating\r\non us when we talk of the barbarities of Bonner and Gardiner;\r\nand the harshness of those odious laws was aggravated by a\r\nmore odious administration.  For, bad as the legislators were,\r\nthe magistrates were worse still.  In those evil times originated\r\nthat most unhappy hostility between landlord and tenant, which\r\nis one of the peculiar curses of Ireland.  Oppression and\r\nturbulence reciprocally generated each other.  The combination\r\nof rustic tyrants was resisted by gangs of rustic banditii.\r\nCourts of law and juries existed only for the benefit of the\r\ndominant sect.  Those priests who were revered by millions\r\nas their natural advisers and guardians, as the only authorised\r\ndispensers of the Christian sacraments, were treated by the\r\nsquires and squireens of the ruling faction as no good-natured\r\nman would treat the vilest beggar.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I came into political life shortly after 1848, I found\r\nthis anti-Catholic feeling most intense.  The Catholics in\r\nMassachusetts were, in general, in a very humble class.  The\r\nimmigration, which had well begun before the great Irish Famine,\r\nwas increased very much by that terrible calamity.  The Irishmen\r\nwere glad to build our railroads at sixty cents a day, dwelling\r\nin wretched shanties, and living on very coarse fare.  They\r\nhad brought with them the habit of drinking whiskey, comparatively\r\nharmless in their native climate--though bad enough there--\r\nbut destructive in New England.  So they contributed very\r\nlargely to the statistics of crime and disorder.\r\n\r\nEven then they gave an example--from which all mankind might\r\ntake a lesson--of many admirable qualities.  They had a most\r\npathetic and touching affection for the Old Country.  They\r\nexhibited an incomparable generosity toward the kindred they\r\nhad left behind.  From their scanty earnings, Edward Everett,\r\na high authority, estimates that there were sent twenty millions\r\nof dollars in four years to their parents and kindred.\r\n\r\nThere was some jealousy on the part of our working people,\r\nespecially the men and women employed in large manufacturing\r\nestablishments, lest the Irish, by working at cheaper wages,\r\nwould drive them out of employment.  But the Irishman soon\r\nlearned to demand all the wages he could get.  The accession\r\nof the Irish laborer increased largely the productive forces\r\nof the State.  So there was more wealth created, of which\r\nthe better educated and shrewder Yankee got the larger share.\r\nBy the bringing in of a lower class of labor he was elevated\r\nto a higher place, but never driven out of work.  The prejudice\r\nof which I have spoken showed itself in some terrible Protestant\r\nriots in New Orleans and in Baltimore, and in the burning\r\nof the Catholic Convent at Charlestown.\r\n\r\nThere was also a strong feeling that the compact body of\r\nCatholics, always voting for one political party was a danger\r\nto the public security.  Of course this feeling manifested\r\nitself in the Whig Party, for whose adversary the solid Irish-\r\nCatholic vote was cast.  As early as 1844, after the defeat\r\nof Mr. Clay, Mr. Webster made a suggestion--I do know where\r\nit is recorded now, but I was informed of it on good authority\r\nat about the time he made it--that there must be some public\r\ncombination with a view to resist the influence of our foreign\r\nelement in our politics.\r\n\r\nBut there was no political movement on any considerable scale\r\nuntil 1854.  In that year there was a very dangerous crusade\r\nwhich came very near National success, and which got control\r\nof several States.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1857 the Republican Party elected its first\r\nGovernor.  The slavery question was still very prominent,\r\nand the people were deeply stirred by the attempt to repeal\r\nthe Missouri Compromise.  So in that year, under the leadership\r\nof Nathaniel P. Banks, Gardner, the Know-Nothing Governor,\r\nwas defeated, and from that time the strength of Know-Nothingism\r\nwas at an end.  I was elected to the Senate in the fall of\r\n1856 as the Republican candidate from the county of Worcester\r\nover the Know-Nothing and Democratic candidates.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that of the men known to join the\r\nKnow-Nothing Party, no man, unless he were exceedingly young\r\nand obscure when he did it, ever maintained or regained the\r\npublic confidence afterward, with the exception of Henry Wilson,\r\nAnson Burlingame and Nathaniel P. Banks.  These men all left\r\nit after the first year.  Wilson and Burlingame denounced\r\nit with all the vigor at their command, and Banks led the\r\nforces of the Republican Party to its overthrow.\r\n\r\nI ought to say, however, of this movement and of the A. P.\r\nA. movement, as it is called, of which I am now to speak,\r\nthat I do not think the leaders in general shared the bitter\r\nand proscriptive feeling to which they appealed.  The secret\r\norganization, founded on religious prejudice, or on race prejudice,\r\nis a good instrument to advance the political fortunes of\r\nmen who could not gain advancement in an established political\r\norganization.  So a great many men are active and busy in\r\nsuch organizations, who would be equally active and busy in\r\nmovements founded on precisely the opposite doctrines, if\r\nthey could as well find their advancement in them.  Yet, as\r\nI have said, the prejudice which lay at the bottom of this\r\nmovement was very powerful, very sincere, and not unnatural.\r\n\r\nSecret societies were formed all over the country.  It seemed\r\nnot unlikely that the surprise of 1854 would be repeated,\r\nand that the great Republican party, which had done so much\r\nfor civil liberty, would either be broken to pieces or would\r\nbe brought to take an attitude totally inconsistent with religious\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThe organization, calling itself the American Protective\r\nAssociation, but known popularly as the A. P. A., had its\r\nbranches all over the North.  Its members met in secret,\r\nselected their candidates in secret--generally excluding all\r\nmen who were not known to sympathize with them--and then attended\r\nthe Republican caucuses to support candidates in whose selection\r\nmembers of that political party who were not in their secret\r\ncouncils had no share.  Ambitious candidates for office did\r\nnot like to encounter such a powerful enmity.  They in many\r\ncases temporized or coquetted with the A. P. A. if they\r\ndid not profess to approve its doctrine.  So far as I know,\r\nno prominent Republican in any part of the country put himself\r\npublicly on record as attacking this vicious brotherhood.\r\nMany men who did not agree with it were, doubtless, so strong\r\nin the public esteem that they were not attacked.\r\n\r\nThat was the condition of things when, in the early summer\r\nof 1895, I delivered an address at the opening of the Summer\r\nSchool of Clark University in which I spoke briefly, but in\r\nvery strong terms, in condemnation of the secrecy and of the\r\nproscriptive principles of this political organization.  I\r\ndeclared:  \"I have no patience or tolerance with the spirit\r\nwhich would excite religious strife.  It is as much out of\r\nplace as the witchcraft delusion or the fires of Smithfield.\"\r\nI added:  \"This Nation is a composite.  It is made up of many\r\nstreams, of the twisting and winding of many bands.  The quality,\r\nhope and destiny of our land is expressed in the phrase of\r\nour Fathers, 'E Pluribus Unum'--of many, one--of many States,\r\none Nation--of many races, one people--of many creeds, one\r\nfaith--of many bended knees, one family of God.\" A little\r\nlater I went with the Massachusetts Club, of which I was a\r\nmember, to an outing at Newport.  There, briefly but still\r\nmore emphatically, I called upon the people not to revive\r\nthe bitter memories of ancient, social and religious strife.\r\n\r\nThese two speeches excited the indignation of the leaders\r\nof this organization.  A gentleman named Evans, I believe\r\nborn in England, took up the cudgels.  He was supported by\r\nmany worthy clergymen and a good many newspapers which had\r\nbeen established to support the doctrine of the A. P. A.\r\norganization.  Mr. Evans, if I am right in my memory, claimed\r\nthat he was not a member of the organization.  But he stood\r\nup for it stanchly in two letters to me, in which he very\r\nseverely denounced what I had said, and pointed out the wicked\r\nbehavior of some Catholic priests to whom he referred.  He\r\nsaid he had looked up to me as he formerly did to Charles\r\nSumner and William H. Seward; that my course would tend as\r\nabsolutely to the breaking up of the Republican Party as Daniel\r\nWebster's speech did to the breaking up of the old Whig Party,\r\nand that I had rung my own death knell; that the one mistake\r\nWesley made when he called slavery \"the sum of all villainies\"\r\nwas that he did not except the Roman Catholic Church.  He\r\nadded that there were at least three million members of these\r\npatriotic orders, constituting at least three fifths of the\r\nRepublican Party, and that their membership was being added to\r\ndaily.  Mr. Evans also said, what was absolutely without\r\nfoundation, that I had said, \"We need a Father Confessor.\"\r\n\r\nThat gave me my opportunity.  I answered with the following\r\nletter in which I stated my own doctrine as vigorously and\r\nclearly as I knew how.\r\n\r\nWORCESTER, Aug. 5, 1895.\r\n  T. C. EVANS, ESQ.:\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_--One of the great evils, though by no means\r\nthe greatest evil of secret political societies, is that foolish\r\nand extravagant statements about men who don't agree with\r\nthem get circulated without opportunity for contradiction\r\nor explanation.  You seem to be a well-meaning and intelligent\r\nman; yet I am amazed that any well-meaning and intelligent\r\nman should believe such stuff as you repeat in your letter\r\nof August 3.  I never said, thought or dreamed what you impute\r\nto me.  I don't believe there ever was any report in the Worcester\r\n_Telegram_ to that effect.  Certainly there is none in the\r\nreport of what I said in the summer school at Clark University\r\nthe morning after, and there is no such statement in any of\r\nthe other Worcester newspapers.  I never anywhere expressed\r\nthe idea that there should be a confessional or that there\r\nwas any need of a Father Confessor, or that I wanted to see\r\nsomething in our Protestant churches like the Father Confessor\r\nin the Catholic.  The whole thing is a miserable lie and invention\r\nmade out of whole cloth.  The language, which you quote, about\r\nan attempt to recall on one side, \"the cruelties of the Catholic\r\nChurch and frighten our women and children with horrid hobgoblins,\"\r\nis not my language.  That does appear in the _Telegram_.  But\r\nit is the reporter's statement of what he understood my idea\r\nto be in his own language.  What I said was: \"We are confronted\r\nwith a public danger which comes from an attempt to rouse\r\nthe old feelings of the dark ages, and which ought to have\r\nended with them, between men who have different forms of faith.\r\nIt is an attempt to recall on one side the cruelties of the\r\nCatholic Church and to frighten old women of both sexes, and,\r\non the other side, to band the men of the Catholic Church\r\ntogether for political action.  Both these attempts will fail.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no more zealous believer in the principles of the\r\nNew England Puritans, and no more zealous advocate of them,\r\nthan I am.  There is not a man in Massachusetts who has more\r\nat heart the welfare and perpetuity of our system of free\r\ncommon schools than I have.  I was the first person, so far\r\nas I know, who called public attention to the fact that they\r\nwere in danger, in any formal way.  I drew and had put in\r\nthe platform of the Republican State Convention the following\r\nresolution:  \"The Republican Party ever has maintained and\r\never will maintain and defend, the common schools of Massachusetts\r\nas the very citadel of happiness.  They shall be kept open\r\nto all the children and free from all partisan and sectarian\r\ncontrol.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine I stand by.  And I stand by the further doctrine,\r\nas I stated at length in my address at Clark University, that\r\nthe whole resources of the Commonwealth are pledged to their\r\nsupport, and that that is the bottom mortgage on every dollar\r\nof our property, and that no person can escape or be allowed\r\nto escape that responsibility.  The difference between you\r\nand me is a difference of method.  I want to get the 700,000\r\nCatholics in Massachusetts on our side.  I want them to send\r\ntheir children to the public schools, to pay their share of\r\nthe cost, and when their young men and women are suitable,\r\nare intelligent, liberal persons, attached to the school system,\r\nI want some of them to be employed as teachers.  I don't wish\r\nto exclude them from my political support when they are Republicans\r\nand agree with me in other matters, because of their religious\r\nfaith.  Nor do I wish to exclude them from being public school\r\nteachers, if they will keep their particular religious tenets\r\nout of their instruction, because of their religious faith, any\r\nmore than I would have excluded Phil Sheridan from his office\r\nin the army, or would have refused to support him for any\r\npublic office, if he had been nominated for it.  Further,\r\nI want to state and advocate my opinions in the face of day,\r\nand you may be sure that I shall do this without flinching\r\nbefore anybody's threats or anybody's displeasure or indignation.\r\nYou, on the other hand, I understand, want to go into a cellar\r\nto declare your principles.  You want to join an association\r\nwhose members are ashamed to confess they belong to it; many\r\nof whom, without apparently forfeiting the respect of their\r\nfellows, lie about their membership in it when they are asked\r\nabout it.  You want to mass together the whole Catholic population\r\nof Massachusetts to the support of their extreme and wrong-\r\nheaded priests, if any such can be found.\r\n\r\nThe difference between us is a difference of methods in accomplishing\r\nthe same result.  I think your method would overthrow the\r\ncommon school system, would overthrow the Republican Party,\r\nand would end by massing together all the Catholic voters,\r\nas proscription always does mass men together, to increase\r\nand strengthen that political power which you profess so much\r\nto dread.\r\n\r\nWhen O'Neill, the young Catholic soldier of Worcester, lay\r\ndying, he said:  \"Write to my dear mother and tell her I die\r\nfor my country.  I wish I had two lives to give.  Let the\r\nUnion flag be wrapped around me and a fold of it laid under\r\nmy head.\"  I feel proud that God gave me such a man to be\r\nmy countryman and townsman.  I have very little respect for\r\nthe Americanism that is not moved and stirred by such a story.\r\nIf O'Neill had left a daughter who had her father's spirit,\r\nI would be willing to trust my child or grandchild to her\r\ninstruction in secular education in the public school, even\r\nif the father had kissed with his last breath the cross on\r\nwhich the Saviour died, or even if the parting soul had received\r\ncomfort from the lips of Thomas Conaty or John Power or John\r\nIreland or Archbishop Williams.\r\n\r\nWhen John Boyle O'Reilly, the Catholic poet, sang the praises\r\nof the Pilgrims at Plymouth, in that noblest of odes, when\r\nhe quoted in his preface from William Bradford and John Robinson\r\nand Robert Cushman, I was glad to hear what he said, especially\r\nwhen he quoted from the lips of the clergyman Robinson: \"I\r\ncharge you before God that you follow me no further than you\r\nhave seen me follow the Lord Jesus Christ.  If God reveal\r\nanything to you by any other instrument of His, be as ready\r\nto receive it as ever you were to receive any truth by my\r\nministry, for I am verily persuaded, I am very confident,\r\nthe Lord hath more truths yet to break forth out of His Holy\r\nWord.\"  I liked what he said.  If I understand your former\r\nletter correctly, you didn't.  That is where we differ.  When\r\nJohn Boyle O'Reilly said, declaring the very spirit of New\r\nEngland Puritanism, and speaking of religious faith, \"the\r\none sacred revolution is change of mind,\" when he spoke these\r\nnoble lines:\r\n\r\n  So held they firm, the Fathers aye to be,\r\n  From Home to Holland, Holland to the sea--\r\n  Pilgrims for manhood, in their little ship,\r\n  Hope in each heart, and prayer on every lip.\r\n  Apart from all--unique, unworldly, true,\r\n  Selected grain to sow the earth anew;\r\n  A winnowed part--a saving remnant they;\r\n  Dreamers who work; adventurers who pray!\r\n  We know them by the exile that was theirs;\r\n  Their justice, faith and fortitude attest.\r\n\r\nWhen he further said:\r\n\r\n  On the wintry main\r\n  God flings their lives as farmers scatter grain,\r\n  His breath propels the winged seed afloat;\r\n  His tempests swerve to spare the fragile boat;\r\n  Here on this rock and on this sterile soil,\r\n  Began the kingdom, not of kings, but men;\r\n  Began the making of the world again,\r\n  Their primal code of liberty, their rules\r\n  Of civil right; their churches, courts and schools;\r\n  Their freedom's very secret here laid down--\r\n  The spring of government is the little town!\r\n  On their strong lines, we base our social health--\r\n  The man--the home--the town--the Commonwealth;\r\n  Their saintly Robinson was left behind\r\n  To teach by gentle memory; to shame\r\n  The bigot spirit and the word of flame;\r\n  To write dear mercy in the Pilgrim's law;\r\n  To lead to that wide faith his soul foresaw--\r\n\r\nI liked what he said.  If I understand your former letter,\r\nyou didn't.  You don't want a man who differs from you saying\r\nor thinking such things.  I want the whole 700,000 Catholics\r\nof Massachusetts to believe what John Boyle O'Reilly believed,\r\nand to love and reverence the Puritan founders of Massachusetts\r\nas he did, and I think my way is the way to make them do it.\r\nYou don't, if I understand you.  You think the way to make\r\ngood citizens and good men of them and to attract them to\r\nProtestantism, is to exclude them, their sons and daughters,\r\nfrom all public employment and to go yourself into a dark\r\ncellar and curse at them through the gratings of the windows.\r\n\r\nI stated my religious faith and my ideas of the relation\r\nof our religious denominations to each other, in an address\r\nI delivered at Saratoga last year, of which I send you a\r\ncopy, and which I hope, as you have kindly volunteered to\r\nsend me so much of your opinion, you may perhaps be willing\r\nto read.  It doesn't become me to say anything about it myself.\r\nI am deeply sensible of its imperfections.  It fails to do\r\njustice to what is in my own heart.  But perhaps I may be\r\npermitted to say that within a few weeks after it was delivered,\r\nan eminent Catholic clergyman sent me a message expressing\r\nhis delight in it.  The most famous Episcopalian Bishop in\r\nthe country said to a friend of mine that he had read it with\r\ngreat pleasure and that it sounded to him like the old times.\r\nA Baptist minister, bearing one of the most distinguished\r\nnames in the country, wrote me a letter, in which he said,\r\nas he read it, \"At every sentence, I said to myself, Amen,\r\nAmen.\"  An eminent Orthodox minister, Doctor of Divinity,\r\nread it aloud to his parish, in full, instead of his Sunday's\r\nsermon.  And a very excellent and able Methodist minister\r\nwrote to me and said, \"If that is Unitarianism, I am afraid\r\nI am a Unitarian.\"  I think the time has come to throw down\r\nthe walls between Christians and not to build new ones.  I\r\nthink the time has come to inculcate harmony and good will\r\nbetween all American citizens, especially between all citizens\r\nof the old Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nYou quote some expressions which you attribute to Catholic\r\nclergymen.  If you don't get any nearer right in quoting\r\nthem than you do in quoting me, I don't believe that they\r\never said any such thing.  If they have, they never will\r\npersuade any considerable number of Catholic laity in this\r\ncountry, in this nineteenth century, to follow them.  You may\r\nperhaps induce the Catholic young men and women of Massachusetts\r\nto believe there is something in what those clergymen say.\r\nThey never will succeed in doing it themselves.\r\n\r\nI don't think you will succeed in getting any considerable\r\nnumber of the people of this country, who are able to read\r\nand write, or to count ten on their fingers, to believe that, as\r\nI am entering my seventieth year, I am actuated by any personal\r\nambition, in the counsel which I give my fellow citizens.\r\nI don't think you will get them to believe that, if I were\r\nso actuated, I should begin by saying anything which would\r\nestrange a considerable number of the Protestant Republican\r\ncitizens of Massachusetts.  I don't think you will convince\r\nthem that I am indifferent to the good will of so large a\r\nportion of the American people as are said to be enlisted\r\nin the ranks of the secret society to which you refer.  If\r\nyou know as little of your Catholic fellow citizens as you\r\nknow of me, you have a good deal as yet to learn of the subject\r\nof which you are speaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you may be quite sure I should be unwilling\r\nto do injustice to any of my fellow citizens.  They will hardly\r\nneed be assured that I would not lightly or unnecessarily\r\nincur their disapprobation.  But you may perhaps think it\r\npardonable that I should not be thoroughly informed as to\r\nthe principles, motives or conduct of a secret society.  As\r\nyou have undertaken the duty of giving me information, will\r\nyou kindly answer for me the following questions:\r\n\r\n1st.  Is the organization to which you refer a secret organization?\r\nAre its discussions in the face of day?  Do the persons whose\r\npolitical errors they especially oppose have an opportunity\r\nto know their purposes and to be convinced by their arguments?\r\nIf the organization be in any respect secret, why is it deemed\r\nnecessary to maintain such secrecy in the United States of\r\nAmerica and at the close of the nineteenth century?\r\n\r\n2d.  Is it the custom of many persons who belong to it to\r\ndeny, when inquired of, that they are members of such an\r\nassociation?  And if this be true, does such a falsehood cost\r\nthem the respect and friendship of their associates or diminish\r\ntheir influence in the order?\r\n\r\n3d.  Do members of the association, after joining it, retain\r\ntheir membership in other political parties?  Do they agree\r\ntogether upon candidates for office or delegates to conventions\r\nto nominate officers and then go into their party caucuses\r\nto support such delegates agreed upon in secret, without consultation\r\nwith their political brethren? If that be true, does it seem\r\nto you that that course is honest?\r\n\r\n4th.  Do you understand that any considerable number of Catholic\r\nlaymen, in this country, accept the interpretation which you\r\nput upon the fifteen articles which you quote as principles\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church?  Is it not true that the interpretation\r\nis absolutely rejected by the Catholic laity in general, and\r\nthat they affirm for themselves as absolute independence of\r\nthe Pope or of the clergy in all secular matters as you or\r\nI claim for ourselves in regard to Protestant clergymen?\r\n\r\n5th.  Are not Italy and France, two Catholic countries, to-\r\nday as absolutely free from any temporal power or influence\r\nof the Pope or the Catholic clergy as is Massachusetts?\r\n\r\n6th.  I have had sent me a little leaflet, purporting to be\r\nthe principles of the American Protective Association, which\r\nyou doubtless have seen.  When you say, in your third article,\r\nthat the American Protective Association is \"opposed to the\r\nholding of offices in the National, State or municipal Government,\r\nby any subject or supporter of such ecclesiastical power,\"\r\nand in your fifth article, that you \"protest against the employment\r\nof the subjects of any un-American ecclesiastical power as\r\nofficers or teachers of our public schools,\" do you mean,\r\nor no, that no Catholic shall hold such National or State\r\nor municipal office, and that no Catholic shall be a teacher\r\nin a public school?  You don't answer this question by quoting\r\nthe language of church officials in by-gone days or the intemperate\r\nlanguage of some priests in recent times.  It is a practical\r\nquestion.  Do you or don't you mean to exclude from such office\r\nand from such employment as teachers the bulk of the Catholic\r\npopulation of Massachusetts?\r\n\r\n7th.  Is it you opinion that General Philip H. Sheridan,\r\nwere he living, would be unfit to hold civil or military office\r\nin this country?  Or that his daughter, if she entertained\r\nthe religious belief of her father, should be disqualified from\r\nbeing a teacher in a public school?\r\n\r\nI have no pride of opinion.  I shall be very glad to revise\r\nany opinion of mine and, as you state it, I shall be very\r\nglad to \"know better in the future,\" if you will kindly enlighten\r\nme.\r\n\r\nYou and I, as I have said, have the same object at heart.\r\nWe desire, above all things, the maintenance of the principles\r\nof civil and religious liberty; and above all other instrumentalities\r\nto that end, the maintenance of our common school system,\r\nat the public charge, open to all the children and free from\r\npartisan or sectarian control.  If you and I differ, it is\r\nonly as to what is the best means of accomplishing these\r\nends.  If you think that they are best accomplished by secret\r\nsocieties, by hiding from the face of day, by men who will\r\nnot acknowledge what they are doing, and by refusing public\r\nemployment to men and women who think on these subjects exactly\r\nas we do, but whose religious faith differs from ours, then\r\nI don't agree with you.  I think your method will result\r\nin driving and compacting together, in solid mass, persons\r\nwho will soon number nearly or quite fifty per cent. of the\r\nvoting population of Massachusetts.  Nothing strengthens\r\nmen, nothing makes them so hard to hear reason, nothing so\r\ndrives them to extremity in opinion or in action as persecution\r\nor proscription.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my method is the method of absolute freedom\r\nand of pure reason.  The Catholic boy, who has grown up in\r\nour common schools, who had formed his youthful friendships\r\nwith his Protestant classmates, whose daughter or sister,\r\nas he grows older, is employed as a teacher, will very soon\r\nbe attached to our common school system as we are ourselves.\r\nHe will be required, as he gets property, to pay his share\r\nof his support.  He cannot ask to be exempt from a tax to\r\nwhich all Protestants cheerfully submit, whether their own\r\nchildren be in the schools or not, and he will not easily\r\nbe made to give his consent to paying twice.  The American\r\nSpirit, the Spirit of the age, the Spirit of Liberty, the\r\nSpirit of Equality, especially what Roger Williams called\r\n\"Soul Liberty\" is able to maintain herself in a fair field\r\nand in a free contest against all comers.  Do not compel her\r\nto fight in a cellar.  Do not compel her to breathe the damp,\r\nmalarial atmosphere of dark places.  Especially let no member\r\nof the Republican Party, the last child of freedom, lend his\r\naid to such an effort.  The atmosphere of the Republic is\r\nthe air of the mountain top and the sunlight and the open\r\nfield.  Her emblem is the eagle and not the bat.\r\n\r\n  I am faithfully yours,\r\n  GEORGE F. HOAR.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the foregoing letter, I received\r\none from Theodore Roosevelt, who was holding a high office\r\nin New York City, then at the beginning of his illustrious\r\npolitical career.  He expressed his hearty sympathy and approval,\r\nand offered to lay aside everything else and come to my aid,\r\nif I so desired.  I need not say I took special pleasure in\r\nthis letter, which disclosed so unmistakably the honest and\r\nbrave heart of the man, who was then in his difficult office\r\nfighting wild beasts at Ephesus.  But I did not need to accept\r\nhis offer.\r\n\r\nI was angrily denounced.  But the leading Republican papers\r\nsoon came to my support.  The Republican political leaders\r\ngenerally, though quietly, approved what I had said and done.\r\nThe generous and just heart of the American people was stirred,\r\nand the result was that the movement, inspired by bigotry\r\nand intolerance, lost its force, languished for a year or\r\ntwo, and was little heard of afterward.\r\n\r\nI dare say that the same causes which excited it may provoke\r\na similar movement more than once hereafter.  But I believe\r\nit will fail as that failed.\r\n\r\nI know how prone men are, especially old men, in telling\r\nthe story of their lives, to over-estimate the value and the\r\nconsequence of the things in which they have taken a part.\r\nBut I think I am not extravagant in claiming that the overthrow\r\nof this dangerous delusion was of great value not only to\r\nthe Republican Party, but to the cause of religious liberty\r\nin this country, and that the success of the A. P. A. would\r\nhave been the destruction of both.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\nTHE ENGLISH MISSION\r\n\r\nI may as well put on record here a matter which I suppose\r\nhas never been made public.  When in President Hayes's time\r\nMr. Welsh resigned the English Mission, Mr. Lowell, then in\r\nSpain, was strongly recommended for the place.  Mr. Evarts,\r\nSecretary of State, was quite unwilling to have Mr. Lowell\r\nappointed.  I fancied that Mr. Evarts might have been influenced\r\nsomewhat by his reluctance to appoint a Harvard man.  He was\r\nan exceedingly pleasant-natured man, with no bitterness in\r\nhim.  But he entered with a good deal of zeal into the not\r\nunhealthy rivalry between the two famous Universities, Harvard\r\nand Yale.  Of course I did not like that notion.  President\r\nHayes had an exceedingly friendly feeling for Harvard.  He\r\nhad studied at the Harvard Law School, and later had the degree\r\nof Doctor of Laws there.  Mr. Lowell hesitated about accepting\r\nthe duty.  I said to the President:  \"In the matter of the\r\nEnglish Mission, if Mr. Lowell declines, I have a suggestion\r\nto make which Mr. Evarts, I am afraid, won't like very well.\r\nBut I wish to ask you to consider it, Evarts or no Evarts.\"\r\nMy relations with both of them made this familiar and half-\r\nboyish style of dealing with so important a matter not unbecoming.\r\n\"I think President Eliot would be an excellent person for\r\nsuch a service.  It is understood that he is somewhat out\r\nof health.  I think if he should go to England for a year\r\nor two, and take a vacation from his duties at the College,\r\nit would reflect great credit on your Administration and on\r\nthe country, and he would return to his duties at Harvard\r\nwith renewed health and added reputation and capacity for\r\nusefulness.\"  Mr. Hayes did not quite commit himself.  But\r\nhe expressed his very emphatic approval of the idea, and said\r\nhe guessed it might be brought to pass.  But I had, at his\r\nrequest, sent a cable to Mr. Lowell who was then in Spain,\r\nurging him to take the place.  He was then hesitating, but\r\nfinally, as is well known, consented.\r\n\r\nI was on the friendliest terms with President Hayes.  As I\r\nhave already said he was good enough to offer me the office\r\nof Attorney-General, when the appointment of Devens to the\r\nCircuit Court was under consideration.\r\n\r\nI had already, before that time, received from Mr. Evarts,\r\nSecretary of State, the offer of the English Mission, as I\r\nhave said in another place, when Mr. Welsh resigned.\r\n\r\nI may as well state here, although it belongs to a later\r\ntime, that the offer was made to me again, by President McKinley.\r\nI give the correspondence with President McKinley when he\r\nmade me that offer:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n  September 13, 1898.\r\n  HON. GEORGE F. HOAR (Confidential),\r\n  WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nIt would give me much satisfaction to appoint you Ambassador\r\nto London.  Will it be agreeable to you?\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM MCKINLEY.\r\n\r\nSeptember 14, 1898.\r\n  TO THE PRESIDENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nI am highly honored by your confidence, for which I am grateful.\r\nBut I believe I can better serve my country, and better support\r\nyour Administration by continuing to discharge the legislative\r\nduties to which I have been accustomed for thirty years, than\r\nby undertaking new responsibilities at my age, now past seventy-\r\ntwo.  If it were otherwise, I cannot afford to maintain the\r\nscale of living which the social customs of London make almost\r\nindispensable to an Ambassador, and I have no right to impose\r\nupon my wife, in her present state of health, the burden which\r\nwould fall upon her.  Be assured of my warm personal regard\r\nand of my desire to stand by you in the difficult and trying\r\nperiod which is before you.\r\n\r\n  GEO. F. HOAR\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\nPRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AND THE SYRIAN CHILDREN\r\n\r\nA very touching incident, characteristic of the kind heart\r\nof President Roosevelt, ought to be put on record in connection\r\nwith his visit to Worcester.\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas holidays of 1901 a very well known Syrian,\r\na man of high standing and character, came into my son's office\r\nand told him this story:\r\n\r\nA neighbor and countryman of his had a few years before emigrated\r\nto the United States and established himself in Worcester.\r\nSoon afterward, he formally declared his intention of becoming\r\nan American citizen.  After a while, he amassed a little money\r\nand sent to his wife, whom he had left in Syria, the necessary\r\nfunds to convey her and their little girl and boy to Worcester.\r\nShe sold her furniture and whatever other belongings she had,\r\nand went across Europe to France, where they sailed from one\r\nof the northern ports on a German steamer for New York.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival at New York, it appeared that the children\r\nhad contracted a disease of the eyelids, which the doctors\r\nof the Immigration Bureau declared to be trachoma, which is\r\ncontagious, and in adults incurable.  It was ordered that\r\nthe mother might land, but that the children must be sent\r\nback in the ship upon which they arrived, on the following\r\nThursday.  This would have resulted in sending them back as\r\npaupers, as the steamship company, compelled to take them\r\nas passengers free of charge, would have given them only such\r\nfood as was left by the sailors, and would have dumped them\r\nout in France to starve, or get back as beggars to Syria.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the mother might land was only a cruel\r\nmockery.  Joseph J. George, a worthy citizen of Worcester,\r\nbrought the facts of the case to the attention of my son,\r\nwho in turn brought them to my attention.  My son had meantime\r\nadvised that a bond be offered to the Immigration authorities\r\nto save them harmless from any trouble on account of the children.\r\n\r\nI certified these facts to the authorities and received a\r\nstatement in reply that the law was peremptory, and that it\r\nrequired that the children be sent home; that trouble had\r\ncome from making like exceptions theretofore; that the Government\r\nhospitals were full of similar cases, and the authorities\r\nmust enforce the law strictly in the future.  Thereupon I\r\naddressed a telegram to the Immigration Bureau at Washington,\r\nbut received an answer that nothing could be done for the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThen I telegraphed the facts to Senator Lodge, who went in\r\nperson to the Treasury Department, but could get no more\r\nfavorable reply.  Senator Lodge's telegram announcing their\r\nrefusal was received in Worcester Tuesday evening, and repeated\r\nto me in Boston just as I was about to deliver an address\r\nbefore the Catholic College there.  It was too late to do\r\nanything that night.  Early Wednesday morning, the day before\r\nthe children were to sail, when they were already on the ship,\r\nI sent the following dispatch to President Roosevelt:\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT, WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nI appeal to your clear understanding and kind and brave heart\r\nto interpose your authority to prevent an outrage which will\r\ndishonor the country and create a foul blot on the American\r\nflag.  A neighbor of mine in Worcester, Mass., a Syrian by\r\nbirth, made some time ago his public declaration for citizenship.\r\nHe is an honest, hard-working and in every way respectable\r\nman.  His wife with two small children have reached New York.\r\n\r\nHe sent out the money to pay their passage.  The children\r\ncontracted a disorder of the eyes on the ship.  The Treasury\r\nauthorities say that the mother may land but the children\r\ncannot, and they are to be sent back Thursday.  Ample bond\r\nhas been offered and will be furnished to save the Government\r\nand everybody from injury or loss.  I do not think such a\r\nthing ought to happen under your Administration, unless you\r\npersonally decide that the case is without remedy.  I am told\r\nthe authorities say they have been too easy heretofore, and\r\nmust draw the line now.  That shows they admit the power to\r\nmake exceptions in proper cases.  Surely, an exception should\r\nbe made in the case of little children of a man lawfully here,\r\nand who has duly and in good faith declared his intention\r\nto become a citizen.  The immigration law was never intended\r\nto repeal any part of the naturalization laws which provide\r\nthat the minor children get all the rights of the father as\r\nto citizenship.  My son knows the friends of this man personally\r\nand that they are highly respectable and well off.  If our\r\nlaws require this cruelty, it is time for a revolution, and\r\nyou are just the man to head it.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE F. HOAR.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour from the receipt of that dispatch at the White\r\nHouse Wednesday forenoon, Theodore Roosevelt, President of\r\nthe United States, sent a peremptory order to New York to\r\nlet the children come in.  They have entirely recovered from\r\nthe disorder of the eyes, which turned out not to be contagious,\r\nbut only caused by the glare of the water, or the hardships\r\nof the voyage.  The children are fair-haired, with blue eyes,\r\nand of great personal beauty, and would be exhibited with\r\npride by any American mother.\r\n\r\nWhen the President came to Worcester he expressed a desire\r\nto see the children.  They came to meet him at my house, dressed\r\nup in their best and glorious to behold.  The President was\r\nvery much interested in them, and said when what he had done\r\nwas repeated in his presence, that he was just beginning to\r\nget angry.\r\n\r\nThe result of this incident was that I had a good many similar\r\napplications for relief in behalf of immigrants coming in\r\nwith contagious diseases.  Some of them were meritorious,\r\nand others untrustworthy.  In the December session of 1902\r\nI procured the following amendment to be inserted in the immigration\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever an alien shall have taken up his permanent residence\r\nin this country and shall have filed his preliminary declaration\r\nto become a citizen and thereafter shall send for his wife\r\nor minor children to join him, if said wife or either of said\r\nchildren shall be found to be affected with any contagious\r\ndisorder, and it seems that said disorder was contracted on\r\nboard the ship in which they came, such wife or children shall\r\nbe held under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nshall prescribe until it shall be determined whether the disorder\r\nwill be easily curable or whether they can be permitted to\r\nland without danger to other persons; and they shall not be\r\ndeported until such facts have been ascertained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\nNATIONAL BANKRUPTCY\r\n\r\nI have, since I have been in the Senate, taken great interest\r\nin the passage of a bill for a system of National Bankruptcy.\r\nThe Constitution gives Congress power to establish a uniform\r\nsystem of Bankruptcy.  The people of Massachusetts, a commercial\r\nand manufacturing State from the beginning, have always desired\r\na Bankrupt law.  They were large dealers with other States\r\nand with other countries.  Insolvent debtors in Massachusetts\r\ncould not get discharge from their debts contracted in such\r\ndealings.  The Massachusetts creditors having debts against\r\ninsolvents in other States found that their debtors under\r\nthe laws of those States either got preferences or made fraudulent\r\nassignments which they could not detect or prevent.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bankruptcy laws have always been unpopular\r\nin many parts of the country.  The Democrat who strictly construed\r\nthe Constitution did not like to see this power of Congress\r\nvigorously exercised.  The National Courts, who must administer\r\nsuch laws, were always the object of jealousy and suspicion\r\nin the South and West.  The people did not like to be summoned\r\nto attend the settlement of an estate in bankruptcy, hundreds\r\nand hundreds of miles, to the place where the United States\r\nCourt was sitting, in States like Texas or Missouri.  The\r\nsympathy of many communities is apt to be with the debtor,\r\nand not with the creditors, who were represented as harpies\r\nor vultures preying on the flesh of their unfortunate victims.\r\nA good example of this prejudice will be found in an extract\r\nfrom the speech of Senator Ingalls, of Kansas.  He said in\r\ndefending what was known as the equity scheme:\r\n\r\n\"The opposition arose first, from the great wholesale merchants\r\nin the chief distributing centres of the country.  They have\r\ntheir agents and attorneys in the vicinity of every debtor,\r\nobtaining early information of approaching disaster, and ready\r\nto avail themselves of the local machinery of State courts\r\nby attachment or by preferences, through which they can secure\r\nfull payment of their claims, to the exclusion of less powerful\r\nor less vigilant but equally meritorious creditors.  Naturally\r\nthey want no Bankrupt law of any description.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  From the disabled veterans of the old army registers;\r\nfrom the professional assignees and wreckers of estates, who,\r\nby exorbitant fees and collusive sales of assets to convenient\r\nfavorites, plundered debtor and creditor alike and made the\r\nsystem an engine of larceny and confiscation.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  From those who desire, instead of a system for the\r\ndischarge of honest but unfortunate debtors upon the surrender\r\nof their estates, a criminal code and a thumb-screw machine\r\nfor the collection of doubtful and desperate debts.  They\r\ncovet a return to the primitive practices which prevailed\r\nin Rome, when the debtor was sold into slavery or had his\r\nbody cut into pieces and distributed pro rata among his creditors.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  From those timid and cautious conservatives who\r\nbelieve that nothing is valuable that is not venerable.\r\n\r\n\"Like the statesman described by Macaulay, they prefer to\r\nperish by precedent rather than be saved by innovation.  They\r\nadhere to ancient failures rather than incur the risk of success\r\nthrough venture and experiment.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  From Boards of Trade, Chambers of Commerce and other\r\nornamental organizations who, being entirely uninformed on\r\nthe subject, permit themselves to become the conduits through\r\nwhich the misrepresentation and animosity of avaricious creditors\r\nand rapacious attorneys are discharged upon Congress and the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nI had moved in the Senate, in 1882, a bill favored by the\r\nmerchants and manufacturers of Massachusetts, which was largely\r\nthe work of Judge John Lowell, of the United States Circuit\r\nCourt, one of the most accomplished lawyers of his day, as\r\nan amendment to a bill which Mr. Edmunds, Mr. Davis and Mr.\r\nIngalls had reported as a Subcommittee to the Senate Judiciary\r\nCommittee, and which had been reported from that Committee\r\nto the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Lowell Bill was on my motion substituted for the report\r\nof the Judiciary Committee, by a majority of three.  This\r\nbill was extensively discussed in June and December.  But\r\nI was unable to secure its passage.  It passed the Senate,\r\nbut it did not get through the House.\r\n\r\nI have had the Parliamentary charge of all Bankruptcy measures\r\nin the Senate from that time.  After the failure of the Lowell\r\nBill, the Boards of Trade and Chambers of Commerce, and other\r\nlike associations throughout the country, took up the matter\r\nvery zealously by employing an able lawyer, the Hon. Jay\r\nL. Torrey of Missouri, to present the matter in the two Houses\r\nof Congress.  He was thoroughly acquainted with the principles\r\nand history of Bankruptcy laws in this country and England.\r\nBut he had no compromise in him.  He insisted on the Bill\r\nwhich he drew, which was a modification of the Lowell Bill,\r\nwithout being willing to make any concession to objection\r\nor difference of opinion in Congress, or out of it.  He said\r\nhe would have a perfect law, or none at all.  The measure\r\nas he drew it was apparently very austere and harsh to the\r\ndebtor.  It enumerated a large number of offences for which\r\nthe debtor was to be punished by fine and imprisonment, and\r\nby a denial of his discharge.  Mr. Torrey's provisions were\r\nnot very unreasonable.  But they made it seem as if the Bill\r\nwere a penal code for the punishment of fraudulent debtors.\r\nA simple provision that any debtor who wilfully should make\r\nfalse answer to any question lawfully put to him by the Court,\r\nor who wilfully concealed or attempted to conceal any property\r\nfrom his assignee should lose his discharge and be punished\r\nwith a proper and moderate punishment, would have answered\r\nthe whole purpose.  I take some blame to myself for not insisting\r\nmore strenuously upon modifying Mr. Torrey's measure.  But\r\nhe constantly visited different Senators and Representatives\r\nand came back to me with glowing accounts of the prospects\r\nof the Bill, and of their promises to support the Bill.  He\r\nwas also the agent of the business organizations of the country\r\nwho had passed resolutions in favor of the measure as he had\r\ndrawn it.  It seemed to me therefore that if I should get\r\nthe Bill amended and then it got lost, I should incur the\r\ngreat reproach of having obstinately set up my judgment against\r\nthat of this large number of the ablest men in the country,\r\nwho were so deeply interested in the matter.  So the Bill,\r\nthough brought up and pressed Congress after Congress, failed\r\nuntil Mr. Torrey enlisted in the Spanish War.\r\n\r\nI then introduced a Bill in a softened and modified form.\r\nIt was attacked in that form by Senator Nelson of Minnesota,\r\na very excellent lawyer and gentleman of great influence,\r\nin the Senate.  He succeeded in having the Bill modified\r\nand softened still more.  The Bill then passed and went to\r\nthe House which, under the leadership of the Judiciary Committee,\r\nsubstituted the original Bill.\r\n\r\nMr. Nelson and I, with Mr. Lindsay of Kentucky, were put on\r\nthe Conference Committee in the Senate, with Mr. Henderson,\r\nafterward Speaker, Mr. Ray of New York, now Judge of the\r\nU. S. District Court, and Mr. Terry of Missouri, on the part\r\nof the House.  We struggled nearly the whole winter.  Mr.\r\nNelson and Mr. Ray took the burden of the contest upon their\r\nshoulders.  Their attempts at compromise reminded their brethren\r\nof the old scientific problem--\"What will happen when an irresistible\r\nforce encounters an immovable obstacle.\" But both gentlemen,\r\neach exceedingly firm in his own opinion when he thought he\r\nwas in the right, were wise and reasonable and conscientious\r\nmen.  So at last they agreed upon the present Bankruptcy\r\nBill, which became a law July 1, 1898.  It was on the whole\r\nsatisfactory to the country, except for one clause in it, which\r\nwas interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in a manner\r\ncontrary to the understanding and expectation of the framers\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\nA law was passed February 7, 1903, correcting this and some\r\nminor defects.  It is hoped, though we cannot be sure in\r\nsuch a matter, that a permanent system of Bankruptcy, so\r\nessential to all commercial, indeed to all civilized nations, is\r\nnow established, and will be maintained in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\nTHE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS\r\n\r\nIt has been my singular ill fortune that I have been compelled\r\nto differ from the Republican Party, and from a good many\r\nof my political associates, upon many important matters.\r\n\r\nIt has been my singular good fortune that, so far, they have\r\nall come to my way of thinking, as have the majority of the\r\nAmerican people, in regard to every one, with perhaps one\r\nexception.  That is the dealing of the American people with\r\nthe people of the Philippine Islands, by the Treaty with Spain.\r\nThe war that followed it crushed the Republic that the Philippine\r\npeople had set up for themselves, deprived them of their independence,\r\nand established there, by American power, a Government in\r\nwhich the people have no part, against their will.  No man,\r\nI think, will seriously question that that action was contrary\r\nto the Declaration of Independence, the fundamental principles\r\ndeclared in many State constitutions, the principles avowed\r\nby the founders of the Republic and by our statesmen of all\r\nparties down to a time long after the death of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIf the question were, whether I am myself right, or whether\r\nmy friends and companions in the Republican Party be right,\r\nI should submit to their better judgment.  But I feel quite\r\nconfident, though of that no man can be certain, that if the\r\njudgment of the American people, even in this generation,\r\ncould be taken on that question alone, I should find myself\r\nin the majority.  If it be not so, the issue is between the\r\nopinion of the American people for more than a century, and\r\nthe opinion that the American people has expressed for one\r\nor two Presidential terms.\r\n\r\nSurely I do not need to argue the question; at any rate, I\r\nwill not here undertake to argue the question, that our dealing\r\nwith the Philippine people is a violation of the principles\r\nto which our people adhered from 1776 to 1893.  If the maintenance\r\nof slavery were inconsistent with them, it was admitted that\r\nin that particular we were violating them, or were unable\r\nfrom circumstances to carry them into effect.  Mr. Jefferson\r\nthought so himself.\r\n\r\nBut the accomplishment by this Republic of its purpose to\r\nsubjugate the Philippine people to its will, under the claim\r\nthat it, and not they, had the right to judge of their fitness\r\nfor self-government, is a rejection of the old American doctrine\r\nas applicable to any race we may judge to be our inferior.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine will be applied hereafter, unless it be abandoned,\r\nto the Negro at home.  Senator Tillman of South Carolina well\r\nsaid, and no gentleman in the Senate contradicted him: \"Republican\r\nleaders do not longer dare to call into question the justice\r\nor the necessity of limiting Negro suffrage in the South.\"\r\nThe same gentleman said at another time: \"I want to call your\r\nattention to the remarkable change that has come over the\r\nspirit of the dream of the Republicans.  Your slogans of the\r\npast--brotherhood of man and fatherhood of God--have gone\r\nglimmering down through the ages.  The brotherhood of man\r\nexists no longer.\" These statements of Mr. Tillman have never\r\nbeen challenged, and never can be.\r\n\r\nI do not mean here to renew the almost interminable debate.\r\nI will only make a very brief statement of my position:\r\n\r\nThe discussion began with the acquisition of Hawaii.  Ever\r\nsince I came to the Senate I had carefully studied the matter\r\nof the acquisition of Hawaii.  I had become thoroughly satisfied\r\nthat it would be a great advantage to the people of the United\r\nStates, as well as for the people of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nHawaii is 2,100 miles from our Pacific coast.  Yet if a line\r\nbe drawn from the point of our territory nearest Asia to the\r\nSouthern boundary of California, that line being the chord\r\nof which our Pacific coast is the bow, Hawaii will fall this\r\nside of it.  Held by a great Nation with whom we were at war,\r\nit would be a most formidable and valuable base of supplies.\r\nWe had sustained a peculiar relation to it.  American missionaries\r\nhad redeemed the people from barbarism and Paganism.  Many\r\nof them, and their descendants, had remained in the Islands.\r\nThe native Hawaiians were a perishing race.  They had gone\r\ndown from 300,000 to 30,000 within one hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese wanted it.  The Portugese wanted it.  Other nations\r\nwanted it.  But the Hawaiians seemed neither to know nor care\r\nwhether they wanted it or no.  They were a perishing people.\r\nTheir only hope and desire and expectation was that in the\r\nProvidence of God they might lead a quiet, undisturbed life,\r\nfishing, bathing, supplied with tropical fruits, and be let\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWe had always insisted that our relation to them was peculiar;\r\nthat they could not be permitted to fall under the dominion\r\nof another power, even by their own consent.  That had been\r\ndeclared by our Department of State under Administrations\r\nof all parties, including Mr. Webster, Mr. Seward, and Mr.\r\nBayard.  They were utterly helpless.  As their Queen has lately\r\ndeclared:  \"The best thing for them that could have happened\r\nwas to belong to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of Hawaii, the Government had been authorized\r\nto make a treaty of annexation with this country.  It was\r\nsaid that that Constitution was the result of usurpation which\r\nwould not have come to pass but for American aid, and the\r\npresence of one of our men-of-war.  But that Government had\r\nbeen maintained for six or seven years.  Four of them were\r\nwhile Mr. Cleveland was President, who it was well known would\r\nbe in full sympathy with an attempt to restore the old Government.\r\nSo if the people had been against it, the Government under\r\nthat Constitution could not have lasted an hour.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison had negotiated a treaty of annexation,\r\nagainst which no considerable remonstrance or opposition\r\nwas uttered.  My approval of it was then, I suppose, well\r\nknown.  Certainly no friend of mine, and nobody in Massachusetts,\r\nso far as I know, in the least objected or remonstrated against\r\nit.  The treaty was withdrawn from the consideration of the\r\nSenate by President Cleveland.\r\n\r\nAnother was negotiated soon after President McKinley came\r\nin.  Meantime, however, the controversy with Spain had assumed\r\nformidable proportions, and the craze for an extension of\r\nour Empire had begun its course.  Many Republican leaders\r\nwere advocating the acquisition of the Hawaiian Islands, not\r\nfor the reasons I have just stated, but on the avowed ground\r\nthat it was necessary we should own them as a point of vantage\r\nfor acquiring dominion in the East.  It was said that China\r\nwas about to be divided among the great Western powers, and\r\nthat we must have our share.  I saw when the time approached\r\nfor action of the McKinley Treaty that the question could\r\nnot be separated, at least in debate, from the question of\r\nentering upon a career of conquest of Empire in the Far East.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the question of duty came to me:\r\nWill you adhere to the purpose long formed, and vote for the\r\nacquisition of Hawaii solely on its own merit?  Or, will you\r\nvote against it, for fear that the bad and mischievous reasons\r\nthat are given for it is so many quarters, will have a pernicious\r\ntendency only to be counteracted by the defeat of the treaty\r\nitself?\r\n\r\nI hesitated long.  President McKinley sent for me to come\r\nto the White House, as was his not infrequent habit.  He said\r\nhe wanted to consult me upon the question whether it would\r\nbe wise for him to have a personal interview with Senator\r\nMorrill of Vermont.  He had been told that Mr. Morrill was\r\nopposed to the Treaty.  The President said: \"I do not quite\r\nlike to try to influence the action of an old gentleman like\r\nMr. Morrill, so excellent, and of such great experience.  It\r\nseems to me that it might be thought presumptuous, if I were\r\nto do so.  But it is very important to us to have his vote,\r\nif we can.\"  The President added something implying that he\r\nunderstood that I was in favor of the Treaty.\r\n\r\nI said, \"I ought to say, Mr. President, in all candor, that\r\nI feel very doubtful whether I can support it myself.\" President\r\nMcKinley said:  \"Well, I don't know what I shall do.  We cannot\r\nlet those Islands go to Japan.  Japan has her eye on them.\r\nHer people are crowding in there.  I am satisfied they do\r\nnot go there voluntarily, as ordinary immigrants, but that\r\nJapan is pressing them in there, in order to get possession\r\nbefore anybody can interfere.  If something be not done, there\r\nwill be before long another Revolution, and Japan will get\r\ncontrol.  Some little time ago the Hawaiian Government observed\r\nthat when the immigrants from a large steamer went ashore\r\nthey marched with a military step, indicating that they were\r\na body of trained soldiers.  Thereupon Hawaii prohibited the\r\nfurther coming in of Japanese.  Japan claimed that was in\r\nviolation of their treaty, and sent a ship of war to Hawaii.\r\nI was obliged to notify Japan that no compulsory measures\r\nupon Hawaii, in behalf of the Japan Government, would be tolerated\r\nby this country.  So she desisted.  But the matters are still\r\nin a very dangerous position, and Japan is doubtless awaiting\r\nher opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nI told President McKinley that I favored then, as I always\r\nhad, the acquisition of Hawaii.  But I did not like the spirit\r\nwith which it was being advocated both in the Senate and\r\nout of it.  I instanced several very distinguished gentlemen\r\nindeed, one a man of very high authority in the Senate in\r\nmatters relating to foreign affairs, who were urging publicly\r\nand privately the Hawaiian Treaty on the ground that we must\r\nhave Hawaii in order to help us get our share of China.  President\r\nMcKinley disclaimed any such purpose.  He expressed his earnest\r\nand emphatic dissent from the opinions imputed to several\r\nleading Republicans, whom he named.\r\n\r\nI never, at any time during the discussion of the Philippine\r\nquestion, expressed a more emphatic disapproval of the acquisition\r\nof dependencies or Oriental Empire by military strength, than\r\nhe expressed on that occasion.  I am justified in putting\r\nthis on record, not only because I am confirmed by several\r\ngentlemen in public life, who had interviews with him, but\r\nbecause he made in substance the same declaration in public.\r\n\r\nHe declared, speaking of this very matter of acquiring sovereignty\r\nover Spanish territory by conquest:\r\n\r\n\"Forcible annexation, according to our American code of morals,\r\nwould be criminal aggression.\"\r\n\r\nHe said at another time:\r\n\r\n\"Human rights and constitutional privileges must not be forgotten\r\nin the race for wealth and commercial supremacy.  The Government\r\nof the people must be by the people and not by a few of the\r\npeople.  It must rest upon the free consent of the governed\r\nand all of the governed.  Power, it must be remembered, which\r\nis secured by oppression or usurpation or by any form of injustice\r\nis soon dethroned.  We have no right in law or morals to usurp\r\nthat which belongs to another, whether it is property or power.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose he was then speaking of our duty as to any people\r\nwhom we might liberate from Spain, as the results of the Spanish\r\nWar.  He unquestionably meant that we had no right, in law\r\nor morals, to usurp the right of self-government which belonged\r\nto the Cubans, or to the Philippine people.\r\n\r\nYet I have no doubt whatever that in the attitude that he\r\ntook later he was actuated by a serious and lofty purpose\r\nto do right.  I think he was led on from one step to another\r\nby what he deemed the necessity of the present occasion.  I\r\ndare say that he was influenced, as any other man who was\r\nnot more than human would have been influenced, by the apparently\r\nearnest desire of the American people, as he understood it,\r\nas it was conveyed to him on his Western journey.  But I believe\r\nevery step he took he thought necessary at the time.  I further\r\nbelieve, although I may not be able to convince other men,\r\nand no man will know until the secret history of that time\r\nshall be made known, that if he had lived, before his Administration\r\nwas over, he would have placed the Republic again on the principles\r\nfrom which it seems to me we departed--the great doctrine\r\nof Jefferson, the great doctrine of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nthat there can be no just Government by one people over another\r\nwithout its consent, and that the International law declared\r\nby the Republic is that all Governments must depend for their\r\njust powers upon the consent of the governed.  This was insisted\r\non by our Fathers as the doctrine of International law, to\r\nbe acted upon by the infant Republic for itself.  In this\r\nI am confirmed by the testimony of Mr. Secretary Long, who\r\nwas in President McKinley's most intimate counsels.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty negotiated by President McKinley with Hawaii was\r\nnot acted upon.  It was concluded to substitute a joint resolution,\r\nfor which there was a precedent in the case of the acquisition\r\nof Texas.  I voted for the joint resolution, as did Senator\r\nHale of Maine, and several Democratic Senators, who were earnestly\r\nopposed to what is known as the policy of Imperialism.\r\n\r\nI left the President, after the conversation above related,\r\nwithout giving him any assurance as to my action.  But I\r\ndetermined on full reflection, to support the acquisition of\r\nHawaii, in accordance with my long-settled purpose, and at\r\nthe same time to make a clear and emphatic statement of my\r\nunalterable opposition to acquiring dependencies in the East,\r\nif we did not expect, when the proper time came, to admit\r\nthem to the Union as States.  This I did to the best of my\r\npower.  I was invited to give an address before a college\r\nin Pennsylvania, where I took occasion to make an emphatic\r\ndeclaration of the doctrine on which I meant to act.\r\n\r\nAfterward, July 5, 1898, I made a speech in the Senate, on\r\nthe joint resolution for the acquisition of Hawaii, in which\r\nI said that I had entertained grave doubts in regard to that\r\nmeasure; that I had approached the subject with greater hesitation\r\nand anxiety than I had ever felt in regard to any other matter\r\nduring the whole of my public life.\r\n\r\nI went on to say:\r\n\r\n\"The trouble I have found with the Hawaiian business is this:\r\nNot in the character of the population of the Sandwich Island,\r\nnot in their distance from our shores, not in the doubt that\r\nwe have an honest right to deal with the existing government\r\nthere in such a matter.  I have found my trouble in the nature\r\nand character of the argument by which, in the beginning and\r\never since, a great many friends of annexation have sought\r\nto support it . . . .\r\n\r\n\"If this be the first step in the acquisition of dominion\r\nover barbarous archipelagoes in distant seas; if we are to\r\nenter into competition with the great powers of Europe in\r\nthe plundering of China, in the division of Africa; if we\r\nare to quit our own to stand on foreign lands; if our commerce\r\nis hereafter to be forced upon unwilling peoples at the cannon's\r\nmouth; if we are ourselves to be governed in part by peoples\r\nto whom the Declaration of Independence is a stranger; or,\r\nworse still, if we are to govern subjects and vassal States,\r\ntrampling as we do it on our own great Charter which recognizes\r\nalike the liberty and the dignity of individual manhood, then\r\nlet us resist this thing in the beginning, and let us resist\r\nit to the death.\r\n\r\n\"I do not agree with those gentlemen who think we would wrest\r\nthe Philippine Islands from Spain and take charge of them\r\nourselves.  I do not think we should acquire Cuba, as the\r\nresult of the existing war, to be annexed to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nI reinforced this protest as well I could.  But I went on\r\nto state the reasons which had actuated me in favoring the\r\nmeasure, and that my unconquerable repugnance to the acquisition\r\nof territory to be held in dependency did not apply to that\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI cited the Teller resolution, and declared that it bound\r\nthe American people in honor, and that its principle applied\r\nto all Spanish territory.  I maintained that there was nothing\r\nin the acquisition of Hawaii inconsistent with this doctrine.\r\nI think so still.\r\n\r\nI was bitterly reproached by some worthy persons, who I suppose\r\nwill always find matter for bitter reproach in everything\r\nsaid or done on public matters.  They charged me with speaking\r\none way and voting another.  But I am content to leave the\r\ncase on its merits, and on the record.\r\n\r\nThe war went on.  The feeling of the country was deeply excited.\r\nPresident McKinley made his famous Western journey.  He was\r\ngreeted by enthusiastic throngs.  The feeling in that part\r\nof the country in favor of a permanent dominion over the Philippine\r\nIslands was uttered by excited crowds, whom he addressed from\r\nthe platform and the railroad cars as he passed thorough the\r\ncountry.  But the sober, conservative feeling, which seldom\r\nfinds utterance in such assemblies, did not make itself heard.\r\n\r\nThe President returned to Washington, undoubtedly in the honest\r\nbelief that the country demanded that he acquire the Philippine\r\nIslands, and that Congress should govern them.\r\n\r\nI have never attributed publicly, or in my own heart, to\r\nPresident McKinley any but the most conscientious desire\r\nto do his duty in what, as the case seems to me, was an entire\r\nchange of purpose.  Many military and naval officers, from\r\nwhose reports he had to get his facts almost wholly, insisted\r\nthat the Philippine people were unfit for self-government.\r\nAfter the unhappy conflict of arms the solution of the problem\r\nseemed to be to compel the Philippine people to unconditional\r\nsubmission.  It would not be just or fair that I should undertake\r\nto state the reasons which controlled the President in adopting\r\nthe conclusions to which I did not myself agree.  I am merely\r\ntelling my own part in the transaction.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to Washington, at the beginning of the session\r\nin December, 1898, I had occasion to see the President almost\r\nimmediately.  His purpose was to make a Treaty by which, without\r\nthe assent of their inhabitants, we should acquire the Philippine\r\nIslands.  We were to hold and govern in subjection the people\r\nof the Philippine Islands.  That was pretty well understood.\r\n\r\nThe national power of Spain was destroyed.  It was clear\r\nthat she must submit to whatever terms we should impose.\r\nThe President had chosen, as Commissioners to negotiate the\r\nTreaty, five gentlemen, three of whom, Senators Cushman K.\r\nDavis, and William P. Frye and Whitelaw Reid, the accomplished\r\neditor of the New York _Tribune,_ former Minister to France,\r\nwere well known to be zealous for acquiring territory in the\r\nEast.  Mr. Frye was said to have declared in a speech not\r\nlong before he went abroad that he was in favor of keeping\r\neverything we could lay our hands on.  I suppose that was,\r\nhowever, intended as a bit of jocose extravagance, which that\r\nmost excellent gentleman did not mean to have taken too seriously.\r\n\r\nMr. Day, the Secretary of State, and Senator Gray of Delaware,\r\nwere understood to be utterly opposed to the policy of expansion\r\nor Imperialism.\r\n\r\nI do not know about Mr. Day.  But it appeared, when three\r\nyears afterward the correspondence between the Commissioners\r\nand the Department of State became public, that Mr. Day expressed\r\nno objection to the acquisition of Luzon, but objected to\r\na peremptory demand for the whole Philippine Island group,\r\nthereby--to use his language--\"leaving us open to the imputation\r\nof following agreement to negotiate with demand for whole\r\nsubject matter of discussion ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe public impression as to Senator Gray is confirmed by the\r\nfollowing remonstrance, which appears in the same correspondence:\r\n\r\nPEACE COMMISSIONERS TO MR. HAY\r\n[Telegram]\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 25, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned cannot agree that it is wise to take Philippine\r\nIslands in whole or in part.  To do so would be to reverse\r\naccepted continental policy of the country, declared and acted\r\nupon throughout our history.  Propinquity governs the case\r\nof Cuba and Porto Rico.  Policy proposed introduces us into\r\nEuropean politics and the entangling alliances against which\r\nWashington and all American statemen have protested.  It will\r\nmake necessary a navy equal to largest of powers; a greatly\r\nincreased military establishment; immense sums for fortifications\r\nand harbors; multiply occasions for dangerous complications\r\nwith foreign nations, and increase burdens of taxation.  Will\r\nreceive in compensation no outlet for American labor in labor\r\nmarket already overcrowded and cheap; no area for homes for\r\nAmerican citizens; climate and social conditions demoralizing\r\nto character of American youth; new and disturbing questions\r\nintroduced into our politics; church question menacing.   On\r\nwhole, instead of indemnity--injury.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned cannot agree that any obligation incurred\r\nto insurgents is paramount to our own manifest interests.\r\nAttacked Manila as part of legitimate war against Spain.\r\nIf we had captured Cadiz and Carlists had helped us, would\r\nnot owe duty to stay by them at the conclusion of war.  On\r\nthe contrary, interests and duty would require us to abandon\r\nboth Manila and Cadiz.  No place for colonial administration\r\nor government of subject people in American system.  So much\r\nfrom standpoint of interest; but even conceding all benefits\r\nclaimed for annexation, we thereby abandon the infinitely\r\ngreater benefit to accrue from acting the part of a great,\r\npowerful, and Christian nation; we exchange the moral grandeur\r\nand strength to be gained by keeping our word to nations of\r\nthe world and by exhibiting a magnanimity and moderation in\r\nthe hour of victory that becomes the advanced civilization\r\nwe claim, for doubtful material advantages and shameful stepping\r\ndown from high moral position boastfully assumed.  We should\r\nset example in these respects, not follow in the selfish and\r\nvulgar greed for territory which Europe has inherited from\r\nmediaeval times.  Our declaration of war upon Spain was accompanied\r\nby a solemn and deliberate definition of our purpose.  Now\r\nthat we have achieved all and more than our object, let us\r\nsimply keep our word.  Third article of the protocol leaves\r\neverything concerning the control of the Philippine Islands\r\nto negotiation between the parties.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd now to say that we will not negotiate but will\r\nappropriate the whole subject-matter of negotiation.  At\r\nthe very least let us adhere to the President' instructions\r\nand if conditions require the keeping of Luzon forego the\r\nmaterial advantages claimed in annexing other islands.  Above\r\nall let us not make a mockery of the injunction contained\r\nin those instructions, where, after stating that we took\r\nup arms only in obedience to the dictates of humanity and\r\nin the fulfillment of high public and moral obligations, and\r\nthat we had no design of aggrandizement and no ambition of\r\nconquest, the President among other things eloquently says:\r\n\r\n\"It is my earnest wish that the United States in making peace\r\nshould follow the same high rule of conduct which guided it\r\nin facing war.  It should be as scrupulous and magnanimous\r\nin the concluding settlement as it was just and humane in\r\nits original action.\"\r\n\r\nThis and more, of which I earnestly ask a reperusal, binds\r\nmy conscience and governs my action.\r\n\r\nGEORGE GRAY.\r\n  WEDNESDAY, 12.30, night.\r\n\r\nSenator Gray afterward signed the Treaty, defended it in\r\ndebate, and voted for its ratification.  He vigorously defended\r\nhis vote on the floor of the Senate, chiefly by the argument\r\nthat when he learned that it was the purpose of the United\r\nStates to expel Spain from the Philippine Islands, he concluded\r\nit was our duty to remain there for the protection of the\r\npeople against foreign rapacity and against domestic anarchy.\r\nHe claimed that he had been influenced in coming to this conclusion\r\nvery considerably by the fact that I was reported to have\r\nsaid that under no circumstances would we give back the Philippine\r\npeople to Spain.  That was true.  I believed then, and believe\r\nnow, that it was our duty to deliver them from Spain, to protect\r\nthem against her, or against the cupidity of any other nation\r\nuntil her people could have tried fully the experiment of self-\r\ngovernment, in which I have little doubt they would have\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw President McKinley early in December, 1898, he\r\nwas, I suppose, committed to the policy to which he adhered.\r\nHe greeted me with the delightful and affectionate cordiality\r\nwhich I always found in him.  He took me by the hand, and\r\nsaid:  \"How are you feeling this winter, Mr. Senator?\" I\r\nwas determined there should be no misunderstanding.  I replied\r\nat once:  \"Pretty pugnacious, I confess, Mr. President.\"\r\nThe tears came into his eyes, and he said, grasping my hand\r\nagain:  \"I shall always love you, whatever you do.\"\r\n\r\nI found we differed widely on this great subject.  I denounced\r\nwith all the vigor of which I was capable the Treaty, and\r\nthe conduct of the war in the Philippine Islands, in the Senate,\r\non the platform, in many public letters, and in articles in\r\nmagazines and newspapers.  But President McKinley never abated\r\none jot of his cordiality toward me.  I did not, of course,\r\nundertake to press upon him my advice in matters affecting\r\nthe Philippine Islands, about which we differed so much.  But\r\nhe continued to seek it, and to take it in all other matters\r\nas constantly as ever before.\r\n\r\nIn order that it may not be supposed that I deceived myself\r\nin regard to President McKinley's kindly regard, I may perhaps\r\nbe pardoned for saying that his close friend, Senator Hanna,\r\nhas more than once assured me that McKinley's love for me\r\nwas never abated, and for citing a sentence from an article\r\nby Charles Emory Smith, his trusted counsellor and able and\r\naccomplished Postmaster-General, in this Cabinet.  Mr. Smith\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Senator Hoar was the earnest foe and critic of President\r\nMcKinley's policy.  But President McKinley had the warmest\r\nregard and consideration for him.  Nothing, indeed, in public\r\nlife was sweeter than the sentiment of these different and\r\ndiffering men toward each other.  President McKinley was anxious\r\nto commission Senator Hoar as Minister to England, and proffered\r\nhim the place.  It was without any desire to remove him from\r\nthe arena of contention--apprehension of such a reflection\r\nrestrained the proffer for a time--though the contention had\r\nnot then been fully developed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter President McKinley's death I expressed the public sorrow\r\nand my own in an address to a vast audience of the people\r\nof my own city of Worcester, in Mechanics' Hall; and again,\r\nat the request of the Republican State Committee, at the Republican\r\nState Convention shortly afterward.\r\n\r\nI have reason to know that both the addresses gave pleasure\r\nto many of the lamented President's closest and warmest friends\r\nthroughout the country.  I was afterward invited by the City\r\nGovernment of Worcester to deliver a historical eulogy on\r\nPresident McKinley before them.  That office, it seemed to\r\nme, I ought to decline.  It was not because I was behind any\r\nother man in admiration or personal affection for that lofty\r\nand beautiful character.  But I thought that address, which\r\nwas not only to utter the voice of public sorrow, but to give\r\na careful and discriminating sketch of the public life of\r\nits subject, ought to be delivered by some person who agreed\r\nwith him in regard to the most important action of his life.\r\nI could not well pass over the Philippine question.  I could\r\nnot well speak of it without stating my own opinion.  I could\r\nnot undertake to state President McKinley's opinion, conduct\r\nor policy, without expressing my disapproval of it, and if\r\nI did not do that, I could not state it without being thought\r\nby those who heartily approved it, not to have stated it justly\r\nand fairly.\r\n\r\nI had repeatedly declared, during the preceding two years,\r\nboth before and since his death, my highest admiration for\r\nthe intellectual and moral qualities of my beloved friend,\r\nand my belief that he would have a very high place in history\r\namong the best and ablest men of the country.\r\n\r\nBut I thought the story of the important part of his life\r\nshould be told from his point of view, and not from mine;\r\nthat the reasons which governed him should be stated by a\r\nperson sure to appreciate them fully.  If a great Catholic\r\nPrelate were to die, his eulogy should not be pronounced\r\nby a Protestant.  When Dr. Channing died, we did not select\r\na Calvinist minister to pronounce his funeral sermon.  When\r\nCharles Sumner died Mr. Schurz and Mr. Curtis, not some old\r\nWhig, and not some earnest supporter of General Grant, pronounced\r\nthe eulogy.  I suppose nobody would have dreamed of asking\r\na Free Trader to pronounce the eulogy on President McKinley\r\nif he had died soon after the beginning of his first term.\r\nSo I declined the office.  The City did not ask anybody else\r\nto fill my place, or perform the task.\r\n\r\nI will not now renew the debate about our treatment of the\r\npeople of the Philippine Islands.  My opinion has not at all\r\nchanged.  I think that under the lead of Mabini and Aguinaldo\r\nand their associates, but for our interference, a Republic\r\nwould have been established in Luzon, which would have compared\r\nwell with the best of the Republican Governments between the\r\nUnited States and Cape Horn.  For years and for generations,\r\nand perhaps for centuries, there would have been turbulence,\r\ndisorder and revolution.  But in her own way Destiny would\r\nhave evolved for them a force of civic rule best adapted to\r\ntheir need.  If we had treated them as we did Cuba, we should\r\nhave been saved the public shame of violating not only our\r\nown pledges, but the rule of conduct which we had declared\r\nto be self-evident truth in the beginning of our history.\r\nWe should have been saved the humiliation of witnessing the\r\nsubjection by Great Britain of the Boers in South Africa,\r\nwithout a murmur of disapproval, and without an expression\r\nof one word of sympathy for the heroic victims.\r\n\r\nMy term as Senator expired on the fourth of March, 1901.\r\nThe election of Senator for the following term came in January\r\nof that year.  I differed sharply from my colleague, Mr. Lodge,\r\nin this whole matter.  But the people of Massachusetts, with\r\nthe generous and liberal temper which ever distinguished that\r\nnoble Commonwealth, desired that their Senators should act\r\nupon their own judgment, without any constraint.\r\n\r\nA resolution was introduced at the session of the Legislature\r\nof 1899 by Mr. Mellen, Democratic member from Worcester, thanking\r\nme for my speech in opposition to the Spanish Treaty, endorsing\r\nthe doctrine of that speech, and condemning the subjugation\r\nof the Philippine people by force of arms.\r\n\r\nCharles G. Washburn, Republican member from Worcester, introduced\r\na resolution commending my speech, and declaring it to be\r\n\"A speech of the loftiest patriotism and eloquent interpretation\r\nof the high conception of human freedom which the fathers\r\nsought to preserve for all time in the Declaration of Independence\r\nand in the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolution, if adopted, would, by implication, condemn\r\nthe well-known opinion and action of my colleague.  They were\r\nencountered by several others, none of which referred to either\r\nSenator, but expressed approval of the Spanish Treaty.  One\r\nof them, however, presented in the House by Mr. Mills of\r\nNewburyport, declared that the Treaty ought to be ratified,\r\nand then the United States should fulfil to Porto Rico and\r\nthe Philippine Islands the pledge of self-government and independence\r\nmade to Cuba.  Very wisely all these resolutions were referred\r\nto the Committee on Federal Relations, who reported this as\r\na compromise:\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION REPORTED BY THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL\r\n  RELATIONS, OF THE LEGISLATURE, MARCH 29, 1899\r\n\r\n_Resolved,_ by the Senate and House of Representatives of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts in General Court assembled,\r\nthat Massachusetts, ever loyal in sympathy and support of\r\nthe General Government, continues her unabated confidence\r\nin her Senators, and with a just pride in the eloquent and\r\nmemorable words they have uttered, leaves them untrammeled\r\nin the exercise of an independent and patriotic judgment upon\r\nthe momentous questions presented for their consideration.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter was then dropped.  But the Legislature,\r\nand the generous people of Massachusetts whom they represented,\r\nacted upon the spirit of the Committee's Resolution.  I was\r\nreelected without opposition.  I had every Republican vote,\r\nand many Democratic votes, of the Legislature.  My affectionate\r\nand cordial relations with my brilliant and accomplished colleague\r\nhave never suffered an instant's interruption.\r\n\r\nI think I am entitled to record, however, that this result\r\nwas not accomplished by any abatement of my opposition to\r\nthe policy of the Administration as to the Philippine Islands.\r\nI made a great many speeches within a few weeks of the Presidential\r\nelection in 1900.  The members of the Senate and House, of\r\nthe Massachusetts Legislature, who were to choose a Senator,\r\nwere to be chosen at the same time.  I expressed my unchanged\r\nand earnest opposition of disapproval to the whole business\r\nat length.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the habit of appealing to the love of the\r\nflag in behalf of this policy of conquest, I said that there\r\nwas but one symbol more sacred than the American flag.  That\r\nwas the bread and wine which represented the body and blood\r\nof the Saviour of mankind; adding, that a man who would use\r\nan appeal to the flag in aid of the subjugation of an unwilling\r\npeople, would be capable of using the sacramental wine for\r\na debauch.\r\n\r\nThe week before the election of Senator came on a bill for\r\nthe reorganization of the Army was before the Senate.  That\r\ncontained a provision for increasing the Army to a hundred\r\nthousand men, allowing the President, however, to reduce it\r\nto seventy thousand, and to raise it again if necessary,\r\nso it would in his discretion be elastic, within those limitations.\r\n\r\nMr. Bacon, of Georgia, who seemed to be the leader of the\r\nDemocrats on that measure, inquired of the Republicans who\r\nwere managing the bill, how many men they needed and what\r\ntime would be required to put down the insurrection in the\r\nPhilippine Islands.  Senator Bacon said that they would give\r\nthem the hundred thousand men, or any force they might demand\r\nfor one or two or three or five years, or for any required\r\ntime.  But they were unwilling to give the President the power\r\nof expanding and contracting the army in time of peace.  This\r\nwas in full Senate.\r\n\r\nI followed with a statement that I had no objection to giving\r\nthe President this discretion, and did not disapprove the\r\nbill on that account.  I thought the size of the Army in\r\ntime of peace should be left largely to the opinion of the\r\nexperts, especially General Miles, the famous soldier at the\r\nhead of our Army, who thought the regular Army should consist\r\nof one hundred for every thousand of our population.  That\r\nwould be about eighty thousand then, and before long would\r\nrequire a hundred thousand men.  But I said I was opposed\r\nto raising soldiers to carry on the war in the Philippine\r\nIslands.  The only way to stop it that I knew was to refuse\r\nto vote for the Army Bill.  I voted against it solely on that\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nI meant that if the Legislature of Massachusetts were to\r\nreelect me, no man should ever have it to say that I had\r\nbought my reelection by silence on this question, or concealed\r\nmy opinion, however extreme it might be, until after election.\r\n\r\nAfter my election I delivered an address before the two Houses\r\nof the Legislature, at their request, and was received with\r\na most cordial enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nYet I think that if any leading Republican who had differed\r\nfrom me on this question, especially Governor Long, of whose\r\nbrilliant administration of the Navy the people of the Commonwealth\r\nwere so proud, had pressed his candidacy for the office in\r\nopposition to me, as has been the custom in like cases in\r\nother States, it is not unlikely that he would have been elected.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt I should have found Governor Roger Wolcott\r\na formidable competitor, if he had lived and been willing.\r\nGovernor Wolcott had made a statement in public, quietly and\r\nbriefly, as was his wont, expressing his sympathy with me\r\nwhen the question of the Treaty was under debate.  Somewhat\r\nlater he made a statement in the same way, expressing his\r\nopinion that the Administration should be supported.  Both\r\nthese declarations were in general terms.  They were not inconsistent\r\nwith each other.  But death arrested the honorable and useful\r\ncareer of Roger Wolcott when he was still in the prime of\r\nlife, in the strength of his noble manhood, a strength which\r\nseemed rapidly enlarging and growing as if in early youth.\r\n\r\nI have not doubt that the subjugation of the Philippine Islands,\r\nthe acquisition of a dependency to be held in subjection by\r\nthe United States, the overthrow of the great doctrine that\r\nGovernments rest on the consent of the governed; that all\r\nthe painful consequences which have attended the war for the\r\nsubjugation of that distant people, would have been avoided\r\nif the Democratic opposition had been hearty and sincere.\r\nThe same spirit that defeated the Election bill in spite of\r\nthe majority in its favor, would have easily accomplished\r\nthat result.  The Democratic Party, as a party, never meant\r\nbusiness in this matter.  I do not deny that many Democrats--\r\nI dare say a majority of the Democrats--were as earnestly\r\nand seriously opposed to the acquisition of the Philippine\r\nIslands as I was myself.  But they never wielded their party\r\nstrength in opposition to it.  I said to one eminent Democratic\r\nleader early in the year 1900: \"There is one way in which\r\nyou can put an end to this whole business.  If you can elect\r\na Democratic House it will have power under the Constitution\r\nto determine the use to which the Army shall be put.  In that\r\nway you compelled President Hayes to refrain from further\r\nsupport by military force of the Republican State Governments\r\nin the South.\" He answered: \"Mr. Hoar, we shall never do\r\nanything as radical as that.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Senator Bacon made the offer to the majority of the Senate\r\nto agree to give them all the military power they desired\r\nfor the suppression of the resistance in the Philippines\r\nfor as long a time as they should think it necessary, the\r\nentire Democratic Party in the Senate was in their seats,\r\nand there was no expression of dissent.\r\n\r\nI think the Democratic Party feared the fate of the Federalists\r\nwho opposed the War of 1812, and of the Democrats who opposed\r\nthe War for the Union in 1861.  This of course in the nature\r\nof things is but conjecture.\r\n\r\nSeventeen of the followers of Mr. Bryan voted for the Treaty.\r\nThe Treaty would have been defeated, not only lacking the\r\nneedful two thirds, but by a majority of the Senate but for\r\nthe votes of Democrats and Populists.\r\n\r\nSenators Morgan and Pettus of Alabama, Senator McLaurin of\r\nSouth Carolina, Senator McEnery of Louisiana, were avowed\r\nsupporters of the Treaty from the beginning.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan in the height of the contest came to Washington\r\nfor the express purpose of urging upon his followers that\r\nit was best to support the Treaty, end the War, and let the\r\nquestion of what should be done with our conquest be settled\r\nin the coming campaign.  He urged upon them, as I was told\r\nby several Democrats at the time who did not take his advice,\r\nthat the Democratic Party could not hope to win a victory\r\non the financial questions at stake after they had been beaten\r\non them in a time of adversity; and that they must have this\r\nissue for the coming campaign.  He was besought by his wiser\r\npolitical associates to go away and leave the Senate to settle\r\nthe matter.  But he remained.\r\n\r\nAfter that it became impossible, not only to defeat the Treaty,\r\nbut to defeat the policy which had inspired it.  The Treaty\r\npledged that the Philippine Islands should be governed by\r\nCongress.  It undertook obligations which require for their\r\nfulfillment, at least ten years' control of the Islands.\r\nIt put the people of the Philippine Islands in the attitude\r\nof abandoning the Republic they had formed, and of acknowledging\r\nnot only our supremacy but that they were neither entitled\r\nor fit to govern themselves or to carry on the war which had\r\nunfortunately broken out.  I do not mean to imply that, as\r\nI have said, a large number of the Democratic Party both in\r\npublic life and out of it, were not sincere and zealous in\r\ntheir opposition to this wretched business.  But next to a\r\nvery few men who controlled the policy of the Republican Party\r\nin this matter, Mr. Bryan and his followers who voted in the\r\nSenate for the Treaty are responsible for the results.\r\n\r\nI have been blamed, as I have said already, because, with\r\nmy opinions, I did not join the Democratic Party and help\r\nto elect Mr. Bryan.  I disagreed with him and his party as\r\nto every other issue then pending before the American people.\r\nSo differing from him, I found nothing in his attitude or\r\nthat of his party, to induce me to support him, or even to\r\ninspire my confidence in their settlement of the question of\r\nImperialism or expansion.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if he had been elected, he would have accepted\r\nthe result, have put the blame for it on his predecessor\r\nin office, and matters would have gone on very much as they\r\nhave under Republican control.\r\n\r\nI have been told by many Senators who voted for the Treaty,\r\nthat they regretted that vote more than any other act of their\r\nlives.  Enough Senators have said this to me in person, not\r\nonly to have defeated the Treaty, but if they had so voted,\r\nto have defeated it by a majority.  A very eminent Republican\r\nSenator told me that more than twenty Senators, who voted\r\nfor the Treaty, had given the same assurance to him.  But\r\nthey are very unwilling to make the declaration public.  Several\r\ngentlemen, however, have publicly expressed their regret for\r\ntheir vote, as is well known, enough to have changed the result.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of my party, whose glory and whose service to\r\nLiberty are the pride of my life, crushing out this people\r\nin their effort to establish a Republic, and hear people\r\ntalk about _giving_ them good Government, and that they are\r\nbetter off than they ever were under Spain, I feel very much\r\nas if I had learned that my father, or some other honored\r\nancestor, had been a slave-trader in his time, and had boasted\r\nthat he had introduced a new and easier kind of hand-cuffs\r\nor fetters to be worn by the slaves during the horrors of\r\nthe middle passage.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that there is a respectable or intelligent\r\nFilipino to-day, unless possibly some Macabebe scout, who\r\nwould not get rid of the Government of the United States\r\nat once, if he could.  Buencamino is said to be one of the\r\nablest of their public men.  He has been quoted as friendly\r\nto us, and is so.  There is no doubt that he has so expressed\r\nhimself.  He has been appointed a member of the Taft Government,\r\nand has had committed to him the responsible and important\r\nduty of deciding the appointments to the offices which are\r\nto be filled by the native Filipinos, under the existing establishment.\r\nIt is said by both sides that he is crafty and selfish and\r\nambitious, and that he likes to be on the side that is the\r\nstrongest.  How that may be, I do not know.  But he will not\r\neven pretend to accept the rule of the United States willingly.\r\nHe appeared as a witness before a Committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, when in this country in 1902.  He was asked\r\nwhether his people approved the policy of the Democratic Party.\r\nHe answered emphatically: \"No.  They do not wish to have the\r\nUnited States abandon them to the ambition or cupidity of\r\nforeign Governments.\" But he added: \"Every Filipino is in\r\nfavor of the policy advocated by Senator Hoar.\" \"What!\" said\r\nhis inquirer, with great surprise, \"Do you mean to say that\r\nevery Filipino agrees with Senator Hoar in his views?\" \"Yes,\"\r\nreplied the man, with great emphasis; \"every Filipino agrees\r\nwith Senator Hoar.\"\r\n\r\nI mentioned this one day in conversation with President Roosevelt.\r\nHe told me that Buencamino had said exactly the same thing\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miles told me on his return from his journey round\r\nthe world that he saw many leaders of the Philippine people;\r\nthat they spoke of me with great regard and attachment.\r\n\r\nJune 17, 1902, an eminent Hindoo scholar, published a long\r\narticle in the _Japan Times,_ in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"The speech of Mr. Hoar, though an address to his own countrymen,\r\nis a message of hope to the whole world which sank with despondency\r\nat the sight of Republican America behaving like a cruel,\r\ntyrannical and rapacious Empire in the Philippines and particularly\r\nto the broken-hearted people of Asia who are beginning to\r\nlose all confidence in the humanity of the white races.  Or\r\nis it that they have lost it already?  Hence all papers in\r\nAsia should reprint his speech, translate it, and distribute\r\nit broadcast.  Let it be brought home to the Asiatic people\r\nso that they may work and worship their champion and his forefathers.\r\nThanks to the awakening in America, thanks to the forces that\r\nare at work to chase out the degenerating, demoralizing passion\r\nfor territorial aggrandizement from the noble American mind\r\nand save it for itself and the world at large from the cancer\r\nof Imperialism.\"\r\n\r\nI am afraid I am committing an offence against good taste\r\nin repeating such laudations.  But it must be remembered\r\nthat a public man who has to encounter so much bitter reviling\r\nand objurgation, is fairly entitled to have a little extravagance\r\non the other side that the balance may be even.  I would rather\r\nhave the gratitude of the poor people of the Philippine Islands,\r\namid their sorrow, and have it true that what I may say or\r\ndo has brought a ray of hope into the gloomy caverns in which\r\nthe oppressed peoples of Asia dwell, than to receive a Ducal\r\nCoronet from every Monarch in Europe, or command the applause\r\nof listening Senators and read my history in a Nation's eyes.\r\n\r\nAt first there can seem nothing more absurd than the suggestion\r\nof my Asiatic friend that the people of Asia should worship\r\ntheir champion and his ancestors.  But on second thought,\r\nit is fair to say that while no human being can be entitled\r\nto be worshipped by any other, yet that we got our love of\r\nLiberty from our ancestors, or at any rate that is where I\r\ngot mine, and that they are entitled to all the credit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\nAPPOINTMENTS TO OFFICE\r\n\r\nAmong the great satisfactions in the life of public men is\r\nthat of sometimes being instrumental in the advancement to\r\nplaces of public honor of worthy men, and of being able to\r\nhave a great and salutary influence upon their lives.  I have\r\nalways held to the doctrine of what is called Civil Service\r\nReform, and have maintained to the best of my ability the\r\ndoctrine of the absolute independence of the Executive in\r\nsuch matters, as his right to disregard the wishes and opinions\r\nof members of either House of Congress, and to make his appointments,\r\nexecutive and judicial, without advice, or on such advice\r\nas he shall think best.  But, at the same time, there can\r\nbe no doubt that the Executive must depend on some advice\r\nother than his own, to learn the quality of men in different\r\nparts of this vast Republic, and to learn what will be agreeable\r\nto public opinion and to the party which is administering\r\nthe Government and is responsible for its administration.\r\nHe will, ordinarily, find no better source of such information\r\nthan in the men whom the people have shown their own confidence\r\nby entrusting them with the important function of Senator\r\nor Representative.  He will soon learn to know his men, and\r\nhow far he can safely take such advice.  He must be careful\r\nto see to it that he is not induced to build up a faction\r\nin his party, or to fill up the public offices with the partisans\r\nof ambitious but unscrupulous politicians.  When I entered\r\nthe House of Representatives, before the Civil Service Reform\r\nhad made any progress, I addressed and had put on file with\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury a letter in which I said that\r\nI desired him to understand when I made a recommendation to\r\nhim of any person for public office, it was to be taken merely\r\nas my opinion of the merit of the candidate, and not as an\r\nexpression of a personal request; and that if he found any\r\nother person who would in his judgment be better for the public\r\nservice, I hoped he would make the selection without regard\r\nto my recommendation.\r\n\r\nI have never undertaken to use public office as personal\r\npatronage, or to claim the right to dictate to the President\r\nof the United States, or that the executive was not entirely\r\nfree, upon such advice as he saw fit, or without advice, if he\r\nthought fit, in making his selection for public office.\r\n\r\nIt has been my good fortune to have influenced, or I think\r\nI may fairly say, procured the appointment to public office\r\nof many gentlemen who would not have been appointed without\r\nmy active efforts.  I have no reason to be ashamed of one\r\nof the list.  I believe that the following gentlemen, beside\r\nothers less distinguished, who have been very satisfactory,\r\nable and faithful public servants, owe their appointment to\r\nmy original suggestion, or would not have been appointed without\r\nmy earnest efforts.\r\n\r\nCharles Devens, Attorney-General; Alanson W. Beard, Collector\r\nof the Port of Boston; Horace Gray, first to the office of\r\nReporter of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and later\r\nto that of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates; J. Evarts Greene, Postmaster of Worcester; Thomas\r\nL. Nelson, Judge of the District Court of Massachusetts; Francis\r\nC. Lowell, Judge of the District Court of Massachusetts; Howell\r\nE. Jackson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States; John D. Washburn, Minister to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nI think I may also fairly claim that the election of William\r\nB. Washburn as Governor of Massachusetts was due not only\r\nto the fact that I originally proposed him as a candidate,\r\nbut to my active efforts in the campaign which preceded the\r\nConvention which nominated him.\r\n\r\nThere is no man in this list of greater ability or of higher\r\nquality of manhood than Evarts Greene.  Mr. Greene was compelled\r\nby the illness of his wife to remain fast-bound in one spot,\r\ninstead of going to some large city where his great talent\r\nwould have commanded a very high place indeed in his profession\r\nas editor.  When he edited the Worcester _Spy,_ it was one\r\nof the most influential Republican newspapers in the country.\r\nThe _Spy_ got into pecuniary difficulties.  Mr. Greene, with\r\nsome reluctance, accepted the office of Postmaster, an office\r\nwhich, according to usage in such cases, was in my gift.\r\n\r\nJust before Postmaster-General Wanamaker, whose executive\r\nability no man will question, went out of office, he requested\r\nMr. Greene to send to the Department an account of the improvements\r\nhe had made and proposed in the post-office service.  This\r\nwas sent in a circular all over the country to other like\r\npost-offices.\r\n\r\nJust before Mr. Greene died, President Roosevelt visited\r\nWorcester.  In passing the post-office, where the persons\r\nemployed in the service were collected, he stopped and said\r\nhe was glad to see \"what we have been accustomed to consider\r\nthe record post-office.\"  This, as may well be believed,\r\ngave Mr. Greene great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\nORATORY AND SOME ORATORS I HAVE HEARD\r\n\r\nThe longer I live, the more highly I have come to value the\r\ngift of eloquence.  Indeed, I am not sure that it is not\r\nthe single gift most to be coveted by man.  It is hard, perhaps\r\nimpossible, to define, as poetry is impossible to define.\r\nTo be a perfect and consummate orator is to possess the highest\r\nfaculty given to man.  He must be a great artist, and more.\r\nHe must be a great actor, and more.  He must be a master of\r\nthe great things that interest mankind.  What he says ought\r\nto have as permanent a place in literature as the highest\r\npoetry.  He must be able to play at will on the mighty organ,\r\nhis audience, of which human souls are the keys.  He must\r\nhave knowledge, wit, wisdom, fancy, imagination, courage,\r\nnobleness, sincerity, grace, a heart of fire.  He must himself\r\nrespond to every emotion as an AEolian harp to the breeze.\r\nHe must have\r\n\r\n  An eye that tears can on a sudden fill\r\n  And lips that smile before the tears are gone.\r\n\r\nHe must have a noble personal presence.  He must have, in\r\nperfection, the eye and the voice which are the only and\r\nnatural avenues by which one human soul can enter into and\r\nsubdue another.  His speech must be filled with music, and\r\npossess its miraculous charm and spell,\r\n\r\n  Which the posting winds recall,\r\n  And suspend the river's fall.\r\n\r\nHe must have the quality which Burke manifested when Warren\r\nHastings said, \"I felt, as I listened to him, as if I were\r\nthe most culpable being on earth\"; and which made Philip say\r\nof Demosthenes, \"Had I been there he would have persuaded\r\nme to take up arms against myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe has a present, practical purpose to accomplish.  If he\r\nfail in that he fails utterly and altogether.  His object is to\r\nconvince the understanding, to persuade the will, to set\r\naflame the heart of his audience or those who read what he\r\nsays.  He speaks for a present occasion.  Eloquence is the\r\nfeather that tips his arrow.  If he miss the mark he is a\r\nfailure, although his sentences may survive everything else\r\nin the permanent literature of the language in which he speaks.\r\nWhat he says must not only accomplish the purpose of the hour,\r\nbut should be fit to be preserved for all time, or he can\r\nhave no place in literature, and a small and ephemeral place\r\nin human memory.\r\n\r\nThe orator must know how so to utter his thought that it\r\nwill stay.  The poet and the orator have this in common.\r\nEach must so express and clothe his thought that it shall\r\npenetrate and take possession of the soul, and, having penetrated,\r\nmust abide and stay.  How this is done, who can tell?  Carlyle\r\ndefines poetry as a \"sort of lilt.\"  Cicero finds the secret\r\nof eloquence in a\r\n\r\n  Lepos quidem celeritasque et brevitas.\r\n\r\nOne writer lately dead, who has a masterly gift of noble\r\nand stirring eloquence, finds it in \"a certain collocation of\r\nconsonants.\"  Why it is that a change of a single word, or\r\neven of a single syllable, for any other which is an absolute\r\nsynonym in sense, would ruin the best line in Lycidas, or\r\ninjure terribly the noblest sentence of Webster, nobody knows.\r\nCurtis asks how Wendell Phillips did it, and answers his own\r\nquestion by asking you how Mozart did it.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that I am not sure that this is not the single\r\ngift most to be coveted by man, I may seem to have left out\r\nthe moral quality in my conception of what is excellent.  But\r\nsuch is the nature of man that the loftiest moral emotions\r\nare still the overmastering emotions.  The orator that does\r\nnot persuade men that righteousness is on his side will seldom\r\npersuade them to think or act as he desires; and if he fail\r\nin that he fails in his object; and the orator who has not\r\nin fact righteousness on his side will in general fail so to\r\npersuade them.  And even if in rare cases he do persuade\r\nhis audience, he does not gain a permanent place in literature.\r\nBolingbroke's speeches, though so enthusiastically praised\r\nby the best judges, have perished by their own worthlessness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the danger of the Republic, and his own, still occupied\r\nhis thoughts, Cicero found time in his old age to record,\r\nat the request of his brother Quintus, his opinion, _de omni\r\nratione dicendi._  It is not likely that the treatise \"de\r\nOratore\" or that \"de Claris Oratoribus\" will ever be matched\r\nby any other writer on this fascinating subject, except the\r\nbrief and masterly fragment of Tacitus.\r\n\r\nHe begins by inquiring why it is that, when so many persons\r\nstrive to attain the gift of eloquence, and its rewards of\r\nfame and wealth and power are so great, the number of those\r\nwho succeed as orators is so small in comparison with the\r\nnumber of those who become great generals, or statesmen,\r\nor poets.  I suppose this fact, which excited the wonder\r\nof Cicero, exists in our country and our time.  There is a\r\nforeign country which is to us as a posterity.  If we reckon\r\nthose Americans only as great orators who are accepted in\r\nEngland as such, or who, belonging to past generations are\r\nso accepted now by their own countrymen, the number is very\r\nsmall.  A few sentences of Patrick Henry are preserved, as\r\na few sentences of Lord Chatham are preserved.  The great\r\nthoughts of Webster justify, in the estimation of the reader,\r\nthe fame he enjoyed with his own generation.  The readers\r\nof Fisher Ames--alas, too few--can well comprehend the spell\r\nwhich persuaded an angry and reluctant majority to save the\r\ntreaty to which the nation had pledged its faith, and, perhaps,\r\nthe life of the nation itself.  With these exceptions, the\r\nnumber of American orators who will live in history as orators\r\ncan be counted on the fingers of one hand.\r\n\r\nI have never supposed myself to possess this gift.  The instruction\r\nwhich I had in my youth, especially that at Harvard, either\r\nin composition or elocution, was, I think, not only of no\r\nadvantage, but a positive injury.  Besides the absence of\r\ngood training, I had an awkward manner, and a harsh voice.\r\nUntil quite late in life I never learned to manage so that\r\nI could get through a long speech without serious irritation\r\nof the throat.  But I have had good opportunity to hear the\r\nbest public speaking of my time.  I have heard in England,\r\non a great field day in the House of Commons, Palmerston,\r\nLord John Russell, and John Bright, and, later, Disraeli,\r\nGladstone and Bernal Osborne.  I have heard Spurgeon, and\r\nBishop Wilberforce, and Dr. Guthrie in the pulpit.\r\n\r\nAt home I have heard a good many times Daniel Webster, Edward\r\nEverett, Rufus Choate, Robert C. Winthrop, John P. Hale,\r\nWendell Phillips, Charles Sumner, Richard H. Dana, Ralph\r\nWaldo Emerson, James G. Blaine, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, James\r\nA. Garfield, William McKinley, William M. Evarts, Benjamin\r\nF. Thomas, Pliny Merrick, Charles Devens, Nathaniel P. Banks,\r\nand, above all, Kossuth; and in the pulpit, James Walker,\r\nEdwards A. Park, Mark Hopkins, Edward Everett Hale, George\r\nPutnam, Starr King, and Henry W. Bellows.  So, perhaps, my\r\nexperience and observation, too late for my own advantage,\r\nmay be worth something to my younger readers.\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with the books which have been lately published\r\nwhich give directions for public speaking.  So I dare say\r\nthat what I have to advise is already well known to young\r\nmen, and that all I can say has been said much better.  But\r\nI will give the result of my own experience and observation.\r\n\r\nIn managing the voice, the speaker when he is engaged in earnest\r\nconversation, commonly and naturally falls into the best tone\r\nand manner for public speaking.  Suppose you are sitting about\r\na table with a dozen friends, and some subject is started\r\nin which you are deeply interested.  You engage in an earnest\r\nand serious dialogue with one of them at the other end of\r\nthe table.  You are perfectly at ease, not caring in the least\r\nfor your manner or tone of voice, but only for your thought.\r\nThe tone you adopt then will ordinarily be the best tone for\r\nyou in public speaking.  You can, however, learn from teachers\r\nor friendly critics to avoid any harsh or disagreeable fashion\r\nof speech that you may have fallen into, and that may be habitual\r\nto you in private conversation.\r\n\r\nNext.  Never strain your vocal organs by attempting to fill\r\nspaces which are too large for you.  Speak as loudly and\r\ndistinctly as you can do easily, and let the most distant\r\nportions of your audience go.  You will find in that way very\r\nsoon that your voice will increase in compass and power, and\r\nyou will do better than by a habit of straining the voice\r\nbeyond its natural capacity.  Be careful to avoid falsetto.\r\nShun imitating the tricks of speech of other orators, even\r\nof famous and successful orators.  These may do for them,\r\nbut not for you.  You will do no better in attempting to\r\nimitate the tricks of speech of other men in public speaking than\r\nin private speaking.\r\n\r\nNever make a gesture for the sake of making one.  I believe\r\nthat most of the successful speakers whom I know would find\r\nit hard to tell you whether they themselves make gestures\r\nor not, they are so absolutely unconscious in the matter.\r\nBut with gestures as with the voice, get teachers or friendly\r\ncritics to point out to you any bad habit you may fall into.\r\nI think it would be well if our young public speakers, especially\r\npreachers, would have competent instructors and critics among\r\ntheir auditors, after they enter their profession, to give\r\nthem the benefit of such observations and counsel as may be\r\nsuggested in that way.  If a Harvard professor of elocution\r\nwould retain his responsibility for his pupils five or ten\r\nyears after they got into active life he would do a great\r\ndeal more good than by his instructions to undergraduates.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been talking about mere manner.  The matter\r\nand substance of the orator's speech must depend upon the\r\nintellectual quality of the man.\r\n\r\nThe great orator must be a man of absolute sincerity.  Never\r\nadvocate a cause in which you do not believe, or affect an\r\nemotion you do not feel.  No skill or acting will cover up\r\nthe want of earnestness.  It is like the ointment of the\r\nhand which bewrayeth itself.\r\n\r\nI shall be asked how I can reconcile this doctrine with the\r\npractice of the law.  It will be said the advocate must often\r\ndefend men whom he believes to be guilty, or argue to the\r\ncourt propositions he believes to be unsound.  This objection\r\nwill disappear if we consider what exactly is the function\r\nof the advocate in our system of administering justice.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is needless to argue to persons of American\r\nor English birth that our system of administering justice is\r\nsafer for the innocent and, on the whole, secures the punishment\r\nof guilt and secures private right better than any other\r\nthat now exists or that ever existed among men.  The chief\r\ndistinction of the system we have inherited from England consists\r\nin two things:  first, the function of the advocate, and\r\nsecond, that cases are decided not upon belief, but upon\r\nproof.  It has been found that court or jury are more likely\r\nto get at truth if they have the aid of trained officers whose\r\nduty it shall be to collect and present all the arguments on\r\neach side which ought to be considered before the court or\r\njury reach the decision.  The man who seems clearly guilty\r\nshould not be condemned or punished unless every consideration\r\nwhich may tend to establish innocence or throw doubt upon\r\nguilt has been fully weighed.  The unassisted tribunal will\r\nbe quite likely to overlook these considerations.  Public\r\nsentiment approves the judgment and the punishment in the\r\ncase of John W. Webster.  But certainly he should never have\r\nbeen convicted without giving the fullest weight to his previous\r\ncharacter and to the slightness of the temptation to the commission\r\nof such a crime, to the fact that the evidence was largely\r\ncircumstantial, to the doubt of the identity of the body of\r\nthe victim, and to the fact that the means or instrument of\r\nthe crime which ordinarily must be alleged and proved in cases\r\nof murder could not be made certain, and could not be set\r\nforth in the indictment.  The question in the American or\r\nEnglish court is not whether the accused be guilty.  It is\r\nwhether he be shown to be guilty, by legal proof, of an offence\r\nlegally set forth.  It is the duty of the advocate to perform\r\nhis office in the mode best calculated to cause all such considerations\r\nto make their due impression.  It is not his duty or his right\r\nto express or convey his individual opinion.  On him the responsibility\r\nof the decision does not rest.  He not only has no right to\r\naccompany the statement of his argument with any assertion\r\nas to his individual belief, but I think the most experienced\r\nobservers will agree that such expressions, if habitual, tend\r\nto diminish and not to increase the just influence of the\r\nlawyer.  There was never a weightier advocate before New England\r\njuries than Daniel Webster.  Yet it is on record that he always\r\ncarefully abstained from any positiveness of assertion.  He\r\nintroduced his weightiest arguments with such phrases as,\r\n\"It will be for the jury to consider,\" \"The Court will judge,\"\r\n\"It may, perhaps, be worth thinking of, gentlemen,\" or some\r\nequivalent phrase by which he kept scrupulously off the ground\r\nwhich belonged to the tribunal he was addressing.  The tricks\r\nof advocacy are not only no part of the advocate's duties,\r\nbut they are more likely to repel than to attract the hearers.\r\nThe function of the advocate in the court of justice, as thus\r\ndefined and limited, is tainted by no insincerity or hypocrisy.\r\nIt is as respectable, as lofty, and as indispensably necessary\r\nas that of the judge himself.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the two most important things that a young\r\nman can do to make himself a good public speaker are:\r\n\r\nFirst.  Constant and careful written translations from Latin\r\nor Greek into English.\r\n\r\nSecond.  Practice in a good debating society.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that all the greatest Parliamentary orators\r\nof England are either men whom Lord North saw, or men who\r\nsaw Lord North--that is, men who were conspicuous as public\r\nspeakers in Lord North's youth, his contemporaries, and the\r\nmen who saw him as an old man when they were young themselves.\r\nThis would include Bolingbroke and would come down only to\r\nthe year of Lord John Russell's birth.  So we should have\r\nto add a few names, especially Gladstone, Disraeli, John Bright,\r\nand Palmerston.  There is no great Parliamentary orator in\r\nEngland since Gladstone died.  I once, a good many years ago,\r\nstudied the biographies of the men who belonged to that period\r\nwho were famous as great orators in Parliament or in Court,\r\nto find, if I could, the secret of their power.  With the\r\nexception of Lord Erskine and of John Bright, I believe every\r\none of them trained himself by careful and constant translation\r\nfrom Latin or Greek, and frequented a good debating society\r\nin his youth.\r\n\r\nBrougham trained himself for extemporaneous speaking in the\r\nSpeculative Society, the great theatre of debate for the University\r\nof Edinburgh.  He also improved his English style by translations\r\nfrom the Greek, among which is his well-known version of the\r\n\"Oration on the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nCanning's attention, while at Eton, was strongly turned to\r\nextemporaneous speaking.  They had a debating society, in\r\nwhich the Marquis of Wellesley and Charles Earl Grey had been\r\ntrained before him, in which they had all the forms of the\r\nHouse of Commons--Speaker, Treasury benches, and an Opposition.\r\nCanning also was disciplined by the habit of translation.\r\n\r\nCurran practised declamation daily before a glass, reciting\r\npassages from Shakespeare and the best English orators.  He\r\nfrequented the debating societies which then abounded in London.\r\nHe failed at first, and was ridiculed as \"Orator Mum.\" But\r\nat last he surmounted every difficulty.  It was said of him\r\nby a contemporary:  \"He turned his shrill and stumbling brogue\r\ninto a flexible, sustained, and finely modulated voice; his\r\naction become free and forcible; he acquired perfect readiness\r\nin thinking on his legs; he put down every opponent by the\r\nmingled force of his argument and wit; and was at last crowned\r\nwith the universal applause of the society and invited by\r\nthe president to an entertainment in their behalf.\" I am not\r\nsure that I have seen, on any good authority, that he was\r\nin the habit of writing translations from Latin or Greek,\r\nbut he studied them with great ardor and undoubtedly adopted,\r\namong the methods of perfecting his English style, the custom\r\nof students of his day of translation from these languages.\r\n\r\nJeffrey joined the Speculative Society, in Edinburgh, in\r\nhis youth.  His biographer says that it did more for him\r\nthan any other event in the whole course of his education.\r\n\r\nChatham, the greatest of English orators, if we may judge\r\nby the reports of his contemporaries, trained himself for\r\npublic speaking by constant translations from Latin and Greek.\r\nThe education of his son, the younger Pitt, is well known.\r\nHis father compelled him to read Thucydides into English at\r\nsight, and to go over it again and again, until he had got\r\nthe best possible rendering of the Greek into English.\r\n\r\nMacaulay belonged to the Cambridge Union, where, as in the\r\nsociety of the same name at Oxford, the great topics of the\r\nday were discussed by men, many of whom afterward became famous\r\nstatesmen and debaters in the Commons.\r\n\r\nYoung Murray, afterward Lord Mansfield, translated Sallust\r\nand Horace with ease; learned great part of them by heart;\r\ncould converse fluently in Latin; wrote Latin prose correctly\r\nand idiomatically, and was specially distinguished at Westminster\r\nfor his declamations.  He translated every oration of Cicero\r\ninto English and back again into Latin.\r\n\r\nFox can hardly have been supposed to have practised much in\r\ndebating societies, as he entered the House of Commons when\r\nhe was nineteen years old.  But it is quite probably that\r\nhe was drilled by translations from Latin and Greek into English;\r\nand in the House of Commons he had in early youth the advantage\r\nof the best debating society in the world.  It is said that\r\nhe read Latin and Greek as easily as he read English.  He\r\nhimself said that he gained his skill at the expense of the\r\nHouse, for he had sometimes tasked himself during the entire\r\nsession to speak on every question that came up, whether he\r\nwas interested in it or not, as a means of exercising and\r\ntraining his faculties.  This is what made him, according\r\nto Burke, \"rise by slow degrees to be the most brilliant and\r\naccomplished debater the world ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry Bulwer's \"Life of Palmerston\" does not tell us whether\r\nhe was trained by the habit of writing translations or in\r\ndebating societies.  But he was a very eager reader of the\r\nclassics.  There is little doubt, however, considering the\r\nhabit of his contemporaries at Cambridge, and that he was\r\nambitious for public life, and represented the University\r\nof Cambridge in Parliament just after he became twenty-one,\r\nthat he belonged to a debating society and that he was drilled\r\nin English composition by translation from the classics.\r\n\r\nGladstone was a famous debater in the Oxford Union, as is\r\nwell known, and was undoubtedly in the habit of writing translations\r\nfrom Greek and Latin, of which he was always so passionately\r\nfond.  He says in his paper on Arthur Hallam that the Eton\r\ndebating club known as the Society supplied the British Empire\r\nwith four Prime Ministers in fourscore years.\r\n\r\nThe value of the practice of translation from Latin or Greek\r\ninto English, in getting command of good English style, in\r\nmy judgment, can hardly be stated too strongly.  The explanation\r\nis not hard to find.  You have in these two languages and\r\nespecially in Latin, the best instrument for the most precise\r\nand most perfect expression of thought.  The Latin prose of\r\nTacitus and Cicero, the verse of Virgil and Horace, are like\r\na Greek statue, or an Italian cameo--you have not only exquisite\r\nbeauty, but also exquisite precision.  You get the thought\r\ninto your mind with the accuracy and precision of the words\r\nthat express numbers in the multiplication table.  Ten times\r\none are ten--not ten and one one-millionth.  Having got the\r\nidea into your mind with the precision, accuracy, and beauty\r\nof the Latin expression, you are to get its equivalent in\r\nEnglish.  Suppose you have knowledge of no language but your\r\nown.  The thought comes to you in the mysterious way in which\r\nthoughts are born, and struggles for expression in apt words.\r\nIf the phrase that occurs to you does not exactly fit the\r\nthought, you are almost certain, especially in speaking or\r\nrapid composition, to modify the thought to fit the phrase.\r\nYour sentence commands you, not you the sentence.  The extemporary\r\nspeaker never gets, or easily loses, the power of precise\r\nand accurate thinking or statement, and rarely attains a literary\r\nexcellence which gives him immortality.  But the conscientious\r\ntranslator has no such refuge.  He is confronted by the inexorable\r\noriginal.  He cannot evade or shirk.  He must try and try\r\nand try again until he has got the exact thought expressed\r\nin its English equivalent.  This is not enough.  He must get\r\nan English expression if the resources of the language will\r\nfurnish it, which will equal as near as may be the dignity\r\nand beauty of the original.  He must not give you pewter for\r\nsilver, or pinchbeck for gold, or mica for diamond.  This\r\npractice will soon give him ready command of the great riches\r\nof his own noble English tongue.  It will give a habitual\r\nnobility and beauty to his own style.  The best word and phrase\r\nwill come to him spontaneously when he speaks and thinks.\r\nThe processes of thought itself will grow easier.  The orator\r\nwill get the affluence and abundance which characterize the\r\ngreat Italian artists of the Middle Ages, who astonish us\r\nas much by the amount and variety of their work as by its\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nThe value of translation is very different from that of original\r\nwritten composition.  Cicero says:\r\n\r\n\"Stilus optimus et praestantissimus dicendi effector ac magister.\"\r\n\r\nOf this I am by no means sure.  If you write rapidly you\r\nget the habit of careless composition.  If you write slowly\r\nyou get the habit of slow composition.  Each of these is an\r\ninjury to the style of the speaker.  He cannot stop to correct\r\nor scratch out.  Cicero himself in a later passage states\r\nhis preference for translation.  He says that at first he used\r\nto take a Latin author, Ennius or Gracchus, and get the meaning\r\ninto his head, and then write it again.  But he soon found\r\nthat in that way if he used again the very words of his author\r\nhe got no advantage, and if he used other language of his\r\nown, the author had already occupied the ground with the best\r\nexpression, and he was left with the second best.  So he gave\r\nup the practice and adopted instead that of translating from\r\nthe Greek.\r\n\r\nBut to go back to what makes an orator.  As I have said,\r\nhis object is to excite the emotions which, being excited, will\r\nbe most likely to impel his audience to think or act as he\r\ndesires.  He must never disgust them, he must never excite\r\ntheir contempt.  He can use to great advantage the most varied\r\nlearning, the profoundest philosophy, the most compelling\r\nlogic.  He must master the subject with which he has to deal,\r\nand he must have knowledge adequate to illustrate and adorn\r\nit.  When every other faculty of the orator is acquired, it\r\nsometimes almost seems as if the voice were nine-tenths, and\r\neverything else but one-tenth, of the consummate orator.  It\r\nis impossible to overrate the importance to his purpose of\r\nthat matchless instrument, the human voice.\r\n\r\nThe most fastidious critic is by no means the best judge,\r\nseldom even a fairly good judge, of the public speaker.  He\r\nis likely to be a stranger to the emotion which the orator\r\ninspires and excites.  He is likely to fall into mistakes like\r\nthat which Goldwin Smith makes about Patrick Henry.  Mr.\r\nSmith ridicules Henry's speech and action and voice.  The\r\nemotion which the great Virginian stirred in the breasts of\r\nhis backwoodsmen seems very absurd to this cultured Englishman.\r\nThe bowing and changes of countenance and gesticulating of\r\nthe orator seem to him like the cheapest acting.  Yet to us\r\nwho understand it, it does not seem that Patrick Henry in\r\nthe old church at Richmond need yield the palm to Chatham\r\nin St. Stephen's Chapel, either for the grandeur of his theme\r\nor of his stage, or the sublimity of his eloquence.\r\n\r\nMatthew Arnold had the best pair of intellectual eyes of\r\nour time.  But he sometimes made a like mistake as a critic\r\nof poetry.  He speaks slightingly of Emerson's Fourth of\r\nJuly Ode--\r\n\r\n  Oh tenderly the haughty day\r\n  Fills his blue urn with fire;\r\n  One morn is in the mighty heaven,\r\n  And one in our desire.\r\n\r\nWhat did the Englishman know of the Fourth of July emotion\r\nwhich stirred all Americans in the days when the country\r\nhad just escaped destruction, and was entering upon its new\r\ncareer of freedom and of glory?  What could he understand\r\nof that feeling, full of the morning and of the springtime,\r\nwhich heard the cannon boom and the bells ring, with stirring\r\nand quickened pulse, in those exultant days?  Surely there\r\nnever was a loftier stroke than that with which the New England\r\npoet interpreted to his countrymen the feeling of that joyous\r\ntime--the feeling which is to waken again when the Fourth\r\nof July comes round on many anniversaries:\r\n\r\n  Oh tenderly the haughty day\r\n  Fills his blue urn with fire;\r\n  One morn is in the mighty heaven,\r\n  And one in our desire.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that if a speech read well it is not a good\r\nspeech.  There may be some truth in it.  The reader cannot,\r\nof course, get the impression which the speaker conveys by\r\nlook and tone and gesture.  He lacks that marvellous influence\r\nby which in a great assembly the emotion of every individual\r\nsoul is multiplied by the emotion of every other.  The reader\r\ncan pause and dwell upon the thought.  If there be a fallacy,\r\nhe is not hurried away to something else before he can detect\r\nit.  So, also, more careful and deliberate criticism will\r\ndiscover offences of style and taste which pass unheeded in\r\na speech when uttered.  But still the great oratoric triumphs\r\nof literature and history stand the test of reading in the\r\ncloset, as well as of hearing in the assembly.  Would not\r\nMark Anthony's speech over the dead body of Caesar, had it\r\nbeen uttered, have moved the Roman populace as it moves the\r\nspectator when the play is acted, or the solitary reader in\r\nhis closet?  Does not Lord Chatham's \"I rejoice that America\r\nhas resisted\" read well?  Do not Sheridan's great perorations,\r\nand Burke's, in the Impeachment of Warren Hastings, read well?\r\nDoes not \"Liberty and Union, Now and Forever!\" read well?\r\nDoes not \"Give me Liberty or Give me Death!\" read well?  Does\r\nnot Fisher Ames's speech for the treaty read well?  Do not\r\nEverett's finest passages read well?\r\n\r\nThere are examples of men of great original genius who have\r\nrisen to lofty oratory on some great occasion who had not\r\nthe advantage of familiarity with any great author.  But they\r\nare not only few in number, but the occasions are few when\r\nthey have risen to a great height.  In general the orator,\r\nwhether at the Bar, or in the pulpit, or in public life, who\r\nis to meet adequately the many demands upon his resources,\r\nmust get familiarity with the images and illustrations he\r\nwants, and the resources of a fitting diction, by soaking\r\nhis mind in some great authors which will alike satisfy and\r\nstimulate his imagination, and supply him with a lofty expression.\r\nOf these I suppose the best are, by common consent, the Bible,\r\nShakespeare, and Milton.  It is a maxim that the pupil who\r\nwishes to acquire a pure and simple style should give his\r\ndays and nights to Addison.  But there is a lack of strength\r\nand vigor in Addison, which perhaps prevents his being the\r\nbest model for the advocate in the court-house or the champion\r\nin a political debate.  I should rather, for myself, recommend\r\nRobert South to the student.  If the speaker, whose thought\r\nhave weight and vigor in it, can say it as South would have\r\nsaid it, he may be quite sure that his weighty meaning will\r\nbe expressed alike to the mind of the people and the apprehension\r\nof his antagonist.\r\n\r\nThere is one great difference between the condition of the\r\nAmerican orator and that of the orator of antiquity.  The\r\nspeaker, in the old time, addressed an audience about to act\r\ninstantly upon the emotions or convictions he had himself\r\ncaused.  Or he spoke to a Judge who was to give no reason\r\nfor his opinion.  The sense of public responsibility scarcely\r\nexisted in either.  The speech itself perished with the occasion,\r\nunless, as in some few instances, the orator preserved it\r\nin manuscript for a curious posterity.  Even then the best\r\nof them had discovered that not eloquence, but wisdom, is\r\nthe power by which states grow and flourish.\r\n\r\n\"Omnia plena consiliorum, inania verborum.\r\n\r\n\"Quid est tam furiosum quam verborum vel optimorum atque ornatissimorum\r\nsonitus inanis nulla subjecta sententia nec scientia?\"\r\n\r\nCicero's oratory is to excite his hearers, whether Judge\r\nor popular assembly, for the occasion.  Not so in general\r\nwith our orator.  The auditor is ashamed of excitement.  He\r\ntakes the argument home with him:  He sleeps on it.  He reads\r\nit again in the newspaper report.  He hears and reads the\r\nother side.  He discusses with friends and antagonists.  He\r\nfeels the responsibility of his vote.  He expects to have\r\nto justify it himself.  Even the juryman hears the sober\r\nstatement of the Judge, and talks the case over with his\r\nassociates of the panel in the quiet seclusion of the jury-room.\r\nThe Judge himself must state the reasons for his opinions,\r\nwhich are to be read by a learned and critical profession and\r\nby posterity.  The speaker's argument must be sounded, and\r\nrung, and tested, and tried again and again, before the auditor\r\nacts upon it.  Our people hear some great orators as they\r\nwitness a play.  The delight of taste, even intellectual\r\ngratification, caused by what is well said, is one thing.\r\nConviction is quite another.  The printing-press and the reporter,\r\nthe consultation in the jury-room, the reflection in the Judge's\r\nchamber, the delay of the election to a day long after the\r\nspeech, are protections against the mischief of mere oratory,\r\nwhich the ancients did not enjoy.\r\n\r\nI heard a debate in the House of Commons in 1860, on the\r\npaper duties, in which Lord John Russell, Palmerston, Gladstone,\r\nand John Bright took part.  Gladstone's part was not very\r\nprominent.  I now remember little that he said.  His image,\r\nas it then appeared, is effaced by his later appearance on\r\na much greater occasion.  Bright spoke admirably, both in\r\nmanner and matter.  He was an Independent, through giving\r\ngeneral support to the measures of the Government, in which\r\nPalmerston and Lord Russell were the leaders.  He complained\r\nbitterly of their acquiescence in what he thought the unconstitutional\r\nattitude of the House of Lords, in refusing to consent to\r\nthe abolition of the paper duties, for which the House of\r\nCommons had voted.  But the Government, though they had tried\r\nto abolish the duty, were very glad to hold on to the revenue.\r\nBright had none of the English hesitation, and frequent punctuation\r\nof sentences with--\"er\"--\"er\"--which has led some one, speaking\r\nof English orators, to say that \"to err\" is human.  He reminded\r\nme in general, in look, voice, and manner, of the late Richard\r\nH. Dana, although he sometimes threw more passion and zeal\r\ninto his speech than Dana ever indulged.  Periods followed\r\neach other in easy and rapid flow.  He had a fine voice and\r\ndelivery, easily filling the hall from his place below the\r\ngangway.\r\n\r\nPalmerston, in his jaunty and off-hand way, rebuked Bright\r\nfor desiring to make the House of Commons adopt a resolution\r\nwhich would only show its own helplessness.  On the whole,\r\nhe seemed to me to get the better of the debate.  Bright could\r\nnot persuade the House, or the people of England, to make\r\na great constitutional question out of the paper duties, especially\r\nafter the powerful speech of Lord Lyndhurst, who, then more\r\nthan ninety years old, argued for the side of the Lords with\r\na power that no other speaker on the subject rivalled.\r\n\r\nI heard Gladstone again in 1871, when there was a great struggle\r\nbetween him and Disraeli over the Parliamentary and Municipal\r\nElections Bill.  I visited the House with Thomas Hughes, to\r\nwhom I was indebted for much courtesy while in London, and\r\nhad a seat on the floor just below the gallery, where a few\r\nstrangers are, or were then, admitted by special card from\r\nthe Speaker.\r\n\r\nBernal Osborne, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Sir Stafford Northcote,\r\nGladstone, and Disraeli took part in the debate.  The bill\r\nwas introduced by Mr. Gladstone's Government.  The question\r\nthat night was on a motion to strike out the provision for\r\nthe secret ballot; so the opponents of the Government had\r\nto close in support of the motion.  The report of Hansard\r\npurports to be in the first person.  But I can testify from\r\nmemory that it is by no means verbally accurate.  I have no\r\ndoubt the speeches were taken down in short-hand.  The phonetic\r\nsystem was then used.  But the report seems to be about like\r\nthose which our good short-hand reporters used to make before\r\nthat invention.  The speeches are well worth studying by a\r\nperson who wishes to get an idea of the intellectual and literary\r\nquality of these champions.  There is no great passage in\r\nany one of them.  But the capacity and quality of power appear\r\ndistinctly.  Osborne was full of a shrewd and delightful wit,\r\nwithout the vitriolic flavor which often appears in the sarcasm\r\nof Disraeli.  Gladstone showed his power of elevating the\r\ndiscussion to a lofty plane, which his opponent never reached,\r\nalthough Disraeli launched at him many a keen shaft from\r\nbelow.  Mr. Hughes sat by me most of the night, and occasionally\r\nbrought and introduced to me some eminent person whom he thought\r\nI would like to know.\r\n\r\nThe members of our National House of Representatives, however\r\nturbulent or disorderly, never would submit to the fashion\r\nof treating a speaker whom they do not want to hear which\r\nprevails in the House of Commons.  When Mr. Gladstone got\r\nthrough, the night was far spent, and the House evidently\r\nwanted to hear Disraeli, then vote and go home.  Mr. Plunket,\r\na member for the University of Dublin, who seemed an intelligent\r\nand sensible man, rose, wishing to correct a statement of\r\nMr. Gladstone's, which he thought had done him an injustice.\r\nDisraeli rose about the same time, but bowed and gave way.\r\nThe House did not like it.  Poor Plunket's voice was drowned\r\nin the storm of shouts--\"Sit down.  Sit down.  Dizzy, Dizzy,\"\r\nin which my friend, Mr. Hughes, although of Gladstone's party,\r\njoined at the top of his lungs.  I think the Bedlam lasted\r\nfive minutes.  But Plunket stood his ground and made his correction.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bernal Osborne was a man of great wit and sense,\r\nand Sir Stafford Northcote and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach were\r\nthen, as the latter is now, very eminent characters, yet the\r\nonly speakers who belonged to the rank of the great orators\r\nwere Gladstone and Disraeli.  I will not undertake to add\r\nanother description of Gladstone to the many with which every\r\nreader of mine is thoroughly familiar.  The late Dr. Bellows\r\nresembled him very nearly, both in his way of reasoning and\r\nhis manner of speech.  Persons who have heard Dr. Bellows\r\nat his best will not deem this comparison unworthy.\r\n\r\nGladstone was terribly in earnest.  He began his speech by\r\na compliment to Northcote, his opponent, for whom he had shown\r\nhis esteem by sending him to the United States as one of the\r\nJoint High Commission to make the Alabama Treaty.  But when\r\nMr. Gladstone was well under way, Sir Stafford interposed\r\na dissent from something he said by calling out \"No, no\"--\r\na very frequent practice in the House.  Gladstone turned\r\nupon him savagely, with a tone of anger which I might almost\r\ncall furious:  \"Can the gentleman tolerate no opinion but\r\nhis own, that he interjects his audible contradiction into\r\nthe middle of my sentence?\"  The House evidently did not like\r\nit.  Hughes, who agreed with Gladstone, said to me: \"What\r\na pity it is that he cannot control his temper; that is his\r\ngreat fault.\"\r\n\r\nThere are no passages in this speech of Gladstone that can\r\nbe cited as among the best examples of the great style of\r\nthe orator.  But there are several that give a good idea of\r\nhis manner, and show something of the argument in two or\r\nthree sentences:  \"I am not at all ashamed of having said,\r\nand I will say it again, that this is a choice of evils.  I do not\r\nsay that the proposal for a secret ballot is open to no objections\r\nwhatever.  I admit that open voting has its evils as well\r\nas its merits.  One of these merits is that it enables a\r\nman to discharge a noble duty in the noblest possible manner.\r\nBut what are its demerits?  That by marking his vote you expose\r\nthe voter to be tempted through his cupidity and through his\r\nfears.  We propose, by secret voting, to greatly diminish\r\nthe first of these, and we hope to take away the second.  We\r\ndo not believe that the disposition to bribe can operate with\r\nanything like its present force when the means of tracing\r\nthe action of the man bribed are taken away, because men will\r\nnot pay for that they do not know they will ever receive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is too late for the honorable gentleman to say,\r\n'We are passing through an experiment; wait for more experiment.'\"\r\n\"We have already been debating this subject for forty years;\r\nwe have plenty of time on our hands; it is a Godsend to have\r\nanything to fill up our vacant hours; and therefore let us\r\npostpone the subject in order that it may be dealt with in\r\nfuture years.\"\r\n\r\nThe great quality of Gladstone, as of Sumner, is his profound\r\nseriousness.  He makes the impression on his hearers, an impression\r\nmade, but not so strongly, upon his readers, that the matter\r\nhe is discussing is that upon which the foundations of heaven\r\nand earth rest.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great mistake to hold Disraeli cheap.  He turned\r\nthe tables upon Osborne, who had gone into several, what Disraeli\r\ncalled, archaeological details, with respect to the antiquity\r\nof the ballot, and had cited a proclamation of Charles I.\r\nprohibiting the ballot in all corporations, either in the\r\ncity of London or elsewhere, which Disraeli said \"was done\r\nwith the admirable view of identifying the opinions of those\r\nwho sit on this side of the House with the political sentiments\r\nof that monarch.  But there was another assertion of the principle\r\nthat the ballot should be open that the gentleman has not\r\ncited.  That occurred in the most memorable Parliament that\r\never sat in England--the Long Parliament . . . . They wished\r\nit therefore to be exercised, not to satisfy the self-complacency\r\nof the individual, but with due respect for common-sense and\r\nthe public opinion of the country, and influenced by all those\r\ndoctrines and all that discipline of party which they believed\r\nto be one of the best securities for public liberty.\"\r\n\r\nGladstone showed in his speech the profounder reflection\r\non the general subject, the more philosophy, and the intenser\r\nearnestness; Disraeli showed quickness of wit, a ready command\r\nof his resources, ability for subtle distinctions, and glimpses\r\nof his almost Satanic capacity for mocking and jeering.  He\r\ndescribes Mr. Gladstone most felicitously as \"inspired by\r\na mixture of genius and vexation.\"  He speaks of his majority\r\nas a \"mechanical majority, a majority the result of heedlessness\r\nof thought on the part of members who were so full of other\r\nquestions that they gave pledges in favor of the ballot without\r\ndue consideration.\"\r\n\r\nHe said:  \"There is a celebrated river, which has been the\r\nsubject of political interest of late, and with which we\r\nare all acquainted.  It rolls its magnificent volume, clear and\r\npellucid, in its course; but it never reaches the ocean; it\r\nsinks into mud and morass.  And such will be the fate of\r\nthis mechanical majority.  The conscience of the country is\r\nagainst it.  It is an old-fashioned political expedient;\r\nit is not adapted to the circumstances which we have to encounter\r\nin the present, and because it has no real foundation of truth\r\nor policy, it will meet with defeat and discomfiture.\"\r\n\r\nGladstone had, what is quite rare, and what no famous American\r\norator that I now think of, except Choate and Evarts, have\r\nhad--a tendency to diffuse and somewhat involved speech, and\r\nat the same time a gift of compact epigrammatic utterance\r\non occasions.  When Mr. Evarts, who was my near relative,\r\nand a man with whom I could take a liberty, came into the\r\nSenate, I said to him that we should have to amend the rules\r\nso that a motion to adjourn would be in order in the middle\r\nof a sentence; to which he replied that he knew of nobody\r\nin this country, who objected to long sentences, except the\r\ncriminal classes.\r\n\r\nGladstone was the last of a school of oratory, and the last\r\nof our time--I hope not for all time--of a school of statesmen.\r\nWhen he entered upon a discussion in Parliament, or on the\r\nhustings, he elevated it to the highest possible plane.  The\r\ndiscussion became alike one of the highest moral principles\r\nand the profoundest political philosophy.  He seemed to be\r\nspeaking as our statesmen of the Revolutionary time, and the\r\ntime of framing our Constitution.  He used to speak to all\r\ngenerations alike.  What he had to say would have been true\r\nand apt and fit to be uttered in the earlier days of Athens\r\nand Rome, and true and apt and fit to be uttered for thousands\r\nof years to come.  He had, in a large measure, a failing which\r\nall Englishmen have, and always had; the notion that what\r\nis good for England is good for humanity at large.  Still\r\nit was a lofty morality and a lofty ideal statesmanship.  It\r\nwas sincere.  What he said, that he believed.  It came straight\r\nfrom his heart, and he kindled in the bosoms of his listeners\r\nthe ardor of his own heart.  He was not afraid of his ideals.\r\n\r\nI heard Dr. Guthrie in Edinburgh in 1860.  It was a hot day.\r\nMy companion was just getting well from a dangerous attack\r\nof bleeding at the lungs.  We made our way with difficulty\r\ninto the crowded church.  The people were, almost all of them,\r\nstanding.  We were obliged, by my friend's condition, to get\r\nout again before the sermon.  I remember, however, the old\r\nman's attitude, and his prayer in the racy, broad Scotch,\r\nthe most tender, pathetic and expressive language on earth\r\nfor the deeper emotions as well as for humor.  I wonder if\r\nmy readers have ever seen the version of the Psalms--\r\n\r\n\"Frae Hebrew Intil Scottis,\" by P. Hately Waddell, LL.D.,\r\nMinister, Edinburgh, 1891.\r\n\r\nIf not, and they will get it, a new delight is in store for\r\nthem, and they will know something of the diction of Dr.\r\nGuthrie.\r\n\r\nHe once began a prayer, \"O Lord, it is a braw thing to loe\r\nye.  But it is a better (bitter) thing to hate ye.\"\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this dialect is that while it is capable alike\r\nof such tenderness, and such lofty eloquence, and such exquisite\r\nand delicate humor, it is, like our Saxon, incapable of falsetto,\r\nor of little pomposities.\r\n\r\nI heard Lyman Beecher, then a very old man, before a meeting\r\nof the members of the Massachusetts Legislature in 1852, when\r\nthe measure known as the Maine Liquor Law was pending.  He\r\nbore unmistakable marks of advanced age.  But there were one\r\nor two passages that showed the power of the orator, one especially\r\nin which he described the beauty and delight of our homes,\r\nand intemperance threatening them with its waves like a great\r\nsea of fire.\r\n\r\nI saw Henry Ward Beecher several times in private, and had\r\npleasant talks with him.  But I am sorry to say I never heard\r\nhim speak, so far as I can now remember, on any occasion when\r\nhe put forth his power.  But if half that is told of his speeches,\r\nduring the Civil War, some of them to hostile and angry audiences,\r\nbe true, he was a consummate master.  One story is told of\r\nhim which I suppose is true, and, if it be true, ranks him\r\nas one of the greatest masters of his art that ever lived.\r\nIt is said that he was speaking to a great crowd in Birmingham,\r\nor perhaps Liverpool, which constantly goaded him with hostile\r\ninterruptions, so that he had great difficulty in getting\r\non.  At last one fellow provoked the cheers and applause of\r\nthe audience by crying out--\"Why didn't you put down the Rebellion\r\nin sixty days as you said you would?\" Beecher paused a moment\r\nuntil they became still, in their eagerness to hear his reply,\r\nand then hurled back--\"We should if they had been Englishmen.\"\r\nThe fierce, untamed animal hesitated a moment between anger\r\nand admiration, and then the English love of fair play and\r\npluck prevailed, and the crowd cheered him and let him go\r\non.\r\n\r\nBut any man who reads Beecher's delightful \"Letters from the\r\nWhite Mountains,\" or some of his sermons, and imagines his\r\ngreat frame, and far-sounding voice, will get a conception\r\nof his power to play on the feelings or men, of his humor,\r\nand pathos, and intense conviction, and rapidity in passing\r\nfrom one emotion to another, and will understand him.\r\n\r\nI heard Rufus Choate a great many times.  I heard nearly\r\nall the speeches given in Brown's Life; and I heard him a\r\ngreat many times at the Bar, both before juries and the full\r\nCourt.  He is the only advocate I ever heard who had the\r\nimperial power which would subdue an unwilling and hostile\r\njury.  His power over them seemed like the fascination of\r\na bird by a snake.  Of course, he couldn't do this with able\r\nJudges, although all Judges who listened to him would, I think,\r\nagree that he was as persuasive a reasoner as ever lived.\r\nBut with inferior magistrates and juries, however intelligent,\r\nhowever determined they were in a made-up opinion, however\r\non their guard against the charmer, he was almost irresistible.\r\nThere are very few important cases recorded that Choate lost.\r\nNon supplex, sed magister aut dominus videretur esse judicum.\r\n\r\nChoate's method was pure persuasion.  He never appealed to\r\nbase motives, nor tried to awake coarse prejudices or stormy\r\npassions.  He indulged in no invective.  His wit and sarcasm\r\nand ridicule amused the victim almost as much as it amused\r\nthe bystander.  He had the suaviloquentia which Cicero attributes\r\nto Cornelius.  There was never a harsh note in his speech.\r\n\r\n  Latrantur enim jam quidam oratores, non loquuntur.\r\n\r\nWhen he was confronted with some general rule, or some plain\r\nfact, he had a marvellous art of subtle distinction.  He\r\nshowed that his client, or witness, or proposition, belonged\r\nto a class of itself.  He invested it with a distinct and\r\nintense personality.  He held up his fact or his principle\r\nbefore the mind of the Court and the jury.  He described\r\nand pictured it.  He brought out in clear relief what distinguished\r\nit from any other fact or proposition whatever.  If necessary,\r\nhe would almost have made a jury, before he was through, think\r\nthe Siamese twins did not look alike, and possibly that they\r\nnever could have been born of the same parents.\r\n\r\nHe had a voice without any gruff or any shrill tones.  It\r\nwas like a sweet, yet powerful flute.  He never strained it\r\nor seemed to exert it to its fullest capacity.  I do not know\r\nany other public speaker whose style resembled his in the\r\nleast.  Perhaps Jeremy Taylor was his model, if he had any\r\nmodel.  The phraseology with which he clothed some commonplace\r\nor mean thought or fact, when he was compelled to use commonplace\r\narguments, or to tell some common story, kept his auditors\r\never alert and expectant.  An Irishman, who had killed his\r\nwife, threw away the axe with which Choate claimed the deed\r\nwas done, when he heard somebody coming.  This, in Choate's\r\nlanguage, was \"the sudden and frantic ejaculation of the axe.\"\r\nIndeed his speech was a perpetual surprise.  Whether you liked\r\nhim or disliked him, you gave him your ears, erect and intent.\r\nHe used manuscript a great deal, even in speaking to juries.\r\nWhen a trial was on, lasting days or weeks, he kept pen, ink,\r\nand paper at hand in his bedroom, and would often get up in\r\nthe middle of the night to write down thoughts that came to\r\nhim as he lay in bed.  He was always careful to keep warm.\r\nIt was said he prepared for a great jury argument by taking\r\noff eight great coats and drinking eight cups of green tea.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young lawyer in Worcester I had something to\r\ndo before the Court sitting in the fourth story of the old\r\nstone court house in Boston.  I finished my business and\r\nhad just time to catch the train for home.  As I came down\r\nthe stairs I passed the door of the court-room where the\r\nUnited States Court was sitting.  The thick wooden door was\r\nopen, and the opening was closed by a door of thin leather\r\nstretched on a wooden frame.  I pulled it open enough to look\r\nin, and there, within three feet of me, was Choate, addressing\r\na jury in a case of marine insurance, where the defence was\r\nthe unseaworthiness of the vessel.  I had just time to hear\r\nthis sentence, and shut the door and hurry to my train: \"She\r\nwent down the harbor, painted and perfidious--a coffin, but\r\nno ship.\"\r\n\r\nI hear now, as if still in the eager throng, his speech in\r\nFaneuil Hall during the Mexican War.  He demanded that we\r\nshould bring back our soldiers to the line we claimed as\r\nour rightful boundary, and let Mexico go.  He said we had\r\ndone enough for glory, and that we had humiliated her enough.\r\n\r\n\"The Mexican maiden, as she sits with her lover among the\r\norange-groves, will sing to her guitar the story of these\r\ntimes--'Ah, woe is me, Alhama,' for a thousand years to come.\"\r\n\r\nChoate, like other good orators, and like some great poets,\r\nnotably Wordsworth, created the taste which he satisfied.\r\nHis dramatic action, his marvellous and strange vocabulary,\r\nhis oriental imagination, his dressing the common and mean\r\nthings of life with a poetic charm and romance, did not at\r\nonce strike favorably the taste of his Yankee audiences.\r\nWebster and Everett seem to have appreciated him from the\r\nfirst.  But he was, till he vindicated his title to be a great\r\nlawyer, rather a thorn in the flesh of Chief Justice Shaw, of\r\nwhose consternation and amazement, caused by the strange\r\nfigure that appeared in his court-room, many queer stories\r\nused to be told.  But the young men and the people liked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Non probantur haec senibus--saepe videbam cum invidentem\r\ntum etiam irascentem stomachantem Philippum--sed mirantur\r\nadulescentes multitudo movetur.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a curious sight to see on a jury twelve hard-headed\r\nand intelligent countrymen--farmers, town officers, trustees,\r\nmen chosen by their neighbors to transact their important\r\naffairs--after an argument by some clear-headed lawyer for\r\nthe defence, about some apparently not very doubtful transaction,\r\nwho had brought them all to his way of thinking, and had warned\r\nthem against the wiles of the charmer, when Choate rose to\r\nreply for the plaintiff--to see their look of confidence and\r\ndisdain--\"You needn't try your wiles upon me.\" The shoulder\r\nturned a little against the speaker--the averted eye--and\r\nthen the change; first, the changed posture of the body; the\r\nslight opening of the mouth; then the look, first, of curiosity,\r\nand then of doubt, then of respect; the surrender of the eye\r\nto the eye of the great advocate; then the spell, the charm,\r\nthe great enchantment--till at last, jury and audience were\r\nall swept away, and followed the conqueror captive in his\r\ntriumphal march.\r\n\r\nHe gesticulated with his whole body.  Wendell Phillips most\r\nirreverently as well as most unjustly compared him to a monkey\r\nin convulsions.  His bowings down and straightening himself\r\nagain were spoken of by another critic, not unfriendly, as\r\nopening and shutting like a jack-knife.  His curly black hairs\r\nseemed each to have a separate life of its own.  His eyes\r\nshone like coals of fire.  There is a passage of Everett's\r\nwhich well describes Choate, and is also one of the very best\r\nexamples of Everett, who, with all his fertility of original\r\ngenius, borrowed so much, and so enriched and improved everything\r\nthat he borrowed.  Cicero said of Antonius:\r\n\r\n\"Omnia veniebant Antonio in mentem; eaque suo quaeque loco,\r\nubi pluimum proficere et valere possent, ut ab imperatore\r\nequites pedites levis armatura, sic ab illo in maxume opportunis\r\norationis partibus conlocabantur.\"\r\n\r\nNow see what Everett does with this thought in his eulogy,\r\nspoken in Faneuil Hall, the week after Choate's death:\r\n\r\n\"He is sometimes satisfied, in concise epigrammatic clauses,\r\nto skirmish with his light troops, and drive in the enemy's\r\noutposts.  It is only on fitting occasions, when great principles\r\nare to be vindicated, and solemn truths told, when some moral\r\nor political Waterloo or Solferino is to be fought, that he\r\nputs on the entire panoply of his gorgeous rhetoric.  It is\r\nthen that his majestic sentences swell to the dimensions\r\nof his majestic thought; then it is that we hear afar off the\r\nawful roar of his rifled ordnance; and when he has stormed\r\nthe heights, and broken the centre, and trampled the squares,\r\nand turned the staggering wings of the adversary, that he\r\nsounds his imperial clarion along the whole line of battle,\r\nand moves forward with all his hosts, in one overwhelming\r\ncharge.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable advocates of my day was Sidney\r\nBartlett.  He seldom addressed juries, and almost never public\r\nassemblies.  He was a partner of Chief Justice Shaw before\r\n1830.  He argued cases before the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates and before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts after\r\nhe was ninety.  He cared for no other audience.  He had a\r\nmarvellous compactness of speech, and a marvellous sagacity\r\nin seeing the turning-point of a great question.  He found\r\nthe place where the roads diverged, got the Court's face set\r\nin the right direction, and then stopped.  He would argue\r\nin ten or fifteen minutes a point where some powerful antagonist\r\nlike Curtis or Choate would take hours to reply.  I once told\r\nhim that his method of argument was to that of ordinary lawyers\r\nlike logarithms to ordinary mathematics.  He seemed pleased\r\nwith the compliment, and said, \"Yes, I know I argue over their\r\nheads.  The Chief Justice told me he wished I would talk a\r\nlittle longer.\" I do not know that Bartlett ought to be reckoned\r\namong orators.  But he had a great power of convincing, and\r\ngiving his intellectual delight to minds capable of appreciating\r\nhis profound and inexorable logic.\r\n\r\nEdward Everett seems to me, on the whole, our best example\r\nof the orator, pure and simple.  Webster was a great statesman,\r\na great lawyer, a great advocate, a great public teacher.\r\nTo all these his matchless oratory was but an instrument and\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nChoate was a great winner of cases, and as relaxation he\r\ngave, in the brief vacations of an overworked professional\r\nlife (he once defined a lawyer's vacation as the time after he\r\nhas put a question to a witness while he is waiting for an\r\nanswer), a few wonderful literary and historical addresses.\r\nHe gave a brief period of brilliant but most unwilling service\r\nin each House of Congress.  He made some powerful political\r\nspeeches to popular audiences.  But his heart was always in\r\nthe court-house.  No gambler ever hankered for the feverish\r\ndelight of the gaming table as Choate did for that absorbing\r\ngame, half chance, half skill, where twelve human dice must\r\nall turn up together one way, or there be no victory.\r\n\r\nBut Everett is always the orator.  He was a clergyman a little\r\nwhile.  He was a Greek professor a little while.  He was a\r\nCollege President a little while.  He was a Minister to England\r\na little while.  He was Representative in Congress and Senator.\r\nHe was Governor of the Commonwealth.  In these places he did\r\ngood service enough to make a high reputation for any other\r\nman.  Little of these things is remembered now.  He was above\r\nall things--I am tempted to say, above all men--the foremost\r\nAmerican orator in one class.\r\n\r\nThere is one function of the orator peculiar to our country,\r\nand almost unknown elsewhere.  That is the giving utterance\r\nto the emotion of the people, whether of joy or sorrow, on\r\nthe occasions when its soul is deeply stirred--when some great\r\nman dies, or there is a great victory or defeat, or some notable\r\nanniversary is celebrated.  This office was filled by other\r\nmen, on some few occasions by Daniel Webster himself, but\r\nby no man better than by Everett.  A Town, or City, or State\r\nis very human.  In sorrow it must utter its cry of pain; in\r\nvictory, its note of triumph.  As events pass, it must pronounce\r\nits judgement.  Its constant purpose must be fixed and made\r\nmore steadfast by expression.  It must give voice to its love\r\nand its approbation and its condemnation.  It must register\r\nthe high and low water mark of its tide, its rising and its\r\nsinking in heat and cold.  This office Edward Everett, for\r\nnearly fifty years, performed for Massachusetts and for the\r\nwhole country.  In his orations is preserved and recorded\r\neverything of the emotion of the great hours of our people's\r\nhistory.  The camera of his delicate photography has preserved\r\nfor future generations what passed in the soul of his own\r\nin the times that tried the souls of men.\r\n\r\nI do not know where he got his exquisite elocution.  He went\r\nabroad in his youth, and there were good trainers abroad,\r\nthen.  He must have studied thoroughly the speeches of Cicero\r\nand the Greek orators.  Many casual phrases in his works,\r\nbesides many quotations, show his familiarity with Cicero's\r\nwriting on oratory.\r\n\r\nIf you would get some faint, far-off conception of him, first\r\nlook at the best bust or picture of Everett you can find.\r\nImagine the figure with its every movement gentle and graceful.\r\nThe head and face are suggestive of Greek sculpture.  This\r\nperson sits on the platform with every expression discharged\r\nfrom the face, looking like a plaster image when the artist\r\nhas just begun his model, before any character or intelligence\r\nhas been put into it.  You think him the only person in the\r\naudience who takes no interest whatever in what is going on,\r\nand certainly that he expects to have nothing to do with it\r\nhimself.  He is introduced.  He comes forward quietly and\r\ngracefully.  There is a slight smile of recognition of the\r\nwelcoming applause.  The opening sentences are spoken in a\r\nsoft--I had almost said, a caressing voice, though still a\r\nlittle cold.  I suppose it would be called a tenor voice.\r\nThere was nothing in the least unmanly about Edward Everett.\r\nYet if some woman had spoken in the same tones, you would\r\nhave not thought them unwomanly.\r\n\r\n  Illa tamquam cycnea fuit divini hominis vox et oratio.\r\n\r\nHe has found somewhere in the vast storehouse of his knowledge\r\na transaction exactly like the present, or exactly in contrast\r\nwith it, or some sentiment of poet or orator which just fits\r\nthe present occasion.  If it be new to his audience, he adds\r\nto it a newer delight still by his matchless skill as a narrator--\r\na skill almost the rarest of all talents among public speakers.\r\nIf it be commonplace and hackneyed he makes it fresh and pleasant\r\nby giving in detail the circumstances when it was first uttered,\r\nor describes some occasion when some orator has applied it\r\nbefore; or calls attention to its very triteness as giving\r\nit added authority.  If he wish to express his agreement with\r\nthe last speaker and \"say ditto to Mr. Burke,\" he tells you\r\nwhen that was said, what was the occasion, and gives you the\r\nname of Mr. Kruger, who stood for the representation of Bristol\r\nwith Burke.\r\n\r\nMr. Everett's stores were inexhaustible.  If any speaker\r\nhave to get ready in a hurry for a great occasion, let him\r\nlook through the index of the four volumes of Everett's speeches,\r\nand he will find matter enough, not only to stimulate his\r\nown thought and set its currents running, but to illustrate\r\nand adorn what he will say.\r\n\r\nBut pretty soon the orator rises into a higher plane.  Some\r\nlofty sentiment, some stirring incident, some patriotic emotion,\r\nsome play of fancy or wit comes from the brain or heart of\r\nthe speaker.  The audience is hushed to silence.  Perhaps\r\na little mist begins to gather in their eyes.  There is now\r\nan accent of emotion in the voice, though still soft and\r\ngentle.  The Greek statue begins to move.  There is life in\r\nthe limbs.  There has been a lamp kindled somewhere behind\r\nthe clear and transparent blue eyes.  The flexible muscles\r\nof the face have come to life now.  Still there is no jar or\r\ndisorder.  The touch upon the nerves of the audience is like\r\nthat of a gentle nurse.  The atmosphere is that of a May\r\nmorning.  There is no perfume but that of roses and lilies.\r\nBut still, gently at first, the warmer feelings are kindled in\r\nthe hearts of the speaker and hearers.  The frame of the\r\nspeaker is transfigured.  The trembling hands are lifted\r\nhigh in the air.  The rich, sweet voice fills the vast audience\r\nchamber with its resonant tones.  At last, the bugle, the\r\ntrumpet, the imperial clarion rings out full and clear, and\r\nthe vast audience is transported as to another world--I had\r\nalmost said to a seventh heaven.  Read the welcome to Lafayette\r\nor the close of the matchless eulogy on that illustrious object\r\nof the people's love.  Read the close of the oration on Washington.\r\nRead the contrast of Washington and Marlborough.  Read the\r\nbeautiful passage where, just before the ocean cable was laid,\r\nthe rich fancy of the speaker describes--\r\n\r\n\"The thoughts that we think up here on the earth's surface\r\nin the cheerful light of day--clothing ourselves with elemental\r\nsparks, and shooting with fiery speed in a moment, in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, from hemisphere to hemisphere, far down\r\namong the uncouth monsters that wallow in the nether seas,\r\nalong the wreck-paved floor, thorough the oozy dungeons of\r\nthe rayless deep; the last intelligence of the crops, whose\r\ndancing tassels will in a few months be coquetting with the\r\nwest wind on those boundless prairies, flashing along the\r\nslimy decks of old sunken galleons, which have been rotting\r\nfor ages; messages of friendship and love, from warm, living\r\nbosoms, burn over the cold green bones of men and women, whose\r\nhearts, once as fond as ours, burst as the eternal gulfs\r\nclosed and roared over them, centuries ago.\"\r\n\r\nRead the passage in the eulogy on Choate where he describes\r\nhim arming himself in the entire panoply of his gorgeous\r\nrhetoric--and you will get some far-away conception of the\r\npower of this magician.\r\n\r\nOne thing especially distinguishes our modern orator from\r\nthe writer in the closet, where he writes solely for his readers,\r\nor where he has prepared his speeches beforehand--that is,\r\nthe influence of the audience upon him.  There is nothing\r\nlike it as a stimulant to every faculty, not only imagination,\r\nand fancy, and reason, but especially, as every experienced\r\nspeaker knows, memory also.  Everything needed seems to come\r\nout from the secret storehouses of the mind, even the things\r\nthat have lain there forgotten, rusting and unused.  Mr. Everett\r\ndescribes this in a masterly passage in his Life of Webster.\r\nGladstone states it in a few fine sentences:\r\n\r\n\"The work of the orator, from its very inception,\" he says,\r\n\"is inextricably mixed up with practice.  It is cast in the\r\nmould offered to him by the mind of his hearers.  It is an\r\ninfluence principally received from his audience (so to speak)\r\nin vapor, which he pours back upon them in a flood.  The sympathy\r\nand concurrence of his time is, with his own mind, joint parent\r\nof his work.  He cannot follow nor frame ideals; his choice\r\nis to be what his age would have him, what it requires in\r\norder to be moved by him, or else not to be at all.\"\r\n\r\nI heard six of Kossuth's very best speeches.  He was a marvellous\r\norator.  He seemed to have mastered the whole vocabulary of\r\nEnglish speech, and to have a rare gift of choosing words\r\nthat accurately expressed his meaning, and he used so to fashion\r\nhis sentences that they were melodious and delightful to the\r\near.  That is one great gift or oratory, as it is of poetry,\r\nor indeed of a good prose style.  Why it is that two words\r\nor phrases which mean precisely the same thing to the intellect,\r\nhave so different an effect on the emotions, no man can tell.\r\nTo understand it, is to know the secret not only of reaching\r\nthe heart, but frequently of convincing the understanding\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nKossuth made a great many speeches, sometimes five or six\r\nin a day.  He could have had no preparation but the few minutes\r\nwhich he could snatch while waiting for dinner at some house\r\nwhere he was a guest, or late at night, after a hard day's\r\nwork.  But his speeches were gems.  They were beautiful in\r\nsubstance and in manner.  He was ready for every occasion.\r\nWhen the speaker who welcomed him at Roxbury told him that\r\nRoxbury contained no historic spot that would interest a stranger,\r\nKossuth at once answered, \"You forget that it is the birthplace\r\nof Warren.\"  When old Josiah Quincy, then past eighty, said\r\nat a Legislative banquet that he had come to the time--\"when\r\nthe keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men\r\nshall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they\r\nare few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,\r\nand they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears\r\nshall be in the way,\" Kossuth interrupted him, \"Ah! but that\r\nwas of ordinary men.\"\r\n\r\nI was a member of the Legislature when Kossuth visited Boston.\r\nI heard his address to the House and to the Senate, his reply\r\nto the Governor's welcome.  I heard him again at the Legislative\r\nbanquet in Faneuil Hall, and twice in Worcester--on the Common\r\nin the afternoon, and at the City Hall in the evening.  I\r\nshook hands with him and perhaps exchanged a word or two,\r\nbut of that I have no memory.  Afterward I visited him with\r\nmy wife at Turin in 1892, when he was a few months past ninety.\r\nHe received me with great cordiality.  I spent two hours with\r\nhim and his sister, Madam Ruttkay.  They both expressed great\r\npleasure with the visit, and Madam Ruttkay kissed Mrs. Hoar\r\naffectionately when we took leave.  Kossuth's beautiful English\r\nperiods were as beautiful as they were forty years before,\r\nat the time of his famous pilgrimage through the United States.\r\nHis whole conversation related to the destiny of his beloved\r\nHungary.  He spoke with great dignity of his own share in\r\nthe public events which affected his country.  There was nothing\r\nof arrogance or vanity in his claim for himself, yet in speaking\r\nof Francis Joseph, he assumed unconsciously the tone of a\r\nsuperior.  He maintained that constitutional liberty could\r\nnever be permanent where two countries with separate legislatures\r\nwere under one sovereign.  He said the sovereign would always\r\nbe able to use the military and civil power of one to accomplish\r\nhis designs against the liberty of the other.  The opinion\r\nof Kossuth on such a question is entitled to the greatest\r\ndeference.  But I incline to the belief that, while undoubtedly\r\nthere may be great truth in the opinion, the spirit of liberty\r\nwill overcome that danger.  Hungary and Hungary's chief city\r\nseem rapidly to be asserting control in their own affairs\r\nand an influence in the Austro-Hungary Empire which no monarch\r\nwill be able to withstand, and which it is quite likely the\r\nroyal family will not desire to withstand.  In these days\r\nmonarchs are learning the love of liberty, and I believe\r\nin most cases to-day the reigning sovereigns of Europe are\r\neager to promote constitutional government, and prefer the\r\ntitle of Liberator to that of Despot.\r\n\r\nI have heard Wendell Phillips speak a great many times.  I\r\ndo not include him in this notice, because, if I did, I ought\r\nto defend my estimate of him at considerable length, and to\r\njustify it by ample quotation.  I think him entitled to the\r\nvery highest rank as an orator.  I do not estimate his moral\r\ncharacter highly.  I think he exerted very little influence on\r\nhis generation, and that the influence he did exert was in the\r\nmain pernicious.  I have had copied everything he said, from\r\nthe time he made his first speech, so far as it is found in\r\nthe newspapers, and have the volumes in which his speeches\r\nare collected.  I never had occasion to complain of him on\r\nmy own account.  So far as I know and believe, he had the\r\nkindliest feeling for me until his death, and esteemed my\r\npublic service much more highly than it deserved.  But he\r\nbitterly and unjustly attacked men whom I loved and honored\r\nunder circumstances which make it impossible for me to believe\r\nthat his conduct was consistent with common honesty.  He seemed\r\nnever to care for the soundness of his opinion before he uttered\r\nit, or for the truth of the fact before he said it, if only\r\nhe could produce a rhetorical effect.  He seemed to like to\r\ndefame men whom the people loved and honored.  Toward the\r\nlatter part of his life, he seemed to get desperate.  If he\r\nfailed to make an impression by argument, he took to invective.\r\nIf vinegar would not answer he resorted to cayenne pepper.\r\nIf that failed, he tried to throw vitriol in the eyes of the\r\nmen whom he hated.  His remedy for slavery was to destroy\r\nthe country, and to leave the slave to the unchecked will\r\nof the South.  During Lincoln's great trial, he attacked and\r\nvilified him.  At the time when nearly every household in\r\nthe North was mourning for its dead, he tried to persuade\r\nthe people that Lincoln did not mean to put down the Rebellion.\r\nHe never gave the people wise counsel, and rarely told them\r\nthe honest truth.  He rarely gave his homage to anybody.  When\r\nhe did, it was to bad men, and not to good men.\r\n\r\nThere can be no worse influence upon the youth of the Republic\r\nthan that which shall induce them to approve sentiments, not\r\nbecause they are true, but only because they are eloquently\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\nTRUSTS\r\n\r\nI have given the best study I could to the grave evil of the\r\naccumulation in the country of vast fortunes in single hands,\r\nor of vast properties in the hands of great corporations--\r\npopularly spoken of as trusts--whose powers are wielded by\r\none, or a few persons.  This is the most important question\r\nbefore the American people demanding solution in the immediate\r\nfuture.  A great many remedies have been proposed, some with\r\nsincerity and some, I am afraid, merely for partisan ends.\r\nThe difficulty is increased by the fact that many of the evils\r\ncaused by trusts, or apprehended from them, can only be cured\r\nby the action of the States, but cannot be reached by Congress,\r\nwhich can only deal with international or interstate commerce.\r\nAs long ago as 1890 the people were becoming alarmed about\r\nthis matter.  But the evil has increased rapidly during the\r\nlast twelve years.  It is said that one man in this country\r\nhas acquired a fortune of more than a thousand million dollars\r\nby getting an advantage over other producers or dealers in\r\na great necessary of life in the rates at which the railroads\r\ntransport his goods to market.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 a bill was passed which was called the Sherman Act,\r\nfor no other reason I can think of except that Mr. Sherman\r\nhad nothing to do with framing it whatever.  He introduced\r\na bill and reported it from the Finance Committee providing\r\nthat whenever a trust, as it was called, dealt with an article\r\nprotected by the tariff, the article should be put on the\r\nfree list.  This was a crude, imperfect, and unjust provision.\r\nIt let in goods made abroad by a foreign trust to compete\r\nwith the honest domestic manufacturer.  If there happened\r\nto be an industry employing thousands or hundreds of thousands\r\nof workmen, in which thousands of millions of American capital\r\nwas invested, and a few persons got up a trust--perhaps importers,\r\nfor the very purpose of breaking down the American manufacturer--\r\nand made the article to a very small extent, all honest manufacturers\r\nwould be deprived of their protection.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman's bill found little favor with the Senate.  It\r\nwas referred to the Judiciary Committee of which I was then\r\na member.  I drew as an amendment the present bill which I\r\npresented to the Committee.  There was a good deal of opposition\r\nto it in the Committee.  Nearly every member had a plan of\r\nhis own.  But at last the Committee came to my view and reported\r\nthe law of 1890.  The House disagreed to our bill and the\r\nmatter went to a Conference Committee, of which Mr. Edmunds,\r\nthe Chairman of the Committee, and I, as the member of the\r\nCommittee who was the author of the bill, were members.  The\r\nHouse finally came to our view.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the Court, in administering that law,\r\nwould confine its operation to cases which are contrary to the\r\npolicy of the law, treating the words \"agreements in restraint\r\nof trade,\" as having a technical meaning, such as they are\r\nsupposed to have in England.  The Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates went in this particular farther than was expected.\r\nIn one case it held that \"the bill comprehended every scheme\r\nthat might be devised to restrain trade or commerce among\r\nthe several States or with foreign nations.\" From this opinion\r\nseveral of the Court, including Mr. Justice Gray, dissented.\r\nIt has not been carried to its full extent since, and I think\r\nwill never be held to prohibit the lawful and harmless combinations\r\nwhich have been permitted in this country and in England without\r\ncomplaint, like contracts of partnership which are usually\r\nconsidered harmless.  We thought it was best to use this general\r\nphrase which, as we thought, had an accepted and well-known\r\nmeaning in the English law, and then after it had been construed\r\nby the Court, and a body of decisions had grown up under\r\nthe law, Congress would be able to make such further amendments\r\nas might be found by experience necessary.\r\n\r\nThe statute has worked very well indeed, although the Court\r\nby one majority and against the very earnest and emphatic\r\ndissent of some of its greatest lawyers, declined to give\r\na technical meaning to the phrase, \"in restraint of trade.\"\r\nBut the operation of the statute has been healthy.  The Attorney-\r\nGeneral has recently given an account of suits in equity by\r\nwhich he had destroyed a good many vast combinations, including\r\na combination of the six largest meat-packing concerns in\r\nthe country; a combination of railroads which had been restrained\r\nfrom making any rebate or granting any preference whatever\r\nto any shipper; and a pooling arrangement between the Southern\r\nrailroads which denied the right of the shippers interested\r\nin the cotton product in the South to prescribe the route\r\nover which their goods should pass.  He has also brought a\r\nsuit in equity to prevent the operation of a proposed merger\r\nof sundry transcontinental railroads, thereby breaking up\r\na monopoly which affected the whole freight and passenger\r\ntraffic of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe public uneasiness, however, still continued.  The matter\r\nwas very much discussed in the campaign for electing members\r\nof the House of Representatives in the autumn of 1902.\r\n\r\nI made two or three careful speeches on the subject in Massachusetts,\r\nin which I pointed out that the existing law, in general,\r\nwas likely to be sufficient.  I claimed, however, further,\r\nthat Congress had, in my opinion, the power of controlling\r\nthe whole matter, by reason of its right to prescribe terms\r\non which any corporation, created by State authority or its\r\nown, should engage in interstate or international commerce.\r\nIt might provide as a condition for such traffic by a corporation,\r\nthat its officers or members should put on file an obligation\r\nto be personally liable for the debts of the concern in case\r\nthe conditions prescribed by Congress were not complied with.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives passed a very stringent bill\r\nknown as the Littlefield Bill, which was amended by the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, of which I was the Chairman, by adding the provisions\r\nof a bill which I had, myself, previously introduced, based\r\non the suggestions above stated.\r\n\r\nBut there was a general feeling that the amendments to the\r\nexisting law proposed by the Administration were all that\r\nshould be made at present.  These consisted in providing\r\nsevere penalties for granting rebates by railroads to favored\r\nshippers; for having suits under the existing law brought\r\nforward for prompt decision, and for giving the new Department\r\nof Commerce large powers for the examination of the conduct\r\nof the business of such corporations, and to compel them to\r\nmake such returns as should be thought desirable.\r\n\r\nI should have preferred to have the bill I reported brought\r\nforward and discussed in the Senate, although there was obviously\r\nno time, with the pressure of other business, to get it through.\r\nBut it was thought best by a majority of the Republicans not\r\nto take it up.  Some of them thought it was likely, if passed,\r\nto have a very serious and perhaps disastrous effect on the\r\ncountry.  So far as I know, nobody in either House of Congress\r\nor in the press has pointed out why such a result would be\r\nlikely to follow.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I was very well satisfied.  The interests concerned\r\nare vast.  A rash or unskilful remedy might bring infinite\r\ntrouble or ruin to lawful business.  The work of restraining\r\nthe trusts is going on very well under the law of 1890.  It\r\nis a matter which must be discussed and considered by the\r\nAmerican people for a great many years to come, and the evils\r\nfrom the trusts at present are rather in anticipation than\r\nin reality.  So I am very well content, for the present, with\r\nwhat has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORCESTER BAR\r\n\r\nThe Worcester Bar, when I came to it, was much like a class\r\nof boys in college.  There was rivalry and sharp practice\r\nin some cases, and roughness of speech toward each other and\r\ntoward witnesses and parties.  But in the main, the lawyers\r\nstood by one another and were ready to help each other in\r\ntrouble, and the lawyer's best and most trustworthy friends\r\nwere his associates.  The Judge and the jurymen, and the lawyers\r\nfrom out of town used to come into Worcester and stay at the\r\nold Sykes or Thomas Tavern, opposite the court-house, and\r\nat another one known as the United States Hotel, further south.\r\nThe former was kept for a good many years by an old fellow\r\nnamed Sykes.  He was a singular-looking person--a large head,\r\nstout body, rather protuberant belly, and short curved legs\r\nand very long arms.  He had large heavy eyebrows, a wide mouth\r\nand a curved nose and sallow complexion looking a good deal\r\nlike the caricatures of the Jewish countenance in the comic\r\nnewspapers.  He had two sons who looked very much like him\r\nand seemed about as old as their father.  One day the three\r\nwere standing in front of his tavern when a countryman came\r\nalong who undertook to stop with his load at the front door\r\nof the tavern.  Sykes was standing there with his two sons,\r\none on each side of him.  He did not like to have the countryman\r\nstop his load in that spot and called out to him rather roughly,\r\n\"Move along.\"  The fellow surveyed the group for a moment\r\nwith an amused look and complied with the order, but shouted\r\nout to the old man:  \"Wal, this is the fust time I ever saw\r\nthree Jacks of Spades in one pack.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court sat till six o'clock and often far into the evening,\r\nand began at half-past eight or nine.  So there was no chance\r\nfor the country lawyers to go home at night.  There was great\r\nfun at these old taverns in the evening and at meal times.\r\nThey insisted generally, like Mrs. Battles in whist, on the\r\nrigor of the game, and the lawyer had to look sharp after\r\nhis pleadings or he found himself tripped up.  The parties\r\ncould not be witnesses, nor could any person interested in\r\nthe result of the trial.  So many a good case, and many a\r\ngood defence failed for want of the legal evidence to make\r\nit out.  But the whole Bar and the public seemed to take an\r\ninterest in important trials.  People came in from the country\r\nround with their covered wagons, simply for the pleasure of\r\nattending Court and seeing the champions contend with each\r\nother.  The lawyers who were not engaged in the case were\r\nalways ready to help those who were with advice and suggestion.\r\nIt used to be expected that members of the Bar would be in\r\nthe court-house hearing the trials even if they were not engaged\r\nin them.  That was always an excuse for being absent from\r\nthe office, and their clients sought them at the court-house\r\nfor consultation.  I cannot but think that the listening to\r\nthe trial and argument of causes by skilful advocates was\r\na better law school than any we have now, and that our young\r\nmen, especially in the large cities, fail to become good advocates\r\nand to learn the art of putting in a case, and of examining\r\nand cross-examining witnesses, for want of a constant and\r\nfaithful attendance on the courts.\r\n\r\nIn those old times, our old lawyers, if Charles Lamb had\r\nknown them and should paint them, would make a set of portraits\r\nas interesting as his old Benchers of the Inner Temple.  Old\r\nCalvin Willard, many years sheriff of Worcester, would have\r\ndelighted Elia.  He did not keep the wig or the queue or the\r\nsmall-clothes of our great-grandfathers, but he had their\r\nformal and ceremonial manners in perfection.  It was like\r\na great State ceremonial to meet him and shake hands with\r\nhim.  He paused for a moment, surveyed you carefully to be\r\nsure of the person, took a little time for reflection to be\r\nsure there was nothing in the act to compromise his dignity,\r\nand then slowly held out his hand.  But the grasp was a warm\r\none, and the ceremony and the hand-shake conveyed his cordial\r\nrespect and warmth of regard.  He always reminded me of the\r\nEnglishman in Crabbe's \"Tales\" who, I think, may have been\r\nhis kinsman.\r\n\r\n  The wish that Roman necks in one were found\r\n  That he who formed the wish might deal the wound,\r\n  This man had never heard.  But of the kind\r\n  Is the desire which rises in his mind.\r\n  He'd have all English hands, for further he\r\n  Cannot conceive extends our charity,\r\n  All but his own, in one right hand to grow;\r\n  And then what hearty shake would he bestow.\r\n\r\nMr. Willard was once counsel before a magistrate in a case\r\nin which he took much interest.  A rough, coarse country\r\nlawyer was on the other side.  When Willard stated some legal\r\nproposition, his adversary said:  \"I will bet you five dollars\r\nthat ain't law.\"  \"Sir,\" said Mr. Willard, drawing himself\r\nup to his full height, with the great solemnity of tone of\r\nwhich he was master:  \"Sir, I do not permit myself to make\r\nthe laws of my country the subject of a bet.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the old characters who came down to my time from\r\nthe older generation was Samuel M. Burnside.  He was a man\r\nof considerable wealth and lived in a generous fashion, dispensing\r\nan ample hospitality at his handsome mansion, still standing\r\nin Worcester.  He was a good black-letter lawyer, though without\r\nmuch gift of influencing juries or arguing questions of law\r\nto the Court.  He was a good Latin scholar, very fond of Horace\r\nand Virgil, and used to be on the committees to examine the\r\nstudents at Harvard, rather disturbing the boys with his somewhat\r\npedantic questioning.  He was very nearsighted, and, it is\r\nsaid, once seized the tail of a cow which passed near him\r\nin the street and hurried forward, supposing some woman had\r\ngone by and said, \"Madam, you are dropping your tippet.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting characters among the elders of\r\nthe Worcester Bar was old Rejoice Newton.  He was a man of\r\nexcellent judgment, wisdom, integrity and law learning enough\r\nto make him a safe guide to his clients in their important\r\ntransactions.  He was a most prosaic person, without sentiment,\r\nwithout much knowledge of literature, and absolutely without\r\nhumor.  He was born in Northfield near the banks of the Connecticut\r\nRiver and preserved to the time of his death his love of rural\r\nscenes and of farming.  He had an excellent farm a mile or\r\ntwo out of town, where he spent all the time he could get\r\nfrom his professional duties.  He was associated with Chief\r\nJustice Shaw in some important cases, and always thought that\r\nit was due to his recommendation that Governor Lincoln appointed\r\nthe Chief Justice--a suggestion which Governor Lincoln used\r\nto repel with great indignation.  The Governor was also a\r\ngood farmer, especially proud of his cattle.  Each of them\r\nliked to brag of their crops and especially of the produce\r\nof their respective dairies.  Governor Lincoln was once discoursing\r\nto Devens and me, in our office, of a wonderful cow of his\r\nwhich, beside raising an enormous calf, had produced the cream\r\nfor a great quantity of butter.  Mr. Devens said: \"Why, that\r\nbeats Major Newton's cow, that gave for months at a time some\r\nfifteen or eighteen quarts at a milking.\" \"If Brother Newton\r\nhears of my cow,\" said Governor Lincoln, \"he will at once\r\ndouble the number of quarts.\"  The old Major was quite fond\r\nof telling stories, of which the strong points were not apt\r\nto suffer in his narration.  One Fourth of July, when he had\r\ngot to be an old man, he came down street and met a brother\r\nmember of the Bar, who took him up into the room of the Worcester\r\nLight Infantry, a Company of which the Major's deceased son\r\nhad long ago been the Captain.  The members of the Company\r\nwere spending the Fourth with a bowl of punch and other refreshments.\r\nThe Major was introduced and was received with great cordiality,\r\nand my friend left him there.  The next day my friend was\r\ngoing down street and met the Captain of the Light Infantry,\r\nwho said:  \"That was a very remarkable old gentleman you brought\r\ninto our room yesterday.  He stayed there all the forenoon,\r\ndrinking punch and telling stories.  He distinctly remembered\r\nGeneral Washington.  He went home to dinner, came back after\r\ndinner, drank some more punch, and remembered Christopher\r\nColumbus.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Major was once addressing the Supreme Court and maintained\r\na doctrine which did not commend itself to Chief Justice Shaw.\r\nThe Chief Justice interposed: \"Brother Newton, what is the\r\nuse of arguing that?  We have held otherwise in such a case\r\n(citing it) and again and again since.\" The Major paused,\r\ndrew his spectacles slowly off his nose, and said to the Court\r\nwith great seriousness: \"May it please your Honors, I have\r\na great respect for the opinions of this Court, except in\r\nsome very gross cases.\"\r\n\r\nA man by the name of Lysander Spooner, whose misfortune it\r\nwas to be a good deal in advance of his age, the author of\r\na very clever pamphlet maintaining the unconstitutionality\r\nof slavery, also published some papers attacking the authenticity\r\nof Christian miracles.  In these days of Bob Ingersoll such\r\nviews would be met with entire toleration, but they shocked\r\nMajor Newton exceedingly, as they did most persons of his\r\ntime.  Spooner studied for the Bar and applied to be admitted.\r\nHe was able to pass an examination.  But the Major, as _amicus\r\ncuriae,_ addressed the Court and insisted that Spooner was\r\nnot a man of proper character, and affirmed in support of\r\nhis assertion that he was the author of some blasphemous attacks\r\non Christianity.  The result was that Spooner's application\r\nwas denied.  The Court adjourned for dinner.  It was the day\r\nof the calling of the docket, and just before the Judge came\r\nin in the afternoon, the whole Bar of Worcester County were\r\nassembled, filling the room.  The Major sat in a seat near\r\none of the doors.  He had dined pretty heavily, the day was\r\nhot and the Major was sleepy.  He tipped back a little in\r\nhis chair, his head fell back between his shoulders and his\r\nmouth opened, with his nose pointed toward the zenith.  Just\r\nthen Spooner came in.  As he passed by the Major, the temptation\r\nwas irresistible.  He seized the venerable nose of the old\r\npatriarch between his thumb and finger, and gave it a vigorous\r\ntwist.  The Major was awakened and sprang to his feet, and\r\nin a moment realized what had happened.  He was, as may be\r\nwell supposed, intensely indignant.  No Major in the militia\r\ncould submit to such an insult.  He seized his chair and hurled\r\nit at the head of the offender, but missed, and the bystanders\r\ninterposed before he was able to inflict the deserved punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Major lived to a good old age.  His mental faculties\r\nbecame somewhat impaired before he died.  He had great respect\r\nfor his excellent son-in-law, Colonel Wetherell, who was on\r\nGovernor Andrew's staff during the War, and thought that anything\r\nwhich ought to be accomplished could be accomplished by the\r\ninfluence of the Colonel.  Somebody told him during the hardest\r\npart of the war that we ought to bend all our energies to\r\nthe capture of Richmond.  If Richmond were to fall the rebellion\r\nwould be easily put down.  \"You are quite right, sir,\" said\r\nthe Major.  \"It ought to be done, and I will speak to Colonel\r\nWetherell about it.\" But everybody who knew the worthy Major,\r\nunless it were some offender against justice, or some person\r\nagainst whose wrong-doing he had been the shield and protector\r\nto a client, liked the kindly, honest and sturdy old man.\r\nHe was District Attorney for the district which included Worcester\r\nCounty--an office then and ever since held by admirable lawyers.\r\nHe prided himself on the fact that he never drew an indictment\r\nwhich was not sustained by the Court, if it were questioned.\r\nHe liked to recite his old triumphs.  He especially plumed\r\nhimself on his sagacity in dealing with one case which came\r\nbefore him.  A complaint was made of a book well known at\r\nthat time, the memoirs of a dissolute woman, which was full\r\nof indecency, but in which there could not be found a single,\r\nseparate indecent sentence or word.  The Major was at a loss\r\nfor some time what to do in indicting it.  If he set forth\r\nthe whole book, it would give it an immortality on the records\r\nof the court which perhaps would be worse for the public morals\r\nthan the original publication.  Finally he averred in the\r\nindictment that the defendant had published a book so indecent\r\nthat it was unfit to be spread on the records of the court.\r\nThe question went up to the Supreme Court and the indictment\r\nwas held good.  It was difficult for the Court or the jury\r\nto find that such a book was fit to be spread on the records\r\nof the Court, and the Major secured his victory and convicted\r\nhis criminal.\r\n\r\nOne of the bright young lawyers who came to the Bar a few\r\nyears after I did, was Appleton Dadmun.  He died of consumption\r\nafter a brief but very successful career.   He was the very\r\ntype and embodiment of the Yankee countryman in his excellencies\r\nand his defects and in his fashion of speech and behavior.\r\nHe was a graduate of Amherst College.  The only evidence I\r\never discovered of his classical education was his habit of\r\nusing the Greek double negative in ordinary English speech.\r\nHe used to employ me almost always as senior when he had a\r\ncase to argue to a jury, or an important law argument in Court.\r\nHe would put off the engagement until just as the case was\r\ncoming on.  He used to intend to try his cases himself.  But\r\nhis heart, at the last moment, would fail him.  He was as\r\nanxious about his clients' cases as if they were his own.\r\nHe was exceedingly negligent about his pleadings and negligent\r\nin the matter of being prepared with the necessary formal\r\nproofs of facts which were really not doubtful but which\r\nwere put in issue by the pleadings.  When I was retained\r\nmy first duty was to prepare an amendment of the declaration\r\nor the answer or plea, or, perhaps, to see whether he had\r\ngot the attesting witness to prove some signature.  But when\r\nwe had got past all that I used to find that he had prepared\r\nhis evidence with reference to what was the pinch of the\r\ncase of what was likely to be finally the doubtful point in\r\nthe mind of court or jury with infinite sagacity and skill.\r\nI have rarely known a better judge of the effect of evidence\r\non the mind of ordinary juries.  He took his clients into his\r\naffection as if they had been his own brethren or children,\r\nand seemed always to hate to be compelled to make any charge\r\nfor his services, however successful.\r\n\r\nHe had a pleasant wit.  On one occasion a member of the bar\r\nnamed Holbrook, who was not a bad fellow, but had, like the\r\nrest of the world, some peccadilloes to repent of, came into\r\nthe Court-house one morning just as the Court was coming in\r\nwhere the lawyers were gathered.  Much excited, he said he\r\nwas riding into Worcester in a chaise from the neighboring\r\ntown where he spent his nights in the summer.  His horse had\r\nrun away and tore at a terrible rate down Main Street, swinging\r\nthe chaise from one side to the other as he ran, and breaking\r\nsome part of the harness and perhaps one of the shafts.  But\r\nat last he had contrived to crawl out through the window behind\r\nin the chaise top and hold on to the cross-bar.  Letting himself\r\ndown just as the chaise had got to the extremity of its sway\r\nfrom one side to another, he let go and escaped without injury.\r\nBut, he said, it was a terrible five minutes.  Every action\r\nof his life seemed to rush through his memory with the swiftness\r\nof a torrent.  \"You ought to have very heavy damages, sir,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Dadmun.\r\n\r\nAnother of the brightest of the young lawyers when I came\r\nto the Bar was H.  He had, however, had rather an unfortunate\r\nintroduction to life.  His father, who was a very wealthy\r\nand prosperous manufacturer, sent him to Yale College and\r\nsupplied him liberally with money, not only for his support,\r\nbut for the indulgence of every extravagant taste.  Beside\r\nspending what his father allowed him, he incurred a good many\r\ndebts, expecting to find no difficulty in their payment.  His\r\nfather failed in business with a great crash about the end\r\nof his junior year and died suddenly.  He kept on, however,\r\non credit, until he graduated and then came out with a heavy\r\nload of debt, and no resources for studying his profession.\r\nHe got thorough, however, by dint of plausible manners.  He\r\nwas a very honest fellow in other respects, but he got the\r\nhabit of incurring debts which he could not pay.  Then he\r\ntook to drinking hard, and finally went to New York, and died\r\nafter a career of dissipation.  But everybody liked him.  Drunk\r\nor sober, he was the best company in the world, full of anecdote\r\nflavored with a shrewd and not ill-natured wit.  There was a\r\nmanufacturer in a village near Worcester who had failed in\r\nbusiness owing large debts all about.  He was a man of enormous\r\nbulk, the fattest man in the whole region round-about, weighing\r\nconsiderably over three hundred.  He left the State to avoid\r\nhis creditors, and dwelt in New York, keeping himself out\r\nof their reach.  At last it was discovered by a creditor that\r\nhe used to come to Worcester in the train which arrived from\r\nNew York on the Western Railroad shortly before midnight Saturday,\r\ngo over to his old home, which was not far off, stay there\r\nSunday, when he was exempt from arrest, and take the cars\r\nSunday night at about the same hour for New York.  Accordingly\r\nold Jonathan Day, a veteran deputy-sheriff, armed with an\r\nexecution, lay in wait for him one dark and stormy Saturday\r\nnight at the little old wooden depot of the Western Railroad,\r\nsome hundred or two feet from Grafton Street.  The train\r\ncame in, and the debtor got out.  The old General laid his\r\nhands on him, and told him he was his prisoner.  He protested\r\nand demurred and begged, making all manner of promises to\r\npay the debt if the officer would not take him to jail.  But\r\nDay was inexorable.  Meantime the train had gone on, and the\r\nkeeper of the depot had put out the lights and gone off.  There\r\nwas nobody left in the darkness but the officer and the debtor.\r\n\"Well,\" said the fellow, \"if you are going to take me to jail\r\nyou must carry me.  I won't walk.\" So he sat himself down\r\non the platform.  Day tried to persuade him to walk, and then\r\ntugged and tugged at his collar, but without the slightest\r\neffect.  He might as well have tried to move a mountain.  He\r\nwaited in a good deal of perplexity, and at last he heard\r\nthe rattle of wheels on Grafton Street, and gave a loud yell\r\nfor assistance.  The owner of the wagon came to the scene.\r\nGeneral Day demanded his help as one of the posse comitatus.\r\nBut it was as hard to the two to move the obstruction as it\r\nhad been for the old General alone.  So the General put the\r\ndebtor in charge of his new recruit, and went off up street\r\nto see what counsel he could get in the matter.  All the lights\r\nin the lawyers' offices and places of business were out except\r\na solitary gleam which came from the office of my friend\r\nH.  He was sitting up alone, soaking himself with the contents\r\nof a bottle of brandy.  General Day found him sitting there\r\nand stated his case.  My friend heard it through, took it\r\ninto consideration, and took down and consulted the Revised\r\nStatutes and the Digest.  At last he shook his head with an\r\nair of drunken gravity and said:  \"I don't find any express\r\nprovision anywhere for such a case.  So I think we must be\r\ngoverned by the rule of law for the case nearest like it we\r\ncan find.  That seems to be the case of the attachment of\r\npersonal property, such as lumber, which is too bulky to be\r\nremoved.  My advice to you is to put a placard on him saying\r\nhe is attached, and go off and leave him till Monday morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young man, one summer a few years after my admission\r\nto the Bar, I took a journey on foot with Horace Gray through\r\nBerkshire County.  We started from Greenfield and walked over\r\nthe Hoosac Mountain to Adams and Williamstown, then over the\r\nold road to Pittsfield, then to Stockbridge, Great Barrington,\r\nand the summit of Mt. Washington, now better known as Mt.\r\nEverett or Taghsomi; thence to Bashpish Falls in New York,\r\nand to the Salisbury Lakes in Connecticut.  We visited many\r\ninteresting places and enjoyed what has always seemed to me\r\nthe most beautiful scenery on earth.\r\n\r\nThere were one or two quite ludicrous adventures.  I went\r\nalone to the top of Bald Mountain in Lenox one day.  Gray\r\nhad been there and preferred to visit a neighboring hilltop.\r\nAs I approached the summit, which was a bare pasture, I came\r\nupon a powerful bull with a herd of cattle near him.  He began\r\nto bellow and paw the ground and move toward me in angry fashion.\r\nThere was no chance for any place of refuge which I could\r\nhope to gain.  I looked around for some rock or instrument\r\nof defence.  It was, I think, the most imminent danger to\r\nwhich I have ever been exposed.  I was calculating my capacity\r\nfor dodging the creature when suddenly a sound like a small\r\nclap of thunder was heard.  The rest of the herd, which seemed\r\nquite wild, seeing the approach of a stranger, had taken alarm\r\nand started off down the hillside on a full run, their rushing\r\nand trampling causing the earth to reverberate beneath their\r\ntread and produce the sound of which I have just spoken.\r\nThe old bull hearing the sound and seeing his companions\r\ndeparting concluded he would follow their example.  He turned\r\ntail too, and retreated down the mountain side, much to my\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nOn our walk through Lanesboro we stopped at a plain country\r\ntavern to get lunch.  There were several codgers such as in\r\nthose days used to haunt country bar-rooms about eleven o'clock\r\nin the morning and four o'clock in the afternoon.  Sitting\r\nin an old wooden chair tilted back against the wall of the\r\nroom was one of them curled up with his knees sticking up\r\nhigher than his head.  He looked at Gray's stately proportions\r\nand called out:  \"How tall are you?\" Gray, who was always\r\nrather careful of his dignity, made some brief answer not\r\nintended to encourage familiarity.  But the fellow persisted:\r\n\"I would like to measure with you.\" Gray concluded it was\r\nbest to enter into the humor of the occasion.  So he stood\r\nup against the wall.  The other man proceeded to draw himself\r\nup out of the chair, and unroll, and unroll, and unroll until\r\nat last his gigantic stature reached up almost as high as\r\nGray's.  But he fell short a little.  I learned, later, that\r\nit was a man named Shaw who afterward became famous as a writer\r\nand humorist under the pseudonym of Josh Billings.  He was\r\nthe son of Henry Shaw, formerly of Lanesboro; at that time\r\na millionaire dwelling in New York, and known to fame as\r\none of the two Massachusetts Representatives who voted for\r\nthe Missouri Compromise in 1820.  Henry Shaw was, I believe,\r\na native of Lanesboro, and had represented the Berkshire district\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nThe person whom the Worcester lawyers of this time like best\r\nto remember was Peter C. Bacon.  He was the Dominie Sampson\r\nof the Worcester Bar.  I suppose he was the most learned man\r\nwe ever had in Worcester, and probably, in Massachusetts.\r\nHe was simple and guileless as a child; of a most inflexible\r\nhonesty, devoted to the interest of his clients, and an enthusiastic\r\nlover of the science of the law.  When, in rare cases, he\r\nthoroughly believed in the righteousness of his case, he was\r\nirresistible.  But in general he was full of doubts and hesitation.\r\nHe was, until he was compelled to make his arguments more\r\ncompact by the rules of court limiting the time of arguments,\r\nrather tedious.  He liked to go out into side-paths and to\r\ndiscourse of matters not material to the issue but suggested\r\nto him as he went along.  He had a curious fashion of using\r\nthe ancient nomenclature of the Common law where it had passed\r\nout of the knowledge even of most lawyers and the comprehension\r\nof common men.  He would begin his appeal to the jury in some\r\ncase where a fraud had been attempted on his client, by saying,\r\n\"Gentlemen, the law abhorreth covin.\" He was a lawyer everywhere.\r\nHis world was the Court-house and his office.  I met him in\r\nthe street, of a Sunday noon, one summer and said to him,\r\n\"Why, Brother Bacon, you must have had a long sermon to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Mr. Bacon said, \"I stayed to the Sunday-school.  I have\r\na class of young girls.  It's very interesting.  I've got\r\n'em as far as the Roman Civil Law.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bacon could seldom be made angry by any incivility to\r\nhimself.  But he resented any attempt to deprive a client,\r\nhowever much of a n'er-do-well he might be, of all the rights\r\nand forms of a legal trial.  He was also much disturbed if\r\nany lawyer opposed to him misstated a principle of law, who\r\nought, in his judgment, to know better.  I was once trying\r\na case against him and his partner, Judge Aldrich, where General\r\nDevens was my associate.  Devens was summing up the case,\r\nand complaining of the conduct of some parties interested\r\nin the estate of a deceased person.  One of them was a son\r\nof a deceased niece.  There being no children, under our law,\r\nthe nephews and nieces inherit, but not the children of deceased\r\nnephews or nieces, when there are living nephews or nieces.\r\nGeneral Devens, not having in his mind the legal provision\r\nat the moment, said to the jury: \"The sound of the earth on\r\nthe coffin of the old lady had scarcely ceased when one of\r\nthese heirs hurried to the probate office to get administration.\"\r\nMr. Bacon rose and interrupted him with great emotion.  \"He\r\nis not an heir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said,\" Mr. Devens repeated, \"one of these heirs, Mr.\r\nA. F.\"\r\n\r\nBacon burst into tears and said again, with a broken voice:\r\n\"He is not an heir, I say, he is not an heir.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the point and whispered to Devens:  \"An assumed heir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" Devens said, \"an assumed heir, if my friend likes\r\nit better.\"  Bacon replied with a \"Humph\" of contentment and\r\nsatisfaction, and the matter subsided.  As I was walking home\r\nfrom the court-house with Mr. Bacon afterward I expressed\r\nmy regret at the occurrence and told him that General Devens\r\nhad the greatest respect for him.  Mr. Bacon replied: \"He\r\nhad no business to say it.  Aldrich told me to tell him he\r\nhad not read the 'Revised Statutes.' But I would not say such\r\na thing as that, sir, about any man.\"\r\n\r\nBut Brother Bacon had the kindliest of hearts.  It was impossible\r\nfor him to bear malice or retain resentment against anybody.\r\nWhen I was a youngster I was once in a case where Bacon was\r\non the other side.  Charles Allen was my associate.  It was\r\na case which excited great public feeling.  There were throngs\r\nof witnesses.  It was tried in the middle of the terrific\r\nheats of one of the hottest summers ever known in Worcester.\r\nAllen, who had a power of stinging sarcasm which he much delighted\r\nto use, kept Bacon nervous and angry through the whole trial.\r\nAt last, one afternoon, Bacon lost his patience.  When the\r\nCourt adjourned, he stood up on a little flight of steps on\r\nthe outside of the Court-house and addressed the crowd, who\r\nwere going out.  He said: \"Charles Allen has abused me all\r\nthrough this trial.  He is always abusing me.  He has abused\r\nme ever since I came to this Bar.  I have said it before and\r\nI will say it again--_he is a curious kind of a man.\"_ This\r\nutterance relieved Brother Bacon's wounded feelings and he\r\nnever probably thought of the matter again.\r\n\r\nOne of the great events in Bacon's life was his receiving\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Laws from Brown University, where\r\nhe was graduated.  This gave infinite satisfaction to his\r\nbrethren of the Bar, who were all very fond of him.  It was\r\nat once proposed, after the old Yankee fashion in the country\r\nwhen a man got a new hat or a new suit of clothes, that we\r\nshould all go down to T.'s to \"wet\" it.  T. was the proprietor\r\nof a house a few miles from Worcester, famous for cooking\r\ngame and trout in the season, and not famous for a strict\r\nobservance of the laws against the sale of liquor.  There\r\nwas a good deal of feeling about that among the temperance\r\npeople of the town, although it was a most excellent, properly\r\nkept house in all other respects.  But the prejudice against\r\nit of the strict teetotalers had occasioned some entirely\r\nunfounded scandal about its management in other matters.  Mr.\r\nBacon, when invited by the Bar to go as a guest, accepted\r\nthe invitation, but stipulated that he should have provided\r\nfor him a pint bottle of English ale.  He said he was opposed,\r\non principle, to drinking intoxicating liquors, but his doctors\r\nhad ordered that he should drink a pint of ale every day with\r\nhis dinner.  That was provided.  The Bar sat down to dinner\r\nat an early hour and the fun and frolic were kept up far into\r\nthe small hours of the night.  Brother Bacon was the subject\r\nof every speech and of every toast.  He seemed to think it\r\nwas necessary for him to reply to every speaker and toast.\r\nSo he was kept on his legs a great part of the night.  As\r\nhe sipped his modest tumbler of ale, Brother Dewey, who sat\r\nnext to him, would replenish it, when Mr. Bacon was not looking,\r\nfrom a bottle of champagne.  So at least two quart bottles\r\nof champagne were passed into the unsuspecting Brother Bacon\r\nthrough that single pint of beer.  When we broke up, the host\r\ncame to ask us how we had enjoyed ourselves, and Mr. Bacon\r\ntold him he would like to know where he got his English ale,\r\nwhich he thought was the best he had ever tasted in his life.\r\nIt is the only instance that I know of in modern times of\r\nthe repetition of the miracle of the widow's cruse.\r\n\r\nJudge Thomas, then holding the Supreme Court at Worcester,\r\nwanted very much indeed to go down with the Bar, but he thought\r\nit would not quite do.  The next morning, Mr. Bacon had to\r\ntry a libel for adultery between two parties living in the\r\ntown where the Bar had had their supper.  He had had no chance\r\nto see his witnesses, who got into town just as the Court\r\nopened.  So he had to put them on and examine them at a venture.\r\nThe first one he called was a grave-looking citizen.  Mr.\r\nBacon asked him a good many questions, but could get no answer\r\nwhich tended to help his case, and at last he said, with some\r\nimpatience:  \"Mr. Witness, can you tell me any single fact\r\nwhich tends to show that his man has committed adultery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all I know about it, Squire Bacon,\" replied the witness,\r\n\"is that he's been seen at Charlie T.'s\"--the inn where Bacon\r\nhad had his supper the night before.  There was an immense\r\nroar of laughter from the Bar, led by Judge Thomas, the ring\r\nof whose laugh could have been heard half way across the square.\r\n\r\nBrother Bacon, though a modest and most kindly man, used to\r\nthink he had a monopoly of the abstruser knowledge in regard\r\nto real property and real actions.  It used sometimes to provoke\r\nhim when he found a competent antagonist in cases involving\r\nsuch questions.  There was a suit in which Bacon was for the\r\ndemandant where a creditor had undertaken to levy an execution\r\nof property standing in a wife's name but claimed to have\r\nbeen conveyed to her in trust for the husband on consideration\r\npaid by him.  In such cases, under the Massachusetts law,\r\nthe land may be levied upon as the property of the debtor,\r\nnotwithstanding the ostensible title is in another.  The wife\r\ncontested the facts.  But after the bringing of the suit,\r\nthe wife died, and the husband by her death became tenant\r\nby the courtesy.  Of course his title as tenant by the courtesy\r\nwas unaffected by the previous levy, and his wife's right\r\nto contest the demand devolved upon him.  The husband and\r\nwife had both been made parties defendant to the suit under\r\nthe Massachusetts practice.  It would not do to let the creditor\r\nget judgment.  Under the advice of Mr. Nelson, afterward\r\nJudge, one of the most learned and careful lawyers, the defendant\r\npleaded a special non-tenure, and the case was reported to\r\nthe full bench of the Supreme Court, where Mr. Bacon was\r\nemployed for the plaintiff.  The report inaccurately said\r\nthat the defendant filed a disclaimer.  Mr. Bacon made a\r\nvery learned argument to show that upon the facts the disclaimer\r\ncould not be supported, and was going on swimmingly, under\r\nfull sail.  Mr. Bacon said in his argument:  \"If he had pleaded\r\nnon-tenure, I admit, your Honors, he would have been pretty\r\nwell off.\"  Whereupon Judge Hoar sent for the original papers,\r\nand looking at them read the plea, and said: \"Isn't that a\r\nplea of non-tenure?\"  Mr. Bacon was obliged to admit that\r\nit was.  The Chief Justice said:  \"Well, then, the tenant\r\nis in the condition which you describe as being pretty well\r\noff, isn't he, Brother Bacon?\"  Bacon answered with an angry\r\nand impatient \"Humph.\"  The Chief Justice said: \"Are there\r\nany other objections to the plea, Brother Bacon?\" \"More than\r\nforty, your Honor,\" replied Bacon indignantly, \"which I should\r\nstate to you at a proper time.\" The Chief Justice said that\r\nthat seemed to be the proper time.  But Mr. Bacon sat down\r\nin high dudgeon, without further remark.\r\n\r\nHe was the kindliest of men, both to man and beast.  I once\r\nwas at a country tavern where Bacon and I were to dine.  It\r\nwas about the time of the session of the Supreme Court.  I\r\nwas sitting on the veranda of the hotel waiting for dinner\r\nto be ready, in the summer afternoon.  Mr. Bacon took a little\r\nwalk, and as he came along and was passing the porch, a puppy\r\nran after him, came up behind, and seized his pantaloons in\r\nhis teeth, making quite a rent in them.  Bacon looked round\r\nand saw the mischief, and shook his finger at the poor dog.\r\nI am sure he had no idea that anybody of the human species\r\nwas within hearing.  The animal crouched down in great terror,\r\nexpecting a beating.  Mr. Bacon paused a moment with his\r\nuplifted finger, and addressed the cur.  \"Why do you try to\r\nbite me?  Why do you tear my pantaloons? Do you think I can\r\ngo through the Supreme Court without pantaloons?\" With that\r\nhe left the poor dog to the reproaches of his own conscience\r\nand took no further notice of the transaction.\r\n\r\nI ought perhaps, as I have told this story at Brother Bacon's\r\nexpense, to tell one at my own where he came out decidedly\r\nahead.  We were opposed in a real estate case where the other\r\nevidence of the title was pretty strong Bacon's way, but the\r\nancient bounds seemed to agree with my client's theory.  I\r\naddressed the jury with all the earnestness in my power in\r\nfavor of the importance of maintaining the ancient landmarks,\r\nquoting the curse of the Scripture on him that removed them,\r\nand endeavored to make them see how much of the safety and\r\nsecurity of property depended on sticking to them in spite\r\nof any amount of fallible human testimony.  I thought I had\r\nmade a good impression.  When Brother Bacon came to reply,\r\nhe told the jury about the Roman god Terminus who watched\r\nover boundaries, and after quite an eloquent description,\r\nhe told the jury: \"Brother Hoar always seems to me when he\r\nmakes this argument, which I have heard a good many times\r\nbefore, to think he is the god Terminus, and that the protection\r\nof all our modern landmarks is in his exclusive province.\"\r\nThe jury were very much amused.  I have forgotten how the\r\ncase was decided.  But I should doubtless remember if it had\r\nbeen decided in my favor.\r\n\r\nQuite late in life some of Mr. Bacon's clients, seeing that\r\nhe was out of health, and grateful for his long, faithful and\r\npoorly paid service, made an arrangement to send him on a\r\njourney to Europe.  He was gone a little more than a year,\r\nvisiting England, France, Italy and Spain, and returning\r\nwith new vigor for another ten years of hard work.  His interest\r\nin Europe had come chiefly from the literature which he had\r\nread in his younger days.  He was not very familiar with much\r\nEnglish prose or poetry later than the time of Addison.  In\r\none of his first letters in London he announced with great\r\nsatisfaction, \"I have a room not far from the celebrated Westminster\r\nAbbey mentioned in the _Spectator.\"_\r\n\r\nBut Brother Bacon ought not to be remembered alone, or chiefly,\r\nfor his eccentricities.  He was a profound, accurate and able\r\njurist.  The great interests of clients were safe with him.\r\nTo him the profession of the lawyer was a sacred office.  I\r\nnever think of him without recalling Cicero's beautiful description\r\nin the \"De Oratore\" of the old age of the great lawyer:\r\n\r\nQuit est enim praeclarius quam honoribus et republicae muneribus\r\nperfunctum senem posee suo jure dicere id quot apud Enium\r\ndicit ille Pythias Apollo, se esse eum, unde sibi, si no populi\r\net reges, at onmnes sui cives consilium expetant;\r\n\r\n  suarum rerum incerti quos ego ope mea ex\r\n  incertis certos compotesque consili dimitto\r\n  ut ne res temere tractent turbidas.\r\n\r\nEst enim sine dubio domus jurisconsulti totius oraculum civitatis.\r\n\r\nMr. Bacon lived to celebrate his golden wedding, and ended\r\na stainless and honored life in a ripe old age, mourned by\r\nthe whole community, of which he had been a pillar and an\r\nornament.  His portrait hangs in the Court House where he\r\nwould have loved best to be remembered.\r\n\r\nIn my early days at the Worcester Bar there were a good many\r\nbright men, young and old, who had their offices in the country\r\ntowns, but who tried a good many cases before juries.  All\r\nthe courts for the county in those days were held in Worcester.\r\nAmong these country lawyers was old Nat Wood of Fitchburg,\r\nnow a fine city; then a thriving country town.  Mr. Wood\r\nhad a great gift of story-telling, and he understood very\r\nwell the character and ways of country farmers.  He used to\r\ncome down from Fitchburg at the beginning of the week, stop\r\nat the old Sykes Tavern where the jurymen and witnesses put\r\nup, spend the evening in the bar-room getting acquainted with\r\nthe jurymen and telling them stories.  So when he had a case\r\nto try, he was apt to have a very friendly tribunal.  His\r\nenemies used to say that he always contrived to sleep with\r\none juryman himself, and have his client sleep with another,\r\nwhen he had a case coming on.  He was quite irritable and\r\nhasty, and would sometimes break out with great indignation\r\nat some fancied impropriety of the other side, without fully\r\nunderstanding what was going on.  I was once examining a witness\r\nwho had led rather a roving and vagabond life.  I asked him\r\nwhere he had lived and he named seven different towns in\r\neach of which he had dwelt within a very short time.  I observed:\r\n\"Seven mighty cities claimed great Homer dead.\" Wood instantly\r\nsprang to his feet with great indignation.  \"Brother Hoar,\r\nI wish you would not put words into the witness's mouth.\"\r\n\r\nWood was a native of Stirling, a thinly settled country town\r\nnear the foot of Mount Wachusett.  The people of that town\r\nwere nearly equally divided between the Unitarian and Universalist\r\ncongregations.  Each had its meeting house fronting on the\r\npublic common or Green, as it was called.  In the summer the\r\nfarmers would come to meeting from distant parts of the town,\r\nbringing luncheon with them; have a short intermission after\r\nthe morning service, and then have a second service in the\r\nafternoon.  During the recess, in pleasant summer weather,\r\nthe men of the two congregations would gather together on\r\nthe Green, discussing the news of the town, and very often\r\ngetting into theological controversies.  In the winter, they\r\ngathered in the tavern or post-office in the same way.  There\r\nwas one Universalist champion who told the gathering that he\r\nwould make any man admit the truth of Universalism in five\r\nminutes.  He was a well known and doughty champion, and the\r\nUnitarians were rather loth to tackle him.  But, one Sunday,\r\nLawyer Wood came home to spend the day at his birthplace,\r\nand the Unitarians thought it was a good chance to encounter\r\nthe Universalist champion.  So they accepted his challenge\r\nand put Wood forward to meet him.\r\n\r\nThe Universalist theologian began:  \"You'll admit there is\r\na God?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'll be damned if I do,\" replied Wood.\r\n\r\nThe fellow was completely non-plussed.  He had got to take\r\nup his five minutes in compelling Wood to admit the existence\r\nof a Creator.  So he was obliged to retire from the field\r\ndiscomfited.\r\n\r\nAnother of our leaders at the Bar was Henry Chapin.  He had\r\nmade his way from a rather humble place in life to be one\r\nof the leaders of a very able Bar, Mayor of Worcester, and\r\nto hold a place of large influence in the various business,\r\nsocial, charitable and religious activities of the community.\r\nHe was not specially learned, specially profound or specially\r\neloquent.  But he had a rare gift of seizing upon the thought\r\nwhich was uppermost in the minds of excellent and sensible\r\nmen, country farmers, skilled workmen in the shops, business\r\nmen, expressing it in a clear and vigorous way, always agreeing\r\nwith the best sentiment of the people.  This, with an unfailing\r\ncourtesy and pleasant humor and integrity of character and\r\nlife gave him great popularity.  He was exceedingly happy\r\nin short speeches at dinners or at political meetings.  He\r\nhad a fund of entertaining anecdote which never seemed to\r\nfail.  He was very careful not to seem dogmatic, or to assert\r\nhimself too strongly.  He would put forward his opinion with\r\nsaying, \"It strikes my mind,\" or \"It has occurred to me,\"\r\nor \"I thought perhaps it was possible,\" or \"It is my impression.\"\r\nI remember once protesting before old Judge Byington against\r\nsome objection which the counsel on the other side had made\r\nto a witness testifying to his impressions.  I told the Judge\r\nthat Brother Chapin never in his life stated anything more\r\nstrongly.  If you asked him if he were married, he would\r\nsay it was his impression he was.  The Judge said:  \"Well,\r\nwe have a lawyer in Berkshire County who has the same habit.\r\nOnly if you ask him if he is married it is his impression\r\nhe isn't.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that when he went to see the Siamese Twins, he\r\nobserved to the exhibitor, \"Brothers, I suppose.\"  But I\r\nbelieve that story had been told before of one of the Royal\r\nDukes.\r\n\r\nMr. Chapin was nominated by the Republicans for Congress and\r\naccepted and would have had a useful and distinguished public\r\nlife.  But he became alarmed by the opposition of the Know-\r\nNothings and withdrew from the canvass much to the dissatisfaction\r\nof his political friends.  That ended his political aspirations.\r\nBut he was soon after appointed to the more congenial office\r\nof Judge of Probate, which he discharged to great public satisfaction\r\nuntil his lamented death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\nSOME JUDGES I HAVE KNOWN\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the most important character in the legal\r\nhistory of Massachusetts is Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw.  He\r\nwas a great lawyer before he came to the Bench.  He had written\r\none or two very able articles for the _North American Review,_\r\none of them a vigorous statement of the opinion of Massachusetts\r\nupon slavery.  He was the author of a petition signed by many\r\nof the leading men of Massachusetts in opposition to the high\r\ntariff of 1828.  No more powerful statement of the argument\r\nagainst high protection can be found.  I have been surprised\r\nthat the modern free-traders have not long ago discovered\r\nit, and brought it to light.  He was one of the managers of\r\nthe impeachment of Judge Prescott, securing a conviction against\r\na powerful array of counsel for the defendant, which included\r\nDaniel Webster.  He was consulted in difficult and important\r\nmatters by eminent counsel in other counties than Suffolk.\r\n\r\nBut all these titles to distinction have been forgotten in\r\nhis great service as Chief Justice of Massachusetts for thirty\r\nyears.  No other judicial fame in the country can rival his,\r\nwith the single exception of Marshall.  He was induced to\r\nundertake the office of Chief Justice very reluctantly, by\r\nthe strong personal urgency of Mr. Webster.  Mr. Webster\r\nused to give a humorous account of the difficulty he had in\r\novercoming the morbid scruples of the great simple-hearted\r\nintellectual giant.  He found Mr. Shaw in his office in a\r\ncloud of tobacco-smoke.  Mr. Webster did not himself smoke,\r\nand was at some disadvantage during the interview for that\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw was rather short in stature and, in the latter part\r\nof his life, somewhat corpulent.  He had a massive head, a\r\nlow forehead, and strong and rather coarse features.  He reminded\r\nyou of the statues of Gog and Magog in the Guildhall in London.\r\nHis hair came down over his forehead, and when he had been\r\naway from home for a week or two, so that his head got no combing\r\nbut his own, it was in a sadly tangled mass.  His eye was\r\ndull, except when it kindled in discussion, or when he was\r\nstirred to some utterance of grave displeasure.\r\n\r\nThere is an anecdote of Mr. Choate which occasionally goes\r\nthe rounds of the papers, and which is often repeated quite\r\ninaccurately.  The true version is this.  I heard it within\r\na few hours after it happened, and have heard it at first\r\nhand more than once since.\r\n\r\nMr. Choate was sitting next to Judge Hoar in the bar when\r\nthe Chief Justice was presiding, and the Suffolk docket was\r\nbeing called.  The Chief Justice said something which led\r\nMr. Choate to make a half-humorous and half-displeased remark\r\nabout Shaw's roughness of look and manner, to which Judge\r\nHoar replied:  \"After all, I feel a reverence for the old\r\nChief Justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"A reverence for him, my dear fellow?\" said Choate.  \"So do\r\nI.  I bow down to him as the wild Indian does before his wooden\r\nidol.  I know he's ugly; but I bow to a superior intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Shaw's mind moved very slowly.  When a case was argued,\r\nit took him a good while to get the statement of facts into\r\nhis mind.  It was hard for him to deal readily with unimportant\r\nmatters, or with things which, to other people, were matters\r\nof course.  If the simplest motion were made, he had to unlimber\r\nthe heavy artillery of his mind, go down to the roots of the\r\nquestion, consider the matter in all possible relations, and\r\ndeal with it as if he were besieging a fortress.  When he\r\nwas intent upon a subject, he was exceedingly impatient of\r\nanything that interrupted the current of his thought.  So\r\nhe was a hard person for young advocates, or for any other\r\nunless he were strong, self-possessed, and had the respect\r\nof the Judge.  My old friend and partner, Judge Washburn,\r\nonce told me that he dreaded the Law term of the Court as\r\nit approached, and sometimes felt that he would rather lay\r\nhis head down on the rail, and let a train of cars pass over\r\nit, than argue a case before Shaw.  The old man was probably\r\nunconscious of this failing.  He had the kindest heart in\r\nthe world, was extremely fond of little children and beautiful\r\nyoung women, and especially desirous to care for the rights\r\nof persons who were feeble and defenceless.\r\n\r\nI was myself counsel before him in a case where the question\r\nwas whether a heifer calf, worth six or seven dollars, the\r\noffspring of the one cow which our law reserves to a poor\r\ndebtor against attachment, was also exempt.  My opponent undertook\r\nto make some merriment about the question, and there was some\r\nlaughter at the Bar.  The old Chief Justice interposed with\r\ngreat emotion:  \"Gentlemen, remember that this is a matter\r\nof great interest to a great many poor families.\" There was\r\nno laughter after that, and that heifer calf did duty in many\r\na trial afterward, when the young advocates at the Worcester\r\nBar had some poor client to defend.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice had not the slightest sense of humor.  When\r\nold Judge Wilde, the great real property Judge, died after\r\nan illustrious judicial service of thirty-five years, somebody\r\nshowed Chief Justice Shaw a register published in Boston which\r\nrecorded his death, \"Died in Boston, the Honorable Samuel\r\nS. Wilde, aged eighty, many years Justice of the Peace.\" It\r\nwas passed up to the Bench.  The old Chief Justice looked\r\nat it, read it over again, and said \"What publication is this?\"\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when the lawyers and Judges spent the evenings\r\nof Court week at the taverns on the Circuit, the Chief Justice\r\nliked to get a company of lawyers about him and discourse\r\nto them.  He was very well informed, indeed, on a great variety\r\nof matters, and his talk was very interesting and full of\r\ninstruction.  But there was no fun in it.  One evening he\r\nwas discoursing in his ponderous way about the vitality of\r\nseed.  He said:  \"I understand that they found some seed of\r\nwheat in one of the pyramids of Egypt, wrapped up in a mummy-\r\ncase, where it had been probably some four thousand years\r\nat least, carried it over to England last year and planted\r\nit, and it came up and they had a very good crop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of mummies, sir?\" inquired old Josiah Adams, a waggish member\r\nof the Bar.\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Adams,\" replied the Chief Justice, with a tone of\r\nreproof, and with great seriousness.  \"No, Mr. Adams, not\r\nmummies--wheat.\"\r\n\r\nAdams retired from the circle in great discomfiture.  He\r\ninquired of one of the other lawyers, afterward, if he supposed\r\nthat the Chief Justice really believed that he thought the\r\nseed had produced mummies, and was told by his friend that\r\nhe did not think there was the slightest doubt of it.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Shaw, though very rough in his manner was exceedingly\r\nconsiderate of the rights of poor and friendless persons.\r\nSometimes persons unacquainted with the ways of the world\r\nwould desire to make their own arguments, or would in some\r\nway interrupt the business of the court.  The Chief Justice\r\ncommonly treated them with great consideration.  One amusing\r\nincident happened quite late in his life.  A rather dissipated\r\nlawyer who had a case approaching on the docket, one day told\r\nhis office-boy to \"Go over to the Supreme Court and see what\r\nin hell they are doing.\" The Court were hearing a very important\r\ncase in which Mr. Choate was on one side and Mr. Curtis\r\non the other.  The Bar and the Court-Room were crowded with\r\nlisteners.  As Mr. Curtis was in the midst of his argument,\r\nthe eye of the Chief Justice caught sight of a young urchin,\r\nten or eleven years old, with yellow trousers stuffed into\r\nhis boots, and with his cap on one side of his head, gazing\r\nintently up at him.  He said, \"Stop a moment, Mr. Curtis.\"\r\nMr. Curtis stopped, and there was a profound silence as the\r\naudience saw the audacious little fellow standing entirely\r\nunconcerned.  \"What do you want, my boy?\" said the Chief Justice.\r\n\"Mr. P. told me to come over here and see what in hell you\r\nwas up to,\" was the reply.  There was a dive at the unhappy\r\nyouth by three or four of the deputies in attendance, and\r\na roar of laughter from the audience.  The boy was ejected.\r\nBut the gravity of the old Chief Justice was not disturbed.\r\n\r\nHe had a curiously awkward motion, especially in moving about\r\na parlor in social gatherings, or walking in the street.\r\nI once pointed out to a friend a ludicrous resemblance between\r\nhis countenance and expression and that of one of the tortoises\r\nin the illustrations of one of Agassiz's works on natural\r\nhistory.  To which my friend replied:  \"It is the tortoise\r\non which the elephant stands that bears up the foundations\r\nof the world,\" alluding to the Hindoo mythology.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Shaw's opinions, as we have them in the reports,\r\nare exceedingly diffuse.  That practice would not answer for\r\na generation which has to consult the reports of forty-five\r\nStates and of the Supreme Court and nine judicial circuits\r\nof the United States, besides the reports of the decisions\r\nof some of the District Judges, and in most cases the English\r\ndecisions.  But it would be a great public loss if any of\r\nChief Justice Shaw's utterances were omitted.  His impulse,\r\nwhen a question was argued before him, was to write a treatise\r\non the subject.  So his decisions in cases where the questions\r\nraised are narrow and unimportant are often most valuable\r\ncontributions to jurisprudence.  He seldom passed over any\r\npoint or suggestion without remark.  He went to the bottom\r\nof the case with great patience and incredible industry.  The\r\ncounsel who lost his case felt not only that he had had the\r\nopinion of a great and just magistrate, but that every consideration\r\nhe could urge for his client was respectfully treated and\r\neither yielded to or answered.  Some of his ablest and most\r\nfar-reaching decisions were written after he was eighty years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nHe possessed, beyond any other American Judge, save Marshall,\r\nwhat may be termed the statesmanship of jurisprudence.  He\r\nnever undertook to make law upon the Bench, but he perceived\r\nwith a far-sighted vision what rule of law was likely to operate\r\nbeneficially or hurtfully to the Republic.  He was watchful\r\nto lay down no doctrine which would not stand this test.  His\r\ngreat judgments stand among our great securities, like the\r\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice was a tower of strength to the Massachusetts\r\njudiciary.  But for him it is not unlikely that the State\r\nwould have adopted an elective judiciary or a tenure limited\r\nto a term of years.  But the whole people felt that his great\r\nintegrity and wisdom gave an added security to every man's\r\nlife, liberty, and property.  So the proposition to limit\r\nthe judicial tenure, although espoused by the two parties\r\nwho together made up a large majority of the people of the\r\nState, was defeated when it was submitted to a popular vote.\r\nIt is, however, a little remarkable that in the neighboring\r\nState of Vermont, for many years the Judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt were annually elected by the Legislature, a system which,\r\nI believe, has worked on the whole to their satisfaction.\r\nThey have had an able judiciary.  It is said that old Chief\r\nJustice Shaw was one evening discoursing at a meeting of the\r\nBoston Law Club to an eminent Vermont Judge, who was a guest.\r\nHe said, \"With your brief judicial tenure, sir--\"  The Vermonter\r\ninterrupted him and said, \"Why, our tenure of office is longer\r\nthan yours.\"  \"What do you mean?\" said the Chief Justice.\r\n\"I do not understand you.\"  \"Why,\" was the reply, \"our Judges\r\nare elected for a year, and you are appointed as long as you\r\nbehave yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nChief Justice Shaw is said to have been a very dull child.\r\nThe earliest indication of his gift of the masterly and unerring\r\njudgment which discerned the truth and reason of things was,\r\nhowever, noticed when he was a very small boy.  His mother\r\none day had a company at tea.  Some hot buttered toast was\r\non the table.  When it was passed to little Lemuel he pulled\r\nout the bottom slice, which was kept hot by the hot plate\r\nbeneath and the pile of toast above.  His mother reproached\r\nhim quite sharply.  \"You must not do that, Lemuel.  Suppose\r\neverybody were to do that?\"  \"Then everybody would get a bottom\r\nslice,\" answered the wise urchin.\r\n\r\nJudge Shaw had the sturdy spirit and temper of the old seafaring\r\npeople of Cape Cod, among whom he was born and bred.  He was\r\nfond of stories of the sea and of ships.  He liked to hear\r\nof bold and adventurous voyages.  Judge Gray used to tell\r\nthe story of the old Chief's standing with his back to the\r\nfire, with his coat-tails under his arm, in the Judges' room\r\nat the Suffolk Court-House, one cold winter morning, when\r\nthe news of the fate of Sir John Franklin's expedition or\r\nthe story of some other Arctic tragedy had just reached Boston\r\nand was in the morning papers.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, sir,\" said Judge Bigelow, \"that there will be no\r\nmore of these voyages to discover the North Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want 'em to find that open Polar sea, sir,\" said Shaw.\r\n\r\n\"But don't you think,\" said Judge Bigelow, \"that it is too\r\nbad to risk so many human lives, and to compel the sailors\r\nto encounter the terrible suffering and danger of these Arctic\r\nvoyages?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they'll find it yet, sir,\" was all the reply Bigelow\r\ncould get.\r\n\r\nJudge Shaw, in his latter days, was reverenced by the people\r\nof Massachusetts as if he were a demi-god.  But in his native\r\ncounty of Barnstaple he was reverenced as a God.  One winter,\r\nwhen the Supreme Court held a special session at Barnstaple\r\nfor the trial of a capital case, Judge Merrick, who was one\r\nof the Judges, came out of the Court-house just at nightfall,\r\nwhen the whole surface of the earth was covered with ice and\r\nslush, slipped and fell heavily, breaking three of his ribs.\r\nHe was taken up and carried to his room at the hotel, and\r\nlay on the sofa waiting for the doctor to come.  While the\r\nJudge lay, groaning and in agony, the old janitor of the court-\r\nhouse, who had helped pick him up, wiped off the wet from\r\nhis clothes and said to him, \"Judge Merrick, how thankful\r\nyou must be it was not the Chief Justice!\" Poor Merrick could\r\nnot help laughing, though his broken ribs were lacerating\r\nhis flesh.\r\n\r\nNext to Chief Justice Shaw in public esteem, when I came\r\nto the Bar in December, 1849, was Mr. Justice Wilde.  He\r\nwas nearly eighty years old, and began to show some signs\r\nof failing powers.  But those signs do not appear in his\r\nrecorded opinions.  He was a type of the old common-lawyer\r\nin appearance and manner and character.  He would have been\r\na fit associate for Lord Coke, and would never have given\r\nway to him.  I suppose he was never excelled as a real-property\r\nlawyer in this country.  He had the antiquated pronunciation\r\nof the last century, a venerable gray head and wrinkled countenance,\r\nwith heavy gray eyebrows.  He seemed to the general public\r\nto be nothing but a walking abridgment.  Still, he was a very\r\nwell-informed man, and had represented a district of what\r\nis now the State of Maine in Congress with great distinction.\r\nA friend of mine went rather late to church at King's Chapel\r\none Sunday when the congregation had got some way in the service,\r\nand was shown into the pew immediately in front of old Judge\r\nWilde.  The Judge was just uttering in a distinct, clear tone,\r\n\"Lord, teach me Thy statoots.\" It was the only petition he\r\nneeded to have granted to make him a complete Judge.  Of\r\nthe Lord's common law he was a thorough master.\r\n\r\nHe was no respecter of persons.  He delivered his judgments\r\nwith an unmoved air, as if he had footed up a column of figures\r\nand were announcing the result.  When I was in the Law School,\r\nMr. Webster was retained to argue an important real estate\r\ncase before Judge Wilde in Suffolk County.  Mr. Webster was\r\nmaking what would have been a powerful argument on a question\r\nof land-title but for a statute passed since the days of his\r\nconstant practice, which had not come to his knowledge.  There\r\nwas a great audience, and when Mr. Webster had got his point\r\nfairly stated, he was interrupted by Wilde.  \"Pooh, pooh,\r\nMr. Webster.\" The Judge pointed out that Webster had overlooked\r\none link in the chain of his antagonist's title.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mr. Webster in reply, \"the descent tolls the\r\nentry.\"\r\n\r\n\"That rule is abolished by the statoot, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me that?\" said Webster angrily to his\r\njunior.\r\n\r\nAnother of our great old Judges was Judge Fletcher.  He had\r\nhad a great practice as an advocate in Boston, especially\r\nas a commercial lawyer.  He had a great power of clear statement.\r\nHe brought out his utterances in a queer, jerking fashion,\r\nprotruding his lips a little as he hesitated at the beginning\r\nof his sentences.  But he knew how to convey his meaning to\r\nthe apprehension of Courts and juries.  He left the Bench\r\nless than two years after I came to the Bar.  I never had\r\nbut one important case before him.  He was a bachelor.  He\r\nwas very interesting in conversation, liked the company of\r\nyoung men, who never left him without carrying away some delightful\r\nanecdote or shrewd and pithy observation.\r\n\r\nA lawyer from the country told me one day that he had just\r\nbeen in Fletcher's office to get his opinion.  While he was\r\nin the office, old Ebenezer Francis, a man said to be worth\r\n$8,000,000, then the richest man in New England, came to consult\r\nhim about a small claim against some neighbor.  Fletcher interrupted\r\nhis consultation with my friend and listened to Mr. Francis's\r\nstory.  In those days, parties could not be witnesses in their\r\nown cases.  Fletcher advised his client that although he had\r\nan excellent case, the evidence at his command was not sufficient\r\nto prove it, and advised against bringing an action.  Francis,\r\nwho was quite avaricious, left the office with a heavy heart.\r\nWhen he had gone, Fletcher turned to my friend and said: \"Isn't\r\nit pitiful, sir, to see an old critter, wandering about our\r\nstreets, destitute of proof?\"\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting and racy character among our old\r\nJudges was Theron Metcalf.  He used to say of himself--a saying\r\nthat did him great injustice--that he was taken to fill a\r\ngap in the Court as people take an old hat to stop a broken\r\nwindow.  He undervalued his own capacity.  He was not a good\r\nJudge to preside at jury trials.  He had queer and eccentric\r\nnotions of what the case was all about, and while he would\r\nstate a principle of law with extraordinary precision and\r\naccuracy he had not the gift of making practical application\r\nof the law to existing facts.  So a great many of his rulings\r\nwere set aside, and it did not seem, when he had held a long\r\nterm of Court, that a great deal had been accomplished.  But\r\nhe was a very learned common-lawyer.  His memory was a complete\r\ndigest of the decisions down to his time.  He comprehended\r\nwith marvellous clearness the precise extent to which any\r\nadjudged case went, and would state its doctrine with mathematical\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nHe hated statutes.  He was specially indignant at the abolition\r\nof special pleading.  He sent word to me, when I was Chairman\r\nof the Judiciary Committee in the Massachusetts Senate, asking\r\nto have a provision enacted for simplifying the process of\r\nbringing before the full Bench for revision the proceedings\r\nin habeas corpus, or mandamus, or certiorari, or some other\r\nspecial writ, I forget now what.  I called upon him at once,\r\nand pointed out to him that exactly what he wanted was accomplished\r\nby the Practice Act of 1852.  This was the statute under which\r\nall our legal proceedings in cases affecting personal property\r\nwere had.  Metcalf said, with great disgust: \"I have said,\r\nsir, that if they did not repeal that thing I would not read\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHe used to enliven his judgments with remarks showing a good\r\ndeal of shrewd wisdom.  In one case a man was indicted for\r\nadvertising a show without a license.  The defendant insisted\r\nthat the indictment was insufficient because it set out merely\r\nwhat the show purported to be, and not what it really was.\r\nOn which the Judge remarked:  \"The indictment sets out all\r\nthat is necessary, and, indeed, all that is safe.  The show\r\noften falls short of the promise in the show-bill.\"\r\n\r\nThere was once a case before him for a field-driver who had\r\nimpounded cattle under the old Massachusetts law.  The case\r\ntook a good many days to try, and innumerable subtle questions\r\nwere raised.  The Judge began his charge to the jury: \"Gentlemen\r\nof the jury, a man who takes up a cow straying in a highway\r\nis a fool.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time there was a contest as to the value of some\r\npersonal property which had been sold at auction.  One side\r\nclaimed that the auction-sale was a fair test of the value.\r\nThe other claimed that property that was sold at auction was\r\ngenerally sold at a sacrifice.  Metcalf said to the jury:\r\n\"According to my observation, things generally bring at auction\r\nall they are worth, except carpets.\"\r\n\r\nI once tried a case before him against the Norwich Railroad\r\nfor setting fire to the house of a farmer by a spark from\r\na locomotive.  It was a warm summer afternoon when the house\r\nwas burnt up.  There was no fire in the house except a few\r\ncoals among the ashes in a cooking stove where the dinner\r\nhad been cooked some hours before.  The railroad was very\r\nnear the house.  There was a steep up-grade, so that the engineers\r\nwere tempted to open the bonnet of their smokestacks for a\r\nbetter draught.  We called as a witness a sturdy, round-faced,\r\nfat old woman, who testified that she was sitting at her window,\r\nknitting, in a house some little distance away, when the train\r\nwent by.  She put in a mark to see, as she expressed it, \"how\r\nmany times round\" she could knit before supper.  A few minutes\r\nafter, she heard a cry of fire, and looked out and saw a blaze\r\non the roof of her neighbor's house, just kindling, close\r\nto the eaves on the side where the engine had passed.  She\r\nthrew down the stocking and went to help.  The stocking was\r\nfound after the fire with the mark just as she left it.  So\r\nwe claimed that we could tell pretty well how long the time\r\nhad been between the passing of the train and the breaking\r\nout of the fire.  Judge Metcalf, who was always fussy and\r\ninterfering, said:  \"How can we tell anything by that, unless\r\nwe know how large the stocking was?\"  The old lady, with\r\na most bland smile, turned to the Judge as if she were soothing\r\nan infant, lifted up the hem of her petticoats, and exhibited\r\na very sturdy ankle and calf, and said, \"Just the size I wear,\r\nyour Honor.\"  There was a roar of laughter in the court-house.\r\nThe incident was published in the morning paper the next day,\r\nmuch to the Judge's indignation.  He addressed the audience\r\nwhen he came into Court in the morning, and said: \"I see the\r\nWorcester _Spy_ has been trying to put a fool's cap on my\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Metcalf told me this story about Chief Justice Parsons.\r\nThe Chief Justice's manner to the Bar, as is well-known, was\r\nexceedingly rough.  He was no respecter of persons, and treated\r\nthe old and eminent lawyers quite as harshly as the youngsters.\r\nThe Bar used to call him Ursa Major.  The Chief Justice used\r\nto look over the pleadings carefully before the trials began.\r\nIt was in the time when special pleading often brought the\r\nissue to be decided into a narrow compass.  Soon after the\r\ncase was begun, the Judge would take the case out of the hands\r\nof the counsel and examine the witnesses himself, and give\r\nan opinion which was likely to be implicitly followed by the\r\njury.  Jabez Upham, of Brookfield, in Worcester County, Mr.\r\nJustice Gray's grandfather, once sent his office-boy to Court\r\nwith a green bag containing his papers, thinking there was\r\nno use in going himself.  At last the leading members of the\r\nBar in Boston got very angry, and four or five of them agreed\r\ntogether to teach the old Chief a lesson.  So they sat down\r\nto a trial in the Supreme Court where Parsons was presiding.\r\nPretty soon he interfered with the lawyer who was putting\r\nin the case for the plaintiff, in his rough way.  The lawyer\r\nrose and said:  \"I cannot take care of my client's rights\r\nwhere my own are not respected,\" or something to that effect.\r\n\"I will ask Brother Sullivan to take my place.\" Sullivan,\r\nwho was possessed of the case, took the place.  The trial\r\nwent on a little while, when something happened which offended\r\nSullivan.  He rose and said he could not go on with the case\r\nafter his Honor's remark, and would ask Brother So-and-So,\r\nperhaps Otis, to take his place.  This happened three or four\r\ntimes in succession.  The Chief Justice saw the point and\r\nadjourned the Court very early for the noon recess, and went\r\nto the house of his colleague, Judge Sewall, who lived out\r\nsomewhere on the Neck, called him out and said: \"You must\r\ngo down and hold that Court.  There is a con_spire_acy sir.\"\r\nParsons never held a _nisi-prius_ term in Suffolk again.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Shaw used to tell with great indignation the\r\nstory of his first appearance before Parsons, when a young\r\nman.  There was a very interesting question of the law of\r\nreal property, and Samuel Dexter, then the head of the Bar,\r\nwas on the other side.  Parsons was interested in the question\r\nas soon as it was stated, and entered into a discussion with\r\nDexter in which they both got earnestly engaged.  The Chief\r\nJustice intimated his opinion very strongly and was just deciding\r\nit in Dexter's favor, when the existence of the young man\r\non the other side occurred to him.  He looked over the bar\r\nat Shaw and said:  \"Well, young man, do you think you can\r\naid the Court any in this matter?\"   \"I think I can, sir,\"\r\nsaid Shaw with spirit.  Parsons listened to him, but, I believe,\r\nremained of his first opinion.\r\n\r\nJudge Metcalf in the time when he was upon the Bench had the\r\ncredit, I do not know how well deserved it was, of not being\r\nmuch given to hospitality.  He was never covetous, and he\r\nwas very fond of society and conversation.  But I fancy he\r\nhad some fashions of his own in housekeeping which he thought\r\nwere not quite up to the ways of modern life.  At any rate,\r\nhe was, so far as I know, never known to invite any of his\r\nbrethren upon the Bench or of the Bar to visit him at his\r\nhouse, with one exception.  One of the Judges told me that\r\nafter a hard day's work in court the Judges sat in consultation\r\ntill between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, and he walked\r\naway from the Court-House with Judge Metcalf.  The Judge went\r\nalong with him past the Tremont House, where my informant\r\nwas staying.  As they walked up School Street, he said: \"Why,\r\nJudge Metcalf, I didn't know you went this way.  I thought\r\nyou lived out on the Neck somewhere.\" \"No, sir,\" said Judge\r\nMetcalf, \"I live at number so-and-so Charles Street, and I will\r\nsay to you what I heard a man say the first night I moved\r\ninto my present house.  I heard a great noise in the street after\r\nmidnight, and got up and put my head out of the window.  There\r\nwas a man lying down on the sidewalk struggling, and another\r\nman, who seemed to be a policeman, was on top of him holding\r\nhim down.  The fellow with his back to the ground said: 'Let\r\nme get up, --- d--- you,'  The policeman answered: 'I sha'n't\r\nlet you get up till you tell me what your name is and where\r\nyou live.'  The fellow answered, 'My name is Jerry Mahoney,\r\n--- d--- you, and I live at No.  54 Cambridge Street, --- d---\r\nyou, where I'd be happy to see you, --- d--- you, if you dare\r\nto call.\"  That was the only instance known to his judicial\r\nbrothers of Judge Metcalf's inviting a friend to visit him.\r\n\r\nJudge Metcalf's legal opinions will read, I think, in the\r\nfuture, as well as those of any Judge of his time.  They are\r\nbrief, compact, written in excellent English, and precisely\r\nfit the case before him without any extraneous or superfluous\r\nmatter.  He would have been a very great Judge, indeed, if\r\nhis capacity for the conduct of jury trials and dealing with\r\n_nisi-prius_ business in general had equalled his ability\r\nto write opinions on abstract questions.\r\n\r\nJohn Davis was never a Judge.  But a few words about him may\r\nwell find a place here.  He had long since withdrawn from\r\nthe practice of law when I came to Worcester.  He remained\r\nin the Senate of the United States until March 4, 1853.  But\r\nthe traditions of his great power with juries remained.  I\r\nwas once or twice a guest in his house, and once or twice\r\nheard him make political speeches.\r\n\r\nMy father, who had encountered all the great advocates of his\r\ntime in New England--Webster, Choate, Jeremiah Mason, Dexter--\r\nused to say that John Davis was the toughest antagonist he\r\never encountered.  Mr. Davis had no graces of oratory or person.\r\nHe was not without a certain awkward dignity.  His head was\r\ncovered with thick and rather coarse white hair.  He reminded\r\nyou a little, in look and movement, of a great white bear.\r\nBut he had a gift of driving his point home to the apprehension\r\nof juries and of the people which was rarely equalled.  He\r\nwas a man of few words and infrequent speech, without wit\r\nor imagination.  He thoroughly mastered the subjects with\r\nwhich he dealt.  When he had inserted his wedge, he drove\r\nit home with a few sledge-hammer blows.  It was commonly\r\nimpossible for anybody to extract it.  It was only the great\r\nweight of his authority, and the importance of the matters\r\nwith which he dealt, which kept him from seeming exceedingly\r\ntedious.  I remember thinking when I heard him make a speech\r\nin behalf of General Scott in the City Hall, in the autumn\r\nof 1852, that if any man but John Davis were talking the audience\r\ncould not be kept awake.  He spoke very slowly, with the tone\r\nand manner of an ordinary conversation.  \"The Whigs, fellow-\r\ncitizens, have presented for your suffrages this year, for\r\nthe office of President of the United States, the name of\r\nMajor-General Winfield Scott.  I know General Scott.  I have\r\nhad good opportunity to acquaint myself with his character\r\nand public service.  I think you may give him your confidence,\r\ngentlemen.\"  That was pretty much the whole speech.  At any\r\nrate, there was nothing more exciting in it.  But it was John\r\nDavis that said it, and it had great effect upon his audience.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis supported General Taylor for President in 1848,\r\nthereby, on the one hand, offending Mr. Webster, with whom\r\nhis relations had for some time been exceedingly strained,\r\nand the anti-slavery men in Massachusetts on the other.  It\r\nwas understood also that he had displeased Governor Lincoln\r\nat the time of his election to the Senate, Governor Lincoln\r\nthinking that Mr. Davis had taken an undue advantage of his\r\nofficial influence as Governor to promote his own selection.\r\nBut the two united in the support of General Taylor, which\r\nled Charles Allen to quote a verse which has been more than\r\nonce applied in the same way since, \"And in that day Pilate\r\nand Herod were made friends together.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis was a careful and prudent manager of money matters,\r\nand left what was, for his time, a considerable estate, considering\r\nthe fact that so much of his life had been passed in the public\r\nservice.  His success in public life was, doubtless, in large\r\nmeasure, increased by his accomplished and admirable wife,\r\nthe sister of George Bancroft.  She was a lady of simple dignity,\r\ngreat intelligence, great benevolence and kindness of heart.\r\nHer conversation was always most delightful, especially in\r\nher old age, when her mind was full of the treasures of her\r\nlong experience and companionship with famous persons.  Mr.\r\nDavis left five sons, all of them men of ability.  The eldest\r\nhas been Minister to Berlin, Assistant Secretary of State,\r\nSecretary of Legation in London, Judge of the Court of Claims,\r\nand Reporter of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States.  Another son, Horace, has been a member of\r\nCongress, eminent in the public life of California, and, I\r\nbelieve, president of the University of California.\r\n\r\nJohn Davis won great distinction by a very powerful speech\r\non the tariff question in reply to James Buchanan.  Buchanan\r\nwas one of the most powerful Democratic leaders in the Senate,\r\nbut Davis was thought by the Whigs to have got much the better\r\nof him in the debate.  It was generally expected that he would\r\nbe the Whig candidate for the Vice-Presidency in 1840.  But\r\nanother arrangement was made, for reasons which may be as\r\nwell told here.  The Whig Convention to nominate a President\r\nwas held at Harrisburg, Pa., in December 4, 1839, nearly a\r\nyear before the election.  The delegates from the different\r\nStates were asked to consult together and agree upon their\r\nfirst choice.  Then they were asked to say whom they thought\r\nnext to the person they selected would be the strongest candidate.\r\nWhen the result was ascertained, it was discovered that William\r\nHenry Harrison was thought by a very large majority of the\r\nConvention to be the strongest candidate they could find.\r\nHe was accordingly selected as the Whig standard-bearer.\r\nA committee of one person from each State was then chosen to\r\npropose to the Convention a candidate for Vice-President.\r\nBenjamin Watkins Leigh, of Virginia, was a strong supporter\r\nof Henry Clay, a man of great personal worth, highly esteemed\r\nthroughout the country.  The Convention adjourned, and came\r\nin after the adjournment to hear the report of the committee.\r\nMr. Leigh accosted the Chairman of the committee and stood\r\nwith him in a conspicuous place as the delegates filed in.\r\nHe inquired of the Chairman what conclusion they had come\r\nto as to a candidate for Vice-President.  To which the Chairman\r\nreplied:  \"You will be informed in due time.\" When the Convention\r\nwas called to order, one of the delegates from Massachusetts\r\nmade a speech in which he set forth the high qualities that\r\nwere desired in a candidate for this important office, and,\r\nafter giving a sketch of exalted character and great capacity\r\nfor the public service, he ended by declaring that such a\r\nman was Mr. Leigh, of Virginia, and proposing his name as\r\nthe unanimous recommendation of the committee.  Mr. Leigh\r\nwas taken aback.  He had been a zealous supporter of Mr.\r\nClay.  He addressed the chair, saying he was much gratified\r\nby what had been said by his friend from Massachusetts, and\r\nhe hoped he might live in some humble measure to deserve the\r\ntribute which had been paid to him.  But he thought that having\r\nbeen a zealous supporter of Mr. Clay, and having had, in some\r\nsense, the charge of his candidacy, he could not himself accept\r\na nomination in connection with another person without exposing\r\nhimself to the suspicion that he had in some way benefitted\r\nby the defeat of his own candidate and leader.  It was said\r\nthat his embarrassment was increased by the fact that he had\r\nbeen seen conversing with the Chairman of the committee by\r\nthe members of the Convention.  How that is I do not know.\r\nThe result was the nomination of Mr. Tyler, his election,\r\nhis succession to the Presidency after the death of Harrison,\r\nwhich resulted in such disastrous consequences to the Whigs.\r\n\r\nJohn Davis was a Federalist and a Whig.  His sons were Whigs\r\nand Republicans always on the conservative side of public\r\nquestions.  His nephew, Colonel Isaac Davis, was in that respect\r\na contrast to his uncle.\r\n\r\nIt has been charged that John Davis, by taking up the time\r\nat the close of the session of Congress by an indiscreet\r\nspeech, was the means of defeating the Wilmot Proviso, which\r\nhad come from the House inserted in a bill for the incorporation\r\nof Oregon as a Territory.  This statement has received general\r\ncirculation.  It is made in Pierce's \"Life of Sumner,\" and\r\nin Von Holst's \"Constitutional History.\" There is no truth\r\nin it.  I investigated the matter very carefully, and have\r\nleft on record a conclusive refutation of the whole story\r\nin a paper published by the American Antiquarian Society.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis's popularity, however, enabled him to render an\r\nimportant service to his party at home.  The Democrats in\r\n1839 had elected their governor, Marcus Morton, by a majority\r\nof one vote by reason of the unpopularity of the law to prevent\r\nliquor-selling, known as the Fifteen-Gallon Law, which had\r\nbeen passed in January, 1838.  They were anxious to redeem\r\nthe State, and summoned John Davis, their strongest and most\r\npopular man, to lead their forces.  He accordingly resigned\r\nhis seat in the Senate, was chosen Governor by a large majority,\r\nand was reelected to the Senate again the next year.\r\n\r\nSketches like these, made by a man who was young when the\r\nmen he is talking about were old, are apt to give prominence\r\nto trifles, to little follies and eccentricities.  Let nobody\r\nthink that there was anything trifling or ludicrous about\r\nJohn Davis.  He was a great, strong, wise man, a champion\r\nand tower of strength.  He not only respected, but embodied\r\nthe great traditions and opinions of Massachusetts in the\r\ngreat days, after the generation of the Revolution had left\r\nthe state when she earned for herself the name of the \"Model\r\nCommonwealth,\" and her people were building the structure\r\nof the Commonwealth on the sure foundations which the master-\r\nworkmen of the Colonial and Revolutionary days had laid.  The\r\nmajestic presence of Webster, the classic eloquence of Everett,\r\nthe lofty zeal of Sumner have made them more conspicuous figures\r\nin the public eye, and it is likely will preserve their memeory\r\nlonger in the public heart.  But the figure of John Davis\r\ndeserves to stand by the side of these great men in imperishable\r\nmemory as one of the foremost men of the State he loved so\r\nwell and served so faithfully and wisely.\r\n\r\nThe Bar of Worcester County in 1850 and the years following\r\nwas a very able one, indeed.  It had many men of high reputation\r\nin the Commonwealth and some of wide national fame.  The principal\r\ncitizen of Worcester and the most distinguished member of\r\nthe Bar was Governor Levi Lincoln.  Although he had long since\r\nleft practice, he used always to come into the court once\r\nat each term of the Supreme Court, bow respectfully to the\r\nBench, and invite the Judges to dinner at his house, and withdraw.\r\nHe filled a very large place in the history of Massachusetts\r\nfrom the time of his graduation at Harvard in 1802 until the\r\nclose of the War in 1865.  There is, so far as I know, no\r\nmemoir of him in existence, except one or two brief sketches\r\nwhich appear in the proceedings of some local societies of\r\nwhich he was a member.\r\n\r\nHis father, Levi Lincoln the elder, was an intimate friend\r\nand correspondent of Mr. Jefferson, and Attorney-General\r\nin his Cabinet.  He was nominated Judge of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States by Mr. Madison and confirmed by the Senate\r\nand actually appointed, but was unable to take the office\r\nbecause of failing sight.  He did more, probably, than any\r\nother man to organize and bring to success the political revolution\r\nin New England which followed Jefferson's accession to the\r\nPresidency in 1801.  Many letters to him are found in Mr.\r\nJefferson's published works, and there are many letters from\r\nhim to Mr. Jefferson in the Jefferson papers in the archives\r\nat Washington.  Some of the correspondence on both sides is\r\nenough to make the hair of the civil service reformer stand\r\non end.  The son adopted his father's political opinions and\r\nwas an enthusiastic supporter of Jefferson in his youth.  Jefferson\r\nwrote a letter, which I think is now in existence, praising\r\nvery highly some of young Mr. Lincoln's early performances.\r\nHe delivered an address at Worcester, March 4, 1803, a few\r\nmonths after he left college, in which he proposed that the\r\nFourth of March, the day of Mr. Jefferson's accession to\r\nthe Presidency, should be celebrated thereafter instead of\r\nthe Fourth of July.  He says: \"Republicans no longer can hail\r\nthe day as exclusively theirs.  Federalism has profaned it.\r\nShe has formed to herself an idol in the union of Church and\r\nState, and this is the time chosen to offer its sacrifice.\"\r\nHe sets forth \"the long train of monstrous aggressions of\r\nthe Federalists\" under Washington and Adams; declares that\r\nthey \"propose a hereditary executive and a Senatorial nobility\r\nfor life,\" and says that the \"hand would tremble in recording,\r\nand the tongue falter in reciting, the long tale of monstrous\r\naggression.  But on the Fourth of March was announced from\r\nthe Capitol the triumph of principle.  Swifter than Jove on\r\nhis imperial eagle did the glad tiding of its victory pervade\r\nthe Union.  As vanish the mists of the morning before the\r\nrays of a sunbeam, so error withdrew from the inquiries of\r\nthe understanding.  The reign of terror had passed,\" etc.,\r\netc.  But there never was a better example of Emerson's maxim\r\nthat \"a Conservative is a Democrat grown old and gone to seed.\"\r\nAs the young man grew in reputation and influence he became\r\nmore moderate in his opinions.  He was appointed Judge of\r\nthe Supreme Court; then was elected Governor by a union of\r\nall parties in what was called \"the era of good feeling\";\r\nheld the office nine years; then represented the Worcester\r\ndistrict in Congress, and withdrew to a dignified and honorable\r\nretirement from which he emerged to hold the office of Mayor\r\nof Worcester the first year of the life of the city.  He was,\r\nas I remember him, the very embodiment of dignity and aristocracy.\r\nHe had a diffuse and rather inflated style, both in public\r\nspeaking and in private conversation.  His dignity had a bare\r\nsuspicion of pomposity in it.  He looked with great disdain\r\nupon the simplicity of behavior of some of his successors,\r\nand their familiarity with all classes of the people.  He\r\ncame into my office one morning full of an intense disgust\r\nwith something Governor Briggs had been doing.  He said: \"In\r\nmy time, sir, the office of Governor of the Commonwealth was\r\nan office of dignity.  The arrival of the Chief Magistrate\r\nin any town was an event of some importance.  He travelled\r\nin his carriage, with suitable attendants.  He appeared in\r\npublic only on great occasions.  But now you see hand-bills\r\nabout the street giving notice that there is to be a Temperance\r\ntea-party to-morrow afternoon, in some vestry or small hall.\r\nMusic by the Peak family.  His Excellency George N. Briggs\r\nwill address the meeting.  Admission, ten cents.\"\r\n\r\nHe accepted his position at the head of the social life of\r\nWorcester as a matter of course.  I remember one night, when\r\na party was breaking up, I said to the person next to me, in\r\nsome jesting fashion:  \"I am sorry to see the decay of the\r\nold aristocracy.\"  The Governor, who was getting his coat\r\nat the other end of the room, overheard the remark, and called\r\nout:  \"Who is lamenting our decay?\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor looked with great disgust upon the formation\r\nof the Free Soil Party and the Anti-Slavery movement.  But\r\nwhen the war came he remained thoroughly loyal.  He encouraged\r\nenlistment in every way, and measures for the support of the\r\nGovernment had all the weight of his influence.  He was a\r\nPresidential elector, and voted for Abraham Lincoln at the\r\ntime of his second election.\r\n\r\nWhen Webster was first chosen Senator he refused to be a candidate\r\nfor the office until it was ascertained whether Governor Lincoln\r\nwould accept it.  The Governor then declined, for the reason\r\nI have stated in another place.  He was also offered an appointment\r\nto the Senate by Governor Washburn when Mr. Everett resigned\r\nin 1853.  But it is said that he was quite desirous of being\r\nelected Senator when Mr. Davis was first chosen.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was, as just said, an example of Emerson's famous\r\nsaying that a Conservative is a Democrat grown old and gone\r\nto seed.  He was looked upon as the embodiment of reverend\r\ndignity.  His household was at the head of the social life\r\nof Worcester during his later years.  Every family in the\r\nCounty was proud who could trace a connection with his.  There\r\nwere a few traditions in the old Federalist families like\r\nthe Thomases and the Allens of a time when the Lincolns were\r\naccounted too democratic to be respectable.  But they gained\r\nlittle credence with people in general.  One day, however,\r\nI had to try a real estate case which arose in the adjoining\r\ntown and involved an ancient land-title.  An old man named\r\nBradyill Livermore was summoned as a witness for my client.\r\nHe was, I think, in his ninety-fifth year.  He lived in a\r\nsparsely settled district and had not been into Worcester\r\nfor twenty or twenty-five years.  I sat down with him in the\r\nconsultation-room.  After he had told me what he knew about\r\nthe case, I had a chat with him about old times and the changes\r\nin Worcester since his youth, and he asked me about some of\r\nthe members of the Bar then on the stage.  Governor Lincoln,\r\nwho had long retired, happened to be mentioned.  The old fellow\r\nbrought the point of his staff down with great emphasis upon\r\nthe floor, and then held it loosely with the fingers of his\r\ntrembling and shaking hand, and said, very earnestly, but\r\nwith a shrill and strident voice like that of one of Homer's\r\nghosts: \"They say, sir, that that Mr. Lincoln has got to\r\nbe a very respectable man.  But I can remember, sir, when\r\nhe was a terrible Jacobite.\"\r\n\r\nI have given elsewhere a portraiture of Charles Allen, and\r\na sketch of his great career.  He was a man of slender physical\r\nframe and feeble voice.  But he was a leader of leaders.\r\nWhen in 1848 he left the Whig Convention in Philadelphia,\r\nan assembly flushed with the anticipation of National triumph,\r\ndeclaring, amid the jeers and hisses of its members, that\r\nthe Whig Party was dead--a prediction verified within four\r\nyears--down to the election of Lincoln, in 1860, he was in\r\nMassachusetts a powerful influence.  He was a great advocate,\r\na great judge, a great counsellor.  He was in my judgment\r\na greater intellectual force than any other man in his time,\r\nDaniel Webster not excepted.  It was a force before which\r\nWebster himself more than once recoiled.  I knew him intimately\r\nand was, I believe, admitted to no inconsiderable share of\r\nhis confidence.  But there is no space here to do justice\r\nto my reverence for his noble character.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the most successful of the Worcester Bar, in\r\nmy time, in the practice of his profession, was Emory Washburn.\r\nHe was a man of less intellectual power undoubtedly than either\r\nof his great contemporaries and antagonists, Allen, Merrick,\r\nor Thomas.  Yet he probably won more cases, year in and year\r\nout, than either of them.  He was a man of immense industry.\r\nHe went to his office early in the morning, took a very short\r\ntime, indeed, for his meals, and often kept at work until\r\none or two o'clock in the morning of the next day.  He suffered\r\nseverely at one time from dyspepsia brought on by constant\r\nwork and neglect of exercise; but generally he kept his vigorous\r\nhealth until his death at the age of eighty.  He was indefatigable\r\nin his service to his clients.  His mind was like a steel\r\nspring pressing on every part of the other side's case.  It\r\nwas ludicrous to see his sympathy and devotion to his clients,\r\nand his belief in the cause of any man whom he undertook to\r\nchampion.  It seemed as if a client no sooner put his head\r\non the handle of Washburn's office-door than his heart warmed\r\nto him like that of a mother toward her first-born.  No strength\r\nof evidence to the contrary, no current of decisions settling\r\nthe law would prevent Washburn from believing that his man\r\nwas the victim of prejudice or persecution or injustice.  But\r\nhis sincerity, his courtesy of manner and kindness of heart\r\nmade him very influential with juries, and it was rare that\r\na jury sat in Worcester county that had not half a dozen\r\nof Washburn's clients among their number.\r\n\r\nI was once in a very complicated real estate case as Washburn's\r\nassociate.  Charles Allen and Mr. Bacon were on the other\r\nside.  Mr. Bacon and I, who were juniors, chatted about the\r\ncase just before the trial.  Mr. Bacon said: \"Why, Hoar, Emory\r\nWashburn doesn't understand that case the least in the world.\"\r\nI said, \"No, Mr. Bacon, he doesn't understand the case the\r\nleast in the world.  But you may depend upon it he will make\r\nthat jury misunderstand it just as he does.\" And he did.\r\n\r\nCharles Allen, who never spared any antagonist, used to be\r\nmerciless in dealing with Washburn.  He once had a case with\r\nhim which attracted a great deal of public attention.  There\r\nhad been a good many trials and the cost had mounted up to\r\na large sum.  It was a suit by a farmer who had lost a flock\r\nof sheep by dogs, and who tried to hold another farmer responsible\r\nas the owner of the dog which had killed them.  One of the\r\nwitnesses had been out walking at night and heard the bark\r\nof the dog in the field where the sheep were.  He was asked\r\nto testify if he could tell what dog it was from the manner\r\nof his bark.  The evidence was objected to, and Allen undertook\r\nto support his right to put the question.  He said we were\r\nable to distinguish men from each other by describing their\r\nmanner and behavior, when the person describing might not\r\nknow the man by name.  \"For instance, may it please your Honor,\r\nsuppose a stranger who came into this court-house during this\r\ntrial were called to testify to what took place, and he should\r\nsay that he did not know anybody in the room by sight, but\r\nthere was a lawyer there who was constantly interrupting the\r\nother side, talking a great deal of the time, but after all\r\ndidn't seem to have much to say.  Who would doubt that he\r\nmeant my Brother Washburn?\"\r\n\r\nThis gibe is only worth recording as showing the court-house\r\nmanners of those times.  It is no true picture of the honest,\r\nfaithful and beloved Emory Washburn.  He was public-spirited,\r\nwise, kind-hearted, always ready to give his service without\r\nhope of reward or return to any good cause, a pillar of the\r\ntown, a pillar of the church.  He had sometimes a certain\r\nconfusion of statement and of thought, but it was only apparent\r\nin his oral discourse.  He wrote two admirable law-books,\r\none on easements, and one on real property.  Little & Brown\r\nsaid his book on easements had the largest sale of any law-\r\nbook ever published in this country up to its time.  He was\r\na popular and useful Professor in the Harvard Law School.\r\nHe gave a great deal of study to the history of Massachusetts,\r\nand was the author of some valuable essays on historical questions,\r\nand some excellent discourses on historical occasions.  He\r\nleft no duty undone.  Edward Hale used to say: \"If you want\r\nanything done well, go to the busiest man in Worcester to\r\ndo it--Emory Washburn, for example.\" He was grievously disappointed\r\nthat he was not appointed Judge of the Supreme Court when\r\nJudge Thomas became a member of the Bench.  A little while\r\nafterward there was another vacancy, and Governor Clifford\r\ntook Merrick, another of Washburn's contemporaries and rivals\r\nat the bar, although Merrick was a Democrat, and the Governor,\r\nlike Washburn himself, was a Whig.  This was almost too much\r\nfor him to bear.  It took place early in the year 1853.  Mr.\r\nWashburn sailed for Europe a few weeks after, and felt almost\r\nlike shaking off the dust of his feet against Massachusetts\r\nand the Whig Party.  But he was very agreeably compensated\r\nfor his disappointment.  During his absence he was nominated\r\nby the Whigs for the office of Governor, to which office he\r\nwas elected in the following January, there being then, under\r\nour law, which required a clear majority of all the votes,\r\nno choice by the people.  He made an admirable and popular\r\nGovernor.  But the Nebraska Bill was introduced in that year.\r\nThis created strong excitement among the people of Massachusetts,\r\nand the Know-Nothing movement came that fall, inspired more\r\nby the desire of the people to get rid of the old parties,\r\nand form a new anti-slavery party, than by any real opposition\r\nto foreigners, which was its avowed principle.  This party\r\nswept Massachusetts, electing all the State officers and every\r\nmember of the State Legislature except two from the town of\r\nNorthampton.  They had rather a sorry Legislature.  It was\r\nthe duty of the outgoing Governor to administer the oath to\r\nthe Representatives- and Senators-elect.  Governor Washburn\r\nperformed that duty, and added: \"Now, gentlemen, so far as\r\nthe oath of office is concerned, you are qualified to enter\r\nupon your duties.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Washburn was a thorough gentleman, through and through,\r\ncourteous, well-bred, and with an entirely sufficient sense\r\nof his own dignity.  But he had little respect for any false\r\nnotions of gentility, and had a habit of going straight at\r\nany difficulty himself.  To this habit he owed much of his\r\nsuccess in life.  A very amusing story was told by Mrs. Washburn\r\nlong after her husband's death.  She was one of the brightest\r\nand sprightliest and wittiest of women.  Her husband owed\r\nto her much of his success in life, as well as much of his\r\ncomfort and domestic enjoyment.  She used to give sometimes\r\nhalf a dozen entertainments in the same week.  She was never\r\ndisconcerted by any want of preparation or suddenness of demand\r\nupon her hospitality.  One day some quite distinguished guests\r\narrived in Worcester unexpectedly, whom it was proper that\r\nshe should keep to dinner.  The simple arrangements which\r\nhad been made for herself and her husband would not do.  She\r\naccordingly went at once to the principal hotel of the town, in\r\nthe neighborhood, and bargained with the landlord to send\r\nover the necessary courses for her table, which were just\r\nhot and cooked and ready for his own.  She got off very comfortably\r\nwithout being detected.\r\n\r\nHer story was that one time when Judge Washburn was Governor\r\nthe members of his Staff came to Worcester on some public\r\noccasion and were all invited to his house to spend the night.\r\nWhen he got up in the morning he found, to his consternation,\r\nthat the man who was in the habit of doing such services at\r\nhis house was sick, or for some other reason had failed to\r\nput in an appearance, and none of the boots of the young gentlemen\r\nwere blacked.  The Governor was master of the situation.  He\r\ndescended to his cellar, took off his coat, blacked all the\r\nboots of the youngsters himself, and met them at breakfast\r\nwith his usual pleasant courtesy, as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nI do not undertake to give a full sketch of Benjamin F. Thomas.\r\nHe was one of the very greatest of American lawyers.  But\r\nsuch desultory recollections as these are apt to dwell only\r\non the eccentricities or peculiarities or foibles of men.\r\nThey are not the place for elaborate and noble portraiture.\r\n\r\nJudge Thomas was the principal figure in the Worcester court-\r\nhouse after Judge Allen's election to Congress in 1848.  Judge\r\nThomas did not get large professional business very rapidly.\r\nHe was supposed, in his youth, to be a person of rather eccentric\r\nmanners, studious, fond of poetry and general literature and\r\nof historical and antiquarian research.  He was impulsive,\r\nsomewhat passionate, but still with an affectionate, sunny,\r\ngenerous nature, and a large heart, to which malice, hatred,\r\nor uncharitableness were impossible.  It is said that in his\r\nyounger days he used to walk the streets, wrapped in his own\r\nthoughts, unconscious of the passers-by, and muttering poetry\r\nto himself.  But when I came into his office as a student,\r\nin August, 1849, all this trait had disappeared.  He was a\r\nconsummate advocate, a favorite alike with Judges and jurors,\r\nwinning his causes wherever success was possible, and largely\r\nemployed.  He had a clear voice, of great compass, pitched\r\non rather a high key, but sweet and musical like the sound\r\nof a bugle.  The young men used to fill the court-house to\r\nhear his arguments to juries.  He became a very profound lawyer,\r\nalways mastering the learning of the case, but never leaning\r\ntoo much upon authorities.  Charles Emerson's beautiful phrase\r\nin his epitaph upon Professor Ashmun, \"Books were his helpers,\r\nnever his masters,\" was most aptly applied to Thomas.  If\r\nhe had any foible which affected at all his usefulness or\r\nsuccess in life it was an impatience of authority, whether\r\nit were the authority of a great reputation, or of party,\r\nor of public sentiment, or of the established and settled\r\nopinions of mankind.  He went on the Supreme Bench in 1853.\r\nDissenting opinions were rare in the Massachusetts Supreme\r\nCourt in those days.  In this I think the early Judges were\r\nextremely wise.  Nothing shakes the authority of a court more\r\nthan the frequent habit of individual dissent.  But Judge\r\nThomas dissented from the judgments of his court on several\r\nvery important occasions.  His dissenting opinions were exceedingly\r\nalike.  I think it would have been better if they had not\r\nbeen delivered.  I think he would have been much more likely\r\nto have come to the other conclusion if the somewhat imperious\r\nintellect of Shaw had not been put into the prevailing scale.\r\nWhen all Massachusetts bowed down to Webster, Judge Thomas,\r\nthough he respected and honored the great public idol, supported\r\nTaylor as a candidate for the Presidency.  At the dinner\r\ngiven to the Electoral College after the election, where Mr.\r\nWebster was present, Judge Thomas shocked the meeting by saying:\r\n\"Some persons have spoken of our candidate as their second\r\nchoice.  I am proud to say that General Taylor was not only\r\nmy last, but my first choice.\"  So, when Judge Thomas was\r\nin Congress, while he was as thoroughly loyal, patriotic,\r\nand brave a man as ever lived, he opposed the policies of\r\nthe Republican Party for carrying on the war and putting down\r\nthe Rebellion.  He was thought to be inspired by a great dislike\r\nof submitting to party authority or even to that of President\r\nLincoln.  He was very fond of young men.  When he was Judge\r\nthey always found that they had all the consideration that\r\nthey deserved, and had no fear of being put at a disadvantage\r\nby any antagonist, however able or experienced.  The Judge\r\nseemed always to be stirred by the suggestion of an intellectual\r\ndifficulty.  When I was seeking some remedy at his hands,\r\nespecially in equity, I used to say that I thought I had a\r\njust case, but I was afraid his Honor might think the legal\r\ndifficulties were insuperable and I did not know whether I\r\ncould get his Honor's approbation of what I asked.  He would\r\ninstantly rouse himself and seem to take the suggestion as\r\na challenge, and if it were possible for human ingenuity to\r\nfind a way to accomplish what I wanted he would do it.  He\r\npreserved the sweetness and joyous spirit of boyhood to the\r\nday of his death.  It was delightful to catch him when he\r\nwas at leisure, to report to him any pleasant story that was\r\ngoing about, and to hear his merry laugh and pleasant voice.\r\nHe was a model of the judicial character.  It was a delight\r\nto practise before him at _nisi prius._ I have known a great\r\nmany admirable lawyers and a good many very great Judges.\r\nI have known some who had more learning, and some, I suppose,\r\nthough very few, who had greater vigor of intellect.  But\r\nno better Judge ever sat in a Massachusetts court-house.  Dwight\r\nFoster felicitously applied to him the sentence which was first\r\nuttered of Charles James Fox, that \"his intellect was all\r\nfeeling, and his feeling all intellect.\"\r\n\r\nDwight Foster came to the Bar just a week after I did.  But\r\nI ought not to omit him in any account of the Massachusetts\r\nlawyers or Judges of my time.  He rose rapidly to a place\r\nin the first rank of Massachusetts lawyers, which he held\r\nuntil his untimely death.  He was graduated the first scholar\r\nin his class at Yale in 1848.  Before he was graduated he\r\nbecame engaged to a very admirable and accomplished lady,\r\ndaughter of Roger S. Baldwin, Governor of Connecticut and\r\nUnited States Senator, then head of the Connecticut Bar.  This\r\nlady had some tendency to a disorder of the lungs and throat\r\nwhich had proved fatal to two of her brothers.  Dwight Foster\r\nwas very anxious to get her away from New Haven, where he\r\nthought the climate and her habit of mingling in gay society\r\nvery unfavorable to her health.  So he set himself to work\r\nto get admitted to the Bar and get established in business\r\nthat he might have a place for her in Worcester.  He was examined\r\nby Mr. Justice Metcalf, after studying a little more than\r\na year, and found possessed of attainments uncommon even for\r\npersons who had studied the full three years and had been\r\na good while at the Bar.  Judge Metcalf admitted him, and\r\non some other Judge criticising what he had done, the Judge\r\nsaid, with great indignation, \"If he thinks Foster is not\r\nqualified, let him examine him himself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Foster's first employment had very awkward consequences.\r\nThe people in Worcester had the old Puritanic dislike to theatrical\r\nentertainments, and had always refused to license such exhibitions.\r\nBut a company of actors desired to obtain a theatre for the\r\nseason and give performances in Worcester.  There was a great\r\nopposition, and the city government ordered a public hearing\r\nof the petition in the old City Hall.  Foster was employed\r\nby the petitioners.  The hall was crowded with citizens interested\r\nin the matter, and the Mayor and Aldermen sat in state on\r\nthe platform.  When the hearing was opened, the audience were\r\nstruck with astonishment by the coming forward of Dwight Foster's\r\nfather, the Hon. Alfred D. Foster, a highly honored citizen\r\nof great influence and ability.  He had been in the State\r\nSenate and had held some few political offices, but had disliked\r\nsuch service and had never practised law, having a considerable\r\nproperty which he had inherited from his father, the former\r\nUnited States Senator.  He made a most eloquent and powerful\r\nappeal to the aldermen to refuse the petition, in the name\r\nof morality and good order.  He stated the deplorable effect\r\nof attending such exhibitions on the character of the youth\r\nof our city of both sexes, cited the opinion and practice\r\nof our ancestors in such matters, and made a profound impression.\r\nHe then warned his hearers against the young man who was to\r\nfollow him, whom, he said, he loved as his life, but he was\r\nthere employed as a lawyer with his fee in his hand, without\r\nthe responsibility which rested upon them of protecting the\r\nmorals and good order of the city.  It was very seldom that\r\nso powerful a speech was heard in that hall, although it was\r\nthe cradle of the Anti-slavery movement, and had been the\r\nscene of some of the most famous efforts of famous orators.\r\nEverybody supposed that the youth was crushed and would not\r\nventure to perform his duty in the face of such an attack.\r\nBut he was fully equal to the occasion.  He met his father\r\nwith a clear, simple, modest, but extremely able statement\r\nof the other side; pointed out the harmlessness of such exhibitions\r\nwhen well conducted, and that the strictness which confounded\r\ninnocence and purity with guilt and vice was itself the parent\r\nand cause of vice.  He did not allude to his father by name\r\nor description, but in replying to his arguments said: \"It\r\nis said in some quarters,\" or \"An opposition comes from some\r\nquarters\" founded on such-and-such reasons.  He got the sympathy\r\nof his audience and carried his point.  And from that time\r\nnobody hesitated to trust Dwight Foster with any cause, however\r\nimportant, from any doubt of his capacity to take care of\r\nhis clients.\r\n\r\nHe had been brought up as a Whig.   But when the Nebraska\r\nBill was passed, he became a zealous and earnest Republican.\r\nHe was candidate for Mayor, but defeated on a very close vote\r\nby George W. Richardson.  He held the office of Judge of Probate\r\nfor a short time, by appointment of Governor Banks; was elected\r\nAttorney-General in 1860 when Governor Andrew was chosen Governor,\r\nand soon after was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court, an\r\noffice which he filled with great distinction, then left the\r\nBench to resume his practice, and died of a disease of the\r\nheart which he inherited from his ancestors.  He was Governor\r\nAndrew's Attorney-General during the War, who said of him\r\nthat \"he was full of the fire and hard-working zeal of Massachusetts.\"\r\nHe was the organ of the patriotism and energy of Worcester\r\nat the seat of government during the war, looking out for\r\nthe interests of her soldiers, and always urging the brave\r\nand vigorous counsel.  I lost a stanch friend by his death.\r\nI can sum up his qualities in no better way than by the word\r\n\"manliness.\"  He never uttered an ignoble word, thought an\r\nignoble thought, or did an ignoble act.  His method of speech\r\nwas clear, simple, spirited, without much pathos or emotion,\r\nbut still calculated to stir and move his hearers.\r\n\r\nI had more intimate relations with Judge Thomas L. Nelson\r\nthan with any other member of the Worcester Bar except those\r\nwith whom I formed a partnership.  We were never in partnership.\r\nBut after I went to Congress in 1869, he moved into my office\r\nuntil his appointment to the Bench.  So when I was at home\r\nwe were in the same room.  He had been accustomed for a long\r\ntime before to employ me to assist him in important trials\r\nbefore the jury and in arguments before the Supreme Court.\r\nI suppose I am responsible for his appointment to the District\r\nCourt, although the original suggestion was not mine.  After\r\nthe death of Judge Shepley, there was a general expectation\r\nthat Judge John Lowell, of the District Court, would be made\r\nCircuit Judge.  One morning one of the Boston papers suggested\r\nseveral names for the succession, among them that of Mr.\r\nKnowlton, of Springfield, and Mr. Nelson.  I said nothing\r\nto him.  But he observed:  \"I see in a paper that I am spoken\r\nof as District Judge.\"  I replied:  \"Yes, I saw the article.\"\r\nNeither of us said anything further on the subject.  When\r\nI got to Washington I met Mr. Devens, then Attorney-General,\r\nwho said, \"We shall have to appoint a District Judge, I suppose.\r\nI think your friend Nelson is the best man for it.  But I\r\nsuppose he would not accept it.\"  I said:  \"No, I don't believe\r\nhe would accept it.  But, if you think he is the best man\r\nfor it, the question whether he will accept it ought to be\r\ndetermined by him, and not by his friends for him.\" I had\r\nno thought that Mr. Nelson would leave his practice for the\r\nBench.  But I thought it would be a very agreeable thing to\r\nhim to have the offer.  I wrote to him a day or two afterward\r\nthat I thought it likely he would be offered the place.  He\r\nanswered by asking me, if it were to be offered to him, how\r\nmuch time would be given to him to consider the matter.  Soon\r\nafter I was informed by Attorney-General Devens that the President\r\nhad offered him the place on the Circuit Bench, and that he\r\nvery much desired to accept it.  But he thought that, although\r\nthe President had put the place at his disposal, he was very\r\nunwilling to have any change in the Cabinet, and doubted whether\r\nhe ought to accept the offer unless he were very sure the\r\nPresident was willing to spare him.  One day soon after, President\r\nHayes sent for me to come to see him.  I called at the Attorney-\r\nGeneral's office, told him the President had sent for me,\r\nand that he probably wished to speak about the Circuit Judgeship,\r\nand I wanted to know what he would like to have me say.  Devens\r\nsaid that he should prefer that way of spending the rest of\r\nhis life to any other.  But the President had done him a great\r\nhonor in inviting him to his Cabinet, and he did not wish\r\nto leave him unless he were sure that the President was willing.\r\nI went to the White House.  When President Hayes opened the\r\nsubject, I told him what was the Attorney-General's opinion.\r\nThe President said that if he could be sure that were true,\r\nit would relieve his mind of a great burden.  I told him he\r\ncould depend on it.  The President said he did not know anybody\r\nelse whom he should be as willing to have in his Cabinet as\r\nDevens, unless I myself would consent to accept the place.\r\nHe gave a little friendly urging in that direction.  I told\r\nhim that I had lately been elected to the Senate after a considerable\r\ncontroversy, and that I did not think I could in justice to\r\nthe people of the State make a vacancy in the office which\r\nwould occasion a new strife.  I called on Devens on my way\r\nback, and reported to him what the President had said.  He\r\nimmediately went to the White House, and they had a full understanding,\r\nwhich resulted in Devens keeping his place in the Cabinet\r\nthrough the Administration.\r\n\r\nIt was then suggested that while Judge Lowell was a most\r\nadmirable District Judge, and in every way an admirable lawyer,\r\nyet that it would be better if it were possible to get one\r\nof the leaders of the Bar, who would supply what Judge Lowell\r\nlacked--the capacity for charging juries on facts, and presiding\r\nat jury trials, and to leave him in the District Court, where\r\nhis services were so valuable.  The office of Circuit Judge\r\nwas accordingly offered to Mr. William G. Russell.  I wrote\r\nto Nelson, asking him to consider my first letter on the subject\r\nas not having been written.  Mr. Russell replied, declining\r\nthe place, and saying, with great emphasis that he was sorry\r\nthe President should hesitate a moment about offering the\r\nplace to Judge Lowell, whom he praised very highly.  But the\r\nPresident and the Attorney-General thought that it should\r\nbe offered to Mr. George O. Shattuck, a very eminent lawyer\r\nand advocate.  On inquiry, however, it turned out that Mr.\r\nShattuck, who was in poor health, was absent on a journey,\r\nand it was so unlikely that he would accept the offer that\r\nit was thought best not to diminish the value and honor to\r\nJudge Lowell of the place by offering it further to another\r\nperson.  Accordingly the place was offered to Judge Lowell\r\nand accepted by him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Devens than said to me:  \"I have been thinking over\r\nthe matter of the District Judge, and I think if a man entirely\r\nsuitable can be found in the Suffolk Bar, that the appointment\r\nrather belongs to that Bar, and I should like, if you have\r\nno objection, to propose to the President to offer it to Mr.\r\nCharles Allen.\"  Mr. Allen was later Judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Massachusetts.  I assented, but said:  \"If Mr. Allen\r\nrefuses it, I hope it will then be offered to Mr. Nelson,\r\nin accordance with your original opinion.\"  The Attorney-\r\nGeneral agreed.  The offer was made to Mr. Allen, and by him\r\ndeclined.  When the letter of refusal came, the Attorney-\r\nGeneral and I went together to the White House and showed\r\nthe President the letter.  In the meantime a very strong recommendation\r\nof Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., now of the Supreme Court,\r\nhad been received by the President.  He felt a good deal of\r\ninterest in Holmes.  I think they had both been wounded in\r\nthe same battle.  But, at any rate, they were comrades.  The\r\nPresident then said: \"I rather think Holmes is the man.\" I\r\nthen gave him my opinion of Mr. Nelson, and the President\r\nsaid to Devens: \"Do you agree, Mr. Attorney-General?\" Devens\r\nsaid:  \"I do.\" And the President said: \"Then Nelson be it.\"\r\nMr. Nelson, to my surprise, accepted the appointment.\r\n\r\nJudge Nelson was a master of equity and bankruptcy.  No doctrine\r\nwas too subtle or abstruse for him.  The matter of marshalling\r\nassets, or the tacking of mortgages, and such things which\r\nrequire a good deal of the genius of the mathematician, were\r\nclear in his apprehension.  He was one of the two or three\r\nmen in the State who ever understood the complications of\r\nthe old loan-fund associations.  He was especially a master\r\nof legal remedies.  He held on like a bull-dog to a case in\r\nthe justice of which he believed.  When you had got a verdict\r\nand judgment in the Supreme Court against one of Nelson's\r\nclients, he was just ready to begin work.  Then look out for\r\nhim.  He had with this trait also a great modesty and diffidence.\r\nIf anybody put to him confidently a proposition against his\r\nbelief, Nelson was apt to be silent, but, as Mr. Emerson\r\nsaid of Samuel Hoar, \"with an unaltered belief.\" He would\r\ncome out with his reply days after.  When he came to state\r\nthe strong point in arguing his case, he would sink his voice\r\nso it could hardly be heard, and look away like a bashful\r\nmaiden giving her consent.  Judge Bigelow told me, very early\r\nin Nelson's career, that he wished I would ask my friend to\r\nmake his arguments a little longer, and to raise his voice\r\nso the court could hear him better.  They always found his\r\narguments full of instruction, and disliked to lose anything\r\nso good a lawyer had to say.  His value as a Judge was largely\r\nin consultation and in his sound opinions.  I suppose that,\r\nlike his predecessor, Judge Lowell, he was not the very best\r\nof Judges to preside at jury trials, or to guide juries in\r\ntheir deliberations.  Indeed, Nelson had many of the intellectual\r\ntraits--the same merits and the same defects that Lowell\r\nhad.  Lowell was a man of great wit, and a favorite with\r\nthe Boston Bar when he was appointed.  So they made the best\r\nof him.  They were not inclined to receive Nelson's appointment\r\nvery graciously.  It was some years before he established\r\na high place in their confidence and esteem.  But it was established\r\nbefore his death.  Gray and Putnam and Webb, all in their\r\nway lawyers of the first class, found Nelson a most valuable\r\nand acceptable associate, and have all spoken of him in most\r\nenthusiastic terms.  He was a good naturalist.  He knew the\r\nsong-birds, their habits, and dwelling-places.  He knew all\r\nthe stars.  He liked to discuss difficult and profound questions\r\nof public policy, constitutional law, philosophy, and metaphysics.\r\nSometimes, when I came home from Washington after a period\r\nof hard work, if I happened to find Nelson in the cars when\r\nI went to Boston, it was almost painful to spend an hour with\r\nhim, although his conversation was very profound and interesting.\r\nBut it was like attempting to take up and solve a difficult\r\nproblem in geometry.  I was tired, and wanted to be humming\r\na negro melody to myself.  He was a man of absolute integrity,\r\nnot caring whether he pleased or displeased anybody.  He had\r\na good deal of literary knowledge, was specially fond of Emerson,\r\nand knew him very thoroughly, both prose and verse.  He had\r\na good deal of wit, one of the brightest examples of which\r\nI will not undertake to quote here.  He was a civil engineer\r\nin his youth, and was always valuable in complicated questions\r\nof boundary, or cases like our sewer and water cases, which\r\nrequire the application of practical mathematics.  He was\r\na friendly and placable person so far as he was concerned\r\nhimself, but resented, with great indignation, any unkindness\r\ntoward any of his friends or household.  His friend and associate,\r\nJudge Webb, after his death spoke with great beauty and pathos\r\nof Nelson's love of nature and of his old county home:\r\n\r\n\"When, in later years, he revisited the scenes of his childhood,\r\nhe made no effort to conceal his affection for them; as he\r\nwandered among the mountains and along the valleys, so dearly\r\nremembered, his eye would grow bright, his face beam with\r\npleasure, and his voice sound with the tone of deep sensibility.\r\nHe grew eloquent as he described the beauty spread out before\r\nhim, and lovingly dwelt on the majesty and grandeur of the\r\nmountain at the foot of which his infancy was cradled.  It\r\nwas high companionship to be with him at such times.  His\r\near was open to catch the note of every bird, which came to\r\nhim like voices of well-beloved friends; he knew the brooks\r\nfrom their sources to their mouths, and the rivers murmured\r\nto him the songs they sang in the Auld Lang Syne.  But deep\r\nas was the joy of these visits, they did not allure him from\r\nthe more rugged paths of labor and duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of Nelson's selection, if it need vindication,\r\nis abundantly established by the memorial of him reported\r\nby a committee, of which Lewis S. Dabney was chairman, and\r\nadopted by the Suffolk Bar.  The Bar, speaking of the doubt\r\nexpressed in the beginning by those who feared an inland lawyer\r\non the Admiralty Bench, goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\"Those who knew him well, however, knew that he had been a\r\nsuccessful master and referee in many complicated cases of\r\ngreat importance; that his mathematical and scientific knowledge\r\nacquired in his early profession as an engineer was large\r\nand accurate, and would be useful in his new position; that\r\nhe who had successfully drawn important public acts would\r\nbe a successful interpreter of such acts; that always a student\r\napproaching every subject, not as an advocate but as a judicial\r\nobserver, he would give that attention to whatever was new\r\namong the problems of his judicial office that would make\r\nhim their best master and interpreter, and that what in others\r\nmight be considered weakness or indolence was but evidence\r\nof a painful shrinking from displaying in public a naturally\r\nfirm, strong, earnest and persistent character, a character\r\nwhich would break out through the limitations of nature whenever\r\nthe occasion required it.\r\n\r\n\"Those who, as his associates upon the Bench, or as practitioners\r\nbefore him at the Bar, have had occasion to watch his long\r\nand honorable career, now feel that the judgment of his friends\r\nwas the best and that his appointment has been justified;\r\nand those who have known him as an Associate Justice of the\r\nCircuit Court of Appeals have felt this even more strongly.\"\r\n\r\nAnother striking figure of my time was Horace Gray.  He was\r\nin the class before me at Harvard, though considerably younger.\r\nI knew him by sight only in those days.  He was very tall,\r\nwith an exceedingly youthful countenance, and a head that\r\nlooked then rather small of so large-limbed a youth--rather\r\nawkward in his gait and bearing.  But after he reached manhood\r\nhe grew into one of the finest-looking men of his time.  I\r\nbelieve he was the tallest man in Boston.  He expanded in\r\nevery way to a figure which corresponded to his stately height.\r\nHe was the grandson of the famous William Gray, the great\r\nmerchant and ship-owner of New England, who was an important\r\nfigure in the days just preceding and just following the War\r\nof 1812.  Many anecdotes are still current of his wise and\r\nracy sayings.  His sons inherited large fortunes and were\r\nall of them men of mark and influence in Boston.  Francis\r\nC. Grey, the Judge's uncle, was a man of letters, a historical\r\ninvestigator.  He discovered the priceless Body of Liberties\r\nof 1641, which had remained unprinted from that time, although\r\nthe source from which our Bill of Rights and constitutional\r\nprovisions had been so largely drawn.\r\n\r\nJudge Gray's father was largely employed in manufacturing\r\nand owned some large iron works.  The son had been brought\r\nup, I suppose, to expect that his life would be one of comfort\r\nand ease, free from all anxieties about money, and the extent\r\nof the labor of life would be, perhaps, to visit the counting-\r\nroom a few hours in the day to look over the books and see\r\ngenerally that his affairs were properly conducted by his\r\nagents and subordinates.  He had visited Europe more than\r\nonce, and was abroad shortly after his graduation when the\r\nnews reached him that the companies in which his father's\r\nfortune was invested had failed.  He at once hurried home\r\nand set himself resolutely to work to take care of himself.\r\nHe was an accomplished naturalist for his age and time, and\r\nhad a considerable library of works on natural history.  He\r\nexchanged them for law-books and entered the Law School.  I\r\nwas splitting wood to make my own fire one autumn morning\r\nwhen my door, which was ajar, was pushed open, and I saw a\r\nface somewhere up in the neighborhood of the transom.  It\r\nwas Gray, who had come to inquire what it was all about.  He\r\nhad little knowledge of the rules or fashions of the Law School.\r\nI told him about the scheme of instruction and the hours of\r\nlectures, and so forth.  We became fast friends, a friendship\r\nmaintained to his death.  He at once manifested a very vigorous\r\nintellect and a memory, not only for legal principles, but for\r\nthe names of cases, which I suppose had been cultivated by\r\nhis studies in natural history and learning the scientific\r\nnames of birds and plants.  At any rate, he became one of\r\nthe best pupils in the Law School.  He afterward studied\r\nlaw with Edward D. Sohier, and immediately after his admission\r\nbecame known as one of the most promising young men at the\r\nBar.  Luther S. Cushing was then Reporter of the decisions\r\nof the Supreme Court.  He was in poor health and employed\r\nGray to represent him as Reporter on the Circuit.  Gray always\r\nhad a marvellous gift of remembering just where a decision\r\nof principle of law could be found, and his thumb and forefinger\r\nwould travel instantly to the right book on the obscurest\r\nshelf in a Law Library.  So nothing seemed to escape his thorough\r\nand indefatigable research.  When he was on the Circuit, learned\r\ncounsel would often be arguing some question of law for which\r\nthey had most industriously prepared, when the young Reporter\r\nwould hand them a law-book with a case in it which had escaped\r\ntheir research.  So the best lawyers all over the State got\r\nacquainted at an early day with his learning and industry, and\r\nwhen Cushing soon after was obliged to resign the office of\r\nReporter, Gray was appointed by the general consent of the\r\nbest men of the profession, although he had as a competition\r\nJudge Perkins, a very well known lawyer and Judge, who had\r\nedited some important law-books and was a man of mature age.\r\nThis was in 1854, only three years after his admission to\r\nthe Bar.  The office of Reporter was then one of the great\r\noffices of the State, almost equal in dignity to that of the\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court itself.  Four of our Massachusetts\r\nReporters have been raised to that Bench.  He was quite largely\r\nretained and employed during that period, especially in important\r\nquestions of commercial law.  He resigned his office of Reporter\r\nabout the time of the breaking out of the war.  Governor Andrew\r\ndepended upon his advice and guidance in some very important\r\nand novel questions of military law, and in 1864 he was appointed\r\nAssociate Justice of the Court.  In 1873 he became its Chief\r\nJustice, and in 1882 was made Associate Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States.  The extent of his learning and\r\nthe rapidity and thoroughness of his research were marvellous.\r\nBut it is not upon this alone, or chiefly, that his fame as\r\none of the great Judges of the world will rest.  He was a\r\nman of a native, original intellectual power, unsurpassed\r\nby any man who has been on the Bench in his time, either in\r\nthis country or in England.  His decisions have been as sound\r\nand as acceptable to the profession upon questions where no\r\nauthority could be found upon which to rest, and upon questions\r\noutside of the beaten paths of jurisprudence as upon those\r\nwhere he found aid in his great legal learning.  He was a\r\nremarkably acceptable _nisi-prius_ Judge, when holding court\r\nin the rural counties, and, though bred in a city, where human\r\nnature is not generally learned so well, he was especially\r\nfortunate and successful in dealing with questions of fact\r\nwhich grow out of the transactions of ordinary and humble\r\nlife in the country.  He manifested on one or two occasions\r\nthe gift of historical research and discussion for which his\r\nuncle Francis was so distinguished.\r\n\r\nIt was my sorrowful duty to preside at a meeting of the Bar\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States to express their\r\nsense of their great loss and that of the whole country,\r\nafter Gray's death.\r\n\r\nI add some extracts from the remarks which I made on that\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\nThe Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States come together\r\nto pay a tribute of honor to a great lawyer and Judge.  I\r\nshall have, I am sure, another opportunity to put on record\r\nmy own sense of the irreparable loss of a dear friend and\r\ncomrade of more than fifty years.  To-day we are to speak,\r\nas members of the Bar, of an honored Judge whom the inexorable\r\nshaft has stricken in his high place.\r\n\r\nHe was in his seat in the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nfor the last time Monday, February 3, 1902.  On the evening\r\nof that day he had a slight paralytic shock, which seriously\r\naffected his physical strength.  He retained his mental strength\r\nand activity unimpaired until just before his death.  On the\r\n9th day of July, 1902, he sent his resignation to the President,\r\nto take effect on the appointment and qualifying of his successor.\r\nSo, he died in office, September 15, 1902.\r\n\r\nOn his mother's side Judge Gray was the grandson of Jabez\r\nUpham, one of the great lawyers of the day, who died in 1811,\r\nat the age of forty-six, after a brief service in the National\r\nHouse of Representatives.  He was settled in Brookfield, Worcester\r\nCounty.  But the traditions of his great ability were fresh\r\nwhen I went there to live, nearly forty years after his death.\r\nThe memory of the beauty and sweetness and delightful accomplishment\r\nof Mr. Upham's daughter, Judge Gray's mother, who died in\r\nthe Judge's early youth, was still fragrant among the old\r\nmen and women who had been her companions.  She is mentioned\r\nrepeatedly in the letters of that accomplished Scotch lady\r\n--friend of Walter Scott and of so many of the English and\r\nScotch men of letters in her time--Mrs. Grant of Laggan.\r\nMrs. Grant says in a letter published in her Memoir:  \"My\r\nfailing memory represents my short intercourse with Mrs.\r\nGray as if some bright vision from a better world had come\r\nand, vanishing, left a trail behind.\"  In another letter she\r\nspeaks of the enchantment of Mrs. Gray's character: \"Anything\r\nso pure, so bright, so heavenly I have rarely met with.\"\r\n\r\nThe title, which the kindness of our countrymen has given\r\nto Massachusetts, that of Model Commonwealth, I think has\r\nbeen earned largely by the character of her Judiciary, and\r\nnever could have been acquired without it.  Among the great\r\nfigures that have adorned that Bench in the past, the figure\r\nof Justice Gray is among the most conspicuous and stately.\r\n\r\nJudge Gray has had from the beginning a reputation for wonderful\r\nresearch.  Nothing ever seemed to escape his industry and\r\nprofound learning.  This was shown on a few occasions when\r\nhe undertook some purely historical investigation, as in his\r\nnotes on the case of the Writs of Assistance, argued by James\r\nOtis and reported in Quincy's Reports, and his recent admirable\r\naddress at Richmond, on Chief Justice Marshall.  But while\r\nall his opinions are full of precedent and contain all the\r\nlearning of the case, he was, I think, equally remarkable\r\nfor the wisdom, good sense, and strength of his judgments.\r\nI do not think of any Judge of his time anywhere, either here\r\nor in England, to whom the profession would ascribe a higher\r\nplace if he be judged only by the correctness of his opinions\r\nin cases where there were no precedents on which to lean and\r\nfor the excellent original reasons which he had to give.  I\r\nthink Judge Gray's fame, on the whole, would have been greater\r\nas a man of original power if he had resisted, sometimes,\r\nthe temptation to marshal an array of cases, and had suffered\r\nhis judgments to stand on his statement of legal principles\r\nwithout the authorities.  He manifested another remarkable\r\nquality when he was on the Bench of Massachusetts.  He was\r\nan admirable _nisi-prius_ Judge.  I think we rarely have had\r\na better.  He possessed that faculty which made the jury,\r\nin the old days, so admirable a mechanism for performing their\r\npart in the administration of justice.  He had the rare gift,\r\nespecially rare in men whose training has been chiefly upon\r\nthe Bench, of discerning the truth of the fact, in spite of\r\nthe apparent weight of the evidence.  That Court, in his time,\r\nhad exclusive jurisdiction of divorces and other matters affecting\r\nthe marital relations.  The Judge had to hear and deal with\r\ntransactions of humble life and of country life.  It was surprising\r\nhow this man, bred in a city, in high social position, having\r\nno opportunity to know the modes of thought and of life of\r\npoor men and of rustics, would settle these interesting and\r\ndelicate questions, affecting so deeply the life of plain\r\nmen and country farmers, and with what unerring sagacity he\r\ncame to the wise and righteous result.\r\n\r\nJudge Gray's opinions for the eighteen years during which\r\nhe sat on the Bench of Massachusetts constitute an important\r\nbody of jurisprudence, from which the student can learn the\r\nwhole range of the law as it rests on principle and on authority.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass when the place of Mr. Justice Clifford\r\nbecame vacant that by the almost universal consent of the\r\nNew England Circuit, with the general approval of the profession\r\nthroughout the whole country, Mr. Justice Gray became his\r\nsuccessor.  Of his service here there are men better qualified\r\nto speak than I am.  He took his place easily among the great\r\nJudges of the world.  He has borne himself in his great office\r\nso, I believe, as to command the approbation of his countrymen\r\nof all sections and of all parties.  He has been every inch\r\na Judge.  He has maintained the dignity of his office everywhere.\r\nHe has endeared himself to a large circle of friends here\r\nat the National Capital by his elegant and gracious hospitality.\r\nHis life certainly has been fortunate.  The desire of his\r\nyouth has been fulfilled.  From the time, more than fifty\r\nyears ago, when he devoted himself to his profession, there\r\nhas been, I suppose, no moment when he did not regard the\r\noffice of a Justice of the Supreme Court as not only the most\r\nattractive but also the loftiest of human occupations.  He\r\nhas devoted himself to that with a single purpose.  He has\r\nsought no fame or popularity by any other path.  Certainly\r\nhis life has been fortunate.  It has lasted to a good old age.\r\nBut the summons came for him when his eye was not dimmed nor\r\nhis natural force abated.  He drank of the cup of the waters\r\nof life while it was sweetest and clearest, and was not left\r\nto drink it to the dregs.  He was fortunate also, almost beyond\r\nthe lot of humanity, in that by a rare felicity, the greatest\r\njoy of youth came to him in an advanced age.  Everything that\r\ncan make life honorable, everything that can make life happy--\r\nhonor, success, the consciousness of usefulness, the regard\r\nof his countrymen, and the supremest delight of family life--\r\nall were his.  His friends take leave of him as another of\r\nthe great and stately figures in the long and venerable procession\r\nof American Judges.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to Judge Wilde in seniority upon the Bench among the\r\nassociate Judges was Mr. Justice Charles A. Dewey of Northampton.\r\nHe had had a good deal of experience as a prosecuting attorney\r\nin a considerable general practice in the western part of\r\nthe State.  He was careful in his opinions never to go beyond\r\nwhat was necessary for the case at bar.  It is said that there\r\nis no instance that any opinion of his was ever overruled\r\nin a very long judicial service.\r\n\r\nJudge Dewey was a man of absolute integrity and faithful\r\nin the discharge of his judicial duty.  He had no sentiment\r\nand, so far as I ever knew, took little interest in matters\r\noutside of his important official duties.  He was very careful\r\nin the management of property.  When the Democrats were in\r\npower in Massachusetts in 1843 they reduced the salaries of\r\nthe Judges of the Supreme Court in violation of the Constitutional\r\nprovision.  Chief Justice Shaw refused to touch a dollar of\r\nhis salary until the Legislature the next year restored the\r\nold salary and provided for the payment of the arrears.  Judge\r\nDewey held out for one quarter.  But the next quarter he went\r\nquietly to the State House, drew his quarter's salary, went\r\ndown on to State Street and invested it, and did the same\r\nevery quarter thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the days of my early practice the Supreme Court used to\r\nsit in Worcester for about five or six weeks, beginning in\r\nApril.  It had exclusive jurisdiction of real actions, and\r\nlimited equity jurisdiction.  All suits where the matter in\r\nissue was more than three hundred dollars might be brought\r\noriginally in that court or removed there by the defendant\r\nfrom the Common Pleas if the plaintiff began it below.  So\r\nthe court had a great deal of business.  It also had jurisdiction\r\nof divorce cases, appeals from the Probate Court and some\r\nspecial writs such as habeas corpus, certiorari and mandamus.\r\nBut after all, the old Court of Common Pleas was the place\r\nwhere the greater part of the law business of the county was\r\ntransacted.  There were at first four civil terms in the year,\r\nand, after Fitchburg became a half shire, there were two more\r\nterms held there.  The Common Pleas had jurisdiction of all\r\ncrimes except capital.\r\n\r\nThere were some very interesting characters among the old\r\nJudges of the Common Pleas.  Among the most remarkable was\r\nJudge Edward Mellen, who was first side Judge and afterward\r\nChief Justice.  He was a man of great law-learning, indefatigable\r\nindustry and remarkable memory for cases, diffuse and long-\r\nwinded in his charges, and apt to take sides.  He took everything\r\nvery seriously.  It is said that he would listen to the most\r\npathetic tale of human suffering unmoved, but would burst\r\ninto tears at the mention of a stake and stones or two chestnut\r\nstaddles.\r\n\r\nMellen with the other Judges of the old Common Pleas Court\r\nwas legislated off the Bench by the abolition of that court\r\nin 1858.  He moved from Middlesex to Worcester and resumed\r\npractice, but was never largely employed.  He was a repository\r\nof the old stories of the Middlesex Bar, many of which died\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nA Lowell lawyer told me this story of Judge Mellen.  My informant\r\nhad in his office a law student who spent most of his time\r\nin reading novels and poetry and writing occasionally for\r\nthe newspapers.  He was anxious to get admitted to the Bar\r\nand had crammed for the examination.  In those days, unless\r\nthe applicant had studied three years, when he was admitted\r\nas of course, the Judge examined him himself.  The Judge was\r\nholding court at Concord, and an arrangement was made that\r\nthe youngster should go to the Judge's room in the evening\r\nand submit himself to the examination.  He kept the appointment,\r\nbut in about ten minutes came out.  My informant, who had\r\nrecommended him, asked him what was the matter.  He said he\r\ndidn't know.  The Judge had asked him one question only.  He\r\nwas sure he answered it right, but the Judge immediately dismissed\r\nhim with great displeasure.  The next morning the lawyer\r\nwent up to Judge Mellen in court and said, \"Judge, what was\r\nthe matter with the young man last night?  Did you not find\r\nhim fitted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fitted?\" said the Judge.  \"No sir.  I asked him what was\r\nthe rule in Shelley's Case, and he told me the rule in Shelley's\r\nCase was that when the father was an atheist the Lord Chancellor\r\nwould appoint a guardian for his children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" was the reply.  \"I see.  The trouble is that neither\r\nof you ever heard of the other's Shelley.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Byington of Stockbridge in Berkshire used to come to\r\nWorcester a great deal to hold the old Common Pleas Court.\r\nHe was an excellent lawyer and an excellent Judge--dry, fond\r\nof the common law, and of black letter authorities.  He had\r\na curious habit of giving his charge in one long sentence\r\nwithout periods, but with a great many parentheses.  But he\r\nhad great influence with the juries and was very sound and\r\ncorrect in his law.  I once tried a case before him for damages\r\nfor the seizure of a stock of liquors under the provisions\r\nof the Statute of 1852, known as the Maine Liquor Law, which\r\nhad been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  He began:\r\n\"The Statute of 1852 chapter so-and-so gentlemen of the jury\r\ncommonly known as the Maine Liquor Law which has created great\r\nfeeling throughout this Commonwealth some very good men were\r\nin favor of it and some very good men were against it read\r\nliterally part of it would be ridiculous and you may take\r\nyour seats if you please gentlemen of the jury I shall be\r\noccupied some time in my charge and I do not care to keep\r\nyou standing and some of it would be absurd and some of it\r\nreads very well.\" And so on.\r\n\r\nA neighbor of Judge Byington from Berkshire County was Judge\r\nHenry W. Bishop of Stockbridge.  He was an old Democratic\r\npolitician and at one time the candidate of his party for\r\nGovernor.  He was not a very learned lawyer, but was quick-\r\nwitted and picked up a good deal from the arguments of counsel.\r\nAided by a natural shrewdness and sense, he got along pretty\r\nwell.  He had a gift of rather bombastic speech.  His exuberant\r\neloquence was of a style more resembling that prevalent in\r\nsome other parts of the country than the more sober and severe\r\nfashion of New England.  Just before he came to the Bench\r\nhe was counsel in a real estate case in Springfield where\r\nMr. Chapman, afterward Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,\r\nwas on the other side.  The evidence of recent occupation\r\nand the monuments tended in favor of Chapman's client.  But\r\nit turned out that the one side had got a title under the\r\noriginal grant of the town of Blandford, and the other under\r\nthe original grant of an adjoining town, and that the town\r\nline had been maintained from the beginning where Bishop claimed\r\nthe true line to be.  When he came to that part of the case,\r\nhe rose mightily in his stirrups.  Turning upon Chapman, who\r\nwas a quiet, mild-mannered old gentleman, he said: \"The gentleman's\r\neyes may twinkle like Castor and Pollux, twin stars; but he\r\ncan't wink out of sight that town line of Blandford.  He may\r\nplace one foot on Orion and the other on Arcturus, and seize\r\nthe Pleiades by the hair and wring all the water from their\r\ndripping urns; but he can't wash out that town line of Blandford.\"\r\nThe local newspaper got hold of the speech and reported it,\r\nand it used to be spoken occasionally by the school boys for\r\ntheir declamation.  Bishop is said to have been much disturbed\r\nby the ridicule it created, and to have refused ever to go to\r\nSpringfield again on any professional employment.\r\n\r\nJudge Aldrich was appointed to the Bench of the Superior\r\nCourt of Massachusetts by Governor William B. Washburn after\r\nI left the practice of law for public life.  I appeared before\r\nhim in a very few cases and must take his judicial quality\r\nlargely from the report of others.  He was a very powerful\r\nand formidable advocate, especially in cases where moral principles\r\nor the family relations were concerned, or where any element\r\nof pathos enabled him to appeal to the jury.  The most tedious\r\nhours of my life, I think, have been those when I was for\r\nthe defendant and he for the plaintiff, and I had to sit and\r\nlisten to his closing argument in reply to mine.  He had a\r\ngift of simple eloquence; the influence with juries which\r\ncomes from earnestness and the profound conviction of the\r\nrighteousness of the cause he had advocated, and the weight\r\nof an unsullied personal character and unquestioned integrity.\r\n\r\nMr. Aldrich's appointment to the Bench came rather late in\r\nhis life, so he was not promoted to the Supreme Court, which\r\nwould undoubtedly have happened if he had been younger.  He\r\nwas an excellent magistrate and the author of one or two valuable\r\nlaw books.  Although my chief memories of him are of the many\r\noccasions on which I have crossed swords with him, and of\r\nbattles when our feelings and sympathy were profoundly stirred,\r\nstill they are of the most affectionate character.  He had\r\na quick temper and was easily moved to anger in the trial\r\nof a case.  But as an eminent western Judge is reported to\r\nhave said in speaking of some offence that had been committed\r\nat the Bar, \"This Court herself are naterally quick-tempered.\"\r\nSo the sparks of our quarrels went out as quickly as they\r\nwere kindled.  I think of P. Emory Aldrich as a stanch and\r\nconstant friend, from whom, so long as his life lasted, I received\r\nnothing but friendliest sympathy and constant and powerful\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nJudge Aldrich, as I just said, was a man of quick temper.\r\nHe was ready to accept any challenge to a battle, especially\r\none which seemed to have anything of a personal disrespect\r\nin it.  I was present on one occasion when the ludicrous\r\nmisspelling of a word, it is very likely, saved him from coming\r\nto blows with a very worthy and well-known citizen of Worcester\r\nCounty.  Colonel Artemus Lee, of Templeton, one of the most\r\nestimable citizens of northern Worcester County, a man imperious\r\nand quick-tempered, who had been apt to have his own way in\r\nthe region where he dwelt, and not very willing to give up\r\nto anybody, employed me once to bring suit for him against\r\nthe Town of Templeton to recover taxes which he claimed had\r\nbeen illegally assessed and collected.  He was a man whose\r\nspelling had been neglected in early youth.  Aldrich was for\r\nthe Town.  All the facts showing the illegality of the assessment,\r\nof course, were upon the Town records.  So we thought if the\r\nparties met with their counsel we could agree upon a statement\r\nof facts and submit the question of law to the court.  We\r\nmet in Judge Aldrich's office, Colonel Lee and myself and\r\nJudge Aldrich and some of the Town officers, to make up the\r\nstatement.  But Mr. Aldrich had not had time to look very\r\ndeeply into the law of the case, and made some difficulties in\r\nagreeing upon the facts, which we thought rather unreasonable.\r\nWe sat up to a late hour in a hot summer evening trying to\r\nget at a statement.  At last Lee's patience gave out.  He\r\nhad had one or two hot passages at arms with Mr. Aldrich\r\nin the course of the discussion already.  He rose to his feet\r\nand said in a very loud and angry tone--his voice was always\r\nsomething like that of a bull of Basham--\"This is a farce.\"\r\nAldrich rose from his seat and to the occasion and said very\r\nangrily, \"What's that you say, Sir?\" Lee clenched both fists\r\nby his side, thrust his own angry countenance close up to\r\nthat of his antagonist, and said, \"A farce, Sir--F-A-R-S-\r\nE, Farce.\"  Aldrich caught my eye as I was sitting behind\r\nmy client and noticed my look of infinite amusement.  His\r\nanger yielded to the comedy of the occasion.  He burst into\r\na roar of laughter and peace was saved.  If Lee had spelled\r\nthe word farce with a \"c,\" there would have been a battle\r\nroyal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\nPOLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS FAITH\r\n\r\nI close this book with a statement of the political principles\r\nwhich I think define the duty of the American people in the\r\nnear future, and from which I hope the Republic will not depart\r\nuntil time shall be no more; and of the simple religious faith\r\nin which I was bred, and to which I now hold.\r\n\r\nThey cannot to my mind be separated.  One will be found in\r\nsome resolutions offered in the Senate December 20, 1899.\r\nThe other in what I said on taking the chair at the National\r\nUnitarian Conference, at Washington, in October 1899.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hoar submitted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS the American people and the several States in the\r\nUnion have in times past, at important periods in their history,\r\nespecially when declaring their Independence, establishing\r\ntheir Constitutions, or undertaking new and great responsibilities,\r\nseen fit to declare the purposes for which the Nation or State\r\nwas founded and the important objects the people intend to\r\npursue in their political action; and\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS the close of a great war, the liberation by the\r\nUnited States of the people of Cuba and Porto Rico in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere and of the Philippine Islands in the far\r\nEast, and the reduction of those peoples to a condition of\r\npractical dependence upon the United States, constitute an\r\noccasion which makes such a declaration proper;  Therefore,\r\nbe it\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That this Republic adheres to the doctrines\r\nwhich were in the past set forth in the Declaration of Independence\r\nand in its National and State constitutions.\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That the purpose of its existence and the objects\r\nto which its political action ought to be directed are the\r\nennobling of humanity, the raising from the dust its humblest\r\nand coarsest members, and the enabling of persons coming lawfully\r\nunder its power or influence to live in freedom and in honor\r\nunder governments in whose forms they are to have a share\r\nin determining and in whose administration they have an equal\r\nvoice.  Its most important and pressing obligations are:\r\n\r\n\"First.  To solve the difficult problem presented by the\r\npresence of different races on our own soil with equal Constitutional\r\nrights; to make the Negro safe in his home, secure in his\r\nvote, equal in his opportunity for education and employment,\r\nand to bring the Indian to a civilization and culture in accordance\r\nwith his need and capacity.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  To enable great cities to govern themselves in\r\nfreedom, in honor, and in purity.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  To make the ballot box as pure as a sacramental\r\nvessel, and the election return as perfect in accord with\r\nthe law and the truth as a judgment of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth.  To banish illiteracy and ignorance from the land.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth.  To secure for every workman and for every working\r\nwoman wages enough to support a life of comfort and an old\r\nage of leisure and quiet, as befits those who have an equal\r\nshare in a self-governing State.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth.  To grow and expand over the continent and over the\r\nislands of the sea just so fast, and no faster, as we can\r\nbring into equality and self-government under our Constitution\r\npeoples and races who will share these ideals and help to\r\nmake them realities.\r\n\r\n\"Seventh.  To set a peaceful example of freedom which mankind\r\nwill be glad to follow, but never to force even freedom upon\r\nunwilling nations at the point of the bayonet or at the cannon's\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Eighth.  To abstain from interfering with the freedom and\r\njust rights of other nations or peoples, and to remember\r\nthat the liberty to do right necessarily involves the liberty\r\nto do wrong; and that the American people has no right to\r\ntake from any other people the birthright of freedom because\r\nof a fear that they will do wrong with it.\"\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON TAKING THE CHAIR AT THE NATIONAL UNITARIAN\r\n  CONFERENCE, IN WASHINGTON, OCTOBER, 1899\r\n\r\n\"The part assigned to me, in the printed plan of our proceedings,\r\nis the delightful duty of bidding you welcome.  But you find\r\na welcome from each other in the glance of the eye, in the\r\npressure of the hand, in the glad tone of the voice, better\r\nthan any that can be put into formal words.\r\n\r\n  From hand to hand the greeting goes;\r\n  From eye to eye the signals run;\r\n  From heart to heart to bright hope glows;\r\n  The seekers of the light are one.\r\n\r\nEvery Unitarian, man and woman, every lover of God or His\r\nSon, every one who in loving his fellow-men loves God and\r\nHis Son, even without knowing it, is welcome in this company.\r\n\r\n\"We are sometimes told, as if it were a reproach, that we\r\ncannot define Unitarianism.  For myself, I thank God that\r\nit is not to be defined.  To define is to bound, to enclose, to\r\nset limit.  The great things of the universe are not to be\r\ndefined.  You cannot define a human soul.  You cannot define\r\nthe intellect.  You cannot define immortality or eternity.\r\nYou cannot define God.\r\n\r\n\"I think, also, that the things we are to be glad of and to\r\nbe proud of and are to be thankful for are not those things\r\nthat separate us from the great body of Christians or the\r\ngreat body of believers in God and in righteousness, but in\r\nthe things that unite us with them.  No Five Points, no Athanasian\r\nCreed, no Thirty-nine Articles, separate the men and women\r\nof our way of thinking from humanity or from Divinity.\r\n\r\n\"But still, although we do not define Unitarianism, we know\r\nour own when we see them.  There are men and women who like\r\nto be called by our name.  There are men and women for whom\r\nFaith, Hope, and Charity forever abide; to whom Judea's news\r\nare still glad tidings; who believe that one day Jesus Christ\r\ncame to this earth, bearing a Divine message and giving a\r\nDivine example.  There are women who bear their own sorrows\r\nof life by soothing the sorrows of others; youths who, when\r\nDuty whispers low, 'Thou must,' reply, \"I can'; and old men\r\nto whom the experience of life has taught the same brave lesson;\r\nexamples of the patriotism that will give its life for its\r\ncountry when in the right, and the patriotism that will make\r\nitself of no reputation, if need be, to save its country from\r\nbeing in the wrong.\r\n\r\n\"They do not comprehend the metaphysics of a Trinal Unity,\r\nnor how it is just that innocence should be punished, that\r\nguilt may go free.  They do not attribute any magic virtue\r\nto the laying on of hands; nor do they believe that the traces\r\nof an evil life in the soul can be washed out by the sprinkling\r\nof a few drops of water, however pure, or by baptism in any\r\nblood, however innocent, in the hour of death.  But they do\r\nunderstand the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and they\r\nknow and they love and they practise the great virtues which\r\nthe Apostle tells us are to abide.\r\n\r\n\"I think there can be found in this country no sectarianism\r\nso narrow, so hide-bound, so dogma-clad, that it would like\r\nto blot out from the history of the country what the men of\r\nour faith have contributed to it.  On the first roll of this\r\nWashington parish will be found close together the names of\r\nJohn C. Calhoun and John Quincy Adams.  John Quincy Adams\r\nhad learned from his father and mother the liberal Christian\r\nfaith he transmitted to his illustrious son.  If we would\r\nblot out Unitarianism from the history of the country, we\r\nmust erase the names of many famous statesmen, many famous\r\nphilanthropists, many great reformers, many great orators,\r\nmany famous soldiers, from its annals, and nearly all of our\r\ngreat poets from its literature.\r\n\r\n\"I could exhaust not only the time I have a right to take,\r\nbut I could fill a week if I were to recall their names and\r\ntell the story of their lives.  Still less could I speak\r\nadequately of the men and women who, in almost every neighborhood\r\nthroughout the country, have found in this Unitarian faith\r\nof ours a stimulant to brave and noble lives and a sufficient\r\ncomfort and support in the hour of a brave death.  As I stand\r\nhere on this occasion, my heart is full of one memory,--of\r\none who loved our Unitarian faith with the whole fervor of\r\nhis soul, who in his glorious prime, possessing everything\r\nwhich could make life happy and precious, the love of wife\r\nand children and friends, the joy of professional success,\r\nthe favor of his fellow-citizens, the fulness of health, the\r\nconsciousness of high talent, heard the voice of the Lord\r\nspeaking from the fever-haunted hospital and the tropical\r\nswamp, and the evening dews and damps, saying, 'Where is the\r\nmessenger that will take his life in his hand, that I may\r\nsend him to carry health to my stricken soldiers and sailors?'\r\nWhen the Lord said, 'Whom shall I send?' he answered, 'Here\r\nam I:  send me.'*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Sherman Hoar, who after a brilliant public and professional career,\r\ngave his life to his country by exposure in caring for the sick soldiers\r\nof the Spanish war.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\n\"The difference between Christian sects, like the difference\r\nbetween individual Christians, is not so much in the matter\r\nof belief or disbelief of portions of the doctrine of the Scripture\r\nas in the matter of _emphasis._  It is a special quality\r\nand characteristic of Unitarianism that Unitarians everywhere\r\nlay special emphasis upon the virtue of Hope.  It was said\r\nof Cromwell by his secretary that hope shone in him like a\r\nfiery pillar when it had gone out in every other.\r\n\r\n\"There are two great texts in the Scripture in whose sublime\r\nphrases are contained the germs of all religion, whether\r\nnatural or revealed.  They lay hold on two eternities.  One\r\nrelates to Deity in his solitude--'Before Abraham was, I\r\nam.'  The other is for the future.  It sums up the whole\r\nduty and the whole destiny of man:  'And now abideth Faith,\r\nHope, and Charity,--these three.'  If Faith, Hope, and Charity\r\nabide, then Humanity abides.  Faith is for beings without\r\nthe certainty of omniscience.  Hope is for beings without\r\nthe strength of omnipotence.  And Charity, as the apostle\r\ndescribes it, affects the relations of beings limited and\r\nimperfect to one another.\r\n\r\n\"Why is it that this Christian virtue of Hope is placed as\r\nthe central figure of the sublime group who are to accompany\r\nthe children of God through their unending life?  It is because\r\nwithout it Faith would be impossible and Charity would be\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\n\"Hope is that attribute of the soul which believes in the\r\nfinal triumph of righteousness.  It has no place in a theology\r\nwhich believes in the final perdition of the larger number\r\nof mankind.  Mighty Jonathan Edwards,--the only genius since\r\nDante akin to Dante,--could you not see that, if your world\r\nexist where there is no hope and where there is no love, there\r\ncan be no faith?  Who can trust the promise of a God who has\r\ncreated a Universe and peopled it with fiends? The Apostle\r\nof your doleful gospel must preach quite another Evangel:\r\nAnd now abideth Hate, and now abideth Wrath, and now abideth\r\nDespair, and now abideth Woe unutterable.  With Hope, as we\r\nhave defined it,--namely, the confident expectation of the\r\nfinal triumph of righteousness,--we are but a little lower\r\nthan the angels; without it we are but a kind of vermin.\r\n\r\n\"The literature of free countries is full of cheer:  the story\r\nends happily.  The fiction of despotic countries is hopeless.\r\nPeople of free countries will not tolerate a fiction which\r\nteaches that in the end evil is triumphant and virtue is\r\nwretched.  Want of hope means either distrust of God or a\r\nbelief in the essential baseness of man or both.  It teaches\r\nmen to be base.  It makes a country base.  A world wherein\r\nthere is no hope is a world where there is no virtue.  The\r\ncontrast between the teacher of hope and the teacher of despair\r\nis to be found in the pessimism of Carlyle and the serene\r\ncheerfulness of Emerson.  Granting to the genius of Carlyle\r\neverything that is claimed for it, I believe that his chief\r\ntitle hereafter to respect as a moral teacher will be found\r\nin Emerson's certificate.\r\n\r\n\"But I must not detain you any longer from the business which\r\nwaits for this convention.  It is the last time that I shall\r\nenjoy the great privilege and honor of occupying this chair.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I may be pardoned, as I have said something of the\r\nreligious faith of my fellow Unitarians, if I declare my\r\nown, which I believe is theirs also.  I have no faith in fatalism,\r\nin destiny, in blind force.  I believe in God, the living\r\nGod, in the American people, a free and brave people, who\r\ndo not bow the neck or bend the knee to any other, and who\r\ndesire no other to bow the neck or bend the knee to them.\r\nI believe that the God who created this world has ordained\r\nthat his children may work out their own salvation and that\r\nhis nations may work out their own salvation by obedience\r\nto his laws without any dictation or coercion from any other.\r\nI believe that liberty, good government, free institutions,\r\ncannot be given by any one people to any other, but must\r\nbe wrought out for each by itself, slowly, painfully, in the\r\nprocess of years or centuries, as the oak adds ring to ring.\r\nI believe that a Republic is greater than an Empire.  I believe\r\nthat the moral law and the Golden Rule are for nations as\r\nwell as for individuals.  I believe in George Washington,\r\nnot in Napoleon Bonaparte; in the Whigs of the Revolutionary\r\nday, not in the Tories; the Chatham, Burke, and Sam Adams,\r\nnot in Dr. Johnson or Lord North.  I believe that the North\r\nStar, abiding in its place, is a greater influence in the\r\nUniverse than any comet or meteor.  I believe that the United\r\nStates when President McKinley was inaugurated was a greater\r\nworld power than Rome in the height of her glory or even England\r\nwith her 400,000,000 vassals.  I believe, finally, whatever\r\nclouds may darken the horizon, that the world is growing better,\r\nthat to-day is better than yesterday, and to-morrow will be\r\nbetter than to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\nEDWARD EVERETT HALE\r\n\r\nTo give a complete and truthful account of my own life, the\r\nname of Edward Everett Hale should appear on almost every\r\npage.  I became a member of his parish in Worcester in August,\r\n1849.  Wherever I have been, or wherever he has been, I have\r\nbeen his parishioner ever since.  I do not undertake to speak\r\nof him at length not only because he is alive, but because\r\nhis countrymen know him through and through, almost as well\r\nas I do.\r\n\r\nHe has done work of the first quality in a great variety\r\nof fields.  In each he has done work enough to fill the life\r\nand to fill the measure of fame of a busy and successful man.\r\nI have learned of him the great virtue of Hope; to judge\r\nof mankind by their merits and not their faults; to understand\r\nthat the great currents of history, especially in a republic,\r\nmore especially in our Republic, are determined by great and\r\nnoble motives and not by mean and base motives.\r\n\r\nIn his very best work Dr. Hale seems always to be doing and\r\nsaying what he does and says extempore, without premeditation.\r\nWhere he gets the time to acquire his vast stores of knowledge,\r\nor to think the thoughts we all like to hear, nobody can tell.\r\nWhen he speaks or preaches or writes, he opens his intellectual\r\nbox and takes the first appropriate thing that comes to hand.\r\n\r\nI do not believe we have a more trustworthy historian than\r\nDr. Hale, so far as giving us the motive and pith and essence\r\nof great transactions.  He is sometimes criticised for inaccuracy\r\nin dates or matters that are trifling or incidental.  I suppose\r\nthat comes from the fact that while he stores away in his\r\nmind everything that is essential, and trusts to his memory\r\nfor that, he has not the time, which less busy men have, to\r\nverify every unsubstantial detail before he speaks or writes.\r\nSir Thomas Browne put on record his opinion of such critics\r\nin the \"Christian Morals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quotation mistakes, inadvertency, expedition and human Lapses,\r\nmay make not only Moles but Warts in learned Authors, who\r\nnotwithstanding, being judged by the capital matter, admit\r\nnot of disparagement.  I should unwillingly affirm that Cicero\r\nwas but slightly versed in Homer, because in his Work _De\r\nGloria_ he ascribed those verses unto Ajax, which were delivered\r\nby Hector.  Capital Truths are to be narrowly eyed, collateral\r\nLapses and circumstantial deliveries not to be too strictly\r\nsifted.  And if the substantial subject be well forged out,\r\nwe need not examine the sparks which irregularly fly from\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Hale was eighty years old, his countrymen manifested\r\ntheir affection for him in a manner which I think no other\r\nliving man could have commanded.  It was my great privilege\r\nto be asked to say to him what all men were thinking, at a\r\ngreat meeting in Boston.  The large and beautiful hall was\r\nthronged with a very small portion of his friends.  If they\r\nhad all gathered, the City itself would have been thronged.\r\nI am glad to associate my name with that of my beloved teacher\r\nand friend by preserving here what I said.  It is a feeble\r\nand inadequate tribute.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States spoke for the whole country\r\nin the message which he sent:\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, Mar. 25, 1902.\r\n\r\n_My dear Sen. Hoar:_  I very earnestly wish I could be at\r\nthe meeting over which you are to preside in honor of the\r\neightieth birthday of Edward Everett Hale.  A classical allusion\r\nor comparison is always very trite; but I suppose all of us\r\nwho have read the simpler classical books think of Timoleon\r\nin his last days at Syracuse, loved and honored in his old\r\nage by the fellow citizens in whose service he had spent the\r\nstrength of his best years, as one of the noblest and most\r\nattractive figures in all history.  Dr. Hale is just such\r\na figure now.\r\n\r\nWe love him and we revere him.  We are prouder of our citizenship\r\nbecause he is our fellow citizen; and we feel that his life\r\nand his writing, both alike, spur us steadily to fresh effort\r\ntoward high thinking and right living.  To have written \"The\r\nMan Without a Country\" by itself would be quite enough to\r\nmake all the nation his debtor.  I belong to the innumerable\r\narmy of those who owe him much, and through you I wish him\r\nGodspeed now.\r\n\r\n  Ever faithfully yours,\r\n  THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nI spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"If I try to say all that is in my heart to-night, I do not\r\nknow where to begin.  If I try to say all that is in your\r\nhearts, or in the hearts of his countrymen, I do not know\r\nwhere to leave off.  Yet I can only say what everybody here\r\nis silently saying to himself.  When one of your kindred\r\nor neighbors comes to be eighty years old, after a useful and\r\nhonored life, especially if he be still in the vigor of manly\r\nstrength, his eye not dim or his natural force abated, his\r\nchildren and his friends like to gather at his dwelling in his\r\nhonor, and tell him the story of their gratitude and love.\r\nThey do not care about words.  It is enough if there be pressure\r\nof the hand and a kindly and loving glance of the eye.  That\r\nis all we can do now.  But the trouble is to know how to do\r\nit when a man's friends and lovers and spiritual children\r\nare to be counted by the millions.  I suppose if all the people\r\nin this country, and, indeed in all the quarters of the globe,\r\nwho would like to tell their gratitude to Dr. Hale, were\r\nto come together to do it, Boston Common would not hold them.\r\n\r\n\"There is once in a while, through the quality is rare, an\r\nauthor, a historian, or a writer of fiction, or a preacher, or a\r\npastor, or an orator or poet, or an influential or beloved\r\ncitizen, who in everything he says or does seems to be sending\r\na personal message from himself.  The message is inspired\r\nand tinctured and charged and made electric with the quality\r\nof the individual soul.  We know where it comes from.  No\r\nmask, no shrinking modesty can hide the individuality.  Every\r\nman knows from whom it comes, and hails it as a special message\r\nto himself.  We say, That is from my friend to me! The message\r\nmay be read by a million eyes and reach a million souls.  But\r\nevery one deems it private and confidential to him.\r\n\r\n\"This is only, when you come to think of it, carrying the\r\ngenius for private and personal friendship into the man's\r\ndealing with mankind.  I have never known anybody in all\r\nmy long life who seemed to me to be joined by the heart-\r\nstrings with so many men and women, wherever he goes, as\r\nDr. Hale.  I know in Worcester, where he used to live; I\r\nknow in Washington, where he comes too seldom, and where\r\nfor the last thirty-three years I have gone too often, poor\r\nwomen, men whose lives have gone wrong, or who are crippled\r\nin body or in mind, whose eyes watch for Dr. Hale's coming\r\nand going, and seem to make his coming and going, if they\r\nget a glimpse of him, the event they date from till he comes\r\nagain.  To me and my little household there, in which we never\r\ncount more than two or three, his coming is the event of every\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hale has not been the founder of a sect.  He has never\r\nbeen a builder of partition walls.  He has helped throw down\r\na good many.  But still, without making proclamation, he has\r\nbeen the founder of a school which has enlarged and broadened\r\nthe Church into the Congregation, and which has brought the\r\nwhole Congregation into the Church.\r\n\r\n\"When he came, hardly out of his boyhood, to our little parish\r\nin Worcester, there was, so far as I know, no Congregational\r\nchurch in the country whether Unitarian or of the ancient\r\nCalvinistic faith, which did not require a special vote and\r\nceremonial of admission to entitle any man to unite with his\r\nbrethren in commemorating the Saviour as he desired his friends\r\nand brethren to remember him by the rite of the last supper.\r\nUntil then, the Christian communion was but for a favored\r\nfew.  Mr. Hale believed that the greater the sinfulness of\r\nthe individual soul the greater the need and the greater the\r\ntitle to be taken into the fellowship and the brotherhood\r\nof the Saviour of souls.  So, without polemical discussion,\r\nor any heat of controversy, he set the example which has been\r\nso widely followed.  This meant a great deal more than the\r\nabolition of a ceremonial or the change of a rubric.  It was\r\nan assertion of the great doctrine, never till of late perfectly\r\ncomprehended anywhere, that the Saviour of men came into the\r\nworld inspired by the love of sinners, and not for an elect\r\nand an exclusive brotherhood of saints.\r\n\r\n\"We are not thinking chiefly of another world when we think\r\nof Dr. Hale or when we listen to him.  He has been telling\r\nus all his life that what the theologians call two worlds\r\nare but one; that the Kingdom of God is here, within and around\r\nyou; that there is but one Universe and not two; that the\r\nrelation of man to God is that of father and child, not of\r\nmaster and slave, or even of sovereign and subject; that when\r\nman wields any of the great forces of the Universe, it is\r\nGod also who is wielding them through him; that the power\r\nof a good man is one of God's powers, and that when man is\r\ndoing his work faithfully the supreme power of God's omnipotence\r\nis with him.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hale has done a good many things in his own matchless\r\nfashion.  He would have left a remarkable name and fame behind\r\nhim if he had been nothing but a student and narrator of history,\r\nas he has studied and told it; if he had been nothing but\r\na writer of fiction--the author of 'The Man Without a Country,'\r\nor 'Ten Times One is Ten,' or 'In His Name'--if he had done\r\nnothing but organize the Lend a Hand clubs, now found in the\r\nfour quarters of the world; if he had been nothing but an\r\neloquent Christian preacher; if he had been nothing but a\r\nbeloved pastor; if he had been only a voice which lifted to\r\nheaven in prayer the souls of great congregations; if he had\r\nbeen only a public-spirited citizen, active and powerful in\r\nevery good word and work for the benefit of this people; it\r\nhe had been only the man who devised the plan that might have\r\nsaved Texas from slavery, and thereby prevented the Civil\r\nWar, and which did thereafter save Kansas; if he had been\r\nonly remembered as the spiritual friend and comforter of large\r\nnumbers of men and women who were desolate and stricken by\r\npoverty and sorrow; if he had been only a zealous lover of\r\nhis country, comprehending, as scarcely any other man has\r\ncomprehended, the true spirit of the American people; if he\r\nhad been any one of these things, as he has been, it would\r\nbe enough to satisfy the most generous aspiration of any man,\r\nenough to make his life worth living for himself and his race.\r\nAnd yet, and yet, do I exaggerate one particle, when I say\r\nthat Dr. Hale has been all these, and more?\r\n\r\n\"Edward Everett Hale has been the interpreter of a pure,\r\nsimple loving and living faith to thousands and thousands\r\nof souls.  He has taught us that the fatherhood and tenderness\r\nof God are manifested here and now in this world, as they\r\nwill be hereafter; that the religion of Christ is a religion\r\nof daily living; that salvation is the purifying of the soul\r\nfrom sin, not its escape from the consequences of sin.  He\r\nis the representative and the incarnation of the best and\r\nloftiest Americanism.  He knows the history of his country,\r\nand knows his countrymen through and through.  He does not\r\nfancy that he loves his country, while he dislikes and despises\r\nhis countrymen and everything they have done and are doing.\r\nThe history he loves and has helped to write and to make is\r\nnot the history of a base and mean people, who have drifted\r\nby accident into empire.  It is the history of such a nation\r\nas Milton conceived, led and guided by men whom Milton would\r\nhave loved.  He will have a high and a permanent place in\r\nliterature, which none but Defoe shares.  He possesses the\r\ntwo rarest of gifts, that to give history the fascination\r\nof fiction, and that to give fiction the verisimilitude of\r\nhistory.  He has been the minister of comfort in sorrow and\r\nof joy in common life to countless persons to whom his friendship\r\nis among their most precious blessings, or by whose fireside\r\nhe sits, personally unknown, yet a perpetual and welcome guest.\r\n\r\n\"Still, the first duty of every man is to his own family.\r\nHe may be a warrior or a statesman, or reformer, or philanthropist,\r\nor prophet or poet, if he careth not first for his own household,\r\nhe is worse than an infidel.  So the first duty of a Christian\r\nminister is still that of a pastor to his own flock.  You\r\nknow better than I do how it has been here in Boston; but\r\nevery one of our little parish in Worcester, man or woman,\r\nboy or girl, has felt from the first time he or she knew him,\r\never afterward, that Dr. Hale has been taking hold of his\r\nhand.  That warmth and that pressure abide through all our\r\nlives, and will abide to the end.  There are countless persons\r\nwho never saw his face, who still deem themselves his obedient,\r\nloving and perpetual parishioners.\r\n\r\n\"I knew very well a beautiful woman, left widowed, and childless,\r\nand solitary, and forlorn, to whom, after every other consolation\r\nseemed to have failed to awake her from her sorrow and despair,\r\na friend of her own sex said:  'I thought you were one of\r\nEdward Hale's girls.'  The appeal touched the right chord\r\nand brought her back again to her life of courage and Christian\r\nwell-doing.\r\n\r\n\"He has ever been a prophet of good hope and a preacher of\r\ngood cheer.  When you have listened to one of his sermons,\r\nyou have listened to an evangel, to good tidings.  He has\r\nnever stood aloof from the great battles for righteousness\r\nor justice.  When men were engaged in the struggle to elevate\r\nthe race for the good of their fellow men, no word of discouragement\r\nhas ever come from his lips.  He has recalled no memory of\r\nold failure in the past.  He has never been found outside\r\nthe ranks railing at or criticising the men who were doing\r\nthe best work, or were doing the best work they knew how to\r\ndo.  He has never been afraid to tackle the evils that other\r\nmen think hopeless.  He has uttered his brave challenge to\r\nfoemen worthy of his steel.  Poverty and war and crime and\r\nsorrow are the enemies with whom he has striven.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know another living man who has exercised a more\r\npowerful influence on the practical life of his generation.\r\nHe has taught us the truth, very simple, but somehow nobody\r\never got hold of it till he did, that virtue and brave living,\r\nand helping other men, can be made to grow by geometrical\r\nprogression.  I am told that Dr. Hale has more correspondents\r\nin Asia than the London _Times._  I cannot tell how many persons\r\nare enrolled in the clubs of which he was the founder and\r\ninspirer.\r\n\r\n\"But I am disqualified to do justice to the theme you have\r\nassigned to me.  For an impartial verdict you must get an\r\nimpartial juryman.  You will have to find somebody that loves\r\nhim less than I do.  You cannot find anybody who loves him\r\nmore.  To me he has been a friend and father and brother and\r\ncounsellor and companion and leader and instructor; prophet\r\nof good hope, teacher of good cheer.  His figure mingles with\r\nmy household life, and with the life of my country.  I can\r\nhardly imagine either without him.  He has pictured for us\r\nthe infinite desolation of the man without a country.  But\r\nwhen his time shall come, what will be the desolation of the\r\ncountry without the man?\r\n\r\n\"And now what can we give you who have given us so much? We\r\nhave something to give you on our side.  We bring you a more\r\ncostly and precious gift than any jewel or diadem, though\r\nit came from an Emperor's treasury.\r\n\r\n  Love is a present for a mighty King.\r\n\r\n\"We bring you the heart's love of Boston where you were born,\r\nand Worcester where you took the early vows you have kept\r\nso well; of Massachusetts who knows she has no worthier son,\r\nand of the great and free country to whom you have taught\r\nnew lessons of patriotism, and whom you have served in a thousand\r\nways.\r\n\r\n\"This prophet is honored in his own country.  There will\r\nbe a place found for him somewhere in the House of many Mansions.\r\nI do not know what will be the employment of our dear friend\r\nin the world whose messages he has been bringing to us so\r\nlong.  But I like to think he will be sent on some errands\r\nlike that of the presence which came to Ben Adhem with a great\r\nwakening light, rich and like a lily in bloom, to tell him\r\nthat the name of him who loved his fellow men led all the\r\nnames of those the love of God had blessed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\nTHE FOREST OF DEAN\r\nBY JOHN BELLOWS\r\n\r\nThe Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire, is one of the very\r\nfew primeval Forests of Britain that have survived to this\r\ncentury.  It has just been my privilege to accompany Senator\r\nHoar on a drive through a portion of it, and he has asked\r\nme to write a few notes on this visit, for the American Antiquarian\r\nSociety, in the hope that others of its members may share\r\nin the interest he has taken in its archaeology.\r\n\r\nI am indebted for many years' acquaintance with George F.\r\nHoar, through Oliver Wendell Holmes, to the circumstance\r\nthat the Hoar family lived in Gloucester from the time of\r\nthe Tudors, if not earlier; and this has led him to pay repeated\r\nvisits to our old city, with the object of tracing the history\r\nof his forefathers.  In doing this he has been very successful;\r\nand only within the last few months my friend H. Y. J. Taylor,\r\nwho is an untiring searcher of our old records, has come upon\r\nan item in the expenses of the Mayor and Burgesses, of a payment\r\nto Charles Hoar, in the year 1588, for keeping a horse ready\r\nto carry to Cirencester the tidings of the arrival of the\r\nSpanish Armada.  And Charles Hoar's house is with us to this\r\nday, quaintly gabled, and with over-hanging timber-framed\r\nstories, such as the Romans built here in the first century.\r\nIt stands in Longsmith Street, just above the spot where forty\r\nyears ago I looked down on a beautiful tessellated pavement\r\nof, perhaps, the time of Valentinian.  It was eight feet below\r\nthe present surface; for Gloucester, like Rome, has been\r\na rising city.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar had been making his headquarters at Malvern,\r\nand he drove over from there one afternoon, with a view to\r\nour going on in the same carriage to the Forest.  A better\r\nplan would have been to run by rail to Newnham or Lydney,\r\nto be met by a carriage from the \"Speech House,\" a government\r\nhotel in the centre of the woods; but as the arrangement had\r\nbeen made we let it stand.\r\n\r\nTo give a general idea of the positions of the places we\r\nare dealing with, I may say that Upton Knoll, where I am\r\nwriting, stands on the steep edge of a spur of the Cotteswold\r\nHills, three and a half miles south of Gloucester.  Looking\r\nnorth, we have before us the great vale, or rather plain,\r\nof the Severn, bounded on the right by the main chain of the\r\nCotteswolds, rising to just over one thousand feet; and on\r\nthe left by the hills of Herefordshire, and the beautiful\r\nblue peaks of the Malverns; these last being by far the most\r\nstriking feature in the landscape, rising as they do in a\r\nsharp serrated line abruptly from the plain below.  They are\r\nabout ten miles in length, and the highest point, the Worcestershire\r\nBeacon, is some fourteen hundred feet above the sea.  It is\r\nthe spot alluded to in Macaulay's lines on the Armada--\r\n\r\n  Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern's lonely\r\n  height;\r\n\r\nand two hundred years before the Armada it was on \"Malvern\r\nhulles\" that William Langland \"forwandered\" till he fell asleep\r\nand dreamed his fiery \"Vision of Piers Plowman\"--\r\n\r\n  In a somere season, when softe was the sonne\r\n\r\nwhen, looking \"esteward, after the sonne\" he beheld a castle\r\non Bredon Hill\r\n\r\n  Truth was ther-ynne\r\n\r\nand this great plain, that to him symbolized the world.\r\n\r\n  A fair feld ful of folke fonde ich ther bytwyne;\r\n  Alle manere of men; the meme and the ryche.\r\n\r\nNow, in the afternoon light, we can see the towns of Great\r\nand North Malvern, and Malvern Wells, nestling at foot of\r\nthe steep slant; and eight miles to the right, but over thirty\r\nfrom where we stand, the cathedral tower of Worcester.  The\r\nwhole plain is one sea of woods with towers and steeples glinting\r\nfrom every part of it; notably Tewkesbury Abbey, which shines\r\nwhite in the sunlight some fourteen miles from us.  Nearer,\r\nand to the right, Cheltenham stretches out under Cleeve Hill,\r\nthe highest of the Cotteswolds; and to the left Gloucester,\r\nwith its Cathedral dwarfing all the buildings round it.  This\r\nwooded plain before us dies away in the north into two of\r\nthe great Forests of ancient Britain; Wyre, on the left, from\r\nwhich Worcester takes its name; and Feckenham, on the right,\r\nwith Droitwich as its present centre.  Everywhere through\r\nthis area we come upon beautiful old timber-framed houses\r\nof the Tudor time or earlier; Roman of origin, and still met\r\nwith in towns the Romans garrisoned, such as Chester and Gloucester,\r\nthough they have modernized their roofs, and changed their\r\ndiamond window panes for squares, as in the old house of Charles\r\nHoar's, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nNow if we turn from the north view to the west, we get a different\r\nlandscape.  Right before us, a mile off, is Robin's Wood Hill,\r\na Cotteswold outlier; in Saxon times called \"Mattisdun\" or\r\n\"Meadow-hill,\" for it is grassed to the top, among its trees.\r\n\"Matson\" House, there at its foot, was the abode of Charles\r\nI. during his siege of Gloucester in 1643.  To the left of\r\nthis hill we have again the Vale of the Severn, and beyond\r\nit, a dozen miles away, and stretching for twenty miles to\r\nthe southwest are the hills of the Forest of Dean.  They are\r\nsteep, but not lofty--eight hundred or nine hundred feet.\r\nAt their foot yonder, fourteen miles off, is the lake-like\r\nexpanse of the Severn; and where it narrows to something under\r\na mile is the Severn Bridge that carries the line into the\r\nForest from the Midland Railway.  Berkeley Castle lies just\r\non the left of it, but is buried in the trees.  Thornbury\r\nTower, if not Thornbury Castle, further south, is visible\r\nwhen the sun strikes on it.  Close to the right of the bridge\r\nis an old house that belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh; and,\r\ncuriously enough, another on the river bank not far above\r\nit is said to have been occupied by Sir Francis Drake just\r\nbefore the coming of the Armada.  The Duke of Medina Sidonia,\r\nwho commanded the Spanish fleet, was ordered to detach a force\r\nas soon as he landed, to destroy the Forest of Dean, which\r\nwas a principal source for timber for the British navy; and\r\nit is probable that the Queen's ministers were aware of this\r\nand took measures in defence, with which Drake had to do.\r\n\r\nTwo miles lower than the bridge is the Forest port of Lydney,\r\nnow chiefly used for shipping coal; and as the ex-Verderer\r\nof the Forest resides near it, and he would be able to furnish\r\ninformation of interest to our American visitor, we decided\r\nto drive to Lydney to begin.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to start the same day, however; and Senator\r\nHoar stayed at Upton, where his visit happens to mark the\r\nclose of what is known as the \"open-field\" system of tillage;\r\na sort of midway between the full possession of land by freehold,\r\nand  unrestricted common rights.  The area over which he walked,\r\nand which for thousands of years has been divided by \"meres\"\r\nand boundary stones, is now to be enclosed, and so will lose\r\nits archaeological claims to interest.  In one corner of it,\r\nhowever, there still remains a fragment of Roman road, with\r\nsome of the paving stones showing through the grass of the\r\npasture field.  The name of this piece of land gives the clue\r\nto its history.  It is called Sandford; a corruption of Sarn\r\nFord, from _sarnu_ (pronounced \"sarney\") _to pave;_ and _fford,_\r\na road.  These are Celtic Cornish and Welsh words; and it\r\nshould be noted that the names of the Roman roads in the Island\r\nas well as those of the mountains and rivers, are nearly all\r\nCeltic, and not Latin or Saxon.*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* The Whitcombe Roman Villa, four miles east of Upton, stands in\r\na field called Sandals.  In Lyson's description of it, written\r\nin 1819 it stands as _Sarn_dells.  The paved road ran through\r\nthe dell.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nWe made a short delay in the morning, at Gloucester, to give\r\nSenator Hoar time to go on board the boat \"Great Western\"\r\nwhich had just arrived in our docks from Gloucester, Massachusetts,\r\nto visit the mother city, after a perilous voyage across the\r\nAtlantic by Captain Blackburn single-handed.  Senator Hoar\r\nhaving welcomed the captain in his capacity of an old Englishman\r\nand a New Englander \"rolled into one,\" we set out for Lydney,\r\nskirting the bank of one arm of the Severn which here forms\r\nan island.  It was on this Isle of Alney that Canute and Edmund\r\nIronside fought the single-handed battle that resulted in\r\ntheir dividing England between them.*  We pass on to the Island\r\nat Westgate Bridge; and a quarter of a mile further leave\r\nit by Over Bridge; one of Telford's beautiful works.  Just\r\nbelow it the Great Western Railway crosses the river by an\r\niron bridge, the western piers of which rest upon Roman foundations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* Sharon Turner's \"Anglo Saxons,\" Vol. III., Chap. XV.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nOne remarkable thing which I believe I forgot to mention to\r\nGeorge Hoar as we crossed the Island, is, that the meadows\r\non both sides of the causeway belong to the \"Freemen\" of the\r\ncity; and that, go back as far as we may in history, we cannot\r\nfind any account of the original foundation of this body.\r\nBut we have this clue to it--that Gloucester was made into\r\na Colony in the reign of Nerva, just before the end of the\r\nfirst century; and in each Roman colony lands were allotted\r\nto the soldiers of the legions who had become freemen by reason\r\nof having served for twenty-five years.  These lands were\r\nalways on the side of the city nearest the enemy; and the\r\nlands we are crossing are on the western side of Glevum, nearest\r\nthe _Silures,_ or South Welsh, who were always the most dangerous\r\nenemies the Romans had in Britain.  Similarly, at Chester,\r\nthe freemen's lands are on the west, or enemy's side, by the\r\nDee.  In Bath it was the same.\r\n\r\nImmediately after passing \"Over\" Bridge we might turn off,\r\nit time permitted, to see Lassington Oak, a tree of giant\r\nsize and unknown age; but as Emerson says--\r\n\r\n  There's not enough for this and that--\r\n  Make thy option which of two!\r\n\r\nand we make ours for Lydney.  A dozen miles drive, often\r\nskirting the right bank of the Severn, brings us to Newnham,\r\na picturesque village opposite a vast bend, or horse-shoe,\r\nof the river, and over which we get a beautiful view from\r\nthe burial ground on the cliff.  The water expands like a\r\nlake, beyond which the woods, house-interspersed, stretch\r\naway to the blue Cotteswold Hills; the monument to William\r\nTyndale being a landmark on one of them--Nibley Knoll.  Just\r\nunder that monument was fought the last great battle between\r\nBarons.  This battle of Nibley Knoll, between Lord Berkeley\r\nand Lord Lisle, left the latter dead on the field, at night,\r\nwith a thousand of the men of the two armies; and made Lord\r\nBerkeley undisputed master of the estates whose name he bore.\r\n\r\nWe now leave the river, and turn inland; and in a short time\r\nwe have entered the Forest of Dean proper; that is, the lands\r\nthat belong to the Crown.  Their area may be roughly set down\r\nas fifteen miles by ten; but in the time of the Conqueror,\r\nand for many years after, it was much larger; extending from\r\nRoss on the north, to Gloucester on the east, and thence thirty\r\nmiles to Chepstow on the south-west.  That is, it filled the\r\ntriangle formed by the Severn and the Wye between these towns.\r\nIt is doubtless due to this circumstance of its being so completely\r\ncut off from the rest of the country by these rivers that\r\nit has preserved more remarkably than any other Forest, the\r\ncharacteristics and customs of ancient British life, to which\r\nwe shall presently refer; for their isolation has kept the\r\nDean Foresters to this hour a race apart.\r\n\r\nSir James Campbell, who was for between thirty and forty years\r\nthe chief \"Verderer,\" or principal government officer of the\r\nForest, lives near Lydney.  He received us with great kindness,\r\nand gave us statistics of the rate of grown of the oak, both\r\nwith and without transplantation.  Part of them are published\r\nin an official report on the Forest (A 12808.  6/1884.  Wt.\r\n3276. Eyre & Spottiswoode, London) and part are in manuscript\r\nwith which Senator Hoar has been presented.  Briefly, the\r\nchief points are these:\r\n\r\nIn 1784 or thereabouts acorns were planted in \"Acorn Patch\r\nEnclosure\" in the Forest; and in 1800 trees marked A and B\r\nwere taken from this place and planted opposite the \"Speech\r\nHouse.\"  Two, marked D and F, were drawn out of Acorn Patch\r\nin 1807 and planted near the Speech House fence.  Another,\r\nmarked N, was planted in 1807, five and one-half feet high,\r\nin the Speech House grounds, next the road; and L, M, N, X,\r\nhave remained untransplanted in the Acorn Patch.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions were (circumference, six feet from the ground),\r\nin inches--\r\n                    A       B      D      F      L      M      N      X\r\nIn 1814, Oct.  5,  14-3/4  14     11      9-1/2 15-5/8 18-1/2 13     24-1/2\r\n   1824, Oct. 20,  29-1/2  28-3/4 25-3/8 22-1/8 22-1/2 23-3/4 30-1/8 32-1/8\r\n   1844, Oct.  5,  58-1/2  58     45     46     35     34-1/2 57     44-1/2\r\n   1864, Oct.  1,  73-1/2  71     59-1/2 67-3/4 46-1/2 44     73-1/4 56\r\n\r\nAnother experiment tried by Sir James Campbell himself gave\r\nthe following results:\r\n\r\nExperiment begun in 1861 to test the value, if any, of merely\r\nlifting and replanting oak trees in the same holes without\r\nchange of soil, situation, or giving increased space; as compared\r\nwith the experiment already detailed, which was begun in\r\n1800.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, twelve oak trees of about 25 years' growth, which\r\nhad been self-sown (dropping from old trees afterwards cut\r\ndown) in a thick plantation, were selected, all within gunshot\r\nof each other, and circumferences measured at five feet from\r\nthe ground.  Of these, six were taken up and immediately replanted\r\nin the same holes.  The other six were not interfered with\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nAggregate admeasurement of six   Aggregate admeasurement of six\r\ndug up and replanted.  Marked    not interfered with.

In the next season 80 per cent. of them\r\nsend up shoots from two to three feet high, and at once start\r\noff on their life's mission.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nFrom Lydney a drive of a few miles through pleasant ups and\r\ndowns of woodland and field, brings us to Whitemead Park,\r\nthe official residence of the Verderer, Philip Baylis.  The\r\ntitle \"Verderer\" is Norman, indicating the administration\r\nof all that relates to the \"Vert\" or \"Greenery\" of the Forest;\r\nthat is, of the timber, the enclosures, the roads, and the\r\nsurface generally.  The Verderer's Court is held at the \"Speech\r\nHouse,\" to which we shall presently come: but the Forest of\r\nDean is also a mineral district, and the Miners have a separate\r\nCourt of their own.  That some of their customs go back to\r\na very remote antiquity we may well believe when we find the\r\nscale of which the Romans worked iron in the Forest; a scale\r\nso great that with their imperfect method of smelting with\r\nCatalan furnaces, etc., so much metal was left in the Roman\r\ncinder that it has been sought after all the way down to within\r\nthe present generation as a source of profit; and in the\r\ntime of Edward I., one-fourth of the king's revenue from\r\nthis Forest was derived from the remelted Roman refuse.\r\n\r\nI have a beautiful Denarius of Hadrian which was found in\r\nthe old Roman portion of the Lydney-Park Iron Mine in 1854,\r\nwith a number of other silver coins, some of them earlier\r\nin date; but when we speak of the \"mines,\" the very ancient\r\nones in the Forest were rather deep quarries than what would\r\nnow be termed mines.  As we drive along we now and then notice\r\nnear the roadside, nearly hidden by the dense foliage of the\r\nbushes, long dark hollows, which are locally known as _\"scowles,\"_\r\nanother Celtic word meaning gorges or hollows; something like\r\nghyll in the Lake District, \"Dungeon Ghyll,\" and so on.  These\r\nwere Roman and British Hematite mines.  If we had been schoolboys\r\nI would have taken Senator Hoar down into a scowl and we should\r\nboth have come back with our clothes spoiled, and our arms\r\nfull of the splendid hartstongue ferns that cover the sides\r\nand edges of the ravine.  But they are dangerous places for\r\nany but miners _or_ schoolboys; and I shrank from encouraging\r\nan enthusiastic American to risk being killed in a Roman pit,\r\neven with the ideal advantage of afterwards being buried with\r\nhis own ancestors in England!  So I said but little about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Miners' Court is presided over by another government\r\nofficer, called the \"Gaveller\"; from a Celtic word which means\r\n_holding;_ as in the Kentish custom of \"Gavelkind.\"* These\r\ncourts are held in \"Saint Briavels\" (pronounced \"Brevels\")\r\nCastle:  a quaint old building of the thirteenth century,\r\non the western edge of the Forest, where it was placed to\r\nkeep the Welsh in check.  It looks down on a beautiful reach\r\nof the river Wye at Bigswear; and it was just on this edge\r\nthat Wordsworth stood in 1798, when he thought out his \"Lines\r\ncomposed a few miles above Tintern Abbey,\" etc.\r\n\r\n  Five years have passed; five summers, with the length\r\n  Of five long winters; and again I hear\r\n  These waters rolling from their mountain springs\r\n  With a soft inland murmur.  Once again\r\n  Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar will recall the scene from the railway below:\r\nthe\r\n\r\n  \"Plots of cottage ground\" that \"lose themselves\r\n  'Mid groves and copses\";\r\n\r\nand he will say how exactly the words describe\r\n\r\n  These hedge-rows; hardly hedge-rows; little lines\r\n  Of sportive wood run wild,\r\n\r\nfor they cover yards in width in some places, as he will\r\nremember my pointing out to him.  The castle is placed on\r\nthe outside of the Forest and close on the Wye, to guard what\r\nwas seven centuries ago the frontier of Wales; and the late\r\nWilliam Philip Price (Commissioner of Railways and for many\r\nyears member of Parliament for Gloucester) told me that when\r\nhe was a boy the Welsh tongue was still spoken at Landogo,\r\nthe next village down the river, midway between Bigswear and\r\nTintern.\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* I suspect \"Gaffer,\" the English equivalent of \"Boss,\" may be\r\nthe same root:  _i. e.,_ the _taker_ or contractor.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nPhilip Baylis showed us some of the old parchments connected\r\nwith the Mine Court; one document especially precious being\r\na copy of the \"Book of Denys,\" made in the time of Edward\r\nIII.  It sets forth the ancient customs which formed the laws\r\nof the miners.  At this point the Verderer had to settle some\r\nmatter of the instant, but he put us under the care of a young\r\nman who acted as our guide to one of the ancient and giant\r\noaks of the Forest, on the \"Church Hill\" enclosure, about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile up the hill above the Park.  Nicholls\r\n(\"History of the Forest of Dean,\" page 20) thinks the name\r\nChurch Hill comes from the setting apart of some land here\r\nfor the Convent of _Grace Dieu_ to pay for masses for the\r\nsouls of Richard II., his ancestors and successors.\r\n\r\nIt was a steep climb; and the evening twilight was coming\r\non apace as we followed the little track to the spot where\r\nthe old oak rises high above the general level of the wood,\r\nreminding one of Rinaldo's magical myrtle, in \"Jerusalem Delivered\":\r\n\r\n  O'er pine, and palm, and cypress it ascends;\r\n  And towering thus all other trees above\r\n  Looks like the elected queen and genius of the grove!\r\n\r\nOnly that for an _oak_ of similar standing we must say \"king\"\r\ninstead of \"queen\"; emblem as it is of iron strength and endurance.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much the girth of the tree as its whole bearing\r\nthat impresses a beholder; and I do not think either of us\r\nwill forget its effect in the gloom and silence and mystery\r\nof the gathering night.\r\n\r\nResisting a kindly pressure to stay the night at Whitemead,\r\nthat we might keep to our programme of sleeping at the Speech\r\nHouse, we started on the last portion of the long day's drive.\r\nThe road from Parkend, after we have climbed a considerable\r\nhill, keeps mostly to the level of a high ridge.  It is broad\r\nand smooth; and the moonlight and its accompanying black shadows\r\non the trees made the journey one of great beauty; while the\r\nmountain air lessened the sense of fatigue that would otherwise\r\nhave pressed heavily on us after so long a day amid such novel\r\nsurroundings.  The only thing to disturb the solitude is\r\nthe clank of machinery; and the lurid lights, as we pass a\r\ncolliery; and then a mile of two more with but the sound\r\nof our own wheels and the rhythm of the horses' feet, and\r\nwe suddenly draw up at an hotel in the midst of the Forest,\r\nits quiet well-lighted interior inviting us through the doorway,\r\nleft open to the cool summer night air.  We are at the Speech\r\nHouse.  We had bespoken our rooms by wire in the morning:\r\nSenator Hoar had a _chambre d'honneur,_ with a gigantic carved\r\nfour-post bed that reminded him of the great bed of Ware.\r\nHis room like my \"No. 5,\" looked out over magnificent bays\r\nof woodland to the north.  The Speech House is six hundred\r\nfeet above the sea, and the mountain breeze coming through\r\nthe wide open window, with this wonderful prospect of oak\r\nand beech and holly in the moonlight,--the distance veiled,\r\nbut scarcely veiled, by the mist, suggest a poem untranslatable\r\nin words, and incommunicable except to those who have passed\r\nunder the same spell.  We speak of a light that makes darkness\r\nvisible; and similarly there are sounds that deepen the long\r\nintervals of silence with which they alternate.  One or two\r\nvehicles driving past; now and then the far-off call of owls\r\nanswering one another in the woods--one of the sweetest sounds\r\nin nature--the varying cadence carrying with it a sense of\r\nboundlessness and infinite distance; and with it we fall asleep.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything more beautiful than a moonlight summer\r\nnight in the heart of the Forest of Dean, it is its transformation\r\ninto a summer morning, with the sparkle of dew on the grass,\r\nand the sunrise on the trees; with the music of birds, and\r\nthe freshness that gives all these their charm.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we are dressed we take a stroll out among the trees.\r\nIn whichever direction we turn we are struck by the abundance\r\nof hollies.  I believe there are some three thousand full\r\ngrown specimens within a radius of a mile of the Speech House.\r\nThis may be due to the spot having been from time immemorial\r\nthe central and most important place in the Forest.  The roads\r\nthat lead to it still show the Roman paving-stones in many\r\nplaces, as Senator Hoar can bear witness; and the central\r\npoint of a British Forest before the Roman time would be occupied\r\nby a sacred oak.  The Forest into which Julius Caesar pursued\r\nthe Britons to their stronghold, was Anderida, that is, the\r\nHoly Oak; from _dar,_ oak (Sanskrit, daru, a tree), and _da,_\r\ngood.  It is worth remarking that this idea survives in the\r\npersonal name, Holyoak; for who ever heard of \"Holyelm,\" or\r\n\"Holyash,\" or a similar form compounded of the adjective and\r\nthe name of any other tree than the oak.  If there is an exception\r\nit is in the name of the _holly_.  The Cornish Celtic word\r\nfor holly was Celyn, from Celli (or Kelli), a grove; literally\r\na _grove-one;_ so that the holly was probably planted as a\r\ngrove or screen round the sacred oak.  Such a planting of\r\na holly grove in the central spot of the Forest in the Druid\r\ntime, would account for these trees being now so much more\r\nnumerous round the Speech House than they are in any other\r\npart of the woods.  The Saxon name is merely the word _holy_\r\nwith the vowel shortened, as in _holi_day; and that the tree\r\nreally was regarded as holy is shown by the custom in the\r\nForest Mine Court of taking the oath on a stick of holly held\r\nin the hand.  This custom survived down to our own times;\r\nfor Kedgwin H. Fryer, the late Town Clerk of Gloucester,\r\ntold me he had often seen a miner sworn in the Court, touching\r\nthe Bible with the holly stick!  The men always kept their\r\ncaps on when giving evidence to show they were \"Free miners.\"\r\n\r\nThe oaks, marked A. B., of whose growth statistics have already\r\nbeen given, stand on the side of the Newnham road opposite\r\nthe Speech House.  The Verderer is carrying on the annual\r\nrecord of their measurements.\r\n\r\nWe return to the house by the door on the west; the one at\r\nwhich we arrived last evening.  It was then too dark to observe\r\nthat the stone above it, of which I took a careful sketch\r\nseveral years ago, is crumbling from the effects of weather,\r\nafter having withstood them perfectly for two centuries.  The\r\ncrown on it is scarcely recognizable; and the lettering has\r\nall disappeared except part of the R.\r\n\r\nWe breakfast in the quaint old Court room.  Before us is\r\nthe railed-off dais, at the end, where the Verderer and his\r\nassistants sit to administer the law.  On the wall behind\r\nthem are the antlers of a dozen stags; reminders of the time,\r\nabout the middle of the present century, when the herds of\r\ndeer were destroyed on account of the continual poaching to\r\nwhich they gave occasion.  Many of the cases that come before\r\nthe Court now are of simple trespass.\r\n\r\nThis quaint old room, with its great oak beam overhead, and\r\nits kitchen grate wide enough to roast a deer--this strange\r\nblending of an hotel dining-room and a Court of Justice, has\r\nnevertheless a link with the far distant past more wonderful\r\nthan anything that has come down to us in the ruins of Greece\r\nor Rome.\r\n\r\nLook at the simple card that notifies the dates of holding\r\nthe Vederer's Court.  Here is an old one which the Verderer,\r\nPhilip Baylis, has kindly sent to Senator Hoar in response\r\nto his request for a copy.\r\n\r\n  V. R.\r\n  Her Majesty's Forest of Dean,\r\n  Gloucestershire,\r\n  VERDERERS' COURT.\r\n  Verderers:\r\n  Charles Bathurst, Esq.  Sir Thomas H.\r\n  Crawley-Boevey, Bart.\r\n  Maynard Willoughby Colchester-Wemyss, Esq.\r\n  Russell James Kerr, Esq.\r\n  Deputy-Surveyor:\r\n  Philip Baylis, Esq.\r\n  Steward:\r\n  James Wintle.\r\n  ----NOTICE----\r\n  The VERDERERS of Her Majesty's Forest of Dean hereby give\r\n  Notice that the COURT of ATTACHMENT of our Sovereign Lady\r\n  the Queen for the said Forest will be holden by adjournment, at\r\n  the Speech House, in the said Forest, at half-past Two o'clock, in\r\n  the afternoon, on the following days during the year 1897, viz.:\r\n  Wednesday, the 27th January;\r\n  Monday, the 8th March;\r\n  Saturday, the 17th April;\r\n  Thursday, the 27th May;\r\n  Tuesday, the 6th July;\r\n  Monday, the 16th August;\r\n  Friday, the 24th September;\r\n  Wednesday, the 3rd November;\r\n  Monday, the 13th December;\r\n  James Wintle,\r\n  Steward.\r\n  Newnham, 1st January, 1897.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I stood in the Court Room examining a similar\r\nnotice, puzzled at the absence of any system or order in the\r\ntimes appointed for the sittings, which did not come once\r\na month, or every six weeks; and did not even fall twice in\r\nsuccession on the same day of the week.  Turning to the landlord\r\nof the hotel I asked, \"What is the rule for holding the Court?\r\n_When_ is it held?\"  _\"Every forty days at twelve o'clock\r\nat noon\"_ was the reply.  Reflection showed that so strange\r\na periodicity related to no notation of time with which we\r\nare now in touch; it must belong to a system that has passed\r\naway; but what could this be?\r\n\r\nWe are reminded by the date of the building we are in (1680),\r\nthat the room itself cannot have been used for much more than\r\ntwo centuries for holding the Courts.\r\n\r\nBut there was a Verderer's Court held in several Forests\r\nbesides this Forest of Dean, long before the Stuart days.\r\nThe office itself is mentioned in Canute's Forest charter,\r\ndating back nearly nine hundred years; and as at that period\r\nabout a third of England was covered with Forests, their influence\r\nmust have been very powerful; and local laws and customs in\r\nthem must have been far too firmly established for such a\r\nman as Canute to alter them.  He could only have confirmed\r\nwhat he found; much as he confirmed the laws of nature as\r\nthey affected the tides at Southampton!\r\n\r\nThe next Forest Charter of national importance after Canute's,\r\nis that of Henry III., in 1225.  It is clear that he, again,\r\nmade no material change in the old order of things; and in\r\nrecapitulating the old order of the Forest Courts, he ordains\r\nthat the Court of Attachment (called in Dean Forest the Court\r\nof the Speech) was to be held _every forty days._ This Court\r\nwas one of first instance, simply for the hearing of evidence\r\nand getting up the cases for the \"Swainmote,\"* which came\r\n_three times a year._ The Swains were free man; and at their\r\n_mote_ evidence was required from _three_ witnesses in each\r\ncase, on which the Verderer and other officers of the king\r\npassed sentence in accordance with the laws laid down in this\r\nCharter.  From this Swainmote there was a final appeal to\r\nthe High Court of the Judges in Eyre (Eyre, from \"errer\" to\r\nwander, being the Norman French for Itinerant, or, on Circuit)\r\nwhich was held _once in three years._\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* That the Forest Charter of Hen. III. did not establish these\r\ncourts is proved from a passage in Manwood, cap. 8, which runs\r\nthus:  \"And the said Swainmotes shal not be kept but within the\r\ncounties in the which they have been used to be kept.\"\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nThe forty-day court was common to all the ancient forests\r\nof Britain; and that they go back to _before_ the time of\r\nHenry III. is clear from the following extracts from Coke's\r\nFourth Institute, for which I am indebted to the kindness\r\nof James G. Wood, of Lincoln's Inn.\r\n\r\nCAP.

We are, therefore,\r\ndriven back to the period before the Roman invasion in Britain,\r\nand when the Forest legislation was, as Caesar found it, in\r\nthe hands of the Druids.  In his brief and vivid account of\r\nthese people he tells us that they used the Greek alphabet;\r\nand as he also says they were very proficient in astronomy,\r\nit seems clear that they had their astronomy from the same\r\nsource as their literature.  Their astronomy involved of necessity\r\ntheir notation of time.  And the Greeks, in turn, owed their\r\nastronomy to the Egyptians, with whom the year was reckoned\r\nas of three hundred and sixty days; and this three hundred\r\nand sixty-day year gives us the clue to the forty-day period\r\nfor holding the Forest Courts in Ancient Britain.\r\n\r\nWe cannot fail to be struck, as we examine the old Forest\r\ncustoms, with the constant use of the _number three,_ as a\r\nsacred or \"lucky\" number, on every possible occasion.  We\r\nhave just seen the role it plays in the Mine Court, with its\r\n_three_ presiding officials, its jury of multiples of _three_\r\n(twelve, twenty-four, forty-eight); its holly stick oath sworn\r\nby _three_ witnesses.  We have notice the Swainmote Court,\r\nalso requiring _three_ witnesses, held _three_ times a year, and\r\nsubordinate to the Court of Eyre held once in _three_ years;\r\nto which should be added the perambulation of the Forest\r\nbounds at the same triennial visit in Eyre, when the king's\r\nofficers were accompanied by nine foresters in fee (_three\r\nthrees_) and twenty-four jurors (_eight threes_).\r\n\r\nTo go fully into the role of the number three in British\r\ntraditions would require a profound study; but it may be\r\nuseful briefly to note its influence on the Bardic poetry--\r\nthe Triads, where the subjects are all grouped in threes.\r\nNor was this predilection confined to the Island.  We find\r\nit affecting the earliest history of Rome itself, with its _nine_\r\ngods (\"By the nine gods he swore\") and the _nine_ books which\r\nthe Sibyl destroyed by _threes,_ till the last _three_ were\r\nsaved.  Then we have the evidence in the name _nundina_*\r\nfor a market, that the week was originally a cycle not of\r\nseven, but of _nine_ days; and our own saying that a given\r\nthing is a _\"nine days wonder\"_ is undoubtedly a survival\r\nfrom the period when the nine days made a week,** for such\r\na phrase expresses a round number or unit of time; not nine\r\n_separate_ days.\r\n\r\n[Footnotes]\r\n* The Romans meant by _nundinae_ periods that were really of\r\neight days; but they made them nine by counting in the one _from_\r\nwhich they started.  So accustomed were they to this method\r\nof notation that the priests who had the control of the calendar,\r\nupset Julius Caesar's plan for intercalating a day once in\r\n_four_ years (\"Bissextile\") by insisting that the interval\r\nintended was _three_ years!  Augustus was obliged to rectify\r\nthis by dropping the overplus day it occasioned.  It is this\r\nRoman custom of _inclusive_ reckoning which has led to the\r\nFrench calling a week _huit jours_, and a fortnight, _une\r\nquinzaine_.\r\n\r\n** The word week comes from _wika_ (= Norsk _vika_) to bend or\r\n_turn_.  The idea connected with it was no doubt that of the\r\nmoon's turning from one of its quarters to the next.  I can\r\nremember when some of the people in \"the Island\" in Gloucester\r\nalways made a point of _turning_ any coins they had in their\r\npockets when it was new moon and repeating a sort of invocation\r\nto the moon!  How or when the nine day week was exchanged\r\nby western nations for the seven day one, we do not know;\r\nbut it is likely that it may have been brought about by the\r\nPhoenicians and Jews, who regarded the number _seven_ as\r\nthe Druids regarded _three_--as something especially sacred.\r\nThey had much of the commerce of Southern Europe in their\r\nhands, and, therefore, a certain power in controlling the\r\nmarkets, which it would be a convenience to Jews to _prevent_\r\nfalling on the sabbath day.  The circumstance that the lunar\r\nmonth fitted in with four weeks of seven days no doubt made it\r\neasier to effect the change from _nundinae_.\r\n[End of Footnotes]\r\n\r\nShakespeare had been struck with the relationship of the\r\n_nine_ day week, alluded to in the proverb, to the more modern\r\none of seven days, as is shown by his very clever juxtaposition\r\nof the two in \"As You Like It.\"  In Act III., Scene 2, he\r\nmakes Celia say to Rosalind\r\n\r\n\"But didst thou hear _without wondering_ how thy name should\r\nbe hanged and carved upon these trees?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Rosalind replies\r\n\r\n\"I was _seven_ of the _nine days out of the wonder_ before\r\nyou came\"--_etc._\r\n\r\nGloucester, down till the Norman time, and after, was the\r\ngreat manufactory of the iron brought from the Forest of\r\nDean.  The metal was brought up the Severn by barges, to\r\nthe quay which stood at the road running straight down from\r\nLongsmith Street (in which Charles Hoar's house stands), and\r\nburied under all this street we find the cinder and slag of\r\nthe Roman forges.  In Domesday book (which was ordered to\r\nbe drawn up at a Parliament in Gloucester in 1083) it states\r\nthat the City had paid to the King (_i. e.,_ Edward the Confessor)\r\nten _dicres_ of iron yearly.  This is very remarkable, for\r\na dicre was three dozen rods or bars; so that the whole tribute\r\nwas three hundred and sixty bars, or _one bar per day for\r\nthe Druid year of three hundred and sixty days._*\r\n\r\n[Footnote]\r\n* For more than a century after Julius Caesar had altered the\r\nyear to three hundred and sixty-five days, the Roman soldiers\r\nwere still paid at the ancient rate of three hundred and\r\nsixty days only, losing the rest as _\"terminalia,\"_ or days\r\nnot counted as belonging to the year!  The proof of this\r\nis that in the time of Domitian a soldier's _year's_ pay divided\r\nby three hundred and sixty gives an even number of _ases_.\r\n[End of Footnote]\r\n\r\nAnd now we come back to the Verderer's Court at the Speech\r\nHouse with a clear reason for its being held _\"every forty\r\ndays at twelve o'clock at noon.\"_\r\n\r\nForty days was the _ninth_ of the Druid year of three hundred\r\nand sixty, and was a period of five weeks of eight days each,\r\nbut which according to the ancient method of counting were\r\ncalled _\"nine-days.\"_  And the reason the Court sits \"at Twelve\r\no'clock at noon\" is because the Druid day began at noon.  Even\r\nnow, within ten miles of where I write, the children on Minchinhampton\r\nCommon, on the Cotteswold hills, keep up _\"old May Day,\"_\r\nwhich was the opening of the Druid year, though they are ignorant\r\nof this.  Boys and girls arm themselves on that day with boughs\r\nof the beech, and go through certain games with them; but\r\nexactly as the clock strikes _twelve_ they throw them away,\r\nunder pain of being stigmatized as _\"May fools!\"_\r\n\r\nWell has Oliver Wendell Holmes put it, that _\"All_ things\r\nare _in all_ things!\"  Even this commonplace list of Court\r\ndays in the Forest of Dean becomes a beautiful poem when\r\nthe light of such a past shines on it; just as the veriest dust\r\nof the Krakatoan volcano evolves itself into every color\r\nof the rainbow when it rises into the sunset sky.\r\n\r\nSince writing this paper I find that Philip Baylis, the Verderer\r\nof the Forest of Dean, has kindly sent three or four dozen\r\nof young oak trees from the Government plantations, to Washington,\r\nin order that they may be planted there and in some other\r\nplaces in the United States, to begin the century with.  The\r\nState Department of Agriculture has arranged for the planting\r\nof these oaks, and the periodical record of their measurements,\r\nso that a valuable basis will be established for an experiment\r\nthat may be carried on for a century, or more; and we, the\r\narchaeologists of the nineteenth century, shall have wiped\r\naway the stigma implied in the old Aberdeen Baillie's remark,\r\nthat as _Posteerity_ had never done anything for us, we ought\r\nnot to do anything for _posteerity!_\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Ducie has sent, accompanying these Forest of Dean\r\noaks, four small plants, seedlings from the great Chestnut\r\nTree on his Estate at Tortworth; the largest and oldest of\r\nits sort in Great Britain.  It measures forty-nine feet round\r\nthe trunk.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Speech House for Coleford and Newland we descend\r\na steep hill for half a mile, and crossing the rail at the\r\nStation we begin to ascend the opposite rise through the woods.\r\nAs the carriage climbs slowly up we keep on the lookout for\r\nthe margin-stones of the Roman paving which here and there\r\nshow through the modern metaled surface--pieces fifteen to\r\ntwenty inches long by about five inches in thickness, and\r\nset so deep in the ground that eighteen hundred years' wear\r\nhas never moved them.  They are buttressed on the outer edge\r\nby similar blocks set four or five inches lower, and themselves\r\nforming one side of the solidly paved water-way or gutter\r\nwhich was constructed as part of every such road on a steep\r\ngradient, to secure it from abrasion by flood or sudden rush\r\nfrom heavy rainfall.  There are many excellent examples of\r\nthis in the Forest of Dean.  We are on the watch, however,\r\nfor some part where the _\"margines\"_ remain on _both_ sides\r\nof the way.  At last we come upon such a place, and alighting\r\nfrom the carriage we strain the tape measure across at two\r\nor three points.  The mean we find to be thirteen feet and\r\nseven inches.  As the Roman foot was just over three per cent.\r\nless than ours, this means that the Romans built the road\r\nhere for a fourteen-foot way.  So far as I have examined\r\ntheir roads they were always constructed to certain standard\r\nwidths--seven feet, nine feet, eleven feet, thirteen feet,\r\nfourteen feet, or fifteen feet.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that most of the main roads in\r\nEngland are Roman; but the very continuity of their use has\r\ncaused this to be overlooked.  All the _old_ roads in the\r\nForest of Dean have been pronounced by the Ordnance Surveyors,\r\nafter close examination, to bear evidences of Roman paving,\r\nalthough for some centuries since then wheel carriages went\r\nout of use here!\r\n\r\nThere is a vivid description in Statius of the making of\r\nan imperial-road through such another Forest (if not indeed\r\nthis very one!) especially worth recalling here, because it\r\nwas written at very nearly the period of the building of\r\nthis track over which we are journeying; _i. e.,_ near the\r\nend of the first century.\r\n\r\nThe poet stands on a hill from which he can see the effect\r\nof the united work of the army of men who are engaged in\r\nthe construction:  perhaps a hundred thousand forced laborers,\r\nunder the control of the legionary soldiers who act as the\r\nengineers.  He makes us see and hear with him the tens of\r\nthousands of stone cutters and the ring of their tools squaring\r\nthe \"setts\"; and then one platoon after another stepping forward\r\nand laying down its row of stones followed by rank after rank\r\nof men with the paviours' rammers, which rise and fall at\r\nthe sweep of the band-master's rods, keeping time in a stately\r\nmusic as they advance; the continuous falling and crashing\r\nof the trees as other thousands of hands ply the axes along\r\nthe lines, that creep, slowly, but visibly, on through the\r\nForest that no foot had ever trodden--the thud of the multitudinous\r\nmachines driving the piles in the marshy spaces; the whole\r\ninnumerable sounds falling on the ear like the roaring of\r\na great and vast sea.\r\n\r\nThe language Statius uses is more simple than mine; but this\r\nis substantially the picture he gives:  and I know of nothing\r\nthat so impresses on the imagination the thunder of the power\r\nof the Roman Empire as this creation in the wilderness, in\r\none day, of an iron way that shall last for all time.\r\n\r\nWe are here in the sweet silence of a summer morning, eighteen\r\nhundred years after such a scene, and able mentally to catch\r\nsome glimpse of it; some echo of the storm that has left behind\r\nit so ineffaceable a mark.\r\n\r\n\"I intended to ask you just now whether the man you spoke\r\nto in the road was a typical native of the district?\" said\r\nSenator Hoar.  \"He was dark and swarthy, with very black hair\r\nand piercing eyes; not at all like the majority of people\r\nwe see in Gloucester for instance.\"  \"Yes, he is a typical\r\nForester\"; exactly such a man as Tacitus describes his Silurian\r\nancestors; so Spanish in appearance that he tries to account\r\nfor it by remarking that _\"that part of Britain lies over\r\nagainst Spain\";_ as if it was such a short run across the\r\nBay of Biscay to the upper end of the Bristol Channel that\r\nnothing would be more natural than for Spaniards to sail over\r\nhere with their wives and families and become Silures!\r\n\r\nThese Western Britons, both here in the Forest and in Cornwall\r\ncertainly remind one of Spaniards.  The type is of an older\r\nCeltic than that of the present Welsh people proper, as some\r\nevidences in the language also point to the occupation being\r\nan older one.  With respect to this particular district of\r\nthe Forest and the East of Monmouthshire, one more element\r\nmust not be left out of the account; and that is, that Caerleon\r\nwas founded by the second legion being removed to it from\r\nGloucester about the time this road was made; and that it\r\nremained for three hundred years the headquarters of that\r\nlegion, which was a Spanish one raised in the time of Augustus.\r\nForty years ago I remember being at Caerleon (two and one\r\nhalf miles from Newport), when I met the children of the village\r\ncoming out of school.  It was hard to believe they were not\r\nSpanish or Italian!\r\n\r\nAt all events this part of Britain lies over against Boston;\r\nand Americans can cross over and see Caerleon for themselves\r\nmore easily than the people could, of whom Tacitus wrote.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX [omitted]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's notes:\r\n\r\nTyped into MS-DOS Editor under Windows XP, using 7-bit characters\r\nonly.
