THE ROMAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PRE-AUGUSTAN\r\n\r\nRoman political history has an unusual meaning and value for us,\r\nbecause the Romans had to face so many of the problems which confront\r\nus today, and their experience ran through such a wide range. Few\r\npeoples can boast of an unbroken history of a thousand years, and\r\nperhaps none has tried so many different forms of government. The\r\nearly monarchy gives way to an oligarchy, to be displaced in turn by\r\na democracy. The dual government of the prince and the senate which\r\nfollows develops into the empire, and the emperor in time becomes the\r\nautocratic monarch. In this period of a thousand years from the seventh\r\ncentury before our era to the fourth century after it, we may see in\r\nthe practical experiences of the Roman people the points of strength\r\nand of weakness in an aristocracy, a plutocracy, a parliamentary\r\ngovernment, a democratic empire, and an autocracy. We may also trace in\r\nthe history of Rome the development of a city-state into a world-wide\r\nempire. In its early days the territory of Rome covered scarcely a\r\nhundred square miles. Then followed one after another the conquest of\r\nCentral Italy, of the whole peninsula, of the Western Mediterranean, of\r\nthe Greek Orient, and of Western Europe and the region of the Danube,\r\nuntil Roman rule extended from the Sahara to the Rhine, from the\r\nTigris and the Euphrates to the Atlantic. This tremendous territorial\r\nexpansion, which brought within the limits of the State people of\r\ndiverse races, colors, and religions, called for a constant recasting\r\nand readjustment of political forms and methods, and the solution of\r\ncountless new political problems. In almost all of our colonies or\r\ndependencies today, in the Philippines, in Asia, and in Africa we\r\nhave to deal only with peoples less advanced in civilization than we\r\nare, but the Romans had not only to civilize and govern the stubborn\r\ntribes of Gaul and Spain, but also to make their authority respected\r\nin the Greek East, among peoples who could boast of a civilization far\r\nhigher and older than their own. That a city-state with the old and\r\nnarrow local social and political traditions which Rome had could adapt\r\nherself to the government of a world-empire composed of such diverse\r\nelements as made up the Roman Empire is one of the marvels of history,\r\nand a study of the methods which she followed can not fail to throw\r\nlight on political questions which we have to meet today. The range of\r\nsocial and economic conditions through which Rome went is equally wide.\r\nThe Romans come on the stage of history as a primitive pastoral people\r\nwith strongholds on the hills. In course of time they build cities\r\nall over the world whose beauty and magnificence have perhaps never\r\nbeen equalled. Their government had to keep pace with these social and\r\neconomic changes, and consequently had to adapt itself to almost every\r\nconceivable state of society.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these facts one may be inclined to raise the question\r\nwhether our civilization can have much in common with one so far\r\nremoved from it in point of time, and whether the study of such an\r\nancient society will have more than an intellectual or historical\r\ninterest for us. This would be true perhaps if we were studying the\r\npolitical system of almost any other people of antiquity. It is hard\r\nfor us to understand or sympathize with the social or political ideas\r\nof the Egyptians, the Assyrians, or the Persians. Perhaps it is not\r\neasy to find much even in the political experiences of the Greeks\r\nwhich will be of practical service to us. But with the Romans it is\r\ndifferent. If an immigrant from ancient Rome of the first century\r\nbefore our era should disembark in New York tomorrow, he would need\r\nless training in understanding our political machinery than many of\r\nour contemporary immigrants do, because the Anglo-Saxon and the Roman\r\nshow the same characteristics in their political life. Both peoples\r\nare opportunists. Both peoples are inclined to meet a new situation by\r\nmaking as little change as possible in the old machinery. Both have a\r\ngreat deal of practical common sense, and no high regard for formal\r\nlogic or consistency. The Romans had the institution of slavery, and\r\nwe have developed a complex industrial system through the application\r\nof steam and electricity, and steam and electricity have changed the\r\nexternal aspects of our lives. But these differences have not affected\r\ndeeply the political thinking of the two peoples. We have little in\r\ncommon with any other peoples of antiquity. We have still less with\r\nthose of the Middle Ages. The ideals of chivalry, of feudalism, of the\r\nmedieval church, and the submergence of the individual in society,\r\nare altogether foreign to our way of thinking. Perhaps it is the\r\nincomprehensible nature of these fifteen hundred years of medieval\r\ncivilization that separate our times from those of the Romans which has\r\nprevented us from recognizing our political kinship to the Romans. From\r\nthis resemblance between Roman civilization and our own, and between\r\nthe Roman character and our own, it does not necessarily follow that\r\ntheir system of government was closely akin to ours, or that we have\r\ninherited many political institutions directly from them. It would,\r\nhowever, naturally mean that many of their political problems would be\r\nlike ours, and that their method of approaching them would be similar\r\nto ours. In some cases they solved these problems with more or less\r\nsuccess; in others, they failed. The legacy which they have handed down\r\nto us, then, is the practical demonstration in their political life\r\nof the merits of certain forms of government and of certain methods\r\nof dealing with political and social questions, and the weakness of\r\nothers. The points of resemblance between the ancient and the modern,\r\nand the large extent of our direct and indirect inheritance will be\r\ndefined later.\r\n\r\nThe natural political entity in antiquity was the city, with a\r\nsmall outlying territory about it. This state of things the Romans\r\nclearly recognized in fixing the status of conquered territory in\r\nItaly and across the sea. Thus, after the conquest of Sicily, Rome\r\nmade her arrangements for ruling the island, not with a government\r\nrepresenting all Sicily, but with the sixty-eight individual cities\r\nand towns of the island, and the citizens of Syracuse or of Agrigentum\r\nderived such rights as they had, not from the fact that they were\r\nSicilians, but from their residence in the one or the other of these\r\ntwo cities.[1] This political system, based on the independent life\r\nof a small community, is familiar enough to us in the history of such\r\nItalian cities as Venice, Florence, and Siena in the Middle Ages,\r\nand preëminently in the story of Geneva under Calvin. In fact the\r\npolitical institution of antiquity which has had the longest life and\r\nwhich has enjoyed an unbroken history up to our own day is that of the\r\ncity-state. Hundreds of inscriptions from various parts of the world\r\nshow us the form of government which these municipalities had in Roman\r\ntimes. The control of affairs rested in the hands of an executive, of\r\na small assembly of chosen men, and of the whole body of citizens. The\r\ncomparative strength of these three elements differed in different\r\ncities, and varied from period to period in the history of each city.\r\nThis was the government which we find in the city of Rome in early\r\ndays. Continuity was given to it by the senate, or assembly of elders\r\nof the resident clans, who, on the death of the king, appointed one of\r\ntheir number to choose the king’s successor, whose assumption of office\r\nwas dependent on the approval of the senate and the people.\r\n\r\nThrough an aristocratic revolution the kingdom was overthrown, and\r\nthe king gave place to two annually elected magistrates, called later\r\nconsuls, who had the right of veto on each other’s actions. The consuls\r\nwere chosen from the ranks of the patricians, or ruling families, and\r\nat the end of a year became patricians again. They must therefore have\r\nbeen largely governed in their action by class prejudice. Consequently\r\nthe position of the classes which lacked political privileges\r\nbecame intolerable. Another element in the situation aggravated the\r\ndifficulty. Being located in the centre of Italy and on a navigable\r\nriver, and being far enough from the mouth of the river to be safe\r\nfrom pirates, Rome grew rapidly, and the coming of a large number of\r\nimmigrants to the city had a profound effect on its political history.\r\nThe newcomers did not enjoy the same civil and political rights as the\r\nmembers of the original clans, and they were at an economic and social\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional history of Rome for several centuries centres about\r\nthe struggle of these people and of the other members of the lower\r\nclasses to remove the limitations which were put on their rights in\r\nthese four respects. The natural method of guarding the civil rights of\r\nthe commons against the arbitrary action of the patrician consul was\r\nto limit his powers by law. But the Romans did not adopt this method.\r\nThey chose class representatives, called tribunes, who were authorized\r\nto intervene in person when a plebeian was being treated unjustly\r\nand prevent the chief magistrate from carrying out his purpose. It\r\nis characteristic of the Roman, as we shall see in other cases, to\r\ntake this concrete, personal way of bringing about a constitutional\r\nreform. The plebeians were at a disadvantage also, because they were\r\nkept ignorant of legal procedure and could not maintain their rights\r\nbefore a magistrate. The details of the law, or the accepted custom,\r\nwere known only to the patrician priests and were handed down by word\r\nof mouth from one generation to another. About the middle of the fifth\r\ncentury, after a long struggle, this law was codified and was engraved\r\non twelve bronze tablets, and the tablets were hung up in the Forum\r\nwhere they might be read by any one. These Twelve Tables[2] were\r\nregarded by the Romans as the basis of their civil liberty, and may\r\nwell be placed by the side of the Mosaic Code, the laws of Hammurabi,\r\nthe Gortynian Code, and Magna Charta. As we shall see later, they\r\ncontained no formulation of general rights, but stated clearly and\r\nminutely the procedure to be followed in civil and criminal actions.\r\nIf we may accept tradition, both these battles with the patricians were\r\nwon by the very modern method of Direct Action.\r\n\r\nThis conquest of civil rights brought the plebeians a larger measure\r\nof political rights than they had enjoyed before. It was necessary for\r\nthem now to organize a popular assembly of their own, in order to elect\r\nthe tribunes; the tribune became their political leader, and within the\r\nnext century, under his leadership, the plebeians forced the patricians\r\nto admit them to the consulship, and in consequence to the other\r\nimportant magistracies.\r\n\r\nIn early days the patricians had formed not only a close corporation\r\npolitically, but also a social caste. Sons of patricians who married\r\nplebeian women lost the patriciate, and all the social, political,\r\nand religious privileges which went with it. By the Canuleian law in\r\nthe fifth century the right to intermarry without loss of privileges\r\nwas guaranteed. Henceforth the state tended to become a unit, and not\r\ntwo separate communities, and in the future when the interests of the\r\ntwo classes were in conflict prominent patricians were often led by\r\nkinship to support the plebeian cause at critical moments.\r\n\r\nThe fourth point about which the struggles in the early period centred\r\nwas the land question. It was the age-old battle between the great\r\nlandowner on the one hand and the peasant proprietor, the tenant,\r\nand the free laborer on the other. As Rome came into possession of\r\nnew territory in central Italy by conquest or otherwise, the great\r\nlanded proprietors managed to get most of it from the state at a\r\nnominal rental. The constant wars in which Rome was engaged during her\r\nearly history called both rich and poor to the front, but the rich\r\nman’s slaves and dependents kept his land under cultivation, while\r\nthe peasant’s holdings, left without anyone to till them, steadily\r\ndeteriorated. The peasant found it hard, too, to compete with the great\r\nlandowner who farmed on a large scale and used slave labor, while the\r\nfree laborer was crushed in competition with the slave. A solution\r\nof these difficulties was sought in the Licinian laws of the fourth\r\ncentury and in later legislation. But this legislation did not reach\r\nthe root of the trouble, and the land question came up in one form or\r\nthe other for many generations to plague the Romans. The Licinian\r\nlaws, perhaps supplemented by later legislation, limited the number of\r\nacres of state land to be occupied by an individual, stipulated that\r\ninterest already paid on debts should be deducted from the principal,\r\nand fixed the proportional number of free laborers and slaves to be\r\nemployed on an estate. The first and second provisions were intended\r\nto protect the peasant proprietor and to prevent the growth of large\r\nestates at his expense. If these three measures could have accomplished\r\ntheir purpose, that drift from the country to the city which ultimately\r\nwrecked the Roman Empire, and which is one of the dangerous tendencies\r\ntoday, might never have taken place.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of Rome and her conquest of adjacent territory not\r\nonly brought to the surface the economic questions which we have just\r\nbeen discussing, but also necessitated an increase in the number of\r\nmagistrates to manage the larger population and to meet the more\r\ncomplex conditions which had arisen. In the early Republican period the\r\nonly important officials with positive powers were the two consuls.\r\nThey presided over the meetings of the senate and of the assemblies\r\nwhich were made up of the whole people, and they were the chief\r\nexecutives and the judicial and financial officials of the community.\r\nThey supervised the conquered districts of Italy, represented the\r\ncity in its dealings with foreign states, and commanded the army.\r\nThese manifold duties, and in particular the absence of the consuls\r\nfrom the city in carrying on war, made it necessary to relieve them\r\nof some of their civil functions. The first step taken in this\r\ndirection was to increase the importance of a minor police official,\r\nthe aedile. To this official was assigned the duty of keeping order\r\nin public places, of supervising commercial transactions, and later,\r\nas a natural development of these two functions, of taking charge of\r\nthe public games and of providing a supply of grain for the city.\r\nThe financial duties of the consul were turned over to the censor.\r\nFirst and foremost, of course, among these, were the collection of\r\ntaxes and the expenditure of public moneys. In order that he might\r\ndraw up a correct list of taxable property, the censor required every\r\ncitizen to appear before him every five years and make a statement\r\nconcerning his property, his business, and the main facts of his\r\nlife. Consequently the censors not only knew the financial status of\r\nevery Roman, but were also familiar with his occupation and his moral\r\nstanding in the community. Now the value of a citizen’s vote in the\r\nprincipal popular assembly depended on the amount of property which he\r\nheld, and certain occupations were regarded as beneath the dignity of\r\na senator or likely to interfere with the disinterested performance\r\nof his duty. In later times, too, inclusion in the new social order\r\nof the knighthood depended on the possession of a certain amount of\r\nproperty. It was natural therefore that the censors, having all the\r\nnecessary information before them, should assume responsibility for\r\nassigning citizens to their proper places in the centuriate assembly,\r\nand for revising every five years the lists of senators and knights.\r\nThis attempt to supervise the morals of the community is one of the\r\nmost interesting experiments in government which the Romans ever made.\r\nIt reached certain social evils, like extravagance and cowardice, of\r\nwhich the courts could not readily take cognizance, and the penalties\r\nimposed, of loss of voting importance in the assembly or of exclusion\r\nfrom the list of senators or knights, were severe. It may well\r\nindicate a gradual growth of wealth in the community and a threatened\r\ndisappearance of the simple life and the simple virtues of the olden\r\ntime. What the censors tried to do was to maintain the moral and social\r\nstandards of earlier days. While the censor’s office flourished,\r\ndeviations from those standards were not defined by law, but were\r\ndetermined by officials, from whose decisions there was no appeal.\r\nPerhaps no official in Roman history enjoyed such absolute power\r\nwithin the limits fixed by the penalties which could be imposed.[3]\r\nThe institution played an important rôle for many decades, but towards\r\nthe close of the second century before our era, the population had\r\nbecome so large that an examination of the business and the life of\r\nevery citizen became impossible. One of the objects which the Romans\r\nhad tried to accomplish by the establishment of the censorship, they\r\nattempted later to attain by the passage of sumptuary laws.\r\n\r\nThe growth of Rome and the consequent increase of public business led\r\nthe Romans to take his judicial functions from the consul in 367,\r\njust as they had previously relieved him of police duties and of\r\nfinancial business. Henceforth a new magistrate, the praetor, took his\r\nplace in the courts. To no other institution in the Roman political\r\nsystem does the modern world owe so much as it owes to the praetor’s\r\noffice. At first there was only one incumbent of the office, and since\r\nhis duties confined him to the city he was called the urban praetor.\r\nA hundred years later when a second praetor was added, to deal with\r\ncases in which one party or both parties to the case were foreigners,\r\nthe new official was styled the peregrine praetor and in his courts\r\nthe principles of the law of nations were developed. Sulla ultimately\r\nraised the number of praetors to eight. With the institution of the\r\npraetor’s office our modern court system of judge and jury was firmly\r\nestablished, and a beginning was made in the development of Roman Law.\r\nOn taking office the praetor published an edict containing the maxims\r\nof law and the forms of procedure which would govern him throughout his\r\nyear of office. This document followed the edict of his predecessor,\r\nwith such modifications and additions as his own judgment and the needs\r\nof the times required. The law in this way became a living thing and\r\nconstantly adapted itself to the changing needs of society. The later\r\nhistory of the edict and certain additions to the praetor’s duties we\r\nshall have occasion to notice in another connection.\r\n\r\nThe increase which the tribune’s power underwent during this period\r\nalmost made his office a new one. With their characteristic hesitation\r\nabout introducing radical changes in the constitution, and with their\r\ntendency to take concrete action, the Romans at the outset had required\r\nthe tribune to intervene in person when a citizen was being harshly\r\ntreated. But their common sense showed them in course of time that it\r\nwas far better to allow the tribune to record his opposition to a bill\r\nwhen it was under consideration than to have him prevent the execution\r\nof a law. This change placed a tremendous power in the hands of the\r\ntribune in his struggle with the senate and the nobility.\r\n\r\nIn the early period the senate had been composed of the representatives\r\nof the leading clans, but as public business became more complex,\r\nin making out the list of senators the censors gave a preference to\r\nex-magistrates, who were already experienced in public affairs, and\r\nin course of time this practice was crystallized into law. The men\r\nwho thus became senators by virtue of having held the praetorship, or\r\nconsulship, for instance, were elected to a magistracy, to be sure,\r\nby the people, but the prestige of a candidate who could point to\r\nmagistrates among his ancestors was so great that a “new man” had\r\nlittle or no chance of being elected against him. The results were\r\ntwofold. A new nobility was established composed of ex-magistrates\r\nand their lineal descendants. In the second place the senate, being\r\nhenceforth made up of men who had had experience in administration at\r\nhome and abroad, easily gained supremacy both over the magistrates,\r\nwho held office for a year only, and over the popular assemblies,\r\nwhich were unwieldy and ill-informed on important matters. For a\r\ncentury and a half, down to the time of the Gracchi (i.e., the second\r\ncentury B.C.), this nobility maintained itself, and Rome was ruled by\r\na parliament. This state of things is the more astonishing in view of\r\nthe fact that at the beginning of this period the democracy had won a\r\ncomplete victory, and the action of the popular assembly was accepted\r\nas final on all matters. The anomaly is easily explained by the fact\r\nthat the senate controlled the magistrates; they only could bring bills\r\nbefore the assemblies, and they dared not submit measures of which the\r\nsenate disapproved.\r\n\r\nThe ascendency of the senate during this period was due in no small\r\nmeasure to the necessity of dealing with important foreign affairs,\r\nfor which the people were not qualified. Between 287 and 133 came the\r\nwar with Pyrrhus and the acquisition of Southern Italy, the three\r\nwars with Carthage and the conquest of the Western Mediterranean, the\r\nwars with Macedonia and the subjugation of the Eastern Mediterranean.\r\nBy 133 Rome’s territory included practically all the lands bordering\r\non the Mediterranean. The government of this newly-acquired empire\r\nwas a peculiarly difficult problem for a city-state. It was somewhat\r\nsimplified however by the fact that in her ultimate arrangements Rome\r\nhad to deal with city-states like herself. In Italy, at the outset, she\r\ngave conquered cities civil rights and the right of self-government.\r\nThe Social War in 91-89 B.C. forced her to grant them the political\r\nrights of Roman citizens also. Henceforth Italy was a political unit,\r\nbut, inasmuch as ballots could be cast at Rome only, voters outside\r\nthe city were at a disadvantage. The Roman Republic never got far\r\nenough away from the tradition of the city-state to recognize the fact\r\nthat citizens could cast their ballots elsewhere than at Rome or that\r\nother communities could send their representatives to Rome.\r\n\r\nTo provide for a new province outside Italy, the senate sent a\r\ncommission of ten to co-operate with the Roman commander in drawing\r\nup a charter. In this document the province was divided into judicial\r\ncircuits, and the status of each city was fixed either by separate\r\ntreaty with Rome or by legislative action. Provincial cities were\r\nusually permitted to retain their senates, popular assemblies, local\r\nmagistrates and courts. A few of them were “free cities,” exempt from\r\ntaxation, but most of them were required to pay a fixed sum in taxes,\r\nor to turn over to Rome a certain proportion of the annual return\r\nfrom the land. The rate of taxation was not high, but farming out the\r\ntaxes to contractors, whose sole desire was to extort as much from the\r\nprovincials as possible, made taxation in the provinces oppressive.\r\nRoman governors were often in league with the moneyed interests at\r\nRome, and were themselves anxious to line their pockets during their\r\nyear abroad. After a period of experimentation the Romans settled\r\ndown to the practice of sending out ex-consuls and ex-praetors as\r\nprovincial governors. These men had experience in public affairs, but\r\ntheir term of office was so short that they acquired little knowledge\r\nof local conditions and felt little sympathy with the provincials.\r\nPublic sentiment at Rome could effect no change, because, like most\r\ndemocracies, the Roman democracy felt little interest in the welfare of\r\nthe provincials.[4]\r\n\r\nThe tribunates of the two Gracchi[5] at the end of the period which\r\nwe have been considering begin the century-long revolution which\r\nultimately overthrew the oligarchy and brought in the empire. The\r\nattention of Tiberius Gracchus was called to the gradual disappearance\r\nof the peasant proprietor from Italy, to the abnormal growth of the\r\ncity at the expense of the country, and to the crushing out of the\r\nmiddle class. He and his brother set themselves to work to remedy this\r\nsituation by limiting the size of landed estates, by assigning state\r\nlands to homesteaders, and by drafting off the city’s proletariat to\r\ncolonies in Italy and abroad. In these plans Tiberius met the violent\r\nopposition of the senate, but carried his measures through in a popular\r\nassembly in spite of the senate’s efforts. By this action, and by\r\nsecuring “the recall” of a hostile tribune, he struck a fatal blow\r\nat the prestige of the senate, which had controlled legislation for\r\na century and a half. Ten years later by securing the passage in the\r\npopular assembly of one bill to supply grain to the poor of Rome at a\r\nprice lower than the market rate, of another imposing a penalty on a\r\nmagistrate who carried out the final decree of the senate suspending\r\ncertain constitutional guarantees, and of a third which dealt with the\r\ntaxes in Asia, Gaius, the brother of Tiberius, vindicated the claim of\r\nthe popular assembly to be the controlling factor in legislation on\r\ndomestic and foreign affairs. The political history of Rome for the\r\nnext century is a continuation of this life-and-death struggle between\r\nthe nobility and the democracy, with one and the other contestant\r\nalternately in the ascendant. The development of the empire and the\r\nneed of a standing army to carry on wars abroad and maintain order, in\r\nthe end, gave a decisive turn to the struggle.\r\n\r\nTo maintain its integrity an oligarchy must keep its numbers small and\r\nmust prevent individuals from gaining too great eminence or popularity.\r\nThe traditional acceptance by the masses of certain families as the\r\nonly families qualified to furnish rulers for the state had kept the\r\nnobility a close corporation. To accomplish the second object, that is,\r\nto prevent an ambitious individual from rising too rapidly to power,\r\nfrom holding his authority too long a time, and from securing too\r\nstrong and compact a following, the senate had hedged the magistracies\r\nabout with a number of legal safeguards. The strict laws enacted before\r\nthe time of the Gracchi against bribery and prescribing a secret\r\nballot were passed to protect the nobility, and not in the interests\r\nof morality. Custom at first, and later, legislation, fixed minimum\r\nage requirements for most of the offices, established a certain order\r\nin which they must be held, and required an interval between the\r\nincumbency of two successive magistracies. The reactionary recasting\r\nof the constitution under Sulla illustrates well the aristocratic\r\npolicy in these matters. In it the important magistracies stand in\r\nthe order of quaestorship, aedileship, praetorship, and consulship,\r\nand a two-year interval was necessary between each two. The minimum\r\nage requirement for the consulship was forty-three years, and no one\r\nmight be reëlected to a magistracy until a period of ten years had\r\nexpired. This is essentially the system which had been gradually worked\r\nout during the flourishing period of the oligarchy. It had also always\r\nbeen a fundamental principle of the Republic that no magistrate should\r\nhold office for more than a year, except the censor, whose term was\r\neighteen months. This provision of the constitution took from the\r\nmagistrate his power and desire to initiate political action. He had\r\nbeen a senator for many years before becoming consul. In twelve months\r\nhe would be a senator again. He did not lose class-consciousness during\r\nhis short term of office. If he had wished to assert himself, it would\r\nhave been impossible. The senate was a body of trained administrators,\r\nmany of whom had a wider technical knowledge of the questions at issue\r\nthan he had himself. It was a body of men bound together by mutual\r\nself-interest, which had a tradition of centuries behind it. The\r\ndanger point in the system for the oligarchy lay in the fact that an\r\narmy and unlimited authority had to be given to the governor of a\r\nprovince. The senate tried to minimize this danger by keeping a tight\r\ngrip on the purse-strings when appropriating money and in voting\r\ntroops for the provinces, and by requiring governors to submit their\r\narrangements in the provinces to the senate for ratification, when\r\ntheir terms had expired.\r\n\r\nThe decline of parliamentarism in the century which lies between the\r\nGracchi and Caesar may be traced in the loss of these safeguards, one\r\nafter another. Disorders at home, the pressure of wars abroad and the\r\ndominance of the army led to their disregard. A case in point occurred\r\ntoward the close of the second century before our era. The senatorial\r\nleaders had shown great incompetence and venality in their campaigns\r\nagainst the Numidian king Jugurtha, and the popular party forced the\r\nelection to the consulship of Marius, a man of humble birth, and gave\r\nhim command of the forces in Africa. His brilliant success in this\r\nwar made the people turn to him in 104, when the Cimbri and Teutons\r\nswept down into Italy and overwhelmed the aristocratic leaders. Once\r\nmore he succeeded, and was elected to the consulship year after year,\r\nuntil, in the year 100, he held this office for the sixth time. The\r\npopularity of Marius brought his son to the consulship before he had\r\nreached his twentieth year. Twenty-five years later the senate itself\r\nwas forced to give up an important feature of its policy. Sertorius,\r\na brilliant democratic leader, had established himself in Spain; he\r\nhad formed an alliance with Mithridates, Rome’s deadly enemy in the\r\nEast, and threatened to return to Italy and restore the democracy to\r\npower. To avert this danger the senate made Pompey proconsul, although\r\nhe had not yet held even the quaestorship, and sent him to Spain with\r\n40,000 troops. A little later the Gabinian and Manilian laws, carried\r\nthrough by the democracy against the vigorous opposition of the\r\noligarchy, entrusted him with extraordinary powers for a long term to\r\ncarry on the wars against the Cilician pirates and against Mithridates.\r\nThe dictatorship of Sulla in 82 B.C. and the sole consulship of\r\nPompey in 52, both of which resulted from disorder in Rome, violated\r\nthe principle of collegiality which was one of the most important\r\nsafeguards of the oligarchy. Within one hundred years, then, of the\r\ntime of the Gracchi all the bulwarks which the aristocracy had built\r\nup to protect its position were broken down. “New men” were put in the\r\nconsulship. Popular favorites attained that office before reaching the\r\nminimum age required of candidates, and men were freely reëlected to\r\nit. The fixed “order of the offices” and the principle of collegiality\r\nwere violated.\r\n\r\nIn its struggle for power, the democracy met a reverse in the\r\nsuppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy in 63 B.C., so that\r\nwhen Pompey returned from his campaign against Mithridates in the\r\nfollowing year, the senate ventured to postpone the ratification of\r\nhis arrangements in Asia and the reward of his veterans. This forced\r\nhim to make common cause with the democratic leader Caesar, and with\r\nCrassus, whose wealth and financial associates made him a man of great\r\ninfluence. In 60 B.C. these three political leaders formed the compact,\r\nknown as the First Triumvirate, which directed the politics of Rome\r\nthrough its control of the popular assembly for a number of years.[6]\r\nCaesar was given the consulship, and later an important command in\r\nGaul. The death of Crassus in a campaign in Parthia left Caesar and\r\nPompey face-to-face. Pompey who had staid in Rome ultimately threw in\r\nhis lot with the senatorial party, and, when in 49 B.C. the senate\r\ntried to make Caesar give up his Gallic province and the Civil War\r\nbroke out, Pompey was put in charge of the army operating against\r\nCaesar. Caesar’s success in the war made him undisputed master of Rome,\r\nand before his death he became dictator for life. The liberators, as\r\nthey called themselves, made a last stand for the old régime, but were\r\ndefeated at Philippi, and the victors, Octavius, Antony and Lepidus,\r\nformed the Second Triumvirate, the members of which did not content\r\nthemselves with the unofficial position of political bosses, as Caesar,\r\nCrassus, and Pompey had done, but secured a legal basis for their\r\nautocratic power through legislation in the popular assembly. Again the\r\nelimination of one member of the triumvirate, Lepidus, and the battle\r\nof Actium in 31 B.C. left Octavius, or Augustus as we know him in later\r\nlife, in undisputed control of the state. The revolution was complete.\r\nThe old machinery of government had broken down under the strain put\r\nupon it by the policy of imperialism. Parliamentarism and the narrow\r\npolicy of a city-state were ill adapted to the government of an empire.\r\nThe large armies and the long terms of office abroad which Marius and\r\nSulla, Pompey and Caesar had held, had put at their disposal greater\r\nresources than the state could command, and the Roman citizens and\r\nprovincials who had been taught to obey them implicitly in the field\r\nmaintained their allegiance to their old commanders upon the return of\r\nthe latter to Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. POST-AUGUSTAN\r\n\r\nThe problem which confronted Augustus in revising the constitution\r\nafter the battle of Actium was not simple. He had to provide a just\r\nand efficient government for an empire, which included southern and\r\ncentral Europe, the Near East, and northern Africa, without breaking\r\naway too violently from the traditions of the city-state. Rome must\r\ncontinue to be the capital. Italy must hold her privileged position\r\nabove the provinces, and the old organs of government and the old\r\nforms and titles must be kept. The political life of the Republic had\r\nbeen embodied in two institutions, the senate and the tribunate.\r\nOne represented the aristocracy; the other, the aspirations of the\r\ndemocracy. These two organs of government formed the core of the\r\nsystem which Augustus finally adopted. In this arrangement therefore\r\nhe adhered closely to the tradition of the old city-state.[7] Other\r\nconsiderations reinforced in his mind the argument from tradition.\r\nThe tribunician power, which he took for life, could be exercised in\r\nalmost every field of administrative activity. Furthermore, the office\r\nwas popular, because the tribune had from time immemorial been the\r\nchampion of the masses and had protected the individual against the\r\nencroachments of the state. Probably Augustus also felt that the power\r\nof the office, from its nature and history, was capable of indefinite\r\nextension in all directions.\r\n\r\nOutside of Rome and Italy the problem before him was the improvement of\r\nconditions in the provinces.[8] To the provinces also he applied the\r\ndual system of control. The supervision of Italy and the management of\r\nthe older provinces were entrusted to the senate. The border provinces,\r\nwhere troops were stationed, he took into his own hands. He directed\r\nthe government of them by virtue of the proconsular _imperium_ which\r\nhe held permanently. In this case, as in that of the tribunician\r\npower, he held firmly to an old practice, because proconsuls had\r\nruled the provinces for centuries, but he extended the scope of his\r\nown _imperium_ to cover all the unsettled provinces. This arrangement\r\nmade him commander-in-chief of all the legions. He also held the power\r\npermanently, and he was not required to lay down the _imperium_, as\r\nrepublican proconsuls had done, on entering the city. The whole empire\r\nwas thus put under the dual control of Augustus and the senate. This is\r\nthe first instance in history of the establishment of a constitutional\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nThe provinces profited greatly by the changes which Augustus made in\r\nthe method of governing them. The evils of the republican system come\r\nout in Cicero’s orations against Verres, the governor of Sicily, and in\r\nthe letters which he wrote while he was himself governor of Cilicia.\r\nGovernors had been sent out to the provinces without paying much heed\r\nto their competence. They received no salary, and their terms were\r\nshort. The governors whom Augustus sent out were chosen on the score\r\nof honesty and fitness. Their terms were long enough to enable them\r\nto become familiar with conditions in their provinces. They received\r\na generous fixed salary, and those who were capable and honest might\r\nlook forward to steady advancement. The older provinces were still\r\nunder the control of the senate, but the excellence of government in\r\nthe imperial provinces exercised a beneficial influence upon them also.\r\nItalians and provincials welcomed the firm and stable government which\r\nthe principate of Augustus promised them in the same spirit in which\r\nthe French accepted Louis Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe development of the city-state into a world-empire is well\r\nillustrated by the decadence of the popular assembly which represented\r\nthe narrow, selfish interests of the city of Rome, and we are not\r\nsurprised to find the election of magistrates transferred from this\r\nbody to the senate under the successor of Augustus. As for the\r\nmagistracies they lost their independence in large measure. Augustus\r\nintroduced the practice of commending certain candidates for office,\r\nand his approval assured them election. Consequently they became\r\nsubordinates in the new executive system, of which he was the head.\r\nThe functions of government were divided between the prince and the\r\nsenate, but the lion’s share fell to the prince. The senate could not\r\nsuccessfully assert, in dealing with him, the claims which it had made\r\ngood against an annually elected magistrate of much less prestige and\r\npower. Another circumstance contributed greatly to lessen the influence\r\nof the senate. During his declining years Augustus could not attend\r\nall its meetings. Consequently he adopted the practice of sending it\r\nhis proposals in writing. They were always adopted without change, and\r\npropositions of this sort, known as _orationes principis_, became in\r\nthe course of time part of the law of the land.\r\n\r\nThe powers which Augustus held were granted to him for life or for a\r\nterm of years. It was not easy to arrange for their transmission to a\r\nsuccessor, but he cleverly surmounted the difficulty by naming Tiberius\r\nas heir to his private fortune and by having him invested with the\r\n_imperium_ and with the tribunician power. The theory of the republican\r\nmagistracy was kept intact, inasmuch as the two powers just mentioned\r\nwere conferred on Tiberius by the senate in coöperation with the\r\npeople, but the action of the popular assembly was a pure matter of\r\nform, and the senate could be counted on to approve the choice of the\r\nprince. The precedent which Augustus set was followed by his immediate\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nHe materially strengthened his position by clearly marking off certain\r\nsocial classes from the rest of the population and by making their\r\nprivileges dependent on his favor. No one could become a senator\r\nunless he had been elected to a magistracy, and success in an election\r\nrequired the support of the prince. He gave dignity to the knighthood\r\nand definiteness to its membership by making important appointments\r\nfrom its ranks, and by revising the list of knights at regular\r\nintervals. He even created an aristocracy among the freedmen in the\r\nmunicipalities.\r\n\r\nNo survey of Roman politics would be complete without some account\r\nof political life in these municipalities, for, as we have already\r\nnoticed, the city was the organic political unit in antiquity. Several\r\nmunicipal charters,[9] most of which have been found within the last\r\nfifty or seventy-five years, give us a clear idea of the municipal\r\nsystem in the West and of the efforts which were made in the early\r\nempire to improve it and make it uniform. In cities of the typical\r\nform there were two local chief magistrates corresponding to the\r\nearly republican consuls, two minor magistrates who bore the title\r\nof aediles, a senate or common council of one hundred members, and a\r\npopular assembly. The system adopted was conservative, inasmuch as the\r\ncontrol of local affairs rested largely with the local senate, and\r\nthe magistrates were its ministers. Most cities were allowed to keep\r\na large measure of self-government under the early empire, and this\r\nfact kept alive the sentiment of local pride and the local patriotism\r\nof the citizens. So long as the cities were free to manage their own\r\naffairs, the empire was prosperous. As the cities lost their sense\r\nof responsibility, or as the central government encroached on their\r\nrights, as it began to do in the second century of our era, the decline\r\nof the empire set in. It was to this halcyon period of municipal\r\nprosperity from the latter part of the first to the close of the second\r\ncentury that Gibbon pays his famous tribute in the third chapter of his\r\nhistory: “If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the\r\nworld, during which the condition of the human race was most happy and\r\nprosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from\r\nthe death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.” We need not stop\r\nto consider in this connection whether the decline of this prosperity\r\ncaused the decay of self-government or was due to it. At all events the\r\ntwo processes were contemporaneous.\r\n\r\nTo return from this brief account of city-life to the story of imperial\r\npolitics,--as we have noticed, under the system which Augustus set up,\r\nthere were two recognized sources of authority in the state, the prince\r\nand the senate. We say “recognized sources of power,” because in the\r\nbackground loomed up the sinister figure of the army, which was still\r\ncapable of determining the fortunes of the state, as it had done in the\r\ntimes of Sulla and Marius, of Pompey and Caesar. Perhaps we may see\r\nthe first step toward the intrusion of the army into politics again\r\nwhen Sejanus, the unscrupulous praetorian prefect of Tiberius, brought\r\nall the cohorts of the praetorian guard together in Rome. The control\r\nof these soldiers stationed in the capital put a powerful weapon in\r\nthe hands of Sejanus, but, before he could strike, his designs were\r\nlaid bare. The hereditary principle which Augustus had introduced,\r\nby adopting Tiberius and by conferring imperial honors upon him, a\r\nprinciple which was followed by his immediate successors, was for a\r\ntime a safeguard for the succession. But when the Julian line became\r\nextinct on the murder of Nero, the field lay open to the imperial\r\naspirant who was backed by the strongest army. After a year of struggle\r\nbetween four military leaders, Vespasian made good his claim to the\r\nprize, and in the year 69 founded a new dynasty, the Flavian. The\r\nprecedent which Vespasian had set was not followed for a century, but\r\nfrom the close of the second century to the accession of Diocletian in\r\n284 the praetorian guard and the army constituted the power which made\r\nand unmade the rulers of Rome. Within the period of seventy-three years\r\nwhich preceded the reign of Diocletian there were in fact twenty-three\r\ndifferent emperors, almost all of whom owed their elevation to the\r\nthrone to the force of arms, and kept their places on the throne so\r\nlong as they could keep the favor of their armed supporters.\r\n\r\nVespasian, whose seizure of the imperial purple we noticed a moment\r\nago, was not a native of the city of Rome, as all the members of the\r\nJulian line had been, nor did he belong to a noble family. These two\r\nfacts might almost be taken as an omen of the great change which he and\r\nhis successors were to bring about in the position of Rome and Italy\r\nin the Roman world and in the political standing of the senate. The\r\nexceptional position which Rome and Italy had held under the republic\r\nwas taken from them in part by robbing them of their privileges and in\r\npart by raising the provinces to a higher political plane. Augustus\r\nhad started the new movement by stationing troops in Italy and by\r\ntaking the municipal departments in Rome under his control. Within a\r\ncentury the same fate befell other Italian municipalities which had\r\nbefallen Rome, and they had to surrender to the emperor the control\r\nof their finances and their jurisdiction in all important civil and\r\ncriminal cases. The privilege which at first Rome and later the Italian\r\nmunicipalities guarded most jealously was their exclusive right to\r\nRoman and Latin citizenship. Claudius turned from this tradition when\r\nhe granted these privileges to certain Gallic cities, and the Flavian\r\nemperors violated it in a still more striking way by their generous\r\ntreatment of many cities in Spain. The levelling down of Italy to\r\nthe position of the provinces, so far as citizenship was concerned,\r\nwas completed when Caracalla in 212 granted Roman citizenship to\r\npractically all freemen in the empire.[10] In this connection may be\r\nmentioned a significant change which was made in the organization of\r\nthe army. The legions from the time of Hadrian on were recruited in\r\nall parts of the empire, and officers were no longer drawn solely from\r\nthe Western and Latin-speaking portion of the Roman world, but from\r\nthe East also. The army therefore ceased to be the great Romanizing\r\ninfluence which it had been in the past, and what was still worse, a\r\nfeeling of local solidarity grew up which was destined in the end to\r\nbe fatal to the unity of the empire. It was this feeling which gave\r\nrise to the nationalist movement in the third century, and the Gallic\r\nkingdom of Postumus in the West in that century and the kingdom of\r\nZenobia in Palmyra in the East were concrete manifestations of this\r\nfeeling and at the same time premonitions of the future dissolution of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nWe noticed not only that Vespasian was born outside of Rome, but\r\nalso that he was of lowly birth. Perhaps the latter fact accounts in\r\npart for the hostility which the senate showed toward him, and for\r\nthe effort which it made in the early part of his reign to assert its\r\nauthority. The movement was short-lived. The prince and the senate\r\nwere partners of unequal strength in the dyarchy which Augustus had\r\nestablished, and Vespasian soon made this fact clear to the senate. It\r\ncame out still more clearly in the reign of his younger son Domitian,\r\nwho had himself made censor for life, and by virtue of this authority\r\ndrew up the lists of senators to suit his own pleasure. The tradition\r\nof the city-state had been violated and the prestige of the senate had\r\nbeen lowered when Julius Caesar admitted provincials to the senate.\r\nThis revolutionary precedent was freely followed by emperors during\r\nthe second half of the first century. This transformation of the Roman\r\nsenate into a body made up of representatives drawn from all parts\r\nof the empire was part of the larger change of the Roman _imperium_\r\ninto an international world-state. The senate was still allowed to\r\nelect the emperor, but the election meant nothing more than the\r\nformal ratification of a choice made by the candidate’s predecessor\r\nor by the army, and “Caesar’s candidates” for the magistracies were\r\nalways elected by the senate. The senate’s legislative powers had\r\nalmost disappeared, because the senate had given up to the emperor\r\nalmost entirely its right of initiative. We have already observed the\r\nimportance which the “discourses of the prince” had acquired in the\r\nfield of legislation. Through the opportunity which they gave him of\r\ndeclaring his will, and by the issuance of edicts, decrees and other\r\n“constitutions,” as they were called, the emperor took the lawgiving\r\npower almost completely into his own hands. The one real power which\r\nthe senate exercised under the empire, long after its legislative and\r\nelectoral functions had lost most of their meaning, was its right\r\nto sit as a court, especially in important political cases. In this\r\ncapacity it had authority to impose the penalties even of banishment,\r\ndeportation, and death, but by the beginning of the third century this\r\njurisdiction, except where senators were charged with crimes, had\r\npassed to the emperor. By the close of this century the Roman senate\r\nhad completed the cycle and come back to the status which it had held\r\nin the primitive city-state, that of a municipal council.\r\n\r\nThis gradual loss of power by the senate meant a corresponding\r\nincrease of course in the influence of the emperor, but his supremacy\r\nwas assured also by positive additions to his authority in other\r\ndirections. Hadrian in the early part of the second century built up\r\na bureaucracy[11] so large and so systematically organized that it\r\nenabled him and his successors to reach into the remotest parts of the\r\nempire and control the government of municipalities and the lives of\r\nall the citizens. Probably the world has never known so complete and\r\ncrushing a paternalistic system as is revealed to us by the _Codes_ of\r\nTheodosius and Justinian in the fifth and sixth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe drift toward autocracy was greatly accelerated by the influence\r\nwhich Egypt and the Orient exercised on the development of the\r\nprincipate. Perhaps the Oriental practice of identifying the secular\r\nand divine rulers of the world never found complete acceptance in Rome,\r\nbut the erection of altars in the provinces to Rome and Augustus,\r\nthe attribution of the titles “Master and God” to Domitian by his\r\nprocurators, and in the third century the introduction into the court\r\nof Elagabalus of the Persian practice of paying divine honors to the\r\nsovereign, the presence of eunuchs in the palace of Aurelian, and the\r\nwearing of the Eastern diadem by Diocletian, show clearly enough that\r\nthe principate was taking on the form of an Oriental despotism. The\r\nconception of the emperor’s authority which these practices suggest\r\nfinds expression in the _Code_ of Justinian in the sixth century.[12]\r\nThe first words of the rescript in which Justinian authorizes Tribonian\r\nto codify the laws of the empire are: “We, under divine guidance\r\ngoverning our realm, which has been entrusted to us by the powers\r\nabove, etc.” We shall see in the next chapter that under the prevailing\r\ntheory of Roman lawyers from the second to the sixth century the\r\nemperor derived his authority from the people, but this utterance of\r\nJustinian and other passages in the _Code_ show us the beginnings\r\nof the doctrine of the divine right of kings which Rome transmitted\r\nfrom the Orient to the states of modern times. When this point in the\r\ndevelopment of the empire had been reached, the preëminence of the city\r\nof Rome had gone, the distinction between Italy and the provinces\r\nhad been obliterated, Roman citizenship had lost its significance,\r\nthe splendor of the senate and the magistracies had faded, and the\r\nmunicipalities, which had been the pride and glory of the early\r\nempire, were plunged in poverty and wretchedness. In their place is\r\nan autocrat, kept in power by an army made up largely of barbarians,\r\nwho carried out his wishes through a bureaucracy; and this, in turn,\r\nwas supported by a body of citizens divided into groups by a system\r\nof castes, and held in most cases to the soil and to their hereditary\r\noccupations by the will of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ROMAN POLITICS AND MODERN POLITICS\r\n\r\n1. ROME AND THE CHURCH OF ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the brilliant argument which Belloc makes in _Europe and the Faith_\r\nto prove that “the Roman Empire with its institutions and its spirit\r\nwas the sole origin of European civilization,” he goes so far as to\r\nmaintain that “the divisions and subdivisions of Europe, the parish,\r\nthe county, the province, the fixed national traditions with their\r\nboundaries, the routes of communication between them ... all these\r\nderive entirely from the old Roman Empire, our well-spring.” He finds\r\nin the Church of Rome the medium through which this inheritance has\r\nbeen transmitted. With this Catholic essayist the Protestant historian,\r\nHarnack, is in substantial agreement when he writes: “The Empire has\r\nnot perished, but has only undergone a transformation.... The Roman\r\nChurch is the old Roman Empire consecrated by the Gospel.”\r\n\r\nBefore we take up for consideration certain points of resemblance and\r\nof difference between our political institutions and those of ancient\r\nRome, it is interesting to stop for a moment to ask ourselves in what\r\nrespects the tradition and the ideals of the Roman state have been\r\nperpetuated by the Church of Rome. In the first place the Church is the\r\nlineal successor of the Empire in the sense that she saved Europe from\r\nchaos when the political ties which bound its several component parts\r\nto Rome were severed, and she conserved with all her power through the\r\nMiddle Ages the Roman elements which escaped being engulfed by the\r\nwave of barbarism. More than that, she kept alive the old tradition of\r\nworld-empire, no longer of the flesh, but of the spirit. Like the old\r\nEmpire her domain embraced diverse lands and peoples. She resembled\r\nand she resembles the Empire now in the fact that she follows law\r\nand tradition strictly. She requires implicit obedience from the\r\nindividual, and the interests of the individual are subordinated to\r\nthose of the organization. In all these characteristics she is the\r\ntrue spiritual daughter of the Roman Empire. We noticed a moment ago\r\nthat the realm of the Church, like that of the Emperor, included many\r\ndifferent lands. The territorial parallelism between the two systems\r\ngoes beyond this general point of resemblance.\r\n\r\nAs Sohm has put it in his _Outlines of Church History_, “the city\r\nor _civitas_ was the lowest political unit of the Empire. It became\r\nthe lowest political unit of the Church. In the constitution of the\r\nChurch the territory of the city appeared as the episcopal diocese.\r\nIn the constitution of the Empire the province, with the provincial\r\ngovernor, stood above the _civitas_. The episcopal dioceses were united\r\nin like manner under the direction of the metropolitan, the bishop\r\nof a provincial capital, forming an ecclesiastical province. In the\r\nconstitution of the Empire, from the fourth century, several provinces\r\ncomposed an imperial diocese under an imperial governor (vicarius). The\r\nimperial diocese also (at least in certain parts of the Eastern Greek\r\nChurch) formed, after the fourth century, part of the ecclesiastical\r\nconstitution, as the district of a patriarch, to whom the metropolitans\r\nof the imperial dioceses were subordinate. Finally the general union\r\nof the churches corresponded to the general union of the Empire,\r\nwith the imperial Council (the so-called Oecumenical Council) as its\r\nlegitimate organ.... Thus in its old age the Roman Empire bequeathed\r\nits constitution to the young Church.... It was its last great legacy\r\nto the future.”\r\n\r\nAnd later Sohm goes on to say: “To this day the diocese of the\r\nCatholic bishop is the copy of the Roman _civitas_; the province of\r\nthe Catholic archbishop, the copy of the Roman imperial province;\r\nand the Catholic Church under a Pope declared omnipotent by law, the\r\ncopy of the ancient Roman Empire, with its Caesars who claimed the\r\nworld as their possession.” The Church extended its limits in ancient\r\ntimes and still extends them by new conquests, just as the Empire\r\ndid. The missionary expeditions of Gregory in the sixth century, like\r\nthe Jesuit enterprises in North and South America in recent times,\r\nwere carried out in the spirit of Caesar or Trajan, and, after the\r\nChristian conquest of England, Gregory spoke as a Roman Emperor might\r\nhave spoken, when he said “In one faith He linked the boundaries of\r\nthe East and the West.” The absolute power of the Emperor in the later\r\nperiod is continued in tradition by the infallibility of the Pope, and\r\nthe remarks of the city prefect, Themistius, to Theodosius the Great,\r\n“thou art the living law,” might be made with propriety to the Pope\r\nof today. The title “Pontifex Maximus” is common to both rulers, and\r\nthere is a striking similarity between other ecclesiastical titles and\r\nthose in the official Roman list of the _Notitia Dignitatum_. Latin\r\nis the official language of the Church, as it was of the Empire; the\r\nPope consults the College of Cardinals, as the Emperor consulted the\r\nSenate; Canon Law, which has been derived in part from Roman Civil\r\nlaw, is codified as Roman Law was; the Councils seem to follow the\r\nparliamentary procedure of the Roman Senate, and the dress of Church\r\nofficials is reminiscent of Roman times. In other words, what is\r\ncharacteristic of the spirit of the organization and of the externals\r\nof the Church of Rome is a direct inheritance from the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE\r\n\r\nLet us pass now to consider the relation which our political theories\r\nand institutions bear to those of Rome. A wise government aims to\r\nstrike a judicious balance between the rights of the individual and\r\nthe safety and welfare of the community. This happy mean can best be\r\ndetermined by watching the play of the two principles in concrete\r\ncases. Such an opportunity is offered to us by the history of the\r\nancient city-state which sets before us examples in which the two\r\nideals of government mentioned above are combined in varying degrees.\r\nThese instances range from Athens which favored the freedom of the\r\ncitizen to Delphi or Sparta which exalted the importance of the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nWe owe also to the Greeks and Romans the discussion of another\r\nfundamental political problem and various attempts to solve it. Is\r\nthe ideal state a state ruled by one person, by a few persons, or by\r\nall the citizens? This question was discussed with great acumen and\r\nlearning by Greek writers on political theory, and their views with\r\ncertain modifications have been transmitted to us by Cicero in his\r\ntreatise _On the Commonwealth_. Indeed the merits and defects of all\r\nsystems of government have been exemplified in the history of Rome\r\nitself, which ran through the entire gamut of governmental forms.\r\n\r\nThe two most important Roman writers of the classical period on\r\npolitical theory were Cicero and Seneca. Unfortunately only a part of\r\nCicero’s treatise _On the Laws_ has come down to us, and only fragments\r\nof his book _On the Commonwealth_ are extant, but these two works were\r\nknown in their entirety to the early Roman jurists and to the Christian\r\nFathers, and have exerted a great influence on them, and through them,\r\nupon us. Even in their present fragmentary form they show us what an\r\nimportant contribution Cicero has made to political philosophy. Quite\r\noutside the fact that he served as an intermediary between Greek\r\npolitical thinking and that of our own times, his two works are of\r\ngreat value to us, both because of Cicero’s method of approaching the\r\nsubject of the state and because of his conception of the organization\r\nof society. Most of Cicero’s predecessors, with the exception of\r\nPanaetius and Polybius, direct their attention to the ideal state, to\r\nan imaginary commonwealth. Cicero in his _Commonwealth, De Re Publica_,\r\nII. 1. 3, tells us that it is his purpose to study the Roman state “in\r\nits birth, its growth, its maturity, and in its present strength and\r\nvigor.” In other words he introduces the modern method of studying the\r\norganization of actual states, and we have set forth, perhaps for the\r\nfirst time, the fruitful conception of the state as an organism.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the organization of society, Cicero finds the source\r\nof law and justice, not in utility, but in nature. Right and wrong\r\nare determined _naturae norma_, (_De Legibus_, I. 16. 44). This law\r\nof nature is not one thing in Rome, another in Athens; it is not one\r\nthing today, another tomorrow, but it is eternal and immutable, (_De Re\r\nPublica_, III. 22. 33). This conception of the _ius naturale_ was taken\r\nup by Ulpian in the third century and by other early jurists, developed\r\nin the _Code_ of Justinian, and handed down through the Middle Ages to\r\nour own time. It covers “that body of principles of justice and reason\r\nwhich men can rationally apprehend, and which forms the ideal norm or\r\nstandard of right conduct and of the justice of social institutions.”\r\nFrom the Civil law it passed into Canon law through the encyclopedic\r\nwork of St. Isidore in the seventh century, and gave rise to the\r\ntripartite division which Gratian sets forth in the _Decretals_, when\r\nhe writes: “_Ius naturale_ appears with the beginnings of the rational\r\ncreation, and remains unchangeable: the _ius consuetudinis_ (i.e.,\r\nthe _ius gentium_) had its inception later, when men began to live\r\ntogether.... But the _ius constitutionis_ (i.e., the _ius civile_)\r\nbegins with the principles which the Lord delivered to Moses,” i.e.,\r\nwith written law. These distinctions have furnished the starting\r\npoint in most modern discussions of the subject. Cicero defined the\r\nCommonwealth as “the affair of the people, but the people is not any\r\nassemblage of men, gathered together in any fashion, but a gathering\r\nunited under a common law and in the enjoyment of a common well being,”\r\n(_De Re Publica_, I. 25. 39). From this definition he seems to imply\r\nthat the state has a twofold purpose, to protect the individual, and\r\nto promote his welfare. In one passage in his _Commonwealth_, (_De Re\r\nPublica_, III. 13. 23), he makes a speaker in the dialogue enunciate a\r\ntheory of the state, out of which Rousseau may well have developed his\r\ndoctrine of the Social Contract: “But when one person fears another,\r\nwhen man fears man, and class, class, then, since no one trusts his\r\nown strength, a compact is made between the people and the rulers,\r\nout of which springs that which Scipio approved--a state whose form is\r\ndetermined by agreement.” This theory of the Social Compact, probably\r\nderived from Cicero, was put forth again in the eleventh century. So\r\nfar as the form of the state goes, it may be monarchical, aristocratic,\r\nor democratic, or these three elements may be combined in it, as Cicero\r\nthought they were in the Roman state; Cicero followed Aristotle and\r\nparticularly Polybius, in the latter’s discussion of the constitutions\r\nof Rome and Sparta. The views which Cicero held on this point were\r\ntaken up for consideration and emphatically denied by Jean Bodin in his\r\ngreat work on the state in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nCicero regards any government as legitimate which secures justice and\r\npromotes the well being of all its citizens, but he is dissatisfied\r\nwith monarchy or aristocracy. As the Carlyles have remarked, in their\r\n_History of Mediaeval Political Theory in the West_, which has been\r\nof great service to me at many points in this chapter in tracing the\r\ndevelopment of Roman political doctrines through the Middle Ages,\r\nCicero believed that “every citizen had in him some capacity for\r\npolitical authority, some capacity which ought to find a means of\r\nexpression.” Another fundamental social conception which comes to the\r\nsurface in Cicero, and is still more clearly stated in Seneca and\r\nMarcus Aurelius and the Christian writers, is that of the homogeneity\r\nof the human race, the brotherhood of man. To the Greeks, before the\r\ntime of Stoicism, there was a great gulf between themselves and the\r\nbarbarians. The Romans showed sometimes a similar contempt for other\r\npeople, but they recognized the intellectual and artistic superiority\r\nof the Greeks. A century and a half before Cicero’s time Plautus\r\nseriously or humorously refers to his countrymen as barbarians, when\r\ncompared with the Greeks. In other words the Romans believed in their\r\nown superiority in some fields of human activity, but recognized their\r\ninferiority to other peoples in other respects. This made them tolerant\r\nof the institutions and practices of races which were brought within\r\nthe Empire, and formed the basis of that conception of the brotherhood\r\nof man which did so much to ameliorate the condition of the lowly,\r\nand which is the ideal towards which we somewhat ineffectually strive\r\ntoday. Allied to this cosmopolitan doctrine of the brotherhood of\r\nman, was the Roman doctrine concerning the composition of individual\r\nsocieties or states. Aristotle’s theory of the organization of society\r\npresupposes the inequality of the men who compose it. Cicero believed\r\nin natural equality. We are alike, he says, in esteeming the same\r\nvirtues, in hating the same vices, in our possession of reason and in\r\nour capacity for acquiring knowledge. Seneca is almost at the point\r\nof extending this conception of natural equality to include even\r\nslaves, for, as he says in his treatise on _The Giving and Receiving\r\nof Favors_: “fortune has granted the slave’s body to his master, he\r\nbuys it and sells it, but the soul of a slave can not be bought and\r\nsold.” We shall have occasion to return to this point later, but, while\r\nwe are speaking of Seneca, it may be well to mention his explanation\r\nof the origin of the law of nature which was discussed a few moments\r\nago. The existence of the _ius naturale_ presupposes a state of nature\r\nantecedent to the conventional institutions of society. This golden age\r\nwas not one of perfection, but rather of innocence. Avarice brought\r\nit to an end. The institutions of society were made necessary by the\r\nweaknesses of human nature. This view of Seneca harmonized with the\r\nconception which the Christian Fathers later held of the condition\r\nof man before the Fall, before sin came into the world, and has been\r\ntransmitted by them to us.\r\n\r\nTo return now to the doctrine of the natural equality of men and to\r\nthe belief that the universal capacity for the exercise of political\r\nauthority should find adequate expression, out of these principles\r\ngrew the doctrine which Roman lawyers from the second to the sixth\r\ncentury have noted here and there in the _Codes_, that the power which\r\na government exercises is derived from the people. This source of\r\nauthority the emperors recognized in the _Codes_ up to the time of\r\nJustinian. As the Carlyles have shown, this doctrine was accepted by\r\nthe lawyers in the Middle Ages. It applies to judicial authority, as\r\nBulgarus of Bologna teaches in the twelfth century, and to legislative\r\npower, as Irnerius of the same century holds. Their arguments come\r\nfrom the Roman period, because they are drawn from the _Corpus Iuris\r\nCivilis_, and they borrow phrases from the _Digest_ and the _Code_.\r\nThe question naturally arose in their minds whether the people could\r\nresume their authority or not. Scholars were divided on this point.\r\nSome of them maintained that the popular will still found expression\r\nin custom, and that therefore custom could override law. Most of them\r\nbelieved that universal custom had this power, but that local custom\r\ndid not. Consequently they held that the sovereignty of the people\r\nstill found expression in custom. In passing we may note that we have\r\nhere the distinction between “unwritten” and “written” law or between\r\ncommon law and statute law. The theory that the authority in the state\r\nemanated from the people continued to be the prevailing doctrine as\r\nlate as the middle of the thirteenth century, as the Carlyles have\r\nshown. It is maintained by Nicholas of Cues in the fifteenth century.\r\nIn his _Systematic Politics, Confirmed by Examples from Sacred\r\nand Profane History_, published in 1610, the Calvinist, Johannes\r\nAlthusius, carried the doctrine to its logical conclusion that, since\r\nthe authority in a state rested on a contract between the people and\r\ntheir ruler, the people had the right to depose him and resume their\r\ndelegated power. Hobbes in his _Leviathan_, which appeared in 1641,\r\nbelieved in the principle of the contract, but in his opinion the\r\ncompact is made by the members of society with one another. The ruler\r\ndoes not enter into the covenant. Consequently he is not bound by it.\r\nThe radical teachings of Althusius lay dormant for a century and a\r\nhalf, to be taken up by Rousseau in his _Contrat Social_ and to form\r\nthe basis of the famous “Declaration of the Rights of Man” of 1789.\r\n\r\nAs Pollock has put it in his _Introduction to the History of the\r\nScience of Politics_: According to Rousseau “every man gives up\r\nhimself and his individual rights as fully as in Hobbes’ covenant.\r\nBut the surrender is to the whole society, not to a sovereign. The\r\ngovernment is not the sovereign, but a mediator between the community\r\nin its corporate capacity and its individual members as subjects.” In\r\nhis _History of the Theory of Sovereignty since Rousseau_, Merriam\r\nhas traced the development of the doctrine into our own times. The\r\nconclusion at which he arrives for our own day is that “those who\r\nadhere to the sovereignty of the general will or of public opinion,\r\nsentiment, reason, do not mean that this sovereign is at any given\r\nmoment organized to express the will of the State; they mean that\r\nit is to be obeyed, not immediately but ultimately.” Modern theory\r\ntherefore has come back to the position of Cicero and the Roman\r\njurists, although, as Bryce has said in his _Modern Democracies_, the\r\nacceptance and development of the doctrine of popular sovereignty by\r\nRome, “was due to the pressure of actual grievances far more than to\r\nany theories regarding the nature of government and the claims of the\r\npeople.” Before leaving the subject of popular sovereignty it is worth\r\nwhile noticing the limitations under which it is exercised even in a\r\npure democracy and the transformation which a democracy inevitably\r\nundergoes. On the first point, if we recall the history of the Roman\r\nRepublic which has been sketched in the preceding chapter, we shall\r\nfeel that, although Bryce is speaking of modern democracies, no more\r\naccurate description can be given of the limitations which hemmed\r\nin the Roman democracy than is to be found in his statement that\r\n“popular powers are in practice more frequently negative or deterrent\r\nthan positive. The people can more readily reject a course proposed\r\nto them than themselves suggest a better course.” Equally applicable\r\nto the history of the patriciate, the senatorial oligarchy, and the\r\nplutocracy under the Republic is his remark, drawn from a study of\r\nmodern conditions, that “nature is always tending to throw power into\r\nthe hands of the Few, and the Few always tend by a like natural process\r\nto solidify into a Class, as the vapours rising from the earth gather\r\ninto clouds. Fortunately the Class, by a like process, is always\r\ntending to dissolve.... Thus Free Government cannot but be, and has in\r\nreality always been, an Oligarchy within a Democracy.”\r\n\r\nThe opposite doctrine to the one which we have been considering, that\r\nof the divine right of kings, comes to the surface sporadically in the\r\n_Code_ of Justinian, but it is not definitely formulated until we reach\r\nthe time of Gregory the Great in the sixth century. He develops the new\r\ndoctrine fully in his _Pastoral Rules_ and in his treatise on the book\r\nof Job, as the Carlyles have shown, and it is from him that it passed\r\ndown into the Middle Ages and into later times. The Carlyles trace its\r\ndevelopment to three causes: (1) the need of checking the anarchical\r\ntendency of the primitive Church; (2) the favored position which the\r\nChurch had under the protection of the Emperor after the conversion of\r\nConstantine; and (3) the influence of the Old Testament conception of\r\nthe position of the King of Israel. The teachings of the Old Testament\r\nwere reinforced by those of the New Testament. In the _Epistle to the\r\nRomans_ we read, for instance: “Let every soul be subject unto the\r\nhigher powers. For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are\r\nordained of God,” and elsewhere: “Submit yourselves to every ordinance\r\nof man for the Lord’s sake; whether it be to the king, as supreme; or\r\nunto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of\r\nevil doers, and for the praise of them that do well,” I. _Peter_, ii.\r\n13-14. This second explanation of the source of authority in the state,\r\nwhich the phrases used by the Roman jurists occasionally suggest, was\r\naccepted by the early Church and transmitted by it through the Middle\r\nAges to modern times. The king was answerable only to God. To resist\r\nhim was impious.\r\n\r\nA modification of the theory of the divine right of kings comes in as\r\nthe influence of the Papacy increases. Dante in his work _On Monarchy_\r\nhas stated the situation clearly, when he writes: “Therefore man had\r\nneed of two guides for his life, as he had a twofold end in life;\r\nwhereof one is the Supreme Pontiff, to lead mankind to eternal life,\r\naccording to the things revealed to us; and the other is the Emperor,\r\nto guide mankind to happiness in the world, in accordance with the\r\nteaching of philosophy.” But unfortunately these two fields of activity\r\noverlapped each other, and it was not easy to say what the theoretical\r\nand practical relation of these two supreme powers to each other was.\r\nPope Leo III had placed the crown on the head of Charlemagne in Rome\r\nin the year 800. What the Pope had given in the name of the people of\r\nthe Roman world, he could take away, and at the death of an emperor,\r\nthe control of the empire returned to the hands of the Pope. The great\r\nPope, Hildebrand, in the eleventh century held firmly to this theory.\r\nAs the Carlyles have pointed out, he had a search made in the papal\r\narchives and found what he believed to be convincing evidence of the\r\nfeudal dependence of the different kingdoms of Europe on the Roman See.\r\nIn the next century the great English scholar John of Salisbury writes\r\nin his _Policraticus_: “the sword, the symbol of worldly power, the\r\nprince receives from the hand of the Church.” Feudalism inculcated the\r\nidea that each man owed allegiance to some one above him, the vassal\r\nto his lord, the lord to the prince, the prince to the Emperor, and it\r\nwas only natural to complete the system by deriving the power of the\r\nEmperor from the Pope, whose responsibility was to God. This conception\r\nof the Pope as the ultimate source of authority throughout the world\r\nwith his seat in Rome continued the tradition of the unity of the\r\nRoman Empire, which, as we shall soon see, was one of the most potent\r\ninfluences at work throughout the Middle Ages. The history of medieval\r\npolitical theory and practical politics in the Middle Ages turns\r\nlargely upon the conflict of these two doctrines, that the secular\r\nruler received his authority from the people or directly from God, or\r\nthat it came to him from the Pope, the vicegerent of God.\r\n\r\nBryce’s dictum that “every Monarchy becomes in practice an Oligarchy”\r\nsums up the story of the Roman Empire. The Emperor could not in person\r\nattend to all the business of the state. He had to organize the\r\ngovernment in departments, and delegate authority to the men whom he\r\nput at the head of these departments. This was the plan, which, as\r\nwe noticed, Hadrian brought to completion in the organization of his\r\nbureaucratic system, and we are not surprised to find in the _Codes_ of\r\nTheodosius and Justinian abundant evidence of the unrestrained power\r\nwhich this oligarchy exercised. Both the monarchies and the democracies\r\nof today are adopting the Roman plan in the one form or the other. In\r\nGermany and in certain other Continental countries before the World War\r\na highly organized bureaucratic system had been developed, while in the\r\nUnited States we have temporary or permanent Federal commissions and\r\nboards, like the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Coal Commission,\r\nand the Railroad Labor Board, and many of the States have public\r\nservice commissions. All these have been added in late years to the\r\ntraditional bureaux and departments. “Government by commission” has\r\nbecome a political catch-word, in some of our electoral campaigns, and\r\nsome of our political leaders fear that the intrusion of the Federal\r\nor State government into the matters of everyday life and into local\r\naffairs will restrain individual initiative and undermine the integrity\r\nof local government. This result, at least, followed the development\r\nof the paternal and bureaucratic system of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ON CONSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nWhile it cannot be said that the constitutional development of England\r\nand of countries whose constitutions are like hers can be traced in\r\nall respects to Rome, it may be said with truth that the growth and\r\ncharacter of their constitutions bear a strong resemblance to those of\r\nRome, and that writers and political leaders, especially from the time\r\nof the French Revolution to our own day, have studied Roman political\r\ninstitutions and have applied the lessons drawn from their study to\r\nthe political and constitutional questions of the day. In Rome under\r\nthe Republic the people when they expressed their wish in the assembly\r\nwere omnipotent, just as the decision of the English people voiced\r\nin Parliament is final. As it is in England, so in Rome the latest\r\npronouncement of the popular will rendered null and void any previous\r\nenactment or statute in conflict with it. Rome had no formal written\r\nconstitution any more than England has, but as in England such legal\r\ndocuments as Magna Charta, the Habeas Corpus Act, and the Parliament\r\nAct of 1911 are recognised as being more fundamental than the ordinary\r\nstatute, so in Rome under the Republic the Laws of the Twelve Tables,\r\nthe enactment that a citizen charged with a capital offence had the\r\nright of appealing to the people, and the principle that a _lex_, or\r\naction of the popular assembly, took precedence of a decree of the\r\nsenate, were so embedded in tradition that no measure could be passed\r\nin violation of the principles underlying them. Under the Empire,\r\nhowever, we find a document which, so far as it goes, resembles\r\nsomewhat a written constitution, viz., the “Law of Vespasian conferring\r\nthe imperium.”[13] In this document we have a comprehensive and\r\nsystematic recital of the fundamental rights, powers, and privileges of\r\nthe Emperor. As we have just seen, Rome and England have not defined\r\nthe functions of the several organs of the state and their relation to\r\none another in a single document, with which all statutes, judicial\r\ndecisions, and administrative acts must conform, to be valid, as the\r\nUnited States, France, Switzerland and most other modern nations have\r\ndone. However, the laws, precedents, and customs which direct the\r\npublic life of England and directed that of Rome in a sense make up\r\ntheir constitutions. Constitutions of this sort, as Bryce maintains in\r\nhis _Studies in History and Jurisprudence_, are flexible. They bend but\r\ndo not break under the temporary blasts of popular passion or emotion.\r\nThey have grown up with the people and are part of the fibre of the\r\npeople. Going back, as they do, into the past, they have the mystery\r\nand the dignity which antiquity gives them. The character of the Roman\r\nand of the English constitutions reflect the character of the two\r\npeoples and their likeness to each other. They bring out the practical\r\nqualities of the two nations, their respect for the past, and their\r\nability to adapt their institutions to new conditions. One more point\r\nof similarity between Roman and Anglo-Saxon fundamental laws lies in\r\nthe fact that both are concrete, and concern themselves little with\r\npolitical doctrines. Both peoples drove straight at specific abuses,\r\nwithout citing any principles of abstract right in justification of the\r\nproposed reform.\r\n\r\nIn one respect Roman government differed fundamentally from that\r\nof most modern states. The three functions of government which\r\nMontesquieu clearly recognized, the executive, legislative, and\r\njudicial, were not assigned to three different classes of officials\r\nwith as much care as they are today. Of course this lack of\r\ndifferentiation is more noticeable in the early period than it is\r\nin the later, but it persists even into the Empire. The Senate, for\r\ninstance, under the Empire not only legislated, but it nominally had\r\nthe right to elect the Emperor and the magistrates, and also sat as a\r\ncourt to hear political charges made against members of the senatorial\r\norder. Although the threefold division of governmental powers was\r\nobserved then only in part in the actual organization of the Roman\r\nstate, it was recognized by Aristotle and by Cicero in their works on\r\npolitics. The Greco-Roman doctrine on this subject was reaffirmed by\r\nBodin and Locke, as Garner has pointed out in his _Introduction to\r\nPolitical Science_, before it was set forth as a fundamental principle\r\nof political organization in the _Spirit of the Laws_. The teachings of\r\nMontesquieu on this point became a part of the political philosophy of\r\nthe French Revolution. In England Blackstone maintained, as Montesquieu\r\nhad done, that there could be no public liberty when the right of\r\nmaking and enforcing the law was vested in the same man or the same\r\nbody of men, or when the judicial power was not separated from the\r\nlegislative and executive. The makers of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates were profoundly influenced by Montesquieu and Blackstone,\r\nand probably no modern constitution exemplifies so well as does the\r\nAmerican constitution the threefold division of powers recognized by\r\nCicero. As the Supreme Court has said in one of its decisions: “It\r\nis believed to be one of the chief merits of the American system of\r\nwritten constitutional law that all powers entrusted to the government,\r\nwhether state or national, are divided into three grand departments,\r\nthe executive, the legislative and the judicial; that the functions\r\nappropriate to each of these branches of government shall be vested\r\nin a separate body of public servants, and that the perfection of\r\nthe system requires that the lines which separate and divide these\r\ndepartments shall be broadly and clearly defined.”\r\n\r\nIf we should try to set down the valuable contributions which the\r\nRomans have made to modern political theory, or the achievements of\r\nthe Romans which we may study with profit, or the political qualities\r\nin them which we may imitate to advantage, or the important political\r\nprinciples or institutions which we have inherited from them, we should\r\nthink of the doctrines of popular sovereignty, of the equality and\r\nbrotherhood of man, of the practical proof which they have given us of\r\nthe value of a flexible constitution, of their teachings concerning\r\nthe theory of the state, and of their introduction of the historical\r\nmethod of studying political institutions. Of all these contributions\r\nto modern civilization we have already spoken. We should also think of\r\ntheir devotion to the state, of their regard for law and tradition, of\r\ntheir wise opportunism which made their political thinking practical\r\nand concrete, of their development of a marvellous body of civil law,\r\nof their careful observance of the principle of local self-government,\r\nwith its acceptance of local institutions and practices, and of their\r\nsuccess in promoting law and order and a feeling of social solidarity,\r\nin improving material conditions throughout the world, and in governing\r\nand civilizing backward peoples. This is a long list, but in all these\r\nrespects the political acumen of the Romans was noteworthy, and their\r\nachievements either lie at the basis of modern civilization, as we\r\nshall see, or may furnish us guidance in our political development.\r\nIn our discussion of the different branches of the government, and of\r\nvarious fields of political activity, we shall have occasion to take up\r\nin detail many of these points which have not yet been mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n_i._ RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN ANCIENT AND MODERN\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient at the outset to compare some of the\r\ncharacteristics of the legislative branch of the Roman government with\r\nthose of modern parliaments. The Roman method of legislating was very\r\nsimilar in its essential features to that followed by the states of\r\nthis Union which freely use the initiative and referendum.[14] These\r\ntwo political devices come to us of course from Switzerland. One\r\nor both of them in their present form may be traced to Rousseau’s\r\nopposition to representative government and to his advocacy of the\r\ndoctrine of popular sovereignty. But traces of the referendum may be\r\nfound in certain Swiss cities long before Rousseau’s day, and the\r\nlegislative principle which underlies it may possibly be an inheritance\r\nfrom Roman times, preserved through the Middle Ages in the independent\r\nItalian cities. Where the referendum prevails, an elected assembly,\r\nthe Legislature in our states and the Greater Council in the Swiss\r\ncantons, is set over against the whole body of citizens, voting in\r\nthis country in their home towns, or in Switzerland at some central\r\npoint. Either legislative organization may initiate legislation, and\r\nin practice most proposals originate in the elected body, from which\r\nimportant or controversial matters are referred to the people. Popular\r\naction overrides that of the chosen body. The people may not amend\r\na proposal, but must vote “Yes” or “No” upon it. This is an exact\r\ndescription of the relation of the Roman senate to the popular assembly\r\nunder the Republic. The ancient system had the merits and defects which\r\nwe see in its modern counterpart. The assembly of the people helped to\r\npreserve the rights of the democracy and gave expression to popular\r\naspirations. The aristocratic body, being made up of experienced\r\npoliticians and administrative officials, was better qualified to\r\ndeal with technical questions and foreign affairs, and the relative\r\nimportance of the two legislative organizations varied from one period\r\nto another according to the predominance of the one set of questions\r\nor the other. Naturally the problems arising out of long-continued\r\nwars increased the prestige of the Roman Senate, just as its exclusive\r\nright to approve treaties of peace with the Central European States\r\nhas enhanced the authority of the American Senate at the expense\r\nof the Lower House. We noticed above that a few important matters\r\nwere reserved to the Roman popular assembly. One of these was the\r\ndeclaration of an offensive war. Now in the last two or three years in\r\ncasting about for some means to avert future wars, it has been proposed\r\nto take the right of declaring war from the Congress and to submit the\r\nquestion in each case to the people. This proposal has been made partly\r\nin the belief that the people who must bear the brunt of a war will\r\nlean toward peace. If we may draw an inference from the attitude of\r\nthe Roman people, this conclusion is unfounded. Professor Tenney Frank\r\nin his _Roman Imperialism_ has shown that the great war with Pyrrhus,\r\nthe First Punic War, and perhaps the Jugurthine War were forced on Rome\r\nby the democracy against the desire and the judgment of the Senate.\r\nThe Senate knew better than the people what sacrifices of blood and\r\ntreasure such wars would mean.[15]\r\n\r\nIn one of the chapters of his book on _Society and Politics in Ancient\r\nRome_ the present writer has attempted a comparison between the Roman\r\nSenate and the Senate of the United States.[16] The Roman Senate was,\r\nand our Senate is, engaged in a struggle with the executive and with\r\nanother legislative body more popular than itself for the control of\r\nthe state. The life terms of Roman senators and the comparatively long\r\nterms of our own senators put them largely beyond the reach of popular\r\nsentiment, and give them a feeling of security in their positions.\r\nThe long and honorable tradition of both bodies and their _esprit de\r\ncorps_ strengthen this sense of security. Roman senators showed for\r\none another the same senatorial courtesy which has become a byword\r\nwith us. An element of strength in both organizations is the absence,\r\nas a rule, of clôture. A measure submitted by an executive may easily\r\nbe talked to death or amended so as to bear slight resemblance to the\r\noriginal proposal, if there is little or no limitation on debate.\r\nBut two powers in particular, enjoyed by both bodies, would give any\r\nlegislative organization an excellent means of controlling public\r\npolicy and of directing the administration of public affairs. I mean\r\nthe right to confirm important appointments and to be consulted in the\r\nsettlement of foreign affairs. What a tremendous influence the Senate\r\nof the United States can exert through its right to participate in\r\nthe management of foreign affairs we have seen illustrated within the\r\nlast few years, and, as we have noticed in Chapter I, the Roman Senate\r\nheld the same position of advantage. Just as our senators control in\r\nlarge measure the appointment to important offices, so the Roman Senate\r\nrewarded with lucrative posts in the provinces the politicians who\r\nsupported its policies, and punished leaders like Caesar who opposed\r\nit, with provinces “of forests and marshes.” It may be added also that,\r\nas has been observed in Chapter I, the Roman Senate was made up of\r\nformer administrative officials who were familiar from past experience\r\nwith the questions which came before it, and the Romans did not have\r\nthe two-party system, which strengthens the hands of a government in\r\nAnglo-Saxon countries. It is not strange, therefore, that in course of\r\ntime the Roman Senate reduced the magistrate to the position of its\r\nminister, and that its policy became his policy. As in most modern\r\ncountries, the members of the government attended the meetings of the\r\nlegislative body and voted in it. It is interesting to bear the fact\r\nin mind that we have felt in the United States the unfortunate results\r\nwhich arise in the making of laws from the lack of close coöperation\r\nbetween the legislative and executive branches of our government, and\r\nit has been proposed lately to adopt the Roman practice to the extent\r\nof allowing members of the Cabinet to attend meetings of the Congress,\r\nwithout giving them the right to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ii._ DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANCIENT AND MODERN\r\n\r\nWe have been speaking of points of resemblance between the Roman Senate\r\nand the Senate of the United States. Some striking points of difference\r\nbetween its procedure and that of modern legislative chambers should be\r\nmentioned. A member of our Senate or House of Representatives, if he\r\nwere summoned to a meeting of the Roman Senate, would be as astonished\r\nat the lack of parliamentary machinery, as was the Connecticut Yankee\r\nof Mark Twain’s story at the lack of labor-saving devices in the\r\ncourt of King Arthur. He would find no fixed order of business, no\r\nquorum ordinarily required, no committees to collect facts and make\r\nrecommendations, motions not put in writing, and no minutes kept. He\r\nwould be still more astounded to find three or four mutually exclusive\r\nmotions before the house at the same time, from which the presiding\r\nofficer was allowed to make his choice. Yet no legislative body has\r\nleft behind it such a marvellous record of business-like achievement as\r\nthe Roman Senate has. This fact may well lead us to ask the question\r\nwhether the elaborate procedure and the complicated parliamentary rules\r\nwhich our legislative bodies follow are necessary for the expeditious\r\ntransaction of business. This is not to say that the Roman method could\r\nbe adopted out of hand today. That was a matter of growth, but it may\r\nat least suggest that it would be possible and wise for us to simplify\r\nour procedure. Many of the practices peculiar to the Roman Senate\r\nmay be explained out of its history. Although it is the most famous\r\nlegislative body known, in theory it was not a legislative body at all.\r\nIt was in its origin only the Advisory Council, or _consilium_, of the\r\nchief magistrate. Its members were merely the experienced old men whose\r\nadvice the king, and later the consul, sought. When he needed counsel\r\nhe called them together, and asked their opinions, following naturally\r\nthe order of age and eminence. In its outward forms the circumstances\r\nof its origin were never forgotten. The Senate never met unless the\r\nmagistrate called it together. The business of the day was laid before\r\nit by the presiding officer. Its members were not expected to give\r\ntheir opinions until he asked them, and the presiding officer who was\r\nasking advice could naturally pick out the proposal which seemed to\r\nhim wisest and ask the judgment on it of the other members, and it was\r\nthe traditional practice to make these proposals orally.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Tiberius Gracchus, near the close of the second\r\ncentury before Christ, Rome was under a parliamentary government,\r\nnot unlike the government of France or Italy in its essential\r\ncharacteristics. Under the constitution of 1875, for instance,\r\nthe chief executive of France is brought under the control of the\r\nlegislative body, just as the Roman Consul was made subject to the\r\nSenate. All his acts of every kind, to be valid, must be countersigned\r\nby one of his ministers, and it is always within the power of the\r\nChamber of Deputies to overthrow a ministry. In the absence of the\r\ntwo-party system in Rome, and the consequent lack of a compact party\r\norganization to support the Government, the Roman system was also like\r\nthat which is common on the Continent. Of course the Roman system was\r\npure parliamentary government in a higher degree than is the system in\r\nvogue in any modern state, because the internal and external policy of\r\nRome was not thought of as the policy of Catulus or Messalla, but as\r\nthat of the Senate, whereas today, with a certain measure of propriety,\r\nwe speak of the policy of a Briand or of a Giolitti.\r\n\r\nOf course the most marked difference between the Roman Senate and\r\nmodern legislative bodies lies in the fact that in the composition of\r\nthe ancient body the representative principle was not recognized. It\r\nseems to us extraordinary that when, in her early career, Rome absorbed\r\nneighboring Latin towns, and when, at the conclusion of the Social\r\nWar, she gave Roman citizenship to the cities of Italy, she did not\r\nauthorize them to elect representatives to the Senate. Instead of doing\r\nso she required the people of these places to come to the city of Rome,\r\nif they wished to vote. In view of this fact it is often said that\r\nthe Romans were not familiar with the representative system.[17] This\r\nconclusion is, however, incorrect. Traces of the system may be found\r\namong the Latins in the earliest times, in the sending of delegates\r\nfrom the several towns to the Latin Games. Twice later in the fifth and\r\nthird centuries B.C., it was proposed in the Senate to allow Latins to\r\nelect a certain number of the members to that body. The constitution\r\nwhich the Italic State adopted in the Social War seems to have been\r\nbased on the representative idea, and the system which Aemilius Paullus\r\nintroduced into Macedonia in 168 B.C. was apparently a unicameral,\r\nrepresentative government. The Romans then were not ignorant of the\r\nprinciple of representative government, but they did not adopt the\r\nsystem for Italy and the empire because, by doing so, Rome would have\r\nlost her exclusive rights, the balance of power would have passed\r\nfrom the Latins, and in course of time provincial members of the\r\nSenate would have outnumbered even the Italians. The lack of elected\r\nprovincial representatives in the Senate was made up in some measure\r\nunder the empire by the readiness which the emperor showed to listen\r\nto the requests and complaints of individuals and cities all over the\r\nworld, and by the establishment of provincial assemblies, called Κοινά\r\nin the East and _concilia_ in the West. When the Romans acquired Greece\r\nand Asia they found that neighboring cities in these two regions had\r\nalready formed religious organizations or political federations. One\r\nof these organizations, the assembly of Asia, toward the close of\r\nthe first century B.C. asked permission to establish the cult of Rome\r\nand Augustus. This request was granted, and within the next century\r\nprovincial assemblies were introduced into most of the provinces of\r\nthe East and West, primarily to conduct the services of the imperial\r\ncult and to celebrate games in honor of the deified emperor. But when\r\nthe representatives of the several cities of a province met in their\r\nannual assembly, it was natural for them to discuss provincial affairs\r\nof general interest, and in particular to consider the conduct of\r\nthe governor and the members of his staff. They never acquired the\r\nright to legislate for a province, but they exercised rather freely\r\nthe right to call the attention of the governor and the emperor to\r\nconditions in the province, and in the late empire it seems to be clear\r\nfrom the _Theodosian Code_ that they discussed questions of taxation,\r\nthe public post, and cases of extortion by imperial officials. The\r\nmembers of these assemblies seem to have been true representatives\r\nof their respective cities, and not delegates with a mandate, and\r\nin one province, at least, Lycia, they were chosen by a system of\r\nproportionate representation. The Councils of the Church were the\r\nnatural successors of the provincial assemblies. Like the assemblies\r\nthey were concerned primarily with religious matters. The Provincial\r\nCouncil, meeting under the direction of the Metropolitan, was made up\r\nusually of the bishops of the province, but not infrequently we find\r\npresbyters, deacons, and laymen present, sent by their respective\r\ncities, and from the close of the fifth century, they, as well as the\r\nbishops, often vote. Marsiglio of Padua in the thirteenth century\r\nwent so far as to assert that a General Council should be strictly\r\nrepresentative of both clergy and laity, and that a province should\r\nhave representatives according “to the number and quality” of its\r\ninhabitants, and in the following century Occam worked out a complete\r\nplan of representation for a Council. It has been suggested by Dunning\r\nin his _History of Political Theories_ that Marsiglio may have based\r\nhis proposal on the system which he found in some of the medieval\r\nItalian cities. If that hypothesis is correct, we have a double line of\r\ndescent in the later period, at least, for the representative idea. It\r\nmatters little that the political powers of the provincial assemblies\r\nwere limited, or that the bishops were the controlling element in the\r\nCouncils of the Church; the essential facts are that representative\r\ngovernment was well known to the Romans and that the representative\r\nprinciple survived in the assemblies and in the Church Councils until\r\nthe Renaissance came to give it new life.\r\n\r\nProbably no society has ever invented so many safeguards against\r\nCaesarism as the Roman oligarchy did. As we have already noticed,\r\na candidate for a magistracy must have reached a specified age: he\r\nmust hold the offices in a fixed order, and an interval of time must\r\nelapse before he can be re-elected to the highest office. His term\r\nwas a short one, and during it his actions were always subject to the\r\nveto of his colleague. Another check upon him was furnished by the\r\nrecall. This very new political device is as old as the tribunate of\r\nTiberius Gracchus. It is an application of the doctrine of popular\r\nsovereignty in its extreme form, and grew out of earlier attempts to\r\nhold magistrates responsible for their conduct in office. The arguments\r\nwhich Gracchus used in support of his proposal to recall his colleague,\r\nOctavius, postulate the theory of popular sovereignty and sound\r\nsurprisingly like the considerations which are urged by the supporters\r\nof the recall today. According to Plutarch, Gracchus said: “We esteem\r\nhim to be legally chosen tribune who is elected only by the majority\r\nof votes; and is not therefore the same person much more lawfully\r\ndegraded, when by the general consent of them all, they agree to depose\r\nhim?” Perhaps we have not inherited the recall directly from antiquity,\r\nbut our acceptance of the Roman doctrine of popular sovereignty has led\r\nlogically to the development of the recall, as well as the initiative,\r\nand the referendum.\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristic features of a Roman magistracy was the right\r\nwhich an incumbent had to veto the action of a colleague; and the\r\ntribune had the right, which he freely exercised, to veto the action\r\nof any other official. In some respects the Romans used the veto power\r\nin a more practical way than we do. Our governors, presidents, and\r\nother chief executives may not interpose a veto until a measure has\r\nbeen adopted and laid before them for their signature. Often they are\r\nrequired to disapprove of long, important measures, which they would\r\ngladly see adopted, were it not for some slight defect. Under Roman\r\npractice a bill could be vetoed before action had been taken upon it,\r\nor a tribune would ask for a night’s delay before action should be\r\ntaken. This arrangement gave proponents of a bill an opportunity to\r\nchange the objectionable features of it. In recent years various timid\r\nexcursions have been made into certain fields of political activity,\r\nin which Roman magistrates exercised their power freely. We try to\r\ninfluence the morals of people by exercising some supervision over the\r\nstage and over the public press; and in time of war the government has\r\nfixed the price of certain foods and attempted to provide for their\r\nproper distribution. What the censor’s office did in its palmy days to\r\nimprove the morals of the people and to check extravagance and display\r\nhas been discussed in the last chapter, and in the aedile’s office the\r\nRomans had a permanent Food Administration.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that the political quality of the Romans which\r\nmade for progress and stability at the same time more than did any\r\nother, was their ability to adapt old institutions to new conditions.\r\nIn the practice of assigning a board of experts to an official we have\r\nan illustration of the way in which this result was accomplished.\r\nProbably no people in antiquity used experts so freely, and perhaps\r\nin modern times the practice is not so general as it was in Rome.\r\nA magistrate was elected directly by the people each year. He was\r\nbetter aware of the trend of popular sentiment than the average prime\r\nminister. He could confidently be expected to advocate progress or\r\nchange. Attached to his office was a _consilium_, or body of expert\r\nadvisers, who were familiar with precedent and usage and who would hold\r\nfast to the _mos maiorum_. In all departments of Roman public life such\r\nboards of advisers are to be found. The king, and later the consul,\r\nhad the Senate as his _consilium_. The praetor, and, under the empire,\r\nthe emperor had their _consilia_ to assist them in the adjudication\r\nof cases, and in the field of the state religion the chief pontiff\r\nwas advised by his board of pontiffs. The interaction of the forces\r\nwhich these two elements represented resulted in the gradual reform of\r\nold institutions, without too violent a break with law and tradition.\r\nWe may regard the imperial bureaux which Hadrian brought to a state\r\nof perfection for the provinces as an extension of this system of\r\ngovernment by experts.\r\n\r\nThe Roman theory of the relation of the state and the church runs\r\nthrough a cycle. The king was both chief executive and chief priest of\r\nthe people. When the republic was established, priestly and political\r\nfunctions were dissociated, although all religious matters having a\r\npolitical significance were left to the magistrate. Julius Caesar in\r\nhis dictatorship united in his person again the functions of the chief\r\nmagistrate and chief pontiff, and this precedent was followed by all\r\nthe emperors. The Emperor therefore held somewhat the same place in the\r\nstate religion as the Czar did in Russia before the Revolution, and as\r\nthe King does in England. This assumption of religious authority by the\r\npolitical ruler was the first step toward the recognition of the Divine\r\nRight of the Emperor; and the practice of paying divine honors to him,\r\nwhich, as we have noticed in Chapter I, was introduced from the Orient,\r\nfostered the development of the theory. In European countries the Roman\r\npractice of uniting the spiritual and temporal powers has survived\r\nin the form of a state religion or in the control of ecclesiastical\r\naffairs which most states have assumed in some measure. The United\r\nStates, in enforcing a complete separation of State and Church,\r\nstands almost alone among the Great Powers in not accepting the Roman\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nOne cannot bring to an end even a brief discussion of the influence\r\nwhich the executive and legislative branches of the Roman government\r\nhave exerted on the political life of our own times without mentioning\r\nthe remarkable revival which we have seen lately in Italian Fascismo,\r\nof the old Roman spirit and of certain Roman political institutions. In\r\nits purpose, its spirit, and its external form this movement revives\r\npure Roman tradition. It began to attain its present great strength in\r\nthe months immediately following the Armistice when there was a marked\r\ndecline of national feeling and when disorder and class struggles\r\nwere rife throughout Italy. It assumed the form of a great national\r\nmovement when it broke the general strike of August 1, 1922, which\r\nthreatened the orderly life of the whole nation. The Fascisti took this\r\nstep after the government had failed to set the wheels of industry\r\nin motion again. The next step, the setting aside of parliamentary\r\ngovernment and the assumption of the dictatorship by Signor Mussolini,\r\nthe leader of the Fascisti, was inevitable. The whole course of events\r\nduring the last six months of 1922 duplicates incidents common enough\r\nin early Roman history. Disorder arises throughout the peninsula or a\r\ngreat danger confronts the state. The ordinary methods of government\r\nare suspended, and a dictator is appointed to meet the emergency.\r\nThe dictator in the olden time called the citizens to arms, just as\r\nSignor Mussolini assembled his one hundred and seventeen thousand\r\narmed followers at the Villa Borghese in the autumn of 1922. These\r\nmen of today show the same spirit of unquestioning obedience to the\r\nstate which characterized the Roman in olden time. One may well think\r\nhimself back in the third century B. C., listening to the ancient\r\nRoman soldiers gathered before their dictator, when he reads the\r\noath which the assembled Fascisti took in Rome on January 1, 1923:\r\n“I swear loyalty to Benito Mussolini, who governs the destinies of\r\nItaly. I swear devoted and absolute obedience to his government with\r\nuncontrolled conscience, which involves also the supreme sacrifice\r\nof life, the renunciation of all personal initiative, and the daily\r\npractice of iron discipline.” That this movement was directly inspired\r\nby Roman tradition is made plain by the symbols and forms which it\r\ntakes. It gets its name from the _fasces_, or bundle of rods, which\r\nthe lictor carried, as a symbol of the authority of the state, and the\r\nFascista army is organized like the old Roman army into _manipuli_,\r\n_centuriae_, _cohortes_, and _legiones_.[18]\r\n\r\nWho can say what this reawakening of the old Roman spirit may mean for\r\nItaly? It has already given rise to a new _Risorgimento_. It was the\r\ncause of Italy’s participation in the War and was the result of that\r\nWar. Italy bore her part of the burden of the War with the other great\r\nPowers of Europe. She has freed herself from the economic domination\r\nof Germany and from the threat of Austrian invasion. Her “Unredeemed\r\nLands” are restored to her. Her control of the Adriatic seems\r\nassured. Out of these achievements surged up the feeling of national\r\nindependence and solidarity embodied in the Fascista organization,\r\nwhich numbers now several hundred thousand young men, and at the same\r\ntime it was the Fasci or patriotic groups, which came into existence\r\nin the early years of the war, that made these achievements possible.\r\nThe organization has set a bad precedent in its use of violent methods,\r\nand in establishing a military force outside the state. In its dealings\r\nwith other peoples it may assert national ambitions too vigorously, but\r\nit bids fair to give expression to the national genius and to inspire\r\nItaly with a new life and vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE JUDICIARY\r\n\r\nIf one passes from the legislative and executive branches of the\r\nRoman government to the judicial, he thinks at once of Roman law, the\r\ngreatest legacy which Rome has left us. With that subject we are not\r\nconcerned in this book. But the judicial machinery of the Romans and\r\nsome phases of their court procedure are of lively interest to one\r\nwho is comparing Roman and modern institutions. Of most importance to\r\nus in this connection are the methods which the Romans followed in\r\ndealing with _crimina publica_, with what we may roughly, but somewhat\r\ninexactly, call criminal cases. For the hearing of such cases, by\r\nthe early part of the first century before our era, the Romans had\r\nestablished eight or nine courts under the presidency of praetors and\r\nex-aediles.[19] The competence of these several courts was essentially\r\ndifferent from that of our courts and may well lead us to ask ourselves\r\nif our system makes for efficiency. One Roman court, for instance,\r\nconfined itself to hearing cases of magistrates charged with extortion.\r\nOthers heard respectively only cases of forgery, or of treason, or of\r\ncorrupt practices at elections, or of peculation in office. Under this\r\nsystem each court was peculiarly qualified from long experience to deal\r\nwith the class of cases which came before it. Under our practice today\r\nwhere cases of different sorts come before the same judge, such special\r\ncompetence as the Roman praetor and his board of trained jurists\r\nattained can hardly be gained. The praetor’s court continued to about\r\nthe third century. Under the later empire criminal cases were heard\r\nin Italy by the city prefect or the praetorian prefect, and in the\r\nprovinces by the governor.\r\n\r\nThe juries which sat with the praetor in hearing criminal cases were\r\nmuch larger than ours. The smallest one of which we have any record\r\nnumbered thirty-two. A case was decided, as it is in most Continental\r\ncountries today, by a majority vote of the jurors. As used to be the\r\npractice in the Scottish courts, the Roman juror could vote that a\r\ncharge was “not proven,” but probably in the later period such ballots\r\nwere counted for acquittal. The last extant reference to juries in\r\nRoman times is from the second century after Christ. This fact has led\r\nsome modern writers to take it for granted that there is no connection\r\nbetween the Roman jury system and the modern one. Before medieval\r\nlife had been studied carefully, this was a natural conclusion. Its\r\ncharacter was not well understood, and Roman institutions were so\r\nmodified in the Middle Ages that they were not easily recognized in\r\ntheir later forms. It is also true that, until very recent times, many\r\nwho studied the origins of modern institutions did not raise their eyes\r\nabove the modern horizon, or were led by national pride to find those\r\norigins among the peoples of their respective countries. This state of\r\nthings is true, not only of the jury system, but in the case of other\r\nmodern institutions, yet a more thorough and impartial historical\r\ninvestigation is giving to the Romans the credit which is due to them.\r\nWe can do no more here than indicate very briefly the links which\r\nconnect the modern jury system with the ancient one. The character of\r\nthat system was indicated in the _Code_ of Theodosius. Much of this\r\n_Code_ was adopted in the _Breviary_ of Alaric in 506 A.D. and in other\r\nsummaries based in part on the Roman law, such as the _Capitularies_ of\r\nthe Merovingian and Carolingian kings. It is therefore a significant\r\nfact that under the Merovingians justice was administered by the Count,\r\nbut on the verdict of the notables, called in the texts _rachimburgii_\r\nor _boni homines_. These _boni homines_ were chosen by the Count, or\r\njudge, at the beginning of the hearing from the freemen assembled in\r\nthe court. The minimum number chosen was seven. Feudalism put an end\r\nto the jury in France, and in its place cases were tried by ordeal,\r\nby battle, or by compurgation on the Continent. At this point two or\r\nthree facts in the historical sequence are noteworthy. Our collection\r\nof the _Capitularies_ was made in 827. Within a century the Normans\r\nmade themselves masters of North Western France. They readily adopted\r\nFrench usages, and it is a fact admitted on all sides, since Palgrave’s\r\ngreat work appeared a century ago, that the beginnings of the English\r\njury system were brought into England by the Normans in the form of an\r\ninquest by sworn recognition. At first this method of deciding cases\r\nwas accepted only as an alternative mode of trial. Twelve knights were\r\nselected who were required to declare on oath which contestant in their\r\nopinion had the better right. The Continental countries took over the\r\njury from England after 1789. We are not concerned here with the many\r\ncomplex questions which arise in attempting to explain the development\r\nof the grand jury and the petty jury on English soil. The outstanding\r\nfact is that we owe the judge-and-jury system to the Romans.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary features of their judicial system was the\r\nfact that the Romans had no permanent public prosecutor. The bringing\r\nof criminal actions under the republic was left to private initiative,\r\nbut there seem to have been enough ambitious politicians to prosecute\r\ncases, at least those cases which were likely to bring distinction to\r\nthe successful prosecutor. Indeed on some occasions the praetor, before\r\nbeginning a trial, was obliged to give a preliminary hearing to several\r\nlawyers who claimed the distinction of bringing the charge against the\r\naccused party. The merits and defects of such a system are obvious.\r\nCharges were likely to be pushed with vigor, because the reputation\r\nof an advocate depended on securing a conviction, and sometimes a\r\npatriotic citizen prosecuted a powerful politician when a public\r\nprosecutor would have hesitated to do so. But on the whole the plan\r\ndid not work well. This was especially true when there was a political\r\nelement in the case. In such circumstances the charge was usually\r\nbrought by a political opponent, or what was worse still, a political\r\nsupporter might put the defendant on trial and secure an acquittal,\r\nbefore a real prosecution could take place. Before being allowed to\r\nundertake the prosecution of Verres, the venal and tyrannical governor\r\nof Sicily, Cicero had to convince the presiding praetor that his\r\nclaim to the right of conducting the case was better than that of\r\nQuintus Caecilius Niger, who had been quaestor of Verres, and hoped to\r\nsecure the acquittal of his former superior. Such cases of collusion\r\nbetween the prosecutor and the defendant became so common, that a\r\nheavy penalty was imposed on those found guilty of it. Even under the\r\nempire, when the senate began to hear certain important cases, there\r\nwas no permanent public prosecutor, but the senate designated members\r\nof its own body to conduct the prosecution and the defence. In these\r\ntrials the senate functioned as a jury, and the presiding consul, as a\r\njudge. As the emperor gained a greater control of public affairs, it\r\nwas not unnatural that he should take over criminal jurisdiction in\r\nimportant cases or delegate it to his prefects. When this point was\r\nreached, probably the prosecution of criminal actions was assumed more\r\ndefinitely by the state.\r\n\r\nWe frequently introduce “character witnesses” in our trials. The Romans\r\nwent still further. A Roman defendant brought with him to the court as\r\nmany prominent friends (_advocati_) as he could to make a favorable\r\nimpression on the jury. In important cases today in America, although\r\nattorneys for the prosecution and defence sometimes give the jury brief\r\noutlines of the case before the evidence is presented, their formal\r\npleas are not made until the evidence is in. Our method is inductive.\r\nFormal pleas were usually made in a Roman court before the testimony\r\nwas given. Much can be said for the Roman plan. Having the analyses\r\nof the case, as presented by the prosecution and defence, clearly in\r\nmind, the average juryman is perhaps better qualified to decide which\r\ntheory is made more probable by the facts in the case and is in a\r\nbetter position to pick out the salient facts than he is when dealing\r\nwith heterogeneous bits of evidence. The same looseness of procedure\r\nwhich characterized the meetings of the Roman Senate is found in the\r\ncourts.[20] The jury was not under careful surveillance; demonstrations\r\nof approval and disapproval occurred, violent discussions were not\r\nalways stopped, the rules of evidence were less strict than they are\r\nwith us, and technicalities played a less important part. In some of\r\nthese particulars Continental courts have inherited Roman practices\r\nmore fully than Anglo-Saxon courts have. In consequence of their\r\nelimination of technicalities, the Romans brought important criminal\r\ncases to an end much more quickly than we do, and justice was cheaper\r\nthan it is with us. In Anglo-Saxon courts hearsay evidence, the\r\nopinions of witnesses, and facts irrelevant to the issue are excluded\r\nby the presiding judge. These rules of evidence were not applied in\r\nRoman courts, and when the Continental countries reintroduced the jury\r\nsystem, they went back to the Roman practices in this matter, as we\r\nnoticed a few years ago in the famous trial at Viterbo.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. CONCEPTION OF CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\n_i._ IN TIMES OF PEACE\r\n\r\nA jealous solicitude for the rights of the average citizen is a marked\r\ntrait of the Roman character. A clear understanding of what the rights\r\nof the common man were and an ingrained purpose to protect him in\r\nthe exercise of them determine the development of judicial procedure\r\nin Rome, of law, and of political organizations. Perhaps the Romans\r\nhave bequeathed to us no greater heritage than their conception of\r\ncitizenship. With them it was not a mere dogma of political philosophy,\r\nset forth in the writings of idealists or incorporated in general terms\r\nin declarations of rights. It was made a reality in everyday life by\r\nlaw, by tradition, and by political reforms. It finds expression in\r\nthe first written law which the Romans had, that of the Twelve Tables,\r\nand five centuries later we hear an echo of it in the historic claim\r\nof St. Paul. This ideal has been before us through the ages, and has\r\nbeen an inspiration and a guide to every true leader of democracy. The\r\nlaws of the Twelve Tables, of which mention has just been made, set\r\ndown in written form and in great detail an orderly procedure, which\r\nmust be followed in a judicial action, and thus informed a citizen\r\nof his rights, and laid an obligation on the state to see that they\r\nwere observed. The Valerio-Horatian law a little later gave a citizen\r\nthe privilege of appealing in a capital case to the popular assembly.\r\nThe establishment of the tribunate provided a democratic official\r\nto safeguard him against the arbitrary action of a magistrate. The\r\ndictatorship, the “final decree of the senate,” and the other devices\r\nwhich the state used under the republic to suspend the rights of\r\ncitizens were either done away with or hemmed in by constitutional\r\nsafeguards. Cicero brings his terrible indictment of the governor of\r\nSicily to a fitting climax with the charge that Verres had caused\r\na Roman citizen to be put to death, and turning to the man at the\r\nbar he cries: _si tu apud Persas aut in extrema India deprehensus,\r\nVerres, ad supplicium ducerere, quid clamitares, nisi ~te civem\r\nesse Romanum~_? It is true that there were many slaves in the Roman\r\nworld, and that many freemen within its limits did not enjoy the full\r\nrights of Roman citizenship until late in the imperial period, but\r\nthese facts do not weaken the point in which we are interested here.\r\nWherever he went a citizen had behind him the sovereignty of the Roman\r\nstate. Any community which wronged him must make restitution, or it\r\nwould feel the heavy hand of Rome. This Roman principle that a state\r\nmay protect its citizens even in a foreign land has been accepted by\r\nmodern nations and is jealously observed by them. In fact international\r\nrelations are concerned in large measure with the protection by a\r\nstate of its citizens or subjects residing in foreign countries. Their\r\npassports certify to their citizenship. They may appeal to their\r\nminister or ambassador when they think themselves wronged, and may\r\nlook with confidence for the support of the army and navy of their\r\nrespective countries, when their lives, liberty, or property are\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ii._ IN TIMES OF WAR\r\n\r\nWe have just been considering the fortunate position of the Roman\r\ncitizen in times of peace. When wars arose, he became the servant of\r\nthe state. Unlike the Carthaginians, the Romans did not during the\r\nperiods of the Great Wars, employ mercenaries. Service in the army was\r\ncompulsory on all citizens between seventeen and forty-six years of age\r\nwho had property of a certain amount. Those who avoided service were\r\nliable to have their property confiscated, or to be sold as slaves, and\r\ndesertion was a capital offence. Discipline was strict, and punishments\r\nwere severe. But at the end of a campaign the soldier returned to\r\ncivil life. Before the close of the third century B.C., however, the\r\nterritory of Rome extended beyond the sea, and a soldier’s term of\r\nservice was correspondingly lengthened. This fact made the well-to-do,\r\nwho were already disinclined to service in the army, still more opposed\r\nto it. This was the situation which led Marius to substitute voluntary\r\nenlistment for conscription toward the end of the second century. The\r\nnew plan quickly filled the ranks of the army. The needy and the\r\nadventurous found a soldier’s career attractive. They accepted it as\r\ntheir life’s work. Their home was the camp. “_Esprit de corps_ took\r\nthe place of patriotism.” As I have remarked in my _Roman Political\r\nInstitutions_: “Henceforth the soldiers who came back to the city\r\nafter protracted campaigns did not look on their commander, as their\r\nfathers had done, as a simple fellow-citizen, who had like themselves\r\nbeen serving the state, and now resumed his place by their side. Long\r\nperiods of service abroad under the direction of one man had led them\r\nto follow implicitly the guidance of an individual.” The veterans of\r\nMarius, of Sulla, of Pompey, and of Caesar could be trusted to follow\r\nat home the political leadership of the man under whom they had served\r\nabroad. This situation threw the control of politics into the hands of\r\nthose who commanded the largest armies. What was still worse, the state\r\ncould no longer count on the fidelity of its soldiers. Their allegiance\r\nhad been transferred from Rome to their commander-in-chief, and the\r\nsecurity of the government itself might depend on his loyalty or his\r\nlack of political ambition. From the beginning of the first century\r\nbefore Christ to the end of the empire the sinister figure of the army\r\nis ever in the background. It was a disturbing force in politics, as we\r\nhave just seen, by giving political offices and an undue influence to\r\nmilitary men without regard to their fitness for political leadership,\r\nand by organizing forcible interference with public meetings of which\r\nthe veterans disapproved; and the claims which the soldiers made for\r\nlands and bonuses often put the government in a difficult position.\r\nOf some of these evils, of which we have been painfully aware in this\r\ncountry after our various wars, we shall have occasion to speak in the\r\nnext chapter. Fortunately in our history the army has never threatened\r\nthe existence of a stable government or been used to overthrow it, as\r\nit was used in Rome in the year 68-69 and almost constantly during the\r\nthird century of our era.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. TAXATION AND FINANCE\r\n\r\nIn the fields of taxation and public finance we have not much to\r\nlearn from the Romans, save by way of warning. Most of the revenue\r\nof the state came from the provinces, and for several centuries was\r\ncollected by tax-farmers.[21] We are familiar enough in more recent\r\ntimes with the exploitation of provinces, or colonies, as we call\r\nthem, by the state or the great trading company, because most modern\r\nnations have followed Rome’s policy of making their colonies subserve\r\nthe interests of the mother country. In Sicily, the first overseas\r\nterritory which the Romans acquired, they took over the system of\r\ntaxation which they found in vogue there. That system rested on the\r\nOriental theory that the land belonged to the sovereign, and that those\r\nwho held the land paid rent for its use. This was the basis of taxation\r\nin all the later provinces also. Next in importance to the tribute\r\nwere the customs duties. They brought in a large revenue, but were a\r\ngreat impediment to trade. Rome held almost all the civilized world.\r\nConsequently duties collected on the frontiers of the empire would not\r\nhave amounted to much. What the Romans did was to divide the empire\r\ninto tariff districts, and collect duties from those entering these\r\ndistricts. Trade suffered in consequence, as it did in France before\r\nthe Revolution under similar conditions. The only other important tax\r\nin this connection was the five per cent inheritance tax imposed\r\non property left to others than near relatives. It was instituted\r\nby Augustus, was levied on Roman citizens, and met with violent\r\nopposition. This system, taken in its entirety, relieved Italy from the\r\nburden of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe grant of Roman citizenship to practically all freemen in the\r\nprovinces by Caracalla in 212 was therefore a severe blow to Italy,\r\nbecause it raised the provinces to the level of the peninsula, and\r\npaved the way for Diocletian to apply his fiscal reforms to the\r\nwhole Roman world.[22] His system of taxation was one of the most\r\ncomplete and methodical that has ever been known. We can speak of\r\nonly a few of its salient features here. The population was divided\r\ninto three classes, the owners of land or other property, merchants,\r\nand laborers. For the first class, the class most important for the\r\npurpose of taxation, the fiscal unit was the _caput_ or _iugum_. The\r\n_caput_ was the working power of a man in good health. A _iugum_ was\r\na piece of land from which a fixed return might be expected. The\r\nnumber of _capita_ and _iuga_ was determined by a careful census at\r\nfixed intervals, and each land owner paid according to the number of\r\nlaborers and _iuga_ on his estate. The tax paid by merchants depended\r\non the capital invested in their business. Laborers paid a poll tax.\r\nThe plan was well thought out, but the failure of the government to\r\nreduce the valuation of property as the prosperity of the empire\r\ndeclined, and its inability to reduce its own expenses made the taxes\r\nan intolerable burden, and contributed largely to impoverish the people\r\nand ruin local self-government. The Roman system of taxation, with some\r\nmodifications, continued in use after the dissolution of the Empire and\r\nexerts an influence on our modern systems. Duties were still collected\r\non wares in transit at frontiers, at bridges and at other points on the\r\npublic highways. A quota of the produce was required from the owners of\r\nland, and the property of those who died without leaving a will went\r\nto the crown. It is clear that most of the Roman taxes, for instance,\r\ncustoms duties, the inheritance tax, a tax on landed property, and a\r\npoll tax, have been taken over by us, and find a place in our modern\r\nsystems of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe funds which came into the imperial treasury from the different\r\nsources mentioned above were spent mainly on the government of the\r\nprovinces, on roads, bridges, and other public works, on religion, on\r\nthe army and navy, and on the city of Rome. It is impossible to find\r\nout the size of these different items. It has been calculated that in\r\nthe early part of the first century the army cost 160,000,000 sesterces\r\na year, a sum which, with some hesitation, one may roughly estimate\r\nhad the purchasing value of $8,000,000. An imperial procurator in one\r\nof the provinces received an annual salary which ranged from $3,000\r\nto $15,000. The expense of provincial government was tremendously\r\nincreased from the second century on by the development of an\r\nelaborate bureaucratic system. The outgo for the city of Rome included\r\nexpenditures for the construction and maintenance of public works, for\r\nreligious purposes, and to provide food and amusement for the populace.\r\nWe notice the absence from the list of charges of certain items like\r\nappropriations for education and charity which form an important part\r\nof a modern budget.\r\n\r\nUnder the republic the control of finances rested mainly with the\r\nsenate; under the empire it was divided between the emperor and the\r\nsenate. The republican system of financial administration would\r\nseem to us very loose, and surprising in the case of so practical a\r\npeople as the Romans. Under it the senate appropriated money for a\r\nperiod of five years to be used by the censors in the construction of\r\npublic works, and lump sums were voted for expenditure by the other\r\ncivil magistrates, and itemized accounts were not required of them.\r\nAs happened in so many other matters, with the empire a better system\r\nof financial administration came in. The government collected most\r\nof the taxes through its own agents. The supervision of receipts and\r\nexpenditures was more thorough, and we hear of something approaching\r\nan itemized budget. The lion’s share of the revenues went into the\r\nimperial fiscus. The funds at the emperor’s disposal were also\r\nmaterially augmented by the development of crown property and of the\r\nemperor’s private fortune. Many large private estates were confiscated\r\nby the emperor, and many legacies were left to him. Indeed it was often\r\na hazardous thing for a rich man to pass over the emperor in his will.\r\nThe hereditary principle of succession was never formally recognized in\r\nthe Roman constitution, but it was practically followed from Augustus\r\nto Nero, so that the interesting distinction which we make today\r\nbetween crown property and the patrimony of the emperor was not adopted\r\nbefore the year 69.\r\n\r\nThe minting of Roman money had the same history as the control of the\r\nbudget. The senate had charge of it under the republic. Under the\r\nempire the emperor directed the gold and silver coinage; the senate\r\nissued bronze coins. Two episodes in the history of Roman coinage are\r\nof interest to the student of modern economic conditions. If Professor\r\nFrank’s conclusions in a recent number of _Classical Philology_[23]\r\nare correct, Rome had a real bimetallic standard from 340 to 150\r\nB.C. This was maintained by changing from time to time the amount of\r\nmetal entering respectively into the silver and bronze coins of the\r\nperiod in question. The Roman system did not, however, involve the\r\nfree and unlimited coinage of both metals, because the state limited\r\nits issue of money to the estimated needs of the community. The other\r\nincident occurs under the empire. It has its parallel in the unlimited\r\nissue of paper money today by many European governments. The Roman\r\ngovernment was hard pressed to meet its obligations. It did so by\r\ndebasing the coinage. This process was carried so far that in the\r\nthird century it refused to receive its own silver coins in payment\r\nof taxes. Constantine brought order out of this confusion, by making\r\nthe gold _solidus_ the standard. This coin became the parent of the\r\ngold coinages both of the East and the West. It was accepted by the\r\nbarbarian states. From the time of Pepin it was struck in silver and\r\nwas current until 1793. The modern French word _sou_ is of course an\r\nabbreviation of its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. IMPERIALISM\r\n\r\nOf all Rome’s achievements in the field of politics none was so\r\nfar-reaching in its influence and so lasting in its effects as her\r\nconquest of the world and her successful government of it for five\r\nhundred years or more. With the story of her conquests we are not\r\nconcerned here. But, as President Butler of Columbia University has\r\nsaid in his _Annual Report_ for 1921: “No educated citizen of a modern\r\nfree state can afford to ignore the lessons taught by the Roman Empire,\r\nwhich for centuries held together in a commonwealth that was both\r\nprosperous and contented peoples widely differing in religious faith,\r\nin racial origin, and in vernacular speech.” How did she weld them\r\nall, Britons, Gauls, Spaniards, and Africans, into one people whose\r\nfeeling of unity was so strong that even in the intervening centuries\r\nit has not died out altogether? No national heroes will ever supplant\r\nTrajan or Ovid in the hearts of the Roumanian people. When the Italians\r\ninvaded Tripoli a few years ago they thought of themselves as following\r\nin the footsteps of their great ancestors, and a political cartoon\r\nwhich had wide vogue in Italy at the time of the war and did much to\r\nstimulate enthusiasm for it showed a shadowy Roman commander, perhaps\r\nScipio, landing in Africa at the head of an Italian army. How few\r\nmodern empires can hope to establish such traditions as these, so far\r\nas peoples of alien races and religions are concerned! That the Romans\r\nwere more successful in developing a feeling of solidarity and loyalty\r\nthroughout their empire than modern nations have been, we have the\r\ntestimony from different points of view of such competent judges as\r\nLord Cromer and Boissier. In his _Ancient and Modern Imperialism_ Lord\r\nCromer says: “If we turn to the comparative results obtained by ancient\r\nand modern imperialists; if we ask ourselves whether the Romans, with\r\ntheir imperfect means of locomotion and communication, their relatively\r\nlow standard of public morality, and their ignorance of many economic\r\nand political truths, which have now become axiomatic, succeeded as\r\nwell as any modern people in assimilating the nations which the prowess\r\nof their arms had brought under their sway, the answer can not be\r\ndoubtful. They succeeded far better.” Elsewhere he remarks that “there\r\nhas been no thorough fusion, no real assimilation between the British\r\nand their alien subjects, and, so far as we can now predict, the future\r\nwill in this respect be but a repetition of the past.”\r\n\r\nNot only is this unparalleled achievement of the Romans worthy\r\nof notice from the historical point of view, but the methods of\r\nassimilation and government which gave them their success should be\r\npeculiarly interesting and instructive to us in these days of fierce\r\nnational rivalry for the control of undeveloped lands and natural\r\nresources. It is only fair to say that the Romans were more successful\r\namong the semi-civilized peoples of the West than they were in the\r\nGreek East. It is also true that most of the peoples within the\r\nlimits of the empire were of the white races, and that towards the\r\ndark races the Romans do not seem to have shown the same repugnance\r\non the score of color which modern white peoples show. Furthermore,\r\nthe acceptance of polytheism in the ancient world facilitated the\r\namalgamation of two alien peoples, because each of them was tolerant\r\nof the religion of the other and readily received the other’s deities\r\ninto its pantheon, whereas, as we know, the monotheistic creeds of\r\nmodern conquering peoples, like Christianity and Mohammedanism, stand\r\nas a barrier between the conquerors and the conquered. In addition to\r\nthe concrete civilizing agencies which they employed, and which we\r\nshall have occasion to notice in a moment, we may find the grounds of\r\ntheir success in certain mental and political qualities and habits.\r\nThe Romans were not idealists. Consequently they did not try to foist\r\na new political and social system on a conquered people. Indeed they\r\nwere intellectually phlegmatic and drew back from the task of thinking\r\nout a political system in its entirety. They lacked alertness of mind\r\nand were not much interested in political philosophy. Their policy\r\nat home and abroad was that of opportunism. When they acquired a new\r\nterritory, therefore, they were content to introduce a few general\r\narrangements and then allow the conquered people to go on living\r\ntheir own life, retaining their old religion, customs, practices, and\r\nlocal institutions. Besides adopting this wise policy of tolerance,\r\nin the best period of provincial government the Romans followed sound\r\nadministrative principles. They established a graded civil service,\r\nwith reasonable hope of promotion for competent officials. In this\r\nway they developed a corps of experienced administrators. They paid\r\nadequate salaries to provincial governors and their subordinates,\r\nand secured them reasonably well against removal on purely political\r\ngrounds. The home government kept a close supervision of provincial\r\nofficials, and courts were provided for the trial of charges brought\r\nagainst them. So far as we know, these wise principles for the\r\ngovernment of dependencies were first put into application by the\r\nRomans, and few, if any, of our modern empires are observing them with\r\nthe same care that certain Roman emperors did.[24]\r\n\r\nAlong with a good administrative system went protection of life and\r\nproperty and the gradual extension of Roman law. The patience and\r\nmoderation of the Roman come out with special clearness in the last\r\nmatter. In spite of the supreme regard in which he held his own law,\r\nthe Roman allowed provincial cities of native origin to retain their\r\nown local codes. Only colonies were required to adopt Roman law, but,\r\nsince the colony enjoyed special privileges, native communities were\r\noften eager to gain the status of colonies, and with that status went\r\nthe willing acceptance of Roman law. The everyday life of the Spaniard\r\nor the African under Roman rule went on as it had before. He carried on\r\nhis daily occupations as in the past. He worshipped his native gods,\r\nand took part in his city’s traditional festivals and merrymakings. If\r\nsome one infringed on his rights, he brought action under the old-time\r\nlaws before magistrates of his own choosing. Some general changes,\r\nhowever, which came with Roman rule materially improved his condition.\r\nHis taxes were usually less than they had been before the Romans\r\ncame. His life and property were safer. Trade developed, and he saw\r\nhis native town grow. This wise treatment tended in time to make the\r\nnatives of the West look on the Roman government with a friendly eye.\r\n\r\nBut the Romans used positive agencies in civilizing and Romanizing\r\nnewly conquered peoples. The most effective of these agencies were\r\nthe building of roads, the introduction of Latin, and the founding of\r\ncolonies. The success of modern imperialist states has been determined\r\nin large measure by their wise or unwise use of these means of\r\ndeveloping a dependency and of binding it to the rest of the empire,\r\nbut we have much to learn in all three of these matters from Roman\r\nmethods. The first of the great Roman roads, the Appian Way, was built\r\nin 312 B.C., near the close of the conquest of Central Italy. It ran\r\nfrom Rome to Capua, and was soon extended to the port which today\r\nbears the name of Brindisi. Before the close of the second century\r\nB.C. four other great highways had been constructed connecting Rome\r\nwith Genoa, Reggio, Rimini and other points in Northern Italy. From\r\nthese trunk-lines, branch roads were then built to large towns not\r\nsituated on the main highway. This network of roads connected all the\r\nimportant districts of Italy with one another and with Rome. Those who\r\nhave seen the remains of the Appian Way or of other Roman roads know\r\nhow well they were built. The policy which was adopted for Central\r\nItaly, for Southern Italy, and for Northern Italy, as section after\r\nsection of the peninsula yielded to Roman arms, was carried into the\r\nprovinces. A map of Spain, for instance, at the close of the reign of\r\nAugustus showing the system of roads laid out by his engineers proves\r\nhow thorough the Romans were in their plans for the pacification of\r\nthe country and the development of its resources. These roads in the\r\nprovinces, like the Trans-Siberian railway, were built first of all for\r\nmilitary purposes. They made it easy to send troops and supplies to all\r\nparts of the empire. But they served a larger purpose in facilitating\r\ntrade, in bringing remote regions into closer communication with one\r\nanother and with Rome, and in developing a common way of living and of\r\nthinking throughout the world. In other words they helped to make the\r\nempire a unit. Even after the political bonds which held the Empire\r\ntogether had been relaxed, the roads were left. They made trade and\r\ntravel possible. They furnished a ready means of communication between\r\ndifferent parts of the world, and exerted a powerful influence in\r\npreserving for us the features of Roman civilization.[25]\r\n\r\nOne reason why the Romans surpassed modern imperialist states in their\r\nuse of this effective civilizing agency is the fact that they employed\r\ntheir legionaries and auxiliaries in times of peace in the construction\r\nof roads and other public works. The story of the Third Augustan Legion\r\nin Africa, as Reid outlines it in his _Roman Municipalities_, is\r\nilluminating.[26] This legion was stationed in Northern Africa for a\r\ncentury and a half or two centuries, and from the numerous inscriptions\r\nwhich the French have brought to light there we can see the beneficent\r\nresults of its labors throughout the province. In addition to the roads\r\nwhich it built, and the chains of forts, which it constructed along\r\nthe frontier, there were at least five large towns which owed their\r\nconstruction almost entirely to the soldiers of the Third Legion.\r\nThey developed the town of Theveste and constructed all the public\r\nbuildings in it. When the surrounding country became peaceful and\r\nprosperous, the legion moved on to a new outpost, always enlarging the\r\nsphere of Roman influence. This is the history of Timgad. At first it\r\nwas a military post, established to check raids by nomad tribes through\r\nthe mountains. The soldiers constructed temples, baths, and all the\r\nother public buildings needed in a Roman city, and by 100 A.D. its\r\nimportance was recognized by its elevation to the proud position of a\r\nRoman colony. In all parts of the Empire we find inscriptions recording\r\nthe building by the soldiers of roads, bridges, amphitheatres,\r\naqueducts, and harbors. Whether soldiers in modern times could be used\r\nfor such purposes is doubtful, but we can at least see in the use which\r\nthe Romans made of their soldiers one reason for their success as\r\nempire-builders.\r\n\r\nIn another way the soldiers played an important part in Romanizing\r\nnewly conquered territory. Near every important garrison _canabae_,\r\nor settlements of merchants and camp-followers, sprang up. Many of\r\nthe auxiliaries married native women, who made their homes in these\r\nvillages. At the end of their term of service these foreign soldiers\r\nwere made Roman citizens. Their marriages with native women were\r\nlegalized, and they settled down in these communities on the frontier,\r\nto introduce Roman ideas and Roman institutions in the surrounding\r\ncountry. When we remember that there were probably 200,000 auxiliary\r\ntroops in the second century, we can readily understand what a great\r\ninfluence their settlement in the provinces must have had. In this\r\nconnection it is convenient to speak of the “organizations of Roman\r\ncitizens,” or the _conventus civium Romanorum_, as they were called.\r\nAs soon as a new province had been acquired, Roman bankers, merchants,\r\nship-owners, and publicans went to it and settled in the important\r\ncities. They quickly formed an organization of their own in the\r\ncommunity where they lived, because it was natural for Romans to form\r\na political or social organization, and because certain rights and\r\nprivileges which they had set them off from the rest of the community.\r\nThey made up the aristocracy of the towns where they lived, and many\r\nnatives must have been spurred on to accept Roman ideas and attain\r\nRoman citizenship for the sake of being enrolled in the _conventus_.\r\nThe trade which these merchants carried on, and which a fine system of\r\nroads made possible, had a levelling influence throughout the Empire.\r\nItaly and Gaul sent their pottery and bronze utensils, Syria its silk\r\nand linen, Egypt its cotton goods and ivory, and Arabia its gums and\r\nspices to all the great centres of the world. The articles of everyday\r\nuse and many articles of luxury were, therefore, the same in all the\r\nprovinces, and must have had a great influence in making the daily life\r\nof all the people under Roman rule uniform. Trade usually “followed the\r\nflag,” but in some cases enterprising Roman merchants went in advance\r\nof it. Trajan found them in the capital of Parthia when he took that\r\ncity, and there was an “organization of Roman citizens” in Alexandria\r\nlong before Rome established a protectorate over Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn his _Ancient and Modern Imperialism_ Lord Cromer remarks: “Modern\r\nImperialist nations have sought to use the spread of their language in\r\norder to draw political sympathy to themselves. This has been notably\r\nthe case as regards the French in the basin of the Mediterranean,\r\nand--though perhaps less designedly--as regards the English in India.\r\nI do not think that either nation is likely to attain any great\r\nmeasure of success in this direction. They will certainly be much\r\nless successful than the Romans. Neither in French, British, nor, I\r\nthink I may add, Russian possessions is there the least probability\r\nthat the foreign will eventually supplant the vernacular languages.”\r\nElsewhere he says: “(My) conclusion is that the great proficiency\r\nin some European language often acquired by individuals amongst the\r\nsubject races of the modern Imperialist Powers in no way tends to\r\ninspire political sympathy with the people to whom that language is\r\ntheir mother tongue.... Indeed, in some ways, it (i.e., language)\r\nrather tends to disruption, inasmuch as it furnishes the subject races\r\nwith a very powerful arm against their alien rulers.” This frank\r\nconfession by a competent authority that the languages of the dominant\r\nnations are not making much progress among the subject races, and that\r\nproficiency in them tends often to alienate the conquered people from\r\ntheir rulers, a fact which we have seen illustrated lately in the case\r\nof the leaders of the revolutionary movements in India, brings into\r\nstriking relief not only the remarkable success which the Romans had\r\nin making Latin the common language of the western world but also\r\nthe effective use which they made of it in unifying the Empire. In\r\ntwo chapters of my book on _The Common People of Ancient Rome_ I have\r\ntried to show what the nature of this language was and how it spread\r\nthrough the Empire.[27] In Dacia, or modern Roumania, for instance, a\r\nprovince beyond the Danube, which the Romans held for only one hundred\r\nand seventy-five years, Latin was so firmly established that it has\r\npersisted in its modern form to the present day. In his _Romanization\r\nof Roman Britain_ Haverfield has shown for this remote province from a\r\nstudy of the ephemeral inscriptions on bricks and tiles that “Latin was\r\nemployed freely in the towns of Britain, not only on serious occasions\r\nor by the upper classes, but by servants and work-people for the most\r\naccidental purposes.” The missionaries who carried it throughout the\r\nancient world were the soldier, the colonist, the trader, and the\r\nofficial. It surprises one to find out, also, that all classes could\r\nnot only speak Latin, but could read and write it. Across the Empire\r\nfrom Britain to Dacia it is the same story. On the tombstones of the\r\npetty merchant and the freedman, as well as on the bronze tablets\r\nwhich contain laws and decrees, the language is Latin, and essentially\r\nthe same Latin as one would hear in the city of Rome. It is clear that\r\nmodern Imperialist states have much to learn from the methods which\r\nRome employed so successfully in furthering the use of her language\r\nby subject races. Lord Cromer regrets the fact that acquaintance\r\nwith the tongue of the ruling people often becomes in modern times a\r\nweapon which is turned against that people. In the Roman provinces it\r\nconferred distinction, opened the way to fuller rights and privileges\r\nand made the possessor of it a stronger supporter of the Roman régime.\r\n\r\nNothing brings out better the great contrast between the individualism\r\nof modern times and the solidarity of the Roman commonwealth than a\r\ncomparison of the methods followed now and two thousand years ago in\r\nsettling an undeveloped country.[28] Reports of the great resources of\r\nAlaska come to Oregon and Colorado and New York. Men from all quarters\r\nhurry there indiscriminately. On some promising location a village\r\ngrows up, almost over night. It has no magistrates, no common council.\r\nSome of the more public-spirited citizens gradually band themselves\r\ntogether to preserve order and dispense a rude justice. In time a\r\nmunicipal government is organized. The Roman method of occupying a\r\nnew territory was far different from this. It consisted primarily in\r\nthe establishment of colonies in the new region. The most desirable\r\nlocations for strategic and commercial reasons were picked out, and a\r\nlaw was passed in the popular assembly authorizing the establishment\r\nof a colony, and providing for commissioners to found it. From three\r\nhundred to several thousand colonists were then enrolled, and marched\r\nout in military order to the chosen site. The commissioners assigned\r\nthe allotments, drew up a charter for the new community, and appointed\r\nits first magistrates and the members of the local senate. This compact\r\nand highly organized community of Romans served as a military outpost\r\nand a centre for the extension of Roman civilization. The complete\r\npacification and Romanization of Italy was largely due to the influence\r\nof these colonies. More than four hundred and forty such communities\r\nwere established in Italy and the provinces. Modern empires have much\r\nto learn from this feature of Roman policy, and it would almost\r\nseem as if we were beginning to appreciate its value. The State of\r\nCalifornia has in late years adopted a system of colonization closely\r\nresembling the Roman. It selects a site, appoints experts to subdivide\r\nthe land, chooses the colonists carefully, and sends the colony out\r\nunder a board of directors. Under a measure proposed by the United\r\nStates Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Lane, a year or two ago,\r\nbut not yet adopted by the Congress, similar settlements were to be\r\nestablished on government land by the coöperation of the federal and\r\nstate governments. An interesting experiment along Roman lines, but\r\nunder private auspices, was made in July, 1921, when an organized band\r\nof selected colonists set out from Brooklyn to found a settlement in\r\nIdaho, with the coöperation of that state.[29] The advantages which the\r\nRoman plan has over our ordinary method of settling a new region are\r\napparent at once.\r\n\r\nA discussion of this feature of the policy which the Romans followed\r\nin a newly acquired territory naturally leads us to speak of their\r\nattitude toward native communities. Lord Cromer remarks that the Roman\r\nprovinces did not have self-government. It is true that Spain and Gaul\r\ndid not have their own legislatures and chief magistrates, but the real\r\nadministrative units with which Rome dealt in making her arrangements\r\nwere the city-states of Spain and Gaul, and they had a large measure\r\nof self-government conferred on them by their charters. In a province\r\nlike Spain one finds communities in all the different stages of\r\nadvancement from the position of a dependent village to a free city or\r\na Roman colony, and one may well ask if the Roman system was not a more\r\npractical one than ours. We treat Porto Rico, for instance, as a unit.\r\nAll the villages or cities in the island are put on the same legal\r\nbasis, no matter what the state of civilization of the different towns\r\nmay be. The Romans would have granted the full rights of citizenship to\r\none or two of them, and advanced the others from their more lowly state\r\nas they became more civilized and prosperous. In this way they held\r\nbefore native communities a prize which those communities were always\r\neager to attain, and from the first century of our era we find one town\r\nafter another advancing to a fuller enjoyment of civic rights. The\r\nsame policy was applied to individuals. Roman citizenship was often\r\ngranted to selected persons in a community. Such a grant identified the\r\ninterests of these provincial leaders with those of Rome, and enlisted\r\ntheir support for the Roman régime.\r\n\r\nThe agencies which the Empire used so successfully in Romanizing the\r\nprovinces, that is to say the establishment of law and order, the\r\nretention of local self-government, the liberal grants of citizenship\r\nto qualified individuals and cities, the development of a good civil\r\nservice, the building of roads, the construction of public works, the\r\nintroduction of the Latin language and of Roman law, and the unifying\r\ninfluence in the later period of the Church, engendered a feeling of\r\nsolidarity throughout the Western World, which was one of the most\r\nvaluable legacies handed down by the Romans to later times. Even\r\nClaudian, the last important Roman poet, writing after the crushing\r\ndefeat of Valens by the barbarians at Adrianople, saw clearly that, in\r\nspite of all the disasters which had overtaken Rome, the sense of unity\r\nstill persisted throughout the Western World. He writes in sorrow of\r\nthe goddess, Roma:\r\n\r\n  “H_er voice is weak, and slow her steps; her\r\n      eyes_\r\n  D_eep sunk within; her cheeks are gone;\r\n      her arms_\r\n  A_re shrivelled up with wasting leanness_,”\r\n\r\nbut at another moment he cries triumphantly: “We who drink of\r\nthe Rhone and the Orontes are all one nation.” The feeling which\r\nClaudian expresses persisted throughout the Middle Ages. The German\r\nstates in Italy recognized it by putting the portrait of the Eastern\r\nEmperor on their coins. As Poole remarks in his _Illustrations of\r\nthe History of Mediaeval Thought_: “The Empire of Charlemagne was\r\nno mere resuscitation of the extinct empire of the West. It was the\r\ncontinuation of that universal empire, whose seat Constantine had\r\nestablished at Byzantium, but whose existence there was now held to\r\nhave terminated by the succession of a woman, the empress Irene....\r\nThe empire, therefore, went back to its rightful seat, and its title\r\ndevolved on Charlemagne.” All the minor rulers also throughout the\r\ncivilized parts of Europe thought of their authority as coming to\r\nthem from the Roman Empire. This feeling of unity was kept up by\r\nthe use of the old Roman highways of commerce, by the employment of\r\nthe Latin language as the _lingua franca_ of Europe, by the Church,\r\nand by the continued use of Roman law. Roman law in particular was\r\na stabilizing influence for many centuries after the dissolution of\r\nthe Empire. In the East and in the portions of Italy controlled by\r\nJustinian’s successors the _Code_ of Justinian was in force. Roman law\r\nentered largely also into the _Breviary_ of Alaric, the laws of the\r\nBurgundians, the edict of Theodoric, and the French capitularies. The\r\nlaw of Justinian was taught in the schools of Rome and Ravenna without\r\nmuch interruption from the sixth to the eleventh century, and with the\r\nrevival of commerce which followed the Crusades, there was a vigorous\r\ndevelopment of Roman mercantile law. After the tenth century “the trend\r\nwas toward unity within certain areas and the political separation\r\nof these great areas from each other.” This drift toward nationalism\r\nreached its climax at the time of the Reformation. The spirit of a\r\nlarger unity, which earlier centuries had taken over from the Roman\r\nEmpire, disappeared in great measure, but the longing for it and the\r\nneed of it and the knowledge that it once existed and may be called to\r\nlife again, find expression today in the organization of the League\r\nof Nations. How disastrous has been its displacement by the present\r\nintense nationalistic spirit is recognized on all sides. It would\r\nalmost seem as if Philip Kerr, who had served as Confidential Secretary\r\nof Lloyd George at the Peace Conference in Paris, was thinking of\r\nthe irreparable loss which Europe has suffered in this respect, when\r\nhe said in his address at the Williamstown Conference in 1922: “What\r\nis the fundamental cause of war? I do not say the only cause of war,\r\nbut the most active and constant cause. It is not race or religion or\r\ncolor or nationality or despotism, or progress, or any of the causes\r\nusually cited. It is the division of humanity into separate states. The\r\nproposition which I am concerned to establish today is the division\r\nof humanity into separate states, each owing loyalty to itself, each\r\nrecognizing no law higher than its own will, each looking at every\r\nproblem from its own point of view, which is the fundamental cause\r\nof war.” Rome welded the particularism of the ancient Mediterranean\r\nworld into the unity of her Empire. Only by a similar recognition of\r\nthe solidarity of the interests of all civilized peoples can we hope to\r\nemerge from the conditions which threaten us today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. SOME POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS COMMON TO THE ROMANS AND TO\r\nMODERN PEOPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political and social problems which confronted Rome are those which\r\nAmerica, England, and France face today, and nothing brings out more\r\nclearly the close relation which our civilization bears to hers than\r\nthe identity of these ancient and modern problems. In no respect may we\r\nprofit more by a study of her history than in contemplating the means\r\nwhich Rome employed in solving them. Her successes may guide us, and\r\nher failures warn us. Some of the difficulties which beset her have\r\ncome to the surface in discussing certain topics in the two preceding\r\nchapters, and of the others we can speak briefly of only a few, and\r\nmainly by way of illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE COLOR AND THE LABOR QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nTwo of our most serious social and political questions do not come\r\nto the surface in Roman history, at least not in the form in which\r\nthey present themselves today. I mean the “color question” and the\r\nlabor question. Lord Cromer in the book to which reference has already\r\nbeen made ventures the opinion that “antipathy based on differences\r\nof colour is a plant of comparatively recent growth.” He connects\r\nits development with the fact that in modern times the white man has\r\nenslaved only the black man. Out of this relation the hostility of the\r\ntwo races has developed, and has extended its scope so as to determine\r\nin some measure the attitude of the white man toward the brown and\r\nyellow man. The Roman had both white and black slaves. All foreigners\r\nwere on the same plane below himself. Consequently he did not have that\r\ndifficulty in dealing with the dark races which some modern nations\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nIn the towns and villages of the Roman Empire we find inscriptions\r\nattesting the existence of nearly five hundred different\r\ntrade-guilds.[30] Industry was carried to a high degree of\r\nspecialization. We find organizations of carpenters, joiners,\r\ngold-smiths, silver-smiths, sandal-makers, bakers, skippers, actors,\r\ngladiators, and of men in almost every conceivable occupation. Yet\r\nwe have no record of an industrial strike in Roman history,[30a]\r\nnor of the intrusion of the labor question into politics. The Roman\r\ntrade-guilds do not seem to have tried to raise wages or to improve\r\nworking conditions, in spite of their great numbers and their large\r\nmembership. They were primarily benevolent and social societies. Most\r\nof the laborers worked in their own homes or in small shops, and not in\r\nlarge factories where common conditions develop class consciousness and\r\na sense of solidarity. Furthermore, the great majority of the manual\r\nlaborers were either slaves or freedmen, and joint action to improve\r\ntheir condition would have been well nigh impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. VOTING AND ELECTIONS\r\n\r\nPassing now to a discussion of some of the political and social\r\nproblems which the Romans and modern peoples _do_ have in common, we\r\nmay conveniently begin a comparative study of these questions by saying\r\na word about the way in which the Romans tried to suppress the evils\r\nconnected with canvassing for votes and conducting the elections. The\r\nsimplicity and strictness of the olden time is well illustrated by the\r\nearliest corrupt-practices acts, which forbade candidates for public\r\noffice to whiten their togas or to go about among the farmers on market\r\ndays. Next we hear of an edict to prevent two candidates from combining\r\nagainst a rival. Not until the second century B.C., when wealth from\r\nthe provinces began to pour into Rome, do we find laws against bribery\r\non the statute books. From this time on proof multiplies that fraud\r\nand force were used at the elections. Between 67 and 52 B.C. no less\r\nthan six bills were brought in to suppress political corruption. The\r\ntwo evils which were most prevalent were the formation of corrupt\r\npolitical clubs and the excessive expenditure of money by candidates.\r\nAspirants for office spent enormous sums in giving gladiatorial games\r\nand public banquets. We hear a great deal about political clubs in the\r\n_Candidate’s Handbook_ which Quintus Cicero addressed to his brother\r\nin 64 B.C., when Marcus was a candidate for the consulship. These\r\norganizations were formed by ambitious politicians for the purpose\r\nof controlling the elections by bribery or the use of force. They\r\nbroke up the political meetings held by candidates of the opposite\r\nparty, blocked up the entrances to the polling booths, gave out only\r\nballots of their own party, and openly canvassed for voters who could\r\nbe bribed. The Romans had even less success in combatting these evils\r\nby means of legislation than we have had. Not until the elections had\r\nbeen transferred from the people to the senate did they disappear.\r\nThe remedies which helped most in holding them in check were the\r\nintroduction of the secret ballot, the establishment of a special court\r\nto hear cases of bribery, with the power to inflict severe penalties,\r\nand the suppression of all political clubs. This last measure was very\r\nhelpful, but it was easier of adoption in Rome, where the right of\r\nassociation was limited, than it would be today. Cicero’s contemporary,\r\nCato, made the interesting proposal that all newly chosen magistrates\r\nshould be required to appear in court and prove that they had been\r\nelected by legitimate means, but this bill failed of passage.\r\n\r\nMoney was freely used by unscrupulous aspirants for office, but it is\r\nnot probable that capital played the important part in directing the\r\npolicy of the state which certain modern writers ascribe to it. The\r\nsuppression of piracy in the Eastern Mediterranean and the restoration\r\nof order in Asia Minor by Pompey were undoubtedly brought about by the\r\ninfluence of the bankers and tax-farmers, but two or three important\r\nconsiderations make it reasonably certain that “big business” did\r\nnot have the political power in Rome which it has with us today.[31]\r\nThe amount of money invested in public contracts was comparatively\r\nsmall. Even under the Republic only a small part of the revenue from\r\nthe provinces was collected by private Roman companies, and under\r\nthe Empire, as we have already noticed, the collection of taxes was\r\ntaken over more and more by the state. Finally, there do not seem to\r\nhave been many large financial corporations, and there is little, if\r\nany, evidence to show that they combined to bring pressure to bear\r\non the government. In fact, Roman business and trade were largely\r\nindividualistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE POLITICAL BOSS\r\n\r\nIn the last century B.C. political and social conditions were ideal\r\nfor the development of the political boss, and in many respects they\r\nresemble our own. In the first place, Rome, as is the case with many\r\nof our large cities today, was filled with foreigners. We shall have\r\noccasion later to discuss in greater detail the social and economic\r\neffect of the presence in Italy and Rome of this foreign population.\r\nFor our present purpose it is sufficient to note that Professor Frank\r\nin a recent number of the _American Historical Review_[32] has shown\r\nthat nearly 90 per cent. of the population permanently resident at Rome\r\nin the Empire were of foreign extraction. Most of these foreigners\r\nwere of course slaves, but many were freedmen who had the right to\r\nvote. They were ignorant of Roman political traditions. Many of them\r\nmade a precarious living, and their votes could probably be had for\r\nmoney or through the influence of their patrons. Of such men the\r\nguilds and political clubs of the late Republic were largely made up.\r\nTo them we must add the freemen who were driven out of the country\r\ndistricts by the decline of agriculture, or who drifted to the city\r\nbecause of the attractions which it could offer. These classes of\r\npeople naturally fell under the leadership of political bosses. It\r\nhappened too that several of the political bosses of this period had\r\nbeen or were still in command of large armies. Veterans who had served\r\nunder these commanders and had settled in Italy naturally accepted\r\nthe political leadership of their former officers. We are familiar in\r\nthis country with the great influence exerted at the end of several of\r\nour wars by compact organizations of ex-service men. Furthermore, in\r\nRome there were no permanent party organizations. Voters followed a\r\nleader, rather than a political principle. All these facts contributed\r\nto strengthen the hands of the boss, and the political history of\r\nthe last half century of the Republic centres about the activity of\r\nsuch men as Marius, Crassus, Caesar, Milo, and Clodius. Indeed the\r\nFirst Triumvirate, which controlled Rome for ten years, had no legal\r\nbasis. It rested upon a personal agreement between Caesar, Pompey, and\r\nCrassus for the division of the political spoils. In a certain degree\r\nAugustus continued this tradition, for his power rested largely upon\r\nthe fact that the candidates for office favored by him were certain\r\nto be elected and would do his bidding after the election, and thus\r\nthe measures supported by him were sure to be adopted. The Roman boss\r\ndiffered from most political bosses of today in his willingness to take\r\noffice and assume the responsibility which the holding of an office\r\nentails.\r\n\r\nThe political boss is of course abhorrent to an oligarchical system.\r\nIt is a fundamental principle of an aristocracy that no individual\r\nshould attain undue prominence above others of his class, and perhaps\r\nno governing body has devised so many safeguards against Caesarism,\r\nand entrenched itself so firmly behind tradition, as the Roman senate\r\ndid. Every aspirant for an important magistracy must have reached\r\na specified age and must have held all the lower offices. These\r\nprovisions prevented a successful politician from being carried into\r\nthe consulship on a sudden wave of popular favor, and a consul’s term\r\nof office was so short that he had little opportunity to make his\r\npolitical position secure. Over against him stood the senate with its\r\n_esprit de corps_, and its power to control appointments and to ratify\r\nor reject treaties, which, as we noticed in the last chapter, enabled\r\nit to determine in large measure his domestic and foreign policy. The\r\nRoman Senate protected itself for many decades against the political\r\naspirations of successful generals by granting them or withholding\r\nfrom them a sufficient army, by voting them generous or niggardly\r\nappropriations, by requiring them to submit all their acts to it for\r\nratification, and by conceding to them or refusing them a triumph or a\r\n“thanksgiving” on their return to Rome. Its power was only broken in\r\nthe last century of the Republic when certain democratic magistrates\r\nmade an appeal directly to the popular assembly. To this move on the\r\npart of the Executive we have had an analogue on several occasions\r\nwhen the Chief Executive of the United States or of a state has made\r\na popular appeal to the voters in his struggle with a legislative\r\nbody.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE RECALL\r\n\r\nOne of the political problems with which we have been much concerned\r\nin late years has to do with the possibility of removing an elected\r\nofficial from office. We proceed to the accomplishment of that purpose\r\nin two ways, by the traditional method of impeachment or by the new\r\ndevice of the recall. They differ in the fact that the former is a\r\njudicial procedure, whereas a recall is brought about by the direct\r\naction of the voters. The Romans were a practical people and did not\r\nlike to interfere with the orderly transaction of public business by\r\nremoving an executive from office. Consequently we have no record of\r\nany attempt being made to remove a civil magistrate from office until\r\nwe come to the stormy period of the second century before our era. In\r\n169 B.C. one of the censors of that year was impeached and tried before\r\nthe popular assembly, and in 133 B.C. the tribune Tiberius Gracchus\r\nsecured the recall of his colleague Octavius by a popular vote. Both\r\ncases illustrate the application of the Roman doctrine of popular\r\nsovereignty in its extreme form. Neither method of procedure, however,\r\nfound favor in later years. In fact the Romans did not have so much\r\nneed of either process as we have today, because the tribune could veto\r\nan arbitrary or unscrupulous act of a magistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PENSIONS, BONUSES, AND MILITARISM\r\n\r\nOne of the important political and economic questions which countries\r\nhave to settle in modern times at the close of a war is that of\r\nreinstating soldiers in civil pursuits and of granting them some\r\nmaterial compensation for their services. After the Civil War in this\r\ncountry the question was solved by throwing open lands in the Middle\r\nWest to settlement and by appropriating money liberally for pensions.\r\nAt the moment of writing the needs of the soldier returning to civil\r\nlife from the late war with the Central European powers have been\r\nmet in part by a system of insurance, by the payment of a small sum\r\non discharge, and by making provision for the disabled. It has been\r\nfurther proposed to compensate men honorably discharged from service\r\nby giving them either cash payments or homestead allotments. All of\r\nthese plans were tried by the Romans. Down to the close of the second\r\ncentury before our era only the well-to-do were enrolled in the\r\nlegions. Marius for the first time opened the ranks to the proletariat.\r\nWhen the term of service of his soldiers came to an end he had to\r\nmake suitable provision for them. He did so by founding a colony and\r\ngranting them allotments in it. This precedent was followed by Sulla,\r\nPompey, and Caesar, and between 59 and 31 B.C. twenty-five or thirty\r\ncolonies of veterans were thus established. Under the Empire a soldier\r\nreceived also a fixed sum of money on his discharge. The benefit\r\nsocieties which the Roman government encouraged among the soldiers\r\nserved somewhat the same purpose as our system of war-insurance. The\r\nbonus system was adopted, in a formal way, for the first time by\r\nAugustus in 7 B.C., instead of the customary assignments of land. At\r\nthat time he gave gratuities to his discharged soldiers amounting to\r\n400,000,000 sesterces, as he tells us in his biography.[34] Although\r\nthis is perhaps the earliest instance of the systematic award of a\r\nlarge cash payment, occasional grants of this sort occurred much\r\nearlier, because the bonus had its beginning in the division of the\r\nspoils of war among the soldiers, and was given at the time of the\r\ntriumph. When the practice of granting a bonus had once been formally\r\nestablished, the occasions on which it was given were multiplied\r\nfor political reasons. To win popularity with the army, Tiberius,\r\non his accession, made a grant of money to every soldier, and his\r\nexample was followed by Caligula, Claudius, Nero, and most of their\r\nsuccessors. In the later empire, when the support of the army became\r\nall-important to an emperor, bonuses increased in size; they were\r\ngiven on many anniversaries, and imposed a very heavy burden on the\r\nimperial treasury. In the fourth century the Emperor Julian, who was\r\nfar from warlike, on mounting the throne, gave to every Roman soldier\r\na bonus whose nominal value was equal to about thirty-two dollars.\r\nSince there were probably 400,000 soldiers in the army, this action\r\ncost the government $12,800,000 or nearly $50,000,000 if we roughly\r\nestimate that gold and silver would purchase four times as much then\r\nas they do now. The militaristic spirit of Rome has descended to us\r\nand makes its influence felt today. The campaigns and the conquests of\r\ngreat Roman commanders have been studied with minute care by generals\r\nand statesmen in modern times. Elaborate studies, for instance, have\r\nbeen made of Caesar’s campaigns by Napoleon III, by Col. Stoffel\r\nof his staff, and in General von Göler’s great work dedicated to\r\nMarshall von Moltke with the noteworthy phrase: “Feldherr und Sieger\r\nauf gallischem Boden.” Elsewhere, in a paper on the trend of classical\r\nhistory, I noted the fact that the study of Roman military history had\r\nbeen engaging the attention of an unusually large number of scholars\r\nin the years immediately preceding the war with the states of Central\r\nEurope. It was also a significant thing that many of these writers in\r\ntheir appraisal of the men and the events of ancient times tacitly held\r\nto the principle that in the ultimate analysis the course of history\r\nwas determined by the use of naked force, and that the progress of the\r\nworld was furthered by the conquest of the small nation by the great\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. CASES OF PATERNALISM\r\n\r\nIn one of the preceding chapters we have tried to show how the\r\nRomans in the second century before our era attempted to check the\r\ndecline of morals and the growth of extravagance by giving the censor\r\nextraordinary discretionary power over the daily life of the citizens.\r\nIt may be interesting in this connection to say a word of three or\r\nfour other cases of paternalism, in which the state interfered in\r\nprivate life or business in the hope of correcting some widespread\r\nevil or social disorder. All of these social evils which Rome tried\r\nto remedy have their analogues in our own times. The most outstanding\r\nof these problems was unemployment and lack of food in the large\r\ncities. This was the problem which Gaius Gracchus tried to solve by\r\nhis corn law in 123 B.C. Our best estimates put the population of\r\nRome at 800,000 in the early Empire.[35] Perhaps it numbered a half\r\nmillion in the time of the Gracchi. Italy, after supplying her own\r\nneeds, was unable to provide all these people with sufficient food, or\r\nwith food at prices within the reach of the poor. In times of great\r\nscarcity previous governments had tried to meet the difficulty by\r\nbringing grain to Rome from Sicily and Sardinia. The motives which\r\nactuated them were not primarily humanitarian. But a hungry proletariat\r\nwould have threatened the existence of society and government. Gaius\r\nGracchus tried to do in a systematic way what some of his predecessors\r\nhad attempted in an irregular fashion. He organized the purchase and\r\ntransportation of grain from the provinces and provided for its sale\r\nat about half the market price. He may have thought of this measure\r\nas a temporary palliative to meet an emergency. He may have hoped\r\nlater to do away with unemployment, by developing the industries of\r\nRome and settling the needy in colonies. He may have expected to\r\nstimulate agriculture in Italy and in that way to bring down the price\r\nof food. But the immediate result was the recognition by the state of\r\nits duty to provide food for the city, and to adjust the price of the\r\nnecessities of life to the purse of the consumer. Within seventy-five\r\nyears after the tribunate of Gracchus we hear of four or five new\r\ncorn laws, each one increasing the amount of grain supplied by the\r\ngovernment or lowering its price. The democratic leader, Clodius, in\r\n58 B.C. even supplied grain free to the needy. Suetonius tells us\r\nthat Caesar introduced a partial reform by cutting down the number of\r\npeople who received cheap or free grain from 320,000 to 150,000. This\r\nessay in the fixing of prices by the government which Gracchus made\r\nin 123 B.C. was carried to its logical conclusion by Diocletian in\r\nhis famous edict in 301 A.D. In another place the present writer has\r\nmade a study of this decree, which was found in Asia Minor some two\r\ncenturies ago engraved on tablets.[36] It is sufficient to note here\r\nthat in this document the Emperor fixed the maximum prices which it was\r\nlawful to charge for seven hundred or eight hundred different articles\r\ncomprising food, clothing, shoes, and labor of all kinds. The penalty\r\nfor selling an article at a higher price than that specified in the law\r\nwas death. The attempt to enforce the law led to riot and disorder and\r\nits ultimate repeal.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in his edict Diocletian tried to fix wages,\r\nnot minimum, but maximum wages. The later empire was much concerned\r\nwith the labor-question. It believed that the prosperity of the people\r\nrequired a proper diversification of industry, that each community\r\nshould have a sufficient number of carpenters, weavers, and farmers,\r\nfor instance. This end could be attained most easily by making an\r\noccupation hereditary in a family. When this point had been reached\r\nthe caste system was fixed on Roman society. This final result may\r\nbe seen in the _Theodosian Code_ of the fifth century, but we cannot\r\nfollow all the steps by which it was reached. Apparently the state\r\naccomplished its purpose by means of the trade-guilds. Hundreds of\r\ninscriptions testify to the existence of these organizations in various\r\nparts of the Empire. Just as the central government made the _curia_,\r\nor local senate, responsible for the taxes of the municipality which\r\nit represented, so it held the guilds of carpenters or of weavers\r\nresponsible for the services which they were qualified to render to\r\nthe community. This obligation was first laid on the guilds of the\r\nskippers and bakers. If they allowed their trades to languish, Rome,\r\nAlexandria, and Constantinople would starve. Their occupations were the\r\n“basic industries” of antiquity. The man who was a baker or a seaman\r\nwas therefore obliged to continue as a baker or seaman his life long,\r\nand his children were obliged to follow his footsteps. Gradually other\r\ntrades were swept into the government’s net, until freedom in industry\r\nand commerce had disappeared.\r\n\r\nEven before the state had brought the laborer under its control, it\r\nhad acquired the ownership of a great part of the natural resources of\r\nthe Empire. The Emperor owned gold mines in Dalmatia and Dacia, silver\r\nmines in Pannonia, iron mines in Noricum, tin mines in Britain, and\r\nmarble quarries, forests, clay-pits, and salt-works in other provinces.\r\nEgypt was from the outset the personal domain of the Emperor, and by\r\nconfiscation or legacy he gradually acquired immense estates in most\r\nof the richer provinces. Most of the mines and the imperial estates\r\nwere in charge of a procurator, and were let out at a fixed rental to\r\ncontractors. The work on the estates was done by tenants. Whether state\r\nownership promoted productivity or not we can not say with certainty,\r\nbut the complaints which we find in the _Theodosian Code_[37] of the\r\nexorbitant prices charged for the products of the mines and quarries\r\nwould seem to show that they were inefficiently managed under the later\r\nempire. The outcome, so far as the workers in the mines and the tenants\r\non the estates are concerned, is clear enough. Titles are found in the\r\n_Theodosian Code_,[38] requiring those who live near the mines and\r\ntheir children to work in the mines. The condition of the tenants on\r\nimperial estates had fallen to a low point as early as the latter part\r\nof the second century, as we can see from the pathetic petition which\r\nthe people on an imperial estate in Africa addressed to Commodus. In\r\ntime the tenants on these estates found it impossible to give up their\r\nleases, or were forbidden to do so, and became serfs.\r\n\r\nIn this field of paternalism of which we have been speaking another\r\nimportant issue of modern times has its counterpart in the history\r\nof Roman politics. I mean the attitude of the central government\r\ntoward the municipalities within its territory. Within recent years\r\nthis question has taken an acute form in the states of New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and Illinois. To what extent may the legislature or the\r\ngovernor interfere to correct local evils in the city of New York, in\r\nPittsburgh, or in Chicago? The Romans under the Republic were not much\r\nconcerned with the welfare of the cities under their control. With the\r\nestablishment of the Empire a change in their attitude is noticeable.\r\nThe improvement in the general administration of the provinces\r\nnaturally brought into relief certain evils in the local governments\r\nof provincial cities, especially financial mismanagement. The letters\r\nwhich Pliny, the governor of Bithynia, wrote to Trajan in the early\r\npart of the second century are very illuminating in this respect.\r\nHe asks his imperial master what shall be done at Nicaea, where\r\n10,000,000 sesterces have been spent on an unfinished theatre whose\r\nwalls have already begun to crack.[39] May he inspect the accounts of\r\nthe city of Apamea? Is it proper for him to check the extravagance\r\nshown at civic festivals? Out of these comparatively small beginnings\r\nthere developed the imperial policy of supervising the finances of the\r\nmunicipalities of the Empire, and curators were sent out to them, who\r\ntook entire charge of all the land and other property belonging to a\r\ncity, and were responsible not to the citizens of the town, but to the\r\ngovernor of the province. The exercise by the curator of these large\r\npowers encroached on the authority of the local officials, lessened\r\nthe feeling of civic responsibility among the people, and in the end\r\ncompletely undermined local self-government. If we make a possible\r\nexception of the censorship of morals in the second century before\r\nour era, all the experiments in paternalism which the Romans made\r\nfailed:--the fixing of prices, the control of the labor market, state\r\nownership, and the supervision of local government.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. GROWTH OF CITIES\r\n\r\nThe drifting of large numbers of people into the great cities was one\r\nof the baffling problems of antiquity, as it is today. It meant the\r\nwithdrawal of farmers and farm-laborers needed on the land. It led to\r\nunemployment in the cities. It brought so many people into the cities\r\nthat it was difficult to supply them with sufficient food. It made the\r\ncities in times of economic distress or political excitement dangerous\r\ncentres of disorder. To discuss here all the reasons why Rome and\r\ncertain other cities grew to their unwieldy size would take us too far\r\nafield. We may mention, however, one or two of the influences at work.\r\nMany of the native farm laborers had been killed in the long wars. Many\r\nof the farmers had suffered the same fate, and their farms had passed\r\ninto the hands of large landowners and were cultivated by slaves. The\r\nremaining peasant proprietors could not compete with the ranch owners,\r\nand the free laborers could not hold their own against the slaves.\r\nPeople from both these classes went into the provinces or moved to\r\nthe city in the early period, while under the late republic and the\r\nempire the size of the city was augmented by a great influx of slaves,\r\nwho found it a comparatively easy matter to purchase their freedom or\r\nto obtain it in the wills of their masters. To feed these people and\r\nkeep them reasonably contented the government gave them food free or at\r\na low price and provided them with baths, theatres, and gladiatorial\r\ncontests. This attempt to relieve the situation only aggravated the\r\nevil. The attractions which the government added to city life by its\r\naction kept former residents in Rome and drew others to the city.\r\n\r\nClosely related to this question of the alarming growth of the larger\r\ncities was the displacement of the native stock in Rome and Italy by\r\npeople from abroad. We have already noticed that nearly ninety per\r\ncent. of the permanent residents of Rome under the Empire were of\r\nforeign extraction. Rome was therefore facing the same situation which\r\ndisturbs us. It is true that most of the foreigners living in Italy\r\nwere slaves or the descendants of slaves, as is the case with the\r\nnegroes in this country. It was an instance of forced rather than of\r\nvoluntary immigration, but the resultant change in the character of\r\nthe population is the same in both cases. Not only was the city of Rome\r\ndominated by foreigners, but at Beneventum, and Milan, and throughout\r\nthe country districts of Italy the same condition prevailed. In still\r\nanother respect the change in the character of the population of Italy\r\nreminds us of a corresponding change in our own population. Fifty years\r\nago most of our immigrants came from western Europe. That tide of\r\nimmigration has decreased and we regard with some alarm the arrival at\r\nour ports now of large numbers of people from eastern and southeastern\r\nEurope. They come from countries whose languages, and political and\r\nsocial ideas are very different from ours. They do not readily accept\r\nour traditions and institutions. This was exactly the situation in\r\nItaly under the Empire. By very interesting studies which Professor\r\nFrank[40] and others have made of the names found on tombstones and\r\nin the records of trade-guilds it appears that “the whole of Italy\r\nas well as the Romanized portions of Gaul and Spain were during the\r\nEmpire dominated in blood by the East.” The result was disastrous to\r\nRoman traditions and to Roman political life. In Professor Frank’s\r\nopinion, the fact that, even as early as the time of the Gracchi,\r\n“reform through orderly compromise gave way to revolution through\r\nbloodshed is largely due to the displacement of real Italic peoples by\r\nmen of Oriental, Punic and Iberian stock.” At all events the presence\r\nof this large Oriental element in the population of the West helps us\r\nto understand the comparative willingness with which Rome accepted the\r\nprincipate in place of the republic. It helps us to understand the\r\ndevelopment of autocracy, the gradual adoption of Oriental titles and\r\nceremonial at court, and the partial acceptance by the people of the\r\nOriental theory of the Emperor’s power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SOME FINAL REFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n“The history of all institutions has a deep value and an abiding\r\ninterest to all those who have the courage to work upon it. It\r\npresents in every branch a regularly developed series of causes and\r\nconsequences, and abounds in examples of that continuity of life, the\r\nrealization of which is necessary to give the reader a personal hold\r\non the past and a right judgment of the present. For the roots of the\r\npresent lie deep in the past; and nothing in the past is dead to the\r\nman who would learn how the present comes to be what it is.” So Stubbs\r\nwrote on finishing his history of the _English Constitution_ and on\r\nsending it out to the public. What he has said when thinking of the\r\nbeginnings of constitutional government in England is true in a higher\r\ndegree of the relations of modern political institutions to those of\r\nRome. This is the case partly because we owe to Rome so much of our\r\npolitical philosophy and so much of our political system. It is true\r\npartly because our indebtedness to Rome in the field of politics has\r\nnot been appreciated, and consequently we have failed to understand\r\nthe origin and nature of many of our institutions. The failure to\r\nrecognize the great debt which we owe to her was a natural oversight.\r\nThe great gulf of the Middle Ages lies between Roman times and our\r\nown day. Until the trend of political thought and the development of\r\nsociety during that period came to be better understood, the close\r\nrelation which medieval political theory and practice bore to that of\r\nthe Romans and our dependence on the medieval were not seen. Until\r\nvery recently students of modern political institutions rarely carried\r\ntheir investigations beyond the limits of their respective countries,\r\nor at the most they did not go back beyond the Renaissance. But as the\r\nCarlyles have said in their _History of Mediaeval Political Theory_:\r\n“From the lawyers of the second century to the theorists of the French\r\nRevolution, the history of political thought is continuous, changing\r\nin form, modified in content, but still the same in its fundamental\r\nconceptions.” Many writers on political science in ignorance or\r\nin disregard of this continuity tell us, for instance, that the\r\nrepresentative principle was unknown in antiquity, or that the jury\r\nsystem was of English or Scandinavian origin. But fortunately a\r\nfew scholars, like Bryce, who have an acquaintance with classical\r\ninstitutions, are gradually correcting these errors and helping us\r\nto see the way in which many of our modern political theories and\r\ninstitutions have come to us from Rome.\r\n\r\nOur political indebtedness to the Romans takes two different forms. We\r\nhave inherited many theories and institutions from them, and in the\r\nsecond place we have before us for our guidance their experience in\r\ndealing with difficult practical problems. As we have noticed in the\r\npreceding chapters, they have taught us to study actual governmental\r\nsystems rather than to attempt the construction of Utopias. We owe\r\nto them the fruitful suggestion that the state may be compared to an\r\norganism. The conception of the brotherhood of man goes back to the\r\nearly Empire, and out of this conception international law, and its\r\ncounterpart, civil law, have developed. Roman writers recognized the\r\nthree forms of government, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and\r\npointed out the importance of dividing the functions of government\r\nbetween the legislative, executive and judicial branches. From them\r\nwe have derived our accepted doctrine of popular sovereignty, and to\r\nthem the theory of the divine right of kings may be traced. The Romans\r\ndeveloped the distinction which is so vital in English common law\r\nbetween statutes and customs, officially recognized, and showed the\r\ngreat advantages inherent in a flexible constitution which is made up\r\nof these two elements. They have handed down to us the representative\r\nprinciple, the jury method of trial, civil law, a clear conception of\r\nthe rights of a citizen, a jealous regard for law and tradition, a\r\ncomprehensive system of political checks and balances, model systems\r\nof local government and civil service, and methods of governing,\r\ncivilizing, and unifying alien peoples which have never been equalled.\r\n\r\nIt was this final contribution that Rome made to civilization of which\r\nMommsen was thinking, toward the end of his long study of Roman history\r\nand institutions, when he wrote: “If an angel of the Lord were to\r\nstrike the balance whether the domain ruled by Severus Antoninus was\r\ngoverned with the greater intelligence and the greater humanity at\r\nthat time or in the present day, whether civilization and national\r\nprosperity generally have since that time advanced or retrograded, it\r\nis very doubtful whether the decision would prove to be in favor of the\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The arrangements which Rome made with the several cities of Sicily\r\nare outlined by Cicero in his oration _In Verrem_, III. 12-14.\r\n\r\n[2] The traditional story of the Decemvirate and its codification of\r\nthe _Laws of the Twelve Tables_ is told graphically by Livy, III.\r\n32-54.
