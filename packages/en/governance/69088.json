In the eighteen-eighties, when Socialism\r\nrevived in England for the first time since the suppression of the\r\nParis Commune in 1871, it was not at first realized that what had\r\nreally been suppressed for good and all was the romantic revolutionary\r\nLiberalism and Radicalism of 1848, to which the Socialists had attached\r\nthemselves as a matter of course, partly because they were themselves\r\nromantic and revolutionary, and partly because both Liberals and\r\nSocialists had a common object in Democracy.\r\n\r\nBesides this common object the two had a common conception of\r\nmethod in revolution. They were both catastrophists. Liberalism had\r\nconquered autocracy and bureaucracy by that method in England and\r\nFrance, and then left industry to make what it could of the new\r\npolitical conditions by the unregulated action of competition between\r\nindividuals. Briefly, the Liberal plan was to cut off the King’s head,\r\nand leave the rest to Nature, which was supposed to gravitate towards\r\neconomic harmonies when not restrained by tyrannical governments. The\r\nSocialists were very far ahead of the Liberals in their appreciation\r\nof the preponderant importance of industry, even going so far as to\r\nmaintain, with Buckle and Marx, that all social institutions whatever\r\nwere imposed by economic conditions, and that there was fundamentally\r\nonly one tyranny: the tyranny of Capital. Yet even the Socialists\r\nhad so far formed their political habits in the Liberal school that\r\nthey were quite disposed to believe that if you cut off the head of\r\nKing Capital, you might expect to see things come right more or less\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this general statement shews the Revolutionaries of 1848-71\r\nas simpler than they appear on their own records. Proudhon was full of\r\nproposals: one of them, the minimum wage, turns out to be of the very\r\nfirst importance now that Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb have put the case\r\nfor it on an invincible basis of industrial fact and economic theory.\r\nLassalle really knew something of the nature of law, the practice\r\nof Government, and the mind of the governing classes. Marx, though\r\ncertainly a bit of a Liberal fatalist (did he not say that force is\r\nthe midwife of progress without reminding us that force is equally\r\nthe midwife of chaos, and chaos the midwife of martial law?), was at\r\nall events no believer in _Laisser-faire_. Socialism involves the\r\nintroduction of design, contrivance, and co-ordination, by a nation\r\nconsciously seeking its own collective welfare, into the present\r\nindustrial scramble for private gain; and as it is clear that this\r\ncannot be a spontaneous result of a violent overthrow of the existing\r\norder, and as the Socialists of 1848-71 were not blind, it would be\r\nimpossible to substantiate a claim for Fabian Essays as the first\r\ntext-book of Socialism in which catastrophism is repudiated as a method\r\nof Socialism.\r\n\r\nTherefore we must not say that the Revolutionists and Internationalists\r\nof 1848-71 believed in a dramatic overthrow of the capitalist system\r\nin a single convulsion, followed by the establishment of a new heaven,\r\na new earth, and a new humanity. They were visionaries, no doubt:\r\nall political idealists are; but they were quite as practical as the\r\nConservatives and Liberals who now believe that the triumph of their\r\nparty will secure the happiness and peace of the country. All the\r\nsame, it was almost impossible to induce them to speak or think of the\r\nSocialist state of the future in terms of the existing human material\r\nfor it. They talked of Communes, and, more vaguely and less willingly,\r\nof central departments to co-ordinate the activities of the Communes;\r\nbut if you ventured to point out that these apparently strange and\r\nromantic inventions were simply city corporations under the Local\r\nGovernment Board, they vehemently repudiated such a construction,\r\nand accused you of reading the conditions of the present system into\r\nSocialism. They had all the old Liberal mistrust of governments and\r\nbureaucracy and all the old tendency of bourgeois revolutionists\r\nto idolize the working class. They had no suspicion of the extent\r\nto which the very existence of society depends on the skilled work\r\nof administrators and experts, or how much wisdom and strength of\r\ncharacter is required for their control by popular representatives.\r\nThey actually believed that when their efforts throughout Europe had\r\ndemonstrated the economics of Socialism to the proletariats of the\r\ngreat capitals, the cry “Proletarians of all lands: unite,” would be\r\nresponded to; and that Capitalism would fall before an International\r\nFederation of the working classes of Europe, not in the sense in\r\nwhich some future historian will summarize two or three centuries\r\n(in which sense they may prove right enough), but as an immediate\r\npractical plan of action likely to be carried through in twenty years\r\nby Socialist societies holding completely and disdainfully aloof from\r\nordinary politics. In short, they were romantic amateurs, and, as\r\nsuch, were enormously encouraged and flattered when Marx and Engels\r\ninsisted on the “scientific” character of their movement in contrast\r\nto the “Utopian” Socialism of Owen, Fourier, St. Simon, and the men\r\nof the 1820-48 phase. When the events of 1871 in Paris tested them\r\npractically, their hopeless public incapacity forced their opponents to\r\nexterminate them in the most appalling massacre of modern times--all\r\nthe more ghastly because it was a massacre of the innocents.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in Europe was reconciled to the massacre by the usual\r\nprocess of slandering the victims. Now had Europe been politically\r\neducated no slanders would have been necessary; for even had it been\r\nhumanly possible that all the Federals mown down with mitrailleuses\r\nin Paris were incendiaries and assassins, it would still have been\r\nquestionable whether indiscriminate massacre is the right way to deal\r\nwith incendiaries and assassins. But there can be no question as to\r\nwhat must be done with totally incompetent governors. The one thing\r\nthat is politically certain nowadays is that if a body of men upset the\r\nexisting government of a modern state without sufficient knowledge and\r\ncapacity to continue the necessary and honest part of its work, and\r\nif, being unable to do that work themselves, they will not let anyone\r\nelse do it either, their extermination becomes a matter of immediate\r\nnecessity. It will avail them nothing that they aim higher than their\r\nfathers did; that their intentions are good, their action personally\r\ndisinterested, and their opponents selfish and venal routineers who\r\nwould themselves be equally at a loss if they had to create a new\r\norder instead of merely pulling the wires of an old one. Anyone who\r\nlooks at the portraits of the members of the Paris Commune can see at\r\na glance that they compared very favorably in all the external signs\r\nof amiability and refinement with any governing body then or now in\r\npower in Europe. But they could not manage the business they took upon\r\nthemselves; and Thiers could. Marx’s demonstration that they were\r\nheroes and martyrs and that Thiers and his allies were rascals did\r\nnot help in the least, though it was undeniably the ablest document\r\nin the conflict of moral clap-trap that obscured the real issues--so\r\nable indeed as a piece of literature, that more than thirty years after\r\nits publication it struck down the Marquis de Gallifet as if it had\r\nappeared in the _Temps_ or _Débats_ of the day before. It was amiable\r\nof the Federals to be so much less capable of exterminating Thiers than\r\nhe was of exterminating them; but sentimental amiability is not by\r\nitself a qualification for administering great modern States.\r\n\r\nNow the Fabian Society, born in 1884, and reaching the age of\r\ndiscretion in less than two years, had no mind to be exterminated.\r\nMartyrdom was described by one of us as “the only way in which a man\r\ncan become famous without ability.” Further, we had no illusions as\r\nto the treatment we should receive if, like the Paris Federals, we\r\nterrified the property classes before they were disabled by a long\r\nseries of minor engagements. In Paris in 1871, ordinary sane people\r\nhid themselves in their houses for weeks under the impression that\r\nthe streets were not safe: they did not venture out until they ran a\r\nserious risk of being shot at sight by their own partisans in the orgy\r\nof murder and cruelty that followed the discovery that the Commune\r\ncould fight only as a rat fights in a corner. Human nature has not\r\nchanged since then. In 1906 a Fabian essayist stood one May morning\r\nin the Rue de Rivoli, and found himself almost the only soul in the\r\nwest end of Paris who dared appear there. The cultured inhabitants of\r\nthat select quarter were hiding in their houses as before, with their\r\nlarders full of hams and their baths full of live fish to provision\r\nthem for a siege. There was much less danger of a revolution that\r\nday than there is of Primrose Hill becoming an active volcano at six\r\no’clock this evening; and the purpose of the Government and its party\r\nnewspapers in manufacturing the scare to frighten the bourgeoisie\r\ninto supporting them at the general election just then beginning was\r\nobvious, one would have thought, to the dimmest political perspicacity.\r\nIn the evening that same essayist, in the Place de la Révolution, saw\r\na crowd of sightseers assembled to witness the promised insurrection,\r\nand the troops and the police assembled to save society from it. It\r\nwas very like Trafalgar Square in 1887, when the same violent farce\r\nwas enacted in London. Occasionally the troops rode down some of the\r\nsightseers and the police arrested some of them. Enough persons lost\r\ntheir temper to make a few feeble attempts at riot, and to supply\r\narrests for the morning papers. Next day Society, saved, came out of\r\nits hiding places; sold the fish from its baths and the hams from\r\nits larders at a sacrifice (the weather being very hot and the hams\r\nin questionable condition); and voted gratefully for the government\r\nthat had frightened it out of its senses with an imaginary revolution\r\nand a ridiculous “complot.” England laughed at the Parisians (though\r\nplenty of English visitors had left Paris to avoid the threatened Reign\r\nof Terror); yet in the very next month our own propertied classes\r\nin Cairo, terrified by the Nationalist movement in Egypt, fell into\r\na paroxysm of cowardice and cruelty, and committed the Denshawai\r\natrocity, compared to which the massacre of Glencoe was a trifle. The\r\ncredulity which allows itself to be persuaded by reiteration of the\r\npious word Progress that we live in a gentler age than our fathers,\r\nand that the worst extremities of terror and vengeance are less to be\r\napprehended from our newly enriched automobilist classes than they\r\nwere from the aristocracies of the older orders, is not a Fabian\r\ncharacteristic. The Fabian knows that property does not hesitate to\r\nshoot, and that now, as always, the unsuccessful revolutionist may\r\nexpect calumny, perjury, cruelty, judicial and military massacre\r\nwithout mercy. And the Fabian does not intend to get thus handled if he\r\ncan help it. If there is to be any shooting, he intends to be at the\r\nState end of the gun. And he knows that it will take him a good many\r\nyears to get there. Still, he thinks he sees his way--or rather the\r\nrest of his way; for he is already well on the road.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1885 that the Fabian Society, amid the jeers of the\r\ncatastrophists, turned its back on the barricades and made up its\r\nmind to turn heroic defeat into prosaic success. We set ourselves two\r\ndefinite tasks: first, to provide a parliamentary program for a Prime\r\nMinister converted to Socialism as Peel was converted to Free Trade;\r\nand second, to make it as easy and matter-of-course for the ordinary\r\nrespectable Englishman to be a Socialist as to be a Liberal or a\r\nConservative.\r\n\r\nThese tasks we have accomplished, to the great disgust of our more\r\nromantic comrades. Nobody now conceives Socialism as a destructive\r\ninsurrection ending, if successful, in millennial absurdities.\r\nMembership of the Fabian Society, though it involves an express\r\navowal of Socialism, excites no more comment than membership of the\r\nSociety of Friends, or even of the Church of England. Incidentally,\r\nLabor has been organized as a separate political interest in the\r\nHouse of Commons, with the result that in the very next Budget it was\r\nconfessed for the first time that there are unearned as well as earned\r\nincomes in the country; an admission which, if not a surrender of the\r\nCapitalist citadel to Socialism, is at all events letting down the\r\ndrawbridge; for Socialism, on its aggressive side, is, and always has\r\nbeen, an attack on idleness. The resolution to make an end of private\r\nproperty is gathering force every day: people are beginning to learn\r\nthe difference between a man’s property in his walking stick, which\r\nis strictly limited by the public condition that he shall not use it\r\nto break his neighbor’s head or extort money with menaces, and those\r\nprivate rights of property which enable the idle to levy an enormous\r\ntribute, amounting at present to no less than £630,000,000 a year, on\r\nthe earnings of the rest of the community. The old attempt to confuse\r\nthe issue by asserting that the existence of the family, religion,\r\nmarriage, etc., etc., are inextricably bound up with the toleration\r\nof senseless social theft no longer imposes on anyone: after a whole\r\nyear of unexampled exploitation of this particular variety of obscene\r\nvituperation by the most widely read cheap newspapers in London, no\r\nSocialist is a penny the worse for it.\r\n\r\nThe only really effective weapon of the press against Socialism is\r\nsilence. Even Bishops cannot get reported when they advocate Socialism\r\nand tear to pieces the old pretence that political economy, science,\r\nand religion are in favor of our existing industrial system. Socialist\r\nspeakers now find audiences so readily that, even with comparatively\r\nhigh charges for admission, large halls can be filled to hear them\r\nwithout resorting to the usual channels of advertisement. Their\r\nspeeches are crammed with facts and figures and irresistible appeals to\r\nthe daily experience and money troubles of the unfortunate ratepayers\r\nand rent-payers who are too harassed by money worries to care about\r\nofficial party politics; but not a word of these is allowed to leak\r\nthrough to the public through the ordinary channels of newspaper\r\nreporting. However, the conspiracy of silence has its uses to us. We\r\nhave converted the people who have actually heard us. The others,\r\nhaving no news of our operations, have left us unmolested until our\r\nmovement has secured its grip of the public. Now that the alarm has\r\nat last been given, nobody, it seems, is left in the camp of our\r\nenemies except the ignorant, the politically imbecile, the corruptly\r\ninterested, and the retinue of broken, drunken, reckless mercenaries\r\nwho are always ready to undertake a campaign of slander against the\r\nopponents of any vested interest which has a bountiful secret service\r\nfund. This may seem a strong thing to say; but it is impossible not to\r\nbe struck by the feebleness and baseness of the opposition to Socialism\r\nto-day as compared with the opposition of twenty years ago. In the days\r\nwhen Herbert Spencer’s brightest pupils, from Mrs. Sidney Webb to Grant\r\nAllen, turned from him to the Socialism in which he could see nothing\r\nbut “the coming slavery,” we could respect him whilst confuting him.\r\nTo-day we neither respect our opponents nor confute them. We simply,\r\nlike Mrs. Stetson Gillman’s prejudice slayer, “walk through them as if\r\nthey were not there.”\r\n\r\nStill, we do not affect to underrate the huge public danger of a press\r\nwhich is necessarily in the hands of the very people whose idleness and\r\nextravagance keep the nation poor and miserable in spite of its immense\r\nresources. It costs quarter of a million to start a London daily paper\r\nwith any chance of success; and every man who writes for it risks\r\nhis livelihood every time he pens a word that threatens the incomes\r\nof the proprietors and their class. The quantity of snobbish and\r\nanti-social public opinion thus manufactured is formidable; and a new\r\nsort of crime--the incitement by newspapers of mobs to outrage and even\r\nmurder--hitherto tried only on religious impostors, is beginning to be\r\napplied to politics. The result is likely to be another illustration\r\nof the impossibility of combining individual freedom with economic\r\nslavery. We have had to throw freedom of contract to the winds to save\r\nthe working classes from extermination as a result of “free” contracts\r\nbetween penniless fathers of starving families and rich employers.\r\nFreedom of the press is hardly less illusory when the press belongs to\r\nthe slave owners of the nation, and not a single journalist is really\r\nfree. We think it well therefore at this moment to warn our readers not\r\nto measure the extent of our operations or our influence, much less\r\nthe strength of our case, by what they read of us in the papers. The\r\ntaste for spending one’s life in drudgery and never-ending pecuniary\r\nanxiety solely in order that certain idle and possibly vicious people\r\nmay fleece you for their own amusement, is not so widespread as the\r\npapers would have us think. Even that timidest of Conservatives, the\r\nmiddle class man with less than £500 a year (sometimes less than £100)\r\nis beginning to ask himself why his son should go, half-educated, to\r\na clerk’s desk at fifteen, to enable another man’s son to go to a\r\nuniversity and complete an education of which, as a hereditary idler,\r\nhe does not intend to make use. To tell him that such self-questioning\r\nis a grave symptom of Free Love and Atheism may terrify him; but it\r\ndoes not convince. And the evolution of Socialism from the Red spectre\r\non the barricade, with community of wives (all petroleuses), and\r\nCompulsory Atheism, to the Fabian Society and the Christian Social\r\nUnion, constitutional, respectable, even official, eminent, and titled,\r\nis every day allaying his dread of it and increasing his scepticism as\r\nto the inevitability of the ever more and more dreaded knock of the\r\nground landlord’s agent and the rate collector.\r\n\r\nNow, as everyone knows, the course of evolution, in Socialism or\r\nanything else, does not involve the transformation of the earlier\r\nforms into the later. The earlier forms persist side by side with the\r\nlater until they are either deliberately exterminated by them or put\r\nout of countenance so completely that they lose the heart to get born.\r\nThis is what has happened in the evolution of Fabian Socialism. Fabian\r\nSocialism has not exterminated the earlier types; and though it has\r\nput them so much out of countenance that they no longer breed freely,\r\nstill there they are still, preaching, collecting subscriptions, and\r\nrepulsing from Socialism many worthy citizens who are quite prepared\r\nto go as far, and farther, than the Fabian Society. Occasionally they\r\nmanage even to contest a Parliamentary seat in the name of Socialism,\r\nand to reassure the Capitalist parties by coming out at the foot of\r\nthe poll with fewer votes than one would have thought possible for\r\nany human candidate, were he even a flat-earth-man, in these days\r\nwhen everyone can find a following of some sort. More often, however,\r\nthey settle down into politically negligible sects, with a place of\r\nweekly meeting in which they preach to one another every week, except\r\nin the summer months, when they carry the red flag into the open air\r\nand denounce society as it passes or loiters to listen. Now far be\r\nit from us to repudiate these comrades. If a man has been brought\r\nto conviction of sin by the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion, and\r\nsubsequently enters the Church and becomes an Archbishop, he will\r\nalways have sufficient tenderness for the Connexion to refrain from\r\nattacking it, and to remember that many of its members are better\r\nChristians and better men than the more worldly-wise pillars of the\r\nChurch. The principal leaders of the Fabian movement are in the same\r\nposition with regard to many little societies locally known as “the\r\nSocialists.” We know that their worship of Marx (of whose works\r\nthey are for the most part ignorant, and of whose views they are\r\nintellectually incapable) and their repetition of shibboleths about\r\nthe Class War and the socialization of all the means of production,\r\ndistribution, and exchange have no more application to practical\r\npolitics than the Calvinistic covenants which so worried Cromwell when\r\nhe, too, tried to reconcile his sectarian creed with the practical\r\nexigencies of government and administration. We know also, and are\r\ncompelled on occasion to say bluntly out, that these little sects are\r\nignorant and incapable in public affairs; that in many cases their\r\nassumption of an extreme position is an excuse for doing nothing under\r\ncover of demanding the impossible; and that their inability to initiate\r\nany practical action when they do by chance get represented on public\r\nbodies often leads to their simply voting steadily for our opponents by\r\nway of protest against what they consider the compromising opportunism\r\nof the Fabians. There are moments when they become so intolerable a\r\nnuisance to the main body of the movement that we are sorely tempted to\r\nexcommunicate them formally, and warn the public that they represent\r\nnobody but their silly selves. But such a declaration, though it would\r\nbe perfectly true as far as political and administrative action is\r\nconcerned, would be misleading on the whole. In England, everyone\r\nbegins by being absurdly ignorant of public life and inept at public\r\naction. Just as the Conservative and Liberal Parties are recruited\r\nat Primrose League meetings and Liberal and Radical demonstrations\r\nat which hardly one word of sense or truth is uttered, but at which\r\nnevertheless the novice finds himself in a sympathetic atmosphere, so\r\neven the Fabian Society consists largely of Socialists who sowed their\r\nwild oats in one or other of these little sects of Impossibilists.\r\nTherefore we not only suffer them as gladly as human nature allows,\r\nbut give them what help and countenance we can when we can do so\r\nwithout specifically endorsing their blunders. Fortunately the immense\r\nadditions which have been made to the machinery of democracy in\r\nEngland in the last twenty years, from the County Councils of 1888 to\r\nthe education authorities of 1902, have acted as schools of public\r\nlife to thousands of men of small means who in the old days must have\r\nremained Impossibilists from want of public experience. One hour on\r\na responsible committee of a local authority which has to provide\r\nfor some public want and spend some public money, were it but half a\r\ncrown, will cure any sensible man of Impossibilism for the rest of his\r\nlife. And such cures are taking place every day, and converting futile\r\nenthusiasts into useful Fabians.\r\n\r\nA word as to this book. It is not a new edition of Fabian Essays. They\r\nare reprinted exactly as they appeared in 1889, nothing being changed\r\nbut the price. No other course was possible. When the essays were\r\nwritten, the Essayists were in their thirties: they are now in their\r\nfifties, except the one, William Clarke, who is in his grave. We were\r\nthen regarded as young desperadoes who had sacrificed their chances in\r\nlife by committing themselves publicly to Socialism: we are now quoted\r\nas illustrations of the new theory that Socialists, like Quakers,\r\nprosper in this world. It is a dangerous theory; for Socialism, like\r\nall religions and all isms, can turn weak heads as well as inspire\r\nand employ strong ones; but we, at all events, have been fortunate\r\nenough to have had our claim to public attention admitted in the\r\nnineteen years which have elapsed since our youthful escapade as Fabian\r\nEssayists.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that in our present position, and with the\r\nexperience we have gained, we should produce a very different book if\r\nthe work were to be done anew. We should not waste our time in killing\r\ndead horses, however vigorously they were kicking in 1889. We should\r\ncertainly be much more careful not to give countenance to the notion\r\nthat the unemployed can be set to work to inaugurate Socialism; though\r\nit remains true that the problem of the unemployed, from the moment\r\nwhen we cease to abandon them callously to their misery or soothe\r\nour consciences foolishly by buying them off with alms, will force\r\nus to organize them, provide for them, and train them; but the very\r\nfirst condition of success in this will be the abandonment of the\r\nold idea that the unemployed tailor can be set to make clothes for\r\nthe unemployed bootmaker and the unemployed bootmaker to make boots\r\nfor the unemployed tailor, the real difficulty being, not a scarcity\r\nof clothes and boots, but a stupid misdistribution of the money to\r\nbuy them. We should also probably lay more stress on human volition\r\nand less on economic pressure and historic evolution as making for\r\nSocialism. We should, in short, give the dry practice of our solutions\r\nof social problems instead of the inspiration and theory of them. But\r\nwe should also produce a volume which, though it might appeal more than\r\nthe present one to administrative experts, to bankers, lawyers, and\r\nconstructive statesmen, would have much less charm for the young, and\r\nfor the ordinary citizen who is in these matters an amateur.\r\n\r\nBesides, the difference between the view of the young and the\r\nelderly is not necessarily a difference between wrong and right. The\r\nTennysonian process of making stepping stones of our dead selves to\r\nhigher things is pious in intention, but it sometimes leads downstairs\r\ninstead of up. When Herbert Spencer in his later days expunged from\r\nhis Social Statics the irresistible arguments for Land Nationalization\r\nby which he anticipated Henry George, we could not admit that the old\r\nSpencer had any right to do this violence to the young Spencer, or\r\nwas less bound either to confute his position or admit it than if the\r\ntwo had been strangers to one another. Having had this lesson, we do\r\nnot feel free to alter even those passages which no longer represent\r\nour latest conclusions. Fortunately, in the main we have nothing to\r\nwithdraw, nothing to regret, nothing to apologize for, and much to be\r\nproud of. So we leave our book as it first came into the world, merely\r\nwriting “Errors Excepted” as solicitors do: that is, with the firm\r\nconviction that the errors, if they exist at all, do not greatly matter.\r\n\r\n_21st May, 1908._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FABIAN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM CLARKE, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo visitor to the British capital will mingle very long in the\r\npolitical life of London before he will hear of the Fabian Society. Few\r\nreaders have not heard of the Roman general, Quinctus Fabius Maximus,\r\n_qui cunctando restituit rem_, and who consequently received the title\r\nof Cunctator. That illustrious man is the patron saint of the society,\r\nthrough which, being dead, he yet speaketh.\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society proposes then to conquer by delay; to carry its\r\nprogrammes, not by a hasty rush, but through the slower but, as it\r\nthinks, surer methods of patient discussion, exposition, and political\r\naction of those who are absolutely convinced in their own minds. For a\r\nconvenient motto the society has taken the following sentence: “For the\r\nright moment you must wait, as Fabius did, most patiently, when warring\r\nagainst Hannibal, though many censured his delays; but when the time\r\ncomes you must strike hard, as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in\r\nvain and fruitless.” This double policy then, of waiting and striking,\r\nis the general idea of the society.\r\n\r\nWhat now are the aims of the society? I quote from the official\r\nprogramme: “The Fabian Society consists of Socialists. It therefore\r\naims at the reorganization of society by the emancipation of land and\r\nindustrial capital from individual and class ownership, and the vesting\r\nof them in the community for the general benefit. In this way only can\r\nthe natural and acquired advantages of the country be equitably shared\r\nby the whole people. The society accordingly works for the extinction\r\nof private property in land, and of the consequent individual\r\nappropriation, in the form of rent, of the price paid for permission\r\nto use the earth, as well as for the advantages of superior soils and\r\nsites. The society, further, works for the transfer to the community\r\nof the administration of such industrial capital as can be managed\r\nsocially. For, owing to the monopoly of the means of production in the\r\npast, industrial inventions and the transformation of surplus income\r\ninto capital have mainly enriched the proprietary class, the workers\r\nbeing now dependent on that class for leave to earn a living.” To bring\r\nthis condition of things about, the programme continues, the society\r\nlooks to the spread of Socialist opinions, and it seeks to promote\r\nthese by the general dissemination of knowledge as to the relation\r\nbetween the individual and society in its economic, ethical, and\r\npolitical aspects.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the fundamental ideas of the Fabian Society. Before\r\ndescribing its growth, work and personnel, let me give an account and\r\nexplanation of its origin. The effective modern Socialist movement\r\nin England began in 1881. In that year a conference was held at the\r\nWestminster Palace Hotel in London, at which were present the venerable\r\nFrancis W. Newman, brother of the late cardinal; Helen Taylor, the\r\nstep-daughter of John Stuart Mill; Mr. Hyndman, the Socialist author\r\nand leader; some men now in Parliament, others who have been there,\r\nand a small number of energetic people well known in London, but not\r\nequally well known in America. These persons and others formed, after\r\nmuch discussion, the Democratic Federation, a body which at first\r\nappeared to be nothing more than a vigorous Radical protest against the\r\nIrish coercive policy of the Gladstone Cabinet then in power. Immense\r\ndemonstrations, some of the biggest ever held in London, were got up\r\nby the Federation, who secured the adherence in this cause of some of\r\nthe Irish members of Parliament. But gradually the mere Radicalism\r\ndropped out of the Federation’s programme; and under the stimulating\r\ninfluence of Mr. Henry George, who was then in England, whose book was\r\nbeing read everywhere, and who enjoyed much influence then in England,\r\nthe Federation preached the doctrine of the “land for the people.” But\r\na still further stage in its evolution was to be reached; and by the\r\nautumn of 1883 it came out as a full-blown Socialist organization, and\r\npublished a little pamphlet entitled “Socialism Made Plain,” which had\r\na great run and which, singular as it may seem now, created a perfect\r\nconsternation among persons who supposed that Socialism was merely a\r\nFrench or German eccentricity, due to militarism and protectionism,\r\nand that it could never rear its head in “free” England. Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer, among others, took alarm and predicted a “coming slavery,”\r\nand the venerable _Quarterly Review_ shook its venerable head and\r\nmarvelled, like Mrs. Sarah Gamp, at the “brajian imperence” of these\r\nwicked agitators. It was perfectly evident that a new political force\r\nwas come into being.\r\n\r\nBut there were those in London who, sympathizing deeply with the new\r\nmovement, nevertheless could not throw themselves heartily into it, for\r\ntwo reasons: first, it assumed that a revolutionary change affecting\r\nthe very bases of society could be brought about all at once; second,\r\nit appeared to ignore what may be called the spiritual side of life,\r\nand to disregard the ethical changes necessary to render a different\r\nsocial system possible. Such was the state of things in the autumn of\r\n1883, when a very able man, Mr. Thomas Davidson, of New York, whom all\r\nwho have meet him know to be a man of exceptional force and enthusiasm,\r\nspent some weeks in London. Mr. Davidson, noting the condition of\r\nthings, gathered round him little conferences of men, at several of\r\nwhich I was present; and while he was in London, and for several months\r\nafter, these purely informal conferences went on at different people’s\r\nhouses. It would be too long a tale to tell of the endless discussions\r\nwhich took place, of the dull men and the brilliant men, the cranks and\r\nthe thinkers, the men with long hair and the women with short hair,\r\nwho debated and argued, and went for one another, and then debated and\r\nargued again. The main upshot was that these persons found themselves\r\nultimately divided into two camps, not necessarily hostile, but laying\r\nemphasis on different aspects of the social movement. One of these was\r\ncomposed of persons who laid supreme stress on the need for ethical and\r\nspiritual change as a constant factor in the social movement, and as a\r\ncoefficient with the material changes. These persons formed themselves\r\ninto a little body called the New Fellowship, which still exists, small\r\nin numbers, but very earnest in purpose, and which publishes a small\r\nquarterly journal called _Seedtime_. The other class, which agreed\r\nwith the Social Democratic Federation as to the urgent need for social\r\nand political change, but thought this must be very gradual, and its\r\nleaders persons of some culture and grasp of economics, formed the\r\nFabian Society. This is the genesis of this active body.\r\n\r\nThere is a prevalent view, expressed sometimes in American newspapers,\r\nthat the Socialist movement is largely made up of cranks and\r\nscoundrels--a view shared in a less degree by a portion of the English\r\npress. I believe there is in every country and age an abundant crop\r\nof both these classes; and assuredly the Socialist, like every other\r\nmovement, has had its share of both. But to suppose that a great\r\nmovement which is sweeping Europe from end to end, which has given\r\nbirth to the largest single political party in Germany, which has\r\ngained victories innumerable in France, which is modifying the whole of\r\nEnglish political life--to suppose that this movement is the outcome of\r\nthe delusions of a few wicked or foolish men, is itself the delusion\r\nof people who are probably themselves not over-good or over-wise. In\r\nMarx, Lassalle, Rodbertus, Malon and others, the Socialist movement\r\nhas been served by some of the best brains of our century; and it\r\nwas no idle boast of Lassalle that he was equipped with all the best\r\nculture of his time. I know the inside of the Socialist movement well,\r\nand it certainly numbers among its adherents the ablest men I know.\r\nThe Fabian Society contains not a few of these men. Walter Crane,\r\nthe artist; Stopford Brooke, the preacher and man of letters; Grant\r\nAllen, one of the most versatile and accomplished men living; George\r\nBernard Shaw, one of the most brilliant albeit whimsical of musical\r\nand dramatic critics; Miss Willard, one of America’s women reformers;\r\nProfessor Shuttleworth, now London’s most popular and able Broad\r\nChurch clergyman; Mr. D. G. Ritchie, of Oxford, foremost among English\r\nphilosophic thinkers; Mrs. Theodore Wright, one of our most powerful\r\nactresses; Sergius Stepniak, next to Tolstoi the first of living\r\nRussians; Alfred Hayes, one of the first of our younger poets; Dr.\r\nFurnival, most learned and active of old English scholars,--these are\r\namong its members.\r\n\r\nBut it is not, of course, the mere inclusion of eminent people that\r\ngives a society force and authority. It is the being grounded in\r\nknowledge and ideas; and here the society is strong. It was recognized\r\nfrom the first by its members that the social problem cannot be\r\nsolved by mere sentiment, though sentiment must be a factor in its\r\nsolution. There must be a deal of hard thinking and severe study, not\r\naltogether in books (many of which on the economic problems before us\r\nare worthless), but in social facts. Its critics think the society\r\nhas erred on the other side, and become too hard, and even cynical;\r\nbut I confess I think that better than talking mere gushing moral\r\nplatitudes which people applaud and then forget all about. The society\r\nhas always steadily kept before it the idea that we are not looking\r\nfor any millennium, any perfectly blissful earthly paradise, but that\r\nwe are considering the much more prosaic question, how the economic\r\ninterests of society are to be served, how the economic arrangements\r\nof society are to be carried on. Hence its members determined to equip\r\nthemselves for their work by hard reading and thinking and by very\r\nstiff discussion of the crucial problems in history, economics and\r\npolitical philosophy. To this end they were greatly aided by a useful\r\nlittle Historical Society, which was formed in one of the suburbs of\r\nLondon, where every week an essay was read and completely discussed. I\r\ndo not believe there are any better read or more acute minds in England\r\nthan these of the young men who formed this group and who have largely\r\nremained the nucleus of the Fabian Society,--and this though they have\r\ntheir faults, like other people.\r\n\r\nAt first the idea was to have a very small number of members, scarcely\r\nmore than could be gathered in a good-sized room in a private house.\r\nThese were to be well trained and to be apostles. Gradually, however,\r\nthe society grew and grew, the barriers of exclusion were broken\r\ndown, and persons of less knowledge and experience were brought in.\r\nAt the present time I think almost all callings are represented in\r\nthe society. I find in the last list of members, lawyers, artists,\r\njournalists, doctors, workingmen, clergymen, teachers, trade-union\r\nleaders, literary people, shop-keepers and persons of no occupation.\r\nThere are no millionnaires in the society, as there are no paupers, but\r\nthere are a few quite well-to-do people. A large proportion are bright\r\nyoung men, and there are not a few bright and active women. Individual\r\ninstances of the sort of people who belong and what they do are better\r\nthan mere vague generalizations. Here are cases:--\r\n\r\nA young man employed in the Central Post-Office at a salary of $650 a\r\nyear. He has married a very charming and able girl, also a member. They\r\noccupy two or three rooms in a suburban house. The young lady has been\r\nelected as a guardian of the poor, the only woman among a number of\r\nmen. Her husband devotes nearly all his spare time after office-hours\r\nto the society’s propaganda. He has had a little portable desk and\r\nstand made for himself, and at this he speaks in open spaces on street\r\ncorners or wherever he can get an audience. His wife accompanies him\r\nand sells literature. Do not suppose that these are a blatant young\r\ndemagogue and a conventional, strong-minded woman. Both are educated,\r\nintelligent, of sweet disposition; but the Socialist movement has taken\r\nhold of them and given them something they needed, lifted them above\r\nthe region of what John Morley calls “greasy domesticity,” and taught\r\nthem that there is a great suffering world beyond the four walls of\r\nhome to be helped and worked for. Depend upon it, a movement which can\r\ndo this has in it some promise of the future.\r\n\r\nOr take the amusing, cynical, remarkable George Bernard Shaw, whose\r\nIrish humor and brilliant gifts have partly helped, partly hindered,\r\nthe society’s popularity. This man will rise from an elaborate\r\ncriticism of last night’s opera or Richter concert (he is the musical\r\ncritic of the _World_), and after a light, purely vegetarian meal, will\r\ngo down to some far-off club in South London, or to some street-corner\r\nin East London, or to some recognized place of meeting in one of the\r\nparks, and will there speak to poor men about their economic position\r\nand their political duties. People of this sort, who enjoy books and\r\nmusic and the theatre and good society, do not go down to dreary slums\r\nor even more dreary lecture-rooms to speak on such themes to the poorer\r\nclass of workingmen without some strong impelling power; and it is that\r\npower, that motive force, upon which I dwell, as showing what is doing\r\nin the London of to-day. I am satisfied, from inquiries I have made,\r\nthat there is really nothing like this going on in any other country of\r\nthe world; but it is a commonplace in London.\r\n\r\nThe original parent Fabian Society, after it began to expand and\r\nemploy a paid secretary and become a recognized institution, suggested\r\nto people elsewhere that they might have local Fabian Societies; and\r\nthe first of these were formed in Birmingham, where several of the\r\nmembers addressed crowded, very intelligent and very enthusiastic\r\naudiences in a hall in the centre of that city. There are also local\r\nFabian Societies now in Manchester, Edinburgh, Bristol, Leeds,\r\nNewcastle, Plymouth, Wolverhampton, Bradford, York and other English\r\ntowns, altogether forty-eight in number; and there is also one in\r\nAdelaide, South Australia, and another in Bombay. Some of these are\r\nquite small, but others are important, and are beginning to exercise a\r\nconsiderable influence in municipal politics, and in one or two places\r\nin Parliamentary politics also. The society has been represented at\r\nInternational Labor Congresses in Paris, Brussels, Zürich and Chicago.\r\n\r\nAnd now what has in the main been the sort of work the society has\r\ndone? At first the idea of its members was rather to discuss among\r\nthemselves and teach themselves than to teach others. This was the\r\ninitial or self-forming stage. Then came the educational stage, and,\r\nthird, the political or active stage, though even in this, its third\r\nstage, education is still the main object of the society. Fortnightly\r\ndiscussions have been kept up continuously, save for a two months’\r\nsummer recess, for years. At these members of the society read papers,\r\nor outsiders, and notably opponents, were invited. The late Charles\r\nBradlaugh came to oppose, and was very promptly demolished; while, on\r\nthe other hand, Oscar Wilde has spoken with eloquence and power on\r\nthe relation of art and Socialism. The society tried to get Mr. A.\r\nJ. Balfour, the Conservative leader, and Mr. W. H. Mallock, as the\r\nablest literary opponent of Socialism, to come and argue seriously,\r\nbut neither of them would do so. Mr. Haldene, the translator of\r\nSchopenhauer and cultured philosophic member of Parliament, came\r\nto oppose, was handled rather vigorously, and has now been largely\r\nconverted to collectivism. Mr. David F. Schloss, whom the British\r\nGovernment recently sent over to the United States to inquire into\r\nlabor matters, has spoken sympathetically; and Mr. Donisthorpe, the\r\nclever, cynical, superficial English individualist, has spoken and\r\nhas been mercilessly handled. The result of all this debating is that\r\nthe Fabian Society has now some of the best debaters in England. It\r\nhas also some of the best lecturers, for it is in lectures that its\r\nwork has largely consisted. The society now gives something over one\r\nthousand lectures a year, all free, the lecturers being all unpaid.\r\nIndeed, excepting the secretary’s office, the whole of the society’s\r\nwork is voluntary, unpaid work. The majority of these lectures\r\nare given in workmen’s clubs, of which there are some hundreds in\r\nLondon alone. I take at random from the 1891 list of lectures sample\r\nsubjects:--\r\n\r\nThe Socialism of John Ruskin; The Eight Hours’ Bill; Railway Reform;\r\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity; Methods of Social Evolution; Adam, the\r\nfirst and last Individualist; Why we want a Labor Party; The Gospel\r\nof getting on; What the Farm Laborers want; The Social Hell and its\r\nSources; Experiments in Housing the People; Socialism and Individual\r\nLiberty; the Church’s Message to Men of Wealth; Free Comments on the\r\nPopulation Question; The Worker’s Share of Wealth; The Programme\r\nof Social Democracy; John Lilburne and the Levellers; The Chartist\r\nMovement; The Religion of Socialism; the Industrial History of England;\r\nGospel of Bread and Butter; Workingmen and their Difficulties;\r\nCo-operative Production and Socialism; Wealth and the Commonwealth; The\r\nFrench Revolution; The Right to Live; What Socialists Propose to Do;\r\nTwenty Years of the Labor Movement.\r\n\r\nFrom these it will be seen what extensive ground is covered. These\r\nlectures are for the most part delivered to workingmen, but sometimes\r\nthere are middle-class audiences, and I have heard of Fabian lecturers\r\ntalking to people in aristocratic drawing-rooms. From the first, the\r\nsociety has done some publishing, and the last list gives no fewer than\r\nforty-five pamphlets or tracts issued by the society. The first of\r\nthese, “Why are the Many Poor?” was a crude one, but good for rousing\r\nattention, which is always the first thing to be done, and quite\r\njustifying some curious Socialistic vagaries. The most valuable of\r\nthese pamphlets are “Facts for Socialists,” a really crushing answer\r\nto those whom Matthew Arnold calls the “self-complacent moles,” all\r\nbased on the best available statistics; “Facts for Londoners,” an\r\nappalling generalization of the economic condition of London; “What\r\nto Read,” a most admirable and impartially selected list of books for\r\nsocial reformers, which might with advantage be reprinted in America;\r\n“The Reform of the Poor Law”; and “The Impossibilities of Anarchism,” a\r\nsearching criticism of the Anarchist position by George Bernard Shaw.\r\nRemember that the preparation of these has all been voluntary, unpaid\r\nlabor, and has involved an immense amount of toil.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the society determined to give a course of lectures by those\r\nof its members who were supposed to be best fitted for the purpose,\r\nsetting forth the general principles of Socialism as they understood\r\nthem. The lectures were eight in number, and were delivered to densely\r\npacked audiences, making such an impression that it was decided to\r\npublish them in a volume; and in the next year they appeared, under\r\nthe title of “Fabian Essays in Socialism.” As it is a case of _quorum\r\npars magna fui_, I am precluded from giving my estimate of a volume\r\nin which I had a share; but I may say that this work has had a very\r\ngreat sale--thirty thousand copies, the largest sale of any purely\r\neconomic work I know of excepting “Progress and Poverty,”--and that\r\nits respectful and even cordial welcome by the English press was a\r\nsurprise. The fact shows that the public mind is being prepared for\r\ngreat social changes. The ruling idea of the book is that of inevitable\r\npolitical and industrial evolution,--nothing in the least degree\r\nmerely utopian, but an attempted generalization on the lines of modern\r\nscientific ideas. The publication of this book first gave to the Fabian\r\nSociety a national instead of a merely local reputation; and I believe\r\nthe book has now been widely read in America and Germany, while it was\r\nintroduced to France by the _Revue Socialiste_. Several courses of\r\nlectures have since been given by the society, but none of them have\r\nbeen afterwards published.\r\n\r\nThe third phase of the society’s activity is, as I have said, in\r\npractical politics. This was not undertaken without some misgivings.\r\nOn the principle that you cannot touch pitch without being defiled, I\r\nconfess I doubted whether, until the people had been far more educated\r\nin these ideas, it was wise to enter the somewhat dirty political\r\narena. But the intense desire to be _doing_ something, to translate\r\nideas into facts, to organize the people, to help in shaping the\r\nactual progressive movement in England, and above all, perhaps, to\r\nweaken and destroy the individualist wing of the Liberal party,--these\r\nand other motives acted with cumulative force, especially as members\r\nof the society began to find that they had acquired influence over\r\nlittle groups of workmen here and there. There were great dangers and\r\ndifficulties. There was the danger of falling into mere wire-pulling\r\nand making of political “deals,”--a subject about which people in\r\nAmerica know so much that it is not necessary to enlarge upon it; and\r\nthen there was the practical difficulty of differences of opinion in\r\nthe society, which might cause wreck if political action were indulged\r\nin. I may say at once that these difficulties remain and will continue\r\nto do so, though they have not led to disruption yet. There are\r\ninveterate wire-pullers in the society, and there are those who favor\r\nan independent labor party, those who want to permeate the Radicals and\r\ngradually gain them over; and there are even a few who, as between the\r\ntwo parties, prefer Tories to Radicals. The first political chance for\r\nthe Fabian Society came at the London county council election in 1889,\r\nwhen the advanced party in London paid the society the compliment of\r\nappropriating its entire pamphlet, “The London Programme,” and making\r\nof it the Progressive platform of the campaign. The Progressives\r\ncarried that election, and they carried it on “The London Programme.”\r\nStill more striking was the Progressive victory in 1892, when the\r\nModerate or Conservative party was almost annihilated at the polls.\r\nThe Fabian Society has supplied London with its programme of reforms;\r\nand the reforms were in the direction of what it is now the fashion\r\nto call municipal Socialism. At the second county council election,\r\nseveral Fabians were candidates, and four of them were actually\r\nelected; while a fifth, Ben Tillett, the labor leader, was afterwards\r\nmade an alderman. Three members of the society proved formidable though\r\nunsuccessful candidates at the Parliamentary election two years ago.\r\nA considerable number of members are on local municipal councils and\r\nschool boards, and another fought a very remarkable Parliamentary fight\r\nduring the last year. So it is clear that the society is largely _en\r\nevidence_.\r\n\r\nAs to the general programme of work in which the members are supposed\r\nmore or less to take part, I may quote from the printed advice given\r\nto members as to what they can do. First of all, “the need of study”\r\nis insisted on. It is assumed that the member will read all the\r\nsociety’s publications; and his next duty, it is urged, should be to\r\nread the criticisms on the other side, after the manner of Cicero, who\r\nwas always careful to get up his opponent’s case. If a member cannot\r\nread or study alone, he is recommended to set on foot a local reading\r\ncircle, and apply to the secretary for literature for the circle.\r\nNo public work should be done until this self-education has been\r\naccomplished, and the member is really able to speak with authority\r\nand to deal effectively with an opponent. The opponents of Socialism\r\nin England are usually persons sent out by a body called the Liberty\r\nand Property Defence League, of which the American millionnaire,\r\nMr. Astor, now a London Tory newspaper proprietor, is a member.\r\nThese persons have, as a rule, a remarkable capacity for making\r\nfools of themselves; nevertheless, it is always a tactical blunder\r\nto underestimate the ability of your opponent, and Fabian lecturers\r\nare advised to assume that these Liberty and Property defenders are\r\nacquainted with economics, even though there is good reason to suspect\r\nthey are not. There is nothing that kills like ridicule; to gibbet an\r\nignorant and presumptuous debater, and make him look like a fool before\r\na large audience, is a source of pleasure to every rightly constituted\r\nmind. Members of the society are also urged to correspond with their\r\nParliamentary or municipal representative on all vital points, to worry\r\nhis life out of him if he is obstinate or wrong-headed or dishonest,\r\nand to make him yearn like the poet for a lodge in some vast wilderness\r\nwhere he might never receive another letter or vote of censure as long\r\nas he lived. This is a good way to combat what Walt Whitman calls “the\r\nnever-ending audacity of elected persons.” The member should always\r\nattend the local caucus meeting, and do what he can there; and if he\r\nhas the time to spare, he should be a candidate for any public post,\r\nsuch as member of Parliament, of county or municipal council, of\r\nschool board, guardian of the poor, or member of the parish council\r\nyet to be constituted. The great difficulty in the way of this is that\r\nthese public persons are not paid in England, and few of the busy and\r\nimpecunious members of the Fabian Society can afford the time for these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the constitution, work, and general character\r\nof the Fabian Society, let me speak on the general intellectual\r\nforces which have been operating in England to bring about this new\r\npolitical growth among active young men; for it is quite new. My first\r\nacquaintance with anything that could properly be called Socialism\r\nin England was in London in 1879, when I went one evening to hear a\r\nyoung Jewish gentleman, since deceased, Mr. Montefiore, read a paper\r\non German Socialism, before the London Dialectical Society. Mr.\r\nMontefiore had but a slender knowledge of his subject, and we had to\r\nwait for speeches by a German friend of Marx, resident in London, and\r\nfrom a young, dreamy-looking man with long, thick, tousled hair, whom\r\nI learned was Mr. Ernest Belfort Bax, since better known as a prolific\r\nwriter on Socialism from the revolutionary, Marxite point of view. At\r\nthat time there was not a single young man in London interested in or\r\nin favor of anything like Socialism, excepting Mr. Bax. Now there are\r\nhundreds. What are the reasons for the change?\r\n\r\n(1) The exhaustion of the older Liberalism and the obviously\r\nunsatisfactory character of mere republicanism. And here American\r\nreaders must permit me to be plain by saying that the United States\r\nseemed to furnish an object lesson to the world as to the failure of\r\nmere republicanism to solve a single one of our social questions. A\r\nquarter of a century ago the American Republic was the guiding star of\r\nadvanced English political thought. It is not so now: candor compels\r\nme to say that. It is not merely a question of machine politics, of\r\npolitical corruption, of the omnipotent party boss; though supine\r\nAmericans who do nothing to overthrow those purely political evils\r\nshould be reminded that Europe as well as America is involved in\r\nand has to pay for their cowardice and indifference. But over and\r\nbeyond this is the great fact of the division between rich and poor,\r\nmillionnaires at one end, tramps at the other, a growth of monopolies\r\nunparalleled, crises producing abject poverty just as in Europe. These\r\nfacts proved to men clearly that new institutions were of no use along\r\nwith the old forms of property; that a mere theoretic democracy,\r\nunaccompanied by any social changes, was a delusion and a snare. The\r\nresult of this is that the old enthusiasm for mere republicanism has\r\ndied away, and that, though twenty-five years ago there was a good\r\nsprinkling of republican clubs in England, there is not a single one of\r\nthem left now.\r\n\r\n(2) The second cause I take to be a new spirit in literature. The\r\ngenteel, the conventional, the thinner kind of romantic literature\r\nbegan to die out; and the powerful realistic school began to attract\r\nmen’s minds. There was a desire to know things as they are, to sound\r\nthe plummet in the sea of social misery, to have done with make-believe\r\nand get at realities. The Russian writers, with their intense\r\nSocialistic feeling, attracted great numbers of readers, who seemed to\r\nfind in them something entirely new and immensely powerful. I should\r\nname among individual writers who have powerfully aided the growth, I\r\ndo not say of Socialism itself, but of the feeling in the soil of which\r\nSocialism is easily developed, Dickens, Victor Hugo, Carlyle, Whitman,\r\nRuskin, Tolstoi, Zola and Arnold. A curious and medley list, you may\r\nsay, and so it is; but I am certain that each of these great writers\r\nhas contributed a distinct element to the expansion and liberation of\r\nthe minds that have been formed, say, during the last twenty years. For\r\namong all these writers, varied as they are, it is the social feeling\r\nwhich is the most powerful impulse.\r\n\r\n(3) Along with the new literature has grown a new art feeling, an\r\nintense hatred of the smug and respectable, and a love to be surrounded\r\nby attractive objects. Ruskin, Morris, and Walter Crane have shown\r\nwhy it is that the true artist is at war with commercialism, with\r\nthe notion that things are to be produced for a profit, no matter\r\nwhat abominations you may turn out. The conception that no person\r\nhas any right to inflict an ugly object of any sort on the world,\r\nespecially for the sake of making gain out of it, has taken hold on the\r\nimaginative mind of the younger people of our cultivated classes.\r\n\r\n(4) In the fourth place, the old political economy is absolutely dead\r\nin England, although you might not perhaps guess it from some of the\r\nEnglish economic writers. The influence of German thought in this,\r\nas in other departments, has affected men’s minds. Take a series of\r\nbooks like the Social Science Series, published by Sonnenschein;\r\nhalf those books are Socialistic,--and that would have been an\r\nimpossibility twenty years ago. Of the “Fabian Essays in Socialism,”\r\nit may be said that the publisher, as well as the Society, reaped\r\nlarge profits from it. I mention such works as these, rather than\r\nromances like Morris’s “News from Nowhere,” or Bellamy’s “Looking\r\nBackward.” The charm of Morris’s style and the ingenuity of Bellamy’s\r\nnarrative would be sufficient to account for their success; but the\r\npopularity of these other works represents a body of serious interest\r\nin advanced economics, which may well be considered startling when the\r\nold hidebound prejudices of orthodox English economics are taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n(5) _Laissez-faire_ individualist political philosophy is dead. In\r\nvain does poor Mr. Herbert Spencer endeavor to stem the torrent. His\r\npolitical ideas are already as antiquated as Noah’s ark. I do not know\r\na single one of the younger men in England who is influenced by them\r\nin the slightest degree, though one hears of one occasionally, just\r\nas one hears of a freak in a dime museum. For all practical purposes,\r\nphilosophic Radicalism, as it was called, is as extinct as the dodo.\r\n\r\n(6) There is another cause which cannot be ignored, though I speak upon\r\nit with some hesitation, as I purposely avoid, as far as possible, the\r\ndifficult questions of religion and the deeper ethics. I mean that\r\nthe old dualism, with its creed of other-worldliness, has gone by the\r\nboard. Whatever men’s theoretical views are upon many transcendental\r\nmatters, there is a general feeling now that the world is one, and\r\nthat actual life here is just as sacred, normal, good, as it ever was\r\nor ever will be in any hypothetical past or future; that if there is\r\nany heaven for us we have to make it, and that such heaven is a state\r\nof the mind, of human relationships, and not a place to be reached at\r\na definite period of time. Perhaps I may quote the eloquent words of\r\nWilliam Morris in his “Dream of John Ball”: “Fellowship is heaven, and\r\nthe lack of fellowship is hell.” This idea is, I say, a powerful factor\r\nin leading the minds of the younger men to the views of which I am\r\nspeaking. But men are not altogether influenced by their theoretical\r\nor even spiritual ideas; they are also moved, and so long as they have\r\nmaterial bodies to be fed and clothed they will continue to be moved,\r\nby purely self-regarding and economic considerations. Let us never be\r\ndeluded into supposing that altruistic feelings alone will induce men\r\nto make great social changes; egotistic considerations will prompt them\r\nas well, the desire of self-preservation working along with the desire\r\nfor a better and more harmonious social order than exists. It is not\r\nonly upon the working classes that capitalist monopoly tells; it tells\r\nalso upon the educated middle classes who are not in the monopoly. They\r\nfind the avenues of livelihood and preferment one after another closed\r\nto them; and just as education spreads, this will become more and more\r\nthe case. When a small number of persons in a large community are\r\nhighly educated, they have what economists call a monopoly value; they\r\ncan get a good price for their services, because they possess something\r\nwhich few people have. Spread this higher education and the monopoly\r\nis broken down. Now, this is roughly what is going on in society;\r\ndemocracy is levelling all up to a common level, however gradual may be\r\nthe process; and consequently highly educated men with their special\r\ngifts find their rates of remuneration becoming lower and lower, unless\r\nthey possess some rare gift of genius, as a Sara Bernhardt in acting,\r\na Paderewski in playing, a Stevenson in story-telling, a Mascagni as\r\na composer. These rare people still command their monopoly value; but\r\nfor the rest it has disappeared. Thus even more than the workingmen,\r\nperhaps, it has been the educated young men of the middle class\r\n(and the young women, too) who have been hardest hit by the modern\r\ndevelopment. Fifty years ago you could have gathered all the press\r\nwriters of London into a single moderate-sized room. To-day all told\r\nthey number nearly ten thousand. Everybody with a pen, ink and paper\r\nand any capacity for turning out “copy” is a journalist; and you see\r\nat once that it is impossible for all these men to earn a living. They\r\ndon’t, and can’t. There are scores of highly educated people who work\r\nevery day in the British Museum for eight or nine hours a day and earn\r\nless than a mechanic in constant occupation. It is the same in all the\r\nprofessions. Only fifteen per cent of London advocates ever get briefs\r\nat all; the other eighty-five per cent get nothing. In the medical\r\nprofession it is the same. The prizes go to about five per cent of the\r\nprofession; as for the average medical man in the London suburbs, the\r\nrates are so cut that I am credibly informed by one of them who studied\r\nat Cambridge and Heidelberg, and on whose education hundreds of pounds\r\nwere spent, the fee for attendance and prescription in his suburban\r\ndistrict has been brought down to twenty-five cents. It will be seen\r\nthat it is not a question of making money or of the disgusting progress\r\ntowards smug respectability, which is known as “getting on,”--it is\r\npositively a question of a bare living. Now, while a workingman who has\r\nnever known comfort, whose father has never known it before him, can\r\noften stand a frightful amount of poverty without getting desperate,\r\nthe well-bred young man cannot; and the result is that the keenest and\r\nmost dangerous discontent comes from the educated classes, who are\r\nleading the Socialist masses all over Europe. Some superficial people\r\nthink the remedy is to be found in inducing young men of the better\r\nclasses to abandon the so-called “respectable” occupations and go in\r\nfor manual labor. Let them cease, by all means, to be “respectable,”\r\nbut let not any one lay the flattering unction to his soul that this,\r\nunder existing economic conditions, is any solution. For what is the\r\ndifficulty about manual labor now? Why, that thousands of those already\r\nengaged in it are not wanted; it is the difficulty of the unemployed,\r\nthe difficulty of over-production. In 1886, according to the Report\r\nof the Washington Bureau of Statistics, there were at least one and\r\none-half million of unemployed men in the United States; and this state\r\nof things has been almost if not quite paralleled in 1893. In London\r\nlack of employment is chronic, and is growing to such huge proportions\r\nthat our cowardly, blind, public men dare not grapple with it. In\r\nAustralia the unemployed have been walking the streets of Melbourne by\r\nthe thousand. How absurd then it is to propose to add to the numbers of\r\nworkingmen when those already in the ranks cannot find means of living!\r\nThere is one method, alas, open to men, as there is always one method\r\nopen to tempted, poverty-stricken women,--the method of what I may call\r\nintellectual prostitution; and many there be that go in at that gate.\r\nSick and weary of the penury and struggle that go with honesty, young\r\nmen of ability will deliberately sell themselves to the capitalist\r\nwho has cornered our intellectual as he has cornered our material\r\nproduction, and will serve him for a good living. What numbers I have\r\nknown choose this path!--and I cannot blame them, for they are forced\r\ninto it by the conditions of modern life. It is useless preaching fine\r\nmorals to them; the conditions of life must be adapted to human nature\r\nas it is, for human nature will not, you may be quite sure, suddenly\r\ntransform itself to suit the conditions. These, then, are the economic\r\nmotives which, combined with the moral and intellectual motives to\r\nwhich I have previously given expression, are forcing young men of\r\neducation and good breeding into the ranks of the Socialists, and which\r\nespecially operate in the case of a body like the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nReaders will be asking by this time whether I am not going to set\r\nforth the actual political programme or “platform,” as it is called\r\nin America, of the Fabian Society. Yes, that is just what I am going\r\nto do. As the Fabian Society holds that social transformation must\r\nbe gradual, unless there is to be a general smash-up, it proposes a\r\nseries of reforms for effecting the gradual change of society into\r\na really social democratic state. But these reforms, it will be\r\nunderstood, are adopted with a distinct end in view, which fact makes\r\nall the difference between people of principle and mere opportunists\r\nwho have no end in view other than the personal end of lining their\r\nown pockets. The following, then, are the planks of the Fabian\r\npolitical platform: Adult suffrage, Parliamentary and municipal,\r\none vote for each man and each woman of twenty-one and upwards who\r\nare not in prison or in a lunatic asylum. The second ballot, as in\r\nFrance, Germany and Switzerland, so that whoever is elected will have\r\nan absolute majority of the votes polled. Payment of members by the\r\nstate and of election expenses by the district (it must be remembered\r\nthat at present representatives are not paid in England). Taxation of\r\nunearned incomes by such means as a land tax, heavy death duties to\r\ngo to municipalities, and a progressive income tax. Municipalization\r\nof land and local industries, so that free and honorable municipal\r\nemployment may be substituted for private charity, which, to vary a\r\nwell-known line of Shakespeare, is twice cursed,--it curseth him who\r\ngives and him who takes. All education to be at the public cost for all\r\nclasses, including manual as well as book training. Nationalization\r\nof all canals and railways, so that the public highways may belong to\r\nthe public, as they always did until the new era of steam, when they\r\ngot into the hands of capitalists. It is as ridiculous to pay Mr.\r\nVanderbilt if you happen to want to go from New York to Chicago as it\r\nwould be to pay him if you desired to take a walk down Fifth Avenue.\r\nThe eight hours day for wage-workers in all government and municipal\r\noffices, in all monopolies like coal mines and railways, and in all\r\nindustries where the workers want it. Parish councils for the laborers,\r\nwith compulsory power to acquire land to build dwellings, to administer\r\nschools and charities, and to engage in co-operative farming.\r\n\r\nSuch is the programme through the adoption of which the Fabian Society\r\nbelieves that the country once called “merry England,” but the greater\r\nportion of which is now dreary and sordid and cursed with poverty,\r\nmight again be really happy and be converted into a land of real and\r\nnot of sham freedom. And now a word, in conclusion, on an important\r\npoint,--the relation of the intellectual proletariat, as it has been\r\ncalled, to the masses, of the educated young men to the bulk of\r\nthe working classes. Most of the members of the Fabian Society are\r\neducated, middle-class people, though there are workingmen connected\r\nwith it also. What is to be the relation of these educated middle-class\r\npeople to the swarming multitudes of workers? This is a vital social\r\nquestion, the most vital we have immediately before us. One remembers\r\nwhat Matthew Arnold said in America,--that the salvation of modern\r\nsociety lay in the hands of a remnant. I should be inclined to put it\r\nrather differently, and to say that, if the social evolution is to be\r\npeaceful and rational, it must be effected by the union of a cultivated\r\nremnant with the masses of the toiling people. American optimism may\r\nchafe at the little word “if.” Can there be any doubt, you may ask,\r\nthat we shall go on prosperously and peacefully? I reply, yes, there is\r\nquite good enough ground for doubting this. As Mr. Pearson, the author\r\nof that remarkable book on “National Life and Character,” which has\r\nimpressed us in England very deeply, has said, ancient civilization in\r\nthe times of the Antonines seemed as firm and strong as does ours, nay,\r\nstronger, for it had, in the main, lasted as many centuries as ours has\r\nlasted decades.\r\n\r\n  Stout was its arm, each nerve and bone\r\n  Seemed puissant and alive.\r\n\r\nHad you predicted then to a Roman senator that the splendid Greco-Roman\r\ncities would be given to the flames, and that the Roman Senate and\r\nlegions would be trampled down by ignorant hordes of barbarians, he\r\nwould have smiled, offered you another cup of Falernian wine, and\r\nchanged the subject. Yet we know this happened; and I confess I can\r\nsee nothing in our mushroom civilization which we have any particular\r\nright to regard as inherently more enduring than the elaborate and\r\nstately organism of Roman jurisprudence. But there are no barbarians!\r\nYes, there are; but they are not outside us,--they are in our midst.\r\nDo you suppose that the grim victim of crushing poverty in a London\r\nattic or a Berlin cellar cares one pin’s head for all the heritage\r\nof the world’s thought which appeals to the highly educated? How are\r\nthese huge masses of poor people to be welded into a great phalanx,\r\nto be induced to subordinate their passions to the demands of reason,\r\nto look not merely at the needs of the moment, but at those of next\r\nyear, to realize that the world cannot be remade in a day, but yet\r\nthat it can be so reconstituted as to give all opportunities to live\r\nas human beings should? Silly people are always talking nonsense about\r\nthe danger of “agitators.” I know all about agitators. I know nearly\r\nevery prominent agitator in Great Britain; and I can say confidently\r\nthat it is the agitators who have to hold back, to restrain the people\r\nfrom rash and even mad action. The record of every English strike would\r\nshow that this was the case. If all the labor leaders and agitators\r\nwere silenced, it would be the very worst thing that could befall the\r\ncapitalist class. The masses are at present, at the very best, an army\r\nof privates without officers. This is not their fault; it is their\r\nmisfortune. They have not had the training, the culture, which enables\r\nthem to meet rich men and their agents on equal ground. An English\r\nstatesman, whose name is known the world over, said privately to me\r\nnot long ago: “The labor men here in the House of Commons are all good\r\nfellows, but they are no use as leaders; the principal men of either\r\nparty can twist them round their fingers with the greatest ease. If the\r\nlabor movement is to be a success, it must be led by educated men.” I\r\nbelieve that verdict of one of the ablest and best-informed public men\r\nnow living to be true. To what does it point? To the union of culture\r\nwith labor, to reform this badly-jointed system. Only, be it observed,\r\nit must be union on equal terms. There must be no lofty condescension\r\non the part of culture any more than base truckling on the part of\r\nlabor. It must be an equal copartnership, where each partner recognizes\r\nthat the other has something which he needs. And let me say, as one\r\nwho knows workmen, that, in a certain and very real way, culture has\r\nas much to learn from labor as labor from culture. Let the cultured\r\nman approach the laboring man on perfectly equal terms, in a cordial\r\nand open way; and let both unite to deliver a groaning world from the\r\nbondage of riches. English experience shows that this can be done;\r\nand this idea is to a very great degree the _idée mère_ of the Fabian\r\nSociety, whose members have no higher ambition than to mingle freely\r\nwith the workmen and share in the common life. By this means the hatred\r\nand suspicion felt by the French and German workmen towards any one who\r\nwears a black coat is eliminated, and both labor and culture gain in\r\nbreadth, knowledge and sympathy, and the cause of rational progress is\r\nrendered more secure. Walt Whitman has told us, in “Leaves of Grass,”\r\nhow he went “freely with powerful, uneducated persons,”--a gospel which\r\nMr. John Addington Symonds, in his essay on Whitman, tells us, saved\r\nhim from being a prig. And this gospel of free intercourse with the\r\nso-called “common people,” who are neither saints nor great sinners,\r\nbut real men, more real than the conventional middle-class man can\r\never afford to be, is the healthiest, best advice which I can give to\r\ncultivated men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FABIAN ESSAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essays in this volume were prepared last year as a course of\r\nlectures for delivery before mixed audiences in London and the\r\nprovinces. They have been revised for publication, but not recast. The\r\nmatter is put, not as an author would put it to a student, but as a\r\nspeaker with only an hour at his disposal has to put it to an audience.\r\nCountry readers may accept the book as a sample of the propaganda\r\ncarried on by volunteer lecturers in the workmen’s clubs and political\r\nassociations of London.[1] Metropolitan readers will have the advantage\r\nof making themselves independent of the press critic by getting face\r\nto face with the writers, stripping the veil of print from their\r\npersonality, cross-examining, criticising, calling them to account\r\namid surroundings which inspire no awe, and before the most patient\r\nof audiences. For any Sunday paper which contains a lecture list will\r\nshew where some, if not all, of the seven essayists may be heard for\r\nnothing; and on all such occasions questions and discussion form part\r\nof the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe projection and co-ordination of these lectures is not the work\r\nof any individual. The nominal editor is only the member told off to\r\narrange for the publication of the papers, and see them through the\r\npress with whatever editorial ceremony might be necessary. Everything\r\nthat is usually implied by the authorship and editing of a book has in\r\nthis case been done by the seven essayists, associated as the Executive\r\nCouncil of the Fabian Society; and not one of the essays could be\r\nwhat it is had the writer been a stranger to his six colleagues and\r\nto the Society. But there has been no sacrifice of individuality--no\r\nattempt to cut out every phrase and opinion the responsibility for\r\nwhich would not be accepted by every one of the seven. Had the sections\r\nbeen differently allotted, they would have been differently treated,\r\nthough the net result would probably have been the same. The writers\r\nare all Social Democrats, with a common conviction of the necessity of\r\nvesting the organization of industry and the material of production in\r\na State identified with the whole people by complete Democracy. But\r\nthat conviction is peculiar to no individual bias: it is a Capitol to\r\nwhich all roads lead; and at least seven of them are represented in\r\nthese Fabian Essays; so that the reader need not fear oppression here,\r\nany more than in the socialized State of the future, by the ascendancy\r\nof one particular cast of mind.\r\n\r\nThere are at present no authoritative teachers of Socialism. The\r\nessayists make no claim to be more than communicative learners.\r\n\r\n LONDON, December, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In the year ending April, 1889, the number of lectures delivered by\r\nmembers of the Fabian Society alone was upwards of 700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASIS OF SOCIALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC.\r\n\r\nBY G. BERNARD SHAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll economic analyses begin with the cultivation of the earth. To the\r\nmind’s eye of the astronomer, the earth is a ball spinning in space\r\nwithout ulterior motives. To the bodily eye of the primitive cultivator\r\nit is a vast green plain, from which, by sticking a spade into it,\r\nwheat and other edible matters can be made to spring. To the eye of the\r\nsophisticated city man, this vast green plain appears rather as a great\r\ngaming-table, your chances in the game depending chiefly on the place\r\nwhere you deposit your stakes. To the economist, again, the green plain\r\nis a sort of burial-place of hidden treasure, where all the forethought\r\nand industry of man are set at naught by the caprice of the power which\r\nhid the treasure. The wise and patient workman strikes his spade in\r\nhere, and with heavy toil can discover nothing but a poor quality of\r\nbarley, some potatoes and plentiful nettles, with a few dock leaves\r\nto cure his stings. The foolish spendthrift on the other side of the\r\nhedge, gazing idly at the sand glittering in the sun, suddenly realizes\r\nthat the earth is offering him gold--is dancing it before his listless\r\neyes lest it should escape him. Another man, searching for some more\r\nof this tempting gold, comes upon a great hoard of coal, or taps a jet\r\nof petroleum. Thus is Man mocked by Earth, his step-mother, and never\r\nknows as he tugs at her closed hand whether it contains diamonds or\r\nflints, good red wheat or a few clayey and blighted cabbages. Thus,\r\ntoo, he becomes a gambler, and scoffs at the theorists who prate of\r\nindustry and honesty and equality. Yet against this fate he eternally\r\nrebels. For since in gambling the many must lose in order that the few\r\nmay win; since dishonesty is mere shadow-grasping where every one is\r\ndishonest; and since inequality is bitter to all except the highest,\r\nand miserably lonely for him, men come greatly to desire that these\r\ncapricious gifts of Nature might be intercepted by some agency having\r\nthe power and the goodwill to distribute them justly according to the\r\nlabor done by each in the collective search for them. This desire is\r\nSocialism; and, as a means to its fulfilment, Socialists have devised\r\ncommunes, kingdoms, principalities, churches, manors, and finally,\r\nwhen all these had succumbed to the old gambling spirit, the Social\r\nDemocratic State, which yet remains to be tried. As against Socialism,\r\nthe gambling spirit urges man to allow no rival to come between his\r\nprivate individual powers and Step-mother Earth, but rather to secure\r\nsome acres of her and take his chance of getting diamonds instead of\r\ncabbages. This is Private Property, or Unsocialism. Our own choice\r\nis shewn by our continual aspiration to possess property, our common\r\nhailing of it as sacred, our setting apart of the word Respectable for\r\nthose who have attained it, our ascription of pre-eminent religiousness\r\nto commandments forbidding its violation, and our identification of law\r\nand order among men with its protection. Therefore is it vital to a\r\nliving knowledge of our society that Private Property should be known\r\nin every step of its progress from its source in cupidity to its end in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nLet us, in the manner of the Political Economist, trace the effects\r\nof settling a country by private property with undisturbed law and\r\norder. Figure to yourself the vast green plain of a country virgin\r\nto the spade, awaiting the advent of man. Imagine then the arrival\r\nof the first colonist, the original Adam, developed by centuries of\r\ncivilization into an Adam Smith, prospecting for an suitable patch of\r\nPrivate Property. Adam is, as Political Economy fundamentally assumes\r\nhim to be, “on the make”; therefore he drives his spade into, and sets\r\nup his stockade around, the most fertile and favorably situated patch\r\nhe can find. When he has tilled it, Political Economy inspired to\r\nprophesy by the spectacle, metaphorically exhibits Adam’s little patch\r\nof cultivation as a pool that will yet rise and submerge the whole\r\nland. Let us not forget this trope: it is the key to the ever-recurring\r\nphrase, “margin of cultivation,” in which, as may now be perceived,\r\nthere lurks a little unsuspected poetry. And truly the pool soon\r\nspreads. Other Adams come, all on the make, and therefore all sure to\r\npre-empt patches as near as may be to that of the first Adam’s, partly\r\nbecause he has chosen the best situation, partly for the pleasure of\r\nhis society and conversation, and partly because where two men are\r\nassembled together there is a two-man power that is far more than\r\ndouble one-man power, being indeed in some instances a quite new force,\r\ntotally destructive of the idiotic general hypothesis that society\r\nis no more than the sum of the units which compose it. These Adams,\r\ntoo, bring their Cains and Abels, who do not murder one another, but\r\nmerely pre-empt adjacent patches. And so the pool rises, and the margin\r\nspreads more and more remote from the centre, until the pool becomes a\r\nlake, and the lake an inland sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENT.\r\n\r\nBut in the course of this inundation the caprices of Nature begin to\r\noperate. That specially fertile region upon which Adam pitched is\r\nsooner or later all pre-empted; and there is nothing for the new-comer\r\nto pre-empt save soil of the second quality. Again, division of labor\r\nsets in among Adam’s neighbors; and with it, of course, comes the\r\nestablishment of a market for the exchange of the products of their\r\ndivided labor. Now it is not well to be far afield from that market,\r\nbecause distance from it involves extra cost for roads, beasts of\r\nburden, time consumed in travelling thither and back again. All this\r\nwill be saved to Adam at the centre of cultivation, and incurred\r\nby the new-comer at the margin of cultivation. Let us estimate the\r\nannual value of Adam’s produce at £1,000, and the annual produce of\r\nthe new-comer’s land on the margin of cultivation at £500, assuming\r\nthat Adam and the new-comer are equally industrious. Here is a clear\r\nadvantage of £500 a year to the first comer. This £500 is economic\r\nrent. It matters not at all that it is merely a difference of income,\r\nand not an overt payment from a tenant to a landlord. The two men labor\r\nequally; and yet one gets £500 a year more than the other through the\r\nsuperior fertility of his land and convenience of its situation. The\r\nexcess due to that fertility is rent; and before long we shall find it\r\nrecognized as such and paid in the fashion with which we are familiar.\r\nFor why should not Adam let his patch to the new-comer at a rent of\r\n£500 a year? Since the produce will be £1,000, the new-comer will have\r\n£500 left for himself, or as much as he could obtain by cultivating a\r\npatch of his own at the margin; and it is pleasanter, besides, to be\r\nin the centre of society than on the outskirts of it. The new-comer\r\nwill himself propose the arrangement; and Adam may retire as an idle\r\nlandlord with a perpetual pension of £500 rent. The excess of fertility\r\nin Adam’s land is thenceforth recognized as rent and paid, as it is\r\nto-day, regularly by a worker to a drone. A few samples of the way\r\nin which this simple and intelligible transaction is stated by our\r\neconomists may now, I hope, be quoted without any danger of their\r\nproving so difficult as they appear in the text-books from which I have\r\ncopied them.\r\n\r\nStuart Mill[2] says that “the rent of land consists of the excess\r\nof its return above the return to the worst land in cultivation.”\r\nFawcett[3] says that “the rent of land represents the pecuniary value\r\nof the advantages which such land possesses over the worst land in\r\ncultivation.” Professor Marshall[4] says that “the rent of a piece\r\nof land is the excess of its produce over the produce of an adjacent\r\npiece of land which would not be cultivated at all if rent were paid\r\nfor it.” Professor Sidgwick[5] cautiously puts it that “the normal\r\nrent _per acre_ of any piece” [of land] “is the surplus of the value\r\nof its produce over the value of the net produce per acre of the\r\nleast advantageous land that it is profitable to cultivate.” General\r\nWalker[6] declares that “specifically, the rent of any piece of land is\r\ndetermined by the difference between its annual yield and that of the\r\nleast productive land actually cultivated for the supply of the same\r\nmarket, it being assumed that the quality of the land as a productive\r\nagent is, in neither case, impaired or improved by such cultivation.”\r\nAll these definitions are offered by the authors as elaborations of\r\nthat given by their master Ricardo,[7] who says, “Rent is that portion\r\nof the produce of the earth which is paid to the landlord for the use\r\nof the original and indestructible powers of the soil.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY FAMILY.\r\n\r\nLet us return to our ideal country. Adam is retiring from productive\r\nindustry on £500 a year; and his neighbors are hastening to imitate\r\nhim as fresh tenants present themselves. The first result is the\r\nbeginning of a tradition that the oldest families in the country\r\nenjoy a superior position to the rest, and that the main advantage of\r\ntheir superior position is that they enjoy incomes without working.\r\nNevertheless, since they still depend on their tenants’ labor for their\r\nsubsistence, they continue to pay Labor, with a capital L, a certain\r\nmeed of mouth honor; and the resultant association of prosperity with\r\nidleness, and praise with industry, practically destroys morality by\r\nsetting up that incompatibility between conduct and principle which\r\nis the secret of the ingrained cynicism of our own time, and which\r\nproduces the curious Ricardian phenomenon of the man of business\r\nwho goes on Sunday to the church with the regularity of the village\r\nblacksmith, there to renounce and abjure before his God the line of\r\nconduct which he intends to pursue with all his might during the\r\nfollowing week.\r\n\r\nAccording to our hypothesis, the inland sea of cultivation has now\r\nspread into the wilderness so far that at its margin the return to\r\na man’s labor for a year is only £500. But as there is always a\r\nflood-tide in that sea, caused by the incessant increase of population,\r\nthe margin will not stop there; it will at last encroach upon every\r\nacre of cultivable land, rising to the snow line on the mountains and\r\nfalling to the coast of the actual salt water sea, but always reaching\r\nthe barrenest places last of all, because the cultivators are still,\r\nas ever, on the make, and will not break bad land when better is to be\r\nhad. But suppose that now, at last, the uttermost belt of free land is\r\nreached, and that upon it the yield to a man’s year’s labor is only\r\n£100. Clearly now the rent of Adam’s primeval patch has risen to £900,\r\nsince that is the excess of its produce over what is by this time all\r\nthat is to be had rent free. But Adam has yielded up his land for £500\r\na year to a tenant. It is this tenant accordingly who now lets Adam’s\r\npatch for £900 a year to the new-comer, who of course loses nothing\r\nby the bargain, since it leaves him the £100 a year with which he\r\nmust be content anyhow. Accordingly he labors on Adam’s land; raises\r\n£1,000 a year from it; keeps £100 and pays £900 to Adam’s tenant, who\r\npays £500 to Adam, keeping £400 for himself, and thus also becoming an\r\nidle gentleman, though with a somewhat smaller income than the man of\r\nolder family. It has, in fact, come to this, that the private property\r\nin Adam’s land is divided between three men, the first doing none of\r\nthe work and getting half the produce; the second doing none of the\r\nwork and getting two-fifths of the produce; and the third doing all\r\nthe work and getting only one-tenth of the produce. Incidentally also,\r\nthe moralist who is sure to have been prating somewhere about private\r\nproperty leading to the encouragement of industry, the establishment\r\nof a healthy incentive, and the distribution of wealth according to\r\nexertion, is exposed as a futile purblind person, starting _a priori_\r\nfrom blank ignorance, and proceeding deductively to mere contradiction\r\nand patent folly.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is a mere trifle compared to the sequel. When the\r\ninland sea has risen to its confines--when there is nothing but a strip\r\nof sand round the coast between the furrow and the wave--when the very\r\nwaves themselves are cultivated by fisherfolk--when the pastures and\r\ntimber forests have touched the snow line--when, in short, the land is\r\nall private property, yet every man is a proprietor, though it may be\r\nonly of a tenant right. He enjoys fixity of tenure at what is called\r\na fair rent; that is, he fares as well as he could on land wholly his\r\nown. All the rent is economic rent; the landlord cannot raise it nor\r\nthe tenant lower it; it is fixed naturally by the difference between\r\nthe fertility of the land for which it is paid and that of the worst\r\nland in the country. Compared with the world as we know it, such a\r\nstate of things is freedom and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROLETARIAT.\r\n\r\nBut at this point there appears in the land a man in a strange\r\nplight--one who wanders from snow line to sea coast in search of land,\r\nand finds none that is not the property of some one else. Private\r\nproperty had forgotten this man. On the roads he is a vagrant; off\r\nthem he is a trespasser; he is the first disinherited son of Adam,\r\nthe first proletarian, one in whose seed all the generations of the\r\nearth shall yet be blest, but who is himself for the present foodless,\r\nhomeless, shiftless, superfluous, and everything that turns a man into\r\na tramp or a thrall. Yet he is still a man with brain and muscle,\r\nable to devise and execute, able to deal puissantly with land if he\r\nonly could get access to it. But how to get that access! Necessity is\r\nthe mother of Invention. It may be that this second Adam, the first\r\nfather of the great proletariat, has one of those scarce brains which\r\nare not the least of Nature’s capricious gifts. If the fertile field\r\nyields rent, why not the fertile brain? Here is the first Adam’s patch\r\nstill yielding its £1,000 a year to the labor of the tenant who, as we\r\nhave seen, has to pay £900 away in rent. How if the proletarian were\r\nboldly to bid £1,000 a year to that man for the property? Apparently\r\nthe result would be the starvation of the proletarian, since he would\r\nhave to part with all the produce. But what if the proletarian can\r\ncontrive--invent--anticipate a new want--turn the land to some hitherto\r\nundreamt-of use--wrest £1,500 a year from the soil and site that\r\nonly yielded £1,000 before? If he can do this, he can pay the full\r\n£1,000 rent, and have an income of £500 left for himself. This is his\r\nprofit--the rent of his ability--the excess of its produce over that\r\nof ordinary stupidity. Here then is the opportunity of the cunning\r\nproletarian, the hero of that modern Plutarch, Mr. Samuel Smiles.\r\nTruly, as Napoleon said, the career is open to the talented. But alas!\r\nthe social question is no more a question of the fate of the talented\r\nthan of the idiotic. In due replenishment of the earth there comes\r\nanother proletarian who is no cleverer than other men, and can do as\r\nmuch, but not more than they. For him there is no rent of ability. How\r\nthen is he to get a tenant right? Let us see. It is certain that by\r\nthis time not only will the new devices of the renter of ability have\r\nbeen copied by people incapable of inventing them; but division of\r\nlabor, the use of tools and money, and the economies of civilization\r\nwill have greatly increased man’s power of extracting wealth from\r\nNature. All this increase will be so much gain to the holder of a\r\ntenant right, since his rent is a fixed payment out of the produce of\r\nhis holding, and the balance is his own. Therefore an addition to the\r\nproduce not foreseen by the landlord enriches the tenant. So that it\r\nmay well be that the produce of land on the margin of cultivation,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, fixes the produce left to the cultivators\r\nthroughout the whole area, may rise considerably. Suppose the yield to\r\nhave doubled; then our old friends who paid £900 rent, and kept £100\r\nfor themselves, have now, though they still pay £900 rent, £1,100 for\r\nthemselves, the total produce having risen to £2,000. Now here is an\r\nopportunity for our proletarian who is not clever. He can very well\r\noffer to cultivate the land subject to a payment of, for instance,\r\n£1,600 a year, leaving himself £400 a year. This will enable the last\r\nholder of the tenant right to retire as an idle gentleman receiving a\r\nnet income of £700 a year, and a gross income of £1,600, out of which\r\nhe pays £900 a year rent to a landlord who again pays to the head\r\nlandlord £500. But it is to be marked that this £700 a year net is\r\nnot economic rent. It is not the difference between the best and the\r\nworst land. It has nothing to do with the margin of cultivation. It is\r\na payment for the privilege of using land at all--for access to that\r\nwhich is now a close monopoly; and its amount is regulated, not by what\r\nthe purchaser could do for himself on land of his own at the margin,\r\nbut simply by the landholder’s eagerness to be idle on the one hand,\r\nand the proletarian’s need of subsistence on the other. In current\r\neconomic terms the price is regulated by supply and demand. As the\r\ndemand for land intensifies by the advent of fresh proletarians, the\r\nprice goes up; and the bargains are made more stringent. Tenant rights,\r\ninstead of being granted in perpetuity, and so securing for ever to\r\nthe tenant the increase due to unforeseen improvements in production,\r\nare granted on leases for finite terms, at the expiration of which the\r\nlandlord can revise the terms or eject the tenant. The payments rise\r\nuntil the original head rents and quit rents appear insignificant in\r\ncomparison with the incomes reaped by the intermediate tenant right\r\nholders or middlemen. Sooner or later the price of tenant right will\r\nrise so high that the actual cultivator will get no more of the produce\r\nthan suffices him for subsistence. At that point there is an end of\r\nsub-letting tenant rights. The land’s absorption of the proletarians as\r\ntenants paying more than the economic rent stops.\r\n\r\nAnd now what is the next proletarian to do? For all his forerunners we\r\nhave found a way of escape: for him there seems none. The board is at\r\nthe door, inscribed “Only standing room left”; and it might well bear\r\nthe more poetic legend, _Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch’ entrate_.\r\nThis man, born a proletarian, must die a proletarian, and leave his\r\ndestitution as an only inheritance to his son. It is not yet clear\r\nthat there is ten days’ life in him; for whence is his subsistence to\r\ncome if he cannot get at the land? Food he must have, and clothing;\r\nand both promptly. There is food in the market, and clothing also;\r\nbut not for nothing: hard money must be paid for it, and paid on the\r\nnail too; for he who has no property gets no credit. Money then\r\nis a necessity of life; and money can only be procured by selling\r\ncommodities. This presents no difficulty to the cultivators of the\r\nland, who can raise commodities by their labor; but the proletarian,\r\nbeing landless, has neither commodities nor means of producing them.\r\nSell something he must. Yet he has nothing to sell--except himself.\r\nThe idea seems a desperate one; but it proves quite easy to carry out.\r\nThe tenant cultivators of the land have not strength enough or time\r\nenough to exhaust the productive capacity of their holdings. If they\r\ncould buy men in the market for less than these men’s labor would add\r\nto the produce, then the purchase of such men would be a sheer gain.\r\nIt would indeed be only a purchase in form: the men would literally\r\ncost nothing, since they would produce their own price, with a surplus\r\nfor the buyer. Never in the history of buying and selling was there\r\nso splendid a bargain for buyers as this. Aladdin’s uncle’s offer of\r\nnew lamps for old ones, was in comparison a catch-penny. Accordingly,\r\nthe proletarian no sooner offers himself for sale than he finds a rush\r\nof bidders for him, each striving to get the better of the others by\r\noffering to give him more and more of the produce of his labor, and to\r\ncontent themselves with less and less surplus. But even the highest\r\nbidder must have some surplus, or he will not buy. The proletarian, in\r\naccepting the highest bid, sells himself openly into bondage. He is not\r\nthe first man who has done so; for it is evident that his forerunners,\r\nthe purchasers of tenant right, had been enslaved by the proprietors\r\nwho lived on the rents paid by them. But now all the disguise falls\r\noff; the proletarian renounces not only the fruit of his labor, but\r\nalso his right to think for himself and to direct his industry as he\r\npleases. The economic change is merely formal; the moral change is\r\nenormous. Soon the new direct traffic in men overspreads the whole\r\nmarket, and takes the place formerly held by the traffic in tenant\r\nrights. In order to understand the consequences, it is necessary to\r\nundertake an analysis of the exchange of commodities in general, since\r\nlabor power is now in the market on the same footing as any other ware\r\nexposed there for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCHANGE VALUE.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the custom of exchange will arise in the first\r\ninstance as soon as men give up providing each for his own needs by\r\nhis own labor. A man who makes his own tables and chairs, his own poker\r\nand kettle, his own bread and butter, and his own house and clothes,\r\nis jack-of-all-trades and master of none. He finds that he would get\r\non much faster if he stuck to making tables and chairs, and exchanged\r\nthem with the smith for a poker and kettle, with bakers and dairymen\r\nfor bread and butter, and with builders and tailors for a house and\r\nclothes. In doing this, he finds that his tables and chairs are worth\r\nso much--that they have an exchange value, as it is called. As a matter\r\nof general convenience, some suitable commodity is set up to measure\r\nthis value. We set up gold, which in this particular use of it, is\r\ncalled money. The chairmaker finds how much money his chairs are worth,\r\nand exchanges them for it. The blacksmith finds out how much money his\r\npokers are worth, and exchanges them for it. Thus, by employing money\r\nas a go-between, chairmakers can get pokers in exchange for their\r\nchairs, and blacksmiths chairs for their pokers. This is the mechanism\r\nof exchange; and once the values of the commodities are ascertained it\r\nworks simply enough. But it is a mere mechanism, and does not fix the\r\nvalues or explain them. And the attempt to discover what does fix them\r\nis beset with apparent contradictions which block up the right path,\r\nand with seductive coincidences which make the wrong seem the more\r\npromising.\r\n\r\nThe apparent contradictions soon shew themselves. It is evident that\r\nthe exchange value of anything depends on its utility, since no mortal\r\nexertion can make a useless thing exchangeable. And yet fresh air and\r\nsunlight, which are so useful as to be quite indispensable, have no\r\nexchange value; whilst a meteoric stone, shot free of charge from the\r\nfirmament into the back garden, has a considerable exchange value,\r\nalthough it is an eminently dispensable curiosity. We soon find that\r\nthis somehow depends on the fact that fresh air is plenty and meteoric\r\nstones scarce. If by any means the supply of fresh air could be\r\nsteadily diminished, and the supply of meteoric stones, by celestial\r\ncannonade or otherwise, steadily increased, the fresh air would\r\npresently acquire an exchange value which would gradually rise, whilst\r\nthe exchange value of meteoric stones would gradually fall, until at\r\nlast fresh air would be supplied through a meter and charged for like\r\ngas, and meteoric stones would be as unsaleable as ordinary pebbles.\r\nThe exchange value, in fact, decreases with the supply. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the supply decreases in utility as it goes on, because\r\nwhen people have had some of a commodity, they are partly satisfied,\r\nand do not value the rest so much. The usefulness of a pound of bread\r\nto a man depends on whether he has already eaten some. Every man wants\r\na certain number of pounds of bread per week, no man wants much more;\r\nand if more is offered he will not give much for it--perhaps not\r\nanything. One umbrella is very useful: a second umbrella is a luxury:\r\na third is mere lumber. Similarly, the curators of our museums want a\r\nmoderate collection of meteoric stones; but they do not want a cartload\r\napiece of them. Now the exchange value is fixed by the utility, not of\r\nthe most useful, but of the least useful part of the stock. Why this\r\nis so can readily be made obvious by an illustration. If the stock of\r\numbrellas in the market were sufficiently large to provide two for each\r\numbrella carrier in the community, then, since a second umbrella is\r\nnot so useful as the first, the doctrinaire course would be to ticket\r\nhalf the umbrellas at, say, fifteen shillings, and the other half at\r\neight and sixpence. Unfortunately, no man will give fifteen shillings\r\nfor an article which he can get for eight and sixpence; and when the\r\npublic came to buy, they would buy up all the eight and sixpenny\r\numbrellas. Each person being thus supplied with an umbrella, the\r\nremainder of the stock, though marked fifteen shillings, would be in\r\nthe position of second umbrellas, only worth eight and sixpence. This\r\nis how the exchange value of the least useful part of the supply fixes\r\nthe exchange value of all the rest. Technically, it occurs by “the law\r\nof indifference.” And since the least useful unit of the supply is\r\ngenerally that which is last produced, its utility is called the final\r\nutility of the commodity. The utility of the first or most useful unit\r\nis called the total utility of the commodity. If there were but one\r\numbrella in the world, the exchange value of its total utility would be\r\nwhat the most delicate person would pay for it on a very wet day sooner\r\nthan go without it. But practically, thanks to the law of indifference,\r\nthe most delicate person pays no more than the most robust: that\r\nis, both pay alike the exchange value of the utility of the last\r\numbrella produced--or of the final utility of the whole stock of\r\numbrellas. These terms--law of indifference, total utility, and final\r\nutility--though admirably expressive and intelligible when you know\r\nbeforehand exactly what they mean, are, taken by themselves, failures\r\nin point of lucidity and suggestiveness. Some economists, transferring\r\nfrom cultivation to utility our old metaphor of the spreading pool,\r\ncall final utility “marginal utility.” Either will serve our present\r\npurpose, as I do not intend to use the terms again. The main point to\r\nbe grasped is, that however useful any commodity may be, its exchange\r\nvalue can be run down to nothing by increasing the supply until there\r\nis more of it than is wanted. The excess, being useless and valueless,\r\nis to be had for nothing; and nobody will pay anything for a commodity\r\nas long as plenty of it is to be had for nothing. This is why air\r\nand other indispensable things have no exchange value, whilst scarce\r\ngewgaws fetch immense prices.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the conditions which confront man as a producer and\r\nexchanger. If he produces a useless thing, his labor will be wholly\r\nin vain: he will get nothing for it. If he produces a useful thing,\r\nthe price he will get for it will depend on how much of it there is\r\nfor sale already. If he increases the supply by producing more than is\r\nsufficient to replace the current consumption, he inevitably lowers the\r\nvalue of the whole. It therefore behooves him to be wary in choosing\r\nhis occupation, as well as industrious in pursuing it. His choice will\r\nnaturally fall on the production of those commodities whose value\r\nstands highest relatively to the labor required to produce them--which\r\nfetch the highest price in proportion to their cost, in fact. Suppose,\r\nfor example, that a maker of musical instruments found that it cost him\r\nexactly as much to make a harp as to make a pianoforte, but that harps\r\nwere going out of fashion and pianofortes coming in. Soon there would\r\nbe more harps than were wanted, and fewer pianofortes: consequently\r\nthe value of harps would fall, and that of pianofortes rise. Since\r\nthe labor cost of both would be the same, he would immediately devote\r\nall his labor to pianoforte-making; and other manufacturers would\r\ndo the same, until the increase of supply brought down the value of\r\npianofortes to the value of harps. Possibly fashion then might veer\r\nfrom pianofortes to American organs, in which case he would make less\r\npianofortes and more American organs. When these, too, had increased\r\nsufficiently, the exertions of the Salvation Army might create such a\r\ndemand for tambourines as to make them worth four times their cost of\r\nproduction, whereupon there would instantly be a furious concentration\r\nof the instrument-making energy on the manufacture of tambourines; and\r\nthis concentration would last until the supply had brought down the\r\nprofit[8] to less than might be gained by gratifying the public craving\r\nfor trombones. At last, as pianofortes were cheapened until they were\r\nno more profitable than harps; then American organs until they were no\r\nmore profitable than pianos; and then tambourines until they were level\r\nwith American organs; so eventually trombones will pay no better than\r\ntambourines; and a general level of profit will be attained, indicating\r\nthe proportion in which the instruments are wanted by the public. But\r\nto skim off even this level of profit, more of the instruments may be\r\nproduced in the ascertained proportion until their prices fall to their\r\ncosts of production, when there will be no profit. Here the production\r\nwill be decisively checked, since a further supply would cause only\r\na loss; and men can lose money, without the trouble of producing\r\ncommodities, by the simple process of throwing it out of a window.\r\n\r\nWhat occurred with the musical instruments in this illustration occurs\r\nin practice with the whole mass of manufactured commodities. Those\r\nwhich are scarce, and therefore relatively high in value, tempt us to\r\nproduce them until the increase of the supply reduces their value to\r\na point at which there is no more profit to be made out of them than\r\nout of other commodities. The general level of profit thus attained is\r\nfurther exploited until the general increase brings down the price of\r\nall commodities to their cost of production, the equivalent of which\r\nis sometimes called their normal value. And here a glance back to our\r\nanalysis of the spread of cultivation, and its result in the phenomenon\r\nof rent, suggests the question What does the cost of production of\r\na commodity mean? We have seen that, owing to the differences in\r\nfertility and advantage of situation between one piece of land and\r\nanother, cost of production varies from district to district, being\r\nhighest at the margin of cultivation. But we have also seen how the\r\nlandlord skims off as economic rent all the advantages gained by the\r\ncultivators of superior soils and sites. Consequently, the addition\r\nof the landlord’s rent to the expenses of production brings them up\r\neven on the best land to the level of those incurred on the worst.\r\nCost of production, then, means cost of production on the margin of\r\ncultivation, and is equalized to all producers, since what they may\r\nsave in labor per commodity is counterbalanced by the greater mass of\r\ncommodities they must produce in order to bring in the rent. It is\r\nonly by a thorough grasp of this levelling-down action that we can\r\ndetect the trick by which the ordinary economist tries to cheat us into\r\naccepting the private property system as practically just. He first\r\nshews that economic rent does not enter into cost of production on the\r\nmargin of cultivation. Then he shews that the cost of production on the\r\nmargin of cultivation determines the price of a commodity. Therefore,\r\nhe argues, first, that rent does not enter into price; and second, that\r\nthe value of commodities is fixed by their cost of production, the\r\nimplication being that the landlords cost the community nothing, and\r\nthat commodities exchange in exact proportion to the labor they cost.\r\nThis trivially ingenious way of being disingenuous is officially taught\r\nas political economy in our schools to this day. It will be seen at\r\nonce that it is mere thimblerig. So far from commodities exchanging,\r\nor tending to exchange, according to the labor expended in their\r\nproduction, commodities produced well within the margin of cultivation\r\nwill fetch as high a price as commodities produced at the margin with\r\nmuch greater labor. So far from the landlord costing nothing, he costs\r\nall the difference between the two.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the goal of our analysis of value. We now see\r\nhow Man’s control over the value of commodities consists solely in his\r\npower of regulating their supply. Individuals are constantly trying to\r\ndecrease supply for their own advantage. Gigantic conspiracies have\r\nbeen entered into to forestall the world’s wheat and cotton harvests,\r\nso as to force their value to the highest possible point. Cargoes of\r\nEast Indian spices have been destroyed by the Dutch as cargoes of\r\nfish are now destroyed in the Thames, to maintain prices by limiting\r\nsupply. All rings, trusts, corners, combinations, monopolies and trade\r\nsecrets have the same object. Production and the development of the\r\nsocial instincts are alike hindered by each man’s consciousness that\r\nthe more he stints the community the more he benefits himself, the\r\njustification, of course, being that when every man has benefited\r\nhimself at the expense of the community, the community will benefit by\r\nevery man in it being benefited. From one thing the community is safe.\r\nThere will be no permanent conspiracies to reduce values by increasing\r\nsupply. All men will cease producing when the value of their product\r\nfalls below its cost of production, whether in labor or in labor _plus_\r\nrent. No man will keep on producing bread until it will fetch nothing,\r\nlike the sunlight, or until it becomes a nuisance, like the rain in\r\nthe summer of 1888. So far, our minds are at ease as to the excessive\r\nincrease of commodities voluntarily produced by the labor of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGES.\r\n\r\nI now ask you to pick up the dropped subject of the spread of\r\ncultivation. We had got as far as the appearance in the market of\r\na new commodity--of the proletarian man compelled to live by the\r\nsale of himself! In order to realize at once the latent horror of\r\nthis, you have only to apply our investigation of value, with its\r\ninevitable law that only by restricting the supply of a commodity\r\ncan its value be kept from descending finally to zero. The commodity\r\nwhich the proletarian sells is one over the production of which he\r\nhas practically no control. He is himself driven to produce it by an\r\nirresistible impulse. It was the increase of population that spread\r\ncultivation and civilization from the centre to the snowline, and at\r\nlast forced men to sell themselves to the lords of the soil: it is the\r\nsame force that continues to multiply men so that their exchange falls\r\nslowly and surely until it disappears altogether--until even black\r\nchattel slaves are released as not worth keeping in a land where men\r\nof all colors are to be had for nothing. This is the condition of our\r\nEnglish laborers to-day: they are no longer even dirt cheap: they are\r\nvalueless, and can be had for nothing. The proof is the existence of\r\nthe unemployed, who can find no purchasers. By the law of indifference,\r\nnobody will buy men at a price when he can obtain equally serviceable\r\nmen for nothing. What, then, is the explanation of the wages given to\r\nthose who are in employment, and who certainly do not work for nothing?\r\nThe matter is deplorably simple. Suppose that horses multiplied in\r\nEngland in such quantities that they were to be had for the asking,\r\nlike kittens condemned to the bucket. You would still have to feed\r\nyour horse--feed him and lodge him well if you used him as a smart\r\nhunter--feed him and lodge him wretchedly if you used him only as a\r\ndrudge. But the cost of keeping would not mean that the horse had an\r\nexchange value. If you got him for nothing in the first instance--if\r\nno one would give you anything for him when you were done with him,\r\nhe would be worth nothing, in spite of the cost of his keep. That is\r\njust the case of every member of the proletariat who could be replaced\r\nby one of the unemployed to-day. Their wage is not the price of\r\nthemselves; for they are worth nothing: it is only their keep. For bare\r\nsubsistence wages you can get as much common labor as you want, and do\r\nwhat you please with it within the limits of a criminal code which is\r\nsure to be interpreted by a proprietary-class judge in your favor. If\r\nyou have to give your footman a better allowance than your wretched\r\nhewer of match wood, it is for the same reason that you have to give\r\nyour hunter beans and a clean stall instead of chopped straw and a\r\nsty.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITALISM.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the acquisition of labor becomes a mere question of\r\nprovender. If a railway is required, all that is necessary is to\r\nprovide subsistence for a sufficient number of laborers to construct\r\nit. If, for example, the railway requires the labor of a thousand\r\nmen for five years, the cost to the proprietors of the site is the\r\nsubsistence of a thousand men for five years. This subsistence is\r\ntechnically called capital. It is provided for by the proprietors not\r\nconsuming the whole excess over wages of the produce of the labor of\r\ntheir other wage workers, but setting aside enough for the subsistence\r\nof the railway makers. In this way capital can claim to be the result\r\nof saving, or, as one ingenious apologist neatly put it, the reward of\r\nabstinence, a gleam of humor which still enlivens treatises on capital.\r\nThe savers, it need hardly be said, are those who have more money than\r\nthey want to spend: the abstainers are those who have less. At the\r\nend of the five years, the completed railway is the property of the\r\ncapitalists; and the railway makers fall back into the labor market\r\nas helpless as they were before. Sometimes the proprietors call the\r\ncompleted railway their capital; but, strictly, this is only a figure\r\nof speech. Capital is simply spare subsistence. Its market value,\r\nindicated by the current rate of interest, falls with the increase of\r\npopulation, whereas the market value of established stock rises with\r\nit.[10] If Mr. Goschen, encouraged by his success in reducing Consols,\r\nwere to ask the proprietors of the London and North Western Railway to\r\naccept as full compensation for their complete expropriation capital\r\njust sufficient to make the railway anew, their amazement at his\r\naudacity would at once make him feel the difference between a railway\r\nand capital. Colloquially, one property with a farm on it is said to\r\nbe land yielding rent; whilst another, with a railway on it, is called\r\ncapital yielding interest. But economically there is no distinction\r\nbetween them when they once become sources of revenue. This would\r\nbe quite clearly seen if costly enterprises like railways could be\r\nundertaken by a single landlord on his own land out of his own surplus\r\nwealth. It is the necessity of combining a number of possessors of\r\nsurplus wealth, and devising a financial machinery for apportioning\r\ntheir shares in the produce to their shares in the capital contributed,\r\nthat modifies the terminology and external aspect of the exploitation.\r\nBut the modification is not an alteration: shareholder and landlord\r\nlive alike on the produce extracted from their property by the labor of\r\nthe proletariat.\r\n\r\n\r\n“OVERPOPULATION.”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the capitalistic system is a sign that the\r\nexploitation of the laborer toiling for a bare subsistence wage has\r\nbecome one of the chief arts of life among the holders of tenant\r\nrights. It also produces a delusive promise of endless employment\r\nwhich blinds the proletariat to those disastrous consequences of rapid\r\nmultiplication which are obvious to the small cultivator and peasant\r\nproprietor. But indeed the more you degrade the workers, robbing them\r\nof all artistic enjoyment, and all chance of respect and admiration\r\nfrom their fellows, the more you throw them back, reckless, on the\r\none pleasure and the one human tie left to them--the gratification of\r\ntheir instinct for producing fresh supplies of men. You will applaud\r\nthis instinct as divine until at last the excessive supply becomes\r\na nuisance: there comes a plague of men; and you suddenly discover\r\nthat the instinct is diabolic, and set up a cry of “overpopulation.”\r\nBut your slaves are beyond caring for your cries; they breed like\r\nrabbits; and their poverty breeds filth, ugliness, dishonesty, disease,\r\nobscenity, drunkenness, and murder. In the midst of the riches which\r\ntheir labor piles up for you, their misery rises up too and stifles\r\nyou. You withdraw in disgust to the other end of the town from them;\r\nyou appoint special carriages on your railways and special seats in\r\nyour churches and theatres for them; you set your life apart from\r\ntheirs by every class barrier you can devise; and yet they swarm about\r\nyou still: your face gets stamped with your habitual loathing and\r\nsuspicion of them; your ears get so filled with the language of the\r\nvilest of them that you break into it when you lose your self-control;\r\nthey poison your life as remorselessly as you have sacrificed theirs\r\nheartlessly. You begin to believe intensely in the devil. Then comes\r\nthe terror of their revolting; the drilling and arming of bodies of\r\nthem to keep down the rest; the prison, the hospital, paroxysms of\r\nfrantic coercion, followed by paroxysms of frantic charity. And in the\r\nmeantime, the population continues to increase!\r\n\r\n\r\n“ILLTH.”\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that during this grotesquely hideous march of\r\ncivilization from bad to worse, wealth is increasing side by side\r\nwith misery. Such a thing is eternally impossible; wealth is steadily\r\ndecreasing with the spread of poverty. But riches are increasing, which\r\nis quite another thing. The total of the exchange values produced in\r\nthe country annually is mounting perhaps by leaps and bounds. But the\r\naccumulation of riches, and consequently of an excessive purchasing\r\npower, in the hands of a class, soon satiates that class with socially\r\nuseful wealth, and sets them offering a price for luxuries. The moment\r\na price is to be had for a luxury, it acquires exchange value, and\r\nlabor is employed to produce it. A New York lady, for instance, having\r\na nature of exquisite sensibility, orders an elegant rosewood and\r\nsilver coffin, upholstered in pink satin, for her dead dog. It is made;\r\nand meanwhile a live child is prowling barefooted and hunger-stunted in\r\nthe frozen gutter outside. The exchange-value of the coffin is counted\r\nas part of the national wealth; but a nation which cannot afford food\r\nand clothing for its children cannot be allowed to pass as wealthy\r\nbecause it has provided a pretty coffin for a dead dog. Exchange value\r\nitself, in fact, has become bedevilled like everything else, and\r\nrepresents, no longer utility, but the cravings of lust, folly, vanity,\r\ngluttony, and madness, technically described by genteel economists as\r\n“effective demand.” Luxuries are not social wealth; the machinery for\r\nproducing them is not social wealth; labor skilled only to manufacture\r\nthem is not socially useful labor; the men, women, and children who\r\nmake a living by producing them are no more self-supporting than\r\nthe idle rich for whose amusement they are kept at work. It is the\r\nhabit of counting as wealth the exchange values involved in these\r\ntransactions that makes us fancy that the poor are starving in the\r\nmidst of plenty. They are starving in the midst of plenty of jewels,\r\nvelvets, laces, equipages, and race-horses; but not in the midst of\r\nplenty of food. In the things that are wanted for the welfare of the\r\npeople we are abjectly poor; and England’s social policy to-day may be\r\nlikened to the domestic policy of those adventuresses who leave their\r\nchildren half-clothed and half-fed in order to keep a carriage and\r\ndeal with a fashionable dressmaker. But it is quite true that whilst\r\nwealth and welfare are decreasing, productive power is increasing; and\r\nnothing but the perversion of this power to the production of socially\r\nuseless commodities prevents the apparent wealth from becoming real.\r\nThe purchasing power that commands luxuries in the hands of the rich,\r\nwould command true wealth in the hands of all. Yet private property\r\nmust still heap the purchasing power upon the few rich and withdraw it\r\nfrom the many poor. So that, in the end, the subject of the one boast\r\nthat private property can make--the great accumulation of so-called\r\n“wealth” which it points so proudly to as the result of its power to\r\nscourge men and women daily to prolonged and intense toil, turns out\r\nto be a simulacrum. With all its energy, its Smilesian “self-help,”\r\nits merchant-princely enterprise, its ferocious sweating and\r\nslave-driving, its prodigality of blood, sweat and tears, what has it\r\nheaped up, over and above the pittance of its slaves? Only a monstrous\r\npile of frippery, some tainted class literature and class art, and not\r\na little poison and mischief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the economic analysis which convicts Private Property of\r\nbeing unjust even from the beginning, and utterly impossible as a final\r\nsolution of even the individualist aspect of the problem of adjusting\r\nthe share of the worker in the distribution of wealth to the labor\r\nincurred by him in its production. All attempts yet made to construct\r\ntrue societies upon it have failed; the nearest things to societies so\r\nachieved have been civilizations, which have rotted into centres of\r\nvice and luxury, and eventually been swept away by uncivilized races.\r\nThat our own civilization is already in an advanced stage of rottenness\r\nmay be taken as statistically proved. That further decay instead of\r\nimprovement must ensue if the institution of private property be\r\nmaintained, is economically certain. Fortunately, private property\r\nin its integrity is not now practicable. Although the safety-valve\r\nof emigration has been furiously at work during this century, yet\r\nthe pressure of population has forced us to begin the restitution\r\nto the people of the sums taken from them for the ground landlords,\r\nholders of tenant right, and capitalists, by the imposition of an\r\nincome tax, and by compelling them to establish out of their revenues\r\na national system of education, besides imposing restrictions--as yet\r\nonly of the forcible-feeble sort--on their terrible power of abusing\r\nthe wage contract. These, however, are dealt with by Mr. Sidney Webb\r\nin the historic essay which follows. I should not touch upon them at\r\nall, were it not that experience has lately convinced all economists\r\nthat no exercise in abstract economics, however closely deduced, is\r\nto be trusted unless it can be experimentally verified by tracing\r\nits expression in history. It is true that the process which I have\r\npresented as a direct development of private property between free\r\nexchangers had to work itself out in the Old World indirectly and\r\ntortuously through a struggle with political and religious institutions\r\nand survivals quite antagonistic to it. It is true that cultivation\r\ndid not begin in Western Europe with the solitary emigrant pre-empting\r\nhis private property, but with the tribal communes in which arose\r\nsubsequently the assertion of the right of the individual to private\r\njudgment and private action against the tyranny of primitive society.\r\nIt is true that cultivation has not proceeded by logical steps from\r\ngood land to less good; from less good to bad; and from bad to worse:\r\nthe exploration of new countries and new regions, and the discovery of\r\nnew uses for old products, has often made the margin of cultivation\r\nmore fruitful than the centre, and, for the moment (whilst the centre\r\nwas shifting to the margin), turned the whole movement of rent and\r\nwages directly counter to the economic theory. Nor is it true that,\r\ntaking the world as one country, cultivation has yet spread from the\r\nsnowline to the water’s edge. There is free land still for the poorest\r\nEast End match-box maker if she could get there, reclaim the wilderness\r\nthere, speak the language there, stand the climate there, and be\r\nfed, clothed, and housed there whilst she cleared her farm; learned\r\nhow to cultivate it; and waited for the harvest. Economists have\r\nbeen ingenious enough to prove that this alternative really secures\r\nher independence; but I shall not waste time in dealing with that.\r\nPractically, if there is no free land in England, the economic analysis\r\nholds good of England, in spite of Siberia, Central Africa, and the\r\nWild West. Again, it is not immediately true that men are governed in\r\nproduction solely by a determination to realize the maximum of exchange\r\nvalue. The impulse to production often takes specific direction in the\r\nfirst instance; and a man will insist on producing pictures or plays\r\nalthough he might gain more money by producing boots or bonnets. But,\r\nhis specific impulse once gratified, he will make as much money as he\r\ncan. He will sell his picture or play for a hundred pounds rather than\r\nfor fifty. In short, though there is no such person as the celebrated\r\n“economic man,” man being wilful rather than rational, yet when the\r\nwilful man has had his way he will take what else he can get; and so\r\nhe always does appear, finally if not primarily, as the economic man.\r\nOn the whole, history, even in the Old World, goes the way traced\r\nby the economist. In the New World the correspondence is exact. The\r\nUnited States and the Colonies have been peopled by fugitives from\r\nthe full-blown individualism of Western Europe, pre-empting private\r\nproperty precisely as assumed in this investigation of the conditions\r\nof cultivation. The economic relations of these cultivators have not\r\nsince put on any of the old political disguises. Yet among them, in\r\nconfirmation of the validity of our analysis, we see all the evils of\r\nour old civilizations growing up; and though with them the end is not\r\nyet, still it is from them to us that the great recent revival of the\r\ncry for nationalization of the land has come, articulated by a man who\r\nhad seen the whole tragedy of private property hurried through its acts\r\nwith unprecedented speed in the mushroom cities of America.\r\n\r\nOn Socialism the analysis of the economic action of Individualism\r\nbears as a discovery, in the private appropriation of land, of the\r\nsource of those unjust privileges against which Socialism is aimed.\r\nIt is practically a demonstration that public property in land is the\r\nbasic economic condition of Socialism. But this does not involve at\r\npresent a literal restoration of the land to the people. The land is\r\nat present in the hands of the people: its proprietors are for the\r\nmost part absentees. The modern form of private property is simply a\r\nlegal claim to take a share of the produce of the national industry\r\nyear by year without working for it. It refers to no special part\r\nor form of that produce; and in process of consumption its revenue\r\ncannot be distinguished from earnings, so that the majority of\r\npersons, accustomed to call the commodities which form the income\r\nof the proprietor his private property, and seeing no difference\r\nbetween them and the commodities which form the income of a worker,\r\nextend the term private property to the worker’s subsistence also,\r\nand can only conceive an attack on private property as an attempt to\r\nempower everybody to rob everybody else all round. But the income of a\r\nprivate proprietor can be distinguished by the fact that he obtains it\r\nunconditionally and gratuitously by private right against the public\r\nweal, which is incompatible with the existence of consumers who do not\r\nproduce. Socialism involves discontinuance of the payment of these\r\nincomes, and addition of the wealth so saved to incomes derived from\r\nlabor. As we have seen, incomes derived from private property consist\r\npartly of economic rent; partly of pensions, also called rent, obtained\r\nby the sub-letting of tenant rights; and partly of a form of rent\r\ncalled interest, obtained by special adaptations of land to production\r\nby the application of capital: all these being finally paid out of the\r\ndifference between the produce of the worker’s labor and the price\r\nof that labor sold in the open market for wages, salary, fees, or\r\nprofits.[11] The whole, except economic rent, can be added directly to\r\nthe incomes of the workers by simply discontinuing its exaction from\r\nthem. Economic rent, arising as it does from variations of fertility\r\nor advantages of situation, must always be held as common or social\r\nwealth, and used, as the revenues raised by taxation are now used, for\r\npublic purposes, among which Socialism would make national insurance\r\nand the provision of capital matters of the first importance.\r\n\r\nThe economic problem of Socialism is thus solved; and the political\r\nquestion of how the economic solution is to be practically applied\r\ndoes not come within the scope of this essay. But if we have got\r\nas far as an intellectual conviction that the source of our social\r\nmisery is no eternal well-spring of confusion and evil, but only an\r\nartificial system susceptible of almost infinite modification and\r\nreadjustment--nay, of practical demolition and substitution at the will\r\nof Man, then a terrible weight will be lifted from the minds of all\r\nexcept those who are, whether avowedly to themselves or not, clinging\r\nto the present state of things from base motives. We have had in this\r\ncentury a stern series of lessons on the folly of believing anything\r\nfor no better reason than that it is pleasant to believe it. It was\r\npleasant to look round with a consciousness of possessing a thousand\r\na year, and say, with Browning’s David, “All’s love; and all’s law.”\r\nIt was pleasant to believe that the chance we were too lazy to take in\r\nthis world would come back to us in another. It was pleasant to believe\r\nthat a benevolent hand was guiding the steps of society; overruling\r\nall evil appearances for good; and making poverty here the earnest of\r\na great blessedness and reward hereafter. It was pleasant to lose the\r\nsense of worldly inequality in the contemplation of our equality before\r\nGod. But utilitarian questioning and scientific answering turned all\r\nthis tranquil optimism into the blackest pessimism. Nature was shewn\r\nto us as “red in tooth and claw”: if the guiding hand were indeed\r\nbenevolent, then it could not be omnipotent; so that our trust in it\r\nwas broken: if it were omnipotent, it could not be benevolent; so that\r\nour love of it turned to fear and hatred. We had never admitted that\r\nthe other world, which was to compensate for the sorrows of this, was\r\nopen to horses and apes (though we had not on that account been any\r\nthe more merciful to our horses); and now came Science to shew us the\r\ncorner of the pointed ear of the horse on our own heads, and present\r\nthe ape to us as our blood relation. No proof came of the existence of\r\nthat other world and that benevolent power to which we had left the\r\nremedy of the atrocious wrongs of the poor; proof after proof came\r\nthat what we called Nature knew and cared no more about our pains\r\nand pleasures than we know or care about the tiny creatures we crush\r\nunderfoot as we walk through the fields. Instead of at once perceiving\r\nthat this meant no more than that Nature was unmoral and indifferent,\r\nwe relapsed into a gross form of devil worship, and conceived Nature\r\nas a remorselessly malignant power. This was no better than the old\r\noptimism, and infinitely gloomier. It kept our eyes still shut to the\r\ntruth that there is no cruelty and selfishness outside Man himself;\r\nand that his own active benevolence can combat and vanquish both. When\r\nthe Socialist came forward as a meliorist on these lines, the old\r\nschool of political economists, who could see no alternative to private\r\nproperty, put forward in proof of the powerlessness of benevolent\r\naction to arrest the deadly automatic production of poverty by the\r\nincrease of population, the very analysis I have just presented. Their\r\nconclusions exactly fitted in with the new ideas. It was Nature at\r\nit again--the struggle for existence--the remorseless extirpation of\r\nthe weak--the survival of the fittest--in short, natural selection\r\nat work. Socialism seemed too good to be true: it was passed by as\r\nmerely the old optimism foolishly running its head against the stone\r\nwall of modern science. But Socialism now challenges individualism,\r\nscepticism, pessimism, worship of Nature personified as a devil,\r\non their own ground of science. The science of the production and\r\ndistribution of wealth is Political Economy. Socialism appeals to\r\nthat science, and, turning on Individualism its own guns, routs it\r\nin incurable disaster. Henceforth the bitter cynic who still finds\r\nthe world an eternal and unimprovable doghole, with the placid person\r\nof means who repeats the familiar misquotation, “The poor ye shall\r\nhave always with you,” lose their usurped place among the cultured,\r\nand pass over to the ranks of the ignorant, the shallow, and the\r\nsuperstitious. As for the rest of us, since we were taught to revere\r\nproprietary respectability in our unfortunate childhood, and since we\r\nfound our childish hearts so hard and unregenerate that they secretly\r\nhated and rebelled against respectability in spite of that teaching,\r\nit is impossible to express the relief with which we discover that\r\nour hearts were all along right, and that the current respectability\r\nof to-day is nothing but a huge inversion of righteous and scientific\r\nsocial order weltering in dishonesty, uselessness, selfishness, wanton\r\nmisery, and idiotic waste of magnificent opportunities for noble and\r\nhappy living. It was terrible to feel this, and yet to fear that it\r\ncould not be helped--that the poor must starve and make you ashamed\r\nof your dinner--that they must shiver and make you ashamed of your\r\nwarm overcoat. It is to economic science--once the Dismal, now the\r\nHopeful--that we are indebted for the discovery that though the evil\r\nis enormously worse than we knew, yet it is not eternal--not even very\r\nlong lived, if we only bestir ourselves to make an end of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] “Principles of Political Economy,” Vol. I, Index to chap. xvi\r\n(1865).\r\n\r\n[3] “Manual of Political Economy,” Book II, chap. iii, p. 116 (1876).\r\n\r\n[4] “Economics of Industry,” Book II, chap. iii, sec. 3, p. 84 (1879).\r\n\r\n[5] “Principles of Political Economy,” Book II, chap. vii, p. 301\r\n(1883).\r\n\r\n[6] “Brief Text-book of Political Economy,” chap. ii, sec. 216, p. 173\r\n(1885).\r\n\r\n[7] “Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,” chap. ii. p. 34\r\n(1817).\r\n\r\n[8] Profit is here used colloquially to denote the excess of the value\r\nof an article over its cost.\r\n\r\n[9] When one of the conditions of earning a wage is the keeping up\r\nof a certain state, subsistence wages may reach a figure to which\r\nthe term seems ludicrously inappropriate.

Just as every human\r\nbeing has an ancestry, unknown to him though it may be; so every idea,\r\nevery incident, every movement has in the past its own long chain of\r\ncauses, without which it could not have been. Formerly we were glad to\r\nlet the dead bury their dead: nowadays we turn lovingly to the records,\r\nwhether of persons or things; and we busy ourselves willingly among\r\norigins, even without conscious utilitarian end. We are no longer\r\nproud of having ancestors, since every one has them; but we are more\r\nthan ever interested in our ancestors, now that we find in them the\r\nfragments which compose our very selves. The historic ancestry of the\r\nEnglish social organization during the present century stands witness\r\nto the irresistible momentum of the ideas which Socialism denotes. The\r\nrecord of the century in English social history begins with the trial\r\nand hopeless failure of an almost complete industrial individualism,\r\nin which, however, unrestrained private ownership of land and capital\r\nwas accompanied by subjection to a political oligarchy. So little\r\nelement of permanence was there in this individualistic order that,\r\nwith the progress of political emancipation, private ownership of the\r\nmeans of production has been, in one direction or another, successively\r\nregulated, limited and superseded, until it may now fairly be claimed\r\nthat the Socialist philosophy of to-day is but the conscious and\r\nexplicit assertion of principles of social organization which have been\r\nalready in great part unconsciously adopted. The economic history\r\nof the century is an almost continuous record of the progress of\r\nSocialism.[12]\r\n\r\nSocialism, too, has in the record of its internal development a history\r\nof its own. Down to the present generation, the aspirant after social\r\nregeneration naturally vindicated the practicability of his ideas by\r\noffering an elaborate plan with specifications of a new social order\r\nfrom which all contemporary evils were eliminated. Just as Plato had\r\nhis Republic and Sir Thomas More his Utopia, so Babœuf had his Charter\r\nof Equality, Cabet his Icaria, St. Simon his Industrial System, and\r\nFourier his ideal Phalanstery. Robert Owen spent a fortune in pressing\r\nupon an unbelieving generation his New Moral World; and even Auguste\r\nComte, superior as he was to many of the weaknesses of his time, must\r\nneeds add a detailed Polity to his Philosophy of Positivism.\r\n\r\nThe leading feature of all these proposals was what may be called their\r\nstatical character. The ideal society was represented as in perfectly\r\nbalanced equilibrium, without need or possibility of future organic\r\nalteration. Since their day we have learned that social reconstruction\r\nmust not be gone at in this fashion. Owing mainly to the efforts of\r\nComte, Darwin and Herbert Spencer, we can no longer think of the\r\nideal society as an unchanging state. The social ideal, from being\r\nstatic, has become dynamic. The necessity of the constant growth and\r\ndevelopment of the social organism has become axiomatic. No philosopher\r\nnow looks for anything but the gradual evolution of the new order\r\nfrom the old, without breach of continuity or abrupt change of the\r\nentire social tissue at any point during the process. The new becomes\r\nitself old, often before it is consciously recognized as new; and\r\nhistory shews us no example of the sudden substitutions of Utopian and\r\nrevolutionary romance.\r\n\r\nThough Socialists have learnt this lesson[13] better than most of\r\ntheir opponents, the common criticism of Socialism has not yet noted\r\nthe change, and still deals mainly with the obsolete Utopias of the\r\npre-evolutionary age. Parodies of the domestic details of an imaginary\r\nPhalanstery, and homilies on the failure of Brook Farm or Icaria, may\r\nbe passed over as belated and irrelevant now that Socialists are only\r\nadvocating the conscious adoption of a principle of social organization\r\nwhich the world has already found to be the inevitable outcome of\r\nDemocracy and the Industrial Revolution. For Socialism is by this time\r\na wave surging throughout all Europe; and for want of a grasp of the\r\nseries of apparently unconnected events by which and with which it has\r\nbeen for two generations rapidly coming upon us--for want, in short,\r\nof knowledge of its intellectual history, we in England to-day see\r\nour political leaders in a general attitude of astonishment at the\r\nchanging face of current politics; both great parties drifting vaguely\r\nbefore a nameless undercurrent which they fail utterly to recognize or\r\nunderstand.[14] With some dim impression that Socialism is one of the\r\nUtopian dreams they remember to have heard comfortably disposed of in\r\ntheir academic youth as the impossible ideal of Humanity-intoxicated\r\nFrenchmen, they go their ways through the nineteenth century as a\r\ncountryman blunders through Cheapside. One or two are history fanciers,\r\nlearned in curious details of the past: the present eludes these no\r\nless than the others. They are so near to the individual events that\r\nthey are blind to the onward sweep of the column. They cannot see the\r\nforest for the trees.\r\n\r\nHistory not only gives the clue to the significance of contemporary\r\nevents; it also enables us to understand those who have not yet found\r\nthat clue. We learn to class men and ideas in a kind of geological\r\norder in time. The Comte de Paris gives us excellent proofs that\r\nin absolute monarchy lies the only safety of social order. He is\r\na survival: the type flourished in the sixteenth century; and the\r\nsplendid fossils of that age can be studied in any historic museum.\r\nLord Bramwell will give cogent reasons for the belief that absolute\r\nfreedom of contract, subject to the trifling exception of a drastic\r\ncriminal law, will ensure a perfect State. His lordship is a survival\r\nfrom a nearer epoch: about 1840 this was as far as social science had\r\ngot; and there are still persons who have learnt nothing of later\r\ndate. When I see the Hipparion at South Kensington I do not take his\r\nunfamiliar points to be those of a horse of a superior kind: I know\r\nthat he is an obsolete and superseded pattern, from which the horse has\r\ndeveloped. Historic fossils are more dangerous; for they are left at\r\nlarge, and are not even excluded from Downing Street or Westminster.\r\nBut against the stream of tendencies they are ultimately powerless.\r\nThough they sometimes appear victorious, each successive struggle takes\r\nplace further down the current which they believe themselves to be\r\nresisting.\r\n\r\nThe main stream which has borne European society towards Socialism\r\nduring the past one hundred years is the irresistible progress of\r\nDemocracy. De Tocqueville drove and hammered this truth into the\r\nreluctant ears of the Old World two generations ago; and we have all\r\npretended to carry it about as part of our mental furniture ever\r\nsince. But like most epigrammatic commonplaces, it is not generally\r\nrealized; and De Tocqueville’s book has, in due course, become a\r\nclassic which every one quotes and nobody reads. The progress of\r\nDemocracy is, in fact, often imagined, as by Sir Henry Maine, to\r\nbe merely the substitution of one kind of political machinery for\r\nanother; and there are many political Democrats to-day who cannot\r\nunderstand why social or economic matters should be mixed up with\r\npolitics at all. It was not for this that they broke the power of\r\nthe aristocracy: they were touched not so much with love of the many\r\nas with hatred of the few;[15] and, as has been acutely said--though\r\nusually by foolish persons--they are Radicals merely because they are\r\nnot themselves lords. But it will not long be possible for any man to\r\npersist in believing that the political organization of society can be\r\ncompletely altered without corresponding changes in economic and social\r\nrelations. De Tocqueville expressly pointed out that the progress\r\nof Democracy meant nothing less than a complete dissolution of the\r\nnexus by which society was held together under the old _régime_. This\r\ndissolution is followed by a period of anarchic spiritual isolation\r\nof the individual from his fellows, and to that extent by a general\r\ndenial of the very idea of society. But man is a social animal; and\r\nafter more or less interval there necessarily comes into existence a\r\nnew nexus, differing so entirely from the old-fashioned organization\r\nthat the historic fossil goes about denying that it is a nexus at all,\r\nor that any new nexus is possible or desirable. To him, mostly through\r\nlack of economics, the progress of Democracy is nothing more than the\r\ndestruction of old political privileges; and, naturally enough, few can\r\nsee any beauty in mere dissolution and destruction. Those few are the\r\npurely political Radicals abhorred of Comte and Carlyle: they are in\r\nsocial matters the empiricist survivals from a pre-scientific age.\r\n\r\nThe mere Utopians, on the other hand, who wove the baseless fabric of\r\ntheir visions of reconstructed society on their own private looms,\r\nequally failed, as a rule, to comprehend the problem of the age. They\r\nwere, in imagination, resuscitated Joseph the Seconds, benevolent\r\ndespots who would have poured the old world, had it only been fluid,\r\ninto their new moulds. Against their crude plans the Statesman, the\r\nRadical, and the Political Economist were united; for they took no\r\naccount of the blind social forces which they could not control,\r\nand which went on inexorably working out social salvation in ways\r\nunsuspected by the Utopian.\r\n\r\nIn the present Socialist movement these two streams are united:\r\nadvocates of social reconstruction have learnt the lesson of Democracy,\r\nand know that it is through the slow and gradual turning of the popular\r\nmind to new principles that social reorganization bit by bit comes.\r\nAll students of society who are abreast of their time, Socialists\r\nas well as Individualists, realize that important organic changes\r\ncan only be (1) democratic, and thus acceptable to a majority of the\r\npeople, and prepared for in the minds of all; (2) gradual, and thus\r\ncausing no dislocation, however rapid may be the rate of progress;\r\n(3) not regarded as immoral by the mass of the people, and thus not\r\nsubjectively demoralizing to them; and (4) in this country at any rate,\r\nconstitutional and peaceful. Socialists may therefore be quite at one\r\nwith Radicals in their political methods. Radicals, on the other hand,\r\nare perforce realizing that mere political levelling is insufficient to\r\nsave a State from anarchy and despair. Both sections have been driven\r\nto recognize that the root of the difficulty is economic; and there is\r\nevery day a wider consensus that the inevitable outcome of Democracy is\r\nthe control by the people themselves, not only of their own political\r\norganization, but, through that also, of the main instruments of\r\nwealth production; the gradual substitution of organized co-operation\r\nfor the anarchy of the competitive struggle; and the consequent\r\nrecovery, in the only possible way, of what John Stuart Mill calls “the\r\nenormous share which the possessors of the instruments of industry are\r\nable to take from the produce.”[16] The economic side of the democratic\r\nideal is, in fact, Socialism itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISINTEGRATION OF THE OLD SYNTHESIS.\r\n\r\nAt the middle of the last century Western Europe was still organized on\r\na system of which the basis was virtually a surviving feudalism. The\r\nnexus between man and man was essentially a relation of superiority and\r\ninferiority. Social power still rested either with the monarch, or with\r\nthe owners of large landed estates. Some inroads had already been made\r\nin the perfect symmetry of the organization, notably by the growth of\r\ntowns, and the rise of the still comparatively small trading class; but\r\nthe bulk of the population was arranged in an hierarchical series of\r\nclasses, linked to one another by the bond of Power.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to think of England as differing in this respect from\r\nContinental Europe, and to imagine that our popular freedom was won\r\nin 1688, if not in 1648, or even as far back as Magna Charta itself.\r\nBut as regards the people at large, this was, in the main, merely a\r\ndifference in political form. In England the aristocratic oligarchy had\r\nprevailed over the monarch; in France the King had defeated the Fronde.\r\nFor the mass of the people in either country there was nothing but\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nEven in England the whole political administration was divided between\r\nthe king and the great families; and not one person in 500 possessed\r\nso much as a vote. As lately as 1831 one hundred and fifty persons\r\nreturned a majority of the House of Commons (Molesworth, “History of\r\nthe Reform Bill,” p. 347). The Church, once a universal democratic\r\norganization of international fraternity, had become a mere _appanage_\r\nof the landed gentry. The administration of justice and of the\r\nexecutive government was entirely in their hands, while Parliament was\r\nfilled with their leaders or nominees. No avenue of advancement existed\r\nfor even exceptionally gifted sons of the people; and the masses found\r\nthemselves born into a position of lifelong dependence upon a class of\r\nsuperior birth.\r\n\r\nThe economic organization was of a similar character. Two-thirds of\r\nthe population tilled the soil, and dwelt in lonely hamlets scattered\r\nabout the still sparsely inhabited country. Though possessing the\r\nremnants of ancient communal rights, they were practically dependent on\r\nthe farmers of the parish, who fixed their wages by a constant tacit\r\nconspiracy.[17] The farmers themselves were the obedient serfs of the\r\nlarge proprietors, to whom they paid a customary rent. Though nominally\r\nfree to move, both farmers and laborers were practically fettered to\r\nthe manor by their ignorance and their poverty;[18] and though the lord\r\nhad lost the criminal jurisdiction of his manorial courts, his powers\r\nas Justice of the Peace formed a full equivalent. His unrestrained\r\nownership of the land enabled him to take for himself as rent the\r\nwhole advantage of all but the very worst of the soils in use; and\r\nthe lingering manorial rights gave him toll even from that worst.\r\nThroughout the countryside his word was law and his power irresistible.\r\nIt was a world whose nexus was might, economic and political, tempered\r\nonly by custom and lack of stimulus to change. The poor were not\r\nnecessarily worse off in material matters than they are now; the\r\nagricultural laborer, indeed, was apparently better off in 1750 than\r\nat any other time between 1450 and 1850.[19] But it was a world still\r\nmainly mediæval in political, in economic, and in social relations;\r\na world of status and of permanent social inequalities not differing\r\nessentially from the feudalism of the past.\r\n\r\nThe system had, however, already begun to decay. The rise of the towns\r\nby the growth of trade gradually created new centres of independence\r\nand new classes who broke the bonds of innate status. The intrusion\r\nof the moneyed city classes and the Indian “Nabobs” into the rural\r\ndistricts tended to destroy the feudal idea. The growth of new sects\r\nin religion made fresh points of individual resistance, degenerating\r\noften into spiritual anarchy or unsocial quietism. The spread of\r\nlearning built up a small but active disintegrating force of those\r\nwho had detected the shams around them. But the real Perseus who was\r\nto free the people from their political bondage was Newcomen or Watt,\r\nHargreaves or Crompton, Kay or Arkwright, whichever may be considered\r\nto have contributed the main stroke towards the Industrial Revolution\r\nof the last century.[20] From the inventions of these men came the\r\nmachine industry with its innumerable secondary results--the Factory\r\nSystem and the upspringing of the Northern and Midland industrial\r\ntowns,[21] and the evangelization of the waste places of the earth\r\nby the sale of grey shirtings. Throughout one-third of England the\r\nmanor gave way to the mill or the mine; and the feudal lord had to\r\nslacken his hold of political and social power in order to give full\r\nplay to the change which enriched him with boundless rents and mining\r\nroyalties. And so it happened in England that the final collapse of\r\nmediævalism came, not by the Great Rebellion nor by the Whig Treason of\r\n1688, nor yet by the rule of the Great Commoner, but by the Industrial\r\nRevolution of the eighteenth century, which created the England of\r\nto-day. Within a couple of generations the squire faded away before\r\nthe mill-owner; and feudalism lingered thenceforth only in the rapidly\r\ndiminishing rural districts, and in the empty remnants of ceremonial\r\norganization. The mediæval arrangement, in fact, could not survive the\r\nfall of the cottage industry; and it is, fundamentally, the use of new\r\nmotors which has been for a generation destroying the individualist\r\nconception of property. The landlord and the capitalist are both\r\nfinding that the steam-engine is a Frankenstein which they had better\r\nnot have raised; for with it comes inevitably urban Democracy, the\r\nstudy of Political Economy, and Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe event which brought to a head the influences making for political\r\nchange was the French Revolution. The fall of the Bastille was hailed\r\nby all who had been touched by the new ideas. “How much the greatest\r\nevent it is that ever happened in the world! and how much the best!”\r\nwrote Charles James Fox.[22] It shewed, or seemed to shew, to men that\r\na genuine social reconstruction was not only desirable, but possible.\r\nThe National Assembly, respectable old oligarchy as it was, pointed the\r\nway to legislative fields not even yet completely worked out.\r\n\r\nWhen the rulers of England perceived that in France at least Humpty\r\nDumpty was actually down, the effect at first was to tighten the\r\nexisting organization. The mildest agitation was put down with a\r\ncruelly strong hand. The Whig party in the House of Commons sank to\r\nhalf-a-dozen members. Prices were kept up and wages down, while the\r\nheaviest possible load of taxation was imposed on the suffering people.\r\nThen came the Peace, and Castlereagh’s “White Terror,” culminating in\r\nthe “massacre of Peterloo” (1819) and Lord Sidmouth’s infamous “Six\r\nActs.” But the old order was doomed. The suicide of Castlereagh was\r\nnot only the end of the man, but also the sign of the collapse of the\r\nsystem. With a series of political wrenches there came the Repeal of\r\nthe Test and Corporation Acts (1828), Catholic Emancipation (1829), the\r\nbeginnings of legal and administrative reform, and finally the great\r\nReform Bill of 1832, by which the reign of the middle class superseded\r\naristocratic rule. But the people were no more enfranchised than they\r\nhad been before. The Factory had beaten the Manor for the benefit, not\r\nof the factory hand, but of the millowner. Democracy was at the gates;\r\nbut it was still on the wrong side of them. Its entry, however, was\r\nonly a matter of time. Since 1832 English political history is the\r\nrecord of the reluctant enfranchisement of one class after another, by\r\nmere force of the tendencies of the age. None of these enfranchised\r\nclasses has ever sincerely desired to admit new voters to share the\r\nprivileges and submerge the power which it had won; but each political\r\nparty in turn has been driven to “shoot Niagara” in order to compete\r\nwith its opponents. The Whig Bill of 1832 enfranchised the middle-class\r\nfor Parliament: the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 gave them the\r\ncontrol of the provincial towns. After a generation of agitation,\r\nit was ultimately the Tory party which gave the townspeople in 1867\r\nHousehold Suffrage. Eleven years later a Conservative majority passed\r\nSir Charles Dilke’s Act enfranchising the tenement occupier (1878).\r\nIn 1885 the Liberals, intending permanently to ruin their opponents,\r\ngave the vote to the agricultural laborer; and last year (1888) it was\r\nthe Tories, not to be outdone, who gave him the control of the local\r\nadministration of the counties, and placed the government of London in\r\nthe hands of a popularly elected council. Neither party can claim much\r\ncredit for its reform bills, extorted as they have been, not by belief\r\nin Democracy, but by fear of the opposing faction. Even now the citizen\r\nis tricked out of his vote by every possible legal and administrative\r\ntechnicality; so that more than one-third of our adult men are\r\nunenfranchised,[23] together with the whole of the other sex. Neither\r\nthe Conservative party nor the self-styled “Party of the Masses” gives\r\nproof of any real desire to give the vote to this not inconsiderable\r\nremnant; but both sides pay lip-homage to Democracy; and everyone knows\r\nthat it is merely a waiting race between them as to which shall be\r\ndriven to take the next step. The virtual completion of the political\r\nrevolution is already in sight; and no more striking testimony can be\r\ngiven of the momentum of the new ideas which the Fall of the Bastille\r\neffectually spread over the world than this democratic triumph in\r\nEngland, within less than a century, over the political mediævalism of\r\nten centuries growth.\r\n\r\nThe full significance of this triumph is as yet unsuspected by the\r\nordinary politician. The industrial evolution has left the stranger\r\na landless stranger in his own country. The political evolution is\r\nrapidly making him its ruler. Samson is feeling for his grip on the\r\npillars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF ANARCHY.\r\n\r\nThe result of the industrial revolution, with its dissolution of\r\nmediævalism amid an impetuous reaction against the bureaucratic tyranny\r\nof the past, was to leave all the new elements of society in a state\r\nof unrestrained license. Individual liberty, in the sense of freedom to\r\nprivately appropriate the means of production, reached its maximum at\r\nthe commencement of the century. No sentimental regulations hindered\r\nthe free employment of land and capital to the greatest possible\r\npecuniary gain of the proprietors, however many lives of men, women\r\nand children were used up in the process. Ignorant or unreflecting\r\ncapitalists still speak of that terrible time with exultation. “It was\r\nnot five per cent or ten per cent,” says one, “but thousands per cent\r\nthat made the fortunes of Lancashire.”\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer and those who agree in his worship of\r\nIndividualism[24] apparently desire to bring back the legal position\r\nwhich made possible the “white slavery” of which the “sins of\r\nlegislators” have deprived us; but no serious attempt has ever been\r\nmade to get repealed any one of the Factory Acts. Women working half\r\nnaked in the coal mines; young children dragging trucks all day in the\r\nfoul atmosphere of the underground galleries; infants bound to the\r\nloom for fifteen hours in the heated air of the cotton mill, and kept\r\nawake only by the onlooker’s lash; hours of labor for all, young and\r\nold, limited only by the utmost capabilities of physical endurance;\r\ncomplete absence of the sanitary provisions necessary to a rapidly\r\ngrowing population: these and other nameless iniquities will be found\r\nrecorded as the results of freedom of contract and complete _laisser\r\nfaire_ in the impartial pages of successive blue-book reports.[25] But\r\nthe Liberal mill-owners of the day, aided by some of the political\r\neconomists, stubbornly resisted every attempt to interfere with their\r\nfreedom to use “their” capital and “their” hands as they found most\r\nprofitable, and (like their successors to-day) predicted of each\r\nrestriction as it arrived that it must inevitably destroy the export\r\ntrade and deprive them of all profit whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBut this “acute outbreak of individualism, unchecked by the old\r\nrestraints, and invested with almost a religious sanction by a certain\r\nsoulless school of writers,”[26] was inevitable, after the economic\r\nblundering of governments in the eighteenth century. Prior to the\r\nscientific investigation of economic laws, men had naturally interfered\r\nin social arrangements with very unsatisfactory results. A specially\r\nextravagant or a specially thrifty king debased the currency, and then\r\nwas surprised to find that in spite of stringent prohibitions prices\r\nwent up and all good money fled the country. Wise statesmen, to keep\r\nup wages, encouraged the woollen manufactures of England by ruining\r\nthose of Ireland, and were then astonished to find English wages cut\r\nby Irish pauper immigration. Benevolent parliaments attempted to raise\r\nthe worker’s income by poor law allowances, and then found that they\r\nhad lowered it. Christian kings eliminated half the skilled artisans\r\nfrom their kingdoms, and then found that they had ruined the rest by\r\ndisabling industry. Government inspectors ordered how the cloth should\r\nbe woven, what patterns should be made, and how broad the piece should\r\nbe, until the manufacturers in despair cried out merely to be let alone.\r\n\r\nWhen the early economists realized how radically wrong had been even\r\nthe well-meant attempts to regulate economic relations by legislation,\r\nand how generally these attempts multiplied private monopolies, they\r\nleaned in their deductions heavily towards complete individual liberty.\r\nThe administration of a populous state is such a very difficult\r\nmatter, and when done on false principles is so certain to be badly\r\ndone, that it was natural to advocate rather no administration at all\r\nthan the interference of ignorant and interested bunglers. Nature,\r\nglorified by the worship of a famous school of French philosophers\r\nand English poets, and as yet unsuspected of the countless crimes of\r\n“the struggle for existence,” appeared at least more trustworthy than\r\nCastlereagh. Real Democratic administration seemed, in the time of\r\nthe “White Terror,” and even under the milder Whig hypocrisy which\r\nsucceeded it, hopelessly remote. The best thing to work and fight for\r\nwas, apparently, the reduction to impotence and neutrality of all the\r\n“Powers that Be.” Their influence being for the moment hostile to the\r\npeople, it behooved the people to destroy their influence altogether.\r\nAnd so grew up the doctrine of what Professor Huxley has since called\r\n“Administrative Nihilism.” It was the apotheosis of _Laisser Faire,\r\nLaisser Aller_.\r\n\r\nThough the economists have since had to bear all the blame for what\r\nnearly everyone now perceives to have been an economic and social\r\nmistake, neither Hume nor Adam Smith caught the _laisser faire_ fever\r\nto as great an extent as their French contemporaries and imitators. The\r\nEnglish industrial position was not the same as that of France. The\r\n“mercantile system” by which, as by “Fair Trade” to-day, foreign trade\r\nwas to be regulated and encouraged according as it tended to cause\r\nthe stock of goods, especially coin and bullion, to increase in the\r\ncountry, was the same on both sides of the Channel. But our political\r\nrevolution had already been partly accomplished; and the more obvious\r\nshackles of feudalism had been long since struck off. No Englishman was\r\ncompelled to grind his corn at the mill of the lord of the manor;[27]\r\nto give up unpaid days to plough the lord’s field and cart the lord’s\r\nhay; or to spend his nights in beating the waters of the lord’s marsh\r\nso that the croaking of the frogs might not disturb the lord’s repose.\r\nOur labor dues had long before been commuted for money payments;\r\nand these had become light owing to the change in currency values.\r\nOur apprenticeship laws and guild regulations were becoming rapidly\r\ninoperative. No vexatious excise or gabelle hampered our manufactures.\r\n\r\nTyranny there was, enough and to spare, and economic spoliation; but\r\nthey did not take the form of personal interferences and indignities.\r\nThe non-noble Frenchman was bond, and he knew it; the middle-class\r\nEnglishman to a great extent thought himself free: his economic\r\nservitude, though it galled him, was not clearly distinguishable\r\nfrom the niggardliness of nature. The landlord in France was an\r\nobvious tyrant: here he certainly caused (by the abstraction of the\r\neconomic rent) an artificial barrenness of the workers’ labor; but\r\nthe barrenness was so old and had been so constant that it was not\r\nseen to be artificial, and was not resented as such. No peasant rebels\r\nagainst the blight. Accordingly, we have, since 1381, never had in\r\nEngland a burning of the _chateaux_; and, accordingly, too, Adam Smith\r\nis no complete champion of _laisser faire_, though his great work\r\nwas effective mainly in sweeping away foreign trade restrictions and\r\nregulations, and in giving viability to labor by establishing the\r\nlaborer’s geographical freedom to move and to enter into the wage\r\ncontract when and where he best could. The English economists, stopping\r\nillogically short of the complete freedom preached by Rousseau and\r\nGodwin and the scientific Anarchists of to-day, advocated just as much\r\nfreedom as sufficed to make the fortunes of Lancashire capitalists and\r\nto create the modern proletariat. The Utilitarians are appropriately\r\ncoupled with the Political Economists in connexion with this phase of\r\nthought. Although Adam Smith did not belong to their school, almost\r\nthe whole work of developing and popularizing the new science was done\r\nby them. It was not until after the Peace--when Bentham and James Mill\r\nwere in full vigor, and soon to be reinforced by Austin, Villiers,\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, Roebuck, Grote, Ricardo, and others--that Political\r\nEconomy became a force in England. The motive and enthusiasm for the\r\nnew science undoubtedly came from the Utilitarian ethics. If the sole\r\nmasters of man were pleasure and pain, the knowledge of the natural\r\nlaws expressing the course of social action, and thus regulating\r\npleasure and pain, became of vital importance. If it is God’s will, as\r\nPaley and Austin asserted, that men should seek for happiness, than\r\nthe study of how to obtain economic comfort becomes a sacred duty,\r\nand has ever been so regarded by such rational divines as Malthus,\r\nChalmers, Maurice, Kingsley, and the young High Church party of to-day.\r\nChristianity and the course of modern thought began to join hands;\r\nand we may see in Bishop Berkeley and Paley the forerunners of such a\r\ndevelopment as the Guild of St. Matthew.[28]\r\n\r\nThe Utilitarian philosophy, besides aiding in the popularization of\r\neconomic science, strongly influenced its early character. The tendency\r\nto _Laisser Faire_ inherited from the country and century of upheaval\r\nand revolt against authority, was fostered by Bentham’s destructive\r\ncriticism of all the venerable relics of the past. What is the use\r\nof it, he asked, of every shred of social institution then existing.\r\nWhat is the net result of its being upon individual happiness? Few\r\nof the laws and customs--little, indeed, of the social organization\r\nof that time could stand this test. England was covered with rotten\r\nsurvivals from bygone circumstances; the whole administration was an\r\ninstrument for class domination and parasite nurture; the progress\r\nof the industrial revolution was rapidly making obsolete all laws,\r\ncustoms, proverbs, maxims, and nursery tales; and the sudden increase\r\nof population was baffling all expectations and disconcerting all\r\narrangements. At last it came to be carelessly accepted as the teaching\r\nboth of philosophy and of experience that every man must fight for\r\nhimself; and “the devil take the hindmost” became the accepted\r\nsocial creed of what was still believed to be a Christian nation.\r\nUtilitarianism became the Protestantism of Sociology, and “how to make\r\nfor self and family the best of both worlds” was assumed to be the\r\nduty, as it certainly was the aim, of every practical Englishman.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL REVOLT, AND ITS POLITICAL OUTCOME.\r\n\r\nThe new creed of “Philosophic Radicalism” did not have matters all its\r\nown way. Its doctrines might suit mill-owners and merchant princes,\r\nand all who were able to enjoy the delight of their own strength in\r\nthe battle of life. But it was essentially a creed of Murdstones and\r\nGradgrinds; and the first revolt came from the artistic side. The “nest\r\nof singing birds” at the Lakes would have none of it, though De Quincey\r\nworked out its abstract economics in a manner still unsurpassed.\r\nColeridge did his best to drown it in German Transcendentalism. Robert\r\nOwen and his following of enthusiastic communistic co-operators\r\nsteadfastly held up a loftier ideal. The great mass of the wage earners\r\nnever bowed the knee to the principles upon which the current “White\r\nSlavery” was maintained. But the first man who really made a dint in\r\nthe individualist shield was Carlyle, who knew how to compel men to\r\nlisten to him. Oftener wrong than right in his particular proposals, he\r\nmanaged to keep alive the faith in nobler ends than making a fortune\r\nin this world and saving one’s soul in the next. Then came Maurice,\r\nKingsley, Ruskin, and others who dared to impeach the current middle\r\nclass cult; until finally, through Comte and John Stuart Mill, Darwin\r\nand Herbert Spencer, the conception of the Social Organism has at last\r\npenetrated to the minds, though not yet to the books, even of our\r\nprofessors of Political Economy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, caring for none of these things, the practical man had been\r\nirresistibly driven in the same direction. In the teeth of the current\r\nPolitical Economy, and in spite of all the efforts of the millowning\r\nLiberals, England was compelled to put forth her hand to succor and\r\nprotect her weaker members. Any number of Local Improvement Acts,\r\nDrainage Acts, Truck Acts, Mines Regulation Acts, Factory Acts, Public\r\nHealth Acts, Adulteration Acts, were passing into law.[29] The liberty\r\nof the property owner to oppress the propertyless by the levy of the\r\neconomic tribute of rent and interest began to be circumscribed, pared\r\naway, obstructed and forbidden in various directions. Slice after slice\r\nhas gradually been cut from the profits of capital, and therefore\r\nfrom its selling value, by socially beneficial restrictions on its\r\nuser’s liberty to do as he liked with it. Slice after slice has been\r\ncut off the incomes from rent and interest by the gradual shifting of\r\ntaxation from consumers to persons enjoying incomes above the average\r\nof the kingdom.[30] Step by step the political power and political\r\norganization of the country have been used for industrial ends, until\r\nto-day the largest employer of labor is one of the ministers of the\r\nCrown (the Postmaster-General); and almost every conceivable trade\r\nis, somewhere or other, carried on by parish, municipality, or the\r\nNational Government itself without the intervention of any middleman\r\nor capitalist. The theorists who denounce the taking by the community\r\ninto its own hands of the organization of its own labor as a thing\r\neconomically unclean, repugnant to the sturdy individual independence\r\nof Englishmen, and as yet outside the sphere of practical politics,\r\nseldom have the least suspicion of the extent to which it has already\r\nbeen carried.[31] Besides our international relations and the army,\r\nnavy, police, and the courts of justice, the community now carries on\r\nfor itself, in some part or another of these islands, the post-office,\r\ntelegraphs, carriage of small commodities, coinage, surveys, the\r\nregulation of the currency and note issue, the provision of weights\r\nand measures, the making, sweeping, lighting, and repairing of\r\nstreets, roads, and bridges, life insurance, the grant of annuities,\r\nshipbuilding, stockbroking, banking, farming, and money-lending. It\r\nprovides for many thousands of us from birth to burial--midwifery,\r\nnursery, education, board and lodging, vaccination, medical attendance,\r\nmedicine, public worship, amusements, and interment. It furnishes\r\nand maintains its own museums, parks, art galleries, libraries,\r\nconcert-halls, roads, streets, bridges, markets, slaughter-houses,\r\nfire-engines, lighthouses, pilots, ferries, surf-boats, steam-tugs,\r\nlife-boats, cemeteries, public baths, washhouses, pounds, harbors,\r\npiers, wharves, hospitals, dispensaries, gasworks, waterworks,\r\ntramways, telegraph cables, allotments, cow meadows, artizans’\r\ndwellings, schools, churches, and reading-rooms. It carries on and\r\npublishes its own researches in geology, meteorology, statistics,\r\nzoology, geography, and even theology. In our Colonies the English\r\nGovernment further allows and encourages the communities to provide for\r\nthemselves railways, canals, pawn-broking, theatres, forestry, cinchona\r\nfarms, irrigation, leper villages, casinos, bathing establishments,\r\nand immigration, and to deal in ballast, guano, quinine, opium, salt,\r\nand what not. Every one of these functions, with those of the army,\r\nnavy, police, and courts of justice, were at one time left to private\r\nenterprise, and were a source of legitimate individual investment\r\nof capital. Step by step the community has absorbed them, wholly or\r\npartially; and the area of private exploitation has been lessened.\r\nParallel with this progressive nationalization or municipalization of\r\nindustry, there has gone on the elimination of the purely personal\r\nelement in business management. The older economists doubted whether\r\nanything but banking and insurance could be carried on by joint\r\nstock enterprise: now every conceivable industry, down to baking and\r\nmilk-selling, is successfully managed by the salaried officers of large\r\ncorporations of idle shareholders. More than one-third of the whole\r\nbusiness of England, measured by the capital employed,[32] is now done\r\nby joint stock companies, whose shareholders could be expropriated by\r\nthe community with no more dislocation of the industries carried on\r\nby them than is caused by the daily purchase of shares on the Stock\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\nBesides its direct supersession of private enterprise, the State now\r\nregisters, inspects, and controls nearly all the industrial functions\r\nwhich it has not yet absorbed. In addition to births, marriages,\r\ndeaths, and electors, the State registers all solicitors, barristers,\r\nnotaries, patent agents, brokers, newspaper proprietors, playing-card\r\nmakers, brewers, bankers, seamen, captains, mates, doctors, cabmen,\r\nhawkers, pawnbrokers, tobacconists, distillers, plate dealers,\r\ngame dealers; all insurance companies, friendly societies, endowed\r\nschools and charities, limited companies, lands, houses, deeds, bills\r\nof sale, compositions, ships, arms, dogs, cabs, omnibuses, books,\r\nplays, pamphlets, newspapers, raw cotton movements, trademarks, and\r\npatents; lodging-houses, public-houses, refreshment-houses, theatres,\r\nmusic-halls, places of worship, elementary schools, and dancing rooms.\r\n\r\nNor is the registration a mere form. Most of the foregoing are also\r\ninspected and criticised, as are all railways, tramways, ships,\r\nmines, factories, canal-boats, public conveyances, fisheries,\r\nslaughter-houses, dairies, milkshops, bakeries, baby-farms, gasmeters,\r\nschools of anatomy, vivisection laboratories, explosive works, Scotch\r\nherrings, and common lodging-houses.\r\n\r\nThe inspection is often detailed and rigidly enforced. The State in\r\nmost of the larger industrial operations prescribes the age of the\r\nworker, the hours of work, the amount of air, light, cubic space, heat,\r\nlavatory accommodation, holidays and mealtimes; where, when and how\r\nwages shall be paid; how machinery staircases, lift holes, mines and\r\nquarries are to be fenced and guarded; how and when the plant shall\r\nbe cleaned, repaired and worked. Even the kind of package in which\r\nsome articles shall be sold is duly prescribed, so that the individual\r\ncapitalist shall take no advantage of his position. On every side he is\r\nbeing registered, inspected, controlled and eventually superseded by\r\nthe community; and in the meantime he is compelled to cede for public\r\npurposes an ever-increasing share of his rent and interest.\r\n\r\nEven in the fields still abandoned to private enterprise, its\r\noperations are thus every day more closely limited, in order that the\r\nanarchic competition of private greed, which at the beginning of the\r\ncentury was set up as the only infallible beneficent principle of\r\nsocial action, may not utterly destroy the State. All this has been\r\ndone by “practical” men, ignorant, that is to say, of any scientific\r\nsociology, believing Socialism to be the most foolish of dreams,\r\nand absolutely ignoring, as they thought, all grandiloquent claims\r\nfor social reconstruction. Such is the irresistible sweep of social\r\ntendencies, that in their every act they worked to bring about the very\r\nSocialism they despised; and to destroy the Individualistic faith which\r\nthey still professed. They builded better than they knew.\r\n\r\nIt must by no means be supposed that these beginnings of social\r\nreorganization have been effected, or the proposals for their\r\nextension brought to the front, without the conscious efforts of\r\nindividual reformers. The “Zeitgeist” is potent; but it does not pass\r\nActs of Parliament without legislators, or erect municipal libraries\r\nwithout town councillors. Though our decisions are moulded by the\r\ncircumstances of the time, and the environment at least roughhews our\r\nends, shape them as we will; yet each generation decides for itself.\r\nIt still rests with the individual to resist or promote the social\r\nevolution, consciously or unconsciously, according to his character\r\nand information. The importance of complete consciousness of the\r\nsocial tendencies of the age lies in the fact that its existence and\r\ncomprehensiveness often determine the expediency of our particular\r\naction: we move with less resistance with the stream than against it.\r\n\r\nThe general failure to realize the extent to which our unconscious\r\nSocialism has already proceeded--a failure which causes much time\r\nand labor to be wasted in uttering and elaborating on paper the\r\nmost ludicrously unpractical anti-Socialistic demonstrations of the\r\nimpossibility of matters of daily occurrence--is due to the fact that\r\nfew know anything of local administration outside their own town. It is\r\nthe municipalities which have done most to “socialize” our industrial\r\nlife; and the municipal history of the century is yet unwritten. A few\r\nparticulars may here be given as to this progressive “municipalization”\r\nof industry. Most of us know that the local governments have assumed\r\nthe care of the roads, streets and bridges, once entirely abandoned\r\nto individual enterprise, as well as the lighting and cleansing of\r\nall public thoroughfares, and the provision of sewers, drains and\r\n“storm-water courses.” It is, perhaps, not so generally known that no\r\nless than £7,500,000 is annually expended on these services in England\r\nand Wales alone, being about five per cent of the rent of the country.\r\nThe provision of markets, fairs, harbors, piers, docks, hospitals,\r\ncemeteries and burial-grounds is still shared with private capitalists;\r\nbut those in public hands absorb nearly £2,000,000 annually. Parks,\r\npleasure grounds, libraries, museums, baths and washhouses cost the\r\npublic funds over half a million sterling. All these are, however,\r\ncomparatively unimportant services. It is in the provision of gas,\r\nwater and tramways that local authorities organize labor on a large\r\nscale. Practically half the gas consumers in the kingdom are supplied\r\nby public gas works, which exist in 168 separate localities, with\r\nan annual expenditure of over three millions.[33] It need hardly be\r\nadded that the advantage to the public is immense, in spite of the\r\nenormous price paid for the work in many instances; and that the\r\nfurther municipalization of the gas industry is proceeding with great\r\nrapidity, no fewer than twelve local authorities having obtained loans\r\nfor the purpose (and one for electric lighting) in a single year\r\n(Local Government Board Report, 1887-8, c--5526, pp. 319-367). With\r\nequal rapidity is the water supply becoming a matter of commercial\r\norganization, the public expenditure already reaching nearly a million\r\nsterling annually. Sixty-five local authorities borrowed money for\r\nwater supply in 1887-8, rural and urban districts being equally\r\nrepresented (c--5550, pp. 319-367). Tramways and ferries are undergoing\r\nthe same development. About thirty-one towns, including nearly all\r\nthe larger provincial centres, own some or all of their own tramways.\r\nManchester, Bradford, Birmingham, Oldham, Sunderland and Greenock lease\r\ntheir undertakings; but among the municipalities Huddersfield has the\r\ngood sense to work its lines without any “middleman” intervention,\r\nwith excellent public results. The tramway mileage belonging to local\r\nauthorities has increased five-fold since 1878, and comprises more than\r\na quarter of the whole (House of Commons Return, 1887-8, No. 347). The\r\nlast important work completed by the Metropolitan Board of Works was\r\nthe establishment of a “free steam ferry” on the Thames, charged upon\r\nthe rates. This is, in some respects, the most significant development\r\nof all. The difference between a free steam ferry and a free railway is\r\nobviously only one of degree.\r\n\r\nA few more cases are worth mentioning. Glasgow builds and maintains\r\nseven public “common lodging houses”; Liverpool provides science\r\nlectures; Manchester builds and stocks an art gallery; Birmingham\r\nruns schools of design; Leeds creates extensive cattle markets; and\r\nBradford supplies water below cost price. There are nearly one hundred\r\nfree libraries and reading rooms. The minor services now performed by\r\npublic bodies are innumerable.[34] This “Municipal Socialism” has been\r\nrendered possible by the creation of a local debt now reaching over\r\n£181,000,000.[35] Nearly £10,000,000 is annually paid as interest and\r\nsinking fund on the debt; and to this extent the pecuniary benefit of\r\nmunicipalization is diminished. The full advantages[36] of the public\r\norganization of labor remain, besides a considerable pecuniary profit;\r\nwhilst the objective differentiation of the economic classes (by the\r\nseparation of the idle _rentier_ from the manager or _entrepreneur_)\r\nenormously facilitates popular comprehension of the nature of the\r\neconomic tribute known as interest. To the extent, moreover, that\r\nadditional charges are thrown upon the rates, the interest paid to\r\nthe capitalist is levied mainly at the cost of the landlord, and we\r\nhave a corresponding “nationalization” of so much of the economic\r\nrent. The increase in the local rates has been 36 per cent, or nearly\r\n£7,000,000, in eleven years, and is still growing. They now amount to\r\nover twenty-six millions sterling in England and Wales alone, or about\r\n17 per cent of the rental of the country (C--5550, p. clxxiv).\r\n\r\nNor is there any apparent prospect of a slackening of the pace of this\r\nunconscious abandonment of individualism. No member of Parliament\r\nhas so much as introduced a Bill to give effect to the anarchist\r\nprinciples of Mr. Herbert Spencer’s “Man _versus_ the State.” The\r\nnot disinterested efforts of the Liberty and Property Defence League\r\nfail to hinder even Conservative Parliament from further Socialistic\r\nlegislation. Mr. Gladstone remarked to a friend in 1886 that the Home\r\nRule question would turn the Liberal party into a Radical party. He\r\nmight have said that it would make both parties Socialistic. Free\r\nelementary and public technical education is now practically accepted\r\non both sides of the House, provided that the so-called “voluntary\r\nschools,” themselves half maintained from public funds, are not\r\nextinguished. Mr. Chamberlain and the younger Conservatives openly\r\nadvocate far reaching projects of social reform through state and\r\nmunicipal agency, as a means of obtaining popular support. The National\r\nLiberal Federation adopts the special taxation of urban ground values\r\nas the main feature in its domestic programme,[37] notwithstanding\r\nthat this proposal is characterized by old-fashioned Liberals as sheer\r\nconfiscation of so much of the landlords’ property. The London Liberal\r\nand Radical Union, which has Mr. John Morley for its president, even\r\nproposes that the County Council shall have power to rebuild the London\r\nslums at the sole charge of the ground landlord.[38] It is, therefore,\r\nnot surprising that the Trades Union Congress should now twice have\r\ndeclared in favor of “Land Nationalization” by large majorities, or\r\nthat the bulk of the London County Council should be returned on\r\nan essentially Socialistic platform. The whole of the immediately\r\npracticable demands of the most exacting Socialists are, indeed, now\r\noften embodied in the current Radical programme; and the following\r\nexposition of it, from the pages of the _Star_ newspaper, August 8,\r\n1888, may serve as a statement of the current Socialist demands for\r\nfurther legislation.[39]\r\n\r\nREVISION OF TAXATION.\r\n\r\n _Object._--Complete shifting of burden from the workers, of whatever\r\n grade, to the recipients of rent and interest, with a view to the\r\n ultimate and gradual extinction of the latter class.\r\n\r\n _Means._--1.

Like John Stuart Mill,[41] though less\r\nexplicitly, he has turned from mere political Democracy to a complete,\r\nthough unconscious, Socialism.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW SYNTHESIS.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the social philosophy of the time did\r\nnot remain unaffected by the political evolution and the industrial\r\ndevelopment. Slowly sinking into men’s minds all this while was the\r\nconception of a new social nexus, and a new end of social life. It\r\nwas discovered (or rediscovered) that a society is something more\r\nthan an aggregate of so many individual units--that it possesses\r\nexistence distinguishable from those of any of its components. A\r\nperfect city became recognized as something more than any number of\r\ngood citizens--something to be tried by other tests, and weighed in\r\nother balances than the individual man. The community must necessarily\r\naim, consciously or not, at its continuance as a community; its life\r\ntranscends that of any of its members; and the interests of the\r\nindividual unit must often clash with those of the whole. Though\r\nthe social organism has itself evolved from the union of individual\r\nmen, the individual is now created by the social organism of which\r\nhe forms a part: his life is born of the larger life; his attributes\r\nare moulded by the social pressure; his activities, inextricably\r\ninterwoven with others, belong to the activity of the whole. Without\r\nthe continuance and sound health of the social organism, no man can\r\nnow live or thrive; and its persistence is accordingly his paramount\r\nend. His conscious motive for action may be, nay, always must be,\r\nindividual to himself; but where such action proves inimical to the\r\nsocial welfare, it must sooner or later be checked by the whole, lest\r\nthe whole perish through the error of its member. The conditions of\r\nsocial health are accordingly a matter for scientific investigation.\r\nThere is, at any moment, one particular arrangement of social relations\r\nwhich involves the minimum of human misery then and there possible\r\namid the “niggardliness of nature.” Fifty years ago it would have been\r\nassumed that absolute freedom in the sense of individual or “manly”\r\nindependence, plus a criminal code, would spontaneously result in\r\nsuch an arrangement for each particular nation; and the effect was\r\nthe philosophic apotheosis of _Laisser Faire_. To-day every student\r\nis aware that no such optimistic assumption is warranted by the facts\r\nof life.[43] We know now that in natural selection at the stage of\r\ndevelopment where the existence of civilized mankind is at stake, the\r\nunits selected from are not individuals, but societies. Its action at\r\nearlier stages, though analogous, is quite dissimilar. Among the lower\r\nanimals physical strength or agility is the favored quality; if some\r\nheaven-sent genius among the cuttlefish developed a delicate poetic\r\nfaculty, this high excellence would not delay his succumbing to his\r\nhulking neighbor. When, higher up in the scale, mental cunning became\r\nthe favored attribute, an extra brain convolution, leading primitive\r\nman to the invention of fire or tools, enabled a comparatively puny\r\nsavage to become the conqueror and survivor of his fellows.\r\n\r\nBrain culture accordingly developed apace; but we do not yet thoroughly\r\nrealize that this has itself been superseded as the “selected”\r\nattribute, by social organization. The cultivated Athenians, Saracens,\r\nand Provençals went down in the struggle for existence before their\r\nrespective competitors, who, individually inferior, were in possession\r\nof a, at that time, more valuable social organization. The French\r\nnation was beaten in the last war, not because the average German was\r\nan inch and a half taller than the average Frenchman, or because he\r\nhad read five more books, but because the German social organism, was,\r\nfor the purposes of the time, superior in efficiency to the French.\r\nIf we desire to hand on to the after-world our direct influence, and\r\nnot merely the memory of our excellence, we must take even more care\r\nto improve the social organism of which we form part, than to perfect\r\nour own individual developments. Or rather, the perfect and fitting\r\ndevelopment of each individual is not necessarily the utmost and\r\nhighest cultivation of his own personality, but the filling, in the\r\nbest possible way, of his humble function in the great social machine.\r\nWe must abandon the self-conceit of imagining that we are independent\r\nunits, and bend our jealous minds, absorbed in their own cultivation,\r\nto this subjection to the higher end, the Common Weal. Accordingly,\r\nconscious “direct adaptation” steadily supplants the unconscious and\r\nwasteful “indirect adaptation” of the earlier form of the struggle for\r\nexistence; and with every advance in sociological knowledge, Man is\r\nseen to assume more and more, not only the mastery of “things,” but\r\nalso a conscious control over social destiny itself.\r\n\r\nThis new scientific conception of the Social Organism, has put\r\ncompletely out of countenance the cherished principles of the Political\r\nEconomist and the Philosophic Radical. We left them sailing gaily\r\ninto Anarchy on the stream of _Laisser Faire_. Since then the tide\r\nhas turned. The publication of John Stuart Mill’s “Political Economy”\r\nin 1848 marks conveniently the boundary of the old individualist\r\nEconomics. Every edition of Mill’s book became more and more\r\nSocialistic. After his death the world learnt the personal history,\r\npenned by his own hand,[44] of his development from a mere political\r\ndemocrat to a convinced Socialist.\r\n\r\nThe change in tone since then has been such that one competent\r\neconomist, professedly[45] anti-Socialist, publishes regretfully to the\r\nworld that all the younger men are now Socialists, as well as many of\r\nthe older Professors. It is, indeed, mainly from these that the world\r\nhas learnt how faulty were the earlier economic generalizations, and\r\nabove all, how incomplete as guides for social or political action.\r\nThese generalizations are accordingly now to be met with only in\r\nleading articles, sermons, or the speeches of Ministers or Bishops.[46]\r\nThe Economist himself knows them no more.\r\n\r\nThe result of this development of Sociology is to compel a revision\r\nof the relative importance of liberty and equality as principles to\r\nbe kept in view in social administration. In Bentham’s celebrated\r\n“ends” to be aimed at in a civil code, liberty stands predominant\r\nover equality, on the ground that full equality can be maintained\r\nonly by the loss of security for the fruits of labor. That exposition\r\nremains as true as ever; but the question for decision remains, how\r\nmuch liberty? Economic analysis has destroyed the value of the old\r\ncriterion of respect for the equal liberty of others. Bentham, whose\r\neconomics were weak, paid no attention to the perpetual tribute on the\r\nfruits of others’ labor which full private property in land inevitably\r\ncreates. In his view, liberty and security to property meant that every\r\nworker should be free to obtain the full result of his own labor; and\r\nthere appeared no inconsistency between them. The political economist\r\nnow knows that with free competition and private property in land and\r\ncapital, no individual can possibly obtain the full result of his\r\nown labor. The student of industrial development, moreover, finds it\r\nsteadily more and more impossible to trace what is precisely the result\r\nof each separate man’s toil. Complete rights of liberty and property\r\nnecessarily involve, for example, the spoliation of the Irish cottier\r\ntenant for the benefit of Lord Clanricarde. What then becomes of the\r\nBenthamic principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number?\r\nWhen the Benthamite comes to understand the Law of Rent, which of the\r\ntwo will he abandon? For he cannot escape the lesson of the century,\r\ntaught alike by the economists, the statesmen, and the “practical men,”\r\nthat complete individual liberty, with unrestrained private ownership\r\nof the instruments of wealth production, is irreconcilable with the\r\ncommon weal. The free struggle for existence among ourselves menaces\r\nour survival as a healthy and permanent social organism. Evolution,\r\nProfessor Huxley[47] declares, is the substitution of consciously\r\nregulated co-ordination among the units of each organism, for blind\r\nanarchic competition. Thirty years ago Herbert Spencer demonstrated\r\nthe incompatibility of full private property in land with the modern\r\ndemocratic State;[48] and almost every economist now preaches the\r\nsame doctrine. The Radical is rapidly arriving, from practical\r\nexperience, at similar conclusions; and the steady increase of the\r\ngovernment regulation of private enterprise, the growth of municipal\r\nadministration, and the rapid shifting of the burden of taxation\r\ndirectly to rent and interest, mark in treble lines the statesman’s\r\nunconscious abandonment of the old Individualism, and our irresistible\r\nglide into collectivist Socialism.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the Democracy should learn this lesson. With the\r\nmasses painfully conscious of the failure of Individualism to create\r\na decent social life for four-fifths of the people,[49] it might have\r\nbeen foreseen that Individualism could not survive their advent to\r\npolitical power. If private property in land and capital necessarily\r\nkeeps the many workers permanently poor (through no fault of their\r\nown), in order to make the few idlers rich (from no merit of their\r\nown), private property in land and capital will inevitably go the way\r\nof the feudalism which it superseded. The economic analysis confirms\r\nthe rough generalization of the suffering people. The history of\r\nindustrial evolution points to the same result; and for two generations\r\nthe world’s chief ethical teachers have been urging the same lesson. No\r\nwonder the heavens of Individualism are rolling up before our eyes like\r\na scroll; and even the Bishops believe and tremble.[50]\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, possible, as Sir Henry Maine and others have\r\nsuggested, that the whole experience of the century is a mistake, and\r\nthat political power will once more swing back into the hands of a\r\nmonarch or an aristocratic oligarchy. It is, indeed, want of faith in\r\nDemocracy which holds back most educated sympathisers with Socialism\r\nfrom frankly accepting its principles. What the economic side of such\r\npolitical atavism would be it is not easy to forecast. The machine\r\nindustry and steam power could hardly be dismissed with the caucus\r\nand the ballot-box. So long, however, as Democracy in political\r\nadministration continues to be the dominant principle, Socialism may\r\nbe quite safely predicted as its economic obverse, in spite of those\r\nfreaks or aberrations of Democracy which have already here and there\r\nthrown up a short-lived monarchy or a romantic dictatorship. Every\r\nincrease in the political power of the proletariat will most surely be\r\nused by them for their economic and social protection. In England, at\r\nany rate, the history of the century serves at once as their guide and\r\ntheir justification.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] See “Socialism in England” (American Economic Association, vol.\r\niv, part 2, May, 1889), in which a portion of this essay has been\r\nembodied.\r\n\r\n[13] “I am aware that there are some who suppose that our present\r\nbourgeois arrangements must be totally destroyed and others substituted\r\nalmost at a blow.

It needed an Act of Parliament in 1758 (32 George II,\r\nc. 61) to free the inhabitants of the “village” of Manchester from the\r\nobligation to grind all their corn and grain at the manorial watermills\r\n(Clifford’s “History of Private Bill Legislation,” vol. ii, p. 478).\r\nEven so late as 1809 they had to obtain the consent of Sir Oswald\r\nMosley, the lord of the manor, before a company could be incorporated\r\nto provide a water supply (_Ibid._, p. 480). Leeds was theoretically\r\ncompelled to grind its corn, grain and malt at the lord’s mills down to\r\n1839, and actually had then to pay £13,000 to extinguish this feudal\r\n“due” (_Ibid._, p. 498).\r\n\r\n[28] See its organ, the _Church Reformer_. London; 8 Duke Street,\r\nAdelphi.\r\n\r\n[29] The beginning of factory legislation is to be found in the “Morals\r\nand Health Act,” 42 Geo. III, c. 73 (1802). Others followed in 1819,\r\n1825, and 1831; but their provisions were almost entirely evaded owing\r\nto the absence of inspectors. After the Reform Bill more stringent\r\nenactments in 1833, 1844, and 1847 secured some improvement. The Act\r\nof 1878 consolidated the law on the subject. The Radical and Socialist\r\nproposals for further development in this direction will be found at\r\npage 55. Nearly 400 Local Improvement Acts had been passed up to 1845.\r\nIn the succeeding years various general Acts were passed, which were\r\nhenceforth incorporated by reference in all local Acts. The first\r\n“Public Health Act” was passed in 1848; and successive extensions were\r\ngiven to this restrictive legislation with sanitary ends in 1855,\r\n1858, 1861, and 1866. Consolidating Acts in 1871, and finally in 1875,\r\ncomplete the present sanitary code, which now forms a thick volume of\r\nrestrictions upon the free use of land and capital.\r\n\r\n[30] The _minimum_ income chargeable to Income Tax (£150) closely\r\ncorresponds with the _average_ family income.

From\r\nthis I wish to draw a moral. That moral is that there has been and\r\nis proceeding an economic evolution, practically independent of our\r\nindividual desires or prejudices; an evolution which has changed for\r\nus the whole social problem by changing the conditions of material\r\nproduction, and which _ipso facto_ effects a revolution in our modern\r\nlife. To learn clearly what that revolution is, and to prepare\r\nourselves for taking advantage of it in due course--this I take to be\r\nbriefly what is meant by Socialism. The ignorant public, represented\r\nby, let us say, the average bishop or member of Parliament, hears of\r\nthe “Social Revolution” and instantly thinks of street riots, noyades,\r\nwith a _coup d’état_: a 10th of August, followed perhaps by its Nemesis\r\nin an 18th Brumaire. But these are not the Social Revolution. That\r\ngreat change is proceeding silently every day. Each new line of railway\r\nwhich opens up the trackless desert, every new machine which supplants\r\nhand labor, each fresh combination formed by capitalists, every new\r\nlabor organization, every change in prices, each new invention--all\r\nthese forces and many more are actually working out a social revolution\r\nbefore our eyes: for they are changing fundamentally the economic basis\r\nof life. There may possibly come some one supreme moment of time in\r\nwhich a great dramatic incident will reveal to men the significance\r\nof the changes which have led up to it, and of which it is merely\r\nthe final expression. And future historians may write of that as The\r\nRevolution just as historians now write of the fall of the Bastille,\r\nor the execution of Louis XVI, as though these events constituted the\r\nFrench Revolution, instead of being the final terms in a long series\r\nof events which had been loosening the fabric of French feudalism\r\nthrough several generations. The true prophet is not an ignorant\r\nsoothsayer who foretells some Armageddon, but rather he who perceives\r\nthe inevitable drift and tendency of things. Somewhat in this spirit\r\nwe may consider the economic history of the modern industrial era in\r\norder to discern its meaning, to see what it has led up to, and what,\r\nconsequently, are the problems with which we find ourselves confronted\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nHad we visited a village or small town in England where industrial\r\noperations were going on one hundred and fifty years ago, what should\r\nwe have found? No tall chimney, vomiting its clouds of smoke, would\r\nhave been visible; no huge building with its hundred windows blazing\r\nwith light would have loomed up before the traveller as he entered the\r\ntown at dusk; no din of machinery would have been heard; no noise of\r\nsteam hammers; no huge blast furnaces would have met his eye, nor would\r\nmiles of odors wafted from chemical works have saluted his nostrils. If\r\nLancashire had been the scene of his visit he would have found a number\r\nof narrow red-brick houses with high steps in front, and outside wooden\r\nshutters such as one may still see in the old parts of some Lancashire\r\ntowns to-day. Inside each of these houses was a little family workshop,\r\ncontaining neither master nor servant, in which the family jointly\r\ncontributed to produce by the labor of their hands a piece of cotton\r\ncloth. The father provided his own warp of linen yarn, and his cotton\r\nwool for weft. He had purchased the yarn in a prepared state, while\r\nthe wool for the weft was carded and spun by his wife and daughters,\r\nand the cloth was woven by himself and his sons. There was a simple\r\ndivision of labor in the tiny cottage factory; but all the implements\r\nnecessary to produce the cotton cloth were owned by the producers.\r\nThere was neither capitalist nor wage-receiver: the weaver controlled\r\nhis own labor, effected his own exchange, and received himself the\r\nequivalent of his own product. Such was the germ of the great English\r\ncotton manufacture. Ferdinand Lasselle said: “Society consists of\r\nninety-six proletaires and four capitalists. That is your State.” But\r\nin old Lancashire there was neither capitalist nor proletaire.\r\n\r\nOr even much later had one visited--Stafford, let us say, one would\r\nnot have found the large modern shoe-factory, with its bewildering\r\nvariety of machines, each one with a human machine by its side. For\r\nshoemaking then was a pure handicraft, requiring skill, judgment and\r\nsome measure of artistic sense. Each shoemaker worked in his own little\r\nhouse, bought his own material from the leather merchant, and fashioned\r\nevery part of the shoe with his own hand, aided by a few simple and\r\ninexpensive tools. He believed there was “nothing like leather,” and\r\nhad not yet learned the art of putting on cheap soles, _not_ made of\r\nleather, to cheap boots, which, in a month’s time, will be almost worn\r\nout. Very likely the shoemaker had no vote; but he was never liable\r\nto be locked out by his employer, or to be obliged to go on strike\r\nagainst a reduction of wages, with his boy in prison for satisfying\r\nhunger at the expense of the neighboring baker, or his girl on the\r\nstreets to pay for her new dress. Such was the simple industrialism of\r\nour great-great-grandfathers. But their mode of life was destined to\r\nchange. All progress, says Mr. Herbert Spencer, is differentiation; and\r\nthis formidable factor began to appear in the quiet, sleepy, English\r\ncountry. About 1760 a large share of calico-printing was transferred\r\nfrom London to Lancashire, where labor was then cheaper. There was a\r\nconsequent fall in prices, and an increased demand for calicoes of\r\nlinen warp and cotton weft. Then the Manchester dealers, instead of\r\nbuying fustians and calicoes from the weaver, began to furnish him\r\nwith the materials for his cloth, and to pay him a fixed price per\r\npiece for the work when executed. So the Manchester dealer became\r\nwhat the French call an _entrepreneur_; and the transformation of\r\nthe independent weaver into a wage receiver began. The iron law of\r\nwages and the unemployed question also began to loom dimly up. For\r\nas the weaver came to hire himself to the dealer, so the weaver let\r\nout part of his work; and it frequently happened that the sum which\r\nthe master weaver received from his employer was less than what he\r\nfound himself compelled to pay to those whom he employed in spinning.\r\n“He durst not, however, complain,” says Mr. Watts in his article on\r\ncotton (Encyclopædia Britannica), “much less abate the spinner’s price,\r\nlest his looms should be unemployed.” The quantity of yarn producible\r\nunder this simple system by the aid of the one-thread wheel was very\r\nsmall. The whole did not exceed in quantity what 50,000 spindles of\r\nour present machinery can yield. As one man can now superintend 2,000\r\nspindles, it will be seen that twenty-five men with machinery can\r\nproduce as much as the whole population of old Lancashire. In 1750 the\r\nfirst important invention in the cotton industry was made in the shape\r\nof the fly-shuttle, invented by Kaye of Bury. In 1760 improvements were\r\nmade in the carding process. In 1767 the spinning-jenny was invented by\r\nHargreaves, and this was at length brought to work as many as eighty\r\nspindles. The ingenious Hargreaves had ample opportunity for practical\r\nstudy of the “unemployed” question; for the spinners, some of whom were\r\nforced into idleness by the new invention, broke into his house and\r\ndestroyed his machine. Shortly after, there was a general rising over\r\nindustrial Lancashire: the poor hand-workers, whose prophetic souls\r\nwere evidently dreaming on things to come, scouring the country and\r\nbreaking in pieces every carding and spinning machine they could find.\r\n\r\nProgress by differentiation, however, heeded not the second sight of\r\nLancashire workers. In 1769, Arkwright contrived the spinning frame,\r\nand obtained his patent for spinning with rollers. In 1775, Crompton,\r\nof Bolton, invented the mule-jenny, enabling warps of the finest\r\nquality to be spun. In 1792, further improvements in this machine\r\nwere made by Pollard, of Manchester, and Kelly, of Glasgow. In 1785,\r\nsteam was first applied to the spinning of cotton in Nottinghamshire.\r\nIn 1784 the Rev. E. Cartwright, of Kent, invented power-loom weaving,\r\nand completed and patented his invention in August, 1787. Here, then,\r\nwithin a period of about forty years, was a series of mechanical\r\ninventions which had the effect of absolutely changing the method of\r\nproduction, and enormously increasing the output; of dividing the\r\nlabor of producing, which had formerly been effected by a single\r\nfamily within the walls of a single room, between scores and hundreds\r\nof people, each of whom only undertook a single process in a complex\r\noperation; of massing together hundreds of thousands of people under\r\nnew conditions; of bringing a heretofore isolated district into\r\nintimate relations with distant foreign lands: and of separating the\r\nwork of spinning or weaving from the ownership of the instruments by\r\nwhose aid the work was done. The independent weaver was gone; or rather\r\nhe was subjected, like an amœba, to a process of fission, but with\r\nthis difference: that whereas the amœba produces by fission other\r\nsimilar amœbæ, the weaver was differentiated into a person called an\r\nemployer and another called an employé or “hand.” Multiply this “hand”\r\nby thousands, and we get the mill or factory, divided into departments,\r\neach with its special detail of work, each detail fitting into all the\r\nrest, each machine taking up the work where the last machine left it,\r\nand each contributing its share to the joint product. Multiply the\r\nemployer; add enormously to the aggregate of his capital; remove the\r\nbarrier of national frontiers from his operations; relieve him of the\r\nduty of personal supervision; and we get the joint-stock capitalist.\r\n\r\nPause a moment to consider the famous world-events which made so much\r\nnoise while these industrial processes were going on. The conquest\r\nof Canada, the victories of Clive in India, the Seven Years’ War,\r\nthe successful revolt of the American colonies, the Declaration of\r\nIndependence and formation of the American Constitution, the deeds of\r\nFrederic the Great, Pitt’s accession to power, Washington’s election\r\nto the Presidency, the Fall of the Bastille, the death of Mirabeau,\r\nthe fall of the old French monarchy, the National Convention--all\r\nthese great events which shook the world were contemporary with the\r\nindustrial revolution in England; and that revolution was in promise\r\nand potency more important than them all.\r\n\r\nI will glance at the development of another great industry, that of\r\niron. In former times iron was largely worked in the south of England,\r\nnotably in Sussex, in a district now purely agricultural. By the middle\r\nof the 18th century, important iron industries had begun to cluster\r\nround Coalbrookdale; and here many of the industrial changes in the\r\nworking of iron were first introduced. From 1766 to 1784 improvements\r\nwere made in the mode of working malleable iron and of transferring\r\ncast into wrought iron. The puddling forge was invented in 1784; and\r\nit gave an immense impetus to the manufacture. In 1828 the use of the\r\nhot blast was substituted for cold air; in 1842 Nasmyth invented the\r\nsteam-hammer; and in 1856 the Bessemer process of making steel was\r\npatented. Subsequently we have the Siemens regenerative furnace and\r\ngas producer, the use of machinery in lieu of hand labor for puddling,\r\nthe casting of steel under great pressure, and the improvements in\r\nthe Bessemer process. As a result of these inventions the increase\r\nin the production of steel during the last few years, especially in\r\nthe United States and Great Britain, has been enormous. In all this\r\nwe see the same series of phenomena, all tending to huge monopolies.\r\nMachinery supplants hand labor; production is greatly stimulated; the\r\nimmense capital needed enables only the large producers to survive in\r\nthe competitive conflict; and we get as the net result well defined\r\naggregations of capital on the one hand, and dependent machine minders\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the shoe industry as having been formerly a pure\r\nhandicraft. Simple machine processes for fastening soles and heels to\r\ninner soles began to be adopted in 1809; and from that time onward\r\nsuccessive inventions have converted the pure handicraft into one of\r\nthe most mechanical industries in the world. In the United States in\r\n1881 no less than 50,000,000 pairs of boots and shoes were sewn by\r\nthe Blake-Mackay machines. A visitor to a shoe factory to-day will\r\nsee the following machines: for cutting leather, for pressing rollers\r\nfor sole leather, for stamping out sole and heel pieces, for blocking\r\nand crimping, for moulding uppers or vamps, for vamp-folding, for\r\neyeletting, lasting, trimming and paring, scouring, sand-papering\r\nand burnishing, for stamping, peg-cutting, and nail-rasping. It is\r\nwell to witness all these processes going on in one large factory in\r\norder to grasp fully the idea that the old individual industry of the\r\nlast century is almost as extinct as the mastodon--that the worker in\r\na shoe factory to-day is, so to speak, a machine in a vast complex\r\nsystem. The great industry has supplanted the small one; such great\r\nindustry involves the aggregation of capital: consequently competition\r\non the part of the small producer is hopeless and impossible. Thus\r\nin the proletarian class the intensity of the struggle for existence\r\nis increased, keeping down wages and ever widening the margin of the\r\nunemployed class. The small producer must become a wage earner either\r\nas manager, foreman, or workman. As well attempt to meet Gatling guns\r\nwith bow and arrows, or steel cruisers armed with dynamite bombs\r\nwith the little cockle-shells in which Henry V’s army crossed over\r\nto win the field of Agincourt, as to set up single shoe-makers or\r\ncotton-weavers against the vast industrial armies of the world of\r\nmachinery. The revolution is confined to no one industry, to no one\r\nland. While most fully developed in England, it is extending to most\r\nindustries and to all lands. Prince Kropotkin, it is true, reminds us\r\nin an interesting article in the _Nineteenth Century_ for October,\r\n1888, that a number of small industries can still be found in town\r\nand country. That is so, no doubt; and it is not unlikely that for\r\na long time to come many small trades may exist, and some may even\r\nflourish. But the countries in which small industries flourish most\r\nare precisely those in which there is least machine industry, and\r\nwhere consequently capitalism is least developed. In no country, says\r\nKropotkin, are there so many small producers as in Russia. Exactly:\r\nand in no country is there so little machinery or such an inefficient\r\nrailway system in proportion to population and resources. On the other\r\nhand, in no country is machinery so extensively used as in the United\r\nStates; and it is precisely that country which contains the fewest\r\nsmall industries in proportion to population and resources. Many of the\r\nsmall industries, too, as Kropotkin admits, are carried on by persons\r\nwho have been displaced by machines, and who have thus been thrown\r\nunemployed on the labor market; or who have drifted into large towns,\r\nespecially into London, because in the country there was no work for\r\nthem. At best the great majority of these people earn but a scanty and\r\nprecarious living; and, judging from the number of hawkers and vendors\r\nwho wander about suburban streets and roads without selling anything,\r\none would imagine that great numbers can scarcely make any living at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when Kropotkin refers to the sweaters’ victims, and to the\r\npeople in country places who make on a small scale clothes or furniture\r\nwhich they dispose of to the dealers in large towns, and so forth, let\r\nit be remembered that so long as human labor is cheaper than machinery\r\nit will be utilized by capitalists in this way. The capitalist uses\r\nor does not use machinery according as it pays or does not pay; and\r\nif he can draw to an unlimited extent on the margin of unemployed\r\nlabor, paying a bare subsistence wage, he will do so, as the evidence\r\ngiven before the House of Lords Committee on Sweating shews. While\r\nadmitting then that a good many small industries exist, and that some\r\nwill continue to exist for an indefinite time, I do not think that\r\nsuch facts make against the general proposition that the tendency is\r\nto large production by machinery, involving the grouping of men and\r\nthe massing of capital, with all the economic and social consequences\r\nthereby involved.\r\n\r\nEven agriculture, that one occupation in which old-fashioned\r\nindividualism might be supposed safe, is being subjected to capitalism.\r\nThe huge farms of Dakota and California, containing single fields\r\nof wheat miles long, are largely owned by joint stock corporations\r\nand cultivated exclusively by machinery. It was the displacement of\r\nhuman labor by machinery on these farms as well as the crises in\r\nmining operations which helped to bring about the phenomenon of an\r\nunemployed class in the richest region of the world, and led Mr.\r\nHenry George to write his “Progress and Poverty.” These huge farms,\r\ncombined with the wheat “corners” in New York and Chicago and the great\r\nrailway corporations of America, have played havoc with many of the\r\nsmall farmers of the Mississippi Valley, as the statistics respecting\r\nmortgaged farms will show. And when it is remembered that the American\r\nfarmer will be more and more obliged to meet the growing competition of\r\nthe wheat of India, produced by the cheapest labor in the world, his\r\nprospect does not appear to be very bright.\r\n\r\nIn order to perceive clearly the immense development of machine\r\nindustry and the consequent displacement of labor, one must resort\r\nto figures, mere rhetoric being of no avail. The following figures\r\nare cited from the United States, because American public statistics\r\nare so much better than British, being both more complete and more\r\naccessible. The facts are taken from the first Annual Report of the\r\nUnited States Commissioner of Labor Statistics in Washington for 1886.\r\nThe Commissioner, inquiring into the industrial crisis, finds that it\r\nis mainly due to the immense development of machine industry under the\r\njoint-stock system; and he takes up various trades one after another\r\nto show how labor has been displaced by machinery. In the timber\r\nbusiness, he says, twelve laborers with a Bucker machine will dress\r\n12,000 staves. The same number of men by hand labor would have dressed\r\nin the same time only 2,500. In the manufacture of paper a machine\r\nnow used for drying and cutting, run by four men and six girls, will\r\ndo the work formerly done by 100 persons, and do it much better. In\r\nthe manufacture of wall-paper the best evidence puts the displacement\r\nin the proportion of a hundred to one. In a phosphate mine in South\r\nCarolina ten men accomplish with machinery what 100 men handle without\r\nit in the same time. There has been a displacement of 50 per cent in\r\nthe manufacture of rubber boots and shoes. In South Carolina pottery\r\nthe product is ten times greater by machine processes than by muscular\r\nlabor. In the manufacture of saws, experienced men consider that there\r\nhas been a displacement of three men out of five. In the weaving of\r\nsilk the displacement has been 95 per cent, and in the winding of silk\r\n90 per cent. A large soap manufacturing concern carefully estimates the\r\ndisplacement of labor in its works at 50 per cent. In making wine in\r\nCalifornia a crushing machine has been introduced with which one man\r\ncan crush and stem 80 tons of grapes in a day, representing an amount\r\nof work formerly requiring eight men. In woollen goods modern machinery\r\nhas reduced muscular labor 33 per cent in the carding department, 50\r\nper cent in the spinning, and 25 per cent in the weaving. In some\r\nkinds of spinning one hundred to one represents the displacement. In\r\nthe whole United States in 1886 the machinery was equal to 3,500,000\r\nhorse power. If men only had been employed, it would have required\r\n21,000,000 to turn out the actual total product: the real number was\r\nfour millions. To do the work accomplished in 1886 in the United\r\nStates by power machinery and on the railways would have required men\r\nrepresenting a population of 172,500,000. The actual population of the\r\nUnited States in 1886 was something under 60,000,000, or a little more\r\nthan one-third.\r\n\r\nCommenting on these very remarkable statistics, the Labor Commissioner\r\nsays: “The apparent evils resulting from the introduction of machinery\r\nand the consequent subdivision of labor have to a large extent, of\r\ncourse, been offset by advantages gained; but it must stand as a\r\npositive statement, which cannot be successfully controverted, that\r\nthis wonderful introduction and extension of power machinery is one\r\nof the prime causes, if not the prime cause, of the novel industrial\r\ncondition in which the manufacturing nations find themselves.” One of\r\nthe results of the “novel industrial condition” in America in 1885, was\r\nan unemployed class variously estimated at from one to two millions\r\nof men, the condition of many of whom as tramps, furnished subjects\r\nfor some very sorry jests to the American press. Such facts as are\r\nhere suggested, will show how a new country may soon be reduced to a\r\ncondition which aggregated capital on the one hand and unemployed labor\r\non the other, render little better than that of an old European State\r\nwith its centuries of misery and oppression. And incidentally they also\r\nshow that such a nostrum as emigration, if intended not as a palliative\r\nbut as a solution, is simply quackery. The inference would seem to\r\nbe irresistible. Just as fast as capitalists find it profitable to\r\nintroduce improved machinery, as fast also will the helplessness of a\r\ngrowing number of the proletariat increase. The “unemployed” question\r\nis the sphinx which will devour us if we cannot answer her riddle.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful expansion of Lancashire perhaps affords the best\r\nillustration of the change from individual to collective industry.\r\nA cotton-mill in one of the dismal “hell-holes,” called towns in\r\nLancashire, is a wonderful place, full of bewildering machines. Here\r\nis a machine called an “opener,” by which 15,000 lbs. of cotton can be\r\nopened in 56 hours. There is a throstle, the spindles of which make\r\nfrom 6,000 to 7,000 revolutions per minute. Here is a man who, with\r\nthe aid of two piecers to take up and join the broken ends, can work\r\n2,000 spindles. Among the distinct separate machines used are opener,\r\nscutcher and lap machine, drawing frame, slubbing frame, intermediate\r\nframe, roving frame, throstle, self-acting mule and hand mule, doubling\r\nframe, and mule doublers or twiners. By means of these appliances\r\nthe following results have been attained. Within eight years, from\r\n1792 to 1800, the quantity of cotton exported from the United States\r\nto Lancashire had increased from 138,000 lbs. to 18,000,000 lbs. In\r\n1801 Lancashire took 84,000 bales of cotton from the United States;\r\nin 1876 she took 2,075,000 bales; and whereas in the former year only\r\n14,000 bales came from India, in 1876 from that country came 775,000\r\nbales, besides a great increase in Brazilian cotton, and a new import\r\nof 332,000 bales from Egypt. In 1805, one million pieces of calico\r\nwere sold in the Blackburn market during the whole year; and that was\r\nconsidered a very large sale. In 1884, according to Ellison’s Annual\r\nReview of the Cotton Trade, there were exported 4,417,000,000 yards of\r\npiece goods besides the vast quantity produced for home consumption.\r\nIn 1875, in place of the little cottages with their hand-looms of\r\na century before, Lancashire contained 2,655 cotton factories with\r\n37,515,772 spinning spindles and 463,118 power looms; and she produced\r\nyarn and piece goods to the weight of 1,088,890,000 lbs. and of the\r\nvalue of £95,447,000. See, too, how through the use of machinery the\r\ncost of production had been lowered. In 1790 the price of spinning the\r\nyarn known technically as No. 100 was 4s. per lb.: in 1826 it had been\r\nreduced to 6¹⁄₂d. The sale price of yarn No. 100 in 1786 was 38s.: in\r\n1793 it was reduced to 15s. 1d., in 1803 to 8s. 4d., in 1876 to 2s.\r\n6d. The decreased cost in each case followed on economy in production,\r\nitself dependent on increased differentiation in machinery; that in\r\nturn involving larger and larger capital, and that again necessitating\r\naggregation and the crushing out of small concerns which could not\r\ncommand machinery or sell at a profit in competition with it.\r\n\r\nSpeculating on the possibility of foreign competition destroying\r\nthe industrial supremacy of Lancashire, Mr. Watts writes in the\r\nEncyclopædia Britannica: “It may perhaps be sufficient to recall to\r\nour readers the small part of the cost of the commodity which now\r\nbelongs to the labor of the hand, and the daily diminution which is\r\ntaking place even of that part, by the introduction of new mechanical\r\nsubstitutes.”[51] Mr. Watts wrote as a expert; and the inference\r\none is compelled to draw from his dictum is that concentration of\r\ncapital and growth of monopoly must continue to develop; and that the\r\n“unemployed” problem must force itself on Lancashire. One who is not\r\nan expert will only venture to criticise with great diffidence Mr.\r\nWatts’s optimistic tone; but it is well to point out that in India\r\ncapitalists can command the cheapest labor in the world--labor too, at\r\npresent entirely unregulated by law. The cotton of India, and also of\r\nAsiatic Russia, is spun and woven near to where it is grown, and where\r\nit can easily command the great Asiatic market. One is not surprised to\r\nfind therefore that the Bombay cotton mills are already giving cause\r\nfor some anxiety in Lancashire; and there seems no rational ground for\r\nsupposing that that anxiety will decrease; in which case the increasing\r\ncompetition would seem to involve in Lancashire either immense\r\ndevelopment of machinery or reduction in wages in order to cheapen\r\nthe cost of production. Either alternative forces the social problem\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nI now pass on to consider the social problem as it has actually been\r\nforced on the attention of the British Government through the new\r\nindustrial conditions.\r\n\r\nThe unrestrained power of capitalism very speedily reduced a large\r\npart of England to a deplorable condition. The Mrs. Jellybys of the\r\nphilanthropic world were busy ministering to the wants of Borioboola\r\nGha by means of tracts and blankets, neither of which were of the\r\nslightest use to those for whom they were intended. But Borioboola Gha\r\nwas an earthly paradise compared with civilized England. There was\r\nnot a savage in the islands of the Pacific who was not better fed,\r\nhappier, healthier, and more contented than the majority of the workers\r\nin the industrial parts of England. Children, it was discovered, were\r\ntransferred in large numbers to the north, where they were housed in\r\npent-up buildings adjoining the factories, and kept to long hours of\r\nlabor. The work was carried on day and night without intermission; so\r\nthat the beds were said never to become cold, inasmuch as one batch\r\nof children rested while another batch went to the looms, only half\r\nthe requisite number of beds being provided for all. Epidemic fevers\r\nwere rife in consequence. Medical inspectors reported the rapid spread\r\nof malformation of the bones, curvature of the spine, heart diseases,\r\nrupture, stunted growth, asthma, and premature old age among children\r\nand young persons: the said children and young persons being worked by\r\nmanufacturers without any kind of restraint. Manufacturing profits in\r\nLancashire were being at the same time reckoned at hundreds and even\r\nthousands per cent. The most terrible condition of things existed in\r\nthe mines, where children of both sexes worked together, half naked,\r\noften for sixteen hours a day. In the fetid passages, children of\r\nseven, six, and even four years of age, were found at work. Women were\r\nemployed underground, many of them even while pregnant, at the most\r\nexhausting labor. After a child was born, its mother was at work again\r\nin less than a week, in an atmosphere charged with sulphuric acid. In\r\nsome places women stood all day knee-deep in water and subject to an\r\nintense heat. One woman when examined avowed that she was wet through\r\nall day long, and had drawn coal carts till her skin came off. Women\r\nand young children of six years old drew coal along the passages of\r\nthe mines, crawling on all fours with a girdle passing round their\r\nwaists, harnessed by a chain between their legs to the cart. A\r\nsub-commissioner in Scotland reported that he “found a little girl,\r\nsix years of age, carrying half a cwt., and making regularly fourteen\r\nlong journeys a day. The height ascended and the distance along the\r\nroad exceeded in each journey the height of St. Paul’s Cathedral.”\r\n“I have repeatedly worked,” said one girl seventeen years of age,\r\n“for twenty-four hours.” The ferocity of the men was worse than that\r\nof wild beasts; and children were often maimed and sometimes killed\r\nwith impunity. Drunkenness was naturally general. Short lives and\r\nbrutal ones were the rule. The men, it was said, “die off like rotten\r\nsheep; and each generation is commonly extinct soon after fifty.”\r\nSuch was a large part of industrial England under the unrestrained\r\nrule of the capitalist. There can be no doubt that far greater misery\r\nprevailed than in the Southern States during the era of slavery. The\r\nslave was property--often valuable property; and it did not pay his\r\nowner to ill-treat him to such a degree as to render him useless as a\r\nwealth-producer. But if the “free” Englishman were injured or killed,\r\nthousands could be had to fill his place for nothing.\r\n\r\nHad this state of things continued we should have returned to a state\r\nof nature with a vengeance. Of man thus depicted we may say with\r\nTennyson:\r\n\r\n            “Dragons of the prime,\r\n  That tare each other in their slime,\r\n  Were mellow music match’d with him.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident that capitalist monopoly must be restrained, reluctant\r\nas English statesmen brought up under the commercial system were to\r\ninterfere. The zenith of _laisser faire_ was at the close of the last\r\ncentury; but a great fabric often looks most imposing shortly before\r\nit begins to collapse. The first piece of labor legislation was the\r\nMorals and Health Act of 1802, which interfered with the accommodation\r\nprovided to children by the employers, to which reference has been\r\nmade. The Cotton Mills Act was passed in 1819, partly owing to the\r\nexertions of Robert Owen. It limited the age at which children\r\nmight work in factories; and it limited the time of their labor to\r\nseventy-two hours per week. Seventy-two hours for a child of nine who\r\nought to have been playing in the green fields! And even that was a\r\nvast improvement on the previous state of things. Saturday labor was\r\nnext shortened by an Act passed by the Radical politician, Sir John\r\nCam Hobhouse, in 1825. Workmen, Radicals, Tories and Philanthropists\r\nthen joined in an agitation under Mr. Richard Oastler, a Conservative\r\nmember of Parliament, to secure a Ten Hours’ Bill. Hobhouse tried by\r\na Bill introduced in 1831 to reduce the time in textile industries;\r\nbut he was beaten by the northern manufacturers. However, Althorp, the\r\nWhig leader, who had helped to defeat Hobhouse, was obliged himself\r\nto introduce a measure by which night work was prohibited to young\r\npersons, and the hours of work were reduced to sixty-nine a week.\r\nCotton-mill owners were at the same time disqualified for acting as\r\njustices in cases of infringement of the law. This measure is regarded\r\nby Dr. E. Von Plener in his useful manual as the first real Factory\r\nAct. Mr. Thomas Sadler, who had succeeded Oastler as leader in the\r\ncause of the factory operatives, brought in a Bill in 1832 limiting the\r\nhours of labor for persons under eighteen; but it was met by a storm of\r\nopposition from manufacturing members and withdrawn.\r\n\r\nTo Sadler succeeded that excellent man, who has perhaps done more for\r\nthe working-classes than any other public man of our time, Lord Ashley,\r\nbetter known as Lord Shaftesbury. And here let me pause to point out\r\nthat it was the Radicals and a large section of the Tories who took\r\nthe side of the operatives against the Whigs, official Conservatives\r\nand manufacturing class. The latter class is sometimes regarded as\r\nLiberal. I think the truth is, that it captured and held for some\r\ntime the Liberal fort, and made Liberalism identical with its policy\r\nand interests. If the men of this class had the cynical candor of\r\nMr. Jay Gould, they might have imitated his reply when examined by a\r\nlegislative committee: “What are your politics, Mr. Gould?” “Well,\r\nin a Republican district I am Republican, in a Democratic district\r\nI am a Democrat; but I am always an Erie Railroad man.” One of Lord\r\nAshley’s strong opponents was Sir Robert Peel, the son of a Lancashire\r\ncapitalist; but the most bitter and persistent was Mr. John Bright.\r\nLord Ashley introduced a Ten Hours’ Bill which included adults. Lord\r\nAlthorp refused to legislate for adults, but himself passed an Act in\r\n1833 prohibiting night work to those under eighteen; fixing forty-eight\r\nhours per week as the maximum for children, and sixty-nine for young\r\npersons; also providing for daily attendance at school, and certain\r\nholidays in the year. As this Act repealed that of 1831, manufacturers\r\nwere again eligible to sit as justices in factory cases; and although\r\nnumerous infractions were reported by inspectors, the offenders in many\r\ncases got off scot free. In 1840 Lord Ashley brought to the notice of\r\nParliament the condition of young people employed in mines; and through\r\nhis activity was passed the first Mining Act, prohibiting underground\r\nwork by women and by boys under ten. Peel then passed a consolidating\r\nFactory Act in 1844. Lord Ashley proposed to restrict to ten per day\r\nthe working hours for young persons; but Peel defeated the proposal by\r\nthreatening to resign if it were carried. By the Act of 1844 the labor\r\nof children was limited to six and a half hours per day; and they had\r\nto attend school three hours daily during the first five days of the\r\nweek. The next year, 1845, Lord Ashley secured the passage of a Bill\r\nforbidding night work to women. In 1847 Mr. Fielden introduced a Bill\r\nlimiting the time of labor for all women and young persons to eleven\r\nhours per day, and after May, 1848, to ten hours. Peel and the factory\r\nowners opposed; but the Bill was carried. The Act of 1850 further\r\nreduced the legal working day for women and young persons; and an Act\r\nof 1853 prohibited the employment of children before 6 A.M. or after 6\r\nP.M. In 1860 bleaching and dyeing works were subjected to the factory\r\nlaws. Further legislation on this branch of industry took place in\r\n1870. A Mines Act was passed in 1860, and made more stringent in 1862\r\nwith reference to safety and ventilation. Acts with reference to the\r\nlace industry were passed in the years 1861-64, to bakehouses in 1863,\r\nchimney-sweeping and pottery works in 1864. The Workshops Regulation\r\nAct, relating to small trades and handicrafts, was passed in 1867, and\r\na consolidating Factory and Workshops Act in 1871. The Act now in force\r\nis the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, modified in respect of certain\r\nindustries by the Act of 1883. Further Acts relative to the regulations\r\nof mines were passed in 1872 and 1887.\r\n\r\nThis brief and imperfect survey of the legislation which has destroyed\r\nthe _régime_ of _laisser faire_ is sufficient for my purpose to\r\nprove: (1) That with private property in the necessary instruments of\r\nproduction, individual liberty as understood by the eighteenth century\r\nreformers must be more and more restricted, _i. e._, that in our\r\nexisting economic condition individualism is impossible and absurd.\r\n(2) That even hostile or indifferent politicians have been compelled\r\nto recognize this. (3) That unrestrained capitalism tends as surely to\r\ncruelty and oppression as did feudalism or chattel slavery. (4) That\r\nthe remedy has been, as a matter of fact, of a Socialistic character,\r\ninvolving collective checking of individual greed and the paring of\r\nslices off the profits of capital in the interests of the working\r\ncommunity. These four propositions can scarcely be contested.\r\n\r\nThe immense development of English industry under the conditions\r\npreviously set forth was due in great degree to the fact that England\r\nhad secured an immense foreign market in which she had for a long time\r\nno formidable rival. Most of the wars in which England was engaged\r\nduring the eighteenth century are quite unintelligible until it is\r\nunderstood that they were commercial wars intended to secure commercial\r\nsupremacy for England. The overthrow of the Stuart monarchy was\r\ndirectly associated with the rise to supreme power of the rich middle\r\nclass, especially the London merchants. The revolution of 1688 marks\r\nthe definite advent to political power of this class, which found\r\nthe Whig party the great instrument for effecting its designs. The\r\ncontrast between the old Tory squire who stood for Church and King,\r\nand the new commercial magnate who stood by the Whigs and the House\r\nof Hanover, is well drawn by Sir Walter Scott in “Rob Roy.” The Banks\r\nof England and Scotland and the National Debt are among the blessings\r\nconferred on their descendants by the new mercantile rulers. They also\r\nbegan the era of corruption in politics which is always connected\r\nclosely with predominance of capitalists in the State, as we see in\r\nFrance, the United States and the British Colonies. “The desire of\r\nthe moneyed classes,” says Mr. Lecky,[52] “to acquire political power\r\nat the expense of the country gentlemen was the first and one of the\r\nchief causes of that political corruption which soon overspread the\r\nwhole system of parliamentary government.” What remained of the old\r\naristocracy often found it convenient to form alliances with the new\r\nplutocracy; and it was this combination which governed England during\r\nthe eighteenth century, and which specially determined her foreign\r\npolicy. That policy was directed towards the securing of foreign\r\nmarkets and the extension of English trade. Napoleon’s sneer at the\r\n“nation of shopkeepers” was not undeserved. The conquest of Canada, the\r\nconquest of India under Clive and Warren Hastings--the latter an agent\r\nof a great capitalist body, who illustrated well in his Indian career\r\nthe methods of his class--the Colonial policy, the base destruction of\r\nIrish manufactures in the interest of English capitalists, were all\r\npart of the same scheme. The policy was successfully consummated in\r\nthe war waged by Pitt against the French Revolution. That revolution\r\nwas itself brought about mainly by poverty. Not only was the French\r\npeasantry beggared; but some of the new machinery which had been\r\nbrought from England had thrown many persons out of work. It was mainly\r\nunemployed workmen who stormed and captured the Bastille.[53] The chief\r\ncounterblast to the Revolution was prepared by Pitt. What were his\r\nmotives? The Austrian and Prussian monarchs, the emigrant nobles, the\r\nimbecile English king and the Tory English bishops may perhaps have\r\nseriously believed that England was fighting for altar and throne. But\r\nPitt was under no such delusion. While he derived from his illustrious\r\nfather a real pride in England, his divinities were rather the ledger\r\nand the cash-box. He was no bigot: even while an undergraduate at\r\nCambridge he was a close student of Adam Smith; he started in public\r\nlife as a reformer, and his refusal to bow to the ignorant prejudices\r\nof George III cost him office in 1801. It has been abundantly proved\r\nthat at first he felt no violent antipathy to the Revolution. A long\r\nperiod elapsed before he was brought to join the monarchical alliance.\r\nBut he was essentially the great capitalist statesman, the political\r\nsuccessor of Walpole, the political predecessor of Peel. He saw that\r\nFrench conquest might threaten seriously the English social fabric, and\r\nthat if England’s chief rival were struck down, the English commercial\r\nclass might gain control of the world’s commerce. To secure that end he\r\nskilfully welded together all the moneyed interests, the contractors,\r\nlandlords, financiers and shopkeepers; and he tried to persuade the\r\nsimpler portion of the country that he was fighting for the sacred\r\ncause of religion and morality. Those who resisted him he flung into\r\nprison or transported beyond the seas. When the long war was brought to\r\nan end, the working-classes were in a wretched condition; although in\r\nthose days also there were sophistical politicians who tried to prove\r\nthat never had the people so much reason to be contented. When, in\r\n1823, the Lancashire weavers petitioned Parliament to look into their\r\ngrievances, an honorable member, who had presumably dined well if\r\nnot wisely, had the audacity to declare that the weavers were better\r\noff than the capitalists--an observation not dissimilar to those we\r\nhave heard in more recent times. As a matter of fact, the landlords,\r\nthrough protection and high rents--the capitalists, through enormous\r\nprofits, were enriched “beyond the dreams of avarice.” But the time\r\nhad come for a conflict between these two classes: the conflict which\r\nis known as the Free Trade controversy. Protection was no longer\r\nneeded by the manufacturers, who had supremacy in the world-market,\r\nunlimited access to raw material, and a long start of the rest of the\r\nworld in the development of machinery and in industrial organization.\r\nThe landlord class, on the other hand, was absolutely dependent on\r\nProtection, because the economic isolation of England by means of\r\nimport duties maintained the high prices of food which were the source\r\nof the high agricultural rents. Capitalist interests, on the contrary,\r\nwere bound up with the interaction between England and the rest of the\r\nworld; and the time had come when the barriers which had prevented that\r\ninteraction must be pulled down. The triumph of Free Trade therefore\r\nsignifies economically the decay of the old landlord class pure and\r\nsimple, and the victory of capitalism. The capitalist class was\r\noriginally no fonder of Free Trade than the landlords. It destroyed in\r\nits own interest the woollen manufacture in Ireland; and it would have\r\nthrottled the trade of the Colonies had it not been for the successful\r\nresistance of Massachusetts and Virginia. It was Protectionist so long\r\nas it suited its purpose to be so. But when cheap raw material was\r\nneeded for its looms, and cheap bread for its workers: when it feared\r\nno foreign competitor, and had established itself securely in India, in\r\nNorth America, in the Pacific; then it demanded Free Trade. “Nothing in\r\nthe history of political imposture,” says Mr. Lecky, “is more curious\r\nthan the success with which, during the Anti-Corn Law agitation, the\r\nnotion was disseminated that on questions of Protection and Free Trade\r\nthe manufacturing classes have been peculiarly liberal and enlightened,\r\nand the landed classes peculiarly selfish and ignorant. It is indeed\r\ntrue that when in the present century the pressure of population\r\non subsistence had made a change in the Corn Laws inevitable, the\r\nmanufacturing classes placed themselves at the head of a Free Trade\r\nmovement from which they must necessarily have derived the chief\r\nbenefit, while the entire risk and sacrifice were thrown upon others.\r\nBut it is no less true that there is scarcely a manufacture in England\r\nwhich has not been defended in the spirit of the narrowest and most\r\njealous monopoly; and the growing ascendancy of the commercial classes\r\nafter the Revolution is nowhere more apparent than in the multiplied\r\nrestrictions of the English Commercial Code.”[54]\r\n\r\nCheap raw material having been secured by the English manufacturer\r\nthrough a series of enactments extending over a generation; and\r\nmachinery having been so developed as to enormously increase\r\nproduction, England sent her textile and metal products all over the\r\nworld; and her manufacturers supported exactly that policy which\r\nenabled them to secure markets for their goods or raw produce to work\r\nup in their mills. Cobdenism was in the ascendant; and the State was\r\nmore and more regarded from the commercial point of view. The so-called\r\n“Manchester school” was in the main a peace party, because war weakens\r\nthat confidence on which commerce is based. But this attachment to\r\npeace principles did not prevent Cobden himself from declaring for a\r\npowerful navy as an instrument of commercial insurance. Nor did it\r\nprevent Manchester from supporting Palmerston’s nefarious Chinese\r\npolicy in 1857, or the equally nefarious aggression in Egypt in 1882:\r\nboth being regarded as helpful to Manchester trade. In behalf of this\r\nextension of English trade to new markets war has been made on China,\r\nEgypt, the Soudan, Burmah, and Thibet. Germany follows England with\r\ncautious tread. Adventurers like Emin, Stanley, and Bartelott are\r\nemployed to “open up” Africa to the gentle influences of civilization\r\nby the agency of rum and revolver, under the pretence of putting down\r\nthe slave trade. France, not to be behind, exploits Tonquin in the\r\ninterests of Paris speculators. An unscrupulous government in Italy\r\nattempts to divert the attention of the country from domestic reforms\r\nto expeditions in Africa in the interests of moneyed people in Europe.\r\nPerhaps the greatest move is yet to come: the move on the vast market\r\nof China. For this England, America, France, and Germany will compete.\r\nTentative steps are already being taken. By her absorption of Burmah\r\nand her operations in Thibet, England is approaching nearer to China.\r\nBy her acquisition of Tonquin, France has been brought into actual\r\ncontact with China. America will probably, by a judicious reduction\r\nof her tariff, compete with England all over the Pacific, and will\r\nsend her goods from the Atlantic ports through the Panama or Nicaragua\r\nCanal of the near future. In short, the machinery for the wholesale\r\nexploitation of Asia and Africa is in rapid progress. The whole globe\r\nwill soon be the private property of the capitalist class.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of the planet has been powerfully aided by the\r\ndevelopments of transport and communication in our time: indeed, it\r\nwould have been impossible without them. The mere application of\r\nmachinery to production could not have produced the economic results\r\nof to-day but for the shrinkage of the globe caused by railways and\r\ntelegraphs. For it is through these inventions that the capitalist\r\nclass has become cosmopolitan, has broken up old habits, destroyed\r\nlocal associations, spared nothing either beautiful or venerable\r\nwhere profit was concerned. It has assimilated the conditions of life\r\nin various lands, and has brought about a general uniformity which\r\naccounts for much of the ennui felt in modern life.\r\n\r\nAs England was the first country to develop machine industry, so\r\nwas she the first to develop railways and to form a powerful steam\r\nmercantile marine. Through the latter agency she has now in her\r\nhands about sixty-four per cent of the carrying trade of the world.\r\nWithin sixty years about 350,000 miles of railway have been built\r\nthroughout the globe. Atlantic and Pacific are united by several\r\nlines of steel; while the locomotive has penetrated remote regions\r\nof Africa inhabited by barbarous tribes, and wastes of central Asia\r\nwhere it confronts the relics of the dead and buried civilizations.\r\nThis immense power, the greatest in the modern world, is mainly in\r\nthe hands of monopolist corporations, among whom there is the same\r\nnecessary tendency to aggregation, only far more marked, as is found\r\nin productive industries. The first small lines built to connect towns\r\nnot far off have been added to others bit by bit; as from the original\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway, less than twenty miles long, we get\r\nthe great and wealthy North Eastern Railway of to-day. In America a\r\nsingle corporation controls as much as 7,000 miles of rail: and the\r\nend of the century will perhaps see the great Siberian Pacific in\r\nactual existence. As in railways, so in steam vessels. Huge fleets\r\nlike the Cunard, the Orient, the Messageries Maritimes, are owned by\r\ncosmopolitan capital, and sustain the traffic and commerce, not of a\r\ncountry, not even of a continent, but of the whole world. Such is the\r\nimmense revolution in the methods of distribution effected in our time\r\nby the operation of capitalism.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider what the term “capitalist” is coming to signify.\r\nHad the term been used half a century ago it would have connoted a\r\nclass, unscrupulous perhaps in the main, with low aims, little culture,\r\nand less fine sympathy or imagination. It was nevertheless a socially\r\nuseful class, which at that time performed real service. It is a\r\nleading thought in modern philosophy that in its process of development\r\neach institution tends to cancel itself. Its special function is born\r\nout of social necessities: its progress is determined by attractions\r\nor repulsions which arise in society, producing a certain effect which\r\ntends to negate the original function. Thus early society among the\r\nAryan peoples of Europe develops a leader in war or council who grows,\r\nby processes which in England, _e. g._, can be clearly traced, into a\r\nking with genuine functions, a leader of the people in war like William\r\nI, or a powerful civil ruler and statesman like Henry I. The fact that\r\nsuch men were brutal or wicked is of little account: the important\r\nfact about them is, that in a barbarous chaotic society they performed\r\nsome indispensable services. But the very putting forth of the kingly\r\npower arouses antagonism; then produces armed resistance by a combined\r\ngroup; and finally leads to overthrow either by the destruction of the\r\nking or by depriving him of all real power and reducing him to a mere\r\nornamental puppet. The very power originally believed to be beneficent\r\nbecomes tyrannical: it needs to be checked more and more, until finally\r\nit practically ceases to exist, and the curious paradox is seen of a\r\nmonarch who does not rule. History proves abundantly that men do not\r\nrise and overthrow wicked and corrupt rulers merely because they are\r\nwicked and corrupt. It is part of the terrible irony of history that\r\na Louis XV dies in his bed, while a William the Silent or a Lincoln\r\nfalls a victim to the assassin. What men do not long tolerate is either\r\nobstructiveness or uselessness.\r\n\r\nNow, if we apply these ideas to the evolution of the capitalist,\r\nwhat is it we see? The capitalist was originally an _entrepreneur_,\r\na manager who worked hard at his business, and who received what\r\neconomists have called the “wages of superintendence.” So long as\r\nthe capitalist occupied that position, he might be restrained and\r\ncontrolled in various ways; but he could not be got rid of. His “wages\r\nof superintendence” were certainly often exorbitant; but he performed\r\nreal functions; and society, as yet unprepared to take those functions\r\nupon itself, could not afford to discharge him. Yet, like the King, he\r\nhad to be restrained by the legislation already referred to; for his\r\npower involved much suffering to his fellows. But now the capitalist is\r\nfast becoming absolutely useless. Finding it easier and more rational\r\nto combine with others of his class in a large undertaking, he has\r\nnow abdicated his position of overseer, has put in a salaried manager\r\nto perform his work for him, and has become a mere rent or interest\r\nreceiver. The rent or interest he receives is paid for the use of a\r\nmonopoly which not he, but a whole multitude of people, created by\r\ntheir joint efforts.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that this differentiation of manager and capitalist\r\nshould arise. It is part of the process of capitalist evolution due\r\nto machine industry. As competition led to waste in production, so it\r\nled to the cutting of profits among capitalists. To prevent this the\r\nmassing of capital was necessary, by which the large capitalists could\r\nundersell his small rivals by offering, at prices below anything they\r\ncould afford to sell at, goods produced by machinery and distributed\r\nby a plexus of agencies initially too costly for any individual\r\ncompetitor to purchase or set on foot. Now for such massive capitals,\r\nthe contributions of several capitalists are needed; and hence has\r\narisen the Joint Stock Company or _Compagnie Anonyme_. Through this new\r\ncapitalist agency a person in England can hold stock in an enterprise\r\nat the Antipodes which he has never visited and never intends to\r\nvisit, and which, therefore, he cannot “superintend” in any way. He\r\nand the other shareholders put in a manager with injunctions to be\r\neconomical. The manager’s business is to earn for his employers the\r\nlargest dividends possible: if he does not do so he is dismissed. The\r\nold personal relation between the workers and the employer is gone;\r\ninstead thereof remains merely the cash nexus. To secure high dividends\r\nthe manager will lower wages. If that is resisted there will probably\r\nbe either a strike or lock-out. Cheap labor will be perhaps imported by\r\nthe manager; and if the work-people resist by intimidation or organized\r\nboycotting, the forces of the State (which they help to maintain) will\r\nbe used against them. In the majority of cases they must submit.\r\nSuch is a not unfair picture of the relation of capitalist to workman\r\nto-day: the former having become an idle dividend-receiver. The dictum\r\nof orthodox political economy, uttered by so competent an authority as\r\nthe late Professor Cairnes, runs:--\r\n\r\n “It is important, on moral no less than on economic grounds, to\r\n insist upon this, that no public benefit of any kind arises from the\r\n existence of an idle rich class. The wealth accumulated by their\r\n ancestors and others on their behalf, where it is employed as capital,\r\n no doubt helps to sustain industry; but what they consume in luxury\r\n and idleness is not capital, and helps to sustain nothing but their\r\n own unprofitable lives. By all means they must have their rents and\r\n interest, as it is written in the bond; but let them take their proper\r\n place as drones in the hive, gorging at a feast to which they have\r\n contributed nothing.”[55]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the modern capitalist may be not only useless but\r\npositively obstructive was well illustrated at a meeting of the\r\nshareholders of the London and South Western Railway on 7th February\r\nlast. Three shareholders urged a reduction in third-class fares. The\r\nchairman pointed out the obvious fact that such a reduction would\r\nprobably lower the dividend, and asked the meeting if that was what\r\nthey wished. He was, of course, answered by a chorus of “No, no!” and\r\nall talk of reduction of fares was at an end. Here is a plain sample\r\n(hundreds might be quoted) of the evident interests of the public being\r\nsacrificed to those of the capitalist.\r\n\r\nThat joint-stock capitalism is extending rapidly everyone knows. In\r\nthe United States, according to Mr. Bryce, the wealth of joint-stock\r\ncorporations is estimated at one-fourth of the total value of all\r\nproperty.[56] In England every kind of business, from breweries, banks,\r\nand cotton-mills down to automatic sweetmeat machines, is falling into\r\nthe hands of the joint-stock capitalist, and must continue to do so.\r\nTwenty years ago who would have supposed that a brewery like that of\r\nGuinness or such a banking firm as Glyn Mills, and Co. would become\r\na joint-stock company? Yet we know it is so to-day. Capitalism is\r\nbecoming impersonal and cosmopolitan. And the combinations controlling\r\nproduction become larger and fewer. Baring’s are getting hold of the\r\nSouth African diamond fields: A few companies control the whole\r\nanthracite coal produce of Pennsylvania. Each one of us is quite “free”\r\nto “compete” with these gigantic combinations, as the Principality of\r\nMonaco is “free” to go to war with France should the latter threaten\r\nher interests. The mere forms of freedom remain; but monopoly renders\r\nthem nugatory. The modern State, having parted with the raw material\r\nof the globe, cannot secure freedom of competition to its citizens;\r\nand yet it was on the basis of free competition that capitalism rose.\r\nThus we see that capitalism has cancelled its original principle--is\r\nitself negating its own existence. Before considering its latest\r\nforms, attention may here be conveniently directed to the Co-operative\r\nmovement, which is, on one side at any rate, closely allied to the\r\njoint-stock development.\r\n\r\nThe Co-operative movement had in England a Socialistic origin: for\r\nits founder was Robert Owen. As Mr. Seligman says very truly in\r\nthe _Political Science Quarterly_: “Owen was the founder of the\r\nCo-operative movement in England, a fact often ignored by those who\r\nglibly use the word to-day with an utter failure to discern its\r\ntrue significance.” And Owen himself avowed that his grand ultimate\r\nobject was “community in land,” with which he hoped would be combined\r\n“unrestrained co-operation on the part of all, for every purpose of\r\nhuman life.” It is thus important to associate co-operation with Robert\r\nOwen--_clarum et venerabile nomen_--because there are many persons who\r\nsuppose that co-operation began with the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844.\r\nWhat the Rochdale movement really did was to commence the process of\r\njoint-stock shop-keeping, a very different thing from that which Owen\r\nhad in view.\r\n\r\nA powerful impetus was given to co-operation by the Christian Socialist\r\nmovement under Maurice and Kingsley. “Of all narrow, conceited,\r\nhypocritical, anarchic and atheistic schemes of the Universe,” said\r\nKingsley, “The Cobden and Bright one is exactly the worst.” The\r\northodox economic conclusions of the day fared badly at Kingsley’s\r\nhands. “The man who tells us,” said he, “that we ought to investigate\r\nNature, simply to sit patiently under her, and let her freeze, and\r\nruin, and starve, and stink us to death, is a goose, whether he\r\ncalls himself a chemist or a political economist.” These Christian\r\nSocialist leaders felt deeply the anguish and poverty of the workers\r\nand the selfish apathy of the rich. “Mammon,” says Kingsley, “shrieks\r\nbenevolently whenever a drunken soldier is flogged; but he trims his\r\npaletot and adorns his legs with the flesh of men and the skins of\r\nwomen, with degradation, pestilence, heathendom, and despair; and then\r\nchuckles complacently over his tailor’s bills. Hypocrite! straining\r\nat a gnat and swallowing a camel.” All this is very admirable; but\r\ncheap clothes are not made solely or chiefly for Mammon, but for\r\nthe masses, who are poor people. It is part of the sad irony of the\r\nsituation that the great majority are obliged to accept the alternative\r\nof cheap clothes or none at all. And as the English climate and the\r\nBritish matron combine to exercise an absolute veto over the latter\r\nform of prehistoric simplicity, it follows that one portion of the\r\nworking-classes must, in order to be clothed, connive at the sweating\r\nof another portion.\r\n\r\nThe _Christian Socialist_, which was the organ of Maurice and\r\nKingsley, betrayed great simplicity as to the real nature of the\r\neconomic problem. It neglected Owen’s principle of “community in\r\nland,” and supposed that by working together and selling articles\r\nof good quality at a fair price poverty could be eliminated, while\r\nyet every worker in the community was paying his tribute of economic\r\nrent to the owners of the instruments of production. Thus the\r\nmovement had no economic basis; and when the moral idealism had\r\ndeparted from it, no wonder that it degenerated into mere “divvy”\r\nhunting and joint-stock shop-keeping. The economic advantages of\r\njoint-stock shop-keeping are thus summed up by Mr. Robert Somers in\r\nthe “Encyclopædia Britannica” (Art., “Co-operation”): “Wholesome\r\ncommodities, ready-money payments, a dividend of from five to ten\r\nper cent on share capital, and a bonus to non-members on the amount\r\nof their purchases.” As joint-stock shop-keeping, co-operation is a\r\nuseful and cheap method of distribution, which has doubtless benefited\r\na considerable number of persons; but the notion that it can solve the\r\neconomic problem before society is “chimerical,” as Dr. J. K. Ingram\r\ntells us is the opinion of modern economists.[57] This, indeed, might\r\nonly be expected from the fact that 961 out of every 1,000 persons\r\nin England die without furniture, investments, or effects worth\r\n£300.[58] Economically considered, co-operation is, now that the\r\ninitial enthusiasm has died out of it, a subsidiary branch of the great\r\njoint-stock enterprise. Ethically considered, its results are often\r\ndoubtful. In its chief stronghold, Lancashire, one observes a narrow\r\nselfishness among its votaries, which could not be surpassed in the\r\nmost genteel quarters of Bayswater. Its ideal is not the raising of\r\nthe working class as a whole, but the raising of certain persons out\r\nof the working into the middle class. If the advocates of co-operation\r\nwill abate their pretensions, and claim merely (1) that their method\r\nis a useful and economic means of distribution among the lower-middle\r\nand upper-working classes; and (2) that by its agency working men can\r\nlearn the important functions of organization and administration, their\r\nclaim will be freely admitted. But if they go further their vaulting\r\nambition will o’erleap itself. At the present rate of progress made\r\nby co-operative societies as compared with joint-stock capitalist\r\ncompanies, several generations will be in their graves before any deep\r\nor general impression is made. And meanwhile, unless economic rent is\r\ndiverted from the class which at present absorbs it to the community\r\nwhich creates it, co-operators, like the rest of us, must pay tribute\r\nto the lords of the soil and of money. But the noteworthy fact about\r\nco-operation, is that its very existence testifies to the process of\r\nindustrial and capitalist aggregation here insisted on as the great\r\nsocial factor of our period. For co-operative societies supersede\r\nindividual by social distribution, effecting it without the waste\r\nattendant on a number of little shops all competing against each other,\r\nthe owners of none of which can make a decent living. Co-operation,\r\ntherefore, well illustrates the economic evolution of the present age.\r\n\r\nI now come to treat of the latest forms of capitalism, the “ring” and\r\nthe “trust,” whereby capitalism cancels its own principles, and, as a\r\nseller, replaces competition by combination. When capitalism buys labor\r\nas a commodity it effects the purchase on the competitive principle.\r\nIts indefinitely extended market enables it to do so; for it knows\r\nthat the workman must sell his labor to secure the means to live.\r\nOther things being equal, therefore, it buys its labor in the cheapest\r\nmarket. But when it turns round to face the public as a seller, it\r\ncasts the maxims of competition to the winds, and presents itself as\r\na solid combination. Competition, necessary at the outset, is found\r\nultimately, if unchecked, to be wasteful and ruinous. It entails\r\ngreat expense in advertising; it necessitates the employment of much\r\nunproductive labor; it tends to the indefinite lowering of prices; it\r\nproduces gluts and crises, and renders business operations hazardous\r\nand precarious. To escape these consequences, the competing persons or\r\nfirms agree to form a close combination to keep up prices, to augment\r\nprofits, to eliminate useless labor, to diminish risk, and to control\r\nthe output. This is a “ring,” which is thus a federation of companies.\r\nThe best examples of “rings” and “pools” are to be found in America,\r\nwhere capitalism is more unrestrained and bolder in its operations than\r\nin Europe; and also where nearly all the active intellect is attracted\r\nto those commercial pursuits that dominate American life.\r\n\r\nThe individualist devotees of _laisser faire_ used to teach us\r\nthat when restrictions were removed, free competition would settle\r\neverything. Prices would go down, and fill the “consumer” with joy\r\nunspeakable; the fittest would survive; and as for the rest--it was\r\nnot very clear what would become of them, and it really didn’t matter.\r\nNo doubt the “consumer” has greatly benefited by the increase in\r\nproduction and the fall in prices; but where is “free competition”\r\nnow? Almost the only persons still competing freely are the small\r\nshopkeepers, trembling on the verge of insolvency, and the workingmen,\r\ncompeting with one another for permission to live by work. Combination\r\nis absorbing commerce. Here are a few instances of the formation of\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nA steel rail combination was some years ago formed among previously\r\ncompeting firms in America. This combination discovered that too many\r\nrails were being made and that prices were being cut. Accordingly, one\r\nof the mills in the combination--the Vulcan mill of St. Louis--was\r\nclosed, and stood smokeless for years: its owners meanwhile receiving a\r\nsubsidy of $400,000 a year from the other mills in the combination for\r\n_not_ making rails. That is how the owners of the Vulcan mill earned\r\ntheir “wages of superintendence.” It is needless to add that no payment\r\nwas made to the men for _not_ working: they were thrown on the streets\r\nto meditate on the right to “liberty and the pursuit of happiness,”\r\nsecured to them by the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nOr, again, take the case of the anthracite coal lands of Pennsylvania,\r\noccupying an area of some 270,000 acres, and held by the Reading\r\nCoal and Iron Company, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Delaware,\r\nLackawanna and Western Railroad, the Delaware and Hudson Railroad,\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, the Pennsylvania Coal Company, and smaller\r\nfirms and corporations tributary to these. The rich owners, popularly\r\nknown as the “coal barons,” agree to fix absolutely the wholesale price\r\nof coal, always securing an immense rise just before the winter sets\r\nin. There is no such thing known or possible as free trade or open\r\ncompetition in the anthracite coal produce of America.\r\n\r\nCombinations in the United States have been made by the Western\r\nmillers, the New York icemen, Boston fish dealers, manufacturers of\r\nsewer-pipe, copper miners, makers of lamps, pottery, glass, hoop-iron,\r\nshot, rivets, candy, starch, sugar, preserved fruits, glucose, chairs,\r\nvapor stoves, lime, rubber, screws, chains, harvesting machinery, pins,\r\nsalt, hardware, type, brass tubing, silk and wire. In these trades\r\nfreedom of production and sale has been for a time partially or wholly\r\ndestroyed. The American business man is very angry when boycotting\r\nis resorted to by workmen; but he is quite ready to boycott others\r\nwhen his interests lead that way. The stamped tinware makers in 1882,\r\nformed a ring and expelled members who sold at lower prices than the\r\nfixed rates, and refused to allow anyone in the pool to sell to the\r\noffenders. Some of the previous facts are taken from an article by Mr.\r\nHenry D. Lloyd,[59] who has investigated capitalist combinations with\r\nmuch knowledge and insight. From the same article I quote the following:\r\n\r\n “On the 1st of April, 1882, when the rest of us were lost in the\r\n reckless gaity of All Fools’ Day, forty-one tack manufacturers\r\n found out that there were too many tacks, and formed the Central\r\n Manufacturing Company of Boston, with 3,000,000 dollars capital. The\r\n tack-mills in the combination ran about three days in the week. When\r\n this combination a few weeks ago silenced a Pittsburg rival by buying\r\n him out, they did not remove the machinery. The dead chimneys and idle\r\n machines will discourage new men from starting another factory, or can\r\n be run to ruin them if they are not to be discouraged in any other\r\n way. The first fruits of the tack-pool were an increase of prices to\r\n twice what they had been.”\r\n\r\nAgain I quote Mr. Lloyd:\r\n\r\n “The men who make our shrouds and coffins have formed a close\r\n corporation known as the ‘National Burial Case Association,’ and held\r\n their annual convention in Chicago last year. Their action to keep up\r\n prices and keep down the number of coffins was secret, lest mortality\r\n should be discouraged.”\r\n\r\nFrom coffins to crackers is a short step in the study of capitalist\r\nmethods:\r\n\r\n “The Western Cracker Bakers’ Association met in Chicago, in February,\r\n to consider among other things ‘the reprehensible system of cutting\r\n prices’ (_i. e._, the reprehensible system of free competition which\r\n capitalists in buying labor tell us is our salvation). They first had\r\n a banquet. After their ‘merriment and diversion’ the revellers, true\r\n to Adam Smith’s description, turned to consider ‘some contrivance to\r\n raise prices.’ ‘The price-lists were perfected,’ said the newspaper\r\n report; ‘and then they adjourned.’”\r\n\r\nIn 1875 broke out a severe competition among the fire insurance\r\ncompanies, upon the collapse of a previous pool; and the competition\r\ncost them in New York City alone $17,500,000 in seven years.\r\nConsequently in 1882 they made a new combination which covered the\r\nwhole country, and which Mr. Lloyd declares to be wealthy, cohesive,\r\nand powerful. Though there is no pool or ring, I am credibly informed\r\nthat there is a common understanding among the fire insurance companies\r\nof London. One of the most noted of combinations has been the great\r\nCopper Syndicate which attracted world-wide attention early in 1888.\r\nIt was formed by some French speculators in October, 1887, and during\r\nthe eighteen months of its existence, maintained copper at a purely\r\narbitrary price in all the markets of the world. At its head was M.\r\nEugène Secretan, managing director of the Société des Métaux, the\r\nworld’s largest buyer of, and dealer in, manufactured copper. The\r\nsyndicate’s agents bought all the copper that was visible and for\r\nsale, the result of their speculation being that the price of copper\r\nin the London market rose from less than £40 to over £80 a ton, and\r\nthe price of Lake Superior copper in America rose from 10¹⁄₂ cents to\r\n17³⁄₄ cents per pound. M. Secretan informed a London journal that his\r\ndesigns were purely philanthropic. “Our only purpose,” said he, “is\r\nthat every miner, dealer and manufacturer should have fair remuneration\r\nfor his work.” Thanks to M. Secretan’s philanthropy, copper, tin, lead\r\nand spelter rose enormously in price; several trades were more or\r\nless paralysed; and in France large numbers of workmen were thrown\r\nout of employment. And let it not be supposed that the suicide of M.\r\nDenfert-Rochereau, which heralded the collapse of this first attempt\r\nto corner the world’s copper--a collapse due to a miscalculation of\r\nthe extent to which the supply of copper could increase under the\r\nstimulus of high prices--offers us any security against a repetition\r\nof the attempt. On the contrary, it has shewn how the thing may be\r\nsafely done. The metal hoarded by the unlucky speculators is still so\r\nfar cornered that it has been kept off the market up to the present,\r\nprices being not yet normal. “To a regular trust it must and will come\r\nat last,” says Mr. E. Benjamin Andrews, of Cornell University. “Nor\r\nhas aught taken place to indicate that a Copper Trust, organized like\r\nthe Standard Oil Trust, with its energy and relentless methods, would\r\nfail.”[60]\r\n\r\nThe Individualist who supposes that Free Trade plus private property\r\nwill solve all economic problems is naturally surprised at these\r\n“rings,” which upset all his crude economic notions; and he very\r\nillogically asks for legislation to prevent the natural and inevitable\r\nresults of the premises with which he starts. It is amusing to note\r\nthat those who advocate what they call self-reliance and self-help are\r\nthe first to call on the State to interfere with the natural results of\r\nthat self-help, of that private enterprise, when it has overstepped a\r\npurely arbitrary limit. Why, on ordinary commercial principles, should\r\nnot a copper syndicate grasp all the copper in the world? It is merely\r\nthe fittest surviving. The whole case against Socialism is assumed by\r\nits most intelligent opponents to lie in that Darwinian theory. And yet\r\nwhen the copper syndicate or the “coal barons” survive, they arouse\r\nagainst themselves the fiercest and, from the commercial point of view,\r\nthe most unreasonable antagonism. As sin when it is finished is said\r\nto bring forth death, so capitalism when it is finished brings forth\r\nmonopoly. And one might as well quarrel with that plain fact as blame\r\nthorns because they do not produce grapes, or thistles because they are\r\nbarren of figs.\r\n\r\nThe story of the growth of capitalism is not yet complete. The\r\n“ring” is being succeeded by a more elaborate organization known as\r\nthe “trust.” Although in England great combinations like the Salt\r\nUnion are rapidly rising, yet we must again travel to America to\r\nlearn what the so-called “trust” is. The fullest information on the\r\nsubject of trusts is contained in a report of a Committee of the New\r\nYork State Legislature, which was appointed to investigate the new\r\ncombination. The following trusts were inquired into: Sugar, milk,\r\nrubber, cotton-seed oil, envelope, elevator, oil-cloth, Standard oil,\r\nbutchers’, glass, and furniture. A trust is defined by the Committee as\r\na combination “to destroy competition and to restrain trade through the\r\nstockholders therein combining with other corporations or stockholders\r\nto form a joint-stock company of corporations, in effect renouncing\r\nthe powers of such several corporations, and placing all powers in the\r\nhands of trustees.” The general purposes and effects are stated to\r\nbe “to control the supply of commodities and necessities; to destroy\r\ncompetition; to regulate the quality; and to keep the cost to the\r\nconsumer at prices far beyond their fair and equitable value.” It\r\nis unnecessary to deal with all these trusts, which possess certain\r\nfeatures in common. I will select one or two, particularly the great\r\nStandard Oil Trust and the Cotton-seed Oil Trust.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil Trust is probably the largest single business\r\nmonopoly in the world, the value of all its included interests being\r\nestimated, according to the evidence submitted, at £29,600,000. In the\r\nreport it is described as “one of the most active and possibly the\r\nmost formidable monied power on this continent. Its influence reaches\r\ninto every State, and is felt in remote villages; and the products of\r\nits refineries seek a market in almost every seaport on the globe.”\r\nThe germ of this huge monopoly was a small petroleum refinery near\r\nCleveland, bought by one Rockefeller, a book-keeper in a store, and a\r\nfriend of his, a porter, with borrowed money. Rockefeller formed an\r\nacquaintance with a rich whiskey distiller, who advanced money and\r\nput his son-in-law Flagler into the business. This person’s doctrines\r\nare thus described: “He says that there is no damned sentiment about\r\nbusiness; that he knows no friendship in trade; and that if he gets\r\nhis business rival in a hole he means to keep him there.” Such a man\r\nis eminently fitted to be the founder of a monopoly: he is a hero of\r\nself-help; for he helps himself to anything he can lay his hands on.\r\nA second refinery was established in Ohio, and a warehouse opened in\r\nNew York. The concern grew, and was incorporated as the Standard Oil\r\nCompany. It is charged with having secured special legislation by\r\njudicious expenditure in the lobbies of the Ohio and Pennsylvania\r\nLegislatures. By entering into arrangements with the trunk railway\r\nlines, it secured special rates for transit. New refineries were\r\nestablished and new oil lands in Pennsylvania acquired; the capital\r\nwas increased; and an enormous yearly business was done. After a time\r\nthe company controlled every avenue of transportation; managed all\r\nthe largest refineries in the land; and was able to shut off every\r\ncompetitor from either receiving supplies or shipping its products.\r\nNew companies, nominally distinct, but all under the control of the\r\nsame men, were incorporated in New Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia and\r\nother States. The monopoly elected one of its chief stockholders\r\ninto the United States Senate, it is said, through bribery in the\r\nOhio Legislature over which body it certainly acquired strong hold.\r\nThese tactics were known as “coal oil politics.” All the dirty work\r\nwas, of course, done through agents, the directors pretending perfect\r\ninnocence. In 1882 the Standard Oil Companies were consolidated in the\r\nStandard Oil Trust.[61] The stockholders surrendered their stock to the\r\ntrustees, nine in number, created under the agreement, and received\r\ncertificates in the place thereof, the representatives of the trust\r\nand the stockholders in the refineries making a joint valuation of the\r\nrefineries, and the certificates being issued to that amount. Thus the\r\nseparate concerns were merged in one gigantic business, controlled by\r\nnine men (owning a majority of the stock), having a monopoly of nearly\r\nall the oil lands in America, controlling legislative votes, forming a\r\nsolid alliance with the railway and shipping interests, and determining\r\nto a gallon how much oil shall be produced and refined, and to a\r\nfraction of a cent what shall be its price. In 1887 there was a cash\r\ndividend of 10 per cent. declared, besides a stock dividend of 20 per\r\ncent. on the certificates of four years’ aggregation. In addition to\r\nthe enormous stock they hold, the trustees receive an annual salary of\r\n£5,000. What are the economic results of this combination? It has not\r\nraised prices, as the trusts were charged by the committee with doing.\r\nOn the contrary there has been a steady decrease in price during the\r\ndecade 1877-1887. The consumption of oil has also enormously increased.\r\nThe working and producing expenses have been greatly lowered by the\r\ndismissal of needless labor and vast improvements in machinery; the\r\npipe lines controlled by the trust having displaced 5,700 teams of\r\nhorses and 11,400 men in handling the oil. Thus of this trust we may\r\nsay that though the means used to establish it were morally doubtful or\r\neven bad, the political results disastrous, the economic results have\r\nbeen beneficial, except in the matter of helping to form an unemployed\r\nclass through the dismissal of needless labor consequent on the\r\ndevelopment of machinery.\r\n\r\nThe Cotton-seed Oil Trust was organized two or three years ago in the\r\nState of Arkansas.[62] Upwards of seventy different companies had been\r\ncompeting with each other and consequently suffering heavy losses.\r\nTheir mills being comparatively small and equipped with imperfect\r\nmachinery, they were glad to combine; and those that did not were\r\nforced to close. The seventy corporations, the vast majority of the\r\nmembers of which had agreed to the combination, surrendered their stock\r\nto a body of trustees and received in return $100 certificates. The\r\nvarious mills send a monthly report to the trust; and if the officers\r\nin a given mill do not sell at the terms imposed, they are dismissed\r\nby the trust.[63] The object of the trust was declared by a witness\r\nto be to prevent bankruptcy, to improve methods, to find markets, to\r\ndevelop the enterprise and to make money. The economic result has been\r\ndisplacement of labor by the machinery and great economy in production.\r\nIncidentally it came out that much cotton-seed oil was sold to the\r\nFrench and Italian buyers, who mix it with a little olive oil and\r\nexport it back to America and to England, where a confiding public\r\npurchases it as pure Tuscan olive oil--an interesting illustration of\r\ninternational trade morality.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the milk and butchers’ trust ought to be a revelation\r\nto those who imagine that trade is “free,” and that competition rules.\r\nOn April 29th, 1885, the directors of the Milk Exchange met in New York\r\nand unanimously resolved:\r\n\r\n “That on the first day of May next, and until otherwise ordered,\r\n the market price of milk produced from meadow hay and sound cereals\r\n be 2¹⁄₂ cents per quart, and that produced from brewers’ grains and\r\n glucose and corn starch refuse be 2 cents per quart.”[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nA representative of the Sheep and Lamb Butchers’ Mutual Benefit\r\nAssociation testified that the members of that body agreed that they\r\nwould only buy sheep and calves from the Sheep Brokers’ Association,\r\na penalty for violation of this rule being imposed at the rate of 15\r\ncents a head per sheep or calf. The absolute despotism, and the system\r\nof espionage involved in such regulation is obvious. Here is a copy of\r\na document issued by this body:\r\n\r\n “New York, January 9, 1888. Permission has been granted by the board\r\n of trustees of this association to Simon Strauss to buy sheep and\r\n lambs in New York markets, providing he buys no sheep and lambs from\r\n outsiders, under penalty of 15 cents per head fine. Richard S. Tobin,\r\n Secretary.”[65]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the Association relaxed. On November 5th, 1887, according\r\nto its minutes,\r\n\r\n “The application of John Healey, No. 2, to be granted the privilege of\r\n buying a few sheep and lambs without the 15 cents being charged to the\r\n brokers, was favorably acted upon.”\r\n\r\nThis is not a record of Bagdad under the caliphs, but of the Republican\r\nState of New York! The threatened despotism of Socialism has been often\r\neloquently dwelt on; but what of the actual despotism of to-day?\r\n\r\nNow what does this examination of trusts show? That, granted private\r\nproperty in the raw material out of which wealth is created on a huge\r\nscale by the new inventions which science has placed in our hands, the\r\nultimate effect must be the destruction of that very freedom which\r\nthe modern democratic State posits as its first principle. Liberty to\r\ntrade, liberty to exchange products, liberty to buy where one pleases,\r\nliberty to transport one’s goods at the same rate and on the same terms\r\nenjoyed by others, subjection to no _imperium in imperio_: these surely\r\nare all fundamental democratic principles. Yet by monopolies every one\r\nof them is either limited or denied. Thus capitalism is apparently\r\ninconsistent with democracy as hitherto understood. The development\r\nof capitalism and that of democracy cannot proceed without check on\r\nparallel lines. Rather are they comparable to two trains approaching\r\neach other from different directions on the same line. Collision\r\nbetween the opposing forces seems inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut both democracy and the new capitalist combinations which threaten\r\nit are inevitable growths of an evolutionary process. We are therefore\r\nbrought to consider the question whether the ring, syndicate, or trust\r\neither can or ought to be destroyed. These combinations can be shown to\r\nbe the most economical and efficient methods of organizing production\r\nand exchange. They check waste, encourage machinery, dismiss useless\r\nlabor, facilitate transport, steady prices, and raise profits--i.e.,\r\nthey best effect the objects of trade from the capitalist’s point\r\nof view. Now, the opponents of Socialism say that without this\r\nenterprising capitalist we cannot live. He “provides employment,” they\r\nsay. Well, if we need him, we must obviously pay his price. If he has\r\na natural monopoly of a function indispensable to social progress,\r\nsociety must concede the terms he imposes. These terms are briefly\r\nlarge combinations of capitalist ownership. In this way he can best\r\norganize business; if we do not choose to let him do it in this way,\r\nhe will not do it for us at all. From his point of view that is a fair\r\nposition to take up; and it places the Individualist opponent of trusts\r\nin an awkward dilemma. For he must either submit to trusts or give up\r\ncapitalists, in which latter case he becomes a Socialist. The answer of\r\nSocialism to the capitalist is that society can do without him, just\r\nas society now does without the slave-owner or feudal lord, both of\r\nwhom were formerly regarded as necessary to the well-being and even the\r\nvery existence of society. In organizing its own business for itself,\r\nsociety can employ, at whatever rate of remuneration may be needed to\r\ncall forth their powers, those capitalists who are skilled organizers\r\nand administrators. But those who are mere dividend-receivers will no\r\nlonger be permitted to levy a contribution on labor, but must earn\r\ntheir living by useful industry as other and better people have to do.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that society is not yet ripe for this transformation,\r\nnor is it. The forms of the democratic State are not yet perfected, nor\r\nhas the economic evolution yet proceeded generally far enough, even in\r\nEngland, not to speak of the less advanced European countries. Much yet\r\nremains to be done through both the education of the intellect and the\r\ndevelopment of a nobler public spirit. But on the other hand we seem\r\nto be rapidly approaching such an _impasse_ that some very large and\r\ndefinite extension of collective authority must be made. This would\r\nseem to involve on one side general reduction of the hours of labor,\r\nand on the other an attempt to absorb by the community a portion of\r\nthose social values which it creates. In reference to ground values it\r\nmay be anticipated that local democratic authorities will secure them\r\nfor the benefit of the people by any means which may be found expedient.\r\n\r\nAs regards the great combinations of capital, State action may take\r\none of three courses. It may prohibit and dissolve them; it may tax\r\nand control them; or it may absorb and administer them. In either\r\ncase the Socialist theory is _ipso facto_ admitted, for each is a\r\nconfession that it is well to exercise a collective control over\r\nindustrial capital. If the first of these courses is taken a distinctly\r\nretrogressive policy is definitely adopted, a policy of alarm at what\r\nMr. Cleveland called the “communism of capital,” a policy of reversion\r\nto the chaos of “free competition,” and of cession of the undoubted\r\nbenefits which combination has secured. Such a policy would signify the\r\nforcible prevention of acquisition of property, the very thing dearest\r\nto the Individualist. If the powers of acquisition, now evidently\r\ndependent on combination, are to be restricted, what becomes of the\r\n“incentive to industry,” the “reward of abstinence,” and all the rest\r\nof the worn out phrases which have so often done duty in the place\r\nof argument? If the syndicate or the trust represents the legitimate\r\noutcome of capitalism--if it is necessary to give order to trade and\r\nto prevent the ruinous waste of unrestricted competition, how absurd\r\nit is for the State to say to the capitalist: “You shall carry your\r\nprivileges of acquisition just up to the point where competition is\r\nlikely to ruin you; but there you shall stop. Immediately you and\r\nyour friends combine to prevent waste, to regulate production and\r\ndistribution, to apply new methods of manufacture, we shall absolutely\r\nprevent you or restrain you by vexatious regulations.” To which the\r\ncapitalist may be supposed to reply: “I cannot fulfil my function in\r\nsociety at this serious risk. I shall never know security--never be\r\neven moderately sure of reaping that reward to which I am admittedly\r\nentitled. If you intend to fetter my action in this way after having\r\nproclaimed me free to own the raw material out of which wealth is\r\nmade--if you compel me to stop at a purely arbitrary line, I must\r\ninform you that I am not going to undertake business on such terms.”\r\nWould not the capitalist say something like this; and from his point of\r\nview would he not be right?\r\n\r\nIf it were instantly possible to do so, we should take the capitalist\r\nat his word; appropriate the necessary instruments of production;\r\nand make them common property, the values they create accruing to\r\nthe community. But the human race generally contrives to exhaust\r\nevery device which stupidity can suggest before the right line of\r\naction is ultimately taken. I think therefore that some probably\r\ninefficient method of taxation and public control over combinations\r\nwill, as a matter of fact, be adopted. Such legislation will immensely\r\nrestrict individual liberty in certain directions, will produce much\r\nfriction, and may possibly hamper production; until by a long series\r\nof experiments men shall discover what is the most reasonable way of\r\nacquiring for the community as a whole the wealth which it produces.\r\nBut in any case individualism or anything whatever in the nature of\r\n_laisser faire_ goes by the board.\r\n\r\nAnd now, finally, what is the immediate policy for rational students\r\nof economics and genuine social reformers to adopt? Their motto must\r\nbe, _Nulla vestigia retrorsum_. To all quack proposals they must offer\r\na steady resistance. These proposals will take the form of attempts to\r\nbring back some economic condition out of which society has emerged.\r\nOne quack will desire to revive the old British yeomanry; another will\r\ntalk nonsense about “Fair Trade;” a third will offer to the rustic\r\n“three acres and a cow”; while a fourth will see salvation in getting\r\nrid of primogeniture and entail and “planting” prosperous laborers\r\non the soil--as though the laborers grew there like trees. Those who\r\nunderstand the economic crisis may be ready and eager to support any\r\nreform, however small, which is a genuine step forward: but they cannot\r\nsupport any effort to call back the past. They may help to build a\r\nnew bridge across the gulf that separates us from the Co-operative\r\nCommonwealth; but they can never repair the old broken-down structure\r\nwhich leads back to Individualism. Instead, therefore, of attempting\r\nto undo the work which capitalists are unconsciously doing for the\r\npeople, the real reformer will rather prepare the people, educated\r\nand organized as a true industrial democracy, to take up the threads\r\nwhen they fall from the weak hands of a useless possessing class. By\r\nthis means will the class struggle, with its greed, hate, and waste,\r\nbe ended, and the life hinted at by Whitman in his “Song of the\r\nExposition” be attained:\r\n\r\n  “Practical, peaceful life, the people’s life, the People themselves,\r\n  Lifted, illumined, bathed in peace--elate, secure in peace.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] Enc.

The previous\r\nessays have made it clear that we are dealing with Socialism in\r\nthat restricted sense in which it is defined by Schaeffle,[66] as\r\nhaving for its aim “the replacement of private capital by collective\r\ncapital: that is, by a method of production which, upon the basis of\r\nthe collective property of the sum of all the members of the society\r\nin the instruments of production, seeks to carry on a co-operative\r\norganization of national work.” We are not dealing with Socialism as a\r\nreligion, nor as concerned with questions of sex or family: we treat it\r\nthroughout as primarily a property-form, as the scheme of an industrial\r\nsystem for the supply of the material requisites of human social\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIf it were admitted that the establishment of such a system would\r\nguarantee just this much--that abject poverty should be done away, and\r\nthat every man and woman should be ensured the opportunity of obtaining\r\nsufficient food and covering in return for a moderate day’s work, we\r\nmight still be far from convincing some people that the realization of\r\nthat ideal will be a good thing for the world. There are still a great\r\nmany who, though they may not join in the common prophecy that the\r\nchief results of such a system would be an increase in beer-drinking\r\nand other stupid self-indulgence,[67] yet regard starvation and misery\r\nas part of the inevitable order of nature, and as necessary conditions\r\nof progress, conducive to the survival of what they are pleased to\r\ncall the “fittest” types of life. Such critics see danger to progress\r\nin any attempt to enrol intelligence and adaptiveness into conscious\r\ncombination against starvation and misery, to extinguish by concerted\r\neffort survivals of the accidents of primitive barbarism against\r\nwhich as individuals we are always struggling. This aim of Socialism,\r\naccordingly, does not wholly commend itself to their moral judgment,\r\nto their opinion of what is _good_ in the widest sense, although\r\nthey may willingly admit that the aim possesses a certain element of\r\nshortsighted good intention. Other persons, influenced by religious\r\nconceptions older than that of progress, and regarding morality less\r\nas determined by reference to that end than as a concern of the\r\nindividual, a certain state of the soul of each man, are inclined to\r\nview the material evils which Socialists desire to get rid of, as a\r\nnecessary schooling and discipline without which individual morality\r\nwould decay.\r\n\r\nAgainst these doctrines Socialists would maintain that the ordering\r\nof our national life, and of the relations between individuals and\r\nsocial groups throughout the world in accordance with the principles\r\nof Socialism, is the effectual and indispensable process for ensuring\r\nto the mass of mankind the advantages of progress already effected and\r\nits continued and orderly development, and for the realisation, in\r\nindividuals and the State, of the highest morality as yet imagined by\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIt may be well at this point to anticipate a challenge to define what\r\nis meant by the word “Morality,” and to briefly explain the position\r\nwhich will be assumed, and the method which will be followed throughout\r\nthe succeeding observations. It must be remembered that the subject\r\nof this essay is “The Moral Aspect of the Basis of Socialism,” and\r\nnot “The Socialist View of the Basis of Morals.” We may therefore\r\nconscientiously steer clear of the whirlpool of agelong controversy as\r\nto what that basis is, merely noting as we pass that any metaphysic\r\nof Ethics being necessarily universal, there is in this sense no\r\nspecial ethic or morality of Socialism. By such cautious procedure we\r\nsacrifice indeed the fascinating ambition to exhibit, by impressive\r\ndialectic pageant of deduction from first principles, the foundation\r\nof formal Socialism in the Idea that informs the universe. But we also\r\navoid the certainty of losing, at the very outset of our attempted\r\ndemonstration, the company of all but that minority who might assent\r\nto our fundamental propositions. A further sacrifice we shall make, in\r\ndescending to the unpretentious methods of empiricism; for we thereby\r\nrenounce the right of appeal to that theologic habit of mind common\r\nto Socialists with other pious persons. Mr. Henry George, educated\r\nunder the American Constitution, may share the familiarity of its\r\nframers with the intentions of the Creator and the natural rights of\r\nMan. He may prove, as did Mr. Herbert Spencer in his generous youth,\r\nthat private property in land is incompatible with the fundamental\r\nright of each individual to live and to own the product of his labor.\r\nBut positive ethical science knows nothing of natural and fundamental\r\nrights: it knows nothing of individual liberty, nothing of equality,\r\nnothing of underlying unity. Yet here again our loss has some redress;\r\nfor a brief survey will assure us that various schools of moral\r\nphilosophy, differing in their characteristic first principles, are\r\nconverging in the justification of Socialism; and that the practical\r\njudgments of contemporary mankind as to what sort of conduct is\r\n“moral,” and what conditions make for the increase of “common\r\nmorality,” are in practice largely coincident. They offer, at least,\r\na body of provisional opinion, or prejudice, to which we can appeal\r\nin presenting Socialism for criticism of its morality. The tribunal\r\nis by no means infallible: still, the common contemporary sense of\r\nhumanity may count for something. But in approaching the criticism of\r\nSocialism from the point of view of ethics, we are bound to go a little\r\ndeeper than this. While accepting the phenomena of current opinion on\r\nmorality as part of our material, we must follow the explorations of\r\nethical speculation into the causes and history of the development\r\nof those opinions. By examining the genesis of convictions that this\r\nor that kind of action is good or bad, moral or immoral, we shall be\r\nhelped to form a judgment as to which appears likely to persist and\r\nbe strengthened, and which to be modified, weakened, or forgotten. If\r\nthe claim of Socialism rests on judgments of the latter class, we may\r\nknow that it is a moribund bantling; if they preponderate among the\r\nobstacles to its credit, we may prophesy encouragingly of it; if it is\r\nsupported by those judgments whose persistence seems essential to the\r\nsurvival of the individual and of society, we may be assured of its\r\nrealisation in the future.\r\n\r\nSocialism appears as the offspring of Individualism, as the outcome\r\nof individualist struggle, and as the necessary condition for the\r\napproach to the individualist ideal. The opposition commonly assumed\r\nin contrasting the two is an accident of the now habitual confusion\r\nbetween personality and personalty, between a man’s life and the\r\nabundance of things that he has. Socialism is merely Individualism\r\nrationalized, organized, clothed, and in its right mind. Socialism is\r\ntaking form in advanced societies and the social revolution must be\r\nbrought to its formal accomplishment through the conscious action of\r\ninnumerable individuals seeking an avenue to rational and pleasant\r\nexistence for themselves and for those whose happiness and freedom\r\nthey desire as they do their own. All conscious action, all conscious\r\nmodification of conditions, is inspired by the desire of such personal\r\nrelief, satisfaction, or expression, by the attempt to escape from\r\nsome physical or intellectual distress. “Subjective volition, passion\r\nit is,” says Hegel, “that sets men in activity: men will not interest\r\nthemselves for anything unless they find their individuality gratified\r\nby its attainment.” This common end, this desire of personal relief\r\nor satisfaction, we see throughout recorded or indicated history\r\nimpelling every living creature on the earth; merging itself, as we\r\ntrace it backwards, in the mere apparent will to live of organisms\r\nnot recognized as conscious, and in the indestructible energy of the\r\ninorganic. The field of activity thus conceived presents a panorama of\r\nsomewhat large extent; but a very small division of it is all that we\r\nshall have to do with. For morality, whatever be its nature and basis,\r\ncertainly does not become recognizable to us, we cannot attribute the\r\nquality of rightness or wrongness, until the formation of society has\r\nbegun, until individuals are in conscious relation with individuals\r\nother than themselves.\r\n\r\nIf we could imagine an individual absolutely isolated, and having\r\nno relation at all with other sentient beings, _we_ could not say\r\nthat it was moral or immoral for him to eat, drink, sleep, breathe,\r\nwash himself, take exercise, cough, sneeze, and the like, just as\r\nmuch or as little, when or where he felt inclined. His conduct in\r\nthese activities must appear to us absolutely indifferent. We may\r\nhave some vague reflected suppositions as to what is necessary for\r\nthe dignity and development of the man’s “self,” as we might call\r\nit; but this is a matter about which the man may pretend to know\r\nas much as we do; and we have really no valid ground for prejudice\r\nagainst the habits of the recluse Indian fakir, who has, on the\r\nother hand, considerable claims to be regarded as a peculiarly holy\r\nindividual. But of every man living in society we can say, that if he\r\nstarves himself into inefficiency; if he gorges or fuddles himself;\r\nif he sleeps unseasonably; if he abstains from the fresh air, the\r\ncleanliness, and the exercise, necessary to keep his body healthy and\r\nhis presence pleasant; if he destroys his powers by over-work; then he\r\nis acting wrongly, immorally, unreasonably, in extreme cases insanely.\r\n(Insanity is only the name we give to abnormal deviation from what\r\nare accepted as reasonable and intelligible desires and behavior.)\r\nAnd if this is the case with actions of the kind loosely described as\r\nself-regarding, with those which most nearly concern the agent’s own\r\nperson, much more is it so with the kind of actions which necessarily\r\nand invariably affect other persons. Those relations of the individual\r\nwith his fellows in which subjective morality is chiefly recognized,\r\nhave no existence at all apart from society. Subjective morality,\r\nthen, being only distinguishable in the State, the extent of our\r\npanorama is already much diminished; for in every gentile or national\r\nsociety, and to some degree in the World-State of to-day, we find the\r\nindividualist activity, the desire and passion of the human unit, very\r\nlargely exercising itself in accordance with what we call a moral\r\nhabit. Innumerable types of society have been formed in the process of\r\nlife-development. In the oldest of these we recognize the elements of a\r\nconventional morality, similar to that by which our own human society\r\nis held together. We consider the ways of the ant; and we see that they\r\nare wise.\r\n\r\nWe find that in all societies those actions and habits are approved as\r\nmoral which tend to preserve the existence of society and the cohesion\r\nand convenience of its members; and that those which are or seem to be\r\nfraught with contrary tendencies are considered immoral. It is plain\r\nthat no society in which these judgments were habitually reversed\r\ncould continue in existence; and this fact will account for much of\r\nthat general inherited disposition to actions socially beneficial,\r\nand inherited repugnance to those presumably the reverse, which form\r\nso large a part of what we speak of as conscience. So deep in grain\r\nhave many of these common judgments come to be that their influence\r\nhas passed out of consciousness; and they are obeyed automatically or\r\ninstinctively without any reflexion as to their moral aspect arising in\r\nthe agent’s mind. It is, for example, so necessary for the existence\r\nof society that the citizen should abstain from slaughtering at large,\r\nsuch self-restraint is so evidently reasonable, its non-observance\r\nso contrary to common sense, that when we find a murder done for\r\nmere desire of bloodshed and under the impulse of no other passion\r\nwhatsoever, we do not think of the murderer as immoral, but rather\r\nas insane, judging the man who would destroy the life of society as\r\ncoroners’ juries by their habitual verdict upon suicides pronounce of\r\nthe man who destroys his own.\r\n\r\nMost of the habits of activity and avoidance, necessary for the mere\r\nphysical existence of the individual as moral actions and abstentions\r\nare necessary for the existence of society, have long ago become\r\nautomatic, and are sunk, so far as common opinion is concerned,\r\npermanently out of the purview of moral criticism. All the involuntary\r\nfunctions of the human body which conduce to its nutrition and\r\nmaintenance in health have been gradually acquired in the course of\r\nages, as the conditions necessary for the expression of the mere animal\r\nwill to live the largest and freest life permitted by the physical\r\nenvironment. And as the bodily form and functions of the typical\r\nindividual of each species have accrued and become established as the\r\nindispensable mechanic of the mere determination to exist, so the form\r\nand institution of society, and the relations and mutual behavior of\r\nits individuals, have been adjusted and established as the equally\r\nindispensable conditions for the expression of the determination to\r\nexist more fully, for the enlargement of freedom and opportunity for\r\nthe gratification of those passions and aspirations, the display of\r\nthose energies and activities which characterize the more complex forms\r\nof life as it passes from the inorganic and vegetative to the conscious\r\nand self-conscious stages of its evolution.\r\n\r\nThe primitive forms of human society we must infer to have grown up\r\nand survived simply because they increased the efficiency of man\r\nas a feeding and a fighting animal, just as did those of the wolf,\r\nthe beaver, and the ant. Society has now grown to be for man the\r\nindispensable guarantee not only of nutrition and protection, but of\r\nthe opportunity to imagine and attain a thousand varieties of more\r\nrefined satisfaction. So far as man has attained freedom to do and\r\nbe as he desires, he has attained it only through the evolution of\r\nsociety. When a society perishes, as societies organically weak among\r\nstronger competitors have done and will do, the individual perishes\r\nwith it, or is forced backwards with impaired freedom until a fresh\r\nsocial integration renews and extends his powers of self-development.\r\nSocieties, as has been pointed out by Sidney Webb on page 51, must\r\nsafeguard their existence to-day for the very same reasons for which\r\nsociety has formed itself. It has grown up for the convenience of\r\nindividuals, for their defence and relief under the pressure of\r\nall that was not themselves--of Nature, as we call it--beasts, and\r\ncompeting men, to give a little breathing space, a little elbow\r\nroom, amid the storm and stress of primæval existence; and from\r\nthat beginning it has been unfolded and elaborated, each step of\r\nprogress effected for the convenience of active individuals, until the\r\nindividual of to-day is born as a leaf upon a mighty tree, or a coral\r\ninsect in a sponge, himself to live his individual life, and in living\r\nit to modify the social organism in which he has his being.\r\n\r\nReviewing the development in society of the conditions for the\r\nsatisfaction of the individual will to live, and to live in the best\r\nway conceivable, we see in the progress of moral ideas the progress of\r\ndiscovery of the most reasonable manner of ordering the life of the\r\nindividual and the form of social institutions under the contemporary\r\nenvironment. It has already been pointed out that some kinds of\r\nanti-social action are so unreasonable, so obviously prejudicial\r\nto the attainment of the common end of conscious individuals, that\r\nwe brand them unhesitatingly as insane. Instances suggested were\r\nextreme personal uncleanliness or dissipation, and extreme cruelty\r\nor blood-thirstiness. The reason why other anti-social or indirectly\r\nsuicidal kinds of action are not yet classed as madness, though there\r\nis a steady tendency towards so treating them, is plainly that some\r\nactivities of the individual, though hurtful to other citizens just\r\nas the activity of a pack of wolves or a predatory tribe is hurtful\r\nto adjacent societies, are commonly aimed at gratifying impulses and\r\npassions which are not yet grown so rare as blood-thirst, are not yet\r\nrecognized as irrational or valueless, or even are acknowledged to be\r\nin their proper scope harmless, desirable, or necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is an established social convention (in England) that it is immoral\r\nto steal or to defraud. Only in very extreme cases do we account these\r\npursuits as evidences of mania; for though injustice and dishonesty are\r\nincompatible with the health of society, and thus actually unreasonable\r\nand indirectly suicidal, the desires which prompt men to them are only\r\nat worst exaggerations of the desire for wealth or subsistence, which\r\neveryone recognizes as a necessary condition of the mere continuance\r\nof life. Nay, where the alternative is death for lack of subsistence,\r\nmany consider that neither are immoral. At the other extreme, when the\r\ninstinct prompts aggression in defiance of the conscious reason and\r\nwithout assignable purpose of gain, when Jean Valjean robs the little\r\nSavoyard, or a noble earl pockets the sugar-tongs, we speak of mental\r\naberration or of kleptomania.\r\n\r\nThe case of self-defence is similar. Quarrelsomeness and violence\r\nare destructive of social existence, or at best impede its higher\r\nelaboration. But readiness of resentment and quickness of fist were\r\nfor ages and ages necessities for individual survival; and for ages\r\nand ages more their kindred social qualities or spirit and valor were\r\nnecessary for social survival, and accordingly ranked as virtues. The\r\ninstruction to turn the other cheek to the smiter is even now, perhaps,\r\nan exaggeration of the precept commendable to Socialists when charged\r\nby the London police: to suffer one’s self to be killed without reason\r\nis clearly and unmistakably immoral. As the western world advances\r\nout of warfare into industry, more and more of what was once military\r\nvirtue becomes immorality in the individual; until an habitual ferocity\r\nwhich might once have qualified its subject for chieftainship may\r\nnowadays consign him to penal servitude or Bedlam.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing illustrations have been treated, for the present purpose,\r\nwith reference only to the effect of the behavior of the individual\r\nupon society. It is indeed certain that anti-social action does not,\r\nas a rule, effect permanent satisfaction for the individual (isolated\r\ninstances, of the type of Shelley’s Count Cenci, notwithstanding); but,\r\nindependently of this, the actions and propensities of the individual\r\nhave always, it appears, been judged by his fellows moral or immoral\r\nchiefly according to their supposed effects upon society. The object of\r\nevery living creature being to do as he pleases, if what he pleases to\r\ndo incommodes other people they will take measures to restrain him from\r\ndoing it. This they strive to effect by means of laws and conventional\r\ncodes of morality, the main difference between the two being that the\r\ncode of law is enforced by the infliction of direct personal punishment\r\nby the officers of the State. This acceptance of codes of laws and\r\nconventions of morality leads to a secondary series of judgments as\r\nto right and wrong; for it comes to be accounted immoral to break the\r\nlaw whether the law itself be good or not, and reprehensible to depart\r\nfrom convention whether convention be any longer reasonable or not.\r\nThis secondary morality is as it were the bud-sheath of the individual,\r\nwhich support he cannot dispense with until he has come to his full\r\npowers, but which he must dispense with if he is to fully realise his\r\nown freedom. Customary morality prevents him during the process of his\r\neducation from pursuing his own satisfaction across the corns of his\r\nfellow creatures. In the process of education he learns that for the\r\nunit in society the word _self_ includes more than the individual:\r\nthe infant very soon finds out that what disagrees with his mother\r\ndisagrees with him; the child, that the failure of his father’s income\r\nmeans misery and hunger to the family. To say nothing of the facts\r\nof sympathy, every man born into an advanced society is early made\r\naware that the satisfaction of his mere material needs depends upon\r\nthe activities of that society around him quite as much as upon his\r\nown. All through the growth of nations and societies the complexity\r\nof this interdependence of individuals has increased, the areas of\r\nsocial consciousness have been extended and unified, from the solitary\r\ncave-dweller to the family or horde, from the tribe to the nation, and\r\nfrom the nation, by commerce, to the world, till the fortunes of each\r\npeople have power over the hopes and fears of workers in every other,\r\nand the arts, the learning, and the literature of a hundred painful\r\ncivilizations are available for us to-day, all the kingdoms of the\r\nearth and their glory displayed in a moment of time.\r\n\r\nBut not by bread alone does mankind live. Very early in the course of\r\nhuman evolution must the type of individual to whom all society was\r\nrepugnant have been eliminated and suppressed by natural selection.\r\nThe social instinct, the disposition to find comfort in comradeship\r\nindependently of its material advantages, is of such evident\r\nantiquity in Man that we are justified in speaking of it as one of\r\nhis fundamental and elementary characteristics. It is easy enough to\r\nsuggest theories of the origin of this adhesiveness, this affection,\r\nthis sympathy, in the conditions of racial survival: the important fact\r\nfor us is its remarkable susceptibility of cultivation and extension.\r\nThe individual in society does that which is pleasant to his friends,\r\nand abstains from doing that which is unpleasant, not because he likes\r\nto be thought a good fellow, or expects benefits in return, but simply\r\nbecause it gives him immediate pleasure so to act. He is sensitive to\r\nthat which hurts them, not because he fears that his own defences are\r\nweakened by their injury, but because they have actually become part of\r\nhimself by the extension of his consciousness over them. This social\r\ninstinct, this disposition to benevolent sympathy, appears almost\r\nas inextinguishable as the personal desire of life: in innumerable\r\ninstances it has proved far stronger.\r\n\r\nThe recognition by each individual of his dependence on society or\r\nsensitiveness to his own interest, and his affection towards society\r\nor sensitiveness to its interest: these two faces of the same fact\r\nrepresent an intricate tissue of social consciousness extremely\r\nsensitive to all kinds of anti-social, or immoral, action. The moral\r\neducation of the individual appears formally as the process of\r\nlearning, by sheer extension of knowledge and experience, and nothing\r\nelse, how he may harmonise and follow out his own desires in these two\r\naspects and their combinations. He has to learn how to provide for the\r\nneeds of his bodily life in a manner that will not interfere with the\r\nfreedom of others to do the same. Laws and conventions of morality\r\nguide him at first in this respect; but the man cannot be said to be\r\nfree until he acts morally because, foreseeing that on the satisfaction\r\nof these primary needs new desires will emerge whose satisfaction\r\nwill give him a more exquisite contentment, he perceives that it is\r\nreasonable so to act. The existence and stability of society are the\r\nindispensable guarantee for the general satisfaction of the primary\r\ndesires of individuals, therefore it is unreasonable to weaken society\r\nby immoral action; but much more are the existence and health of\r\nsociety indispensable conditions for the common birth and satisfaction\r\nof the secondary desires, the desires which have created all that is\r\nmost valuable in civilisation and which find their satisfaction in\r\nart, in culture, in human intercourse, in love. The moral education\r\nof the individual is the lesson, not that desire is evil, and that he\r\ncan only attain his freedom by ceasing to desire, for this is death,\r\nor desertion, and the army of the living presses on to fuller life;\r\nbut that the wider, fuller satisfaction is built upon the simpler, and\r\ncommon morality a condition of its possibility; that there are certain\r\nmanners and methods in which, if he goes about to save his life, he\r\nmost infallibly will lose it; and that love, the social instinct, and\r\nscience, which is ordered knowledge, are his only reliable tutors in\r\npractical morality.\r\n\r\nBut man in society not only lives his individual life: he also\r\nmodifies the form of social institutions in the direction indicated by\r\nreason--in such a manner, that is, as it seems to his understanding\r\nwill render them more efficient for securing freedom for that life\r\nof his. And just as certain forms of individual activity, in their\r\npassage into and through the field of positive criticism, appear first\r\nas indifferent, because they seem to concern the individual only, then\r\nas moral or immoral, because recognized as affecting society, later\r\nas simply rational or insane, morality having here formally attained\r\nits identification with reason and immorality with folly, and at\r\nlast become habitual, instinctive, and unconscious; so institutions,\r\noriginating in modes apparently accidental, come to be recognized\r\nas useful and valuable additions to the machinery of existence, are\r\nbuttressed with all the authority and sanction of religion, and finally\r\npass into unquestioned acceptance by the common-sense of men. In time\r\nsome fundamental change in the conditions of the life of individuals\r\nis introduced by causes similarly unforeseen: the form of the old\r\ninstitution ceases to subserve the common end: it begins to cramp the\r\nfreedom of the majority, who no longer require its support. Meanwhile\r\nit has established a minority, ostensibly controlling it for the\r\ncommon weal, in a position to administer it in the sole interest of\r\ntheir class. These, as their existence appears dependent on their\r\nso administering it, cannot be untaught the habit except by such\r\nmodification of the institution as will render it again impossible for\r\nany class to have a special interest in its contemporary form.\r\n\r\nThis process is so familiar in history that it would be a waste of\r\ntime here to illustrate it by tracing it in the growth of monarchies,\r\naristocracies, priesthoods, chattel slavery, feudal bondage,\r\nrepresentative government, or others of its innumerable manifestations.\r\nThe institution of private property in certain things is in many\r\nrespects so reasonable and convenient for the majority of mankind,\r\nand was so conspicuously advantageous for those stronger individuals\r\nunder whose leadership the beginnings of tribal civilisations were\r\ndeveloped, that very early in their history it received the sanction\r\nof moral convention, religion, and law. It was obviously necessary\r\nfor the establishment of industrial society, that each man should own\r\nthe product of his labor and the tools necessary for him to labor\r\neffectually. But the Industrial Revolution described in the third paper\r\nof this series has entirely changed the conditions under which men\r\nproduce wealth, and the character of the tools with which they work,\r\nwhile the sanctions of law and conventional morality still cling to\r\nall that has been imported under the old definition of property. If\r\nthe idea so constantly appealed to in justification of property law\r\nis to be realised; if the fruits of each man’s labor[68] are to be\r\nguaranteed to him and he is to own the instruments with which he works;\r\nif the laws of property are not to establish a parasitic class taking\r\ntribute from the labor of others in the forms of Rent and Interest,\r\nthen we must modify our administration of property. We must admit that\r\nas the agricultural laborer cannot individually own the farm he works\r\non and its stock, as the factory hand cannot individually own the mill,\r\nland and industrial capital are things in which private property is\r\nimpossible, except on condition of a small minority owning all such\r\nproperty and the great majority none at all.\r\n\r\nSocialists contend that this system of private property in land and\r\ncapital is actively destructive of the conditions in which alone the\r\ncommon morality necessary for happy social life is possible. Without\r\nany demand upon the faith of those persons who deny the capacity of\r\naverage human nature for the temperance and kindliness indispensable\r\nfor the success of a true co-operative commonwealth, they assert that\r\nthis modern development of the property system (a development of the\r\nlast few generations only, and unprecedented in the history of the\r\nworld), is more and more forcing the individual into anti-social\r\ndisposition and action, and thereby destroying the promise of free and\r\nfull existence, which only the health and progressive development of\r\nthe social organism can give him. It has become plainly reasonable that\r\nwhen this is the effect of our property system, we should modify our\r\ninstitutions in the directions which will give us freedom, just as we\r\nmodified the institutions which subjected us to a feudal aristocracy,\r\nand abolished for ever the laws which enabled one man to hold another\r\nas his chattel slave.\r\n\r\nThere is on record a Greek proverb, that so soon as a man has ensured\r\na livelihood, then he should begin to practise virtue. We all protest\r\nthat he will do well to practise virtue under any circumstances;\r\nbut we admit on reflection that our judgment as to what is virtuous\r\naction, depends upon the circumstances under which action is to be\r\ntaken. Whether we approve the killing of one man by another, depends\r\nentirely on the circumstances of the case; and there is scarcely one\r\nof the acts which our laws regard as criminal, which could not, under\r\nimaginable circumstances, be justified. Our laws, and our conventional\r\nopinions, as to what conduct is moral or immoral, are adapted to the\r\nordinary circumstances of the average man in society, society being in\r\nthem presumed to be homogeneous, not to contain in itself essential\r\ndistinctions between classes, or great contrasts between the conditions\r\nof individuals.\r\n\r\nBut that element in our private property system which is at present\r\nthe main object of the Socialist attack, the individual ownership of\r\nthe instruments of production, land and capital, in an age when the\r\nuse of those instruments has become co-operative, results, and must\r\ninevitably result, as the foregoing dissertations have sought to prove,\r\nin the division of society into two classes, whose very livelihood is\r\nensured to them by methods essentially different. The livelihood of\r\nthe typical proletarian is earned by the exercise of his faculties for\r\nuseful activity: the livelihood of the typical capitalist, or owner of\r\nproperty, is obtained, without any contribution of his or her activity,\r\nin the form of a pension called rent, interest, or dividend, guaranteed\r\nby law out of the wealth produced from day to day by the activities of\r\nthe proletariat.\r\n\r\nObserve the effect of this distinction in moral phenomena. Most of our\r\ncommon opinions as to social morality, are adapted to a society in\r\nwhich every citizen is contributing active service. The most ancient\r\nand universal judgments of mankind as to the virtues of industry, of\r\nhonesty, of loyalty and forbearance between man and man, of temperance,\r\nfortitude and just dealing, point to the elementary conditions\r\nnecessary for the survival and strengthening of societies of equal and\r\nfree individuals dependent for their subsistence upon the exercise\r\nof each one’s abilities, and upon his fitness for co-operation with\r\nhis fellows. But where a class or society exists, not dependent upon\r\nits own industry, but feeding like a parasite upon another society\r\nor class; when the individuals of such a parasitic society in no way\r\ndepend for their livelihood or their freedom upon their fitness for\r\nco-operation one with another upon themselves, or upon any personal\r\nrelation with the class that feeds them; then the observation of the\r\nmoral conventions of industrial and co-operative societies is in many\r\nrespects quite unnecessary for the continuance of the life of the\r\nparasitic society, or for the pleasant existence of the individuals\r\ncomposing it. All that is necessary is that the established laws and\r\nconventions should continue to be observed by the industrial class\r\n(“it is required _in stewards_ that a man be found faithful”); and\r\nas the existence of the propertied class in modern societies, does\r\ndepend ultimately upon the observance by the bulk of the people of\r\nthis conventional morality, the propertied class professes publicly\r\nto venerate and observe conventions, which, in its private practice,\r\nit has long admitted to be obsolete. This complication is a perennial\r\nsource of cant. To this we owe the spectacle of Sir William Harcourt\r\nadvocating total abstinence, of Mr. Arthur Balfour commending\r\nChristianity; to this the continual inculcation of industry and thrift\r\nby idle and extravagant people, with many another edifying variation on\r\nthe theme of Satan’s reproval of sin. Temperance, Christian morality,\r\nindustry, and economy are of considerable social utility; but for\r\nthe members of a propertied class they are not necessitated by the\r\nconditions of its existence, and consequently in such classes are\r\nneither observed nor commonly made the subject of moral criticism.\r\n\r\nConsider the case of industry alone--of the moral habit of earning\r\none’s subsistence by useful activity. Assuming sustenance to be\r\nguaranteed, there is no obvious and pressing social necessity for\r\nsuch exertion. No doubt the paradise of the maid-of-all-work--where\r\nshe means to do _nothing_ for ever and ever--is the paradise of an\r\nundeveloped intelligence. A society relieved of the function of\r\nproviding its own material sustenance need not relapse into general\r\ntorpor, though the result is very commonly that an individual so\r\ncircumstanced relapses into uselessness. It will be vain to preach to\r\nsuch an individual that he will find his fullest satisfaction in honest\r\ntoil: he will simply laugh in your face, and go out partridge shooting,\r\nhunting, or yachting, or to Monte Carlo or the Rocky Mountains, finding\r\nin such an exercise of his capacities the keenest imaginable enjoyment\r\nfor months in succession. He may feel no inclination at all to work\r\nfor the benefit of the people whose work is supporting him: all that\r\nhe, like the rest of us, requires is to find some means of passing his\r\ntime in an agreeable or exciting manner. Accordingly, in that section\r\nof our nation which speaks of itself as “society,” being indeed a\r\nsociety separated by economic parasitism from the common mass, we find\r\nthat the characteristic activity is the provision of agreeable and\r\nexciting methods of passing time. This being the end of fashionable\r\nsociety, its code of morality is naturally quite different from the\r\ncode suitable for industrial societies. Truthfulness is preached in\r\nthese as a cardinal virtue. Lying is of course common enough in all\r\nclasses, and is generally immoral; but in the fashionable world it\r\nis not only a perfectly legitimate means of avoiding an undesired\r\nvisitor, or almost any other unpleasant experience: it is a positive\r\nnecessity of conventional politeness and good manners. It is really\r\nharmless here, almost a virtue. To return to the virtue of industry:\r\nthough the conventional morality of the people, necessary for the life\r\nof the nation, permeates with its vibrations this parasitic society\r\nwhich it enfolds; and though the unfailing contentment which a really\r\nintelligent man finds in social activity keeps a good many of the\r\npropertied class usefully occupied, the actual public opinion of that\r\nclass is absolutely in accordance with the conditions of their life.\r\nThe clerk in a Government office is congratulated by middle-class\r\nacquaintances on his luck in obtaining a berth where he need do no\r\nmore work than he chooses; and it is habitually assumed that he will\r\nchoose, like the Trafalgar Square fountains, to play from ten to four,\r\nwith an interval for lunch. That may or may not be an adequate account\r\nof his activities: the significant thing is that such an assumption\r\nshould not be considered insulting. But how indignantly will the very\r\nsame acquaintances denounce the idleness and untrustworthiness of a\r\nBritish working man suspected, in the service of a private master, of\r\ninterpreting his time work as most servants of the public are good\r\nhumoredly assumed, without hint of disapproval, to interpret theirs!\r\n\r\nThis obsolescence of elementary social morality is most noticeable in\r\nwomen dependent upon incomes from property. They are doubly removed\r\nfrom the primary conditions of life; they are less likely than their\r\nmen folk to be engaged in any work of perceptible social utility\r\noutside of their own homes; and their intellectual education being\r\ngenerally far more imperfect, it is only natural that their ideas of\r\nmorality should be still more intimately adapted to the conditions\r\nof their class, and less to the general conditions of human society.\r\nThe angels of heaven, we have always understood, are exempt from the\r\napparatus of digestion, and are clothed as freely as the lilies of the\r\nfield. In any society where all common needs are so supplied it would\r\nbe immoral, surely, because a waste of time, to work as for a living.\r\nNow the universal ideal of capitalism is that man, being created a\r\nlittle lower than the angels, should raise himself to their level in\r\nthis respect by the acquisition of property, a process pleasantly\r\ndescribed as attaining a competence or independence, that is to say\r\nthe right to be dependent and incompetent. The result of this has\r\nbeen a prejudice, which only within quite recent years has begun to\r\nbe seriously shaken, that it is humiliating, even disgraceful, for a\r\nlady to have to earn her own living at all, for a gentleman to practise\r\na handicraft for money, for a nobleman to go into trade: a prejudice\r\nfor which, in a class society, there was much justification, but\r\nwhich is obviously a fragment of class morality directly antagonistic\r\nto the common social morality which recognises all useful industry\r\nas praiseworthy. It is now yielding to economic pressure and to the\r\nstimulus of the desire to get rich. Ladies are being driven, and in\r\nspite of Mr. Walter Besant’s protestations will continue to be driven,\r\ninto most of the female handicrafts, though some are still outside the\r\npale of respectability. Ranching in America, though not yet drovering\r\nand butchering in England, is suitable occupation for the aristocracy.\r\nThe “directing” of companies and the patronizing of nitrogenous\r\nVolunteer Colonels are legitimate modes of exploiting of a title. The\r\nprejudice against useful employments is balanced for decency’s sake by\r\na hypocritical laudation of useless ones. The fiction so dear to the\r\nPrimrose Dame, that the rich are the employers of the poor, the idlers\r\nthe supporters of the industrious, takes nowadays forms more insidious\r\nthan the rugged proposition that private vices are public benefits. The\r\namusements, the purely recreational activities, of country gentlemen\r\nare glorified in the _National Review_[69] as “hard work.” It is\r\npretended that the leisured class is the indispensable patron and\r\npromoter of culture and the fine arts. The claim that such functions\r\nare virtues is a direct concession to the feeling that some effort must\r\nbe made to exhibit the practices of parasitic society as compatible\r\nwith its preaching of the common social morality.\r\n\r\nThe same necessity causes an exaggerated tribute of praise to be\r\npaid to such really useful work as is done under no compulsion but\r\nthat of the social instinct. This kind of activity is habitually\r\npointed to, by the friends of those who are engaged in it, as\r\nevidence of extraordinary virtue. A few hours of attention every week\r\nto the condition of the poor, a few gratuitously devoted to local\r\nadministration, a habit of industry in any branch of literature or\r\nscience: these are imputed as an excess of righteousness by persons\r\nwho denounce the wage laborer as an idler and a shirk. Such activity\r\nis work of supererogation, approved but not required or expected. The\r\nmotto of “noblesse oblige” has not been adopted by the plutocracy.\r\nSimilar approbation and admiration are extended to those who, while\r\nalready earning their living by a reasonable day’s work, employ their\r\nspare time, or a part of it, in gratuitous activities of the kinds\r\nreferred to. It may be safely said that by far the greater portion of\r\nthis kind of work is done by people who are simultaneously earning an\r\nincome in middle class professions or by the less exhausting forms of\r\nwage labor. Most of them have probably had experience of the ridiculous\r\ninappropriateness of the commendation usually paid to their gratuitous\r\nenergy by well-to-do friends. The activity is moral, no doubt; but\r\nits exercise gives no sensation of virtue or praiseworthiness; it is\r\nfollowed because it is seen to be reasonable, because it is the path\r\nindicated by common-sense towards the satisfaction of the individual\r\npassion for the extension of freedom and love.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of class morality are ancient and familiar enough.\r\nThey have varied throughout history with the changing character of\r\nthe basis of class distinctions. The great permanent distinction of\r\nsex, and the social relations between man and woman which have arisen\r\nthereout in the period of civilisation from which the world is now\r\nemerging, have resulted not only in the establishment of distinct codes\r\nof chastity for the sexes, but also in innumerable prejudices against\r\nthe participation of one sex or the other in activities having nothing\r\nwhatever to do with physiological distinction. They have even succeeded\r\nin producing, through inequality of freedom and education, well marked\r\ndifferences in mental habit, which show themselves continually when\r\nmen and women are confronted with the same questions of truthfulness,\r\nhonor, or logic. It is hardly necessary to observe that most of these\r\ndifferences are distinctly traceable to the institution of private\r\nproperty, and to its concentration in the hands of the male as the\r\nstronger individual in a competitive society. The class moralities\r\nof societies whose orders have been based immediately on status or\r\ncaste have formed the subject of an extensive literature. The tracing\r\nof all such distinctions to their root in economic circumstances is\r\nscarcely less interesting than the investigation of the same foundation\r\nfor sex morality. But even the interpreters of the Church Catechism\r\nhave abandoned the appeal to status as the basis of duty; the idea\r\nof hereditary aristocracy is dead; and class distinctions and their\r\nappurtenant ethics are now founded directly and obviously on property.\r\n\r\nWe have glanced at some effects of our present property system which\r\nwork continually for the destruction of the traditions of social\r\nmorality in the capitalist class. The fundamental idea of that system,\r\nthat man can live without working, as the angels of heaven, is\r\n(fortunately) self-contradictory in this respect, that in human society\r\nno class can so live except by the double labor of another class or\r\nclasses. The would-be angelic society on earth must either own chattel\r\nslaves, or be a military caste taking tribute, or a parasitical and\r\nexploiting class extracting rent and interest by the operation of\r\nthe industrial system analysed in the preceding papers. Such a class\r\nand such a system are, as we are all becoming aware, more virulently\r\nrevolutionary in their operation, and more certain to bring about their\r\nown destruction than either chattel slavery or feudalism. Of these\r\nthree phases of human injustice that of wage slavery will surely be\r\nthe shortest. But meanwhile the propertied class assumes to represent\r\ncivilisation; its approved morality is preached and taught in church\r\nand schools; it debases our public opinion; and it directly poisons all\r\nthat host of workers who are at present hangers-on of the rich, whether\r\nas menial servants or as ministering to their especial amusements and\r\nextravagance. There is no such snob as a fashionable dressmaker; and\r\nthere is no class of the proletariat so dehumanised as the class of\r\ndomestic servants.\r\n\r\nNow if these results are effected in the class whose livelihood is\r\nassured, and whose education and culture have given it a hold on the\r\nhigher inducements to morality--if we here find morality strangled at\r\nthe root and starving, what shall we find when we turn to the masses\r\nwhose livelihood is not assured them? Our Greek, perhaps, would say\r\nthat it was impossible for them to practise virtue, just as Plato in\r\nhis “Republic” suggested that only the philosophic class could be\r\nreally moral, since slaves and the proletariat could not receive the\r\nintellectual education necessary to train the reason. The great bulk\r\nof the wage earning class in modern civilised countries is so far\r\nassured of its livelihood that it remains thoroughly permeated with\r\ncommon social morality. It is, from habit and preference, generally\r\nindustrious and kindly, thus exhibiting the two most important\r\nqualifications for social life. It remains to a great extent honest,\r\nthough competition and capitalism are directly antagonistic to\r\nhonesty. The decalogue of commercial morality has its own peculiar\r\ninterpretation of stealing, murder, false witness and coveting; and\r\nyet the most unscrupulous wrecker in the City will be outraged in his\r\nfinest feelings by the class morality of the plumber, who, called in\r\nto bring the gas to reason, takes the opportunity to disorganise the\r\nwater-supply and introduce a duster into the drain. The employer is\r\naghast at the increase of idleness and bad workmanship under a system\r\nin which the good workman knows that to work his best will not only not\r\nbe worth his while but will lead to the exaction of heavier tasks from\r\nhis fellows.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in the mass of the proletariat that the action of our\r\nproperty system in destroying elementary morality is most conspicuous.\r\nIt is in those whom it excludes even from the proletariat proper that\r\nthis extreme result is clearest. The characteristic operation of the\r\nmodern industrial economy is continually and repeatedly to thrust\r\nout individuals or bodies of the workers from their settlement in\r\nthe social organism--to eject, as it were, the coral insect from the\r\ncell in which he is developing. The capitalist farming system expels\r\nthe agricultural laborer from the village; the machine expels the\r\ncraftsman from the ranks of skilled labor; the perpetual competition\r\nand consolidation of capital in every trade alternately destroys\r\nemployment in that trade and disorganises others. Overproduction in one\r\nyear leaves thousands of workers wageless in the next. The ranks of\r\nunskilled labor, the army of the unemployed, are day by day recruited\r\nin these fashions. An inveterate social habit, an almost indestructible\r\npatience, a tenacious identification of his own desire with the\r\ndesire of those whom he loves, in most cases preserve the worker from\r\naccepting the sentence of exclusion from society. If he is able-bodied,\r\nintelligent and fortunate, he will struggle with hard times till he\r\nfinds fresh occupation among strange surroundings; but woe to him if\r\nhe be weakly, or old, or unpractical. In such a case he will almost\r\ninfallibly become a pauper or an outcast, one of that residuum of\r\nunskilled, unemployed, unprofitable and hopeless human beings which\r\nin all great cities festers about the base of the social pyramid. And\r\nhis children will become the street Arabs and the corner-boys and the\r\nchild-whores and the sneak-thieves who, when they come of age, accept\r\ntheir position as outside of social life and resume the existence of\r\nthe wild beasts that fathered man--the purely predatory and unsocial\r\nactivity of harrying their neighbors for their own support. Before\r\nsociety was, morality was not: those who have no part nor lot in the\r\nends for which society exists will adapt their morality to suit their\r\noutcast state: there will indeed be honor among thieves, just as there\r\nwill be cant and insincerity among the parasitic rich; but the youth\r\nwho has been nurtured between the reformatory and the slum has little\r\nchance of finding a foothold, if he would, in the restless whirl of\r\nmodern industry, and still less of retaining permanently such foothold\r\nas he may manage to find.\r\n\r\nWhen the conditions of social life are such that the individual may\r\nbe excluded through no unfitness of his own for co-operation, or may\r\nbe born without a chance of acquiring fitness for it, we are brought\r\nface to face with the conditions of primitive ages. And if you force\r\nhim back upon the elemental instincts, one of two things will happen.\r\nEither, if the individual is weak through physical deterioration or\r\nincapacity to combine with his fellow outcasts, he will be crushed\r\nand killed by society and putrefy about its holy places; or, if he\r\nhas indomitable life and vigor, he will revert to the argument of\r\nelemental forces: he will turn and explode society. Here, then, we\r\nshould fear explosion, for we are not as submissive in extremities as\r\nthe proletariats of arrested Indian civilisations. But with us the\r\nclass whose freedom is incessantly threatened by the operation of\r\nprivate capitalism is the class which by its political position holds\r\nin its hands the key to the control of industrial form: that is to say,\r\nits members can modify, as soon as they elect to, the laws of property\r\nand inheritance in this State of Britain. They can, as soon as they\r\nsee clearly what is needed supersede institutions now immoral because\r\nuseless and mischievous by institutions which shall re-establish the\r\nelementary conditions of social existence and the possibility of the\r\ncorresponding morality--namely, the opportunity for each individual to\r\nearn his living and the compulsion upon him to do so.\r\n\r\nReturning from the consideration of the “residuum” and the “criminal\r\nclasses,” we find that even the workers of the employed proletariat are\r\nby no means wholly moral. In spite of the massive healthiness of their\r\nbehavior in ordinary relations, they are generally coarse in their\r\nhabits; they lack intelligence in their amusements and refinement in\r\ntheir tastes. The worst result of this is the popularity of boozing\r\nand gambling and allied forms of excitement, with their outcomes in\r\nviolence and meanness. But when once society has ensured for man the\r\nopportunity for satisfying his primary needs--once it has ensured him\r\na healthy body and a wholesome life, his advance in the refinements of\r\nsocial morality, in the conception and satisfaction of his secondary\r\nand more distinctly human desires, is solely and entirely a matter of\r\neducation. This will be attested by every man and woman who has at all\r\npassed through the primary to the secondary passions. But education in\r\nthe sense alluded to is impossible for the lad who leaves school at\r\nfourteen and works himself weary six days in the week ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Socialistic institution of considerable importance and\r\nextent is the now decrepit Catholic Church. The Catholic Church has\r\nalways insisted on the duty of helping the poor, not on the ground\r\nof the social danger of a “residuum,” but by the nobler appeal to\r\nthe instinct of human benevolence. The Catholic Church developed,\r\nrelatively to the enlightenment of its age, the widest and freest\r\nsystem of education the world has ever seen before this century.\r\nCatholic Christianity, by its revolutionary conception that God\r\nwas incarnated in Man, exploding the hideous superstition that the\r\nimagination of the thoughts of man’s heart was only to do evil\r\ncontinually, and substituting the faith in the perfectibility of each\r\nindividual soul; by its brilliant and powerful generalisations that God\r\nmust be Love, because there is nothing better, and that man is freed\r\nfrom the law by the inward guidance of grace, has done more for social\r\nmorality than any other religion of the world.\r\n\r\nProtestant Individualism in England shattered the Catholic Church;\r\nfounded the modern land system upon its confiscated estates; destroyed\r\nthe mediæval machinery of charity and education; and in religion\r\nrehabilitated the devil, and the doctrines of original sin and the\r\ndamnable danger of reason and good works.\r\n\r\nOut of the wreckage of the Catholic Church, and amid the dissolution\r\nof the Protestant religion, there successively emerged, at an interval\r\nof some three hundred years, the two great socialistic institutions of\r\nthe Poor Law and the People’s Schools. As the pretence of a foundation\r\nof Christian obligation withered from out of the Poor Law, till it has\r\ncome to be outspokenly recognised as nothing but a social safety-valve,\r\nthe individualist and commercial administration of this rudimentary\r\nsocialistic machinery deprived it of its efficiency even in this\r\nelementary function. He to whom the workhouse means the break up of his\r\nhome, and his own condemnation to a drudgery insulting because useless\r\nand wasteful, would as lief take his exclusion from society in another\r\nand a less degrading way, either by death, or by reluctant enrolment in\r\nthe “residuum”; and so it has come to pass that outside of their use\r\nas hospitals for the aged and infirm, the poor-houses are principally\r\nemployed as the club-houses and hotels of the great fraternity of\r\nhabitual tramps and cadgers; and not till he has sunk to this level\r\ndoes the struggling proletarian seek “work” there.\r\n\r\nSocialists would realize the idea of the Poor Law, regarding that\r\nsociety as deadly sick in which the individual cannot find subsistence\r\nby industry, in the only way in which it can be realised: namely, by\r\nthe organisation of production and the resumption of its necessary\r\ninstruments. It is not so great a matter in their eyes that the\r\nperpetual toll of rent and interest deprives the workers of the wealth\r\nwhich their activities produce; nor is it the actual pressure of this\r\nheavy tribute that would force on the Social Revolution, if the\r\nsystem only left men the assurance of the comforts of tame beasts. It\r\nis the constant disquiet and uncertainty, the increasing frequency of\r\nindustrial crises, that are the revolutionary preachers of our age; and\r\nit is the disappearance at the base and at the summit of society of the\r\nconditions of social morality, that rouses those whose mere material\r\ninterests remain unaffected.\r\n\r\nBut though it is not envy or resentment at this tribute that mostly\r\nmoves us to our warfare, this tribute we must certainly resume if the\r\nideal of the school is to effect its social purpose. For the ideal of\r\nthe school implies, in the first place, leisure to learn: that is to\r\nsay, the release of children from all non-educational labor until mind\r\nand physique have had a fair start and training, and the abolition of\r\ncompulsion on the adult to work any more than the socially necessary\r\nstint. The actual expenditure on public education must also be\r\nconsiderably increased, at any rate until parents are more generally\r\nin a position to instruct their own children. But as soon as the mind\r\nhas been trained to appreciate the inexhaustible interest and beauty of\r\nthe world, and to distinguish good literature from bad, the remainder\r\nof education, granted leisure, is a comparatively inexpensive matter.\r\nLiterature is become dirt-cheap; and all the other educational arts can\r\nbe communally enjoyed. The schools of the adult are the journal and the\r\nlibrary, social intercourse, fresh air, clean and beautiful cities,\r\nthe joy of the fields, the museum, the art-gallery, the lecture-hall,\r\nthe drama, and the opera; and only when these schools are free and\r\naccessible to all will the reproach of proletarian coarseness be done\r\naway.\r\n\r\nYet the most important influence in the repairing of social morality\r\nmay perhaps be looked for not so much from the direct action of\r\nthese elements of the higher education, as from those very socialist\r\nforms of property and industry, which we believe to be the primary\r\ncondition for allowing such higher education to affect the majority at\r\nall. Nothing so well trains the individual to identify his life with\r\nthe life of society as the identification of the conditions of his\r\nmaterial sustenance with those of his fellows, in short, as industrial\r\nco-operation. Not for many centuries has there been such compulsion as\r\nnow for the individual to acknowledge a social ethic. For now, for the\r\nfirst time since the dissolution of the early tribal communisms, and\r\nover areas a hundred times wider than theirs, the individual worker\r\nearns his living, fulfils his most elementary desire, not by direct\r\npersonal production, but by an intricate co-operation in which the\r\neffect and value of his personal effort are almost indistinguishable.\r\nThe apology for individualist appropriation is exploded by the logic\r\nof the facts of communist production: no man can pretend to claim the\r\nfruits of his own labor; for his whole ability and opportunity for\r\nworking are plainly a vast inheritance and contribution of which he is\r\nbut a transient and accidental beneficiary and steward; and his power\r\nof turning them to his own account depends entirely upon the desires\r\nand needs of other people for his services. The factory system, the\r\nmachine industry, the world commerce, have abolished individualist\r\nproduction; and the completion of the co-operative form towards which\r\nthe transition stage of individualist capitalism is hurrying us, will\r\nrender a conformity with social ethics, a universal condition of\r\ntolerable existence for the individual.\r\n\r\nThis expectation is already justified by the phenomena of contemporary\r\nopinion. The moral ideas appropriate to Socialism are permeating the\r\nwhole of modern society. They are clearly recognisable not only in\r\nthe proletariat, but also in the increasing philanthropic activity of\r\nmembers of the propertied class, who, while denouncing Socialism as a\r\ndangerous exaggeration of what is necessary for social health, work\r\nhonestly enough for alleviatory reforms which converge irresistibly\r\ntowards it. The form, perhaps, does not outrun the spirit, any more\r\nthan the spirit anticipates the form; and it may have been sufficient\r\nin this paper to have shown some grounds for the conviction that\r\nSocialist morality, like that of all preceding systems, is only that\r\nmorality which the conditions of human existence have made necessary;\r\nthat it is only the expression of the eternal passion of life seeking\r\nits satisfaction through the striving of each individual for the\r\nfreest and fullest activity; that Socialism is but a stage in the\r\nunending progression out of the weakness and the ignorance in which\r\nsociety and the individual alike are born, towards the strength and\r\nthe enlightenment in which they can see and choose their own way\r\nforward--from the chaos where morality is not to the consciousness\r\nwhich sees that morality is reason; and to have made some attempt to\r\njustify the claim that the cardinal virtue of Socialism is nothing else\r\nthan Common Sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[66] “The Quintessence of Socialism.” Swan, Sonnenschein and Co.\r\n\r\n[67] _E.

But against the non-Socialist who employs it, it may be\r\nlegitimately used, _ad captandum_.\r\n\r\n[69] See _National Review_ for February, 1888, “Are Rich Landowners\r\nIdle?” by Lady Janetta Manners (now Duchess of Rutland).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTY UNDER SOCIALISM.\r\n\r\nBY GRAHAM WALLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Socialism no one who was not ready with a complete\r\ndescription of Society as it ought to be, dared come forward to\r\nexplain any point in the theory. Each leader had his own method of\r\norganising property, education, domestic life, and the production of\r\nwealth. Each was quite sure that mankind had only to fashion themselves\r\nafter his model in order, like the prince and princess in the fairy\r\nstory, to live happily ever after. Every year would then be like the\r\nyear before; and no more history need be written. Even now a thinker\r\nhere and there like Gronlund or Bebel sketches in the old spirit an\r\nideal commonwealth; though he does so with an apology for attempting\r\nto forecast the unknowable. But Socialists generally have become, if\r\nnot wiser than their spiritual fathers, at least less willing to use\r\ntheir imagination. The growing recognition, due in part to Darwin,\r\nof causation in the development of individuals and societies; the\r\nstruggles and disappointments of half a century of agitation; the\r\nsteady introduction of Socialistic institutions by men who reject\r\nSocialist ideas, all incline us to give up any expectation of a final\r\nand perfect reform. We are more apt to regard the slow and often\r\nunconscious progress of the Time spirit as the only adequate cause of\r\nsocial progress, and to attempt rather to discover and proclaim what\r\nthe future _must_ be, than to form an organisation of men determined to\r\nmake the future what it should be.\r\n\r\nBut the new conception of Socialism has its dangers as well as the old.\r\nFifty years ago Socialists were tempted to exaggerate the influence\r\nof the ideal, to expect everything from a sudden impossible change of\r\nall mens’ hearts. Nowadays we are tempted to under-value the ideal--to\r\nforget that even the Time spirit itself is only the sum of individual\r\nstrivings and aspirations, and that again and again in history changes\r\nwhich might have been delayed for centuries or might never have come at\r\nall, have been brought about by the persistent preaching of some new\r\nand higher life, the offspring not of circumstance but of hope. And of\r\nall the subjects upon which men require to be brought to a right mind\r\nand a clear understanding, there is, Socialists think, none more vital\r\nto-day than Property.\r\n\r\nThe word Property has been used in nearly as many senses as the word\r\nLaw. The best definition I have met with is John Austin’s “any right\r\nwhich gives to the entitled party such a power or liberty of using\r\nor disposing of the subject ... as is merely limited generally by\r\nthe rights of all other persons.”[70] This applies only to private\r\nproperty. It will be convenient in discussing the various claims of the\r\nState, the municipality, and the individual, to use the word in a wider\r\nsense to denote not only the “power or liberty” of the individual, but\r\nalso the “rights of all other persons.” In this sense I shall speak\r\nof the property of the State or municipality. I shall also draw a\r\ndistinction, economic perhaps rather than legal, between property in\r\nthings, or the exclusive right of access to defined material objects,\r\nproperty in debts and future services, and property in ideas (copyright\r\nand patent right).\r\n\r\nThe material things in which valuable property rights can exist, may\r\nbe roughly divided into means of production and means of consumption.\r\nAmong those lowest tribes of savages who feed on fruit and insects,\r\nand build themselves at night a rough shelter with boughs of trees,\r\nthere is little distinction between the acts of production and\r\nconsumption. But in a populous and civilised country very few even of\r\nthe simplest wants of men are satisfied directly by nature. Nearly\r\nevery commodity which man consumes is produced and renewed by the\r\ndeliberate application of human industry to material objects. The\r\ngeneral stock of materials on which such industry works is “Land.” Any\r\nmaterials which have been separated from the general stock or have\r\nbeen already considerably modified by industry, are called capital\r\nif they are either to be used to aid production or are still to be\r\nworked on before they are consumed. When they are ready to be consumed\r\nthey are “wealth for consumption.” Such an analysis, though generally\r\nemployed by political economists, is of necessity very rough. No one\r\ncan tell whether an object is ready for immediate consumption or not,\r\nunless he knows the way in which it is to be consumed. A pine forest\r\nin its natural condition is ready for the consumption of a duke with\r\na taste for the picturesque; for he will let the trees rot before\r\nhis eyes. Cotton-wool, a finished product in the hands of a doctor,\r\nis raw material in the hands of a spinner. But still the statement\r\nthat Socialists work for the owning of the means of production by the\r\ncommunity and the means of consumption by individuals, represents\r\nfairly enough their practical aim. Not that they desire to prevent\r\nthe community from using its property whenever it will for direct\r\nconsumption, as, for instance, when a piece of common land is used\r\nfor a public park, or the profits of municipal waterworks are applied\r\nto keep up a municipal library. Nor do they contemplate any need for\r\npreventing individuals from working at will on their possessions in\r\nsuch a way as to make them more valuable. Even Gronlund, with all\r\nhis hatred of private industry, could not, if he would, prevent any\r\ncitizen from driving a profitable trade by manufacturing bread into\r\nbuttered toast at the common fire. But men are as yet more fit for\r\nassociation in production, with a just distribution of its rewards,\r\nthan for association in the consumption of the wealth produced. It is\r\ntrue indeed that the economies of associated consumption promise to be\r\nquite as great as those of associated production; and it was of these\r\nthat the earlier Socialists mainly thought. They believed always that\r\nif a few hundred persons could be induced to throw their possessions\r\nand earnings into a common stock to be employed according to a common\r\nscheme, a heaven on earth would be created. Since then, an exhaustive\r\nseries of experiments has proved that in spite of its obvious economy\r\nany system of associated consumption as complete as Fourier’s\r\n“Phalanstère” or Owen’s “New Hampshire” is, except under very unusual\r\nconditions, distasteful to most men as they now are. Our picture\r\ngalleries, parks, workmen’s clubs, or the fact that rich people are\r\nbeginning to live in flats looked after by a common staff of servants,\r\ndo indeed shew that associated consumption is every year better\r\nunderstood and enjoyed; but it remains true that pleasures chosen by\r\nthe will of the majority are often not recognised as pleasures at all.\r\n\r\nAs long as this is so, private property and even private industry must\r\nexist along with public property and public production. For instance,\r\neach family now insists on having a separate home, and on cooking\r\nevery day a separate series of meals in a separate kitchen. Waste\r\nand discomfort are the inevitable result; but families at present\r\nprefer waste and discomfort to that abundance which can only be bought\r\nby organisation and publicity. Again, English families constitute\r\nat present isolated communistic groups, more or less despotically\r\ngoverned. Our growing sense of the individual responsibility and\r\nindividual rights of wives and children seems already to be lessening\r\nboth the isolation of these groups and their internal coherency; but\r\nthis tendency must go very much further before society can absorb the\r\nfamily life, or the industries of the home be managed socially. Thus,\r\nassociated production of all the means of family life may be developed\r\nto a very high degree before we cease to feel that an Englishman’s\r\nhome should be his castle, with free entrance and free egress alike\r\nforbidden. It is true that the ground on which houses are built\r\ncould immediately become the property of the community; and when one\r\nremembers how most people in England are now lodged, it is obvious that\r\nthey would gladly inhabit comfortable houses built and owned by the\r\nState. But they certainly would at present insist on having their own\r\ncrockery and chairs, books and pictures, and on receiving a certain\r\nproportion of the value they produce in the form of a yearly or weekly\r\nincome to be spent or saved as they pleased. Now whatever things of\r\nthis kind we allow a man to possess, we must allow him to exchange,\r\nsince exchange never takes place unless both parties believe themselves\r\nto benefit by it. Further, bequest must be allowed, since any but a\r\nmoderate probate duty or personalty would, unless supported by a strong\r\nand searching public opinion, certainly be evaded. Moreover, if we\r\ndesire the personal independence of women and children, then their\r\nproperty, as far as we allow property at all, must for a long time to\r\ncome be most carefully guarded.\r\n\r\nThere would remain therefore to be owned by the community the land\r\nin the widest sense of the word, and the materials of those forms of\r\nproduction, distribution, and consumption, which can conveniently be\r\ncarried on by associations larger than the family group. Here the main\r\nproblem is to fix in each case the area of ownership. In the case of\r\nthe principal means of communication and of some forms of industry, it\r\nhas been proved that the larger the area controlled, the greater is the\r\nefficiency of management; so that the postal and railway systems, and\r\nprobably the materials of some of the larger industries, would be owned\r\nby the English nation until that distant date when they might pass to\r\nthe United States or the British Empire, or the Federal Republic of\r\nEurope. Land is perhaps generally better held by smaller social units.\r\nThe rent of a town or an agricultural district depends only partly on\r\nthose natural advantages which can be easily estimated once for all\r\nby an imperial commissioner. The difference in the rateable value of\r\nWarwick and of Birmingham is due, not so much to the sites of the two\r\ntowns, as to the difference in the industry and character of their\r\ninhabitants. If the Birmingham men prefer, on the average, intense\r\nexertion resulting in great material wealth, to the simpler and quieter\r\nlife lived at Warwick, it is obviously as unjust to allow the Warwick\r\nmen to share equally in the Birmingham ground rents, as it would be\r\nto insist on one standard of comfort being maintained in Paris and in\r\nBrittany.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, those forms of natural wealth which are the\r\nnecessities of the whole nation and the monopolies of certain\r\ndistricts, mines for instance, or harbors, or sources of water-supply,\r\nmust be “nationalised.” The salt and coal rings of to-day would be\r\nequally possible and equally inconvenient under a system which made the\r\nmining populations absolute joint owners of the mines. Even where the\r\nland was absolutely owned by local bodies, those bodies would still\r\nhave to contribute to the national exchequer some proportion of their\r\nincome. The actual size of the units would in each case be fixed by\r\nconvenience; and it is very likely that the development of the County\r\nGovernment Act and of the parochial and municipal systems will soon\r\nprovide us with units of government which could easily be turned into\r\nunits of ownership.\r\n\r\nThe savings of communities--if I may use the word community to express\r\nany Social Democratic unit from the parish to the nation--would\r\nprobably take much the same form that the accumulation of capital\r\ntakes nowadays: that is to say, they would consist partly of mills,\r\nmachinery, railways, schools, and the other specialised materials\r\nof future industry, and partly of a stock of commodities such as\r\nfood, clothing, and money, by which workers might be supported\r\nwhile performing work not immediately remunerative. The savings of\r\nindividuals would consist partly of consumable commodities or of the\r\nmeans of such industry as had not been socialised, and partly of\r\ndeferred pay for services rendered to the community, such pay taking\r\nthe form of a pension due at a certain age, or of a sum of commodities\r\nor money payable on demand.\r\n\r\nVoluntary associations of all kinds, whether joint-stock companies,\r\nreligious corporations, or communistic groups would, in the eyes of\r\nthe Social Democratic State, consist simply of so many individuals\r\npossessing those rights of property which are allowed to individuals.\r\nThey might perform many very useful functions in the future as in the\r\npast; but the history of the city companies, of the New River company,\r\nthe Rochdale Pioneers, or the Church of England shows the danger of\r\ngranting perpetual property rights to any association not co-extensive\r\nwith the community, although such association may exist for professedly\r\nphilanthropic objects. Even in the case of universities, where the\r\nsystem of independent property-owning corporations has been found\r\nto work best, the rights of the State should be delegated and not\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nOn this point the economic position of modern Social Democrats differs\r\nwidely from the transfigured joint stockism of the present co-operative\r\nmovement or from the object of the earlier Socialists, for whose\r\npurposes complete community was always more important than complete\r\ninclusiveness. Even Socialist writers of to-day do not always see\r\nthat the grouping of the citizens for the purpose of property holding\r\nmust be either on the joint-stock basis or on the territorial basis.\r\nGronlund, in spite of contradictory matter in other parts of his\r\n“Co-operative Commonwealth,” still declares that “each group of workers\r\nwill have the power of distributing among themselves the whole exchange\r\nvalue of their work,” which either means that they will, as long as\r\nthey are working, be the absolute joint owners of the materials which\r\nthey use, or means nothing at all. Now the proposal that any voluntary\r\nassociation of citizens should hold absolute and perpetual property\r\nrights in the means of production, seems to be not a step towards\r\nSocial Democracy, but a negation of the whole Social Democratic\r\nidea. This of course brings us to the following difficulty. If our\r\ncommunities even when originally inclusive of the whole population\r\nare closed: that is, are confined to original members and their\r\ndescendants, new comers will form a class like the plebians in Rome,\r\nor the “metoeci” in Athens, without a share in the common property\r\nthough possessed of full personal freedom; and such a class must be a\r\ncontinual social danger. On the other hand, if all newcomers receive\r\nat once full economic rights, then any country in which Socialism\r\nor anything approaching it is established, will be at once over-run\r\nby proletarian immigrants, from those countries in which the means\r\nof production are still strictly monopolised. If this were allowed,\r\nthen, through the operation of the law of diminishing return and the\r\nlaw of population based on it, the whole body of the inhabitants\r\neven of a Socialist State, might conceivably be finally brought down\r\nto the bare means of subsistence. It does not seem necessary to\r\nconclude that Socialism must be established over the whole globe if\r\nit is to be established anywhere. What is necessary is that we face\r\nthe fact, every day becoming plainer, that any determined attempt to\r\nraise the condition of the proletariat in any single European country\r\nmust be accompanied by a law of aliens considerate enough to avoid\r\ncruelty to refugees, or obstruction to those whose presence would\r\nraise our intellectual or industrial average, but stringent enough to\r\nexclude the unhappy “diluvies gentium,” the human rubbish which the\r\nmilitary empires of the continent are so ready to shoot upon any open\r\nspace. Such a law would be in itself an evil. It might be unfairly\r\nadministered; it might increase national selfishness and would probably\r\nendanger international good will; it would require the drawing of a\r\ngreat many very difficult lines of distinction; but no sufficient\r\nargument has been yet advanced to disprove the necessity of it.\r\n\r\nOn the question of private property in debts, the attitude of the law\r\nin Europe has changed fundamentally in historical times. Under the\r\nold Roman law, the creditor became the absolute owner of his debtor.\r\nNowadays, not only may a man by becoming bankrupt and surrendering all\r\nhis visible property, repudiate his debts and yet retain his personal\r\nliberty; but in Factory Acts, Employers’ Liability Acts, Irish Land\r\nActs, etc., certain contracts are illegal under all circumstances.\r\nWith the growth of Socialism, this tendency would be quickened. The\r\nlaw would look with extreme jealously upon any agreement by which one\r\nparty would be reduced even for a time to a condition of slavery,\r\nor the other enabled to live even for a time without performing any\r\nuseful social function. And since it has been clearly recognised that\r\na certain access to the means of industry is a first condition of\r\npersonal freedom, the law would refuse to recognise any agreement to\r\ndebar a man from such access, or deprive him of the results of it.\r\nNo one would need to get into debt in order to provide himself with\r\nthe opportunity of work, nor would anyone be allowed to give up the\r\nopportunity of work in order to obtain a loan. This, by making it more\r\ndifficult for creditors to recover debts, would also make it more\r\ndifficult for would-be debtors to obtain credit. The present homestead\r\nlaw would, in fact, be extended to include everything which the State\r\nthought necessary for a complete life. But as long as private industry\r\nand exchange go on to such an extent as to make a private commercial\r\nsystem convenient, so long will promises to pay circulate, and, if\r\nnecessary, be legally enforced under the conditions above marked out.\r\n\r\nTo whatever extent private property is permitted, to that same extent\r\nthe private taking of Rent and Interest must be also permitted. If you\r\nallow a selfish man to own a picture by Raphael, he will lock it up\r\nin his own room unless you let him charge something for the privilege\r\nof looking at it. Such a charge is at once Interest. If we wish all\r\nRaphael’s pictures to be freely accessible to everyone, we must prevent\r\nmen not merely from exhibiting them for payment, but from owning them.\r\n\r\nThis argument applies to other things besides Raphael’s pictures.\r\nIf we allow a man to own a printing press, or a plough, or a set of\r\nbookbinders’ tools, or a lease of a house or farm, we must allow him so\r\nto employ his possession that he may, without injuring his neighbor,\r\nget from it the greatest possible advantage. Otherwise, seeing that the\r\ncommunity is not responsible for its intelligent use, any interference\r\non the part of the community may well result in no intelligent use\r\nbeing made of it at all; in which event all privately owned materials\r\nof industry not actually being used by their owners would be as\r\nentirely wasted as if they were the subjects of a chancery suit. It\r\nis easy to see that the Duke of Bedford is robbing the community of\r\nthe rent of Covent Garden. It is not so easy to see that the owners\r\nof the vacant land adjoining Shaftesbury Avenue have been robbing the\r\ncommunity for some years past of the rent which ought to have been\r\nmade out of the sites which they have left desolate. I know that it\r\nhas been sometimes said by Socialists: “Let us allow the manufacturer\r\nto keep his mill and the Duke of Argyle to keep his land, as long as\r\nthey do not use them for exploitation by letting them out to others on\r\ncondition of receiving a part of the wealth created by those others.”\r\nThen, we are told, the manufacturer or Duke will soon discover that he\r\nmust work hard for a living. Such sentiments are seldom ill received\r\nby men in the humor to see dukes and capitalists earning, as painfully\r\nas may be, their daily bread. Unluckily, there are no unappropriated\r\nacres and factory sites in England sufficiently advantageous to be used\r\nas efficient substitutes for those upon which private property has\r\nfastened; and the community would be wise if it paid the Duke of Argyle\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain anything short of the full economic rent of their\r\nproperties rather than go further and fare worse. Therefore, if we\r\nrefused either to allow these gentlemen to let their property to those\r\nwho would use it, or hesitated to take it and use it for ourselves,\r\nwe should be actually wasting labor. The progressive socialisation of\r\nland and capital must proceed by direct transference of them to the\r\ncommunity through taxation of rent and interest and public organisation\r\nof labor with the capital so obtained; not solely by a series of\r\nrestrictions upon their use in private exploitation. Such concurrent\r\nprivate exploitation, however unrestricted, could not in any case bring\r\nback the old evils of capitalism; for any change in the habits of the\r\npeople or in the methods of industry which made associated production\r\nof any commodity on a large scale convenient and profitable, would\r\nresult at once in the taking over of that industry by the State exactly\r\nas the same conditions now in America result at once in the formation\r\nof a ring.\r\n\r\nIt is because full ownership is necessary to the most intelligent and\r\neffective use of any materials, that no mere system of taxation of\r\nRent and Interest, even when so drastic as Mr. Henry George’s scheme\r\nof universal State absentee landlordism, is likely to exist except as\r\na transition stage towards Social Democracy. Indeed the anarchist idea\r\nwhich allows the State to receive Rent and Interest, but forbids it to\r\nemploy labor, is obviously impracticable. Unless we are willing to pay\r\nevery citizen in hard cash a share of the State Rent of the future,\r\nit, like the taxes of to-day, must be wholly invested in payments for\r\nwork done. It would always be a very serious difficulty for a Socialist\r\nlegislature to decide how far communities should be allowed to incur\r\ndebts or pay interest. Socialism once established, the chief danger\r\nto its stability would be just at this point. We all know the inept\r\nattack on Socialism which comes from a debating-society orator who\r\nconsiders the subject for the first time, or from the cultured person\r\nwho has been brought up on the _Saturday Review_. He tells us that if\r\nproperty were equally divided to-morrow, there would be for the next\r\nten years forty men out of every hundred working extremely hard, and\r\nthe other sixty lazy. After that time, the sixty would have to work\r\nhard and keep the forty, who would then be as lazy as the sixty were\r\nbefore. It is very easy to explain that we do not want to divide all\r\nproperty equally; but it is not so easy to guard against any result\r\nof that tendency in human nature on which the argument is grounded.\r\nMen differ so widely in their comparative appreciation of present and\r\nfuture pleasures, that wherever life can be supported by four hours’\r\nwork a day, there will always be some men anxious to work eight hours\r\nin order to secure future benefits for themselves or their children,\r\nand others anxious to avoid their four hours’ work for the present\r\nby pledging themselves or their children to any degree of future\r\nprivation. As long as this is so, communities as well as individuals\r\nwill be tempted to avail themselves of the freely offered services of\r\nthe exceptionally energetic and farsighted, and to incur a common debt\r\nunder the excuse that they are spreading the payment of such services\r\nover all those benefited by them. The municipalities, Boards of Works,\r\nSchool Boards, etc., of England have already created enormous local\r\ndebts; and unless men grow wiser in the next few months the new County\r\nCouncils will probably add to the burden. As we sit and think, it may\r\nseem easy to prevent any such trouble in the future by a law forbidding\r\ncommunities to incur debts under any circumstances. But in the case\r\nof a central and supreme government such a law would, of course,\r\nbe an absurdity. No nation can escape a national debt or any other\r\ncalamity if the majority in that nation desire to submit to it. It is\r\nreassuring to see how the feeling that national governments should\r\npay their way from year to year grows stronger and stronger. National\r\ndebts no longer even in France go up with the old light-hearted leaps\r\nand bounds. But local debts still increase. In Preston the local debt\r\nis said to amount to seven times the annual rating valuation. And\r\nalthough at present (November, 1888), since the “surf at the edge of\r\ncivilisation” is only thundering to the extent of three small colonial\r\nwars, our own national debt is slowly going down; still if war were\r\ndeclared to-morrow with any European State no ministry would dare to\r\nraise all the war expenses by immediate taxation either on incomes\r\nor on property. It may be objected that no such danger would arise\r\nunder Socialism; for there would be no fund from which a loan could be\r\noffered that would not be equally easily reached by a direct levy. But\r\nif we are speaking of society in the near future there would certainly\r\nbe plenty of members of non-Socialist States, or English holders of\r\nproperty in them, ready to lend money on good security to a timid or\r\ndesperate or dishonest Socialist government. Again, in times of extreme\r\nstress a government might believe itself to require even personal\r\npossessions; and it might be difficult under such circumstances not to\r\noffer to restore them with or without interest. In any case there would\r\nbe no more economic difference between the new fund-holders and the old\r\nlandlords than between Lord Salisbury as owner of the Strand district\r\nand Lord Salisbury now that he has sold his slums and bought consols.\r\nPerhaps the most serious danger of the creation of a common debt would\r\narise from the earnings of exceptional ability. Modern Socialists have\r\nlearnt, after a long series of co-operative experiments and failures,\r\nthat the profits of private adventure will withdraw men of exceptional\r\nbusiness talent from communal service unless work of varying scarcity\r\nand intensity is paid for at varying rates. How great this variation\r\nneed be in order to ensure full efficiency can only be decided by\r\nexperience, and as the education and moralisation of society improves,\r\nand industry becomes so thoroughly socialised that the alternative of\r\nprivate enterprise will be less practicable, something like equality\r\nmay at last be found possible. But, meanwhile, comparatively large\r\nincomes will be earned by men leading busy and useful lives, but often\r\nkeenly anxious to secure leisure and comfort for their old age and\r\naggrandisement for their family.[71] I have already suggested that some\r\nof the earnings of a man employed by the community might be left for\r\na time in the common treasury to accumulate without interest. Now, it\r\nwould suit both these men and the lazier of their contemporaries that\r\nthe reward of their services should be fixed at a very high rate, and\r\nbe left to the next generation for payment; while the next generation\r\nmight prefer a small permanent charge to any attempt to pay off the\r\ncapital sum. It is often hinted that one way to obviate this would be\r\nfor each generation to cultivate a healthy indifference to the debts\r\nincurred on its behalf by its forefathers. But the citizens of each new\r\ngeneration attain citizenship not in large bodies at long intervals,\r\nbut in small numbers every week. One has only to warn sanguine lenders\r\nthat veiled repudiations may always be effected in such emergencies\r\nby a judicious application of the Income Tax, and to hope that the\r\nprogress of education under Socialism would tend to produce and\r\npreserve on such matters a certain general minimum of common sense. If\r\nthis minimum is sufficient to control the central government the debts\r\nof local bodies can be easily and sternly restricted.\r\n\r\nProperty in services means of course property in future services. The\r\nwealth which past services may have produced can be exchanged or owned;\r\nbut the services themselves cannot. Now all systems of law which we\r\nknow have allowed private persons to contract with each other for the\r\nfuture performance of certain services, and have punished, or allowed\r\nto be punished, the breach of such contracts. Here as in the case\r\nof debts, our growing respect for personal liberty has made the law\r\nlook jealously on all onerous agreements made either by the citizen\r\nhimself or for him by others. In fact, as Professor Sidgwick points\r\nout: “In England hardly any engagement to render personal service gives\r\nthe promisee a legal claim to more than pecuniary damages--to put it\r\notherwise, almost all such contracts, if unfulfilled, turn into mere\r\ndebts of money so far as their legal force goes.”[72] The marriage\r\ncontract forms the principal exception to this rule; but even in this\r\ncase there seems to be a tendency in most European countries to relax\r\nthe rigidity of the law.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the direct claims of the State to the services of its\r\ncitizens shew at present no signs of diminishing. Compulsory military\r\nservice and compulsory attendance at school already take up a not\r\ninconsiderable share of the life of every male inhabitant of France\r\nand Germany. So far in England the compulsion of grown men to serve\r\nin any capacity has been condemned for a century past, because it is\r\nconsidered wasteful and oppressive as compared with the free contract\r\nsystem of the open market. Most English Socialists seem inclined to\r\nbelieve that all work for the State should be voluntarily engaged and\r\npaid for out of the produce of common industry.\r\n\r\nIn considering how far the State has a claim upon the services of its\r\nmembers, we come upon the much larger question--How far are we working\r\nfor Socialism; and how far for Communism? Under pure Socialism, to use\r\nthe word in its narrowest sense, the State would offer no advantage at\r\nall to any citizen except at a price sufficient to pay all the expenses\r\nof producing it. In this sense the Post Office, for example, is now a\r\npurely Socialistic institution. Under such conditions the State would\r\nhave no claim at all on the services of its members; and compulsion to\r\nwork would be produced by the fact that if a man chose not to work he\r\nwould be in danger of starvation. Under pure Communism, on the other\r\nhand, as defined by Louis Blanc’s dictum: “From every man according\r\nto his powers; to every man according to his wants,” the State would\r\nsatisfy without stint and without price all the reasonable wants\r\nof any citizen. Our present drinking fountains are examples of the\r\nnumerous cases of pure communism which surround us. But since nothing\r\ncan be made without labor, the commodities provided by the State must\r\nbe produced by the services, voluntary or forced, of the citizens.\r\nUnder pure communism, if any compulsion to work were needed, it would\r\nhave to be direct. Some communistic institutions we must have; and\r\nas a matter of fact there is an increasing number of them already in\r\nEngland. Indeed, if the whole or any part of that Rent Fund which is\r\ndue to the difference between the best and worst materials of industry\r\nin use be taken for the State, by taxation or otherwise, it, or rather\r\nthe advantages produced by its expenditure, can hardly be distributed\r\notherwise than communistically. For, as men are now, saturated with\r\nimmoral principles by our commercial system, the State would have to be\r\nexceedingly careful in deciding what wants could be freely satisfied\r\nwithout making direct compulsion to labor necessary. It would cost\r\nby no means an impossible sum to supply a tolerable shelter with a\r\nbed, and a sufficient daily portion of porridge, or bread and cheese,\r\nor even of gin and water, to each citizen; but no sane man would\r\npropose to do so in the existing state of public morals. For more than\r\na century the proletarians of Europe have been challenged by their\r\nmasters to do as little work as they can. They have been taught by\r\nthe practical economists of the Trades Unions, and have learnt for\r\nthemselves by bitter experience, that every time any of them in a\r\nmoment of ambition or goodwill does one stroke of work not in his bond,\r\nhe is increasing the future unpaid labor not only of himself but of his\r\nfellows. At the same time every circumstance of monotony, ugliness, and\r\nanxiety has made the work as wearisome and disgusting as possible. All,\r\nalmost without exception, now look upon the working day as a period of\r\nslavery, and find such happiness as they can get only in a few hours\r\nor minutes that intervene between work and sleep. For a few, that\r\nhappiness consists in added toil of thought and speech in the cause\r\nof themselves and their comrades. The rest care only for such rough\r\npleasures as are possible to men both poor and over-worked. There would\r\nbe plenty of excuse if under these circumstances they dreamt, as they\r\nare accused of dreaming, of some universal division of the good things\r\nof the earth--of some means of being utterly at leisure, if only for a\r\nweek or two.\r\n\r\nBut there are products of labor which the workmen in their time of\r\ntriumph might freely offer each other without causing the weakest\r\nbrother to forego any form of useful social work. Among such products\r\nare those ideas which we have brought under the dominion of private\r\nproperty by means of copyright and patent right. Luckily for us the\r\ndominion is neither complete nor permanent. If the Whig landlords who\r\nare responsible for most of the details of our glorious constitution\r\nhad been also authors and inventors for profit, we should probably\r\nhave had the strictest rights of perpetual property or even of entail\r\nin ideas; and there would now have been a Duke of Shakspere to whom\r\nwe should all have had to pay two or three pounds for the privilege\r\nof reading his ancestor’s works, provided that we return the copy\r\nuninjured at the end of a fortnight. But even for the years during\r\nwhich copyright and patents now last, the system which allows an author\r\nor inventor a monopoly in his ideas is a stupid and ineffective way\r\neither of paying for his work or of satisfying the public wants. In\r\neach case the author or inventor obtains a maximum nett return by\r\nleaving unsatisfied the wants, certainly of many, probably of most of\r\nthose who desire to read his book or use his invention. We all know\r\nthat the public got a very good bargain when it paid the owners of\r\nWaterloo Bridge more than they could possibly have made by any scheme\r\nof tolls. In the same way it is certain that any government which aimed\r\nat the greatest happiness of the greatest number could afford to pay a\r\ncapable artist or author possibly even more than he gets from the rich\r\nmen who are his present patrons, and certainly more than he could get\r\nby himself selling or exhibiting his productions in a society where\r\nfew possessed wealth for which they had not worked. Although the State\r\ncould thus afford to pay an extravagantly large reward for certain\r\nforms of intellectual labor, it does not therefore follow that it would\r\nbe obliged to do so in the absence of any other important bidder.\r\n\r\nThere would always remain the sick, the infirm, and the school\r\nchildren, whose wants could be satisfied from the general stock without\r\nasking them to bear any part of the general burden. In particular, it\r\nwould be well to teach the children by actual experience the economy\r\nand happiness which arise in the case of those who are fitly trained\r\nfrom association applied to the direct satisfaction of wants, as well\r\nas from association in the manufacture of material wealth. If we\r\nwish to wean the children from the selfish isolation of the English\r\nfamily, from the worse than savage habits produced by four generations\r\nof capitalism, from that longing for excitement, and incapacity for\r\nreasonable enjoyment, which are the natural results of workdays spent\r\nin English factories, and English Sundays spent in English streets,\r\nthen we must give freely and generously to our schools. If this\r\ngeneration were wise it would spend on education not only more than any\r\nother generation has ever spent before, but more than any generation\r\nwould ever need to spend again. It would fill the school buildings\r\nwith the means not only of comfort, but even of the higher luxury;\r\nit would serve the associated meals on tables spread with flowers,\r\nin halls surrounded with beautiful pictures, or even, as John Milton\r\nproposed, filled with the sounds of music; it would seriously propose\r\nto itself the ideal of Ibsen, that every child should be brought up as\r\na nobleman. Unfortunately, this generation is not wise.\r\n\r\nIn considering the degree in which common owning of property would be\r\npossible among a people just at that stage of industrial and moral\r\ndevelopment at which we now find ourselves, it is expedient to dwell,\r\nas I have dwelt, rather upon the necessary difficulties and limitations\r\nof Socialism, than upon its hopes of future development. But we must\r\nalways remember that the problems which Socialism attempts to solve,\r\ndeal with conditions which themselves are constantly changing. Just as\r\nanything like what we call Socialism would be impossible in a nation\r\nof individualist savages like the Australian blacks, and could not,\r\nperhaps, be introduced except by external authority among a people like\r\nthe peasants of Brittany, for whom the prospect of absolute property\r\nin any portion of land, however small, is at once their strongest\r\npleasure and their only sufficient incentive to industry; so among a\r\npeople further advanced, socially and industrially, than ourselves, a\r\nsocial condition would be possible which we do not now dare to work\r\nfor or even try to realise. The tentative and limited Social-Democracy\r\nwhich I have sketched is the necessary and certain step to that better\r\nlife which we hope for. The interests which each man has in common with\r\nhis fellows tend more and more to outweigh those which are peculiar\r\nto himself. We see the process even now beginning. Already, as soon\r\nas a public library is started, the workman finds how poor a means\r\nfor the production of happiness are the few books on his own shelf,\r\ncompared with the share he has in the public collection, though that\r\nshare may have cost even less to produce. In the same way the score or\r\ntwo of pounds which a workman may possess are becoming daily of less\r\nand less advantage in production; so that the man who a few years ago\r\nwould have worked by himself as a small capitalist, goes now to work\r\nfor wages in some great business, and treats his little savings as a\r\nfund to provide for a few months of sickness or years of old age. He\r\nwill soon see how poor a means for the production of food is his own\r\nfire when compared with the public kitchen; and he will perhaps at\r\nlast not only get his clothes from the public store, but the delight\r\nof his eyes from the public galleries and theatres, the delight of his\r\nears from the public opera, and it may be, when our present anarchy\r\nof opinion be overpast, the refreshment of his mind from the publicly\r\nchosen teacher. Then at last such a life will be possible for all as\r\nnot even the richest and most powerful can live to-day. The system of\r\nproperty holding which we call Socialism is not in itself such a life\r\nany more than a good system of drainage is health, or the invention\r\nof printing is knowledge. Nor indeed is Socialism the only condition\r\nnecessary to produce complete human happiness. Under the justest\r\npossible social system we might still have to face all those vices and\r\ndiseases which are not the direct result of poverty and over-work; we\r\nmight still suffer all the mental anguish and bewilderment which are\r\ncaused, some say by religious belief, others by religious doubt; we\r\nmight still witness outbursts of national hatred and the degradation\r\nand extinction of weaker peoples; we might still make earth a hell for\r\nevery species except our own. But in the households of the five men out\r\nof six in England who live by weekly wage, Socialism would indeed be\r\na new birth of happiness. The long hours of work done as in a convict\r\nprison, without interest and without hope; the dreary squalor of their\r\nhomes; above all that grievous uncertainty, that constant apprehension\r\nof undeserved misfortune which is the peculiar result of capitalist\r\nproduction: all this would be gone; and education, refinement, leisure,\r\nthe very thought of which now maddens them, would be part of their\r\ndaily life. Socialism hangs above them as the crown hung in Bunyan’s\r\nstory above the man raking the muck heap--ready for them if they will\r\nbut lift their eyes. And even to the few who seem to escape and even\r\nprofit by the misery of our century, Socialism offers a new and nobler\r\nlife, when full sympathy with those about them, springing from full\r\nknowledge of their condition, shall be a source of happiness, and not,\r\nas now, of constant sorrow--when it shall no longer seem either folly\r\nor hypocrisy for a man to work openly for his highest ideal. To them\r\nbelongs the privilege that for each one of them the revolution may\r\nbegin as soon as he is ready to pay the price. They can live as simply\r\nas the equal rights of their fellows require: they can justify their\r\nlives by work in the noblest of all causes. For their reward, if they\r\ndesire any, they, like the rest, must wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[70] Lectures on Jurisprudence. Lecture XLVIII.\r\n\r\n[71] Happily, the ordinary anxieties as to the fate of children left\r\nwithout property, especially weaklings or women unlikely to attract\r\nhusbands, may be left out of account in speculations concerning\r\nsocialised communities.\r\n\r\n[72] “Principles of Political Economy,” p. 435.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY UNDER SOCIALISM.\r\n\r\nBY ANNIE BESANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which a scheme for a future organisation of\r\nindustry may be constructed. Of these, by far the easier and less\r\nuseful is the sketching of Utopia, an intellectual gymnastic in which\r\na power of coherent and vivid imagination is the one desideratum. The\r\nUtopist needs no knowledge of facts; indeed such a knowledge is a\r\nhindrance: for him the laws of social evolution do not exist. He is a\r\nlaw unto himself; and his men and women are not the wayward, spasmodic,\r\nirregular organisms of daily life, but automata, obeying the strings\r\nhe pulls. In a word, he creates, he does not construct: he makes alike\r\nhis materials and the laws within which they work, adapting them all\r\nto an ideal end. In describing a new Jerusalem, the only limits to its\r\nperfection are the limits of the writer’s imagination.\r\n\r\nThe second way is less attractive, less easy, but more useful. Starting\r\nfrom the present state of society, it seeks to discover the tendencies\r\nunderlying it; to trace those tendencies to their natural outworking\r\nin institutions; and so to forecast, not the far-off future, but the\r\nnext social stage. It fixes its gaze on the vast changes wrought by\r\nevolution, not the petty variations made by catastrophes; on the\r\nRevolutions which transform society, not the transient riots which\r\nmerely upset thrones and behead kings. This second way I elect to\r\nfollow; and this paper on industry under Socialism therefore starts\r\nfrom William Clarke’s exposition of the industrial evolution which\r\nhas been in progress during the last hundred and fifty years. In thus\r\nbuilding forward--in thus forecasting the transitions through which\r\nsociety will probably pass, I shall scarcely touch on the ideal Social\r\nState that will one day exist; and my sketch must lay itself open to\r\nall the criticisms which may be levelled against a society not ideally\r\nperfect. It is therefore necessary to bear in mind that I am only\r\ntrying to work out changes practicable among men and women as we know\r\nthem; always seeking to lay down, not what is ideally best, but what is\r\npossible; always choosing among the possible changes that which is on\r\nthe line towards the ideal, and will render further approach easier. In\r\nfact this paper is an attempt to answer the “How?” so often heard when\r\nSocialism is discussed. Large numbers of people accept, wholly or in\r\npart, the Socialist theory: they are intellectually convinced of its\r\nsoundness or emotionally attracted by its beauty; but they hesitate to\r\njoin in its propaganda, because they “don’t see where you are going to\r\nbegin,” or “don’t see where you are going to stop.” Both difficulties\r\nare disposed of by the fact that we are not “going to begin.” There\r\nwill never be a point at which a society crosses from Individualism to\r\nSocialism. The change is ever going forward; and our society is well on\r\nthe way to Socialism. All we can do is to consciously co-operate with\r\nthe forces at work, and thus render the transition more rapid than it\r\nwould otherwise be.\r\n\r\nThe third Fabian essay shews us the success of capitalism bringing\r\nabout a position which is at once intolerable to majority, and easy of\r\ncapture by them. At this point the destruction of the small industries\r\nhas broken down most of the gradations which used to exist between the\r\nlarge employer and the hired laborer, and has left in their place a\r\ngulf across which a few capitalists and a huge and hungry proletariat\r\nface each other. The denial of human sympathy by the employer in his\r\nbusiness relations with his “hands” has taught the “hands” to regard\r\nthe employer as outside the pale of their sympathy. The “respect of the\r\npublic conscience for the rights of property,” which was at bottom the\r\nprivate interest of each in his own little property, has diminished\r\nsince the many lost their individual possessions, and saw property\r\naccumulate in the hands of the few: it is now little more than a\r\ntradition inherited from a former social state. The “public conscience”\r\nwill soon condone, nay, it will first approve, and then demand,\r\nthe expropriation of capital which is used antisocially instead of\r\nsocially, and which belongs to that impersonal abstraction, a company,\r\ninstead of to our next door neighbor. To the average person it is one\r\nthing for the State to seize the little shop of James Smith who married\r\nour sister, or the thriving business of our Sam who works early and\r\nlate for his living; and quite another when James and Sam, ruined by\r\na big Company made up of shareholders of whom nobody knows anything\r\nbut that they pay low wages and take high dividends, have been obliged\r\nto become hired servants of the Company, instead of owning their own\r\nshops and machinery. Whose interest will it be to protest against the\r\nState taking over the capital, and transforming James and Sam from\r\nwage-slaves at the mercy of a foreman, into shareholders and public\r\nfunctionaries, with a voice in the management of the business in which\r\nthey are employed?\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, then, that the evolution of the capitalist system has\r\nproceeded but a little further along the present lines, concentrating\r\nthe control of industry, and increasingly substituting labor-saving\r\nmachinery for human beings. It is being accompanied, and must continue\r\nto be accompanied, by a growth of the numbers of the unemployed. These\r\nnumbers may ebb and flow, as some of the waves of a rising tide run\r\nforward some feet and then a few touch a lower level; but as the tide\r\nrises despite the fluctuations of the ripples, so the numbers of the\r\nunemployed will increase despite transient mountings and fallings. With\r\nthese, probably, will begin the tentative organisation of industry by\r\nthe State; but this organisation will soon be followed by the taking\r\nover by the community of some of the great Trusts.\r\n\r\nThe division of the country into clearly defined areas, each with\r\nits elected authority, is essential to any effective scheme of\r\norganisation. It is one of the symptoms of the coming change, that,\r\nin perfect unconsciousness of the nature of his act, Mr. Ritchie has\r\nestablished the Commune. He has divided England into districts ruled\r\nby County Councils, and has thus created the machinery without which\r\nSocialism was impracticable. True, he has only made an outline which\r\nneeds to be filled in; but Socialists can fill in, whereas they had\r\nno power to outline. It remains to give every adult a vote in the\r\nelection of Councillors; to shorten their term of office to a year; to\r\npay the Councillors, so that the public may have a right to the whole\r\nof their working time; to give the Councils power to take and hold\r\nland--a reform already asked for by the Liberal and Radical Union, a\r\nbody not consciously Socialist; and to remove all legal restrictions,\r\nso as to leave them as free to act corporately as an individual is to\r\nact individually. These measures accomplished, the rapidity with which\r\nour institutions are socialised, depends on the growth of Socialism\r\namong the people. It is essential to the stability of the changed\r\nforms of industry that they shall be made by the people, not imposed\r\nupon them; hence the value of Mr. Ritchie’s gift of Local Government,\r\nenabling each locality to move swiftly or slowly, to experiment on a\r\ncomparatively small scale, even to blunder without widespread disaster.\r\nThe _mot d’ordre_ for Socialists now is “Convert the electors; and\r\ncapture the County Councils.” These Councils, administering local\r\naffairs, with the national Executive, administering national affairs,\r\nare all destined to be turned into effective industrial organisers; and\r\nthe unit of administration must depend on the nature of the industry.\r\nThe post, the telegraph, the railways, the canals, and the great\r\nindustries capable of being organised into Trusts, will, so far as we\r\ncan see now, be best administered each from a single centre for the\r\nwhole kingdom. Tramways, gasworks, water-works, and many of the smaller\r\nproductive industries, will be best managed locally. In marking the\r\nlines of division, convenience and experience must be our guides. The\r\ndemarcations are of expediency, not of principle.\r\n\r\nThe first great problem that will press on the County Council for\r\nsolution will be that of the unemployed. Wisely or unwisely, it will\r\nhave to deal with them: wisely, if it organises them for productive\r\nindustry; unwisely, if it opens “relief works,” and tries, like an\r\nenlarged Bumble, to shirk the difficulty by enforcing barren and\r\noppressive toil upon outlawed wretches at the expense of the rest\r\nof the community. Many of the unemployed are unskilled laborers: a\r\nminority are skilled. They must first be registered as skilled and\r\nunskilled, and the former enrolled under their several trades. Then\r\ncan begin the rural organisation of labor on county farms, held by the\r\nCounty Councils. The Council will have its agricultural committee,\r\ncharged with the administrative details; and this committee will choose\r\nwell-trained, practical agriculturists, as directors of the farm\r\nbusiness. To the County Farm will be drafted from the unemployed in the\r\ntowns, the agricultural laborers who have wandered townwards in search\r\nof work, and many of the unskilled laborers. On these farms every\r\nadvantage of machinery, and every discovery in agricultural science,\r\nshould be utilised to the utmost. The crops should be carefully chosen\r\nwith reference to soil and aspect--cereals, fruit, vegetables--and the\r\nculture adapted to the crop, the one aim being to obtain the largest\r\namount of produce with the least expenditure of human labor. Whether\r\nland is most profitably cultivated in large or small parcels depends on\r\nthe crop; and in the great area of the County Farm, _la grande et la\r\npetite culture_ might each have its place. Economy would also gain by\r\nthe large number of laborers under the direction of the head farmer,\r\nsince they could be concentrated when required at any given spot, as\r\nin harvest time, and dispersed to work at the more continuous kinds of\r\ntillage when the seasonal task was over.\r\n\r\nTo these farms must also be sent some skilled laborers from among the\r\nunemployed, shoemakers, tailors, smiths, carpenters, etc.; so that the\r\nCounty Farm may be self-supporting as far as it can be without waste\r\nof productive power. All the small industries necessary in daily life\r\nshould be carried on in it, and an industrial commune thus built up.\r\nThe democracy might be trusted to ordain that an eight hours’ day, and\r\na comfortable home, should be part of the life-conditions on the County\r\nFarm. Probably each large farm would soon have its central store,\r\nwith its adjacent railway station, in addition to the ordinary farm\r\nbuildings; its public hall in the centre of the farm village to be used\r\nfor lectures, concerts, and entertainments of all sorts; its public\r\nschools, elementary and technical; and soon, possibly from the outset,\r\nits public meal-room, saving time and trouble to housewives, and, while\r\neconomising fuel and food, giving a far greater choice and variety of\r\ndishes. Large dwellings, with suites of rooms, might perhaps replace\r\nold-fashioned cottages; for it is worth noting, as showing the tendency\r\nalready existing among ourselves to turn from isolated self-dependence\r\nto the advantages of associated living, that many modern flats are\r\nbeing built without servants’ rooms, the house-cleaning, etc., being\r\ndone by persons engaged for the whole block, and the important meals\r\nbeing taken at restaurants, so as to avoid the trouble and expense of\r\nprivate cooking. It will surely be well in initiating new organisations\r\nof industry to start on the most advanced lines, and take advantage of\r\nevery modern tendency towards less isolated modes of living. Socialists\r\nmust work hard to make municipal dealings with the unemployed avenues\r\nto the higher life, not grudging utilisation of pauper labor. And as\r\nthey know their aim, and the other political parties live but from\r\nhand to mouth, they ought to be able to exercise a steady and uniform\r\npressure, which, just because it is steady and uniform, will impress\r\nits direction on the general movement.\r\n\r\nThe note of urban industrial organisation, as of all other, must be\r\nthat each person shall be employed to do what he can do best, not\r\nwhat he does worst. It may be desirable for a man to have two trades;\r\nbut watch-making and stone-breaking are not convenient alternative\r\noccupations. Where the skilled unemployed belong to trades carried on\r\neverywhere, such as baking, shoemaking, tailoring, etc., they should be\r\nemployed at their own trades in municipal workshops, and their products\r\ngarnered in municipal stores. These workshops will be under the\r\ndirection of foremen, thoroughly skilled workmen, able to superintend\r\nand direct as though in private employment. The working-day must be of\r\neight hours, and the wages, for the present, the Trades Union minimum.\r\nThen, instead of tailors and shoemakers tramping the streets ragged\r\nand barefoot, the tailors will be making clothes and the shoemakers\r\nboots and shoes; and the shoemaker with the wages he earns will buy\r\nthe tailor’s products, and the tailor the shoemaker’s. Then, instead\r\nof supporting the unemployed by rates levied on the employed they will\r\nbe set to work to supply their own necessities, and be producers of\r\nthe wealth they consume instead of consuming, in enforced idleness\r\nor barren penal exercises in the stoneyard, the wealth produced by\r\nothers. Masons, bricklayers, plumbers, carpenters, etc., might be set\r\nto work in building decent and pleasant dwellings--in the style of\r\nthe blocks of flats, not of the barracks called model dwellings--for\r\nthe housing of the municipal industrial army. I lay stress on the\r\npleasantness of the dwellings. These places are to be dwellings for\r\ncitizens, not prisons for paupers; and there is no possible reason why\r\nthey should not be made attractive. Under Socialism the workers are to\r\nbe the nation, and all that is best is for their service; for, be it\r\nremembered, our faces are set towards Socialism, and our organisation\r\nof labor is to be on Socialist lines.\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that among the unemployed some will be found whose\r\ntrade can only be carried on by large numbers, and is not one of the\r\nindustries of the town into which their unlucky fate has drifted them.\r\nThese should be sent into municipal service in the towns where their\r\ntrade is the staple industry, there to be employed in the municipal\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with this rural and urban organisation of non-centralised\r\nindustries will proceed the taking over of the great centralised\r\nindustries, centralised for us by capitalists, who thus unconsciously\r\npave the way for their own supersession. Everything which has been\r\norganised into a Trust, and has been worked for a time in the Trust\r\nfashion, is ripe for appropriation by the community. All minerals\r\nwould be most properly worked in this centralised way; and it will\r\nprobably be found most convenient to work all the big productive\r\nindustries--such as the textile--in similar fashion. It is idle to\r\nsay that it cannot be done by the State when it is being done by a\r\nring of capitalists: a Local Board, an Iron Board, a Tin Board, can\r\nbe as easily held responsible to the nation as to a casual crowd of\r\nshareholders. There need be no dislocation of production in making the\r\ntransference: the active organisers and directors of a Trust do not\r\nnecessarily, or even usually, own the capital invested in it. If the\r\nState finds it convenient to hire these organisers and directors, there\r\nis nothing to prevent its doing so for as long or as short a period\r\nas it chooses. The temporary arrangements made with them during the\r\ntransition period must be governed by expediency.\r\n\r\nLet us pause for a moment to estimate the position so far. The\r\nunemployed have been transformed into communal workers--in the country\r\non great farms, improvements of the Bonanza farms in America--in the\r\ntowns in various trades. Public stores for agricultural and industrial\r\nproducts are open in all convenient places, and filled with the goods\r\nthus communally produced. The great industries, worked as Trusts,\r\nare controlled by the State instead of by capitalist rings. The\r\nprivate capitalist, however, will still be in business, producing\r\nand distributing on his own account in competition with the communal\r\norganisations, which at present will have occupied only part of the\r\nindustrial field. But apart from a pressure which will be recognised\r\nwhen we come to deal with the remuneration of labor, these private\r\nenterprises will be carried on under circumstances of ever-increasing\r\ndifficulty. In face of the orderly communal arrays, playing into\r\neach other’s hands, with the credit of the country behind them, the\r\nventures of the private capitalist will be at as great a disadvantage\r\nas the cottage industries of the last century in face of the factory\r\nindustries of our own period. The Trusts have taught us how to drive\r\ncompeting capitals out of the market by associated capitals. The\r\nCentral Boards or County Councils will be able to utilise this power\r\nof association further than any private capitalists. Thus the economic\r\nforces which replaced the workshop by the factory, will replace the\r\nprivate shop by the municipal store and the private factory by the\r\nmunicipal one. And the advantages of greater concentration of capital\r\nand of the association of labor will not be the only ones enjoyed by\r\nthe communal workers. All waste will be checked, every labor-saving\r\nappliance utilised to the utmost, where the object is the production\r\nof general wealth and not the production of profit to be appropriated\r\nby a class; for in the one case it is the interest of the producers to\r\nproduce--inasmuch as their enjoyment depends on the productivity of\r\ntheir labor--whereas in the other it is their interest to sterilise\r\ntheir labor as far as they dare in order to render more of it necessary\r\nand so keep up its price. As the organisation of the public industry\r\nextends, and supplants more and more the individualist producer, the\r\nprobable demand will be more easily estimated, and the supply regulated\r\nto meet it. The Municipalities and Central Boards will take the place\r\nof the competing small capitalists and the rings of large ones; and\r\nproduction will become ordered and rational instead of anarchical and\r\nreckless as it is to-day. After awhile the private producers will\r\ndisappear, not because there will be any law against individualist\r\nproduction, but because it will not pay. No one will care to face the\r\nworries, the harassments, the anxieties, of individual struggling for\r\nlivelihood, when ease, freedom, and security can be enjoyed in the\r\ncommunal services.\r\n\r\nThe best form of management during the transition period, and possibly\r\nfor a long time to come, will be through the Communal Councils,\r\nwhich will appoint committees to superintend the various branches\r\nof industry. These committees will engage the necessary manager and\r\nforeman for each shop, factory, etc., and will hold the power of\r\ndismissal as of appointment. I do not believe that the direct election\r\nof the manager and foreman by the employees would be found to work\r\nwell in practice, or to be consistent with the discipline necessary\r\nin carrying on any large business undertaking. It seems to me better\r\nthat the Commune should elect its Council--thus keeping under its own\r\ncontrol the general authority--but should empower the Council to select\r\nthe officials, so that the power of selection and dismissal within the\r\nvarious sub-divisions should lie with the nominees of the whole Commune\r\ninstead of with the particular group immediately concerned.\r\n\r\nThere is no practical difficulty in the way of the management of\r\nthe ordinary productive industries, large or small. The Trusts and\r\nCo-operation have, between them, solved, or put us in the way of\r\nsolving, all problems connected with these. But there are difficulties\r\nin connexion with the industries concerned in the production of such\r\ncommodities as books and newspapers. During the transitional stage\r\nthese difficulties will not arise; but when all industries are carried\r\non by the Commune, or the Nation, how will books and newspapers be\r\nproduced? I only throw out the following suggestions. Printing, like\r\nbaking, tailoring, shoemaking, is a communal rather than a national\r\nindustry. Suppose we had printing offices controlled by the Communal\r\nCouncil. The printing committee might be left free to accept any\r\npublication it thought valuable, as a private firm to-day may take the\r\nrisk of publication, the arrangement with the author being purchase\r\noutright, or royalty on copies sold, in each case so much to be put to\r\nhis credit at the Communal Bank. But there are many authors whose goods\r\nare desired by no one: it would be absurd to force the community to\r\npublish all minor poetry. Why not accept the principle that in every\r\ncase where the printing committee declines to print at the communal\r\nrisk, the author may have his work printed by transferring from his\r\ncredit at the Communal Bank to the account of the printing committee\r\nsufficient to cover the cost of printing? The committee should have\r\nno power to refuse to print, where the cost was covered. Thus liberty\r\nof expression would be guarded as a constitutional right, while the\r\ncommunity would not be charged with the cost of printing every stupid\r\neffusion that its fond composer might deem worthy of publicity.\r\n\r\nNewspapers might be issued on similar terms; and it would always be\r\nopen to individuals, or to groups of individuals, to publish anything\r\nthey pleased on covering the cost of publication. With the comparative\r\naffluence which would be enjoyed by each member of the community,\r\nanyone who really cared to reach the public ear would be able to do so\r\nby diminishing his expenditure in other directions.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty which will meet us although not immediately, is the\r\ncompetition for employment in certain pleasanter branches of industry.\r\nAt present an unemployed person would catch eagerly at the chance of\r\nany well-paid work he was able to perform. If he were able both to set\r\ntype and to stitch coats, he would not dream of grumbling if he were\r\nby chance offered the job he liked the less of the two: he would be\r\nonly too glad to get either. But it is quite possible that as the vast\r\namelioration of life-conditions proceeds, Jeshurun will wax fat and\r\nkick if, when he prefers to make microscopic lenses, he is desired to\r\nmake mirrors. Under these circumstances, Jeshurun will, I fear, have\r\nto accommodate himself to the demand. If the number of people engaged\r\nin making lenses suffices to meet the demand for lenses, Jeshurun must\r\nconsent to turn his talents for the time to mirror-making. After all,\r\nhis state will not be very pitiable, though Socialism will have failed,\r\nit is true, to make 2 + 2 = 5.\r\n\r\nThis, however, hardly solves the general question as to the\r\napportioning of laborers to the various forms of labor. But a solution\r\nhas been found by the ingenious author of “Looking Backward, from A.D.\r\n2000.” Leaving young men and women free to choose their employments, he\r\nwould equalise the rates of volunteering by equalising the attractions\r\nof the trades. In many cases natural bent, left free to develop itself\r\nduring a lengthened educational term, will determine the choice of\r\navocation. Human beings are fortunately very varied in their capacities\r\nand tastes; that which attracts one repels another. But there are\r\nunpleasant and indispensable forms of labor which, one would imagine,\r\ncan attract none--mining, sewer-cleaning, &c. These might be rendered\r\nattractive by making the hours of labor in them much shorter than the\r\nnormal working day of pleasanter occupations. Many a strong, vigorous\r\nman would greatly prefer a short spell of disagreeable work to a long\r\none at a desk. As it is well to leave the greatest possible freedom to\r\nthe individual, this equalising of advantages in all trades would be\r\nfar better than any attempt to perform the impossible task of choosing\r\nan employment for each. A person would be sure to hate any work into\r\nwhich he was directly forced, even though it were the very one he would\r\nhave chosen had he been left to himself.\r\n\r\nFurther, much of the most disagreeable and laborious work might be\r\ndone by machinery, as it would be now if it were not cheaper to exploit\r\na helot class. When it became illegal to send small boys up chimneys,\r\nchimneys did not cease to be swept: a machine was invented for sweeping\r\nthem. Coal-cutting might now be done by machinery, instead of by a man\r\nlying on his back, picking away over his head at the imminent risk of\r\nhis own life; but the machine is much dearer than men, so the miners\r\ncontinue to have their chests crushed in by the falling coal. Under\r\nSocialism men’s lives and limbs will be more valuable than machinery;\r\nand science will be tasked to substitute the one for the other.\r\n\r\nIn truth the extension of machinery is very likely to solve many of\r\nthe problems connected with differential advantages in employment;\r\nand it seems certain that, in the very near future, the skilled\r\nworker will not be the man who is able to perform a particular set of\r\noperations, but the man who has been trained in the use of machinery.\r\nThe difference of trade will be in the machine rather than in the man:\r\nwhether the produce is nails or screws, boots or coats, cloth or silk,\r\npaper-folding or type-setting, will depend on the internal arrangements\r\nof the mechanism and not on the method of applying the force. What we\r\nshall probably do will be to instruct all our youth in the principles\r\nof mechanics and in the handling of machines; the machines will be\r\nconstructed so as to turn the force into the various channels required\r\nto produce the various articles; and the skilled workman will be the\r\nskilled _mechanic_, not the skilled printer or bootmaker. At the\r\npresent time a few hours’ or a few days’ study will make the trained\r\nmechanician master of any machine you can place before him. The line\r\nof progress is to substitute machines for men in every department of\r\nproduction: let the brain plan, guide, control; but let iron and steel,\r\nsteam and electricity, that do not tire and cannot be brutalised, do\r\nthe whole of the heavy toil that exhausts human frames to-day. There\r\nis not the slightest reason to suppose that we are at the end of an\r\ninventive era. Rather are we only just beginning to grope after the\r\nuses of electricity: and machinery has before it possibilities almost\r\nundreamed of now, the men produced by our system being too rough-handed\r\nfor the manipulation of delicate and complicated contrivances. I\r\nsuggest this only as a probable simplification of balancing the supply\r\nand demand in various forms of labor in the future: our immediate\r\nmethod of regulation must be the equalising of advantages in them.\r\n\r\nOne may guess that in each nation all the Boards and communal\r\nauthorities will ultimately be represented in some central Executive,\r\nor Industrial Ministry; that the Minister of Agriculture, of Mineral\r\nIndustries, of Textile Industries, and so on, will have relations with\r\nsimilar officers in other lands; and that thus, internationally as well\r\nas nationally, co-operation will replace competition. But that end is\r\nnot yet.\r\n\r\nWe now approach a yet more thorny subject than the organisation of the\r\nworkers. What should be the remuneration of labor--what the share of\r\nthe product taken respectively by the individual, the municipality, and\r\nthe State?\r\n\r\nThe answer depends on the answer to a previous question. Is the\r\norganisation of the unemployed to be undertaken in order to transform\r\nthem into self-supporting, self-respecting citizens; or is it to be\r\ncarried on as a form of exploitation, utilising pauper labor for the\r\nproduction of profit for non-paupers? The whole matter turns on this\r\npoint; and unless we know our own minds, and fight for the right method\r\nand against the wrong from the very beginning, the organisation of the\r\nunemployed will be a buttress for the present system instead of a step\r\ntowards a better. Already there is talk of establishing labor colonies\r\nin connexion with workhouses; and there is no time to be lost if we are\r\nto take advantage of the good in the proposal and exclude the bad. The\r\nCounty Councils also will lead to an increase of municipal employment;\r\nand the method of that employment is vital.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary vestryman, driven by the force of circumstances into\r\norganising the unemployed, will try to extract a profit to the\r\nratepayers from pauper farms by paying the lowest rates of wages. He\r\nwould find this way of proceeding very congenial, and would soon,\r\nif permitted, simply municipalise slave-driving. In this way the\r\nmunicipal and rural organisation of labor, even when its necessity and\r\nits advantages are realised, can do nothing but change the form of\r\nexploitation of labor if the workers in public employ are to be paid a\r\nwage fixed by the competition of the market, and the profits of their\r\nlabor used only for the relief of the rates. Under such circumstances\r\nwe should have the whole of the rates paid by the communal workers,\r\nwhile the private employers would go free. This would not be a\r\ntransition to Socialism, but only a new way of creating a class of\r\nmunicipal serfs, which would make our towns burlesques of the ancient\r\nGreek slaveholding “democracies.” We shall find surer ground by\r\nrecalling and applying the principle of Socialism that the laborers\r\nshall enjoy the full product of their toil. It seems to me that this\r\nmight be worked out somewhat in the following way:\r\n\r\nOut of the value of the communal produce must come rent of land\r\npayable to the local authority, rent of plant needed for working\r\nthe industries, wages advanced and fixed in the usual way, taxes,\r\nreserve fund, accumulation fund, and the other charges necessary for\r\nthe carrying on of the communal business. All these deducted, the\r\nremaining value should be divided among the communal workers as a\r\n“bonus.” It would be obviously inconvenient, if not impossible, for\r\nthe district authority to sub-divide this value and allot so much to\r\neach of its separate undertakings--so much left over from gas works\r\nfor the men employed there, so much from the tramways for the men\r\nemployed on them, and so on. It would be far simpler and easier for the\r\nmunicipal employees to be regarded as a single body, in the service of\r\na single employer, the local authority; and that the surplus from the\r\nwhole of the businesses carried on by the Communal Council should be\r\ndivided without distinction among the whole of the communal employees.\r\nControversy will probably arise as to the division: shall all the\r\nshares be equal; or shall the workers receive in proportion to the\r\nsupposed dignity or indignity of their work? Inequality, however, would\r\nbe odious; and I have already suggested (p. 145) a means of adjusting\r\ndifferent kinds of labor to a system of equal division of net product.\r\nThis meets the difficulty of the varying degrees of irksomeness\r\nwithout invidiously setting up any kind of socially useful labor as\r\nmore honorable than any other--a distinction essentially unsocial\r\nand pernicious. But since in public affairs ethics are apt to go to\r\nthe wall, and appeals to social justice too often fall on deaf ears,\r\nit is lucky that in this case ethics and convenience coincide. The\r\nimpossibility of estimating the separate value of each man’s labor with\r\nany really valid result, the friction which would arise, the jealousies\r\nwhich would be provoked, the inevitable discontent, favoritism and\r\njobbery that would prevail: all these things will drive the Communal\r\nCouncil into the right path, equal remuneration of all workers. That\r\npath once entered on, the principle of simplification will spread; and\r\npresently it will probably be found convenient that all the Communal\r\nCouncils shall send in their reports to a Central Board, stating the\r\nnumber of their employees, the amount of the values produced, the\r\ndeductions for rent and other charges, and their available surplus.\r\nAll these surpluses added together would then be divided by the total\r\nnumber of communal employees, and the sum thus reached would be the\r\nshare of each worker. The national trusts would at first be worked\r\nseparately on lines analogous to those sketched for the Communes;\r\nbut later these would be lumped in with the rest, and still further\r\nequalise the reward of labor. As private enterprises dwindle, more\r\nand more of the workers will pass into communal employ, until at last\r\nthe Socialist ideal is touched of a nation in which all adults are\r\nworkers, and all share the national product. But be it noted that all\r\nthis grows out of the first organisation of industry by Municipalities\r\nand County Councils, and will evolve just as fast or just as slowly\r\nas the community and its sections choose. The values dealt with, and\r\nthe numbers employed at first, would not imply as much complexity of\r\ndetail as is involved in many of the great businesses now carried on by\r\nindividuals and by companies. The same brains will be available for the\r\nwork as are now hired by individuals; and it is rather the novelty of\r\nthe idea than the difficulty of its realisation which will stand in the\r\nway of its acceptance.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that for some time to come, the captains\r\nof industry will be more highly paid than the rank and file of the\r\nindustrial army, not because it is just that they should receive higher\r\nremuneration, but because they, having still the alternative of private\r\nenterprise, will be able to demand their ordinary terms, at which\r\nit will pay the community better to engage them than to do without\r\nthem--which would be indeed impossible. But their remuneration will\r\nfall as education spreads: their present value is a scarcity value,\r\nlargely dependent on their monopoly of the higher education; and as the\r\nwider training is thrown open to all, an ever-increasing number will\r\nbecome qualified to act as organisers and directors.\r\n\r\nThe form in which the worker’s share is paid to him is not a matter of\r\nprimary importance. It would probably be convenient to have Communal\r\nBanks, issuing cheques like those of the Cheque Bank; and these banks\r\ncould open credits to the workers to the amount of their remuneration.\r\nThe way in which each worker expended his wealth would of course be his\r\nown business.\r\n\r\nThe above method of dealing with the surplus remaining from communal\r\nlabor after rent and other charges had been paid to the Municipality,\r\nwould prove the most potent factor in the supersession of private\r\nenterprises. The amounts produced by the communal organisations would\r\nexceed those produced under individualist control; but even if this\r\nwere not so, yet the shares of the communal workers, as they would\r\ninclude the produce now consumed by idlers, would be higher than any\r\nwage which could be paid by the private employer. Hence competition to\r\nenter the communal service, and a constant pressure on the Communal\r\nCouncils to enlarge their undertakings.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that children and workers incapacitated by age or\r\nsickness should receive an equal share with the communal employees. As\r\nall have been children, are at times sick, and hope to live to old age,\r\nall in turn would share the advantage; and it is only just that those\r\nwho have labored honestly in health and through maturity should enjoy\r\nthe reward of labor in sickness and through old age.\r\n\r\nThe shares of individuals and of Municipalities being thus apportioned,\r\nthere remains only a word to say as to the Central National\r\nCouncil--the “State” _par excellence_. This would derive the revenues\r\nnecessary for the discharge of its functions, from contributions\r\nlevied on the Communal Councils. It is evident that in the adjustment\r\nof these contributions could be effected the “nationalisation” of any\r\nspecial natural resources, such as mines, harbors, &c., enjoyed by\r\nexceptionally well situated Communes. The levy would be, in fact, of\r\nthe nature of an income tax.\r\n\r\nSuch a plan of Distribution--especially that part of it which equalises\r\nthe shares in the product--is likely to provoke the question: “What\r\nwill be the stimulus to labor under the proposed system? Will not\r\nthe idle evade their fair share of labor, and live in clover on the\r\nindustry of their neighbors?”\r\n\r\nThe general stimulus to labor will be, in the first place, then\r\nas now, the starvation which would follow the cessation of labor.\r\nUntil we discover the country in which jam-rolls grow on bushes, and\r\nroasted sucking-pigs run about crying “Come eat me!” we are under an\r\nimperious necessity to produce. We shall work because, on the whole,\r\nwe prefer work to starvation. In the transition to Socialism, when the\r\norganisation of labor by the Communal Councils begins, the performance\r\nof work will be the condition of employment; and as non-employment will\r\nmean starvation--for when work is offered, no relief of any kind need\r\nbe given to the healthy adult who refuses to perform it--the strongest\r\npossible stimulus will force men to work. In fact, “work or starve”\r\nwill be the alternative set before each communal employee; and as men\r\nnow prefer long-continued and ill-paid work to starvation, they will\r\ncertainly, unless human nature be entirely changed, prefer short and\r\nwell-paid work to starvation. The individual shirker will be dealt with\r\nmuch as he is to-day: he will be warned, and, if he prove incorrigibly\r\nidle, discharged from the communal employ. The vast majority of men\r\nnow seek to retain their employment by a reasonable discharge of their\r\nduty: why should they not do the same when the employment is on easier\r\nconditions? At first, discharge would mean being flung back into the\r\nwhirlpool of competition, a fate not lightly to be challenged. Later,\r\nas the private enterprises succumbed to the competition of the Commune,\r\nit would mean almost hopelessness of obtaining a livelihood. When\r\nsocial reorganisation is complete, it would mean absolute starvation.\r\nAnd as the starvation would be deliberately incurred and voluntarily\r\nundergone, it would meet with no sympathy and no relief.\r\n\r\nThe next stimulus would be the appetite of the worker for the result\r\nof the communal toil, and the determination of his fellow-workers to\r\nmake him take his fair share of the work of producing it. It is found\r\nat the present time that a very small share of the profits arising\r\nfrom associated labor acts as a tremendous stimulus to each individual\r\nproducer. Firms which allot a part of their profits for division among\r\ntheir employees, find the plan profitable to themselves. The men work\r\neagerly to increase the common product, knowing that each will have a\r\nlarger bonus as the common product is larger: they become vigilant as\r\nto waste in production; they take care of the machinery; they save gas,\r\netc. In a word, they lessen the cost as much as they can, because each\r\nsaving means gain to them. We see from the experiments of Leclaire and\r\nGodin that inventiveness also is stimulated by a share in the common\r\nproduce. The workers in these businesses are ever trying to discover\r\nbetter methods to improve their machinery, in a word to progress,\r\nsince each step forward brings improvement of their lot. Inventions\r\ncome from a desire to save trouble, as well as from the impulse of\r\ninventive genius, the joy in accomplishing an intellectual triumph,\r\nand the delight of serving the race. Small inventions are continually\r\nbeing made by clever workmen to facilitate their operations, even\r\nwhen they are not themselves personally gainers by them; and there\r\nis no reason to fear that this spontaneous exercise of inventiveness\r\nwill cease when the added productivity of labor lightens the task or\r\nincreases the harvest of the laborer. Is it to be argued that men will\r\nbe industrious, careful, and inventive when they get only a fraction\r\nof the result of their associated labor, but will plunge into sloth,\r\nrecklessness and stagnation when they get the whole? that a little gain\r\nstimulates, but any gain short of complete satisfaction would paralyse?\r\nIf there is one vice more certain than another to be unpopular in a\r\nSocialistic community, it is laziness. The man who shirked would find\r\nhis mates making his position intolerable, even before he suffered the\r\ndoom of expulsion.\r\n\r\nBut while these compelling motives will be potent in their action\r\non man as he now is, there are others, already acting on some men,\r\nwhich will one day act on all men. Human beings are not the simple\r\nand onesided organisms they appear to the superficial glance of the\r\nIndividualist--moved only by a single motive, the desire for pecuniary\r\ngain--by one longing, the longing for wealth. Under our present social\r\nsystem, the struggle for riches assumes an abnormal and artificial\r\ndevelopment: riches mean nearly all that makes life worth having,\r\nsecurity against starvation, gratification of taste, enjoyment of\r\npleasant and cultured society, superiority to many temptations,\r\nself-respect, consideration, comfort, knowledge, freedom, as far as\r\nthese things are attainable under existing conditions. In a society\r\nwhere poverty means social discredit, where misfortune is treated as a\r\ncrime, where the prison of the workhouse is a guerdon of failure, and\r\nthe bitter carking harassment of daily wants unmet by daily supply is\r\never hanging over the head of each worker, what wonder that money seems\r\nthe one thing needful, and that every other thought is lost in the\r\nfrensied rush to escape all that is summed up in the one word Poverty?\r\n\r\nBut this abnormal development of the gold-hunger would disappear upon\r\nthe certainty for each of the means of subsistence. Let each individual\r\nfeel absolutely secure of subsistence, let every anxiety as to the\r\nmaterial wants of his future be swept away; and the longing for wealth\r\nwill lose its leverage. The daily bread being certain, the tyranny of\r\npecuniary gain will be broken; and life will begin to be used in living\r\nand not in struggling for the chance to live. Then will come to the\r\nfront all those multifarious motives which are at work in the complex\r\nhuman organism even now, and which will assume their proper importance\r\nwhen the basis of physical life is assured. The desire to excel, the\r\njoy in creative work, the longing to improve, the eagerness to win\r\nsocial approval, the instinct of benevolence; all these will start\r\ninto full life, and will serve at once as the stimulus to labor and\r\nthe reward of excellence. It is instructive to notice that these very\r\nforces may already be seen at work in every case in which subsistence\r\nis secured, and they alone supply the stimulus to action. The soldier’s\r\nsubsistence is certain, and does not depend on his exertions. At once\r\nhe becomes susceptible to appeals to his patriotism, to his _esprit\r\nde corps_, to the honor of his flag; he will dare anything for glory,\r\nand value a bit of bronze, which is the “reward of valor,” far more\r\nthan a hundred times its weight in gold. Yet many of the private\r\nsoldiers come from the worst of the population; and military glory\r\nand success in murder are but poor objects to aim at. If so much can\r\nbe done under circumstances so unpromising, what may we not hope from\r\nnobler aspirations? Or take the eagerness, self-denial, and strenuous\r\neffort, thrown by young men into their mere games! The desire to be\r\ncaptain of the Oxford eleven, stroke of the Cambridge boat, victor\r\nin the foot-race or the leaping, in a word, the desire to excel, is\r\nstrong enough to impel to exertions which often ruin physical health.\r\nEverywhere we see the multiform desires of humanity assert themselves\r\nwhen once livelihood is secure. It is on the devotion of these to the\r\nservice of Society, as the development of the social instincts teaches\r\nmen to identify their interests with those of the community, that\r\nSocialism must ultimately rely for progress; but in saying this we are\r\nonly saying that Socialism relies for progress on human nature as a\r\nwhole, instead of on that mere fragment of it known as the desire for\r\ngain. If human nature should break down, then Socialism will break\r\ndown; but at least we have a hundred strings to our Socialist bow,\r\nwhile the Individualist has only one.\r\n\r\nBut Humanity will not break down. The faith which is built on it is\r\nfaith founded on a rock. Under healthier and happier conditions,\r\nHumanity will rise to heights undreamed of now; and the most exquisite\r\nUtopias, as sung by the poet and idealist, shall, to our children, seem\r\nbut dim and broken lights compared with their perfect day. All that we\r\nneed are courage, prudence, and faith. Faith, above all, which dares to\r\nbelieve that justice and love are not impossible; and that more than\r\nthe best that man can dream of shall one day be realised by men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSITION TO SOCIAL DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSITION.[73]\r\n\r\nBY G. BERNARD SHAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the British Association honored me by an invitation to take part\r\nin its proceedings, I proposed to do so by reading a paper entitled\r\n“_Finishing_ the Transition to Social Democracy.” The word “finishing”\r\nhas been, on consideration, dropped. In modern use it has gathered\r\na certain sudden and sinister sense which I desire carefully to\r\ndissociate from the process to be described. I suggested it in the\r\nfirst instance only to convey in the shortest way that we are in the\r\nmiddle of the transition instead of shrinking from the beginning of\r\nit; and that I propose to deal with the part of it that lies before us\r\nrather than that which we have already accomplished. Therefore, though\r\nI shall begin at the beginning, I shall make no apology for traversing\r\ncenturies by leaps and bounds at the risk of sacrificing the dignity of\r\nhistory to the necessity for coming to the point as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, let us commence by glancing at the Middle Ages. There\r\nyou find, theoretically, a much more orderly England than the England\r\nof to-day. Agriculture is organised on an intelligible and consistent\r\nsystem in the feudal manor or commune; handicraft is ordered by the\r\nguilds of the towns. Every man has his class, and every class its\r\nduties. Payments and privileges are fixed by law and custom, sanctioned\r\nby the moral sense of the community, and revised by the light of that\r\nmoral sense whenever the operation of supply and demand disturbs\r\ntheir adjustment. Liberty and Equality are unheard of; but so is Free\r\nCompetition. The law does not suffer a laborer’s wife to wear a silver\r\ngirdle; neither does it force her to work sixteen hours a day for\r\nthe value of a modern shilling. Nobody entertains the idea that the\r\nindividual has any right to trade as he pleases without reference to\r\nthe rest. When the townsfolk, for instance, form a market, they quite\r\nunderstand that they have not taken that trouble in order to enable\r\nspeculators to make money. If they catch a man buying goods solely in\r\norder to sell them a few hours later at a higher price, they treat that\r\nman as a rascal; and he never, as far as I have been able to ascertain,\r\nventures to plead that it is socially beneficent, and indeed a pious\r\nduty, to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest. If he did,\r\nthey would probably burn him alive, not altogether inexcusably. As to\r\nProtection, it comes naturally to them.\r\n\r\nThis Social Order, relics of which are still to be found in all\r\ndirections, did not collapse because it was unjust or absurd. It\r\nwas burst by the growth of the social organism. Its machinery was\r\ntoo primitive, and its administration too naïve, too personal,\r\ntoo meddlesome to cope with anything more complex than a group of\r\nindustrially independent communes, centralised very loosely, if at\r\nall, for purely political purposes. Industrial relation with other\r\ncountries were beyond its comprehension. Its grasp of the obligations\r\nof interparochial morality was none of the surest: of international\r\nmorality it had no notion. A Frenchman or a Scotchman was a natural\r\nenemy: a Muscovite was a foreign devil: the relationship of a negro\r\nto the human race was far more distant than that of a gorilla is\r\nnow admitted to be. Thus, when the discovery of the New World began\r\nthat economic revolution which changed every manufacturing town into\r\na mere booth in the world’s fair, and quite altered the immediate\r\nobjects and views of producers, English adventurers took to the sea\r\nin a frame of mind peculiarly favorable to commercial success. They\r\nwere unaffectedly pious, and had the force of character which is only\r\npossible to men who are founded on convictions. At the same time, they\r\nregarded piracy as a brave and patriotic pursuit, and the slave trade\r\nas a perfectly honest branch of commerce, adventurous enough to be\r\nconsistent with the honor of a gentleman, and lucrative enough to make\r\nit well worth the risk. When they stole the cargo of a foreign ship, or\r\nmade a heavy profit on a batch of slaves, they regarded their success\r\nas a direct proof of divine protection. The owners of accumulated\r\nwealth hastened to “venture” their capital with these men. Persons of\r\nall the richer degrees, from Queen Elizabeth downward, took shares\r\nin the voyages of the merchant adventurers. The returns justified\r\ntheir boldness; and the foundation of the industrial greatness and\r\nthe industrial shame of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was\r\nlaid; modern Capitalism thus arising in enterprises for which men are\r\nnow, by civilised nations, hung or shot as human vermin. And it is\r\ncurious to see still, in the commercial adventurers of our own time,\r\nthe same incongruous combination of piety and rectitude with the most\r\nunscrupulous and revolting villainy. We all know the merchant princes\r\nwhose enterprise, whose steady perseverance, whose high personal honor,\r\nblameless family relations, large charities, and liberal endowment\r\nof public institutions mark them out as very pillars of society; and\r\nwho are nevertheless grinding their wealth out of the labor of women\r\nand children with such murderous rapacity that they have to hand over\r\nthe poorest of their victims to sweaters whose sole special function\r\nis the evasion of the Factory Acts. They have, in fact, no more sense\r\nof social solidarity with the wage-workers than Drake had with the\r\nSpaniards or negroes.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of foreign trade and Capitalism, industry so far outgrew\r\nthe control, not merely of the individual, but of the village, the\r\nguild, the municipality, and even the central government, that it\r\nseemed as if all attempt at regulation must be abandoned. Every law\r\nmade for the better ordering of business either did not work at all, or\r\nworked only as a monopoly enforced by exasperating official meddling,\r\ndirectly injuring the general interest, and reacting disastrously on\r\nthe particular interest it was intended to protect. The laws, too,\r\nhad ceased to be even honestly intended, owing to the seizure of\r\npolitical power by the capitalist classes, which had been prodigiously\r\nenriched by the operation of economic laws which were not then\r\nunderstood.[74] Matters reached a position in which legislation and\r\nregulation were so mischievous and corrupt, that anarchy became the\r\nideal of all progressive thinkers and practical men. The intellectual\r\nrevolt formally inaugurated by the Reformation was reinforced in the\r\neighteenth century by the great industrial revolution which began with\r\nthe utilisation of steam and the invention of the spinning jenny.[75]\r\nThen came chaos. The feudal system became an absurdity when its basis\r\nof communism with inequality of condition had changed into private\r\nproperty with free contract and competition rents. The guild system had\r\nno machinery for dealing with division of labor, the factory system, or\r\ninternational trade: it recognized in competitive individualism only\r\nsomething to be repressed as diabolical. But competitive individualism\r\nsimply took possession of the guilds, and turned them into refectories\r\nfor aldermen, and notable additions to the grievances and laughing\r\nstocks of posterity.\r\n\r\nThe desperate effort of the human intellect to unravel this tangle of\r\nindustrial anarchy brought modern political economy into existence.\r\nIt took shape in France, where the confusion was thrice confounded;\r\nand proved itself a more practical department of philosophy than the\r\nmetaphysics of the schoolmen, the Utopian socialism of More, or the\r\nsociology of Hobbes. It could trace its ancestry to Aristotle; but\r\njust then the human intellect was rather tired of Aristotle, whose\r\neconomics, besides, were those of slave holding republics. Political\r\neconomy soon declared for industrial anarchy; for private property; for\r\nindividual recklessness of everything except individual accumulation\r\nof riches; and for the abolition of all the functions of the State\r\nexcept those of putting down violent conduct and invasions of private\r\nproperty. It might have echoed Jack Cade’s exclamation, “But then are\r\nwe in order, when we are most out of order.”\r\n\r\nAlthough this was what political economy decreed, it must not be\r\ninferred that the greater economists were any more advocates of mere\r\nlicense than Prince Kropotkin, or Mr. Herbert Spencer, or Mr. Benjamin\r\nTucker of Boston, or any other modern Anarchist. They did not admit\r\nthat the alternative to State regulation was anarchy; they held that\r\nNature had provided an all-powerful automatic regulator in Competition;\r\nand that by its operation self-interest would evolve order out of chaos\r\nif only it were allowed its own way. They loved to believe that a right\r\nand just social order was not an artificial and painfully maintained\r\nlegal edifice, but a spontaneous outcome of the free play of the forces\r\nof Nature. They were reactionaries against feudal domineering and\r\nmedieval meddling and ecclesiastical intolerance; and they were able\r\nto shew how all three had ended in disgraceful failure, corruption\r\nand self-stultification. Indignant at the spectacle of the peasant\r\nstruggling against the denial of those rights of private property\r\nwhich his feudal lord had successfully usurped, they strenuously\r\naffirmed the right of private property for all. And whilst they were\r\ndazzled by the prodigious impulse given to production by the industrial\r\nrevolution under competitive private enterprise, they were at the\r\nsame time, for want of statistics, so optimistically ignorant of the\r\ncondition of the masses, that we find David Hume, in 1766, writing to\r\nTurgot that “no man is so industrious but he may add some hours more in\r\nthe week to his labor; and scarce anyone is so poor but he can retrench\r\nsomething of his expense.” No student ever gathers from a study of the\r\nindividualist economists that the English proletariat was seething\r\nin horror and degradation whilst the riches of the proprietors were\r\nincreasing by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nThe historical ignorance of the economists did not, however, disable\r\nthem for the abstract work of scientific political economy. All their\r\nmost cherished institutions and doctrines succumbed one by one to\r\ntheir analysis of the laws of production and exchange. With one law\r\nalone--the law of rent--they destroyed the whole series of assumptions\r\nupon which private property is based. The apriorist notion that among\r\nfree competitors wealth must go to the industrious, and poverty be\r\nthe just and natural punishment of the lazy and improvident, proved\r\nas illusory as the apparent flatness of the earth. Here was a vast\r\nmass of wealth called economic rent, increasing with the population,\r\nand consisting of the difference between the product of the national\r\nindustry as it actually was and as it would have been if every acre of\r\nland in the country had been no more fertile or favorably situated than\r\nthe very worst acre from which a bare living could be extracted: all\r\nquite incapable of being assigned to this or that individual or class\r\nas the return to his or its separate exertions: all purely social or\r\ncommon wealth, for the private appropriation of which no permanently\r\nvalid and intellectually honest excuse could be made. Ricardo was quite\r\nas explicit and far more thorough on the subject than Mr. Henry George.\r\nHe pointed out--I quote his own words--that “the whole surplus produce\r\nof the soil, after deducting from it only such moderate profits as\r\nare sufficient to encourage accumulation, must finally rest with the\r\nlandlord.”[76]\r\n\r\nIt was only by adopting a preposterous theory of value that Ricardo\r\nwas able to maintain that the laborer, selling himself for wages to\r\nthe proprietor, would always command his cost of production, _i.e._,\r\nhis daily subsistence. Even that slender consolation vanished later\r\non before the renewed investigation of value made by Jevons,[77]\r\nwho demonstrated that the value of a commodity is a function of the\r\nquantity available, and may fall to zero when the supply outruns the\r\ndemand so far as to make the final increment of the supply useless.[78]\r\nA fact which the unemployed had discovered, without the aid of the\r\ndifferential calculus, before Jevons was born. Private property, in\r\nfact, left no room for new comers. Malthus pointed this out, and\r\nurged that there should be no newcomers, that the population should\r\nremain stationary. But the population took exactly as much notice of\r\nthis modest demand for stagnation, as the incoming tide took of King\r\nCanute’s ankles. Indeed the demand was the less reasonable since the\r\npower of production per head was increasing faster than the population\r\n(as it still is), the increase of poverty being produced simply by the\r\nincrease and private appropriation of rent. After Ricardo had completed\r\nthe individualist synthesis of production and exchange, a dialectical\r\nwar broke out. Proudhon had only to skim through a Ricardian treatise\r\nto understand just enough of it to be able to shew that political\r\neconomy was a _reductio ad absurdum_ of private property instead of a\r\njustification of it. Ferdinand Lassalle, with Ricardo in one hand and\r\nHegel in the other, turned all the heavy guns of the philosophers and\r\neconomists on private property with such effect, that no one dared to\r\nchallenge his characteristic boasts of the irresistible equipment of\r\nSocial Democracy in point of culture. Karl Marx, without even giving up\r\nthe Ricardian value theory, seized on the blue books which contained\r\nthe true history of the leaps and bounds of England’s prosperity,\r\nand convicted private property of wholesale spoliation, murder and\r\ncompulsory prostitution; of plague, pestilence, and famine; battle,\r\nmurder, and sudden death. This was hardly what had been expected from\r\nan institution so highly spoken of. Many critics said that the attack\r\nwas not fair: no one ventured to pretend that the charges were not\r\ntrue. The facts were not only admitted; they had been legislated\r\nupon. Social Democracy was working itself out practically as well as\r\nacademically. Before I recite the steps of the transition, I will, as\r\na matter of form, explain what Social Democracy is, though doubtless\r\nnearly all my hearers are already conversant with it.\r\n\r\nWhat the achievement of Socialism involves economically, is the\r\ntransfer of rent from the class which now appropriates it to the whole\r\npeople. Rent being that part of the produce which is individually\r\nunearned, this is the only equitable method of disposing of it. There\r\nis no means of getting rid of economic rent. So long as the fertility\r\nof land varies from acre to acre, and the number of persons passing by\r\na shop window per hour varies from street to street, with the result\r\nthat two farmers or two shopkeepers of exactly equal intelligence and\r\nindustry will reap unequal returns from their year’s work, so long\r\nwill it be equitable to take from the richer farmer or shopkeeper the\r\nexcess over his fellow’s gain which he owes to the bounty of Nature\r\nor the advantage of situation, and divide that excess of rent equally\r\nbetween the two. If the pair of farms or shops be left in the hands of\r\na private landlord, he will take the excess, and, instead of dividing\r\nit between his two tenants, live on it himself idly at their expense.\r\nThe economic object of Socialism is not, of course, to equalise farmers\r\nand shopkeepers in couples, but to carry out the principle over the\r\nwhole community by collecting all rents and throwing them into the\r\nnational treasury. As the private proprietor has no reason for clinging\r\nto his property except the legal power to take the rent and spend it\r\non himself--this legal power being in fact what really constitutes\r\nhim a proprietor--its abrogation would mean his expropriation. The\r\nsocialisation of rent would mean the socialisation of the sources of\r\nproduction by the expropriation of the present private proprietors, and\r\nthe transfer of their property to the entire nation. This transfer,\r\nthen, is the subject matter of the transition to Socialism, which began\r\nsome forty-five years ago, as far as any phase of social evolution can\r\nbe said to begin at all.\r\n\r\nIt will be at once seen that the valid objections to Socialism consist\r\nwholly of practical difficulties. On the ground of abstract justice,\r\nSocialism is not only unobjectionable, but sacredly imperative. I\r\nam afraid that in the ordinary middle-class opinion Socialism is\r\nflagrantly dishonest, but could be established off-hand to-morrow with\r\nthe help of a guillotine, if there were no police, and the people were\r\nwicked enough. In truth, it is as honest as it is inevitable; but all\r\nthe mobs and guillotines in the world can no more establish it than\r\npolice coercion can avert it. The first practical difficulty is raised\r\nby the idea of the entire people collectively owning land, capital, or\r\nanything else. Here is the rent arising out of the people’s industry:\r\nhere are the pockets of the private proprietors. The problem is to\r\ndrop that rent, not into those private pockets, but into the people’s\r\npocket. Yes; but where is the people’s pocket? Who is the people?\r\nwhat is the people? Tom we know, and Dick: also Harry; but solely and\r\nseparately as individuals: as a trinity they have no existence. Who is\r\ntheir trustee, their guardian, their man of business, their manager,\r\ntheir secretary, even their stakeholder? The Socialist is stopped\r\ndead at the threshold of practical action by this difficulty until he\r\nbethinks himself of the State as the representative and trustee of the\r\npeople. Now if you will just form a hasty picture of the governments\r\nwhich called themselves States in Ricardo’s day, consisting of rich\r\nproprietors legislating either by divine right or by the exclusive\r\nsuffrage of the poorer proprietors, and filling the executives with the\r\ncreatures of their patronage and favoritism; if you look beneath their\r\noratorical parliamentary discussions, conducted with all the splendor\r\nand decorum of an expensive sham fight; if you consider their class\r\ninterests, their shameless corruption, and the waste and mismanagement\r\nwhich disgraced all their bungling attempts at practical business\r\nof any kind, you will understand why Ricardo, clearly as he saw the\r\neconomic consequences of private appropriation of rent, never dreamt of\r\nState appropriation as a possible alternative. The Socialist of that\r\ntime did not greatly care: he was only a benevolent Utopian who planned\r\nmodel communities, and occasionally carried them out, with negatively\r\ninstructive and positively disastrous results. When his successors\r\nlearned economies from Ricardo, they saw the difficulty quite as\r\nplainly as Ricardo’s vulgarisers, the Whig doctrinaires who accepted\r\nthe incompetence and corruption of States as permanent inherent State\r\nqualities, like the acidity of lemons. Not that the Socialists were not\r\ndoctrinaires too; but outside economics they were pupils of Hegel,\r\nwhilst the Whigs were pupils of Bentham and Austin. Bentham’s was not\r\nthe school in which men learned to solve problems to which history\r\nalone could give the key, or to form conceptions which belonged to\r\nthe evolutional order. Hegel, on the other hand, expressly taught the\r\nconception of the perfect State; and his pupils saw that nothing in\r\nthe nature of things made it impossible, or even specially difficult,\r\nto make the existing State, if not absolutely perfect, at least\r\npractically trustworthy. They contemplated the insolent and inefficient\r\ngovernment official of their day without rushing to the conclusion that\r\nthe State uniform had a magic property of extinguishing all business\r\ncapacity, integrity, and common civility in the wearer. When State\r\nofficials obtained their posts by favoritism and patronage, efficiency\r\non their part was an accident, and politeness a condescension. When\r\nthey retained their posts without any effective responsibility to the\r\npublic, they naturally defrauded the public by making their posts\r\nsinecures, and insulted the public when, by personal inquiry, it made\r\nitself troublesome. But every successfully conducted private business\r\nestablishment in the kingdom was an example of the ease with which\r\npublic ones could be reformed as soon as there was the effective will\r\nto find out the way. Make the passing of a sufficient examination\r\nan indispensable preliminary to entering the executive; make the\r\nexecutive responsible to the government and the government responsible\r\nto the people; and State departments will be provided with all the\r\nguarantees for integrity and efficiency that private money-hunting\r\npretends to. Thus the old bugbear of State imbecility did not terrify\r\nthe Socialist: it only made him a Democrat. But to call himself so\r\nsimply, would have had the effect of classing him with the ordinary\r\ndestructive politician who is a Democrat without ulterior views for\r\nthe sake of formal Democracy--one whose notion of Radicalism is the\r\npulling up of aristocratic institutions by the roots--who is, briefly,\r\na sort of Universal Abolitionist. Consequently, we have the distinctive\r\nterm Social Democrat, indicating the man or woman who desires through\r\nDemocracy to gather the whole people into the State, so that the State\r\nmay be trusted with the rent of the country, and finally with the land,\r\nthe capital, and the organisation of the national industry--with all\r\nthe sources of production, in short, which are now abandoned to the\r\ncupidity of irresponsible private individuals.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of such a change as this are so obvious to all except\r\nthe existing private proprietors and their parasites, that it is very\r\nnecessary to insist on the impossibility of effecting it suddenly. The\r\nyoung Socialist is apt to be catastrophic in his views--to plan the\r\nrevolutionary programme as an affair of twenty-four lively hours, with\r\nIndividualism in full swing on Monday morning, a tidal wave of the\r\ninsurgent proletariat on Monday afternoon, and Socialism in complete\r\nworking order on Tuesday. A man who believes that such a happy despatch\r\nis possible, will naturally think it absurd and even inhuman to stick\r\nat bloodshed in bringing it about. He can prove that the continuance\r\nof the present system for a year costs more suffering than could be\r\ncrammed into any Monday afternoon, however sanguinary. This is the\r\nphase of conviction in which are delivered those Socialist speeches\r\nwhich make what the newspapers call “good copy,” and which are the only\r\nones they as yet report. Such speeches are encouraged by the hasty\r\nopposition they evoke from thoughtless persons, who begin by tacitly\r\nadmitting that a sudden change is feasible, and go on to protest that\r\nit would be wicked. The experienced Social Democrat converts his too\r\nardent follower by first admitting that if the change could be made\r\ncatastrophically it would be well worth making, and then proceeding\r\nto point out that as it would involve a readjustment of productive\r\nindustry to meet the demand created by an entirely new distribution\r\nof purchasing power, it would also involve, in the application of\r\nlabor and industrial machinery, alterations which no afternoon’s work\r\ncould effect. You cannot convince any man that it is impossible to\r\ntear down a government in a day; but everybody is convinced already\r\nthat you cannot convert first and third class carriages into second\r\nclass; rookeries and palaces into comfortable dwellings; and jewellers\r\nand dressmakers into bakers and builders, by merely singing the\r\n“Marseillaise.” No judicious person, however deeply persuaded that the\r\nwork of the court dressmaker has no true social utility, would greatly\r\ncare to quarter her idly on the genuinely productive workers pending\r\nthe preparation of a place for her in their ranks. For though she is\r\nto all intents and purposes quartered on them at present, yet she at\r\nleast escapes the demoralisation of idleness. Until her new place is\r\nready, it is better that her patrons should find dressmaking for her\r\nhands to do, than that Satan should find mischief. Demolishing a\r\nBastille with seven prisoners in it is one thing: demolishing one with\r\nfourteen million prisoners is quite another. I need not enlarge on the\r\npoint: the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious\r\nto everyone here, and could be made obvious to everyone elsewhere if\r\nonly the catastrophists were courageously and sensibly dealt with in\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nWhat then does a gradual transition to Social Democracy mean\r\nspecifically? It means the gradual extension of the franchise; and the\r\ntransfer of rent and interest to the State, not in one lump sum, but\r\nby instalments. Looked at in this way, it will at once be seen that\r\nwe are already far on the road, and are being urged further by many\r\npoliticians who do not dream that they are touched with Socialism--nay,\r\nwho would earnestly repudiate the touch as a taint. Let us see how far\r\nwe have gone. In 1832 the political power passed into the hands of\r\nthe middle class; and in 1838 Lord John Russell announced finality.\r\nMeanwhile, in 1834, the middle class had swept away the last economic\r\nrefuge of the workers, the old Poor Law, and delivered them naked to\r\nthe furies of competition.[79] Ten years turmoil and active emigration\r\nfollowed; and then the thin end of the wedge went in. The Income\r\nTax was established; and the Factory Acts were made effective. The\r\nIncome Tax (1842), which is on individualist principles an intolerable\r\nspoliative anomaly, is simply a forcible transfer of rent, interest,\r\nand even rent of ability, from private holders to the State without\r\ncompensation. It excused itself to the Whigs on the ground that those\r\nwho had most property for the State to protect should pay _ad valorem_\r\nfor its protection. The Factory Acts swept the anarchic theory of the\r\nirresponsibility of private enterprise out of practical politics;\r\nmade employers accountable to the State for the well-being of their\r\nemployees; and transferred a further instalment of profits directly\r\nto the worker by raising wages. Then came the gold discoveries in\r\nCalifornia (1847) and Australia (1851), and the period of leaps and\r\nbounds, supported by the economic rent of England’s mineral fertility,\r\nwhich kindled Mr. Gladstone’s retrogressive instincts to a vain hope of\r\nabolishing the Income Tax. These events relieved the pressure set up\r\nby the New Poor Law. The workers rapidly organized themselves in Trades\r\nUnions, which were denounced then for their tendency to sap the manly\r\nindependence which had formerly characterized the British workman,[80]\r\nand which are to-day held up to him as the self-helpful perfection of\r\nthat manly independence. Howbeit, self-help flourished, especially at\r\nManchester and Sheffield; State help was voted grandmotherly; wages\r\nwent up; and the Unions, like the fly on the wheel, thought that they\r\nhad raised them. They were mistaken; but the value of Trade Unionism\r\nin awakening the social conscience of the skilled workers was immense,\r\nthough to this there was a heavy set-off in its tendency to destroy\r\ntheir artistic conscience by making them aware that it was their duty\r\nto one another to discourage rapid and efficient workmanship by every\r\nmeans in their power. An extension of the franchise, which was really\r\nan instalment of Democracy, and not, like the 1832 Reform Bill, only an\r\nadvance towards it, was gained in 1867; and immediately afterwards came\r\nanother instalment of Socialism in the shape of a further transfer of\r\nrent and interest from private holders to the State for the purpose of\r\neducating the people. In the meantime, the extraordinary success of the\r\npost-office, which, according to the teaching of the Manchester school,\r\nshould have been a nest of incompetence and jobbery, had not only shewn\r\nthe perfect efficiency of State enterprise when the officials are made\r\nresponsible to the class interested in its success, but had also proved\r\nthe enormous convenience and cheapness of socialistic or collectivist\r\ncharges over those of private enterprise. For example, the Postmaster\r\nGeneral charges a penny for sending a letter weighing an ounce from\r\nKensington to Bayswater. Private enterprise would send half a pound the\r\nsame distance for a farthing, and make a handsome profit on it. But the\r\nPostmaster General also sends an ounce letter from Land’s End to John\r\no’ Groat’s House for a penny. Private enterprise would probably demand\r\nat least a shilling, if not five, for such a service; and there are\r\nmany places in which private enterprise could not on any terms maintain\r\na post-office. Therefore a citizen with ten letters to post saves\r\nconsiderably by the uniform socialistic charge, and quite recognises\r\nthe necessity for rigidly protecting the Postmaster’s monopoly.\r\n\r\nAfter 1875,[81] leaping and bounding prosperity, after a final spurt\r\nduring which the Income Tax fell to twopence, got out of breath, and\r\nhas not yet recovered it. Russia and America, among other competitors,\r\nbegan to raise the margin of cultivation at a surprising rate.\r\nEducation began to intensify the sense of suffering, and to throw light\r\nupon its causes in dark places. The capital needed to keep English\r\nindustry abreast of the growing population began to be attracted\r\nby the leaping and bounding of foreign loans and investments,[82]\r\nand to bring to England, in payment of interest, imports that were\r\nnot paid for by exports--a phenomenon inexpressibly disconcerting\r\nto the Cobden Club. The old pressure of the eighteen-thirties came\r\nback again; and presently, as if Chartism and Fergus O’Connor had\r\nrisen from the dead, the Democratic Federation and Mr. H. M. Hyndman\r\nappeared in the field, highly significant as signs of the times, and\r\nlooming hideously magnified in the guilty eye of property, if not\r\nof great account as direct factors in the course of events. Numbers\r\nof young men, pupils of Mill, Spencer, Comte, and Darwin, roused by\r\nMr. Henry George’s “Progress and Poverty,” left aside evolution and\r\nfreethought; took to insurrectionary economics; studied Karl Marx; and\r\nwere so convinced that Socialism had only to be put clearly before\r\nthe working-classes to concentrate the power of their immense numbers\r\nin one irresistible organization, that the Revolution was fixed for\r\n1889--the anniversary of the French Revolution--at latest. I remember\r\nbeing asked satirically and publicly at that time how long I thought\r\nit would take to get Socialism into working order if I had my way. I\r\nreplied, with a spirited modesty, that a fortnight would be ample for\r\nthe purpose. When I add that I was frequently complimented on being one\r\nof the more reasonable Socialists, you will be able to appreciate the\r\nfervor of our conviction, and the extravagant levity of our practical\r\nideas. The opposition we got was uninstructive: it was mainly founded\r\non the assumption that our projects were theoretically unsound but\r\nimmediately possible, whereas our weak point lay in the case being\r\nexactly the reverse. However, the ensuing years sifted and sobered\r\nus. “The Socialists,” as they were called, have fallen into line as a\r\nSocial Democratic party, no more insurrectionary in its policy than any\r\nother party. But I shall not present the remainder of the transition\r\nto Social Democracy as the work of fully conscious Social Democrats.\r\nI prefer to ignore them altogether--to suppose, if you will, that the\r\nGovernment will shortly follow the advice of the _Saturday Review_,\r\nand, for the sake of peace and quietness, hang them.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as to the consummation of Democracy. Since 1885 every man\r\nwho pays four shillings a week rent can only be hindered from voting\r\nby anomalous conditions of registration which are likely to be swept\r\naway very shortly. This is all but manhood suffrage; and it will soon\r\ncomplete itself as adult suffrage. However, I may leave adult suffrage\r\nout of the question, because the outlawry of women, monstrous as it\r\nis, is not a question of class privilege, but of sex privilege. To\r\ncomplete the foundation of the democratic State, then, we need manhood\r\nsuffrage, abolition of all poverty disqualifications, abolition of\r\nthe House of Lords, public payment of candidature expenses, public\r\npayment of representatives, and annual elections. These changes are now\r\ninevitable, however unacceptable they may appear to those of us who\r\nare Conservatives. They have been for half a century the commonplaces\r\nof Radicalism. We have next to consider that the State is not merely\r\nan abstraction: it is a machine to do certain work; and if that work\r\nbe increased and altered in its character, the machinery must be\r\nmultiplied and altered too. Now, the extension of the franchise does\r\nincrease and alter the work very considerably; but it has no direct\r\neffect on the machinery. At present the State machine has practically\r\nbroken down under the strain of spreading democracy, the work being\r\nmainly local, and the machinery mainly central. Without efficient local\r\nmachinery the replacing of private enterprise by State enterprise is\r\nout of the question; and we shall presently see that such replacement\r\nis one of the inevitable consequences of Democracy. A democratic State\r\ncannot become a _Social_-Democratic State unless it has in every\r\ncentre of population a local governing body as thoroughly democratic\r\nin its constitution as the central Parliament. This matter is also\r\nwell in train. In 1888 a Government avowedly reactionary passed a\r\nLocal Government Bill which effected a distinct advance towards the\r\ndemocratic municipality.[83] It was furthermore a Bill with no single\r\naspect of finality anywhere about it. Local Self-Government remains\r\nprominent within the sphere of practical politics. When it is achieved,\r\nthe democratic State will have the machinery for Socialism.\r\n\r\nAnd now, how is the raw material of Socialism--otherwise the\r\nProletarian man--to be brought to the Democratic State machinery? Here\r\nagain the path is easily found. Politicians who have no suspicion\r\nthat they are Socialists, are advocating further instalments of\r\nSocialism with a recklessness of indirect results which scandalizes the\r\nconscious Social Democrat. The phenomenon of economic rent has assumed\r\nprodigious proportions in our great cities. The injustice of its\r\nprivate appropriation is glaring, flagrant, almost ridiculous. In the\r\nlong suburban roads about London, where rows of exactly similar houses\r\nstretch for miles countrywards, the rent changes at every few thousand\r\nyards by exactly the amount saved or incurred annually in travelling\r\nto and from the householder’s place of business. The seeker after\r\nlodgings, hesitating between Bloomsbury and Tottenham, finds every\r\nadvantage of situation skimmed off by the landlord with scientific\r\nprecision. As lease after lease falls in, houses, shops, goodwills of\r\nbusinesses which are the fruits of the labor of lifetimes, fall into\r\nthe maw of the ground landlord. Confiscation of capital, spoliation\r\nof households, annihilation of incentive, everything that the most\r\nignorant and credulous fundholder ever charged against the Socialist,\r\nrages openly in London, which begins to ask itself whether it exists\r\nand toils only for the typical duke and his celebrated jockey and his\r\nfamous racehorse. Lord Hobhouse and his unimpeachably respectable\r\ncommittee for the taxation of ground values are already in the field\r\nclaiming the value of the site of London for London collectively; and\r\ntheir agitation receives additional momentum from every lease that\r\nfalls in. Their case is unassailable; and the evil they attack is one\r\nthat presses on the ratepaying and leaseholding classes as well as upon\r\nhumbler sufferers. This economic pressure is reinforced formidably by\r\npolitical opinion in the workmen’s associations. Here the moderate\r\nmembers are content to demand a progressive Income Tax, which is\r\nvirtually Lord Hobhouse’s proposal; and the extremists are all for Land\r\nNationalisation, which is again Lord Hobhouse’s principle. The cry for\r\nsuch taxation cannot permanently be resisted. And it is very worthy\r\nof remark that there is a new note in the cry. Formerly taxes were\r\nproposed with a specific object--as to pay for a war, for education,\r\nor the like. Now the proposal is to tax the landlords in order to get\r\nsome of _our_ money back from them--take it from them first and find\r\na use for it afterwards. Ever since Mr. Henry George’s book reached\r\nthe English Radicals, there has been a growing disposition to impose\r\na tax of twenty shillings in the pound on obviously unearned incomes;\r\nthat is, to dump four hundred and fifty millions[84] a year down on\r\nthe Exchequer counter; and then retire with three cheers for the\r\nrestoration of the land to the people.\r\n\r\nThe results of such a proceeding, if it actually came off, would\r\nconsiderably take its advocates aback. The streets would presently\r\nbe filled with starving workers of all grades, domestic servants,\r\ncoach-builders, decorators, jewellers, lace-makers, fashionable\r\nprofessional men, and numberless others whose livelihood is at present\r\ngained by ministering to the wants of these and of the proprietary\r\nclass. “This,” they would cry, “is what your theories have brought\r\nus to! Back with the good old times, when we received our wages,\r\nwhich were at least better than nothing.” Evidently the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer would have three courses open to him. (1) He would\r\ngive the money back again to the landlords and capitalists with an\r\napology. (2) He could attempt to start State industries with it for the\r\nemployment of the people. (3) Or he could simply distribute it among\r\nthe unemployed. The last is not to be thought of: anything is better\r\nthan _panem et circenses_. The second (starting State industries)\r\nwould be far too vast an undertaking to get on foot soon enough to\r\nmeet the urgent difficulty. The first (the return with an apology)\r\nwould be a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the whole affair--a confession\r\nthat the private proprietor, for all his idleness and his voracity,\r\nis indeed performing an indispensable economic function--the function\r\nof capitalising, however wastefully and viciously, the wealth\r\nwhich surpasses his necessarily limited power of immediate personal\r\nconsumption. And here we have checkmate to mere Henry Georgism, or\r\nState appropriation of rent without Socialism. It is easy to shew that\r\nthe State is entitled to the whole income of the Duke of Westminster,\r\nand to argue therefrom that he should straightway be taxed twenty\r\nshillings in the pound. But in practical earnest the State has no right\r\nto take five farthings of capital from the Duke or anybody else until\r\nit is ready to invest them in productive enterprise. The consequences\r\nof withdrawing capital from private hands merely to lock it up\r\nunproductively in the treasury would be so swift and ruinous, that no\r\nstatesman, however fortified with the destructive resources of abstract\r\neconomics, could persist in it. It will be found in the future as in\r\nthe past that governments will raise money only because they want it\r\nfor specific purposes, and not on _a priori_ demonstrations that they\r\nhave a right to it. But it must be added that when they _do_ want it\r\nfor a specific purpose, then, also in the future as in the past, they\r\nwill raise it without the slightest regard to _a priori_ demonstrations\r\nthat they have no right to it.\r\n\r\nHere then we have got to a dead lock. In spite of democrats and land\r\nnationalisers, rent cannot be touched unless some pressure from\r\nquite another quarter forces productive enterprise on the State.\r\nSuch pressure is already forthcoming. The quick starvation of the\r\nunemployed, the slow starvation of the employed who have no relatively\r\nscarce special skill, the unbearable anxiety or dangerous recklessness\r\nof those who are employed to-day and unemployed to-morrow, the rise in\r\nurban rents, the screwing down of wages by pauper immigration and home\r\nmultiplication, the hand-in-hand advance of education and discontent,\r\nare all working up to explosion point. It is useless to prove by\r\nstatistics that most of the people are better off than before, true as\r\nthat probably is, thanks to instalments of Social Democracy. Yet even\r\nthat is questionable; for it is idle to claim authority for statistics\r\nof things that have never been recorded. Chaos has no statistics: it\r\nhas only statisticians; and the ablest of them prefaces his remarks\r\non the increased consumption of rice by the admission that “no one\r\ncan contemplate the present condition of the masses without desiring\r\nsomething like a revolution for the better.”[85] The masses themselves\r\nare being converted so rapidly to that view of the situation, that we\r\nhave Pan-Anglican Synods, bewildered by a revival of Christianity,\r\npleading that though Socialism is eminently Christian, yet “the Church\r\nmust act safely as well as sublimely.”[86] During the agitation made\r\nby the unemployed last winter (1887-8), the Chief Commissioner of\r\nPolice in London started at his own shadow, and mistook Mr. John Burns\r\nfor the French Revolution, to the great delight of that genial and\r\ncourageous champion of his class.[87] The existence of the pressure\r\nis further shewn by the number and variety of safety valves proposed\r\nto relieve it--monetization of silver, import duties, “leaseholds\r\nenfranchisement,” extension of joint-stock capitalism masquerading as\r\nco-operation,[88] and other irrelevancies. My own sudden promotion from\r\nthe street corner to this platform is in its way a sign of the times.\r\nBut whilst we are pointing the moral and adorning the tale according\r\nto our various opinions, an actual struggle is beginning between the\r\nunemployed who demand work and the local authorities appointed to\r\ndeal with the poor. In the winter, the unemployed collect round red\r\nflags, and listen to speeches for want of anything else to do. They\r\nwelcome Socialism, insurrectionism, currency craze--anything that\r\npasses the time and seems to express the fact that they are hungry.\r\nThe local authorities, equally innocent of studied economic views,\r\ndeny that there is any misery; send leaders of deputations to the\r\nLocal Government Board, who promptly send them back to the guardians;\r\ntry bullying; try stoneyards; try bludgeoning; and finally sit down\r\nhelplessly and wish it were summer again or the unemployed at the\r\nbottom of the sea. Meanwhile the charity fund, which is much less\r\nelastic than the wages fund, overflows at the Mansion House only to\r\nrun dry at the permanent institutions. So unstable a state of things\r\ncannot last. The bludgeoning, and the shocking clamor for bloodshed\r\nfrom the anti-popular newspapers, will create a revulsion among the\r\nhumane section of the middle class. The section which is blinded\r\nby class prejudice to all sense of social responsibility, dreads\r\npersonal violence from the working class with a superstitious terror\r\nthat defies enlightenment or control.[89] Municipal employment must\r\nbe offered at last. This cannot be done in one place alone: the rush\r\nfrom other parts of the country would swamp an isolated experiment.\r\nWherever the pressure is, the relief must be given on the spot.\r\nAnd since public decency, as well as consideration for its higher\r\nofficials, will prevent the County Council from instituting a working\r\nday of sixteen hours at a wage of a penny an hour or less, it will\r\nsoon have on its hands not only the unemployed, but also the white\r\nslaves of the sweater, who will escape from their dens and appeal to\r\nthe municipality for work the moment they become aware that municipal\r\nemployment is better than private sweating. Nay, the sweater himself,\r\na mere slave driver paid “by the piece,” will in many instances be\r\nas anxious as his victims to escape from his hideous trade. But the\r\nmunicipal organisation of the industry of these people will require\r\ncapital. Where is the municipality to get it? Raising the rates is\r\nout of the question: the ordinary tradesmen and householders are\r\nalready rated and rented to the limit of endurance: further burdens\r\nwould almost bring them into the street with a red flag. Dreadful\r\ndilemma! in which the County Council, between the devil and the deep\r\nsea, will hear Lord Hobhouse singing a song of deliverance, telling\r\na golden tale of ground values to be municipalised by taxation. The\r\nland nationalisers will swell the chorus: the Radical progressive\r\nincome taxers singing together, and the ratepaying tenants shouting\r\nfor joy. The capital difficulty thus solved--for we need not seriously\r\nanticipate that the landlords will actually fight, as our President[90]\r\nonce threatened--the question of acquiring land will arise. The\r\nnationalisers will declare for its annexation by the municipality\r\nwithout compensation; but that will be rejected as spoliation, worthy\r\nonly of revolutionary Socialists. The no-compensation cry is indeed\r\na piece of unpractical catastrophic insurrectionism; for whilst\r\ncompensation would be unnecessary and absurd if every proprietor\r\nwere expropriated simultaneously, and the proprietary system at once\r\nreplaced by full blown Socialism, yet when it is necessary to proceed\r\nby degrees, the denial of compensation would have the effect of\r\nsingling out individual proprietors for expropriation whilst the others\r\nremained unmolested, and depriving them of their private means long\r\nbefore there was suitable municipal employment ready for them. The\r\nland, as it is required, will therefore be honestly purchased; and the\r\npurchase money, or the interest thereon, will be procured, like the\r\ncapital, by taxing rent. Of course this will be at bottom an act of\r\nexpropriation just as much as the collection of Income Tax to-day is an\r\nact of expropriation. As such, it will be denounced by the landlords\r\nas merely a committing of the newest sin the oldest kind of way. In\r\neffect, they will be compelled at each purchase to buy out one of their\r\nbody and present his land to the municipality, thereby distributing the\r\nloss fairly over their whole class, instead of placing it on one man\r\nwho is no more responsible than the rest. But they will be compelled to\r\ndo this in a manner that will satisfy the moral sense of the ordinary\r\ncitizen as effectively as that of the skilled economist.\r\n\r\nWe now foresee our municipality equipped with land and capital for\r\nindustrial purposes. At first they will naturally extend the industries\r\nthey already carry on, road making, gas works, tramways, building, and\r\nthe like. It is probable that they will for the most part regard their\r\naction as a mere device to meet a passing emergency. The Manchester\r\nSchool will urge its Protectionist theories as to the exemption of\r\nprivate enterprise from the competition of public enterprise, in one\r\nsupreme effort to practise for the last time on popular ignorance of\r\nthe science which it has consistently striven to debase and stultify.\r\nFor a while the proprietary party will succeed in hampering and\r\nrestricting municipal enterprise;[91] in attaching the stigma of\r\npauperism to its service; in keeping the lot of its laborers as nearly\r\nas possible down to private competition level in point of hard work\r\nand low wages. But its power will be broken by the disappearance of\r\nthat general necessity for keeping down the rates which now hardens\r\nlocal authority to humane appeals. The luxury of being generous at\r\nsomeone else’s expense will be irresistible. The ground landlord will\r\nbe the municipal milch cow; and the ordinary ratepayers will feel the\r\nadvantage of sleeping in peace, relieved at once from the fear of\r\nincreased burdens and of having their windows broken and their premises\r\nlooted by hungry mobs, nuclei of all the socialism and scoundrelism of\r\nthe city. They will have just as much remorse in making the landlord\r\npay as the landlord has had in making them pay--just as much and\r\nno more. And as the municipality becomes more democratic, it will\r\nfind landlordism losing power, not only relatively to democracy, but\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary ratepayer, however, will not remain unaffected for long.\r\nAt the very outset of the new extension of municipal industries, the\r\nquestion of wage will arise. A minimum wage must be fixed; and though\r\nat first, to avoid an overwhelming rush of applicants for employment,\r\nit must be made too small to tempt any decently employed laborer to\r\nforsake his place and run to the municipality, still, it will not be\r\nthe frankly infernal competition wage. It will be, like mediæval wages,\r\nfixed with at least some reference to public opinion as to a becoming\r\nstandard of comfort. Over and above this, the municipality will\r\nhave to pay to its organisers, managers, and incidentally necessary\r\nskilled workers the full market price of their ability, minus only\r\nwhat the superior prestige and permanence of public employment may\r\ninduce them to accept. But whilst these high salaries will make no\r\nmore disturbance in the labor market than the establishment of a new\r\njoint-stock company would, the minimum wage for laborers will affect\r\nthat market perceptibly. The worst sort of sweaters will find that if\r\nthey are to keep their “hands,” they must treat them at least as well\r\nas the municipality. The consequent advance in wage will swallow up the\r\nsweater’s narrow margin of profit. Hence the sweater must raise the\r\nprice per piece against the shops and wholesale houses for which he\r\nsweats. This again will diminish the profits of the wholesale dealers\r\nand shopkeepers, who will not be able to recover this loss by raising\r\nthe price of their wares against the public, since, had any such step\r\nbeen possible, they would have taken it before. But fortunately for\r\nthem, the market value of their ability as men of business is fixed\r\nby the same laws that govern the prices of commodities. Just as the\r\nsweater is worth his profit, so they are worth their profit; and just\r\nas the sweater will be able to exact from them his old remuneration in\r\nspite of the advance in wages, so they will be able to exact their old\r\nremuneration in spite of the advance in sweaters’ terms. But from whom,\r\nit will be asked, if not from the public by raising the price of the\r\nwares? Evidently from the landlord upon whose land they are organising\r\nproduction. In other words, they will demand and obtain a reduction of\r\nrent. Thus the organiser of industry, the employer pure and simple, the\r\n_entrepreneur_, as he is often called in economic treatises nowadays,\r\nwill not suffer. In the division of the product his share will remain\r\nconstant; whilst the industrious wage-worker’s share will be increased,\r\nand the idle proprietor’s share diminished. This will not adjust itself\r\nwithout friction and clamor; but such friction is constantly going on\r\nunder the present system in the opposite direction, _i.e._, by the\r\nraising of the proprietor’s share at the expense of the worker’s.\r\n\r\nThe contraction of landlords’ incomes will necessarily diminish\r\nthe revenue from taxation on such incomes. Let us suppose that the\r\nmunicipality, to maintain its revenue, puts on an additional penny\r\nin the pound. The effect will be to burn the landlord’s candle at\r\nboth ends--obviously not a process that can be continued to infinity.\r\nBut long before taxation fails as a source of municipal capital, the\r\nmunicipalities will have begun to save capital out of the product of\r\ntheir own industries. In the market the competition of those industries\r\nwith the private concerns will be irresistible. Unsaddled with a single\r\nidle person, and having, therefore, nothing to provide for after paying\r\ntheir employees except extension of capital, they will be able to offer\r\nwages that no business burdened with the unproductive consumption of\r\nan idle landlord or shareholder could afford, unless it yielded a\r\nheavy rent in consequence of some marked advantage of site. But even\r\nrents, when they are town rents, are at the mercy of a municipality\r\nin the long run. The masters of the streets and the traffic can nurse\r\none site and neglect another. The rent of a shop depends on the number\r\nof persons passing its windows per hour. A skilfully timed series of\r\nexperiments in paving, a new bridge, a tramway service, a barracks,\r\nor a small-pox hospital are only a few of the circumstances of which\r\ncity rents are the creatures. The power of the municipality to control\r\nthese circumstances is as obvious as the impotence of competing private\r\nindividuals. Again, competing private individuals are compelled to sell\r\ntheir produce at a price equivalent to the full cost of production at\r\nthe margin of cultivation.[92] The municipality could compete against\r\nthem by reducing prices to the average cost of production over the\r\nwhole area of municipal cultivation. The more favorably situated\r\nprivate concerns could only meet this by ceasing to pay rent; the less\r\nfavorably situated would succumb without remedy. It would be either\r\nstalemate or checkmate. Private property would either become barren, or\r\nit would yield to the actual cultivator of average ability no better an\r\nincome than could be obtained more securely in municipal employment.\r\nTo the mere proprietor it would yield nothing. Eventually the land and\r\nindustry of the whole town would pass by the spontaneous action of\r\neconomic forces into the hands of the municipality; and, so far, the\r\nproblem of socialising industry would be solved.\r\n\r\nPrivate property, by cheapening the laborer to the utmost in order\r\nto get the greater surplus out of him, lowers the margin of human\r\ncultivation, and so raises the “rent of ability.” The most important\r\nform of that rent is the profit of industrial management. The gains\r\nof a great portrait painter or fashionable physician are much less\r\nsignificant, since these depend entirely on the existence of a very\r\nrich class of patrons subject to acute vanity and hypochondriasis. But\r\nthe industrial organiser is independent of patrons: instead of merely\r\nattracting a larger share of the product of industry to himself, he\r\nincreases the product by his management. The market price of such\r\nability depends upon the relation of the supply to the demand: the\r\nmore there is of it the cheaper it is: the less, the dearer. Any cause\r\nthat increases the supply lowers the price. Now it is evident that\r\nsince a manager must be a man of education and address, it is useless\r\nto look ordinarily to the laboring class for a supply of managerial\r\nskill. Not one laborer in a million succeeds in raising himself on\r\nthe shoulders of his fellows by extraordinary gifts, or extraordinary\r\nluck, or both. The managers must be drawn from the classes which\r\nenjoy education and social culture; and their price, rapidly as it\r\nis falling with the spread of education and the consequent growth of\r\nthe “intellectual proletariat,” is still high. It is true that a very\r\nable and highly-trained manager can now be obtained for about £800 a\r\nyear, provided his post does not compel him to spend two-thirds of\r\nhis income on what is called “keeping up his position,” instead of on\r\nhis own gratification.[93] Still, when it is considered that laborers\r\nreceive less than £50 a year, and that the demand for laborers is\r\nnecessarily vast in proportion to the demand for able managers, nay,\r\nthat there is an inverse ratio between them, since the manager’s talent\r\nis valuable in proportion to quantity of labor he can organise, it will\r\nbe admitted that £800 a year represents an immense rent of ability.\r\nBut if the education and culture which are a practically indispensable\r\npart of the equipment of competitors for such posts were enjoyed by\r\nmillions instead of thousands, that rent would fall considerably. Now\r\nthe tendency of private property is to keep the masses mere beasts of\r\nburden. The tendency of Social Democracy is to educate them, to make\r\nmen of them. Social Democracy would not long be saddled with the rents\r\nof ability which have during the last century made our born captains of\r\nindustry our masters and tyrants instead of our servants and leaders.\r\nIt is even conceivable that rent of managerial ability might in course\r\nof time become negative,[94] astonishing as that may seem to the many\r\npersons who are by this time so hopelessly confused amid existing\r\nanomalies, that the proposition that “whosoever of you will be the\r\nchiefest, shall be servant of all,” strikes them rather as a Utopian\r\nparadox than as the most obvious and inevitable of social arrangements.\r\nThe fall in the rent of ability will, however, benefit not only the\r\nmunicipality, but also its remaining private competitors. Nevertheless,\r\nas the prestige of the municipality grows, and as men see more and\r\nmore clearly what the future is to it, able organisers will take lower\r\nsalaries for municipal than for private employment; whilst those who\r\ncan beat even the municipality at organising, or who, as professional\r\nmen, can deal personally with the public without the intervention of\r\nindustrial organisation, will pay the rent of their places of business\r\neither directly to the municipality, or to the private landlord whose\r\nincome the municipality will absorb by taxation. Finally, when rents\r\nof ability had reached their irreducible natural level, they could be\r\ndealt with by a progressive Income Tax in the very improbable case of\r\ntheir proving a serious social inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to go further into the economic detail of the\r\nprocess of the extinction of private property. Much of that process\r\nas sketched here may be anticipated by sections of the proprietary\r\nclass successively capitulating, as the net closes about their special\r\ninterests, on such terms as they may be able to stand out for before\r\ntheir power is entirely broken.[95]\r\n\r\nWe may also safely neglect for the moment the question of the\r\ndevelopment of the House of Commons into the central government which\r\nwill be the organ for federating the municipalities, and nationalising\r\ninter-municipal rents by an adjustment of the municipal contributions\r\nto imperial taxation: in short, for discharging national as distinct\r\nfrom local business. One can see that the Local Government Board of\r\nthe future will be a tremendous affair; that foreign States will be\r\ndeeply affected by the reaction of English progress; that international\r\ntrade, always the really dominant factor in foreign policy, will have\r\nto be reconsidered from a new point of view when profit comes to\r\nbe calculated in terms of net social welfare instead of individual\r\npecuniary gain; that our present system of imperial aggression, in\r\nwhich, under pretext of exploration and colonisation, the flag follows\r\nthe filibuster and trade follows the flag, with the missionary bringing\r\nup the rear, must collapse when the control of our military forces\r\npasses from the capitalist class to the people; that the disappearance\r\nof a variety of classes with a variety of what are now ridiculously\r\ncalled “public opinions” will be accompanied by the welding of society\r\ninto one class with a public opinion of inconceivable weight; that this\r\npublic opinion will make it for the first time possible effectively\r\nto control the population; that the economic independence of women,\r\nand the supplanting of the head of the household by the individual as\r\nthe recognized unit of the State, will materially alter the status of\r\nchildren and the utility of the institution of the family; and that the\r\ninevitable reconstitution of the State Church on a democratic basis\r\nmay, for example, open up the possibility of the election of an avowed\r\nFreethinker like Mr. John Morley or Mr. Bradlaugh to the deanery of\r\nWestminster. All these things are mentioned only for the sake of a\r\nglimpse of the fertile fields of thought and action which await us when\r\nthe settlement of our bread and butter question leaves us free to use\r\nand develop our higher faculties.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the humdrum programme of the practical Social Democrat\r\nto-day. There is not one new item in it. All are applications of\r\nprinciples already admitted, and extensions of practices already in\r\nfull activity. All have on them that stamp of the vestry which is so\r\ncongenial to the British mind. None of them compel the use of the words\r\nSocialism or Revolution: at no point do they involve guillotining,\r\ndeclaring the Rights of Man, swearing on the altar of the country,\r\nor anything else that is supposed to be essentially un-English. And\r\nthey are all sure to come--landmarks on our course already visible to\r\nfarsighted politicians even of the party which dreads them.\r\n\r\nLet me, in conclusion, disavow all admiration for this inevitable, but\r\nsordid, slow, reluctant, cowardly path to justice. I venture to claim\r\nyour respect for those enthusiasts who still refuse to believe that\r\nmillions of their fellow creatures must be left to sweat and suffer\r\nin hopeless toil and degradation, whilst parliaments and vestries\r\ngrudgingly muddle and grope towards paltry instalments of betterment.\r\nThe right is so clear, the wrong so intolerable, the gospel so\r\nconvincing, that it seems to them that it _must_ be possible to enlist\r\nthe whole body of workers--soldiers, policemen, and all--under the\r\nbanner of brotherhood and equality; and at one great stroke to set\r\nJustice on her rightful throne. Unfortunately, such an army of light\r\nis no more to be gathered from the human product of nineteenth century\r\ncivilisation than grapes are to be gathered from thistles. But if we\r\nfeel glad of that impossibility; if we feel relieved that the change\r\nis to be slow enough to avert personal risk to ourselves; if we feel\r\nanything less than acute disappointment and bitter humiliation at\r\nthe discovery that there is yet between us and the promised land a\r\nwilderness in which many must perish miserably of want and despair:\r\nthen I submit to you that our institutions have corrupted us to the\r\nmost dastardly degree of selfishness. The Socialists need not be\r\nashamed of beginning as they did by proposing militant organisation\r\nof the working classes and general insurrection. The proposal proved\r\nimpracticable; and it has now been abandoned--not without some\r\noutspoken regrets--by English Socialists. But it still remains as the\r\nonly finally possible alternative to the Social Democratic programme\r\nwhich I have sketched to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] An address delivered on the 7th September, 1888, to the Economic\r\nSection of the British Association at Bath.\r\n\r\n[74] Explained in the first essay in this volume.\r\n\r\n[75] See page 57-61.\r\n\r\n[76] “Principles of Political Economy,” chap. xxiv, p. 202.\r\n\r\n[77] “Theory of Political Economy.” By W.

Cases in which the profits of the employer are smaller than\r\nthe wages of the employee are by no means uncommon in certain grades of\r\nindustry where small traders have occasion to employ skilled workmen.\r\n\r\n[95] Such capitulations occur already when the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer takes advantage of the fall in the current rate of interest\r\n(explained on page 20) to reduce Consols. This he does by simply\r\nthreatening to pay off the stockholders with money freshly borrowed at\r\nthe current rate. They, knowing that they could not reinvest the money\r\non any better terms than the reduced ones offered by the Chancellor,\r\nhave to submit. There is no reason why the municipalities should not\r\nsecure the same advantages for their constituents. For example, the\r\ninhabitants of London now pay the shareholders of the gas companies a\r\nmillion and a half annually, or 11 per cent on the £13,650,000 which\r\nthe gas works cost. The London County Council could raise that sum for\r\nabout £400,000 a year. By threatening to do this and start municipal\r\ngas works, it could obviously compel the shareholders to hand over\r\ntheir works for £400,000 a year, and sacrifice the extra 8 per cent\r\nnow enjoyed by them. The saving to the citizens of London would be\r\n£1,000,000 a year, sufficient to defray the net cost of the London\r\nSchool Board. Metropolitan readers will find a number of cognate\r\ninstances in Fabian Tract No. 8, “Facts for Londoners.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLOOK.\r\n\r\nBY HUBERT BLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Webb’s historical review brought us from the “break up of the\r\nold synthesis” (his own phrase), a social system founded on a basis\r\nof religion, a common belief in a divine order, to the point where\r\nperplexed politicians, recognising the futility of the principle of\r\nIndividualism to keep the industrial machine in working order, with\r\n“freedom of contract” upon their lips spent their nights in passing\r\nFactory Acts, and devoted their fiscal ingenuity to cutting slice after\r\nslice off incomes derived from rent and interest. His paper was an\r\ninductive demonstration of the failure of anarchy to meet the needs of\r\nreal concrete men and women--a proof from history that the world moves\r\nfrom system, through disorder, back again to system.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke showed us, also by the historic method, that given a\r\nfew more years of economic progress on present lines, and we shall\r\nreach, _via_ the Ring and the Trust, that period of “well defined\r\nconfrontation of the rich and poor” upon which German thought has\r\nsettled as the brief stage of sociological evolution immediately\r\npreceding organic change.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this postulate of Teutonic philosophers and economists no\r\none who has given to it a moment’s serious thought is likely to call in\r\nquestion. Nor does anyone who has followed the argument developed in\r\nthese lectures believe that the transition from mitigated individualism\r\nto full collectivity can be made until the capitalist system has worked\r\nitself out to its last logical expression. Till then, no political or\r\nsocial upheaval, however violent, nay, even though the “physical force\r\nrevolutionists” should chase the Guards helter-skelter down Parliament\r\nStreet and the Executive Committee of the Fabian Society hold its\r\nmeetings in the Council Chamber of Windsor Castle, will be anything\r\nmore than one of those “transient riots,” spoken of by Mrs. Besant,\r\nwhich “merely upset thrones and behead monarchs.”[96] All sociologists\r\nI think, all Socialists I am sure, are agreed that until the economic\r\nmoment has arrived, although the hungry or the ignorant may kick up a\r\ndust in Whitechapel and make a bloody puddle in Trafalgar Square, the\r\nSocial Revolution is impossible. But I, for my part, do not believe in\r\nthe even temporary rout of the Household Brigade, nor indeed in any\r\npopular outbreak not easily suppressible by the Metropolitan police;\r\nand I shall waste no time in discussing that solution of the social\r\nproblem of which more was heard in the salad days of the English\r\nSocialist movement--in its pre-Fabian era--than now, _viz._, physical\r\nforce employed by a vigorous few. The physical force man, like the\r\nprivileged Tory, has failed to take note of the flux of things, and\r\nto recognise the change brought about by the ballot. Under a lodger\r\nfranchise the barricade is the last resort of a small and desperate\r\nminority, a frank confession of despair, a reduction to absurdity\r\nof the whole Socialist case. Revolutionary heroics, natural and\r\nunblameable enough in exuberant puerility, are imbecile babblement in\r\nmuscular adolescence, and in manhood would be criminal folly.\r\n\r\nLet us assume then that the present economic progress will continue\r\non its present lines. That machinery will go on replacing hand labor;\r\nthat the joint-stock company will absorb the private firm, to be,\r\nin its turn, swallowed up in the Ring and the Trust. That thus the\r\nsmaller producers and distributors will gradually, but at a constantly\r\nincreasing pace, be squeezed out and reduced to the condition of\r\nemployees of great industrial and trade corporations, managed by highly\r\nskilled captains of industry, in the interests of idle shareholders.\r\n\r\nIn a parliamentarian State like ours, the economic cleavage, which\r\ndivides the proprietors from the propertyless, ever growing wider and\r\nmore clearly defined, must have its analogue in the world of politics.\r\nThe revolution of the last century, which ended in the installation\r\nof the Grand Industry, was the last of the great unconscious world\r\nchanges. It was helped by legislation of course; but the help was\r\nonly of the negative and destructive sort. “Break our fetters and\r\nlet us alone,” was the cry of the revolutionists to Parliament. The\r\nlawmakers, not knowing quite what they were doing, responded, and then\r\nblythely contracted debts, and voted money for commercial wars. Such a\r\nsight will never be seen again. The repeated extension of the suffrage\r\nhas done more than make the industrial masses articulate, it has given\r\nthem consciousness; and for the future the echo of the voices of those\r\nwho suffer from economic changes will be heard clamoring for relief\r\nwithin the walls of St. Stephen’s and the urban guildhalls.\r\n\r\nThus the coming struggle between “haves” and “have nots” will be a\r\nconflict of parties, each perfectly conscious of what it is fighting\r\nabout and fully alive to the life and death importance of the issues at\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nI say “will be”; for one has only to read a few speeches of political\r\nleaders or attend a discussion at a workman’s club to be convinced that\r\nat present it is only the keener and more alert minds on either side\r\nwhich are more than semi-conscious of the true nature of the campaign\r\nof which the first shots may even now be heard at every bye-election.\r\n\r\nBut as nothing makes one so entirely aware of one’s own existence as\r\na sharp spasm of pain; so it is to the suffering--the hunger, the\r\ndespair of to-morrow’s dinner, the anxiety about the next new pair\r\nof trousers--wrought by the increasing economic pressure upon the\r\nenfranchised and educated proletariat that we must look to awaken that\r\nfree self-consciousness which will give the economic changes political\r\nexpression and enable the worker to make practical use of the political\r\nweapons which are his.\r\n\r\nThe outlook then from the point of view of this paper is a political\r\none--one in which we should expect to see the world political gradually\r\nbecoming a reflex of the world economic. That political should be\r\nslow in coming into line with economic facts is only in accordance\r\nwith all that the past history of our country has to teach us. For\r\nyears and decades the squirearchy retained an influence in the House\r\nof Commons out of all proportion to its potency as an economic force;\r\nand even at this moment the “landed interest” bears a much larger\r\npart in law-making than that to which its real importance entitles\r\nit. Therefore we must be neither surprised nor dispirited if, in a\r\ncold-blooded envisagement of the condition of English parties, the\r\ntruth is borne in upon us that the pace of political progress has\r\nno proper relation to the rate at which we are travelling towards\r\nSocialism in the spheres of thought and industry.\r\n\r\nThis fact is probably--nay almost certainly--very much more patent\r\nto the Socialist and the political student than to the man in the\r\nstreet, or even to him of the first class railway carriage. The noisy\r\njubilation of the Radical press over the victory of a Home Ruler\r\nat a bye-election, at a brief and vague reference to the “homes of\r\nthe people” in a two hours’ speech from a Liberal leader, or at the\r\ninsertion of a “social” plank in a new annual programme, is well and\r\ncleverly calculated to beguile the ardent Democrat, and strike cold\r\nterror to the heart of the timorous Tory. But a perfectly impartial\r\nanalysis of the present state of parties will convince the most\r\nsanguine that the breath of the great economic changes dealt with in\r\nMr. Clarke’s paper has as yet scarcely ruffled the surface of the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nWhen the syllabus of this course of lectures was drawn up, those who\r\nwere responsible for it suggested as the first subheading of this\r\npaper, the well worn phrase, “The disappearance of the Whig.” It is a\r\nhappy expression, and one from the contemplation of which much comfort\r\nmay be derived by an optimistic and unanalytical temperament. Printed\r\nare at this disadvantage compared with spoken words, they fail to\r\nconvey the nicer _nuances_ of meaning bestowed by tone and emphasis;\r\nand thus the word “disappearance” meets the eye, carrying with it no\r\nslightest suggestion of irony. Yet the phrase is pointless, if not\r\n“meant surcarstic”; for so far is the Whig from “disappearing,” that\r\nhe is the greatest political fact of the day. To persons deafened\r\nby the daily democratic shouting of the Radical newspapers this\r\nassertion may require some confirmation and support. Let us look at\r\nthe facts then. The first thing which strikes us in connexion with\r\nthe present Parliament is that it no longer consists of two distinct\r\nparties, _i.e._, of two bodies of men differentiated from each other\r\nby the holding of _fundamentally_ different principles. Home Rule\r\nleft out,[97] there remains no reason whatever, except the quite\r\nminor question of Disestablishment, why even the simulacrum of party\r\norganisation should be maintained, or why the structural arrangements\r\nof the House of Commons should not be so altered as to resemble those\r\nof a town hall, in which all the seats face the chair.\r\n\r\nBut fifty years ago the floor of the House was a frontier of genuine\r\nsignificance; and the titles “Whig” and “Tory” were word-symbols of\r\nreal inward and spiritual facts. The Tory party was mostly made up of\r\nmen who were conscientiously opposed to popular representation, and\r\nprepared to stand or fall by their opposition. They held, as a living\r\npolitical creed, that the government of men was the eternal heritage of\r\nthe rich, and especially of those whose riches spelt rent. The Whigs,\r\non the other hand, believed, or said they believed, in the aphorism\r\n“_Vox populi, vox Dei_”; and they, on the whole, consistently advocated\r\nmeasures designed to give that voice a distincter and louder utterance.\r\nHere, then, was one of those fundamental differences in the absence of\r\nwhich party nomenclature is a sham. But there was another. In the first\r\nhalf of this century the Tories, hidebound in historic traditions and\r\ndeaf to the knell of the old _régime_ tolling in the thud, thud, of the\r\npiston rods of the new steam engines, clung pathetically to the old\r\nidea of the functions of the State and to territorial rights. The Whigs\r\nwent for _laisser faire_ and the consequent supremacy of the business\r\nman. I am making a perfectly provable proposition when I say that all\r\nthe political disputes[98] which arose between the Revolution of 1688\r\nand the enfranchisement of the £10 householder by Disraeli had their\r\ncommon cause in one of these two root differences. But the battle has\r\nlong ago been lost and won. The Whigs have triumphed all along the\r\nline. The Tories have not only been beaten, they have been absorbed. A\r\nprocess has gone on like that described by Macaulay as following on the\r\nNorman invasion, when men gradually ceased to call themselves Saxon and\r\nNorman and proudly boasted of being English. The difference in the case\r\nbefore us is that while the Tories have accepted the whole of the Whig\r\nprinciples they still abjure the Whig name.\r\n\r\nNo so-called Conservative to-day will venture on opposing an extension\r\nof the franchise on the plain ground of principle. At most he will but\r\ntemporise and plead for delay. No blush of conscious inconsistency\r\nsuffused Mr. Ritchie’s swarthy features when introducing his “frankly\r\ndemocratic” Local Government Bill. And rightly not; for he was doing no\r\nviolence to party principles.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the functions of the State, the absorption of the Tory\r\nis not quite so obvious, because there never has been, and, as long\r\nas society lasts, never can be, a _parti serieux_ of logical _laisser\r\nfaire_. Even in the thick of the Industrial Revolution, the difference\r\nbetween the two great parties was mainly one of tendency--of attitude\r\nof mind. The Tory had a certain affection for the State--a natural\r\nself-love: the Whig distrusted it. This distrust is now the sentiment\r\nof the whole of our public men. They see, some of them perhaps more\r\nclearly than others, that there is much the State must do; but they all\r\nwish that much to be as little as possible. Even when, driven by an\r\nirresistible force which they feel but do not understand (which none\r\nbut the Socialist does or can understand), they bring forward measures\r\nfor increasing the power of the whole over the part, their arguments\r\nare always suffused in a sickly halo of apology: their gestures are\r\nalways those of timorous deprecation and fretful diffidence. They are\r\nalways nervously anxious to explain that the proposal violates no\r\nprinciple of political economy, and with them political economy means,\r\nnot Professor Sidgwick, but Adam Smith.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this unanimity of all prominent politicians on great\r\nfundamental principles is not manifest to the mind of the average man\r\nis that, although there is nothing left to get hot or even moderately\r\nwarm about, the political temperature is as high as ever. It is not in\r\nthe dust of the arena, but only in the repose of the auditorium that\r\none is able to realise that men will fight as fiercely and clapper-claw\r\neach other as spitefully over a dry bone as over a living principle.\r\nOne has to stand aside awhile to see that politicians are like the\r\ntheological controversialists of whom Professor Seeley somewhere says\r\nthat they never get so angry with each other as when their differences\r\nare almost imperceptible, except perhaps when they are quite so.\r\n\r\nBoth the efficient and the final cause of this unanimity is a\r\nsort of unconscious or semi-conscious recognition of the fact that\r\nthe word “State” has taken to itself new and diverse connotations,\r\nthat the State idea has changed its content. Whatever State control\r\nmay have meant fifty years ago it never meant hostility to private\r\nproperty as such. Now, for us, and for as far ahead as we can see,\r\nit means that and little else. So long as the State interfered with\r\nthe private property and powers of one set of proprietors with a view\r\nonly to increasing those of another, the existence of parties for\r\nand against such interference was a necessity of the case. A duty on\r\nforeign corn meant the keeping up of incomes drawn from rent:[99]\r\nits abolition meant a rise of manufacturers’ profits. “Free Trade”\r\nswelled the purses of the new _bourgeoisie_: the Factory Acts depleted\r\nthem, and gave a sweet revenge to the rent-docked squire. But of this\r\nmanipulation of the legislative machine for proprietors’ purposes we\r\nare at, or at least in sight of, the end. The State has grown bigger\r\nby an immense aggregation of units, who were once to all intents\r\nand purposes separate from it; and now its action generally points\r\nnot to a readjustment of private property and privileges as between\r\nclass and class, but to their complete disappearance. So then the\r\ninstinct which is welding together the propertied politicians is truly\r\nself-preservative.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked by the bewildered Radical, by the tremulous\r\nConservative, by the optimistic Socialist, if the political leaders\r\nare really opposed to State augmentation, how comes it that every new\r\nmeasure of reform introduced into the House of Commons is more or less\r\ncolored with Socialism, and that no popular speaker will venture to\r\naddress a public meeting without making some reference of a socialistic\r\nsort to the social problem? Why, for instance, does that extremely\r\nwell oiled and accurately poised political weathercock, Sir William\r\nHarcourt, pointing to the dawn, crow out that “we are all Socialists\r\nnow”?\r\n\r\nTo these questions (and I have not invented them) I answer: in the\r\nfirst place because the opposition of the political leaders _is_\r\ninstinctive, and only, as yet, semi-conscious, even in the most\r\nhypocritical; in the second place, that a good deal of the legislative\r\nSocialism appears more in words than in deeds; in the third place that\r\nthe famous flourish of Sir William Harcourt was a rhetorical falsehood;\r\nand fourthly, because, fortunately for the progress of mankind,\r\nself-preservative instincts are not peculiar to the propertied classes.\r\n\r\nFor it is largely instinctive and wholly self preservative, this change\r\nin the position of the working people towards the State, this change by\r\nwhich, from fearing it as an actual enemy, they have come to look to\r\nit as a potential savior. I know that this assertion will be violently\r\ndenied by many of my Socialist brethren. The fly on the wheel, not\r\nunnaturally, feels wounded at being told that he is, after all, not the\r\nmotive power; and the igniferous orators of the Socialist party are\r\nwelcome, so far as I am concerned, to all the comfort they can get from\r\nimagining that they, and not any great, blind, evolutionary forces are\r\nthe dynamic of the social revolution. Besides, the metaphor of the fly\r\nreally does not run on all fours (I forget, for the moment, how many\r\nlegs a fly has); for the Socialist does at least know in what direction\r\nthe car is going, even though he is not the driving force. Yet it seems\r\nto me the part being, and to be, played by the Socialist, is notable\r\nenough in all conscience; for it is he who is turning instinct into\r\nself-conscious reason; voicing a dumb demand; and giving intelligent\r\ndirection to a thought wave of terrific potency.\r\n\r\nThere is a true cleavage being slowly driven through the body politic;\r\nbut the wedge is still beneath the surface. The signs of its workings\r\nare to be found in the reactionary measures of pseudo reform advocated\r\nby many prominent politicians; in the really Socialist proposals of\r\nsome of the obscurer men; in the growing distaste of the political club\r\nman for a purely political pabulum; and in the receptive attitude of a\r\ncertain portion of the cultivated middle class towards the outpourings\r\nof the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nThis conscious recognition of the meaning of modern tendencies, this\r\ndefining of the new line of cleavage, while it is the well-spring of\r\nmost of the Socialist hopes, is no less the source of some lively fear.\r\nAt present it is only the acuter and more far seeing of the minds\r\namongst the propertied classes who are at all alive to the real nature\r\nof the attack. One has but to listen to the chatter of the average\r\nLiberal candidate, to note how hopelessly blind the man is to the fact\r\nthat the existence of private property in the means of production,\r\nforms any factor at all in the social problem; and what is true of the\r\nrank and file is true only in a less degree of the chiefs themselves.\r\nIgnorance of economics and inability to shake their minds free of\r\neighteenth century political philosophy,[100] at present hinders the\r\nleaders of the “party of progress” from taking up a definite position\r\neither for or against the advance of the new ideas. The number of\r\nEnglish statesmen, who, like Prince Bismarck, see in Socialism a\r\nswelling tide whose oceanic rush must be broken by timely legislative\r\nbreakwaters, is still only to be expressed by a minus quantity. But\r\nthis political myopia is not destined to endure. Every additional\r\nvote cast for avowed Socialist candidates at municipal and other\r\nelections, will help to bring home to the minds of the Liberals, that\r\nthe section of the new democracy which regards the ballot merely as a\r\nwar-engine with which to attack capitalism, is a growing one. At last\r\nour Liberal will be face to face with a logical but irritating choice.\r\nEither to throw over private capital or to frankly acknowledge that\r\nit is a distinction without a difference which separates him from the\r\nConservatives, against whom he has for years been fulminating.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it looks as though this political moment in the history\r\nof the Liberal party would be one eminently auspicious for the\r\nSocialist cause. But although I have a lively faith in the victory of\r\nlogic in the long run, I have an equally vivid knowledge that to assure\r\nthe triumph the run must be a very long one; and above all I have a\r\nprofound respect for the staying powers of politicians, and their\r\nability to play a waiting game. It is one thing to offer a statesman\r\nthe choice of one of two logical courses: it is another to prevent his\r\nseeing a third, and an illogical one, and going for it. Such prevention\r\nin the present case will be so difficult as to be well nigh impossible;\r\nfor the Liberal hand still holds a strong suit--the cards political.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that the social programme of our party will\r\nbecome a great fact long before all the purely political proposals\r\nof the Liberals have received the Royal assent; and the game of the\r\npolitician will be to hinder the adoption of the former by noisily\r\nhustling forward the latter. Unfortunately for us it will be an\r\neasy enough game to play. The scent of the non-Socialist politician\r\nfor political red herrings is keen, and his appetite for political\r\nDead Sea fruit prodigious. The number of “blessed words,” the mere\r\nsound of which carries content to his soul, would fill a whole page.\r\nIn an age of self-seeking his pathetic self-abnegation would be\r\nrefreshing were it not so desperately silly. The young artizan on\r\nfive-and-twenty shillings a week, who with his wife and children\r\noccupies two rooms in “a model,” and who is about as likely to become\r\na Lama as a leaseholder, will shout himself hoarse over Leaseholds’\r\nEnfranchisement, and sweat great drops of indignation at the plunder\r\nof rich West End tradesmen by rich West End landlords. The “out of\r\nwork,” whose last shirt is in pawn, will risk his skull’s integrity in\r\nTrafalgar Square in defence of Mr. O’Brien’s claim to dress in gaol\r\nlike a gentleman.\r\n\r\nOf course all this is very touching: indeed, to be quite serious, it\r\nindicates a nobility of character and breadth of human sympathy in\r\nwhich lies our hope of social salvation. But its infinite potentiality\r\nmust not blind us to the fact that in its actuality the dodgy Liberal\r\nwill see his chance of the indefinite postponement of the socialising\r\nof politics. Manhood suffrage, female suffrage, the woes of deceased\r\nwives’ sisters, the social ambition of dissenting ministers, the legal\r\nobstacles to the “free” acquirement of landed property, home rule\r\nfor “dear old Scotland” and “neglected little Wales,” extraordinary\r\ntithes, reform of the House of Lords: all these and any number of other\r\nobstacles may be successfully thrown in the way of the forward march\r\nof the Socialist army. And the worst of it all is that in a great part\r\nof his obstructive tactics the Liberal will have us on the hip; for\r\nto out-and-out democratisation we are fully pledged, and must needs\r\nback up any attack on hereditary or class privilege, come it from what\r\nquarter it may.\r\n\r\nBut, to get back to our metaphor of the card table (a metaphor much\r\nmore applicable to the games of political men), the political suit does\r\nnot exhaust the Liberal hand. There still remains a card to play--a\r\nveritable trump. Sham Socialism is the name of it, and Mr. John Morley\r\nthe man to plank it down.\r\n\r\nI have said above that the trend of things to Socialism is best\r\nshewn by the changed attitude of men towards State interference\r\nand control; and this is true. Still it must not be forgotten that\r\nalthough Socialism involves State control, State control does not imply\r\nSocialism--at least in any modern meaning of the term. It is not so\r\nmuch to the thing the State does, as to the end for which it does it\r\nthat we must look before we can decide whether it is a Socialist State\r\nor not. Socialism is the common holding of the means of production\r\nand exchange, and _the holding of them for the equal benefit of all_.\r\nIn view of the tone now being adopted by some of us[101] I cannot too\r\nstrongly insist upon the importance of this distinction; for the losing\r\nsight of it by friends, and its intentional obscuration by enemies,\r\nconstitute a big and immediate danger. To bring forward sixpenny\r\ntelegrams as an instance of State Socialism may be a very good method\r\nof scoring a point off an individualist opponent in a debate before\r\na middle-class audience; but from the standpoint of the proletariat\r\na piece of State management which spares the pockets only of the\r\ncommercial and leisured classes is no more Socialism than were the\r\n_droits de Seigneur_ of the middle ages. Yet this is the sort of sham\r\nSocialism which it is as certain as death will be doled out by the\r\npopular party in the hope that mere State action will be mistaken for\r\nreally Socialist legislation. And the object of these givers of Greek\r\ngifts will most infallibly be attained if those Socialists who know\r\nwhat they want hesitate (from fear of losing popularity, or from any\r\nmore amiable weakness) to clamor their loudest against any and every\r\nproposal whose adoption would prolong the life of private capital a\r\nsingle hour.\r\n\r\nBut leaving sham Socialism altogether out of account, there are other\r\nplanks in the Liberal “and Radical” programme which would make stubborn\r\nbarriers in the paths of the destroyers of private capital. Should, for\r\ninstance, Church disestablishment come upon us while the _personnel_ of\r\nthe House of Commons is at all like what it is at present, few things\r\nare more certain than that a good deal of what is now essentially\r\ncollective property will pass into private hands; that the number of\r\nindividuals interested in upholding ownership will be increased; and\r\nthat the only feelings gratified will be the acquisitiveness of these\r\npersons and the envy of Little Bethel.\r\n\r\nAgain, the general state of mind of the Radical on the land question\r\nis hardly such as to make a Socialist hilarious. It is true your\r\n“progressive” will cheer Henry George, and is sympathetically inclined\r\nto nationalisation (itself a “blessed word”); but he is not at all sure\r\nthat nationalisation, free land, and peasant proprietorship, are not\r\nthree names for one and the same proposal. And, so far as the effective\r\nmembers of the Liberal party are concerned, there is no question at\r\nall that the second and third of these “solutions” find much more\r\nfavor than the first. In fact, in this matter of the land, the method\r\nof dealing with which is of the very propædeutics of Socialism, the\r\nRadical who goes for “free sale” or for peasant ownership, is a less\r\npotent revolutionary force than the Tory himself; for this latter only\r\nseeks to maintain in land the state of things which the Ring and Trust\r\nmaker is working to bring about in capital[102]--and on the part which\r\n_he_ is playing in economic evolution we are all agreed.\r\n\r\nFrom such dangers as these the progress of Democracy is, by itself,\r\npowerless to save us; for although always and everywhere Democracy\r\nholds Socialism in its womb, the birth may be indefinitely delayed by\r\nstupidity on one side and acuteness on the other.\r\n\r\nI have gone at some length into an analysis of the possible artificial\r\nhindrances to Socialism, because, owing to the amiability and\r\npoliteness shown us by the Radical left wing during the last twelve\r\nmonths; to the successes which Radical votes have given to some of our\r\ncandidates at School Board and other elections; and to the friendly\r\npatronage bestowed upon us by certain “advanced” journals, some of our\r\nbrightest, and otherwise most clear-sighted, spirits have begun to base\r\nhigh hopes upon what they call “the permeation” of the Liberal party.\r\nThese of our brothers have a way of telling us that the transition to\r\nSocialism will be so gradual as to be imperceptible, and that there\r\nwill never come a day when we shall be able to say “now we have a\r\nSocialist State.” They are fond of likening the simpler among us who\r\ndisagree with them as to the extreme protraction of the process, to\r\nchildren who having been told that when it rains a cloud falls, looks\r\ndisappointedly out of the window on a wet day, unconscious that the\r\ncloud is falling before their eyes in the shape of drops of water. To\r\nthese cautious souls I reply that although there is much truth in their\r\ncontention that the process will be gradual, we shall be able to say\r\nthat we have a Socialist State on the day on which no man or group of\r\nmen holds, over the means of production, property rights by which the\r\nlabor of the producers can be subjected to exploitation; and that while\r\ntheir picturesque metaphor is a happy as well as a poetic conceit, it\r\ndepends upon the political acumen of the present and next generation of\r\nSocialist men whether the “cloud” shall fall in refreshing Socialist\r\nshowers or in a dreary drizzle of Radicalism, bringing with it more\r\nsmuts than water, fouling everything and cleansing nowhere.\r\n\r\nThis permeation of the Radical Left, undoubted fact though it is of\r\npresent day politics, is worth a little further attention; for there\r\nare two possible and tenable views as to its final outcome. One is\r\nthat it will end in the slow absorption of the Socialist in the\r\nLiberal party, and that by the action of this sponge-like organism,\r\nthe whole of the Rent and Interest will pass into collective control,\r\nwithout there ever having been a party definitely and openly pledged\r\nto that end. According to this theory there will come a time, and that\r\nshortly, when the avowed Socialists and the much socialised Radicals\r\nwill be strong enough to hold the balance in many constituencies, and\r\nsufficiently powerful in all to drive the advanced candidate many\r\npegs further than his own inclination would take him. Then, either\r\nby abstention or by actual support of the reactionary champion at\r\nelections, they will be able to threaten the Liberals with certain\r\ndefeat. The Liberals, being traditionally squeezable folk (like all\r\nabsorbent bodies), will thus be forced to make concessions and to\r\noffer compromises; and will either adopt a certain minimum number of\r\nthe Socialis_tic_ proposals, or allow to Socialists a share in the\r\nrepresentation itself. Such concessions and compromises will grow in\r\nnumber and importance with each successive appeal to the electorate,\r\nuntil at last the game is won.\r\n\r\nNow it seems to me that these hopefuls allow their desires to distort\r\ntheir reason. The personal equation plays too large a part in the\r\nprophecy. They are generally either not yet wholly socialised Radicals\r\nor Socialists who have quite recently broken away from mere political\r\nRadicalism, and are still largely under the influence of party ties\r\nand traditions. They find it almost impossible to believe that the\r\nparty with which they acted so long, so conscientiously, and with\r\nso much satisfaction to themselves, is, after all, not the party to\r\nwhich belongs the future. They are in many cases on terms of intimate\r\nprivate friendship with some of the lesser lights of Radicalism, and\r\noccasionally bask in the patronizing radiance shed by the larger\r\nluminaries. A certain portion of the “advanced” press is open to\r\nthem for the expression of their views political. Of course none of\r\nthese considerations are at all to their discredit, or reflect in\r\nthe very least upon their motives or sincerity; but they do color\r\ntheir judgment and cause them to reckon without their host. They are\r\na little apt to forget that a good deal of the democratic programme\r\nhas yet (as I have said above) to be carried. Manhood suffrage, the\r\nabolition of the Lords, disestablishment, the payment of members:\r\nall these may be, and are, quite logically desired by men who cling\r\nas pertinaciously to private capital as the doughtiest knight of the\r\nPrimrose League. Such men regard the vital articles of the Socialist\r\ncreed as lying altogether outside the concrete world--“the sphere of\r\npractical politics.” Meanwhile the Socialist votes and voices are well\r\nwithin that sphere; and it is every day becoming more evident that\r\nwithout them the above-mentioned aspirations have a meagre chance of\r\nrealisation. Now, from the eminently business-like Liberal stand-point,\r\nthere is no reason whatever why concessions should not be made to the\r\nSocialist at the polling booth so long as none are asked for in the\r\nHouse of Commons. And even when they are demanded, what easier than to\r\nmake some burning political question play the part which Home Rule is\r\nplaying now? Thus an endless vista of office opens before the glowing\r\neyes of the practical politician, those short-sighted eyes which see so\r\nlittle beyond the nose, and which, at that distance only, enable their\r\nowner to hit the white.\r\n\r\nThe Radical is right as usual in counting on the Socialist alliance\r\nup to a certain point. For us the complete democratisation of\r\ninstitutions is a political necessity. But long before that complete\r\ndemocratisation has been brought about, we shall have lost our patience\r\nand the Radicals their temper.\r\n\r\nFor as Mr. Hyndman tells the world with damnable (but most veracious)\r\niteration, we are “a growing party.” We recruit by driblets; but we\r\ndo recruit; and those who come to us come, like all the new American\r\nnewspapers, “to stay.” Our _faith_, our reason, our knowledge, tell\r\nus that the great evolutionary forces are with us; and every addition\r\nto our ranks causes us, in geometrical proportion, to be less and\r\nless tolerant of political prevarication. Directly we feel ourselves\r\nstrong enough to have the slightest chance of winning off our own bat,\r\nwe shall be compelled both by principle and inclination to send an\r\neleven to the wickets. They will have to face the opposition, united or\r\ndisunited, of both the orthodox parties, as did the defeated Socialist\r\ncandidates at the School Board election in November, 1888. And whether\r\nour success be great or small, or even non-existent, we shall be\r\ndenounced by the Radical wire-pullers and the now so complaisant and\r\ncourteous Radical press. The alliance will be at an end.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another way in which we may win the ill-will of our\r\ntemporary allies and, at present, very good friends. I have spoken\r\nabove of certain reactionary items of a possible Radical programme,\r\nwhich, although they have a grotesque resemblance to Socialism, are\r\nworlds away from being the thing itself. These proposals we not only\r\ncannot support, but must and shall actively and fiercely oppose. At the\r\nfirst signs of such opposition to whoever may be the Liberal shepherd\r\nof the moment, the whole flock of party sheep will be in full cry upon\r\nour track. The ferocity of the _mouton enragé_ is proverbial; and we\r\nshall be treated to the same rancour, spleen, and bile which is now so\r\nplenteously meted out to the Liberal Unionists.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of this inevitable split will be the formation\r\nof a definitely Socialist party, _i.e._, a party pledged to the\r\ncommunalisation of all the means of production and exchange, and\r\nprepared to subordinate every other consideration to that one end. Then\r\nthe House of Commons will begin dimly to reflect the real condition of\r\nthe nation outside; and in it we shall see as in a glass, darkly, or\r\nsmudgedly, something of that “well defined confrontation of rich and\r\npoor,” of which all who attend Socialist lectures hear so much, and to\r\nwhich _ex hypothesi_, the world, day by day, draws nearer. Then, also,\r\nwill begin that process which, I submit, is more likely than either the\r\nabsorption of the Socialist or the prolonged permeation of the Radical:\r\nnamely, the absorption of the Radical himself into the definitely\r\npro-private capital party on the one side, and the definitely\r\nanti-private capital party on the other.\r\n\r\nA really homogeneous Socialist party once formed, the world political\r\nreflects the world economic, and there is no longer any room for the\r\nRadical, as we know the wonder. Each fresh Socialist victory, each\r\noutpost driven in, each entrenchment carried, will be followed by a\r\nwarren-like scuttle of alarmed and well-to-do Radicals across the floor\r\nof the House of Commons, which will once more become a true frontier;\r\nand, finally, the political battle array will consist of a small\r\nopposition, fronting a great and powerful majority, made up of all\r\nthose whose real or fancied interests would suffer from expropriation.\r\n\r\nThus far the outlook has been clear and focusable enough; and it has\r\nneeded no extra-human illumination to see the details. All that has\r\nbeen wanted has been normal vision and a mind fairly free of the\r\nidols of the cave. But here the prospect becomes dim and uncertain;\r\nand little purpose would be served by trying to pierce the mist which\r\nenshrouds the distant future.\r\n\r\nMuch, very much, will depend upon the courage, the magnanimity,\r\nthe steadfastness, the tact, the foresight, and above all upon the\r\nincorruptibility of those whose high mission it will be to frame the\r\npolicy and direct the strategy of the Socialist party in those early\r\ndays of its parliamentary life. It will have sore need of a leader as\r\nable as, and more conscientious than, any of the great parliamentary\r\nfigures of the past. The eye expectant searches in vain for such a man\r\nnow among the younger broods of the new democracy. He is probably at\r\nthis moment in his cradle or equitably sharing out toys or lollipops\r\nto his comrades of the nursery. And this is well; for he must be a man\r\nquit of all recollections of these days of _Sturm und Drang_, of petty\r\njealousies, constant errors, and failing faith. He must bring to his\r\ntask a record free from failure and without suspicion of stain.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the difficulties in store for us who name the name\r\nof Socialism, of one thing at least they who have followed this course\r\nof lectures may make quite sure. That, however long and wearisome the\r\nstruggle, each day brings us nearer victory. Those who resist Socialism\r\nfight against principalities and powers in economic places. Every new\r\nindustrial development will add point to our arguments and soldiers\r\nto our ranks. The continuous perfecting of the organisation of labour\r\nwill hourly quicken in the worker the consciousness that his is a\r\ncollective, not an individual life. The proletariat is even now the\r\nonly real class: its units are the only human beings who have nothing\r\nto hope for save from the levelling up of the aggregate of which they\r\nform a part. The intensifying of the struggle for existence, while\r\nit sets _bourgeois_ at the throat of _bourgeois_, is forcing union\r\nand solidarity upon the workers. And the _bourgeois_ ranks themselves\r\nare dwindling. The keenness of competition, making it every year more\r\nobviously impossible for those who are born without capital ever to\r\nachieve it, will deprive the capitalist class of the support it now\r\nreceives from educated and cultivated but impecunious young men whose\r\nmaterial interest must finally triumph over their class sympathies; and\r\nfrom that section of workmen whose sole aspiration is to struggle out\r\nof the crowd. The rising generation of wage workers, instead of as now\r\nbeing befogged and bedevilled by the dust and smoke of mere faction\r\nfight, will be able at a glance to distinguish the uniforms of friend\r\nand foe. Despair will take sides with Hope in doing battle for the\r\nSocialist cause.\r\n\r\nThese lectures have made it plain enough to those who have hearing\r\nears and understanding brains that mere material self-interest alone\r\nwill furnish a motive strong enough to shatter monopoly; and after\r\nmonopoly comes Socialism or--chaos. But the interest of the smaller\r\nself is not the only force which aids us in the present, or will guide\r\nus in the future. The angels are on our side. The constant presence\r\nof a vast mass of human misery is generating in the educated classes\r\na deep discontent, a spiritual unrest, which drives the lower types\r\nto pessimism, the higher to enquiry. Pessimism paralyses the arms and\r\nunnerves the hearts of those who would be against us. Enquiry proves\r\nthat Socialism is founded upon a triple rock, historical, ethical, and\r\neconomic. It gives, to those who make it, a great hope--a hope which,\r\nonce it finds entrance into the heart of man, stays to soften life\r\nand sweeten death. By the light of the Socialist Ideal he sees the\r\nevil--yet sees it pass. Then and now he begins to live in the cleaner,\r\nbraver, holier life of the future; and he marches forward, steeled and\r\nstimulated, with resolute step, with steadfast eye, with equal pulse.\r\n\r\nIt is just when the storm winds blow and the clouds lour and the\r\nhorizon is at its blackest that the ideal of the Socialist shines with\r\ndivinest radiance, bidding him trust the inspiration of the poet rather\r\nthan heed the mutterings of the perplexed politician, bidding him\r\nbelieve that\r\n\r\n  “For a’ that, for a’ that,\r\n  Its coming yet for a’ that,\r\n  That man to man the world o’er\r\n  Shall brothers be for a’ that.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] It is to the half-conscious recognition of this generalisation\r\nthat the disappearance of militant Republicanism among the English\r\nworking classes is owing.\r\n\r\n[97] The difference of principle here is more apparent than real. The\r\nGladstonians repudiate any desire for separation, and affirm their\r\nintention of maintaining the absolute veto of the imperial Parliament;\r\nwhile the Unionists avow their ultimate intention of giving to Ireland\r\nthe same powers of self-government now enjoyed, or to be enjoyed by\r\nEngland and Scotland.\r\n\r\n[98] The battles for Catholic Emancipation and the removal of the\r\nreligious disabilities were fought on sectarian rather than on\r\npolitical grounds.\r\n\r\n[99] This is perhaps not, historically, quite true; but the landlords\r\nbelieved that their own prosperity depended upon the exclusion of\r\nforeign corn, and that is sufficient for the purpose of my argument.\r\n\r\n[100] _Cf._ The speeches of Mr. John Morley on the eight hours’\r\nproposal and the taxation of ground rents. Also the recent writings of\r\nMr. Bradlaugh, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[101] One of the most indefatigable and prolific members of the\r\nSocialist party, in a widely circulated tract, has actually adduced the\r\nexistence of _hawkers’ licenses_ as an instance of the “Progress of\r\nSocialism”!\r\n\r\n[102] It is worth noting that those organs of the press which are\r\ndevoted more particularly to the landed interest have been the first to\r\nhint at the probable desirability of dealing with great _industrial_\r\nmonopolies by means of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Absentee Proprietors, 22\r\n\r\n  Abstinence, Reward of, 17\r\n\r\n  Abstract method in Economics, 21\r\n\r\n  Administrative Errors, 37\r\n\r\n  “Administrative Nihilism”, 38\r\n\r\n  Adulteration Acts, 41\r\n\r\n  Aged, Treatment of the, 150\r\n\r\n  Agriculture and Machinery, 62\r\n\r\n  Aladdin’s uncle outdone, 9\r\n\r\n  Aliens, Necessity under Socialism for a law of, 125\r\n\r\n  Althorp, Lord, 69\r\n\r\n  America (See UNITED STATES).\r\n\r\n  American Independence, Declaration of, 60\r\n\r\n  Anarchists, Modern, 160\r\n\r\n  Anarchy preferred to corrupt State regulation by progressive thinkers,\r\n   160\r\n\r\n  Andrews, E.
