but the reverse was the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between Congress and the King of France was kept in\r\nabeyance by the latter during more than a twelvemonth after it was\r\napplied for by the agents of Congress, until after the defeat and\r\ncapture of General Burgoyne and the refusal of Congress to confer with\r\nLord and General Howe, as British Commissioners, without the previous\r\nacknowledgment by the Commissioners of the independence of the United\r\nStates.[1]\r\n\r\nLord Admiral Howe, having spent some months with his fleet at Halifax,\r\ndid not arrive at Sandy Hook until the 12th of July, eight days after\r\nthe Declaration of Independence. \"Besides the troops, Lord Howe had\r\nbrought with him a document which it was hoped might render them\r\nunnecessary--the Royal warrant appointing himself and General Howe\r\nCommissioners under the Act of Parliament for the pacification of\r\nAmerica. No doubt the selection of such men was most wisely made. The\r\nmemory of their elder brother, who had fallen gloriously in the wars\r\nagainst the French in Canada, was endeared to the colonists, who had\r\nfought by his side. Both Lord Howe and the General, but Lord Howe\r\nespecially, had ever since cultivated a friendly intercourse with\r\nAmericans, and now entertained a most earnest wish to conclude the\r\nstrife against them. But judicious as was the choice of the\r\nCommissioners, the restricted terms of the Commission were certainly in\r\nthe highest degree impolitic. Lord Howe had laboured, but vainly, to\r\nobtain its enlargement; it amounted, in fact, to little more than the\r\npower, first, of receiving submissions, and then, but not till then, of\r\ngranting pardons and inquiring into grievances.[2] Yet, still, since\r\nthese terms had not been divulged, and were much magnified by common\r\nrumour, the name of the Commission was not ill adapted for popular\r\neffect. Had Lord Howe arrived with it a few weeks before, as he might\r\nand should have done, we are assured by American writers that an\r\nimpression might have been produced by it, in some at least of the\r\nthirteen colonies, to an extent which they 'cannot calculate,' or\r\nrather, perhaps, which they do not like to own. But these few months had\r\nbeen decisive in another direction. During these months both the feeling\r\nand the position of the insurgents had most materially changed.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\"The two Royal Commissioners,\" says Dr. Ramsay, \"Admiral and General\r\nHowe, thought proper, before they commenced their military operations,\r\nto try what might be done in their civil capacity towards effecting a\r\nreunion between Great Britain and the colonies. It was one of the first\r\nacts of Lord Howe to send on shore a circular letter to several of the\r\nRoyal Governors in America, informing them of the late Act of Parliament\r\n'for restoring peace to the colonies, and granting pardon to such as\r\nshould deserve mercy,' and desiring them to publish a declaration which\r\naccompanied the same. In this, he informed the colonists of the power\r\nwith which his brother and he were entrusted 'of granting general or\r\nparticular pardons to all those who, though they had deviated from their\r\nallegiance, were willing to return to their duty:' and of declaring 'any\r\ncolony, province, county or town, port, district or place, to be in the\r\npeace of his Majesty.' Congress, impressed with the belief that the\r\nproposals of the Commissioners, instead of disuniting the people, would\r\nhave a contrary effect, ordered them to be speedily published in the\r\nseveral American newspapers. Had a _redress of grievances_ been at this\r\nlate hour offered, though the honour of the States was involved in\r\nsupporting their late Declaration of Independence, yet the love of\r\npeace, and the bias of great numbers to their parent State, would, in\r\nall probability, have made a powerful party for rescinding the Act of\r\nSeparation, and for re-uniting with Great Britain; but when it appeared\r\nthat the power of the Royal Commissioners was little more than to grant\r\npardons, Congress appealed to the good sense of the people for the\r\nnecessity of adhering to the Act of Independence.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIt was a diplomatic blunder and an unwise policy for the English\r\nCommissioners to make known to the public the restricted authority of\r\ntheir commission, instead of simply stating in general terms their\r\ncommission under the authority of the Act of Parliament \"for restoring\r\npeace to the colonies.\" On such grounds and for such an object the\r\nCongress could have offered no justifiable excuse for refusing a\r\nconference with the Royal Commissioners; and when, in the course of the\r\ndiscussion, it should have been found that the Commissioners could not\r\nagree with, and did not feel themselves authorized to accede to, all\r\nthe demands of the agents of Congress, the Royal Commissioners (both of\r\nwhom were known to be friends of the colonies, and opposed to the\r\nhigh-handed measures of the Parliament) could have noted the points of\r\ndifference, and agreed to recommend the demands made upon them to the\r\nmost favourable consideration of the King's Government: at all events,\r\nfriendly intercourse and negotiations would have been opened which would\r\nhave been probably followed by a suspension of hostilities, if not\r\ncomplete reconciliation. But this was what Congress, led by John Adams\r\nand Dr. Franklin--bitter enemies to reconciliation--dreaded; and they\r\nvery shrewdly saw and improved the imprudent exposure of the Royal\r\nCommissioners, by directing the publication of their circular letter and\r\ndeclaration in all the provincial newspapers, \"that the good people of\r\nthe United States may be informed of what nature are the Commissioners,\r\nand what the terms, with expectation of which the insidious Court of\r\nGreat Britain had endeavoured to amuse and disarm them; and that the few\r\nwho still remain suspended by a hope, founded either on the justice or\r\nmoderation of their late King, might now at length be convinced that the\r\nvalour alone of their country is to save its liberties.\"\r\n\r\nThus all conference with the Royal Commissioners was refused on the part\r\nof the leaders in Congress; war and bloodshed followed, and a year of\r\ndisastrous defeats to the Revolutionists; but the position of the\r\nLoyalists may be inferred from the resolution of the New York\r\nRevolutionary Convention, adopted a few days after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and before the actual commencement of hostilities, and\r\nwhich was as follows: \"That all persons residing within the State of New\r\nYork, and claiming protection from its laws, owed it allegiance; and\r\nthat any person owing it allegiance, and levying war against the State,\r\n_or being an adherent to the King of Great Britain, should be deemed\r\nguilty of treason and suffer death_.\" The Convention also resolved:\r\n\"That as the inhabitants of King's County had determined not to oppose\r\nthe enemy, a Committee should be appointed to inquire into the\r\nauthenticity of these reports, and to _disarm and secure the\r\ndisaffected, to remove or destroy the stock of grain, and, if necessary,\r\nto lay the whole county waste_.\" Such treatment of adherents to the\r\nunity of the empire, and of even neutrals, at the very commencement of\r\nthe war, goes far to account for the warfare of extermination in many\r\nplaces between the two parties in subsequent years. This mode of warfare\r\nwas first instituted against the Loyalists, who acted on the defensive,\r\nand who have been loudly complained of by American historians for having\r\nafterwards, and on some occasions cruelly retaliated upon those who had\r\ndriven them to desperation.\r\n\r\nA little more than eighteen months after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, 17th of February, 1778, three Bills were introduced into\r\nand passed by the British Parliament, which entirely removed all the\r\ngrounds of complaint made by the colonists in previous years, and\r\nprovided for the appointment of Commissioners to settle all differences\r\nbetween the colonies and the mother country. The first of these Bills\r\nwas entitled, \"For removing Doubts and Apprehensions concerning Taxation\r\nby the Parliament of Great Britain in any of the Colonies.\" It expressly\r\nrepealed by name the tea duty in America, and declared: \"That from and\r\nafter the passing of this Act the King and Parliament of Great Britain\r\nwill not impose any duty, tax, or assessment whatever in any of his\r\nMajesty's (American) colonies, except only such duties as it may be\r\nexpedient to impose for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of\r\nsuch duties to be always paid and applied to and for the use of the\r\ncolony in which the same shall be levied.\" \"Thus,\" says Lord Mahon, \"was\r\nthe claim of parliamentary taxation fully, at last, renounced.\"\r\n\r\nThe second Bill was \"To enable his Majesty to appoint Commissioners with\r\nsufficient power to treat, consult, and agree upon the means of quieting\r\nthe disorders now subsisting in certain of the colonies, plantations,\r\nand provinces of North America.\" The Commissioners were to be five in\r\nnumber, and were invested with extensive powers; they were to raise no\r\ndifficulties as to the rank or title of the leaders on either side, but\r\nwere left at liberty to treat, consult, and agree with any body or\r\nbodies politic, or any person or persons whatsoever; they might proclaim\r\na cessation of hostilities on the part of the King's forces by sea or\r\nland, for any time, or under any conditions or restrictions; they might\r\nsuspend any Act of Parliament relating to America passed since the 10th\r\nof February, 1763. In short, it was intimated that the Commissioners\r\nmight accept almost any terms of reconciliation short of independence,\r\nand subject to be confirmed by a vote of Parliament.\r\n\r\nLord North introduced his Bills in an able and eloquent speech of two\r\nhours, in which he reviewed his own career and the several questions of\r\ndispute with the colonies.[5]\r\n\r\nBut though taunted from all sides, his Bills passed speedily through\r\nboth Houses of Parliament. Lord Mahon remarks: \"In spite of such taunts\r\nand far from friendly feelings on all sides, the Conciliatory Bills, as\r\nthey have been termed, were not in reality opposed from any quarter.\r\nThere was only one division on a clause moved by Mr. Powys, to repeal\r\nexpressly by name the Massachusetts Charter Act. Lord North induced a\r\nlarge majority to vote against that clause, but agreed that the object\r\nin view should be attained by a separate measure. A Bill for that\r\npurpose was therefore introduced by Mr. Powys, and passed through\r\nParliament concurrently with the other two. In the House of Lords the\r\nsame arguments were, with little change, renewed. Lord Shelburne took\r\noccasion to declare his full concurrence in the sentiments of Lord\r\nChatham, expressing 'the strongest disapprobation of every idea tending\r\nto admit the independence of America,' although acknowledging that\r\nfuture circumstances might create a necessity for such a submission.\r\nLord Chatham himself was ill with gout at Hayes, and did not appear.\r\nThere was no division; and on the 11th of March (1778), the King, seated\r\non his throne, gave to all three measures the royal assent.\"[6]\r\n\r\nLord North and other members of his Administration were convinced that\r\nthe American problem could not be solved by their own party; that such a\r\nwork could be accomplished by the Earl of Chatham alone, as he had a few\r\nyears before, by his skill and energy, when the affairs of America were\r\nin a desperate state after five years' unsuccessful war with France,\r\ndispossessed France, in the short space of two years, of every inch of\r\nAmerican territory. The Duke of Richmond advocated immediate surrender\r\nof independence to the Americans, and peace with them, in order to avoid\r\na war with France; he doubted the possibility of even Lord Chatham being\r\nable to effect a reconciliation between the American colonies and Great\r\nBritain. Three-fourths of a century afterwards, Lord Macaulay expressed\r\nthe same opinion; but Lord Mahon, in his History, has expressed a\r\ncontrary opinion, and given his reasons in the following words, well\r\nworthy of being carefully read and pondered:\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, let it be remembered with what great and what\r\nsingular advantages Lord Chatham would have set his hand to the work. He\r\nhad from the outset most ably and most warmly supported the claims of\r\nthe colonists. Some of his eloquent sentences had become watchwords in\r\ntheir mouths. His statue had been erected in their streets; his\r\nportrait was hanging in their Council Chambers. For his great name they\r\nfelt a love and reverence higher as yet than for any one of their own\r\nchiefs and leaders, not even at that early period excepting Washington\r\nhimself. Thus, if even it could be said that overtures of reconciliation\r\nhad failed in every other British hand, it would afford no proof that in\r\nChatham's they might not have thriven and borne fruit.\r\n\r\n\"But what at the same period was the position of Congress? Had that\r\nassembly shown of late an enlightened zeal for the public interests, and\r\ndid it then stand high in the confidence and affection of its\r\ncountrymen? Far otherwise. The factions and divisions prevailing at\r\ntheir town of York (in Virginia, where they removed from Baltimore), the\r\nvindictive rigour to political opponents, the neglect of Washington's\r\narmy, and the cabals against Washington's powers, combined to create\r\ndisgust, with other less avoidable causes, as the growing depreciation\r\nof the paper-money, the ruinous loss of trade, and the augmented burdens\r\nof the war. Is the truth of this picture denied? Hear then, as\r\nwitnesses, the members of Congress themselves. We find in this very\r\nmonth of March (1778), one of them write to another on the necessity of\r\njoint exertions to \"revive the expiring reputation of Congress.\" (Letter\r\nfrom William Duer, of New York, to Robert Morris, dated March 6th, 1778,\r\nand printed in the Life of Reed, Vol. I., p. 365.) We find another\r\nlamenting that 'even good Whigs begin to think peace, at some expense,\r\ndesirable.' (General Reed to President Wharton, February 1, 1778.)\r\n\r\n\"When such was the feeling in America, both as regarded Lord Chatham and\r\nas regarded the Congress, it would not certainly follow that any\r\noverture from the former would be rejected on account of the\r\ndisapprobation of the latter. The provinces might, perhaps, have not\r\nbeen inclined to the deliberations, or even cast off the sway of the\r\ncentral body, and make terms of peace for themselves. At any rate, all\r\nsuch hope was not precluded; at least some such trial might be made.\r\n\r\n\"Nor does it appear to me, as to Mr. Macaulay, that there was any, even\r\nthe slightest, inconsistency in Lord Chatham having first pronounced\r\nagainst the conquest of America, and yet refusing to allow her\r\nindependence. After the declaration in her behalf of France, Lord\r\nChatham had said, no doubt, that America could not be conquered. Had he\r\never said she could not be reconciled? It was on conciliation, and not\r\non conquest, that he built his later hopes. He thought the declaration\r\nof France no obstacle to his views, but rather an instrument for their\r\nsupport. He conceived that the treaty of alliance concluded by the\r\nenvoys of the Congress with the Court of Versailles might tend beyond\r\nany other cause to rekindle British feelings in the hearts of the\r\nAmericans. Were the glories of Wolfe and Amherst, in which they had\r\npartaken, altogether blotted from their minds? Would the soldier-yeomen\r\nof the colonies be willing to fight side by side with those French whom,\r\ntill within fifteen years, they had found in Canada their bitter\r\nhereditary foes? That consequences like to these--that some such\r\nrevulsion of popular feeling in America might, perhaps, ensue from an\r\nopen French alliance, is an apprehension which, during the first years\r\nof the contest, we find several times expressed in the secret letters of\r\nthe Revolution chiefs; it was a possibility which we see called forth\r\ntheir fears; why then might it not be allowed to animate the hopes of\r\nChatham?\"[7]\r\n\r\nBut Lord Chatham was not destined even to try the experiment of giving\r\nAmerica a second time to England; in a few days he fell in the House of\r\nLords, to rise no more, with the protest on his lips against the\r\nseparation of the American colonies from England. The Americans had no\r\nconfidence in the professions of a Parliament and Ministry which had\r\noppressed and sought to deceive them for twelve years. As low as the\r\nCongress had fallen in the estimation of a large part of the colonists,\r\nthe English Ministry was regarded with universal distrust and aversion.\r\nThe Congress refused even to confer with the Royal Commissioners, and\r\nhad sufficient influence to prevent any province from entering into\r\nnegotiations with them. All the former grounds of complaint had been\r\nremoved by the three Acts of Parliament above referred to, and all the\r\nconcessions demanded had been granted. The Royal Commissioners requested\r\nGeneral Washington, on the 9th of June (1778), to furnish a passport for\r\ntheir Secretary, Dr. Ferguson with a letter from them to Congress; but\r\nthis was refused, and the refusal was approved by Congress. They then\r\nforwarded, in the usual channel of communication, a letter addressed \"To\r\nhis Excellency Henry Laurens, the President, and other Members of\r\nCongress,\" in which they enclosed a copy of their commission and the\r\nActs of Parliament on which it was founded; and they offered to concur\r\nin every satisfactory and just arrangement towards the following among\r\nother purposes:\r\n\r\n\"To consent to a cessation of hostilities both by sea and land;\r\n\r\n\"To restore free intercourse, to revive mutual affection, and renew the\r\ncommon benefits of naturalization through the several parts of this\r\nempire;\r\n\r\n\"To extend every freedom to trade that our respective interests can\r\nrequire;\r\n\r\n\"To agree that no military forces shall be kept up in the different\r\nStates of North America without the consent of the General Congress, or\r\nparticular Assemblies;\r\n\r\n\"To concur in measures calculated to discharge the debts of America, and\r\nto raise the credit and value of the paper circulation;\r\n\r\n\"To perpetuate our union by a reciprocal deputation of an agent or\r\nagents from the different States, who shall have the privilege of a seat\r\nand voice in the Parliament of Great Britain; or if sent from Great\r\nBritain, in that case to have a seat or voice in the Assemblies of the\r\ndifferent States to which they may be deputed respectively, in order to\r\nattend to the several interests of those by whom they are deputed;\r\n\r\n\"In short, to establish the power of the respective Legislatures in each\r\nparticular State; to settle its revenue, its civil and military\r\nestablishment, and to exercise a perfect freedom of legislation and\r\ninternal government; so that the British States throughout North\r\nAmerica, acting with us in peace and war under one common sovereign, may\r\nhave the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege that is short of total\r\nseparation of interests, or consistent with that union of force on which\r\nthe safety of our common religion and liberty depends.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe three Acts of Parliament and the proposals of the five English\r\nCommissioners were far in advance of any wishes which the colonists had\r\nexpressed before the Declaration of Independence, and placed the\r\ncolonists on the footing of Englishmen--all that the Earl of Chatham and\r\nMr. Burke had ever advocated--all that the free, loyal, and happy\r\nDominion of Canada enjoys at this day--all and nothing more than was\r\nrequired for the unity of the empire and of the Anglo-Saxon race; but\r\nthe leaders of Congress had determined upon the dismemberment of the\r\nempire--had determined to sever all connection with the elder European\r\nbranch of the Anglo-Saxon family--had determined, and that without even\r\nconsulting the constituents whom they professed to represent, to\r\ntransfer their allegiance from England to France, to bind themselves\r\nhand and foot to France--that they would make no peace with England,\r\nupon any terms, without the consent of the French Court.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily conceived what an effect would be produced upon the\r\ntruly national mind of both England and America by such a transition on\r\nthe part of the leaders of Congress and their representatives abroad--a\r\ntransition which might be called a revolution, involving new issues and\r\nnew relations of parties; for the question was no longer one of mere\r\nseparation from England, much less the question of Stamp Acts, or\r\ntaxation without representation, or suspension of charters--all acts and\r\npretensions of this kind having been repealed and renounced; but the\r\nquestion was now one of union with the hereditary foe of England and her\r\ncolonies; and the unnatural alliance contemplated the invasion of\r\nEngland by the French, the destruction of British commerce, the wresting\r\nfrom England of the West Indies as well as Canada,[9] and the\r\npossession by France of whatever islands or territory her navy and army\r\nshould conquer.\r\n\r\nAll this was a different thing from mere independence of the mother\r\ncountry. The United Empire Loyalists and advocates of colonial rights\r\nwere now subject to a new allegiance, and punished as rebels and their\r\nproperty confiscated if they would not unite with the French against\r\ntheir English forefathers and brethren. So enamoured were the leaders of\r\nCongress with their new allies, that they interrupted the reading of the\r\nofficial letter from the British Commissioners on account of a passage\r\nwhich reflected upon France, and debated three days whether they should\r\nallow the remaining part of the letter to be read.[10]\r\n\r\nBut the feelings of all classes in England, and of a large part, if not\r\nthe great majority, of the colonists, were different from those of the\r\nleaders of Congress, now depleted of many distinguished men who attended\r\nits previous year's sittings.[11]\r\n\r\nBy this alliance with France the allied colonies became, as it were, a\r\npart of France, bound up in oneness with it--refusing all overtures or\r\nnegotiations with the representatives of England without the approval of\r\nthe French Court. The coasts, cities, towns, etc., of the American\r\nallies of France therefore became liable to the same treatment on the\r\npart of the British army and navy as the coasts, cities, and towns of\r\nFrance. Of this the British Commissioners informed the Congress, after\r\nthe latter had declared its identity with France, and refused any\r\nfurther intercourse with them.[12]\r\n\r\nThe war for a short time after this period became more acrimonious and\r\ndestructive on both sides than before, as between the French and\r\nEnglish. But this policy of devastation and retaliation was disapproved\r\nof by the British Government--was confined mostly to some certain coast\r\ntowns in New England, while in the South the conduct of Col. Campbell,\r\non the subjugation of Georgia, was marked by lenity and generosity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"While the American Commissioners were urging the Ministers\r\nof the King of France to accept the treaty proposed by Congress, they\r\nreceived assurances of the good wishes of the Court of France; but were\r\nfrom time to time informed that the important transactions required\r\nfurther consideration, and were enjoined to observe the most profound\r\nsecrecy. Matters remained in this fluctuating state from December, 1776,\r\ntill December, 1777. Private encouragement and public discountenance\r\nwere alternated; but both varied according to the complexion of news\r\nfrom America. The defeat on Long Island, the reduction of New York, and\r\nthe train of disastrous events in 1776, which have already been\r\nmentioned, sunk the credit of the Americans very low, and abated much of\r\nthe national ardour for their support. Their subsequent successes at\r\nTrenton and Princeton effaced these impressions, and rekindled active\r\nzeal in their behalf. The capture of Burgoyne (October, 1777) fixed\r\nthese wavering polities. The successes of the American campaign of 1777\r\nplaced them on high ground. Their enmity proved itself formidable to\r\nBritain, and their friendship became desirable to France. It was\r\ntherefore determined to take them by the hand and publicly espouse their\r\ncause. The Commissioners of Congress, on the 16th of December, 1777,\r\nwere informed by M. Gerard, one of the Secretaries of the King's Council\r\nof State, 'that it was decided to acknowledge the independence of the\r\nUnited States, and to make a treaty with them; that in the treaty no\r\nadvantage would be taken of their situation to obtain terms which\r\notherwise it would not be convenient for them to agree to; that his Most\r\nChristian Majesty desired the treaty, once made, should be durable, and\r\ntheir amity to subsist for ever, which could not be expected if each\r\nnation did not find an interest in its continuance as well as in its\r\ncommencement.'\" (Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II.,\r\nChap, xv., pp. 246, 247.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"MS. Instructions, May, 6th, 1776, State Paper Office.--It\r\nis therein required as a preliminary condition, before any province\r\nshall be declared in the King's peace, that its Convention, or\r\nCommittee, or Association 'which have usurped powers,' shall be\r\ndissolved.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lord Mahon's History of England, Vol. VI., Chap. liii., pp.\r\n137, 138.\r\n\r\nLord Mahon adds: \"At the beginning of the troubles, as I have already\r\nshown, and for a long time afterwards, the vast majority of the\r\nAmericans had no wish nor thought of separation from the mother country.\r\nTheir object was substantially, and with some new safeguards for their\r\nrights, to revert to the same state in which they had been before the\r\nAdministration of George Grenville. But the further the conflict\r\nproceeded, the less and less easy of attainment did that object seem.\r\nHow hard, after what had passed, to restore harmonious action between\r\nthe powers now at strife, for the people to trust the Governors\r\nappointed by the King, and for the King to trust the Assembly elected by\r\nthe people. Even where the actual wrong might have departed, it would\r\nstill leave its fatal legacy, rancour and suspicion, behind. Under the\r\ninfluence of these feelings a great number of persons in all the\r\ncolonies were gradually turning their minds to the idea of final\r\nseparation from the parent State. Still, in all these colonies, except\r\nonly in New England, there were many lingering regrets, many deep-rooted\r\ndoubts and misgivings. John Adams writes as follows: 'My dear friend\r\nGates, all our misfortunes arise from a single source--the reluctance of\r\nthe Southern colonies to republican government' (March, 1776, American\r\nArchives, Vol. V., p. 472). Here are the words of another popular\r\nleader: 'Notwithstanding the Act of Parliament for seizing our property,\r\nthere is a strange reluctance in the minds of many to cut the knot which\r\nties us to Great Britain'\" (Letter of Reed to Washington, March 3rd,\r\n1776).--_Ib._, pp. 139, 140.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxi., pp. 121, 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"The impression on the House that night, while Lord North\r\nwas speaking, and after he sat down, is well described by the pen of a\r\ncontemporary--no other, in all probability, than Burke: 'A dull,\r\nmelancholy silence for some time succeeded to this speech. It had been\r\nheard with profound attention, but without a single mark of approbation\r\nto any part, from any description of men, or any particular man in the\r\nHouse. Astonishment, dejection, and fear overclouded the whole assembly.\r\nAlthough the Minister had declared that the sentiments he expressed that\r\nday had been those which he always entertained, it is certain that few\r\nor none had understood him in that manner; and he had been represented\r\nto the nation at large as the person in it the most tenacious of those\r\nparliamentary rights which he now proposed to resign, and the most\r\nremote from the submissions which he now proposed to make.'\r\n\r\n\"It may be said, indeed, that there was not a single class or section\r\nwithin the walls of Parliament to which the plan of Lord North gave\r\npleasure. The Ministerial party were confounded and abashed at finding\r\nthemselves thus requested to acknowledge their past errors and retrace\r\ntheir former steps. Some among them called out that they had been\r\ndeceived and betrayed. In general, however, the majority acquiesced in\r\nsullen silence. On the other part, the Opposition were by no means\r\ngratified to see the wind, according to the common phrase, taken from\r\ntheir sails. They could not, indeed, offer any resistance to proposals\r\nso consonant to their own expressed opinions, but they took care to make\r\ntheir support as disagreeable and damaging as possible.\" (Lord Mahon's\r\nHistory of England, etc., Vol. VI., Chap. lvii., pp. 327-329.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: History of England, etc., Vol. VI., Chap. lvii, pp. 329,\r\n330.\r\n\r\nLord Mahon adds: \"Only two days previously, Lord North, who had opened\r\nhis Budget on the 6th, had carried through his financial resolutions in\r\nthe House of Commons, involving a new loan of £6,000,000, which was\r\ncontracted on advantageous terms. Thus were funds provided to pursue the\r\nwar, should that be requisite. Thus was an opening made for negotiations\r\nshould they be practicable. In either case the path was cleared for a\r\nnew Administration. Here then was the moment which Lord North had for\r\nsome time past desired--the moment when, with most honour to himself and\r\nwith most advantage to his country, he could fulfil his intentions of\r\nresigning.\" (Lord Mahon's History of England, Vol. VI., Chap. lvii, pp.\r\n330, 331.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Lord Mahon's History of England, Vol. VI., Chap. lvii., pp.\r\n344-347.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxv., pp. 254, 255.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: While Count D'Estaing was at Boston repairing his shattered\r\nfleet, he was not unmindful of an essential part of his commission--to\r\ndetach Canada from England. \"In pursuance of this design, a Declaration\r\nwas published (dated the 28th of October, 1778), addressed in the name\r\nof the King of France to the French inhabitants of Canada, and of every\r\nother part of America formerly subject to that Crown. This Declaration\r\ncontained the highest praises of the valour of the Americans; it laid\r\nbefore the inhabitants of Canada the mortification they must endure in\r\nbearing arms against the allies of their parent State; it represented to\r\nthem, in the strongest terms, the ties formed by origin, language,\r\nmanners, government, and religion, between the Canadians and the French,\r\nand lamented the misfortune which had occasioned a disjunction of that\r\ncolony from France; it recalled to their remembrance the brave\r\nresistance they had made during the many wars they had been engaged in\r\nagainst England, especially the last; it reminded them of their\r\nfavourite warriors and generals, particularly the valiant Montcalm, who\r\nfell at their head, in defence of their country; it earnestly entreated\r\nthem to reflect seriously on their disagreeable subjection to strangers\r\nliving in another hemisphere, differing from them in every possible\r\nrespect, who could consider them no otherwise than as a conquered\r\npeople, and would always, of course, treat them accordingly. It\r\nconcluded by formally notifying, that the Count D'Estaing was authorized\r\nand commanded by the King of France to declare, in his name, that all\r\nhis former subjects in North America who should renounce their\r\nallegiance to Great Britain might depend on his protection and support.\"\r\n(Dr. Andrews' History of the American War, Vol. III., Chap. xxxviii., p.\r\n171.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The conciliatory acts of the British Parliament and the\r\nletter of the Commissioners were referred by the Congress to a Committee\r\nof three--all known to be opposed to any reconciliation with England.\r\nThis Committee made, the next day after its appointment, a report which\r\nwas adopted by Congress, that the British acts were merely intended to\r\noperate upon the hopes and fears of the American people, and to produce\r\ndivisions among them; \"that those who made any partial convention or\r\nagreement with the Commissioners of Great Britain would be regarded as\r\nenemies; and that the United States could hold no conference with such\r\nCommissioners until the British Government _first withdrew its fleets\r\nand armies, or acknowledged the independence of the United States_.\"\r\n\r\n\"This _rejection_ of terms which they not long before would have\r\ncordially welcomed, _was, no doubt, caused by the confident expectation\r\nthey then had of the support and alliance of France_; and accordingly\r\nthe news of that alliance soon after reached them, and diffused a\r\ngeneral joy throughout the land.\" (Tucker's History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. I., Chap. iii., pp. 221, 222.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"The Declaration of Independence effected an alteration of\r\nsentiments in England. It was esteemed by many of the most judicious\r\npersons in this country, a measure wholly unnecessary, and without\r\nrecurring to which America might have compassed every point proposed by\r\ncontinuing its resistance to Britain on the same footing it had begun.\r\nThis measure occasioned an alienation from its interests in the minds of\r\nmany of its former adherents. It was looked upon as a wanton abuse of\r\nthe success with which it had opposed the efforts of the British\r\nMinistry to bring them to submission, and as an ungrateful return for\r\nthe warmth with which their cause had been espoused in Parliament, and\r\nby such multitudes as in the idea of many amounted to a plurality.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Declaration of France completed the revolution that had been\r\ngradually taking place in the opinions of men on their being repeatedly\r\napprised of the determination of Congress to break asunder all the bonds\r\nof former amity, and to unite themselves in the closest manner with that\r\nkingdom.\" (Dr. Andrews' History of the American War, Vol. III., Chap.\r\nxxxiv., pp. 82-84.)\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of France in favour of the independence of the American\r\ncolonies, and of alliance with them, was officially communicated to the\r\nBritish Government the 13th of March, 1778, a few days after which the\r\nFrench fleet under the command of Count D'Estaing sailed from Toulon,\r\nand arrived off the coast of America in July--after a long voyage of\r\neighty-seven days. On learning the departure of the French fleet for\r\nAmerica, the British Government sent out, in the same ships with the\r\nPeace Commissioners, orders to Sir Henry Clinton to concentrate his\r\nforces on Long Island and at New York. \"The successor of Howe, Sir Henry\r\nClinton, was,\" says Lord Mahon, \"in character, as upright and amiable;\r\nin skill and enterprise, much superior. Had the earlier stages of the\r\nwar been under his direction, his ability might not have been without\r\ninfluence upon them. But it was his misfortune to be appointed only at a\r\ntime when other foes had leagued against us, when the path was beset\r\nwith thorns and briars, when scarce any laurels rose in view. In\r\nconsequence of the impending war with France, and in conformity with the\r\nadvice of Lord Amherst to the King, instructions had been addressed to\r\nSir Henry, on the 23rd of March, to retire from the hard-won city of\r\nPhiladelphia, and concentrate his forces at New York. This order reached\r\nhim at Philadelphia, in the month of May, only a few days after he had\r\nassumed the chief command; only a few days before, there came on shore\r\nthe British Commissioners of Peace. These Commissioners might well\r\ncomplain with some warmth, in a secret letter to Lord George Germaine,\r\nthat an order so important, so directly bearing on the success of their\r\nmission, should have been studiously concealed from them until they\r\nlanded in America, and beheld it in progress of execution. Thus to a\r\nprivate friend wrote Lord Carlisle (one of the Commissioners): 'We\r\narrived at this place, after a voyage of six weeks, on Saturday last,\r\nand found everything here in great confusion--- the army upon the point\r\nof leaving the town, and about three thousand of the miserable\r\ninhabitants embarked on board of our ships, to convey them from a place\r\nwhere _they think they would receive no mercy from those who will take\r\npossession after us_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus from the first,\" says Lord Mahon, \"the Commissioners had against\r\nthem the news of a retreat from Philadelphia, and the news of the treaty\r\nof Paris; further, they had against them, as the Opposition in England\r\nhad long foreseen and foretold, the fact of their connection with Lord\r\nNorth. Even at the outset, before their affairs could be known (June 14,\r\n1778), one of the leaders in America, General Joseph Reed, answered a\r\nprivate note from one of them as follows: 'I shall only say that after\r\nthe unparalleled injuries and insults this country has received from the\r\nmen who now direct the affairs of Great Britain, a negotiation under\r\ntheir auspices has much to Struggle with.'\" \"How different,\" remarks\r\nLord Mahon, \"might have been his feelings, had they brought their\r\nCommission from Lord Chatham.\" (History of England, Vol. VI., Chap.\r\nlviii., pp. 372-374.)\r\n\r\nLord Mahon adds: \"Not any, even the smallest opening, was afforded to\r\nthese messengers of peace. They desired to despatch to the seat of\r\nCongress their Secretary, Dr. Adam Ferguson, the well-known Professor of\r\nEdinburgh, and they applied to Washington for a passport, but Washington\r\nrefused it until the pleasure of Congress should be known. The Congress,\r\non their part, had put forth a resolution declining even to hold any\r\nconference with the Commissioners unless, as a preliminary, they should\r\neither withdraw the fleets and armies, or else, in express terms,\r\nacknowledge the independence of the United States. In vain did the\r\nCommissioners address the President of the Congress, and entreat some\r\nconsideration of their terms. (For the terms, see page 11.) To none of\r\nthese terms, so tempting heretofore, would the Congress hearken; and\r\nafter their first letter, they decided in a summary manner that no\r\nfurther reply should be returned.\"--_Ib._, pp. 374, 375.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"Finding it impossible to proceed with their negotiations,\r\nthe Commissioners prepared to re-embark for England. First, however,\r\nthey issued a manifesto, or proclamation, to the American people,\r\nappealing to them against the decisions of the Congress, and offering to\r\nthe colonies at large, or singly, a general or separate peace. This\r\nproclamation was in most parts both ably and temperately argued. But\r\nthere was one passage liable to just exceptions. The Commissioners\r\nobserved, that hitherto the hopes of a reunion had checked the extremes\r\nof war. Henceforth the contest would be changed. If the British colonies\r\nwere to become an accession to France, the law of self-preservation must\r\ndirect Great Britain to render the accession of as little avail as\r\npossible to her enemy. Mr. Fox and others in the House of Commons\r\ninveighed with great plausibility against this passage, us threatening a\r\nwar of savage desolation. Others again, as friends of Lord Carlisle and\r\nMr. Eden (afterwards Lord Auckland), asserted that no such meaning was\r\nimplied. The error, whatever it might be, lay with the Commissioners,\r\nand in no degree with the Government at home; for Lord North denied, in\r\nthe most express terms, that his Ministers had intended to give the\r\nleast encouragement to the introduction of any new kind of war in North\r\nAmerica.\" (Debate in the House of Commons, Dec. 4, 1778.)\r\n\r\nLord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol. VI., Chap. lviii., pp. 376,\r\n377.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE FAILURE OF THE FRENCH FLEET AND ARMY, UNDER COUNT D'ESTAING, TO\r\nASSIST THE CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leaders of Congress were disappointed in the high expectations which\r\nthey had entertained from their unnatural alliance with France. Count\r\nD'Estaing left France with a much more powerful fleet than Lord Howe\r\ncommanded in America, besides bringing an army of several thousand\r\nsoldiers. He had expected to surprise and capture the British ships in\r\nthe River Delaware; but Lord Howe had sailed for New York several days\r\nbefore his arrival. Count D'Estaing pursued, and lay eleven days at\r\nanchor off Sandy Hook, not being able to get his large ships over the\r\nbar into New York harbour. He at length directed his course, by\r\nWashington's advice, to Long Island, and sailed up the Newport river,\r\nwhither he was followed by Lord Howe. \"An attack against the British in\r\nthat quarter had been projected between the new allies. The French\r\npromised to land from their ships four thousand troops, and the\r\nAmericans actually sent a detachment of ten thousand under General\r\nSullivan. The British troops, only five thousand strong, retired within\r\ntheir lines at Newport.\r\n\r\n\"At these tidings, Lord Howe, whose intended successor, Admiral Byron,\r\nhad not yet arrived, issued forth from the Hudson and sailed in pursuit\r\nof D'Estaing. The two fleets were on the point of engaging when\r\nseparated by a violent storm; there were conflicts between individual\r\nships only, in which the honour of the British flag was worthily\r\nmaintained. D'Estaing now declared his fleet so far damaged by the\r\nstorm as to compel him to put into Boston harbour and refit. In this\r\nresolution he persisted, though Sullivan, Greene, and other American\r\nofficers altogether denied the necessity, and even transmitted to him a\r\nwritten protest against it, couched in the most acrimonious terms.\"[13]\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that the course which D'Estaing pursued on this occasion\r\nnot only forced the Americans to relinquish their enterprise upon Long\r\nIsland, but roused up among them a bitter feeling against the French. To\r\nsuch an extent was this animosity carried that riots ensued in the\r\nstreets of Boston[14] between the American seamen and their new\r\nallies.[15]\r\n\r\nEven in regard to the mode of attacking the British on Long Island,\r\ndifferences arose between Count D'Estaing and his new American friends\r\non questions of etiquette. Mr. Tucker says: \"D'Estaing's fastidiousness\r\non points of etiquette, and his refusal to aid in what would have given\r\nso serious a blow to the British power in America, is calculated to\r\nraise a doubt whether he was really anxious to bring the war to an\r\nimmediate conclusion.\"[16] Early in November, Count D'Estaing, with the\r\nFrench squadron, quitted the port of Boston and sailed for the West\r\nIndies, there to pursue exclusively French objects. \"Deep was the\r\ndisappointment and loud the animadversion of the Americans in the\r\nNorthern provinces. They had formed the most sanguine hopes from the\r\nFrench alliance. They had found that alliance as yet little better than\r\na name.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe results of Count D'Estaing's expedition, and of the French alliance\r\nthus far, are well summed up by Dr. Ramsay in the following words: \"With\r\nthe abortive expedition to Rhode Island there was an end to the plans\r\nwhich were in this first campaign projected by the allies of Congress\r\nfor co-operation. The Americans had been intoxicated with hopes of the\r\nmost decisive advantages; but in every instance they were disappointed.\r\nLord Howe, with an inferiority of force, not only preserved his own\r\nfleet, but counteracted and defeated all the views and attempts of Count\r\nD'Estaing. The French fleet gained no direct advantages for the\r\nAmericans; yet their arrival was of great service to their cause.\r\nBesides deranging the plans of the British, it carried conviction to\r\ntheir minds that his Most Christian Majesty was seriously disposed to\r\nsupport them. The good-will of their new allies was manifested to the\r\nAmericans; and though it had failed in producing the effects expected\r\nfrom it, the failure was charged to winds, weather, and unavoidable\r\nincidents. Some censured Count D'Estaing; but while they attempted to\r\nconsole themselves by throwing blame on him, they felt and acknowledged\r\ntheir obligation to the French nation, and were encouraged to persevere\r\nin the war, from the hope that better fortune would attend their future\r\nco-operation.\"[18] Count D'Estaing proceeded with his fleet to the West\r\nIndies, where he did nothing worthy of the large fleet, reinforced by\r\nthat of Count de Grasse with several thousand troops, against the\r\nEnglish fleet under the command of Admiral Byron--much inferior in both\r\nmen and metal; but the French admiral declined and evaded any general\r\nengagement, though repeatedly provoked to it. \"The British fleet\r\nendeavoured in vain to compel the enemy to come to close fight; they\r\navoided it with the utmost circumspection and dexterity.\"[19]\r\n\r\nIt became indispensably necessary for Admiral Byron to provide a\r\npowerful convoy to the merchant shipping now on the eve of their\r\ndeparture for England, and whose cargoes were of immense value. Under\r\nall the circumstances, Admiral Byron determined to convoy the homeward\r\ntrade with his whole fleet, till it was out of danger of being followed\r\nby Count D'Estaing or of falling in with M. de la Motte, who was on his\r\nway from France to the French islands with a strong squadron. During\r\nAdmiral Byron's absence, Count D'Estaing directed an attack to be made\r\non the island of St. Vincent, the garrison of which was very\r\ninconsiderable, and soon surrendered to the superior strength of the\r\nFrench, assisted by a great multitude of the Caribbee Indians, and who\r\nseized this opportunity of revenging themselves for injuries inflicted\r\nupon them by the English during the last French war.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Count D'Estaing was still further reinforced by the\r\narrival of the squadron commanded by M. de la Motte. His fleet now\r\nconsisted of twenty-six ships of the line and twelve frigates, and his\r\nland force amounted to ten thousand men. With this powerful armament he\r\nsailed for the island of Grenada, the strength of which consisted of\r\nabout one hundred and fifty regulars and three or four hundred armed\r\ninhabitants. The garrison was compelled to yield to the prodigious\r\nsuperiority of force against them, after a most heroic defence, in\r\nwhich no less than three hundred of the French were killed and\r\nwounded.[20]\r\n\r\nThe complaints of the Americans of the failure of Count D'Estaing's\r\nexpedition to America, of his abandoning the expedition against Long\r\nIsland, of his leaving the coasts of the Southern colonies unprotected\r\nand exposed, and proceeding to the West Indies, reached the French\r\nCourt, which sent instructions to Count D'Estaing enjoining him to\r\nreturn with all speed to the assistance of the colonies. For this\r\npurpose he left the West Indies on the 1st of September. Mr. Tucker\r\nremarks: \"General Lincoln (commander of the colonial forces in Carolina)\r\nhaving informed Count D'Estaing that the British ships had gone into\r\nport to repair the damages sustained in the late engagement with his\r\nfleet in the West Indies, and that a fair opportunity was presented of\r\ndestroying the British army in Georgia, with the co-operation of the\r\nFrench fleet, the Count immediately left the West Indies, with\r\ntwenty-two sail of the line and eleven frigates. He had on board six\r\nthousand land forces, and arrived so unexpectedly on the coast that a\r\nBritish fifty-gun ship and three frigates fell into his hands. He then,\r\nin conjunction with General Lincoln, planned an attack on the town of\r\nSavannah.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for the attack having been made, the whole French fleet\r\ncame to anchor at the mouth of the Savannah river on the 1st day of\r\nSeptember. He was occupied ten days in landing his troops and\r\nartillery; on the 15th of September a junction was formed between the\r\nFrench and General Lincoln,[22] and with the utmost confidence of\r\nsuccess.[23]\r\n\r\nThey determined to take the town by siege rather than by storm in the\r\nfirst instance.[24]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of September they demanded, in a very confident and haughty\r\ntone, the surrender of the town to the arms of the King of France; but\r\nGeneral Prevost declined surrendering on a general summons, and\r\nrequested a specific statement of the terms of it. The Count replied\r\nthat it was for the besieged to propose the terms. General Prevost\r\nrequested and obtained twenty-four hours' suspension of hostilities to\r\nprepare his answer. Before the twenty-four hours had elapsed,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Maitland, with several hundred men who had been\r\nstationed at Beaufort, made their way through inland channels and\r\nswamps, and joined the royal standard at Savannah; and General Prevost\r\ngave his answer of no surrender. The French and Americans, who formed a\r\njunction the evening after, resolved to besiege the town, and consumed\r\nseveral days in preparing for it, while the works of the garrison were\r\nhourly strengthened by great labour and skill. From the 24th of\r\nSeptember to the 4th of October a heavy cannonade on both sides was kept\r\nup; but the allied army, finding that they could make little or no\r\nimpression on the works of the besieged, resolved on a bombardment, with\r\na stronger cannonading than ever. On the 4th of October the besiegers\r\nopened on the town three batteries, with nine mortars, thirty-seven\r\npieces of cannon from the land side, and fifteen from the water. The\r\nfiring from these batteries lasted, with little intermission, during\r\nfive days; but the damage they did was confined mostly to the town,\r\nwhere some houses were destroyed and some women and children killed.\r\nSoon after the commencement of the cannonade, General Prevost requested\r\npermission to remove the women and children out of the town to a place\r\nof safety; but this request was refused in offensive terms on the part\r\nof Count D'Estaing, by the advice of General Lincoln, on the pretext\r\nthat a desire of secreting the plunder lately taken from the South\r\nCarolinas was covered under the veil of humanity, but the real reason\r\nwas that the surrender of the town would be expedited by keeping the\r\nwomen and children in it.[25]\r\n\r\nCount D'Estaing, finding that his five days' cannonading made no\r\nimpression on the defensive works of the city, and his officers\r\nremonstrating against his continuing to risk so valuable a fleet on a\r\ndangerous coast, in the hurricane season, and at so great a distance\r\nfrom shore that it might be surprised by a British fleet, now completely\r\nrepaired in the West Indies and fully manned, he decided to assault the\r\ntown. The attack was commenced in three columns on the 9th, an hour\r\nbefore sunrise.\r\n\r\n\"Though the besieged were prepared for the assault, and their fire was\r\nvery destructive, the assailants pressed on and planted (for a few\r\nminutes) the standard of both nations on the walls; but the contest\r\nbeing still obstinately continued, the assailants were brought to a\r\npause by the fall of Count Pulaski (commanding an American corps), who\r\nreceived a mortal wound; and Major Glaziers, who commanded the garrison,\r\nrushing at the head of a body of grenadiers and marines, drove back the\r\nallied troops, who were ordered to retreat. The French lost seven\r\nhundred men; the Americans, two hundred and thirty-four. The British\r\ngarrison lost only fifty-five in killed and wounded. On the 16th of\r\nOctober the siege was raised by the Count, who thus for the third time\r\nfailed in his co-operation with the Americans, after the fairest\r\nprospects of success.\"[26]\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft states the final struggle of this eventful contest, and the\r\nresults and effects of it on the Southern colonies, in the following\r\nwords:--\"After an obstinate struggle of fifty-five minutes to carry the\r\nredoubt, the assailants retreated before a charge of grenadiers and\r\nmarines, led gallantly by Maitland. The injury sustained by the British\r\nwas trifling; the loss of the Americans was about two hundred; of the\r\nFrench, thrice as many. The French withdrew their ships, and sailed for\r\nFrance; the patriots of Georgia who had joined them fled to the\r\nbackwoods or across the river.\r\n\r\n\"Lincoln repaired to Charleston, and was followed by what remained of\r\nhis army; the militia of South Carolina returned to their homes; its\r\ncontinental regiments were melting away; and its paper money became so\r\nnearly worthless, that a bounty of twenty-five hundred dollars for\r\ntwenty-one months' service had no attraction. The dwellers near the sea\r\nbetween Charleston and Savannah were shaken in their allegiance, not\r\nknowing where to find protection. Throughout the State the people were\r\ndisheartened, and foreboded desolation.\"[27]\r\n\r\nI have given a more minute account of Count D'Estaing and his abortive\r\nexpeditions to America, and of his final attack upon Savannah and its\r\nresults; how completely disappointed were the American revolutionists\r\nthus far in their unnatural alliance with France against England; how\r\nlittle mutual respect or good-will, and what quarrels occurred, whenever\r\nthey came or attempted to act together, whether at Boston, or Long\r\nIsland, or Charleston, or Savannah; and how much feebler the army and\r\nmore gloomy the prospects of the Congress party were at the end of 1779\r\nthan they were two years before, when the alliance with France was\r\nformed. Dr. Ramsay well sums up these events as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The campaign of 1779 is remarkable for the feeble exertions of the\r\nAmericans. Accidental causes, which had previously excited their\r\nactivity, had in a great measure ceased to have influence. An enthusiasm\r\nfor liberty made them comparatively disregard property and brave all\r\ndangers in the first years of the war. The successes of their arms near\r\nthe beginning of 1777, and the hope of capturing Burgoyne's army in the\r\nclose of it, together with the brisk circulation of a large quantity of\r\npaper-money, in good credit, made that year both active and decisive.\r\nThe flattering prospects inspired by the alliance with France in 1778\r\nbanished all fears of the success of the revolution, but the failure of\r\nevery scheme of co-operation produced a despondency of mind unfavourable\r\nto great exertions. Instead of driving the British out of the country,\r\nas the Americans vainly presumed, the campaigns of 1778 and 1779\r\nterminated without any direct advantage from the French fleet sent to\r\ntheir aid. Expecting too much from their allies, and then failing in\r\nthese expectations, they were less prepared to prosecute the war with\r\ntheir own resources than they would have been if D'Estaing had not\r\ntouched on their coast. Their army was reduced in its numbers and badly\r\nclothed.\r\n\r\n\"In the first years of the war, the mercantile character was lost in the\r\nmilitary spirit of the times; but in the progress of it the inhabitants,\r\ncooling in their enthusiasm, gradually returned to their former habits\r\nof lucrative business. This made distinctions between the army and\r\ncitizens, and was unfriendly to military exertions. While several\r\nforeign events tended to the embarrassment of Great Britain,[28] and\r\nindirectly to the establishment of independence, a variety of internal\r\ncauses relaxed the exertions of the Americans, and for a time made it\r\ndoubtful whether they would ultimately be independent citizens or\r\nconquered subjects.\"[29]\r\n\r\nEven a year later--\"The military force,\" says Mr. Tucker, \"embarked in\r\nthe beginning of 1781, to maintain the cause of independence, is thus\r\nstated in (Chief Justice) Marshall's Life of Washington: The Southern\r\ntroops, from Pennsylvania to Georgia, did not exceed three thousand men.\r\nOf the Northern troops, twelve hundred had been detached to Virginia,\r\nunder La Fayette; with these they amounted only to three thousand\r\neffective men in April. The cavalry and artillery was less than one\r\nthousand. With some small additions, the whole reached four thousand men\r\nin May. They were ill supplied with clothing, and were seriously\r\nthreatened with a want of provisions. The quartermaster's department was\r\nwithout means of transport,\" (Marshall, Vol. IV., p. 446).[30]\r\n\r\nSuch was the character and such the fruits of the alliance with France\r\nduring the first two years of its existence; and such was the state of\r\nthe revolutionary army in 1780, and which seems to have been largely\r\nowing to the incapacity and ill conduct of the Congress itself, which\r\nhad become degenerate and corrupt--equal to that of any British\r\nParliament, or of any Provincial Legislature, under any Royal\r\nGovernor.[31]\r\n\r\nAbundant evidence can be adduced in proof and illustration of this\r\nstatement from the warmest partizans of Congress; but the testimony of\r\nWashington himself is ample and indisputable. In the winter of 1778-9 he\r\nhad to concert his measures with Congress at Philadelphia, and he writes\r\nfrom thence as follows to his friend Benjamin Harrison:\r\n\r\n\"If I were to be called upon to draw a picture of the times and of men\r\nfrom what I have seen, heard, and in part known, I should in one word\r\nsay that idleness, dissipation, and extravagance seem to have laid fast\r\nhold of them; that speculation, peculation, and an insatiable thirst for\r\nriches seem to have got the better of every other consideration and of\r\nevery order of men; that party disputes and personal quarrels are the\r\ngreat business of the day; whilst the momentous concerns of an empire, a\r\ngreat and accumulating debt, ruined finances, depreciated money, and\r\nwant of credit, which in its consequence is the want of everything, are\r\nbut secondary considerations, and postponed from day to day, and from\r\nweek to week, as if our affairs wore the most promising aspect. * * Our\r\nmoney is now sinking fifty per cent. a day in this city, and I shall not\r\nbe surprised if in the course of a few months a total stop is put to the\r\ncurrency of it; and yet an assembly, a concert, a dinner, a supper, that\r\nwill cost three or four hundred pounds, will not only take men from\r\nacting in this business, but from thinking of it; while a great part of\r\nthe officers of our army, from absolute necessity, are quitting the\r\nservice. * * I have no resentments, nor do I mean to point at particular\r\ncharacters. This I can declare upon my honour, for I have every\r\nattention paid me by Congress that I could possibly expect. * * But\r\nsuch is the picture which from my inmost soul I believe to be true; and\r\nI confess to you that I feel more real distress on account of the\r\npresent appearances of things, than I have done at any time since the\r\ncommencement of the dispute.\"[32]\r\n\r\nSuch is General Washington's own account of the character and occupation\r\nof the Congress of the United States in the third year of the\r\nrevolutionary war, and in the second year of their alliance with\r\nFrance--idleness, dissipation, extravagance, speculation, peculation,\r\navarice, party and personal quarrels, dancing, feasting; while the\r\ncredit was reduced almost to nothing, and the army neglected and\r\nsuffering.[33]\r\n\r\nSuch was the progress of the war; such the failure of the expeditions of\r\nthe French alliance; such the state of the revolutionary army, and of\r\nthe public credit; and such the degenerate character and proceedings of\r\nCongress and its surroundings in the beginning of 1780--the fifth year\r\nof the civil war.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: \"They urged D'Estaing to return with his fleet into the\r\nharbour; but his principal officers were opposed to the measure, and\r\nprotested against it. He had been instructed to go into Boston if his\r\nfleet met with any misfortune. His officers insisted on his ceasing to\r\nprosecute the expedition against Rhode Island, that he might conform to\r\nthe orders of their common superiors. A protest was drawn up and sent to\r\nhim, which was signed by John Sullivan, Nathaniel Greene, John Hancock,\r\nI. Glover, Ezekiel Cornel, William Whipple, John Tyler, Solomon Lovell,\r\nJohn Fitconnel. They protested against the Count's taking the fleet to\r\nBoston, as derogatory to the honour of France, contrary to the intention\r\nof his Christian Majesty and the interests of his nation, destructive in\r\nthe highest degree to the welfare of the United States, and highly\r\ninjurious to the alliance formed between the two nations. Had D'Estaing\r\nprosecuted his original plan within the harbour, either before or\r\nimmediately after the pursuit of Lord Howe, the reduction of the British\r\npost on Rhode Island (which had been in the possession of the British\r\nsince 1776) would have been probable; but his departure in the first\r\ninstance to engage the English fleet, and in the second from Rhode\r\nIsland to Boston, frustrated the whole.\" (Dr. Ramsay's History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. II., Chap. xvi., p. 272.)\r\n\r\n\"Whatever were the reasons which induced Count D'Estaing to adopt that\r\nmeasure (of sailing with his fleet direct for Boston), the Americans\r\nwere greatly dissatisfied. They complained that they had incurred great\r\nexpense and danger, under the prospect of the most effective\r\nco-operation; that depending thereon, they had risked their lives on an\r\nisland, where, without naval protection, they were exposed to particular\r\ndangers; that in this situation they were first deserted, and afterwards\r\ntotally abandoned, at a time when, by persevering in the original plan,\r\nthey had well-grounded hopes of speedy success. Under these\r\napprehensions the discontented militia went home in such crowds that the\r\nregular army, which remained was in danger of being cut off from a\r\nretreat. In these embarrassing circumstances, General Sullivan\r\nextricated himself with judgment and ability. He began to send off his\r\nheavy artillery and baggage on the 26th, and retreated from the lines on\r\nthe night of the 28th.\" (Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol.\r\nVI., Chap. lviii., p. 173.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: \"The inveteracy to the French, traditionally inherent in\r\nthe lower classes of the New England people, could not be restrained\r\nfrom breaking out in Boston, in manner that might have been attended\r\nwith the most serious consequences to the interests of both France and\r\nAmerica, had not the prudence of the magistracy interposed on the one\r\nhand, and the sagacity of Count D'Estaing co-operated on the other. A\r\ndesperate fray happened in that city between the populace and the French\r\nsailors, in which these were roughly handled, and had much the worse. A\r\nnumber of them were hurt and wounded, and some, it was reported, were\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely at the same time, a disturbance of a like nature happened at\r\nCharleston, in South Carolina, between the French and American seamen,\r\nbut it was carried to much greater extremities; they engaged on both\r\nsides with small arms, and even with cannon.

In these expeditions the principal commander was\r\nGeneral Charles Grey, an officer of great zeal and ardour, whom the\r\nAmericans sometimes surnamed the 'No-flint General,' from his common\r\npractice of ordering the men to take the flints out of their muskets,\r\nand trust to their bayonets alone.

After the\r\naccomplishment of this object, he next proposed no less than a total\r\ndeliverance of America from the terror of the British arms. This was to\r\nbe effected by the destruction of the British fleet at New York. The\r\nlatter part of the plan he doubted not to accomplish through the\r\nco-operation of the American army under Washington.\" (Dr. Andrews'\r\nHistory of the Late War, Vol. III., Chap. xlv., pp. 308, 309.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: \"A junction being formed by the French and American\r\nforces, they amounted together to between nine and ten thousand men.\r\nCount D'Estaing had five thousand regulars, and near one thousand stout\r\nmulattos and free negroes, well armed.

The\r\nBritish were equally diligent in preparing for their defence.

It was\r\nagreed, accordingly, that each of them should carry on their respective\r\napproaches without interference from the other side. This method was\r\nparticularly agreeable to the French, who, looking upon themselves as\r\nincomparably superior to the Americans, did not choose to divide any\r\nhonour with these, to which they imagined that they alone were\r\nentitled.\" (Dr. Andrews' History of the Late War, Vol. III., Chap, xlv.,\r\npp. 312, 313.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Count D'Estaing was afterwards so ashamed of this inhuman\r\nrefusal, that after the repulse of his assault upon the garrison he\r\napologized for it, and offered the permission requested, but which was\r\nno longer needed, and therefore refused.\r\n\r\nGeneral Stedman, referring to this circumstance, says: \"On the morning\r\nof the 4th of October, the batteries of the besiegers having opened with\r\na discharge from fifty-three pieces of heavy cannon and fourteen\r\nmortars, a request was made by General Prevost that the women and\r\nchildren might be permitted to leave the town and embark on board\r\nvessels in the river, which should be placed under the protection of\r\nCount D'Estaing, and wait the issue of the siege. But this proposal,\r\ndictated by humanity, was rejected with insult. Fortunately, however,\r\nfor the inhabitants as well as the garrison, although an incessant\r\ncannonade from so many pieces of artillery was continued from the 4th to\r\nthe 9th of October, less injury was done to the houses in the town than\r\nmight have been expected; few lives were lost, and the defences were in\r\nno respect materially damaged.\" (Stedman's History of the American War,\r\nVol. II., Chap, xxx., p. 127.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Tucker's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap,\r\niii., p. 250.\r\n\r\nThis disastrous attack upon Savannah was followed by mutual\r\nrecriminations between the French and American officers and soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"No good agreement, it has been said, subsisted between the French and\r\nAmericans from the commencement of the siege, and their mutual dislike\r\nwas now increased by disappointment. After the assault, the French could\r\nno longer conceal their contempt for their new allies; they styled them\r\n'insurgents' in common conversation and even in written memorials.\"\r\n(General Stedman's History of the American War, Vol. II., Chap, xxx., p.\r\n132.)\r\n\r\n\"While the British troops were enjoying the satisfaction resulting from\r\nthe success that was due to their conduct and valour, the enemy was in a\r\ncondition of discontent and sullenness which had like to have terminated\r\nfatally. The Americans could not conceal their disapprobation of the\r\nwhole proceedings of Count D'Estaing, nor he the contemptuous light in\r\nwhich he held them. Reciprocal taunts and reproaches came to such a\r\nheight between both the officers and soldiers of either party, that it\r\nwas once thought they would have proceeded to actual violence.\r\n\r\n\"A motive which strongly influenced the Americans was the jealousy they\r\nhad conceived against the French commander, on account of his having\r\nsummoned General Prevost to _surrender to the arms of France_, without\r\nincluding those of the United States of America. They inferred from\r\nthence, that either he considered them as unworthy of the honour of\r\nbeing mentioned conjointly with the King of France, or that he meant to\r\nretain the province of Georgia for that Crown in case of reduction.\r\nWhichever of the two was the meaning of the French commander, it exposed\r\nhim equally to the indignation of the Americans.\r\n\r\n\"To this it may be added, that the inhuman refusal of the request of\r\nGeneral Prevost for a permission to the women and children to depart\r\nfrom the town of Savannah during the siege, was now by the French\r\nattributed to the Americans, whom they accused of brutality, and whose\r\ngeneral, a French officer of rank, was loaded with the coarsest and most\r\ninjurious appellations, in common with his other countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"From the day of their repulse, both the French and Americans abandoned\r\nall further prosecution of the siege.\r\n\r\n\"In this manner was the province of Georgia cleared a third time of the\r\nenemy, after the most sanguine expectations had been entertained by all\r\nAmerica that the reduction of this province would have been a\r\npreparatory step to the expulsion of the British fleets and armies from\r\nevery part of the continent.\" (Dr. Andrews' History of the War, etc.,\r\nVol. III., Chap. xlv., pp. 316-318.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. X., Chap.\r\nxiii., pp. 297, 298.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: \"In the latter part of this year (1779), Spain decided on\r\njoining France in the war, anxious as she was to take the chance of\r\nrecovering Gibraltar, Jamaica, and the Floridas.\" (Tucker's History of\r\nthe United States, Vol. I., Chap. iii., p. 251.)\r\n\r\nThus England had arrayed against her two of the most powerful\r\nGovernments, with the two most powerful fleets in Europe, besides the\r\nwar in America.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxvii., pp. 305, 306.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Tucker's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap.\r\niii., p. 282.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: \"There were never more than forty members present--often\r\nno more than twenty.

The\r\nsales were generally made on credit, and by the progressive\r\ndepreciation, what was dear at the time of the purchase, was very cheap\r\nat the time of payment. When this measure was first adopted, little or\r\nno injustice resulted from it, for at that time the paper bills were\r\nequal, or nearly equal, to gold or silver of the same nominal sum. In\r\nthe progress of the war, when depreciation took place, the case was\r\nmaterially altered.\r\n\r\n\"The aged, who had retired from the scenes of active business to enjoy\r\nthe fruits of their industry, found their substance melting away to a\r\nmere pittance, insufficient for their support. The widow who lived\r\ncomfortably on the bequests of a deceased husband, experienced a\r\nfrustration of all his well-meant tenderness. The laws of the country\r\ninterposed and compelled her to receive a shilling, where a pound was\r\nher due. The hapless orphan, instead of receiving from the hands of an\r\nexecutor a competency to set out in business, was obliged to give a\r\nfinal discharge on the payment of sixpence in the pound.\" (Dr. Ramsay's\r\nHistory of the United States, Vol. II., Chap. xviii., pp. 315, 316.)\r\n\r\n\"The paper-money,\" says Lord Mahon, \"had gradually fallen to\r\none-twentieth, to one-thirtieth, nay, in some cases to not less than\r\none-hundredth of its nominal value! But perhaps one practical instance\r\nmay make this case clearer. In December of this year (1779), and in the\r\nState of Maryland, an English officer received an innkeeper's bill,\r\nwhich in his Travels he has printed at full length, amounting in\r\npaper-money to £732 and some shillings; and this bill he paid in gold\r\nwith four guineas and a half.\" (Aubury's Travels, Vol. II., p. 492.)\r\n(Lord Mahon's History, etc., Vol. VI., Chap. lviii., p. 416.)\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington thus describes this state of things in regard to\r\nevery man in the public service: \"What officers can bear the weight of\r\nprices that every necessary article is now got to? A rat, in the shape\r\nof a horse, is not to be bought at this time for less than two hundred\r\npounds, nor a saddle under thirty or forty pounds; boots twenty, and\r\nshoes and other articles in like proportion. How is it possible,\r\ntherefore, for officers to stand this without an increase of pay? And\r\nhow is it possible to advance their pay when flour is selling at\r\ndifferent places from five to fifteen pounds per hundredweight, hay from\r\nten to thirty pounds, and beef and other essentials in like proportion?\"\r\nThe depreciation still proceeding, Washington a few months afterwards\r\nsays that \"a waggon load of money will now scarcely purchase a waggon\r\nload of provisions.\" (Letters to Governor Morris, October 4th, 1778; and\r\nto the President of the Congress, April 23rd, 1779.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n1780--A YEAR OF WEAKNESS AND DISASTER TO THE AMERICAN CAUSE, AND OF\r\nSUCCESS TO THE BRITISH ARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1780 was inauspicious for the revolutionary cause, but\r\nauspicious for the English. The financial embarrassments arising from\r\nthe depreciation of the paper-money engaged the anxious deliberations of\r\nCongress,[34] and Washington's army was by no means able to cope with\r\nthe northern division of the English army.[35]\r\n\r\nBut La Fayette, now returned from a recent visit to France, during which\r\nhe had obtained from the French Court a loan of money and reinforcements\r\nof naval and land forces, Washington contemplated the recovery of New\r\nYork, which had long been a favourite object with him. The French\r\nsquadron of seven sail of the line, and five frigates and transports,\r\nunder the command of Chevalier de Ternay, arrived at Newport harbour,\r\nLong Island, on the 10th July, having on board six thousand troops,\r\nunder the command of Count de Rochambeau, who, in order to prevent the\r\nrepetition of previous disputes, was directed to put himself under\r\nWashington's orders; and on all points of precedence and etiquette--this\r\nwas the first division of the promised reinforcements from France--the\r\nFrench officers were to give place to the Americans. Washington and\r\nCount de Rochambeau agreed upon an attack on New York. The British had\r\nin New York only four ships of the line and a few frigates; but three\r\ndays after the arrival of the French squadron, Admiral Graves reached\r\nNew York with six ships of the line. Having now the naval superiority,\r\nthe British, instead of waiting to be attacked, proposed to attack the\r\nFrench at Newport, and for which purpose Sir Henry Clinton embarked with\r\nsix thousand men; but as Sir Henry Clinton and Admiral Arbuthnot could\r\nnot agree on a plan of operations, the British troops were disembarked.\r\nThe fleet proceeded to blockade the French ships, and the revolutionary\r\narmy was obliged to remain at Newport for their protection. \"News\r\npresently arrived that the French second division was detained at Brest,\r\nblockaded there by another British squadron. Instead of being an\r\nassistance, the French auxiliaries threatened to be a burden; three\r\nthousand troops and five hundred militia were kept under arms at Newport\r\nto assist in guarding the French ships. Thus a third time--as it seemed,\r\nalmost a sort of fatality--the attempt at French co-operation proved a\r\nfailure.\"[36]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Clinton, on leaving the Count D'Estaing after his defeat at\r\nSavannah, had left the coast of Georgia with his fleet for France,\r\ndetermined to extend his military operations south, with a view of\r\ncompleting the submission of the Southern States. Leaving the garrison\r\nof New York under the command of General Knyphausen, he proceeded in\r\nperson on an expedition against South Carolina, and besieged Charleston,\r\nthe capital. Information had been obtained at Charleston of Sir Henry\r\nClinton's intention two months before the arrival of his fleet and\r\ntroops, and the city was fortified on all sides, and on its redoubts,\r\nlines, and batteries were mounted eighty pieces of cannon and mortars.\r\nThe commander, General Lincoln, had a force of 7,000 men of all\r\ndenominations under arms, and was expecting large reinforcements. The\r\narmy of Sir Henry Clinton was increased by a reinforcement of 3,000\r\nmen--making in the whole about 9,000 men under his command.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the siege, the Governor of the State, by the\r\nextraordinary powers conferred upon him by the Legislature, issued a\r\nproclamation requiring such of the militia as were regularly drafted,\r\nand all the inhabitants and _owners of property in the town, to repair\r\nto the American standard and join the garrison immediately, under pain\r\nof confiscation_.\r\n\r\nThe siege commenced the 3rd of April, and was protracted to the 11th of\r\nMay. The terms of capitulation proposed by each party in the earlier\r\npart of the siege were mutually declined. Cannonading continued on each\r\nside until the British opened batteries on the third parallel, played\r\nupon the American garrison with cannon and mortars at a distance of less\r\nthan a hundred yards, advanced within twenty-five yards of the American\r\nworks, and were ready for making a general assault by land and water\r\nwhen, on the 11th of May, \"a great number of citizens addressed General\r\nLincoln in a petition, expressing their acquiescence in the terms which\r\nSir Henry Clinton had offered, and requested his acceptance of them. On\r\nthe reception of this petition, General Lincoln wrote to Sir Henry, and\r\noffered to accept the terms before proposed. The royal commanders,\r\nwishing to avoid the extremity of storming the city, and unwilling to\r\npress to unconditional submission an enemy whose friendship they wished\r\nto conciliate, returned a favourable answer. A capitulation was signed\r\non the 12th of May, and Major General Leslie took possession of the town\r\nthe next day. Upwards of 400 pieces of artillery were surrendered.[37]\r\nBy the articles of capitulation, the garrison was to march out of town\r\nand deposit their arms in front of the works, but the drums were not to\r\nbeat a British march, nor the colours to be uncased. The continental\r\ntroops and seamen were to keep their baggage and remain prisoners of war\r\ntill exchanged. The militia were to be permitted to return to their\r\nrespective homes, as prisoners on parole; and while they adhered to\r\ntheir parole, were not to be molested by the British troops in person or\r\nproperty. The inhabitants, of all conditions, were to be considered as\r\nprisoners on parole, and to hold their property on the same terms with\r\nthe militia. The officers of the army and navy were to retain their\r\nservants, swords, pistols, and baggage unsearched. They were permitted\r\nto sell their horses, but not to remove them. A vessel was allowed to\r\nproceed to Philadelphia with General Lincoln's despatches unopened.\"[38]\r\n\r\nShortly after the capture of Charleston, Sir Henry Clinton embarked for\r\nNew York with the principal part of his army;[39] but before his\r\ndeparture he performed several important acts both as Royal Commissioner\r\nand as Commander-in-Chief of the army.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of the capital, it was proposed to awe the\r\ndisaffected and secure the universal submission of the people by sending\r\nout three expeditions.\r\n\r\n\"One expedition was sent by Clinton up the Savannah, to encourage the\r\nloyal and reduce the disaffected in the neighbourhood of Augusta:\r\nanother proceeded for like purpose to the district of Ninety-Six, where\r\nWilliamson surrendered his post and accepted British protection. A third\r\nand larger party, under Cornwallis, moved across the Santee towards\r\nCamden.\"[40]\r\n\r\nThese expeditions rather weakened than strengthened the influence of the\r\nBritish cause, as compulsion rather than conciliation was employed to\r\nre-establish British supremacy; and the proclamations and orders issued\r\nby Sir Henry Clinton before his departure for New York, defeated rather\r\nthan promoted the objects intended by them.[41]\r\n\r\nAfter issuing his proclamation (for the purport of which see previous\r\nnote), Sir Henry Clinton took his departure, with the major part of his\r\narmy, for New York, leaving Lord Cornwallis in command with four\r\nthousand troops.[42]\r\n\r\n\"Lord Cornwallis, considering South Carolina as entirely reannexed to\r\nGreat Britain, would admit of no neutrality among the inhabitants; but\r\ninsisted on their taking the oath of allegiance, which, however, was\r\ngenerally taken with reluctance by the people of the lower country. This\r\npart of the State was still further alienated by the licentious and\r\nplundering habits of the British soldiers over a conquered country, and\r\nby the seduction of many of the slaves from their masters.\"[43]\r\n\r\nThere can be no justification of Lord Cornwallis's policy; but there\r\nwere some mitigating circumstances that palliate the severities which he\r\ninflicted. Among those who had been taken prisoners at the capture of\r\nCharleston, and professed loyalty, was, as Lord Mahon says, \"One Lisle,\r\nwho had not only taken the oath of allegiance, but accepted military\r\nrank as a King's officer; waited just long enough to supply his\r\nbattalion with clothes, arms, and ammunition from the royal stores, and\r\nthen quietly led them back to his old friends. Highly incensed at such\r\nsignal acts of treachery as Lisle's, Lord Cornwallis had recourse to\r\nsome severe orders in return. The penalty of death was denounced against\r\nall militiamen who, after serving with the English, went off to the\r\ninsurgents. Several of the prisoners in the battle of Camden, men taken\r\nwith arms in their hands and British protections in their pockets, were\r\nhanged. Other such examples were made at Augusta and elsewhere. Some who\r\nhad been living on their parole at Charleston, and who, in spite of that\r\nparole, carried on a secret correspondence with their insurgent\r\ncountrymen, were shipped off to St. Augustine. A proclamation was\r\nissued, sequestering the estates of those who had been the most forward\r\nto oppose the establishment of the royal authority within the province.\r\nPerhaps these measures exceeded the bounds of justice; certainly they\r\ndid the bounds of policy. This was shown by the fatal event, when, on\r\nthe overthrow of the royalist cause in South Carolina, the measures of\r\nLord Cornwallis became the plea for other executions and for every act\r\nof oppression that resentment could devise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Within the more limited sphere of his own command, Lord Rawdon had\r\nrecourse to, or at the very least announced, some measures still more\r\nsevere, and far less to be justified. In a letter to one of his\r\nofficers, which was intercepted, we find, for example, what follows: 'I\r\nwill give the inhabitants ten guineas for the head of every deserter\r\nbelonging to the volunteers of Ireland; and five guineas only if they\r\nbring him in alive.' No amount of provocation or of precedent in his\r\nenemies, no degree of youthful ardour in himself, are at all adequate to\r\nexcuse these most blamable words. When, however, he was called upon to\r\nvindicate them, Lord Rawdon declared that many of his threats were meant\r\nonly 'to act on the fears and prejudices of the vulgar,' and by no means\r\nto be carried into practical effect.\"[44]\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the year there were various skirmishes and\r\nbattles between volunteer parties of Independents, under such leaders as\r\nSumpter and Clarke, and detachments of the British army, with various\r\nsuccess, but nothing which affected the supremacy of the royal cause,\r\nthough the moral influence of it was widely weakened by the arbitrary\r\npolicy of the British commanders and the conduct of the British troops.\r\nThe prospects of the revolution were very gloomy,[45] and its leaders\r\nwere much disheartened. In these circumstances of depression and\r\ndespondency, an earnest appeal was made to France for men and money,[46]\r\nand the transactions following show that the appeal was not made in\r\nvain, and that French ships and troops were the main instruments in\r\ndeciding the battle which was followed by the acknowledgment of American\r\nIndependence.[47]\r\n\r\nMr. Hildreth, referring to the close of this year, says: \"So far,\r\nindeed, as related to America, Great Britain had good reason to be\r\nsatisfied with the late campaign. Georgia was entirely subdued, and the\r\nroyal government re-established. The possession of Charleston, Augusta,\r\nNinety-Six, and Camden, supported by an army in the field, secured\r\nentire control over all the wealthy parts of South Carolina. North\r\nCarolina was full of Tories, anxiously awaiting the approach of\r\nCornwallis. The three Southern States were incapable of helping\r\nthemselves, and those further north, exhausted and penniless, were\r\nlittle able to send assistance. It seemed as if the promises so often\r\nmade by Lord George Germaine's American correspondents were now about to\r\nbe fulfilled, and the rebel colonies to sink beneath the accumulated\r\npressure of this long-protracted struggle.\"[48]\r\n\r\nThus, at the close of 1780, the military conflicts were almost\r\ninvariably successful on the side of the British; the resources of the\r\nrevolutionists in both money and men were exhausted, and their hopes of\r\nsuccess utterly extinguished without foreign aid. But though the British\r\nwere successful on the fields of battle, they everywhere lost in the\r\nconfidence, esteem, and affections of the people, even of the Loyalists.\r\nYet the prospects of the war party of independence were gloomy indeed.\r\nGeneral Washington felt that some great achievement was necessary to\r\nrevive the hopes of his fellow-countrymen, and save from dissolution his\r\ndaily decreasing army. His only hope was in aid from France. His words\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n\"Without an immediate, ample, and efficacious succour in money, we may\r\nmake a feeble and expiring effort in our next campaign, _in all\r\nprobability the period of our opposition_. Next to a loan in money, _a\r\nconstant naval superiority on these coasts_ is the object the most\r\ninteresting.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: \"The commissaries, greatly in debt, had neither money nor\r\ncredit, and starvation began to stare the soldiers in the face. To\r\nsupport his army, Washington was again obliged to resort to the harsh\r\nexpedient of levying contributions on the surrounding country. Each\r\ncounty was called upon for a certain quantity of flour and meat; but as\r\nthe civil authorities took the matter of supply in hand, for which\r\ncertificates were given by the commissaries on the appraisement of two\r\nmagistrates, the use of force did not become necessary.\" (Hildreth's\r\nHistory of the United States, Vol. III., Chap. xi., p. 301.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: \"Washington's entire force scarcely exceeded ten thousand\r\nmen, a number not equal to the (British) garrison of New York; and even\r\nof these a considerable number were militia drafts, whose terms of\r\nservice were fast expiring.\"--_Ib._, p. 303.\r\n\r\nBut though New York was in possession of the British, and strongly\r\ngarrisoned, apprehensions were entertained of attacks upon the several\r\nEnglish garrison posts in the State from invasions of marauding parties\r\nof the revolutionary army, from facilities of approach on account of the\r\nfreezing over of all the rivers from the extreme severity of this\r\nwinter. It is singular that while Benjamin Franklin was leader of the\r\nRevolutionists, and now United States Minister to France, his son was\r\none of the leaders of the Loyalists. \"It was now,\" says Mr. Hildreth,\r\n\"that the 'Board of Associated Loyalists' was formed, of which Franklin,\r\nlate Royal Governor of New Jersey, released by exchange from his tedious\r\nconfinement in Connecticut, was made president. Washington, however, was\r\nin no condition to undertake an attack, and the winter passed off with\r\nfew skirmishes.\" (Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. III.,\r\nChap. xi., p. 303.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Ib._, pp. 311, 312.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: \"In the siege, the British lost seventy-six killed and one\r\nhundred and eighty-nine wounded; the Americans about an equal number.\r\nThe prisoners, exclusive of sailors, amounted to five thousand six\r\nhundred and eighteen, counting all the adult males of the town.\"\r\n(Tucker's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap. lii., p. 253.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxx., pp. 337, 338.\r\n\r\nYet in the face of the facts above stated by Dr. Ramsay, who was an\r\nofficer on General Washington's staff, and afterwards member of\r\nCongress, where he had access to the official documents and letters from\r\nwhich he compiled his history, Mr. Bancroft makes the following\r\nstatements and remarks: \"The value of the spoil, which was distributed\r\nby English and Hessian commissaries of captures, amounted to about\r\n£300,000 sterling, so that the dividend of a major-general exceeded\r\n4,000 guineas. There was no restraint on private rapine; the silver\r\nplate of the planters was carried off; all negroes that had belonged to\r\nthe rebels were seized, even though they had themselves sought an asylum\r\nwithin the British lines; and at one embarkation 2,000 were shipped to a\r\nmarket in the West Indies. British officers thought more of amassing\r\nfortunes than of re-uniting the empire. The patriots were not allowed to\r\nappoint attorneys to manage or sell their estates, a sentence of\r\nconfiscation hung over the whole land, and British protection was\r\ngranted only in return for the unconditional promise of loyalty.\"\r\n(Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. X., Chap. xiv., pp. 305,\r\n306.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: \"Sir Henry Clinton, having left about 4,000 men for\r\nSouthern service, embarked early in June with the main army for New\r\nYork. On his departure the command devolved on Lieutenant-General\r\nCornwallis.\" (Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxx., p. 341.)\r\n\r\n\"They saw South Carolina apparently won back to the royal cause, and\r\nwith some probability that North Carolina would follow the example. But\r\nat this crisis intelligence reached Sir Henry Clinton that the Americans\r\nupon the Hudson (under the command of General Washington) were on the\r\npoint of receiving considerable succours; that a French fleet sent to\r\ntheir aid, with several French regiments on board, might soon be\r\nexpected off the New England coasts. Sir Henry deemed it his duty to\r\nprovide in person for the safety of his principal charge. In the first\r\ndays of June he accordingly re-embarked for New York, with a portion of\r\nhis army; leaving, however, about 4,000 men under Lord Cornwallis's\r\ncommand. The instructions given to Lord Cornwallis were to consider the\r\nmaintenance of Charleston, and in general of South Carolina, as his main\r\nand indispensable objects; but consistently with these, he was left at\r\nliberty to make 'a solid move,' as it was termed, into North Carolina,\r\nif he judged it proper or found it possible.\" (Lord Mahon's History,\r\netc., Vol. VII., Chap. lxii., p. 70.)\r\n\r\nOn the eve of leaving Charleston for New York, Sir Henry reported to the\r\nBritish Colonial Minister, Lord Germaine: \"The inhabitants from every\r\nquarter declare their allegiance to the King, and offer their services\r\nin arms. There are few men in South Carolina who are not either our\r\nprisoners or in arms with us.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. X., Chap.\r\nxiv., p. 306.\r\n\r\n\"The universal panic consequent on the capture of Charleston had\r\nsuspended all resistance to the British army. The men of Beaufort, of\r\nNinety-Six, and of Camden, had capitulated under the promise of\r\nsecurity. They believed that they were to be treated as neutrals or as\r\nprisoners on parole. There remained to them no possibility of flight\r\nwith their families; and if they were inclined to take up arms, there\r\nwas no American army around which they could rally.\" (Bancroft's History\r\nof the United States, Vol. X., Chap. xiv., p. 307.)\r\n\r\n\"No organized American force was now left in either of the Carolinas.\r\nThe three most Southern States had not a battalion in the field, nor\r\nwere the next three much better provided. The Virginia line had been\r\nmostly captured at Charleston, or dispersed in subsequent engagements.\r\nThe same was the case with the North Carolina regiments. The recent\r\nbattle of Camden had reduced the Maryland line to a single regiment--the\r\nDelaware line to a single company.\" (Hildreth's History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. III., Chap. xi., p. 316.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: \"On the 22nd of May, confiscation of property and other\r\npunishments were denounced against all who should thereafter oppose the\r\nKing in arms, or hinder any one from joining his forces. On the 1st of\r\nJune, a proclamation by the Commissioners Clinton and Arbuthnot, offered\r\npardon to the penitent on their immediate return to allegiance; to the\r\nloyal, the promise of their former political immunities, including\r\nfreedom from taxation, except by their own Legislature. This policy of\r\nmoderation might have familiarized the Carolinians once more to the\r\nBritish Government; but the proclamation was not communicated to\r\nCornwallis--so that when, three weeks later, two leading men, one of\r\nwhom had been in a high station, and both principally concerned in the\r\nrebellion, went to that officer to surrender themselves under its\r\nprovisions, he could only answer that he had no knowledge of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"On the 3rd of June (the day of his departure from Charleston), Clinton,\r\nby a proclamation which he alone signed, cut up British authority in\r\nCarolina by the roots. He required all the inhabitants of the province,\r\neven those outside of Charleston, 'who were now prisoners on parole,' to\r\ntake an active part in securing the royal government. 'Should they\r\nneglect to return to their allegiance,' so ran the proclamation, 'they\r\nwill be treated as rebels to the government of the King.' He never\r\nreflected that many who accepted protection from fear or convenience,\r\ndid so in the expectation of living in a state of neutrality, and that\r\nthey might say, 'If we _must fight_, let us fight on the side of our\r\nfriends, of our countrymen of America.'\" (Bancroft's History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. X., Chap. xiv., pp. 307, 308.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: \"Earl (afterwards Marquis) Cornwallis was born in 1738.\r\nEarly in life he had embraced the military profession, which he pursued\r\nwith undeviating honour, though variable success. In him the want of any\r\nshining talents was in a great measure supplied by probity, by\r\npunctuality, by steady courage, by vigilant attention to his duties. In\r\n1776, on the Declaratory Bill, he had shown his conciliatory temper to\r\nthe colonies; denying, with Lord Camden and only three Peers besides,\r\nany right we had to tax them while they remained unrepresented in the\r\nHouse of Commons. When, however, the war broke forth, he acted solely as\r\nbecame a soldier. Under Lord Cornwallis was now serving a young officer\r\nof no common spirit and daring, destined, like himself, to attain, at\r\nanother period, the highest office that an Englishman out of England can\r\nfill--the office of Governor-General of India. This was Francis Lord\r\nRawdon, subsequently better known, first as Earl of Moira, and then as\r\nMarquis of Hastings.

Since Congress itself made a public\r\nconfession of its powerlessness, nothing remained but _to appeal to\r\nFrance_ for rescue, not from a foreign enemy, but from the evils\r\nconsequent on its own want of government. 'If France lends not a speedy\r\naid,' wrote General Greene from the South to her Minister in\r\nPhiladelphia, 'I fear the country will be for ever lost.' It was\r\ntherefore resolved for the moment to despatch to Versailles, as a\r\nspecial minister, one who had lived in the midst of the ever-increasing\r\ndistresses of the army, to set them before the Government of France in\r\nthe most striking light. The choice fell on the younger Laurens, of\r\nSouth Carolina. To this agent Washington confided a statement of the\r\ncondition of the country; and with dignity and candour avowed that it\r\nhad reached a crisis out of which it could not rise by its own\r\nunassisted strength.

British garrisons kept down open resistance, in the vicinity\r\nof the places where they were established; but as soon as they were\r\nwithdrawn and the people left to themselves, a spirit of revolt hostile\r\nto Great Britain always displayed itself; and the standard of\r\nindependence, whenever it was prudently raised, never wanted followers\r\namong the active and spirited part of the community.\" (Dr. Ramsay's\r\nHistory of the United States, Vol. II., Chap. xx., p. 363.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH AND CONGRESS ALLIES IN 1781 RECOVER VIRGINIA--SURRENDER OF\r\nLORD CORNWALLIS--RESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the adverse circumstances and gloom which attended and closed the\r\nyear 1780, as stated in the preceding chapter, Washington felt the\r\nnecessity of doing something bold and great to revive the confidence of\r\nhis countrymen and arrest the decline of his army.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, a campaign of operations was devised and\r\nagreed upon by Washington and the commander of the French troops. The\r\ncentres of British power in America were the army of about ten thousand\r\nmen in New York, under the immediate command of Sir Henry Clinton, who\r\nwas, indeed, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in North America;\r\nand secondly, the army of Virginia, about seven thousand men, under the\r\ncommand of Earl Cornwallis; and thirdly, the garrison of Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, under the command of Lord Rawdon; Savannah, the capital\r\nof Georgia, was also occupied by a British garrison. Washington's plan\r\nwas to pretend an attack upon New York, but to make a real attack upon\r\nthe army of Virginia, with the view of extinguishing British power in\r\nthe Southern States. So well was the appearance of an intended attack\r\nupon New York kept up, that Sir Henry Clinton made all needful\r\npreparations for its defence, and actually ordered Lord Cornwallis to\r\nsend a detachment of his men to New York to strengthen its defence; but\r\nafter their embarkation for that purpose the order was countermanded,\r\nand Lord Cornwallis was allowed to retain them. Nothing could be more\r\ncomplete than the deception practised upon Sir Henry Clinton; nor did\r\nhe suspect the real intention of the allied armies until they had\r\ncrossed the Hudson and were on their way, through the Jerseys,\r\nPennsylvania, and Maryland, to Virginia.[49]\r\n\r\n\"In the latter end of August,\" says Dr. Ramsay, \"the American army began\r\ntheir march to Virginia from the neighbourhood of New York. Washington\r\nhad advanced as far as Chester before he received information of the\r\narrival of De Grasse. The French troops marched at the same time, for\r\nthe same place. In the course of this summer they passed through all the\r\nextensive settlements which lie between Newport and Yorktown. It seldom\r\nif ever happened before, that an army led through a foreign country at\r\nso great a distance from their own, among a people of different\r\nprinciples, customs, language, and religion, behaved with so much\r\nregularity. In their march to Yorktown they had to pass through five\r\nhundred miles of a country abounding in fruit, and at a time when the\r\nmost delicious productions of nature, growing on and near the public\r\nhighways, presented both opportunity and temptation to gratify their\r\nappetites, yet so complete was their discipline, that in this long march\r\nscarce an instance could be produced of a peach or an apple being taken\r\nwithout the consent of the inhabitants.\"[50]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September, Washington and De Rochambeau, in advance of\r\ntheir armies and with their respective staffs of officers, arrived at\r\nWilliamsburg; and with Generals Chastellux, Du Portail, and Knox,\r\nvisited Count de Grasse on board his famous ship, the _Ville de Paris_,\r\nand agreed on the plan of operations against Earl Cornwallis at\r\nYorktown, on York river, to which the allied armies at once proceeded,\r\nfor the purpose of besieging it. On the 1st day of October, General\r\nWashington was able to report to the President of Congress that the\r\ninvestment of the place was completed. \"Gloucester (on the opposite side\r\nof the river, not a mile wide there), which was held by Colonel Dundas,\r\nwas beleaguered by some Virginian troops, and by the French legion of\r\nthe Duke de Lauzun. Yorktown, where Cornwallis in person, and with his\r\nmain force, commanded, saw to his left the division of La Fayette, and\r\nto his right the division of St. Simon. Other bodies of troops filled\r\nthe space between them, while Washington and Rochambeau fixed their\r\nposts near together, towards the centre. They brought up fifty pieces of\r\ncannon, for the most part heavy, by aid from the French ships, as also\r\nsixteen mortars, and they lost no time in commencing their first\r\nparallel against the town.[51] By the 9th the first parallel was\r\ncompleted, when the town and its defences were cannonaded and shelled.\r\nWithin another week a second parallel was completed within three\r\nhundred yards of the defences, two redoubts stormed and taken--one by\r\nthe French and the other by the Americans--and the further defence of\r\nthe town rendered impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Down to this time, the 15th of October, Lord Cornwallis had expected\r\nreinforcements of ships and troops from New York;[52] but he now\r\ndespaired of aid from that quarter, and attempted to escape with his\r\narmy in the night across the river, which was prevented by a storm, when\r\nthe only alternative left him was to surrender on the best terms he\r\ncould obtain. On the morning of the 17th he sent a flag of truce to\r\nWashington, proposing a cessation of arms, and a treaty for the\r\ncapitulation of his post. Hostilities ceased; the terms of surrender\r\nwere discussed and agreed upon on the 18th by four commissioners, two\r\nfield officers being named on each side. The army, and all that belonged\r\nto it, was surrendered to Washington; and the ships and seamen to Count\r\nde Grasse\" (Tucker).\r\n\r\n\"All the artillery and public stores in the two forts, together with the\r\nshipping and boats in the two harbours, were to be surrendered by the\r\nEnglish. On the other hand, private property of every kind was to be\r\nrespected by the Americans and French. The garrisons of York and\r\nGloucester were to march out with the same honours of war as had been\r\ngranted by Sir Henry Clinton at Charleston; the land forces to remain\r\nprisoners of the United States, and the naval forces prisoners of\r\nFrance. The soldiers were to be kept in Virginia, Maryland, or\r\nPennsylvania, and as much by regiments as possible. The general staff\r\nand other officers not left with the troops to be permitted to go to New\r\nYork, or to Europe, on parole.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Yorktown, and the surrender of Lord Cornwallis to the arms\r\nof the French and the Americans, may be regarded as the last battle of\r\nimportance of the civil war in America. American writers and orators are\r\nfond of saying that here was brought face to face on the battle-field\r\nthe strength of Old England and Young America, and the latter prevailed.\r\nNo statement can be more unfounded, and no boast more groundless than\r\nthis. England, without an ally, was at war with three kingdoms--France,\r\nSpain, and Holland--the most potent naval and military powers of Europe;\r\nwhile were also arrayed against her, by an \"armed neutrality,\" Russia,\r\nPrussia, Denmark, and Sweden. England was armed to the teeth for the\r\ndefence of her own shores against threatened invasion, while her navies\r\nwere maintaining in sundry battles the honour of the British flag on\r\nthree seas.\r\n\r\nA small part only of the British land and naval forces was on the coast\r\nof America; yet there were garrisons at Savannah and Charleston, and a\r\nmuch larger military force at New York, under the command of Sir Henry\r\nClinton, than that of Yorktown, under Lord Cornwallis. In the following\r\ncampaign the English fleet was victorious over the French fleet in the\r\nWest Indies, capturing the great ship _Ville de Paris_, and taking Count\r\nde Grasse himself prisoner. In the siege of Yorktown there were about\r\n18,000 of the allied army of French and Americans, besides ships of the\r\nline and sailors, while the effective men under command of Lord\r\nCornwallis amounted to less than 4,000. It was a marvel of skill and\r\ncourage that with an army so small, and in a town so exposed and so\r\nincapable of being strongly fortified, and against an allied force so\r\noverwhelming, Lord Cornwallis was able to sustain a siege for a\r\nfortnight, until he despaired of reinforcements from New York.\r\n\r\nBe it also observed, that the greater part of the forces besieging\r\nYorktown were not Americans, but French, who supplied the shipping and\r\nartillery; in short, all the attacking forces by water, and a duplicate\r\nland enemy--the one part under the command of Count de Rochambeau, and\r\nthe other part under the command of the Marquis de La Fayette. Had it\r\nnot been for the French fleet and the French land forces, Washington\r\nwould not have attempted an attack upon Yorktown. The success of the\r\nsiege was, therefore, more French than American, though Washington had\r\nthe nominal command of the allied army.\r\n\r\nNo one can doubt the undaunted courage and matchless skill of\r\nWashington, and his great superiority over any English general ever sent\r\nagainst him; nor can the bravery and endurance of his army be justly\r\nquestioned; nor the dash and boldness and gallantry of the French army.\r\nBut it is idle to speak of the siege of Yorktown as a trial of strength\r\nbetween Young America and Old England. And it is equally incorrect to\r\nsay that the resources of England, in men or money, in ships or land\r\nforces, were exhausted, or that England was compelled to make peace in\r\nconsequence of the disaster of Lord Cornwallis. There had been a peace\r\nparty, both in and out of Parliament, opposed to the American war from\r\nthe beginning. That party included some of the ablest statesmen in\r\nEngland, and increased in strength and influence from year to year, by\r\nexposing the incompetence, extravagance, and corruption of the\r\nAdministration, the failure of all their plans, and the non-fulfilment\r\nof any of their promises in regard to America; that although they could\r\ndefeat the Americans in the field of battle, they had not conquered and\r\nthey could not conquer the hearts of the people, who became more and\r\nmore alienated from England by the very example and depredations of the\r\nBritish officers and soldiers. The surrender of Lord Cornwallis, the\r\nimportance of which was greatly magnified, increased the intensity of\r\nEnglish feeling against the continuance of the American war, until the\r\npeace party actually gained a majority in the House of Commons,\r\ncompelled the retirement of the old and corrupt Ministry, which had been\r\nthe cause of all the oppressions in the American colonies and all the\r\nmiseries of the war. Session after session, the leaders of the\r\nOpposition in both the Lords and Commons moved resolutions condemning\r\nthe American war and the manner of conducting it; the Duke of Richmond,\r\nthe Marquis of Rockingham, the Earl of Shelburne in the Lords; and\r\nGeneral Conway, Mr. Fox, Mr. Burke, Lord John Cavendish, Mr. Hartley,\r\nMr. Dunning (afterwards Lord Ashburton), and Sir James Lowther in the\r\nCommons. Several resolutions were introduced into the Commons\r\ncondemnatory of the war in America, with a view of reducing the colonies\r\nto submission, and were defeated by small majorities--in one a majority\r\nof ten, and in another a majority of only _one_. At length they were\r\ncensured and rejected by the Commons without a division.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February, General Conway moved \"That an address should be\r\npresented to his Majesty, to implore his Majesty to listen to the advice\r\nof his Commons, that the war in America might no longer be pursued for\r\nthe impracticable purpose of reducing the inhabitants of that country to\r\nobedience by force, and to express their hopes that his Majesty's desire\r\nto restore the public tranquillity might be forwarded and made effectual\r\nby a happy reconciliation with the revolted colonies.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthened debate, this resolution was negatived--one hundred\r\nand ninety-three for the resolution, against it one hundred and\r\nninety-four--a majority of one for the continuance of the war.\r\n\r\nThe motion having been objected to as vague in its terms, General\r\nConway, on the 27th of February, introduced another motion, the same in\r\nsubstance with the previous one, but varied in phraseology, so as to\r\nmeet the rules of the House, and more explicit in its terms. This\r\nresolution was strongly opposed by the Ministry; and after a long debate\r\nthe Attorney-General moved the adjournment of the House: For the\r\nadjournment voted two hundred and fifteen; against it, two hundred and\r\nthirty-four--majority of nineteen against the Ministry--so that the\r\noriginal question, and an address to the King, framed upon the\r\nresolution, were then earned without a division.[54] The King returned a\r\ngracious but vague answer.\r\n\r\nGeneral Conway, after moving a vote of thanks to the King for his\r\ngracious answer, followed by moving a resolution: \"That this House would\r\nconsider as enemies to his Majesty and the country all those who should\r\nadvise or by any means attempt the further prosecution of offensive war,\r\non the continent of North America, for the purpose of reducing the\r\nrevolted colonies to obedience by force.\" This motion, after a feeble\r\nopposition from the Ministry, was allowed to pass without a division.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed, under these circumstances, that the Ministry would\r\nforthwith resign; but they continued to hold on to office, which they\r\nhad held for twelve years, to the great injury of England and her\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nTo bring the matter to an issue, the following resolution was moved on\r\nthe 8th of March by Lord John Cavendish, seconded by Mr. Powys:\r\n\r\n\"That it appears to this House, that since the year 1775 upwards of one\r\nhundred millions of money have been expended on the army and navy in a\r\nfruitless war.\r\n\r\n\"That it appears to this House, that during the above period we have\r\nlost the thirteen colonies of America, which anciently belonged to the\r\nCrown of Great Britain (except the ports of New York, Charleston, and\r\nSavannah), the newly acquired colony of Florida, many of our valuable\r\nWest India and other islands, and those that remain are in the utmost\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\"That it appears to this House, that Great Britain is at present engaged\r\nin an expensive war with America, France, Spain, and Holland, without a\r\nsingle ally.\r\n\r\n\"That it appears to this House, that the chief cause of all these\r\nmisfortunes has been the want of foresight and ability in his Majesty's\r\nMinisters.[55]\"\r\n\r\nThe facts stated in the first three of these resolutions were admitted\r\non all sides; the discussion, therefore, turned upon the conclusion\r\ndrawn in the last resolution, the justice of which was patent to all\r\nfrom the uniform failure and disgrace of the policy and all the separate\r\nmeasures of Ministers during the whole of their administration. It was\r\nattempted to be argued, in defence of Ministers, that misfortune did not\r\nalways prove misconduct; that the failure of execution of measures might\r\ndepend, not on those who planned them, but on the fault of those who\r\nwere to execute them. But \"this ground,\" says the Parliamentary\r\nRegister, \"appeared so weak, even to the friends of the Administration,\r\nthat it was almost entirely deserted, except by the Ministers\r\nthemselves; and the question was taken up with great art and ingenuity\r\non other topics, as to who would succeed the Administration they were\r\nendeavouring to remove, and the diversity of opinions among them. But\r\nthe efforts on the part of Ministers and their friends to create\r\njealousies and discords among the members of the Opposition proved\r\nfruitless; and when the final vote was proposed, the Secretary of War\r\nevaded it by moving the order of the day, which was carried by a\r\nmajority of ten.\"\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the 8th and 14th, every intrigue was employed to\r\ncreate discord among the members of the Opposition, and to bring about a\r\ncoalition under the presidency of Lord North, and a resolution was moved\r\nto that effect, which was lost by a majority of only nine.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Surrey gave notice that on the morning of the 20th inst. he\r\nwould move, in substance, Lord John Cavendish's resolution directly\r\ncondemnatory of the Ministry. On that morning Lord North and the Earl of\r\nSurrey rose at the same moment, and neither would give way to the other.\r\nThe general cry was \"Lord Surrey, and no adjournment.\" As soon as the\r\nHouse could be reduced to order, it was moved \"That the Earl of Surrey\r\nbe now heard,\" when Lord North, having obtained the right to speak,\r\nsaid, \"I rise to speak to the motion before the House.\" He observed that\r\nhad he been suffered to proceed before, he believed much unnecessary\r\nheat and disorder would have been prevented. He meant no disrespect to\r\nthe noble earl; but as notice had been given that the object of the\r\nintended motion was the removal of his Majesty's Ministers, he meant to\r\nhave acquainted the House that such a motion had become unnecessary. He\r\ncould assure the House with authority that _the present Administration\r\nwas no more_, and that his Majesty had come to a full determination of\r\nchanging his Ministers; and that it was for the purpose of giving\r\nnecessary time for new arrangements that he meant to have moved an\r\nadjournment.\r\n\r\nThe noble lord then took leave of the House as a Minister of the Crown,\r\nand with many kind and courteous words thanked them for the honourable\r\nsupport they had given him during so long a course of years.[56]\r\n\r\nBy such blows following each other in the Commons, in rapid succession\r\nand with accelerated force, was driven from power an Administration\r\nwhich had inflicted greater evils upon the Crown, the constitution, the\r\npeople of England and of the colonies, than any Administration since the\r\nRevolution of 1688.[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: It appears, however, that in the first consultation, which\r\n\"took place at Weathersfield, between Generals Washington, Knox, and Du\r\nPortail on the part of the Americans, and Count de Rochambeau and the\r\nChevalier Chastellux on the part of the French, it was agreed to lay\r\nsiege to New York in concert with the French fleet, which was to arrive\r\non the coast in the month of August. Washington addressed letters to the\r\nexecutive officers of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New\r\nJersey, requiring them to fill up their battalions, and to have their\r\nquotas of six thousand two hundred militia in readiness within a week\r\nafter the time they might be called for. But all these States not adding\r\nfive hundred men to Washington's army, Sir Henry Clinton having received\r\na reinforcement of three thousand Germans, and intelligence having been\r\nreceived that Count de Grasse, with a French fleet of twenty-eight ships\r\nand seven thousand troops (besides seamen), had sailed for the\r\nChesapeake, Washington and Count de Rochambeau changed their plan of\r\noperations and determined to proceed to Virginia, and, in combination\r\nwith the French fleet and soldiers, to capture the army under the\r\ncommand of Earl Cornwallis in Virginia. The appearance of an intention\r\nto attack New York was nevertheless kept up. While this deception was\r\nplayed off, the allied army crossed the North River on August 24th, and\r\npassed on by the way of Philadelphia through the intermediate country to\r\nYorktown, Virginia. An attempt to reduce the British force in Virginia\r\npromised success with more expedition, and to secure an object of nearly\r\nequal importance to the reduction of New York.\" (Ramsay's History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. II., Chap. xxv., pp. 448-451.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxxv., pp. 450, 451.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol. VII., Chap.\r\nlxiv., p. 172.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, Lord Cornwallis is admitted to have shown most\r\nundaunted resolution. The officers under him, and the troops, German and\r\nEnglish, all did their duty well. For some weeks they had laboured hard,\r\nand unremittingly, in raising their defences; and they were now prepared\r\nwith equal spirit to maintain their half-completed works. But besides\r\nthe enemy without, they had another within--an epidemic sickness, that\r\nstretched many hundreds helpless in their pallet-beds. Nor could they\r\nhinder Washington from completing his first parallel and opening his\r\nfire upon them in the evening of the 9th of October. For two days the\r\nfire was incessant from heavy cannon, and from mortars and howitzers,\r\nthrowing shells in showers on the town, until, says Cornwallis, all our\r\nguns on the left were silenced, our works much damaged, and our loss of\r\nmen considerable. By these shells, also, the _Charon_, a ship of\r\nforty-four guns, together with three British transports in the river,\r\nwere set in flames and consumed.\"--_Ib._, p. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Before the investment of Yorktown, Lord Cornwallis sent a\r\ndespatch to Sir Henry Clinton, informing him of the delicacy and danger\r\nof his situation, and requesting reinforcements. On the evening of the\r\n29th of September, Lord Cornwallis was cheered by the arrival of an\r\nexpress, bringing despatches from Sir Henry Clinton, dated the 24th,\r\ninforming him that by the 5th of October a fleet of twenty-three sail of\r\nthe line, three of which were three-deckers, with 5,000 men, rank and\r\nfile, would start for his assistance. The auxiliary forces at New York\r\nwere ready and eager to depart by the 5th of October; but the ships were\r\ndelayed by the slowness and obstinacy of Admiral Arbuthnot. Sir Henry\r\nClinton writes: \"We had the misfortune to see almost every succeeding\r\nday produce some naval obstruction or other to protract our departure;\r\nand I am sorry to add, that it was the afternoon of the 19th before the\r\nfleet was fairly at sea. This was the day of Lord Cornwallis's\r\ncapitulation. Five days afterwards the fleet with the 5,000 troops\r\narrived off the Chesapeake, when they received the news of the surrender\r\nof Lord Cornwallis, and sailed back to New York. Had these auxiliary\r\nforces started from New York at the time promised, the siege of Yorktown\r\nwould have been raised, the allied army defeated, and Lord Cornwallis\r\nand his little army would have been victors instead of prisoners.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol. VII., Chap.\r\nlxiv., pp. 177, 178.\r\n\r\n\"The officers were to retain their side arms and private property of\r\nevery kind, but all property obviously belonging to inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States to be subject to be reclaimed; the soldiers to be supplied\r\nwith the same rations as were allowed to soldiers in the service of\r\nCongress. Cornwallis endeavoured to obtain permission for the British\r\nand German troops to return to their respective countries, under no\r\nother restrictions than an engagement not to serve against France or\r\nAmerica. He also tried to obtain an indemnity for those of the\r\ninhabitants who had joined him; but he was obliged to recede from the\r\nformer, and also to consent that the loyalists in his camp should be\r\ngiven up to the unconditional mercy of their countrymen. His lordship,\r\nnevertheless, obtained (from Washington) permission for the _Bonetta_\r\nsloop of war to pass unexamined to New York. This gave an opportunity of\r\nscreening such of the loyalists as were most obnoxious to the\r\nAmericans.\" (Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxxv., pp. 454, 455.)\r\n\r\n\"The regular troops of France and America, employed in this siege,\r\nconsisted of about 7,000 of the former (besides ships and seamen), and\r\n5,500 of the latter; and they were assisted by about 4,000 militia. The\r\ntroops of every kind that surrendered prisoners of war were about 7,000;\r\nbut so great was the number of the sick and wounded, that there were\r\nonly 3,800 capable of bearing arms.\"--_Ib._, p. 455.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: During the discussion on this question, it had been argued\r\nthat the Americans are fed, clothed, and paid by France; they are led on\r\nby French officers; the French and the American armies are incorporated\r\ninto one; it was merely a locality that should give name to a war.\r\nFrance had formerly been fought with success in Germany, and there could\r\nbe no solid objection to fighting her in America. General Conway argued\r\nthat French troops did not cost more than £40 per man a year, while the\r\nexpense of the English troops cost £100 per man a year. General Conway\r\nreminded the House that though seventy-three thousand men were voted and\r\npaid for, we had never above half that number in actual service.\r\nGovernment had, therefore, only to complete the regiments, and they\r\nwould have more men in America than ever they had before. (Annual\r\nRegister of Parliament for 1782, pp. 158-161.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Annual Register of Parliament for 1782, Vol. XXIX., p.\r\n173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Abridged from the Parliamentary Register for 1782, Vol.\r\nXXV., Chap. vii. See also Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol.\r\nVII., Chap. lxv.\r\n\r\nLord Mahon concludes his account of this Administration as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Thus ended Lord North's Administration of twelve years. It is certainly\r\nstrange, on contemplating these twelve years, to find so many harsh and\r\nrigorous measures proceed from the most gentle and good-humoured of\r\nPrime Ministers. Happy, had but greater firmness in maintaining his own\r\nopinions been joined to so much ability in defending opinions even when\r\nnot his own.\r\n\r\n\"Even as to the disasters and miscarriages, however, which could not be\r\ndenied in his Administration, the friends of Lord North contended that\r\nin truth he was not answerable for them. The points in his favour were\r\nargued a few days before his fall by Mr. George Onslow in the House of\r\nCommons. 'Why,' said Mr. Onslow, 'have we in this war with America such\r\nill success? Mainly,' he continued, 'from the support and countenance\r\ngiven in that House to American rebellion. The army of Washington had\r\nbeen called by the Opposition \"our army;\" the cause of the Americans had\r\nbeen called \"the cause of liberty;\" and one gentleman (this was Mr.\r\nBurke), while lavishing his praises on Dr. Franklin and Mr. Laurens, had\r\ndeclared he would prefer a prison with them to freedom in company with\r\nthose who were supporting the cause of England.' But this vindication,\r\nthough spirited, nay, though true, is faulty; because, though true, it\r\nis not the whole truth; because it overlooks what no statesman\r\nshould--the certainty that when free principles are at stake,\r\ndissensions will always arise in a free country.\"--_Ib._, pp. 209, 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: I have not a shadow of doubt, that had the leaders in\r\nCongress adhered to their pretensions of contending and fighting for\r\nBritish constitutional rights, as aforetime, instead of renouncing those\r\nrights and declaring Independence in 1776, the changes which took place\r\nin the Administration in England in 1783 would have taken place in 1777;\r\nfor the corrupt Administration showed as strong symptoms of decline, and\r\nwas as manifestly \"tottering to its fall\" in the parliamentary session\r\nwhich commenced in 1776, as it did in the session which commenced in\r\n1782. In both cases its predictions and assured successes had been\r\ncompletely falsified; in both cases the indignation of the nation was\r\naroused against the Administration, and the confidence of Parliament was\r\non the point of being withdrawn in 1776-77, as it was withdrawn in the\r\nsession of 1782-83; but in 1776, the Congress, instead of adhering to\r\nits heretofore professed principles, was induced by its leaders, as\r\nrelated in Chapter xxvi., to renounce its former principles; to falsify\r\nall its former professions to its advocates in England and\r\nfellow-subjects in America; to renounce the maintenance of the\r\nconstitutional rights of British subjects; to adopt a Declaration of\r\nIndependence, of eternal separation from England; to extinguish the\r\nnational life of the British empire and the unity of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace, and seek an alliance with their own and Great Britain's hereditary\r\nenemies for a war upon their mother country, which had protected them\r\nfor a hundred years against the French and Spaniards, who had also\r\nemployed and rewarded the Indians to destroy them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION IN ENGLAND--CHANGE OF POLICY FOR BOTH ENGLAND\r\nAND THE COLONIES--PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AT PARIS--THE CAUSE OF THE UNITED\r\nEMPIRE LOYALISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the adjournment of Parliament from the 24th to the 28th of March,\r\nthe new Administration was formed, and announced in the Commons on the\r\n28th, when the House adjourned over the Easter holidays, to give time\r\nfor the re-election of such members as had accepted office. The King\r\nfirst sent for the Earl of Shelburne to form a new Administration,\r\nnaming some members of it; but the Earl of Shelburne declined, as unable\r\nto form an Administration upon such conditions, and recommended the King\r\nto send for the Marquis of Rockingham. The King refused to see\r\nRockingham face to face, but requested Shelburne to be the bearer of a\r\nmessage to him; but Shelburne only consented on the condition of \"full\r\npower and full confidence.\" \"Necessity,\" relates the King, \"made me\r\nyield to the advice of Lord Shelburne.\" Before accepting the offer of\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury, the Marquis of Rockingham, without\r\nneglecting some minor matters, stipulated that there should be no veto\r\nto the independence of America.[58] But it was nearly three months\r\nbefore an Act passed the Commons authorizing peace with America, and\r\nthe acknowledgment of American Independence, and it was nearly a year\r\nbefore the treaty for that purpose was agreed upon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, \"Immediately before the fall of Lord North's Ministry,\r\nin anticipation of that event, Dr. Franklin had written from Paris to\r\nLord Shelburne with general expressions of his pacific views. On\r\nreceiving that letter, Lord Shelburne, then Secretary of State, sent to\r\nParis, as agent, Mr. Richard Oswald, a London merchant well versed in\r\nAmerican affairs. Dr. Franklin readily conferred with Mr. Oswald, and\r\nput into his hands a paper drawn up by himself, suggesting that, in\r\norder to produce a thorough reconciliation, and to prevent any future\r\nquarrel on the North American continent, England should not only\r\nacknowledge the thirteen united States, but concede to them the Province\r\nof Canada. Such a project was not likely to find favour in the eyes of\r\nany British statesman. Mr. Oswald, however, undertook to return to\r\nEngland and lay it before his chief, Dr. Franklin, at his departure,\r\nexpressing an earnest hope that all future communications to himself\r\nmight pass through the same hands.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances, the Cabinet determined that Mr. Oswald\r\nshould go back to France and carry on the treaty with Franklin, though\r\nby no means with such concessions as the American philosopher\r\ndesired.\"[59]\r\n\r\nAfter the termination of hostilities between Great Britain and the\r\ncolonies, the American Commissioners evinced a desire to treat with\r\nEngland alone. Mr. Oswald, as early as July, 1782, wrote privately to\r\nLord Shelburne, \"The Commissioners of the colonies have shown a desire\r\nto treat and to end with us on a separate footing from the other\r\nPowers.\" \"The separate negotiation thus arising was delayed,\" says Lord\r\nMahon, \"first by the severe illness of Dr. Franklin, and next by some\r\npoints of form in the commission of Mr. Oswald. When at length the more\r\nsolid part of the negotiation was commenced, the hints of Franklin for\r\nthe cession of Canada were quietly dropped, with greater case from their\r\nhaving been transmitted in a confidential form. It is also worthy of\r\nnote that Lord Shelburne prevailed, in his desire of acknowledging the\r\nindependence of the United States, by an article of the treaty, and not,\r\nas Mr. Fox had wished, by a previous declaration.\"\r\n\r\nThe two most difficult questions of the treaty related to the fishing\r\ngrounds of Newfoundland, and the Loyalists or \"Tories,\" as they were\r\ncalled. The English were unwilling to concede the use of the fishing\r\ngrounds, but the Americans were firm; the result was, that by the\r\nprovisions of the treaty it was agreed that the Americans should have\r\nthe right to take fish on the banks of Newfoundland, but not to dry or\r\ncure them on any of the King's settled dominions.[60]\r\n\r\nBut the question which transcended all others in importance, with which\r\nthis work has chiefly to do, was that of the Loyalists--a class which,\r\nby the testimony of American historians themselves, constituted, at the\r\nbeginning of the war, a majority of the population of the colonies.\r\nTheir numbers had been greatly reduced from various causes during the\r\nwar; they had been plundered and scattered by the alternate ascendancy\r\nof opposite parties; they had all of them suffered in their property and\r\nliberty; many of them had suffered imprisonment, and not a few of them\r\nhad been executed as criminals for preferring their oath of allegiance\r\nand connection with the mother country to a renunciation of their former\r\nprofession of faith, and absolute submission to a newly self-created\r\nauthority of rule and a new political creed. At the conclusion of the\r\nwar, and in the treaty of peace, \"the question of Loyalists or Tories,\"\r\nsays Lord Mahon, \"was, as it ought to be, a main object with the British\r\nGovernment to obtain, if possible, some restitution to the men who, in\r\npunishment for their continued allegiance to the King, had found their\r\nproperty confiscated and their persons banished. But from the first Dr.\r\nFranklin held out no hopes of any satisfaction on that point. 'The\r\nCommissioners,' he said, 'had no such power, nor had even Congress.'[61]\r\nThey were willing that Congress should, with certain modifications,\r\nrecommend those indemnities to the several States; and, as one of the\r\nnegotiators from England tells us, they to the last 'continued to assert\r\nthat the recommendation of Congress would have the effect we proposed.'\r\nThe British diplomatists persevered in their original demand, and at one\r\ntime there seemed a probability that the negotiations might break off,\r\nchiefly on this ground. Twice was Mr. Strachey, the Undersecretary of\r\nState, an able and experienced man, dispatched to Paris to aid Mr.\r\nOswald with his counsel and co-operation. But at last the mind of\r\nFranklin, ever ingenious and fertile of resources, devised a counter\r\nscheme. He said that he would allow the losses which the Loyalists had\r\nsuffered, provided another account were opened of the mischief they had\r\ndone, as of slaves carried off, or houses burned; new Commissioners to\r\nbe appointed to strike a balance between the two computations. At this\r\nformidable proposal, involving an endless train of discussions and\r\ndisputes, the negotiators from England finally gave way.\"[62]\r\n\r\nThis account of the negotiation in regard to the United Empire\r\nLoyalists, taken from Lord Mahon's impartial history, is corroborated in\r\nall essential particulars by American historians. Mr. Bancroft says that\r\n\"Franklin having already explained that nothing could be done for the\r\nLoyalists by the United States, as their estates had been confiscated by\r\nlaws of particular States, which Congress had no power to repeal, he\r\nfurther demonstrates that Great Britain had forfeited every right to\r\nintercede for them by its conduct and example, to which end he read to\r\nOswald the orders of the British in Carolina for confiscating and\r\nselling the lands and property of all patriots under the direction of\r\nthe military; and he declared definitely that, though the separate\r\ngovernments might show compassion where it was deserved, the American\r\nCommissioners for Peace could not make compensation of refugees a part\r\nof the treaty.\"\r\n\r\n\"This last demand (adequate indemnity for the confiscated property of\r\nloyal refugees) touched alike the sympathy and the sense of honour of\r\nEngland. The previous answer, that the Commissioners had no power to\r\ntreat on the business of the Loyalists, was regarded as an allegation\r\nthat though they claimed to have full power, they were not\r\nplenipotentiaries; that they were acting under thirteen separate\r\nsovereignties, which had no common head. To meet the exigence, Shelburne\r\nproposed either an extension of Nova Scotia to the Penobscot, or\r\nKennebec, or the Saco, so that a province might be formed for the\r\nreception of Loyalists; or that a part of the money to be received from\r\nsales of the Ohio lands might be applied to their subsistence.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 29th of November, 1782, Strachey, Oswald, and Fitzherbert, on\r\nthe one side, and Jay, Franklin, Adams, and for the first time Laurens,\r\non the other, came together for their last word at the apartments of\r\nJay. The American Commissioners agreed that there should be no future\r\nconfiscations nor prosecutions of Loyalists, that all pending\r\nprosecutions should be discontinued, and that Congress should recommend\r\nto the several States and their Legislatures, on behalf of refugees,\r\namnesty and the restitution of their confiscated property.\" \"On the\r\n30th, the Commissioners of both countries signed and sealed fair copies\r\nof the Convention.\" \"The treaty was not a compromise, nor a compact\r\nimposed by force, but a free and perfect solution and perpetual\r\nsettlement of all that had been called in question.\"[63]\r\n\r\nDr. Ramsay observes: \"From the necessity of the case, the Loyalists were\r\nsacrificed, nothing further than a simple recommendation for restitution\r\nbeing stipulated in their favour. * * The case of the Loyalists was\r\nundoubtedly a hard one, but unavoidable from the complex Constitution of\r\nthe United States. The American Ministers engaged, as far as they were\r\nauthorized, and Congress did all they constitutionally could; but this\r\nwas no more than simply to recommend their case to the several States,\r\nfor the purpose of making them restitution. To have insisted on more,\r\nunder such circumstances, would have been equivalent to saying that\r\nthere should be no peace. It is true, much more was expected from the\r\nrecommendations of Congress than resulted from them; but this was not\r\nthe consequence of deception, but of misunderstanding the principles of\r\nthe confederation. In conformity to the letter and spirit of the treaty,\r\nCongress urged, in strong terms, the propriety of making restitution to\r\nthe Loyalists, but to procure it was beyond their power. * * There were\r\ndoubtless among the Loyalists many worthy characters, friends of peace\r\nand lovers of justice. To such restitution was undoubtedly due, and to\r\nmany such it was made; but it is one of the many calamities incident to\r\nwar, that the innocent, from the impossibility of discrimination, are\r\noften involved in the same distress with the guilty.\r\n\r\n\"The return of the Loyalists to their former places of residence was as\r\nmuch disrelished by the Whig citizens of America as the proposal for\r\nreimbursing their confiscated property. In sundry places Committees were\r\nformed, who, in an arbitrary manner, opposed their peaceable residence.\r\nThe sober and dispassionate citizens exerted themselves in checking\r\nthese irregular measures; but such was the violence of party spirit, and\r\nso relaxed were the sinews of government, that, in opposition to legal\r\nauthority and the private interference of the judicious and moderate,\r\nmany indecent outrages were committed on the persons and property of the\r\nreturning Loyalists.\r\n\r\n\"Nor were these all the sufferings of those Americans who had attached\r\nthemselves to the royal cause. Being compelled to depart from their\r\nnative country, many of them were obliged to take up their abodes in the\r\ninhospitable wilds of Nova Scotia, or on the barren shores of the Bahama\r\nIslands. Parliamentary relief was extended to them; but this was\r\nobtained with difficulty, and distributed with a partial hand. Some, who\r\ninvented plausible tales of loyalty and distress, received much more\r\nthan they ever possessed; while others, less artful, were not half\r\nreimbursed for their actual losses.\"[64]\r\n\r\nMr. Hildreth remarks, under date of September, 1783, \"that at New York a\r\ngeneral release of prisoners had taken place on both sides; but the\r\nnecessity of finding transports for the numerous Loyalists assembled\r\nthere protracted the evacuation of New York. In consequence of laws\r\nstill in force against them, several thousand American Loyalists found\r\nit necessary to abandon their country. A considerable portion of these\r\nexiles belonged to the wealthier classes; they had been officials,\r\nmerchants, large landholders, conspicuous members of the colonial\r\naristocracy. Those from the North settled principally in Nova Scotia or\r\nCanada, provinces the politics of which their descendants continued to\r\ncontrol until quite recently. Those from the South found refuge in the\r\nBahamas and other West India islands. Still objects of great popular\r\nodium, the Loyalists had little to expect from the stipulated\r\nrecommendations of Congress in their favour. Some of the States, whose\r\nterritory had been longest and most recently occupied by the enemy, were\r\neven inclined to enact new confiscations.\"[65]\r\n\r\nIn each and all of these historical statements it is clearly admitted\r\nthat the claim of the Loyalists to compensation for loss of property was\r\nfounded in equity, as well as in national policy. This is sanctioned by\r\nthe admission of the American Commissioners and the recommendation of\r\nCongress. The want of power in Congress to do what is admitted to be an\r\nact of justice to the Loyalists is the plea for not restoring them the\r\nproperty which had gone into the hands of their opponents, who were\r\nproportionally enriched thereby. It was left to local avarice and local\r\nresentment to deal with the property of banished exiles.\r\n\r\nWhat was claimed by and in behalf of the Loyalists accorded with the\r\npractice of even modern nations, as well as with the sentiments of\r\nhumanity. When the Dutch provinces asserted their independence of Spain,\r\nand after a long and bloody war obtained the recognition of it, they\r\ncordially agreed to an act of oblivion, and even restored to those who\r\nhad adhered to the cause of Spain, their property of every denomination\r\nthat had been confiscated, or the full value of it. Even Spain herself\r\nhad twice thus acted towards the province of Catalonia--first, on its\r\nrevolting from that Crown, and calling in the assistance of France; and\r\nsecondly, on its refusing to acknowledge the Bourbon family, at the\r\nbeginning of the last century. Though the inhabitants had forfeited life\r\nand property, yet, on their return to obedience, life, possessions, laws\r\nand immunities remained inviolate. England had conducted herself in the\r\nsame spirit towards that party in Ireland which had taken up arms in\r\nsupport of James the Second. No proscriptions took place, and every man,\r\non submitting to Government, was admitted to the undisturbed enjoyment\r\nof his property. Had this spirit actuated, and these examples, with many\r\nothers of like character, influenced the Americans, how much more\r\nhonourable to them, and more consistent with sound policy, to efface at\r\nonce all remembrance of internal discords, than to pursue, in the\r\nexecrable spirit of revenge and avarice, those of their countrymen who\r\ndiffered from them in opinion in the late contest, and sided with Great\r\nBritain.[66] That the plea that Congress had no power in granting\r\namnesty and compensation to the Loyalists was a mere pretext, is\r\nmanifest from the fact that the Commissioners agreed that there should\r\nbe no more confiscations or proscriptions against the Loyalists; for if\r\nthe laws under which these prosecutions were instituted and\r\nconfiscations made were State laws, with which Congress had no power to\r\ninterfere, how could the Congress Commissioners stipulate that there\r\nshould be no more confiscations or proscriptions?\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin, the most experienced and ablest of the American\r\ndiplomatists, was the most crafty and overbearing against England. At\r\nthe beginning of the negotiations for peace, he demurely proposed, and\r\nhalf converted Mr. Oswald to his proposition, to concede Canada (which\r\nat that time meant all British North America) to the United States,\r\nthough his commission related simply to the independency of the thirteen\r\ncolonies; and when the British Cabinet vetoed this extra-official and\r\nextravagant proposition, Dr. Franklin and his colleagues overreached the\r\nignorance and weakness of the British diplomatists by carefully\r\nconstructed maps for the purpose of making the boundary lines between\r\nthe proposed possessions of Great Britain and the United States on their\r\nnorthern and north-western frontiers. These lines were so ingeniously\r\ndrawn as to take from Great Britain and include in the United States the\r\nimmense and valuable territories, back settlements, and the whole\r\ncountry between the Alleghany Mountains and the Mississippi, and which\r\nhave since become the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,\r\nWisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, etc.--to not one foot of which\r\nthe thirteen American colonies had the slightest claim--territories\r\nample to compensate Loyalists for their losses and banishment, but whose\r\ninterests, together with these most valuable possessions, were lost to\r\nGreat Britain by the subserviency of the British Commissioner, Oswald (a\r\nLondon and American merchant), who looked to his own interests, and was\r\nthe subservient tool and echo of Dr. Franklin. The above territories\r\nwere a part of the domain of Congress, irrespective of any State, and\r\ntherefore at the absolute disposal of Congress. Yet, with these immense\r\naccessions of resources, the American Commissioners professed that the\r\nCongress had no power or means to compensate the United Empire Loyalists\r\nfor the confiscation and destruction of their property! One knows not at\r\nwhich most to marvel--the boldness, skill, and success of the American\r\nCommissioners, or the cowardice, ignorance, and recklessness of the\r\nBritish diplomatists.\r\n\r\nThe result of these negotiations was, that the adherents to Great\r\nBritain during the civil war were deprived of the amnesty and\r\nrestoration of property upon any ground of right, as had been granted at\r\nthe termination of civil strife by all civilized nations--to the\r\nrestoration of what had been taken from them during the war--and turned\r\nover as suppliant culprits to the several States by whose laws their\r\nproperty had been confiscated, and themselves declared guilty of\r\ntreason, and condemned to the death of traitors. Dr. Franklin, in the\r\nbeginning of his negotiations, had proposed to give all that now\r\nconstitutes British North America to the United States, and thus leave\r\nto the British Loyalists not an inch of ground on which to place their\r\nfeet; but all that was now left to them, as far as America was\r\nconcerned, was to prostrate themselves as suppliants before the\r\nLegislatures of the several States, each of which was for the most part\r\na seething cauldron of passion and resentment against them.[67]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: The new Cabinet was composed as follows: The Marquis of\r\nRockingham, First Commissioner of the Treasury; the Earl of Shelburne\r\nand Mr. Fox, Secretaries of State; Lord Camden, President of the\r\nCouncil; Duke of Grafton, Privy Seal; Lord John Cavendish, Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer; Admiral Keppel, raised to be a Viscount, First\r\nCommissioner of the Admiralty; General Conway, Commander of the Forces;\r\nDuke of Richmond, Master General of the Ordnance. Lord Thurlow was\r\ncontinued in the office of Lord High Chancellor, and Mr. Dunning raised\r\nto the peerage under the title of Lord Ashburton, as Chancellor of the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster. Mr. Burke was not made a member of the Cabinet, but\r\nwas appointed to the lucrative office of Paymaster of the Forces, and\r\nwas further gratified by the appointment of his son to a small office.\r\n\r\nAbout six months after the formation of the new Cabinet the Marquis of\r\nRockingham died, and the Earl of Shelburne was appointed to succeed him,\r\nwhen the Duke of Richmond, Mr. Fox, and Lord John Cavendish seceded from\r\nthe Cabinet, and were succeeded by Mr. Thomas Townsend and Lord Graham\r\nas Secretaries of State, while the place of Lord John Cavendish, as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, was more than filled by Mr. Pitt.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol. VII., Chap\r\nlxvi., pp. 265, 266.\r\n\r\n\"At Paris, the negotiations had been much impeded by the resignation of\r\nMr. Fox and the return of Grenville. These events had, in many minds,\r\ncast a shade of doubt over the true intentions of the British\r\nGovernment. Lord Shelburne, however, renewed the most pacific\r\nassurances, sending to Paris, in place of Mr. Grenville and conjointly\r\nwith Mr. Oswald, Mr. Alleyne Fitzherbert, well known in after years as\r\nLord St. Helens. These gentlemen acted in amity and concert with each\r\nother, although, strictly speaking, negotiation with America was, as\r\nbefore, the province of Mr. Oswald, and negotiation with the European\r\nPowers the province of Mr. Fitzherbert. Dr. Franklin, on the other hand,\r\nhad associated with him three other American Commissioners, arriving in\r\nsuccession--first, Mr. Jay, from Spain; then Mr. Adams, from Holland;\r\nand finally, Mr. Laurens, from London.\r\n\r\n\"It became, ere long, apparent to the British agents that the Courts of\r\nFrance and Spain were by no means earnest and sincere in the wish for an\r\nimmediate close of the war. With the hope of soon reducing Gibraltar, or\r\nof otherwise depressing England, they put forward at this time either\r\ninadmissible pretensions, or vague and ambiguous words. It therefore\r\nbecame an object of great importance to negotiate, if possible, a\r\nseparate pacification with America. At first sight there appeared almost\r\ninsuperable difficulties in the way of such a scheme. The treaty of\r\nalliance of February, 1778, between France and the United States,\r\nstipulated in the most positive terms that neither party should conclude\r\na peace or truce with England, unless with the consent of the other\r\nparty first obtained. Since that time the French, far from falling short\r\nof their engagement, had gone much beyond it. To say nothing of their\r\ndespatch of a fleet and army, and besides their annual loans and\r\nadvances to the United States, they had made, in 1781, a free gift of\r\nsix millions of livres, and in the spring of 1782 granted another to the\r\nsame amount.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, however, there was a strong temptation to treat\r\nwithout delay. War, if still waged, would be mainly for French and\r\nSpanish purposes. It could be made clear that when the independence of\r\nthe Americans was fully established and secured, they had no interest\r\nanymore than England in continuing an unprofitable contest.\"--_Ib._, pp.\r\n291-293.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, there had sprung up in the minds of the American\r\nCommissioners at Paris a strong feeling of distrust and suspicion\r\nagainst their new allies. That feeling we find most plainly expressed by\r\nMr. Adams in relating his own conversations with Mr. Oswald. 'You are\r\nafraid,' said Mr. Oswald to-day, 'of being made the tools of the Powers\r\nof Europe?' 'Indeed I am,' said I. 'What Powers?' said he. 'All of\r\nthem,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"But in the minds of the American Commissioners, the distrust against\r\nFrance was more vehement than against any other State. The best American\r\nwriters of the present day acknowledge that all surmises thence arising\r\nwere, in truth, ill-founded; that the conduct of France towards the\r\nUnited States had been marked throughout not only by good faith and\r\nhonour, but by generosity.\" (Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol.\r\nVII., Chap. lxvi., pp. 293, 294.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: In the preamble of the treaty, it was provided that \"The\r\ntreaty was not to be concluded until terms of peace shall be agreed upon\r\nbetween Great Britain and France.\" By this limitation (which was a mere\r\nform, as the provisional articles were to be meanwhile binding and\r\neffective), the Americans were in hopes of avoiding, at least of\r\nsoftening, their French allies. \"The first Article acknowledged in the\r\nfullest terms the independence of the United States. The second fixed\r\ntheir boundaries, and certainly to their advantage. The third gave their\r\npeople the right to take fish on all the banks of Newfoundland, but not\r\nto dry or cure them on any of the King's settled dominions in America.\r\nBy the fourth, fifth, and sixth Articles, it was engaged that Congress\r\nshould earnestly recommend to the several Legislatures to provide for\r\nthe restitution of all estates belonging to real British subjects who\r\nhad not borne arms against them. All other persons were to be at liberty\r\nto go to any of the provinces and remain there for twelve months to wind\r\nup their affairs, the Congress also recommending the restitution of\r\ntheir confiscated property, on their repayment of the sums for which\r\nthey had been sold. No impediment was to be put in the way of recovering\r\n_bona fide_ debts; no further prosecutions were to be commenced, no\r\nfurther confiscations made. It was likewise stipulated in the seventh\r\nand eighth Articles, that the English should at once withdraw their\r\nfleets and armies from every port or place which they still possessed\r\nwithin the limits of the United States; and that the navigation of the\r\nMississippi, from its source to the ocean, should be for ever free and\r\nopen to both parties.\" (Lord Mahon's History, etc., Vol. VII., Chap.\r\nlxvi., pp. 297, 298.)\r\n\r\n\"It is not to be supposed that the French Government could view with\r\nunconcern the studied secrecy of this negotiation. The appearances of\r\namity were, indeed, for the sake of mutual interest, kept up on either\r\nside. But thus did the Comte de Vergennes (the French Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs) unbosom himself in writing to the French Minister at\r\nPhiladelphia: 'You will surely be gratified, as well as myself, with the\r\nvery extensive advantages which our allies, the Americans, are to\r\nreceive from the peace; but you certainly will not be less surprised\r\nthan I have been with the conduct of the commissioners. * * They have\r\ncautiously kept themselves at a distance from me. Whenever I have had\r\noccasion to see any one of them, and enquire of them briefly respecting\r\nthe progress of the negotiation, they have constantly clothed their\r\nspeech in generalities, giving me to understand that it did not go\r\nforward, and that they had no confidence in the sincerity of the British\r\nMinistry. Judge of my surprise when, on the 30th of November, Dr.\r\nFranklin informed me that Articles were signed. The reservation retained\r\non our account does not save the infraction of the promise which we have\r\nmade to each other, not to sign except conjointly. * * This negotiation\r\nhas not yet so far advanced in regard to ourselves as that of the United\r\nStates; not but what the King, if he had shown as little delicacy in his\r\nproceedings as the American Commissioners, might have signed articles\r\nwith England long before them.'\"--_Ib._, pp. 298, 299.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: It was self-contradictory to say that Congress had power\r\nto confiscate property, and yet had no power to restore it when\r\nconfiscated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol. VII., Chap.\r\nlxvi., pp 295, 296.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: History of the United States, Vol. X., Chap, xxix., pp.\r\n555, 583, 589, 590, 591.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap,\r\nxxvii., pp. 489, 490, 491.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. III., Chap,\r\nxlv., p. 439.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The royal historian, Dr. Andrews, remarks strongly on this\r\nsubject as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The demands of restitution to the Loyalists of their property\r\nconfiscated during the war, for their attachment to our cause, had been\r\nrefused by the American Commissioners, on pretence that neither they,\r\nnor Congress itself, could comply with it, any farther than by\r\nrecommendation of it to the different States. The demand was in itself\r\nso just, and founded on so many historical precedents, that Congress\r\ncould not possibly plead a want of foresight that it would be made. It\r\nhad been usual in all ages, on the cessation of civil war, to grant a\r\ngeneral amnesty. No other motive but that of the basest and most\r\nbarbarous revenge could induce men to express an averseness to so humane\r\nand necessary a measure. Next to the cruelty of such a refusal was the\r\nmeanness of those who submitted to it.\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances empowered this nation to have acted with such firmness as\r\nto compel the Americans to relax their obstinacy in this particular.\r\nUntil they had consented to a generous treatment of the Loyalists, we\r\nought to have withheld the restitution of the many strong places still\r\nremaining in our hands, and made the surrender of them the price of\r\ntheir acquiescence in our demands in favour of the brave and faithful\r\npeople who had suffered so much on our account.\" (Dr. Andrews' History\r\nof the Late War, Vol. IV., pp. 401, 402.)\r\n\r\n\"All parties in the Commons unanimously demanded amnesty and indemnity\r\nfor the Loyalists.\" (Bancroft, Vol. X., Chap, xxix., p. 586.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Dr. Ramsay justly remarks: \"The operation of treason laws\r\nadded to the calamities of the war. Individuals on both sides, while\r\nthey were doing no more than they supposed to be their duty, were\r\ninvolved in the penal consequences of capital crimes. The Americans, in\r\nconformity to the usual policy of nations, demanded the allegiance of\r\nall who resided among them; but many preferred the late royal\r\ngovernment, and were disposed, when opportunity offered, to support it.\r\nWhile they acted in conformity to these sentiments, the laws enacted for\r\nthe security of the new government condemned them to death. Of all wars,\r\ncivil are most to be dreaded. They are attended with the bitterest of\r\nresentments, and produce the greatest quantity of human woes. In the\r\nAmerican war the distresses of the country were greatly aggravated from\r\nthe circumstance that every man was obliged, some way or other, to be in\r\nthe public service. In Europe, where the military operations are carried\r\non by armies hired and paid for the purpose, the common people partake\r\nbut little of the calamities of the war; but in America, where the whole\r\npeople were enrolled as a militia, and where both sides endeavoured to\r\nstrengthen themselves by oaths and by laws, denouncing the penalties of\r\ntreason on those who aided or abetted the opposite party, the sufferings\r\nof individuals were renewed as often as fortune varied her standard.\r\nEach side claimed the co-operation of the inhabitants, and was ready to\r\npunish them when it was withheld.\r\n\r\n\"In the first institution of the American governments the boundaries of\r\nauthority were not properly fixed. Committees exercised legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial powers. It is not to be doubted that in many\r\ninstances these were improperly used, and that private resentments were\r\noften covered under the specious veil of patriotism. The sufferers, in\r\npassing over to the Loyalists, carried with them a keen remembrance of\r\nthe vengeance of Committees, and when opportunity presented were tempted\r\nto retaliate. From the nature of the case, the original offenders were\r\nless frequently the objects of retaliation than those who were entirely\r\ninnocent. One instance of severity begat another, and they continued to\r\nincrease in a proportion that doubled the evils of common war. * * The\r\nRoyalists raised the cry of persecution, and loudly complained that,\r\nmerely for supporting the Government under which they were born, and to\r\nwhich they owed a natural allegiance, they were doomed to suffer all the\r\npenalties of capital offenders. Those of them who acted from principle\r\nfelt no consciousness of guilt, and could not but look with abhorrence\r\nupon a Government which could inflict such severe punishments for what\r\nthey deemed a laudable line of conduct. Humanity would shudder at a\r\nparticular recital of the calamities which the Whigs inflicted on the\r\nTories and the Tories on the Whigs. It is particularly remarkable, that\r\nmany on both sides consoled themselves with the belief that they were\r\nacting and suffering in a good cause.\" (History of the United States,\r\nVol. II., Chap. xxvi., pp. 467, 468, 469.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF REPUBLICANISM AND HATRED OF MONARCHY IN AMERICA--THOMAS PAINE:\r\nA SKETCH OF HIS LIFE, CHARACTER, AND WRITINGS, AND THEIR EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo social or political phenomenon in the history of nations has been\r\nmore remarkable than the sudden transition of the great body of the\r\nAmerican colonists, in 1776, from a reverence and love of monarchical\r\ninstitutions and of England, in which they had been trained from their\r\nforefathers, to a renunciation of those institutions and a hatred of\r\nEngland. Whatever influence the oppressive policy of the British\r\nAdministration may have had in producing this change, was confined to\r\ncomparatively few in America, was little known to the masses, and had\r\nlittle influence over them. This sudden and marvellous revolution in the\r\nAmerican mind was produced chiefly by a pamphlet of forty pages, written\r\nat the suggestion of two or three leaders of the American\r\nrevolutionists, over the signature of \"An Englishman.\" This Englishman\r\nwas no other than Thomas Paine, better known in after years as Tom\r\nPaine, \"the blasphemous infidel and beastly drunkard,\" as the New York\r\n_Observer_, in answer to a challenge, proved him to be beyond the\r\npossibility of successful contradiction. Tom Paine was of a Quaker\r\nfamily; was a staymaker by trade, but an agitator by occupation. He had\r\nobtained an appointment as exciseman, but was dismissed from his office,\r\nand emigrated to America in 1774. He somehow obtained an introduction to\r\nDr. Franklin in London, who gave him a letter of introduction to a\r\ngentleman in Philadelphia, through whom he procured employment in the\r\nservice of a bookseller. Beginning forthwith to write for a leading\r\nnewspaper on the agitated questions of the day, his articles attracted\r\nattention and procured him the acquaintance of some influential persons,\r\nand he at length became editor of the \"Pennsylvania Magazine.\" He was\r\nthe master of a singularly attractive, lucid, and vituperative style,\r\nscarcely inferior to that of _Junius_ himself. At the suggestion of\r\nFranklin and one or two other leaders of the revolution, he wrote a\r\npamphlet of forty pages in favour of Independence, entitled \"Common\r\nSense,\" and over the signature of \"An Englishman,\" yet bitter against\r\nEngland and English institutions. It was addressed to the inhabitants of\r\nAmerica, and was arranged under four heads: first, \"Of the origin and\r\ndesign of government in general, with concise remarks on the English\r\nConstitution;\" secondly, \"Of monarchy and hereditary succession;\"\r\nthirdly, \"Thoughts on the present state of military affairs;\" fourth,\r\n\"Of the present ability of America, with some miscellaneous\r\nreflections.\" Mr. Frothingham says: \"The portion on Government has\r\nlittle of permanent value; the glance at the English Constitution is\r\nsuperficial; and the attack on Monarchy is coarse. The treatment of the\r\nAmerican question under the two last heads gave the pamphlet its\r\ncelebrity.\"[68]\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon says that \"No publication so much promoted the cause of\r\nIndependence as that. The statements which are now adopted were then\r\nstrange, and Paine found difficulty in procuring a publisher to\r\nundertake it.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Ramsay says: \"The style, manner, and language of Thomas Paine's\r\nperformance were calculated to interest the passions and to rouse all\r\nthe active powers of human nature. With the view of operating on the\r\nsentiments of religious people, Scripture was pressed into his service;\r\nand the powers and name of a king were rendered odious in the eyes of\r\nnumerous colonists who had read and studied the history of the Jews, as\r\nrecorded in the Old Testament. Hereditary succession was turned into\r\nridicule. The absurdity of subjecting a great continent to a small\r\nisland on the other side of the globe was represented in such striking\r\nlanguage as to interest the honour and pride of the colonists in\r\nrenouncing the government of Great Britain. The necessity, the advantage\r\nand practicability of independence were forcibly demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be better timed than this performance. It was addressed\r\nto freemen, who had just received convincing proof that Great Britain\r\nhad thrown them out of her protection, and engaged foreign mercenaries\r\nto make war upon them, and seriously designed to compel their\r\nunconditional submission to her unlimited power. It found the colonists\r\nmost thoroughly alarmed for their liberties, and disposed to do and\r\nsuffer anything that promised their establishment. In union with the\r\nfeelings and sentiments of the people, it produced surprising effects.\r\nMany thousands were convinced, and were led to approve and long for a\r\nseparation from the mother country. Though that measure, a few months\r\nbefore, was not only foreign to their wishes, but the object of their\r\nabhorrence, the current suddenly became so strong in its favour that it\r\nbore down all opposition. The multitude was hurried down the stream; but\r\nsome worthy men could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea of an\r\neternal separation from a country to which they had long been bound by\r\nthe most endearing ties. * * The change of the public mind of America\r\nrespecting connection with Great Britain is without a parallel. In the\r\nshort space of two years, nearly three millions of people passed over\r\nfrom the love and duty of loyal subjects to the hatred and resentment of\r\nenemies.\"[69]\r\n\r\nThe American press and all the American historians of that day speak of\r\nthe electric and marvellous influence of Tom Paine's appeal against\r\nkings, against monarchy, against England, and in favour of American\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks of the London _Athenæum_ are quoted by the New\r\nYork _Observer_ of the 10th of April, 1879:\r\n\r\n\"A more despicable man than Tom Paine cannot be found among the ready\r\nwriters of the eighteenth century. He sold himself to the highest\r\nbidder, and he could be bought at a very low price. He wrote well;\r\nsometimes as pointedly as Junius or Cobbett (who had his bones brought\r\nto England). Neither excelled him in coining telling and mischievous\r\nphrases; neither surpassed him in popularity-hunting. He had the art,\r\nwhich was almost equal to genius, of giving happy titles to his\r\nproductions. When he denounced the British Government in the name of\r\n'Common Sense,' he found willing readers in the rebellious American\r\ncolonists, and a rich reward from their grateful representatives. When\r\nhe wrote on behalf of the 'Rights of Man,' and in furtherance of the\r\n'Age of Reason,' he convinced thousands by his title-pages who were\r\nincapable of perceiving the inconclusiveness of his arguments. His\r\nspeculations have long since gone the way of all shams; and his\r\ncharlatanism as a writer was not redeemed by his character as a man.\r\nNothing could be worse than his private life; he was addicted to the\r\nmost degrading vices. He was no hypocrite, however, and he cannot be\r\ncharged with showing that respect for appearances which constitute the\r\nhomage paid by vice to virtue. Such a man was well qualified for earning\r\nnotoriety by insulting Washington. Only a thorough-paced rascal could\r\nhave had the assurance to charge Washington with being unprincipled and\r\nunpatriotic.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Frothingham's Rise of the Republic of the United States,\r\nChap, xi., p. 472.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet was called \"Common Sense,\" and was written by Thomas Paine,\r\nan Englishman, who held and expressed extreme opinions upon the \"Rights\r\nof Man.\" He had been a staymaker in England, and was ruined; when, in\r\nthe winter of 1774, by Franklin's advice, he came to America and rapidly\r\ngrasped and comprehended the position of affairs. (Elliott's History of\r\nNew England, Vol. II., Chap, xxviii., p. 383.)\r\n\r\nReferring to this demagogue of the American and French Revolution, his\r\nAmerican biographer, Cheetham, says: \"All sects have had their\r\ndisgraceful members and offspring. Paine's father, a peaceful and\r\nindustrious Quaker, connects him with the exemplary sect of the Friends.\r\nHe received his education at the Grammar School of his native place,\r\nThetford, in Norfolk, but attained to little beyond the rudiments of\r\nLatin. His first application to business was in the trade of his father,\r\nthat of staymaker, which he followed in London, Dover, and Sandwich,\r\nwhere he married; afterwards he became a grocer and an exciseman, at\r\nLewes, in Sussex. This situation he lost through some misdemeanor. After\r\nthis, however, so well were the public authorities of his native country\r\ndisposed to serve him, that one of the Commissioners of Excise gave him\r\na letter of recommendation to Dr. Franklin, then a colonial agent in\r\nLondon, who recommended him to go to America. At this period he had\r\nfirst exercised his talents as a writer by drawing up a pamphlet\r\nrecommending the advance of the salaries of excisemen.\r\n\r\n\"His age at this time was thirty-seven. His first engagement in\r\nPhiladelphia was with Mr. Aitkin, a respectable bookseller, who, in\r\nJanuary, 1775, commenced the 'Pennsylvania Magazine,' the editorship of\r\nwhich work became the business of Mr. Paine, who had a salary of £50\r\ncurrency a year. When Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, suggested to Paine the\r\npropriety of preparing the Americans for a separation from England, it\r\nseems that he seized with avidity the idea, and immediately commenced\r\nhis famous pamphlet on that subject, which being shown in MS. to Doctors\r\nFranklin and Rush and Mr. Samuel Adams, was, after some discussion,\r\nentitled, at the suggestion of Dr. Rush, 'Common Sense.' For this\r\nproduction the Legislature of Pennsylvania voted him £500. Shortly\r\nafterwards Paine was appointed Secretary to the Committee of the United\r\nStates on Foreign Affairs. His business was merely to copy papers,\r\nnumber and file them, and generally do the duty of what is now called a\r\nclerk in the Foreign Department. But in the title-page of his 'Rights of\r\nMan,' he styles himself 'Secretary for Foreign Affairs to the Congress\r\nof the United States in the Late War.' While in this office, he\r\npublished a series of appeals on the struggle between Great Britain and\r\nthe colonies. In 1777 he was obliged to resign his secretaryship on\r\naccount of a quarrel with Silas Deane, American agent in France. The\r\nnext year, however, he obtained the appointment of Clerk to the Assembly\r\nof Pennsylvania; and in 1785, on the rejection of a motion to appoint\r\nhim historiographer to the United States, the Congress granted him three\r\nthousand dollars, and the Legislature of New York granted him an estate\r\nof 500 acres of highly cultivated land, the confiscated property of a\r\nLoyalist. Having no more revolutionary occupation in the United States,\r\nhe embarked for France in 1787, with a letter of recommendation from Dr.\r\nFranklin to the Duke de la Rochefoucault. From Paris he went to London,\r\nwhere, the following year, he was arrested for debt, but was bailed by\r\nsome American merchants. He went to Paris in 1791 to publish, under the\r\nname of 'Achilles Du Chatellet,' a tract _recommending the abolition of\r\nroyalty_. He again returned to London and wrote the first part of his\r\n'Rights of Man,' in answer to Mr. Burke's 'Reflections on the French\r\nRevolution.' The second part was published early in 1792. He was ordered\r\nto be arrested and prosecuted for his seditious and blasphemous\r\nwritings, but escaped to France, and was elected a member of the French\r\nNational Convention--grateful for the honour which the bloody anarchists\r\nhad conferred upon him by electing him a member of their order. His\r\nconduct, however, offended the Jacobins, and towards the close of the\r\nyear 1793 he was excluded from the convention, was arrested and\r\ncommitted to the prison of the Luxembourg. Just before his confinement\r\nhe had finished the first part of his 'Age of Reason,' and confided it\r\nto the care of his friend Joel Barlow for publication. He was now taken\r\nill, to which circumstance he ascribed his escape from the guillotine;\r\nand on the fall of Robespierre was released. In 1795 he published, at\r\nParis, the second part of his 'Age of Reason.' He returned to America in\r\n1802, bringing with him a woman named Madame Bonneville, whom he had\r\nseduced away from her husband, with her two sons, and whom he seems to\r\nhave treated with the utmost meanness and tyranny. His friend and\r\nAmerican biographer, Mr. Cheetham, in continuation, gives the following\r\naccount of Paine's arrival at New York in 1802: 'The writer,' says Mr.\r\nCheetham, 'supposing him (Paine) to be a gentleman, was employed to\r\nengage a room for him at Lovett's hotel, New York. On his arrival, in\r\n1802, about ten at night, he wrote me a note, desiring to see me\r\nimmediately. I waited on him at Lovett's, in company with Mr. George\r\nClinton, jun. We rapped at the door. A small figure opened it within,\r\nmeanly dressed, having an old top-coat, without an under one; a dirty\r\nsilk handkerchief loosely thrown around his neck, a long beard of more\r\nthan a week's growth, a face well carbuncled as the setting sun, and the\r\nwhole figure staggering under a load of inebriation. I was on the point\r\nof inquiring for Mr. Paine, when I noticed something of the portraits I\r\nhad seen of him. We were desired to be seated. He had before him a small\r\nround table, on which were a beefsteak, some beer, a pint of brandy, a\r\npitcher of water and a glass. He sat eating, drinking, and talking with\r\nas much composure as if he had lived with us all his life. I soon\r\nperceived that he had a very retentive memory, and was full of anecdote.\r\nThe Bishop of Llandaff (Dr. Watson) was almost the first word he\r\nuttered, and it was followed by his informing us that he had in his\r\ntrunk a manuscript reply to the bishop's 'Apology for the Bible.' He\r\nthen calmly mumbled his steak, and ever and anon drinking his brandy and\r\nbeer, repeated the introduction to his reply, which occupied nearly half\r\nan hour. This was done with deliberation and the utmost clearness, and a\r\nperfect apprehension, intoxicated as he was, of all that he repeated.\r\nScarcely a word would he allow us to speak. He always, I afterwards\r\nfound, in all companies, drunk or sober, would be listened to; in his\r\nregard, there were no _rights of men_ with him--no equality, no\r\nreciprocal immunities and obligations--for he would listen to no one.'\r\n\r\n\"On the 13th of October, 1802, he arrived at Baltimore, under the\r\nprotection of Mr. Jefferson. But it appears that curiosity induced no\r\none of distinction to suffer his approach. While at his hotel he was\r\nprincipally visited by the lower class of emigrants from Scotland,\r\nEngland, and Ireland, who had read and admired his 'Rights of Man.' With\r\nthem, it appears, 'he drank grog in the tap-room morning, noon, and\r\nnight, admired and praised, strutting and staggering about, showing\r\nhimself to all and shaking hands with all. The leaders of the party to\r\nwhich he had attached himself paid him no attention.'\"\r\n\r\nPaine's subsequent years, until his miserable death in 1809, were\r\ncharacterized by the lowest degradation, blasphemy, drunkenness, and\r\nfilthiness, which rendered him unfit for any human society, as his\r\nbiographies, written even by his friends, abundantly testify.\r\n\r\nThose who knew Paine in his earlier years were, of course, not\r\nresponsible for the depravity and degradation of his subsequent years;\r\nbut from the beginning he was an infidel and an enemy of all settled\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSuch was the author of American republicanism and of American hatred to\r\nEngland, to all British institutions, to all monarchy, and the advocate\r\nof the abolition of kings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxii., pp. 161, 162, 163.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nHIRING OF FOREIGNERS AND EMPLOYMENT AND TREATMENT OF INDIANS IN THE\r\nAMERICAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo two acts of the British Government in connection with the American\r\nwar were more deprecated on both sides of the Atlantic than the\r\nemployment of foreign troops and Indians against the colonists; they\r\nwere among the alleged and most exciting causes of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; they weakened British influence throughout the colonies;\r\nthey roused thousands to arms who would have otherwise remained\r\npeacefully at home. In England they were denounced by the highest\r\npersonages both in and out of Parliament, and by the public at\r\nlarge.[70]\r\n\r\nThese Hessian mercenaries, though much lauded at first, and dreaded by\r\nthe colonists, proved to be inferior to the British soldiers, were not\r\nreliable, deserted in large numbers, and plundered everywhere, without\r\nregard to Loyalists or Disloyalists, and strengthened the American\r\nresistance far more than they strengthened the British army.[71]\r\n\r\nBut if the hiring of foreign troops at an enormous expense was\r\ndisgraceful and impolitic, the employment _of Indians_ against the\r\ncolonists was still more impolitic and unnatural an outrage upon\r\ncivilization and humanity; and what is still even more to be lamented is\r\nthat this enlistment of savages in the warfare of one branch of the\r\nBritish family against another was sanctioned if not instigated by the\r\nKing himself.[72]\r\n\r\nDuring the war between France and England, which commenced in 1755, both\r\nparties sought the alliance and support of the Indians, and employed\r\nthem in the savage work of border warfare. The French succeeded in\r\nsecuring the greater number of the Indians, and used them with dreadful\r\neffect, murdering and scalping thousands of the British colonists along\r\nthe inland frontiers of the several colonies. At the termination of the\r\nwar by the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, and the extinction of French power\r\nin America, the French authorities commended the Indians to cultivate\r\nthe friendship of England, whose great superiority and success in the\r\nwar tended to turn the Indian affections and interest in favour of the\r\nBritish. Dr. Ramsay observes: \"The dispute between Great Britain and her\r\ncolonies began to grow serious, and the friendship of the Indians became\r\na matter of consequence to both parties. Stretching for fifteen hundred\r\nmiles along the whole north-western frontier of the colonies, they were\r\nto them desirable friends and formidable enemies. As terror was one of\r\nthe engines by which Great Britain intended to enforce the submission of\r\nthe colonies, nothing could be more conducive to the excitement of this\r\npassion than the co-operation of the Indians. Policy, not cruelty, led\r\nto the adoption of this expedient, but it was of that over refined\r\nspecies which counteracts itself. In the competition for the friendship\r\nof the Indians, the British had advantages far superior to any possessed\r\nby the colonists. The expulsion of the French from Canada--an event\r\nwhich had taken place only thirteen years before--was still fresh in the\r\nmemory of many of the savages, and had inspired them with high ideas of\r\nthe martial superiority of the British troops. The first steps taken by\r\nCongress to oppose Great Britain put it out of their power to gratify\r\nthe Indians. Such was the effect of the non-importation agreement of\r\n1774. While Great Britain had access to the principal Indian tribes\r\nthrough Canada on the north, and Florida on the south, and was\r\nabundantly able to supply their many wants, the colonists had debarred\r\nthemselves from importing the articles which were necessary for the\r\nIndian trade.\"[73]\r\n\r\nThe employment of the Indians in this civil war was in every respect\r\ndisadvantageous to England. It was disapproved and denounced throughout\r\nEngland and Europe, as unnatural and inhuman; it was disapproved by the\r\nEnglish commanders and even Loyalists in America, and inflamed the\r\ncolonists to the highest degree. Wherever the Indians were employed,\r\nthey were a source of weakness to the English army, while their ravages\r\nand cruelties disgusted the Loyalists and brought disgrace upon the\r\nEnglish arms and cause. Sir Guy Carleton forbade their crossing from\r\nCanada into the colonies, and was afterwards accused in England for\r\ndisobedience in not employing them;[74] and General Burgoyne gave the\r\nstrictest orders against their murdering and plundering. His defeat near\r\nSaratoga was largely owing to the conduct of the Indians in his army.\r\n\r\nAmerican historians dilate with much eloquence and justice upon the\r\nemployment of Indians against the colonists, and narrate, with every\r\npossible circumstance of aggravation, every act of depredation and\r\ncruelty on the part of the Indians against the white inhabitants that\r\nespoused the cause of Congress; but they omit to state in like manner\r\nthat Congress itself endeavoured to enlist the Indians in its quarrel\r\nwith the mother country; that General Washington recommended their\r\nemployment against the English,[75] and that the very idea of engaging\r\nthe Indians in this civil war originated with the first promoters of the\r\nrevolution in Massachusetts. Nor do American historians state frankly\r\nand fairly that for every aggression and outrage committed by the\r\nIndians, the American soldiers, even under the express order of\r\nCongress, retaliated with a tenfold vengeance--not in the manner of\r\ncivilized warfare, but after the manner and destruction of the savages\r\nthemselves. The American writers had also great advantages in\r\nrepresenting everything in regard to the proceedings of the\r\nrevolutionists in the brightest light, and everything connected with the\r\nLoyalists and the English in the darkest colours, as they had the\r\nreports, letters, and all other papers relating to these subjects in\r\ntheir own exclusive possession, and published only such and so much of\r\nthem as answered their purpose; even the internal proceedings of\r\nCongress were secret,[76] and only became known after the close of the\r\nwar. And many of the most important historical facts relating to the war\r\nhave been brought to light in the biographies and correspondence of the\r\nmen who figured in the revolution; and many letters and papers of great\r\nhistorical value in throwing light upon the events and conduct of\r\nparties during that period have only been published during the present\r\ncentury, and some of them for the first time during the present\r\ngeneration. This is true in regard to much that relates to the\r\nemployment and proceedings of the Indians, as well as in regard to those\r\nof the Loyalists and various events of the American revolution.\r\nAccording to American historians, the idea of employing the Indians in\r\nthe civil war was the wicked conception of British malignity, and\r\neverywhere reprobated in America; while the idea was actually first\r\nconceived and embodied in a resolution by the Provincial Congress of\r\nMassachusetts. At Cambridge a new Provincial Congress had assembled,\r\nwith the popular feeling in their favour, and with several thousands of\r\nmilitia or minute men under their command. But the most determined of\r\nall their measures was to enlist a company of Stockbridge Indians\r\nresiding in their province. Further still, they directed a secret\r\nletter--and a secret it has been kept for more than fifty years--to a\r\nmissionary much esteemed by the Indians in the western parts of New\r\nYork, entreating \"that you will use your influence with them to join us\r\nin the defence of our rights,\"--in other words, to assail and scalp the\r\nBritish soldiers.[77] It is worthy of remark, that the Massachusetts\r\ndelegates, the framers of this letter, were among those who expressed\r\nthe highest astonishment and indignation when, at a later period, a\r\nsimilar policy was adopted on the British side.[78]\r\n\r\n\"Under date of the 27th of July, 1776, General Washington wrote to\r\nCongress,\" says Mr. Allen, \"expressing respectful anxiety that the\r\nStockbridge Indians shall be employed, and remarks that they were\r\ndissatisfied at not being included in the late order for enlisting their\r\npeople, and had inquired the cause of General Putman.\r\n\r\n\"The reasons he assigns for recommending their employment are such as\r\nhave influenced, and probably determined, the Americans from that time\r\nto the termination of the last war (1812-1815) with Great Britain--that\r\nis, the impossibility of keeping them neutral; the fear of their joining\r\nthe enemy; while the customs of savage warfare are so repulsive to all\r\nthe feelings of humanity and pride of the soldier, that it would seem no\r\npalliation could be received for the crime of having sanctioned them by\r\nexample. Indians are active and serviceable when properly employed. They\r\nare the best defence against Indians. Acquainted from their birth with\r\nwiles and stratagems, they can trace the enemy, and tell its numbers,\r\nits footsteps, when the eye of the white man cannot discover a trace;\r\nand the moving of grass or rushes, which would be unregarded by a\r\nregular soldier, as the natural effect of winds, leads the Indian to be\r\nprepared for an ambush. The certainty that Indians can be restrained\r\nwhen it is wished, reconciles the opposite contradictions which are so\r\noften seen between the complaints made by the Americans that the enemy\r\nemployed savages, at the very moment that they also employed them.\"[79]\r\n\r\nIt is thus clear that both parties courted the co-operation of the\r\nIndians, and employed them to the utmost of their power; and therefore\r\none party has no just ground of reproach against or advantage over the\r\nother party for the inhuman policy of enlisting the Indians in their\r\ncause, though the British had larger means and greater facilities in\r\nsecuring this savage co-operation.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged, and no doubt truly, that the American commanders\r\nrestrained the cruel and plundering propensities of the Indians, and the\r\nEnglish commanders did the same; but neither the English nor the\r\nAmericans were always able to control their Indian allies on or after\r\nthe day of battle. American writers have, however, charged the outrages\r\nof the Indians in the English army, and scouting parties, to the\r\nsanction of the British generals,[80] and the prompting of the British\r\nLoyalists, and some English writers have reiterated the charge. The\r\nemployment of the Indians at all was against the judgment of both\r\nGeneral Burgoyne and Sir Guy Carleton,[81] and only submitted to in\r\nobedience to the King's authority. As early as the 11th of July, 1776,\r\nBurgoyne (while pursuing his enterprise from Montreal to Albany)\r\ncomplains as follows of the conduct of the Indians to the Secretary of\r\nState: \"Confidentially to your Lordship, I may acknowledge that in\r\nseveral instances I have found the Indians little more than a name. If,\r\nunder the management of their conductors, they are indulged for\r\ninterested reasons in all the caprices and humours of spoiled children\r\nlike them, they grow more unreasonable and importunate upon every new\r\nfavour. Were they left to themselves, enormities too horrid to think of\r\nwould ensue; guilty and innocent, women and infants, would be a common\r\nprey.\"[82]\r\n\r\nWhile the Indians were an incumbrance to Burgoyne's army during his\r\nwhole campaign, and forsook him in the eventful hour when he most needed\r\nthem, their barbarities contributed greatly to swell the revolutionary\r\narmy, and to alienate great numbers of Loyalists, weakening Burgoyne's\r\narmy in the very country where he expected most support from the\r\ninhabitants, and giving the American general, Gates, a great\r\npreponderance of strength over him--the army of Burgoyne being reduced\r\nto 3,500 men fit for actual service, while that of Gates was increased\r\nto upwards of 16,000 fit for actual service.[83]\r\n\r\nBut if the British exceeded the Americans in gaining the greater part of\r\nthe Indians to their cause, and the corresponding disgrace and\r\ndisadvantage of their accompanying the army, the Americans far outdid\r\nthe English and the Indians themselves in the work of desolation and\r\ndestruction. Dr. Ramsay remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The undisturbed tranquillity which took place in South Carolina and the\r\nadjacent States after the British had failed in their designs against\r\nthem in the spring and summer of 1776, gave an opportunity of carrying\r\nwar into the Indian country. This was done, not so much to punish what\r\nwas past, as to prevent all future co-operation between the Indians and\r\nBritish in that quarter. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia sent about the same time a considerable force, which traversed\r\nthe Indian settlements, burned their towns, and destroyed their fields\r\nof corn. Above 500 of the Cherokees were obliged, from want of\r\nprovisions, to take refuge in Florida, and were fed at the expense of\r\nthe British Government.\"[84]\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that this was not an invasion of the white\r\nsettlements by the Indians, but an invasion of the Indian settlements by\r\nthe whites; it was a \"carrying war into the Indian country;\" it was not\r\nprovoked by the Indians, but \"was done to prevent all future\r\nco-operation between the Indians and British in that quarter.\" Yet this\r\nwar of _invasion_, this war of _precaution_, was also a war more\r\ndestructive to the Indians than any which they, even under the French,\r\nhad inflicted on the white colonists; for not an Indian cornfield was\r\nleft undestroyed, nor an Indian habitation unconsumed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: The royal historian, Dr. Andrews, says:\r\n\r\n\"The colonies were particularly exasperated at the introduction of\r\nforeign troops into this quarrel. They looked upon this measure as an\r\nunanswerable proof that all regard for their character as Englishmen was\r\nfled, and that Great Britain viewed them as strangers, whom, if she\r\ncould not conquer and enslave, she was determined to destroy. This\r\npersuasion excited their most violent indignation; they considered\r\nthemselves as abandoned to plunder and massacre, and that Britain was\r\nunfeelingly bent on their ruin, by whatsoever means she could compass\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"While the colonists represented this measure in so sanguinary a light,\r\nit was depicted at home in the same colour by their partisans. It was\r\neven reprobated by many individuals who were not averse to the other\r\nparts of the Ministerial plan, but who could not bring themselves to\r\napprove of the interference of foreign mercenaries in our domestic\r\nfeuds.\r\n\r\n\"It was not only throughout the public at large this measure occasioned\r\nso much discontent; after having in Parliament undergone the keenest\r\ncensure of the Opposition, it fell under the displeasure of a\r\nconsiderable number of those who sided with the Minister and were\r\ngenerally used to support the measures of Government; but on this\r\noccasion they loudly dissented from them. Several quitted the House\r\nwithout voting; others, who voted in his favour, obliged him previously\r\nto give them an assurance that he would remove all their doubts and\r\nscruples, and satisfy them clearly on this subject.\" (Dr. Andrews'\r\nHistory of the Late War, Vol. II., Chap. xviii., pp. 76, 77.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: \"The employment of foreign troops to reduce America was an\r\nobject animadverted upon by the Opposition with peculiar violence and\r\nindignation. This, indeed, of all the Ministerial measures, met with the\r\nmost acrimonious notice both in and out of Parliament. * * Foreigners\r\nsaid the Opposition were now taught that Britain, with all its boasted\r\ngreatness, could not find people at home to fight its battles. * * Who\r\ncould behold so disgraceful a measure without feeling for that loss of\r\nnational honour which it must occasion? * * But exclusive of the\r\ndisgrace entailed upon our character, the danger of the system was no\r\nless apparent. What reason had we to trust an army of foreigners, who\r\ncould possibly harbour no motives of enmity to the people against whom\r\nthey were to be employed? The country where these foreigners were to\r\nwage war for us, was precisely that to which we had so often enticed\r\nnumbers to emigrate from their native homes by promises of more _ease_\r\nand happiness than they could enjoy in their own country. * * Of all the\r\nmeasures that had been taken against the Americans, that of hiring\r\nforeigners to invade their country had given the highest offence.\r\nBritish soldiers, though acting in the capacity of foes, still retained\r\nthe feelings of countrymen, and would not shed blood without some\r\ncompunction. They were born and bred in a country noted for humanity,\r\nand the constitution of which inculcated mildness. But the Hessians were\r\nof a ferocious disposition; educated under a despotic Government, they\r\nknew no rights but those of force. They carried destruction wherever\r\nthey were masters, plundering all before them without distinction, and\r\ncommitting the most barbarous ravages.\r\n\r\n\"They had, it was said, been told before their departure from Germany\r\nthat they were to be put in possession of the lands of those whom they\r\nconquered, and they were full of this expectation at their arrival. But\r\nupon discovering their mistake, they resolved, however, to make\r\nthemselves amends by appropriating whatever they could lay their hands\r\nupon. * * The conduct of the Hessians was extremely offensive to the\r\nBritish commanders, but they were too powerful a body to restrain by\r\ncompulsion, as they composed almost one-half of the army.\r\nNotwithstanding the prudence and steadiness with which General Howe\r\nconducted himself upon this emergency, it was not possible to restrain\r\ntheir excesses, nor even prevent them from spreading among the English\r\ntroops in a degree to which they would not have certainly been carried\r\nhad they not such examples for a plea.\r\n\r\n\"The depredations of the Hessians grew at last, it was said, so\r\nenormous, that the spoils they were loaded with became an absolute\r\nincumbrance to them, and a frequent impediment to the discharge of their\r\nmilitary duties.\r\n\r\n\"The desolation of the Jerseys was one of the consequences of this\r\nspirit of rapine. The Americans who adhered to Britain attributed to it\r\nthe subsequent decline of the British cause in these and other parts. As\r\nthe devastation was extended indiscriminately to friend and foe, it\r\nequally exasperated both parties; it confirmed the enmity of the one,\r\nand raised up a new enemy in the other; and it injured the British\r\ninterest in all the colonies.\" (Dr. Andrews' History of the Late War,\r\nVol. II., Chaps. xvii. and xxii., pp. 53, 54-268, 269.)\r\n\r\nDr. Andrews adds, in another place, that--\r\n\r\n\"The resentment occasioned by the depredations that had been carried on\r\nin the Jerseys had left few, if any, friends to Britain in that\r\nprovince. The dread of seeing those plunderers return, who had spared\r\nneither friend nor foe, rendered all parties averse to the cause in\r\nwhich they were employed. To this it was owing that their motions were\r\nobserved with such extreme vigilance, that they stood little or no\r\nchance of succeeding in any of their enterprises. So many had suffered\r\nthrough them, that there was no deficiency of spies to give instant\r\ninformation of whatever they were suspected to have in view; and as much\r\nmischief was done them by such as acted secretly from motives of private\r\nrevenge, as by those who took an open part against them in the field.\"\r\n(Dr. Andrews' History of the American War, etc., Vol. II., Chap, xxiii.,\r\npp. 301, 302.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: \"At the north, the King called to mind that he might 'rely\r\nupon the attachment of his faithful allies, the Six Nations of Indians,'\r\nand he turned to them for immediate assistance. To insure the fulfilment\r\nof his wishes, the order to engage them was sent directly in his name to\r\nthe unscrupulous Indian agent, Guy Johnson, whose functions were made\r\nindependent of Carleton. 'Lose no time,' it was said; 'induce them to\r\ntake up the hatchet against his Majesty's rebellious subjects in\r\nAmerica. It is a service of very great importance; fail not to exert\r\nevery effort that may tend to accomplish it; use the utmost diligence\r\nand activity.'\" (Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. VII.,\r\nChap. xxxiii., p. 349.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxix., pp. 320, 321.\r\n\r\n\"It was unfortunate for the colonies that since the peace of Paris,\r\n1763, the transactions with the Indians had been mostly carried on by\r\nsuperintendents appointed and paid by the King of Great Britain. These\r\nbeing under obligations to the Crown, and expectants of further favours\r\nfrom it, generally used their influence with the Indians in behalf of\r\nthe mother country and against the colonies. * * The Americans were not\r\nunmindful of the savages on their frontier. They appointed commissioners\r\nto explain to them the grounds of their dispute, and to cultivate their\r\nfriendship by treaties and presents. They first sought to persuade the\r\nIndians to join them against Great Britain, but having failed in that,\r\nthey endeavoured to persuade the Indians that the quarrel was by no\r\nmeans relative to them, and that therefore they should take part with\r\nneither side.\r\n\r\n\"For the greater convenience of managing the intercourse between the\r\ncolonies and the Indians, the latter were divided into three\r\ndepartments--the northern, southern, and middle--and commissioners were\r\nappointed for each. Congress also resolved to import and distribute\r\namong them a suitable assortment of goods, to the amount of £40,000\r\nsterling, on account of the United States; but this was not executed.\"\r\n(Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap. xix., p.\r\n321.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: \"Anxious (1775, October) to relieve St. John's, Carleton,\r\nafter the capture of Allen, succeeded in assembling about nine hundred\r\nCanadians at Montreal; but a want of mutual confidence, and the\r\ncertainty that the inhabitants generally favoured the Americans,\r\ndispirited them, and they disappeared by desertions thirty or forty of a\r\nnight, till he was left almost as forlorn as before. The Indians, too,\r\nhe found of little service; 'they were easily dejected, and chose to be\r\nof the strongest side, so that when they were most wanted they\r\nvanished'. But history must preserve the fact that though often urged to\r\nlet them loose on the rebel provinces, in his detestation of cruelty he\r\nwould not suffer a savage to pass the frontier.\" (Bancroft's History of\r\nthe United States, Vol. VIII., Chap. lii., p. 186.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: \"Reading at the present day, we can see how the passionate\r\nand declamatory rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence has left its\r\nstain to this hour on most of the political writing and oratory of\r\nAmerica, and may wish that the birth of a nation had not been screamed\r\ninto the world after this fashion. Nothing could have been easier than,\r\nin the like rhetorical language, to draw up a list of lawlessness and\r\nutter outrage committed by the colonists. Some of the charges will not\r\nbear examination.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, the aid of the Indians had been willingly accepted by the\r\ncolonists in the Canadian expedition since September, 1775; the general\r\nquestion of their employment had been considered by Washington in\r\nconference with a Committee of Congress and delegates of New England\r\nGovernments in October of the same year; and the main objection which\r\nWashington and other officers urged against it, as shown by a letter of\r\nhis to General Schuyler, January 27, 1776, and the answer from the\r\nlatter, was that of expense. He had, nevertheless (April 19, 1776),\r\nadvised Congress 'to engage them on our side,' as 'they must, and no\r\ndoubt soon will, take an active part either for or against us;' and the\r\nCongress itself had, on June 3rd--not a month before the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was actually accepted--passed a resolution to raise 2,000\r\nIndians for the Canadian service, which, shortly afterwards, was\r\nextended by another (referred to in a letter of Washington's of June\r\n20), authorizing General Washington to employ such Indians as he should\r\ntake into the service in any place where he might think that they would\r\nbe most useful, and to offer them bounties, not indeed for scalps, but\r\nfor every officer and soldier of the King's troops whom they might\r\ncapture in the Indian country or on the frontiers of the colonies. When\r\nall this had been done, it needed the forgetfulness and the blind\r\nhypocrisy of passion to denounce the King to the world for having\r\n'endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless\r\nIndian savages;' yet the American people have never had the self-respect\r\nto erase this charge from a document generally printed in the fore-front\r\nof their Constitution and Laws, and with which every schoolboy is\r\nsedulously made familiar.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, indeed, it would have been otherwise had not the charge been\r\none which circumstances appeared to confirm. For, in fact, owing to\r\ncauses already indicated, the Americans never could make friends of the\r\nIndians in the contest, and consequently the 'merciless savages'\r\ncontinue in history to figure on the side of the British. Who could\r\nwonder at it? At the date of the Declaration of Independence, the Indian\r\nchild had only just reached man's estate, who in the year of his birth\r\nmight have escaped being a victim to the bounty of £20, held out for the\r\nscalp of every Indian woman and child, by Massachusetts, in 1775, whilst\r\none of £40 had been offered for that of his father, raised in 1776 to\r\n£300. It did not require the retentive memory of the redskin to make him\r\nlook with suspicion on solicitations of friendship from men who might\r\nhave been parties to such schemes of extermination to his race.\" (The\r\nLudlow's History of the War of Independence, 1777-1783, Chap. v., pp.\r\n124-126.)\r\n\r\n\"But Jefferson's violent pamphlet should, in fact, be looked upon less\r\nas a Declaration of Independence than as a Declaration of War--less as\r\nan assertion of right than as a cry of defiance uttered in the hour of\r\ngrave peril, and in the face of a formidable foe.\"--_Ib._, p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Some of the members of Congress were, at times, not so\r\nreticent as their oaths of secrecy required, and the squabbles of\r\nConference became known abroad. It is a curious illustration of the\r\ndignity and character of a body, when the least publication of its\r\nproceedings becomes its disgrace.\r\n\r\n\"In those days (1779), far unlike our own, the Congress resembled a\r\nCommittee or a Junta, much rather than a chamber of debate. The\r\nspeeches, it is said, were all in the style of private conversation.\r\nThere were never more than forty members present, often no more than\r\ntwenty. These small numbers, however, by no means ensured harmony, nor\r\nprecluded violent and unseemly quarrels, rumours of which were not slow\r\nin passing the Atlantic. 'For God's sake,' thus wrote La Fayette from\r\nFrance, 'for God's sake, prevent the Congress from disputing loudly\r\ntogether. Nothing so much hurts the interest and reputation of America.'\r\nThus the object of concealment, unless, perhaps, for private purposes,\r\nwas most imperfectly attained, although, in name at least, the\r\ndeliberations of Congress at this time were secret. Historically, even\r\nthe Journal which they kept gives little light as to their true\r\nproceedings. An American gentleman, who has studied that document with\r\ncare, laments that it is 'painfully meagre, the object being apparently\r\nto record as little as possible.'\" (Lord Mahon's History of England,\r\nVol. VII., Chap. lviii., pp. 420, 421; quoting as his authority, \"Letter\r\nof La Fayette to Washington, June 12, 1779,\" and \"Life of President\r\nReed,\" by Mr. Wm.

By such means,\r\nand still more, perhaps, by the natural spirit of a free-born people\r\nwhen threatened with invasion, a resolute energy against Burgoyne was\r\nroused in the New England States.\"--_Ib._, p. 261.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: \"Carleton from the first abhorred the measure of employing\r\nthe Indians, which he was yet constrained to promote.\" (Bancroft, Vol.\r\nVII., p. 119.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Quoted in Lord Mahon's History, Vol. VII., Chap. lvi., p.\r\n259. After quoting this letter, Lord Mahon adds:\r\n\r\n\"It is due to Burgoyne to state, that from the first he had made most\r\nstrenuous exertions, both by word and deed, to prevent any such\r\nenormities. The testimony, for example, of his aide-de-camp, Lord\r\nPetersham, when examined before the House of Commons, is clear and\r\nprecise upon that point. (See Burgoyne's Narrative and Collection of\r\nDocuments, pp. 65, 66, second edition.) But in spite of all restraints,\r\nthe cruel temper and lawless habits of these savages would sometimes\r\nburst forth--sometimes not more fatally to their enemies than to their\r\nfriends. The tragical fate of Miss MacRea raised one loud cry of\r\nindignation on both sides of the Atlantic. This lady, in the bloom of\r\nyouth and beauty, the daughter of an American Loyalist, was betrothed to\r\nan officer in the British provincial troops. Anxious for her security,\r\nthe officer engaged some Indians to escort her from her home and convey\r\nher to the British camp, where the marriage would be solemnized. As a\r\nfurther precaution, he promised to reward the person who should bring\r\nher safe to him with a barrel of rum. But this very precaution, as it\r\nseemed to be, was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Two of the\r\nIndians who took charge of her began a quarrel on the way, as to which\r\nof them should first present her to the bridegroom. Each was eager for\r\nthe rum; each resolute that his companion should not receive it in his\r\nplace. At last one of them in sudden fury raised his tomahawk, struck\r\nMiss MacRea upon the head, and laid her a corpse at his feet. General\r\nBurgoyne at this news displayed his utmost resentment and concern. He\r\ncompelled the Indians to deliver up the murderer, and designed to put\r\nhim to death. He was only induced to spare his life upon the Indians\r\nagreeing to terms which the General thought would be more effectual than\r\nany execution, in deterring them from similar barbarities. Deterred,\r\nindeed, they were. But when they found themselves precluded from their\r\nexpected delights of plundering and scalping, they began to desert and\r\ngo home. Of nearly five hundred who at the outset had joined Burgoyne,\r\nless than threescore at last remained beneath his banner.\"--_Ib._, pp.\r\n259-261.\r\n\r\nAt the first general encampment of Burgoyne's army on the western side\r\nof Lake Champlain, he met a deputation of the Indians in alliance with\r\nGreat Britain, and made an animated speech to them. \"He exhorted them to\r\nbehave with courage and fidelity to their friends, and to avoid all\r\nbarbarity towards their enemies. He entreated them to be particularly\r\ncareful in distinguishing between the adherents and foes to the British\r\nnation. He earnestly requested that they would put none to death but\r\nsuch as actually opposed them with arms in their hands, and to spare old\r\nmen, women, children, and prisoners; to scalp only such as they had\r\nkilled in action, and to treat compassionately the wounded and dying. He\r\npromised them a reward for every prisoner they brought in, but assured\r\nthem he would look narrowly into every demand for scalps.\" (Dr. Andrews'\r\nHistory of the Late War, Vol. II., Chap, xxviii., p. 383.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: \"The apprehensions of those who had been averse to the\r\nemployment of the Indians in the British army began to be justified.\r\nNotwithstanding the care and precautions taken by General Burgoyne to\r\nprevent the effects of their barbarous disposition, they were sometimes\r\ncarried to an excess that shocked his humanity--the more, as it was\r\ntotally out of his power to control them in the degree that he had hoped\r\nand proposed. The outrages they committed were such as proved highly\r\ndetrimental to the royal cause. They spared neither friend nor foe, and\r\nexercised their usual cruelties with very little attention to the\r\nthreats that were held out in order to restrain and deter them.\r\n\r\n\"Several instances of this nature happened about this time, which\r\ncontributed powerfully to alienate the minds of many from the cause in\r\nwhich they served. One was recorded, in particular, that equally struck\r\nboth parties with horror. A young lady, the daughter of Mr. MacRea, a\r\nzealous royalist, being on her way to the British army, where she was to\r\nbe married to an officer, unhappily fell into the hands of the Indians,\r\nwho, without regarding her youth and beauty, murdered her with many\r\ncircumstances of barbarity.\r\n\r\n\"Scenes of this nature served to render the royal party extremely\r\nodious. However the Americans might be conscious that the Indians were\r\nas offensive, and as much abhorred by their enemies as by themselves,\r\nstill they could not forgive them the acceptance of such auxiliaries as\r\nmust necessarily disgrace the best cause.\r\n\r\n\"The resentment occasioned by the conduct of the Indians, and no less\r\nthe dread of being exposed to their fury, helped considerably to bring\r\nrecruits from every quarter to the American army. It was considered as\r\nthe only place of refuge and security at present. The inhabitants of the\r\ntracts contiguous to the British army took up arms against it almost\r\nuniversally. The preservation of their families was now become an object\r\nof immediate concern. As the country was populous, they flocked in\r\nmultitudes to the American general's camp; and he soon found himself at\r\nthe head of an army which, though composed of militia and undisciplined\r\nmen, was animated with that spirit of indignation and revenge which so\r\noften supplies all military deficiencies.\" (Dr. Andrews' History of the\r\nLate War, Vol. II., Chap. xxviii., pp. 393, 394.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxix., p. 322.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACRE OF WYOMING--FOUR VERSIONS OF IT BY ACCREDITED AMERICAN\r\nHISTORIANS, ALL DIFFERING FROM EACH OTHER--THE FACTS INVESTIGATED, AND\r\nFALSE STATEMENTS CORRECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be useless and tedious to attempt even a condensed account of\r\nthe battles and warfare in which the Indians took part between the\r\nEnglish and the Congress; but there is one of these revengeful and\r\nmurderous occurrences which must be minutely stated, and the American\r\naccounts of it thoroughly investigated, as it has been the subject of\r\nmore misrepresentation, more declamation, more descriptive and poetic\r\nexaggeration, and more denunciation against the English by American\r\nhistorians and orators than any other transaction of the American\r\nrevolution--namely, what is known as the \"Massacre of Wyoming.\" There\r\nare four versions of it, by accredited American histories.\r\n\r\nThe account of this massacre is thus given in the words of Dr. Ramsay's\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\n\"A storm of Indian and Tory vengeance burst in July, 1778, with\r\nparticular violence on Wyoming, a new and flourishing settlement on the\r\neastern branch of the Susquehanna. Unfortunately for the security of the\r\ninhabitants, the soil was claimed both by Connecticut and Pennsylvania.\r\nFrom the collision of contradictory claims, founded on Royal Charters,\r\nthe laws of neither were steadily enforced. In this remote settlement,\r\nwhere government was feeble, the Tories were under less control, and\r\ncould easily assemble undiscovered. Nevertheless, twenty-seven of them\r\nwere taken and sent to Hartford, in Connecticut, but they were\r\nafterwards released. These and others of the same description,\r\ninstigated by revenge against the Americans, from whom some of them had\r\nsuffered banishment and loss of property, made common cause with the\r\nIndians, and attacked the Wyoming settlement with their combined forces,\r\nestimated at 1,100 men, 900 of whom were Indians. The whole was\r\ncommanded by Colonel John Butler, a Connecticut Tory. One of the forts\r\nwhich had been constructed for the security of the inhabitants, being\r\nvery weak, surrendered to this party; but some of the garrison had\r\nretired to the principal fort at Kingston, called Forty Fort. Colonel\r\nJohn Butler next demanded the surrender thereof. Colonel Zebulon Butler,\r\na continental officer, who commanded, sent a message to him, proposing a\r\nconference at a bridge without the fort. This being agreed to, Colonel\r\nZebulon Butler, Dennison, and some other officers repaired to the place\r\nappointed, and they were followed by the whole garrison, a few invalids\r\nexcepted. None of the enemy appeared. The Wyoming people advanced, and\r\nsupposed that the enemy were retiring. They continued to march on till\r\nthey were about three miles from the fort. They then saw a few of the\r\nenemy, with whom they exchanged a few shots; but they presently found\r\nthemselves ambuscaded and attacked by the whole bodies of Indians and\r\nTories. They fought gallantly, till their retreat to the fort was cut\r\noff. Universal confusion ensued. Out of 417 who had marched out of the\r\nfort, about 360 were instantly slain. No quarter was given. Colonel John\r\nButler again demanded the surrender of Forty Fort. This was agreed to,\r\nunder articles of capitulation, by which the effects of the people\r\ntherein were secured to them. The garrison, consisting of thirty men and\r\ntwo hundred women, were permitted to cross the Susquehanna, and retreat\r\nthrough the woods to Northampton county. The most of the other scattered\r\nsettlers had previously retired, some through the woods to Northampton,\r\nothers down the river to Northumberland. In this retreat, some women\r\nwere delivered of children in the woods, and many suffered from want of\r\nprovisions. Several of the settlers at Wyoming had erected good houses\r\nand barns, and made considerable improvements. These and the other\r\nhouses in the vicinity were destroyed. Their horses, cattle, sheep, and\r\nhogs were, for the most part, killed or driven away by the enemy. A\r\nlarge proportion of the male inhabitants were in one day slaughtered.\r\nIn a single engagement, near two hundred women became widows, and a much\r\ngreater number of children were left fatherless.\" (Dr. Ramsay's History\r\nof the United States, Vol. II., Chap. xix., pp. 323, 324.)\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS UPON DR. RAMSAY'S ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of this melancholy affair by Dr. Ramsay, a friend of\r\nGeneral Washington, and a distinguished officer in the American army.\r\nLet us note Dr. Ramsay's admissions and his omissions. He admits that\r\nthe Tories or Loyalists had been persecuted, imprisoned, plundered, and\r\nbanished; that no less than twenty-seven of them had been taken, and\r\nsent to Hartford, in Connecticut, but were afterwards released; yet he\r\nmight have added that they were kept prisoners nearly a year, and then\r\ndischarged for want of any evidence against them. It is also admitted\r\nthat \"others of the same description (as those who had been sent\r\nprisoners to Connecticut) were instigated by _revenge_ against the\r\nAmericans, from whom some of them had suffered banishment and loss of\r\nproperty.\" It is likewise admitted that the whole invading party\r\nconsisted of but 1,100 men, of whom only 200 were Tories, the remaining\r\n900 being Indians. But it is not stated that those Indians were\r\nneighbours, and many of them the connections of the northern tribes of\r\nthose Indians whose settlements had been invaded, their fields and towns\r\ndestroyed, as a precaution lest they should co-operate with the British;\r\nnor is it said that many of these Indians were residents in the\r\nneighbourhood, and were treated like the Tories.\r\n\r\nIt furthermore appears from this narrative that the Americans in Wyoming\r\nwere not even taken by surprise, but were prepared for their enemy; that\r\nnone were killed except in the conflict of the battle; that the thirty\r\nmen and two hundred women in the garrison were not murdered, but were\r\n\"permitted (with their effects) to cross the Susquehanna and retreat to\r\nNorthampton.\" The taking of the cattle and burning of the houses and\r\nbarns was after the example of the Americans in invading and destroying\r\nthe Indian settlements. It is therefore clear, according to Dr. Ramsay's\r\nown narrative, that the \"Massacre of Wyoming\" was not an _unprovoked\r\naggression_, like that of the Americans against the more Southern\r\nIndians, but a _retaliation_ for injuries previously inflicted by the\r\naggressors.[85]\r\n\r\nBut as the \"Massacre of Wyoming\" is the case selected by American\r\nhistorians and poets to exhaust their indignation against English\r\ncruelty in employing the Indians in the civil war, we will not dismiss\r\nit with the above cursory remarks, but will examine it with some degree\r\nof minuteness.\r\n\r\nWyoming was a pleasant and fertile valley, situated on the eastern\r\nbranch of the Susquehanna, and consisted of eight townships, five square\r\nmiles each. It had been claimed as part of Pennsylvania; but\r\nConnecticut, relying upon the authority of a more ancient Charter, had\r\nsince the last war made a large settlement on the banks of that\r\nbeautiful river. \"The exquisitely beautiful valley of Wyoming, where, on\r\nthe banks of the Susquehanna, the wide and rich meadows, shut in by\r\nwalls of wooded mountains, attracted emigrants from Connecticut, through\r\ntheir claim of right under the Charter of their native colony, was in\r\nconflict with the territorial jurisdiction of the proprietaries of\r\nPennsylvania.\"[86]\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene of a tragedy which thrilled all America and Europe;\r\nfor the accounts published in Europe were the repetitions of the\r\nexaggerated American statements, omitting for the most part the causes\r\nof the tragedy and the retaliation which followed it.\r\n\r\nI will now present and collate the three other accounts, with that of\r\nDr. Ramsay, of those tragical events on both sides.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft states as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Seneca tribe, fresh from the memory of their chiefs and braves who\r\nfell in conflict with the New York husbandmen at Oriskany. Their king,\r\nSucingerachton, was, both in war and in council, the foremost man of\r\nall the Six Nations. Compared with him, the Mohawk Brant, who had been\r\nbut lately known upon the warpath, was lightly esteemed.[87] His\r\nattachment to the English increased to a passion on the alliance of the\r\nAmericans with the French, for whom he cherished implacable hate.\r\nThrough his interest, and by the blandishments of gifts and pay and\r\nchances of revenge, Colonel John Butler lured the _Seneca_ warriors to\r\ncross the border of Pennsylvania under the British flag.\r\n\r\n\"The party of savages and rangers, numbering between five hundred and\r\nseven hundred men, fell down the Tioga river, and on the last day of\r\nJune hid in the forests above Wyoming. The next day the two northernmost\r\nforts capitulated. The men of Wyoming, old and young, with one regular\r\ncompany, in all hardly more than three hundred, took counsel with one\r\nanother, and found no hope of deliverance for their families but through\r\na victorious encounter with a foe twice their number, and more skilful\r\nin the woods than themselves. On the 3rd day of July, the devoted band,\r\nled by Colonel Zebulon Butler, who had just returned from the\r\ncontinental service, began their march up the river.[88] The horde of\r\ninvaders, pretending to retreat, crouched themselves on the ground in\r\nthe open wood. The villagers of Wyoming began firing as they drew near,\r\nand at the third volley stood within a hundred yards of the ambush, when\r\nthe Seneca braves began the attack, and were immediately seconded by the\r\nrangers. The Senecas gave no quarter, and in less than half an hour took\r\ntwo hundred and twenty-five scalps, among them those of two field\r\nofficers and seven captains. The rangers saved but five of their\r\ncaptives. On the British side only two whites were killed and eight\r\nIndians wounded. The next day the remaining forts, filled chiefly with\r\nwomen and children, capitulated. The long and wailing procession of\r\nsurvivors flying from their fields of corn, their gardens, the flames of\r\ntheir cottages, the unburied bodies of their beloved defenders, escaped\r\nby a pass through the hills to the eastern settlements. Every fort and\r\ndwelling was burned down.\r\n\r\n\"The Senecas spread over the surrounding country, adepts in murder and\r\nruin. The British leader boasted in his report that his party had burned\r\na thousand houses and every mill (a great exaggeration). Yet, marauders\r\ncame to destroy and deal deaths, not to recover or hold; and the ancient\r\naffection for England was washed out in blood (more truly, the revenge\r\nfor wrongs previously received). When the leader of the inroad turned to\r\ndesolate other scenes, Pennsylvania was left in undisputed possession of\r\nher soil.\" (Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. X., Chap. v.,\r\npp. 137, 138.)\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker briefly states the affair in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The settlement of Wyoming, in Pennsylvania, was assailed in July by a\r\nlarge body of savages, who, having obtained easy possession of it,\r\nindiscriminately butchered both the garrison and the inhabitants; and\r\nsoon afterwards Wilkesbarre shared the same fate. Near three thousand\r\nhad succeeded in effecting their escape.[89]\r\n\r\n\"To prevent their return to the scenes of their former happiness,\r\neverything that could contribute to their comfort--houses, crops,\r\nanimals--were, with an industry equal to their malignity, destroyed by\r\nthe savages.\" (Tucker's History of the United States, Vol. I., Chap.\r\niii., p. 239.)\r\n\r\nThe following account of the \"Wyoming Massacre\" appears more\r\nintelligible and consistent than any of the preceding. Says Mr.\r\nHildreth:\r\n\r\n\"There had come in among the Connecticut settlers at Wyoming a number of\r\nDutch and Scotch from New York, some thirty of whom, shortly after the\r\ncommencement of the war, had been seized under the suspicion of being\r\nTories, and sent to Connecticut for trial. They were discharged for want\r\nof evidence; but if not Tories before, they soon became so. Returning\r\nto the valley of the Mohawk, whence they had emigrated to Wyoming, they\r\nenlisted into the partisan corps of Johnson and Butler, and waited\r\neagerly for chances of revenge.\r\n\r\n\"Though Wyoming did not number three thousand inhabitants, it had\r\nfurnished two full companies (one writer says, a thousand men) to the\r\ncontinental army, and had thus in a manner deprived itself of the means\r\nof defence. Congress, upon rumours of intended Indian hostilities, had\r\nordered a third company to be raised as a local garrison; but this corps\r\nwas as yet hardly organized, and very imperfectly armed. Such was the\r\nstate of the settlement when there appeared at the head of the valley an\r\noverwhelming force of Tories and Indians, principally of the Seneca\r\ntribe of the Six Nations, led by Colonel Butler. Some of the inhabitants\r\nwere waylaid and slain. The upper fort, held by disaffected persons,\r\nsurrendered at once. The continentals, with such others as could be\r\nmustered, marched out to meet the enemy: but they were surrounded,\r\ndefeated, and driven back with heavy loss, and several who were taken\r\nprisoners were put to death by the Indians with horrible tortures. Those\r\nwho escaped fled to Fort Wyoming, which was speedily invested. The\r\nsurviving continentals, to avoid being taken prisoners, embarked and\r\nescaped down the river; after which the fort surrendered, upon promise\r\nof security of life and property. Desirous to fulfil these terms, Butler\r\npresently marched away with his Tories, but he could not induce the\r\nIndians to follow. They remained behind, burned the houses, ravaged the\r\nfields, killed such as resisted, and drove the miserable women and\r\nchildren through the woods and mountains to seek refuge where they\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\"These barbarities, greatly exaggerated by reports embodied since in\r\npoetry and history, excited everywhere a lively indignation. Wyoming was\r\npresently re-occupied by a body of continental troops. A continental\r\nregiment of the Pennsylvania line, stationed at Schoharie, penetrated to\r\nthe neighbouring branches of the Upper Susquehanna, and _destroyed the\r\nsettlement_ of Unadilla, occupied by a mixed population of Indians and\r\nrefugees. The Indians and Loyalists soon took their _revenge_ by\r\nsurprising Cherry Valley. The fort, which had a continental garrison,\r\nheld out; Colonel Alden, who lodged in the town, was killed, the\r\nlieutenant-colonel was made prisoner, and the settlement suffered\r\nalmost the fate of Wyoming.\" (Hildreth's History of the United States,\r\nVol. III., Chap, xxxviii., pp. 262, 263.)\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THESE FOUR ACCOUNTS OF THE MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nThe attentive reader has doubtless observed that the four versions given\r\nabove, by four accredited American historians, in regard to the\r\n\"Massacre of Wyoming,\" differ from each other in several essential\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n1. Two of these versions imply that the \"massacre\" was a mere marauding,\r\ncruel, and murderous invasion of an inoffensive and peaceful settlement;\r\nwhile the other two versions of Dr. Ramsay and Mr. Hildreth clearly show\r\nthe provocation and cruel wrongs which the Loyalists, and even Indians,\r\nhad experienced from the continentals and inhabitants of Wyoming; that\r\nthe settlement of Wyoming was the hot-bed of revolutionism, in which,\r\nout of three thousand inhabitants, several hundred had volunteered into\r\nthe continental army, while they, as may be easily conceived, insulted,\r\nimprisoned, banished and confiscated the property of those who regarded\r\ntheir oath of allegiance as inviolate as their marriage vow, \"for better\r\nfor worse,\" until death released them from it. Instead of treating a\r\nsolemn oath as secondary to caprice and passion, the Loyalists carried\r\nit to an excess of integrity and conscience; they were to be the more\r\nrespected and honoured, rather than made on that account criminals and\r\noutlaws, subject to imprisonment and banishment of their persons and the\r\nconfiscation of their property.\r\n\r\n2. Two of these four versions import that the inhabitants, men, women,\r\nand children, were \"indiscriminately butchered;\" the other two versions\r\nimport that none were \"butchered\" except in battle, and none were\r\n\"scalped\" except those who had fallen in battle.\r\n\r\n3. In two of these versions it is stated that those who were in the\r\nforts after their surrender were \"massacred,\" without respect to age or\r\nsex; in the other two versions it is stated that not one of them was\r\nmassacred, but they were all permitted to cross the Susquehanna with\r\ntheir effects.\r\n\r\n4. In one of these versions, Colonel John Butler is represented as not\r\nonly the commander of the whole party of invasion, but the author of all\r\nthe cruelties perpetrated in the \"massacre\" of Wyoming; yet Mr.\r\nHildreth's statement shows the reverse--that Colonel Butler had accepted\r\nthe surrender of Fort Wyoming \"upon the promise of security to life and\r\nproperty;\" that \"desirous to fulfil these terms, he presently marched\r\naway with his Tories; but he could not induce the Indians to follow;\"\r\nthat \"the depredations which followed were inflicted by the Indians\r\nalone, and whom Colonel Butler could not command, and against his\r\nremonstrance and example and that of his Tories.\"\r\n\r\nIt is therefore plain that the accounts at the time of the \"Massacre of\r\nWyoming,\" published by the Congress party, were of the most exaggerated\r\nand inflammatory character, containing the grossest misrepresentation,\r\nand doing the greatest injustice to the leaders and conduct of the\r\nexpedition, of which accounts they had no knowledge, nor any means of\r\ncorrecting them. These partial and shamefully exaggerated accounts and\r\nmisrepresentations were spread through Europe, and produced the most\r\nunfavourable impression in regard to the \"Tories\" and their mixture with\r\nthe Indians--the only place of refuge for them, as they were driven from\r\ntheir homes to escape the sentences of death, imprisonment, or\r\nbanishment, subject in all cases, of course, to the destruction and\r\nconfiscation of their property. The English Annual Register for 1779,\r\nafter reproducing these unjust and inflated accounts, candidly says:\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary to observe, with respect to the destruction of Wyoming,\r\nthat as no narrative of the exploits of the leaders in that transaction,\r\nwhether by authority or otherwise, has yet appeared in this country, we\r\ncan only rely for the authenticity of the facts which we have stated\r\nupon the accounts published by the Americans.\r\n\r\n\"Happy should we deem it, for the honour of humanity that, the whole\r\naccount was demonstrated to be a fable.\" (Vol. IV., p. 14.)\r\n\r\nThe testimony furnished by the four versions of the transaction by\r\nAmerican historians shows how largely the original accounts of it were\r\nfabulous.\r\n\r\nSince compiling and analysing the foregoing four historical versions of\r\nthe \"Massacre of Wyoming,\" I have read Colonel Stone's _Life of Joseph\r\nBrant, Thayendanegea, including the Border Wars of the American\r\nRevolution_, and have carefully examined his account of the \"Massacre of\r\nWyoming.\" Colonel Stone visited the place (1838), and obtained all the\r\ninformation which the oldest inhabitants and family letters could give,\r\nand examined all the papers in the State Paper Office, and obtained much\r\ninformation from correspondence and personal interviews with aged and\r\ndistinguished inhabitants, well acquainted with all the particulars of\r\nthe alleged \"Massacre.\" The result of his researches was to justify the\r\nhopes of the British Annual Register, quoted on previous page, which,\r\nafter having republished the American accounts of the \"Massacre,\" says:\r\n\"Happy should we deem it, for the honour of humanity, that the whole\r\naccount were demonstrated to be a fable.\"\r\n\r\nThis has been done by Colonel Stone after the lapse of more than half a\r\ncentury. In the fifteenth chapter of the first volume of his eloquent\r\nand exhaustive work he gives a history of the settlement, and of the\r\nmany years' wars between the rival claimants of Connecticut and\r\nPennsylvania--the former styled \"the Susquehanna Company,\" and the\r\nlatter \"the Delaware Company.\" The question was also complicated by\r\nIndian claims, as the land had been once acquired by the Six Nations,\r\nand alleged to have been sold to both companies. Many of the Mohawks and\r\nother Indians resided in and near the settlement. On the breaking out of\r\nthe war, politics largely entered into the disputes, and armed conflicts\r\nensued, and no less than ten forts were erected in the settlement.\r\n\r\nAccording to Colonel Stone, the \"Massacre\" was not the result of\r\nsurprise, nor did it involve the indiscriminate massacre of women and\r\nchildren, but was the result of a pitched battle between the Loyalists\r\nand Continentals, in which the latter were the assailants and were\r\ndefeated, and whatever \"massacre\" there was followed the battle.[90]\r\n\r\nColonel Stone, after having given an account of the battle, as stated\r\nin previous note, and having corrected several erroneous statements,\r\nmakes the following correction of what had been often written and\r\ngenerally believed respecting the famous Chief Brant:\r\n\r\n\"There is another important correction to be made in reference to every\r\nwritten history of this battle extant, not even excepting the revised\r\nedition of the Life of Washington, by Chief Justice Marshall. This\r\ncorrection regards the name and just fame of Joseph Brant, whose\r\ncharacter has been blackened with all the infamy, both real and\r\nimaginary, connected with this bloody expedition. Whether Captain Brant\r\nwas at any time in company with this expedition, is doubtful; but it is\r\ncertain, in the face of every historical authority, British and\r\nAmerican, that so far from being engaged in the battle, he was many\r\nmiles distant at the time of its occurrence. Such has been the uniform\r\ntestimony of the British officers engaged in the expedition, and such\r\nwas always the word of Thayendanegea (Brant's Indian name) himself. It\r\nwill, moreover, be seen toward the close of the present work that after\r\nthe publication of Campbell's 'Gertrude of Wyoming,' in which poem the\r\nMohawk chieftain is denounced as 'the Monster Brant,' his son repaired\r\nto England, and in correspondence with the poet, successfully vindicated\r\nhis father's memory from the calumny.\"--_Ib._, p. 338.\r\n\r\nTo all this Colonel Stone adds the following important note. He says:\r\n\"Since the present chapter was written, and while the work was under\r\nrevision, the author received a letter from Mr. Samuel C. Frey, of Upper\r\nCanada, a son of the late Philip Frey, Esquire, a Loyalist of Tryon\r\nCounty, who was ensign in H.B.M.'s Eighth Regiment, and who, with his\r\nregiment, was engaged in the campaign and battle of Wyoming. Philip R.\r\nFrey, the ensign spoken of, died at Palatine, Montgomery (formerly\r\nTryon) County, in 1823. It was his uniform testimony that Brant was not\r\nat Wyoming. Mr. Frey writes to the author that there were no chiefs of\r\nany notoriety with the Indians in that expedition, and that the Indians\r\nthemselves were led from Detroit by Captain Bird, of the Eighth\r\nRegiment. Bird had been engaged in a love affair at Detroit, but being\r\nvery ugly, besides having a hare-lip, was unsuccessful. The affair\r\ngetting wind, his fellow-officers made themselves merry at his expense;\r\nand in order to steep his grief in forgetfulness, he obtained permission\r\nto lead an expedition somewhere against the American frontier. Joining\r\nthe Indians placed under him and a detachment of his regiment to\r\nButler's Rangers, they concerted the descent upon Wyoming. Ensign Frey\r\nstated that Bird was ill-natured during the whole march, and acted with\r\nfoolhardiness at the battle. He further stated, according to the letter\r\nof his son, that the American colonel challenged them to a fair\r\nfield-fight, which challenge was accepted. 'The next morning, about nine\r\no'clock, the Americans poured out of the fort, about 340 in number; the\r\nIndians fell back over a hill; the troops on both sides drew up in\r\nbattle array and soon commenced. After a few rounds fired, the American\r\ncolonel ordered his drum-major to beat a charge; the drum-major mistook\r\nthe order, and beat a retreat; the Americans became disordered\r\nimmediately, and ran helter-skelter; the moment the Indians saw them\r\nrunning, they poured down upon them from their hiding-places, so that no\r\nmore than about forty survived out of 340.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Rarely, indeed,\" adds Colonel Stone, \"does it happen that history is\r\nmore at fault in regard to facts than in the case of Wyoming. The remark\r\nmay be applied to nearly every writer who has attempted to narrate the\r\nevents connected with the invasion of Colonel John Butler. Ramsay and\r\nGordon and Marshall--nay, the British historians themselves have written\r\ngross exaggerations. Marshall, however, in his revised edition, has made\r\ncorrections, and explained how and by whom he was led into error. My\r\nexcellent friend, Charles Miner, Esq., long a resident of Wyoming, a\r\ngentleman of letters and great accuracy, furnished the biographer of\r\nWashington with a true narrative of the transactions which he made the\r\nbasis of the summary account contained in his revised edition. Other\r\nwriters, of greater or less note, have gravely recorded the same\r\nfictions, adding, it is to be feared, enormities not even conveyed to\r\nthem by tradition. The grossest of these exaggerations are contained in\r\nThatcher's Military Journal and in Drake's Book of the Indians. The\r\naccount of the marching out of a large body of the Americans from one of\r\nthe forts to hold a parley, by agreement, and then being drawn into an\r\nambuscade and all put to death, is false; the account of seventy\r\ncontinental soldiers being butchered after having surrendered, is\r\ntotally untrue. No regular troops surrendered, and all escaped who\r\nsurvived the battle of the 3rd. Equally untrue is the story of the\r\nburning of the houses, barracks, and forts, filled with women and\r\nchildren.\"--_Ib._, p. 338, 339.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: \"The aggressors on this occasion were a troop of wild\r\nIndians, in conjunction with some Tory exiles. They were headed by\r\nColonel Butler, a partisan commander of note, and by Joseph Brant, a\r\nhalf Indian by birth, a whole Indian in cruelty. Unhappily, at Wyoming,\r\nthe soil was claimed both by Connecticut and Pennsylvania. From this\r\nconflict of pretensions and consequent laxity of law, there had been the\r\nfreer license for rigours against the Loyalists. Few of them in that\r\ndistrict but had undergone imprisonment, or exile, or confiscation of\r\nproperty; and thus they were provoked to form a savage alliance and to\r\nperpetrate a fierce revenge.\" (Lord Mahon's History, etc., Vol. VII.,\r\nChap. lviii., pp. 382, 383.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. V., Chap.\r\nix., p. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Brant was not at Wyoming. This appears from Butler's\r\nreport; and compare Broadhead documents, Vol. VIII., p. 572 (note by Mr.\r\nBancroft).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: This is what Dr. Ramsay, in his account quoted above, on\r\npages 85 and 86, erroneously states was a proposed conference as to\r\nterms of capitulation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Note._--Mr. Hildreth says that \"Wyoming did not number\r\nthree thousand inhabitants.\" (History of the United States, Vol. III.,\r\nChap. xxxviii., p. 262.) The number of the slain could not have been\r\ngreater than those mentioned above by Dr. Ramsay (p. 86), who states\r\nthat, instead of those in the garrison being \"indiscriminately\r\nbutchered,\" they were allowed to cross the Susquehanna and make their\r\nway through the woods to neighbouring settlements.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Colonel Stone states that the Provincials \"intended to\r\nmake a quick movement, and take the enemy by surprise;\" but their\r\npurpose was discovered by an Indian scout. He then gives the following\r\naccount of the battle and of the \"massacre\" which followed:\r\n\r\n\"The Provincials pushed rapidly forward; but the British and Indians\r\nwere prepared to receive them, 'their line being formed a small distance\r\nin front of their camp, in a plain thinly covered with pine, shrub, oaks\r\nand undergrowth, and extending from the river to a marsh at the foot of\r\nthe mountain' (Marshall). 'On coming in view of the enemy, the\r\nAmericans, who had previously marched in a single column, instantly\r\ndeployed into a line of equal extent, and attacked from right to left at\r\nthe same time' (Col. Z. Butler's letter). 'The right of the Americans\r\nwas commanded by Colonel Zebulon Butler, opposed to Colonel John Butler,\r\ncommanding the enemy's left. Colonel Dennison commanded the left of the\r\nAmericans, and was opposed by the Indians forming the enemy's right'\r\n(Chapman). The battle commenced at about forty rods distance, without\r\nmuch execution at the onset, as the brushwood interposed obstacles to\r\nthe sight. The militia stood the fire well for a short time, and as they\r\npressed forward there was some giving way on the enemy's right.\r\nUnluckily, just at this moment the appalling war-whoop of the Indians\r\nrang in the rear of the Americans' left; the Indian leader, having\r\nconducted a large party of his warriors through the marsh, succeeded in\r\nturning Dennison's flank. A heavy and destructive fire was\r\nsimultaneously poured into the American ranks; and amidst the confusion,\r\nColonel Dennison directed his men to 'fall back,' to avoid being\r\nsurrounded, and to gain time to bring his men into order again. This\r\ndirection was mistaken for an order to 'retreat,' whereupon the whole\r\nline broke, and every effort of their officers to restore order was\r\nunavailing. At this stage of the battle, and while thus engaged, the\r\nAmerican officers mostly fell. The flight was general. The Indians,\r\nthrowing away their rifles, rushed forward with their tomahawks, making\r\ndreadful havoc; answering the cries for mercy with the hatchet, and\r\nadding to the universal consternation those terrific yells which invest\r\nsavage warfare with tenfold horror. So alert was the foe in his bloody\r\npursuit, that less than sixty of the Americans escaped either the rifle\r\nor the tomahawk. Of the militia officers, there fell one\r\nlieutenant-colonel, one major, ten captains, six lieutenants, and two\r\nensigns. Colonel Durkee and Captains Hewett and Ransom were likewise\r\nkilled. Some of the fugitives escaped by swimming the river, and others\r\nby flying to the mountains. As the news of the defeat spread down the\r\nvalley, the greater part of the women and children, and those who had\r\nremained to protect them, likewise ran to the woods and mountains, while\r\nthose who could not escape thus sought refuge in Fort Wyoming. The\r\nIndians, apparently wearied with pursuit and slaughter, desisted and\r\nbetook themselves to secure the spoils of the vanquished.\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of the 4th, the day after the battle, Colonel John\r\nButler, with the combined British and Indian forces, appeared before\r\nFort Wyoming and demanded its surrender. 'The inhabitants, both within\r\nand without the fort, did not on that emergency sustain a character for\r\ncourage becoming men of spirit in adversity. They were so intimidated as\r\nto give up without fighting; great numbers ran off; and those who\r\nremained all but betrayed Colonel Zebulon Butler, their commander' (Col.\r\nZ. Butler's letter). 'The British Colonel Butler sent several flags,\r\nrequiring an unconditional surrender of his opposing namesake and the\r\nfew continental troops yet remaining, but offering to spare the\r\ninhabitants their property and effects. But with the American colonel\r\nthe victor would not treat on any terms; and the people thereupon\r\ncompelled Colonel Dennison to comply with conditions which his commander\r\nhad refused.' The consequence was that Colonel Zebulon Butler contrived\r\nto escape from the fort with the remains of Captain Hewett's company of\r\nregulars (_Idem._), and Colonel Dennison entered into articles of\r\ncapitulation. 'By these it was stipulated that the settlers should be\r\ndisarmed, and their garrison demolished; that all prisoners and public\r\nstores should be given up; that the property of the people called Tories\r\nshould be made good, and they be permitted to remain peaceably upon\r\ntheir farms. In behalf of the settlers it was stipulated that their\r\nlives and property should be preserved, and that they should be left in\r\nthe unmolested occupancy of their farms' (Chapman's History).\r\n\r\n\"Unhappily, however, the British commander either could not or would not\r\nenforce the terms of capitulation (see page 91, where Mr. Hildreth says\r\nthat 'Colonel Butler, desirous to fulfil these terms of capitulation,\r\npresently marched away with his Tories, but he could not induce the\r\nIndians to follow. They remained behind, burned the houses, ravaged the\r\nfields, killed such as resisted, and drove the miserable women and\r\nchildren through the woods and mountains to seek refuge where they\r\nmight.'), which were to a great extent disregarded as well by the Tories\r\nas the Indians. Instead of finding protection, the valley was again laid\r\nwaste, the houses and improvements were destroyed by fire, and the\r\ncountry plundered. Families were broken up and dispersed, men and their\r\nwives separated, mothers torn from their children and some of them\r\ncarried into captivity, while far the greater number fled to the\r\nmountains, and wandered through the wilderness to the older settlements.\r\nSome died of their wounds, others from want and fatigue, while others\r\nwere still lost in the wilderness or were heard of no more. Several\r\nperished in a great swamp in the neighbourhood, which, from the\r\ncircumstance, acquired the name of 'the Shades of Death,' and retains it\r\nto this day. These were painful scenes. But it does not appear that\r\nanything like a massacre followed the capitulation.\" (Life of Joseph\r\nBrant, and Border Wars of the American Revolution, Vol. I., Chap. xv.,\r\npp. 334-336.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN RETALIATION FOR THE ALLEGED \"MASSACRE OF WYOMING,\" AS NARRATED\r\nBY AMERICAN HISTORIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now state from the same historical authorities the _revenge_\r\nwhich the continentals took for the \"Massacre of Wyoming.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Ramsay says: \"Soon after the destruction of the Wyoming settlement,\r\nan expedition was carried on against the Indians by Colonel Zebulon\r\nButler, of the Pennsylvania troops. He and his party having gained the\r\nhead of the Delaware, October 1st, marched down the river two days, and\r\nthen struck across the country to the Susquehanna. They burnt or\r\ndestroyed the Indian villages both in that quarter and the other\r\nsettlements; but the inhabitants escaped. The destruction was extended\r\nfor several miles on both sides of the Susquehanna. They completed the\r\nexpedition in sixteen days.\"[91]\r\n\r\nThis destruction of \"Indian villages\" and \"other settlements\" to the\r\nextent of \"several miles on both sides of the Susquehanna\" was more than\r\nan equivalent revenge for the destruction of Wyoming. But it was only\r\nthe beginning of vengeance and destruction, not only against the\r\nimmediate offenders in the case of Wyoming, but the pretext for a\r\nresolution and order of Congress itself for the entire destruction of\r\nthe Six Indian Nations, though their chiefs had held no council and\r\ngiven no order as to the attack upon the settlement of Wyoming, and had\r\nnothing to do with it, except that one of their tribes, with possibly a\r\nfew stragglers from some of the other tribes. With this exception, as is\r\nshown by the narratives above quoted, the Six Nations had no connection\r\nwith the destruction of Wyoming; were living quietly and industriously\r\non their well-cultivated farms, though friendly to the royal cause. Yet\r\nCongress, by an order which, we believe, has no parallel in the annals\r\nof any civilized nation, commands the complete destruction of those\r\npeople as a nation. It is cruel, indeed, and revolting to humanity, to\r\nkill and scalp ever so small a number of individuals, including women\r\nand children; but is it less cruel and revolting to render them\r\nhouseless by thousands, to destroy the fruits of their labours, to exile\r\nthem from their homes (after having destroyed them), and leave them to\r\nnakedness and starvation? Yet such was the case in the execution of the\r\norder of Congress for the extermination of the Six Nations.\r\n\r\n\"The determination,\" says Dr. Andrews, \"was now taken by Congress to\r\ndestroy this Indian nation. * * The intelligence of the preparations\r\nthat were making against them was received by the Indians with great\r\ncourage and firmness. * * They took a strong position in the most woody\r\nand mountainous part of the country, which they fortified with great\r\njudgment. * * General Sullivan attacked them in this encampment on the\r\n29th of August. They stood a hot cannonade for more than two hours; but\r\nthe breastwork of logs being almost destroyed, and the Americans having\r\nreached the top of the hill on their left, they were apprehensive of\r\nbeing surrounded, and retreated immediately with the utmost speed. * *\r\nThe behaviour of the Indians on this day was very courageous; they\r\nreturned the fire of the Americans with great spirit and regularity; and\r\nwould, it was thought, have maintained their ground had not the\r\nAmericans been provided with a train of artillery, to which the defeat\r\nof the Indians was principally owing. * * This engagement proved\r\ndecisive. After their trenches were forced, they fled without making any\r\nfurther endeavour to rally. They were pursued two or three miles; but\r\ntheir flight was so swift that they could not be overtaken. Their loss\r\nin slain and wounded was very considerable, though few prisoners were\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\"The consternation occasioned among the Indians by this defeat was such,\r\nthat they lost all hope of retrieving their fortunes, and dropped all\r\nidea of further resistance. As the Americans advanced, they retreated\r\nbefore them with the utmost precipitation, and suffered them to proceed,\r\nwithout any obstruction, in the destructive operations they were\r\ncommissioned to perform.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuance of the orders he had received, General Sullivan penetrated\r\ninto the heart of the country inhabited by the Five Nations, spreading\r\neverywhere the most extensive desolation. His letter to the Congress,\r\ngiving an account of the progress and proceedings of the army under his\r\ncommand, was as complete a journal of destruction as ever was penned. No\r\nless than forty towns and settlements were destroyed, besides detached\r\nhabitations. All their fields of corn and all their orchards and\r\nplantations; whatever, in short, was in a state of cultivation,\r\nunderwent the same fate. The devastation was such, that on the American\r\narmy's leaving that country not a house was left standing to their\r\nknowledge, nor an Indian to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Such was the issue of this celebrated expedition, undertaken by way of\r\nretaliation for the outrages which the Indians (Senecas) had committed\r\non the frontiers, and particularly in destroying the unfortunate\r\nsettlement of Wyoming during the preceding summer.\r\n\r\n\"What rendered this total ruin of the country possessed by the Five\r\nNations the more remarkable was the degree of knowledge and expertness\r\nin agriculture and in various domestic arts to which it was now for the\r\nfirst time discovered that the Indians had attained. It appeared by\r\nGeneral Sullivan's account that the lands about the towns were\r\nexcellently cultivated, and their houses large and elegantly\r\nconstructed. The extent of their industry may be conjectured by his\r\nasserting that the quantity of corn destroyed could not, by a moderate\r\ncomputation, amount to less than 160,000 bushels; that their orchards\r\nwere so well stocked that no less than 1,500 trees were cut down in one\r\norchard only, numbers of which had evidently been planted many years;\r\nand that their garden grounds contained immense quantities of vegetables\r\nof every kind.\"[92]\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft represents what he in one place terms \"the great\r\nexpedition\" as a mere raid for the chastisement of the Seneca Indians.\r\nHe says: \"Moved by the massacres of Wyoming and Cherry Valley, Congress,\r\non the 25th of February, had directed Washington to protect the inland\r\nfrontiers and chastise the Seneca Indians. * * The best part of the\r\nseason was gone when Sullivan, on the last of July, moved from Wyoming.\r\nHis arrival at Tioga sent terror to the Indians. * * Several of the\r\nchiefs said to Colonel Bolton, in council, 'Why does not the great king,\r\nour father, assist us? Our villages will be cut off, and we can no\r\nlonger fight his battles.'\r\n\r\n\"On the 22nd of August, the day after he was joined by New York troops\r\nunder General James Clinton, Sullivan began his march up the Tioga into\r\nthe heart of the Indian country. On the same day, Little David, a Mohawk\r\nchief, delivered a message from himself and the Six Nations to General\r\nHaldimand, then Governor of Canada: 'Brother! for these three years past\r\nthe Six Nations have been running a race against fresh enemies, and are\r\nalmost out of breath. Now we shall see whether you are our loving strong\r\nbrother, or whether you deceive us. Brother! we are still strong for the\r\nKing of England, if you will show us that he is a man of his word, and\r\nthat he will not abandon his brothers the Six Nations.' * * The march\r\ninto the country of the Senecas, on the left, extended to Genesee; on\r\nthe right, detachments reached Cayuga lake. After destroying eighteen\r\nvillages and their fields of corn, Sullivan, whose army had suffered for\r\nwant of supplies, returned to New Jersey.\"[93]\r\n\r\nMr. Hildreth's account of this expedition, though brief, is more\r\ncomprehensive and satisfactory than that of Mr. Bancroft. Mr. Hildreth\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The command of the enterprise against the Indians, declined by Gates,\r\nwas given to Sullivan. Three brigades from the main army, under Poor,\r\nHand, and Maxwell--New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey\r\ntroops--were assembled at Wyoming. A New York brigade ('upwards of 1,000\r\nmen,' says Dr. Ramsay), under General James Clinton, hitherto employed\r\nin guarding the frontier of that State, crossed from the Mohawk to Lake\r\nOtsego (one of the sources of the Susquehanna), dammed the lake, and so\r\nraised its level, and then by breaking away the dam produced an\r\nartificial flood, by the aid of which the boats were rapidly carried\r\ndown the north-east branch of the Susquehanna, to form a junction with\r\nSullivan. * *\r\n\r\n\"Sullivan's army, amounting to 5,000 men, passed up the Chemung branch\r\nof the Susquehanna. At Newton, now Elmira, they encountered a strong\r\nbody of the enemy,[94] partly Indians and partly Tories, under Brant,\r\nthe Butlers and Johnson, entrenched on a rising ground and disposed in\r\nambuscade. Sullivan detached Poor to gain the rear, while he attacked\r\nthem in front with artillery. Having put them to rout, he crossed to\r\nthe hitherto unexplored valley of the Genesee. That want of food might\r\ncompel the Indians and their Tory allies to emigrate, everything was\r\nravaged. The ancient Indian orchards were cut down; many bushels of corn\r\nwere destroyed, and eighteen villages, composed largely of frame houses,\r\nwere burned. Provisions failed. Such at least was the reason that\r\nSullivan gave, and the attack upon Niagara, the great object of the\r\nenterprise, was abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"A simultaneous expedition from Pittsburg ascended the Alleghany, and\r\nvisited with similar devastation all the villages along the river.\r\nPending these operations, and to prevent any aid from Canada, divers\r\nartifices were employed by Washington to create the belief of an\r\nintended invasion of that province.\"[95]\r\n\r\nThe account of this expedition given by Dr. Ramsay corresponds, with\r\nsome additional particulars, with that given by Dr. Andrews, as above\r\nquoted, and almost in the same words. He says:\r\n\r\n\"The Indians who form the confederacy of the Six Nations, commonly\r\ncalled Mohawks, were the objects of this expedition. They inhabit that\r\nimmense and fertile tract of country which lies between New England, the\r\nMiddle States, and the Province of Canada. * * The Indians, on hearing\r\nof the expedition projected against them, acted with firmness. They\r\ncollected their strength, took possession of proper ground, and\r\nfortified it with judgment. General Sullivan, on the 29th of August,\r\nattacked them in their works. They stood a cannonade for more than two\r\nhours, but then gave way. This engagement proved decisive. After the\r\ntrenches were forced, the Indians fled without making any attempt to\r\nrally. The consternation occasioned among them by this defeat was so\r\ngreat, that they gave up all ideas of further resistance. As the\r\nAmericans advanced into their settlements, the Indians retreated before\r\nthem, without throwing any obstruction in their way. General Sullivan\r\npenetrated into the heart of the country inhabited by the Mohawks, and\r\nspread desolation everywhere. Many settlements in the form of towns were\r\ndestroyed. All their fields of corn, and whatever was in a state of\r\ncultivation, underwent the same fate. Scarcely anything in the form of\r\na house was left standing, nor was an Indian to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"To the surprise of the Americans, they found the lands about the Indian\r\ntowns well cultivated, and their houses both large and commodious. The\r\nquantity of corn destroyed was immense. Orchards, in which were several\r\nhundred fruit trees, were cut down; and of them many appeared to have\r\nbeen planted for a long series of years. Their gardens, replenished with\r\na variety of useful vegetables, were laid waste.\"[96]\r\n\r\nFrom this review of the invasions and contests between the Americans and\r\nIndians, it is clear that the Indians were the greater sufferers in life\r\nand property. The mutual hatreds of former years, when the colonies were\r\nwarring with the French (instead of being, as now, in alliance with\r\nthem), and the Indians were in the interest and service of the French,\r\nseems to have been perpetuated on both sides, and to have become more\r\nintense on the part of the Americans after the failure of their efforts\r\nto secure the Indians to their side. The old contests between the\r\nSouthern colonists and the Indians were renewed and repeated with\r\nintense bitterness; and in the Northern colonies the policy of Congress\r\nand its agents was to crush and exterminate the Indians altogether. In\r\nacts of individual cruelty, their historical and characteristic mode of\r\nwar, the Indians exceeded the Americans; but in acts of wholesale\r\ndestruction of life and property, the Americans far outdid the Indians,\r\nadopting the Indian instead of a civilized mode of warfare, and\r\nincluding in their sweep of destruction women and children as well as\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe employment of Indians at all on the part of Great Britain against\r\nthe colonists, is, in our opinion, the blackest crime recorded in the\r\nannals of the British Government, prompted apparently by the cowardly\r\nand execrable General Gage, but condemned by Generals Carleton and\r\nBurgoyne, as well as by General Howe. The use, however, which the\r\nAmericans sought to make of the Indians, and their cruel and\r\nexterminating mode of warfare against them, leave them no ground of\r\nboasting on the score of humanity against either the British Government\r\nor the Indians.\r\n\r\nTo this may be added the unfortunate condition and treatment of the\r\nLoyalists or \"Tories\" among the Indians. For adhering, or suspected of\r\nadhering to the faith of their fathers, and even of the present\r\npersecution down to within less than six years, they were, however\r\npeaceably they might be living, driven from their homes and their\r\nproperty seized and alienated, and they left no place for the soles of\r\ntheir feet except among the Indians, and then termed monsters and\r\ntreated as traitors, for joining their protectors in the defence of\r\ntheir places of refuge, and, as far as possible, for the recovery of\r\ntheir homes. What else, as men, as human beings, could they do? They\r\nwere denied and banished from the homes which they had, unless they\r\nwould reverse their political faith and oath of allegiance, and forswear\r\nallegiance, to enrol themselves in arms against the country of their\r\nforefathers and of their affection. They could not but be chafed with\r\nthe loss of their freedom of speech and of conviction of their\r\ncitizenship and their property, and of being driven into exile; and they\r\nmust have been more or less than men had they not acted loyally and to\r\nthe best of their ability with their protectors, however abhorrent to\r\ntheir views and feelings were many acts of the Indians--acts imitated\r\nand even excelled, in so many respects, by the Americans themselves, in\r\ntheir depredations into the Indian territories.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL STONE'S ACCOUNT, IN DETAIL, OF GENERAL SULLIVAN'S EXPEDITION OF\r\nEXTERMINATION OF THE SIX NATIONS OF INDIANS.\r\n\r\nIn his _Life of Brant, including the Border Wars of the American\r\nRevolution_, Colonel Stone gives a much more elaborate account of this\r\nexpedition of destruction against the Six Nations, or rather the Five\r\nNations, for the Oneidas and some of the Tuscaroras joined the\r\nAmericans. Colonel Stone narrates the progress and work of General\r\nSullivan from place to place. We will add a few extracts from his\r\nnarrative, after some preliminary explanations.\r\n\r\nColonel Stone corrects a very common error, which views the whole race\r\nof North American Indians as essentially alike--\"all as the same roving,\r\nrestless, houseless race of hunters and fishermen, without a local\r\nhabitation and with scarce a name.\" He gives examples of the varieties\r\nof Indian character, not less marked than between the English and the\r\nFrench--some following the buffalo in his migrations, others finding a\r\nprecarious subsistence in the forest chase, others again fishing and\r\ntrapping; tribes who pass most of their time in canoes, while others,\r\nwoodland tribes, cultivate the soil, and gradually become organized, and\r\nacquire a higher state of civilization, and present a marked difference\r\nof character and taste from the hunter and fishermen tribes. \"This\r\nhigher state of social organization among the Six Nations,\" says Colonel\r\nStone \"greatly increased the difference. They had many towns and\r\nvillages giving evidence of perseverance. They were organized into\r\ncommunities whose social and political institutions, simple as they\r\nwere, were still as distinct and well-defined as those of the American\r\nConfederacy. They had now acquired some arts, and were enjoying many of\r\nthe comforts of civilized life. Not content with small patches of\r\ncleared lands for the raising of a few vegetables, they possessed\r\ncultivated fields and orchards of great productiveness at the West.\r\nEspecially was this the fact with regard to the Cayugas and Senecas. The\r\nMohawks having been driven from their own rich lands (in the valley of\r\nthe Mohawk and Susquehanna rivers), the extensive domains of the\r\nwesternmost tribes of the confederacy (in the Genesee country) formed\r\nthe granary of the whole. And in consequence of the superior social and\r\npolitical organization just referred to, and the Spartan-like character\r\nincident to the forest life, the Six Nations, though not the most\r\nnumerous, were beyond doubt the most formidable of the tribes then in\r\nalliance with the Crown. It was justly considered, therefore, that the\r\nonly way _to strike them effectively would be to destroy their homes_\r\nand the growing produce of their farms, and thus, _by cutting off their\r\nmeans of supply, drive them from their own country deeper into the\r\ninterior, and perhaps throw them altogether upon their British allies\r\nfor subsistence_.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts will go far to account for the desire of the Mohawks to\r\nrecover the homes from which they had been driven, and for the relations\r\nbetween the Six Nations to the Crown of Great Britain and the revolting\r\nportion of the colonists.\r\n\r\nIt has been intimated that the Oneida Indians and part of the Onondagos\r\nadhered to the revolting colonists. Colonel Stone observes: \"It was the\r\nintention of General Sullivan that General Clinton should employ in his\r\ndivision as large a number of the Oneida warriors as could be induced to\r\nengage in the service. The latter officer was opposed to this\r\narrangement; but through the importunities of Sullivan, the Rev. Mr.\r\nKirkland, their missionary, who was now a chaplain in the army, had been\r\nsummoned to Albany for consultation. From thence Mr. Kirkland was\r\ndespatched to Pennsylvania, directly to join Sullivan's division; while\r\nto Mr. Deane, the interpreter connected with the Indian Commissioner at\r\nFort Schuyler (formerly Fort Stanwix), was confided the charge of\r\nnegotiating with the Oneida chiefs on the subject. The Oneidas\r\nvolunteered for the expedition almost to a man; while those of the\r\nOnondagos who adhered to the cause of the Americans were equally\r\ndesirous of proving their fidelity by their deeds. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Clinton wrote to Sullivan on the 26th, that on the\r\nfollowing Saturday Mr. Deane, with the Indian warriors, would join him\r\nat the head of the lake. A sudden revolution, however, was wrought in\r\ntheir determination by an address to the Oneidas from General Haldimand\r\n(Governor of Canada), received at Fort Schuyler the 22nd. This document\r\nwas transmitted to them in their own language; and its tenor was so\r\nalarming as to induce them suddenly to change their purpose, judging\r\nvery correctly, from the threats of Haldimand, that their presence was\r\nnecessary at home for the defence of their own castles. Still Mr. Deane\r\nwrote that an arrangement was on foot by which he hoped to obtain the\r\nco-operation of a considerable number of the Oneida warriors.\"\r\n\r\n\"General Haldimand's address was written in the Iroquois (Mohawk)\r\nlanguage, of which a translation was made by Mr. Deane and enclosed to\r\nGeneral Clinton.\"\r\n\r\nIn this address General Haldimand charged the Oneida Indians with having\r\n\"taken a different course from the rest of the Five Nations, your\r\nconfederates, and have likewise deserted the King's cause through the\r\ndeceitful machinations and snares of the rebels, who intimidated you\r\nwith their numerous armies, by which means you became bewildered and\r\nforgot all your engagements with and former care and favour from the\r\nGreat King of England, your Father. You also soon forgot the frequent\r\nbad usage and continual encroachments of the Americans upon the Indian\r\nlands throughout the continent. I say, therefore, that at the breaking\r\nout of these troubles, you firmly declared to _observe a strict\r\nneutrality in the dispute_, and made your declaration known to Sir Guy\r\nCarleton, my predecessor, _who much approved of it, provided you were in\r\nearnest_.[97] I have hitherto strictly observed and examined your\r\nconduct, and find that you did not adhere to your assertion, although I\r\ncould trace no reason, on the side of Government as well as the Indians,\r\nwhy you should act so treacherous and double a part; by which means we,\r\nnot mistrusting your fidelity, have had many losses among the King's\r\nsubjects, and the Five Nations, your friends and connections.\"\r\n\r\nAfter further reproaches, admonitions, and threatenings, General\r\nHaldimand concluded in the following severe words: \"These are facts,\r\nBrothers, that, unless you are lost to every sense of feeling, cannot\r\nbut recall in you even a most hearty repentance and deep remorse for\r\nyour past vile actions.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of General Haldimand's address was to cause a conference--Mr.\r\nDeane, at the head of thirty-five Oneida warriors--with General Clinton,\r\nto apologize for the absence of their brethren from the expedition, and\r\nto make those explanations in regard to their own situation already\r\ncommunicated by Mr. Deane by letter, together with the address of\r\nGeneral Haldimand. In his reply, General Clinton, among other things,\r\nsaid: \"It is not my desire that the whole of your warriors should leave\r\ntheir castles. I have given a general invitation to our brethren the\r\nOneidas, the Tuscaroras, and such of the Onondagos as have entered into\r\nfriendship with us. In order to give all our Indian friends an equal\r\nchance of evidencing their spirit and determination to partake of our\r\nfortune, I am entirely satisfied that such only should join me as think\r\nproper.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Stone, after stating that on the 22nd of August General Clinton\r\narrived at Tioga, and formed a junction with General Sullivan, says:\r\n\"The entire command amounted to 5,000, consisting of the brigades of\r\nGenerals Clinton, Hand, Maxwell, and Poor, together with Proctor's\r\nartillery and a corps of riflemen.\" Then, after relating the battle of\r\nNewton (the present site of Elmira), as described in extracts from the\r\nhistorians in previous pages, Colonel Stone narrates the progress and\r\nwork of the invading army of extermination and destruction. We give the\r\nfollowing extracts from his narrative:\r\n\r\n\"It is apprehended that but few of the present generation are thoroughly\r\naware of the advances which the Indians, in the wide and beautiful\r\ncountry of the Cayugas and Senecas, had made in the march of\r\ncivilization. They had several towns and many large villages laid out\r\nwith a considerable degree of regularity. They had framed houses, some\r\nof them well furnished, having chimneys, and painted. They had broad and\r\nproductive fields; and in addition to an abundance of apples, were in\r\nthe enjoyment of the pear, and the still more delicious peach. But after\r\nthe battle of Newton, the Indians everywhere fled at Sullivan's\r\nadvance, and the whole country was swept as with a besom of destruction.\r\nOn the 4th (September), as the army advanced, they destroyed a small\r\nsettlement of eight houses, and two days afterwards reached the more\r\nconsiderable town of Kendaia, containing about twenty houses, neatly\r\nbuilt and well finished. These were reduced to ashes, and the army spent\r\nnearly a day in destroying the fields of corn and the fruit trees. Of\r\nthese there were great abundance, and many of them appeared to be\r\nancient.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 7th, Sullivan crossed the outlet of Seneca Lake, and moved in\r\nthree divisions upon the town of Kanadaseagea, the Seneca capital,\r\ncontaining about sixty houses, with gardens and numerous orchards of\r\napple and peach trees. It was Sullivan's object to surround the town and\r\ntake it by surprise. But although Butler had endeavoured to induce the\r\nIndians to make a stand at the place, his importunities were of no\r\navail. They said it was no use to contend with such an army; and their\r\ncapital was consequently abandoned as the other towns had been before\r\nthe Americans could reach it. A detachment of 400 men was sent down on\r\nthe west side of the lake to destroy Gotheseunquean, and the plantations\r\nin the neighbourhood; while at the same time a number of volunteers,\r\nunder Colonel Harper, made a forced march in the direction of Cayuga\r\nLake, and destroyed Schoyere. Meantime the residue of the army was\r\nemployed, on the 8th, in the destruction of the town, together with the\r\nfruit trees and fields of corn and beans. Here, as elsewhere, _the work\r\nof destruction was thorough and complete_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The main army then moved forward upon Kanandaigua, at which place it\r\narrived in two days. Here they 'found twenty-three very elegant houses,\r\nmostly framed, and in general large, together with very extensive fields\r\nof corn--all of which were destroyed. From Kanandaigua they proceeded to\r\nthe small town of Honeoye, consisting of ten houses, which were\r\nimmediately burnt to the ground. A post was established by General\r\nSullivan at Honeoye, to maintain which a strong garrison was left, with\r\nheavy stores and one field-piece. With this precautionary measure the\r\narmy prepared to advance upon the yet more considerable town of\r\nGenesee--the great capital of the western tribes of the\r\nconfederacy--containing their stores and their broadest cultivated\r\nfields.\"\r\n\r\n\"The valley of the Genesee, for its beauty and fertility, was beheld by\r\nthe army of Sullivan with astonishment and delight. Though an Indian\r\ncountry, and peopled only by wild men of the woods, its rich intervales\r\npresented the appearance of long cultivation, and were then smiling with\r\nthe harvests of ripening corn. Indeed, the Indians themselves professed\r\nnot to know when or by whom the lands upon that stream were first\r\nbrought into cultivation. Instead of a howling wilderness, Sullivan and\r\nhis troops found the Genesee flats, and many other districts of the\r\ncountry, resembling much more the orchards and farms and gardens of\r\ncivilized life. But all was now doomed to speedy devastation. The\r\nGenesee Castle was destroyed. The troops scoured the whole region round\r\nabout, and burnt and destroyed everything that came in their way. The\r\ntown of Genesee contained 128 houses, mostly large and very elegant. It\r\nwas beautifully situated, almost encircled with a clear flat, extending\r\na number of miles, over which extensive fields of corn were waving,\r\ntogether with every kind of vegetable that could be conceived. But the\r\nentire army was immediately engaged in destroying it, and the axe and\r\nthe torch soon transformed the whole of that beautiful region from the\r\ncharacter of a garden to a scene of sickening desolation. Forty Indian\r\ntowns, the largest containing 128 houses, were destroyed. Corn, gathered\r\nand ungathered, to the amount of 160,000 bushels, shared the same fate;\r\nthe fruit trees were cut down; and the Indians were hunted like wild\r\nbeasts, till neither house, nor fruit tree, nor field of corn, nor\r\ninhabitant remained in the whole country. The gardens were enriched with\r\ngreat quantities of useful vegetables of different kinds. The size of\r\nthe corn-fields, as well as the high degree of cultivation, excited\r\nwonder, and the ears of corn were so remarkably large that many of them\r\nmeasured twenty-two inches in length. So numerous were the fruit trees,\r\nthat in one orchard they cut down 1,500.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having completed the objects contemplated by the expedition to the\r\npoint at which he had arrived, General Sullivan recrossed the Genesee\r\nwith his army the 16th of September, and set out on his return. Why he\r\ndid not follow up his success, and strike the enemy's citadel at\r\nNiagara, which at that time was in no situation for formidable\r\nresistance, is a question difficult of solution. Unquestionably, in the\r\norganization of the expedition, the conquest of Niagara, the\r\nheadquarters of the foe of all descriptions, and the seat of British\r\ninfluence and power among the Indians, was one of the principal objects\r\nin view. Certain it is, that the most important feature of the\r\nenterprise was not undertaken; and it will be seen in the sequel that\r\nbut small ultimate advantage resulted from the campaign. Stimulated by a\r\nkeener thirst for revenge, clouds of savages were again and again seen\r\nto sweep through the valley of the Mohawk with the scalping knife and\r\nthe torch.\"\r\n\r\n\"The return of the army was along the same tract by which it had\r\nadvanced. On the 20th, having recrossed the outlet of Seneca Lake,\r\nColonel Zebulon Butler was detached with the rifle corps of 500 men to\r\npass round the foot of Cayuga Lake, and lay waste the Indian towns on\r\nits eastern shore; while Lieutenant-Colonel Dearborn, with 200 men, was\r\ndetached to perform the same service on the south-western shore. The\r\nmain army pursued the most direct route to the Chemung and Tioga. On the\r\n26th Colonel Dearborn's detachment returned, and on the 28th they were\r\nrejoined by Colonel Zebulon Butler, who had burnt three towns of the\r\nCayugas, including their capital. Dearborn had burnt six towns in his\r\nroute, destroying at the same time large quantities of corn. On the same\r\nday, Colonels Van Courtlandt and Dayton were detached upon a similar\r\nservice--for the destruction of large fields of corn growing upon the\r\nbanks of the Tioga and its tributaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"The army then resumed its march, and passing through Wyoming, arrived\r\nat Easton on the 15th of October. The distance thence to Genesee Castle\r\nwas 280 miles. With the exception of the action at Newton, the\r\nachievements of the army in battle were not great. But it had scoured a\r\nbroad extent of country, and had laid more towns in ashes than had ever\r\nbeen destroyed on the continent before. The red men were driven from\r\ntheir beautiful country, their habitations left in ruins, their fields\r\nlaid waste, their orchards uprooted, and their altars and the tombs of\r\ntheir fathers overthrown.\"[98]\r\n\r\nAll the devastations of settlements, burnings and slaughter committed by\r\nthe \"Tories and Indians\" during the whole war shrink into insignificance\r\nin regard to extent of territory, the number of inhabitants and towns,\r\nthe extent of cultivated farms and gardens, when compared with General\r\nSullivan's one vast sweep of ruin and misery, in the course of which, as\r\nthe historian says, \"_the Indians were hunted like wild beasts, till\r\nneither house nor fruit tree, nor field of corn nor inhabitant, remained\r\nin the whole country_.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was done by an express order of Congress to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief; and for doing this General Sullivan and his army\r\nreceived the cordial approbation and thanks of the Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was very natural that the survivors of the Six Nations and the\r\n\"Tories,\" who took refuge and resided among them, should seek revenge on\r\nevery possible occasion, in months following, in the regions of their\r\nown sufferings, especially upon those individuals and communities who\r\nthey knew had prompted and aided the executioners of Congress. There\r\nwere partizan leaders, with adventurous followers, on both sides, in the\r\nSouthern as well as in the Northern States, who inflicted many acts of\r\nbarbarity and desolation; but these retaliatory cruelties and raids of\r\ndestruction acquired a greater intensity of bitterness and cruelty after\r\nthe terrible ravages and cruelties perpetrated by General Sullivan and\r\nhis army.\r\n\r\nBesides, the history of the Indians, as well as of the \"Tories,\"\r\nthroughout the whole war, was written by their adversaries, and it was\r\nconsidered a master-stroke of policy to exaggerate the alleged misdeeds\r\nand paint the character of both the Indians and Tories in the blackest\r\ncolours. The story of the \"Massacre of Wyoming\" is a sample of the\r\nmanner in which the American writers of the day made history against the\r\nIndians and the \"Tories.\" When facts could not be sufficiently seasoned\r\nto stimulate recruits for the army and appropriations from the people\r\nfor its support, fiction pure and simple was resorted to; and Dr.\r\nFranklin himself did not think it unworthy of his antecedents, age and\r\nposition to employ this method to bring disrepute upon the \"Tories,\" the\r\nIndians, and the British Government itself, and to excite the hatred of\r\nhis countrymen against them. The accomplished author of the _Life of\r\nBrant and the Border Wars of the American Revolution_ forcibly observes:\r\n\r\n\"The Indians of the Six Nations, in common with their chief, were loaded\r\nwith execrations for atrocities of which all were alike innocent,\r\nbecause the deeds recorded were never committed, it having been the\r\npolicy of the public writers and those in authority, not only to magnify\r\nactual occurrences, but sometimes, when those were wanting, to draw upon\r\ntheir imaginations for such deeds of ferocity and bloodshed as might\r\nbest serve to keep alive the strongest feelings of indignation against\r\nthe parent country, and likewise induce the people to take the field in\r\nrevenge, if not driven thither by the nobler impulse of patriotism.\"[99]\r\n\r\nSuch deliberate fictions, for political purposes, as that by Dr.\r\nFranklin, just referred to, were probably rare; but the investigations\r\ninto which the author has been, in the preparation of the present work,\r\nhave satisfied him that, from other causes, much exaggeration and\r\nfalsehood has obtained a permanent footing in American history. Most\r\nhistorians of that period, English and American, wrote too near the time\r\nwhen the events they were describing occurred, for a dispassionate\r\ninvestigation of the truth; and other writers who have succeeded, have\r\ntoo often been content to follow the beaten track, without incurring the\r\nlabour of diligent and calm inquiry. Reference has been made above to\r\nWyoming, concerning which, to this day, the world has been abused with\r\nmonstrous fictions, with tales of horror never enacted. Nor were the\r\nexaggerations in regard to the invasion of Wyoming greater than were\r\nthose connected with the irruption into and destruction of Cherry\r\nValley, as the reader will discover in the course of the ensuing pages.\r\nIndeed, the writer, in preparation of materials for this work, has\r\nencountered so much that is false recorded in history as sober verity,\r\nthat he has at times been disposed almost to universal scepticism in\r\nregard to uninspired narration.\r\n\r\nThe \"deliberate fictions, for political purposes, by Dr. Franklin,\" as\r\nthe biographer of Brant expresses it, \"were written as facts;\" or, as\r\nthe author quoted expresses it, \"the well-known scalp story of Dr.\r\nFranklin was long believed, and recently revived and included in several\r\nbooks of authentic history.\" The details of Dr. Franklin's publication\r\nwere so minute and varied as to create a belief that they were perfectly\r\ntrue. \"It was long supposed to be authentic,\" as the author quoted says\r\nin introducing the document, in Appendix No. 1 to Volume I., \"but has\r\nsince been ascertained to be a publication from the pen of Dr. Franklin,\r\nfor political purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe names introduced are of course fictitious, as well as the\r\nstatements, but introduced with such an air of plausibility as to\r\npreclude the suspicion that they were fictitious. The publication will\r\nbe a curiosity to most of the readers of these pages, as it has been to\r\nthe writer. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n_Extract of a letter from Captain Gerrish, of the New England Militia,\r\ndated Albany, March 7th_, 1782:\r\n\r\n\"The peltry taken in the expedition will, as you see, amount to a good\r\ndeal of money. The possession of this booty at first gave us pleasure;\r\nbut we were struck with horror to find among the packages eight large\r\nones, containing scalps of our unhappy folks taken in the last three\r\nyears by the Seneca Indians, from the inhabitants of the frontiers of\r\nNew York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and sent by them as a\r\npresent to Colonel Haldimand, Governor of Canada, in order to be\r\ntransmitted by him to England. They were accompanied by the following\r\ncurious letter to that gentleman:\r\n\r\n\"TIOGA, January 3rd, 1782.\r\n\r\n\"May it please Your Excellency,\r\n\r\n\"At the request of the Seneca chiefs, I send herewith to your\r\nExcellency, under the care of James Boyd, eight packs of scalps, cured,\r\ndried, hooped, and painted with all the Indian triumphal marks, of which\r\nthe following is invoice and explanation:\r\n\r\n\"No. 1, containing forty-three scalps of Congress soldiers killed in\r\ndifferent skirmishes; these are stretched on black hoops, four inch\r\ndiameter; the inside of the skin painted red, with a small black spot to\r\nnote their being killed with bullets. Also sixty-two farmers, killed in\r\ntheir houses, the hoops red; the skin painted brown, and marked with a\r\nhoe; a black circle all round, to denote their being surprised in the\r\nnight; and a black hatchet in the middle, signifying their being killed\r\nwith that weapon.\r\n\r\n\"No. 2, containing ninety-eight farmers killed in their houses; hoops\r\nred; figure of a hoe, to mark their profession; great white circle and\r\nsun, to show they were surprised in the daytime; a _little red foot_,\r\nto show they stood upon their defence, and died fighting for their lives\r\nand families.\r\n\r\n\"No. 3, containing ninety-seven farmers; hoops green, to show they were\r\nkilled in the fields; a large white circle, with a little round mark on\r\nit for the sun, to show that it was in the daytime; black bullet mark on\r\nsome, hatchet on others.\r\n\r\n\"No. 4, containing 102 farmers, mixed of the several marks above; only\r\neighteen marked with a little yellow flame, to denote their being\r\nprisoners burnt alive, after being scalped, their nails pulled out by\r\nthe roots, and other torments; one of these latter supposed to be of a\r\nrebel clergyman; his band being fixed to the hoop of his scalp. Most of\r\nthe farmers appear by the hair to be young or middle-aged men; there\r\nbeing but sixty-seven grey heads among them all, which makes the service\r\nmore essential.\r\n\r\n\"No. 5, containing eighty-eight scalps of women; hair long, braided in\r\nthe Indian fashion, to show they were mothers; hoops blue; skin yellow\r\nground, with red tadpoles, to represent, by way of triumph, the tears of\r\ngrief occasioned to their relations; a black scalping-knife or hatchet\r\nat the bottom, to mark their being killed with these instruments;\r\nseventeen others, hair very grey; black hoops; plain brown colour, no\r\nmark but the short club or cassetete, to show that they were knocked\r\ndown dead, or had their brains beat out.\r\n\r\n\"No. 6, containing 193 boys' scalps, of various ages; small green hoops;\r\nwhitish ground on the skin, with red tears in the middle, and black\r\nbullet marks, knife, hatchet, or club, as their death happened.\r\n\r\n\"No. 7, 211 girls' scalps, big and little; small yellow hoops; white\r\nground; tears, hatchet, club, scalping knife, etc.\r\n\r\n\"No. 8.

The Great King's enemies are many, and they grow fast in number.\r\nThey were formerly like young panthers; they could neither bite nor\r\nscratch; we could play with them safely; we feared nothing they could do\r\nto us. But now their bodies are become big as the elk and strong as the\r\nbuffalo; they have also got great and sharp claws. They have driven us\r\nout of our country by taking part in your quarrel. We expect the Great\r\nKing will give us another country, that our children may live after us,\r\nand be his friends and children as we are. Say this for us to the Great\r\nKing. To enforce it we give this belt.--A great white belt with blue\r\ntassels.\r\n\r\n\"'_Father!_--We have only to say further, that your traders exact more\r\nthan ever for their goods; and our hunting is lessened by the war, so\r\nthat we have fewer skins to give for them. This ruins us. Think of some\r\nremedy. We are poor, and you have plenty of everything. We know you will\r\nsend us powder and guns, and knives and hatchets; but we also want\r\nshirts and blankets.--A little white belt.'\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt but that your Excellency will think it proper to give\r\nsome further encouragement to those honest people. The high prices they\r\ncomplain of are the necessary effect of the war. Whatever presents may\r\nbe sent for them through my hands shall be distributed with prudence and\r\nfidelity. I have the honour of being\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\"JAMES CRAUFURD.\"\r\n\r\nThis chapter of Congress vengeance to exterminate the Six Nations of\r\nIndians, and of its writers to picture them as human monsters, cannot be\r\nbetter concluded than in the words of the historian of Brant,[100] and\r\nof the Border Wars of the American Revolution:\r\n\r\n\"No Indian pen traces the history of their tribes and nations, or\r\nrecords the deeds of their warriors and chiefs, their prowess and their\r\nwrongs. Their spoilers have been their historians; and although a\r\nreluctant assent has been awarded to some of the nobler traits of their\r\nnature, yet, without yielding a due allowance for the peculiarities of\r\ntheir situation, the Indian character has been presented with singular\r\nuniformity as being cold, cruel, morose, and revengeful; unrelieved by\r\nany of those varying traits and characteristics, those lights and\r\nshadows which are admitted in respect to other people no less wild and\r\nuncivilized than they.\r\n\r\n\"Without pausing to reflect that, even when most cruel, they have been\r\npractising the trade of war--always dreadful--as much in conformity to\r\ntheir own usages and laws as have their more civilized antagonists, the\r\nwhite historian has drawn them with the characteristics of demons.\r\nForgetting that the second of Hebrew monarchs did not scruple to saw his\r\nprisoners with saws, and harrow them with harrows of iron; forgetful\r\nlikewise of the scenes of Smithfield, under the direction of our own\r\nBritish ancestors; the historians of the poor untutored Indians, almost\r\nwith one accord, have denounced them as monsters _sui generis_, of\r\nunparalleled and unapproachable barbarity; as though the summary\r\ntomahawk were worse than the iron tortures of the harrow, and the torch\r\nof the Mohawk hotter than the faggots of Queen Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Nor does it seem to have occurred to the 'pale-faced' writers that the\r\nidentical cruelties, the records and descriptions of which enter so\r\nlargely into the composition of the earlier volumes of American history,\r\nwere not barbarities in the estimation of those who practised them. _The\r\nscalp lock was an emblem of chivalry._ Every warrior shaving his head\r\nfor battle was careful to leave _the lock of defiance upon his crown_,\r\nas for the bravado, 'Take it if you can.' The stake and the torture\r\nwere identified with their rude notions of the power of endurance. They\r\nwere inflicted upon captives of their own race, as well as upon whites;\r\nand with their own braves these trials were courted, to enable the\r\nsufferer to exhibit the courage and fortitude with which they could be\r\nborne--the proud scorn with which all the pain that a foe might inflict\r\ncould be endured.\r\n\r\n\"But (it is said) they fell upon slumbering hamlets in the night and\r\nmassacred defenceless women and children. This, again, was their own\r\nmode of warfare, as honourable in their estimation as the more courteous\r\nmethods of committing wholesale murder laid down in the books.\r\n\r\n\"But of one enormity they were ever innocent. Whatever degree of\r\npersonal hardship and suffering their female captives were compelled to\r\nendure, their persons were never dishonoured by violence; a fact which\r\ncan be predicated, we apprehend, of no other victorious soldiery that\r\never lived.\r\n\r\n\"In regard, moreover, to the countless acts of cruelty alleged to have\r\nbeen perpetrated by the savages, it must still be borne in mind that the\r\nIndians have had no writer to relate their own side of the story. The\r\nannals of man, probably, do not attest a more kindly reception of\r\nintruding foreigners than was given to the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth\r\nby the faithful Massassoit, and the tribes under his jurisdiction. Nor\r\ndid the forest kings take up arms until they but too clearly saw that\r\neither their visitors or themselves must be driven from the soil which\r\nwas their own--the fee of which was derived from the Great Spirit. And\r\nthe nation is yet to be discovered that will not fight for their homes,\r\nthe graves of their fathers, and their family altars. Cruel they were in\r\nthe prosecution of their contests; but it would require the aggregate of\r\na large number of predatory incursions and isolated burnings to balance\r\nthe awful scene of conflagration and blood which at once extinguished\r\nthe power of Sassacus, and the brave and indomitable Narragansets over\r\nwhom he reigned. No! until it is forgotten that by some Christians in\r\ninfant Massachusetts it was held to be right to kill Indians, as the\r\nagents and familiars of Azazel; until the early records of even tolerant\r\nConnecticut, which disclose the fact that the Indians were seized by the\r\nPuritans, transported to the British West Indies, and sold as slaves,\r\nare lost; until the Amazon and La Plata shall have washed away the\r\nbloody history of the Spanish American conquest; and until the fact that\r\nCortez stretched the unhappy Guatimozin naked upon a bed of burning\r\ncoals (or General Sullivan's devastation of the Six Indian Nations) is\r\nproved to be a fiction, let not the American Indians be pronounced the\r\nmost cruel of men.\"[101]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap.\r\nxix., p. 325.\r\n\r\n\"About four weeks after Colonel Zebulon Butler's return, some hundreds\r\nof Indians, a large body of Tories, and about fifty regulars, entered\r\nCherry Valley, within the State of New York.

Horses and stock of every kind were killed. The arms and\r\nammunition of the Indians were either destroyed or brought off, and\r\ntheir settlements were laid waste.

In April, Colonel\r\nVan Shaick, with fifty-five men, marched from Fort Schuyler, and burnt\r\nthe whole Onondago settlements, consisting of about fifty houses, with a\r\nlarge quantity of provisions, killed twelve Indians and made thirty-four\r\nprisoners, without the loss of a single man.

This he accomplished in fourteen days, at\r\nthe head of 394 horsemen. In that short space he burned thirteen towns\r\nand villages, killed upwards of forty Indians, and took a number of\r\nprisoners. Not one of his party was killed, and only two were wounded.\r\nThe Americans did not expend over two pounds of ammunition, and yet only\r\nthree Indians escaped after having been once seen. * *\r\n\r\n\"Towards the end of the war, in 1782, there was a barbarous and\r\nunprovoked massacre of some civilized Indians who had settled near the\r\nMuskingum. These, under the influence of some pious missionaries of the\r\nMoravian persuasion, had been formed into some degree of religious\r\norder. They abhorred war, and would take no part therein, giving for a\r\nreason that 'the Great Spirit did not make men to destroy men, but to\r\nlove and assist each other.' From love of peace they advised those of\r\ntheir own colour, who were bent on war, to desist from it. They were\r\nalso led from humanity to inform the white people of their danger, when\r\nthey knew their settlements were about to be invaded. This provoked the\r\nhostile (American) Indians to such a degree, that they carried these\r\nquite away from Muskingum to a bank of the Sandusky Creek. They, finding\r\ncorn dear and scarce in their new habitations, obtained liberty to come\r\nback in the fall of the same year to Muskingum, that they might collect\r\nthe crops they had planted before their removal.\r\n\r\n\"While the white (American) people at and near the Monongahela heard\r\nthat a number of Indians were at the Moravian towns on the Muskingum,\r\nthey gave out that their intentions were hostile. Without any further\r\nenquiry, 160 of them crossed the Ohio, and put to death these harmless,\r\ninoffensive people, though they made no resistance. In conformity to\r\ntheir religious principles, these Moravians submitted to their hard\r\nfate, without attempting to destroy their murderers. Upwards of ninety\r\nof this pacific race were killed by men who, while they called\r\nthemselves Christians, were more deserving of the name of savages than\r\nthose whom they inhumanly murdered.\" (Dr. Ramsay's History of the United\r\nStates, Vol. II., Chap. xix., pp. 330-332.)\r\n\r\nMr. Hildreth gives the following account of the proceedings of the\r\neighty or ninety men who murdered the peaceful Indians: \"Arrived at the\r\nmiddle Moravian village, they found a party of Christian Indians\r\ngathering corn. The Indians at another neighbouring village were sent\r\nfor, and the whole were placed together in two houses. A council was\r\nthen held to decide upon their fate. Williamson, their Commander,\r\nheretofore accused of too great lenity to the Indians, referred the\r\nmatter to his men. Only sixteen voted for mercy; all the rest,\r\nprofessing a faith common on the frontier, that 'an Indian has no more\r\nsoul than a buffalo,' were for murder. They rushed on their prey,\r\nscalping-knife in hand, and upwards of ninety Indians, men, women, and\r\nchildren, soon lay bleeding and gasping.\" (History of the United States,\r\nVol. III., Chap. lxv., p. 423.)\r\n\r\n\"Soon after this unprovoked massacre, a party of Americans set out for\r\nSandusky, to destroy the Indian towns in that part; but the Delawares,\r\nWyandots, and other Indians opposed them. An engagement ensued, in which\r\nsome of the white people were killed, and several were taken prisoners.\r\nAmong the latter were Colonel Crawford and his son-in-law. The colonel\r\nwas sacrificed to the manes of those Indians who were massacred in the\r\nMoravian towns. The other prisoners were put to death with the tomahawk.\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the American war, the desolation brought by the Indians on\r\nthe frontier settlements of the United States, and on the Indians by the\r\nAmericans, was sufficient to excite compassion in the most obdurate\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Not only men and warriors, but women and children indiscriminately\r\nmurdered, while whole settlements were involved in promiscuous\r\ndesolation. Each was made a scourge to the other; and the unavoidable\r\ncalamities of war were rendered doubly distressing by the dispersion of\r\nfamilies, the breaking up of settlements, and an addition of savage\r\ncruelties, to the most extensive devastation of those things which\r\nconduce to the comfort of human life.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: The biographer of Brant and historian of the Border Wars\r\nof the American Revolution thinks that Sir Guy Carleton was not opposed\r\nto the employment of the Indians in the war with the Congress (Vol. I.,\r\npp. 89, 90), and quotes Brant as his authority; but General Haldimand\r\n(who himself favoured the employment of the Indians in the war) appears\r\nto be the safest interpreter of the views of Sir Guy Carleton, who\r\nintended, by the friendly alliance of the Indians with the King, that\r\nthey should be neutral.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Stone's Life of Joseph Brant, including the Border Wars of\r\nthe American Revolution, Vol. II., Chap. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Life of Brant, including the Border Wars of the American\r\nRevolution.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Brant himself was educated at Philadelphia, married and\r\nlived quietly on his land in the Mohawk Valley, entertained the\r\nmissionaries, and assisted in translating portions of the New Testament;\r\nbut when the revolution commenced he was not allowed to live in peace\r\nunless he joined the revolutionary party. He determined to maintain, as\r\nhe said, the covenant faith of his forefathers to the King of England,\r\nand entered upon the \"warpath,\" in which he became so distinguished a\r\nhero; in the course of which he perpetrated many deeds of cruelty, but\r\nalso, as his biographer records, performed many acts of humanity,\r\nkindness, and generosity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Stone's Brant and the Border Wars of the American\r\nRevolution, Vol. I., Introduction, pp. 13, 14, 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nSITUATION AND TREATMENT OF THE LOYALISTS DURING THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the United Empire Loyalists for several months before,\r\nas well as after, the Declaration of Independence, was humiliating to\r\nfreemen and perilous in the extreme; and that condition became still\r\nmore pitiable after the alliance of the revolutionists with the\r\nFrench--the hereditary enemies of both England and the colonies. From\r\nthe beginning the Loyalists were deprived of the freedom of the press,\r\nfreedom of assemblage, and under an espionage universal, sleepless,\r\nmalignant--subjecting the Loyalists to every species of insult, to\r\narrest and imprisonment at any moment, and to the seizure and\r\nconfiscation of their property.\r\n\r\nBefore the Declaration of Independence, both parties were confessedly\r\nBritish subjects, professing allegiance to the same sovereign and\r\nconstitution of government, both professing and avowing their adherence\r\nto the rights of British subjects; but differing from each other as to\r\nthe extent of those rights in contradistinction to the constitutional\r\nrights of the Crown and those of the people--as in the case of party\r\ndiscussions of all constitutional questions, whether in the colonies or\r\nmother country for centuries past. Both parties had their advocates in\r\nthe British Parliament; and while the prerogative advocates supported\r\nthe corrupt Ministry of the day--or the King's party, as it was\r\ncalled--the Opposition in Parliament supported the petitions and\r\nremonstrances of those colonists who claimed a more popular colonial\r\ngovernment; but all the advocates of the constitutional rights of the\r\ncolonists, in both Houses of Parliament, disclaimed, on the part of\r\nthose whom they represented, the least idea of independence or\r\nseparation from England. The Declaration of Independence essentially\r\nchanged the relations of parties, both in Great Britain and America. The\r\nparty of independence--getting, after months of manipulation by its\r\nleaders, first a majority of one in the Congress, and afterwards\r\nincreasing that majority by various means--repudiated their former\r\nprofessed principles of connection with England; broke faith with the\r\ngreat men and parties in England, both in and out of Parliament, who had\r\nvindicated their rights and professions for more than ten years; broke\r\nfaith also with their numerous fellow-subjects in America who adhered to\r\nthe old faith, to the old flag, and connection with England, and who\r\nwere declared by resolutions of Conventions, from Congress, provinces,\r\ncounties, to townships and towns, enemies of their country, rebels and\r\ntraitors, and treated as such.[102] Even before the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, some of these popular meetings, called Conventions,\r\nassumed the highest functions of legislation and government, and dealt\r\nat pleasure with the rights, liberties, property, and even lives of\r\ntheir Tory fellow citizens. There had been violent words, terms of\r\nmutual reproach, as in all cases of hot political contests; but it was\r\nfor the advocates of independent liberty to deny to the adherents of the\r\nold faith all liberty of speech or of opinion, except under penalties of\r\nimprisonment or banishment, with confiscation of property. For a large\r\nportion of the community[103] to be thus stript of their civil rights by\r\nresolutions of a Convention, and reduced to the position of proscribed\r\naliens or slaves, must have been galling to Loyalists beyond\r\nexpression, and well calculated to prompt them to outbreaks of passion,\r\nand retaliations of resentment and revenge, each such act followed by a\r\ncorresponding act from the opposite party.[104]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that forbearance and respect would have been shown\r\nto those who remained \"steadfast and immovable\" in the traditional faith\r\nof British monarchy and British connection, notwithstanding a corrupt\r\nand arbitrary party was in power for the time being; but the very\r\nreverse of this was the case on the part of those who professed, as one\r\ncardinal article of their political creed, that \"all men are born free\r\nand equal,\" and therefore that every man had an equal right to his\r\nopinions, and an equal right to the expression of them; but all this was\r\nreversed in the treatment of the Loyalists. Mr. Hildreth well describes\r\nthe position and treatment of the Loyalists, both before and after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"In the position of that considerable class of persons who had remained\r\nin doubt, the Declaration of Independence and the assumption of State\r\ngovernment made a decided change. It was now necessary to choose one\r\nside or the other.\r\n\r\n\"Very serious, too, was the change in the legal position of the class\r\nknown as Tories, in many of the States a large minority, and in all\r\nrespectable for wealth and social position. Of those thus stigmatized,\r\nsome were inclined to favour the utmost claims of the mother country;\r\n_but the greater part, though determined to adhere to the British\r\nconnection, yet deprecated the policy which had brought on so fatal a\r\nquarrel_. This loyal minority, especially its more conspicuous members,\r\nas the warmth of political feeling increased, had been exposed to the\r\nviolence of mobs, and to all sorts of personal indignities, in which\r\nprivate malice or a wanton and insolent spirit of mischief had been too\r\noften gratified under the disguise of patriotism. The barbarous and\r\ndisgraceful practice of tarring and feathering and carting Tories,\r\nplacing them in a cart and carrying them about as a sort of spectacle,\r\nhad become in some places a favourite amusement. To restrain these\r\noutrages, Congress had specially committed the oversight of Tories and\r\nsuspected persons to the regularly appointed Committees of Inspection\r\nand Observation for the several counties and districts. But even these\r\nCommittees were not always very judicious or discriminating in the\r\nexercise of despotic powers implied in that delicate trust.\r\n\r\n\"By the recent political changes, Tories and suspected persons became\r\nexposed to dangers from the law as well as from mobs. Having boldly\r\nseized the reins of government, the new State authorities claimed the\r\nallegiance of all residents within their limits, and under the lead and\r\nrecommendation of Congress, those who refused to acknowledge their\r\nauthority, or who adhered to their enemies, were exposed to severe\r\npenalties, confiscation of property, imprisonment, banishment, and\r\nfinally death.\"[105]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that these lawless outrages upon \"Tories\" were ever\r\nchecked or discountenanced, or their authors ever even reproved by the\r\nso-called authorities, but were actively or tacitly encouraged; so that\r\nbefore and during the very first months of Independence, the Loyalists\r\nwere subject to the penalties of the mobs on one side and to the more\r\ncruel penalties of new-made law by a newly self-created authority on the\r\nother side. Perhaps no one did as much to promote this cruel policy\r\nagainst the Loyalists as Mr. John Adams, who was the ruling spirit in\r\nall the proceedings of Boston for years, the advocate of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, and the chief member of the Secret Committee of\r\nCongress for years, and was at length appointed Ambassador from the\r\nAmerican Congress to Holland, whence he wrote a letter to Thomas\r\nCushing, then Lieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts, but which was\r\nintercepted on board of the prize brigantine _Cabot_, and carried to St.\r\nChristopher's, in the West Indies. This letter was published in the\r\nAnnual Register for 1781, pp. 259-261. It is dated \"Amsterdam, December\r\n15th, 1780,\" more than four years after the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand fully indicates the source of all those cruel acts against the\r\nLoyalists at the commencement and during the early years of the American\r\ncivil war. Mr. Adams says:\r\n\r\n\"It is true, I believe, what you suggest, that Lord North showed a\r\ndisposition to give up the contest, but was diverted from it not\r\nunlikely by the representation of the Americans in London, who, in\r\nconnection with their coadjutors in America, have been thorns to us\r\nindeed on both sides of the water; but I think their career might have\r\nbeen stopt on your side if the executive officers had not been too timid\r\nin a point which I so strenuously recommended at the first--namely, to\r\nfine, imprison, and hang all inimical to the cause, without favour or\r\naffection. I foresaw the evil that would arise from that quarter, and\r\nwished to have timely stopt it. I would have hanged my own brother had\r\nhe taken a part with our enemy in the contest.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the \"strenuously recommended\" wholesale hanging policy of Mr.\r\nJohn Adams for the extermination of the \"Tories\"--a curious illustration\r\nof his professed doctrine, that \"all men are born free and equal,\" and\r\nwhich largely accounts for the treatment of Loyalists during the war,\r\nand for the exasperated feelings which existed between them and their\r\npersecutors and oppressors of the Independence party. One of the first\r\nmanifestations of this relentless feeling against the Loyalists occurred\r\nin Mr. Adams' native city of Boston, on its evacuation by General Howe,\r\nwho, as Lord Mahon says, \"had taken with him, at their own urgent\r\nrequest, above a thousand of the inhabitants of Boston, who had espoused\r\nthe cause of the parent State, and who dreaded on that account the\r\nvengeance of their countrymen. Before they had embarked, they had, as\r\nWashington informs his brother, publicly declared that 'if they thought\r\nthe most abject submission would procure them peace, they never would\r\nhave stirred.'\"[106] (Letter to John Augustine Washington, March 13th,\r\n1776, as printed in the American Archives.)\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, throughout this contest, and amidst all those qualities\r\ndisplayed by the Americans, many of those qualities being entitled to\r\nhigh respect and commendation, there was none certainly less amiable\r\nthan their merciless rancour against those among them who adhered to the\r\nroyal side. In reference to those, a ferocious saying came to be current\r\nin America, that though we are commanded to forgive our enemies, we are\r\nnowhere commanded to forgive our friends. In reference to them, true\r\nJetburgh justice was more than once administered--first the punishment,\r\nthen the accusation, and last of all the evidence.\"[107]\r\n\r\nThe Convention of the State of New York (1776) resolved that \"any person\r\nbeing an adherent to the King of Great Britain should be guilty of\r\ntreason and suffer death.\"[108]\r\n\r\nThe Loyalists experienced similar treatment in other provinces.\r\n\r\n\"Previous to their evacuation of Philadelphia, the Congress had ordered\r\nsome of the principal Quakers and other gentlemen of the first\r\nconsideration in that place, above twenty in number, to be taken into\r\ncustody, as strongly attached to the royal cause, and known enemies to\r\nthe ruling powers. These gentlemen had repeatedly refused to give any\r\nwritten or verbal acknowledgment of allegiance or submission to the\r\nAmerican Government, or promise of holding no correspondence with its\r\nenemies. Notwithstanding the evident danger their persons were in, they\r\nhad even the resolution to refuse confining themselves to their\r\nrespective dwellings. The spirit of these gentlemen was unconquerable to\r\nthe last, as they still persisted, in defiance of threats, and in spite\r\nof all solicitations and entreaty, immovable in their principles and in\r\ntheir determination to reject the test that was proposed to them. They\r\nwere sent prisoners to Stanton, in Virginia, as soon as it was\r\napprehended that the British troops would take possession of\r\nPhiladelphia.\"[109]\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Lord Cornwallis, at Yorktown, the defenceless\r\nLoyalists were the objects of vengeance as they went further north. The\r\narmy of Lord Cornwallis received civil treatment from Washington's\r\narmy,[110] and great kindness from the French officers and soldiers.\r\nLord Mahon observes:\r\n\r\n\"The followers of the English army, left defenceless at Yorktown, were\r\nexposed to much ill-treatment on the part of the native soldiers,\r\nthirsting, it was said, for vengeance. Abbé Robin[111] saw an English\r\nlady, a colonel's wife, come in tears to implore for herself and for her\r\nchildren the protection of French generosity against American outrage.\r\nOn the other hand, we find the English officers and soldiers, the actual\r\nprisoners of war, bear willing testimony to the kindness they received.\r\nThus speaks Lord Cornwallis in his letter to Sir Henry Clinton: 'The\r\ntreatment in general that we have received from the enemy since our\r\nsurrender has been perfectly good and proper. But the kindness and\r\nattention that has been shown us by the French officers in particular,\r\ntheir delicate sensibility of our situation, their generous and pressing\r\noffer of money, both public and private, to any amount, has really gone\r\nbeyond what I can possibly describe, and will, I hope, make an\r\nimpression on the breast of every English officer, whenever the fortune\r\nof war should put any of them into our power.'\" (Lord Mahon's History of\r\nEngland, etc., Vol. VII., Chap. lxiv., pp. 181, 182.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ACTS OF LEGISLATIVE BODIES FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF THE ADHERENTS TO\r\nTHE CROWN WERE NUMEROUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In _Rhode Island_, death and _confiscation_ of estate were the\r\npenalties by law for any person who communicated with _the Ministry_ or\r\ntheir agents, _or_ who afforded supplies to the forces, _or_ piloted the\r\narmed ships of the King. Besides these general statutes, several Acts\r\nwere passed in that State to confiscate and sequester the property of\r\ncertain persons who were designated by name.\r\n\r\n\"In _Connecticut_, the offences of supplying the royal army or navy, of\r\ngiving them information, of enlisting or procuring others to enlist in\r\nthem, and of piloting or assisting naval vessels, were punished more\r\nmildly, and involved only the loss of estate and personal liberty for a\r\nterm not exceeding three years. To _speak_ or _write_ or act against the\r\ndoings of Congress or of the Assembly of Connecticut, was punishable by\r\n_disqualification for office, imprisonment_, and the disarming of the\r\noffender. Here, too, was a law for seizing and confiscating the estates\r\nof those who sought royal protection, and absented themselves from their\r\nhomes or the country.\r\n\r\n\"In _Massachusetts_, a person _suspected_ of enmity to the Whig cause\r\ncould be _arrested_ under a magistrate's warrant and banished, unless he\r\nwould swear fealty to the friends of liberty; and the select men of\r\ntowns could prefer charges of political treachery in town meetings, and\r\nthe individual accused, if convicted by a jury, could be sent into the\r\nenemy's jurisdiction (banished). Massachusetts also designated by name,\r\nand generally by occupation and residence, 380 of her people, of whom\r\nseventeen had been inhabitants of Maine, who had fled from their homes,\r\nand denounced against any one of them who should return, apprehension,\r\nimprisonment, and transportation to a place possessed by the British;\r\nand for a second voluntary return, without leave, _death_ without the\r\nbenefit of clergy. By another law, the property of twenty-nine persons\r\nwho were denominated 'notorious conspirators,' was confiscated--two had\r\nbeen governors, one lieutenant-governor, one treasurer, one\r\nattorney-general, one chief justice, and four commissioners of customs.\r\n\r\n\"_New Hampshire_ passed Acts similar to these, under which seventy-six\r\nof her former citizens were prohibited from coming within her borders,\r\nand the estates of twenty-eight were declared to be forfeited.\r\n\r\n\"_Virginia_ passed a resolution to the effect that persons of a given\r\ndescription should be deemed and treated as aliens, and that their\r\nproperty should be sold, and the proceeds go into the public treasury\r\nfor future disposal; and also a law prohibiting the migration of certain\r\npersons to that commonwealth, and providing penalties for the violation\r\nof its provisions.\r\n\r\n\"In _New York_, the County Committees were authorized to apprehend and\r\ndecide upon the guilt of such inhabitants as were _supposed_ to hold\r\ncorrespondence with the enemy, or had committed some other specified\r\nact; and they might punish those whom they adjudged to be guilty with\r\nimprisonment for three months, or banishment. There, too, persons\r\nopposed to liberty and independence were prohibited from practising law\r\nin the Courts; and the effects of fifty-nine persons, of whom three were\r\nwomen, and their rights of remainder and reversion, were to pass by\r\nconfiscation from them to the people. So, also, a parent whose sons went\r\noff and adhered to the enemy was subjected to a tax of ninepence on the\r\npound of the parents' estate for each and every such son; and until a\r\nrevision of the law, Whigs were as liable to this tax as others.\r\n\r\n\"In _New Jersey_, one Act was passed to punish traitors and disaffected\r\npersons; another, for taking charge of and leasing the real estates, and\r\nfor forfeiting the personal estates of certain fugitives and offenders;\r\nand a third for forfeiting to, and vesting in the State, the real\r\nproperty of the persons designated in the second statute; and a fourth,\r\nsupplemental to the Act first mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"In _Pennsylvania_, sixty-two persons, who were designated by name, were\r\nrequired by the Executive Council to surrender themselves to some Judge\r\nof a Court, or Justice of the Peace, within a specified time, and abide\r\ntrial for _treason_, or in default of appearance to stand attainted; and\r\nby an Act of a subsequent time, the estates of thirty-six other persons,\r\nwho were also designated by name, and who had been previously attainted\r\nof treason, were declared to be confiscated.\r\n\r\n\"The Act of _Delaware_ provided that the property, both real and\r\npersonal, of certain persons who were named, and who were forty-six in\r\nnumber, should be forfeited to the State, 'subject, nevertheless, to the\r\npayment of the said offenders' just debts,' unless, as in Pennsylvania,\r\nthey gave themselves up to trial for _the crime of treason in adhering\r\nto the royal cause_.\r\n\r\n\"_Maryland_ seized, confiscated, and appropriated all property of\r\npersons in allegiance to the British Crown, and appointed Commissioners\r\nto carry out the terms of three statutes which were passed to effect\r\nthese purposes.\r\n\r\n\"In _North Carolina_, the Confiscation Act embraced sixty-five specified\r\nindividuals, and four mercantile firms, and by its terms not only\r\nincluded the 'lands' of these persons and commercial houses, but their\r\n'negroes and other personal property.'\r\n\r\n\"The law of _Georgia_, which was enacted very near the close of the\r\nstruggle, declared certain persons to have been guilty of treason\r\nagainst that State, and their estates to be forfeited for their\r\noffences.\"[112]\r\n\r\n\"_South Carolina_ surpassed all the other members of the confederacy,\r\nMassachusetts excepted. The Loyalists of the State, whose rights,\r\npersons, and property were affected by legislation, were divided into\r\nfour classes. The persons who had offended the least, who were\r\nforty-five in number, were allowed to retain their estates, but were\r\namerced twelve per cent. of their value. Soon after the fall of\r\nCharleston, and when disaffection to the Whig cause was so general, 210\r\npersons, who styled themselves to be 'principal inhabitants' of the\r\ncity, signed an address to Sir Henry Clinton, in which they state that\r\nthey have every inducement to return to their allegiance, and ardently\r\nhope to be re-admitted to the character and condition of British\r\nsubjects. These 'addressers' formed another class. Of these 210,\r\nsixty-three were banished and lost their property by forfeiture, either\r\nfor this offence or the graver one of affixing their names to a petition\r\nto the royal general, to be armed on the royal side. Another class,\r\ncomposed of the still larger number of eighty persons, were _also\r\nbanished and divested of their estates_, for the crime of holding civil\r\nor military commissions under the Crown, after the conquest of South\r\nCarolina. And the same penalties were inflicted upon thirteen others,\r\nwho, on the success of Lord Cornwallis at Camden, presented his lordship\r\nwith congratulations. Still fourteen others were _banished and deprived\r\nof their estates_ because they were _obnoxious_. Thus, then, the\r\n'addressers,' 'petitioners,' 'congratulators,' and 'obnoxious\r\nLoyalists,' who were proscribed, and who suffered the loss of their\r\nproperty (in South Carolina), were 170 in number; and if to these we add\r\nthe forty-five who were fined twelve pounds in the hundred of the value\r\nof their estates, the aggregate will be 215.\r\n\r\n\"Much of the legislation of the several States appears to have\r\nproceeded from the recommendations made from time to time _by Congress_,\r\nand that body passed several acts and resolutions of its own. Thus they\r\nsubjected to _martial law_ and to _death_ all who should furnish\r\nprovisions and certain other articles to the King's troops in New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware; and they resolved that all Loyalists\r\ntaken in arms should be sent to the States to which they belonged, there\r\nto be _dealt with as traitors_\" (not as prisoners of war, as were\r\nAmericans taken in arms against the British).[113]\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE CONFISCATION ACTS ABOVE CITED.\r\n\r\nThe Draconian Code or the Spanish Inquisition can hardly be said to\r\nexceed in severity and intolerance, the acts of the several State\r\nLegislatures and Committees above quoted, in which mere opinions are\r\ndeclared to be treason, as also the refusal to renounce a solemn oath of\r\nallegiance. The very place of residence, the non-presenting one's self\r\nto be tried as a traitor, the mere _suspicion_ of holding Loyalist\r\nopinions, involved the loss of liberty and property. Scores of persons\r\nwere made criminals, not after trial by a verdict of a regularly\r\nempanelled jury, but by name, in acts or resolutions of Legislatures,\r\nand sometimes of Committees. No modern civilized country has presented\r\nsuch a spectacle of the wholesale disposal, by name, of the rights,\r\nliberties and properties, and even lives of citizens, by inquisition and\r\nvarious bodies, as was here presented against the Loyalists, guilty of\r\nno crime against their neighbours except holding to the opinions of\r\ntheir forefathers, and the former opinions of their present persecutors,\r\nwho had usurped the power to rob, banish, and destroy them--who embodied\r\nin themselves, at one and the same time, the functions of law makers,\r\nlaw judges, and law executioners, and the receivers and disposers, or,\r\nas was the case, the possessors of the property which they confiscated\r\nagainst the Loyalists.\r\n\r\nIs it surprising, then, that under such a system of oppression and\r\nrobbery, Loyalists should be prompted to deeds of heroism, and sometimes\r\nof desperation and cruelty, to avenge themselves for the wrongs\r\ninflicted upon them, and to recover the liberties and properties of\r\nwhich they had thus been deprived, rendering themselves and their\r\nfamilies homeless, and reducing them to poverty and distress? No one can\r\njustify many deeds of the Loyalists; but who could be surprised had they\r\nbeen more desperate than they were? And this the more so as they were,\r\nprobably, superior in wealth and nearly equal in numbers to their\r\noppressors, who had suddenly seized upon all military sources of power,\r\ndisarmed the Loyalists, and erected tribunals for their ruin.[114]\r\nAmerican writers often speak of the havoc committed by the \"Tories,\" but\r\nthe acts of Legislatures and Committees above quoted furnish ample\r\ncauses and provocation for retaliation, and the most desperate\r\nenterprises and efforts to recover lawful rights and hard-earned\r\nproperty. Where these Confiscating Acts had been most sweeping and\r\nsevere, as in the case of South Carolina, and the two parties nearly\r\nequal, this internecine war against life and property was the most\r\nrelentless.[115]\r\n\r\nIt is as easy as it is unfair for American writers to narrate and\r\nmagnify the murderous acts of the \"Tories,\" and omit those perpetrated\r\nby the \"Whigs,\" as well as the cruel laws against the liberties,\r\nproperty, and lives of the \"Tories,\" which gave rise to these barbarous\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: \"Committees exercised legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial powers. It is not to be doubted that, in many instances, these\r\nwere improperly used, and that private resentments were often covered\r\nunder the specious veil of patriotism. The sufferers, in passing over to\r\nthe Royalists, carried with them a keen remembrance of the vengeance of\r\nCommittees, and when opportunity presented were tempted to retaliate.\"\r\n(Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II., Chap. xxvi., pp.\r\n467, 468.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: \"Until the Declaration of Independence they were by far\r\nthe largest party, who not only expected but prayed for a\r\nreconciliation.

The ligaments that connect nations are never less\r\npowerful, though less tender, than those which unite individuals,\r\nfamilies, and clans. Consanguinity, affinity, alliance, operate alike on\r\neach.\" (Allen's History of the American War.)\r\n\r\n\"The disaffected, or rather the Loyalists, were a formidable party in\r\nthe Middle States. They might be forgiven--many of them acted from\r\nprinciple, from a conscientious regard to their duty, from affection to\r\ntheir 'Sovereign,' and however mistaken they may have been, they deserve\r\nno censure.

Small parties,\r\neverywhere under arms, some on one side, some on the other, with very\r\nlittle reference to greater operations, were desperately bent on plunder\r\nand blood.\" (Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. III., Chap.\r\nxli., p. 329.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Hildreth's History of the United States, Vol. III., Chap,\r\nxxxiii., pp. 137, 138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Having thus recovered their capital (Boston), one of the\r\nfirst acts of government exercised by the Provincial Assembly was to\r\norder the effects and the estates of those who fled with the British\r\ntroops to Halifax to be publicly disposed of, and their produce applied\r\nto the use of the State. Such adherents to Britain as had risked to\r\nremain behind, were treated with great severity. They were prosecuted as\r\nenemies and betrayers of their country, and their estates were\r\nconfiscated accordingly.

It was stipulated that, immediately after the\r\ncapitulation, the _Bonetta_ sloop-of-war was to sail for New York,\r\nunsearched, with despatches from Lord Cornwallis to Sir Henry Clinton,\r\nand with as many soldiers on board as he should think fit to send;\r\nprovided only that the vessel was returned, and that the soldiers were\r\naccounted for as prisoners in a future exchange.

Just at the juncture of Colonel\r\nCampbell's conquest of Georgia, the Legislature of that State was\r\npassing a Confiscation Act against \"Tories\" and preparing to carry it\r\ninto effect. During the latter part of the nearly four years of British\r\noccupation, the Congress party elected a Governor and organized their\r\nLegislature, meeting at Augusta. Two months before the evacuation of\r\nSavannah by the British, the Legislature of the Congress party passed\r\nthe Confiscation Act referred to in the text. We find a copy of this act\r\nin a pamphlet published in London in 1783, entitled _The Particular Case\r\nof the Georgia Loyalists_. This Act may serve as a specimen of\r\nConfiscation Acts passed in other States. We give it entire, remarking\r\nthat it curiously assumes in the preamble that there had been no break\r\nin the Government of the State from 1778 to 1782, though the English had\r\nruled the State during the whole of that period. The Act is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas on the 1st day of March, which was in the year of our Lord\r\n1778, an Act was passed for attainting certain persons therein mentioned\r\nof treason, and confiscating their estates for the use and benefit of\r\nthis State, which said Act has not yet been carried into full execution:\r\nAnd whereas it is necessary that the names of the said persons so\r\nattainted by the same law should be inserted in a law, with the names of\r\nvarious other persons who have since the aforesaid time been guilty of\r\ntreason against this State, and the authority of the same, by\r\ntraitorously adhering to the King of Great Britain, and by aiding,\r\nassisting, abetting, and comforting the generals and other officers,\r\ncivil and military, of the said King, to enforce his authority in and\r\nover this State, and the good people of the same: And whereas the\r\n_aforesaid treason_, and other atrocious crimes, justly merit forfeiture\r\nof protection and property:\r\n\r\n\"Be it enacted, by the representatives and freemen of the State of\r\nGeorgia in General Assembly met, and by the authority of the same, that\r\nall and each of the following persons, viz.

That the adherents of the Crown were mistaken, is certain.\r\nBut yet in the Carolinas, and Georgia, and possibly in Pennsylvania the\r\ntwo parties differed but little in point of strength, while in New York\r\nthe Whigs were far weaker than their opponents.\" (Historical\r\nIntroduction to Col.

During the last\r\nthree years of the war, the principal operations of the British army\r\nwere directed to the Southern States; and there the exasperations of\r\nparty feeling may be supposed to have been the strongest.[116]\r\n\r\nNo where had arbitrary authority been exercised more unmercifully\r\ntowards the revolutionists than by Earl Cornwallis and Lord Rawdon in\r\nSouth and North Carolina. Dr. Ramsay says: \"The troops under the command\r\nof Cornwallis had spread waste and ruin over the face of all the\r\ncountry, for 400 miles on the sea coast, and for 200 miles westward.\r\nTheir marches from Charleston to Camden, from Camden to the River Dan,\r\nfrom the Dan through North Carolina to Wilmington, from Wilmington to\r\nPetersburg, and from Petersburg through many parts of Virginia, till\r\nthey finally settled in Yorktown, made a route of more than 1,100 miles.\r\nEvery place through which they passed in these various marches\r\nexperienced the effects of their rapacity. Their numbers enabled them to\r\ngo where they pleased; their rage for plunder disposed them to take\r\nwhatever they had the means of removing; and their animosity to the\r\nAmericans led them often to the wanton destruction of what they could\r\nneither use nor carry off. By their means, thousands had been involved\r\nin distress.\"[117]\r\n\r\nIt was therefore in South Carolina, more than any other State, that\r\nanimosity might be expected to be intense and prolonged against the\r\nLoyalists; but among these men of the South, with their love of freedom,\r\nand dash and energy in war, there was a potent element of chivalry and\r\nBritish generosity which favourably contrasts with the Massachusetts\r\nschool of persecuting bigotry and of hatred, from generation to\r\ngeneration, to England and English institutions. Accordingly we learn\r\nfrom Moultrie's Memoirs, Vol. II., p. 326, that \"after the peace, a\r\nJoint Committee from the Senate and House of Representatives in South\r\nCarolina, chosen to hear the petitions of Loyalists who had incurred the\r\npenalties of the confiscation, banishment, and amercement laws, made a\r\nreport to the separate Houses in favour of the great majority of the\r\npetitioners; and a great part of those names which were upon the\r\nconfiscation, banishment and amercement lists were struck off.\"\r\n\r\n\"The petitions of others were afterwards presented from year to year,\r\nand ultimately almost the whole of them had their estates restored to\r\nthem, and they were received as citizens.\"[118]\r\n\r\nAs to the proceedings of the other States, after the close of the war,\r\nin regard to the United Empire Loyalists, the following summary, from\r\nthe _Historical Introduction_ to Colonel Sabine's _Biography of the\r\nAmerican Loyalists_, will be sufficient:\r\n\r\n\"At the peace, justice and good policy both required a general amnesty,\r\nand the revocation of the acts of disability and banishment, so that\r\nonly those who had been guilty of flagrant crimes should be excluded\r\nfrom becoming citizens. Instead of this, however, the State Legislatures\r\ngenerally continued in a course of hostile action, and treated the\r\nconscientious and pure, and the unprincipled and corrupt, with the same\r\nindiscrimination as they had done during the struggle. In some parts of\r\nthe country there really appears to have been a determination to place\r\nthese misguided but then humbled men beyond the pale of human sympathy.\r\nIn one legislative body, a petition from the banished, praying to be\r\nallowed to return to their homes, was rejected without a division; and a\r\nlaw was passed which denied to such as had remained within the State,\r\nand to all others who had opposed the revolution, the privilege of\r\nvoting at the elections or of holding office. In another State, all who\r\nhad sought royal protection were declared to be aliens, and to be\r\nincapable of claiming and holding property within it, and their return\r\nwas forbidden. Other Legislatures refused to repeal such of their laws\r\nas conflicted with the conditions of the treaty of peace, and carried\r\nout the doctrines of the States alluded to above without material\r\nmodification. But the temper of South Carolina was far more moderate.\r\nActing on the wise principle that 'when the offenders are numerous, it\r\nis sometimes prudent to overlook their crimes,' she listened to the\r\nsupplications made to her by the fallen, and restored to their civil and\r\npolitical rights a large portion of those who had suffered under her\r\nbanishment and confiscation laws. The course pursued by New York,\r\nMassachusetts, and Virginia was different. These States were neither\r\nmerciful nor just; and it is even true that Whigs, whose gallantry in\r\nthe field, whose prudence in the Cabinet, and whose exertions in\r\ndiplomatic stations abroad, had contributed essentially to the success\r\nof the conflict, were regarded with enmity on account of their attempts\r\nto produce a better state of feeling and more humane legislation. Had\r\nthese States adopted a different line of conduct, their good example\r\nwould not have been lost, probably, upon others, smaller and of less\r\ninfluence; and had Virginia especially been honest enough to have\r\npermitted the payment of debts which her people owed to British subjects\r\nbefore the war, the first years of our freedom would not have been\r\nstained with a breach of our public faith, and the long and angry\r\ncontroversy with Great Britain, which well-nigh involved us in a second\r\nwar with her, might not have occurred.\r\n\r\n\"Eventually, popular indignation diminished; the statute book was\r\ndivested of its most objectionable enactments, and numbers were\r\npermitted to occupy their old homes, and to recover the whole or part of\r\ntheir property; but by far the greater part of the Loyalists who quitted\r\nthe country at the commencement of, or during the war, never returned;\r\nand of the many thousands who abandoned the United States after the\r\npeace, and while these enactments were in force, few, comparatively, had\r\nthe desire or even the means to revisit the land from which they were\r\nexpelled. Such persons and their descendants form a very considerable\r\nproportion of the population of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Upper\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\"It is equally to be regretted on grounds of policy that the\r\n_majorities_[119] in the State Legislatures did not remember, with Mr.\r\nJefferson, that separation from England 'was contemplated with\r\naffliction by all,' and that, like Mr. Adams, many sound Whigs 'would\r\nhave given everything they possessed for a restoration to the state of\r\nthings before the contest began, provided they could have had sufficient\r\nsecurity for its continuance.' Then they might have done at an early\r\nmoment after the cessation of hostilities, what they actually did do in\r\na few years afterwards--namely, have allowed the banished Loyalists to\r\nreturn from exile, and, excluding those against whom enormities could\r\nhave been proved, have conferred upon them, and upon those who had\r\nremained to be driven away at the peace, the rights of citizens. Most of\r\nthem would have easily fallen into respect for the new state of things,\r\nold friendships and intimacies would have been revived, and long before\r\nthis time all would have mingled in one mass. * *\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of _expediency_, how unwise was it to perpetuate the\r\nfeelings of the opponents of the revolution, and to keep them a distinct\r\nclass for a time, and for harm yet unknown! How ill-judged the measures\r\nthat caused them to settle the hitherto neglected possessions of the\r\nBritish Crown! Nova Scotia had been won and lost, and lost and won, in\r\nthe struggle between France and England, and the blood of New England\r\nhad been poured out upon its soil like water. But when the Loyalists\r\nsought refuge there, what was it? Before the war, the fisheries of its\r\ncoast, for the prosecution of which Halifax itself was founded,\r\ncomprised, in public estimation, its chief value; and though Great\r\nBritain had quietly possessed it for about seventy years, the emigration\r\nto it of the adherents of the Crown from the United States, in a single\r\nyear, more than doubled its population. Until hostile events brought\r\nHalifax into notice, no civilized people were poorer than the\r\ninhabitants of that colony; since, in 1775, the Assembly estimated that\r\n£1,200 currency--a sum less than $5,000--was the whole amount of money\r\nwhich they possessed. By causing the expatriation, then, of many\r\nthousands of our countrymen, among whom were the well-educated, the\r\nambitious, and the well-versed in politics, we became the founders of\r\ntwo agricultural and commercial colonies; for it is to be remembered\r\nthat New Brunswick formed a part of Nova Scotia until 1784, and that the\r\nnecessity of the division then made was of our own creation. In like\r\nmanner we became the founders of Upper Canada. The Loyalists were the\r\nfirst settlers of the territory thus denominated by Act of 1791; and the\r\nprincipal object of the line of division of Canada, as established by\r\nMr. Pitt's Act, was to place them, as a body, by themselves, and to\r\nallow them to be governed by laws more congenial than those which were\r\ndeemed requisite for the government of the French on the St. Lawrence.\r\nOur expatriated countrymen were generally poor, and some of them were\r\nactually without the means of providing for their common wants from day\r\nto day. The Government for which they had become exiles was as liberal\r\nas they could have asked. It gave them lands, tools, materials for\r\nbuilding, and the means of subsistence for two years; and to each of\r\ntheir children, as they became of age, two hundred acres of land. And\r\nbesides this, of the offices created by the organization of a new\r\nColonial Government, they were the chief recipients. The ties of kindred\r\nand suffering in a common cause created a strong bond of sympathy\r\nbetween them, and for years they bore the appellation of 'United Empire\r\nLoyalists.'\"[120]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Writing under date of January, 1782, Mr. Hildreth says:\r\n\"The surrender of Cornwallis was soon felt in the Southern department.\r\nWilmington was evacuated, thus dashing all the hopes of the North\r\nCarolina Tories. Greene approached Charleston, and distributed his\r\ntroops so as to confine the enemy to the neck and adjacent islands.\r\n\r\n\"In re-establishing the State Government of _South Carolina, none were\r\nallowed to vote who had taken British protection_. John Matthews was\r\nelected Governor. Among the earliest proceedings of the Assembly was the\r\npassage of a law _banishing the most active British partisans and\r\nconfiscating their property_. The services of Greene were also\r\ngratefully remembered in a vote of 10,000 guineas, or $50,000, to\r\npurchase him an estate.\r\n\r\n\"The Georgia Assembly, in meeting at Augusta, chose John Martin as\r\nGovernor, _and passed a law of confiscation and banishment very similar\r\nto that of South Carolina_. Greene presently received from this\r\nProvince, also, the present of a confiscated plantation. _North\r\nCarolina_ acknowledged his services by a grant of wild lands.\" (History\r\nof the United States, Vol. III., Chap. xliii., p. 373.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Dr. Ramsay's History of the United States, Vol. II.,\r\nChap, xxv., p. 456.\r\n\r\n\"Under the immediate eye of Cornwallis,\" says Mr. Bancroft, \"the\r\nprisoners who had capitulated in Charleston were the subjects of\r\nperpetual persecution, unless they would exchange their paroles for\r\noaths of allegiance.

The chain of forts for holding South Carolina consisted of\r\nGeorgetown, Charleston, Beaufort, and Savannah on the sea; Augusta,\r\nNinety-Six, and Camden in the interior. Of these, Camden was the most\r\nimportant, for it was the key between the north and south. On the rumour\r\nof an advancing American army, Rawdon called on all the inhabitants\r\nround Camden to join in arms. One hundred and sixty who refused he shut\r\nup during the heat of midsummer in one prison, and loaded more than\r\ntwenty of them with chains, some of whom were protected by the\r\ncapitulation of Charleston.\" (Bancroft's History of the United States,\r\nVol. X., Chap. xv., pp. 311, 312, 313.)\r\n\r\n\"Peace was restored to Georgia (July, 1782), after having been four\r\nyears in possession of the British.

TO CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, AND\r\nREMARKS ON THE FEELINGS WHICH SHOULD NOW BE CULTIVATED BY BOTH OF THE\r\nFORMER CONTENDING PARTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entire failure of the Americans to conquer Canada in the war of\r\n1812-1815 is an illustration of the folly of coercing the allegiance of\r\na people against their will. Upper Canada at that time consisted of less\r\nthan 100,000 inhabitants; yet, with the extra aid of only a few hundred\r\nEnglish soldiers, she repelled for three years the forces of the United\r\nStates--more than ten times their number, and separated only by a river.\r\n\r\nMr. J.M. Ludlow, in his brief but comprehensive \"History of the War of\r\nAmerican Independence, 1775-1783,\" Chapter vii., well states _the folly\r\nof England in endeavouring to conquer by arms the opinions_ of three\r\nmillions of people, and the impossibility of the American colonists\r\nachieving their independence without the aid of men and money, and ships\r\nfrom France, to which, in connection with Spain and Holland, the\r\nAmericans are actually indebted for their independence, and not merely\r\nto their own sole strength and prowess, as American writers so\r\nuniversally boast. Mr. Ludlow observes:\r\n\r\n\"At a time when steam had not yet baffled the winds, to dream of\r\nconquering by force of arms, on the other side of the Atlantic, a people\r\nof the English race, numbering between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000, with\r\nsomething like 1,200 miles of seaboard, was surely an act of enormous\r\nfolly. We have seen in our own days the difficulties experienced by the\r\nfar more powerful and populous Northern States in quelling the secession\r\nof the Southern, when between the two there was no other frontier than\r\nat most a river, very often a mere ideal line, and when armies could be\r\nraised by 100,000 men at a time. England attempted a far more difficult\r\ntask, with forces which, till 1781, never exceeded 35,000 men, and never\r\nafterwards exceeded 42,075, including 'Provincials,' _i.e._, American\r\nLoyalists.\" (But England, repeatedly on the verge of success, failed\r\nfrom the incapacity and inactivity of the English generals.)\r\n\r\n\"Yet it is impossible to doubt that not once only, but repeatedly during\r\nthe course of the struggle, England was on the verge of triumph. The\r\nAmerican armies were perpetually melting away before the\r\nenemy--directly, through the practice of short enlistments; indirectly,\r\nthrough desertions. These desertions, if they might be often palliated\r\nby the straits to which the men were reduced through arrears of pay and\r\nwant of supplies, arose in other cases, as after the retreat from New\r\nYork, from sheer loss of heart in the cause. The main army, under\r\nWashington, was seldom even equal in numbers to that opposed to him. In\r\nthe winter of 1776-77, when his troops were only 4,000 strong, it is\r\ndifficult to understand how it was that Sir William Howe, with more\r\nthan double the number, should have failed to annihilate the American\r\narmy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WEAKNESS OF THE AMERICAN ARMY.\r\n\r\n\"In the winter of 1777-78 the 'dreadful situation of the army for want\r\nof provisions,' made Washington 'advise' that they should not have been\r\nexcited to a general mutiny and desertion. In May, 1779, he hardly knew\r\nany resource for the American cause _except in reinforcements from\r\nFrance_, and did not know what might be the consequence if the enemy had\r\nit in their power to press the troops hard in the ensuing campaign. In\r\nDecember of that year his forces were 'mouldering away daily,' and he\r\nconsidered that Sir Henry Clinton, with more than twice his numbers,\r\ncould 'not justify remaining inactive with a force so superior.' A year\r\nlater he was compelled, for want of clothing, to discharge the levies\r\nwhich he had always so much trouble in obtaining; and 'want of flour\r\nwould have disbanded the whole army' if he had not adopted this\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\n\"In March, 1781, again the crisis was 'perilous,' and though he did not\r\ndoubt the happy issue of the contest, he considered that the period for\r\naccomplishment might be too far distant for a person of his years. In\r\nApril he wrote: 'We cannot transport provisions from the States in which\r\nthey are assessed to the army, because we cannot pay the teamsters, who\r\nwill no longer work for certificates. It is equally certain that our\r\ntroops are approaching fast to nakedness, and that we have nothing to\r\nclothe them with; that our hospitals are without medicines, and our sick\r\nwithout nutriment, except such as well men eat; and that all our public\r\nworks are at a stand, and the artificers disbanding. * * It may be\r\ndeclared in a word that we are at the end of our tether, and that now or\r\nnever our deliverance must come.' Six months later, when Yorktown\r\ncapitulated, the British forces remaining in North America, after the\r\nsurrender of that garrison by Cornwallis, were more considerable than\r\nthey had been as late as February, 1779, and Sir Henry Clinton even then\r\ndeclared that with a reinforcement of 10,000 he would be responsible for\r\nthe conquest of America.\r\n\r\n\"_The main hope of success on the English_ side lay in the idea that the\r\nspirit and acts of resistance to the authority of the mother country\r\nwere in reality only on the part of a turbulent minority--that the bulk\r\nof the people desired to be loyal. It is certain indeed that the\r\nstruggle was, in America itself, much more of a civil war than the\r\nAmericans are now generally disposed to admit. In December, 1780, there\r\nwere 8,954 'Provincials' among the British forces in America, and on\r\nMarch 7th, 1781, a letter from Lord George Germaine to Sir H. Clinton,\r\nintercepted by the Americans, says: 'The American levies in the King's\r\nservice are more in number than the whole of the enlisted troops in the\r\nservice of the Congress.' As late as September 1st, 1781, there were\r\n7,241. We hear of loyal 'associations' in Massachusetts, Maryland, and\r\nPennsylvania; of 'associated Loyalists' in New York; and everywhere of\r\n'Tories,' whose arrest Washington is found suggesting to Governor\r\nTrumbull, of Connecticut, as early as November 12th, 1775. But New York,\r\nNew Jersey, and Pennsylvania remained long full of Tories. By June 28th,\r\n1776, the disaffected on Long Island had taken up arms, and after the\r\nevacuation of New York by Washington a brigade of Loyalists was raised\r\non the island, and companies were formed in two neighbouring counties to\r\njoin the King's troops. During Washington's retreat through New Jersey,\r\n'the inhabitants, either from fear or disaffection, almost to a man\r\nrefused to turn out.' In Pennsylvania, the militia, instead of giving\r\nany assistance in repelling the British, exulted at their approach and\r\nover the misfortunes of their countrymen. On the 20th of that month the\r\nBritish were 'daily gathering strength from the disaffected.' In 1777,\r\nthe Tories who joined Burgoyne in his expedition from the North are said\r\nto have doubled his force. In 1778, Tories joined the Indians in the\r\ndevastation of Wyoming and Cherry Valley; and although the\r\nindiscriminate ravages of the British, or of the Germans in their pay,\r\nseem to have aroused the three States above mentioned to self-defence,\r\nyet, as late as May, 1780, Washington still speaks of sending a small\r\nparty of cavalry to escort La Fayette safely through the 'Tory\r\nsettlements' of New York. Virginia, as late as the spring of 1776, was\r\n'alarmed at the idea of independence.' Washington admitted that his\r\ncountrymen (of that State), 'from their form of government, and steady\r\nattachment heretofore to royalty,' would 'come reluctantly' to that\r\nidea, but trusted to 'time and persecution.' In 1781, the ground for\r\ntransferring the seat of war to the Chesapeake was the number of\r\nLoyalists in that quarter. In the Southern States the division of\r\nfeeling was still greater. In the Carolinas, a royalist regiment was\r\nraised in a few days in 1776, and again in 1779. In Georgia and in South\r\nCarolina the bitterest partisan warfare was carried on between Whig and\r\nTory bands; and a body of New York Tories contributed powerfully to the\r\nfall of Savannah in 1778, by taking the American forces in the rear.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the British generals did not receive that support\r\nfrom the Loyalists which they had expected. They seem to have looked\r\nupon the Loyalists as an inferior class of aids to the regular soldiery;\r\ntheir advice seems to have been unsought, and the mode of war pursued\r\nwas European, and not adapted to the peculiar circumstances of America.\r\nThe Loyalist volunteers were looked upon as the rivals to rather than\r\nfellow-soldiers of the regular army; and no provincial Loyalist was\r\npromoted to lead any expedition or command any position of importance.\r\nThis depreciation of the Loyalists by the English (utterly incompetent)\r\ngenerals exactly answered the purposes of American writers. _But the\r\nreal cause of its protraction_, though it may be hard to an American to\r\nadmit the fact, lay in the incapacity of the American politicians, and,\r\nit must be added, in the supineness and want of patriotism of the\r\nAmerican people. If indeed importing into the views of later date, we\r\nlook upon it as one between two nations, the mismanagement of the war by\r\nthe Americans on all points save one--the retention of Washington in the\r\nchief command--is seen to have been so pitiable, from first to last, as\r\nto be in fact almost unintelligible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DESCRIPTION OF THE AMERICAN ARMY, AND THE MANNER OF RAISING IT.\r\n\r\n\"We can only understand the case when we see there was no such thing as\r\nan American nation in existence, but only a number of revolted colonies,\r\njealous of one another, and with no tie but that of common danger. Even\r\nin the army divisions broke out. Washington, in a General Order of\r\nAugust, 1776, says: 'It is with great concern that the general\r\nunderstands that jealousies have arisen among the troops from the\r\ndifferent provinces, and reflections are frequently thrown out which\r\ncan only tend to irritate each other and injure the noble cause in\r\nwhich we are engaged.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WANT OF PUBLIC SPIRIT AND PATRIOTISM IN THE STATES.\r\n\r\n\"It was seldom that much help could be obtained in troops from any\r\nState, unless the State were immediately threatened by the enemy; and\r\neven then these troops would be raised by that State for its own\r\ndefence, irrespectively of the general or 'continental army.' 'Those at\r\na distance from the seat of war,' wrote Washington, in April, 1778,\r\n'live in such perfect tranquillity, that they conceive the dispute to be\r\nin a manner at an end, and those near it are so disaffected that they\r\nserve only as embarrassments.' In January, 1779, we find him\r\nremonstrating with the Governor of Rhode Island, because that State had\r\n'ordered several battalions to be raised for the State only; and this\r\nbefore the proper measures are taken to fill the continental regiments.'\r\nThe different bounties and rates of pay allowed by the various States\r\nwere a constant source of annoyance to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DECLINE OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\"After the first year, the best men were not returned to Congress, and\r\ndid not return to it. Whole States remained frequently unrepresented. In\r\nthe winter of 1777-78, Congress was reduced to twenty-one members. But\r\neven with a full representation it could do little. 'One State will\r\ncomply with a requisition,' writes Washington in 1780, 'another neglects\r\nto do it, a third executes by halves, and all differ either in the\r\nmanner, the matter, or so much in point of time, that we are always\r\nworking up-hill.'\r\n\r\n\"At first, Congress was really nothing more than a voluntary Committee.\r\nWhen the Confederation was completed, which was only, be it remembered,\r\non March 1, 1781, it was still, as Washington wrote in 1785, 'little\r\nmore than a shadow without a substance, and the Congress a nugatory\r\nbody;' or, as it was described by a late writer, 'powerless for\r\ngovernment, and a rope of sand for union.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DECLINE OF ENERGY AND SPIRIT AMONG THE COLONISTS AND ARMY.\r\n\r\n\"Like politicians, like people. There was, no doubt, a brilliant display\r\nof patriotic ardour at the first flying to arms of the colonists.\r\nLexington and Bunker's Hill were actions decidedly creditable to their\r\nraw troops. The expedition to Canada, foolhardy though it proved, was\r\npursued up to a certain point with real heroism. But with it the heroic\r\nperiod of the war (individual instances excepted) may be said to have\r\nclosed. There seems little reason to doubt that the revolution would\r\nnever have been commenced if it had been expected to cost so tough a\r\nstruggle. 'A false estimate of the power and perseverance of our\r\nenemies,' wrote James Duane to Washington, 'was friendly to the present\r\nrevolution, and inspired that confidence of success in all ranks of the\r\npeople which was necessary to unite them in so arduous a cause.' As\r\nearly as November, 1775, Washington wrote, speaking of military\r\narrangements: 'Such a dearth of public spirit, and such want of\r\nvirtue--such stock-jobbing and fertility in all the low arts to obtain\r\nadvantage of one kind or another, I never saw before, and pray God's\r\nmercy that I may never be witness to it again.' Such a 'mercenary\r\nspirit' pervaded the whole of the troops that he should not have been\r\n'at all surprised at any disaster.' At the same date, besides desertion\r\nof thirty or forty soldiers at a time, he speaks of the practice of\r\nplundering as so rife that 'no man is secure in his effects, and\r\nscarcely in his person.' People were 'frightened out of their houses\r\nunder pretence of those houses being ordered to be burnt, with a view of\r\nseizing the goods;' and to conceal the villainy more effectually, some\r\nhouses were actually burned down. On February 28th, 1777, 'the\r\nscandalous loss, waste, and private appropriation of public arms during\r\nthe last campaign' had been 'beyond all conception.' Officers drew\r\n'large sums under pretence of paying their men, and appropriated them.'\r\n\r\n\"'Can we carry on the war much longer?' Washington asks in 1778, after\r\nthe treaty with France and the appearance of the French fleet off the\r\ncoast. 'Certainly not, unless some measures can be devised and speedily\r\nexecuted to restore the credit of our currency and restrain extortion\r\nand punish forestallers.' A few days later: 'To make and extort money in\r\nevery shape that can be devised, and at the same time to decry its\r\nvalue, seems to have become a mere business and an epidemical disease.'\r\nOn December 30th, 1778, 'speculation, peculation, and an insatiable\r\nthirst for riches seems to have got the better of every consideration,\r\nand almost of every order of men; * * party disputes and personal\r\nquarrels are the great business of the day (in Congress), whilst the\r\nmomentous concerns of an empire, a great and accumulating debt, ruined\r\nfinances, depreciated money, and want of credit, which in its\r\nconsequences is the want of everything, are but secondary\r\nconsiderations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DECLINE OF PATRIOTIC FEELING ON THE PART OF THE AMERICANS.\r\n\r\n\"After the first loan had been obtained from France and spent, and a\r\nfurther one was granted in 1782, so utterly unpatriotic and selfish was\r\nknown to be the temper of the people that the loan had to be kept\r\nsecret, in order not to diminish such efforts as might be made by the\r\nAmericans themselves. On July 10th of that year, with New York and\r\nCharleston still in British hands, Washington writes: 'That spirit of\r\nfreedom which at the commencement of the contest would have gladly\r\nsacrificed everything to the attainment of its object, has long since\r\nsubsided, and every selfish passion has taken its place.' But, indeed,\r\nthe mere fact that from the date of the battle of Monmouth (July 28th,\r\n1778), Washington was never supplied with sufficient means, even with\r\nthe assistance of the French fleets and troops, to strike one blow at\r\nthe English in New York--though these were but very sparingly reinforced\r\nduring the period--shows an absence of public spirit, one might almost\r\nsay of national shame, scarcely conceivable, and in singular contrast\r\nwith the terrible earnestness exhibited on both sides, some eighty years\r\nlater, in the Secession War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"INCAPACITY OF ENGLISH GENERALS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, must we ask on the other side, did the English fail at last?\r\n\r\n\"The English were prone to attribute their ill success to the\r\nincompetency of their generals. Lord North, with his quaint humour,\r\nwould say, 'I do not know whether our generals will frighten the enemy,\r\nbut I know they frighten me whenever I think of them.' When, in 1778,\r\nLord Carlisle came out as Commissioner, in a letter speaking of the\r\ngreat scale of all things in America, he says, 'We have nothing on a\r\ngreat scale with us but our blunders, our losses, our disgraces and\r\nmisfortunes.' No doubt, it is difficult to account for Gage's early\r\nblunders; for Howe's repeated failure to follow up his own success, or\r\nprofit by his enemy's weakness; and Cornwallis's movement, justly\r\ncensured by Sir Henry Clinton, in transferring the bulk of his army from\r\nthe far south to Virginia, within marching distance of Washington,\r\nopened the way to that crowning disaster at Yorktown, without which it\r\nis by no means impossible that Georgia and the Carolinas might have\r\nremained British.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"INEFFECTIVE MILITARY ARRANGEMENTS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\"Political incapacity was, of course, charged upon Ministers as another\r\ncause of disaster; and no doubt their miscalculation of the severity of\r\nthe struggle was almost childish. But no mistakes in the management of\r\nthe war by British statesmen can account for their ultimate failure.\r\nHowever great British mismanagement may have been, it was far surpassed\r\nby the Americans. There was nothing on the British side equal to that\r\ncaricature of a recruiting system in which different bounties were\r\noffered by Congress, by the States, by the separate towns, so as to make\r\nit the interest of the intended soldier to delay enlistment as long as\r\npossible, in order to sell himself to the highest bidder; to that\r\ncaricature of a war establishment, the main bulk of which broke up every\r\ntwelvemonth in front of the enemy, which was only paid, if at all, in\r\nworthless paper, and left continually without supplies. On the whole, no\r\nbetter idea can be had of the nature of the struggle on the American\r\nside, after the first heat of it had cooled down, than from the words of\r\nCount de Rochambeau, writing to Count de Vergennes, July 10th, 1780:\r\n'They have neither money nor credit; their means of resistance are only\r\nmomentary, and called forth when they are attacked in their own homes.\r\nThey then assemble for the moment of immediate danger and defend\r\nthemselves.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FRENCH MONEY, TROOPS, AND SHIPS TURN THE SCALE IN FAVOUR OF AMERICAN\r\nINDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n\"A far more important cause in determining the ultimate failure of the\r\nBritish was the aid afforded by France to America, followed by that of\r\nSpain and Holland. It was impossible for England to re-conquer a\r\ncontinent and carry on a war at the same time with the three most\r\npowerful naval States of Europe. The instincts of race have tended on\r\nboth the English and American side to depreciate the value of the aid\r\ngiven by France to the colonists. It may be true that Rochambeau's\r\ntroops, which disembarked on Rhode Island in July, 1780, did not march\r\ntill July, 1781; that they were blockaded soon after their arrival,\r\nthreatened with attack from New York, and only disengaged by a feint of\r\nWashington's on that city. But more than two years before their arrival,\r\nWashington wrote to a member of Congress: 'France, by her supplies, has\r\nsaved us from the yoke thus far.' The treaty with France alone was\r\nconsidered to afford a 'certain prospect of success' to 'secure'\r\nAmerican independence. The arrival of D'Estaing's fleet, although no\r\ntroops joined the American army, and nothing eventually was done,\r\ndetermined the evacuation of Philadelphia. The discipline of the French\r\ntroops, when they landed in 1780, set an example to the Americans;\r\nchickens and pigs walked between the lines without being disturbed. The\r\nrecruits of 1780 could not have been armed without fifty tons of\r\nammunition supplied by the French. In September of that year,\r\nWashington, writing to the French envoy, speaks of the 'inability' of\r\nthe Americans to expel the British from the South unassisted, or perhaps\r\neven to stop their career; and he writes in similar terms to Congress a\r\nfew days later. To depend 'upon the resources of the country, unassisted\r\nby foreign loans,' he writes to a member of Congress two months later,\r\n'will, I am confident, be to lean upon a broken reed.' In January, 1781,\r\nwriting to Colonel Laurens,[121] the American envoy in Paris, he presses\r\nfor 'an immediate, ample, efficacious succour in money from France,'\r\nalso for the maintenance on the American coasts of 'a constant naval\r\nsuperiority,' and likewise for 'an additional succour in troops.' And\r\nsince the assistance so requested was in fact granted in every shape,\r\nand the surrender of Yorktown was obtained by the co-operation both of\r\nthe French army and fleet, we must hold that Washington's words were\r\njustified by the event.\"[122]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: War of American Independence, 1777-1783, by John Malcolm\r\nLudlow, Chap, vii., pp. 215-227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Dr. Ramsay says: \"Pathetic representations were made to\r\nthe Ministers of his Most Christian Majesty by Washington, Dr. Franklin,\r\nand particularly by Lieutenant-Colonel John Laurens, who was sent to the\r\nCourt of Versailles as a special Minister on this occasion. The King of\r\nFrance _gave_ the United States a subsidy [as a present] of six millions\r\nof livres, and became their security for ten millions more, borrowed for\r\ntheir use in the United Netherlands.\" (History of the United States,\r\nVol. II., Chap. xxiii., p. 407.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B. TO CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS OF LORD MAHON ON THE AMERICAN CONTEST AND ITS\r\nRESULTS--APOLOGY FOR GEORGE THE THIRD--UNHAPPINESS OF AMERICANS SINCE\r\nTHE REVOLUTION--UNITY OF THE ANGLO-SAXON RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this period (Declaration of Independence), the culminating point in\r\nthe whole American war, I may be forgiven for desiring to interrupt its\r\nnarrative in order to review its course and its results. That injurious\r\nand oppressive acts of power had been inflicted by England upon America,\r\nI have in many places shown, and do most fully acknowledge. That from\r\nthe other side, and above all from Massachusetts, there had been strong\r\nprovocation, I must continue to maintain. I should not deem it\r\nconsistent with candour to deny that the Americans had sufficient ground\r\nfor resisting, as they did resist, the Ministerial and Parliamentary\r\nmeasures. But whether these had yet attained a pitch to justify them in\r\ndiscarding and renouncing their allegiance to the Throne is a far more\r\ndoubtful question--a question on which perhaps neither an Englishman nor\r\nyet an American could quite impartially decide.\r\n\r\n\"The time has come, however, as I believe and trust, when it is possible\r\nto do equal justice to the many good and upright men who in this great\r\nstruggle embraced the opposite sides. The great mass of the people meant\r\nhonestly on both shores of the Atlantic. The two chief men in both\r\ncountries were alike pure-minded. On the one side there were deeds that\r\nsavoured of tyranny; on the other side there were deeds that savoured of\r\nrebellion; yet at heart George the Third was never a tyrant, nor\r\nWashington ever a rebel. Of Washington I most firmly believe, that no\r\nsingle act appears in his whole public life proceeding from any other\r\nthan public, and those the highest motives. But my persuasion is no\r\nless firm that there would be little flattery in applying the same terms\r\nof respect and commendation to the 'good old king.' I do not deny,\r\nindeed, that some degree of prejudice and pride may, though\r\nunconsciously, have mingled with his motives. I do not deny that at the\r\noutset of these troubles he lent too ready an ear to the glozing reports\r\nof his governors and deputies, the Hutchinsons or Olivers, Gateses,\r\nDunmores, etc., assuring him that the discontents were confined to a\r\nfactious few, and that measures of rigour and repression alone were\r\nneeded. For such measures of rigour he may deserve, and has incurred,\r\nhis share of censure. But after the insurgent colonies had proclaimed\r\ntheir independence, is it just to blame King George, as he often has\r\nbeen blamed, for his steadfast and resolute resistance to that claim?\r\nWas it for him, unless after straining every nerve against it, to\r\nforfeit a portion of his birthright and a jewel of his crown? Was it for\r\nhim, though the clearest case of necessity, to allow the rending asunder\r\nhis empire--to array for all time to come of several millions of his\r\npeople against the rest? After calling on his loyal subjects in the\r\ncolonies to rise, after requiring and employing their aid, was it for\r\nhim, on any light grounds, to relinquish his cause and theirs, and yield\r\nthem over, unforgiven, to the vengeance of their countrymen? Was it for\r\nhim to overlook the consequences, not even yet, perhaps in their full\r\nextent unfolded, of such a precedent of victory to popular and colonial\r\ninsurrection? May not the King, on the contrary, have deemed that on\r\nsuch a question, touching as it did both his honour and his rights, he\r\nwas bound to be firm--firmer than even the firmest of his Ministers?\r\nNot, of course, that he could be justified for persevering; but in\r\ntruth, he did not so persevere after every reasonable hope had failed.\r\nNot, of course, that he could be excused from continuing to demand, or\r\nto expect, unconditional submission; but, as his own letters to Lord\r\nNorth assure us, such an idea was never harboured in his mind. To do his\r\nduty conscientiously, as he should answer it to God hereafter, and\r\naccording to the lights he had received, such was his unceasing aim and\r\nendeavour from the day when, young but superior to the frailties of\r\nyouth, he first assumed the reins of government, until that dismal\r\nperiod, half a century later, when, bowed down by years and sorrows,\r\nand blind, doubly blind, he concluded his reign, though not, as yet, his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"Before the American war had commenced, and during its first period,\r\nnearly all the statesmen and writers of England argued, or rather took\r\nfor granted as too plain to stand in need of argument, that separation\r\nfrom our colonies would most grievously impair, if not wholly ruin, the\r\nparent State. * * It is worthy of note how much our experience has run\r\ncounter to the general prognostication--how little the loss was felt, or\r\nhow quickly the void was supplied. An historian of high and just\r\nauthority--Mr. Macaulay--has observed that England was never so rich, so\r\ngreat, so formidable to foreign princes, so absolutely mistress of the\r\nsea, as since the alienation of the American colonies. (Essays, Vol.\r\nII.) The true effect of that alienation upon ourselves, as time has\r\nshown, has been not positive, but by comparison it has lain not in the\r\nwithdrawal of wealth and population and resources, but in raising up a\r\nrival State from the same race, and with powers and energies not\r\ninferior to our own.\r\n\r\n\"But how far, and in what degree, has the new form of government\r\npromoted the happiness of the United States themselves? * * It would be\r\nfolly, or worse than folly, to deny that since their independence the\r\nprosperity of the United States has advanced with gigantic strides; that\r\nthey have grown to be a first-rate power; that immense works of public\r\nutility have been achieved with marvellous speed; that the clearing of\r\nnew lands and the building of new cities have been such as to outstrip\r\nthe most sanguine calculations; that among them the working classes have\r\nbeen, in no common degree, well paid and prosperous; that a feeling for\r\nthe national honour is in no country stronger; that the first elements\r\nof education have been most widely diffused; that many good and brave\r\nmen have been trained and are training to the service of the\r\nCommonwealth. But have their independent institutions made them, on the\r\nwhole, a happy and contented people? That, among themselves, is often\r\nproclaimed as undeniable; and certainly among themselves it may not\r\nalways be safely denied. That, however, is not always the impression\r\nconveyed to him who only sojourns in their land, by the careworn faces,\r\nby the hurried steps, by the unsocial meals which he sees, or by the\r\nincessant party cries which he hears around him; by the fretful\r\naspirations and the feverish hopes resulting from the unbounded space of\r\ncompetition open to them without check or barrier; and by the\r\ninnumerable disappointments and heartburnings which in consequence\r\narise. On the true condition of North America, let us mark the\r\ncorrespondence between two of the greatest and most highly gifted of her\r\nsons. There is now open before me a letter which, in August, 1837, and\r\non the annexation of Texas, Dr. Channing wrote to Mr. Clay. In that\r\nletter, as published in Boston, I find the following words (and what Dr\r\nChanning said in 1837 has been illustrated in scores of instances since\r\nthat time, and greatly enhanced by the events of the civil war):\r\n\r\n\"'I cannot do justice to this topic without speaking freely of our\r\ncountry, as freely as I should of any other; and unhappily we are so\r\naccustomed, as a people, to receive incense, to be soothed by flattery,\r\nand to account reputation a more important interest than morality, that\r\nmy freedom may be construed into a kind of disloyalty. But it would be\r\nwrong to make concessions to this dangerous weakness. * * Among us a\r\nspirit of lawlessness pervades the community which, if not repressed,\r\nthreatens the dissolution of our present forms of society. Even in the\r\nold States, mobs are taking the government into their hands, and a\r\nprofligate newspaper finds little difficulty in stirring up multitudes\r\nto violence. * * Add to all this the invasions of the rights of speech\r\nand of the press by lawless force, the extent and toleration of which\r\noblige us to believe that a considerable portion of our citizens have no\r\ncomprehension of the first principles of liberty. It is an undeniable\r\nfact that, in consequence of these and other symptoms, the confidence of\r\nmany reflecting men in our free institutions is very much impaired. Some\r\ndespair. That main pillar of public liberty--mutual trust among\r\ncitizens--is shaken. That we must seek security for property and life in\r\na stronger government is a spreading conviction. Men who in public talk\r\nof the ability of our institutions, whisper their doubts, perhaps their\r\nscorn, in private.\r\n\r\n\"'Whether the people of the United States might have been as thriving\r\nand more happy had they remained British subjects, I will not presume to\r\nsay. Certainly not if violent men like Lord Hillsborough, or corrupt men\r\nlike Mr. Rigby, had continued to take part in the administration. With\r\nother hands at the helm the case might have been otherwise. Jefferson,\r\nat least, in his first draft of the Declaration of Independence, said of\r\nhis countrymen and of the English: \"We might have been a free and great\r\npeople together.\" One thing, at all events, is plain, that had these\r\ncolonies shared the fate of the other dominions of the British Crown,\r\nthe main curse and shame--the plague spot of the system of\r\nslavery--would have been long since removed from them (before it was);\r\nbut, as in the case of Jamaica, not without a large compensation in\r\nmoney to the slave owners. It is also plain that in the case supposed\r\nthey would have equally shared in our pride and glory at the wondrous\r\ngrowth of the Anglo-Saxon race--that race undivided and entire,\r\nextending its branches as now to the furthest regions of the earth, yet\r\nall retaining their connection with the parent stem--all its members\r\nbound by the same laws, all animated by the same loyalty, and all\r\ntending to the same public-spirited aim. How great a nation should we\r\nand they be together!--how great in the arts both of peace and war!\r\nscarcely unequal now to all other nations of the world combined!\" * *\r\n\r\n\"Since 1782 at the latest, views like these are merely day-dreams of the\r\npast. In place of them, let us now indulge the hope and expectation that\r\nthe American people may concur with ours in desiring that no further\r\nresentment may be nourished, no further strife be stirred, between the\r\nkindred nations; so that both, mindful of their common origin, and\r\nconscious of their growing greatness, may both alike discard, as\r\nunworthy of them, all mean and petty jealousies, and be ever henceforth\r\nwhat nature has designed them--friends.\"[123]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Lord Mahon's History of England, etc., Vol. VI., Chap.\r\nliii., pp. 150-160.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE LOYALISTS BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT\r\nAFTER THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT--REFUSAL OF THE STATES TO COMPENSATE THE\r\nLOYALISTS.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen, by the fact stated in the last preceding chapter, that\r\nthe promised recommendations of Congress to the several States, as\r\nagreed upon by the English and American Commissioners of the peace\r\nnegotiations at Paris, were, as had been expected and predicted by Dr.\r\nFranklin at the time, without any result, the State Legislatures passing\r\nActs to proscribe rather than compensate the Loyalists. In justification\r\nof these Acts, the American writers of that period, and largely down to\r\nthe present time, assailed the character of the Loyalists in the\r\ngrossest language of calumny and abuse; but the most respectable\r\nAmerican writers of the present age bear testimony to the intelligence,\r\nwealth, and respectability of the Loyalists; and the fact, no longer\r\nquestionable, that they sacrificed wealth, liberty, country, and chose\r\npoverty and exile, in support of their principles, has fully vindicated\r\ntheir character and presented their conduct in advantageous contrast\r\nwith that of those who deprived them of their liberty, and largely\r\nprofited by the confiscation of their immense property, while they and\r\ntheir families were pining in exile and want.\r\n\r\nThe only resource of the exiled and impoverished Loyalists, under such\r\ncircumstances, was the Government and Parliament of the mother country\r\nto which they had so faithfully adhered, and nothing could be more\r\nhonourable than the testimony borne in the British Parliament to their\r\ncharacter and merits, and the consideration given to their wants and\r\nclaims. The fifth Article of the Treaty of Paris, leaving the Loyalists\r\nto the recommendation of the Congress to the Legislatures of the several\r\nStates, was severely reprobated in both Houses of Parliament. In the\r\nHouse of Commons, Mr. Wilberforce said that \"when he considered the case\r\nof the Loyalists, he confessed he felt himself conquered; there he saw\r\nhis country humiliated; he saw her at the feet of America; still he was\r\ninduced to believe that Congress would religiously comply with the\r\nArticle, and that the Loyalists would obtain redress from America.\r\nShould they not, this country was bound to afford it them. They _must be\r\ncompensated_; Ministers, he was persuaded, meant to keep _the faith of\r\nthe nation with them_.\"\r\n\r\nLord North (who had been Prime Minister during twelve years, including\r\nthe war) said:\r\n\r\n\"And now let me, Sir, pause on a part of the treaty which awakens human\r\nsensibility in a very irresistible and lamentable degree. I cannot but\r\nlament the fate of those unhappy men, who, I conceive, were in general\r\nobjects of our _gratitude_ and _protection_. The Loyalists, from their\r\nattachments, surely had some claim to our affection. But what were not\r\nthe claims of those who, in conformity to their _allegiance_, their\r\n_cheerful obedience_ to the _voice of Parliament_, their confidence in\r\nthe proclamation of our generals, invited under every assurance of\r\n_military, parliamentary, political, and affectionate protection,_\r\nespoused with the hazard of their lives, and the forfeiture of their\r\nproperties, the cause of Great Britain? _I cannot but feel for men thus\r\nsacrificed for their bravery and principles_--men who have sacrificed\r\nall the dearest possessions of the human heart. They have exposed their\r\nlives, endured an age of hardships, deserted their interests, forfeited\r\ntheir possessions, lost their connections, and ruined their families _in\r\nour cause_. Could not all this waste of human enjoyment excite one\r\ndesire of protecting them from a state of misery, with which the\r\nimplacable resentment of the States has desired to punish their loyalty\r\nto their Sovereign and their attachment to their mother country? Had we\r\nnot espoused their cause from a _principle of affection and gratitude_,\r\nwe should, at least, have _protected_ them _to have preserved our own\r\nhonour_. If not tender of _their feelings_, we should have been tender\r\n_of our own character_. Never was the _honour_, the _principles_, the\r\npolicy of a nation so grossly abused as in the desertion of those men,\r\nwho are now exposed to _every punishment_ that _desertion_ and _poverty_\r\ncan inflict, _because they were not rebels_.\"\r\n\r\nLord Mulgrave said: \"The Article respecting the Loyalists he never could\r\nregard but as a lasting monument of _national disgrace_. Nor was this\r\nArticle, in his opinion, more reproachful and derogatory to the _honour\r\nand gratitude_ of Great Britain than it appeared to be wanton and\r\nunnecessary. The honourable gentleman who had made the motion had asked\r\nif those gentlemen who thought the present peace not sufficiently\r\nadvantageous to Great Britain, considering her circumstances, could\r\nconsent to pay the amount which another campaign (twenty millions) would\r\nhave put us to, for the degree of advantage they might think we had a\r\nright to expect? In answer to this, he declared, for one, he had rather,\r\nlarge as the estimated sum in question was, have had it stipulated in\r\nthe treaty, _that Great Britain should apply it to making good the\r\nlosses of the Loyalists_, than that they should have been so _shamefully\r\ndeserted and the national honour so pointedly disgraced_ as it was by\r\nthe fifth Article of the treaty with the United States.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Secretary Townsend_ (afterwards Lord Sydney) said \"he was ready to\r\nadmit that many of the Loyalists had the strongest claims upon the\r\ncountry; and he trusted, should the recommendation of Congress to the\r\nAmerican States prove unsuccessful, which he flattered himself would not\r\nbe the case, _this country_ would feel itself bound _in honour to make\r\nthem full compensation for their losses_.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burke_ said: \"At any rate, it must be agreed on all hands that a\r\nvast number of Loyalists had been deluded by this country, and had\r\nrisked everything in our cause; to such men the _nation owed protection,\r\nand its honour was pledged for their security at all hazards_.\"\r\n\r\n_The Lord Advocate_ said: \"With regard to the Loyalists, they merited\r\n_every possible effort on the part of this country_.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Sheridan_ \"execrated the treatment of those unfortunate men, who,\r\nwithout the least notice taken of their civil and religious rights, were\r\nhanded over as subjects to a power that would not fail to take\r\nvengeance on them for their zeal and attachment to the religion and\r\ngovernment of this country. This was an instance of _British degradation\r\nnot inferior_ to the unmanly petitions to Congress for the wretched\r\nLoyalists. Great Britain at the feet of Congress, suing in vain, was not\r\na humiliation or a stigma greater than the infamy of consigning over the\r\nloyal inhabitants of Florida, as we had done, without any conditions\r\nwhatsoever.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The Honourable Mr. Norton_ said that 'Under the circumstances, he was\r\nwilling to approve of the two former (European treaties with France and\r\nSpain); but on account of the Article relating to the Loyalists, he felt\r\nit impossible to give his assent to the latter.\"\r\n\r\n_Sir Peter Burrell_ said: \"The fate of the Loyalists claimed the\r\ncompassion of every human breast. These helpless, forlorn men, abandoned\r\nby the Ministers of a people on whose _justice, gratitude_, and\r\n_humanity_ they had the best-founded claims, were left at the mercy of a\r\nCongress highly irritated against them. He spoke not from party zeal,\r\nbut as an independent country gentleman, who, unconnected with party,\r\nexpressed the emotions of his heart and gave vent to his honest\r\nindignation.\"\r\n\r\n_Sir William Bootle_ said: \"There was one part of the treaty at which\r\nhis heart bled--the Article relative to the Loyalists. Being a man\r\nhimself, he could not but feel for men so cruelly abandoned to the\r\nmalice of their enemies. It was scandalous; it was disgraceful. Such an\r\nArticle as that ought scarcely on any condition to have been admitted on\r\nour part. They had fought for us and run every hazard to assist our\r\ncause; and when it most behoved us to afford them protection, we\r\ndeserted them.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other members spoke to the same effect. The treaty recognizing\r\nthe Independence of America could not be reversed, as an Act passed the\r\nprevious session had expressly authorized the King and his Cabinet to\r\nmake it; but it was denied that a treaty sacrificing the Loyalists and\r\nmaking the concessions involved had been authorized; in consequence of\r\nwhich an express vote of censure was passed by the Commons by a majority\r\nof seventeen. The Earl of Shelburne, the Prime Minister, forthwith\r\nresigned in consequence of this vote of censure, and it was nearly three\r\nmonths before a new Administration could be formed; and during this\r\nadministrative interregnum affairs were in great confusion.\r\n\r\nIn the _House of Lords, Lord Walsingham_ said that \"he could neither\r\nthink nor speak of the dishonour of leaving these deserving people to\r\ntheir fate with patience.\" _Lord Viscount Townsend_ considered that \"to\r\ndesert men who had constantly adhered to loyalty and attachment, was a\r\ncircumstance of such cruelty as had never before been heard of.\" _Lord\r\nStormont_ said that \"Britain was bound in justice and honour, gratitude\r\nand affection, and by every tie, to provide for and protect them.\" _Lord\r\nSackville_ regarded \"the abandonment of the Loyalists as a thing of so\r\natrocious a kind, that if it had not been painted in all its horrid\r\ncolours he should have attempted the ungracious task but never should\r\nhave been able to describe the cruelty in language as strong and\r\nexpressive as were his feelings;\" and again, that \"peace on the\r\nsacrifice of these unhappy subjects must be answered in the sight of God\r\nand man.\" _Lord Loughborough_ said that \"the fifth Article of the treaty\r\nhad excited a general and just indignation, and that neither in ancient\r\nnor modern history had there been so shameful a desertion of men who had\r\nsacrificed all to their duty and to their reliance on British faith.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply, _Lord Shelburne_, the Prime Minister, frankly admitted that\r\nthe Loyalists were left without better provision being made for them\r\n\"from the unhappy _necessity_ of public affairs, which induced the\r\nextremity of submitting the fate of their property to the discretion of\r\ntheir enemies;\" and he continued: \"I have but one answer to give the\r\nHouse--it is the answer I gave my own bleeding heart--a _part_ must be\r\nwounded, that the whole of the empire may not perish. If better terms\r\ncould be had, think you, my lords, that I would not have embraced them?\r\n_I had but the alternative either to accept the terms proposed or\r\ncontinue the war._\" The _Lord Chancellor_ held that the stipulations of\r\nthe treaty were \"specific,\" and said: \"My own conscious honour will not\r\nallow me to doubt the good faith of others, and my good wishes to the\r\nLoyalists will not let me indiscreetly doubt the disposition of\r\nCongress, since the understanding is that all these unhappy men shall be\r\nprovided for; yet, if it were not so, Parliament could take cognizance\r\nof their case, and impart to each suffering individual that relief\r\nwhich reason, perhaps policy, certainly virtue and religion, required.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the sentiments of members in both Houses of Parliament, and of\r\nboth parties, as to the character and merits of the Loyalists. But there\r\nwere no prospects of the States compensating them for their losses.\r\nIndeed, this idea was entertained by Lord Shelburne himself, and that\r\ncompensation would have to be made to the Loyalists by Parliament when,\r\nin the speech above quoted, he said that \"without one drop of blood\r\nspilt, and without one-fifth of the expense of one year's campaign,\r\nhappiness and ease can be given to them in as ample a manner as these\r\nblessings were ever in their enjoyment.\" This was certainly a very low\r\nand mercenary view of the subject. It was one thing for the Loyalists to\r\nhave their rights as British subjects maintained while they were obeying\r\nthe commands of the King and maintaining their allegiance to the empire,\r\nand another thing for them to become pensioners upon the bounty of the\r\nBritish Parliament, to be paid in pounds, shillings, and pence for the\r\nrights and privileges which should have been secured to them by national\r\ntreaty as British subjects. The House of Commons had adopted a\r\nresolution against continuing the American war for the _purpose of\r\nenforcing the submission of the colonies_; but it had not resolved\r\nagainst continuing the war to protect the rights and property of British\r\nsubjects in the colonies. A campaign for this purpose, on the refusal of\r\nthe American Commissioners to recognize what was sanctioned by the laws\r\nand usages of nations, would have been honourable to the British\r\nGovernment, would have been popular in England, and would have divided\r\nAmerica; for there were many thousand \"Whigs\" in America, who believed\r\nin the equity of treating the Loyalists after the war as all others were\r\ntreated who conformed to the laws, as has been the case in Holland,\r\nIreland, and Spain. England was then mistress of the seas, held New\r\nYork, Charleston, Rhode Island, Penobscot, and other military posts, and\r\ncould soon have induced the Americans to do what their Peace\r\nCommissioners at Paris had refused to do--place British subjects in\r\nAmerica upon the same footing as to property that they possessed before\r\nthe war, and that they possess in the United States at this day. England\r\ncould have easily and successfully refused granting to the United\r\nStates a foot of land beyond the limits of the thirteen colonies, and\r\nthus have secured those vast western territories now constituting the\r\nlarger part of the United States, and retained the garrisons of New\r\nYork, Rhode Island, and Charleston as guarantees until the stipulated\r\nconditions in regard to the Loyalists should be fulfilled. A joint\r\nCommission in America could have settled upon equitable grounds all\r\ndisputed claims in much less time than the six years occupied by a\r\nParliamentary Commission in examining into and deciding upon the\r\nindividual claims of Loyalist claimants. If the war to reduce the\r\ncolonies to absolute submission had been unpopular in England, the peace\r\nupon the terms submitted to by the English Commissioners and the\r\nMinistry was equally unpopular. If England had been wrong in its war of\r\ncoercion against the revolting colonists, was she not equally wrong, and\r\nmore than wrong, in abandoning to their enemies those who had abided\r\nfaithful to her laws and commands? The language of the speeches of\r\nmembers of both Houses of Parliament, above quoted, is as just as it is\r\nsevere; although much could be and was said in justification of the\r\npolicy of the Government in promoting peace upon almost any terms,\r\nseeing that England was at war with the three most powerful naval\r\nnations of Europe, besides that in America.\r\n\r\nThe fallacy of the argument employed by the advocates of the treaty,\r\nthat the Americans would honourably fulfil the recommendations of\r\nCongress, was illustrated by the following facts:\r\n\r\n\"The province of Virginia, a short time before the peace, had come to an\r\nunanimous conclusion 'that all demands or requests of the British Court\r\nfor the restoration of property confiscated by the State were wholly\r\nimpossible; and that their delegates should be instructed to move\r\nCongress that they should direct the deputies for adjusting peace not to\r\nagree to any such restitution.'\"\r\n\r\n_The State of New York_ resolved, \"That it appears to this Legislature\r\nthat divers of the inhabitants of this State have continued to adhere to\r\nthe King of Great Britain, after these States were declared free and\r\nindependent, and persevered in aiding the said king, his fleets and\r\narmies, to subjugate the United States to bondage: Resolved, That as on\r\nthe one hand the scales of justice do not require, so on the other the\r\npublic tranquillity will not permit, that such adherents who have been\r\nattainted should be restored to the rights of citizens, and that there\r\ncan be no reason for restoring property which has been confiscated or\r\nforfeited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nAGENTS OF LOYALISTS--PROCEEDINGS OF PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION--RESULTS.\r\n\r\nOf course all hope of obtaining relief under the stipulations of the\r\ntreaty was abandoned by the Loyalists, who \"now applied to the\r\nGovernment which they had ruined themselves to serve, and many of them,\r\nwho had hitherto been 'refugees' in different parts of America, went to\r\nEngland to state and recover payment for their losses. They organized an\r\nagency, and appointed a Committee composed of one delegate or agent from\r\neach of the thirteen States,[124] to enlighten the British public, and\r\nadopt measures of proceeding in securing the attention and action of the\r\nBritish Ministry in their behalf. In a tract printed by order of these\r\nagents (which now lies before us, entitled _The Case and Claim of\r\nAmerican Loyalists impartially Stated and Considered_, published in\r\n1783), it is maintained that 'it is an established rule, that all\r\nsacrifices made by individuals for the benefit and accommodation of\r\nothers shall be equally sustained by all those who partake of it,' and\r\nnumerous cases are cited from Puffendorf, Burlamaqui and Vattel, to show\r\nthat the 'sacrifices' of the Loyalists were embraced in this principle.\r\nAs a further ground of claim, it is stated that in case of territory\r\nalienated or ceded away by one sovereign power to another, the rule is\r\nstill applicable; for that in the treaties of international law it is\r\nheld, 'The State ought to indemnify the subject for the loss he has\r\nsustained beyond his proportion.' And in the course pursued at the close\r\nof the civil war in Spain, when the States of Holland obtained their\r\nindependence, under the Treaty of Utrecht, and at various other periods,\r\nproved that the _rights_ of persons similarly situated had been\r\nrespected and held inviolate. The conclusion arrived at from the\r\nprecedents in history, and diplomacy, and in the statute-books of the\r\nrealm, is, that as the Loyalists were as 'perfectly subjects of the\r\nBritish State as any man in London or Middlesex, they were entitled to\r\nthe same protection and relief.' The claimants had been 'called by their\r\nsovereign, when surrounded by tumult and rebellion, to defend the\r\nsupreme rights of the nation, and to assist in suppressing a rebellion\r\nwhich aimed at their destruction. They have received from the highest\r\nauthority the most solemn assurances of protection, and even reward, for\r\ntheir meritorious services;' and that 'His Majesty and the two Houses of\r\nParliament having thought it necessary, as the _price of peace_, or to\r\nthe interest and safety of the empire, or from some other motive of\r\npublic convenience, to ratify the Independence of America, _without\r\nsecuring any restitution whatever to the Loyalists_, they conceive that\r\nthe nation is bound, as well by the fundamental laws of society as by\r\nthe invariable and external principles of natural justice, to make them\r\ncompensation.'\"[125]\r\n\r\nThough the treaty of peace left the Loyalists to the mercy--rather to\r\nthe resentment (as the result proved)--of the American States, and as\r\nsuch received the censure of the House of Commons, British justice and\r\nhonour recognized the claims of the Loyalists to compensation for their\r\nlosses, as well as to gratitude for their fidelity to the unity of the\r\nempire. The King, at the opening of the session of Parliament, said: \"I\r\nhave ordered inquiry to be made into the application of the sum to be\r\nvoted in support of the American sufferers; and I trust you will agree\r\nwith me, that a due and generous attention ought to be shown to those\r\nwho have relinquished their properties or professions from motives of\r\nloyalty to me, or attachment to the mother country.\" Accordingly, a\r\nBill was introduced and passed without opposition in June, 1783,\r\nentitled \"An Act Appointing Commissioners to Inquire into the Losses and\r\nServices of all such Persons who have Suffered in their Rights,\r\nProperties, and Professions, during the late Unhappy Dissensions in\r\nAmerica, in consequence of their Loyalty to his Majesty and Attachment\r\nto the British Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners named were John Wilmot, M.P., Daniel Parker Coke,\r\nM.P., Esquires, Col. Robert Kingston, Col. Thomas Dundas, and John\r\nMarsh, Esquire, who, after preliminary preparations, began their inquiry\r\nin the first week of October, and proceeded, with short intermissions,\r\nthrough the following winter and spring. The time for presenting claims\r\nwas first limited by the Act to the 20th of March, 1784; but the time\r\nwas extended by the renewal of the Act, from time to time, until 1789,\r\nwhen the Commissioners presented their _twelfth_ and last report, and\r\nParliament finally disposed of the whole matter in 1790, seven years\r\nafter its commencement.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners, according to their first report, divided the\r\nLoyalists into _six_ classes, as follows: 1. Those who had rendered\r\nservice to Great Britain. 2. Those who had borne arms for Great Britain.\r\n3. Uniform Loyalists. 4. Loyal English subjects resident in Great\r\nBritain. 5. Loyalists who had taken oaths to the American States, but\r\nafterwards joined the British. 6. Loyalists who had borne arms for the\r\nAmerican States, but afterwards joined the British navy or army. The\r\nreason for this classification is not very apparent; for all showed\r\nalike who were able to establish their losses, without reference to\r\ndifferences of merit, or the time or circumstances of their adhering to\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\nEvery applicant was required to furnish proof of his loyalty, and of\r\nevery species of loss for which he claimed compensation; in addition to\r\nwhich each claimant was put upon his oath as to his alleged losses; and\r\nif in any case _perjury_ or _fraud_ were believed to have been\r\npractised, the claimant was at once cut off from his whole claim. The\r\nrigid rules which the Commissioners laid down and enforced in regard to\r\nclaimants, examining each claimant and the witnesses in his behalf\r\nseparately and apart, caused much dissatisfaction, and gave the\r\nproceeding more the character of an Inquisition than of Inquiry. It\r\nseemed to place the claimants almost in the position of criminals on\r\nwhom rested the burden of proof to establish their own innocence and\r\ncharacter, rather than in that of Loyalists who had faithfully served\r\ntheir King and country, and lost their homes and possessions in doing\r\nso. Very many, probably the large majority of claimants, could not\r\npossibly prove the exact value of each species of loss which they had\r\nsustained years before, in houses, goods, stocks of cattle, fields with\r\ntheir crops and produce, woods with their timber, etc., etc. In such a\r\nproceeding the most unscrupulous would be likely to fare the best, and\r\nthe most scrupulous and conscientious the worst; and it is alleged that\r\nmany false losses were allowed to persons who had suffered no loss,\r\nwhile many other sufferers received no compensation, because they had\r\nnot the means of bringing witnesses from America to _prove_ their\r\nlosses, in addition to their own testimony.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Commission admits the delay and difficulty caused by\r\nthe mode of proceeding adopted by the Commissioners. He says: \"The\r\ninvestigation of the property of each claimant, and of the value of each\r\narticle of that property, real and personal, could not but be attended\r\nwith a good deal of time as well as much caution and difficulty, each\r\nclaim in fact branching out into so many articles, or rather distinct\r\ncauses, in which the Commissioners were obliged to execute the office of\r\nboth judge and jury, or rather of arbitrators between the nation on one\r\nside, and the individual on the other, whose whole patrimony as well as\r\ncharacter depended on their verdict.\"[126]\r\n\r\nThe Act passed in 1783, authorizing the inquiry, being limited to two\r\nyears, expired in July, 1785, but was renewed with some additions, one\r\nof which was a clause to empower the Commissioners to appoint proper\r\npersons to repair to America \"to inquire into such circumstances as they\r\nmight think material for better ascertaining the several claims which\r\nhad been or should be presented to them under this or the former Act of\r\nParliament.\" The Commissioners appointed John Anstey, Esq., a\r\nbarrister-at-law, as agent to the United States, \"to obtain information\r\nas to the confiscation, sale, and value of landed estates, and the total\r\nloss of the property of the claimants,\" respecting which he procured\r\nmuch valuable and authentic information and testimony. They sent Colonel\r\nThomas Dundas and Mr. Jeremy Pemberton, two members of the Board, to\r\nvisit Nova Scotia and Canada, \"to inquire into the claims of such\r\npersons as could not without great inconvenience go over to Great\r\nBritain.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the 25th of March, 1784, the latest period allowed by the first\r\nAct for presenting claims, the number of claimants was 2,063, and the\r\nproperty alleged by them to have been lost, according to their\r\nschedules, amounted to £7,046,278, besides debts to the amount of\r\n£2,354,135. The sum was very large, but the losses were undoubtedly very\r\ngreat. The Commissioners made their first report in July, 1784; and\r\nafter having detailed their assiduous proceeding in the fulfilment of\r\ntheir trust, and care in examining and deciding on individual cases,\r\nreported on the part of the cases submitted, and awarded £201,750 for\r\n£534,705 claimed, reducing the amount by more than half the amount\r\nclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ report of the Commissioners was made in December of the\r\nsame year, and states that 128 additional cases had been examined and\r\ndisposed of, the amount claimed being £693,257, and the amount allowed\r\nwas £150,935--less than one-fourth the amount claimed.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-two (122) cases were examined into and disposed\r\nof in May and July, 1785, according to the third and fourth reports--the\r\namount claimed being £898,196, and the amount allowed being\r\n£253,613--less than one-third of the amount claimed.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1786, the fifth report of the Commissioners was presented,\r\nannouncing that 142 other claims had been considered and decided, the\r\nclaims amounting to £733,311, on which the Commissioners allowed\r\n£250,506--a little more than one-third of the amount claimed.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners proceeded in the same manner with their\r\ninvestigations, and with about the same results, in 1786 and 1787.[127]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April, 1788, the Commissioners reported that they had\r\nexamined into and declared upon 1,680 claims, and had allowed the sum of\r\n£1,887,548 for their payment.\r\n\r\nUnder all the circumstances, it appears scarcely possible that the\r\nCommissioners could have proceeded with more despatch than they did. But\r\nthe delay caused much dissatisfaction among the Loyalists, whose agents\r\npetitioned both King and Parliament on the delay, or on the course\r\npursued by the Commissioners, or on some subject connected with the\r\nclaims of the Loyalists. Essays and tracts were published; letters and\r\ncommunications appeared in the newspapers on the subject; in 1786, the\r\nagents of the Loyalists presented a petition to Parliament, which\r\ncontained among other things the following touching words: \"It is\r\nimpossible to describe the poignant distress under which many of these\r\npersons now labour, and which must daily increase should the justice of\r\nParliament be delayed until all the claims are liquidated and reported;\r\n* * ten years have elapsed since many of them have been deprived of\r\ntheir fortunes, and with their helpless families reduced from\r\nindependent affluence to poverty and want; some of them now languishing\r\nin British jails; others indebted to their creditors, who have lent them\r\nmoney barely to support their existence, and who, unless speedily\r\nrelieved, must sink more than the value of their claims when received,\r\nand be in a worse condition than if they had never made them; others\r\nhave already sunk under the pressure and severity of their misfortunes;\r\nand others must, in all probability, soon meet the same melancholy fate,\r\nshould the justice due them be longer postponed. But, on the contrary,\r\nshould provision be now made for payment of those whose claims have been\r\nsettled and reported, it will not only relieve them from their distress,\r\nbut give credit to others whose claims remain to be considered, and\r\nenable all of them to provide for their wretched families, and become\r\nagain useful members of society.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1788, a tract was published by a Loyalist, entitled\r\n\"The Claim of the American Loyalists Reviewed and Maintained upon\r\nIncontrovertible Principles of Law and Justice.\" The writer of that\r\ntract thus forcibly states the situation of the Loyalists: \"It is well\r\nknown that this delay of justice has produced the most melancholy and\r\nshocking events. A number of sufferers have been driven into insanity\r\nand become their own destroyers, leaving behind them their helpless\r\nwidows and orphans to subsist upon the cold charity of strangers. Others\r\nhave been sent to cultivate the wilderness for their subsistence,\r\nwithout having the means, and compelled through want to throw themselves\r\non the mercy of the American States, and the charity of former friends,\r\nto support the life which might have been made comfortable by the money\r\nlong since due by the British Government; and many others with their\r\nfamilies are barely subsisting upon a temporary allowance from\r\nGovernment, a mere pittance when compared with the sum due them.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the publication of the pamphlet containing these\r\nstatements, the Commissioners submitted their eleventh report, April,\r\n1788, and Mr. Pitt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, yielded the following\r\nmonth to the pressing entreaties of the claimants to allow their\r\ngrievances to be discussed in Parliament. \"Twelve years had elapsed\r\nsince the property of most of them had been alienated under the\r\nConfiscation Acts, and five since their title to recompense had been\r\nrecognized by the law under which their claims had been presented and\r\ndisposed of.\"\r\n\r\nWe will give an abridged account of the proceedings in Parliament and by\r\nthe Commissioners in their own words:\r\n\r\n\"The business came on in the House of Commons on the 6th of June, 1788,\r\nwhich Mr. Pitt opened in a very handsome and eloquent speech respecting\r\nthe merits of the American Loyalists, and which, he did not doubt, would\r\nmeet with the unanimous acknowledgment of the House; and he trusted,\r\ntherefore, there would be no difference of opinion as to the principle,\r\nthough there might be as to the mode of compensation and the\r\ndistribution which he thought it his duty to propose.\r\n\r\n\"The first principle he laid down was, that however strong their claims\r\nmight be on the generosity of the nation, the compensation could not be\r\nconsidered as _a matter of right and strict justice_;[129] in the mode,\r\ntherefore, he had pursued, he had marked the principle in the various\r\nquotas of compensation he should propose to be made to the various\r\nclasses of the American Loyalists.\r\n\r\n\"He considered the three first classes of them, stated by the\r\nCommissioners in their reports as the most meritorious, and who were\r\nlikewise the most numerous, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"1st. Loyalists who had rendered services to Great Britain. Number, 204.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. Loyalists who had borne arms in the service of Great Britain--481.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. Zealous and uniform Loyalists--626.\r\n\r\n\"Total number of these three classes--1,311.\r\n\r\n\"The number of the remaining classes were much fewer, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"4th. Loyal British subjects resident in Great Britain--20.\r\n\r\n\"5th. Who took the oath to the Americans, but afterwards joined the\r\nBritish--27.\r\n\r\n\"6th.

Loyal British subjects who appear to have relief by the Treaty of\r\nPeace, but state the impossibility of procuring it--4.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pitt proposed to pay classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, whose liquidated\r\nlosses did not amount to more than £10,000 each, the full amount of\r\ntheir losses; and if they should exceed the sum of £10,000, to deduct\r\nthe sum of ten per cent. from excess only of £10,000, provided such\r\nlosses did not exceed £35,000; and if they exceeded £35,000, then\r\nfifteen per cent. from the excess of £10,000, and not above £50,000; and\r\nif they exceeded £50,000, then to deduct twenty per cent. from the\r\nexcess of £10,000; and which principle, he informed the Committee, he\r\nmeant to follow in every other class.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the 4th and 8th classes, viz., of loyal British subjects\r\nand loyal British proprietors resident in Great Britain during the war,\r\nhe did not mean to propose any deduction from the losses under £10,000;\r\nbut from the losses which amounted from £10,000 to £50,000 he proposed a\r\ndeduction of twenty per cent. should be made; and a further deduction\r\nfrom those losses amounting to above £50,000, and a still further\r\ndeduction of seventy per cent. from those from £50,000 to £200,000; and\r\nso on in proportion.\r\n\r\n\"He next considered the case of those Loyalists whose losses\r\nprincipally, if not solely, arose from their loss of office or\r\nprofession, by which they had been deprived of their livelihood, or\r\nmeans of support, both for themselves or families. These persons were\r\ndistinct from those who had been in trade or other branches of business,\r\nor gained their livelihood by their manual labour. Though these losses\r\nwere not of so substantial a nature as those who lost property real or\r\npersonal, yet they could not be easily reinstated in the same lucrative\r\nprofessions which they had enjoyed--civil employment, in the law, in the\r\nChurch, or in physic--and therefore he thought them entitled to a\r\nliberal compensation. But as they were not precluded from exercising\r\ntheir industry and talents in this country, he proposed that all those\r\npersons who were reported by Commissioners to have lost incomes not\r\nexceeding £400 _per annum_, should receive pensions at the rate of £50\r\n_per cent._ of such income, and £40 _per cent._ for every £100 above\r\n£400 per annum; where the value did not exceed £1,500 _per annum_, £30\r\n_per cent._ for every £100 per annum exceeding £400; thus the\r\n_percentage_ would be governed by and diminish in proportion to the\r\nincrease of the income lost.\r\n\r\n\"Having expatiated on these various classes of claimants, Mr. Pitt said\r\nhe meant to propose that the amount of these various sums should be\r\nissued in debentures bearing interest at three and a half per cent.,\r\nwhich would be nearly equal to a money payment, and that the whole\r\nshould be paid off by instalments.\r\n\r\n\"He began, therefore, by moving 'that provision should be made\r\naccordingly.'\r\n\r\n\"This plan met with general approbation and applause from all sides of\r\nthe House; not only from the friends of the Minister, but from leaders\r\nof the Opposition, particularly from Mr. Fox and Mr. Burke; and Mr. Pitt\r\ncongratulated the House on their concurrence with him in the plan he\r\nlaid before the Committee.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after a motion was made for continuing the Act another year, for\r\nthe purpose principally of enabling the Commissioners to inquire into\r\nclaims of certain other persons therein specified, who, it was stated,\r\nappeared to have been prevented by particular circumstances from\r\npreferring their claims before; provided the Commissioners were\r\nsatisfied, by proof made on oath, with the reasons assigned by those\r\npersons for not having before preferred their respective claims; and the\r\nAct passed, including these and other purposes.\r\n\r\n\"As the Commissioners who had gone to Nova Scotia and Canada had by this\r\ntime returned to England, and Mr. Anstey was daily expected from the\r\nUnited States, there was more than sufficient to employ the\r\nCommissioners, independent of the Act for carrying into effect the plan\r\nof relief and compensation into execution.\r\n\r\n\"The Commissioners immediately, viz., in August, 1788, proceeded with\r\nthe various matters referred to them.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Dundas and Mr. Pemberton, having returned from Nova Scotia and\r\nCanada, made a separate report of the proceedings to the Board of\r\nTreasury and the Secretaries of State;[130] but the Commissioners,\r\nbefore they finished their deliberations, united the proceedings of both\r\nBoards in order to give a comprehensive view of the whole.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Anstey also having returned from the United States in September,\r\nthe Commissioners took a general review of the whole of their\r\nproceedings from the commencement of the inquiry, and were thus enabled\r\nto supply any defects, to correct any mistakes, and to reconsider any\r\npoints in which, perhaps, too great humanity to the individuals on the\r\none hand, or too great anxiety to reduce claims which appeared\r\nexaggerated on the other, might have led them into error.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus wound up the business in the spring of 1789, they presented\r\ntheir twelfth and last Report on the 15th of May; and likewise, pursuant\r\nto the order of the House of Commons of the 10th of June, 1789,\r\npresented a statement of them to that House, comprising the whole of\r\ntheir proceedings in one view, specifying what had been granted by\r\nParliament and what still remained for consideration; but as the\r\ninquiring into these claims was not completed, and the Minister thought\r\nproper to give way once more to strong applications from various\r\npersons, who had been still prevented from preferring or prosecuting\r\ntheir claims under the former Acts of Parliament, the Commission was\r\nrenewed once more, and it was not till the spring of 1790 that the\r\nbusiness was finally settled and adjusted by Parliament. In the\r\nbeginning of April, in consequence of an order of the House of Commons,\r\non the 31st of March, 1790, the Commissioners laid before the House a\r\nstatement of the claims and losses of the American Loyalists up to the\r\n25th of March, 1790, with the terms already granted, and of what\r\nremained for the consideration of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"The general result of this was, that the number of claims preferred in\r\nEngland and Nova Scotia was 3,225--\r\n\r\n\"Of which were examined  3,225\r\n\"Disallowed       343  }\r\n\"Withdrawn         38  }   934\r\n\"Not prosecuted   553  }\r\n\r\n\"The amount of the claims preferred was £10,358,413.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of the claims examined was £8,216,126.\r\n\r\n\"The amount allowed in liquidation thereof amounted to £3,033,091.\r\n\r\n\"Of which had been provided £2,096,326.\r\n\r\n\"There remained for consideration of Parliament £936,764.[131]\r\n\r\n\"The amount of pensions paid to 204 Loyalists, on account of losses of\r\noffice or profession, was £25,785 _per annum_, besides annual allowances\r\nto 588 persons, chiefly widows, orphans, and merchants, who had no means\r\nof livelihood, but had lost no real or personal estate except debts due\r\nthem,[132] and which had not been gone into for reasons before given.\r\n\r\n\"As many of the Loyalists who had received pensions or allowances are\r\nsince deceased, the Lords of the Treasury, by his Majesty's direction,\r\nhave continued some part of those annual payments to their widows.\r\n\r\n\"Thus had the nation extended an inquiry for seven successive years into\r\nthe losses of those who, from motives of loyalty to his Majesty and\r\nattachment to the British Government, had risked their lives and\r\nsacrificed their fortunes in support of the constitutional dependence of\r\nthe colonies on Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be said of this unfortunate war, either to account for, to\r\njustify, or to apologize for the conduct of either country, all the\r\nworld has been unanimous in applauding the virtue and humanity of Great\r\nBritain in rewarding the services, and in compensating, with a liberal\r\nhand, the losses of those who suffered so much for their firm and\r\nfaithful adherence to the British Government.\"\r\n\r\nWe will conclude these extracts by giving the Commissioners' account of\r\ntheir mode of proceeding and the reasons for it, together with the\r\nacknowledgment of the agents of the claimants in a formal address to the\r\nKing:\r\n\r\n\"The principle which has directed our mode of conducting the inquiry,\"\r\nsay the Commissioners, \"has been that of requiring the very best\r\nevidence which the nature and circumstances of the case would admit. We\r\nhave in no instance hitherto thought fit to dispense with the personal\r\nappearance and examination of the claimant, conceiving the inquiry would\r\nbe extremely imperfect and insecure against fraud and misrepresentation\r\nif we had not the advantage of cross-examining the party himself, as\r\nwell as his witnesses; nor have we, for the same reason, allowed much\r\nweight to any testimony that has not been delivered on oath before\r\nourselves. We have investigated with great strictness the titles to real\r\nproperty, wherever the necessary documents could be exhibited to us; and\r\nwhere they have not been produced we have required satisfactory evidence\r\nof their loss, or of the inability of the claimant to procure\r\nthem.\"[133]\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners conclude their twelfth and last Report in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"Great as is the length of time which hath been consumed in the\r\nprosecution of this inquiry, it may without difficulty be accounted for\r\nby a survey of the multiplicity and complicated nature of the objects to\r\nwhich the Acts of Parliament extended our scrutiny; and when to these\r\nare added the investigation (delegated to us by your lordships) of the\r\nnumerous claims for present relief and temporary support (which alone\r\nformed a heavy branch of business, demanding daily attention), the\r\nseveral reviews and modifications of pension lists, and the various\r\nother extraneous matters which have incidentally devolved upon us, we\r\ntrust we shall, on due consideration of this extensive scene of\r\nemployment, at least stand exculpated by your lordships of inactivity\r\nand unnecessary delay. We have felt with anxious solicitude the urgency\r\nas well as the importance and delicate nature of the trust reposed in\r\nus, and to this impression our exertions towards the speedy, faithful,\r\nand honourable execution of it have been proportioned. We cannot flatter\r\nourselves that no errors have been committed; but we have this\r\nconsolation, that the most assiduous endeavours have not been wanting on\r\nour part to do justice to the individuals and to the public. Supported\r\nby this reflection in our retirement from this arduous and insidious\r\nemployment, we shall feel no inconsiderable satisfaction in having been\r\ninstrumental towards the completion of a work which will ever reflect\r\nhonour on the character of the British nation.\r\n\r\n(Signed)   \"JOHN WILMOT.\r\n\"ROBERT KINGSTON.\r\n\"JOHN MARSH.\r\n\r\n\"Office of American Claims,\r\n\"Lincoln's Inn Fields,\r\n\"May 15th, 1789.\"\r\n\r\nA proper sequel to this whole proceeding will be the following Address\r\nof the Agents for the American Loyalists, presented to the King by Sir\r\nWilliam Pepperell, Bart., and the other agents, being introduced by the\r\nLord of his Majesty's Bedchamber in waiting; which address his Majesty\r\nwas pleased to receive very graciously, and they all had the honour to\r\nkiss his Majesty's hand:\r\n\r\n\"_To the King's Most Excellent Majesty._\r\n\r\n\"The Humble Address of the Agents for the American Loyalists.\r\n\r\n\"Most Gracious Sovereign,--\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty's ever dutiful and loyal subjects, the agents of the\r\nAmerican Loyalists, who have heretofore been the suppliants of your\r\nMajesty in behalf of their distressed constituents, now humbly beg leave\r\nto approach your Throne, to pour forth the ardent effusions of their\r\ngrateful hearts for your most gracious and effectual recommendation of\r\ntheir claims to the just and generous consideration of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"To have devoted their fortunes and hazarded their lives in defence of\r\nthe just rights of the Crown and the fundamental principles of the\r\nBritish Constitution, were no more than their duty demanded of them, in\r\ncommon with your Majesty's other subjects; but it was their peculiar\r\nfortune to be called to the trial, and it is their boast and their glory\r\nto have been found equal to the task.\r\n\r\n\"They have now the distinguished happiness of seeing their fidelity\r\napproved by their Sovereign, and recompensed by Parliament, and their\r\nfellow-subjects cheerfully contributing to compensate them for the\r\nforfeiture their attachment to Great Britain incited them to incur;\r\nthereby adding dignity to their own exalted character among the nations\r\nof the world, and holding out to mankind the glorious principles of\r\njustice, equity, and benevolence as the firmest basis of empire.\r\n\r\n\"We should be wanting in justice and gratitude if we did not upon this\r\noccasion acknowledge the wisdom and liberality of the provisions\r\nproposed by your Majesty's servants, conformable to your Majesty's\r\ngracious intentions for the relief and accommodation of the several\r\nclasses of sufferers to whose cases they apply; and we are convinced it\r\nwill give comfort to your royal heart to be assured they have been\r\nreceived with the most general satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Professions of the unalterable attachment of the Loyalists to your\r\nMajesty's person and government we conceive to be unnecessary; they\r\nhave preserved it under persecution, and gratitude cannot render it less\r\npermanent. They do not presume to arrogate to themselves a more fervent\r\nloyalty than their fellow-subjects possess; but distinguished as they\r\nhave been by their sufferings, they deem themselves entitled to the\r\nforemost rank among the most zealous supporters of the British\r\nConstitution.

This \"caused the\r\nwithdrawal of the claims of their owners (before the English\r\nCommissioners), except that in instances of alleged strip and waste,\r\namercements, and similar losses, inquiries were instituted to ascertain\r\nthe value of what was taken compared with that which was returned.\"\r\n\r\nThe English Commissioners, in their twelfth and last report, remark on\r\nthis subject as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We thought it our duty to state, in our second report of the 24th\r\nDecember, 1784, that the State of South Carolina had, by an Act of the\r\n24th March, 1784, restored the confiscated property of certain\r\nLoyalists, subject to the restrictions therein mentioned; and that in\r\nconsequence thereof many had withdrawn the claims they had before\r\npresented to us. We find, however, that in many instances the parties\r\nhave not been able to reap that advantage they had expected, and which\r\nthe Act above-mentioned held out to them. In some instances the property\r\nrestored has been so wasted and injured as to be of little value; in\r\nothers, the amercements and charges have been nearly equal to the value\r\nof the fee simple of the estates; and in many, where the indents[128]\r\nbeing the species of money received by the State, have been restored to\r\nthe former proprietors, an inevitable and considerable loss has been\r\nsustained by the depreciation. In all these cases we have made minute\r\ninquiry into the real benefit that has been derived from such\r\nrestitution, whether of the property itself, or of the _indents_ in lien\r\nof it; and having endeavoured to ascertain, as nearly as the\r\ncircumstances would admit, the value of what was lost and the value of\r\nwhat was restored, we have considered the difference as the real loss of\r\nthe party.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Indent_--A certificate, or indented certificate, issued\r\nby the Government of the United States at the close of the revolution,\r\nfor the principal or interest of the public debt.--Webster.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: The principle thus laid down was neither just, nor true,\r\nnor generous. The claimants had not asked for _charity_, but for\r\n_compensation_, and that not as a favour, but upon the principles of\r\n\"right and of strict justice.\" The British Ministry and Parliament alone\r\noriginated and were responsible for the policy and measures which had\r\nled to the calamities so ruinous to the Loyalists, who now claimed\r\ncompensation. The claimants had had nothing to do with passing the Stamp\r\nAct; with imposing duties on tea and other articles imported into the\r\ncolonies; with making naval officers collectors of customs; with\r\nerecting courts of admiralty, and depriving the trading colonists of\r\ntrial by jury, and of rendering the officers of the admiralty courts,\r\nand the complainants before them, the recipients of the first\r\nconfiscations imposed by such events; with the acts to close the Port of\r\nBoston, and supersede the chartered constitution of Massachusetts, all\r\nof which, separately and collectively, with other like measures, roused\r\nand united the colonists to resistance, from Maine to Georgia, and in\r\nconsequence of which a majority of the General Congress of the colonists\r\nseized the opportunity to renounce their allegiance to the British\r\nThrone, and to declare their separation from the mother country. And\r\neven after the character of the contest became thus changed from one for\r\nBritish constitutional rights to one for Republican independence, the\r\nLoyalists had nothing to do with the selection of British generals, or\r\nwith their incapacity, their want of tact and energy, their mistakes and\r\nrapacity, together with that of their officers and soldiers, from all\r\nwhich the Loyalists grievously suffered. In the camp, on the march, and\r\nin the field of battle, the Loyalists were always on the alert, and\r\nperformed the severest and most perilous services. No class of men had\r\nstronger claims on the nation, upon the principles of right and strict\r\njustice, than the Loyalist claimants before Parliament. This was\r\nacknowledged by all the speakers on both sides, and in both Houses of\r\nParliament, and even by Mr. Pitt himself, and the objectionable and\r\noffensive principle which he laid down at the outset was contravened by\r\nthe whole tenor and spirit of his speech.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: The number of claims examined by the Commissioners in\r\nNova Scotia and Canada was 1,272; the amount of claims was £975,310; the\r\nlosses allowed were £336,753.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: What remained for consideration, and which was afterwards\r\ngranted by Parliament, consisted of seven Articles, and was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1.

Claims of creditors on ceded lands in Georgia                 45,885\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: The case of such merchants was peculiarly distressing. In\r\nthe \"Historical Review of the Commission,\" the Commissioners state:\r\n\r\n\"The claims for debts due from subjects of the United States, as well\r\nfrom the magnitude of their amount as the peculiar hardship and\r\ninjustice under which the claimants labour respecting them, form a\r\nsubject which appears strongly to press for the attention and\r\ninterposition of Government. The Treaty of Peace having provided that\r\n'Creditors on either side should meet with no lawful impediment to the\r\nrecovery of the full value of their debts in sterling money,' losses of\r\nthis nature have not been considered as within the inquiry directed by\r\nthe Act, because we cannot consider any right or property as lost to the\r\nparty where the Government of the country has expressly provided and\r\nstipulated for a remedy by a public treaty. We think it, however,\r\nincumbent upon us to represent that the claimants uniformly state to us\r\nthe insuperable difficulties they find themselves under, as individuals,\r\nin seeking the recovery of their debts according to the provision of the\r\ntreaty, whilst themselves are the objects of prosecution in courts of\r\njustice here for debts due to the subjects of the United States. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, the situation of this class of sufferers appears to\r\nbe singularly distressing--disabled on the one hand by the laws or\r\npractice of the several States from recovering the debts due them, yet\r\ncompellable on the other to pay all demands against them; and though the\r\nstipulation in the treaty in their favour has proved of no avail to\r\nprocure them the redress it holds out in one country, yet they find\r\nthemselves excluded by it from all claims to relief in the other.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: It is certain that but a small proportion of the American\r\nLoyalists presented claims before the Parliamentary Commissioners in\r\nEngland for compensation for services or loss of property; and many of\r\nthose who presented claims did not prosecute them. The Commissioners\r\ngive the following explanation on this point:\r\n\r\n\"It may, perhaps, appear singular that so many claims presented, viz.,\r\n448, have been withdrawn; but it may be owing, in the first place, to\r\nthe circumstance of many of these claimants having recovered possession\r\nof their estates, and, in the next place, to the uncertainty, at the\r\ncommencement of the inquiry, as to the nature of the Commission, and the\r\nspecies of loss which was the object of it, and perhaps to the\r\nconsciousness of others that they were not able to establish the claims\r\nthey had presented.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE LOYALISTS DRIVEN FROM THE UNITED STATES TO THE BRITISH PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Loyalists, after having been stripped of their rights and property\r\nduring the war, and driven from their homes, and hunted and killed at\r\npleasure, were exiled from all right of residence and citizenship at the\r\nclose of the war; and though the Treaty of Peace engaged that Congress\r\nshould recommend the several States to compensate them for the losses of\r\ntheir property, the Legislatures of the several States (with one\r\nexception) refused any compliance with this stipulation of the national\r\ntreaty; and the Legislature of New York actually ordered the punishment\r\nof those Loyalists who applied for compensation. At the close of the\r\nwar, therefore, instead of witnessing, as in the case of all other\r\ncivilized nations at the termination of a civil war, however rancorous\r\nand cruel, a general amnesty and the restoration of all parties to the\r\nrights and property which they enjoyed at the commencement of the\r\nstrife, the Loyalists found themselves exiled and impoverished, and\r\ntheir enemies in possession of their homes and domains. It is true about\r\n3,000 of the Loyalists were able to employ agents, or appear personally,\r\nto apply to the English Government and Parliament for compensation for\r\ntheir losses; and the preceding chapter records the noble appreciation\r\nof their character and services by British statesmen, and the liberality\r\nof Parliament in making them compensation for their losses and\r\nsufferings in maintaining their fidelity to the mother country. But\r\nthese 3,000 constituted not one-tenth of the Loyalists who had suffered\r\nlosses and hardships during the civil war; upwards of 30,000 of them\r\nwere driven from the homes of their birth, and of their forefathers, to\r\nwildernesses of everlasting snow. It was a policy as inhuman and\r\nimpolitic as that of Spain in expelling upwards of 600,000 Moors, the\r\nmost skilful and profitable of their manufacturers and artizans; or of\r\nFrance, in compelling the escape of above 500,000 of the best workers in\r\nthe finest manufactures to other countries where they laid the\r\nfoundation of industries which have proved a source of boundless wealth\r\nto England at the expense of the commerce and manufactures of France.\r\nThe Democrats were then the ruling party in most of the States; the more\r\nmoderate voice and liberal policy of the Conservative Republicans were\r\nhushed and fanned down by the Democratic leaders, who seemed unable to\r\nlook beyond the gratification of their resentment and avarice; they\r\nseemed to fear the residence and presence of men of intelligence,\r\nability, and energy, who might in the future rival if not eclipse them.\r\nThe maxim of the Loyalists was, obedience to law; heretofore they looked\r\nupon the enactments of the States and of Congress as usurpation; those\r\nenactments were now recognized as law by England herself, in the\r\nacknowledgment of American Independence; and the Loyalists would have\r\nbeen among the most obedient and law-abiding citizens had they been\r\nallowed to remain in the land of their nativity and forefathers, and\r\nwould have largely added to its social advancement, literature, and\r\nwealth, and would undoubtedly, before now, have led to the unity of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race under one free and progressive government. Historians\r\nand statesmen have long since condemned this resentful and narrow-minded\r\npolicy of the States against the Loyalists after the close of the\r\nrevolutionary war, as do now even American historians.[134]\r\n\r\nThe Americans inaugurated their Declaration of Independence by enacting\r\nthat all adherents to connection with the mother country were rebels and\r\ntraitors; they followed the recognition of Independence by England by\r\nexiling such adherents from their territories. But while this wretched\r\npolicy depleted the United States of some of their best blood, it laid\r\nthe foundation of the settlement and institutions of the then almost\r\nunknown and wilderness provinces which have since become the\r\nwide-spread, free and prosperous Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nUntil very recently, the early history of the Loyalists of America has\r\nnever been written, except to blacken their character and misrepresent\r\ntheir actions; they were represented as a set of idle office-seekers--an\r\nimputation which has been amply refuted by their braving the forests of\r\nnorthern countries, and converting them into fruitful fields, developing\r\ntrade and commerce, and establishing civil, religious, and educational\r\ninstitutions that are an honour to America itself. Yet, when exiled from\r\ntheir native land, they were bereft of the materials of their true\r\nhistory. A living American writer truly observes:\r\n\r\n\"Of the reasons which influenced, of the hopes and fears which agitated,\r\nand of the miseries and rewards which awaited the Loyalists--or, as they\r\nwere called in the politics of the time, the Tories--of the American\r\nRevolution, but little is known. The most intelligent, the best informed\r\namong us, confess the deficiency of their knowledge. The reason is\r\nobvious. Men who, like the Loyalists, separate themselves from their\r\nfriends and kindred, who are driven from their homes, who surrender the\r\nhopes and expectations of life, and who become outlaws, wanderers, and\r\nexiles--such men leave few memorials behind them. Their papers are\r\nscattered and lost, and their very names pass from human recollection.\r\n* * Of several of the Loyalists who were high in office, of others who\r\nwere men of talents and acquirements, and of still others who were of\r\nless consideration, I have been able, after long and extensive\r\nresearches, to learn scarcely more than their names, or the single fact\r\nthat for their political opinions or offences they were proscribed and\r\nbanished.\"[135]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which the Loyalists were banished from the\r\nStates and deprived of their property will largely account for the\r\nalienation of feeling which long existed between the Americans and\r\nCanadians, which gave intensity to the war of 1812-15, which exists to\r\nsome extent at this day, but which is gradually subsiding, and is being\r\ngradually superseded by feelings of mutual respect and friendship,\r\nstrengthened by large commercial and social relations, including many\r\nintermarriages.\r\n\r\nTo understand the sacrifices which the Loyalists made, and the courage\r\nand energy they evinced, in leaving their old homes and associations in\r\nthe sunny parts of America, and in seeking a refuge and a home in the\r\nwilds of the remaining British Provinces, it will be necessary to notice\r\nwhat was then known, and the impression then existing, as to the\r\nclimate, productions, and conditions of these provinces.[136]\r\n\r\nAt that time New Brunswick formed a part of Nova Scotia, and was not\r\norganized into a separate province until 1784. The impressions then\r\nentertained as to the climate of Nova Scotia (including New Brunswick)\r\nmay be inferred from the following extracts from a pamphlet published in\r\nEngland in 1784:\r\n\r\n\"It has a winter of almost insufferable length and coldness; * * there\r\nare but a few inconsiderable spots fit to cultivate, and the land is\r\ncovered with a cold spongy moss in place of grass. * * Winter continues\r\nat least seven months in the year; the country is wrapt in the gloom of\r\na perpetual fog; the mountains run down to the sea coast, and leave but\r\nhere and there a spot to inhabit.\" Some of the officers, embarking at\r\nNew York for Nova Scotia, are said to have remarked that they were\r\n\"bound for a country where there were nine months of winter and three\r\nmonths of cold weather every year.\" Lower Canada was known as a region\r\nof deep snow, intense cold, and little fertility; a colony of the\r\nFrench; its capital, Quebec, the scene of decisive battles between the\r\nEnglish and French under Wolfe and Montcalm, and afterwards between\r\nMurray and Montgomery, the latter the leader of the American revolters\r\nand invaders. Montreal was regarded as the place of transit of the fur\r\ntrade from the Hudson's Bay Company to England.\r\n\r\nUpper Canada was then unknown, or known only as a region of dense\r\nwilderness and swamps, of venomous reptiles and beasts of prey, the\r\nhunting grounds and encampments of numerous Indian tribes, intense cold\r\nof winter, and with no other redeeming feature except abundance of game\r\nand fish.[137]\r\n\r\nThe entire ignorance of the climate of Upper Canada which prevailed at\r\nthe close of the revolutionary war, may be inferred from the facts\r\nstated in a succeeding chapter, when the British commander of New York,\r\nbeing unable to transport any more Loyalists to Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick, sent for a Mr. Grass, who had been a prisoner during the\r\nFrench war for two or three years at Kingston, then Frontenac, to\r\ninquire of him what sort of a country Upper Canada was, and whether\r\npeople could live there. Grass replied that he thought Upper Canada was\r\na good country, and that people could live there. The British commander\r\nexpressed much joy at the reply, and asked Mr. Grass if he would\r\nundertake to conduct a colony of Loyalists to Canada; the vessels,\r\nprovisions, etc., would be furnished for that purpose. Mr. Grass asked\r\nthree days to consider the proposal, and at length consented to\r\nundertake the task. It appears that five vessels were procured and\r\nfurnished to convey this first colony of banished refugee Loyalists to\r\nUpper Canada; they sailed around the coast of New Brunswick and Nova\r\nScotia, and up the St. Lawrence to Sorel, where they arrived in October,\r\n1783, and where they built themselves huts or shanties and wintered; and\r\nin May, 1784, they prosecuted their voyage in boats, and reached their\r\ndestination, Cataraqui, afterwards Kingston, in July. The manner of\r\ntheir settlement and providing for their subsistence is described in a\r\nsucceeding chapter.\r\n\r\nOther bands of Loyalists made their way to Canada by land; some by the\r\nmilitary highway to Lower Canada, Whitehall, Lake Champlain,\r\nTiconderoga, Plattsburg, and then turning northward proceeded to\r\nCornwall; then ascending the St. Lawrence, along the north side of which\r\nmany of them settled. This Champlain route was the common one to Lower\r\nCanada, descending the River Richelieu from St. John's to Sorel.\r\n\r\nBut the most common land route from New York to Upper Canada, chosen by\r\nthe Loyalists at the close of the war, was to Albany 180 miles up the\r\nHudson river, which divides into two branches about ten miles north of\r\nAlbany. The western branch is called the Mohawk, leading to Rome,\r\nformerly Fort Stanwix. A branch of the Mohawk, called Wood Creek, leads\r\ntowards the Oneida lake, which was reached by a portage. From Oneida\r\nLake, Lake Ontario was reached by the Oswego river. Flat-bottom boats,\r\nspecially built or purchased for the purpose by the Loyalists, were used\r\nin this journey. The portages over which the boats had to be hauled, and\r\nall their contents carried, are stated to be thirty miles. On reaching\r\nOswego, some of the Loyalists coasted along the eastern shore of Lake\r\nOntario to Kingston, and thence up the Bay of Quinté; others went\r\nwestward, along the south shore of the lake to Niagara and Queenston;\r\nsome pursued their course to the head of the lake at Burlington; others\r\nmade their way up the Niagara river to Queenston, conveyed their boats\r\nover the portage of ten or twelve miles to Chippewa, thence up the river\r\nand into Lake Erie, settling chiefly in what was called the \"Long Point\r\nCountry,\" now the county of Norfolk. This journey of hardship,\r\nprivation, and exposure occupied from two to three months. The parents\r\nand family of the writer of this history were from the middle of May to\r\nthe middle of July, 1799, in making this journey in an open boat.\r\nGenerally two or more families would unite in one company, and thus\r\nassist each other in carrying their boats and goods over the portages.\r\n\r\nA considerable number came to Canada from New Jersey and the\r\nneighbourhood of Philadelphia on foot through the then wilderness of New\r\nYork, carrying their little effects and small children on pack horses,\r\nand driving their cattle, which subsisted on herbage of the woods and\r\nvalleys. Some of the families of this class testified to the relief and\r\nkindness they received in their extreme exigencies from the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe hardships, exposures, privations and sufferings which the first\r\nLoyalists endured in making their way from their confiscated homes to\r\nCanada, were longer and more severe than anything narrated of the\r\nPilgrim and Puritan Fathers of New England in their voyages from England\r\nto Massachusetts Bay; and the persecutions to which the emigration of\r\nthe Puritans from England is attributed were trifling indeed in\r\ncomparison of the persecutions, imprisonments, confiscations, and often\r\ndeath, inflicted on the loyal adherents to the Crown of England in the\r\nUnited States, and which drove the survivors among them to the\r\nwilderness of Canada. The privations and hardships experienced by many\r\nof these Loyalist patriots for years after the first settlement in\r\nCanada, as testified by the papers in the subsequent chapter, were much\r\nmore severe than anything experienced by the Pilgrim Fathers during the\r\nfirst years of their settlement in Massachusetts. These latter could\r\nkeep a \"Harvest Home\" festival of a week, at the end of the first year\r\nafter their landing in the Bay of Massachusetts; but it was years after\r\ntheir arrival in Canada before the Loyalists could command means to keep\r\nany such festival. The stern adherence of the Puritans to their\r\nprinciples was quite equalled by the stern adherence of the Loyalists to\r\ntheir principles, and far excelled by their sacrifices and sufferings.\r\n\r\nCanada has a noble parentage, the remembrance of which its inhabitants\r\nmay well cherish with respect, affection, and pride.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: \"Had we pursued a wise course, people of our own stock\r\nwould not have become our rivals in ship-building, in the carriage of\r\nour great staples, in the prosecution of the fisheries, and in the\r\nproduction of wheat and other breadstuffs. Nor is this all: we should\r\nnot have had the hatred, the influence and the talents of persons of\r\nLoyalist origin to contend against in the questions which have and may\r\nyet come up between us and England.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, as it seems to me, humanity to the adherents of the Crown, and\r\nprudent regard for our own interests, required a general amnesty; as it\r\nwas, we not only dealt harshly with many, and unjustly with some, but\r\ndoomed to misery others, whose hearts and hopes had been as true as\r\nthose of Washington himself. Thus in the divisions of families which\r\neverywhere occurred, and which formed one of the most distressing\r\ncircumstances of the conflict, there were wives and daughters, who,\r\nalthough bound to Loyalists by the holiest ties, had given their\r\nsympathies to the right from the beginning, and who now, in the triumph\r\nof the cause which had their prayers, went meekly--as woman ever meets a\r\nsorrowful lot--into hopeless, interminable exile.\" (Introductory\r\nHistorical Essay to Sabine's Sketches of the Loyalists of the American\r\nRevolution, pp. 90, 91.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Preface to Colonel Sabine's Biographical Sketches of the\r\nAmerican Loyalists, or Adherents to the British Crown, in the War of the\r\nRevolution.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: The Loyalists who were attached to military corps raised\r\nin the extreme South were principally of the Southern States, and a\r\nlarge portion of them settled in the Bahamas, Florida, and the British\r\nWest Indies. \"Some of the officers who belonged to the 'Maryland\r\nLoyalists,' and some of the privates of that corps, embarked for Nova\r\nScotia, but were wrecked in the Bay of Fundy, and a part perished.\"\r\n(Sabine.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: \"The western part of Canada, abandoned after the conquest\r\n_as an Indian hunting ground_, or occupied at its western extremity on\r\nLake Erie by a few of the ancient French colonists, began now to assume\r\nimportance, and its capability of supporting a numerous population along\r\nthe Great River and the lakes became evident. Those excellent men, who,\r\npreferring to sacrifice life and fortune rather than forego the enviable\r\ndistinction of being British subjects, saw that this vast field afforded\r\na sure and certain mode of safety and of honourable retreat, and\r\naccordingly, in 1783, ten thousand (10,000) were enumerated in that\r\nportion of Canada, who, under the proud title of United Empire\r\nLoyalists, had turned their backs for ever upon the new-fangled\r\nrepublicanism and treason of the country of their birth.\r\n\r\n\"The obstacles, privations, and miseries these people had to encounter\r\nmay readily be imagined in a country where the primeval forest covered\r\nthe earth, and where the only path was the river or the lake. They\r\nultimately were, however, blessed with success; and to this day the\r\noriginal letters U.E., after the name of an applicant for land, ensure\r\nits grant.\" (Sir Richard Bonnycastle's Canada Before 1837, Vol. I., pp.\r\n24, 25.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nBRIEF SKETCHES OF SOME INDIVIDUAL LOYALISTS--FIRST SETTLERS IN CANADA\r\nAND OTHER BRITISH PROVINCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to give biographical sketches of all the old\r\nLoyalists, officers and soldiers. To do justice to their character and\r\nmerits would require a massive volume. Besides, the data for such a\r\nvolume are for the most part wanting. It is not the object of this\r\nhistory to give a biography of the Loyalists; that must be done by\r\nothers, if attempted at all. The Loyalists were not writers, but\r\nworkers. Almost the only history of them has been written by their\r\nenemies, whose object was to conceal the treatment they received, to\r\ndepreciate their merits and defame their character, for the vindication\r\nof which it is only of late years that materials have been procured. It\r\nis the object of this history to vindicate their character as a body, to\r\nexhibit their principles and patriotism, and to illustrate their\r\ntreatment and sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe best, and indeed only biography of the Loyalists extant is Sabine's\r\n\"_American Loyalists, or Biographical Sketches of Adherents to the\r\nBritish Crown in the War of the Revolution_,\"--especially the first, not\r\nthe second edition. The author has more than once quoted the excellent\r\nhistorical essay introductory to the sketches of this work, and from\r\nwhich Dr. Canniff has enriched the pages of his valuable \"_History of\r\nthe Settlement of Upper Canada, with special reference to the Bay of\r\nQuinté_.\" From these sources we will condense brief notices of some of\r\nthe early Loyalists, preliminary to the information in regard to others\r\nfurnished us in the interesting letters and papers which follow. These\r\nnotices will further illustrate the character and sacrifices of the\r\nLoyalist combatants--the treatment they received and the courage they\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\n1. _Samuel Anderson_, of New York, entered the service of the Crown, and\r\nwas a captain in the regiment of Sir John Johnson. In 1783 he settled\r\nnear Cornwall, Upper Canada, and received half-pay; held several civil\r\noffices, such as those of Magistrate, Judge of the District Court,\r\nAssociate Justice of King's Bench, etc. He continued to reside on his\r\nproperty near Cornwall until his decease in 1836, at the age of one\r\nhundred and one. His property in New York was abandoned and lost.\r\n\r\n2. _Rev. John Bethune_ (father of the late Bishop of Toronto), of North\r\nCarolina, was chaplain to the Loyal Militia; was taken prisoner at the\r\nbattle of Cross Creek; was confined in jail, first at Halifax and\r\nfinally in Philadelphia. After his release, his continued loyalty\r\nreduced him to great distress. He was appointed to the 84th Regiment and\r\nrestored to comfort. At the peace, he settled in Upper Canada, at\r\nWilliamston, near Cornwall, and died in 1815, at the age of sixty-five.\r\n\r\n3. _Doane_, of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Of this family there were\r\nfive brothers--Moses, Joseph, Israel, Abraham, and Mahlon. They were men\r\nof fine figure and address, elegant horsemen, great runners and leapers,\r\nand excellent at stratagems and escapes. Their father was respectable,\r\nand possessed a good estate. The sons themselves, prior to the war, were\r\nmen of reputation and proposed to remain neutral; but harassed\r\npersonally, their property sold by the Whigs, because they would not\r\nsubmit to the exactions of the time, they determined to avenge\r\nthemselves by a predatory warfare upon their persecutors, and to live in\r\nthe open air as best they could. They became the terror of the\r\nsurrounding country; they spared the weak, the poor, and the peaceful;\r\nthey aimed at public property and at public men. Generally their\r\nexpeditions were on horseback. Sometimes the five went together; at\r\nother times separately, with accomplices. Whoever of them was\r\napprehended, broke jail; whoever of them was assailed, escaped. In a\r\nword, such was their course, that a reward of £300 was offered for the\r\nhead of each. Ultimately, three were slain; Moses, after a desperate\r\nfight, was shot by his captor; and Abraham and Mahlon were living at\r\nPhiladelphia. Joseph, before the revolution, taught school. During the\r\nwar, while on a marauding expedition, he was shot through the cheeks,\r\nand was taken prisoner. He was committed to await his trial, but escaped\r\nto New Jersey. A reward of $800 was offered for his apprehension, but\r\nwithout success. He resumed his former employment in New Jersey and\r\nlived there under an assumed name for nearly a year, but finally fled to\r\nCanada. The only mention of Israel is that \"in February, 1783, he\r\nappealed to the Council of Pennsylvania to be released on account of his\r\nown sufferings and the destitute condition of his family, and that his\r\npetition was dismissed.\"\r\n\r\n4. _Stephen Jarvis_, in 1782 was a lieutenant of cavalry in the South\r\nCarolina Royalists; was in several battles; was in New Brunswick; after\r\nthe revolution came to Upper Canada, and died at Toronto in 1840, aged\r\neighty-four.\r\n\r\n5. _William Jarvis_ was an officer of cavalry in the Queen's Rangers;\r\nwas wounded at the siege of Yorktown. At the Peace he settled in Upper\r\nCanada, became Secretary of the Province, and died at York (Toronto) in\r\n1817.\r\n\r\n6. _David Jones_ was captain in the royal service, and the reputed\r\nspouse or husband of the \"beautiful and good Jane McCrea,\" whose cruel\r\ndeath in 1777, by the Indians, on her way to join him, is so universally\r\nknown and lamented. He lived in Canada to an old age, but never married.\r\nJane McCrea was the daughter of the Rev. James McCrea, a Loyalist.\r\n\r\n7. _Jonathan Jones_, of New York, was brother of Captain David Jones,\r\nand assisted in the latter part of 1776 in raising a company in Lower\r\nCanada, and joined the British garrison at Crown Point. Later in the war\r\nhe was captain under General Frazer.\r\n\r\n8. _Captain Richard Lippincott_ was born in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, on\r\nthe 2nd of January, 1745. He was descended from an old colonial family,\r\nand served during the revolution as a captain in the New Jersey\r\nvolunteers. He was married on the 4th of March, 1770, to Esther Borden,\r\ndaughter of Jeremiah and Esther Borden, of Bordentown, New Jersey. On\r\nthe outbreak of the revolution he warmly espoused the side of the Crown,\r\nand was early in the war captured and confined in Burlington jail, from\r\nwhich he escaped in the year 1776, and made his way to the British army\r\nat Staten Island. During the remainder of the war he served with his\r\nregiment. His connection with the execution of Captain Joshua Huddy, of\r\nthe rebel service, attracted a great deal of attention both in Europe\r\nand America. Captain Huddy was a partisan officer of some repute in New\r\nJersey, and had been concerned in the murder of a Loyalist named Philip\r\nWhite, who was a relative of Lippincott, and a resident of Shrewsbury.\r\nOne Edwards of the same neighbourhood had also been put to death about\r\nthe same time. Shortly after, Captain Huddy was captured and taken as\r\nprisoner to New York. The \"Board of Associated Loyalists of New York\"\r\nsent Captain Lippincott to Middleton Point, or Sandy Hook, with Captain\r\nHuddy and two other prisoners, to exchange them for prisoners held by\r\nthe rebels. He was authorized to execute Huddy in retaliation for White,\r\nwho had already been put to death. Therefore, on the 12th of April,\r\n1782, having exchanged the two other prisoners, Captain Lippincott hung\r\nHuddy on a tree by the beach, under the Middleton Heights. In 1867 the\r\ntree was still to be seen, and tradition keeps alive in the\r\nneighbourhood the story connected with it. Captain Lippincott, who was\r\nevidently only obeying orders, pinned a paper on Huddy's breast with the\r\nfollowing inscription:\r\n\r\n\"We, the Refugees, having long with grief beheld the cruel murders of\r\nour brethren, and finding nothing but such measures carrying into\r\nexecution,--we therefore determine not to suffer without taking\r\nvengeance for the numerous cruelties, and thus begin, having made use of\r\nCaptain Huddy as the first object to present to your view, and further\r\ndetermine to hang man for man while there is a refugee existing.\r\n\r\n\"UP GOES HUDDY FOR PHILIP WHITE.\"\r\n\r\nWashington, upon hearing of Huddy's death, demanded the surrender of\r\nCaptain Lippincott from the Royalist authorities, in order that he might\r\nbe put to death. This demand was refused, and Washington then ordered\r\nthe execution of one officer of equal rank to be chosen by lot from\r\namong the prisoners in his hands. The lot fell upon Captain Asgill, of\r\nthe Guards, who was only nineteen years of age. The British authorities\r\nsecured a respite under promise of trying Captain Lippincott by\r\ncourt-martial. After a full inquiry, Lippincott was honourably\r\nacquitted. In the meantime, Lady Asgill, Captain Asgill's mother,\r\nappealed to the Count de Vergennes, the French Minister, and, in\r\nresponse to her most pathetic appeal, the Count was instructed by the\r\nKing and Queen of France, in their joint names, to ask of Washington the\r\nrelease of Captain Asgill \"as a tribute to humanity.\" Washington, after\r\na long delay, granted this request, but Asgill and Lippincott were not\r\nset at liberty till the close of the war. Asgill lived to become a\r\ngeneral, and to succeed to his father's baronetcy.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Captain Lippincott moved to New Brunswick, to a place\r\ncalled Pennfield, where he lived till the fall of 1787, when he went to\r\nEngland, where he remained till the end of 1788. He was granted half pay\r\nas a captain of the British army, and in 1793 he moved from New\r\nBrunswick to Canada, when he was granted for his U.E. Loyalist services\r\n3,000 acres of land in the township of Vaughan, near Toronto.\r\n\r\nHe lived near Richmond Hill for many years. His only surviving child,\r\nEsther Borden Lippincott, was married in 1806 to the late Colonel George\r\nTaylor Denison, of Bellevue, Toronto, at whose house Captain Lippincott\r\ndied in 1826, aged eighty-one years. The family of Denisons of Toronto\r\nare all descendants of Captain Lippincott through this marriage.\r\n\r\n9. _McDonald._--There were many of this name who took part with the\r\nloyal combatants, and of whom several settled in Canada.\r\n\r\nAlexander McDonald was a major in a North Carolina regiment, and was the\r\nhusband of the celebrated Flora McDonald, who was so true and devoted to\r\nPrince Charles Edward, the last of the Stuarts who sought the throne of\r\nEngland. They had emigrated to North Carolina; and when the revolution\r\nbroke out, he, with two sons, took up arms for the Crown. Those who\r\nsettled in Canada were Donald McDonald, of New York, who served under\r\nSir John Johnson for seven years, and died at Wolfe Island, Upper\r\nCanada, aged 97; and Allan McDonald, of Tryon (afterwards Montgomery),\r\nNew York, who was associated with Sir John Johnson in 1776, and died at\r\na great age, at Three Rivers, in Lower Canada, 1822.\r\n\r\n10. _John McGill_ was, in 1782, an officer of infantry in the Queen's\r\nRangers, and at the close of the war went to New Brunswick; removed\r\nthence to Upper Canada, became a man of note and member of the\r\nLegislative Council, and died at Toronto, in 1834, at the age of\r\neighty-three.\r\n\r\n11. _Donald McGillis_ resided at the beginning of the revolution on the\r\nMohawk river, New York. Embracing the royal side in the contest, he\r\nformed one of a \"determined band of young men,\" who attacked a Whig\r\npost, and, in the face of a superior force, cut down the flag-staff and\r\ntore in strips the stars and stripes attached to it. Subsequently he\r\njoined a grenadier company called the Royal Yorkers, and performed\r\nefficient service throughout the war. At the peace he settled in Canada;\r\nand entering the British service again in 1812, was appointed captain in\r\nthe colonial corps by Sir Isaac Brock. He died at River Raisin, Canada,\r\nin 1844, aged eighty years.\r\n\r\n12. _Thomas Merrit_, of New York (father of the late Hon. W. Hamilton\r\nMerrit), was in 1782 cornet of cavalry in the Queen's Rangers. He\r\nsettled in Upper Canada, and held the office of high sheriff of the\r\nNiagara district. He died at St. Catharines, May, 1842, at the age of\r\neighty years.\r\n\r\n_The Robinson family_ was one of the distinguished families in America\r\nbefore, during, and after the revolution, and its members have filled\r\nsome of the most important offices in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New\r\nBrunswick, Lower and Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n13. _Beverley Robinson_, of New York, was the son of the Honourable John\r\nRobinson, of Virginia, who was President of that colony on the\r\nretirement of Governor Gooch. He removed to New York, and married\r\nSusanna, daughter of Frederick Phillipse, Esquire, who owned an immense\r\nlanded estate on the Hudson river. By this connection Mr. Robinson added\r\ngreatly to his wealth and became very rich. When the revolutionary\r\ncontroversy commenced, he was living on that portion of the Phillipse\r\nestate which had been given to his wife, and there he desired to remain\r\nin the quiet enjoyment of country life, and in the enjoyment of his\r\nlarge domains. That such was his inclination is asserted by the late\r\nPresident Dwight, and is fully continued by circumstances and by his\r\ndescendants. He _was opposed to the measures of the British Ministry,\r\ngave up the use of imported merchandize, and clothed himself and family\r\nin fabrics of domestic manufacture_.\r\n\r\n_But he was opposed to the separation of the colonies from the mother\r\ncountry._ Still he wished to take no part in the conflict of arms. The\r\nimportunity of friends overruled his own judgment, and he entered the\r\nmilitary service of the Crown. Of the Loyal American Regiment, raised\r\nprincipally in New York by himself, he was commissioned the colonel. He\r\nalso commanded the corps called Guides and Pioneers. Of the former, or\r\nthe Loyal Americans, his son Beverley was lieutenant-colonel, and Thomas\r\nBarclay, major. He and Washington had been personal friends until\r\npolitical events produced separation between them.\r\n\r\nAt the peace, Colonel Robinson, with a part of his family, went to\r\nEngland. His name appears as a member of the first Council of New\r\nBrunswick; but he never took his seat at the Board. His wife, with\r\nhimself, was attainted for high treason; in order to secure her property\r\nto the Americans, she was included in the Confiscation Act of New York,\r\nand the whole of the estate derived from her father passed from the\r\nfamily. The value of her interest may be estimated from the fact that\r\nthe British Government granted her and her husband the sum of £17,000\r\nsterling, which, though equal to $80,000, _was considered only a partial\r\ncompensation_.\r\n\r\nColonel Robinson has highly respectable descendants in New Brunswick as\r\nwell as in Canada. William Henry, who was afterwards King William the\r\nFourth, enjoyed Colonel Robinson's hospitality in New York at a later\r\ndate. The Robinsons were unquestionably immediate sufferers from the\r\nevents which drove them into exile. But though Colonel Robinson was not\r\namply compensated in money by the Government for which he sacrificed\r\nfortune, home, and his native land, yet the distinction obtained by his\r\nchildren and grand-children in the colonies, though deprived of their\r\ninheritance, has not been without other and substantial recompense, as\r\nno persons of the Loyalist descent have been more favoured in official\r\nstations and powerful family alliances than the heirs of the daughters\r\nof Frederick Phillipse, Susanna Robinson, and Mary Morris (see under the\r\nnames of Colonel Roger Morris and Colonel Thomas Barclay).\r\n\r\n14. _Beverley Robinson (jun.)_ was son of Colonel Beverley Robinson, and\r\nlieutenant-colonel in the Loyal American Regiment, commanded by his\r\nfather; was a graduate of Columbia College, New York, and at the\r\ncommencement of the revolutionary troubles was a student of law in the\r\noffice of James Duane. His wife, Nancy, whom he married during the war,\r\nwas daughter of the Reverend Henry Barclay, D.D., rector of Trinity\r\nChurch, New York, and sister of Colonel Thomas Barclay. At the\r\nevacuation of New York, Lieutenant-Colonel Robinson was placed at the\r\nhead of a large number of Loyalists who embarked for Shelburne, Nova\r\nScotia, and who laid out that place in a very handsome manner, in the\r\nhope of its becoming a town of business and importance. The harbour of\r\nShelburne is represented to be one of the best in North America; the\r\npopulation rapidly increased to about 12,000 persons, but soon as\r\nrapidly declined, being outrivalled by Halifax--and many abandoned\r\nShelburne for other parts of the British provinces. Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nRobinson went to New Brunswick, and resided near the city of St. John.\r\nHis deprivations and sufferings for a considerable time after leaving\r\nNew York were great, but were finally relieved by the receipt of\r\nhalf-pay as an officer in the service of the Crown. In New Brunswick he\r\nwas a member of his Majesty's Council; and at the period of the French\r\nrevolution, and on the occurrence of the Napoleonic war between England\r\nand France, he was entrusted with the command of the regiment raised in\r\nthat colony, possessed great energy, and contributed much by his\r\nexertions and influence to settle and advance the commercial emporium of\r\nNew Brunswick. In the Confiscation Act of New York, by which his estate\r\nwas taken from him, he was styled \"Beverley Robinson the younger.\" He\r\ndied in 1816, at New York, while on a visit to two of his sons who were\r\nresiding in that city.\r\n\r\n15. _Christopher Robinson_, of Virginia, was kinsman of Colonel Beverley\r\nRobinson; entered William and Mary College with his cousin Robert,\r\nescaped with him to New York, and received a commission in the Loyal\r\nCanadian Regiment; served at the South, and was wounded. At the peace he\r\nwent first to New Brunswick, and then to Nova Scotia, receiving a grant\r\nof land in each province. He soon removed to Upper Canada, where\r\nGovernor Simcoe gave him the appointment of Deputy-Surveyor-General of\r\nCrown Lands. His salary, half pay, and an estate of 2,000 acres, placed\r\nhim in comfortable circumstances.\r\n\r\n16. _Sir John Beverley Robinson_ was a son of Christopher Robinson, of\r\nVirginia; received his early legal education in England, and was\r\nadmitted to the English bar. He returned to Upper Canada while yet\r\nyoung; served with distinction in the war of 1812, and was in several\r\nbattles. He was early appointed Attorney-General, and held a seat in the\r\nHouse of Assembly for ten years; after which he was appointed Member and\r\nSpeaker of the Legislative Council. During the insurrection of 1837, in\r\nUpper Canada, he took his musket and went into the ranks, accompanied by\r\nhis two sons. He was born in 1791; was appointed Attorney-General of\r\nUpper Canada in 1818; was raised to the Bench as Chief Justice in 1829;\r\nwas created Baronet in 1854; and died in 1863, aged seventy-two.\r\n\r\n17. _Sir Charles Frederick Phillipse Robinson_, G.C.B., of New York, was\r\nthe son of Colonel Beverley Robinson; entered the King's service early\r\nin the Revolution, and at the peace returned with his father to England,\r\nwhere he was continued in the British army; became Lieutenant-General,\r\nand received the honour of knighthood. He was with the Duke of\r\nWellington, and saw much hard service. At the storming of St. Sebastian\r\nhe was dangerously wounded. He was in the battle of Vittoria, Nive,\r\nOrthes, and Toulouse. During the war of 1812 he came to America, and was\r\nemployed in Canada. He commanded the British force in the attack on\r\nPlattsburg, under Prevost, and protested against the order of his\r\nsuperior, when directed to retire, because from the position of his\r\ntroops he was of opinion that his loss of men would be greater in\r\nretreat than in advance upon the American works. After the conclusion of\r\nhostilities he embarked at New York for England.\r\n\r\n18. _Morris Robinson_, of New York, was also son of Colonel Beverley\r\nRobinson, and was captain of the Queen's Rangers. When that corps was\r\ndisbanded at the close of the war, most of the officers were dismissed\r\non half pay, and settled in New Brunswick; but Captain Robinson, by good\r\nfortune, was continued in commission, and at the time of his decease he\r\nwas lieutenant-colonel, and assistant-barrackmaster-general in the\r\nBritish army. He had three sons officers in the British army, and two\r\ndaughters, Susan and Joane; the former became the wife of Robert Parker,\r\njudge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick; and the latter the wife of\r\nRobert T. Hagien, Esq., barrister-at-law, master in chancery, and\r\nformerly mayor of the city of St. John.\r\n\r\n19. _John Robinson_, of New York, likewise a son of Colonel Beverley\r\nRobinson, was during the revolution a lieutenant of the Loyal American\r\nRegiment, commanded by his father; and when the corps was disbanded at\r\nthe close of the war, he settled in New Brunswick, and received half\r\npay. He embarked, and successfully, in mercantile pursuits, and held\r\ndistinguished public stations, being deputy-paymaster-general of his\r\nMajesty's forces in the Province, a member of the Council, treasurer of\r\nNew Brunswick, mayor of St. John, and president of the first bank\r\nchartered in the colony. He died at St. John in 1828, aged sixty-seven.\r\n\r\nSeveral other Robinsons were engaged on the royal side in the American\r\nRevolution, but none of them so prominently connected with the British\r\nprovinces as those above mentioned.\r\n\r\n20. _Roger Morris_, of New York, was a captain in the British army, in\r\nthe French war, and one of the aides of the ill-fated Braddock. He\r\nmarried Mary, daughter of Frederick Phillipse, Esq., and settled in New\r\nYork. At the commencement of the revolution he was a member of the\r\nCouncil of the colony, and continued in office until the peace, although\r\nthe Whigs organized a government, under a written Constitution, as early\r\nas 1777. A part of the Phillipse estate was in possession of Colonel\r\nMorris in right of his wife, and was confiscated. In order that the\r\nwhole property should pass from the family into the hands of the\r\nAmericans, Mrs. Morris was included with her husband in the New York\r\nConfiscation Act of attainder. It is believed that this lady, her sister\r\nMrs. Robinson, and Mrs. Ingles, were the only ladies who were attainted\r\nof treason during the revolution, and that merely to get possession of\r\ntheir property. \"Imagination,\" says Sabine, \"dwells upon the attainting\r\nof a lady whose beauty and attractions had won the admiration of\r\nWashington.[138] Humanity is shocked that a woman was attainted of\r\ntreason for no crime but that of clinging to the fortunes of the husband\r\nwhom she had vowed on the altar of religion never to desert.\"\r\n\r\nBut it appeared in due time that the Confiscation Act did not affect the\r\nrights of Mrs. Morris's children, who were not named in, and therefore\r\nnot disqualified by the Act of Confiscation. In 1787, the\r\nAttorney-General of England examined the case and gave the opinion that\r\nthe reversionary interest (or property of the children at the decease of\r\nthe parents) was not included in their attainder, and was recoverable\r\nunder the principles of law and of right. In the year 1809, their son,\r\nCaptain Henry Gage Morris, of the Royal Navy, in behalf of himself and\r\nhis two sisters, sold his reversionary interest to John Jacob Astor,\r\nEsquire, of New York, for the sum of £20,000 sterling. In 1828, Mr.\r\nAstor made a compromise with the State of New York, by which he received\r\nfor the rights thus purchased by him (with or without associates) the\r\nlarge amount of $500,000. The terms of the arrangement required that he\r\nshould execute a deed of conveyance in fee simple, with warranty against\r\nthe claims of the Morrises, husband and wife, their heirs, and all\r\npersons claiming under them; and that he should obtain the judgment of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, affirming the validity and\r\nperfectibility of his title. These conditions were complied with, and\r\nthe purchasers of the confiscated lands were thus quieted in their\r\ntitles derived from the sales of the Commissioners of Confiscated\r\nProperty.\r\n\r\n21. _Allan McNab_ was a lieutenant of cavalry in the Queen's Rangers,\r\nunder Colonel Simcoe. During the war he received thirteen wounds. He\r\naccompanied his commander to Upper Canada, then a dense unpeopled\r\nwilderness. He was appointed Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Assembly\r\nof Upper Canada, and held the office for many years. He was father of\r\nthe late Sir Allan McNab, who was born at Niagara, in 1798, of Scotch\r\nextraction, whose grandfather, Major Robert McNab, of the 42nd Regiment,\r\nor Black Watch, was Royal Forester in Scotland, and resided on a small\r\nproperty called Dundurn, at the head of Loch Earn. Sir Allan McNab,\r\nthough very young, distinguished himself in the war of 1812. In the\r\ninsurrection of 1837 he was appointed to the command of the militia,\r\ndispersed the rebels, and cut out and burnt the rebel steamer\r\n_Caroline_, at Black Rock, for which he was knighted. He was Speaker of\r\nthe House of Assembly of Upper Canada before the union of the two\r\nCanadas, and was afterwards Speaker of the Legislative Council of United\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n22. _Luke Carscallen_ (resident of Bay of Quinté) was an Irishman by\r\nbirth, and had served in the British army; he had retired and emigrated\r\nto the American colonies prior to the revolution. He desired to remain\r\nneutral and take no part in the contest. The rebels, however, said to\r\nhim, that inasmuch as he was acquainted with military tactics, he must\r\njoin them or be regarded as a King's man. His reply was that he had\r\nfought for the King, and he would do it again, consequently an order was\r\nissued to arrest him; but when they came to take him, he had secreted\r\nhimself. The escape was a hurried one, and all his possessions were at\r\nthe mercy of the rebels--land to the amount of 12,000 acres. They,\r\ndisappointed at not catching him, took his young and tender son, and\r\nthreatened to hang him if he would not reveal his father's place of\r\nconcealment. The brave little fellow replied, \"Hang away!\" and the cruel\r\nmen, under the name of liberty, carried out their threat, and three\r\ntimes was he suspended until he was almost dead, yet he would not tell;\r\nand then, when taken down, one of the monsters actually kicked him.\r\n(Canniff.)\r\n\r\n23. _John Diamond_ was born in Albany, with several brothers. An elder\r\nbrother was drafted, but he tried to escape a service so repugnant to\r\nhis feelings; was concealed for some time, and upon a sick bed. The\r\nvisits of the doctor led to suspicion, and the house was visited by\r\nrebels. Although he had been placed in a bed so arranged that it was\r\nthought his presence would not be detected, his breathing betrayed him.\r\nThey at once required his father to give a bond for $1,200 that his son\r\nshould not be removed while sick. He got well, and some time after again\r\nsought to escape, but was caught, and handcuffed to another. Being\r\nremoved from one place to another, the two prisoners managed to knock\r\ntheir guards on the head, and ran for life through the woods, chained\r\ntogether. One would sometimes run on one side of a sapling, and the\r\nother on the opposite side. At night they managed to rub their handcuffs\r\noff, and finally escaped to Canada. Of the other brothers, two were\r\ncarried off by the rebels and were never more heard of; John was taken\r\nto the rebel army when old enough to do service, but he also escaped to\r\nCanada, and enlisted in Rogers' Battalion, in which he served until the\r\nend of the war, when he settled with the company at Fredericksburg. He\r\nmarried Miss Loyst, a native of Philadelphia, whose ancestors were\r\nGerman. She acted no inferior part, for a woman, during the exciting\r\ntimes of the revolution. They were married in Lower Canada. They spent\r\ntheir first summer in Upper Canada in clearing a little spot of land,\r\nand in the fall got a little grain in the ground. They slept during the\r\nsummer under a tree, but erected a small hut before winter set in.\r\n\r\n24. _Ephraim Tisdale_, of Freetown, Massachusetts. In 1775, he fled from\r\nhome, and went to New York. During the war, while on a voyage to St.\r\nAugustine, Florida, he abandoned his vessel at sea to avoid capture, and\r\ngained the shore in safety. Though nearly destitute of money, he\r\naccomplished an overland journey to New York, a distance, by the route\r\nwhich he travelled, of fifteen hundred miles. In 1783 he embarked at New\r\nYork for New Brunswick, in the ship _Brothers_, Captain Walker; and on\r\nthe passage his wife gave birth to a son, who was named for the master\r\nof the ship. Mr. Tisdale held civil and military offices in New\r\nBrunswick. He removed to Upper Canada in 1808, settled in the Township\r\nof Charlotteville, near Vittoria, and died in 1816. He left eight sons\r\nand four daughters. Walker Tisdale, Esq., of St. John (the son above\r\nreferred to), was in Canada in 1845, when the descendants of his father\r\nthere were 169, of whom he saw 163. The Tisdales were active on the side\r\nof the Crown in the insurrection of 1837. The whole family have always\r\nbeen distinguished for loyalty.\r\n\r\n25. _Lemuel Wilmot_, of Long Island, New York, entered the King's\r\nservice as an officer, and at the peace was captain in the Loyal\r\nAmerican Regiment. In 1783 he settled on the River St. John, New\r\nBrunswick, near Fredericton, where he continued to reside until his\r\ndeath, which took place in 1814. Five sons survived him. The Honourable\r\nLemuel A. Wilmot, the son of his younger son William, was a member of\r\nthe Legislative Assembly, and leader of the Liberal party; became\r\nAttorney-General, and afterwards Chief Justice, and ultimately\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the province. He had for many years been\r\nsuperintendent of the Sunday-school, and leader of the choir in the\r\n(Methodist) Church to which he belonged, and continued to discharge the\r\nduties of both offices during the five years that he was\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and until his death, which occurred suddenly in\r\nMay, 1878.\r\n\r\nI have not space to extend these notices of individual combatants in the\r\nAmerican Revolution, though I might add scores to the number of those I\r\nhave already noticed, equally loyal and courageous, and equal in their\r\nenergy, sacrifices and sufferings in fleeing to Canada from American\r\nRepublican persecution, far beyond anything endured by the Pilgrim and\r\nPuritan Fathers of New England, to whose enterprise, energy, and\r\nprivations I have done ample justice in the first volume of this\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe Loyalists fled to Canada, and settled chiefly in Lower Canada, on\r\nthe northern banks of the St. Lawrence, between Montreal and Kingston,\r\non the Bay of Quinté, Prince Edward, the frontiers of the Niagara\r\ndistrict, and the northern shores of Lake Erie. In the following chapter\r\nI will present an epitome of the immigration of the first Loyalists to\r\nthe Bay of Quinté, to the Niagara frontier, and to the northern shores\r\nof Lake Erie, especially of what was called the \"Long Point\" country,\r\ntheir modes of struggling their way thither, the privations and labours\r\nof their early settlement. I will here add a few passages from Dr.\r\nCanniff's _Settlement of Upper Canada, with Special Reference to Bay\r\nQuinté_, in regard to the Loyalists fleeing into Lower Canada, and\r\nmaking their way up the St. Lawrence to Kingston and Bay Quinté.\r\n\r\n\"The batteaux,\" says the late Sheriff Sherwood, of Brockville, \"by which\r\nthe refugees emigrated were principally built at Lachine, nine miles\r\nfrom Montreal. They were calculated to carry four or five families, with\r\nalmost two tons weight. Twelve boats constituted a brigade, and each\r\nbrigade had a conductor, with five men in each, one of whom steered. The\r\nduty of the conductor was to give directions for the safe management of\r\nthe boats, to keep them together, and when they came to a rapid they\r\nleft a portion of the boats in charge of one man. The boats ascending\r\nwere doubly manned, and drawn by a rope fastened at the bow of the boat,\r\nhaving four men in the boat with setting poles; thus the men walked\r\nalong the side of the river, sometimes in the water or on the edge of\r\nthe bank, as circumstances occurred. Having reached the head of the\r\nrapids the boats were left with a man, and the other men went back for\r\nthe other boats;\" and so they continued until the rapids were mounted.\r\nLachine was the starting place--a place of some twenty dwellings.\r\n\r\nIt was by these batteaux that the Loyalist refugee officers and their\r\nfamilies, as well as the soldiers and their families, passed from the\r\nshores of Lake Champlain, from Sorel and St. Lawrence, where they had\r\ntemporarily lived, to Upper Canada. It was also by these or the\r\nSchenectady or Durham boat that the pioneer Loyalists made their way\r\nfrom Oswego.\r\n\r\n\"Thus it is seen that to gain the northern shore of the St. Lawrence and\r\nLake Ontario was a task of no easy nature, and the steps by which the\r\nLoyalists came were taken literally inch by inch, and were attended by\r\nhard and venturesome labour. Records are not wanting of the severe\r\nhardships endured by families on their way to their wooded lands.\r\nSupplied with limited comforts, perhaps only the actual necessaries of\r\nlife, they advanced slowly by day along dangerous rapids, and at night\r\nrested under the blue sky. But our Loyalist forefathers and mothers were\r\nmade of stern stuff, and all was borne with noble heroism.\r\n\r\n\"This toilsome mode of travelling continued for many a year. John\r\nFerguson, writing in 1788 from Fredericksburg, Bay Quinté, to a friend\r\nin Lachine, Lower Canada, says of his journey: 'After a most tedious\r\nand fatiguing journey I arrived here, nineteen days on the way,\r\nsometimes for whole days up to the waist in water or mire.' But the\r\naverage time required to ascend the rapids was from ten to twelve days,\r\nand three or four to descend.\r\n\r\n\"With the later coming loyal refugees was introduced another kind of\r\nflat bottomed boat. It was generally small, rigged with an ungainly\r\nsail; and usually built in the town of Schenectady; hence its name.\r\nSchenectady is a German word, and means _pine barren_. Families about to\r\ncome to Canada would build one or more of these boats to meet their\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\"The Loyalists not only came in summer, by batteaux or the Schenectady\r\nboat, but likewise in winter. They generally followed, as near as\r\npossible, some one of the routes taken in summer. To undertake to\r\ntraverse a wilderness with no road, and guided only by rivers and\r\ncreeks, or blazed trees, was no common thing. Several families would\r\nsometimes join together to form a train of sleighs. They would carry\r\nwith them their bedding, clothes, and the necessary provisions. We have\r\nreceived interesting accounts of winter journeyings from Albany along\r\nthe Hudson, across to the Black River country, and to the St. Lawrence.\r\nSometimes the train would follow the military road, along by Champlain,\r\nSt. George, as far as Plattsburg, and then turn north to the St.\r\nLawrence, by what was then called the Willsbury wilderness, and\r\n'Chataquee' woods. At the beginning of the present century there was but\r\none tavern through all that vast forest, and that of the poorest\r\ncharacter. Indeed, it is said that while provision might be procured for\r\nthe horses, none could be had for man. Those who thus entered Canada in\r\nwinter found it necessary to stay at Cornwall until spring. Two or more\r\nof the men would foot it along the St. Lawrence to the Bay Quinté, and\r\nat the opening of navigation, having borrowed a batteau, descend to\r\nCornwall for the women, children, and articles brought with them. While\r\nthe families and sleighs were transported in the batteaux, the horses\r\nwere taken along the shore by the larger boys, if such there were among\r\nthem. The French train was occasionally employed in these winter\r\njourneys. It consisted of a long rude sleigh, with several horses\r\ndriven tandem style; this allowed the passage among the trees to be made\r\nmore easily.\r\n\r\n\"Travellers from Montreal to the west would come by a batteau, or Durham\r\nboat, to Kingston. Those who had business further west, says Finkle,\r\n'were conveyed to Henry Finkle's, in Ernest Town, where they commonly\r\nstopped a few days. Thence they made their journey on horseback. A white\r\nman conducted them to the River Trent, where resided Colonel Bleecker,\r\nwho was at the head and had control of all Mississauga Indians, and\r\ncommanded the entire country to Toronto. At this place the traveller was\r\nfurnished with a fresh horse, and an Indian guide to conduct him through\r\nan unsettled country, the road being little better than a common Indian\r\npath, with all its windings. The road continued in this state until\r\nabout the year 1798. Sometimes the traveller continued his journey\r\naround the head of Lake Ontario, on horseback, to Queenston, where\r\nresided Judge Hamilton.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: An interesting incident occurred in the early life of\r\nMrs. Morris--no other than that Washington desired to become her\r\nsuitor--a fact which rests on the highest authority. In Sparks' Life of\r\nWashington there is the following passage: \"While in New York, in 1756,\r\nWashington was lodged and kindly entertained at the house of Mr.\r\nBeverley Robinson, between whom and himself an intimacy of friendship\r\nsubsisted, which indeed, continued without change till severed by their\r\nopposite fortunes twenty years afterwards in the revolution. It happened\r\nthat Miss Mary Phillipse, a sister of Mrs. Robinson, and a young lady of\r\nrare accomplishments, was an inmate of the family. The charms of the\r\nlady made a deep impression upon the heart of the Virginia colonel. He\r\nwent to Boston, returned, and was again welcomed to the hospitality of\r\nMr. Robinson. He lingered there till duty called him away; but he was\r\ncareful to entrust his secret to a confidential friend, whose letters\r\nkept him informed of every important event. In a few months intelligence\r\ncame that there was a rival in the field, and that consequences could\r\nnot be answered for if he delayed to renew his visits to New York.\r\nWhether time, the bustle of the camp, or the scenes of war, had\r\nmoderated his admiration, or whether he despaired of success, is not\r\nknown. He never saw the lady again, till she was married to that same\r\nrival, Captain Morris, his former associate in arms, and one of\r\nBraddock's aide-de-camps.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nFIRST SETTLEMENT OF LOYALISTS IN THE BRITISH PROVINCES, ESPECIALLY UPPER\r\nCANADA--THEIR ADVENTURES AND HARDSHIPS, AS WRITTEN BY THEMSELVES OR\r\nTHEIR DESCENDANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1861 I addressed a printed circular to the United Empire Loyalists\r\nand their descendants in the British Provinces of North America, stating\r\nthe design and scope of the history I proposed to write respecting them,\r\nin compliance with a call which had been made upon me by the press and\r\nmembers of all parties, and requesting the surviving Loyalists and their\r\ndescendants to communicate to me, at my expense, any letters or papers\r\nthey might possess which would throw light upon the early history of the\r\nfathers and founders of our country.\r\n\r\nThis chapter contains the letters and papers which I received in answer\r\nto my circular. These letters and papers, with repetitions of some\r\nincidents, contain, in a variety of style, statements and narratives of\r\na remarkable character, and of intense interest, and introduce the\r\nreader to the inner life and privations of the bold, self-denying, and\r\nenergetic pioneers of Canada and of other British provinces.\r\n\r\n_First Settlement of the First Company of Loyalists, after the close of\r\nthe Revolutionary War._\r\n\r\nLetter from the Rev. Dr. Richardson, late Bishop of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church in Canada:\r\n\r\n\"_To the Rev. Dr. Ryerson._\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n\"The following is the narrative of which I spoke to you, relative to the\r\nearly settlement of Upper Canada, as related to me by the late Mr. John\r\nGrass, of the Township of Kingston, some years since, and which you\r\nrequested might be furnished for insertion in your forthcoming history\r\nof _our_ country. I give it to you as near as may be in Mr. Grass's own\r\nwords. The old gentleman, his father, I knew well when I was a boy; his\r\nresidence was next to my father's for several years in Kingston. He was\r\na genuine sample of an honest, plain, loyal German. The narrator was\r\nabout eleven years old at the time he migrated with his father and the\r\ncompany of Loyalists from New York to 'Frontenac,' and therefore had a\r\ndistinct recollection of all the incidents he relates. Being seated in\r\nhis parlour one evening, while partaking of his hospitality, the\r\nconversation naturally turned on events connected with the first\r\nsettlement of the township of Kingston and its early inhabitants, most\r\nof whom had descended to their graves; Mr. Grass was led to state as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"My father had been a prisoner among the French at Frontenac (now\r\nKingston), in the old French war, and at the commencement of the\r\nAmerican revolution he resided in a farm on the borders of the North\r\nRiver, about thirty miles above New York. Being solicited by General\r\nHerkimer to take a captain's commission in the American service, he\r\nreplied, sternly and promptly, that he had sworn allegiance to one King,\r\nmeaning George the Third, and could not violate his oath, or serve\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\"For this he was obliged to fly from his home and take refuge within New\r\nYork, under British protection. His family had soon to follow him, being\r\ndriven from their home, which by the enemy was dilapidated and broken\r\nup. They continued in that city till the close of the war, living on\r\ntheir own resources as best they could. On the return of peace, the\r\nAmericans having gained their independence, there was no longer any home\r\nthere for the fugitive Loyalists, of which the city was full; and the\r\nBritish Governor was much at a loss for a place to settle them. Many had\r\nretreated to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick; but this was a desperate\r\nresort, and their immense numbers made it difficult to find a home for\r\nthem all, even there. In the meantime, the Governor, in his perplexity,\r\nhaving heard that my father had been a prisoner among the French at\r\nFrontenac, sent for him and said: 'Mr. Grass, I understand you have\r\nbeen at Frontenac, in Canada. Pray tell me what sort of a country is it?\r\nCan people live there? What think you?' My father replied: 'Yes, your\r\nExcellency, I was there a prisoner of war, and from what I saw I think\r\nit a fine country, and that people might live there very well.' 'Oh! Mr.\r\nGrass,' exclaims the Governor, 'how glad I am to hear that, for the sake\r\nof these poor Loyalists. As they cannot all go to Nova Scotia, and I am\r\nat a loss how to provide for them, will you, Mr. Grass, undertake to\r\nlead thither as many as may choose to accompany you? If so, I will\r\nfurnish a conveyance by Quebec, and rations for you all till such time\r\nas you may be able to provide for yourselves.' My father requested his\r\nExcellency to allow him three days to make up his mind. This was\r\ngranted, and accordingly, at the expiration of the three days, my father\r\nwent to the Governor and said he would undertake it. Notices were then\r\nposted up through the city, calling for all that would go to Frontenac\r\nto enrol their names with Mr. Grass; so in a short time the company of\r\nmen, women, and children was completed, a ship provided and furnished,\r\nand off they started for the unknown and far distant region, leaving the\r\nhomes and friends of their youth, with all their endearing\r\nrecollections, behind them--the fruits of all their former toil and\r\nsuffering--a sacrifice to their loyalty. The first season they got no\r\nfurther than Sorel, in Lower Canada, where they were obliged to erect\r\nlog huts for the winter. Next spring they took boats, and proceeding up\r\nthe St. Lawrence, at length reached _Frontenac_, and pitched their tents\r\non _Indian Point_, where the marine docks of Kingston now stand. Here\r\nthey awaited the surveying of the lands, which was not accomplished so\r\nas to be ready for location before July. In the meantime several other\r\ncompanies had arrived by different routes under their respective\r\nleaders, who were all awaiting the completing of the surveys. The\r\nGovernor, also, who by this time had himself come to Quebec, paid them a\r\nvisit, and riding a few miles along the lake shore on a fine day,\r\nexclaimed to my father: 'Why, Mr. Grass, you have indeed got a fine\r\ncountry! I am really glad to find it so.' While the several companies\r\nwere together waiting for the survey, some would say to my father: 'The\r\nGovernor will not give you the first choice of the townships, but will\r\nprefer Sir John Johnson and his company, because he is a great man.'\r\nBut my father replied that he did not believe that, for if the Governor\r\nshould do so he should feel himself injured and would leave the country,\r\nas he was the first man to mention it to the Governor in New York, and\r\nto proceed hither with his company for settlement.\r\n\r\n\"At length the time came, in July, for the townships to be given out.\r\nThe Governor came, and having assembled the companies before him, called\r\nfor Mr. Grass, and said: 'Now, you were the first person to mention this\r\nfine country, and have been here formerly as a prisoner of war. You must\r\nhave the first choice. The townships are numbered first, second, third,\r\nfourth, and fifth. Which do you choose?' My father says: 'The _first_\r\ntownship (Kingston).' Then the Governor says to Sir John Johnson, 'Which\r\ndo you choose for your company?' He replies, 'The _second_ township\r\n(Ernest Town).' To Colonel Rogers, 'Which do you choose?' He says, 'The\r\n_third_ township (Fredericksburg).' To Major Vanalstine, 'Which do you\r\nchoose?' He replies, 'The _fourth_ township (Adolphustown).' Then\r\nColonel M'Donnell, with his company, got the fifth township\r\n(Marysburgh). So after this manner the first settlement of Loyalists in\r\nCanada was made.\r\n\r\n\"But before leaving, the Governor very considerately remarked to my\r\nfather, 'Now, Mr. Grass, it is too late in the season to put in any\r\ncrops.' What can you do for food? My father replied, 'If they were\r\nfurnished with turnip seed, they might raise some turnips.' 'Very well,'\r\nsaid the Governor, 'that you shall have.' Accordingly from Montreal he\r\nsent some seed, and each man taking a handful thereof, they cleared a\r\nspot of ground in the centre of where the town of Kingston now stands,\r\nand raised a fine crop of turnips, which served for food the ensuing\r\nwinter, with the Government rations.\r\n\r\n\"The above is at your service.\r\n\r\n\"With much respect,\r\n\r\n\"JAS. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\"Clover Hill, Toronto, 1st December, 1859.\"\r\n\r\nTransmitted to the Author by a gentleman in Nova Scotia, taken from the\r\n\"Political Magazine,\" published in London 1783:\r\n\r\n\"When the loyal refugees from the Northern provinces were informed of\r\nthe resolution of the House of Commons against offensive war with the\r\nrebels, they instantly saw there were no hopes left them of regaining\r\ntheir ancient settlements, or of settling down again in their native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Those of them, therefore, who had been forward in taking up arms, and\r\nin fighting the battles of the mother country, finding themselves\r\ndeserted, began to look out for a place of refuge, and Nova Scotia being\r\nthe nearest place to their old plantations, they determined on settling\r\nin that province. Accordingly, to the number of 500 embarked for\r\nAnnapolis Royal; they had arms and ammunition, and one year's\r\nprovisions, and were put under the care and convoy of his Majesty's ship\r\nthe _Amphitrite_, of 24 guns, Captain Robert Briggs. This officer\r\nbehaved to them with great attention, humanity, and generosity, and saw\r\nthem safely landed and settled in the barracks at Annapolis, which the\r\nLoyalists soon repaired. There was plenty of wild fowl in the country,\r\nand at that time, which was last fall, a goose sold for two shillings,\r\nand a turkey for two shillings and sixpence. The captain was at £200\r\nexpense out of his own pocket in order to render the passage and arrival\r\nof the unfortunate Loyalists in some degree comfortable to them. Before\r\nCaptain Briggs sailed from Annapolis, the grateful Loyalists waited on\r\nhim with the following address:\r\n\r\n\"_To Robert Briggs, Esquire, Commander of His Majesty's Ship\r\n'Amphitrite.'_\r\n\r\n\"The loyal refugees who have emigrated from New York, to settle in Nova\r\nScotia, beg your acceptance of their warmest thanks for the kind and\r\nunremitted attention you have paid to their preservation and safe\r\nconduct at all times during their passage.\r\n\r\n\"Driven from their respective dwellings for their loyalty to our King,\r\nafter enduring innumerable hardships, and seeking a settlement in a land\r\nunknown to us, our distresses were sensibly relieved during an\r\nuncomfortable passage by your humanity, ever attentive to our\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n\"Be pleased to accept of our most grateful acknowledgments, so justly\r\ndue to you and the officers under your command, and be assured we shall\r\nremember your kindness with the most grateful sensibility.\r\n\r\n\"We are, with the warmest wishes for your health, happiness,\r\nand a prosperous voyage,\r\n\r\n\"With the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n\"Your most obedient humble servants,\r\n\r\n\"In behalf of the refugees,\r\n\r\n\"AMOS BOTSFORD,\r\n\"TH.

Hodgson, Chief Justice of Prince\r\nEdward Island._\r\n\r\n\"CHARLOTTETOWN, Prince Edward Island, 12th June, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--\r\n\r\n\"I recently perused, in a newspaper published in Halifax, Nova Scotia,\r\ncalled the 'British Colonist,' a statement to the purport that you\r\ncontemplate publishing a history of 'The British United Empire Loyalists\r\nof America,' and have issued a circular to the descendants of the\r\nLoyalists, asking for information relating to the lives and adventures\r\nof their forefathers.\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen your circular, and possibly the whole thing may be a\r\nmere newspaper fabrication; but it is stated so circumstantially as to\r\ncarry with it an air of truth, and I have been induced to copy a brief\r\nmemoir of my maternal grandfather, Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Robinson, in\r\nhis own handwriting, now in my possession, and to enclose it to you\r\nherewith, to be made use of as you think fit in your intended\r\npublication. The memoir would appear, from a statement contained in it,\r\nto be written in obedience to some order from the then Secretary at War,\r\npossibly calling upon the Loyalists in receipt of half-pay from the\r\nBritish Government for a record of their services, to meet parliamentary\r\nenquiry; it is marked on the back of the draft, in Colonel Robinson's\r\nhandwriting, as 'transmitted.' He died in this Island (formerly St.\r\nJohn's Island, now Prince Edward Island) in 1808 or 1809. Colonel\r\nRobinson was a native of Virginia, and emigrated from somewhere about\r\nJames River, in that province, to South Carolina, where he resided at\r\nthe commencement of the revolution. After a reward had been offered for\r\nhis life, as stated in his memorial, and he had been compelled to\r\nabscond, a party of rebels visited his plantation and burned to the\r\nground his dwelling-house and every building upon it, scarcely giving\r\ntime to my grandmother (as she has often told me) to drag out of the\r\nhouse her two female children in time to save their lives. My\r\ngrandmother was a woman of heroic spirit, and she, accompanied by a\r\nsingle faithful negro slave, made her way on horseback, in an overland\r\njourney of several hundred miles, to East Florida, where she joined her\r\nhusband. In this journey she carried one of her children before her on\r\nthe same horse, and the negro man carried the other in the same way on\r\nthe horse he rode.\r\n\r\n\"At the termination of the contest, my grandfather's property, a large\r\nand valuable one, was confiscated by the victors, and he embarked with\r\nhis family for the island of Jamaica, was unfortunately shipwrecked by\r\nthe way, and lost every particle of property he had left, he, his wife\r\nand children, with difficulty escaping drowning. After a short residence\r\nin that island he emigrated to St. John's, in the Province of New\r\nBrunswick, and ultimately came to this island.\r\n\r\n\"He was a member of the House of Assembly of this colony, and its\r\nSpeaker afterward; an Assistant-Justice of the Supreme Court, and member\r\nof the Executive Council, such Council at that time also exercising\r\nlegislative functions. These last-named offices of Judge and member of\r\nCouncil he held up to his decease.\r\n\r\n\"I was much too young at his death to be enabled to say anything of my\r\npersonal knowledge of him; but from his papers which I have perused, I\r\nam warranted in saying that he was a man of a refined mind, an excellent\r\nclassical scholar, with a great taste for astronomy, and possessing no\r\nordinary talent in that science, which seems to have amused and occupied\r\nhis mind in his latter years. The only reward he received was the\r\nhalf-pay of a lieutenant-colonel (his Judgeship was an honorary one,\r\nhaving no salary or emolument); this he enjoyed up to the period of his\r\ndecease.\r\n\r\n\"I have somewhat hurriedly put together these observations. You may rely\r\nupon the truth of the facts stated, and they are at your service if\r\ncoming within the scope and meaning of your intended history. At the\r\nsame time, if the thing be a newspaper hoax, I must beg you to excuse\r\nthe liberty I have taken in addressing you, and please burn this and the\r\ncopy of the memoir.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"R.

We defeated\r\nthem and destroyed their fortifications.\r\n\r\n\"But in the meantime the violence of the insurgents obliged Lord William\r\nCampbell to depart from his Province, and our small army of Royal\r\nVolunteers was left without further orders, money, or military stores;\r\nwherefore, with much reluctance, I was under the necessity of desiring\r\nthe men to return to their respective habitations, and by all means not\r\nto suffer any false pretences of the rebel party to deceive them, or to\r\nefface their principles of loyalty, until we should enjoy a more\r\nfavourable opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"A reward being then offered for my life, personal safety induced me to\r\nretire to the Cherokee Indian nation, afterwards to the Creek Indians,\r\nand, passing through many dangers and suffering various hardships, at\r\nlength arrived at Saint Augustine, in the Province of East Florida, in\r\nthe year 1777. Soon afterwards, a party of about 300 men, being some of\r\nthose I formerly commanded in South Carolina, joined me there.\r\n\r\n\"I formed the regiment, which was styled the South Carolina Royalists,\r\nof which General Prevost appointed me lieutenant-colonel, and soon after\r\nI received my commission from Sir Henry Clinton, the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\"The said regiment acted in East Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina,\r\nin the course of which service I was in several engagements against the\r\nenemy--viz., at the Alligator Bridge, in East Florida; at Doctor\r\nBrimstone's Plantation, in Georgia; at New Port Meeting-house, in\r\nGeorgia; at New Port Bridge, in Georgia; at Stone Ferry, in South\r\nCarolina; and afterwards at the reduction of Sunbury Fort, in the\r\nProvince of Georgia, and the fortifications of Charlestown, in South\r\nCarolina.

Clark, respecting his Father's Sufferings\r\nin the Revolutionary War, and Settlement in the Midland District._\r\n\r\n\"ERNEST TOWN, July 9th, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. Egerton Ryerson, D.D.\r\n\r\n\"REVEREND SIR,--\r\n\r\n\"Having seen your circular, I write to inform you of my late father's\r\nconnection with the war of the revolution in the then British colonies.\r\nMy father, Robert Clark, Esq., late of the township of Ernest Town, in\r\nthe county of Addington, deceased, was born March 16th, 1744, on Quaker\r\nHill, in Dutchess county, and Province of New York. He learned the trade\r\nof carpenter and millwright, and was the owner of two farms. When the\r\nwar commenced, his loyal proclivities made it dangerous for him to\r\nremain at home, and he joined the British standard as a volunteer in\r\n1776. He had a few opportunities of visiting his family privately, who\r\nconsisted then of a wife and two children (boys); another son was born\r\nduring his absence, who was called Robert (after his father), on which\r\noccasion the nurse--being a violent _Tory_--whispered the secret to some\r\nof the rebels' wives in the vicinity, that Robert Clark was at home,\r\nwell knowing the secret would be divulged; and for several days and\r\nnights after 'there were liers-in-wait' about the house to capture the\r\nTory when he made his exit. At length the said nurse told them they had\r\nbeen hoaxed.\r\n\r\n\"I have a powder-horn now in my possession, which my father owned in the\r\ntime of the war, with his name cut on it, with the date 'Fort Edward,\r\nNovember 4th, 1776.' His family were driven from their home and his\r\nlands confiscated. Being with General Burgoyne's army on the 16th of\r\nOctober, 1777, the day previous to the general's surrender of his army\r\nto Generals Gates and Arnold, Burgoyne mustered the provincial\r\nvolunteers, and told them that he was obliged to surrender his army;\r\nthat they must leave the camp that night, and, if possible, avoid the\r\narmy, and try to find their way to Canada.\r\n\r\n\"They left accordingly, and after some weeks of great suffering and\r\nprivation, my father reached Canada. He subsequently served two years in\r\nhis Majesty's provincial regiment called 'Loyal Rangers,' commanded by\r\nMajor Edward Jessup, and was in Captain Jonathan Jones' company, and was\r\ndischarged the 24th of December, 1783.\r\n\r\n\"In 1782-83 he was employed by Government to erect the Kingston Mills\r\n(then Cataraqui), preparatory to the settlement of the Loyalists in this\r\nsection of the Province of Quebec. While there employed, his wife and\r\nthree children arrived in Canada, in the autumn of 1783; they wintered\r\nat Sorel, where they all were afflicted with the small-pox, and being\r\nentirely among strangers, most of whom spoke a language not understood\r\nby them, they were compelled to endure more than the usual amount of\r\nsuffering incident to that disease; the husband being at a distance, and\r\nin the employ of Government, could not leave to administer to their\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\"In 1784 his family joined him at the Mills, after immense suffering,\r\nhaving been separated by the vicissitudes of war for the term of _seven\r\nyears_.\r\n\r\n\"In 1785 he removed with his family to lot No. 34, in the 1st concession\r\nof Ernest Town (where he had three children born, and of the six I am\r\nthe only survivor), in which year he was again employed by Government to\r\nbuild the Napanee Mills.\r\n\r\n\"He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the (then) district of\r\nMecklenburg in July, 1788, and subsequently an officer in the militia;\r\nhe joined the first Methodist class formed in Ernest Town by the Rev.\r\nWilliam Losee, in 1791, and remained a consistent member during his\r\nlife. He died the 17th December, 1823.\r\n\r\n\"If you can glean anything from the above sketch to assist you in your\r\nnew work, I shall be much gratified.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to be, Rev. Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"JOHN C. CLARK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adventures and Sufferings of Captain William Hutchison, and his\r\nSettlement in Walsingham, County of Norfolk; communicated by his\r\ngrandson, J.B. Hutchison, Esquire._\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning of the wars of 1776, William Hutchison (my\r\ngrandfather) was urged to join the rebel army (he living at that time in\r\nNew Jersey); but he boldly declared, _death_ before _dishonour_. After\r\nbeing harassed about for some time, and leaving a wife and eight\r\nchildren to the mercy of their enemies, he with a number of others tried\r\nto make their way to the British army, and were followed by a large\r\nforce of the enemy; but when they found themselves so greatly\r\noutnumbered (being about ten to one), they tried to make their escape to\r\nan old barn; but every one of the unfortunate men was caught and hanged\r\nbut himself. They did not succeed in finding him, he hiding among the\r\nbushes. While he lay hidden among some elder bushes, one of the enemy\r\npulled up the bush where he lay, saying 'this would be a d----d good\r\nplace for a----to hide,' but the shadow falling on him completely hid\r\nhim from sight. His captain, James J. Lett, was among the unhappy\r\nvictims, grandfather being lieutenant under him at the time. His\r\ncomrades being all killed, he tried to escape from his covert, but they\r\nhad stationed sentries all around; he could hear them swearing vengeance\r\non him if they could find him. It being bright moonlight, he could see\r\nquite a long distance. He crawled along on his hands and knees across a\r\nfield, and got into the middle of the road; when the sentries, one on\r\neither side of him, got into a quarrel and came close to him before they\r\nsettled their dispute; having done so, they turned to go away; he then\r\nmade his escape and got to the British army. After suffering all the\r\nhorrors of a war lasting seven years, losing his property--everything\r\nbut his loyalty--and that, having extended faithfully through the _whole\r\nfamily_, is not likely to be lost. His wife and six of his children died\r\nfrom the sufferings consequent upon such a war. Previous to this he had\r\nreceived a captain's commission. After the war closed, he went to New\r\nBrunswick, and remained there fourteen years, coming to Canada in 1801,\r\nand settled in the township of Walsingham. My father, Alexander\r\nHutchison, was the only surviving son by his first wife. In the war of\r\n1812, my grandfather went out against the enemy with his sons,\r\nAlexander, David, and James, in which war my father lost his life.\r\n\r\n\"Hoping you may be able to find something in these fragments which will\r\nbe interesting to you,\r\n\r\n\"I remain, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n\"Yours most faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"J.B. HUTCHISON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Patriotic feelings--Early Settlement of Prince Edward County and\r\nNeighbouring Townships._\r\n\r\nExtracts of an address entitled \"Scraps of Local History,\" delivered by\r\nCanniff Haight, Esq., before the Mechanics' Institute of Picton, March\r\n16th, 1859:\r\n\r\n\"If I feel a pride in one thing more than another, it is that I am a\r\nCanadian. I rejoice more in being the descendant of these early pioneers\r\nof Canada, than if noble blood coursed my veins. I point you back with\r\nmore unmitigated pleasure to that solitary log cabin in the wilderness\r\nwhich once bordered your fine bay, as the home of my fathers, than I\r\nwould to some baronial castle in other lands.\r\n\r\n\"Is there for honest poverty,\r\n  That hangs his head, and a' that?\r\n\r\n\"The coward slave we pass him by--\r\n  We dare be poor for a' that.\r\nFor a' that, and a' that,\r\n  Our toils obscure and a' that;\r\nThe rank is but the guinea's stamp,\r\n  The man's the gowd for a' that!'\r\n\r\n\"We love our country. Thousands of sweet recollections cluster round our\r\nchildhood's homes, and as we think of them the words of Scott occur to\r\nus:\r\n\r\n\"'Breathes there a man with soul so dead,\r\nWho never to himself hath said,\r\n  This is my own, my native land;\r\nWhose heart hath ne'er within him burned.\r\nAs home his footsteps he hath turned'----\r\n\r\n\"What part of the world can you point me to to show such rapid changes\r\nas have occurred here? Where among the countries of the earth shall we\r\nfind a quicker and more vigorous growth? Seventy years ago this\r\nbeautiful and wealthy county of Prince Edward was one dense and untrod\r\nforest. We can hardly realize the fact, that even one century has not\r\npassed away since those strong-hearted men pushed their way into the\r\nwilderness of Upper Canada. Were they not heroes?\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of the year 1795, or thereabouts, a company of six\r\npersons, composed of two married men and their wives, with two small\r\nchildren, pushed a rough-looking and somewhat unwieldy little boat away\r\nfrom the shore in the neighbourhood of Poughkeepsie, and turned its prow\r\nup the Hudson. A rude sail was hoisted, but it flapped lazily against\r\nthe slender mast. The two men betake themselves to the oars. The sun was\r\njust showing his face above the eastern woods as they pulled out into\r\nthe river. The boat was crowded with sundry household matters--all\r\ncarefully packed up and stowed away; a very small place was left at the\r\nstern, and was occupied by the two women and the children. The mother\r\nwas a small and delicate-looking creature, well and neatly dressed. Had\r\nyou been there, you would have observed tear after tear dropping from\r\nthe pale cheek, as she bent in silence over her youngest babe; and see,\r\nthe eyes of that young father, too, are suffused with tears. Why do they\r\nweep? Whither are they bound? Not a word is spoken. They are too sad to\r\ntalk. Still the oar keeps its measured stroke, and they glide slowly\r\non, and thus may we follow them day after day. Now and then a gentle\r\nbreeze fills the sail, and wafts the small boat on. When the shades of\r\nevening begin to fall around them, they push to shore, and rear a\r\ntemporary tent. Then the frugal supper is spread upon the green grass,\r\nand they gather round it, and forget their toils in speculations upon\r\nthe future. But the morrow draws on, with its demands upon their\r\nstrength; so they lay them down to rest. In due course they reach\r\nAlbany, then a small Dutch town filled with Dutch people, Dutch comforts\r\nand frugality, and Dutch cabbage. This in those days was one of the\r\noutposts of civilization. Beyond was a wilderness-land but little known.\r\nSome necessaries are purchased, and again our little company launch\r\naway. They reach the place where the city of Troy now stands, and turn\r\naway to the left into the Mohawk river, and proceed slowly, and often\r\nwith great difficulty, up the rapids and windings of the stream. The\r\nrich and fertile valley of the Mohawk of to-day was then the home of the\r\nIndian. There the celebrated Chief Brant had lived but a short time\r\nbefore, but had now withdrawn into the wilds of Western Canada. The\r\nvoyagers, after several days of hard labour and difficulty, emerge into\r\nthe little lake Oneida, lying in the north-western part of the State of\r\nNew York, through which they pass with ease and pleasure. The most\r\ndifficult part of their journey had been passed. They reach the Onondago\r\nriver, and soon pass down it to Oswego, then an old fort which the\r\nFrench had reared when they possessed the country as a barrier against\r\nthe encroachments of the wily Indian. Several bloody frays have occurred\r\nhere, but our friends did not pause to learn their history. Their small\r\ncraft now danced upon the wide bosom of Ontario, but they did not push\r\nout into the lake, and away across it. No; they are careful sailors, and\r\nthey believed no doubt 'that small boats should not venture far from\r\nshore,' and so they wind along it until they reach Gravely Point, now\r\nknown by the more dignified name of Cape Vincent. Here they strike\r\nacross the channel, and thence around the lower end of Wolf Island, and\r\ninto Kingston Bay, when they come to shore and transact some business.\r\nThere were not many streets or fine store-houses in Kingston at this\r\ntime. A few log-houses composed the town. An addition was made to their\r\ndiminished stock of eatables, and away they push again. They steer now\r\nup the Bay of Quinté; and what a wild and beautiful scene that must have\r\nbeen! Could those toil-worn voyagers have failed to mark it? Why do they\r\nslacken their pace? Why do they so often rest upon their oars and look\r\naround? Why do they push into this little cove and that? Why do they\r\nlaugh and talk more than usual? Perhaps their journey is drawing to an\r\nend! We shall see. They go up the bay until they reach township number\r\nfive. This township, now known as Adolphustown, is composed of five\r\npoints or arms of land, which run out into the bay. They run round three\r\nof these points, and turn down an arm of the bay called Hay-bay, and\r\nafter proceeding some two miles pull to shore. Their journey it would\r\nseem had come to an end, for they begin at once to unload their boat and\r\nbuild a tent. The sun sinks down behind the western woods, and they,\r\nweary and worn, lay down to rest. Six weeks had passed since we saw them\r\nlaunch away in quest of this wilderness home. Look at them, and tell me\r\nwhat you think of the prospect. Is it far enough away from the busy\r\nhaunts of men to suit you? or would you not rather sing,\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, Solitude, where are the charms\r\n  Which sages have seen in thy face?\r\nBetter dwell in the midst of alarms,\r\n  Than reign in this horrible place.'\r\n\r\n\"With the first glimmer of the morning's light, all hands are up and at\r\nwork. A small spot is cleared away; trees are felled and a house is\r\nbuilt. I fancy that it was not large nor commodious; that the rooms were\r\nnot numerous nor spacious. The furniture, I suppose, did not amount to\r\nmuch either in quality or quantity; an inventory thereof would probably\r\nrun somewhat after this fashion--a pot or two, perhaps a few quite\r\ncommon plates, cups and saucers, knives and forks, a box or two of\r\nlinen, a small lot of bed-clothes, etc., with a\r\n\r\n\"'Chest contriv'd a double debt to pay--\r\nA bed by night, a chest of drawers by day.'\r\n\r\n\"This, ladies and gentlemen, is no fancy sketch, but one drawn from the\r\nshadows of the past. You may find hundreds of similar adventures in the\r\npast history of our country. Such was the first home of the young wife\r\nwhom I have mentioned. She had once lived in comfort, but by the fate\r\nof war the home of a father and husband had been confiscated, and hence\r\nthey had sought for a dwelling-place in Canada, when England offered\r\nother homes to those who had fought her battles. A grandchild of that\r\ncouple now stands before you.\r\n\r\n\"We can form no correct idea of the difficulties which beset these early\r\ninhabitants, nor of the hardships and privations they endured. They were\r\nnot unfrequently reduced to the very verge of starvation, yet they\r\nstruggled on. Tree after tree fell before the axe, and the small\r\nclearing was turned to immediate account. A few necessaries of life were\r\nproduced, and even these, such as they were, were the beginnings of\r\ncomfort--comfort indeed, but far removed from the idea we associate with\r\nthe term.\r\n\r\n\"But time rolled on. The openings in the forest grew larger and wider.\r\nThe log cabins began to multiply, and the curling smoke told a silent\r\nbut cheerful tale. There dwelt a neighbour, miles perhaps away, but a\r\nneighbour nevertheless. The term bears a wide difference now-a-days. If\r\nyou would like an idea of the proximity of humanity and the luxury of\r\nsociety in those days, just place a few miles, say six or eight, of\r\ndense woods between you and your neighbour, and you may get a faint\r\nconception of the delights of a home in the woods.\r\n\r\n\"There are some here, I presume, who have heard their parents or their\r\ngrandparents tell of the dreadful sufferings they endured the second\r\nyear after the settlement of the Bay of Quinté country. The Government\r\nwas to provide food, etc., for two years. It could hardly be expected\r\nthat men could go into the woods with their families, and clear up and\r\nraise enough for their support, the first or even the second year. The\r\nsecond year's Government supply, through some bad management, was frozen\r\nup in the lower part of the St. Lawrence, and in consequence the people\r\nwere reduced to a state of famine. Men willingly offered pretty much all\r\nthey possessed for food. I could show you one of the finest farms in\r\nHay-bay that was offered to my grandfather for a half hundred of flour,\r\nand refused. A very respectable old lady, whom numbers of you knew, but\r\nwho some time since went away to her rest--whose offspring, some at\r\nleast, are luxuriating in comfort above the middle walks of life--was\r\nwont in those days to wander away early in the spring to the woods and\r\ngather and eat the buds of the basswood, and then bring an apron or\r\nbasketfull home to the children. Glad were they to pluck the rye and\r\nbarley heads, as soon as the kernel had formed, for food; and not many\r\nmiles from Picton a beef's bone passed from house to house, and was\r\nboiled again and again in order to extract some nutriment. It seems\r\nincredulous, but it is no fiction, and surely no homoeopathist would\r\ndesire to be placed on a lower regimen.\r\n\r\n\"I feel it unnecessary almost for me to tell you that the largest\r\nproportion of the first settlers of this province were Americans who had\r\nadhered to the cause of England. After the capture of General Burgoyne,\r\nmany of the Royalists with their families moved into Canada; and upon\r\nthe evacuation of New York, at the close of the war, a still greater\r\nnumber followed. A large proportion of these were soldiers, disbanded\r\nand left without employ. Some there were who had lost their estates by\r\nconfiscation; so that nearly all were destitute and dependent upon the\r\nliberality of the country whose battles they had fought, and for whose\r\ncause they had suffered. In order, therefore, to reward their loyalty\r\nand relieve their present necessities, as well as to supply some means\r\nof future subsistence, the British Government determined upon making\r\nliberal grants of the land in Upper Canada and other provinces to the\r\nAmerican Loyalists. The measure was not only an act of justice and\r\nhumanity, but it was sound in policy and has been crowned with universal\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\"The grants were made free of expense and upon the following scale: A\r\nfield-officer received 5,000 acres; a captain, 3,000; a subaltern,\r\n2,000; and a private soldier, 200 acres. A survey was accordingly made,\r\ncommencing near Lake St. Francis, then the highest French settlement,\r\nand extended along the shores of the St. Lawrence up to Lake Ontario,\r\nand thence along the lake, and round the Bay of Quinté. Townships were\r\nlaid out, and then subdivided into concessions and lots of 200 acres.\r\nThese townships were numbered, but remained without names for many years\r\nafterwards. Of these numbers there were two divisions--one including the\r\ntownships below Kingston on the river, east to the St. Francis\r\nsettlement; the others from Kingston, west to the head of the Bay of\r\nQuinté. This will at once explain to you the reason why the old people\r\nused to talk of first, second, third, fourth town, etc., as far back as\r\nwe can remember and up to the present. No names were given to the\r\ntownships by legal proclamation, as we said before, until long after\r\nthey were settled, and hence the habit was formed of designating them by\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n\"The settlement of the surveyed portion of the Midland district, so\r\nnamed because of its then central position, commenced in the summer of\r\n1784. The new settlers were supplied with farming utensils, building\r\nmaterials, provisions, and some clothing, for the two first years, at\r\nthe expense of the nation; and in order that the love of country may\r\ntake deeper root in the hearts of these true men, the Government\r\ndetermined to put a mark of honour, as the Orders of Council expressed\r\nit, upon the families who had adhered to the unity of the empire, and\r\njoined the Royal standard in America before the treaty of separation in\r\nthe year 1783. A list of such persons was directed in 1789 to be made\r\nout and returned, to the end that their posterity might be discriminated\r\nfrom the future settlers. From these two emphatic words, the Unity of\r\nthe Empire, it was styled the U.E. List, and they whose names were\r\nentered upon it were distinguished as U.E. Loyalists. You are aware of\r\nthe fact that this was not a mere empty distinction, but was, in\r\nreality, a title of some consequence; for it not only provided for the\r\nU.E.'s themselves, but guaranteed unto all their children, upon arriving\r\nat the age of twenty-one years, 200 acres of land free from all expense.\r\nI always look back on these early acts of the English nation with the\r\nfathers of this growing Canada with pleasure, and I venerate the memory\r\nof those true and noble-hearted men, who loved their fatherland so well\r\nthat they even preferred to live under the protection of her flag in the\r\nwild woods of Canada, and endure hunger and want, than enjoy the\r\ncomforts of home under the banner of a rebellious but now independent\r\npeople. And I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that we, the sons and\r\ndaughters of those whom our mother country was wont to honour, may never\r\nlove our country and its institutions less than they.\r\n\r\n\"Kingston is the oldest Upper Canadian town by many years. Here the\r\nwhite man found his way over a century before any settlement was made or\r\nthought of. The crafty and industrious French Governor, De Courcelles,\r\nin order to check the encroachments of the Five Nations, despatched a\r\nmessenger from Quebec to their chiefs, stating that he had some business\r\nof great importance to communicate, and desired them to proceed to\r\nCataraqui, where he would meet them. (I observe here that Cataraqui is\r\nan Indian name, and means 'Rocks above water.') As soon as the deputies\r\nof the Indians arrived, a Council was held. The Governor informed them\r\nthat he was going to build a fort there, simply to facilitate the trade\r\nbetween them and to serve as a depot for merchandise. The chiefs,\r\nignorant of the real intent of the design, readily agreed to a\r\nproposition which seemed to be intended for their advantage; but this,\r\nso far from being the case, or what the Indians expected, was really to\r\nbe a barrier against them in future wars. While measures were being\r\ncompleted to build the fort, Courcelles was recalled and Count de\r\nFrontenac sent out in his place. Frontenac carried out the designs of\r\nhis predecessor and completed the fort in 1672, which received and\r\nretained his name for many years. Kingston was subsequently substituted,\r\nand the county received the name of Frontenac.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letters from the late Rev. George J. Ryerse, dated June 12th and June\r\n23rd, 1861, give some particulars of his father's coming to Canada, and\r\nof the earliest settlement of the London District._\r\n\r\nHis father, Colonel Samuel Ryerse, was appointed Lieutenant of the\r\ncounty, and authorized to organize the militia and appoint the officers,\r\nas also the local civil court, of which he was the first Judge. The\r\nfollowing letters indicate what he sacrificed and endured for his\r\nallegiance to the unity of the empire, and for which allegiance he and\r\nthousands of others were banished from the United States and their\r\nproperty confiscated; but the writer has never heard a word from any one\r\nof these veteran Loyalists regretting the part he had taken:\r\n\r\n\"PORT RYERSE, 12th June, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR COUSIN,--\r\n\r\n\"I received your circular some time since, but, through forgetfulness, I\r\ndid not at once give an answer. I am highly gratified with your noble\r\nundertaking, and humbly trust that you may live to succeed and be amply\r\nrewarded. I am sorry that I have no documents that would be of use to\r\nyou. You are aware of the staunch loyalty that was inherent in our\r\nparents, that made them sacrifice everything out of regard for the\r\nBritish Throne, and endure every privation in their early settlement in\r\nthis country. It was in 1794 my father came here, and gave orders to his\r\nfamily that if he should decease while on his way through the United\r\nStates, to take his body to British soil for burying. At that time there\r\nwere but eight families residing within thirty miles of this place,\r\nexcept Indians; no roads; the nearest mill 100 miles distant by water\r\n(at Niagara Falls). My father purchased corn of the Indians at the Grand\r\nRiver, thirty miles from home, and carried it home on his shoulders.\r\nAfterwards he bought a yoke of oxen of the Indians, and on a toboggin\r\nsled put his son, and with his axe and compass made his way through the\r\nwoods and streams to his beloved home. Two years afterwards he built a\r\nsaw mill, and afterwards a grist mill. These nearly proved his ruin, not\r\nunderstanding the business, and very little to sustain them; they were\r\nbadly built, and proved a bother to him, but still a great help to the\r\nsettlement for a long time. Merchandise was so very expensive and\r\nproduce so very cheap that the early settlers could barely exist; but\r\nthey loved their country, and they have gone to their rest, and I feel\r\nproud that so many of their children inherit their spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I am, yours truly,\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE J. RYERSE.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. E. Ryerson.\"\r\n\r\n\"PORT RYERSE, 23rd June, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR COUSIN,--\r\n\r\n\"Your kind letter I received, and in answer to your suggestions I have\r\nto state that my father was a captain in the New Jersey Volunteers\r\nduring the American Revolution; and at its close in 1783, having his\r\nproperty confiscated in the United States, he went to New Brunswick and\r\ndrew lands according to his rank as captain; but being disappointed both\r\nin soil and climate, finding it to be sterile and uncongenial, he\r\ndetermined to remove to Canada. In the spring of 1794 he started and\r\nwent to Long Island, the place where the city of Brooklyn now stands,\r\nand there left his family. While on foot, he went to Canada (U.C.) to\r\nbetter his condition by looking out a more congenial place. Having\r\naccomplished his purpose, he started, at the opening of navigation, with\r\nhis family, in company with Captain Bonta's family, first on board a\r\nsloop (as all was then done by sloops) to Albany, thence by land to\r\nSchenectady, where they procured a flat-bottomed boat, in which families\r\nand baggage were put; thence, with poles and oars, against a strong\r\ncurrent, they made their way up the Mohawk river a long distance, until\r\nthey came to a place called Wood Creek, which they again navigated for a\r\nlong-distance toward Lake Ontario, until they approached a stream called\r\nthe Oswego, which to enter they had to draw their boat by hand across a\r\nportage (I think some two miles); thence down this stream to the lake to\r\nOswego; thence up the lake in this boat westward to the Niagara river;\r\nthence up the Niagara as far as Queenston, where again they had to pass\r\nover a portage of nine miles around the Falls to Chipawa; thence up the\r\nriver eighteen miles to Lake Erie; thence up the lake westward eighty\r\nmiles to the place my father had selected (and which is now my home),\r\narriving here 1st July, 1795. It was in this boat that they went to\r\nmill, as before stated to you. A kind Providence furnished plenty of\r\nfish and game at this early day, or the people could not have survived.\r\nThe total absence of roads, schools, and religious teachers for many\r\nyears were among the heavy privations that the early settlers had to\r\nendure.\r\n\r\n\"I remain, yours truly,\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE J. RYERSE.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. E. Ryerson.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical Memoranda by Mrs. Amelia Harris, of Eldon House, London,\r\nOntario, only daughter of the late Colonel Samuel Ryerse, and sister of\r\nthe late Rev. Geo. J. Ryerse, writer of the foregoing short letters._\r\n\r\nThe husband of Mrs. Harris was an active and scientific officer in the\r\nRoyal Navy, having been employed with the late Admirals Bayfield and\r\nOwen in the survey of the Canadian lakes and rivers, by the Admiralty,\r\nduring the years 1815 to 1817. It was during the progress of this survey\r\nthat Miss Ryerse married. After a few years' residence at Kingston, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Harris returned to a beautiful homestead on Long Point Bay,\r\nintending to reside there permanently. In the days of the early\r\nsettlement, a more refined and cultivated society was to be found in the\r\ncountry than usually in the towns and villages. Mr. Harris was at once\r\nselected by the various Governments of the day to be the recipient of\r\nvarious Government offices. During the years 1837-38 he took an active\r\npart in quelling the rebellion, and is believed by many to have been the\r\nhead and front and organizer of the expedition which sent the steamer\r\n_Caroline_ over the Falls. He was the first man on her deck, and the\r\nlast to leave, having set her on fire.\r\n\r\nThe late Edward Ermatinger, in his Life of Colonel Talbot, refers to the\r\nHarris family as follows:\r\n\r\nA.D. 1834. \"By degrees the officers of the Court removed to London, and\r\nMr. Harris was the first to build a house of considerable dimensions on\r\na handsome piece of ground highly elevated above the banks of the River\r\nThames. This house was long the resort of the first men in Canada, and\r\nin this house the venerable founder of the Talbot settlement lay during\r\nhis first serious illness, while on his way to England. Every man of\r\nrank or distinction who visited this part of Canada became the guest of\r\nMr. Harris--the late Lord Sydenham, the various lieutenant-governors and\r\ngovernor-generals, and the present Lord Derby, were among the number.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following memoranda, which Mrs. Harris wrote more than twenty\r\nyears since, at the wish of her children, but not for publication, she\r\ngives a graphic and highly interesting account of her father's early\r\nsettlement in Canada, and the circumstances of the first settlers, and\r\nthe state of society of that time:\r\n\r\n\"Captain Samuel Ryerse, one of the early settlers in Canada, was the\r\ndescendant of an old Dutch family in New Jersey, and both his father and\r\ngrandfather held judicial appointments under Kings George II. and III.\r\nWhen the rebellion commenced in 1776, and the British Government was\r\nanxious to raise provincial troops, they offered commissions to any\r\nyoung gentlemen who could enlist a certain number of young men; sixty, I\r\nthink, entitled them to a captaincy. My father, Captain Ryerse, being\r\npopular in his neighbourhood, found no difficulty in enlisting double\r\nthe number required, and on presenting himself and men at headquarters,\r\nNew York, was gazetted captain in the 4th Battalion New Jersey\r\nVolunteers, in which regiment he served with distinction during the\r\nseven years' war.\r\n\r\n\"After the acknowledgment of American Independence by England, and the\r\nBritish troops were about to be disbanded, the British Government\r\noffered them a free transport to New Brunswick, and a grant of land.\r\nWhen there, little choice was left to those who had sacrificed all for\r\nconnection with the mother country. On my father's arrival in New\r\nBrunswick he obtained a lot of land in or near Fredericton, the present\r\nseat of government; and there he met my mother, who was a refugee also,\r\nand they were married.\r\n\r\n\"After remaining there several years, his friends entreated him to\r\nreturn to New York, holding out great inducements if he would consent to\r\ndo so. He accepted the offer of his friends and returned, but he soon\r\ndiscovered that the rancorous, bitter feelings which had arisen during\r\nthe war were not extinct, and that it was too soon for a British subject\r\nto seek a home in the United States. My mother loved her native city,\r\nand might not have been induced again to leave it had it not been for\r\ndomestic affliction. She brought from the healthy climate of New\r\nBrunswick four fine children, all of whom she buried in New York in\r\neight weeks. She gave birth to four more; three of those had died also,\r\nand she felt sure if she stayed there she would lose the only remaining\r\none. Therefore she readily consented to my father's proposal to come to\r\nCanada, where his old friend, General Simcoe, was at that time governor.\r\nIn the summer of 1794 my father and a friend started for Canada. The\r\njourney was then a most formidable one, and before commencing it wills\r\nwere made and farewells given, as if a return was more than doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"On his arrival at Niagara he was warmly greeted by his old friend,\r\nGeneral Simcoe, who advised him by all means to settle in Canada,\r\nholding out many inducements for him to do so. He promised my father a\r\ngrant of 3,000 acres of land as a captain in the army, 1,200 as a\r\nsettler, and that my mother and each of her sons should have a grant of\r\n1,200, and each of her daughters a grant of 600 acres.\r\n\r\n\"My father was pleased with what he saw of the country, and heard a\r\nfavourable account of the climate, and decided at once to return as\r\nearly the ensuing year as possible. On his return to New York he\r\ncommenced making arrangements for his move the ensuing spring.\r\n\r\n\"It would be much easier for a family to go from Canada to China now,\r\nthan it was to come from New York to Canada then. He had to purchase a\r\nboat large enough to hold his family and goods, with supplies of\r\ngroceries for two or three years, with farming utensils, tools, pots,\r\nboilers, etc., and yet the boat must not be too large to get over the\r\nportage from the Hudson to the Mohawk. As there were no waggon roads\r\nfrom Albany to the Niagara frontier, families coming to Canada had to\r\ncome down the Mohawk to Lake Ontario, and enter Canada in that way. My\r\nfather found it a weary journey, and was months in accomplishing it.\r\n\r\n\"On my father's arrival at Niagara, at that time the seat of government,\r\nhe called on his Excellency General Simcoe, who had just returned from a\r\ntour through the Province of Canada West, then one vast wilderness. He\r\nasked General Simcoe's advice as to where he should choose his\r\nresting-place. He recommended the county of Norfolk (better known for\r\nmany years as Long Point), which had been recently surveyed.\r\n\r\n\"As it was now drawing towards the close of summer, it would require all\r\ntheir time to get up a shanty and prepare for the winter. Consequently,\r\narrangements were made immediately for continuing their journey. The\r\nheavy batteau was transported from Queenston to Chippawa, around the\r\nFalls, a distance of twelve miles. Supplies were added to those brought\r\nfrom New York, and they once more started on their journey, bidding\r\ngoodbye to the last vestige of civilization. They were twelve days\r\nmaking 100 miles--not bad travelling in those days, taking the current\r\nof the river and lake, adverse winds, and an unknown coast into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"When my father came within the bay formed by Long Point, he watched the\r\ncoast for a favourable impression, and, after a scrutiny of many miles,\r\nthe boat was run into a small creek, the high banks sloping gradually on\r\neach side.\r\n\r\n\"Directions were given to the men to erect the tent for my mother. My\r\nfather had not been long on shore before he decided that that should be\r\nhis home. In wandering about, he came to an eminence which would, when\r\nthe trees were felled, command a view of the harbour. He gazed around\r\nhim for a few moments and said, 'Here I will be buried,' and there,\r\nafter fourteen years' toil, he sleeps in peace.\r\n\r\n\"The men my father hired in New York all wished to settle in Canada, and\r\nwere glad to avail themselves of an opportunity of coming free of\r\nexpense, and promised to remain with him until he had a log-house built,\r\nand had made himself comfortable. He had paid them a great portion of\r\ntheir wages in advance, to enable them to get necessaries in New York.\r\nImmediately on his arrival at Niagara they left him, with one exception,\r\nand went in search of localities for themselves, very little regard at\r\nthat time being paid to engagements, and there being no means to enforce\r\nthem; consequently, he had to hire fresh hands at Niagara, who were men,\r\nlike the former, on the look-out for land. After one day's rest at\r\nRyerse Creek, they re-embarked, and went fourteen miles further up the\r\nbay, to the house of a German settler who had been there two years, and\r\nhad a garden well stocked with vegetables.\r\n\r\n\"The appearance of the boat was hailed with delight by those solitary\r\nbeings, and my mother and child were soon made welcome, and the best\r\nthat a miserable log-house, or rather hut, could afford was at her\r\nservice. This kind, good family consisted of father, mother, one son and\r\none daughter. Mr. Troyer, the father, was a fine-looking old man with a\r\nflowing beard, and was known for many years throughout the Long Point\r\nsettlement as 'Doctor Troyer.' He possessed a thorough knowledge of\r\nwitches, their ways and doings, and the art of expelling them, and also\r\nthe use of the divining rod, with which he could not only find water,\r\nbut could also tell how far below the surface of the earth precious\r\nmetals were concealed, but was never fortunate enough to discover any in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Long Point. Here my father got his goods under\r\nshelter and left my mother, and returned to Ryerse Creek, intending to\r\nbuild a log-house as soon as possible. Half a dozen active men will\r\nbuild a very comfortable primitive log-house in ten or twelve days; that\r\nis, cut and lay up the logs and chink them, put on a bark roof, cut\r\nholes for the windows and door, and build a chimney of mud and sticks.\r\nSawing boards by hand for floor and doors, making sash and shingles, is\r\nan after and longer process.\r\n\r\n\"But soon after my father returned he fell ill with Lake fever; his men\r\nerected a shanty, open in front like an Indian camp, placed my father in\r\nit, and left him with his son, a lad of fifteen years of age, the son of\r\na former wife, as his only attendant. When my father began to recover,\r\nmy half brother was taken ill, and there they remained almost helpless,\r\nalone for three weeks.\r\n\r\n\"My mother hearing nothing of or from them, became almost frantic, as\r\nsome of the party were to have returned in a few days. She prevailed\r\nupon Mike Troyer, the son, to launch his bark canoe, and to take her and\r\nmy brother, then a year and a half old, in search of my father. On\r\napproaching Ryerse Creek, after a many days' paddle along the coast,\r\nthey saw a blue smoke curling above the trees, and very soon my mother\r\nstood in front of the shanty, where my father sat with a stick, turning\r\nan immense turkey, which hung, suspended by a string, before a bright\r\nfire. The day previous, a large flock of wild turkeys had come very near\r\nhis camp, and commenced fighting. Without moving from his shanty, he\r\nkilled six at one shot. He afterwards, at single shots, killed eight\r\nmore, and the united strength of him and my brother was scarcely\r\nsufficient to bring them into camp. My mother used to look back upon\r\nthat evening as one of the happiest of her life. She had found her loved\r\nones, after torturing her mind with all sorts of horrors--Indians, wild\r\nbeasts, snakes, illness, and death had all been imagined. The next day,\r\nMike Troyer's canoe was laden with wild turkeys, and he returned alone,\r\nas my mother refused to separate herself again from my father. A few\r\ndays after, a party of pedestrians arrived, on the look-out for land,\r\nand they at once set to work and put up the wished-for log-house or\r\nhouses, for there were two attached, which gave them a parlour, two\r\nbedrooms, and a kitchen and garret. On removing from the shanty to this\r\nhouse, my mother felt as if in a palace. They bought a cow from Mr.\r\nTroyer and collected their goods, and when cold weather set in they were\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"My father found it necessary to return to Niagara to secure the patent\r\nfor the lands he had selected, and also to provide for wants not\r\npreviously known or understood. The journey was long and tedious,\r\ntravelling on foot on the lake shore, and by Indian paths through the\r\nwoods, fording the creeks as he best could. At the Grand River, or River\r\nOuse, there was an Indian reservation of six miles on each side of the\r\nriver from its mouth to its source, owned by two tribes of Indians,\r\nMohawks and Cayugas, whose wants were well supplied with very little\r\nexertion of their own, as the river and lake abounded with fish, the\r\nwoods with deer and smaller game, and the rich flats along the river\r\nyielded abundance of maize with very little cultivation. They were kind\r\nand inoffensive in their manner, and would take the traveller across the\r\nriver, or part with their products for a very small reward.\r\n\r\n\"On my father's application for the lots he had chosen, he was told by\r\nthe Council that the two at Ryerse Creek could only be granted\r\nconditionally, as they possessed very valuable water privileges, and\r\nthat whoever took them must build both a flour and a saw-mill. My father\r\naccepted the conditions, secured the grant for his own lands, but left\r\nmy mother's for a future day, and at once made arrangements for\r\npurchasing the necessary material for his mills--bolting cloths,\r\nmill-stones, iron, and screws, etc.--and then with a back load of twine,\r\nprovisions for his journey, and his light fusee, he commenced his return\r\nhome, where he arrived in good health, after an absence of twelve days.\r\nIt is only the settlers in a new country that know what pleasure a safe\r\nreturn can give.\r\n\r\n\"Long Point now boasted four inhabitants in twenty miles, all settled on\r\nthe lake shore. Their nearest neighbour, Peter Walker, at the mouth of\r\nPatterson's Creek [now Port Dover], was three miles distant by water and\r\nsix by land. But from this time, 1795, for several years to come, there\r\nwas a constant influx of settlers.\r\n\r\n\"Few days passed without some foot traveller asking a night's rest. The\r\nmost of the travellers would set to work cheerfully for a few days, and\r\nassist in cutting roads, making sheds, sawing boards, or felling timber.\r\nThe winter was now fast approaching, and much was to be done in\r\npreparation for the coming spring. My father succeeded in hiring five or\r\nsix men for as many months. The great object was to get some land\r\ncleared, so that they could plant maize, potatoes, and garden vegetables\r\nfor the next year's consumption. They had also to make preparations for\r\nsugar-making, by hollowing out troughs, one to each tree that was\r\ntapped, sufficiently large to hold the sap that would run in one day.\r\n\r\n\"Their evenings were devoted to netting the twine, which my father had\r\npurchased at Niagara for that purpose. My mother hired Barbara Proyer as\r\na help, and time passed less heavily than she had imagined. My father\r\nhad brought with him a sufficient quantity of flour and salt pork to\r\nlast them a year; for fresh meat and fish he depended upon his gun and\r\nspear, and for many years they had always a good supply of both. My\r\nfather had a couple of deer-hounds, and he used to go to the woods for\r\nhis deer as a farmer would go to his fold for a sheep. Wild turkey and\r\npartridge were bagged with very little skill or exertion, and when the\r\ncreek and lake were not frozen he need scarcely leave his own door to\r\nshoot ducks; but the great sporting ground--and it is still famous, and\r\nthe resort of sporting gentlemen from Toronto, London, and indeed all\r\nparts of Canada West--is at the head of Long Point Bay. I have known\r\nhim, several years later, return from there with twenty wild geese and\r\none hundred ducks, the result of a few days' shooting. Pigeons were so\r\nplentiful, so late as 1810 and 1812, that they could be knocked down\r\nwith poles. Great would have been the sufferings of the early settlers\r\nhad not a kind and heavenly Father made this provision for them. But\r\ndeer were not the only animals that abounded in the woods; bears and\r\nwolves were plentiful, and the latter used to keep up a most melancholy\r\nhowl about the house at night, so near that my mother could scarcely be\r\npersuaded that they were not under the window. The cow, for security,\r\nwas tied to the kitchen door every night; during the day she accompanied\r\nthe men to the field they were chopping, and fed upon browse, which kept\r\nher fat and in good heart--the men making a point of felling a maple\r\ntree each morning for her special benefit. Their first sugar-making was\r\nnot very beautiful, but they made sufficient of a very bad quality for\r\nthe year's consumption. The potatoes gave a great yield; the maize was\r\neaten and destroyed by the racoons; the apple and pear pips grew nicely,\r\nas did the peach, cherry, and plum stones, and my mother's balsams and\r\nfew flowers from the new rich soil were beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"The summer of 1796 passed away with few incidents at Ryerse Creek,\r\nexcept the arrival of settlers.\r\n\r\n\"This year there was a total failure of the grain crops, not only in the\r\nnew settlements, but throughout the United States. The Indians alone had\r\npreserved the maize from destruction by the racoons, squirrels and\r\nbears, which had invaded the settlements by thousands in search of food,\r\nas there were no nuts in the woods. The settlers had now to depend upon\r\nthe Indians at the Grand River for their bread, and they continued to\r\nsell their maize at the same price as formerly, and during the year of\r\nscarcity never raised it. My father procured his year's supply, but\r\nthere were no mills; the nearest ones were south of the Short Hills,\r\nseventy miles distant. Lucky was the family that owned a coffee mill in\r\nthe winter of 1797. My father had a number of hands getting out timber\r\nfor his mills and clearing land, and when they returned from their work\r\nin the evenings they used to grind in the coffee-mill maize for the next\r\nday's consumption. They soon learned the exact quantity required, and\r\neach man ground his own allowance, dividing that of the rest of the\r\nhousehold amongst them. The meal was made into johnny-cakes, eaten hot\r\nfor breakfast, cold for dinner, and the remainder in mush with milk for\r\nsupper; and upon this fare they enjoyed perfect good health, were always\r\ncheerful, and apparently happy.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest good-feeling existed amongst the settlers, although they\r\nwere of all nations and creeds and no creeds. Many of those families who\r\nhad remained neutral during the revolution to save their property, and\r\nstill retained their preference for the British Government, now sought\r\nhomes in Canada, or assisted their sons to do so. The Quakers and\r\nYunkers were amongst the best settlers, as they always brought some\r\nproperty with them, and were generally peaceable and industrious.\r\n\r\n\"Lands were so easily obtained, and so much encouragement was given by\r\nGovernment to settlers, that many of the half-pay officers and soldiers\r\nwho had gone to New Brunswick found their way here, as well as many of\r\nthe idle, discontented, dissipated, vicious and worthless of the United\r\nStates. But at the Settler's Home all were made welcome; the meals,\r\nvictuals and night's lodging were freely given to all, and for years\r\nafter, to my recollection, during the summer season our house was never\r\nfree from travellers; not that there was any particular merit due to our\r\nhospitality, for the man that would have closed his door against a\r\ntraveller would have been looked upon as worse than a savage. My mother,\r\nthis summer, had a dreadful alarm, which she used to describe to me with\r\ngreat feeling many years after. My little brother (George), for whose\r\nsake she had encountered all the privations and hardships of an early\r\nsettler, gave rise to numerous fears and anxieties if he was out of her\r\nsight a few minutes. Endless misfortunes might befall him; he might be\r\neaten up by wild beasts; or, he might be stolen by the Indians (their\r\nstealing children not being a very uncommon occurrence in those days,\r\nand during the summer season there used to be hundreds encamped on the\r\nbeach); or, he might be drowned; or, he might wander away and be lost in\r\nthe woods; and he would steal away and follow the men to the field when\r\nnot closely watched. One day George was missing, and great was the\r\ncommotion. Search was made everywhere, and George's name sounded through\r\nthe forest in every direction. At last his hat was found in the creek.\r\nMy mother sat perfectly quiet on the bank, with feelings not easily\r\ndescribed, while my father probed the deep holes, and thrust his spear\r\nunder the driftwood, expecting every time he drew it out to see George's\r\nred frock rise to the surface, when she heard with delight a little\r\nvoice say 'Mamma,' from the opposite side of the creek. And there was\r\nGeorge, with his little bare head peeping through the bushes, with his\r\npet cat by his side. The reaction was too much for my mother; she fell\r\nfainting to the ground. George had lost his hat walking over a log which\r\nthe men used as a bridge.\r\n\r\n\"The settlement was now considered in a most prosperous state; in a\r\nhalf-circle of twenty miles, probably there was a population of a\r\nhundred. People had ceased to count the families on their fingers, but\r\nno census was taken. The mills were fast advancing towards completion.\r\nSome few of the settlers grew wheat sufficient for their own\r\nconsumption, and a little to sell; but the squirrels, racoons, and\r\npigeons were very destructive to the grain of the early settlers. A dog\r\nthat was trained for hunting the racoons, or a 'coon dog,' as they were\r\ncalled, was of great value, and the young lads, for many years after,\r\nused to make coon parties on fine moonlight nights, and go from farm to\r\nfarm, killing those animals; and, although the necessity has long passed\r\naway, these parties still continue; and, though a virtue and kindness in\r\nthe commencement, have ended in vice, and the coon parties now meet\r\ntogether to rob orchards and gardens of their best fruit and melons. One\r\nbitter cold night in February, 1798, the household was alarmed by the\r\nannouncement of my mother's illness. No assistance was to be had nearer\r\nthan three miles; no horses and no roads--only a track through the\r\nwoods. Mr. Powel, who had just secured a lot near us, volunteered to go\r\nin search of Granny McCall, with the ox-team. After some weary hours'\r\nwatching, the 'gee haw!' was heard on the return in the woods, and Mrs.\r\nMcCall soon stood beside my mother, and very soon after the birth of a\r\ndaughter was announced. That daughter is now making this record of the\r\npast. The settlement was now increasing so fast that the general voice\r\nwas for a town, and my father was petitioned to lay one out at the mouth\r\nof Ryerse Creek, and was at last prevailed upon to do so, and called it\r\nClarence. The first applicant for a lot was a Mr. Corklin, a very good\r\nblacksmith, a mechanic that was very much wanted in the settlement. He\r\nwas a very intelligent young man for his class, and a great favourite\r\nwith everyone, although he had one fault, that of indulging in strong\r\ndrinks occasionally. He bargained for a lot, and put up a frame for a\r\nhouse. My father bought him a set of blacksmith's tools to commence\r\nwith, and built him a shop. The next thing was a wife. My mother soon\r\nsaw that a tender feeling was growing up between the young blacksmith\r\nand her nurse, a pretty girl, to whom she was much attached. My mother's\r\nadvice was against the marriage, on account of his one bad habit; but of\r\ncourse she was not listened to, and they were married.\r\n\r\n\"A few months after the marriage, Mr. Corklin went in a log canoe to the\r\nhead of the bay, on business, and was to return the next day; but day\r\nafter day passed, and no Mr. Corklin appeared. At last the poor wife's\r\nanxiety became so great that a messenger was sent in search of him. He\r\nhad been at Dr. Proyer's, but left the day he was expected home. The\r\nalarm was given, and search commenced along the lake shore. They found\r\nhis canoe drifted on shore, laden with game, vegetables and a few\r\napples, his hat, and an empty bottle that smelt of rum; but he was gone.\r\nThey supposed that he had fallen overboard without upsetting the canoe.\r\nHis body they could not find for days after, and his wife used to wander\r\nalong the lake shore, from early dawn until dark, with the hope that she\r\nmight find his body. One day she saw a number of birds on a drift log\r\nthat was half out of the water. By the side of this log lay the remains\r\nof her husband. The eagles had picked his eyes out, but had only\r\ncommenced their feast. This was the first death in the settlement. My\r\nfather took back the lot, paid for the frame house, kept his smith's\r\ntools, and so ended his town.\r\n\r\n\"Upon more mature reflection, he decided that the neighbourhood of a\r\nsmall town would be the reverse of agreeable, as the first inhabitants\r\nwould be those that were too idle to improve a farm for themselves, and\r\nbad habits are generally the attendants of idleness, and that he, in\r\nplace of being the owner of all, would only be proprietor in common with\r\nall the idle and dissipated of a new country.\r\n\r\n\"On my father's arrival in the country he had been sworn in a justice of\r\nthe peace for the London and Western districts--a very extensive\r\njurisdiction over wild lands with few inhabitants; for those districts\r\nembraced all the lands between Lake Erie and Lake Huron, the Grand\r\nRiver, and Rivers Detroit and St. Clair. Courts were held at Sandwich, a\r\ndistance of nearly two hundred miles, without roads, so that magistrates\r\nhad to settle all disputes as they best could, perform all marriages,\r\nbury the dead, and prescribe for the sick. In addition to the medicine\r\nchest, my father purchased a pair of tooth-drawers, and learned to draw\r\nteeth, to the great relief of the suffering. So popular did he become in\r\nthat way, that in after years they used to entreat him to draw their\r\nteeth in preference to a medical man--the one did it gratuitously, the\r\nother, of course, charged. My father put up two or three small\r\nlog-houses which were tenanted by very poor people whose labour he\r\nrequired. From one of these houses my mother hired a nurse, Poll\r\nSpragge, who was a merry, laughing, 'who-cares' sort of girl. Upon my\r\nmother remarking the scantiness of her wardrobe, which was limited to\r\none garment, a woollen slip that reached from the throat to the feet,\r\nPoll related a misfortune which had befallen her a short time before.\r\nShe then, as now, had but the one article of dress, and it was made of\r\nbuckskin, a leather something like chamois; and when it became greasy\r\nand dirty, her mother said she must wash it that afternoon, as she was\r\ngoing visiting, and that Poll must have her slip dry to put on before\r\nher father and brother returned from the field. During the interval, she\r\nmust, of necessity, represent Eve before her fall. Poll had seen her\r\nmother, in the absence of soap, make a pot of strong ley from wood\r\nashes, and boil her father's and brother's coarse linen shirts in it.\r\nShe subjected her leather slip to the same process. We all know the\r\neffect of great heat upon leather. When Poll took her slip from the pot\r\nit was a shrivelled-up mass, partly decomposed by the strong ley. Poor\r\nPoll was in despair. She watched for the return of her family with no\r\nenviable feelings, and when she heard them coming she lifted a board and\r\nconcealed herself in the potato hole, under the floor. Her mother soon\r\ndiscovered what had befallen Poll, and search was made for her. After a\r\ntime, a feeble voice was heard from under the floor, and Poll was\r\ninduced to come forth, by the promise of her mother's second petticoat,\r\nwhich was converted into the slip she then wore. She ended her recital\r\nwith a merry laugh, and said now she had got service she would soon get\r\nherself clothes. But clothing was one of the things most difficult to\r\nobtain then. There were very few sheep in the settlement, and if a\r\nsettler owned two or three, they had to be protected with the greatest\r\ncare, watched by the children during the day that they might not stray\r\ninto the woods, and at night penned near the house in a fold, built very\r\nhigh, to secure them from the bears and wolves, which could not always\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n\"There were instances of wolves climbing into pens that they could not\r\nget out of. On these occasions they did not hurt the sheep, but were\r\nfound lying down in a corner like a dog. It is said that the first\r\nthought of a wolf on entering a fold is how he is to get out again; and\r\nif he finds that difficult, his heart fails him and he makes little\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\"Wolves were the pests of the country for many years, and, even after\r\nthey were partially expelled by the settlers, they used to make\r\noccasional descents upon the settlements, and many a farmer that counted\r\nhis sheep by twenties at night, would be thankful if he could muster\r\nhalf a score in the morning. It was flax, the pedlar's pack, and\r\nbuckskins that the early settlers had to depend upon for clothing when\r\ntheir first supply was run out. Deerskins were carefully preserved and\r\ndressed, and the men had trowsers and coats made of them. Though not\r\nvery becoming, they were said to be very comfortable and strong, and\r\nsuitable to the work they had to do. Chopping, logging, and clearing\r\nwild lands required strong clothing.\r\n\r\n\"One part of the early clearing was always appropriated to flax, and\r\nafter the seed was in the ground the culture was given up to the women.\r\nThey had to weed, pull and thrash out the seeds, and then spread it out\r\nto rot. When it was in a proper state for the brake, it was handed over\r\nto the men, who crackled and dressed it. It was again returned to the\r\nwomen, who spun and wove it, making a strong linen for shirts and plaid\r\nfor their own dresses. Almost every thrifty farmhouse had a loom, and\r\nboth wife and daughters learnt to weave. The pedlar's pack supplied\r\ntheir little finery, the pack generally containing a few pieces of very\r\nindifferently printed calicoes at eight and ten shillings, New York\r\ncurrency, a yard; a piece of book-muslin at sixteen and eighteen\r\nshillings a yard, and a piece of check for aprons at a corresponding\r\nprice; some very common shawls and handkerchiefs, white cotton stockings\r\nto match, with two or three pieces of ribbon, tape, needles, pins and\r\nhorn combs; these, with very little variety, used to be the contents of\r\nthe pedlar's pack. Opening the pack caused much more excitement in a\r\nfamily then than the opening of a fashionable shopkeeper's show-room\r\ndoes at the present day.\r\n\r\n\"About this time, 1799, a great number of old soldiers, who had served\r\nunder and with my father, found their way to the Long Point Settlement.\r\nOne of these soldiers had been taken prisoner with my father at\r\nCharleston, and when they were plundered of everything he managed to\r\nconceal a doubloon in his hair. With this he supplied my father's wants,\r\nwho was wounded and suffering. My father now exchanged with him one of\r\nhis choice lots, that he might be in the settlement and near a mill; and\r\ntook his location, which was far back in the woods. My uncle [Joseph\r\nRyerson], and several other half-pay officers, came from New Brunswick\r\nto visit my father. The pleasure of seeing those loved and familiar\r\nfaces, and again meeting those who had fought the same battles, shared\r\nthe same dangers, and endured the same hardships, fatigues, and\r\nprivations for seven long years, and had the same hopes and fears, and\r\nthe bitter mortification of losing their cause, was indeed great. How\r\nmany slumbering feelings such a reunion awakened! how many long tales of\r\nthe past they used to tell, of both love and war! Those officers that\r\ncame from New Brunswick to visit the country all returned, after a few\r\nyears, as settlers. The climate of Canada was much preferable, and as an\r\nagricultural country was very superior. The population was now becoming\r\nso great that the Government thought it necessary to have all the male\r\npopulation, between the ages of sixteen and sixty, enrolled in the\r\nMilitia. My father was requested to organize a regiment, and to\r\nrecommend those whom he thought, from their intelligence, good conduct,\r\nand former service, most entitled to commissions. He was appointed\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of Militia and Lieutenant of the County, a situation\r\nthat was afterwards done away with. This duty of selecting officers gave\r\nrise to the first ill-natured feelings that had been exhibited towards\r\nhim in the settlement. Every man thought he ought to be a captain at the\r\nleast, and was indignant that my father did not appreciate his merits.\r\nSome threatened to stone him; others, to shoot him. The more moderate\r\ndeclared they would not come to his mill, although there was no other\r\nwithin seventy miles. John McCall did not care for my father; he would\r\nbe a captain without his assistance. He built a large open boat and\r\nnavigated her for several years, and gloried in the designation of\r\nCaptain McCall. But, notwithstanding all opposition, the regiment of\r\nmilitia was formed. They used to meet one day in the year for company\r\nexercise, and there was a general muster on the 4th of June, the King's\r\nbirthday, for a general training. These early trainings presented a\r\nstrange mixture. There were a few old officers, with their fine military\r\nbearing, with their guns and remains of old uniforms; and the old\r\nsoldier, from his upright walk and the way he handled his gun, could\r\neasily be distinguished, though clothed in home-spun and buckskin, with\r\nthe coarse straw hat. The early settlers all had guns of some\r\ndescription, except the very juvenile members, who used to carry canes\r\nto represent guns. Those trainings used to be looked forward to with\r\nintense interest by all the boys of the neighbourhood, and afforded\r\nsubjects of conversation for the ensuing year. It was no easy thing in\r\nthat day to find a level piece of ground that was tolerably clear from\r\nstumps sufficiently large to serve for their general trainings.\r\n\r\n\"Amongst the early settlers there were very few who could afford to hire\r\nassistance of any kind. Those that could pay found it easy to get men as\r\nlabourers; but women servants, unless by mere chance, were not to be\r\nhad. The native American women would not and will not, even at the\r\npresent day, go out to service, although almost any of the other\r\nneighbours' daughters would be glad to go as helps, doing the same work\r\nand eating at the table with their mistress. My father, for many years,\r\nused occasionally to take the head of the table with his labourers, to\r\nshow them he was not too proud to eat with them. My mother was exempt\r\nfrom this, but the help ate at her table, which was considered a\r\nsufficient proof of her humility. Many of those helps of early days have\r\nsince become the wives of squires, captains, majors and colonels of\r\nMilitia, and are owners of large properties, and they and their\r\ndescendants drive in their own carriages.\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1800 my mother had a very nice help as nurse. Jenny\r\nDecow had been apprenticed to a relative, and, at the age of eighteen,\r\nshe received her bed, her cow, and two or three suits of clothing (those\r\narticles it was customary to give to a bound girl), and was considered\r\nlegally of age, with the right to earn her own living as she best could.\r\n\r\n\"My mother soon discovered that Jenny had a wooer. On Sunday afternoon,\r\nyoung Daniel McCall made his appearance, with that peculiar, happy,\r\nawkward look that young lads have when they are 'keeping company,' as it\r\nis called. At that time, when a young man wanted a wife, he looked out\r\nfor some young girl whom he thought would be a good help-mate, and,\r\nwatching his opportunity, with an awkward bow and blush he would ask her\r\nto give him her company the ensuing Sunday evening. Her refusal was\r\ncalled 'giving the mitten,' and great was the laugh against any young\r\nman if it was known that he had 'got the mitten,' as all hopes in that\r\nquarter would be at an end. But young McCall had not got 'the mitten;'\r\nand it was customary on those occasions, when the family retired to\r\nbed, for the young man to get up and quietly put out the candles, and\r\ncover the fire, if any; then take a seat by the side of his lady-love,\r\nand talk as other lovers do, I suppose, until twelve o'clock, when he\r\nwould either take his leave and a walk of miles to his home, that he\r\nmight be early at work, or he would lie down for an hour or two with\r\nsome of the boys, and then be away before daylight. Those weekly visits\r\nwould sometimes continue for months, until all was ready for marriage.\r\nBut they did not always end in matrimony. Sometimes those children of\r\nthe woods were gay Lotharios in their way, as well as in more refined\r\nsociety, and it would be discovered that a favourite Adonis was keeping\r\ncompany with two or three young girls at the same time, and _vice versa_\r\nwith some young coquettes. But such unprincipled conduct would furnish\r\ngossip for a whole neighbourhood, and be discountenanced by all. Nor\r\nmust you for a moment imagine that there was anything wrong in this\r\nsystem of wooing. It was the custom of the country in an early day, and\r\nI think it is still continued in settlements remote from towns. But the\r\nlives of hundreds of estimable wives and mothers have borne testimony to\r\nthe purity of their conduct. When Jenny had been with my mother about\r\nsix months, young McCall made his appearance in the middle of the week,\r\nand my father and some visitors commenced bantering him why he did not\r\nmarry at once. Why did he spend his time and wear out his shoes in the\r\nway he was doing? He said he would go and talk to Jenny, and hear what\r\nshe said. He returned in a few minutes and said they would be married.\r\nIn an hour afterwards they were man and wife. They married in their\r\nworking dresses--he in his buckskin trowsers, and she in her home-spun.\r\nShe tied up her bundle of clothes, received her wages, and away they\r\nwalked to their log-house in the woods. Thirty years afterwards they\r\nused to show me some little articles that had been purchased with\r\nJenny's wages; and they appeared to look back upon that time with\r\npleasure. They became rich; he was colonel of militia, and some of their\r\ndescendants are worth thousands. During their early struggles, Mrs.\r\nMcCall was in the field with her husband, pulling flax, when she felt\r\nwhat she thought was a severe blow on her foot. A rattlesnake had bitten\r\nher. Her husband killed the snake; vulgar prejudice thought that, by\r\nkilling the snake, the poison would be less severe. He then put his lips\r\nto the wound, sucked it, and, taking her in his arms, carried her to the\r\nhouse. Before he reached it, her foot had swollen and burst. They\r\napplied an Indian remedy, a peculiar kind of plantain, which relieved\r\nher, but she was years before she perfectly recovered from the effects\r\nof the poison. Two children that were born during that time turned\r\nspotted, became sore and died; but her third child was strong and\r\nhealthy, and is still living. These reptiles, that are now almost\r\nunknown in the country, were then plentiful. They had a den at the mouth\r\nof the Grand River, and there was another at the Falls. For many years\r\nthe boatmen going up and down Lake Erie used to stop at the mouth of the\r\nGrand River for an hour or two's sport, killing rattlesnakes. My father\r\nand boat's crew, on one of these occasions, killed seventy. The oil of\r\nthe rattlesnake was thought to possess great medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\n\"There was a sad want of religious instruction amongst the early\r\nsettlers. For many years there was no clergyman nearer than Niagara, a\r\ndistance of 100 miles, without roads. My father used to read the Church\r\nService every Sunday to his household, and any of the laborers who would\r\nattend. As the country became more settled, the neighbours used to meet\r\nat Mr. Barton's, and Mr. Bostwick, who was the son of a clergyman, used\r\nto read the service, and sometimes a sermon. But there were so few\r\ncopies of sermons to be obtained, that after reading them over some\r\nhalf-a-dozen times they appeared to lose their interest. But it was for\r\nthe children that were growing up that this want was most severely felt.\r\nWhen the weekday afforded no amusements, they would seek them on Sunday;\r\nfishing, shooting, bathing, gathering nuts and berries, and playing\r\nball, occupied, with few exceptions, the summer Sundays. In winter they\r\nspent them in skating, gliding down the hills on hand sleighs. And yet\r\ncrime was unknown in those days, as were locks and bolts. Theft was\r\nnever heard of, and a kindly, brotherly feeling existed amongst all. If\r\na deer was killed, a piece was sent to each neighbour, and they, in\r\nturn, used to draw the seine, giving my father a share of the fish. If\r\nanyone was ill, they were cared for by the neighbours and their wants\r\nattended to. But the emigrant coming to the country in the present day\r\ncan only form a very poor idea of the hardships endured by the early\r\npioneers of the forest, or the feelings which their isolated situation\r\ndrew forth. Education and station seemed to be lost sight of in the one\r\ngeneral wish to be useful to each other, to make roads and improve the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"I think it was in 1802 that I first saw Colonel Talbot, a distinguished\r\nsettler, who had a grant of lands seventy miles further up the lake, at\r\na place afterwards called Port Talbot, where he had commenced building\r\nmills. People were full of conjecture as to the cause that could induce\r\na young gentleman of his family (the Talbots of Malahide) and rank in\r\nthe army to bury himself in Canada.\r\n\r\n\"He and Sir Arthur Wellesley had been at the same time on the staff of\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham, when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and it was said\r\nthe field of glory was equally open to both. Colonel Talbot afterwards\r\ncame to this country, and was on the staff of General Simcoe when he\r\nmade a tour through the Upper Province. At that time he selected his\r\nfuture home. Some said that he left the army in disgust at not getting\r\nan appointment that he felt himself entitled to; others, again, said\r\nthat neither Mars nor Venus presided at his birth. But one thing was\r\ncertain: he had chosen a life of privation and toil, and right manfully\r\nhe bore the lot he had chosen. When in the army, he was looked upon as a\r\ndandy; but my first impressions would place him in a very different\r\nlight. He had come to Port Ryerse with a boat-load of grain to be ground\r\nat my father's mill. The men slept in the boat, with an awning over it,\r\nand had a fire on shore. In front of this fire, Colonel Talbot was\r\nmixing bread in a pail, to be baked in the ashes for the men. I had\r\nnever seen a man so employed, and it made a lasting impression upon my\r\nchildish memory. My next recollection of him was his picking a wild\r\ngoose, which my father had shot, for my mother to dress for dinner. Thus\r\ncommenced an acquaintance which lasted until his death in 1853.\r\n\r\n\"My father, on his arrival at Long Point, promised my mother that if she\r\nwould remain contented for six years at Port Ryerse, and give the\r\ncountry a fair trial, if she then disliked it, and wished to return to\r\nNew York, he would go back with her--that party feeling would by that\r\ntime have greatly subsided. My mother now claimed my father's promise.\r\nHe at once acquiesced, and left it to her to decide when they should go,\r\nmy father well knowing that however much my mother might wish to return,\r\nwhen left to her to decide, her better judgment would say 'Not yet,' as\r\nhis improvements must all be a sacrifice. To sell his property was\r\nimpossible. My mother postponed the return for a few years, but could\r\nnot relinquish the hope of emerging from the woods, and being once more\r\nwithin the sound of the church-going bell. My father's property was fast\r\nimproving. He had planted an orchard of apple, peach, and cherry trees,\r\nwhich he procured from Dr. Proyer, whose young trees were a year or two\r\nin advance of his own, and he had procured a few sheep which were\r\npastured in a field immediately in front of the house. But all their\r\nwatching could not preserve them from the wolves. If they escaped by the\r\ngreatest care for a year or two, and the flock increased to twenty or\r\nthirty, some unlucky day they would find them reduced to ten or a dozen.\r\n\r\n\"A tree sometimes unobserved would fall across the fence, and the sheep\r\nwould stray into the woods, which was fatal to them; or, the fastening\r\nto their pen would be left just one unlucky night not secured, and the\r\nmorning would show a melancholy remainder of the fine flock that had\r\nbeen folded the night before. All of these mishaps were serious\r\nvexations to the early settlers. The mill was a constant draw upon my\r\nfather's purse. A part of his lands had been sold at a very low price\r\n(but not low at that time)--one dollar the acre--to assist in building\r\nit, and now it had to be kept in repair. The dam breaking, machinery\r\ngetting out of order, improvements to be made, bolting cloths wanted,\r\nand a miller to be paid--to meet all this was the toll, every twelfth\r\nbushel that was ground. During the summer season the mill would be for\r\ndays without a bushel to grind, as farmers got their milling done when\r\nthey could take their grists to the mill on ox-sleds upon the snow. Few\r\ngrew more than sufficient for their own consumption and that of the\r\nnew-coming settler; but had they grown more, there was no market, and\r\nthe price of wheat, until the war of 1812, was never more than half a\r\ndollar a bushel; maize, buckwheat, and rye, two shillings (York) a\r\nbushel. The flour mill, pecuniarily speaking, was a great loss to my\r\nfather. The saw-mill was remunerative; the expense attending it was\r\ntrifling, its machinery was simple, and any commonly intelligent man\r\nwith a day or two's instruction could attend to it. People brought logs\r\nof pine, oak, and walnut from their own farms, and my father had half\r\nthe lumber for sawing; and this, when seasoned, found a ready sale, not\r\nfor cash (cash dealings were almost unknown), but for labour, produce,\r\nmaple sugar or anything they had to part with which my father might\r\nwant, or with which he could pay some of his needy labourers. There were\r\nsome wants which were almost unattainable with poor people, such as\r\nnails, glass, tea, and salt. They could only be procured in Niagara, and\r\ncash must be paid for them. There was not yet a store at Long Point.\r\nGreat were the advantages of the half-pay officers and those who had a\r\nlittle money at their command, and yet their descendants appear not to\r\nhave profited by it. It is a common remark in the country that very many\r\nof the sons of half-pay officers were both idle and dissolute; but I am\r\nhappy to say there are many honourable exceptions. At the head of the\r\nlist of these stand our present Chief Justice (Sir John Robinson), and\r\nDr. Ryerson, the Superintendent of Education, and many others who deem\r\nit an honour to be descended from an United Empire Loyalist. From a\r\nmultiplicity of care, my father had postponed, from time to time, going\r\nto Toronto, or Little York, as it was then called (where the seat of\r\ngovernment had been removed), to secure the grant of land which had been\r\npromised to his family, until after the departure of his friend General\r\nSimcoe, who was succeeded as Governor by General Hunter.\r\n\r\n\"When my father made application to General Hunter, he was told that an\r\norder from the Home Government had limited the grants to the wives and\r\nchildren of the U.E. Loyalists to 200 acres each; but said that if the\r\nOrder in Council had passed for the larger grants, of course my father\r\nshould have the lands he had selected; but he, not foreseeing the\r\nchange, had not secured the order, and General Simcoe's verbal promise\r\ncould not be acted upon.\r\n\r\n\"The autumn of 1804 found us still in the original log-house. It had\r\nbeen added to and improved, but the stick chimney had not been replaced\r\nby brick, as my father looked forward from year to year to building a\r\nbetter house in a better situation; but he found so many improvements\r\nactually necessary, and so much to be done each spring and summer, that\r\nalthough a great deal of material had been prepared, the house was not\r\nyet commenced. One fine bright morning, as some visitors were taking\r\ntheir departure, there was an alarm of fire, and, sure enough, the stick\r\nchimney had caught and communicated to the garret, and in a few minutes\r\nthe whole of the upper part of the house was in flames. Our visitors,\r\nwho had not gone beyond the threshold, joined with the family and\r\nlabourers in getting out the furniture as fast as possible. Nearly\r\neverything was saved from the lower part of the house, but all that was\r\nin the garret was lost. The garret had been used as a store-room, and\r\ncontained cases which had not been unpacked since they came from New\r\nYork, but were left until a better house could be built. These\r\nthings--linen, bedding, and some nice little articles of furniture, and\r\nvarious little nicknacks which were prized beyond their value--were a\r\ngreat loss: but the greatest loss was a box or two of books. These were\r\nnot to be replaced this side of New York, and to a young family the loss\r\nwas irreparable. A part of Pope's works, a copy of Milton's Paradise\r\nLost, Buchan's Family Medicine, and a Testament with commentaries, were\r\nall that were saved. A small quantity of plate also, which had not been\r\nunpacked, was found in a very unsatisfactory state. The family took\r\nshelter in a house built for and occupied by the miller and his family,\r\nsending them to a smaller tenement. The situation was airy and\r\nbeautiful, and, with a few alterations and improvements, was more\r\ncomfortable than the first log-house. This my mother rather regretted,\r\nas discomfort would have hastened the new house. Although allusions were\r\nmade to New York, no time had yet been named for their return. My father\r\nused to assure my mother and friends that he would go as soon as she\r\nsaid the word; yet these remarks were always accompanied by a\r\nparticularly humorous expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n\"About this time the London district was separated from the Western, and\r\ncomposed what now forms the counties or districts of Middlesex, Elgin,\r\nHuron, Bruce, Oxford, and Norfolk. The necessary appointments were made,\r\nand the London district held its own courts and sessions at Turkey\r\nPoint, six miles above us on the lake shore. The people, in a most\r\npatriotic manner, had put up a log-house, which served the double\r\npurpose of court-house and jail. The courts were held in the upper\r\nstory, which was entered by a very rough stairway, going up on the\r\noutside of the building. The jail consisted of one large room on the\r\nground floor, from which any prisoner could release himself in half an\r\nhour unless guarded by a sentinel. The juries for some years held their\r\nconsultations under the shade of a tree. Doubtless it was pleasanter\r\nthan the close lock-up jury-room of the present day. My father, in\r\naddition to his other commissions, was appointed Judge of the District\r\nCourt and Judge of the Surrogate Court. Turkey Point is a very pretty\r\nplace; the grounds are high, and from them there is a very fine view of\r\nthe bay and lake. General Simcoe had selected it for the county town,\r\nand the site of a future city. Now it boasted of one house, an inn kept\r\nby Silas Montross. There was also a reservation of land for military\r\npurposes. But the town never prospered; it was not in a thoroughfare,\r\nand did not possess water privileges. Twenty years afterwards it\r\ncontained but the one solitary house. The county town was changed to a\r\nmore favourable situation, Vittoria. My father's young family now gave\r\nhim great anxiety. How they were to be educated was a question not\r\neasily solved. Schools there were none, nor was it possible to get a\r\ntutor. A man of education would not go so far into the woods for the\r\nsmall inducement which a private family could offer.\r\n\r\n\"Magistrates were not allowed to marry by license, nor could the parties\r\nbe called in church, for there were no churches in the country. The law\r\nrequired that the parties should be advertised--that is, that the banns\r\nshould be written out and placed in some conspicuous place for three\r\nSundays. The mill door was the popular place, but the young lads would\r\nendeavour to avoid publicity by putting the banns on the inside of the\r\ndoor; others would take two or three witnesses and hold it on the door\r\nfor a few minutes for three successive Sundays, allowing no one but\r\ntheir friends to see it. In many places marriages used to be solemnized\r\nby persons not authorized, and in a manner that made their legality very\r\ndoubtful; but the Legislature have very wisely passed Acts legalizing\r\nall marriages up to a certain date. The marriages that took place at my\r\nfather's used to afford a good deal of amusement. Some very odd couples\r\ncame to be united. The only fee my father asked was a kiss from the\r\nbride, which he always insisted on being paid; and if the bride was at\r\nall pretty, he used, with a mischievous look at my mother, to enlarge\r\nupon the pleasure that this fee gave him, and would go into raptures\r\nabout the bride's youth, beauty, and freshness, and declare that it was\r\nthe only public duty he performed that he was properly remunerated for.\r\n\r\n\"Application had several times been made to the Rev. Mr. Addison, the\r\nonly clergyman in the country, who was living at Niagara, entreating him\r\nto come to Long Point and baptize the children. All who had been born\r\nthere remained unbaptized. This summer his promised visit was to take\r\nplace, and was looked forward to with intense anxiety by both parents\r\nand children. I used to discuss it with my elder brother, and wonder\r\nwhat this wonderful ceremony of christening could mean. My mother had\r\nexplained it as well as she could, but the mystical washing away of sin\r\nwith water, to me was incomprehensible, as was also my being made member\r\nof a Church which was to me unknown. I wondered what God's minister\r\ncould be like, and whether he was like my father, whom I looked up to as\r\nthe greatest and best of anyone in my little world. At last Parson\r\nAddison arrived, and my curiosity was satisfied on one point, and in my\r\nestimation my father stood higher than the clergyman.\r\n\r\n\"The neighbourhood was notified, and all the children, from one month to\r\neight or nine years old, were assembled to receive baptism. The house\r\nwas crowded with people anxious to hear the first sermon preached in the\r\nLong Point Settlement by an ordained minister. Upon my own mind I must\r\nconfess that the surplice and gown made a much more lasting impression\r\nthan the sermon, and I thought Mr. Addison a vastly more important\r\nperson in them than out of them; but upon the elder part of the\r\ncommunity, how many sad and painful feelings did this first sermon\r\nawaken, and recall times long past, friends departed, ties broken, homes\r\ndeserted, hardships endured! The cord touched produced many vibrations,\r\nas Mr. Addison shook hands with every individual, and made some kind\r\ninquiry about their present or future welfare. The same God-hopeful\r\nsmile passed over every face, and the same 'Thank you, sir, we find\r\nourselves every year a little better off, and the country is improving.'\r\n'If we only had a church and a clergyman we should have but little to\r\ncomplain of.' But it was a hope deferred for many long years. A Baptist\r\nminister, the Rev. Mr. Finch, was the first clergyman who came to the\r\nlittle settlement to reside. His meetings were held in different parts\r\nof the settlement each Sunday, so that all might have the opportunity of\r\nhearing him if they chose to attend. He preached in houses and barns\r\nwithout any reward, labouring on his farm for his support. He, like all\r\nthe early Dissenting ministers who came to the province, was uneducated,\r\nbut possessed and sincerely believed a saving knowledge of the Gospel,\r\nand in his humble sphere laboured to do all the good in his power. Many\r\nof the young people joined his Church. He was soon followed by the\r\nMethodists. Too much cannot be said in praise of the early ministers of\r\nthese denominations; they bore every privation and fatigue, praying and\r\npreaching in every house where the doors were not closed against\r\nthem--receiving the smallest pittance for their labour. A married man\r\nreceived $200 a year and a log-house for his family; an unmarried man\r\nhad half that sum, the greater portion of which was paid in home-made\r\ncloth and produce. Their sermons and prayers were very loud, forcible\r\nand energetic, and if they had been printed _verbatim_, would have\r\nlooked a sad jumble of words. They encouraged an open demonstration of\r\nfeeling amongst their hearers--the louder the more satisfactory. But\r\nnotwithstanding the criticisms cast upon these early preachers, were\r\nthey not the class of men who suited their hearers? They shared their\r\npoverty and entered into all their feelings; and although unlearned,\r\nthey taught the one true doctrine--to serve God in spirit and in\r\ntruth--and their lives bore testimony to their sincerity. In this world\r\nthey looked forward to neither preferment nor reward; all they expected\r\nor could hope for was a miserable subsistence. Nor was it surprising\r\nthat in twenty years afterwards, when the path was made smooth, the\r\nchurch built, and the first clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Evans, came, that he\r\nfound a small congregation. Every township had one or two Methodist and\r\nBaptist chapels. I do not recollect one Roman Catholic family in the\r\nneighbourhood. Although the Long Point Settlement was in existence\r\nthirty years before we had a resident clergyman of the Church of\r\nEngland, yet I cannot recollect one member who had seceded from the\r\nChurch. Many had died, and many communed with the Methodists, who did\r\nnot belong to them.\"\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.--At the author's request, Mrs. Harris, in June, 1879,\r\nbrought down her recollections to the close of the war of 1812-1815. The\r\nfollowing pages are the result--written by Mrs. Harris, twenty years\r\nafter writing the previous memoranda, in the eighty-first year of her\r\nage, containing some interesting particulars of the war, and stating the\r\ncause of the loss of the British fleet on Lake Erie, and the disasters\r\nwhich followed.\r\n\r\nThe author has not seen cause to alter a sentence or a word of Mrs.\r\nHarris's manuscript, written by herself in a clear, bold hand,\r\nnotwithstanding her advanced age:\r\n\r\n\"In 1810 my father showed signs of failing health. A life of hardship\r\nand great exertion was telling upon a naturally strong constitution. He\r\ndecided upon resigning all his offices, and his resignation was accepted\r\nupon this assurance, that from ill-health he could no longer fulfil the\r\nduties they involved. The Hon. Thomas Talbot was appointed his successor\r\nas colonel commandant of the militia, and the late Judge Mitchell\r\nsucceeded him as Judge of the District and Surrogate Courts. At this\r\ntime there were strong rumours of war between America and England, and\r\nthe militia anticipated being called into active service. At the close\r\nof 1811, a large body of the militia which my father had organized\r\nwaited upon him, and urged him to resume the command, as in him they had\r\nconfidence. Colonel Talbot was a stranger amongst them, and lived at a\r\ndistance. My father at that time was in the last stage of consumption,\r\nand died in the June following, in 1812, aged sixty years. In six days\r\nafter his death war was declared, and then came troubles to my widowed\r\nmother in various shapes. My father in seventeen years had seen a lonely\r\nwilderness changed into a fruitful country. Most of the original\r\nlog-houses had given place to good frame buildings, and the inhabitants\r\ngenerally seemed prosperous and content. Immediately after the\r\ndeclaration of war, the militia had to do military duty and neglect\r\ntheir farms. British troops passed through Port Ryerse, on their way to\r\nAmherstburg and Sandwich, and every available building was used as\r\nbarracks. All merchant vessels were converted into ships of war, and\r\nthey, with one or two small ships belonging to the Provincial Navy, were\r\nplaced under the command of Captain Barclay, of the Royal Navy; Captain\r\nFinnes, R.N., was second in command. His ships were all of light\r\ntonnage; there were several transports, which were in constant use\r\nconveying troops and army supplies to Sandwich and Amherstburg. The lake\r\nwas clear of enemies, as the Americans were blockaded within Erie\r\nHarbour, where they had two or three large ships on the stocks. They\r\ncould not cross the bar at Erie without lightening their ships and\r\ntaking out part of their guns. This they could not do in the presence of\r\nBarclay's fleet. When the weather was too rough for the blockading\r\nsquadron to remain outside the harbour, it was too rough for the\r\nAmerican fleet to get over the bar; consequently we felt very safe. This\r\nwas during the summer of 1813. During this summer General Brock called\r\nout the militia of Norfolk, and asked for volunteers to go with him to\r\nDetroit; every man volunteered. He made his selection of the strong and\r\nactive young men. Right gallantly the militia throughout the province\r\nbehaved during the three years' war, casting no discredit upon their\r\nparentage--the brave old U.E. Loyalists. During the summer, Captain\r\nBarclay used to have private information--not very reliable, as the\r\nresult proved--of what progress the ships were making on the stocks. He\r\nused occasionally to leave the blockade and go to Amherstburg and come\r\nto Ryerse. The Americans took note of this, and made their plans and\r\npreparations for his doing so. There was a pretty widow of an officer of\r\nsome rank in Amherstburg, who was very anxious to go to Toronto. Captain\r\nBarclay offered her a passage in his ship and brought her to Ryerse, and\r\nthen escorted her to Dr. Rolph's, where he and some of his officers\r\nremained to dinner the following day. When they came in sight of Erie,\r\nthey saw all the American fleet riding safely at anchor outside the bar.\r\nThe Americans had everything in readiness; and as soon as the\r\nwatched-for opportunity came, and the British fleet left the station,\r\nthey got their own ships over the bar, their guns in, and all things\r\nready for defence or attack. They far outnumbered the British fleet, and\r\nwere of heavier tonnage. Captain Barclay consulted his senior officers\r\nwhether it would be best to come into Long Point Bay to winter, where\r\nthey could get supplies across the country from Burlington Bay of all\r\nthe munitions of war, and leave the ship on the stocks at Amherstburg\r\n(the _Detroit_) to her fate, as neither the guns to arm nor the men to\r\nman her had yet been forwarded, and now could not unless by land, which\r\nfor heavy guns and the munitions of war was the next thing to an\r\nimpossibility. It was with great difficulty that food and clothing could\r\nbe forwarded, where there was little more than an Indian path and no\r\nbridges. The wisdom of the fleet decided upon going to Amherstburg and\r\ntrusting to arming the ships with the guns from the fort, and manning\r\nthem with sailors from the fleet, and with soldiers and volunteers. They\r\nlanded Captain O'Keefe, of the 41st Regiment, who was doing marine duty\r\nat or near Otter Creek, to find his way to Ryerse, and to tell the\r\nmilitia commandant that the whole frontier on Lake Erie was now open to\r\nAmerican invasion, the new ship was launched, imperfectly armed and\r\nmanned; and without a sufficient supply of ammunition for the fleet, and\r\nwith little more than a day's rations for his men, Commodore Barclay was\r\nnecessitated to risk an action. The result is too well known. Nearly all\r\nthe officers were killed or severely wounded. Captain Barclay, who had\r\nalready lost one arm, was disabled in the other arm; but they did not\r\nstrike their colours to Commodore Perry's superior force until their\r\nammunition in some ships was all exhausted, and in others nearly so. No\r\none could have fought more bravely than Captain Barclay. At the same\r\ntime, those who knew of his leaving the blockade could not help feeling\r\nthat all the disasters of the upper part of the province lay at his\r\ndoor. In May of 1814 we had several days of heavy fog. On the morning of\r\nthe 13th, as the fog lifted, we saw seven or eight ships under the\r\nAmerican flag anchored off Ryerse, with a number of small boats floating\r\nby the side of each ship. As the fog cleared away they hoisted sail and\r\ndropped down three miles below us, opposite Port Dover. Of course an\r\ninvasion was anticipated. Colonel Talbot was then in Norfolk, and he\r\nordered all the militia to assemble the next day at Brantford, a\r\ndistance of thirty miles, which they did with great reluctance, as many\r\nof both officers and men thought that an effort should have been made to\r\nprevent the Americans landing; but no resistance was offered. On the\r\n14th, the Americans burnt the village and mills of Dover; on the 15th,\r\nas my mother and myself were sitting at breakfast, the dogs kept up a\r\nvery unusual barking. I went to the door to discover the cause; when I\r\nlooked up, I saw the hill-side and fields, as far as the eye could\r\nreach, covered with American soldiers. They had marched from Port Dover\r\nto Ryerse. Two men stepped from the ranks, selected some large chips,\r\nand came into the room where we were standing, and took coals from the\r\nhearth without speaking a word. My mother knew instinctively what they\r\nwere going to do. She went out and asked to see the commanding officer.\r\nA gentleman rode up to her and said he was the person she asked for. She\r\nentreated him to spare her property, and said she was a widow with a\r\nyoung family. He answered her civilly and respectfully, and expressed\r\nhis regret that his orders were to burn, but that he would spare the\r\nhouse, which he did; and he said, as a sort of justification of his\r\nburning, that the buildings were used as a barrack, and the mill\r\nfurnished flour for British troops. Very soon we saw columns of dark\r\nsmoke arise from every building, and of what at early morn had been a\r\nprosperous homestead, at noon there remained only smouldering ruins. The\r\nfollowing day Colonel Talbot and the militia under his command marched\r\nto Port Norfolk (commonly known as Turkey Point), six miles above\r\nRyerse. The Americans were then on their way to their own shores. My\r\nfather had been dead less than two years. Little remained of all his\r\nlabours excepting the orchard and cultivated fields. It would not be\r\neasy to describe my mother's feelings as she looked at the desolation\r\naround her, and thought upon the past and the present; but there was no\r\nlonger a wish to return to New York. My father's grave was there, and\r\nshe looked to it as her resting-place. Not many years since a small\r\nchurch was built on a plot of ground which my father had reserved for\r\nthat purpose; in the graveyard attached are buried two of the early\r\nsettlers--my father and my mother. A.H.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe writer of the following paper seems to have been perfectly\r\nacquainted with the subject on which he writes, but is entirely unknown\r\nto the author of this history. The paper appears to have been written\r\nshortly after the decease of Colonel Ryerson, and was enclosed to the\r\nauthor on a printed slip. It throws much light on the history and\r\ncharacter of the times of which it speaks:\r\n\r\n\"_Last of the Old U.E. Loyalists._\r\n\r\n\"Died, at his residence, near Vittoria, county of Norfolk, on Wednesday,\r\nthe 9th of August, 1854, after a short illness of three days, Colonel\r\nJoseph Ryerson (father of the Rev. Messrs. George, William, John,\r\nEgerton, and Edwy Ryerson), in the ninety-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Ryerson was born near Paterson, New Jersey, about fourteen\r\nmiles from the city of New York, the 28th of February, 1761. His\r\nancestors were from Holland; he was the seventh son; he lost his father\r\nin childhood. At the breaking out of the American revolution, two of the\r\nbrothers entered the British army. Samuel (father of Mrs. Harris, Eldon\r\nHouse, London) was nine years older than Joseph, and was the first in\r\nthat part of the country to join the Royal standard. On arriving at New\r\nYork, he was informed by the British commander that if he would raise\r\nsixty men he would receive a captain's commission. He returned to his\r\nnative place, and raised the complement of men in a few days. Joseph,\r\nwho was then only fifteen years of age, entered the army the 6th of May,\r\n1776, as a cadet. He was too small and weak to handle a musket, and\r\nreceived a light fowling-piece, with which he learned the military\r\nexercise in a few days. In the course of a few months an order was\r\nreceived to embody a portion of these New Jersey volunteers into a corps\r\nof Light Infantry, to go to the South to besiege Charleston. Joseph\r\nRyerson was one of the 550 volunteers for this campaign. When Colonel\r\nEnnis (the Inspector-General of the troops at New York) came to Joseph\r\nRyerson, he said, 'You are too young and too small to go.' The lad\r\nreplied, 'Oh! sir, I am growing older and stouter every day.' The\r\ncolonel laughed heartily, and said, 'Well, you shall go then.' These\r\nLight Infantry volunteers were attached at different times to different\r\nregiments; and Mr. Ryerson was successively attached to the 37th, 71st,\r\nand 84th Regiments. Such was the hard service performed by these Light\r\nInfantry volunteers, that out of 550 men, rank and file, exclusive of\r\nofficers, only eighty-six of them returned, three years afterwards,\r\nafter the evacuation of Charleston.\r\n\r\n\"The Light Infantry corps having been broken up, the few remains of the\r\nmen composing it returned to the regiments out of which they had\r\nvolunteered. About eighteen months after leaving New York, before he was\r\nseventeen years of age, Mr. Ryerson received an ensign's commission, and\r\nhe was, in the course of a year, promoted to a lieutenancy in the Prince\r\nof Wales' Regiment. His first commission was given him as the immediate\r\nreward of the courage and skill he displayed as the bearer of special\r\ndespatches from Charleston, 196 miles into the interior, in the course\r\nof which he experienced several hairbreadth escapes. He was promoted to\r\nhis lieutenancy for the manner in which he acquitted himself as the\r\nbearer of special despatches by sea to the north, having eluded the\r\nenemy in successive attacks and pursuits. He was in six battles, besides\r\nseveral skirmishes, and was once wounded. At the close of the war in\r\n1783, he, with his brother Samuel, and many other Loyalists and\r\ndischarged half-pay officers and soldiers, went to New Brunswick, where\r\nhe married in 1784, and settled and resided in Majorville, on the River\r\nSt. John, near Fredericton, in 1799, when he removed to Upper Canada and\r\nsettled in Charlotteville, near his brother--they both having drawn land\r\nfrom the Government for their services.\r\n\r\n\"While in New Brunswick he was appointed captain of militia; on his\r\narrival in Canada he was appointed major, and a few years afterwards\r\ncolonel. On the organization of London district in 1800 (including the\r\nrecent districts of Talbot, London, Brock, and Huron), he was appointed\r\nhigh sheriff--an office which he resigned, after a few years, in favour\r\nof his son-in-law, the late Colonel Bostwick, of Port Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"During the late war with the United States, in 1812, Colonel Ryerson\r\nand his three eldest sons took an active part in the defence of the\r\ncountry. He was for many years a magistrate and Chairman of the Quarter\r\nSessions; but he would never accept of any fees as a magistrate.\r\n\r\n\"Some ten years since he resigned whatever offices he held. In 1850 he\r\nlost his wife, aged eighty-four years--a woman of sound understanding\r\nand rare excellence. He continued healthy and vigorous to the\r\nlast--having the Friday before his decease rode several miles, and\r\nwalked from Vittoria to his own house--a distance of nearly two\r\nmiles--after which he conversed with much animation and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after his attack on Sunday night, he expressed his belief that\r\nhe should not recover, and stated his entire trust in God, through the\r\nmerits of Jesus Christ, in whom he felt that he had good hope of eternal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"His funeral was attended by a large concourse of people--especially of\r\nthe old inhabitants. Six of his old neighbours acted as\r\npall-bearers--namely, Colonel Potts, F. Walsh, Aquilla Walsh, Abner\r\nOwen, Joseph Culver, and S. Ellis, Esquires--whose joint ages amounted\r\nto almost 400 years. The Scripture lesson was read, and prayers offered\r\nup at the house by the Rev. Mr. Clement, Wesleyan minister; and the\r\nservice was read at the grave by the Rev. George Salmon (an old friend\r\nof the family), in the absence of the Rev. Mr. Evans, rector of\r\nWoodhouse, to the erection of the church of which rectory Colonel\r\nRyerson had been the largest contributor.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Ryerson is probably the last of the old United Empire Loyalists\r\nin Canada who joined the British army in 1776--a race of men remarkable\r\nfor longevity and energy, and a noble enthusiasm for British\r\ninstitutions.\"[140]\r\n\r\n_Interesting piece of Local History by the Rev. Dr. Scadding._\r\n\r\n\"NIAGARA, Aug. 3rd, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n\"I have deferred acknowledging the circular announcing your intended\r\nwork on the U.E. forefathers of the Canadian people, until now, from not\r\nhaving had before a moment of leisure to prepare the contribution which\r\nI intended to offer for your acceptance and use. I only hope that my\r\ndelay may not have rendered the communication too late.\r\n\r\n\"Such a work as that which you propose to bring out is a desideratum,\r\nand cannot fail to be interesting, and increasingly so as years roll on.\r\nI am glad that you have been moved to this undertaking, as I feel sure\r\nthat it will be executed with vigour and thoroughness, in a patriotic\r\nspirit, and with a real affection. Our neighbours in the United States\r\nhave long since seen the propriety of collecting and permanently\r\nrecording the otherwise rapidly evanescent memorials of their past. The\r\nvolumes put forth by their Historical Societies and State Government and\r\nby individuals amongst them, on this subject, possess extraordinary\r\ninterest not only for United States' citizens, but also for the general\r\nreader, and particularly for the inhabitants of the existing British\r\nNorth American Colonies. I have often wished that we could have for\r\nCanada some such publication as Lossing's Field Book of the Revolution,\r\nto preserve for the eye, by woodcuts worked into the text, sketches and\r\nplans of historic places and buildings as they were in their primitive\r\nstate--objects which, in a country like this, from the perishing nature\r\nof materials in many instances, from the levelling of streets,\r\nstraightening of roads, railway excavations, esplanades, building and\r\nother processes and causes, are being so rapidly obliterated.\r\n\r\n\"As you invite information in regard to early settlers generally, I have\r\nthought it simply a duty to send some memoranda--which I hope may be\r\ndeemed not unworthy of use--respecting my father, whom I have supposed\r\nyou might, perhaps, find an occasion of noticing in connection with a\r\nmention of Whitby, in a note or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n\"H. SCADDING.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Dr. Ryerson.\"\r\n\r\n\"This town was, at its commencement, about the year 1819, named Windsor,\r\nby its projector, Mr. John Scadding, the original grantee of a thousand\r\nacres in this locality. On a natural harbour of Lake Ontario, popularly\r\nknown as 'Big Bay,' Mr. S. laid out the town, built the first house, and\r\nnamed the streets, three of them, after his three sons--John, Charles,\r\nand Henry. The appellation 'Windsor' had no reference to the\r\nworld-renowned royal residence, but to a very humble property so\r\ndesignated, once possessed by Mr. S. in the parish of Luppitt, in\r\nDevonshire, from which neighbourhood, viz., Dunkeswell, he first\r\nemigrated to Upper Canada in 1793. Before this transplantation, his\r\nfamily, with numerous kith and kin, had had their home in these old\r\nWessex regions for many a generation. Local registries, tombstones, and\r\nother records constantly exhibit the name, which will also be found in\r\nthe minute Ordnance maps of England, attached to a small hamlet in the\r\nvicinity of Wellington, in the closely adjoining county of Somerset.\r\nThrough the instrumentality of Governor Simcoe, to whom he was\r\npersonally and in the most friendly manner known in Devonshire before\r\nhis emigration, Mr. S. was also the owner and first cultivator of a\r\nsection of land watered through its whole length by the River Don, from\r\nthe second concession to the lake's edge, in the township of York. It\r\nwas while putting off trespassers on a portion of this last-mentioned\r\nproperty, which is now to a great extent included within the limits of\r\nthe city of Toronto, but which was at the time, for the most part, in\r\nits primitive natural state, that he was, at the age of seventy,\r\nunfortunately killed by the falling of a tree in 1824. His widow, Mrs.\r\nMelicent Scadding, survived until 1860, attaining the age of\r\nninety-three years. In 1854, the town of Windsor was incorporated by the\r\nAct of Parliament 18 Vic., c. 28, on which occasion its name was changed\r\nto 'Whitby,' ambiguities and inconveniences having arisen from the\r\nexistence of another Windsor on the Detroit river.\"\r\n\r\n_Loyalty and Sufferings of the Hon. John Munroe, of Fowlis._\r\n\r\n\"Born in Scotland, in 1731; came to America in 1756; married in Albany\r\nMiss Brower, of Schenectady, in 1760; lived at Matilda, U.C., and died\r\nat Dickenson's Landing in October, 1800, aged sixty-nine.\r\n\r\n\"During the revolutionary war he resided near Fort Bennington, where he\r\npossessed considerable property, which was confiscated by the United\r\nStates' Government. He was captain in Sir John Johnston's regiment, and\r\nhis son Hugh was a lieutenant.

That during the time I was engaged at Boston\r\nhe remained in and about New York, till my return, when he gave me every\r\ninformation in respect to the danger of my being taken prisoner; in\r\nconsequence of which I divested myself of every military appearance, and\r\nsecured my papers, etc., on board the _Asia_ man-of-war, and at the risk\r\nof his life he conducted me upwards of 200 miles through the province of\r\nNew York to a gentleman's house near Schenectady, whose son conducted me\r\nup the Mohawk river, on my journey to Canada by way of Oswego, the\r\ncommunication on all other places being shut up. I do also certify that\r\nCaptain Munroe did engage a great number of men to serve his Majesty\r\nagainst the rebels, and that an information was lodged against him on\r\nthat account, and was taken up and tried; that though many of the men\r\nwere never able to join the King's troops in Canada, yet numbers joined\r\nSir John Johnston's regiment, and others joined the 84th, under my\r\ncommand; and that in defiance of all the hardships, difficulties, and\r\ndangers he was exposed to, he has ever adhered to the same loyal\r\nprinciples, notwithstanding he was eighteen months a close prisoner,\r\nmostly in irons; that he made his escape from prison in Albany; was\r\nunfortunately retaken and confined at Esopsus, on the Hudson river, and\r\nwould infallibly have been hanged (his sentence having been pronounced)\r\nhad he not made his escape; that I am acquainted with Mrs. Munroe and\r\nher family of eight children, which has hitherto been brought up in a\r\ngenteel sphere of life; and that I always understood Captain Munroe to\r\nbe a gentleman of considerable property in the province of New York, and\r\nas an officer always behaved with becoming spirit and resolution.\r\n\r\n\"ALLEN MACLEAN,\r\n\r\n\"Late Brigadier-General in Canada.\"\r\n\r\n_Captain Duncan Campbell's Certificate, Late of the 84th Regiment._\r\n\r\n\"I do hereby certify, that I have been well acquainted with Captain John\r\nMunroe, late of the King's Regiment, of New York, for many years, while\r\nhe followed the mercantile way of business in America's last war, and\r\never since; that he always bore the character of an honest and\r\nrespectable gentleman amongst his numerous acquaintances. I also knew\r\nhim to be a zealous friend to the interest of his King and country, and\r\nthat he and his family have suffered the greatest cruelties by the\r\nrebels, and the loss of all his property. I also know that he laid a\r\npermanent foundation for his family in the province of New York by his\r\nindefatigable industry; that I have been different times at his last\r\nplace of abode, where I have seen most part of the improvements he had\r\nmade, though at that time in a manner beginning, where he had an\r\nexcellent dwelling-house, a saw and grist mills, with other\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n\"That I know him to have a very large family, and a thriving and growing\r\nproperty in the county of Albany, and province of New York.\r\n\r\n\"DUNCAN CAMPBELL,\r\n\r\n\"Late Captain of the 84th Regiment.\r\n\r\n\"No. 8 Fley Market, St. James.\"\r\n\r\n_General Tryon's Certificate._\r\n\r\n\"I do certify that I know Captain Munroe, during the time that I was\r\nGovernor of the Province of New York, to be an active magistrate; that\r\nin the year 1776, at the period I was on board the _Duchess of Gordon_,\r\nhe came from his place of abode, two hundred miles through the rebel\r\nposts, on the Hudson river, and with difficulty got on board, when he\r\ninformed me of several particulars relative to the situation of the\r\nrebel armies, and the preparations they were making for defence in the\r\nhighlands.\r\n\r\n\"He also communicated to me his distress for want of money to pay the\r\nrecruits he had engaged for General Maclean's regiment, on which I\r\nadvanced him such a sum as he thought he could carry with safety.

I had, in accordance with my own strong convictions and in\r\ncompliance with many solicitations, determined to attempt an act of\r\njustice and gratitude to that noble generation of men and women. I have\r\nbeen favoured with a large number of letters similar to that which\r\nfollows, and which will form an interesting Appendix of information and\r\ntestimony to any history which may be written of them. I have not been\r\nable to complete my task; but if my life and strength be spared, and if\r\nI can be released from official labours which weigh so heavily upon my\r\ntime and strength, I shall be able to complete what I have undertaken\r\nand long prosecuted, namely, contribute something to settle many\r\nunsettled and disputed facts of American and Canadian history, and to\r\ndo, at least, a modicum of justice to a Canadian ancestry whose heroic\r\ndeeds and unswerving Christian patriotism form a patent of nobility more\r\nto be valued by their descendants than the coronets of many modern\r\nnoblemen.\r\n\r\n\"The following letter is founded on the testimony of those who were\r\nincapable of knowingly perverting the truth in any particular, and tends\r\nto prove and illustrate, by its artless statements, the true\r\ndisinterested loyalty and Christian patriotism of those who adhered to\r\nBritish connection in the American revolution; their cruel treatment\r\nfrom the professed friends of liberty; their privations, sufferings,\r\ncourage, and industry in settling this country; or who, as it is\r\nbeautifully expressed in the following letter, 'with their hoes planted\r\nthe germ of its future greatness.'\r\n\r\n\"Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"E. RYERSON.\r\n\r\n\"Toronto, February 15, 1875.\"\r\n\r\n\"ANCASTER, July 23rd, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"REV. AND DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n\"I have long wished some person would give the world a true history of\r\nthat much-traduced and suffering people, the U.E. Loyalists; and I\r\nassure you that when your circular came I was greatly rejoiced to learn\r\nthat they would at least get justice from such an able source as\r\nyourself; and if the plain narrative of the sufferings of my forefathers\r\nwill assist you in the least in your arduous and praiseworthy\r\nundertaking, I will be exceedingly gratified.\r\n\r\n\"My great-grandfather emigrated from Germany in the reign of Queen Anne.\r\nHe settled near the Mohawk river, at a creek that still bears his name\r\n(Bowman's Creek). My grandfather, Jacob Bowman, joined the British army\r\nin the French war; at the conclusion of peace he was awarded 1,500\r\nacres of land on the Susquehanna river, where he made improvements until\r\nthe revolutionary war broke out. The delicate state of my grandmother\r\nobliged him to remain at home, while nearly all that remained firm to\r\ntheir allegiance left for the British army.\r\n\r\n\"He was surprised at night, while his wife was sick, by a party of\r\nrebels, and with his eldest son, a lad of sixteen years of age, was\r\ntaken prisoner; his house pillaged of every article except the bed on\r\nwhich his sick wife lay, and that they stripped of all but one blanket.\r\nHalf an hour after my grandfather was marched off, his youngest child\r\nwas born. This was in November. There my grandmother was, with an infant\r\nbabe and six children, at the commencement of winter, without any\r\nprovisions, and only one blanket in the house. Their cattle and grain\r\nwere all taken away.\r\n\r\n\"My father, Peter Bowman, the eldest son at home, was only eleven years\r\nold. As the pillage was at night, he had neither coat nor shoes; he had\r\nto cut and draw his firewood half a mile on a hand-sleigh to keep his\r\nsick mother from freezing; this he did barefooted. The whole family\r\nwould have perished had it not been for some friendly Indians that\r\nbrought them provisions. One gave my father a blanket, coat and a pair\r\nof mocassins. A kind squaw doctored my grandmother, but she suffered so\r\nmuch through want and anxiety that it was not until spring that she was\r\nable to do anything. She then took her children and went to the Mohawk\r\nriver, where they planted corn and potatoes; and in the fall the\r\ncommander of the British forces at Niagara, hearing of their destitute\r\nsituation, sent a party with some Indians to bring them in. They brought\r\nin five families: the Nellises, Secords, Youngs, Bucks, and our own\r\nfamily (Bowman), five women and thirty-one children, and only one pair\r\nof shoes among them all. They arrived at Fort George on the 3rd of\r\nNovember, 1776; from there they were sent first to Montreal, and then to\r\nQuebec, where the Government took care of them--that is, gave them\r\n_something to eat_ and barracks to sleep in. My grandmother was exposed\r\nto cold and damp so much that she took the rheumatism, and never\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1777 my father joined Butler's Rangers, and was with\r\nColonel Butler in all his campaigns. His brother, only nine years old,\r\nwent as a fifer.\r\n\r\n\"But to return to my grandfather, Jacob Bowman: his captors took him and\r\nhis son to Philadelphia, where he was confined in jail eighteen months.\r\nAn exchange of prisoners then took place, and they were sent to New\r\nYork; from there he, with his son and Philip Buck, started for their\r\nhomes, not knowing that these homes they never would see again, and that\r\ntheir families were far away in the wilds of Canada. The third evening\r\nafter they started for their homes, they came to a pond, and shot some\r\nducks for their supper. The report of their guns was heard by some\r\nAmerican scouts, who concealed themselves until our poor fellows were\r\nasleep, when they came stealthily up and fired. Six shots took effect on\r\nmy uncle, as he lay with his hat over his ear. Five balls went through\r\nit, and one through his thigh. My grandfather and Buck lay on the\r\nopposite side of the fire. They sprang into the bushes, but when they\r\nheard the groans of my uncle, grandfather returned and gave himself up.\r\nBuck made his escape. They then marched off, carrying the wounded boy\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\"They were taken to the nearest American station, where grandfather was\r\nallowed the privilege of taking care of his wounded son. As he began to\r\nrecover, grandfather was again ordered to abjure the British Government,\r\nwhich he steadfastly refused to do. He was then taken to Lancaster jail,\r\nwith Mr. Hoover. They were there fastened together by a band of iron\r\naround their arms, and a chain with three links around their ankles, the\r\nweight of which was ninety-six pounds; and then fastened by a ring and\r\nstaple to the floor. In that condition they remained either three years\r\nand a half or four years and a half, until the flesh was worn away and\r\nthe bones laid bare four inches.\r\n\r\n\"Men, women, and children all went to work, clearing land. There were\r\nnone to make improvements in Canada then but the U.E. Loyalists, and\r\nthey, _with their hoes, planted the germ of its future greatness_. About\r\nthis time, my father with his brother returned from the army; they\r\nhelped their father two years, and then took up land for themselves near\r\nFort Erie.\r\n\r\n\"My father married the daughter of a Loyalist from Hudson, North River\r\n(Mr. Frederick Lampman); he was too old to serve in the war, but his\r\nfour sons and two sons in-law did. They were greatly harassed, but they\r\nhid in the cellars and bushes for three months, the rebels hunting them\r\nnight and day. At length an opportunity offered, and they made their\r\nescape to Long Island, where they joined the British army. One of his\r\nsons, Wilhelmus Lampman, returning home to see his family, was caught by\r\nthe rebels within a short distance of his father's house, and _hanged_,\r\nbecause, as they said, he was a Tory.\r\n\r\n\"At the restoration of peace, the whole family came to Canada. They\r\nbrought their horses and cattle with them, which helped to supply the\r\nnew country. They settled in the township of Stamford, where their\r\ndescendants are yet.\r\n\r\n\"My father settled on his land near the fort; he drew an axe and a hoe\r\nfrom Government. He bought a yoke of yearling steers; this was the\r\namount of his farming utensils. Mother had a cow, bed, six plates, three\r\nknives, and a few other articles. It was the scarce year, on account of\r\nthe rush of Loyalists from the States, who had heard that Canada was a\r\ngood country, where they could live under their own loved institutions,\r\nand enjoy the protection of England.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of grain that the U.E. Loyalists had raised was hardly\r\nsufficient for themselves; still they divided with the new comers, as\r\nall were alike destitute. After planting corn and potatoes, they had\r\nnothing left. My father cleared two acres, on which he planted corn,\r\npotatoes, oats, and flax; his calves were not able to work, and he had\r\nto carry all the rails on his shoulders until the skin was worn off them\r\nboth. This was the way he made his first fence. In the beginning of May\r\n[1789], their provisions failed; none to be had: Government promised\r\nassistance, still none came. All eyes turned toward their harvest, which\r\nwas more than three months away; their only resource was the leaves of\r\ntrees. Some hunted ground nuts; many lived on herbs; those that were\r\nnear the river, on fish. My father used to work until near sun-down,\r\nthen walk three miles to the river, get light wood, fish all night, in\r\nthe morning divide the fish, carry his share home on his back, which\r\nthey ate without bread or salt. This he did twice a week, until the\r\nmiddle of June, when the moss became so thick in the river that they\r\ncould not see a fish; still they worked on, and hoped on every day. My\r\nfather chopped the logs and they had milk for their breakfast, then\r\nwent to work until noon; took their dinner on milk; to work again till\r\nnight, and supped on milk. I have frequently heard my mother say she\r\nnever was discouraged or discontented; thankful they were that they\r\ncould eat their morsel in peace.\r\n\r\n\"Their only crime was loyalty to the Government which they had sworn\r\nfealty to. The God of Heaven saw all this, and the sword of vengeance is\r\nnow, in 1861, drawn over the American people (now they know how to\r\nappreciate loyalty), and will perhaps never be sheathed again until they\r\nmake some restitution for the unheard-of cruelties they inflicted upon\r\nthose most brave and loyal people.\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the war they were liberated. Grandfather was sent to\r\nthe hospital for nearly a year, but his leg never got entirely well. As\r\nsoon as he was able to walk, he sent for his family (it had been eight\r\nyears since he saw them): they had suffered everything but death. Coming\r\nin the boats from Quebec, they got out of provisions and were near\r\nstarving. He never had his family all together again. He drew land near\r\nthe Falls of Niagara, where he went to work in the woods, broken down\r\nwith suffering, worn out with age; his property destroyed, his land\r\nconfiscated, and his family scattered; without money or means, and worse\r\nthan all, without provisions. Still, to work they went with willing\r\nhands and cheerful hearts, and often did he say he never felt inclined\r\nto murmur. He had done his duty to God and his country; his own and his\r\nfamily's sufferings he could not help. Theirs was not a solitary case;\r\nall the Loyalists suffered. The Government found seed to plant and sow\r\nthe first year; they gave them axes and hoes, and promised them\r\nprovisions. How far that promise was fulfilled, you well know; they got\r\nvery little; they soon found that they had to provide for themselves.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the wheat was large enough to rub out, they boiled it, which\r\nto them was a great treat. Providence favoured them with an early\r\nharvest; their sufferings were over, and not one had starved to death.\r\nThey now had enough, and they were thankful. Heaven smiled, and in a few\r\nyears they had an abundance for themselves and others.\r\n\r\n\"I have no memorandum to refer to. I have just related the tale I have\r\noften heard my parents tell, without any exaggeration, but with many\r\nomissions. I have not told you about my father's sufferings in the army,\r\nwhen, upon an expedition near Little Miamac, he and some others were\r\nleft to carry the wounded. They got out of provisions: went three days\r\nwithout anything to eat, except one pigeon between nine. I will give you\r\nhis own words. He says: 'The first day we came to where an Indian's old\r\npack-horse had mired in the mud; it had lain there ten days in the heat\r\nof summer; the smell was dreadful; still some of our men cut out slices,\r\nroasted and ate it; I was not hungry enough. The next day I shot a\r\npigeon, which made a dinner for nine; after that we found the skin of a\r\ndeer, from the knee to the hoof. This we divided and ate. I would\r\nwillingly, had I possessed it, have given my hat full of gold for a\r\npiece of bread as large as my hand. Often did I think of the milk and\r\nswill I had seen left in my father's _hog-trough_, and thought if I only\r\nhad that I would be satisfied.'\r\n\r\n\"Such were some of the sufferings of my forefathers for supremacy. They\r\nhave gone to their reward. Peace to their ashes!\r\n\r\n\"Yours, respectfully,\r\n\r\n\"Dr. E. Ryerson.\" \"ELIZABETH BOWMAN SPOHN.\"\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--One thing more I must add: My father always said there never was\r\nany cruelty inflicted upon either man, woman or child by Butler's\r\nRangers, that he ever heard of, during the war. They did everything in\r\ntheir power to get the Indians to bring their prisoners in for\r\nredemption, and urged them to treat them kindly; the officers always\r\ntelling them that it was more brave to take a prisoner than to kill him,\r\nand that none but a coward would kill a prisoner; that brave soldiers\r\nwere always kind to women and children. He said it was false that they\r\ngave a bounty for scalps. True, the Indians did commit cruelties, but\r\nthey were not countenanced in the least by the whites. E.S.\"\r\n\r\n\"N.B.--To this last statement of Mrs. Spohn's it may be added that it is\r\nalso true that the Indians were first employed by the Revolutionists\r\nagainst the Loyalists, before they were employed by the latter against\r\nthe former. The attempt to enlist the Indians in the contest was first\r\nmade by the Revolutionists. Of this the most conclusive evidence can be\r\nadduced.\r\n\r\n\"E.R.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: This must be the grandfather of General W.

It was\r\noriginally regarded as a part of Cabot's discovery of Terra Nova, and as\r\nsuch claimed by the English Government, and was afterwards comprehended\r\nwithin the boundary of a large portion of America, called North\r\nVirginia. In the wars between France and England this country changed\r\nmasters several times; but in 1710 Nova Scotia was again re-conquered by\r\nthe forces of her Britannic Majesty Queen Anne, sent from New England,\r\nunder the command of General Nicholson; and by the Treaty of Utrecht, in\r\n1712, it was finally ceded and secured to Great Britain, and has ever\r\nsince continued in her possession.[141]\r\n\r\n\"There were originally three sorts of government established by the\r\nEnglish on the continent of America: Charter Governments, such as those\r\nof Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut; Proprietary\r\nGovernments, as Pennsylvania and Maryland; and Royal Government, as\r\nNova Scotia. A Royal Government is immediately dependent upon the Crown,\r\nand the King appoints the Governor and officers of State, and the people\r\nonly elect the representatives, as in England.\"[142]\r\n\r\n\"Peace was declared between France and England the 8th of November,\r\n1762; and by the treaty which followed, all the French possessions in\r\nCanada, with Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and the islands in the Gulf of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, were ceded to Great Britain. In the year 1764, the\r\nIsland of St. John, named Prince Edward Island in 1799, in honour of the\r\nDuke of Kent, was annexed to Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n\"Of Acadia, and accordingly of Nova Scotia, during its early government\r\nby the English, the province now known as New Brunswick formed a part,\r\nand to the colony was added, in 1758, the Island of Cape Breton, then\r\nfinally taken from the French. In the same year the military rule which\r\nhad prevailed was exchanged for a regular Constitution, in which a\r\nGovernor, representing the British Crown, presided over a Legislative\r\nCouncil and a House of Assembly modelled to some extent from the two\r\nestates of the English Parliament.\"[143]\r\n\r\nThe first Assembly of Nova Scotia met on the 7th of October, 1758, at\r\nHalifax, and elected Robert Sanderson as Speaker. A number of laws\r\npassed by the Governor and Council were passed with slight alterations;\r\nand the Assembly, on the question being put whether any money should be\r\npaid them for their services, unanimously resolved that the members\r\nshould serve without any remuneration that session. (This was repealed\r\nby the members of the next elected Assembly.) The usual Speech from the\r\nThrone was made, and a complimentary address was moved in reply; and the\r\nGovernor and his new Assembly got on better together than he had\r\nexpected.[144]\r\n\r\n\"On October 19th, 1760, Governor Lawrence died from inflammation of the\r\nlungs, brought on by a cold taken at a ball at the Government House. He\r\nwas deeply mourned by the colony, and his loss was severely felt. He was\r\naccorded a public funeral, and the Legislature caused a monument to be\r\nerected to his memory in St. Paul's Church, Halifax, as a mark of their\r\nsense of the many important services he had rendered the province. He\r\nwas a wise and impartial administrator, and zealous and indefatigable in\r\nhis endeavours for the public good; even his opposition to calling a\r\nGeneral Assembly made him few enemies, and his strongest opponent in the\r\nmatter, Chief Justice Belcher, who succeeded him in the administration,\r\nremained on good terms with him.\"[145]\r\n\r\nIn the same month that Governor Lawrence died, occurred the death of\r\nGeorge the Second, in consequence of which the first House of Assembly\r\nof Nova Scotia was dissolved, and a new election, with some changes in\r\nthe electoral districts, took place. The first meeting of the new\r\nAssembly was held the 1st of July, 1761, and the members of the House\r\nagain agreed to give their services gratuitously. From the death of\r\nGovernor Lawrence to the close of the American Revolution in 1783, there\r\nwere ten governors and lieutenant-governors of Nova Scotia, under whose\r\nadministration the colony was quiet and prosperous, though there was\r\nlittle increase in the population (until the influx of the U.E.\r\nLoyalists), and domestic manufactures were discouraged in the interests\r\nof English manufacturers.[146]\r\n\r\nDown to the year 1783, at the close of the American revolutionary war,\r\nthe population of Nova Scotia amounted to only a few thousand; but in\r\nthe following year, by the forced exodus of the Loyalists from the\r\nUnited States, the population more than doubled. \"Even before\r\nhostilities began, a number of loyal families emigrated from Boston, and\r\nsettled on the River St. John, founding the town of Parrtown, now St\r\nJohn, N.B. They found the climate and soil both much better than they\r\nhad expected; and the colony soon began to thrive apace. Settlements\r\nwere made at Oromocto, where a fort was built, and one bold explorer\r\npenetrated as far as the present site of Fredericton, and cleared a farm\r\nthere for himself. These emigrants numbered about 500, and the district\r\nthey settled in was made the county of Sunbury. This, however, was only\r\nthe advance guard of the immense army of emigrants which was to be\r\nattracted to the colony at the close of the war, and which was destined\r\nto play so important a part in the history of the Maritime Province. The\r\nexodus of the Loyalists from New England commenced immediately after the\r\nopening of negotiations for peace in November, 1782; for so bitter was\r\nthe action of the different State Legislatures against them that Sir Guy\r\nCarleton (afterwards Lord Dorchester) could not await the action of\r\nParliament, but took upon himself to commence their removal to Nova\r\nScotia. On the 18th of May, 1783, the ships bearing the first instalment\r\nof Loyalist emigrants arrived at Navy Island, and during the summer they\r\ncontinued to arrive, until about 5,000 had settled between Parrtown (St.\r\nJohn) and St. Anne's. The peninsula now occupied by the city of St. John\r\nwas then almost a wilderness, covered with shrubs, scrubby spruce, and\r\nmarsh. Large numbers of emigrants also arrived at Annapolis, Port\r\nRoseway, and other points; and Governor Parr, in a letter to Lord North\r\nin September, 1783, estimates the whole number that had arrived in Nova\r\nScotia and the island of St. John (Prince Edward's Island) at 13,000.\r\n\r\n\"These emigrants included all classes--disbanded soldiers, lawyers,\r\nclergymen, merchants, farmers, and mechanics; all in indigent\r\ncircumstances, but willing to build up their own fortunes, and those of\r\nthe land of their adoption, by honest labour and industry.\"[147]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: General Description of Nova Scotia.

The question was\r\nreferred to the Attorney and Solicitor-General of England, who decided\r\nthat the Governor and Council alone had not the right to make laws, and\r\nthat any laws so made were unconstitutional. The Lords of Trade\r\n_advised_ the Governor (Lawrence) to convene an Assembly without delay,\r\nbut he objected to it as needless and impracticable; when the Lord of\r\nTrade replied sharply, that he knew their desires on the subject; and as\r\nhe did not seem disposed to gratify them, they were obliged to _order\r\nhim to do so_; adding, that they knew that many had left the province\r\nand gone to other colonies on account of the discontent at the delay of\r\ncalling an Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to these instructions, Governor Lawrence brought the\r\nsubject before his Council the 20th of May, 1758, and a resolution\r\n(prepared by Chief Justice Belcher the year before) was passed, to the\r\neffect \"That a House of Representatives of the inhabitants of this\r\nprovince be a civil Legislature thereof, in conjunction with the\r\nGovernor for the time being, and the Council; that the first House shall\r\nbe known as the General Assembly, and shall consist of sixteen members,\r\nto be elected by the province at large--four by the township of Halifax,\r\nand two by the township of Lunenburg; and that as soon as any other\r\ntownship which might be erected had fifty electors (freeholders), it\r\nshould be entitled to elect two representatives to the Assembly, as well\r\nas having the right of voting for representatives for the Province at\r\nlarge. Eleven members besides the Speaker were to form a quorum.\"\r\n(Tuttle's History of the Dominion of Canada, Chap, li., pp. 238, 239.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _Ib._, p. 239.\r\n\r\n\"Lawrence was an active and able officer, and paid great attention to\r\ndeveloping the resources of the province and promoting the welfare of\r\nthe people. He opposed the Government scheme of making the colony a\r\nmilitary settlement, and was permitted to invite a more desirable class\r\nof emigrants, farmers, mechanics, etc. A proclamation was issued, and\r\ninquiry soon followed as to the inducements offered to settlers. The\r\nterms were liberal. The townships were laid out at twelve miles square,\r\nor one hundred thousand acres each; and each settler was entitled to one\r\nhundred acres for himself, and fifty acres for every member of his\r\nfamily, on condition that he cultivated the land within thirty years;\r\nand each township was to have the right to send two members to the\r\nLegislature as soon as it contained fifty families. Agents from parties\r\nin Connecticut and Rhode Island visited Halifax in 1759, with a view to\r\nemigration, and selected Minas, Chignecto, and Cobequid, which had\r\nformerly been settled by the Acadians, as sites for townships.\r\nEmigration soon set in steadily towards the province; six vessels, with\r\ntwo hundred settlers, arrived from Boston; four schooners, with one\r\nhundred, came from Rhode Island; New London and Plymouth furnished two\r\nhundred and eighty; and three hundred came from Ireland, under the\r\nmanagement of Alexander McNutt.\"--_Ib._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Tuttle's History of the Dominion of Canada, Chap, li., p.\r\n239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Governor Francklin wrote to the Earl of Shelburne, in\r\n1766, that \"The country, in general, work up for their own use, into\r\nstockings and a stuff called home-spun, what little wool their few sheep\r\nproduce; and they also make part of their coarse linen from the flax\r\nthey produce.\"--\"I cannot omit representing to your lordship on this\r\noccasion, _that this Government has at no time given encouragement to\r\nmanufactures which could interfere with those of Great Britain_, nor has\r\nthere been the least appearance of any association of private persons\r\nfor that purpose.\"--\"It may be also proper to observe to your lordship,\r\nthat all the inhabitants in this colony are employed either in\r\nhusbandry, fishing, or providing lumber; and that all the manufactures\r\nfor their clothing, and the utensils for farming and fishing, are made\r\nin Great Britain.\" (Tuttle, Chap. lxvi, p. 325.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Tuttle's History of the Dominion of Canada, Chap. lxvi.,\r\np. 327.\r\n\r\n\"The Loyalists who settled at the St. John River did not agree very well\r\nwith the original settlers. They grew angry with the Governor because\r\ntheir grants of land had not been surveyed. He in turn charged them with\r\nrefusing to assist in the surveys, by acting as chainmen, unless they\r\nwere well paid for it. Then they demanded additional representation in\r\nthe Assembly. Nova Scotia was then divided into eight counties, and\r\nthere were thirty-six representatives in the Assembly, the districts\r\nwhere a number of Loyalists had settled being included in the county of\r\nHalifax. Governor Parr opposed an increase of representation, as his\r\ninstructions forbade his increasing or diminishing the number of\r\nrepresentatives in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\"The Loyalists then began to agitate for a division of the province--a\r\npolicy which was strongly opposed by the Governor, and which gave rise\r\nto much excitement and ill-feeling. Parr went so far as to remove some\r\nof the Loyalists to the other side of the Bay of Fundy, in the hope that\r\nthat would settle the agitation; but it only increased it, and the\r\nLoyalists, who had many warm and influential friends at court, urged a\r\ndivision so earnestly that the Ministry yielded to their wishes, and the\r\nProvince of New Brunswick was created (in 1784), so called out of\r\ncompliment to the reigning family of England. The River Missiquash was\r\nconstituted the boundary line between the two provinces, and the\r\nseparation took place in the fall of 1784, and the first Governor of New\r\nBrunswick, Colonel Thomas Carleton (brother of Lord Dorchester), arrived\r\nat St. John on the 21st of November. In the same year Cape Breton was\r\nmade a separate colony[148]; and as the Island of St. John (Prince\r\nEdward Island) had been separated from Nova Scotia in 1770, there were\r\nnow four separate governments in what at present constitute the Maritime\r\nProvinces.\" (Tuttle's History of the Dominion of Canada, Chap. lxvi.,\r\npp. 328, 329.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: In 1829, Cape Breton was restored to Nova Scotia, of\r\nwhich it now forms a part.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nNEW BRUNSWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of New Brunswick at the time of its separation from Nova\r\nScotia, in 1784, was about 12,000. The governments of both provinces\r\nwere similarly constituted--a Governor, an Executive and Legislative\r\nCouncil, members of the latter appointed by the Crown for life, and an\r\nAssembly or House of Commons, elected periodically by the freeholders:\r\nand both provinces were prosperous and contented for many years under\r\nsuccessive governors, who seemed to have ruled impartially, and for the\r\nbest interests of the people, though with narrower views of free\r\ngovernment than those which obtained at a later period. The Loyalists\r\nnot only obtained the establishment of New Brunswick as a province, but\r\nconstituted the principal members of its Legislature, the officers of\r\nits government, and founders of its institutions; and the chief public\r\nmen of the province have been from that day to this either U.E.\r\nLoyalists or their descendants.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Archer, in his excellent _History of Canada for the Use of\r\nSchools_, prescribed by the Board of Education for New Brunswick, gives\r\nthe following account of the formation of the government of that\r\nprovince, and its founders:\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday, the 21st of November, 1784, Colonel _Thomas Carleton_\r\n(brother to Sir _Guy Carleton_), the first Governor of New Brunswick,\r\narrived in St. John harbour and landed at Reed's Point. He had commanded\r\na regiment during the revolutionary war, and was much esteemed by his\r\nMajesty's exiled Loyalists. The province was formally proclaimed the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n\"The government of New Brunswick consisted of a Governor and a Council\r\nthat united both executive and legislative functions, and a House of\r\nAssembly of twenty-six representatives. The Council was composed of\r\ntwelve members. They were men of great talent, and had occupied before\r\nthe war positions of influence in their native States. Chief Justice\r\n_Ludlow_ had been a judge of the Supreme Court of New York; _James\r\nPutman_ was considered one of the ablest lawyers in all America; the\r\nRev. and Hon. _Jonathan Odell_, first Provincial Secretary, had acted as\r\nchaplain in the Royal army, practised physic and written political\r\npoetry; Judge _Joshua Upham_, a graduate of Harvard, abandoned the Bar\r\nduring the war, and became a colonel of dragoons; Judge _Israel Allen_\r\nhad been colonel of a New Jersey Volunteer corps, and lost an estate in\r\nPennsylvania through his devotion to the Loyalist cause; Judge _Edward\r\nWinslow_, nephew of Colonel _John Winslow_, who executed the decree that\r\nexpelled the Acadians from Nova Scotia, had attained the rank of colonel\r\nin the Royal army; _Beverley Robinson_ had raised and commanded the\r\nLoyal American Regiment, and had lost great estates on Hudson river;\r\n_Gabriel G. Ludlow_ had commanded a battalion of Maryland Volunteers;\r\n_Daniel Bliss_ had been a commissary of the Royal army; _Elijah Willard_\r\nhad taken no active part in the war; _William Hagen_ and _Guildford\r\nStudholme_ were settled in the province before the landing of the\r\nLoyalists; Judge _John Saunders_, of a cavalier family in Virginia, had\r\nbeen captain in the Queen's Rangers, under Colonel Simcoe, and had\r\nafterwards entered the Temple and studied law in London. He was\r\nappointed to the Council after the death of Judge Putman. The government\r\nof the young province was governed with very few changes for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"The town and district of Parr was incorporated in 1785, and became the\r\ncity of _St. John_. It was the first, and long continued to be the only\r\nincorporated town in British America. It was governed by a mayor and a\r\nboard of six aldermen and six assistants. The first two sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly (1786-87) met in St. John. On meeting the Legislature\r\nat its first session, Governor Carleton expressed his satisfaction at\r\nseeing the endeavours of his Majesty to procure for the inhabitants the\r\nprotection of a free government in so fair a way of being finally\r\nsuccessful. He spoke of the peculiar munificence which had been\r\nextended to New Brunswick--the asylum of loyalty--and all the\r\nneighbouring States; and expressed his conviction that the people could\r\nnot show their gratitude in a more becoming manner than by promoting\r\nsobriety, industry, and religion; by discouraging all factious and party\r\ndistinctions, and by inculcating the utmost harmony between the\r\nnewly-arrived Loyalists and the subjects formerly settled in the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n\"Two years afterwards (1788), the seat of government was removed to St.\r\nAnne's Point, Fredericton, which was considered the most central\r\nposition in the province. It is said that Fredericton was chosen to be\r\nthe seat of government because Albany, the seat of the Legislature of\r\nNew York (from which State the great body of the Loyalists came), is\r\nsituated many miles up the River Hudson, and is thus removed from the\r\ndistracting bustle, the factious and corrupting influences of the great\r\ncommercial metropolis at its mouth.\"[149]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Chap. xxvi., pp. 260-262.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prince Edward Island_ was first called by the French St. John's Island,\r\non account of the day on which the French landed on it; but in 1799 its\r\nname was changed, and it was called Prince Edward's Island in honour of\r\nthe Duke of Kent, (William Edward) afterward William IV. After the close\r\nof the American Revolution in 1783, a considerable number of the exiled\r\nLoyalists went to Prince Edward's Island and became merchants and\r\ncultivators of the soil.\r\n\r\n\"In 1763 the island was incorporated with Nova Scotia; but in 1770 it\r\nwas made a separate province, in fulfilment of a curious plan of\r\ncivilization. It was parcelled out in sixty-seven townships, and these\r\nwere distributed by lottery among the creditors of the English\r\nGovernment, each of whom was bound to lodge a settler on every lot of\r\ntwo hundred acres that fell to him. The experiment was not at first very\r\nsuccessful, but gradually the shares passed from the original\r\nspeculators to men who knew how to use the rich soil and usually healthy\r\nclimate of the island.\"[150]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: Bourne's \"Our Colonies and Emigration,\" Chap. viii., p.\r\n105.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nLOWER CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lower Canada_ was first possessed by the French, and under the rule of\r\nFrance the government was purely despotic, though not cruel or harsh. On\r\nthe conquest of Lower Canada in 1759, and its final ceding to England by\r\nthe Treaty of Paris, 1763, a military government was instituted, which\r\ncontinued until 1774, when the famous \"Quebec Act\" was passed by the\r\nImperial Parliament, known as the 14th George the Third, Chapter 83; or\r\nas \"the Quebec Act\"--it was introduced into the House of Lords on the\r\n2nd of May, 1774--\"for Making more Efficient Provision for the Province\r\nof Quebec.\" By the provisions of this famous Act, the boundaries of the\r\nprovince of Quebec were extended from Labrador to the Mississippi,\r\nembracing in one province the territory of Canada, together with all the\r\ncountry north-west of the Ohio to the head of Lake Superior and the\r\nMississippi, and consolidating all authority over this boundless region\r\nin the hands of a Governor and Council of not less than seventeen or\r\nmore than twenty-three members, with power to pass ordinances for the\r\npeace, welfare, and good government of the province. At the close of the\r\nwar between England and France by the Peace of Paris, 1763, English\r\nemigration was invited to Lower Canada, with the promise, by Royal\r\nProclamation, of _representative government_, as in the other colonies.\r\nThat promise, however, was not fulfilled by the Act of 1774; but the\r\nCatholics were not displeased that the promise of a Representative\r\nAssembly was not kept, as a Representative Assembly, to which none but\r\nProtestants could at that time be chosen, was less acceptable to them\r\nthan the despotic rule of a Governor and Council nominated by the Crown.\r\nThe Quebec Act authorized the Crown to confer places of honour and\r\nbusiness upon Catholics. The owners of estates were further gratified by\r\nthe restoration of the French system of law. The English emigrants might\r\ncomplain of the want of jury trials in civil processes, but the French\r\nCanadians were grateful for relief from statutes which they did not\r\ncomprehend. The nobility of New France, who were accustomed to arms,\r\nwere still further conciliated by the proposal to enrol Canadian\r\nbattalions, in which they could hold commissions on equal terms with\r\nEnglish officers. The great dependence of the Crown, however, was on the\r\nclergy. The capitulation of New France had guaranteed to them freedom of\r\npublic worship, but the laws for their support were held to be no longer\r\nvalid. By the Quebec Act they were confirmed in the possession of their\r\nancient churches and their revenues; so that the Roman Catholic worship\r\nwas as effectually established in Canada as the Presbyterian Church in\r\nScotland.[151]\r\n\r\nThis Act encountered very strong opposition both in England and America.\r\nThe Mayor, Aldermen, and Council of the city of London presented a\r\npetition to the King against the Bill, praying his Majesty not to sign\r\nit. In that long and ably drawn up petition, occur the following words:\r\n\r\n\"We beg leave to observe that the English law, and that wonderful effort\r\nof human wisdom, the trial by jury, are not admitted by this Bill in any\r\ncivil cases, and the French law of Canada is imposed on all the\r\ninhabitants of that extensive province, by which both the persons and\r\nproperties of very many of your Majesty's subjects are rendered insecure\r\nand precarious. We humbly conceive that this Bill, if passed into a law,\r\nwill be contrary not only with the compact entered into with the various\r\nsettlers of the Reformed religion, who were invited into the said\r\nprovince under the sacred promise of enjoying the benefit of the laws of\r\nyour realm of England, but likewise repugnant to your Royal Proclamation\r\nof the 7th of October, 1763, for the speedy settlement of the said new\r\ngovernment. * * That the whole legislative power of the province is\r\nvested in persons to be wholly appointed by your Majesty, and removable\r\nat your pleasure, which we apprehend to be repugnant to the leading\r\nprinciples of this free Constitution, by which alone your Majesty now\r\nholds, or legally can hold, the Imperial Crown of these realms.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons the Bill was strongly opposed by Messrs. Fox,\r\nBurke, Townsend and others, chiefly on the ground of its\r\nunconstitutionality, and every effort was made to amend it, but without\r\nsuccess. The Bill was finally passed by a vote of 56 to 20.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords, the Bill was vehemently opposed by the Earl of\r\nChatham, who protested against it \"as a most cruel, oppressive, and\r\nodious measure, tearing up justice and every good principle by the\r\nroots,\" and \"destructive of that liberty which ought to be the\r\ngroundwork of every constitution.\" The Bill, however, passed the Lords\r\nby a vote of 26 to 7, and received the royal assent on the prorogation\r\nof Parliament, the 22nd of June, the King stating in regard to it that\r\n\"it was founded on the clearest principles of justice and humanity, and\r\nwould, he doubted not, have the best effect in quieting the minds and\r\npromoting the happiness of his Canadian subjects.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling against the Act was intense both in England and the\r\ncolonies, regarding it as a type of Imperial legislation for the\r\ncolonies. \"The strongest excitement prevailed in England for some months\r\nafter the passing of the Act; and the papers were filled with little\r\nelse than letters and remarks upon it.\" The British Loyalist settlers in\r\nCanada were indignant, and meetings were held in Quebec and Montreal, at\r\nwhich strong resolutions were passed, and petitions unanimously signed\r\nto the King, Lords and Commons, praying for the repeal of the Act, and\r\nforwarded to England.\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th of May, 1775, Lord Camden moved in the House of Lords for\r\nthe repeal of the Act, but the motion was defeated by a vote of 88 to\r\n28.\" A similar motion by Sir George Saville, in the Commons, was\r\nlikewise defeated by a vote of 174 to 86.[152] The feeling of the\r\nLoyalists throughout Canada was very strong against this Act; and its\r\noperations gave no satisfaction to any party.[153]\r\n\r\nFrom the prevalent dissatisfaction among all parties in Canada with the\r\nQuebec Act of 1774, the Imperial Government having, in 1788, sanctioned\r\nordinances to restore the _Habeas Corpus_ Act, and the _trial by jury_\r\nin civil cases, and obtained full and minute information as to the\r\ninternal state of Canada, a Bill was prepared and introduced into the\r\nHouse of Commons by Mr. Pitt, pursuant to a message from the King, on\r\nthe 4th of March, 1791, establishing a representative government for\r\nCanada, after the model as far as possible of the British Constitution.\r\nThis Act is sometimes called the \"Grenville Act,\" having been chiefly\r\nprepared by Grenville, and conducted by him through the House of Lords;\r\nit is sometimes called the \"Pitt Act,\" having been introduced and\r\ncarried through the House of Commons by Pitt; but it is generally known\r\nin Canada as the Constitutional Act, 31 George III., Chapter 31--the Act\r\nwhich gave to Canada its first constitutional government, and under the\r\nprovisions of which Canada was governed for fifty years, until the union\r\nof the two Canadas in 1841.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt in introducing his Bill stated \"that the division of the\r\nprovince into Upper and Lower Canada, he hoped would put an end to the\r\ncompetition between the old French inhabitants and the new settlers from\r\nBritain and the British colonies. This division he trusted would be made\r\nin such a manner as to give each a majority in their own particular\r\npart; although it could not be expected to draw a complete line of\r\nseparation. Any inconvenience, however, to be apprehended from ancient\r\nCanadians being included in the one or British settlers in the other,\r\nwould be averted by a local Legislature to be established in each.\r\n\r\n\"In imitation of the Constitution of the mother country, he would\r\npropose a Legislative Council and House of Assembly for each; the\r\nAssembly to be constituted in the usual manner, and the members of the\r\nCouncil to be for life; reserving to his Majesty to annex to certain\r\nhonours an hereditary right of sitting in Council (a power never\r\nexercised). All laws and ordinances of the province to remain in force\r\ntill altered by the new Legislature. The _Habeas Corpus_ Act was already\r\nlaw by an ordinance of the province, and was to be continued as a\r\nfundamental principle of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"It was further meant to make a provision for a Protestant clergy in\r\nboth divisions, by an allotment of lands in proportion to those already\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\"The tenures were to be settled in Lower Canada by the local\r\nLegislature. In Upper Canada, the settlers being chiefly British, the\r\ntenures were to be soccage tenures.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent any such dispute as that which separated the thirteen\r\ncolonies from the mother country, it was provided that the British\r\nParliament should impose no taxes but such as might be necessary for the\r\nregulation of trade and commerce; and to guard against the abuse of this\r\npower, such taxes were to be levied and disposed of by the Legislature\r\nof each division.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bill was opposed in the House of Commons by Mr. Fox and others, upon\r\nthe grounds that it created two provinces and two Legislatures, and made\r\nthe members of the Legislative Councils nominees of the Crown for life,\r\ninstead of leaving their election to the people; but the Bill was\r\nsupported by Edmund Burke, who, with Fox, had voted side by side against\r\nthe Quebec Act of 1774, but who opposed each other on the Canada Bill of\r\n1791.[154]\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt, in reply to the objection of Mr. Fox and others, stated among\r\nother things, \"That the population of _Upper Canada_ amounted to only\r\n10,000 inhabitants, and that of _Lower Canada_ to not more than\r\n100,000.\"[155]\r\n\r\nWith such preparation and explanations the Bill passed both Houses of\r\nParliament and received the royal assent, conferring on Canada a new\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThis Act separated the province of Quebec into two provinces, _Upper_\r\nand _Lower Canada_, the division line between which was the River\r\nOttawa.\r\n\r\nFor each province a Legislature was established consisting of a\r\n_Governor_, a _Legislative Council_ and _House of Assembly_--in\r\nimitation of the Constitution of England; for the Governor was to\r\nrepresent the Sovereign, the Legislative Council the House of Lords, and\r\nthe Assembly the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legislative Council were to be discreet persons,\r\nappointed by Royal authority for life; the members of the Assemblies\r\nwere to be chosen by the people, once in four years, unless oftener\r\ncalled upon, by dissolution, to elect new members.\r\n\r\nThe Act was to come in force not later than the 31st of December, 1791;\r\nand the date of meeting of the new Legislature was not to be later than\r\nthe 31st December, 1792.\r\n\r\nThus in fulfilment of a promise made in a Royal Proclamation in 1763,\r\nCanada obtained a _representative_ form of government in 1791.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that _the representative_ form of government was\r\nobtained both for _Nova Scotia_ and _New Brunswick_ by the\r\nrepresentation and influence of the _United Empire Loyalists_; it was so\r\nin Canada. Thus are we indebted to the _United Empire Loyalists_ not\r\nonly for our unity with the British empire, but for the original\r\nconstitution of representative government which, with enlarged\r\napplication, is the basis of that free government which now prevails\r\nthroughout all the provinces of the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF LOWER CANADA.\r\n\r\nIn 1786, Lord Dorchester had been appointed Governor of Canada and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the British forces in North America.[156] But he\r\nleft for England in August, 1791, on a year's leave, and in his absence\r\nthe administration of the Government was entrusted to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, General Alured Clarke, a retired British officer.\r\nThe elections took place in June, 1792, and were in some instances\r\nwarmly contested. Lower Canada had been divided into twenty-one\r\ncounties, eighteen of which elected two members each, and three--the\r\ncounties of Gaspé, Bedford, and Orleans--returned one member each; the\r\ncities of Quebec and Montreal were each represented by four members, and\r\nThree Rivers by two. Of the fifty members elected to the first House of\r\nAssembly, fifteen were of British origin, and thirty-five were of French\r\norigin.[157]\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Council consisted of fifteen members.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of October, the Provincial Parliament was commanded to meet\r\nat Quebec the 17th of December, 1792, for the actual despatch of\r\nbusiness. On the meeting of the Legislative Council that day, the Hon.\r\nChief Justice William Smith was appointed Speaker. The House of Assembly\r\ndid not agree upon the election of Speaker on the first day--the French\r\nand English-speaking members advocating respectively the election of a\r\nSpeaker of their own language; but at length Mr. J.A. Panet was elected\r\nby a large majority--he speaking both languages with equal\r\nfluency.[158]\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor made a speech expressing the solicitude and\r\nconsideration of the King for his Canadian subjects, in recommending to\r\nhis Parliament such a change in their colonial government as\r\ncircumstances might require and admit. \"On a day like this,\" said his\r\nExcellency, \"signalized by the commencement in this country of that form\r\nof government which has raised the kingdom to which it is subordinate to\r\nthe highest elevation, it is impossible not to feel emotions difficult\r\nto be expressed.\r\n\r\n\"To give an opportunity for your loyal and grateful acknowledgments to\r\nhis Majesty is one of my motives for calling you together, and that debt\r\ndischarged, your Council will doubtless be next employed for enacting\r\nthe laws necessary to confirm and augment the property of your country.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor concluded in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Great Britain being happily at peace with all the world, and I hope\r\nwithout apprehension of its interruption, the present moment must be\r\nmost fit and urgent for all those arrangements best made at a season of\r\ntranquillity, and falling within the sphere of our trust. The conviction\r\nI feel of your disposition to cultivate that harmony amongst yourselves\r\nand each branch of the Legislature, which is always essential to the\r\npublic good and private satisfaction, makes it unnecessary for me to\r\nenlarge upon this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Such objects as it may become my duty to recommend to your\r\nconsideration, shall be occasionally communicated to you by message.\"\r\n\r\nThe address of the Assembly in answer to his Excellency's speech\r\nbreathed a spirit of grateful affection and loyalty. After expressing\r\ntheir warmest gratitude to the King and Parliament of Great Britain, \"in\r\ngranting to his Majesty's subjects in this province a new and liberal\r\nConstitution for their colonial government,\" the Assembly proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"We cannot express the emotions which arose in our breasts, on that\r\never-memorable day when we entered on the enjoyment of a Constitution\r\nassimilated to that form of government which has carried the glory of\r\nour mother country to the highest elevation. * *\r\n\r\n\"It is an unparalleled happiness for us to have an opportunity of\r\npresenting to his Majesty our loyal thanks, and of expressing to him our\r\ngratitude; such homage is the language of our hearts, and it is due from\r\nus, for all the favours with which we have been loaded. That duty\r\nfulfilled, we will turn our attention with most ardent zeal to framing\r\nsuch laws as may tend to the prosperity and advantage of our country.\r\n\r\n\"We hear with pleasure that Great Britain is at peace with all the\r\nworld, and we consider this as the most favourable time for the\r\nconsideration of the objects that fall within the sphere of our charge,\r\nto cultivate harmony among ourselves and each branch of the Legislature;\r\nthat it is a condition essentially necessary to the public good and our\r\nown private satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"We will at all times give the most speedy and deliberate consideration\r\nto such messages as we may receive from your Excellency.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout this address of the Assembly there is the true ring of manly\r\nsincerity, and heartfelt loyalty to the Throne and to the unity of the\r\nempire. The Governor soon sent several messages to the Assembly,\r\nsubmitting, by command of the King, various subjects for their\r\nconsideration, for which he received their cordial thanks, and\r\nassurances that the subjects submitted would receive their best\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThere was one subject of discussion which created much feeling and\r\nprotracted debate--namely, the language in which the proceedings of the\r\nAssembly should be conducted, recorded, and published; but the rising\r\nstorm was allayed and unity restored by the decision to leave each\r\nmember at liberty to address the House in French or English at his\r\npleasure--to have all motions, before being put to the House, read in\r\nboth languages, and the record of the proceedings kept and published in\r\nboth languages--a happy arrangement, which has been continued to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe House of Assembly, in their reply to the opening speech of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, expressed their intention of presenting their\r\nheartfelt thanks to his Majesty for the new and liberal Constitution\r\nconferred upon them. That truly loyal address was as follows, and does\r\nlasting honour to its authors and the Imperial Government:\r\n\r\n\"We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the representatives\r\nof Lower Canada, met in Assembly for the first time under our new\r\nConstitution, humbly approach the Throne, to express to your most\r\ngracious Majesty our sentiments of gratitude and joy on the happy change\r\nwhich has taken place in the forms of our government.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution which it hath pleased your Majesty and Parliament to\r\ngive us, modelled upon that of Great Britain--a Constitution which has\r\ncarried the empire to the highest pitch of glory and prosperity--assures\r\nto this colony the most solid advantages, and will for ever attach it to\r\nthe parent State.\r\n\r\n\"Now, partaking without distinction the benefits of a government which\r\nprotects all equally, we offer our thanks to Divine Providence for the\r\nhappiness prepared for us. Our prayers are for the general prosperity of\r\nthe nation of which we make a part, and for the preservation and\r\nfelicity of our august and virtuous Sovereign.\r\n\r\n\"May it please your Majesty to receive favourably our respectful homage,\r\nand permit us anew to express our loyalty and attachment.\r\n\r\n\"May it please your Majesty and Parliament to receive our most humble\r\nthanks for the favour conferred upon this colony.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the heartfelt wishes of the representatives of the people of\r\nLower Canada.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the auspicious circumstances and cordiality of feeling\r\nattendant upon the inauguration of constitutional government in Lower\r\nCanada. The session continued upwards of four months--from December\r\nuntil May--during which time a great many subjects were introduced\r\nrespecting expenses and revenues, salaries of officers, affairs\r\nappertaining to legislation, to the militia, to the administration of\r\njustice, and the welfare of the country; but only eight _Bills_ were\r\npassed, and which were assented to in the King's name by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, who prorogued the Legislature on the 9th of May,\r\n1793, with a short and complimentary speech.\r\n\r\nIt is not my object to narrate in detail the legislation or proceedings\r\nof any of the colonies, except in so far as may be necessary to\r\nillustrate the history of _the Loyalists of America_. A most impressive\r\nillustration of true loyalty was given by the Assembly of Lower Canada\r\nbefore the close of its first session. In the Lieutenant-Governor's\r\nspeech at the opening of the session, he informed the Legislature that\r\nGreat Britain was at peace with all the world, and that there was no\r\napprehension of its interruption. But before the close of the session\r\nintelligence was received at Quebec that the revolutionary authorities\r\nof France had declared war against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of April, 1793, the Lieutenant-Governor sent a message to\r\nthe Assembly, informing them that he had received a letter from the\r\nSecretary of State, of the 9th of February previous, stating that \"the\r\npersons exercising the supreme authority in France had declared war\r\nagainst his Majesty.\"[159]\r\n\r\nThe answer to the message breathes the _Loyalists'_ spirit. They thanked\r\nhis Excellency for his message, and assured him that \"it was with horror\r\nthey had heard that the most atrocious act which ever disgraced society\r\nhad been perpetrated in France (alluding to the recent decapitation of\r\nthe unfortunate Louis XVI.), and that it was with concern and\r\nindignation they now learned that the persons exercising the supreme\r\nauthority there had declared war against his Majesty.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty's faithful subjects earnestly pray that his arms may be\r\ncrowned with such signal success over his enemies as shall speedily\r\nbring about a peace honourable, safe, and advantageous to his Majesty\r\nand the empire.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Assembly assured his Excellency that \"the House would\r\nimmediately proceed to a revision of the Militia laws, and if\r\nalterations and amendments were necessary they would make such\r\namendments as should be deemed the most fit and proper to secure and\r\nprotect the province from every insult and injury of his Majesty's\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session, after assenting, on behalf of the King, to\r\nthe eight Bills which had been passed, the Lieutenant-Governor delivered\r\nthe proroguing speech, in which he thanked the Assembly for the diligent\r\nand practical consideration which they had given to the various subjects\r\nwhich had been submitted to them, and the \"further regulations necessary\r\nfor the better organizing and more effectually calling forth the militia\r\nfor the defence of this extensive and valuable country, when our enemies\r\nof any description shall make it necessary.\" His Excellency alluded to\r\nthe war of the rulers of France against England in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, at the first meeting of the Legislature, I congratulated you\r\nupon the flattering prospects which opened to your view and upon the\r\nflourishing and tranquil state of the British empire, then at peace with\r\nall the world. Since that period, I am sorry to find its tranquillity\r\nhas been disturbed by the unjustifiable and unprecedented conduct of the\r\npersons exercising the supreme power in France, who, after deluging\r\ntheir own country with the blood of their fellow-citizens, and imbruing\r\ntheir hands in that of their Sovereign, have forced his Majesty and the\r\nsurrounding nations of Europe into a contest which involves the first\r\ninterests of society. In this situation of public affairs, I reflect\r\nwith peculiar pleasure upon the loyal and faithful attachment of his\r\nMajesty's subjects of this province to his royal person, and to that\r\nform of government we have the happiness to enjoy.\"[160]\r\n\r\nThe second session of the Parliament was summoned by Lord Dorchester\r\nhimself, the 11th of November, 1793.[161] This session lasted seven\r\nmonths and a half, though only six Bills were passed. In his speech at\r\nthe opening of the session, Lord Dorchester recommended the due\r\nadministration of justice, together with the arrangements necessary for\r\nthe defence and safety of the province, as matters of the first\r\nimportance. His Excellency also informed the Assembly that he would\r\norder to be laid before them an account of all the receipts of the\r\nprovincial revenues of the Crown since the division of Upper and Lower\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe purport of his Excellency's speech, and the spirit of the Assembly,\r\nand the relations between the colony and the parent state, may be\r\ninferred from the following cordial and complimentary address of the\r\nAssembly in answer to the Governor's opening speech:\r\n\r\n\"Fully convinced of the happy effects to be derived from a solid and\r\ninvariable administration of justice, and of the indispensable necessity\r\nfor an establishment for assuring the defence and safety of the\r\nprovince, we will lose no time in resuming the consideration of these\r\nimportant subjects, and in making such amendments in the existing laws\r\nas may best protect the persons and property of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"By receiving from your Excellency an account of the receipts of the\r\nprovincial revenues of the Crown, we shall be enabled to deliberate on\r\nthe means by which they may be rendered more productive; and penetrated\r\nwith gratitude to the parent state for having hitherto defrayed the\r\nsurplus expenditure of the province, we flatter ourselves that, in\r\nconsideration of our situation, we shall continue to receive her\r\ngenerous assistance--a hope further strengthened by your Excellency's\r\nintention of not requiring from us any subsidy at present, which\r\nconfirms the benevolence of the mother country.\r\n\r\n\"In the infancy of our Constitution, we perceive the necessity of\r\ngreater circumspection in the formation of laws that may tend to support\r\nand establish it; and also to cultivate amongst the different branches\r\nof the Legislature that cordial harmony and concord so necessary to\r\npromote the measures essential to the happiness and well-being of our\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly bestowed much attention upon the Judicature Bill of the\r\nprevious session, and on the Militia Bill, and brought them to maturity;\r\nalso an Alien Bill was introduced and passed, establishing \"regulations\r\nrespecting aliens and certain subjects of his Majesty, who have resided\r\nin France, coming into this province and residing therein, and for\r\nempowering his Majesty to receive and detain persons charged with or\r\nsuspected of high treason, and for the arrest and commitment of all\r\npersons who may individually, by seditious practices, attempt to disturb\r\nthe government of this province.\"[162]\r\n\r\nIt happened at the commencement of this session that Edward, Duke of\r\nKent, the father of our beloved Queen Victoria, was in Canada, and held\r\nmilitary command of the troops. The day after the assembling of the\r\nLegislature, the Assembly presented him with a most cordial and\r\naffectionate address, as did subsequently the Legislative Council,\r\nclergy, and citizens of Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivers, styling the\r\nprince \"the son of the best of sovereigns.\" The prince delighted all by\r\nhis answers, his amiable manners and exemplary conduct. All were\r\nespecially delighted with his declared disapprobation of the terms _the\r\nKing's old and new subjects; French and English inhabitants_. He said\r\nall were \"the King's Canadian subjects.\"[163]\r\n\r\nLord Dorchester transmitted to the Assembly, on the 29th of April, 1794,\r\na message peculiarly interesting from its being the first financial\r\nstatement laid before the Legislature of Lower Canada. The message\r\ncommences: \"The Governor has given directions for laying before the\r\nHouse of Assembly an account of the provincial revenue of the Crown from\r\nthe commencement of a new Constitution to the 10th of January,\r\n1794.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThe House, by an address, thanked his Excellency for the message and\r\npapers accompanying it; they observed that they saw in it an additional\r\nproof of the paternal solicitude of his Majesty to ease the burdens of\r\nhis subjects, and of his Excellency's anxiety to promote the interests\r\nof this province; and that the magnitude and utility of the objects\r\nrecommended to their consideration could not fail engaging their serious\r\nattention as soon as the important matters now before them, and in a\r\nstate of progression, were accomplished.[165]\r\n\r\nIn closing the session, the 31st of May, 1794, Lord Dorchester assented,\r\nin the King's name, to five Bills, reserving the Judicature Bill for the\r\nroyal pleasure (which was approved and became law the following\r\nDecember), and one for appointing Commissioners to treat with\r\nCommissioners on behalf of Upper Canada, relating to duties and\r\ndrawbacks to be allowed to that province on importations through the\r\nlower province. The closing speech of his Excellency, among other\r\nthings, contained the following words:\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that, on returning to your respective homes, you will\r\nzealously diffuse among all ranks of people those principles of justice,\r\npatriotism, and loyalty which have distinguished your public labours\r\nduring this session, and that you will use your best exertions to find\r\nout and bring to justice those evil-disposed persons who, by\r\ninflammatory discourses, or the spreading of seditious writings,\r\nendeavour to deceive the unwary and disturb the peace and good order of\r\nsociety; and that you will avail yourselves of every opportunity to\r\nconvince your fellow-subjects that the blessings they enjoy under a\r\ntruly free and happy Constitution can be preserved only by a due\r\nobedience to the laws, all breaches of which are the more inexcusable as\r\nthe Constitution itself has provided for the safe and easy repeal or\r\nmodification of such as may not answer the good intentions of the\r\nLegislature.\"\r\n\r\nThe interval between the close of the second and the opening of the\r\nthird session of the Legislature, from the 31st of May, 1794, to 5th of\r\nJanuary, 1795, quiet and contentment prevailed in the province; and the\r\nshort speech of Lord Dorchester (for his speeches were always short and\r\nto the point) at the opening of this third Session was chiefly one of\r\ncongratulation, commendation and suggestion. Among other things he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I shall order to be laid before you a statement of the\r\nprovincial revenues of the Crown for the last year, together with such\r\npart of the expenditure as may enable you to estimate the ways and means\r\nfor the most necessary supplies, in bringing forward which you will keep\r\nin view the advantages of providing for the public exigencies by a\r\nprudent restraint on luxuries, and by regulations which may, at the same\r\ntime, encourage and extend commerce.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, the judges and law officers of the Crown have been directed\r\nto draw up and report their opinion on the subject of your address to me\r\non the 28th of May last\" (this related to the establishment of forms of\r\nproceeding in the courts of justice, and a table of fees to which the\r\ndifferent civil officers, advocates, notaries, and land surveyors should\r\nbe entitled in their respective offices); \"and I have much satisfaction\r\nin perceiving this early disposition on your part to prevent and guard\r\nagainst abuses which might impede the course of justice, or give rise to\r\ncustoms that would establish oppressive demands, and gradually efface\r\nfrom our minds a due sense of their unwarrantable origin.\r\n\r\n\"Your own disinterested conduct in your legislative capacity; your\r\nzealous endeavours to promote a general obedience to the laws, connected\r\nwith a benevolent attention to the interests of the subject, form a\r\nsolid foundation for government, and afford me great hopes that our new\r\nConstitution will be firmly established, and ensure, for ages to come,\r\nthe happiness of the people.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to this speech of Lord Dorchester, Mr. Christie well remarks:\r\n\"The foresight, the rectitude, the wisdom of this most upright man and\r\nvirtuous governor, cannot fail to strike the reader, and command his\r\nrespect and admiration.\"\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the address of the House of Assembly in answer to\r\nthe Governor's speech was equally cordial and assuring, concluding with\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n\"It is highly flattering to us that our conduct in our legislative\r\ncapacity has met with your Excellency's approbation. Being thoroughly\r\nsensible of the happiness we enjoy under the free and liberal\r\nConstitution which has been granted to us by the parent state, under\r\nyour Excellency's prudent and wise administration, we will continue to\r\nexert our most zealous endeavours to promote a general obedience to the\r\nlaws, and to establish that Constitution in such a manner as may ensure\r\nfor ages to come the happiness of the people.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of February, 1795, the Governor sent a message to the\r\nAssembly, transmitting \"the accounts of the provincial scheme of the\r\nCrown from the 6th of January, 1794, to the 5th of January, 1795, also\r\nof the civil expenditure for the same period.\"[166]\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners appointed under the Act of the previous session, to\r\ntreat with Commissioners on behalf of Upper Canada concerning duties and\r\ndrawbacks to be allowed in favour of that province, reported that they\r\nhad met and finally adjusted with them the sum to be reimbursed to Upper\r\nCanada for 1793 and 1794.[167]\r\n\r\nSeveral important Acts were passed this session relating to revenue,\r\ndefraying the charges for the administration, the support of the civil\r\ngovernment, and for other purposes. On the 7th of May, his Excellency\r\nprorogued the Legislature with a speech which contained the following\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I cannot put an end to this session of our Provincial\r\nParliament without expressing my approbation and thanks for that zeal\r\nfor the public welfare which has distinguished all your proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, the cheerfulness with which you\r\nhave granted a supply towards defraying the civil expenditure of the\r\nprovince gives me great satisfaction; the judicious choice you have made\r\nof the means for this purpose, evinces a tender regard for the interests\r\nand condition of this country; and the unanimity in this tribute of\r\ngratitude and attachment to the King's government cannot but be highly\r\npleasing to his Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last session of this Parliament was summoned for the 20th\r\nof November, 1795, and continued until the 7th of May, 1796, during\r\nwhich twelve Bills were passed that received the royal assent. In his\r\nopening speech, his Excellency expressed his \"great satisfaction to\r\nobserve, during the present session, a continuance of the same zealous\r\nattention to their legislative duties, and to the general interests of\r\nthe province, which he had occasion to notice in their former\r\nproceedings.\" His concluding words were:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the House of\r\nAssembly, in expressing my approbation of your proceedings, I must\r\nfurther observe that the unanimity, loyalty, and disinterestedness\r\nmanifested by this first Provincial Parliament of Lower Canada, have\r\nnever been surpassed in any of his Majesty's provincial dominions; and I\r\nfeel convinced that the prosperity and happiness of this country will\r\ncontinue to increase in proportion as succeeding Parliaments shall\r\nfollow your laudable example.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended the first Parliament of Lower Canada; thus was inaugurated\r\nand consolidated its government, which, without the strife of\r\npartizanship or the machinery of party, was pure, just, mild,\r\neconomical, patriotic, and progressive.\r\n\r\nThus also ended, in the course of a few weeks, Lord Dorchester's\r\nconnection with Canada; for having obtained his Majesty's leave of\r\nabsence, he embarked with his family for England the 9th of July, 1796.\r\nHe was far advanced in life; he had been, with few interruptions,\r\nconnected with Canada, as officer, military commander, and governor,\r\nmore than thirty-six years. He was with General Wolfe at the siege and\r\ntaking of Quebec in 1759, where he was wounded; he was colonel of the\r\nGrenadiers, and quartermaster-general of Wolfe's army. In the various\r\ncapacities in which he served, whether as governor or commander-in-chief\r\nor diplomatist, he was equally distinguished for his courage and\r\nprudence, his justice and humanity, as well as for his many social and\r\nprivate virtues.[168]\r\n\r\nHis departure from Canada was a matter of universal regret. Farewell\r\naddresses were presented to him by the citizens of Quebec, Montreal, and\r\nother places--all expressing to him the highest respect and warmest\r\ngratitude for his long and valuable services to Canada. The general\r\nspirit of these addresses may be inferred from the following\r\nexpressions:\r\n\r\n\"Having experienced for many years your lordship's mild and auspicious\r\nadministration of his Majesty's Government, and being aware that during\r\nthat period the resources, prosperity, and happiness of this province\r\nhave increased in a degree almost unequalled, we, the inhabitants of the\r\ncity of Quebec, respectfully request your lordship to accept our sincere\r\nand most grateful thanks and acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n\"The length of your residence in the province; the advantages derived to\r\nour society from the example of private virtues shown by yourself and\r\nyour family; your lordship's uniform prudent and paternal attention,\r\nunder every change of time and circumstance, to the true interests of\r\nhis Majesty's subjects entrusted to your immediate care, and that\r\ngratitude which we feel (and must be permitted to repeat), excite in our\r\nminds the warmest sentiments of personal attachment, of which allow us\r\nto tender you the strongest assurance.\r\n\r\n\"Under these impressions, we view your lordship's intended departure\r\nwith the deepest regret; and submitting to your determination to leave\r\nus with unfeigned reluctance, we entreat you to accept our most sincere\r\nwishes for the future prosperity of yourself and all your family.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Montreal address we have the following expressions of sentiment\r\nand feelings:\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of Montreal, penetrated with gratitude for the\r\nhappiness enjoyed by them under your lordship's administration of the\r\ngovernment of this province during a great number of years, embrace the\r\npresent opportunity of your intended departure for Great Britain to\r\nentreat you to receive their humble acknowledgments and accept their\r\nmost sincere wishes for your health and prosperity, and for that of all\r\nyour family.\r\n\r\n\"The prudence and moderation which distinguished your conduct in the\r\nprovince assured internal peace and tranquillity, and in reflecting\r\ninfinite honour on your lordship, have fully justified the confidence\r\nreposed in you by our august Sovereign, and assured to you the\r\naffections of the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nThe grateful and affectionate answers of Lord Dorchester to both\r\naddresses may be easily conceived. The comparatively happy state of\r\nthings indicated by these addresses continued, with interruptions, for\r\nabout ten years after Lord Dorchester's departure.\r\n\r\nLord Dorchester was succeeded by General Prescott, who became\r\nlieutenant-governor, until he was relieved the 31st of July, 1799, by\r\nthe appointment of Sir Robert S. Milnes, who acted as lieutenant-governor\r\nof the province during the ensuing six years, when the senior Executive\r\nCouncillor, Thomas Dunn, succeeded to the administration of the government\r\nfor two years, until the appointment, in 1807, of Sir James Craig as\r\nlieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief, under whose administration\r\nthe reign of discord and strife of race became predominant, with the\r\nnatural results which in long years afterwards ensued. These matters,\r\nhowever, do not come within the province of my history of the Loyalists\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nBut it is to be observed that though the French had much to complain of,\r\nhaving scarcely any representation in the Legislative Council, none in\r\nthe Executive, and none in the Provincial Board of Education, called the\r\n\"Royal Institution,\" which had the care of education in the\r\nprovince,[169] and therefore had to depend alone upon their own elected\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Assembly for the protection of their\r\nrights and feelings; yet they evinced a loyalty through all these years,\r\nand through the war of 1812-1815, not excelled by the British\r\ninhabitants of Lower Canada, or of any other colony, notwithstanding the\r\nefforts of French and American emissaries to create disaffection in the\r\nprovince. A remarkable illustration of the loyalty of the French in\r\nLower Canada occurred in 1805: \"The horrors of the French revolution had\r\npassed by, but Great Britain and France were still engaged in a\r\ndesperate war. By land, on the continent of Europe, the French, under\r\nNapoleon I., were everywhere victorious against the countries in\r\nalliance with Great Britain. But England by sea was more than a match\r\nfor France; and on October 21st, 1805, won the battle of _Trafalgar_, by\r\nwhich the French naval power was destroyed. The news of this victory\r\nreached Canada early in January, 1806. The Canadians of French origin\r\nimmediately showed that they felt less sympathy for their own race, and\r\nless pride in its military prowess, than gratification at the naval\r\nsuccess of the empire of which they formed a part. They indulged in\r\npatriotic songs, and testified their interest by illuminations and other\r\nmodes of rejoicing.\"[170]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Bancroft, Vol. VII., Chap. xiv., pp. 157, 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: \"The excitement in England and Canada on the passage of\r\nthe Act was, however, only a breeze compared to the storm of indignation\r\nwhich it raised in the thirteen other provinces when the news reached\r\nthem; and there is no doubt but that the passage of this Act was 'the\r\nlast drop' which overflowed the cup of colonial patience, and led\r\ndirectly to the Declaration of Independence.\" (Tuttle's History of the\r\nDominion of Canada, Chap, lix., pp. 295, 296.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: \"The provisions of the Quebec Act dissatisfied all\r\nparties when they came to be executed. The French majority, being\r\nrepresented by less than one-fourth of the number of members in the\r\nCouncil, thought themselves but little better off than when a purely\r\nmilitary government. The English party considered themselves injured\r\nbecause the trial by jury, in civil cases, had been taken away. The\r\nabsence of a representative form of government, and of the privileges of\r\nthe _Habeas Corpus_ Act, made them feel that they were denied the rights\r\nof British subjects.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody being satisfied, and the Governor (Sir Frederick Haldimand,\r\nwhose governorship lasted from 1778 to 1785) being very arbitrary,\r\ndiscontent reigned in the provinces. There were loud complaints, not\r\nonly of the Governor's tyranny, but also that justice was not fairly\r\nadministered by the judges in the course of law.\r\n\r\n\"Many persons, on slight grounds, were thrown into prisons, were sent to\r\nEngland, and at length, 1785, the unpopular Governor demanded his own\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\n\"The English Government saw that steps must be taken to put an end to\r\nthe general discontent. But this could not be done without making such\r\nchanges as might satisfy the increasing English and Protestant\r\npopulation as well as the French and Roman Catholics. Nor could such\r\nchanges be made on the instant, or without due preparation. Accordingly,\r\nin the first instance, _trial by jury_ in civil cases, and the law of\r\n_habeas corpus_, was introduced into the province (in 1788). Next it was\r\ndetermined to procure further and more perfectly reliable information\r\nabout all its internal affairs, and find out, it possible, the best\r\nmodes of removing the causes of complaint.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, as a proof of the desire to deal impartially with the King's\r\nCanadian subjects, it was decided to send out, as governor, one who had\r\nrendered himself acceptable to all classes. This was no other than the\r\npopular Sir Guy Carleton, who had been made a peer with the title of\r\n_Lord Dorchester_, who reached Quebec in October, 1786. During the\r\nsucceeding five years, until 1791, when he again departed (for a short\r\ntime) to England, the Governor did all in his power to mitigate the bad\r\nfeelings growing out of the differences of race, creed and language. In\r\norder to procure for the English Ministers the information they needed\r\nabout the internal affairs of the province, he appointed Committees of\r\nInquiry to inquire into all particulars relating to _commerce,\r\neducation, justice_, the _militia_, and the _tenure_ of _lands_; to make\r\nfull reports upon these; to suggest changes and improvements by which\r\nexisting evils might be remedied.\" (Dr. Miles' School History of Canada,\r\nChap. v., pp. 181, 182.)\r\n\r\nSee also Tuttle's History of the Dominion of Canada, Chap. v., p. 322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: It was the discussion on this Bill which produced the\r\nfirst separation between Fox and Burke. The mind of Burke was excited to\r\nthe highest degree by the principles and horrors of the French\r\nrevolution, and he had frequently denounced it with the full force of\r\nhis lofty eloquence; while Fox had repeatedly expressed his admiration\r\nof the French revolution. When the Canada Bill was discussed in the\r\nHouse of Commons, Burke commenced his speech by a philippic against the\r\nrepublican principles of the revolutionary Government of France; and\r\nconcluded by declaring that if by adhering to the British Constitution\r\nwould cause his friends to desert him, he would risk all, and, as his\r\npublic duty taught him, exclaim in his last words, \"Fly from the French\r\nConstitution!\" Fox said in a low voice, \"There is no loss of friendship,\r\nI hope.\" \"Yes,\" retorted Burke, \"there is a loss of friendship. I know\r\nthe price of my conduct. Our friendship is at an end.\" Such a scene\r\nfollowed as had seldom, if ever, been witnessed in the House of Commons.\r\nMembers were veritably affected by such an open rupture between those\r\ntwo celebrated statesmen and orators. Fox shed tears; and it was some\r\ntime before he could sufficiently command his emotions to reply.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: This was an under-estimate of the population of both\r\nprovinces. Later and reliable authorities estimate the population of\r\nLower Canada in 1791 at 150,000, of whom about 15,000 were British; in\r\n1763 the population of Lower Canada was estimated at 65,000; the\r\npopulation had therefore more than doubled during the twenty-seven years\r\nof English rule. Before 1782, the English-speaking Protestant\r\ninhabitants were very insignificant in number; but after 1782 they\r\nincreased rapidly, and are estimated at upwards of 15,000, and by some\r\nwriters as high as 30,000 in the year 1791. The great majority of them,\r\nbesides, were of classes of people accustomed to think for themselves,\r\nalso officers and disbanded soldiers belonging to the army, and\r\nemigrants from the British Isles, who came to make homes for their\r\nfamilies in Canada. (Miles' School History of Canada, Part II., Chap.\r\nv., pp. 183, 184.)\r\n\r\nIt is stated on the best authorities that 10,000 Loyalist emigrants\r\narrived in what was afterwards designated Upper Canada, during the year\r\n1783; in 1791 the population of Upper Canada is stated to have been\r\n12,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: \"In June, 1786, Sir Guy Carleton, now raised to the\r\npeerage as Lord Dorchester, was appointed Governor-General of all the\r\nprovinces, and Commander-in-Chief of all the forces in British America.\r\nHe arrived at Quebec on the 23rd of October, and was joyfully received\r\nby all classes, but especially by the Canadians, with whom he was a\r\ngreat favourite on account of the mildness and justice with which he had\r\ntreated them during his former administrations. At the same time there\r\nalso arrived a new Chief Justice for Quebec, Mr. Smith, who had been\r\nAttorney-General for New York, but had been forced to leave on account\r\nof his loyalty to the British Crown.\" (Tuttle's History of the Dominion\r\nof Canada, Chap. lxv., p. 321.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: \"The elections came off during June, and the people\r\nexercised their new privilege with prudence and judgment, returning good\r\nmen; and although the elections were warmly contested in some places,\r\neverything passed off quietly. There were fifteen English-speaking\r\nmembers elected, amongst whom were some of the leading merchants, such\r\nas James McGill, Joseph Frobisher, John Richardson and others, whose\r\ndescendants are still amongst our leading citizens. Amongst the French\r\nelected were many of the most prominent seignors, such as Louis De\r\nSalaberry, M.H. De Rouville, Philip Rocheblave, M.E.G.C. De Lotbiniere,\r\nM. La Vatrice and others. Altogether, it is generally claimed that the\r\nfirst Assembly of Lower Canada was the best the province ever had.\"\r\n(Tuttle's History of the Dominion of Canada, Chap. lxviii., p. 330.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: The French-speaking members nominated Mr. J.A. Parret\r\n(Panet), a leading advocate of Quebec; and the English party nominated\r\nsuccessively Mr. James McGill, one of the most prominent merchants of\r\nMontreal, and William Grant, of Quebec. The feeling was strong on each\r\nside to have in the Speaker a gentleman of their own language; but Mr.\r\nParret (Panet) was ultimately chosen by a large majority, to some extent\r\nbecause _he understood and spoke both languages fluently_. This\r\ngentleman occupied the position of Speaker for upwards of twenty years,\r\nand fully justified the wisdom of the first Assembly in electing\r\nhim.--_Ib._, p. 330.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that in some histories of Canada it should have been\r\nstated that the Speaker elected by the first House of Assembly could\r\nspeak no other tongue than the French language. Mr. Archer, in his\r\nHistory of Canada for the Use of Schools, says: \"By a vote of twenty\r\neight to eighteen, M. Panet, _who could speak no language but his native\r\nFrench_, was chosen\" (p. 269). Mr. Withrow, in his excellent History of\r\nCanada, says: \"Mr. Panet, a distinguished advocate, _who spoke no\r\nlanguage but his native French_, was elected Speaker of the Assembly\"\r\n(p. 291). The very discussion which took place on the election of\r\nSpeaker turned chiefly on the point whether a Speaker should be elected\r\nwho could speak one or both languages. Mr. P.L. Panet, brother to Mr.\r\nJ.A. Panet, who was elected Speaker, in reply to some of his own\r\ncountrymen who advocated the exclusive use of the French language, while\r\nhe advocated the ultimate use of the English language alone in the\r\nLegislature and in the courts of law, commenced and concluded his speech\r\nin the following words: \"I will explain my mind on the necessity that\r\nthe Speaker we are about to choose _should possess and speak equally\r\nwell the two languages_.\"--\"I think it is but decent that the Speaker on\r\nwhom we may fix our choice be one who can express himself in English\r\nwhen he addresses himself to the representative of our Sovereign.\"\r\n(Christie's History of Canada, Vol. I., Chap. iv., pp. 127, 128, in a\r\nnote.) Mr. Christie, after stating in the text about \"J.A. Panet, Esq.,\r\nan old and eminent advocate of the Quebec bar, returned a member for the\r\nUpper Town of Quebec, was chosen by the Assembly for its Speaker,\"\r\nremarks, in a note, before giving the speech of Mr. P.L. Panet quoted\r\nabove, that \"this excellent man and good citizen (J.A. Panet) served, as\r\nwe shall see in proceeding, many years as Speaker, and without other\r\nremuneration or reward than the approbation of his fellow-citizens and\r\nsubjects.\" (Tuttle's History of the Dominion of Canada, Chap. lxvii., p.\r\n127.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: The transmission of this letter occupied _ten weeks_, it\r\nbeing dated the 9th of February, and reaching Quebec the 25th of April.\r\nIn the _Quebec Gazette_ of the 10th of November, 1792, it is stated that\r\nthe latest news from Philadelphia and New York was to the 8th of\r\nOctober, giving accounts of a battle on the Wabash and Arguille rivers,\r\nbetween an expedition of American forces under General Wilkinson and a\r\nbody of Indians, in which the latter were routed. In a notice from the\r\n\"General Post Office, Quebec, 17th of November, 1791,\" information is\r\ngiven that \"a mail for England will be closed at this office on Monday,\r\nthe 5th of December next, at four o'clock p.m., to be forwarded by way\r\nof New York, in H.M. packet-boat which will sail from thence in\r\nJanuary.\" (Christie's History of Canada, Vol. I., Chap. iv., p. 142.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: \"Thus ended the first session of the first Parliament of\r\nLower Canada, and as a whole we may say that the session was a\r\nsatisfactory one. The demons of party spirit and of national prejudice\r\nhad indeed shown themselves; but only enough to show that they were in\r\nexistence, and would become potent agents of discord as the heat of\r\npolitical contest warmed them into life. The war of races, which had\r\nbeen going on between the French and English on this continent for over\r\na century and a half, was not ended by the capitulation and cession of\r\nCanada; only the scene of action was changed from the battle field to\r\nthe council chamber, and words and ballots took the place of swords and\r\nbullets. The French Canadians showed at the very commencement of\r\nconstitutional government that they considered the French language, the\r\nFrench people, the French laws, and the French religion, the language,\r\npeople, laws, and religion of Canada, and that the English were only\r\ninterlopers who had no business there, and with whom they were to\r\naffiliate as little as possible.\" (Tuttle's History of the Dominion of\r\nCanada, Chap. lxviii., p. 332.)\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the first sentence, we have no sympathy with the\r\nspirit or sentiment of the above quoted passage. The addresses to the\r\nGovernor and the King show that the French did not regard the British as\r\nintruders, but as the legitimate rulers of the country, to whom they\r\nexpressed all possible respect and loyalty. All that they asked on the\r\nquestion of language was, that in legislative and judicial proceedings\r\nthe French language might be equally used with the English language; and\r\nwas this unreasonable on the part of those who then comprised\r\nnine-tenths of the population, and whose laws and exercise of worship\r\nhad been guaranteed by the articles of capitulation and the Quebec Act\r\nof 1774?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: \"The Provincial Parliament met again at Quebec on the\r\n11th of November, 1793, and was opened by Lord Dorchester, who had\r\narrived at Quebec from England on the 24th of September, and re-assumed\r\nthe government; his Excellency Major-General Clarke returning to\r\nEngland, bearing with him the best wishes of those whose Constitution he\r\nhad fairly started, and put in operation to their satisfaction. His\r\ngovernment had been popular, and he received several flattering\r\naddresses at departing.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Dorchester's return was cordially welcomed, a general illumination\r\ntaking place at Quebec the evening of his arrival.\" (Christie's History\r\nof Canada, Chap. v., p. 145.)\r\n\r\n\"The great French revolution, causing France such awful scenes of\r\ndistress and bloodshed as the world had never seen before, was in\r\nprogress. It made the Canadians feel that their transfer to the Crown of\r\nEngland now saved them from innumerable evils which would have been\r\ntheir lot had Canada been again restored to France.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Dorchester's popularity and personal influence were made useful in\r\npreventing the people of the provinces from being misled by seditious\r\npersons who came from France on purpose to tamper with them.\" (Miles'\r\nSchool History of Canada, Part Third, Chap. i., p. 190.)\r\n\r\n\"All Europe was engaged in war, and the emissaries of the French\r\nrepublic were busily at work trying to gain sympathy in the United\r\nStates, and stir up that country to war with England--an effort which\r\nwould probably have succeeded had it not been for the firmness of\r\nWashington. The consul for France in the United States was also\r\nendeavouring to spread republican ideas in Canada, to incite the people\r\nto revolt against British authority, and to declare themselves in favour\r\nof the republic. It was no wonder then that the great bulk of the\r\nlaw-abiding and peace-loving citizens of Canada welcomed Lord Dorchester\r\nwith delight--one who had for so many years been associated in their\r\nrecollections with peace and prosperity, and who had successfully\r\nresisted the attack of the only foe who had assailed Quebec during his\r\nmany administrations.\" (Tuttle, Chap. lxviii., p. 333.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: It appears by a proclamation of Lord Dorchester, dated\r\nthe 26th of November, a fortnight after the commencement of the session\r\nof the Legislature, that there were emissaries of France and others in\r\nthe province, who were busy in propagating among the inhabitants the\r\nrevolutionary principles of the infidel and bloody rulers of France. He\r\nsays: \"Whereas divers evil-disposed persons had lately manifested\r\nseditious and wicked attempts to alienate the affections of his\r\nMajesty's loyal subjects by false representations of the cause and\r\nconduct of the persons at present exercising supreme authority in\r\nFrance, and particularly certain foreigners, being alien enemies, who\r\nare lurking and lie concealed in various parts of this province, _acting\r\nin concert with persons in foreign dominions_ (evidently alluding to\r\nparties in the United States), with a view to forward the criminal\r\npurposes of such persons, enemies of the peace and happiness of the\r\ninhabitants of this province, and of all religion, government, and\r\norder.\" His Excellency therefore called upon all magistrates, captains\r\nof militia, peace-officers, and others of his Majesty's good subjects\r\nthroughout the province, to be vigilant, and to do their utmost to\r\ndiscover and secure all and every person who might hold seditious\r\ndiscourses, or utter treasonable words, spread false news, publish or\r\ndistribute libellous papers, written or printed, tending to excite\r\ndiscontent or lessen the affections of his Majesty's subjects, or in any\r\nmanner to disturb the peace and happiness under his Majesty's government\r\nin this colony, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: \"The prince, shortly after this, receiving notice of his\r\npromotion to the rank of major-general, and appointment to a command in\r\nthe West Indies, was presented, previous to his departure from Quebec,\r\nwith several congratulatory letters of a most gratifying character. The\r\nLegislative Council, the Roman Catholic clergy, the citizens of Quebec,\r\nand the burgesses of William Henry paid his Royal Highness spontaneous\r\nrespects in this manner, to whom he responded feelingly and\r\naffectionately, for the spontaneous proofs of esteem which in parting\r\nthey gave him; and which in truth were not the effusions of adulation,\r\nbut an homage of a grateful people to the intrinsic virtues and the\r\nsocial and manly character of a son of, as he was truly called, 'the\r\nbest of sovereigns.'\" (Christie's History of Canada, Vol I., Chap. v.,\r\np. 140.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: The account transmitted was under six heads:\r\n\r\n1. \"The casual and territorial revenue established prior to the\r\nconquest, which his Majesty has been most graciously pleased to order to\r\nbe applied towards defraying the civil expenses of the province.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"The duties payable to his Majesty under the Act of the 14th of his\r\nreign, chap. 88 (the 'Quebec Act'), on articles imported into the\r\nprovince of Quebec, and on licenses to persons for retailing spirituous\r\nliquors.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"The duties imposed by the Provincial Legislature, with the\r\nappropriation and balance.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Amount of cash received from fines and forfeitures imposed by the\r\ncourts of justice.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"The naval officers' returns inwards since the division of the\r\nprovince, which were originally intended as a check on the customs, but\r\nseem not to answer the end imposed.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"A statement of the monies taken out of the pocket of the subject on\r\nthis account; its progress and diminution before it lodges in the public\r\ncoffers, with the after diminution on account of the collection, that\r\nevery circumstance of this important business may be constantly before\r\ntheir eyes; that in the outset of the Constitution, and its progress,\r\nthey may guard this important branch from those corruptions and abuses\r\nwhich have brought so many miseries on other nations.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Christie's History of Canada, Vol. I., Chap. v., where\r\nthe accounts referred to are given in detail.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: This return contained all the accounts transmitted the\r\nyear before, under the six heads mentioned in a previous note, page 298,\r\n(Footnote 164: above) and other accounts under fourteen additional heads,\r\nthe eighth of which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"No. 8.

By that article the province of\r\nUpper Canada is entitled to one-eighth part of the revenue already\r\npayable on goods, wares, or merchandise coming into Lower Canada, under\r\nan Act of the Legislature thereof; and to assure the most perfect\r\nfreedom of trade with the sister province, it is provided that no\r\nimposts or duties shall be imposed or shall be laid by Upper Canada,\r\nwhich renders unnecessary the establishing of Custom-houses on the line\r\nwhich divides the two provinces, but saves to both an expense which, in\r\nall probability, would far exceed any trifle of revenue that this\r\nagreement may take from one or the other of the provinces more than\r\ntheir legitimate proportion.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: The conduct and character of Lord Dorchester as governor\r\nand commander-in-chief of the army may be inferred from the following\r\namong many other notices in the Index to Bancroft's History of the\r\nUnited States, Vol. X., p. 616:\r\n\r\n\"Carleton, Guy, afterwards Lord Dorchester, colonel of Grenadiers in\r\nWolfe's army; is wounded; is at Havana (one of the commanders in taking\r\nit); Governor of Canada; has full authority to arm and employ the\r\nCanadians and Indians against the Americans; abhors the scheme; takes\r\nmeasures for the defence of the province; the command of Canada assigned\r\nto him, he will not turn the savages loose on the frontier; returns no\r\nanswer to Montgomery's summons; repels the assault made by that general;\r\nis lenient to his prisoners; his humanity to sick Americans left behind;\r\nblamed for restraining the Indians; restrains the ravages of the\r\nIndians; the King and Ministers are displeased at this; Carleton\r\nprepares to invade the United States; is displeased at being superseded\r\nby Burgoyne; refuses to assist Burgoyne; is complained of by that\r\nofficer; supersedes Clinton in America; his humanity; restrains Indian\r\nhostility.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: \"It was also one of the grievances in Lower Canada that\r\nProtestants alone were appointed Executive Councillors, and that while\r\nthe chief Protestant ecclesiastic was admitted, the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch was not allowed to be represented.

To each of these four districts a\r\njudge and a sheriff were appointed, who administered justice by means of\r\nCourts of Common Pleas.\r\n\r\nUnder the new Constitution, Upper Canada, like Lower Canada, had a\r\nLegislature consisting of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, and\r\nresponsible only to it; a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown,\r\nand the members appointed for life; and a Legislative Assembly, elected\r\nby the freeholders of the country. The Assembly was to be elected once\r\nin four years, but might be elected oftener if dissolved by the\r\nGovernor, and was empowered to raise a revenue for public services,\r\nroads, bridges, schools, etc.; the Legislative Council consisted of\r\nseven members, appointed for life by the Crown; the House of Assembly\r\nconsisted of sixteen members, elected by the people.\r\n\r\nBy usage and by approbation of the Imperial Government, though not by\r\nthe provisions of the Constitutional Act, the Lieutenant-Governor was\r\nassisted, mostly ruled, by an Executive Council, consisting for the most\r\npart of salaried officers, judges, and members of the Legislative\r\nCouncil, who were not responsible either to the Governor or to the\r\nLegislative Council, or to the House of Assembly--an independent,\r\nirresponsible body--an oligarchy which exercised great power, was very\r\nintolerant, and became very odious.\r\n\r\nThe first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada was General John Graves\r\nSimcoe, who had commanded the Queen's Rangers in the revolutionary war;\r\nhe was a landed gentleman, elected to the British House of Commons, in\r\nwhich he supported the Constitutional Act of 1791, and afterwards\r\naccepted the office of Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada created by\r\nthat Act, and did all in his power to give beneficial effect to it. He\r\narrived in Upper Canada the 8th of July, 1792, when the members of the\r\nExecutive and Legislative Councils were sworn in at Kingston, and writs\r\nwere issued for the election of members of the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\nAfter much hesitation and perplexity, the seat of government was first\r\nestablished at a village then called Newark, now Niagara, at the mouth\r\nof the Niagara River, where the Governor built a small frame house which\r\nhad to serve as a Parliament House, as well as residence for the\r\nLieutenant-Governor. The Governor, with the usual state and ceremony,\r\nopened the first session of the first Parliament of Upper Canada the\r\n17th of September, 1792. There were present three members of the\r\nLegislative Council and five members of the House of Assembly. The\r\nmembers of the Assembly have been represented as \"plain, home-spun clad\r\nfarmers and merchants, from the plough and the store.\" The members of\r\nthe Legislature have always, for the most part, been such from that day\r\nto this, but many of the members of the first Parliament of Upper Canada\r\nhad possessed respectable, and some of them luxurious homes, from which\r\nthey had been exiled by narrow-minded and bitter enemies; they had\r\nfought on battle fields for the country whose forests they now burned\r\nand felled; their home-spun garments were some of the fruits of their\r\nown industry, and that of their wives and daughters. Eight years had\r\nelapsed since 10,000 of these United Empire Loyalists, driven from their\r\nhomes in the States, came into the dense wilderness of Upper Canada, to\r\nhew out homes for themselves and their families in the vast solitude,\r\nthe silence of which was only broken by the barking of the fox, the howl\r\nof the wolf and the growl of the bear, and the occasional whoop of the\r\nIndian.[171]\r\n\r\nThe population of Upper Canada was, in 1792, about 12,000 souls. The\r\nLoyalist pioneers of Upper Canada fought as bravely against privations,\r\nhardships, and dangers in founding their forest homes, as they had done\r\nin the Royal ranks in the defence of the unity of the empire. During the\r\nfirst ten years of their hard enterprise and labours, the forest began\r\nto yield to the axe of industry, and the little cabins, and clearings,\r\nand growing crops gave evidence of human life and activity; but there\r\nwere no towns or large settlements; the inhabitants were scattered in\r\nlittle groups, or isolated log-houses, along the north shores of the\r\nRiver St. Lawrence, Lakes Ontario and Erie, and of the Detroit river,\r\nthe only gathering of houses or villages being Kingston, Newark, and\r\nAmherstburg.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the first Parliament of Upper Canada lasted only\r\nfour weeks, commencing the 17th of September, and closing the 15th of\r\nOctober, 1792; the first session of the Parliament of Lower Canada\r\nlasted nearly five months--from the 17th of December, 1792, to the 9th\r\nof May, 1793. During these nearly five months, the Legislature of Lower\r\nCanada passed eight Bills, all well prepared and useful, but with much\r\nceremony and delay from the polite French seignors; the Legislature of\r\nUpper Canada, in their session of four weeks, also passed eight Bills,\r\nindicating no haste, well prepared, and of importance and useful. The\r\nBills passed provided for the introduction of English law; the trial by\r\njury; for the charge of millers, limiting their allowance for grinding\r\nand bolting grain to the rate of one bushel for every twelve bushels\r\nground; for the easy recovery of small debts; for the change of the\r\nGerman names of the four districts into which Lord Dorchester had\r\ndivided what now constituted Upper Canada, and granted to the United\r\nEmpire Loyalists. _Lunenburg_, extending from the River Ottawa to the\r\nRiver Gananoque, was now called the _Eastern District; Mecklenburg_,\r\nextending from Gananoque to the River Trent, was called the _Middle_ or\r\n_Midland District; Nassau_, extending from the Trent to Long Point, on\r\nLake Erie, was called the _Home_ or _Niagara District_; and _Hesse_,\r\nembracing the rest of Canada, west to the Lake St. Clair, was called the\r\n_Western_ or _Detroit District_. These districts were again divided into\r\ntwelve counties. An Act was also passed to erect a jail and court-house\r\nin each district.\r\n\r\nGovernor Simcoe closed this session of the Parliament the 15th of\r\nOctober, 1792, and after complimenting both Houses on the business-like\r\nmanner in which they had performed their legislative duties, concluded\r\nhis proroguing speech with the following significant words:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot dismiss you without earnestly desiring you to promote, by\r\nprecept and example, regular habits of piety and morality, the surest\r\nfoundations of all private and public felicity; and at this juncture I\r\nparticularly recommend you to explain _that this province is signally\r\nblessed, not with a mutilated Constitution, but with a Constitution\r\nwhich has stood the test of experience, and is the very image and\r\ntranscript of that of Great Britain_, by which she has long established\r\nand secured to her subjects as much freedom and happiness as is possible\r\nto be enjoyed under the subordination necessary to civilized society.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Simcoe selected Newark as the seat of government, he\r\nthought that Fort Niagara, on the opposite side of the river, would be\r\nceded to England, as it was then occupied by a British garrison; but\r\nwhen he found that the Niagara river was to be the boundary line between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States, and that the British garrison was\r\nto be withdrawn from Fort Niagara, he judged it not wise that the\r\ncapital of Upper Canada should be within reach of the guns of an\r\nAmerican fort. He made a tour through the wilderness of the western\r\npeninsula, and proposed to found a new London for the Canadian capital,\r\non the banks of what he then called the River Thames, the site of the\r\npresent city of London, in the heart of the western district, and secure\r\nfrom invasion; but Lord Dorchester preferred Kingston, which he had made\r\nthe principal naval and military station of the province. To this\r\nGovernor Simcoe objected. It was at length agreed to select _York_, as\r\nit was then called, the site of an old French fort. Though the\r\nsurrounding land was low and swampy, the harbour was excellent.\r\n\r\nGovernor Simcoe removed to the new capital before a house was built in\r\nit, and lodged some time in a large canvas tent, pitched on the site of\r\nthe old fort, at the west end of the bay. He employed the Queen's\r\nRangers, who had accompanied him, to open a main road--Yonge\r\nStreet--from York to Lake Simcoe, called after the Governor himself. He\r\nproposed to open a direct communication between Lakes Ontario and Huron,\r\nand then with the Ottawa; and projected an enlightened and vigorous\r\npolicy for promoting the development of the country, its agriculture,\r\nfisheries, population, trade, etc.; but before he had time to mature and\r\ngive effect to his plans, he was suddenly removed, in 1796, from the\r\ngovernment of Upper Canada to that of St. Domingo, in the West Indies.\r\nHe was succeeded in the government by the senior member of the Executive\r\nCouncil, the Hon. Peter Russel, who improved his two years'\r\nadministration, not by carrying out the patriotic plans of his\r\npredecessor, but by granting lands to himself and his friends for\r\nspeculation, to the impediment of settlements and often to the\r\ndisappointment and wrong of real settlers, whose applications for lands\r\nwere rejected, which were afterwards granted to the land-speculating\r\nfriends of the Governor, or to himself--whose grants to himself are said\r\nto have run something on this wise: \"I, Peter Russel, Lieutenant-Governor,\r\netc., do grant to you, Peter Russel, etc.\"[172]\r\n\r\nGeneral Simcoe zealously encouraged emigration to and settlement in the\r\ncountry, and during the four years of his administration the population\r\nincreased to 30,000. There was a very considerable emigration from the\r\nUnited States of persons who did not like the new system of government\r\nthere, and to whom the first Loyalist settlers had written, or visited,\r\ngiving a favourable account of the climate and productiveness of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThough the seat of government was removed to Toronto in 1795, the\r\nParliament continued to meet at Niagara until 1797. During its\r\nsuccessive sessions at Niagara (then Newark), the Parliament passed Acts\r\nfor the civil and municipal administration of the country, the\r\nconstruction of roads, fixing duties on goods imported from England and\r\nthe United States, etc., etc. The Legislature gave a reward of twenty\r\nand ten shillings respectively for the heads or scalps of wolves and\r\nbears, an Act suggestive of the exposures of the early settlers; and\r\nallowed the members of the Assembly ten shillings per day each. In the\r\nsecond session, the first Parliament passed an Act forbidding the\r\nintroduction of slavery into the province--ten years in advance of Lower\r\nCanada on this subject.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Hunter succeeded the Hon. Peter Russel, in 1799, as\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. He possessed little energy or\r\nenterprise, and did little or nothing except as advised by his Executive\r\nCouncil of five; so that the Government of Upper Canada was practically\r\nan oligarchy, irresponsible alike to Governor and people, each member\r\nreceiving £100 per annum as Councillor, besides the lands he was able to\r\nobtain. Yet the Government, upon the whole, was satisfactory to the\r\ncountry, and commanded for many years the support of its elected\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nWhen General Hunter first met the Parliament in Toronto, the 2nd of\r\nJune, 1800, the growth of Upper Canada having been rapid, its population\r\nnow numbered upwards of 50,000. This year, 1800, the Legislature passed\r\nan Act prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors to the Indians. In\r\n1802, the Legislature of Upper Canada, as had that of Lower Canada,\r\npassed an Act appropriating £750 to encourage the growth of hemp, in\r\norder to render England independent of Russia in the supply of hemp for\r\ncordage for the navy, as was being rapidly the case in the supply of\r\ntimber to build ships. As obstructions on the St. Lawrence rendered\r\ncommunication more difficult between Upper and Lower Canada than with\r\nAlbany and New York, articles of commerce from Europe could be more\r\nreadily brought in by that route than by the St. Lawrence; a\r\nconsiderable trade sprang up with the United States, which rendered\r\nnecessary the establishment of custom-houses on the frontiers.\r\nAccordingly, ports of entry were established at Cornwall, Brockville,\r\nKingston, Toronto, Niagara, Queenston, Fort Erie, Turkey Point,\r\nAmherstburg, and Sandwich, the duties being the same on American as on\r\nEnglish goods. The Governor was authorized to appoint collectors, at\r\nsalaries not exceeding £100 currency per annum, except when the amount\r\nof duties collected at a port was less than £100, in which case the\r\ncollector was allowed one-half of the amount collected in lieu of\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 Parliament made provision for eight masters of grammar schools,\r\none for each district, and at a salary of £100 currency ($400) for each\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime emigration continued large. Many of the emigrants were\r\nfrom the United States. The troubles of '98 in Ireland were followed by\r\na large Irish emigration to Canada; there were also a considerable\r\nnumber of Scotch and a few English emigrants; but the larger number of\r\nemigrants were from Ireland and the United States.[174]\r\n\r\nThe Legislature continued from session to session to pass Bills for the\r\nvarious improvements of the country; after doing which its members did\r\nnot give much attention to politics, but devoted themselves to the\r\nculture and enlargement of their farms, of which their descendants are\r\nat this day reaping large advantages.[175]\r\n\r\nMr. McMullen, in his History of Canada, speaking of the year 1809, says:\r\n\r\n\"No civilized country in the world was less burdened with taxes than\r\nCanada West at this period. A small direct tax on property, levied by\r\nthe District Courts of Session, and not amounting to £3,500 for the\r\nwhole country, sufficed for all local expenses. There was no poor rate,\r\nno capitation tax, no tithes, or ecclesiastical rates of any kind.\r\nInstead of a road tax, a few days' statute labour annually sufficed.\r\nNowhere did the working man find the produce of his labour so little\r\ndiminished by exactions of any kind. Canada West literally teemed with\r\nabundance; while its people, unlike the early French and Americans, had\r\nnothing to fear from the red man, and enjoyed the increase of the earth\r\nin peace.\"\r\n\r\nI have thus given a brief narrative of the formation of the government\r\nof Upper Canada, and of the first seventeen years of its operations,\r\ndown to the period when the anticipated hostilities between Great\r\nBritain and the United States--the latter being the tools of Napoleon to\r\nrescue Canada from Great Britain--rendered preparation necessary on the\r\npart of the Loyalists of Canada to defend their country and homes\r\nagainst foreign invasion.\r\n\r\nI have also given some account of the first settlement of the country,\r\nand the privations and hardships of the first settlers. But believing\r\nthat a narrative from a single pen could not do justice to this subject,\r\nor could present to the reader, in so vivid and interesting a light, the\r\ncharacter, sufferings, courage, and enterprise of our country's\r\nforefathers and founders, as narratives from themselves, with the\r\ndiversity of style characteristic of communications from various\r\nsources, I have therefore inserted in Chapter XLI. those interesting\r\npapers transmitted to me from time to time, at my request, during the\r\nlast twenty years.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: But the Indians were friendly to white settlers, as they\r\nhave always been. Almost the entire Mohawk tribe, with other loyalist\r\nIndians, under their chief, Joseph Brant, followed the fortunes of their\r\nwhite loyalist brethren, and settled on their reservation on the Grand\r\nRiver. Brant had been educated in a Christian school in Philadelphia;\r\nhad a comfortable home, and lived respectably on the Mohawk river before\r\nthe American revolution; had entertained missionaries, and had assisted\r\none of them in translating a part of the New Testament and Prayer Book\r\ninto the Mohawk language. Colonel Stone, in his \"Life of Brant\" and the\r\n\"History of the Border Wars of the American Revolution,\" has nobly\r\nvindicated the character of Brant, and of his brethren of the Six\r\nNations, from the misrepresentations and calumnies of American\r\nhistorians. Brant was a member of the Church of England, and built a\r\nchurch in his settlement in 1786, in which was placed the first church\r\nbell ever heard in Upper Canada.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: \"During Colonel Simcoe's administration he had been\r\nexceedingly careful with regard to the distribution of lands; but\r\nimmediately on his departure, irregularities began to creep into the\r\nCrown Land Department, just as it had in Lower Canada, and great\r\ninjustice was done to the actual settlers. Large tracts of the most\r\neligible sites were seized upon by Government officials and speculators,\r\nand the actual settlers found themselves in many instances thrust into\r\nout-of-the-way corners, and cut off from intercourse with any near\r\nneighbours for want of roads.\" (Tuttle's History of the Dominion of\r\nCanada, Chap. lxxxiii., p. 387.)\r\n\r\n\"On the removal of Governor Simcoe,[173] of his wise schemes fell\r\nthrough. Land designed for settlements was seized by speculators,\r\nespecially in the vicinity of Toronto, and the general development of\r\nthe country was greatly retarded.\" (Withrow's History of Canada, Chap,\r\nxvi., p. 293.)\r\n\r\nScarcely any--if any--of these early land speculators had served as\r\n_United Empire Loyalists_ during the revolutionary war; and their\r\ndescendants, if existing, are as little known as if their fathers had\r\nnever lived.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Lord Dorchester did not endorse Governor Simcoe's policy,\r\nas the latter had not concurred with the former in giving German names\r\nto the four first districts of Upper Canada, and in the selection of the\r\nseat of government. The American Government represented Governor Simcoe\r\nas exciting the Iroquois or Mohawks, both in Canada and Western New\r\nYork, against it--representations in which there was not a shadow of\r\ntruth, though Americans were endeavouring to excite disaffection to the\r\nBritish Government and sympathy with republican France against England\r\nin both Upper and Lower Canada, especially in the latter province. But\r\nby these representations, and those of disappointed local speculators,\r\nthe Home Government removed Governor Simcoe, the father of\r\nconstitutional, pure, and progressive government in Upper Canada.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: \"In Upper as well as Lower Canada the first sixteen\r\nyears' experience of the new Constitution had been very encouraging. All\r\nconcerned in working it out during that period kept as clear as possible\r\nfrom causes of discord. The consequence was that harmony and good\r\nprogress marked the early career of the province.\" (Miles' School\r\nHistory of Canada, Part III., Chap. i., pp. 193, 194.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: \"Meanwhile the country had steadily prospered,\r\nundisturbed in its forest isolation by the great European war, which was\r\ndeluging with blood a hundred battle fields and desolating thousands of\r\nhomes. By the year 1809, the population had increased to about 70,000.\r\nTaxes were exceedingly light. The Customs revenue, derived principally\r\nfrom the imports of groceries--for clothing was chiefly\r\nhome-spun--amounted to £7,000.\" (Withrow's History of Canada, Chap.\r\nxxi., p. 296.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nWAR BY THE UNITED STATES AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN, FROM 1812 TO\r\n1815--INTRODUCTORY AND GENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war between Great Britain and the United States, from 1812 to 1815,\r\nfurnishes the strongest example of the present century, or of any age or\r\ncountry, of the attachment of a people to their mother country, and of\r\ntheir determination, at whatever sacrifice and against whatever\r\ndisparity, to maintain the national life of their connection with it.\r\nThe true spirit of _the Loyalists of America_ was never exhibited with\r\ngreater force and brilliancy than during the war of 1812-1815.\r\n\r\nEngland was engaged in a death struggle for the independence of the\r\ncontinental nations of Europe and the rights of mankind. At the darkest\r\nhour of that eventful contest, when the continent was drenched with the\r\nblood of nations, and the Tyrant had his feet upon their neck, and\r\nEngland alone stood erect, taxing her resources to the utmost and\r\nshedding her best blood for human freedom, the Democratic party in the\r\nUnited States--the ever anti-British party--the pro-slavery party--the\r\nparty in the United States least subordinate to law and most inimical to\r\nliberty--at such a crisis such a party declared war against Britain, and\r\nforthwith invaded Canada, before the declaration of war was known in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAt that time the population of Lower Canada was 225,000 souls--200,000\r\nof whom were French; the population of Upper Canada was 75,000; the\r\npopulation of the United States was upwards of 8,000,000: so that the\r\npopulation of the _two Canadas_ was to that of the United States as one\r\nto twenty-seven; and the population of _Upper Canada_ was to that of the\r\nUnited States as one to one hundred and six.\r\n\r\nYet the Canadas, with a frontier of more than 1,000 miles, and aided by\r\na few regiments of regular soldiers, sent as a mere guard for the\r\nprincipal cities, from Halifax to Amherstburg, resisted the whole\r\nmilitary power of the United States for two years, at the end of which\r\nnot an inch of Canadian ground was in possession of the invaders; and\r\nwithin six months after England had given freedom and peace to\r\nEurope--chaining its Tyrant to the island rock of Elba, sweeping with\r\nits fleet the coasts of the United States, and sending 16,000 veteran\r\nsoldiers to aid the struggling Canadas--the boasting Madison and his\r\nGovernment sued for peace, without even mentioning the original pretexts\r\nof war, which Great Britain generously granted.\r\n\r\nIt does not come within our purpose to write a history of this war; we\r\npresent only such phases and events of it as will illustrate the\r\nLoyalist spirit and courage of the Canadians, French as well as English,\r\nand even true Americans; for the American settlers in Canada were, with\r\nfew exceptions, as loyal subjects and as bold defenders of their adopted\r\ncountry as the U.E. Loyalists themselves; and even the most virtuous and\r\nintelligent part of the citizens of the United States protested against\r\nthe alliance of the Democratic rulers at Washington with the tyrant and\r\nscourge of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe shall notice, in the first place, the alleged and real causes of the\r\nwar; secondly, the preparations for it made by the Governments and\r\nLegislatures of the two Canadas; thirdly, the invasions of each\r\nprovince, each year, separately, and the battles fought. There were no\r\nless than eleven invasions of the Canadas by the American armies during\r\nthe three years of the war, besides naval engagements, and various\r\nincursions of marauding and plundering parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nALLEGED AND REAL CAUSES OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the first--from the treaty of peace between Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States in 1783--there was a large party in the United States\r\nbitterly and actively hostile to England and its colonies; that party\r\nhad persecuted and driven the Loyalists from the United States, and\r\ncompelled them to seek homes in the Canadian wilderness, and had even\r\nfollowed them with its enmities in their new abodes; that party had\r\nsympathized with the revolutionists of France, who crimsoned the streets\r\nof Paris with the blood of their Sovereign and fellow-citizens, and who\r\nsent emissaries to Canada to subvert legal authority, and excite the\r\nstrife of anarchy and bloodshed. The base of the operations of all the\r\nemissaries of French revolutionists in Canada was for twenty years the\r\nUnited States, aided directly and indirectly by American sympathizers;\r\nthat same party sympathized and even leagued with Napoleon against\r\nEngland while she was defending the liberties of Europe and of mankind;\r\nit was the same party that in subsequent years aided the rebel Mackenzie\r\nand the rabble Fenians to invade Canada, allowing the United States to\r\nbe the base of their organizations, and opening to them the American\r\narsenals of arms and ammunition; it was the same party that, in\r\nconspiracy with the Tyrant of France and the enemy of human freedom,\r\ndeclared war against Great Britain in 1812, in order to wrest Canada\r\nfrom her possession, and make it an appendage of France and the United\r\nStates.[176]\r\n\r\nThe American Government alleged two reasons as the ground of its\r\ndeclaration of war against Britain: the one was, that the British\r\nGovernment had issued Orders in Council which injured the American\r\ncommerce with other countries; the other was, that the British\r\nGovernment had infringed the rights of the United States by authorizing\r\nthe boarding of American vessels in search of deserters from the English\r\narmy and navy, and seizing them.\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these reasons, namely, the English Orders in Council,\r\nthe facts are as follow: \"After the annihilation of the naval power of\r\nFrance at _Trafalgar_ in 1805, by Lord Nelson, the principal\r\ntransactions of France at sea were the fitting out and arming of\r\nprivateers to prey upon the English merchant vessels and commerce. To\r\naccomplish his purpose more effectually, Napoleon promulgated the\r\nfollowing year after the destruction of his fleet what is called the\r\nBerlin Decree.\"[177]\r\n\r\n\"No nation was allowed to trade with any other country in any articles\r\nthe growth, produce, or manufactures of any of the British dominions,\r\nall of which, as well as the island of Great Britain itself, were\r\ndeclared to be in a state of blockade. He appointed residents in every\r\ntrading country, and no ship was to be admitted into any of his ports\r\nwithout a _certification of origin_; that is, of the nature of the goods\r\nthey carried, and that no part of these was English. In consequence of\r\nthese Decrees, the English commerce, during the months of August,\r\nSeptember, and October, 1807--that part of the year in which the Berlin\r\nDecree of November, 1806, was carried into full effect--was not only\r\ngreatly cramped, but lay prostrated on the ground, and motionless,\r\nbefore a protecting and self-defensive system was adopted by our Orders\r\nin Council.\"[178]\r\n\r\nThe British Orders in Council were dated January 7th, 1807, and were a\r\nmeasure of retaliation for the protection of British commerce in\r\nresponse to Napoleon's Berlin Decree of the 21st of November, 1806. By\r\nthese Orders in Council, \"all trade to France or her dependencies was\r\nstrictly prohibited; all vessels, of whatever nation, which ventured to\r\nengage in this trade were declared liable to seizure, and France and her\r\ndependencies were thus reduced to that state of blockade with which she\r\nhad vainly threatened the British islands. The Orders in Council\r\nadmitted but of one exception to this general blockade of the French\r\nempire. The French had declared all vessels liable to seizure which had\r\ntouched at a British port; the Orders in Council, to counteract this\r\nprovision, declared, on the other hand, that only such ships as were in\r\nthat situation should be permitted to sail for France. Thus did the\r\nutter extinction of the foreign trade of France result as a natural\r\nconsequence of the very measures of her own Government; measures which\r\nno despotism, how ignorant soever, would have ventured to adopt, had it\r\nnot trusted to a power which effectually silenced all popular\r\nopinion.\"[179]\r\n\r\nAs France was the aggressor upon the rights of neutrals by the Berlin\r\nDecree, and as the Orders in Council were a defensive retaliation upon\r\nFrance for her attempt to destroy English commerce, the American\r\nGovernment should have first remonstrated with France and demanded\r\nreparation; but this was not the case; the outcry of the Madison\r\npartizans was against England alone. It is true some grumbling words\r\nwere uttered by some parties against the policy and acts of the French\r\nGovernment; but mere words to save appearances, not followed up by any\r\nacts; for by a collusion between Napoleon and Madison, it was understood\r\nthat the Articles of the Berlin Decree were not intended to apply to\r\nships of the United States--would not be executed against them--and were\r\nintended to destroy the commerce of Great Britain. An American writer\r\n(Lossing) remarks, \"_With a partiality towards the Americans that was\r\npractical friendship_, the French cruisers did not, for a whole year,\r\ninterfere with American vessels trading with Great Britain;\" and Mr.\r\nAlex. Baring, M.P. (afterwards Lord Ashburton), in his _Inquiry into the\r\nCauses and Consequences of the Orders in Council_, said that _\"no\r\ncondemnation of an American vessel had ever taken place under it\"_.\r\n\r\nBy this collusion between the Tyrant of Europe and the President of the\r\nUnited States, the necessities of France were supplied, and the shipping\r\ninterests of the United States largely promoted, at the expense of the\r\ncommerce and shipping interests of England.\r\n\r\nBut the collusion, or conspiracy, between Napoleon and Madison were\r\ncarried on to weaken the English navy by the desertion of its sailors,\r\nas well as to injure English commerce by connivance in behalf of\r\nAmerican trading vessels. The seduction of deserters from the British\r\nnavy, and even army, was carried on successfully on a large scale. The\r\nsafety of England consisted chiefly in her navy, which she was\r\nincreasing and strengthening by every possible means. Therefore every\r\nskilled sailor was of importance to England, while every practicable\r\nscheme was resorted to by her enemies to induce and facilitate the\r\ndesertion of her seamen and soldiers--especially of her seamen, several\r\nthousands of whom were detected and seized on board of American\r\nvessels--constituting as they did the best sailors on board American\r\nmerchant vessels, and the vital strength of the French privateers. To\r\nstop this depleting of her naval resources, England put in exercise her\r\nright of boarding vessels of neutral powers in search of deserters from\r\nher navy. The only neutral power in Europe was Sardinia; so that the\r\nUnited States was the only neutral power that had vessels upon the\r\nocean; and the President of the United States was conniving against\r\nEngland with the usurper and oppressor of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe right of a belligerent power to search the vessels of neutral powers\r\nin search of deserters had never been denied, though the modification of\r\nits exercise had frequently been sought; but under the teachings of\r\nNapoleon, his American pupils now began to exclaim against it as an\r\ninfringement of national dignity and rights. The English Government had\r\ndirected the exercise of this right with the greatest caution and\r\ncourtesy, and only in regard to vessels on board of which, from specific\r\ninformation, there was reason to believe there were English deserters.\r\nThese deserters, on getting smuggled on board of American vessels, would\r\nforthwith take the oath of allegiance to the United States, and be\r\nrecognized and claimed as American citizens.[180]\r\n\r\nAn event now occurred which enabled President Madison to excite his\r\npartizans throughout the United States to a flame of indignation\r\nagainst England. Information had been received that there were English\r\ndeserters on board the American ship _Chesapeake_; the British warship\r\n_Leopard_ sought their restoration, and on being refused fired into the\r\n_Chesapeake_, and recovered the four deserters claimed. The attendant\r\ncircumstances being omitted, the simple fact announced by the President\r\nto Congress, that the English warship _Leopard_ had fired into the\r\nAmerican ship _Chesapeake_, and in American waters, killing several\r\npersons, and had seized and carried off four American citizens, produced\r\nthe excitement he was anxious to create against England, preparatory to\r\nthe war on which he was then determined--in the zenith of Napoleon's\r\nsuccess and power, and in the extremity of England's struggle for her\r\nown existence and the liberties of mankind. The statement of the\r\nAmerican President as to the affair of the ships _Leopard_ and\r\n_Chesapeake_ has been repeated to this day by American historians, and\r\nis used in American school books to illustrate England's arrogance and\r\ncruelty; whereas all the facts of the case prove directly the reverse.\r\nWe give the account of the affair from one American writer, who, though\r\npartial, was too honest to omit essential facts, much less to pervert\r\nthem; we refer to Dr. Holmes, author of _American Annals_, and quote at\r\nlength his account of the affair. He says:\r\n\r\n\"The frigate _Chesapeake_, being ordered to cruise in the Mediterranean\r\nSea, under the command of Commodore Barron, sailing from Hampton Roads,\r\nwas come up with by the British ship-of-war _Leopard_, one of a\r\nsquadron then at anchor within the limits of the United States. An\r\nofficer was sent from the _Leopard_ to the _Chesapeake_ with a note from\r\nthe captain respecting some deserters from his Britannic Majesty's\r\nships, supposed to be serving as part of the crew of the _Chesapeake_\r\nand enclosing a copy of an order from Vice-Admiral Berkeley requiring\r\nand directing the commanders of ships and vessels under his command, in\r\ncase of meeting with the American frigate at sea, and without the limits\r\nof the United States, to show the order to her captain, and to require\r\nto search his ship for the deserters from certain ships therein named,\r\nand to proceed and search for them; and if a similar demand should be\r\nmade by the American, he was permitted to search for deserters from\r\ntheir service, according to the custom and usage of civilized nations on\r\nterms of amity with each other. Commodore Barron gave an answer that he\r\nknew of no such men as were described; that the recruiting officers for\r\nthe _Chesapeake_ had been particularly instructed by the Government,\r\nthrough him, not to enter any deserters from his Britannic Majesty's\r\nships; that he knew of none such being in her; that he was instructed\r\nnever to permit the crew of any ship under his command to be mustered by\r\nany officers but her own; that he was disposed to preserve harmony, and\r\nhoped his answer would prove satisfactory. The _Leopard_, shortly after\r\nthis answer was received by her commander, ranged alongside of the\r\n_Chesapeake_, and commenced a heavy fire upon her. The _Chesapeake_,\r\nunprepared for action, made no resistance, but remained under the fire\r\nof the _Leopard_ from twenty to thirty minutes; when, having suffered\r\nmuch damage, and lost three men killed and eighteen wounded, Commodore\r\nBarron ordered his colours to be struck, and sent a lieutenant on board\r\nthe _Leopard_ to inform her commander that he considered the\r\n_Chesapeake_ her prize. The commander of the _Leopard_ sent an officer\r\non board, who took possession of the _Chesapeake_, mustered her crew,\r\nand, carrying off four of her men, abandoned the ship. Commodore Barron,\r\nafter a communication, by writing, with the commander of the _Leopard_,\r\nfinding that the _Chesapeake_ was very much injured, returned, with the\r\nadvice of his officers, to Hampton Roads.\" (American State Papers,\r\n1806-08.)\r\n\r\n\"On receiving information of this outrage, the President, by\r\nproclamation, interdicted the harbours and waters of the United States\r\nto all armed British vessels, forbade all intercourse with them, and\r\nordered a sufficient force for the protection of Norfolk, and such other\r\npreparations as the occasion appeared to require. An armed vessel of the\r\nUnited States was dispatched with instructions to the American Minister\r\nat London to call on the British Government for the satisfaction and\r\nsecurity which the outrage required.\" (American State Papers, 1806-08,\r\npp. 183, 184, 248-252.)[181]\r\n\r\nSuch is the American State Paper account of this affair, published some\r\nyears afterwards; and from this it will be seen that what was asked by\r\nthe captain of the _Leopard_ was what had been granted by all neutral\r\nnations to belligerents--to seek for and take their own deserters on\r\nboard of neutral vessels, in order to prevent neutrals from being, or\r\nsuspected of being, in collusion with either belligerent party. The\r\nAmerican Government being in sympathy with the French Government during\r\nthe whole of its twenty years' war with England, sought to change and\r\nevade this hitherto undisputed usage of mutually friendly nations in\r\nregard to belligerents. The _Chesapeake_ seems to have been selected to\r\nmake up a cause of war with Great Britain, by the warlike proceedings of\r\nthe President before communicating with the British Government on the\r\nsubject. The American people had nothing but a complete perversion of\r\nthe facts of the case until years afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt is plain from the true version of the affair that the captain of the\r\n_Leopard_ acted courteously and fairly, though in excess of the\r\nauthority granted by the British Government; that he offered the same\r\nfacilities to the captain of the _Chesapeake_, in regard to examination\r\nfor deserters, that he asked himself; that the commander of the\r\n_Chesapeake_ stated what he knew to be untrue when he asserted that\r\nthere were no deserters on board the _Chesapeake_, which he knew would\r\nbe detected on examination of his crew.\r\n\r\nIn all the American accounts and discussions on the question, they\r\nignore the usage or customary law of civilized nations as to neutral or\r\nmutually friendly nations in respect to belligerent powers, and are\r\nsilent as to France and England being at war with each other, and that\r\nin encouraging desertions from the English ships, and then claiming them\r\nas American citizens, they were playing into the hands of Bonaparte\r\nagainst England.\r\n\r\nIt appears that President Madison, without awaiting or asking\r\nsatisfaction or explanation on this affair of the _Leopard_ and\r\n_Chesapeake_, forthwith prohibited the anchoring of British war ships in\r\nAmerican waters, and then sent a special messenger and communication to\r\nthe American Minister in London to demand satisfaction of the British\r\nGovernment for the alleged \"outrage\" upon the _Chesapeake_. But did the\r\nBritish Government show the passion and violence of the President of the\r\nUnited States? Let the American author above quoted be our witness again\r\non this point. Dr. Holmes says:\r\n\r\n\"Reparation was made by the British for the attack on the _Chesapeake_.\r\nAugustus J. Foster, the British envoy, informed the Secretary of the\r\nUnited States that he was instructed to repeat to the American\r\nGovernment the prompt disavowal made by his Majesty, on being apprised\r\nof the unauthorized act of the officer in command of his naval forces on\r\nthe coast of America, whose recall from a highly important and\r\nhonourable command immediately ensued, as a mark of his Majesty's\r\ndisapprobation; that he was authorized to offer, in addition to that\r\ndisavowal on the part of his Majesty, to order the immediate\r\nrestoration, as far as circumstances would admit, of the men who [though\r\ndeserters], in consequence of Admiral Berkeley's orders, were forcibly\r\ntaken out of the _Chesapeake_, to the vessel from which they were taken;\r\nor, if that ship were no longer in commission, to such seaport of the\r\nUnited States as the American Government may name for the purpose; and\r\nthat he was authorized to offer to the American Government a suitable\r\npecuniary provision for the sufferers in consequence of the attack on\r\nthe _Chesapeake_, including the families of those seamen who fell in the\r\naction, and of the wounded survivors. The President acceded to these\r\npropositions; and the officer commanding the _Chesapeake_, then lying in\r\nthe harbour of Boston, was instructed to receive the men, who were to be\r\nrestored to that ship.\"--_Ib._, p. 443.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that such a spontaneous, courteous, and just\r\nproceeding on the part of England would have satisfied even the\r\nbellicose President Madison; but he was bent on joining the Tyrant of\r\nEurope in war against England; the American public were kept in\r\nignorance of the instigating circumstances, and the just and generous\r\nconduct of the British Government in regard to the affair of the\r\n_Leopard_ and the _Chesapeake_, and availed himself of every occurrence\r\nor incident to excite and increase the war feeling in the United States\r\nagainst England.\r\n\r\nAn incident soon occurred answerable to President Madison's purpose. A\r\nrenegade by the name of _Henry_, who had in youth emigrated from\r\nIreland, and who had, by the interest of friends, got appointed captain\r\nof militia; but not succeeding in the United States to the extent of his\r\nambition, emigrated to Montreal, where, by some talents and address, and\r\nprofessed love of British institutions, he ingratiated himself in the\r\ngood graces of the principal persons at Montreal, and commenced his\r\nstudies at law there, with a view of qualifying himself for a seat on\r\nthe judicial bench of _Upper Canada_, to which he was vain and ambitious\r\nenough to aspire. He at length got access to the Governor-General, Sir\r\nJames Craig, into whose confidence he so wormed himself as to obtain a\r\nletter of recognition and recommendation to visit Massachusetts and\r\nother eastern States to ascertain and report upon the state of feeling\r\nthere in regard to the sympathy of those States with England in case of\r\nwar with England; but neither the British Government nor even Sir James\r\nCraig's Canadian Executive Council had the slightest knowledge of this\r\nconfidential epistolary intrigue between his Excellency and the renegade\r\nAmerican militia captain, who professed to be familiar with the politics\r\nand parties of the New England States, where there was vehement\r\nopposition to the democratic and war government of President Madison,\r\nand supposed to cherish a strong leaning to England. While this\r\nunprincipled \"Captain Henry\" was sauntering in the public-houses and\r\nbrothels of Boston, he wrote from time to time letters to Sir James\r\nCraig and other principal persons in Quebec; but the Governor and others\r\nwho received his ostentatious and pretentious letters--though amused by\r\nthem--derived no more information from his epistles than from the public\r\nnewspapers of the day. Henry, however, estimated his own worthless\r\nservices of the greatest importance; and failing to get from Sir James\r\nCraig the amount of his demands, he appealed for compensation to the\r\nGovernment in England. He addressed a memorial to the Earl of Liverpool,\r\nPrincipal Secretary of State for the Colonies, stating his services, and\r\nsuggesting that the appointment of Judge Advocate General of Lower\r\nCanada, with the salary of £500 per annum, or a consulate in the United\r\nStates, _sine cura_, would be considered by him as a fair discharge of\r\nthe obligation of the Government to him for his services. Lord Liverpool\r\nwas not disposed to prostitute such favours upon a mercenary and\r\nintriguing vagrant, and referred him to the Government of Lower Canada,\r\nthen in charge of Sir George Prevost, who had succeeded Sir James Craig.\r\nHenry knew the little estimate that was placed upon his services in\r\nCanada; he therefore betook himself back to the United States, and\r\noffered his traitorous letters to the American Government for $50,000,\r\nwhich he obtained, paid out of the United States Secret Service\r\nFund.[182] President Madison, instead of laying the correspondence\r\nbefore the British Government for explanation and satisfaction,\r\ncommunicated it to Congress, as a discovery and illustration of a\r\nconspiracy by the British Government to subvert the Constitution and\r\nGovernment of the United States, and by his message inflamed the\r\nCongress to the highest pitch of excitement, in the climax of which he\r\ngot a vote in favour of a declaration of war against Great Britain. The\r\nPresident, in his message to Congress, referring to the Henry documents\r\nsaid: \"They prove that at a recent period, while the United States,\r\nnotwithstanding the wrongs sustained by them, ceased not to observe the\r\nlaws of neutrality towards Great Britain, and in the midst of amicable\r\nprofessions and negotiations on the part of the British Government\r\nthrough its public Minister here [Mr. Erskine], a _secret agent of that\r\nGovernment_ was employed in certain States--more especially at the seat\r\nof government in Massachusetts--in fomenting disaffection to the\r\nconstituted authorities of the nation, and in intrigues with the\r\ndisaffected, for the purpose of bringing about resistance to the laws,\r\nand eventually, in concert with a British force, of destroying the\r\nUnion, and forming the eastern part thereof into a political connection\r\nwith England.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days before the transmission of President Madison's message of\r\naccusation against England, the British Minister at Washington declared\r\nin the public prints his entire ignorance of any transaction of the\r\nkind, and asked the United States Government to consider the character\r\nof the individual who had made these disclosures,[183] and to \"suspend\r\nany further judgment on its merits until the circumstances shall have\r\nbeen made known to his Majesty's Government.\" But such fairness to\r\nEngland did not answer President Madison's purpose to get himself\r\nre-elected President, by exciting hostility and declaring war against\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: \"The war party in the United States was not very strong,\r\nnumerically speaking, and it was not composed of the most respectable\r\nportions of the community; but what it lacked in these two requisites it\r\nmade up in loud and demonstrative clamour, and the more serious-minded\r\nand important portions of the people were being forced, against their\r\nbetter judgment, into a position hostile to Great Britain, by the\r\ncontinued cry of a few demagogues, who were more anxious to give vent to\r\ntheir old feeling of spite against Great Britain than to consult the\r\nbest interests of their country.\" (Tuttle's History of the Dominion of\r\nCanada, Chap. lxxii., p. 349.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: This Decree is dated \"Imperial Camp, Berlin, November\r\n21st, 1806.\" Its principal Articles are as follow:\r\n\r\n\"Art. 1.

The\r\nburst of indignation which followed was even more violent than that\r\nwhich was produced by the Orders in Council in 1793 [1807]. Party\r\nanimosity was suspended; meetings were assembled in every village; the\r\nnewspapers were filled with formal addresses; volunteer companies were\r\neverywhere set on foot; and, in the first frenzy of the moment, the\r\nuniversal cry was for immediate war. Although hostilities were not\r\ndeclared, the feelings of America were from that day at war with\r\nEngland.\" (Breckenridge's History of the War of 1812.)\r\n\r\nThis state of feeling was precisely what President Madison wished to\r\ncreate, preparatory to his meditated war with England, in connection\r\nwith the French usurper.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: \"Indignant at this neglectful treatment, Henry returned\r\nto Boston, and obtained a letter of introduction from Governor Gerry to\r\nMadison, to whom he offered to divulge the whole conspiracy, _of which\r\nhe had been the head and soul_, for a certain sum of money. Madison gave\r\nhim $50,000, and the swindler embarked for France. There is but little\r\ndoubt that Henry made a fool of the Governor of Canada, and completely\r\noverreached the President. The publication of the correspondence,\r\nhowever, increased the hatred both against the Federalists and the\r\nEnglish nation.\" [The object President Madison had in view.] (Headley's\r\nHistory of the War of 1812-1815 with England, p. 49.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: \"The _Henry Plot_ (as it was denominated) was clamoured\r\nthrough America as a crime of the deepest dye on the part of Great\r\nBritain, tending to disorganize the Government, to dismember the Union,\r\nand to destroy the independence of the States. The fictitious and\r\nexaggerated importance which the American Government affected to attach\r\nto this trivial matter had, however, some influence in confirming the\r\nspirit of hostility towards Great Britain which at that time pervaded\r\nAmerica, and shortly after broke out in open war. This self-sufficient\r\nmiscreant having, as he fancied, taken ample vengeance upon the\r\nGovernment of his native country, could not, with any degree of decency,\r\nremain in the States, from whence he sailed for France in an American\r\nsloop-of-war, carrying with him the reward of his treason and the\r\nuniversal contempt of mankind.\" (Christie's History of the War of 1812,\r\np. 55.)\r\n\r\nYet, at this very time, there were American and French emissaries in\r\nboth the Canadas (as the proclamations of the Governors show), with a\r\nview of exciting disaffection to the British Canadian Government, in\r\norder to wrest the Canadas from England and subject them to France and\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\"The Americans had been declaring, for several years, that they would\r\ntake the provinces. They had even boasted of the ease with which the\r\nintended conquest could be made by them whenever they pleased. They\r\nbelieved, or pretended to believe, that the majority of the people,\r\nowing to dissensions and a desire to be free from the mother country,\r\nwould not take part against them in this contest with Great Britain.\"\r\n(Dr. Miles' History of Canada, Part III., Chap. iii., p. 201.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF WAR BY THE UNITED STATES AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN, AND\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE INVASION OF CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bill for declaring war against Britain passed the Congress June\r\n18th, 1812, after protracted discussions: by the House of Congress, by a\r\nmajority of forty--seventy-nine to thirty-nine--by the Senate, by a\r\nmajority of six.[184] The vote for the declaration of war was a purely\r\nparty vote; the war itself was a purely partizan war--the carrying out\r\nof intrigue between the American Democratic President and the French\r\ndespoiler of Europe--a war against the intelligence and patriotism of\r\nthe American people, as well as against the independence and liberties\r\nof nations; a war in which the very selection of generals and officers\r\nwere, as a general rule, partizan appointments.[185]\r\n\r\nThe war party consisted largely of the mob or refuse of the nation--of\r\nthose who had nothing to lose and everything to gain by such a\r\nwar--facts which will go far to account, with three or four exceptions,\r\nfor the inferior character of the American generals and officers in the\r\nwar; men appointed to offices for which they had no qualifications, and\r\nto situations in which they could, without stint, rob their country of\r\nits money, if not of its reputation.\r\n\r\nIn New York, a Convention of delegates from several counties of the\r\nState was held at Albany, on the 17th and 18th days of September, 1812,\r\nin which the war was denounced as unjustifiable, unprincipled, and\r\nunpatriotic, and as subservient, simply subservient to the cause of the\r\nFrench Emperor against England.[186]\r\n\r\nThe address of the House of Representatives of the State of\r\nMassachusetts presented in a still stronger light and with unanswerable\r\nargument the causes of this unjust and cruel war, as wanton and\r\nunprovoked, and the climax of the various outrages committed against\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nYet even the English Orders in Council--made the pretext for the war by\r\nPresident Madison and his partizans--impolitic as those Orders were on\r\nthe part of England, being founded not on sound national policy, but\r\ndictated by revenge on Napoleon on account of his Berlin and Milan\r\ndecrees for the destruction of British commerce--even these British\r\nOrders in Council were actually a source of profit to American\r\nmerchants from the indulgent way in which they were administered by the\r\nBritish authorities. The American historian, Hildreth, says:\r\n\r\n\"The comparative indulgence of the British, their willingness to allow\r\nto Americans a certain margin of profitable employment, contrasted very\r\nfavourably in the minds of ship-owners with the totally anti-commercial\r\nsystem of France. Forgetting their late pretensions to a neutral trade,\r\nperfectly unshackled, and the loud outcry they had raised against\r\nBritish invasions of it, they were now ready, with characteristic\r\ncommercial prudence, to accept as much of the views of British Ministers\r\nand merchants still left within their reach. A trade still profitable,\r\nhowever shackled and curtailed, they regarded as decidedly preferable to\r\nno trade at all. In fact, by the calculations of eminent merchants,\r\nfully confirmed by subsequent experience, the trade still allowed under\r\nthe British Orders, while far more profitable, was also quite as\r\nextensive as there could be any reasonable expectation of enjoying after\r\nthe restoration of general peace.\r\n\r\n\"The merchants and ship-owners had, however, but a limited influence\r\nover public opinion. Their vast profits of late years had made them\r\nobjects of envy. Though their accumulations were but an index of the\r\ngeneral enrichment of the nation, there were multitudes who more or less\r\nopenly rejoiced over their present distress [arising from the American\r\nembargo.] Unfortunately, too, they were divided among themselves. Some\r\neven of the wealthiest of their number were among those who applauded\r\nthe embargo, of which conduct this not very charitable explanation was\r\ngiven: that it would enable those who were able to wait for the revival\r\nof trade to buy up at a great discount the ships and produce of their\r\npoorer neighbours.\"[188]\r\n\r\nPresident Madison having declared a professedly defensive war against\r\nGreat Britain for the purpose of defending maritime rights on the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, commenced by invading Canada in three \"Grand Armies.\"\r\nThe one was the Grand Army of the West, consisting of 5,000 men, under\r\nGeneral Hull, and the base of whose operations was Detroit; the second\r\nwas the Grand Army of the Centre, under the command of General Van\r\nRensellaer, consisting of 5,000, which was to operate against Canada\r\nfrom Lewiston; and the third, but first in command, was the Grand Army\r\nof the North, under General Dearborn, consisting of 10,000 men, to\r\noperate from Lake Champlain against Montreal and the rest of Lower\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the declaration of war against England by President\r\nMadison and his democratic faction; such were the false pretensions for\r\nthe war; such was the confederacy between the democratic President of\r\nthe United States and the Tyrant of Europe against the liberties of\r\nmankind, under pretence of war with England; such was the noble\r\nopposition of the States of New York and New England to that unholy\r\ncoalition between the American President and the oppressor of Europe\r\nagainst human liberty--States which had been the head and the sinews and\r\nthe backbone of American resistance to Great Britain during the struggle\r\nfor American independence, and which, having achieved that independence,\r\nabhorred being buccaneers against the independence of Canada, and the\r\nacquisition of the Indian territories of the West and North of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: In the report of the Committee recommending the Bill for\r\nthe declaration, it was, of course, attempted to make England the\r\naggressive and the United States the injured party. \"On presentation of\r\nthis report,\" says Lossing, \"the doors were closed, and a motion to open\r\nthem was denied by a vote of seventy-seven against forty-nine. Mr.\r\nCalhoun [the democratic leader of the war party of the South] then\r\npresented a Bill, as part of the report, declaring war between Great\r\nBritain and her dependencies and the United States and its territories.\r\nAmendments were offered. Ten votes were given for a proposition by Mr.\r\nMcKee, of Kentucky, to include France. Mr. Quincy (of Boston)\r\nendeavoured, by an addition to the Bill, to provide for the repeal of\r\nall restrictive laws bearing upon commerce; and John Randolph, of\r\nVirginia, moved to postpone the whole matter until the following\r\nOctober. All were rejected, and the Bill, as Mr. Calhoun presented it,\r\nwas passed on the 4th day of June by a vote of seventy-nine for it and\r\nthirty-nine against it.\r\n\r\n\"When the Bill reached the Senate it was referred to a Committee already\r\nappointed to consider the President's message. It remained under\r\ndiscussion twelve days. Meanwhile the people throughout the country were\r\nfearfully excited by conflicting emotions. A memorial against the war\r\nwent from the Legislature of Massachusetts; and another from the\r\nmerchants of New York, led by John Jacob Astor. War-meetings were held\r\nin various places, and the whole country was in a tumult of excitement.\r\nFinally, on the 17th of June, the Bill, with some amendments, was passed\r\nin the Senate by a vote of nineteen against thirteen. It was sent back\r\nto the House on the morning of the 18th, when the amendments were\r\nconcurred in. The Bill was engrossed on parchment, and at three o'clock\r\nin the afternoon of that day became law by the signature of the\r\nPresident [who next day declared war against Great Britain]. In the\r\nHouse, the members from Pennsylvania, and the States of the South and\r\nWest, gave sixty-two votes for it to seventeen against it. In the\r\nSenate, the same States gave fourteen for it, to five against it,\r\n'Thus,' says a late writer [Edwin Williams], 'the war may be said to\r\nhave been a measure of the South and West to take care of the interests\r\nof the North, much against the will of the latter.'\" (Lossing's Field\r\nBook of the War of 1812, Chap. xi., pp. 227, 228.)\r\n\r\nThe minority of the members of the House of Representatives who voted\r\nagainst the war, addressed a protest, signed by them all, to their\r\nconstituents, exposing the impolicy and objects of the war, and\r\nindicating their own conduct. We quote two sentences of this able paper:\r\n\r\n\"As to the invasion and seizure of Canada, which was a part of the\r\nprogramme of the war party, they considered an attempt to carry out that\r\nmeasure as unjust and impolitic in itself, very uncertain in the issue,\r\nand unpromising as to any good results.\"--\"It cannot be concealed that\r\nto engage in the present war against England is to place ourselves on\r\nthe side of France, and expose us to the vassalage of States serving\r\nunder the banner of the French Emperor.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: The distinguished Joseph Quincy, of Boston, leader of the\r\nFederalist party, said, in his place in Congress, \"I have evidence\r\nsatisfactory in my own mind, that the Secretary of War has made it a\r\nprinciple not to appoint any man to a command in that army who is not an\r\nopen partizan of the existing Administration. If it be denied, appoint a\r\nCommittee of Inquiry. If the intention had been to unite the nation as\r\none man against a foreign enemy, is not this the last policy that any\r\nAdministration ought ever to have adopted? Is not a partizan army the\r\nmost dreadful and detestable of all engines, and most likely to awaken\r\nsuspicions and to inspire discontent?\" (Hildreth, Second Series, Vol.\r\nIII., Chap. xxi., p. 123.)\r\n\r\n\"The place of the first major-general, with the command of the Northern\r\nDepartment, had been given to the petted favourite, Henry Dearborn, late\r\nSecretary of War, and, since Madison's accession, collector of the port\r\nof Boston--a lucrative post, kept in his family by his son's appointment\r\nto it.\"--\"Wilkinson, the senior brigadier, just acquitted by\r\ncourt-martial of long-pending charges against him, had been sent to New\r\nOrleans [afterwards to Canada] to relieve Hampton [who was afterwards\r\nsent to Canada], whose command there had been a constant scene of\r\ncollision and turmoil with his officers. Commissions as brigadiers,\r\nunder the late Acts, had been given to Bloomfield, Governor of New\r\nJersey; to James Winchester, of Tennessee; and to Hull, Governor of\r\nMichigan Territory. * * Hampton and Smythe had been civilians for more\r\nthan thirty years, and were indebted for their present appointments\r\nrather to political than to military considerations. Of the inferiors of\r\nthe old army, presently distinguished, Alexander MacNab, of the\r\nEngineers, was now a colonel, and Winfield Scott and Edmund Gaines\r\nlieutenant-colonels. A lieutenant-colonelcy in one of the new regiments\r\nhad been given to Eleazar W. Ripley, a young Democrat from Maine, who\r\nhad succeeded Storey, of the late Democratic Massachusetts House of\r\nRepresentatives. Ripley's subsequent conduct justified his appointment;\r\nbut the colonel of that same regiment was afterwards cashiered for\r\npeculation; and as few of the new regimental officers had any military\r\nknowledge, so numbers of them were quite destitute of those qualities\r\nwithout which even that knowledge would have been of little avail.\"\r\n(Hildreth's History of the United States, Second Series, Vol. III.,\r\nChap, xxiv., pp. 308-310.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: \"The following are extracts from the resolutions of this\r\nfamous Convention:\r\n\r\n\"Taking solely into consideration the time and circumstances of the\r\ndeclaration of the present war, the condition of the country, and state\r\nof the public mind, we are constrained to consider, and feel it our duty\r\nto pronounce it a most rash, unwise, and inexpedient measure, the\r\nadoption of which ought forever to deprive its authors of the esteem and\r\nconfidence of an enlightened people; because, as the injuries we have\r\nreceived from France are at least equal in amount to those we have\r\nsustained from England, and have been attended with circumstances of\r\nstill greater insult and aggravation, if war were necessary to vindicate\r\nthe honour of the country, consistency and impartiality required that\r\nboth nations should have been included in the declaration; because, if\r\nit were deemed expedient to exercise our right of selecting our\r\nadversary, prudence and common sense dictated the choice of an enemy\r\nfrom whose hostility we had nothing to dread. A war with France would\r\nequally have satisfied our insulted honour, and at the same time,\r\ninstead of annihilating, would have revived and extended our commerce;\r\nand even the evils of such a contest would have been mitigated by the\r\nsublime consolation, that, by our efforts, we were contributing to\r\narrest the progress of despotism in Europe, and essentially serving the\r\ngreat interests of freedom and humanity throughout the world;\" * *\r\n\"because, before the war was declared, it was perfectly well ascertained\r\nthat a vast majority of the people in the Middle and Northern States, by\r\nwhom the burden and expenses of the war must be borne almost\r\nexclusively, were strongly opposed to the measure.\" * *\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the late revocation of British Orders in Council has removed\r\nthe great and ostensible cause of the present war, and prepared the way\r\nfor an immediate accommodation of existing differences, inasmuch as, by\r\nthe concession of the present Secretary of State, satisfactory and\r\nhonourable arrangements might easily be made, by which abuses resulting\r\nfrom the impressment of our seamen might in future be effectually\r\nprevented. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved,--That we shall be constrained to consider the determination\r\non the part of our rulers to continue the present war, after official\r\nnotice of revocation of the British Orders in Council, as affording\r\nconclusive evidence that the war has been undertaken from motives\r\nentirely distinct from those which have been hitherto avowed, and for\r\nthe promotion of objects wholly unconnected with the interest and honour\r\nof America.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved,--That we contemplate with abhorrence even the possibility of\r\nan alliance with the present Emperor of France, every action of whose\r\nlife has demonstrated, that the attainment, by any means, of universal\r\nempire, and the consequent extinction of every vestige of freedom, are\r\nthe sole objects of his incessant, unbounded, and remorseless ambition.\r\nHis arms, with the spirit of freemen, we might openly and fearlessly\r\nencounter; but of his secret arts, his corrupting influences, we\r\nentertain a dread we can neither conquer nor conceal. It is therefore\r\nwith the utmost distrust and alarm that we regard his late professions\r\nof attachment and love to the American people, fully recollecting that\r\nhis invariable course has been, by perfidious offers of protection, by\r\ndeceitful professions of friendship, to lull his intended victims into\r\nthe fatal sleep of confidence and security, during which the chains of\r\ndespotism are silently wound round and riveted on them.\r\n\r\n(Signed)   \"JACOB MORRIS, _President_.\r\n           \"WILLIAM HENDERSON, _Secretary_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: These Orders in Council were cancelled five days after\r\nPresident Madison's declaration of war--weeks before that declaration\r\ncould have been known in England.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: Hildreth's History of the United States, Second Series,\r\nVol. III., Chap. xxi., pp. 86, 87.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS BY CANADA AGAINST THE AMERICAN INVASIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LOWER CANADA.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes our duty to state the preparations made by the Canadians\r\nfor their own defence against the American invasions. Though so few in\r\nnumber and modest in pretensions to their multitudinous and boasting\r\ninvaders, they had the hearts of freemen and patriots, and trusted to\r\nthe Divine blessing in the justness of their cause.[189] We shall notice\r\nfirst the preparations of Lower Canada, and then those of Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nSir George Prevost, in the autumn of 1811, succeeded Sir James H. Craig\r\nin the government of Lower Canada, and in the chief command of the North\r\nAmerican provinces. He had been Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia. The\r\nknown mildness of his character, and the popularity of his\r\nadministration in Nova Scotia, caused his arrival at Quebec to be\r\nheartily welcomed by the friends of just and liberal government. The\r\nnarrow-mindedness and harshness of Sir James Craig's administration had\r\ncaused serious agitation and differences in Lower Canada, which Sir\r\nGeorge Prevost, by his impartiality and kindness, soon succeeded in\r\nallaying and reconciling. He called the first meeting of the Legislature\r\non the 21st of February, 1812, and, in his opening speech, stated that\r\nhe had hastened, in obedience to his orders, to assume the\r\nadministration of Lower Canada; congratulated the Legislature on the\r\nbrilliant achievements of the British arms in rescuing Portugal and\r\nSpain \"from the tyranny of the Ruler of France;\" and recommended an\r\nincreased and unremitted care and vigilance in securing the country from\r\neither open invasion or insidious aggression, and hoped the Parliament\r\nwould testify its loyalty by an early attention to those Acts which\r\nexperience had proved essential for the preservation of his Majesty's\r\ngovernment, as also by its readiness in supplying the Government with\r\nsuch aid as should be suitable to the exigence of the times, by enabling\r\nthe loyal Canadian subjects to assist in repelling any sudden attack\r\nmade by a tumultuary invasion, and effectually to participate in the\r\ndefence of their country against a regular invasion at any future\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, in answer, among other things assured the Governor that\r\nthey would give attention to those acts recommended by him. The Assembly\r\npassed a Militia Bill, by which the Governor was authorized to embody\r\n2,000 unmarried men, between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five years,\r\nfor three months in the year; and in case of invasion or imminent\r\ndanger, to retain them for one year, relieving one-half the number\r\nembodied, by fresh drafts at the expiration of that period. In the event\r\nof war, invasion, insurrection, or imminent danger thereof, he was\r\nempowered to embody the whole militia of the province, should it become\r\nnecessary. No substitutes were allowed, nor commissioned officers\r\npermitted to take any militiamen for their servants, under a penalty of\r\n£10 for every offence of that nature. These provisions, from their\r\nharshness and inconsistency, were, however, winked at in practice. It\r\nwas penal to enlist any militiamen into the regular forces, and such\r\nenlistments were declared null.\r\n\r\n_Twelve thousand pounds_ were granted by the Legislature, one moiety\r\nthereof for drilling and training the local militia, the other moiety\r\nfor other purposes of the Militia Act. _Twenty thousand pounds_ were\r\ngranted to be employed for such services as the safety of the province\r\nand the exigence of the times might require. And a further sum of\r\n_thirty thousand pounds_ currency, to be at the Governor's disposal in\r\ncase of war between Great Britain and America.\r\n\r\nThese liberal supplies enabled the Government to meet the approaching\r\ncrisis with confidence in the patriotism and support of the Provincial\r\nLegislature, and the whole mass of the Canadian population. In closing\r\nthe session, the Governor thanked the House for the labour they had\r\nbestowed upon the improvement of the militia system, and for the\r\nincreased means thereby afforded him for the defence of the province. He\r\nalso expressed his best thanks for the proofs he had received of their\r\nconfidence in his administration, by the liberal provision they had made\r\nfor the exigencies of the public service.[190]\r\n\r\nAfter the declaration of war by President Madison, June 19th, 1812,\r\nwhich was made known at Quebec the 28th of June, a notification was\r\nimmediately made by the police that all Americans must leave Quebec by\r\nthe 1st of July, and be out of the district by the 3rd of the same\r\nmonth. On the last day of June the period was extended by the Governor's\r\nproclamation; fourteen days were allowed to such Americans as were in\r\nthe province, they being principally persons who had entered the same in\r\ngood faith, and in prosecution of commercial pursuits.\r\n\r\n\"On the same day a proclamation issued imposing an embargo upon the\r\nshipping in port, and convoking the House of Assembly on the 16th of\r\nJuly.\"[191]\r\n\r\n\"At the opening of the session, the Governor, after informing the\r\nLegislature of the recent declaration of war by the United States\r\nagainst Great Britain, expressed his reliance upon the spirit of his\r\nMajesty's subjects in the province, their loyalty to their Sovereign,\r\nand their ardent love for the true interests of their country; and that\r\nhe should depend implicitly, under Divine Providence, upon their best\r\nexertions, aided by the courage and loyalty of the militia, and by the\r\nvalour, skill, and discipline of his Majesty's regular forces, for\r\nrepelling every hostile attempt that might be made upon the colony. He\r\nobserved with concern that the necessary establishment of the militia\r\nforces, together with the various services and operations of the\r\napproaching campaign, would be attended with considerable expense, but\r\nthat he relied upon their wisdom and public spirit for such supplies as\r\nthe exigencies of affairs might be found to require: he at the same time\r\nexpressed his approbation of the embodied militia, and his confidence in\r\ntheir increased discipline, which encouraged an expectation that they\r\nwould materially contribute to the defence of their country.\" * *\r\n\r\n\"A Bill to Facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills was introduced, and\r\nthe liberality of the House of Assembly surpassed the hopes of the\r\nExecutive. Fifteen thousand pounds were granted to pay the interest that\r\nmight become due upon army bills, of which £250,000 were authorized to\r\nbe put in circulation (large bills of twenty-five dollars and upwards\r\nbearing interest at the rate of fourpence per day for every hundred\r\npounds). They were made current in the revenue, were to have the effect\r\nof a legal tender, and were redeemable at the Army Bill Office, either\r\nin cash or Government bills of exchange on London, at the option of the\r\ncommander of the forces. Small bills of four dollars were at all times\r\npayable in cash at the Army Bill Office. On the 1st day of August, 1812,\r\nthis Bill received the royal sanction, and the Governor prorogued the\r\nParliament, with acknowledgments for the liberal aid they had granted\r\nhim to meet the exigencies of the public service.\"[192]\r\n\r\nSuch were the provisions made spontaneously, and with wonderful\r\nunanimity, in Lower Canada for the defence of the province against the\r\nimpending American invasion. These provisions were prior to\r\ncorresponding provisions made in Upper Canada, and the statement of\r\nwhich has been made in so much detail that the English reading public\r\nmight be reminded, or informed, of what has been too little known--the\r\nloyalty, liberality, and courage of the French as well as of the English\r\ninhabitants of Lower Canada, from the very beginning of the contest, and\r\nfollowed by deeds of heroism and fortitude (to be noticed hereafter),\r\nwhich successfully repelled successive American invasions, and prevented\r\nthe American armies, ten times as numerous as the Voltigeurs and all\r\nother Canadian volunteers, from gaining a single foothold in Lower\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. UPPER CANADA.\r\n\r\nUpper Canada was not second to Lower Canada. Sir Francis Gore left for\r\nEngland in 1811, and was succeeded by General Brock as President of\r\nUpper Canada, and commander of the forces, who called the Legislature\r\ntogether as early as possible after the declaration of war. Colonel John\r\nClarke, Adjutant-General of Militia, in his manuscripts (with the use of\r\nwhich I have been favoured by the learned and excellent librarian of the\r\nDominion at Ottawa, entitled \"U.E. Papers\"), says:\r\n\r\n\"Whilst the Americans were busily preparing for the campaign, we were\r\nnot idle in Canada. On the 27th of July, 1812, General Brock proceeded\r\nto York and called a meeting of the Legislature, to which he delivered\r\nan animated and spirited address, concluding with the following\r\nremarkable words:\r\n\r\n\"'We are engaged in an awful and eventful contest.\r\n\r\n\"'By unanimity and dispatch in our councils, and by vigour in our\r\noperations, we may teach the enemy this lesson, that a country defended\r\nby FREE MEN, enthusiastically devoted to the cause of their King and\r\nConstitution, cannot be conquered.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislature heartily responded to the noble appeal of General Brock\r\nat the opening of the session; passed the necessary Acts for the\r\nsecurity of the country, for the organization and training of the\r\nmilitia, and for the expenses and support of the war, and concluding\r\ntheir work by an earnest and patriotic address to the people of Upper\r\nCanada. We will extract some passages of this \"Address of the House of\r\nAssembly to the People of Upper Canada, on the Declaration of War.\" This\r\npowerful address, which occupies twelve pages, is signed \"Allan MacLean,\r\nSpeaker,\" and dated \"Commons House of Assembly, August 5th, 1812\"--just\r\nten days before General Brock took Detroit:\r\n\r\n\"The House of Assembly having nearly completed the necessary business\r\nfor which they were called together, beg leave, before they return home,\r\nto lift up their warning voice at this eventful crisis. The declaration\r\nof war issued against Great Britain by the United States, when first\r\nannounced, appeared to be an act of such astonishing folly and\r\ndesperation as to be altogether incredible, and not only excited the\r\ngreatest surprise among the inhabitants of this province, but among the\r\ngreat majority of our enemies themselves. That that Government,\r\nprofessing to be the friend of man and the great supporter of his\r\nliberty and independence, should light up the torch of war against the\r\nonly nation that stands between itself and destruction, exhibited a\r\ndegree of infatuation or madness, altogether incomprehensible. But the\r\nmen at present ruling the States, infatuated, or, as their more\r\nenlightened countrymen say, 'bribed by the Tyrant of France,' regardless\r\nof the best interests of their country, and the feelings and affections\r\nof a great majority of their own people, have commenced hostilities\r\nagainst our mother country whilst treating their vessels with\r\nhospitality, and instead of threatening their liberties, offering most\r\nequitable terms of accommodation.\r\n\r\n\"This war, on the part of the United States, includes an alliance with\r\nthe French usurper, whose dreadful policy has destroyed all that is\r\ngreat and good, memorable and holy, on the continent of Europe. The\r\ngovernment of this bloody tyrant penetrates into everything; it crushes\r\nindividuals as well as nations; fetters thoughts as well as motives; and\r\ndelights in destroying forever all that is fair and just in opinion and\r\nsentiment. It is evidently this tyrant who now directs the rulers of\r\nAmerica, and they show themselves worthy disciples of such a master.\" * *\r\n\r\n\"We turn with joy to you, many of whom have already risked your lives\r\nfor the unity of the empire. We are confident that the same spirit still\r\nanimates your breasts and those of your children--that you still retain\r\nthe same love of your excellent King, the same veneration for a free and\r\nhappy Constitution, that you exhibited during the American war. * * When\r\nwe picture to ourselves the sublime prospect the world would have\r\nexhibited this day, had the population of the neighbouring States\r\npreserved, like you, their filial love, we should not now behold the\r\ncontinent of Europe groaning under the yoke of a sanguinary tyrant, nor\r\nhis satellites in America studiously imitating his example.\r\n\r\n\"It is therefore from former experience that we look to you for the same\r\npatriotic principles--principles which enabled you to face death in its\r\nmost dreadful attire--principles which exalt human nature, and which\r\nhave been warmly cherished by the most virtuous and renowned of every\r\nage: and surely when we are attacked by the same enemies who once, aided\r\nby the mistaken lenity of the mother country and the misconduct of her\r\ncommanders, were able to drive us from our native homes and possessions\r\nto this province--a people whose lands are manured with the blood of our\r\nfriends and kinsmen, who drove our wives and children from their homes\r\nin the woods, or threw them into dungeons, and who now envy us the\r\nhabitations which, through the blessing of Providence, the beneficence\r\nof our parent state, and our own industry, we have gained from the\r\nwilderness, we are confident that you will display the same energy, and\r\ncertainly with better hopes of success. Great Britain will not now\r\nconsider such Americans as perverse children who may be reclaimed, but\r\nas her most malignant foes. Her commanders will not, as formerly,\r\ntemporize and raise hosts of enemies by their misconduct and delays, but\r\nthey will hasten to punish them with all the rigour of war.\r\n\r\n\"Already have we the joy to remark, that the spirit of loyalty has burst\r\nforth in all its ancient splendour. The militia in all parts of the\r\nprovince have volunteered their services with acclamation, and displayed\r\na degree of energy worthy of the British name. * * When men are called\r\nupon to defend everything they call precious--their wives and children,\r\ntheir friends and possessions--they ought to be inspired with the\r\nnoblest resolutions, and they will not be easily frightened by menaces,\r\nor conquered by force. And beholding, as we do, the flame of patriotism\r\nburning from one end of the Canadas to the other, we cannot but\r\nentertain the most pleasing anticipations.\r\n\r\n\"Our enemies have indeed said that they could subdue this country by\r\nProclamation; but it is our part to prove to them that they are sadly\r\nmistaken--that the population is determinedly hostile to them, and that\r\nthe few who might be otherwise inclined will find it their safety to be\r\nfaithful. * *\r\n\r\n\"Innumerable attempts will be made by falsehood to detach you from your\r\nallegiance; for our enemies, in imitation of their European master,\r\ntrust more to treachery than to force; and they will, no doubt, make use\r\nof many of those lies, which, unfortunately for the virtuous part of\r\nthese States, and the peace and happiness of the world, had too much\r\nsuccess during the American rebellion: they will tell you that they are\r\ncome to give you freedom--yes, the base slaves of the most contemptible\r\nfaction that ever distracted the affairs of any nation--the minions of\r\nthe very sycophants who lick the dust from the feet of Bonaparte will\r\ntell you that they are come to communicate the blessing of liberty to\r\nthis province; but you have only to look at your own situation to put\r\nsuch hypocrites to confusion. * *\r\n\r\n\"Trusting more to treachery than to open hostility, our enemies have\r\nalready spread their emissaries through the country, to seduce our\r\nfellow-subjects from their allegiance, by promises as false as the\r\nprinciples on which they are founded. A law has been enacted for the\r\nspeedy detection of such emissaries, and for their condign punishment\r\non conviction.\"[193]\r\n\r\n\"Remember, when you go forth to the combat, that you fight not for\r\nyourselves alone, but for the whole world. You are defeating the most\r\nformidable conspiracy against the civilization of man that was ever\r\ncontrived; a conspiracy threatening greater barbarism and misery than\r\nfollowed the downfall of the Roman Empire--that now you have an\r\nopportunity of proving your attachment to the parent state, which\r\ncontends for the relief of oppressed nations--the last pillar of true\r\nliberty, and the last refuge of oppressed humanity.\r\n\r\n(Signed)  \"ALLAN MACLEAN,\r\n\"_Speaker, Commons House of Assembly, August 5th, 1812._\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this manly and animated address to the people of Upper\r\nCanada was most beneficial, and contributed greatly to unite and\r\nencourage the people to face the struggle impending over them. There was\r\nno inflated boasting--no undervaluing of danger and sacrifice, but a\r\nplain statement of facts, and a heartfelt appeal to loyalty, patriotism,\r\nand manly courage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: \"A war with Great Britain had been long contemplated by\r\nthe rulers in America, and a seasonable moment only was sought for, to\r\ngrasp the provinces which they had fallaciously been induced to believe\r\nwere ripe for revolt, and would therefore fall a willing conquest to\r\nAmerica. The Peninsular war had engrossed the attention and resources of\r\nthe mother country, and the Canadas were necessarily the less provided\r\nwith means to encounter the struggle in which they were likely soon to\r\nbe engaged. The coffers were exhausted, nor were hopes entertained of\r\ntheir being speedily replenished from home; the regular forces were too\r\nthin to preserve an extensive frontier of some hundred miles against the\r\npressure of an enemy which, if united, must become irresistible; and the\r\nCanadians, though naturally brave and hardy, and attached to their\r\nConstitution, might from recent occurrences be fairly presumed to have\r\nbeen so far disgusted as to leave doubt of their hearty co-operation and\r\nzeal in the cause.\" (Christie's History of the War of 1812, Chap. iii.,\r\np. 48.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Christie's History of the War of 1812, Chap, iii., pp.\r\n49-53.\r\n\r\n\"The Governor, by a General Order of the 28th of May, 1812, organized\r\nfour battalions of embodied militia, in virtue of the late Act. The\r\nfirst battalion rendezvoused at Point-aux-Trembles, near Quebec, under\r\nthe command of Colonel De Salaberry; the second at Laprairie, near\r\nMontreal, commanded by Colonel De Rouville; the third at Berthier, in\r\nthe district of Montreal, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Cuthbert; and\r\nthe fourth at St. Thomas, near Quebec, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nTaschereau. The alacrity with which they were filled, and the\r\ncheerfulness with which the young men submitted to the restraints of\r\ndiscipline, reflected credit upon the military character of the\r\nCanadians. This proof of the zeal and the loyalty of the people inspired\r\nGovernment with hopes of successful resistance against the approaching\r\nwar, and a reciprocal confidence between the Governor and the people\r\nseems to have resulted, as much from the danger of the moment as from\r\nany studied policy on the part of the present Administration.

The\r\nAmerican Government had been for several months collecting an army of\r\nsome 3,000 or 4,000 regular troops and militia, around and west of\r\nDetroit, in order to strike a blow upon Canada the moment war should be\r\ndeclared. General Hull was the Governor of the territory of Michigan,\r\nand Commander-in-Chief of the \"Grand Army of the West.\" On the 12th of\r\nJuly he crossed the River Detroit with a force of 2,500 of the above\r\ntroops, and a strong park of artillery, and planted the American\r\nstandard on the shores of Canada, at Sandwich. He forthwith issued a\r\npretentious, inflated, cajoling, patronising, threatening proclamation\r\nto the inhabitants of Canada, and pronouncing instant death to any one\r\nwho should be fighting in company with the Indians, while at the same\r\ntime the Americans were employing in their army all the Indians they\r\ncould induce to join them. The American democratic party which ruled at\r\nWashington had persecuted and driven the fathers of Canada from their\r\nhomes in the United States, and had always been the enemies of their\r\npeace and prosperity in Canada; yet they were under the strange delusion\r\nthat the people of Canada must be still as much in love with them as\r\nthey were with themselves, and that the magnetism of their star-spangled\r\nbanner planted in Canada would draw all Canadians to it; that an\r\naddress from their commanding general would supply the place of armies,\r\nand that taking Canada would be but a holiday march, in which, as their\r\nlanguage of the time was, they would \"breakfast at Sandwich, take dinner\r\nat York (Toronto), and sup at Montreal.\" It was in this spirit of vanity\r\nand delusion that General Hull issued his famous proclamation, on his\r\nlanding at Sandwich, and which I give entire in a note.[194]\r\n\r\nIn a noble address to the people of Upper Canada, General Brock answered\r\nthe proclamation of General Hull, repelling and exposing with\r\noverwhelming power his misstatements, and answering with withering\r\nsarcasm General Hull's attack upon the Indians, and the \"barbarous and\r\nsavage policy of Great Britain\" in recognizing the Indians as allies and\r\nfellow-subjects, and their right to defend their homes and liberties\r\nagainst American invasion and rapine. We present the reader with the\r\nfollowing extracts of this masterly address, transcribed from the\r\nmanuscripts of the Dominion Library at Ottawa.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his Address to the People of Canada, General Brock\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America\r\nagainst Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies, has been\r\nfollowed by the actual invasion of this Province, in a remote frontier\r\nof the Western District, by a detachment of the armed force of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"The officer commanding that detachment [General Hull] has thought\r\nproper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and\r\nunresisting submission, but insults them by offering with a call to seek\r\nthe protection of his Government.\r\n\r\n\"Without condescending to notice the epithets bestowed, in this appeal\r\nof the American commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the\r\nadministration of his Majesty, every inhabitant of the Province is\r\ndesired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review\r\nof his own particular circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he\r\nhas been injured by the Government in his person, his property, or his\r\nliberty?\r\n\r\n\"Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so rapid in\r\nprosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years,\r\nby a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of\r\ntheir loyalty, not a descendant of these brave people is to be found who\r\nhas not, under the fostering care of their Sovereign, acquired a\r\nproperty and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\n\"This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost\r\nliberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people,\r\nhad not the maritime power of the mother country secured to the\r\ncolonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their\r\nlabour was in request. * *\r\n\r\n\"The restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the _stipulated_\r\nreward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies, now the United\r\nStates. The debt is still due; and there can be no doubt but that the\r\npledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages, or\r\nrather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the\r\ncommercial world.\r\n\r\n\"Are you prepared, inhabitants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or\r\nslaves, to the Despot who rules the nations of continental Europe with a\r\nrod of iron?\r\n\r\n\"If not, arise in a body; exert your energies; co-operate cordially with\r\nthe King's regular forces to repel the invader, and do not give cause to\r\nyour children, when groaning under the oppression of a Foreign Master,\r\nto reproach you with having so easily parted with the richest\r\ninheritance of this earth--a participation in the name, character, and\r\nfreedom of Britons. * *\r\n\r\n\"Be not dismayed at the unjustifiable threat of the commander of the\r\nenemy's forces, to refuse quarter should an Indian appear in the ranks.\r\n\r\n\"The brave bands of aborigines which inhabit this colony were, like his\r\nMajesty's other subjects, punished for their zeal and fidelity by the\r\nloss of their possessions in the late colonies, and rewarded by his\r\nMajesty with lands of superior value in this Province.\r\n\r\n\"The faith of the British Government has never been violated. The\r\nIndians feel that the soil they inherit is to them and their posterity\r\nprotected from the base arts so frequently devised to overreach their\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\n\"By what principle are they to be prohibited from defending their\r\nproperty? If their warfare, from being different to that of other\r\npeople, be more terrific to the enemy, let him retrace his steps; they\r\nseek him not--and cannot expect to find women and children in an\r\ninvading army.\r\n\r\n\"But they are men, and have equal rights with all other men to defend\r\nthemselves and their property when invaded, more especially when they\r\nfind in the enemy's camp a ferocious and mortal enemy, using the same\r\nwarfare which the American commander affects to reprobate.\r\n\r\n\"This inconsistent and unjustifiable threat of refusing quarter, for\r\nsuch a cause as being found in arms with a brother sufferer, in defence\r\nof invaded rights, must be exercised with the certain assurance of\r\nretaliation, not only in the limited operations of war in this part of\r\nthe King's dominions, but in every quarter of the globe; for the\r\nnational character of Britain is not less distinguished for humanity\r\nthan strict retributive justice, which will consider the execution of\r\nthis inhuman threat as deliberate murder, for which every subject of the\r\noffending power must make expiation.\r\n\r\n(Signed)   \"ISAAC BROCK,\r\n\"_Major-General and President_.\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS,\r\n\"Fort George, July 22nd, 1812.\"\r\n\"By order of his Honour the President,\r\n(Signed)   \"J.B.

The injuries and aggressions, the insults and\r\nindignities of Great Britain have once more left them no alternative but\r\nmanly resistance or unconditional submission. The army under my command\r\nhas invaded your country. The standard of the Union now waves over the\r\nterritory of Canada. To the peaceable, unoffending inhabitants it brings\r\nneither danger nor difficulty. I come to find enemies, not to make them;\r\nI come to protect, not to injure you.\r\n\r\n\"Separated by an immense ocean and an extensive wilderness from Great\r\nBritain, you have no participation in her councils, nor interest in her\r\nconduct. You have felt her tyranny; you have seen her injustice; but I\r\ndo not ask you to avenge the one, or to redress the other. The United\r\nStates are sufficiently powerful to afford every security consistent\r\nwith their and your expectations. I tender you the invaluable blessings\r\nof civil, religious, and political liberty, and their necessary\r\nresult--individual and general prosperity; that liberty which gave\r\ndecision to our councils and energy to our conduct, in a struggle for\r\nindependence--which conducted us safely and triumphantly through the\r\nstormy period of the revolution--the liberty which has raised us to our\r\nelevated rank among the nations of the world, and which afforded us a\r\ngreater measure of peace and security, of wealth and improvement, than\r\never fell to the lot of any people.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of my country and the authority of Government, I promise\r\nyou protection to your persons, property, and rights. Remain at your\r\nhomes; pursue your peaceful and customary avocations; raise not your\r\nhands against your brethren. Many of your fathers fought for the freedom\r\nand independence we now enjoy. Being children, therefore, of the same\r\nfamily with us, and heirs of the same heritage, the arrival of an army\r\nof friends must be hailed by you with a cordial welcome. You will be\r\nemancipated from tyranny and oppression, and restored to the dignified\r\nstatus of freemen.\r\n\r\n\"Had I any doubt of eventual success, I might ask your assistance; but I\r\ndo not. I come prepared for every contingency--I have a force which will\r\nbreak down all opposition, and that force is but the vanguard of a much\r\ngreater. If, contrary to your own interest, and the just expectations of\r\nmy country, you should take part in the approaching contest, you will be\r\nconsidered and treated as enemies, and the horrors and calamities of war\r\nwill stalk before you.\r\n\r\n\"If the barbarous and savage policy of Great Britain be pursued, and the\r\nsavages are let loose to murder our citizens, and butcher our women and\r\nchildren, this war will be a war of extermination. The first stroke of\r\nthe tomahawk, the first attempt with the scalping knife, will be the\r\nsignal of one indiscriminate scene of desolation. No white man found\r\nfighting by the side of an Indian will be taken prisoner--instant death\r\nwill be his lot. If the dictates of reason, duty, justice, and humanity,\r\ncannot prevent the employment of a force which respects no rights, and\r\nknows no wrongs, it will be prevented by a severe and relentless system\r\nof retaliation.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt not your courage and firmness. I will not doubt your attachment\r\nto liberty. If you tender your services voluntarily, they will be\r\naccepted readily. The United States offer you peace, liberty, and\r\nsecurity. Your chance lies between these and war, slavery, and\r\ndestruction. Choose, then, but choose wisely; and may He who knows the\r\njustice of our cause, and who holds in His hands the fate of nations,\r\nguide you to a result the most compatible with your rights and\r\ninterests, your peace and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"By the General,\r\nA.P. HULL.\"\r\n\r\n_Note._--It is a curious commentary on the above proclamation, that\r\nwithin six weeks of its being so pompously put forth, General Hull\r\nhimself, with all his army, was a prisoner in the hands of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, to whom was surrendered nearly\r\n3,000 prisoners, Fort Detroit, an immense quantity of arms and munitions\r\nof war, together with the whole territory of Michigan, and the secured\r\nalliance of the numerous Indian tribes to the west and north.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BROCK PREPARES FOR AN ATTACK ON DETROIT, AND WITH A SMALL FORCE\r\nTAKES GENERAL HULL AND HIS ARMY PRISONERS, AND ACQUIRES POSSESSION OF\r\nDETROIT AND THE TERRITORY OF MICHIGAN--INCIDENTS PRECEDING AND ATTENDING\r\nTHE TAKING OF DETROIT--GENERAL BROCK'S PROCLAMATION TO THE INHABITANTS\r\nOF THE MICHIGAN TERRITORY--HIS COUNCIL WITH THE INDIANS, AND\r\nCONVERSATION WITH THE GREAT CHIEF TECUMSEH, AND ESTIMATE OF HIM--GENERAL\r\nBROCK RETURNS TO YORK (TORONTO)--WHAT HE DID IN NINETEEN DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Brock did not content himself in replying to General Hull on\r\npaper, in defence of the British Government and the people of Canada; he\r\nanswered him in a more substantial way on the battle-field. General\r\nBrock lost no time in collecting the few soldiers in Upper Canada, and\r\nthe militia volunteers, and proceeding by boats, vessels, and by land,\r\nfrom Niagara to Detroit, to meet face to face the boasting commander of\r\nthe Grand Army of the West, and, in less than four weeks of his manly\r\nreply to Hull's inflated proclamation, he made Hull and all his army\r\nprisoners of war, with the surrender of the whole Michigan territory. It\r\nwas an achievement worthy of perpetual remembrance, that General Brock,\r\nwith forces hastily collected, \"consisting of thirty of the Royal\r\nArtillery with three six-pounders, under the command of Lieutenant\r\nTroughton, two hundred and fifty of the 41st Regiment, fifty of the\r\nNewfoundland Fencibles, and four hundred Canadian militia--in all\r\namounting to seven hundred and thirty, to whom six hundred Indians\r\nattached themselves--making an aggregate of one thousand three hundred\r\nand thirty;\" we say, it is an achievement worthy of all remembrance and\r\nhonour, that General Brock should, with such motley and slender forces,\r\ncross the Detroit river, and, by the skilful arrangement of his handful\r\nof soldiers, take, without shedding a drop of blood, a fort strongly\r\nprotected by--_iron_ ordnance, nine twenty-four-pounders, eight\r\ntwelve-pounders, five nine-pounders, three six-pounders; _brass_\r\nordnance, three six-pounders, two four-pounders, one three-pounder, one\r\neight-inch howitzer, one five and a-half inch howitzer--in all\r\nthirty-three pieces of ordnance; and defended by upwards of 2,500\r\nregular soldiers and militia.\r\n\r\nBut there was this essential difference between the two armies: the\r\nlittle Canadian army had homes, families, and liberties to defend,\r\nconnection with the mother country to maintain, and the consciousness of\r\nright; the great American army, with its fortifications, had the\r\nconsciousness of long-continued and wide-spread wrongs in depredations\r\nagainst their western Indian neighbours, bloated avarice for conquest,\r\nand inveterate hatred of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThere are several incidents connected with this remarkable military\r\nachievement. Mr. Thompson, in his History of the War of 1812, says:\r\n\"General Brock having made such arrangements, in the government of the\r\nprovince, as were necessary during his absence from York, proceeded\r\nthence to Fort George, and thence to _Long Point, on Lake Erie, where he\r\nwas joined by two hundred and sixty of the militia, who had, in a few\r\ndays, and in the very height of their harvest, gallantly volunteered\r\ntheir services to share the dangers of the field in defence of their\r\ncountry_, together with the detachment of the 41st Regiment, who had\r\nbeen previously sent to that quarter.\" (Thompson's History of the War of\r\n1812, p. 106.)\r\n\r\nAmong the 260 volunteers from the county of Norfolk--Long Point, Lake\r\nErie--were the elder brother and brother-in-law of the writer of these\r\npages (he being then ten years of age); the one of them was lieutenant\r\nand the other captain, who, with a great number of their neighbours,\r\nproceeded in a vessel from Port Ryerse to Amherstburg--making the\r\npassage in forty-eight hours--General Brock marching by land. The vessel\r\nwith the militia volunteers reached Amherstburg some five days before\r\nGeneral Brock, and, under the command of Colonel Proctor and the\r\ndirection of a skilful engineer, commenced erecting a battery at\r\nWindsor, opposite to Detroit, behind a tuft of trees which skirted the\r\nriver shore. Sentries were stationed at convenient distances along the\r\nnorth shore of the river, to prevent any intercourse with the American\r\nside; while the militia, officers and men, worked each night with the\r\nutmost quietness, in the erection of the battery, retiring at the\r\napproach of day. In four nights the battery was erected and mounted with\r\ncannon, when General Brock arrived, approved of what had been done,\r\ncalled a Council of the Indian allies, as well as of his officers, and\r\ndetermined forthwith to cross the river and attack Fort Detroit. The\r\nIndians were to cross in the night, which they did some three or four\r\nmiles below Detroit, and spread themselves in the woods that surrounded\r\nthe town, which then contained from 6,000 to 8,000 inhabitants. The\r\nnight-erected battery was unmasked by felling the trees and underwood in\r\nfront of it, when, to the astonishment and terror of the Americans, they\r\nsaw a battery fully equipped, and already firing effectually upon their\r\ntown and fort. Early in the morning of the 15th of August, General\r\nBrock, with his little army of 730 men (the militia being accoutred as\r\nregular soldiers), crossed the river unopposed about three miles below\r\nthe fort (which was in the centre of the town), and marched in order of\r\nbattle, under cover of corn fields, to within half a mile of the fort,\r\nfrom which, not cannon balls, but a flag of truce was sent out,\r\nproposing the surrender to the British commander of the fort, army,\r\ntown, and territory.[195]\r\n\r\nThe terrific war-whoop of the dreaded Indians, who seemed to swarm in\r\nthe woods around the town, filled the people and General Hull with\r\nirresistible terror; and at the very moment that General Hull was\r\nholding a council of war with his officers in a room within the fort, a\r\nshell, thrown from the British battery at Windsor, fell into the council\r\nroom, killed some officers, and wounded several more. This catastrophe,\r\nwith the terrible yells of the surrounding Indians, seemed to have\r\ndecided General Hull and his advisers that _surrender_ \"was the better\r\npart of valour.\"\r\n\r\nA _second_ incident connected with the surrender of Detroit and the\r\nMichigan territory is the council which General Brock held with the\r\nIndians the day before the attack upon and surrender of Detroit, and his\r\ninterview with them the day after, for the account of which I am\r\nindebted to Colonel John Clarke's manuscripts in the Dominion Library at\r\nOttawa:\r\n\r\n\"On General Brock's arrival at Sandwich, a council of war was assembled\r\non the following morning. Along with others were 1,000 Indians, whose\r\nequipment generally might be considered very imposing.\r\n\r\n\"The council was opened by General Brock, who informed the Indians that\r\nhe was ordered by their great Father, the King, to come to their\r\nassistance, and with them to drive the enemy from Fort Detroit. His\r\nspeech was highly applauded, and Tecumseh was unanimously called upon to\r\nspeak in reply. He commenced with expressing his joy that their great\r\nFather beyond the Salt Lake (meaning the King of England) had at length\r\nawoke from his long sleep, and sent his warriors to the assistance of\r\nhis red children, who had roused themselves in their honour, and were\r\nnow ready to shed the last drop of their blood in their great Father's\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\"Previously to passing over to Detroit, General Brock inquired of\r\nTecumseh what kind of country he should have to pass through, in the\r\nevent of his proceeding further. Tecumseh, taking a roll of elm bark,\r\nand extending it on the ground, drew forth his scalping knife, and\r\npresently etched upon the bark a plan of the country; which, if not so\r\nneat, was as fully intelligible as if a surveyor had prepared it.\r\nPleased with this talent in Tecumseh, and with his characteristic\r\nboldness, General Brock induced the Indians to cross the river for the\r\nattack on Detroit, prior to the embarkation of the white troops.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after Detroit was surrendered, General Brock took off his sash,\r\nand publicly placed it around the body of the chief Tecumseh, who\r\nreceived the honour conferred on him with evident gratification; but was\r\nseen the next day without his sash. The British general, fearing that\r\nsomething had displeased the Indian chief, sent his interpreter for an\r\nexplanation. Tecumseh told him that he did not wish to wear the sash as\r\na mark of distinction, when an older warrior than himself was present;\r\nhe had transferred the sash to the Wyandot chief, Roundhead.\r\n\r\n\"In his correspondence, General Brock states that 'of many Indians whom\r\nhe met at Amherstburg, he who most attracted his notice was the Shawnee\r\nchief, Tecumseh, brother of the Prophet--a more gallant or sagacious\r\nwarrior does not, I believe, exist; he was the admiration of every one,\r\nand was as humane as he was brave.'\r\n\r\n\"General Brock, in General Orders of the 16th of August, 1812, after the\r\ncapture of Detroit, states that two fortifications had been already\r\ncaptured, Michilimackinac and Detroit, without a drop of blood being\r\nshed by the hands of the Indians; the moment the enemy surrendered, his\r\nlife became sacred.\r\n\r\n\"On congratulating General Brock, after the capture of Detroit, Tecumseh\r\nsaid to the General, 'We observed you from a distance standing the whole\r\ntime in an erect position, and when the boats reached the shore, you\r\nwere the first man on the land; your bold and sudden movements\r\nfrightened the enemy, and so compelled them to surrender to half their\r\nnumber.'\r\n\r\n\"General Brock engaged the Indians to throw away the scalping\r\nknife--implanting in their hearts the virtue of clemency, and teaching\r\nthem to feel pleasure and pride in compassion extended to a vanquished\r\nenemy. In return, they revered him as their common Father, and whilst\r\nunder his control, were guilty of no excesses; and thereby the noble\r\nTecumseh was humane as well as brave.\"[196]\r\n\r\nSuch was the character and results of the first American invasion of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to notice some events which preceded the taking of\r\nDetroit, and which doubtless disappointed and disheartened General Hull.\r\nIn the island of St. Joseph, in Lake Huron, there was a fort or\r\nblock-house, under the command of Captain Roberts, with thirty regulars.\r\nGeneral Brock, in communicating to Captain Roberts the American\r\ndeclaration of war against Great Britain, instructed him to take every\r\nprecaution for the protection of St. Joseph, and, if possible, to get\r\npossession of Michilimackinac, now called Mackinac, and pronounced\r\nMackinaw, an island about nine miles in circumference, commanding the\r\nentrance from Lake Huron into Lake Michigan, on which the Americans had\r\na fort with a captain in command, and a garrison of seventy-five men.\r\nCaptain Roberts was aided by Mr. Pothier, a gentlemen of the South-west\r\nFur Company, who volunteered his own services, attended by about 160\r\nCanadian voyageurs, and placed the contents of the stores at the\r\ndisposal of Captain Roberts, who, with his little armament, consisting\r\nof thirty regulars, two artillerymen and a sergeant, 160 Canadians, and\r\ntwo iron field-pieces, set out on the 16th of July with his flotilla of\r\nboats and canoes, convoyed by the _Caledonia_ brig, belonging to the\r\nNorth-West Company, loaded with stores and provisions. On the ensuing\r\nmorning he reached Mackinac, a distance of about forty miles, landed\r\nwithout opposition, and immediately summoned the garrison to surrender,\r\nwhich was complied with in a few minutes. Thus was this key of the West\r\ntaken without the effusion of a drop of blood.\r\n\r\nThe Americans had carried on a brisk trade in schooners and sailing\r\nvessels from Detroit, through Lake Huron, to the head of Lake Michigan,\r\nnow Chicago. The capture of Mackinac--which was a surprise to the\r\ncommander, who had not heard of the declaration of war--interrupted this\r\ntrade, and gave confidence to the Canadian voyageurs and Indians in the\r\nBritish interests employed in the fur trade in these distant countries.\r\n\r\n\"This achievement, effected by the promptitude and judicious\r\narrangements of Captain Roberts, not only inspired the people with\r\nconfidence, and gave a turn to the present campaign fatal to the views\r\nof the United States, by enabling us to maintain our influence among the\r\nIndians of the West, which otherwise must have been lost, but it\r\nessentially contributed to the successful struggle afterwards maintained\r\nagainst the American arms in Upper Canada. General Hull, after the\r\ncapture of his army and the fall of Detroit, in his official despatch\r\nrelative to these events, attributes his disasters to the fall of\r\nMackinac; after the surrender of which, almost every tribe and nation of\r\nIndians, except a part of the Miamis and Delawares, north from beyond\r\nLake Superior, west from beyond the Mississippi, south from Ohio and the\r\nWabash, and east from every part of Upper Canada, and from all the\r\nintermediate country, joined in open hostility against the army he\r\ncommanded.\"[197]\r\n\r\n\"General Hull remained some time inactive, under pretext of making\r\npreparation to prosecute the campaign with vigour; but it was the\r\nfallacious hope of an early insurrection in his favour that lulled him\r\ninto a supineness fatal to the safety of his army. Amherstburg lay about\r\neighteen miles below him, and the mud and picketed fortifications of\r\nthat post was not in a condition to make resistance against a regular\r\nsiege. The Americans, confident of an easy conquest, had not as yet a\r\nsingle cannon or mortar mounted, and to endeavour to take it at the\r\npoint of the bayonet he thought inexpedient. During this delay his\r\nsituation became more and more precarious; three detachments from his\r\narmy were, on three successive days, beaten back by a handful of the\r\n41st Regiment and a few Indians, from a bridge over the River Canard,\r\nthree miles from Amherstburg, which they endeavoured to seize, in order\r\nto open the route to that port. Another detachment, in attempting to\r\nford the river (Canard) higher up, was put to flight by a small party of\r\neighteen or twenty Indians who lay concealed in the grass. The enemy,\r\npanic-struck at their sudden and hideous yell, fled with precipitancy,\r\nleaving their arms, accoutrements, and haversacks. The British sloop of\r\nwar _Queen Charlotte_, carrying eighteen twenty-four pounders, lay in\r\nthe Detroit river, opposite the mouth of the River Canard, so that it\r\nwas impossible for the Americans to convey by water to Amherstburg any\r\nartillery, of which, after much labour, they had at last mounted two\r\ntwenty-four-pounders. Lieutenant Rolette, commanding the armed brig\r\n_Hunter_, had on the 3rd of July, at about ten o'clock in the forenoon,\r\nby a bold attempt in his barge, with only six men, succeeded in\r\ncapturing the _Cayahaga_ packet, bound from Miami river to Detroit with\r\ntroops, and loaded with baggage, and the hospital stores of the American\r\narmy, the loss of which was now severely felt. Mackinac, in his rear,\r\nhad been taken since the commencement of the invasion, while the Indians\r\nfrom that quarter were flocking to the British standard. Our naval force\r\nbeing superior on the lake, Colonel Proctor pushed over to Brownstown, a\r\nvillage nearly opposite to Amherstburg, twenty miles below Detroit,\r\nwith a small detachment of the 41st Regiment, under the command of\r\nCaptain Tallon, with a few Indians, who on the 5th of August surprised\r\nand routed a party of 200 Americans under Major Vanhorne, on their way\r\nfrom Detroit to River Raisin, to meet a detachment of volunteers from\r\nOhio, under Captain Brush, with a convoy of provisions for the army. In\r\nthis affair a quantity of booty, and General Hull's despatches to the\r\nSecretary at War, fell into the hands of the victors, whereby the\r\ndeplorable state of the American army was disclosed.\" * *\r\n\r\n\"In the interim, the American general received a despatch from General\r\nHull, on the Niagara frontier, intimating that he could not expect\r\nco-operation in that quarter, which would have created a diversion in\r\nhis favour. Such was the hopeless state of things when the American\r\ngeneral began to be sensible of his danger. His army hemmed in on every\r\nside, cut off from its resources, and hourly wasting away with defeat,\r\ndeath, sickness, and fatigue, unsupported by an expected insurrection of\r\nCanadians in his favour, and unaided by any co-operating army, and,\r\nabove all, dismayed at the report of General Brock's resolution to\r\nadvance against him; his schemes of conquest vanquished, and in the\r\nsinking state of his affairs, he saw no other alternative than to\r\nretreat back to Detroit, under pretence of concentrating his main army,\r\nand after re-opening his communications with the Rivers Raisin and\r\nMiami, through which he received his whole supplies, to resume offensive\r\noperations against Upper Canada. Accordingly, on the evening of the 7th\r\nand the morning of the 8th of August, the whole of his army, except a\r\ngarrison of 250 men and a few artillery left in charge of a small\r\nfortress they had thrown up on the British side, a little below Detroit,\r\n_recrossed the river_.\r\n\r\n\"General Hull now detached a body of 600 men, under Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMiller, to dislodge the British from Brownstown, and open the\r\ncommunication with the Rivers Raisin and Miami, upon which the existence\r\nof the army depended. On the 9th, this detachment was met by the British\r\nand Indians under Major Muir at Magnogo, between Brownstown and Detroit,\r\nwhich, after a desperate battle, in which the Americans lost\r\nseventy-five men, was obliged to retreat with inconsiderable loss\r\ncompared with that of the Americans.\r\n\r\n\"On the 7th, Lieutenant Rolette, with the boats of the _Queen Charlotte_\r\nand _Hunter_, under cover of the guns of the latter, attacked and\r\ncaptured a convoy of eleven batteaux and boats, having on board\r\nfifty-six of their wounded, and two English prisoners, on their way from\r\nMagnogo to Detroit, escorted by 250 American troops on shore.\r\n\r\n\"Amidst these reverses of fortune, the American general was startled at\r\nthe summons to surrender the fort of Detroit, by General Brock, who,\r\nafter having closed the public business at York, and prorogued\r\nParliament, and collecting a few regulars and militia with incredible\r\nexertion, had reached Amherstburg by the 13th of August. So resolute a\r\ndemand struck the American commander with dismay, who, at the most, had\r\nnever contemplated a pursuit into his own territory by the British. He\r\nstill, however, maintained sufficient presence of mind to return a\r\nprompt and positive refusal, upon receipt of which, the British, who now\r\noccupied the ground so lately in possession of the enemy, in front of\r\nDetroit, where they had thrown up a battery (erected by night) under the\r\ndirection of Captain Dixon, of the Royal Engineers, commenced, on the\r\nafternoon of the 15th, a brisk cannonade on Detroit, from two\r\nfive-and-a-half-inch mortars, and two twelve-pounders, under the\r\nmanagement of Captain Hall, of the Provincial Navy, with a party of\r\nsailors, which was continued for upwards of an hour with great effect.\r\nEarly in the morning of the 16th the cannonade recommenced, while\r\nGeneral Brock, with about 700 regulars and militia, and 600 Indians,\r\ncrossed the river without opposition at the Spring Wells, three miles\r\nbelow Detroit, under cover of the _Queen Charlotte_ and _Hunter_. This\r\nsmall but resolute force, after forming upon the beach, advanced in\r\ncolumn, flanked on the left by the Indians, with the river of Detroit on\r\ntheir right, and took (at the distance of a mile) position in line, in\r\nfront of the American fort, into which the enemy had retired. Here every\r\npreparation was making for an immediate assault, when, to the surprise\r\nof both armies, a white flag was seen flying upon the walls of the fort,\r\nand a messenger advancing with proposals from the American general to\r\n_capitulate_. Lieutenant-Colonel McDowell, of the Militia, and Major\r\nGlegg, of the 49th Regiment, aide-de-camp to General Brock, immediately\r\nproceeded by his orders to the tent of the American general, where, in\r\na few minutes, they dictated the terms of capitulation. By this the\r\nwhole American army, including a detachment of 350 men, under Colonels\r\nMcArthur and Cass, dispatched on the 14th for River Raisin to escort the\r\nprovisions in charge of Captain Brush from thence to Detroit, became\r\nprisoners of war; and Detroit, with the Michigan territory, were\r\nsurrendered to the British arms, without the effusion of a single drop\r\nof British blood.\r\n\r\n\"The American statements of their own strength nearly coincide with\r\nBritish reports, which make it 2,500 men, regulars and militia. The\r\nmilitia were paroled, and permitted to return home, on condition of not\r\nserving during the present war. The regulars were sent down to Quebec.\r\n\r\n\"The British force, including Indians, is acknowledged by the enemy to\r\nhave consisted of only 1,030 men or thereabout. Our own, and perhaps\r\nmore correct reports, state it to have consisted of 350 regular troops,\r\n400 militia, and 600 Indians, who, upon the present occasion, are said\r\nnot to have sullied the glory of the day by any wanton acts of savage\r\nbarbarity incident to the Indian mode of warfare. Twenty-five pieces of\r\niron and eight pieces of brass ordnance, with an immense quantity of\r\nstores of every description, and one armed brig, called the _John Adams_\r\n(afterwards named _Detroit_), fell into the hands of the British\"\r\n[besides nearly 3,000 stand of small arms, much ammunition, and three\r\nweeks' provisions for the whole army]. (Thompson's History of the War of\r\n1812, pp. 67-72.)\r\n\r\n\"Thus ended this (first) rash and imbecile attempt at the conquest of\r\nCanada. The loss of Mackinac and Detroit, with the flower of their army,\r\nat the outset of the war, was a disgrace that filled the American\r\nGovernment with consternation and alarm, as their plans of\r\naggrandisement were not only totally defeated, but their whole western\r\nfrontier was laid open to the inroads of the hostile Indians, and at the\r\nmercy of a people still warm with indignation at the late\r\ninvasion.\"--_Ib_., pp. 72, 73.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brock, the day after taking Detroit, addressed to the\r\ninhabitants of the Michigan territory the following Proclamation:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the territory of Michigan was this day, by capitulation, ceded\r\nto the arms of his Britannic Majesty, without any other condition than\r\nthe protection of private property; and wishing to give an early proof\r\nof the moderation and justice of his Majesty's government, I do hereby\r\nannounce to all the inhabitants of the said territory, that the laws\r\nheretofore in existence shall continue in force until his Majesty's\r\npleasure be known, and so long as the peace and safety of the said\r\nterritory will admit thereof; and I do hereby also declare and make\r\nknown to the said inhabitants, that they shall be protected in the full\r\nexercise and enjoyment of their religion--of which all persons, both\r\ncivil and military, will take notice, and govern themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"All persons having in their possession, or having knowledge of any\r\npublic property, shall forthwith deliver in the same, or give notice\r\nthereof to the officer commanding, or to Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholl, who\r\nare duly authorized to receive and give the proper receipts for the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\"Officers of militia will be held responsible that all arms in\r\npossession of the militiamen be immediately delivered up; and all\r\nindividuals whatever who have in possession arms of any kind, will\r\ndeliver them up without delay.\r\n\r\n\"Given under my hand, at Detroit, this 16th day of August, 1812, and in\r\nthe 52nd year of his Majesty's reign. God save the King.\r\n\r\n(Signed)  \"ISAAC BROCK,\r\n\"_Major-General_.\"\r\n\r\nThe purport and spirit of this proclamation was very different from\r\nthose issued by successful American commanders in former years, when\r\nthey required the conquered to take a new oath of allegiance, to enrol\r\nthemselves in a new army under pain of confiscation of property,\r\nimprisonment, and even death. The true genius of English government is\r\njustice, law, and liberty; the genius of democratic government is the\r\ndomination of party, and the spoils to the victors. In the conquest of a\r\nvast territory by General Brock, there was no plunder or sacrifice of\r\nlife, by Indian or soldier, much less plunder for the benefit of the\r\ngeneral. It was not so with the promising, threatening, ostentatious,\r\ngrasping General Hull, who, according to the Patriotic Society of Upper\r\nCanada (of which hereafter), is thus reported:\r\n\r\n\"In 1812, General Hull invaded the British province of Upper Canada, and\r\ntook possession of the town of Sandwich. He threatened (by proclamation)\r\n_to exterminate the inhabitants if they made any resistance_. _He\r\nplundered_ those with whom he had been on habits of intimacy years\r\nbefore the war. Their plate and linen were found in his possession after\r\nhis surrender to General Brock. He marked out the loyal subjects of the\r\nKing as objects of his peculiar resentment, and consigned their property\r\nto pillage and conflagration.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Brock left Colonel Proctor in command of Detroit, and returned\r\nto York (Toronto), where he arrived the 27th of August, amidst the\r\nheartfelt acclamations of a grateful people.\r\n\r\n\"In the short space of nineteen days he had, with the assistance of the\r\nProvincial Parliament, settled the public business of the province,\r\nunder the most trying circumstances that a commander could encounter,\r\nand having united and prepared his little army, had effected a long and\r\nfatiguing march of several hundred miles; and with means incredibly\r\nlimited, had repelled an invading enemy of double his force, pursued him\r\ninto his own territory, and finally compelled him to surrender his whole\r\narmy and jurisdiction; thus extending the British dominions, without\r\nbloodshed, over an extent of territory almost equal to Upper\r\nCanada.\"--\"Our little navy on Lake Erie, and on Lake Ontario, though the\r\nenemy were making the most active exertions, still maintained a decided\r\nascendency, and upon it depended the safety of Upper Canada and the\r\nfuture fate of the British provinces. General Brock intended to have\r\nfollowed up his first success by an attempt on Niagara, a fort nearly\r\nopposite to Fort George; which, in all probability, as well as Oswego\r\nand Sackett's Harbour, the nursery of the enemy's fleet and forces,\r\nwould have yielded to the terror of his name and the tide of success\r\nthat attended his arms; but, _controlled by his instructions_, he was\r\nprevented from adopting measures which probably might have for ever\r\nblasted the hopes of the United States in Upper Canada.\" (Christie.)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: The brother-in-law and elder brother of the writer were\r\nordered by General Brock to select the fleetest horses of those captured\r\nfrom the Americans, in order to convey the intelligence of the capture\r\nof Detroit, and of General Hull and army, to Colonel Talbot, at Port\r\nTalbot, and to General Vincent, commander of the forces at Burlington\r\nHeights. They had wrought all night before they received their orders,\r\nand travelled, one of them two days and two nights, and the other two\r\nnights and three days without sleep. But these deeds were not peculiar;\r\nsimilar deeds were performed on the Niagara and Lower Canada frontiers\r\nduring that and the following years. The Loyalist defenders of Canada of\r\nthose days were patriots and soldiers to the heart's core; and they had\r\nwills, and nerves, and muscles \"to endure hardness as good soldiers,\" in\r\nthe hardest and darkest hours of our country's trials and struggles.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, that the horse on which the elder brother of the writer\r\nof these pages rode, in execution of the orders of General Brock, was\r\nafterwards stolen by the traitor Wilcox, who escaped to the United\r\nStates, but was afterwards killed while invading Fort Erie.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: I think the reader will be interested in the following\r\nparticulars, which I have collected of this remarkable Indian Chief:\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1809, Tecumseh, attended by several hundred warriors,\r\nencamped near Vincennes, then capital of Indiana, and demanded an\r\ninterview with the Governor of the State; for which interview was\r\nassembled a Council, when it was observed there was no vacant seat for\r\nthe noble chief, Tecumseh. One of the Council officers hastily offered\r\nhis seat, and having respectfully said to him, 'Warrior, your Father,\r\nGeneral Harrison, offers you a seat.' 'My Father,' exclaimed Tecumseh,\r\nextending his arms towards the heavens, 'There, son, is my Father, and\r\nthe earth is my mother; she giving me nourishment, and I dwell upon her\r\nbosom.' He then sat himself upon the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indian warrior Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief, himself and warriors,\r\nattached themselves to the cause of Great Britain, on the declaration of\r\nthe American war of 1812. * *\r\n\r\n\"Tecumseh's first engagement, under the British Colonel Proctor, then in\r\ncommand of the Western District, was attacking and defeating a\r\ndetachment of Americans under Major Howe, from Detroit to the Beaver\r\nriver. In this affair, General Hull's despatches, and correspondence of\r\nhis troops, fell into the hands of Tecumseh; and it was partly from the\r\ndiscouraging nature of their contents that General Brock attempted the\r\ncapture of the American army under General Hull.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 16th of July, Tecumseh and a few of his warriors pursued near\r\nSandwich [on the Canadian side of the river] a detachment of the\r\nAmerican army, under Colonel McArthur, and fired on the rear guard. 'The\r\ncolonel suddenly faced about and gave orders for a volley, when all the\r\nIndians fell flat on the ground, with the exception of Tecumseh, who\r\nstood firm on his feet, with apparent unconcern.\"\r\n\r\n\"As Colonel Proctor retired to Nassau (Moravian town), on the Thames,\r\nand when the regulars and militia had surrendered on the right, the\r\nIndians carried on the contest on the left, and did not retreat until\r\nthe day was lost, and thirty-three of their number had been slain,\r\nincluding the noble warrior, Tecumseh. After his fall, his lifeless\r\ncorpse was recovered with great interest by the American officers, who\r\ndeclared that the contour of his features was majestic even in death. He\r\nleft a son who fought by his side when he fell, and was seventeen years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince Regent, in 1815, as a mark of respect to the memory of his\r\nfather, sent a handsome sword as a present to his son.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: Christie's War of 1812, pp. 65, 66.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nSECOND AMERICAN INVASION OF UPPER CANADA AT QUEENSTON--DISPROPORTION OF\r\nAMERICAN AND CANADIAN FORCES--DEATH OF GENERAL BROCK--DEFEAT AND LOSS OF\r\nTHE AMERICANS--ARMISTICE--INCIDENTS WHICH OCCURRED ON THE NIAGARA\r\nFRONTIER, AT FORT ERIE, AS RELATED BY LIEUTENANT DRISCOLL, OF THE 100TH\r\nREGIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _second invasion_ of Upper Canada took place on the Niagara\r\nfrontier, at Queenston. We will give the account of it (condensed) from\r\nthe History of the War by Mr. Thompson, of the Royal Scots:\r\n\r\n\"Dispirited at such a total failure in General Hull's expedition, it\r\nbecame late in the season before the American Government could collect a\r\nforce on the frontiers with which, with any safety, another descent upon\r\nCanada could be made. At length, Major-General Van Rensellaer, of the\r\nNew York Militia, with a force of _four thousand men_ under his command\r\n(1,500 of whom were regular troops), established his camp at Lewiston,\r\non the Niagara river, nearly half-way between Lake Ontario and the\r\nFalls.\r\n\r\n\"Before daylight on the morning of the 13th of October, a large division\r\nof General Van Rensellaer's army, under Brigadier-General Wadsworth,\r\neffected a landing at the lower end of the village of Queenston\r\n(opposite to Lewiston), and made an attack upon the position, which was\r\ndefended with the most determined bravery by the two flank companies of\r\nthe 49th Regiment, commanded by Captains Dennis and Williams, aided by\r\nsuch of the militia forces and Indians as could be collected in the\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\n\"Major-General Brock, on receiving intelligence, immediately proceeded\r\nto that post, from Fort George, and arrived at the juncture when the\r\nhandful of British regulars was compelled to retire for a time before an\r\noverwhelming force of the enemy. However, on the appearance of their\r\ngallant chief, the troops were seized with a fresh animation, and were\r\nled on by that brave general to a renewed exertion to maintain the post;\r\nbut at the moment of charging the enemy's position, within pistol-shot\r\nof the line, General Brock was killed by a musket ball, and with him the\r\nposition was for a short time lost. Colonel Macdonell, his provincial\r\naide-de-camp, was mortally wounded about the same time, and died shortly\r\nafterwards of his wounds.\r\n\r\n\"A reinforcement of the 41st Regiment, commanded by Captain Derenzy,\r\nwith a few of the Lincoln Militia and a party of Indians, were\r\nimmediately marched from Fort George to the succour of the troops at\r\nQueenston, under the direction of Major-General Sheaffe, who now assumed\r\nthe command; and persons who were, by their situations in life and\r\nadvanced age, exempt from serving in the militia, made common cause,\r\nseized their arms, and flew to the field of action as volunteers.\r\n\r\n\"The conflict was again renewed, and from the advantageous position of\r\nNorton, the Indian chief, with his warriors, on the woody brow of the\r\nhigh grounds, a communication was opened with Chippewa, from whence\r\nCaptain Bullock, of the 41st Regiment, with a detachment of that corps,\r\nwas enabled to march for Queenston, and was joined on the way by parties\r\nof militia who were repairing from all quarters, with all the enthusiasm\r\nimaginable, to the field of battle. The fight was maintained on both\r\nsides with a courage truly heroic. The British regulars and militia\r\ncharged in rapid succession against a force in number far exceeding\r\ntheir own, until they succeeded in turning the left flank of their\r\ncolumn, which rested on the summit of the hill. The event of the day no\r\nlonger appeared doubtful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Major-General Van Rensellaer, commanding the American army, perceiving\r\nhis reinforcements embarking very slowly, recrossed the Niagara river to\r\naccelerate their movements; but, to his utter astonishment, he found\r\nthat at the very moment when their services were most required, the\r\nardour of the engaged troops had entirely subsided. He rode in all\r\ndirections through his camp, urging the men by every consideration to\r\npass over. Lieutenant-Colonel Bloome, who had been wounded in the\r\naction and recrossed the river, together with Judge Peck, who happened\r\nto be in Lewiston at the time, mounted their horses and rode through the\r\ncamp, exhorting the companies to proceed--_but all in vain_. Crowds of\r\nthe United States Militia remained on the American bank of the river, to\r\nwhich they had not been marched in any order, but run as a mob; _not one\r\nof them would cross_. They had seen the wounded re-crossing; they had\r\nseen the Indians, _and were panic-struck_.\" (American Report of the\r\nBattle of Queenston.)\r\n\r\n\"No sooner had the British forces succeeded in turning the left flank of\r\nthe enemy, than he visibly began to give way; one grand effort was\r\ntherefore made upon the crest of his position, in which the heights were\r\ncarried at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\n\"General Van Rensellaer, having found that it was impossible to induce a\r\nman to cross the river to reinforce the army on the heights, and that\r\nthe army had nearly expended its ammunition, immediately sent boats to\r\ncover their retreat; but the fire, which was maintained upon the ferry\r\nfrom a battery on the bank of the lower end of Queenston, completely\r\ndispersed the boats, and many of the boatmen re-landed and fled in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\"Brigadier-General Wadsworth was therefore compelled, after a vigorous\r\nconflict had been maintained for some time on both sides, to surrender\r\nhimself and all his officers, with 900 men, between three and four\r\no'clock in the afternoon, to a force far inferior to his in numbers--a\r\ncircumstance which speaks loudly in favour of the plan of defence and\r\nattack adopted by Major-General Sheaffe.\r\n\r\n\"The loss of the British in this battle did not exceed 100 men,\r\nincluding killed, wounded, and missing; while that on the side of the\r\nAmericans, including deserters, was not less than 2,000; but amongst the\r\nkilled, the British Government and the country had to deplore the loss\r\nof Sir Isaac Brock, one whose memory will long live in the warmest\r\naffections of every British subject in Canada.\"[198]\r\n\r\n\"On the morning subsequent to the battle of Queenston, General Sheaffe\r\nentered into an armistice with the American general commanding at\r\nLewiston, to be confined to that part of the frontier comprised between\r\nLakes Ontario and Erie, subject to a condition that forty-eight hours'\r\nnotice should be given by either party for a recommencement of\r\nhostilities [a condition violated by the American commander]. This\r\narrangement [considered disadvantageous to the British cause] was at\r\nfirst censured by individuals unaware of the motives by which General\r\nSheaffe was actuated. It was not, in the flush of victory, taken into\r\nconsideration that the number of American prisoners then in his charge\r\nfar exceeded the numerical strength of his army, when the Indian force\r\nwas withdrawn; and that, with his very limited means of defence, he had\r\na frontier of forty miles to protect.\"[199]\r\n\r\nBefore noticing the _third_ American invasion of Canada, in 1812, or the\r\nsecond on the Niagara frontier, we will conclude this Chapter by adding\r\na few incidents on the Niagara river frontier, at Fort Erie, after the\r\ndeath of General Brock, October 13, 1812, by Lieutenant Driscoll, of the\r\n100th Regiment:\r\n\r\n\"I was stationed at Fort Erie on the memorable 13th of October, 1812. At\r\ndaybreak, having returned with my escort as visiting rounds, after a\r\nmarch of about six miles in muddy roads through the forests, and about\r\nto refresh the inward man, after my fatiguing trudge, I heard a booming\r\nof distant artillery, very faintly articulated.\r\n\r\n\"Having satisfied myself of the certainty of my belief, hunger, wet, and\r\nfatigue were no longer remembered; excitement banishes these trifling\r\nmatters from the mind; and I posted off to my commanding officer to\r\nreport the firing, now more audible and rapid.\r\n\r\n\"I found my chief, booted, spurred, and snoring--lying, as was his wont,\r\non a small hair mattress on the floor in his barrack-room, which boasted\r\nof furniture, one oak table covered with green baize, a writing-desk, a\r\ntin basin containing water, and a brass candlestick, which had planted\r\nin it a regulation mutton-dip, dimly flickering its last ray of light,\r\npaling before the dawn, now making its first appearance through the\r\ncurtainless window.\r\n\r\n\"The noise I made on entering the major's sleeping and other apartment\r\nawoke him. As he sat up on his low mattrass, he said, 'What is the\r\nmatter?' 'Heavy firing down the river, sir.' 'Turn the men out.' 'All\r\nunder arms, sir.' 'That'll do.'\r\n\r\n\"By this time he was on his legs--his hat and gloves on. His hutman was\r\nat the door with his charger, and his spurs in his horse's flanks in an\r\ninstant--leaving the orderly, hutman, and myself to double after him up\r\nto the fort, some hundred yards off.\r\n\r\n\"As we reached it, the men were emerging through the gate in measured\r\ncadence, and we were on our way to the batteries, opposite the enemy's\r\nstation at Black Rock.\r\n\r\n\"Before we reached our post of alarm the sun was up and bright. We had\r\nnot assumed our position long before an orderly officer of the\r\nProvincial Dragoons rode up, and gave us the information that the enemy\r\nwere attempting to cross at Kingston, and that we must annoy them along\r\nthe whole line, as was being done from Niagara to Queenston, by any and\r\nevery means in our power short of crossing the river. Everything was\r\nready on our parts. The enemy all appeared asleep, judging from the\r\napparent quiet that prevailed on their side of the river.\r\n\r\n\"The command to annoy the enemy was no sooner given than, bang! bang!\r\nwent off every gun we had in position.\r\n\r\n\"Now there was a stir. The enemy's guns were in a short time manned, and\r\nreturned our fire; and the day's work was begun, which was carried on\r\nbriskly the greater part of the day on both sides of the Niagara.\r\n\r\n\"About two o'clock, another Provincial dragoon, bespattered, horse and\r\nman, with foam and mud, made his appearance--not wearing his sword or\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\n\"Said an old Green Tiger to me, 'Horse and man jaded, sir; depend upon\r\nit, he brings bad news.' 'Step down and ascertain what intelligence he\r\nbrings.' Away my veteran doubles, and soon returns at a funeral pace.\r\n'Light heart, light step,' were my inward thoughts. I knew by poor old\r\nClibborn's style of return something dreadful had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"'What news, Clibborn? What news, man? Speak out,' said I, as he\r\nadvanced towards the battery, that was still keeping up a brisk fire.\r\nClibborn walked on, perfectly unconscious of the balls that were\r\nploughing up the ground, uttered not a word, but shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"When in the battery, the old man sat down on the platform; still no\r\nword, but the pallor and expression of his countenance indicated the\r\nsorrow of his soul.\r\n\r\n\"I could stand it no longer. I placed my hand on his shoulder, 'For\r\nHeaven's sake, tell us what you know.' In choking accents he revealed\r\nhis melancholy information: 'The general is killed; the enemy has\r\npossession of Queenston Heights.'\r\n\r\n\"Every man in the battery was paralyzed; the battery ceased firing.\r\n\r\n\"A cheer by the enemy from the opposite side of the river recalled us to\r\nour duty. They had heard of their success down the river. Our men, who\r\nhad in various ways evinced their feelings--some in weeping, some in\r\nswearing, some in mournful silence--now exhibit demoniac energy. The\r\nheavy guns are loaded, traversed and fired, as if they were\r\nfield-pieces--too much hurry for precision. 'Take your time, men; don't\r\nthrow away your fire, my lads.' 'No, sir, but we will give it to them\r\nhot and heavy.'\r\n\r\n\"All the guns were worked by the 49 men of my own company, and they\r\nwished to avenge their beloved chief Brock, whom they knew and valued\r\nwith that correct appreciation peculiar to the British soldier. They had\r\nall served under him in Holland and at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n\"I had a very excellent reconnoitring-glass; and as I kept a sharp\r\nlook-out for the effect of our fire, and the movements of the enemy, I\r\nobserved that powder was being removed from a large wooden barrack into\r\nammunition waggons. The only man of the Royal Artillery I had with me\r\nwas a bombardier, Walker. I called his attention to the fact I had\r\nobserved, and directed him to lay a gun for that part of the building\r\nwherein the powder was being taken. At my request he took a look through\r\nmy glass, and, having satisfied himself, he lay the gun as ordered. I,\r\nwith my glass, watched the spot aimed at. I saw one plank of the\r\nbuilding fall out, and at the same instant the whole fabric went up in a\r\npillar of black smoke, with but little noise, as it was no more.\r\nHorses, waggons, men, and building all disappeared; not a vestige of any\r\nwas seen.\r\n\r\n\"Now was our turn to cheer; and we plied the enemy in a style so quick\r\nand accurate, that we silenced all their guns just as a third dragoon\r\ncome galloping up to us, shouting 'Victory! Victory!' Then again we\r\ncheered lustily; but no response from the other side. Night now hid the\r\nenemy from our sight.\r\n\r\n\"The commissariat made its appearance with biscuit, pork, rum, and\r\npotatoes; and we broke our fast for that day about nine p.m.\r\n\r\n\"How strange and unaccountable are the feelings induced by war! Here\r\nwere men of two nations, but of a common origin, speaking the same\r\nlanguage, of the same creed, intent on mutual destruction, rejoicing\r\nwith fiendish pleasure at their address in perpetrating murder by\r\nwholesale, shouting for joy as disasters propagated by the chances of\r\nwar hurled death and agonizing wounds into the ranks of their opponents!\r\nAnd yet the very same men, when chance gave them the opportunity, would\r\nreadily exchange, in their own peculiar way, all the amenities of social\r\nlife, extending to one another a draw of the pipe, and quid, or glass;\r\nobtaining and exchanging information from one and the other of their\r\nrespective services, as to pay, rations, and so on--the victors, with\r\ndelicacy, abstaining from any allusion to the victorious day. Though the\r\nvanquished would allude to their disaster, the victors never named their\r\ntriumphs.\r\n\r\n\"Such is the character of acts and words between British and American\r\nsoldiers which I have witnessed, as officer commanding a guard over\r\nAmerican prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"J. DRISCOLL,\r\n\r\n\"Of the 100th Regiment.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Such was the high esteem in which the character of\r\nGeneral Brock was held even by the enemy, that during the movement of\r\nthe funeral procession of that brave man from Queenston to Fort George,\r\na distance of seven miles, minute guns were fired at every American post\r\non that part of the lines; and even the appearance of hostilities was\r\nsuspended.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Thompson's History of the War of 1812, Chap. xv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHIRD AMERICAN INVASION OF UPPER CANADA, AT AND NEAR FORT ERIE, ON THE\r\nNIAGARA RIVER, UNDER GENERAL SMYTH--HIS ADDRESS TO HIS SOLDIERS--THE\r\nLUDICROUS AND DISGRACEFUL FAILURE OF HIS EXPEDITION--THREE AMERICAN\r\nEXPEDITIONS REPELLED IN 1812 BY THE SPARTAN BANDS OF CANADIAN\r\nVOLUNTEERS, ASSISTED BY A FEW REGIMENTS OF ENGLISH SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of the _second invasion of Canada_--the first\r\ninvasion on the Niagara frontier by the American \"Grand Army of the\r\nCentre.\"\r\n\r\nThe Americans, after recovering in some measure from their disastrous\r\ndefeat at Queenston, commenced gigantic preparations for assembling\r\nanother army near Buffalo, for a second descent on the Niagara frontier,\r\nunder the command of General Smyth, with an army which, according to the\r\nlatest accounts of the American reports themselves, was 8,000 strong,\r\nwith fifteen pieces of field ordnance--sustained in the rear by a\r\npopulous and fertile country, and the facility afforded by good roads to\r\ndraw the supplies for his army and to bring into the field a formidable\r\nartillery. So confident was General Smyth himself of a successful result\r\nof his expedition, that he boasted on the 10th of November \"that in a\r\nfew days the troops under his command would plant the American standard\r\nin Canada,\" and issued an order to the commandant of Fort Niagara to\r\nsave the buildings at Fort George and the adjacent town of Newark\r\n(Niagara), as they would be required for winter quarters for the \"Army\r\nof the Centre.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult if not doubtful task for General Sheaffe and the\r\nregular and militia officers under his command to provide for the\r\ndefence of the country against such formidable odds; for up to the time\r\nat which the American general had violated the terms of the armistice\r\nnot a single British soldier had arrived to reinforce the little\r\nCanadian army; and \"after the conflict at Queenston, the militia, which\r\nconstituted the majority of the British force, had been permitted to\r\nreturn home to secure the remainder of their harvest.\" (Thompson.)\r\n\r\n\"However, on the first alarm being given of the hostile movements of the\r\nAmerican army, those already harassed but loyal Canadian militiamen\r\npromptly returned to their posts, fully determined to dispute every inch\r\nof ground while a man was left to defend it.\"--(_Ib_). Nor were these\r\nvolunteer Loyalists intimidated by General Smyth's extended columns of\r\ncavalry and infantry with which he lined the American shore, his\r\nmarching and countermarching of countless battalions, and all the pomp\r\nof war and parade of martial bombast with which the fertile mind of\r\nGeneral Smyth hoped to terrify the apparently defenceless Canadians; to\r\nwhich he added a flaming proclamation, not excelled in pomposity and\r\nbrag by that of General Hull issued to Canadians three months before. We\r\ngive this proclamation, as we have done that of General Hull, in a\r\nnote.[200]\r\n\r\nThis proclamation, ridiculous as it is, and appealing to the lowest\r\nmercenary as well as better motives of democratic Americans, produced a\r\nconsiderable effect in Pennsylvania, and caused an accession of some\r\n2,000 volunteers to General Smyth's already large forces; but when the\r\ncrisis of action arrived, this grandiloquent General Smyth was not to be\r\nfound on the field of action; and of the twenty boats which were\r\nprovided to convey across the river the first instalment of invaders of\r\nCanada, fourteen boats were sunk or driven back, and only six boats\r\nreached the Canadian shore and gained a temporary hold, but some of them\r\nwere driven back with loss before the next morning, and the remainder\r\nwere taken prisoners. The next day General Smyth promised to do very\r\ngreat things; but we will narrate these doings and the results in the\r\nwords of the American writer Lossing, in his _Field Book of the War of_\r\n1812. Lossing says:\r\n\r\n\"November 27th [1812].--It was sunrise when the troops began to embark,\r\nand so tardy were the movements that it was late in the afternoon when\r\nall was ready. General Smyth did not make his appearance, and all the\r\nmovements were under the direction of his subordinates. A number of\r\nboats had been left to strand upon the shore, and became filled with\r\nwater, snow, and ice; and as hour after hour passed by, dreariness and\r\ndisappointment fell upon the spirits of the shivering troops. Meanwhile\r\nthe enemy had collected on the opposite [British] shore, and were\r\nwatching every movement. At length, when all seemed ready and impatience\r\nhad yielded to hope, an order came from the commanding general '_to\r\ndisembark and dine_.' The wearied and worried troops were deeply\r\nexasperated by this order, and nothing but the most positive assurances\r\nthat the undertaking would be immediately resumed kept them from open\r\nmutiny. The different regiments retired sullenly to their respective\r\nquarters, and General Porter, with his dispirited New York volunteers,\r\nmarched in disgust to Buffalo.\r\n\r\n\"November 28th [1812].--Smyth now called a council of officers. They\r\ncould not agree. The best of them urged the necessity of crossing in\r\nforce at once, before the (Canadian) enemy could make formidable\r\npreparations for their reception. The General decided otherwise; and\r\ndoubt and despondency brooded over the camp that night. The ensuing\r\nSabbath brought no relief. Preparations for another embarkation were\r\nindeed in progress, while the (Canadian) enemy, too, was busy in\r\nopposing labour. It was evident to every spectator of judgment that the\r\ninvasion must be attempted at another point of the river, when, towards\r\nevening, to the astonishment of all, the General issued an order\r\nperfectly characteristic of the man--for the troops to be ready at\r\neight (November 30) o'clock the next morning for embarkation. 'The\r\nGeneral will be on board,' he pompously proclaimed. 'Neither rain, snow,\r\nor frost will prevent the embarkation,' he said. 'The cavalry will soon\r\nscour the fields from Black Rock to the bridge, and suffer no idle\r\nspectators. While embarking, the bands will play martial airs; _Yankee\r\nDoodle_ will be the signal to get under way. * * The landing will be\r\neffected in despite of cannon. The whole army has seen that cannon is to\r\nbe but little dreaded. * * Hearts of war! to-morrow will be memorable in\r\nthe annals of the United States.'\r\n\r\n\"'To-morrow' came, but not the promised achievement. All the officers\r\ndisapproved of the time and manner of the proposed embarkation, and\r\nexpressed their opinions freely. At General Porter's quarters a change\r\nwas agreed upon. Porter deferred the embarkation until Tuesday morning,\r\nthe 1st of December, an hour or two before daylight, and to make the\r\nlanding-place a little below the upper end of Grand Island. Winder\r\nsuggested the propriety of making a descent directly upon Chippewa, 'the\r\nkey of the country.' This Smyth consented to attempt, intending as he\r\nsaid, if successful, to march down to Queenston, and lay siege to Fort\r\nGeorge. Orders were accordingly given for a general rendezvous at the\r\nNavy Yard, at three o'clock on Tuesday morning, and that the troops\r\nshould be collected in the woods near by on Monday, where they should\r\nbuild fires, and await the signal for gathering on the shore of the\r\nriver. The hour arrived, but when day dawned only fifteen hundred were\r\nembarked. Tannehill's Pennsylvania Brigade were not present. Before\r\ntheir arrival rumours had reached the camp that they, too, like Van\r\nRensellaer's militia at Lewiston, had raised a constitutional question\r\nabout being led out of their State. Yet their scruples seem to have been\r\novercome at this time, and they would have invaded Canada cheerfully\r\nunder other auspices. But distrust of their leader, created by the\r\nevents of the last forty-eight hours, had demoralized nearly the whole\r\narmy. They had made so much noise in embarkation that the startled\r\nCanadian had sounded his alarm bugle and discharged signal guns from\r\nFort Erie to Chippewa. Tannehill's Pennsylvanians had not appeared, and\r\nmany other troops lingered upon the shore, loth to embark. In this\r\ndilemma Smyth hastily called a Council of the regular officers, utterly\r\nexcluding those of the volunteers from the conference; and the first\r\nintimation of the result of that Council was an order from the\r\ncommanding general, sent to General Porter, who was on a boat with the\r\npilot, a fourth of a mile from shore, in the van of the impatient\r\nflotilla, _directing the whole army to debark, and repair to their\r\nquarters_. This was accompanied by a declaration that the _invasion of\r\nCanada was abandoned at present_, pleading in bar of just censure, that\r\nhis orders from his superiors were, not to attempt it with less than\r\n3,000 men. The regulars were ordered into winter quarters, and the\r\nvolunteers were dismissed to their homes.\r\n\r\n\"The troops, without order or restraint, discharged their muskets in all\r\ndirections, and a scene of insubordination and utter confusion followed.\r\nAt least a thousand of the volunteers had come from their homes in\r\nresponse to his invitation, and the promise that they should be led into\r\nCanada by a victor [without personal danger, and with the promise of\r\nplunder and glory]. They had implicit confidence in his ability and in\r\nthe sincerity of his great words, and in proportion to their faith and\r\nzeal were now their disappointment and resentment. Unwilling to have\r\ntheir errand to the frontier fruitless of all but disgrace, the\r\nvolunteers earnestly requested permission to be led into Canada under\r\nGeneral Porter, promising the commanding general the speedy capture of\r\nFort Erie if he would furnish them with four pieces of artillery.[201]\r\nBut Smyth evaded their request, and the volunteers were sent home\r\nuttering imprecations against the man whom they considered a mere\r\nblusterer without courage, and a conceited deceiver without honour. They\r\nfelt themselves betrayed, and the inhabitants in the vicinity\r\nsympathized with them. Their indignation was greatly increased by the\r\nill-timed and ungenerous charges made by Smyth in his report to General\r\nDearborn against General Porter, in whom the volunteers had the\r\ngreatest confidence. General Smyth's person was for some time in danger.\r\nHe was compelled to double the guards around his tent, and to move it\r\nfrom place to place to avoid continual insults. He was several times\r\nfired at when he ventured out of his marquee. Porter openly attributed\r\nthe abandonment of the invasion of Canada to the cowardice of Smyth.\" * *\r\n\r\n\"Thus ended the melodrama of Smyth's invasion of Canada. The whole\r\naffair was disgraceful and humiliating. 'What wretched work Smyth and\r\nPorter have made of it!' wrote General Wadsworth to General Van\r\nRensellaer from his home at Genesee at the close of the year. 'I wish\r\nthose who are disposed to find so much fault could know the state of the\r\nmilitia since the day you gave up the command. It has been \"confusion\r\nworse confounded.\"' The day that saw Smyth's failure was indeed\r\n'memorable in the annals of the United States,' as well as in his own\r\nprivate history. Confidence in his military ability was destroyed; and\r\nthree months afterwards he was 'disbanded,' as the _Army Register_ says;\r\nin other words, he was deposed without a trial, and excluded from the\r\narmy.\"[202]\r\n\r\nSuch was the third and last American invasion of Upper Canada in 1812.\r\nThree large American armies defeated--two of them taken prisoners by\r\nless than one-third their number of Canadian volunteers, aided by a few\r\nhundred regular soldiers and as many Indians, who, notwithstanding the\r\nabuse of them by the American generals, never murdered a woman or child\r\nduring the year, or killed a prisoner, and who were no more \"savages\"\r\nthan the men who maligned them.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan bands of Canadian Loyalist volunteers, aided by a few\r\nhundred English soldiers and civilized Indians, repelled the Persian\r\nthousands of democratic American invaders, and maintained the virgin\r\nsoil of Canada unpolluted by the foot of the plundering invader.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: The following is General Smyth's proclamation, issued to\r\nhis soldiers, on his intended invasion of Canada:\r\n\r\n\"_General Smyth to the Soldiers of the Army of the Centre._\r\n\r\n\"Companions in arms!--The time is come when you will cross the stream\r\nof Niagara to conquer Canada, and to secure the peace of the Canadian\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n\"You will enter a country that is to be one of the United States. You\r\nare to arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens. It\r\nis not against _them_ that we come to make war. It is against that\r\nGovernment which holds them as vassals.\r\n\r\n\"You will make this war as little as possible distressful to the\r\nCanadian population. If they are peaceable, they are to be secure in\r\ntheir persons; and in their property as far as our imperious necessities\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\n\"Provided that, plundering is absolutely forbidden. Any soldier who\r\nquits his rank to plunder on the field of battle, will be punished in\r\nthe most exemplary manner.\r\n\r\n\"But your just rights as soldiers will be maintained; whatever is booty\r\nby the usages of war, you shall have. All horses belonging to the\r\nartillery and cavalry; all waggons and teams in the public service, will\r\nbe sold for the benefit of the captors. Public stores will be secured\r\nfor the service of the United States. The Government will, with justice,\r\npay you the value.\r\n\r\n\"The horses drawing the light artillery of the enemy are wanted for the\r\nservice of the United States. I will order $200 for each to be paid to\r\nthe party who may take them. I will also order $40 to be paid for the\r\narms and spoils of each savage warrior who shall be killed.\r\n\r\n\"_Soldiers!_--You are amply provided for war. You are superior in number\r\nto the enemy. Your personal strength and activity are greater. Your\r\nweapons are longer. The regular soldiers of the enemy are really old,\r\nwhose best years have been spent in the sickly climate of the West\r\nIndies. They will not be able to stand before you--you who charge with\r\nthe bayonet. You have seen Indians, such as those hired by the English\r\nto murder women and children, and kill and scalp the wounded. You have\r\nseen their dances and grimaces, and heard their yells. Can you fear\r\n_them_? No; you hold them in the utmost contempt.\r\n\r\n\"_Volunteers!_--Disloyal and traitorous men have endeavoured to dissuade\r\nyou from your duty.

At other times they say that if you are\r\nwounded, the Government will not provide for you by pensions.

He immediately despatched two companies of the Voltigeurs,\r\nunder the command of Captain Perrault, of the same regiment, with 300\r\nIndians under Captain Duchesne, of the Indian Department, to reinforce\r\nMajor Laforce, of the 1st Battalion embodied militia, who was posted\r\nwith the two flank companies of that battalion at the River La Cole.\r\nThis detachment, after a fatiguing march of thirty-six miles, chiefly\r\nthrough _morasses_ and _abatis_, arrived early in the afternoon of the\r\nsame day at Burtonville, and took a position within the River La Cole, a\r\nmile distant from it, in conjunction with a party of thirty Algonquin\r\nand Abenaki Indians, and a few Voyageurs under Captain McKay, a\r\ngentleman of the North-West Company in the Voyageurs' corps. Major De\r\nSalaberry arrived the day following, with the remainder of the\r\nVoltigeurs and the Voyageurs, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMcGillivray, and four companies of the volunteer Chasseurs from the\r\nparishes of Chateauguay, St. Constant, St. Philip, and l'Acadie.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime the enemy occupied Champlain Town, two or three miles\r\nfrom the lines, and an earnest invasion was momentarily expected.\r\nNothing occurred of any consequence until the 20th, in the morning, when\r\nCaptain McKay, visiting the picquet between three and four o'clock,\r\nperceived the enemy fording the River La Cole, and at the same instant\r\nheard them cock their firelocks in the surrounding bushes. He had\r\nscarcely time to apprise the picquet under Captain Bernard Panet, of\r\ntheir danger, when the enemy, who had surrounded the guardhut on all\r\nsides, discharged a volley of musketry so close that their wads set fire\r\nto the roof and consumed the hut. The militia and Indians discharged\r\ntheir pieces, and dashing through the ranks of the enemy, escaped\r\nunhurt, while the Americans, who had forded the river in two places,\r\nmistaking each other for the enemy in the darkness and confusion of the\r\nnight, kept up a brisk fire for near half an hour, in which they killed\r\nand wounded several of their own people. After discovering their error\r\nthey retired back to Champlain Town, leaving five of their men wounded,\r\nand three or four killed, who were found by the Indians on the same day.\r\nThe American party is said to have consisted of fourteen hundred (1,400)\r\nmen and a troop of dragoons, and was commanded by Colonels Pike and\r\nClarke.\r\n\r\n\"This movement of the enemy gave room to expect another more vigorous\r\nattempt to invade Lower Canada; and on the 22nd, the Governor, by a\r\nGeneral Order, directed the whole of the militia of the province to\r\nconsider themselves commanded for active service, and to be prepared to\r\nmove forward to meet the enemy as soon as required.\r\n\r\n\"Lieut.-Colonel Deschambault was ordered to cross the St. Lawrence at\r\nLachine to Cahuaugo, with the Point Claire, Riviere du Chene, Vaudreuil,\r\nand Longue Point Battalions, and to march upon l'Acadie. The volunteers\r\nof the 1st Battalion of Montreal Militia, the flank companies of the 2nd\r\nand 3rd Battalions, and a troop of Militia Dragoons, crossed the river\r\nto Longueuil and Laprairie; and the whole mass of population in the\r\ndistrict of Montreal made a spontaneous movement towards the point of\r\ninvasion with an enthusiasm unsurpassed in any age or country.\r\n\r\n\"General Dearborn, who, no doubt, was well informed of the state of the\r\npublic mind in Lower Canada at this crisis, foresaw, from the multitude\r\nassembled to oppose his progress, and the hostile spirit of the\r\nCanadians, the fruitlessness of an attempt to invade Lower Canada, and\r\nbegan to withdraw his sickly and already enfeebled host into winter\r\nquarters at Plattsburg and Burlington.\r\n\r\n\"All apprehensions of an invasion of Lower Canada for the present season\r\nhaving disappeared, the troops and embodied militia were, on the 27th of\r\nNovember, ordered into winter quarters.\"[203]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: Christie's History of the War of 1812, Chap, iv., pp.\r\n90-92.\r\n\r\n\"The armistice between General Smyth and Sheaffe after the battle of\r\nQueenston was terminated on the 20th of November, pursuant to\r\nnotification to that effect from the former.

Sir George Prevost, Governor-General,\r\nwas placed at great disadvantage for their general defence, as the small\r\nBritish force then occupying the Canadas, and the wide extent of\r\nfrontier the British commander-in-chief had to defend, rendered it\r\nimpossible for him to cope with the American enemy in point of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe American army, to whom was committed this year _the honour of\r\nconquering Canada_, was divided, as the year before, into three\r\ndivisions: first, the Army of the North, consisting of 18,000 men,\r\ncommanded by General Hampton, and stationed along the southern shore of\r\nLake Champlain, on the south precincts of Lower Canada; the second, the\r\nArmy of the Centre, consisting of 7,000 effective men, which was again\r\nsubdivided into two divisions, commanded by Generals Dearborn and\r\nWilkinson, and were posted from Buffalo, at the lower extremity of Lake\r\nErie, to Sackett's Harbour, at the lower end of Lake Ontario; and the\r\nthird, the Army of the West, consisting of \"8,000 effective men,\"\r\naccording to the American account, commanded by Generals Harrison and\r\nWilkinson, whose limits extended from Buffalo westward, as far as the\r\nBritish frontier extended.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Detroit by General Brock and his little army,\r\nColonel Proctor was appointed to command that fort, with a force of\r\nabout 600 regulars and a number of Indians--an entirely insufficient\r\nforce, but all that could be spared and provided from the slender forces\r\nof Upper Canada. The American General, Harrison, who succeeded Hull in\r\nthe command of the West, organized a large force by the end of 1812, of\r\nover 5,000 men, consisting principally of men from Ohio and Kentucky.\r\nAmong the small outposts which Proctor had established in the\r\nneighbourhood of Detroit, was one at _Frenchtown_, on the River Raisin,\r\ntwenty-six miles from Detroit, which consisted of thirty of the Essex\r\nMilitia, under Major Reynolds, and about 200 Indians. On the 17th of\r\nJanuary, 1813, Brigadier-General Winchester, commanding a division of\r\nthe American army, sent Colonel Lewis with a strong force to dislodge\r\nthe British--which he succeeded in doing, after a sharp encounter in\r\nwhich the Americans lost twelve killed and fifty wounded. Reynolds\r\nretreated to Brownstown, sixteen miles in his rear, and gave information\r\nto Colonel Proctor of the advance of Winchester's brigade, which now\r\noccupied _Frenchtown_, and _was over one thousand strong_.\r\n\r\nColonel Proctor knew that his only hope of success was by prompt action\r\nto fight the enemy in detail, before General Harrison could unite his\r\nwhole force to bear on Detroit. He therefore forthwith assembled all his\r\navailable force at Brownstown, and on the 21st pushed on to attack the\r\nAmerican camp at Frenchtown, with about 500 regular soldiers and militia\r\nand 600 Indians. The attack upon the American camp was made on the\r\nmorning of the 22nd; and the Indians, under the Wyandot chief Roundhead,\r\nspeedily turned the enemy's flank and caused him to retreat--Chief\r\nRoundhead with his Indians taking General Winchester himself prisoner,\r\nand delivering him unharmed to Colonel Proctor. About 500 of General\r\nWinchester's men had thrown themselves into the houses, where they were\r\nmaking deadly resistance from fear of falling into the hands of the\r\nIndians, who were greatly exasperated by this mode of warfare, and\r\nassailed and pursued their retreating but resisting enemies with a\r\nferocity unequalled during the whole three years' war. Colonel Proctor\r\ninformed General Winchester that the houses would be set on fire, and he\r\nwould be utterly unable to restrain the Indians, if this kind of warfare\r\nwere persisted in, and they refused to surrender. They at length\r\nsurrendered, on being assured that they would be protected from the\r\nIndians. Thirty-two officers and upwards of 500 men were taken\r\nprisoners, not one of whom sustained any injury from their captors,\r\nwhether regular soldiers, militia, or Indians.\r\n\r\nBut many Americans were slaughtered in refusing to surrender for fear of\r\nthe Indians, and determined to fight and retreat in hopes of making\r\ntheir escape. They suffered severely; and on that account several\r\nAmerican writers have represented the Indians at the battle of\r\nFrenchtown as committing unheard-of cruelties upon helpless men, women,\r\nand children. Even President Madison joined in the misrepresentation, as\r\nhe was always ready to seize upon any pretext to assail the British\r\nGovernment for admitting the alliance of the Indians in the\r\nwar--forgetful that his Government had repeatedly sought to do the same\r\nthing, but had only succeeded in a few instances. But in vindication of\r\nthe Indians and their commander, Colonel Proctor, the following facts\r\nmay be stated, which are conclusive on the subject. In the first place,\r\nGeneral Winchester, the commander of the American detachment, was taken\r\nprisoner by the Indians, and instead of being butchered and scalped, was\r\ndelivered unharmed by the Wyandot chief Roundhead into the hands of\r\nColonel Proctor.\r\n\r\nHowever, many of the Americans refused to surrender from fear of falling\r\ninto the hands of the Indians, and attempted to retreat and fight, in\r\nhopes of escape, but were mostly killed in the attempt by the Indians,\r\nso greatly exasperated by the mode of warfare adopted against them from\r\nthe houses. Under this pretext most American writers have represented\r\nthe Indians, with the sanction of the English, as having committed\r\nunheard-of cruelties against helpless men, women, and children at the\r\nbattle of Frenchtown--statements which were pure fiction, as has been\r\nproved to demonstration in Chapter XXXV. of this history, in the\r\nfictions of the alleged \"Massacre of Wyoming.\"\r\n\r\nFor example, General Harrison, who was one of the few old American\r\ngenerals employed by the democratic President Madison in the war, and\r\nwho was one or two days' march from Frenchtown, was informed and wrote\r\nin a despatch two days after the battle (24th of January), that \"General\r\nWinchester had been taken by the Indians, _killed and scalped; his body\r\nwas cut up and mangled in a shocking manner, and one of his hands cut\r\noff_;\" when not a hair of General Winchester's head was injured, and he\r\nwas afterwards exchanged, and appeared on the Niagara frontier, and was\r\nagain taken prisoner, safe and sound, by the British at the battle of\r\nStony Creek.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, in his despatches written five days afterwards, after\r\nhaving ascertained all the facts of the battle, makes no mention of any\r\ncruelties practised by the Indians, which he doubtless would have done\r\nhad there been any truth in the imputations against the Indians or the\r\nEnglish soldiers with whom they acted. He speaks of General Winchester\r\nas among the prisoners, notwithstanding his statement five days before\r\nthat he had been killed, scalped, and cut to pieces. The following\r\nfacts, given by Mr. Thompson in his \"History of the War of 1812,\" are\r\nconclusive on this affair of the battle of Frenchtown, the 22nd of\r\nJanuary, 1813:\r\n\r\n\"Much has been said by American writers regarding the conduct of the\r\ncombined forces of the affair of Frenchtown. They have not even stopped\r\nto charge British officers and soldiers with the most enormous\r\ncruelties, committed in conjunction with the Indians, when it was in\r\ntheir power to have prevented them. Such have been the contemptible\r\nmisrepresentations to which many publications, otherwise deserving of\r\nmerit, have descended, as well of this as of many other affairs during\r\nthe war; and even amongst a few British subjects they have gained\r\ncredence.\r\n\r\n\"General Harrison, however, in writing his despatches to Governor Meigs,\r\nas well as several officers of his army who avail themselves of the\r\ngeneral express to write to their friends in Chillicothe, in most of\r\ntheir letters give the details of the battle, _but seem to be ignorant\r\nas regards the greatest part of that 'Massacre_,' as it has been\r\ngravely termed. It is gathered from these despatches and letters by a\r\nChillicothe journal of the 2nd of February, 1813, that '_those who\r\nsurrendered themselves on the field of battle were taken prisoners by\r\nthe British, while those who attempted to escape were pursued,\r\ntomahawked, and scalped_.' Now, even this account, in part, is\r\nincorrect; for the Indians, by whom they were assailed, were posted\r\nthere for the express purpose of cutting off their retreat; and _those\r\nwho surrendered to the Indians were safely conducted to the British\r\ncamp_; but such was the panic with which these unfortunate fugitives\r\nwere seized, that no persuasions on the part of the Indian chiefs, _who\r\nwere fully disposed to comply with the orders of Colonel Proctor_, could\r\nprevail on them to surrender until they were either wounded and taken,\r\nor overtaken in the chase by their pursuers, when no efforts of the\r\nchiefs could save them from their fury.\r\n\r\n\"In a letter containing copies of despatches from General Harrison,\r\ndated 24th January, 1813, it is stated that 'when the attack commenced,\r\nGeneral Winchester ordered a retreat, but from the utter confusion which\r\nprevailed, this could not be effected; and he then told them that every\r\nman must take care of himself, and attempted to make his own escape on\r\nhorseback, but was overtaken by the Indians before he had gone a mile,\r\nand killed and scalped. His body was cut up and mangled in a most\r\nshocking manner, and one of his hands cut off.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, here is an awful Indian tale, manufactured, as many others have\r\nbeen of like description, which turns out to be a mere fabrication; for\r\nwhen General Winchester found himself pursued in his attempt to escape,\r\nhe with a few others surrendered themselves to a chief of the Wyandot\r\nnation, and not a hair of their heads was hurt, _except the injury\r\nreceived from the fight_.\r\n\r\n\"It is also stated in the same letter that Colonels Allen and Lewis were\r\namong the slain; in contradiction of which, in General Harrison's letter\r\nto Governor Meigs, dated 29th January, it is stated that General\r\nWinchester and Colonel and Brigade-Major Gerrard are among the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\"The conclusion is plain, that had those deluded people not been\r\novercome by fear, and surrendered themselves at once, they might have\r\nenjoyed the same safety as did General Winchester and his\r\ncompanions.\"[204]\r\n\r\n\"This spirited and vigorous measure (on the part of Colonel Proctor)\r\ncompletely disconcerted the arrangements made by General Harrison for\r\nthe recovery of Michigan territory, and secured Detroit from any\r\nimmediate danger. The House of Assembly of Lower Canada [as also of\r\nUpper Canada] passed a vote of thanks to Colonel Proctor for the skill\r\nand intrepidity with which he planned and carried into effect this\r\nenterprise. A vote of thanks was also passed to the officers,\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and privates who assisted in its\r\naccomplishment; and Colonel Proctor was immediately promoted to the rank\r\nof brigadier-general by Sir George Prevost, the commander of the forces,\r\nuntil the pleasure of the Prince Regent should be known, who was pleased\r\nto approve and confirm the appointment.\"[205]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nAMERICANS ATTACK AND PLUNDER IN AND ABOUT BROCKVILLE--SUCCESSFUL\r\nRETALIATORY ATTACK ON OGDENSBURG.\r\n\r\nThe next military affairs in the order of time, illustrative of the\r\nloyalty and courage of the Canadians, occurred on the River St.\r\nLawrence, in the neighbourhoods of Prescott and Brockville. Most of the\r\nAmerican invasions were mere raids for destruction and plunder of\r\nproperty. In the winter of 1813 several of these raids were made from\r\nOgdensburg on the British settlements. \"After winter (1813) had fairly\r\nset in, and the St. Lawrence was frozen over, the Americans on several\r\noccasions sent marauding parties across the ice to pillage and destroy\r\nthe Canadian settlements. [The American mode of giving liberty to\r\nCanada.] On the night of the 6th of February, two companies of riflemen\r\nfrom Ogdensburg, under command of Captain Forsyth, made a descent on the\r\ntown of Brockville, wounded a sentry, fired several houses, and carried\r\noff a quantity of plunder, together with fifty of the inhabitants.\r\nSeveral inroads from Ogdensburg were made; and the British were anxious\r\nto retaliate.\" (Tuttle.) On the closing of the session of the\r\nLegislature of Lower Canada, the 17th of February, 1813, the\r\nGovernor-General, Sir George Prevost, made a tour of inspection of the\r\nforts of Upper Canada. On his arrival at Prescott he was importuned to\r\nauthorize an attack upon Ogdensburg, in retaliation for an attack upon\r\nBrockville by the enemy some days previous. He consented to a\r\ndemonstration on the river to ascertain the enemy's force; and on the\r\nensuing morning (22nd February), as the Governor-General departed,\r\naccompanied to Kingston by Lieut.-Colonel Pearson (commander of\r\nPrescott), Lieut.-Colonel M'Donnell, second in command, moved with his\r\nparty across the river on the ice, towards Ogdensburg. The enemy,\r\nperceiving the movement, were prepared to receive him; and\r\nLieut.-Colonel M'Donnell, impelled by that spirit characteristic of\r\nBritish soldiers, turned the demonstration into a real attack.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was driven from the town after a short contest, leaving about\r\ntwenty killed and a considerable number wounded. Four brass\r\nfield-pieces, seven pieces of iron ordnance, complete, with several\r\nstand of arms and a considerable quantity of stores, fell into the hands\r\nof the victors, who lost seven killed, and seven officers (including\r\nLieutenant-Colonel M'Donnell) and forty-one men wounded. After having\r\ndestroyed two small schooners and two gun-boats left there to winter,\r\nthey removed the stores and arms to their own side of the river at\r\nPrescott. This brilliant achievement prevented any further American\r\nforays on the Canadians from Cornwall to Gananoque for the rest of the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nWINTER PREPARATIONS IN LOWER CANADA FOR THE CAMPAIGN--UNPRECEDENTED\r\nMARCH ON SNOW-SHOES OF LOYALIST VOLUNTEERS FROM NEW BRUNSWICK TO LOWER\r\nCANADA--AMERICAN PLAN OF OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe greatest exertions were made in Canada during the winter to prepare\r\nfor the ensuing campaign. The Canadian regiment of Fencibles, the\r\nVoltigeurs, the Glengarries, were recruited with diligence and success,\r\nthough still without reinforcements from England--too much engrossed\r\nwith her European wars to afford much assistance to the colonies. A\r\nvolunteer regiment from New Brunswick came, by permission and authority,\r\nto the assistance of the beleaguered but hitherto successful Canadians.\r\n\"The King's Regiment of New Brunswick was mustered into the regular army\r\nas the 104th Regiment, and sent to Canada for active service. The\r\nregiment was first formed amongst the Loyalists who had settled in York\r\ncounty, about Fredericton, in 1784, and on its voluntary enrolment in\r\nthe regular army, the Legislature passed complimentary resolutions to\r\nofficers and men, and presented the regiment with a handsome silver\r\ntrumpet. A portion of this regiment was conveyed to Quebec by sea; but\r\nseveral companies made a very trying march on snow-shoes, through an\r\nunbroken country, during very cold weather, to arrive in Canada in time\r\nfor the spring campaign.\"[206]\r\n\r\n\"The plan of the American campaign for 1813 was that a large army under\r\nGeneral Dearborn was to threaten Lower Canada, whilst a determined\r\neffort was to be made to retake Michigan territory, capture the forts of\r\nNiagara frontier, and thus reduce the whole of Upper Canada. This\r\naccomplished, all the armies were to make a joint descent upon Montreal\r\nand Quebec, which would be followed by the occupation of the Maritime\r\nProvinces, and thus the British would be driven from the American\r\ncontinent.\"[207]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FLEET ON LAKE ONTARIO SUPERIOR TO THE BRITISH FLEET, AND, WITH\r\nTHE ARMY, ATTACKS AND TAKES YORK (TORONTO), AND AFTER OCCUPYING IT LESS\r\nTHAN TWO WEEKS, RETIRE WITH MUCH HASTE.\r\n\r\nThe American fleet on Lake Ontario was superior to that of the British,\r\nand was being daily augmented at Sackett's Harbour--their principal navy\r\nyard on Lake Ontario. The first descent was expected to be upon\r\nKingston; but the American Government deemed it too hazardous a game to\r\nrisk their Lake armament upon an enterprise against this principal\r\nmilitary depot of the British in Upper Canada, and resolved to direct\r\ntheir forces against more distant and defenceless places on the lake.\r\n\r\nCommodore Chauncey having equipped his fleet for an expedition, and\r\nreceived on board upwards of 1,700 troops under the command of Generals\r\nDearborn and Pike, sailed from Sackett's Harbour as early as the 25th of\r\nApril, and on the following evening arrived off York (Toronto) with\r\nfourteen sail of armed vessels; and on the following day commenced\r\nlanding their troops about three miles west of the town--the British\r\nbeing compelled to retire after making a strong resistance. The\r\ngrenadiers of the 8th Regiment, who lost their captain, M'Neal, were,\r\nafter a desperate contest, almost annihilated by the overwhelming\r\nnumbers of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe best account we have read of this expedition against, or rather raid\r\nupon, the town of York, is given by Thompson, and which I quote at\r\nlength, relating as it does to what was then and now is the capital--the\r\ndefenceless capital--of Upper Canada:\r\n\r\n\"In the month of April, the ice having completely broken up in the port\r\nof Sackett's Harbour, where the American squadron under Commodore\r\nChauncey had wintered, General Dearborn, commanding the right division\r\nof the Army of the Centre, consisting of 4,000 men stationed in that\r\nvicinity, selected 2,000 of the most efficient of his division [American\r\nHistory of the War, published in New York], and on the 22nd of the month\r\nembarked them on board the fleet, with which he ascended the lake, and\r\nwith this force appeared off the harbour of York, the capital of Upper\r\nCanada, on the morning of the 27th.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy appearing to threaten an attack upon the town, General\r\nSheaffe collected his forces, which consisted of nearly 700 men,\r\nincluding regulars and militia, with about 100 Indians; and with these\r\nhe made a most determined resistance to the landing of the enemy; but at\r\nlength, overcome by numbers, he was compelled to retire; by which means\r\nthe enemy was enabled to effect his landing a short distance above the\r\nfort, which was situated about two miles to the west of the town, at the\r\nentrance of the harbour.\r\n\r\n\"So soon as the American troops, who were led on by General Pike, had\r\nmade good their landing, they formed into two lines (the first of which\r\nwas commanded personally by General Pike, and the rear or reserve line\r\nby General Pearce), and in this order advanced upon the first battery\r\nand carried it by assault; they then advanced towards the citadel in the\r\nsame order, and by the same means captured an intervening battery.\r\n\r\n\"Here the columns halted, in order to dress the lines for an attack upon\r\nthe main works. At this moment a large magazine accidentally exploded,\r\nby which a quantity of stones and timbers were thrown into the air, and\r\nin their fall killed and wounded a number on both sides, amongst whom\r\nwas the American general, Pike.\r\n\r\n\"The British regulars and militia performed prodigies of valour, but\r\nwere overpowered by a force three times their number, and in a high\r\nstate of discipline;[208] they were compelled to retreat towards the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\"General Sheaffe then held a Council with his principal officers and\r\ncivil authorities of the town, by whom it was advised that he should\r\nretreat towards Kingston with the remainder of his troops; and that the\r\ncommandant of the militia, Lieutenant-Colonel Chewett, should treat\r\nwith the American commander for terms for the surrender of York.\r\n\r\n\"At the capture of York the British lost not less than 400 men, 300 of\r\nwhom were made prisoners of war, and about forty killed and wounded by\r\nthe explosion. The Americans lost 378, thirty-eight of whom were killed\r\nand two hundred and twenty-two wounded by the explosion of the magazine.\r\nGeneral Pike died of his contusions a few minutes after being carried on\r\nboard of one of the vessels.[209]\r\n\r\n\"On the 8th of May, the American army under General Dearborn once more\r\nevacuated York, after having occupied it twelve days, and secured much\r\nbooty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FLEET AND ARMY RETURN TO SACKETT's HARBOUR--MAKE PREPARATIONS\r\nFOR ATTACKING FORT GEORGE AND THE TOWN OF NEWARK, WHICH, AFTER A SEVERE\r\nBATTLE, THEY TAKE AND OCCUPY.\r\n\r\nAfter evacuating York, the American fleet and army proceeded again to\r\nSackett's Harbour, where preparations were immediately made for invading\r\nthe Niagara frontier. On the 20th of May the American fleet again\r\nascended Lake Ontario, and on the morning of the 23rd they appeared off\r\nthe mouth of the Niagara river, soon after which, the weather being\r\nfavourable to their purpose, they attacked Fort George and the town of\r\nNewark (now Niagara), by land and water. Early in the morning of the\r\n27th of May the enemy commenced a combined attack upon the fort, having\r\npreviously, on the 24th and 25th, materially injured the works by a\r\nwarm cannonade from their ships and batteries. A body of about 800\r\nriflemen, under Colonel Winfield Scott, landed near the Two Mile Creek,\r\nwhile the fleet ranged up in the form of a crescent, extending from the\r\nnorth of the Lighthouse to the Two Mile Creek, so as to enfilade the\r\nBritish batteries by a cross fire. The riflemen, after forming and\r\nascending the bank, were met by the British, and compelled to give way\r\nin disorder, and return to the beach, from whence they kept up a smart\r\nfire under cover of the bank. In the meantime, another body of upwards\r\nof 2,000 men, under the command of General Lewis, made a landing, and\r\nformed on the beach under cover of a tremendous cannonade of round shot,\r\nand showers of grape and canister from the fleet, that swept the\r\nadjacent plain, and compelled the British to retire. General Vincent,\r\nfinding the works torn to pieces by the enemy's artillery, and no longer\r\ntenable against so overwhelming a force, caused the fort to be\r\ndismantled, and the magazines to be blown up, and retreated to\r\nQueenston, leaving the Americans to take possession of the ruins of the\r\nfort. The British loss consisted of fifty-two killed and upwards of\r\nthree hundred wounded and missing [more than half the entire force]. The\r\nAmericans state their loss at thirty-nine killed and a hundred and\r\neleven wounded.[210]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH RETREAT TO BURLINGTON HEIGHTS--BATTLE OF STONY CREEK--DEFEAT\r\nOF THE AMERICANS, AND THEIR DISORDERLY RETREAT TO FORT GEORGE.\r\n\r\n\"General Vincent, on the ensuing day, having collected all the forces\r\nfrom Chippewa and Fort Erie, and destroyed or rendered useless the posts\r\nand stores along the frontier, commenced his retreat towards Burlington\r\nHeights, at the head of Lake Ontario.\" (Christie.)\r\n\r\n\"General Vincent continued his retreat as far as Burlington Heights; and\r\non the 1st day of June was followed by an American army of 3,500\r\ninfantry, and about 300 cavalry, commanded by Generals Chandler and\r\nWinder, for the purpose, as was vainly boasted, of making prisoners of\r\nthe whole British army, and thus terminate the contest of the\r\nnorth-western frontier.\"\r\n\r\nThis expected conquest of the whole British army was commenced by the\r\naffair of Stony Creek, when both of the American generals themselves\r\nwere taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 5th of June, the American forces encamped at the\r\nvillage of Stony Creek, about nine miles from the British camp at\r\nBurlington Heights, with the purpose of attacking and taking the British\r\nposition next day. But General Vincent was on the alert to obtain\r\ninformation as to the enemy's strength and movements, and dispatched\r\nColonel (afterwards Major-General) Harvey, with two companies, to\r\nreconnoitre their camp at Stony Creek, and, from the report received,\r\ndetermined to attack them that very night.\r\n\r\n\"All the troops, both regulars and militia, that could possibly be\r\nspared from the garrison at Burlington Heights, together with those who\r\nhad retreated from Fort George, amounting in all to 700, were ordered to\r\nbe in readiness for a movement. Immediately after dark they commenced an\r\nadvance towards Stony Creek, where, after several halts in order to\r\nreconnoitre the country through which they were marching, they arrived\r\nbetween one and two o'clock on the morning of the 6th of June.\r\nImmediately the quarter guard of the enemy was surprised and taken, and\r\nthe assailants rushed into the camp, where all was in apparent security.\r\nBut such a scene of carnage commenced--the huzzas of the besiegers; the\r\nyells of the Indians, led on by Captain Brant; the clashing of bayonets,\r\nand, above all, the thunder of the cannon and musketry, rendered it\r\ntruly appalling. A column of the enemy was at length formed into some\r\nkind of order, but to no purpose; they were by this time completely\r\nunnerved and dispirited, which, together with the darkness of the night\r\nand the clouds of smoke, threw them into the greatest confusion and\r\ndisorder. Not so, however, with the British troops; their plans had been\r\nso well concerted, that every man knew his rallying signal; they were,\r\ntherefore, at all times beyond surprise. The American army, being\r\ncompletely discomfited, retreated from their bivouac in the greatest\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as General Vincent had completed the defeat of the enemy, he\r\nagain fell back upon Burlington Heights, taking as trophies of his\r\nvictory three field-pieces and a brass field howitzer, captured from the\r\nenemy, besides both their generals, and about 150 officers, sergeants,\r\nand rank and file.\r\n\r\n\"After the defeat at Stony Creek, the American army, in the most\r\nindescribable manner [helter-skelter, every man for himself] retreated\r\ntowards Fort George [whence they came] without the least military order\r\nor subordination; in fact, such officers as could avail themselves of\r\nhorses on the road, regardless of the means employed for that purpose,\r\ntook them and made their way to the lines with all possible speed, and\r\nleft the rest of the army to shift for themselves; they, therefore,\r\nretreated [or scampered] in small detached parties, some of whom had\r\nexonerated themselves of their arms and equipments. Thus did they travel\r\n[at double-quick] towards their headquarters from two or three to a\r\ndozen; and were, in compassion for their sufferings, succoured by those\r\nvery people whose houses, a day or two previous, they had ransacked and\r\nplundered.\"[211]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII.\r\n\r\nGENERAL VINCENT, REINFORCED, PURSUES THE RETREATING ENEMY--BRILLIANT\r\nAFFAIR OF THE BEAVER DAMS, IN WHICH SEVERAL HUNDRED AMERICANS SURRENDER\r\nTO ONE-FIFTH THEIR NUMBER--THE AMERICANS COOPED UP IN FORT GEORGE--FORT\r\nSCHLOSSER AND BLACK ROCK ATTACKED BY THE BRITISH, AND THE PUBLIC FORTS\r\nAND MAGAZINES DESTROYED OR TAKEN--THE AMERICAN ARMY CANNOT BE INDUCED TO\r\nCOME OUT OF FORT GEORGE INTO OPEN FIELD FIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn a short time General Vincent received some reinforcements, and\r\nassumed the offensive, advanced towards Fort George with a view to\r\ninvesting it--forming his line on the Four Mile Creek, with his left\r\nresting on the lake; but he ultimately extended his line from the Twelve\r\nMile Creek (St. Catharines) to Queenston.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lewis, who now had full command (General Dearborn having\r\nresigned), finding his advance posts and foraging parties continually\r\nharassed and frequently made prisoners by small detachments of British\r\nand Canadian troops stationed at different posts through the country, in\r\norder to prevent the American camp at Fort George from obtaining\r\nsupplies, dispatched Colonel Boerstler with about 600 or 700 men, by way\r\nof Queenston, with a view of dislodging a detachment or picquet posted\r\nat a place called the Beaver Dams, a few miles from Queenston. Colonel\r\nBoerstler was surprised by a small party of Indians under Captain Ker;\r\nand believing themselves hemmed in by superior numbers, surrendered to\r\nLieutenant (afterwards Colonel) Fitzgibbon, of the 49th Regiment, who\r\narrived in time to complete the victory with a detachment of forty-six\r\nrank and file. The prisoners were five to one to the captors, being 512\r\nin number, including twenty-five officers, two field pieces, and a stand\r\nof colours.\r\n\r\nBy these successes, the Americans were compelled to confine themselves\r\nto Fort George and its neighbourhood; and before the 1st of July the\r\nBritish had formed a line extending from Twelve Mile Creek, on Lake\r\nOntario (Port Dalhousie), across to Queenston, on the Niagara river; and\r\nthe Canadians began now to retaliate the game of marauding which the\r\nAmericans had been practising on the Niagara frontier. From Chippewa an\r\nattack was made on Fort Schlosser, on the American side of the river,\r\nduring the night of the 4th of July, by a small party of militia and\r\nsoldiers under Lieutenant-Colonel Clarke, who surprised the guard at\r\nthat post, and brought away a brass six-pounder, upwards of fifty stand\r\nof arms, a small quantity of stores, with a gun-boat and two batteaux.\r\nAt daybreak in the morning of the 11th of July, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBishop, lately commanding Fort Erie, crossed over the river with 240\r\nmen, consisting of a small party of militia and detachments of the 41st\r\nand 49th Regiments, and effectually surprised the enemy's post at Black\r\nRock, burning his block-houses, stores, barracks, dockyard, and a\r\nvessel, but were compelled to hasten their departure by a reinforcement\r\nof American militia and some Indians in their interest, who opened a\r\nsmart fire under cover of the surrounding woods, killing thirteen of the\r\nBritish attacking party, and wounding a considerable number--among\r\nothers, Lieutenant-Colonel Bishop, mortally; but the British party\r\nbrought away seven pieces of ordnance, two hundred stand of small arms,\r\nand a great quantity of stores.\r\n\r\nThe two armies were almost in sight of each other at Fort George; the\r\ncommander of the British wished to ascertain the extent of the enemy's\r\nworks and his means of defence, and to draw him into an open field of\r\nbattle, and therefore, on the 24th of August, made a demonstration as if\r\nto assault the fort, drove in the picquets; took several of them,\r\nadvanced to within a few hundred yards of the enemy, who, though\r\nsupported by the fire upon the British from their batteries on the\r\nAmerican side of the river, could not be induced to leave their\r\nentrenchments and venture in the open field, although the force of the\r\nBritish did not exceed 2,000, while the American force exceeded 4,000,\r\nbut wholly depending upon resources from the American side for their\r\nsubsistence, and compelled to act solely on the defensive, from the\r\nhostile front assumed by the British in the neighbourhood. The American\r\narmy of 4,000 men, being cooped up within the limits of the fort,\r\ndepending for their supplies from the United States, and not daring to\r\ngo out of their fortifications, could do little harm and be of little\r\nuse to the American cause, the British commander did not think it\r\nadvisable to incur the loss and risk of an assault upon the fort.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII.\r\n\r\nWAR IN THE WEST--GENERAL PROCTOR'S UNSUCCESSFUL SIEGE OF LOWER SANDUSKY.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime General Harrison was on the Sandusky river, making\r\npreparations to prosecute the war with vigour, in order to recover the\r\nMichigan territory, as soon as the fleet fitting out at Erie (Presqu'\r\nIsle), under Captain Perry, who had been dispatched thither by Commodore\r\nChauncey towards the end of May, should be sufficiently strong to\r\nco-operate with the land forces. General Proctor resolved to make\r\nanother effort to defeat General Harrison's purpose to recover Michigan,\r\nand immediately besieged the American fort at Lower Sandusky; but in\r\nconsequence of the withdrawment of the Indians out of the reach of the\r\nenemy's guns, and disinclined to the delay of a siege, and General\r\nHarrison with a respectable force at no great distance, General Proctor\r\nthought proper to raise the siege and retire to Amherstburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IX.\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF THE EXPEDITION OF SIR GEORGE PREVOST AND COMMODORE SIR JAMES\r\nYEO AGAINST SACKETT'S HARBOUR.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of Commodore Chauncey and his fleet from Sackett's\r\nHarbour, engaged in operations on the Niagara frontier, an expedition\r\nwas planned and fitted out at Kingston against that chief depot of\r\nAmerican naval supplies on Ontario. Sir George Prevost,\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and the British Commodore, Sir James L. Yeo (just\r\narrived from England), were both at Kingston, and much was expected from\r\ntheir joint counsels, and the arrival of some naval officers and sailors\r\nfrom England. On the 27th of May a body of 800 or 1,000 men were\r\nembarked on board the British flotilla at Kingston, consisting of\r\n_Wolfe_, 24 guns; _Royal George_, 24; _Earl of Moira_, 18; and four\r\nschooners, carrying from ten to twelve guns each, with a sufficient\r\nnumber of batteaux; and at noon the following day they were off\r\nSackett's Harbour. The weather was propitious, and the troops were\r\ntransferred to the batteaux to make their landing under an escort of\r\ntwo gun-boats, commanded by Captain Mulcaster--the whole under the\r\nimmediate direction of the land and naval commanders-in-chief. They had\r\nnot proceeded far when a convoy of American boats, loaded with troops,\r\nwas descried doubling Stanley Point, on their way from Oswego to\r\nSackett's Harbour. The Indians, who had previously landed on an island,\r\nfired upon them as they passed, and threw them into confusion, while the\r\nBritish boats and batteaux bore down and captured twelve of them, with\r\nabout 150 men; the remainder escaped to Sackett's Harbour.\r\n\r\nThe landing was deferred until next day, thus giving the Americans time\r\nto spread the alarm throughout the country--to collect reinforcements\r\nfrom all quarters--to collect and station their soldiers, with a\r\nfield-piece, in the surrounding woods, and make every possible\r\npreparation for their defence. The fine day was followed by a dark,\r\nrainy, and stormy night, which scattered the boats, so that the British\r\ncould not succeed in landing in the morning before the Americans had\r\nlined the woods with their men. Nevertheless the British succeeded in\r\nlanding; the enemy retreated, but posting themselves securely behind\r\nlarge trees, kept up a smart fire on the British.\r\n\r\nThe fleet in the meantime, as well as small vessels intended to have\r\nbeen landed in time to support the advance of the troops, were, through\r\nthe light and adverse wind, a long way in the rear. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Colonel Baynes, the Adjutant-General of the Forces in\r\nBritish North America, who was charged with this service, found it\r\nimpossible to bring up or wait for the arrival of the artillery, and\r\nordered his detachment to divide and scour the woods. The enemy,\r\ndislodged from the woods at the point of the bayonet, fled to their fort\r\nand block-houses, whither they were pursued by the British, who set fire\r\nto their barracks.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture it was thought by the commanding officer, Colonel\r\nBaynes, that the enemy's block-houses and stockaded battery could not be\r\ncarried by assault, even with the assistance of the field-pieces, had\r\nthey been landed. The fleet were still too far out of reach to aid in\r\nbattering them, while the men were exposed to the fire of the enemy,\r\nsecure within the works. The _signal of retreat_ was therefore given to\r\nthe indignant assailants, and the enterprise was abandoned at a moment\r\nwhen the enemy had so far calculated upon a victory on the part of the\r\nBritish as to set fire to their naval stores, hospital, and marine\r\nbarracks, by which all the booty previously taken at York, and the\r\nstores for their new ship, were consumed. They had also set fire to a\r\nfrigate on the stocks; but on discovering the retreat of the British,\r\nthey succeeded in suppressing the fire, and saved her. The troops were\r\nimmediately re-embarked, and returned to Kingston, after having\r\nsustained a loss of 259 in killed, wounded, and missing, while the loss\r\nof the enemy must have been double that number.\r\n\r\nThus terminated this expedition, to the disappointment of the public,\r\nwho, from the presence and co-operation of the two commanders-in-chief,\r\nfondly flattered themselves with a far more brilliant result. This\r\nmiscarriage, with other reverses at the commencement of the present\r\ncampaign, destroyed in the opinion of the enemy the invincibility our\r\narms had acquired the preceding autumn.[212]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART X.\r\n\r\nOCCURRENCES ON LAKE ONTARIO--NAVAL MANOEUVRES AND BATTLES.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Ontario the two naval commanders strove with indefatigable\r\nemulation for the dominion of the lake. Chauncey, after the capture of\r\nFort George, returned to Sackett's Harbour to await the equipment of his\r\nnew ship, the _Pike_; while his adversary, Sir James Yeo, scoured the\r\nlake, and supplied the British army in the neighbourhood of Fort George\r\nwith abundance of stores. In the early part of July, Sir James fitted\r\nout an expedition of boats for Sackett's Harbour, with a view of cutting\r\nout their new ship, then almost rigged and ready to appear on the lake.\r\nHe arrived unobserved in the vicinity of that port, and would probably\r\nhave effected his purpose had not the escape of two deserters from his\r\nparty, which had landed for refreshments, and in order to remain\r\nconcealed until night should favour the enterprise, given the alarm to\r\nthe enemy. This unlucky incident induced him to relinquish the\r\nundertaking and return to Kingston.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July the American fleet again appeared with\r\naugmented force upon the lake, and Commodore Chauncey having received a\r\ncompany of artillery, with a considerable number of troops under Colonel\r\nScott, proceeded for the head of the lake, with a view of seizing and\r\ndestroying the stores at Burlington Heights, the principal depot of the\r\narmy on the Niagara frontier, then occupied by a small detachment under\r\nMajor Maule. The design of the enemy against this depot being suspected,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Battersby, commanding the Glengarry Regiment, upon\r\nbeing notified to that effect by Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey,\r\nDeputy-Adjutant-General, moved forward from York, and, by a march of\r\nextraordinary celerity, arrived with a reinforcement in time to save the\r\ndepot, which the enemy, on finding the British ready to receive them,\r\ndid not deem it prudent to attack.\r\n\r\nCommodore Chauncey, on learning that York, by the advance of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Battersby to Burlington Heights, was left destitute\r\nof troops, seized the opportunity and bore away for that port, which he\r\nentered on the 31st of July. Here the Americans landed without\r\nopposition, and having taken possession of a small quantity of stores\r\nfound at that place, they set fire to the barracks and public\r\nstore-houses, and having re-embarked their troops, bore away to Niagara.\r\n\r\nIt is a coincidence worthy of notice, that on the same day in which the\r\nAmerican commander was employed in burning the barracks and stores at\r\nYork, Lieutenant-Colonel Murray was no less actively employed on the\r\nsame business at Plattsburg.\r\n\r\nThe British fleet sailed from Kingston on the last day of July, with\r\nsupplies for the army at the head of the lake, and on the 8th of August\r\nlooked into Niagara, where the enemy's fleet lay moored. The latter hove\r\nup and bore down upon the British fleet, with which they manoeuvred\r\nuntil the 10th, when a partial engagement ensued, in which two small\r\nvessels (the _Julia_ and _Growler_) were cut off and captured by the\r\nBritish.[213]\r\n\r\nCommodore Chauncey, somewhat disheartened with the loss of these, and\r\ntwo other small vessels--the _Scourge_ of eight, and the _Hamilton_ of\r\nnine guns--upset by press of sail to escape, with the loss of all hands,\r\nexcept sixteen men picked up by the English, bore up for Niagara, from\r\nwhence he sailed almost immediately for Sackett's Harbour, where he\r\narrived on the 13th of August. Here he provisioned his fleet, and\r\ninstantly made sail for Niagara, where he remained at anchor until the\r\nBritish fleet appeared off the harbour, early in the morning of the 7th\r\nof September, when the American fleet again weighed and bore down upon\r\nthe British fleet, with which they manoeuvred until the 12th, when the\r\nlatter returned into Amherst Bay, near Kingston. During these five days\r\nbut few shots were exchanged between the larger ships, without any\r\ninjury to either side. The Americans, however, had much the advantage in\r\nweight of metal and long guns.\r\n\r\nThe fleets again met on the 28th of September, off York, when an\r\nengagement ensued for nearly two hours, in which the _Wolfe_, commanded\r\nby Sir James Yeo, lost her main and mizen-top-masts, and would probably\r\nhave been captured had not the _Royal George_, commanded by Captain\r\nMulcaster, run in between the _Wolfe_ and the _Pike_, taking the latter\r\nin a raking position, so as to afford the _Wolfe_ an opportunity of\r\nhauling off and clearing away the wreck. This affair terminated in the\r\nretreat of the British fleet under Burlington Heights, whither the enemy\r\ndid not think proper to pursue it.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of October, the American fleet set sail from Fort George with\r\na convoy of troops for Sackett's Harbour, where an expedition was\r\npreparing whose destination was as yet unknown. The British fleet left\r\ntheir anchorage under Burlington Heights on the next day, and came in\r\nsight of the enemy; but no attempt was made to bring on a general\r\nengagement. The American fleet, on their way to Sackett's Harbour; fell\r\nin with and captured five small vessels out of seven, with upwards of\r\n250 men of De Watteville's Regiment, from York, bound for Kingston,\r\nwhere an attack was apprehended. This loss, though apparently trifling\r\nin itself, was severely felt, by reason of the few forces in the Upper\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of the season nothing of moment occurred on this lake;\r\nand indeed the naval commanders appeared to have considered the question\r\nof too great importance to their respective Governments to stake the\r\nfate of war in Upper Canada upon a decisive naval engagement.[214]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART XI.\r\n\r\nOCCURRENCES ON LAKE ERIE AND IN THE WEST--LOSS OF THE BRITISH\r\nFLEET--EVACUATION OF DETROIT AND THE TERRITORY OF MICHIGAN BY GENERAL\r\nPROCTOR, WHO IS PURSUED IN HIS RETREAT UP THE THAMES, AND DEFEATED BY\r\nGENERAL HARRISON, AND IS AFTERWARDS TRIED AND CONDEMNED TO BE SUSPENDED\r\nAND DEPRIVED OF HIS PAY FOR SIX MONTHS.\r\n\r\n_The operations on Lake Erie and in the West_ were disastrous to the\r\nBritish cause during the latter part of the summer and early autumn of\r\n1813. General Harrison, with an army of 8,000 men on the Miami river,\r\nonly awaited for the equipment of the American fleet fitting out under\r\nCommodore Perry, at Presqu' Isle (Erie), to move his forces against\r\nDetroit, and to carry on offensive operations against the British in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lake Erie. Captain Barclay, who had early in the summer\r\nassumed the command of the British squadron on Lake Erie, blockaded the\r\nAmerican fleet, so as to prevent their crossing the bar at Presqu' Isle\r\n(which they could not effect without unshipping their guns) until the\r\nend of August; when, having occasion to bear away for Long Point,[215]\r\nthe enemy seized the moment of his absence and crossed the bar. Finding\r\non his return the enemy ready for the lake, and too powerful for his\r\nsmall squadron, he bore away for Amherstburg, to await the equipment of\r\nthe _Detroit_, recently launched.\r\n\r\nCommodore Perry sailed shortly after him for the head of the lake, and\r\nappeared at the commencement of September, for several days\r\nsuccessively, off Amherstburg, in defiance of the British squadron,\r\nretiring every evening to his anchorage at _Put-in-Bay_. The British\r\nforces in Michigan territory and its neighbourhood, under General\r\nProctor, falling short of supplies for which they depended solely upon\r\nthe fleet, the captain had no other alternative than that of risking a\r\ngeneral naval engagement. With this resolution he made sail from\r\nAmherstburg on the 9th of September, manned with only fifty or sixty\r\nseamen (including a small reinforcement of thirty-six men from Lake\r\nOntario), and detachments from the 41st and Royal Newfoundland Regiment\r\nas marines. On the 10th, in the morning, the enemy's fleet was descried\r\nat anchor in _Put-in-Bay_, which immediately weighed and bore down upon\r\nthe British squadron, while the wind blowing a gentle breeze from the\r\nsouth-west, turning round to the south-east, gave the enemy the weather\r\ngage. At a quarter before twelve the British commenced firing, which was\r\nin ten minutes afterwards returned by the enemy, who bore up for close\r\naction. The engagement continued with unabated fury until half-past two,\r\nwhen the enemy's principal ship being rendered unmanageable, Commodore\r\nPerry left her in charge of his first lieutenant, Yarnal, and hoisted\r\nthe pendant on board the _Niagara_. Soon after Commodore Perry had left\r\nthe _Lawrence_, her colours were struck, but the British, from weakness\r\nof their crews and destruction of their boats, were unable to take\r\npossession of her.\r\n\r\nIt was at this anxious and interesting juncture that the fate of the day\r\nseemed to poise in favour of the British; and Commodore Perry even\r\ndespaired of the victory, when a sudden breeze revived his hopes, and\r\nturned the scale in his favour. This fortunate commander, finding the\r\n_Niagara_ had suffered lightly in the engagement, made a desperate\r\neffort to retrieve the fortune of the day, and taking advantage of the\r\nbreeze, shot ahead of the _Lady Prevost, Queen Charlotte_, and _Hunter_,\r\nraking them with her starboard guns, and engaged the _Detroit_, which,\r\nbeing raked in all directions, soon became unmanageable. The _Niagara_\r\nthen bore around ahead of the _Queen Charlotte_, and hauling up on\r\nstarboard tack, engaged that ship, giving at the same time a raking fire\r\nwith her larboard guns to the _Chippewa_ and the _Little Belt_, while\r\nthe smaller vessels, closing to grape and canister distance, maintained\r\na most destructive fire. This masterly and but too successful\r\nmanoeuvre decided the contest. Captain Barclay being severely and\r\ndangerously wounded, Captain Finnis, of the _Queen Charlotte_, killed,\r\nand every commander and officer second in command either killed or\r\ndisabled, the _Detroit_ and _Queen Charlotte_, perfect wrecks, after a\r\ndesperate engagement of upwards of three hours, were compelled to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nBy this decisive action, the whole of the British squadron on Lake Erie\r\nwas captured by the enemy, who now became masters of the lake. The enemy\r\nlost in this action twenty-seven men in killed and ninety-six men\r\nwounded. The British lost three officers and thirty-eight men killed,\r\nand nine officers and eighty-five men wounded.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were landed at Sandusky, and treated with the greatest\r\nhumanity by the American commodore, who paroled Captain Barclay, and\r\ntreated that gallant officer with all the kindness and attention which\r\nhis unsuccessful bravery deserved.\r\n\r\nThe British army in possession of the Michigan territory and the\r\nneighbourhood of Detroit, by this disastrous defeat, were deprived of\r\nevery prospect of obtaining future supplies from Kingston by way of Lake\r\nOntario, and a speedy evacuation of Detroit, and a retreat towards the\r\nhead of that lake became inevitable.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison having received reinforcements amounting to 7,000 or\r\n8,000 men, including 4,000 volunteers from Kentucky under Samuel Shelby,\r\nthe ex-governor of that State, and an old revolutionary officer, was\r\nconveyed by Commodore Perry, in his flotilla, with all the troops and\r\nstores, from the mouth of the Miami to the Canadian shore, except the\r\nthousand dragoons who were to advance by land, and so order their march\r\nthat they might arrive in the neighbourhood of Malden at the same time\r\nwith the infantry. General Harrison occupied Amherstburg the evening of\r\nthe 23rd of September, General Proctor having previously abandoned it\r\nand fallen back upon Sandwich, after having set fire to the navy yard,\r\nbarracks, and public stores at the former place.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, on his arrival, having found the different points\r\nevacuated, invested General McArthur with the chief command of these\r\ngarrisons, and prepared to pursue the retreating army up the River\r\nThames, with a force of 3,000 men, including Colonel Johnson's corps of\r\ndragoons, consisting of 1,000. General Harrison occupied Sandwich the\r\n27th of September, and on the 2nd of October he marched in pursuit of\r\nthe shattered remains of the British forces under General Proctor. In\r\nthis, his reverse of fortune, the Indians, under Colonel Elliot, of the\r\nIndian Department, with Tecumseh, still adhered to his standard with\r\nunshaken fidelity, and covered his retreat.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of October, General Harrison came up with the rear-guard of\r\nthe British, and succeeded in capturing the whole of their ammunition\r\nand stores. General Proctor, under this second reverse of fortune, by\r\nwhich he was left destitute of the means of subsistence or defence,\r\nfound himself compelled to stake the fate of the remnant of his small\r\narmy on a general engagement. Accordingly he assumed a position on the\r\nright bank of the River Thames, near the Indian village of Moravian\r\nTown--the left resting on the river supported by a field-piece, his\r\nright on a swamp, at a distance of 300 yards from the river, and flanked\r\nby the whole Indian force attached to the division. The intermediate\r\nground, covered with lofty trees, was dry and somewhat elevated. Here\r\nGeneral Proctor formed his troops into line, to the number of 500 or\r\n600. The Indians under Tecumseh amounted to 1,200. In this position he\r\nawaited the approach of the enemy, who, on the morning of the 5th of\r\nOctober, passed the river at a rapid twelve miles below the Moravian\r\nvillage, and came up with the British in the afternoon. General Harrison\r\ndrew up his men in two lines, and secured his left flank, which was\r\nopposed to the Indians, by a division thrown back _en potence_; and\r\nwithout any previous engagement by infantry, ordered his mounted\r\nKentuckians (accustomed from their boyhood to ride with extraordinary\r\ndexterity through the most embarrassed woods) to charge at full speed\r\nupon (the _open_ line of) the British, which had effected before the\r\nlatter had time to discharge their third fire. This cavalry charge of\r\nthe enemy on the British line decided the issue of the day. The line\r\ngave way at the charge; the troops, worn down with fatigue and hunger,\r\ndispirited by the unpromising appearance of the campaign, became totally\r\nrouted, and for the most part surrendered themselves prisoners, while\r\nGeneral Proctor and his personal staff sought safety in flight.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the enemy's position, which was opposed to the Indians,\r\nthe battle raged with more obstinacy. This part of the enemy's line had\r\neven given way until a column under ex-Governor Shelby was brought up to\r\nits support. These faithful allies continued to carry on the contest\r\nwith the left of the American line with furious determination,\r\nencouraged by the presence of Tecumseh, until finding all hopes of\r\nretrieving the day to be in vain--General Proctor and his soldiers\r\nhaving fled or surrendered--they yielded to the overwhelming numbers of\r\nthe enemy, and left the field--upwards of 100 of them having fallen in\r\nbattle, and the bodies of 33 of them being found around the dead body of\r\ntheir famous chief and warrior, Tecumseh; celebrated no less for his\r\nhumanity than for his bravery, his eloquence, and his influence among\r\nthe Indian allies of the British in the West.\r\n\r\nUpwards of 600 of the British, including twenty-five officers, were made\r\nprisoners of war. Those who escaped made the best of their way to\r\nAncaster, a few miles from Burlington Heights, exposed at an inclement\r\nseason to all the horrors of the wilderness, of hunger, and famine. The\r\nnumber thus escaped to that place amounted to only 246, including the\r\ngeneral and seventeen officers.\r\n\r\nThis disaster of the British arms in that quarter seems not to have been\r\npalliated by those precautions and that presence of mind which, even in\r\ndefeat, reflects lustre on a commander. In rapid retreats from a\r\npursuing enemy cumbrous and useless baggage is abandoned, and bridges\r\nand roads are destroyed and rendered as impassable as possible, in order\r\nto impede the progress of the pursuers; but General Proctor encumbered\r\nhimself with a cumbrous load of baggage, and left the bridges and roads\r\nin his rear entire, to the advantage of his pursuers. Whether this error\r\nand neglect arose from contempt of the enemy, or from disobedience of\r\nthe commanding officer's orders, is not well understood; but the defeat\r\nled to the harshest recrimination, and involved in unmerited disgrace\r\nthe division of the brave troops that had served with honour in the\r\nMichigan territory; and General Proctor was subjected to a trial by\r\ncourt-martial for his conduct in the whole affair--censured and deprived\r\nof his pay for six months.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART XII.\r\n\r\nAMERICANS BURN MORAVIAN TOWN, BEFORE RETURNING TO DETROIT--FORM ALLIANCE\r\nWITH INDIANS, WHICH THEY HAD EXCLAIMED SO MUCH AGAINST ON THE PART OF\r\nTHE BRITISH--ARE INTOXICATED WITH THEIR SUCCESSES IN THE\r\nWEST--MAGNIFICENT CLOSE OF THE YEAR 1813, AS OF 1812, IN BEHALF OF\r\nCANADIANS, BOTH IN UPPER AND LOWER CANADA--CANADIAN VICTORY OF\r\nISLE-AUX-NOIS--SPLENDID CANADIAN VICTORIES OF CHATEAUGUAY AND\r\nCHRYSTLER'S FARM--AMERICAN ARMIES RETREAT INTO WINTER QUARTERS.\r\n\r\nThe American army returned to Detroit after the battle of Moravian Town;\r\nbut before doing so, they consigned the town to the flames, assigning as\r\na justification of the savage act against the unoffending Christian\r\nMoravian Indians, a retaliation for what they called the massacre of\r\nRiver Raisin.\r\n\r\nDuring General Harrison's absence from Detroit, a few of the Indian\r\ntribes tendered their services to General McArthur, to raise the hatchet\r\nagainst the British, and their proffered services were readily\r\naccepted--showing that, according to the American rule of judging, the\r\nalliance of the Indians with the United States was quite right, while\r\nwith England it was all wrong and barbarous.\r\n\r\nThe success of the American arms on Lake Erie and its surrounding shores\r\nso intoxicated and bewildered them, that, in their subsequent movements,\r\nthey calculated upon nothing but victory and conquest, made no allowance\r\nfor failure in any point. \"Canada must now be ours\" was their exulting\r\nand arrogant language. But they had overlooked the fact that, however\r\ngloomy the prospects of the Western Canadians were in October of the\r\nyear 1813, there were remaining elements of strength with them--their\r\ncourage and zeal were unabated, and even increased, by the transactions\r\nof the months of disaster; their loyalty to their principles, and their\r\nlove of their independence, were intensified rather than enfeebled; they\r\nwould not be a _conquered people_; and before the end of the year 1813,\r\nthe American armies had to relinquish every inch of Canadian soil both\r\nin Upper and Lower Canada.\r\n\r\nBut to present a connected and intelligent view of the magnificent close\r\nof the year 1813, as was that of 1812, we must first turn to the\r\nAmerican campaigns against Lower Canada in 1813; and the defeats and\r\nwant of success for several months in Upper Canada were more than\r\ncompensated by the heroic deeds and splendid success of both the English\r\nand French defenders of Lower Canada, as well as by victories gained in\r\nUpper Canada in the months of November and December.\r\n\r\nThe Isle-aux-Nois was termed the key of Lower Canada, and its old\r\nfortifications had been repaired, and three gun-boats sent thither from\r\nQuebec. The little garrison was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nGeorge Taylor, Inspecting General Field Officer (then major of the 100th\r\nRegiment), who, apprehending, from previous private information, a\r\ncombined attack from the American naval force on Lake Champlain and the\r\ntroops in the neighbourhood of his post, commanded by the\r\nBrigadier-Generals Smyth and Clarke, lost no time in equipping the three\r\ngun-boats lying unemployed for want of seamen; and Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nTaylor having no sailors, he manned the gun-boats from his regiment,\r\nwith three artillerymen for each boat, and took the precaution to man\r\ntwo batteaux with a detachment of soldiers, for the double purpose of\r\nrendering assistance to the gun-boats in the event of their being either\r\nsunk or disabled in the engagement, or to assist in boarding if it\r\nshould be found necessary. The enemy, discovered in approaching,\r\nconsisted of the sloops of war _Growler_ and _Eagle_, fitted out in the\r\nmost complete manner, each carrying eleven guns (eighteens, twelves, and\r\nsixes), long eighteens on pivots, with complements each of fifty-five\r\nmen, comprehending a company of marines, which they had received at\r\nChamplain the evening previous to the engagement; the whole under the\r\ncommand of the United States navy. The admirable execution with their\r\nsmall arms of the two small detachments of soldiers landed on the east\r\nside of the river, and the well-directed fire from the gun-boats, of\r\nround and grape shot, completely decided the fate of the action, which\r\nthe enemy gallantly contested from half-past four to half-past eight in\r\nthe morning, and did not surrender until further resistance became\r\nutterly unavailing--one of the vessels being run aground to prevent her\r\nfrom sinking.\r\n\r\nThe whole force of the British in this affair was only 108. The men\r\nkilled on board the American vessels were thrown overboard by their\r\nsurviving comrades; the prisoners amounted to 100 men, of whom many were\r\nwounded. Of the captors, not a man was killed, and only three severely\r\nwounded. The naval force of the enemy on Lake Champlain was, by the\r\ncapture of these vessels, almost annihilated, while it afforded the\r\nBritish immediate and effectual means for offensive operations on that\r\nlake, and checked the invasion meditated on Lower Canada.\r\n\r\nThe American Government, with a view of conquering Lower Canada, had\r\nbeen at considerable pains and expense in erecting barracks, hospitals,\r\nand magazines at different points along Lake Champlain, particularly at\r\nBurlington, Plattsburg, Champlain, and Swanton, in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Canadian frontiers--all under the direction of the two American\r\ngenerals, Moore and Hampton. To counteract these movements, the captured\r\nvessels, _Growler_ and _Eagle_--re-named the _Shannon_ and _Brock_--were\r\nspeedily put in commission, and the three gun-boats being put in repair,\r\nthe small squadron was placed under the command of Captain Pring. Still\r\nthere were no sailors; but, fortunately, at this juncture the _Wasp_\r\nsloop-of-war arrived from England at Quebec, and Captain Everard, her\r\ncommander, was ordered to transfer his crew to the _Shannon_ and other\r\nvessels, and take command of the little fleet on Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of July the fleet took 900 regulars from the 13th, 100th,\r\nand 103rd Regiments, with some artillery, and a number of Canadian\r\nmilitia, who acted as batteaux men, and proceeded up the lake, landing\r\nnear Plattsburg on the 31st, without meeting any opposition--the\r\nAmerican general, Moore, with 1,500 men, having retreated at the\r\napproach of the British. Colonel John Murray, who was in command of the\r\nBritish, took possession of the arsenals, etc., and after having\r\nembarked all the warlike stores, of which a considerable quantity was\r\nfound in the arsenal, and having destroyed such as he could not\r\nconveniently take away, set fire to the enemy's arsenal, public\r\nbuildings, commissariat stores, and barracks, recently erected, and\r\ncapable of accommodating from 4,000 to 5,000 men. While the troops were\r\nthus employed during the whole of the night, Captains Everard and Pring,\r\nin the _Growler_ and _Eagle_, with a gun-boat proceeded to Burlington,\r\nwhere General Hampton lay encamped with 4,000 men, and threw that place\r\ninto the utmost consternation. Having captured and destroyed, within\r\nsight of the American forces, four vessels, Captain Everard returned to\r\nPlattsburg, where the troops were re-embarked, and proceeded to Swanton.\r\nColonel Murray, while on the way thither, sent a detachment to Champlain\r\nfor the purpose of destroying the barracks and block-house at that port.\r\nThe main body having visited Swanton, and effected the purpose of the\r\nexpedition to the fullest extent of his Excellency the Governor-General's\r\norders, returned to the Isle-aux-Nois, where they arrived the 4th of\r\nAugust, without the loss of a man, and having been completely successful.\r\n\r\nBut these successes were only preliminary to two victories remarkable in\r\nthe annals of military warfare, considering the disparity in the number\r\nand means of the parties concerned--known as the battles of\r\n_Chateauguay_ and _Chrystler's Farm_.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hampton, after having transported his force across Lake\r\nChamplain, lay encamped some days at Cumberland Head, near Plattsburg.\r\nOn the 20th of September he entered Lower Canada at Odletown, at the\r\nlower extremity of Lake Champlain, with upwards of 5,000 men. The road\r\nleading from thence to l'Acadie, and the open country in the\r\nneighbourhood of Montreal, lies through a swamp of about fifteen miles,\r\nwhich had been cut up and rendered almost impracticable by abatis since\r\nthe preceding campaign, by the Voltigeurs under Lieutenant-Colonel De\r\nSalaberry, and guarded by some Voltigeurs and Indians. Deterred by these\r\nobstructions, General Hampton evacuated Odletown on the 22nd of\r\nSeptember, and moved with his whole force westward, toward the head of\r\nChateauguay river, under pretext of the impracticability of advancing\r\nthrough the Odletown road for want of water for his cavalry and cattle,\r\nowing to the extraordinary drought of the season. Colonel De Salaberry,\r\nwith the Canadian Voltigeurs, on ascertaining the route the enemy had\r\ntaken, moved in like manner to Chateauguay, and by his skilful\r\nprecautions and arrangements of defence and attack, he gained advantage\r\nin several skirmishes with scouting and advance parties of the\r\nenemy--thus leading his Voltigeurs for the first time into action, and\r\nacquiring a just confidence in the valour of his countrymen, which a few\r\ndays afterwards they nobly exemplified under their gallant leader at\r\nChateauguay. Finally he assumed a judicious position in a thick wood on\r\nthe left bank of the Chateauguay river, at a distance of two leagues\r\nabove the Turk, or confluence of the English and Chateauguay rivers,\r\nwhere he threw up temporary breastworks of logs, covering his front and\r\nright flank with extended abatis, while his left was covered by the\r\nriver. Here he resolved to await the enemy and maintain his ground with\r\na Spartan handful of Canadians against the whole strength of the\r\ninvading army. In his rear there was a small rapid where the river was\r\nfordable; this he covered with a strong breastwork and guard; keeping at\r\nthe same time a strong picquet of the Beauharnois Militia in advance of\r\nthe right bank of the river, lest the enemy, approaching under cover of\r\nthe forest, might cross the ford and dislodge him from his ground.\r\n\r\nThe occupancy of this position General Hampton justly considered of the\r\nfirst importance to the ulterior object of the campaign against\r\nMontreal, as the country from thence to the mouth of the Chateauguay,\r\nbeing principally open and cultivated, afforded no strong points to\r\ncheck his progress to the St. Lawrence, and prevent his junction with\r\nGeneral Wilkinson's division; but which in fact was not yet in readiness\r\nto move.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hampton, in the meantime, to distract and divide the attention\r\nof the British, directed Colonel Clarke to carry on a petty warfare on\r\nthe eastern side of Lake Champlain; and that ruthless depredator\r\ninvested the settlements in Missisquoi Bay, where he plundered the\r\ninhabitants in the most wanton manner.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of October, General Hampton again entered Lower Canada,\r\nhaving early in the morning of that day dispatched his light troops and\r\na regiment of the line, under Brigadier-General Izard, to dislodge a\r\nsmall picquet of sedentary militia, at the junction of the Outarde and\r\nChateauguay rivers, where the main body arrived on the 22nd. On the\r\n24th, having opened and completed a large and practicable road from his\r\nposition at Four Corners (a distance of twenty-four miles), through\r\nwoods and morasses, which Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry, on returning\r\nfrom the Four Corners, had broken up and embarrassed with abatis,\r\nGeneral Hampton brought forward the whole of his artillery (ten\r\nfield-pieces) and stores to his new position--about seven miles from\r\nLieut.-Colonel De Salaberry's post.\r\n\r\nFrom this point General Hampton dispatched Colonel Purdy with a light\r\nbrigade, and a strong body of infantry of the line, at an early hour of\r\nthe night of the 25th, with orders to gain the Ford, and fall on the\r\nrear of Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry's position; while the main body\r\nwere to commence the attack in front. Purdy's brigade proceeded, but\r\nwere misled and bewildered in the woods, and did not gain the point of\r\nattack as directed by the commanding officer. General Hampton, however,\r\nadvanced next morning (26th October) under the expectation of having the\r\nintended attack at the Ford, and at ten o'clock made his appearance with\r\nabout _three thousand five hundred men_, under General Izard, on the\r\nhigh road leading to the abatis, and drove in a picket of twenty-five\r\nmen, who falling back on a second picket made a resolute stand, and\r\nmaintained a smart fire upon the enemy. Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry,\r\nupon hearing the musketry, promptly advanced with the light company of\r\nthe Canadian Fencibles, commanded by Captain Ferguson, and two companies\r\nof his Voltigeurs, commanded by Captains Chevalier and Jucheseau\r\nDuchesnay. The first of these companies he posted on the right, in front\r\nof the abatis, in extended order, its right skirting on the adjoining\r\nwoods and abatis, among which were distributed a few Abenaqui Indians.\r\nCaptains Chevalier and Duchesnay's companies of Voltigeurs, in extended\r\norder, occupied the ground from the left of this company to the River\r\nChateauguay, and the third company, under Captain L. Jucheseau\r\nDuchesnay, with the sedentary militia, under Captain Lougtain, were\r\nthrown back _en potence_ along the margin of the river for the purpose\r\nof flanking, or preventing a flank fire from the enemy in the event of\r\nhis appearing on the opposite side of the river. The enemy in the\r\nmeantime advanced with steadiness in open column of sections to within\r\nmusket shot, when Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry discharged his rifle\r\nas signal to commence firing, at which a mounted officer was seen to\r\nfall. The bugles sounded, and a quick fire was immediately opened upon\r\nthe enemy who wheeled up into line, and commenced a fire in battalion\r\nvollies, which, from the position of their line, was almost totally\r\nthrown to the right of the Canadians, and of no effect whatever. They,\r\nhowever, soon changed their front parallel to their adversaries, by\r\nfacing to the right, and filing up with speed, when the engagement\r\nbecame general.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of the few skirmishers, rather advanced in the centre of\r\nthe line, being mistaken by the enemy for a flight, an universal shout\r\nensued, which was re-echoed by the Canadians, and the reinforcements in\r\nreserve under Lieutenant-Colonel M'Donnell, while Lieutenant-Colonel De\r\nSalaberry as a _ruse de guerre_ (like Gideon with his trumpets and 300\r\nmen, Judges, vii.), ordered the bugles placed at intervals, in the\r\nabatis, to sound an advance; this had the desired effect, and checked\r\nthe ardour of the enemy, who suspected that the Canadians were advancing\r\nin great numbers to circumvent them. The noise of the engagement brought\r\nColonel Purdy's division on the opposite side of the river, which,\r\nhaving driven in the picket of the sedentary militia under Captain\r\nBruguier, were pressing on for the ford at which Lieutenant-Colonel De\r\nSalaberry ordered the light company of the 3rd Battalion embodied\r\nmilitia, under Captain Daly, to cross and take up the ground abandoned\r\nby the picquet, Captain Daly with his company crossed the ford, and\r\nhaving advanced fell in with and drove back the advanced guard of the\r\nAmericans on the main body, which still pressed forward and compelled\r\nhim in his turn to fall back. Having repulsed Captain Daly's company,\r\nthey were moving on in overwhelming numbers with eagerness and speed\r\nclose to the bank of the river, until opposite to Captain L. Jucheseau\r\nDuchesnay's company, which hitherto lay concealed, and now at the word\r\nof command from Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry, opened so unexpected\r\nand effectual a fire upon the enemy, as to throw him into the utmost\r\ndisorder, and to occasion a tumultuous and precipitate retreat.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hampton finding his arrangements disconcerted by the total route\r\nof the division on the right bank, withdrew his forces in good order at\r\nhalf-past two in the afternoon, without having made a single effort to\r\ncarry the abatis and entrenchments at the point of the bayonet, leaving\r\nLieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry, with scarcely 300 Canadians, masters\r\nof the field of action.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the engagement, Sir George Prevost, with\r\nMajor-General De Watteville, arrived on the ground, and witnessed in\r\nperson the judicious arrangements and successful exertions of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry and his gallant comrades and countrymen,\r\nwhose prowess on the occasion called forth the warmest encomiums of the\r\ncommander of the forces, and gave them a just claim to the disinterested\r\nand impartial applause of history.\r\n\r\nThe fatigues and privations experienced by General Hampton's troops,\r\nexposed for several weeks to the inclemency of the season, demoralized\r\nthem to the native rawness of new recruits, and rendered them no more\r\ncapable of co-operating with General Wilkinson's division in the\r\ncombined movement against Montreal. They shortly after fell back on\r\nPlattsburg and retired to winter quarters.\r\n\r\n_The Canadian Victory of \"Chrystler's Farm.\"_--The next expedition\r\nagainst Montreal was to proceed down the St. Lawrence, under the command\r\nof General Wilkinson.[216] The American forces to about 10,000 men\r\nrendezvoused towards the end of October on Grenadier Island, near\r\nKingston, where General De Rottenburgh confidently expected an attack,\r\nand was prepared for it; but General Wilkinson was not so disposed, and,\r\nafter experiencing much foul weather, commenced his movement under cover\r\nof the American fleet, and on the 3rd of November slipt into the St.\r\nLawrence with a flotilla of upwards of _three hundred_ boats of various\r\nsizes, escorted by a division of gun-boats. He proceeded to within three\r\nmiles of Prescott and landed his troops on the American shore, who\r\nproceeded downwards by land to a bay or cove, two miles below\r\nOgdensburg, in order to avoid the British batteries at Prescott, while\r\nthe flotilla passed them in the night of the 6th, with little injury\r\nfrom the cannonade of the British batteries.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the flotilla down the St. Lawrence having been\r\nascertained at Kingston, General De Rottenburgh detached a small force\r\nfrom that port, consisting of the 49th Regiment, commanded by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Plenderleath, of the 89th Regiment, and some\r\nVoltigeurs, which, when reinforced by Lieutenant-Colonel Pearson with a\r\nparty of the Canadian Fencibles from Prescott, amounted to about 800\r\nrank and file, the whole commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison, of\r\nthe 89th Regiment, and accompanied by the Deputy-Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\nThis corps of observation proceeded under the escort of a small division\r\nof gun-boats, commanded by Captain Mulcaster, R.N., in pursuit of the\r\nenemy; and on the 8th came up with them at Point Iroquois. General\r\nWilkinson had on the preceding day directed Colonel Macomb to land on\r\nthe British shore with 1,200 men, in order to clear the coast to the\r\nhead of the Long Sault, of the militia along the shore, from various\r\nparts of the country. On the 18th this division was reinforced by\r\nBrigadier-General Brown's Brigade, with a body of dragoons from the\r\nAmerican shore. On arriving at the head of the Long Sault, the whole of\r\nthe effective men, except such as were required to navigate the boats\r\ndown the Rapids, were landed under the orders of Brigadier-General Boyd,\r\nwho was to proceed down the land in the rear of General Brown's division\r\nto the foot of the Long Sault.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison, with his gun-boats, visited the\r\nAmerican post at Hamilton, where he landed and took possession of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of provisions and stores belonging to the American\r\narmy, with two pieces of ordnance. Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey, in the\r\nmeantime, followed up the enemy, who in the evening were observed\r\nadvancing from the woods in considerable numbers, with a body of\r\ncavalry; but upon receiving a few rounds from three field-pieces fell\r\nback for the night. (Some smart cannonading took place in the meantime\r\nbetween the British and American gun-boats.)\r\n\r\n_Battle of Chrystler's Farm._--On the ensuing day, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMorrison pressed so closely upon the rear of General Boyd's division as\r\nto compel him to concentrate his forces and give battle. The enemy's\r\nforce, consisting of two brigades of infantry and a regiment of cavalry,\r\namounting to _between three and four thousand men_, moved forward about\r\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon from Chrystler's Point, and attacked the\r\nBritish advance, which gradually fell back to the position which had\r\nbeen selected for the detachment to occupy--the right resting on the\r\nriver, and the left on a pine wood, between which there were about 700\r\nyards of open ground, the troops on which were thus disposed:\r\n\r\nThe flank companies of the 49th Regiment, the detachment from the\r\nCanadian regiment, with one field-piece, under Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nPearson, on the right, a little advanced on the road. Three companies of\r\nthe 89th Regiment, under Captain Barnes, with a gun, formed in echelon,\r\nwith the advance on its left supporting it. The 49th and the 89th,\r\nthrown more to the rear, with a gun, formed the main body and reserve,\r\nextending to the woods on the left, which were occupied by the\r\nVoltigeurs under Major Herriot, and the Indians under Lieutenant\r\nAnderson.\r\n\r\nAt about half past two the action became general, and the enemy\r\nendeavoured, by moving forward a brigade from his right, to turn the\r\nBritish left, but was repulsed by the 89th Regiment forming _en potence_\r\nwith the 49th Regiment, and moving forward in that direction, in\r\nechelon, followed by the 89th. When within half musket shot, the line\r\nwas formed under a heavy but irregular fire from the enemy. The 49th was\r\ndirected to charge the American guns, posted opposite the Canadian guns,\r\nbut it became necessary, when within a short distance of them, to check\r\nthis forward movement in consequence of a charge from the American\r\ncavalry on the right, lest they should wheel about and fall upon the\r\nrear; but they were received in so gallant a manner by the companies of\r\nthe 89th under Captain Barnes, and the well-directed fire of the\r\nartillery, that they quickly retreated; and by a charge from those\r\ncompanies one gun was gained. The enemy immediately concentrated their\r\nforce to check the British advance, but such was the steady continuance\r\nand well-directed fire of the troops and artillery that about half-past\r\nfour they gave way at all points from an exceeding strong position,\r\nendeavouring by their light infantry to cover their retreat, who were\r\nsoon driven away by a judicious movement made by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nPearson.\r\n\r\nThe British detachment for the night occupied the ground from which the\r\nenemy had been driven.\r\n\r\nThis (called the Battle of Chrystler's Farm, from the ground on which it\r\noccurred) is, in the estimation of military men, considered the\r\nhandsomest affair during the war, from the professional skill displayed\r\nin the course of the action by the adverse commanders; and when we\r\nconsider the prodigious preparations of the American Government for that\r\nexpedition, with the failure of which their hopes of conquest banished,\r\nthe battle of Chrystler's Farm may be classed as an event of the first\r\nimportance in the defence of the Canadas.\r\n\r\nThe American division, after leaving the field, re-embarked in haste,\r\nwhile the dragoons, with five field-pieces of light artillery, proceeded\r\ndown towards Cornwall, in the rear of General Brown's division, who,\r\nunaware of the battle of Chrystler's Farm, had continued his march for\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the enemy, by their own statements, amounted to three\r\nofficers and ninety-nine men killed, and sixteen officers and one\r\nhundred and twenty-one men wounded. The loss of the British amounted to\r\nthree officers (Captain Nairne of the 49th Regiment, and Lieutenants\r\nLorimier and Armstrong), and twenty-one men killed, and one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven wounded, and twelve missing.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wilkinson, who, during the action, lay confined to his barge\r\nfrom a protracted illness, in his official despatch to his Government,\r\nbears strong testimony to the loyalty of the inhabitants on the Canada\r\nside of the St. Lawrence, and to the bravery and discipline of the\r\ntroops he had to contend with at Chrystler's Farm.\r\n\r\nThe day after the engagement, the American flotilla proceeded down the\r\nLong Sault, and joined near Cornwall the division which had moved\r\ntowards that place, where General Wilkinson confidently expected to hear\r\nof the arrival of General Hampton on the opposite shore, to whom he had\r\nwritten on the 6th, to that effect, not being then acquainted with his\r\nlate defeat. Here, to his unspeakable mortification and surprise, he\r\nreceived a letter from General Hampton, informing him that the division\r\nunder his command was falling back upon Lake Champlain.[217]\r\n\r\nThis information, with the countless difficulties momentarily crowding\r\nupon the American army, effectually blasted every prospect of further\r\nsuccess. So circumstanced, the American commander immediately held a\r\nCouncil of War, in which it was unanimously resolved, \"That the attack\r\nupon Montreal should be abandoned for the present season, and that the\r\narmy near Cornwall should immediately cross to the American shore, in\r\norder to take up winter quarters,\" a resolution which was carried into\r\neffect the following day, by their proceeding for Salmon river, where\r\ntheir boats and batteaux were scuttled, and extensive barracks for the\r\nwhole army were erected with extraordinary celerity, surrounded on all\r\nsides by abatis, so as to render a surprise unpracticable.\r\n\r\nEvery appearance of danger having subsided, the commander of the\r\nCanadian forces dismissed the sedentary militia, by a General Order of\r\nthe 17th of November, with acknowledgments of the cheerful alacrity with\r\nwhich they had repaired to their posts, and the loyalty and zeal they\r\nhad manifested at the prospect of encountering the enemy.\r\n\r\nWith these operations terminated the campaigns of 1813 in Lower Canada;\r\nbut new triumphs still awaited the British arms in the Province of\r\nUpper Canada before the end of the year.[218]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART XIII.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DRUMMOND ARRIVES IN UPPER CANADA--COLONEL MURRAY SENT TO ARREST\r\nTHE PREDATORY INCURSIONS OF THE BRUTAL GENERAL McCLURE UPON THE\r\nINHABITANTS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF FORT GEORGE--McCLURE'S BARBAROUS\r\nBURNING OF THE TOWN OF NEWARK (NIAGARA), EXPOSING 400 WOMEN AND CHILDREN\r\nTO THE INTENSE COLD OF THE 10TH OF DECEMBER--McCLURE'S FLIGHT TO FORT\r\nNIAGARA ON THE AMERICAN SIDE OF THE RIVER--COLONEL MURRAY, BY SURPRISING\r\nFORT NIAGARA, TAKES THE WHOLE GARRISON PRISONERS, AND SEIZES LARGE\r\nQUANTITIES OF MILITARY STORES--GENERAL RIALL RETALIATES IN THE SAME WAY,\r\nIN REGARD TO LEWISTON, BLACK ROCK, AND BUFFALO--GENERAL DRUMMOND ISSUES\r\nA PROCLAMATION DEPRECATING SUCH SAVAGE POLICY AS INITIALED BY THE\r\nAMERICAN GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, Major General De Rottenburgh was relieved in the\r\ncommand of Upper Canada by Lieutenant-General Drummond, who proceeded\r\nfrom Kingston to York, and from thence to the head of the lake, where\r\nthe army again resumed an offensive position. The country along the St.\r\nLawrence, being freed from the incursions of the enemy, Colonel Murray,\r\nof the 100th Regiment, was ordered to advance from Burlington Heights\r\ntowards Fort George, with a view at that time to prevent predatory\r\nincursions of the enemy under General McClure (then in possession of\r\nthat fort) on the defenceless inhabitants of the surrounding country.\r\nBut General McClure, having heard of the disasters which had befallen\r\nthe army destined for Montreal, and conscious that a like fate might\r\nprobably await him and his army, with that dastardly cowardice peculiar\r\nto himself and a few of his compatriots and traitors who joined\r\nthemselves to his train, and against the very spirit of the law of\r\nnations and of civilized warfare, immersed the flourishing town of\r\nNewark (Niagara) in one continued sheet of flame, and ignobly fled with\r\nhis followers into his territory. The historian laments that it is not\r\nin his power to record one magnanimous act of that recreant General, to\r\nrescue his name from that gulf of infamy to which his nefarious conduct\r\nhas forever doomed it.[219]\r\n\r\nBut retaliation was only delayed a week. On the evening of the 18th of\r\nDecember, preparations were made for taking Fort Niagara from the enemy,\r\nfor which service Colonel Murray, of the 100th Regiment, was selected to\r\ntake the command; and long before daylight next morning this gallant\r\nofficer, at the head of the grenadier company of the Royal Scots, the\r\ngrenadier and light companies of the 41st Regiment, and a detachment of\r\nhis own corps, crossed the river about two miles above the fort, upon\r\nwhich they immediately advanced. On approaching the fortress, sentries,\r\nplanted on the outer works, were surprised and taken, the countersign\r\nobtained, and in a few minutes the fort was carried at the point of the\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\nThe loss on the part of the British in this affair was only six killed\r\nand five wounded: that of the enemy amounted to sixty-five killed and\r\nfourteen wounded (all with the bayonet), and the whole garrison was made\r\nprisoners, consisting of nearly 350. There were in the fort, at the time\r\nof its capture, twenty-seven pieces of ordnance of weighty calibre,\r\n3,000 muskets with apparatus, besides large magazines of camp equipage\r\nand military clothing, which of course fell into the hands of the\r\nvictors.\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which Fort Niagara was captured, the town of\r\nLewiston, about eight miles above Fort Niagara, was taken possession of\r\nby a British force under Major-General Riall, without opposition; in\r\nwhich place the public magazines were well filled with provisions and\r\nother military stores.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of the same month, General Riall crowed the\r\nNiagara river at Black Rock, at the head of a force consisting of about\r\n600 men, detachments from the 8th or the King's Regiment, 41st, 89th,\r\nand 100th Regiments, with a few Militia volunteers, exclusive of six or\r\nseven companies of the Royal Scots, under the command of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Gordon, who were directed to land between the\r\nvillages of Buffalo and Black Rock, about two miles distant from each\r\nother, with a view to divert the garrison of Black Rock, while the other\r\ntroops were landing in front of that port; but in consequence of the\r\nseverity of the weather, a number of the boats were stranded; by which\r\nmeans the troops were unable to land in time to effect the object for\r\nwhich they had been intended; however, the enemy was driven from both\r\npositions in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe American loss in this affair was upwards of five hundred, 130 of\r\nwhom were prisoners of war; the loss of the British was inconsiderable\r\ncompared with that of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe state of exasperation to which the mind of every British subject had\r\nbeen wrought by the conduct of McClure in burning the town of Newark,\r\nand exposing all to the inclemency of a Canadian winter, both the\r\nhelpless infant and infirm old age, was such that nothing but a similar\r\nretaliation could assuage; the whole line of frontier, from Buffalo to\r\nFort Niagara, was therefore burnt to ashes.\r\n\r\nAmple vengeance having thus been taken for the wanton conflagration and\r\ncruel outrages committed upon the defenceless inhabitants of Newark and\r\nneighbourhood, Lieutenant-General Drummond, on the 12th of January,\r\n1814, issued a proclamation, in which he strongly deprecated the savage\r\nmode of warfare to which the enemy, by a departure from the established\r\nusages of war, had compelled him to resort. He traced with faithful\r\nprecision and correctness the conduct that had marked the progress of\r\nthe war on the part of the enemy, and concluded by lamenting the\r\nnecessity imposed upon him of retaliating upon the subjects of America\r\nthe miseries inflicted upon the inhabitants of Newark, but at the same\r\ntime declared it not to be his intention further to pursue a system so\r\nrevolting to his own feelings, and so little congenial to the British\r\ncharacter, unless he should be compelled by the future measures of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: Thompson's History of the War of 1812, Chap. xxii., pp.\r\n179-181.\r\n\r\n\"Terms of capitulation were agreed upon, by which the whole of General\r\nWinchester's command that had survived the fury of the battle were\r\nsurrendered prisoners of war, amounting to upwards of 600.

It is not\r\nascertained whether his removal was the result of the displeasure of the\r\ncommander of the forces [Sir George Prevost]; but upon a cool survey of\r\nthe battle of York, it must be owned that the honour of the British arms\r\nwas strenuously and ably maintained by the small party of men under his\r\ncommand, who, including regulars, militia, and Indians, did not exceed\r\n600.\" (Christie's History of the War of 1812, Chap. v., p. 105.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Among the killed of the British party was Mr. Allan\r\nMacLean, Clerk of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada, who volunteered\r\nhis services with a musket.\r\n\r\n\"The Americans moved forward in three strong brigades, under Generals\r\nChandler, Winder, and Boyd, with an advance of light troops and\r\nriflemen, under Colonels Scott and Forsyth, the whole commanded by\r\nGeneral Lewis, the next in command to General Dearborn, whose low state\r\nof health compelled him to keep his bed, from whence he issued his\r\norders.\" (Thompson's History of the War of 1812, Chap, xxiii., p. 185.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: Thompson's War of 1812, Chap. xxiii.\r\n\r\nIn General Vincent's official despatch relating to this brilliant and\r\nintrepid action, he gives the credit of it to Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey.\r\nHe says: \"To Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey, the Deputy-Adjutant-General, my\r\nobligations are particularly due.

The _General\r\nPike_, of twenty-two guns, having been launched, and proving to be an\r\nexcellent sailer, Commodore Chauncey was now fully equal, in point of\r\nstrength, to his antagonist. Sir James Yeo, though somewhat inferior in\r\nforce, had the advantage in an important particular: his ships sailed\r\nbetter in squadron, and he could therefore avoid or come to an\r\nengagement as he thought proper. It being a matter all-important to the\r\nBritish, to prevent the Americans from becoming masters of the lake, Sir\r\nJames prudently avoided a general action; while, on the other hand, to\r\nbring him to action was the great object of Commodore Chauncey. On the\r\n7th of August the two fleets came in sight of each other. Commodore\r\nChauncey manoeuvred to gain the wind. Having passed to the leeward of\r\nthe enemy's line, and being abreast of his warship, the _Wolfe_, he\r\nfired a few guns to ascertain whether he could reach the hostile fleet.\r\nThe shot falling short, he wore, and hauled upon a wind to the starboard\r\ntack; the rear of his schooners being six miles astern. Sir James wore\r\nalso, and hauled upon a wind on the same tack; but observing that the\r\nAmerican fleet would be able to weather him in the next tack, he tacked\r\nagain and made sail to the northward. Commodore Chauncey pursued him. He\r\ncontinued the chase until night; but the schooners not being able to\r\nkeep up, a signal was made to relinquish the pursuit, and to form in\r\nclose order. The wind now blew heavily; and at midnight two of the\r\nschooners, the _Scourge_ and the _Hamilton_, were found to have upset in\r\nthe squall. Lieutenants Winter and Osgood, two valuable officers, were\r\nlost, and only sixteen men of the crews saved [picked up by the\r\nBritish]. The next morning, the enemy discovering this misfortune, and\r\nhaving now the superiority, manifested a disposition to engage the\r\nAmericans, and bore up for the purpose. Two schooners were ordered to\r\nengage him; but when they were within a mile and a-half of him, he\r\nattempted to cut them off. Failing in this, he hauled his wind, and hove\r\nto. A squall coming on, Commodore Chauncey was fearful of being\r\nseparated from his dull sailing schooners, and ran in towards Niagara\r\nand anchored. Here he received on board, from Fort George, 150 men to\r\nact as marines, and distributed them through his fleet. On the morning\r\nof the 9th he again sailed. At eleven o'clock, after much manoeuvring\r\non both sides, the rear of the enemy's line opened its fire; and in\r\nfifteen minutes the action became general on both sides. At half-past\r\neleven, the American weather line bore up and passed to the leeward, the\r\n_Growler_ and _Julia_ excepted, which soon after tacking to the\r\nsouthward, brought the British between them and the remainder of the\r\nAmerican fleet. Sir James, after exchanging a few shots with the\r\nAmerican commodore's ship, pursued the _Growler_ and _Julia_. A fire\r\ncommenced between them, which continued until one o'clock in the morning\r\nof the 10th, when, after a desperate resistance, the two schooners were\r\ncompelled to yield. The fleets had lost sight of each other in the\r\nnight; but as Sir James, on the next day, when they were again visible,\r\nshowed no disposition to renew the action, Commodore Chauncey returned\r\nto Sackett's Harbour. A victory for this affair was claimed for the\r\nBritish commander.\" (Brackenridge's History of the War of 1812, etc.,\r\nChap, viii., pp. 121, 122.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Christie, Chap, v., pp. 126--130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: It was this episode in Captain Barclay's proceedings\r\nwhich resulted in the loss of British supremacy on Lake Erie, the loss\r\nof his fleet, his own wounding, the death of most of his officers and\r\nsailors, General Proctor's compulsory evacuation of Detroit and the\r\nMichigan territory, his retreat into Canada, his defeat on the Thames at\r\nthe Moravian village, involving the loss of many of his men, with\r\nupwards of 100 Indians, including famous Chief Tecumseh.

Mr. Christie says that McClure \"having,\r\npursuant to the directions of the American Secretary at War, most\r\ninhumanly, on the 10th of December, set fire to the flourishing village\r\nof Newark, containing about 150 houses, which Were reduced to ashes,\r\nleaving the wretched and forlorn inhabitants, with upwards of 400 women\r\nand children, exposed to the accumulated horrors of famine and the\r\ninclemency of a Canadian winter.\"\r\n\r\nThe British, under the command of Colonel Murray, scarcely amounting to\r\n500 men, including Indians and militia, immediately occupied Fort\r\nGeorge. The barbarous policy of the American Government in destroying\r\nNewark, exasperated the army as well as the inhabitants on the frontier,\r\nof whose impatience for retaliation General Drummond promptly availed\r\nhimself after the occupation of Fort George, by adopting the resolution\r\nof carrying the American Fort Niagara by surprise. (Chap. vii., p.\r\n156.)\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson remarks on the conduct of McClure and his soldiers, even\r\nbefore the burning of the town of Newark: \"The American army had no\r\nsooner taken up a position in front of Fort George, than the foraging\r\nparties, or rather marauders, commenced a systematic course of plunder\r\nupon the defenceless inhabitants within the vicinity of their camp, most\r\nof whom, at the time, consisted of women and children; even amongst the\r\ngeneral officers acts of pillage were perpetrated, that, had such\r\noccurred with private soldiers in the British army, would have stamped a\r\nstigma on the character of the British, in the eyes of America, for\r\nwhich no course of conduct which they could ever after have pursued\r\nwould have sufficiently atoned.\" (War of 1812, Chap. xxix., pp. 227,\r\n228.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS AND CAMPAIGNS OF 1814--THE THIRD AND LAST YEAR OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE CAMPAIGN--REINFORCEMENTS FROM NEW BRUNSWICK--ROYAL\r\nAPPROBATION OF CANADIAN LOYALTY AND COURAGE--AMERICAN INVASION OF THE\r\nDISTRICT OF MONTREAL UNDER GENERAL WILKINSON--THE LARGE FORCE OF\r\nAMERICANS DEFEATED AT LE COLLE BY A SMALL FORCE OF CANADIANS--RETURN TO\r\nPLATTSBURG, WHERE GENERAL WILKINSON, DISAPPOINTED AND MORTIFIED, RETIRES\r\nFROM THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nThe total failure for two years of the expeditions which had been fitted\r\nout at so much expense by the United States Government for the invasion\r\nof Canada, had considerably subdued that ardour for military renown\r\nwhich, at the commencement of the war--from the defenceless state of\r\nCanada, and the absorption of British strength in the European war--had\r\npromised so rich a harvest of laurels and territory to the United\r\nStates. Nevertheless the most active exertions were made on both sides\r\nduring the winter for the ensuing campaign. Stores of all descriptions\r\nwere forwarded to Kingston from Quebec and Montreal on sleighs, at\r\nprodigious expense. The inhabitants of New Brunswick again evinced their\r\nloyalty and patriotism. Lieutenant-Colonel Robinson, with a regiment,\r\nmarched through the woods from Fredericton to the St. Lawrence, in the\r\nmonth of February. A reinforcement of 220 seamen for the lakes came by\r\nthe same route. To expedite the progress of these reinforcements, the\r\nLegislature of New Brunswick voted £300, and the city of St. John gave\r\na similar sum to defray the expense of conveying the troops and sailors\r\non sleighs as far as the nature of the roads would permit.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March, His Excellency Sir George Prevost issued a General\r\nOrder expressing the approbation of the Prince Regent of the affair of\r\nChateauguay, and his \"peculiar pleasure at finding that His Majesty's\r\nCanadian subjects had at length the opportunity of refuting, by their\r\nown brilliant exertions in defence of their country, the calumnious\r\ncharges of disaffection and disloyalty with which the enemy had prefaced\r\nhis first invasion of the province, to Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry\r\nin particular, and to all the officers and men under his command, the\r\nsense entertained by his Royal Highness of their meritorious and\r\ndistinguished services, was made known.\"\r\n\r\nThe first movement of the Americans in the neighbourhood of Lake\r\nChamplain which gave room to expect an American invasion of the district\r\nof Montreal, was towards the conclusion of March, 1814, when\r\nBrigadier-General Macomb, with a division of American forces from\r\nPlattsburg, crossed Lake Champlain upon the ice, and entered St. Armand,\r\nwhere he remained some days, while General Wilkinson prepared for an\r\nattack upon the outposts of Odletown and the Le Colle Mill, which had\r\nbeen converted into a block-house. On the morning of the 13th of March\r\n(General Macomb having suddenly withdrawn his division from St.\r\nArmand's, and rejoined the main body), the American forces, consisting\r\nof 5,000 men, commanded by General Wilkinson in person, entered\r\nOdletown. The Americans repeated their attacks upon the coveted Le Colle\r\nMill frontier; and the Canadian Fencibles, Frontier Light Infantry, and\r\nthe Voltigeurs, repeated their deeds of bravery and heroism, and\r\nrepelled the multitudinous invaders. \"The Americans,\" says Mr. Christie,\r\n\"exhausted with cold and fatigue, and finding it impossible to carry the\r\nplace without heavy artillery, which, from the state of the roads, could\r\nnot be brought forward, withdrew their forces in good order from the\r\ncontest, at five o'clock in the afternoon, without being pursued in the\r\nretreat.\"\r\n\r\nThe British loss amounted to only ten men killed and four men missing,\r\nand two officers and forty-four men wounded. The American loss, though\r\nconsiderable, could not be precisely ascertained.\r\n\r\nHaving failed in the attempt to carry the block-house (Le Colle Mill),\r\nscarcely deserving the appellation of a military post, the enemy fell\r\nback upon Champlain Town, from whence they returned to Plattsburg.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wilkinson, after this abortive attempt to retrieve his military\r\nfame, seems to have been removed from his command, or to have sought\r\nvoluntary retirement from a service in which he had experienced nothing\r\nbut disappointment and reverses.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTAKING OF PRAIRIE DU CHIEN--DEFENCE OF MACKINAC--SUCCESS IN THE MARITIME\r\nPROVINCES.\r\n\r\nBefore noticing the military campaign of Upper Canada, we will complete\r\nthe summary view of those which relate to the Maritime Provinces and\r\nLower Canada.\r\n\r\nDuring the occurrences of the taking of the post of _Prairie du Chién_,\r\non the Mississippi, and the triumphant defence of _Michilimackinac_,\r\nLieutenant-General Sir John C. Sherbrook, the Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nNova Scotia, was successful in reducing a very populous and extensive\r\nportion of the enemy's territories adjacent to the Provinces of New\r\nBrunswick. He detached a small force from Halifax under Colonel\r\nPilkington, while the _Ramilies_, commanded by Sir Thomas Hardie, took\r\npossession, on the 10th of July, of Mosé Island, in Passamaquoddy Bay;\r\nthe garrison at Fort Sullivan, consisting of six officers and eighty\r\nmen, under the command of Major Putman, surrendering themselves\r\nprisoners of war.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of August, Sir John C. Sherbrook, having embarked at Halifax\r\nthe whole of his disposable forces on board of ten transports, set sail,\r\naccompanied by a small squadron under Rear-Admiral Griffith, for\r\nCastine, on the Penobscot river, where he arrived on the 1st of\r\nSeptember, and took possession of the batteries at that place; the enemy\r\nfinding it impossible to retain the post--having previously blown up the\r\nmagazine, and retreated with the field-pieces.\r\n\r\nThe United States frigate _Adams_ had, some days previous to the arrival\r\nof the British at Castine, run into the Penobscot river, and for\r\nsecurity had gone up as far as Hampden, where her guns had been landed\r\nand a position taken, with a view of protecting her. Captain Barrie, of\r\nthe _Dragon_, with a suitable naval force, and 600 picked men under the\r\ncommand of Colonel John, of the 6th Regiment, were detached up the river\r\nfor the purpose of possessing or destroying the _Adams_. The enemy, who\r\nat first offered a spirited resistance, after setting fire to the\r\nfrigate, fled in all directions, upon finding the British resolutely\r\nadvancing against their positions. Several pieces of ordnance and three\r\nstands of colours fell into the hands of the British, whose loss\r\namounted to no more than one man killed, and one officer and seven men\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Castine, Lieutenant-Colonel Pilkington was\r\ndespatched with a brigade of troops for Madrias, which was taken\r\npossession of on the 11th of September by that officer--the detachment\r\nin Fort O'Brien having, on the approach of the British, precipitately\r\nretreated from the fort, leaving twenty-six pieces of ordnance, with a\r\nquantity of small arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Pilkington was on the point of marching into the\r\ninterior of the country when he received a communication from\r\nLieutenant-General Brewer, commander of the district, engaging that the\r\nmilitia forces within the County of Washington should not bear arms, or\r\nserve against his Britannic Majesty during the war. This, with a similar\r\noffer made by the civil officers and principal inhabitants of the\r\ncounty, brought on a cessation of arms.\r\n\r\nBy these judicious measures a populous extent of territory, stretching\r\none hundred miles along the sea coast, including a valuable tract of\r\ncountry partly separating New Brunswick from Lower Canada, passed under\r\nthe dominion of the British arms, without effusion of blood or the least\r\nwaste of treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nENGLAND, FREE FROM THE EUROPEAN WAR, DETERMINES TO PUNISH THE UNITED\r\nSTATES FOR THEIR JUNCTION WITH NAPOLEON AND INVASION OF CANADA--SWEEPS\r\nTHE AMERICAN COASTS WITH HER FLEET, AND SENDS REINFORCEMENTS OF 16,000\r\nMEN TO CANADA--FAILURE OF SIR GEORGE PREVOST'S ATTACK ON PLATTSBURG--HIS\r\nRECALL, AND SUMMONED TO BE TRIED BY COURT-MARTIAL--DIES BEFORE THE\r\nAPPOINTED DAY OF TRIAL--ESTIMATE OF HIS CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nHitherto, for more than two years, the colonies had been thrown almost\r\nentirely upon their own prowess and resources, with the assistance of a\r\nfew British soldiers, for their own defence against an invading enemy\r\nfifty times more populous than themselves. Up to this time England had\r\nbeen struggling against Napoleon for the liberties of Europe; but now\r\nthe Corsican tiger was chained up in Elba; peace once more reigned in\r\nEurope, and England was now free to throw the whole weight of her\r\nvictorious armies and unconquerable navy against the United States,\r\nwhose treasury was bankrupt, whose people were disheartened at the\r\nreverses inflicted on their armies by handfuls of British and Canadians\r\nopposed to them, and whose loudest cry now was for peace; but the United\r\nStates had refused peace when she could have had it, and Great Britain\r\nwas now determined to punish her for her attacks on a peaceful colony,\r\nwhen the mother country was so thoroughly engaged elsewhere as to be\r\nalmost forced to leave it to its own resources. Of the vigorous blockade\r\nof the American seaports, of the capture of Washington and burning of\r\nthe capitol, etc., it is not necessary to speak in this place; we have\r\nonly to do at present with the operations which took place in Canada\r\nduring the summer of 1814.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer about 16,000 British troops arrived at Quebec; but\r\nonly 4,000 were sent to Upper Canada, under the command of General\r\nKempt; and the Governor-General, Prevost, concentrated nearly the whole\r\nof the remainder of the reinforcements in the Richelieu district, with a\r\nview to a descent on the State of New York by way of Lake Champlain, at\r\nPlattsburg. In order to do this, the co-operation of the flotilla on the\r\nlake was considered necessary, and orders were given to put it in an\r\nefficient condition; but the flotilla was defeated and its vessels\r\ntaken by the enemy; and the land forces, though they could have easily\r\ntaken Plattsburg, did nothing, and were ordered to retreat within the\r\nBritish lines. The conduct of Sir George Prevost in this\r\naffair--undertaken for his own ambition, and without any public\r\nnecessity--lost him all his military prestige; both officers and men\r\nfelt the disgrace of retreating before an inferior force of militia; the\r\nvaliant Colonel Murray and other officers protested against the retreat,\r\nand some of them indignantly broke their swords, declaring that they\r\nwould never serve under him again. He was recalled to England, and under\r\ncharges by Commodore Sir James Yeo, was arraigned before a\r\ncourt-martial, but died a week before the day appointed for his trial.\r\nThough Sir George Prevost was unsuccessful as a military\r\ncommander--having disgracefully failed in the only two expeditions which\r\nhe planned and personally superintended--the one against Sackett's\r\nHarbour and the other against Plattsburg--he was an excellent civil\r\ngovernor for Lower Canada, and an amiable and upright man.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged, however, that the Duke of Wellington and other high\r\nauthorities approved of his conduct, and the Prince Regent showed marks\r\nof kindness to his family after his death. His health, which was never\r\nstrong, suffered much, not only from mortification and mental anxiety in\r\nregard to his approaching trial (which he demanded at the earliest\r\npossible period), but by a winter's journey across the open country\r\nbetween the St. Lawrence and St. John, on his way home, that he died on\r\nthe 5th of January, 1816, just one week before the court-martial\r\nappointed to examine into his conduct was to have been convened.\r\n\r\nMr. Christie, who was an English member of the Legislative Assembly of\r\nLower Canada, and the author of an elaborate History of Canada, in six\r\nvolumes, beside his excellent \"History of the War of 1812,\" gives the\r\nfollowing estimate of the character and Administration of Sir George\r\nPrevost:\r\n\r\n\"A warm and unswerving friend of the Canadian population, of French\r\norigin, he confided in and liberally patronized them from the\r\ncommencement to the close of his administration; and they, it must be\r\nacknowledged, as generously responded to his confidence in them. No\r\ncountry or people ever exhibited greater unanimity or patriotism than\r\ndid the people of Lower Canada of both origins, in the war of 1812 by\r\nthe United States against Great Britain--a stand the more to be\r\nremembered by her Government, as these colonies, almost destitute of\r\ntroops, wholly so of money, and scarcely possessing even a sufficiency\r\nof arms and other munitions of defence, owing to the more imperious\r\ncalls from other quarters upon the Home Government, were, at the outset\r\nof the war, in a manner left to their own action and resources, and\r\nwhich they nobly exemplified, single-handed, as it were, throughout the\r\nfirst two campaigns. The principles of loyalty and duty, no doubt, were\r\ndeeply implanted in the bosom of the people; but he it was who exalted\r\nthem into enthusiasm and inspired the mass with a confidence in their\r\nown exertions and a reliance upon his wisdom, fitting them for the\r\nemergency, and that bore them successfully through the contest. Whatever\r\nmay be the opinion now established of his talents, by the military\r\nworld, the impression which the inhabitants of French origin in Lower\r\nCanada universally retain of him, is that of a conciliatory, wise, and\r\nable civil governor, and in all the relations of private life, an\r\namiable and estimable man.\"[220]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nUPPER CANADA--PREPARATIONS FOR THE CAMPAIGN--THE BRITISH FLEET INFERIOR\r\nON LAKE ONTARIO--SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION AGAINST OSWEGO--DESTRUCTION OF\r\nFORTIFICATIONS AND SEIZURE OF MUNITIONS OF WAR--BLOCKADES SACKETT'S\r\nHARBOUR--UNSUCCESSFUL ASCENT OF SANDY CREEK.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Canada the occurrences during the winter of 1814 were\r\nprincipally confined to incursions reciprocally practised by troops in\r\nadvance along the frontiers with various successes, but with no\r\nimportant results on either side. After the winter's preparations, the\r\ncampaign was opened in Upper Canada by Sir Gordon Drummond and Sir James\r\nL. Yeo, under most cheering circumstances. The American forces along the\r\nLake Champlain, after leaving small garrisons at Plattsburg, Burlington,\r\nand Vergennes, moved early in the spring towards Lake Ontario and the\r\nNiagara frontier, with a view of assuming offensive operations against\r\nUpper Canada, as soon as the fleet in Sackett's Harbour (considerably\r\naugmented during the winter) should be in a state to co-operate with the\r\nland forces. The principal naval stores for the equipment of the fleet\r\nwere forwarded to Sackett's Harbour by the way of Oswego; and as the\r\nBritish naval force at Kingston, strengthened by two additional ships,\r\nthe _Prince Regent_ and the _Princess Charlotte_, were ready to appear\r\non the lake early in the season, it became an object of importance to\r\nintercept the enemy's supplies, and by that means retard his\r\npreparations for invasion. An _expedition against Oswego_ was therefore\r\ndetermined upon, and General Drummond having embarked a considerable\r\nforce, consisting of six companies of De Watteville's Regiment, the\r\nLight Company of Glengarries, the 2nd Battalion of Royal Marines, with a\r\ndetachment of Royal Artillery, and two field-pieces, a detachment of the\r\nRocket Company, with a few Sappers and Miners, set sail from Kingston\r\nthe 4th of May, and at noon on the following day made the port of\r\nOswego, when a heavy gale from the north-west sprung up and obliged the\r\nsquadron to gain the offing. On the morning of the 6th, a landing was\r\neffected by about 140 of the troops, under Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher,\r\nand 200 seamen, armed with pikes, under the command of Captain\r\nMulcaster, R.N., in front of a heavy discharge of round and grape from\r\nthe battery, and of musketry from a detachment of about 300 men of the\r\nAmerican army, posted on the brow of the hill, and in the skirts of the\r\nneighbouring wood. The British, on landing, pressed up the hill towards\r\nthe enemy's battery, which the Americans (upon finding the British\r\ndetermined to carry it by storm) relinquished, leaving about sixty men,\r\nprincipally wounded.\r\n\r\nThe land and naval commanders having taken possession of the stores\r\nfound in the fort and its neighbourhood, and having dismantled the\r\nfortifications and destroyed the barracks, re-embarked on the 7th of\r\nMay, and returned to Kingston.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the British troops amounted to one captain (Holtaway, of the\r\nMarines) and eighteen men killed, and two officers and sixty men\r\nwounded. That of the navy amounted to three men killed, and four\r\nofficers and seven men wounded. Captain Mulcaster, while entering the\r\nfort at the head of his men, received a very severe and dangerous\r\nwound. Captain Popham was also severely wounded.\r\n\r\nAlthough the service derived much benefit from this expedition, the main\r\nobject contemplated was not accomplished, the principal part of the\r\nnaval stores being saved by the enemy, who had taken the precaution of\r\ndepositing them at the Falls, some miles from Oswego, up the river.\r\n\r\nThe British squadron having, for the present, a decided ascendency on\r\nLake Ontario, blockaded Sackett's Harbour, in order to intercept the\r\nsupplies which might, from time to time, be forwarded from Oswego for\r\nthe equipment of the American fleet. On the 29th of May, they captured a\r\nboat laden with two twenty-four-pounders, and a large cable for one of\r\nthe American ships of war, and, with two gun-boats and five barges,\r\npursued fifteen other boats, loaded with naval and military stores, and\r\nwhich took shelter in Sandy Creek; but they were met in the Creek by an\r\nAmerican force, consisting of 150 riflemen, nearly 200 Indians, and a\r\nstrong body of militia and cavalry, which overpowered the British party,\r\nof whom eighteen were killed and fifty wounded--the rest being taken\r\nprisoners. Captain Popham, in his official dispatch to Sir James L. Yeo,\r\non this affair, acknowledged with warmest gratitude the humane exertions\r\nof the American officers of the Rifle Corps, commanded by Major Appling,\r\nin saving the lives of many of the officers and men, whom the American\r\nsoldiers and Indians were devoting to slaughter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: History of the War of 1812.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nLAST INVASIONS AND LAST BATTLES OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BROWN TAKES FORT ERIE--DEFEATS GENERAL RIALL ON THE PLAINS OF\r\nCHIPPEWA--ADVANCES TO FORT GEORGE--HIS OFFICERS AND ARMY PLUNDER THE\r\nINHABITANTS--RETREATS BACK TO CHIPPEWA--BURNS THE VILLAGE OF ST. DAVID'S\r\nON THE WAY.\r\n\r\nOn the Niagara frontier, the American army commanded by General Brown,\r\nand consisting of about 7,000 men, began early in the summer to\r\nconcentrate at Buffalo, Black Rock, and other points, and on the 3rd of\r\nJuly invaded Canada in two brigades, under the command of\r\nBrigadier-Generals Scott and Ripley. They embarked in boats and\r\nbatteaux, and effected a landing on the Canada side of the river without\r\nopposition--one brigade landing about a mile above, and the other\r\nbrigade a mile below Fort Erie. The fort was under the command of Major\r\nBuck, of the 8th Regiment, with about seventy men of his regiment; it\r\nhad been put in a state of defence by that officer, with a view of\r\ncausing a temporary check to an invading force, rather than for the\r\npurpose of defending it against a regular siege. But Major Buck was so\r\ncareful of himself and his men as to abandon the fort without firing a\r\nshot--an error fatal to the British--for although Fort Erie could not\r\nhave been held for any length of time against the overwhelming strength\r\nof the enemy, still a few hours' defence would have enabled General\r\nRiall to concentrate his forces and attack the Americans before they\r\nwere firmly established on Canadian soil. The able dispositions which\r\nGeneral Riall had made of the forces under his command along the\r\nNiagara line by the direction of General Drummond, who had anticipated\r\nan invasion at that point where it commenced, were such, that the least\r\nimpediment to the progress of the invaders would have enabled General\r\nRiall to have concentrated his troops, and to have fallen upon and\r\ndispersed the enemy before they could have time to be prepared for an\r\neffectual resistance. As it was, the Americans were permitted to occupy\r\nthis important post without resistance, and transfer, unmolested, to the\r\nCanadian side all the troops they pleased.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, General Brown advanced with his whole force, of\r\nover 4,000 men, down the river to the plains of Chippewa, with the\r\nintention of taking possession of the British post at the mouth of the\r\nChippewa or Welland river. General Riall, having collected what forces\r\nhe could, consisting of five companies of the Royal Scots, a part of the\r\n8th or King's Regiment, a part of the 100th Regiment, and the 2nd\r\nLincoln Militia, amounting in all to about 1,500 men, determined to\r\ncheck him, until further assistance should arrive. A series of\r\nmanoeuvres ensued on both sides, and the most furious battle hitherto\r\noccurring during the war, followed, when General Riall, finding himself\r\nno longer able to sustain the fight against a force so unequal in\r\nuniversal strength, gave orders to abandon the field--his troops\r\nretiring in the rear of the works at Chippewa and destroying the bridge\r\nacross the river, which they had previously repaired.\r\n\r\nThe loss on both sides is said to have been nearly equal--amounting to\r\nbetween 400 and 500 on each side.\r\n\r\n\"The 2nd Lincoln Militia, under Major David Secord, distinguished\r\nthemselves in this action by feats of genuine bravery and heroism,\r\nanimated by the example of their gallant leader, which are seldom\r\nsurpassed even by the most experienced veterans. Their loss was\r\nproportionate with that of the regular army.\r\n\r\n\"Three or four days subsequent to this sanguinary battle on the plains\r\nof Chippewa were mostly employed in burying their own dead, and in\r\nburning those of the British, after which several ineffectual efforts\r\nwere made by General Brown to cross the Chippewa river, contemplating an\r\nadvance on Fort George; but at each of his attempts he was promptly met\r\nby picket guards of the British, posted along the margin of the river\r\nfor that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Riall, however, in a few days gave orders that the remnant of\r\nhis army should retire under the shelter of Fort George and Mississagua\r\nuntil reinforcements could be collected to place him on more equal\r\nground with the enemy; after which General Brown moved his army towards\r\nthose posts within a mile and a half of the British--his army forming a\r\ncrescent; his right resting on Niagara river, his left on Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe American army had no sooner taken up a position in front of Fort\r\nGeorge than their foraging parties, or rather marauders, commenced a\r\nsystematic course of plunder upon the defenceless inhabitants within the\r\nvicinity of their camp, most of whom, at the time, consisted of women\r\nand children. Even amongst general officers were acts of pillage\r\nperpetrated, that, had such occurred with private soldiers in the\r\nBritish army, would have stamped on the character of the British, in the\r\neyes of America, for which no course of conduct which they could ever\r\nafter have pursued, would have sufficiently atoned.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval in which General Riall was receiving reinforcements\r\nfrom York and other military posts on that side of Lake Ontario, General\r\nBrown also received a strong reinforcement under General Izard, after\r\nwhich he made a few ineffectual assaults on Fort George; but, finding\r\nall his efforts to carry that fort fruitless, and the British army\r\nreceiving fresh acquisitions of strength, all seemed to conspire to\r\nrender the case of General Brown hopeless; who, now perceiving the\r\nsituation in which he was placed--the forts in his front to him\r\ncompletely impregnable, and an army in his rear in full flow of spirits,\r\nand every day gathering new strength (though by no means equal to his as\r\nregarded numbers), a Canadian Militia, and unexpectedly to him, fervent\r\nbeyond a parallel in the cause of their King and country--began now to\r\nthink of a safe retreat, in pursuance of which, on the morning of the\r\n25th of July, he commenced his retrograde movement; he retreated towards\r\nChippewa, after burning the village of St. David's. Riall pushed on in\r\npursuit, when the Americans halted at Lundy's Lane (called Bridgewater\r\nby the Americans), where took place the most stubborn fight of the\r\nwar--known as _the Battle of Lundy's Lane_--which may be regarded as\r\nterminating the American invasions of Canada, and the last field battle\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nWe will here give a brief account of this celebrated battle, from\r\nThompson's History of the War of 1812, and the events which followed at\r\nFort Erie, and afterwards we will review the transactions of this\r\nbattle, together with the true principles of loyalty, the causes and\r\ncharacter of the war, and the reciprocal relations between Great\r\nBritain, Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF LUNDY'S LANE--PRELIMINARIES.\r\n\r\n\"The British army, at the time General Brown commenced his retreat from\r\nFort George and Queenston to Chippewa, was scattered in small\r\ncantonments over twenty or thirty miles of country; but like a\r\nwell-ordered and systematic machine, every part was in a moment\r\nsimultaneously in motion, to concentrate their united strength at a\r\npoint where they would be likely to intercept the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Detachments of the Royal Scots and 41st Regiments, and a small body of\r\nIndians, amounting in all to about 500 men, under the command of Colonel\r\nTucker (supported on the river by a party of seamen and marines under\r\nthe direction of Captain Dobbs, of the Royal Navy), passed over to the\r\nAmerican side of the River Niagara, with a view to disperse or capture a\r\nbody of the enemy stationed at Lewiston. The object of this movement\r\nbeing accomplished, the troops were again withdrawn at Queenston. The\r\n41st and 100th Regiments, under Colonel Tucker, were sent back to\r\ngarrison Fort George, Mississagua, and Niagara; General Drummond moving\r\non towards the falls, with a force of about 800 strong, consisting of\r\ndetachments of the Royal Scots, 89th, and King's, with the light company\r\nof the 41st Regiment, to join General Riall's division of the army as\r\nsoon as it could arrive from the several bivouacs at which it had been\r\nstationed.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the column of the British army under the command of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Morrison had arrived at the rising ground near the\r\nend of Lundy's Lane, on the main road leading from Queenston to\r\nChippewa, the enemy was just taking possession of that position. Without\r\na moment's delay, the troops which had arrived on the ground were formed\r\nin line on the north-east side of the height, their left resting on the\r\nQueenston road.\r\n\r\n\"The troops from the Twelve and Twenty Mile Creeks, together with a\r\ndetachment of the King's Regiment, as they arrived, were formed on each\r\nside of Lundy's Lane. This line was supported in front by two\r\ntwenty-four-pounders [field-guns], which were covered by a small\r\nsquadron of the 19th Light Dragoons and a detachment of the infantry.\r\n\r\n\"_The battle itself._--The troops of the line being thus disposed,\r\nnotwithstanding the superior strength of the enemy, in about ten minutes\r\ndislodged him from the position he had first taken, at the point of the\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\n\"The sun was now fast descending towards the western horizon; and\r\ndetachments of the 1st and 2nd Lincoln Militia continued to arrive from\r\nthe different outposts they had been occupying, who joined in\r\nmaintaining the summit of the hill until the whole of General Riall's\r\ndivision should come up.\r\n\r\n\"General Drummond, after dislodging the enemy from the partial\r\npossession he had gained on the hill, again formed his line with as much\r\ndespatch as existing circumstances would admit, placing his artillery,\r\nwhich consisted of two twenty-pounders, two six-pounders [brass\r\nfield-pieces], and a rocket party, in front of the centre of his\r\nposition, near the right side of Lundy's Lane, leading down the hill to\r\nthe Queenston road, supported by the 2nd battalion of the 89th Regiment,\r\nunder Colonel Morrison. Scarcely had this arrangement been completed\r\nbefore the position was furiously assailed by General Winfield Scott's\r\nbrigade at the point of the bayonet; but the enemy was repulsed with\r\ngreat slaughter. A tremendous fire was then commenced on the crest of\r\nthe British position, by the first brigade of the enemy, stationed near\r\nthe copse between Lundy's Lane and the Falls of Niagara, and the 9th and\r\n22nd Regiments and Captain Lawson's brigade of artillery, stationed on\r\nthe Queenston road.\r\n\r\n\"During this stage of the engagement, the Light Company of Royal Scots\r\narrived on the ground from the Twenty Mile Creek; and a courier was\r\ndespatched to countermand the route of the 103rd Regiment, and the\r\ndetachment of the King's and 104th Regiments, who had, in a mistake,\r\ntaken the road to Queenston from the Beach Woods, and to hasten their\r\nmovement to the field of action.\r\n\r\n\"On the brow of the hill, at the east end of Lundy's Lane, for the\r\npossession of which the armies hitherto had principally contended,\r\nGeneral Drummond had now planted his artillery, as it appeared to form\r\nthe key to the position. On this quarter, therefore, the enemy for a\r\nlength of time directed his whole efforts; and notwithstanding the\r\ncarnage was truly appalling, no visible impression had yet been made.\r\nStill on this part of the field did the whirlwind of the conflict rage\r\nwith awful and destructive fury; columns of the enemy, not unlike the\r\nundulating surge of the adjacent cataract, rushed to the charge in close\r\nand impetuous succession.\r\n\r\n\"In this fearful and tremendous stage of the contest, the British\r\nforces, both regulars and militia, finding themselves pressed by an\r\noverwhelming force, simultaneously closed round the guns, apparently\r\ndetermined to contest their possession with the last drop of British\r\nblood on the ground, fully assured of their importance to a favourable\r\ntermination of the engagement--in short both armies appeared to be\r\nroused to a state of desperation for victory.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy at length succeeded to make a slight turn on the left of the\r\nBritish position; at which period, General Riall, who commanded that\r\ndivision of the army, was severely wounded in the arm, and having passed\r\nto the rear for the purpose of having his wound dressed, on his return\r\nto resume the command, was intercepted by a column of the enemy and made\r\nprisoner of war.\r\n\r\n\"It was long before this crisis of the engagement that the curtain of\r\nnight had enveloped the scene; but instead of this circumstance abating\r\nthe fury of war, which had now completely drenched the field with the\r\nblood of the combatants, the rage of battle appeared only to increase as\r\nthe night advanced. Still did the enemy continue to direct his strongest\r\nforce against the crest of the British position; but his repeated\r\ncharges were as often received and repelled by the regular, fencible,\r\nand militia forces engaged, with that intrepid gallantry for which the\r\nBritish army was ever characterized. Charges were made in such rapid\r\nsuccession and with such determined vigour that often were the British\r\nartillerymen assailed in the very act of springing and charging their\r\nguns; and often were the muzzles of the guns of the contending armies\r\nhauled up and levelled within a few yards of each other. The havoc of\r\nlives on both sides, under such circumstances, may be better conceived\r\nthan described.\r\n\r\n\"The battle having raged with almost unprecedented fury for upwards of\r\nthree hours, both sides appeared for a time mutually to suspend\r\nhostilities; during which the British troops were supplied with fresh\r\nammunition, and the enemy employed himself actively in bringing up his\r\nreserve columns; after which, the fire was recommenced from the\r\nQueenston road, on the left of the British column; however, it was\r\ndiscovered that this was only a diversion to mask the intention of a\r\nlarge body of the enemy's fresh troops, which was actually moving on the\r\nright of the British position, to outflank it. General Drummond\r\ncommenced immediately to draw his strength towards this flank of the\r\narmy, forming a line in a field of grain, upon which the enemy were seen\r\nto advance in slow and silent pace. The British line formed to repel\r\nthis new attack was directed to kneel sufficiently low to prevent being\r\nperceived by the enemy; but scarcely had General Drummond completed this\r\norder of arrangement, before the enemy's column made its appearance and\r\nadvanced within a few yards of the British line, when the signal was\r\nmade to fire a volley and charge. The effect of that single fire upon\r\nthe enemy's ranks was awful in the extreme--those of the enemy who were\r\nable made a precipitate retreat.\r\n\r\n\"'The enemy's efforts to carry the hill,' says General Drummond, in his\r\nofficial report, 'were continued until midnight, when he had suffered so\r\nseverely from the superior steadiness and discipline of his Majesty's\r\ntroops, that he gave up the contest and retreated with great\r\nprecipitation to his camp beyond the Chippewa, burning, as he passed the\r\n(Street) flour mills at Bridgewater. On the following day he abandoned\r\nhis camp, threw the greatest part of his baggage, camp equipage, and\r\nprovisions into the rapids above the falls; and destroying the bridge\r\nat Chippewa, he continued his retreat in great disorder towards Fort\r\nErie.\r\n\r\n\"'The loss sustained by the enemy,' adds General Drummond, 'in this\r\nsevere action, cannot be estimated at less than 1,500 men, including\r\nseveral prisoners left in our hands. Generals Brown and Scott were among\r\nthe wounded. His whole force, which was never rated at less than 5,000\r\nmen, were all engaged.'\r\n\r\n\"In General Drummond's report of this action, the total number of\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing of the British army was 878.\r\n\r\n\"By the regimental returns of the British army, including those of the\r\nmilitia, both before and after this engagement, the whole British force\r\nconsisted of 2,800; but before the arrival of the troops under Colonel\r\nScott, of the 103rd Regiment, it did not exceed 1,600.\r\n\r\n\"Of all the battles (says a writer on this subject) fought in America,\r\nthe action of Lundy's Lane was unquestionably the best sustained and by\r\nfar the most sanguinary. The rapid charges and real contest with the\r\nbayonet were themselves sufficient to render this engagement\r\nconspicuous. Traits of real bravery and heroic devotion were that night\r\ndisplayed by those engaged, which would not suffer in comparison with\r\nthose exhibited at the storming of St. Sebastian, or the conflict of\r\nQuatre Bras.\r\n\r\n\"Both the belligerent armies have offered their claims for victory in\r\nthis engagement. Upon what grounds the American general could propose\r\nsuch a claim are best known to himself--General Brown not only abandoned\r\nthe plans of operations which he had formed previous to the action at\r\nLundy's Lane [of advancing to Queenston, Fort George, and Burlington\r\nHeights], but 'retreated in great disorder towards Fort Erie,' where his\r\negress from the territory might be more easy; and in his way destroyed\r\nthe bridge at Chippewa, in order to retard the advance of the British\r\nlight troops in his rear.\"[221]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN ARMY RETREATS TO FORT ERIE, PURSUED BY GENERAL DRUMMOND, WHO\r\nINVESTS THE FORT--UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO STORM IT--SORTIE OF THE WHOLE\r\nAMERICAN FORCE, TWICE THAT OF GENERAL DRUMMOND, BUT DEFEATED--RAIN\r\nCOMPELS THE RAISING OF THE SIEGE--GENERAL BROWN EVACUATES THE FORT AND\r\nCROSSES THE RIVER TO THE AMERICAN SIDE, AND THIS ENDS THE THREE YEARS'\r\nINVASIONS OF CANADA, WITHOUT ACQUIRING AN INCH OF ITS TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nOn the American army reaching Fort Erie, they entrenched and\r\nstrengthened the fortifications of the fort. Thither General Drummond\r\npursued, and immediately invested the fort, although his army was not\r\nhalf the strength of the American army. General Drummond having\r\nreconnoitred the enemy's position, determined to storm his\r\nentrenchments. On the 13th of August, General Drummond, having completed\r\nhis batteries, commenced a brisk cannonade on the position of the enemy,\r\nwhich, with few interruptions, was continued for two days with great\r\neffect; after which he was determined to carry the fort and outworks by\r\nnocturnal assault. In pursuance of this purpose, he formed his troops\r\ninto three divisions: the first, under Lieutenant-Colonel Fischer, of De\r\nWatteville's, consisting of the King's Regiment, the regiment of De\r\nWatteville, and flank companies of the 89th and 100th Regiments,\r\ndirected against the enemy's entrenchments at and near Snake Hill; the\r\nsecond, under Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond, of the 104th Regiment,\r\nconsisting of the 41st and 104th Regiments, and a body of seamen and\r\nmarines under the direction of Captain Dobbs, of the Royal Navy, against\r\nthe fort; and the third, under Colonel Scott, consisting of his own\r\nregiment, supported by two companies of the Royals, against the\r\nentrenchments adjoining the fort.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock on the morning of the 15th, the several divisions of\r\nthe British army moved towards the enemy's entrenchments; but as soon as\r\nthe column against Snake Hill had emerged from the woods, it came in\r\ncontact with an abatis within twelve or fifteen yards of the enemy's\r\nentrenchments, defended by a heavy column of infantry, under the command\r\nof Major Wood, and the artillery under Captain Towson. This for a time\r\ncompletely checked his advance.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was soon announced by a tremendous fire from the guns in the\r\nfort, and from the columns of infantry defending the entrenchments near\r\nthe shore of the lake, that the other two columns, under\r\nLieutenant-Colonels Scott and Drummond, had commenced an assault upon\r\nthe enemy's works.\r\n\r\nAt the first outset of the two last columns, the enemy succeeded in\r\nturning the column on the left, under Colonel Scott; but that under\r\nColonel Drummond penetrated the enemy's works and charged through his\r\nranks with such irresistible impetuosity that nothing seemed\r\nsufficiently impregnable to arrest its progress. Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nScott in the meantime rallied his column, which had been partially\r\nturned on one flank, and the fort was assailed in almost every quarter\r\nby the besiegers; an escalade was effected, the enemy driven from the\r\nramparts at the point of the bayonet, and the guns of the fort turned\r\nupon the garrison; all of which preludes to victory had actually been\r\ngained a few minutes after the first alarm.\r\n\r\nThe battle raged with a fury seldom equalled. The British troops, in\r\npursuance of an order to that effect, having previously divested their\r\nmuskets of the flints, every foot of ground was contested at the point\r\nof the bayonet, which rendered the carnage more dreadful and appalling.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Drummond (brother of General Drummond), during the\r\nconflict within the fort, performed extraordinary acts of valour. In the\r\nhottest of the battle he presented himself, encouraging his men, both by\r\nexample and precept. But at the very moment when victory was declaring\r\nin favour of the British arms, some ammunition which had been placed\r\nunder the platform ignited, and a dreadful explosion was the result, by\r\nwhich the greater part of the British forces, which had entered the\r\nfort, were literally blown into the air.[222] All exertions of the few\r\nBritish troops who survived the explosion were found ineffectual to\r\nmaintain their ground, in the panic of the moment, against such an\r\nunequal force as the enemy was enabled to bring up against them, and the\r\nBritish forces were compelled to retire.\r\n\r\nIn this assault the loss of the British was severe. Colonels Scott and\r\nDrummond fell, while storming the works, at the head of their respective\r\ncolumns. General Drummond reported the killed, wounded, and missing,\r\nofficers and men, as 904. The missing were reported at nine officers and\r\n530 men--afterwards ascertained to have been principally killed. The\r\nAmerican statement of their own loss made it 84 in killed, wounded, and\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nA day or two after this assault, General Drummond was reinforced by the\r\narrival of the 6th and 82nd Regiments from Lower Canada; but this\r\nreinforcement was barely sufficient to supply recent losses. He deemed\r\nit unadvisable to attempt a second storming of the fort against a force\r\ntwice as numerous as his own; but by continuing the investment, he cut\r\noff all communication of the enemy with the surrounding country, cooped\r\nhim up in the fort, compelled him to draw his provisions and other\r\nresources from his own country, and thus rendered his occupation of that\r\nfort for the remainder of the campaign of no service to the invaders.\r\n\r\nAt about the expiration of a month, General Brown, having recovered of\r\nhis wounds, again resumed command of the army on the Niagara frontier,\r\nand brought with him a strong reinforcement, resolving to attempt the\r\ndestruction of the British batteries in front of Fort Erie. Pursuant to\r\nthis determination, General Brown, on the 17th of September, at about\r\nnoon, ordered a sortie of the whole American force, including both\r\nregulars and militia, in three divisions, under Generals Porter, Miller,\r\nand Ripley; and before the ready and reserved columns of the British\r\ncould be brought from the camp (about a mile in the rear), the enemy had\r\nsucceeded in penetrating the batteries, destroying the works with one\r\nmagazine of ammunition, and spiking the guns. But ere he could effect\r\nhis retreat, the ready and reserve columns arrived, and immediately\r\ncommenced a determined attack upon his columns, and after about half an\r\nhour's desperate fighting, notwithstanding his great superiority of\r\nnumbers, he retired before the bayonets of the British line, in great\r\nprecipitation, under the cover of his works, after losing nearly 600 of\r\nhis force.\r\n\r\nThe incessant rains which had fallen that season rendered it impossible\r\nfor General Drummond to repair his batteries, or, indeed, to keep the\r\nfield, on account of the exposure and increased sickness of the troops;\r\nhe therefore, on the 21st of September, raised the siege and retired\r\ninto winter quarters, in rear of his works at the mouth of the Chippewa.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown affected some inclination to follow on the rear of the\r\nBritish army; yet, notwithstanding all the efforts which could possibly\r\nbe exercised by a general were called into contribution by General\r\nDrummond to bring General Brown into action, it all proved unavailing.\r\nThe American general, \"as soon as the coast was clear,\" having blown up\r\nthe works, evacuated Fort Erie, and retreated across the river into his\r\nown country.\r\n\r\nThus terminated the campaign of 1814 on the Niagara frontier; and\r\nwhatever might have been the object of the American Government when they\r\nsent that last army to invade Canada, it is certain that nothing was\r\nacquired, if we except a fresh proof (if such had been now necessary) of\r\nthe loyalty of the Canadian people to their Sovereign, and their\r\nunshaken zeal to defend their country from the grip of its enemy, at\r\nwhatever time he might think proper to invade it.[223]\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nREVIEW.\r\n\r\nThe author cannot better present a summary review of the true principles\r\nof loyalty, the origin, causes, characteristics, and results of the war\r\nof 1812-15, together with the conduct of the inhabitants of Canada in\r\nrespect to it, than in the words of an address which he delivered to the\r\nYork Pioneers at Queenston, in July, 1875, on the occasion of the\r\nanniversary celebration of the battle of Lundy's Lane. The address\r\n(which was entirely extemporaneous in the delivery) is here reproduced,\r\nas reported in the newspapers at the time:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CAUSES OF THE WAR DECLARED BY THE UNITED STATES AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN,\r\nJUNE 18, 1812--CANADIAN DEFENCE--BATTLE OF LUNDY'S LANE, FOUGHT JULY 25,\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n\"Address delivered by the Rev. Dr. Ryerson before the York Pioneers and\r\nother Associations assembled on Queenston Heights, near Brock's\r\nMonument, met at a pic-nic on Monday, July 26th, 1875, to celebrate the\r\nbattle of Lundy's Lane.\r\n\r\n\"The Chairman, Colonel R. Denison, called upon Dr. Ryerson, who was\r\nwarmly received.\r\n\r\n\"After a few preliminary observations, he said that he felt it a great\r\nprivilege to be called on to address a number of those Canadians who had\r\nlaid the foundation of our country, who had given Canada a name that was\r\nhonoured throughout the world, and whose hearts beat responsive to those\r\nnoble principles that made England the glory of all nations, and British\r\ninstitutions the honour of mankind. (Loud applause.) He thought the York\r\nPioneers might well be called the Canadian Pioneers--the pioneers of\r\nCanadian industry enterprise, freedom, and civilization. The object of\r\nthe Society in giving an intelligent intensity to those principles that\r\nconstituted the loyalty of the people of Canada, in preserving the\r\ntraditions of the country, and in uniting in one centre the various\r\nelements of scattered light which were connected with the earliest rays\r\nof its opening history, were works well worthy of the defenders of the\r\nliberties of this country. The very foundation of the York Pioneers was\r\na spirit of loyalty. What was that loyalty itself? It was no other than\r\nan attachment to the institutions and laws of the land in which we live,\r\nand to the history of the nation to which we belong. It was not merely a\r\nsentiment of respect of the country to an individual, or even to the\r\nSovereign. If it gathered round the person of the Sovereign, it was\r\nbecause that Sovereign represented the institutions of the people, the\r\novershadowing laws of the people, the real and essential freedom, and\r\nthe noblest development of the spirit of the people. Loyalty in its true\r\nessence and meaning was the principle of respect to our Sovereign, the\r\nfreedom of our institutions, and the excellencies of our civilization,\r\nand it was therefore a feeling worthy to be perpetuated by the people.\r\nShakespeare--that great apostle of human nature--has said:\r\n\r\n\"'Though _loyalty_, well held, to fools does make\r\nOur faith mere folly; yet he that can endure\r\nTo follow with allegiance a fallen lord,\r\nDoes conquer him that did his master conquer.'\r\n\r\n\"Loyalty is, therefore, faithful to its own principles, whether the\r\npersonal object of it is in prosperity or adversity.\r\n\r\n\"'Loyalty is still the same,\r\nWhether it win or lose the game;\r\nTrue as the dial to the sun,\r\nThough it be not shone upon.'\r\n\r\n\"Hence, says Lord Clarendon, of a statesman of his time, 'He had no\r\nveneration for the Court, but only such loyalty to the King as the law\r\nrequired.' True loyalty is, therefore, fidelity to the Constitution,\r\nlaws, and institutions of the land, and, of course, to the sovereign\r\npower representing them.\r\n\r\n\"Thus was it with our Loyalist forefathers. There was no class of\r\ninhabitants of the old British-American Colonies more decided and\r\nearnest than they in claiming the rights of British subjects when\r\ninvaded; yet when, instead of maintaining the rights of British\r\nsubjects, it was proposed to renounce the allegiance of British subjects\r\nand destroy the unity of the empire, or 'the life of the nation' (as our\r\nAmerican neighbours expressed it, in their recent civil war to maintain\r\nthe unity of their republic), then were our forefathers true to their\r\nloyalty, and adhered to the unity of the empire at the sacrifice of\r\nproperty and home, and often of life itself. Of them might be said, what\r\nMilton says of Abdiel, amid the revolting hosts:\r\n\r\n\"'Abdiel, faithful found;\r\nUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\r\nHis loyalty he kept.'\r\n\r\n\"Our United Empire Loyalist forefathers 'kept their loyalty unshaken,\r\nunseduced, unterrified,' during seven long years of conflicts and\r\nsufferings; and that loyalty, with a courage and enterprise, and under\r\nprivations and toils unsurpassed in human history, sought a refuge and\r\na home in the wilderness of Canada, felled the forests of our country,\r\nand laid the foundation of its institutions, freedom, and prosperity.\r\n(Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\"Canadian loyalty is the perpetuation of that British national life\r\nwhich has constituted the strength and glory of Great Britain since the\r\nmorning of the Protestant Reformation, and placed her at the head of the\r\nfreedom and civilization of mankind. This loyalty maintains the\r\ncharacteristic traditions of the nation--the mysterious links of\r\nconnection between grandfather and grandson--traditions of strength and\r\nglory for a people, and the violations of which are a source of weakness\r\nand disorganization. Canadian loyalty, therefore, is not a mere\r\nsentiment, or mere affection for the representative or person of the\r\nSovereign; it is a reverence for, and attachment to, the laws, order,\r\ninstitutions and freedom of the country. As Christianity is not a mere\r\nattachment to a bishop, or ecclesiastic, or form of church polity, but a\r\ndeep love of divine truth; so Canadian loyalty is a firm attachment to\r\nthat British Constitution and those British laws, adopted or enacted by\r\nourselves, which best secure life, liberty, and prosperity, and which\r\nprompt us to Christian and patriotic deeds by linking us with all that\r\nis grand and noble in the traditions of our national history.\r\n\r\n\"In the war of 1812 to 1815--one of the last and hardest-fought battles\r\nwas that of Lundy's Lane, which we meet this day, on this historic\r\nground, to celebrate--both the loyalty and courage of the Canadian\r\npeople were put to the severest test, and both came out of the fiery\r\nordeal as refined gold. Nothing could be more disgraceful and\r\nunprincipled than the Madison (I will not say American) declaration of\r\nwar against Great Britain, which was at that moment employing her utmost\r\nstrength and resources in defence of European nations and the liberties\r\nof mankind. That scourge of modern Europe--the heartless tyrant, but\r\ngreat soldier, Napoleon--had laid prostrate at his feet all the\r\nGovernments of Western and Central Europe, England alone excepted. To\r\ndestroy British power, he issued decrees first at Berlin, in 1806, and\r\nafterwards at Milan, excluding all British merchandize from French\r\nports, and prohibiting the use of British commodities throughout France\r\nand her dependencies, under severe penalties; searching neutral vessels\r\nfor British goods, and confiscating them when found, with the vessels\r\ncarrying them; interdicting all neutral vessels from trading with any\r\nBritish port; declaring all the ports of Great Britain and of her\r\ndependencies to be in a state of blockade, though at the very moment the\r\nEnglish fleet commanded the seas. These Napoleon decrees violated the\r\nlaws of nations, and affected the national rights and independence of\r\nthe United States, as well as of the European nations; and had not\r\nPresident Madison and his war faction been in league with Napoleon, they\r\nwould have resented it, instead of silently submitting, and thus\r\nbecoming a party to it. In self-defence and retaliation upon the tyrant\r\nNapoleon, Great Britain, in January, 1807, issued Decrees of Council,\r\ndeclaring all French ports in a state of blockade, and declaring all\r\nvessels of neutrals liable to seizure which should engage in trade with\r\nFrance; and as the Napoleon decrees had declared all vessels of any\r\nnation liable to seizure which had touched at any British port, the\r\nEnglish Orders of Council, to counteract this decree, declared, on the\r\nother hand, that only such ships as had touched at a British port should\r\nbe permitted to sail for a port of France. The American President,\r\nMadison, being in league with the French usurper against Great Britain,\r\nmade no remonstrance against the Napoleon decrees of Berlin and Milan,\r\nbut raised a great outcry against the counter English Orders in Council,\r\nand made them a pretext for declaring war against Great Britain. But\r\nPresident Madison not only thus leagued with Napoleon to destroy British\r\ncommerce, but also to weaken the British army and navy by seducing some\r\n10,000 British sailors and soldiers to desert on board of American\r\nvessels, where they were claimed as American citizen sailors.\r\n\r\n\"England had always claimed the right to search and claim her deserting\r\nsailors on board foreign vessels, and that right had never been disputed\r\nby the United States, until now, under the teachings of Napoleon. But\r\nthough there was no occasion for the exercise of such a right in a time\r\nof general peace, the exercise of it then was a matter vital to the\r\nexistence and strength of the British navy; but, under the promptings of\r\nNapoleon, President Madison made it not only a subject of loud\r\ncomplaint, but also an additional pretext for war. Yet, to keep up some\r\nappearance of fairness, but in secret intrigue with Napoleon, the\r\nMadison Administration issued a declaration to open commercial relations\r\nwith either of the belligerent powers that should first rescind the\r\nprohibitory decrees or orders. In May, 1812, Napoleon rescinded the\r\nBerlin and Milan decrees so far as concerned the United States, but had\r\nthe unparalleled meanness to antedate them _thirteen_ months, and even\r\napply them to 1810, dating them April, 1811, in order to play into the\r\nhands of his American confederates. Within a month after Napoleon had\r\nrescinded the Berlin and Milan decrees--June 23rd, 1812--the British\r\nGovernment cancelled the Orders in Council so far as related to the\r\nUnited States; but five days before that, the 18th of June, President\r\nMadison declared war against Britain, and then when, six weeks\r\nafterwards, he was duly informed of the cancelling of these Orders in\r\nCouncil, on which he had professed to declare war, he refused to ratify\r\nan armistice agreed upon between Sir George Prevost and General\r\nDearborn, until the British and American Governments could confer with a\r\nview to prevent any further prosecution of the war. Madison and his\r\nfaction of British haters and war adventurers naturally supposed, that\r\nas Upper Canada consisted of 70,000 inhabitants, and as the British\r\ntroops were all engaged in the deadly war with France, except guards of\r\nregular soldiers in the Canadian garrisons, our country would fall an\r\neasy prey to his ambition; Great Britain would be humbled at the feet of\r\nNapoleon, and France and the United States would then divide the power\r\nand commerce of Europe and America. But British and Canadian loyalty,\r\npatriotism, and courage defeated their dark designs against the\r\nliberties of mankind. Even the patriotic and intellectual part of the\r\nAmerican people denounced this unholy intrigue between their own\r\nPresident and the bloody ursurper of Europe, and this causeless war\r\nagainst Great Britain. The Legislative Assemblies of Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Maryland condemned the war\r\npolicy of President Madison, and some of them declared it to be but a\r\nparty proceeding of the President and his minions to keep themselves in\r\npower and subsidize their hungry partizans. Only a small majority of\r\nCongress approved the declaration of war. A convention of the great\r\nState of New York, held at Albany, September, 1812, consisting of\r\ndelegates from the several counties of the State, embodied, in\r\nelaborate resolutions, the intelligent American sentiment on the subject\r\nof the war. That convention declared: 'That, without insisting on the\r\ninjustice of the present war, taking solely into consideration the time\r\nand circumstances of its declaration, the condition of the country, and\r\nthe state of the public mind, we are constrained to consider and feel it\r\nour duty to pronounce it a most rash, unwise and inexpedient measure,\r\nthe adoption of which ought forever to deprive its authors of the esteem\r\nand confidence of an enlightened people; because, as the injuries we\r\nhave received from France are at least equal in amount to those we have\r\nsustained from England, and have been attended with circumstances of\r\nstill greater insult and aggravation; if war were necessary to vindicate\r\nthe honour of the country, consistency and impartiality required that\r\nboth nations should have been included in the declaration; because, if\r\nit were deemed expedient to exercise our right of selecting our\r\nadversary, prudence and common sense dictated the choice of an enemy\r\nfrom whose hostility we had nothing to dread. A war with France would\r\nequally have satisfied our insulted honour, and, at the same time,\r\ninstead of annihilating, would have revived and extended our commerce;\r\nand even the evils of such a contest would have been mitigated by the\r\nsublime consolation, that by our efforts we were contributing to arrest\r\nthe progress of despotism in Europe, and effectually serving the great\r\ninterests of freedom and humanity throughout the world.' 'That we\r\ncontemplate with abhorrence, even the probability of an alliance with\r\nthe present Emperor of France, every action of whose life has\r\ndemonstrated, that the attainment, by any means, of universal empire,\r\nand the consequent extinction of every vestige of freedom, are the sole\r\nobjects of his incessant, unbounded and remorseless ambition.' 'Whereas\r\nthe late revocation of the British Orders in Council has removed the\r\ngreat and ostensible cause of the present war, and prepared the way for\r\nan immediate accommodation of all existing differences, inasmuch as, by\r\nthe confession of the present Secretary of State, satisfactory and\r\nhonourable arrangements might easily be made, by which the abuse\r\nresulting from the impressment of our seamen might, in future, be\r\neffectually prevented.'\r\n\r\n\"Such were the sentiments of the most intelligent and patriotic\r\nAmerican citizens in regard to the war of 1812-15; they had no more\r\nsympathy with the Madison-Napoleon war than with the recent Fenian\r\ninvasion of our shores. And when the war was declared, our fathers knew\r\ntheir duty, and knew the worthlessness of the pompous proclamations and\r\npromises of President Madison's generals and agents. The blood of our\r\nUnited Empire Loyalist forefathers warmed again in their own bosoms, and\r\npulsated in the hearts of their sons and grandsons, and in the hearts of\r\nhundreds of others who had adopted Canada, under the flag of British law\r\nand liberty, as their home. Our Legislative Assembly--specially called\r\ntogether by General Brock, on the declaration of war--struck the keynote\r\nfor Canadian loyalty, sacrifice and action, in a calm, expository and\r\nearnest address to the people of Upper Canada, and truly represented the\r\nalready roused spirit of the country. Some of the words of that noble\r\naddress are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'This war, on the part of the United States, includes an alliance with\r\nthe French usurper, whose dreadful policy has destroyed all that is\r\ngreat and grand, venerable and holy, on the continent of Europe. The\r\ngovernment of this bloody tyrant penetrates into everything--it crushes\r\nindividuals as well as nations, fetters thoughts as well as motives, and\r\ndelights in destroying forever all that is fair and just in opinion and\r\nsentiment. It is evidently this tyrant who now directs the rulers of\r\nAmerica, and they show themselves worthy disciples of such a master.'\r\n\r\n\"After noting the juncture selected for declaring war, the address\r\nproceeds: 'It is certainly not the least wonderful among the occurrences\r\nof this astonishing age, that we should find a nation descended from\r\nEnglishmen, connected still by the same language and laws, by\r\nconsanguinity and many similar habits, not merely eulogizing the\r\nimplacable enemy of their parent state, but joining him in the war;\r\nwhile pretending to nourish the purest principles of liberty, bowing the\r\nknee before the foe of all just and rational freedom, and supplicating\r\nhis acceptance of tribute and adulation.' After sketching the origin and\r\nsustained loyalty of the first inhabitants of the country, the Assembly\r\nsaid: 'Already have we the joy to remark, that the spirit of loyalty has\r\nburst forth in all its ancient splendour. The militia in all parts of\r\nthe Province have volunteered their services with acclamation, and\r\ndisplayed a degree of energy worthy of the British name. When men are\r\ncalled upon to defend everything they hold precious, their wives and\r\nchildren, their friends and possessions, they ought to be inspired with\r\nthe noblest resolutions, and they will not be easily frightened by\r\nmenaces, or conquered by force. And beholding, as we do, the flame of\r\npatriotism burning from end to end of the Canadas, we cannot but\r\nentertain the most pleasing anticipations. Our enemies have indeed said,\r\nthat they can subdue this country by a proclamation; but it is our part\r\nto prove that they are sadly mistaken.' 'If the real foundations of true\r\nliberty, and consequently of solid happiness, consist in being amenable\r\nonly to such laws as we or our representatives ordain, then are we in\r\npossession of that liberty and that happiness, for this principle was\r\nfully recognized in our excellent constitution.' 'It is not necessary\r\nfor us to examine the causes alleged by our enemies for this unjust and\r\nunnatural war, because an address from the House of Representatives of\r\nMassachusetts, the most respectable in the Union, proves in the most\r\nsatisfactory manner, that it is wanton and unprovoked, and is the climax\r\nof the various outrages previously committed against Great Britain. In\r\nthis statement they have been joined by the minority in Congress, whose\r\nexpositions of the secret reasons of the war, and the falsehood of those\r\nalleged by the President and his friends, is unanswerable, and must hand\r\ndown the promoters of this diabolical measure to the execration of\r\nposterity.' 'Your representatives finished their labours with placing in\r\nthe hands of His Honour the President (Sir Isaac Brock), all the public\r\nmoney they could collect, in order to contribute as much as possible to\r\nthe extraordinary expenses which the war renders necessary, and they\r\nhave the fullest confidence that it will be most faithfully applied.\r\nHaving thus endeavoured, to the best of their abilities, to provide for\r\nthe welfare and safety of the Province, your representatives take the\r\nliberty of reminding you that the best laws are useless without the\r\nzealous co-operation of the people. Unless you are prepared to endure\r\nthe greatest privations and to make the severest sacrifices, all that\r\nyour representatives have done will be of no avail. Be ready, then, at\r\nall times to rally round the Royal Standard, and let those who are not\r\ncalled into the service assist the families of those who are called into\r\nthe field.' 'Remember, when you go forth to the combat, that you fight\r\nnot for yourselves alone, but for the whole world. You are defeating the\r\nmost formidable conspiracy against the civilization of man that ever was\r\ncontrived; a conspiracy threatening a greater barbarism and misery than\r\nfollowed the downfall of the Roman Empire--that now you have an\r\nopportunity of proving your attachment to the parent State which\r\ncontends for the relief of the oppressed nations--the last pillar of\r\ntrue liberty, and the last refuge of oppressed humanity.'\r\n\r\n\"Such were the views and spirit with which the 70,000 people of Upper\r\nCanada, and their score of parliamentary representatives, engaged in the\r\nunequal struggle against myriads of invaders--relying simply upon their\r\nprinciples, their duty, and their God; and, in three months after the\r\ndeclaration of war, they had, with the aid of a few hundred regular\r\nsoldiers and noble officers, driven back three invading armies,\r\ncapturing Hull and the territory of Michigan, driving the invaders\r\ncommanded by General Van Rensellaer down Queenston Heights, taking\r\nhundreds of prisoners, driving 'proclamation' General Smyth, with his\r\n8,000, from the Canadian side of the Niagara river, near Fort Erie, so\r\nthat he had to run away and retire from the army to escape popular\r\nindignation and disgrace. It is not for me to dwell upon the incidents\r\nand progress of the war; raids were made into our country, many battles\r\nwere fought, and much property destroyed and much suffering inflicted;\r\nbut those raids were severely retaliated, and at the end of three years\r\nnot a foot of Canadian territory was in possession of the invader, while\r\nthe key of the North-west, Fort Mackinaw, was in the hands of the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\n\"Of all the battles fought during the war, the most sanguinary and\r\nobstinate was that of Lundy's Lane--the battle, the anniversary of which\r\nwe are this day assembled to commemorate--the battle fought the last few\r\nmonths of the war, the 25th of July, 1814. It was the most formidable\r\nand final effort of the American General Brown to get permanent footing\r\nin Canada. The smallest number of American soldiers engaged in the\r\nbattle, according to General Brown's report, was upwards of 5,000; and\r\nthe largest number of British soldiers and Canadian militia engaged,\r\naccording to the British General Drummond's report, was 2,800, although\r\nthe greater part of the battle was fought with a force not exceeding\r\n1,600. I shall not attempt to describe the order, or narrate the\r\nincidents of the battle; I will only say, that the high ground, near the\r\neast end of Lundy's Lane, was the centre of interest, and the position\r\ncontended for by both parties in deadly strife for several hours. In no\r\nbattle during the war did the Americans fight with such heroism and\r\nobstinacy; and in no battle was the courage, steadiness and perseverance\r\nof the British soldiers and Canadian volunteers put to so severe a test.\r\nThe enemy was drawn up in order of battle within 600 yards of the\r\ncoveted eminence, when General Drummond arrived on the ground, and he\r\nhad barely time to plant his artillery on the brow of the hill, when the\r\nenemy concentrated all his power and efforts to obtain the key of the\r\nbattle-field. An eye-witness says: 'Columns of the enemy, not unlike the\r\nsurge of the adjacent cataract, rushed to the charge in close and\r\nimpetuous succession.' The curtain of night soon enveloped the scene,\r\nnow drenched with blood; but the darkness seemed to intensify the fury\r\nof the combatants, and the rage of the battle increased as the night\r\nadvanced. An eye-witness truly observes, that 'nothing could have been\r\nmore awful than this midnight contest. The desperate charges of the\r\nenemy were succeeded by a dead silence, interrupted only by the groans\r\nof the dying, and the dull sounds of the stupendous Falls of Niagara,\r\nwhile the adverse lines were now and then dimly discerned through the\r\nmoonlight, by the dismal gleam of their arms. These anxious pauses were\r\nsucceeded by a blaze of musketry along the lines, and by a repetition of\r\nthe most desperate charges from the enemy, which the British received\r\nwith the most unshaken firmness.' General Drummond, in his official\r\nreport of the battle, says:--'In so determined a manner were these\r\nattacks directed against our guns, that our artillerymen were bayoneted\r\nby the enemy in the act of loading, and the muzzles of the enemy's guns\r\nwere advanced within a few yards of ours. The darkness of the night,\r\nduring this extraordinary conflict, occasioned several uncommon\r\nincidents; our troops having, for a moment, been pushed back, some of\r\nour guns remained for a few minutes in the enemy's hands; they were,\r\nhowever, not only quickly recovered, but the two pieces, a six-pounder\r\nand a five-and-a-half-inch howitzer, which the enemy had brought up,\r\nwere captured by us, together with several tumbrils. About nine o'clock\r\n(the action having commenced at six) there was a short intermission of\r\nfiring, during which it appears the enemy was employed in bringing up\r\nthe whole of his remaining force; and he shortly afterwards renewed the\r\nattack with fresh troops, but was everywhere repelled with equal\r\ngallantry and success. The enemy's efforts to carry the hill were\r\ncontinued until about midnight, when he had suffered so severely from\r\nthe superior steadiness and discipline of his Majesty's troops, that he\r\ngave up the contest, and retreated with great precipitation to his camp\r\nbeyond the Chippewa. On the following day he abandoned his camp, threw\r\nthe greatest part of his baggage, camp equipage and provisions into the\r\nRapids; and having set fire to Street's Mills, and destroyed the bridge\r\nat Chippewa, he continued his retreat in great disorder towards Fort\r\nErie.'\r\n\r\n\"In this bloody battle, the Canadian militia fought side by side with\r\nthe regular soldiers; and General Drummond said, 'the bravery of the\r\nmilitia on this occasion could not have been excelled by the most\r\nresolute veterans.'\r\n\r\n\"Such was the loyalty of our grandfathers and fathers, and such their\r\nself-devotion and courage in the darkest hour of our country's dangers\r\nand sufferings, and though few in number in comparison of their\r\ninvaders, they had\r\n\r\n\"'Hearts resolved and hands prepared\r\nThe blessings they enjoyed to guard.'\r\n\r\n\"There was doubtless as much true courage among the descendants of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland in the United States as in Canada; but the former\r\nfought for the oppressor of Europe, the latter fought for the freedom of\r\nEurope; the former fought to prostrate Great Britain in her death\r\nstruggle for the liberties of mankind, and to build up the United States\r\nupon her ruin, the latter fought in the glorious cause of the mother\r\ncountry, and to maintain our own unity with her; the former fought for\r\nthe conquest of Canada, the latter fought in her defence; the fire that\r\nkindled the military ardour of the former was the blown-up embers of old\r\nenmities against Great Britain, the gross misrepresentations of\r\nPresident Madison, the ambition of adventure, and the lust of booty--the\r\nfire that burned in the hearts of the latter, and animated them to\r\ndeeds of death or freedom, was the sacred love of hearth and home, the\r\npatriotic love of liberty, and that hallowed principle of loyalty to\r\ntruth, and law, and liberty combined, which have constituted the life,\r\nand development, and traditions, and strength, and unity, and glory of\r\nBritish institutions, and of the British nation, from the resurrection\r\nmorn of the Protestant Reformation to the present day. A great writer\r\nhas truly observed: 'The most inviolable attachment to the laws of our\r\ncountry is everywhere acknowledged a capital virtue;' and that virtue\r\nhas been nobly illustrated in the history of our United Empire Loyalist\r\nforefathers, and of their descendants in Canada, and it grows with the\r\ngrowth and increases with the strength of our country.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that loyalty, like Christianity itself, is an attachment to\r\nprinciples and duties emanating from them, irrespective of rulers or\r\nteachers; but if the qualities of our chief rulers were necessary to\r\ngive intensity to Canadian loyalty, those qualities we have in the\r\nhighest degree in our Sovereign and in her representative in Canada; for\r\nnever was a British Sovereign more worthy of our highest respect and\r\nwarmest affection than our glorious Queen Victoria--(loud cheers)--and\r\nnever was a British Sovereign more nobly represented in Canada than by\r\nthe patriotic, the learned, and the eloquent Lord Dufferin. (Loud\r\ncheers.) And at no period were we more free or prosperous than now. The\r\nfeelings of his (the speaker's) heart went far beyond anything that his\r\ntongue could express, and the language of his heart that day was, might\r\nloyalty ever be the characteristic trait of the people of Canada, might\r\nfreedom ever be our possession, and might we ever have cause and heart\r\nto say 'God save the Queen!'\" (Loud cheering.)\r\n\r\n_Note_ by the Author.--The Administration of President Madison, and his\r\nDeclaration of War against Great Britain, are dark spots in the\r\nbrilliant history of the United States of America, and the American\r\nnarratives of the war are rather fiction than history--compiled largely\r\nfrom letters of officers and soldiers, who, in writing to their friends,\r\nsought to magnify their own heroism, even when suffering disgraceful\r\ndefeats, and sometimes claiming victory when they were driven from the\r\nfield. The usual tales on these occasions were that the Canadian forces\r\nwere vastly superior in numbers and equipments, when it was known that\r\nthe American armies were ten to one in numbers to those of Canada, and\r\ntheir invading forces were declared, by themselves, to be irresistible\r\nin strength and equipments.\r\n\r\nThe American account of the battle of Lundy's Lane is an example, and is\r\nrepeated with exaggerations in the latest and most popular history of\r\nthe war, namely, Lossing's Pictorial Field Book of the War of 1812, page\r\n1084. Lossing says:\r\n\r\n\"The number of troops engaged in the battle of Niagara Falls was little\r\nover 7,000, the British having about 4,500, and the Americans a little\r\nless than 2,600.\" (p. 824.)\r\n\r\nThe very reverse of this was the fact, as quoted in the foregoing\r\nextract from the official report of General Drummond. When the American\r\ninvading army consisted of 10,000 men, it is absurd to suppose that all\r\nbut 2,600 would remain on the American side of the river, and the\r\nAmerican historian states that every available soldier on the British\r\nside of the river was engaged in the battle.\r\n\r\nLossing likewise claims the battle for the Americans \"because they drove\r\nthe enemy from the field and captured his cannon\" (p. 824). It is not\r\ntrue that the British were driven from the field at all; they were once\r\npushed back for a few minutes, and their cannon were for a few moments\r\nin the hands of the Americans, who, however, were forthwith driven back,\r\nthe cannon retaken, with two pieces left by the Americans. And how could\r\nthere possibly be any American victory, when Lossing himself admits that\r\nthe American army retired from the field during the night to Chippewa\r\n(p. 823), with the intention of returning next morning to bring off the\r\ncannon and other booty. Is it the characteristic of a victorious army to\r\nleave the conquered field and retire two miles from it? Lossing also\r\nadmits that the Americans did not return to the battle-field next\r\nmorning, but burnt the bridge which separated the British army from\r\nthem, and retreated up the Niagara river. Is this the conduct of a\r\nconquering army, to flee from the enemy whom he pretends to have\r\nconquered? Mr. Lossing's admissions of details contradict the pretence\r\nof American victory at Lundy's Lane, and prove American defeat.\r\n\r\nIt is by such fictions of victories where there were defeats,\r\ninterspersed with fictitious incidents of individual heroism, that\r\nAmerican vanity is fed, and American children taught in the schools what\r\nis purely apocryphal for history in regard to Great Britain and Canada.\r\n\r\nBut it is gratifying to observe a greatly improved feeling in the\r\neducated American mind towards Great Britain, and even the causes of the\r\nAmerican Revolution, which were magnified in the American Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and which have been exaggerated in every possible way in\r\nAmerican histories and Fourth of July orations, are very much modified\r\nin the productions of well-instructed and candid American writers and\r\npublic speakers. We observe on a late occasion in England, at the\r\nWesleyan Conference, Bishop Simpson, the Massillon of American pulpit\r\norators, said, \"The triumph of America was England's triumph. Their\r\nobject was the same, and they were engaged in the same work. There were\r\nmore Englishmen who would go to America, than Americans who would come\r\nto England (laughter), and while they in England had the wealth, the\r\npower, and the elements of usefulness, they were bound to use it in the\r\ninterests of religion.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion, the Rev. Dr. Curry, editor of the New York\r\n_Christian Advocate_, the most widely circulated religious paper in\r\nAmerica, uttered the following noble sentiments:\r\n\r\n\"He was proud,\" he said, \"of England (as the Fatherland of his), and, as\r\nhe had now gone up and down through that island, and had witnessed its\r\nsigns of substantial wealth, and of social order, he felt that both the\r\npublic institutions of the Government and the private virtues of the\r\npeople were of the most valuable. He did not wonder that Englishmen were\r\nwarmly attached to their own country, and he would say that were he not\r\nan American he should wish to be an Englishman. He rejoiced, too, that\r\nthere now exists the most cordial good feeling between the two\r\ncountries, and trusted that this would never be interrupted. They had\r\nvery many interests in common, and should stand together in support of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nOn the last Fourth of July, the Rev. Dr. Newman, pastor of President\r\nGrant, who has finished a tour of the world, having been appointed to\r\nexamine and report upon all the American Consulships of the globe,\r\ndelivered a remarkable discourse on the progress of the nation, and also\r\nof the enlightened ideas and liberal institutions in Europe. In an\r\nallusion to the American Revolution, Dr. Newman says:\r\n\r\n\"Our forefathers were not slaves; they were English subjects--English\r\nfreemen, and we misrepresent them and the struggle through which they\r\nfought, if we look upon them as bound with manacles. They had an\r\nappreciation of what belonged to an English subject. And because the\r\nmother country refused representation where she imposed taxation,\r\ntherefore those forefathers arose in their English manhood, protested\r\nagainst the abuse of governmental power, and asserted that where there\r\nis taxation, there should be representation; and had Patrick Henry been\r\nadmitted into the British Parliament to represent her American colonies,\r\nthe United States of America to-day would have been the grandest portion\r\nof the empire of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same discourse the orator said:\r\n\r\n\"Behold England of to-day, in her rule at home, as well as in her policy\r\ntowards her colonies, pressing upon her colonial possessions practical\r\nindependence. She demands that they shall be so far free as to legislate\r\nfor themselves, and pay their own expenses. England is now gathering\r\ntogether her representatives from Africa, and proposes under her benign\r\nsway to form a republican government for long-despised and down-trodden\r\nAfrica. Whatever may be said of the Old East India Company under British\r\nprotection, let me say, from personal observation, that from the eternal\r\nsnows of the Himalayas to the spicy groves of Ceylon, India of to-day\r\nhas a wise and paternal government given her by Christian England.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: Thompson's History of the War of 1812, Chap. xxx.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: As in the storming of the fort at York, the explosion\r\nwhich took place was and is a matter of dispute, and as to whether the\r\nexplosion was accidental, or caused by the British; so it is a matter of\r\nunsettled dispute as to whether the explosion of Fort Erie was caused by\r\nthe Americans, or was accidental. General Pike was killed in the\r\nexplosion which took place in the fort at York, and Colonels Drummond\r\nand Scott were killed at the explosion of Fort Erie: many of the British\r\nand Canadians were killed in the explosion in the fort at York, but none\r\nof the Americans were killed at the explosion in Fort Erie.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: The greater part of the foregoing accounts of the\r\ncampaign of 1814 are extracted and condensed from Thompson's and\r\nChristie's Histories of the War of 1812, compared with other histories\r\nof the same events.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS, EXTRACTED FROM MANUSCRIPTS\r\nRESPECTING THE U.E. LOYALISTS IN THE DOMINION LIBRARY AT OTTAWA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CHARACTER OF THE MILITIA.\" ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\nI. \"Amongst the first settlers on the frontier of Upper Canada were\r\nthose faithful and loyal men, the United Empire Loyalists, with the Six\r\nNations of Indians, who, at the sacrifice of their all, were steadfast\r\nto the British Crown during the revolutionary struggle of the old\r\nBritish colonies, now the United States, for independence, and other\r\nUnited States citizens who had adopted Canada as a home for themselves\r\nand their children. That struggle ended by the treaty of 1783.\r\n\r\n\"Those faithful men, the U.E. Loyalists and their associates, sought an\r\nasylum under Britain's Crown in this, the then wilderness of Canada,\r\nwhich now stands as one of the most flourishing provinces of our beloved\r\nSovereign. In that then wilderness the flag of England was unfurled, and\r\nafter the lapse of one century, and on the commencement of another, that\r\nflag floats triumphantly over this loyal Canadian land. Those first\r\nsettlers were our first militiamen, under our first and venerated\r\nGovernor, Sir John Graves Simcoe, in the year 1791.\r\n\r\n\"The descendants of those faithful men, with some soldiers and sailors\r\nand others, the sons of Britain who had adopted Canada, were our first\r\nmilitiamen in the war of 1812; and those who are left of them are\r\ntherefore the veteran soldiers of 1812. The war was declared by the\r\nUnited States Government against Great Britain, June 18th,\r\n1812--involving Imperial interests alone, and not those of the\r\ncolonies.[224] This declaration of war against Britain was the signal\r\nfor the loyal inhabitants of Canada to rush _en masse_ to the frontier\r\nof their country to repel invasion. In this momentous crisis we met our\r\nbeloved Governor and Commander-in-Chief, the late Major-General Sir\r\nIsaac Brock, on the Niagara frontier, whose monument stands on the\r\nbattle ground of Queenston Heights. That monument stands in remembrance\r\nof him who sacrificed his valuable life in duty to his King and in\r\ndefence of our Canadian homes; in memory of him who caused the youthful\r\npart of the Militia of Upper Canada to be embodied in the Militia Flank\r\nCompanies, to be trained for actual service in their country's defence;\r\nin remembrance of him in whom their entire confidence was placed--for\r\nwhere he led they were sure to follow.\"\r\n\r\nII. The invasions of Canada by the Americans during the war were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                              Men.\r\n\r\n1. General Hull, at Sandwich                  3,000\r\n\r\n2. General Van Rensellaer, at Queenston       2,000\r\n\r\n3. General Smyth, at Fort Erie                3,000\r\n\r\n4. General Pike, Toronto                      2,500\r\n\r\n5. General Dearborn, Fort George              3,000\r\n\r\n6. General Winchester, Chrystler's Farm,\r\n      for Montreal                            3,000\r\n\r\n7. General Hampton, Chateauguay river, L.C.,\r\n      for Montreal                            8,000\r\n\r\n8. General Brown, Fort Erie                   5,000\r\n\r\n9. General Brown, Lundy's Lane                5,000\r\n\r\n10. General Izzard, Fort Erie                 8,000\r\n\r\n11. General Wilkinson, Lacolle Mills, L.C.    2,500\r\n\r\nTotal number of invaders                     45,000\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is an aggregate of the United States forces employed in\r\nthe attempt to invade and take Canada, when they desired peace; and\r\nwhen peace was proclaimed, they did not find themselves in possession of\r\nan inch of Canadian territory.\r\n\r\n\"Thus it may be said as the opinion of all, that if the loyal\r\ninhabitants of Canada had not, in those days of trial and privation,\r\nstood to their arms under General Brock and other generals, Canada might\r\nnot at this day be a continued appendage of the British Crown. In\r\ncorroboration of this opinion, I here insert General Brock's answer to\r\nan address of the magistrates at Niagara after Hull's surrender of\r\nDetroit. General Brock said--\r\n\r\n\"That had not Western Canada rose in their might as one man, in defence\r\nof their rights, and in support of the constitution of Great Britain,\r\nhis hands would have been as if tied, being without the aid of the\r\nregular British troops, who were all then engaged in the European war.\r\n\r\n\"Truly extracted from my book,\r\n\r\n\"JOHN CLARKE,\r\n\"Captain-Adjutant-General of Militia, 1812, '13, '14.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Clarke says of himself: \"I was placed on duty by General Brock\r\nfrom the commencement of the war of 1812, as Lieutenant and Adjutant of\r\nthe 4th Lincoln flank companies. In March I was promoted to the rank of\r\nCaptain-Assistant-Adjutant-General of Militia by General Sir Roger H.\r\nSheaffe, Administrator of the Government of Upper Canada; which place I\r\nretained until the peace of 1815.\"--\"I served throughout the rebellion\r\nof 1837 and 1838--being invested with the command of an organized\r\nregiment of militia, the First Frontier Light Infantry.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Clarke's recollections and reminiscences are in every respect\r\nreliable, and are very valuable, extending to nearly 300 manuscript\r\nquarto pages, in the Parliamentary Library at Ottawa (entitled \"U.E.\r\nLoyalists\"). His own contributions are entitled, \"Memoirs of Colonel\r\nJohn Clarke, of Port Dalhousie, C.W.; born in Canada in 1783: giving an\r\naccount of the family's early arrival in the country in 1768; the\r\nprogress of the settlers; the arrival of Governor Simcoe, his\r\nimprovements and government; settlement of the Indians; the war of\r\n1812--full particulars; the rebellion of 1837; the Welland Canal, and\r\nvarious other things connected with the progressive growth of Upper\r\nCanada.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF CANADIANS BY THE AMERICANS WHO INVADED CANADA.\r\n\r\n\"In 1812 General Hull invaded the British province of Upper Canada, and\r\ntook possession of the town of Sandwich. He threatened (by proclamation)\r\nto exterminate the inhabitants if they made any resistance. He plundered\r\nthose with whom he had been on habits of intimacy for years before the\r\nwar. Their plate and linen were found in his possession after his\r\nsurrender to General Brock. He marked out the loyal subjects of the King\r\nas objects of his peculiar resentment, and consigned their property to\r\npillage and conflagration.\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn of 1812, several houses and barns were burnt by the\r\nAmerican forces near Fort Erie, Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n\"In 1813--April--the public buildings of York, the capital of Upper\r\nCanada, were burnt by the troops of the United States, contrary to the\r\narticles of capitulation. These public buildings consisted of two\r\nelegant halls, with convenient offices for the accommodation of the\r\nLegislature and the Courts of Justice. The library and all the papers\r\nand records belonging to these institutions were consumed at the same\r\ntime. The Church was robbed, and the town library perfectly pillaged.\r\nCommodore Chauncey, who has generally behaved honourably, was so ashamed\r\nof this last transaction, that he endeavoured to collect the books\r\nbelonging to the town and legislative library, and actually sent back\r\ntwo boxes filled with them; but hardly any were complete. Much private\r\nproperty was plundered, and several houses left in a state of ruin.\r\n\r\n\"In June, 1813, Newark, Niagara, came into possession of the army of the\r\nUnited States, and its inhabitants were repeatedly promised protection\r\nto themselves and property by Generals Dearborn and Boyd. In the midst\r\nof these professions, the most respectable of them, although\r\nnon-combatants, were made prisoners and sent to the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Two churches were burnt to the ground. Detachments were sent under the\r\ndirection of British traitors [of whom the traitor deserter Wilcox was\r\nthe leader] to pillage the loyal inhabitants in the neighbourhood. Many\r\nfarm-houses were burnt during the summer; and, at length, to fill up the\r\nmeasure of iniquity, the whole beautiful town of Newark, with a short\r\nprevious intimation--so short as to amount to none, and in an intense\r\ncold day of the 10th of December--was consigned to the flames.\r\n\r\n\"The wretched inhabitants had scarcely time to save themselves, much\r\nless any of their property. More than 400 women and children were\r\nexposed without shelter, on the night of December the 10th, to the\r\ninclement cold of a Canadian winter. A great number must have perished,\r\nhad not the flight of the American troops, after perpetrating their\r\nunfeeling act, enabled the inhabitants of the country to come to their\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\"President Madison has attempted to justify this cruel act as necessary\r\nfor the defence of Fort George. Nothing can be more false. The town was\r\nsome distance from the fort; and instead of thinking to defend it,\r\nGeneral McClure was actually retreating to his own shore when he caused\r\nNewark (Niagara) to be burnt. This officer says that he acted in\r\nconformity with the orders of his Government.\r\n\r\n\"The American Government, finding their defence useless, disavow the\r\nconduct of McClure, who appears to have been a fit agent for such a\r\nGovernment. He not only complied with his instructions; but he refined\r\nupon them, by choosing a day of intense severity, giving the inhabitants\r\nalmost no warning until the fire began, and the conflagration in the\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n(The above facts relating to the burning, etc., are extracted from the\r\nproceedings of the Loyal Patriotic Society of Upper Canada, established\r\nat York for the relief of sufferers in the war; and of which Chief\r\nJustice Scott was President.)\r\n\r\n_The Royal and Patriotic Society of Upper Canada_ was established at\r\nToronto, extended its branches to different parts of the Province,\r\nexisted from 1812 to 1815, and did a great deal for the relief of\r\nsufferers by the war. On the destruction of the town of Niagara, large\r\nsubscriptions were obtained and distributed for the relief of the\r\nsufferers. The following are extracts from its recorded proceedings:\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants came forward in the most noble manner, as well as the\r\ngallant officers of his Majesty's troops.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sheaffe          £200\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Bishop       100\r\n\r\nwith a vast number of liberal subscriptions, according to the means of\r\nthe donors: so that in a short time upwards of £2,000 was raised to\r\ncommence with.\r\n\r\nCity of Kingston sent          £500\r\n\r\nAmherstburg      \"              300\r\n\r\nCity of Montreal \"            3,000\r\n\r\nQuebec           \"            1,500\r\n\r\n\"The amount raised in the first year was £10,000.\r\n\r\n\"Eight hundred and sixty-four (864) families were relieved from\r\nstarvation by this timely aid.\r\n\r\n\"The following summer a large meeting was held in London (England), at\r\nwhich the Duke of Kent, who had visited Canada twenty years before,\r\npresided. By his influence a very large sum was subscribed. The Bank of\r\nEngland graced the list with £1,000. This effort produced another\r\n£10,000.\r\n\r\nKingston in Jamaica sent       £2,000\r\n\r\nNova Scotia         \"           2,500\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, the liberality evinced in all quarters was of the greatest\r\nservice to the sufferers, and gladdened many bowed down by sorrow and\r\nindigence.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of these interesting particulars may be seen in the\r\nTransactions of the Society, published in Toronto, 1814.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to the reader if I subjoin the address of the\r\nPresident, explanatory of the origin, character, and objects of this\r\nnoble Society, the former existence of which is now scarcely known:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AN ADDRESS\r\n\r\n\"_Copied from the Proceedings of the Loyal Patriotic Society of Upper\r\nCanada, who, by their funds, relieved much real distress to families in\r\nthe war of 1812, '13, '14._\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,--In the unprovoked war waged against us by the American\r\nGovernment, Providence hath evidently smiled on the justice of our\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\"But our exertions have been attended with many privations and\r\nsacrifices hard to be borne, and should hostilities continue many more\r\nwill be required.\r\n\r\n\"In order to mitigate some of these, the inhabitants of York came\r\nforward to contribute toward the comforts of the flank companies; and a\r\nlarge sum of money was raised for that purpose, of which the greater\r\npart is expended.\r\n\r\n\"But, on reflection, it appeared that something more might be done of a\r\npermanent nature, and that portion of the inhabitants who are not liable\r\nto military duty, eager to prove that their zeal in the cause is not\r\ninferior to that of those in actual service, formed themselves into a\r\nSociety, named '_The Loyal Patriotic Society of Upper Canada_,' for the\r\nfollowing distinct purposes:\r\n\r\n\"1st. To afford aid and relief to such families of the militia, in all\r\nparts of the Province, as shall be made to appear to experience\r\nparticular distress, in consequence of the death or absence of some of\r\ntheir friends and relations.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. To afford like aid and relief to such militiamen as have been or\r\nshall be disabled from labour by their wounds or otherwise in course of\r\nthe service aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. To reward merit, excite and commemorate glorious events, by\r\nbestowing medals or other honorary marks of public approbation or\r\ndistinction for extraordinary instances of personal courage or fidelity\r\nin defence of the Province by individuals, either of his Majesty's\r\nregular troops or militia forces.\r\n\r\n\"4th. Also the seamen on the lakes.\r\n\r\n\"This Society, so honourable in its nature, and which we hope will prove\r\nmost important in its consequences, was first suggested by the\r\nHonourable Mr. Selby, and was received with acclamation.\r\n\r\n\"In a public meeting of the gentlemen of York and its vicinity, the\r\nChief explained the great advantages likely to result from it, if\r\ngenerally supported; and, assisted by his most respectable colleagues,\r\nprepared views for its management. To these the meeting gave their\r\ncordial assent, and in a few minutes nearly $2,000 per annum was\r\nsubscribed. There are some who have given during the continuance of the\r\nwar one-tenth of their income.\r\n\r\n\"General Sheaffe, in a letter to the Chief Justice, our chairman, not\r\nonly extols, in earnest language, the objects of the Society, but, far\r\nexceeding our expectations, presents us with £200. Colonel Bishop, a\r\nstranger [who was afterwards mortally wounded at Black Rock], and not\r\nan inhabitant of the Province, with a liberality above all praise,\r\nsubscribes £100.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, our object in addressing you is to procure your\r\nco-operation. Foremost in deeds of warlike glory, we desire that you\r\nshould become sharers in the work of benevolence.\r\n\r\n\"Let your contributions be as small as you please--a halfpenny, a\r\nfarthing per day--anything to show your good-will.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the value of what you give; it is your countenance that we\r\nmainly desire.\r\n\r\n\"We know that your means are narrow, but your example is inestimable;\r\nand we shall be proud of having you for our companions and supporters in\r\nmitigating the distress incident to the war.\r\n\r\n\"And when it is heard that the York Volunteers and their comrades, among\r\nthe first in danger, have patronized this Society, the militia of other\r\ndistricts will be anxious to emulate the military glory of the\r\nconquerors of Detroit and Queenston, and will hasten to emulate you in\r\ncontributing to the support of our benevolent design.\r\n\r\n\"Those that join will intimate to the captains what they are willing to\r\ngive, while they are in active service, that it may be paid over monthly\r\nto the treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"And they will remember that they are soothing the sick and the wounded\r\nin war, protecting aged parents and helpless children, and doing all\r\nthey can to comfort those whom they love and revere, who suffer during\r\nthe horrors of war.\"\r\n\r\n(Signed)  CHIEF JUSTICE SCOTT,\r\n_President_.\r\n\r\nALEX. WOOD,\r\n_Secretary_.\r\n\r\nThe above excellent address is understood to have been written by the\r\nlate Dr. Strachan, first Bishop of the Church of England of Toronto, and\r\nwho acted the part of a true, a bold, and generous patriot during the\r\nwar of 1812-15.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Yet while the American Government professed to declare a\r\n_defensive_ war--a war in defence of their rights at sea--the first act\r\nwas _the invasion of Canada_, for which they had been collecting men and\r\narms for several months before the declaration of the war; and thus the\r\nfirst acts of the Canadians were to provide for the defence of their\r\ncountry and their homes against the American invasions. The facts show\r\nthat the real object of the American Government was to take Canada, and\r\ntheir invaded rights at sea was a mere pretext.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nCLOSE OF THE WAR AND OF THE HISTORY OF THE U.E. LOYALISTS--DEFEAT AND\r\nDISGRACE OF THE DEMOCRATIC INVADERS OF CANADA--HONOUR AND SUCCESS OF ITS\r\nDEFENDERS--COMPARATIVE STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AT THE\r\nCLOSE OF THE WAR--MUTUAL RESPECT AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN AMERICANS AND\r\nCANADIANS--CONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus closed the war of the United States against Great Britain, in\r\n1812-15--a war undertaken at the prompting of the scourge of Europe,\r\nNapoleon, but upon pretexts which were never so much as mentioned, much\r\nless reiterated, by the United States Commissioners when peace was\r\nproposed between Great Britain and America in 1815--a war in which the\r\ndemocratic rulers of the United States suffered both defeat and\r\ndisgrace, while the loyal inhabitants of Canada maintained inviolate\r\ntheir honour and independence.\r\n\r\nWith the close of that war terminates the history of the United Empire\r\nLoyalists of Canada as a distinct and controlling class of the\r\ninhabitants; for their numbers had become so reduced by the ravages of\r\ntime and war, and other classes of immigrants had become so numerous,\r\nbetween whom and the families of old Loyalists so many intermarriages\r\nhad taken and were taking place, that the latter became merged in the\r\nmass of the population; and therefore my history of them as a distinct\r\nclass comes to an end. All classes were Loyalists, and all had fought as\r\none man in defence of their country during the recent war, although all\r\nhad not fought for the life of the nation and the unity of the empire\r\nfrom 1776 to 1783, or been driven from their homes to Canada, to become\r\nthe fathers of the inhabitants and founders of the institutions of our\r\ncountry. It would be out of place, and at variance with the title of my\r\nbook, did I proceed to narrate and discuss the history of Upper Canada\r\nafter the close of the war; but I may properly conclude my work by\r\nreferring to a few facts leading to and arising out of the war, and the\r\nstate of our country at its close.\r\n\r\nThe democratic party in the United States, which had confiscated the\r\nproperty of our forefathers, and exiled them from their homes, and\r\ncompelled them to seek a home in the wilderness of Canada, had followed\r\nthem with their enmities into their new place of refuge, and, by their\r\nemissaries, in conjunction with those of the French revolutionists,\r\nsought to insinuate a disturbing element into Canadian peace and safety\r\nfrom the commencement of the bloody French revolution to 1812, when it\r\nculminated, under the promptings of Napoleon and his obsequious tools,\r\nin the war of 1812-15, with a view to wrest Canada from Great Britain,\r\nand to divide the commerce of Europe between France and the United\r\nStates. But how vain are the devices of men against the laws of God and\r\nof human society! The Gideon hundreds of loyal Canadians repelled and\r\nscattered, for more than two years, the Midian and Amalekite thousands\r\nof democratic invaders, until Great Britain, having chained the\r\nmarauding tiger of Europe to the rock of St. Helena, despatched her\r\nthousands of soldiers to the aid of Canada, and sent her fleets across\r\nthe Atlantic--sweeping the American coasts from Maine to Georgia--taking\r\nand burning their capital in retaliation for the American raid upon the\r\ncapital of Upper Canada, and soon compelling the heretofore boasting\r\nMadison partizans to seek for peace without even the mention of their\r\nalleged causes of war with England. If the American armies were defeated\r\nand driven back in their repeated invasions of Canada, their commerce\r\nand commercial men suffered not less before the end of the war. Their\r\nannual exports declined, between 1811 and 1814, from £22,000,000\r\nsterling to £1,500,000; their vessels to the number of 3,000 were\r\ncaptured; two-thirds of their commercial class were reduced to\r\nbankruptcy; an immense war tax was incurred; many thousands of lives had\r\nbeen sacrificed, and the Union itself imperilled by the threatened\r\nsecession of the New England States.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Canada had felt deeply the calamities of war, it\r\nbeing the seat of the conflict, a large portion of its revenue and\r\ninhabitants having been diverted from their ordinary employments--having\r\nthemselves chiefly to depend upon for their defence, while England was\r\nengaged in a twenty years' conflict for law and liberty in Europe. In\r\nthe extremity of this contest, the democratic President of the United\r\nStates combined with the tyrant despot of Europe to seduce and sever the\r\nCanadians from their British connection; but the Canadians nobly\r\nmaintained their fidelity and triumphantly vindicated their honour and\r\nindependence, though, in doing so, they suffered the desolation of many\r\nof their homes, shed many bitter tears for sires, and sons, and\r\nbrothers, who had poured out their life's blood in defence of their\r\ncountry on the battle fields of both Upper and Lower Canada. Yet, upon\r\nthe whole, the war did much good to Canada, apart from the success of\r\nits arms; it tended to cement the people together as one family;\r\nEnglish, French, Scotch, Irish, and Americans had forgotten former\r\ndistinctions and jealousies, and had all become Canadians, with\r\nincreased devotion not only to the land of their nativity or adoption,\r\nbut to the glorious mother country which had become the victorious\r\nchampion of the liberties of Europe, and leader in the civilization of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThough, in the course of the war, Canada--especially Upper Canada, which\r\nhad to bear the brunt of it--was greatly exhausted, emigration being\r\nchecked, agriculture partially neglected, by the embodiments of militia\r\nand frequent mobilization of sedentary corps,--requiring some time after\r\nthe war for the inhabitants to return to their old habits and resume\r\ntheir peaceful pursuits; yet Canada flourished financially during the\r\nwar. Owing to England's supremacy on the ocean, Canadian trade and\r\ncommerce were not seriously affected; taxes were light; not a few\r\nfortunes were made; money was plentiful, as the mother country paid most\r\nof the expenses of the war.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as one of the notable features of the war, that\r\nno class of Canadians were more loyal, none more brave and devoted to\r\nthe defence of the Government and institutions of the country, than were\r\nthe Americans who had become settlers in Canada--not the United Empire\r\nLoyalists alone, but those who had from time to time emigrated from the\r\nUnited States of their own accord, and not on account of political\r\npersecution, as was the case with the old Loyalists.\r\n\r\nThe unfriendly feelings and even enmities which had been excited by the\r\nwar between Canadians and Americans, soon changed into mutual respect\r\nand friendship; trade and commerce between the two countries were\r\nrenewed and increased; intermarriages multiplied, with all the amenities\r\nand intimacies of social life. Though there has always been a democratic\r\nmob faction--latterly mostly Fenian--in the United States, which has\r\nseized every opportunity to invade and disturb the peace of Canada, yet\r\nit is well understood that this freebooting faction does not represent\r\nthe sentiments or feelings of the industrious, business, commercial,\r\nintelligent, and Christian people of the United States, who, with few\r\nexceptions, are, as most of them were when Madison declared war against\r\nEngland in June, 1812, lovers of peace, law, and order, and friends of\r\nEngland and Canada, as well as of mankind; and we believe there are no\r\nmore ardent well-wishers on the continent of America for the happiness\r\nand prosperity of the citizens of the American Republic than the loyal\r\nand patriotic inhabitants of Canada.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps be expected to add a few words on the chief public\r\noccurrences which took place in Upper Canada after the war, but without\r\ndiscussing any of the questions which they involved.\r\n\r\nFrom 1791 to the close of the war in 1815, and for some years\r\nafterwards, the Executive Government of the day commanded the votes of a\r\nmajority of the House of Assembly. Public questions and measures were\r\nfreely discussed; but no organized opposition appeared in the Assembly\r\nagainst the Administration. Shortly after the close of the war, however,\r\nthe elements of discord began to be developed in the country. Many\r\ndischarged officers of the British army, at the termination of the long\r\nEuropean war, came to Canada with instructions from the Secretary of\r\nState for the Colonies to the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada\r\n(himself an English officer), to provide for them; and they were\r\nappointed to all offices of emolument (with few exceptions), to the\r\nexclusion of the old Loyalists and their descendants and other\r\ninhabitants who had felled the wilderness, and made the country\r\nvaluable, and had borne the burden and heat of the war in its defence.\r\nThe administration of the Crown or Public Lands was sadly defective and\r\npartial, giving whole blocks to friends and speculators, while the\r\napplications of the legitimate settler were often rejected. It also\r\nbegan to be complained of that these large blocks of land given to\r\nindividuals, and the one-seventh of the lands set apart as Clergy\r\nReserves, greatly impeded the settlement and improvement of the country;\r\nthat those who had occupied the Clergy Reserves on _leases_ were\r\nrequired to pay higher rents on the renewal of their leases, or the\r\npurchase of the Reserves, on account of their increased value created by\r\nthe labour of the tenants and their neighbours. A special Board of\r\nManagement was appointed for these Reserves in the interest of the\r\nclerical claimants of them. The representatives of the Church of\r\nScotland claimed to share in the proceeds of the Clergy Reserves, and a\r\nco-ordinate standing with the Church of England, as the endowed Church\r\nestablishment of Upper Canada. The other religious persuasions had not\r\nthe privilege of having matrimony solemnized by their own ministers, or\r\nthe right of holding a bit of ground on which to worship God, or in\r\nwhich to bury their dead. It soon began to be claimed by the leaders of\r\nthe Church of England that their Church had the sole right to the Clergy\r\nReserves and to all the prerogatives of _the_ Established Church, whose\r\nsupremacy and endowments, it was now pretended, were essential to the\r\nloyalty of the people; notwithstanding, no people could have been more\r\nloyal than the Canadian people during the then recent war in defence of\r\nBritish supremacy, and who were as brave as they were loyal, though\r\nthere were not then three settled Episcopal clergymen in all Upper\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThese, with various co-ordinate and minor causes, lost to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor and his Executive Council the control and confidence\r\nof the representatives of the people, and in less than ten years after\r\nthe war, the Governor and Council fell into a hopeless minority in the\r\nHouse of Assembly, but in opposition to it actually governed the country\r\nfor fifteen years, until the dissatisfaction of the people became so\r\ngeneral and strong that Commissions of Inquiry were sent out from\r\nEngland, which resulted in placing all religious persuasions on an equal\r\nfooting before the law, in applying the proceeds of the Clergy Reserves\r\nto the general purposes of the education and improvement of the country,\r\nin making the heads of public departments (who were to be Executive\r\nCouncillors) responsible to the House of Assembly, and holding their\r\noffices no longer than they enjoyed its confidence. From that time\r\nforward the Government became strong, the people contented, and the\r\ncountry prosperous and rapidly increasing in wealth, education, and\r\nintelligence--rendering, at this day, the inhabitants of the vast\r\nDominion of Canada the lightest-taxed and the freest people on the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbercrombie (General)--Arrives in America with the troops, and forty\r\n   German officers to drill and command regiments in America (which\r\n   gives offence to the Colonists). i. 257.\r\n\r\n Is disgracefully defeated by Montcalm (though commanding the largest\r\n   force ever assembled in America). i. 258.\r\n\r\n With General Loudoun, hesitates and delays at Albany, while the French\r\n   generals are active and successful. i. 258.\r\n\r\nAdams (John)--The prompter and adviser of hanging \"Tories.\" ii. 127.\r\n\r\nAddress of Governor Winthrop and his company on leaving England, in\r\n   1630, to their \"Fathers and Brethren of the Church of England,\"\r\n   declaring their filial and undying love to the Church of England,\r\n   as their \"dear mother,\" from whose breasts they had derived their\r\n   nourishment. i. 55.\r\n\r\nAlliance between Congress and the Kings of France not productive of\r\n   the effect anticipated, and deferred twelve months by France after\r\n    it had been applied for by Congress. ii. 1.\r\n\r\nAmerican Affairs--Misrepresented in the English Parliament and by\r\n   the English Press. i. 390.\r\n\r\nAmerican boastings groundless over the surrender of Cornwallis. ii. 46.\r\n\r\nAmerican Colonies--Their position in regard to England and other nations\r\n   at the Peace of Paris, 1763. i. 274.\r\n\r\nAmerican Revolution--primary cause of it. i. 30.\r\n\r\nAmerican treatment of Canadians by Americans who invaded them. ii. 464.\r\n\r\n Invasions of Canada, and their forces. ii. 262.\r\n\r\nAmherst (Lord)--Supersedes Abercrombie as Commander-in-Chief, assisted\r\n  by General Wolfe. i. 260.\r\n\r\n Plans three expeditions, all of which are successful. i. 261.\r\n\r\n His energetic movements. i. 262.\r\n\r\n He receives all Canada for the King from the French. i. 267.\r\n\r\n His parting address to the army. i. 268.\r\n\r\nAnderson (Samuel). ii. 192.\r\n\r\nAndros (Edmond)--Appointed local Governor of Massachusetts Bay, and\r\n  Governor-General of New England; his tyranny; seized at Boston and\r\n  sent prisoner to England. i. 215.\r\n\r\n (Examined)--Acquitted by King William in Council, because he had acted\r\n  according to his instructions. i. 215.\r\n\r\nArticles of treaty and preamble. ii. 56.\r\n\r\nAssociations in the Colonies against the use of tea imported from\r\n  England. i. 370.\r\n\r\n\r\nBancroft--Confirms the statement as to the aggressions and pretensions of\r\n  the Massachusetts Bay Government. i. 200.\r\n\r\n His interpretations against England. i. 247.\r\n\r\nBaptists--The persecution of them instigated by the Rev.
