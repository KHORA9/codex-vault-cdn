Jackson as Representative of the United\r\nStates and as its Chief of Counsel in the preparation and prosecution of\r\nthe case against the major Axis war criminals. Since that date and up to\r\nthe present, the staff of the Office of Chief of Counsel, or OCC, has\r\nbeen engaged continuously in the discovery, collection, examination,\r\ntranslation, and marshalling of documentary evidence demonstrating the\r\ncriminality of the former leaders of the German Reich. Since the 20th\r\nday of November 1945, a considerable part of this documentary arsenal\r\nhas been directed against the 22 major Nazi war criminals who are on\r\ntrial before the International Military Tribunal in Nurnberg. As of this\r\nwriting the American and British cases-in-chief, on Counts I and II of\r\nthe Indictment charging, respectively, conspiracy and the waging of wars\r\nof aggression, have been completed.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no need to recall in these pages that the Nurnberg\r\ntrial represents the first time in history that legal proceedings have\r\nbeen instituted against leaders of an enemy nation. It is perhaps equal\r\nsupererogation to state here that there are no exact precedents for the\r\ncharges made by the American, British, French, and Russian prosecutors\r\nthat to plot or wage a war of aggression is a crime for which\r\nindividuals may be punished. Yet it was because of these very facts that\r\nin its indictment the prosecution presented a challenge to itself quite\r\nas great as to the defense. A heavy burden was laid on the accusing\r\nnations to make sure that their proof measured up to the magnitude of\r\ntheir accusations, and that the daring of their grand conception was\r\nmatched by the industry of their research, lest the hard-bought\r\nopportunity to make International Law a guardian of peace should fail by\r\ndefault.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the American collecting and\r\nprocessing of documentary evidence, under the general direction of Col.\r\nRobert G. Storey, gradually developed into an operation of formidable\r\nscope. Although some pieces of evidence were secured in Washington and\r\nLondon, by far the greater part was obtained in the land of the enemy.\r\nAs the American Armies had swept into Germany, military investigating\r\nteams had filled document centers with an increasing wealth of materials\r\nwhich were freely made available by the Army to OCC field investigators.\r\nSpecial assistance was given by the Document Section, G-2 Division,\r\nSHAEF, and by the Document Sections of the Army Groups and Armies\r\noperating in the European Theater. OCC investigators also made valuable\r\ndiscoveries while prospecting on their own. They soon found themselves\r\nembarrassed with riches. Perhaps foremost among the prize acquisitions\r\nwas the neatly crated collection of all the personal and official\r\ncorrespondence of Alfred Rosenberg, together with a great quantity of\r\nNazi Party correspondence. This cache was discovered behind a false wall\r\nin an old castle in Eastern Bavaria, where it had been sent for\r\nsafekeeping. Another outstanding collection consisted of thirty-nine\r\nleather-bound volumes containing detailed inventories of the art\r\ntreasures of Europe which had been looted by the _Einsatzstab\r\nRosenberg_. These catalogues, together with much of the priceless\r\nplunder itself, were found hidden deep in an Austrian salt mine. An\r\ninnocent-appearing castle near Marburg was found to contain some 485\r\ntons of crated papers, which inspection revealed to be the records of\r\nthe German Foreign Office from 1837 to 1944. Among other outstanding\r\nbulk acquisitions were more than 300 crates of German High Command\r\nfiles, 85 notebooks containing minutes of Hitler’s conferences, and the\r\ncomplete files of the German Navy.\r\n\r\nThe task was to screen thoroughly this abundance of material so as to\r\noverlook no relevant item, and yet at the same time to obtain the proof\r\nand to translate it in season, so as not to delay preparation of the\r\nIndictment or commencement of the trial. The procedures followed in this\r\nprocess are described in the affidavit of Maj. William H. Coogan\r\n(_001-A-PS_), which is listed numerically among the documents. As a\r\nresult of those procedures, more than 100,000 documents were\r\nindividually examined in order to segregate those of importance. Of\r\nthese 100,000 documents, approximately 4,000 were found to be of clear\r\nor potential value. This group of 4,000 was further reduced through\r\nexacting standards of elimination to a total of some 2,000 documents\r\nwhich it was proposed to offer in evidence, and which make up the bulk\r\nof this publication. Thus, the documents presented in these volumes are\r\nthe fittest survivors of a rigorous sifting. Each of them has met\r\nrequirements designed to ensure the selection of only the most\r\nsignificant in bearing on the American case. Documents primarily\r\nconcerned with the report of individual barbarities or perversions were\r\nexcluded, in conformity with the emphasis placed upon those tending to\r\nprove elements in the Nazi Master Plan.\r\n\r\nThese documents consist, in the main, of official papers found in\r\narchives of the German Government and Nazi Party, diaries and letters of\r\nprominent Germans, and captured reports and orders. There are included,\r\nin addition, excerpts from governmental and Party decrees, from official\r\nnewspapers and from authoritative German publications. The authenticity\r\nof all these materials is established by Maj. Coogan’s affidavit\r\n(_001-A-PS_). Considered together, they reveal a fairly comprehensive\r\nview of the inner workings and outward deeds of the German government\r\nand of the Nazi Party, which were always concealed from the world, and\r\nfor which, the world will always hold the Hitler regime in horror and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nIt is important that it be clearly understood what this collection of\r\ndocuments is not. In the first place, it is neither an official record,\r\nnor an unofficial transcript of the trial proceedings. It is not\r\ndesigned to reproduce what has taken place in court. It is merely the\r\ndocumentary evidence prepared by the American and British prosecuting\r\nstaffs, and is in no wise under the sponsorship of the Tribunal. It is\r\npresented in the belief that this collection containing the full text of\r\nthe documents, classified under appropriate subjects, may be more useful\r\nto students of the Nurnberg trial than the official record, when\r\nprepared, may be.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this goes back to the first few days of the trial, when\r\nthe Tribunal ruled that it would treat no written matter as in evidence\r\nunless it was read in full, word by word, in court. The purpose of the\r\nruling was to enable the documentary material which the American and\r\nBritish staffs had translated from German into English to be further\r\ntranslated into Russian and French through the simultaneous interpreting\r\nsystem in the courtroom. The consequence, however, was to enforce upon\r\nthe American and British prosecution the task of trimming their evidence\r\ndrastically unless the trial was to be protracted to an unconscionable\r\nlength. Counsel therefore had to content themselves in most instances\r\nwith introducing, by reading _verbatim_, only the most vital parts of\r\nthe documents relied upon. Only these evidentiary minima appear in the\r\ndaily transcript, and presumably, since no more is officially in\r\nevidence under the Tribunal’s ruling, no more can properly be included\r\nin the official record. It has frequently been the case, furthermore,\r\nthat different parts of certain documents were read in proof of\r\ndifferent allegations, and hence are scattered throughout the\r\ntranscript. American counsel, in several instances, read only sketchy\r\nportions of some documents, leaving other portions, at the request of\r\nthe French and Soviet delegations, to be read later as a part of their\r\ncase. Still other portions of the same document will undoubtedly be read\r\nlater on by the defense. It is an unavoidable consequence that the\r\ntranscript itself will be a thing of shreds and patches, and that any\r\ncomprehensive and orderly notion of the documentary evidence must be\r\nobtained elsewhere. The documentary excerpts, when accompanied by the\r\nexplanation of trial counsel, are of course sufficient for the trial and\r\nfor the judgment of the Tribunal. But the purposes of historians and\r\nscholars will very likely lead them to wish to examine the documents in\r\ntheir entirety. It is to those long-range interests that these volumes\r\nare in the main addressed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this collection of documents is not the American case. It is\r\nat once more and less than that. It is less, because it of course cannot\r\ninclude the captured motion picture and still photographic evidence\r\nrelied upon, and because it contains only a few of the organizational\r\ncharts and visual presentation exhibits utilized at the trial. It is\r\nmore, because although it does contain all the evidence introduced\r\neither in part or in whole by the American staff in proof of Count I, it\r\nalso includes many documents not introduced into evidence at all. There\r\nwere various reasons for not offering this material to the Tribunal: the\r\ndocuments were cumulative in nature, better documents were available on\r\nthe same point, or the contents did not justify the time required for\r\nreading. (The document index at the end of Volume VIII is marked to\r\nindicate which documents were introduced, either in whole or in part, in\r\nevidence.) Of more than 800 American documents so far introduced in\r\nevidence, a small number were received through judicial notice or oral\r\nsummarization, while some 500 were read, in part or in whole, in court.\r\nApproximately 200 more went into evidence in the first few days of the\r\ntrial, under an earlier ruling of the Tribunal which admitted documents\r\nwithout reading, and merely on filing with the court after proof of\r\nauthenticity. Of the documents not now in evidence and thus not before\r\nthe Tribunal for consideration in reaching its decision, many have been\r\nturned over to the French and Soviet prosecuting staffs and, by the time\r\nthese volumes are published, will have been introduced in the course of\r\ntheir cases. Others will have been put before the Tribunal by the\r\nAmerican case in rebuttal or utilized in cross-examining witnesses\r\ncalled by the defense.\r\n\r\nThis publication includes a series of affidavits prepared under the\r\ndirection of Col. John Harlan Amen, chief of the OCC Interrogation\r\nDivision. Those which were introduced into evidence are listed among the\r\ndocuments in the _PS_ series. A number of affidavits which were not\r\noffered to the Tribunal are printed in a separate section at the end of\r\nthe document series. Affidavits of the latter type were prepared in an\r\nattempt to eliminate surprise by delineating clearly the testimony which\r\nthe affiant might be expected to give in court, should it be decided to\r\ncall him as a witness. In the case of the affiants who testified in\r\ncourt, their affidavits represent a substantially accurate outline of\r\ntheir testimony on direct examination. Others of the affiants may, by\r\nthe time of publication, have been called as rebuttal witnesses for the\r\nprosecution. In addition, there are included selected statements of\r\ncertain defendants and prisoners written to the prosecutors from prison.\r\nIt should be mentioned in this connection that as a result of many\r\nmonths of exhaustive questioning of the defendants, prisoners of war,\r\nand other potential witnesses, the Interrogation Division has harvested\r\napproximately 15,000 typewritten pages of valuable and previously\r\nunavailable information on a variety of subjects. These extensive\r\ntranscripts represent approximately 950 individual interrogations and\r\nare presently being edited and catalogued in Nurnberg so that the\r\nsignificant materials may be published in a useful form and within a\r\nmanageable scope, as a supplement to these present volumes.\r\n\r\nThis collection also includes approximately 200 documents obtained and\r\nprocessed by the British prosecuting staff, known as the British War\r\nCrimes Executive, and presented in substantiation of Count II of the\r\nIndictment, which the British delegation assumed the responsibility of\r\nproving. It seems altogether fitting that these documents should be\r\nincluded in these volumes since, in proving illegal acts of aggression,\r\nthey naturally supplement the American documents proving the illegal\r\nconspiracy to commit aggression. The American prosecuting staff is\r\ngrateful to Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, the British Deputy Chief Prosecutor,\r\nfrom whom and from the goodly company of whose associates there has ever\r\nbeen the most generous cooperation, for consent to the publication of\r\nthe British documents by the United States Government.\r\n\r\nUnder the division of the case agreed on by the Chief Prosecutors of the\r\nfour Allied nations, the French and Soviet delegates are responsible for\r\nthe presentation of evidence bearing on the proof of Count III (War\r\nCrimes) and Count IV (Crimes against Humanity) of the Indictment. The\r\nFrench case will concern itself with these crimes when committed in the\r\nWest, while the Russian evidence will concern the commission of these\r\ncrimes in the East. None of the documents obtained by these two\r\nprosecuting nations are included in these volumes. The reason is that,\r\nat this writing, the French case has just commenced and the Soviet case\r\nwill not be reached for several weeks. Since one of the objects of this\r\nundertaking is to acquaint the American public at the earliest\r\nopportunity with the character of the evidence produced by its\r\nrepresentatives, there seems no justification in delaying publication\r\nuntil the close of the French and Russian cases, when all the\r\nprosecution documents will be available. As is indicated by the title of\r\nthese present volumes, _Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression_, this collection\r\nrelates only to Counts I and II of the Indictment, or one-half of the\r\nprosecution case. It is to be hoped, however, that supplementary volumes\r\ncontaining the French and Soviet documents may be published at a later\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFinally, this collection, by its nature limited to a part of the\r\nprosecution case, does not of course purport to present the whole story\r\nof the evidence adduced at Nurnberg. The evidence and arguments of\r\ndefense counsel will not be presented for some time, and the text of\r\nthese matters will, if possible, be included in any additional volumes,\r\nwhich it may become possible to publish.\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be useful to indicate what this collection is.\r\nThe publication is offered in accordance with the conviction which has\r\nconstantly animated the American prosecution, that only a part of its\r\nduty would have been done if it succeeded in persuading the judges of\r\nthe International Military Tribunal. Its full task will be accomplished\r\nonly if the world is also convinced of the justness of the cause. There\r\nwere always some people who, perhaps under the spell of the exposure of\r\nthe “atrocity propaganda” used in the First World War, felt that the\r\ndeceptions and the outrages laid to the Nazis were quite possibly untrue\r\nand in any event exaggerated. The mission of convincing these skeptics\r\nis one that has not been and cannot be discharged by newspaper reports\r\nof the Nurnberg proceedings, which by their nature are incomplete and\r\nevanescent. But an inspection of the Nazis’ own official records should\r\nsuffice to banish all honest doubts, and to make it undeniably clear\r\nthat those things really happened because the Nazis planned it that way.\r\nIt is the hope of the American prosecution that these volumes may in\r\nsome measure expose, for the warning of future generations as well as a\r\nreminder to the present, the anatomy of National Socialism in all its\r\nugly nakedness. Many of these documents disclose the repressive\r\ngovernmental machinery and intricate Party bureaucracy by which the\r\nNazis stifled initiative and opposition. They reveal also the image of\r\nhorror which a gang of brigands created in the name of the German state,\r\nin order to seize and maintain power for themselves at the expense of\r\nthe liberties of their own people and the lives of their neighbors.\r\nLegal proof has perhaps seldom been so overwhelming, certainly never so\r\nself-admitted, as is this proof of the deeds with which the Nazi\r\nleadership befouled the earth.\r\n\r\nYet, although these documents naturally are concerned primarily with the\r\nguilt of the leaders of the German Reich, they also contain a wealth of\r\ninformation, much of it hitherto unavailable elsewhere, on many other\r\nmatters of importance. Their pages illuminate many dark corners of\r\nrecent history. Hence, this collection has an additional purpose. It is\r\noffered as a source book, of interest to historians, political\r\nscientists, students, universities, libraries, government agencies,\r\nprivate research groups, newspaper editors, and others, so that they may\r\nsee, from the official papers of the Nazi government and from the words\r\nof its own leaders, the things that went on in Germany in the days of\r\nthat blasphemous regime. These papers, although they include a few legal\r\nmatters, are not addressed nor are they expected to appeal primarily to\r\nlawyers. The satisfaction of these professional interests must perforce\r\nbe postponed until publication of the official record of the trial.\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that such a vast collection of documents on a variety of\r\nsubjects would be useless to any one not thoroughly conversant with the\r\nfield, without some sort of guide through the maze. That is the reason\r\nfor the first two volumes, which consist of various explanatory\r\nmaterials included in order to facilitate understanding. The average\r\nreader who tries to cope with some of the more pompous of the Nazi\r\ntitles—such as _Beauftragter des Fuehrers fuer die ueberwachung des\r\nGesamten Geistigen und Weltausschaulichers Schulung und Erziehung der\r\nNSDAP_, or Delegate of the Fuehrer for the Total Supervision of\r\nIntellectual and Ideological Training and Education of the Party\r\n(Rosenberg)—is plainly in need of assistance. A Glossary of common\r\nGerman and Nazi titles, designations, and terms has therefore been\r\ncompiled. For those who are unfamiliar with the difference between a\r\n_Hauptmann_ and a _Hauptsturmfuehrer_, a table of military ranks, with\r\ntheir American equivalents, has been prepared. A brief biographical\r\ngazeteer of the more prominent Nazis, together with a listing of the\r\nmajor officials of the Government, Party, and Armed Forces, has also\r\nbeen included for reference purposes. In addition, an index of the\r\nCode-Words used by the Nazis to preserve the secrecy of the invasions\r\nthey plotted has been compiled. Moreover, in order to make clear\r\ndevelopments in the proceedings affecting the status of several of the\r\ndefendants, certain motions of counsel and rulings of the Tribunal,\r\ntogether with factual accounts, are also presented. And finally the\r\ninternational treaties relating to land warfare and prisoners of war are\r\nprinted in full (_3737-PS_; _3738-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe principal content of Volumes I and II is composed of what might be\r\ncalled essays, summarizing and connecting up most of the documents\r\nrelating to particular subjects in the order of their mention in Counts\r\nI and II of the Indictment. As an additional aid, at the end of each\r\nessay there appears a descriptive list of all documents referred to in\r\nthe essay, so that the reader may quickly discover which of the\r\npublished documents bear upon the subject in which he is interested. In\r\nmany cases these lists include documents not discussed in the essays for\r\nthe reason that they are cumulative in nature or were discovered\r\nsubsequent to the preparation of the essays.\r\n\r\nSome of these essays are adaptations of factual “trial briefs” prepared\r\nby the staff of OCC. Some of these “trial briefs” were handed to the\r\nTribunal for its assistance, while others were used only for the\r\nguidance of trial counsel. Others of the essays have been adapted from\r\nthe oral presentation and summary of counsel in court. Their difference\r\nin origin explains their difference in form. It must be borne in mind\r\nthat each of these essays, which were originally prepared for the\r\npurpose of convincing the Tribunal of the legal guilt of the defendants,\r\nhas been submitted to a process of editing and revision in order to\r\nserve a quite different purpose—to give the general reader a general\r\nand coherent conception of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nThese essays bear the marks of haste and are not offered as in any sense\r\ndefinitive or exhaustive. The task of translation from German into\r\nEnglish was a formidable one, and in many instances translations of\r\ndocuments could be made available to the brief-writers only a few days\r\nbefore the briefs were scheduled to be presented in court. In other\r\ninstances it was utterly impossible, with the constantly overburdened\r\ntranslating staff available, to translate in full all the material known\r\nto be of value if the prosecution was to be ready on the date set for\r\ntrial. The diary of Hans Frank, for example (_2233-PS_) consisted of 42\r\nvolumes, of which only a few outstanding excerpts, chosen by\r\nGerman-reading analysts, were translated. Similarly, large portions of\r\nthe 250 volumes of the Rosenberg correspondence remain still\r\nuntranslated and unused. Books, decrees, and lengthy reports were not\r\ntranslated, in full, and only salient excerpts were utilized.\r\nApproximately 1,500 documents in the possession of OCC have not yet been\r\ntranslated and more are being received daily. It is expected that they\r\nwill be used for purposes of cross-examination and rebuttal, and may\r\nlater be published.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that these documents are, in the main,\r\ntranslations from the original German. The magnitude of the task,\r\ncoupled with a sense of the hastening on of time, naturally resulted in\r\nimperfections. However, an attempt has been made to preserve the format\r\nof the original documents in the printed translations. Italics represent\r\nunderlining in the original documents and editorial additions have been\r\nenclosed in brackets. The reader may notice occasional variations\r\nbetween the English wording of documents quoted in the essays, and the\r\nfull text of the document itself. This divergence is explained by the\r\nfact that translations of the same documents were sometimes made by two\r\ndifferent persons. Variations in the exact means of expression were of\r\ncourse to be expected in such an event, yet both translations are of\r\nequal authenticity. Certain passages of some documents may strike the\r\nreader as confused or incomplete, and occasionally this is the result of\r\nhasty work. More frequently, however the jumble of language accurately\r\nreflects the chaos of the original German, for the language of National\r\nSocialists was often merely a turgid and mystical aggregation of words\r\nsignifying nothing, to which the German language easily lends itself.\r\nThe accuracy of the translations is attested to in Maj. Coogan’s\r\naffidavit (_001-A-PS_).\r\n\r\nIf the case had not been set down for trial until 1948, a complete and\r\nsatisfactory preparation would have been possible. A perfect case could\r\nnot have been made in less time. But the Allied governments and public\r\nopinion were understandably impatient of delay for whatever reason, and\r\nthey had to be respected. The nature of the difficulties caused by the\r\npressure for speed were stated in Justice Jackson’s address opening the\r\nAmerican case:\r\n\r\n    “In justice to the nations and the men associated in this\r\n    prosecution, I must remind you of certain difficulties which may\r\n    leave their mark on this case. Never before in legal history has\r\n    an effort been made to bring within the scope of a single\r\n    litigation the developments of a decade, covering a whole\r\n    Continent, and involving a score of nations, countless\r\n    individuals, and innumerable events. Despite the magnitude of\r\n    the task, the world has demanded immediate action. This demand\r\n    has had to be met, though perhaps at the cost of finished\r\n    craftsmanship. In my country, established courts, following\r\n    familiar procedures, applying well thumbed precedents, and\r\n    dealing with the legal consequences of local and limited events,\r\n    seldom commence a trial within a year of the event in\r\n    litigation. Yet less than eight months ago today the courtroom\r\n    in which you sit was an enemy fortress in the hands of German SS\r\n    troops. Less than eight months ago nearly all our witnesses and\r\n    documents were in enemy hands. The law had not been codified, no\r\n    procedures had been established, no Tribunal was in existence,\r\n    no usable courthouse stood here, none of the hundreds of tons of\r\n    official German documents had been examined, no prosecuting\r\n    staff had been assembled, nearly all the present defendants were\r\n    at large, and the four prosecuting powers had not yet joined in\r\n    common cause to try them. I should be the last to deny that the\r\n    case may well suffer from incomplete researches and quite likely\r\n    will not be the example of professional work which any of the\r\n    prosecuting nations would normally wish to sponsor. It is,\r\n    however, a completely adequate case to the judgment we shall ask\r\n    you to render, and its full development we shall be obliged to\r\n    leave to historians.”\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nNo work in a specialized field would be complete without its own occult\r\nparaphernalia, and the curious reader may desire an explanation of the\r\nstrange wizardry behind the document classification symbols. The\r\ndocuments in the American series are classified under the cryptic\r\ncategories of “_L_,” “_R_,” “_PS_,” “_EC_,” “_ECH_,” “_ECR_,” and “_C_.”\r\nThe letter “_L_” was used as an abbreviation for “London,” and\r\ndesignates those documents either obtained from American and British\r\nsources in London or processed in the London Office of the OCC, under\r\nthe direction of Col. Murray C. Bernays and Col. Leonard Wheeler, Jr.\r\nThe letter “_R_” stands for “Rothschild,” and indicates the documents\r\nobtained through the screening activities of Lt. Walter Rothschild of\r\nthe London branch of OSS. The origins of the “_PS_” symbol are more\r\nmysterious, but the letters are an abbreviation of the amalgam,\r\n“Paris-Storey.” The “_PS_” symbol, accordingly, denotes those documents\r\nwhich, although obtained in Germany, were processed by Col. Storey’s\r\ndivision of the OCC in Paris, as well as those documents later processed\r\nby the same division after headquarters were established in Nurnberg.\r\nThe “_EC_” symbol stands for “Economic Case” and designates those\r\ndocuments which were obtained and processed by the Economic Section of\r\nOCC under Mr. Francis M. Shea, with field headquarters at Frankfurt. The\r\n“_ECH_” variant denotes those which were screened at Heidelberg. The\r\nletter “_C_,” which is an abbreviation for “Crimes,” indicates a\r\ncollection of German Navy documents which were jointly processed by\r\nBritish and American teams, with Lt. Comdr. John Bracken representing\r\nthe OCC.\r\n\r\nThe British documents hence include some in the joint Anglo-American\r\n“_C_” series. The remainder of the British documents are marked with the\r\nsymbols “_TC_,” “_UK_,” “_D_,” and “_M_.” The symbol “_TC_” is an\r\nabbreviation of “Treaty Committee” and signifies the documents selected\r\nby a Foreign Office Committee which assisted the British prosecution.\r\n“_UK_” is the abbreviation for “United Kingdom” and indicates documents\r\ncollected from another source. No especial significance lurks in the\r\nletters “_D_” and “_M_,” which were apparently the result of accident,\r\npossibly caprice, rather than design. As a matter of record, however,\r\n“_M_” stands for the first name of the British assistant prosecutor.\r\nFinally, “_D_” is merely an humble filing reference, which may have had\r\nsome obscure connection with the word “document.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will note that there are numerous and often lengthy gaps in\r\nthe numbering of documents within a given series, and the documents are\r\nnot numbered in any apparent order. This anomaly is accounted for by\r\nseveral different factors. As the documents avalanched into the OCC\r\noffices they were catalogued and numbered in the order received without\r\nexamination. Upon subsequent analysis it was frequently found that an\r\nearlier document was superseded in quality by a later acquisition, and\r\nthe earlier one was accordingly omitted. Others were withdrawn because\r\nof lack of proof of their authenticity. Occasionally it was discovered\r\nthat two copies of the same document had been received from different\r\nsources, and one of them was accordingly stricken from the list. In\r\nother cases blocks of numbers were assigned to field collecting teams,\r\nwhich failed to exhaust all the numbers allotted. In all these cases no\r\nchange was made in the original numbers because of the delay and\r\nconfusion which would accompany renumbering. Nor has renumbering been\r\nattempted in this publication, and the original gaps remain. This is\r\nbecause the documents introduced into evidence carried their originally\r\nassigned numbers, and students of the trial who use these volumes in\r\nconjunction with the official record will therefore be able to refer\r\nrapidly from citations in the record of the proceedings to the text of\r\nthe documents cited.\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nIt only remains to acknowledge the toil and devotion of the members of\r\nthe OCC staff who were responsible for the original preparation of the\r\nmaterials contained in these volumes. Mention must first be made of Mr.\r\nGordon Dean, who was responsible in large part for the conception of\r\nthis undertaking, and of Lt. Comdr. Charles A. Horsky, USCGR (T) who set\r\nin motion the governmental machinery necessary to publication.\r\n\r\nThe material in Chapter VI on the Organization of the Nazi Party and\r\nState was originally prepared by Mr. Ralph G. Albrecht.\r\n\r\nThe essays in Chapter VII on the Means Used by the Nazi Conspirators in\r\nGaining Control of the German State were originally prepared by Col.\r\nLeonard Wheeler, Jr., Lt. Col.

Loftus Becker, Maj. Paul Neuland, Capt. Walter\r\nRapp, Capt. Seymour Krieger, and Mr. Charles Kruszeawski; with the\r\nassistance of a British staff made jointly available to both the\r\nAmerican and British delegations, consisting of W/Cdr.

George Sayers, RAFVR, S/O Barbara Pinion, WAAF, W/O Mary Carter,\r\nWAAF, and Miss Elizabeth Stewart.\r\n\r\nThe charts reproduced are among those introduced by the prosecution, and\r\nwere designed and executed by presentation specialists assigned to OCC\r\nby the Office of Strategic Services, and headed by David Zablodousky\r\nunder the direction of Comdr. James B. Donovan, USNR.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment must also be made of the very effective labors of the\r\nBritish delegation in preparing those materials in Chapter IX on\r\nAggressive War relating to Aggression as a Basic Nazi Idea, the\r\nViolation of Treaties, and the Aggressions against Poland, Danzig,\r\nEngland and France, Norway and Denmark, the Low Countries, and the\r\nBalkans, as well as the materials in sections on Individual Defendants\r\nrelating to Streicher, Raeder, Doenitz, Neurath, and Ribbentrop.

Phillimore, O.B.E., and Maj. Elwyn Jones, M.P. The\r\nBritish opening address was delivered by the Attorney General and chief\r\nof the British delegation, Sir Hartley Shawcross, K.C., M.P.\r\n\r\nRecognition is also due to Maj. F. Jay Nimitz, Miss Alma Soller, and\r\nMiss Mary Burns, for their loyal and capable assistance in all the\r\nharassing details of compiling, editing and indexing these numerous\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nOne final word should be said in recognition of the financial burden\r\nassumed by the State and War Departments, which have generously joined\r\nin allocating from their budgets the very considerable funds required to\r\nmake this publication possible.\r\n\r\n                                        Roger W.

The common plan or conspiracy embraced the\r\ncommission of Crimes against Peace, in that the defendants planned,\r\nprepared, initiated and waged wars of aggression, which were also wars\r\nin violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances. In the\r\ndevelopment and course of the common plan or conspiracy it came to\r\nembrace the commission of War Crimes, in that it contemplated, and the\r\ndefendants determined upon and carried out, ruthless wars against\r\ncountries and populations, in violation of the rules and customs of war,\r\nincluding as typical and systematic means by which the wars were\r\nprosecuted, murder, ill-treatment, deportation for slave labor and for\r\nother purposes of civilian populations of occupied territories, murder\r\nand ill-treatment of prisoners of war and of persons on the high seas,\r\nthe taking and killing of hostages, the plunder of public and-private\r\nproperty, the wanton destruction of cities, towns, and villages, and\r\ndevastation not justified by military necessity. The common plan or\r\nconspiracy contemplated and came to embrace as typical and systematic\r\nmeans, and the defendants determined upon and committed, Crimes against\r\nHumanity, both within Germany and within occupied territories, including\r\nmurder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts\r\ncommitted against civilian populations before and during the war, and\r\npersecutions on political, racial or religious grounds, in execution of\r\nthe plan for preparing and prosecuting aggressive or illegal wars, many\r\nof such acts and persecutions being violations of the domestic laws of\r\nthe countries where perpetrated.\r\n\r\n  IV. Particulars of the nature and development of the common plan or\r\n                               conspiracy\r\n\r\n (_A_) NAZI PARTY AS THE CENTRAL CORE OF THE COMMON PLAN OR CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\nIn 1921 Adolf Hitler became the supreme leader or Fuehrer of the\r\nNationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist\r\nGerman Workers Party), also known as the Nazi Party, which had been\r\nfounded in Germany in 1920. He continued as such throughout the period\r\ncovered by this Indictment. The Nazi Party, together with certain of its\r\nsubsidiary organizations, became the instrument of cohesion among the\r\ndefendants and their co-conspirators and an instrument for the carrying\r\nout of the aims and purposes of their conspiracy. Each defendant became\r\na member of the Nazi Party and of the conspiracy, with knowledge of\r\ntheir aims and purposes, or, with such knowledge, became an accessory to\r\ntheir aims and purposes at some stage of the development of the\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\n           (_B_) COMMON OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\nThe aims and purposes of the Nazi Party and of the defendants and divers\r\nother persons from time to time associated as leaders, members,\r\nsupporters or adherents of the Nazi Party (hereinafter called\r\ncollectively the “Nazi conspirators”) were, or came to be, to accomplish\r\nthe following by any means deemed opportune, including unlawful means,\r\nand contemplating ultimate resort to threat of force, force and\r\naggressive war: (i) to abrogate and overthrow the Treaty of Versailles\r\nand its restrictions upon the military armament and activity of Germany;\r\n(ii) to acquire the territories lost by Germany as the result of the\r\nWorld War of 1914-1918 and other territories in Europe asserted by the\r\nNazi conspirators to be occupied principally by so-called “racial\r\nGermans”; (iii) to acquire still further territories in continental\r\nEurope and elsewhere claimed by the Nazi conspirators to be required by\r\nthe “racial Germans” as “Lebensraum,” or living space, all at the\r\nexpense of neighboring and other countries. The aims and purposes of the\r\nNazi conspirators were not fixed or static but evolved and expanded as\r\nthey acquired progressively greater power and became able to make more\r\neffective application of threats of force and threats of aggressive war.\r\nWhen their expanding aims and purposes became finally so great as to\r\nprovoke such strength of resistance as could be overthrown only by armed\r\nforce and aggressive war, and not simply by the opportunistic methods\r\ntheretofore used, such as fraud, deceit, threats, intimidation, fifth\r\ncolumn activities and propaganda, the Nazi conspirators deliberately\r\nplanned, determined upon and launched their aggressive wars and wars in\r\nviolation of international treaties, agreements and assurances by the\r\nphases and steps hereinafter more particularly described.\r\n\r\n      (_C_) DOCTRINAL TECHNIQUES OF THE COMMON PLAN OR CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\nTo incite others to join in the common plan or conspiracy, and as a\r\nmeans of securing for the Nazi conspirators the highest degree of\r\ncontrol over the German community, they put forth, disseminated, and\r\nexploited certain doctrines, among others, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. That persons of so-called “German blood” (as specified by the Nazi\r\nconspirators) were a “master race” and were accordingly entitled to\r\nsubjugate, dominate or exterminate other “races” and peoples;\r\n\r\n2. That the German people should be ruled under the Fuehrerprinzip\r\n(leadership principle) according to which power was to reside in a\r\nFuehrer from whom sub-leaders were to derive authority in a hierarchical\r\norder, each sub-leader to owe unconditional obedience to his immediate\r\nsuperior but to be absolute in his own sphere of jurisdiction; and the\r\npower of the leadership was to be unlimited, extending to all phases of\r\npublic and private life;\r\n\r\n3. That war was a noble and necessary activity of Germans;\r\n\r\n4. That the leadership of the Nazi Party, as the sole bearer of the\r\nforegoing and other doctrines of the Nazi Party, was entitled to shape\r\nthe structure, policies and practices of the German State and all\r\nrelated institutions, to direct and supervise the activities of all\r\nindividuals within the State, and to destroy all opponents.\r\n\r\n   (_D_) THE ACQUIRING OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL OF GERMANY: POLITICAL\r\n\r\n1. _First steps in acquisition of control of State machinery_\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish their aims and purposes, the Nazi conspirators\r\nprepared to seize totalitarian control over Germany to assure that no\r\neffective resistance against them could arise within Germany itself.\r\nAfter the failure of the Munich Putsch of 1923 aimed at the overthrow of\r\nthe Weimar Republic by direct action, the Nazi conspirators set out\r\nthrough the Nazi Party to undermine and capture the German Government by\r\n“legal” forms supported by terrorism. They created and utilized, as a\r\nParty formation, Die Sturmabteilungen (SA), a semi-military, voluntary\r\norganization of young men trained for and committed to the use of\r\nviolence, whose mission was to make the Party the master of the streets.\r\n\r\n2. _Control acquired_\r\n\r\nOn 30th January, 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of the German Republic.\r\nAfter the Reichstag fire of 28th February, 1933, clauses of the Weimar\r\nconstitution guaranteeing personal liberty, freedom of speech, of the\r\npress, of association and assembly were suspended. The Nazi conspirators\r\nsecured the passage by the Reichstag of a “Law for the Protection of the\r\nPeople and the Reich” giving Hitler and the members of his then cabinet\r\nplenary powers of legislation. The Nazi conspirators retained such\r\npowers after having changed the members of the cabinet. The conspirators\r\ncaused all political parties except the Nazi Party to be prohibited.\r\nThey caused the Nazi Party to be established as a para-governmental\r\norganization with extensive and extraordinary privileges.\r\n\r\n3. _Consolidation of control_\r\n\r\nThus possessed of the machinery of the German State, the Nazi\r\nconspirators set about the consolidation of their position of power\r\nwithin Germany, the extermination of potential internal resistance and\r\nthe placing of the German nation on a military footing.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Nazi conspirators reduced the Reichstag to a body of their\r\nown nominees and curtailed the freedom of popular elections throughout\r\nthe country. They transformed the several states, provinces and\r\nmunicipalities, which had formerly exercised semi-autonomous powers,\r\ninto hardly more than administrative organs of the central government.\r\nThey united the offices of the President and the Chancellor in the\r\nperson of Hitler; instituted a widespread purge of civil servants; and\r\nseverely restricted the independence of the judiciary and rendered it\r\nsubservient to Nazi ends. The conspirators greatly enlarged existing\r\nState and Party organizations; established a network of new State and\r\nParty organizations; and “co-ordinated” State agencies with the Nazi\r\nParty and its branches and affiliates, with the result that German life\r\nwas dominated by Nazi doctrine and practice and progressively mobilized\r\nfor the accomplishment of their aims.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) In order to make their rule secure from attack and to instil\r\nfear in the hearts of the German people, the Nazi conspirators\r\nestablished and extended a system of terror against opponents and\r\nsupposed or suspected opponents of the regime. They imprisoned such\r\npersons without judicial process, holding them in “protective custody”\r\nand concentration camps, and subjected them to persecution, degradation,\r\ndespoilment enslavement, torture and murder. These concentration camps\r\nwere established early in 1933 under the direction of the defendant\r\nGOERING and expanded as a fixed part of the terroristic policy and\r\nmethod of the conspirators and used by them for the commission of the\r\nCrimes against Humanity hereinafter alleged. Among the principal\r\nagencies utilized in the perpetration of these crimes were the SS and\r\nthe GESTAPO, which, together with other favored branches or agencies of\r\nthe State and Party, were permitted to operate without restraint of law.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The Nazi conspirators conceived that, in addition to the\r\nsuppression of distinctively political opposition, it was necessary to\r\nsuppress or exterminate certain other movements or groups which they\r\nregarded as obstacles to their retention of total control in Germany and\r\nto the aggressive aims of the conspiracy abroad. Accordingly:\r\n\r\n    (1) The Nazi conspirators destroyed the free trade unions in\r\n    Germany by confiscating their funds and properties, persecuting\r\n    their leaders, prohibiting their activities, and supplanting\r\n    them by an affiliated Party organization. The leadership\r\n    principle was introduced into industrial relations, the\r\n    entrepreneur becoming the leader and the workers becoming his\r\n    followers. Thus any potential resistance of the workers was\r\n    frustrated and the productive labor capacity of the German\r\n    nation was brought under the effective control of the\r\n    conspirators.\r\n\r\n    (2) The Nazi conspirators, by promoting beliefs and practices\r\n    incompatible with Christian teaching, sought to subvert the\r\n    influence of the Churches over the people and in particular over\r\n    the youth of Germany. They avowed their aim to eliminate the\r\n    Christian Churches in Germany and sought to substitute therefor\r\n    Nazi institutions and Nazi beliefs and pursued a programme of\r\n    persecution of priests, clergy and members of monastic orders\r\n    whom they deemed opposed to their purposes and confiscated\r\n    church property.\r\n\r\n    (3) The persecution by the Nazi conspirators of pacifist groups,\r\n    including religious movements dedicated to pacifism, was\r\n    particularly relentless and cruel.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Implementing their “master race” policy, the conspirators\r\njoined in a program of relentless persecution of the Jews, designed to\r\nexterminate them. Annihilation of the Jews became an official State\r\npolicy, carried out both by official action and by incitements to mob\r\nand individual violence. The conspirators openly avowed their purpose.\r\nFor example, the defendant ROSENBERG stated: “Anti-Semitism is the\r\nunifying element of the reconstruction of Germany.” On another occasion\r\nhe also stated: “Germany will regard, the Jewish question as solved only\r\nafter the very last Jew has left the greater German living space . . .\r\nEurope will have its Jewish question solved only after the very last Jew\r\nhas left the Continent.” The defendant LEY declared: “We swear we are\r\nnot going to abandon the struggle until the last Jew in Europe has been\r\nexterminated and is actually dead. It is not enough to isolate the\r\nJewish enemy of mankind—the Jew has got to be exterminated.” On another\r\noccasion he also declared: “The second German secret weapon is\r\nanti-Semitism because if it is consistently pursued by Germany, it will\r\nbecome a universal problem which all nations will be forced to\r\nconsider.” The defendant STREICHER declared: “The sun will not shine on\r\nthe nations of the earth until the last Jew is dead.” These avowals and\r\nincitements were typical of the declarations of the Nazi conspirators\r\nthroughout the course of their conspiracy. The program of action against\r\nthe Jews included disfranchisement, stigmatization, denial of civil\r\nrights, subjecting their persons and property to violence, deportation,\r\nenslavement, enforced labor, starvation, murder and mass extermination.\r\nThe extent to which the conspirators succeeded in their purpose can only\r\nbe estimated, but the annihilation was substantially complete in many\r\nlocalities of Europe. Of the 9,600,000 Jews who lived in the parts of\r\nEurope under Nazi domination, it is conservatively estimated that\r\n5,700,000 have disappeared, most of them deliberately put to death by\r\nthe Nazi conspirators. Only remnants of the Jewish population of Europe\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) In order to make the German people amenable to their will, and\r\nto prepare them psychologically for war, the Nazi conspirators reshaped\r\nthe educational system and particularly the education and training of\r\nthe German youth. The leadership principle was introduced into the\r\nschools and the Party and affiliated organizations were given wide\r\nsupervisory powers over education. The Nazi conspirators imposed a\r\nsupervision of all cultural activities, controlled the dissemination of\r\ninformation and the expression of opinion within Germany as well as the\r\nmovement of intelligence of all kinds from and into Germany, and created\r\nvast propaganda machines.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) The Nazi conspirators placed a considerable number of their\r\ndominated organizations on a progressively militarized footing with a\r\nview to the rapid transformation and use of such organizations whenever\r\nnecessary as instruments of war.\r\n\r\n (_E_) THE ACQUIRING OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL IN GERMANY: ECONOMIC; AND\r\n       THE ECONOMIC PLANNING AND MOBILIZATION FOR AGGRESSIVE WAR\r\n\r\nHaving gained political power the conspirators organized Germany’s\r\neconomy to give effect to their political aims.\r\n\r\n1. In order to eliminate the possibility of resistance in the economic\r\nsphere, they deprived labour of its rights of free industrial and\r\npolitical association as particularized in paragraph (_D_) 3 (_c_) (1)\r\nherein.\r\n\r\n2. They used organizations of German business as instruments of economic\r\nmobilization for war.\r\n\r\n3. They directed Germany’s economy towards preparation and equipment of\r\nthe military machine. To this end they directed finance, capital\r\ninvestment, and foreign trade.\r\n\r\n4. The Nazi conspirators, and in particular the industrialists among\r\nthem, embarked upon a huge rearmament programme and set out to produce\r\nand develop huge quantities of materials of war and to create a powerful\r\nmilitary potential.\r\n\r\n5. With the object of carrying through the preparation for war the Nazi\r\nconspirators, set up a series of administrative agencies and\r\nauthorities. For example, in 1936 they established for this purpose the\r\noffice of the Four Year Plan with the defendant GOERING as\r\nPlenipotentiary, vesting it with overriding control over Germany’s\r\neconomy. Furthermore, on 28th August, 1939, immediately before launching\r\ntheir aggression against Poland, they appointed the defendant FUNK\r\nPlenipotentiary for Economics; and on 30th August, 1939, they set up the\r\nMinisterial Council for the Defence of the Reich to act as a War\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\n        (_F_) UTILIZATION OF NAZI CONTROL FOR FOREIGN AGGRESSION\r\n\r\n1. _Status of the conspiracy by the middle of 1933 and projected plans._\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the year 1933 the Nazi conspirators, having acquired\r\ngovernmental control over Germany, were in a position to enter upon\r\nfurther and more detailed planning with particular relationship to\r\nforeign policy. Their plan was to rearm and to re-occupy and fortify the\r\nRhineland, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties,\r\nin order to acquire military strength and political bargaining power to\r\nbe used against other nations.\r\n\r\n2. The Nazi conspirators decided that for their purpose the Treaty of\r\nVersailles must definitely be abrogated and specific plans were made by\r\nthem and put into operation by 7th March, 1936, all of which opened the\r\nway for the major aggressive steps to follow, as hereinafter set forth.\r\nIn the execution of this phase of the conspiracy the Nazi conspirators\r\ndid the following acts:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) They led Germany to enter upon a course of secret rearmament\r\nfrom 1933 to March, 1935, including the training of military personnel\r\nand the production of munitions of war, and the building of an air\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) On 14th October, 1933, they led Germany to leave the\r\nInternational Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) On 10th March, 1935, the defendant GOERING announced that\r\nGermany was building a military air force.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) On 16th March, 1935, the Nazi conspirators promulgated a law\r\nfor universal military service, in which they stated the peace-time\r\nstrength of the German Army would be fixed at 500,000 men.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) On 21st May, 1935, they falsely announced to the world, with\r\nintent to deceive and allay fears of aggressive intentions, that they\r\nwould respect the territorial limitations of the Versailles Treaty and\r\ncomply with the Locarno Pacts.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) On 7th March, 1936, they reoccupied and fortified the\r\nRhineland, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Rhine Pact\r\nof Locarno of 16th October, 1925, and falsely announced to the world\r\nthat “we have no territorial demands to make in Europe.”\r\n\r\n3. _Aggressive action against Austria and Czechoslovakia_\r\n\r\n    (_a_) _The 1936-1938 phase of the plan: planning for the assault on\r\nAustria and Czechoslovakia_\r\n\r\n    The Nazi conspirators next entered upon the specific planning\r\n    for the acquisition of Austria and Czechoslovakia, realizing it\r\n    would be necessary, for military reasons, first to seize Austria\r\n    before assaulting Czechoslovakia. On 21st May, 1935, in a speech\r\n    to the Reichstag, Hitler stated that: “Germany neither intends\r\n    nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria, to\r\n    annex Austria or to conclude an Anschluss.” On 1st May, 1936,\r\n    within two months after the reoccupation of the Rhineland,\r\n    Hitler stated: “The lie goes forth again that Germany tomorrow\r\n    or the day after will fall upon Austria or Czechoslovakia.”\r\n    Thereafter, the Nazi conspirators caused a treaty to be entered\r\n    into between Austria and Germany on 11th July, 1936, Article 1\r\n    of which stated that “The German Government recognizes the full\r\n    sovereignty of the Federated State of Austria in the spirit of\r\n    the pronouncements of the German Fuehrer and Chancellor of 21st\r\n    May, 1935.” Meanwhile, plans for aggression in violation of that\r\n    treaty were being made. By the autumn of 1937, all noteworthy\r\n    opposition within the Reich had been crushed. Military\r\n    preparation for the Austrian action was virtually concluded. An\r\n    influential group of the Nazi conspirators met with Hitler on\r\n    5th November, 1937, to review the situation. It was reaffirmed\r\n    that Nazi Germany must have “Lebensraum” in central Europe. It\r\n    was recognized that such conquest would probably meet resistance\r\n    which would have to be crushed by force and that their decision\r\n    might lead to a general war, but this prospect was discounted as\r\n    a risk worth taking. There emerged from this meeting three\r\n    possible plans for the conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia.\r\n    Which of the three was to be used was to depend upon the\r\n    developments in the political and military situation in Europe.\r\n    It was contemplated that the conquest of Austria and\r\n    Czechoslovakia would, through compulsory emigration of 2,000,000\r\n    persons from Czechoslovakia and 1,000,000 persons from Austria,\r\n    provide additional food to the Reich for 5,000,000 to 6,000,000\r\n    people, strengthen it militarily by providing shorter and better\r\n    frontiers, and make possible the constituting of new armies up\r\n    to about twelve divisions. Thus, the aim of the plan against\r\n    Austria and Czechoslovakia was conceived of not as an end to\r\n    itself but as a preparatory measure toward the next aggressive\r\n    steps in the Nazi conspiracy.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) _The execution of the plan to invade Austria: November, 1937,\r\nto March, 1938_\r\n\r\n    Hitler on 8th February, 1938, called Chancellor Schuschnigg to a\r\n    conference at Berchtesgaden. At the meeting of 12th February,\r\n    1938, under threat of invasion, Schuschnigg yielded a promise of\r\n    amnesty to imprisoned Nazis and appointment of Nazis to\r\n    ministerial posts. He agreed to remain silent until Hitler’s\r\n    20th February speech in which Austria’s independence was to be\r\n    reaffirmed, but Hitler in his speech, instead of affirming\r\n    Austrian independence, declared himself protector of all\r\n    Germans. Meanwhile, subversive activities of Nazis in Austria\r\n    increased. Schuschnigg on 9th March, 1938, announced a\r\n    plebiscite for the following Sunday on the question of Austrian\r\n    independence. On 11th March Hitler sent an ultimatum, demanding\r\n    that the plebiscite be called off or that Germany would invade\r\n    Austria. Later the same day a second ultimatum threatened\r\n    invasion unless Schuschnigg should resign in three hours.\r\n    Schuschnigg resigned. The defendant SEYSS-INQUART, who was\r\n    appointed Chancellor, immediately invited Hitler to send German\r\n    troops into Austria to “preserve order.” The invasion began on\r\n    12th March, 1938. On 13th March, Hitler by proclamation assumed\r\n    office as Chief of State of Austria and took command of its\r\n    armed forces. By a law of the same date Austria was annexed to\r\n    Germany.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) _The execution of the plan to invade Czechoslovakia: April,\r\n1938, to March, 1939_\r\n\r\n    1. Simultaneously with their annexation of Austria the Nazi\r\n    conspirators gave false assurances to the Czechoslovak\r\n    Government that they would not attack that country. But within a\r\n    month they met to plan specific ways and means of attacking\r\n    Czechoslovakia, and to revise, in the light of the acquisition\r\n    of Austria, the previous plans for aggression against\r\n    Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\n    2. On 21st April, 1938, the Nazi conspirators met and prepared\r\n    to launch an attack on Czechoslovakia not later than 1st\r\n    October, 1938. They planned specifically to create an “incident”\r\n    to “justify” the attack. They decided to launch a military\r\n    attack only after a period of diplomatic squabbling which,\r\n    growing more serious, would lead to the excuse for war, or, in\r\n    the alternative, to unleash a lightning attack as a result of an\r\n    “incident” of their own creation. Consideration was given to\r\n    assassinating the German Ambassador at Prague to create the\r\n    requisite incident. From and after 21st April, 1938, the Nazi\r\n    conspirators caused to be prepared detailed and precise military\r\n    plans designed to carry out such an attack at any opportune\r\n    moment and calculated to overcome all Czechoslovak, resistance\r\n    within four days, thus presenting the world with a fait\r\n    accompli, and so forestalling outside resistance. Throughout the\r\n    months of May, June, July, August and September, these plans\r\n    were made more specific and detailed, and by 3rd September,\r\n    1938, it was decided that all troops were to be ready for action\r\n    on 28th September, 1938.\r\n\r\n    3. Throughout this same period, the Nazi conspirators were\r\n    agitating the minorities question in Czechoslovakia, and\r\n    particularly in the Sudetenland, leading to a diplomatic crisis\r\n    in August and September, 1938. After the Nazi conspirators\r\n    threatened war, the United Kingdom and France concluded a pact\r\n    with Germany and Italy at Munich on 29th September, 1938,\r\n    involving the cession of the Sudetenland by Czechoslovakia to\r\n    Germany. Czechoslovakia was required to acquiesce. On 1st\r\n    October, 1938, German troops occupied the Sudetenland.\r\n\r\n    4. On 15th March, 1939, contrary to the provisions of the Munich\r\n    Pact itself, the Nazi conspirators caused the completion of\r\n    their plan by seizing and occupying the major part of\r\n    Czechoslovakia not ceded to Germany by the Munich Pact.\r\n\r\n4. _Formulation of the plan to attack Poland_: _preparation and\r\ninitiation of aggressive war_: _March, 1939, to September, 1939_\r\n\r\n    (_a_) With these aggressions successfully consummated, the\r\nconspirators had obtained much desired resources and bases and were\r\nready to undertake further aggressions by means of war. Following\r\nassurances to the world of peaceful intentions, an influential group of\r\nthe conspirators met on 23rd May, 1939, to consider the further\r\nimplementation of their plan. The situation was reviewed and it was\r\nobserved that “the past six years have been put to good use and all\r\nmeasures have been taken in correct sequence and in accordance with our\r\naims”; that the national-political unity of the Germans had been\r\nsubstantially achieved; and that further successes could not be achieved\r\nwithout war and bloodshed. It was decided nevertheless next to attack\r\nPoland at the first suitable opportunity. It was admitted that the\r\nquestions concerning Danzig which they had agitated with Poland were not\r\ntrue questions, but rather that the question was one of aggressive\r\nexpansion for food and “Lebensraum.” It was recognized that Poland would\r\nfight if attacked and that a repetition of the Nazi success against\r\nCzechoslovakia without war could not be expected. Accordingly, it was\r\ndetermined that the problem was to isolate Poland and, if possible,\r\nprevent a simultaneous conflict with the Western Powers. Nevertheless,\r\nit was agreed that England was an enemy to their aspirations, and that\r\nwar with England and her ally France must eventually result, and\r\ntherefore that in that war every attempt must be made to overwhelm\r\nEngland with a “Blitzkrieg.” It was thereupon determined immediately to\r\nprepare detailed plans for an attack on Poland at the first suitable\r\nopportunity and thereafter for an attack on England and France, together\r\nwith plans for the simultaneous occupation by armed force of air bases\r\nin the Netherlands and Belgium.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Accordingly, after having denounced the German-Polish Pact of\r\n1934 on false grounds, the Nazi conspirators proceeded to stir up the\r\nDanzig issue to prepare frontier “incidents” to “justify” the attack,\r\nand to make demands for the cession of Polish territory. Upon refusal by\r\nPoland to yield, they caused German armed forces to invade Poland on 1st\r\nSeptember, 1939, thus precipitating war also with the United Kingdom and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n5. _Expansion of the war into a general war of aggression: planning and\r\nexecution of attacks on Denmark, Norway, Belgium, The Netherlands,\r\nLuxembourg, Yugoslavia, and Greece: 1939 to April, 1941_\r\n\r\nThus the aggressive war prepared for by the Nazi conspirators through\r\ntheir attacks on Austria and Czechoslovakia was actively launched by\r\ntheir attack on Poland, in violation of the terms of the Briand-Kellogg\r\nPact, 1928. After the total defeat of Poland, in order to facilitate the\r\ncarrying out of their military operations against France and the United\r\nKingdom, the Nazi conspirators made active preparations for an extension\r\nof the war in Europe. In accordance with those plans, they caused the\r\nGerman armed forces to invade Denmark and Norway on 9th April, 1940;\r\nBelgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg on 10th May, 1940; Yugoslavia\r\nand Greece on 6th April, 1941. All these invasions had been specifically\r\nplanned in advance.\r\n\r\n6. _German invasion on June 22nd, 1941, of the U.S.S.R. territory in\r\nviolation of Non-Aggression Pact of 23rd August, 1939_\r\n\r\nOn June 22nd, 1941, the Nazi conspirators deceitfully denounced the\r\nNon-Aggression Pact between Germany and the U.S.S.R. and without any\r\ndeclaration of war invaded Soviet territory thereby beginning a War of\r\nAggression against the U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\nFrom the first day of launching their attack on Soviet territory the\r\nNazi conspirators, in accordance with their detailed plans, began to\r\ncarry out the destruction of cities, towns and villages, the demolition\r\nof factories, collective farms, electric stations and railroads, the\r\nrobbery and barbaric devastation of the natural cultural institutions of\r\nthe peoples of the U.S.S.R., the devastation of museums, churches,\r\nhistoric monuments. The mass deportation of the Soviet citizens for\r\nslave labor to Germany, as well as the annihilation of old people, women\r\nand children, especially Belo-Russians and Ukrainians. The extermination\r\nof Jews committed throughout the territory of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned criminal offenses were perpetrated by the German\r\ntroops in accordance with the orders of the Nazi Government and the\r\nGeneral Staff and High Command of the German armed forces.\r\n\r\n7. _Collaboration with Italy and Japan and aggressive war against the\r\nUnited States: November, 1936, to December, 1941_\r\n\r\nAfter the initiation of the Nazi wars of aggression the Nazi\r\nconspirators brought about a German-Italian-Japanese ten-year\r\nmilitary-economic alliance signed at Berlin on 27th September, 1940.\r\nThis agreement, representing a strengthening of the bonds among those\r\nthree nations established by the earlier but more limited pact of 25th\r\nNovember, 1936, stated: “The Governments of Germany, Italy and Japan,\r\nconsidering it as a condition precedent of any lasting peace that all\r\nnations of the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to\r\nstand by and co-operate with one another in regard of their efforts in\r\nGreater East Asia and regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their\r\nprime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things calculated\r\nto promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned.”\r\nThe Nazi conspirators conceived that Japanese aggression would weaken\r\nand handicap those nations with whom they were at war, and those with\r\nwhom they contemplated war. Accordingly, the Nazi conspirators exhorted\r\nJapan to seek “a new order of things.” Taking advantage of the wars of\r\naggression then being waged by the Nazi conspirators, Japan commenced an\r\nattack on 7th December, 1941, against the United States of America at\r\nPearl Harbor and the Philippines, and against the British Commonwealth\r\nof Nations, French Indo-China and the Netherlands in the southwest\r\nPacific. Germany declared war against the United States on 11th\r\nDecember, 1941.\r\n\r\n(_G_) WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY COMMITTED IN THE COURSE OF\r\n  EXECUTING THE CONSPIRACY FOR WHICH THE CONSPIRATORS ARE RESPONSIBLE\r\n\r\n1. Beginning with the initiation of the aggressive war on 1st September,\r\n1939, and throughout its extension into wars involving almost the entire\r\nworld, the Nazi conspirators carried out their common plan or conspiracy\r\nto wage war in ruthless and complete disregard and violation of the laws\r\nand customs of war. In the course of executing the common plan or\r\nconspiracy there were committed the War Crimes detailed hereinafter in\r\nCount Three of this Indictment.\r\n\r\n2. Beginning with the initiation of their plan to seize and retain total\r\ncontrol of the German State, and thereafter throughout their utilization\r\nof that control for foreign aggression, the Nazi conspirators carried\r\nout their common plan or conspiracy in ruthless and complete disregard\r\nand violation of the laws of humanity. In the course of executing the\r\ncommon plan or conspiracy there were committed the Crimes against\r\nHumanity detailed hereinafter in Count Four of this Indictment.\r\n\r\n3. By reason of all the foregoing, the defendants with divers other\r\npersons are guilty of a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment\r\nof Crimes against Peace; of a conspiracy to commit Crimes against\r\nHumanity in the course of preparation for war and in the course of\r\nprosecution of war; and of a conspiracy to commit War Crimes not only\r\nagainst the armed forces of their enemies but also against\r\nnon-belligerent civilian populations.\r\n\r\n(_H_) INDIVIDUAL, GROUP AND ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OFFENSE\r\n                          STATED IN COUNT ONE\r\n\r\nReference is hereby, made to Appendix A of this Indictment for a\r\nstatement of the responsibility, of the individual defendants for the\r\noffense set forth in this Count One of the Indictment.

Statement of the Offense\r\n\r\nAll the defendants committed War Crimes between 1st September, 1939, and\r\n8th May, 1945, in Germany and in all those countries and territories\r\noccupied by the German armed forces since 1st September, 1939, and in\r\nAustria, Czechoslovakia, and Italy, and on the High Seas.\r\n\r\nAll the defendants, acting in concert with others, formulated and\r\nexecuted a common plan or conspiracy to commit War Crimes as defined in\r\nArticle 6 (_b_) of the Charter. This plan involved, among other things,\r\nthe practice of “total war” including methods of combat and of military\r\noccupation in direct conflict with the laws and customs of war, and the\r\ncommission of crimes perpetrated on the field of battle during\r\nencounters with enemy armies, and against prisoners of war, and in\r\noccupied territories against the civilian population of such\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nThe said War Crimes were committed by the defendants and by other\r\npersons for whose acts the defendants are responsible (under Article 6\r\nof the Charter) as such other persons when committing the said War\r\nCrimes performed their acts in execution of a common plan and conspiracy\r\nto commit the said War Crimes, in the formulation and execution of which\r\nplan and conspiracy all the defendants participated as leaders,\r\norganizers, instigators and accomplices.\r\n\r\nThese methods and crimes constituted violations of international\r\nconventions, of internal penal laws and of the general principles of\r\ncriminal law as derived from the criminal law of all civilized nations,\r\nand were involved in and part of a systematic course of conduct.\r\n\r\n(_A_) MURDER AND ILL-TREATMENT OF CIVILIAN POPULATIONS OF OR IN OCCUPIED\r\n                     TERRITORY AND ON THE HIGH SEAS\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of their occupation of territories overrun by\r\ntheir armed forces the defendants, for the purpose of systematically\r\nterrorizing the inhabitants, murdered and tortured civilians, and\r\nill-treated them, and imprisoned them without legal process.\r\n\r\nThe murders and ill-treatment were carried out by divers means,\r\nincluding shooting, hanging, gassing, starvation, gross overcrowding,\r\nsystematic under-nutrition, systematic imposition of labor tasks beyond\r\nthe strength of those ordered to carry them out, inadequate provision of\r\nsurgical and medical services, kickings, beatings, brutality and torture\r\nof all kinds, including the use of hot irons and pulling out of\r\nfingernails and the performance of experiments by means of operations\r\nand otherwise on living human subjects. In some occupied territories the\r\ndefendants interfered with religious services, persecuted members of the\r\nclergy and monastic orders, and expropriated church property. They\r\nconducted deliberate and systematic genocide, viz., the extermination of\r\nracial and national groups, against the civilian populations of certain\r\noccupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of\r\npeople and national, racial or religious groups, particularly Jews,\r\nPoles and Gypsies and others.\r\n\r\nCivilians were systematically subjected to tortures of all kinds, with\r\nthe object of obtaining information.\r\n\r\nCivilians of occupied countries were subjected systematically to\r\n“protective arrests” whereby they were arrested and imprisoned without\r\nany trial and any of the ordinary protections of the law, and they were\r\nimprisoned under the most unhealthy and inhumane conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the concentration camps were many prisoners who were classified\r\n“Nacht und Nebel”. These were entirely cut off from the world and were\r\nallowed neither to receive nor to send letters. They disappeared without\r\ntrace and no announcement of their fate was ever made by the German\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nSuch murders and ill-treatment were contrary to International\r\nConventions, in particular to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations, 1907,\r\nthe laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as\r\nderived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal\r\npenal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and to\r\nArticle 6 (_b_) of the Charter.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars and all the particulars appearing later in\r\nthis count are set out herein by way of example only, are not exclusive\r\nof other particular cases, and are stated without prejudice to the right\r\nof the Prosecution to adduce evidence of other cases of murder and\r\nill-treatment of civilians.\r\n\r\n1. _In France, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Norway, Luxembourg, Italy and\r\nthe Channel Islands (hereinafter called the “Western Countries”) and in\r\nthat part of Germany which lies west of a line drawn due North and South\r\nthrough the centre of Berlin (hereinafter called “Western Germany”)._\r\n\r\nSuch murder and ill-treatment took place in concentration camps and\r\nsimilar establishments set up by the defendants and particularly in the\r\nconcentration camps set up at Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau, Breendonck,\r\nGrini, Natzweiler, Ravensbruck, Vught and Amersfoort, and in numerous\r\ncities, towns and villages, including Oradour sur Glane, Trondheim and\r\nOslo.\r\n\r\nCrimes committed in France or against French citizens took the following\r\nforms:—\r\n\r\nArbitrary arrests were carried out under political or racial pretexts;\r\nthey were both individual and collective; notably in Paris (round-up of\r\nthe 18th Arrondissement by the Field Gendarmerie, round-up of the Jewish\r\npopulation of the 11th Arrondissement in August, 1941, round-up of\r\nJewish intellectuals in December, 1941, round-up in July, 1942); at\r\nClermont-Ferrand, (round-up of professors and students of the University\r\nof Strasbourg, who were taken to Clermon-Ferrand[Clermont-Ferrand?] on\r\n25th November, 1943); at Lyons; at Marseilles (round-up of 40,000\r\npersons in January, 1943); at Grenoble (round-up on 24th December,\r\n1943); at Cluny (round-up on 24th December, 1944); at Figeac (round-up\r\nin May, 1944); at Saint Pol de Leon (round-up in July, 1944); at Locminé\r\n(round-up on 3rd July, 1944); at Eyzieux (round-up in May, 1944) and at\r\nMoussey (round-up in September, 1944). These arrests were followed by\r\nbrutal treatment and tortures carried out by the most diverse methods,\r\nsuch as immersion in icy water, asphyxiation, torture of the limbs, and\r\nthe use of instruments of torture, such as the iron helmet and electric\r\ncurrent, and practised in all the prisons of France, notably in Paris,\r\nLyons, Marseilles, Rennes, Metz, Clermont-Ferrand, Toulouse, Nice,\r\nGrenoble, Annecy, Arras, Bethune, Lille, Loos, Valenciennes, Nancy,\r\nTroyes and Caen, and in the torture chambers fitted up at the Gestapo\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\nIn the concentration camps, the health regime, and the labour regime,\r\nwere such that the rate of mortality (alleged to be from natural causes)\r\nattained enormous proportions, for instance:—\r\n\r\n      1. Out of a convoy of 230 French women deported from Compiegne to\r\nAuschwitz in January, 1943, 180 died of exhaustion by the end of four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n      2. 143 Frenchmen died of exhaustion between 23rd March and 6th\r\nMay, 1943, in Block 8 at Dachau.\r\n\r\n      3. 1,797 Frenchmen died of exhaustion between 21st November, 1943,\r\nand 15th March, 1945, in the Block at Dora.\r\n\r\n      4. 465 Frenchmen died of general debility in November, 1944, at\r\nDora.\r\n\r\n      5. 22,761 deportees died of exhaustion at Buchenwald between 1st\r\nJanuary, 1943, and 15th April, 1945.\r\n\r\n      6. 11,560 detainees died of exhaustion at Dachau Camp (most of\r\nthem in Block 30 reserved for the sick and infirm) between 1st January\r\nand 15th April, 1945.\r\n\r\n      7. 780 priests died of exhaustion at Mauthausen.\r\n\r\n      8. Out of 2,200 Frenchmen registered at Flossenburg Camp, 1,600\r\ndied from supposedly natural causes.\r\n\r\nMethods used for the work of extermination in concentration camps\r\nwere:—bad treatment, pseudo-scientific experiments (sterilization of\r\nwomen at Auschwitz and at Ravensbruck, study of the evolution of cancer\r\nof the womb at Auschwitz, of typhus at Buchenwald, anatomical research\r\nat Natzweiller, heart injections at Buchenwald, bone grafting and\r\nmuscular excisions at Ravensbruck, etc.), gas-chambers, gas-wagons and\r\ncrematory ovens. Of 228,000 French political and racial deportees in\r\nconcentration camps, only 28,000 survived.\r\n\r\nIn France also systematic extermination was practised, notably at Asq on\r\n1st April, 1944, at Colpo on 22nd July, 1944, at Buzet sur Tarn on 6th\r\nJuly, 1944 and on 17th August, 1944, at Pluvignier on 8th July, 1944, at\r\nRennes on 8th June, 1944, at Grenoble on 8th July, 1944, at Saint Flour\r\non 10th June, 1944, at Ruisnes on 10th July, 1944, at Nimes, at Tulle,\r\nand at Nice, where, in July, 1944, the victims of torture were exposed\r\nto the population, and at Oradour sur Glane where the entire village\r\npopulation was shot or burned alive in the church.\r\n\r\nThe many charnel pits give proof of anonymous massacres. Most notable of\r\nthese are the charnel pits of Paris (Cascade du Bois de Boulogne),\r\nLyons, Saint Genies Laval, Besancon, Petit Saint Bernard, Aulnat, Caen,\r\nPort Louis, Charleval, Fontainebleau, Bouconne, Gabaudet, L’hermitage,\r\nLorges, Morlaas, Bordelongue, Signe.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a premeditated campaign of terrorism, initiated in\r\nDenmark by the Germans in the latter part of 1943, 600 Danish subjects\r\nwere murdered and, in addition, throughout the German occupation of\r\nDenmark, large numbers of Danish subjects were subjected to torture and\r\nill-treatment of all sorts. In addition, approximately 500 Danish\r\nsubjects were murdered, by torture and otherwise, in German prisons and\r\nconcentration camps.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium between 1940 and 1944 tortures by various means, but\r\nidentical in each place, were carried out at Brussels, Liege, Mons,\r\nGhent, Namur, Antwerp, Tournai, Arlon, Charleroi and Dinant.\r\n\r\nAt Vught, in Holland, when the camp was evacuated about 400 persons were\r\nmurdered by shooting.\r\n\r\nIn Luxembourg, during the German occupation, 500 persons were murdered\r\nand, in addition, another 521 were illegally executed, by order of such\r\nspecial tribunals as the so-called “Sondergericht”. Many more persons in\r\nLuxembourg were subjected to torture and mistreatment by the Gestapo.\r\nNot less than 4,000 Luxembourg nationals were imprisoned during the\r\nperiod of German occupation, and of these at least 400 were murdered.\r\n\r\nBetween March, 1944, and April, 1945, in Italy, at least 7,500 men,\r\nwomen and children, ranging in years from infancy to extreme old age\r\nwere murdered by the German soldiery at Civitella, in the Ardeatine\r\nCaves in Rome, and at other places.\r\n\r\n2. _In the U.S.S.R., i.e., in the Bielorussian, Ukrainian, Esthonian,\r\nLatvian, Lithuanian, Karelo-Finnish, and Moldavian Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics, in 19 regions of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist\r\nRepublic, and in Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the\r\nBalkans (hereinafter called “the Eastern Countries”) and in that part of\r\nGermany which lies East of a line drawn North and South through the\r\ncentre of Berlin (hereinafter called “Eastern Germany”)._\r\n\r\nFrom the 1st September, 1939, when the German armed forces invaded\r\nPoland, and from the 22nd June, 1941, when they invaded the U.S.S.R.,\r\nthe German Government and the German High Command adopted a systematic\r\npolicy of murder and ill-treatment of the civilian populations of and in\r\nthe Eastern Countries as they were successively occupied by the German\r\narmed forces. These murders and ill-treatments were carried on\r\ncontinuously until the German Armed Forces were driven out of the said\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nSuch murders and ill-treatments included:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) Murders and ill-treatments at concentration camps and similar\r\nestablishments set up by the Germans in the Eastern Countries and in\r\nEastern Germany including those set up at Maidanek and Auschwitz.\r\n\r\nThe said murders and ill-treatments were carried out by divers means\r\nincluding all those set out above, as follows:\r\n\r\nAbout 1,500,000 persons were exterminated in Maidanek and about\r\n4,000,000 persons were exterminated in Auschwitz, among whom were\r\ncitizens of Poland, the U.S.S.R., the United States of America, Great\r\nBritain, Czechoslovakia, France and other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the Lwow region and in the city of Lwow the Germans exterminated\r\nabout 700,000 Soviet people, including 70 persons in the field of the\r\narts, science and technology, and also citizens of the U. S. A., Great\r\nBritain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Holland, brought to this region\r\nfrom other concentration camps.\r\n\r\nIn the Jewish ghetto from 7th September, 1941, to 6th July, 1943, over\r\n133,000 persons were tortured and shot.\r\n\r\nMass shooting of the population occurred in the suburbs of the city and\r\nin the Livenitz forest.\r\n\r\nIn the Ganov camp 200,000 peaceful citizens were exterminated. The most\r\nrefined methods of cruelty were employed in this extermination, such as\r\ndisembowelling and the freezing of human beings in tubs of water. Mass\r\nshootings took place to the accompaniment of the music of an orchestra\r\nrecruited from the persons interned.\r\n\r\nBeginning with June, 1943, the Germans carried out measures to hide the\r\nevidence of their crimes. They exhumed and burned corpses, and they\r\ncrushed the bones with machines and used them for fertilizer.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1944 in the Ozarichi region of the Bielorussian\r\nS.S.R., before liberation by the Red Army, the Germans established three\r\nconcentration camps without shelters, to which they committed tens of\r\nthousands of persons from the neighbouring territories. They brought\r\nmany people to these camps from typhus hospitals intentionally, for the\r\npurpose of infecting the other persons interned and for spreading the\r\ndisease in territories from which the Germans were being driven by the\r\nRed Army. In these camps there were many murders and crimes.\r\n\r\nIn the Esthonian S.S.R. they shot tens of thousands of persons and in\r\none day alone, 19th September, 1944, in Camp Kloga, the Germans shot\r\n2,000 peaceful citizens. They burned the bodies on bonfires.\r\n\r\nIn the Lithuanian S.S.R. there were mass killings of Soviet citizens,\r\nnamely: in Panerai at least 100,000; in Kaunas more than 70,000; in\r\nAlitus about 60,000; at Prenai more than 3,000; in Villiampol about\r\n8,000; in Mariampol about 7,000; in Trakai and neighbouring towns\r\n37,640.\r\n\r\nIn the Latvian S.S.R. 577,000 persons were murdered.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the whole system of internal order maintained in all\r\ncamps, the interned persons were doomed to die.\r\n\r\nIn a secret instruction entitled “the internal regime in concentration\r\ncamps”, signed personally by Himmler in 1941 severe measures of\r\npunishment were set forth for the internees. Masses of prisoners of war\r\nwere shot, or died from the cold and torture.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Murders and ill-treatments at places in the Eastern Countries and\r\nin the Soviet Union, other than in the camps referred to in (_a_) above,\r\nincluded, on various dates during the occupation by the German Armed\r\nForces:\r\n\r\nThe destruction in the Smolenck region of over 135,000 Soviet citizens.\r\n\r\nAmong these, near the village of Kholmetz of the Sychev region, when the\r\nmilitary authorities were required to remove the mines from an area, on\r\nthe order of the Commander of the 101st German Infantry Division,\r\nMajor-General Fisler, the German soldiers gathered the inhabitants of\r\nthe village of Kholmetz and forced them to remove mines from the road.\r\nAll of these people lost their lives as a result of exploding mines.\r\n\r\nIn the Leningrad region there were shot and tortured over 172,000\r\npersons, including over 20,000 persons who were killed in the city of\r\nLeningrad by the barbarous artillery barrage and the bombings.\r\n\r\nIn the Stavropol region in an anti-tank trench close to the station of\r\nMineralny Vody, and in other cities, tens of thousands of persons were\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nIn Pyatigorsk many were subjected to torture and criminal treatment,\r\nincluding suspension from the ceiling and other methods. Many of the\r\nvictims of these tortures were then shot.\r\n\r\nIn Krasnodar some 6,700 civilians were murdered by poison gas in gas\r\nvans, or were shot and tortured.\r\n\r\nIn the Stalingrad region more than 40,000 persons were killed and\r\ntortured. After the Germans were expelled from Stalingrad, more than a\r\nthousand mutilated bodies of local inhabitants were found with marks of\r\ntorture. One hundred and thirty-nine women had their arms painfully bent\r\nbackward and held by wires. From some their breasts had been cut off and\r\ntheir ears, fingers and toes had been amputated. The bodies bore the\r\nmarks of burns. On the bodies of the men the five pointed star was\r\nburned with an iron or cut with a knife. Some were disembowelled.\r\n\r\nIn Orel over 5,000 persons were murdered.\r\n\r\nIn Novgorod and in the Novgorod region many thousands of Soviet citizens\r\nwere killed by shooting, starvation and torture. In Minsk tens of\r\nthousands of citizens were similarly killed.\r\n\r\nIn the Crimea peaceful citizens were gathered on barges, taken out to\r\nsea and drowned, over 144,000 persons being exterminated in this manner.\r\n\r\nIn the Soviet Ukraine there were monstrous criminal acts of the Nazi\r\nconspirators. In Babi Yar, near Kiev, they shot over 100,000 men, women,\r\nchildren and old people. In this city in January, 1941, after the\r\nexplosion in German Headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Street the Germans\r\narrested as hostages 1,250 persons—old men, minors, women with nursing\r\ninfants. In Kiev they killed over 195,000 persons.\r\n\r\nIn Rovno and the Rovno region they killed and tortured over 100,000\r\npeaceful citizens.\r\n\r\nIn Dnepropetrovsk, near the Transport Institute, they shot or threw\r\nalive into a great ravine 11,000 women, old men and children.\r\n\r\nIn Kamenetz-Podolsk Region 31,000 Jews were shot and exterminated,\r\nincluding 13,000 persons brought there from Hungary.\r\n\r\nIn the Odessa Region at least 200,000 Soviet citizens were killed.\r\n\r\nIn Kharkov about 195,000 persons were either tortured to death, shot or\r\ngassed in gas vans.\r\n\r\nIn Gomel the Germans rounded up the population in prison, and tortured\r\nand tormented them, and then took them to the centre of the city and\r\nshot them in public.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Lyda in the Grodenen region on 8th May, 1942, 5,670\r\npersons were completely undressed, driven into pens in groups of 100 and\r\nthen shot by machine guns. Many were thrown in the graves while they\r\nwere still alive.\r\n\r\nAlong with adults the Nazi conspirators mercilessly destroyed even\r\nchildren. They killed them with their parents, in groups and alone. They\r\nkilled them in children’s homes and hospitals, burying the living in the\r\ngraves, throwing them into flames, stabbing them with bayonets,\r\npoisoning them, conducting experiments upon them, extracting their blood\r\nfor the use of the German Army, throwing them into prison and Gestapo\r\ntorture chambers and concentration camps, where the children died from\r\nhunger, torture and epidemic diseases.\r\n\r\nFrom 6th September to 24th November, 1942, in the region of Brest,\r\nPinsk, Kobren, Dyvina, Malority and Berezy-Kartuzsky about 400 children\r\nwere shot by German punitive units.\r\n\r\nIn the Yanov camp in the city of Lwow the Germans killed 8,000 children\r\nin two months.\r\n\r\nIn the resort of Tiberda the Germans annihilated 500 children suffering\r\nfrom tuberculosis of the bone, who were in the sanatorium for the cure.\r\n\r\nOn the territory of the Latvian S.S.R. the German usurpers killed\r\nthousands of children, which they had brought there with their parents\r\nfrom the Bielorussian S.S.R., and from the Kalinin, Kaluga and other\r\nregions of the R.S.F.S.R.\r\n\r\nIn Czechoslovakia as a result of torture, beating, hanging, and\r\nshootings, there were annihilated in Gestapo prisons in Brno, Seim and\r\nother places over 20,000 persons. Moreover many thousands of internees\r\nwere subjected to criminal treatment, beatings and torture.\r\n\r\nBoth before the war, as well as during the war, thousands of Czech\r\npatriots, in particular catholics and protestants, lawyers, doctors,\r\nteachers, etc., were arrested as hostages and imprisoned. A large number\r\nof these hostages were killed by the Germans.\r\n\r\nIn Greece in October, 1941, the male populations between 16 and 60 years\r\nof age of the Greek villages Amelofito, Kliston, Kizonia Mesovunos,\r\nSelli, Ano-Kerzilion and Kato-Kerzilion were shot—in all 416 persons.\r\n\r\nIn Yugoslavia many thousands of civilians were murdered. Other examples\r\nare given under paragraph (_D_), “Killing of Hostages”, below.\r\n\r\n    (_B_) DEPORTATION FOR SLAVE LABOUR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES OF THE\r\n          CIVILIAN POPULATIONS OF AND IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of the occupation by Germany of both the Western\r\nand the Eastern Countries it was the policy of the German Government and\r\nof the German High Command to deport able bodied citizens from such\r\noccupied countries to Germany and to other occupied countries for the\r\npurpose of slave labour upon defence works, in factories and in other\r\ntasks connected with the German War effort.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of such policy there were mass deportations from all the\r\nWestern and Eastern countries for such purposes during the whole period\r\nof the occupation.\r\n\r\nSuch deportations were contrary to international Conventions, in\r\nparticular to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and\r\ncustoms of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from\r\nthe criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of\r\nthe countries in which such crimes were committed and to Article 6 (_b_)\r\nof the Charter.\r\n\r\nParticulars of deportations, by way of example only and without\r\nprejudice to the production of evidence of other cases are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. From the Western Countries:\r\n\r\nFrom France the following deportations of persons for political and\r\nracial reasons took place—each of which consisted of from 1,500-2,500\r\ndeportees:\r\n\r\n                1940                         3 Transports\r\n                1941                        14 Transports\r\n                1942                       104 Transports\r\n                1943                       257 Transports\r\n                1944                       326 Transports\r\n\r\nSuch deportees were subjected to the most barbarous conditions of\r\novercrowding; they were provided with wholly insufficient clothing and\r\nwere given little or no food for several days.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of transport were such that many deportees died in the\r\ncourse of the voyage, for example:\r\n\r\nIn one of the wagons of the train which left Compiegne for Buchenwald,\r\non the 17th September, 1943, 80 men died out of 130;\r\n\r\nOn 4th June, 1944, 484 bodies were taken out of the train at Sarrebourg;\r\n\r\nIn a train which left Compiegne on the 2nd July, 1944, for Dachau, more\r\nthan 600 dead were found on arrival, i.e., one-third of the total\r\nnumber;\r\n\r\nIn a train which left Compiegne on the 16th January, 1944, for\r\nBuchenwald more than 100 men were confined in each wagon, the dead and\r\nthe wounded being heaped in the last wagon during the voyage;\r\n\r\nIn April, 1945, of 12,000 internees evacuated from Buchenwald, 4,000\r\nonly were still alive when the marching column arrived near Regensburg.\r\n\r\nDuring the German occupation of Denmark, 5,200 Danish subjects were\r\ndeported to Germany and there imprisoned in concentration camps and\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nIn 1942 and thereafter 6,000 nationals of Luxembourg were departed from\r\ntheir country under deplorable conditions as a result of which many of\r\nthem perished.\r\n\r\nFrom Belgium between 1940 and 1941 at least 190,000 civilians were\r\ndeported to Germany and used as slave labour. Such deportees were\r\nsubjected to ill-treatment and many of them were compelled to work in\r\narmament factories.\r\n\r\nFrom Holland, between 1940 and 1944 nearly half a million civilians were\r\ndeported to Germany and to other occupied countries.\r\n\r\n2. From the Eastern Countries:\r\n\r\nThe German occupying authorities deported from the Soviet Union to\r\nslavery about 4,978,000 Soviet citizens.\r\n\r\n750,000 Czechoslovakian citizens were taken away for forced labor\r\noutside the Czechoslovak frontiers in the interior of the German war\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 1941, in the city of Zagreb (Yugoslavia) a meeting of German\r\nrepresentatives was called with the Councillor Von Troll presiding. The\r\npurpose was to set up the means of deporting the Yugoslav population\r\nfrom Slovenia. Tens of thousands of persons were deported in carrying\r\nout this plan.\r\n\r\n(_C_) MURDER AND ILL-TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR, AND OF OTHER MEMBERS\r\n OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE COUNTRIES WITH WHOM GERMANY WAS AT WAR, AND\r\n                      OF PERSONS ON THE HIGH SEAS\r\n\r\nThe Defendants murdered and ill-treated prisoners of war by denying them\r\nadequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care and attention; by\r\nforcing them to labor in inhumane conditions; by torturing them and\r\nsubjecting them to inhuman indignities and by killing them. The German\r\nGovernment and the German High Command imprisoned prisoners of war in\r\nvarious concentration camps, where they were killed and subjected to\r\ninhuman treatment by the various methods set forth in paragraph VIII\r\n(_A_). Members of the armed forces of the countries with whom Germany\r\nwas at war were frequently murdered while in the act of surrendering.\r\nThese murders and ill-treatment were contrary to International\r\nConventions, particularly Articles 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, 1907, and to Articles 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the Prisoners of War\r\nConvention (Geneva 1929) the laws and customs of war, the general\r\nprinciples of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all\r\ncivilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which\r\nsuch crimes were committed and to Article 6 (_b_) of the Charter.\r\n\r\nParticulars by way of examples and without prejudice to the production\r\nof evidence of other cases, are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In the Western Countries:\r\n\r\nFrench officers who escaped from Oflag X C were handed over to the\r\nGestapo and disappeared; others were murdered by their guards; others\r\nsent to concentration camps and exterminated. Among others, the men of\r\nStalag VI C were sent to Buchenwald.\r\n\r\nFrequently prisoners captured on the Western Front were obliged to march\r\nto the camps until they completely collapsed. Some of them walked more\r\nthan 600 kilometers with hardly any food; they marched on for 48 hours\r\nrunning, without being fed; among them a certain number died of\r\nexhaustion or of hunger; stragglers were systematically murdered.\r\n\r\nThe same crimes have been committed in 1943, 1944 and 1945 when the\r\noccupants of the camps were withdrawn before the Allied advance;\r\nparticularly during the withdrawal of the prisoners of Sagan on February\r\n8th, 1945.\r\n\r\nBodily punishments were inflicted upon non-commissioned officers and\r\ncadets who refused to work. On December 24th, 1943, three French N.C.O’s\r\nwere murdered for that motive in Stalag IV A. Many ill-treatments were\r\ninflicted without motive on other ranks: stabbing with bayonets,\r\nstriking with rifle-butts and whipping; in Stalag XX B the sick\r\nthemselves were beaten many times by sentries; in Stalag III B and\r\nStalag III C, worn-out prisoners were murdered or grievously wounded. In\r\nmilitary gaols in Graudenz for instance, in reprisal camps as in\r\nRava-Ruska, the food was so insufficient that the men lost more than 15\r\nkilograms in a few weeks. In May, 1942, 1 loaf of bread only was\r\ndistributed in Rava-Ruska to each group of 35 men.\r\n\r\nOrders were given to transfer French officers in chains to the camp of\r\nMauthausen after they had tried to escape. At their arrival in camp they\r\nwere murdered, either by shooting, or by gas and their bodies destroyed\r\nin the crematorium.\r\n\r\nAmerican prisoners, officers and men, were murdered in Normandy during\r\nthe summer of 1944 and in the Ardennes in December, 1944. American\r\nprisoners were starved, beaten and otherwise mistreated in numerous\r\nStalag in Germany and in the occupied countries, particularly in 1943,\r\n1944 and 1945.\r\n\r\n2. In the Eastern Countries:\r\n\r\nAt Orel prisoners of war were exterminated by starvation, shooting,\r\nexposure, and poisoning.\r\n\r\nSoviet prisoners of war were murdered en masse on orders from the High\r\nCommand and the Headquarters of the SIPO and SD. Tens of thousands of\r\nSoviet prisoners of war were tortured and murdered at the “Gross\r\nLazaret” at Slavuta.\r\n\r\nIn addition, many thousands of the persons referred to in paragraph VIII\r\n(A) 2, above, were Soviet prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nPrisoners of war who escaped and were recaptured were handed over to\r\nSIPO and SD for shooting.\r\n\r\nFrenchmen fighting with the Soviet Army who were captured were handed\r\nover to the Vichy Government for “proceedings”.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1944, 50 R.A.F. officers who escaped from Stalag Luft III at\r\nSagan, when recaptured, were murdered.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1941, 11,000 Polish officers, who were prisoners of war\r\nwere killed in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk.\r\n\r\nIn Yugoslavia the German Command and the occupying authorities in the\r\nperson of the chief officials of the Police, the SS troops (Police\r\nLieutenant General Rosener) and the Divisional Group Command (General\r\nKuebler and others) in the period 1941-43 ordered the shooting of\r\nprisoners of war.\r\n\r\n                       (_D_) KILLING OF HOSTAGES\r\n\r\nThroughout the territories occupied by the German armed forces in the\r\ncourse of waging aggressive wars, the defendants adopted and put into\r\neffect on a wide scale the practice of taking, and of killing, hostages\r\nfrom the civilian population. These acts were contrary to International\r\nConventions, particularly Article 50 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the\r\nlaws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as\r\nderived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal\r\npenal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed and to\r\nArticle 6 (_b_) of the Charter.\r\n\r\nParticulars by way of example and without prejudice to the production of\r\nevidence of other cases, are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In the Western Countries:\r\n\r\nIn France hostages were executed either individually or collectively;\r\nthese executions took place in all the big cities of France, among\r\nothers in Paris, Bordeaux and Nantes, as well as at Chateabriant.\r\n\r\nIn Holland many hundreds of hostages were shot at the following among\r\nother places—Rotterdam, Apeldoorn, Amsterdam, Benschop and Haarlem.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium many hundreds of hostages were shot during the period 1940 to\r\n1944.\r\n\r\n2. In the Eastern Countries:\r\n\r\nAt Kragnevatz in Yugoslavia 2,300 hostages were shot in October, 1941.\r\n\r\nAt Kralevo in Yugoslavia 5,000 hostages were shot.\r\n\r\n              (_E_) PLUNDER OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY\r\n\r\nThe defendants ruthlessly exploited the people and the material\r\nresources of the countries they occupied, in order to strengthen the\r\nNazi war machine, to depopulate and impoverish the rest of Europe, to\r\nenrich themselves and their adherents, and to promote German economic\r\nsupremacy over Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Defendants engaged in the following acts and practices, among\r\nothers:\r\n\r\n1. They degraded the standard of life of the people of occupied\r\ncountries and caused starvation, by stripping occupied countries of\r\nfoodstuffs for removal to Germany.\r\n\r\n2. They seized raw materials and industrial machinery in all of the\r\noccupied countries, removed them to Germany and used them in the\r\ninterest of the German war effort and the German economy.\r\n\r\n3. In all the occupied countries, in varying degrees, they confiscated\r\nbusinesses, plants and other property.\r\n\r\n4. In an attempt to give color of legality to illegal acquisitions of\r\nproperty, they forced owners of property to go through the forms of\r\n“voluntary” and “legal” transfers.\r\n\r\n5. They established comprehensive controls over the economies of all of\r\nthe occupied countries and directed their resources, their production\r\nand their labor in the interests of the German war economy, depriving\r\nthe local populations of the products of essential industries.\r\n\r\n6. By a variety of financial mechanisms, they despoiled all of the\r\noccupied countries of essential commodities and accumulated wealth,\r\ndebased the local currency systems and disrupted the local economies.\r\nThey financed extensive purchases in occupied countries through clearing\r\narrangements by which they exacted loans from the occupied countries.\r\nThey imposed occupation levies, exacted financial contributions, and\r\nissued occupation currency, far in excess of occupation costs. They used\r\nthese excess funds to finance the purchase of business properties and\r\nsupplies in the occupied countries.\r\n\r\n7. They abrogated the rights of the local populations in the occupied\r\nportions of the USSR and in Poland and in other countries to develop or\r\nmanage agricultural and industrial properties, and reserved this area\r\nfor exclusive settlement, development, and ownership by Germans and\r\ntheir so-called racial brethren.\r\n\r\n8. In further development of their plan of criminal exploitation, they\r\ndestroyed industrial cities, cultural monuments, scientific\r\ninstitutions, and property of all types in the occupied territories to\r\neliminate the possibility of competition with Germany.\r\n\r\n9. From their program of terror, slavery, spoliation and organized\r\noutrage, the Nazi conspirators created an instrument for the personal\r\nprofit and aggrandizement of themselves and their adherents. They\r\nsecured for themselves and their adherents\r\n\r\n      (_a_) Positions in administration of business involving power,\r\ninfluence and lucrative perquisites.\r\n\r\n      (_b_) The use of cheap forced labor.\r\n\r\n      (_c_) The acquisition on advantageous terms of foreign properties,\r\nbusiness interests, and raw materials.\r\n\r\n      (_d_) The basis for the industrial supremacy of Germany.\r\n\r\nThese acts were contrary to International Conventions, particularly\r\nArticles 46 to 56 inclusive of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and\r\ncustoms of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from\r\nthe criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of\r\nthe countries in which such crimes were committed and to Article 6 (_b_)\r\nof the Charter.\r\n\r\nParticulars (by way of example and without prejudice to the production\r\nof evidence of other cases) are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Western Countries:\r\n\r\nThere was plundered from the Western Countries from 1940 to 1944, works\r\nof art, artistic objects, pictures, plastics, furniture, textiles,\r\nantique pieces and similar articles of enormous value to the number of\r\n21,903.\r\n\r\nIn France statistics show the following:\r\n\r\n                        _Removal of Raw Materials_\r\n             Coal                             63,000,000 tons\r\n             Electric energy                      20,976 Mkwh\r\n             Petrol and fuel                   1,943,750 tons\r\n             Iron ore                         74,848,000 tons\r\n             Siderurgical products             3,822,000 tons\r\n             Bauxite                           1,211,800 tons\r\n             Cement                            5,984,000 tons\r\n             Lime                              1,888,000 tons\r\n             Quarry products                  25,872,000 tons\r\n\r\nand various other products to a total value of 79,961,423,000 francs.\r\n\r\n                   _Removal of Industrial Equipment_\r\n\r\nTotal: 9,759,861,000 Francs, of which 2,626,479,000 Francs of Machine\r\nTools.\r\n\r\n                   _Removal of Agricultural Produce_\r\n\r\nTotal: 126,655,852,000 francs, i.e., for the principal\r\n\r\n            Products:\r\n               Wheat                   2,947,337 tons\r\n               Oats                    2,354,080 tons\r\n               Milk                      790,000 hectolitres\r\n               Milk (concentrated        460,000 hectolitres\r\n                 and in powder)\r\n               Butter                     76,000 tons\r\n               Cheese                     49,000 tons\r\n               Potatoes                  725,975 tons\r\n               Various vegetables        575,000 tons\r\n               Wine                    7,647,000 hectolitres\r\n               Champagne              87,000,000 bottles\r\n               Beer                    3,821,520 hectolitres\r\n               Various kinds of        1,830,000 hectolitres\r\n                 alcohol\r\n\r\n                   _Removal of Manufactured Products_\r\n\r\nto a total of 184,640,000 francs.\r\n\r\n                              _Plundering_\r\n\r\nFrancs: 257,020,024,000 from private enterprise.\r\n\r\nFrancs: 55,000,100,000 from the State.\r\n\r\n                        _Financial Exploitation_\r\n\r\nFrom June 1940 to September 1944 the French Treasury was compelled to\r\npay to Germany 631,866,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\n               _Looting and Destruction of Works of Art_\r\n\r\nThe museums of Nantes, Nancy, Old-Marseilles were looted.\r\n\r\nPrivate collections of great value were stolen. In this way Raphaels,\r\nVermeers, Van Dycks and works of Rubens, Holbein, Rembrandt, Watteau,\r\nBoucher disappeared. Germany compelled France to deliver up “The Mystic\r\nLamb” by Van Eyck, which Belgium had entrusted to her.\r\n\r\nIn Norway and other occupied countries decrees were made by which the\r\nproperty of many civilians, societies, etc., was confiscated. An immense\r\namount of property of every kind was plundered from France, Belgium,\r\nNorway, Holland and Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the economic plundering of Belgium between 1940 and 1944\r\nthe damage suffered amounted to 175 billions of Belgian francs.\r\n\r\n2. Eastern Countries:\r\n\r\nDuring the occupation of the Eastern Countries the German Government and\r\nthe German High Command carried out, as a systematic policy, a\r\ncontinuous course of plunder and destruction including:—\r\n\r\nOn the territory of the Soviet Union the Nazi conspirators destroyed or\r\nseverely damaged 1,710 cities and more than 70,000 villages and hamlets,\r\nmore than 6,000,000 buildings and made homeless about 25,000,000\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nAmong the cities which suffered most destruction are Stalingrad,\r\nSevastopol, Kiev, Minsk, Odessa, Smolensk, Novgorod, Pskov, Orel,\r\nKharkov, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don, Stalino and Leningrad.\r\n\r\nAs is evident from an official memorandum of the German command, the\r\nNazi conspirators planned the complete annihilation of entire Soviet\r\ncities. In completely secret order of the Chief of the Naval Staff\r\n(Staff Ia No. 1601/41, dated 29, IX, 1941), addressed only to Staff\r\nofficers, it was said:\r\n\r\n“The Fuehrer has decided to erase from the face of the earth St.\r\nPetersburgh. The existence of this large city will have no further\r\ninterest after Soviet Russia is destroyed. Finland has also said that\r\nthe existence of this city on her new border is not desirable from her\r\npoint of view. The original request of the Navy that docks, harbor, etc.\r\nnecessary for the fleet be preserved—is known to the Supreme Commander\r\nof the Military Forces, but the basic principles of carrying out\r\noperations against St. Petersburgh do not make it possible to satisfy\r\nthis request.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to approach near to the city and to destroy it with the\r\naid of an artillery barrage from weapons of different calibres and with\r\nlong air attacks.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the life of the population and the provisioning of them\r\nis a problem which cannot and must not be decided by us.\r\n\r\nIn this war * * * we are not interested in preserving even a part of the\r\npopulation of this large city.”\r\n\r\nThe Germans destroyed 427 museums, among them the wealthy museums of\r\nLeningrad, Smolensk, Stalingrad, Novgorod, Poltava and others.\r\n\r\nIn Pyatigorsk the art objects brought there from the Rostov museum were\r\nseized.\r\n\r\nThe losses suffered by the coal mining industry alone in the Stalin\r\nRegion amount to 2,000,000,000 rubles. There was colossal destruction of\r\nindustrial establishments in Makerevka, Carlovka, Yenakievo,\r\nKonstantinovka, Mariupol, from which most of the machinery and factories\r\nwere removed.\r\n\r\nStealing of huge dimensions and the destruction of industrial, cultural\r\nand other property was typified in Kiev. More than 4,000,000 books,\r\nmagazines and manuscripts (many of which were very valuable and even\r\nunique) and a large number of artistic productions and valuables of\r\ndifferent kinds were stolen and carried away.\r\n\r\nMany valuable art productions were taken away from Riga.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the plunder of cultural valuables is evidenced by the fact\r\nthat 100,000 valuable volumes and 70 cases of ancient periodicals and\r\nprecious monographs were carried away by Rosenberg’s staff alone.\r\n\r\nAmong further examples of these crimes are:\r\n\r\nWanton devastation of the city of Novgorod and of many historical and\r\nartistic monuments there. Wanton devastation and plunder of the city of\r\nRovno and of its province. The destruction of the industrial, cultural\r\nand other property in Odessa. The destruction of cities and villages in\r\nSoviet Karelia. The destruction in Estonia of cultural, industrial and\r\nother buildings.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of medical and prophylactic institutes, the destruction\r\nof agriculture and industry in Lithuania, the destruction of cities in\r\nLatvia.\r\n\r\nThe Germans approached monuments of culture, dear to the Soviet people,\r\nwith special hatred. They broke up the estate of the poet Pushkin in\r\nMikhailovskoye, desecrating his grave, and destroying the neighboring\r\nvillages and the Svyatogor monastery.\r\n\r\nThey destroyed the estate and museum of Lev Tolstoy, “Yasnaya Polyana”\r\nand desecrated the grave of the great writer. They destroyed in Klin the\r\nmuseum of Tsaikovsky and in Penaty, the museum of the painter Repin and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators destroyed 1,670 Greek Orthodox Churches, 237 Roman\r\nCatholic Churches, 67 Chapels, 532 Synagogues, etc.\r\n\r\nThey broke up, desecrated and senselessly destroyed also the most\r\nvaluable monuments of the Christian Church, such as Kievo-Pecherskaya\r\nLavra, Novy Jerusalem in the Istrin region, and the most ancient\r\nmonasteries and churches.\r\n\r\nDestruction in Esthonia of cultural industrial and other premises:\r\nburning down of many thousands of residential buildings: removal of\r\n10,000 works of art: destruction of medical and prophylactic\r\ninstitutions. Plunder and removal to Germany of immense quantities of\r\nagricultural stock including horses, cows, pigs, poultry, beehives and\r\nagricultural machines of all kinds.\r\n\r\nDestruction of agriculture, enslavement of peasants and looting of stock\r\nand produce in Lithuania.\r\n\r\nIn the Latvian Republic destruction of the agriculture by the looting of\r\nall stock, machinery and produce.\r\n\r\nThe result of this policy of plunder and destruction was to lay waste\r\nthe land and cause utter desolation.\r\n\r\nThe overall value of the material loss which the U.S.S.R. has borne, is\r\ncomputed to be 679,000,000,000 rubles, in state prices of 1941.\r\n\r\nFollowing the German occupation of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939 the\r\ndefendants seized and stole large stocks of raw materials, copper, tin,\r\niron, cotton, and food; caused to be taken to Germany large amounts of\r\nrailway rolling stock, and many engines, carriages, steam vessels and\r\ntrolley buses; plundered libraries, laboratories, and art museums of\r\nbooks, pictures, objects of art, scientific apparatus and furniture;\r\nstole all gold reserves and foreign exchange of Czechoslovakia,\r\nincluding 23,000 kilograms of gold of a nominal value of £5,265,000;\r\nfraudulently acquired control and thereafter looted the Czech banks and\r\nmany Czech industrial enterprises; and otherwise stole, looted and\r\nmisappropriated Czechoslovak public and private property. The total sum\r\nof defendants’ economic spoliation of Czechoslovakia from 1938 to 1945\r\nis estimated at 200,000,000,000 Czechoslovak crowns.\r\n\r\n               (_F_) THE EXACTION OF COLLECTIVE PENALTIES\r\n\r\nThe Germans pursued a systematic policy of inflicting, in all the\r\noccupied countries, collective penalties, pecuniary and otherwise, upon\r\nthe population for acts of individuals for which it could not be\r\nregarded as collectively responsible; this was done at many places,\r\nincluding Oslo, Stavanger, Trondheim and Rogaland.\r\n\r\nSimilar instances occurred in France, among others in Dijon, Nantes and\r\nas regards the Jewish population in the occupied territories. The total\r\namount of fines imposed on French communities add up to 1,157,179,484\r\nfrancs made up as follows—\r\n\r\n           A fine on the Jewish population       1,000,000,000\r\n           Various fines                           157,179,484\r\n\r\nThese acts violated Article 50, Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and\r\ncustoms of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from\r\nthe criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of\r\nthe countries in which such crimes were committed and Article 6 (_b_) of\r\nthe Charter.\r\n\r\n (_G_) WANTON DESTRUCTION OF CITIES, TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND DEVASTATION\r\n                  NOT JUSTIFIED BY MILITARY NECESSITY\r\n\r\nThe Defendants wantonly destroyed cities, towns and villages and\r\ncommitted other acts of devastation without military justification or\r\nnecessity. These acts violated Articles 46 and 50 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles\r\nof criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized\r\nnations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes\r\nwere committed and Article 6 (_b_) of the Charter.\r\n\r\nParticulars by way of example only and without prejudice to the\r\nproduction of evidence of other cases are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Western Countries:\r\n\r\nIn March, 1941, part of Lofoten in Norway was destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1942, the town of Telerag in Norway was destroyed.\r\n\r\nEntire villages were destroyed in France, among others\r\nOradour-sur-Glane, Saint-Nizier and, in the Vercors, La Mure, Vassieux,\r\nLa Chapelle en Vercors. The town of Saint Dié was burnt down and\r\ndestroyed. The Old Port District of Marseilles was dynamited in the\r\nbeginning of 1943 and resorts along the Atlantic and the Mediterranean\r\ncoasts, particularly the town of Sanary, were demolished.\r\n\r\nIn Holland there was most widespread and extensive destruction, not\r\njustified by military necessity, including the destruction of harbours,\r\nlocks, dykes and bridges: immense devastation was also caused by\r\ninundations which equally were not justified by military necessity.\r\n\r\n2. Eastern Countries:\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Countries the Defendants pursued a policy of wanton\r\ndestruction and devastation: some particulars of this (without prejudice\r\nto the production of evidence of other cases) are set out above under\r\nthe heading—“Plunder of Public and Private Property”.\r\n\r\nIn Greece in 1941, the villages of Amelofito, Kliston, Kizonia,\r\nMessovunos, Selli, Ano-Kerzilion and Kato-Kerzilion were utterly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIn Yugoslavia on 15 August, 1941, the German military command officially\r\nannounced that the village of Skela was burned to the ground and the\r\ninhabitants killed on the order of the command.\r\n\r\nOn the order of the Field Commander Hoersterberg a punitive expedition\r\nfrom the SS troops and the field police destroyed the villages of\r\nMachkovats, and Kriva Reka in Serbia and all the inhabitants were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fritz Neidhold (369 Infantry Division) on 11 September, 1944,\r\ngave an order to destroy the villages of Zagniezde and Udora, hanging\r\nall the men and driving away all the women and children.\r\n\r\nIn Czechoslovakia the Nazi conspirators also practised the senseless\r\ndestruction of populated places. Lezaky and Lidice were burned to the\r\nground and the inhabitants killed.\r\n\r\n                 (_H_) CONSCRIPTION OF CIVILIAN LABOUR\r\n\r\nThroughout the occupied territories the defendants conscripted and\r\nforced the inhabitants to labour and requisitioned their services for\r\npurposes other than meeting the needs of the armies of occupation and to\r\nan extent far out of proportion to the resources of the countries\r\ninvolved. All the civilians so conscripted were forced to work for the\r\nGerman war effort. Civilians were required to register and many of those\r\nwho registered were forced to join the Todt Organization and the Speer\r\nLegion, both of which were semi-military organizations involving some\r\nmilitary training. These acts violated Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles\r\nof criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized\r\nnations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes\r\nwere committed and Article 6 (_b_) of the Charter.\r\n\r\nParticulars, by way of example only and without prejudice to the\r\nproduction of evidence of other cases, are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Western Countries:\r\n\r\nIn France, from 1942 to 1944, 963,813 persons were compelled to work in\r\nGermany and 737,000 to work in France for the German Army.\r\n\r\nIn Luxembourg in 1944 alone, 2,500 men and 500 girls were conscripted\r\nfor forced labor.\r\n\r\n2. Eastern Countries:\r\n\r\nOf the large number of citizens of the Soviet Union and of\r\nCzechoslovakia referred to under Count Three VIII (_B_) 2 above many\r\nwere so conscripted for forced labor.\r\n\r\n(_I_) FORCING CIVILIANS OF OCCUPIED TERRITORIES TO SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO A\r\n                             HOSTILE POWER\r\n\r\nCivilians who joined the Speer Legion, as set forth in paragraph (_H_)\r\nabove, were required under threat of depriving them of food, money and\r\nidentity papers, to swear a solemn oath acknowledging unconditional\r\nobedience to Adolf Hitler, the Fuehrer of Germany, which was to them a\r\nhostile power.\r\n\r\nIn Lorraine, Civil Servants were obliged, in order to retain their\r\npositions, to sign a declaration by which they acknowledged the “return\r\nof their Country to the Reich”, pledged themselves to obey without\r\nreservation the orders of their Chiefs and put themselves “at the active\r\nservice of the Fuehrer and the Great National Socialist Germany”.\r\n\r\nA similar pledge was imposed on Alsatian Civil Servants by threat of\r\ndeportation or internment.\r\n\r\nThese acts violated Article 45 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws\r\nand customs of war, the general principles of international law and\r\nArticle 6 (_b_) of the Charter.\r\n\r\n              (_J_) GERMANIZATION OF OCCUPIED TERRITORIES\r\n\r\nIn certain occupied territories purportedly annexed to Germany the\r\ndefendants methodically and pursuant to plan endeavoured to assimilate\r\nthose territories politically, culturally, socially and economically\r\ninto the German Reich. The defendants endeavoured to obliterate the\r\nformer national character of these territories. In pursuance of these\r\nplans and endeavours, the defendants forcibly deported inhabitants who\r\nwere predominantly non-German and introduced thousands of German\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nThis plan included economic domination, physical conquest, installation\r\nof puppet Governments, purported de jure annexation and enforced\r\nconscription into the German Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nThis was carried out in most of the Occupied Countries including:\r\nNorway, France (particularly in the departments of Upper Rhine, Lower\r\nRhine, Moselle, Ardennes, Aisne, Nord, Meurthe and Moselle), Luxembourg,\r\nthe Soviet Union, Denmark, Belgium, Holland.\r\n\r\nIn France in the Departments of the Aisne, the Nord, the Meurthe and\r\nMoselle, and especially in that of the Ardennes, rural properties were\r\nseized by a German state organization which tried to have them exploited\r\nunder German direction; the landowners of these exploitations were\r\ndispossessed and turned into agricultural labourers.\r\n\r\nIn the Department of the Upper Rhine, the Lower Rhine and the Moselle,\r\nthe methods of Germanization were those of annexation followed by\r\nconscription.\r\n\r\n1. From the month of August, 1940, officials who refused to take the\r\noath of allegiance to the Reich were expelled. On September 21st\r\nexpulsions and deportation of populations began and on November 22nd,\r\n1940, more than 70,000 Lorrainers or Alsacians were driven into the\r\nSouth zone of France. From July 31, 1941, onwards, more than 100,000\r\npersons were deported into the Eastern regions of the Reich or to\r\nPoland. All the property of the deportees or expelled persons was\r\nconfiscated. At the same time, 80,000 Germans coming from the Saar or\r\nfrom Westphalia, were installed in Lorraine and 2,000 farms belonging to\r\nFrench people were transferred to Germans.\r\n\r\n2. From 2nd January, 1942, all the young people of the Departments of\r\nthe Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine, aged from 10 to 18 years, were\r\nincorporated in the Hitler Youth. The same thing was done in the Moselle\r\nfrom 4th August, 1942. From 1940 all the French schools were closed,\r\ntheir staffs expelled, and the German school system was introduced in\r\nthe three departments.\r\n\r\n3. On the 28th September, 1940, an order applicable to the Department of\r\nthe Moselle ordained the Germanization of all the surnames and christian\r\nnames which were French in form. The same thing was done from the 15th\r\nJanuary, 1943, in the Departments of the Upper Rhine and the Lower\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\n4. Two orders from the 23rd to 24th August, 1942, imposed by force\r\nGerman nationality on French citizens.\r\n\r\n5. On the 8th May, 1941, for the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine, the\r\n23rd April, 1941, for the Moselle, orders were promulgated enforcing\r\ncompulsory labour service on all French citizens of either sex aged from\r\n17 to 25 years. From the 1st January, 1942, for young men and from the\r\n26th January, 1942, for young girls, national labour service was\r\neffectively organized in the Moselle. It was from the 27th August, 1942,\r\nin the Upper-Rhine and in the Lower Rhine for young men only. The\r\nclasses 1940, 1941, 1942 were called up.\r\n\r\n6. These classes were retained in the Wehrmacht on the expiration of\r\ntheir time and labour service. On the 19th August, 1942, an order\r\ninstituted compulsory military service in the Moselle. On the 25th\r\nAugust, 1942, the classes 1940-44 were called up in three Departments.\r\nConscription was enforced by the German authorities in conformity with\r\nthe provisions of German legislation. The first revision boards took\r\nplace from the 3rd September, 1942. Later in the Upper Rhine and the\r\nLower Rhine new levies were effected everywhere on classes 1928 to 1939\r\ninclusive. The French people who refused to obey these laws were\r\nconsidered as deserters and their families were deported, while their\r\nproperty was confiscated.\r\n\r\nThese acts violated Articles 43, 46, 55 and 56 of the Hague Regulations,\r\n1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal\r\nlaw as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the\r\ninternal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed\r\nand Article 6 (_b_) of the Charter.\r\n\r\n IX. Individual, group and organization responsibility for the offense\r\n                         stated in Count Three\r\n\r\nReference is hereby made to Appendix A of this Indictment for a\r\nstatement of the responsibility of the individual defendants for the\r\noffense set forth in this Count Three of the Indictment. Reference is\r\nhereby made to Appendix B of this Indictment for a statement of the\r\nresponsibility of the groups, and organizations named herein as criminal\r\ngroups and organizations for the offense set forth in this Count Three\r\nof the Indictment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COUNT FOUR—CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY\r\n\r\n               (Charter, Article 6, especially 6 (_c_).)\r\n                      X. Statement of the Offense\r\n\r\nAll the defendants committed Crimes against Humanity during a period of\r\nyears preceding 8th May, 1945 in Germany and in all those countries and\r\nterritories occupied by the German armed forces since 1st September,\r\n1939 and in Austria and Czechoslovakia and in Italy and on the High\r\nSeas.\r\n\r\nAll the defendants, acting in concert with others, formulated and\r\nexecuted a common plan or conspiracy to commit Crimes against Humanity\r\nas defined in Article 6(_c_) of the Charter. This plan involved, among\r\nother things, the murder and persecution of all who were or who were\r\nsuspected of being hostile to the Nazi Party and all who were or who\r\nwere suspected of being opposed to the common plan alleged in Count One.\r\n\r\nThe said Crimes against Humanity were committed by the defendants and by\r\nother persons for whose acts the defendants are responsible (under\r\nArticle 6 of the Charter) as such other persons, when committing the\r\nsaid War Crimes, performed their acts in execution of a common plan and\r\nconspiracy to commit the said War Crimes, in the formulation and\r\nexecution of which plan and conspiracy all the defendants participated\r\nas leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices.\r\n\r\nThese methods and crimes constituted violations of international\r\nconventions, of internal penal laws, of the general principles of\r\ncriminal law as derived from the criminal law of all civilized nations\r\nand were involved in and part of a systematic course of conduct. The\r\nsaid acts were contrary to Article 6 of the Charter.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution will rely upon the facts pleaded under Count Three as\r\nalso constituting Crimes against Humanity.\r\n\r\n(_A_) MURDER, EXTERMINATION, ENSLAVEMENT, DEPORTATION AND OTHER INHUMANE\r\n ACTS COMMITTED AGAINST CIVILIAN POPULATIONS BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR\r\n\r\nFor the purposes set out above, the defendants adopted a policy of\r\npersecution, repression, and extermination of all civilians in Germany\r\nwho were, or who were believed to, or who were believed likely to\r\nbecome, hostile to the Nazi Government and the common plan or conspiracy\r\ndescribed in Count One. They imprisoned such persons without judicial\r\nprocess, holding them in “protective custody” and concentration camps,\r\nand subjected them to persecution, degradation, despoilment,\r\nenslavement, torture and murder.\r\n\r\nSpecial courts were established to carry out the will of the\r\nconspirators; favoured branches or agencies of the State and Party were\r\npermitted to operate outside the range even of nazified law and to crush\r\nall tendencies and elements which were considered “undesirable”. The\r\nvarious concentration camps included Buchenwald, which was established\r\nin 1933 and Dachau, which was established in 1934. At these and other\r\ncamps the civilians were put to slave labour, and murdered and\r\nill-treated by divers means, including those set out in Count Three\r\nabove, and these acts and policies were continued and extended to the\r\noccupied countries after the 1st September, 1939, and until 8th May,\r\n1945.\r\n\r\n    (_B_) PERSECUTION ON POLITICAL, RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS GROUNDS IN\r\n EXECUTION OF AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMON PLAN MENTIONED IN COUNT\r\n                                  ONE\r\n\r\nAs above stated, in execution of and in connection with the common plan\r\nmentioned in Count One, opponents of the German Government were\r\nexterminated and persecuted. These persecutions were directed against\r\nJews. They were also directed against persons whose political belief or\r\nspiritual aspirations were deemed to be in conflict with the aims of the\r\nNazis.\r\n\r\nJews were systematically persecuted since 1933; they were deprived of\r\ntheir liberty, thrown into concentration camps where they were murdered\r\nand ill-treated. Their property was confiscated. Hundreds of thousands\r\nof Jews were so treated before the 1st September, 1939.\r\n\r\nSince the 1st September, 1939, the persecution of the Jews was\r\nredoubled: millions of Jews from Germany and from the occupied Western\r\nCountries were sent to the Eastern Countries for extermination.\r\n\r\nParticulars by way of example and without prejudice to the production of\r\nevidence of other cases are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Nazis murdered amongst others Chancellor Dollfuss, the Social\r\nDemocrat Breitscheid and the Communist Thaelmann. They imprisoned in\r\nconcentration camps numerous political and religious personages, for\r\nexample Chancellor Schuschnigg and Pastor Niemoeller.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1938 by orders of the Chief of the Gestapo, anti-Jewish\r\ndemonstrations all over Germany took place. Jewish property was\r\ndestroyed, 30,000 Jews were arrested and sent to concentration camps and\r\ntheir property confiscated.\r\n\r\nUnder paragraph VIII (_A_), above, millions of the persons there\r\nmentioned as having been murdered and ill-treated were Jews.\r\n\r\nAmong other mass murders of Jews were the following:\r\n\r\nAt Kislovdosk all Jews were made to give up their property: 2,000 were\r\nshot in an anti-tank ditch at Mineraliye Vodi: 4,300 other Jews were\r\nshot in the same ditch.\r\n\r\n              60,000 Jews were shot on an island on the Dvina\r\n                       near Riga.\r\n              20,000 Jews were shot at Lutsk.\r\n              32,000 Jews were shot at Sarny.\r\n              60,000 Jews were shot at Kiev and\r\n                       Dniepropetrovsk.\r\n\r\nThousands of Jews were gassed weekly by means of gas-wagons which broke\r\ndown from overwork.\r\n\r\nAs the Germans retreated before the Soviet Army they exterminated Jews\r\nrather than allow them to be liberated. Many concentration camps and\r\nghettos were set up in which Jews were incarcerated and tortured,\r\nstarved, subjected to merciless atrocities and finally exterminated.\r\n\r\nAbout 70,000 Jews were exterminated in Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n XI.

Thus the territorial leaders among them were\r\ncalled Hoheitstraeger, or bearers of sovereignty, and were entitled to\r\ncall upon and utilize the various Party formations when necessary for\r\nthe execution of Party policies.\r\n\r\nReference is hereby made to the allegations in Count One of the\r\nIndictment showing that the Nazi Party was the central core of the\r\ncommon plan or conspiracy therein set forth. The Politischen Leiter, as\r\na major power within the Nazi Party proper, and functioning in the\r\ncapacities above-described and in association as a group, joined in the\r\ncommon plan or conspiracy, and accordingly share responsibility for the\r\ncrimes set forth in Counts One, Two, Three and Four of the Indictment.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution expressly reserves the right to request, at any time\r\nbefore sentence is pronounced, that Politischer Leiter of subordinate\r\ngrades or ranks or of other types or classes, to be specified by the\r\nprosecution, be excepted from further proceedings in this Case No. 1,\r\nbut without prejudice to other proceedings or actions against them.\r\n\r\nDIE SCHUTZSTAFFELN DER NATIONALSOZIALISTISCHEN DEUTSCHEN ARBEITERPARTEI\r\n  (COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE SS) INCLUDING DIE SICHERHEITSDIENST (COMMONLY\r\n                            KNOWN AS THE SD)\r\n\r\n“Die Schutzstaffeln der Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Arbeiterpartei\r\n(commonly known as the SS) including Die Sicherheitsdienst (commonly\r\nknown as the SD)” referred to in the Indictment consists of the entire\r\ncorps of the SS and all offices, departments, services, agencies,\r\nbranches, formations, organizations and groups of which it was at any\r\ntime comprised or which were at any time integrated in it, including but\r\nnot limited to, the Allgemeine SS, the Waffen SS, the SS Totenkopf\r\nVerbaende, SS Polizei Regimente and the Sicherheitsdienst des\r\nReichsfuehrers-SS (commonly known as the SD).\r\n\r\nThe SS, originally established by Hitler in 1925 as an élite section of\r\nthe SA to furnish a protective guard for the Fuehrer and Nazi Party\r\nleaders, became an independent formation of the Nazi Party in 1934 under\r\nthe leadership of the Reichsfuehrer-SS, Heinrich Himmler. It was\r\ncomposed of voluntary members, selected in accordance with Nazi\r\nbiological, racial and political theories, completely indoctrinated in\r\nNazi ideology and pledged to uncompromising obedience to the Fuehrer.\r\nAfter the accession of the Nazi conspirators to power, it developed many\r\ndepartments, agencies, formations and branches and extended its\r\ninfluence and control over numerous fields of governmental and Party\r\nactivity. Through Heinrich Himmler, as Reichsfuehrer-SS and Chief of the\r\nGerman Police, agencies and units of the SS and of the Reich were joined\r\nin operation to form a unified repressive police force. The\r\nSicherheitsdienst des Reichsfuehrers-SS (commonly known as the SD), a\r\ndepartment of the SS, was developed into a vast espionage and\r\ncounter-intelligence system which operated in conjunction with the\r\nGestapo and criminal police in detecting, suppressing and eliminating\r\ntendencies, groups and individuals deemed hostile or potentially hostile\r\nto the Nazi Party, its leaders, principles and objectives, and\r\neventually was combined with the Gestapo and criminal police in a single\r\nsecurity police department, the Reich Main Security Office.\r\n\r\nOther branches of the SS developed into an armed force and served in the\r\nwars of aggression referred to in Counts One and Two of the Indictment.\r\nThrough other departments and branches the SS controlled the\r\nadministration of concentration camps and the execution of Nazi racial,\r\nbiological and resettlement policies. Through its numerous functions and\r\nactivities it served as the instrument for insuring the domination of\r\nNazi ideology and protecting and extending the Nazi regime over Germany\r\nand occupied territories. It thus participated in and is responsible for\r\nthe crimes referred to in Counts One, Two, Three and Four of the\r\nIndictment.\r\n\r\n DIE GEHEIME STAATSPOLIZEI (SECRET STATE POLICE, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE\r\n                                GESTAPO)\r\n\r\n“Die Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police, commonly known as the\r\nGestapo)” referred to in the Indictment consists of the headquarters,\r\ndepartments, offices, branches and all the forces and personnel of the\r\nGeheime Staatspolizei organized or existing at any time after 30 January\r\n1933, including the Geheime Staatspolizei of Prussia and equivalent\r\nsecret or political police forces of the Reich and the components\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe Gestapo was created by the Nazi conspirators immediately after their\r\naccession to power, first in Prussia by the defendant GOERING and\r\nshortly thereafter in all other states in the Reich. These separate\r\nsecret and political police forces were developed into a centralized,\r\nuniform organization operating through a central headquarters and\r\nthrough a network of regional offices in Germany and in occupied\r\nterritories. Its officials and operatives were selected on the basis of\r\nunconditional acceptance of Nazi ideology, were largely drawn from\r\nmembers of the SS, and were trained in SS and SD schools. It acted to\r\nsuppress and eliminate tendencies, groups and individuals deemed hostile\r\nor potentially hostile to the Nazi Party, its leaders, principles and\r\nobjectives, and to repress resistance and potential resistance to German\r\ncontrol in occupied territories. In performing these functions it\r\noperated free from legal control, taking any measures it deemed\r\nnecessary for the accomplishment of its missions.\r\n\r\nThrough its purposes, activities and the means it used, it participated\r\nin and is responsible for the commission of the crimes set forth in\r\nCounts One, Two, Three and Four of the Indictment.\r\n\r\n       DIE STURMABTEILUNGEN DER NATIONALSOZIALISTISCHEN DEUTSCHEN\r\n               ARBEITERPARTEI (COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE SA)\r\n\r\n“Die Sturmabteilungen der Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen\r\nArbeiterpartei (commonly known as the SA)” referred to in the Indictment\r\nwas a formation of the Nazi Party under the immediate jurisdiction of\r\nthe Fuehrer, organized on military lines, whose membership was composed\r\nof volunteers serving as political soldiers of the Party. It was one of\r\nthe earliest formations of the Nazi Party and the original guardian of\r\nthe National Socialist movement. Founded in 1921 as a voluntary militant\r\nformation, it was developed by the Nazi conspirators before their\r\naccession to power into a vast private army and utilized for the purpose\r\nof creating disorder, and terrorizing and eliminating political\r\nopponents. It continued to serve as an instrument for the physical,\r\nideological and military training of Party members and as a reserve for\r\nthe German armed forces. After the launching of the wars of aggression,\r\nreferred to in Counts One and Two of the Indictment, the SA not only\r\noperated as an organization for military training but provided auxiliary\r\npolice and security forces in occupied territories, guarded\r\nprisoner-of-war camps and concentration camps and supervised and\r\ncontrolled persons forced to labour in Germany and occupied territories.\r\n\r\nThrough its purposes and activities and the means it used, it\r\nparticipated in and is responsible for the commission of the crimes set\r\nforth in Counts One, Two, Three and Four of the Indictment.\r\n\r\n       GENERAL STAFF AND HIGH COMMAND OF THE GERMAN ARMED FORCES\r\n\r\nThe “General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces” referred\r\nto in the Indictment consist of those individuals who between February\r\n1938 and May 1945 were the highest commanders of the Wehrmacht, the\r\nArmy, the Navy, and the Air Forces.

States, filed the following statement\r\nof reservation with the Tribunal and with the Chief Prosecutors of\r\nFrance, Great Britain, and Soviet Russia:\r\n\r\n                                                              Berlin\r\n                                                          6 October 1945\r\n\r\nM. Francois de Menthon,\r\nSir Hartley Shawcross,\r\nGeneral R. A. Rudenko.\r\n\r\nDear Sirs:\r\n\r\nIn the Indictment of German War Criminals signed today, reference is\r\nmade to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and certain other territories as\r\nbeing within the area of the USSR. This language is proposed by Russia\r\nand is accepted to avoid the delay which would be occasioned by\r\ninsistence on an alteration in the text. The Indictment is signed\r\nsubject to this reservation and understanding.\r\n\r\nI have no authority either to admit or to challenge, on behalf of the\r\nUnited States of America, Soviet claims to sovereignty over such\r\nterritories. Nothing, therefore, in this Indictment is to be construed\r\nas a recognition by the United States of such sovereignty or as\r\nindicating any attitude, either on the part of the United States or on\r\nthe part of the undersigned, toward any claim to recognition of such\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\r\n                                            [signed]  Robert H. Jackson\r\n                                                      ROBERT H. JACKSON\r\n                                  Chief of Counsel for the United States\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nTo the Clerk or Recording Officer,\r\n  International Military Tribunal:\r\n\r\nThe representative of the United States has found it necessary to make\r\ncertain reservations as to the possible bearing of certain language in\r\nthe Indictment upon political questions which are considered to be\r\nirrelevant to the proceedings before this Tribunal. However, it is\r\nconsidered appropriate to disclose such reservations that they may not\r\nbe unknown to the Tribunal in the event they should at any time be\r\nconsidered relevant. For that purpose, the foregoing copy is filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter IV\r\n               MOTIONS, RULINGS, AND EXPLANATORY MATERIAL\r\n                  RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THE DEFENDANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough 24 individuals were named as defendants in the Indictment\r\nsigned in Berlin on 6 October 1945, only 22 remained as defendants when\r\nthe trial commenced on 20 November. The number had been reduced by the\r\nsuicide of Robert Ley and by the Tribunal’s severance of Gustav Krupp\r\nvon Bohlen und Halbach from the proceedings. Of the 22 surviving\r\ndefendants only 20 appeared in the prisoners’ dock at the opening of\r\ncourt. Martin Bormann, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,\r\nwas presumed to be alive and at large. Ernst Kaltenbrunner had been\r\nhospitalized by a cranial hemorrhage, and as a consequence was unable to\r\nbe present at the trial save for one period of a few days.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel for two of the twenty men in the prisoners’ dock, Hess\r\nand Streicher, sought to have the proceedings against their clients\r\ndismissed on the grounds of their mental incapacity to stand trial.\r\nExpert medical examiners concluded that both defendants were fit to\r\ndefend themselves, and the proceedings against them were resumed. One of\r\nthem, Hess, who had claimed to be a victim of amnesia, created something\r\nof a sensation by confessing in open court that he had only been\r\npretending to suffer from amnesia and that his memory was actually in\r\ngood repair.\r\n\r\nFuller explanatory notes concerning the positions taken by the\r\nprosecution and the defense and the actions of the Tribunal in the cases\r\nof each of these six defendants, together with significant papers\r\nbearing on these matters, are printed hereinafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             1. ROBERT LEY\r\n\r\nPending the opening of the trial on 20 November 1945 the defendants were\r\nheld in the prison at the Palace of Justice in Nurnberg, under the\r\ncustody of the United States Army. In the evening of October 25 the\r\nguard on watch before the cell of Robert Ley noticed that the prisoner\r\nhad maintained the same position for some time without moving. The guard\r\nentered the cell to find that although the prison officials had taken\r\nevery known precaution, Ley had succeeded in committing suicide. Ley had\r\nripped the hemmed edge from a towel, twisted it, soaked it in water, and\r\nfashioned it into a crude noose which he fastened to an overhead toilet\r\nflush pipe. He had then stuffed his mouth with rags, apparently torn\r\nfrom his own underwear. When he seated himself, strangulation was\r\nproduced, and Robert Ley had succeeded in accomplishing his exit from\r\nthe court of judgment, and from the world of living men. A farewell\r\nmessage written by Ley, together with other statements made by him\r\nduring imprisonment, may be found at the end of the last volume\r\n(_Statements_ XI-XIII).\r\n\r\n\r\n                 2. GUSTAV KRUPP von BOHLEN und HALBACH\r\n\r\nThe name of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach stood thirteenth on the\r\nlist of twenty-four defendants accused in the Indictment signed in\r\nBerlin on 6 October 1945. On 4 November counsel for Krupp filed a motion\r\nrequesting that the Tribunal defer proceedings against the defendant\r\nuntil his health permitted him to stand trial, and that he should not be\r\ntried in his absence. The Tribunal on 5 November appointed a medical\r\ncommission consisting of representatives of the Soviet Union, France,\r\nGreat Britain, and the United States, to examine Krupp and determine\r\nwhether he was fit to stand trial. On 12 November the Chief of Counsel\r\nfor the United States filed an answer opposing the motion of defense\r\ncounsel and proposing that Gustav Krupp should not be dismissed from the\r\nproceedings unless Alfried Krupp, the son and sole owner of the Krupp\r\nWorks, were substituted as a defendant. On 14 November, before the\r\nopening of the trial itself, the Tribunal heard oral argument by the\r\nprosecution and defense, in which substantially the same views were\r\npresented as had been previously expressed in the written motions.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal on 15 November announced its ruling postponing the\r\nproceedings against Gustav Krupp, but retaining the Indictment charges\r\nagainst him on the docket for later trial if his physical and mental\r\ncondition should permit. The ruling stated that the question of adding\r\nanother name to the Indictment would be considered later. Thereupon, on\r\n16 November, the American Chief of Counsel filed a memorandum with the\r\nTribunal stating as a matter of record that the United States was not\r\ncommitted to participate in any subsequent four-power trial. On the same\r\nday the Soviet and French Chief Prosecutors joined the United States\r\nChief of Counsel in a motion formally designating Alfried Krupp a\r\ndefendant. On the following day the Tribunal announced its ruling\r\nrejecting the motion to add the name of Alfried Krupp as a defendant.\r\n\r\nThe significant papers pertaining to these questions are set forth\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n A. _MOTION BY DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS AGAINST\r\n                  GUSTAV KRUPP VON BOHLEN UND HALBACH_\r\n\r\n                                              Nurnberg, 4 November 1945\r\n\r\nTHEODOR KLEFISCH\r\nLAWYER\r\nCOLOGNE, 43, BLUMENTHALSTRASSE\r\n\r\nTo: The International Military Tribunal Nurnberg.\r\n\r\nAs defending counsel to the accused Dr. Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und\r\nHalbach I beg to state that the proceedings against this accused be\r\ndeferred until he is again fit for trial.\r\n\r\nAt any rate I request that the accused be not tried in his absence.\r\n\r\n                               _Reasons_\r\n\r\nBy Article 12 of the Statute of the International Military Tribunal this\r\ncourt has the right to try an accused in his absence if he cannot be\r\nfound, or if the court deem this necessary for other reasons in the\r\ninterest of justice.\r\n\r\nThe 75 year old accused Krupp von Bohlen has for a long time been\r\nincapable of trial or examination owing to his severe physical and\r\nmental infirmities. He is not in a position to be in contact with the\r\noutside world nor to make or receive statements. The indictment was\r\nserved on him on the 19th October 1945 by a representative of the\r\nInternational Military Tribunal by placing the document on his bed. The\r\naccused had no knowledge of this event. Consequently he is not aware of\r\nthe existence of an indictment. Naturally therefore he is not capable of\r\ncommunicating either with his defense counsel nor with other persons on\r\nthe subject of his defense.\r\n\r\nTo prove the above, 2 medical certificates are enclosed viz. that of the\r\ncourt medical expert Doctor Karl Gersdorf of Werfen Salzburg of 9th\r\nSeptember 1945 and that of the Professor Doctor Otto Gerke of Bedgnstein\r\nof 13th September.\r\n\r\nLatterly Herr Krupp von Bohlen has been examined several times by\r\nAmerican military doctors. As far as it is possible I should like to\r\nrequest for another complete medical examination. If the accused is\r\nunable to appear before the court, then according to article 12 of the\r\nstatute he could only be tried if the court deemed it necessary in the\r\ninterests of justice.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be understood by the phrase “in the interests of justice”\r\nit would hardly be objective justice to try a defendant accused of such\r\nserious crimes, if he were not informed of the contents of the\r\naccusations or if he were not given the chance to conduct his own\r\ndefense or instruct a defense counsel. Particularly is he in no\r\ncondition to comprehend the following rights of an accused set out in\r\nthe statute:\r\n\r\n1. By article 16 Section (a) of the statute a copy of the indictment in\r\na language which he understands will be served on the accused at a\r\nsuitably appointed time. In the first place this concerns the statement\r\nwhich the accused has to render on inquiry as to whether he admits his\r\nguilt or not, a statement which is of particular importance for the\r\ncourse of the trial and for the decision of the tribunal. This is all\r\nthe more important as this statement regarding guilt or innocence can\r\nonly be made exclusively by the accused himself according to his own\r\njudgment and after examining his conscience. So far as the procedure is\r\nadmissible at all, the defense counsel could not at the request of the\r\ncourt express himself on the question of guilt as such a declaration\r\npresupposes the possibility of communication and understanding with the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nAlso the defendant could not exercise the right to the last word to\r\nwhich he is entitled according to Article 24 Section f.\r\n\r\nThe legislators who set up these guarantees for the defense, cannot wish\r\nto deny them undeservedly to an accused who cannot make use of them\r\nowing to illness. If by Article 12 of the statute the trial of an absent\r\ndefendant is allowed then this exception to the rule can only be applied\r\nto a defendant who is unwilling to appear though able to do so. As is\r\nthe case with the criminal procedure rules of nearly all countries, it\r\nis on this principle that the rules and regulations concerning the trial\r\nof absent defendants are based.\r\n\r\n                                                   [signed]  Klefisch\r\n                                                                 Lawyer\r\nB. _ANSWER FOR THE UNITED STATES TO THE MOTION FILED IN BEHALF OF KRUPP\r\n                              VON BOHLEN_\r\n\r\nTo the International Military Tribunal:\r\n\r\nThe United States respectfully opposes the application on behalf of\r\nGustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach that his trial be “deferred until he\r\nis again fit for trial.”\r\n\r\nIf the Tribunal should grant this application, the practical effect\r\nwould be to quash all proceedings, for all time, against Krupp von\r\nBohlen.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Krupp should not be arrested and brought to the court\r\nroom for trial. But the plea is that the Tribunal also excuse him from\r\nbeing tried _in absentia_. This form of trial admittedly is authorized\r\nby Article 12 of the Charter of the Tribunal. Of course, trial _in\r\nabsentia_ in the circumstances of the case is an unsatisfactory\r\nproceeding either for prosecution or for defense. But the request that\r\nKrupp von Bohlen be neither brought to court nor tried in his absence is\r\nbased on the contention that “the interest of justice” requires that he\r\nbe thus excused from any form of trial. Public interests, which\r\ntranscend all private considerations, require that Krupp von Bohlen\r\nshall not be dismissed unless some other representative of the Krupp\r\narmament and munitions interests be substituted. These public interests\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\nFour generations of the Krupp family have owned and operated the great\r\narmament and munitions plants which have been the chief source of\r\nGermany’s war supplies. For over 130 years this family has been the\r\nfocus, the symbol, and the beneficiary of the most sinister forces\r\nengaged in menacing the peace of Europe. During the period between the\r\ntwo World Wars the management of these enterprises was chiefly in\r\ndefendant Krupp von Bohlen. It was at all times, however, a Krupp family\r\nenterprise. Krupp von Bohlen was only a nominal owner himself; his wife,\r\nBertha Krupp, owned the bulk of the stock. About 1937 their son, Alfried\r\nKrupp, became plant manager and was actively associated in policy-making\r\nand executive management thereafter. In 1940, Krupp von Bohlen, getting\r\non in years, became Chairman of the Board of the concerns, thus making\r\nway for Alfried, who became President. In 1943, Alfried became sole\r\nowner of the Krupp enterprises by agreement between the family and the\r\nNazi government, for the purpose of perpetuating this business in Krupp\r\nfamily control. It is evident that the future menace of this concern\r\nlies in continuance of the tradition under Alfried, now reported to be\r\nan internee of the British Army of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nTo drop Krupp von Bohlen from this case without substitution of Alfried,\r\ndrops from the case the entire Krupp family, and defeats any effective\r\njudgment against the German armament makers. Whether this would be “in\r\nthe interests of justice” will appear from the following recital of only\r\nthe most significant items of evidence now in possession of the United\r\nStates as to the activities of Krupp von Bohlen, in which his son\r\nAlfried at all times aided, as did other associates in the vast armament\r\nenterprises, all plotting to bring about the second World War, and to\r\naid in its ruthless and illegal conduct.\r\n\r\nAfter the first World War, the Krupp family and their associates failed\r\nto comply with Germany’s disarmament agreements, but all secretly and\r\nknowingly conspired to evade them.\r\n\r\nIn the March 1, 1940 issue of the Krupp Magazine, the defendant Krupp\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “I wanted and had to maintain Krupp in spite of all opposition,\r\n    as an armament plant for the later future, even if in\r\n    camouflaged form. I could only speak in the smallest, most\r\n    intimate circles, about the real reasons which made me undertake\r\n    the changeover of the plants for certain lines of production. *\r\n    * * Even the Allied snoop commissioners were duped. * * * After\r\n    the accession to power of Adolf Hitler, I had the satisfaction\r\n    of reporting to the Fuehrer that Krupp stood ready, after a\r\n    short warming-up period, to begin rearmament of the German\r\n    people without any gaps of experience * * *”\r\n\r\nKrupp von Bohlen (and Alfried Krupp as well) lent his name, prestige,\r\nand financial support to bring the Nazi Party, with an avowed program of\r\nrenewing the war, into power over the German State. On April 25, 1931\r\nvon Bohlen acted as chairman of the Association of German Industry to\r\nbring it into line with Nazi policies. On May 30, 1933 he wrote to\r\nSchacht that “it is proposed to initiate a collection in the most\r\nfar-reaching circles of German industry, including agriculture and the\r\nbanking world, which is to be put at the disposal of the Fuehrer of the\r\nNSDAP in the name of ‘The Hitler Fund’ * * * I have accepted the\r\nchairmanship of the management council.” Krupp contributed from the\r\ntreasury of the main Krupp company 4,738,446 Marks to the Nazi Party\r\nfund. In June, 1935 he contributed 100,000 Marks to the Nazi Party out\r\nof his personal account.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party did not succeed in obtaining control of Germany until it\r\nobtained support of the industrial interests, largely through the\r\ninfluence of Krupp. Alfried first became a Nazi Party member and later\r\nvon Bohlen did also. The Krupp influence was powerful in promoting the\r\nNazi plan to incite aggressive warfare in Europe.\r\n\r\nKrupp von Bohlen strongly advocated and supported Germany’s withdrawal\r\nfrom the Disarmament Conference and from the League of Nations. He\r\npersonally made repeated public speeches approving and inciting Hitler’s\r\nprogram of aggression; on April 6th and 7th, 1938 two speeches approved\r\nannexation of Austria; on October 13, 1938 he publicly approved Nazi\r\noccupation of the Sudetenland; on September 4, 1939 he approved the\r\ninvasion of Poland; on May 6, 1941 he spoke commemorating the success of\r\nNazi arms in the West. Alfried Krupp also made speeches to the same\r\ngeneral effect. The Krupps were thus one of the most persistent and\r\ninfluential forces that made this war.\r\n\r\nThe Krupps also were the chief factor in getting ready for the war. In\r\nJanuary, 1944 in a speech at the University of Berlin, von Bohlen\r\nboasted, “Through years of secret work, scientific and basic groundwork\r\nwas laid in order to be ready again to work for the German Armed Forces\r\nat the appointed hour without loss of time or experience.” In 1937,\r\nbefore Germany went to war, the Krupps booked orders to equip satellite\r\ngovernments on approval of the German High Command. Krupp contributed\r\n20,000 Marks to the defendant Rosenberg for the purpose of spreading\r\nNazi propaganda abroad. In a memorandum of October 12, 1939, a Krupp\r\nofficial wrote offering to mail propaganda pamphlets abroad at Krupp\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nOnce the war was on, Krupps, both von Bohlen and Alfried being directly\r\nresponsible therefor, led German industry in violating treaties and\r\nInternational Law by employing enslaved laborers, impressed and imported\r\nfrom nearly every country occupied by Germany, and by compelling\r\nprisoners of war to make arms and munitions for use against their own\r\ncountries. There is ample evidence that in Krupp’s custody and service\r\nthey were underfed and overworked, misused and inhumanly treated.\r\nCaptured records show that in September, 1944, Krupp concerns were\r\nworking 54,990 foreign workers and 18,902 prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Krupp companies profited greatly from destroying the peace\r\nof the world through support of the Nazi program. The rearmament of\r\nGermany gave Krupp huge orders and corresponding profits. Before this\r\nNazi menace to the peace began, the Krupps were operating at a\r\nsubstantial loss. But the net profits after taxes, gifts and reserves\r\nsteadily rose with rise of Nazi rearmament, being as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                      _Marks_\r\n         For year ending Sept. 30, 1935                57,216,392\r\n         For year ending Sept. 30, 1938                97,071,632\r\n         For year ending Sept. 30, 1941               111,555,216\r\n\r\nThe book value of the Krupp concerns mounted from 75,962,000 Marks on\r\nOctober 1, 1933 to 237,316,093 Marks on October 1, 1943. Even this\r\nincluded many going concerns in occupied countries carried at a book\r\nvalue of only 1 Mark each. These figures are subject to the adjustments\r\nand controversies usual with financial statements of each vast\r\nenterprise but approximately reflect the facts about property and\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe services of Alfried Krupp and of von Bohlen and their family to the\r\nwar aims of the Nazi Party were so outstanding that the Krupp\r\nenterprises were made a special exception to the policy of\r\nnationalization of industries. Hitler said that he would be “prepared to\r\narrange for any possible safeguarding for the continued existence of the\r\nworks as a family enterprise; it would be simplest to issue ‘lex Krupp’\r\nto start with.” After short negotiations, this was done. A decree of\r\nNovember 12, 1943 preserves the Krupp works as a family enterprise in\r\nAlfried Krupp’s control and recites that it is done in recognition of\r\nthe fact that “for 132 years the firm of Fried. Krupp, as a family\r\nenterprise has achieved outstanding and unique merits for the armed\r\nstrength of the German people.”\r\n\r\nIt has at all times been the position of the United States that the\r\ngreat industrialists of Germany were guilty of the crimes charged in\r\nthis Indictment quite as much as its politicians, diplomats, and\r\nsoldiers. Its Chief of Counsel on June 7, 1945, in a report to President\r\nTruman, released by him and with his approval, stated that the\r\naccusations of crimes include individuals in authority in the financial,\r\nindustrial, and economic life of Germany, as well as others.\r\n\r\nPursuant thereto, the United States, with approval of the Secretary of\r\nState, proposed to indict Alfried Krupp, son of Krupp von Bohlen, and\r\nPresident and owner of the Krupp concern. The Prosecutors representing\r\nthe Soviet Union, the French Republic, and the United Kingdom\r\nunanimously opposed inclusion of Alfried Krupp. This is not said in\r\ncriticism of them or their judgment. The necessity of limiting the\r\nnumber of defendants was considered by representatives of the other\r\nthree nations to preclude the addition of Alfried Krupp. Learning the\r\nserious condition of Krupp von Bohlen, immediately upon service of the\r\nIndictment, the United States again called a meeting of Prosecutors and\r\nproposed an amendment to include Alfried Krupp. Again the proposal of\r\nthe United States was defeated by a vote of three-to-one. If now the\r\nTribunal shall exercise its discretion to excuse from trial the one\r\nindicted member of the Krupp family, one of the chief purposes of the\r\nUnited States will be defeated, and it is submitted that such a result\r\nis not “in the interests of justice.”\r\n\r\nThe United States respectfully submits that no greater disservice to the\r\nfuture peace of the world could be done than to excuse the entire Krupp\r\nfamily and the armament enterprise from this trial in which aggressive\r\nwar-making is sought to be condemned. The “interests of justice” cannot\r\nbe determined without taking into account justice to the men of four\r\ngenerations whose lives have been taken or menaced by Krupp munitions\r\nand Krupp armament, and those of the future who can feel no safety if\r\nsuch persons as this escape all condemnation in proceedings such as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWhile of course the United States can not, without the concurrence of\r\none other power, indict a new defendant, it can under the Charter alone\r\noppose this Motion. The United States respectfully urges that if the\r\nfavor now sought by Krupp von Bohlen is to be granted, it be upon the\r\ncondition that Alfried Krupp be substituted or added as a defendant so\r\nthat there may be a representative of the Krupp interests before the\r\nTribunal.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that bringing in a new defendant would result in\r\ndelay. Admitting, however, that a delay which cannot exceed a few days\r\nmay be occasioned, it is respectfully suggested that the precise day\r\nthat this trial will start is a less important consideration than\r\nwhether it is to fail of one of its principal purposes. The American\r\nProsecution Staff has been by long odds the longest and farthest away\r\nfrom home in this endeavor. On personal, as well as public interest\r\nconsiderations, it deplores delay. But we think the future, as well as\r\nthe contemporary world, cannot fail to be shocked if, in a trial in\r\nwhich it is sought to condemn aggressive war-making, the Krupp\r\nindustrial empire is completely saved from condemnation.\r\n\r\nThe complete trial brief of the United States on Krupp von Bohlen, with\r\ncopies of the documents on which his culpability is asserted, will be\r\nmade available to the Tribunal if it is desired as evidence concerning\r\nhim and Alfried Krupp and the Krupp concerns.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted:\r\n\r\n                                           [signed]  Robert H. Jackson\r\n                                                    ROBERT H. JACKSON,\r\n                     Chief of Counsel for the United States of America.\r\n 12 November 1945.\r\n            C. _RULING OF THE TRIBUNAL ON 15 NOVEMBER 1945_\r\n\r\n  IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF COUNSEL FOR KRUPP VON BOHLEN FOR\r\n         POSTPONEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THIS DEFENDANT\r\n\r\nCouncil for Gustav Krupp von Bohlen has applied to the Tribunal for\r\npostponement of the proceedings against this defendant on the ground\r\nthat his physical and mental condition are such that he is incapable of\r\nunderstanding the proceedings against him and of presenting any defence\r\nthat he may have.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, the Tribunal appointed a medical commission composed of\r\nthe following physicians: R. E. Tunbridge, Brigadier, O.B.E., M.D.,\r\nM.Sc., F.R.C.P., Consulting Physician, British Army of the Rhine; Rene\r\nPiedelievre, M.D., professor a la Faculte de Medicine de Paris; Expert\r\npres les Tribuneaux; Nicolas Kurshakov, M.D., Professor of Medicine,\r\nMedical Institute of Moscow; Chief Internist, Commissariat of Public\r\nHealth, U.S.S.R.; Eugene Sepp, M.D., Emeritus Professor of Neurology,\r\nMedical Institute of Moscow; Member, Academy of Sciences, U.S.S.R.;\r\nEugene Krasnushkin, M.D.; Professor of Psychiatry, Medical Institute of\r\nMoscow; Bertram Schaffner, Major, Medical Corps, Neuropsychiatrist, Army\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has reported to the Tribunal that it is unanimously of\r\nthe opinion that Krupp von Bohlen suffers from senile softening of the\r\nbrain; that his mental condition is such that he is incapable of\r\nunderstanding court procedure and of understanding or cooperating in\r\ninterrogations; that his physical state is such that he cannot be moved\r\nwithout endangering his life; and that his condition is unlikely to\r\nimprove but rather will deteriorate further.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal accepts the findings of the medical commission to which\r\nexception is taken neither by the Prosecution nor by the Defense.\r\n\r\nArticle 12 of the Charter authorizes the trial of a defendant _in\r\nabsentia_ if found by the Tribunal to be “necessary in the interests of\r\njustice”. It is contended on behalf of the Chief Prosecutors that in the\r\ninterests of justice Krupp von Bohlen should be tried _in absentia_,\r\ndespite his physical and mental condition.\r\n\r\nIt is the decision of the Tribunal that upon the facts presented the\r\ninterests of justice do not require that Krupp von Bohlen be tried _in\r\nabsentia_. The Charter of the Tribunal envisages a fair trial in which\r\nthe Chief Prosecutors may present the evidence in support of an\r\nindictment and the defendants may present such defence as they may\r\nbelieve themselves to have. Where nature rather than flight or contumacy\r\nhas rendered such a trial impossible, it is not in accordance with\r\njustice that the case should proceed in the absence of a defendant.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal _Orders that_:\r\n\r\n1. The application for postponement of the proceeding against Gustav\r\nKrupp von Bohlen is granted.\r\n\r\n2. The charges in the indictment against Gustav Krupp von Bohlen shall\r\nbe retained upon the docket of the Tribunal for trial hereafter, if the\r\nphysical and mental condition of the Defendant should permit.\r\n\r\nFurther questions raised by the Chief Prosecutors, including the\r\nquestion of adding another name to the Indictment, will be considered\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n      D. _MEMORANDUM FILED BY THE UNITED STATES CHIEF OF COUNSEL_\r\n\r\nTO THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL\r\n\r\nThe United States, by its Chief of Counsel, respectfully shows:\r\n\r\nThe order of the Tribunal, that “The charges in the indictment against\r\nGustav Krupp von Bohlen shall be retained upon the docket of the\r\nTribunal for trial hereafter, if the physical and mental condition of\r\nthe Defendant should permit,” requires the United States to make clear\r\nits attitude toward subsequent trials, which may have been\r\nmisapprehended by the Tribunal, in order that no inference be drawn from\r\nits silence.\r\n\r\nThe United States never has committed itself to participate in any Four\r\nPower trial except the one now pending. The purpose of accusing\r\norganizations and groups as criminal was to reach, through subsequent\r\nand more expeditious trials before Military Government or military\r\ncourts, a large number of persons. According to estimates of the United\r\nStates Army, a finding that the organizations presently accused are\r\ncriminal organizations would result in the trial of approximately\r\n130,000 persons now held in the custody of the United States Army; and I\r\nam uninformed as to those held by others. It has been the great purpose\r\nof the United States from the beginning to bring into this one trial all\r\nthat is necessary by way of defendants and evidence to reach the large\r\nnumber of persons responsible for the crimes charged without going over\r\nthe entire evidence again. We, therefore, desire that it be a matter of\r\nrecord that the United States has not been, and is not by this order,\r\ncommitted to participate in any subsequent Four Power trial. It reserves\r\nfreedom to determine that question after the capacity to handle one\r\ntrial under difficult conditions has been tested.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted:\r\n\r\n                                          [signed]  Robert H.

For this purpose, the Committee of Prosecutors\r\nadopts and ratifies the Answer filed on behalf of the United States on\r\nNovember 12, 1945 in response to the Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach\r\nmotion, and the motion made by Robert H. Jackson in open Court on behalf\r\nof the United States of America, The Soviet Union, and The Provisional\r\nGovernment of France. This motion is authorized by a resolution adopted\r\nat a meeting of the Committee of Prosecutors held on November 16, 1945.\r\n\r\n                                                  [signed]  Pokrovsky\r\n                            For the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\r\n                                        [signed]  Francois de Menthon\r\n                               For the Provisional Government of France\r\n                                          [signed]  Robert H.

MARTIN BORMANN\r\n\r\nAs the day of the trial approached, Martin Bormann, although named as a\r\ndefendant in the Indictment, had not yet been apprehended despite the\r\nefforts of numerous special investigators. On 17 November 1945 the\r\nTribunal requested the views of the prosecution on the question of trial\r\n_in absentia_. Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of Great\r\nBritain, reviewed the information available and, on behalf of the United\r\nStates and France as well as Great Britain, stated that: “The\r\nprosecution cannot say that the matter is beyond a probability that\r\nBormann is dead. There is still the clear possibility that he is alive.”\r\nNotice had been publicly given, in the manner prescribed by the\r\nTribunal, that Bormann had been named a defendant, and it was therefore\r\nsuggested that the case fell within Article 12 of the Charter\r\nauthorizing trial _in absentia_. The Soviet representative expressed\r\nconcurrence; whereupon Lord Justice Lawrence, presiding, orally\r\nannounced the Tribunal’s ruling, on the same date:\r\n\r\n    “The Tribunal has decided that, in pursuance of Article 12 of\r\n    the Charter, it will try the Defendant Bormann in his absence,\r\n    and it announces that counsel for the Defendant Bormann will be\r\n    appointed to defend him.”\r\n\r\nThereafter, the counsel named to defend Bormann moved for postponement\r\nof the proceedings against the defendant. The Tribunal announced on 22\r\nNovember through Lord Justice Lawrence, presiding, that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * in view of the fact that the provisions of the Charter\r\n    and the Tribunal’s rule of procedure have been strictly carried\r\n    out in the notices which have been given, and the fact that\r\n    counsel for Bormann will have ample time before they are called\r\n    upon to present defense on his behalf, the motion is denied.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         4. ERNST KALTENBRUNNER\r\n\r\nOn 18 November 1945, two days before the opening of the trial,\r\nKaltenbrunner suffered a spontaneous subarachanoid hemorrhage and was\r\ntaken to the hospital for treatment. He remained there until 6 December,\r\nwhen he was returned to the jail. He attended the 10 December session of\r\nthe Tribunal and was in court for several days thereafter, but his\r\ncondition deteriorated so that it was necessary to return him to the\r\nhospital for further treatment. Medical opinion expects at this writing\r\n(23 January), that he will be required to remain under hospital care for\r\na considerable period.\r\n\r\nOn 2 January Kaltenbrunner’s counsel, Dr. Kauffmann, requested the\r\nTribunal to postpone the case against his client because of his illness.\r\nThe Tribunal ruled (1) that the prosecution should proceed with any\r\nevidence which it proposed to direct against the criminality of\r\norganizations with which Kaltenbrunner was connected, (2) that any\r\nprosecution evidence directed against Kaltenbrunner as an individual\r\nshould be withheld until the prosecution reached that part of its case\r\nin which it had planned to trace the responsibility of individual\r\ndefendants, and (3) that Kaltenbrunner’s case should properly be left\r\nuntil the end of this section of the evidence. If at that time the\r\ndefendant should be still unable to be present in court, the Tribunal\r\nruled that “the evidence will have to be given in his absence.”\r\n\r\nA closed session followed at which the Tribunal heard both the\r\nprosecution and defense counsel, as a result of which the Tribunal\r\nmodified its ruling. Since the prosecution’s evidence was so\r\ninextricably mingled that it was impossible to divide it between that\r\nwhich bore against Kaltenbrunner as an individual and that which bore\r\nagainst the organizations which he headed, the Tribunal ruled that it\r\nwould hear the prosecution’s evidence in its entirety. Counsel for\r\nKaltenbrunner, however, was given the privilege of cross-examining at a\r\nlater date any witnesses which the prosecution might call against\r\nKaltenbrunner. The Tribunal pointed out that defense counsel would also,\r\nof course, have an opportunity to deal with any documentary evidence\r\nagainst Kaltenbrunner when the time came for the presentation of the\r\ndefense case.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          5. JULIUS STREICHER\r\n\r\nCounsel for Streicher orally requested the Tribunal, on 15 November\r\n1945, to appoint a commission to make a psychiatric examination of the\r\ndefendant. This was requested for the Defense Counsel’s “own\r\nprotection”, although the defendant thought himself normal and did not\r\nwish an examination. The Tribunal directed the Defense Counsel to make\r\nhis motion in writing. The Soviet prosecutor suggested to the Tribunal\r\nthe desirability of having such an examination, if it were necessary at\r\nall, while medical experts from the Soviet Union remained in Nurnberg.\r\nSubsequently a panel of three medical experts examined Streicher and\r\nreported that he was fit to stand trial. The Tribunal thereupon ruled,\r\nLord Justice Lawrence making the announcement orally in court on 22\r\nNovember, that\r\n\r\n    “* * * the Tribunal wishes me to announce the decision on the\r\n    application made on behalf of the Defendant Julius Streicher by\r\n    his counsel that his condition should be examined. It has been\r\n    examined by three medical experts on behalf of the Tribunal and\r\n    their report has been submitted to and considered by the\r\n    Tribunal; and it is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “‘1. The Defendant Julius Streicher is sane.\r\n\r\n    “‘2. The Defendant Julius Streicher is fit to appear before the\r\n    Tribunal, and to present his defense.\r\n\r\n    “‘3. It being the unanimous conclusion of the examiners that\r\n    Julius Streicher is sane, he is for that reason capable of\r\n    understanding the nature and policy of his acts during the\r\n    period of time covered by the indictment.’\r\n\r\n    “The Tribunal accepts the report of the medical experts and the\r\n    trial against Julius Streicher will, therefore, proceed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             6. RUDOLF HESS\r\n\r\nThrough his pre-trial confinement in the Nurnberg prison, Hess had\r\nconsistently maintained that he was suffering from amnesia and therefore\r\ncould not remember facts concerning his previous activities. In order to\r\ndetermine Hess’ mental state the Tribunal appointed a commission of\r\npsychiatric experts from the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and\r\nFrance, to examine the defendant and furnish a report. After receiving\r\nthe medical report the Tribunal directed that oral argument by the\r\nprosecution and defense counsel should be heard on 30 November 1945\r\nconcerning the issues raised by the medical report. Prior to the oral\r\nargument, both the prosecution and defense filed written motions which\r\noutlined substantially the positions later taken in court.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the oral arguments, the Tribunal called upon Hess\r\nfor a statement. Hess thereupon announced that he had simulated loss of\r\nmemory for tactical reasons and that his memory was “again in order.” On\r\nthe following day the Tribunal ruled that Hess was capable of standing\r\ntrial and that his case would proceed.\r\n\r\nThe papers pertaining to these matters are set out below.\r\n\r\nA. _RULING OF THE TRIBUNAL ORDERING ARGUMENT ON THE ISSUES PRESENTED BY\r\n                          THE MEDICAL REPORTS_\r\n\r\n1. Counsel for the defendant Hess has made application to the Tribunal\r\nto appoint an expert designated by the medical faculty of the University\r\nof Zurich or of Lausanne to examine the defendant Hess with reference to\r\nhis mental competence and capacity to stand trial. This application is\r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n2. The Tribunal has designated a commission composed of the following\r\nmembers:\r\n\r\n    Eugene Krasnuchkin, M.D., Professor Psychiatry,\r\n      Medical Institute of Moscow, assisted by\r\n    Eugene Sepp, M.D., Professor Neurology,\r\n      Medical Institute of Moscow\r\n      Member, Academy of Medical Sciences, USSR; and,\r\n    Nicolas Kuraskov, M.D., Professor of Medicine\r\n      Medical Institute of Moscow,\r\n      Chief Internist, Commissariat of Public Health, USSR.\r\n    Lord Moran, M.D., F.R.C.P.\r\n      President of the Royal College of Physicians, assisted by\r\n    Dr. T. Reece, M.D., F.R.C.P.\r\n      Chief Consultant Psychiatrist to the War Office, and\r\n    Dr. George Ruddock, M.D., F.R.C.P.\r\n      Director of Neurology to the London Hospital and\r\n      Chief Consultant Neurologist to the War Office\r\n    Dr. Nolan D. C. Lewis, assisted by\r\n    Dr. D. Ewen Cameron and\r\n    Col. Paul Schroeder, M.D.\r\n    Professor Jean Delay.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal has requested the commission to examine the defendant Hess\r\nand furnish a report on the mental state of the defendant with\r\nparticular reference to the question whether he is able to take his part\r\nin the trial, specifically: (1) Is the defendant able to plead to the\r\nindictment? (2) Is the defendant sane or not, and on this last issue the\r\nTribunal wishes to be advised whether the defendant is of sufficient\r\nintellect to comprehend the course of the proceedings of the trial so as\r\nto make a proper defense, to challenge a witness to whom he might wish\r\nto object and to understand the details of the evidence.\r\n\r\n3. The examiners have presented their reports to the Tribunal in the\r\nform which commends itself to them. It is directed that copies of the\r\nreports be furnished to each of the Chief Prosecutors and to defense\r\ncounsel. The Tribunal will hear argument by the Prosecution and by\r\ndefense counsel on the issues presented by the reports on Friday,\r\nNovember 30 at 4 P. M.\r\n\r\n                    INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL\r\n                                          [signed]  Geoffrey Lawrence\r\n                                                    Geoffrey Lawrence\r\n                                                              President\r\n Dated Nurnberg, Germany this 24th day of November, 1945\r\n Copies of four (4) Medical Reports attached:\r\n                      _(1) British Medical Report_\r\n\r\nREPORT on Rudolf Hess, telephoned from London.\r\n\r\n“The undersigned, having seen and examined Rudolf Hess, have come to the\r\nfollowing conclusion:\r\n\r\n1. There are no relevant physical abnormalities.\r\n\r\n2. His mental state is of a mixed type. He is an unstable man, and what\r\nis technically called a psychopathic personality. The evidence of his\r\nillness in the past four years, as presented by one of us who has had\r\nhim under his care in England, indicates that he has had a delusion of\r\npoisoning, and other similar paranoid ideas.\r\n\r\nPartly as a reaction to the failure of his mission, these abnormalities\r\ngot worse, and led to suicidal attempts.\r\n\r\nIn addition, he has a marked hysterical tendency, which has led to the\r\ndevelopment of various symptoms, notably a loss of memory, which lasted\r\nfrom November 1943 to June 1944, and which resisted all efforts at\r\ntreatment. A second loss of memory began in February 1945 and lasted\r\ntill the present. This amnesic symptom will eventually clear, when\r\ncircumstances change.\r\n\r\n3. At the moment he is not insane in the strict sense. His loss of\r\nmemory will not entirely interfere with his comprehension of the\r\nproceedings, but it will interfere with his ability to make his defense,\r\nand to understand details of the past, which arise in evidence.\r\n\r\n4. We recommend that further evidence should be obtained by\r\nnarco-analysis and that if the Court decides to proceed with the Trial,\r\nthe question should afterwards be reviewed on psychiatric grounds.”\r\n\r\n                                                        [signed]  Moran\r\n                                                      J.

L. Mitchell, General Secretary for\r\nthe International Military Tribunal.\r\n\r\nIn response to request of the Tribunal that the defendant Rudolf Hess be\r\nexamined, the undersigned psychiatrists examined Rudolf Hess on November\r\n15th and 19th, 1945, in his cell in the Military Prison in Nurnberg.\r\n\r\nThe following examinations were made: physical, neurological and\r\npsychological.\r\n\r\nIn addition, documents were studied bearing information concerning his\r\npersonal development and career. Reports concerning the period of his\r\nstay in England were scrutinized. The results of all psychological,\r\nspecial psychometric examinations and observations carried out by the\r\nprison psychiatrist and his staff were studied. Information was also\r\nderived from the official interrogation of the defendant on November\r\n14th and November 16th, 1945.\r\n\r\n(1) We find, as a result of our examinations and investigations, that\r\nRudolf Hess is suffering from hysteria characterized in part by loss of\r\nmemory. The nature of this loss of memory is such that it will not\r\ninterfere with his comprehension of the proceedings, but it will\r\ninterfere with his response to questions relating to his past and will\r\ninterfere with his undertaking his defense.\r\n\r\nIn addition there is a conscious exaggeration of his loss of memory and\r\na tendency to exploit it to protect himself against examination.\r\n\r\n(2) We consider that the existing hysterical behaviour which the\r\ndefendant reveals was initiated as a defense against the circumstances\r\nin which he found himself while in England; that it has now become in\r\npart habitual and that it will continue as long as he remains under the\r\nthreat of imminent punishment, even though it may interfere with his\r\nundertaking a more normal form of defense.\r\n\r\n(3) It is the unanimous conclusion of the undersigned that Rudolf Hess\r\nis not insane at the present time in the strict sense of the word.\r\n\r\n                                                 (s)  D.

No essential physical deviations from normality were observed.\r\n\r\n2. His mental conditions are of a mixed type. He is an unstable person,\r\nwhich in technical terms is called a psychopathic personality. The data\r\nconcerning his illness during the period of the last four years\r\nsubmitted by one of us who had him under observation in England, show\r\nthat he had a delusion of being poisoned and other similar paranoic\r\nnotions.\r\n\r\nPartly as a reaction to the failure of his mission there, the abnormal\r\nmanifestations increased and led to attempts at suicide. In addition to\r\nthe above-mentioned he has noticeable hysterical tendencies which caused\r\na development of various symptoms, primarily, of amnesia that lasted\r\nfrom November 1943 to June of 1944 and resisted all attempts to be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nThe amnesia symptom may disappear with changing circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe second period of amnesia started in February of 1945 and has lasted\r\nup through the present.\r\n\r\n3. At present he is not insane in the strict sense of the word. His\r\namnesia does not prevent him completely from understanding what is going\r\non around him but it will interfere with his ability to conduct his\r\ndefense and to understand details of the past which would appear as\r\nfactual data.\r\n\r\n4. To clarify the situation we recommend that a narco-analysis be\r\nperformed on him and, if the Court decides to submit him to trial, the\r\nproblem should be subsequently reexamined again from a psychiatric point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion reached on November 14 by the physicians of the British\r\nDelegation, Lord Moran, Dr. T. Rees and Dr. G. Riddoch, and the\r\nphysicians of the Soviet Delegation, Professors Krasnushkin, Sepp, and\r\nKurshakov, was also arrived at on November 15 by the representative of\r\nthe French Delegation, Professor Jean Delay.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination of Mr. Hess which took place on November 15, 1945,\r\nthe undersigned Professors and experts of the Soviet Delegation,\r\nKrasnushkin, Sepp and Kurshakov, and Professor Jean Delay, the expert\r\nfrom the French Delegation, have agreed on the following statement:\r\n\r\nMr. Hess categorically refused to be submitted to narco-analysis and\r\nresisted all other procedures intended to effect a cure of his amnesia,\r\nand stated that he would agree to undergo treatment only after the\r\ntrial. The behavior of Mr. Hess makes it impossible to apply the methods\r\nsuggested in Paragraph 4 of the report of November 14 and to follow the\r\nsuggestion of that Paragraph in present form.\r\n\r\n                                     (signed)  Professor Krasnushkin,\r\n                                                     Doctor of Medicine\r\n                                            (signed)  Professor Sepp,\r\n                              Honorary Scientist, Regular Member of the\r\n                                                    Academy of Medicine\r\n                                       (signed)  Professor Kurshakov,\r\n                           Doctor of Medicine, Chief Theraputist of the\r\n                                 Commissariat of Health of the U.S.S.R.\r\n                                       (signed)  Professor Jean Delay\r\n                                     of the School of Medicine in Paris\r\n November 16, 1945\r\n               (_b_) Record of Examination of Rudolf Hess\r\n\r\nAccording to the information obtained on Nov. 16, 1945, during the\r\ninterrogation of Rosenberg who had seen Hess immediately before the\r\nlatter’s flight to England, Hess gave no evidence of any abnormality\r\neither in appearance or conversation. He was, as usual, quiet and\r\ncomposed. Nor was it apparent that he might have been nervous. Prior to\r\nthis, he was a calm person, habitually suffering pains in the region of\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\nAs can be judged on the basis of the report of the English psychiatrist,\r\nDoctor Rees, who had Hess under observation from the first days of his\r\nflight to England, Hess, after the airplane crash, disclosed no evidence\r\nof a brain injury, but, upon arrest and incarceration, he began to give\r\nexpression to ideas of persecution. He feared that he would be poisoned,\r\nor killed and his death represented as a suicide, and that all this\r\nwould be done by the English under the hypnotic influence of the Jews.\r\nFurthermore, these delusions of persecution were maintained up to the\r\nnews of the catastrophe suffered by the German Army at Stalingrad when\r\nthe manifestations were replaced by amnesia. According to Doctor Rees,\r\nthe delusions of persecution and the amnesia were observed not to take\r\nplace simultaneously. Furthermore, there were two attempts at suicide. A\r\nknife wound, inflicted during the second attempt, in the skin near the\r\nheart gave evidence of a clearly hysterico-demonstrative character.\r\nAfter this there was again observed a change from amnesia to delusions\r\nof persecution, and during this period he wrote that he was simulating\r\nhis amnesia, and, finally, again entered into a state of amnesia which\r\nhas been prolonged up to the present.\r\n\r\nAccording to the examination of Rudolf Hess on Nov. 14, 1945, the\r\nfollowing was disclosed.\r\n\r\nHess complains of frequent cramping pains in the region of the stomach\r\nwhich appear independent of the taking of food, and headaches in the\r\nfrontal lobes during mental strain, and, finally, of loss of memory.\r\n\r\nIn general his condition is marked by a pallor of the skin and a\r\nnoticeable reduction in food intake.\r\n\r\nRegarding the internal organs of Hess, the pulse is 92, and a shakening\r\nof the heart tone is noticeable. There has been no change in the\r\ncondition of the other internal organs.\r\n\r\nConcerning the neurological aspect, there are no symptoms of organic\r\nimpairment of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nPsychologically, Hess is in a state of clear consciousness; knows that\r\nhe is in prison at Nurnberg under indictment as a war criminal; has\r\nread, and, according to his own words, is acquainted with the charges\r\nagainst him. He answers questions rapidly and to the point. His speech\r\nis coherent, his thoughts formed with precision and correctness and they\r\nare accompanied by sufficient emotionally expressive movements. Also,\r\nthere is no kind of evidence of paralogism. It should also be noted\r\nhere, that the present psychological examination, which was conducted by\r\nLieut. Gilbert, M.D., bears out the testimony that the intelligence of\r\nHess is normal and in some instances above the average. His movements\r\nare natural and not forced.\r\n\r\nHe has expressed no delirious fancies nor does he give any delirious\r\nexplanation for the painful sensation in his stomach or the loss of\r\nmemory, as was previously attested to by Doctor Rees, namely, when Hess\r\nascribed them to poisoning. At the present time, to the question about\r\nthe reason for his painful sensations and the loss of memory, Hess\r\nanswers that this is for the doctors to know. According to his own\r\nassertions, he can remember almost nothing of his former life. The gaps\r\nin Hess’ memory are ascertained only on the basis of the subjective\r\nchanging of his testimony about his inability to remember this or that\r\nperson or event given at different times. What he knows at the present\r\ntime is, in his own words, what he allegedly learned only recently from\r\nthe information of those around him and the films which have been shown\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 14 Hess refused the injection of narcotics which were offered\r\nfor the purpose of making an analysis of his psychological condition. On\r\nNov. 15, in answer to Prof. Delay’s offer, he definitely and firmly\r\nrefused narcosis and explained to him that, in general, he would take\r\nall measures to cure his amnesia only upon completion of the trial.\r\n\r\nAll that has been exposed above, we are convinced, permits, of the\r\ninterpretation that the deviation from the norm in the behavior of Hess\r\ntakes the following forms:\r\n\r\nI. In the psychological personality of Hess there are no changes typical\r\nof the progressive schizophrenic disease, and therefore the delusions,\r\nfrom which he suffered periodically while in England, cannot be\r\nconsidered as manifestations of a schizophrenic paranoia, and must be\r\nrecognized as the expression of a psychogenic paranoic reaction, that\r\nis, the psychologically comprehensible reaction of an unstable\r\n(psychologically) personality to the situation (the failure of his\r\nmission, arrest and incarceration). Such an interpretation of the\r\ndelirious statements of Hess in England is bespoken by their\r\ndisappearance, appearance and repeated disappearance depending on\r\nexternal circumstances which affected the mental state of Hess.\r\n\r\nII. The loss of memory of Hess is not the result of some kind of mental\r\ndisease but represents hysterical amnesia, the basis of which is a\r\nsubconscious inclination toward self-defense as well as a deliberate and\r\nconscious tendency toward it. Such behavior often terminates when the\r\nhysterical person is faced with an unavoidable necessity of conducting\r\nhimself correctly. Therefore, the amnesia of Hess may end upon his being\r\nbrought to trial.\r\n\r\nIII. Rudolf Hess, prior to his flight to England, did not suffer from\r\nany kind of insanity, nor is he now suffering from it. At the present\r\ntime he exhibits hysterical behavior with signs of a\r\nconscious-intentional (simulated) character, which does not exonerate\r\nhim from his responsibility under the indictment.\r\n\r\n                                     (signed)  Professor Krasnushkin,\r\n                                                     Doctor of Medicine\r\n                                            (signed)  Professor Sepp,\r\n                              Honorary Scientist, Regular Member of the\r\n                                                    Academy of Medicine\r\n                                       (signed)  Professor Kurshakov,\r\n                           Doctor of Medicine, Chief Theraputist of the\r\n                                 Commissariat of Health of the U.S.S.R.\r\n 17 November 1945\r\n B. _MOTION BY DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS AGAINST\r\n                                 HESS_\r\n\r\nAttorney-at-law von Rohrscheidt\r\nDefense Counsel for Rudolf Hess\r\n\r\n                                             Nurnberg, 29 November 1945\r\n\r\nTo the General Secretary of the International Military Tribunal,\r\nNurnberg:\r\n\r\n_Reference: Rudolf Hess—Session of 30 November 1945._\r\n\r\nI. Reply to the request of the Tribunal of 28 November 1945.\r\n\r\nII. Preparatory statement for the trial.\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nI, as Counsel for the Defendant Hess, answer the request of the Tribunal\r\nof 28 November 1945 as follows:\r\n\r\n1. No formal objection is being raised by Defense against presentation\r\nand use of the expert opinions obtained by the Tribunal.\r\n\r\n2. The Defense does not think the defendant Hess to be\r\n“verhandlungsfaehig” (in a state of health to be tried).\r\n\r\n3. Material objections are being raised by the Defense, inasmuch as the\r\nexpert opinion denies the competence of the defendant as a consequence\r\nof a mental disorder.\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nFor the proceedings, I, as Counsel for the Defendant Hess, wish to make\r\nthe following statement:\r\n\r\n1. _I move_:\r\n\r\n_a._ That a decision be made to adjourn the proceedings against the\r\ndefendant temporarily.\r\n\r\n_b._ That in case incapacity to be tried is asserted, proceedings in\r\nabsentia against the defendant should not be carried on.\r\n\r\n_c._ That in case my motion _ad a_ is rejected, a super expert opinion\r\nbe obtained from additional eminent psychiatrists.\r\n\r\n2. I _argue_ these motions as follows:\r\n\r\n_ad 1-a_:  The adjournment of the proceedings is necessary because of the\r\n           unfitness of the defendant to follow them.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the (medical) opinions state unanimously upon the\r\nquestions asked by the Tribunal, that “the ability of the Defendant Hess\r\nis impaired to the extent that he cannot defend himself, nor oppose a\r\nwitness, nor understand the details of evidence.” Even if the amnesia\r\ndoes not keep him from understanding what happens about him or to\r\nunderstand the course of the trial, this amnesia nevertheless has a\r\ndisturbing effect on his defense.\r\n\r\nThe impairment of the defendant in his defense, through his amnesia,\r\nrecognized by all opinions as a mental defect, has to be acknowledged as\r\nsuch, in view of the statements in the opinions of the Soviet, English\r\nand American Delegations of 14 November 1945, which designate the mental\r\ncondition as one of a mixed kind, but more as one of a sort of mental\r\nabnormality. This will not make a pertinent defense possible for him\r\n(Hess).\r\n\r\nIn this respect, it does not have to be considered that the defendant is\r\nnot mentally ill “in the literal meaning of the word” and that he can\r\nfollow the proceedings. The question whether the defendant is at present\r\nincapable, as a result of the diminution of his “mental powers,” to\r\nunderstand all occurrences and to defend himself properly, has nothing\r\nto do with his mental derangement when committing the crime.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of counsel, the defendant is in no case in a position to\r\nmake himself understood or to understand argument, because he is\r\nimpaired in his mental clarity through the loss of his memory and\r\nbecause he has completely lost the knowledge of previous events and of\r\npeople of former acquaintance.\r\n\r\nSince the expert establishment of his mental disorder which impairs the\r\ndefendant in the full execution of his defense, makes proceedings\r\nagainst him inadmissible, the statement of the defendant that he thinks\r\nhimself capable of being tried has no significance.\r\n\r\nAccording to expert opinion, the impairment of the defendant cannot be\r\nremoved within a measurable space of time. It is not sure whether\r\ntreatment through Narco-Analysis, as proposed by the medical experts,\r\nwill have the desired result. The defendant has refused to submit to\r\nthis treatment only because he thinks of himself as capable of being\r\ntried and consequently not in need of such treatment. Furthermore,\r\nbecause he is opposed to any forcible influence upon the body, and\r\nfinally, he is afraid of physical disturbances which would prevent him\r\nfrom participating in the trial if such method of treatment is used at\r\nthis time. The proceedings would have to be dropped in case of an\r\nillness of long duration which excludes his fitness to be tried.\r\n\r\n_ad 1-b_:  According to Article 12 of the Statutes, the Tribunal has the\r\n           right to proceed against a defendant in absentia if\r\n\r\nhe, the defendant, cannot be located or if the Tribunal thinks it\r\nnecessary, for other reasons, in the interests of justice. If the\r\nTribunal, on the basis of convincing expert opinions, establishes that\r\nthe defendant is not in a position to put up a pertinent defense and\r\nconsequently decides not to proceed against him, proceedings in\r\nabsentia, according to Article 12, could then only be carried on if this\r\nis in the interest of justice. It would not be compatible with objective\r\njustice, in case that actual proof of this fact is available, if the\r\ndefendant is impeded by an impairment based upon health reasons, in\r\npersonally standing up for his rights and in being present at the trial.\r\n\r\nIn proceedings which accuse the defendant of such serious crimes and\r\npossibly carry the death penalty, it would not be compatible with\r\nobjective justice if he were personally denied the opportunity to look\r\nafter his rights as stated in Article 16 of the Statutes. These rights\r\nprovide for his self-defense. The possibility to “personally present\r\nevidence for one’s defense and to cross-examine each witness of the\r\nprosecution” is of such importance that any exclusion of such rights has\r\nto be considered an injustice toward the defendant. Proceedings in\r\nabsentia can, under no circumstances, be accepted as a “fair trial.”\r\n\r\nThe same is true for the exclusion of the defendant from the rights\r\nwhich are granted him during the proceedings according to Article 24.\r\n\r\nIf the defendant is impaired in his ability to defend himself for the\r\nreasons of the expert opinions, and to the extent explained therein,\r\nthen he is just as little in a position to give his Counsel the\r\nnecessary information and to enable him to take care of the defense in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\nSince the Statutes establish the rights for the defense in this precise\r\nmanner, it does not seem fair to withhold these from a defendant in a\r\ncase when he is prevented from personally taking care of his defense\r\nduring the proceedings. The rules in Article 12, regarding the\r\nproceedings against an absent defendant, have to be considered as an\r\nexception which should only be used against a defendant who tries to\r\ndodge in spite of his being in a position to be tried. The Defendant\r\nHess has always been prepared to be tried in order to avoid proceedings\r\nin absentia, which he considers an injustice of the highest measure.\r\n\r\n_ad 1-c_:  In case the Court should not agree with the explanations and\r\n           should not consider the statements of the expert\r\n\r\nopinion in the sense of the defense, and therefore come to a denial of\r\nthe Application ad a, it seems necessary to obtain the super opinion\r\nbecause the opinions testify to the fact that the defendant is a\r\npsychopathic personality who suffers from hallucinations and still today\r\nshows, in the loss of memory, clear signs of a serious hysteria. If the\r\nTribunal does not consider these sentiments alone as sufficient for the\r\nestablishment of incapability to be tried, a more intensive examination\r\nwould have to follow which would not be confined to an examination of\r\nonly one or two hours on several days, but require a clinical\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe opinions, themselves, provide for another examination of the mental\r\ncondition of the defendant, which seems to prove that the experts\r\npossibly have a “disturbance of the mental capacity” in mind if the\r\ncondition of the defendant lasts and the Tribunal, against expectations,\r\ndeclares the defendant unfit to be tried and therewith incompetent under\r\nall circumstances.\r\n\r\n                                            /Signed/  von Rohrscheidt\r\n                                                        Attorney-at-Law\r\n Translator: Dr. H. v.

Kelley of the Medical\r\nCorps of the United States Army, which report is attached hereto.\r\n\r\nThe report of Major Kelley and his recommendation for treatment were\r\nsubmitted to me and on October 20, 1945, I advised that “any treatment\r\nof this case involving the use of drugs which might cause injury to the\r\nsubject is disapproved.” This was not because I disapproved of the\r\ntreatment. I approve of the treatment and would insist on its being\r\nemployed if the victim were a member of my own family. But I was of the\r\nopinion that the private administration of any kind of drug to Hess\r\nwould be dangerous because if he should thereafter die, even of natural\r\ncauses, it would become the subject of public controversy. This\r\ncompletely agreed with the opinion of the Security Officer, Colonel B.\r\nC. Andrus, whose report is attached.\r\n\r\nIn view of the statements contained in the medical report of the\r\nCommission and in view of the facts which I have recited, the United\r\nStates must regard Hess as a victim, at most, of a voluntary amnesia and\r\npresenting no case for excuse from trial.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted\r\n\r\n                                          [signed]  Robert H. Jackson\r\n                                Chief of Counsel for the United States.\r\n 29 November 1945.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n [Enclosure]\r\n\r\n                              HEADQUARTERS\r\n                      INTERNAL SECURITY DETACHMENT\r\n                       OFFICE US CHIEF OF COUNSEL\r\n                            APO 403, US ARMY\r\n\r\n                                                        16 October 1945\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: Psychiatric Status of Internee.\r\nTO: Commanding Officer, Internal Security Detachment.\r\n\r\n1. Internee Rudolf HESS has been carefully studied since his admission\r\nto Nurnberg Prison.\r\n\r\n2. On entry HESS manifested a spotty amnesia. The British psychiatrist\r\naccompanying him stated that from 4 October 43 to 4 February 45 HESS\r\npresented symptoms of total amnesia. From 4 February 45 to 12 July 45 he\r\nrecovered, and is said to have made a statement that his previous\r\namnesia was simulated. On 12 July 45 he again developed amnesia which\r\nhas lasted to the present. Also while in England HESS claimed he was\r\nbeing poisoned and sealed up numerous samples of food, chocolate,\r\nmedicine, etc. as “evidence” to be analyzed prior to his trials. Such\r\nbehavior could be either simulated or a true paranoid reaction.\r\n\r\n3. Present examination reveals a normal mental status with the exception\r\nof the amnesia. Attitude and general behavior are normal, mood and\r\naffect, while slightly depressed, are intact and normal. Sensorium is\r\nintact and insight is good. Content reveals vague paranoid trends, but\r\nthere is no evidence of any actual psychosis. His reactions to his\r\nsuspicions are not fixed—and delusioned trends—are distinctly spotty\r\nand disconnected. His reactions are those of an individual who has given\r\nup a simulated behavior pattern rather than those of the psychotic.\r\nOddly enough his memory for this phase of behavior is excellent.\r\n\r\n4. Special examinations with Rorschach cards indicate some neurotic\r\npatterns. They point to a highly schizoid personality with hysterical\r\nand obsessive components. Such findings are confirmed in the patient’s\r\npresent reactions. He complains bitterly of “stomach cramps” which are\r\nobviously neurotic manifestations. He is over-dramatic in his actions\r\npresenting typical hysterical gestures, complaints and symptoms. His\r\namnesia is at present limited to personal events concerning his history\r\nafter joining the party. The amnesia however shifts in a highly\r\nsuspicious fashion. Such amnesias may be hysterical in nature but in\r\nsuch cases do not change in depth from day to day and facts recently\r\nlearned are not lost as with Hess.\r\n\r\n5. In HESS’ case there is also the factor of his long amnesia in\r\nEngland. It is quite possible that he has suggested an amnesia to\r\nhimself for so long that he partially believes in it. In a person of\r\nhysterical make-up such auto suggestion could readily produce an amnesic\r\nstate. Also the “gain” or protection found in amnesia, fancied or real,\r\nwould be a bar to its easy clearance. Finally a large conscious element\r\nmay well be present.\r\n\r\n6. In this case I believe all those factors are present. Treatment will\r\nhave to be formulated along lines attacking the suggestive factors and\r\novercoming conscious restraints. Hypnosis would be a value but probably\r\nchemical hypnosis will be required. Such narco-hypnosis and analysis\r\nrequire the use of intra venous drugs of the barbitol series, either\r\nsodium amytol or sodium pentothal. Such treatment is in general\r\ninnocuous if proper precautions are taken. It must be borne in mind,\r\nhowever, that occasional accidents happen in any intravenous technique.\r\nWith the drugs mentioned above rare fatalities have been reported\r\nalthough in more than 1000 such cases personally treated, I have never\r\nseen one.\r\n\r\n7. Essentially the present situation is as follows:\r\n\r\n_a._ Internee HESS is sane and responsible.\r\n\r\n_b._ Internee HESS is a profound neurotic of the hysterical type.\r\n\r\n_c._ His amnesia is of mixed etiology, stemming from auto suggestions\r\nand conscious malingering in a hysterical personality.\r\n\r\n_d._ Treatment will be required if it is felt desirable to remove this\r\namnesia.\r\n\r\n_e._ Such treatment, though it cannot eliminate the conscious element is\r\nof great value in estimating its importance. With such techniques\r\naccurate estimates of malingering can be made. If this is a true\r\namnesia, total recovery can be predicted.\r\n\r\n_f._ Such treatment is essentially harmless except in extremely rare\r\ninstances. In ordinary practice the value of the treatment far outweighs\r\nany of its hazards.\r\n\r\n8. Clarification as to the desired degree of treatment in this case is\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\n                                        [signed]  DOUGLAS McG.

What I\r\nhave to say is as follows: In order to prevent any possibility of my\r\nbeing declared incapable of pleading—although I am willing to take part\r\nin the rest of the proceedings with the rest of them, I would like to\r\nmake the following declaration to the Tribunal although I originally\r\nintended not to make this declaration until a later time. My memory is\r\nagain in order. The reason why I simulated loss of memory was tactical.\r\nIn fact, it is only that my power for concentration is slightly reduced\r\nbut in conflict to that my capacity to follow the trial, my capacity to\r\ndefend myself, to put questions to witnesses or even to answer\r\nquestions—in these, my capacities are not influenced. I emphasize the\r\nfact that I bear full responsibility for everything that I have done,\r\nsigned or have signed as co-signatory. My fundamental attitude that the\r\nTribunal is not legally competent, is not affected by the statement I\r\nhave just made. Hitherto, in my conversations with my official defense\r\ncounsel, I have maintained my loss of memory. He was, therefore, acting\r\nin good faith when he asserted I had lost my memory.”\r\n\r\n                      E. _RULING OF THE TRIBUNAL_\r\n\r\nThe ruling of the International Military Tribunal was announced orally\r\nby Lord Justice Lawrence, presiding, on 1 December 1945:\r\n\r\n“The Tribunal has given careful consideration to the motion of Counsel\r\nfor the Defendant Hess, and it has had the advantage of hearing full\r\nargument upon it both from the Defense and from the Prosecution. The\r\nTribunal has also considered the very full medical reports, which have\r\nbeen made on the condition of the Defendant Hess, and has come to the\r\nconclusion that no grounds whatever exist for a further examination to\r\nbe ordered.\r\n\r\n“After hearing the statement of the Defendant Hess in court yesterday,\r\nand in view of all the evidence, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the\r\nDefendant Hess is capable of standing his trial at the present time, and\r\nthe motion of Counsel for the Defense is, therefore, denied, and the\r\ntrial will proceed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter V\r\n                  OPENING ADDRESS FOR THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following address, opening the American case under Count I of the\r\nIndictment, was delivered by Justice Robert H. Jackson, Chief of Counsel\r\nfor the United States, before the Tribunal on 21 November 1945:_\r\n\r\nMay it please Your Honors,\r\n\r\nThe privilege of opening the first trial in history for crimes against\r\nthe peace of the world imposes a grave responsibility. The wrongs which\r\nwe seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant and\r\nso devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored\r\nbecause it cannot survive their being repeated. That four great nations,\r\nflushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance\r\nand voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law\r\nis one of the most significant tributes that Power ever has paid to\r\nReason.\r\n\r\nThis tribunal, while it is novel and experimental, is not the product of\r\nabstract speculations nor is it created to vindicate legalistic\r\ntheories. This inquest represents the practical effort of four of the\r\nmost mighty of nations, with the support of seventeen more, to utilize\r\nInternational Law to meet the greatest menace of our times—aggressive\r\nwar. The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with\r\nthe punishment of petty crimes by little people. It must also reach men\r\nwho possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted\r\nuse of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world\r\nuntouched. It is a cause of this magnitude that the United Nations will\r\nlay before Your Honors.\r\n\r\nIn the prisoners’ dock sit twenty-odd broken men. Reproached by the\r\nhumiliation of those they have led almost as bitterly as by the\r\ndesolation of those they have attacked, their personal capacity for evil\r\nis forever past. It is hard now to perceive in these miserable men as\r\ncaptives the power by which as Nazi leaders they once dominated much of\r\nthe world and terrified most of it. Merely as individuals, their fate is\r\nof little consequence to the world.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this inquest significant is that those prisoners represent\r\nsinister influence that will lurk in the world long after their bodies\r\nhave returned to dust. They are living symbols of racial hatreds, of\r\nterrorism and violence, and of the arrogance and cruelty of power. They\r\nare symbols of fierce nationalisms and militarism, of intrigue and\r\nwar-making which have embroiled Europe generation after generation,\r\ncrushing its manhood, destroying its homes, and impoverishing its life.\r\nThey have so identified themselves with the philosophies they conceived\r\nand with the forces they directed that any tenderness to them is a\r\nvictory and an encouragement to all the evils which are attached to\r\ntheir names. Civilization can afford no compromise with the social\r\nforces which would gain renewed strength if we deal ambiguously or\r\nindecisively with the men in whom those forces now precariously survive.\r\n\r\nWhat these men stand for we will patiently and temperately disclose. We\r\nwill give you undeniable proofs of incredible events. The catalogue of\r\ncrimes will omit nothing that could be conceived by a pathological\r\npride, cruelty, and lust for power. These men created in Germany, under\r\nthe _Fuehrerprinzip_, a National Socialist despotism equalled only by\r\nthe dynasties of the ancient East. They took from the German people all\r\nthose dignities and freedoms that we hold natural and inalienable rights\r\nin every human being. The people were compensated by inflaming and\r\ngratifying hatreds toward those who were marked as “scape-goats.”\r\nAgainst their opponents, including Jews, Catholics, and free labor the\r\nNazis directed such a campaign of arrogance, brutality, and annihilation\r\nas the world has not witnessed since the pre-Christian ages. They\r\nexcited the German ambition to be a “master race,” which of course\r\nimplies serfdom for others. They led their people on a mad gamble for\r\ndomination. They diverted social energies and resources to the creation\r\nof what they thought to be an invincible war machine. They overran their\r\nneighbors. To sustain the “master race” in its war-making, they enslaved\r\nmillions of human beings and brought them into Germany, where these\r\nhapless creatures now wander as “displaced persons”. At length\r\nbestiality and bad faith reached such excess that they aroused the\r\nsleeping strength of imperiled civilization. Its united efforts have\r\nground the German war machine to fragments. But the struggle has left\r\nEurope a liberated yet prostrate land where a demoralized society\r\nstruggles to survive. These are the fruits of the sinister forces that\r\nsit with these defendants in the prisoners’ dock.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the nations and the men associated in this prosecution, I\r\nmust remind you of certain difficulties which may leave their mark on\r\nthis case. Never before in legal history has an effort been made to\r\nbring within the scope of a single litigation the developments of a\r\ndecade, covering a whole Continent, and involving a score of nations,\r\ncountless individuals, and innumerable events. Despite the magnitude of\r\nthe task, the world has demanded immediate action. This demand has had\r\nto be met, though perhaps at the cost of finished craftsmanship. In my\r\ncountry, established courts, following familiar procedures, applying\r\nwell thumbed precedents, and dealing with the legal consequences of\r\nlocal and limited events seldom commence a trial within a year of the\r\nevent in litigation. Yet less than eight months ago today the courtroom\r\nin which you sit was an enemy fortress in the hands of German SS troops.\r\nLess than eight months ago nearly all our witnesses and documents were\r\nin enemy hands. The law had not been codified, no procedure had been\r\nestablished, no Tribunal was in existence, no usable courthouse stood\r\nhere, none of the hundreds of tons of official German documents had been\r\nexamined, no prosecuting staff had been assembled, nearly all the\r\npresent defendants were at large, and the four prosecuting powers had\r\nnot yet joined in common cause to try them. I should be the last to deny\r\nthat the case may well suffer from incomplete researches and quite\r\nlikely will not be the example of professional work which any of the\r\nprosecuting nations would normally wish to sponsor. It is, however, a\r\ncompletely adequate case to the judgment we shall ask you to render, and\r\nits full development we shall be obliged to leave to historians.\r\n\r\nBefore I discuss particulars of evidence, some general considerations\r\nwhich may affect the credit of this trial in the eyes of the world\r\nshould be candidly faced. There is a dramatic disparity between the\r\ncircumstances of the accusers and of the accused that might discredit\r\nour work if we should falter, in even minor matters, in being fair and\r\ntemperate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the nature of these crimes is such that both prosecution\r\nand judgment must be by victor nations over vanquished foes. The\r\nworldwide scope of the aggressions carried out by these men has left but\r\nfew real neutrals. Either the victors must judge the vanquished or we\r\nmust leave the defeated to judge themselves. After the First World War,\r\nwe learned the futility of the latter course. The former high station of\r\nthese defendants, the notoriety of their acts, and the adaptability of\r\ntheir conduct to provoke retaliation make it hard to distinguish between\r\nthe demand for a just and measured retribution, and the unthinking cry\r\nfor vengeance which arises from the anguish of war. It is our task, so\r\nfar as humanly possible, to draw the line between the two. We must never\r\nforget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the\r\nrecord on which history will judge us tomorrow. To pass these defendants\r\na poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well. We must summon\r\nsuch detachment and intellectual integrity to our task that this trial\r\nwill commend itself to posterity as fulfilling humanity’s aspirations to\r\ndo justice.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, let us dispose of the contention that to put these\r\nmen to trial is to do them an injustice entitling them to some special\r\nconsideration. These defendants may be hard pressed but they are not ill\r\nused. Let us see what alternative they would have to being tried.\r\n\r\nMore than a majority of these prisoners surrendered to or were tracked\r\ndown by forces of the United States. Could they expect us to make\r\nAmerican custody a shelter for our enemies against the just wrath of our\r\nAllies? Did we spend American lives to capture them only to save them\r\nfrom punishment? Under the principles of the Moscow Declaration, those\r\nsuspected war criminals who are not to be tried internationally must be\r\nturned over to individual governments for trial at the scene of their\r\noutrages. Many less responsible and less culpable American-held\r\nprisoners have been and will be turned over to other United Nations for\r\nlocal trial. If these defendants should succeed, for any reason, in\r\nescaping the condemnation of this Tribunal, or if they obstruct or abort\r\nthis trial, those who are American-held prisoners will be delivered up\r\nto our continental Allies. For these defendants, however, we have set up\r\nan International Tribunal and have undertaken the burden of\r\nparticipating in a complicated effort to give them fair and\r\ndispassionate hearings. That is the best known protection to any man\r\nwith a defense worthy of being heard.\r\n\r\nIf these men are the first war leaders of a defeated nation to be\r\nprosecuted in the name of the law, they are also the first to be given a\r\nchance to plead for their lives in the name of the law. Realistically,\r\nthe Charter of this Tribunal, which gives them a hearing, is also the\r\nsource of their only hope. It may be that these men of troubled\r\nconscience, whose only wish is that the world forget them, do not regard\r\na trial as a favor. But they do have a fair opportunity to defend\r\nthemselves—a favor which these men, when in power, rarely extended to\r\ntheir fellow countrymen. Despite the fact that public opinion already\r\ncondemns their acts, we agree that here they must be given a presumption\r\nof innocence, and we accept the burden of proving criminal acts and the\r\nresponsibility of these defendants for their commission.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that we do not ask for convictions unless we prove crime, I\r\ndo not mean mere technical or incidental transgression of international\r\nconventions. We charge guilt on planned and intended conduct that\r\ninvolves moral as well as legal wrong. And we do not mean conduct that\r\nis a natural and human, even if illegal, cutting of corners, such as\r\nmany of us might well have committed had we been in the defendants’\r\npositions. It is not because they yielded to the normal frailties of\r\nhuman beings that we accuse them. It is their abnormal and inhuman\r\nconduct which brings them to this bar.\r\n\r\nWe will not ask you to convict these men on the testimony of their foes.\r\nThere is no count of the Indictment that cannot be proved by books and\r\nrecords. The Germans were always meticulous record keepers, and these\r\ndefendants had their share of the Teutonic passion for thoroughness in\r\nputting things on paper. Nor were they without vanity. They arranged\r\nfrequently to be photographed in action. We will show you their own\r\nfilms. You will see their own conduct and hear their own voices as these\r\ndefendants reenact for you, from the screen, some of the events in the\r\ncourse of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nWe would also make clear that we have no purpose to incriminate the\r\nwhole German people. We know that the Nazi Party was not put in power by\r\na majority of the German vote. We know it came to power by an evil\r\nalliance between the most extreme of the Nazi revolutionists, the most\r\nunrestrained of the German reactionaries, and the most aggressive of the\r\nGerman militarists. If the German populace had willingly accepted the\r\nNazi program, no Stormtroopers would have been needed in the early days\r\nof the Party and there would have been no need for concentration camps\r\nor the Gestapo, both of which institutions were inaugurated as soon as\r\nthe Nazis gained control of the German state. Only after these lawless\r\ninnovations proved successful at home were they taken abroad.\r\n\r\nThe German people should know by now that the people of the United\r\nStates hold them in no fear, and in no hate. It is true that the Germans\r\nhave taught us the horrors of modern warfare, but the ruin that lies\r\nfrom the Rhine to the Danube shows that we, like our Allies, have not\r\nbeen dull pupils. If we are not awed by German fortitude and proficiency\r\nin war, and if we are not persuaded of their political maturity, we do\r\nrespect their skill in the arts of peace, their technical competence,\r\nand the sober, industrious and self-disciplined character of the masses\r\nof the German people. In 1933, we saw the German people recovering\r\nprestige in the commercial, industrial and artistic world after the\r\nset-back of the last war. We beheld their progress neither with envy nor\r\nmalice. The Nazi regime interrupted this advance. The recoil of the Nazi\r\naggression has left Germany in ruins. The Nazi readiness to pledge the\r\nGerman word without hesitation and to break it without shame has\r\nfastened upon German diplomacy a reputation for duplicity that will\r\nhandicap it for years. Nazi arrogance has made the boast of the “master\r\nrace” a taunt that will be thrown at Germans the world over for\r\ngenerations. The Nazi nightmare has given the German name a new and\r\nsinister significance throughout the world which will retard Germany a\r\ncentury. The German, no less than the non-German world, has accounts to\r\nsettle with these defendants.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the war and the course of the war, which is the central\r\ntheme of our case, is history. From September 1st, 1939, when the German\r\narmies crossed the Polish frontiers, until September, 1942, when they\r\nmet epic resistance at Stalingrad, German arms seemed invincible.\r\nDenmark and Norway, The Netherlands and France, Belgium and Luxembourg,\r\nthe Balkans and Africa, Poland and the Baltic States, and parts of\r\nRussia, all had been overrun and conquered by swift, powerful,\r\nwell-aimed blows. That attack upon the peace of the world is the crime\r\nagainst international society which brings into international cognizance\r\ncrimes in its aid and preparation which otherwise might be only internal\r\nconcerns. It was aggressive war, which the nations of the world had\r\nrenounced. It was war in violation of treaties, by which the peace of\r\nthe world was sought to be safeguarded.\r\n\r\nThis war did not just happen—it was planned and prepared for over a\r\nlong period of time and with no small skill and cunning. The world has\r\nperhaps never seen such a concentration and stimulation of the energies\r\nof any people as that which enabled Germany twenty years after it was\r\ndefeated, disarmed, and dismembered to come so near carrying out its\r\nplan to dominate Europe. Whatever else we may say of those who were the\r\nauthors of this war, they did achieve a stupendous work in organization,\r\nand our first task is to examine the means by which these defendants and\r\ntheir fellow conspirators prepared and incited Germany to go to war.\r\n\r\nIn general, our case will disclose these defendants all uniting at some\r\ntime with the Nazi Party in a plan which they well knew could be\r\naccomplished only by an outbreak of war in Europe. Their seizure of the\r\nGerman state, their subjugation of the German people, their terrorism\r\nand extermination of dissident elements, their planning and waging of\r\nwar, their calculated and planned ruthlessness in the conduct of\r\nwarfare, their deliberate and planned criminality toward conquered\r\npeoples, all these are ends for which they acted in concert; and all\r\nthese are phases of the conspiracy, a conspiracy which reached one goal\r\nonly to set out for another and more ambitious one. We shall also trace\r\nfor you the intricate web of organizations which these men formed and\r\nutilized to accomplish these ends. We will show how the entire structure\r\nof offices and officials was dedicated to the criminal purposes and\r\ncommitted to use of the criminal methods planned by these defendants and\r\ntheir co-conspirators, many of whom war and suicide have put beyond\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to open the case, particularly under Count One of the\r\nIndictment, and to deal with the common plan or conspiracy to achieve\r\nends possible only by resort to crimes against peace, war crimes, and\r\ncrimes against humanity. My emphasis will not be on individual\r\nbarbarities and perversions which may have occurred independently of any\r\ncentral plan. One of the dangers ever-present is that this trial may be\r\nprotracted by details of particular wrongs and that we will become lost\r\nin a “wilderness of single instances.” Nor will I now dwell on the\r\nactivity of individual defendants except as it may contribute to\r\nexposition of the common plan.\r\n\r\nThe case as presented by the United States will be concerned with the\r\nbrains and authority back of all the crimes. These defendants were men\r\nof a station and rank which does not soil its own hands with blood. They\r\nwere men who knew how to use lesser folk as tools. We want to reach the\r\nplanners and designers, the inciters and leaders without whose evil\r\narchitecture the world would not have been for so long scourged with the\r\nviolence and lawlessness, and wracked with the agonies and convulsions,\r\nof this terrible war.\r\n\r\n                       THE LAWLESS ROAD TO POWER\r\n\r\nThe chief instrumentality of cohesion in plan and action was the\r\nNational Socialist German Workers Party, known as the Nazi Party. Some\r\nof the defendants were with it from the beginning. Others joined only\r\nafter success seemed to have validated its lawlessness or power had\r\ninvested it with immunity from the processes of the law. Adolf Hitler\r\nbecame its supreme leader or _fuehrer_ in 1921.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1920, at Munich, it publicly had proclaimed its\r\nprogram (_1708-PS_). Some of its purposes would commend themselves to\r\nmany good citizens, such as the demands for “profit-sharing in the great\r\nindustries,” “generous development of provision for old age,” “creation\r\nand maintenance of a healthy middle class,” “a land reform suitable to\r\nour national requirements,” and “raising the standard of health.” It\r\nalso made a strong appeal to that sort of nationalism which in ourselves\r\nwe call patriotism and in our rivals chauvinism. It demanded “equality\r\nof rights for the German people in its dealing with other nations and\r\nthe evolution of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germaine.” It\r\ndemanded the “union of all Germans on the basis of the right of\r\nself-determination of peoples to form a Great Germany.” It demanded\r\n“land and territory (colonies) for the enrichment of our people and the\r\nsettlement of our surplus population.” All these, of course, were\r\nlegitimate objectives if they were to be attained without resort to\r\naggressive warfare.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party from its inception, however, contemplated war. It\r\ndemanded “the abolition of mercenary troops and the formation of a\r\nnational army.” It proclaimed that “In view of the enormous sacrifice of\r\nlife and property demanded of a nation by every war, personal enrichment\r\nthrough war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. We demand,\r\ntherefore, the ruthless confiscation of all war profits.” I do not\r\ncriticise this policy. Indeed, I wish it were universal. I merely point\r\nout that in a time of peace, war was a preoccupation of the Party, and\r\nit started the work of making war less offensive to the masses of the\r\npeople. With this it combined a program of physical training and sports\r\nfor youth that became, as we shall see, the cloak for a secret program\r\nof military training.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party declaration also committed its members to an anti-Semitic\r\nprogram. It declared that no Jew or any person of non-German blood could\r\nbe a member of the nation. Such persons were to be disfranchised,\r\ndisqualified for office, subject to the alien laws, and entitled to\r\nnourishment only after the German population had first been provided\r\nfor. All who had entered Germany after August 2, 1914 were to be\r\nrequired forthwith to depart, and all non-German immigration was to be\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nThe Party also avowed, even in those early days, an authoritarian and\r\ntotalitarian program for Germany. It demanded creation of a strong\r\ncentral power with unconditional authority, nationalization of all\r\nbusinesses which had been “amalgamated,” and a “reconstruction” of the\r\nnational system of education which “must aim at teaching the pupil to\r\nunderstand the idea of the State (state sociology).” Its hostility to\r\ncivil liberties and freedom of the press was distinctly announced in\r\nthese words: “It must be forbidden to publish newspapers which do not\r\nconduce to the national welfare. We demand the legal prosecution of all\r\ntendencies in art or literature of a kind likely to disintegrate our\r\nlife as a nation and the suppression of institutions which might\r\nmilitate against the above requirements.”\r\n\r\nThe forecast of religious persecution was clothed in the language of\r\nreligious liberty, for the Nazi program stated, “We demand liberty for\r\nall religious denominations in the State.” But, it continues with the\r\nlimitation, “so far as they are not a danger to it and do not militate\r\nagainst the morality and moral sense of the German race.”\r\n\r\nThe Party program foreshadowed the campaign of terrorism. It announced,\r\n“We demand ruthless war upon those whose activities are injurious to the\r\ncommon interests”, and it demanded that such offenses be punished with\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the leaders of this Party interpreted this\r\nprogram as a belligerent one certain to precipitate conflict. The Party\r\nplatform concluded, “The leaders of the Party swear to proceed\r\nregardless of consequences—if necessary, at the sacrifice of their\r\nlives—toward the fulfillment of the foregoing points.” It is this\r\nLeadership Corps of the Party, not its entire membership, that stands\r\naccused as a criminal organization.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how the leaders of the Party fulfilled their pledge to\r\nproceed regardless of consequences. Obviously, their foreign objectives,\r\nwhich were nothing less than to undo international treaties and to wrest\r\nterritory from foreign control, as well as most of their internal\r\nprogram, could be accomplished only by possession of the machinery of\r\nthe German State. The first effort, accordingly, was to subvert the\r\nWeimar Republic by violent revolution. An abortive putsch at Munich in\r\n1923 landed many of them in jail. The period of meditation which\r\nfollowed produced _Mein Kampf_, henceforth the source of law for the\r\nParty workers and a source of considerable revenue to its supreme\r\nleader. The Nazi plans for the violent overthrow of the feeble Republic\r\nthen turned to plans for its capture.\r\n\r\nNo greater mistake could be made than to think of the Nazi Party in\r\nterms of the loose organizations which we of the western world call\r\n“political parties.” In discipline, structure, and method the Nazi Party\r\nwas not adapted to the democratic process of persuasion. It was an\r\ninstrument of conspiracy and of coercion. The Party was not organized to\r\ntake over power in the German State by winning support of a majority of\r\nthe German people. It was organized to seize power in defiance of the\r\nwill of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party, under the _Fuehrerprinzip_, was bound by an iron\r\ndiscipline into a pyramid, with the Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler, at the top\r\nand broadening into a numerous Leadership Corps, composed of overlords\r\nof a very extensive Party membership at the base. By no means all of\r\nthose who may have supported the movement in one way or another were\r\nactual Party members. The membership took the Party oath which in\r\neffect, amounted to an abdication of personal intelligence and moral\r\nresponsibility. This was the oath: “I vow inviolable fidelity to Adolf\r\nHitler; I vow absolute obedience to him and to the leaders he designates\r\nfor me.” The membership in daily practice followed its leaders with an\r\nidolatry and self-surrender more Oriental than Western.\r\n\r\nWe will not be obliged to guess as to the motives or goal of the Nazi\r\nParty. The immediate aim was to undermine the Weimar Republic. The order\r\nto all Party members to work to that end was given in a letter from\r\nHitler of August 24, 1931 to Rosenberg, of which we will produce the\r\noriginal. Hitler wrote,\r\n\r\n    “I am just reading in the VOELKISCHER BEOBACHTER, edition\r\n    235/236, page 1, an article entitled “Does Wirth intend to come\r\n    over?” The tendency of the article is to prevent on our part a\r\n    crumbling away from the present form of government. I myself am\r\n    travelling all over Germany to achieve exactly the opposite. May\r\n    I therefore ask that my own paper will not stab me in the back\r\n    with tactically unwise articles * * *” (_047-PS_).\r\n\r\nCaptured film enables us to present the defendant, Alfred Rosenberg, who\r\nfrom the screen will himself tell you the story. The SA practiced\r\nviolent interference with elections. We have the reports of the SD\r\ndescribing in detail how its members later violated the secrecy of\r\nelections in order to identify those who opposed them. One of the\r\nreports makes this explanation:\r\n\r\n    “The control was effected in the following way: some members of\r\n    the election-committee marked all the ballot papers with\r\n    numbers. During the ballot itself, a voters’ list was made up.\r\n    The ballot-papers were handed out in numerical order, therefore\r\n    it was possible afterwards with the aid of this list to find out\r\n    the persons who cast no-votes or invalid votes. One sample of\r\n    these marked ballot-papers is enclosed. The marking was done on\r\n    the back of the ballot-papers with skimmed milk * * *”\r\n    (_R-142_).\r\n\r\nThe Party activity, in addition to all the familiar forms of political\r\ncontest, took on the aspect of a rehearsal for warfare. It utilized a\r\nParty formation, _DIE STURMABTEILUNGEN_, commonly known as the SA. This\r\nwas a voluntary organization of youthful and fanatical Nazis trained for\r\nthe use of violence under semi-military discipline. Its members began by\r\nacting as bodyguards for the Nazi leaders and rapidly expanded from\r\ndefensive to offensive tactics. They became disciplined ruffians for the\r\nbreaking up of opposition meetings and the terrorization of adversaries.\r\nThey boasted that their task was to make the Nazi Party “master of the\r\nstreets.” The SA was the parent organization of a number of others. Its\r\noffspring include _DIE SCHUTZSTAFFELN_, commonly known as the SS, formed\r\nin 1925 and distinguished for the fanaticism and cruelty of its members;\r\n_DER SICHERHEITSDIENST_, known as the SD; and _DIE GEHEIME\r\nSTAATSPOLIZEI_, the Secret State Police, the infamous Gestapo formed in\r\n1934 after Nazi accession to power.\r\n\r\nA glance at a chart of the Party organization (_Chart No. 1_) is enough\r\nto show how completely it differed from the political parties we know.\r\nIt had its own source of law in the fuehrer and sub-fuehrers. It had its\r\nown courts and its own police. The conspirators set up a government\r\nwithin the Party to exercise outside the law every sanction that any\r\nlegitimate state could exercise and many that it could not. Its chain of\r\ncommand was military, and its formations were martial in name as well as\r\nin function. They were composed of battalions set up to bear arms under\r\nmilitary discipline, motorized corps, flying corps, and the infamous\r\n“Death Head Corps”, which was not misnamed. The Party had its own secret\r\npolice, its security units, its intelligence and espionage division, its\r\nraiding forces, and its youth forces. It established elaborate\r\nadministrative mechanisms to identify and liquidate spies and informers,\r\nto manage concentration camps, to operate death vans, and to finance the\r\nwhole movement. Through concentric circles of authority, the Nazi Party,\r\nas its leadership later boasted, eventually organized and dominated\r\nevery phase of German life—but not until they had waged a bitter\r\ninternal struggle characterized by brutal criminality. In preparation\r\nfor this phase of their struggle, they created a party police system.\r\nThis became the pattern and the instrument of the police state, which\r\nwas the first goal in their plan.\r\n\r\nThe Party formations, including the Leadership Corps of the Party, the\r\nSD, the SS, the SA and the infamous Secret State Police, or Gestapo—all\r\nthese stand accused before you as criminal organizations; organizations\r\nwhich, as we will prove from their own documents, were recruited only\r\nfrom recklessly devoted Nazis, ready in conviction and temperament to do\r\nthe most violent of deeds to advance the common program. They terrorized\r\nand silenced democratic opposition and were able at length to combine\r\nwith political opportunists, militarists, industrialists, monarchists,\r\nand political reactionaries.\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1933 Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the German\r\nRepublic. An evil combination, represented in the prisoners’ dock, by\r\nits most eminent survivors, had succeeded in possessing itself of the\r\nmachinery of the German Government, a facade behind which they\r\nthenceforth would operate to make a reality of the war of conquest they\r\nso long had plotted. The conspiracy had passed into its second phase.\r\n\r\n                    THE CONSOLIDATION OF NAZI POWER\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the steps, which embraced the most hideous of\r\ncrimes against humanity, to which the conspirators resorted in\r\nperfecting control of the German State and in preparing Germany for the\r\naggressive war indispensable to their ends.\r\n\r\nThe Germans of the 1920’s were a frustrated and baffled people as a\r\nresult of defeat and the disintegration of their traditional government.\r\nThe democratic elements, which were trying to govern Germany through the\r\nnew and feeble machinery of the Weimar Republic, got inadequate support\r\nfrom the democratic forces of the rest of the world. It is not to be\r\ndenied that Germany, when worldwide depression was added to her other\r\nproblems, was faced with urgent and intricate pressure in her economic\r\nand political life which necessitated bold measures.\r\n\r\nThe internal measures by which a nation attempts to solve its problems\r\nare ordinarily of no concern to other nations. But the Nazi program from\r\nthe first was recognized as a desperate program for a people still\r\nsuffering the effects of an unsuccessful war. The Nazi policy embraced\r\nends always recognized as attainable only by a renewal and a more\r\nsuccessful outcome of war. The conspirators’ answer to Germany’s\r\nproblems was nothing less than to plot the regaining of territories lost\r\nin the First World War and the acquisition of other fertile lands of\r\nCentral Europe by dispossessing or exterminating those who inhabited\r\nthem. They also contemplated destroying or permanently weakening all\r\nother neighboring peoples so as to win virtual domination of Europe and\r\nprobably of the world. The precise limits of their ambition we need not\r\ndefine for it was and is as illegal to wage aggressive war for small\r\nstakes as for large ones.\r\n\r\nWe find at this period two governments in Germany—the real and the\r\nostensible. The forms of the German Republic were maintained for a time,\r\nand it was the outward and visible government. But the real authority in\r\nthe State was outside of and above the law and rested in the Leadership\r\nCorps of the Nazi Party.\r\n\r\nOn February 27, 1933, less than a month after Hitler became Chancellor,\r\nthe Reichstag building was set on fire. The burning of this symbol of\r\nfree parliamentary government was so providential for the Nazis that it\r\nwas believed they staged the fire themselves. Certainly when we\r\ncontemplate their known crimes, we cannot believe they would shrink from\r\nmere arson. It is not necessary, however, to resolve the controversy as\r\nto who set the fire. The significant point is in the use that was made\r\nof the fire and of the state of public mind it produced. The Nazis\r\nimmediately accused the Communist Party of instigating and committing\r\nthe crime, and turned every effort to portray this single act of arson\r\nas the beginning of a Communist revolution. Then, taking advantage of\r\nthe hysteria, the Nazi met this phantom revolution with a real one. In\r\nthe following December, the German Supreme Court with commendable\r\ncourage and independence acquitted the accused Communists, but it was\r\ntoo late to influence the tragic course of events which the Nazi\r\nconspirators had set rushing forward.\r\n\r\nHitler, on the morning after the fire, obtained from the aged and ailing\r\nPresident von Hindenburg a Presidential decree suspending the extensive\r\nguarantees of individual liberty contained in the Constitution of the\r\nWeimar Republic. The decree provided that:\r\n\r\n    “Sections 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124 and 153 of the\r\n    Constitution of the German Reich are suspended until further\r\n    notice. Thus, restrictions on personal liberty, on the right of\r\n    free expression of opinion, including freedom of the press, on\r\n    the right of assembly and the right of association, and\r\n    violations of the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic\r\n    communications, and warrants for house-searches, orders for\r\n    confiscations as well as restrictions on property, are also\r\n    permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed.”\r\n    (_1390-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe extent of the restriction on personal liberty under the decree of\r\nFebruary 28, 1933 may be understood by reference to the rights under the\r\nWeimar Constitution which were suspended:\r\n\r\n    “_Article 114._ The freedom of the person is inviolable.\r\n    Curtailment or deprivation of personal freedom by a public\r\n    authority is only permissible on a legal basis.\r\n\r\n    “Persons who have been deprived of their freedom must be\r\n    informed at the latest on the following day by whose authority\r\n    and for what reasons the deprivation of freedom was ordered;\r\n    opportunity shall be afforded them without delay of submitting\r\n    objections to their deprivation of freedom.\r\n\r\n    “_Article 115._ Every German’s home is his sanctuary and\r\n    inviolable. Exceptions may only be made as provided by law.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Article 117._ The secrecy of letters and all postal,\r\n    telegraphic and telephone communications is inviolable.\r\n    Exceptions are inadmissible except by Reich law.\r\n\r\n    “_Article 118._ Every German has the right, within the limits of\r\n    the general laws, to express his opinions freely in speech, in\r\n    writing, in print, in picture form or in any other way. No\r\n    conditions of work or employment may detract from this right and\r\n    no disadvantage may accrue to him from any person for making use\r\n    of this right. * * *\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Article 123._ All Germans have the right to assemble\r\n    peacefully and unarmed without giving notice and without special\r\n    permission.\r\n\r\n    “A Reich law may make previous notification obligatory for\r\n    assemblies in the open air, and may prohibit them in the case of\r\n    immediate danger to the public safety.\r\n\r\n    “_Article 124._ All the Germans have the right to form\r\n    associations or societies for purposes not contrary to criminal\r\n    law. This right may not be curtailed by preventive measures. The\r\n    same provisions apply to religious associations and societies.\r\n\r\n    “Every association may become incorporated (Erwerb der\r\n    Rechtsfaehigkeit) according to the provisions of the civil law.\r\n    The right may not be refused to any association on the grounds\r\n    that its aims are political, social-political or religious.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Article 153._ Property is guaranteed by the Constitution. Its\r\n    content and limits are defined by the laws.\r\n\r\n    “Expropriation can only take place for the public benefit and on\r\n    a legal basis. Adequate compensation shall be granted, unless a\r\n    Reich law orders otherwise. In the case of dispute concerning\r\n    the amount of compensation, it shall be possible to submit the\r\n    matter to the ordinary civil courts, unless Reich laws determine\r\n    otherwise. Compensation must be paid if the Reich expropriates\r\n    property belonging to the Lands, Communes, or public utility\r\n    associations.\r\n\r\n    “Property carries obligations. Its use shall also serve the\r\n    common good.” (_2050-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt must be said in fairness to von Hindenburg that the Constitution\r\nitself authorized him temporarily to suspend these fundamental rights\r\n“if the public safety and order in the German Reich are considerably\r\ndisturbed or endangered.” It must also be acknowledged that President\r\nEbert previously had invoked this power.\r\n\r\nBut the National Socialist coup was made possible because the terms of\r\nthe Hitler-Hindenburg decree departed from all previous ones in which\r\nthe power of suspension had been invoked. Whenever Ebert had suspended\r\nconstitutional guarantees of individual rights, his decree had expressly\r\nrevived the Protective Custody Act adopted by the Reichstag in 1916\r\nduring the previous war. This Act guaranteed a judicial hearing within\r\n24 hours of arrest, gave a right to have counsel and to inspect all\r\nrelevant records, provided for appeal, and authorized compensation from\r\nTreasury funds for erroneous arrests.\r\n\r\nThe Hitler-Hindenburg decree of February 28, 1933 contained no such\r\nsafeguards. The omission may not have been noted by von Hindenburg.\r\nCertainly he did not appreciate its effect. It left the Nazi police and\r\nparty formations, already existing and functioning under Hitler,\r\ncompletely unrestrained and irresponsible. Secret arrest and indefinite\r\ndetention, without charges, without evidence, without hearing, without\r\ncounsel, became the method of inflicting inhuman punishment on any whom\r\nthe Nazi police suspected or disliked. No court could issue an\r\ninjunction, or writ of _habeas corpus_, or _certiorari_. The German\r\npeople were in the hands of the police, the police were in the hands of\r\nthe Nazi Party, and the Party was in the hands of a ring of evil men, of\r\nwhom the defendants here before you are surviving and representative\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspiracy, as we shall show, always contemplated not merely\r\novercoming current opposition but exterminating elements which could not\r\nbe reconciled with its philosophy of the state. It not only sought to\r\nestablish the Nazi “new order” but to secure its sway, as Hitler\r\npredicted, “for a thousand years.” Nazis were never in doubt or\r\ndisagreement as to what these dissident elements were. They were\r\nconcisely described by one of them, Col. General von Fritsch, on\r\nDecember 11, 1938, in these words:\r\n\r\n    “Shortly after the first war I came to the conclusion that we\r\n    should have to be victorious in three battles if Germany were to\r\n    become powerful again: 1. The battle against the working\r\n    class—Hitler has won this. 2. Against the Catholic Church,\r\n    perhaps better expressed against Ultramontanism. 3. Against the\r\n    Jews.” (_1947-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe warfare against these elements was continuous. The battle in Germany\r\nwas but a practice skirmish for the worldwide drive against them. We\r\nhave in point of geography and of time two groups of crimes against\r\nhumanity—one within Germany before and during the war, the other in\r\noccupied territory during the war. But the two are not separated in Nazi\r\nplanning. They are a continuous unfolding of the Nazi plan to\r\nexterminate peoples and institutions which might serve as a focus or\r\ninstrument for overturning their “new world order” at any time. We\r\nconsider these Crimes against Humanity in this address as manifestations\r\nof the one Nazi plan and discuss them according to General von Fritsch’s\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n                1. The Battle Against the Working Class\r\n\r\nWhen Hitler came to power, there were in Germany three groups of trade\r\nunions. The General German Trade Union Confederation (ADGB) with\r\ntwenty-eight affiliated unions, and the General Independent Employees\r\nConfederation (AFA) with thirteen federated unions together numbered\r\nmore than 4,500,000 members. The Christian Trade Union had over\r\n1,250,000 members.\r\n\r\nThe working people of Germany, like the working people of other nations,\r\nhad little to gain personally by war. While labor is usually brought\r\naround to the support of the nation at war, labor by and large is a\r\npacific, though by no means a pacifist force in the world. The working\r\npeople of Germany had not forgotten in 1933 how heavy the yoke of the\r\nwar lord can be. It was the workingmen who had joined the sailors and\r\nsoldiers in the revolt of 1918 to end the First World War. The Nazis had\r\nneither forgiven nor forgotten. The Nazi program required that this part\r\nof the German population not only be stripped of power to resist\r\ndiversion of its scanty comforts to armament, but also be wheedled or\r\nwhipped into new and unheard of sacrifices as part of the Nazi war\r\npreparation. Labor must be cowed, and that meant its organizations and\r\nmeans of cohesion and defense must be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe purpose to regiment labor for the Nazi Party was avowed by Ley in a\r\nspeech to workers on May 2, 1933, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “You may say what else do you want, you have the absolute power.\r\n    True we have the power, but we do not have the whole people, we\r\n    do not have you workers 100%, and it is you whom we want; we\r\n    will not let you be until you stand with us in complete, genuine\r\n    acknowledgment.” (_614-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe first Nazi attack was upon the two larger unions. On April 21, 1933\r\nan order not even in the name of the Government, but of the Nazi Party\r\nwas issued by the conspirator Robert Ley as “Chief of Staff of the\r\npolitical organization of the NSDAP,” applicable to the Trade Union\r\nConfederation and the Independent Employees Confederation. It directed\r\nseizure of their properties and arrest of their principal leaders. The\r\nparty order directed party organs which we here denounce as criminal\r\nassociations, the SA and SS “to be employed for the occupation of the\r\ntrade union properties, and for the taking into custody of personalities\r\nwho come into question.” And it directed the taking into “protective\r\ncustody” of all chairmen and district secretaries of such unions and\r\nbranch directors of the labor bank (_392-PS_).\r\n\r\nThese orders were carried out on May 2, 1933. All funds of the labor\r\nunions, including pension and benefit funds, were seized. Union leaders\r\nwere sent to concentration camps. A few days later, on May 10, 1933,\r\nHitler appointed Ley leader of the German Labor Front (_DEUTSCHE\r\nARBEITSFRONT_), which succeeded to the confiscated union funds. The\r\nGerman Labor Front, a Nazi controlled labor bureau, was set up under Ley\r\nto teach the Nazi philosophy to German workers and to weed out from\r\nindustrial employment all who were backward in their lessons\r\n(_1940-PS_). “Factory Troops” were organized as an “ideological shock\r\nsquad within the factory” (_1817-PS_). The Party order provided that\r\n“outside of the German Labor Front, no other organization (whether of\r\nworkers or of employees) is to exist.” On June 24, 1933 the remaining\r\nChristian Trade Unions were seized pursuant to an order of the Nazi\r\nParty signed by Ley.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, 1933, this time by government decree, it was provided that\r\n“trustees” of labor, appointed by Hitler, should regulate the conditions\r\nof all labor contracts, replacing the former process of collective\r\nbargaining (_405-PS_). On January 20, 1934 a decree “regulating national\r\nlabor” introduced the fuehrer-principle into industrial relations. It\r\nprovided that the owners of enterprises should be the “fuehrers” and the\r\nworkers should be the followers. The enterpriser-fuehrers should “make\r\ndecisions for employees and laborers in all matters concerning the\r\nenterprise” (_1861-PS_). It was by such bait that the great German\r\nindustrialists were induced to support the Nazi cause, to their own\r\nultimate ruin.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Nazis dominate and regiment German labor, but they\r\nforced the youth into the ranks of the laboring people they had thus led\r\ninto chains. Under a compulsory labor service decree on 26 June, 1935,\r\nyoung men and women between the ages of 18 and 25 were conscripted for\r\nlabor (see _1654-PS_). Thus was the purpose to subjugate German labor\r\naccomplished. In the words of Ley, this accomplishment consisted “in\r\neliminating the association character of the trade union and employees’\r\nassociations, and in its place we have substituted the conception\r\n‘soldiers of work’.” The productive manpower of the German nation was in\r\nNazi control. By these steps the defendants won the battle to liquidate\r\nlabor unions as potential opposition and were enabled to impose upon the\r\nworking class the burdens of preparing for aggressive warfare.\r\n\r\nRobert Ley, the field marshal of the battle against labor, answered our\r\nindictment with suicide. Apparently he knew no better answer.\r\n\r\n                   2. The Battle Against the Churches\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party always was predominantly anti-Christian in its ideology.\r\nBut we who believe in freedom of conscience and of religion base no\r\ncharge of criminality on anybody’s ideology. It is not because the Nazi\r\nthemselves were irreligious or pagan, but because they persecuted others\r\nof the Christian faith that they become guilty of crime, and it is\r\nbecause the persecution was a step in the preparation for aggressive\r\nwarfare that the offense becomes one of international consequence. To\r\nremove every moderating influence among the German people and to put its\r\npopulation on a total war footing, the conspirators devised and carried\r\nout a systematic and relentless repression of all Christian sects and\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nWe will ask you to convict the Nazis on their own evidence. Martin\r\nBormann in June, 1941, issued a secret decree on the relation of\r\nChristianity and National Socialism. The decree provided:\r\n\r\n    “For the first time in German history the Fuehrer consciously\r\n    and completely has the leadership of the people in his own hand.\r\n    With the party, its components and attached units the Fuehrer\r\n    has created for himself and thereby the German Reich leadership\r\n    an instrument which makes him independent of the church. All\r\n    influences which might impair or damage the leadership of the\r\n    people exercised by the Fuehrer with help of the NSDAP, must be\r\n    eliminated. More and more the people must be separated from the\r\n    churches and their organs, the pastors. Of course, the churches\r\n    must and will, seen from their viewpoint, defend themselves\r\n    against this loss of power. But never again must an influence on\r\n    leadership of the people be yielded to the churches. This\r\n    (influence) must be broken completely and finally.\r\n\r\n    “Only the Reich government and by its direction the party, its\r\n    components and attached units have a right to leadership of the\r\n    people. Just as the deleterious influences of astrologers, seers\r\n    and other fakers are eliminated and suppressed by the state, so\r\n    must the possibility of church influence also be totally\r\n    removed. Not until this has happened, does the state leadership\r\n    have influence on the individual citizens. Not until then are\r\n    people and Reich secure in their existence for all the future”\r\n    (_D-75_).\r\n\r\nAnd how the party had been securing the Reich from Christian influence,\r\nwill be proved by such items as this teletype from the Gestapo, Berlin,\r\nto the Gestapo, Nurnberg, on July 24, 1938. Let us hear their own\r\naccount of events in Rottenburg.\r\n\r\n    “The Party on 23 July 1939 from 2100 on carried out the third\r\n    demonstration against Bishop Sproll. Participants about\r\n    2500-3000 were brought in from outside by bus, etc. The\r\n    Rottenburg populace again did not participate in the\r\n    demonstration. This town took rather a hostile attitude to the\r\n    demonstrations. The action got completely out of hand of the\r\n    Party Member responsible for it. The demonstrators stormed the\r\n    palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150 to 200 people\r\n    forced their way into the palace, searched the rooms, threw\r\n    files out of the windows and rummaged through the beds in the\r\n    rooms of the palace. One bed was ignited. Before the fire got to\r\n    the other objects of equipment in the rooms and the palace, the\r\n    flaming bed could be thrown from the window and the fire\r\n    extinguished. The Bishop was with Archbishop Groeber of Freiburg\r\n    and the ladies and gentlemen of his menage in the chapel at\r\n    prayer. About 25 to 30 people pressed into this chapel and\r\n    molested those present. Bishop Groeber was taken for Bishop\r\n    Sproll. He was grabbed by the robe and dragged back and forth.\r\n    Finally the intruders realized that Bishop Groeber is not the\r\n    one they are seeking. They could then be persuaded to leave the\r\n    building. After the evacuation of the palace by the\r\n    demonstrators I had an interview with Archbishop Groeber, who\r\n    left Rottenburg in the night. Groeber wants to turn to the\r\n    Fuehrer and Reich Minister of the Interior, Dr. Frick, anew. On\r\n    the course of the action, the damage done as well as the homage\r\n    of the Rottenburg populace beginning today for the Bishop I\r\n    shall immediately hand in a full report, after I am in the act\r\n    of suppressing counter mass meetings. * * *\r\n\r\n    “In case the Fuehrer has instructions to give in this matter, I\r\n    request that these be transmitted most quickly * * *”\r\n    (_848-PS_).\r\n\r\nLater, defendant Rosenberg wrote to Bormann reviewing the proposal of\r\nKerrl as Church Minister to place the Protestant Church under State\r\ntutelage and proclaim Hitler its Supreme head. Rosenberg was opposed,\r\nhinting that Naziism was to suppress the Christian Church completely\r\nafter the war (see _098-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe persecution of all pacifist and dissenting sects, such as Jehovah’s\r\nWitnesses and the Pentecostal Association, was peculiarly relentless and\r\ncruel. The policy toward the Evangelical Churches, however, was to use\r\ntheir influence for the Nazis’ own purposes. In September, 1933, Mueller\r\nwas appointed the Fuehrer’s representative with power to deal with the\r\n“affairs of the Evangelical Church” in its relations to the State.\r\nEventually, steps were taken to create a Reich Bishop vested with power\r\nto control this Church. A long conflict followed, Pastor Niemoeller was\r\nsent to concentration camp, and extended interference with the internal\r\ndiscipline and administration of the Churches occurred.\r\n\r\nA most intense drive was directed against the Roman Catholic Church.\r\nAfter a strategic concordat with the Holy See, signed in July, 1933 in\r\nRome, which never was observed by the Nazi Party, a long and persistent\r\npersecution of the Catholic Church, its priesthood and its members, was\r\ncarried out. Church Schools and educational institutions were suppressed\r\nor subjected to requirements of Nazi teaching inconsistent with the\r\nChristian faith. The property of the Church was confiscated and inspired\r\nvandalism directed against Church property was left unpunished.\r\nReligious instruction was impeded and the exercise of religion made\r\ndifficult. Priests and bishops were laid upon, riots were stimulated to\r\nharass them, and many were sent to concentration camps.\r\n\r\nAfter occupation of foreign soil, these persecutions went on with\r\ngreater vigor than ever. We will present to you from the files of the\r\nVatican the earnest protests made by the Vatican to Ribbentrop\r\nsummarizing the persecutions to which the priesthood and the Church had\r\nbeen subjected in this Twentieth Century under the Nazi regime.\r\nRibbentrop never answered them. He could not deny. He dared not justify.\r\n\r\n                       3. Crimes Against the Jews\r\n\r\nThe most savage and numerous crimes planned and committed by the Nazis\r\nwere those against the Jews. These in Germany, in 1933, numbered about\r\n500,000. In the aggregate, they had made for themselves positions which\r\nexcited envy, and had accumulated properties which excited the avarice\r\nof the Nazis. They were few enough to be helpless and numerous enough to\r\nbe held up as a menace.\r\n\r\nLet there be no misunderstanding about the charge of persecuting Jews.\r\nWhat we charge against these defendants is not those arrogances and\r\npretensions which frequently accompany the intermingling of different\r\npeoples and which are likely despite the honest efforts of government,\r\nto produce regrettable crimes and convulsions. It is my purpose to show\r\na plan and design, to which all Nazis were fanatically committed, to\r\nannihilate all Jewish people. These crimes were organized and promoted\r\nby the Party Leadership, executed and protected by the Nazi officials,\r\nas we shall convince you by written orders of the Secret State Police\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the Jews was a continuous and deliberate policy. It\r\nwas a policy directed against other nations as well as against the Jews\r\nthemselves. Anti-Semitism was promoted to divide and embitter the\r\ndemocratic peoples and to soften their resistance to the Nazi\r\naggression. As Robert Ley declared in _Der Angriff_ on 14 May 1944, “The\r\nsecond German secret weapon is Anti-Semitism because if it is constantly\r\npursued by Germany, it will become a universal problem which all nations\r\nwill be forced to consider.”\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism also has been aptly credited with being a “spearhead of\r\nterror.” The ghetto was the laboratory for testing repressive measures.\r\nJewish property was the first to be expropriated, but the custom grew\r\nand included similar measures against Anti-Nazi Germans, Poles, Czechs,\r\nFrenchmen, and Belgians. Extermination of the Jews enabled the Nazis to\r\nbring a practiced hand to similar measures against Poles, Serbs, and\r\nGreeks. The plight of the Jew was a constant threat to opposition or\r\ndiscontent among other elements of Europe’s population—pacifists,\r\nconservatives, communists, Catholics, Protestants, socialist. It was, in\r\nfact, a threat to every dissenting opinion and to every non-Nazi’s life.\r\n\r\nThe persecution policy against the Jews commenced with non-violent\r\nmeasures, such as disfranchisement and discriminations against their\r\nreligion, and the placing of impediments in the way of success in\r\neconomic life. It moved rapidly to organized mass violence against them,\r\nphysical isolation in ghettos, deportation, forced labor, mass\r\nstarvation, and extermination. The Government, the Party formation\r\nindicated before you as criminal organizations, the Secret State Police,\r\nthe Army, private and semi-public associations, and “spontaneous” mobs\r\nthat were carefully inspired from official sources, were all agencies\r\nconcerned in this persecution. Nor was it directed against individual\r\nJews for personal bad citizenship or unpopularity. The avowed purpose\r\nwas the destruction of the Jewish people as a whole, as an end in\r\nitself, as a measure of preparation for war, and as a discipline of\r\nconquered peoples.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy or common plan to exterminate the Jew was so methodically\r\nand thoroughly pursued that despite the German defeat and Nazi\r\nprostration, this Nazi aim largely has succeeded. Only remnants of the\r\nEuropean Jewish population remain in Germany, in the countries which\r\nGermany occupied, and in those which were her satellites or\r\ncollaborators. Of the 9,600,000 Jews who lived in Nazi-dominated Europe,\r\n60 percent are authoritatively estimated to have perished. 5,700,000\r\nJews are missing from the countries in which they formerly lived, and\r\nover 4,500,000 cannot be accounted for by the normal death rate nor by\r\nimmigration; nor are they included among displaced persons. History does\r\nnot record a crime ever perpetrated against so many victims or one ever\r\ncarried out with such calculated cruelty.\r\n\r\nYou will have difficulty, as I have, to look into the faces of these\r\ndefendants and believe that in this Twentieth Century human beings could\r\ninflict such sufferings as will be proved here on their own countrymen\r\nas well as upon their so-called “inferior” enemies. Particular crimes,\r\nand the responsibility of defendants for them, are to be dealt with by\r\nthe Soviet Government’s Counsel, when committed in the East, and by\r\nCounsel for the Republic of France when committed in the West. I advert\r\nto them only to show their magnitude as evidence of a purpose and a\r\nknowledge common to all defendants, of an official plan rather than of a\r\ncapricious policy of some individual commander, and to show such a\r\ncontinuity of Jewish persecution from the rise of the Nazi conspiracy to\r\nits collapse as forbids us to believe that any person could be\r\nidentified with any part of Nazi action without approving this most\r\nconspicuous item of its program.\r\n\r\nThe Indictment itself recites many evidences of the anti-Semitic\r\npersecutions. The defendant Streicher led the Nazis in anti-Semitic\r\nbitterness and extremism. In an article appearing in _Der Stuermer_ on\r\n19 March, 1942 he complained that Christian teachings have stood in the\r\nway of “radical solution of the Jewish question in Europe,” and quoted\r\nenthusiastically as the Twentieth Century solution the Fuehrer’s\r\nproclamation of February 24, 1942 that “the Jew will be exterminated.”\r\nAnd on November 4, 1943, Streicher declared in _Der Stuermer_ that the\r\nJews “have disappeared from Europe and that the Jewish ‘Reservoir of the\r\nEast’ from which the Jewish plague has for centuries beset the people of\r\nEurope, has ceased to exist.” Streicher now has the effrontery to tell\r\nus he is “only a Zionist”—he says he wants only to return the Jews to\r\nPalestine. But on May 7, 1942 his newspaper, _Der Stuermer_, had this to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n    “It is also not only an European problem! _The Jewish question\r\n    is a world question!_ Not only is Germany not safe in the face\r\n    of the Jews as long as one Jew lives in Europe, but also the\r\n    Jewish question is hardly solved in Europe so long as Jews live\r\n    in the rest of the world.”\r\n\r\nAnd the defendant Hans Frank, a lawyer by profession I say with shame,\r\nsummarized in his Diary in 1944 the Nazi policy thus: “The Jews are a\r\nrace which has to be eliminated; whenever we catch one, it is his end.”\r\n(Frank Diary, 4 March 1944, p. 26). And earlier, speaking of his\r\nfunction as Governor-General of Poland, he confided to his diary this\r\nsentiment: “Of course I cannot eliminate all lice and Jews in only a\r\nyear’s time.” (_2233-C-PS_) I could multiply endlessly this kind of Nazi\r\nranting but I will leave it to the evidence and turn to the fruit of\r\nthis perverted thinking.\r\n\r\nThe most serious of the actions against Jews were outside of any law,\r\nbut the law itself was employed to some extent. There were the infamous\r\nNurnberg decrees of September 15, 1935 (_Reichsgesetzblatt_ 1935, Part\r\nI, p. 1146). The Jews were segregated into ghettos and put into forced\r\nlabor; they were expelled from their professions; their property was\r\nexpropriated; all cultural life, the press, the theatre, and schools\r\nwere prohibited them; and the SD was made responsible for them\r\n(_212-PS_; _069-PS_). This was an ominous guardianship, as the following\r\norder for “The Handling of the Jewish Question” shows:\r\n\r\n    “The competency of the Chief of the Security Police and Security\r\n    Service, who is charged with the mission of solving the European\r\n    Jewish question, extends even to the occupied eastern provinces.\r\n    * * *\r\n\r\n    “An eventual act by the civilian population against the Jews is\r\n    not to be prevented as long as this is compatible with the\r\n    maintenance of order and security in the rear of the fighting\r\n    troops * * *\r\n\r\n    “The first main goal of the German measures must be strict\r\n    segregation of Jewry from the rest of the population. In the\r\n    execution of this, first of all is the seizing of the Jewish\r\n    populace by the introduction of a registration order and similar\r\n    appropriate measures * * *\r\n\r\n    “Then immediately, the wearing of the recognition sign\r\n    consisting of a yellow Jewish star is to be brought about and\r\n    all rights of freedom for Jews are to be withdrawn. They are to\r\n    be placed in Ghettos and at the same time are to be separated\r\n    according to sexes. The presence of many more or less closed\r\n    Jewish settlements in White Ruthenia and in the Ukraine makes\r\n    this mission easier. Moreover, places are to be chosen which\r\n    make possible the full use of the Jewish manpower in case labor\r\n    needs are present * * *\r\n\r\n    “The entire Jewish property is to be seized and confiscated with\r\n    exception of that which is necessary for a bare existence. As\r\n    far as the economical situation permits, the power of disposal\r\n    of their property is to be taken from the Jews as soon as\r\n    possible through orders and other measures given by the\r\n    commissariate, so that the moving of property will quickly\r\n    cease.\r\n\r\n    “Any cultural activity will be completely forbidden, to the Jew.\r\n    This includes the outlawing of the Jewish press, the Jewish\r\n    theatres and schools.\r\n\r\n    “The slaughtering of animals according to Jewish rites is also\r\n    to be prohibited * * *” (_212-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe anti-Jewish campaign became furious in Germany following the\r\nassassination in Paris of the German Legation Councillor von Rath.\r\nHeydrich, Gestapo head, sent a teletype to all Gestapo and SD offices\r\nwith directions for handling “spontaneous” uprising anticipated for the\r\nnights of November 9 and 10, 1938, so as to aid in destruction of\r\nJewish-owned property and protect only that of Germans (_374-PS_;\r\n_765-PS_). No more cynical document ever came into evidence. Then there\r\nis a report by an SS Brigade Leader, Dr. Stahlecher, to Himmler, which\r\nrecites that:\r\n\r\n    “Similarly, native anti-Semitic forces were induced to start\r\n    pogroms against Jews during the first hours after capture,\r\n    though this inducement proved to be very difficult. Following\r\n    our orders, the Security Police was determined to solve the\r\n    Jewish question with all possible means and most decisively. But\r\n    it was desirable that the Security Police should not put in an\r\n    immediate appearance, at least in the beginning, since the\r\n    extraordinarily harsh measures were apt to stir even German\r\n    circles. It had to be shown to the world that the native\r\n    population itself took the first action by way of natural\r\n    reaction against the suppression by Jews during several decades\r\n    and against the terror exercised by the Communists during the\r\n    preceding period.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In view of the extension of the area of operations and the\r\n    great number of duties which had to be performed by the Security\r\n    Police, it was intended from the very beginning to obtain the\r\n    cooperation of the reliable population for the fight against\r\n    vermin—that is mainly the Jews and Communists. Beyond our\r\n    directing of the first spontaneous actions of self-cleansing,\r\n    which will be reported elsewhere, care had to be taken that\r\n    reliable people should be put to the cleansing job and that they\r\n    were appointed auxiliary members of the Security Police.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Kowno * * * To our surprise it was not easy at first to set in\r\n    motion an extensive pogrom against Jews. KLIMATIS, the leader of\r\n    the partisan unit, mentioned above, who was used for this\r\n    purpose primarily, succeeded in starting a pogrom on the basis\r\n    of advice given to him by a small advanced detachment acting in\r\n    Kowno, and in such a way that no German order or German\r\n    instigation was noticed from the outside. During the first\r\n    pogrom in the night from 25. to 26.6 the Lithuanian partisans\r\n    did away with more than 1,500 Jews, set fire to several\r\n    synagogues or destroyed them by other means and burned down a\r\n    Jewish dwelling district consisting of about 60 houses. During\r\n    the following nights about 2,300 Jews were made harmless in a\r\n    similar way. In other parts of Lithuania similar actions\r\n    followed the example of Kowno, though smaller and extending to\r\n    the Communists who had been left behind.\r\n\r\n    “These self-cleansing actions went smoothly because the Army\r\n    authorities who had been informed showed understanding for this\r\n    procedure. From the beginning it was obvious that only the first\r\n    days after the occupation would offer the opportunity for\r\n    carrying out pogroms. After the disarmament of the partisans the\r\n    self-cleansing actions ceased necessarily.\r\n\r\n    “It proved much more difficult to set in motion similar\r\n    cleansing actions in Latvia.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “From the beginning it was to be expected that the Jewish\r\n    problem in the East could not be solved by pogroms alone. In\r\n    accordance with the basic orders received, however, the\r\n    cleansing activities of the Security Police had to aim at a\r\n    complete annihilation of the Jews * * *\r\n\r\n    “The sum total of the Jews liquidated in Lithuania amounts to\r\n    71,105.” (_L-180_).\r\n\r\nOf course, it is self-evident that these “uprisings” were managed by the\r\ngovernment and the Nazi Party. If we were in doubt, we could resort to\r\nStreicher’s memorandum of April 14, 1939, which says, “The anti-Jewish\r\naction of November, 1938 did not arise spontaneously from the people. *\r\n* * Part of the party formation have been charged with the execution of\r\nthe anti-Jewish action.” (_406-PS_). Jews as a whole were fined a\r\nbillion Reichsmarks. They were excluded from all businesses, and claims\r\nagainst insurance companies for their burned properties were\r\nconfiscated, all by decree of the defendant Goering\r\n(_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1938, Part I, Pp. 1579-1582).\r\n\r\nSynagogues were the objects of a special vengeance. On November 10,\r\n1938, the following order was given: “By order of the Group Commander,\r\nall Jewish Synagogues in the area of Brigade 50 have to be blown up or\r\nset afire. * * * The operation will be carried out in civilian clothing.\r\n* * * Execution of the order will be reported * * *.” (_1721-PS_). Some\r\n40 teletype messages from various police headquarters will tell the fury\r\nwith which all Jews were pursued in Germany on those awful November\r\nnights. The SS troops were turned loose and the Gestapo supervised.\r\nJewish-owned property was authorized to be destroyed. The Gestapo\r\nordered twenty to thirty thousand “well-to-do Jews” to be arrested.\r\nConcentration camps were to receive them. Healthy Jews, fit for labor,\r\nwere to be taken (_3051-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs the German frontiers were expanded by war, so the campaign against\r\nthe Jews expanded. The Nazi plan never was limited to extermination in\r\nGermany; always it contemplated extinguishing the Jew in Europe and\r\noften in the world. In the west, the Jews were killed and their property\r\ntaken over. But the campaign achieved its zenith of savagery in the\r\nEast. The Eastern Jew has suffered as no people ever suffered. Their\r\nsufferings were carefully reported to the Nazi authorities to show\r\nfaithful adherence to the Nazi design. I shall refer only to enough of\r\nthe evidence of these to show the extent of the Nazi design for killing\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nIf I should recite these horrors in words of my own, you would think me\r\nintemperate and unreliable. Fortunately, we need not take the word of\r\nany witness but the Germans themselves. I invite you now to look at a\r\nfew of the vast number of captured German orders and reports that will\r\nbe offered in evidence, to see what a Nazi invasion meant. We will\r\npresent such evidence as the report of _Einsatzgruppe_ (Action Group) A\r\nof October 15, 1941, which boasts that in overrunning the Baltic States,\r\n“Native Anti-Semitic forces were induced to start pogroms against the\r\nJews during the first hours after occupation * * *.” The report\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n    “From the beginning it was to be expected that the Jewish\r\n    problem in the East could not be solved by pogroms alone. In\r\n    accordance with the basic orders received, however, the\r\n    cleansing activities of the Security Police had to aim at a\r\n    complete annihilation of the Jews. Special detachments\r\n    reinforced by selected units—in Lithuania partisan detachments,\r\n    in Latvia units of the Latvian auxiliary police—therefore\r\n    performed extensive executions both in the towns and in rural\r\n    areas. The actions of the execution detachments were performed\r\n    smoothly.\r\n\r\n    “The sum total of the Jews liquidated in Lithuania amounts to\r\n    71,105. During the pogroms in Kowno 3,800 Jews were eliminated,\r\n    in the smaller towns about 1,200 Jews.\r\n\r\n    “In Latvia, up to now a total of 30,000 Jews were executed. 500\r\n    were eliminated by pogroms in Riga.” (_L-180_).\r\n\r\nThis is a captured report from the Commissioner of Sluzk on October 30,\r\n1941, which describes the scene in more detail. It says:\r\n\r\n    “The first lieutenant explained that the police battalion had\r\n    received the assignment to effect the liquidation of all Jews\r\n    here in the town of Sluzk, within two days. Then I requested him\r\n    to postpone the action one day. However, he rejected this with\r\n    the remark that he had to carry out this action everywhere and\r\n    in all towns and that only two days were allotted for Sluzk.\r\n    Within these two days, the town of Sluzk had to be cleared of\r\n    Jews by all means. * * * All Jews without exception were taken\r\n    out of the factories and shops and deported in spite of our\r\n    agreement. It is true that part of the Jews was moved by way of\r\n    the ghetto where many of them were processed and still\r\n    segregated by me, but a large part was loaded directly on trucks\r\n    and liquidated without further delay outside of the town. * * *\r\n    For the rest, as regards the execution of the action, I must\r\n    point out to my deepest regret that the latter bordered already\r\n    on sadism. The town itself offered a picture of horror during\r\n    the action. With indescribable brutality on the part of both the\r\n    German police officers and particularly the Lithuanian\r\n    partisans, the Jewish people, but also among them White\r\n    Ruthenians, were taken out of their dwellings and herded\r\n    together. Everywhere in the town shots were to be heard and in\r\n    different streets the corpses of shot Jews accumulated. The\r\n    White Ruthenians were in greatest distress to free themselves\r\n    from the encirclement. Regardless of the fact that the Jewish\r\n    people, among whom were also tradesmen, were mistreated in a\r\n    terribly barbarous way in the face of the White Ruthenian\r\n    people, the White Ruthenians themselves were also worked over\r\n    with rubber clubs and rifle butts. There was no question of an\r\n    action against the Jews any more. It rather looked like a\r\n    revolution. * * *” (_1104-PS_).\r\n\r\nThere are reports which merely tabulate the numbers slaughtered. An\r\nexample is an account of the work of _Einsatzgruppen_ of Sipo and SD in\r\nthe East, which relates that—\r\n\r\n    In Estonia, all Jews were arrested immediately upon the arrival\r\n    of the Wehrmacht. Jewish men and women above the age of 16 and\r\n    capable of work were drafted for forced labor. Jews were\r\n    subjected to all sorts of restrictions and all Jewish property\r\n    was confiscated.\r\n\r\n    All Jewish males above the age of 16 were executed, with the\r\n    exception of doctors and elders. Only 500 of an original 4,500\r\n    Jews remained.\r\n\r\n    37,180 persons have been liquidated by the Sipo and SD in White\r\n    Ruthenia during October.\r\n\r\n    In one town, 337 Jewish women were executed for demonstrating a\r\n    “provocative attitude.” In another, 380 Jews were shot for\r\n    spreading vicious propaganda.\r\n\r\nAnd so the report continues, listing town after town, where hundreds\r\nupon hundreds of Jews were murdered.\r\n\r\n    In Witebsk 3,000 Jews were liquidated because of the danger of\r\n    epidemics.\r\n\r\n    In Kiew, 33,771 Jews were executed on September 29 and 30 in\r\n    retaliation for some fires which were set off there.\r\n\r\n    In Shitomir, 3,145 Jews “had to be shot” because, judging from\r\n    experience they had to be considered as the carriers of\r\n    Bolshevik propaganda.\r\n\r\n    In Cherson, 410 Jews were executed in reprisal against acts of\r\n    sabotage.\r\n\r\n    In the territory east of the Djnepr, the Jewish problem was\r\n    “solved” by the liquidation of 4,891 Jews and by putting the\r\n    remainder into labor battalions of up to 1,000 persons\r\n    (_R-102_).\r\n\r\nOther accounts tell not of the slaughter so much as of the depths of\r\ndegradation to which the tormentors stooped. For example, we will show\r\nthe reports made to defendant Rosenberg about the army and the SS in the\r\narea under Rosenberg’s jurisdiction, which recited the following:\r\n\r\n    “Details: In presence of SS man, a Jewish dentist has to break\r\n    all gold teeth and fillings out of mouth of German and Russian\r\n    Jews _before_ they are executed.”\r\n\r\n    Men, women and children are locked into barns and burned alive.\r\n\r\n    Peasants, women and children are shot on pretext that they are\r\n    suspected of belonging to bands (_R-135_).\r\n\r\nWe of the Western World heard of Gas Wagons in which Jews and political\r\nopponents were asphyxiated. We could not believe it. But here we have\r\nthe report of May 16, 1942 from the German SS officer, Becker, to his\r\nsupervisor in Berlin which tells this story:\r\n\r\n    Gas vans in C. group can be driven to execution spot, which is\r\n    generally stationed 10 to 15 kms. from main road only in dry\r\n    weather. Since those to be executed become frantic if conducted\r\n    to this place, such vans become immobilized in wet weather.\r\n\r\n    Gas vans in D. group camouflaged as cabin trailers, but vehicles\r\n    well known to authorities and civilian population which calls\r\n    them “Death Vans”.\r\n\r\n    Writer of letter (Becker) ordered all men to keep as far away as\r\n    possible during gassing. Unloading van has “atrocious spiritual\r\n    and physical effect” on men and they should be ordered not to\r\n    participate in such work (_501-PS_).\r\n\r\nI shall not dwell on this subject longer than to quote one more\r\nsickening document which evidences the planned and systematic character\r\nof the Jewish persecutions. I hold a report written with Teutonic\r\ndevotion to detail, illustrated with photographs to authenticate its\r\nalmost incredible text, and beautifully bound in leather with the loving\r\ncare bestowed on a proud work. It is the original report of the SS\r\nBrigadier General Stroop in charge of the destruction of the Warsaw\r\nGhetto, and its title page carries the inscription, “The Jewish Ghetto\r\nin Warsaw no longer exists.” It is characteristic that one of the\r\ncaptions explains that the photograph concerned shows the driving out of\r\nJewish “bandits”; those whom the photograph shows being driven out are\r\nalmost entirely women and little children. It contains a day-by-day\r\naccount of the killings mainly carried out by the SS organization, too\r\nlong to relate, but let me quote General Stroop’s summary:\r\n\r\n    “The resistance put up by the Jews and bandits could only be\r\n    suppressed by energetic actions of our troops day and night.\r\n    _The Reichsfuehrer SS ordered, therefore on 23 April 1943 the\r\n    cleaning out of the ghetto with utter ruthlessness and merciless\r\n    tenacity._ I, therefore, decided to destroy and burn down the\r\n    entire ghetto without regard to the armament factories. These\r\n    factories were systematically dismantled and then burned. Jews\r\n    usually left their hideouts, but frequently remained in the\r\n    burning buildings and jumped out of the windows only when the\r\n    heat became unbearable. They then tried to crawl with broken\r\n    bones across the street into buildings which were not afire.\r\n    Sometimes they changed their hideouts during the night into the\r\n    ruins of burned buildings. Life in the sewers was not pleasant\r\n    after the first week. Many times we could hear loud voices in\r\n    the sewers. SS men or policemen climbed bravely through the\r\n    manholes to capture these Jews. Sometimes they stumbled over\r\n    Jewish corpses; sometimes they were shot at. Tear gas bombs were\r\n    thrown into the manholes and the Jews driven out of the sewers\r\n    and captured. Countless numbers of Jews were liquidated in\r\n    sewers and bunkers through blasting. The longer the resistance\r\n    continued the tougher became the members of the Waffen SS police\r\n    and Wehrmacht who always discharged their duties in an exemplary\r\n    manner. Frequently Jews who tried to replenish their food\r\n    supplies during the night or to communicate with neighboring\r\n    groups were exterminated.” (_1061-PS_).\r\n\r\nThis action eliminated, says the SS commander, “a proved total of\r\n56,065. To that we have to add the number of those killed through\r\nblasting, fire, etc., which cannot be counted.”\r\n\r\nWe charge that all atrocities against Jews were the manifestation and\r\nculmination of the Nazi plan to which every defendant here was a party.\r\nI know very well that some of these men did take steps to spare some\r\nparticular Jew for some personal reason from the horrors that awaited\r\nthe unrescued Jew. Some protested that particular atrocities were\r\nexcessive, and discredited the general policy. While a few defendants\r\nmay show efforts to make specific exceptions to the policy of Jewish\r\nextermination, I have found no instance in which any defendant opposed\r\nthe policy itself or sought to revoke or even modify it.\r\n\r\nDetermination to destroy the Jews was a binding force which at all times\r\ncemented the elements of this conspiracy. On many internal policies\r\nthere were differences among the defendants. But there is not one of\r\nthem who has not echoed the rallying cry of Naziism—_DEUTSCHLAND\r\nERWACHE JUDA VERRECKE!_ (GERMANY AWAKE, JEWRY PERISH!)\r\n\r\n                   TERRORISM AND PREPARATION FOR WAR\r\n\r\nHow a Government treats its own inhabitants generally is thought to be\r\nno concern of other Governments or of international society. Certainly\r\nfew oppressions or cruelties would warrant the intervention of foreign\r\npowers. But the German mistreatment of Germans is now known to pass in\r\nmagnitude and savagery any limits of what is tolerable by modern\r\ncivilization. Other nations, by silence, would take a consenting part in\r\nsuch crimes. These Nazi persecutions, moreover, take character as\r\ninternational crimes because of the purpose for which they were\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nThe purpose, as we have seen, of getting rid of the influence of free\r\nlabor, the churches, and the Jews was to clear their obstruction to the\r\nprecipitation of aggressive war. If aggressive warfare in violation of\r\ntreaty obligation is a matter of international cognizance, the\r\npreparations for it must also be of concern to the international\r\ncommunity. Terrorism was the chief instrument for securing the cohesion\r\nof the German people in war purposes. Moreover, these cruelties in\r\nGermany served as atrocity practice to discipline the membership of the\r\ncriminal organization to follow the pattern later in occupied countries.\r\n\r\nThrough the police formations that before you are accused as criminal\r\norganizations, the Nazi Party leaders, aided at some point in their\r\nbasic and notorious purpose by each of the individual defendants\r\ninstituted a reign of terror. These espionage and police organizations\r\nwere utilized to hunt down every form of opposition and to penalize\r\nevery nonconformity. These organizations early founded and administered\r\nconcentration camps—Buchenwald in 1933, Dachau in 1934. But these\r\nnotorious names were not alone. Concentration camps came to dot the\r\nGerman map and to number scores. At first they met with resistance from\r\nsome Germans. We have a captured letter from Minister of Justice\r\nGuertner to Hitler which is revealing. A Gestapo official had been\r\nprosecuted for crimes committed in the camp at Hohnstein, and the Nazi\r\nGovernor of Saxony had promptly asked that the proceeding be quashed.\r\nThe Minister of Justice in June of 1935 protested because, as he said:\r\n\r\n    “In this camp unusually grave mistreatments of prisoners have\r\n    occurred at least since Summer 1933. The prisoners not only were\r\n    beaten with whips without cause, similarly as in the\r\n    Concentration Camp Bredow near Stettin till they lost\r\n    consciousness, but they were also tortured in other manners,\r\n    e.g. with the help of a dripping apparatus constructed\r\n    exclusively for this purpose, under which prisoners had to stand\r\n    until they were suffering from serious purulent wounds of the\r\n    scalp * * *” (_787-PS_).\r\n\r\nI shall not take time to detail the ghastly proceedings in these\r\nconcentration camps. Beatings, starvings, tortures, and killings were\r\nroutine—so routine that the tormenters became blase and careless. We\r\nhave a report of discovery that in Ploetzens one night, 186 persons were\r\nexecuted while there were orders for only 180. Another report describes\r\nhow the family of one victim received two urns of ashes by mistake.\r\nInmates were compelled to execute each other. In 1942, they were paid\r\nfive Reichsmarks per execution, but on June 27, 1942, SS General Gluecks\r\nordered commandants of all concentration camps to reduce this honorarium\r\nto three cigarettes. In 1943, the Reichsleader of the SS and Chief of\r\nGerman Police ordered the corporal punishments on Russian women to be\r\napplied by Polish women and vice versa, but the price was not frozen.\r\n“As reward, a few cigarettes” was authorized. Under the Nazis, human\r\nlife had been progressively devalued until it finally became worth less\r\nthan a handful of tobacco—ersatz tobacco. There were, however, some\r\ntraces of the milk of human kindness. On August 11, 1942, an order went\r\nfrom Himmler to the commanders of fourteen concentration camps that\r\n“only German prisoners are allowed to beat other German prisoners.”\r\n(_2189-PS_).\r\n\r\nMystery and suspense was added to cruelty in order to spread torture\r\nfrom the inmate to his family and friends. Men and women disappeared\r\nfrom their homes or business or from the streets, and no word came of\r\nthem. The omission of notice was not due to overworked staff; it was due\r\nto policy. The Chief of the SD and Sipo reported that in accordance with\r\norders from the Fuehrer anxiety should be created in the minds of the\r\nfamily of the arrested person (_668-PS_). Deportations and secret\r\narrests were labeled, with a Nazi wit which seems a little ghoulish,\r\n_Nacht und Nebel_ (Night and Fog) (_L-90, 833-PS_). One of the many\r\norders for these actions gave this explanation:\r\n\r\n    “The decree carries a basic innovation. The Fuehrer and\r\n    Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces commands that crimes of\r\n    the specified sort committed by civilians of the occupied\r\n    territories are to be punished by the pertinent courts-martial\r\n    in the occupied territories _only_ when\r\n\r\n    _a._ the sentence calls for the death penalty, and\r\n\r\n    _b._ the sentence is pronounced within 8 days after the arrest.\r\n\r\n    “Only when both conditions are met does the Fuehrer and\r\n    Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces hope for the desired\r\n    deterrent effect from the conduct of punitive proceedings in the\r\n    occupied territories.\r\n\r\n    “In other cases in the future the accused are to be secretly\r\n    brought to Germany and the further conduct of the trial carried\r\n    on here. The deterrent effect of those measures lies\r\n\r\n    _a._ in allowing the disappearance of the accused without a\r\n    trace,\r\n\r\n    _b._ therein, that no information whatsoever may be given about\r\n    their whereabouts and their fate.” (_833-PS_).\r\n\r\nTo clumsy cruelty, scientific skill was added. “Undesirables” were\r\nexterminated by injection of drugs into the bloodstream, by asphyxiation\r\nin gas chambers. They were shot with poison bullets, to study the\r\neffects (_L-103_).\r\n\r\nThen, to cruel experiments the Nazi added obscene ones. These were not\r\nthe work of underling degenerates but of master minds high in the Nazi\r\nconspiracy. In May 20, 1942, General Field Marshal Milch authorized SS\r\nGeneral Wolff to go ahead at Dachau Camp with so-called “cold\r\nexperiments”; and four female gypsies were supplied for the purpose.\r\nHimmler gave permission to carry on these “experiments” also in other\r\ncamps (_1617-PS_). At Dachau, the reports of the “doctor” in charge show\r\nthat victims were immersed in cold water until their body temperature\r\nwas reduced to 28 degrees centigrade (82.4 degrees Fahrenheit), when\r\nthey all died immediately (_1618-PS_). This was in August 1942. But the\r\n“doctor’s” technique improved. By February, 1943, he was able to report\r\nthat thirty persons were chilled to 27 to 29 degrees, their hands and\r\nfeet frozen white, and their bodies “rewarmed” by a hot bath. But the\r\nNazi scientific triumph was “rewarming with animal heat.” The victim,\r\nall but frozen to death, was surrounded with bodies of living women\r\nuntil he revived and responded to his environment by having sexual\r\nintercourse (_1616-PS_). Here Nazi degeneracy reached its nadir.\r\n\r\nI dislike to encumber the record with such morbid tales, but we are in\r\nthe grim business of trying men as criminals, and these are the things\r\ntheir own agents say happened. We will show you these concentration\r\ncamps in motion pictures, just as the Allied armies found them when they\r\narrived, and the measures General Eisenhower had to take to clean them\r\nup. Our proof will be disgusting and you will say I have robbed you of\r\nyour sleep. But these are the things which have turned the stomach of\r\nthe world and set every civilized hand against Nazi Germany.\r\n\r\nGermany became one vast torture chamber. Cries of its victims were heard\r\nround the world and brought shudders to civilized people everywhere. I\r\nam one who received during this war most atrocity tales with suspicion\r\nand skepticism. But the proof here will be so overwhelming that I\r\nventure to predict not one word I have spoken will be denied. These\r\ndefendants will only deny personal responsibility or knowledge.\r\n\r\nUnder the clutch of the most intricate web of espionage and intrigue\r\nthat any modern state has endured, and persecution and torture of a kind\r\nthat has not been visited upon the world in many centuries, the elements\r\nof the German population which were both decent and courageous were\r\nannihilated. Those which were decent but weak were intimidated. Open\r\nresistance, which had never been more than feeble and irresolute,\r\ndisappeared. But resistance, I am happy to say, always remained,\r\nalthough it was manifest in only such events as the abortive effort to\r\nassassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944. With resistance driven underground,\r\nthe Nazi had the German State in his own hands.\r\n\r\nBut the Nazis not only silenced discordant voices. They created positive\r\ncontrols as effective as their negative ones. Propaganda organs, on a\r\nscale never before known, stimulated the party and party formations with\r\na permanent enthusiasm and abandon such as we democratic people can work\r\nup only for a few days before a general election. They inculcated and\r\npracticed the _fuehrerprinzip_, which centralized control of the Party\r\nand of the Party-controlled state over the lives and thought of the\r\nGerman people, who are accustomed to look upon the German State by\r\nwhomever controlled with a mysticism that is incomprehensible to my\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAll these controls from their inception were exerted with unparalleled\r\nenergy and singlemindedness to put Germany on a war footing. We will\r\nshow from the Nazis’ own documents their secret training of military\r\npersonnel, their secret creation of a military air force. Finally, a\r\nconscript army was brought into being. Financiers, economists,\r\nindustrialists, joined in the plan and promoted elaborate alterations in\r\nindustry and finance to support an unprecedented concentration of\r\nresources and energies upon preparations for war. Germany’s rearmament\r\nso outstripped the strength of her neighbors that in about a year she\r\nwas able to crush the whole military force of Continental Europe,\r\nexclusive of that of Soviet Russia, and then to push the Russian armies\r\nback to the Volga. These preparations were of a magnitude which\r\nsurpassed all need of defense and every defendant, and every intelligent\r\nGerman, well understood them to be for aggressive purposes.\r\n\r\n                       EXPERIMENTS IN AGGRESSION\r\n\r\nBefore resorting to open aggressive warfare, the Nazis undertook some\r\nrather cautious experiments to test the spirit and resistance of those\r\nwho lay across their path. They advanced, but only as others yielded,\r\nand kept in a position to draw back if they found a temper that made\r\npersistence dangerous.\r\n\r\nOn 7 March 1936, the Nazis reoccupied the Rhineland and then proceeded\r\nto fortify it in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Pact of\r\nLocarno. They encountered no substantial resistance and were emboldened\r\nto take the next step, which was the acquisition of Austria. Despite\r\nrepeated assurances that Germany had no designs on Austria, invasion was\r\nperfected. Threat of attack forced Schuschnigg to resign as Chancellor\r\nof Austria and put the Nazi defendant Seyss-Inquart in his place. The\r\nlatter immediately opened the frontier and invited Hitler to invade\r\nAustria “to preserve order.” On March 12th the invasion began. The next\r\nday, Hitler proclaimed himself Chief of the Austrian State, took command\r\nof its armed forces, and a law was enacted annexing Austria to Germany.\r\n\r\nThreats of aggression had succeeded without arousing resistance. Fears\r\nnevertheless had been stirred. They were lulled by an assurance to the\r\nCzechoslovak Government that there would be no attack on that country.\r\nWe will show that the Nazi Government already had detailed plans for the\r\nattack. We will lay before you the documents in which these conspirators\r\nplanned to create an incident to justify their attack. They even gave\r\nconsideration to assassinating their own Ambassador at Prague in order\r\nto create a sufficiently dramatic incident. They did precipitate a\r\ndiplomatic crisis which endured through the summer. Hitler set September\r\n30th as the day when troops should be ready for action. Under the threat\r\nof immediate war, the United Kingdom and France concluded a pact with\r\nGermany and Italy at Munich on September 29, 1938 which required\r\nCzechoslovakia to acquiesce in the cession of the Sudetenland to\r\nGermany. It was consummated by German occupation on October 1, 1938.\r\n\r\nThe Munich Pact pledged no further aggression against Czechoslovakia,\r\nbut the Nazi pledge was lightly given and quickly broken. On the 15th of\r\nMarch, 1939, in defiance of the treaty of Munich itself, the Nazis\r\nseized and occupied Bohemia and Moravia, which constituted the major\r\npart of Czechoslovakia not already ceded to Germany. Once again the West\r\nstood aghast, but it dreaded war, it saw no remedy except war, and it\r\nhoped against hope that the Nazi fever for expansion had run its course.\r\nBut the Nazi world was intoxicated by these unresisted successes in open\r\nalliance with Mussolini and covert alliance with Franco. Then, having\r\nmade a deceitful, delaying peace with Russia, the conspirators entered\r\nupon the final phase of the plan to renew war.\r\n\r\n                           WAR OF AGGRESSION\r\n\r\nI will not prolong this address by detailing the steps leading to the\r\nwar of aggression which began with the invasion of Poland on September,\r\n1, 1939. The further story will be unfolded to you from documents\r\nincluding those of the German High Command itself. The plans had been\r\nlaid long in advance. As early as 1935 Hitler appointed the defendant\r\nSchacht to the position of “General Deputy for the War Economy.”\r\n(_2261-PS_). We have the diary of General Jodl (_1780-PS_); the “Plan\r\nOtto,” Hitler’s own order for attack on Austria in case trickery failed\r\n(_C-102_); the “Plan Green” which was the blueprint for attack on\r\nCzechoslovakia (_388-PS_); plans for the War in the West (_376-PS_,\r\n_375-PS_); Funk’s letter to Hitler dated August 25, 1939, detailing the\r\nlong course of economic preparation (_699-PS_); Keitel’s top secret\r\nmobilization order for 1939-40 prescribing secret steps to be taken\r\nduring a “period of tension” during which no “‘state of war’ will be\r\npublicly declared even if open war measures against the foreign enemy\r\nwill be taken.” This latter order (_1639-A-PS_) is in our possession\r\ndespite a secret order issued on March 16, 1945, when Allied troops were\r\nadvancing into the heart of Germany, to burn these plans. We have also\r\nHitler’s directive, dated December 18, 1940, for the “Barbarossa\r\nContingency” outlining the strategy of the attack upon Russia\r\n(_446-PS_). That plan in the original bears the initials of the\r\ndefendants Keitel and Jodl. They were planning the attack and planning\r\nit long in advance of the declaration of war. We have detailed\r\ninformation concerning “Case White,” the plan for attack on Poland\r\n(_C-120_). That attack began the war. The plan was issued by Keitel on\r\nApril 3rd, 1939. The attack did not come until September. Steps in\r\npreparation for the attack were taken by subordinate commanders, one of\r\nwhom issued an order on June 14, providing that:\r\n\r\n    “The Commander-in-Chief of the Army has ordered the working out\r\n    of a _plan of deployment against Poland_ which takes in account\r\n    the demands of the political leadership _for the opening of war\r\n    by surprise and for quick success_ * * *\r\n\r\n    “I declare it the duty of the Commanding Generals, the\r\n    divisional commanders and the commandants to limit as much as\r\n    possible the number of persons who will be informed, and to\r\n    limit the extent of the information, and ask that all suitable\r\n    measures be taken to prevent persons not concerned from getting\r\n    information.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The operation, in order to forestall an orderly Polish\r\n    mobilization and concentration, is to be opened by surprise with\r\n    forces which are for the most part armored and motorized, placed\r\n    on alert in the neighborhood of the border. The initial\r\n    superiority over the Polish frontier-guards and surprise that\r\n    can be expected with certainty are to be maintained by quickly\r\n    bringing up other parts of the army as well to counteract the\r\n    marching up of the Polish Army.\r\n\r\n    “If the development of the Political situation should show that\r\n    a surprise at the beginning of the war is out of question,\r\n    because of well advanced defense preparations on the part of the\r\n    Polish Army, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army will order the\r\n    opening of the hostilities only after the assembling of\r\n    sufficient additional forces. The basis of all preparations will\r\n    be to surprise the enemy.” (_2327-PS_).\r\n\r\nWe have also the order for the invasion of England, signed by Hitler and\r\ninitialed by Keitel and Jodl. It is interesting that it commences with a\r\nrecognition that although the British military position is “hopeless,”\r\nthey show not the slightest sign of giving in (_442-PS_).\r\n\r\nNot the least incriminating are the minutes of Hitler’s meeting with his\r\nhigh advisers. As early as November 5, 1937, Hitler told defendants\r\nGoering, Raeder, and Neurath, among others, that German rearmament was\r\npractically accomplished and that he had decided to secure by force,\r\nstarting with a lightning attack on Czechoslovakia and Austria, greater\r\nliving space for Germans in Europe no later than 1943-45 and perhaps as\r\nearly as 1938 (_386-PS_). On the 23rd of May, 1939, the Fuehrer advised\r\nhis staff that—\r\n\r\n    “It is a question of expanding our living space in the East and\r\n    of securing our food supplies * * * over and above the natural\r\n    fertility, thorough-going German exploitation will enormously\r\n    increase the surplus.”\r\n\r\n    “There is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and we are\r\n    left with the decision: _To attack Poland at the first suitable\r\n    opportunity_. We cannot expect a repetition of the Czech affair.\r\n    There will be war.” (_L-79_).\r\n\r\nOn August 22nd, 1939 Hitler again addressed members of the High Command,\r\ntelling them when the start of military operations would be ordered. He\r\ndisclosed that for propaganda purposes, he would provocate a good\r\nreason. “It will make no difference,” he announced, “whether this reason\r\nwill sound convincing or not. After all, the victor will not be asked\r\nwhether he talked the truth or not. We have to proceed brutally. The\r\nstronger is always right.” (_1014-PS_). On 23 November 1939 after the\r\nGermans had invaded Poland, Hitler made this explanation:\r\n\r\n    “For the first time in history we have to fight on only one\r\n    front, the other front is at present free. But no one can know\r\n    how long that will remain so. I have doubted for a long time\r\n    whether I should strike in the east and then in the west.\r\n    Basically I did not organize the armed forces in order not to\r\n    strike. The decision to strike was always in me. Earlier or\r\n    later I wanted to solve the problem. Under pressure it was\r\n    decided that the east was to be attacked first * * *”\r\n    (_789-PS_).\r\n\r\nWe know the bloody sequel. Frontier incidents were staged. Demands were\r\nmade for cession of territory. When Poland refused, the German forces\r\ninvaded on September 1st, 1939. Warsaw was destroyed; Poland fell. The\r\nNazis, in accordance with plan, moved swiftly to extend their aggression\r\nthroughout Europe and to gain the advantage of surprise over their\r\nunprepared neighbors. Despite repeated and solemn assurances of peaceful\r\nintentions, they invaded Denmark and Norway on 9th April, 1940; Belgium,\r\nThe Netherlands and Luxembourg on 10th May, 1940; Yugoslavia and Greece\r\non 6th April, 1941.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Nazi preparation for aggression against Poland and her\r\nallies, Germany, on 23rd August, 1939 had entered into a nonaggression\r\npact with Soviet-Russia. It was only a delaying treaty intended to be\r\nkept no longer than necessary to prepare for its violation. On June 22,\r\n1941, pursuant to long matured plans, the Nazis hurled troops into\r\nSoviet territory without any declaration of war. The entire European\r\nworld was aflame.\r\n\r\n                         CONSPIRACY WITH JAPAN\r\n\r\nThe Nazi plans of aggression called for use of Asiatic allies and they\r\nfound among the Japanese men of kindred mind and purpose. They were\r\nbrothers, under the skin.\r\n\r\nHimmler records a conversation he had on January 31, 1939 with General\r\nOshima, Japanese Ambassador at Berlin. He wrote:\r\n\r\n    “Furthermore, he (Oshima) had succeeded up to now to send 10\r\n    Russians with bombs across the Caucasian frontier. These\r\n    Russians had the mission to kill Stalin. A number of additional\r\n    Russians, whom he had also sent across, had been shot at the\r\n    frontier.” (_2195-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn September 27th, 1940, the Nazis concluded a German-Italian-Japanese\r\nten-year military and economic alliance by which those powers agreed “to\r\nstand by and cooperate with one another in regard to their efforts in\r\nGreater East Asia and regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their\r\nprime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things * * *.”\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1941, a top secret directive was issued by defendant Keitel.\r\nIt stated that “The Fuehrer has ordered instigation of Japan’s active\r\nparticipation in the war” and directed that “Japan’s military power has\r\nto be strengthened by the disclosure of German war experiences and\r\nsupport of a military, economic and technical nature has to be given.”\r\nThe aim was stated to be to crush England quickly, “thereby keeping the\r\nUnited States out of the war.” (_C-75_).\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 1941, Ribbentrop told Matsuoka, the Japanese Foreign\r\nMinister, that the German Army was ready to strike against Russia.\r\nMatsuoka reassured Ribbentrop about the Far East. Japan, he reported,\r\nwas acting at the moment as though she had no interest whatever in\r\nSingapore, but “intends to strike when the right moment comes.”\r\n(_1877-PS_). On April 5, 1941, Ribbentrop urged Matsuoka that entry of\r\nJapan into the war would “hasten the victory” and would be more in the\r\ninterest of Japan that of Germany since it would give Japan a unique\r\nchance to fulfill her national aims and to play a leading part in\r\nEastern Asia (_1882-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe proofs in this case will also show that the leaders of Germany were\r\nplanning war against the United States from its Atlantic as well as\r\ninstigating it from its Pacific approaches. A captured memorandum from\r\nthe Fuehrer’s headquarters, dated October 29, 1940, asks certain\r\ninformation as to air bases and supply and reports further that\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer is at present occupied with the question of the\r\n    occupation of the Atlantic islands with a view to the\r\n    prosecution of war against America at a later date.\r\n    Deliberations on this subject are being embarked upon here.”\r\n    (_376-PS_).\r\n\r\nOn December 7, 1941, a day which the late President Roosevelt declared\r\n“will live in infamy,” victory for German aggression seemed certain. The\r\nWehrmacht was at the gates of Moscow. Taking advantage of the situation,\r\nand while her plenipotentiaries were creating a diplomatic diversion in\r\nWashington, Japan without declaration of war treacherously attacked the\r\nUnited States at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines. Attacks followed\r\nswiftly on the British Commonwealth and The Netherlands in the Southwest\r\nPacific. These aggressions were met in the only way they could be met,\r\nwith instant declarations of war and with armed resistance which mounted\r\nslowly through many long months of reverse until finally the Axis was\r\ncrushed to earth and deliverance for its victims was won.\r\n\r\n                      CRIMES IN THE CONDUCT OF WAR\r\n\r\nEven the most warlike of peoples have recognized in the name of humanity\r\nsome limitations on the savagery of warfare. Rules to that end have been\r\nembodied in international conventions to which Germany became a party.\r\nThis code had prescribed certain restraints as to the treatment of\r\nbelligerents. The enemy was entitled to surrender and to receive quarter\r\nand good treatment as a prisoner of war. We will show by German\r\ndocuments that these rights were denied, that prisoners of war were\r\ngiven brutal treatment and often murdered. This was particularly true in\r\nthe case of captured airmen, often my countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that captured English and American airmen should no\r\nlonger be granted the status of prisoners of war. They were to be\r\ntreated as criminals and the Army was ordered to refrain from protecting\r\nthem against lynching by the populace (_R-118_). The Nazi Government,\r\nthrough its police and propaganda agencies, took pains to incite the\r\ncivilian population to attack and kill airmen who crash-landed. The\r\norder, given by the Reichsfuehrer SS, Himmler, on 10 August 1943,\r\ndirected that,\r\n\r\n    “It is not the task of the police to interfere in clashes\r\n    between German and English and American fliers who have bailed\r\n    out.”\r\n\r\nThis order was transmitted on the same day by SS Obersturmbannfuhrer\r\nBrand of Himmler’s Personal Staff to all Senior Executive SS and Police\r\nofficers, with these directions:\r\n\r\n    “I am sending you the inclosed order with the request that the\r\n    Chief of the Regular Police and of the Security Police be\r\n    informed. They are to make this instruction known to their\r\n    subordinate officers verbally.” (_R-110_).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we will show Hitler’s top secret order, dated 18 October\r\n1942, that commandos, regardless of condition, were “to be slaughtered\r\nto the last man” after capture (_498-PS_). We will show the circulation\r\nof secret orders, one of which was signed by Hess, to be passed orally\r\nto civilians, that enemy fliers or parachutists were to be arrested or\r\nliquidated (_062-PS_). By such means were murders incited and directed.\r\n\r\nThis Nazi campaign of ruthless treatment of enemy forces assumed its\r\ngreatest proportions in the fight against Russia. Eventually all\r\nprisoners of war were taken out of control of the Army and put in the\r\nhands of Himmler and the SS (_058-PS_). In the East, the German fury\r\nspent itself. Russian prisoners were ordered to be branded. They were\r\nstarved. I shall quote passages from a letter written February 28, 1942\r\nby defendant Rosenberg to defendant Keitel:\r\n\r\n    “The fate of the Soviet prisoners of war in Germany is on the\r\n    contrary a tragedy of the greatest extent. Of 3.6 millions of\r\n    prisoners of war, only several hundred thousand are still able\r\n    to work fully. A large part of them has starved, or died,\r\n    because of the hazards of the weather. Thousands also died from\r\n    spotted fever.\r\n\r\n    “The camp commanders have forbidden the civilian population to\r\n    put food at the disposal of the prisoners, and they have rather\r\n    let them starve to death.\r\n\r\n    “In many cases, when prisoners of war could no longer keep up on\r\n    the march because of hunger and exhaustion, they were shot\r\n    before the eyes of the horrified civilian population, and the\r\n    corpses were left.\r\n\r\n    “In numerous camps, no shelter for the prisoners of war was\r\n    provided at all. They lay under the open sky during rain or\r\n    snow. Even tools were not made available to dig holes or caves.\r\n\r\n    “Finally, the shooting of prisoners of war must be mentioned.\r\n    For instance, in various camps, all the ‘Asiatics’ were shot.”\r\n    (_081-PS_).\r\n\r\nCivilized usage and conventions to which Germany was a party had\r\nprescribed certain immunities for civilian populations unfortunate\r\nenough to dwell in lands overrun by hostile armies. The German\r\noccupation forces, controlled or commanded by men on trial before you,\r\ncommitted a long series of outrages against the inhabitants of occupied\r\nterritory that would be incredible except for captured orders and the\r\ncaptured reports showing the fidelity with which these orders were\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nWe deal here with a phase of common criminality designed by the\r\nconspirators as part of the common plan. We can appreciate why these\r\ncrimes against their European enemies were not of a casual character but\r\nwere planned and disciplined crimes when we get at the reason for them.\r\nHitler told his officers on August 22, 1939 that “The main objective in\r\nPoland is the destruction of the enemy and not the reaching of a certain\r\ngeographical line.” (_1014-PS_). The project of deporting promising\r\nyouth from occupied territories was approved by Rosenberg on the theory\r\nthat “a desired weakening of the biological force of the conquered\r\npeople is being achieved.” (_031-PS_). To Germanize or to destroy was\r\nthe program. Himmler announced, “Either we win over any good blood that\r\nwe can use for ourselves and give it a place in our people or,\r\ngentlemen—you may call this cruel, but nature is cruel—we destroy this\r\nblood.” As to “racially good types” Himmler further advised, “Therefore,\r\nI think that it is our duty to take their children with us to remove\r\nthem from their environment if necessary by robbing or stealing them.”\r\n(_L-70_). He urged deportation of Slavic children to deprive potential\r\nenemies of future soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi purpose was to leave Germany’s neighbors so weakened that even\r\nif she should eventually lose the war, she would still be the most\r\npowerful nation in Europe. Against this background, we must view the\r\nplan for ruthless warfare, which means a plan for the commission of war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity.\r\n\r\nHostages in large numbers were demanded and killed. Mass punishments\r\nwere inflicted, so savage that whole communities were extinguished.\r\nRosenberg was advised of the annihilation of three unidentified villages\r\nin Slovakia. In May of 1943, another village of about 40 farms and 220\r\ninhabitants was ordered wiped out. The entire population was ordered\r\nshot, the cattle and property impounded, and the order required that\r\n“the village will be destroyed totally by fire.” A secret report from\r\nRosenberg’s Reich Ministry of Eastern territory reveals that:\r\n\r\n    “Food rations allowed the Russian population are so low that\r\n    they fail to secure their existence and provide only for minimum\r\n    subsistence of limited duration. The population, does not know\r\n    if they will still live tomorrow. They are faced with death by\r\n    starvation.\r\n\r\n    “The roads are clogged by hundreds of thousands of people,\r\n    sometime as many as one million according to the estimate of\r\n    experts, who wander around in search of nourishment.\r\n\r\n    “Sauckel’s action has caused great unrest among the civilians.\r\n    Russian girls were deloused by men, nude photos in forced\r\n    positions were taken, women doctors were locked into freight\r\n    cars for the pleasure of the transport commanders, women in\r\n    night shirts were fettered and forced through the Russian towns\r\n    to the railroad station, etc. All this material has been sent to\r\n    the OKH.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the deportation to slave labor was the most horrible and\r\nextensive slaving operation in history. On few other subjects is our\r\nevidence so abundant or so damaging. In a speech made on January 25,\r\n1944, the defendant Frank, Governor-General of Poland, boasted, “I have\r\nsent 1,300,000 Polish workers into the Reich.” The defendant Sauckel\r\nreported that “out of the five million foreign workers who arrived in\r\nGermany not even 200,000 came voluntarily.” This fact was reported to\r\nthe Fuehrer and defendants Speer, Goering, and Keitel (_R-124_).\r\nChildren of 10 to 14 years were impressed into service by telegraphic\r\norder of Rosenberg’s Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories:\r\n\r\n    “The Command is further charged with the transferring of\r\n    worthwhile Russian youth between 10-14 years of age, to the\r\n    Reich. The authority is not affected by the changes connected\r\n    with the evacuation and transportation to the reception camps of\r\n    Pialystok, Krajewo, and Olitei. The Fuehrer wishes that this\r\n    activity be increased even more.” (_200-PS_).\r\n\r\nWhen enough labor was not forthcoming, prisoners of war were forced in\r\nwar work in flagrant violation of international conventions (_016-PS_).\r\nSlave labor came from France, Belgium, Holland, Italy, and the East.\r\nMethods of recruitment were violent (_R-124, 018-PS, 204-PS_). The\r\ntreatment of these slave laborers was stated in general terms, not\r\ndifficult to translate into concrete deprivations, in a letter to the\r\ndefendant Rosenberg from the defendant Sauckel, which stated:\r\n\r\n    “All _prisoners of war_, from the _territories_ of the West as\r\n    well of the East, actually in Germany, must be completely\r\n    incorporated into the German armament and munition industries.\r\n    Their production must be brought to the highest possible level.\r\n\r\n    “The complete employment of all prisoners of war as well as the\r\n    use of a gigantic number of new foreign civilian workers, men\r\n    and women, has become an undisputable necessity for the solution\r\n    of the mobilization of labor program in this war.\r\n\r\n    “All the men must be fed, sheltered and treated in such a way as\r\n    to exploit them to the highest possible extent at the lowest\r\n    conceivable degrees of expenditure.” (_016-PS_).\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the Nazi plan permanently to reduce the living standards\r\nof their neighbors and to weaken them physically and economically, a\r\nlong series of crimes were committed. There was extensive destruction,\r\nserving no military purpose, of the property of civilians. Dikes were\r\nthrown open in Holland almost at the close of the war not to achieve\r\nmilitary ends but to destroy the resources and retard the economy of the\r\nthrifty Netherlanders.\r\n\r\nThere was carefully planned economic syphoning off of the assets of\r\noccupied countries. An example of the planning is shown by a report on\r\nFrance dated December 7, 1942 made by the Economic Research Department\r\nof the Reichsbank. The question arose whether French occupation costs\r\nshould be increased from 15 million Reichsmarks per day to 25 million\r\nReichsmarks per day. The Reichsbank analyzed French economy to determine\r\nwhether it could bear the burden. It pointed out that the armistice had\r\nburdened France to that date to the extent of 18½ billion Reichsmarks,\r\nequalling 370 billion Francs. It pointed out that the burden of these\r\npayments within two and a half years equalled the aggregate French\r\nnational income in the year 1940, and that the amount of payments handed\r\nover to Germany in the first six months of 1942 corresponded to the\r\nestimate for the total French revenue for that whole year. The report\r\nconcluded, “In any case, the conclusion is inescapable that relatively\r\nheavier tributes have been imposed on France since the armistice in\r\nJune, 1940 than upon Germany after the World War. In this connection, it\r\nmust be noted that the economic powers of France never equalled those of\r\nthe German Reich and that vanquished France could not draw on foreign\r\neconomic and financial resources in the same degree as Germany after the\r\nlast World War.”\r\n\r\nThe defendant Funk was the Reichs Minister of Economics and President of\r\nthe Reichsbank; the defendant Ribbentrop was Foreign Minister; the\r\ndefendant Goering was Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, and all of\r\nthem participated in the exchange of views of which this captured\r\ndocument is a part (_2149-PS_). Notwithstanding this analysis by the\r\nReichsbank, they proceeded to increase the imposition on France from 15\r\nmillion Reichsmarks daily to 25 million daily.\r\n\r\nIt is small wonder that the bottom has been knocked out of French\r\neconomy. The plan and purpose of the thing appears in a letter from\r\nGeneral Stulpnagle, head of the German Armistice Commission, to the\r\ndefendant Jodl as early as 14th September, 1940 when he wrote, “The\r\nslogan ‘Systematic weakening of France’ has already been surpassed by\r\nfar in reality.”\r\n\r\nNot only was there a purpose to debilitate and demoralize the economy of\r\nGermany’s neighbors for the purpose of destroying their competitive\r\nposition, but there was looting and pilfering on an unprecedented scale.\r\nWe need not be hypocritical about this business of looting. I recognize\r\nthat no army moves through occupied territory without some pilfering as\r\nit goes. Usually the amount of pilfering increases as discipline wanes.\r\nIf the evidence in this case showed no looting except of that sort, I\r\ncertainly would ask no conviction of these defendants for it.\r\n\r\nBut we will show you that looting was not due to the lack of discipline\r\nor to the ordinary weaknesses of human nature. The German organized\r\nplundering, planned it, disciplined it, and made it official just as he\r\norganized everything else, and then he compiled the most meticulous\r\nrecords to show that he had done the best job of looting that was\r\npossible under the circumstances. And we have those records.\r\n\r\nThe defendant Rosenberg was put in charge of a systematic plundering of\r\nthe art objects of Europe by direct order of Hitler dated 29 January\r\n1940 (_136-PS_). On the 16th of April, 1943 Rosenberg reported that up\r\nto the 7th of April, 92 railway cars with 2,775 cases containing art\r\nobjects had been sent to Germany; and that 53 pieces of art had been\r\nshipped to Hitler direct, and 594 to the defendant Goering. The report\r\nmentioned something like 20,000 pieces of seized art and the main\r\nlocations where they were stored (_015-PS_).\r\n\r\nMoreover, this looting was glorified by Rosenberg. Here we have 39\r\nleather-bound tabulated volumes of his inventory, which in due time we\r\nwill offer in evidence. One cannot but admire the artistry of this\r\nRosenberg report. The Nazi taste was cosmopolitan. Of the 9,455 articles\r\ninventoried, there were included 5,255 paintings, 297 sculptures, 1,372\r\npieces of antique furniture, 307 textiles, and 2,224 small objects of\r\nart. Rosenberg observed that there were approximately 10,000 more\r\nobjects still to be inventoried (_015-PS_). Rosenberg himself estimated\r\nthat the values involved would come close to a billion dollars\r\n(_090-PS_).\r\n\r\nI shall not go into further details of the war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity committed by the Nazi gangster ring whose leaders are before\r\nyou. It is not the purpose in my part of this case to deal with the\r\nindividual crimes. I am dealing with the common plan or design for crime\r\nand will not dwell upon individual offenses. My task is only to show the\r\nscale on which these crimes occurred, and to show that these are the men\r\nwho were in the responsible positions and who conceived the plan and\r\ndesign which renders them answerable, regardless of the fact that the\r\nplan was actually executed by others.\r\n\r\nAt length, this reckless and lawless course outraged the world. It\r\nrecovered from the demoralization of surprise attack, assembled its\r\nforces, and stopped these men in their tracks. Once success deserted\r\ntheir banners, one by one the Nazi satellites fell away. Sawdust Caesar\r\ncollapsed. Resistance forces in every occupied country arose to harry\r\nthe invader. Even at home, Germans saw that Germany was being led to\r\nruin by these mad men, and the attempt on July 20, 1944 to assassinate\r\nHitler, an attempt fostered by men of highest station, was a desperate\r\neffort by internal forces to stop short of ruin. Quarrels broke out\r\namong the failing conspirators, and the decline of the Nazi power was\r\nmore swift than its ascendancy. German armed forces surrendered, its\r\ngovernment disintegrated, its leaders committed suicide by the dozen,\r\nand by the fortunes of war these defendants fell into our hands.\r\nAlthough they are not by any means all the guilty ones, they are\r\nsurvivors among the most responsible. Their names appear over and over\r\nin the documents and their faces grace the photographic evidence. We\r\nhave here the surviving top politicians, militarists, financiers,\r\ndiplomats, administrators, and propagandists of the Nazi movement. Who\r\nwas responsible for these crimes if they were not?\r\n\r\n                          THE LAW OF THE CASE\r\n\r\nThe end of the war and capture of these prisoners presented the\r\nvictorious Allies with the question whether there is any legal\r\nresponsibility on high-ranking men for acts which I have described. Must\r\nsuch wrongs either be ignored or redressed in hot blood? Is there no\r\nstandard in the law for a deliberate and reasoned judgment on such\r\nconduct?\r\n\r\nThe Charter of this Tribunal evidences a faith that the law is not only\r\nto govern the conduct of little men, but that even rulers are, as Lord\r\nChief Justice Coke put it to King James, “under God and the law.” The\r\nUnited States believed that the law long has afforded standards by which\r\na juridical hearing could be conducted to make sure that we punish only\r\nthe right men and for the right reasons. Following the instructions of\r\nthe late President Roosevelt and the decision of the Yalta conference,\r\nPresident Truman directed representatives of the United States to\r\nformulate a proposed International Agreement, which was submitted during\r\nthe San Francisco Conference to Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom,\r\nthe Soviet Union, and the Provisional Government of France. With many\r\nmodifications, that proposal has become the Charter of this Tribunal.\r\n\r\nBut the Agreement which sets up the standards by which these prisoners\r\nare to be judged does not express the views of the signatory nations\r\nalone. Other nations with diverse but highly respected systems of\r\njurisprudence also have signified adherence to it. These are Belgium,\r\nThe Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, Poland,\r\nGreece, Yugoslavia, Ethiopia, Australia, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, New\r\nZealand, Venezuela, and India. You judge, therefore, under an organic\r\nact which represents the wisdom, the sense of justice, and the will of\r\ntwenty-one governments, representing an overwhelming majority of all\r\ncivilized people.\r\n\r\nThe Charter by which this Tribunal has its being embodies certain legal\r\nconcepts which are inseparable from its jurisdiction and which must\r\ngovern its decision. These, as I have said, also are conditions attached\r\nto the grant of any hearing to defendants. The validity of the\r\nprovisions of the Charter is conclusive upon us all whether we have\r\naccepted the duty of judging or of prosecuting under it, as well as upon\r\nthe defendants, who can point to no other law which gives them a right\r\nto be heard at all. My able and experienced colleagues believe, as do I,\r\nthat it will contribute to the expedition and clarity of this trial if I\r\nexpound briefly the application of the legal philosophy of the Charter\r\nto the facts I have recited.\r\n\r\nWhile this declaration of the law by the Charter is final, it may be\r\ncontended that the prisoners on trial are entitled to have it applied to\r\ntheir conduct only most charitably if at all. It may be said that this\r\nis new law, not authoritatively declared at the time they did the acts\r\nit condemns, and that this declaration of the law has taken them by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nI cannot, of course, deny that these men are surprised that this is the\r\nlaw; they really are surprised that there is any such thing as law.\r\nThese defendants did not rely on any law at all. Their program ignored\r\nand defied all law. That this is so will appear from many acts and\r\nstatements, of which I cite but a few. In the Fuehrer’s speech to all\r\nmilitary commanders on November 23, 1939, he reminded them that at the\r\nmoment Germany had a pact with Russia, but declared, “Agreements are to\r\nbe kept only as long as they serve a certain purpose.” Later on in the\r\nsame speech he announced, “A violation of the neutrality of Holland and\r\nBelgium will be of no importance.” (_789-PS_). A Top Secret document,\r\nentitled “Warfare as a Problem of Organization,” dispatched by the Chief\r\nof the High Command to all Commanders on April 19, 1938, declared that\r\n“the normal rules of war toward neutrals may be considered to apply on\r\nthe basis whether operation of rules will create greater advantages or\r\ndisadvantages for belligerents.” (_L-211_). And from the files of the\r\nGerman Navy Staff, we have a “Memorandum on Intensified Naval War,”\r\ndated October 15, 1939, which begins by stating a desire to comply with\r\nInternational Law. “However,” it continues, “if decisive successes are\r\nexpected from any measure considered as a war necessity, it must be\r\ncarried through even if it is not in agreement with international law.”\r\n(_UK-65_). International Law, natural law, German law, any law at all\r\nwas to these men simply a propaganda device to be invoked when it helped\r\nand to be ignored when it would condemn what they wanted to do. That men\r\nmay be protected in relying upon the law at the time they act is the\r\nreason we find laws of retrospective operation unjust. But these men\r\ncannot bring themselves within the reason of the rule which in some\r\nsystems of jurisprudence prohibits _ex post facto_ laws. They cannot\r\nshow that they ever relied upon International Law in any state or paid\r\nit the slightest regard.\r\n\r\nThe Third Count of the Indictment is based on the definition of war\r\ncrimes contained in the Charter. I have outlined to you the systematic\r\ncourse of conduct toward civilian populations and combat forces which\r\nviolates international conventions to which Germany was a party. Of the\r\ncriminal nature of these acts at least, the defendants had, as we shall\r\nshow, clear knowledge. Accordingly, they took pains to conceal their\r\nviolations. It will appear that the defendants Keitel and Jodl were\r\ninformed by official legal advisors that the orders to brand Russian\r\nprisoners of war, to shackle British prisoners of war, and to execute\r\ncommando prisoners were clear violations of International Law.\r\nNevertheless, these orders were put into effect. The same is true of\r\norders issued for the assassination of General Giraud and General\r\nWeygand, which failed to be executed only because of a ruse on the part\r\nof Admiral Canaris, who was himself later executed for his part in the\r\nplot to take Hitler’s life on July 20, 1944 (_Affidavit A_).\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Count of the Indictment is based on crimes against humanity.\r\nChief among these are mass killings of countless human beings in cold\r\nblood. Does it take these men by surprise that murder is treated as a\r\ncrime?\r\n\r\nThe First and Second Counts of the Indictment add to these crimes the\r\ncrime of plotting and waging wars of aggression and wars in violation of\r\nnine treaties to which Germany was a party. There was a time, in fact I\r\nthink the time of the first World War, when it could not have been said\r\nthat war-inciting or war-making was a crime in law, however\r\nreprehensible in morals.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was under the law of all civilized peoples a crime for one\r\nman with his bare knuckles to assault another. How did it come that\r\nmultiplying this crime by a million, and adding fire arms to bare\r\nknuckles, made a legally innocent act? The doctrine was that one could\r\nnot be regarded as criminal for committing the usual violent acts in the\r\nconduct of legitimate warfare. The age of imperialistic expansion during\r\nthe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries added the foul doctrine,\r\ncontrary to the teachings of early Christian and International Law\r\nscholars such as Grotius, that all wars are to be regarded as legitimate\r\nwars. The sum of these two doctrines was to give war-making a complete\r\nimmunity from accountability to law.\r\n\r\nThis was intolerable for an age that called itself civilized. Plain\r\npeople, with their earthly common sense, revolted at such fictions and\r\nlegalisms so contrary to ethical principles and demanded checks on war\r\nimmunity. Statesmen and international lawyers at first cautiously\r\nresponded by adopting rules of warfare designed to make the conduct of\r\nwar more civilized. The effort was to set legal limits to the violence\r\nthat could be done to civilian populations and to combatants as well.\r\n\r\nThe common sense of men after the First World War demanded, however,\r\nthat the law’s condemnation of war reach deeper, and that the law\r\ncondemn not merely uncivilized ways of waging war, but also the waging\r\nin any way of uncivilized wars—wars of aggression. The world’s\r\nstatesmen again went only as far as they were forced to go. Their\r\nefforts were timid and cautious and often less explicit than we might\r\nhave hoped. But the 1920’s did outlaw aggressive war.\r\n\r\nThe reestablishment of the principle that there are unjust wars and that\r\nunjust wars are illegal is traceable in many steps. One of the most\r\nsignificant is the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928, by which Germany, Italy,\r\nand Japan, in common with practically all the nations of the world,\r\nrenounced war as an instrument of national policy, bound themselves to\r\nseek the settlement of disputes only by pacific means, and condemned\r\nrecourse to war for the solution of international controversies. This\r\npact altered the legal status of a war of aggression. As Mr. Stimson,\r\nthe United States Secretary of State put it in 1932, such a war “is no\r\nlonger to be the source and subject of rights. It is no longer to be the\r\nprinciple around which the duties, the conduct, and the rights of\r\nnations revolve. It is an illegal thing. * * * By that very act, we have\r\nmade obsolete many legal precedents and have given the legal profession\r\nthe task of reexamining many of its codes and treaties.”\r\n\r\nThe Geneva Protocol of 1924 for the Pacific Settlement of International\r\nDisputes, signed by the representatives of forty-eight governments,\r\ndeclared that “a war of aggression constitutes * * * an international\r\ncrime.” The Eighth Assembly of the League of Nations in 1927, on\r\nunanimous resolution of the representatives of forty-eight member\r\nnations, including Germany, declared that a war of aggression\r\nconstitutes an international crime. At the Sixth Pan-American Conference\r\nof 1928, the twenty-one American Republics unanimously adopted a\r\nresolution stating that “war of aggression constitutes an international\r\ncrime against the human species.”\r\n\r\nA failure of these Nazis to heed, or to understand the force and meaning\r\nof this evolution in the legal thought of the world is not a defense or\r\na mitigation. If anything, it aggravates their offense and makes it the\r\nmore mandatory that the law they have flouted be vindicated by juridical\r\napplication to their lawless conduct. Indeed, by their own law—had they\r\nheeded any law—these principles were binding on these defendants.\r\nArticle 4 of the Weimar Constitution provided that “The generally\r\naccepted rules of international law are to be considered as binding\r\nintegral parts of the law of the German Reich.” (_2050-PS_). Can there\r\nbe any doubt that the outlawry of aggressive war was one of the\r\n“generally accepted rules of international law” in 1939?\r\n\r\nAny resort to war—to any kind of a war—is a resort to means that are\r\ninherently criminal. War inevitably is a course of killings, assaults,\r\ndeprivations of liberty, and destruction of property. An honestly\r\ndefensive war is, of course, legal and saves those lawfully conducting\r\nit from criminality. But inherently criminal acts cannot be defended by\r\nshowing that those who committed them were engaged in a war, when war\r\nitself is illegal. The very minimum legal consequence of the treaties\r\nmaking aggressive wars illegal is to strip those who incite or wage them\r\nof every defense the law ever gave, and to leave warmakers subject to\r\njudgment by the usually accepted principles of the law of crimes.\r\n\r\nBut if it be thought that the Charter, whose declarations concededly\r\nbind us all, does contain new law I still do not shrink from demanding\r\nits strict application by this Tribunal. The rule of law in the world,\r\nflouted by the lawlessness incited by these defendants, had to be\r\nrestored at the cost to my country of over a million casualties, not to\r\nmention those of other nations. I cannot subscribe to the perverted\r\nreasoning that society may advance and strengthen the rule of law by the\r\nexpenditure of morally innocent lives but that progress in the law may\r\nnever be made at the price of morally guilty lives.\r\n\r\nIt is true, of course, that we have no judicial precedent for the\r\nCharter. But International Law is more than a scholarly collection of\r\nabstract and immutable principles. It is an outgrowth of treaties and\r\nagreements between nations and of accepted customs. Yet every custom has\r\nits origin in some single act, and every agreement has to be initiated\r\nby the action of some state. Unless we are prepared to abandon every\r\nprinciple of growth for International Law, we cannot deny that our own\r\nday has the right to institute customs and to conclude agreements that\r\nwill themselves become sources of a newer and strengthened International\r\nLaw. International Law is not capable of development by the normal\r\nprocesses of legislation for there is no continuing international\r\nlegislative authority. Innovations and revisions in International Law\r\nare brought about by the action of governments designed to meet a change\r\nin circumstances. It grows, as did the Common Law, through decisions\r\nreached from time to time in adapting settled principles to new\r\nsituations. The fact is that when the law evolves by the case method, as\r\ndid the Common Law and as International Law must do if it is to advance\r\nat all, it advances at the expense of those who wrongly guessed the law\r\nand learned too late their error. The law, so far as International Law\r\ncan be decreed, had been clearly pronounced when these acts took place.\r\nHence, I am not disturbed by the lack of judicial precedent for the\r\ninquiry we propose to conduct.\r\n\r\nThe events I have earlier recited clearly fall within the standards of\r\ncrimes, set out in the Charter, whose perpetrators this Tribunal is\r\nconvened to judge and punish fittingly. The standards for war crimes and\r\ncrimes against humanity are too familiar to need comment. There are,\r\nhowever, certain novel problems in applying other precepts of the\r\nCharter which I should call to your attention.\r\n\r\n                        THE CRIME AGAINST PEACE\r\n\r\nA basic provision of the Charter is that to plan, prepare, initiate, or\r\nwage a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international\r\ntreaties, agreements, and assurances, or to conspire or participate in a\r\ncommon plan to do so is a crime.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a weakness in this Charter that it fails itself to define\r\na war of aggression. Abstractly, the subject is full of difficulty and\r\nall kinds of troublesome hypothetical cases can be conjured up. It is a\r\nsubject which, if the defense should be permitted to go afield beyond\r\nthe very narrow charge in the Indictment, would prolong the trial and\r\ninvolve the Tribunal in insoluble political issues. But so far as the\r\nquestion can properly be involved in this case, the issue is one of no\r\nnovelty and is one on which legal opinion has well crystalized.\r\n\r\nOne of the most authoritative sources of International Law on this\r\nsubject is the Convention for the Definition of Aggression signed at\r\nLondon on July 3, 1933 by Rumania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Turkey, The\r\nSoviet Union, Persia, and Afghanistan. The subject has also been\r\nconsidered by international committees and by commentators whose views\r\nare entitled to the greatest respect. It had been little discussed prior\r\nto the First World War but has received much attention as International\r\nLaw has evolved its outlawry of aggressive war. In the light of these\r\nmaterials of International Law, and so far as relevant to the evidence\r\nin this case, I suggest that an “aggressor” is generally held to be that\r\nstate which is the first to commit any of the following actions:\r\n\r\n    (1) Declaration of war upon another State;\r\n\r\n    (2) Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration\r\n    war, of the territory of another State;\r\n\r\n    (3) Attack by its land, naval, or air forces, with or without a\r\n    declaration of war, on the territory, vessels, or aircraft of\r\n    another State;\r\n\r\n    (4) Provision of support to armed bands formed in the territory\r\n    of another State, or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the\r\n    invaded State, to take in its own territory, all the measures in\r\n    its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or\r\n    protection.\r\n\r\nAnd I further suggest that it is the general view that no political,\r\nmilitary, economic or other considerations shall serve as an excuse or\r\njustification for such actions; but exercise of the right of legitimate\r\nself-defense, that is to say, resistance to an act of aggression, or\r\naction to assist a State which has been subjected to aggression, shall\r\nnot constitute a war of aggression.\r\n\r\nIt is upon such an understanding of the law that our evidence of a\r\nconspiracy to provoke and wage an aggressive war is prepared and\r\npresented. By this test each of the series of wars begun by these Nazi\r\nleaders was unambiguously aggressive.\r\n\r\nIt is important to the duration and scope of this trial that we bear in\r\nmind the difference between our charge that this war was one of\r\naggression and a position that Germany had no grievances. We are not\r\ninquiring into the conditions which contributed to causing this war.\r\nThey are for history to unravel. It is no part of our task to vindicate\r\nthe European _status quo_ as of 1933, or as of any other date. The\r\nUnited States does not desire to enter into discussion of the\r\ncomplicated pre-war currents of European politics, and it hopes this\r\ntrial will not be protracted by their consideration. The remote\r\ncausations avowed are too insincere and inconsistent, too complicated\r\nand doctrinaire to be the subject of profitable inquiry in this trial. A\r\nfamiliar example is to be found in the _Lebensraum_ slogan, which\r\nsummarized the contention that Germany needed more living space as a\r\njustification for expansion. At the same time that the Nazis were\r\ndemanding more space for the German people, they were demanding more\r\nGerman people to occupy space. Every known means to increase the birth\r\nrate, legitimate and illegitimate, was utilized. _Lebensraum_\r\nrepresented a vicious circle of demand—from neighbors more space, and\r\nfrom Germans more progeny. We do not need to investigate the verity of\r\ndoctrines which led to constantly expanding circles of aggression. It is\r\nthe plot and the act of aggression which we charge to be crimes.\r\n\r\nOur position is that whatever grievances a nation may have, however\r\nobjectionable it finds the _status quo_, aggressive warfare is an\r\nillegal means for settling those grievances or for altering those\r\nconditions. It may be that the Germany of the 1920’s and 1930’s faced\r\ndesperate problems, problems that would have warranted the boldest\r\nmeasures short of war. All other methods—persuasion, propaganda,\r\neconomic competition, diplomacy—were open to an aggrieved country, but\r\naggressive warfare was outlawed. These defendants did make aggressive\r\nwar, a war in violation of treaties. They did attack and invade their\r\nneighbors in order to effectuate a foreign policy which they knew could\r\nnot be accomplished by measures short of war. And that is as far as we\r\naccuse or propose to inquire.\r\n\r\n                  THE LAW OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\nThe Charter also recognizes individual responsibility on the part of\r\nthose who commit acts defined as crimes, or who incite others to do so,\r\nor who join a common plan with other persons, groups or organizations to\r\nbring about their commission. The principle of individual responsibility\r\nfor piracy and brigandage, which have long been recognized as crimes\r\npunishable under International Law, is old and well established. That is\r\nwhat illegal warfare is. This principle of personal liability is a\r\nnecessary as well as logical one if International Law is to render real\r\nhelp to the maintenance of peace. An International Law which operates\r\nonly on states can be enforced only by war because the most practicable\r\nmethod of coercing a state is warfare. Those familiar with American\r\nhistory know that one of the compelling reasons for adoption of our\r\nConstitution was that the laws of the Confederation, which operated only\r\non constituent states, were found ineffective to maintain order among\r\nthem. The only answer to recalcitrance was impotence or war. Only\r\nsanctions which reach individuals can peacefully and effectively be\r\nenforced. Hence, the principle of the criminality of aggressive war is\r\nimplemented by the Charter with the principle of personal\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nOf course, the idea that a state, any more than a corporation, commits\r\ncrimes is a fiction. Crimes always are committed only by persons. While\r\nit is quite proper to employ the fiction of responsibility of a state or\r\ncorporation for the purpose of imposing a collective liability, it is\r\nquite intolerable to let such a legalism become the basis of personal\r\nimmunity.\r\n\r\nThe Charter recognizes that one who has committed criminal acts may not\r\ntake refuge in superior orders nor in the doctrine that his crimes were\r\nacts of states. These twin principles working together have heretofore\r\nresulted in immunity for practically everyone concerned in the really\r\ngreat crimes against peace and mankind. Those in lower ranks were\r\nprotected against liability by the orders of their superiors. The\r\nsuperiors were protected because their orders were called acts of state.\r\nUnder the Charter, no defense based on either of these doctrines can be\r\nentertained. Modern civilization puts unlimited weapons of destruction\r\nin the hands of men. It cannot tolerate so vast an area of legal\r\nirresponsibility.\r\n\r\nEven the German Military Code provides that:\r\n\r\n    “If the execution of a military order in the course of duty\r\n    violates the criminal law, then the superior officer giving the\r\n    order will bear the sole responsibility therefor. However, the\r\n    obeying subordinate will share the punishment of the\r\n    participant: (1) if he has exceeded the order given to him, or\r\n    (2) if it was within his knowledge that the order of his\r\n    superior officer concerned an act by which it was intended to\r\n    commit a civil or military crime or transgression.”\r\n    (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1926, No. 37, p. 278, Art. 47).\r\n\r\nOf course, we do not argue that the circumstances under which one\r\ncommits an act should be disregarded in judging its legal effect. A\r\nconscripted private on a firing squad cannot expect to hold an inquest\r\non the validity of the execution. The Charter implies common sense\r\nlimits to liability just as it places common sense limits upon immunity.\r\nBut none of these men before you acted in minor parts. Each of them was\r\nentrusted with broad discretion and exercised great power. Their\r\nresponsibility is correspondingly great and may not be shifted to that\r\nfictional being, “the State”, which can not be produced for trial, can\r\nnot testify, and can not be sentenced.\r\n\r\nThe Charter also recognized a vicarious liability, which responsibility\r\nis recognized by most modern systems of law, for acts committed by\r\nothers in carrying out a common plan or conspiracy to which a defendant\r\nhas become a party. I need not discuss the familiar principles of such\r\nliability. Every day in the courts of countries associated in this,\r\nprosecution, men are convicted for acts that they did not personally\r\ncommit but for which they were held responsible because of membership in\r\nillegal combinations or plans or conspiracies.\r\n\r\n           THE POLITICAL, POLICE, AND MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\nAccused before this Tribunal as criminal organizations are certain\r\npolitical and police organizations which the evidence will show to have\r\nbeen instruments of cohesion in planning and executing the crimes I have\r\ndetailed. Perhaps the worst of the movement were the Leadership Corps of\r\nthe NSDAP, the Schutzstaffeln or “SS”, and the Sturmabteilungen or “SA”,\r\nand the subsidiary formations which these include. These were the Nazi\r\nParty leadership, espionage, and policing groups. They were the real\r\ngovernment, above and outside of any law. Also accused as organizations\r\nare the Reich Cabinet and the Secret State Police or Gestapo, which were\r\nfixtures of the Government but animated solely by the Nazi Party.\r\n\r\nExcept for a late period when some compulsory recruiting was done in the\r\nSS, membership in all these militarized formations was voluntary. The\r\npolice organizations were recruited from ardent partisans who enlisted\r\nblindly to do the dirty work the leaders planned. The Reich Cabinet was\r\nthe governmental facade for Nazi Party Government and in its members\r\nlegal as well as actual responsibility was vested for the entire\r\nprogram. Collectively they were responsible for the program in general,\r\nindividually they were especially responsible for segments of it. The\r\nfinding which we ask you to make, that these are criminal organizations,\r\nwill subject members to punishment to be hereafter determined by\r\nappropriate tribunals, unless some personal defense—such as becoming a\r\nmember under threat to person, to family, or inducement by false\r\nrepresentation, or the like—be established. Every member will have a\r\nchance to be heard in the subsequent forum on his personal relation to\r\nthe organization, but your finding in this trial will conclusively\r\nestablish the criminal character of the organization as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe have also accused as criminal organizations the High Command and the\r\nGeneral Staff of the German Armed Forces. We recognize that to plan\r\nwarfare is the business of professional soldiers in every country. But\r\nit is one thing to plan strategic moves in the event war comes, and it\r\nis another thing to plot and intrigue to bring on that war. We will\r\nprove the leaders of the German General Staff and of the High Command to\r\nhave been guilty of just that. Military men are not before you because\r\nthey served their country. They are here because they mastered it, along\r\nwith these others, and drove it to war. They are not here because they\r\nlost the war but because they started it. Politicians may have thought\r\nof them as soldiers, but soldiers know they were politicians. We ask\r\nthat the General Staff and the High Command, as defined in the\r\nIndictment, be condemned as a criminal group whose existence and\r\ntradition constitute a standing menace to the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nThese individual defendants did not stand alone in crime and will not\r\nstand alone in punishment. Your verdict of “guilty” against these\r\norganizations will render _prima facie_ guilty, as nearly as we can\r\nlearn, thousands upon thousands of members now in custody of United\r\nStates forces and of other Armies.\r\n\r\n                  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS TRIBUNAL\r\n\r\nTo apply the sanctions of the law to those whose conduct is found\r\ncriminal by the standards I have outlined, is the responsibility\r\ncommitted to this Tribunal. It is the first court ever to undertake the\r\ndifficult task of overcoming the confusion of many tongues and the\r\nconflicting concepts of just procedure among divers systems of law, so\r\nas to reach a common judgment. The tasks of all of us are such as to\r\nmake heavy demands on patience and good will. Although the need for\r\nprompt action has admittedly resulted in imperfect work on the part of\r\nthe prosecution, four great nations bring you their hurriedly assembled\r\ncontributions of evidence. What remains undiscovered we can only guess.\r\nWe could, with witnesses’ testimony, prolong the recitals of crime for\r\nyears—but to what avail? We shall rest the case when we have offered\r\nwhat seems convincing and adequate proof of the crimes charged without\r\nunnecessary cumulation of evidence. We doubt very much whether it will\r\nbe seriously denied that the crimes I have outlined took place. The\r\neffort will undoubtedly be to mitigate or escape personal\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nAmong the nations which unite in accusing these defendants the United\r\nStates is perhaps in a position to be the most dispassionate, for,\r\nhaving sustained the least injury, it is perhaps the least animated by\r\nvengeance. Our American cities have not been bombed by day and night, by\r\nhumans and by robots. It is not our temples that have been laid in\r\nruins. Our countrymen have not had their homes destroyed over their\r\nheads. The menace of Nazi aggression, except to those in actual service,\r\nhas seemed less personal and immediate to us than to European peoples.\r\nBut while the United States is not first in rancor, it is not second in\r\ndetermination that the forces of law and order be made equal to the task\r\nof dealing with such international lawlessness as I have recited here.\r\n\r\nTwice in my lifetime, the United States has sent its young manhood\r\nacross the Atlantic, drained its resources, and burdened itself with\r\ndebt to help defeat Germany. But the real hope and faith that has\r\nsustained the American people in these great efforts was that victory\r\nfor ourselves and our Allies would lay the basis for an ordered\r\ninternational relationship in Europe and would end the centuries of\r\nstrife on this embattled continent.\r\n\r\nTwice we have held back in the early stages of European conflict in the\r\nbelief that it might be confined to a purely European affair. In the\r\nUnited States, we have tried to build an economy without armament, a\r\nsystem of government without militarism, and a society where men are not\r\nregimented for war. This purpose, we know now, can never be realized if\r\nthe world periodically is to be embroiled in war. The United States\r\ncannot, generation after generation, throw its youth or its resources\r\nonto the battlefields of Europe to redress the lack of balance between\r\nGermany’s strength and that of her enemies, and to keep the battles from\r\nour shores.\r\n\r\nThe American dream of a peace and plenty economy, as well as the hopes\r\nof other nations, can never be fulfilled if those nations are involved\r\nin a war every generation so vast and devastating as to crush the\r\ngeneration that fights and burden the generation that follows. But\r\nexperience has shown that wars are no longer local. All modern wars\r\nbecome world wars eventually. And none of the big nations at least can\r\nstay out. If we cannot stay out of wars, our only hope is to prevent\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nI am too well aware of the weaknesses of juridical action alone to\r\ncontend that in itself your decision under this Charter can prevent\r\nfuture wars. Judicial action always comes after the event. Wars are\r\nstarted only on the theory and in the confidence that they can be won.\r\nPersonal punishment, to be suffered only in the event the war is lost,\r\nwill probably not be a sufficient deterrent to prevent a war where the\r\nwarmakers feel the chances of defeat to be negligible.\r\n\r\nBut the ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars, which are inevitable in\r\na system of international lawlessness, is to make statesmen responsible\r\nto law. And let me make clear that while this law is first applied\r\nagainst German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a\r\nuseful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations,\r\nincluding those which sit here now in judgment. We are able to do away\r\nwith domestic tyranny and violence and aggression by those in power\r\nagainst the rights of their own people only when we make all men\r\nanswerable to the law. This trial represents mankind’s desperate effort\r\nto apply the discipline of the law to statesmen who have used their\r\npowers of state to attack the foundations of the world’s peace and to\r\ncommit aggressions against the rights of their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of this effort to do justice is not to be measured by\r\nconsidering the law or your judgment in isolation. This trial is part of\r\nthe great effort to make the peace more secure. One step in this\r\ndirection is the United Nations organization, which may take joint\r\npolitical action to prevent war if possible, and joint military action\r\nto insure that any nation which starts a war will lose it. This Charter\r\nand this trial, implementing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, constitute another\r\nstep in the same direction—juridical action of a kind to ensure that\r\nthose who start a war will pay for it personally.\r\n\r\nWhile the defendants and the prosecutors stand before you as\r\nindividuals, it is not the triumph of either group alone that is\r\ncommitted to your judgment. Above all personalities there are anonymous\r\nand impersonal forces whose conflict makes up much of human history. It\r\nis yours to throw the strength of the law back of either the one or the\r\nother of these forces for at least another generation. What are the real\r\nforces that are contending before you?\r\n\r\nNo charity can disguise the fact that the forces, which these defendants\r\nrepresent, the forces that would advantage and delight in their\r\nacquittal, are the darkest and most sinister forces in\r\nsociety—dictatorship and oppression, malevolence and passion,\r\nmilitarism and lawlessness. By their fruits we best know them. Their\r\nacts have bathed the world in blood and set civilization back a century.\r\nThey have subjected their European neighbors to every outrage and\r\ntorture, every spoliation and deprivation that insolence, cruelty, and\r\ngreed could inflict. They have brought the German people to the lowest\r\npitch of wretchedness, from which they can entertain no hope of early\r\ndeliverance. They have stirred hatreds and incited domestic violence on\r\nevery continent. These are the things that stand in the dock shoulder to\r\nshoulder with these prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe real complaining party at your bar is Civilization. In all our\r\ncountries it is still a struggling and imperfect thing. It does not\r\nplead that the United States, or any other country, has been blameless\r\nof the conditions which made the German people easy victims to the\r\nblandishments and intimidations of the Nazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nBut it points to the dreadful sequence of aggressions and crimes I have\r\nrecited, it points to the weariness of flesh, the exhaustion of\r\nresources, and the destruction of all that was beautiful or useful in so\r\nmuch of the world, and to greater potentialities for destruction in the\r\ndays to come. It is not necessary among the ruins of this ancient and\r\nbeautiful city, with untold members of its civilian inhabitants still\r\nburied in its rubble, to argue the proposition that to start or wage an\r\naggressive war has the moral qualities of the worst of crimes. The\r\nrefuge of the defendants can be only their hope that International Law\r\nwill lag so far behind the moral sense of mankind that conduct which is\r\ncrime in the moral sense must be regarded as innocent in law.\r\n\r\nCivilization asks whether law is so laggard as to be utterly helpless to\r\ndeal with crimes of this magnitude by criminals of this order of\r\nimportance. It does not expect that you can make war impossible. It does\r\nexpect that your juridical action will put the forces of International\r\nLaw, its precepts, its prohibitions and, most of all, its sanctions, on\r\nthe side of peace, so that men and women of good will in all countries\r\nmay have “leave to live by no man’s leave, underneath the law.”\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    [In most instances, documents referred to or quoted from have\r\n    been cited by number, even though some of them have not been\r\n    introduced in evidence as part of the American case. Where they\r\n    were not offered as evidence it was chiefly for the reason that\r\n    documents subsequently discovered covered the point more\r\n    adequately, and because the pressure of time required the\r\n    avoidance of cumulative evidence.\r\n\r\n    In some instances, no citations are given of documents quoted\r\n    from or referred to. These are documents which for a variety of\r\n    reasons were not introduced in evidence during the American\r\n    case. The length of some of them was disproportionate to the\r\n    value of their contents, and hence instead of full translations\r\n    only summaries were prepared in English. In some cases a\r\n    translation of the document referred to was made only for use in\r\n    the address and was not included in the evidence which it was\r\n    proposed to offer in court. In other cases the document,\r\n    although translated, was turned over to the French or Russian\r\n    delegations for use in the proof of Counts III and IV, and hence\r\n    forms no part of the American case.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter VI\r\n                ORGANIZATION OF THE NAZI PARTY AND STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n                           I. THE NAZI PARTY\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the prosecution, some preliminary references must be\r\nmade to the National Socialist German Labor Party, the NSDAP\r\n(_Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei_) which is not itself\r\none of the defendant organizations in this proceeding, but which is\r\nrepresented among the defendant organizations by its most important\r\nformations, viz., the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party (_Das Korps der\r\nPolitischen Leiter der NSDAP_), the SS (_Die Schutzstaffeln der NSDAP_),\r\nand the SA (_Die Sturmabteilungen der NSDAP_).\r\n\r\nThe prosecution has prepared a chart (_Chart No. 1_) showing the\r\nstructure and organization of the NSDAP substantially as it existed at\r\nthe peak of its development in March 1945. This chart has been prepared\r\non the basis of information contained in important publications of the\r\nNational Socialist Party, with which the defendants must be presumed to\r\nhave been well acquainted. Particular reference is made to the\r\nOrganization Book of the Party (_Das Organisationsbuch der NSDAP_) and\r\nto the National Socialist Year Book (_Nationalsozialistisches\r\nJahrbuch_), of both of which Robert Ley was publisher. Both books were\r\nprinted in many editions and appeared in hundreds of thousands of\r\ncopies, throughout the period when the National Socialist party was in\r\ncontrol of the German Reich and of the German people. This chart has\r\nbeen certified on its face as correct by a high official of the Nazi\r\nparty, viz. Franz Xaver Schwarz, its Treasurer (_Reichsschatzmeister der\r\nNSDAP_), and its official in charge of party administration, whose\r\naffidavit is submitted with the chart.\r\n\r\nCertain explanatory remarks concerning the organization of the National\r\nSocialist party may be useful.\r\n\r\nThe _Leadership Corps of the NSDAP_, named as a defendant organization,\r\ncomprised the sum of the officials of the Nazi party. It was divided\r\ninto seven categories:\r\n\r\n                      1. The Fuehrer\r\n                      2. Reichsleiter\r\n                    { 3. Gauleiter\r\n                    { 4. Kreisleiter\r\n   _Hoheitstraeger_ { 5. Ortsgruppenleiter\r\n                    { 6. Zellenleiter\r\n                    { 7. Blockleiter\r\n\r\nThe _Fuehrer_ was the supreme and only leader who stood at the top of\r\nthe party hierarchy. His successor designate was first, Hermann Goering,\r\nand second, Rudolf Hess.\r\n\r\nThe _Reichsleiter_, of whom 16 are shown on the chart, made up the Party\r\nDirectorate (_Reichsleitung_). Through them, coordination of party and\r\nstate machinery was assured. A number of these _Reichsleiter_, each of\r\nwhom, at some time, was in charge of at least one office within the\r\nParty Directorate, were also the heads of party formations and of\r\naffiliated or supervised organizations of the party, or of agencies of\r\nthe state, or even held ministerial positions. The _Reichsleitung_ may\r\nbe said to have represented the horizontal organization of the party\r\naccording to functions, within which all threads controlling the varied\r\nlife of the German people met. Each office within the _Reichsleitung_ of\r\nthe NSDAP executed definite tasks assigned to it by the Fuehrer, or by\r\nthe leader of the Party Chancellory (_Chef der Parteikanzlei_), who in\r\n1945 was Martin Bormann and before him, Rudolph Hess.\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the _Reichsleitung_ to make certain these tasks were\r\ncarried out so that the will of the Fuehrer was quickly communicated to\r\nthe lowliest _Zelle_ or _Block_. The individual offices of the\r\n_Reichsleitung_ had the mission to remain in constant and closest\r\ncontact with the life of the people through the subdivisions of the\r\nparty organization, in the _Gaue_, _Kreisen_, and _Ortsgruppen_. These\r\nleaders had been taught that the right to organize human beings accrued\r\nthrough appreciation of the fact that a people must be educated\r\nideologically (_weltanschaulich_), that is to say, according to the\r\nphilosophy of National Socialism. Among the former _Reichsleiter_ on\r\ntrial in this cause are the following defendants:\r\n\r\n    _Alfred Rosenberg_—The delegate to the Fuehrer for Ideological\r\n    Training and Education of the Party. (_Der Beauftragte des\r\n    Fuehrer’s fuer die Ueberwachung der gesammten geistigen und\r\n    weltanschaulichen Schulung und Erziehung der NSDAP_).\r\n\r\n    _Hans Frank_—At one time head of the Legal Office of the party\r\n    (_Reichsleiter des Reichsrechtsamtes_).\r\n\r\n    _Baldur von Schirach_—Leader of Youth Education (_Leiter fuer\r\n    die Jugenderziehung_).\r\n\r\nand the late\r\n\r\n    _Robert Ley_—Leader of the Party Organization\r\n    (_Reichsorganisationsleiter der NSDAP_) and Leader of the German\r\n    Labor Front (_Leiter der Deutschen Arbeitsfront_).\r\n\r\nThe next categories to be considered are the _Hoheitstraeger_, the\r\n“bearers of sovereignty.” To them was assigned political sovereignty\r\nover specially designated subdivisions of the state of which they were\r\nthe appointed leaders. The _Hoheitstraeger_ may be said to represent the\r\nvertical organization of the party. These leaders included all:\r\n\r\n    _a. Gauleiter_, of which there were 42 within the Reich in 1945.\r\n    A _Gauleiter_ was the political leader of the largest\r\n    subdivision of the State. He was charged by the Fuehrer with\r\n    political, cultural, and economic control over the life of the\r\n    people, which he was to coordinate with the National Socialist\r\n    ideology. A number of the defendants before the bar of the\r\n    Tribunal were former _Gauleiter_ of the NSDAP. Among them are\r\n    Julius Streicher (Franconia) whose seat was in Nurnberg, Baldur\r\n    von Schirach (Vienna), and Fritz Sauckel (Thuringia).\r\n\r\n    _b. Kreisleiter_, the political leaders of the largest\r\n    subdivision of a _Gau_.\r\n\r\n    _c. Ortsgruppenleiter_, the political leaders of the largest\r\n    subdivision of a _Kreis_ consisting of several towns or\r\n    villages, or of a part of a larger city, and including from 1500\r\n    to 3000 households.\r\n\r\n    _d. Zellenleiter_, the political leaders of a group of from 4 to\r\n    8 city blocks or of a corresponding grouping of households in\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\n    _e. Blockleiter_, the political leaders of from 40 to 60\r\n    households.\r\n\r\nEach of these _Hoheitstraeger_, or “bearers of sovereignty,” was\r\ndirectly responsible to the next highest leader in the Nazi hierarchy.\r\nThe _Gauleiter_ was directly subordinate to the _Fuehrer_ himself, the\r\n_Kreisleiter_ was directly subordinate to the _Gauleiter_, the\r\n_Ortsgruppenleiter_ to the _Kreisleiter_, and so on. The _Fuehrer_\r\nhimself appointed all _Gauleiter_ and _Kreisleiter_, all _Reichsleiter_,\r\nand all other political leaders within the Party Directorate\r\n(_Reichsleitung_) down to the grade of _Gauamtsleiter_, the head of a\r\nsubdivision of the party organization within a _Gau_.\r\n\r\nThe _Hoheitstraeger_ and _Reichsleitung_ together constituted the\r\nall-powerful group of leaders by means of which the Nazi party reached\r\ninto the lives of the people, consolidated its control over them, and\r\ncompelled them to conform to the National Socialist pattern. For this\r\npurpose, broad powers were given them, including the right to call upon\r\nall party machinery to effectuate their plans. They could requisition\r\nthe services of the SA and of the SS, as well as of the HJ and the NSKK.\r\n\r\nThe controlled party organizations (_Gliederungen der NSDAP_) actually\r\nconstituted the party itself, and substantially the entire party\r\nmembership was contained within these organizations, viz.:\r\n\r\n    SA—NS Storm Troops (_Sturmabteilungen_).\r\n\r\n    SS—NS Elite Corps (_Schutzstaffeln_).\r\n\r\n    NSKK—NS Motor Corps (_Kraftfahrkorps_).\r\n\r\n    HJ—Hitler Youth (_Hitlerjugend_).\r\n\r\n    NS Women’s Organization (_Frauenschaft_).\r\n\r\n    NS German Students’ Bund (_Deutscher Studentenbund_).\r\n\r\n    NS University Teachers’ Bund (_Deutscher Dozentenbund_).\r\n\r\nThere were additional affiliated organizations (_Angeschlossene\r\nVerbaende der NSDAP_). Among these were included the following:\r\n\r\n    DAF—German Labor Front (_Deutsche Arbeitsfront_).\r\n\r\n    NS Public Welfare Organization (_Volkswohlfahrt_).\r\n\r\n    NS War Victims’ Organization (_Kriegsopferversorgung_).\r\n\r\n    NS Bund for German Technology (_Bund Deutscher Technik_).\r\n\r\n    German Civil Service (_Reichsbund der Deutschen Beamten_).\r\n\r\n    NS Physicians’ Bund (_Deutscher Aerztebund_).\r\n\r\n    NS Teachers’ Bund (_Lehrerbund_).\r\n\r\n    NS League of Legal Officials (_Rechtswahrerbund_).\r\n\r\nA third group of organizations was officially known as supervised\r\norganizations (_Betreute Organisationen der NSDAP_). These included the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    German Women’s Work (_Deutsches Frauenwerk_).\r\n\r\n    German Students’ Society (_Deutsche Studentenschaft_).\r\n\r\n    NS Bund of Former German Students (_Altherrenbund der Deutschen\r\n    Studenten_).\r\n\r\n    Reich League “German Family” (_Reichsbund Deutsche Familie_).\r\n\r\n    German Communal Congress (_Deutscher Gemeindetag_).\r\n\r\n    NS Bund for Physical Exercise (_Reichsbund fuer\r\n    Leibesuebungen_).\r\n\r\nAccording to the official party designations, there was a fourth\r\nclassification known as _Weitere Nationalsozialistische Organisationen_,\r\nand in this category the following organizations appeared:\r\n\r\n    RAD—Reich Labor Service (_Reichsarbeitsdienst_), at one time\r\n    subordinate to the Reich Labor leader (_Reichsarbeitsfuehrer_).\r\n\r\n    NSFK—NS Flying Corps (_NS-Fliegerkorps_), which was subordinate\r\n    to the Reich Minister for Aviation.\r\n\r\n                  2. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE THIRD REICH\r\n\r\nThe prosecution has prepared another chart (_Chart No. 18_) delineating\r\nsubstantially the organizational structure of the government of the\r\nThird Reich, as it existed in March 1945, and “the chief leadership\r\npersonnel of the Reich Government and the Reich Administration during\r\nsaid years.” This chart has been prepared on the basis of information\r\ncontained in two well known official publications: The _Taschenbuch fuer\r\nVerwaltungsbeamte_, and the _Nationalsozialistischer Jahrbuch_,\r\nabove-mentioned, of which Robert Ley was publisher. The chart has been\r\nexamined, corrected, and certified by Wilhelm Frick, whose affidavit is\r\nsubmitted with it. It seems plain that Frick, a former Minister of\r\nInterior of the Reich from January 1933 to August 1943, was well\r\nqualified, by reason of his position and long service in public office\r\nduring the National Socialist regime, to certify to the substantial\r\naccuracy of the facts disclosed in this chart.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to commence with consideration of the\r\n_Reichsregierung_, a word which may not be translated literally as\r\n“government of the Reich.” The word _Reichsregierung_ was a word of art\r\napplied collectively to the ministers who composed the German cabinet.\r\nThe _Reichsregierung_, which has been named as a defendant group in this\r\nproceeding, includes the following:\r\n\r\n    _a._ Members of the ordinary cabinet after 30 January 1933, i.e.\r\n    Reich ministers with and without portfolio and all other\r\n    officials entitled to participate in the meetings of this\r\n    cabinet.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Members of the Council of Ministers for the Defense of the\r\n    Reich (_Ministerrat fuer die Reichsverteidigung_).\r\n\r\n    _c._ Members of the Secret Cabinet Council (_Geheimer\r\n    Kabinettsrat_).\r\n\r\nUnlike the cabinets and ministerial councils in countries not within the\r\norbit of the former Axis, the _Reichsregierung_, after 30 January 1933\r\nwhen Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the German Republic, did not\r\nremain merely the executive branch of the government. In short order it\r\nalso came to possess, and it exercised, legislative and other functions\r\nin the governmental system developed under the domination of the\r\nNational Socialist party.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to observe here that, unlike such NS party organizations as\r\nthe SS and the SA, the _Reichsregierung_ before 1933 was not a body\r\ncreated exclusively or predominantly for the purpose of committing\r\nillegal acts. The _Reichsregierung_ was an instrument of government\r\nprovided for by the Weimar Constitution. Under the Nazi regime, however,\r\nthe _Reichsregierung_ gradually became a primary agent of the party with\r\nfunctions formulated in accordance with the objectives and methods of\r\nthe party. The party was intended to be a _Fuehrerorden_, an order of\r\n_Fuehrers_, a pool of political leaders; and whole the party was—in the\r\nwords of a German law—“the bearer of the concept of the German State,”\r\nit was not identical with the State. Hence, in order to realize its\r\nideological and political objectives and to reach the German people, the\r\nparty had to avail itself of official state channels. The\r\n_Reichsregierung_, and the agencies and offices established by it, were\r\nthe chosen instruments by means of which party policies were converted\r\ninto legislative and administrative acts binding upon the German people\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this result, the _Reichsregierung_ was thoroughly\r\nremodelled so as to coordinate party and state machinery, in order to\r\nimpose the will of the _Fuehrer_ on the German people. On 30 January\r\n1933 the _Reichsregierung_ contained but few National Socialists. But as\r\nthe power of the party in the Reich grew, the composition of the cabinet\r\ncame to include an ever-increasing number of Nazis until, by January\r\n1937, no non-party member remained in the _Reichsregierung_. New cabinet\r\nposts were created and Nazis appointed to fill them. Many of these\r\ncabinet members were also in the _Reichsleitung_ of the party.\r\n\r\nTo give a few examples: Rosenberg, the Delegate of the _Fuehrer_ for\r\nIdeological Training and Education of the Party, was a member of the\r\n_Reichsregierung_ as Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories\r\n(_Reichsminister f. d. b. Ostgebiete_). Frick, the leader of the\r\nNational Socialist faction in the Reichstag, was also Minister of the\r\nInterior (_Reichsinnenminister_). Goebbels, the _Reichsleiter_ for\r\nPropaganda, also sat in the cabinet as Minister for Public Enlightenment\r\nand Propaganda (_Reichsminister fuer Volksaufklaerung und Propaganda_).\r\n\r\nAfter 25 July 1934, party participation in the work of the cabinet was\r\nat all times attained through Rudolf Hess, the Deputy of the _Feuhrer_.\r\nBy a decree of the _Fuehrer_, Hess was invested with power to take part\r\nin the editing of bills dealing with all departments of the Reich. Later\r\nthis power of the Fuehrer’s Deputy was expanded to include all executive\r\ndecisions and orders published in the _Reichsgesetzblatt_. After Hess’\r\nflight to England in 1941, Martin Bormann took over, as his successor,\r\nthe same function and, in addition, was given the authority of a Reich\r\nminister and made a member of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nOn 30 January 1937 Hitler accepted into the party those last few members\r\nof the cabinet who were not then party members. Only one cabinet member\r\nhad the strength of character to reject membership in the party; he was\r\nthe Minister of Ports and of Transportation, von Eltz-Ruebenach, who\r\nstated at the time that he was unable to reconcile membership in the\r\nNSDAP with his beliefs in Christianity. But such was not the case with\r\nConstantin von Neurath. He did not reject party membership. Nor did\r\nErich Raeder reject party membership. And if Hjalmar Schacht was not\r\nalready a party member at that time, then he too did not reject\r\nmembership on 30 January 1937.\r\n\r\nThe chart shows many other instances where party members on the highest\r\nas well as on subordinate levels occupied corresponding or other\r\npositions in the organization of the state.\r\n\r\n_a._ Hitler himself, the _Fuehrer_ of the NSDAP, was also the Chancellor\r\nof the Reich, with which office the office of President of the German\r\nRepublic was united after the death of President von Hindenburg in 1934.\r\n\r\n_b._ Goering, the successor designate of Hitler as Fuehrer of the NSDAP,\r\nwas a member of the cabinet as Minister for Air (_Luftfahrtminister_),\r\nand he also held many other important positions, including that of\r\nCommander in Chief of the _Luftwaffe_, the German air force, and\r\nDelegate for the Four Year Plan (_Beauftragter f. d. Vierjahresplan_).\r\n\r\n_c._ Heinrich Himmler, the notorious head of the SS (_Reichsfuehrer\r\nSS_), was also Chief of the German Police, reporting to Frick. He\r\nhimself later became Minister of the Interior after the attempted\r\nassassination of Hitler on 20 June 1944, which event also catapulted him\r\ninto the position of Commander in Chief of the German Reserve Army.\r\n\r\nThe _Reichstag_, which was the German parliament, presents an anomaly in\r\nthis picture. Under the Republic it had been the supreme law-making body\r\nof the Reich, subject only to a limited check by the _Reichsrat_\r\n(Council of the Reich), the President, and the German people themselves,\r\nby way of initiative and referendum. Putting their opposition to all\r\nforms of parliamentarism at once into effect, the Nazis proceeded to\r\ncurtail these legislative powers of the _Reichstag_, the _Reichsrat_,\r\nand the _Reichspraesident_.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of 24 March 1933 the cabinet was given unlimited legislative\r\npowers, including the right to deviate from the constitution.\r\nSubsequently the _Reichsrat_ was abolished; and later, upon the death of\r\nPresident von Hindenburg in 1934, the posts of Chancellor and President\r\nwere merged.\r\n\r\nThe development of the _Reichstag_ into an emasculated legislative body\r\nwas an intermediate step on the road to rule by Fuehrer decree, the\r\nultimate goal of the National Socialist party—and one which it\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nThe Nazis then proceeded to delegate some of the functions of the\r\n_Reichsregierung_ to various newly-created agencies. Cabinet functions\r\nwere delegated:\r\n\r\n1. To the _Reichsverteidigungsrat_, the Reich Defense Council, possibly\r\nas early as 4 April 1933 but certainly not later than May 1935. This was\r\na large war-planning group of which Hitler was chairman and Goering\r\nalternate. The group included many cabinet members, and a working\r\ncommittee, presided over by Fieldmarshal Wilhelm Keitel, was also\r\ncomposed of cabinet members and Reich defense officials, the majority of\r\nwhom were appointed by cabinet members and subordinate to them.\r\n\r\n2. To the Plenipotentiary for War Economy (_Generalbevollmaechtigter f.\r\nd. Kriegswirtschaft_), Hjalmar Schacht (and later Walter Funk), who by\r\nthe Secret Reich Defense Law of May 1935 was authorized to “begin his\r\nwork already in peacetime.”\r\n\r\n3. To the Plenipotentiary for Administration (_Generalbevollmaechtigter\r\nf. d. Reichsverwaltung_), Wilhelm Frick, whose deputy, Himmler, later\r\nsucceeded him, and who was appointed by a Secret Reich Defense Law.\r\nSubordinate to Frick as Plenipotentiary were the ministries of the\r\nInterior, Justice, Education, Church Affairs and _Raumordnung_ (Spatial\r\nPlanning).\r\n\r\n4. To the Delegate for the Four Year Plan (_Beauftragter f. d.\r\nVierjahresplan_), Goering.\r\n\r\n5. To the _Dreierkollegium_, the College of Three, consisting of the two\r\nPlenipotentiaries for War Economy and Administration, and Fieldmarshal\r\nKeitel as chief of the OKW. The duties of this _Dreierkollegium_ appear\r\nto have included the drafting of decrees in preparation of and for use\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n6. To the _Geheime Kabinettsrat_, the Secret Cabinet Council, created by\r\nFuehrer decree in February 1938, of which von Neurath was president; and\r\n\r\n7. To the _Ministerrat f. d. Reichsverteidigung_, the Council of\r\nMinisters for the Defense of the Reich, established by _Fuehrer_ decree\r\non 30 August 1939 and responsible to him alone. Its membership was taken\r\nfrom the Reich Defense Council. It had broad powers to issue decrees\r\nwith force of law insofar as the _Reichsregierung_ itself had not\r\nlegislated on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt should be stressed that this delegation of cabinet functions and\r\nauthority to various secret and semi-secret groups composed largely of\r\nits own members, helped to conceal some of the most important policies\r\nof the _Reichsregierung_, particularly those relating to preparation for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThus, step by step, the National Socialist party succeeded in putting\r\nits policies into effect through the machinery of the state, the\r\n_Reichsregierung_, in its revised form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chapter VII\r\n             MEANS USED BY THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS IN GAINING\r\n                       CONTROL OF THE GERMAN STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n            I. COMMON OBJECTIVES, METHODS, AND DOCTRINES OF\r\n                             THE CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\nIn 1921 Adolf Hitler became the supreme leader or _Fuehrer_ of the\r\n_Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei_ (National Socialist\r\nGerman Workers Party), also known as the Nazi Party, which had been\r\nfounded in Germany in 1920. He continued as such throughout the period\r\ncovered by the Indictment. As will be shown, the Nazi Party, together\r\nwith certain of its subsidiary organizations, became the instrument of\r\ncohesion among the defendants and their co-conspirators and an\r\ninstrument for the carrying out of the aims and purposes of the\r\nconspiracy. And as will also be shown, each defendant became a member of\r\nthe Nazi Party and of the conspiracy, with knowledge of their aims, and\r\npurposes, or, with such knowledge, became an accessory to their aims and\r\npurposes at some stage of the development of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nA. _Aims, and Purposes._ The aims and purposes of the Nazi conspirators\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n(1) _To abrogate and overthrow the Treaty of Versailles and its\r\nrestrictions upon the military armament and activity of Germany._ The\r\nfirst major public meeting of the NSDAP took place in Munich on 24\r\nFebruary 1920. At that meeting Hitler publicly announced the Program of\r\nthe Party. That program, consisting of 25 points (annually reprinted in\r\nthe National Socialist Yearbook), was referred to as “The political\r\nfoundation of the NSDAP and therewith the fundamental political law of\r\nthe state,” and “has remained unaltered” since the date of its\r\npromulgation. Section 2 of the Program provided as follows:\r\n\r\n    “We demand equality of rights for the German people with respect\r\n    to other nations, and abolition of the Peace Treaties of\r\n    Versailles and St. Germain.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech at Munich on 13 April 1923, Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “It was no Peace Treaty which they have signed, but a betrayal\r\n    of Peace. So long as this Treaty stands there can be no\r\n    resurrection of the German people: no social reform of any kind\r\n    is possible. The Treaty was made in order to bring 20 million\r\n    Germans to their deaths and to ruin the German nation. But those\r\n    who made the Treaty cannot set it aside. At its foundation our\r\n    movement formulated three demands:\r\n\r\n        1. Setting aside of the Peace Treaty\r\n\r\n        2. Unification of all Germans\r\n\r\n        3. Land and soil (_Grund und Boden_) to feed our\r\n        nation.” (_2405-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1923 Hitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “The day must come when a German government shall summon up the\r\n    courage to declare to the foreign powers: ‘The Treaty of\r\n    Versailles is founded on a monstrous lie.’ We fulfill nothing\r\n    more. Do what you will! If you want battle, look for it! Then we\r\n    shall see whether you can turn 70 million Germans into serfs and\r\n    slaves!” (_2405-PS_; see also additional statements of Hitler\r\n    contained in _2405-PS_ castigating those Germans who shared\r\n    responsibility for the Treaty of Versailles, viz; the “November\r\n    criminals.”)\r\n\r\nIn his speech of 30 January 1941 Hitler alluded to the consistency of\r\nhis record concerning the aims of National Socialist foreign policy:\r\n\r\n    “My foreign policy had identical aims. My program was to abolish\r\n    the Treaty of Versailles. It is futile nonsense for the rest of\r\n    the world to pretend today that I did not reveal this program\r\n    until 1933 or 1935 or 1937. Instead of listening to the foolish\r\n    chatter of emigrés, these gentlemen would have been wiser to\r\n    read what I have written thousands of times.\r\n\r\n    “No human being has declared or recorded what he wanted more\r\n    than I. Again and again I wrote these words: ‘The abolition of\r\n    the Treaty of Versailles’. * * *” (_2541-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilar views were expressed by other Nazi conspirators. Rosenberg\r\nstated that the lie of Germany’s war guilt was the basis of the Treaties\r\nof Versailles and St. Germain. He rejected the idea of a “revision” of\r\nthose Treaties and demanded outright cancellation. (_2433-PS_)\r\n\r\nHess, in advocating rearmament in violation of treaty restrictions,\r\nstated in 1986 that “guns instead of butter” were necessary lest “one\r\nday our last butter be taken from us.” (_2426-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _To acquire the territories lost by Germany as the result of the\r\nWorld War of 1914-1918, and other territories in Europe asserted to be\r\noccupied by so-called “racial Germans.”_ Section I of the Nazi Party\r\nPlatform gave advance notice of the intentions of the Nazi conspirators\r\nto claim territories occupied by so-called racial Germans. It provided:\r\n\r\n    “We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany\r\n    on the basis of the right of self-determination of people.”\r\n    (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhile Rosenberg pointed out in 1922 that it was not possible at that\r\ntime to designate “such European and non European territories which\r\nwould be taken into consideration for colonization” he nevertheless\r\nstated that the following could be laid down as a basic objective,\r\nnamely that\r\n\r\n    “* * * German Foreign Policy must make its most important\r\n    primary goal the consolidation of all Germans living closely\r\n    together in Europe in one state and to secure the territory of\r\n    what today is the Polish-Czech East.” (_2433-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his Reichstag speech of 20 February 1928 Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “The claim, therefore, for German colonial possession will be\r\n    voiced from year to year with increasing vigor, possessions\r\n    which Germany did not take away from other countries, and which\r\n    today are virtually of no value to these powers, but appear\r\n    indispensable for our own people.” (_2772-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain, in his Reichstag speech of 30 January 1939 Hitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “The theft of the German colonies was morally unjustified.\r\n    Economically, it was utter insanity. The political motives\r\n    advanced were so mean that one is tempted to call them silly. In\r\n    1918, after the end of the war, the victorious Powers really\r\n    would have had the authority to bring about a reasonable\r\n    settlement of international problems. * * *\r\n\r\n    “The great German colonial possessions, which the Reich once\r\n    acquired peacefully by treaties and by paying for them, have\r\n    been stolen—contrary indeed to the solemn assurance given by\r\n    President Wilson, which was the basic condition on which Germany\r\n    laid down her arms. The objection that these colonial\r\n    possessions are of no importance in any case should only lead to\r\n    their being returned to us with an easy mind.” (_2773-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _To acquire further territories in colonial Europe and elsewhere\r\nclaimed to be required by “racial Germans” as “Lebensraum” or living\r\nspace, at the expense of neighboring and other countries._ Hitler made\r\nit clear that the two objectives of the Nazi conspirators set forth\r\nabove were only preliminary steps in a more ambitious plan of\r\nterritorial aggrandizement. Thus he stated:\r\n\r\n    “One must take the point of view, coolly and soberly, that it\r\n    certainly cannot be the intention of Heaven to give one people\r\n    fifty times as much space (_Grund und Boden_) on this earth as\r\n    to another. One should not permit himself to be diverted in this\r\n    case by political boundaries from the boundaries of eternal\r\n    justice.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The boundaries of 1914 do not mean anything for the future of\r\n    the German nation. They did not represent either a defense of\r\n    the past nor would they represent a power in the future. The\r\n    German people will not obtain either its inner compactness by\r\n    them, nor will its nutrition be secured by them, nor do these\r\n    boundaries appear from a military standpoint as appropriate or\r\n    even satisfactory. * * *” (_2760-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhile the precise limits of German expansion were only vaguely defined\r\nby the Nazi conspirators, they clearly indicated that the _lebensraum_\r\nto which they felt they were entitled would be acquired primarily in the\r\nEast. Rosenberg was particularly insistent in his declarations that\r\nRussia would have to “move over” to make way for German living space. He\r\nunderlined this demand as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The understanding that the German nation, if it is not to\r\n    perish in the truest sense of the word, needs ground and soil\r\n    for itself and its future generations, and the second sober\r\n    perception that this soil can no more be conquered in Africa,\r\n    but in Europe and first of all in the East—these organically\r\n    determine the German foreign policy for centuries. (_2777-PS_)\r\n\r\n    “The Russians * * * will have to confine themselves so as to\r\n    remove their center of gravity to Asia.” (_2426-PS_)\r\n\r\nA similar view was expressed by Hitler in _Mein Kampf_:\r\n\r\n    “If one wanted territory in Europe, this could be done on the\r\n    whole at the expense of Russia, and the new Reich would have to\r\n    set out to march over the road of the former Knights, in order\r\n    to give soil to the German plow by means of the German sword,\r\n    and to give daily bread to the nation.” (_2760-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn _Mein Kampf_ Hitler threatened war as a means of attaining additional\r\nspace:\r\n\r\n    “If this earth really has space (_Raum_) for all to live in,\r\n    then we should be given the territory necessary. Of course, one\r\n    will not do that gladly. Then, however, the right of\r\n    self-preservation comes into force; that which is denied to\r\n    kindness, the fist will have to take. If our forefathers had\r\n    made their decisions dependent on the same pacifistic nonsense\r\n    as the present, then we would possess only a third of our\r\n    present territory.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In contrast, we, National Socialists, have to hold on steadily\r\n    to our foreign political goals, namely, _to secure on this earth\r\n    the territory due to the German people_. And this action is the\r\n    only one which will make bloody sacrifice before God and our\r\n    German posterity appear justified.” (_2760-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Methods. The Nazi conspirators advocated the accomplishment of the\r\nforegoing aims and purposes by any means deemed opportune, including\r\nillegal means and resort to threat of force, force, and aggressive war._\r\nThe use of force was distinctly sanctioned, in fact guaranteed, by\r\nofficial statements and directives of the conspirators which made\r\nactivism and aggressiveness a political quality obligatory for Party\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nHitler stated in _Mein Kampf_:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The lack of a great creative idea means at all times an\r\n    impairment of the fighting spirit. The conviction that it is\r\n    right to use even the most brutal weapons is always connected\r\n    with the existence of a fanatical belief that it is necessary\r\n    that a revolutionary new order of this earth should become\r\n    victorious. A movement which does not fight for these highest\r\n    aims and ideals will therefore never resort to the ultimate\r\n    weapon.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * It is not possible to undertake a task half-heartedly or\r\n    hesitatingly if its execution seems to be feasible only by\r\n    expending the very last ounce of energy . . . One had to become\r\n    clear in one’s mind that this goal [i.e. acquisition of new\r\n    territory in Europe] could be achieved by fight alone and then\r\n    had to face this armed conflict with calmness and composure.”\r\n    (_2760-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1934 Hitler set out the duties of Party members in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n    “Only a part of the people will be really active fighters. But\r\n    they were the fighters of the National Socialist struggle. They\r\n    were the fighters for the National Socialist revolution, and\r\n    they are the millions of the rest of the population. For them it\r\n    is not sufficient to confess: ‘I believe,’ but to swear: ‘_I\r\n    fight_’.” (_2775-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis same theme is expressed in the Party Organization Book:\r\n\r\n    “The Party includes _only fighters_ who are ready to accept and\r\n    sacrifice everything in order to carry through the National\r\n    Socialist ideology.” (_2774-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the trial of _Reichswehr_ officers at Leipzig in September 1930\r\nHitler testified:\r\n\r\n    “Germany is being strangled by Peace Treaties. * * * The\r\n    National Socialists do not regard the Treaty as a law, but as\r\n    something forced upon us. We do not want future generations, who\r\n    are completely innocent, to be burdened by this. When we fight\r\n    this with all means at our disposal, then we are on the way to a\r\n    revolution.”\r\n\r\nPresident of the Court: ‘Even by illegal means?’\r\n\r\n    Hitler: “I will declare here and now, that when we have become\r\n    powerful (_gesiegt haben_), then we shall fight against the\r\n    Treaty with all the means at our disposal, even from the point\r\n    of view of the world, with illegal means.” (_2512-PS_)\r\n\r\nMoreover, Hitler stated the true reason for rearmament as follows:\r\n\r\n    “It is impossible to build up an army and give it a sense of\r\n    worth if the object of its existence is not the preparation for\r\n    war. Armies for the preservation of peace do not exist; they\r\n    exist only for the triumphant exertion of war.” (_2541-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _Doctrines. The Nazi conspirators adopted and published the following\r\ndoctrines:_\r\n\r\n(1) _That persons of so-called “German blood” were a master race and\r\nwere accordingly entitled to subjugate, dominate, or exterminate other\r\n“races” and “peoples.”_ The Nazi doctrine of racial supremacy was\r\nincorporated as Point 4 in the Party Program of 24 February 1920, which\r\nprovided as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of the\r\n    race can only be one who is of German blood, without\r\n    consideration of creed. Consequently no Jew can be a member of\r\n    the race.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators’ dogma of the racial supremacy of the Germanic\r\npeoples was fully elucidated in the writings of Rosenberg:\r\n\r\n    “The meaning of world history has radiated out from the north\r\n    over the whole world, borne by a blue-eyed blond race which in\r\n    several great waves determined the spiritual face of the world *\r\n    * *\r\n\r\n    “We stand today before a definitive decision. Either through a\r\n    new experience and cultivation of the old blood, coupled with an\r\n    enhanced fighting will, we will rise to a purificatory action,\r\n    or the last Germanic-western values of morality and\r\n    state-culture shall sink away in the filthy human masses of the\r\n    big cities, become stunted on the sterile burning asphalt of a\r\n    bestialized inhumanity, or trickle away as a morbific agent in\r\n    the form of emigrants bastardizing themselves in South America,\r\n    China, Dutch East India, Africa.\r\n\r\n    “A new faith is arising today: the myth of the blood, the faith,\r\n    to defend with the blood the divine essence of man. The faith,\r\n    embodied in clearest knowledge that the Nordic blood represents\r\n    that mysterium which has replaced and overcome the old\r\n    sacraments.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, the Nazi conspirators acclaimed the “master race” doctrine as a\r\nnew religion—the faith of the blood—superseding in individual\r\nallegiance all other religions and institutions. According to Rosenberg:\r\n\r\n    “The new thought puts folk and race higher than the state and\r\n    its forms. It declares protection of the folk more important\r\n    than protection of a religious denomination, a class, the\r\n    monarchy, or the republic; it sees in treason against the folk a\r\n    greater crime than treason against the state.” (_2771-PS_; see\r\n    also further excerpts from Rosenberg’s writings contained in\r\n    _2405-PS_.)\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the Nazi conspirators’ continued espousal and\r\nexploitation of racial dogmas following their accession to power was the\r\ndiscriminatory legislation which they caused to be enacted. These laws,\r\nwith particular reference to Jews, are set forth in Section 7 of this\r\nChapter on the Program for Persecution of Jews.\r\n\r\nThe logical consequence of the “master race” dogma, in its bearing on\r\nthe right of Germany to dominate other “inferior” peoples and to acquire\r\nsuch of their territory as was considered necessary for German living\r\nspace, was disclosed by the Nazi conspirators. In a speech concluding\r\nthe _Reichsparteitag_ at Nurnberg on 3 September 1933 Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “But long ago man has proceeded in the same way with his\r\n    fellowman. The higher race—at first ‘higher’ in the sense of\r\n    possessing a greater gift for organization—subjects to itself a\r\n    lower race and thus constitutes a relationship which now\r\n    embraces races of unequal value. Thus there results the\r\n    subjection of a number of people under the will often of only a\r\n    few persons, a subjection based simply on the right of the\r\n    stronger, a right which, as we see it in Nature, can be regarded\r\n    as the sole conceivable right because founded on reason. The\r\n    wild mustang does not take upon itself the yoke imposed by man\r\n    either voluntarily or joyfully; neither does one people welcome\r\n    the violence of another.” (_2584-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Fuehrerprinzip (Fuehrer Principle)._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Essential elements._\r\n\r\n    _1. Complete and total authority is vested in the Fuehrer._\r\n\r\n        “The Fuehrer Principle requires a pyramidal organization\r\n        structure in its details as well as in its entirety.\r\n\r\n        “The Fuehrer is at the top.\r\n\r\n        “He nominates the necessary leaders for the various\r\n        spheres of work of the Reich’s direction, the Party\r\n        apparatus and the State administration.” (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\n        “He shapes the collective will of the people within\r\n        himself and he enjoys the political unity and entirety\r\n        of the people in opposition to individual interests.\r\n\r\n        “The Fuehrer unites in himself all the sovereign\r\n        authority of the Reich; all public authority in the\r\n        state as well as in the movement is derived from the\r\n        authority of the Fuehrer. We must speak not of the\r\n        state’s authority but of the Fuehrer’s authority if we\r\n        wish to designate the character of the political\r\n        authority within the Reich correctly. The state does not\r\n        hold political authority as an impersonal unit but\r\n        receives it from the Fuehrer as the executor of the\r\n        national will. The authority of the Fuehrer is complete\r\n        and all-embracing; it unites in itself all the means of\r\n        political direction; it extends into all fields of\r\n        national life; it embraces the entire people, which is\r\n        bound to the Fuehrer in loyalty and obedience. The\r\n        authority of the Fuehrer is not limited by checks and\r\n        controls, by special autonomous bodies or individual\r\n        rights, but it is free and independent, all-inclusive\r\n        and unlimited.\r\n\r\n        “The Fuehrer-Reich of the (German) people is founded on\r\n        the recognition that the true will of the people cannot\r\n        be disclosed through parliamentary votes and plebiscites\r\n        but that the will of the people in its pure and\r\n        uncorrupted form can only be expressed through the\r\n        Fuehrer.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\n        “Thus at the head of the Reich, stands a single Fuehrer,\r\n        who in his personality embodies the idea which sustains\r\n        all and whose spirit and will therefore animate the\r\n        entire community.” (_2780-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs stated in the Organization Book of the Nazi Party:\r\n\r\n        “The will of the Fuehrer is the Party’s law.”\r\n        (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\n    The first commandment for the Party members declares:\r\n\r\n        “The Fuehrer is always right.” (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\n        “He (the Fuehrer) is responsible only to his conscience\r\n        and the German people.” (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\n    Hess, in a speech broadcast at Cologne on 25 June 1934,\r\n    characterized the position of the Fuehrer as follows:\r\n\r\n        “It is with pride that we see that one man is kept above\r\n        all criticism—that is the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n        “The reason is that everyone feels and knows: he was\r\n        always right and will always be right. The National\r\n        Socialism of us all is anchored in the uncritical\r\n        loyalty, in the devotion to the Fuehrer that does not\r\n        ask for the wherefore in the individual case, in the\r\n        tacit performance of his commands. We believe that the\r\n        Fuehrer is fulfilling a divine mission to German\r\n        destiny! This belief is beyond challenge.” (_2426-PS_;\r\n        see also additional statements of the Nazi conspirators\r\n        designed to condition the German people to blind\r\n        acceptance of the decisions of the Fuehrer and his\r\n        co-conspirators, as translated in _2373-PS_.)\r\n\r\n    _2. The Fuehrer’s power descends to sub-leaders in a hierarchial\r\n    order._ In the words of the Organization Book of the NSDAP:\r\n\r\n        “The Party is the order of fuehrers.\r\n\r\n        “All political directors (_Politische Leiter_) stand as\r\n        appointed by the Fuehrer and are responsible to him.\r\n        They possess full authority towards the lower echelons.\r\n        (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n        “He (The Fuehrer) nominates the necessary leaders for\r\n        the various spheres of work of the Reichs’ direction,\r\n        the Party apparatus, and the State administration.”\r\n        (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\n    The effect of this was aptly expressed by Hitler in 1933:\r\n\r\n        “When our opponents said, ‘It is easy for you: you are a\r\n        dictator’—We answer them, ‘No, gentlemen, you are\r\n        wrong; there is no single dictator, but ten thousand,\r\n        each in his own place.’ And even the highest authority\r\n        in the hierarchy has itself only one wish, never to\r\n        transgress against the supreme authority to which it,\r\n        too, is responsible.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\n    _3. Each subleader is bound to unconditional obedience to his\r\n    immediate superior and to the Fuehrer._ As Hitler said,\r\n\r\n        “We have in our movement developed this loyalty in\r\n        following the leader, this blind obedience of which all\r\n        the others know nothing and which gave to us the power\r\n        to surmount everything.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\n    The duty of obedience is so fundamental that it is incorporated\r\n    as the second of the NSDAP commandments for party members:\r\n\r\n        “Never go against discipline!” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\n    As Ley said:\r\n\r\n        “Our conscience is clearly and exactly defined. Only\r\n        what Adolf Hitler, our Fuehrer, commands, allows, or\r\n        does not allow is our conscience.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\n    The obedience required was not the loyalty of a soldier to the\r\n    Fatherland, as was the case prior to the Nazi regime. On the\r\n    contrary, the obedience exacted was unconditional and absolute,\r\n    regardless of the legality or illegality of the order. The oath\r\n    taken by political leaders (_Politische Leiter_) yearly was as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n        “I pledge eternal allegiance to Adolf Hitler. I pledge\r\n        unconditional obedience to him and the Fuehrers\r\n        appointed by him.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n    _4. Each subleader is absolute in his own sphere of\r\n    jurisdiction._ The Nazi Party Organization Book lays down the\r\n    same principle with respect to the successive tiers of its\r\n    leaders:\r\n\r\n        “The Fuehrer Principle represented by the Party imposes\r\n        complete responsibility on all party leaders for their\r\n        respective spheres of activity * * * The responsibility\r\n        for all tasks within a major sphere of jurisdiction\r\n        rests with the respective leader of the NSDAP: i.e.,\r\n        with the Fuehrer for the territory of the Reich, the\r\n        Gauleiter for the territory of the Gau, the district\r\n        leader for the territory of the district, the local\r\n        leader for the territory of the local group, etc.\r\n\r\n        “The Party leader has responsibility for the entire\r\n        territory under his jurisdiction on the one hand, and on\r\n        the other hand, his own political fields of activity\r\n        appertaining thereto.\r\n\r\n        “This responsibility for the complete or partial\r\n        performance of task entails a relationship of\r\n        subordination of the leaders among themselves,\r\n        corresponding to the fuehrer principle.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Glorification of War as a noble and necessary activity of Germans._\r\nThe Nazi conspirators disseminated dogmas designed to engender in the\r\nmasses a deep reverence for the vocation of the warrior and to induce\r\nacceptance of the postulate that the waging of war was good and\r\ndesirable _per se_. The motive underlying the concerted program of the\r\nNazis to glorify war was disclosed by Hitler in _Mein Kampf_:\r\n\r\n    “Thus the question of how to regain German power is not: How\r\n    shall we manufacture arms?, but: How do we create the spirit\r\n    which enables a nation to bear arms? If this spirit governs a\r\n    people, the will finds thousands of ways, each of which ends\r\n    with a weapon!”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * Oppressed countries are led back into the lap of a common\r\n    Reich by a mighty sword and not by flaming protests. It is the\r\n    task of the inner political leaders of a people to forge this\r\n    sword; to safeguard the work of the smith and to seek comrades\r\n    in arms in the task of the foreign policy.” (_2760-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler’s writings and public utterances are full of declarations\r\nrationalizing the use of force and glorifying war. The following are\r\ntypical:\r\n\r\n    “Always before God and the world, the stronger has the right to\r\n    carry through his will. History proves it: He who has no might,\r\n    has no use for might. (_2405-PS_)\r\n\r\n    “The political testament of the German People for its foreign\r\n    policy should and must always follow this line of thought: Never\r\n    tolerate the rise of two continental powers in Europe. See in\r\n    every attempt to organize a second military power, * * * an\r\n    attack against Germany and take therefrom not only the right but\r\n    the duty to prevent by all means, including the use of arms, the\r\n    rise of such a state, respectively to destroy such a state if it\r\n    has already arisen. Take care that the strength of our people\r\n    should have its foundation not in colonies but in the soil of\r\n    the home country in Europe. Never consider the Reich as secured\r\n    as long as it cannot give to every descendant of our people his\r\n    own bit of soil for centuries to come; never forget that the\r\n    most sacred right on this earth is the right to own the soil\r\n    which one wants to cultivate and the most sacred sacrifice, the\r\n    blood which is shed for this soil.” (_2760-A-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _The leadership of the Nazi Party._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Nazi Party leadership was the sole bearer of the doctrines of\r\nthe Nazi Party._ The Party Organization Book declares:\r\n\r\n    “The Party as an instrument of ideological education, must grow\r\n    to be the Leader Corps (_Fuehrer Korps_) of the German Nation.\r\n\r\n    “This Leader Corps is responsible for the complete penetration\r\n    of the German Nation with the National Socialist spirit * * *”\r\n    (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\n    “The Party is the order of fuehrers. It is furthermore\r\n    responsible for the spiritual ideological National Socialist\r\n    direction of the German people.” (_1814-PS_)\r\n\r\nReferring to the mission of the _Ortsgruppenleiter_ (local chapter\r\nleader) of the NSDAP, the Party Organization Book states:\r\n\r\n    “As Hoeheitstraeger (bearer of sovereignty) all expressions of\r\n    the party will emanate from him; he is responsible for the\r\n    political and ideological leadership and organization within his\r\n    zone of sovereignty.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilar statements are made with regard to the _Kreisleiter_ (county\r\nleader) and the _Gauleiter_ (Gau leader) and the Reich Directorate\r\n(1893-PS).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Nazi Party leadership was entitled to control and dominate\r\nthe German state and all related institutions and all individuals\r\ntherein._ Hitler said at the 1935 Nurnberg Party Congress:\r\n\r\n    “It is not the State which gives orders to us, it is we who give\r\n    orders to the State.” (_2775-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrick declared in a similar vein:\r\n\r\n    “In National Socialist Germany, leadership is in the hands of an\r\n    organized community, the National Socialist Party; and as the\r\n    latter represents the will of the nation, the policy adopted by\r\n    it in harmony with the vital interests of the nation is at the\r\n    same time the policy adopted by the country. * * *” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoebbels declared:\r\n\r\n    “The Party must always continue to represent the hierarchy of\r\n    National Socialist leadership. This minority must always insist\r\n    upon its prerogative to control the state. * * * It is\r\n    responsible for the leadership of the state and it solemnly\r\n    relieves the people of this responsibility.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\nHess remarked that the Party was a “necessity” in the German state and\r\nconstituted the cohesive mechanism with which to “organize and direct\r\noffensively and defensively the spiritual and political strength of the\r\npeople.” (_2426-PS_)\r\n\r\nNazi interpreters of constitutional law expressed the same idea:\r\n\r\n    “The NSDAP is not a structure which stands under direct state\r\n    control, to which single tasks of public administration are\r\n    entrusted by the state, but it holds and maintains its claim to\r\n    totality as the ‘bearer of the German state-idea’ in all fields\r\n    relating to the community—regardless of how various single\r\n    functions are divided between the organization of the Party and\r\n    the organization of the State.” (_2771-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis doctrine was incorporated into laws which established the NSDAP as\r\n“the only political party in Germany” and declared the NSDAP “The bearer\r\nof the German state-idea” and “indissolubly linked to the state.”\r\n(_1388-A-PS_; _1395-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Nazi Party leadership was entitled to destroy all opponents._\r\nReference is made generally to Sections2 and 3 on the Acquisition and\r\nConsolidation of Political Control of Germany for proof of this\r\nallegation.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO COMMON OBJECTIVES,\r\n                METHODS, AND DOCTRINES OF THE CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6, especially 6 (a).│  I   │       5\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (B,  │      │\r\n                │  C).                                   │  I   │  16, 17\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

ACQUISITION OF TOTALITARIAN POLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nA. _First Steps in Acquiring Control of State Machinery._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Nazi conspirators first sought control of State machinery by\r\nforce. The Munich Putsch of 1923, aimed at the overthrow of the Weimar\r\nRepublic by direct action, failed._ On 8 November 1923 the so-called\r\nMunich Putsch occurred. During the evening, von Kahr, State Commissioner\r\nGeneral of Bavaria, was speaking at the _Buergerbraeukeller_ in Munich.\r\nHitler and other Nazi leaders appeared, supported by the\r\n_Sturmabteilungen_ (Storm Troops) and other fighting groups. Hitler\r\nfired a shot and announced that a Nationalist Revolution setting up a\r\ndictatorship had taken place. There followed a conference after which\r\nvon Kahr, von Lossow, and Colonel of Police von Seisser, announced they\r\nwould cooperate with Hitler and that a “Provisional National Government”\r\nwas established, as follows:\r\n\r\n           Reich Chancellor                       Adolf Hitler\r\n           Leader of the National Army     Gen. von Ludendorff\r\n           Reich Minister of War                    von Lossow\r\n           Reich Minister of Police                von Seisser\r\n           Reich Finance Minister                        Feder\r\n\r\nIt was also announced that Kahr would be State Administrator for\r\nBavaria, Poehner would be Bavarian Prime Minister, and Frick would be\r\nMunich Police President. Kahr, Lossow and Seisser then departed. During\r\nthe night the latter group alerted the police, brought troops to Munich,\r\nand announced that their consent to the Putsch had been obtained by\r\nforce. On the afternoon of the next day, Hitler, Ludendorff, and their\r\nsupporters attempted to march into the center of Munich. At the\r\n_Feldherrnhalle_ the procession met a patrol of police, shots were\r\nexchanged, and men on both sides were killed. Hermann Goering was\r\nwounded, the Putsch was broken up, the Party and its organization were\r\ndeclared illegal, and its leaders, including Hitler, Frick, and\r\nStreicher were arrested. Rosenberg, together with Amann and Drexler,\r\ntried to keep the Party together after it had been forbidden. Hitler and\r\nothers later were tried for high treason. At the trial Hitler admitted\r\nhis participation in the foregoing attempt to seize control of the State\r\nby force. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.

He was asked: “How do you imagine the\r\nsetting up of a Third Reich?” His reply was, “This term only describes\r\nthe basis of the struggle but not the objective. We will enter the legal\r\norganizations and will make our Party a decisive factor in this way.

Frick wrote in 1927:\r\n\r\n    “There is no National Socialist and no racialist who expects any\r\n    kind of manly German deed from that gossip club on the\r\n    Koenigsplatz and who is not convinced of the necessity for\r\n    direct action by the unbroken will of the German people to bring\r\n    about their spiritual and physical liberation. But there is a\r\n    long road ahead. After the failure of November, 1923, there was\r\n    no choice but to begin all over again and to strive to bring\r\n    about a change in the spirit and determination of the most\r\n    valuable of our racial comrades, as the indispensable\r\n    prerequisite for the success of the coming fight for freedom.\r\n    Our activities in parliament must be evaluated as merely part of\r\n    this propaganda work.\r\n\r\n    “Our participation in the parliament does not indicate a\r\n    support, but rather an undermining of the parliamentarian\r\n    system. It does not indicate that we renounce our\r\n    anti-parliamentarian attitude, but that we are fighting the\r\n    enemy with his own weapons and that we are fighting for our\r\n    National Socialist goal from the parliamentary platform.”\r\n    (_2742-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 April 1928, Goebbels wrote in his paper “_Der Angriff_”;\r\n\r\n    “We enter parliament in order to supply ourselves, in the\r\n    arsenal of democracy, with its own weapons. We become members of\r\n    the Reichstag in order to paralyze the Weimar sentiment with its\r\n    own assistance. If democracy is so stupid as to give us free\r\n    tickets and _per diem_ for the this “blockade” (_Barendienst_),\r\n    that is its own affair.”\r\n\r\nLater in the same article he continued:\r\n\r\n    “We do not come as friends, nor even as neutrals. We come as\r\n    enemies: As the wolf bursts into the flock, so we come.”\r\n    (_2500-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet published in 1935, Goebbels said:\r\n\r\n    “When democracy granted democratic methods for us in the times\r\n    of opposition, this was bound to happen in a democratic system.\r\n    However, we National Socialists never asserted that we\r\n    represented a democratic point of view, but we have declared\r\n    openly that we used democratic methods only in order to gain the\r\n    power and that, after assuming the power, we would deny to our\r\n    adversaries without any consideration the means which were\r\n    granted to us in the times of opposition. (_2412-PS_)\r\n\r\nA leading Nazi writer on Constitutional Law, Ernst Rudolf Huber, later\r\nwrote of this period:\r\n\r\n    “The parliamentary battle of the NSDAP had the single purpose of\r\n    destroying the parliamentary system from within through its own\r\n    methods. It was necessary above all to make formal use of the\r\n    possibilities of the party-state system but to refuse real\r\n    cooperation and thereby to render the parliamentary system,\r\n    which is by nature dependent upon the responsible cooperation of\r\n    the opposition, incapable of action.” (_2633-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi members of the Reichstag conducted themselves as a storm troop\r\nunit. Whenever representatives of the government or the democratic\r\nparties spoke, the Nazi members marched out in a body in studied\r\ncontempt of the speaker, or entered in a body to interrupt the speaker,\r\nthus making it physically impossible for the Reichstag President to\r\nmaintain order. In the case of speakers of opposition parties, the Nazi\r\nmembers constantly interrupted, often resorting to lengthy and spurious\r\nparliamentary maneuvers, with the result that the schedule of the\r\nsession was thrown out of order. The tactics finally culminated in\r\nphysical attacks by the Nazis upon members of the house as well as upon\r\nvisitors. (_L-83_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter of 24 August 1931 to Rosenberg, Hitler deplored an article\r\nin “_Voelkischer Beobachter_” the effect of which was to prevent\r\nundermining of support for the then existing form of government, and\r\nsaid: “I myself am travelling all over Germany to achieve exactly the\r\nopposite. (_047-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Nazi conspirators supported their “legal” activities by\r\nterrorism._\r\n\r\n    _1. The Nazi conspirators created and utilized as a Party\r\n    formation the Sturmabteilungen (SA) a semi-military voluntary\r\n    organization of young men trained for and committed to the use\r\n    of violence, whose mission was to make the Party the master of\r\n    the streets._ The SA was organized in 1921. As indicated by its\r\n    name, it was a voluntary organization of young men trained for\r\n    and committed to the use of violence. To quote from a pamphlet\r\n    compiled on order of the Supreme SA Headquarters:\r\n\r\n        “The SA was not founded as one forms just any sort of\r\n        club. It was born in midst of strife and received from\r\n        the Fuehrer himself the name “Storm Troops” after that\r\n        memorable hall battle in Hofbraeuhaus at Munich on the\r\n        4th of November 1921. * * * Blood and sacrifice were the\r\n        most faithful companions of the young SA on its hard\r\n        path to power. The Storm Troops were and still are today\r\n        the fist and propaganda arm of the movement”.\r\n        (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\n    It was organized along semi-military lines from the beginning.\r\n    To quote again from the same official pamphlet:\r\n\r\n        “It is one of the greatest historical services of the SA\r\n        that at the time when the German People’s Army had to\r\n        undergo a dissolution, it held high those virtues which\r\n        marked the German soldier: personal courage, idealism,\r\n        willingness to sacrifice, consciousness of\r\n        responsibility, power to decide, and leadership. Thus,\r\n        the SA became among the people the messenger and bearer\r\n        of German armed strength and German armed spirit.\r\n\r\n        “The 4th of November 1921 was not only the birth hour of\r\n        the SA by itself, but was the day from which the young\r\n        fighting troop of the Movement took its stand at the\r\n        focal point of political events. With the clear\r\n        recognition that now the unity (_Geschlossenheit_) of a\r\n        troop led to victory, the SA was systematically\r\n        reorganized and so-called “Centuries”\r\n        (_Hundertschaften_) were established * * *” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\n    In March 1928, Goering took command of the entire SA. In\r\n    November 1923, SA units were used in the Munich Putsch. When the\r\n    Party was reorganized in 1925, the SA continued to be the\r\n    fighting organization of the Party. Again to quote the official\r\n    pamphlet on the SA:\r\n\r\n        “And now a fight for Germany began of such a sort as was\r\n        never before fought. What are names, what are words or\r\n        figures which are not indeed able to express the\r\n        magnitude of belief and of idealism on one side and the\r\n        magnitude of hate on the other side. 1925: the Party\r\n        lives again, and its iron spearhead is the SA. With it\r\n        the power and meaning of the National Socialist movement\r\n        grows. Around the central events of the whole Movement,\r\n        the Reich Party Days, dates, decisions, fights and\r\n        victory roll themselves into a long list of German men\r\n        of undenying willingness to sacrifice.” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\n    Mastery of the streets was at all times the mission of the SA.\r\n    While discussing his ideas as to the part which this\r\n    organization should play in the political activity of his Party,\r\n    Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n        “What we needed and still need were and are not a\r\n        hundred or two hundred reckless conspirators, but a\r\n        hundred thousand and a second hundred thousand fighters\r\n        for our philosophy of life. We should not work in secret\r\n        conventicles, but in mighty mass demonstrations, and it\r\n        is not by dagger and poison or pistol that the road can\r\n        be cleared for the movement but by the conquest of the\r\n        streets. We must teach the Marxists that the future\r\n        master of the streets is National Socialism, just as it\r\n        will some day be the master of the state.” (_404-PS_)\r\n\r\n    To quote again from the official SA pamphlet:\r\n\r\n        “Possession of the streets is the key to power in the\r\n        state—for this reason the SA marched and fought. The\r\n        public would have never received knowledge from the\r\n        agitative speeches of the little Reichstag faction and\r\n        its propaganda or from the desires and aims of the\r\n        Party, if the martial tread and battle song of the SA\r\n        companies had not beat the measure for the truth of a\r\n        relentless criticism of the state of affairs in the\r\n        governmental system. * * *\r\n\r\n        “The SA conquered for itself a place in public opinion\r\n        and the leadership of the National Socialist Movement\r\n        dictated to its opponents the law for quarrels. The SA\r\n        was already a state within a state; a part of the future\r\n        in a sad present.” (_2168-PS_; for further material\r\n        concerning the SA, see Section 4 of Chapter XV.)\r\n\r\n    _2. The Nazi conspirators constantly used physical violence and\r\n    terror to break up meetings of political opponents, and to\r\n    suppress opposition in their own meetings._ The following facts\r\n    are indicative of the methods constantly used by the Nazi\r\n    conspirators during this period: On numerous occasions meetings\r\n    of the _Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft_ (Peace Society) were\r\n    broken up and terrorized by shock troops and SA units. Groups of\r\n    National Socialists invaded meetings of the society, interrupted\r\n    the speaker, attempted to attack him, and endeavored to make\r\n    sufficient disturbance so that the meetings would have to be\r\n    cancelled. (_L-83_)\r\n\r\n    To quote once again from the official SA pamphlet:\r\n\r\n        “* * * As an example of a seemingly impossible deed, the\r\n        11th of February 1927 should be firmly preserved. It is\r\n        the day on which the SA broke the Red Terror, with heavy\r\n        sacrifice, in the hall battle at the Pharoah’s Hall\r\n        (_Pharussaelen_) in Berlin, the stronghold of the\r\n        Communists, and thereby established itself decisively in\r\n        the capitol city of the Reich. In considering the badly\r\n        wounded SA men, Dr. Goebbels coined the phrase “unknown\r\n        SA Man”, who silently fights and bleeds, obeying only\r\n        his duty.” (_2168-PS_)\r\n\r\n    In Berlin, under the leadership of Goebbels, so-called\r\n    _Rollkommandos_, were organized for the purpose of disrupting\r\n    political meetings of all non-Nazi groups. These _Rollkommandos_\r\n    were charged with interrupting, making noise, and unnerving the\r\n    speaker. Finally the Nazis broke up meetings by _Rollkommando_\r\n    raids. In many cases, fights resulted, during which furniture\r\n    was destroyed and a number of persons hurt. The Nazis armed\r\n    themselves with blackjacks, brass knuckles, rubber truncheons,\r\n    walking sticks, and beer bottles. After the Reichstag election\r\n    of 1930, Nazi terrorism became more overt, and from then on\r\n    scarcely a day went by when the Chief of the Security Police in\r\n    Berlin did not receive a minimum of five to ten reports, and\r\n    often more, of riots instigated by Nazis. (_2955-PS_)\r\n\r\n    During the campaign for the Reichstag election of 14 September\r\n    1930, Nazi conspirators made it a practice to send speakers\r\n    accompanied by many Storm Troopers to meetings of other\r\n    political parties, often physically taking over the meetings. On\r\n    one such occasion a large detachment of Storm Troopers, some of\r\n    whom were armed with pistols and clubs, attended a meeting\r\n    called by the Social Democratic Party, succeeded in forcibly\r\n    excluding everybody not in sympathy with their views, and\r\n    concluded the meeting as their own. Such violent tactics,\r\n    repeated many times, were an integral part of the political\r\n    creed of the Nazi. (_L-83_)\r\n\r\n    Ultimately, in Berlin, just before the Nazis seized power, it\r\n    was necessary to devote the entire Police Force to the job of\r\n    fighting the Nazis, thus leaving little time for other Police\r\n    duties. (_2955-PS_)\r\n\r\n    _3. The Nazi conspirators constantly threatened their opponents\r\n    with organized reprisals and terror._ During the course of the\r\n    trial of three officers of the _Reichswehr_ for high treason in\r\n    Leipzig in September 1931, Hitler said:\r\n\r\n        “But I may assure you that if the Nazi movement’s\r\n        struggle is successful, then there will be a Nazi Court\r\n        of Law too, the November 1918 revolution will be atoned,\r\n        and there’ll be some heads chopped off.” (_2512-PS_)\r\n\r\n    Frick wrote in the National Socialist Yearbook for 1930:\r\n\r\n        “No wonder that as the situation of the entire German\r\n        people, as well as that of the individual racial\r\n        comrade, grows rapidly worse, increased numbers are\r\n        realizing the incompetence of the parliamentarian\r\n        system, and no wonder that even some who are responsible\r\n        for the present system desperately cry for a\r\n        dictatorship.

On 9 March 1933, Frick announced that the\r\nCommunists would be prevented from participating in the first session of\r\nthe Reichstag on March 21st, because of their being more usefully\r\noccupied. (_2403-PS_) As Frick cynically stated:\r\n\r\n    “When the Reichstag meets the 21st of March, the Communists will\r\n    be prevented by urgent labor elsewhere from participating in the\r\n    session. In concentration camps they will be re-educated for\r\n    productive work. We will know how to render harmless permanently\r\n    sub-humans who do not want to be re-educated.” (_2651-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Reich Cabinet on 15 March 1933, the problem of\r\nsecuring the necessary two-thirds majority in favor of an Enabling Act\r\nwas again considered. Frick stated his belief that the Act would have to\r\nbe broadly-conceived, in a manner to allow for any deviation from the\r\nclauses of the Constitution of the Reich. Goering thought the two-thirds\r\nmajority would be forthcoming and that if necessary some of the Social\r\nDemocrats could be excluded from the room during the voting. (_2962-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Cabinet on 20 March 1933, there was further\r\ndiscussion of means for securing the majority and quorum necessary to\r\nsecure passage of the Act (_2963-PS_). On 23 March, Hitler spoke in\r\nfavor of an Enabling Law proposed by the Nazi conspirators and in the\r\ncourse of the debate said:\r\n\r\n    “The Government insists on the passage of this law. It expects a\r\n    clear decision in any case. It offers to all the Parties in the\r\n    Reichstag the possibility of a peaceful development and a\r\n    possible conciliation in the future. But it is also determined\r\n    to consider a disapproval of this law as a declaration of\r\n    resistance. It is up to you, gentlemen, to make the decision\r\n    now. It will be either peace or war.” (_2652-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus subject to the full weight of Nazi pressure and terror, the\r\nReichstag passed the proposed law, 441 deputies voting in its favor, and\r\n94 Social Democrats being opposed (_2579-PS_). The following day, the\r\nlaw was promulgated. It provided:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichstag has resolved the following law, which is, with\r\n    the approval of the Reichsrat, herewith promulgated, after it\r\n    has been established that the requirements have been satisfied\r\n    for legislation altering the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    “SECTION 1. Reich laws can be enacted by the Reich Cabinet as\r\n    well as in accordance with the Procedure established in the\r\n    Constitution. This applies also to the laws referred to in\r\n    article 85, paragraph 2, and in article 87 of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    “SECTION 2. The national laws enacted by the Reich Cabinet may\r\n    deviate from the Constitution so far as they do not affect the\r\n    position of the Reichstag and the Reichsrat. The powers of the\r\n    President remain undisturbed.\r\n\r\n    “SECTION 3. The national laws enacted by the Reich Cabinet are\r\n    prepared by the Chancellor and published in the\r\n    Reichsgesetzblatt. They come into effect, unless otherwise\r\n    specified, upon the day following their publication. Articles 68\r\n    to 77 of the Constitution do not apply to the laws enacted by\r\n    the Reich Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    “SECTION 4. Treaties of the Reich with foreign states which\r\n    concern matters of national legislation do not require the\r\n    consent of the bodies participating in legislation. The Reich\r\n    Cabinet is empowered to issue the necessary provisions for the\r\n    execution of these treaties.\r\n\r\n    “SECTION 5. This law becomes effective on the day of its\r\n    publication. It becomes invalid on April 1, 1937; it further\r\n    becomes invalid when the present Reich Cabinet is replaced by\r\n    another.” (_2001-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe time limit stated in the law was twice extended by action of the\r\nReichstag and once by decree of Hitler. (_2047-PS_; _2048-PS_;\r\n_2103-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 29 June 1933, Dr. Hugenberg resigned as Reich Minister of Economy and\r\nas Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture (_351-PS_). Thereafter, other\r\nmembers of the Cabinet resigned from time to time, and new members were\r\nadded. The Reich Cabinet continued to exercise, on numerous occasions\r\nthe plenary powers conferred on it by the law of 24 March 1933. (See\r\nSection 3 of Chapter XV for further material on the Reich Cabinet.)\r\n\r\n(4) _The Nazi conspirators caused all political parties, except the Nazi\r\nParty, to be prohibited._ After the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933,\r\nthe organization of the Communist Party was destroyed. On 9 March 1933,\r\nthe Reich Minister of the Interior, Frick, announced that the Communists\r\nwould be prevented from taking part in the opening of the Reichstag on\r\n21 March 1933, because of their seditious activity. On 26 May 1933, a\r\nlaw was promulgated, signed by Hitler and Frick, providing for the\r\nconfiscation of Communist property. (_2403-PS_; _1396-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter suspension of the Constitutional guarantees of freedom on 28\r\nFebruary 1933, numerous restraints were imposed on the Social Democratic\r\nParty, including the arrest of a number of its leaders and Reichstag\r\ndeputies. The backbone of this Party was broken by the occupation of the\r\ntrade union buildings and the smashing of free trade unions in May 1933.\r\nOn 22 June 1933, the Social Democratic Party was suppressed in Prussia\r\n(_2403-PS_). On 7 July 1933 a Reich decree eliminated Social Democrats\r\nfrom the Reichstag and from the governing bodies of Provinces and\r\nMunicipalities. (_2058-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 14 July 1933, provisions of the Law of 26 May 1933 confiscating\r\nCommunist property were made applicable to assets and interests of the\r\nSocial Democratic Party and its affiliated organizations, “and also to\r\nassets and interests which are used or destined to promote Marxist or\r\nother activities found by the Reich Minister of the Interior to be\r\nsubversive to people and state.” (_1388-PS_) Faced with similar\r\npressure, the other German Parties either dissolved or combined with the\r\nNazis (_2403-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators then promulgated a law declaring the Nazi Party to\r\nbe the only political party in Germany and making it criminal to\r\nmaintain any other political party or to form a new political party.\r\nThis law, which was signed by Hitler, Frick, and Guertner, provided in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    “Art. 1\r\n\r\n    The National Socialist German Worker’s Party\r\n    (_National-Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei_) constitutes\r\n    the only political party in Germany.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 2\r\n\r\n    Whoever undertakes to maintain the organizational structure of\r\n    another political party or to form a new political party will be\r\n    punished with penal servitude up to three years or with\r\n    imprisonment of from six months to three years, if the deed is\r\n    not subject to a greater penalty according to other\r\n    regulations.” (_1388-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech on 6 July 1933 Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “The political parties have finally been abolished. This is a\r\n    historical occurrence, the meaning and implication of which one\r\n    cannot yet be fully conscious of. Now, we must set aside the\r\n    last vestige of democracy, particularly the methods of voting\r\n    and making majority decisions which today are used in local\r\n    governments, in economic organizations and in labor boards; in\r\n    its place we must validate the responsibility of the individual.\r\n    The achievement of external power must be followed by the\r\n    inner-education of the people * * *”\r\n\r\nLater in the same speech, Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “The Party has become the State. All power lies with the Reich\r\n    Authorities.” (_2632-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _The Nazi conspirators caused the Nazi Party to be established as a\r\npara-governmental organization with extensive and extraordinary\r\nprivileges._ On 1 December 1933 the Reich Cabinet promulgated a law\r\ndesigned for “Securing the Unity of Party and State”. It was signed by\r\nHitler and Frick, and provided:\r\n\r\n    “Art. 1\r\n\r\n    1. After the victory of the National Socialistic Revolution, the\r\n    National Socialistic German Labor Party is the bearer of the\r\n    concept of the German State and is inseparably the state.\r\n\r\n    2. It will be a part of the public law. Its organization will be\r\n    determined by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 2\r\n\r\n    The deputy of the Fuehrer and the Chief of Staff of the SA will\r\n    become members of the Reichs government in order to insure close\r\n    cooperation of the offices of the party and SA with the public\r\n    authorities.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 3\r\n\r\n    1. The members of the National Socialistic German Labor Party\r\n    and the SA (including their subordinate organizations) as the\r\n    leading and driving force of the National Socialist State will\r\n    bear greater responsibility toward Fuehrer, people and state.\r\n\r\n    2. In case they violate these duties, they will be subject to\r\n    special jurisdiction by party and state.\r\n\r\n    3. The Fuehrer may extend these regulations in order to include\r\n    members of other organizations.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 4\r\n\r\n    Every action or neglect on the part of members of the SA\r\n    (including their subordinate organizations) attacking or\r\n    endangering the existence, organization, activity or reputation\r\n    of the National Socialistic German Labor Party, in particular\r\n    any infraction against discipline and order, will be regarded as\r\n    a violation of duty.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 5\r\n\r\n    Custody and arrest may be inflicted in addition to the usual\r\n    penalties.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 6\r\n\r\n    The public authorities have to grant legal and administrative\r\n    assistance to the offices of the Party and the SA which are\r\n    entrusted with the execution of the jurisdiction of the Party\r\n    and SA.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 7\r\n\r\n    The law regarding the authority to inflict penalties on members\r\n    of the SA and SS, of the 28 April 1933 (RGBl, p. 230), will be\r\n    invalidated.\r\n\r\n    “Art. 8\r\n\r\n    The Reichs Chancellor, as Fuehrer of the National Socialistic\r\n    German Labor Party and as the supreme commander of SA will issue\r\n    the regulation necessary for the execution and augmentation of\r\n    this law, particularly with respect to the organization and\r\n    procedure of the Jurisdiction of the Party and SA. He will\r\n    determine the time at which the regulations concerning this\r\n    jurisdiction will be effective.” (_1395-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus the Nazi Party became a para-governmental organization in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators granted the Nazi Party and its components\r\nextensive and extraordinary privileges. On 19 May 1933, they passed a\r\nlaw to protect and insure respect for Party symbols (_2759-PS_). On 20\r\nDecember 1934 the Nazi conspirators caused a law to be promulgated,\r\nsigned by Hitler, Guertner, Hess, and Frick, making it a crime to make\r\nfalse or grievous statements to injure the prestige of the Government of\r\nthe Reich, the NSDAP, or its agencies. This law also declared it to be a\r\ncrime to wear the uniform or the insignia of the NSDAP without authority\r\nto do so, and controlled the manufacture and sale of Party uniforms,\r\nflags, and insignia (_1393-PS_). A decree of 29 March 1935, defining the\r\nlegal status of the NSDAP and of its components and affiliated\r\norganizations, is a further indication of the extraordinary privileges\r\nenjoyed by the Nazi Party.

CONSOLIDATION OF TOTALITARIAN POLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\n_Between the Accession to Power (early 1933) and the Outbreak of the War\r\n(late 1939) the Nazi Conspirators Consolidated Their Control of Germany\r\nby Utilizing and Molding Its Political Machinery to Their Own Ends._\r\n\r\nA. _The Nazi conspirators reduced the Reichstag to an impotent body of\r\ntheir own appointees._ Under the Weimar Constitution of the German\r\nReich, adopted by the German people on 11 August 1919, the Reichstag was\r\na representative parliamentary body with broad legislative powers.\r\nArticle 20 provided that the Reichstag should be “composed of the\r\ndelegates of the German people.” Article 68 of the Chapter on\r\nLegislation provided that:\r\n\r\n    “Bills are introduced by the government of the Reich or by\r\n    members of the Reichstag. Reich laws shall be enacted by the\r\n    Reichstag.” (_2050-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn _Mein Kampf_ Hitler stated the conspirators’ purpose to undermine the\r\nReichstag:\r\n\r\n    “Our young movement in essence and structure is\r\n    anti-parliamentarian, i.e., it rejects majority voting as a\r\n    matter of principle as well as in its own organization * * * Its\r\n    participation in the activities of a parliament has only the\r\n    purpose to contribute to its destruction, to the elimination of\r\n    an institution which we consider as one of the gravest symptoms\r\n    of decay of mankind * * *” (_2883-PS_).\r\n\r\nWith the passage of the Law for the Protection of the People and the\r\nReich (also known as the Enabling Act) the Nazi succeeded, in effect, in\r\ndepriving the Reichstag of its legislative functions. The legislative as\r\nwell as the executive powers of the government were concentrated in\r\nHitler and the Cabinet (_2001-PS_; the legislative activities of the\r\nCabinet (_Reichsregierung_) and its power to contravene constitutional\r\nlimitations are treated in Section 3 of Chapter XV).\r\n\r\nDuring the period from March 1933 until the beginning of 1937, the\r\nReichstag enacted only four laws: The Reconstruction Law of 30 January\r\n1934 and the three Nurnberg laws of 15 September 1935. The Reichstag was\r\nretained chiefly as a sounding board for Hitler’s speeches. All other\r\nlegislation was enacted by the Cabinet, by the Cabinet ministers, or by\r\ndecree of the Fuehrer (_2481-PS_). Hess has admitted the lack of\r\nimportance of the Reichstag in the legislative process after 1933.\r\n(_2426-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler indicated in a 1939 decree that the Reichstag would be permitted\r\nto enact only such laws as he, in his own judgment, might deem\r\nappropriate for Reichstag legislation. (_2018-PS_)\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Nazis acquired the control of the central\r\ngovernment they proceeded systematically to eliminate their opponents.\r\nFirst they forced all other political parties to dissolve, and on 14\r\nJuly 1933 issued a decree making illegal the existence of any political\r\nparty except the Nazi Party. (_1388-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn early 1935 there were 661 delegates in the Reichstag. Of this number\r\n641 were officially registered as Nazi party members and the remaining\r\n20 were classified as “guests” (_Gaeste_). (_2384-PS_; _2380-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Nazi conspirators curtailed the freedom of popular elections\r\nthroughout Germany._ Under the Weimar Republic there existed\r\nconstitutional and legislative guarantees of free popular elections. The\r\nWeimar Constitution guaranteed the universal, equal and secret ballot\r\nand proportional representation. (_2050-PS_) These general principles\r\nwere implemented by the provisions of the Reich Election Law of 1924,\r\nparticularly with respect to the multiple party system and the\r\nfunctioning of proportional representation. (_2382-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn _Mein Kampf_ Hitler stated the conspirators’ purpose to subvert the\r\nsystem of popular election:\r\n\r\n    “Majority can never replace men. * * * The political\r\n    understanding of the masses is not sufficiently developed to\r\n    produce independently specific political convictions and to\r\n    select persons to represent them.” (_2883-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe occasional national elections after 1933 were formalities devoid of\r\nfreedom of choice. Bona fide elections could not take place under the\r\nNazi system. The basic ideological doctrine of the _Fuehrerprinzip_\r\n(Leadership Principle) dictated that all subordinates must be appointed\r\nby their superiors in the governmental hierarchy. In order to insure the\r\npractical application of this principle the Nazis immediately liquidated\r\nall other political parties and provided criminal sanctions against the\r\nformation of new parties. (For further discussion see Section 2 on the\r\nAcquisition of Totalitarian Political Control.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the Reichstag, unlike all other elective assemblies in Germany,\r\nwas allowed to continue in existence, elections no longer involved a\r\nfree choice between lists or candidates. At these elections there were\r\nusually large bands of uniformed Nazis surrounding the polls and\r\nintimidating the voters. (_2955-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe surreptitious marking of ballots (e.g. with skimmed milk) was also\r\ncustomary, to ascertain the identity of the persons who cast “No” or\r\ninvalid votes. (_R-142_)\r\n\r\nAlthough it had already become practically impossible to have more than\r\none list of candidates, it was specifically provided by law in 1938 that\r\nonly one list was to be submitted to the electorate. (_2355-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy the end of this period, little of substance remained in the election\r\nlaw. In an official volume published during the war there are reprinted\r\nthe still effective provisions of the law of 1924. The majority of the\r\nsubstantive provisions have been marked “obsolete” (_gegenstandslos_)\r\n(_2381-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive Nazi program for the centralization of German\r\ngovernment included in its scope the whole system of regional and local\r\nelections, which soon ceased to exist. Article 17 of the Weimar\r\nConstitution had required a representative form of government and\r\nuniversal, secret elections in all Laender and municipalities\r\n(_2050-PS_). Yet in early 1934, the sovereign powers (_Hoheitsrechte_)\r\nof the Laender were transferred by law to the Reich and the Land\r\ngovernments were placed under the Reich control:\r\n\r\n    “The popular assemblies (_Volksvertretungen_) of the Laender\r\n    shall be abolished.” (_2006-PS_)\r\n\r\nPursuant to the German Communal Ordinance of 30 January 1935, the mayors\r\nand executive officers of all municipalities received their appointments\r\n“through the confidence of Party and State” (Article 6 (2)).\r\nAppointments were made by Reich authorities from lists prepared by the\r\nParty delegates (Article 41). City councillors were selected by the\r\nParty delegates in agreement with the mayors (Article 51 (1)).\r\n(_2008-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _The Nazi conspirators transformed the states, provinces, and\r\nmunicipalities into what were, in effect, mere administrative organs of\r\nthe central government._ Under the Weimar Constitution of the pre-Nazi\r\nregime, the states, provinces, and municipalities enjoyed considerable\r\nautonomy in the exercise of governmental functions—legislative,\r\nexecutive and judicial. (_2050-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler, in _Mein Kampf_, stated the conspirators’ purpose to establish\r\ntotalitarian control of local government:\r\n\r\n    “National Socialism, as a matter of principle, must claim the\r\n    right to enforce its doctrines, without regard to present\r\n    federal boundaries, upon the entire German nation and to educate\r\n    it in its ideas and its thinking. * * * The National Socialist\r\n    doctrine is not the servant of political interests of individual\r\n    federal states but shall become the ruler of the German nation.”\r\n    (_2883-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese views were echoed by Rosenberg:\r\n\r\n    “In the midst of the great power constellations of the globe\r\n    there must be, for foreign as well as for internal political\r\n    reasons, only one strong central national authority, if one\r\n    wants Germany to regain a position which makes it fit for\r\n    alliance with other countries.” (_2882-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy a series of laws and decrees, the Nazi conspirators reduced the\r\npowers of the regional and local governments and substantially\r\ntransformed them into territorial subdivisions of the Reich government.\r\nThe program of centralization began almost immediately after the Nazis\r\nacquired the chief executive posts of the government. On 31 March 1933,\r\nthey promulgated the Provisional Law integrating the Laender with the\r\nReich (_2004-PS_). This law called for the dissolution of all state and\r\nlocal self governing bodies and for their reconstitution according to\r\nthe number of votes cast for each party in the Reichstag election of 5\r\nMarch 1933. The Communists and their affiliates were expressly denied\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nA week later there followed the Second Law Integrating the Laender with\r\nthe Reich (_2005-PS_). This Act established the position of Reich\r\nGovernor. He was to be appointed by the President upon the proposal of\r\nthe Chancellor, and was given power to appoint the members of the Land\r\ngovernments and the higher Land officials and judges, the authority to\r\nreconstruct the Land legislature according to the law of 31 March 1933\r\n(_2004-PS_, _supra_), and the power of pardon.\r\n\r\nOn 31 January 1934, most of the remaining vestiges of Land independence\r\nwere destroyed by the Law for the Reconstruction of the Reich:\r\n\r\n    “The popular referendum and the Reichstag election of November\r\n    12, 1933, have proved that the German people have attained an\r\n    indestructible internal unity (_unloesliche innere Einheit_)\r\n    superior to all internal subdivisions of political character.\r\n    Consequently, the Reichstag has enacted the following law which\r\n    is hereby promulgated with the unanimous vote of the Reichstag\r\n    after ascertaining that the requirements of the Reich\r\n    Constitution have been met:\r\n\r\n    Article I. Popular assemblies of the Laender shall be abolished.\r\n\r\n    Article II. (1) The sovereign powers (_Hoheitsrechte_) of the\r\n    Laender are transferred to the Reich.\r\n\r\n    (2) The Laender governments are placed under the Reich\r\n    government.\r\n\r\n    Article III. The Reich governors are placed under the\r\n    administrative supervision of the Reich Minister of Interior.\r\n\r\n    Article IV. The Reich Government may issue new constitutional\r\n    laws.”\r\n\r\nThis law was implemented by a regulation, issued by Frick, providing\r\nthat all Land laws must have the assent of the competent Minister of the\r\nReich, that the highest echelons of the Land Government were to obey the\r\norders of the competent Reich Minister, and that the employees of the\r\nLaender might be transferred into the Reich Civil Service. (_1653-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Reichsrat_ (Reich Council) was abolished by law on 14 February\r\n1934, and all official representation on the part of the Laender in the\r\nadministration of the central government was at an end (_2647-PS_). The\r\nlegislative pattern was complete with the enactment of the Reich\r\nGovernor Law on 30 January 1935, which solidified the system of\r\ncentralized control. The Reich Governor was declared to be the official\r\nrepresentative of the Reich government, who was to receive orders\r\ndirectly from Hitler (_Reichstatthaltergesetz_ (Reich Governor Law), 30\r\nJanuary 1935, 1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, p. 65). The same\r\ndevelopment was apparent in the provinces, the territorial subdivisions\r\nof Prussia. All local powers were concentrated in the Provincial\r\nPresidents, who acted solely as representatives of the national\r\nadministration (_2049-PS_). Similarly, in the case of the municipalities\r\nlocal self-government was quickly reduced to a minimum and communal\r\naffairs were placed under central Reich control. The Nazi Party Delegate\r\nwas given special functions:\r\n\r\n    “* * * in order to insure harmony between the communal\r\n    administration and the Party.” (Art. 6 (2)).\r\n\r\nThe Reich was given supervision over the municipalities:\r\n\r\n    “* * * in order to insure that their activities conform with the\r\n    laws and the aims of national leadership.” (_2008-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators frequently boasted of their comprehensive program\r\nof government centralization. Frick, Minister of the Interior throughout\r\nthis period, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The reconstruction law abolished the sovereign rights and the\r\n    executive powers of the Laender and made the Reich the sole\r\n    bearer of the rights of sovereignty. The supreme powers of the\r\n    Laender do not exist any longer. The natural result of this was\r\n    the subordination of the Land governments to the Reich\r\n    government and the Land Ministers to the corresponding Reich\r\n    Ministers. On 30 January 1934, the German Reich became one\r\n    state. (_2481-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn another article Frick indicated even more clearly the purposes which\r\nunderlay this program of centralization:\r\n\r\n    “In the National Socialist revolution of 1933, it was stipulated\r\n    for the first time in the history of the German nation that the\r\n    erection of a unified state (_Einheitsstaat_) would be\r\n    accomplished. From the early days of his political activity,\r\n    Adolf Hitler never left a doubt in the mind of anyone that he\r\n    considered it the first duty of National Socialism to create a\r\n    German Reich in which the will of the people would be led in a\r\n    single direction and that the whole strength of the nation, _at\r\n    home and abroad_, would be placed on the balance scale.”\r\n    (_2380-PS_; _2378-PS_.)\r\n\r\nD. _The Nazi conspirators united the offices of President and Chancellor\r\nin the person of Hitler._ The merger of the two offices was accomplished\r\nby the law of 1 August 1934, signed by the entire cabinet (_2003-PS_).\r\nThe official Nazi statement concerning the effect of this statute\r\ncontains this observation:\r\n\r\n    “Through this law, the conduct of Party and State has been\r\n    combined in one hand. * * * He is responsible only to his own\r\n    conscience and to the German nation.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nOne of the significant consequences of this law was to give to Hitler\r\nthe supreme command of the German armed forces, always a prerequisite of\r\nthe Presidency (_2050-PS_). Accordingly, every soldier was immediately\r\nrequired to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler. (_2061-PS_)\r\n\r\nE. _The Nazi conspirators removed great numbers of civil servants on\r\nracial and political grounds and replaced them with party members and\r\nsupporters._\r\n\r\nHitler publicly announced the conspirators’ purpose:\r\n\r\n    “We know that two things alone will save us: the end of internal\r\n    corruption and the cleaning out of all those who owe their\r\n    existence simply to the protection of members of the same\r\n    political parties. Through the most brutal ruthlessness towards\r\n    all officials installed by those political parties we must\r\n    restore our finances. * * * The body of German officials must\r\n    once more become what it was.” (_2881-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi legislative machine turned to the task of purging the civil\r\nservice soon after the accession to power. On 7 April 1933, the Law for\r\nthe Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was promulgated\r\n(_1397-PS_). Article 3 of this law applies the Nazi blood theories:\r\n\r\n    “(1) Officials who are not of Aryan descent are to be retired\r\n    (See Section 8); where honorary officials are concerned, they\r\n    are to be discharged from office.\r\n\r\n    (2)  (1) Does not apply to officials who have been in service\r\n    since August 1, 1914, or who fought in the World War at the\r\n    front for the German Reich or for its allies or whose fathers or\r\n    sons were killed in the World War. The Reich Minister of the\r\n    Interior after consultation with the competent Minister or with\r\n    the highest state authorities may permit further exceptions in\r\n    the case of officials who are in foreign countries.”\r\n\r\nArticle 8 provides that retirement does not carry a pension unless the\r\nofficial has served at least ten years. The political purge provision of\r\nthis law is contained in Article 4:\r\n\r\n    “Officials who because of their previous political activity do\r\n    not offer security that they will exert themselves for the\r\n    national state without reservations, may be discharged. For\r\n    three months after dismissal, they will be paid their former\r\n    salary. From this time on they receive three-quarters of their\r\n    pensions (see 8) and corresponding annuities for their heirs.”\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Act apply to all Reich, Land, and Communal\r\nofficials (Art. 1 (2)). Civil Servants may be placed on the retired list\r\nwithout any reason, “for the purpose of simplifying the administration”\r\n(Art. 6). Discharges and transfers, once decided on by the appropriate\r\nadministrative chief, are final and are not subject to appeal (Art. 7\r\n(1)).\r\n\r\nThis basic enactment was followed by a series of decrees, regulations,\r\nand amendments. For example, on 11 April 1933, the term “non-Aryan” was\r\ndefined to include persons with only one non-Aryan grandparent\r\n(_2012-PS_). An amendatory law of 30 June ruled out all civil servants\r\nmarried to non-Aryans. (_1400-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe political standards of the “Purge Law” were made more explicit by\r\nthe supplementary law of 20 July 1933. Officials who belonged to any\r\nparty or organization which, in the opinion of the Nazis, furthered the\r\naims of Communism, Marxism, or Social Democracy were summarily to be\r\ndischarged (_1398-PS_). In the later years, these earlier provisions\r\nwere enlarged and codified, no longer solely for the purposes of\r\naffecting the existing civil service, but rather to set out the\r\nqualifications for the appointment of new applicants and for their\r\npromotion. Proof of devotion to National Socialism and documentary proof\r\nof acceptable “blood” were prescribed as conditions to promotion.\r\n(_2326-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive German Civil Service Law of 26 January 1937 included\r\nthe discriminatory provisions of the earlier legislation, and prevented\r\nthe appointment of any applicants opposed or suspected of being opposed\r\nto the Nazi program and policy (_2340-PS_). The legislation dealing with\r\nthe training and education of civil servants provided that no person can\r\nbe accepted for an official position unless he is a member of the Nazi\r\nParty or one of its formations (_Gliederungen_). (_2341-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe total subjugation of the German civil servant was ultimately\r\naccomplished by the following resolution passed by the Reichstag at the\r\nrequest of the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “* * * without being bound by existing legal provisions, the\r\n    Fuehrer must therefore in his capacity as Fuehrer of the nation,\r\n    as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, as Head of the\r\n    Government and as the highest bearer of all power, as highest\r\n    Law Lord and as Fuehrer of the Party, always be in a position to\r\n    require every German—whether a simple soldier or officer,\r\n    subordinate or higher official, or judge, supervisory or\r\n    operating functionary of the Party, laborer or employer—to\r\n    carry out his duties with all the means available to him and to\r\n    discharge these duties according to a conscientious examination\r\n    without reference to so-called vested rights, especially without\r\n    the preambles of pre-existing procedure, by removal of any man\r\n    from his office, rank or position.” (_2755-PS_)\r\n\r\nF. _The Nazi conspirators restricted the independence of the judiciary\r\nand rendered it subservient to their ends._\r\n\r\nThe independence of judges, before the Nazi regime, was guaranteed by\r\nthe Weimar Constitution. The fundamental principle was stated briefly in\r\nArticle 102:\r\n\r\n    “Judges are independent and subject only to the law.”\r\n    (_2050-PS_)\r\n\r\nArticle 104 contained a safeguard against the arbitrary removal or\r\nsuspension of judges, while Article 105 prohibited “exceptional courts”.\r\nThe fundamental rights of the individual are set out in Article 109 and\r\ninclude equality before the law. (_2050-PS_)\r\n\r\nLike all other public officials, German judges who failed to meet Nazi\r\nracial and political requirements became the subject of a wide-spread\r\npurge. Non-Aryans, political opponents of the Nazis, and all persons\r\nsuspected of antagonism to the aims of the Party were summarily removed\r\n(_2967-PS_). The provisions of the Law for the Restoration of\r\nProfessional Civil Service of 7 April 1933 applied to all judges. This\r\nwas declared expressly in the third regulation for the administration of\r\nthe law. (_2867-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo make certain that cases with political ramifications would be dealt\r\nwith acceptably and in conformity with Party principles, the Nazis\r\ngranted designated areas of criminal jurisdiction to the so-called\r\nSpecial Courts (_Sondergerichte_). These constituted a new system of\r\nspecial criminal courts, independent of the regular judiciary and\r\ndirectly subservient to the Party (_2076-PS_). A later decree\r\nconsiderably broadened the jurisdiction of these courts. (_2056-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1934, the People’s Court was set up as a trial court “in cases of\r\nhigh treason and treason” (_2014-PS_). This action was a direct, result\r\nof the dissatisfaction of the Nazi rulers with the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court (_Reichsgericht_) in the Reichstag fire trial. Three of\r\nthe four defendants were acquitted although the Nazi conspirators had\r\nexpected convictions in all cases (_2967-PS_). The law which created\r\nthis new tribunal contained a wide definition of treason which would\r\ninclude most of what were regarded by the Nazis as “political” crimes\r\n(Art. 3 (1)). The express denial of any appeal from the decisions of the\r\nPeople’s Court (Art. 5 (2)) was a further indication of the intention of\r\nthe Nazis to set up a criminal law system totally outside of accepted\r\njudicial pattern. The substantive organization of the People’s Court was\r\nlater established by law in 1936. (_2342-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese new tribunals were staffed almost exclusively with Nazis and were\r\nused to tighten the Party’s grip on Germany. This control became\r\nprogressively stronger, due first, to the power of the prosecutor to\r\npick the appropriate court; second, to the restriction of defense\r\ncounsel in these courts to specially admitted attorneys; and finally, to\r\nthe absence of appeal from the decisions of these judges. Moreover,\r\nthere developed along side of the entire judicial system the\r\nincreasingly powerful police administration, under which persons opposed\r\nto the regime were regularly imprisoned in concentration camps without\r\nany type of hearing, even after acquittal by the courts. (_2967-PS_)\r\n\r\nStill another group of courts was established within the Party itself.\r\nThese Party Courts heard cases involving internal party discipline and\r\ninfractions of the rules of conduct prescribed for members of formations\r\nand affiliated organizations. The published rules for the Party judges\r\nemphasized the complete dependence of these judges upon the directions\r\nand supervision of their Party superiors. (_2402-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi legal theorists freely admitted that there was no place in\r\ntheir scheme of things for the truly independent judge. They controlled\r\nall judges through special directives and orders from the central\r\ngovernment. Frank underscored the role of the judge as a political\r\nfunctionary and as an administrator in the National Socialist state\r\n(_2378-PS_). Two case histories of this period serve to illustrate the\r\nmanner in which criminal proceedings were directly suppressed or\r\notherwise affected by order of the Reich government.\r\n\r\nIn 1935, the Reich Governor of Saxony, Mutschmann, attempted to quash\r\ncriminal proceedings which, in this exceptional instance, had been\r\nbrought against officials of the Hohnstein concentration camp for a\r\nseries of extremely brutal attacks upon inmates. The trial was held and\r\nthe defendants convicted, but during the trial the governor inquired of\r\nthe presiding judge whether he did not think the penalty proposed by the\r\nprosecutor too severe and whether an acquittal was not indicated. After\r\nthe conviction, two jurymen were ousted from the NSDAP and the\r\nprosecutor was advised by his superior to withdraw from the SA. Although\r\nGuertner, the then Minister of Justice, strongly recommended against\r\ntaking any action to alter the decision, Hitler pardoned all the\r\naccused. (_783-PS_; _784-PS_; _785-PS_; _786-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn another similar case, Guertner wrote directly to Hitler narrating the\r\nhorrible details of maltreatment and advising that the case be regularly\r\nprosecuted. Nevertheless, Hitler ordered complete suppression of the\r\nproceedings. (_787-PS_; _788-PS_)\r\n\r\nUnder the Nazi regime, it was part of the official duty of many Party\r\nfunctionaries to supervise the administration of justice. The official\r\npapers of Hess contain detailed statements concerning his own functions\r\nand those of the Gauleiter in deciding criminal cases. (_2639-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother type of governmental interference in judicial matters is\r\nevidenced by the confidential letter which the Ministry of Justice sent\r\nin early 1938 to the Chief Justices of the Regional Supreme Courts\r\n(_Oberlandesgerichtspraesidenten_). The judges were instructed to submit\r\nlists of lawyers who would be sufficiently able and trustworthy to\r\nrepresent in court persons who had been taken into “protective custody”.\r\nThe main requirement was absolute political reliability. Simple Party\r\nmembership was not enough; to be selected, the lawyer had to enjoy the\r\nconfidence of the “Gestapo”. (_651-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter the war began, Thierack, Minister of Justice, revealed the low\r\nstate to which the judiciary had fallen under Nazi rule. He argued that\r\nthe judge was not the “supervisor” but the “assistant” of the\r\ngovernment. He said that the word “independent”, as applied to the\r\njudge, was to be eliminated from the vocabulary and that although the\r\njudge should retain a certain freedom of decision in particular cases,\r\nthe government “can and must” give him the “general line” to follow. For\r\nthis purpose, Thierack decided in 1942 to send confidential Judge’s\r\nLetters (_Richterbriefe_) to all German judges and prosecutors, setting\r\nforth the political principles and directives with which all judicial\r\npersonnel were obligated to comply (_2482-PS_). The first of these\r\nJudge’s Letters clearly expresses the complete subordination of the\r\njudges to the Fuehrer and his government. (_D-229_)\r\n\r\nG. _The Nazi conspirators greatly enlarged existing State and Party\r\norganizations and established an elaborate network of new formations and\r\nagencies._\r\n\r\nThe totalitarian character of the Nazi regime led to the establishment\r\nof a great number of new official and semi-official agencies and\r\norganizations in the various fields of life which were permeated by Nazi\r\ndoctrine and practice, including culture, trade, industry, and\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nNew agencies had to be created to handle the large number of additional\r\nadministrative tasks taken over from the Laender and the municipalities.\r\nMoreover, the mobilization of the political, economic, and military\r\nresources of Germany required the formation of such coordinating\r\n“super-agencies” as the Four Year Plan, the Plenipotentiary for\r\nEconomics, the Plenipotentiary for Administration, and the Ministerial\r\nCouncil for the Defense of the Reich. At the time of the launching of\r\nwar, the central Reich government was an extremely complicated structure\r\nheld together under strict Nazi dictatorship. (See _Chart Number 18_;\r\nalso _2261-PS_; _2194-PS_; _2018-PS_.)\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, in the Party, the growth of agencies and organizations\r\nproceeded rapidly. The Party spread, octopus-like, throughout all\r\nGermany and into many foreign lands. (See _Chart Number 1_; also\r\n_1725-PS_.)\r\n\r\nThis process of growth was summed up late in 1937 in an official\r\nstatement of the Party Chancellery:\r\n\r\n“In order to control the whole German nation in all spheres of life, the\r\nNSDAP, after assuming power, set up under its leadership the new Party\r\nformations and affiliated organizations.” (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nH. _The Nazi conspirators created a dual system of government controls,\r\nset up Party agencies to correspond with State agencies, and coordinated\r\ntheir activities, often by uniting corresponding State and Party offices\r\nin a single person._\r\n\r\nIn _Mein Kampf_, Hitler announced the conspirators’ purpose:\r\n\r\n    “Such a revolution can and will only be achieved by a movement\r\n    which itself is already organized in the spirit of such ideas\r\n    and thus in itself already bears the coming state. Therefore,\r\n    the National Socialist movement may today become imbued with\r\n    these ideas and put them into practice in its own organization\r\n    so that it not only may direct the state according to the same\r\n    principles, but also may be in a position to put at the state’s\r\n    disposal the finished organizational structure of its own\r\n    state.” (_2883-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazis attempted to achieve a certain degree of identity between the\r\nParty and the State and, at the same time, to maintain two separate\r\norganizational structures. After the rise to power, the fundamental\r\nprinciple of unity was translated into “law”:\r\n\r\n    “Article 1. After the victory of the National Socialistic\r\n    Revolution, the National Socialistic German Labor Party is the\r\n    bearer of the concept of the German State and is inseparably the\r\n    state.” (_1395-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Nazis retained a duality of organization despite\r\nthe theory of unity is graphically portrayed in the charts of the Party\r\nand the State (_Charts Number 1 and 18_). These visual exhibits\r\ndemonstrate the comprehensive character of the Party organization, which\r\nwas established on parallel lines with the corresponding government\r\nstructure. The Party structure remained at all times technically\r\nseparate and could be used for non-governmental purposes whenever such\r\nuse best served the needs of the conspirators. In innumerable instances,\r\nthe corresponding Party and State offices were, in fact, held by the\r\nsame person. For example, the Gauleiter of the Party in most instances\r\nalso held the post of Reich Governor (or, in Prussia, that of Provincial\r\nPresident). (_2880-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe coordination of the Party and State functions started at the top.\r\nThe Chief of the Party Chancellery was designated a Reich Minister and\r\nendowed with plenary powers in the preparation and approval of\r\nlegislation. He acted as liaison officer at the highest level between\r\nParty officials and cabinet ministers. He was given also the duty of\r\npassing on the appointment of all the more important civil servants.\r\n(_2787-PS_)\r\n\r\nMany of the same powers were bestowed upon the other _Reichsleiter_\r\n(Leaders composing the Party Directorate). The official Nazi exposition\r\nof their position is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “It is in the Reich Directorate where the strings of the\r\n    organization of the German people and the State meet. By\r\n    endowment of the Chief of the Party Chancellery with the powers\r\n    of a Reich Minister, and by special administrative directives,\r\n    the penetration of the State apparatus with the political will\r\n    of the Party is guaranteed. It is the task of the separate\r\n    organs of the Reich Directorate to maintain as close a contact\r\n    as possible with the life of the nation through their\r\n    sub-offices in the Gaus. Observations at the front are to be\r\n    collected and exploited by the offices of the Reich\r\n    Directorate.” (_1893-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the regional and local levels, the _Gauleiter_, _Kreisleiter_, etc.,\r\nwere also empowered to control the purely governmental authorities on\r\npolitical matters. Hess issued the following order shortly after the war\r\nbegan:\r\n\r\n    “I, therefore order that the bearer of sovereignty\r\n    (_Hoheitstraeger_) of the NSDAP (_Gauleiter_, _Kreisleiter_,\r\n    _Ortsgruppenleiter_) in the scope of his authority is\r\n    responsible for the political leadership and the frame of mind\r\n    (_Stimmung_) of the population. It is his right and his duty to\r\n    take or to cause to be taken any measures necessary for the\r\n    expeditious fulfillment of his political duties and for the\r\n    elimination of wrong within the Party. He is exclusively\r\n    responsible to his superior bearers of sovereignty\r\n    (_Hoheitstraeger_).” (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the later years, the functional coordination of Party and State\r\noffices became much more common. The appointment of Himmler as\r\nReichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police is a typical example of\r\nthe way in which State and Party functions became inextricably merged so\r\nas to render any clean lines of demarcation impossible.

PURGE OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND TERRORIZATION\r\n\r\nA. _The Nazi conspirators ruthlessly purged their political opponents._\r\nSoon after the Nazi conspirators had acquired political control, the\r\ndefendant Goering, 3 March 1933, stated:\r\n\r\n    “Fellow Germans, my measures will not be crippled by any\r\n    judicial thinking. My measures will not be crippled by any\r\n    bureaucracy. Here, I don’t have to give justice, my mission is\r\n    only to destroy and exterminate, nothing more! This struggle,\r\n    fellow Germans, will be a struggle against chaos and such a\r\n    struggle, I shall not conduct with the power of any police. A\r\n    bourgeoise state might have done that. Certainly, I shall use\r\n    the power of the State and the police to the utmost, my dear\r\n    Communists! So you won’t draw any false conclusions; but the\r\n    struggle to the death, in which my fist will grasp your necks, I\r\n    shall lead with those down there—those are the Brown Shirts.”\r\n    (_1856-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1934 Heinrich Himmler, the Deputy Leader of the Prussian Secret State\r\nPolice, stated:\r\n\r\n    “We are confronted with a very pressing duty—both the open and\r\n    secret enemies of the Fuehrer and of the National Socialist\r\n    movement and of our National Revolution must be discovered,\r\n    combatted and exterminated. In this duty we are agreed to spare\r\n    neither our own blood nor the blood of anyone else when it is\r\n    required by our country.” (_2543-PS_)\r\n\r\nRaymond H. Geist, former American Counsel and First Secretary of the\r\nEmbassy in Berlin, Germany 1929-1939, has stated:\r\n\r\n    “Immediately in 1933, the concentration camps were established\r\n    and put under charge of the Gestapo. Only ‘political’ prisoners\r\n    were held in concentration camps * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The first wave of terroristic acts began in March 6-13, 1933,\r\n    accompanied by unusual mob violence. When the Nazi Party won the\r\n    elections in March 1933—on the morning of the 6th—the\r\n    accumulated passion blew off in wholesale attacks on the\r\n    Communists, Jews, and others suspected of being either. Mobs of\r\n    SA men roamed the streets, beating up, looting, and even killing\r\n    persons * * *.\r\n\r\n    “For Germans taken into custody by the Gestapo * * * there was a\r\n    regular pattern of brutality and terror. Victims numbered in the\r\n    hundreds of thousands all over Germany.” (_1759-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Sturmabteilung (SA) had plans for the murder of former Prime\r\nMinister Bruening, but his life was spared through the negotiations and\r\nactivities of the defendant Hess and Dr. Haushofer, President of the\r\nGeopolitic Institute of Munich, because they feared his death might\r\nresult in serious repercussions abroad. (_1669-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrom March until October 1933 the Nazi conspirators arrested, mistreated\r\nand killed numerous politicians, Reichstag members, authors, physicians,\r\nand lawyers. Among the persons killed were the Social Democrat Stolling;\r\nErnst Heilman, Social Democrat and member of the Prussian Parliament;\r\nOtto Eggerstadt, the former Police President of Altona; and various\r\nother persons. The people killed by the Nazis belonged to various\r\npolitical parties and religious faiths, such as Democrats, Catholics,\r\nCommunists, Jews, and pacifists. The killings were usually camouflaged\r\nby such utterances as “killed in attempting to escape” or “resisting\r\narrest.” It is estimated that during this first wave of terror conducted\r\nby the Nazi conspirators, between 500 and 700 persons died. (_2544-PS_;\r\nsee also _2460-PS_ and _2472-PS_.)\r\n\r\nOn 30 June, and 1, 2 July 1934, the Nazi conspirators proceeded to\r\ndestroy opposition within their own ranks by wholesale murder\r\n(_2545-PS_). In making a formal report of these murders to the Reichstag\r\non 13 July 1934, Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “The punishment for these crimes was hard and severe. There were\r\n    shot 19 higher SA leaders, 31 SA leaders and SA members and also\r\n    3 SS leaders as participants in the plot. Also 13 SA leaders and\r\n    civilians who tried to resist arrest and were killed in the\r\n    attempt. 3 others committed suicide. 5 members of the Party who\r\n    were not members of the SA were shot because of their\r\n    participation. Finally, 3 SS members were at the same time\r\n    exterminated because they had maltreated concentration camp\r\n    inmates.” (_2572-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn this same speech, Hitler proudly boasted that he gave the order to\r\nshoot the principal traitors and that he had prosecuted thousands of his\r\nformer enemies on account of their corruption. He justified this action\r\nby saying,\r\n\r\n    “In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German\r\n    people.” (_Voelkischer Beobachter (People’s Observer), Berlin\r\n    ed., issue 195, 14 July 1934, Beiblatt, p. 2._)\r\n\r\nThe conspirators took advantage of this occasion to eliminate many\r\nopponents indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the Roehm purge, the defendant Frick stated:\r\n\r\n    “On account of this order, many, many people were arrested * * *\r\n    something like a hundred, even more, were even killed who were\r\n    accused of high treason. All of this was done without resort to\r\n    legal proceedings. They were just killed on the spot. Many\r\n    people were killed—I don’t know how many—who actually did not\r\n    have anything to do with the putsch. People who just weren’t\r\n    liked very well, as, for instance, SCHLEICHER, the former Reich\r\n    Chancellor, were killed. SCHLEICHER’s wife was also killed as\r\n    was GREGOR STRASSER, who had been the Reich organization leader\r\n    and second man in the Party after Hitler. STRASSER, at the time\r\n    he was murdered, was not active in political affairs anymore.\r\n    However, he had separated himself from the Fuehrer in November\r\n    or December of 1932.” (_2950-PS_)\r\n\r\nSuch a large scale of extermination could not be carried out without\r\nerrors. Shortly after the event, the Nazi conspirators arranged for a\r\nGovernment pension to be paid to one of its citizens, because “by\r\nmistake” the political police had murdered her husband, Willi Schmidt,\r\nwho had never engaged in any kind of political activity. It was believed\r\nat the time that the man intended was Willi Schmidt, an SA leader in\r\nMunich, who was later shot on the same day. (_L-135_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators formally endorsed their murderous purge within\r\ntheir own ranks by causing the Reichstag to pass a law declaring that\r\nall measures taken in carrying out the purge on 30 June and 1-2 July\r\n1934 were legal as a measure of State necessity (_2057-PS_). Referring\r\nto this act of approval on the part of the Nazi-controlled Reichstag,\r\nGoering stated:\r\n\r\n    “The action of the Government in the days of the Roehm revolt\r\n    was the highest realization of the legal consciousness of the\r\n    people. Later the action which itself was justified, now has\r\n    been made legal by the passage of a law.” (_2496-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the leader of the Nazi conspiracy on 25 July 1934 issued a\r\ndecree which stated that because of the meritorious service of the SS,\r\nespecially in connection with the events of 30 June 1934, the\r\norganization was elevated to the standing of an independent organization\r\nwithin the NSDAP. (_1857-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Nazi conspirators used the legislative and judicial powers of\r\nthe German Reich to terrorize all political opponents._\r\n\r\n(1) _They created a great number of new political crimes._ The decree of\r\n28 February 1933 punished the inciting of disobedience to orders given\r\nout by State or Reich Government authorities or the provocation of acts\r\n“contrary to public welfare.” (_1390-PS_) A month later, in order to\r\ngive themselves legal justification for murdering by judicial process\r\ntheir political enemies, the Nazi conspirators passed a law making the\r\nprovisions of the above decree applicable retroactively to acts\r\ncommitted during the period from 31 January to 28 February 1933.\r\n(_2554-PS_)\r\n\r\nReferring to these laws, the defendant Goering stated:\r\n\r\n    “Whoever in the future raises a hand against a representative of\r\n    the National Socialist movement or of the State, must know that\r\n    he will lose his life in a very short while. Furthermore, it\r\n    will be entirely sufficient, if he is proven to have intended\r\n    the act, or, if the act results not in a death, but only in an\r\n    injury.” (_2494-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 21 March 1933 a decree was issued which provided for penitentiary\r\nimprisonment up to two years for possessing a uniform of an organization\r\nsupporting the government of the Nationalist movement without being\r\nentitled thereto, or circulating a statement which was untrue or greatly\r\nexaggerated, or which was apt to seriously harm the welfare of the Reich\r\nor the reputation of the Government, or of the Party or organizations\r\nsupporting the Government. (_1652-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators caused a law to be enacted punishing whoever\r\nundertook to maintain or form a political party other than the NSDAP.\r\n(_1388-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators enacted a law which made it a crime deliberately\r\nto make false or grave statements calculated to injure the welfare or\r\nthe prestige of the Reich, or to circulate a statement manifesting a\r\nmalicious or low-minded attitude toward leading personalities of the\r\nState or the Party. The law also applied to statements of this kind\r\nwhich were not made in public, provided the offender counted on his\r\nstatements being eventually circulated in public. (_1393-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn commenting on the above law, one of the leading Nazi conspirators,\r\nMartin Bormann, stated:\r\n\r\n    “Although it must absolutely be prevented that martyrs are\r\n    created, one must take merciless action against such people, in\r\n    whose attacks a bad character or attitude, decisively inimical\r\n    to the State, can be recognized. For this purpose, I request the\r\n    Gauleiters to report here briefly all crimes, which must\r\n    absolutely be punished, and which have become known to the\r\n    districts, regardless of the report to be made to the district\r\n    attorney’s office * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The district and local leaderships are to be notified\r\n    accordingly. However, if it should be decided from wherein this\r\n    or that punishable case, that the miscreant is to be given a\r\n    simple or strong reprimand by the court, I shall give the\r\n    directive for the future, that the Districts are informed of the\r\n    names of the persons.\r\n\r\n    “I therefore request, to see to it, that these compatriots be\r\n    especially watched by the Ortsgruppen, and that it be attempted,\r\n    to influence them in the National Socialist sense. Otherwise, it\r\n    will be necessary to place the activities of such persons, who\r\n    do not want to be taught, under exact control. In these cases,\r\n    it will eventually be necessary, to notify the Secret State\r\n    Police.” (_2639-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 24 April 1934 the Nazi conspirators passed a law imposing the death\r\npenalty for “any treasonable act.” Included in the law was a declaration\r\nto the effect that the creating or organizing of a political party, or\r\ncontinuing of an existing one was a treasonable act. (_2548-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _By their interpretation and changes of the penal law, the Nazi\r\nconspirators enlarged their terroristic methods._ After the enactment of\r\nthese new political crimes, the Nazi conspirators introduced into the\r\npenal law the theory of punishment by analogy. This enabled them legally\r\nto punish any act injurious to their political interests even if no\r\nexisting statute forbade it. The culpability of the act and the\r\npunishment was determined by the law most closely relating to or\r\ncovering the act which was in force at the time. (_1962-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn interpreting this law, Dr. Guertner, Reich Minister of Justice,\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “National Socialism substitutes for the idea of formal wrong,\r\n    the idea of factual wrong. * * * Even without the threat of\r\n    punishment, every violation of the goals toward which the\r\n    community is striving is a wrong per se. As a result, the law\r\n    ceases to be an exclusive source for the determination of right\r\n    or wrong.” (_2549-PS_)\r\n\r\nReferring to the penal code of Nazi Germany, the defendant Frank stated\r\nin 1935:\r\n\r\n    “The National Socialist State is a totalitarian State, it makes\r\n    no concessions to criminals, it does not negotiate with them; it\r\n    stamps them out.” (_2552-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators also revised the criminal law so that the State\r\ncould, within one year after a decree in a criminal case had become\r\nfinal, apply for a new trial, and the application would be decided by\r\nmembers of a Special Penal Chamber appointed by Hitler personally. Thus,\r\nif a defendant should be acquitted in a lower court, the Nazi\r\nconspirators could rectify the situation by another trial. (_2550-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn direct contrast to the severity of the criminal law as it affected\r\nthe general population of Germany, the Nazi conspirators adopted and\r\nendorsed a large body of unwritten laws exempting the police from\r\ncriminal liability for illegal acts done under higher authority. This\r\nprinciple was described by Dr. Werner Best, outstanding Nazi lawyer, in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\n    “The police never act in a lawless or illegal manner as long as\r\n    they act according to the rules laid down by their superiors up\r\n    to the highest governing body. According to its nature, the\r\n    police must only deal with what the Government wants to know is\r\n    being dealt with. What the Government wants to know is being\r\n    dealt with by the police is the essence of the police law and is\r\n    that which guides and restricts the actions of the police. As\r\n    long as the police carry out the will of the Government, it is\r\n    acting legally.” (_1852-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _The Nazi conspirators created a vast system of espionage into the\r\ndaily lives of all parts of the population._\r\n\r\n(1) _They destroyed the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic\r\ncommunications._ They enacted a law in February of 1933 providing that\r\nviolations of privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic\r\ncommunications were permissible beyond legal limitations. (_1390-PS_)\r\n\r\nDr. Hans Anschuetz, the present District Court Director\r\n(_Landgerichtsdirektor_) at Heidelberg, Germany, recently stated:\r\n\r\n    “Subsequently, the system of spying upon and supervising the\r\n    political opinions of each citizen which permeated the entire\r\n    people and private life of Germany, was, of course, also\r\n    extended to judges.” (_2967-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _They used the Secret State Police (Gestapo) and the Security\r\nService (SD) for the purpose of maintaining close surveillance over the\r\ndaily activities of all people in Germany._ The Gestapo had as its\r\nprimary preventive activity the thorough observation of all enemies of\r\nthe State, in the territory of the Reich. (_1956-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SD was an intelligence organization which operated out of various\r\nregional offices. It consisted of many hundreds of professional SD\r\nmembers who were assisted by thousands of honorary members and\r\ninformers. These people were placed in all fields of business,\r\neducation, State and Party administration, and frequently performed\r\ntheir duties secretly in their own organization. This information\r\nservice reported on the activities of the people. (_2614-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _Without judicial process, the Nazi conspirators imprisoned, held in\r\nprotective custody and sent to concentration camps opponents and\r\nsuspected opponents._\r\n\r\n_They authorized the Gestapo to arrest and detain without recourse to\r\nany legal proceeding._ Officially, this power was described as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Secret State Police takes the necessary police preventive\r\n    measures against the enemies of the State on the basis of the\r\n    results of the observation. The most effective preventive\r\n    measure is without doubt the withdrawal of freedom which is\r\n    covered in the form of protective custody. * * * While\r\n    protective arrests of short duration are carried out in police\r\n    and court prisons, the concentration camps under the Secret\r\n    State Police admit those taken into protective custody who have\r\n    to be withdrawn from public life for a longer time.” (_1956-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators issued their own orders for the taking of people\r\ninto protective custody and these orders set forth no further details\r\nconcerning the reasons therefor, except a statement such as “Suspicion\r\nof activities inimical toward the State.” (_2499-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe defendant Frank stated:\r\n\r\n    “To the world we are blamed again and again because of the\r\n    concentration camps. We are asked, ‘Why do you arrest without a\r\n    warrant of arrest?’ I say, put yourselves into the position of\r\n    our nation. Don’t forget that the very great and still untouched\r\n    world of Bolshevism cannot forget that we have made final\r\n    victory for them impossible in Europe, right here on German\r\n    soil.” (_2533-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe defendant Goering said in 1934:\r\n\r\n    “Against the enemies of the State, we must proceed ruthlessly.\r\n    It cannot be forgotten that at the moment of our rise to power,\r\n    according to the official election figures of March 1933, six\r\n    million people still confess their sympathy for Communism and\r\n    eight million for Marxism. * * * _Therefore, the concentration\r\n    camps have been created, where we have first confined thousands\r\n    of Communists and Social Democrat functionaries._ * * *”\r\n    (_2344-PS_)\r\n\r\nU. S. Ambassador George S. Messersmith, former Counsel General in\r\nBerlin, Germany, 1930-34, and Raymond H. Geist, former American Counsel\r\nand First Secretary of the Embassy in Berlin, Germany, 1929-1939, have\r\nrecently stated:\r\n\r\n    “Independent of individual criminal acts committed by high\r\n    functionaries of the German government or the Nazi Party, such\r\n    as the murders ordered by Hitler, Himmler and Goering, all high\r\n    functionaries of the German government and of the Nazi Party * *\r\n    * are guilty in the highest degree of complicity in and\r\n    furtherance of the cardinal crimes of oppression against the\r\n    German people, persecution and destruction of the Jews and all\r\n    of their political opponents.” (_2386-PS_)\r\n\r\nCommenting further on the Nazi conspirators’ use of concentration camps\r\nto destroy political opposition, Raymond H. Geist stated:\r\n\r\n    “The German people were well acquainted with the goings on in\r\n    concentration camps and it was well known that the fate of\r\n    anyone too actively opposed to any part of the Nazi program was\r\n    liable to be one of great suffering. Indeed, before the Hitler\r\n    regime was many months old, almost every family in Germany had\r\n    had first-hand accounts of the brutalities inflicted in the\r\n    concentration camps from someone either in the relationship or\r\n    in the circle of friends who had served a sentence there;\r\n    consequently the fear of such camps was a very effective brake\r\n    on any possible opposition.” (_1759-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators confined, under the guise of “protective custody”\r\nReichstag members, Social Democrats, Communists, and other opponents or\r\nsuspected opponents. (_2544-PS_; _L-73_; _L-83_; _1430-PS_.)\r\n\r\nE. _The Nazi conspirators created and utilized special agencies for\r\ncarrying out their system of terror._\r\n\r\n(See Chapter XV, Sections 5 and 6, on the Gestapo, SS, and SD)\r\n\r\nF. _The Nazi conspirators permitted organizations and individuals to\r\ncarry out this system of terror without restraint of law._\r\n\r\n(1) _Acts of the Gestapo were not subject to review by the courts._ In\r\n1935 the Prussian Supreme Court of Administration held that the orders\r\nof the Gestapo were not subject to judicial review; and that the accused\r\nperson could appeal only to the next higher authority within the State\r\nPolice itself. (_2347-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1936 a law was passed concerning The Gestapo in Prussia which\r\nprovided that orders in matters of the Gestapo were not subject to\r\nreview of the Administrative Courts. (_2107-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the same subject, the following article appeared in the official\r\nGerman Lawyer’s Journal, 1935.\r\n\r\n    “Once again the court had to decide on the question of whether\r\n    political measures could be subjected to the review of the\r\n    ordinary courts. * * * The case in question concerned the\r\n    official performance of his duty by an official of the NSDAP. *\r\n    * * The principle of the importance and the mission of the Party\r\n    and its ‘Sovereign Functionaires’ cannot be overlooked.\r\n    Therefore, the plaintiff should have been denied the right to be\r\n    in court.” (_2491-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Where no definite law protected terroristic acts of Nazi\r\nconspirators and their accomplices, proceedings against them were in the\r\nfirst instance suppressed or thereafter their acts were pardoned._ In\r\n1935, proceedings against an employee of the Gestapo accused of\r\ntorturing, beating, and killing of inmates of a concentration camp were\r\nsuppressed (_787-PS_; _788-PS_).

DESTRUCTION OF THE FREE TRADE UNIONS AND\r\n                     ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OVER THE\r\n                        PRODUCTIVE LABOR CAPACITY\r\n\r\nA. _They destroyed the independent organization of German labor._\r\n\r\n(1) _Before the Nazis took control, organized labor held a well\r\nestablished and influential position in Germany._ Most of the trade\r\nunions of Germany were joined together in two large congresses or\r\nfederations, the Free Trade Unions (_Freie Gewerkschaften_) and\r\nChristian Trade Unions (_Christlichen Gewerkschaften_). Unions outside\r\nthese two large groupings contained only 15 per cent of the total union\r\nmembership. The Free Trade Unions were a congress of two federations of\r\naffiliated unions: (1) the General German Trade Union Federation\r\n(_Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbund_, or the “ADGB”) with 28\r\naffiliated unions of industrial workers; (2) the General Independent\r\nEmployees Federation (_Allgemeinen Freien Angestelltenbund_, or the\r\n“AFA”) with 13 affiliated unions of white collar workers. (_392-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe membership of the Free Trade Unions, the affiliated organizations of\r\nthe Christian Trade Unions, and all other unions at the end of 1931 (the\r\nlast year for which the official government yearbook gives statistics)\r\nwas as follows (_2411-PS_):\r\n\r\n               Union Group          │   Number of   │ Percentage of\r\n                                    │    members    │     total\r\n                                    │               │\r\n      Free Trade Unions             │      4,569,876│           65.9\r\n      Christian Trade Unions        │      1,283,272│           18.5\r\n      Others Unions                 │      1,081,371│           15.6\r\n                                    │           ————│             ——\r\n            Total                   │      6,934,519│          100.0\r\n\r\nUnder the Weimar Constitution, workers were “called upon to take part on\r\nequal terms” with employers in regulating conditions of employment. “It\r\nwas provided that organizations on both sides and agreements between\r\nthem shall be recognized.” Factory Representative Councils (otherwise\r\nknown as Workmens or Factory Works Councils) had the right, in\r\nconjunction with employers’ representatives, to take an official part in\r\nthe initiation and administration of social and economic legislation.\r\n(_2050-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Nazi conspirators conceived that the free trade unions were\r\nincompatible with their objectives._\r\n\r\nHitler stated in _Mein Kampf_:\r\n\r\n    “It (the trade union) created the economic weapon which the\r\n    international world Jew uses for the ruination of the economic\r\n    basis of free, independent states, for the annihilation of their\r\n    national industry and of their national commerce, and thereby\r\n    for the enslavement of free people in the service of the\r\n    above-the-state-standing, world finance Jewry (_ueberstaatlichen\r\n    Weltfinanz-Judentums_).” (_404-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn announcing to Germany the seizure of the Free Trade Unions, Dr.\r\nRobert Ley, speaking as chairman of the Nazi Committee for the\r\nProtection of German Labor, stated:\r\n\r\n    “You may say, what else do you want, you have the absolute\r\n    power, but we do not have the whole people, we do not have you\r\n    workers 100 percent, and it is you whom we want; we will not let\r\n    you be until you stand with us in complete, genuine\r\n    acknowledgement.” (_614-PS_; see also _2224-PS_ and _2283-PS_.)\r\n\r\n(3) _Soon after coming to power the Nazi conspirators took drastic\r\naction to convert the Factory Representative Councils into\r\nNazi-controlled organizations._ The Nazi conspirators eliminated the\r\nindependence of the Factory Representative Councils by giving the\r\nGovernors of the Laender authority to cancel the membership of labor\r\nrepresentatives in the councils; by abrogating the right of the councils\r\nto oppose the dismissal of a worker when he was “suspected of an\r\nunfriendly attitude toward the state” (_1770-PS_); and finally by\r\nlimiting membership in all Factory Representative Councils to Nazis\r\n(_2336-PS_). (After 7 April 1933, the Governors of the Laender were\r\nappointed by the Reich President “upon the proposal of the Reich\r\nChancellor,” Hitler, _2005-PS_).\r\n\r\n(4) _Soon after coming to power the Nazi conspirators proceeded to\r\ndestroy the independent unions._ In mid-April 1933, Hitler directed Dr.\r\nRobert Ley, then staff director of the PO (Political Organization) of\r\nthe NSDAP, to take over the trade unions. (_2283-PS_)\r\n\r\nLey issued an NSDAP circular directive on 21 April 1933 detailing a\r\n“coordination action” (_Gleichschaltunsaktion_) to be taken on 2 May\r\n1933 against the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB) and the\r\nGeneral Independent Employees Federation (AFA), the so-called “Free\r\nTrade Unions” (_392-PS_). This directive created a special “Action\r\nCommittee” to direct the entire action and declared that the supporters\r\nof the action were to be drawn from the National Socialist Factory Cells\r\nOrganization or NSBO (_Nationalsozialistiche\r\nBetriebszellen-Organisation_), the NSDAP political leaders (_Politische\r\nLeiter_) in the factories; it named NSDAP commissars for the\r\nadministration of the larger ADGB unions to be seized in the action; it\r\nmade the Gauleaders (_Gauleiter_) of the NSDAP responsible for the\r\ndisciplined execution of the action in their respective areas and\r\nauthorized them to nominate additional commissars to administer the\r\nunions subjected to the action. The directive ordered that SA and SS\r\nwere to be used in occupying union offices and the Bank of Workers,\r\nEmployees and Officials, Inc., and for taking into protective custody\r\nthe higher union leaders.\r\n\r\nThe order of seizure was carried out as planned and ordered. On 2 May\r\nthe official NSDAP press service reported that the NSBO had “eliminated\r\nthe old leadership” of Free Trade Unions and taken over their\r\nleadership. (_2224-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 3 May 1933 the NSDAP press service announced that the Central League\r\nof Christian Trade Unions (_Gesamtverband der Christlichen\r\nGewerkschaften_) and several smaller unions “have unconditionally\r\nsubordinated themselves to the leadership of Adolf Hitler” (_2225-PS_).\r\nThe next day the NSDAP press stated that the German Nationalist Clerks\r\nLeague (DHV) had also “recognized the leadership of the NSDAP in German\r\ntrade union affairs * * * after a detailed conversation” between Dr. Ley\r\nand the leader of the DHV (_2226-PS_). In late June 1933, as a final\r\nmeasure against the Christian Trade Unions, Ley directed that all their\r\noffices were to be occupied by National Socialists. (_392-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe duress practiced by the Nazi conspirators in their assumption of\r\nabsolute control over the unions is shown by a proclamation of Muchow,\r\nleader of the organizational office of the German Labor Front, in late\r\nJune 1933. By this Party proclamation, all associations of workers not\r\nyet “concentrated” in the German Labor Front had to report within eight\r\ndays. Thereafter they were to be notified of the branch of the German\r\nLabor Front which “they will have to join”. (_2228-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _The Nazi Conspirators eliminated the right of collective bargaining\r\ngenerally._ During the same months in which the unions were abolished, a\r\ndecree eliminated collective bargaining on conditions of employment and\r\nsubstituted regulation by “trustees of labor” (_Treuhaender der Arbeit_)\r\nappointed by Hitler. (_405-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _The Nazi conspirators confiscated all union funds and property._\r\nThe NSDAP circular ordering the seizure of the Free Trade Unions on 2\r\nMay 1933 directed that the SA and SS were to be used to occupy the\r\nbranches and paying offices of the Bank for Workers, Employees and\r\nOfficials and appointed a Nazi commissar, Mueller, for the bank’s\r\nsubsequent direction. The stock of this bank was held entirely by the\r\nGeneral German Trade Union Association and its affiliated member unions.\r\nThe NSDAP circular also directed that all union funds were to be blocked\r\nuntil re-opened under the authority and control of NSDAP-appointed\r\ncommissars (_392-PS_; _2895-PS_). The Fuehrer’s basic order on the\r\nGerman Labor Front of the NSDAP in October 1934 declared that all the\r\nproperty of the trade unions and their dependent organizations\r\nconstituted (_bildet_) property of the German Labor Front (_2271-PS_).\r\nReferring to the seizure of the property of the unions in a speech at\r\nthe 1937 Party Congress, Ley mockingly declared that he would have to be\r\nconvicted if the former trade union leaders were ever to demand the\r\nreturn of their property. (_1678-PS_)\r\n\r\n(7) _The Nazi conspirators persecuted union leaders._ The NSDAP order on\r\nthe seizure of the “Free Trade Unions” directed that the chairmen of the\r\nunions were to be taken into “protective custody”. Lesser leaders could\r\nbe arrested with the permission of the appropriate Gau leader of the\r\nNSDAP (_392-PS_). In late June 1933 the German Labor Front published a\r\n“List of Outlaws” who were to be denied employment in the factories. The\r\nList named union leaders who had been active in combatting National\r\nSocialism and who allegedly continued to carry on their resistance\r\nsecretly. (_2336-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators subjected union leaders to maltreatment ranging\r\nfrom assaults to murder. Among the offenses committed against union\r\nleaders are the following: assault and battery; degrading work and work\r\nbeyond their physical capacity; incarceration in concentration camps;\r\nsolitary confinement; denial of adequate food; surveillance; arrest and\r\nmaltreatment of members of their families; murder. (_2330-PS_;\r\n_2331-PS_; _2335-PS_; _2334-PS_; _2928-PS_; _2277-PS_; _2332-PS_; and\r\n_2333-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Nazi conspirators introduced the Leadership Principle into\r\nindustrial relations._ In January 1934, a decree introduced the\r\nLeadership Principle (_Fuehrerprinzip_) into industrial relations, the\r\nentrepreneur becoming the leader and the workers becoming his followers.\r\n(_1861-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _The Nazi conspirators supplanted independent unions by an affiliated\r\nParty organization, the German Labor Front (DAF)._\r\n\r\n(1) _They created the German Labor Front._ On the day the Nazis seized\r\nthe Free Trade Unions, 2 May 1933, they publicly announced that a\r\n“united front of German workers” with Hitler as honorary patron would be\r\nformed at a Workers’ Congress on 10 May 1933. (_2224-PS_)\r\n\r\nLey was appointed “leader of the German Labor Front” (_Deutsche\r\nArbeitsfront_, or “DAF”) on 10 May 1933 (_1940-PS_). The German Labor\r\nFront succeeded to the confiscated property of the suppressed trade\r\nunion. It was an affiliated organization of the NSDAP, subject to the\r\nLeadership Principle; Ley was concurrently Reich Organization Leader\r\n(_Reichsorganisationsleiter_) and leader of the German Labor Front\r\n(_1814-PS_). The National Socialist Factory Cells Organization or NSBO\r\ncontained the political leaders (_Politische Leiter_) of the NSDAP in\r\nthe German Labor Front and those political leaders were given first\r\npreference in the filling of jobs in the DAF (_2271-PS_). The German\r\nLabor Front became the largest of the Party’s organizations. At the\r\noutbreak of the war it had 23 million individual members and about 10\r\nmillion corporative members who were members of organizations affiliated\r\nwith it. (_2275-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _They utilized the German Labor Front as an instrument to impose\r\ntheir ideology on the masses, to frustrate potential resistance, and to\r\ninsure effective control of the productive labor capacity of Germany._\r\nThe DAF was charged with the ideological orientation of the broad masses\r\nof Germans working in the factories. Its leaders were charged with\r\nweeding out potential opponents to National Socialism from the ranks of\r\nthe DAF and from employment in industry. In its surveillance functions,\r\nthe German Labor Front relied on Gestapo reports and on its own\r\nintelligence service (_2336-PS_). The German Labor Front took over the\r\nleadership of the German Cooperatives with the view to their subsequent\r\nliquidation (_2270-PS_). The Nazi conspirators established Factory\r\nTroops (_Werkscharen_) within the Strength Through Joy branch of the\r\nGerman Labor Front as an “ideological shock squad (_Weltanschaulicher\r\nStosstrupp_) within the factory” (_1817-PS_). These shock squads were\r\nformed only of voluntary members ready “to fight” for Nazi conceptions.\r\nAmong their objects were the speeding up of labor effort and the forging\r\nof a “single-willed community” (_1818-PS_). The SA was charged with the\r\npromotion and building up of Factory Troops by all means. When a factory\r\nworker joined the Factory Troops, he automatically became an SA\r\ncandidate. Factory Troops were given a special uniform and their\r\nphysical training took place within SA cadre units. (_2230-PS_)\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the German Labor Front was made responsible for the care\r\nof foreign labor employed within the Reich (_1913-PS_). Barely two years\r\nafter the suppression of the independent unions and the creation of the\r\nGerman Labor Front, the Nazi conspirators decreed compulsory labor\r\nservice (_Reichsarbeitsdienst_) under which young men and women between\r\n18 and 25 years of age were conscripted for labor service under the\r\nadministration of the Reich Minister of Interior, Frick. (_1389-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter war had been declared, the Nazi conspirators openly admitted the\r\nobjectives of the Nazis’ control over labor. A publication of the\r\nScientific Institute of the German Labor Front declared that it had been\r\ndifficult to make the German people understand continuous renunciations\r\nin social conditions because all the nation’s strength had been\r\nchanneled into armaments (_Wehrhaftigkeit_) for “the anticipated clash\r\nwith an envious surrounding world” (_2276-PS_). Addressing workers five\r\ndays after the launching of war on Poland, Ley admitted that the Nazis\r\nhad mobilized all the resources and energies of Germany for seven years\r\n“so as to be equipped for the supreme effort of battle” and that the\r\nFirst World War had not been lost because of cowardice of German\r\nsoldiers, “but because dissension and discord tore the people asunder”\r\n(_1939-PS_). Ley’s confidence in the Nazis’ effective control over the\r\nproductive labor capacity of Germany in peace or war was declared as\r\nearly as 1936 to the Nurnberg Party Congress:\r\n\r\n    “The idea of the Factory Troops is making good progress in the\r\n    plants, and I am able to report to you, my Fuehrer, that\r\n    security and peace in the factories has been guaranteed, not\r\n    only in normal times, but also in times of the most serious\r\n    crisis. Disturbances such as the munitions strikes of the\r\n    traitors Ebert and confederates, are out of the question.\r\n    _National Socialism has conquered the factories. Factory Troops\r\n    are the National Socialist shock troops within the factory, and\r\n    their motto is: THE FUEHRER IS ALWAYS RIGHT._” (_2283-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO DESTRUCTION OF THE\r\n FREE TRADE UNIONS AND ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OVER THE PRODUCTIVE LABOR\r\n                                CAPACITY\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6, especially 6 (a).│  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (D) 3 │      │\r\n                │  (c) (1).                              │  I   │      19\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

SUPPRESSION OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES\r\n\r\nA. _The Nazi conspirators sought to subvert the influence of the\r\nchurches over the people of Germany._\r\n\r\n(1) _They sought to eliminate the Christian Churches in Germany._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Statements of this aim._ Martin Bormann stated in a secret decree\r\nof the Party Chancellery signed by him and distributed to all Gauleiters\r\n7 June 1941:\r\n\r\n    “Our National Socialist ideology is far loftier than the\r\n    concepts of Christianity, which in their essential points have\r\n    been taken over from Jewry * * *. A differentiation between the\r\n    various Christian confessions is not to be made here * * * the\r\n    Evangelical Church is just as inimical to us as the Catholic\r\n    Church. * * * All influences which might impair or damage the\r\n    leadership of the people exercised by the Fuehrer with the help\r\n    of the NSDAP must be eliminated. More and more the people must\r\n    be separated from the churches and their organs the pastors. * *\r\n    * Just as the deleterious influences of astrologers, seers and\r\n    other fakers are eliminated and suppressed by the State, so must\r\n    the possibility of church influence also be totally removed. * *\r\n    * Not until this has happened, does the state leadership have\r\n    influence on the individual citizens. Not until then are the\r\n    people and Reich secure in their existence for all time.”\r\n    (_D-75_)\r\n\r\nHans Kerrl, Reich Minister for Church Affairs, in a letter dated 6\r\nSeptember 1939 to a Herr Stapel, which indicated that it would be\r\nbrought to the attention of the Confidential Council and of the\r\ndefendant Hess, made the following statements:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer considers his efforts to bring the Evangelical\r\n    Church to reason, unsuccessful and the Evangelical Church with\r\n    respect to its condition rightfully a useless pile of sects. As\r\n    you emphasize the Party has previously carried on not only a\r\n    fight against the political element of the Christianity of the\r\n    Church, but also a fight against membership of Party Members in\r\n    a Christian confession. * * *\r\n\r\n    “The Catholic Church will and must, according to the law under\r\n    which it is set up, remain a thorn in the flesh of a Racial\r\n    State * * *.” (_129-PS_)\r\n\r\nGauleiter Florian, in a letter dated 23 September 1940 to the defendant\r\nHess, stated:\r\n\r\n    “The churches with their Christianity are the danger against\r\n    which to fight is absolutely necessary.” (_064-PS_)\r\n\r\nRegierungsrat Roth, in a lecture 22 September 1941, to a group of\r\nSecurity Police, in the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) concluded his\r\naddress on Security Police (_Sipo_) measures for combatting church\r\npolitics and sects with the following remarks:\r\n\r\n    “The immediate aim: the church must not regain one inch of the\r\n    ground it has lost. The ultimate aim: Destruction of the\r\n    Confessional Churches to be brought about by the collection of\r\n    all material obtained through the intelligence service\r\n    (_Nachrichtendienst_) activities which will at a given time be\r\n    produced as evidence for the charge of treasonable activities\r\n    during the German fight for existence.” (_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Party Organization Book states:\r\n\r\n    “Bravery is valued by the SS man as the highest virtue of men in\r\n    a struggle for his ideology.\r\n\r\n    “He openly and unrelentingly fights the most dangerous enemies\r\n    of the State; Jews, Free Masons, Jesuits, and political\r\n    clergymen.\r\n\r\n    “However, he recruits and convinces the weak and inconstant by\r\n    his example, who have not been able to bring themselves to the\r\n    National Socialistic ideology.” (_1855-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Nazi conspirators promoted beliefs and practices incompatible\r\nwith Christian teachings._ The 24th point of the Program of the NSDAP,\r\nunchanged since its adoption in 1920, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations\r\n    within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence\r\n    or oppose the moral senses of the germanic race. The Party as\r\n    such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without\r\n    binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It\r\n    combats the Jewish materialistic spirit within and around us,\r\n    and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only\r\n    succeed from within on the framework: common utility precedes\r\n    individual utility.” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn official correspondence with the defendant Rosenberg in 1940, Bormann\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “Christian religion and National Socialist doctrines are not\r\n    compatible. * * * The churches cannot be subjugated through\r\n    compromise, only through a new philosophy as prophesied in\r\n    Rosenberg’s works.”\r\n\r\nHe then proposed creation of a National Socialist Catechism to provide a\r\n“moral foundation” for a National Socialist religion which is gradually\r\nto supplant the Christian churches. He stated the matter was so\r\nimportant it should be discussed with members of the Reich Cabinet as\r\nsoon as possible and requested Rosenberg’s opinion before the meeting.\r\n(_098-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a secret decree of the Party Chancellery, signed by Bormann and\r\ndistributed to all _Gauleiters_ on 7 June 1941, the following statements\r\nappeared:\r\n\r\n    “When we National Socialists speak of a belief in God, we do not\r\n    understand by God, like naive Christians and their spiritual\r\n    opportunists, a human-type being, who sits around somewhere in\r\n    the sphere * * *. The force of natural law, with which all these\r\n    innumerable planets move in the universe, we call the Almighty,\r\n    or God. The claim that this world force * * * can be influenced\r\n    by so-called prayers or other astonishing things is based upon a\r\n    proper dose of naiveté or on a business shamelessness.\r\n\r\n    “As opposed to that we National Socialists impose on ourselves\r\n    the demand to live naturally as much as possible, i.e.,\r\n    biologically. The more accurately we recognize and observe the\r\n    laws of nature and of life, the more we adhere to them, so much\r\n    the more do we conform to the will of the Almighty. The more\r\n    insight we have into the will of the Almighty, the greater will\r\n    be our successes.” (_D-75_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg in his book “The Myth of the 20th Century” advocated a new\r\nNational Socialist faith or religion to replace the Christian\r\nconfessions in Germany. He stated that the Catholic and Protestant\r\nchurches represent “negative Christianity” and do not correspond to the\r\nsoul of the “Nordic racially determined peoples”; that a German\r\nreligious movement would have to declare that the idea of neighborly\r\nlove is unconditionally subordinated to national honor; that national\r\nhonor is the highest human value and does not admit of any equal valued\r\nforce such as Christian love. He predicted:\r\n\r\n    “A German religion will, bit by bit, present in the churches\r\n    transferred to it, in place of the crucifixion the spirit of\r\n    fire—the heroic—in the highest sense.” (_2349-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Reich Labor Service (_Reichsarbeitsdienst_), a National Socialist\r\nyouth organization, was prohibited from participating in religious\r\ncelebrations of any kind, and its members were instructed to attend only\r\nthe parts of such ceremonies as weddings and funerals which took place\r\nbefore or after the church celebration. (_107-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators considered religious literature undesirable for\r\nthe Wehrmacht. National Socialist publications were prepared for the\r\nWehrmacht for the expressed purpose of replacing and counteracting the\r\ninfluence of religious literature dissimulated to the troops. (_101-PS_;\r\n_100-PS_; _064-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators through Rosenberg’s Office for Supervision of the\r\nIdeological Training and Education of the NSDAP and the Office of the\r\nDeputy of the Fuehrer “induced” the substitution of National Socialist\r\nmottoes and services for religious prayers and services in the schools\r\nof Germany. (_070-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 14 July 1939, Bormann, as Deputy of the Fuehrer, issued a Party\r\nregulation excluding clergymen, persons closely connected with the\r\nchurch, and Theology students from membership in the Party. It was\r\nfurther decreed that in the future Party Members who entered the clergy\r\nor turned to the study of Theology must leave the Party. (_840-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Nazi conspirators persecuted priests, clergy and members of\r\nmonastic orders._ The priests and clergy of Germany were subjected by\r\nthe police to systematic espionage into their daily lives. The Nazi\r\nconspirators through the Chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA)\r\nmaintained a special branch of the Security Police and Security Service\r\n(Sipo/SD) whose duties were to investigate the churches and maintain\r\nconstant surveillance upon the public and private lives of the clergy.\r\n(_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a conference of these police “church specialists” called by Heydrich,\r\nwho was then SS Gruppenfuehrer and Chief of the Reich Main Security\r\nOffice (RSHA), in Berlin, 23 September 1941, SS Sturmbannfuehrer Hartl,\r\nacting for Heydrich, stated that the greatest importance was to be\r\nattached to church political activity. The intelligence network in this\r\nfield, he continued, was to be fostered with the greatest of care and\r\nenlarged with the recruitment of informants, particular value being\r\nattached to contacts with church circles. He closed his lecture with the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n    “Each of you must go to work with your whole heart and a true\r\n    fanaticism. Should a mistake or two be made in the execution of\r\n    this work, this should in no way discourage you, since mistakes\r\n    are made everywhere. The main thing is that the enemy should be\r\n    constantly tackled with determination, will, and effective\r\n    initiative.” (_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter of 22 October 1941, Heydrich, as Chief of the Reich Main\r\nSecurity Office (RSHA) issued detailed instructions to all State Police\r\nOffices outlining the organization of the Catholic Church and directing\r\nclose surveillance of the activities, writings, and reports of the\r\nCatholic clergy in Germany. In this connection he directed:\r\n\r\n    “Reports are also to be submitted on those Theological students\r\n    destined for Papal Institutes, and Priests returning from such\r\n    institutes to Germany. Should the opportunity arise of placing\r\n    someone for intelligence (_Nachrichtendienst_) purposes in one\r\n    of these Institutes, in the guise of a Theological student, we\r\n    should receive immediate notification.” (_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\nPriests and other members of the clergy were arrested, fined,\r\nimprisoned, and otherwise punished by executive measures of the police\r\nwithout judicial process. In his lecture before a conference at the\r\nReich Main Security Office (RSHA) in Berlin, for “church specialists,”\r\nof the Security Police, 22 November 1941, _Regierungsrat_ Roth stated\r\n(_1815-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “It has been demonstrated that it is impracticable to deal with\r\n    political offenses (malicious) under normal legal procedure.\r\n    Owing to the lack of political perception which still prevails\r\n    among the legal authorities, suspension of this procedure must\r\n    be reckoned with. The so-called “Agitator-Priests” must\r\n    therefore be dealt with in future by Stapo measures, and, if the\r\n    occasion arises, be removed to a Concentration Camp, if agreed\r\n    upon by the RSHA.\r\n\r\n    “The necessary executive measures are to be decided upon\r\n    according to local conditions, the status of the person accused,\r\n    and the seriousness of the case—as follows:\r\n\r\n        1. Warning\r\n\r\n        2. Fine\r\n\r\n        3. Forbidden to preach\r\n\r\n        4. Forbidden to remain in parish\r\n\r\n        5. Forbidden all activity as a priest\r\n\r\n        6. Short-term arrest\r\n\r\n        7. Protective custody.”\r\n\r\nMembers of monastic orders were forced by the seizure and confiscation\r\nof their properties to give up their established place of abode and seek\r\nhomes elsewhere (_R-101-A_; _R-101-D_). A secret order of the SS\r\nEconomic Administration Office to all Concentration Camp Commanders,\r\ndated 21 April 1942, concerning labor mobilization of clergy, reveals\r\nthat clergymen were at that time, and had previously been, incarcerated\r\nin Concentration Camps. (_1164-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the death of von Hindenburg, the Reich Government ordered the ringing\r\nof all church bells on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th August 1934. In Bavaria,\r\nthere were many instances of failure to comply with this order. The\r\nBavarian police submitted a report outlining the above situation and\r\nstating that in three cases the taking into protective custody of\r\nrecalcitrant clergy could not be avoided.\r\n\r\n    “The Parish priest, Father Johann Quinger of Altenkunstadt BA\r\n    Lichtenfels. He was taken into protective custody on 3 August on\r\n    the express order of the State Ministry of the Interior, because\r\n    he assaulted SA leaders and SA men who were ringing the bells\r\n    against his wishes. He was released from custody on 10 August\r\n    1934.\r\n\r\n    “The Parish priest, Father Ludwig Obholzer of Kiefersfelden, BA\r\n    Rosenheim. For his personal safety he was in police custody from\r\n    2400 hours on the 2 August 1934, till 1000 hours on 3 August\r\n    1934. On 5 August 1934, he said sarcastically in his sermon,\r\n    referring to the SA men who had carried out the ringing of the\r\n    funeral knell on their own account, ‘Lord forgive them, for they\r\n    know not what they do’! “The Parish priest, Father Johann\r\n    Nepomuk Kleber of Wiefelsdorf, BA Burglengenfeld, refused to\r\n    ring the church bells on the 2nd and 3rd. He is badly tainted\r\n    politically and had to be taken into protective custody from the\r\n    5th to the 8th of August 34 in the interests of his own safety.”\r\n    (_1521-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter Hitler’s rise to power, Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg delivered a\r\nseries of sermons regarded by the Nazis as damaging, and on 10 April\r\n1938 he refrained from voting in the plebiscite. For this, the Reich\r\nGovernor of Wuertemberg declared he would no longer regard Bishop Sproll\r\nas head of the Diocese of Rottenburg; made an official request that he\r\nleave the Gau; and declared he would see to it that all personal and\r\nofficial intercourse between the Bishop and the State and Party offices\r\nas well as the Armed Forces would be denied (_849-PS_). For his alleged\r\nfailure to vote in the plebiscite, of 10 April 1938, the Party caused\r\nthree demonstrations to be staged against the Bishop and his household\r\nin Rottenburg. The third demonstration was described as follows in a\r\nteletype message from Gestapo Office Stuttgart to Gestapo Office Berlin:\r\n\r\n    “The Party on 23 July 1938 from 2100 on carried out the third\r\n    demonstration against Bishop Sproll. Participants about\r\n    2,500-3,000 were brought in from outside by bus, etc. The\r\n    Rottenburg populace again did not participate in the\r\n    demonstration. The town took rather a hostile attitude to the\r\n    demonstrations. The action got completely out of hand of the\r\n    Party Member responsible for it. The demonstrators stormed the\r\n    palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150 to 200 people\r\n    forced their way into the palace, searched the rooms, threw\r\n    files out of the windows and rummaged through the beds in the\r\n    rooms of the palace. One bed was ignited. Before the fire got to\r\n    the other objects of equipment in the rooms and the palace, the\r\n    flaming bed could be thrown from the window and the fire\r\n    extinguished. The Bishop was with Archbishop Groeber of Freiburg\r\n    and the ladies and gentlemen of his menage in the chapel at\r\n    prayer. About 25 to 30 people pressed into this chapel and\r\n    molested those present. Bishop Groeber was taken for Bishop\r\n    Sproll. He was grabbed by the robe and dragged back and forth.\r\n    Finally the intruders realized that Bishop Groeber is not the\r\n    one they are seeking. They could then be persuaded to leave the\r\n    building. After the evacuation of the palace by the\r\n    demonstrators I had an interview with Archbishop Groeber, who\r\n    left Rottenburg in the night. Groeber wants to turn to the\r\n    Fuehrer and Reich Minister of the Interior Dr. Frick anew. On\r\n    the course of the action, the damage done as well as the homage\r\n    of the Rottenburg populace beginning today for the Bishop I\r\n    shall immediately hand in a full report, after I am in the act\r\n    of suppressing counter mass meetings.” (_848-PS_)\r\n\r\nReich Minister for Church Affairs Kerrl and other Party officials\r\nalleged that these demonstrations were spontaneously staged by indignant\r\ncitizens of Rottenburg and caused representations to be made to the Holy\r\nSee in an effort to effect the Bishop’s removal from office. (_849-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn or about 3 December 1941, a copy of a secret decree of the Party\r\nChancellery on the subject of Relationship of National Socialism to\r\nChristianity was found by the Security Police in the possession of\r\nProtestant Priest Eichholz at Aix-la-Chapelle. For this he was arrested\r\nand held for questioning for an unknown period of time. (_D-75_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Nazi conspirators confiscated church property._ On 20 January\r\n1938, the Gestapo District Office at Munich issued a decree dissolving\r\nthe Guild of the Virgin Mary of the Bavarian Diocese, together with its\r\nbranches and associations. The decree also stated:\r\n\r\n    “The property belonging to the dissolved Guild is to be\r\n    confiscated by the police. Not only is property in cash to be\r\n    confiscated, but also any stock on hand and other objects of\r\n    value. All further activity is forbidden the dissolved Guilds,\r\n    particularly the foundation of any organization intended as a\r\n    successor or as a cover. Incorporation as a body into other\r\n    women’s societies is also to be looked on as a forbidden\r\n    continuation of activity. Infringements against the above\r\n    prohibition will be punished according to par. 4 of the order of\r\n    28.2.1933.”\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the dissolution and confiscation were that the Guild of\r\nthe Virgin Mary had occupied itself for years “to a most far-reaching\r\ndegree” with arrangements of a “worldly and popular sporting character”\r\nsuch as community games and “social evenings”; and further that the\r\npresident of the society supplied the members with “seditious materials”\r\nwhich served for “seditious discussions”; and that the members of the\r\nGuild were trained and mobilized for “political and seditious tasks.”\r\n(_1481-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a lecture delivered to a conference of police investigators of Church\r\nAffairs assembled in the lecture hall of the Reich Main Security Office\r\n(RSHA) in Berlin, 22 September 1941, _Regierungsrat_ Roth stated that\r\nabout 100 monasteries in the Reich had been dissolved and pointed out\r\nthat the proper procedure called for seizure of the churches at the same\r\ntime the monasteries were dissolved. (_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn February 1940, SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich suggested to Himmler the\r\nseizure of monasteries for the accommodation of Racial Germans. He\r\nproposed that the authorities of the monastic orders be instructed to\r\nmake the monasteries concerned available and move their own members to\r\nless populous monasteries. He pointed out that the final expropriation\r\nof properties thus placed at their disposal could be carried out step by\r\nstep in the course of time. Himmler agreed to this proposal and ordered\r\nthe measure to be carried out by the Security Police and Security\r\nService (_Sipo_ and SD) in collaboration with the Reich Commissioner for\r\nConsolidation of German Folkdom. (_R-101-A_)\r\n\r\nThese orders for confiscation were carried out, as revealed in a letter\r\ndated 30 March 1942 from the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) Chief of\r\nStaff to Himmler mentioning claims for compensation pending in a number\r\nof confiscation cases. In this letter he stated that all rental payments\r\nto those monasteries and ecclesiastical institutions whose premises had\r\nbeen put to use as camps for resettlers had been stopped on receipt of\r\nHimmler’s order. Concerning current developments, he stated:\r\n\r\n    “After further preparations in which the Party Chancellery\r\n    participated prominently, the Reich Minister of the Interior\r\n    found a way which makes it possible to seize ecclesiastical\r\n    premises practically without compensation and yet avoids the\r\n    impression of being a measure directed against the Church. * *\r\n    *” (_R-101-D_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter of 19 April 1941, Bormann advised Rosenberg that libraries\r\nand art objects of the monasteries confiscated in the Reich were to\r\nremain for the time being in these monasteries and that the Fuehrer had\r\nrepeatedly rejected the suggestion that centralization of all such\r\nlibraries be undertaken. (_072-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The Nazi conspirators suppressed religious publications._ On 6\r\nNovember 1934, Frick, as Reich and Prussian Minister of the Interior,\r\nissued an order forbidding until further notice publication of all\r\nannouncements in the daily press, in pamphlets and other publications,\r\nwhich dealt with the Evangelical Church; with the exception of official\r\nannouncements of the Church Government of the Reich. (_1498-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy order of the State Police for the District of Duesseldorf, the Police\r\nRegulation which is quoted in part below was promulgated 28 May 1934:\r\n\r\n    “The distribution and sale of published items of any sort in\r\n    connection with worship or religious instructions in public\r\n    streets or squares near churches is forbidden. In the same sense\r\n    the distribution and sale of published items on the occasions of\r\n    processions, pilgrimages and similar church institutions in the\r\n    streets or squares they pass through or in their vicinity is\r\n    prohibited.” (_R-145_)\r\n\r\nIn January 1940, Bormann informed Rosenberg that he had sought to\r\nrestrict production of religious publications by means of having their\r\nrations of printing paper cut down through the control exercised by\r\nReichsleiter Amann, but that the result of these efforts remained\r\nunsatisfactory. (_101-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn March 1940, Bormann instructed Reichsleiter Amann, Director of the\r\nNSDAP Publications Office, that in any future redistribution of paper,\r\nconfessional writings should receive still sharper restrictions in favor\r\nof literature politically and ideologically more valuable. He went on to\r\npoint out:\r\n\r\n    “* * * according to a report I have received, only 10% of the\r\n    over 3000 Protestant periodicals appearing in Germany, such as\r\n    Sunday papers, etc. have ceased publication for reasons of paper\r\n    saving.” (_089-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn April 1940, Bormann informed the High Command of the Navy that use of\r\nthe term “Divine Service” to refer exclusively to the services arranged\r\nby Christian Confessions was no longer to be used, even in National\r\nSocialist daily papers. In the alternative he suggested:\r\n\r\n    “In the opinion of the Party the term ‘Church Service’ cannot be\r\n    objected to. I consider it fitting since it properly implies\r\n    meetings arranged and organized by the _Churches_.” (_068-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_f_) _The Nazi conspirators suppressed religious organizations._ On 28\r\nMay 1934, the State Police Office for the District of Duesseldorf issued\r\nan order concerning denominational youth and professional organizations\r\nwhich stated in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Denominational youth and professional organizations as well as\r\n    those created for special occasions only are prohibited from\r\n    every public activity outside the church and religious sphere.\r\n\r\n    “Especially forbidden is: Any public appearance in groups, all\r\n    sorts of political activity. Any public sport function including\r\n    public hikes and establishment of holiday or outdoor camps. The\r\n    public display or showing of flags, banners, pennants or the\r\n    open wearing of uniforms or insignia.” (_R-145_)\r\n\r\nOn 20 July 1935, Frick, as Reich and Prussian Minister of the Interior,\r\nissued secret instructions to the provincial governments and to the\r\nPrussian Gestapo that Confessional youth organizations were to be\r\nforbidden to wear uniforms, or uniform-like clothing, to assemble\r\npublicly with pennants and flags, to wear insignia as a substitute for\r\nuniforms, or to engage in any outdoor sport activity. (_1482-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 20 January 1938 the Gestapo District Office at Munich, issued a\r\ndecree which stated in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Guild of the Virgin Mary (_die Marianisch\r\n    Jungfrauenkongregation_) of the Bavarian dioceses, including the\r\n    diocese of Speyere, together with its branches and associations\r\n    and the Societies of Our Lady (_Jungfrauenvereinen_) attached to\r\n    it, is by police order to be dissolved and forbidden with\r\n    immediate effect.”\r\n\r\nAmong the reasons cited for this action were the following:\r\n\r\n    “The whole behavior of the Guild of the Virgin Mary had\r\n    therefore to be objected to from various points of view. It\r\n    could be repeatedly observed that the Guild engaged in purely\r\n    worldly affairs, such as community games, and then in the\r\n    holding of ‘Social Evenings’.\r\n\r\n    “This proves incontestably that the Guild of the Virgin Mary was\r\n    active to a very great degree in a manner unecclesiastical and\r\n    therefore worldly. By so doing it has left the sphere of its\r\n    proper religious task and entered a sphere of activity to which\r\n    it has no statutory right. The organization has therefore to be\r\n    dissolved and forbidden.” (_1481-PS_)\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of a Security Police “church specialist”\r\nattached to the State Police Office at Aachen, the following points were\r\nmade by a lecturer at a conference of Security Police and Security\r\nService church intelligence investigators in Berlin, on 22 September\r\n1941:\r\n\r\n    “Retreats, recreational organizations, etc., may now be\r\n    forbidden on ground of industrial war-needs, whereas formerly\r\n    only a worldly activity could be given as a basis.\r\n\r\n    “Youth camps, recreational camps are to be forbidden on\r\n    principle, church organizations in the evening may be prevented\r\n    on grounds of the blackout regulations.\r\n\r\n    “Processions, pilgrimages abroad are to be forbidden by reason\r\n    of the over-burdened transport conditions. For local events too\r\n    technical traffic troubles and the danger of air-attack may\r\n    serve as grounds for their prohibition. (One Referent forbade a\r\n    procession, on the grounds of it wearing out shoe leather).”\r\n    (_1815-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_g_) _The Nazi conspirators suppressed religious education._ In a\r\nspeech on 7 March 1937, Rosenberg stated:\r\n\r\n    “The education of youth can only be carried out by those who\r\n    have rescued Germany from disaster. It is therefore impossible\r\n    to demand one Fuehrer, one Reich and one firmly united people as\r\n    long as education is carried out by forces which are mutually\r\n    exclusive to each other.” (_2351-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech at Fulda, 27 November 1937 Reich Minister for Church Affairs\r\nHans Kerrl stated:\r\n\r\n    “We cannot recognize that the Church has a right to insure that\r\n    the individual should be educated in all respects in the way in\r\n    which it holds to be right; but we must leave it to the National\r\n    Socialist State to educate the child in the way it regards as\r\n    right.” (_2352-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn January 1939, Bormann, acting as Deputy of the Fuehrer, informed the\r\nMinister of Education, that the Party was taking the position that\r\ntheological inquiry was not as valuable as the general fields of\r\nknowledge in the universities and that suppression of Theological\r\nFaculties in the universities was to be undertaken at once. He pointed\r\nout that the Concordat with the Vatican placed certain limitations on\r\nsuch a program, but that in the light of the general change of\r\ncircumstances, particularly the compulsory military service and the\r\nexecution of the four-year plan, the question of manpower made certain\r\nreorganizations, economies and simplification necessary. Therefore,\r\nTheological Faculties were to be restricted insofar as they could not be\r\nwholly suppressed. He instructed that the churches were not to be\r\ninformed of this development and no public announcement was to be made.\r\nAny complaints, if they were to be replied to at all, should be answered\r\nwith a statement that these measures are being executed in a general\r\nplan of reorganization and that similar things are happening to other\r\nfaculties. He concludes with the statement that the professorial chairs\r\nvacated by the above program are to be turned over to the newly-created\r\nfields of inquiry, such as Racial Research. (_116-PS_)\r\n\r\nA plan for the reduction of Theological Faculties was submitted by the\r\nReich Minister for Science, Education and Training in April 1939 to\r\nBormann, who forwarded it to Rosenberg for consideration and action. The\r\nplan called for shifting, combining and eliminating Theological\r\nFaculties in various schools and universities throughout the Reich, with\r\nthe following results:\r\n\r\n    “To recapitulate this plan would include the complete closing of\r\n    Theological Faculties at Innsbruck, Salzburg and Munich, the\r\n    transfer of the faculty of Graz to Vienna and the vanishing of\r\n    four Catholic faculties.\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Closing of three Catholic Theological Faculties or Higher\r\n    Schools and of four Evangelic Faculties in the winter semester\r\n    1939/40.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Closing of one further Catholic and of three further\r\n    Evangelic Faculties in the near future.” (_122-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a secret decree of the Party Chancellery, signed by Bormann, and\r\ndistributed to all Gauleiters on 7 June 1941, the following statement\r\nconcerning religious education was made:\r\n\r\n    “No human being would know anything of Christianity if it had\r\n    not been drilled into him in his childhood by pastors. The\r\n    so-called dear God in no wise gives knowledge of his existence\r\n    to young people in advance, but in an astonishing manner in\r\n    spite of his omnipotence leaves this to the efforts of the\r\n    pastors. If therefore in the future our youth learns nothing\r\n    more of this Christianity, whose doctrines are far below ours,\r\n    Christianity will disappear by itself.” (_D-75_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Supplementary evidence of acts of suppression within Germany._ In\r\nlaying the groundwork for their attempted subversion of the Church, the\r\nNazi conspirators resorted to assurances of peaceful intentions. Thus\r\nHitler, in his address to the Reichstag on 23 March 1933 declared:\r\n\r\n    “While the government is determined to carry through the\r\n    political and moral purging of our public life, it is creating\r\n    and insuring prerequisites for a truly religious life. The\r\n    government sees in both Christian confessions the factors most\r\n    important for the maintenance of our Folkdom. It will respect\r\n    agreements concluded between them and the states. However, it\r\n    expects that its work will meet with a similar appreciation. The\r\n    government will treat all other denominations with equal\r\n    objective justice. However, it can never condone that belonging\r\n    to a certain denomination or to a certain race might be regarded\r\n    as a license to commit or tolerate crimes. The Government will\r\n    devote its care to the sincere living together of Church and\r\n    State.” (_3387-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Against the Evangelical Churches._ The Nazi conspirators, upon\r\ntheir accession to power, passed a number of laws, under\r\ninnocent-sounding titles, designed to reduce the Evangelical Churches to\r\nthe status of an obedient instrument of Nazi policy.

Youth Association into the Hitler Jugend under Von\r\nSchirach in December 1933. (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nThey arrested prominent Protestant leaders such as Pastor Niemoeller. By\r\n1937, the result of all these measures was complete administrative\r\ncontrol by the Nazi conspirators over the Evangelical churches.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Against the Catholic Church._ Just as in their program against\r\nthe Evangelical Churches, so in their attack on the Catholic Church, the\r\nNazi conspirators concealed their real intentions under a cloak of\r\napparent respect for its rights and protection of its activities. On 20\r\nJuly 1933, a Concordat was concluded between the Holy See and the German\r\nReich, signed for the Reich by Von Papen (_3280-A-PS_). It was the Nazi\r\nGovernment, not the Church, which initiated the negotiations.\r\n\r\n    “The German Government asked the Holy See to conclude a\r\n    Concordat with the Reich.” (_3268-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy Article I of the Concordat,\r\n\r\n    “The German Reich guarantees freedom of profession and public\r\n    practice of the Catholic religion.\r\n\r\n    “It acknowledges the right of the Catholic Church, within the\r\n    limit of those laws which are applicable to all, to manage and\r\n    regulate her own affairs independently, and, within the\r\n    framework of her own competence, to publish laws and ordinances\r\n    binding on her members.” (_3280-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther articles formulated agreements on basic principles such as free\r\ncommunication between Rome and the local ecclesiastical authorities,\r\nfreedom of the Catholic press, of Catholic education and of Catholic\r\naction in charitable, professional, and youth organizations. In return,\r\nthe Vatican pledged loyalty by the clergy to the Reich Government and\r\nemphasis in religious instruction on the patriotic duties of the\r\nChristian citizen. (_3280-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn reliance upon assurances by the Nazi conspirators, the Catholic\r\nhierarchy had already revoked their previous prohibition against\r\nCatholics becoming members of the Nazi Party (_3389-PS_). The Catholic\r\nCenter Party, under a combination of Nazi pressure and assurances,\r\npublished on 29 December 1933, an announcement of its dissolution\r\n(_2403-PS_). Thus the Catholics went a long way to disarm themselves and\r\ncooperate with the Nazis. Nevertheless, the Nazi conspirators continued\r\nto develop their policy of slow strangulation of religion, first in\r\ncovert, and then in open, violation of their assurances and agreements.\r\n\r\nIn the Encyclical “_Mit Brennender Sorge_”, on 14 March 1937, Pope Pius\r\nXI described the program:\r\n\r\n    “It discloses intrigues which from the beginning had no other\r\n    aim than a war of extermination. In the furrows in which we had\r\n    labored to sow the seeds of true peace, others—like the enemy\r\n    in Holy Scripture (Matt. xiii, 25)—sowed the tares of\r\n    suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny of secret and open\r\n    fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church, fed from a\r\n    thousand different sources and making use of every available\r\n    means. On them and on them alone and on their silent and vocal\r\n    protectors rests the responsibility that now on the horizon of\r\n    Germany there is to be seen not the rainbow of peace but the\r\n    threatening storm clouds of destructive religious wars. * * *\r\n    Anyone who has any sense of truth left in his mind and even a\r\n    shadow of the feeling of justice left in his heart will have to\r\n    admit that, in the difficult and eventful years which followed\r\n    the Concordat, every word and every action of Ours was ruled by\r\n    loyalty to the terms of the agreement; but also he will have to\r\n    recognize with surprise and deep disgust that the unwritten law\r\n    of the other party has been arbitrary misinterpretation of\r\n    agreements, evasion of agreements, evacuation of the meaning of\r\n    agreements, and finally more or less open violation of\r\n    agreements.” (_3280-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazis suppressed the Catholic Youth League, beginning ten days after\r\nthe concordat was signed. (See Section 8, infra.)\r\n\r\nOn 18 January 1942, in declining to accede to a demand made by the\r\nGerman Government that no further appointment of Archbishops, Bishops,\r\nand other high administrative dignitaries be made in the new territories\r\nof the Reich, or of certain of them within the old Reich, without\r\nprevious consultation with the German Government (_3261-PS_), the\r\nSecretary of State of Pope Pius XII pointed to measures taken by the\r\nGerman Government,\r\n\r\n    “Contrary not only to the existing Concordats and to the\r\n    principles of international law ratified by the Second Hague\r\n    conference, but often—and this is much more grave—to the very\r\n    fundamental principles of divine law, both natural and\r\n    positive.”\r\n\r\nThe Papal Secretary of State continued:\r\n\r\n    “Let it suffice to recall in this connection, among other\r\n    things, the changing of the Catholic State elementary schools\r\n    into undenominational schools; the permanent or temporary\r\n    closing of many minor seminaries, of not a few major seminaries\r\n    and of some theological faculties; the suppression of almost all\r\n    the private schools and of numerous Catholic boarding schools\r\n    and colleges; the repudiation, decided unilaterally, of\r\n    financial obligations which the State, Municipalities, etc. had\r\n    towards the Church; the increasing difficulties put in the way\r\n    of the activity of the religious Orders and Congregations in the\r\n    spiritual, cultural and social field and above all the\r\n    suppression of Abbeys, monasteries, convents and religious\r\n    houses in such great numbers that one is led to infer a\r\n    deliberate intention of rendering impossible the very existence\r\n    of the Orders and Congregations in Germany.\r\n\r\n    “Similar and even graver acts must be deplored in the annexed\r\n    and occupied territories, especially in the Polish territories\r\n    and particularly in the _Reichsgau Wartheland_, for which the\r\n    Reich Superintendent has issued, under date of September 13th\r\n    last, a ‘Decree concerning Religious Associations and Religious\r\n    Societies’ (_Verordnung ueber Religioese Vereinigungen und\r\n    Religion-gesellschaften_) in clear opposition to the fundamental\r\n    principles of the divine constitution of the Church.”\r\n    (_3261-PS_)\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the numerous other cases and specific incidents which\r\nmight be adduced as the program of suppression was carried into action\r\nwithin Germany proper, are the measures adopted beginning in 1936 to\r\neliminate the priest Rupert Mayer of Munich. Because of his sermons, he\r\nwas confined in various prisons, arrested and rearrested, interned in\r\nOranienburg-Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and the Ettal Monastery,\r\nfrom which he was released by Allied troops in May 1945, and later died.\r\n(_3272-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Against other religious groups._\r\n\r\nMembers of the sect known as “_Bibelforscher_”—meaning “Members of a\r\nBiblical Society” or “Bible-Researchers”—were as early as 1937 sent as\r\na routine matter to concentration camps by the Gestapo, even after\r\nserving of a sentence imposed by a court or after the cancellation of an\r\narrest order (_D-84_). At one camp alone—Dachau—there were over 150\r\n“_Bibelforscher_” in protective custody in 1937. (_2928-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Acts of suppression of the Christian Churches in Annexed and\r\nOccupied Territories._\r\n\r\n(1) _In Austria._ The methods of suppression of churches followed in\r\nAustria by the occupying power began with measures to exclude the Church\r\nfrom public activities, such as processions, printing of newspapers and\r\nReviews which could spread Christian doctrines; from forming Youth\r\norganizations, such as Boy Scouts; from directing educational or\r\ncharitable activities; and even from extending help in the form of food\r\nto foreigners. Unable in conscience to obey the public prescription,\r\nministers of religions were arrested and sent to concentration camps,\r\nand some were executed. Churches were closed, convents and monastries\r\nsuppressed, and educational property confiscated. The total number of\r\nconfiscations, suppressions, or alienations of religious institutions\r\nexceeded 100 cases in one diocese alone. (_3278-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran Church in Austria, though comprising a small minority of\r\nthe population, was subjected to organized oppression. Its educational\r\nefforts were obstructed or banned. Believers were encouraged, and\r\nsometimes intimidated, to repudiate their faith. Lutheran pastors were\r\ngiven to understand that a government position would be awarded to each\r\none who would renounce his ministry and if possible withdraw from the\r\nLutheran Church. (_3273-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn summation of the period of Nazi domination and in review of the\r\nattempted suppression of the Christian Church, the Archbishops and\r\nBishops of Austria in their first joint Pastoral after liberation\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n    “At an end also is an intellectual battle, the goal of which was\r\n    the destruction of Christianity and the Church among our people;\r\n    a campaign of lies and treachery against truth and love, against\r\n    divine and human rights and against international law.”\r\n    (_3274-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _In Czechoslovakia._ The Czechoslovak Official Report for the\r\nprosecution and trial of the German Major War Criminals by the\r\nInternational Military Tribunal established according to the Agreement\r\nof the Four Great Powers of 8 August, 1945 describes in summary form the\r\nmeasures taken by the Nazi conspirators to suppress religious liberties\r\nand persecute the churches. The following excerpts are quoted from this\r\nreport (_998-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) _Catholic Church._\r\n\r\n    “* * * At the outbreak of war, 487 Catholic priests were among\r\n    the thousands of Czech patriots arrested and sent to\r\n    concentration camps as hostages. Venerable high ecclesiastical\r\n    dignitaries were dragged to concentration camps in Germany. * *\r\n    * Religious orders were dissolved and liquidated, their\r\n    charitable institutions closed down and their members expelled\r\n    or else forced to compulsory labor in Germany. All religious\r\n    instruction in Czech schools was suppressed. Most of the\r\n    weeklies and monthlies which the Catholics had published in\r\n    Czechoslovakia, had been suppressed from the very beginning of\r\n    the occupation. The Catholic gymnastic organization “Orel” with\r\n    800,000 members was dissolved and its property was confiscated.\r\n    To a great extent Catholic church property was seized for the\r\n    benefit of the Reich.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) _Czechoslovak National Church._\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Czechoslovak Church in Slovakia was entirely\r\n    prohibited and its property confiscated under German compulsion\r\n    in 1940. It has been allowed to exist in Bohemia and Moravia but\r\n    in a crippled form under the name of the Czecho-Moravian Church.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) _Protestant Churches._\r\n\r\n    “The Protestant Churches were deprived of the freedom to preach\r\n    the gospel. German secret state police watched closely whether\r\n    the clergy observed the restrictions imposed on it. * * * Some\r\n    passages from the Bible were not allowed to be read in public at\r\n    all. * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * Church leaders were especially persecuted, scores of\r\n    ministers were imprisoned in concentration camps, among them the\r\n    General Secretary of the Students’ Christian Movement in\r\n    Czechoslovakia. One of the Vice-Presidents was executed.\r\n\r\n    “Protestant Institutions such as the YMCA and YWCA were\r\n    suppressed throughout the country.\r\n\r\n    “The leading Theological School for all Evangelical\r\n    denominations, HUS Faculty in Prague and all other Protestant\r\n    training schools for the ministry were closed down in November\r\n    1939, with the other Czech universities and colleges.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) _Czech Orthodox Church._\r\n\r\n    “The hardest blow was directed against the Czech Orthodox\r\n    Church. The Orthodox churches in Czechoslovakia were ordered by\r\n    the Berlin Ministry of Church Affairs to leave the Pontificat of\r\n    Belgrade and Constantinople respectively and to become\r\n    subordinate to the Berlin Bishop. The Czech Bishop Gorazd was\r\n    executed together with two other priests of the Orthodox Church.\r\n    By a special order of the Protector Daluege, issued in September\r\n    1942, the Orthodox Church of Serbian Constantinople jurisdiction\r\n    was completely dissolved in the Czech lands, its religious\r\n    activity forbidden and its property confiscated.\r\n\r\n    “All Evangelical education was handed over to the civil\r\n    authorities and many Evangelical teachers lost their employment;\r\n    moreover the State grant to salaries of many Evangelical priests\r\n    was taken away.” (_998-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _In Poland._ The repressive measures levelled against the Christian\r\nChurch in Poland where Hans Frank was Governor-General from 1939 to\r\n1945, were even more drastic and sweeping. In protest against the\r\nsystematic strangulation of religion, the Vatican, on 8 October 1942,\r\naddressed a memorandum to the German Embassy accredited to the Holy See\r\nin which the Secretariat of State emphasized the fact that despite\r\nprevious protests to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Reich, von\r\nRibbentrop, the religious condition of the Catholics in the _Warthegau_\r\n“has become even sadder and more tragic.” This memorandum states:\r\n\r\n    “For quite a long time the religious situation in the\r\n    _Warthegau_ gives cause for very grave and ever-increasing\r\n    anxiety. There, in fact, the Episcopate has been little by\r\n    little almost completely eliminated; the secular and regular\r\n    clergy have been reduced to proportions that are absolutely\r\n    inadequate, because they have been in large part deported and\r\n    exiled; the education of clerics has been forbidden; the\r\n    Catholic education of youth is meeting with the greatest\r\n    opposition; the nuns have been dispersed; insurmountable\r\n    obstacles have been put in the way of affording people the helps\r\n    of religions; very many churches have been closed; Catholic\r\n    intellectual and charitable institutions have been destroyed;\r\n    ecclesiastical property has been seized.” (_3263-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 18 November 1942 the Papal Secretary of State requested the\r\nArchbishop of Breslau, Cardinal Bertram, to use every effort to assist\r\nPolish Catholic workers transferred to Germany, who were being deprived\r\nof the consolations of religion. In addition, he again appealed for help\r\nfor the Polish priests detained in various concentration camps, whose\r\ndeath rate was “still on the increase.” (_3265-PS_). On 7 December 1942\r\nthe Cardinal Archbishop of Breslau replied that all possible efforts\r\nwere being put forward by the German Bishops without success on behalf\r\nof the victims of concentration camps and labor battalions, and deplored\r\n“the intolerable decrees” against religious ministration to Poles.\r\n(_3266-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 2 March 1943, the Cardinal Secretary of State addressed a note to von\r\nRibbentrop, Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs, in which the violations\r\nof religious rights and conscience among the civilian population of\r\nPoland were set out in detail, and the time, locality, and character of\r\nthe persecutions were specified. Priests and Ecclesiastics were still\r\nbeing arrested, thrust into concentration camps, and treated with scorn\r\nand derision, while many had been summarily executed. Religious\r\ninstruction was hampered; Catholic schools were closed; the use of the\r\nPolish language in sacred functions and even in the Sacrament of Penance\r\nwas forbidden. Even the natural right of marriage was denied to men of\r\nPolish nationality under 28 years of age to women under 25. In the\r\nterritory called “General Government” similar conditions existed and\r\nagainst these the Holy See vigorously protested. To save the harassed\r\nand persecuted leaders of the Catholic Church, the Vatican had\r\npetitioned that they be allowed to emigrate to neutral countries of\r\nEurope or America. The only concession made was that they would all be\r\ncollected in one concentration camp—Dachau. (_3264-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators adopted a dilatory and obstructionist policy\r\ntoward complaints as to religious affairs in the overrun territories,\r\nand a decision was “taken by those competent to do so. * * * that no\r\nfurther consideration will be taken of proposals or requests concerning\r\nthe territories which do not belong to the Old Reich.” (_3262-PS_)\r\n\r\n“Those competent” to make decisions on complaints as to religious\r\naffairs in the overrun territories—especially the Party Chancery,\r\nheaded by Bormann—the methods they used, and the reasons for their\r\nattitude are outlined by the Cardinal Archbishop of Breslau, a German\r\nliving in Germany, in a letter to the Papal Secretary of State on 7\r\nDecember 1942 as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Your Eminence knows very well the greatest difficulty in the\r\n    way of opening negotiations comes from the overruling authority\r\n    which the “National Socialist Party Chancery” (_Kanzlei der\r\n    National-Sozialistischen Partei_, known as the _Partei-Kanzlei_)\r\n    exercises in relation to the Chancery of the Reich\r\n    (_Reichskanzlei_) and to the single Reich Ministries. This\r\n    ‘_Parteikanzlei_’ directs the course to be followed by the\r\n    State, whereas the Ministries and the Chancery of the Reich are\r\n    obliged and compelled to adjust their decrees to these\r\n    directions. Besides, there is the fact that the “Supreme Office\r\n    for the Security of the Reich” called the\r\n    ‘_Reichssicherheitshauptamt_’ enjoys an authority which\r\n    precludes all legal action and all appeals. Under it are the\r\n    ‘Secret Offices for Public Security’ called ‘_Geheime\r\n    Staatspolizei_’ (a title shortened usually to _Gestapo_) of\r\n    which there is one for each Province. Against the decrees of\r\n    this Central Office (_Reichssicherheitshauptamt_) and of the\r\n    Secret Offices (_Geheime Staatspolizei_) there is no appeal\r\n    through the Courts, and no complaint made to the Ministries has\r\n    any effect. Not infrequently the Councillors of the Ministries\r\n    suggest that they have not been able to do as they would wish\r\n    to, because of the opposition of these Party offices. As far as\r\n    the executive power is concerned, the organization called the\r\n    SS, that is _Schutzstaffeln der Partei_, is in practice supreme.\r\n\r\n    “This hastily sketched interrelation of authorities is the\r\n    reason why many of the petitions and protests made by the\r\n    Bishops to the Ministries have been foiled. Even if we present\r\n    our complaints to the so-called Supreme Security Office, there\r\n    is rarely any reply; and when there is, it is negative.\r\n\r\n    “On a number of very grave and fundamental issues we have also\r\n    presented our complaints to the Supreme Leader of the Reich\r\n    (_Fuehrer_). Either no answer is given, or it is apparently\r\n    edited by the above-mentioned Party Chancery, which does not\r\n    consider itself bound by the Concordat made with the Holy See.”\r\n    (_3266-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe interchange of correspondence following the transmission of the\r\nabove-described note of 2 March 1943 on the religious situation in the\r\noverrun Polish Provinces illustrates the same evasive tactics.\r\n(_3269-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his Allocution to the Sacred College, on 2 June 1945, His Holiness\r\nPope Pius XII recalled, by way of example, “some details from the\r\nabundant accounts which have reached us from priests and laymen who were\r\ninterned in the concentration camp at Dachau”:\r\n\r\n    “In the forefront, for the number and harshness of the treatment\r\n    meted out to them, are the Polish priests. From 1940 to 1945,\r\n    2,800 Polish ecclesiastics and religious were imprisoned in that\r\n    camp; among them was the Auxiliary bishop of Wloclawek, who died\r\n    there of typhus. In April last there were left only 816, all the\r\n    others being dead except for two or three transferred to another\r\n    camp. In the summer of 1942, 480 German-speaking ministers of\r\n    religion were known to be gathered there; of these, 45 were\r\n    Protestants, all the others Catholic priests. In spite of the\r\n    continuous inflow of new internees, especially from some\r\n    dioceses of Bavaria, Rhenania and Westphalia, their number, as a\r\n    result of the high rate of mortality, at the beginning of this\r\n    year, did not surpass 350. Nor should we pass over in silence\r\n    those belonging to occupied territories, Holland, Belgium,\r\n    France (among whom the Bishop of Clermont), Luxembourg,\r\n    Slovenia, Italy. Many Of those priests and laymen endured\r\n    indescribable sufferings for their faith and for their vocation.\r\n    In one case the hatred of the impious against Christ reached the\r\n    point of parodying on the person of an interned priest, with\r\n    barbed wire, the scourging and the crowning with thorns of our\r\n    Redeemer.” (_3268-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther revealing figures on the persecution of Polish priests are\r\ncontained in the following extract from Charge No. 17 against Hans\r\nFrank, Governor-General of Poland, submitted by the Polish Government,\r\nentitled “Maltreatment and Persecution of the Catholic Clergy in the\r\nWestern Provinces”:\r\n\r\n    “IV. _GENERAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF THE PERSECUTION_\r\n\r\n        11. The general situation of the clergy in the\r\n        Archdiocese of Poznan in the beginning of April 1940 is\r\n        summarized in the following words of Cardinal Hlond’s\r\n        second report:\r\n\r\n            ‘5 priests shot\r\n\r\n            27 priests confined in harsh concentration camps\r\n            at Stutthof and in other camps\r\n\r\n            190 priests in prison or in concentration camps\r\n            at Bruczkow, Chludowo, Goruszki, Kazimierz,\r\n            Biskupi, Lad, Lubin and Puszczykowo,\r\n\r\n            35 priests expelled into the Government General,\r\n\r\n            11 priests seriously ill in consequence of\r\n            ill-treatment,\r\n\r\n            122 parishes entirely left without priests.’\r\n\r\n        12. In the diocese of Chelmno, where about 650 priests\r\n        were installed before the war only 3% were allowed to\r\n        stay, the 97% of them were imprisoned, executed or put\r\n        into concentration camps.\r\n\r\n        13. By January 1941 about 7000 priests were killed, 3000\r\n        were in prison or concentration camps.” (_3279-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Allocution of Pope Pius XII on 2 June 1945 described National\r\nSocialism as “the arrogant apostasy from Jesus Christ, the denial of His\r\ndoctrine and of His work of redemption, the cult of violence, the\r\nidolatry of race and blood, the overthrow of human liberty and dignity.”\r\nIt summarized the attacks of “National Socialism” on the Catholic Church\r\nin these terms:\r\n\r\n    “The struggle against the Church did, in fact, become even more\r\n    bitter: there was the dissolution of Catholic organizations; the\r\n    gradual suppression of the flourishing Catholic schools, both\r\n    public and private; the enforced weaning of youth from family\r\n    and Church; the pressure brought to bear on the conscience of\r\n    citizens, and especially of civil servants; the systematic\r\n    defamation, by means of a clever, closely-organized propaganda,\r\n    of the Church, the clergy, the faithful, the Church’s\r\n    institutions, teaching and history; the closing, dissolution,\r\n    confiscation of religious houses and other ecclesiastical\r\n    institutions; the complete suppression of the Catholic press and\r\n    publishing houses.” (_3268-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO SUPPRESSION OF THE\r\n                           CHRISTIAN CHURCHES\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6, especially 6 (a, │      │\r\n                │  c).                                   │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (D) 3│      │\r\n                │  (_c_) (2, 3); X (B).                  │  I   │  20, 55\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

ADOPTION AND PUBLICATION OF THE PROGRAM FOR\r\n                           PERSECUTION OF JEWS\r\n\r\nA. _The official program of the NSDAP, proclaimed 24 February 1920 by\r\nAdolf Hitler at a public gathering in Munich._\r\n\r\n    Point 4: “None but members of the nation (_Volksgenosse_) may be\r\n    citizens. None but those of German blood, whatever their creed,\r\n    may be members of the nation. No Jew, therefore, may be a member\r\n    of the nation.”\r\n\r\n    Point 5: “Anyone who is not a citizen may live in Germany only\r\n    as a guest and must be regarded as being subject to legislation\r\n    for foreigners.”\r\n\r\n    Point 6: “The right to determine matters concerning government\r\n    and legislation is to be enjoyed by the citizen alone. We demand\r\n    therefore that all appointments to public office, of whatever\r\n    kind, whether in the Reich, Land, or municipality, be filled\r\n    only by citizens. * * *”\r\n\r\n    Point 7: “We demand that the state make it its first duty to\r\n    promote the industry and livelihood of citizens. If it is not\r\n    possible to nourish the entire population of the State, the\r\n    members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled\r\n    from the Reich.”\r\n\r\n    Point 8: “Any further immigration of non-Germans is to be\r\n    prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who entered Germany\r\n    subsequent to 2 August 1914, shall be forced immediately to\r\n    leave the Reich.”\r\n\r\n    Point 23: “We demand legal warfare against conscious political\r\n    lies and their dissemination through the press. In order to make\r\n    possible the creation of a German press we demand:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) that all editors and collaborators of newspapers published\r\n    in the German language be members of the nation.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) non-German newspapers be requested to have express\r\n    permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed\r\n    in the German language.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) non-Germans be prohibited by law from financial\r\n    participation in or influence on German newspapers, and that as\r\n    penalty for contravention of the law such newspapers be\r\n    suppressed and all non-Germans participating in it expelled from\r\n    the Reich. * * *” (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Development of ideological basis for anti-Semitic measures._\r\n\r\nAmong the innumerable statements made by the leaders of the NSDAP are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nRosenberg advocated in 1920 the adoption of the following program\r\nconcerning the Jews:\r\n\r\n    “(1) The Jews are to be recognized as a (separate) nation living\r\n    in Germany, irrespective of the religion they belong to.\r\n\r\n    (2) A Jew is he whose parents on either side are nationally\r\n    Jews. Anyone who has a Jewish husband or wife is henceforth a\r\n    Jew.\r\n\r\n    (3) Jews have no right to speak and write on or be active in\r\n    German politics.\r\n\r\n    (4) Jews have no right to hold public offices, or to serve in\r\n    the Army either as soldiers or as officers. However, their\r\n    contribution of work may be considered.\r\n\r\n    (5) Jews have no right to be leaders of cultural institutions of\r\n    the state and community (theaters, galleries, etc.) or to be\r\n    professors and teachers in German schools and universities.\r\n\r\n    (6) Jews have no right to be active in state or municipal\r\n    commissions for examinations, control, censorship, etc. Jews\r\n    have no right to represent the German Reich in economic\r\n    treaties; they have no right to be represented in the\r\n    directorate of state banks or communal credit establishments.\r\n\r\n    (7) Foreign Jews have no right to settle in Germany permanently.\r\n    Their admission into the German political community is to be\r\n    forbidden under all circumstances.\r\n\r\n    (8) Zionism should be energetically supported in order to\r\n    promote the departure of German Jews—in numbers to be\r\n    determined annually—to Palestine or generally across the\r\n    border.” (_2842-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s “Zionism” was neither sincere nor consistent, for in 1921 he\r\nadvocated breaking up Zionism, “which is involved in English-Jewish\r\npolitics.” (_2432-PS_). He advocated in 1921 the adoption by “all\r\nGermans” of the following slogans: “Get the Jews out of all parties.\r\nInstitute measures for the repudiation of all citizenship rights of all\r\nJews and half-Jews: banish all the Eastern Jews; exercise strictest\r\nvigilance over the native ones. * * *” (_2432-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrick and other Nazis introduced a motion in the Reichstag on 27 May\r\n1924, “to place all members of the Jewish race under special laws.”\r\n(_2840-PS_). Frick also asked in the Reichstag, on 25 August 1924, for\r\nthe realization of the Nazi program by “exclusion of all Jews from\r\npublic office.” (_2893-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _Anti-Semitism was seized upon by the Nazi conspirators as a\r\nconvenient instrument to unite groups and classes of divergent views and\r\ninterests under one banner._\r\n\r\nAdolf Hitler described racial anti-Semitism as “a new creed for the\r\nmasses” and its spreading among the German people as “the most\r\nformidable task to be accomplished by our movement.” (_2881-PS_).\r\nRosenberg called for the “_Zusammenraffen aller Deutschen zu einer\r\nstahlharten, voelkischen Einheitsfront_” (gathering of all Germans into\r\na steel-hard racial united front) on the basis of anti-Semitic slogans\r\n(_2432-PS_). Gotfried Feder, official commentator of the Nazi Party\r\nprogram, stated: “Anti-Semitism is in a way the emotional foundation of\r\nour movement.” (_2844-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable admissions on the part of the Nazi leaders as to\r\nthe part which their anti-Semitic propaganda played in their acquisition\r\nof control. The following statement concerning the purpose of racial\r\npropaganda was made by Dr. Walter Gross, director of the Office of\r\nRacial Policy of the Nazi Party:\r\n\r\n    “In the years of fight, the aim was to employ all means of\r\n    propaganda which promised success in order to gather people who\r\n    were ready to overthrow, together with the Party, the harmful\r\n    post-war regime and put the power into the hand of the Fuehrer\r\n    and his collaborators. * * * In these years of fight the aim was\r\n    purely political: I meant the overthrow of the regime and\r\n    acquisition of power. * * * Within this great general task the\r\n    education in racial thinking necessarily played a decisive part,\r\n    because herein lies basically the deepest revolutionary nature\r\n    of the new spirit.” (_2845-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn another official Nazi publication, recommended for circulation in all\r\nParty units and establishments, it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “The whole treatment of the Jewish problem in the years prior to\r\n    our seizure of power is to be regarded essentially from the\r\n    point of view of the political education of the German people.”\r\n    (To disregard this angle of the use made of anti-Semitism means)\r\n    “to disregard the success and aim of the work toward racial\r\n    education.” (_2427-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _After the acquisition of power the Nazi conspirators initiated a\r\nstate policy of persecution of the Jews._\r\n\r\n(1) _The first organized act was the boycott of Jewish enterprises on 1\r\nApril 1933._ The boycott action was approved by all the defendants who\r\nwere members of the _Reichsregierung_ (Reich Cabinet), and Streicher was\r\ncharged with its execution. Presented as an alleged act of “self\r\ndefense”, the boycott action was intended to frighten Jewish public\r\nopinion abroad and force it, by the threat of collective responsibility\r\nto all Jews in Germany, to desist from warning against the Nazi danger.\r\n(_2409-PS_; _2410-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe boycott was devised as a demonstration of the extent to which the\r\nNazi Party controlled its members and the German masses; consequently,\r\nspontaneous action and physical violence were discouraged. Goebbels\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “The national socialist leadership had declared: ‘The boycott is\r\n    legal’, and the government demands that the people permit that\r\n    the boycott be carried out legally. We expect iron discipline.\r\n    This must be for the whole world a wonderful show of unity and\r\n    manly training. To those abroad who believe that we could not\r\n    manage it, we want to show that we have the people in our hand.”\r\n    (_2431-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Laws eliminating Jews from various offices and functions._ The Nazi\r\nconspirators legislative program was gradual and, in the beginning,\r\nrelatively “moderate.” In the first period, which dates from 7 April\r\n1933 until September 1935, the laws eliminated Jews from public office\r\nand limited their participation in schools, certain professions, and\r\ncultural establishments.

This legislative activity, in addition to being the first\r\nstep towards the elimination of the Jews, served an “educational”\r\npurpose and was a further test of the extent of control exerted by the\r\nNazi Party and regime over the German masses.\r\n\r\nDr. Achim Gercke, racial expert of the Ministry of the Interior, stated:\r\n\r\n    “The laws are mainly educational and give direction. The aspect\r\n    of the laws should not be underestimated. The entire nation is\r\n    enlightened on the Jewish problem; it learns to understand that\r\n    the national community is a blood community; it understands for\r\n    the first time the racial idea, and is diverted from a too\r\n    theoretical treatment of the Jewish problem and faced with the\r\n    actual solution.” (_2904-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was clear, however, that the Nazi conspirators had a far more\r\nambitious program in the Jewish problem and put off its realization for\r\nreasons of expediency. In the words of Dr. Gercke:\r\n\r\n    “Nevertheless the laws published thus far cannot bring a final\r\n    solution of the Jewish problem, because the time has not yet\r\n    come for it, although the decrees give the general direction and\r\n    leave open the possibility of further developments.\r\n\r\n    “It would be in every respect premature now to work out and\r\n    publicly discuss plans to achieve more than can be achieved for\r\n    the time being. However, one must point out a few basic\r\n    principles so that the ideas which one desires and must have\r\n    ripened will contain no mistakes. * * *\r\n\r\n    “All suggestions aiming at a permanent situation, at a\r\n    stabilization of, the status of the Jews in Germany do not solve\r\n    the Jewish problem, because they do not detach the Jews from\r\n    Germany. * * *\r\n\r\n    “_Plans and programs must contain an aim pointing to the future\r\n    and not merely consisting of the regulation of a momentarily\r\n    uncomfortable situation._” (_2904-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Deprivation of Jews of their rights as citizens._ After a\r\npropaganda barrage, in which the speeches and writings of Streicher were\r\nmost prominent, the Nazi conspirators initiated the second period of\r\nanti-Jewish legislation (15 September 1935 to September 1938). In this\r\nperiod the Jews were deprived of their full rights as citizens (First\r\nNurnberg Law) and forbidden to marry “Aryans” (Second Nurnberg Law).\r\nFurther steps were taken to eliminate Jews from certain professions, and\r\nthe groundwork was laid for the subsequent expropriation of Jewish\r\nproperty. These laws were hailed as the fulfillment of the Nazi Party\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nThe major laws issued in this period are listed below:\r\n\r\n  Document │   Date   │Reichsge│    Title and gist of law     │Signed by\r\n    No.    │          │setzblat│                              │\r\n           │          │ t page │                              │\r\n           │          │        │                              │\r\n _1416-PS_ │   15.9.35│I 1145  │_Reichsbuergergesetz_ (Reich  │Hitler\r\n           │          │        │  Citizenship Law), first     │Frick\r\n           │          │        │  Nurnberg Law, reserving     │\r\n           │          │        │  citizenship for subjects of │\r\n           │          │        │  German blood.               │\r\n           │          │        │                              │\r\n _2000-PS_ │   15.9.35│I 1146  │_Gesetz zum Schutze des       │Hitler\r\n           │          │        │  deutschen Blutes_, (Law for │Frick\r\n           │          │        │  _protection of German_ blood│Guertner\r\n           │          │        │  and German honor),          │Hess\r\n           │          │        │  forbidding marriages and    │\r\n           │          │        │  extra-marital relations     │\r\n           │          │        │  between Jews and “Aryans”.  │\r\n           │          │        │                              │\r\n _1417-PS_ │  14.11.35│I 1333  │_Erste Verordnung zum         │Hitler\r\n           │          │        │  Reichsbuergergesetz_ (First │Frick Hess\r\n           │          │        │  regulation to Reich         │\r\n           │          │        │  citizenship law), defining  │\r\n           │          │        │  the terms “Jew” and         │\r\n           │          │        │  “part-Jew”.

The measures taken were partly presented as retaliation\r\nagainst “world Jewry” in connection with the killing of a German embassy\r\nofficial in Paris. Unlike the boycott action in April, 1933, when care\r\nwas taken to avoid violence, an allegedly “spontaneous” pogrom was\r\nstaged and carried out all over Germany on orders of Heydrich.\r\n\r\nThe organized character of the pogrom is also obvious from the admission\r\nof Heydrich and others at a meeting presided over by Goering at the Air\r\nMinistry in Berlin. (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe legislative measures which followed were discussed and approved in\r\ntheir final form at a meeting on 12 November 1938 under the chairmanship\r\nof Goering, with the participation of Frick, Funk and others. The\r\nmeeting was called following Hitler’s orders “requesting that the Jewish\r\nquestions be now, once and for all, coordinated and solved one way or\r\nanother.” The participants agreed on measures to be taken “for the\r\nelimination of the Jew from German economy.” Other possibilities, such\r\nas the establishment of ghettos, stigmatization through special\r\ninsignia, and “the main problem, namely to kick the Jew out of Germany”,\r\nwere also discussed. All these measures were later enacted as soon as\r\nconditions permitted. (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe laws issued in this period were signed mostly by Goering, in his\r\ncapacity as Deputy for the Four Year Plan, and were thus connected with\r\nthe consolidation of control over German economy in preparation for\r\naggressive war.\r\n\r\nThe major laws issued in this period are listed below:\r\n\r\n  Document │   Date   │Reichsge│    Title and gist of law     │Signed by\r\n    No.    │          │setzblat│                              │\r\n           │          │ t page │                              │\r\n           │          │        │                              │\r\n _1412-PS_ │  12.11.38│I 1579  │_Verordnung ueber eine        │Goering\r\n           │          │        │  Suhneleistung der Juden_    │\r\n           │          │        │  (Order concerning expiation │\r\n           │          │        │  contribution of Jews of     │\r\n           │          │        │  German nationality),        │\r\n           │          │        │  obligating all German Jews  │\r\n           │          │        │  to pay a collective fine of │\r\n           │          │        │  1.000.000.000 Reichsmark.   │\r\n           │          │        │                              │\r\n _2875-PS_ │  12.11.38│I 1580  │_Verordnung zur Ausschaltung  │Goering\r\n           │          │        │  der Juden aus dem deutschen │\r\n           │          │        │  Wirtschaftsleben_ (Decree on│\r\n           │          │        │  elimination of Jews from    │\r\n           │          │        │  German economic life),      │\r\n           │          │        │  barring Jews from trade and │\r\n           │          │        │  crafts.                     │\r\n           │          │        │                              │\r\n _1415-PS_ │  28.11.38│I 1676  │_Polizeiverordnung ueber das  │Heydrich\r\n           │          │        │  Auftreten der Juden in der  │(assistant\r\n           │          │        │  Queffentlichkeit_ (Police   │to Frick)\r\n           │          │        │  regulation of the appearance│\r\n           │          │        │  of Jews in public), limiting│\r\n           │          │        │  movement of Jews to certain │\r\n           │          │        │  localities and hours.       │\r\n           │          │        │                              │\r\n _1409-PS_ │   3.12.38│I 1709  │_Verordnung ueber den Einsatz │Funk Frick\r\n           │          │        │  des Juedischen Vermoegens_  │\r\n           │          │        │  (Order concerning the       │\r\n           │          │        │  Utilization of Jewish       │\r\n           │          │        │  property), setting time     │\r\n           │          │        │  limit for the sale or       │\r\n           │          │        │  liquidation of Jewish       │\r\n           │          │        │  enterprises;

The\r\nconspirators also anticipated the conquest of territories in Eastern\r\nEurope inhabitated by large numbers of Jews and the impossibility of\r\nforcing large-scale emigration in wartime. Hence, other and more drastic\r\nmeasures became necessary. The emphasis in this period shifted from\r\nlegislative acts to police measures.\r\n\r\nOn 24 January 1939 Heydrich was charged with the mission of “arriving at\r\na solution of the Jewish problem.” (_710-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 15 January 1939 Rosenberg stated in a speech at Detmold:\r\n\r\n    “For Germany the Jewish problem will be solved only when the\r\n    last Jew has left Germany.”\r\n\r\nOn 7 February 1939, Rosenberg appealed to foreign nations to forget\r\n“ideological differences” and unite against the “real enemy,” the Jew.\r\nHe advocated the creation of a “reservation” where the Jews of all\r\ncountries should be concentrated (_2843-PS_). In his Reichstag speech on\r\n30 January 1939, Hitler made the following prophecy:\r\n\r\n    “The result [of war] will be * * * the annihilation of the\r\n    Jewish race in Europe.” (_2663-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus the direction was given for a policy which was carried out as soon\r\nas the conquest of foreign territories created the material conditions.\r\n(For the carrying out and results of the program of the Nazi\r\nconspirators against Jewry, see Chapter XII.)\r\n\r\nIn the final period of the anti-Jewish crusade very few legislative\r\nmeasures were passed. The Jews were delivered to the SS and various\r\nextermination staffs. The last law dealing with the Jews in Germany,\r\nsigned by Frick, Bormann, Schwerin V. Krosigk, and Thierach, put them\r\nentirely outside the law and ordered the confiscation by the State of\r\nthe property of dead Jews (_1422-PS_). This law was a weak reflection of\r\na factual situation already in existence. Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart,\r\nassistant to Frick, stated at that time:\r\n\r\n    “The aim of the racial legislation may be regarded as already\r\n    achieved and consequently the racial legislation as essentially\r\n    closed. It led to the temporary solution of the Jewish problem\r\n    and at the same time prepared the final solution. Many\r\n    regulations will lose their practical importance as Germany\r\n    approaches the achievement of the final goal in the Jewish\r\n    problem.” (_Stuckart and Schiedermair: Rassen und Erbpflege in\r\n    der Gesetzgebung des Reiches_ (The care for Race and Heredity in\r\n    the Legislation of the Reich), Leipzig, 1943, p. 14.)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ADOPTION AND\r\n           PUBLICATION OF THE PROGRAM FOR PERSECUTION OF JEWS\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6, especially 6 (a).│  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (D) 3 │      │\r\n                │  (d).                                  │  I   │      20\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

RESHAPING OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF YOUTH\r\n\r\nA. _The Nazi conspirators reshaped the educational system._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Nazi conspirators publicly announced the purposes of their\r\neducational and training program._ Hitler stated at Elbing, Germany:\r\n\r\n    “When an opponent declares, ‘I will not come over to your side,\r\n    and you will not get me on your side,’ I calmly say, ‘Your child\r\n    belongs to me already. A people lives forever. What are you? You\r\n    will pass on. Your descendants however now stand in the new\r\n    camp. _In a short time they will know nothing else but this new\r\n    community.’_” (_2455-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler said on 1 May 1937:\r\n\r\n    “The youth of today is ever the people of tomorrow. For this\r\n    reason we have set before ourselves the task of inoculating our\r\n    youth with the spirit of this community of the people at a very\r\n    early age, at an age when human beings are still unperverted and\r\n    therefore unspoiled. * * * This Reich stands, and it is building\r\n    itself up for the future, upon its youth. And this new Reich\r\n    will give its youth to no one, _but will itself take youth and\r\n    give to youth its own education and its own upbringing_.”\r\n    (_2454-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe first sentence in the official instructors manual for high schools\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “The German school is a part of the National Socialist\r\n    Educational order. It is its obligation to form the national\r\n    socialistic personality in cooperation with the other\r\n    educational powers of the nation, but by its distinctive\r\n    educational means.” (_2453-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler stated in _Mein Kampf_:\r\n\r\n    “On this basis the whole education by the National State must\r\n    aim primarily not at the stuffing with mere knowledge, but at\r\n    the building up of bodies which are physically healthy to the\r\n    core. The development of intellectual faculties comes only after\r\n    this.” (_2392-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _They transferred responsibility for education from the states to\r\nthe Reich._ The Reich Ministry of Education was established, and control\r\nof all schools, public and private, including universities and adult\r\neducational activities, was transferred to this Reichsministry\r\n(_2078-PS_; _2088-PS_). The control of education by the local\r\nauthorities was replaced by the absolute authority of the Reich in all\r\neducational matters. (_2393-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _They changed the curricula and textbooks._\r\n\r\n_Kindergarten_: Children from two to six years were trained in more than\r\n15,000 Kindergartens operated by the Party and State. The teachers in\r\ncharge were trained in special schools that emphasized the ideological\r\nviews of the Nazi Party. The children were given a systematic training\r\nin Nazi ideology. (_2443-PS_; _2441-PS_)\r\n\r\n_Elementary schools_: Primary emphasis was placed on physical training.\r\nHistory, German race culture and mathematics were the other subjects\r\nemphasized. These subjects were taught in such a way as to emphasize the\r\ncultural superiority of the German people, the importance of race, the\r\nFuehrer principle, glorification of German war heroes, the subversive\r\nelements that caused the defeat of Germany in World War I, the shame of\r\nthe Versailles Treaty, and the rebirth of Germany under the Nazis.\r\n(_2392-PS_; _2397-PS_; _2441-PS_; _2394-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to education in the schools all children from six to ten\r\nyears were registered in the _Kindergruppen_ (Children’s Groups)\r\nconducted by the National Socialist _Frauenschaft_ (National Socialist\r\nWomen’s Organization). All children were required to obtain an\r\nefficiency record card and uniform and were instructed in Nazi ideology\r\nby the members of the Women’s Organization. (_2441-PS_; _2452-PS_)\r\n\r\n_High Schools_ (Hoeheren Schule): The curricula and organization of the\r\n_Hoeheren_ School was modified by a series of decrees of the Minister of\r\nEducation in order to make these schools effective instruments for the\r\nteaching of the Nazi doctrines. A new curricula emphasizing physical\r\ntraining, German war history, and race culture was introduced.\r\n(_2453-PS_)\r\n\r\n_Universities_: The schools of politics and physical education became\r\nthe largest colleges at the universities. Beginning in 1933 the Nazis\r\nintroduced courses in heredity and race culture, ancient and modern\r\nGerman history, biology and geopolitics. (_2443-PS_; _2441-PS_)\r\n\r\nTextbooks in the schools were changed to accord with the expressed\r\nobjectives of the Nazi conspirators. (_2446-PS_; _2442-PS_; _2444-PS_;\r\n_2445-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _The Nazi conspirators acquired domination and control over all\r\nteachers._ The law for the reestablishing of the professional civil\r\nservice made it possible for the Nazi conspirators thoroughly to\r\nreexamine all German teachers and to remove all “harmful and\r\nuntrustworthy” elements (_1397-PS_; _2392-PS_). Many teachers and\r\nprofessors (mostly Jewish) were dismissed and were replaced with “State\r\nspirited” teachers (_2392-PS_). All teachers were required to take an\r\noath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler. (_2061-PS_). All teachers were\r\nrequired to belong to the National Socialist _Lehrerbund_ (National\r\nSocialist Teachers League), which organization was charged with the\r\ntraining of all teachers in the theories and doctrines of the NSDAP.\r\n(_2452-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1934 the National Socialist Teachers League was declared to be the\r\nofficial organ of German education. (_2393-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Civil Service Act of 1937 required the teachers to be “the executors\r\nof the will of the party-supported State.” It required them to be ready\r\nat “any time to defend without reservation the National Socialist\r\nState.” The law required the teachers to participate strenuously in\r\nelections, have thorough knowledge of Party principles and literature,\r\nrender the Hitler Salute, send their children to the Hitler Youth, and\r\neducate them in the Nazi spirit (_2340-PS_). Before taking their second\r\nexamination (required for permanent appointment), teachers in Prussia\r\nwere required to show service in the SA and in the _Arbeitsdienst_\r\n(Labor Service) (_2392-PS_). Candidates for teaching and other public\r\npositions were required to have “proved themselves” in the Hitler Jugend\r\n(_2451-PS_; _2900-PS_). Teachers’ academies were judged by the Minister\r\nof Education on their ability to turn out men and women with new ideas\r\n“based on blood and soil”. (_2394-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe leadership principle replaced the democratic school principle. A\r\ndecree of the Reich Minister of Education made the head of any school\r\nfully responsible for the conduct of the institution in line with the\r\nofficial party ideology. Teachers committees and Student Committees were\r\nabolished (_2393-PS_; _2392-PS_). A “confidential instructor,” the\r\nschool youth warden of the Hitler Jugend, appointed by the Hitler Youth\r\nauthorities, was assigned to each school (_2396-PS_). The “Parents\r\nAdvisory Committees” in the public schools were dissolved, and replaced\r\nby the “School Communities,” (_Schulgemeinde_). The headmaster was the\r\nleader. He appointed, after consultation with the local party leader,\r\ntwo to five teachers or parents, known as “_Jugendwalter_,” (Youth\r\nAdvisors) and one Hitler Youth leader, who was appointed after\r\nconsultation with the Hitler Youth officials in the district\r\n(_2399-PS_). The duties of the “School Community” were to bring to the\r\nattention of the public the educational objectives of the Nazi Party,\r\nincluding race questions, heredity indoctrination, physical training,\r\nand the Youth League activities. The function of advising the school\r\nauthorities, formerly performed by the “Parents Advisory Committees,”\r\nwas eliminated by the decree. (_2399-PS_)\r\n\r\n_Universities_: The Leadership Principle was introduced into the\r\nuniversities. The _Rektor_ (head of the university) was appointed by the\r\nReich Minister of Education for an unspecified period of time and was\r\nresponsible only to the Reichs Minister. The University was divided into\r\nthe _Dozentenschaft_ (Lecturers Corps) and the _Studentenschaft_\r\n(Student Corps). The leaders of these two bodies were also appointed by\r\nthe Reichsminister of Education (_2394-PS_). The teaching staff of the\r\nuniversity was subject to the control of the National Socialist\r\n_Dozentenbund_ (NSDoB) (Nazi Association of University Lecturers). The\r\npurposes of the NSDoB were:\r\n\r\n(_a_) to take a decisive part in the selection of lecturers and to\r\nproduce candidates for the teaching staff who were wholly Nazi in their\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\n(_b_) to train all university lecturers in Nazi ideology,\r\n\r\n(_c_) to see that the entire university life was run in accordance with\r\nthe philosophy of the Party. (_2452-PS_; _318-PS_)\r\n\r\nAll German students at the universities were required to belong to the\r\n_Studentenschaft_ (Student Corps) (_2084-PS_). The Student Corps was\r\nresponsible for making the students conscious of their duties to the\r\nNazis, and was obliged to promote enrollment in the SA and labor\r\nservice. Physical training of students was the responsibility of the SA.\r\nPolitical education was the responsibility of the\r\n_National-Sozialistische Deutsche Studentenbund_ (NSDStB), (National\r\nSocialist German Student Bund) (_2458-PS_). The National Socialist\r\nStudent Bund (NSDStB) was the Nazi “elite” of the student body and was\r\nresponsible for the leadership of the university students, and all\r\nleaders of the Student Corps were appointed from its membership. The\r\nNazi Student Bund was solely responsible for the entire ideological and\r\npolitical education of the students. (_2395-PS_; _2399-PS_; _2441-PS_;\r\n_2392-PS_; _2393-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Nazi conspirators supplemented the school system by training the\r\nyouth through the Hitler Jugend._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Nazi conspirators from their early days expressed their belief\r\nin the fundamental importance of controlling the education and training\r\nof youth._ Hitler stated in _Mein Kampf_:\r\n\r\n    “It is precisely our German people, that today broken down, lies\r\n    defenseless against the kicks of the rest of the world who need\r\n    that suggestive force that lies in self-confidence. But this\r\n    _self-confidence has to be instilled_ into the young\r\n    fellow-citizen from childhood on. His entire education and\r\n    development has to be directed at giving him _the conviction_\r\n    _of being absolutely superior to others_. With this physical\r\n    force and skill he has again to win the belief in the\r\n    invincibility of his entire nationality. For what once led the\r\n    German army to victory was the sum of the confidence which the\r\n    individual and all in common had in their leaders. The\r\n    confidence in _the possibility of regaining its freedom_ is what\r\n    will restore the German people. But this conviction must be the\r\n    final product of the same feeling of millions of individuals.”\r\n    (_404-PS_; see also _2901-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain in _Mein Kampf_ Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “The racial State will have to see to it that there will be a\r\n    generation which by a suitable education will be ready for the\r\n    final and ultimate decision on this globe. The nation which\r\n    enters first on this course will be the victorious one.”\r\n    (_404-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe law of the Hitler Youth provides in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The future of the German nation depends on its youth, and the\r\n    German youth shall have to be prepared for its future duties. *\r\n    * *\r\n\r\n    “The German youth besides being reared within the family and\r\n    school, shall be educated physically, intellectually and morally\r\n    in the spirit of National Socialism to serve the people and\r\n    community, through the Hitler Youth.” (_1392-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1938 Hitler said in a speech to the youth:\r\n\r\n    “Since the victory of the Movement, under whose banner you\r\n    stand, there has been completed within our people the\r\n    unification of heart (innere Einigung) of the Germans. And as\r\n    wages for this work of ours Providence has given us Greater\r\n    Germany (Grossdeutschland). _This unification is no gift of\r\n    chance, it is the result of a systematic education of our people\r\n    by the National Socialist Movement._ . . . . And this education\r\n    begins with the individual at an age when he is not already\r\n    burdened with preconceived ideas. The youth is the stone which\r\n    is to go to the building of our new Reich! You are Greater\r\n    Germany! In you is being formed the community of the German\r\n    people. Before the single leader there stands a Reich, before\r\n    the single Reich stands a people, and before the single people\r\n    stands German youth! When I see you my faith in the future of\r\n    Germany has no bounds, nothing can shake it. For I know that you\r\n    will fulfill all that we hope of you. So I greet you today on\r\n    this 1st of May in our new great Germany: for you are our\r\n    spring. In you will and shall be completed that for which\r\n    generations and centuries have striven, Germany!” (_2454-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Nazi conspirators destroyed or took over all other youth\r\norganizations._ The first Nazi youth League (_Nationalsocialistischen\r\nJugendbund_) was organized in 1922. In 1925 the Hitler Youth was\r\nofficially recognized by the Nazi Party and became a Junior Branch of\r\nthe SA. In 1931 Baldur von Schirach was appointed Reichs Youth Leader of\r\nthe NSDAP with the rank of SA _Gruppenfuehrer_. (_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhen the Nazi conspirators came to power the Hitler Jugend was a minor\r\norganization among many youth associations in Germany. At the end of\r\n1932 it had only 107,956 members—less than 5 percent of the total youth\r\npopulation of Germany (_2435-PS_). Schirach was appointed\r\n“_Jugendfuehrer des Deutschen Reichs_” (Youth Leader of the German\r\nReich), in June 1933. In this position he was directly responsible to\r\nHitler for the education and training of the German youth outside of the\r\nhome and school in accordance with the ideology of the Nazi Party.\r\n(_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn June of 1933 on orders of Schirach, an armed band of Hitler youths\r\noccupied by force the headquarters of the Reich Committee of The German\r\nYouth Associations and took over all files and personnel records of the\r\nyouth leagues represented by the Committee. By the same method the\r\noffices and property (including all youth hostels in Germany) of the\r\nReich Association for German Youth Hostels was seized, and a Nazi\r\nrepresentative of Schirach put in charge (_1458-PS_). By decree dated 22\r\nJune 1933 Schirach dissolved the Grossdeutsches Bund and all of its\r\naffiliated organizations and took over their property; he dissolved The\r\nReich Committee of The German Youth Associations, and required all other\r\nyouth organizations to make a complete report of all organizational\r\ninformation, including names of all officers and members and inventory\r\nof all funds and property (_2229-PS_). The Youth Associations of all\r\npolitical parties and of all labor organizations were dissolved by\r\ndecree of Schirach. By virtue of these decrees all youth organizations\r\nexcept those sponsored by the Catholic and Protestant Churches were\r\nabolished or incorporated in the Hitler Jugend (_1458-PS_; _2260-PS_).\r\nThe Nazi-appointed Reichsbishop Mueller entered into an agreement with\r\nSchirach which transferred all members of the Evangelical Youth to the\r\nHitler Jugend and provided that the Hitler Jugend alone would provide\r\nthe state political and physical education of the Protestant youth. By\r\nthe end of 1933 only the Catholic Youth organization remained untouched.\r\n(_1458-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Concordat entered into with the Holy See on July 20, 1933 provided\r\nfor the continuance of the Catholic Youth Association (_2655-PS_).\r\nContrary to the provisions of the Concordat, the Nazi conspirators\r\nimmediately set out to smash the Catholic Youth organization and to\r\nforce all young people into the Hitler Youth. Ten days after the signing\r\nof the Concordat, Schirach issued an order forbidding simultaneous\r\nmembership in the Hitler Jugend and the Catholic Youth League\r\n(_2456-PS_). In 1934 Schirach wrote, “The denominational youth league\r\n(Catholic Youth Association) has no right to exist in our time.”\r\n(_1458-PS_). A year later Catholic youth associations were forbidden to\r\nwear uniforms, to assemble publicly, to wear insignia, or to engage in\r\noutdoor sport activity (_1482-PS_). Additional pressure was exerted on\r\nthe Catholic Youth by the requirement of membership in the Hitler Youth\r\nas a prerequisite of public employment (_2451-PS_; _2900-PS_). Finally,\r\nin 1937, Schirach announced:\r\n\r\n    “_The struggle for the unification of the German Youth is\r\n    finished._ I considered it as my duty to conduct it in a hard\r\n    and uncompromising manner. Many might not have realized why we\r\n    went through so much trouble for the sake of the youth. And yet\r\n    the National Socialist German Workers Party, whose trustee I\r\n    felt I always was and always will be, this party considered _the\r\n    struggle for the youth as the decisive element_ for the future\r\n    of the German nation.” (_2306-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Nazi conspirators made membership in the Hitler Jugend\r\ncompulsory._ The Hitler Youth Law of 1936 provided that “All of the\r\nGerman Youth in the Reich is organized within the Hitler Youth.”\r\n(_1392-PS_). Executive decrees later implemented this law by the\r\nestablishment of severe penalties against anyone who deterred a youth\r\nfrom service in the Hitler Jugend, and confirmed the policy of excluding\r\nJews from membership.\r\n\r\nThe Hitler Jugend had been from its inception a formation of the Nazi\r\nParty. By virtue of the 1936 Youth Law it became an agency of the Reich\r\nGovernment while still retaining its position as a formation of the Nazi\r\nParty. (_1392-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe membership statistics of the Hitler Jugend to 1940 were:\r\n\r\n                End 1932                          107,956\r\n                End 1933                        2,292,041\r\n                End 1934                        3,577,565\r\n                End 1935                        3,943,303\r\n                End 1936                        5,437,601\r\n                End 1937                        5,879,955\r\n                End 1938                        7,031,226\r\n                End 1939                        7,728,259\r\n\r\nAnd BDM (League of German Girls)—440,789. (_2435-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Through the Hitler Jugend the Nazi conspirators imbued the youth\r\nwith Nazi ideology and prepared them for membership in the Party and its\r\nformations._ Schirach said:\r\n\r\n    “I am responsible to the Reich that the entire youth of Germany\r\n    will be educated physically, morally and spiritually in the\r\n    spirit of the National Socialist Idea of the State.” (_2306-PS_)\r\n\r\n_Mein Kampf_ was regarded as the “Bible” of the Hitler Jugend\r\n(_1458-PS_). On entering the _Jungvolk_ at the age of 10, children took\r\nthe following oath:\r\n\r\n    “In the presence of this blood-banner which represents our\r\n    Fuehrer I swear to devote all my energies, and my strength to\r\n    the Savior of our Country, Adolf Hitler. I am willing and ready\r\n    to give up my life for him, so help me God. One People, one\r\n    Reich, one Fuehrer.” (_2441-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Hitler Jugend organization operated solely on the Leadership\r\nPrinciple. The leader was always appointed from above and the leader’s\r\nwill was absolute. (_1458-PS_; _2306-PS_; _2436-PS_; _2438-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Master Race doctrine and anti-semitism, including physical attacks\r\non the Jews, was taught systematically in the Hitler Jugend training\r\nprogram. (_2436-PS_; _L-360-H_; _2441-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Hitler Jugend indoctrinated the youth with the idea that war is a\r\nnoble activity. (_1458-PS_; _2436-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Hitler Jugend, in accordance with the policy of the Nazi Party,\r\nemphasized the importance and demanded the return of the colonies which\r\nhad been taken from Germany by the “Versailles Shame Dictate.”\r\n(_1458-PS_; _2436-PS_; _2440-PS_; _2441-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Hitler Jugend taught that the guiding principle of German policy was\r\nthe utilization of the space to the East (_1458-PS_; _2439-PS_). All\r\nactivities carried on in support of the demands for modification of the\r\nVersailles Treaty, the restoration of colonies, and the acquisition of\r\nadditional living space were closely coordinated with the (VDA) _Verein\r\nfuer das Deutschtum in Ausland_ (Office of Germans in foreign\r\ncountries). (_L-360-H_)\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the program of indoctrination of the youth, more\r\nthan 765,000 were actively engaged as Hitler Youth leaders by May 1939.\r\nYouth leaders were thoroughly trained, many of them in special “Youth\r\nLeaders” schools (_2435-PS_). More than 200,000 political indoctrination\r\nmeetings (_Heimabend_) were held weekly. Each community was required by\r\nlaw to provide a suitable meeting house for the Hitler Jugend. Training\r\nand propaganda films were produced on an elaborate scale. In the winter\r\nof 1937-38 more than three million youths attended showings of these\r\nfilms. The Hitler Jugend press and propaganda office published at least\r\nthirteen magazines and large numbers of other publications and yearbooks\r\nappealing to all age groups and to the various interest groups of the\r\nyouth. (_2435-PS_)\r\n\r\nOne of the most important functions of the Hitler Jugend was to prepare\r\nthe youth for membership in the Party and its formations. Hitler said at\r\nthe Reichsparteitag, 1935:\r\n\r\n    “He alone, who owns the youth, gains the Future! Practical\r\n    consequences of this doctrine: The boy will enter the _Jungvolk_\r\n    (boy 10-14) and the _Pimpf_ (members of the _Jungvolk_) will\r\n    come to the Hitler Youth, and the boy of the Hitler Youth will\r\n    join the SA, the SS and the other formations, and the SA man and\r\n    the SS man will one day join the Labor Service, and from there\r\n    he will go to the Armed Forces, and the soldiers of the people\r\n    will return again to the organization of Movement, the Party,\r\n    the SA, the SS, and never again will our people be so depraved\r\n    as they were at one time.” (_2656-PS_; _2401-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Streifendienst_, a special formation of the Hitler Jugend, was\r\norganized by virtue of an agreement between Himmler and Schirach for the\r\npurpose of securing and training recruits for the SS, with special\r\nemphasis on securing recruits for the Deaths Head Troops of the SS\r\n(concentration camp guards). (_2396-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe farm service section of the Hitler Jugend also became a cadet corps\r\nof the SS by reason of the agreement entered into between Himmler and\r\nSchirach in 1938. This formation was to train for SS membership youths\r\nespecially suited to become _Wehrbauer_ (militant peasants), who were to\r\nbe settled in places where the Nazis needed especially trained farmers.\r\n(_2567-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1937 the Adolf Hitler Schools were established in order to\r\nindoctrinate boys selected by the Party to be the future leaders of the\r\nNazi state. The schools were operated by the Hitler Jugend for the\r\nParty. Boys entered at the age of 12 and remained in the school until 18\r\nyears of age. (_2653-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _The Nazi conspirators used the Hitler Jugend for extensive\r\npre-military training of youth._ In 1933 the Hitler Youth, in\r\ncooperation with the SA and the Wehrmacht, entered into a secret program\r\nof extensive pre-military training of the youth (_1850-PS_). Extensive\r\npre-military training was carried on in all age groups of the Hitler\r\nYouth in close cooperation with the Wehrmacht. (_2438-PS_; _2441-PS_;\r\n_1992-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to general military training, specialized training was given\r\nin special formations. These included:\r\n\r\n    Hitler Jugend Flying Units\r\n\r\n    Hitler Jugend Naval Units\r\n\r\n    Hitler Jugend Motorized Units\r\n\r\n    Hitler Jugend Signal Units\r\n\r\n    Hitler Jugend Medical Units\r\n\r\n    Hitler Jugend Musical Units. (_2654-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe extent of the military training in 1937 was set out by Hitler in a\r\nspeech at Berlin.\r\n\r\n    “The Naval Hitler Youth comprises 45,000 boys, the Motor Hitler\r\n    Youth 60,000 boys. As part of the campaign for the encouragement\r\n    of aviation 55,000 members of the Jungvolk were trained in\r\n    gliding for group activities; 74,000 boys of the Hitler Youth\r\n    are organized in its flying units; 15,000 boys passed their\r\n    gliding test in the year 1937 alone.\r\n\r\n    “Today 1,200,000 boys of the Hitler Youth receive regular\r\n    instructions in small-bore rifle shooting from 7,000\r\n    instructors.” (_2454-PS_; see also _2441-PS_.)\r\n\r\nA formal agreement between the Wehrmacht and the Hitler Jugend was\r\npublished 11 August 1939. It recites that whereas 30,000 Hitler Jugend\r\nleaders had been trained annually in shooting and field exercises, the\r\nnumber would be doubled; that 60,000,000 shots had been fired in Hitler\r\nYouth training courses in 1938 and that a considerable increase in the\r\nfigure was expected. The agreement recognized the close cooperation that\r\nexisted between the Hitler Jugend and the Wehrmacht in the military\r\ntraining of youth and provided for a far more extensive program.\r\n(_2398-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO RESHAPING OF\r\n                    EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF YOUTH\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6, especially 6 (a).│  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (D) 3 │      │\r\n                │  (e).                                  │  I   │      21\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

Its functions were:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To direct, supervise and synchronize propaganda within the Nazi\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n    “Propaganda of the NSDAP, its formations and affiliated\r\n    associations is the responsibility of the\r\n    _Reichspropagandaleiter_.\r\n\r\n    “He determines all manifestations of the Movement, including its\r\n    formations and affiliated associations, with regard to\r\n    propaganda.\r\n\r\n    “He issues the directives for the Party, including its\r\n    formations and affiliated associations, for the realization of\r\n    the cultural wishes of the Fuehrer.” (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese functions were organized vertically through a close network of\r\n_Gauleiters_, _Kreisleiters_, and _Ortsgruppenleiters_ which reached\r\neven the smallest communities. In addition, synchronization of\r\npropaganda within the Movement was guaranteed through the _Reichsring\r\nfuer National-Sozialistische Propaganda und Volksaufklaerung_, (National\r\nSocialist Organization for Propaganda and People’s Enlightenment), an\r\noffice within the _Reichspropagandaleitung_. The _Reichsring_\r\nconstituted the center of control responsible for the complete\r\ncoordination of Party and Movement in the field of propaganda.\r\n\r\n    “The _Reichsring_ * * * had the task to ensure the uniform\r\n    direction of propaganda of all formations and affiliated\r\n    associations through the Party.” (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) To imbue the Nazi Movement and the people with Nazi ideology.\r\n\r\n    “(The _Reichspropagandaleiter_) upon his initiative, is\r\n    concerned with the permeation of German people with the National\r\n    Socialist ideology.\r\n\r\n    “He enlightens the people about the achievements of Party and\r\n    State.\r\n\r\n    “He controls the entire German wireless system with regard to\r\n    its internal organizational, cultural and economic\r\n    possibilities;\r\n\r\n    “Press, radio and film are in the service of propaganda.”\r\n    (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\n(c) To coordinate Party propaganda with that of the Reich Government.\r\n\r\n    “The liaison officer has the task of centralizing all contacts\r\n    with the Reich Ministries, public authorities, and corporations\r\n    and to establish all such contacts with same * * *”. (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) To investigate the effectiveness of Nazi propaganda. This function\r\nwas assigned to the lower grades of the Party leadership, and to\r\nregional and local officials, who assembled and analyzed information on\r\npublic reaction to the current content of propaganda.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Other activities of the _Reichspropagandaleitung_ were discharged\r\nby numerous functional departments which included, _inter alia_,\r\n“_Hauptstellen_” (Main Bureaus) or offices for the following:\r\n\r\n_1._ _Press_—preparation of all propaganda material issued by\r\n       _Reichspropagandaleitung_ for dissemination to newspapers.\r\n_2._ _Exhibits and fairs_—supervision of propaganda aspects of exhibits\r\n       and fairs in which the Party participated.\r\n_3._ _Mass or “Aktive” propaganda_—organization of propaganda campaigns\r\n       within the movement; training and supplying speakers with\r\n       propaganda materials.\r\n_4._ _Films_—Popularization of Nazi-inspired films; photographing official\r\n       rallies.\r\n_5._ _Radio_—radio propaganda.\r\n_6._ _Culture_—making all forms of art conform to Nazi standards.\r\n\r\nOther Bureaus included Architecture, Style and Design, Works of Art,\r\nFormulation of Programs, and Training of Speakers. (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Reichspropagandaleitung_ was regionally organized into _Gau-_,\r\n_Kreis-_, and _Ortsgruppenpropagandaaemter_ (_Gau_, district, and local\r\npropaganda offices). The _Gaupropagandaleiter_ (leader of the _Gau_\r\npropaganda office) was at the same time the _Gau_ representative of the\r\nChamber of Culture (_Landeskulturwalter_) and in most cases also\r\nrepresented the regional office of the Propaganda Ministry, so that on\r\nthe lower levels, Party and State propaganda were completely unified.\r\n(_2315-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The office of Reichspressechef_ (Reich Press Chief).\r\n\r\nThe office of Reich Press Chief of the NSDAP was created in 1934 by\r\ndecree of the Fuehrer (_2319-PS_). The functions of this office were\r\nexclusive:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Press Office of the NSDAP is the central office for\r\n    the entire political publishing activity of the Party. It\r\n    represents the press interests of the Reich leadership of the\r\n    NSDAP _vis a vis_ both the German and the foreign press. It\r\n    alone has the authority to issue directives to the press of\r\n    Reich policies concerning the treatment of Party affairs. It\r\n    alone has the authority to issue press directives to all offices\r\n    of Reich leadership. It is responsible for the political and\r\n    editorial preparations, execution and utilization of all\r\n    important Party activities in the Reich. It supplies the\r\n    domestic and foreign press with information, news and\r\n    commentaries about the Party. It keeps a record of press\r\n    reaction to the Party work in publications of the domestic and\r\n    foreign press.” (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Reich Press Chief exercised control over all press offices,\r\nincluding the chief editors of the National Socialist newspapers, as\r\nwell as the _Gau_ press wardens of the Party. He also served as liaison\r\nofficer between the Party press and the “Independent” press, and between\r\nParty and Government. (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe executive functions of the Reich Press Chief were carried out by two\r\noffices:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Pressepolitisches Amt_ (Press Political Office).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Pressepersonalamt_ (Press Personnel Office), which was in\r\ncharge of training journalists and keeping files on German and foreign\r\njournalists.\r\n\r\nThe vertical organization of press controls, corresponding to that of\r\nthe _Reichspropagandaleitung_, included _Gau-_, _Kreis-_ and\r\n_Ortsgruppen_ departments. Each was headed by an _Amtsleiter_, or press\r\nwarden, who was responsible for the entire Party press within his sphere\r\nof jurisdiction. He supervised the editorial policy of the Party press,\r\nissued information bulletins about the activities of the Movement, and\r\nserved as liaison officer between the Party and non-Party press. He also\r\ntransmitted local information to headquarters for distribution and made\r\nrecommendations concerning the appointments of local party editors. The\r\n_Gau-_ and _Kreis-_ press wardens, at the same time, served as regional\r\nand local representatives of the Home Press Division of the Propaganda\r\nMinistry and of the Reich Press Chamber. (_2319-PS_; _2315-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Reichsleiter fuer die Presse_ (Reich Press Leader).\r\n\r\nThe Reich Press Leader, Max Amann, was charged with supervising all\r\nmatters concerning the German publishing business. The\r\n_Organisationsbuch der NSDAP_ (1937) described his function as follows:\r\n\r\n    “He is charged with the creation of a press for the German\r\n    people, which is responsible and answerable to him, and which\r\n    reflects the life and experiences of the German people’s\r\n    community. In addition, the Reichsleiter for Press has the\r\n    function of issuing regulations necessary to carry out the\r\n    demands concerning publication policies established in Article\r\n    23 of the Party Program and to supervise their execution.”\r\n    (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nArticle 23 of the Party Platform referred to above, provided, _inter\r\nalia_, that (a) all editors and newspaper personnel must be “members of\r\nthe nation”; (b) non-Germans are prohibited from financial participation\r\nin, or influence of, newspapers; (c) the publication of papers “which do\r\nnot conduce to the national welfare” is prohibited; (d) tendencies in\r\nart or literature “of a kind likely to disintegrate our life as a\r\nnation” will be prosecuted; and (e) “institutions which militate against\r\nthe requirements mentioned above” will be suppressed. (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus the Reich Press Leader was not only empowered to control all\r\npublishing houses of the Party, but was assigned the task of bringing\r\nthe entire German press into line with National Socialist ideology. To\r\nthis end he was given wide and specific powers.\r\n\r\nHis sphere of jurisdiction included specifically:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The administration, publishing, and financing of the Party press;\r\n\r\n(_b_) The establishment of newspapers by Party members or affiliated\r\nassociations;\r\n\r\n(_c_) The incorporation of newspapers into the Party press combine;\r\n\r\n(_d_) The appointment of publishers and of their deputies;\r\n\r\n(_e_) The termination or alteration of contracts with newspapers;\r\n\r\n(_f_) The appointment of Commissars to supervise publishing houses.\r\n(_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to controlling the administration and finance of the\r\nNational Socialist publishing houses in the _Gau_, the Press Leader\r\nheaded the _Zentralverlag_, which was the central publishing house and\r\nholding company of the entire Party publishing machine and all its\r\nofficial organs, such as _Der Voelkischer Beobachter_, _Der Angriff_,\r\n_Der SA Mann_, _Das Schwarze Korps_, _Die HJ_, etc. (_3016-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was one of the Reich Press Leader’s duties to turn all publishing by\r\nParty officials into a lucrative undertaking, and to set up an absolute\r\nmonopoly in the publication of all political literature. To effectuate\r\nthat objective, a decree was passed which made it mandatory for all\r\n“manuscripts which have National Socialist problems and subject matter\r\nas themes” to be offered first to _Eher Verlag_ publication. (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Reichsleiter fuer die Press_, who was also president of the Reich\r\nPress Chamber, exercised economic controls over the entire German press.\r\nHe made use of his position to expand the Party publishing machine at\r\nthe expense of non-party newspapers. As president of the Reich Press\r\nChamber, he was authorized to issue directives with the force of law. In\r\nthat capacity he issued certain regulations which had the effect of\r\nprohibiting the ownership of newspapers by corporations of any kind,\r\nexcept the NSDAP or such groups as were approved by the Party.\r\n(_2315-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese decrees enabled Amann to close down one or more papers in a\r\nparticular locality “to safeguard reasonable standards of competition.”\r\nThey thus provided, along with racial and other discriminatory\r\nlegislation, the “legal” basis for the pressure which was brought to\r\nbear on such publishing firms as Ullstein and other opposition\r\npublications, in order to force them to sell out to the Party. These\r\nsales were in no sense voluntary; the alternative in each case was total\r\nsuppression. The authorizing decree provided:\r\n\r\n    “The President of the Reich Chamber of the Press will therefore\r\n    endeavor at first in every individual case to effect agreements\r\n    which will relieve him of the necessity of issuing orders for\r\n    the closing of establishments.” (_2315-PS_)\r\n\r\nMax Amann has admitted in an affidavit that he discharged his duties as\r\nReich Press Leader consistently with the statement of his functions\r\ncontained in the Party Organization Book and with Article 23 of the\r\nParty Program. He has further stated that racial and other\r\ndiscriminatory legislation made it expedient for firms “owned or\r\ncontrolled by Jewish interests, or by political or religious interests\r\nhostile to the NSDAP * * * to sell their newspapers or assets to the\r\nEher concern”; and that there was “no free market for the sale of such\r\nproperties and the Franz Eher Verlag was generally the only bidder.” His\r\naffidavit concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n    “It is a true statement to say that the basic purpose of the\r\n    Nazi press program was to eliminate all press in opposition to\r\n    the Party.” (_3016-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Parteiamliche Prufungskommission zum Schutz des NS-Christums_\r\n(Office of Party Examining Commission for the Protection of National\r\nSocialist Publications) (PPK).\r\n\r\nThe PPK was charged with the censorship and supervision of all\r\nliterature with cultural or political implications. According to the\r\nParty Manual:\r\n\r\n    “The functional scope of the official Party Examining Commission\r\n    is not confined to any one group of publications but includes\r\n    the entire publishing field. Thus the work of the Official Party\r\n    Examining Commission is sub-divided into departments for books,\r\n    magazines and newspapers. Out of these main departments a group\r\n    of important special fields have emerged as more or less\r\n    independent fields. They are specifically the editing of\r\n    speeches, scientific books, textbooks, scientific periodicals\r\n    and the calendar as a special type of magazine.” (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Examining Commission’s function was to protect National Socialist\r\nliterature from attempts to destroy its propagandistic effect or to\r\npervert its political and social content. The Party Manual stated:\r\n\r\n    “It is the function of the Examining Commission to protect the\r\n    National Socialist literature from abuse, corruption, and\r\n    attempts at dissolution. Thus it forestalls the infiltration of\r\n    elements within the National Socialist literature which are\r\n    irreconcilable with it.” (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PPK concerned itself with the actual suppression of\r\nliterature incompatible with Party tenets, and with the approval of\r\nthose works which it deemed beneficial to the extension of the National\r\nSocialist ideology. The Party Manual specified as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Particularly it is the function of the official Party Examining\r\n    Commission to determine whether or not a work can be considered\r\n    National Socialist literature.” (_2319-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis office worked in close collaboration with the Delegate of the\r\nFuehrer for the Total Supervision of the Intellectual and Ideological\r\nTraining and Education of the People (Rosenberg). (_2319-PS_; _2383-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _The Beauftragte des Fuehrers fuer die Ueberwachung der gesamten\r\ngeistigen und weltansschaulichen Schulung und Erziehung der NSDAP_\r\n(Delegate of the Fuehrer for the Total Supervision of the Intellectual\r\nand Ideological Training and Education of the Party) (BdF).\r\n\r\nThe delegate of the Fuehrer was _Reichsleiter_ Alfred Rosenberg. The\r\nOffice of the BdF was placed in charge of the Party’s intellectual and\r\nideological training and education. Its declared objective was the\r\nuniform ideological orientation of the Party, Party formations, and\r\naffiliated associations. Its main functions, in furtherance of this\r\nobjective, were the preparation of suitable training materials and the\r\nissuance of directives thereon; the preparation, editing, and\r\nestablishment of curricula; the training of qualified teaching staffs;\r\nthe counseling of Party agencies, formations, and affiliates on content\r\nand methods of indoctrination; and the elimination of such reading and\r\nteaching materials as were deemed inappropriate from a National\r\nSocialist point of view. To perform these tasks, Rosenberg had the\r\nassistance of a large organization with numerous functional divisions\r\n(_2319-PS_). The BdF took a major part in the work of Party\r\norganizations, affiliated associations, and schools and training\r\ninstitutes which were instrumental in the indoctrination of the German\r\npeople and youth. (_2383-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Reich government organization._\r\n\r\nThe state organ of control was the _Reichsministerium fuer\r\nVolksaufklaerung und Propaganda_ (Reich Ministry for Popular\r\nEnlightenment and Propaganda). The Minister was Josef Goebbels. The\r\nMinistry was founded by decree dated 13 March 1933, which defined its\r\nduties as the “enlightenment of, and propaganda among, the people on the\r\nsubject of the policy of the Reich government and on the national\r\nreconstruction of the homeland.” (_2029-PS_). By decree dated 30 June\r\n1933 the functions of the Minister were extended to include\r\n“jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual indoctrination of the\r\nnation, of propagandizing the State, of cultural and economic\r\npropaganda, of enlightenment of the public at home and abroad;\r\nfurthermore he is in charge of all institutions serving these purposes.”\r\n(_2030-PS_). In the words of Mueller, an authority on the Propaganda\r\nMinistry, these decrees formed the basis for the creation of a central\r\nagency for propaganda “the like of which heretofore existed nowhere in\r\nthe world.” (_2434-PS_). The influence which this agency exerted on the\r\neveryday life and activities of the German citizen was illustrated by\r\nthe multitude of civic and cultural affairs, including public\r\nentertainment, which fell under the sweep of its direction and control.\r\n(_2434-PS_)\r\n\r\nA few of the more important departments of the Propaganda Ministry,\r\ntogether with a brief description of their respective functions,\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(1) _Personnel._ This department issued directives for unified personnel\r\npolicy, and exercised general supervision over the personnel of public\r\nart instituted within the entire Reich.\r\n\r\n(2) _Law._ “The nuclear task of the law department is the publication\r\nand execution of national socialist cultural laws. The professions and\r\ninstitutions of literature and art had to be transformed from carriers\r\nof a liberal individualistic intellectual movement to the carriers of\r\nthe tasks of public propaganda and leadership. To reach this goal\r\nrequired the enactment of governmental decrees for creating new\r\norganizations or the making of new laws.”\r\n\r\n(3) _Propaganda._ This department coordinated propaganda policies and\r\nissued over-all directives to the various functional departments (press,\r\nradio, etc.) which then carried out the directives. A special function\r\nwas “enlightenment of the people as to Jewish question” and as to\r\n“racial policies.”\r\n\r\n(4) _Foreign._ This department was the Ministry’s listening post for\r\npolitical and economic developments abroad “to counteract the worldwide\r\npublicity activities of the enemy against our philosophy and our\r\npolitical objectives by exposing and rectifying the lies of the press”\r\nand to exploit the information in German propaganda. It also cooperated\r\nclosely with the _Auslandsorganization der NSDAP_.\r\n\r\n(5) _Radio._ Hans Fritzsche headed this department. It supervised the\r\npolitical content of German broadcasting, issued directives as to the\r\narrangement of programs and treatment of material, and cooperated with\r\nthe Party in the technical organization of German radio.\r\n\r\n(6) The _Film Department_ was in charge of directing and guiding the\r\nGerman film industry, censoring of films, and developing the German\r\nweekly newsreel.\r\n\r\n(7) _Literature._ This agency, in close collaboration with BdF and PPK,\r\ncontrolled all German literary activities, censored new books, provided\r\nfor the publication of German books abroad, and arranged for the\r\ntranslation and censorship of foreign books.\r\n\r\n(8) _Abteilung Deutsche Presse_ (German or Home Press Department). This\r\ndepartment was headed by Fritzsche until he was relieved in 1942 to take\r\ncharge of the Radio Division. It was responsible for political control\r\nover the entire German press; it controlled the editorial policy of the\r\npress and its personnel (through the Reich Press Chamber), and\r\nsupervised the dissemination of news through the official German News\r\nAgency (DNB). The Home Press Division outlined the editorial policy of\r\nall newspapers and the comment of editors and journalists in its daily\r\ndirectives. (_Tendenz berichte_). These dealt with the daily contents of\r\nthe paper, the methods of treatment of news material, the writing of\r\nheadlines, the preference for or omission of certain items, and the\r\nmodification or cessation of current campaigns. The directives were\r\nissued to the representatives of the press in person or sent through the\r\nfacilities of the DNB to the local papers. (_2434-PS_; _2529-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Home Press Department of the Propaganda Ministry had an important\r\nparticipation in administering the provisions of the Editorial Control\r\nLaw, which made the profession of editor “a public task, which is\r\nregulated as to its professional duties and rights by the state.” That\r\nlaw also included requirements for admission to the profession and other\r\nelaborate controls. (_2083-PS_)\r\n\r\n(9) _Periodical Literature._ This department supervised German\r\nperiodical literature in the same manner as the _Abteilung Deutsche\r\nPresse_ controlled the daily press.\r\n\r\nOther divisions exercised supervision over the Theatre (selection and\r\nsupervision of the entire dramatic production and influencing the\r\nprograms of all German Theatres); the Arts; Music (“the entire cultural\r\nand political leadership of German musical life”); Special Cultural\r\nTasks (“This department serves mainly to eliminate all Jews from German\r\nCultural life”); and Foreign Tourists. (_2434-PS_)\r\n\r\nA large organization of faithful Party followers was recruited to\r\ndischarge the manifold functions of the Propaganda Ministry. The staff\r\nnumbered 1000 persons in 1939-1940. In the words of Mueller:\r\n\r\n    “It is no accident; therefore, that the great majority of the\r\n    official workers and other personnel of the Ministry consist of\r\n    reliable National Socialists of which almost 100 are bearers of\r\n    the Gold Party Pin.” (_2434-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _The semi-autonomous professional organizations Reichskulturkammer_\r\n(Reich Chamber of Culture).\r\n\r\nThe Reich Chamber of Culture was set up in September 1933 to control\r\n(under the supervision of the Propaganda Ministry and within the\r\nframework of general policy directives issued by that activity)\r\npersonnel engaged in all fields of propaganda (_2082-PS_). Its tasks as\r\ndescribed in the First Executive Decree of the above law, dated 1\r\nNovember 1933, were:\r\n\r\n    “To promote German culture as responsible to the people and the\r\n    Reich, to regulate the social and economic relations of the\r\n    different groups in the cultural professions and to coordinate\r\n    their aims.” (_2415-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe _Reichskulturkammer_ was a so-called “_Nachgeordnete Dienststelle_”\r\n(Subordinate office) of the Propaganda Ministry. Together with its\r\nsubordinate Chambers it was charged with supervising all personnel\r\nactive in any field under the jurisdiction of the Propaganda Ministry.\r\nAll persons employed in the cultural professions were obligated to\r\nregister with one of the subordinate Chambers. The Chambers were also\r\nresponsible for investigating the activities and political reliability\r\nof their members. Moreover, power was given to Chambers to prosecute\r\nmembers offending against Nazi standards or persons pursuing their\r\noccupation without being duly registered. The punitive powers included,\r\nexpulsion from membership, which was tantamount to the loss of\r\nlivelihood. The Chambers were also given power to issue directives,\r\nwhich had the validity of law, regulating the cultural activities under\r\ntheir control (_2529-PS_). The President of the Chamber of Culture was\r\nthe Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, who nominated the\r\nVice-Presidents. In 1937, the latter consisted of Walter Funk, Max Amann\r\n(Reich Leader of the Press) and Leopold Gutterer (Secretary of State in\r\nthe Propaganda Ministry).\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Culture was divided into seven functional chambers:\r\n\r\n(1) _Reichspressekammer_ (Reich Press Chamber). Max Amann was president\r\nof this chamber, which was, to a greater extent than the other chambers,\r\na loose association of technical bodies and organizations, such as the\r\nReich Association of German Newspaper Publishers. It integrated the\r\nactivities of these groups and, through the composition of its governing\r\nbody, ensured close coordination with Party and State propaganda\r\nmachinery. (_2529-PS_; _3016-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Reichskammer der bildenden Kunste_ (Reich Chamber of Fine Arts).\r\nThis chamber supervised the activities of all architects, interior\r\ndecorators, landscape gardeners, sculptors, painters, draftsmen, art\r\npublishers, etc. By 1937, all other art groups and associations had been\r\ndissolved, and all their members “obligated by profession” to join this\r\nchamber. (_2529-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Reichsmusikkammer_ (Reich Music Chamber). This Chamber was\r\norganized to “oversee the practice and activity of musicians in their\r\ncultural, economic, and legal relationships with the world. * * * in\r\norder that music will still remain a prized possession of the German\r\npeople.” (_2529-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Reichstheaterkammer_ (Reich Theater Chamber). The Theater Chamber\r\nwas the professional organization for the entire field of the\r\nprofessional theater. Its purpose was to supervise and promote the\r\n“cultural, social and economic conditions of the professions which it\r\nincludes”. Actual censorship of stage production was the responsibility\r\nof the _Reichsdramaturg_. (_2529-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Reichsfilmkammer_ (Reich Film Chamber). The primary function of\r\nthis Chamber was to lift the film industry “out of the sphere of liberal\r\neconomic thoughts” by giving it a sound economic foundation and thus\r\nenable it to “receive those tasks which it has to fulfill in the\r\nNational Socialist State”. (_2529-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _Reichsschrifttumskammer_ (Reich Chamber of Literature). The Chamber\r\nof Literature had jurisdiction over all persons concerned with the\r\n“basic production” (writing and publishing) of literature. Its task was\r\nto protect writers “from undesirable elements” and to keep out of the\r\nbook market everything “unGerman.” It had the further function of\r\nbringing literature to the people and making the writer more “aware of\r\nhis duty to the nation.” Primary responsibility for critical evaluation\r\nand censorship of literature however, was left to the Propaganda\r\nMinistry. (_2529-PS_)\r\n\r\n(7) _Reichsrundfunkkammer_ (Reich Radio Chamber). The official gazette\r\nof the Reich Culture Chamber stated that the radio was the most\r\nimmediate propaganda instrument of the National Socialist leadership;\r\nthat the ideal and cultural life of the nation could be shown “totally”\r\nin and through the radio; and that since the radio constituted the most\r\nimportant technical means of influencing the masses it was necessary to\r\nestablish a close tie between the radio and the Party.\r\n\r\nFunctions of the Radio Chamber included: mobilizing of all technical\r\npossibilities of broadcasting, bringing the people closer to radio,\r\nplanning the manufacture of cheap receiving sets, and propaganda in\r\nconnection with the drive for new listeners.

MILITARIZATION OF NAZI ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nA. _The Nazi conspirators placed many of their organizations on a\r\nprogressively militarized footing with a view to the rapid\r\ntransformation and use of such organizations as instruments of war._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Schutzstaffeln (SS)._ The SS was militarized beginning in March\r\n1933, when special, volunteer, armed units were created consisting of\r\nfull-time garrisoned troops. These units, which rapidly grew in\r\nstrength, were a part neither of the Wehrmacht, nor of the police, but\r\nwere exclusively at the disposal of the Fuehrer. This militarization of\r\nthe SS was in accordance with Nazi policy. (For documentation and\r\nfurther discussion see Chapter XV, Section 5.)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Sturmabteilung (SA)._ The SA was founded in 1921 as a\r\npara-military organization to fight political enemies of the Nazis.\r\nAfter the accession of the Nazis to power, the SA was used to provide\r\npre-military training at a time when the Reichswehr was legally limited\r\nto a strength of 100,000 men. Thus the SA, from its inception, had a\r\nmilitary purpose, which was carried out and gradually increased in\r\nscope. (For documentation and further discussion see Chapter XV, Section\r\n4.)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Hitler Jugend (HJ)._ One of the chief purposes of the Hitler\r\nJugend was to provide for military training of German youth at a very\r\nearly age. As early as 1933, the HJ entered into a secret program of\r\nextensive pre-military training for German youth in conjunction with the\r\nSA and the Wehrmacht. In addition to general military training, members\r\nof the HJ were given specialized training in various types of military\r\nunits, such as flying units, naval units, motorized units, signal units,\r\netc. (For documentation and further discussion, see Section 8, _supra_.)\r\n\r\n(4) _The National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK)._ The original NSKK was\r\nfounded under the name of NSAK (National Socialist Automobile Corps) on\r\n1 April 1930 by Hitler, who joined as its first member. By the end of\r\n1931 it had a membership of approximately 10,000, as compared to 300 at\r\nthe beginning of that year (_2804-PS_). In 1934 the motorized Hitler\r\nJugend and the motorized SA were placed under the NSKK. Hitler, on 23\r\nAugust of that year, decreed that:\r\n\r\n    “the NSAK and the motorized SA are from now on welded together\r\n    into a unit called NSKK. The NSKK is directly subordinate to\r\n    me”. (_2804-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus the NSKK was elevated to the position of an independent affiliated\r\nunit of the NSDAP, similar to the SA and the SS. The membership of the\r\nenlarged NSKK grew rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe military purpose of the NSKK is evident from the following statement\r\nfrom The _Organizationbuch der NSDAP_ (1940):\r\n\r\n    “The young driver who has received his training in the six-week\r\n    courses of the NSKK will be well prepared in body and spirit\r\n    when the time comes for his military service, and will wear with\r\n    pride the dress of the Armed Forces of the Nation.”\r\n    (_2320-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe program of militarization proceeded rapidly:\r\n\r\n    “More than one-third of all leaders and men of the NSKK, which\r\n    had in the meantime grown to a membership of 350,000, were\r\n    already active in the fight for power * * * Thus, the NSKK had\r\n    in its ranks, in addition to the proud tradition of the period\r\n    of our fight, also that of the World War. This front spirit and\r\n    experience of a generation matured to manhood in the barrages,\r\n    in the battles of attrition, in the battles of the Freikorps,\r\n    and in the heroic fight of National Socialism for Germany’s\r\n    rebirth, is passed on to our youth as a sacred heritage.”\r\n    (_2804-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe training given to NSKK members was intended to furnish seasoned\r\nrecruits for the Nazi military forces.\r\n\r\n    “Military motorized training of our youth is the cardinal task\r\n    of the educational work of the NSKK. Here it collaborates most\r\n    closely with the bearer of the arms of the Reich, the Wehrmacht,\r\n    and it has done so already throughout the years before the\r\n    seizure of power. The demands and needs of the Army, which\r\n    continuously grew in scope after the awakening of our Nation and\r\n    after our regained military freedom also caused the tasks and\r\n    the work of the NSKK in the field of military motorized training\r\n    to grow correspondingly * * * By order of the Fuehrer and\r\n    Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht, the NSKK has been given\r\n    charge of the pre-military training of the entire young reserve\r\n    of the motorized troop units of our Army in addition to\r\n    post-military training.” (_2804-PS_)\r\n\r\nNSKK-trained men were intended to be assimilated into Reich Panzer\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n    “Well prepared physically and spiritually, the young German man\r\n    who has now become a motorized soldier, can serve with a\r\n    motorized or partially-motorized unit of the Army. To become a\r\n    tank soldier is his only ambition.” (_2804-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe NSKK was actually used for military purposes.\r\n\r\n    “The men of the NSKK have considerably contributed to the\r\n    liberation of the Sudetenland by the Fuehrer and have thus\r\n    gained undying merit, not only for the Germans in the\r\n    Sudetenland, but for the entire German people as a whole.”\r\n    (_2804-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of actual military use of the NSKK is given in the\r\nfollowing passage from “_Deutschland im Kampf_” written by\r\n_Ministerialdirigent_ A. J. Berndt of the Reich Propaganda Ministry and\r\nLt. Col. von Wedel of the German Army High Command, in the issue of June\r\n1940:\r\n\r\n    “The NSKK is playing a decisive part in the carrying out of\r\n    considerable war-important tasks on the Inner Front, one of\r\n    which is traffic. * * * Among the tasks of the NSKK are\r\n    pre-military training, education, and schooling and motorized\r\n    transport. Thus, for instance, the conducting of the entire\r\n    transport system of the TODT Organization on the West Wall and\r\n    the traffic in the Western War Theater are in the hands of the\r\n    NSKK.” (_2810-PS_)\r\n\r\n(5) _The National Socialist Aviation Corps (NSFK)._ The NSFK was another\r\norganization affiliated with the NSDAP used by the Nazi conspirators for\r\nmilitary purposes. It was the great training school for the Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\n    “In the endeavor to assure for the German Luftwaffe a\r\n    numerically strong and well prepared reserve, and to strengthen\r\n    in the German people the conviction that Germany must retain its\r\n    head-start in all spheres of aviation, the NSFK was founded by\r\n    the Fuehrer on 17 April 1937 * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The NSFK at the time of its creation, was given the following\r\n    tasks by the Reichsmarshal:\r\n\r\n    “1. Pre-military aviation training of the new blood for the\r\n    Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\n    “2. The keeping in training of the reservists of the aviation\r\n    troops.\r\n\r\n    “3. The combining and directing of all German air sports.\r\n\r\n    “4. Promotion and extension of the aviation idea among the\r\n    German people.\r\n\r\n    “These tasks are so great that the cooperation of tens of\r\n    thousands of active members is necessary to make carrying them\r\n    out possible, so that the Luftwaffe may be able at any time to\r\n    count on their fulfillment according to plan.” (_2811-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe paramount military purpose of the NSFK is clearly indicated in the\r\nfollowing admission by _Generalleutnant_ Friedrich Christiansen,\r\n_Korpsfuehrer_ of the NSFK:\r\n\r\n    “Schooled in character, trained physically as a flier, and as a\r\n    soldier, the member-to-be of the Luftwaffe leaves the NSFK.”\r\n    (_2813-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _The Reichsarbeitdienst (RAD)_ (The Reich Labor Service). The Reich\r\nLabor Service was also subverted to military purposes by the Nazi\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nMembership in the RAD was made compulsory for both young men and women\r\non 26 June 1935.\r\n\r\n    “All young Germans of either sex between 18-25 years of age are\r\n    obligated to serve their people in the Reich Labor Service. As\r\n    the schooling of the Nation, it has as its object this education\r\n    of the German Youth to National Socialist Ideology.\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Labor Service for men is, thanks to its military\r\n    nature, closely-knit units, and its particular education and\r\n    training an ever-ready, powerful tool of the National Socialist\r\n    Reich.” (_2805-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe tens of thousands of members of the RAD were militarily trained and\r\nready for action when Germany launched her campaigns of aggression.\r\nActual military use of the men of the RAD is clearly shown in the 1 June\r\n1943 edition of “_Fuehren und Erziehen_” (Leadership and Education), the\r\nofficial magazine of the Reich Labor Service. A photograph depicts a\r\nLabor Service man repairing a bridge at the front, across which four\r\ninfantrymen are proceeding, and is titled as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The young crews who have gone through the educational\r\n    institutions of the Reich Labor Service today represent the most\r\n    active nucleus of our Army. * * * Our photograph shows labor men\r\n    who in the East are preparing the way for infantry shock troops\r\n    by repairing a bridge. Thus also the men of the Reich Labor\r\n    Service are today one of the examples of eternal German\r\n    soldierdom.” (_2806-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe military uses of the RAD are further described in the following\r\nletter written by Goering to Reich Labor Service Leader Konstantin\r\nHierl:\r\n\r\n    “After the victorious termination of the campaign in Poland, I\r\n    cannot but convey to you my sincere thanks for and unreserved\r\n    recognition of the help rendered by the Reich Labor Service in\r\n    the carrying out of the operations of the Luftwaffe. In guarding\r\n    Army airfields, in clearing and quickly repairing former enemy\r\n    airports, in road construction and in bringing up supplies,\r\n    everywhere your men have done a real job and have thus\r\n    contributed considerably to the successes of the German\r\n    Luftwaffe.” (_2807-PS_)\r\n\r\n(7) _The TODT Organization (OT)._ The TODT Organization, or OT, was\r\nanother NSDAP affiliate used to further the militaristic aims of the\r\nNazi conspirators. The OT, originally an offshoot of the RAD, was\r\ncreated as a separate entity in June 1938 when Dr. Fritz Todt was\r\ncharged with the construction of the Siegfried Line or West Wall. The\r\nmilitary employment of the OT is clearly shown in the following passage\r\nfrom “_Maenner der OT_”, which was published by the Photographic Office\r\nof the Reich Propaganda Office:\r\n\r\n    “No sooner had the greatest and most modern fortifications of\r\n    the world, the West Wall, been completed by the workers of the\r\n    OT, when these very same workers were called upon by the Fuehrer\r\n    to prove their worth also in direct front service * * * and they\r\n    thus helped * * * to achieve the greatest victory in history.\r\n    When the great offensive in the west began, the brown workers’\r\n    columns of the TODT organization followed immediately behind\r\n    them. After the armistice with France had been signed, an\r\n    entirely new situation developed for the TODT organization. Its\r\n    columns had pushed deep into enemy country. Not seldom did they\r\n    have direct contact with the enemy—their losses in dead and\r\n    wounded and the Iron Cross awards are heroic proof of that.\r\n    While, as the foremost construction workers of the German Reich,\r\n    they had already proved their worth when building the West Wall,\r\n    they were now able to perfect what they had learned in the fight\r\n    against the British world enemy. From the Channel coast to the\r\n    Atlantic Ocean, the front technicians and front workers of the\r\n    OT now proceeded to create the prerequisites for a successful\r\n    fight against England.” (_2808-PS_)\r\n\r\nThough the OT was in its origin technically a civilian organization, it\r\nsubsequently became a para-military body which, before and during the\r\nwar, cooperated fully with the German Army. On 2 July 1940, a directive\r\nwas issued from the German High Command appointing a liaison officer.\r\n\r\n    “* * * to establish the closest liaison and cooperation of the\r\n    respective military offices with the main construction work of\r\n    the TODT Organization.” (_2812-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis militarization of the OT is further shown in the following passage\r\nfrom “_Nationalsozialistische Monatschefte_” for 1942:\r\n\r\n    “From the Autobahn workers was developed the ‘Organization TODT’\r\n    a body of hundreds of thousands of workers who help the\r\n    Wehrmacht everywhere in eliminating obstacles, building bridges\r\n    and erecting fortifications and shelters. The front soldier and\r\n    the front worker stand side by side. Together they have shed\r\n    their blood in this war and together they have won victories.\r\n    Long-range guns on the Channel coast, U-boat bases on the\r\n    Atlantic, and now the East will render the ‘OT’ immortal for all\r\n    times to come.” (_2809-PS_)\r\n\r\nA letter from Fritz Sauckel to Hitler, dated 17 May 1943, states that\r\nthe OT had supplied 248,200 workers by March 1943 for the completion of\r\nthe Atlantic Wall, and praises the OT for its excellent work in this\r\nregard. (_407-VIII-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy 1938, all phases of German life _had been_ mobilized for the\r\naccomplishment of militant aims.\r\n\r\nHitler declared to the Reichstag on 20 February 1938:\r\n\r\n    “Only now we have succeeded in setting before us the great tasks\r\n    and in possessing the material things which are the\r\n    prerequisites for the realization of great creative plans in all\r\n    fields of our national existence. Thus, National Socialism has\r\n    made up within a few years for what centuries before it had\r\n    omitted. * * *\r\n\r\n    “National Socialism has given the German people that leadership\r\n    which as party not only mobilizes the nation but also organizes\r\n    it, so that on the basis of the natural principle of selection,\r\n    the continuance of a stable political leadership is safeguarded\r\n    forever * * * National Socialism * * * possesses Germany\r\n    entirely and completely since the day when, five years ago, I\r\n    left the house in Wilhelmplatz as Reich Chancellor. There is no\r\n    institution in this state which is not National Socialist.

The purpose of that rearmament is revealed in the secret records\r\nof the plans and deliberations of the inner councils of the Nazis. These\r\nrecords show that the reorganization of the German government, the\r\nfinancial wizardry of Hjalmar Schacht, and the total mobilization of the\r\nGerman economy largely under Hjalmar Schacht, Hermann Goering, and\r\nWalter Funk, were directed at a single goal: aggressive war.\r\n\r\n                    I. ECONOMIC MOBILIZATION FOR WAR\r\n\r\nThe significance of the economic measures adopted and applied by the\r\nconspirators can be properly appraised only if they are placed in the\r\nlarger social and political context of Nazi Germany. These economic\r\nmeasures were adopted while the conspirators were directing their vast\r\npropaganda apparatus to the glorification of war. They were adopted\r\nwhile the conspirators were perverting physical training into training\r\nfor war. They were adopted while these conspirators were threatening to\r\nuse force and were planning to use force to achieve their material and\r\npolitical objects. In short, these measures constitute in the field of\r\neconomics and government administration the same preparation for\r\naggressive war which dominated every aspect of the Nazi state.\r\n\r\nIn 1939 and 1940, after the Nazi aggression upon Poland, Holland,\r\nBelgium, and France, it became clear to the world that the Nazi\r\nconspirators had created probably the greatest instrument of aggression\r\nin history. That machine was built up almost in its entirety in a period\r\nof less than one decade. In May of 1939 Major General George Thomas,\r\nformer Chief of the Military-Economic Staff in the Reich War Ministry,\r\nreported that the German Army had grown from seven Infantry divisions in\r\n1933 to thirty-nine Infantry divisions, among them four fully motorized\r\nand three mountain divisions; eighteen Corps Headquarters; five Panzer\r\ndivisions; twenty-two machine gun battalions. Moreover, General Thomas\r\nstated that the German Navy had greatly expanded by the launching, among\r\nother vessels, of two battleships of thirty-five thousand tons, four\r\nheavy cruisers of ten thousand tons, and other warships; further, that\r\nthe Luftwaffe had grown to a point where it had a strength of two\r\nhundred sixty thousand men, twenty-one squadrons, consisting of two\r\nhundred forty echelons, and thirty-three Anti-Aircraft Batteries.\r\n(_EC-28_) General Thomas further reported, in a lecture delivered on 24\r\nMay 1939 in the Nazi Foreign Office, that out of the few factories\r\npermitted by the Versailles Treaty there had arisen * * *\r\n\r\n    “The mightiest armament industry now existing in the world. It\r\n    has attained the performances which in part equal the German\r\n    wartime performances and in part even surpasses them. Germany’s\r\n    crude steel production is today the largest in the world after\r\n    the Americans. The aluminum production exceeds that of America\r\n    and of the other countries of the world very considerably. The\r\n    output of our rifle, machine gun, and artillery factories is at\r\n    present larger than that of any other state.” (_EC-28_)\r\n\r\nThese results—about which General Thomas spoke in his book entitled\r\n_Basic Facts for a History of German War and Armaments Economy_—were\r\nachieved only by making preparation for war the dominating objective of\r\nGerman economy. As General Thomas stated on page 479 of his book:\r\n\r\n    “History will know only a few examples of cases where a country\r\n    has directed, even in peace time, all its economic forces\r\n    deliberately and systematically towards the requirements of war,\r\n    as Germany was compelled to do in the period between the two\r\n    World Wars.” (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe task of mobilizing the German economy for aggressive war began\r\npromptly after the Nazi conspirators’ seizure of power. It was entrusted\r\nprincipally to Schacht, Goering, and Funk.\r\n\r\nSchacht was appointed President of the Reichsbank in March 1933, and\r\nMinister of Economics in August 1934. The world did not know, however,\r\nthat the responsibility for the execution of this program was entrusted\r\nto the office of the Four Year Plan under Goering (_EC-408_). Nor did\r\nthe world know that Schacht was designated Plenipotentiary for the War\r\nEconomy on 21 May 1935, with complete control over the German civilian\r\neconomy for war production in the Reich Defense Council, established by\r\na top secret Hitler decree.\r\n\r\nA letter dated 24 June 1935, at Berlin, and signed by von Blomberg,\r\nreads in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor has nominated the\r\n    President of the directorate of the Reichsbank, Dr. Schacht, to\r\n    be Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy. * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * I point out the necessity of strictest secrecy once more\r\n    * * *.” (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nThrough Schacht’s financial genius monetary measures were devised to\r\nrestore German industry to full production; and through the control of\r\nimports and exports, which he devised under his new plan of 1934, German\r\nproduction was channeled in accordance with the requirements of the\r\nGerman war machine.\r\n\r\nIn 1936, with an eye to the experience in the First World War, the Nazi\r\nconspirators embarked on an ambitious plan to make Germany completely\r\nself-sufficient in strategic war materials such as rubber, gasoline, and\r\nsteel, in a period of four years, so that Germany would be fully\r\nprepared for aggressive war. The responsibility for the execution of\r\nthis program was entrusted to the office of the Four Year Plan under\r\nGoering. A “memorandum on the Four Year Plan and Preparation of the War\r\nEconomy,” dated 30 December 1936, and marked “Secret Command Matter”,\r\nsets out that the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor has conferred powers in\r\nregard to mobilization preparations in the economic field that need\r\nfurther definition. The third paragraph refers specifically to\r\nMinister-President, Generaloberst Goering as Commissioner of the Four\r\nYear Plan, by authority of the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor granted 18\r\nOctober 1936. The existence of this program involved the reorganization\r\nand control of the whole German economy for war. (_EC-408_)\r\n\r\nThe military objectives of the German economy were clearly stated by\r\nGeneral Thomas in a lecture on 28 February 1939, delivered at the Staff\r\nInstructor’s course. He stated:\r\n\r\n    “The National Socialist State, soon after taking over the power,\r\n    has reorganized the German economy in all sections and directed\r\n    it towards a military viewpoint, which had been requested by the\r\n    Army for years. Due to the reorganization, agriculture, commerce\r\n    and professions became those powerful instruments the Fuehrer\r\n    needs for his extensive plans, and we can say today that\r\n    Hitler’s mobile politics, as well as the powerful efforts of the\r\n    Army and economy, would not have been possible without the\r\n    necessary reorganization by the National Socialist Government.\r\n    We can now say that the economic organization as a whole\r\n    corresponds with the needs, although slight adjustments will\r\n    have to be made yet. Those reorganizations made a new system of\r\n    economics possible which was necessary in view of our internal\r\n    and foreign political situation as well as our financial\r\n    problems. The directed economy, as we have it today, concerning\r\n    agriculture, commerce and industry, is not only the expression\r\n    of the present State principles, but at the same time also the\r\n    economy of the country’s defense.” (_EC-27_)\r\n\r\nThis program was not undertaken in a vacuum; it was deliberately\r\ndesigned and executed to provide the necessary instrument of the Nazi\r\nconspirators’ plans for aggressive war. In September 1934 Schacht\r\nadmitted to the American Ambassador in Berlin that the Hitler Party was\r\nabsolutely committed to war, and that the people too were ready and\r\nwilling. (_EC-461_) At the same time Schacht promulgated his new plan\r\nfor the control of imports and exports in the interest of rearmament. A\r\nyear later he was appointed Plenipotentiary for War Economy by top\r\nsecret decree. (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 4 September 1936 Goering announced, at a Cabinet meeting attended by\r\nvon Blomberg, Schacht, and others, that Hitler had issued instructions\r\nto the Reich War Minister on the basis that “the show-down with Russia\r\nis inevitable,” and added that “all measures have to be taken just as if\r\nwe were actually in the stage of imminent danger of war.” (_EC-416_)\r\n\r\nIn the same month the office of the Four Year Plan was created with the\r\nmission of making Germany self-sufficient for war in four years. Goering\r\nregarded it as his task, within four years, to put the entire economy in\r\na state of readiness for war. (_EC-408_)\r\n\r\n          2. COLLABORATION OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN REARMAMENT\r\n\r\nAlthough the Nazi government officials provided the leadership in\r\npreparing Germany for war, they received also the enthusiastic and\r\ninvaluable cooperation of the German industrialists.\r\n\r\nOn the invitation of Goering, approximately 25 of the leading\r\nindustrialists of Germany, together with Schacht, attended a meeting in\r\nBerlin on 20 February 1933. This was shortly before the German election\r\nof 5 March 1933. At this meeting Hitler announced the conspirators’ aim\r\nto seize totalitarian control over Germany, to destroy the parliamentary\r\nsystem, to crush all opposition by force, and to restore the power of\r\nthe _Wehrmacht_. Among those present at that meeting were Gustav Krupp,\r\nhead of the munitions firm, Alfried Krupp, A.G.; four leading officials\r\nof the I. G. Farben Works, one of the world’s largest chemical concerns;\r\nAlbert Vogler, head of United Steel Works of Germany; and other leading\r\nindustrialists. This meeting is described in the following affidavit of\r\nGeorge von Schnitzler:\r\n\r\n    “I, George von Schnitzler, a member of the Vorstand of I. G.\r\n    Farben, make the following deposition under oath:\r\n\r\n    “At the end of February 1933, four members of the Vorstand of I.\r\n    G. Farben, including Dr. Bosch, the head of the Vorstand, and\r\n    myself were asked by the office of the President of the\r\n    Reichstag to attend a meeting in his house, the purpose of which\r\n    was not given. I do not remember the two other colleagues of\r\n    mine who were also invited. I believe the invitation reached me\r\n    during one of my business trips to Berlin. I went to the meeting\r\n    which was attended by about 20 persons, who I believe were\r\n    mostly leading industrialists from the Ruhr.\r\n\r\n    “Among those present I remember:\r\n\r\n    “Dr. Schacht, who at that time was not yet head of the\r\n    _Reichsbank_ again and not yet Minister of Economics.\r\n\r\n    “Krupp von Bohlen, who in the beginning of 1933 presided over\r\n    the _Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie_, which later on was\r\n    changed into the semi-official organization ‘_Reichsgruppe\r\n    Industrie_.’\r\n\r\n    “Dr. Albert Vogler, the leading man of the _Vereinigte\r\n    Stahlwerke_.\r\n\r\n    “Von Lowenfeld from an industrial work in Essen.\r\n\r\n    “Dr. Stein, head of the _Gewerkschaft Auguste Victoria_, a mine\r\n    which belongs to the I. G. Dr. Stein was an active member of the\r\n    _Deutsche Volkspartei_.\r\n\r\n    “I remember that Dr. Schacht acted as a kind of host.\r\n\r\n    “While I had expected the appearance of Goering, Hitler entered\r\n    the room, shook hands with everybody and took a seat at the top\r\n    of the table. In a long speech, he talked mainly about the\r\n    danger of communism over which he pretended that he just had won\r\n    a decisive victory.\r\n\r\n    “He then talked about the _Bundnis_—alliance—into which his\r\n    party and the _Deutsch Nationale Volkspartei_ had entered. This\r\n    latter party, in the meantime, had been reorganized by Herr von\r\n    Papen. At the end he came to the point which seemed to me the\r\n    purpose of the meeting. Hitler stressed the importance that the\r\n    two aforementioned parties should gain the majority in the\r\n    coming Reichstag election. Krupp von Bohlen thanked Hitler for\r\n    his speech. After Hitler had left the room, Dr. Schacht proposed\r\n    to the meeting the raising of an election fund of, as far as I\r\n    remember, RM 3,000,000. The fund should be distributed between\r\n    the two ‘allies’ according to their relative strength at the\r\n    time being. Dr. Stein suggested that the _Deutsche Volkspartei_\r\n    should be included * * *.” (_EC-439_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered to the industrialists in Berlin on 20 February\r\n1933, Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “Private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of\r\n    democracy; it is conceivable only if the people have a sound\r\n    idea of authority and personality. * * * I recognized even while\r\n    in the hospital that one had to search for new ideas conducive\r\n    to reconstruction. I found them in Nationalism, in the value of\r\n    strength and power of individual personality. * * * If one\r\n    rejects pacifism, one must put a new idea in its place\r\n    immediately. Everything must be pushed aside, must be replaced\r\n    by something better. * * * We must not forget that all the\r\n    benefits of culture must be introduced more or less with an iron\r\n    fist just as once upon a time the farmers were forced to plant\r\n    potatoes.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “With the very same courage with which we go to work to make up\r\n    for what had been sinned during the last 14 years, we have\r\n    withstood all attempts to move us off the right way.”\r\n\r\n    “* * * We must first gain complete power if we want to crush the\r\n    other side completely. While still gaining power, one should not\r\n    start the struggle against the opponent. Only when one knows\r\n    that one has reached the pinnacle of power, that there is no\r\n    further possible development, shall one strike. * * *\r\n\r\n    “* * * Now we stand before the last election. Regardless of the\r\n    outcome there will be no retreat, even if the coming election\r\n    does not bring about a decision. * * *\r\n\r\n    “The question of restoration of the _Wehrmacht_ will not be\r\n    decided at Geneva but in Germany, when we have gained internal\r\n    strength through internal peace.” (_D-203_)\r\n\r\nIn reply to these statements Goering, who was present at that same\r\nmeeting, declared:\r\n\r\n    “That the sacrifice asked for surely would be much easier for\r\n    industry to bear if it realized that the election of March 5th\r\n    will surely be the last one for the next ten years, probably\r\n    even for the next hundred years.” (_D-203_)\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum dated 22 February 1933, found in the personal files of\r\nGustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, Krupp briefly described this same\r\nmeeting, and recalled that he had expressed to Hitler the gratitude of\r\nthe 25 industrialists present. (_D-204_)\r\n\r\nIn April 1933, after Hitler had entrenched himself in power, Gustav\r\nKrupp, as Chairman of the Reich Association of German Industry, which\r\nwas the largest association of German industrialists, submitted to\r\nHitler the plan of that association for the reorganization of German\r\nindustry. In connection therewith Krupp undertook to bring the\r\nassociation into line with the aims of the conspirators, and to make it\r\nan effective instrument for the execution of their policies. In a letter\r\nof transmittal (_D-157_), Krupp stated that the plan of reorganization\r\nwhich he submitted on behalf of the association of industrialists, was\r\ncharacterized by the desire to coordinate economic measures and\r\npolitical necessity, adopting the Fuehrer conception of the new German\r\nstate. In the plan of reorganization itself, Krupp stated:\r\n\r\n    “The turn of political events is in line with the wishes which I\r\n    myself and the board of directors have cherished for a long\r\n    time. In reorganizing the Reich Association of German Industry,\r\n    I shall be guided by the idea of bringing the new organization\r\n    into agreement with the political aims of the Reich Government.”\r\n    (_D-157_)\r\n\r\nThe ideas of Krupp were subsequently adopted.\r\n\r\nUnder the decree introducing the leadership principle into industry,\r\neach group of industry was required to have a leader who was to serve\r\nwithout compensation. The leaders were to be appointed and could be\r\nremoved at the discretion of the Minister of Economics. The charter of\r\neach group was to be created by the leader, who was obligated to lead\r\nhis group in accordance with the principles of the National Socialist\r\nState (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1934, Part I, 1194, Sec. 11, 12, 16). The\r\nintroduction of the leadership principle into the organizations of\r\nbusiness centralized authority and guaranteed the efficient execution of\r\norders, which the government issued to business, in the effort to\r\npromote a war economy.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming support given by the German industrialists to the Nazi\r\nwar program is described in a speech prepared by Gustav Krupp in January\r\n1944, for delivery at the University of Berlin:\r\n\r\n    “War material is life-saving for one’s own people, and whoever\r\n    works and performs in those spheres can be proud of it. Here,\r\n    enterprise as a whole, finds its highest justification of\r\n    existence. This justification, I may inject this here,\r\n    crystallized especially during the time of interregnum between\r\n    1919 and 1933, when Germany was lying down disarmed. * * *\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It is the one great merit of the entire German war economy that\r\n    it did not remain idle during those bad years, even though its\r\n    activity could not be brought to light for obvious reasons.\r\n    Through years of secret work, scientific and basic groundwork\r\n    was laid in order to be ready again to work for the German armed\r\n    forces at the appointed hour without loss of time or experience.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Only through the secret activity of German enterprise, together\r\n    with the experience gained meanwhile through production of\r\n    peacetime goods, was it possible, after 1933, to fall into step\r\n    with the new tasks arrived at, restoring Germany’s military\r\n    power. Only through all that could the entirely new and various\r\n    problems, brought up by the Fuehrer’s Four-Year Plan for German\r\n    enterprise, be mastered. It was necessary to supply the new raw\r\n    materials, to explore and experiment, to invest capital in order\r\n    to make German economy independent and strong—in short, to make\r\n    it war-worthy.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I think I may state here that the German enterprises followed\r\n    the new ways enthusiastically, that they made the great\r\n    intentions of the Fuehrer their own by fair competition and\r\n    conscious gratitude, and became his faithful followers. How else\r\n    could the tasks between 1933 and 1939, and especially those\r\n    after 1939, have been overcome?” (_D-317_)\r\n\r\n        3. THE USE OF ECONOMIC MEASURES TO FACILITATE REARMAMENT\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasized that the secret rearmament program was launched\r\nimmediately upon the seizure of power by the Nazi conspirators. On 4\r\nApril 1933 the Reich Cabinet passed a resolution establishing a Reich\r\nDefense Council. The function of this council was secretly to mobilize\r\nfor war. At the second meeting of the working committee of the\r\nCouncillors for Reich Defense, the predecessor of the Reich Defense\r\nCouncil, which was held on 22 May 1933, the chairman was Keitel. Keitel\r\nstated that the Reich Defense Council would immediately undertake to\r\nprepare for war emergency. He stressed the urgency of the task of\r\norganizing a war economy, and announced that the council stood ready to\r\nbrush aside all obstacles. Fully aware of the fact that their action was\r\nin flagrant violation of the Treaty of Versailles, Keitel emphasized the\r\nextreme importance of absolute secrecy:\r\n\r\n    “No document ought to be lost, since otherwise it may fall into\r\n    the hands of the enemies’ intelligence service. Orally\r\n    transmitted, matters are not provable; they can be denied by us\r\n    in Geneva.” (_EC-177_)\r\n\r\nThe singleness of purpose with which the Nazi conspirators geared the\r\nGerman economy to the forging of a war machine is further shown by the\r\nsecret minutes of the second meeting of the working committee of the\r\nReich Defense Council, held on 7 February 1934. At this meeting at which\r\nCapt. Schmundt, Col. Guerian, Maj. Gen. von Reichenau, Maj. Warlimont,\r\nand Jodl—then a Lt. Col.—were present, Lieutenant-General Beck pointed\r\nout that:\r\n\r\n    “The actual state of preparation is the purpose of this\r\n    session.” (_EC-404_)\r\n\r\nDetailed measures of financing a future war were discussed and it was\r\npointed out that the financial aspects of the war economy would be\r\nregulated by the Reich Finance Ministry and the Reichsbank, which was\r\nheaded by Schacht. (_EC-404_)\r\n\r\nUnder his secret appointment as Plenipotentiary-General of the War\r\nEconomy, Schacht had the express function of placing all economic forces\r\nof the nation in the services of the Nazi war machine. The secret\r\ndefense law of 21 May 1935 in effect gave Schacht charge of the entire\r\nwar economy. In case of war he was to be virtual economic dictator of\r\nGermany. His task was to place all economic forces into service for the\r\nconduct of war and to secure economically the life of the German people.\r\nThe Ministers of Economics, Food, Agriculture, Labor, and Forestry, as\r\nwell as all Reich agencies directly under the Fuehrer, were subordinated\r\nto him. He was to be responsible for the financing as well as for the\r\nconduct of the war; and he was further authorized to issue ordinances\r\nwithin his sphere of responsibility, even if these deviated from\r\nexisting laws. (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe rearmament of Germany proceeded at a rapid pace. By summer of 1935\r\nthe Nazi conspirators were emboldened to make plans for the reoccupation\r\nof the Rhineland, and at the tenth meeting of the working committee of\r\nthe council the question of measures to be taken in connection with the\r\nproposed reoccupation of the Rhineland was discussed.\r\n\r\nAt that meeting, on 26 June 1935, it was said that the Rhineland\r\nrequired special treatment because of the assurances given by Hitler to\r\nthe French that no military action was being undertaken in the\r\ndemilitarized zone. Among the matters requiring special treatment was\r\nthe preparation of economic mobilization, a task specifically entrusted\r\nto Schacht as secret Plenipotentiary for the War Economy. In this\r\nconnection it was stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Since political entanglements abroad must be avoided at\r\n    present under all circumstances, only these preparatory measures\r\n    that are urgently necessary may be carried out. The existence of\r\n    such preparations, or the intention of them must be kept in\r\n    strictest secrecy in the zone itself as well as in the rest of\r\n    the Reich.” (_EC-405_)\r\n\r\nPreparations of various types were thereupon discussed.\r\n\r\nThe rapid success of German rearmament is attributable to the work of\r\nSchacht. In the fall of 1934, the Nazi conspirators announced the “New\r\nPlan”, which aimed at the control of imports and exports in order to\r\nobtain the raw materials needed for armaments and the foreign currency\r\nrequired to sustain the armament program. The “New Plan” was the\r\ncreation of Schacht. Under the plan, Schacht controlled imports by\r\nextending the system of supervisory boards for import control, which was\r\npreviously limited to the main groups of raw materials, to all goods\r\nimported into Germany. The requirement of licenses for imports enabled\r\nthe Nazi conspirators to restrict imports to those commodities which\r\nserved their war aims.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in February 1935, the _Devisen_ Law was passed\r\n(_Reichsgesetzblatt_ 1935, I, 105). Under it, all transactions involving\r\nforeign exchange were subject to the approval of _Devisenstellen_\r\n(Foreign Exchange Control Offices). By thus controlling the disposition\r\nof foreign exchange, the conspirators were able to manipulate foreign\r\ntrade so as to serve their ends.\r\n\r\nEvery aspect of the German economy was geared to war under the guidance\r\nof the Nazi conspirators, particularly Schacht. In a study of the\r\neconomic mobilization for war as of 30 September 1934, it was stated\r\nthat steps had already been taken to build up stock piles, to construct\r\nnew facilities for the production of scarce goods, to redeploy industry\r\nto secure areas, and to control fiscal and trade policies. The task of\r\nstock piling, it was announced, had been hampered by the requirement of\r\nsecrecy and camouflage. Reserves of automobile fuels and stocks of coal\r\nwere accumulated, and the production of synthetic oil was accelerated.\r\nCivilian supply was purposely organized so that most plants would be\r\nworking for the German Armed Forces. Studies were made of the\r\npossibility of barter trade with supposedly neutral countries in case of\r\nwar. (_EC-128_)\r\n\r\nFinancing of the armament program presented a difficult problem for the\r\nconspirators. In 1934 and 1935, the German economy could by no\r\npossibility have raised funds for the Nazis’ extensive rearmament\r\nprogram through taxes and public loans. From the outset, the armament\r\nprogram involved “the engagement of the last reserves.” Moreover, apart\r\nfrom the problem of raising the huge sums required to sustain this\r\nprogram, the Nazi conspirators were exceedingly anxious, in the early\r\nstages, to conceal the extent of their armament activities.\r\n\r\nAfter considering various techniques of financing the armament program,\r\nSchacht proposed the use of “mefo” bills. One of the primary advantages\r\nof this method was the fact that through its use figures indicating the\r\nextent of rearmament, which would have become public through the use of\r\nother methods, could be kept secret. “Mefo” bills were used exclusively\r\nfor armament financing. Transactions in “mefo” bills worked as follows:\r\n“Mefo” bills were drawn by armament contractors and accepted by a\r\nlimited liability company. The spelling of the word “mefo” is taken from\r\nthe name of this company, _Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft,\r\nm.b.h._ (_MEFO_). This company had a nominal capital of one million\r\nReichsmarks and was merely a dummy organization. The bills were received\r\nby all German banks for possible rediscounting with the Reichsbank. The\r\nbills were guaranteed by the Reich. Their secrecy was assured by the\r\nfact that they appeared neither in the published statements of the\r\nReichsbank nor in the budget figures.\r\n\r\nThe “mefo” bill system continued to be used until 1 April 1938. Up to\r\nthat date 12 billion Reichsmarks of “mefo” bills for the financing of\r\nrearmament had been issued. Since it was no longer deemed necessary to\r\nconceal the vast progress of German rearmament, “mefo” financing was\r\ndiscontinued at that time. (_EC-436_)\r\n\r\nFurther sources of funds upon which Schacht drew to finance the secret\r\narmament program were the funds of political opponents of the Nazi\r\nregime, and Marks of foreigners on deposit in the Reichsbank. As Schacht\r\nboasted in a memorandum to Hitler dated 3 May 1935:\r\n\r\n    “Our armaments are also financed partly with the credits of our\r\n    political opponents.” (_1168-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe outstanding “mefo” bills represented at all times a threat to the\r\nstability of the currency because they could be tendered to the\r\nReichsbank for discount, in which case the currency circulation would\r\nautomatically have to be increased. Thus, there was an ever-present\r\nthreat of inflation. Schacht nevertheless continued on his course,\r\nbecause he stood with unswerving loyalty to the Fuehrer, because he\r\nfully recognized the basic idea of National Socialism, and because he\r\nfelt that at the end, the disturbances, compared to the great task,\r\ncould be considered irrelevant.\r\n\r\nHigh-ranking military officers paid tribute to Schacht’s contrivances on\r\nbehalf of the Nazi war machine. An article written for the “Military\r\nWeekly Gazette” in January 1937 stated:\r\n\r\n    “The German Defense Force commemorates Dr. Schacht today as one\r\n    of the men who have done imperishable things for it and its\r\n    development in accordance with directions from the Fuehrer and\r\n    Reich Chancellor. The defense force owes it to Schacht’s skill\r\n    and great ability that, in defiance of all currency difficulties\r\n    it, according to plan, has been able to grow up to its present\r\n    strength from an army of 100,000 men.”\r\n\r\nAfter the reoccupation of the Rhineland, the Nazi conspirators redoubled\r\ntheir efforts to prepare Germany for a major war. The Four Year Plan was\r\nproclaimed by Hitler in his address at the Nurnberg Party Convention on\r\n9 September 1936. It was given a statutory foundation by the decree\r\nconcerning the execution of the Four Year Plan dated 18 October 1936\r\n(_Reichsgesetzblatt_ 1936, I, 887). By this decree Goering was put in\r\ncharge of the plan. He was authorized to enact any legal and\r\nadministrative measures deemed necessary by him for the accomplishment\r\nof his task, and to issue orders and instructions to all government\r\nagencies, including the highest Reich authorities. The purpose of the\r\nplan was to enable Nazi Germany to attain complete self-sufficiency in\r\nessential raw materials, notably motor fuel, rubber, textile fiber, and\r\nnon-ferrous metals, and to intensify preparations for war. The\r\ndevelopment of synthetic products was greatly accelerated despite their\r\nhigh costs.\r\n\r\nApart from the self-sufficiency program, however, the Nazi conspirators\r\nrequired foreign exchange to finance propaganda and espionage activities\r\nabroad. Thus, in a speech on 1 November 1937 before the\r\n_Wehrmachtakademie_, General Thomas stated:\r\n\r\n    “If you consider that one will need during the war considerable\r\n    means in order to organize the necessary propaganda, in order to\r\n    pay for the espionage service, and for similar purposes, then\r\n    one should be clear that our internal Mark would be of no use\r\n    therefore, and that Foreign Exchange will be needed.” (_EC-14_)\r\n\r\nThis need for foreign exchange was reduced in part by virtue of the\r\nespionage and propaganda services rendered free of charge to the Nazi\r\nstate by leading German industrial concerns. A memorandum dated at Essen\r\non 12 October 1935, which was found in the files of the Krupp company,\r\ncontains the subheading: “Concerns:—distribution official propaganda\r\nliterature abroad with help of our foreign connections.” It goes on to\r\nsay that on the morning of 11 October the district representative of the\r\nRibbentrop Private Foreign Office, _Dienststelle Ribbentrop_, made an\r\nappointment by telephone with Mr. Lachman to arrive at an appointed\r\ntime. The memorandum continues:\r\n\r\n    “In answer to my question, with whom I was dealing and which\r\n    official bureau he represented, he informed me that he was not\r\n    himself the district representative of Ribbentrop’s Private\r\n    Foreign Office, but that a Mr. Landrat Bollman was such and that\r\n    he himself had come at Mr. Bollman’s order.” (_D-206_)\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the confusion in the field of foreign propaganda, the\r\nmemorandum states that Ribbentrop’s Foreign Office is creating a private\r\norganization for foreign propaganda, and that for this purpose the\r\nsupport of the Krupp firm and especially an index of addresses are\r\nneeded. This request received the following response:\r\n\r\n    “I informed Mr. Lachman that our firm has put itself years ago\r\n    at the disposal of official bureaus for purposes of foreign\r\n    propaganda, and that we had supported all requests addressed to\r\n    us to the utmost.” (_D-206_)\r\n\r\nThese activities are demonstrated by another document found in the files\r\nof the Krupp company. A memorandum prefaced by Herr Sonnenberg, on 14\r\nOctober 1937, reports a meeting at Essen on 12 October 1937. The\r\ngovernment’s request for assistance in foreign intelligence activities\r\nmet this response:\r\n\r\n    “On our part we undertook to supply information to the Combined\r\n    Services Ministry (R.K.M.) as required.” (_D-167_)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the conspirators’ program of self-sufficiency was proceeding\r\nwith great speed. The production of steel, for example, as shown in\r\nofficial German publication, rose as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                 _Tons_\r\n                1933                               74,000\r\n                1934                              105,000\r\n                1935                              145,000\r\n                1936                              186,000\r\n                1937                              217,000\r\n                1938                              477,000\r\n\r\nThe production of gasoline increased at an even greater tempo: from\r\n387,000 tons in 1934 to 1,494,000 tons in 1938 (_Statistical Yearbook of\r\nthe German Reich, 1939-1942_).\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators pressed the completion of the armament program\r\nwith a sense of urgency betraying their awareness of the imminence of\r\nwar. At a meeting on 4 September 1936 Goering pointed out that “all\r\nmeasures have to be taken just as if we were actually in the state of\r\nimminent danger of war.” He pointed out that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * if war should break out tomorrow we would be forced to\r\n    take measures from which we might possibly still shy away at the\r\n    present moment. They are therefore to be taken.” (_EC-416_)\r\n\r\nThe extreme urgency was manifested by Goering’s remark that\r\n\r\n    “* * * existent reserves will have to be touched for the purpose\r\n    of carrying us over this difficulty until the goal ordered by\r\n    the Fuehrer has been reached; in case of war they are not a\r\n    reliable backing in any case.” (_EC-416_)\r\n\r\nSchacht was advised by a top secret letter dated 31 August 1936 that\r\nHitler ordered all formations of the air force to be ready by 1 April\r\n1937. (_1301-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter their successes in Austria and the Sudetenland, the Nazi\r\nconspirators redoubled their efforts to equip themselves for the war of\r\naggression which they planned to launch. In a conference on 14 October\r\n1938, shortly before the Nazis made their first demands on Poland,\r\nGoering stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Everybody knows from the press what the world situation\r\n    looks like, and therefore the Fuehrer has issued an order to him\r\n    to carry out a gigantic program compared to which previous\r\n    achievements are insignificant. There are difficulties in the\r\n    way which he will overcome with the utmost energy and\r\n    ruthlessness.” (_1301-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe supply of foreign currency had sunken because of preparations for\r\nthe invasion of Czechoslovakia. Replenishment was considered necessary.\r\nAt the same conference, on 14 October 1938, Goering declared:\r\n\r\n    “These gains made through the export are to be used for an\r\n    increased armament. The armament should not be curtailed by\r\n    export activities.” (_1301-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering had received the order from the Fuehrer to increase armaments to\r\nan abnormal extent, the air force having first priority, and interpreted\r\nit as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Within the shortest time, the air force should be increased\r\n    five fold; also the navy should create war weapons more rapidly,\r\n    and the army should produce large amounts of war weapons at a\r\n    faster rate, particularly heavy artillery and heavy tanks. Along\r\n    with this a larger production of armaments must go, especially\r\n    fuel, rubber, powders and explosives must be moved to the\r\n    foreground. This should be coupled with an accelerated expansion\r\n    of highways, canals, and particularly of the railroads.”\r\n    (_1301-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the course of these preparations for war, a clash of wills ensued\r\nbetween Goering and Schacht, as a result of which Schacht resigned his\r\nposition as head of the Ministry of Economics and Plenipotentiary for\r\nthe War Economy in November 1937. He was removed from the presidency of\r\nthe Reichsbank in January 1939. Regardless of the details of this\r\ncontroversy, Schacht’s departure in no way implied any disagreement with\r\nthe major war aims of the Nazis. Schacht took particular pride in his\r\nvast attainments in the financial and economic fields in aid of the Nazi\r\nwar machine. In a letter to General Thomas Schacht wrote:\r\n\r\n    “I think back with much satisfaction to the work in the Ministry\r\n    of Economics which afforded me the opportunity to assist in the\r\n    rearmament of the German people in the most critical period, not\r\n    only in the financial but also in the economic sphere. I have\r\n    always considered a rearmament of the German people as condition\r\n    _sine qua non_ of the establishment of a new German nation.”\r\n    (_EC-257_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to General Von Blomberg, on 8 July 1937, Schacht\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    “The direction of the war economy by the plenipotentiary would\r\n    in that event never take place entirely independent from the\r\n    rest of the war mechanism but would be aimed at accomplishment\r\n    of the political war purpose with the assistance of all economic\r\n    forces. I am entirely willing, therefore, to participate in this\r\n    way in the preparation of the forthcoming order giving effect to\r\n    the Defense Act.” (_EC-252_)\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1937, Schacht participated with representatives of the\r\nthree branches of the armed forces in “war games in war economy” at\r\nGodesberg. A report of these exercises, entitled “War economy tasks in\r\nGodesberg undertaken by General Staff between the 25th of May and the\r\n2nd of June,” records the speech welcoming Dr. Schacht:\r\n\r\n    “Before I start with the discussion of the war game in war\r\n    economy, I have to express how grateful we all are that you,\r\n    President Dr. Schacht, have gone to the trouble personally to\r\n    participate in our final discussion today despite all your other\r\n    activities. This proves to us your deep interest in war economy\r\n    tasks shown at all times and your presence is renewed proof that\r\n    you are willing to facilitate for us soldiers the difficult\r\n    war-economic preparations and to strengthen the harmonious\r\n    cooperation with your offices.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I want to point out, however, that all matters and all\r\n    information received has to be kept in strictest secrecy * * *.”\r\n    (_EC-174_)\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Austria was apparently a goal which Schacht had long\r\nsought, for in a speech to the employees of the former Austrian National\r\nBank he declared:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Austria has certainly a great mission, namely, to be the\r\n    bearer of German culture, to insure respect and regard for the\r\n    German name, especially in the direction of the southeast. Such\r\n    a mission can only be performed within the Great German Reich\r\n    and based on the power of a nation of 75 millions, which,\r\n    regardless of the wish of the opponents, forms the heart and the\r\n    soul of Europe.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “We have read a lot in the foreign press during the last few\r\n    days that this aim, the union of both countries, is to a certain\r\n    degree justified, but that the methods of effecting this union\r\n    was terrible. This method which certainly did not suit one or\r\n    the other power was nothing but the consequence of countless\r\n    perfidies and brutal acts and violence which foreign countries\r\n    have practiced against us * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * I am known for sometimes expressing thoughts which give\r\n    offense and there I would not like to depart from this\r\n    consideration. I know that there are even in this country a few\r\n    people—I believe they are not too numerous—who find fault with\r\n    the events of the last few days, but nobody, I believe, doubts\r\n    the goal, and it should be said to all grumblers that you can’t\r\n    satisfy everybody. One person says he would have done it maybe\r\n    one way, but the remarkable thing is that they did not do it,\r\n    and that it was only done by our Adolf Hitler; and if there is\r\n    still something left to be improved, then those grumblers should\r\n    try to bring about these improvements from the German Reich, and\r\n    within the German community, but not to disturb us from\r\n    without.” (_EC-297-A_)\r\n\r\nA memorandum of 7 January 1939, written by Schacht and other directors\r\nof the Reichsbank to Hitler, urged a balancing of the budget in view of\r\nthe threatening danger of inflation. The memorandum continued:\r\n\r\n    “* * * From the beginning the Reichsbank has been aware of the\r\n    fact that a successful foreign policy can be attained only by\r\n    the reconstruction of the German armed forces. It [the\r\n    Reichsbank] therefore assumed to a very great extent the\r\n    responsibility to finance the rearmament in spite of the\r\n    inherent dangers to the currency. The justification thereof was\r\n    the necessity, which pushed all other considerations into the\r\n    background, to carry through the armament at once, out of\r\n    nothing, and furthermore under camouflage, which made a\r\n    respect-commanding foreign policy possible.” (_EC-369_)\r\n\r\nThe Reichsbank directors, as experts on money, believed that a point had\r\nbeen reached where greater production of armaments was no longer\r\npossible. That was merely a judgment on the situation and not a moral\r\nstand, for there was no opposition to Hitler’s policy of aggression.\r\nDoubts were merely entertained as to whether that policy could be\r\nfinanced. Hitler’s letter to Schacht on the occasion of Schacht’s\r\ndeparture from the Reichsbank paid high tribute to Schacht’s great\r\nefforts in furthering the program of the Nazi conspirators. The armed\r\nforces by now had enabled Hitler to take Austria and the Sudetenland.\r\nHitler, in his letter to Schacht declared:\r\n\r\n    “Your name, above all, will always be connected with the first\r\n    epoch of national rearmament.” (_EC-397_)\r\n\r\nEven though dismissed from the presidency of the Reichsbank, Schacht was\r\nretained as a minister without portfolio and special confidential\r\nadviser to Hitler. Funk stepped into Schacht’s position as president of\r\nthe Reichsbank (_Voelkisher Beobachter_ of 21 January 1939). Funk was\r\nuninhibited by fears of inflation, and like Goering, under whom he had\r\nserved in the Four Year Plan, he recognized no obstacles to the plan to\r\nattack Poland. In a letter written on 25 August 1939, only a few days\r\nbefore the attack on Poland, Funk reported to Hitler that the Reichsbank\r\nwas prepared to withstand any disturbances of the international currency\r\nand credit system occasioned by a large-scale war. He said that he had\r\nsecretly transferred all available funds of the Reichsbank abroad into\r\ngold, and that Germany stood ready to meet the financial and economic\r\ntasks which lay ahead. (_699-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that the Nazi conspirators directed the whole of the\r\nGerman economy toward preparation for aggressive war. To paraphrase the\r\nwords of Goering, the conspirators gave the German people “guns instead\r\nof butter.” They also gave history its most striking example of a nation\r\ngearing itself in time of peace to the single purpose of aggressive war.\r\nTheir economic preparations, formulated and applied with the energy of\r\nGoering, the financial wizardry of Schacht, and the willing complicity\r\nof Funk, among others, were the indispensable prerequisites for their\r\nsubsequent campaign of aggression.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF\r\n                             THE CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6, especially 6 (a).│  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (E).  │  I   │      21\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

THE PLOTTING OF AGGRESSIVE WAR\r\n\r\nThe aggressive war phase of the case against the Nazi conspirators is,\r\nin the view of the American prosecution, the heart of the case.\r\nEverything else in this case, however dramatic, however sordid, however\r\nshocking and revolting to the common instinct of civilized peoples, is\r\nincidental or subordinate to, the fact of aggressive war.\r\n\r\nAll the dramatic story of what went on in Germany in the early phases of\r\nthe conspiracy—the ideologies used, the techniques of terror used, the\r\nsuppressions of human freedom employed in the seizure of power, and even\r\nthe concentration camps and the crimes against humanity, the\r\npersecutions, tortures and murders committed—all these things would\r\nhave had little international juridical significance except for the fact\r\nthat they were the preparation for the commission of aggressions against\r\npeaceful neighboring peoples. Even the aspects of the case involving\r\n“war crimes” in the strict sense are merely the inevitable, proximate\r\nresult of the wars of aggression launched and waged by these\r\nconspirators, and of the kind of warfare they waged. It was total war,\r\nthe natural result of the totalitarian party-dominated state that waged\r\nit; it was atrocious war, the natural result of the doctrines, designs\r\nand purposes of the Nazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe substantive rule of law which is controlling on this part of the\r\ncase is stated in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military\r\nTribunal, which, so far as is pertinent here, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Article 6._ The Tribunal established by the Agreement referred\r\n    to in Article 1 hereof for the trial and punishment of the major\r\n    war criminals of the European Axis countries shall have the\r\n    power to try and punish persons who, acting in the interests of\r\n    the European Axis countries, either as individuals or as members\r\n    of organizations, committed any of the following crimes.\r\n\r\n    “The following acts, or any of them, are crimes coming within\r\n    the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for which there shall be\r\n    individual responsibility:\r\n\r\n    “(a) _Crimes against peace_: namely, planning, preparation,\r\n    initiation or waging of a war of aggression, or a war in\r\n    violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances,\r\n    or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the\r\n    accomplishment of any of the foregoing * * *”\r\n\r\n    “Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating\r\n    in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy\r\n    to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all\r\n    acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.”\r\n\r\nFive important principles are contained in these portions of the\r\nCharter:\r\n\r\n(1)  The Charter imposes “individual responsibility” for acts\r\nconstituting “crimes against peace”;\r\n\r\n(2)  The term “Crimes against peace” embraces planning, preparation,\r\ninitiation, or waging of illegal war;\r\n\r\n(3)  The term “Crimes against peace” also embraces participation in a\r\ncommon plan or conspiracy to commit illegal war;\r\n\r\n(4)  An illegal war consists of either a war of aggression, or a war in\r\nviolation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances; (these\r\ntwo kinds of illegal war might not necessarily be the same; it will be\r\nsufficient for the prosecution to show either that the war was\r\naggressive irrespective of breach of international treaties, agreements\r\nor assurances, or that the war was in violation of international\r\ntreaties, agreements or assurances irrespective of whether or not it was\r\na war of aggression; but the American prosecution will undertake to\r\nestablish that the wars planned, prepared, initiated, and waged by the\r\nNazi conspirators were illegal for both reasons);\r\n\r\n(5)  Individual criminal responsibility of a defendant is imposed by the\r\nCharter not merely by reasons of direct, immediate participation in the\r\ncrime. It is sufficient to show that a defendant was a leader, an\r\norganizer, instigator, or accomplice who participated either in the\r\nformulation or in the execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit\r\ncrimes against peace. In this connection, the Charter declares that the\r\nresponsibility of conspirators extends not only to their own acts but\r\nalso to all acts performed by any persons in execution of the\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nIt is familiar law in the United States that if two or more persons set\r\nout to rob a bank in accordance with a criminal scheme to that end, and\r\nin the course of carrying out their scheme one of the conspirators\r\ncommits the crime of murder, all the participants in the planning and\r\nexecution of the bank robbery are guilty of murder, whether or not they\r\nhad any other personal participation in the killing. This is a simple\r\nrule of law declared in the Charter. All the parties to a common plan or\r\nconspiracy are the agents of each other and each is responsible as\r\nprincipal for the acts of all the others as his agents.\r\n\r\nThe documentary evidence assembled on this aggressive war aspect of the\r\ncase will show the following: (1) the conspiratorial nature of the\r\nplanning and preparation which underlay the Nazi aggressions already\r\nknown to history; (2) the deliberate premeditation which preceded those\r\nacts of aggression; (3) the evil motives which led to the attacks; (4)\r\nthe individual participation of named persons in the Nazi conspiracy for\r\naggression; (5) the deliberate falsification of the pretexts claimed by\r\nthe Nazi aggressors as they arose for their criminal activities.\r\n\r\nThe critical period between the Nazi seizure of power and the initiation\r\nof the first war of aggression was very short. This critical period of\r\nillegal preparation and scheming, which ultimately set the whole world\r\naflame, covered 6 years, from 1933 to 1939. Crowded into these 6 short\r\nyears is the making of tragedy for mankind.\r\n\r\nA full understanding of these 6 years, and the 6 years of war that\r\nfollowed, requires that this period be divided into phases that reflect\r\nthe development and execution of the Nazi master plan. These phases may\r\nbe said to be six. The first was primarily preparatory, although it did\r\ninvolve overt acts. That phase covers roughly the period from 1933 to\r\n1936. In that period the Nazi conspirators, having acquired government\r\ncontrol of Germany by the middle of 1933, turned their attention toward\r\nutilization of that control for foreign aggression. Their plan at this\r\nstage was to acquire military strength and political bargaining power to\r\nbe used against other nations. In this they succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe second phase of their aggression was shorter. As the conspiracy\r\ngained strength it gained speed. During each phase the conspirators\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing more and more in less and less time until\r\ntoward the end of the period, the rate of acceleration of their\r\nconspiratorial movement was enormous. The second phase of their\r\nutilization of control for foreign aggression involved the actual\r\nseizure and absorption of Austria and Czechoslovakia, in that order. By\r\nMarch 1939 they had succeeded in this phase.\r\n\r\nThe third phase may be measured in months rather than years, from March\r\nto September 1939. The previous aggression being successful and having\r\nbeen consummated without the necessity of resorting to actual war, the\r\nconspirators had obtained much desired resources and bases and were\r\nready to undertake further aggressions by means of war, if necessary. By\r\nSeptember 1939 war was upon the world.\r\n\r\nThe fourth phase of the aggression consisted of expanding the war into a\r\ngeneral European war of aggression. By April 1941 the war which had\r\ntheretofore involved Poland, the United Kingdom, and France, had been\r\nexpanded by invasions into Scandinavia and into the Low Countries and\r\ninto the Balkans.\r\n\r\nIn the next phase the Nazi conspirators carried the war eastward by\r\ninvasion of the territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\r\nThe sixth phase consisted of collaboration with and instigation of their\r\nPacific ally, Japan, and precipitated the attack on the United States at\r\nPearl Harbor.\r\n\r\nThe essential elements of the crime of aggressive war can be made out by\r\na mere handful of captured German documents. These documents will leave\r\nno reasonable doubt concerning the aggressive character of the Nazi war\r\nor concerning the conspiratorial premeditation of that war. After the\r\ncorpus of the crime has been demonstrated in this way, the documentary\r\nevidence will be discussed in subsequent sections, in a more or less\r\nchronological and detailed presentation of the relevant activities of\r\nthe conspirators from 1933 to 1941.\r\n\r\nEach of the ten documents which will be discussed in this section has\r\nbeen selected to establish the basic facts concerning a particular phase\r\nof the development of the Nazi conspiracy for aggression. Each document\r\nhas met three standards of selection: each is conspiratorial in nature;\r\neach is believed to have been hitherto unknown to history; and each is\r\nself-contained and tells its own story.\r\n\r\nA. _1933 to 1936._\r\n\r\nThe period of 1933 to 1936 was characterized by an orderly, planned\r\nsequence of preparation for war. The essential objective of this period\r\nwas the formulation and execution of the plan to rearm and re-occupy and\r\nfortify the Rhineland, in violation of the treaty of Versailles and\r\nother treaties, in order to acquire military strength and political\r\nbargaining powers to be used against other nations.\r\n\r\nA secret speech of Hitler’s delivered to all supreme commanders on 23\r\nNovember 1939, at 1200 hours, is sufficient to characterize this phase\r\nof the Nazi conspiracy (_789-PS_). The report of the speech was found in\r\nthe OKW files captured at Flensberg. Hitler spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n    “November 23, 1939, 1200 hours. Conference with the Fuehrer, to\r\n    which all Supreme Commanders are ordered. The Fuehrer gives the\r\n    following speech:\r\n\r\n    “The purpose of this conference is to give you an idea of the\r\n    world of my thoughts, which takes charge of me, in the face of\r\n    future events, and to tell you my decisions. The building up of\r\n    our armed forces was only possible in connection with the\r\n    ideological [_weltanschaulich_] education of the German people\r\n    by the Party.\r\n\r\n    “When I started my political task in 1919, my strong belief in\r\n    final success was based on a thorough observation of the events\r\n    of the day and the study of the reasons for their occurrence.\r\n    Therefore, I never lost my belief in the midst of setbacks which\r\n    were not spared me during my period of struggle. Providence has\r\n    had the last word and brought me success. On top of that, I had\r\n    a clear recognition of the probable course of historical events,\r\n    and the firm will to make brutal decisions. The first decision\r\n    was in 1919 when I after long internal conflict became a\r\n    politician and took up the struggle against my enemies. That was\r\n    the hardest of all decisions. I had, however, the firm belief\r\n    that I would arrive at my goal. First of all, I desired a new\r\n    system of selection. I wanted to educate a minority which would\r\n    take over the leadership. After 15 years I arrived at my goal,\r\n    after strenuous struggles and many setbacks. When I came to\r\n    power in 1933, a period of the most difficult struggle lay\r\n    behind me. Everything existing before that had collapsed. I had\r\n    to reorganize everything beginning with the mass of the people\r\n    and extending it to the armed forces. First reorganization of\r\n    the interior, abolishment of appearances of decay and defeatist\r\n    ideas, education to heroism. While reorganizing the interior, I\r\n    undertook the second task: to release Germany from its\r\n    international ties. Two particular characteristics are to be\r\n    pointed out: secession from the League of Nations and\r\n    denunciation of the disarmament conference. It was a hard\r\n    decision. The number of prophets who predicted that it would\r\n    lead to the occupation of the Rhineland was large, the number of\r\n    believers was very small. I was supported by the nation, which\r\n    stood firmly behind me, when I carried out my intentions. After\r\n    that the order for rearmament. Here again there were numerous\r\n    prophets who predicted misfortunes, and only a few believers. In\r\n    1935 the introduction of compulsory armed service. After that\r\n    militarization of the Rhineland, again a process believed to be\r\n    impossible at that time. The number of people who put trust in\r\n    me was very small. Then beginning of the fortification of the\r\n    whole country especially in the west.\r\n\r\n    “One year later, Austria came. This step also was considered\r\n    doubtful. It brought about a considerable reinforcement of the\r\n    Reich. The next step was Bohemia, Moravia and Poland. This step\r\n    also was not possible to accomplish in one campaign. First of\r\n    all, the western fortification had to be finished. It was not\r\n    possible to reach the goal in one effort. It was clear to me\r\n    from the first moment that I could not be satisfied with the\r\n    Sudeten-German territory. That was only partial solution. The\r\n    decision to march into Bohemia was made. Then followed the\r\n    erection of the Protectorate, and with that basis for the action\r\n    against Poland was laid, but I wasn’t quite clear at that time\r\n    whether I should start first against the east and then in the\r\n    west, or vice-versa”. (_789-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere are some curious antitheses of thought in that, speech, as in most\r\nof Adolf Hitler’s speeches. In one sentence he combines guidance by\r\nprovidence with the making of “brutal decisions.” He constantly speaks\r\nof how very few people were with him, and yet the mass of the German\r\npeople were with him. But he does give a brief summary of this early\r\nperiod: the organization of the mass of the people, the extension of\r\norganization to the armed forces, and the various “brutal decisions”\r\nthat were made.\r\n\r\nA top secret letter dated 24 June 1935, from General von Blomberg to the\r\nSupreme Commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces demonstrates the\r\npreparations for war in which the Nazi conspirators were engaged during\r\nthis period. Attached to that letter is a copy of a Secret Reich Defense\r\nlaw of 21 May 1935, and a copy of a decision of the Reichcabinet of 21\r\nMay 1935 on the Council for the Defense of the Reich (_2261-PS_). These\r\ndocuments were captured in the OKW files at Fechenheim. Von Blomberg’s\r\nletter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the appendix I transmit one copy each of the law for the\r\n    defense of the Reich of the 21 May 1935, and of a decision of\r\n    the Reich Cabinet of 21 May 1935 concerning the Reich’s Defense\r\n    Council. The publication of the Reich’s defense law is\r\n    temporarily suspended by order of the Fuehrer and Reich\r\n    Chancellor.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and the Reichschancellor has nominated the\r\n    President of the directorate of the Reichsbank, Dr. Schacht to\r\n    be ‘Plenipotentiary-General for War economy’.\r\n\r\n    “I request that the copies of the Reich’s defense law needed\r\n    within the units of the armed forces be ordered before 1 July\r\n    1935 at armed forces office (L) where it is to be established\r\n    with the request that the law should only be distributed down to\r\n    Corps Headquarters outside of the Reichministry of war.\r\n\r\n    “I point out the necessity of strictest secrecy once more.”\r\n    (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nUnderneath von Blomberg’s signature is an indorsement, “Berlin, 3\r\nSeptember 1935; No. 1820/35 L Top Secret II a. To Defense-Economic Group\r\nG-3, copy transmitted (signed) Jodl.” (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nAttached to this letter is the statute referred to as the Reich’s\r\nDefense Law of 21 May 1935, enacted by the Reichscabinet. The law covers\r\nin detail preparations for a state of defense, mobilization, and\r\nappointment of the Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy (Schacht)\r\nwith plenipotentiary authority for the economic preparation of the war.\r\nPart III provides for penalties. The law is signed, “The Fuehrer and\r\nReichschancellor, Adolf Hitler; the Reichsminister of War, von Blomberg;\r\nthe Reichsminister of the Interior, Frick.” At the bottom of it there is\r\nthis note:\r\n\r\n    “Note on the law for the defense of the Reich of 21 May 1935.\r\n\r\n    “The publication of the law for the defense of the Reich of 21\r\n    May 1935 will be suspended. The law became effective 21 May\r\n    1935.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and Reichschancellor, Adolf Hitler.” (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, although the publication itself stated the law was made public,\r\nand although the law became effective immediately, publication was\r\nsuspended by Adolf Hitler.\r\n\r\nThere was also further attached to von Blomberg’s letter a copy of the\r\ndecision of the Reichscabinet of 21 May 1935 on the Council for the\r\nDefense of the Realm. This decree deals largely with organization for\r\neconomic preparation for the war. This law of May 1935 was the\r\ncornerstone of war preparations of the Nazi conspirators, and makes\r\nclear the relationship of Schacht to this preparation. (_2261-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Formulation and Execution of Plans to Invade Austria and\r\nCzechoslovakia._\r\n\r\nThe next phase of aggression was the formulation and execution of plans\r\nto attack Austria and Czechoslovakia, in that order.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking and revealing of all the captured documents\r\nwhich have come to hand is one which has come to be known as the\r\nHossbach notes of a conference in the Reichs Chancellery on 5 November\r\n1937 from 1615 to 2030 hours (_386-PS_). In the course of that meeting\r\nHitler outlined to those present the possibilities and necessities of\r\nexpanding their foreign policy, and requested, “That his statements be\r\nlooked upon in the case of his death as his last will and testament.”\r\nThe recorder of the minutes of this meeting, Colonel Hossbach, was the\r\nFuehrer’s adjutant. Present at this conspiratorial meeting, among\r\nothers, were Erich Raeder, Constantin von Neurath, and Hermann Wilhelm\r\nGoering. The minutes of this meeting reveal a crystalization towards the\r\nend of 1937 in the policy of the Nazi regime (_386-PS_). Austria and\r\nCzechoslovakia were to be acquired by force. They would provide\r\n“_lebensraum_” (living space) and improve Germany’s military position\r\nfor further operations. While it is true that actual events unfolded\r\nthemselves in a somewhat different manner than that outlined at this\r\nmeeting, in essence the purposes stated at the meeting were carried out.\r\nThese notes, which destroy any possible doubt concerning the Nazi’s\r\npremeditation of their crimes against peace, read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Berlin, 10 November 1937. Notes on the conference in the\r\n    Reichskanzlei on 5 November 1937 from 1615 to 2030 hours.\r\n\r\n    “Present: The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor;\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsminister for War, Generalfeldmarschall v. Blomberg;\r\n\r\n    “The C-in-C Army, Generaloberst Freiherr v. Fritsch;\r\n\r\n    “The C-in-C Navy, Generaladmiral Dr. h.c. Raeder;\r\n\r\n    “The C-in-C Luftwaffe, Generaloberst Goering;\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs, Freiherr v. Neurath;\r\n\r\n    “Oberst Hossbach [the adjutant who took the minutes].\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer stated initially that the subject matter of today’s\r\n    conference was of such high importance, that its detailed\r\n    discussion would certainly in other states take place before the\r\n    Cabinet in full session. However, he, the Fuehrer, had decided\r\n    not to discuss this matter in the larger circle of the Reich\r\n    Cabinet, because of its importance. His subsequent statements\r\n    were the result of detailed deliberations and of the experiences\r\n    of his four and a half years in government; he desired to\r\n    explain to those present his fundamental ideas on the\r\n    possibilities and necessities of expanding our foreign policy\r\n    and in the interests of a far-sighted policy he requested that\r\n    his statements be looked upon in the case of his death as his\r\n    last will and testament.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer then stated: The aim of German policy is the\r\n    security and the preservation of the nation and its propagation.\r\n    This is consequently a problem of space. The German nation\r\n    comprises eighty-five million people, which, because of the\r\n    number of individuals and the compactness of habitation form a\r\n    homogeneous European racial body, the like of which can not be\r\n    found in any other country. On the other hand it justifies the\r\n    demand for larger living space more than for any other nation.\r\n    If there have been no political consequences to meet the demands\r\n    of this racial body for living space then that is the result of\r\n    historical development spread over several centuries and should\r\n    this political condition continue to exist, it will represent\r\n    the greatest danger to the preservation of the German nation at\r\n    its present high level. An arrest of the deterioration of the\r\n    German element in Austria and in Czechoslovakia is just as\r\n    little possible as the preservation of the present state in\r\n    Germany itself.\r\n\r\n    “Instead of growth, sterility will be introduced, and as a\r\n    consequence, tensions of a social nature will appear after a\r\n    number of years, because political and philosophical ideas are\r\n    of a permanent nature only as long as they are able to produce\r\n    the basis for the realization of the actual claim of existence\r\n    of a nation. The German future is therefore dependent\r\n    exclusively on the solution of the need for living space. Such a\r\n    solution can be sought naturally only for a limited period,\r\n    about one to three generations.\r\n\r\n    “Before touching upon the question of solving the need for\r\n    living space, it must be decided whether a solution of the\r\n    German position with a good future can be attained, either by\r\n    way of an autarchy or by way of an increased share in universal\r\n    commerce and industry.\r\n\r\n    “Autarchy: Execution will be possible only with strict\r\n    National-Socialist State policy, which is the basis; assuming\r\n    this can be achieved the results are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “A. In the sphere of raw materials, only limited, but not total\r\n    autarchy can be attained:\r\n\r\n    “1. Wherever coal can be used for the extraction of raw\r\n    materials autarchy is feasible.\r\n\r\n    “2. In the case of ores the position is much more difficult.\r\n    Requirements in iron and light metals can be covered by\r\n    ourselves. Copper and tin, however, can not.\r\n\r\n    “3. Cellular materials can be covered by ourselves as long as\r\n    sufficient wood supplies exist. A permanent solution is not\r\n    possible.\r\n\r\n    “4. Edible fats—possible.\r\n\r\n    “B. In the case of foods, the question of an autarchy must be\r\n    answered with a definite NO.\r\n\r\n    “The general increase of living standards, compared with thirty\r\n    to forty years ago, brought about a simultaneous increase of the\r\n    demand and an increase of personal consumption even among the\r\n    producers, the farmers, themselves. The proceeds from the\r\n    production increase in agriculture have been used for covering\r\n    the increased demand, therefore they represent no absolute\r\n    increase in production. A further increase in production by\r\n    making greater demands on the soil is not possible because it\r\n    already shows signs of deterioration due to the use of\r\n    artificial fertilizers, and it is therefore certain that, even\r\n    with the greatest possible increase in production, participation\r\n    in the world market could not be avoided.\r\n\r\n    “The considerable expenditure of foreign currency to secure food\r\n    by import, even in periods when harvests are good, increases\r\n    catastrophically when the harvest is really poor. The\r\n    possibility of this catastrophe increases correspondingly to the\r\n    increase in population, and the annual 560,000 excess in births\r\n    would bring about an increased consumption in bread, because the\r\n    child is a greater bread eater than the adult.\r\n\r\n    “Permanently to counter the difficulties of food supplies by\r\n    lowering the standard of living and by rationing is impossible\r\n    in a continent which had developed an approximately equivalent\r\n    standard of living. As the solving of the unemployment problem\r\n    has brought into effect the complete power of consumption, some\r\n    small corrections in our agricultural home production will be\r\n    possible, but not a wholesale alteration of the standard of food\r\n    consumption. Consequently autarchy becomes impossible,\r\n    specifically in the sphere of food supplies as well as\r\n    generally.\r\n\r\n    “Participation in world economy. There are limits to this which\r\n    we are unable to transgress. The market fluctuations would be an\r\n    obstacle to a secure foundation of the German position;\r\n    international commercial agreements do not offer any guarantee\r\n    for practical execution. It must be considered on principle that\r\n    since the World War (1914-18), as industrialization has taken\r\n    place in countries which formerly exported food. We live in a\r\n    period of economic empires, in which the tendency to colonies\r\n    again approaches the condition which originally motivated\r\n    colonization; in Japan and Italy economic motives are the basis\r\n    of their will to expand, and economic need will also drive\r\n    Germany to it. Countries outside the great economic empires have\r\n    special difficulties in expanding economically.\r\n\r\n    “The upward tendency, which has been caused in world economy,\r\n    due to armament competition, can never form a permanent basis\r\n    for an economic settlement, and this latter is also hampered by\r\n    the economic disruption caused by Bolshevism. There is a\r\n    pronounced military weakness in those states who base their\r\n    existence on export. As our exports and imports are carried out\r\n    over those sea lanes which are dominated by Britain, it is more\r\n    a question of security of transport than one of foreign\r\n    currency, and this explains the great weakness in our food\r\n    situation in wartime. The only way out, and one which may appear\r\n    imaginary, is the securing of greater living space, an endeavor\r\n    which at all times has been the cause of the formation of states\r\n    and of movements of nations. It is explicable that this tendency\r\n    finds no interest in Geneva and in satisfied states. Should the\r\n    security of our food situation be our foremost thought, then the\r\n    space required for this can only be sought in Europe, but we\r\n    will not copy liberal capitalist policies which rely on\r\n    exploiting colonies. It is not a case of conquering people, but\r\n    of conquering agriculturally useful space. It would also be more\r\n    to the purpose to seek raw material-producing territory in\r\n    Europe directly adjoining the Reich and not overseas, and this\r\n    solution would have to be brought into effect for one or two\r\n    generations. What would be required at a later date over and\r\n    above this must be left to subsequent, generations. The\r\n    development of great worldwide national bodies is naturally a\r\n    slow process and the German people, with its strong racial root\r\n    [Volksstamm] has for this purpose the most favorable foundations\r\n    in the heart of the European Continent. The history of all\r\n    times—Roman Empire, British Empire—has proved that every space\r\n    expansion can only be effected by breaking resistance and taking\r\n    risks. Even setbacks are unavoidable; neither formerly nor today\r\n    has space been found without an owner; the attacker always comes\r\n    up against the proprietor.” (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter this somewhat jumbled discussion of geopolitical economic theory\r\nand of the need for expansion and “_Lebensraum_”, Adolf Hitler, in these\r\nHossbach notes, posed a question and proceeded to answer it:\r\n\r\n    “The question for Germany is where the greatest possible\r\n    conquest could be made at lowest cost.\r\n\r\n    “German politics must reckon with its two hateful enemies,\r\n    England and France, to whom a strong German colossus in the\r\n    center of Europe would be intolerable. Both these states would\r\n    oppose a further reinforcement of Germany, both in Europe and\r\n    overseas, and in this opposition they would have the support of\r\n    all parties. Both countries would view the building of German\r\n    military strong points overseas as a threat to their overseas\r\n    communications, as a security measure for German commerce, and\r\n    retrospectively a strengthening of the German position in\r\n    Europe.\r\n\r\n    “England is not in a position to cede any of her colonial\r\n    possessions to us owing to the resistance which she experiences\r\n    in the Dominions. After the loss of prestige which England has\r\n    suffered owing to the transfer of Abyssinia to Italian\r\n    ownership, a return of East Africa can no longer be expected.\r\n    Any resistance on England’s part would at best consist in the\r\n    readiness to satisfy our colonial claims by taking away colonies\r\n    which at the present moment are not in British hands, for\r\n    example, Angola. French favors would probably be of the same\r\n    nature.\r\n\r\n    “A serious discussion regarding the return of colonies to us\r\n    could be considered only at a time when England is in a state of\r\n    emergency and the German Reich is strong and well armed. The\r\n    Fuehrer does not share the opinion that the Empire is\r\n    unshakeable.\r\n\r\n    “Resistance against the Empire is to be found less in conquered\r\n    territories than amongst its competitors. The British Empire and\r\n    the Roman Empire cannot be compared with one another in regard\r\n    to durability; after the Punic Wars the latter did not have a\r\n    serious political enemy. Only the dissolving effects which\r\n    originated in Christendom, and the signs of age which creep into\r\n    all states, made it possible for the Ancient Germans to\r\n    subjugate Ancient Rome.\r\n\r\n    “Alongside the British Empire today a number of States exist\r\n    which are stronger than it. The British Mother Country is able\r\n    to defend its colonial possession only allied with other states\r\n    and not by its own power. How could England alone, for example,\r\n    defend Canada against attack by America, or its Far Eastern\r\n    interests against an attack by Japan?\r\n\r\n    “The singling out of the British Crown as the bearer of Empire\r\n    unity is in itself an admission that the universal empire cannot\r\n    be maintained permanently by power politics. The following are\r\n    significant pointers in this respect:\r\n\r\n    “(a)  Ireland’s struggle for independence.\r\n\r\n    “(b)  Constitutional disputes in India where England, by her\r\n    half measures, left the door open for Indians at a later date to\r\n    utilize the non-fulfillment of constitutional promises as a\r\n    weapon against Britain.\r\n\r\n    “(c)  The weakening of the British position in the Far East by\r\n    Japan.\r\n\r\n    “(d)  The opposition in the Mediterranean to Italy which—by\r\n    virtue of its history, driven by necessity and led by a\r\n    genius—expands its power position and must consequently\r\n    infringe British interests to an increasing extent. The outcome\r\n    of the Abyssinian War is a loss of prestige for Britain which\r\n    Italy is endeavoring to increase by stirring up discontent in\r\n    the Mohammedan World.\r\n\r\n    “It must be established in conclusion that the Empire cannot be\r\n    held permanently by power politics by 45 million Britons, in\r\n    spite of all the solidity of her ideals. The proportion of the\r\n    populations in the Empire, compared with that of the Motherland,\r\n    is nine to one, and it should act as a warning to us that if we\r\n    expand in space, we must not allow the level of our population\r\n    to become too low.\r\n\r\n    “France’s position is more favorable than that of England. The\r\n    French Empire is better placed geographically, the population of\r\n    its colonial possessions represents a potential military\r\n    increase. But France is faced with difficulties of internal\r\n    politics. At the present time only 10 per cent approximately of\r\n    the nations have parliamentary governments, whereas 90 per cent\r\n    of them have totalitarian governments. Nevertheless, we have to\r\n    take the following into our political consideration as power\r\n    factors:\r\n\r\n    “Britain, France, Russia and the adjoining smaller states.\r\n\r\n    “The German question can be solved only by way of force, and\r\n    this is never without risk. The battles of Frederick the Great\r\n    for Silesia, and Bismarck’s wars against Austria and France had\r\n    been a tremendous risk and the speed of Prussian action in 1870\r\n    had prevented Austria from participating in the war. If we place\r\n    the decision to apply force with risk at the head of the\r\n    following expositions, then we are left to reply to the\r\n    questions ‘when’ and ‘how’. In this regard we have to decide\r\n    upon three different cases.\r\n\r\n    “Case 1. Period 1943-45: After this we can only expect a change\r\n    for the worse. The rearming of the Army, the Navy and the Air\r\n    Force, as well as the formation of the Officers’ Corps, are\r\n    practically concluded.\r\n\r\n    “Our material equipment and armaments are modern; with further\r\n    delay the danger of their becoming out-of-date will increase. In\r\n    particular the secrecy of ‘special weapons’ cannot always be\r\n    safeguarded. Enlistment of reserves would be limited to the\r\n    current recruiting age groups and an addition from older\r\n    untrained groups would be no longer available.\r\n\r\n    “In comparison with the rearmament, which will have been carried\r\n    out at the time by other nations, we shall decrease in relative\r\n    power. Should we not act until 1943-45, then, dependent on the\r\n    absence of reserves, any year could bring about the food crisis,\r\n    for the countering of which we do not possess the necessary\r\n    foreign currency. This must be considered as a ‘point of\r\n    weakness in the regime.’ Over and above that, the world will\r\n    anticipate our action and will increase counter-measures yearly.\r\n    Whilst other nations isolate themselves we should be forced on\r\n    the offensive.\r\n\r\n    “What the actual position would be in the years 1943-45 no one\r\n    knows today. It is certain, however, that we can wait no longer.\r\n\r\n    “On the one side the large armed forces, with the necessity for\r\n    securing their upkeep, the aging of the Nazi movement and of its\r\n    leaders, and on the other side the prospect of a lowering of the\r\n    standard of living and a drop in the birth rate, leaves us no\r\n    other choice but to act. If the Fuehrer is still living, then it\r\n    will be his irrevocable decision to solve the German space\r\n    problem no later than 1943-45. The necessity for action before\r\n    1943-45 will come under consideration in cases 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n    “Case 2. Should the social tensions in France lead to an\r\n    internal political crisis of such dimensions that it absorbs the\r\n    French Army and thus renders it incapable for employment in war\r\n    against Germany, then the time for action against Czechoslovakia\r\n    has come.\r\n\r\n    “Case 3. It would be equally possible to act against\r\n    Czechoslovakia if France should be so tied up by a war against\r\n    another State that it cannot ‘proceed’ against Germany.\r\n\r\n    “For the improvement of our military political position it must\r\n    be our first aim, in every case of entanglement by war, to\r\n    conquer Czechoslovakia and Austria, simultaneously, in order to\r\n    remove any threat from the flanks in case of a possible advance\r\n    Westwards. In the case of a conflict with France it would hardly\r\n    be necessary to assume that Czechoslovakia would declare war on\r\n    the same day as France. However, Czechoslovakia’s desire to\r\n    participate in the war will increase proportionally to the\r\n    degree to which we are being weakened. Its actual participation\r\n    could make itself felt by an attack on Silesia, either towards\r\n    the North or the West.\r\n\r\n    “Once Czechoslovakia is conquered—and a mutual frontier,\r\n    Germany-Hungary is obtained—then a neutral attitude by Poland\r\n    in a German-French conflict could more easily be relied upon.\r\n    Our agreements with Poland remain valid only as long as\r\n    Germany’s strength remains unshakeable; should Germany have any\r\n    setbacks then an attack by Poland against East Prussia, perhaps\r\n    also against Pomerania, and Silesia, must be taken into account.\r\n\r\n    “Assuming a development of the situation, which would lead to a\r\n    planned attack on our part in the years 1943 to ’45, then the\r\n    behaviour of France, England, Poland and Russia would probably\r\n    have to be judged in the following manner.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer believes personally, that in all probability\r\n    England and perhaps also France, have already silently written\r\n    off Czechoslovakia, and that they have got used to the idea that\r\n    this question would one day be cleaned up by Germany. The\r\n    difficulties in the British Empire and the prospect of being\r\n    entangled in another long-drawn-out European War, were decisive\r\n    factors in the nonparticipation of England in a war against\r\n    Germany. The British attitude would certainly not remain without\r\n    influence on France’s attitude. An attack by France, without\r\n    British support, is hardly probable assuming that its offensive\r\n    would stagnate along our Western fortifications. Without\r\n    England’s support, it would also not be necessary to take into\r\n    consideration a march by France through Belgium and Holland, and\r\n    this would also not have to be reckoned with by us in case of a\r\n    conflict with France, as in every case it would have as a\r\n    consequence, the enmity of Great Britain. Naturally we should in\r\n    every case, have to bar our frontier during the operation of our\r\n    attacks against Czechoslovakia and Austria. It must be taken\r\n    into consideration here that Czechoslovakia’s defence measures\r\n    will increase in strength from year to year, and that a\r\n    consolidation of the inside values of the Austrian Army will\r\n    also be effected in the course of years. Although the population\r\n    of Czechoslovakia, in the first place is not a thin one, the\r\n    embodiment of Czechoslovakia and Austria would nevertheless\r\n    constitute the conquest of food for five to six million people,\r\n    on the basis that a compulsory emigration of two million from\r\n    Czechoslovakia, and of one million from Austria could be carried\r\n    out. The annexation of the two States to Germany, militarily and\r\n    politically, would constitute a considerable relief, owing to\r\n    shorter and better frontiers, the freeing of fighting personnel\r\n    for other purposes, and the possibility of reconstituting new\r\n    armies up to a strength of about twelve Divisions, representing\r\n    a new Division per one million population.\r\n\r\n    “No opposition to the removal of Czechoslovakia is expected on\r\n    the part of Italy; however, it cannot be judged today what would\r\n    be her attitude in the Austrian question, since it would depend\r\n    largely on whether the Duce were alive at the time or not.\r\n\r\n    “The measure and speed of our action would decide Poland’s\r\n    attitude. Poland will have little inclination to enter the war\r\n    against a victorious Germany, with Russia in the rear.\r\n\r\n    “Military participation by Russia must be countered by the speed\r\n    of our operations; it is a question whether this needs to be\r\n    taken into consideration at all, in view of Japan’s attitude.\r\n\r\n    “Should Case 2 occur—paralyzation of France by a Civil\r\n    War—then the situation should be utilized _at any time_ for\r\n    operations against Czechoslovakia, as Germany’s most dangerous\r\n    enemy would be eliminated.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer sees Case 3 looming near; it could develop from the\r\n    existing tensions in the Mediterranean, and should it occur, he\r\n    has firmly decided to make use of it any time, perhaps even as\r\n    early as 1938.\r\n\r\n    “Following recent experiences in the course of events of the war\r\n    in Spain, the Fuehrer does not see an early end to hostilities\r\n    there. Taking into consideration the time required for past\r\n    offensives by Franco, a further three years duration of war is\r\n    within the bounds of possibility. On the other hand, from the\r\n    German point of view, a one hundred per cent victory by Franco\r\n    is not desirable; we are more interested in a continuation of\r\n    the war and preservation of the tensions in the Mediterranean.\r\n    Should Franco be in sole possession of the Spanish Peninsula, it\r\n    would mean the end of Italian intervention and the presence of\r\n    Italy on the Balearic Isles. As our interests are directed\r\n    towards continuing the war in Spain, it must be the task of our\r\n    future policy to strengthen Italy in her fight to hold on to the\r\n    Balearic Isles. However, a solidification of Italian positions\r\n    on the Balearic Isles can not be tolerated either by France or\r\n    by England and could lead to a war by France and England against\r\n    Italy, in which case Spain, if entirely in white [Franco’s]\r\n    hands, could participate on the side of Italy’s enemies. A\r\n    subjugation of Italy in such a war appears very unlikely.\r\n    Additional raw materials could be brought to Italy via Germany.\r\n    The Fuehrer believes that Italy’s military strategy would be to\r\n    remain on the defensive against France on the Western frontier\r\n    and carry out operations against France from Libya, against the\r\n    North African French colonial possessions.\r\n\r\n    “As a landing of French-British troops on the Italian coast can\r\n    be discounted, and as a French offensive via the Alps to Upper\r\n    Italy would be extremely difficult, and would probably stagnate\r\n    before the strong Italian fortifications, French lines of\r\n    communication by the Italian fleet will to a great extent\r\n    paralyze the transport of fighting personnel from North Africa\r\n    to France, so that at its frontiers with Italy and Germany,\r\n    France will have, at its disposal, solely the metropolitan\r\n    fighting forces.\r\n\r\n    “If Germany profits from this war by disposing of the\r\n    Czechoslovakian and the Austrian questions, the probability must\r\n    be assumed that England—being at war with Italy—would not\r\n    decide to commence operations against Germany. Without British\r\n    support, a warlike action by France against Germany is not to be\r\n    anticipated.\r\n\r\n    “The date of our attack on Czechoslovakia and Austria must be\r\n    made independent of the course of the Italian-French-English war\r\n    and would not be simultaneous with the commencement of military\r\n    operations by these three States. The Fuehrer was also not\r\n    thinking of military agreements with Italy, but in complete\r\n    independence and by exploiting this unique favorable\r\n    opportunity, he wishes to begin to carry out operations against\r\n    Czechoslovakia. The attack on Czechoslovakia would have to take\r\n    place with the speed of lightning [_blitzartig schnell_].\r\n\r\n    “Fieldmarshal von Blomberg and Generaloberst von Fritsch in\r\n    giving their estimate on the situation, repeatedly pointed out\r\n    that England and France must not appear as our enemies, and they\r\n    stated that the war with Italy would not bind the French Army to\r\n    such an extent that it would not be in a position to commence\r\n    operations on our Western frontier with superior forces.\r\n    Generaloberst von Fritsch estimated the French forces which\r\n    would presumably be employed on the Alpine frontier against\r\n    Italy to be in the region of twenty divisions, so that a strong\r\n    French superiority would still remain on our Western frontier.\r\n    The French would, according to German reasoning, attempt to\r\n    advance into the Rhineland. We should consider the lead which\r\n    France has got in mobilization, and quite apart from the very\r\n    small value of our then existing fortifications—which was\r\n    pointed out particularly by Generalfieldmarshal von\r\n    Blomberg—the four motorized divisions which had been laid down\r\n    for the West would be more or less incapable of movement. With\r\n    regard to our offensive in a Southeasterly direction,\r\n    Fieldmarshal von Blomberg drew special attention to the strength\r\n    of the Czechoslovakian fortifications, the building of which\r\n    had, assumed the character of a Maginot Line and which would\r\n    present extreme difficulties to our attack.\r\n\r\n    “Generaloberst von Fritsch mentioned that it was the purpose of\r\n    a study which he had laid on for this winter to investigate the\r\n    possibilities of carrying out operations against Czechoslovakia\r\n    with special consideration of the conquest of the\r\n    Czechoslovakian system of fortifications; the Generaloberst also\r\n    stated that owing to the prevailing conditions, he would have to\r\n    relinquish his leave abroad, which was to begin on the 10\r\n    November. This intention was countermanded by the Fuehrer, who\r\n    gave as a reason that the possibility of the conflict was not to\r\n    be regarded as being so imminent. In reply to statements by\r\n    Generalfieldmarshal von Blomberg and Generaloberst von Fritsch\r\n    regarding England and France’s attitude, the Fuehrer repeated\r\n    his previous statements and said that he was convinced of\r\n    Britain’s nonparticipation and that consequently he did not\r\n    believe in military action by France against Germany. Should the\r\n    Mediterranean conflict already mentioned, lead to a general\r\n    mobilization in Europe, then we should have to commence\r\n    operations against Czechoslovakia immediately. If, however, the\r\n    powers who are not participating in the war should declare their\r\n    disinterestedness, then Germany would, for the time being, have\r\n    to side with this attitude.\r\n\r\n    “In view of the information given by the Fuehrer, Generaloberst\r\n    Goering considered it imperative to think of a reduction or\r\n    abandonment of our military undertaking in Spain. The Fuehrer\r\n    agreed to this, insofar as he believed this decision should be\r\n    postponed for a suitable date.\r\n\r\n    “The second part of the discussion concerned material armament\r\n    questions.\r\n\r\n    “(Signed) Hossbach”. (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe record of what happened thereafter is well-known to history. The\r\nAnschluss with Austria, under military pressure from the Nazis, occurred\r\nin March 1938. Pressure on Czechoslovakia resulted in the Munich Pact of\r\nSeptember 1938. That Pact was violated, and Czechoslovakia invaded by\r\nGermany on 15 March 1939.\r\n\r\nAnother captured document, a file kept by Colonel Schmundt, Hitler’s\r\nadjutant, reveals the truth concerning the deliberateness of the\r\naggressions against Czechoslovakia (_388-PS_). The file was found in a\r\ncellar of the Platterhof at Obersalzberg, near Berchtesgaden. It\r\nconsists of a work-file of originals and duplicates, incidental to the\r\npreparations for the annexation of Czechoslovakia. The German title is\r\n“_Grundlagen zur Studie Gruen_”, (Basic Principles for “Case Green”),\r\n“Green” being a codeword for the aggression against Czechoslovakia. Item\r\nNo. 2 in this file is dated 22 April 1938. It is a summary, prepared by\r\nSchmundt, the adjutant, of a discussion on 21 April 1938 between Hitler\r\nand Wilhelm Keitel. This item, like the other items in the file, relates\r\nto “Case Green”. This meeting occurred within approximately one month\r\nfollowing the successful annexation of Austria. In the carrying out of\r\nthe conspiracy, it became necessary to revise the “Plan Green”, to take\r\ninto account changed conditions, as a result of the bloodless success\r\nagainst Austria. Item 2 reads:\r\n\r\n    “Berlin, 22 April 1938.\r\n\r\n    “Bases of the Dissertation on _Gruen_.\r\n\r\n    “Summary of discussion between Fuehrer and General Keitel of 21\r\n    April:\r\n\r\n    “A.  Political Aspect.\r\n\r\n    “1.  Strategic surprise attack out of a clear sky without any\r\n    cause or possibility of justification has been turned down. As\r\n    result would be: hostile world opinion which can lead to a\r\n    critical situation. Such a measure is justified only for the\r\n    elimination of the _last_ opponent on the mainland.\r\n\r\n    “2.  Action after a time of diplomatic clashes, which gradually\r\n    come to a crisis and lead to war.\r\n\r\n    “3.  Lightning-swift action as the result of an incident (for\r\n    example, assassination of German ambassador in connection with\r\n    an anti-German demonstration.)\r\n\r\n    “Military Conclusions.\r\n\r\n    “1.  The preparations are to be made for the political\r\n    possibilities (2 and 3). Case 2 is the undesired one since\r\n    “_Gruen_” will have taken security measures.\r\n\r\n    “2.  The loss of time caused by transporting the bulk of the\r\n    divisions by rail—which is unavailable, but should be cut down\r\n    as far as possible—must not impede a lightning-swift blow at\r\n    the time of the action.\r\n\r\n    “3.  ‘Separate thrusts’ are to be carried out immediately with a\r\n    view to penetrating the enemy fortification lines at numerous\r\n    points and in a strategically favorable direction. The thrusts\r\n    are to be worked out to the smallest detail (knowledge of roads,\r\n    composition of the columns according to their individual tasks).\r\n    Simultaneous attacks by the Army and Air Force.\r\n\r\n    “The Air Force is to support the individual columns (for example\r\n    divebombers; sealing off installations at penetration points,\r\n    hampering the bringing up of reserves, destroying signal\r\n    communications traffic, thereby isolating the garrisons.)\r\n\r\n    “4.  Politically, the first four days of military action are the\r\n    decisive ones. If there are no effective military successes, a\r\n    European crisis will certainly arise. Accomplished Facts must\r\n    prove the senselessness of foreign military intervention, draw\r\n    Allies into the scheme (division of spoils) and demoralize\r\n    ‘_Gruen_.’\r\n\r\n    “Therefore: bridging the time gap between first penetration and\r\n    employment of the forces to be brought up, by a determined and\r\n    ruthless thrust by a motorized army. (e.g. via Pilsen, Prague.)\r\n\r\n    “5.  If possible, separation of transport movement ‘_Rot_’ from\r\n    ‘_Gruen_’. [‘_Rot_’ was the code name for their then plan\r\n    against the West.] A simultaneous strategic concentration\r\n    ‘_Rot_’ can lead ‘_Rot_’ to undesired measures. On the other\r\n    hand, it must be possible to put ‘_Case Rot_’ into operation at\r\n    any time.\r\n\r\n    “C.  Propaganda.\r\n\r\n    “1.  Leaflets on the conduct of Germans in Czechoslovakia\r\n    (_Gruenland_.)\r\n\r\n    “2.  Leaflets with threats for intimidation of the Czechs\r\n    (_Gruenen_).\r\n\r\n    [Initialled by Schmundt]” (_388-PS_)\r\n\r\nParticular attention should be drawn to paragraph 3 of this document,\r\nunder the heading “Political Aspect”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Lightning-swift action as the result of an incident (example:\r\n    Assassination of German ambassador as an upshot of an\r\n    anti-German demonstration).” (_388-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe document as a whole establishes that the conspirators were planning\r\nthe creation of an incident to justify to the world their own aggression\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia. It establishes that consideration was being\r\ngiven to assassinating the German ambassador at Prague to create the\r\nrequisite incident.\r\n\r\nC. _Formulation and Execution of the Plan to Invade Poland._\r\n\r\nThe next phase of the aggression was the formulation and execution of\r\nthe plan to attack Poland, resulting in the initiation of aggressive war\r\nin September 1939. Here again the careful and meticulous record keeping\r\nof Hitler’s adjutant, Schmundt, has provided a document in his own\r\nhandwriting which throws down the mask (_L-79_). The document consists\r\nof minutes of a conference held on 23 May 1939. The place of the\r\nconference was the Fuehrer’s Study in the New Reich Chancellery.\r\nGoering, Raeder and Keitel were present. The subject of the meeting was,\r\n“Indoctrination on the political situation and future aims.”\r\n\r\nThe authenticity and accuracy of Schmundt’s record of the meeting of 23\r\nMay 1939 has been admitted by Keitel in a pretrial interrogation. The\r\nminutes read as follows:\r\n\r\n          “Top Secret\r\n\r\n    “To be transmitted by officer only\r\n\r\n    “Minutes of a Conference on 23 May 39”\r\n\r\n    “Place: The Fuehrer’s Study, New Reich Chancellery.\r\n\r\n    “Adjutant on duty: Lt-Col. (G.S.) Schmundt.\r\n\r\n    “Present: The Fuehrer, Field-Marshal Goering, Grand-Admiral\r\n    Raeder, Col-Gen. von Brauchitsch, Col-Gen. Keitel, Col-Gen.\r\n    Milch, Gen. (of Artillery) Halder, Gen. Bodenschatz, Rear-Adml.\r\n    Schniewindt, Col. (G.S.) Jeschonnek, Col. (G.S.) Warlimont,\r\n    Lt-Col. (G.S.) Schmundt, Capt. Engel (Army), Lieut-Commd.\r\n    Albrecht, Capt. v. Below (Army).\r\n\r\n    “Subject: Indoctrination on the political situation and future\r\n    aims.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer defined as the purpose of the conference:\r\n\r\n    “1. Analysis of the situation.\r\n\r\n    “2. Definition of the tasks for the Armed Forces arising from\r\n    the situation.\r\n\r\n    “3. Exposition of the consequences of those tasks.\r\n\r\n    “4. Ensuring the secrecy of all decisions and work resulting\r\n    from these consequences.\r\n\r\n    “Secrecy is the first essential for success.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer’s observations are given in systematized form\r\n    below.\r\n\r\n    “Our present situation must be considered from two points of\r\n    view:\r\n\r\n    “1. The actual development of events between 1933 and 1939;\r\n\r\n    “2. The permanent and unchanging situation in which Germany\r\n    lies.\r\n\r\n    “In the period 1933-1939, progress was made in all fields.\r\n\r\n    Our military situation improved enormously.\r\n\r\n    “Our situation with regard to the rest of the world has remained\r\n    the same.\r\n\r\n    “Germany had dropped from the circle of Great Powers. The\r\n    balance of power had been effected without the participation of\r\n    Germany.\r\n\r\n    “This equilibrium is disturbed when Germany’s demands for the\r\n    necessities of life make themselves felt, and Germany re-emerges\r\n    as a Great Power. All demands are regarded as ‘Encroachments’.\r\n    The English are more afraid of dangers in the economic sphere\r\n    than of the simple threat of force.\r\n\r\n    “A mass of 80 million people has solved the ideological\r\n    problems. So, too, must the economic problems be solved. No\r\n    German can evade the creation of the necessary economic\r\n    conditions for this. The solution of the problems demands\r\n    courage. The principle, by which one evades solving the problem\r\n    by adapting oneself to circumstances, is inadmissible.\r\n    Circumstances must rather be adapted to aims. This is impossible\r\n    without invasion of foreign states or attacks upon foreign\r\n    property.\r\n\r\n    “Living space, in proportion to the magnitude of the state, is\r\n    the basis of all power. One may refuse for a time to face the\r\n    problem, but finally it is solved one way or the other. The\r\n    choice is between advancement or decline. In 15 or 20 years’\r\n    time we shall be compelled to find a solution. No German\r\n    statesman can evade the question longer than that.\r\n\r\n    “We are at present in a state of patriotic fervour, which is\r\n    shared by two other nations: Italy and Japan.\r\n\r\n    “The period which lies behind us has indeed been put to good\r\n    use. All measures have been taken in the correct sequence and in\r\n    harmony with our aims.\r\n\r\n    “After 6 years, the situation is today as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The national-political unity of the Germans has been achieved,\r\n    apart from minor exceptions. Further successes cannot be\r\n    attained without the shedding of blood.\r\n\r\n    “The demarcation of frontiers is of military importance.\r\n\r\n    “The Pole is no ‘supplementary enemy’. Poland will always be on\r\n    the side of our adversaries. In spite of treaties of friendship,\r\n    Poland has always had the secret intention of exploiting every\r\n    opportunity to do us harm.\r\n\r\n    “Danzig is not the subject of the dispute at all. It is a\r\n    question of expanding our living space in the East and of\r\n    securing our food supplies, of the settlement of the Baltic\r\n    problem. Food supplies can be expected only from thinly\r\n    populated areas. Over and above the natural fertility,\r\n    thorough-going German exploitation will enormously increase the\r\n    surplus.\r\n\r\n    “There is no other possibility for Europe.\r\n\r\n    “Colonies: Beware of gifts of colonial territory. This does not\r\n    solve the food problem. Remember—blockade.\r\n\r\n    “If fate brings us into conflict with the West, the possession\r\n    of extensive areas in the East will be advantageous. Upon record\r\n    harvests we shall be able to rely even less in time of war than\r\n    in peace.\r\n\r\n    “The population of non-German areas will perform no military\r\n    service, and will be available as a source of labour.\r\n\r\n    “The Polish problem is inseparable from conflict with the West.\r\n\r\n    “Poland’s internal power of resistance to Bolshevism is\r\n    doubtful. Thus Poland is of doubtful value as a barrier against\r\n    Russia.\r\n\r\n    “It is questionable whether military success in the West can be\r\n    achieved by a quick decision, questionable too is the attitude\r\n    of Poland.\r\n\r\n    “The Polish government will not resist pressure from Russia.\r\n    Poland sees danger in a German victory in the West, and will\r\n    attempt to rob us of the victory.\r\n\r\n    “There is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and we are\r\n    left with the decision:\r\n\r\n    “_To attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity._ [This\r\n    sentence is underscored in the original German text.]\r\n\r\n    “We cannot expect a repetition of the Czech affair. There will\r\n    be war. Our task is to isolate Poland. The success of the\r\n    isolation will be decisive.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, the Fuehrer must reserve the right to give the final\r\n    order to attack. There must be no simultaneous conflict with the\r\n    Western Powers [France and England].\r\n\r\n    “If it is not certain that a German-Polish conflict will not\r\n    lead to war in the West, then the fight must be primarily\r\n    against England and France.\r\n\r\n    “Fundamentally therefore: Conflict with Poland—beginning with\r\n    an attack on Poland—will only be successful if the Western\r\n    Powers keep out of it. If this is impossible, then it will be\r\n    better to attack in the West and to settle Poland at the same\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    “The isolation of Poland is a matter of skillful politics.\r\n\r\n    “Japan is a weighty problem. Even if at first for various\r\n    reasons her collaboration with us appears to be somewhat cool\r\n    and restricted, it is nevertheless in Japan’s own interest to\r\n    take the initiative in attacking Russia in good time.\r\n\r\n    “Economic relations with Russia are possible only if political\r\n    relations have improved. A cautious trend is apparent in Press\r\n    comment. It is not impossible that Russia will show herself to\r\n    be disinterested in the destruction of Poland. Should Russia\r\n    take steps to oppose us, our relations with Japan may become\r\n    closer.\r\n\r\n    “If there were an alliance of France, England and Russia against\r\n    Germany, Italy and Japan, I would be constrained to attack\r\n    England and France with a few annihilating blows. The Fuehrer\r\n    doubts the possibility of a peaceful settlement with England. We\r\n    must prepare ourselves for the conflict. England sees in our\r\n    development the foundation of a hegemony which would weaken\r\n    England. England is therefore our enemy, and the conflict with\r\n    England will be a life-and-death struggle.\r\n\r\n    “_What will this struggle be like?_ [This sentence is\r\n    underscored in the German original.]\r\n\r\n    “England cannot deal with Germany and subjugate us with a few\r\n    powerful blows. It is imperative for England that the war should\r\n    be brought as near to the Ruhr basin as possible. French blood\r\n    will not be spared (West Wall). The possession of the Ruhr basin\r\n    will determine the duration of our resistance.\r\n\r\n    “The Dutch and Belgium air bases will be occupied by armed\r\n    forces. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored. If England\r\n    and France intend the war between Germany and Poland to lead to\r\n    a conflict, they will support Holland and Belgium in their\r\n    neutrality and make them build fortifications in order finally\r\n    to force them into cooperation.\r\n\r\n    “Albeit under protest, Belgium and Holland will yield to\r\n    pressure.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, if England intends to intervene in the Polish war,\r\n    we must occupy Holland with lightning speed. We must aim at\r\n    securing a new defense line on Dutch soil up to the Zuider Zee.\r\n\r\n    “The war with England and France will be a life-and-death\r\n    struggle.\r\n\r\n    “The idea that we can get off cheaply is dangerous; there is no\r\n    such possibility. We must burn our boats, and it is no longer a\r\n    question of justice or injustice, but of life or death for 80\r\n    million human beings.\r\n\r\n    “_Question: Short or long war?_\r\n\r\n    “Every country’s armed forces or government must aim at a short\r\n    war. The government, however, must also be prepared for a war of\r\n    10-15 years’ duration.\r\n\r\n    “History has always shown that the people have believed that\r\n    wars would be short. In 1914, the opinion still prevailed that\r\n    it was impossible to finance a long war. Even today this idea\r\n    still persists in many minds. But on the contrary, every state\r\n    will hold out as long as possible, unless it immediately suffers\r\n    some grave weakening (e.g. Ruhr basin). England has similar\r\n    weaknesses.\r\n\r\n    “England knows that to lose a war will mean the end of her world\r\n    power.\r\n\r\n    “_England_ is the driving force against Germany.\r\n\r\n    “Her strength lies in the following:\r\n\r\n    “1. The British themselves are proud, courageous, tenacious,\r\n    firm in resistance and gifted as organizers. They know how to\r\n    exploit every new development. They have the love of adventure\r\n    and bravery of the Nordic race. Quality is lowered by dispersal.\r\n    The German average is higher.\r\n\r\n    “2. World power in itself. It has been constant for 300 years.\r\n    Extended by the acquisition of allies, this power is not merely\r\n    something concrete, but must also be considered as a\r\n    psychological force embracing the entire world. Add to this\r\n    immeasurable wealth, with consequential financial credit.\r\n\r\n    “3. Geopolitical safety and protection by strong sea power and a\r\n    courageous air force.\r\n\r\n    “_England’s weakness_:\r\n\r\n    “If in the World War I we had had two battleships and two\r\n    cruisers more, and if the battle of Jutland had begun in the\r\n    morning, the British fleet would have been defeated and England\r\n    brought to her knees. It would have meant the end of this war.\r\n    It was formerly not sufficient to defeat the fleet. Landings had\r\n    to be made in order to defeat England. England could provide her\r\n    own food supplies. Today that is no longer possible.\r\n\r\n    “The moment England’s food supply routes are cut, she is forced\r\n    to capitulate. The import of food and fuel depends on the\r\n    fleet’s protection.\r\n\r\n    “If the German Air Force attacks English territory, England will\r\n    not be forced to capitulate in one day. But if the fleet is\r\n    destroyed immediate capitulation will be the result.\r\n\r\n    “There is no doubt that a surprise attack can lead to a quick\r\n    decision. It would be criminal, however, for the government to\r\n    rely entirely on the element of surprise.\r\n\r\n    “Experience has shown that surprise may be nullified by—\r\n\r\n    “1. Disclosure outside the limit of the military circles\r\n    concerned.\r\n\r\n    “2. Mere chance, which may cause the collapse of the whole\r\n    enterprise.\r\n\r\n    “3. Human failings.\r\n\r\n    “4. Weather conditions.\r\n\r\n    “The final date for striking must be fixed well in advance.\r\n    Beyond that time, the tension cannot be endured for long. It\r\n    must be borne in mind that weather conditions can render any\r\n    surprise intervention by Navy and Air Force impossible.\r\n\r\n    “This must be regarded as a most unfavorable basis of action.\r\n\r\n    “1. An effort must be made to deal the enemy a significant or\r\n    the final decisive blow right at the start. Consideration of\r\n    right and wrong or treaties do not enter into the matter. This\r\n    will only be possible if we are not involved in a war with\r\n    England on account of Poland.\r\n\r\n    “2. In addition to the surprise attack, preparation for a long\r\n    war must be made, while opportunities on the Continent for\r\n    England are eliminated.\r\n\r\n    “The Army will have to hold positions essential to the Navy and\r\n    Air Force. If Holland and Belgium are successfully occupied and\r\n    held, and if France is also defeated, the fundamental conditions\r\n    for a successful war against England will have been secured.\r\n\r\n    “England can then be blockaded from Western France at close\r\n    quarters by the Air Force, while the Navy with its submarines\r\n    extend the range of the blockade.\r\n\r\n    “_Consequences_:\r\n\r\n    “England will not be able to fight on the Continent:\r\n\r\n    “Daily attacks by the Air Force and Navy will cut all her\r\n    life-lines:\r\n\r\n    “Germany will not bleed to death on land.\r\n\r\n    “Such strategy has been shown to be necessary by World War I and\r\n    subsequent military operations. World War I is responsible for\r\n    the following strategic considerations which are imperative—\r\n\r\n    “1. With a more powerful Navy at the outbreak of the War, or a\r\n    wheeling movement by the Army towards the Channel ports, the end\r\n    would have been different.\r\n\r\n    “2. A country cannot be brought to defeat by an air force. It is\r\n    impossible to attack all objectives simultaneously, and the\r\n    lapse of time of a few minutes would evoke defense\r\n    counter-measures.\r\n\r\n    “3. The unrestricted use of all resources is essential.\r\n\r\n    “4. Once the Army, in cooperation with the Air Force and Navy,\r\n    has taken the most important positions, industrial production\r\n    will cease in flow in to the bottomless pit of the Army’s\r\n    battles, and can be diverted to benefit the Air Force and Navy.\r\n\r\n    “The Army must, therefore, be capable of taking these positions.\r\n    Systematic preparation must be made for the attack.\r\n\r\n    “Study to this end is of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n    “The aim will always be to force England to her knees.\r\n\r\n    “A weapon will only be of decisive importance in winning\r\n    battles, so long as the enemy does not possess it.\r\n\r\n    “This applies to gas, submarines and the Air Force. It would be\r\n    true of the latter, for instance, as long as the English Fleet\r\n    had no available countermeasures; it will no longer be the case\r\n    in 1940 and 1941. Against Poland, for example, tanks will be\r\n    effective, as the Polish Army possesses no counter-measures.\r\n\r\n    “Where straightforward pressure is no longer considered to be\r\n    decisive, its place must be taken by the elements of surprise\r\n    and by masterly handling. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Purpose:\r\n\r\n    “1. Study of the entire problem.\r\n\r\n    “2. Study of the events.\r\n\r\n    “3. Study of the means needed.\r\n\r\n    “4. Study of the necessary training.\r\n\r\n    “Men with great powers of imagination and high technical\r\n    training must belong to the staff, as well as officers with\r\n    sober sceptic powers of understanding.\r\n\r\n    “Working principles:\r\n\r\n    “1. No one is to take part in this who does not have to know of\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    “2. No one can find out more than he must know.\r\n\r\n    “3. When must the person in question know it at the very latest?\r\n    No one may know anything before it is necessary that he know it.\r\n\r\n    “On Goering’s question, the Fuehrer decided that:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ The armed forces determine what shall be built.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ In the shipbuilding program, nothing is to be changed.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ The armament programs are to be modeled on the years 1943\r\n    or 1944.\r\n\r\n    [Schmundt certified this text.]” (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nThese minutes demonstrate that the Nazi conspirators were proceeding in\r\naccordance with a plan. They demonstrate the cold-blooded premeditation\r\nof the assault on Poland. They demonstrate that the questions concerning\r\nDanzig, which the Nazis had agitated with Poland as a political pretext,\r\nwere not true questions, but were false issues, issues agitated to\r\nconceal their motive of aggressive, expansion for food, and\r\n_Lebensraum_.\r\n\r\nJust one week prior to the launching of the attack on Poland, Hitler\r\nmade an address to his chief military commanders, at Obersalzberg, on 22\r\nAugust 1939. [Three reports of this meeting are available: (_L-3_;\r\n_798-PS_; and _1014-PS_). The first of the three documents (_L-3_) was\r\nobtained through an American newspaperman, and purported to be original\r\nminutes of the Obersalzberg meeting, transmitted to the newspaperman by\r\nsome other person. There was no proof of actual delivery to the\r\nintermediary by the person who took the notes. That document (_L-3_)\r\ntherefore, merely served as an incentive to search for something better.\r\nThe result was that two other documents (_798-PS_) and (_1014-PS_) were\r\ndiscovered in the OKW files at Flensberg. These two documents indicate\r\nthat Hitler on that day made two speeches, one apparently in the morning\r\nand one in the afternoon. Comparison of those two documents with the\r\nfirst document (_L-3_) led to the conclusion that the first document was\r\na slightly garbled merger of the two speeches, and therefore was not\r\nrelied upon.]\r\n\r\nOn this day of 22 August 1939, Hitler addressed the supreme commanders\r\nof the three branches of the armed forces, as well as the commanding\r\ngenerals, (_Oberbefehlshabers_) as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I have called you together to give you a picture of the\r\n    political situation, in order that you may have insight into the\r\n    individual element on which I base my decision to act, and in\r\n    order to strengthen your confidence. After this, we will discuss\r\n    military details.\r\n\r\n    “It was clear to me that a conflict with Poland had to come\r\n    sooner or later. I had already made this decision in Spring.\r\n    [Apparently this referred to (_L-79_).] But I thought I would\r\n    first turn against the West in a few years, and only afterwards\r\n    against the East. But the sequence cannot be fixed. One cannot\r\n    close one’s eyes even before a threatening situation. I wanted\r\n    to establish an acceptable relationship with Poland, in order to\r\n    fight first against the West, but this plan which was agreeable\r\n    to me could not be executed, since essential points have\r\n    changed.\r\n\r\n    “It became clear to me that Poland would attack us, in case of a\r\n    conflict in the West.\r\n\r\n    “Poland wants access to the sea.\r\n\r\n    “The further development became obvious after the occupation of\r\n    the Memel region, and it became clear to me that under the\r\n    circumstances a conflict with Poland could arise at an\r\n    unopportune moment.\r\n\r\n    “I enumerate as reasons for this reflection, first of all, two\r\n    personal constitutions, my own personality, and that of\r\n    Mussolini. Essentially, it depends on me, my existence, because\r\n    of my political activity.\r\n\r\n    “Furthermore, the fact that probably no one will ever again have\r\n    the confidence of the whole German people as I do. There will\r\n    probably never again be a man in the future with more authority.\r\n    My existence is, therefore, a factor of great value. But I can\r\n    be eliminated at any time by a criminal or an idiot.\r\n\r\n    “The second personal factor is Il Duce. His existence is also\r\n    decisive. If something happens to him, Italy’s loyalty to the\r\n    alliance will no longer be certain. The basic attitude of the\r\n    Italian Court is against the Duce. Above all, the Court sees in\r\n    the expansion of the empire a burden. The Duce is the man with\r\n    the strongest nerves in Italy.\r\n\r\n    “The third factor, favorable for us is Franco. We can only ask\r\n    benevolent neutrality from Spain, but this depends on Franco’s\r\n    personality. He guarantees a certain uniformity and steadiness\r\n    of the present system in Spain. We must take into account the\r\n    fact that Spain does not as yet have a Fascist Party of our\r\n    internal unity.\r\n\r\n    “On the other side, a negative picture, as far as decisive\r\n    personalities are concerned. There is no outstanding personality\r\n    in England or France.\r\n\r\n    “For us it is easy to make decisions. We have nothing to lose:\r\n    we can only gain. Our economic situation is such, because of our\r\n    restrictions, that we cannot hold out more than a few years.\r\n    Goering can confirm this. We have no other choice; we must act.\r\n    Our opponents risk much and gain only little. England’s stake in\r\n    a war is unimaginably great. Our enemies have men who are below\r\n    average. No personalities, no masters, no men of action.\r\n\r\n    “Besides the personal factor, the political situation is\r\n    favorable for us; in the Mediterranean rivalry among Italy,\r\n    France, and England; in the Orient tension, which leads to the\r\n    alarming of the Mohammedan world.\r\n\r\n    “The English empire did not emerge from the last war\r\n    strengthened. From a maritime point of view, nothing was\r\n    achieved: Conflict between England and Ireland, the south\r\n    African Union became more independent, concessions had to be\r\n    made to India, England is in great danger, unhealthy industries.\r\n    A British statesman can look into the future only with concern.\r\n\r\n    “France’s position has also deteriorated, particularly in the\r\n    Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n    “Further favorable factors for us are these:\r\n\r\n    “Since Albania, there is an equilibrium of power in the Balkans.\r\n    Yugoslavia carries the germ of collapse because of her internal\r\n    situation.\r\n\r\n    “Rumania did not grow stronger. She is liable to attack and\r\n    vulnerable. She is threatened by Hungary and Bulgaria. Since\r\n    Kemal’s death, Turkey has been ruled by small minds, unsteady\r\n    weak men.\r\n\r\n    “All these fortunate circumstances will no longer prevail in two\r\n    to three years. No one knows how long I shall live. Therefore\r\n    conflict better now.\r\n\r\n    “The creation of Greater Germany was a great achievement\r\n    politically but militarily it was questionable, since it was\r\n    achieved through a bluff of the political leaders. It is\r\n    necessary to test the military, if at all possible, not by\r\n    general settlement, but by solving individual tasks.\r\n\r\n    “The relation to Poland has become unbearable. My Polish policy\r\n    hitherto was in contrast to the ideas of the people. My\r\n    propositions to Poland, the Danzig corridor, were disturbed by\r\n    England’s intervention. Poland changed her tune towards us. The\r\n    initiative cannot be allowed to pass to others. This moment is\r\n    more favorable than in two to three years. An attempt on my life\r\n    or Mussolini’s could only change the situation to our\r\n    disadvantage. One cannot eternally stand opposite one another\r\n    with cocked rifle. A suggested compromise would have demanded\r\n    that we change our convictions and make agreeable gestures. They\r\n    talked to us again in the language of Versailles. There was\r\n    danger of losing prestige. Now the probability is still great\r\n    that the West will not interfere. We must accept the risk with\r\n    reckless resolution. A politician must accept a risk as much as\r\n    a military leader. We are facing the alternative to strike or to\r\n    be destroyed with certainty sooner or later.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Now it is also a great risk. Iron nerves, iron resolution.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “We need not be afraid of a blockade. The East will supply us\r\n    with grain, cattle, coal, lead and zinc. It is a big arm, which\r\n    demands great efforts. I am only afraid that at the last minute\r\n    some _Schweinhund_ will make a proposal for mediation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Goering answers with thanks to the Fuehrer and the assurance\r\n    that the armed forces will do their duty.” (_798-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn his second speech on 22 August 1939 the Fuehrer had this to say:\r\n\r\n    “It may also turn out differently regarding England and France.\r\n    One cannot predict it with certainty. I figure on a\r\n    trade-barrier, not on blockade, and with severance of relations.\r\n    Most iron determination on our side. Retreat before nothing.\r\n    Everybody shall have to make a point of it that we were\r\n    determined from the beginning to fight the Western powers.\r\n    Struggle for life or death. Germany has won every war as long as\r\n    she was united. Iron, unflinching attitude of all superiors,\r\n    greatest confidence, faith in victory, overcoming of the past by\r\n    getting used to heaviest strain. A long period of peace would\r\n    not do us any good. Therefore it is necessary to expect\r\n    everything. Manly bearing. It is not machines that fight each\r\n    other, but men. We have the better quality of men. Mental\r\n    factors are decisive. The opposite camp has weaker people. In\r\n    1918, the Nation fell down because the mental prerequisites were\r\n    not sufficient. Frederic the Great secured final success only\r\n    through his mental power.\r\n\r\n    “Destruction of Poland in the foreground. The aim is elimination\r\n    of living forces, not the arrival at a certain line. Even if war\r\n    should break out in the West, the destruction of Poland shall be\r\n    the primary objective. Quick decision because of the season.\r\n\r\n    “I shall give a propagandistic cause for starting the war, never\r\n    mind whether it be plausible or not. The victor shall not be\r\n    asked, later on, whether we told the truth or not. In starting\r\n    and making a war, not the Right is what matters but Victory.\r\n\r\n    “Have no pity. Brutal attitude. 80,000,000 people shall get what\r\n    is their right. Their existence has to be secured. The strongest\r\n    has the Right. Greatest severity.\r\n\r\n    “Quick decision necessary. Unshakable faith in the German\r\n    soldier. A crisis may happen only if the nerves of the leaders\r\n    give way.\r\n\r\n    “First aim: advance to the Vistula and Narew. Our technical\r\n    superiority will break the nerves of the Poles. Every\r\n    newly-created Polish force shall again be broken at once.\r\n    Constant war of attrition.\r\n\r\n    “New German frontier according to healthy principle. Possibly a\r\n    protectorate as a buffer. Military operations shall not be\r\n    influenced by these reflections. Complete destruction of Poland\r\n    is the military aim. To be fast is the main thing. Pursuit until\r\n    complete elimination.\r\n\r\n    “Conviction that the German _Wehrmacht_ is up to the\r\n    requirements. The start shall be ordered, probably by Saturday\r\n    morning.” (_1014-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _Expansion into General War of Aggression: Scandinavia, The Low\r\nCountries, The Balkans._\r\n\r\nThe aggressive war having been initiated in September 1939, and Poland\r\nhaving been defeated shortly after the initial assaults, the Nazi\r\naggressors converted the war into a general war of aggression extending\r\ninto Scandinavia, into the Low Countries, and into the Balkans. (Under\r\nthe division of the case agreed by the four Chief Prosecutors, this\r\nphase of aggression was left for development to the British prosecuting\r\nstaff, and is discussed in Sections 9, 10 and 11 of this Chapter,\r\n_infra_.)\r\n\r\nE. _Aggression Against the U. S. S. R._\r\n\r\nThe attack upon Russia was preceded with premeditation and deliberation.\r\nJust as, in the case of aggression against Czechoslovakia, the Nazis had\r\na code name for the secret operation, “Case Green”, so in the case of\r\naggression against the Soviet Union, they had a code name, “Case\r\nBarbarossa”. A secret directive, Number 21, issued from the Fuehrer’s\r\nHeadquarters on 18 December 1940, relating to “Case Barbarossa,” was\r\ncaptured among the OKW files at Flensberg (_446-PS_). This directive was\r\nissued more than six months in advance of the attack. (Other evidence\r\nshows that the planning occurred even earlier.) This order, signed by\r\nHitler and initialled by Jodl and Keitel, was issued in nine copies, of\r\nwhich we have the fourth. The directive reads:\r\n\r\n    “The German Armed Forces must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia\r\n    in a quick campaign before the end of the war against England.\r\n    (Case Barbarossa.)\r\n\r\n    “For this purpose the Army will have to employ all available\r\n    units with the reservation that the occupied territories will\r\n    have to be safeguarded against surprise attacks.\r\n\r\n    “For the Eastern campaign the Air force will have to free such\r\n    strong forces for the support of the Army that a quick\r\n    completion of the ground operations may be expected and that\r\n    damage of the Eastern German territories will be avoided as much\r\n    as possible. This concentration of the main effort in the East\r\n    is limited by the following reservation: That the entire battle\r\n    and armament area dominated by us must remain sufficiently\r\n    protected against enemy air attacks and that the attacks on\r\n    England and especially the supply for them must not be permitted\r\n    to break down.\r\n\r\n    “Concentration of the main effort of the Navy remains\r\n    unequivocally against England also during an Eastern campaign.\r\n\r\n    “If occasion arises I will order the concentration of troops for\r\n    action against Soviet Russia eight weeks before the intended\r\n    beginning of operations.\r\n\r\n    “Preparations requiring more time to start are—if this has not\r\n    yet been done—to begin presently and are to be completed by 15\r\n    May 1941.\r\n\r\n    “Great caution has to be exercised that the intention of an\r\n    attack will not be recognized.\r\n\r\n    “The preparations of the High Command are to be made on the\r\n    following basis:\r\n\r\n    “I. _General Purpose_:\r\n\r\n    “The mass of the Russian Army in Western Russia is to be\r\n    destroyed in daring operations by driving forward deep wedges\r\n    with tanks and the retreat of intact battle-ready troops into\r\n    the wide spaces of Russia is to be prevented.\r\n\r\n    “In quick pursuit a (given) line is to be reached from where the\r\n    Russian Air force will no longer be able to attack German Reich\r\n    territory. The first goal of operations is the protection from\r\n    Asiatic Russian from the general line Volga-Archangelsk. In case\r\n    of necessity, the last industrial area in the Urals left to\r\n    Russia could be eliminated by the Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\n    In the course of these operations the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet\r\n    will quickly erase its bases and will no longer be ready to\r\n    fight.\r\n\r\n    “Effective intervention by the Russian Air force is to be\r\n    prevented through forceful blows at the beginning of the\r\n    operations.” (_446-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother secret document captured from the OKW files establishes the\r\nmotive for the attack on the Soviet Union (_2718-PS_). It also\r\nestablishes the full awareness of the Nazi conspirators of the Crimes\r\nagainst Humanity which would result from their attack. The document is a\r\nmemorandum of 2 May 1941 concerning the results of a discussion on that\r\nday with the State Secretaries concerning “Case Barbarossa.” The\r\nmemorandum reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “Matter for Chief; 2 copies; first copy to files Ia. Second copy\r\n    to General Schubert. May 2nd, 1941. Memorandum. About the result\r\n    of today’s discussion with the State Secretaries about\r\n    Barbarossa.\r\n\r\n    “1. The war can only be continued if all armed forces are fed by\r\n    Russia in the third year of war.\r\n\r\n    “2. There is no doubt that as a result many millions of people\r\n    will be starved to death if we take out of the country the\r\n    things necessary for us.” (_2718-PS_)\r\n\r\nF. _Collaboration with Japan: Precipitation Of The Pearl Harbor Attack._\r\n\r\nWith the unleashing of the German aggressive war against the Soviet\r\nUnion in June 1941, the Nazi conspirators and, in particular Ribbentrop,\r\ncalled upon the Eastern co-architect of the New Order, Japan, to attack\r\nin the rear. The Nazi’s incited and kept in motion a force reasonably\r\ncalculated to result in an attack on the United States. For a time, they\r\npreferred that the United States not be involved in the conflict, due to\r\nmilitary considerations. However, their incitement resulted in the\r\nattack on Pearl Harbor, and long prior to that attack, they had assured\r\nthe Japanese that they would declare War on the United States should a\r\nUnited States-Japanese conflict occur. It was in reliance on these\r\nassurances that the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor.\r\n\r\nThese matters are disclosed in a document, captured from the files of\r\nthe German Foreign Office, which consists of notes dated 4 April 1941,\r\nsigned by Schmidt, regarding discussions between the Fuehrer and the\r\nJapanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, in the presence of Ribbentrop\r\n(_1881-PS_). Pertinent parts of this document read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka then also expressed the request, that the Fuehrer\r\n    should instruct the proper authorities in Germany to meet as\r\n    broad-mindedly as possible the wishes of the Japanese Military\r\n    Commission. Japan was in need of German help particularly\r\n    concerning the U-boat warfare, which could be given by making\r\n    available to them the latest experiences of the war as well as\r\n    the latest technical improvements and inventions. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Japan would do her utmost to avoid a war with the United\r\n    States. In case that the country should decide to attack\r\n    Singapore, the Japanese navy, of course, had to be prepared for\r\n    a fight with the United States, because in that case America\r\n    would probably side with Great Britain. He (Matsuoka) personally\r\n    believed, that the United States could be restrained by\r\n    diplomatic exertions from entering the war at the side of Great\r\n    Britain. Army and Navy had, however, to count on the worse\r\n    situation, that is war against America. They were of the opinion\r\n    that such a war would extend for five years or longer and would\r\n    take the form of guerilla warfare in the Pacific and would be\r\n    fought out in the South Sea. For this reason the German\r\n    experiences in her guerilla warfare are of the greatest value to\r\n    Japan. It was a question how such a war would best be conducted\r\n    and how all the technical improvements of submarine, in all\r\n    details such as periscopes and such like, could best be\r\n    exploited by Japan. “To sum up, Matsuoka requested that the\r\n    Fuehrer should see to it that the proper German authorities\r\n    would place at the disposal of the Japanese these developments\r\n    and inventions concerning navy and army, which were needed by\r\n    the Japanese.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer promised this and pointed out that Germany too\r\n    considered a conflict with the United States undesirable, but\r\n    that it had already made allowance for such a contingency. In\r\n    Germany one was of the opinion that America’s contribution\r\n    depended upon the possibilities of transportation, and that this\r\n    again is conditioned by the available tonnage. Germany’s war\r\n    against tonnage, however, means a decisive weakening not merely\r\n    against England, but also against America. Germany has made her\r\n    preparations so that no American could land in Europe. She would\r\n    conduct a most energetic fight against America with her U-boats\r\n    and her Luftwaffe, and due to her superior experience, which\r\n    would still have to be acquired by the United States, she would\r\n    be vastly superior, and that quite apart from the fact, that the\r\n    German soldier naturally ranks high above the American.\r\n\r\n    “In the further course of the discussion the Fuehrer pointed\r\n    out, that Germany on her part would immediately take the\r\n    consequences, if Japan would get involved with the United\r\n    States. It did not matter with whom the United States would\r\n    first get involved, if with Germany or with Japan. They would\r\n    always try to eliminate one country at a time, not to come to an\r\n    understanding with the other country subsequently. Therefore\r\n    Germany would strike, as already mentioned, without delay in\r\n    case of a conflict between Japan and America, because the\r\n    strength of the tripartite powers lies in their joined action,\r\n    their weakness would be if they would let themselves be beaten\r\n    individually.\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka once more repeated his request, that the Fuehrer might\r\n    give the necessary instructions, in order that the proper German\r\n    authorities would place at the disposal of the Japanese the\r\n    latest improvements and inventions, which are of interest to\r\n    them. Because the Japanese navy had to prepare immediately for a\r\n    conflict with the United States.\r\n\r\n    “As regards Japanese-American relationship, Matsuoka explained\r\n    further that he has always declared in his country, that sooner\r\n    or later a war with the United States would be unavoidable, if\r\n    Japan continued to drift along as at present. In his opinion\r\n    this conflict would happen rather sooner than later. His\r\n    argumentation went on, why should Japan, therefore, not\r\n    decisively strike at the right moment and take the risk upon\r\n    herself of a fight against America? Just thus would she perhaps\r\n    avoid a war for generations, particularly if she gained\r\n    predominance in the South Seas. There are, to be sure, in Japan\r\n    many who hesitate to follow those trends of thought. Matsuoka\r\n    was considered in those circles a dangerous man with dangerous\r\n    thoughts. He, however, stated that, if Japan continued to walk\r\n    along her present path, one day she would have to fight anyway\r\n    and that this would then be under less favorable circumstances\r\n    than at present.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer replied that he could well understand the situation\r\n    of Matsuoka, because he himself was in similar situations (the\r\n    clearing of the Rhineland, declaration of sovereignty of armed\r\n    Forces). He too was of the opinion that he had to exploit\r\n    favorable conditions and accept the risk of an anyhow\r\n    unavoidable fight at a time when he himself was still young and\r\n    full of vigor. How right he was in his attitude was proven by\r\n    events. Europe now was free. He would not hesitate a moment\r\n    instantly to reply to any widening of the war, be it by Russia,\r\n    be it by America. Providence favored those who will not let\r\n    dangers come to them, but who will bravely face them.\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka replied, that the United States or rather their ruling\r\n    politicians had recently still attempted a last manoeuver\r\n    towards Japan, by declaring that America would not fight Japan\r\n    on account of China or the South Seas provided that Japan gave\r\n    free passage to the consignment of rubber and tin to America to\r\n    their place of destination. However, America would war against\r\n    Japan the moment she felt that Japan entered the war with the\r\n    intention to assist in the destruction of Great Britain. * * *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer commented on this, that this attitude of America\r\n    did not mean anything but that the United States had the hope,\r\n    that, as long as the British World Empire existed, one day they\r\n    could advance against Japan together with Great Britain,\r\n    whereas, in case of the collapse of the World Empire, they would\r\n    be totally isolated and could not do anything against Japan.\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Foreign Minister interjected that the Americans\r\n    precisely under all circumstances wanted to maintain the\r\n    powerful position of England in East Asia, but that on the other\r\n    hand it is proved by this attitude, to what extent she fears a\r\n    joint action of Japan and Germany.\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka continued that it seemed to him of importance to give\r\n    to the Fuehrer an absolutely clear picture of the real attitude\r\n    inside Japan. For this reason he also had to inform him\r\n    regretfully of the fact that he (Matsuoka) in his capacity as\r\n    Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs could not utter in Japan\r\n    itself a single word of all that he had expounded before the\r\n    Fuehrer and the Reich Foreign Minister regarding his plans. This\r\n    would cause him serious damage in political and financial\r\n    circles. Once before, he had committed the mistake, before he\r\n    became Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, to tell a close\r\n    friend something about his intentions. It seems that the latter\r\n    had spread these things and thus brought about all sorts of\r\n    rumors, which he as Foreign Minister had to oppose\r\n    energetically, though as a rule he always tells the truth. Under\r\n    those circumstances he also could not indicate, how soon he\r\n    could report on the questions discussed to the Japanese Premier\r\n    or to the Emperor. He would have to study exactly and carefully\r\n    in the first place the development in Japan, so as to make his\r\n    decision at a favorable moment, to make a clean breast of his\r\n    proper plans towards the Prince Konoye and the Emperor. Then the\r\n    decision would have to be made within a few days, because the\r\n    plans would otherwise be spoiled by talk.\r\n\r\n    “Should he, Matsuoka, fail to carry out his intentions, that\r\n    would be proof that he is lacking in influence, in power of\r\n    conviction, and in tactical capabilities. However, should he\r\n    succeed, it would prove that he had great influence in Japan. He\r\n    himself felt confident that he would succeed.\r\n\r\n    “On his return, being questioned, he would indeed admit to the\r\n    Emperor, the Premier and the Ministers for the Navy and the\r\n    Army, that Singapore had been discussed; he would, however,\r\n    state that it was only on a hypothetical basis.\r\n\r\n    “Besides this Matsuoka made the express request not to cable in\r\n    the matter of Singapore because he had reason to fear that by\r\n    cabling something might leak out. If necessary he would send a\r\n    courier.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer agreed and assured after all, that he could rest\r\n    entirely assured of German reticence.\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka replied he believed indeed in German reticence, but\r\n    unfortunately could not say the same of Japan.\r\n\r\n    “The discussion was terminated after the exchange of some\r\n    personal parting words.\r\n\r\n    “Berlin, the 4th of April 1941.\r\n\r\n    “(signed)  SCHMIDT”  (_1881-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE PLOTTING OF\r\n                             AGGRESSIVE WAR\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Section IV (F);  │      │\r\n                │  V.                                    │  I   │  22, 29\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

At that time its plans called for the acquisition of\r\npolitical control of Germany. This was indispensable for consolidation,\r\nwithin the country, of all the internal resources and potentialities.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there was sufficient progress along this line of internal\r\nconsolidation, the next step was to become disengaged from some of the\r\nexternal disadvantages of existing international limitations and\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nThe restrictions of the Versailles Treaty were a bar to the development\r\nof strength in all the fields necessary if Germany were to make war.\r\nAlthough there had been an increasing amount of circumvention and\r\nviolation from the very time that the Versailles Treaty came into\r\neffect, such operations under disguise and subterfuge could not attain\r\nproportions adequate for the objectives of the Nazis. To get the Treaty\r\nof Versailles out of the way was indispensable to the development of the\r\nextensive military power which they had to have for their purposes. It\r\nwas as a part of the same plan and for the same reason that Germany\r\nwithdrew from the Disarmament Conference and from the League of Nations.\r\nIt was impossible for the Nazis to carry out their plan on the basis of\r\nexisting international obligations or on the basis of the orthodox kind\r\nof future commitments.\r\n\r\nEvery military and diplomatic operation undertaken by the Nazis was\r\npreceded by a plan of action and a careful coordination of all\r\nparticipating forces. At the same time each event was part of a long\r\nprepared plan of aggression. Each represented a necessary step in the\r\npreparation of the schedule of aggressions which was subsequently\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThree of the steps in preparation for aggression were first, the\r\nwithdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations;\r\nsecond, the institution of compulsory military service; and, third, the\r\nreoccupation of the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. Each of these\r\nsteps was progressively more serious in the matter of international\r\nrelations. In each of these steps Germany anticipated the possibility of\r\nsanctions being applied by other countries, and, particularly, a strong\r\nmilitary action from France with the possible assistance of England.\r\nHowever, the conspirators were determined that nothing less than a\r\npreventive war would stop them, and they also estimated correctly that\r\nno one or combination of big powers would undertake the responsibility\r\nfor such a war. The withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and from\r\nthe League of Nations was, of course, action that did not violate any\r\ninternational obligation. The League Covenant provided the procedure for\r\nwithdrawal. These actions, however, cannot be disassociated from the\r\ngeneral conspiracy and the plan for aggression. The announcement of the\r\ninstitution of universal military service was a more daring action. It\r\nwas a violation of the Versailles Treaty, but the Nazis got away with\r\nit. Then came outright military defiance, with the occupation of the\r\ndemilitarized zone of the Rhineland.\r\n\r\nA. _Planning to Overthrow the Versailles Treaty._\r\n\r\nThe determination and the plans of the Nazi conspirators to remove the\r\nrestrictions of Versailles, started very early. This fact is confirmed\r\nby their own statements, their boasts of long planning and careful\r\nexecution. Hitler, in his speech to all Supreme Commanders on 23\r\nNovember 1939, stated that his primary goal was to wipe out Versailles\r\n(_789-PS_). And Jodl, as Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces,\r\ndelivered an address after four years of war, on 7 November 1943, in\r\nwhich he traced the development of German strength (_L-172_). The\r\nseizure of power to him meant the restoration of fighting sovereignty,\r\nincluding conscription, occupation of the Rhineland, and rearmament,\r\nwith special emphasis on modern armor and air forces. In his speech,\r\nentitled “The Strategic Position at the Beginning of the 5th Year of\r\nWar,” General Jodl gave a retrospective summary of the war for the\r\nbenefit of the Reich and Gau leaders. He stated:\r\n\r\n    “Introduction: Reichsleiter Bormann has requested me to give you\r\n    a review today of the strategic position in the beginning of the\r\n    5th Year of War.\r\n\r\n    “I must admit that it was not without hesitation that I\r\n    undertook this none too easy task. It is not possible to do it\r\n    justice with a few generalities. It is not necessary to say\r\n    openly what is. No one—the Fuehrer has ordered—may know more\r\n    or be told more than he needs for his own immediate task, but I\r\n    have no doubt at all in my mind, Gentlemen, but that you need a\r\n    great deal in order to be able to cope with your tasks. It is in\r\n    your Gaus, after all, and among their inhabitants that all the\r\n    enemy propaganda, the defeatism, and the malicious rumours\r\n    concentrate, that try to find themselves a plan among our\r\n    people. Up and down the country the devil of subversion strides.\r\n    All the cowards are seeking a way out, or—as they call it—a\r\n    political solution. They say, we must negotiate while there is\r\n    still something in hand, and all these slogans are made use of\r\n    to attack the natural sense of the people, that in this war\r\n    there can only be a fight to the end. Capitulation is the end of\r\n    the Nation, the end of Germany. Against this wave of enemy\r\n    propaganda and cowardice you need more than force. You need to\r\n    know the true situation and for this reason I believe that I am\r\n    justified in giving you a perfectly open and uncolored account\r\n    of the state of affairs. This is no forbidden disclosure of\r\n    secrets, but a weapon which may perhaps help you to fortify the\r\n    morale of the people. For this war will not only be decided by\r\n    the force of arms but by the will of the whole people. Germany\r\n    was broken in 1918 not at the front but at home. Italy suffered\r\n    not military defeat but morale defeat. She broke down\r\n    internally. The result has been not the peace she expected\r\n    but—through the cowardice of these criminal traitors—a fate\r\n    thousand times harder than continuation of the war at our side\r\n    would have brought to the Italian people. I can rely on you,\r\n    Gentlemen, that since I give concrete figures and data\r\n    concerning our own strength, you will treat these details as\r\n    your secret; all the rest is at your disposal without\r\n    restriction for application in your activities as leaders of the\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n    “The necessity and objectives of this war were clear to all and\r\n    everyone at the moment when we entered upon the War of\r\n    Liberation of Greater Germany and by attacking parried the\r\n    danger which menaced us both from Poland and from the Western\r\n    powers. Our further incursions into Scandinavia, in the\r\n    direction of the Mediterranean, and in that of Russia—these\r\n    also aroused no doubts concerning the general conduct of the war\r\n    so long as we were successful. It was not until more serious\r\n    set-backs were encountered and our general situation began to\r\n    become increasingly acute, that the German people began to ask\r\n    itself whether perhaps we had not undertaken more than we could\r\n    do and set our aims too high. To provide an answer to this\r\n    questioning and to furnish you with certain points of view for\r\n    use in your own explanatory activities is one of the main points\r\n    of my present lecture; I shall divide it into three parts:\r\n\r\n        “I. A review of the most important development up to the\r\n        present.\r\n\r\n        “II. Consideration of the present situation.\r\n\r\n        “III. The foundation of our morale and our confidence in\r\n        victory.\r\n\r\n    “In view of my position as military advisor to the Fuehrer, I\r\n    shall confine myself in my remarks to the problems of my own\r\n    personal sphere of action, fully appreciating at the same time\r\n    that in view of the protean nature of this war, I shall in this\r\n    way be giving expression only to one side of events.\r\n\r\n                              “I. _Review_\r\n\r\n    “1. The fact that the National Socialist movement and its\r\n    struggle for internal power were the preparatory stage of the\r\n    outer liberation from the bonds of the Dictate of Versailles is\r\n    not one on which I need enlarge in this circle. I should like\r\n    however to mention at this point how clearly all thoughtful\r\n    regular soldiers realize what an important part has been played\r\n    by the National Socialist movement in reawakening the will to\r\n    fight [_Wehrwillen_] in nurturing fighting strength\r\n    [_Wehrkraft_] and in rearming the German people. In spite of all\r\n    the virtue inherent in it, the numerically small _Reichswehr_\r\n    would never have been able to cope with this task, if only\r\n    because of its own restricted radius of action. Indeed, what the\r\n    Fuehrer aimed at—and has so happily been successful in bringing\r\n    about—was the fusion of these two forces.\r\n\r\n    “2. The seizure of power in its turn has meant in the first\r\n    place restoration of fighting sovereignty\r\n    [_Wehrhoheit_—conscription, occupation of the Rhineland] and\r\n    rearmament with special emphasis being laid on the creation of a\r\n    modern armoured and air arm.\r\n\r\n    “3. The Austrian ‘_Anschlluss_’ in its turn, brought with it not\r\n    only the fulfillment of an old national aim but also had the\r\n    effect both of reinforcing our fighting strength and of\r\n    materially improving our strategic position. Whereas up till\r\n    then the territory of Czechoslovakia had projected in a most\r\n    menacing way right into Germany (a wasp waist in the direction\r\n    of France and an air base for the Allies, in particular Russia),\r\n    Czechoslovakia herself was now enclosed by pincers.\r\n\r\n    “Its own strategic position had now become so unfavorable that\r\n    she was bound to fall a victim to any attack pressed home with\r\n    rigour before effective aid from the West could be expected to\r\n    arrive.\r\n\r\n    “This possibility of aid was furthermore made more difficult by\r\n    the construction of the West Wall, which, in contra-distinction\r\n    to the Maginot Line, was not a measure based on debility and\r\n    resignation but one intended to afford rear cover for an active\r\n    policy in the East.\r\n\r\n    “4. The bloodless solution of the Czech conflict in the autumn\r\n    of 1938 and spring of 1939 and the annexation of Slovakia\r\n    rounded off the territory of Greater Germany in such a way that\r\n    it now became possible to consider the Polish problem on the\r\n    basis of more or less favourable strategic premises.\r\n\r\n    “This brings me to the actual outbreak of the present war, and\r\n    the question which next arises is whether the moment for the\r\n    struggle with Poland—in itself unavoidable—was favorably\r\n    selected or not. The answer to this question is all the less in\r\n    doubt since the opponent—after all, not inconsiderable in\r\n    himself—collapsed unexpectedly quickly, and the Western Powers\r\n    who were his friends, while they did declare war on us and form\r\n    a second front, yet for the rest made no use of the\r\n    possibilities open to them of snatching the initiative from our\r\n    hands. Concerning the course of the Polish campaign, nothing\r\n    further need be said beyond that it proved in a measure which\r\n    made the whole world sit up and take notice a point which up\r\n    till then had not been certain by any means; that is, the high\r\n    state of efficiency of the young Armed Forces of Great Germany.”\r\n    (_L-172_)\r\n\r\nIn this speech General Jodl identifies himself fully with the Nazi\r\nmovement. His own words show that he was not a mere soldier. Insofar as\r\nhe is concerned, his speech identifies the military with the political,\r\nit also shows the deliberation with which the Treaty of Versailles was\r\nabrogated by Germany and the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland was\r\nmilitarized and fortified.\r\n\r\nIn one of Adolf Hitler’s reviews of the six-year period between his\r\nascendancy to power and the outbreak of hostilities, he not only\r\nadmitted but boasted about the orderly and coordinated long-range\r\nplanning. The minutes of conference of the Fuehrer kept by Schmundt, his\r\nadjutant, contain the following passage:\r\n\r\n    “In the period 1933-1939 progress was made in all fields. Our\r\n    military system improved enormously.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The period which lies behind us has, indeed, been put to good\r\n    use. All measures have been taken in the correct sequence and in\r\n    harmony with our aims.” (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nB. _Economic and Financial Preparations for Aggressive War._\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant preparations for aggressive war is found in\r\nthe Secret Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935 (_2261-PS_). The law went\r\ninto effect upon its passage. It stated at its outset that it was to be\r\nmade public instanter, but at the end of it Adolf Hitler signed the\r\ndecree ordering that it be kept secret. General Thomas, who was in\r\ncharge of War Armament Economy and for some time a high-ranking member\r\nof the German High Command, refers, to this law as the cornerstone of\r\nwar preparations. He points out that, although the law was not made\r\npublic until the outbreak of war, it was put into immediate execution as\r\na program for preparations. These statements are made at page 25 of\r\nGeneral Thomas’ work, “A History of the German War and Armament Economy,\r\n1923-1944.” (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis secret law remained in effect until 4 September 1939, at which time\r\nit was replaced by another secret defense law (_2194-PS_) revising the\r\nsystem of defense organization and directing more detailed preparations\r\nfor the approaching status of “mobilization,” which was clearly an\r\neuphemism for war.\r\n\r\nThe covering letter, under which this second Reich Defense Law, was sent\r\nto the Ministry for Economy and Labor for Saxony in Dresden, on 6\r\nDecember 1939, was classified Top Secret and read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Transportation Section, attention of Construction Chief\r\n    Counsellor Hirches, or representative in the office of the Reich\r\n    Protector in Bohemia and Moravia, received Prague, 5 September\r\n    1939, No. 274.\r\n\r\n    “Inclosed please find a copy of the Reich Defense Law of 4\r\n    September 1938 and a copy each of the decrees of the Reich\r\n    Minister of Transportation, dated 7 October 1938, RL 10.2212/38,\r\n    top secret, and of 17 July 1939, RL/LV 1.2173/39, top secret.\r\n    For your information and observance, by order, signed\r\n    Kretzchmar. 3 inclosures completed to Dresden, 4 September 1939,\r\n    signed Schneider 3 inclosures. Receipt for the letter of 4\r\n    September 1939, with 3 inclosures, signed 5 September, 1939, and\r\n    returned to construction Counsellor Kretzchmar.” (_2194-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus the second secret Reich Defense Law was transmitted under top\r\nsecret cover.\r\n\r\nThe general plan for the breach of the Treaty of Versailles and for the\r\nensuing aggressions was carried out in four ways: (1) secret rearmament\r\nfrom 1933 to March 1935; (2) the training of military personnel (that\r\nincludes secret or camouflage training); (3) production of munitions of\r\nwar; (4) the building of an air force.\r\n\r\nThe facts of rearmament and of secrecy are self-evident from the events\r\nthat followed. The significant phase of this activity lies in the fact\r\nthat it was necessary in order to break the barriers of the Treaty of\r\nVersailles and of the Locarno Pact, and to make ready for aggressive\r\nwars which were to follow.\r\n\r\nThose activities by their nature and extent, could only have been for\r\naggressive purposes. The highest importance which the German government\r\nattached to the secrecy of the program is emphasized by the disguised\r\nmethods of financing utilized both before and after the announcement of\r\nconscription, and the rebuilding of the army, on 16 March 1935.\r\n\r\nThe point is illustrated by an unsigned memorandum by Schacht dated 3\r\nMay 1935, entitled, “The Financing of the Armament program,\r\n“_Finanzierung der Ruestung_.” (1168-PS) It is not signed by Schacht,\r\nbut in an interrogation on 16 October 1945, he identified it as being\r\nhis memorandum. The memorandum reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Memorandum from Schacht to Hitler [identified by Schacht as\r\n    Exhibit A, interrogation 16 October 1945, page 40] May 3, 1935.\r\n\r\n    “Financing of Armament. The following explanations are based\r\n    upon the thought, that the accomplishment of the armament\r\n    program with speed and in quantity is _the_ problem of German\r\n    politics, that everything else therefore should be subordinated\r\n    to this purpose as long as the main purpose is not imperiled by\r\n    neglecting all other questions. Even after March 16, 1935, the\r\n    difficulty remains that one cannot undertake the open\r\n    propagandistic treatment of the German people for support of\r\n    armament without endangering our position internationally\r\n    (without loss to our foreign trade). The already nearly\r\n    impossible financing of the armament program is rendered hereby\r\n    exceptionally difficult.\r\n\r\n    “Another supposition must be also emphasized. The printing press\r\n    can be used only for the financing of armament to such a degree,\r\n    as permitted by maintaining of the money value. Every inflation\r\n    increases the prices of foreign raw materials and increases the\r\n    domestic prices, is therefore like a snail biting its own tail.\r\n    The circumstance that our armament had to be camouflaged\r\n    completely till March 16, 1935, and even since this date the\r\n    camouflage had to be continued to a larger extent, making it\r\n    necessary to use the printing press (bank note press) already at\r\n    the beginning of the whole armament program, while it would have\r\n    been natural, to start it (the printing press) at the final\r\n    point of financing. In the porte-feuille of the Reichsbank are\r\n    segregated notes for this purpose, that is, armament, of 3,775\r\n    millions and 866 millions, altogether 4,641 millions, out of\r\n    which the armament notes amount to Reichsmarks 2,374 millions,\r\n    that is, of April 30, 1935. The Reichsbank has invested the\r\n    amount of marks under its jurisdiction, but belonging to\r\n    foreigners in blank notes of armament. Our armaments are also\r\n    financed partly with the credits of our political opponents.\r\n    Furthermore, 500 million Reichsmarks were used for financing of\r\n    armament, which originated out of [_Reichsanleihe_], the federal\r\n    loans, placed with savings banks. In the regular budget, the\r\n    following amounts were provided. For the budget period 1933-34,\r\n    Reichsmarks 750 millions; for the budget period 1934-35,\r\n    Reichsmarks 1,100 millions; and for the budget period 1935-36,\r\n    Reichsmarks 2,500 millions.\r\n\r\n    “The amount of deficits of the budget since 1928 increases after\r\n    the budget 1935-36 to 5 to 6 millions Reichsmarks. This total\r\n    deficit is already financed at the present time by short term\r\n    credits of the money market. It therefore reduces in advance the\r\n    possibilities of utilization of the public market for the\r\n    armament. The Minister of Finance [_Reichsfinanzminister_],\r\n    correctly points out at the defense of the budget: As a\r\n    permanent yearly deficit is an impossibility, as we cannot\r\n    figure with security with increased tax revenues in amount\r\n    balancing the deficit and any other previous debits, as on the\r\n    other hand a balanced budget is the only secure basis for the\r\n    impending great task of military policy. For all these reasons\r\n    we have to put in motion a fundamental and conscious budget\r\n    policy which solves the problem of armament financing by organic\r\n    and planned reduction of other expenditures not only from the\r\n    point of receipt, but also from the point of expenditure, that\r\n    is, by saving.\r\n\r\n    “How urgent this question is, can be deduced from the following,\r\n    that a large amount of task has been started by the state and\r\n    party and which is now in process, all of which are not covered\r\n    by the budget, but from contributions and credits, which have to\r\n    be raised by industry in addition to the regular taxes.\r\n\r\n    “The existing of various budgets side by side, which serve more\r\n    or less public tasks, is the greatest impediment for gaining a\r\n    clear view over the possibilities of financing the armaments. A\r\n    whole number of ministries and various branches of the party\r\n    have their own budgets, and for this reason have possibilities\r\n    of incomes and expenses, though based on the sovereignty of\r\n    finance of the state, but not subject to the control of the\r\n    Minister of Finance and therefore also not subject to the\r\n    control of the cabinet. Just as in the sphere of politics the\r\n    much too far-reaching delegation of legislative powers to\r\n    individuals brought about various states within the states,\r\n    exactly in the same way the condition of various branches of\r\n    state and party, working side by side and against each other,\r\n    has a devastating effect on the possibility of financing. If on\r\n    this territory concentration and unified control is not\r\n    introduced very soon, the solution of the already impossible\r\n    task of armament financing is endangered.\r\n\r\n    “We have the following tasks:\r\n\r\n    “(1) A deputy is entrusted with finding all sources and\r\n    revenues, which have its origin in contributions to the federal\r\n    government, to the state and party and in profits of public and\r\n    party enterprises.\r\n\r\n    “(2) Furthermore experts, entrusted by the Fuehrer, have to\r\n    examine how these amounts were used and which of these amounts\r\n    can in the future be withdrawn from their previous purpose.\r\n\r\n    “(3) The same experts have to examine the investments of all\r\n    public and party organizations, to which extent this property\r\n    can be used for the purpose of armament financing.\r\n\r\n    “(4) The federal Ministry of Finance is to be entrusted to\r\n    examine the possibilities of increased revenues by way of new\r\n    taxes or increasing of existing taxes.\r\n\r\n    “The up-to-date financing of armaments by the Reichsbank under\r\n    existing political conditions was a necessity and the political\r\n    success proved the correctness of this action. The other\r\n    possibilities of armament financing have to be started now under\r\n    any circumstances. For this purpose all absolutely non-essential\r\n    expenditures for other purposes must not take place and the\r\n    total financial strength of Germany, limited as it is, has to be\r\n    concentrated for the one purpose of armament financing. Whether\r\n    the problem of financing, as outlined in this program, succeeds,\r\n    remains to be seen, but without such concentration, it will fail\r\n    with absolute certainty.” (_1168-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _Renunciation of Armament Provisions of Versailles Treaty._\r\n\r\n21 May 1935 was a very important date in the Nazi calendar. It was on\r\nthat date that the Nazis passed the secret Reich Defense Law\r\n(_2261-PS_). The secrecy of their armament operations had already\r\nreached the point beyond which they could no longer maintain successful\r\ncamouflage. Since their program called for still further expansion, they\r\nunilaterally renounced the armament provisions of the Versailles Treaty\r\non the same date, 21 May 1935. Hitler’s speech to the Reichstag on that\r\nday (_2288-PS_) was published in “_Voelkischer Beobachter_” under the\r\nheading “The Fuehrer Notifies the World of the Way to Real Peace.”\r\nHitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “1. The German Reich Government refuses to adhere to the Geneva\r\n    Resolution of 17 May.\r\n\r\n    “The Treaty of Versailles was not broken by Germany\r\n    unilaterally, but the well-known paragraphs of the dictate of\r\n    Versailles were violated, and consequently invalidated, by those\r\n    powers who could not make up their minds to follow the\r\n    disarmament requested of Germany with their own disarmament as\r\n    agreed upon by Treaty.\r\n\r\n    “2. Because the other powers did not live up to their\r\n    obligations under the disarmament program, the Government of the\r\n    German Reich no longer considers itself bound to those articles,\r\n    which are nothing but a discrimination against the German nation\r\n    for an unlimited period of time, since, through them, Germany is\r\n    being nailed down in a unilateral manner contrary to the spirit\r\n    of the agreement.” (_2288-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with other phases of planning and preparation for\r\naggressive war, there were various programs for direct and indirect\r\ntraining of a military nature. They included not only the training of\r\nmilitary personnel, but also the establishment and training of other\r\nmilitary organizations, such as the Police Force, which could be and\r\nwere absorbed by the Army. The extent of this program for military\r\ntraining is indicated by Hitler’s boast of the expenditure of ninety\r\nbillion Reichsmarks during the period 1933 to 1939, in the building up\r\nof the armed forces.\r\n\r\nIn a speech by Adolf Hitler delivered on 1 September, 1939, (_2322-PS_),\r\nwhich was published in the “_Voelkischer Beobachter_” under the heading\r\n“The Fuehrer announces the Battle for the Justice and Security of the\r\nReich”, the following passage occurred:\r\n\r\n    “For more than six years now, I have been engaged in building up\r\n    the German Armed Forces. During this period more than ninety\r\n    billion Reichsmarks were spent building up the _Wehrmacht_.\r\n    Today, ours are the best-equipped armed forces in the world, and\r\n    they are superior to those of 1914. My confidence in them can\r\n    never be shaken.” (_2322-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe secret nature of this training program and the fact of its early\r\ndevelopment is illustrated by a report to Hess, in 1932, concerning the\r\nsecret training of flying personnel, as well as the early plans to build\r\na military air force (_1143-PS_). This report was sent in a letter from\r\nSchickedantz to Rosenberg, for delivery to Hess. Apparently Schickedantz\r\nwas very anxious that no one but Hess should get this letter, and\r\ntherefore sent it to Rosenberg for personal delivery to Hess. The letter\r\npoints out that the civilian pilots should be so organized as to enable\r\ntheir transfer into the military air force organization. The letter\r\ndated 20 October 1932, reads:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Alfred [Rosenberg]: I am sending you enclosed a\r\n    communication from the RWM forwarded to me by our confidential\r\n    man (_Vertrauensmann_) which indeed is very interesting. I\r\n    believe we will have to take some steps so that the matter will\r\n    not be procured secretly for the Stahlhelm. This report is not\r\n    known to anybody else. I intentionally did not inform even our\r\n    tall friend.” [Rosenberg, in an interrogation on 5 October 1945,\r\n    identified this “tall friend” as being Von Albensleben.] “I am\r\n    enclosing an additional copy for Hess, and ask you to transmit\r\n    the letter to Hess by messenger, as I do not want to write a\r\n    letter to Hess for fear that it might be read somewhere. _Mit\r\n    bestem Gruss_, Yours Amo.” (_1143-PS_)\r\n\r\nEnclosed in the report is:\r\n\r\n                        “Air Force Organization”\r\n\r\n    “Purpose: Preparation of material and training of personnel to\r\n    provide for the case of the armament of the air force.\r\n\r\n    “Entire management as a civilian organization will be\r\n    transferred to Col. Von Willberg, at present commander of\r\n    Breslau, who, retaining his position in the Reichwehr, is going\r\n    on leave of absence.\r\n\r\n    “(a) Organizing the pilots of civilian air lines in such a way\r\n    as to enable their transfer to the air force organization.\r\n\r\n    “(b) Prospects to train crews for military flying. Training to\r\n    be done within the organization for military flying of the\r\n    Stahlhelm [steel helmet] which is being turned over to Col.\r\n    Hanel, retired.\r\n\r\n    “All existing organizations for sport flying are to be used for\r\n    military flying. Directions on kinds and tasks of military\r\n    flying will be issued by this Stahlhelm directorate. The\r\n    Stahlhelm organization will pay the military pilots 50 marks per\r\n    hour flight. These are due to the owner of the plane in case he\r\n    himself carries out the flight. They are to be divided in case\r\n    of non-owners of the plane, between flight organization,\r\n    proprietor and crew in the proportion of 10:20:20. Military\r\n    flying is now paid better than flying for advertisement (40). We\r\n    therefore have to expect that most proprietors of planes or\r\n    flying associations will go over to the Stahlhelm organization.\r\n    It must be achieved that equal conditions will be granted by the\r\n    RWM, also the NSDAP organization.” (_1143-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _Secret Rearmament_\r\n\r\nThe program of rearmament and the objectives of circumventing and\r\nbreaching the Versailles Treaty are forcefully shown by a number of Navy\r\ndocuments, showing the participation and cooperation of the German navy\r\nin this rearmament program which was secret at first. When it was deemed\r\nsafe to say so, the Navy openly acknowledged that it had always been its\r\nobjective to break the Versailles Treaty.\r\n\r\nIn 1937 the Navy High Command (OKM) published a secret book entitled,\r\n“The Fight of the Navy Against Versailles, 1919 to 1935”, written by Sea\r\nCaptain Schussler (_C-156_). The preface refers to the fight of the navy\r\nagainst the unbearable regulations of the peace treaty of Versailles.\r\nThe table of contents includes a variety of navy activities, such as\r\nsaving of coastal guns from destruction as required by Versailles;\r\nindependent armament measures behind the back of the government and\r\nbehind the back of the legislative bodies; resurrection of the U-boat\r\narm; economic rearmament; and camouflaged rearmament from 1933 to the\r\nfreedom from the restrictions in 1935. (_C-156_)\r\n\r\nThis book points out the significant effect of seizure of power by the\r\nNazis in 1933 on increasing the size and determining the nature of the\r\nrearmament program. It also refers to the far-reaching independence in\r\nthe building and development of the navy, which was only hampered\r\ninsofar as concealment of rearmament had to considered in compliance\r\nwith the Versailles Treaty (_C-156_). With the restoration of what was\r\ncalled the military sovereignty of the Reich in 1935—the reoccupation\r\nof the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland—the external camouflage of\r\nrearmament was eliminated.\r\n\r\nThis book of the German navy bears the symbol of the Nazi Party, the\r\nSwastika, in the spread eagle on the cover sheet, and it is headed\r\n“secret”, underscored (_C-156_). Raeder has identified this book in an\r\ninterrogation and explained that the Navy tried to fulfill the letter of\r\nthe Versailles Treaty and at the same time to make progress in naval\r\ndevelopment. The following are pertinent extracts from the book:\r\n\r\n    “The object and aim of this memorandum under the heading\r\n    ‘Preface’, is to draw a technically reliable picture based on\r\n    documentary records and the evidence of those who took part in\r\n    the fight of the Navy against the unbearable regulations of the\r\n    peace treaty of Versailles. It shows that the Reich navy after\r\n    the liberating activities of the Free Corps and of Scapa Flow\r\n    did not rest, but found ways and means to lay with unquenchable\r\n    enthusiasm, in addition to the building up of the 15,000-man\r\n    navy, the basis for a greater development in the future, and so\r\n    create by work of soldiers and technicians the primary condition\r\n    for a later rearmament. It must also distinguish more clearly\r\n    the services of these men, who, without being known in wide\r\n    circles, applied themselves with extraordinary zeal in\r\n    responsibility in the service of the fight against the peace\r\n    treaty; thereby stimulated by the highest feeling of duty, they\r\n    risked, particularly in the early days of their fight,\r\n    themselves and their position unrestrainedly in the partially\r\n    self-ordained task. This compilation makes it clearer, however,\r\n    that even such ideal and ambitious plans can be realized only to\r\n    a small degree if the concentrated and united strength of the\r\n    whole people is not behind the courageous activity of the\r\n    soldier. Only when the Fuehrer had created the second and even\r\n    more important condition for an effective rearmament in the\r\n    coordination of the whole nation and in the fusion of the\r\n    political, financial and spiritual power, could the work of the\r\n    soldier find its fulfillment. The framework of this peace\r\n    treaty, the most shameful known in world history, collapsed\r\n    under the driving power of this united will, [signed] The\r\n    Compiler”. (_C-156_)\r\n\r\nThe summary of the contents indicated in the chapter titles is\r\nsignificant:\r\n\r\n    “I.

Rearmament under the leadership of the Reich Government in\r\n    camouflage (from 1933 to the freedom from restrictions, 1935).”\r\n    (_C-156_)\r\n\r\nThe following is a passage from Chapter IV:\r\n\r\n    “The unification of the whole nation which was combined with the\r\n    taking over of power on 30 January 1933 was of the decisive\r\n    influence on the size and shape of further rearmament.\r\n\r\n    “While the second chamber, _Reichsrat_, approached its\r\n    dissolution and withdrew as a legislative body, the _Reichstag_\r\n    assumed a composition which could only take a one-sided attitude\r\n    toward the rearmament of the armed forces. The government took\r\n    over the management of the rearmament program upon this\r\n    foundation.\r\n\r\n                   “Development of the Armed Forces.”\r\n\r\n    “This taking over of the management by the Reich Government\r\n    developed for the armed forces in such a manner that the War\r\n    Minister, General von Blomberg, and through him the three\r\n    branches of the armed forces, received far-reaching powers from\r\n    the Reich Cabinet for the development of the armed forces. The\r\n    whole organization of the Reich was included in this way. In\r\n    view of these powers the collaboration of the former inspecting\r\n    body in the management of the secret expenditure was from then\r\n    on dispensed with. There remained only the inspecting duty of\r\n    the accounting office of the German Reich.\r\n\r\n          “Independence of the Commander in Chief of the Navy”\r\n\r\n    “The commander-in-chief of the Navy, Admiral Raeder, honorary\r\n    doctor, had received the help of a far-reaching independence in\r\n    the building and development of the navy. This was only hampered\r\n    insofar as the previous concealment of rearmament had to be\r\n    continued in consideration of the Versailles Treaty. Besides the\r\n    public budget there remained the previous special budget, which\r\n    was greatly increased in view of the considerable credit for the\r\n    provision of labor, which was made available by the Reich. Wide\r\n    powers in the handling of these credits were given to the\r\n    Director of the Budget Department of the navy, up to 1934\r\n    Commodore Schussler, afterwards Commodore Foerster. These took\r\n    into consideration the increased responsibility of the Chief of\r\n    the Budget.\r\n\r\n                   “Declaration of Military Freedom”\r\n\r\n    “When the Fuehrer, relying upon the strength of the armed forces\r\n    executed in the meanwhile, announced the restoration of the\r\n    military sovereignty of the German Reich, the last-mentioned\r\n    limitation on rearmament works namely, the external camouflage,\r\n    was eliminated. Freed from all the shackles which have hampered\r\n    our ability to move freely on and under water, on land and in\r\n    the air for one and a half decades, and carried by the\r\n    newly-awakened fighting spirit of the whole nation, the armed\r\n    forces, and as part of it, the navy, can lead with full strength\r\n    towards its completion the rearmament already under way with the\r\n    goal of securing for the Reich its rightful position in the\r\n    world.” (_C-156_)\r\n\r\nAn interrogation of Raeder concerning this book went as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Q. I have here a document, _C-156_, which is a photostatic copy\r\n    of the work prepared by the High Command of the Navy, and covers\r\n    the struggle of the Navy against the Versailles Treaty from 1919\r\n    to 1935. I ask you initially whether you are familiar with the\r\n    work?\r\n\r\n    “A. I know this book. I read it once when it was edited.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Was that an official publication of the Germany navy?\r\n\r\n    “A. This Captain Schuessler, indicated there, was Commander in\r\n    the Admiralty. Published by the OKM, which was an idea of these\r\n    officers to put all these things together.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Do you recall the circumstances under which the\r\n    authorization to prepare such a work was given to him?\r\n\r\n    “A. I think he told me that he would write such a book as he\r\n    told us here in the foreword.\r\n\r\n    “Q. In the preparation of this work he had access to the\r\n    official naval files, and based his work on the items contained\r\n    therein?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes, I think so. He would have spoken with other persons,\r\n    and he would have had the files, which were necessary.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Do you know whether before the work was published, a draft\r\n    of it was circulated among the officers in the Admiralty for\r\n    comment?\r\n\r\n    “A. No, I don’t think so. Not before it was published. I saw it\r\n    only when it was published.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Was it circulated freely after its publication?\r\n\r\n    “A. It was a secret object. I think the upper commands in the\r\n    Navy had knowledge of it.\r\n\r\n    “Q. It was not circulated outside of the naval circles?\r\n\r\n    “A. No.\r\n\r\n    “Q. What then is your opinion concerning the comments contained\r\n    in the work regarding the circumventing of the provisions of the\r\n    Versailles Treaty?\r\n\r\n    “A. I don’t remember very exactly what is in here. I can only\r\n    remember that the Navy had always the object to fulfill the word\r\n    of the Versailles Treaty, but wanted to have some advantages.\r\n    But the flying men were exercised one year before they went into\r\n    the Navy. Quite young men. So that the word of the Treaty of\r\n    Versailles was filled. They didn’t belong to the Navy, as long\r\n    as they were exercised in flying, and the submarines were\r\n    developed but not in Germany, and not in the Navy, but in\r\n    Holland. There was a civil bureau, and in Spain there was an\r\n    Industrialist; in Finland, too, and they were built much later\r\n    when we began to act with the English government about the\r\n    Treaty of thirty-five to one-hundred, because we could see that\r\n    then the Treaty of Versailles would be destroyed by such a\r\n    treaty with England, and so in order to keep the word of\r\n    Versailles, we tried to fulfill the word of Versailles, but\r\n    tried to have advantages.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Would the fair statement be that the Navy High Command was\r\n    interested in avoiding the limited provisions of the Treaty of\r\n    Versailles regarding the personnel and limits of armaments, but\r\n    would it attempt to fulfill the letter of the treaty, although\r\n    actually avoiding it?\r\n\r\n    “A. That was their endeavor”.\r\n\r\nRaeder had his explanations:\r\n\r\n    “Q. Why was such a policy adopted?\r\n\r\n    “A. We were much menaced in the first years after the first war\r\n    by danger that the Poles would attack East Prussia and so we\r\n    tried to strengthen a little our very, very weak forces in this\r\n    way, and so all our efforts were directed to the aim to have a\r\n    little more strength against the Poles, if they would attack us;\r\n    it was nonsense to them of attacking the Poles in this state,\r\n    and for the Navy a second aim was to have some defense against\r\n    the entering of French forces into the Ostsee, or East Sea,\r\n    because we knew the French had intentions to sustain the Poles\r\n    from ships that came into the Ostsee Goettinger, and so the Navy\r\n    was a defense against the attack by the Poles, and against the\r\n    entrance of French shipping into an Eastern Sea. Quite defensive\r\n    aims.\r\n\r\n    “Q. When did the fear of attack from Poles first show itself in\r\n    official circles in Germany would you say?\r\n\r\n    “A. When the first years they took Wilma. In the same minute we\r\n    thought that they would come to East Prussia. I don’t know\r\n    exactly the year, because those judgments were the judgments of\r\n    the German government ministers, of the Army and Navy Ministers,\r\n    Groner and Noske.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Then those views in your opinion were generally held\r\n    existing perhaps as early as 1919 or 1920, after the end of the\r\n    First World War?\r\n\r\n    “A. Oh, but the whole situation was very, very uncertain, and\r\n    about those years in the beginning, I can not give you a very\r\n    exact thing, because I was then two years in the Navy archives\r\n    to write a book about the war, and how the cruisers fought in\r\n    the first war. Two years, so I was not with these things.”\r\n\r\nThe same kind of aims and purposes are reflected in the table of\r\ncontents of a history of the German Navy, 1919 to 1939, found in\r\ncaptured official files of the German Navy (_C-17_). Although a copy of\r\nthe book itself has not been found, the project was written by Oberst\r\nScherff, Hitler’s special military historian. The table of contents\r\nhowever, is available. It refers by numbers to groups of documents and\r\nnotes in the documents, which evidently were intended as working\r\nmaterial for the basis of the chapters to be written in accordance with\r\nthe table of contents. The title of this table of contents fairly\r\nestablishes the navy planning and preparations that were to get the\r\nVersailles Treaty out of the way, and to rebuild the navy strength\r\nnecessary for war. Some of the headings in the table of contents read:\r\n\r\n    “_Part A (1919—The year of Transition.)_\r\n\r\n       “Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n    First efforts to circumvent the Versailles Treaty and to limit\r\n    its effects.\r\n\r\n    “Demilitarization of the Administration, incorporation of naval\r\n    offices in civil ministries, etc. Incorporation of greater\r\n    sections of the German maritime observation station and the\r\n    sea-mark system in Heligoland and Kiel, of the Ems-Jade-Canal,\r\n    etc. into the Reich Transport Ministry up to 1934;\r\n\r\n    “Noskos’ proposal of 11.8.1919 to incorporate the Naval\r\n    Construction Department in the Technical High School, Berlin;\r\n\r\n    “Formation of the “Naval Arsenal Kiel”.\r\n\r\n    “(b) The saving from destruction of coastal fortifications and\r\n    guns.\r\n\r\n    “1.

The Re-armament of the Navy under the Direction of the\r\n    Reich Government in a Disguised Way.” (_C-17_)\r\n\r\nThe policy development of the navy is also reflected from the financial\r\nside. The planned organization of the navy budget for armament measures\r\nwas based on a co-ordination of military developments and political\r\nobjectives. Military-political development was accelerated after the\r\nwithdrawal from the League of Nations. (_C-17_)\r\n\r\nA captured document, entitled “_Chef der Marineleitung_, Berlin, 12 May\r\n1934,” and marked “Secret Commando Matter,” discusses the “Armament Plan\r\n(A.P.) for the 3rd Armament Phase.” (_C-153_). This document, which\r\nbears the facsimile signature of Raeder at the end, speaks of war tasks,\r\nwar and operational plans, armament target, etc., and shows that it was\r\ndistributed to many of the High Command of the Navy. Dated 12 May 1934,\r\nit shows that a primary objective was readiness for a war without any\r\nalert period. The following are pertinent extracts:\r\n\r\n    * * * “The planned organization of armament measures is\r\n    necessary for the realization of the target; this again requires\r\n    a coordinated and planned expenditure in peace time. This\r\n    organization of financial measures over a number of years\r\n    according to the military viewpoint is found in the armament\r\n    program and provides\r\n\r\n    “_a._ for the _military leaders_ a sound basis for their\r\n    operational considerations and\r\n\r\n    “_b._ for the political leaders a clear picture of what may be\r\n    achieved with the military means available at a given time.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “All theoretical and practical A-preparations are to be drawn up\r\n    with a primary view to readiness for a war without any alert\r\n    period.” (C-153)\r\n\r\nThe conspiratorial nature of these Nazi plans and preparations long\r\nbefore the outbreak of hostilities is illustrated in many other ways.\r\nThus, in 1934, Hitler instructed Raeder to keep secret the U-Boat\r\nconstruction program; also the actual displacement and speed of certain\r\nships. Work on U-Boats had been going on, as already indicated, in\r\nHolland and Spain. The Nazi theory was ingenious in that respect. The\r\nVersailles Treaty forbade re-arming by the Germans in Germany, but the\r\nNazis said it did not forbid them to rearm in Holland, Spain, and\r\nFinland.\r\n\r\nSecrecy was equally important then because of the pending naval\r\nnegotiations with England. The subject was discussed in a conversation\r\nbetween Raeder and Adolf Hitler in June 1934. The record of that\r\nconversation (_C-189_) is not signed by Raeder, but in an interrogation\r\non 8 November 1945, Raeder admitted that (_C-189_) was a record of this\r\nconversation, and that it was in his handwriting, though he did not sign\r\nhis name at the end. The report is headed, “Conversation with the\r\nFuehrer in June 1934 on the occasion of the resignation of the\r\nCommanding Officer of the _Karlsruhe_.” It reads:\r\n\r\n    “1. Report by the C-in-C Navy concerning displacement of D. and\r\n    E. (defensive weapons).\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer’s instructions: No mention must be made of a\r\n    displacement of 25-26,000 tons, but only of improved 10,000-ton\r\n    (ships). Also, the speed over 26 nautical miles may be stated.\r\n\r\n    “2. C-in-C Navy expresses the opinion that later on the Fleet\r\n    must anyhow be developed to oppose England, that therefore from\r\n    1936 onwards, the large ships must be armed with 35 c.m. guns\r\n    (Like the King George Class).\r\n\r\n    “3. The Fuehrer demands to keep the construction of the U-Boats\r\n    completely secret. Plebiscite also in consideration of the\r\n    Saar.” (_C-189_)\r\n\r\nIn order to continue the increase in navy strength, as planned, more\r\nfunds were needed than the navy had available. Hitler therefore proposed\r\nto put funds of the Labor Front at the disposal of the navy. This\r\nappears from another Raeder memorandum of a conversation between Raeder\r\nwith Hitler, on 2 November 1934 (_C-190_). This report, again, is not\r\nsigned, but it was found in Raeder’s personal file and seems clearly his\r\nmemorandum. It is headed: “Conversation with the Fuehrer on 2.11.34 at\r\nthe time of the announcement by the Commanding Officer of the “Emden”.\r\nIt reads:\r\n\r\n    “1. When I mentioned that the total funds to be made available\r\n    for the armed forces for 1935 would presumably represent only a\r\n    fraction of the required sum, and that therefore it was possible\r\n    that the navy might be hindered in its plans, he replied that he\r\n    did not think the funds would be greatly decreased. He\r\n    considered it necessary that the navy be speedily increased by\r\n    1938 with the deadlines mentioned. In case of need, he will get\r\n    Dr. Ley to put 120-150 million from the Labor Front at the\r\n    disposal of the navy, as the money would still benefit the\r\n    workers. Later in a conversation with Minister Goering and\r\n    myself, he went on to say that he considered it vital that the\r\n    navy be increased as planned, as no war could be carried on if\r\n    the navy was not able to safeguard the ore imports from\r\n    Scandinavia.\r\n\r\n    “2. Then, when I mentioned that it would be desirable to have\r\n    six U-Boats assembled at the time of the critical situation in\r\n    the first quarter of 1935, he stated that he would keep this\r\n    point in mind, and tell me when the situation demanded that the\r\n    assembling should commence.” (_C-190_)\r\n\r\nThen there is an asterisk and a note at the bottom:\r\n\r\n    “The order was not sent out. The first boats were launched in\r\n    the middle of June 35 according to plan.” (_C-190_)\r\n\r\nThe development of the armament industry by the use of foreign markets\r\nwas a program encouraged by the navy, so that this industry would be\r\nable to supply the requirements of the navy in case of need. A directive\r\nof Raeder, dated 31 January 1933, and classified “Secret Commando\r\nMatter,” requires German industry to support the armament of the navy\r\n(_C-29_). It provides:\r\n\r\n                             “_TOP SECRET_\r\n _General directions for support given by the German Navy to the German\r\n                           Armament Industry_\r\n\r\n    “The effects of the present economic depression have led here\r\n    and there to the conclusion that there are no prospects of an\r\n    active participation of the German Armament Industry abroad,\r\n    even if the Versailles terms are no longer kept. There is no\r\n    profit in it and it is therefore not worth promoting.\r\n    Furthermore, the view has been taken that the increasing\r\n    “self-sufficiency” would in any case make such participation\r\n    superfluous.\r\n\r\n    “However obvious these opinions may seem, formed because of the\r\n    situation as it is today, I am nevertheless forced to make the\r\n    following contradictory corrective points:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ The economic crisis and its present effects must perforce\r\n    be overcome sooner or later. Though equality of rights in war\r\n    politics is not fully recognized today, it will, by the\r\n    assimilation of weapons, be achieved at some period, at least to\r\n    a certain extent,\r\n\r\n    “_b._ The consequent estimation of the duties of the German\r\n    Armament Industry lies mainly in the _Military-political_\r\n    sphere. It is impossible for this industry to satisfy,\r\n    militarily and economically, the growing demands made of it by\r\n    limiting the deliveries to our own armed forces. Its capacity\r\n    must therefore be increased by the delivery of supplies to\r\n    foreign countries over and above our own requirements.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Almost every country is working to the same end today,\r\n    even those which, unlike Germany, are not tied down by\r\n    restrictions. Britain, France, North America, Japan, and\r\n    especially Italy are making supreme efforts to ensure markets\r\n    for their armament industries. The use of their diplomatic\r\n    representations, of the propaganda voyages of their most modern\r\n    ships and vessels, of sending missions and also of the\r\n    guaranteeing of loans and insurance against deficits are not\r\n    merely to gain commercially advantageous orders for their\r\n    armament industries, but first and foremost to expand their\r\n    output from the point of view of military policy.\r\n\r\n    “_d._ It is just when the efforts to do away with the\r\n    restrictions imposed on us have succeeded, that the German Navy\r\n    has an ever-increasing and really vital interest in furthering\r\n    the German Armament Industry and preparing the way for it in\r\n    every direction in the competitive battle against the rest of\r\n    the world.\r\n\r\n    “_e._ If, however the German Armament Industry is to be able to\r\n    compete in foreign countries, it must inspire the _confidence_\r\n    of its purchasers. The condition for this is that secrecy for\r\n    our own ends be not carried too far. The amount of material to\r\n    be kept secret under all circumstances in the interest of the\r\n    defence of the country is comparatively small. I would like to\r\n    issue a warning against the assumption that, at the present\r\n    stage of technical development in foreign industrial states, a\r\n    problem of vital military importance which we perhaps have\r\n    solved, has not been solved there. Solutions arrived at today,\r\n    which may become known, if divulged to a third person by\r\n    naturally always possible indiscretion, have often been already\r\n    superseded by new and better solutions on our part, even at that\r\n    time or at any rate after the copy has been made. It is of\r\n    greater importance that we should be technically well to the\r\n    fore in any really fundamental matters, than that less important\r\n    points should be kept secret unnecessarily and excessively.\r\n\r\n    “_f._ To conclude: I attach particular importance to\r\n    guaranteeing the continuous support of the industry concerned by\r\n    the navy, even after the present restrictions have been relaxed.\r\n    If the purchasers are not made confident that something special\r\n    is being offered them, the industry will not be able to stand up\r\n    to the competitive battle and therefore will not be able to\r\n    supply the requirements of the German Navy in case of need.”\r\n    (C-29)\r\n\r\nThis surreptitious rearmament, in violation of treaty obligations,\r\nstarting even before the Nazi came into power, is illustrated by a 1932\r\norder of Raeder, chief of the naval command, addressed to the main naval\r\ncommand, regarding the concealed construction of torpedo tubes in\r\nE-Boats (_C-141_). He ordered that torpedo tubes be removed and stored\r\nin the naval arsenal but be kept ready for immediate refitting. By using\r\nonly the number permitted under the Treaty, at a given time, and by\r\nstoring them after satisfactory testing, the actual number of\r\noperationally effective E-Boats was constantly increased.\r\n\r\nThis German order for the concealed armament of E-Boats, issued by\r\nRaeder on 10 February 1932, provides:\r\n\r\n    “In view of our treaty obligations and the Disarmament\r\n    Conference steps must be taken to prevent the 1st\r\n    E-Boat-Half-Flotilla, which in a few months will consist of\r\n    exactly similar newly built (E)-Boats, from appearing openly as\r\n    a formation of torpedo-carrying boats as it is not intended to\r\n    count these E-Boats against the number of torpedo-carrying boats\r\n    allowed us.\r\n\r\n    “I therefore order:\r\n\r\n    “1. S2-S5, will be commissioned in the shipyard Luerssen,\r\n    Vegesack without armament, and will be fitted with easily\r\n    removable cover-sheet-metal on the spaces necessary for\r\n    torpedo-tubes. The same will be arranged by T.M.I. [Inspectorate\r\n    of Torpedoes and Mining] in agreement with the naval arsenal,\r\n    for the Boat ‘S1’ which will dismantle its torpedo-tubes, on\r\n    completion of the practice shooting, for fitting on another\r\n    boat.\r\n\r\n    “2. The torpedo-tubes of all S-Boats will be stored in the naval\r\n    arsenal ready for immediate fitting. During the trial runs the\r\n    torpedo-tubes will be taken on board one after the other for a\r\n    short time to be fitted and for practice shooting so that only\r\n    one boat at a time carries torpedo armament. For public\r\n    consumption this boat will be in service for the purpose of\r\n    temporary trials by the T.V.A. [Technical Research\r\n    Establishment].\r\n\r\n    “It should not anchor together with the other, unarmed boats of\r\n    the Half-Flotilla because of the obvious similarity of type. The\r\n    duration of firing, and consequently the length of time the\r\n    torpedo-tubes are aboard, is to be as short as possible.\r\n\r\n    “3. Fitting the torpedo-tubes on all E-Boats is intended as soon\r\n    as the situation of the political control allows it.” (_C-141_)\r\n\r\nAlong similar lines the navy was also carrying on the concealed\r\npreparation of auxiliary cruisers, under the disguised designation of\r\nTransport Ships O. The preparations under this order were to be\r\ncompleted by 1 April 1935. At the very time of construction of these\r\nships as commercial ships, plans were made for their conversion. This\r\nwas the result of a Top Secret order from the command office of the\r\nnavy, dated 12 March 1934, and signed in draft by Groos. This order\r\nbears the seal of the _Reichministerium, Marineleitung_, over the draft\r\nsignature. It provides:\r\n\r\n    “Subject: Preparation of Auxiliary Cruisers.\r\n\r\n    “It is intended to include in the Establishment Organization 35\r\n    (_AG-Aufstellungsgliederung_) a certain number of auxiliary\r\n    cruisers which are intended for use in operations on the high\r\n    seas.\r\n\r\n    “In order to disguise the intention and all the preparations the\r\n    ships will be referred to as “Transport Ships O”. It is\r\n    requested that in future this designation only will be used.\r\n\r\n    “The preparations are to be arranged so that they can be\r\n    completed by 1.4.35.” (_C-166_)\r\n\r\nIn the official navy files, notes were kept year by year, from 1927 to\r\n1940, on the reconstruction of the German Navy. One of these notes\r\ndiscloses that the displacement of the battleship\r\n“_Scharnhorst-Gneisenau_” was actually greater than the tonnage which\r\nhad been notified to the British under the treaty obligations:\r\n\r\n    “The true displacement of the battleship\r\n    ‘_Scharnhorst-Gneisenau_’ _and_ ‘F/G’ exceeds by 20 percent in\r\n    both cases the displacement reported to the British.” (_C-23_)\r\n\r\nThere is annexed to this document a table with reference to different\r\nships, and two columns, headed “Displacement by Type”; one column reads\r\n“Actual Displacement,” and the other, “Notified Displacement.” The\r\nactual displacement of the “_Scharnhorst_”, is thus shown to be 31,300\r\ntons, although the notified displacement was only 26,000 tons. On the\r\n“F/G” actual was 41,700, while notified was 35,000. On the “HI”, actual\r\nwas 56,200 tons, while notified was 46,850. And so on down the list.\r\n(_C-23_)\r\n\r\nIn these notes there also occurs the statement:\r\n\r\n    “In a clear cut program for the construction, the Fuehrer and\r\n    Reich Chancellor has set the navy the task of carrying out the\r\n    aims of his foreign policy.” (_C-23_)\r\n\r\nThe German Navy constantly planned and committed violations of armament\r\nlimitation, and with characteristic German thoroughness had prepared\r\nsuperficial pretexts to explain away these violations. Following a\r\nconference with the chief of “A” section [the military department of the\r\nNavy], an elaborate survey list was prepared and compiled, giving a\r\ncareful list of the quantity and type of German naval armament and\r\nammunition on hand under manufacture or construction (_C-32_). A\r\nstatement of the justification or defense that might be used was\r\nincluded in those instances where the Versailles Treaty was violated or\r\nits allotment has been exceeded. The list contained 30 items under\r\n“Material Measures” and 14 items under “Measures of Organization.” The\r\nvariety of details covered necessarily involved several sources within\r\nthe navy, which must have realized their significance.\r\n\r\nThis Top Secret document, which is headed “A Survey Report of German\r\nNaval Armament after Conference with Chief of “A” Section, dated 9\r\nSeptember 1933,” contains three columns, one headed “Measure,” one\r\nheaded “Material Measures, Details,” and the third headed “Remarks.” The\r\n“Remarks” contain the pretext or justification for explaining away the\r\nviolations of the treaty. The following are examples:\r\n\r\n“1. Exceeding the permitted number of mines.” Then figures are given.\r\n“Remarks: Further mines are in part ordered, in part being delivered.”\r\n(_C-32_)\r\n\r\n“Number 2. Continuous storing of guns from the North Sea area for Baltic\r\nartillery batteries.” The remarks column reads, “Justification:\r\nNecessity for over-hauling. Cheaper repairs.” (_C-32_)\r\n\r\n“Number 6. Laying gun-platforms in the Kiel area.” Remarks: “The offense\r\nover and above that in serial number 3 lies in the fact that all\r\nfortifications are forbidden in the Kiel area. This justification will\r\nmake it less severe; pure defense measures.” (_C-32_)\r\n\r\n“Number 7. Exceeding the calibre permitted for coastal batteries.”\r\nRemarks: “Possible justification is that, though the calibre is larger,\r\nthe number of guns is less.” (_C-32_)\r\n\r\n“Number 8. Arming of mine-sweepers.” Remarks: “The guns are taken from\r\nthe fleet reserve stores, have been temporarily installed only for\r\ntraining purposes. All nations arm their mine-sweeping forces (equality\r\nof rights).” (_C-32_)\r\n\r\n“Number 13. Exceeding the number of machine guns, et cetera, permitted.”\r\nRemarks: “Can be made light of.” (_C-32_)\r\n\r\n“Number 18. Construction of U-boat parts.” Remarks: “Difficult to\r\ndetect. If necessary can be denied.” (_C-32_)\r\n\r\n“Number 20. Arming of fishing vessels.” Remarks: “For warning shots.\r\nMake little of it.” And so on throughout the list (_C-32_). This\r\ndocument must have been used as a guide for negotiators who were\r\nattending the Disarmament Conference, as to the position that they might\r\ntake.\r\n\r\nE. _Withdrawal From the Disarmament Conference and the League of\r\nNations: Building of the Air Force._\r\n\r\nAt this point, on 14th October 1933, Germany withdrew from the\r\nInternational Disarmament Conference and from the League of Nations. The\r\nNazis took this opportunity to break away from the international\r\nnegotiations and to take an aggressive position on an issue which would\r\nnot be serious enough to provoke reprisal from other countries. At the\r\nsame time, Germany attached so much importance to this action that it\r\nconsidered the possibility of the application of sanctions by other\r\ncountries. In anticipation of the probable nature of such sanctions and\r\nthe countries which might apply them, plans were made for armed\r\nresistance on land, at sea, and in the air. Military preparations were\r\nordered in a directive from the Reichsminister for Defense (von\r\nBlomberg) to the head of the Army High Command (Fritsch), the head of\r\nthe Navy High Command, (Raeder), and the Reichsminister for Air,\r\n(Goering) (_C-140_). This directive, dated 25 October 1933, 11 days\r\nafter the withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League of\r\nNations, provides:\r\n\r\n    “1. The enclosed directive gives the basis for preparation of\r\n    the armed forces in the case of sanctions being applied against\r\n    Germany.\r\n\r\n    “2. I request the chiefs of the Army and Navy High Command and\r\n    the Reichsminister for Air to carry out the preparations in\r\n    accordance with the following points:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Strictest secrecy. It is of the utmost importance that no\r\n    facts become known to the outside world from which preparation\r\n    for resistance against sanctions can be inferred or which is\r\n    incompatible with Germany’s existing obligations in the sphere\r\n    of foreign policy regarding the demilitarized zone. If\r\n    necessary, the preparations must take second place to this\r\n    necessity.” (_C-140_)\r\n\r\nOne of the immediate consequences of this action was that following the\r\nwithdrawal from the League of Nations, Germany’s armament program was\r\nstill further increased. As it was ordered on 12 May, 1934:\r\n\r\n    “5. Owing to the speed of military political development since\r\n    Germany quitted Geneva and based on the progress of the army,\r\n    the new A-Plan will only be drawn up for a period of two years.\r\n    The third A phase lasts accordingly from 1.4.34 to 31.3.36.”\r\n    (_C-153_)\r\n\r\nOn 10 March 1935, Goering announced that Germany was building a military\r\nair force. At page 1830 of _Das Archiv_ it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister for Aviation, General of the Airmen,\r\n    Goering, in his talk with the special correspondent of the Daily\r\n    Mail, Ward Price, expressed himself on the subject of the German\r\n    Air Force.\r\n\r\n    “General Goering said:\r\n\r\n    “In the extension of our national defense [_Sicherheit_], it was\r\n    necessary, as we repeatedly told the world, to take care of\r\n    defense in the air. As far as that is concerned, I restricted\r\n    myself to those measures absolutely necessary. The guiding line\r\n    of my actions was, not the creation of an aggressive force which\r\n    would threaten other nations, but merely the completion of a\r\n    military aviation which would be strong enough to repel, at any\r\n    time, attacks on Germany.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion, the correspondent asked whether the German Air\r\n    Force will be capable of repelling attacks on Germany. General\r\n    Goering replied to that exactly as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The German Air Force is just as passionately permeated with the\r\n    will to defend the Fatherland to the last as it is convinced, on\r\n    the other hand, that it will never be employed to threaten the\r\n    peace of other nations.” (_2292-PS_)\r\n\r\nSince they had gone as far as they could on rearmament and the secret\r\ntraining of personnel, the next step necessary to the conspirators’\r\nprogram for aggressive war was a large-scale increase in military\r\nstrength. This could no longer be done under disguise and camouflage,\r\nand would have to be known to the world. Accordingly, on 16 March 1935,\r\nthere was promulgated a law for universal military service, in violation\r\nof Article 173 of the Versailles Treaty. That law appeared in the\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Title I, Vol. I, 1935, page 369. The text of the\r\nlaw itself provides:\r\n\r\n    “In this spirit the German Reich Cabinet has today passed the\r\n    following law:\r\n\r\n    “Law for the Organization of the Armed Forces of March 16, 1935.\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Cabinet has passed the following law which is\r\n    herewith promulgated:\r\n\r\n    “Section 1.\r\n\r\n    “Service in the Armed Forces is based upon compulsory military\r\n    duty.\r\n\r\n    “Section 2.\r\n\r\n    “In peace time, the German Army, including the police troops\r\n    transferred to it, is organized into: 12 Corps and 36 Divisions.\r\n\r\n    “Section 3.\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Minister of War is charged with the duty of\r\n    submitting immediately to the Reich Ministry detailed laws on\r\n    compulsory military duty.” (_1654-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe law is signed first by the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor Adolf\r\nHitler, and then by many other officials, including von Neurath, Frick,\r\nSchacht, Goering, Hess, and Frank. (_1654-PS_)\r\n\r\nF. _Assurances._\r\n\r\nAs a part of their program to weaken resistance in other states, the\r\nNazis followed a policy of making false assurances, thereby tending to\r\ncreate confusion and a false sense of security. Thus, on 21 May 1935,\r\nthe same date on which Germany renounced the armament provisions of the\r\nVersailles Treaty, Hitler announced the intent of the German Government\r\nto respect the territorial limitations of the Versailles and Locarno\r\nTreaties. In his speech in the Reichstag on that date Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, the Government of the German Reich shall absolutely\r\n    respect all other articles pertaining to the cooperation\r\n    [_zusammenleben_] of the various nations including territorial\r\n    agreements; revisions which will be unavoidable as time goes by\r\n    it will carry out by way of a friendly understanding only.\r\n\r\n    “The Government of the German Reich has the intention not to\r\n    sign any treaty which it believes not to be able to fulfill.\r\n    However, it will live up to every treaty signed voluntarily even\r\n    if it was composed before this government took over. Therefore,\r\n    it will in particular adhere to all the allegations under the\r\n    Locarno Pact as long as the other partners of the pact also\r\n    adhere to it.” (_2288-PS_)\r\n\r\nFor convenient reference, the territorial limitations in the Locarno and\r\nVersailles Treaties, include the following:\r\n\r\nArticle 1 of the Rhine Pact of Locarno, 16 October 1925, provides:\r\n\r\n    “The High Contracting parties, collectively and severally,\r\n    guarantee, in the manner provided in the following Articles: the\r\n    maintenance of the territorial status quo, resulting from the\r\n    frontiers between Germany and Belgium and between Germany and\r\n    France and the inviolability of the said frontiers, as fixed by,\r\n    or in pursuance of the Treaty of Peace, signed at Versailles, on\r\n    June 28, 1919, and also the observance of the stipulation of\r\n    Articles 42 and 43 of the said Treaty, concerning the\r\n    demilitarized zone.”\r\n\r\nThat has reference, of course, to the demilitarized zone of the\r\nRhineland.\r\n\r\nArticle 42 of the Versailles Treaty, 28 June 1919, provides:\r\n\r\n    “Germany is forbidden to maintain or construct any\r\n    fortifications either on the left bank of the Rhine or on the\r\n    right bank, to the west of the line drawn 50 kilometers to the\r\n    east of the Rhine.”\r\n\r\nArticle 43 provides:\r\n\r\n    “In the area defined above, the maintenance and the assembly of\r\n    armed forces, either permanently or temporarily and military\r\n    maneuvers of any kind, as well as the upkeep of all permanent\r\n    works for mobilization, are in the same way forbidden.”\r\n\r\nG. _Reoccupation of the Rhineland._\r\n\r\nThe demilitarized zone of the Rhineland was a sore spot with the Nazis\r\never since its establishment after World War I. Not only was this a blow\r\nto their increasing pride, but it was a bar to any effective strong\r\nposition which Germany might want to take on any vital issues. In the\r\nevent of any sanctions against Germany, in the form of military action,\r\nthe French and other powers would get well into Germany east of the\r\nRhine, before any German resistance could even be put up. Therefore, any\r\nGerman plans to threaten or breach international obligations, or for any\r\nkind of aggression, required the preliminary reoccupation and\r\nrefortification of this open Rhineland territory. Plans and preparations\r\nfor the reoccupation of the Rhineland started very early.\r\n\r\nA document apparently signed in the handwriting of von Blomberg, deals\r\nwith what is called “Operation _Schulung_”, meaning schooling or\r\ntraining (_C-139_). It is dated 2 May 1935 and refers to prior staff\r\ndiscussions on the subject. It is addressed to the Chief of the Army\r\nCommand, who at that time was Fritsch; the Chief of the Navy High\r\nCommand (Raeder); and the Reich Minister for Air (Goering). The document\r\ndoes not use the name “Rhineland” and does not, in terms, refer to it.\r\nIt seems clear, however, that it was a plan for the military\r\nreoccupation of the Rhineland, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles\r\nand the Rhine Pact of Locarno. The first part, headed “Secret Document,”\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n    “For the operation, suggested in the last staff talks of the\r\n    Armed Forces, I lay down the _Code name Schulung_ [training].\r\n\r\n    “The supreme direction of the operation ‘_Schulung_’ rests with\r\n    the Reich Minister of Defense as this is a joint undertaking of\r\n    the three services.\r\n\r\n    “Preparations for the operation will begin forthwith according\r\n    to the following directives:\r\n\r\n    “1. General.\r\n\r\n    “1. The operation must, on issue of the code word ‘Carry out\r\n    _Schulung_,’ be executed by a surprise blow at lightning speed.\r\n    _Strictest_ secrecy is necessary in the preparations and only\r\n    the very smallest number of officers should be informed and\r\n    employed in the drafting of reports, drawings, etc., and these\r\n    officers only in person.\r\n\r\n    “2. There is no time for mobilization of the forces taking part.\r\n    These will be employed in their peace-time strength and with\r\n    their peace-time equipment.\r\n\r\n    “3. The preparation for the operation will be made without\r\n    regard to the present inadequate state of our armaments. Every\r\n    improvement of the state of our armaments will make possible a\r\n    greater measure of preparedness and thus result in better\r\n    prospects of success.” (_C-139_)\r\n\r\nThe rest of the order deals with military details. There are certain\r\npoints in this order which are inconsistent with any theory that it was\r\nmerely a training order, or that it might have been defensive in nature.\r\nThe operation was to be carried out as a surprise blow at lightning\r\nspeed. The air forces were to provide support for the attack. There was\r\nto be reinforcement by the East Prussian division. Furthermore, since\r\nthis order is dated 2 May 1935, which is about 6 weeks after the\r\npromulgation of the Conscription Law of 16 March 1935, it could hardly\r\nhave been planned as a defensive measure against any expected sanctions\r\nwhich might have been applied by reason of the passage of the\r\nConscription Law.\r\n\r\nThe actual reoccupation of the Rhineland did not take place until 7\r\nMarch, 1936, and this early plan (_C-139_) necessarily underwent\r\nrevision to suit changed conditions and specific objectives. That the\r\ndetails of this particular plan were not ultimately the ones that were\r\ncarried out in reoccupying the Rhineland does not detract from the fact\r\nthat as early as 2 May 1935, the Germans had already planned that\r\noperation, not merely as a staff plan but as a definite operation. It\r\nwas evidently not on their timetable to carry out the operation so soon,\r\nif it could be avoided. But they were prepared to do so if necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is significant to note the date of this order is the same as the date\r\nof the signing of the Franco-Russian Pact, which the Nazis later\r\nasserted as their excuse for the Rhineland reoccupation.\r\n\r\nThe military orders on the basis of which the Rhineland reoccupation was\r\nactually carried into execution on 7 March 1936, were issued on 2 March\r\n1936 by the War Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, von\r\nBlomberg. They were addressed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army\r\n(Fritsch), the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (Raeder), and the Air\r\nMinister and C-in-C of the Air Force (Goering) (_C-159_). That order,\r\nclassified “Top Secret”, in the original bears Raeder’s initial in green\r\npencil, with a red pencil note, “To be submitted to the C-in-C of the\r\nNavy”.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the Order reads:\r\n\r\n    “Supreme Command of the Navy:\r\n\r\n    “1. The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor has made the following\r\n    decision:\r\n\r\n    “By reason of the Franco-Russian alliance, the obligations\r\n    accepted by Germany in the Locarno Treaty, as far as they apply\r\n    to Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, which\r\n    referred to the demilitarized zone, are to be regarded as\r\n    obsolete.\r\n\r\n    “2. Sections of the army and air force will therefore be\r\n    transferred simultaneously in a surprise move to garrisons of\r\n    the demilitarized zone. In this connection, I issue the\r\n    following orders: * * *” (_C-159_)\r\n\r\nThere follow detailed orders for the military operation.\r\n\r\nThe order for Naval cooperation was issued on 6 March 1936, in the form\r\nof an order on behalf of the Reich Minister for War, von Blomberg,\r\nsigned by Keitel, and addressed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy\r\n(Raeder) (_C-194_). The order set out detailed instructions for the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Fleet and the admirals commanding the Baltic\r\nand North Sea. The short covering letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “To: C-in-C Navy:\r\n\r\n    “The Minister has decided the following after the meeting:\r\n\r\n    “1. The inconspicuous air reconnaissance in the German bay, not\r\n    over the line Texel-Doggerbank, from midday on Z-Day onward, has\r\n    been approved. C-in-C air force will instruct the air command VI\r\n    from midday 7 March to hold in readiness single reconnaissance\r\n    aircraft to be at the disposal of the C-in-C fleet.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Minister will reserve the decision to set up a U-Boat\r\n    reconnaissance on line, until the evening of 7 March. The\r\n    immediate transfer of U-Boats from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven has\r\n    been approved.\r\n\r\n    “3. The proposed advance measures for the most part exceed\r\n    Degree of Emergency A and therefore are out of the question as\r\n    the first counter-measures to be taken against military\r\n    preparations of neighboring states. It is far more essential to\r\n    examine the advance measures included in Degree of Emergency A,\r\n    to see whether one or other of the especially conspicuous\r\n    measures could not be omitted.” (_C-194_)\r\n\r\nThe reoccupation and fortification of the Rhineland was carried out on 7\r\nMarch 1936. For the historical emphasis of this occasion, Hitler made a\r\nmomentous speech on the same day, in which he declared:\r\n\r\n    “Men of the German Reichstag! France has replied to the repeated\r\n    friendly offers and peaceful assurances made by Germany by\r\n    infringing the Reich pact through a military alliance with the\r\n    Soviet Union exclusively directed against Germany. In this\r\n    manner, however, the Locarno Rhine Pact has lost its inner\r\n    meaning and ceased in practice to exist. Consequently, Germany\r\n    regards herself, for her part, as no longer bound by this\r\n    dissolved treaty. The German government are now constrained to\r\n    face the new situation created by this alliance, a situation\r\n    which is rendered more acute by the fact that the Franco-Soviet\r\n    treaty has been supplemented by a Treaty of Alliance between\r\n    Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union exactly parallel in form. In\r\n    accordance with the fundamental right of a nation to secure its\r\n    frontiers and ensure its possibilities of defense, the German\r\n    government have today restored the full and unrestricted\r\n    sovereignty of Germany in the demilitarized zone of the\r\n    Rhineland.” (_2289-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe German reoccupation of the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland\r\ncaused extensive international repercussions. As a result of the\r\nprotests lodged with the League of Nations, the Council of the League\r\nmade an investigation and announced the following finding, which is\r\npublished in the League of Nations monthly summary, March, 1936, Volume\r\n16, Page 78. [It is also quoted in the _American Journal of\r\nInternational Law_, page 487 (1936)]:\r\n\r\n    “That the German government has committed a breach of Article 43\r\n    of the Treaty of Versailles, by causing on March 7, 1936,\r\n    military forces to enter and establish themselves in the\r\n    demilitarized zone, referred to in Article 42 and the following\r\n    articles of that Treaty, and in the Treaty of Locarno. At the\r\n    same time, on March 7, 1936, the Germans reoccupied the\r\n    Rhineland in flagrant violation of the Versailles and Locarno\r\n    Treaties. They again tried to allay the fears of other European\r\n    powers and lead them into a false sense of security by\r\n    announcing to the world ‘we have no territorial demands to make\r\n    in Europe.’”\r\n\r\nThe last phrase occurred in Hitler’s speech on 7 March 1936:\r\n\r\n    “We have no territorial claims to make in Europe. We know above\r\n    all that all the tensions resulting either from false\r\n    territorial settlements or from the disproportion of the numbers\r\n    of inhabitants to their living space cannot, in Europe, be\r\n    solved by war.” (_2289-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe existence of prior plans and preparations for the reoccupation and\r\nfortification of the Rhineland is indisputable. The method and sequence\r\nof these plans and their accomplishments are clearly indicative of the\r\nincreasingly aggressive character of the Nazi objectives, international\r\nobligations and considerations of humanity notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators were determined, as these documents have shown, to\r\nuse whatever means were necessary to abrogate and overthrow the Treaty\r\nof Versailles and its restrictions upon the military armament and\r\nactivity of Germany. In this process, they conspired and engaged in\r\nsecret armament and training, the secret production of munitions of war,\r\nand they built up an air force. They withdrew from the International\r\nDisarmament Conference and the League of Nations on 14 October 1933.\r\nThey instituted universal military service on 16 March 1935. On 21 May\r\n1935 they falsely announced that they would respect the territorial\r\nlimitations of Versailles and Locarno. On March 7 1936 they reoccupied\r\nand fortified the Rhineland and at the same time, falsely announced that\r\nthey had no territorial demands in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of all these objectives, particularly the repudiation\r\nof the Versailles Treaty restrictions, opened the gates for the numerous\r\naggressions which were to follow.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n   LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PREPARATION FOR\r\n                         AGGRESSION: 1933-1936\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F)  │      │\r\n                │  1, 2; V.                              │  I   │  22, 29\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

AGGRESSION AGAINST AUSTRIA\r\n\r\nA. _The Events Leading up to the Autumn of 1937 and the Strategic\r\nPosition of the National Socialists in Austria._\r\n\r\n(1) _The National Socialist Aim of Absorption of Austria._ In order to\r\nunderstand more clearly how the Nazi conspirators proceeded after the\r\nmeeting in the Reichschancellery on 5 November 1937, at which Hitler\r\nlaid plans for the conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia (_386-PS_), it\r\nis advisable to review the steps which had already been taken in Austria\r\nby the National Socialists of both Germany and Austria. The position\r\nwhich the Nazis had reached by the Fall of 1937 made it possible for\r\nthem to complete their absorption of Austria much sooner and with less\r\ncost than was contemplated in this meeting.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Austria had long been a central aim of the German\r\nNational Socialists. On the first page of _Mein Kampf_, Hitler had\r\nwritten, “German-Austria must return to the great German mother-land.”\r\nHe continued by stating that this purpose, of having common blood in a\r\ncommon Reich, could not be satisfied by a mere economic union. This aim\r\nwas regarded as a serious program which the Nazis were determined to\r\ncarry out.\r\n\r\nThis fact is borne out by an affidavit executed in Mexico City on 28\r\nAugust 1945 by George S. Messersmith, United States Ambassador in Mexico\r\nCity (_1760-PS_). Mr. Messersmith was Consul General of the United\r\nStates of America in Berlin from 1930 to the late Spring of 1934. He was\r\nthen made American Minister in Vienna, where he stayed until 1937. In\r\nthis affidavit he states that the nature of his work brought him into\r\nfrequent contact with German Government officials, many of whom were, on\r\nmost occasions, amazingly frank in their conversations, and made no\r\nconcealment of their aims.\r\n\r\nIn particular, Mr. Messersmith states that he had contact with the\r\nfollowing twenty governmental officials, among others: Hermann Goering,\r\nGeneral Milch, Hjalmar Schacht, Hans Frank, Wilhelm Frick, Count\r\nSchwerin von Krosigk, Josef Goebbels, Richard Walter Darré, Robert Ley,\r\nHans Heinrich Lammers, Otto Meissner, Franz von Papen, Walter Funk,\r\nGeneral Wilhelm Keitel, Admiral Erich von Raeder, Admiral Karl Doenitz,\r\nDr. Behle, Dr. Stuckart, Gustav Krupp von Bohlen, and Dr. Davidson. Mr.\r\nMessersmith further states that in addition to this contact with\r\nofficials of the Government he maintained contact with individuals in\r\nall parties in Germany in order to keep himself and the Government\r\ninformed of political developments in Germany.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Austrian matter, he states that from the very\r\nbeginning of the Nazi Party he was told by both high and secondary\r\ngovernment officials in Germany that incorporation of Austria into\r\nGermany was both a political and economic necessity and that this\r\nincorporation was going to be accomplished “by whatever means were\r\nnecessary.” He further states:\r\n\r\n    “I can assert that it was fully understood by everyone in\r\n    Germany who had any knowledge whatever of what was going on that\r\n    Hitler, and the Nazi Government were irrevocably committed to\r\n    this end and the only doubt which ever existed in conversations\r\n    or statements to me was ‘how’ and ‘when.’” (_1760-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Messersmith relates, at the beginning of the Nazi regime in 1933\r\nGermany was too weak to make open threats of force against any country.\r\nIt developed a policy of securing its aims in Austria in the same manner\r\nas in Germany—by obtaining a foothold in the Cabinet, particularly in\r\nthe Ministry of Interior which controls the police, and quickly\r\neliminating the opposition elements. Mr. Messersmith states that\r\nthroughout his stay in Austria he was told on any number of occasions by\r\nhigh officials of the Austrian Government, including Chancellor\r\nDollfuss, Chancellor Schuschnigg, and President Miklas, that the German\r\nGovernment kept up constant pressure upon the Austrian Government to\r\nappoint ministers with Nazi orientation.\r\n\r\n(2) _Pressure Used, Including Terror and Intimidation, Culminating in\r\nthe Unsuccessful Putsch of 25 July 1934._ To achieve their end the Nazis\r\nused various pressures. They used economic pressure. The law of 24 March\r\n1933 imposed a prohibitive 1,000 reichsmark penalty on trips to Austria,\r\nthus bringing hardship to Austria, which relied heavily on its tourist\r\ntrade (_Reichsgesetzblatt_ 1933, I, 311). The Nazis used propaganda. And\r\nthey used terroristic acts, primarily bombings.\r\n\r\nMr. Messersmith’s affidavit (_1760-PS_) goes into some detail with\r\nrespect to these means. Although they were committed by National\r\nSocialists in Austria, high Nazi officials in Germany admitted to Mr.\r\nMessersmith that they were instigating and directing these waves of\r\nterror in Austria. They made no effort to conceal their use of terror,\r\nwhich they justified on the ground that terror was a necessary\r\ninstrument to impose the will of the party not only in Germany but in\r\nother countries. Mr. Messersmith recalls specifically that General Milch\r\nof the Air Force stated that the terrorism in Austria was being directed\r\nby the Nazi Party in Berlin.\r\n\r\nMr. Messersmith points out that all these outrages were a common\r\noccurrence. They had peaks and distinct periods, one in mid-1933 and\r\nanother in early 1934. He points out that the wave of outrages in May\r\nand June 1934 diminished markedly for a few days during the meeting of\r\nHitler and Mussolini in Venice, in mid-June 1934. (At that time\r\nMussolini was strongly supporting the Austrian Government and interested\r\nin its independence.) Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit quotes extensively\r\nfrom dispatches sent from the American Legation in Vienna to the State\r\nDepartment during this period. These dispatches indicate that the terror\r\nwas often directed at Catholic Churches and institutions, and at\r\nrailways and tourist centers.\r\n\r\nMr. Messersmith also recalls that in addition, the Nazis maintained a\r\nthreat of violent action against Austria through the “Austrian Legion.”\r\nThis was a para-military force of several thousand men, armed by the\r\nNazis in Germany, and stationed in Germany near the Austrian border. It\r\nincluded Austrian Nazis who fled from Austria after committing crimes.\r\n\r\nThese terroristic activities of the Nazis in Austria continued until\r\nJuly 25, 1934. On that day members of the NSDAP attempted a\r\nrevolutionary putsch and killed Chancellor Dollfuss. A message from Mr.\r\nHadow, of the British Legation in Vienna, to Sir John Simon contains\r\ndetails of the putsch (_2985-PS_). The official version of events given\r\nverbally by the Austrian Government to the diplomatic Corps, as set\r\nforth in this document, stated that approximately a hundred men\r\nattempting the putsch seized the Federal Chancellery. Chancellor\r\nDollfuss was wounded in trying to escape, being shot twice at close\r\nquarters. The Radio Building in the center of the town was overwhelmed,\r\nand the announcer was compelled to broadcast the news that Dollfuss had\r\nresigned and Doctor Rintelen had taken his place as Chancellor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the putsch failed, the insurgents kept control of the\r\nChancellery Building and agreed to give it up only after they had a\r\nsafe-conduct to the German border. The insurgents contacted the German\r\nMinister, Dr. Rieth, by telephone, and subsequently had private\r\nnegotiations with him in the building. At about 7:00 p. m. they yielded\r\nthe building, but Chancellor Dollfuss died about 6:00 p. m., not having\r\nhad the services of a doctor.\r\n\r\nThe German Government denied all complicity in the putsch and\r\nassassination. Hitler removed Dr. Rieth as Minister on the ground that\r\nhe had offered a safe-conduct to the rebels without making inquiry of\r\nthe German Government, and had thus without any reason dragged the\r\nGerman Reich into an internal Austrian affair. This statement appears in\r\nthe letter which Hitler sent to Franz von Papen on the 26th day of July\r\n1934. (_2799-PS_)\r\n\r\nAlthough the German Government denied any knowledge or complicity in\r\nthis putsch, there is ample basis for the conclusion that the German\r\nNazis bear responsibility for the events. Light is shed on this matter\r\nin the extensive record of the trial of the Austrian Nazi, Planetta, and\r\nothers who were convicted for the murder, and in the Austrian Brown Book\r\nissued after July 25. Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit offers further\r\nevidence:\r\n\r\n    “The events of the Putsch of July 25, 1934, are too well known\r\n    for me to repeat them in this statement. I need say here only\r\n    that there can be no doubt that the Putsch was ordered and\r\n    organized by the Nazi officials from Germany through their\r\n    organization in Austria made up of German Nazis and Austrian\r\n    Nazis. Dr. Rieth, the German Minister in Vienna, was fully\r\n    familiar with all that was going to happen and that was being\r\n    planned. The German Legation was located directly across the\r\n    street from the British Legation and the Austrian secret police\r\n    kept close watch on the persons who entered the German Legation.\r\n    The British had their own secret service in Vienna at the time\r\n    and they also kept a discreet surveillance over people entering\r\n    the German Legation. I was told by both British and Austrian\r\n    officials that a number of the men who were later found guilty\r\n    by the Austrian Courts of having been implicated in the Putsch\r\n    had frequented the German Legation. In addition, I personally\r\n    followed very closely the activities of Dr. Rieth and I never\r\n    doubted on the basis of all my information that Dr. Rieth was in\r\n    close touch and constant touch with the Nazi agents in Austria;\r\n    these agents being both German and Austrian. Dr. Rieth could not\r\n    have been unfamiliar with the Putsch and the details in\r\n    connection therewith. I recall too very definitely from my\r\n    conversations with the highest officials of the Austrian\r\n    Government after the Putsch, their informing me that Dr. Rieth\r\n    had been in touch with von Rintelen, who it had been planned by\r\n    the Nazis was to succeed Chancellor Dollfuss had the Putsch been\r\n    successful.\r\n\r\n    “It may be that Dr. Rieth was himself not personally sympathetic\r\n    with the plans for the Putsch but there is no question that he\r\n    was fully familiar with all these plans and must have given his\r\n    assent thereto and connived therein.\r\n\r\n    “As this Putsch was so important and was a definite attempt to\r\n    overthrow the Austrian Government and resulted in the murder of\r\n    the Chancellor of Austria, I took occasion to verify at the time\r\n    for myself various other items of evidence indicating that the\r\n    Putsch was not only made with the knowledge of the German\r\n    Government but engineered by it. I found and verified that\r\n    almost a month before the Putsch, Goebbels told Signor Cerruti,\r\n    the Italian Ambassador in Berlin, that there would be a Nazi\r\n    Government in Vienna in a month.” (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\nMr. William Dodd, Ambassador of the United States to Germany, published\r\nin 1941 his Diary, covering the years 1933-1938 (_2832-PS_). The diary\r\ncontains an entry for July 26, 1934, which makes the following\r\nobservations. First, Ambassador Dodd noted that in February, 1934, Ernst\r\nHanfstaengl had advised him that he had brought what was virtually an\r\norder from Mussolini to Hitler to leave Austria alone and to dismiss and\r\nsilence Theodor Habicht, the German agent in Munich who had been\r\nagitating for annexation of Austria. On 18 June, in Venice, Hitler was\r\nreported to have promised Mussolini to leave Austria alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd further states:\r\n\r\n    “On Monday, July 23, after repeated bombings in Austria by\r\n    Nazis, a boat loaded with explosives was seized on Lake\r\n    Constance by the Swiss police. It was a shipment of German bombs\r\n    and shells to Austria from some arms plant. That looked ominous\r\n    to me, but events of the kind had been so common that I did not\r\n    report it to Washington.\r\n\r\n    “Today evidence came to my desk that last night, as late as\r\n    eleven o’clock, the government issued formal statements to the\r\n    newspapers rejoicing at the fall of Dollfuss and proclaiming the\r\n    Greater Germany that must follow. The German Minister in Vienna\r\n    had actually helped to form the new Cabinet. He had, as we now\r\n    know, exacted a promise that the gang of Austrian Nazi murderers\r\n    should be allowed to go into Germany undisturbed. But it was\r\n    realized about 12 o’clock that, although Dollfuss was dead, the\r\n    loyal Austrians had surrounded the government palace and\r\n    prevented the organization of a new Nazi regime. They held the\r\n    murderers prisoners. The German Propaganda Ministry therefore\r\n    forbade publication of the news sent out an hour before and\r\n    tried to collect all the releases that had been distributed. A\r\n    copy was brought to me today by a friend.\r\n\r\n    “All the German papers this morning lamented the cruel murder\r\n    and declared that it was simply an attack of discontented\r\n    Austrians, not Nazis. News from Bavaria shows that thousands of\r\n    Austrian Nazis living for a year in Bavaria on German support\r\n    had been active for ten days before, some getting across the\r\n    border contrary to law, all drilling and making ready to return\r\n    to Austria. The German propagandist Habicht was still making\r\n    radio speeches about the necessity of annexing the ancient realm\r\n    of the Hapsburgs to the Third Reich, in spite of all the\r\n    promises of Hitler to silence him. But now that the drive has\r\n    failed and the assassins are in prison in Vienna, the German\r\n    Government denounces all who say there was any support from\r\n    Berlin.\r\n\r\n    “I think it will be clear one day that millions of dollars and\r\n    many arms have been pouring into Austria since the spring of\r\n    1933. Once more the whole world is condemning the Hitler regime.\r\n    No people in all modern history has been quite so unpopular as\r\n    Nazi Germany. This stroke completes the picture. I expect to\r\n    read a series of bitter denunciations in the American papers\r\n    when they arrive about ten days from now.” (_2832-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn connection with the German Government’s denial of any connection with\r\nthe putsch and the murder of Dollfuss, the letter of appointment which\r\nHitler wrote to Vice-Chancellor von Papen on 26 July 1934 is\r\nsignificant. This letter appears in a standard German reference work,\r\n_Dokumente der Deutschen Politik, II, Page 83_ (_2799-PS_). (In\r\nconsidering the letter the report wide-spread at the time should be\r\nrecalled, that von Papen narrowly missed being purged on 30 June, 1944,\r\nalong with Ernst Roehm and others.) The letter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                       “26 July 1934\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. von Papen\r\n\r\n    “As a result of the events in Vienna I am compelled to suggest\r\n    to the Reichs President the removal of the German Minister to\r\n    Vienna, Dr. Rieth, from his post, because he, at the suggestion\r\n    of Austrian Federal Ministers and the Austrian rebels\r\n    respectively consented to an agreement made by both these\r\n    parties concerning the safe conduct and retreat of the rebels to\r\n    Germany without making inquiry of the German Reich Government.\r\n    Thus the Minister has dragged the German Reich into an internal\r\n    Austrian affair without any reason.\r\n\r\n    “The assassination of the Austrian Federal Chancellor which was\r\n    strictly condemned and regretted by the German Government has\r\n    made the situation in Europe, already fluid, more acute, without\r\n    any fault of ours. Therefore, it is my desire to bring about if\r\n    possible an easing of the general situation, and especially to\r\n    direct the relations with the German Austrian State, which have\r\n    been so strained for a long time, again into normal and friendly\r\n    channels.\r\n\r\n    “For this reason, I request you, dear Mr. von Papen, to take\r\n    over this important task, just because you have possessed and\r\n    continue to possess my most complete and unlimited confidence\r\n    ever since we have worked together in the Cabinet—\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, I have suggested to the Reichs President that you,\r\n    upon leaving the Reich-Cabinet and upon release from the office\r\n    of Commissioner for the Saar, be called on special mission to\r\n    the post of the German Minister in Vienna for a limited period\r\n    of time. In this position you will be directly subordinated to\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    “Thanking you once more for all that you have at one time done\r\n    for the coordination of the Government of the National\r\n    Revolution and since then together with us for Germany, I\r\n    remain,\r\n\r\n                                            Yours, very sincerely,\r\n                                                     Adolf Hitler.”\r\n                                                        (_2799-PS_)\r\n\r\nFour years later, on July 25, 1938, after the Anschluss with Austria,\r\nGerman officials no longer expressed regrets over the death of Dollfuss.\r\nThey were eager and willing to reveal what the world already knew—that\r\nthey were identified with and sponsors of the murder of the former\r\nChancellor. A dispatch from the American Consul General in Vienna to the\r\nSecretary of State, dated July 26, 1938, relates to the Nazis’\r\ncelebration of the murder of Dollfuss, held on July 24 and July 25,\r\n1938, four years after the event. It states:\r\n\r\n    “The two high points of the celebration were the memorial\r\n    assembly on the 24th at Klagenfurt, capital of the province of\r\n    Carinthia, where in 1934 the Vienna Nazi revolt found its widest\r\n    response, and the march on the 25th to the former Federal\r\n    Chancellery in Vienna by the surviving members of the S.S.\r\n    Standarte 89, which made the attack on the Chancellery in\r\n    1934—a reconstruction of the crime, so to say.\r\n\r\n    “The assembled thousands at Klagenfurt were addressed by the\r\n    Fuehrer’s deputy, Rudolf Hess, in the presence of the families\r\n    of the 13 National Socialists who were hanged for their part in\r\n    the July putsch. The Klagenfurt memorial celebration was also\r\n    made the occasion for the solemn swearing in of the seven\r\n    recently appointed Gauleiters of the Ostmark.\r\n\r\n    “From the point of view of the outside world, the speech of\r\n    Reichs Minister Hess was chiefly remarkable for the fact that\r\n    after devoting the first half of his speech to the expected\r\n    praise of the sacrifices of the men, women and youths of Austria\r\n    in the struggle for a greater Germany, he then launched into a\r\n    defense of the occupation of Austria and an attack on the ‘lying\r\n    foreign press’ and on those who spread the idea of a new war.\r\n    The world was fortunate, declared Hess, that Germany’s leader\r\n    was a man who would not allow himself to be provoked. ‘The\r\n    Fuehrer does what is necessary for his people in sovereign calm.\r\n    * * * and labors for the peace of Europe’ even though\r\n    provocators, ‘completely ignoring the deliberate threat to peace\r\n    of certain small states,’ deceitfully claim that he is a menace\r\n    to the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\n    “The march on the former Federal Chancellery, now the\r\n    Reichsstatthalterei, followed the exact route and time schedule\r\n    of the original attack. The marchers were met at the Chancellery\r\n    by the Reichsstatthalter Seyss-Inquart, who addressed them and\r\n    unveiled a memorial tablet. From the Reichsstatthalterei the\r\n    Standarte marched to the old RAVAG broadcasting center from\r\n    which false news of the resignation of Dollfuss had been\r\n    broadcast, and there unveiled a second memorial tablet.\r\n    Steinhausl, the present Police President of Vienna, is a member\r\n    of the S. S. Standarte 89”. (_L-273_)\r\n\r\nThe original plaque is now rubble. But a photograph of it was found in\r\nThe National Library in Vienna. [The photograph was offered in evidence\r\nat the trial. See _2968-PS_.] The plaque reads: “154 German men of 89 SS\r\nStandarte stood up here for Germany on July 26, 1934. Seven found death\r\nat the hands of the hangman”. The words chosen for this marble tablet,\r\nand it may be presumed that they were words chosen carefully, reveal\r\nclearly that the men involved were not mere malcontent Austrian\r\nrevolutionaries, but were regarded as German men, were members of a\r\npara-military organization, who stood up here “for Germany.” In 1934\r\nHitler repudiated Dr. Rieth because he “dragged the German Reich into an\r\ninternal Austrian affair without any reason”. In 1938 Nazi Germany\r\nproudly identified itself with this murder, took credit for it, and took\r\nresponsibility for it.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Program Culminating in the Pact of July 11, 1936._ In\r\nconsidering the activities of the Nazi conspirators in Austria between\r\n25 July 1934 and November 1937, there is a distinct intermediate point,\r\nthe Pact of 11 July 1936. Accordingly, developments in the two-year\r\nperiod, July 1934 to July 1936, will first be reviewed.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Continued Aim of Eliminating Austria’s Independence—Conversation\r\nand Activities of von Papen._ The Nazi conspirators pretended to respect\r\nthe independence and sovereignty of Austria, notwithstanding the aim of\r\nAnschluss stated in _Mein Kampf_. But in truth and in fact they were\r\nworking from the very beginning to destroy the Austrian State.\r\n\r\nA dramatic recital of the position of von Papen in this regard is\r\nprovided in Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit. It states:\r\n\r\n    “When I did call on von Papen in the German Legation, he greeted\r\n    me with ‘Now you are in my Legation and I can control the\r\n    conversation.’ In the baldest and most cynical manner he then\r\n    proceeded to tell me that all of Southeastern Europe, to the\r\n    borders of Turkey, was Germany’s natural hinterland, and that he\r\n    had been charged with the mission of facilitating German\r\n    economic and political control over all this region for Germany.\r\n    He blandly and directly said that getting control of Austria was\r\n    to be the first step. He definitely stated that he was in\r\n    Austria to undermine and weaken the Austrian Government and from\r\n    Vienna to work towards the weakening of the Governments in the\r\n    other states to the South and Southeast. He said that he\r\n    intended to use his reputation as a good Catholic to gain\r\n    influence with certain Austrians, such as Cardinal Innitzer,\r\n    towards that end. He said that he was telling me this because\r\n    the German Government was bound on this objective of getting\r\n    this control of Southeastern Europe and there was nothing which\r\n    could stop it and that our own policy and that of France and\r\n    England was not realistic.\r\n\r\n    “The circumstances were such, as I was calling on him in the\r\n    German Legation, that I had to listen to what he had to say and\r\n    of course I was prepared to hear what he had to say although I\r\n    already knew what his instructions were. I was nevertheless\r\n    shocked to have him speak so baldly to me and when he finished I\r\n    got up and told him how shocked I was to hear the accredited\r\n    representative of a supposedly friendly state to Austria admit\r\n    that he was proposing to engage in activities to undermine and\r\n    destroy that Government to which he was accredited. He merely\r\n    smiled and said, of course this conversation was between us and\r\n    that he would of course, not be talking to others so clearly\r\n    about his objectives. I have gone into this detail with regard\r\n    to this conversation as it is characteristic of the absolute\r\n    frankness and directness with which high Nazi officials spoke of\r\n    their objectives.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “On the surface, however, German activities consisted\r\n    principally of efforts to win the support of prominent and\r\n    influential men through insidious efforts of all kinds,\r\n    including the use of the German Diplomatic Mission in Vienna and\r\n    its facilities and personnel. Von Papen as German Minister\r\n    entertained frequently and on a lavish scale. He approached\r\n    almost every member of the Austrian Cabinet, telling them, as\r\n    several of them later informed me, that Germany was bound to\r\n    prevail in the long run and that they should join the winning\r\n    side if they wished to enjoy positions of power and influence\r\n    under German control. Of course, openly and outwardly he gave\r\n    solemn assurance that Germany would respect Austrian\r\n    independence and that all that she wished to do was to get rid\r\n    of elements in the Austrian Government like the Chancellor,\r\n    Schuschnigg and Starhemberg as head of the Heimwehr and others,\r\n    and replace them by a few ‘nationally-minded’ Austrians, which\r\n    of course meant Nazis. The whole basic effort of von Papen was\r\n    to bring about Anschluss.\r\n\r\n    “In early 1935, the Austrian Foreign Minister, Berger-Waldenegg,\r\n    informed me that in the course of a conversation with von Papen,\r\n    the latter had remarked ‘Yes, you have your French and English\r\n    friends now and you can have your independence a little longer’.\r\n    The Foreign Minister, of course, told me this remark in German\r\n    but the foregoing is an accurate translation. The Foreign\r\n    Minister told me that he had replied to von Papen ‘I am glad to\r\n    have from your own lips your own opinion which agrees with what\r\n    your Chief has just said in the Saar and which you have taken\r\n    such pains to deny.’\r\n\r\n    “Von Papen undoubtedly achieved some successes, particularly\r\n    with men like Glaise-Horstenau and others who had long favored\r\n    the ‘Grossdeutschum’ idea, but who nevertheless had been greatly\r\n    disturbed by the fate of the Catholic Church. Without conscience\r\n    or scruple, von Papen exploited his reputation and that of his\r\n    wife as ardent and devout Catholics to overcome the fears of\r\n    these Austrians in this respect.” (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Continued Existence of Nazi Organizations with a Program of Armed\r\nPreparedness._ The wiles of von Papen represented only one part of the\r\ntotal program of the Nazi conspiracy. At the same time Nazi activities\r\nin Austria, forced underground during this period, were carried on.\r\n\r\nMr. Messersmith’s affidavit discloses the following: The Nazi\r\norganization, weakened in the events following the putsch, began\r\nreorganization work. An informant furnished the Austrian Government with\r\na memorandum of a meeting of Austrian Nazi chiefs held in Bavaria,\r\nSeptember, 1934. The memorandum shows that they agreed to prepare for\r\nnew terroristic acts, to proceed brutally against persons cooperating\r\nwith the Schuschnigg Government when the next action against the\r\nGovernment took place, and to appear disposed to negotiate but to arm\r\nfor the struggle. A copy of this memorandum was furnished to Mr.\r\nMessersmith. At the same time the Austrian Legion was kept in readiness\r\nin Germany. This large, organized hostile group constituted a continuing\r\nmenace for Austria. (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe fact of the reorganization of the Nazi party in Austria is\r\ncorroborated by a report of one of the Austrian Nazis, Rainer\r\n(_812-PS_). (_812-PS_ contains three parts. First there is a letter\r\ndated 22 August 1939 from Rainer, then Gauleiter at Salzburg, to\r\nSeyss-Inquart, then Reich Minister. That letter encloses a letter dated\r\n6 July 1939, written by Rainer to Reich Commissioner and Gauleiter Josef\r\nBuerckel. In that letter, in turn, Rainer inclosed a report on the\r\nevents in the NSDAP of Austria from 1933 to 11 March 1938, the day\r\nbefore the invasion of Austria.)\r\n\r\nThe letter from Rainer to Buerckel indicates that he was asked to\r\nprepare a short history of the role of the party. He states that after\r\nthe Anschluss Hitler and the general public gave Seyss-Inquart alone\r\ncredit for effecting the Anschluss. It is Rainer’s belief that credit\r\nbelongs to the entire Party, the leaders of which had to remain\r\nunderground. And so Rainer writes his report to show that the Party as a\r\nwhole is entitled to “the glory which was excessively ascribed to one\r\nperson, Dr. Seyss-Inquart”.\r\n\r\nApparently Seyss-Inquart heard from Buerckel what Rainer said, and wrote\r\nto Rainer asking for an explanation. To avoid misunderstanding, Rainer\r\nprepared for Seyss-Inquart a copy of his letter to Buerckel and his\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe Rainer report tells of the disorganization of the Nazi party in\r\nAustria and of its reconstitution. The second and third paragraphs of\r\nthe report state:\r\n\r\n    “Thus the first stage of battle commenced which ended with the\r\n    July rising of 1934. The decision for the July rising was right,\r\n    the execution of it was faulty. The result was a complete\r\n    destruction of the organization; the loss of entire groups of\r\n    fighters through imprisonment or flight into the ‘Alt-Reich’;\r\n    and with regard to the political relationship of Germany to\r\n    Austria, a formal acknowledgment of the existence of the\r\n    Austrian State by the German Government. With the telegram to\r\n    PAPEN, instructing him to reinstitute normal relationships\r\n    between the two states, the Fuehrer had liquidated the first\r\n    stage of the battle; and a new method of political penetration\r\n    was to begin. By order of the Fuehrer the Landesleitung Munich\r\n    was dissolved, and the party in Austria was left to its own\r\n    resources.\r\n\r\n    “There was no acknowledged leader for the entire party in\r\n    Austria. New leaderships were forming in the nine Gaus. The\r\n    process was again and again interrupted by the interference of\r\n    the police; there was no liaison between the formations, and\r\n    frequently there were two, three or more rival leaderships. The\r\n    first evident, acknowledged speaker of almost all the Gaus in\r\n    Autumn 1934 was engineer REINTHALLER (already appointed\r\n    Landesbauernfeuhrer (leader of the country’s farmers) by Hess).\r\n    He endeavored to bring about a political appeasement by\r\n    negotiations with the government, with the purpose of giving the\r\n    NSDAP legal status again, thus permitting its political\r\n    activities. Simultaneously Reinthaller started the\r\n    reconstruction of the illegal political organization, at the\r\n    head of which he had placed engineer NEUBACHER.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Secret Contacts Between German Officials, Including Papen, and\r\nthe Austrian Nazis: the Use by the Austrian Nazis of “Front”\r\nPersonalities._ Two cardinal factors about the Nazi organization in\r\nAustria should be borne in mind. First, although the Fuehrer had on the\r\nsurface cast the Austrian Nazis adrift, in fact German officials,\r\nincluding Papen, maintained secret contact with the Austrian Nazis, in\r\nline with Hitler’s desires. German officials consulted and gave advice\r\nand support to the organization of the Austrian Nazis. In the second\r\nplace, the Austrian Nazis remained an illegal organization, organizing\r\nfor the eventual use of force in an “emergency.” But in the meanwhile\r\nthey deemed it expedient to act behind “front” personalities, such as\r\nSeyss-Inquart, who had no apparent taint of illegality.\r\n\r\nMr. Messersmith relates in his affidavit that he obtained a copy of a\r\ndocument outlining this Nazi program.\r\n\r\n    “For two years following the failure of the July 25 Putsch, the\r\n    Nazis remained relatively quiet in Austria. Very few terroristic\r\n    acts occurred during the remainder of 1934 and as I recall in\r\n    1935 and most of 1936; this inactivity was in accordance with\r\n    directives from Berlin as direct evidence to that effect, which\r\n    came to my knowledge at that time, proved. Early in January, the\r\n    Austrian Foreign Minister, Berger-Waldenegg, furnished me a\r\n    document which I considered accurate in all respects and which\r\n    stated:\r\n\r\n        ‘The German Minister here, von Papen, on the occasion of\r\n        his last visit to Berlin, was received three times by\r\n        Chancellor Hitler for fairly long conversations, and he\r\n        also took this opportunity to call on Schacht and von\r\n        Neurath. In these conversations the following\r\n        instructions were given to him:\r\n\r\n        ‘During the next two years nothing can be undertaken\r\n        which will give Germany external political difficulties.\r\n        On this ground, everything must be avoided which could\r\n        awaken the appearance of Germany interfering in the\r\n        internal affairs of Austria. Chancellor Hitler will,\r\n        therefore, also for this reason not endeavor to\r\n        intervene in the present prevailing difficult crisis in\r\n        the National Socialist Party in Austria, although he is\r\n        convinced that order could be brought into the Party at\r\n        once through a word from him. This word, however, he\r\n        will, for foreign political reasons, give all the less,\r\n        as he is convinced that the, for him, desirable ends may\r\n        be reached also in another way. Naturally, Chancellor\r\n        Hitler declared to the German Minister here, this does\r\n        not indicate any disinterestedness in the idea of\r\n        Austria’s independence. Also, before everything, Germany\r\n        cannot for the present withdraw Party members in\r\n        Austria, and must, therefore, in spite of the very real\r\n        exchange difficulties, make every effort to bring help\r\n        to the persecuted National Socialist sufferers in\r\n        Austria. As a result, Minister of Commerce Schacht\r\n        finally gave the authorization that from then on 200,000\r\n        marks a month were to be set aside for this end (support\r\n        of National Socialists in Austria). The control and the\r\n        supervision of this monthly sum was to be entrusted to\r\n        Engineer Reinthaller, who, through the fact that he\r\n        alone had control over the money, would have a definite\r\n        influence on the Party followers. In this way it would\r\n        be possible to end most quickly and most easily the\r\n        prevailing difficulties and division in the Austrian\r\n        National Socialist Party.\r\n\r\n        ‘The hope was also expressed to Herr von Papen that the\r\n        recently authorized foundation of German “Ortsgruppen”\r\n        of the National Socialist Party in Austria (made up of\r\n        German citizens in Austria) would be so arranged as not\r\n        to give the appearance that Germany is planning to\r\n        interfere in Austrian internal affairs.’” (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report of Gauleiter Rainer to Reichskommissar Buerckel in July 1939,\r\noutlines the further history of the party and the leadership squabbles\r\nfollowing the retirement of Reinthaller. In referring to the situation\r\nin 1935, he mentions some of the contacts with the Reich Government in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\n    “In August some further arrests took place, the victims of which\r\n    were, apart from the Gauleaders, also Globocnik and Rainer.\r\n    SCHATTENFROH then claimed, because of an instruction received\r\n    from the imprisoned LEOPOLD, to have been made deputy country\r\n    leader. A group led by engineer RAFFELSBERGER had at this time\r\n    also established connections with departments of the Alt-Reich\r\n    (Ministry of Propaganda, German Racial Agency, etc.) and made an\r\n    attempt to formulate a political motto in the form of a program\r\n    for the fighting movement of Austria.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Rainer report sets forth the situation a little later in 1936:\r\n\r\n    “The principles of the construction of the organization were:\r\n    The organization is the bearer of the illegal fight and the\r\n    trustee of the idea to create a secret organization, in a simple\r\n    manner, and without compromise, according to the principle of\r\n    organizing an elite to be available to the illegal land-party\r\n    council upon any emergency. Besides this, all political\r\n    opportunities should be taken and all legal people and legal\r\n    chances should be used without revealing any ties with the\r\n    illegal organization. Therefore, cooperation between the illegal\r\n    party organization and the legal political aides was anchored at\r\n    the top of the party leadership. All connections with the party\r\n    in Germany were kept secret in accordance with the orders of the\r\n    Fuehrer. These said that the German state should officially be\r\n    omitted from the creation of an Austrian NSDAP; and that\r\n    auxiliary centers for propaganda, press, refugees, welfare, etc.\r\n    should be established in the foreign countries bordering\r\n    Austria.\r\n\r\n    “Hinterleitner already contacted the lawyer Seyss-Inquart, who\r\n    had connections with Dr. Wachter which originated from\r\n    Seyss-Inquart’s support of the July uprising. On the other side\r\n    Seyss-Inquart had a good position in the legal field and\r\n    especially well-established relations with Christian-Social\r\n    politicians. Dr. Seyss-Inquart came from the ranks of the\r\n    ‘Styrian Heimatschutz’ and became a party member when the entire\r\n    ‘Styrian Heimatschutz’ was incorporated into the NSDAP. Another\r\n    personality who had a good position in the legal field was Col.\r\n    Glaise-Horstenau who had contacts with both sides. The agreement\r\n    of 11 July 1936 was strongly influenced by the activities of\r\n    these two persons. Papen mentioned Glaise-Horstenau to the\r\n    Fuehrer as being a trusted person.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Rainer report thus discloses the dual tactics of the Austrian Nazis\r\nduring this period of keeping quiet and awaiting developments. They were\r\nmaintaining their secret contacts with Reich officials, and using\r\n“front” personalities such as Glaise-Horstenau and Seyss-Inquart. The\r\nNazis made good use of such figures, who were more discreet in their\r\nactivities and could be referred to as “Nationalists”. They presented,\r\nsupported, and obtained consideration of demands which could not be\r\nnegotiated by out-and-out Nazis like Captain Leopold. Seyss-Inquart did\r\nnot hold any public office until January 1937, when he was made\r\nCouncillor of State. But Rainer, describing him as a trustworthy member\r\nof the Party through the ranks of the Styrian Heimatschutz, points him\r\nout as one who strongly influenced the agreement of 11 July 1936.\r\n\r\nThat the Nazis, but not the Austrian Government, did well to trust\r\nSeyss-Inquart, is indicated by a letter, dated 14 July 1939, addressed\r\nto Field Marshal Goering (_2219-PS_). The letter ends with the “Heil\r\nHitler” close and is not signed, but it was undoubtedly written by\r\nSeyss-Inquart. It was found among Seyss-Inquart’s personal files. On the\r\nfirst page of the letter there appears a note in ink, not indicated in\r\nthe partial English translation, reading: “Air Mail. 15 July, 1515\r\nhours, Berlin, brought to Goering’s office.”\r\n\r\nThe main text of the letter consists of a plea for intercession in\r\nbehalf of one Muehlmann, who unfortunately got in Buerckel’s bad graces.\r\nAn extract from the letter, which shows Seyss-Inquart as one whose\r\nloyalty to Hitler and the aims of the Nazi conspiracy led him to fight\r\nfor the Anschluss with all the means at his disposal, reads:\r\n\r\n                                 At Present In Vienna, 14 July 1939\r\n\r\n    “To the General Field Marshal\r\n\r\n    Sir:\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “If I may add something about myself, it is the following: I\r\n    know that I am not of an active fighting nature, unless final\r\n    decisions are at stake. At this time of pronounced activism\r\n    (_Aktivismus_) this will certainly be regarded as a fault in my\r\n    personality. Yet I know that I cling with unconquerable tenacity\r\n    to the goal in which I believe. That is Greater Germany\r\n    (_Grossdeutschland_) and the FUEHRER. And if some people are\r\n    already tired out from the struggle and some have been killed in\r\n    the fight, I am still around somewhere and ready to go into\r\n    action. This, after all, was also the development until the year\r\n    1938. Until July 1934 I conducted myself as a regular member of\r\n    the party. And if I had quietly, in whatever form, paid my\r\n    membership dues the first one, according to a receipt, I paid in\r\n    December 1931. I probably would have been an undisputed,\r\n    comparatively old fighter and party member of Austria, but I\r\n    would not have done any more for the union. I told myself in\r\n    July 1934 that we must fight this clerical regime on its own\r\n    ground in order to give the Fuehrer a chance to use whatever\r\n    method he desires. I told myself that this Austria was worth a\r\n    mass. I have stuck to this attitude with an iron determination\r\n    because I and my friends had to fight against the whole\r\n    political church, the Freemasonry, the Jewry, in short, against\r\n    everything in Austria. The slightest weakness which we might\r\n    have displayed would undoubtedly have led to our political\r\n    annihilation; it would have deprived the Fuehrer of the means\r\n    and tools to carry out his ingenious political solution for\r\n    Austria, as became evident in the days of March 1938. I have\r\n    been fully conscious of the fact that I am following a path\r\n    which is not comprehensible to the masses and also not to my\r\n    party comrades. I followed it calmly and would without\r\n    hesitation follow it again because I am satisfied that at one\r\n    point I could serve the FUEHRER as a tool in his work, even\r\n    though my former attitude even now gives occasion to very worthy\r\n    and honorable party comrades to doubt my trustworthiness. I have\r\n    never paid attention to such things because I am satisfied with\r\n    the opinion which the FUEHRER and the men close to him have of\r\n    me.” (_2210-PS_)\r\n\r\nA letter from Papen to Hitler dated 27 July 1935 shows how Papen thought\r\nthe doctrines of National Socialism could be used to effect the aim of\r\nAnschluss. It consists of a report entitled “Review and Outlook, One\r\nYear after the Death of Chancellor Dollfuss.” After reviewing the\r\nsuccess that the Austrian Government had had in establishing Dollfuss as\r\na martyr and his principles as the patriotic principles of Austria,\r\nPapen stated:\r\n\r\n    “National Socialism must and will overpower the new Austrian\r\n    ideology. If today it is contended in Austria that the NSDAP is\r\n    only a centralized Reich German party and therefore unable to\r\n    transfer the spirit of thought of National Socialism to groups\r\n    of people of a different political make-up, the answer must\r\n    rightly be that the national revolution in Germany could not\r\n    have been brought about in a different way. But when the\r\n    creation of the people’s community in the Reich will be\r\n    completed, National socialism could, in a much wider sense than\r\n    this is possible through the present party organization—at\r\n    least apparently—, certainly become the rallying point for all\r\n    racially German units beyond the borders. Spiritual progress in\r\n    regard to Austria cannot be achieved today with any centralized\r\n    tendency. If this recognition would once and for all be stated\r\n    clearly from within the Reich, then it would easily become\r\n    possible to effect a breakthrough into the front of the New\r\n    Austria. A Nurnberg Party Day designated as ‘The German Day’ as\r\n    in old times and the proclamation of a national socialistic\r\n    peoples’ front, would be a stirring event for all beyond the\r\n    borders of the Reich. Such attacks would win us also the\r\n    particularistic Austrian circles, whose spokesman, the\r\n    legitimistic Count Dubsky wrote in his pamphlet about the\r\n    ‘Anschluss’: The Third Reich will be with Austria, or it will\r\n    not be at all. National Socialism must win it or it will perish,\r\n    if it is unable to solve this task * * *.” (_2248-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther reports from Papen to Hitler, hereinafter mentioned, show that he\r\nmaintained covert contact with the National Socialist groups in Austria.\r\nFrom the very start of his mission Papen was thinking of ways and means\r\nof using the principle of National Socialism for “National Germans”\r\noutside the borders of Germany. Papen was working for Anschluss, and\r\nalthough he preferred to use the principles of National Socialism rather\r\nthan rely on the party organization, he was prepared to defend the party\r\norganization as a necessary means of establishing those principles in\r\nthe German Reich.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Assurances and Reassurances._ The German Government did more than\r\nkeep up a pretense of noninterference with Austrian groups. It employed\r\nthe psychological inducement of providing assurances that it had no\r\ndesigns on Austria’s independence. If Austria could but hope for the\r\nexecution of those assurances, she could find her way clear to the\r\ngranting of concessions, and obtain relief from the economic and\r\ninternal pressures.\r\n\r\nA letter from Papen, while in Berlin, to Hitler, dated 17 May 1935,\r\nindicated that a forthright, credible statement by Germany reassuring\r\nAustria would be most useful for German diplomatic purposes and the\r\nimprovement of relationships between Austria and German groups in\r\nAustria (_2247-PS_). Papen had a scheme for pitting Schuschnigg and his\r\nSocial-Christian forces against Starhemberg, the Vice-Chancellor of\r\nAustria, who was backed by Mussolini. He hoped to persuade Schuschnigg\r\nto ally his forces with the NSDAP in order to emerge victorious over\r\nStarhemberg. Papen indicated that he obtained this idea from Captain\r\nLeopold, leader of the illegal National Socialists. His letter states in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    “* * * I suggest that we take an active part in this game. The\r\n    fundamental idea should be to pit Schuschnigg and his\r\n    Christian-social Forces, who are opposed to a home front\r\n    dictatorship, against Starhemberg. The possibility of thwarting\r\n    the measures arranged between Mussolini and Starhemberg should\r\n    be afforded to him, in such way that he would submit the offer\r\n    to the government of a definitive German-Austrian compromise of\r\n    interests. According to the convincing opinion of the leader of\r\n    the NSDAP in Austria, Capt. Leopold, the totalitarian principle\r\n    of the NSDAP in Austria must be replaced in the beginning by a\r\n    combination of that part of the Christian-elements which favors\r\n    the Greater Germany idea and the NSDAP. If Germany recognizes\r\n    the national independence of Austria and guarantees full freedom\r\n    to the Austrian national opposition, then as a result of such a\r\n    compromise the Austrian government would be formed in the\r\n    beginning by a coalition of these forces. A further consequence\r\n    of this step would be the possibility of the participation of\r\n    Germany in the Danube pact, which would take the sting out of\r\n    its acuteness due to the settlement of relations between Germany\r\n    and Austria. Such a measure would have a most beneficial\r\n    influence on the European situation and especially on our\r\n    relationship with England. One may object, that Mr. Schuschnigg\r\n    will hardly be determined to follow such a pattern, that he will\r\n    rather in all probability immediately communicate our offer to\r\n    our opponents. Of course, one should first of all explore the\r\n    possibility of setting Schuschnigg against Starhemberg through\r\n    the use of ‘Go betweens’. The possibility exists. If Mr.\r\n    Schuschnigg finally says ‘No’ and makes our offer known in Rome,\r\n    then the situation would not be any worse but, on the contrary,\r\n    the efforts of the Reich government to make peace with Austria\r\n    would be revealed—without prejudice to other interests.\r\n    Therefore even in the case of refusal this last attempt would be\r\n    an asset. I consider it completely possible, that in view of the\r\n    far spread dislike of the Alpine countries of the pro-Italian\r\n    course and in view of the sharp tensions within the federal\r\n    government (_Bundesregierung_), Mr. Schuschnigg will grasp this\r\n    last straw—always under the supposition that the offer could\r\n    not be interpreted as a trap by the opponents, but that it bears\r\n    all the mark of an actually honest compromise with Austria.\r\n    Assuming success of this step, we would again establish our\r\n    active intervention in Central European politics, which, as\r\n    opposed to the French-Czech and Russian political maneuvers,\r\n    would be a tremendous success, both morally and practically.\r\n    Since there are 2 weeks left to accomplish very much work in the\r\n    way of explorations and Conferences, an immediate decision is\r\n    necessary. The Reich Army Minister (_Reichswehrminister_) shares\r\n    the opinion presented above and the Reich Foreign Minister\r\n    (_Reichsaussenminister_) wanted to discuss it with you my\r\n    Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n                                  (Signed)    Papen”. (_2247-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn other words, Papen wanted a strong assurance and credible assurance,\r\nof Austria’s independence. As he put it, Germany had nothing to lose\r\nwith what it could always call a mere effort at peace. And she might be\r\nable to convince Schuschnigg to establish an Austrian coalition\r\ngovernment with the NSDAP. If she did this, she would vastly strengthen\r\nher position in Europe. Finally, Papen urged haste.\r\n\r\nExactly four days later (21 May 1935) in a Reichstag address Hitler\r\nresponded to Papen’s suggestion, asserting:\r\n\r\n    “Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal\r\n    affairs of Austria, to annex Austria or to conclude an\r\n    Anschluss”. (_TC-26_)\r\n\r\nDespite this assurance, Papen suggested and Hitler announced, for a\r\ncomplexity of reasons, a policy completely at variance with their\r\nintentions, which had been and continued to be to interfere in Austria’s\r\ninternal affairs and to conclude an Anschluss.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Temporary Continuance of a Quiet Pressure Policy._ On 1 May 1936\r\nHitler branded as a lie any statement that tomorrow or the day after\r\nGermany would fall upon Austria. His words were published in the\r\n_Voelkische-Beobachter_, SD, 2-3 May 1936, p. 2. (_2367-PS_)\r\n\r\nIf Hitler meant what he said, it was only in the most literal and\r\nmisleading sense that he would not fall upon Austria “tomorrow or the\r\nday after”. For the conspirators well knew that the successful execution\r\nof their purpose required for a while longer the quiet policy they had\r\nbeen pursuing in Austria.\r\n\r\nA memorandum of a conversation which occurred when William Bullitt,\r\nAmerican Ambassador to France, called upon von Neurath, German Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, on 18 May 1936, recounts von Neurath’s explanation\r\nwhy Germany was trying to prevent rather than encourage an outbreak by\r\nthe Nazis in Austria (_L-150_). The Nazis were growing stronger in\r\nAustria, anyway, in view of their appeal to the young people. And the\r\nGerman Government was doing nothing active in foreign affairs until the\r\nRhineland, reoccupied two months before, had been “digested”, and until\r\nfortifications were constructed on the French frontier. Finally, Italy\r\nstill had a conflicting interest in Austria, and Germany wished to avoid\r\nany involvement with Italy.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _The agreement of 11 July 1936._ But if Germany was not yet ready\r\nfor open conflict in Austria, its diplomatic position was vastly\r\nimproved over 1934, a fact which influenced Austria’s willingness to\r\nmake concessions to Germany and come to terms. As Mr. Messersmith points\r\nout, Italy, formerly a protector of Austria, had embarked on her\r\nAbyssinian adventure, and this, together with the refortification of the\r\nRhineland, strengthened Germany’s position (_1760-PS_). This weakening\r\nof Austria helped pave the way for the Pact of 11 July 1936. (_TC-22_)\r\n\r\nThe formal part of the agreement of July 11, 1936, between the German\r\nGovernment and the Government of the Federal State of Austria, looks\r\nlike a great triumph for Austria. It contains a confusing provision to\r\nthe effect that Austria, in its policy, especially with regard to\r\nGermany, will regard herself as a German state. But the other two\r\nprovisions clearly state that Germany recognizes the full sovereignty of\r\nAustria, and that it regards the inner political order of Austria\r\n(including the question of Austrian National Socialism) as an internal\r\nconcern of Austria upon which it will exercise neither direct nor\r\nindirect influence.\r\n\r\nBut there was much more substance to the day’s events. Mr. Messersmith’s\r\nsummary, as set forth in his affidavit, is more revealing:\r\n\r\n    “Even more important than the terms of the agreement published\r\n    in the official communique, was the contemporaneous informal\r\n    understanding, the most important provisions of which were, that\r\n    Austria would (1) appoint a number of individuals enjoying the\r\n    Chancellor’s confidence but friendly to Germany to positions in\r\n    the Cabinet; (2) would devise means to give the ‘national\r\n    opposition’ a role in the political life of Austria and within\r\n    the framework of the Patriotic Front, and (3) would amnesty all\r\n    Nazis save those convicted of the most serious offenses. This\r\n    amnesty was duly announced by the Austrian Government and\r\n    thousands of Nazis were released, and the first penetration of\r\n    the _Deutsche Nationaler_ into the Austrian Government was\r\n    accomplished by the appointment of Dr. Guido Schmidt as\r\n    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and of Dr. Edmund\r\n    Glaise-Horstenau as Minister Without Portfolio”. (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese and other provisions of the secret part of the Agreement of July\r\n11 are set forth briefly and in general terms in an affidavit by Kurt\r\nSchuschnigg, former Chancellor of Austria, dated November 19, 1945\r\n(_2994-PS_). By two of those provisions Austria agreed to permit Nazi\r\norganizations on Austrian soil, and also use of the swastika and singing\r\nof the Horst Wessel song—all for German subjects. On its credit side,\r\nAustria was to get repeal of the 1,000 mark barrier on tourist trade,\r\nand in general tourist trade between the two countries was to resume.\r\n\r\nIn view of the strategy and tactics of the Nazis, these were substantial\r\nconcessions made by Austria to obtain Germany’s diplomatic, formal\r\nassurance of Austrian independence and non-intervention in Austrian\r\ninternal affairs. The release of imprisoned Nazis to the community\r\npresented potential police problems. And as Mr. Messersmith pointed out\r\nin a 1934 dispatch, quoted in his affidavit, any prospect that the\r\nNational Socialists might come to power would make it more difficult to\r\nobtain effective police and judicial action against the Nazis for fear\r\nof reprisals by the future Nazi Government against those taking action\r\nagainst Nazis even in the line of duty (_1760-PS_). The preservation of\r\ninternal peace in Austria was thus dependent upon Germany’s living up to\r\nits obligations under the Accord.\r\n\r\n(4) _Germany’s Continuing Program of Weakening the Austrian Government._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Germany’s Instructions to the Austrian National Socialists\r\nConcerning Future Plans._ In the pact of 11 July 1936 Germany agreed not\r\nto influence directly or indirectly the internal affairs of Austria,\r\nincluding the matter of Austrian National Socialism. On 16 July 1936,\r\njust five days later, Hitler violated that provision. The report of\r\nGauleiter Rainer to Reich Commissioner Buerckel states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * At that time the Fuehrer wished to see the leaders of the\r\n    party in Austria in order to tell them his opinion on what\r\n    Austrian National Socialists should do. Meanwhile Hinterleitner\r\n    was arrested, and Dr. Rainer became his successor and leader of\r\n    the Austrian party. On 16 July 1936, Dr. Rainer and Globocnik\r\n    visited the Fuehrer at the ‘Obersalzburg’ where they received a\r\n    clear explanation of the situation and the wishes of the\r\n    Fuehrer. On 17 July 1936, all illegal Gauleiters met in Anif\r\n    near Salzburg, where they received a complete report from Rainer\r\n    on the statement of the Fuehrer and his political instructions\r\n    for carrying out the fight. At the same conference the\r\n    Gauleiters received organizational instructions from Globocnik\r\n    and Hiedler.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Upon the proposal of Globocnik, the Fuehrer named Lt. Gen.\r\n    (Gruppenfuehrer) Keppler as chief of the mixed commission which\r\n    was appointed, in accordance with the state treaty of 11 July\r\n    1936, to supervise the correct execution of the agreement. At\r\n    the same time Keppler was given full authority by the Fuehrer\r\n    for the party in Austria. After Keppler was unsuccessful in his\r\n    efforts to cooperate with Leopold, he worked together with Dr.\r\n    Rainer, Globocnik, Reinthaller as leader of the peasants,\r\n    Kaltenbrunner as leader of the SS, and Dr. Jury as deputy-leader\r\n    of the Austrian party, as well as with Glaise-Horstenau and\r\n    Seyss-Inquart.” (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nA new strategy was developed for the Austrian Nazis. Mr. Messersmith\r\ndescribes it briefly in his affidavit:\r\n\r\n    “The sequel of the agreement was the only one which could have\r\n    been expected in view of all the facts and previous recorded\r\n    happenings. Active Nazi operations in Austria were resumed under\r\n    the leadership; of a certain Captain Leopold, who it was known\r\n    definitely was in frequent touch with Hitler. The Nazi program\r\n    was now to form an organization through which the Nazis could\r\n    carry on their operations openly and with legal sanction in\r\n    Austria. There were formed in Austria several organizations\r\n    which had a legal basis but which were simply a device by which\r\n    the Nazis in Austria could organize, and later seek inclusion as\r\n    a unit in the Patriotic Front. The most important of these was\r\n    the _Ostmarkischer Verein_, the sponsor of which was the\r\n    Minister of the Interior Glaise-Horstenau. Through the influence\r\n    of Glaise-Horstenau and the pro-Nazi Neustadter-Sturmer, this\r\n    organization was declared legal by the Courts. I made specific\r\n    mention of the foregoing because it shows the degree to which\r\n    the situation in Austria had disintegrated as a result of the\r\n    underground and open Nazi activities directed from Germany.”\r\n    (_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\nA report from Papen to Hitler dated 1 September 1936 indicates Papen’s\r\nstrategy after 11 July 1936 for destroying Austria’s independence. Papen\r\nhad taken a substantial step forward with the agreement of July 11.\r\nIncidentally, after that agreement he was promoted from Minister to\r\nAmbassador. Now his tactics were developed in the following terms, as\r\nexplained in the last three paragraphs of his letter of September 1:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The progress of normalizing relations with Germany at the\r\n    present time is obstructed by the continued persistence of the\r\n    Ministry of Security, occupied by the old anti-National\r\n    Socialistic officials. Changes in personnel are therefore of\r\n    utmost importance. But they are definitely not to be expected\r\n    prior to the conference on the abolishing of the Control of\r\n    Finances (Finanzkontrolle) at Geneva. The Chancellor of the\r\n    League has informed Minister de Glaise-Horstenau, of his\r\n    intention, to offer him the portfolio of the Ministry of the\r\n    Interior. As a guiding principle (Marschroute) I recommend on\r\n    the tactical side, continued, patient psychological treatment,\r\n    with slowly intensified pressure directed at changing the\r\n    regime. The proposed conference on economic relations, taking\r\n    place at the end of October, will be a very useful tool for the\r\n    realization of some of our projects. In discussion with\r\n    government officials as well as with leaders of the illegal\r\n    party (Leopold and Schattenfroh) who conform completely with the\r\n    agreement of July 11. I am trying to direct the next\r\n    developments in such a manner to aim at corporative\r\n    representation of the movement in the fatherland front\r\n    (Vaterlaendischen Front) but nevertheless refraining from\r\n    putting National Socialists in important positions for the time\r\n    being. However such positions are to be occupied only by\r\n    personalities, having the support and the confidence of the\r\n    movement. I have a willing collaborator in this respect in\r\n    Minister Glaise-Horstenau.\r\n\r\n                                                 (Signature) Papen”\r\n                                                        (_2246-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, this report of von Papen, discloses the following\r\nplans:\r\n\r\n    1. obtaining a change in personnel in Ministry of Security in\r\n    due course;\r\n\r\n    2. obtaining cooperative representation of the Nazi movement in\r\n    the Fatherland Front;\r\n\r\n    3. not putting avowed National Socialists in important positions\r\n    yet, but using “nationalist” personalities;\r\n\r\n    4. using economic pressure, and “patient psychological\r\n    treatment, with slowly intensified pressure directed at changing\r\n    the regime.”\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Nazi Demands and Demonstrations._ The Nazi demanded even more\r\nopen recognition. In January 1937 Captain Leopold submitted a memorandum\r\nof demands. They are listed in Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit (_1760-PS_).\r\nThey were not formally received by the Austrian Cabinet, but they were\r\nknown to and considered by the Cabinet. They included the following\r\ndemands: (1) An amnesty for all punishments or privations suffered for\r\nNational Socialist or National activity or sympathy; (2) equal treatment\r\nfor National Socialists, including freedom of political activity and\r\ncultural activity; (3) abolition of laws and sanctions used by the\r\nGovernment against Nazi activity. The memorandum advocated cooperation\r\non the basis of political principles including: A broadening of the\r\nPatriotic Front; changes in the Cabinet; an alliance with the Reich;\r\ncommon racial stock as a political aim; the application of anti-Semitic\r\nmeasures; and an early plebiscite on Anschluss.\r\n\r\nMr. Messersmith’s affidavit also states that these demands, and\r\nLeopold’s petition for a nationalistic party, were supported by frequent\r\ndemonstrations and much propaganda work. As early as 29 July 1936, when\r\nthe Olympic Torch was carried through Vienna, there were violent Nazi\r\ndisorders. From that time on there were frequent arrests for\r\ndistributing illegal literature or staging illegal demonstrations.\r\n(_1760-PS_)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Schuschnigg’s Concessions._ Gauleiter Rainer’s historical review\r\npoints out that due to the activities of the Reich officials and the\r\nAustrians who acted as the Nazi “fronts”, it was possible to obtain the\r\nappointment of Seyss-Inquart as _Staatsrat_ (Councillor of State) in\r\nJuly, 1937. (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchuschnigg’s affidavit mentions the Olympic Torch incident, and in\r\naddition the demonstration of the illegal Nazis at the time of the visit\r\nof von Neurath to Vienna in February 1937. Schuschnigg also points out\r\nother examples of the pressure increasingly exerted by Germany on\r\nAustria. One of his main reasons for entering into the July 11 agreement\r\nwas to eliminate Germany’s 1,000 mark penalty on tourists to Austria.\r\nThe penalty was removed, but Germany made it illegal for a tourist to\r\nbring more than 5 marks out of the country. And German buyers of cattle\r\nand wood purchased only from Austrian Nazis. (_2994-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchuschnigg further reports that the incidents and pressure culminated\r\nin the so-called Tavs Plan, discovered by the Austrian police in\r\nNovember, 1937, containing instructions for unrest to break out among\r\nthe Nazis at a prearranged time. The German Government would submit an\r\nultimatum that National Socialists must be brought into the Government\r\nor the German Army would invade. (_2994-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt may be recalled that during this period Schuschnigg made concessions.\r\nHe appointed Seyss-Inquart as Councillor of State in July, 1937. He had\r\npreviously appointed a “Committee of Seven” to discuss with him the\r\ndesires of the national opposition. He played a delaying game,\r\npresumably in the hope that a change in the foreign situation would\r\nprovide him with external support.\r\n\r\nB. _Germany’s Diplomatic Preparations for Conquest._\r\n\r\nThe program of the Nazi conspiracy aimed at weakening Austria externally\r\nand internally, by removing its support from without as well as by\r\npenetrating within. This program was of the utmost significance, since\r\nthe events of 25 July 1934 inside Austria were overshadowed by the fact\r\nthat Mussolini had brought his troops to the Brenner Pass and poised\r\nthem there as a strong protector of his northern neighbor.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, interference in the affairs of Austria, and steady increase\r\nin the pressure needed to acquire control over that country, required\r\nremoval of the possibility that Italy or any other country would come to\r\nAustria’s aid. But the program of the conspiracy for the weakening and\r\nisolation of Austria was integrated with its foreign policy program in\r\nEurope generally.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators’ diplomatic preparation for war is described in a\r\nsecond affidavit of George S. Messersmith (_2385-PS_), which may be\r\nsummarized as follows: In 1933 the Nazis openly acknowledged the\r\nambition to expand the territorial borders of the Reich to include\r\nAustria and Czechoslovakia. As for the other countries of Southeast\r\nEurope, the professed objective was stated at that time not in terms of\r\nterritorial acquisition but rather in terms of political and economic\r\ncontrol. And the stated objectives were not limited to Southeast Europe,\r\nfor important Nazis even in 1933 were stating their desire for the\r\nUkraine as the granary of Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to power, the Nazis had two principal objectives. They\r\nwanted to establish their power in Germany. And they wanted to rearm and\r\nestablish Germany’s armed power. They wanted peace until they were\r\nready. But they wanted to acquire the ability to carry out their program\r\nin Europe by force if necessary, although preferably by a threat of\r\nforce. They accordingly embarked upon their vast rearmament program. It\r\nproceeded very rapidly. Goering and General Milch often said to\r\nMessersmith or in his presence that the Nazis were concentrating on air\r\npower in their rearmament, as the weapon of terror most likely to give\r\nGermany a dominant position and the weapon which could be developed most\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to material preparation for war, there was preparation for\r\nwar in the psychological sense. Throughout Germany youth of all ages\r\ncould be observed in military exercises and field maneuvers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as Mr. Messersmith also observes,\r\n\r\n    “Military preparation and psychological preparation were coupled\r\n    with _diplomatic_ preparation designed to so disunite and\r\n    isolate their intended victims as to render them defenseless\r\n    against German aggression.” (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn 1933 the difficulties facing Germany in the political and diplomatic\r\nfield loomed large. France was the dominant military power on the\r\ncontinent. She had woven a system of mutual assistance in the West and\r\nin the East. The Locarno Pact of 1928, supplemented by the\r\nFranco-Belgian alliance, guaranteed the territorial status quo in the\r\nWest. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Rumania were allied in the Little\r\nEntente and each in turn was united with France by mutual assistance\r\npacts. Since 1922, France and Poland had likewise been allied against\r\nexternal aggression. Italy had made plain her special interest in\r\nAustrian independence.\r\n\r\nNazi Germany launched a vigorous diplomatic campaign to break up the\r\nexisting alliances and understandings, to create divisions among the\r\nmembers of the Little Entente and the other Eastern European powers.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Nazi Germany countered these alliances with promises of\r\neconomic gain for cooperating with Germans. To some of these countries\r\nshe offered extravagant promises of territorial and economic rewards.\r\nShe offered Carinthia, in Austria, to Yugoslavia. She offered part of\r\nCzechoslovakia to Hungary and part of Poland. She offered Yugoslav\r\nterritory to Hungary at the same time that she was offering land in\r\nHungary to Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Messersmith states in his affidavit:\r\n\r\n    “Austria and Czechoslovakia were the first on the German program\r\n    of aggression. As early as 1934, Germany began to woo neighbors\r\n    of these countries with promises of a share in the loot. To\r\n    Yugoslavia in particular they offered Carinthia. Concerning the\r\n    Yugoslav reaction, I reported at the time:\r\n\r\n        ‘* * * The major factor in the internal situation in the\r\n        last week has been the increase in tension with respect\r\n        to the Austrian Nazi refugees in Yugoslavia. * * * There\r\n        is very little doubt but that Goering, when he made his\r\n        trip to various capitals in Southeastern Europe about\r\n        six months ago, told the Yugoslavs that they would get a\r\n        part of Carinthia, when a National Socialist Government\r\n        came into power in Austria. * * * The Nazi seed sown in\r\n        Yugoslavia has been sufficient to cause trouble and\r\n        there are undoubtedly a good many people there who look\r\n        with a great deal of benevolence on those Nazi refugees\r\n        who went to Yugoslavia in the days following July 25.’\r\n\r\n    “Germany made like promises of territorial gains to Hungary and\r\n    to Poland in order to gain their cooperation or at least their\r\n    acquiescence in the proposed dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. As\r\n    I learned from my diplomatic colleagues in Vienna, von Papen and\r\n    von Mackensen in Vienna and in Budapest in 1935, were spreading\r\n    the idea of division of Czechoslovakia, in which division\r\n    Germany was to get Bohemia, Hungary to get Slovakia, and Poland\r\n    the rest. This did not deceive any of these countries for they\r\n    knew that the intention of Nazi Germany was to take all.\r\n\r\n    “The Nazi German Government did not hesitate to make\r\n    inconsistent promises when it suited its immediate objectives. I\r\n    recall the Yugoslav Minister in Vienna saying to me in 1934 or\r\n    1935, that Germany had made promises to Hungary of Yugoslav\r\n    territory while at the same time promising to Yugoslavs portions\r\n    of Hungarian territory. The Hungarian Minister in Vienna later\r\n    gave me the same information.\r\n\r\n    “I should emphasize here in this statement that the men who made\r\n    these promises were not only the died-in-the-wool Nazis but more\r\n    conservative Germans who already had begun to willingly lend\r\n    themselves to the Nazi program. In an official despatch to the\r\n    Department of State from Vienna dated October 10, 1935, I wrote\r\n    as follows:\r\n\r\n        ‘* * * Europe will not get away from the myth that\r\n        Neurath, Papen and Mackensen are not dangerous people\r\n        and that they are “diplomats of the old school.” They\r\n        are in fact servile instruments of the regime and just\r\n        because the outside world looks upon them as harmless,\r\n        they are able to work more effectively. They are able to\r\n        sow discord just because they propagate the myth that\r\n        they are not in sympathy with the regime.’” (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn other words, Nazi Germany was able to promote these divisions and\r\nincrease its own aggressive strength by using as its agents in making\r\nthese promises men who on outward appearances were merely conservative\r\ndiplomats. It is true that Nazis openly scoffed at any notion of\r\ninternational obligations. It is true that the real trump in Germany’s\r\nhand was its rearmament and more than that its willingness to go to war.\r\nAnd yet the attitude of the various countries was not influenced by\r\nthose considerations alone. Schuschnigg laid great stress upon, and was\r\nwilling to go to some lengths to obtain, an assurance of independence.\r\nAll these countries found it possible to believe apparently substantial\r\npersonages, like von Neurath, for example. They were led to rely on the\r\nassurances given, which seemed more impressive since the diplomats\r\nmaking them were represented as men who were not Nazis and would not\r\nstoop to go along with the base designs of the Nazis.\r\n\r\nGermany’s approach toward Great Britain and France was in terms of\r\nlimited expansion as the price of peace. They signed a naval limitations\r\ntreaty with England and discussed a Locarno Air Pact. In the case of\r\nboth France and England, they limited their statement of intentions and\r\nharped on fears of Communism and war.\r\n\r\nIn making these various promises, Germany was untroubled by notions of\r\nthe sanctity of international obligations. High-ranking Nazis, including\r\nGoering, Frick, and Frank, openly stated to Mr. Messersmith that Germany\r\nwould observe her international undertakings only so long as it suited\r\nGermany’s interests to do so. As Mr. Messersmith states in his\r\naffidavit:\r\n\r\n    “High-ranking Nazis with whom I had to maintain official\r\n    contact, particularly men such as Goering, Goebbels, Ley, Frick,\r\n    Frank, Darré and others, repeatedly scoffed at my position as to\r\n    the binding character of treaties and openly stated to me that\r\n    Germany would observe her international undertakings only so\r\n    long as it suited Germany’s interests to do so. Although these\r\n    statements were openly made to me as they were, I am sure, made\r\n    to others, these Nazi leaders were not really disclosing any\r\n    secret for on many occasions they expressed the same ideas\r\n    publicly.” (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrance and Italy worked actively in Southeastern Europe to counter\r\nGermany’s moves. France made attempts to promote an East Locarno Pact\r\nand to foster an economic accord between Austria and the other Danubian\r\npowers. Italy’s effort was to organize an economic bloc of Austria,\r\nHungary, and Italy.\r\n\r\nBut Germany foiled these efforts by redoubling its promises of loot, by\r\ncontinuing its armament, and by another significant stratagem. The Nazis\r\nstirred up internal dissensions to disunite and weaken their intended\r\nvictims. They supported the Austrian Nazis and the Henlein Party in\r\nCzechoslovakia. They probed what Goebbels called the “sore spots.” In\r\nYugoslavia they played on the differences between the Croats and the\r\nSerbs, and in particular played on the fear of the restoration of the\r\nHapsburgs in Austria, a fear which was very real in Yugoslavia. In\r\nHungary, Poland, and Rumania they stirred up other fears and hatreds.\r\nThese measures had considerable effect in preventing these countries\r\nfrom joining any which were opposed to German designs.\r\n\r\nThe Nazis consolidated their power in Germany very quickly. The German\r\npeople became increasingly imbued with the Nazi military spirit. Within\r\nGermany, resistance to the Nazis disappeared. Army officers, including\r\nmany who originally aided the Nazis with the limited objective of\r\nrestoring the German Army, increasingly became imbued with aggressive\r\ndesigns as they saw how remarkably their power was growing.\r\n\r\nThe power of Nazi Germany outside the borders of the Reich increased\r\ncorrespondingly. Other countries feared its military might. Important\r\npolitical leaders in Yugoslavia, in Hungary, and in Poland became\r\nconvinced that the Nazi regime would gain its ends and that the best\r\ncourse was to play along with Germany. These countries became apathetic\r\ntoward the development of Anschluss with Austria and cooperative toward\r\nthe dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Mr. Messersmith’s despatches from\r\nEurope to the State Department, setting out the developments in these\r\ncountries, are included in his second affidavit. (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs for Italy, Germany’s initial objective was to sow discord between\r\nYugoslavia and Italy, by promising Yugoslavia Italian territory,\r\nparticularly Trieste. This was to prevent France from reaching agreement\r\nwith them and to block an East Locarno Pact. As Mr. Messersmith states:\r\n\r\n    “While Italy openly opposed efforts at Anschluss with Austria in\r\n    1934, Italian ambitions in Abyssinia provided Germany with the\r\n    opportunity to sow discord between Italy and France and England,\r\n    and to win Italy over to acceptance of Germany’s program in\r\n    exchange for German support of Italy’s plans in Abyssinia.”\r\n    (_2385-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat paved the way for the Austro-German declaration of 11 July 1936.\r\nAnd in the Fall of 1936, Germany extended the hand of friendship and\r\ncommon purpose to Italy in an alliance—the Rome-Berlin Axis. This,\r\ntogether with Germany’s alliance with Japan, put increasing pressure on\r\nEngland and increased the relative strength of Germany.\r\n\r\nAnd so, by means of careful preparation in the diplomatic field, among\r\nothers, the Nazi conspirators had woven a position for themselves so\r\nthat they could seriously consider plans for war and outline a\r\ntimetable. That timetable was developed in the conference with Hitler in\r\nthe Reichschancellery on 5 November 1937. (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _Crystallization of the Plan to Wage Aggressive War in Europe and to\r\nSeize Austria and Czechoslovakia._\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the conspirators in the Reichschancellery on 5\r\nNovember 1937, the Fuehrer insisted that Germany should have more space\r\nin Europe (_386-PS_). It was concluded that the space required must be\r\ntaken by force, three different cases were outlined as possibilities,\r\nand it was decided that the problem would have to be solved before the\r\nperiod 1943 to 1945. The nature of a war in the near future was\r\nenvisaged, specifically against Austria and Czechoslovakia. Hitler said\r\nthat for the improvement of Germany’s military political position the\r\nfirst aim of the Nazis in every case of entanglement by war must be to\r\nconquer Czechoslovakia and Austria simultaneously, in order to remove\r\nany threat from the flanks in case of a possible advance Westwards.\r\nHitler then calculated that the conquest of Czechoslovakia and Austria\r\nwould constitute the conquest of food for from five to six million\r\npeople, assuming that the comprehensive emigration of one million from\r\nAustria could be carried out. He further pointed out that the annexation\r\nof the two states to Germany would constitute a considerable relief,\r\nboth militarily and politically, since they would provide shorter and\r\nbetter frontiers, would free fighting personnel for other purposes, and\r\nwould make possible the reconstitution of new armies. (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe minutes of this meeting reveal a crystallization in the policy of\r\nthe Nazi conspirators. It had always been their aim to acquire Austria.\r\nAt the outset a revolutionary Putsch was attempted, using the personnel\r\nof the Austrian Nazis, but that failed. The next period was one of\r\nsurface recognition of the independence of Austria and the use of\r\ndevious means to strengthen the position of the Nazis internally in\r\nAustria. Now, however, it became clear that the need for Austria, in the\r\nlight of the larger aggressive purposes of the Nazi conspirators, was\r\nsufficiently great to warrant the use of force in order to obtain\r\nAustria with the desired speed. The Nazis were, in fact, able to secure\r\nAustria, after having weakened it internally and removed from it the\r\nsupport of other nations, merely by setting the German military machine\r\nin motion and making a threat of force. The German armies were able to\r\ncross the border and secure the country without the necessity of firing\r\na shot. Careful planning for war and the readiness to use war as an\r\ninstrument of political action made it possible in the end for the Nazis\r\nto master Austria without having to fight for it.\r\n\r\nThe German High Command had previously considered preparations against\r\nAustria. On 24 June 1937 the Reich Minister for War and Commander in\r\nChief of the Armed Forces, General von Blomberg, issued a Top Secret\r\nDirective (_C-175_). The importance of this directive, establishing a\r\nunified preparation of the Armed Forces for war, is indicated by the\r\nfact that the carbon copy received by the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy\r\nwas one of only four copies. This directive from General von Blomberg\r\nstated that the general political situation indicated that Germany need\r\nnot consider an attack from any side, and also that Germany did not\r\nintend to unleash a European war. It then stated, in point 1:\r\n\r\n    “Nevertheless the politically fluid world situation, which does\r\n    not preclude surprising incidents, demands a continuous\r\n    preparedness for war of the German Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n        “_a._ to counter attacks at any time\r\n\r\n        “_b._ to enable the military exploitation of politically\r\n        favorable opportunities should they occur.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nThe directive then indicated that there would be certain preparations of\r\na general nature for war.\r\n\r\n        “2. The preparations of a general nature include:\r\n\r\n        “_a._ The permanent preparedness for mobilization of the\r\n        German Armed Forces, even before the completion of\r\n        rearmament and full preparedness for war.\r\n\r\n        “_b._ The further working on ‘Mobilization without\r\n        public announcement’ in order to put the Armed Forces in\r\n        a position to begin a war suddenly and by surprise both\r\n        as regards strength and time.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nThe directive finally indicated, in Part 3, that there might be special\r\npreparation for war in Austria:\r\n\r\n    “Armed intervention in Austria in the event of her restoring the\r\n    Monarchy.\r\n\r\n    “The object of this operation will be to compel Austria by armed\r\n    force to give up a restoration.\r\n\r\n    “Making use of the domestic political divisions of the Austrian\r\n    people, the march in will be made in the general direction of\r\n    Vienna and will break any resistance.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nThis plan is indicated in the document as having been superseded by new\r\nand more detailed plans following the meeting of November 5, 1937.\r\n\r\nThe plans of the conspirators were further revealed in two conversations\r\nheld by William Bullitt, United States Ambassador to France with Schacht\r\nand with Goering in November, 1937. Both Schacht and Goering told\r\nBullitt that Germany was determined to annex Austria. Goering further\r\nadded that there could be no final solution of the Sudeten-German\r\nquestion other than inclusion in the Reich. (_L-151_)\r\n\r\nD. _Pressure and Threats Resulting in Further Concessions:\r\nBerchtesgaden, 12 February 1938._\r\n\r\nChancellor Schuschnigg states in an affidavit (_2995-PS_) that in 1938\r\nvon Papen suggested to him that he should meet Hitler at Berchtesgaden.\r\nAfter several discussions Schuschnigg agreed to go, provided three\r\nconditions were met:\r\n\r\n    (1) He must be invited by Hitler.\r\n\r\n    (2) He must be previously informed of the precise agenda and assured\r\nthat the agreement of 11 July 1936 would be maintained.\r\n\r\n    (3) There was to be an agreement in advance that the communique to\r\nbe published at the end of the meeting would affirm the 11 July 1936\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nVon Papen brought back word from Hitler inviting Schuschnigg and\r\nagreeing with these conditions, particularly the maintenance of the July\r\n1936 treaty. (_2995-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe official German communique of this conference between Hitler and\r\nSchuschnigg at Obersalzberg on 12 February 1938 was calm (_2461-PS_).\r\nThe communique stated that the unofficial meeting was caused by the\r\nmutual desire to clarify by personal conversations the questions\r\nrelating to the relationship between the German Reich and Austria. The\r\ncommunique listed, as among those present, Schuschnigg and his Foreign\r\nMinister Schmidt, Hitler and his Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and von\r\nPapen. The communique concluded: “Both statesmen are convinced that the\r\nmeasures taken by them constitute at the same time an effective\r\ncontribution toward the peaceful development of the European situation.”\r\n(_2461-PS_). A similar communique was issued by the Austrian Government.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as a result of the conference great concessions were obtained\r\nby the German Government from Austria. The principal concessions are\r\ncontained in the official Austrian communique dated 16 February 1938\r\n(_2464-PS_). The communique announced a reorganization of the Austrian\r\nCabinet, including the appointment of Seyss-Inquart to the position of\r\nMinister of Security and Interior. In addition, announcement was made of\r\na general political amnesty to Nazis convicted of crimes. (_2464-PS_)\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on 18 February 1938, another concession was divulged in\r\nthe official German and Austrian communique concerning the equal rights\r\nof Austrian National Socialists in Austria (_2469-PS_). The communique\r\nannounced that pursuant to the Berchtesgaden conference, the Austrian\r\nNational Socialists would be taken into the Fatherland Front, the single\r\nlegal political party of Austria.\r\n\r\nSchuschnigg’s affidavit on his Berchtesgaden visit on February 12, 1938\r\n(_2995-PS_) points out that considerable pressure was brought to bear on\r\nhim at the Berghof. Several Generals—Keitel, Sperrle, and Reichenau,\r\nnames which were omitted from the formal communique later issued—were\r\npresent on his arrival. The conference started with a two-hour\r\nconference between Schuschnigg and Hitler alone. Hitler made no precise\r\ndemands but attacked Schuschnigg violently. In the words of the\r\naffidavit:\r\n\r\n    “I furthermore state and affirm that, immediately after arriving\r\n    at the Berghof, I commenced a conference with Hitler. Hitler and\r\n    I were alone for two hours. Hitler attacked in a violent manner\r\n    the politics of Austria, both of the past and present. He\r\n    furthermore informed me that he, Hitler, had ‘decided to bring\r\n    the Austrian question to a solution so-or-so, even if he had to\r\n    immediately use military force.’ At no time during the first two\r\n    hours of our conversation did Hitler ever make any precise\r\n    demands or requests of me, but spent the whole of the two hours\r\n    accusing me and menacing me as a traitor to Austrian politics.\r\n    Especially he informed me that, according to his knowledge,\r\n    Austria could no longer reckon with any assistance from other\r\n    European Powers, and that Austria now stood alone in the world.\r\n    He furthermore added—‘Schuschnigg, you now have the chance to\r\n    put your name alongside the names of other famous German\r\n    leaders, such as Goering, Hess, Frick, Epp, Goebbels, and\r\n    others.’ * * * “. (_2995-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter Hitler’s violent threats, Schuschnigg had discussions of a calmer\r\nnature with von Ribbentrop and von Papen. They talked soothingly and\r\ncomfortingly to Schuschnigg but reached the same conclusion, that he\r\nshould yield to German demands, which in practical effect meant Nazi\r\ncontrol of the Government of Austria.\r\n\r\n    “I furthermore state and affirm that I was next called before\r\n    Joachim von Ribbentrop with my Secretary for Foreign Affairs,\r\n    Guido Schmidt, and, in the presence of Franz von Papen,\r\n    Ribbentrop exhibited to me a typewritten draft containing the\r\n    conditions and demands made by Hitler upon me and Austria. He\r\n    furthermore added that Hitler has informed me, Ribbentrop, ‘that\r\n    these demands that I now offer to you are the final demands of\r\n    the Fuehrer and that he, Hitler, is not prepared to further\r\n    discuss them’. He further stated that, ‘you must accept the\r\n    whole of these demands herein contained’. Ribbentrop then\r\n    advised me to accept the demands at once. I protested, and\r\n    referred him to my previous agreements with von Papen, made\r\n    prior to coming to Berchtesgaden, and made it clear to\r\n    Ribbentrop that I was not prepared to be confronted with such\r\n    unreasonable demands as he had then and there placed before me.\r\n    Von Papen, still present, apologized and informed me that he,\r\n    von Papen, was entirely surprised and not at all informed about\r\n    the aims of the Fuehrer, as here laid down. He further stated,\r\n    and informed me, that he, von Papen, could only offer his advice\r\n    and that he should now accede to, and sign, these demands. He\r\n    furthermore informed me that I could be assured that Hitler\r\n    would take care that, if I signed these demands and acceded to\r\n    them, that from that time on Germany would remain loyal to this\r\n    Agreement and that there would be no further difficulties for\r\n    Austria.” (_2995-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, after obtaining some minor concessions from Ribbentrop,\r\nSchuschnigg met with Hitler again. This time Hitler not only put\r\npressure upon Schuschnigg, but also, upon learning that the approval of\r\nPresident Miklas of Austria was necessary, indicated clearly to\r\nSchuschnigg that military action would follow if Miklas did not approve\r\nthe agreement. In the words of Schuschnigg’s affidavit:\r\n\r\n    “I further state and say, that I then went before Hitler again.\r\n    Hitler was very excited and informed me that he would make a\r\n    final test with Austria, and stated further: ‘that you must\r\n    fulfill the conditions of the demands made by me on you within\r\n    three days, or else I will order the march into Austria.’ I\r\n    replied: ‘I am not able to take over the obligation to fulfill\r\n    your demands, for I am only the Chancellor of Austria, and that\r\n    obligation you attempt to place upon me is the duty only of the\r\n    Federal President, Miklas; I am only able to sign the draft and,\r\n    when I arrive in Vienna, to present it to the Federal\r\n    President’. Hitler then flung open the door and yelled ‘Keitel’.\r\n    At the same time, Hitler asked me to wait outside. Keitel then\r\n    came in to Hitler. After twenty minutes or more I was again\r\n    called before Hitler and, when before him, he, Hitler, informed\r\n    me as follows: ‘For the first time in my life, I have changed my\r\n    mind. You must sign the demands that I have made upon you, then\r\n    report them to the Federal President, Miklas, and within three\r\n    days from now Austria must fulfill the Agreement, otherwise\r\n    things will take their natural course’. I then agreed to sign\r\n    the demands and, while waiting in Hitler’s private room, he,\r\n    Hitler, in an entirely changed mood, said to Franz von Papen,\r\n    who was also present, ‘Herr von Papen, through your assistance I\r\n    was appointed Chancellor of Germany and thus the Reich was saved\r\n    from the abyss of communism. I will never forget that’. Papen\r\n    replied: ‘_Jawohl, Mein Fuehrer_’.\r\n\r\n    “I furthermore say and affirm that I, in the presence of\r\n    Ribbentrop, Guido Schmidt, von Papen, and Hitler, signed the\r\n    demands, and retained a copy for the Austrian Government. “I\r\n    further state and affirm that, on the way back to Vienna from\r\n    Berchtesgaden, Franz von Papen accompanied me and my party.\r\n    Between the Berghof and Berchtesgaden, von Papen informed me as\r\n    follows: ‘Now, you have your own impression of how excited the\r\n    Fuehrer can get, but that happens very seldom, and I am\r\n    convinced that the next time you meet him, you will have an\r\n    amicable conversation with him.’” (_2995-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe pressure put on Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden is also disclosed in\r\nvon Papen’s notes on his last meeting with Schuschnigg, on 26 February\r\n1938, the last two paragraphs of which read:\r\n\r\n    “I then introduced into the conversation the widespread opinion\r\n    that he had acted under ‘brutal pressure’ in Berchtesgaden. I\r\n    myself had been present and been able to state that he had\r\n    always and at every point had complete freedom of decision. The\r\n    Chancellor replied he had actually been under considerable moral\r\n    pressure, he could not deny that. He had made notes on the talk\r\n    which bore that out. I reminded him that despite this talk he\r\n    had not seen his way clear to make any concessions, and I asked\r\n    him whether without the pressure he would have been ready to\r\n    make the concessions he made late in the evening. He answered:\r\n    ‘To be honest, no!’ It appears to me of importance to record\r\n    this statement.” (_1544-PS_)\r\n\r\nFor diplomatic purposes von Papen, who had been at Berchtesgaden, kept\r\nup the pretense that there had been no pressure. But General Jodl,\r\nwriting the account of current events for his diary, was more candid.\r\nThis hand-written diary discloses not only the pressure at Berchtesgaden\r\nbut also the fact that for some days thereafter, General Keitel and\r\nAdmiral Canaris worked out a scheme for shamming military pressure, in\r\norder to coerce President Miklas into ratifying the agreement. And so\r\nthe Nazi conspirators kept up the military pressure, with threats of\r\ninvasion, for some days after the Berchtesgaden conference, in order to\r\nproduce the desired effect on Miklas. (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe following entries, for Feb. 11-Feb. 14 were made in Jodl’s diary:\r\n\r\n    “_11 February_:\r\n\r\n    “In the evening and on 12 February General K. with General V.\r\n    Reichenau and Sperrle at the Obersalzberg. Schuschnigg together\r\n    with G. Schmidt are again being put under heaviest political and\r\n    military pressure. At 2300 hours Schuschnigg signs protocol.\r\n\r\n    “_13 February_:\r\n\r\n    “In the afternoon General K. asks Admiral C. and myself to come\r\n    to his apartment. He tells us that the Fuehrer’s order is to the\r\n    effect that military pressure by shamming military action should\r\n    be kept up until the 15th. Proposals for these deceptive\r\n    maneuvers are drafted and submitted to the Fuehrer by telephone\r\n    for approval.\r\n\r\n    “_14 February_:\r\n\r\n    “At 2:40 o’clock the agreement of the Fuehrer arrives. Canaris\r\n    went to Munich to the Counter-Intelligence office VII and\r\n    initiates the different measures.\r\n\r\n    “The effect is quick and strong. In Austria the impression is\r\n    created that Germany is undertaking serious military\r\n    preparations.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\n    The proposals for deceptive maneuvers mentioned by Jodl were\r\n    signed by Keitel. Underneath his signature appeared a pencilled\r\n    note that the Fuehrer approved the proposals. Among the rumors\r\n    which Keitel proposed for the intimidation of Austria were the\r\n    following:\r\n\r\n    “1. To take no real preparatory measures in the Army or\r\n    Luftwaffe. No troop movements or redeployments.\r\n\r\n    “2. Spread false, but quite credible news, which may lead to the\r\n    conclusion of military preparations against Austria.\r\n\r\n        “_a._ through V-men (V-Maenner) in Austria,\r\n\r\n        “_b._ through our customs personnel (staff) at the\r\n        frontier,\r\n\r\n        “_c._ through travelling agents.\r\n\r\n    “3. Such news could be:\r\n\r\n        “_a._ Furloughs are supposed to have been barred in the\r\n        Sector of the VII A.K.\r\n\r\n        “_b._ (Rolling Stock) is being assembled in Munich,\r\n        Augsburg, and Regensburg.\r\n\r\n        “_c._ Major General Muff, the Military Attache in Vienna\r\n        has been called for a conference to Berlin. (As a matter\r\n        of fact, this is the case).\r\n\r\n        “_d._ The Police Stations located at the frontier of\r\n        Austria, have called up reinforcements.\r\n\r\n        “_e._ Custom officials report about the imminent\r\n        maneuvers of the Mountain Brigade (_Gebirgsbrigade_) in\r\n        the region of Freilassing, Reichenhall and\r\n        Berchtesgaden.” (_1775-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe pattern of intimidation and rumor was effective, for in due course,\r\nas is shown in the communiques already referred to, President Miklas\r\nratified the Berchtesgaden agreement, which foreshadowed a National\r\nSocialist Austria.\r\n\r\nE. _Events Culminating in the German Invasion on 12 March 1938._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Plebiscite._ The day after his appointment as Minister of the\r\nInterior, Seyss-Inquart flew to Berlin for a conference with Hitler.\r\n(_2484-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 9 March 1938, three weeks after Seyss-Inquart had been put in charge\r\nof the police, Schuschnigg announced that he would hold a plebiscite\r\nthroughout Austria on the following Sunday, 13 March 1938. The question\r\nwas: “Are you for an independent and social, a Christian, German and\r\nunited Austria?” A “yes” answer to this question was clearly compatible\r\nwith the agreement made by the German Government on 11 July 1936, and\r\ncarried forward at Berchtesgaden on 12 February 1938. Moreover, for a\r\nlong while the Nazis had been demanding a plebiscite on the question of\r\nAnschluss. But the Nazis apparently appreciated the likelihood of a\r\nstrong “yes” vote on the question put by Schuschnigg, and they could not\r\ntolerate the possibility of such a vote of confidence in the Schuschnigg\r\nGovernment. They took this occasion to overturn the Austrian Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Plebiscite was not announced until the evening of 9 March,\r\nthe Nazi Organization received word about it earlier in the day. It was\r\ndetermined by the Nazis that they had to ask Hitler what to do about the\r\nsituation, and that they would prepare a letter of protest against the\r\nPlebiscite from Seyss-Inquart to Schuschnigg, and that pending Hitler’s\r\napproval, Seyss-Inquart would pretend to negotiate with Schuschnigg\r\nabout details of the plebiscite.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Gauleiter Rainer’s report to Reichscommissioner\r\nBuerckel:\r\n\r\n    “The _Landesleitung_ received word about the planned plebiscite\r\n    through illegal information services, on 9 March 1938 at 10 a.\r\n    m. At the session which was called immediately afterwards,\r\n    Seyss-Inquart explained that he had known about this for only a\r\n    few hours, but that he could not talk about it because he had\r\n    given his word to keep silent on this subject. But during the\r\n    talks he made us understand that the illegal information we\r\n    received was based on truth, and that in view of the new\r\n    situation, he had been cooperating with the _Landesleitung_ from\r\n    the very first moment. Klausner, Jury, Rainer, Globocnik and\r\n    Seyss-Inquart were present at the first talks which were held at\r\n    10 a. m. There it was decided that first, the Fuehrer had to be\r\n    informed immediately; secondly, the opportunity for the Fuehrer\r\n    to intervene must be given to him by way of an official\r\n    declaration made by Minister Seyss-Inquart to Schuschnigg; and\r\n    thirdly, Seyss-Inquart must negotiate with the government until\r\n    clear instructions and orders were received from the Fuehrer.\r\n    Seyss-Inquart and Rainer together composed a letter to\r\n    Schuschnigg, and only one copy of it was brought to the Fuehrer\r\n    by Globocnik, who flew to him on the afternoon of 9 March 1938.”\r\n    (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Germany’s Preparation for the Use of Force._ When news of the\r\nPlebiscite reached Berlin, it started a tremendous amount of activity.\r\nHitler was determined not to tolerate the plebiscite. Accordingly, he\r\ncalled his military advisers and ordered preparation for the march into\r\nAustria. He made diplomatic preparations by explaining in a letter to\r\nMussolini the reasons why he was going to march into Austria. In the\r\nabsence of von Ribbentrop, who was temporarily detained in London, von\r\nNeurath took over the affairs of the Foreign Office again.\r\n\r\nThe terse and somewhat disconnected notes in General Jodl’s diary give a\r\nvivid account of the activity in Berlin. The entry for the 10th of March\r\n1938 reads:\r\n\r\n    “By surprise and without consulting his ministers, Schuschnigg\r\n    ordered a plebiscite for Sunday, 13, March, which should bring\r\n    strong majority for the Legitimists in the absence of plan or\r\n    preparation.\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer is determined not to tolerate it. The same night, March\r\n    9 to 10, he calls for Goering. General v. Reichenau is called\r\n    back from Cairo Olympic Committee. General v. Schebert is\r\n    ordered to come, as well as Minister Glaise Horstenau, who is\r\n    with the District leader (_Gauleiter_) Buerckel in the\r\n    Palatinate. General Keitel communicates the facts at 1:45. He\r\n    drives to the Reichskanzlei at 10 o’clock. I follow at 10:15,\r\n    according to the wish of General v. Viebahn, to give him the old\r\n    draft.\r\n\r\n    “Prepare case Otto.\r\n\r\n    “1300 hours: General K informs Chief of Operational Staff (and)\r\n    Admiral Canaris. Ribbentrop is being detained in London. Neurath\r\n    takes over the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer wants to transmit ultimatum to the Austrian Cabinet. A\r\n    personal letter is dispatched to Mussolini and the reasons are\r\n    developed which force the Fuehrer to take action.\r\n\r\n    “1830 hours: Mobilization order is given to the Command of the\r\n    8th Army (Corps Area 3) 7th and 13th Army Corps; without reserve\r\n    Army.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a directive of the Supreme High Command of the Armed Forces, dated 11\r\nMarch 1938 and initialed by Jodl and Keitel, Hitler stated his mixed\r\npolitical and military intentions:\r\n\r\n    “1. If these measures prove unsuccessful, I intend to invade\r\n    Austria with armed forces to establish constitutional conditions\r\n    and to prevent further outrages against the pro-German\r\n    population.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “4. The forces of the Army and Air Force detailed for this\r\n    operation must be ready for invasion and/or ready for action on\r\n    the 12th of March 1938 at the latest from 1200 hours.\r\n\r\n    “I reserve the right to give permission for crossing and flying\r\n    over the frontier, and to decide the actual moment for invasion.\r\n\r\n    “5. The behavior of the troops must give the impression that we\r\n    do not want to wage war against our Austrian brothers. It is in\r\n    our interest that the whole operation shall be carried out\r\n    without any violence but in the form of a peaceful entry\r\n    welcomed by the population. Therefore any provocation is to be\r\n    avoided. If, however, resistance is offered it must be broken\r\n    ruthlessly by force of arms.” (_C-102_)\r\n\r\nAn implementing directive of 11 March 1938 issued by Jodl provided\r\nfurther:\r\n\r\n    “If Czechoslovakian troops or militia units are encountered in\r\n    Austria, they are to be regarded as hostile.\r\n\r\n    “The Italians are everywhere to be treated as friends especially\r\n    as Mussolini has declared himself uninterested in the solution\r\n    of the Austrian Question”. (_C-103_)\r\n\r\nThe military preparations for invasion were complete.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Events of 11 March in Austria._ The events of 11 March 1938 in\r\nAustria are available in three separate accounts. Although these\r\naccounts differ in some minor details, they afford each other almost\r\ncomplete corroboration with regard to the way in which the German\r\nGovernment deprived Austria of its sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe first account is contained in a third affidavit executed by\r\nSchuschnigg (_2996-PS_). Schuschnigg first states that he had been\r\ndiscussing the plebiscite with Seyss-Inquart, and that Seyss-Inquart had\r\nmade some procedural objections but in general indicated his general\r\nwillingness to support the plebiscite. Schuschnigg went to bed on March\r\n10 thinking the plebiscite would be a success. But on the morning of\r\nMarch 11 he was told that traffic from Germany had stopped, and that\r\nGerman Army forces were moving to the border. After 10 a. m.\r\nSeyss-Inquart came to Schuschnigg’s office with Glaise-Horstenau.\r\nGlaise-Horstenau had just come from Berlin and reported that Hitler was\r\nin a rage. (_2996-PS_)\r\n\r\nSchuschnigg’s affidavit then relates the three ultimatums presented by\r\nthe German Government:\r\n\r\n    “Seyss-Inquart was then and there called to the telephone and,\r\n    upon his return, read to me from a scrap of paper which he held\r\n    in his hand, the contents of a telephone call which he alleged\r\n    was just then received by him from Goering in Berlin. The\r\n    contents as he read it to me was as follows: ‘The Chancellor\r\n    must revoke the proposed plebiscite within the time of one hour,\r\n    and after three or four weeks, Austria must oblige herself to\r\n    carry out a plebiscite concerning the Anschluss according to the\r\n    SAAR status, otherwise the German Army is ordered to pass the\r\n    Austrian frontier’.\r\n\r\n    “I further state and say that after informing the Federal\r\n    President of this demand made on Austria by Germany, we decided\r\n    to recall the Plebiscite, and thereupon I informed Seyss-Inquart\r\n    and Glaise-Horstenau of our intentions.\r\n\r\n    “Seyss-Inquart said that he would go to the telephone and inform\r\n    Goering in Berlin concerning the decision of the Austrian\r\n    Government, at that time made. In a few minutes, he,\r\n    Seyss-Inquart, returned to my office, and informed me further,\r\n    as follows:\r\n\r\n        ‘I have had a telephone conversation with Goering, and\r\n        Goering has ordered me to inform the Federal Chancellor\r\n        Schuschnigg, as follows:\r\n\r\n        ‘“The situation can only be saved for Austria when\r\n        Schuschnigg resigns as the Chancellor of Austria within\r\n        two hours and Seyss-Inquart is appointed as the new\r\n        Chief of the Austrian Government; if Seyss-Inquart does\r\n        not inform me, Goering, within two hours, I, Goering,\r\n        will suppose that you are hindered from doing so”’.\r\n\r\n    “I then reported to the Federal President the new developments,\r\n    and, after some conversation with him and other members of the\r\n    Government, I decided to resign. The Federal President\r\n    reluctantly accepted my resignation at 3:30 p. m. on the\r\n    afternoon of the 11th of March 1938. He expressed himself\r\n    unwilling to appoint Seyss-Inquart as the Federal Chancellor—he\r\n    therefore asked me to continue my duties as caretaker Chancellor\r\n    until he had decided who would succeed me as Federal Chancellor.\r\n    I accepted and remained as ‘caretaker Chancellor’ from 3:30 p.\r\n    m., 11 March 1938 until about 11:30 p. m. the same night, when\r\n    Seyss-Inquart was appointed to the position of Federal\r\n    Chancellor.\r\n\r\n    “I further state and say that at about 3:30 p. m. on the\r\n    afternoon of 11 March 1938, the Foreign Office of the Austrian\r\n    Government contacted the Embassy of Germany in Vienna, to\r\n    ascertain if the demands that had been then and there made by\r\n    Goering on Austria were the official demands of the German\r\n    Government. The Military Attache of Germany in Vienna, one\r\n    Lieutenant General Muff, came before the Austrian Federal\r\n    President, and repeated the contents of the German ultimatums\r\n    that had previously been delivered to us by Seyss-Inquart.\r\n\r\n    “I furthermore state and say, that the Federal President, at\r\n    about 7:30 or 8:00 o’clock p. m. on the night of 11 March 1938\r\n    ordered me, as caretaker Chancellor, to broadcast the events of\r\n    the day and to protest against the demands made on Austria\r\n    during that day by Germany. Furthermore, to inform the world\r\n    that Austria had been forced to give in to those demands of\r\n    Germany through superior force * * *.” (_2996-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report from Gauleiter Rainer to Reichscommissioner Buerckel also\r\ndiscusses the events of March 11. In general, Rainer’s report\r\ncorroborates Schuschnigg’s affidavit. (_812-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother document recalls vividly the events of 11 March 1938. This\r\ndocument, which was found in a building of the courtyard of the German\r\nAir Ministry, is a binder containing typed transcripts of some 27\r\ntelephone conversations, held in Goering’s office in the Air Ministry on\r\n11 March 1938 and up to 14 March 1938. Most of the conversations were\r\nconducted by Goering, although at least one was held by Hitler\r\n(_2949-PS_). (For purposes of convenience these telephone calls are\r\nmarked with an identifying letter, running from A through Z and then\r\nbeginning again with AA).\r\n\r\nThe first group of conversations took place between Field Marshal\r\nGoering, who was identified as F., and Seyss-Inquart, who was identified\r\nas S. The transcript is in part, in the language of these two persons\r\nand is in part a summary of the actual conversations. At 2:45 p. m. the\r\nfollowing conversation occurred:\r\n\r\n    “F: How do you do, doctor. My brother-in-law, is he with you?\r\n\r\n    “S: No.\r\n\r\n    “Thereupon the conversation took approximately the following\r\n    turn:\r\n\r\n    “F: How are things with you? Have you resigned, or do you have\r\n    any news?\r\n\r\n    “S. The Chancellor has cancelled the elections for Sunday, and\r\n    therefore he has put S. and the other gentlemen in a difficult\r\n    situation. Besides having called off the elections, extensive\r\n    precautionary measures are being ordered, among others curfew at\r\n    8 p. m.\r\n\r\n    “F: Replied that in his opinion the measures taken by Chancellor\r\n    Schuschnigg were not satisfactory in any respect. At this moment\r\n    he could not commit himself officially. F. will take a clear\r\n    stand very shortly. In calling off the elections, he could see a\r\n    postponement only, not a change of the present situation which\r\n    had been brought about by the behavior of the Chancellor\r\n    Schuschnigg in breaking the Berchtesgaden agreement.\r\n\r\n    “Thereupon a conversation took place between F. and the Fuehrer.\r\n    Afterwards F. phoned again S. This conversation was held at\r\n    15:05.\r\n\r\n    “F: Told S. that Berlin did not agree whatsoever with the\r\n    decision made by Chancellor Schuschnigg since he did not enjoy\r\n    any more the confidence of our government because he had broken\r\n    the Berchtesgaden agreement, and therefore further confidence in\r\n    his future actions did not exist. Consequently, the National\r\n    Minister, S. and the others, are being requested to immediately\r\n    hand in their resignation to the Chancellor, and also to ask the\r\n    Chancellor to resign. F. added that if after a period of one\r\n    hour no report had come through the assumption would be made\r\n    that S. would no more be in the position to phone. That would\r\n    mean that the gentlemen had handed in their resignations. S. was\r\n    then told to send the telegram to the Fuehrer as agreed upon. As\r\n    a matter of course, an immediate commission by the Federal\r\n    President for S. to form a new cabinet would follow\r\n    Schuschnigg’s resignation.” (_2949-PS, Part A_)\r\n\r\nThus Goering told Seyss-Inquart that it was not enough for Schuschnigg\r\nto cancel the election. And twenty minutes later he telephoned\r\nSeyss-Inquart to state that Schuschnigg must resign. When informed at\r\nabout an hour later that Schuschnigg had resigned, he pointed out that\r\nin addition it was necessary to have Seyss-Inquart at the head of the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Goering phoned Dombrowski at the German Embassy in Vienna.\r\nHe was concerned that the Nazi Party and all its formations should be\r\nlegalized promptly:\r\n\r\n    “Goering: Now to go on. The Party has definitely been legalized?\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: But that is * * * it isn’t necessary to even\r\n    discuss that.\r\n\r\n    “Goering: With all of its organizations.\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: With all of its organizations within this country.\r\n\r\n    “Goering: In uniform?\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: In uniform.\r\n\r\n    “Goering: Good.\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: calls attention to the fact that the SA and SS have\r\n    already been on duty for one-half hour which means everything is\r\n    all right.” (_2949-PS, Part C_)\r\n\r\nIn addition Goering stated that the Cabinet must be formed by 7:30 p.\r\nm., and he transmitted instructions, to be delivered to Seyss-Inquart,\r\nas to who should be appointed to the cabinet:\r\n\r\n    “Goering: Yes, and by 7:30 he also must talk with the Fuehrer\r\n    and as to the Cabinet, Keppler will bring you the names. One\r\n    thing I have forgotten, Fishbeck must have the Department of\r\n    Economy and Commerce.\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: That’s understood.\r\n\r\n    “Goering: Kaltenbrunner is to have the Department of Security\r\n    and Bahr is to have the armed forces. The Austrian Army is to be\r\n    taken by Seyss-Inquart himself and you know all about the\r\n    Justice Department.\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: Yes, yes.\r\n\r\n    “Goering: Give me the name.\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: Well, your brother-in-law. Isn’t that right?\r\n\r\n    “Goering: Yes?\r\n\r\n    “Dombrowski: Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Goering: That’s right and then also Fishbeck.” (_2949-PS, Part\r\n    C_)\r\n\r\nAbout twenty minutes later, at 5:26 p. m., Goering received the news\r\nthat Miklas was refusing to appoint Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor. He\r\nissued instructions for an ultimatum to be delivered to Miklas. The\r\ntelephone conversation between Goering and Seyss-Inquart went as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “G: Now remember the following: You go immediately together with\r\n    Lt. General Muff and tell the Federal President that if the\r\n    conditions which are known to you are not accepted immediately,\r\n    the troops who are already stationed at and advancing to the\r\n    frontier will march in tonight along the whole line, and Austria\r\n    will cease to exist. Lt. General Muff should go with you and\r\n    demand to be admitted for conference immediately. Please, do\r\n    inform us immediately about Miklas’ position. Tell him, there is\r\n    no time now for any joke. Just through the false report we\r\n    received before action was delayed, but now the situation is\r\n    that tonight the invasion will begin from all the corners of\r\n    Austria. The invasion will be stopped and the troops will be\r\n    held at the border only if we are informed by 7:30 that Miklas\r\n    has entrusted you with the Federal Chancellorship. (There\r\n    follows a sentence which is broken up) M. does not matter\r\n    whatever it might be, the immediate restoration of the Party\r\n    with all its organizations (again interruption) and then call\r\n    out all the National Socialists all over the country. They\r\n    should now be in the streets. So remember, report must be given\r\n    till 7:30. Lt. General Muff is supposed to come along with you.\r\n    I shall inform him immediately. If Miklas could not understand\r\n    it in 4 hours, we shall make him understand it now in 4\r\n    minutes.” (_2949-PS, Part E_)\r\n\r\nAn hour later, at 6:28 p. m. Goering had an extensively interrupted\r\ntelephone conversation with Keppler and Muff and Seyss-Inquart. When\r\ntold that Miklas had refused to appoint Seyss-Inquart, Goering replied:\r\n\r\n    “Goering: Well, then Seyss-Inquart has to dismiss him; just go\r\n    upstairs again and just tell him plainly that SI shall call on\r\n    the National Socialists guard, and in 5 minutes the troops will\r\n    march in by my order”. (_2949-PS, Part H_)\r\n\r\nAfter an interruption, Seyss-Inquart came to the telephone and informed\r\nGoering that Miklas was still sticking to his old viewpoint, although a\r\nnew person had gone in to talk to him and there might be definite word\r\nin about ten minutes. The conversation proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “G: Listen, so I shall wait a few more minutes, till he comes\r\n    back, then you inform me via Blitz conversation in the Reich\r\n    Chancellery—as usually, but it has to be done fast. I hardly\r\n    can justify it as a matter of fact. I am not entitled to do so;\r\n    if it cannot be done, then you have to take over the power; all\r\n    right?\r\n\r\n    “S. But if he threatens?\r\n\r\n    “G. Yes.\r\n\r\n    “S. Well, I see, then we shall be ready (_antreten_).\r\n\r\n    “G. Call me via Blitz.” (_2949-PS, Part H_)\r\n\r\nIt is plain that Goering and Seyss-Inquart had agreed on a plan for\r\nSeyss-Inquart to take over power if Miklas remained obdurate. The plan\r\ninvolved both the use of the National Socialist forces in Austria and\r\ninvasion by German troops.\r\n\r\nLater that night, at about 8:00 o’clock, Goering and Seyss-Inquart had\r\nanother conversation. This was after the ultimatum had expired.\r\nSeyss-Inquart informed Goering that Miklas was still refusing to name\r\nSeyss-Inquart as Chancellor. The conversation then proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “G: O.K. I shall give the order to march in and then you make\r\n    sure that you get the power. Notify the leading people about the\r\n    following which I shall tell you now! Everyone who offers\r\n    resistance or organizes resistance, will immediately be\r\n    subjected to our court-martial, the court-martial of our\r\n    invading troops. Is that clear?\r\n\r\n    “S: Yes.\r\n\r\n    “G: Including leading personalities, it doesn’t make any\r\n    difference.\r\n\r\n    “S: Yes, they have given the order, not to offer any resistance.\r\n\r\n    “G: Yes, it does not matter: The Federal President did not\r\n    authorize you, and that also can be considered as resistance.\r\n\r\n    “S: Yes.\r\n\r\n    “G: Well, now you are officially authorized.\r\n\r\n    “S: Yes.\r\n\r\n    “G: Well, good luck, Heil Hitler.” (_2349-PS, Part I_)\r\n\r\nAnother historical event—the famous telegram which Seyss-Inquart sent\r\nto the German Government requesting it to send troops into Austria to\r\nhelp put down disorder—was discussed over the telephone. A conversation\r\nheld at 8:48 between Goering and Keppler proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “G: Well, I do not know yet. Listen: The main thing is, that\r\n    Inquart takes over all powers of the Government, that he keeps\r\n    the radio stations occupied.\r\n\r\n    “K: Well, we represent the Government now.\r\n\r\n    “G: Yes, that’s it. You are the Government. Listen carefully:\r\n    The following telegram should be sent here by Seyss-Inquart.\r\n    Take the notes:\r\n\r\n        ‘The provisional Austrian Government which after the\r\n        dismissal of the Schuschnigg Government, consider it its\r\n        task to establish peace and order in Austria, sends to\r\n        the German Government the urgent request, to support it\r\n        in its task and to help it to prevent bloodshed. For\r\n        this purpose it asks the German Government to send\r\n        German troops as soon as possible’.\r\n\r\n    “K: Well, SA and SS are marching through the streets, but\r\n    everything is quiet. Everything has collapsed with the\r\n    professional groups (?)” (_2949-PS, Part L_)\r\n\r\nAnd a few minutes later the conversation continued as follows:\r\n\r\n    “G: Then our troops will cross the border today.\r\n\r\n    “K: Yes.\r\n\r\n    “G: Well, and he should send the telegram as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n    “K: Will send the telegram to SI in the office of the Federal\r\n    Chancery.\r\n\r\n    “G: Please, show him, the text of the telegram and do tell him\r\n    that we are asking him—well, he does not even have to send the\r\n    telegram—all he needs to do is to say: agreed.\r\n\r\n    “K: Yes.\r\n\r\n    “G: Either call me at the Fuehrer’s or at my place. Well, good\r\n    luck. Heil Hitler!” (_2949-PS, Part L_)\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in the first conversation (Part A), held at\r\n3:05 p. m., Goering had requested Seyss-Inquart to send the telegram\r\nagreed upon. But now the matter was so urgent that Goering dictated the\r\nexact wording of the telegram over the telephone.\r\n\r\nAnd an hour later, at 9:54 p. m., a conversation between Dr. Dietrich in\r\nBerlin and Keppler in Vienna went as follows:\r\n\r\n    “D: I need the telegram urgently.\r\n\r\n    “K: Tell the General Field Marshal that Seyss-Inquart agrees.\r\n\r\n    “D: This is marvelous. Thank you.\r\n\r\n    “K: Listen to the radio. News will be given.\r\n\r\n    “D: Where?\r\n\r\n    “K: From Vienna.\r\n\r\n    “D: So Seyss-Inquart agrees?\r\n\r\n    “K: _Jawohl!_” (_2949-PS, Part M_)\r\n\r\n(4) _The Order to Invade Austria._ Communications with Austria were now\r\nsuspended. But the German military machine had been set in motion. A\r\nDirective, dated 11 March 1938 at 2045 hours, from Supreme Commander of\r\nthe Armed Forces, initialled by General Jodl and signed by Hitler,\r\nordered the invasion of Austria because of its failure to comply with\r\nthe German ultimatum. The directive reads:\r\n\r\n    “Re: Operation Otto\r\n\r\n                           “_Directive No. 2_\r\n\r\n    “1. The demands of the German ultimatum to the Austrian\r\n    government have not been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Austrian Armed Forces have been ordered to withdraw in\r\n    front of the entry of German troops and to avoid fighting.\r\n\r\n    “The Austrian Government has ceased to function of its own\r\n    accord.\r\n\r\n    “3. To avoid further bloodshed in Austrian towns, the entry of\r\n    the German Armed Forces into Austria will commence, according to\r\n    directive No. 1, at daybreak on 12.3.\r\n\r\n    “I expect the set objectives to be reached by exerting all\r\n    forces to the full, as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n                                  (signed)  ADOLF HITLER” (_C-182_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Communications with Rome—Avoidance of Disaster._ But at the very\r\ntime that Hitler and Goering had embarked on this military undertaking,\r\nthey still had a question mark in their minds—Italy. Italy had massed\r\nforces on the Italian-Austrian border on the occasion of the 25 July\r\n1934 putsch. Italy had traditionally been the political protector of\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nAt 10:25 p. m. that evening, however, Hitler heard from Prince Philip of\r\nHessen, his Ambassador at Rome, that he had just returned from the\r\nPalazzo Venezia, and Mussolini had accepted the whole affair in a\r\nvery-friendly manner. The telephone conversation went thus:\r\n\r\n“Hesen: I have just come back from Palazzo Venezia. The Duce accepted\r\nthe whole thing in a very-friendly manner. He sends you his regards. He\r\nhad been informed from Austria, Schuschnigg gave him the news. He had\r\nthen said it would be a complete impossibility. It would be a bluff,\r\nsuch a thing could not be done. So he was told that it was unfortunately\r\narranged thus and it could not be changed any more. Then Mussolini said\r\nthat Austria would be immaterial to him.\r\n\r\n“Fuehrer: Then, please, tell Mussolini, I will never forget him for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n“H: Yes.\r\n\r\n“F: Never, never, never, whatever happens. I am still ready to make a\r\nquite different agreement with him.\r\n\r\n“H: Yes, I told him that, too.\r\n\r\n“F: As soon as the Austrian affair has been settled, I shall be ready to\r\ngo with him through thick and thin, nothing matters.\r\n\r\n“H: Yes, my Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n“F: Listen, I shall make any agreement—I am no longer in fear of the\r\nterrible position which would have existed militarily in case we had\r\ngotten into a conflict. You may tell him that I do thank him ever so\r\nmuch, never, never shall I forget that.\r\n\r\n“H: Yes, my Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n“F: I will never forget it, whatever will happen. If he should ever need\r\nany help or be in any danger, he can be convinced that I shall stick to\r\nhim whatever might happen, even if the whole world were against him.\r\n\r\n“H: Yes, my Fuehrer.” (_2949-PS, Part N_)\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that Jodl referred in his diary (_1780-PS_) to the\r\nletter which Hitler sent to Mussolini. In this letter, dated 11 March\r\n1938, after stating that Austria had been declining into anarchy, Hitler\r\nwrote: “I have decided to reestablish order in my Fatherland, order and\r\ntranquility, and to give to the popular will the possibility of settling\r\nits own fate in unmistakable fashion openly and by its own decision.” He\r\nstated that this was only an act of self-defense, that he had no hostile\r\nintentions toward Italy. (_2510-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter the invasion, when in Linz, Austria, Hitler communicated his\r\ngratitude to Mussolini once more, this time by telegraph: “Mussolini, I\r\nwill never forget you for this.” (_2467-PS_)\r\n\r\n(6) _The Appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor._ Late in the\r\nevening of March 11, President Miklas appointed Seyss-Inquart as\r\nChancellor. The radio announcement of Seyss-Inquart’s appointment was\r\nmade at 11:15 p. m. (_2465-PS_)\r\n\r\n(7) _Later Communications with London—Misleading Explanations._ On\r\nSunday, 13 March 1938, the day after the invasion, Goering, who had been\r\nleft in charge of the Reich by Hitler, telephoned Ribbentrop in London.\r\nTheir conversation disclosed the way in which the Nazis soothed and\r\nmisled other nations:\r\n\r\n    “G: As you know the Fuehrer has entrusted me with the\r\n    administration of the current government procedures (_Fuehrung\r\n    der Regierungsgeschaft_). And therefore I wanted to inform you.\r\n    There is overwhelming joy in Austria, that you can hear over the\r\n    radio.\r\n\r\n    “R: Yes, it is fantastic, isn’t it?\r\n\r\n    “G: Yes, the last march into the Rhineland is completely\r\n    overshadowed. The Fuehrer was deeply moved, when he talked to me\r\n    last night. You must remember it was the first time that he saw\r\n    his homeland again. Now, I mainly want to talk about political\r\n    things. Well, this story we had given an ultimatum, that is just\r\n    foolish gossip. From the very beginning the National Socialist\r\n    ministers and the representatives of the people\r\n    (_Volksreferenten_) have presented the ultimatum. Later on, more\r\n    and more prominent people of the Movement Party participated,\r\n    and as a natural result, the Austrian National Socialist\r\n    ministers asked us to back them up, so they would not be\r\n    completely beaten up against and be subjected to terror and\r\n    civil war. Then we told them we would not allow Schuschnigg to\r\n    provoke a civil war, under no circumstances. Whether by\r\n    Schuschnigg’s direct order, or with consent the Communists and\r\n    the Reds had been armed, and were already making demonstrations,\r\n    which were photographed with “Heil Moskau” and so on; naturally;\r\n    all these facts caused some danger for Wiener-Neustadt. Then you\r\n    have to consider that Schuschnigg made his speeches, telling\r\n    them the Fatherland Front (_Vaterlandische Front_) would fight\r\n    to its last man; one could not know that they would capitulate\r\n    like that and therefore Seyss-Inquart who already had taken over\r\n    the government asked us to march in immediately. Before we had\r\n    already marched up to the frontier since we could not know\r\n    whether there would be a civil war or not. These are the actual\r\n    facts which can be proved by documents. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “G: No, no, I think so, too. Only, I did not know if you spoke\r\n    already to these people. I want that you once more,—but no—not\r\n    at all once more,—but generally speaking—tell the following to\r\n    Halifax and Chamberlain: It is not correct that Germany has\r\n    given any ultimatum. This is a lie by Schuschnigg, because the\r\n    ultimatum was presented to him by S-I, Glaise-Horstenau and\r\n    Jury. Furthermore, it is not true that we have presented an\r\n    ultimatum to the Federal President, but it also was given by the\r\n    others and as far as I know just a military-attache came along,\r\n    asked by S-I, because of a technical question; he was supposed\r\n    to ask whether in case S-I would ask for the support of German\r\n    troops, Germany would grant this request. Furthermore, I want to\r\n    state that S-I asked us expressly by phone as by telegram to\r\n    send troops because he did not know about the situation in\r\n    Wiener-Neustadt, Vienna, and so on; because arms had been\r\n    distributed there. And then he could not know how the Fatherland\r\n    Front might react since they always had had such a big mouth.\r\n\r\n    “R: Mr. Goering, tell me, how is the situation in Vienna, is\r\n    everything settled yet?\r\n\r\n    “G: Yes. Yesterday I landed hundreds of airplanes with some\r\n    companies, in order to secure the airfield and they were\r\n    received with joy. Today the advance unit of the 17 division\r\n    marches in, together with the Austrian troops. Also I want to\r\n    point out that the Austrian troops did not withdraw but that\r\n    they got together and fraternized immediately with the German\r\n    troops, wherever they were stationed.” (_2949-PS, Part W_)\r\n\r\nIn view of the previous conversations, these are interesting\r\nexplanations—that the ultimatum was made by Seyss-Inquart alone and not\r\nby Goering; that Lt. Gen. Muff, the military attache, came along merely\r\nto answer a technical question; and that Seyss-Inquart asked expressly\r\nby telephone and by telegram for troops. But perhaps this conversation\r\ncan best be understood in light of the actual physical scene of time and\r\nplace:\r\n\r\n    “G: Well, do come! I shall be delighted to see you.\r\n\r\n    “R: I shall see you this afternoon.\r\n\r\n    “G: The weather is wonderful here. Blue sky. I am sitting here\r\n    on my balcony—all covered with blankets—in the fresh air,\r\n    drinking my coffee. Later on I have to drive in, I have to make\r\n    the speech, and the birds are twittering, and here and there I\r\n    can hear over the radio the enthusiasm, which must be wonderful\r\n    over there.\r\n\r\n    “R: That is marvelous.” (_2949-PS, Part W_)\r\n\r\nThe British Foreign Office had protested the tactics employed by the\r\nGerman Government. In a letter dated 12 March 1938 Ambassador Neville\r\nHenderson, at the British Embassy, Berlin, wrote to Lord Halifax,\r\nForeign Minister, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “My Lord,\r\n\r\n    “With reference to your telegram No. 79 of March 11th, I have\r\n    the honor to transmit to Your Lordship herewith a copy of a\r\n    letter which I addressed to Baron von Neurath in accordance with\r\n    the instructions contained therein and which was delivered on\r\n    the same evening.\r\n\r\n    “The French Ambassador addressed a similar letter to Baron von\r\n    Neurath at the same time.” (_3045-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe enclosure was the note of March 11th from the British Embassy to Von\r\nNeurath and it reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Reich Minister,\r\n\r\n    “My Government are informed that a German ultimatum was\r\n    delivered this afternoon at Vienna demanding _inter alia_, the\r\n    resignation of the Chancellor and his replacement by the\r\n    Minister of the Interior, a new Cabinet of which two-thirds of\r\n    the members were to be National Socialists, and the re-admission\r\n    of the Austrian Legion to the country with the duty of keeping\r\n    order in Vienna.\r\n\r\n    “I am instructed by my Government to represent immediately to\r\n    the German Government that if this report is correct, H.M.G. in\r\n    the U.K. feel bound to register a protest in the strongest terms\r\n    against such use of coercion backed by force against an\r\n    independent State in order to create a situation incompatible\r\n    with its national independence.\r\n\r\n    “As the German Minister for Foreign Affairs has already been\r\n    informed in London, such action is found to produce the greatest\r\n    reactions of which it is impossible to foretell the issues.”\r\n    (_3045-PS_)\r\n\r\nVon Neurath wrote a letter of response dated 12 March 1938. He first\r\nobjected to the fact that the British Government was undertaking the\r\nrole of protector of Austria’s independence:\r\n\r\n    “In the name of the German Government I must point out here that\r\n    the Royal British Government has no right to assume the role of\r\n    a protector of Austria’s independence. In the course of\r\n    diplomatic consultations on the Austrian question, the German\r\n    Government never left any doubt with the Royal British\r\n    Government that the formation of relations between Germany and\r\n    Austria could not be considered anything but the inner concern\r\n    of the German people and that it did not affect third Powers.”\r\n    (_3287-PS_)\r\n\r\nThen, in response to the assertions regarding Germany’s ultimatum, Von\r\nNeurath set out what he stated to be the true version of events:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Instead, the former Austrian Chancellor announced, on the\r\n    evening of the 9th of March, the surprising and arbitrary\r\n    resolution, decided on by himself, to hold an election within a\r\n    few days which, under the prevailing circumstances, and\r\n    especially according to the details provided for the execution\r\n    of the election, could and was to have the sole purpose of\r\n    oppressing politically the predominant majority of the\r\n    population of Austria. As could have been foreseen, this\r\n    procedure, being a flagrant violation of the agreement of\r\n    Berchtesgaden, led to a very critical point in Austria’s\r\n    internal situation. It was only natural that the members of the\r\n    then Austrian Cabinet who had not taken part in the decision for\r\n    an election protested very strongly against it. Therefore, a\r\n    crisis of the Cabinet occurred in Vienna which, on the 11th of\r\n    March, resulted in the resignation of the former Chancellor and\r\n    in the formation of a new Cabinet. It is untrue that the Reich\r\n    used forceful pressure to bring about this development.\r\n    Especially the assertion which was spread later by the former\r\n    Chancellor, that the German Government had presented the Federal\r\n    President with a conditional ultimatum, is a pure invention;\r\n    according to the ultimatum he had to appoint a proposed\r\n    candidate as Chancellor and to form a Cabinet conforming to the\r\n    proposals of the German Government, otherwise the invasion of\r\n    Austria by German troops was held in prospect. The truth of the\r\n    matter is that the question of sending military or police forces\r\n    from the Reich was only brought up when the newly formed\r\n    Austrian Cabinet addressed a telegram, already published by the\r\n    press, to the German Government, urgently asked for the dispatch\r\n    of German troops as soon as possible in order to restore peace\r\n    and in order to avoid bloodshed. Faced with the immediately\r\n    threatening danger of a bloody civil war in Austria, the German\r\n    Government then decided to comply with the appeal addressed to\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    “This being the state of affairs, it is impossible that the\r\n    attitude of the German Government, as asserted in your letter,\r\n    could lead to some unforeseeable reactions. A complete picture\r\n    of the political situation is given in the proclamation which,\r\n    at noon today, the German Reich Chancellor has addressed to the\r\n    German people. Dangerous reactions to this situation can take\r\n    place only if eventually a third party should try to exercise\r\n    its influence, contrary to the peaceful intentions and\r\n    legitimate aims of the German Government on the shaping of\r\n    events in Austria, which would be incompatible with the right of\r\n    self-government of the German people.” (_3287-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn light of the documents already adverted to, this version of events\r\ngiven by von Neurath is palpably untrue.\r\n\r\nF. _The Invasion and Absorption of Austria._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Invasion and Immediate Events: Control of Austria in Fact._ In\r\naccordance with the directive of March 11 (_C-182_), the German Army\r\ncrossed the Austrian border at daybreak on 12 March 1938. Hitler issued\r\na proclamation to the German people announcing and purporting to justify\r\nthe invasion (_TC-47_). The British Government and the French Government\r\nfiled protests.\r\n\r\nThe German Government and the Austrian National Socialists swiftly\r\nsecured their grip on Austria. Seyss-Inquart welcomed Hitler at Linz and\r\nthey both expressed their joy over events of the day. Seyss-Inquart in\r\nhis speech declared Article 88 of the Treaty of St. Germain inoperative.\r\n(_2485-PS_)\r\n\r\nA telegram from the American Legation in Vienna to the Secretary of\r\nState, on 12 March 1938, gave a picture of what was happening in Vienna:\r\n\r\n    “Secretary of State,\r\n\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\n    70, March 12, noon.\r\n\r\n    “Numerous German bombers flying over Vienna dropping leaflets\r\n    ‘National Socialist Germany greets its possession National\r\n    Socialist Austria and its new government in true indivisible\r\n    union’.\r\n\r\n    “Continual rumors small German troop movements into Austria and\r\n    impending arrival Austrian legion.\r\n\r\n    “SS and SA in undisputed control in Vienna.\r\n\r\n    “Police wear swastika arm bands.

First,\r\nMiklas was caused to resign as President (_2466-PS_). Seyss-Inquart\r\nbecame both Chancellor and President. He then signed a Federal\r\nConstitutional Law of 13 March 1938, for the Reunion of Austria with the\r\nGerman Reich, which in turn was incorporated into the Reich Statute of\r\nReunion passed the same day (_2307-PS_). This Federal Constitutional Law\r\ndeclared Austria to be a province of the German Reich.\r\n\r\nBy annexing Austria into the German Reich, Germany violated Article 80\r\nof the Treaty of Versailles, which provides:\r\n\r\n    “Germany acknowledges and will respect the independence of\r\n    Austria within the frontier which may be fixed in a treaty\r\n    between that State and the principle Allied and Associated\r\n    Powers; she agrees that this independence shall be inalienable,\r\n    * * *”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Austrian invasion violated Article 88 of the Treaty of\r\nSt. Germain, which provides:\r\n\r\n    “The independence of Austria is inalienable otherwise than with\r\n    the consent of the Council of the League of Nations.\r\n    Consequently Austria undertakes in the absence of the consent of\r\n    the said Council to abstain from any act which might directly or\r\n    indirectly or by any means whatever compromise her independence,\r\n    particularly, and until her admission to membership of the\r\n    League of Nations, by participation in the affairs of another\r\n    Power.”\r\n\r\nThis basic constitutional law provided for a plebiscite to be held on 10\r\nApril 1938, concerning the question of reunion. But this was a mere\r\nformality. The plebiscite could only confirm the union. It could not\r\nundo Germany’s union with and control over Austria. To illustrate the\r\nway in which legal consolidation was swiftly assured, with Austria\r\noccupied by troops, it is not necessary to do more than review some of\r\nthe statutes passed within the month. Hitler placed the Austrian Federal\r\nArmy under his command and required all members of the Army to take an\r\noath of allegiance to Hitler as their Supreme Commander (_2936-PS_).\r\nPublic officials of the Province of Austria were required to take an\r\noath of office swearing obedience to Hitler, Fuehrer of the German Reich\r\nand People; Jewish officials, as defined, were not permitted to take the\r\noath. (_2311-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler and Frick signed a decree applying to Austria various Reich laws,\r\nincluding the law of 1933 against formation of new parties and the 1933\r\nlaw for the preservation of unity of party and state (2310-PS). Hitler,\r\nFrick, and Goering ordered that the Reich Minister of the Interior be\r\nthe central authority for carrying out the reunion of Austria with the\r\nGerman Reich. (_1060-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn connection with Germany’s extensive propaganda campaign to ensure\r\nacceptability of the German regime, Goebbels established a Reich\r\nPropaganda Office in Vienna (_2935-PS_). The ballot, addressed to\r\nsoldiers of the former Austrian Army as “German soldier”, asked the\r\nvoters whether they agreed with the “accomplishment” and “ratification”\r\non March 13, 1938, of the reuniting of Austria with Germany (_1659-PS_).\r\nThe groundwork was fully laid before the holding of the plebiscite “for\r\nGerman men and women of Austria” promised in the basic law of March 13.\r\n(_2307-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Importance of Austria in Further Aggressions._ Germany’s desire\r\nto consummate the Anschluss with Austria, and its determination to\r\nexecute that aim in the way and at the time that it did (with threat of\r\nmilitary force, quickly, and despite political risks), was due to the\r\nimportance of Austria in its further plans of aggression. The conference\r\nof the conspirators held on November 5, 1937, which laid plans for\r\naggressive war in Europe, outlined as objectives in Austria the conquest\r\nof food, through expulsion of a million people, and an increase in\r\nfighting strength in part through the improvement in frontier.\r\n(_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nAustria yielded material resources. Moreover she provided ready cash,\r\ntaken from the Jews and from the Austrian Government. One of the first\r\norders passed after the Anschluss was an order signed by Hitler, Frick,\r\nSchwerin von Krosigk, and Schacht, for the transfer to the Reich of the\r\nassets of the Austrian National Bank. (_2313-PS_)\r\n\r\nAustria yielded human resources. Three months after Anschluss, there was\r\nenacted a decree requiring 21-year-old men to report for active military\r\nservice. (_1660-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd the acquisition of Austria improved the military strategic position\r\nof the German Army. In a lecture delivered by General Jodl, Chief of the\r\nGeneral Staff of the Armed Forces, on 7 November 1943, at Munich, to the\r\nGauleiters, Jodl reviewed the situation in 1938:\r\n\r\n    “The Austrian ‘Anschluss’ in its turn, brought with it not only\r\n    the fulfilment of an old national aim but also had the effect\r\n    both of reinforcing our fighting strength and of materially\r\n    improving our strategic position. Whereas up till then the\r\n    territory of Czechoslovakia had projected in a most menacing way\r\n    right into Germany (a wasp waist in the direction of France and\r\n    an air base for the Allies, in particular Russia),\r\n    Czechoslovakia herself was now enclosed by pincers. Its own\r\n    strategic position had now become so unfavorable that she was\r\n    bound to fall a victim to any attack pressed home with rigor\r\n    before effective aid from the WEST could be expected to arrive.”\r\n    (_L-172_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators were now ready to carry out the second part of\r\ntheir second phase of their aggressions. Czechoslovakia was next.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO AGGRESSION AGAINST\r\n                                AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n    Document     │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                 │                                        │      │\r\n                 │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                 │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                 │                                        │      │\r\n                 │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                 │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F) 3│      │  23-24,\r\n                 │  (a, b); V.                            │  I   │      29\r\n                 │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                 │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                 │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                 │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                 │trial.

THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAN TO INVADE CZECHOSLOVAKIA\r\n\r\nA. _Development of the Nazi Program of Aggression._\r\n\r\nIn the period 1933-1936 the conspirators had initiated a program of\r\nrearmament designed to give the Third Reich military strength and\r\npolitical bargaining power to be used against other nations.\r\nFurthermore, beginning in the year 1936 they had embarked on a\r\npreliminary program of expansion which, as it turned out, was to last\r\nuntil March 1939. This program was intended to shorten Germany’s\r\nfrontiers, to increase its industrial and food-reserves, and to place it\r\nin a position, both industrially and strategically, from which the Nazis\r\ncould launch a more ambitious and more devastating campaign of\r\naggression. At the moment, in the early spring of 1938, when the Nazi\r\nconspirators first began to lay concrete plans for the conquest of\r\nCzechoslovakia they had reached approximately the halfway point in this\r\npreliminary program.\r\n\r\nThe preceding autumn, at the conference in the Reichs Chancellery on 5\r\nNovember 1937, Hitler had set forth the program which Germany was to\r\nfollow. The events of this conference are contained in the so-called\r\nHossbach minutes. The question for Germany, as the Fuehrer had informed\r\nhis military commanders at this meeting, is where the greatest possible\r\nconquest can be made at the lowest cost (_386-PS_). At the top of his\r\nagenda stood two countries: Austria and Czechoslovakia. On 12 March 1938\r\nAustria was occupied by the German Army, and on the following day it was\r\nannexed to the Reich. The time had come for a redefinition of German\r\nintentions toward Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nA little more than a month later Hitler and Keitel met to discuss plans\r\nfor the envelopment and conquest of the Czechoslovak State. On 21 April\r\n1938, Hitler and Keitel discussed the pretexts which Germany might\r\ndevelop to serve as an excuse for a sudden and overwhelming attack. They\r\nconsidered the provocation of a period of diplomatic squabbling which,\r\ngrowing more serious, would lead to the excuse for war. In the\r\nalternative, and this alternative they found to be preferable, they\r\nplanned to unleash a lightning attack as the result of an “incident” of\r\ntheir own creation. Consideration was given to the assassination of the\r\nGerman Ambassador at Prague to create the requisite incident. The\r\nnecessity of propaganda to guide the conduct of Germans in\r\nCzechoslovakia and to intimidate the Czechs was recognized. Problems of\r\ntransport and tactics were discussed with a view to overcoming all\r\nCzechoslovak resistance within four days, thus presenting the world with\r\na fait accompli and forestalling outside intervention. (_388-PS, Item\r\n2_)\r\n\r\nThus in mid-April 1938 the designs of the Nazi conspirators to conquer\r\nCzechoslovakia had already reached the stage of practical planning.\r\n\r\nB. _The Background of Friendly Diplomatic Relations._\r\n\r\nThis conspiracy must be viewed against a background of amicable\r\nGerman-Czech diplomatic relations. Although they had in the fall of 1937\r\ndetermined to destroy the Czechoslovak State, the leaders of the German\r\ngovernment were bound by a treaty of arbitration and by assurances\r\nfreely given to observe the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia. By a formal\r\ntreaty signed at Locarno on 16 October 1925, Germany and Czechoslovakia\r\nagreed, with certain exceptions, to refer to an arbitral tribunal or to\r\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice,\r\n\r\n    “* * * all disputes of every kind between Germany and\r\n    Czechoslovakia with regard to which the parties are in conflict\r\n    as to their respective rights, and which it may not be possible\r\n    to settle amicably by the normal methods of diplomacy. * * *”\r\n    (_TC-14_)\r\n\r\nThe preamble of this treaty stated:\r\n\r\n    “The President of the German Empire and the President of the\r\n    Czechoslovak Republic; equally resolved to maintain peace\r\n    between Germany and Czechoslovakia by assuring the peaceful\r\n    settlement of differences which might arise between the two\r\n    countries; declaring that respect for the rights established by\r\n    treaty or resulting from the law of nations is obligatory for\r\n    international tribunals; agreeing to recognize that the rights\r\n    of a State cannot be modified save with its consent; and\r\n    considering that sincere observance of the methods of peaceful\r\n    settlement of international disputes permits of resolving,\r\n    without recourse to force, questions which may become the cause\r\n    of division between States; have decided to embody in a treaty\r\n    their common intentions in this respect. * * *” (_TC-14_)\r\n\r\nFormal and categoric assurances of their good will toward Czechoslovakia\r\nwere forthcoming from the Nazi conspirators as late as March 1938. On 11\r\nand 12 March 1938, at the time of the annexation of Austria, Germany had\r\na considerable interest in inducing Czechoslovakia not to mobilize. At\r\nthis time Goering assured M. Mastny, the Czechoslovak Minister in\r\nBerlin, on behalf of the German Government that German-Czech relations\r\nwere not adversely affected by the developments in Austria and that\r\nGermany had no hostile intentions toward Czechoslovakia. As a token of\r\nhis sincerity Goering accompanied his assurance with the statement:\r\n“_Ich gebe Ihnen mein Ehrenwort_” (“I give you my word of honor”)\r\n(_TC-27_). At the same time von Neurath, who was handling German foreign\r\naffairs during Ribbentrop’s stay in London, assured M. Mastny on behalf\r\nof Hitler and the German government that Germany still considered\r\nherself bound by the Arbitration Convention of 1925 (_TC-27_).\r\n\r\nC. _Planning for Aggression._\r\n\r\nBehind the screen of these assurances the Nazi conspirators proceeded\r\nwith their military and political plans for aggression. Ever since the\r\npreceding fall it had been established that the immediate aim of German\r\npolicy was the elimination of Austria and Czechoslovakia. In both\r\ncountries the Nazi conspirators planned to undermine the will to resist\r\nby propaganda and by fifth column activities, while the actual military\r\npreparations were being developed. The Austrian operation, which\r\nreceived priority for political and strategic reasons, was carried out\r\nin February and March 1938. Thenceforth _Wehrmacht_ planning was devoted\r\nto Case Green (_Fall Gruen_), the designation given to the operation\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nThe military plans for Case Green had been drafted in outline form as\r\nearly as June 1937. The OKW top secret “Directive for the Unified\r\nPreparation of the Armed Forces for War”, signed by von Blomberg on 24\r\nJune 1937 and promulgated to the Army, Navy, and Luftwaffe for the year\r\nbeginning 1 July 1937, included as a probable warlike eventuality, for\r\nwhich a concentration plan was to be drafted, Case Green (“War on two\r\nfronts with the main struggle in the southeast”) (_C-175_). The original\r\nsection of this directive dealing with the “probable war” against\r\nCzechoslovakia—it was later revised—opens with this supposition:\r\n\r\n    “The war in the east can begin with a surprise German operation\r\n    against Czechoslovakia in order to parry the imminent attack of\r\n    a superior enemy coalition. The necessary conditions to justify\r\n    such an action politically and in the eyes of international law\r\n    must be created beforehand.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nAfter detailing possible enemies and neutrals in the event of such\r\naction, the directive continues as follows:\r\n\r\n    “2. The task of the German Armed Forces is to make their\r\n    preparations in such a way that the bulk of all forces can break\r\n    into Czechoslovakia quickly, by surprise, and with the greatest\r\n    force, while in the West the minimum strength is provided as\r\n    rear cover for this attack.\r\n\r\n    “The aim and object of this surprise attack by the German Armed\r\n    Forces should be to eliminate from the very beginning, and for\r\n    the duration of the war, the threat by Czechoslovakia to the\r\n    rear of the operations in the West, and to take from the Russian\r\n    Air Force the most substantial portion of its operational base\r\n    in Czechoslovakia. This must be done by the defeat of the enemy\r\n    armed forces and the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia.”\r\n    (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nThe introduction to this directive sets forth as one of its guiding\r\nprinciples the following statement:\r\n\r\n    “The politically fluid world situation, which does not preclude\r\n    surprising incidents, demands constant preparedness for war on\r\n    the part of the German Armed Forces * * * to make possible the\r\n    military exploitation of politically favorable opportunities\r\n    should they occur.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nIt ordered further work on the plan for mobilization without public\r\nannouncement “in order to put the Armed Forces in a position to be able\r\nto begin a war suddenly which will take the enemy by surprise both as\r\nregards strength and time of attack.” (_C-175_). This directive is, of\r\ncourse, a directive for staff planning. But the nature of the planning,\r\nand the very tangible and ominous developments which resulted from it,\r\ngive it a significance that it would not have in another setting.\r\n\r\nPlanning along the lines of this directive was carried forward during\r\nthe fall of 1937 and the winter of 1937-1938. On the political level\r\nthis planning for the conquest of Czechoslovakia received the approval\r\nand support of Hitler in the conference with his military\r\ncommanders-in-chief on 5 November 1937 (_386-PS_). In early March 1938,\r\nbefore the march into Austria, Ribbentrop and Keitel were concerned over\r\nthe extent of the information about war aims against Czechoslovakia to\r\nbe furnished to Hungary. On 4 March 1938 Ribbentrop wrote to Keitel,\r\nenclosing for Keitel’s confidential cognizance the minutes of a\r\nconference with Sztojay, the Hungarian ambassador to Germany, who had\r\nsuggested an interchange of views (_2786-PS_). An acknowledgment of the\r\nreceipt of this letter was signed by Keitel on 5 March. In his letter to\r\nKeitel, Ribbentrop said:\r\n\r\n    “I have many doubts about such negotiations. In case we should\r\n    discuss with Hungary possible war aims against Czechoslovakia,\r\n    the danger exists that other parties as well would be informed\r\n    about this. I would greatly appreciate it if you would notify me\r\n    briefly whether any commitments were made here in any respect.”\r\n    (_2786-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _Development of Specific Plans._\r\n\r\nAt the 21 April meeting between Hitler and Keitel, specific plans for\r\nthe attack on Czechoslovakia were discussed for the first time (_388-PS,\r\nItem 2_). This meeting was followed in the late spring and summer of\r\n1938 by a series of memoranda and telegrams advancing Case Green. These\r\nnotes and communications were carefully filed at Hitler’s headquarters\r\nby Major Schmundt, the Fuehrer’s military adjutant, and were captured by\r\nAmerican troops in a cellar at Obersalzberg, Hitler’s headquarters, near\r\nBerchtesgaden. This file, preserved intact, is document (_388-PS_).\r\n\r\nThe individual items in this file tell more graphically than any\r\nnarrative the progress of the Nazi conspirators’ planning to launch an\r\nunprovoked war against Czechoslovakia. From the start the Nazi leaders\r\ndisplayed a lively interest in intelligence data concerning Czechoslovak\r\narmament and defense. This interest is reflected in _Item 4_ of the\r\nSchmundt file, a telegram from Colonel Zeitzler in General Jodl’s office\r\nof the OKW to Schmundt at Hitler’s headquarters; _Item 12_, Short survey\r\nof Armament of the Czech Army, dated Berlin 9 June 1938 and initialed\r\n“Z” for Zeitzler; and _Item 13_, Questions of the Fuehrer, dated Berlin,\r\n9 June 1938 and classified “Most Secret”. The following are four of the\r\nquestions on which Hitler wanted authoritative information:\r\n\r\n    “Question 1:  Armament of the Czech Army?\r\n\r\n    “Question 2:  How many battalions, etc., are employed in the\r\n    West for the construction of emplacements?\r\n\r\n    “Question 3:  Are the fortifications of Czechoslovakia still\r\n    occupied in unreduced strength?\r\n\r\n    “Question 4:  Frontier protection in the West?” (_388-PS, Item\r\n    13_)\r\n\r\nThese questions were answered in detail by the OKW and initialed by\r\nColonel Zeitzler of Jodl’s staff.\r\n\r\nAs a precaution against French and British action during the attack on\r\nCzechoslovakia, it was necessary for the Nazi conspirators to rush the\r\npreparation of fortification measures along the western frontier of\r\nGermany. A telegram, presumably sent from Schmundt in Berchtesgaden to\r\nBerlin, read in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Inform Colonel General von Brauchitsch and General Keitel: * *\r\n    * The Fuehrer repeatedly emphasized the necessity of pressing\r\n    forward greatly the fortification work in the west.” (_388-PS,\r\n    Item 8_)\r\n\r\nIn May, June, July, and August of 1938 conferences between Hitler and\r\nhis political and military advisers resulted in the issuance of a series\r\nof constantly revised directives for the attack. It was decided that\r\npreparations for X-day, the day of the attack, should be completed no\r\nlater than 1 October.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of 28 May 1938 Hitler called a conference of his\r\nprincipal military and political advisers in the winter garden of the\r\nReichs Chancellery in Berlin. This conference was the occasion on which\r\nHitler made known to the inner circle of the Nazi conspirators the\r\noutlines of his plan to attack Czechoslovakia and issued the necessary\r\ninstructions. The meeting is described in an affidavit of Fritz\r\nWiedemann, who at that time was Hitler’s adjutant:\r\n\r\n    “FRITZ WIEDEMANN, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    “From the month of January 1935 to January 1939 I served as\r\n    adjutant to Hitler. In this time my duties were to handle\r\n    correspondence and complaints addressed to the Fuehrer’s office.\r\n    Occasionally I attended conferences held by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “I recall that on the afternoon of 28 May 1938 Hitler called a\r\n    conference in the winter garden of the Reichs Chancellery of all\r\n    the people who were important, from the Foreign Office, the\r\n    Army, and the Command Staffs. Those present at this conference,\r\n    as I recall, included Goering, Ribbentrop, von Neurath, General\r\n    Beck, Admiral Raeder, General Keitel, and General von\r\n    Brauchitsch. On this occasion Hitler made the following\r\n    statement: ‘It is my unshakable will that Czechoslovakia shall\r\n    be wiped off the map.’ Hitler then revealed the outlines of the\r\n    plan to attack Czechoslovakia. Hitler addressed himself to the\r\n    Generals, saying: ‘So, we will first tackle the situation in the\r\n    East. Then I will give you three to four years’ time, and then\r\n    we will settle the situation in the West.’ The situation in the\r\n    West was meant to be the war against England and France.\r\n\r\n    “I was considerably shaken by these statements, and on leaving\r\n    the Reichs Chancellery I said to Herr von Neurath: ‘Well, what\r\n    do you say to these revelations?’ Neurath thought that the\r\n    situation was not so serious as it appeared and that nothing\r\n    would happen before the spring of 1939.\r\n\r\n                                             “/s/  Fr. Wiedemann.”\r\n                                                     (_3037-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the months after the occupation of the Sudetenland Hitler made no\r\nsecret of this meeting. In a speech before the Reichstag on 30 January\r\n1939, Hitler spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n    “On account of this intolerable provocation which had been\r\n    aggravated by a truly infamous persecution and terrorization of\r\n    our Germans there, I had resolved to solve once and for all, and\r\n    this time radically, the Sudeten-German question. On May 28 I\r\n    ordered (1) that preparations should be made for military action\r\n    against this state by October 2. I ordered (2) the immense and\r\n    accelerated expansion of our defensive front in the West.”\r\n    (_2360-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler also referred to this conference in his meeting with President\r\nHacha on 15 March 1939. (_2798-PS_)\r\n\r\nTwo days after this conference, on 30 May 1938, Hitler issued the\r\nrevised military directive for Case Green. This directive is _Item 11_\r\nin the Schmundt file (_388-PS_). Entitled “Two front war with main\r\neffort in the Southeast,” this directive replaced the corresponding\r\nsection, Part 2, Section II, of the “Directive for Unified Preparation\r\nfor War” promulgated by von Blomberg on 24 June 1937 (_C-175_). This\r\ndirective represented a further development of the ideas for political\r\nand military action discussed by Hitler and Keitel in their conference\r\non 21 April. It is an expansion of a rough draft submitted by Keitel to\r\nHitler on 20 May, which may be found as _Item 5_ in the Schmundt file\r\n(_388-PS_). It was signed by Hitler. Only five copies were made. Three\r\ncopies were forwarded with a covering letter from Keitel to General von\r\nBrauchitsch for the Army, to Raeder for the Navy, and to Goering for the\r\nLuftwaffe. In his covering memorandum Keitel noted that its execution\r\nmust be assured “as from 1 October 1938 at the latest”. (_388-PS, Item\r\n11_)\r\n\r\nThis document, which is the basic directive under which the _Wehrmacht_\r\ncarried out its planning for Case Green, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. _Political Prerequisites._\r\n\r\n    “It is my unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia by\r\n    military action in the near future. It is the job of the\r\n    political leaders to await or bring about the politically and\r\n    militarily suitable moment.\r\n\r\n    “An inevitable development of conditions inside Czechoslovakia\r\n    or other political events in Europe creating a surprisingly\r\n    favorable opportunity and one which may never come again may\r\n    cause me to take early action.\r\n\r\n    “The proper choice and determined and full utilization of a\r\n    favorable moment is the surest guarantee of success. Accordingly\r\n    the preparations are to be made at once.\r\n\r\n    “2. _Political Possibilities for the Commencement of the\r\n    Action._\r\n\r\n    “The following are necessary prerequisites for the intended\r\n    invasion:\r\n\r\n        “_a._ suitable obvious cause and, with it\r\n\r\n        “_b._ sufficient political justification,\r\n\r\n        “_c._ action unexpected by the enemy, which will find\r\n        him prepared to the least possible degree.\r\n\r\n    “From a military as well as a political standpoint the most\r\n    favorable course is a lightning-swift action as the result of an\r\n    incident through which Germany is provoked in an unbearable way\r\n    for which at least part of world opinion will grant the moral\r\n    justification of military action.\r\n\r\n    “But even a period of tension, more or less preceding a war,\r\n    must terminate in sudden action on our part—which must have the\r\n    elements of surprise as regards time and extent—before the\r\n    enemy is so advanced in military preparedness that he cannot be\r\n    surpassed.\r\n\r\n    “3. _Conclusions for the Preparation of “Fall Gruen”._\r\n\r\n    _a._ For the _Armed War_ it is essential that the surprise\r\n    element as the most important factor contributing to success be\r\n    made full use of by appropriate preparatory measures already in\r\n    peace-time and by an unexpectedly rapid course of the action.\r\n    Thus it is essential to create a situation within the first four\r\n    days which plainly demonstrates, to hostile nations eager to\r\n    intervene, the hopelessness of the Czechoslovakian military\r\n    situation and which at the same time will give nations with\r\n    territorial claims on Czechoslovakia an incentive to intervene\r\n    immediately against Czechoslovakia. In such a case, intervention\r\n    by Poland and Hungary against Czechoslovakia may be expected,\r\n    especially if France—due to the obvious pro-German attitude of\r\n    Italy—fears, or at least hesitates, to unleash a European war\r\n    by intervening against Germany. Attempts by Russia to give\r\n    military support to Czechoslovakia mainly by the Air Force are\r\n    to be expected. If concrete successes are not achieved by the\r\n    land operations within the first few days, a European crisis\r\n    will certainly result. This knowledge must give commanders of\r\n    all ranks the impetus to decided and bold action.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ The _Propaganda War_ must on the one hand intimidate\r\n    Czechoslovakia by threats and soften her power of resistance, on\r\n    the other hand issue directions to national groups for support\r\n    in the Armed War and influence the neutrals into our way of\r\n    thinking. I reserve further directions and determination of the\r\n    date.\r\n\r\n    “4. _Tasks of the Armed Forces._\r\n\r\n    “Armed Forces Preparations are to be made on the following\r\n    basis:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ The mass of all forces must be employed against\r\n    Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ For the West, a minimum of forces are to be provided as\r\n    rear cover which may be required, the other frontiers in the\r\n    East against Poland and Lithuania are merely to be protected,\r\n    the Southern frontiers to be watched.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ The sections of the army which can be rapidly employed\r\n    must force the frontier fortifications with speed and decision\r\n    and must break into Czechoslovakia with the greatest daring in\r\n    the certainty that the bulk of the mobile army will follow them\r\n    with the utmost speed. Preparations for this are to be made and\r\n    timed in such a way that the sections of the army which can be\r\n    rapidly employed cross the frontier at the appointed time _at\r\n    the same time_ as the penetration by the Air Force before the\r\n    enemy can become aware of our mobilization.\r\n\r\n    “For this, a timetable between Army and Air Force is to be\r\n    worked out in conjunction with OKW and submitted to me for\r\n    approval.\r\n\r\n    “5. _Missions for the branches of the Armed Forces._\r\n\r\n    “_a._ _Army_: The basic principle of the surprise attack against\r\n    Czechoslovakia must not be endangered by the inevitable time\r\n    required for transporting the bulk of the field forces by rail\r\n    nor the initiative of the Air Force be wasted. Therefore it is\r\n    first of all essential to the army that as many assault columns\r\n    as possible be employed at the same time as the surprise attack\r\n    by the Air Force. These assault columns—the composition of\r\n    each, according to their tasks at that time—must be formed with\r\n    troops which can be employed rapidly owing to their proximity to\r\n    the frontier or to motorization and to special measures of\r\n    readiness. It must be the purpose of these thrusts to break into\r\n    the Czechoslovakian fortification lines at numerous points and\r\n    in a strategically favorable direction, to achieve a\r\n    breakthrough or to break them down from the rear. For the\r\n    success of this operation, cooperation with the Sudeten-German\r\n    frontier population, with deserters from the Czechoslovakian\r\n    army, with parachutists or airborne troops and with units of the\r\n    sabotage service will be of importance. The bulk of the army has\r\n    the task of frustrating the Czechoslovakian plan of defense, of\r\n    preventing the Czechoslovakian army from escaping into Slovakia,\r\n    of forcing a battle, of beating the Czechoslovakian army and of\r\n    occupying Bohemia and Moravia speedily. To this end a thrust\r\n    into the heart of Czechoslovakia must be made with the strongest\r\n    possible motorized and armored units using to the full the first\r\n    successes of the assault columns and the effects of the Air\r\n    Force operations. The rear cover provided for the _West_ must be\r\n    limited in numbers and quality to the extent which suits the\r\n    present state of fortifications. Whether the units assigned this\r\n    will be transported to the Western frontier immediately or held\r\n    back for the time being will be decided in my special order.\r\n    Preparations must however, be made to enable security\r\n    detachments to be brought up to the Western frontier even during\r\n    the strategic concentration ‘Gruen’. Independent of this, a\r\n    first security garrison must be improvised from the engineers at\r\n    present employed in constructing fortifications and from\r\n    formations of the Labor Corps. The _remaining frontiers_ as well\r\n    as East Prussia, are to be only weakly protected. But, always\r\n    depending on the political situation, the transfers by sea, of a\r\n    part or even the bulk of the active forces of East Prussia, into\r\n    the Reich must be taken into account.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ _Air Force._ While leaving a minimum of defensive forces\r\n    in the West, the Air Force is to be employed in bulk in a\r\n    surprise attack against Czechoslovakia. The frontier is to be\r\n    flown over at the same time as it is crossed by the first\r\n    section of the Army * * *.” (_388-PS, Item 11_)\r\n\r\nAfter detailed instructions for action by the Luftwaffe and by the Navy\r\nthe directive continues as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In war economy it is essential that in the field of the\r\n    armament industry a maximum-deployment of forces is made\r\n    possible through increased supplies. In the course of\r\n    operations, it is of value to contribute to the reinforcement of\r\n    the total war-economic strength by rapidly reconnoitering and\r\n    restarting important factories. For this reason the sparing of\r\n    Czechoslovakian industrial and works installations—insofar as\r\n    military operations permit.—can be of decisive importance to\r\n    us.” (_388-PS, Item 11_)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Nazi conspirators, four months before the date of\r\ntheir planned attack, were already looking forward to the contribution\r\nwhich the Czech industrial plant would make to the Nazi war economy. The\r\nlast paragraph of this directive reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “All preparations for sabotage and insurrection will be made by\r\n    OKW. They will be made, in agreement with and according to the\r\n    requirement of the branches of the Armed Forces, so that their\r\n    effects accord with the operations of the Army and Air Force.\r\n\r\n                                           “(Signed)  ADOLF HITLER\r\n                                                     “Certified copy\r\n                                                 “(Signed)  Zeitzler\r\n                              “Oberstleutnant on the General Staff.”\r\n                                                 (_388-PS, Item 11_)\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, on 18 June 1938, a draft for a new directive was\r\nprepared and initialed by Keitel. It does not supersede the 30 May\r\ndirective. It reads, in part:\r\n\r\n    “The immediate aim is a solution of the Czech problem by my own,\r\n    free decision; this stands in the foreground of my political\r\n    intentions. I am determined to use to the full every favorable\r\n    political opportunity to realize this aim.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “However, I will decide to take action against Czechoslovakia\r\n    only if I am firmly convinced as in the case of the occupation\r\n    of the demilitarized zone and the entry into Austria that France\r\n    will not march and therefore England will not intervene.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The directives necessary for the prosecution of the war itself\r\n    will be issued by me from time to time.”\r\n\r\n                                            “K [Initialed by Keitel]\r\n                                          Z [Initialed by Zeitzler]”\r\n                                                 (_388-PS, Item 14_)\r\n\r\nThe second and third parts of this directive contain general directions\r\nfor the deployment of troops and for precautionary measures in view of\r\nthe possibility that, during the execution of Case Green, France or\r\nEngland might declare war on Germany. Six pages of complicated schedules\r\nwhich follow this draft in the original have not been translated into\r\nEnglish. These schedules, which constitute _Item 15_ in the Schmundt\r\nfile (_388-PS_), give a timetable of specific measures for the\r\npreparation of the Army, Navy, and Luftwaffe for the contemplated\r\naction.\r\n\r\nCorroboration for the documents in the Schmundt file is found in three\r\nentries in General Jodl’s diary written in the spring of 1938\r\n(_1780-PS_). Although the first entry is not dated, it appears to have\r\nbeen written several months after the annexation of Austria:\r\n\r\n    “After annexation of Austria, the Fuehrer mentions that there is\r\n    no hurry to solve the Czech question because Austria has to be\r\n    digested first. Nevertheless preparations for Case Green will\r\n    have to be carried out energetically; they will have to be newly\r\n    prepared on the basis of the changed strategic position because\r\n    of the annexation of Austria. State of preparations (see\r\n    memorandum L I a of 19 April) reported to the Fuehrer on 21\r\n    April.\r\n\r\n    “The intention of the Fuehrer not to touch the Czech problem as\r\n    yet is changed because of the Czech strategic troop\r\n    concentration of 21 May, which occurs without any German threat\r\n    and without the slightest cause for it.\r\n\r\n    “Because of Germany’s self restraint, its consequences lead to a\r\n    loss of prestige of the Fuehrer, which he is not willing to take\r\n    once more. Therefore, the new order is issued for ‘green’ on 30\r\n    May.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_23 May_:\r\n\r\n    “Major Schmundt reports ideas of the Fuehrer. Further\r\n    conferences, which gradually reveal the exact intentions of the\r\n    Fuehrer take place with the Chief of the Armed Forces High\r\n    Command (OKW) on 28 May, 3 and 9 June, see enclosures. (War\r\n    Diary L).”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_30 May_:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer signs directive Green, where he states his final\r\n    decision to destroy Czechoslovakia soon and thereby initiates\r\n    military preparation all along the line. The previous intentions\r\n    of the Army must be changed considerably in the direction of an\r\n    immediate breakthrough into Czechoslovakia right on D-Day\r\n    (X-Tag), combined with aerial penetration by the Air Force.\r\n    Further details are derived from directive for strategic\r\n    concentration of the army. The whole contrast becomes acute once\r\n    more between the Fuehrer’s intuition that we must do it this\r\n    year and the opinion of the Army that we cannot do it as yet, as\r\n    most certainly the Western Powers will interfere and we are not\r\n    as yet equal to them.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nE. _Luftwaffe Participation in Early Planning for Case Green._\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1938 the Luftwaffe was also engaged in\r\nplanning in connection with the forthcoming Case Green and the further\r\nexpansion of the Reich. A Top Secret Document, dated 2 June 1938, was\r\nissued by Air Group Command 3 and entitled “Plan Study 1938: Instruction\r\nfor Deployment and Combat: Case Red.” (_R-150_). This is another staff\r\nplan, this time for mobilization and employment of the Luftwaffe in the\r\nevent of war with France. It is given significance by the considerable\r\nprogress, at this date, in planning for the attack on Czechoslovakia.\r\nVarious possibilities under which war with France may occur are noted:\r\nall of them are predicated on the assumption of a German-Czech conflict:\r\n\r\n    “France will\r\n\r\n    “_a_ either interfere in the struggle between the Reich and\r\n    Czechoslovakia in the course of ‘Case Green’, or\r\n\r\n    “_b_ start hostilities simultaneously with Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\n    “_c_ It is possible but not likely that France will begin the\r\n    fight, while Czechoslovakia still remains aloof.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Regardless of whether France enters the war as a result of\r\n    ‘Case Green’ or whether she makes the opening move of the war\r\n    simultaneously with Czechoslovakia, in any case the mass of the\r\n    German offensive formations will, in conjunction with the Army,\r\n    first deliver the decisive blow against Czechoslovakia.”\r\n    (_R-150_)\r\n\r\nBy mid-summer direct and detailed planning for Case Green was being\r\ncarried out by the Luftwaffe. In early August, at the direction of the\r\nLuftwaffe General Staff, the German Air Attache in Prague reconnoitered\r\nthe Freudenthal area of Czechoslovakia, south of Upper Silesia, for\r\nsuitable landing grounds. This action is disclosed by a report of the\r\nLuftwaffe General Staff, Intelligence Division, dated 12 August 1938\r\n(_1536-PS_). This was a Top Secret document, for General Officers only,\r\nof which only two copies were made. Attached as an enclosure was the\r\nreport of Major Moericke, the German air attache in Prague, dated 4\r\nAugust 1938. The first four paragraphs of the enclosure read:\r\n\r\n    “I was ordered by the General Staff of the Air Force to\r\n    reconnoitre the land in the region Freudenthal/Freihermersdorf\r\n    for landing possibilities.\r\n\r\n    “For this purpose I obtained private lodgings in Freudenthal\r\n    with the manufacturer Macholdt, through one of my trusted men in\r\n    Prague.\r\n\r\n    “I had specifically ordered this man to give no details about me\r\n    to M, particularly about my official position.\r\n\r\n    “I used my official car (_Dienst Pkw_) for the journey to\r\n    Freudenthal, taking precautions against being observed.”\r\n    (_1536-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy 25 August the imminence of the attack on Czechoslovakia compelled the\r\nissuance by the Luftwaffe of a detailed intelligence memorandum entitled\r\n“Extended Case Green,” which consisted of an estimate of possible action\r\nby the Western Powers during the attack on Czechoslovakia (_375-PS_).\r\nThis Top Secret memorandum of the Intelligence Section of the Luftwaffe\r\nGeneral Staff is dated at Berlin, 25 August 1938. Based on the\r\nassumption that Great Britain and France will declare war on Germany\r\nduring Case Green, this study contains an estimate of the strategy and\r\nair strength of the Western Powers as of 1 October 1938, the target date\r\nfor Case Green. The first two sentences read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The basic assumption is that France will declare war during the\r\n    Case Green. It is presumed that France will only decide upon war\r\n    if active military assistance by Great Britain is definitely\r\n    assured.” (_375-PS_)\r\n\r\nF. _Negotiations with Italy and Hungary about Case Green._\r\n\r\nKnowledge of pending action against Czechoslovakia was not confined to a\r\nclose circle of high officials of the Reich. During the summer Germany’s\r\nallies, Italy and Hungary, were apprised by one means or another of the\r\nplans of the Nazi conspirators. A captured document from German Foreign\r\nOffice files contains a confidential memorandum of a conversation with\r\nthe Italian ambassador, Attolico, in Berlin on 18 July 1938 (_2800-PS_).\r\nAt the bottom is a handwritten note, headed “For the Reichsminister\r\n[Ribbentrop] only.” This note reads:\r\n\r\n    “Attolico added that we had made it unmistakably clear to the\r\n    Italians what our intentions are regarding Czechoslovakia. He\r\n    also knew the appointed time well enough so that he could take\r\n    perhaps a two months’ holiday now which he could not do later\r\n    on.\r\n\r\n    “Giving an idea of the attitude of other governments Attolico\r\n    mentioned that the Roumanian government had refused to grant\r\n    application for leave to its Berlin Minister.” (_2800-PS_)\r\n\r\nA month later Mussolini sent a message to Berlin, asking that he be told\r\nthe date on which Case Green would take place. The German response is\r\noutlined in a German Foreign Office note on a conversation with\r\nAmbassador Attolico, signed “R” (for Ribbentrop) and dated 23 August\r\n1938:\r\n\r\n    “On the voyage of the ‘Patria’ Ambassador Attolico explained to\r\n    me that he had instructions to request the notification of a\r\n    contemplated time for German action against Czechoslovakia from\r\n    the German government.\r\n\r\n    “In case the Czechs should again cause a provocation against\r\n    Germany, Germany would march. This would be tomorrow, in six\r\n    months or perhaps in a year. However, I could promise him, that\r\n    the German government, in case of an increasing gravity of the\r\n    situation or as soon as the Fuehrer made his decision, would\r\n    notify the Italian Chief of Government as rapidly as possible.\r\n    In any case, the Italian government will be the first one Who\r\n    will receive such a notification.\r\n\r\n                                                     “23 Aug 1938\r\n                                                    “R (initial).”\r\n                                                        (_2791-PS_)\r\n\r\nFour days later Attolico again asked to be notified of the date of the\r\npending attack. The conversation is recorded in another German Foreign\r\nOffice Memorandum:\r\n\r\n    “Ambassador Attolico paid me a visit today at 12 o’clock to\r\n    communicate the following:\r\n\r\n    “He had received another written instruction from Mussolini\r\n    asking that Germany communicate in time the probable date of\r\n    action against Czechoslovakia. Mussolini asked for such\r\n    notification, as Mr. Attolico assured me, in order ‘to be able\r\n    to take in due time the necessary measures on the French\r\n    frontier.’\r\n\r\n                                            “Berlin, 27 August 1938\r\n                                                               “R\r\n\r\n    “N. B. I replied to Ambassador Attolico, just as on his former\r\n    demarche, that I could not impart any date to him, that,\r\n    however, in any case Mussolini would be the first one to be\r\n    informed of any decision.\r\n\r\n                                        “Berlin, 2 September 1938.”\r\n                                                        (_2792-PS_)\r\n\r\nHungary, which borders Czechoslovakia to the southeast, was from the\r\nfirst considered to be a possible participant in Case Green. It will be\r\nrecalled that in early March 1938 Keitel and Ribbentrop had exchanged\r\nletters on the question of bringing Hungary into the Nazi planning\r\n(_2786-PS_). At that time the decision was in the negative. But by\r\nmid-August 1938 the Nazi conspirators were attempting to persuade\r\nHungary to join in the attack.\r\n\r\nFrom August 21st to 26th Admiral Horthy and some of his ministers\r\nvisited Germany. Admiral Horthy witnessed the launching of the _Prince\r\nEugen_ and conferred with Hitler. There were discussions of the\r\nCzechoslovak question. A captured German Foreign Office document, signed\r\nby von Weizsäcker, records the conversations between Hitler and\r\nRibbentrop and a Hungarian delegation consisting of Horthy, Imredy, and\r\nKanya aboard the S. S. _Patria_ on 23 August 1938 (_2796-PS_). In this\r\nconference Ribbentrop inquired about the Hungarian attitude in the event\r\nof a German attack on Czechoslovakia and suggested that such an attack\r\nwould prove to be a good opportunity for Hungary. The Hungarians, with\r\nthe exception of Horthy, who wished to put the Hungarian intention to\r\nparticipate on record, proved reluctant to commit themselves. Thereupon\r\nHitler emphasized Ribbentrop’s statement, and said:\r\n\r\n    “Whoever wanted to join the meal would have to participate in\r\n    the cooking as well.” (_2796-PS_)\r\n\r\nVon Weizsäcker’s memorandum reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Von Ribbentrop inquired what Hungary’s attitude would be if the\r\n    Fuehrer would carry out his decision to answer a new Czech\r\n    provocation by force. The reply of the Hungarians presented two\r\n    kinds of obstacles: The Yugoslavian neutrality must be assured\r\n    if Hungary marches towards the North and perhaps the East.\r\n    Moreover, the Hungarian rearmament had only been started and 1\r\n    or 2 more years’ time for its development should be allowed.\r\n\r\n    “Von Ribbentrop then explained to the Hungarians that the\r\n    Yugoslavs would not dare to march while they were between the\r\n    pincers of the Axis Powers. Rumania alone would therefore not\r\n    move. England and France would also remain tranquil. England\r\n    would not recklessly risk her Empire. She knew our newly\r\n    acquired power. In reference to time, however, for the\r\n    above-mentioned situation, nothing definite could be predicted\r\n    since it would depend on Czech provocation. Von Ribbentrop\r\n    repeated that whoever desires revision must exploit the good\r\n    opportunity and participate.\r\n\r\n    “The Hungarian reply thus, remained a conditional one. Upon, the\r\n    question of von Ribbentrop, what purpose the desired General\r\n    Staff conferences were to have, not much more was brought\r\n    forward than the Hungarian desire of a mutual inventory of\r\n    military material and preparedness for the Czech conflict. The\r\n    clear political basis for such a conference—the time of\r\n    Hungarian intervention—was not obtained.\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime, more positive language was used by von Horthy\r\n    in his talk with the Fuehrer. He wished not to hide his doubts\r\n    with regard to the English attitude, but he wished to put\r\n    Hungary’s intention to participate on record. The Hungarian\r\n    Ministers were and remained, even later, more skeptical since\r\n    they feel more strongly about the immediate danger for Hungary\r\n    with its unprotected flanks.\r\n\r\n    “When von Imredy had a discussion with the Fuehrer in the\r\n    afternoon, he was very relieved _when the Fuehrer explained to\r\n    him, that, in regard to the situation in question, he demanded\r\n    nothing of Hungary_. He himself would not know the time. Whoever\r\n    wanted to join the meal would have to participate in the cooking\r\n    as well. Should Hungary wish conferences of the General Staffs,\r\n    he would have no objections.” (_2796-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy the third day of the conference the Germans were able to note that in\r\nthe event of a German-Czech conflict Hungary would be sufficiently armed\r\nfor participation on 1 October. Another captured German Foreign Office\r\nMemorandum reports a conversation between Ribbentrop and Kanya on 25\r\nAugust 1938. The last paragraph of this memorandum states:\r\n\r\n    “Concerning Hungary’s military preparedness in case of a\r\n    German-Czech conflict von Kanya mentioned several days ago that\r\n    his country would need a period of one to two years in order to\r\n    develop adequately the armed strength of Hungary. During today’s\r\n    conversation von Kanya corrected this remark and said that\r\n    Hungary’s military situation was much better. His country would\r\n    be ready, as far as armaments were concerned, to take part in\r\n    the conflict by October 1st of this year.” (_2797-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe signature to this document is not clear, but it appears to be that\r\nof von Weizsäcker.\r\n\r\nThese accounts of the German-Hungarian conference are corroborated by\r\nGeneral Jodl’s diary. The entry for 21-26 August reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_21-26 August_:\r\n\r\n    “Visit to Germany of the Hungarian Regent (_Reichsverweser_).\r\n    Accompanied by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign\r\n    Affairs and the Honved Minister v. Raatz.\r\n\r\n    “They arrive with the idea that in the course of a great war,\r\n    after a few years, and with the help of German troops, the old\r\n    state of Hungary can be reestablished. They leave with the\r\n    understanding that we have neither demands from, nor claims\r\n    against them, but that Germany will not stand for a second\r\n    provocation by Czechoslovakia, even if it should be tomorrow. If\r\n    they want to participate at that moment, it is up to them.\r\n\r\n    “Germany, however, will never play the role of arbitrator\r\n    between them and Poland. The Hungarians agree; but they believe\r\n    that, when the issue arises, a period of 48 hours would be\r\n    indispensable to them to find out Yugoslavia’s attitude.”\r\n    (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the talks with the Hungarians proved to be a staff\r\nconference on 6 September. Jodl’s diary entry for that day states:\r\n\r\n    “_6 September_:\r\n\r\n    “Chief of General Staff, General of Artillery Halder, has a\r\n    conference with the Hungarian Chief of General Staff Fischer.\r\n\r\n    “Before that he is briefed by me on the political attitude of\r\n    the Fuehrer—especially his order not to give any hint on the\r\n    exact moment. The same with OQI, General v. Stuelpnagel.”\r\n    (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nG. _Final Preparations for the Attack._\r\n\r\nThe setting in which these events took place was that of the Munich Pact\r\nand the international crisis which led to it. As this crisis was\r\ndeveloping in August and September 1938, frantic efforts were being made\r\nby the statesmen of the world to preserve the peace of the world. These\r\nstatesmen, unfortunately, were unaware of the plans and designs of the\r\nNazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe documents captured by Allied troops reveal the hitherto-unknown\r\nstory underlying the Pact of Munich. These papers reveal the fraud and\r\ndeceit practiced by the Nazi conspirators in negotiating the Pact of\r\nMunich as a stepping-stone toward further aggression. The hope for peace\r\nwhich came with the Munich Pact, which later turned out to be a snare\r\nand a deceit, was a trap carefully set by the Nazi conspirators. The\r\nnature of the trap is indicated by the events of the weeks just\r\npreceding the Munich agreement.\r\n\r\nWith a 1 October target date set for Case Green, there was a noticeable\r\nincrease in the tempo of the military preparations in late August and\r\nSeptember. Actual preparations for the attack on Czechoslovakia were\r\nwell under way. The agenda of the Nazi conspirators were devoted to\r\ntechnical details: the timing of X-day, questions of mobilization,\r\nquestions of transport and supply.\r\n\r\nOn 26 August Jodl initialed a memorandum entitled “Timing of the X-Order\r\nand the Question of Advance Measures” (_388-PS, Item 17_). This\r\nmemorandum demonstrates clearly the complicity of the OKW and of Keitel\r\nand Jodl, in the fabrication of an incident as an excuse for war. It\r\nreveals the character of the attack that Germany was preparing to\r\nlaunch. The memorandum reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_TIMING OF THE X-ORDER AND THE QUESTION OF ADVANCE MEASURES_\r\n\r\n    “The Luftwaffe’s endeavor to take the enemy air forces by\r\n    surprise at their peace-time airports justifiably leads them to\r\n    oppose measures taken in advance of the X-order and to the\r\n    demand that the X-order itself be given sufficiently late on X\r\n    minus 1 to prevent the fact of Germany’s mobilization becoming\r\n    known to Czechoslovakia on that day.\r\n\r\n    “The army’s efforts are tending in the opposite direction. It\r\n    intends to let OKW initiate all advance measures between X minus\r\n    3 and X minus 1, which will contribute to the smooth and rapid\r\n    working of the mobilization. With this in mind OKW _also\r\n    demands_ that the X order be given _not later than 1400 on X\r\n    minus 1_.\r\n\r\n    “To this the following must be said:\r\n\r\n    “Operation (Aktion) Green will be set in motion by means of an\r\n    ‘incident’ in Czechoslovakia which will give Germany provocation\r\n    for military intervention. The fixing of the _exact time_ for\r\n    this incident is of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n    “It must come at a time when weather conditions are favorable\r\n    for our superior air forces to go into action and at an hour\r\n    which will enable authentic news of it to reach us on the\r\n    afternoon of X minus 1.\r\n\r\n    “It can then be spontaneously answered by the giving of the X\r\n    order at 1400 on X minus 1.\r\n\r\n    “On X minus 2 the Navy, Army and Air Force will merely receive\r\n    an advance warning.\r\n\r\n    “If the _Fuehrer_ intends to follow this plan of action, all\r\n    further discussion is superfluous.\r\n\r\n    “For then no advance measures may be taken before X minus 1 for\r\n    which there is not an innocent explanation as we shall otherwise\r\n    appear to have manufactured the incident. Orders for absolutely\r\n    essential advance measures must be given in good time and\r\n    camouflaged with the help of the numerous maneuvers and\r\n    exercises.\r\n\r\n    “Also, the question raised by the Foreign Office as to whether\r\n    all Germans should be called back in time from prospective enemy\r\n    territories must in no way lead to the conspicuous departure\r\n    from Czechoslovakia of any German subjects before the incident.\r\n\r\n    “Even a warning of the diplomatic representatives in Prague is\r\n    impossible before the first air-attack, although the\r\n    consequences could be very grave in the event of their becoming\r\n    victims of such an attack (e.g., death of representatives of\r\n    friendly or confirmed neutral powers.)\r\n\r\n    “If, for technical reasons, the _evening hours_ should be\r\n    considered desirable for the incident, then the following day\r\n    cannot be X day, but it must be the day after that.\r\n\r\n    “In any case we must act on the principle that nothing must be\r\n    done before the incident which might point to mobilization, and\r\n    that the swiftest possible action must be taken after the\r\n    incident. (X-Fall)\r\n\r\n    “It is the purpose of these notes to point out what a great\r\n    interest the _Wehrmacht_ has in the incident and that it must be\r\n    informed of the Fuehrer’s intentions in good time—insofar as\r\n    the _Abwehr_ Section is not also charged with the organization\r\n    of the incident.\r\n\r\n    “I request that the Fuehrer’s decision be obtained on these\r\n    points.\r\n\r\n                                                   “J [Jodl] 26/8.”\r\n                                                (_388-PS, Item 17_)\r\n\r\nIn handwriting at the bottom of the page are the notes of Schmundt,\r\nHitler’s adjutant. These reveal that the memorandum was submitted to\r\nHitler on 30 August; that Hitler agreed to act along these lines; and\r\nthat Jodl was so notified on 31 August.\r\n\r\nOn 3 September Keitel and von Brauchitsch met with Hitler at the\r\nBerghof. Again Schmundt kept notes of the conference (_388-PS, Item\r\n18_). The first three paragraphs of these minutes state:\r\n\r\n    “_Gen. Ob. v. Brauchitsch_: Reports on the exact time of the\r\n    transfer of the troops to ‘exercise areas’ for ‘_Gruen_’. Field\r\n    units to be transferred on 28 Sept. From here will then be ready\r\n    for action. When X Day becomes known, field units carry out\r\n    exercises in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n    “_Fuehrer_: Has objection. Troops assemble field units a 2-day\r\n    march away. Carry out camouflage exercises everywhere.\r\n\r\n    “?:        OKH must know when X-day is by 1200 noon, 27\r\n    September.” (_388-PS, Item 18_)\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the conference Hitler gave his views on the\r\nstrategy the German armies should employ and the strength of the Czech\r\ndefenses they would encounter. He spoke of the possibility of “drawing\r\nin the Henlein people.” The situation in the West still troubled him.\r\nSchmundt noted:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer gives orders for the development of the Western\r\n    fortifications; improvement of advance positions around Aachen\r\n    and Saarbrucken. Construction of 300 to 400 battery positions\r\n    (1600 artillery pieces.)” (_388-PS, Item 18_)\r\n\r\nFive days later General Stulpnagel asked Jodl for written assurance that\r\nthe OKH would be informed five days in advance about the pending action.\r\nIn the evening Jodl conferred with Luftwaffe generals about the\r\ncoordination of ground and air operations at the start of the attack.\r\nThe 8 September entry in General Jodl’s diary states:\r\n\r\n    “_8 September_:\r\n\r\n    “General Stulpnagel OQI asks for written assurance that the Army\r\n    High Command will be informed five days in advance if the plan\r\n    is to take place. I agree and add that the overall\r\n    meteorological situation can be estimated to some extent only\r\n    for two days in advance, and that therefore the plans may be\r\n    changed up to this moment (D-day-2) (X-2 TAGE).\r\n\r\n    “General Stulpnagel mentions that for the first time he wonders\r\n    whether the previous basis of the plan is not being abandoned.\r\n    It presupposed that the Western Powers would not interfere\r\n    decisively. It gradually seems as if the Fuehrer would stick to\r\n    his decision even though he may no longer be of this opinion. It\r\n    must be added that Hungary is at least moody and that Italy is\r\n    reserved.\r\n\r\n    “I must admit that I am worrying too, when comparing the change\r\n    of opinion about political and military potentialities,\r\n    according to directives of 24 June, 5 Nov 37, 7 Dec 37, 30 May\r\n    38, with the last statements.\r\n\r\n    “In spite of that one must be aware of the fact that the other\r\n    nations will do everything they can to apply pressure to us. We\r\n    must pass this test of nerves, but because only very few people\r\n    know the art of withstanding this pressure successfully, the\r\n    only possible solution is to inform only a very small circle of\r\n    officers of news that causes us anxiety, and not to have it\r\n    circulate through anterooms as heretofore.\r\n\r\n    “1800 hours to 2100 hours: Conference with Chief of Army High\r\n    Command and Chief of General Staff of the Air Force (present\r\n    were Jeschonnek, Kammhuber, Sternburg and myself).\r\n\r\n    “We agree about the promulgation of the D-Day order (X-Befehl),\r\n    (X-1, 4 o’clock) and preannouncement to the Air Force (D-Day-1,\r\n    X-1 day, 7 o’clock). The ‘Y time’ has yet to be examined; some\r\n    formations have an approach flight of one hour.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nLate on the evening of the following day, 9 September, Hitler met with\r\nKeitel and Generals von Brauchitsch and Halder at Nurnberg. Dr. Todt,\r\nthe construction engineer, later joined the conference, which lasted\r\nfrom 10 in the evening until 3:30 the following morning. Schmundt’s\r\nminutes are _Item 19_ in his file (_388-PS_). In this meeting General\r\nHalder reviewed the missions assigned to four of the German armies being\r\ncommitted to the attack: the 2d, 10th, 12th, and 14th. With his\r\ncharacteristic enthusiasm for military planning, Hitler then delivered a\r\nsoliloquy on strategic considerations which should be taken into account\r\nas the attack developed. The discussions proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_General Oberst v. Brauchitsch_: Employment of motorized\r\n    divisions was based on the difficult rail situation in Austria\r\n    and the difficulties in getting other divisions (ready to march)\r\n    into the area at the right time. In the West vehicles will have\r\n    to leave on the 20th of Sept, if X-Day remains as planned.\r\n    Workers leave on the 23d, by relays. Specialist workers remain\r\n    according to decision by Army Command 2.\r\n\r\n    “_The Fuehrer_: Doesn’t see why workers have to return home as\r\n    early as X-11. Other workers and people are also on the way on\r\n    mobilization day. Also the RR cars, they will stand around\r\n    unnecessarily later on.\r\n\r\n    “_General Keitel_: Workers are not under the jurisdiction of\r\n    district commands (Bezirks Kdos.) in the West. Trains must be\r\n    assembled.\r\n\r\n    “_v. Brauchitsch_: 235,000 men RAD (Labour Service) will be\r\n    drafted. 96 Construction Bns will be distributed (also in the\r\n    east). 40,000 trained laborers stay in the West.” (_388-PS, Item\r\n    19_)\r\n\r\nFrom this date forward the Nazi conspirators were occupied with the\r\nintricate planning required before the attack. On 11 September Jodl\r\nconferred with a representative of the Propaganda Ministry about methods\r\nof refuting German violations of International Law and exploiting those\r\nof the Czechs. The 11 September entry in the Jodl diary reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “_11 September_:\r\n\r\n    “In the afternoon conference with Secretary of State Jahnke from\r\n    the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on imminent\r\n    common tasks.\r\n\r\n    “The joint preparations for refutation (_Wiederlegung_) of our\r\n    own violations of international law, and the exploitation of its\r\n    violations by the enemy, were considered particularly\r\n    important.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis discussion developed into a detailed study compiled by Section L,\r\nJodl’s section of the OKW (_C-2_). Seven copies of this captured\r\ndocument were prepared and distributed on 1 October 1938 to the OKH, the\r\nOKM, the Luftwaffe, and the Foreign Office. In this study anticipated\r\nviolations of International Law in the invasion of Czechoslovakia are\r\nlisted and counter-propaganda suggested for the use of the propaganda\r\nagencies. This document is presented in a tabular form, in which\r\npossible incidents are listed in the left-hand column. In the second\r\ncolumn are given specific examples of the incidents; in the third and\r\nfourth columns the position to be taken toward these incidents under\r\nInternational Law and under the laws of warfare is set forth; the fifth\r\ncolumn, which is blank, is reserved for the explanation to be offered by\r\nthe Propaganda Minister. The first 10 hypothetical incidents, for which\r\njustification must be found, and which are listed in column b of the\r\ntable are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1_a_. In an air-raid on Prague the British Embassy is\r\n    destroyed.\r\n\r\n    “2. Englishmen or Frenchmen are injured or killed;\r\n\r\n    “3. The Hradschin is destroyed in an air raid on Prague.\r\n\r\n    “4. On account of a report that the Czechs have used gas, the\r\n    firing of gas projectiles is ordered.\r\n\r\n    “5. Czech civilians, not recognizable as soldiers, are caught in\r\n    the act of sabotage (destruction of important bridges,\r\n    destruction of foodstuffs and fodder) are discovered looting\r\n    wounded or dead soldiers and thereupon shot.\r\n\r\n    “6. Captured Czech soldiers or Czech civilians are detailed to\r\n    do road work or to load munitions.\r\n\r\n    “7. For military reasons it is necessary to requisition billets,\r\n    foodstuffs and fodder from the Czech population. As a result the\r\n    latter suffer from want.\r\n\r\n    “8. Czech population is, for military reasons, compulsorily\r\n    evacuated to the rear area.\r\n\r\n    “9. Churches are used for military accommodation.\r\n\r\n    “10. In the course of their duty, German aircraft fly over\r\n    Polish territory where they are involved in an air battle with\r\n    Czech aircraft.” (_C-2_)\r\n\r\nFrom Nurnberg, on 10 September, Hitler issued an order bringing the\r\n_Reichsarbeitsdienst_, the German labor service, under the OKW. This top\r\nsecret order, of which 25 copies were made, provides as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. The whole RAD organization comes under the command of the\r\n    Supreme Command of the Army effective 15 September.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Chief of OKW decides on the first commitments of this\r\n    organization in conjunction with the Reichs Labor Leader\r\n    (_Reichsarbeitsfuehrer_) and on assignments from time to time to\r\n    the Supreme Commands of the Navy, Army and Air Force. Where\r\n    questions arise with regard to competency he will make a final\r\n    decision in accordance with my instructions.\r\n\r\n    “3. For the time being this order is to be made known only to\r\n    the departments and personnel immediately concerned.\r\n\r\n                                          “(signed)  ADOLF HITLER.”\r\n                                                (_388-PS, Item 20_)\r\n\r\nFour days later, on 14 September, Keitel issued detailed instructions\r\nfor the employment of specific RAD units. This order is _Item 21_ in the\r\nSchmundt file. A further order issued by Jodl on 16 September specified\r\nRAD units which would receive military training. This is _Item 24_ in\r\nthe Schmundt file. (_388-PS_)\r\n\r\nTwo entries in Jodl’s diary give further indications of the problems of\r\nthe OKW in this period of mid-September, just two weeks before the\r\nanticipated X-day. The entries for 15 and 16 September read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_15 September_:\r\n\r\n    “In the morning conference with Chief of Army High Command and\r\n    Chief of General Staffs of Army and Air Forces; the question was\r\n    discussed what could be done if the Fuehrer insists on\r\n    advancement of the date, due to the rapid development of the\r\n    situation.\r\n\r\n    “_16 September_:\r\n\r\n    “General Keitel returns from the Berghof at 1700 hours. He\r\n    graphically describes the results of the conference between\r\n    Chamberlain and the Fuehrer. The next conference will take place\r\n    on the 21st or 22nd in Godesberg.\r\n\r\n    “With consent of the Fuehrer, the order is given in the evening\r\n    by the Armed Forces High Command to the Army High Command and to\r\n    the Ministry of Finance, to line up the VGAD along the Czech\r\n    border.\r\n\r\n    “In the same way, an order is issued to the railways to have the\r\n    empty rolling stock kept in readiness clandestinely for the\r\n    strategic concentrations of the Army, so that it can be\r\n    transported starting 28 September.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe order to the railroads to make rolling stock available which General\r\nJodl referred to appears as _Item 22_ in the Schmundt file. In this\r\norder Keitel told the railroads to be ready by 28 September but to\r\ncontinue work on the western fortifications even after 20 September in\r\nthe interest of camouflage. The first and fourth paragraphs of this\r\norder provide:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsbahn must provide trains of empty trucks in great\r\n    numbers by September 28 for the carrying out of mobilization\r\n    exercises. This task now takes precedence over all others.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “However, in accordance with the Fuehrer’s directive, every\r\n    effort should be made to continue to supply the materials in as\r\n    large quantities as feasible even after 20 September 1938, and\r\n    this for reasons of camouflage as well as in order to continue\r\n    the important work of the Lines.” (_388-PS, Item 22_)\r\n\r\nThe penultimate stage of the aggression began on 18 September. From that\r\nday until the 28th a series of orders were issued advancing preparations\r\nfor the attack. These orders are included in the Schmundt file\r\n(_388-PS_). On the 18th the commitment schedule for the five\r\nparticipating armies—the 2d, 8th, 10th, 12th, and 14th—was set forth\r\n(_388-PS, Item 26_). Hitler approved the secret mobilization of five\r\ndivisions in the west to protect the German rear during Case Green\r\n(_388-PS, Item 31_). Further discussions were held between the Army and\r\nthe Luftwaffe about the time of day for the attack. Conference notes\r\ninitialed by Jodl and dated 27 September reveal the difference in views.\r\nThese notes are _Item 54_ in the Schmundt file. The first three\r\nparagraphs read:\r\n\r\n    “_COORDINATED TIME OF ATTACK BY ARMY AND AIR FORCES ON X DAY._\r\n\r\n    “As a matter of principle, every effort should be made for a\r\n    coordinated attack by Army and Air Forces on X Day.\r\n\r\n    “The Army wishes to attack at dawn, i.e., about 0615. It also\r\n    wishes to conduct some limited operations in the previous night,\r\n    which however, would not alarm the entire Czech front.\r\n\r\n    “Air Force’s time of attack depends on weather conditions. These\r\n    could change the time of attack and also limit the area of\r\n    operations. The weather of the last few days, for instance,\r\n    would have delayed the start until between 0800 and 1100 due to\r\n    low ceiling in Bavaria.” (_388-PS, Item 54_)\r\n\r\nA satisfactory solution appears to have been arrived at. The last two\r\nparagraphs read:\r\n\r\n    “_Thus it is proposed_:\r\n\r\n    “Attack by the Army—independent of the attack by the air\r\n    force—at the time desired by the Army (0615) and permission for\r\n    limited operations to take place before then, however, only to\r\n    an extent that will not alarm the entire Czech front.\r\n\r\n    “The Luftwaffe will attack at a time most suitable to them.\r\n\r\n                                          (J)”  (_388-PS, Item 54_)\r\n\r\nOn the same day, 27 September, Keitel sent a most secret memorandum to\r\nHess and the Reichsfuehrer SS, Himmler, for the guidance of Nazi Party\r\nofficials. This memorandum is _Item 32_ in the Schmundt file. It directs\r\nthe Party officials and organizations to comply with the demands of the\r\nArmy during the secret mobilization in such matters as turning over\r\nequipment and facilities. The first four paragraphs of this message\r\nread:\r\n\r\n    “As a result of the political situation the Fuehrer and\r\n    Chancellor has ordered mobilization measures for the Armed\r\n    Forces, without the political situation being aggravated by\r\n    issuing the mobilization (X) order or corresponding code-words.\r\n\r\n    “Within the framework of these mobilization measures it is\r\n    necessary for the Armed Forces authorities to issue demands to\r\n    the various Party authorities and their organizations, which are\r\n    connected with the previous issuing of the mobilization order,\r\n    the advance measures or special code names.\r\n\r\n    “The special situation makes it necessary that these demands be\r\n    met (even if the code word has not been previously issued)\r\n    immediately and without being referred to higher authorities.\r\n\r\n    “OKW requests that subordinate offices be given immediate\r\n    instructions to this effect so that the mobilization of the\r\n    Armed Forces can be carried out according to plan.” (_388-PS,\r\n    Item 32_)\r\n\r\nTwo additional entries from Jodl’s diary reveal the extent to which the\r\nNazi conspirators carried forward their preparations for attack even\r\nduring the period of the negotiations which culminated in the Munich\r\nAgreement. The entries for 26 and 27 September read:\r\n\r\n    “_26 September_:\r\n\r\n    “Chief of the Armed Forces High Command, acting through the Army\r\n    High Command, has stopped the intended approach march of the\r\n    advance units to the Czech border, because it is not yet\r\n    necessary and because the Fuehrer does not intend to march in\r\n    before the 30th in any case. Order to approach towards the Czech\r\n    frontier need be given on the 27th only.\r\n\r\n    “In the evening of the 26th, fixed radio stations of Breslau,\r\n    Dresden and Vienna are put at the disposal of the Reich Ministry\r\n    for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda for interference with\r\n    possible Czech propaganda transmissions. “Question by Foreign\r\n    office whether Czechs are to be allowed to leave and cross\r\n    Germany. Decision from Chief of the Armed Forces High Command:\r\n    yes.\r\n\r\n    “1515 hours: The Chief of the Armed Forces High Command informs\r\n    General Stumpf about the result of the Godesberg conversations\r\n    and about the Fuehrer’s opinion. In no case will X day be before\r\n    the 30th.\r\n\r\n    “It is important that we do not permit ourselves to be drawn\r\n    into military engagements because of false reports, before\r\n    Prague replied.\r\n\r\n    “A question of Stumpf about Y hour results in the reply that on\r\n    account of the weather situation, a simultaneous intervention of\r\n    the Air Force and Army cannot be expected. The Army needs the\r\n    dawn, the Air Force can only start later on account of frequent\r\n    fogs.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has to make a decision for the commander in chief\r\n    who is to have priority.\r\n\r\n    “The opinion of Stumpf is also that the attack of the Army has\r\n    to proceed. The Fuehrer has not made any decision as yet about\r\n    commitment against Prague.\r\n\r\n    “2000 hours: The Fuehrer addresses the people and the world in\r\n    an important speech at the Sportspalast.\r\n\r\n    “_27 September_:\r\n\r\n    “1320 hours: The Fuehrer consents to the first wave of attack\r\n    being advanced to a line from where they can arrive in the\r\n    assembly area by 30 September.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe order referred to by General Jodl in the last entry was also\r\nrecorded by the faithful Schmundt. It appears as _Item 33_ of the file.\r\nIt is the order which brought the Nazi armies to the jumping-off point\r\nfor unprovoked aggression:\r\n\r\n                                                       “MOST SECRET\r\n                             “_MEMORANDUM_\r\n\r\n    “At 1300 September 27 the Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the\r\n    Armed Forces ordered the movement of the assault units from\r\n    their exercise areas to their jumping-off points.\r\n\r\n    “The assault units (about 21 reinforced regiments, or 7\r\n    divisions,) must be ready to begin the action against ‘_Gruen_’\r\n    on September 30, the decision having been made one day\r\n    previously by 1200 noon.” (_388-PS, Item 33_)\r\n\r\nThere follows a pencil note by Schmundt:\r\n\r\n    “This order was conveyed to General Keitel at 1320 through Major\r\n    Schmundt.” (_388-PS, Item 33_)\r\n\r\nH. _The Campaign Within Czechoslovakia._\r\n\r\nThe military preparations for aggression against Czechoslovakia had not\r\nbeen carried out in vacuo. They had been preceded by a skillfully\r\nconceived campaign designed to promote civil disobedience to the\r\nCzechoslovak State. Using the techniques they had already developed in\r\nother ventures, the Nazi conspirators over a period of years used money,\r\npropaganda, and force to undermine Czechoslovakia. In this program the\r\nNazis focussed their attention on the persons of German descent living\r\nin the Sudetenland, a mountainous area bounding Bohemia and Moravia on\r\nthe north, west, and south.\r\n\r\nThe Czechoslovak government’s official report for the prosecution and\r\ntrial of German major war criminals, entitled “German Crimes Against\r\nCzechoslovakia,” shows the background of the subsequent Nazi intrigue.\r\n(_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nNazi agitation in Czechoslovakia dated from the earliest days of the\r\nNSDAP. In the years following the First World War a German National\r\nSocialist Workers Party (DNSAP), which maintained close contact with\r\nHitler’s NSDAP, was active in the Sudetenland. In 1932, ring-leaders of\r\nthe _Sudeten Volksport_, an organization corresponding to the Nazi SA,\r\nopenly endorsed the 21 points of Hitler’s program, the first of which\r\ndemanded the union of all Germans in a Greater Germany. Soon thereafter\r\nthey were charged with planning armed rebellion on behalf of a foreign\r\npower and were sentenced for conspiracy against the Czech Republic. Late\r\nin 1933 the National Socialist Party of Czechoslovakia forestalled its\r\ndissolution by voluntary liquidation, and several of its chiefs escaped\r\nacross the frontier. For a year thereafter Nazi activity in\r\nCzechoslovakia continued underground. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 1 October 1934, with the approval and at the urging of the Nazi\r\nconspirators, Konrad Henlein, an instructor of gymnastics, established\r\nthe “German Home Front” (_Deutsche Heimatfront_), which the following\r\nspring became the Sudeten German Party (_Sudeten-deutsche Partei—SDP_).\r\nProfiting from the experience of the Czech National Socialist Party,\r\nHenlein denied any connection with the German Nazis. He rejected\r\npan-Germanism, and professed his respect for individual liberties and\r\nhis loyalty to “honest democracy” and to the Czech state. His party,\r\nnone-the-less, was built on the basis of the Nazi _Fuehrerprinzip_, and\r\nhe became its Fuehrer. By 1937, when the power of Hitler’s Germany had\r\nbecome manifest, Henlein and his followers were striking a more\r\naggressive note, demanding, without definition, “complete Sudeten\r\nautonomy“. The SDP laid proposals before the Czech Parliament which\r\nwould, in substance, have created a state within a state. (_998-PS_;\r\n_3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter the annexation of Austria in March 1938 the Henleinists, who were\r\nnow openly organized after the Nazi model, intensified their activity.\r\nUndisguised anti-Semitic propaganda started in the Henlein press; the\r\ncampaign against “bolshevism” was intensified; terrorism in the\r\nHenlein-dominated communities increased. A storm troop organization,\r\npatterned and trained on the principles of the Nazi SS, was established,\r\nknown as the FS (_Freiwilliger Selbstschutz_, or Voluntary Vigilantes).\r\nOn 24 April 1938, in a speech to the Party Congress in Karlovy Vary,\r\nHenlein came into the open with his “Karlsbad Program”. In this speech,\r\nwhich echoed Hitler in tone and substance, Henlein asserted the right of\r\nthe Sudeten-Germans to profess “German political philosophy”, which, it\r\nwas clear, meant National Socialism. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs the summer of 1938 wore on, the Henleinists used every technique of\r\nthe Nazi Fifth Column. As summarized in the Czech official report, these\r\nincluded:\r\n\r\n(1) _Espionage._ Military espionage was conducted by the SDP, the FS,\r\nand by other members of the German minority on behalf of Germany. Czech\r\ndefenses were mapped, and information on Czech troop movements was\r\nfurnished to the German authorities.\r\n\r\n(2) _Nazification of German Organizations in Czechoslovakia._ The\r\nHenleinists systematically penetrated the whole life of the German\r\npopulation of Czechoslovakia. Associations and social and cultural\r\ncenters gradually underwent “_Gleichschaltung_”, i.e., “purification”,\r\nby the SDP. Among the organizations conquered by the Henleinists were\r\nsport societies, rowing clubs, associations of ex-service men, and\r\nchoral societies. The Henleinists were particularly interested in\r\npenetrating as many business institutions as possible and in bringing\r\nover to their side the directors of banks, the owners or directors of\r\nfactories, and the managers of commercial firms. In the case of Jewish\r\nownership or direction they attempted to secure the cooperation of the\r\nclerical and technical staffs of the institution.\r\n\r\n(3) _German Direction and Leadership._ The Henleinists maintained\r\npermanent contact with the Nazi officials designated to direct\r\noperations within Czechoslovakia. Meetings in Germany at which\r\nHenleinists were exhorted and instructed in Fifth Column activity were\r\ncamouflaged by being held in conjunction with _Saenger Feste_ (choral\r\nfestivals), gymnastic shows and assemblies, and commercial gatherings\r\nsuch as the Leipzig Fair. Whenever the Nazi conspirators needed\r\nincidents for their war of nerves, it was the duty of the Henleinists to\r\nsupply them.\r\n\r\n(4) _Propaganda._ Disruptive and subversive propaganda was beamed at\r\nCzechoslovakia in German broadcasts and was echoed in the German press.\r\nGoebbels called Czechoslovakia a “nest of Bolshevism” and spread the\r\nfalse report of “Russian troops and airplanes” centered in Prague. Under\r\ndirection from the Reich the Henleinists maintained whispering\r\npropaganda in the Sudetenland, which contributed to the mounting tension\r\nand to the creation of incidents. Illegal Nazi literature was smuggled\r\nfrom Germany and widely distributed in the border regions. The Henlein\r\npress more or less openly espoused Nazi ideology to the German\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n(5) _Murder and Terrorism._ The Nazi conspirators provided the\r\nHenleinists, and particularly the FS, with money and arms with which to\r\nprovoke incidents and to maintain a state of permanent unrest.\r\nGendarmes, customs officers, and other Czech officials were attacked. A\r\nboycott was established against Jewish lawyers, doctors, and tradesmen.\r\nThe Henleinists terrorized the non-Henlein population, and the Nazi\r\nGestapo crossed into border districts to carry Czechoslovak citizens\r\nacross the border to Germany. In several cases political foes of the\r\nNazis were murdered on Czech soil. Nazi agents murdered Professor\r\nTheodor Lessing in 1933 and the engineer Formis in 1935. Both men were\r\nanti-Nazis who had escaped from Germany after Hitler came to power and\r\nhad sought refuge in Czechoslovakia. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, when there was no longer need for pretense and\r\ndeception, Konrad Henlein made a clear and frank statement of the\r\nmission assigned to him by the Nazi conspirators. This statement was\r\nmade in a lecture by Konrad Henlein quoted on page 29 of “Four Fighting\r\nYears”, a publication of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\nIn this lecture, delivered by Henlein on 4 March 1941 in the Auditorium\r\nof the University of Vienna under the auspices of the _Wiener\r\nVerwaltungsakadamie_, he discussed the “fight for the liberation of the\r\nSudetens” in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “National Socialism soon swept over us Sudeten-Germans. Our\r\n    struggle was of a different character from that in Germany.\r\n    Although we had to behave differently in public we were, of\r\n    course, secretly in touch with the National Socialist revolution\r\n    in Germany so that we might be a part of it. The struggle for\r\n    Greater Germany was waged on Sudeten soil, too. This struggle\r\n    could be waged only by those inspired by the spirit of National\r\n    Socialism, persons who were true followers of our Fuehrer,\r\n    whatever their outward appearance. Fate sought me out to be the\r\n    leader of the national group in its final struggle. When * * *\r\n    in autumn, 1933, the leaders of the NSDAP asked me to take over\r\n    the political leadership of the Sudeten-Germans, I had a\r\n    difficult problem to solve. Should the National Socialist Party\r\n    continue to be carried on illegally or should the movement, in\r\n    the interest of the self-preservation of the Sudeten-Germans and\r\n    in order to prepare their return to the Reich, wage its struggle\r\n    under camouflage and by methods which appeared quite legal to\r\n    the outside world? For us Sudeten-Germans only the second\r\n    alternative seemed possible, for the preservation of our\r\n    national group was at stake. It would certainly have been easier\r\n    to exchange this hard and mentally exhausting struggle for the\r\n    heroic gesture of confessing allegiance to National Socialism\r\n    and entering a Czechoslovak prison. But it seemed more than\r\n    doubtful whether by this means we could have fulfilled the\r\n    political task of destroying Czechoslovakia as a bastion in the\r\n    alliance against the German Reich.” (_2863-PS_)\r\n\r\nI. _Evidence Implicating Nazi Conspirators in Czechoslovak Agitation._\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account of Nazi intrigue in Czechoslovakia is the outline\r\nof this conspiracy as it had been pieced together by the Czechoslovak\r\ngovernment early in the summer of 1945. Since then captured documents\r\nand other information made available since the defeat of Germany have\r\nclearly and conclusively demonstrated the implication, which hitherto\r\ncould only be deduced, of the Nazi conspirators in the Sudetenland\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nA telegram sent from the German Legation in Prague on 16 March 1938 to\r\nthe Foreign Office in Berlin, presumably written by the German Minister,\r\nEisenlohr, proves conclusively that the Henlein movement was an\r\ninstrument of the Nazi conspirators (_3060-PS_). The Henlein party, it\r\nappears from this telegram, was directed from Berlin and from the German\r\nLegation in Prague. It could have no policy of its own; even the\r\nspeeches of its leaders had to be coordinated with the German\r\nauthorities. This telegram reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Rebuff to Frank has had a salutary effect. Have thrashed out\r\n    matters with Henlein, who recently had shunned me, and with\r\n    Frank separately and received following promises;\r\n\r\n    “1. The line of German Foreign Policy as transmitted by the\r\n    German Legation is exclusively decisive for policy and tactics\r\n    of the Sudeten German Party. My directives are to be complied\r\n    with implicitly.\r\n\r\n    “2. Public speeches and the press will be coordinated uniformly\r\n    with my approval. The editorial staff of “_Zeit_” (Time) is to\r\n    be improved.\r\n\r\n    “3. Party leadership abandons the former intransigent line which\r\n    in the end might lead to political complications and adopts a\r\n    line of gradual promotion of Sudeten-German interests. The\r\n    objectives are to be set in every case with my participation and\r\n    to be promoted by parallel diplomatic action. Laws for the\r\n    protection of nationalities (_Volksschutzgesetze_) and\r\n    ‘territorial autonomy’ are no longer to be stressed.\r\n\r\n    “4. If consultations with Berlin agencies are required or\r\n    desired before Henlein issues important statements on his\r\n    program, they are to be applied for and prepared through the\r\n    Mission.\r\n\r\n    “5. All information of the Sudeten German Party for German\r\n    agencies is to be transmitted through the Legation.\r\n\r\n    “6. Henlein will establish contact with me every week, and will\r\n    come to Prague at any time if requested.\r\n\r\n    “I now hope to have the Sudeten German Party under firm control,\r\n    as this is more than ever necessary for coming developments in\r\n    the interest of foreign policy. Please inform ministries\r\n    concerned and Mittelstelle (Central Office for Racial Germans)\r\n    and request them to support this uniform direction of the\r\n    Sudeten German Party.” (_3060-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe dressing-down administered by Eisenlohr to Henlein had the desired\r\neffect. The day after the telegram was dispatched from Prague, Henlein\r\naddressed a humble letter to Ribbentrop, asking an early personal\r\nconversation (_2789-PS_). This letter, dated 17 March 1938, and captured\r\nin the German Foreign Office files, states:\r\n\r\n    “Most honored Minister of Foreign Affairs:\r\n\r\n    “In our deeply felt joy over the fortunate turn of events in\r\n    Austria we feel it our duty to express our gratitude to all\r\n    those who had a share in this new grand achievement of our\r\n    Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “I beg you, most honored Minister, to accept accordingly the\r\n    sincere thanks of the Sudeten-Germans herewith.\r\n\r\n    “We shall show our appreciation to the Fuehrer by doubled\r\n    efforts in the service of the Greater German policy.\r\n\r\n    “The new situation requires a reexamination of the Sudeten\r\n    German policy. For this purpose I beg to ask you for the\r\n    opportunity for a very early personal talk.\r\n\r\n    “In view of the necessity of such a clarification I have\r\n    postponed the Nation-wide Party Congress, originally scheduled\r\n    for 26th and 27th of March, 1938, for 4 weeks.\r\n\r\n    “I would appreciate if the Minister, Dr. Eisenlohr, and one of\r\n    my closest associates would be allowed to participate in the\r\n    requested talks.\r\n\r\n                                                    “Heil Hitler,\r\n                                                   “Loyally yours,\r\n                                             “/s/  Konrad Henlein.”\r\n                                                        (_2789-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis letter makes it clear that Henlein was quite aware that the seizure\r\nof Austria made possible the adoption of a new policy toward\r\nCzechoslovakia. It also reveals that he was already in close enough\r\ncontact with Ribbentrop and the German minister in Prague to feel free\r\nto suggest “early personal” talks.\r\n\r\nRibbentrop was not unreceptive to Henlein’s suggestion. The\r\nconversations Henlein had proposed took place in the Foreign Office in\r\nBerlin on 29 March 1938. The previous day Henlein had conferred with\r\nHitler himself. The captured German Foreign Office notes of the\r\nconference on 29 March read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsminister started out by emphasizing the necessity to\r\n    keep the conference which had been scheduled strictly a secret;\r\n    he then explained, in view of the directives which the Fuehrer\r\n    himself had given to Konrad Henlein personally yesterday\r\n    afternoon that there were two questions which were of\r\n    outstanding importance for the conduct of policy of the Sudeten\r\n    German Party * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The aim of the negotiations to be carried out by the Sudeten\r\n    German party with the Czechoslovakian Government is finally\r\n    this: to avoid entry into the Government by the extension and\r\n    gradual specification of the demands to be made. It must be\r\n    emphasized clearly in the negotiations that the Sudeten German\r\n    Party alone is the party to the negotiations with the\r\n    Czechoslovakian Government, not the Reich Cabinet\r\n    (_Reichsregierung_). The Reich Cabinet itself must refuse to\r\n    appear toward the Government in Prague or toward London and\r\n    Paris as the advocate or peacemaker of the Sudeten German\r\n    demands. It is a self-evident prerequisite that during the\r\n    impending discussion with the Czechoslovak Government the\r\n    Sudeten-Germans would be firmly controlled by Konrad Henlein,\r\n    would maintain quiet and discipline, and would avoid\r\n    indiscretions. The assurances already given by Konrad Henlein in\r\n    this connection were satisfactory.\r\n\r\n    “Following these general explanations of the Reich Minister the\r\n    demands of the Sudeten German Party from the Czechoslovak\r\n    Government as contained in the enclosure were discussed and\r\n    approved in principle. For further cooperation, Konrad Henlein\r\n    was instructed to keep in the closest possible touch with the\r\n    Reichminister and the Head of the Central Office for Racial\r\n    Germans (_mit dem Leiter der Volksdeutschen Mittelstelle_), as\r\n    well as the German Minister in Prague, as the local\r\n    representative of the Foreign Minister. The task of the German\r\n    Minister in Prague would be to support the demands of the\r\n    Sudeten German Party as reasonable, not officially, but in more\r\n    private talks with the Czechoslovak politicians without exerting\r\n    any direct influence on the extent of the demands of the Party.\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion there was a discussion whether it would be useful\r\n    if the Sudeten German Party would cooperate with other\r\n    minorities in Czechoslovakia, especially with the Slovaks. The\r\n    Foreign Minister decided that the Party should have the\r\n    discretion to keep a loose contact with other minority groups if\r\n    the adoption of a parallel course by them might appear\r\n    appropriate.\r\n\r\n                                          “Berlin, 29 March 1938.\r\n                                                      “R [Initial]”\r\n                                                        (_2788-PS_)\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting aspect of this secret meeting is the list of\r\nthose who attended. Konrad Henlein, his principal deputy, Karl Hermann\r\nFrank, and two others represented the Sudeten German Party. Professor\r\nHaushofer and SS Obergruppenfuehrer Lorenz represented the\r\n_Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle_, the Central Office for Racial Germans. The\r\nForeign Office was represented by a delegation of eight. These eight\r\nincluded Ribbentrop, who presided at the meeting and did most of the\r\ntalking, von Mackensen, Weiszacker, and Minister Eisenlohr from the\r\nGerman Legation at Prague. (_2788-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn May Henlein came to Berlin for more conversations with the Nazi\r\nconspirators. At this time the plans for Case Green, the attack on\r\nCzechoslovakia, were already on paper, and it may be assumed that\r\nHenlein was briefed on the role he was to play during the summer months.\r\nThe entry for 22 May 1938 in General Jodl’s diary reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “22 May: Fundamental conference between the Fuehrer and K.\r\n    Henlein” (see enclosure). (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe enclosure, unfortunately, is missing.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in his speech in Vienna, Henlein had admitted\r\nthat he had been selected by the Nazi conspirators in the fall of 1933\r\nto take over the political leadership of the Sudeten Germans\r\n(_2863-PS_). The foregoing documents show conclusively the nature of\r\nHenlein’s mission. They demonstrate that Henlein’s policy, his\r\npropaganda, even his speeches were controlled by Berlin. Furthermore,\r\nfrom the year 1935 the Sudeten German Party had been secretly subsidized\r\nby the German Foreign Office. A secret memorandum, captured in the\r\nGerman Foreign Office files, signed by Woermann and dated Berlin, 19\r\nAugust 1938, was occasioned by the request of the Henlein Party for\r\nadditional funds. This memorandum reads:\r\n\r\n                              “MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n    “The Sudeten German Party has been subsidized by the Foreign\r\n    Office regularly since 1935 with certain amounts, consisting of\r\n    a monthly payment of 15,000 Marks; 12,000 Marks of this are\r\n    transmitted to the Prague Legation for disbursement, and 3000\r\n    Marks are paid out to the Berlin representation of the party\r\n    (Bureau Buerger). In the course of the last few months the tasks\r\n    assigned to the Bureau Buerger have increased considerably due\r\n    to the current negotiations with the Czech Government. The\r\n    number of pamphlets and maps which are produced and disseminated\r\n    has risen; the propaganda activity in the press has grown\r\n    immensely; the expense accounts have increased especially\r\n    because due to the necessity for continuous good information,\r\n    the expenses for trips to Prague, London, and Paris (including\r\n    the financing of travels of Sudeten-German deputies and agents)\r\n    have grown considerably heavier. Under these conditions the\r\n    Bureau Buerger is no longer able to get along with the monthly\r\n    allowance of 3000 Marks if it is to do everything required.\r\n    Therefore, Mr. Buerger has applied to this office for an\r\n    increase of this amount, from 3000 Marks to 5500 Marks monthly.\r\n    In view of the considerable increase in the business transacted\r\n    by the Bureau, and of the importance which marks the activity of\r\n    the Bureau in regard to the cooperation with the Foreign Office,\r\n    this desire deserves the strongest support.\r\n\r\n    “Herewith submitted to the Dep: Pers(onnel) with a request for\r\n    approval.

About the first of August the Air Attache\r\nat the German Legation in Prague, Major Moericke, acting on instructions\r\nfrom Luftwaffe headquarters in Berlin, visited the Sudeten-German leader\r\nin Freudenthal. With his assistance, and in the company of the local\r\nleader of the FS (the Henlein equivalent of the SS), he reconnoitered\r\nthe surrounding countryside to select possible airfield sites for German\r\nuse. The FS leader, a Czech reservist then on leave, was in the uniform\r\nof the Czech army—a fact which, the attache noted, served as excellent\r\ncamouflage.\r\n\r\nThe Air Attache’s report reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The manufacturer M. is head of the Sudeten-German Glider Pilots\r\n    in Freudenthal and said to be absolutely reliable by my trusted\r\n    men. My personal impression fully confirmed this judgment. No\r\n    hint of my identity was made to him, although I had the\r\n    impression that M. knew who I was.\r\n\r\n    “At my request, with which he complied without any question, M.\r\n    travelled with me over the country in question. We used M.’s\r\n    private car for the trip.\r\n\r\n    “As M. did not know the country around Beneschau sufficiently\r\n    well, he took with him the local leader of the FS, a Czech\r\n    reservist of the Sudeten German Racial Group, at the time on\r\n    leave. He was in uniform. For reasons of camouflage I was\r\n    entirely in agreement with this—without actually saying so.\r\n\r\n    “As M., during the course of the drive, observed that I\r\n    photographed large open spaces out of the car, he said ‘Aha, so\r\n    you’re looking for airfields!’ I answered that we supposed that,\r\n    in the case of any serious trouble, the Czechs would put their\r\n    airfields immediately behind the line of fortifications and that\r\n    I had the intention of looking over the country from that point\r\n    of view.” (_1536-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the Air Attache’s report reference is made to the\r\npresence of reliable agents and informers (_V-Leute_) apparently drawn\r\nfrom the ranks of the Henlein Party in this area. It was indicated that\r\nthese agents were in touch with the _Abwehrstelle_, the intelligence\r\noffice in Breslau. (_1536-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn September, when the propaganda campaign was reaching its height, the\r\nNazis were not satisfied with playing merely on the Sudeten demands for\r\nautonomy. They attempted to use the Slovaks as well. On 19 September the\r\nForeign Office in Berlin sent the following telegram to the German\r\nLegation in Prague:\r\n\r\n    “Please inform deputy Kundt, at Konrad Henlein’s request, to get\r\n    into touch with the Slovaks at once and induce them to start\r\n    their demands for autonomy tomorrow.\r\n\r\n                                              “(signed)  ALTENBURG”\r\n                                                        (_2858-PS_)\r\n\r\nKundt was Henlein’s representative in Prague.\r\n\r\nAs the harassed Czech government sought to stem the disorder in the\r\nSudetenland, the German Foreign Office turned to threatening diplomatic\r\ntactics in a deliberate effort to increase the tension between the two\r\ncountries. Four telegrams from the Foreign Office in Berlin to the\r\nLegation in Prague, dispatched between the 16th and 24th of September\r\n1938, are self-explanatory. The first telegram is dated 16 September:\r\n\r\n    “Tonight 150 subjects of Czechoslovakia of Czech blood were\r\n    arrested in Germany. This measure is an answer to the arrest of\r\n    Sudeten-Germans since the Fuehrer’s speech of 12 September. I\r\n    request you to ascertain the number of Sudeten-Germans arrested\r\n    since 12 September as extensively as possible.

The first two paragraphs\r\nread:\r\n\r\n    “I. Request to inform the local government immediately of the\r\n    following:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Government has decided that:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Immediately as many Czech subjects of Czech descent,\r\n    Czech-speaking Jews included, will be arrested in Germany as\r\n    Sudeten-Germans have been in Czechoslovakia since the beginning\r\n    of the week.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) If any Sudeten-Germans should be executed pursuant to a\r\n    death sentence on the basis of martial law, an equal number of\r\n    Czechs will be shot in Germany.” (_2854-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe third telegram was sent on 24 September:\r\n\r\n    “According to information received here Czechs have arrested 2\r\n    German frontier-policemen, seven customs-officials and 30\r\n    railway-officials.

The last paragraph\r\nread:\r\n\r\n    “Confidential:\r\n\r\n    “Yielding of the Czech hostages arrested here for the prevention\r\n    of the execution of any sentences passed by military courts\r\n    against Sudeten-Germans is, of course, out of question.\r\n\r\n                                                         “WOERMANN”\r\n                                                        (_2856-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of September Henlein devoted himself and his\r\nfollowers wholeheartedly to preparation for the coming German attack.\r\nAbout 15 September, after Hitler’s provocative Nurnberg speech in which\r\nhe accused “this Benes” of “torturing” and planning the “extermination”\r\nof the Sudeten-Germans, Henlein and Karl Hermann Frank, one of his\r\nprincipal deputies, fled to Germany to avoid arrest by the Czech\r\ngovernment. In Germany Henlein broadcast over the powerful\r\n_Reichssender_ radio station his determination to lead the\r\nSudeten-Germans “home to the Reich” and denounced “the Hussite Bolshevik\r\ncriminals of Prague”. From his headquarters in a castle at Dondorf,\r\noutside Bayreuth, he kept in close touch with the leading Nazi\r\nconspirators, including Hitler and Himmler. He directed activities along\r\nthe border and began the organization of the Sudeten German Free Corps,\r\nan auxiliary military organization. These events are set forth in the\r\nCzechoslovak official report. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nHenlein’s activities were carried on with the advice and assistance of\r\nthe Nazi leaders. Lt. Col. Koechling was assigned to Henlein in an\r\nadvisory capacity to assist with the Sudeten German Free Corps. In a\r\nconference with Hitler on the night of 17 September Koechling received\r\nfar-reaching military powers. At this conference the purpose of the Free\r\nCorps was frankly stated: the “maintenance of disorder and clashes”.\r\n_Item 25_, of the Schmundt file (388-PS), a telegram labeled Most Secret\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Last night conference took place between Fuehrer and\r\n    Oberstleutnant Koechling. Duration of conference 7 minutes. Lt.\r\n    Col. Koechling remains directly responsible to OKW. He will be\r\n    assigned to Konrad Henlein in an advisory capacity. He received\r\n    far-reaching military plenary powers from the Fuehrer. The\r\n    Sudeten German Free Corps remains responsible to Konrad Henlein\r\n    alone. Purpose: Protection of the Sudeten-Germans and\r\n    maintenance of disturbances and clashes. The Free Corps will be\r\n    established in Germany. Armament only with Austrian weapons.\r\n    Activities of Free Corps to begin as soon as possible.”\r\n    (_388-PS, Item 25_)\r\n\r\nGeneral Jodl’s diary gives a further insight into the position of the\r\nHenlein Free Corps. At this time the Free Corps was engaged in active\r\nskirmishing along the Czech border, furnishing incidents and provocation\r\nin the desired manner. Jodl’s entries for 19 and 20 September 1938\r\nstate:\r\n\r\n    “_19 September_:\r\n\r\n    “Order is given to the Army High Command to take care of the\r\n    Sudeten German Free Corps.\r\n\r\n    “_20 September_:\r\n\r\n    “England and France have handed over their demands in Prague,\r\n    the contents of which are still unknown. The activities of the\r\n    Free Corps start assuming such an extent that they may bring\r\n    about, and already have brought about consequences harmful to\r\n    the plans of the Army. (Transferring rather strong units of the\r\n    Czech Army to the proximity of the border.) By checking with Lt.\r\n    Col. Koechling, I attempt to lead these activities into normal\r\n    channels.\r\n\r\n    “Toward the evening the Fuehrer also takes a hand and gives\r\n    permission to act only with groups up to 12 men each, after the\r\n    approval of the Corps HQ.” (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nA report from Henlein’s staff, which was filed in Hitler’s headquarters,\r\nboasted of the offensive operations of the Free Corps in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n    “Since 19 Sept.—in more than 300 missions—the Free Corps has\r\n    executed its task with an amazing spirit of _attack_ and with a\r\n    willingness often reaching a degree of unqualified\r\n    self-sacrifice. The result of the first phase of its activities:\r\n    more than 1500 prisoners, 25 MG’s and a large amount of other\r\n    weapons and equipment, aside from serious losses in dead and\r\n    wounded suffered by the _enemy_.” (_388-PS, Item 30_)\r\n\r\nIn this document the word “attack” was subsequently crossed out, and the\r\nword “defense” substituted. Similarly “the enemy” was changed to read\r\n“the Czech terrorists”.\r\n\r\nIn his headquarters in the castle at Dondorf, Henlein was in close touch\r\nwith Admiral Canaris of the Intelligence Division of the OKW and with\r\nthe SS and SA. The liaison officer between the SS and Henlein was\r\nOberfuehrer Gottlob Berger, who in later years became prominent in the\r\nSS command. An affidavit executed by Berger reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I, GOTTLOB BERGER, under oath and being previously sworn, make\r\n    the following statement:\r\n\r\n    “1. In the fall of 1938 I held the rank and title of Oberfuehrer\r\n    in the SS. In mid-September I was assigned as SS Liaison Officer\r\n    with Konrad Henlein’s Sudeten German Free Corps at their\r\n    headquarters in the castle of Dondorf outside Bayreuth. In this\r\n    position I was responsible for all liaison between the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler and Henlein and, in particular, I was\r\n    delegated to select from the Sudeten-Germans those who appeared\r\n    to be eligible for membership in the SS or VT (_Verfuegungs\r\n    Truppe_). In addition to myself, Liaison Officers stationed with\r\n    Henlein included an Obergruppenfuehrer from the NSKK, whose name\r\n    I have forgotten, and Obergruppenfuehrer Max Juettner, from the\r\n    SA. In addition, Admiral Canaris, who was head of the OKW\r\n    _Abwehr_, appeared at Dondorf nearly every two days and\r\n    conferred with Henlein.\r\n\r\n    “2. In the course of my official duties at Henlein’s\r\n    headquarters I became familiar with the composition and\r\n    activities of the Free Corps. Three groups were being formed\r\n    under Henlein’s direction: One in the Eisenstein area, Bavaria;\r\n    one in the Bayreuth area; one in the Dresden area; and possibly\r\n    a fourth group in Silesia. These groups were supposedly composed\r\n    of refugees from the Sudetenland who had crossed the border into\r\n    Germany, but they actually contained Germans with previous\r\n    service in the SA and NSKK (Nazi Motor Corps) as well. These\r\n    Germans formed the skeleton of the Free Corps. On paper the Free\r\n    Corps had a strength of 40,000 men. I do not know its actual\r\n    strength, but I believe it to be considerably smaller than the\r\n    paper figure. The Corps was armed with Manlicher-Schoenauer\r\n    rifles from Army depots in Austria. It was my understanding that\r\n    about 18,000 rifles were issued to men under Henlein’s command.\r\n    In addition, small numbers of machine guns[1], hand grenades,\r\n    and 2 captured antitank guns were placed at Henlein’s disposal.\r\n    Part of the equipment furnished to Henlein, mostly haversacks,\r\n    cooking utensils, and blankets, were supplied by the SA.\r\n\r\n    “3. In the days preceding the conclusion of the four-power pact\r\n    at Munich I heard of numerous occasions on which the Henlein\r\n    Free Corps was engaged in skirmishes with Czech patrols along\r\n    the border of the Sudetenland. These operations were under the\r\n    direction of Henlein, who went forward from his Headquarters\r\n    repeatedly in order to take direct command of his men.\r\n\r\n    “The facts stated above are true; this declaration is made by me\r\n    voluntarily and without compulsion; after reading over this\r\n    statement I have signed and executed the same.\r\n\r\n                                         “(Signed)  Gottlob Berger”\r\n                                                        (_3036-PS_)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] “(Rifles and machine guns were of doubtful serviceability due to\r\ninferior ammunition).”\r\n\r\nHenlein and his Free Corps were also acting in collaboration with the\r\nSD, (_Sicherheitsdienst_) Himmler’s intelligence organization. An\r\naffidavit executed by Alfred Helmut Naujocks, a member of the SD, reads\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “I, ALFRED HELMUT NAUJOCKS, being first duly sworn, depose and\r\n    state as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. In September 1938 I was working in Amt III of the SD. (The\r\n    department which was then called Amt III later became Amt VI).\r\n    In the course of my work I traveled between Berlin, Hof and\r\n    Munich.\r\n\r\n    “2. While in Hof, which is on the Czech border, I paid repeated\r\n    visits to the SD Service Department, that is, Intelligence\r\n    Office, which has been established there. This Service\r\n    Department had the task of collecting all political intelligence\r\n    emanating from the Czechoslovak border districts and passing it\r\n    on to Berlin. Continuous day and night teleprinter\r\n    communications had been established from Hof direct to Amt III\r\n    of the SD in Berlin. To the best of my recollection the head of\r\n    the Hof office was Daufeldt. The head of Amt III in Berlin at\r\n    this time was Jost and his assistant was Filbert.\r\n\r\n    “3. The bulk of the intelligence we collected came from Henlein\r\n    Free Corps, which had its headquarters in a castle at Dondorf,\r\n    outside Bayreuth; the distance between Hof and Bayreuth is not\r\n    very great, and we had daily access to all intelligence received\r\n    by the Free Corps. There was a continuous liaison maintained\r\n    with Czech territory by runners. Exploitation of this\r\n    Intelligence was carried out every day in Berlin and was placed\r\n    before Heydrich and Himmler.\r\n\r\n    “4. I remember that the Free Corps made continuous complaints\r\n    that they had not received sufficient supply of arms.\r\n    Negotiations by letter and teleprint message went on for a\r\n    number of days with Berlin until it became quite a nuisance.\r\n    After that arms were supplied from the army, but I believe it\r\n    was only a small quantity.\r\n\r\n    “5. Hof was the center for all intelligence collected by the SD\r\n    on the Czechoslovak question. The SD had agents all along the\r\n    border in every town. The names of these agents were reported to\r\n    Hof, and two motor cars toured the border every day to collect\r\n    the intelligence which had been unearthed. In addition, I\r\n    remember that two or three companies of the SS-Totenkopf units\r\n    were stationed in the neighborhood of Asch.\r\n\r\n    “The facts stated above are true: this declaration is made by me\r\n    voluntarily and without compulsion; after reading over this\r\n    statement I have signed and executed the same at Nurnberg,\r\n    Germany this 20th day of November 1945.\r\n\r\n                                 “(signed) Alfred Helmut Naujocks.”\r\n                                                        (_3029-PS_)\r\n\r\nOffensive operations along the Czechoslovak border were not confined to\r\nskirmishes carried out by the Free Corps. Two SS _Totenkopf_ battalions\r\nwere operating across the border in Czech territory near Asch. _Item 36_\r\nin the Schmundt file (_388-PS_), an OKW most secret order signed by Jodl\r\nand dated 28 September, states:\r\n\r\n    “Those SS-Totenkopf units now operating in the Asch Promontory\r\n    (I and II Bn of Oberbayern Regiment) will come under the C in C\r\n    Army only when they return to German Reich territory, or when\r\n    the Army crosses the German-Czech frontier.” (_388-PS, Item 36_)\r\n\r\nAccording to the 25 September entry in General Jodl’s diary these SS\r\nTotenkopf battalions were operating in this area on direct orders from\r\nHitler. (_1780-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs the time for X-day approached, the disposition of the Free Corps\r\nbecame a matter of dispute. On 26 September Himmler issued an order to\r\nthe Chief of Staff of the Sudeten German Free Corps directing that the\r\nFree Corps come under control of the Reichsfuehrer SS in the event of\r\nGerman invasion of Czechoslovakia (_388-PS, Item 37_). On 28 September\r\nKeitel directed that as soon as the German Army crosses the Czech border\r\nthe Free Corps will take orders from the OKH. In this most secret order\r\nof the OKW Keitel discloses that Henlein’s men are already operating in\r\nCzechoslovak territory:\r\n\r\n    “For the Henlein Free Corps and units subordinate to this the\r\n    principle remains valid, that they receive instructions direct\r\n    from the Fuehrer and that they carry out their operations only\r\n    in conjunction with the competent general staff corps. The\r\n    advance units of the Free Corps will have to report to the local\r\n    commander of the frontier guard immediately before crossing the\r\n    frontier.\r\n\r\n    “Those units remaining forward of the frontier should—in their\r\n    own interests—get into communication with the frontier guard as\r\n    often as possible.\r\n\r\n    “As soon as the army crosses the Czech border the Henlein Free\r\n    Corps will be subordinate to the OKH. Thus it will be expedient\r\n    to assign a sector to the Free Corps even now which can be\r\n    fitted into the scheme of army boundaries later.” (_388-PS, Item\r\n    34_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 September, when it became clear that the Munich settlement would\r\nresult in a peaceful occupation of the Sudetenland, Keitel ordered that\r\nthe Free Corps Henlein in its present composition be placed under\r\ncommand of Himmler:\r\n\r\n    “1. _Attachment of Henlein Free Corps_:\r\n\r\n    “The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces has just ordered that\r\n    the Henlein Free Corps in its present composition be placed\r\n    under command of Reichsfuehrer-SS and Chief of German Police.\r\n\r\n    “It is therefore at the immediate disposal of OKH as field unit\r\n    for the invasion, but is to be later drawn in like the rest of\r\n    the police forces for police duties in agreement with the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS.” (_388-PS, Item 38_)\r\n\r\nJ. _Occupation of the Sudetenland under the Terms of the Munich\r\nAgreement._\r\n\r\nUnder the threat of war by the Nazi conspirators, and with war in fact\r\nabout to be launched, the United Kingdom and France concluded a pact\r\nwith Germany and Italy at Munich on the night of 29 September 1938. This\r\ntreaty provided for the cession of the Sudetenland by Czechoslovakia to\r\nGermany. Czechoslovakia was required to acquiesce. (_TC-23_)\r\n\r\nOn 1 October 1938 German troops began the occupation of the Sudetenland.\r\n\r\nDuring the conclusion of the Munich Pact the _Wehrmacht_ had been fully\r\ndeployed for attack, awaiting only the word of Hitler to begin the\r\nassault. With the cession of the Sudetenland new orders were issued. On\r\n30 September Keitel promulgated Directive #1 on “Occupation of territory\r\nseparated from Czechoslovakia” (_388-PS, Item 39_). This directive\r\ncontained a timetable for the occupation of sectors of former Czech\r\nterritory between 1 and 10 October and specified the tasks of the German\r\narmed forces. The fourth and fifth paragraphs provided:\r\n\r\n    “2. The Armed Forces will have the following tasks:\r\n\r\n    “The present degree of mobilized preparedness is to be\r\n    maintained completely, for the present also in the West. Order\r\n    for the rescinding of measures taken is held over. “The entry is\r\n    to be planned in such a way that it can easily be converted into\r\n    operation ‘_Gruen_’.” (_388-PS, Item 39_)\r\n\r\nIt contained one further provision about the Henlein forces:\r\n\r\n    “Henlein Free Corps. All combat action on the part of the\r\n    Volunteer Corps must cease as from 1st October.” (_388-PS, Item\r\n    39_)\r\n\r\nThe Schmundt file contains a number of additional secret OKW directives\r\ngiving instructions for the occupation of the Sudetenland and showing\r\nthe scope of the preparations of the OKW. Directives specifying the\r\noccupational area of the army and the units under its command; arranging\r\nfor communications facilities, exchange facilities, supply, and\r\npropaganda; and giving instructions to the civil departments of the\r\ngovernment were issued over Keitel’s signature on 30 September (_388-PS,\r\nItems 40, 41, 42_). By 10 October von Brauchitsch was able to report to\r\nHitler that German troops had reached the demarcation line and that the\r\norder for the occupation of the Sudetenland had been fulfilled. The OKW\r\nrequested Hitler’s permission to rescind Case Green, to withdraw troops\r\nfrom the occupied area and to relieve the OKH of executive powers in the\r\nSudeten-German area as of 15 October. (_388-PS, Items 46, 47, 49_)\r\n\r\nOn 18 October, in a formal letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army,\r\nCol. Gen. von Brauchitsch, Hitler announced that the civil authorities\r\nwould take over responsibility for the Sudeten-German territory on 21\r\nOctober and that the OKH would be relieved of executive powers as of\r\nthat date (_388-PS, Item 51_). On the same date additional\r\ndemobilization of the forces in the Sudetenland was ordered by Hitler\r\nand Keitel. Three days later the OKW requested Hitler’s consent to the\r\nreversion of the RAD from the control of the armed forces. (_388-PS,\r\nItems 52, 53_)\r\n\r\nAs the German forces entered the Sudetenland Henlein’s _Sudetendeutsche\r\nPartei_ was merged with the NSDAP of Hitler. The two men who had fled to\r\nHitler’s protection in mid-September, Henlein and Karl Hermann Frank,\r\nwere appointed Gauleiter and Deputy Gauleiter, respectively, of the\r\n_Sudetengau_. In the parts of the Czechoslovak Republic that were still\r\nfree the _Sudetendeutsche Partei_ constituted itself as the\r\n_National-Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei in der\r\nTschechoslovakei_ (NSDAP in Czechoslovakia) under the direction of\r\nKundt, another of Henlein’s deputies. These events are set forth in the\r\nCzechoslovak official report. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe stage was now prepared for the next move of the Nazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nK. _Planning for the Conquest of the Remainder of Czechoslovakia._\r\n\r\nWith the occupation of the Sudetenland and the inclusion of the\r\nGerman-speaking Czechs within the Greater Reich it might have been\r\nexpected that the Nazi conspirators would be satisfied. Thus far in the\r\nNazi program of aggression the conspirators had used as a pretext for\r\ntheir conquests the union of the _Volksdeutsche_, the people of German\r\ndescent, with the Reich. Now, after Munich, substantially all the\r\n_Volksdeutsche_ in Czechoslovakia had been returned to German rule. On\r\n26 September, at the Sportspalast in Berlin, Hitler spoke these words:\r\n\r\n    “And now we are confronted with the last problem which must be\r\n    solved and which will be solved. It is the last territorial\r\n    claim which I have to make in Europe, but it is a claim from\r\n    which I will not swerve, and which I will satisfy, God willing.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I have little to explain. I am grateful to Mr. Chamberlain for\r\n    all his efforts, and I have assured him that the German people\r\n    want nothing but peace; but I have also told him that I cannot\r\n    go back beyond the limits of our patience.\r\n\r\n    “I assured him, moreover, and I repeat it here, that when this\r\n    problem is solved there will be no more territorial problems for\r\n    Germany in Europe. And I further assured him that from the\r\n    moment when Czechoslovakia solves its other problems, that is to\r\n    say when the Czechs have come to an arrangement with their other\r\n    minorities peacefully and without oppression, I will no longer\r\n    be interested in the Czech State. And that as far as I am\r\n    concerned I will guarantee. We don’t want any Czechs at all.”\r\n    (_2358-PS_)\r\n\r\nYet no more than two weeks later Hitler and Keitel were preparing\r\nestimates of the military forces required to break Czechoslovak\r\nresistance in Bohemia and Moravia. _Item 48_ of the Schmundt file is a\r\ntop secret telegram sent by Keitel to Hitler’s headquarters on 11\r\nOctober 1938 in answer to four questions which Hitler had propounded to\r\nthe OKW. These were the questions:\r\n\r\n    “Question 1: What reinforcements are necessary in the present\r\n    situation to break all Czech resistance in Bohemia and Moravia?\r\n\r\n    “Question 2: How much time is required for the regrouping or\r\n    moving up of new forces?\r\n\r\n    “Question 3: How much time will be required for the same purpose\r\n    if it is executed after the intended demobilization and return\r\n    measures?\r\n\r\n    “Question 4: How much time would be required to achieve the\r\n    state of readiness of October 1st?” (_388-PS, Item 48_)\r\n\r\nWhereupon, in the same telegram, Keitel reported to Hitler the\r\nconsidered answers of the OKH and the Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\nOn 21 October, the same day on which the administration of the\r\nSudetenland was handed over to the civilian authorities, a directive\r\noutlining plans for the conquest of the remainder of Czechoslovakia was\r\nsigned by Hitler and initialed by Keitel. In this Top Secret Order, of\r\nwhich 10 copies were made, the Nazi conspirators, only three weeks after\r\nthe winning of the Sudetenland, were already looking forward to new\r\nconquests:\r\n\r\n    “The future tasks for the Armed Forces and the preparations for\r\n    the conduct of war resulting from these tasks will be laid down\r\n    by me in a later Directive.\r\n\r\n    “Until this Directive comes into force the Armed Forces must be\r\n    prepared at all times for the following eventualities:\r\n\r\n    “1. The securing of the frontiers of Germany and the protection\r\n    against surprise air attacks.\r\n\r\n    “2. The liquidation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\n    “3. The occupation of the Memelland.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It must be possible to smash at any time the remainder of\r\n    Czechoslovakia if her policy should become hostile towards\r\n    Germany.\r\n\r\n    “The preparations to be made by the Armed Forces for this\r\n    contingency will be considerably smaller in extent than those\r\n    for ‘_Gruen_’; they must, however, guarantee a continuous and\r\n    considerably higher state of preparedness, since planned\r\n    mobilization measures have been dispensed with. The\r\n    organization, order of battle and state of readiness of the\r\n    units earmarked for that purpose are in peace-time to be so\r\n    arranged for a surprise assault that Czechoslovakia herself will\r\n    be deprived of all possibility of organized resistance. The\r\n    object is the swift occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the\r\n    cutting off of Slovakia. The preparations should be such, that\r\n    at the same time ‘_Grenzsicherung West_’ (the measures of\r\n    frontier defense in the West) can be carried out.\r\n\r\n    “The detailed mission of Army and Air Force is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_a. Army_\r\n\r\n    “The units stationed in the vicinity of Bohemia-Moravia and\r\n    several motorized divisions are to be earmarked for a surprise\r\n    type of attack. Their number will be determined by the forces\r\n    remaining in Czechoslovakia; a quick and decisive success must\r\n    be assured. The assembly and preparations for the attack must be\r\n    worked out. Forces not needed will be kept in readiness in such\r\n    a manner that they may be either committed in securing the\r\n    frontiers or sent after the attack army.\r\n\r\n    “_b. Air Force_\r\n\r\n    “The quick advance of the German Army is to be assured by an\r\n    early elimination of the Czech Air Force.\r\n\r\n    “For this purpose the commitment in a surprise attack from\r\n    peace-time bases has to be prepared. Whether for this purpose\r\n    still stronger forces may be required can only be determined\r\n    from the development of the military situation in\r\n    Czechoslovakia. At the same time a simultaneous assembly of the\r\n    remainder of the offensive forces against the West must be\r\n    prepared.” (_C-136_)\r\n\r\nThis order was signed by Hitler and authenticated by Keitel. It was\r\ndistributed to the OKH, to Goering’s Luftwaffe, and to Raeder at Navy\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, on 17 December 1938, Keitel issued an appendix to the\r\noriginal order stating that by command of the Fuehrer preparations for\r\nthe liquidation of Czechoslovakia are to continue. Distribution of this\r\nTop Secret order was the same as for the 21 October order. The order\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n    “2. _COROLLARY TO DIRECTIVE OF 21.10.38._\r\n\r\n    “Reference ‘Liquidation of the Rest of Czechoslovakia’ the\r\n    Fuehrer has given the following additional order:\r\n\r\n    “The preparations for this eventuality are to continue on the\r\n    assumption that no resistance worth mentioning is to be\r\n    expected.\r\n\r\n    “To the outside world too it must clearly appear that it is\r\n    merely an action of pacification and not a warlike undertaking.\r\n\r\n    “The action must therefore be carried out by the peace time\r\n    Armed Forces _only_, without reinforcements from mobilization.\r\n    The necessary readiness for action, especially the ensuring that\r\n    the most necessary supplies are brought up, must be effected by\r\n    adjustment within the units.\r\n\r\n    “Similarly the units of the Army detailed for the march must, as\r\n    a general rule, leave their stations only during the night prior\r\n    to the crossing of the frontier, and will not previously form up\r\n    systematically on the frontier. The transport necessary for\r\n    previous organization should be limited to the minimum and will\r\n    be camouflaged as much as possible. Necessary movements, if any,\r\n    of single units and particularly of motorized forces, to the\r\n    troop-training areas situated near the frontier, must have the\r\n    approval of the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “The Air Force should take action in accordance with the similar\r\n    general directives.\r\n\r\n    “For the same reasons the exercise of executive power by the\r\n    Supreme Command of the Army is laid down only for the newly\r\n    occupied territory and only for a short period.\r\n\r\n                                      “Chief of the Supreme Command\r\n                                             of the Armed Forces.\r\n                                                             “KEITEL”\r\n                                                               (_C-138_)\r\n\r\nThis particular copy of the order, an original carbon signed in ink by\r\nKeitel, was the one sent to the OKM, the German naval headquarters. It\r\nbears the initials of Fricke, head of the Operational Division of the\r\nNaval War Staff, of Schniewind, Chief of Staff of the Naval War Staff,\r\nand of Raeder.\r\n\r\nAs the _Wehrmacht_ moved forward with plans for what it clearly\r\nconsidered would be an easy victory, the Foreign Office played its part.\r\nIn a discussion of means of improving German-Czech relations with the\r\nCzechoslovak Foreign Minister, Chvalkovsky, in Berlin on 21 January\r\n1939, Ribbentrop urged upon the Czech government a “quick reduction” in\r\nthe size of the Czech army. The captured German Foreign Office notes of\r\nthis discussion bear the following footnote, in Ribbentrop’s\r\nhandwriting:\r\n\r\n    “I mentioned to Chvalkovsky especially that a quick reduction in\r\n    the Czech army would be decisive in our judgment.” (_2795-PS_)\r\n\r\nL. _Extension of Fifth Column Activity_\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Austria and the Sudetenland, the Nazi conspirators did\r\nnot intend to rely on the _Wehrmacht_ alone to accomplish their\r\ncalculated objective of “liquidating” Czechoslovakia. With the German\r\nminority separated from Czechoslovakia, they could no longer use the\r\ncry, “home to the Reich.” One sizeable minority, the Slovaks, remained\r\nwithin the Czechoslovak State. The Czechoslovak Government had made\r\nevery effort to conciliate Slovak extremists in the months after the\r\ncession of the Sudetenland. Autonomy had been granted to Slovakia, with\r\nan autonomous cabinet and parliament at Bratislava. Nonetheless, despite\r\nthese concessions, it was in Slovakia that the Nazi conspirators found\r\nmen ready to take their money and do their bidding. The following\r\npicture of Nazi operations in Slovakia is based on the Czechoslovak\r\nofficial report. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nNazi propaganda and “research” groups had long been interested in\r\nmaintaining close connections with the Slovak autonomist opposition.\r\nWhen Bela Tuka, who later became Prime Minister of the puppet state of\r\nSlovakia, was tried for espionage and treason in 1929, the evidence\r\nestablished that he had already established connections with Nazi groups\r\nwithin Germany. Prior to 1938 Nazi aides were in close contact with\r\nSlovak traitors living in exile and were attempting to establish more\r\nprofitable contacts in the semi-fascist Slovak Catholic Peoples Party of\r\nMonsignor Andrew Hlinka. Out of sympathy with the predominantly\r\nanti-clerical government in Prague, some Catholic elements in Slovakia\r\nproved willing to cooperate with the Nazis. In February and July 1938\r\nthe leaders of the Henlein movement conferred with top men of Father\r\nHlinka’s party and agreed to furnish one another with mutual assistance\r\nin pressing their respective claims to autonomy. This understanding\r\nproved useful in the September agitation when, at the proper moment, the\r\nForeign Office in Berlin wired the Henlein leader, Kundt, in Prague to\r\ntell the Slovaks to start their demands for autonomy. (See _2858-PS_.)\r\n\r\nBy this time, mid-summer 1938, the Nazis were in direct contact with\r\nfigures in the Slovak autonomist movement and had paid agents among the\r\nhigher staff of Father Hlinka’s party. These agents undertook to render\r\nimpossible any understanding between the Slovak autonomists and the\r\nSlovak parties in the government at Prague. Franz Karmasin, later to\r\nbecome _Volksgruppenfuehrer_, had been appointed Nazi leader in Slovakia\r\nand professed to be serving the cause of Slovak autonomy while on the\r\nNazi pay roll. On 22 November the Nazis indiscreetly wired Karmasin to\r\ncollect his money at the German Legation in person. The telegram, sent\r\nfrom the German Legation at Prague to Bratislava (Pressburg), reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Delegate Kundt asks to notify State Secretary Karmasin that he\r\n    would appreciate it if he could personally draw the sum which is\r\n    being kept for him at the treasury of the embassy.\r\n\r\n                                              “HENCKE”  (_2859-PS_)\r\n\r\nKarmasin proved to be extremely useful to the Nazi cause. A captured\r\nmemorandum of the German Foreign Office, dated Berlin, 29 November\r\n1939—eight months after the conquest of Czechoslovakia—throws a\r\nrevealing light both on Karmasin and on the German Foreign Office:\r\n\r\n    “_On the question of payments to KARMASIN_\r\n\r\n    “Karmasin receives 30,000 Marks for the VDA (Peoples’ League for\r\n    Germans Abroad) until 1 April 1940; from then on 15,000 Marks\r\n    monthly.\r\n\r\n    “Furthermore, the Central Office for Racial Germans\r\n    (_Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle_) has deposited 300,000 Marks for\r\n    Karmasin with the German Mission in Bratislava (Pressburg) on\r\n    which he could fall back in an emergency.\r\n\r\n    “Furthermore, Karmasin has received money from Reich Minister\r\n    Seyss-Inquart; for the present it has been impossible to\r\n    determine what amounts had been involved, and whether the\r\n    payments will continue.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore it appears that Karmasin has been provided with\r\n    sufficient money; thus one could await whether he would put up\r\n    new demands himself.\r\n\r\n    “Herewith presented to the Reich Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\n                                       “/s/  WOERMANN”  (_2794-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis document shows the complicity of the German Foreign Office in the\r\nsubsidization of illegal organizations abroad. More important, it shows\r\nthat the Germans still considered it necessary to supply their\r\nunder-cover representatives in Pressburg with substantial funds even\r\nafter the declaration of the so-called independent State of Slovakia.\r\n\r\nSome time in the winter of 1938-1939 Goering conferred with Durcansky\r\nand Mach, two leaders in the Slovak extremist group, who were\r\naccompanied by Karmasin. The Slovaks told Goering of their desire for\r\nwhat they called “independence,” with strong political, economic, and\r\nmilitary ties to Germany. They promised that the Jewish problem would be\r\nsolved as it had been in Germany and that the Communist Party would be\r\nprohibited. The notes of the meeting report that Goering considered that\r\nthe Slovak efforts towards independence were to be supported, although\r\nhis motives were scarcely altruistic. The undated minutes of this\r\nconversation between Goering and Durcansky, captured among the files of\r\nthe German Foreign Office, are jotted down in somewhat telegraphic\r\nstyle:\r\n\r\n    “To begin with DURKANSKY (Deputy Prime Minister) reads out\r\n    declaration. Contents: Friendship for the Fuehrer; gratitude,\r\n    that through the Fuehrer autonomy has become possible for the\r\n    SLOVAKS. The SLOVAKS _never_ want to belong to HUNGARY. The\r\n    SLOVAKS want _full independence_ with strongest political,\r\n    economic and military ties to Germany. BRATISLAVA to be capital.\r\n    The execution of the plan only possible if the army and police\r\n    are SLOVAK.\r\n\r\n    “An independent SLOVAKIA to be proclaimed at the meeting of the\r\n    first SLOVAK Diet.

The area of the plebiscite to be up to the MARCH, where\r\n    a large SLOVAK population lives.\r\n\r\n    “The _Jewish problem_ will be solved similarly to that in\r\n    Germany. The Communist party to be prohibited.\r\n\r\n    “The _Germans_ in SLOVAKIA do not want to belong to Hungary but\r\n    wish to stay in SLOVAKIA.\r\n\r\n    “The _German influence_ with the SLOVAK Government considerable;\r\n    the appointment of a German Minister (member of the cabinet) has\r\n    been promised.\r\n\r\n    “At present negotiations with HUNGARY are being conducted by the\r\n    SLOVAKS. The CZECHS are more yielding towards the Hungarians\r\n    than the SLOVAKS.\r\n\r\n    “The Fieldmarshall considers; that the SLOVAK negotiations\r\n    towards independence are to be supported in a suitable manner.\r\n    Czechoslovakia without Slovakia is still more at our mercy.\r\n\r\n    “Air bases in Slovakia are of great importance for the German\r\n    Air Force for use against the East.” (_2801-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn mid-February 1939 a Slovak delegation journeyed to Berlin. It\r\nconsisted of Tuca, one of the Slovaks with whom the Germans had been in\r\ncontact, and Karmasin, the paid representative of the Nazi conspirators\r\nin Slovakia. They conferred with Hitler and Ribbentrop in the Reichs\r\nChancellery in Berlin on Sunday, 12 February 1939. The captured German\r\nForeign Office minutes of that meeting read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “After a brief welcome Tuca thanks the Fuehrer for granting this\r\n    meeting. He addresses the Fuehrer with ‘My Fuehrer’ and he\r\n    voices the opinion that he, though only a modest man himself,\r\n    might well claim to speak for the Slovak nation. The Czech\r\n    courts and prison gave him the right to make such a statement.\r\n    He states that the Fuehrer had not only opened the Slovak\r\n    question but that he had been also the first one to acknowledge\r\n    the dignity of the Slovak nation. The Slovakian people will\r\n    gladly fight under the leadership of the Fuehrer for the\r\n    maintenance of European civilization. Obviously future\r\n    association with the Czechs had become an impossibility for the\r\n    Slovaks from a moral as well as economic point of view.”\r\n    (_2790-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that Tuca addressed Hitler as “My Fuehrer”. During this\r\nmeeting the Nazi conspirators apparently were successful in planting the\r\nidea of insurrection with the Slovak delegation. The final sentence of\r\nthis document, spoken by Tuca, is conclusive:\r\n\r\n    “I entrust the fate of my people to your care.” (_2790-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from these documents that in mid-February 1939 the Nazis\r\nhad a well-disciplined group of Slovaks at their service, many of them\r\ndrawn from the ranks of Father Hlinka’s party. Flattered by the personal\r\nattention of such men as Hitler and Ribbentrop, and subsidized by German\r\nrepresentatives, these Slovaks proved willing tools in the hands of the\r\nNazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Slovaks, the Nazi conspirators made use of the few\r\nGermans still remaining within the mutilated Czech republic. Kundt,\r\nHenlein’s deputy who had been appointed leader of this German minority,\r\ncreated as many artificial “focal points of German culture” as possible.\r\nGermans from the districts handed over to Germany were ordered from\r\nBerlin to continue their studies at the German University in Prague and\r\nto make it a center of aggressive Naziism. With the assistance of German\r\ncivil servants, a deliberate campaign of Nazi infiltration into Czech\r\npublic and private institutions was carried out, and the Henleinists\r\ngave full cooperation with Gestapo agents from the Reich who appeared on\r\nCzech soil. The Nazi “political activity” was designed to undermine and\r\nto weaken Czech resistance to the commands from Germany. In the face of\r\ncontinued threats and duress on both diplomatic and propaganda levels,\r\nthe Czech government was unable to take adequate measures against these\r\ntrespasses on its sovereignty. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn early March, with the date for the invasion of Czechoslovakia already\r\nclose at hand, fifth column activity moved into its final phase. In\r\nBohemia and Moravia the FS, Henlein’s equivalent of the SS, were in\r\ntouch with the Nazi conspirators in the Reich and laid the groundwork\r\nfor the events of 14 and 15 March. An article by SS-Gruppenfuehrer Karl\r\nHermann Frank, published in _Boehmen und Maehren_, the official\r\nperiodical of the Reichs Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, March 1941,\r\npage 79, reveals with considerable frankness the functions which the FS\r\nand SS served and the pride the Nazi conspirators took in the activities\r\nof these organizations:\r\n\r\n                       “The SS on March 15, 1939\r\n\r\n    “A modern people and a modern state are today unthinkable\r\n    without political troops. To these are allotted the special task\r\n    of being the advance guard of the political will and the\r\n    guarantor of its unity. This is especially true of the German\r\n    folk-groups, which have their home in some other people’s state.\r\n    Accordingly the Sudeten German Party had formerly also organized\r\n    its political troop, the Voluntary Vigilantes (_Freiwilliger\r\n    Selbstschutz_), called ‘FS’ for short. This troop was trained\r\n    essentially in accordance with the principles of the SS, so far\r\n    as these could be used in this region at that time. The troop\r\n    was likewise assigned here the special task of protecting the\r\n    homeland, actively, if necessary. It stood up well in its first\r\n    test in this connection, wherever in the fall crisis of 1938 it\r\n    had to assume the protection of the homeland, arms in hand.\r\n\r\n    “After the annexation of the Sudeten Gau, the tasks of the FS\r\n    were transferred essentially to the German student organizations\r\n    as compact troop formations in Prague and Brunn, aside from the\r\n    isolated German communities which remained in the second\r\n    republic. This was also natural because many active students\r\n    from the Sudeten Gau were already members of the FS. The student\r\n    organizations then had to endure this test, in common with other\r\n    Germans, during the crisis of March 1939 * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the early morning hours of March 15, after the announcement\r\n    of the planned entry of German troops in various localities,\r\n    German men had to act in some localities in order to assure a\r\n    quiet course of events, either by assumption of the police\r\n    authority, as for instance in Brunn, or by corresponding\r\n    instruction of the police president, etc. In some Czech offices,\r\n    men had likewise, in the early hours of the morning, begun to\r\n    burn valuable archives and the material of political files. It\r\n    was also necessary to take measures here in order to prevent\r\n    foolish destruction * * *. How significant the many-sided and\r\n    comprehensive measures were considered by the competent German\r\n    agencies, follows from the fact that many of the men either on\r\n    March 15 itself or on the following days were admitted into the\r\n    SS with fitting acknowledgment, in part even through the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS himself or through SS Group Leader Heydrich.\r\n    The activities and deeds of these men were thereby designated as\r\n    accomplished in the interest of the SS.\r\n\r\n    “Immediately after the corresponding divisions of the SS had\r\n    marched in with the first columns of the German Army and had\r\n    assumed responsibility in the appropriate sectors, the men here\r\n    placed themselves at once at their further disposition and\r\n    became valuable auxiliaries and collaborators. * * *”\r\n    (_2826-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe background of the German intrigue in Slovakia is outlined in two\r\nBritish diplomatic despatches (_D-571_, _D-572_) and excerpts from\r\ndespatches sent by M. Coulondre, the French Ambassador in Berlin to the\r\nFrench Foreign Office between 13 and 18 March 1939, and published in the\r\nFrench Yellow Book. (_2943-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn Slovakia the long-anticipated crisis came on 10 March. On that day\r\nthe Czechoslovakian government dismissed those members of the Slovak\r\nCabinet who refused to continue negotiations with Prague, among them\r\nPrime Minister Tiso and Durcansky. Within 24 hours the Nazis seized upon\r\nthis act of the Czech government as an excuse for intervention. On the\r\nfollowing day, 11 March, a strange scene was enacted in Bratislava, the\r\nSlovak capital. It is related in the report of the British Minister in\r\nPrague to the British government:\r\n\r\n    “Herr Buerckel, Herr Seyss-Inquart and five German generals came\r\n    at about 10 P. M. on the evening of Saturday, the 11th March,\r\n    into a Cabinet meeting in progress at Bratislava, and told the\r\n    Slovak Government that they should proclaim the independence of\r\n    Slovakia.

Sidor (the Prime Minister) showed hesitation,\r\n    Herr Buerckel took him on one side and explained that Herr\r\n    Hitler had decided to settle the question of Czecho-Slovakia\r\n    definitely. Slovakia ought, therefore, to proclaim her\r\n    independence because Herr Hitler would otherwise disinterest\r\n    himself in her fate. M. Sidor thanked Herr Buerckel for this\r\n    information, but said that he must discuss the situation with\r\n    the Government at Prague.” (_D-571_)\r\n\r\nEvents were now moving rapidly. Durcansky, one of the dismissed\r\nministers, escaped with Nazi assistance to Vienna, where the facilities\r\nof the German broadcasting station were placed at his disposal. Arms and\r\nammunition were brought from German Offices in Engerau, across the\r\nDanube, into Slovakia where they were used by the FS and the Hlinka\r\nGuard to create incidents and disorder of the type required by the Nazis\r\nas an excuse for military action. The situation at Engerau is described\r\nin an affidavit of Alfred Helmut Naujocks:\r\n\r\n    “I, ALFRED HELMUT NAUJOCKS, being first duly sworn, depose and\r\n    state as follows—\r\n\r\n    “1. From 1934 to 1941 I was a member of the SD. In the winter of\r\n    1939 I was stationed in Berlin, working in Amt VI, Chief Sector\r\n    South East. Early in March, four or five days before Slovakia\r\n    declared its independence, Heydrich, who was chief of the SD,\r\n    ordered me to report to Nebe, the chief of the Reich Criminal\r\n    Police. Nebe had been told by Heydrich to accelerate the\r\n    production of explosives which his department was manufacturing\r\n    for the use of certain Slovak groups. These explosives were\r\n    small tins weighing approximately 500 grams.\r\n\r\n    “2. As soon as forty or fifty of these explosives had been\r\n    finished, I carried them by automobile to a small village called\r\n    Engerau, just across the border from Pressburg in Slovakia. The\r\n    Security Police had a Service Department in this village for the\r\n    handling of SD activities. I turned over the explosives to this\r\n    office and found there a group of Slovaks, including Karmasin,\r\n    Mach, Tuka and Durcansky. In fact, three of these people then\r\n    present later became ministers in the new Slovak government. I\r\n    was informed that the explosives were to be turned over to the\r\n    Hlinka Guards across the border in Slovakia and were to be used\r\n    in incidents designed to create the proper atmosphere for a\r\n    revolution.\r\n\r\n    “3. I stayed in Engerau for a day and a half and then returned\r\n    to Berlin.\r\n\r\n    “4. One or two weeks later I met in Berlin the same Slovak\r\n    delegation, including Mach, Tuka, Durcansky and Karmasin, which\r\n    I had seen in Engerau. They had flown to Berlin for a conference\r\n    with Goering. Heydrich asked me to look after them and to report\r\n    to him what developed during the conference with Goering. I\r\n    reported this conference in detail to Heydrich. It dealt\r\n    principally with the organization of the new Slovak state. My\r\n    principal recollection of the conference is that the Slovaks\r\n    hardly got a word in because Goering was talking all the time.\r\n\r\n    “The facts stated above are true; this declaration is made by me\r\n    voluntarily and without compulsion; after reading over the\r\n    statement I have signed and executed the same at NURNBERG,\r\n    Germany this 20th day of November 1945.\r\n\r\n                                     “(Signed)  Alfred Helmut Naujocks\r\n                                          “ALFRED HELMUT NAUJOCKS”\r\n                                                             (_3030-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt this time the German press and radio launched a violent campaign\r\nagainst the Czechoslovak government. And, significantly, an invitation\r\nfrom Berlin was delivered in Bratislava. Tiso, the dismissed prime\r\nminister, was summoned by Hitler to an audience in the German capital. A\r\nplane was awaiting him in Vienna. (_998-PS_; _3061-PS_; _2943-PS_)\r\n\r\nM. _Occupation of Czechoslovakia Under Threat of Military Force._\r\n\r\nAt this point, in the second week of March 1939, preparations for what\r\nthe Nazi leaders liked to call the “liquidation” of Czechoslovakia were\r\nprogressing with a gratifying smoothness. The military, diplomatic, and\r\npropaganda machinery of the Nazi conspirators was moving in close\r\ncoordination. As during Case Green of the preceding summer, the Nazi\r\nconspirators had invited Hungary to participate in the attack. It\r\nappears from a letter Admiral Horthy, the Hungarian Regent, wrote to\r\nHitler on 13 March 1939, which was captured in the German Foreign Office\r\nfiles, that Horthy was flattered by the invitation:\r\n\r\n    “Your Excellency,\r\n\r\n        “My sincere thanks.\r\n\r\n    “I can hardly tell you how happy I am because this Head Water\r\n    Region—I dislike using big words—is of vital importance to the\r\n    life of Hungary.\r\n\r\n    “In spite of the fact that our recruits have only been serving\r\n    for 5 weeks we are going into this affair with eager enthusiasm.\r\n    The dispositions have already been made. On Thursday, the 16th\r\n    of this month, a frontier incident will take place which will be\r\n    followed by the big blow on Saturday.\r\n\r\n    “I shall never forget this proof of friendship and your\r\n    Excellency may rely on my unshakeable gratitude at all times.\r\n\r\n                         “Your devoted friend.\r\n                                            “(Signed)  HORTHY”\r\n\r\n    “Budapest. 13.3.1939.”  (_2816-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrom this letter it may be inferred that the Nazi conspirators had\r\nalready informed the Hungarian government of their plans for military\r\naction against Czechoslovakia. As it turned out, the timetable was\r\nadvanced somewhat.\r\n\r\nOn the diplomatic level Ribbentrop was active. On 13 March, the same day\r\non which Horthy wrote his letter, Ribbentrop sent a cautionary telegram\r\nto the German minister in Prague, outlining the course of conduct he\r\nshould pursue during the coming diplomatic pressure:\r\n\r\n                                         “_Telegram in secret code_\r\n\r\n    “With reference to telephone instructions given by Kordt today.\r\n\r\n    “In case you should get any written communication from President\r\n    HACHA, please do not make any written or verbal comments or take\r\n    any other action on them but pass them on here by cipher\r\n    telegram. Moreover, I must ask you and the other members of the\r\n    Embassy to make a point of not being available if the Czech\r\n    government wants to communicate with you during the next few\r\n    days.\r\n\r\n                               “(Signed)  RIBBENTROP”.  (_2815-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of 13 March, Monsignor Tiso, accompanied by Durcansky\r\nand by Karmasin, the local Nazi leader, arrived in Berlin in response to\r\nthe summons from Hitler. Late that afternoon Tiso was received by Hitler\r\nin his study in the Reichs Chancellery and was presented with an\r\nultimatum. Two alternatives were given him: either to declare the\r\nindependence of Slovakia or to be left, without German assistance, to\r\nthe mercies of Poland and Hungary. This decision, Hitler said, was not a\r\nquestion of days, but of hours. The captured German Foreign Office\r\nminutes of this meeting between Hitler and Tiso on 13 March show that in\r\nthe inducements Hitler held out to the Slovaks Hitler displayed his\r\ncustomary disregard for truth:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Now he [Hitler] had permitted Minister Tiso to come here\r\n    in order to make this question clear in a very short time.\r\n    Germany had no interests east of the Carpathian mountains. It\r\n    was indifferent to him what happened there. The question was\r\n    whether Slovakia wished to conduct her own affairs or not. He\r\n    did not wish for anything from Slovakia. He would not pledge his\r\n    people or even a single soldier to something which was not in\r\n    any way desired by the Slovak people. He would like to secure\r\n    final confirmation as to what Slovakia really wished. He did not\r\n    wish that reproaches should come from Hungary that he was\r\n    preserving something which did not wish to be preserved at all.\r\n    He took a liberal view of unrest and demonstration in general,\r\n    but in this connection, unrest was only an outward indication of\r\n    interior instability. He would not tolerate it, and he had for\r\n    that reason permitted Tiso to come in order to hear his\r\n    decision. It was not a question of days, but of hours. He had\r\n    stated at that time that if Slovakia wished to make herself\r\n    independent he would support this endeavor and even guarantee\r\n    it. He would stand by his word so long as Slovakia would make it\r\n    clear that she wished for independence. If she hesitated or did\r\n    not wish to dissolve the connection with Prague, he would leave\r\n    the destiny of Slovakia to the mercy of events, for which he was\r\n    no longer responsible. In that case he would only intercede for\r\n    German interests and those did not lie east of the Carpathians.\r\n    Germany had nothing to do with Slovakia. She had never belonged\r\n    to Germany.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer asked the Reich Foreign Minister if he had any\r\n    remarks to add. The Reich Foreign Minister also emphasized for\r\n    his part the conception that in this case a decision was a\r\n    question of hours not of days. He showed the Fuehrer a message\r\n    he had just received which reported Hungarian troop movements on\r\n    the Slovak frontiers. The Fuehrer read this report, mentioned it\r\n    to Tiso, and expressed the hope that Slovakia would soon decide\r\n    clearly for herself.” (_2802-PS_)\r\n\r\nThose present at this meeting included Ribbentrop, Keitel, State\r\nSecretary Dietrich, State Secretary Keppler, and Minister of State\r\nMeissner.\r\n\r\nWhile in Berlin, the Slovaks also conferred separately with Ribbentrop\r\nand with other high Nazi officials. Ribbentrop solicitously handed Tiso\r\na copy, already drafted in Slovak, of the law proclaiming the\r\nindependence of Slovakia. On the night of 13 March a German plane was\r\nplaced at Tiso’s disposal to carry him home. On 14 March, pursuant to\r\nthe wishes of the Nazi conspirators, the Diet of Bratislava proclaimed\r\nthe independence of Slovakia.\r\n\r\nWith Slovak extremists, acting at Nazi bidding, in open revolt against\r\nthe Czechoslovak government, the Nazi leaders were now in a position to\r\nmove against Prague. On the evening of 14 March, at the suggestion of\r\nthe German Legation in Prague M. Hacha, the president of the\r\nCzechoslovak republic, and M. Chvalkovsky, his foreign minister, arrived\r\nin Berlin. The atmosphere in which they found themselves was hostile.\r\nSince the preceding weekend the Nazi press had accused the Czechs of\r\nusing violence against the Slovaks and especially against members of the\r\nGerman minority and citizens of the Reich. Both press and radio\r\nproclaimed that the lives of Germans were in danger, that the situation\r\nwas intolerable and that it was necessary to smother as quickly as\r\npossible the focus of trouble which Prague had become in the heart of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight on the 15 March, at 1:15 in the morning, Hacha and\r\nChvalkovsky were ushered into the Reichs Chancellery. They found there\r\nHitler, von Ribbentrop, Goering, Keitel, and other high Nazi officials.\r\nThe captured German Foreign Office account of this meeting furnishes a\r\nrevealing picture of Nazi behaviour and tactics. It must be remembered\r\nthat this account of the conference of the night of March 14-15 comes\r\nfrom German sources, and must be read as an account biased by its\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nHacha opened the conference. He was conciliatory, even humble. He\r\nthanked Hitler for receiving him and said he knew that the fate of\r\nCzechoslovakia rested in the Fuehrer’s hands. Hitler replied that he\r\nregretted that he had been forced to ask Hacha to come to Berlin,\r\nparticularly because of the great age of the President. (Hacha was then\r\nin his seventies.) But this journey, Hitler told the President, could be\r\nof great advantage to his country, because “it was only a matter of\r\nhours until Germany would intervene.” The conference proceeded as\r\nfollows, with Hitler speaking:\r\n\r\n    “Slovakia was a matter of indifference to him. If Slovakia had\r\n    kept closer to Germany, it would have been an obligation to\r\n    Germany, but he was glad that he did not have this obligation\r\n    now. He had no interests whatsoever in the territory east of the\r\n    Lower Carpathian Mts. Last autumn he had not wanted to draw the\r\n    final consequences because he had believed that it was possible\r\n    to live together. But even at that time, and also later in his\r\n    conversations with Chvalkovsky, he made it clear that he would\r\n    ruthlessly smash this state if Benes’ tendencies were not\r\n    completely revised. Chvalkovsky understood this and asked the\r\n    Fuehrer to have patience. The Fuehrer saw this point of view,\r\n    but the months went by without any change. The new regime did\r\n    not succeed in eliminating the old one psychologically. He\r\n    observed this from the press, mouth to mouth propaganda,\r\n    dismissals of Germans and many other things, which, to him, were\r\n    a symbol of the whole situation. At first he had not understood\r\n    this but when it became clear to him he drew his conclusions\r\n    because, had the development continued in this way, the\r\n    relations with Czechoslovakia would in a few years have become\r\n    the same as six months ago. Why did Czechoslovakia not\r\n    immediately reduce its army to a reasonable size? Such an army\r\n    was a tremendous burden for such a state because it only makes\r\n    sense if it supports the foreign political mission of the State.\r\n    Since Czechoslovakia no longer has a foreign political mission,\r\n    such an army is meaningless. He enumerates several examples\r\n    which proved to him that the spirit in the army had not changed.\r\n    This symptom convinced him that the army would be a severe\r\n    political burden in the future. Added to this were the\r\n    inevitable development of economic necessities and, further, the\r\n    protests from national groups which could no longer endure life\r\n    as it was.\r\n\r\n    “Last Sunday, therefore, for me the die was cast. I summoned the\r\n    Hungarian envoy and notified him that I was withdrawing my\r\n    [restraining] hands from that country. We were now confronted\r\n    with this fact. He had given the order to the German troops to\r\n    march into Czechoslovakia and to incorporate Czechoslovakia into\r\n    the German Reich. He wanted to give Czechoslovakia fullest\r\n    autonomy and a life of her own to a larger extent than she ever\r\n    had enjoyed during Austrian rule. Germany’s attitude towards\r\n    Czechoslovakia will be determined tomorrow and the day after\r\n    tomorrow and depends on the attitude of the Czechoslovakian\r\n    people and the Czechoslovakian military towards the German\r\n    troops. He no longer trusts the government. He believes in the\r\n    honesty and straight forwardness of Hacha and Chvalkovsky but\r\n    doubts that the government will be able to assert itself in the\r\n    entire nation. The German Army had already started out today,\r\n    and at one barracks where resistance was offered, it was\r\n    ruthlessly broken; another barracks had given in at the\r\n    deployment of heavy artillery.\r\n\r\n    “At 6 o’clock in the morning the German army would invade\r\n    Czechoslovakia from all sides and the German air force would\r\n    occupy the Czech airfields. There existed two possibilities. The\r\n    first one would be that the invasion of the German troops would\r\n    lead to a battle. In this case the resistance will be broken by\r\n    all means with physical force. The other possibility is that the\r\n    invasion of the German troops occurs in bearable form. In that\r\n    case it would be easy for the Fuehrer to give Czechoslovakia at\r\n    the new organization of Czech life a generous life of her own,\r\n    autonomy and a certain national liberty.\r\n\r\n    “We witnessed at the moment a great historical turning-point. He\r\n    would not like to torture and de-nationalize the Czechs. He also\r\n    did not do all that because of hatred but in order to protect\r\n    Germany. If Czechoslovakia in the fall of last year would not\r\n    have yielded, the Czech people would have been exterminated.\r\n    Nobody could have prevented him from doing that. It was his will\r\n    that the Czech people should live a full national life and he\r\n    believed firmly that a way could be found which would make\r\n    far-reaching concessions to the Czech desires. If fighting would\r\n    break out tomorrow, the pressure would result in\r\n    counter-pressure. One would annihilate one another and it would\r\n    then not be possible any more for him to give the promised\r\n    alleviations. Within two days the Czech army would not exist any\r\n    more. Of course, Germans would also be killed and this would\r\n    result in a hatred which would force him because of his instinct\r\n    of self-preservation not to grant autonomy any more. The world\r\n    would not move a muscle. He felt pity for the Czech people when\r\n    he read the foreign press. It gave him the impression expressed\r\n    in a German proverb: ‘The Moor has done his duty, the Moor may\r\n    go.’\r\n\r\n    “That was the state of affairs. There were two courses open to\r\n    Germany, a harder one which did not want any concessions and\r\n    wished in memory of the past that Czechoslovakia would be\r\n    conquered with blood, and another one, the attitude of which\r\n    corresponded with his proposals stated above.\r\n\r\n    “That was the reason why he had asked Hacha to come here. This\r\n    invitation was the last good deed which he could offer to the\r\n    Czech people. If it would come to a fight, the bloodshed would\r\n    also force us to hate. But the visit of Hacha could perhaps\r\n    prevent the extreme. Perhaps it would contribute to finding a\r\n    form of construction which would be much more far-reaching for\r\n    Czechoslovakia than she could ever have hoped for in old\r\n    Austria. His aim was only to create the necessary security for\r\n    the German people.\r\n\r\n    “The hours went past. At 6 o’clock the troops would march in. He\r\n    was almost ashamed to say that there was one German division to\r\n    each Czech battalion. The military action was no small one, but\r\n    planned with all generosity. He would advise him now to retire\r\n    with Chvalkovsky in order to discuss what should be done.”\r\n    (_2798-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn reply to this long harangue, Hacha, according to the German minutes,\r\nsaid that he agreed that resistance would be useless. He expressed doubt\r\nthat he would be able to issue the necessary orders to the Czech Army in\r\nthe four hours left to him before the German Army crossed the Czech\r\nborder. He asked if the object of the invasion was to disarm the Czech\r\nArmy. If so, that might be arranged. Hitler replied that his decision\r\nwas final, that it was well known what a decision of the Fuehrer meant.\r\nHe turned to the circle of Nazi conspirators surrounding him, which\r\nincluded Goering, Ribbentrop, and Keitel, for their support. The only\r\npossibility of disarming the Czech Army, Hitler said, was by the\r\nintervention of the German Army. At this point Hacha and Chvalkovsky\r\nretired from the room. (_2798-PS_)\r\n\r\nA dispatch from the British Ambassador, Sir Neville Henderson, published\r\nin the British Blue Book, describes a conversation with Goering in which\r\nthe events of this early morning meeting are set forth (_2861-PS_).\r\nDispatch No. 77 in the French Yellow Book from M. Coulondre, the French\r\nAmbassador, gives another well-informed version of this same midnight\r\nmeeting (_2943-PS_). The following account of the remainder of this\r\nmeeting is drawn from these two sources, as well as from the captured\r\nGerman minutes (_2787-PS_). (Cf. also _3061-PS_.)\r\n\r\nWhen President Hacha left the conference room in the Reichs Chancellery,\r\nhe was in such a state of exhaustion that he needed medical attention\r\nfrom a physician who was on hand for that purpose. It appears that he\r\nwas given an injection to sustain him during the ordeal. When the two\r\nCzechs returned to the room the Nazi conspirators again told them of the\r\npower and invincibility of the _Wehrmacht_. They reminded him that in\r\nthree hours, at 6 in the morning, the German Army would cross the\r\nborder. Goering boasted of what the German _Wehrmacht_ would do if Czech\r\nforces resisted the invading Germans. If German lives were lost, Goering\r\nsaid, his Luftwaffe would blast half Prague into ruins in two hours. And\r\nthat, Goering said, would be only the beginning. Under this threat of\r\nimminent and merciless attack by land and air, the President of\r\nCzechoslovakia at 4:30 in the morning signed the document with which the\r\nNazi conspirators confronted him. This Declaration of 15 March 1939\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “the President of the Czechoslovak State * * * entrusts with\r\n    entire confidence the destiny of the Czech people and the Czech\r\n    country to the hands of the Fuehrer of the German Reich.”\r\n    (_TC-49_)\r\n\r\nWhile the Nazi officials were threatening and intimidating the\r\nrepresentatives of the Czech government, the _Wehrmacht_ had in some\r\nareas already crossed the Czech border. The Czech industrial centres of\r\nMaehrisch-Ostrau and Witkowitz, close to the Silesian and Polish\r\nborders, were occupied by German troops and SS units during the early\r\nevening of 14 March. An article in the German military magazine, the\r\n_Wehrmacht_, of 29 March 1939 describes the movement of German troops\r\nduring the occupation:\r\n\r\n    “From Silesia, Saxony and Northern Bavaria and the Ostmark,\r\n    seven Army Corps moved on the morning of March 15 past the\r\n    former Czech border. On the evening of March 14 parts of the\r\n    VIII Army Corps and the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, under the\r\n    command of the Commanding General of the VIII Army Corps, had\r\n    already occupied the industrial centers of Witkowitz and\r\n    Maehrisch Ostrau.\r\n\r\n    “The troops of Army Group 3 under the command of General of\r\n    Infantry Blaskowitz were to take Bohemia under their protection,\r\n    while the troops of Army Group 5 under General of Inf. List were\r\n    given the same mission for Moravia.\r\n\r\n    “For this purpose parts of the Air Force (particularly\r\n    reconnaissance planes and antiaircraft artillery) as well as\r\n    parts of the _SS Verfuegungstruppen_ were placed at the disposal\r\n    of the two army groups.\r\n\r\n    “On the evening of March 14, the march order was received by the\r\n    troops. On March 15 at 6 A. M. the columns moved past the border\r\n    and then moved on with utmost precision. * * *” (_3571-PS_)\r\n\r\n(Other descriptions of the military movements of 14 and 15 March are\r\ncontained in documents _2860-PS_, _3618-PS_, and _3619-PS_.)\r\n\r\nAt dawn on 15 March German troops poured into Czechoslovakia from all\r\nsides. Hitler issued an order of the day to the Armed Forces and a\r\nproclamation to the German people, which stated succinctly,\r\n“Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.” (_TC-50_)\r\n\r\nOn the following day, in direct contravention of Article 81 of the\r\nTreaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia was formally incorporated into the\r\nGerman Reich under the name of the “Protectorate of Bohemia and\r\nMoravia.” This decree, signed in Prague on 16 March 1939 by Hitler,\r\nLammers, Frick, and Ribbentrop, commenced with this declaration:\r\n\r\n    “The Bohemian-Moravian countries belonged for a millennium to\r\n    the living space of the German people.” (_TC-51_)\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the decree sets forth in bleak detail the extent to\r\nwhich Czechoslovakia henceforth was to be subjugated to Germany. A\r\nGerman Protector was to be appointed by the Fuehrer for the so-called\r\nProtectorate. The German Government assumed charge of their foreign\r\naffairs and of their customs and their excise. It was specified that\r\nGerman garrisons and military establishments would be maintained in the\r\nProtectorate. (_TC-51_)\r\n\r\nAt the same time the extremist leaders in Slovakia, who at German\r\ninsistence had done so much to undermine the Czech State, found that the\r\nindependence of their week-old state was in fact qualified. A Treaty of\r\nProtection between Slovakia and the Reich was signed in Vienna on 18\r\nMarch and by Ribbentrop in Berlin on 23 March (_1439-PS_). A secret\r\nprotocol to this treaty was also signed in Berlin on 23 March by\r\nRibbentrop for Germany, and by Tuka and Durcansky for Slovakia\r\n(_2793-PS_). The first four articles of this treaty provide:\r\n\r\n    “The German Government and the Slovak Government have agreed,\r\n    after the Slovak State has placed itself under the protection of\r\n    the German Reich, to regulate by treaty the consequences\r\n    resulting from this fact. For this purpose the undersigned\r\n    representatives of the two governments have agreed on the\r\n    following provisions.\r\n\r\n    “ARTICLE 1. The German Reich undertakes to protect the political\r\n    independence of the State of Slovakia and the integrity of its\r\n    territory.\r\n\r\n    “ARTICLE 2. For the purpose of making effective the protection\r\n    undertaken by the German Reich, the German armed forces shall\r\n    have the right, at all times, to construct military\r\n    installations and to keep them garrisoned in the strength they\r\n    deem necessary, in an area delimited on its western side by the\r\n    frontiers of the State of Slovakia, and on its eastern side by a\r\n    line formed by the eastern rims of the Lower Carpathians, the\r\n    White Carpathians and the Javornik Mountains.\r\n\r\n    “The Government of Slovakia will take the necessary steps to\r\n    assure that the land required for these installations shall be\r\n    conveyed to the German armed forces. Furthermore the Government\r\n    of Slovakia will agree to grant exemption from custom duties for\r\n    imports from the Reich for the maintenance of the German troops\r\n    and the supply of military installations.\r\n\r\n    “Military sovereignty will be assumed by the German armed forces\r\n    in the zone described in the first paragraph of this Article.\r\n\r\n    “German citizens who, on the basis of private employment\r\n    contracts, are engaged in the construction of military\r\n    installations in the designated zone shall be subject to German\r\n    jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n    “ARTICLE 3. The Government of Slovakia will organize its\r\n    military forces in close agreement with the German armed forces.\r\n\r\n    “ARTICLE 4. In accordance with the relationship of protection\r\n    agreed upon, the Government of Slovakia will at all times\r\n    conduct its foreign affairs in close agreement with the German\r\n    Government.” (_1439-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe secret protocol provided for close economic and financial\r\ncollaboration between Germany and Slovakia. Mineral resources and\r\nsubsoil rights were placed at the disposal of the German government.\r\nArticle I, Paragraph 3, provided:\r\n\r\n    “(3) Investigation, development and utilization of the Slovak\r\n    natural resources. In this respect the basic principle is that\r\n    insofar as they are not needed to meet Slovakia’s own\r\n    requirements, they should be placed in first line at Germany’s\r\n    disposal. The entire soil-research (_Bodenforschung_) will be\r\n    placed under the Reich agency for soil-research (_Reichsstelle\r\n    fuer Bodenforschung_). The government of the Slovak State will\r\n    soon start an investigation to determine whether the present\r\n    owners of concessions and privileges have fulfilled the\r\n    industrial obligations prescribed by law and it will cancel\r\n    concessions and privileges in cases where these duties have been\r\n    neglected.” (_2793-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn their private conversations the Nazi conspirators gave abundant\r\nevidence that they considered Slovakia a puppet State, in effect a\r\nGerman possession. A memorandum of information given by Hitler to von\r\nBrauchitsch on 25 March 1939 deals in the main with problems arising\r\nfrom recently occupied Bohemia and Moravia and Slovakia. It states in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    “Col. Gen. Keitel shall inform Slovak Government via Foreign\r\n    Office that it would not be allowed to keep or garrison armed\r\n    Slovak units (Hlinka Guards) on this side of the border formed\r\n    by the river Waag. They shall be transferred to the new Slovak\r\n    territory. Hlinka Guards should be disarmed.\r\n\r\n    “Slovak shall be requested via Foreign Office to deliver to us\r\n    against payment any arms we want and which are still kept in\r\n    Slovakia. This request is to be based upon agreement made\r\n    between Army and Czech troops. For this payment these millions\r\n    should be used which we will pour anyhow into Slovakia.\r\n\r\n    “_Czech Protectorate._\r\n\r\n    “H. Gr. [translator’s note: probably Army groups] shall be asked\r\n    again whether the request shall be repeated again for the\r\n    delivery of all arms within a stated time limit and under the\r\n    threat of severe penalties.\r\n\r\n    “We take all war material of former Czechoslovakia _without_\r\n    paying for it. The guns bought by contract before 15 February\r\n    though shall be paid for.\r\n\r\n    “Bohemia-Moravia have to make annual contributions to the German\r\n    treasury. Their amount shall be fixed on the basis of the\r\n    expenses earmarked formerly for the Czech Army.” (_R-100_)\r\n\r\nThe German conquest of Czechoslovakia in direct contravention of the\r\nMunich agreement was the occasion for formal protests from the British\r\n(_TC-52_) and French (_TC-53_) governments, both dated 17 March 1939. On\r\nthe same day, 17 March 1939, the Acting Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates issued a statement which read in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * This Government, founded upon and dedicated to the\r\n    principles of human liberty and of democracy, cannot refrain\r\n    from making known this country’s condemnation of the acts which\r\n    have resulted in the temporary extinguishment of the liberties\r\n    of a free and independent people with whom, from the day when\r\n    the Republic of Czechoslovakia attained its independence, the\r\n    people of the United States have maintained specially close and\r\n    friendly relations.” (_2862-PS_)\r\n\r\nN. _The Importance of Czechoslovakia in Future Aggressions._\r\n\r\nWith Czechoslovakia in German hands, the Nazi conspirators had\r\naccomplished the program they had set for themselves in the meeting in\r\nBerlin on 5 November 1937 (_386-PS_). This program of conquest had been\r\nintended to shorten Germany’s frontiers, to increase its industrial and\r\nfood reserves, and to place it in a position, both industrially and\r\nstrategically, from which the Nazis could launch more ambitious and more\r\ndevastating campaigns of aggression. In less than a year and a half this\r\nprogram had been carried through to the satisfaction of the Nazi\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nOf all the Nazi conspirators perhaps Goering was the most aware of the\r\neconomic and strategic advantages which would accrue from the possession\r\nof Czechoslovakia. The Top Secret minutes of a conference with Goering\r\nin the Air Ministry, held on 14 October 1938—just two weeks after the\r\noccupation of the Sudetenland—reports a discussion of economic\r\nproblems. At this date Goering’s remarks were somewhat prophetic:\r\n\r\n    “The Sudetenland has to be exploited with all the means. General\r\n    Field Marshal Goering counts upon a complete industrial\r\n    assimilation of the Slovakia. Czechia and Slovakia would become\r\n    German dominions. Everything possible must be taken out. The\r\n    Oder-Danube Canal has to be speeded up. Searches for oil and ore\r\n    have to be conducted in Slovakia, notably by State Secretary\r\n    Keppler.” (_1301-PS, Item 10_)\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1939, after the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia\r\ninto the Reich, Goering again revealed the great interest of the Nazi\r\nleaders in the Czechoslovak economic potential. The minutes dated\r\nBerlin, 27 July 1939, and signed Mueller, of a conference two days\r\nearlier between Goering and a group of officials from the OKW and from\r\nother agencies of the German government concerned with war production,\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. In a rather long statement the Field Marshal explained that\r\n    the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia into the German economy\r\n    had taken place, among other reasons, to increase the German war\r\n    potential by exploitation of the industry there. Letters, such\r\n    as the decree of the Reich Minister for Economics—S 10 402/39\r\n    of 10 July 39—as well as a letter with similar meaning to the\r\n    JUNKERS firm, which might possibly lower the kind and extent of\r\n    the armament measures in the Protectorate, are contrary to this\r\n    principle. If it is necessary to issue such directives, this\r\n    should be done only with his consent. In any case, he insists,\r\n    in agreement with the directive by Hitler, that the war\r\n    potential of the Protectorate is definitely to be exploited in\r\n    part or in full and is to be directed towards mobilization as\r\n    soon as possible. * * *” (_R-133_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to strengthening the Nazi economic potential for war, the\r\nconquest of Czechoslovakia provided the Nazis with new bases from which\r\nto wage their next war of aggression, the attack on Poland. It will be\r\nrecalled that the minutes of the conference between Goering and a\r\npro-Nazi Slovak delegation in the winter of 1938-39 state Goering’s\r\nconclusions as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Air bases in Slovakia are of great importance for the German\r\n    Air Force for use against the East.” (_2801-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a conference between Goering, Mussolini, and Ciano on 15 April 1939,\r\none month after the conquest of Czechoslovakia, Goering told his junior\r\npartners in the Axis of the progress of German preparations for war. He\r\ncompared the strength of Germany with the strength of England and\r\nFrance. He mentioned the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    “However, the heavy armament of Czechoslovakia shows, in any\r\n    case, how dangerous this country could have been, even after\r\n    Munich, in the event of a serious conflict. Because of Germany’s\r\n    action the situation of both Axis countries was ameliorated,\r\n    among other reasons because of the economic possibilities which\r\n    result from the transfer to Germany of the great production\r\n    capacity (armament potential) of Czechoslovakia. That\r\n    contributes toward a considerable strengthening of the axis\r\n    against the Western powers. Furthermore, Germany now need not\r\n    keep ready a single division for protection against that country\r\n    in case of a bigger conflict. This, too, is an advantage by\r\n    which both axis countries will, in the last analysis, benefit.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * the action taken by Germany in Czechoslovakia is to be\r\n    viewed as an advantage for the axis in case Poland should\r\n    finally join the enemies of the axis powers. Germany could then\r\n    attack this country from 2 flanks and would be within only 25\r\n    minutes flying distance from the new Polish industrial center\r\n    which had been moved further into the interior of the country,\r\n    nearer to the other Polish industrial districts, because of its\r\n    proximity to the border. Now by the turn of events it is located\r\n    again in the proximity of the border.” (_1874-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe absorption of the Sudetenland, effected on 1 October 1938, in\r\npractical effect destroyed Czechoslovakia as a military power. The final\r\nconquest of Czechoslovakia came on 15 March 1939. This conquest had been\r\nthe intention and aim of the Nazi leaders during the preparations for\r\nCase Green in the summer of 1938, and had been forestalled only by the\r\nMunich agreement. With Czechoslovakia, less than six months after the\r\nMunich agreement, securely in German hands, the Nazi conspirators had\r\nachieved their objective. Bohemia and Moravia were incorporated into the\r\nReich, shortening German frontiers and adding the Czech manufacturing\r\nplant to the German war potential. The puppet state of Slovakia,\r\nconceived in Berlin and independent only in name, had been set up to the\r\neast of Moravia. In this state, which outflanked Poland to the south,\r\nthe Nazi army, under the terms of the treaty drafted by Ribbentrop, took\r\nupon itself the establishment of bases and extensive military\r\ninstallations. From this state in September 1939 units of the German\r\nArmy did, in fact, carry out the attack on Poland.\r\n\r\nLogic and premeditation are patent in each step of the German\r\naggression. Each conquest of the Nazi conspirators was deliberately\r\nplanned as a stepping-stone to new and more ambitious aggression. The\r\nwords of Hitler in the conference in the Reichs Chancellery on 23 May\r\n1939, when he was planning the Polish campaign, are significant,\r\n\r\n    “The period which lies behind us has indeed been put to good\r\n    use. All measures have been taken in the correct sequence and in\r\n    harmony with our aims.” (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nIt is appropriate to refer to two other speeches of the Nazi leaders. In\r\nhis lecture at Munich on 7 November 1943 Jodl spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The bloodless solution of the Czech conflict in the autumn of\r\n    1938 and spring of 1939 and the annexation of Slovakia rounded\r\n    off the territory of Greater Germany in such a way that it now\r\n    became possible to consider the Polish problem on the basis of\r\n    more or less favourable strategic premises.” (_L-172_)\r\n\r\nIn the speech to his military commanders on 23 November 1939, Hitler\r\ndescribed the process by which he had rebuilt the military power of the\r\nReich:\r\n\r\n    “The next step was Bohemia, Moravia and Poland. This step also\r\n    was not possible to accomplish in one campaign. First of all,\r\n    the western fortifications had to be finished. It was not\r\n    possible to reach the goal in one effort. It was clear to me\r\n    from the first moment that I could not be satisfied with the\r\n    Sudeten-German territory. That was only a partial solution. The\r\n    decision to march into Bohemia was made. Then followed the\r\n    erection of the Protectorate and with that the basis for the\r\n    action against Poland was laid.” (_789-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nLEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE EXECUTION OF THE\r\n                     PLAN TO INVADE CZECHOSLOVAKIA\r\n\r\n    Document     │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                 │                                        │      │\r\n                 │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                 │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                 │                                        │      │\r\n                 │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                 │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F) 3│      │\r\n                 │  (a, c); V.                            │  I   │  22, 29\r\n                 │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                 │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                 │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                 │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                 │trial.

OPENING ADDRESS FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n_The following address, opening the British presentation of the case\r\nunder Count II of the Indictment, was delivered by Sir Hartley\r\nShawcross, K.C., M.P., British Attorney General and Chief Prosecutor for\r\nthe United Kingdom, before the Tribunal on 4 December 1945._\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\nOn an occasion to which reference has already been made Hitler, the\r\nLeader of the Nazi Conspirators who are now on trial before you, said in\r\nreference to their warlike plans:\r\n\r\n    “I shall give a propagandist cause for starting the war, never\r\n    mind whether it be true or not. The victor shall not be asked\r\n    later on whether we tell the truth or not. In starting and\r\n    making a war not the right is what matters but victory—the\r\n    strongest has the right.” (_1014-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe British Empire has twice been victorious in wars which have been\r\nforced upon it within the space of one generation but it is precisely\r\nbecause we realize that victory is not enough; that might is not\r\nnecessarily right; that lasting peace and the rule of International Law\r\nis not to be achieved by the strong arm alone, that the British Nation\r\nis taking part in this trial. There are those who would perhaps say that\r\nthese wretched men should have been dealt with summarily without trial\r\nby “executive action”; that their personal power for evil broken, they\r\nshould be swept aside into oblivion without this elaborate and careful\r\ninvestigation as to the part they played in plunging the world in war.\r\n_Vae Victis._ Let them pay the penalty of defeat. But that is not the\r\nview of the British Empire or of the British Government. Not so would\r\nthe Rule of Law be raised and strengthened on the international as well\r\nas the municipal plane; not so would future generations realize that\r\nright is not always on the side of the big battalions; not so would the\r\nworld be made aware that the waging of aggressive war is not only a\r\ndangerous venture but a criminal one. Human memory is short. Apologists\r\nfor defeated nations are sometimes able to play upon the sympathy and\r\nmagnanimity of their victors so that the true facts, never\r\nauthoritatively recorded, become obscured and forgotten. One has only to\r\nrecall the circumstances following the last world war to see the dangers\r\nto which, in the absence of any authoritative judicial pronouncement a\r\ntolerant or a credulous people is exposed. With the passage of time the\r\nformer tend to discount, perhaps because of their very horror, the\r\nstories of aggression and atrocity which may be handed down; the latter,\r\nmisled by fanatical and dishonest propagandists, come to believe that it\r\nwas not they but their opponents who were guilty of what they would\r\nthemselves condemn. And so we believe that this Tribunal, acting, as we\r\nknow it will act notwithstanding its appointment by the victorious\r\npowers, with complete and judicial objectivity, will provide a\r\ncontemporary touchstone and an authoritative and impartial record to\r\nwhich future historians may turn for truth and future politicians for\r\nwarning. From this record all generations shall know not only what our\r\ngeneration suffered but also that our suffering was the result of crimes\r\nagainst the laws of peoples which the peoples of the world enforced and\r\nwill continue in the future to uphold by international cooperation, not\r\nbased merely on military alliances but firmly grounded in the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nNor, though this procedure and this Indictment of individuals may be\r\nnovel, is there anything new in the principles which by this prosecution\r\nwe seek to enforce. Ineffective though, alas, the sanctions proved\r\nthemselves to be, the Nations of the world had, as it will be my purpose\r\nto show, sought to make aggressive war an international crime, and\r\nalthough previous tradition has sought to punish States rather than\r\nindividuals, it is both logical and right that if the act of waging war\r\nis itself an offense against International Law those individuals who\r\nshared personal responsibility for bringing such wars about should\r\nanswer personally for the course into which they lead their states.\r\nAgain, individual war crimes have long been regarded by International\r\nLaw as triable by the Courts of those States whose nationals have been\r\noutraged at least so long as a state of war persists. It would indeed be\r\nillogical in the extreme if those who, although they may not with their\r\nown hands have committed individual crimes, were responsible for\r\nsystematic breaches of the laws of war affecting the nationals of many\r\nStates should escape. So also in regard to crimes against humanity. The\r\nright of humanitarian intervention on behalf of the rights of man\r\ntrampled upon by the State in a manner shocking the sense of mankind has\r\nlong been considered to form part of the law of Nations. Here, too, the\r\nCharter merely develops a pre-existing principle. If murder, raping and\r\nrobbery are indictable under the ordinary municipal laws of our\r\ncountries shall those who differ only from the common criminal by the\r\nextent and systematic nature of their offenses escape accusation?\r\n\r\nIt is, as I shall show, the view of the British Government that in these\r\nmatters the Tribunal will apply to individuals not the law of the victor\r\nbut the accepted principles of international usage in a way which will,\r\nif anything can, promote and fortify the rule of International Law and\r\nsafeguard the future peace and security of this war-stricken world.\r\n\r\nBy agreement between the Chief Prosecutors it is my task on behalf of\r\nthe British Government and of the other States associated on this\r\nProsecution to present the case on Count 2 of the Indictment and to show\r\nhow these Defendants in conspiracy with each other and with persons not\r\nnow before this Tribunal planned and waged a war of aggression in breach\r\nof the Treaty obligations by which, under International Law Germany, as\r\nother States, had sought to make such wars impossible.\r\n\r\nThat task falls into two parts. The first is to demonstrate the nature\r\nand the basis of the Crime against Peace which, under the Charter of\r\nthis Tribunal, is constituted by waging wars of aggression and in\r\nviolation of Treaties. The second is to establish beyond doubt that such\r\nwars were waged by these Defendants.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, it would no doubt be sufficient to say this. It is not\r\nincumbent upon the Prosecution to prove that wars of aggression and wars\r\nin violation of International Treaties are, or ought to be,\r\nInternational Crimes. The Charter of this Tribunal has prescribed that\r\nthey are crimes and that the Charter is the Statute and the law of this\r\nCourt. Yet, though that is the clear and mandatory law governing the\r\njurisdiction of this Tribunal, we feel that we should not be fully\r\ndischarging our task in the abiding interest alike of international\r\njustice and morality unless we showed the position of that provision of\r\nthe Charter against the whole perspective of International Law. For just\r\nas some old English Statutes were substantially declaratory of the\r\nCommon Law, so this Charter substantially declares and creates a\r\njurisdiction in respect of what was already the Laws of Nations.\r\n\r\nNor is it unimportant to emphasize that aspect of the matter lest there\r\nbe some, now or hereafter, who might allow their judgment to be warped\r\nby plausible catchwords or by an uninformed and distorted sense of\r\njustice towards these Defendants. It is not difficult to be misled by\r\nsuch phrases as that resort to war in the past has not been a crime;\r\nthat the power to resort to war is one of the prerogatives of the\r\nsovereign State; that the Charter in constituting wars of aggression a\r\ncrime has imitated one of the most obnoxious doctrines of National\r\nSocialist jurisprudence, namely _post factum_ legislation; that the\r\nCharter is in this respect reminiscent of Bills of Attainder—and that\r\nthese proceedings are no more than a measure of vengeance, subtly\r\nconcealed in the garb of judicial proceedings which the Victor wreaks\r\nupon the Vanquished. These things may sound plausible—yet they are not\r\ntrue. It is, indeed, not necessary to doubt that some aspects of the\r\nCharter bear upon them the imprint of significant and salutary novelty.\r\nBut it is our submission and conviction, which we affirm before this\r\nTribunal and the world that fundamentally the provision of the Charter\r\nwhich constitutes such wars as these Defendants joined in waging and in\r\nplanning a crime is not in any way an innovation. That provision does no\r\nmore than constitute a competent jurisdiction for the punishment of what\r\nnot only the enlightened conscience of mankind but the Law of Nations\r\nitself constituted an International Crime before this Tribunal was\r\nestablished and this Charter became part of the public law of the world.\r\n\r\nSo first let this be said. Whilst it may be true that there is no body\r\nof international rules amounting to law in the Austinian sense of a rule\r\nimposed by a sovereign upon a subject obliged to obey it under some\r\ndefinite sanction, yet for fifty years or more the people of the world,\r\nstriving perhaps after that ideal of which the poet speaks:\r\n\r\n    When the War Drums throb no longer\r\n    And the Battle Flags are furled,\r\n    In the Parliament of Man,\r\n    The Federation of the World\r\n\r\nhave sought to create an operative system of rules based on the consent\r\nof nations to stabilize international relations, to avoid war taking\r\nplace at all and to mitigate the results of such wars as took place. The\r\nfirst such treaty was of course the Hague Convention of 1899 for the\r\nPacific Settlement of International Disputes. This was, indeed, of\r\nlittle more than precatory effect and we attach no weight to it for the\r\npurpose of this case, but it did establish agreement that in the event\r\nof serious disputes arising between the signatory powers, they would so\r\nfar as possible submit to mediation. That Convention was followed in\r\n1907 by another Convention reaffirming and slightly strengthening what\r\nhad previously been agreed. These early conventions fell indeed very far\r\nshort of outlawing war or of creating any binding obligation to\r\narbitrate. I shall certainly not ask you to say any crime was committed\r\nby disregarding them. But at least they established that the contracting\r\npowers accepted the general principle that if at all possible war should\r\nbe resorted to only if mediation failed.\r\n\r\nAlthough these Conventions are mentioned in the Indictment I do not rely\r\non them save to show the historical development of the law. It is\r\nunnecessary, therefore, to argue about their effect, for their place has\r\nbeen taken by more effective instruments. They were the first steps.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, other individual agreements between particular\r\nStates which sought to preserve the neutrality of individual countries\r\nas, for instance, that of Belgium, but those agreements were, in the\r\nabsence of any real will to comply with them, entirely inadequate to\r\nprevent the first World War in 1914.\r\n\r\nShocked by the occurrence of that catastrophe the Nations of Europe, not\r\nexcluding Germany, and of other parts of the World came to the\r\nconclusion that in the interests of all alike a permanent organization\r\nof the Nations should be established to maintain the peace. And so the\r\nTreaty of Versailles was prefaced by the Covenant of the League of\r\nNations.\r\n\r\nI say nothing at this moment of the general merits of the various\r\nprovisions of the Treaty of Versailles. They have been criticized, some\r\nof them perhaps justly, and they were made the subject of much warlike\r\npropaganda in Germany. But it is unnecessary to enquire into the merits\r\nof the matter, for however unjust one might for this purpose assume the\r\nTreaty to be, it contained no kind of excuse for the waging of war to\r\nsecure an alteration in its terms. For not only was it a settlement by\r\nagreement of all the difficult territorial questions which had been left\r\noutstanding by the war itself but it established the League of Nations\r\nwhich, if it had been loyally supported, could so well have resolved\r\nthose international differences which might otherwise have led, as they\r\ndid lead, to war. It set up in the Council of the League, in the\r\nAssembly and in the Permanent Court of International Justice, a machine\r\nnot only for the peaceful settlement of international disputes but also\r\nfor the ventilation of all international questions by frank and open\r\ndiscussion. At the time the hopes of the world stood high. Millions of\r\nmen in all countries—perhaps even in Germany—had laid down their lives\r\nin what they believed and hoped to be a war to end war. Germany herself\r\nentered the League and was given a permanent seat on the Council, on\r\nwhich, as in the Assembly, German Governments which preceded that of the\r\nDefendant Von Papen in 1932 played their full part. In the years from\r\n1919 to 1932 despite some minor incidents in the heated atmosphere which\r\nfollowed the end of the war, the peaceful operation of the League\r\ncontinued. Nor was it only the operation of the League which gave good\r\nground for hope that at long last the rule of law would replace that of\r\nanarchy in the international field.\r\n\r\nThe Statesmen of the world deliberately set out to make wars of\r\naggression an international Crime. These are no new terms, invented by\r\nthe Victors to embody in this Charter. They have figured prominently in\r\nnumerous treaties, in governmental pronouncements and in declarations of\r\nStatesmen in the period preceding the Second World War. In treaties\r\nconcluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other\r\nStates—such as Persia (1 October 1927), France (2 May 1935), China (21\r\nAugust 1937)—the Contracting Parties undertook to refrain from any act\r\nof aggression whatsoever against the other Party. In 1933 the Soviet\r\nUnion became a party to a large number of treaties containing a detailed\r\ndefinition of aggression. The same definition appeared in the same year\r\nin the authoritative Report of the Committee on Questions of Security\r\nset up in connection with the Conference for the Reduction and the\r\nLimitation of Armaments. But States went beyond commitments to refrain\r\nfrom wars of aggression and to assist States victims of aggression. They\r\n_condemned_ wars of aggression. Thus in the Anti-War Treaty of\r\nNon-Aggression and Conciliation of 10 October 1933, a number of American\r\nStates—subsequently joined by practically all the States of the\r\nAmerican Continent and a number of European countries—the Contracting\r\nParties solemnly declared that “they condemned wars of aggression in\r\ntheir mutual relations or in those of other States.” That Treaty was\r\nfully incorporated into the Buenos Aires Convention of December 1936\r\nsigned and ratified by a large number of American countries, including\r\nthe United States of America. Previously, in February 1928, the Sixth\r\nPan-American Conference adopted a Resolution declaring that as “war of\r\naggression constitutes a crime against the human species * * * all\r\naggression is illicit and as such is declared prohibited.” In September\r\n1927 the Assembly of the League of Nations adopted a resolution\r\naffirming the conviction that “a war of aggression can never serve as a\r\nmeans of settling international disputes _and is, in consequence, an\r\ninternational crime_” and declaring that “all wars of aggression are,\r\nand shall always be, prohibited.” The first Article of the Draft Treaty\r\nfor Mutual Assistance of 1923 reads: “The High Contracting Parties,\r\naffirming that aggressive war is an international crime, undertake the\r\nsolemn engagement not to make themselves guilty of this crime against\r\nany other nation.” In the Preamble to the Geneva Protocol of 1924 it was\r\nstated that “offensive warfare constitutes an infraction of solidarity\r\nand an international crime.” These instruments remained unratified, for\r\nvarious reasons, but they are not without significance or instruction.\r\n\r\nThese repeated condemnations of wars of aggression testified to the fact\r\nthat, with the establishment of the League of Nations and with the legal\r\ndevelopments which followed it, the place of war in International Law\r\nhad undergone a profound change. War was ceasing to be the unrestricted\r\nprerogative of sovereign States. The Covenant of the League did not\r\ntotally abolish the right of war. It left certain gaps which probably\r\nwere larger in theory than in practice. In effect it surrounded the\r\nright of war by procedural and substantive checks and delays which, if\r\nthe Covenant had been observed, would have amounted to an elimination of\r\nwar not only between Members of the League, but also, by virtue of\r\ncertain provisions of the Covenant, in the relations of non-Members.\r\nThus the Covenant restored the position as it existed at the dawn of\r\nInternational Law, at the time when Grotius was laying the foundations\r\nof the modern law of nations and established the distinction,\r\naccompanied by profound legal consequences in the sphere of neutrality,\r\nbetween just and unjust wars.\r\n\r\nNeither was that development arrested with the adoption of the Covenant.\r\nThe right of war was further circumscribed by a series of\r\ntreaties—numbering nearly one thousand—of arbitration and conciliation\r\nembracing practically all the nations of the world. The so-called\r\nOptional Clause of Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of\r\nInternational Justice which conferred upon the Court compulsory\r\njurisdiction with regard to most comprehensive categories of disputes\r\nand which constituted in effect the most important compulsory treaty of\r\narbitration in the post-war period, was widely signed and ratified.\r\nGermany herself signed it in 1927; her signature was renewed and\r\nrenewed, for a period of five years, by the National-Socialist\r\nGovernment in July 1933. (Significantly, that ratification was not\r\nrenewed on the expiration of its validity in March 1938.) Since 1928 a\r\nconsiderable number of States signed and ratified the General Act for\r\nthe Pacific Settlement of International Disputes which was designed to\r\nfill the gaps left by the Optional Clause and the existing treaties of\r\narbitration and conciliation.\r\n\r\nAll this vast network of instruments of pacific settlement testified to\r\nthe growing conviction that war was ceasing to be the normal and\r\nlegitimate means of settling international disputes. The express\r\ncondemnation of wars of aggression, which has already been mentioned,\r\nsupplied the same testimony. But there was more direct evidence pointing\r\nin that direction. The Treaty of Locarno of 16th October 1925, to which\r\nI will refer later and to which Germany was a party, was more than a\r\ntreaty of arbitration and conciliation in which the parties undertook\r\ndefinite obligations with regard to the pacific settlement of disputes\r\nthat might arise between them. It was, subject to clearly specified\r\nexceptions of self-defense in certain contingencies, a more general\r\nundertaking in which the parties agreed that “they will in no case\r\nattack or invade each other or resort to war against each other”. This\r\nconstituted a general renunciation of war and was so considered to be in\r\nthe eyes of jurists and of the public opinion of the world. For the\r\nLocarno Treaty was not just one of the great number of arbitration\r\ntreaties concluded at that time. It was regarded as the cornerstone of\r\nthe European settlement and of the new legal order in Europe in partial,\r\nvoluntary and generous substitution for the just rigours of the Treaty\r\nof Versailles. With it the term “outlawry of war” left the province of\r\nmere pacifist propaganda. It became current in the writings on\r\ninternational law and in official pronouncements of governments. No\r\njurist of authority and no statesman of responsibility would have\r\nassociated himself, subsequent to the Locarno Treaty, with the plausible\r\nassertion that, at least as between the parties, war had remained an\r\nunrestricted right of sovereign States.\r\n\r\nBut although the effect of the Locarno Treaty was limited to the parties\r\nto it, it had a wider influence in paving the way towards that most\r\nfundamental and truly revolutionary enactment in modern international\r\nlaw, namely, the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War of 27 August\r\n1928, known also as the Pact of Paris, or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, or\r\nthe Kellogg Pact. That Treaty—a most deliberate and carefully prepared\r\npiece of international legislation—was binding in 1939 upon more than\r\nsixty nations, including Germany. It was—and has remained—the most\r\nwidely signed and ratified international instrument. It contained no\r\nprovision for its termination, and was conceived as the cornerstone of\r\nany future international order worthy of that name. It is fully part of\r\ninternational law as it stands today, and has in no way been modified or\r\nreplaced by the Charter of the United Nations. It is right, in this\r\nsolemn hour in the history of the world when the responsible leaders of\r\na State stand accused of a premeditated breach of this great Treaty\r\nwhich was—and remains—a source of hope and faith for mankind, to set\r\nout in detail its two operative Articles and its Preamble:\r\n\r\n                             “The Preamble\r\n\r\n    “The President of the German Reich, * * *\r\n\r\n    “Deeply sensible of their solemn duty to promote the welfare of\r\n    mankind;\r\n\r\n    “Persuaded that the time has come when a frank renunciation of\r\n    war as an instrument of national policy should be made to the\r\n    end that the peaceful and friendly relations now existing\r\n    between their peoples may be perpetuated;\r\n\r\n    “Convinced that all changes in their relations with one another\r\n    should be sought only by pacific means and be the result of a\r\n    peaceful and orderly progress, and that any signatory Power\r\n    which shall hereafter seek to promote its national interests by\r\n    resort to war should be denied the benefits furnished by this\r\n    Treaty;\r\n\r\n    “Hopeful that, encouraged by their example, all the other\r\n    nations of the world will join in this humane endeavour and by\r\n    adhering to the present Treaty as soon as it comes into force\r\n    bring their peoples within the scope of its beneficent\r\n    provisions, thus uniting civilized nations of the world in a\r\n    common renunciation of war as an instrument of their national\r\n    policy;\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n                               “Article I\r\n\r\n    “The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of\r\n    their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for\r\n    the solution of international controversies, and renounce it as\r\n    an instrument of national policy in their relations with one\r\n    another.\r\n\r\n                              “Article II\r\n\r\n    “The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or\r\n    solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of\r\n    whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall\r\n    never be sought except by pacific means.”\r\n\r\nIn that General Treaty for the Renunciation of War practically the\r\nentire civilized world abolished war as a legally permissible means of\r\nenforcing the law and of changing it. The right of war was no longer of\r\nthe essence of sovereignty. Whatever the position may have been in 1914\r\nor in 1918 (and it is not necessary to discuss it) no International\r\nlawyer of repute, no responsible Statesman, no soldier concerned with\r\nthe legal use of Armed Forces could doubt that with the Pact of Paris on\r\nthe Statute Book a war of aggression was contrary to positive\r\nInternational Law. Nor have the repeated violations of the Pact of the\r\nAxis Powers in any way affected its validity. Let this be firmly and\r\nclearly stated. Those very breaches, except to the cynic and the\r\nmalevolent, have added to its strength; they provoked the sustained\r\nwrath of people angered by the contemptuous disregard of the great\r\nStatute and determined to vindicate its provisions. The Pact of Paris is\r\nthe Law of Nations. This Tribunal will enforce it.\r\n\r\nLet this also be said. The Pact of Paris was not a clumsy enactment\r\nlikely to become a signpost for the guilty. It did not enable Germany to\r\ngo to war against Poland and yet rely, as against Great Britain and\r\nFrance, on any immunity from warlike action because of the provisions of\r\nthe Pact of Paris. For that Pact laid down expressly in its Preamble\r\nthat no State guilty of a violation of its provisions may invoke its\r\nbenefits. When on the outbreak of the Second World War Great Britain and\r\nFrance communicated to the League of Nations the fact that a state of\r\nwar existed between them and Germany as from 3 September, 1939, they\r\ndeclared that by committing an act of aggression against Poland Germany\r\nhad violated her obligations assumed not only towards Poland but also\r\ntowards other signatories of the Pact of Paris. A violation of the Pact\r\nin relation to one signatory was an attack upon all the other\r\nsignatories and they were fully entitled to treat it as such. This point\r\nis to be emphasized lest any of the defendants should seize upon the\r\nletter of the Particulars of Count Two of the Indictment and maintain\r\nthat it was not Germany who initiated war with the United Kingdom and\r\nFrance on 3 September 1939. The declaration of war came from the United\r\nKingdom and France; the act of war and its commencement came from\r\nGermany in violation of the fundamental enactment to which she was a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe General Treaty for the Renunciation of War, the great constitutional\r\ninstrument of an international society awakened to the deadly dangers of\r\nanother Armageddon, did not remain an isolated effort soon to be\r\nforgotten in the turmoil of recurrent international crises. It became,\r\nin conjunction with the Covenant of the League of Nations or\r\nindependently of it, the starting point for a new orientation of\r\ngovernments in matters of peace, war and neutrality. It is of importance\r\nto quote some of these statements and declarations. In 1929, His\r\nMajesty’s Government in the United Kingdom said, in connection with the\r\nquestion of conferring upon the Permanent Court of International Justice\r\njurisdiction with regard to the exercise of belligerent rights in\r\nrelation to neutral States:\r\n\r\n    “* * * But the whole situation * * * rests, and International\r\n    Law on the subject has been entirely built up, on the assumption\r\n    that there is nothing illegitimate in the use of war as an\r\n    instrument of national policy, and, as a necessary corollary,\r\n    that the position and rights of neutrals are entirely\r\n    independent of the circumstances of any war which may be in\r\n    progress. Before the acceptance of the Covenant, the basis of\r\n    the law of neutrality was that the rights and obligations of\r\n    neutrals were identical as regards both belligerents, and were\r\n    entirely independent of the rights and wrongs of the dispute\r\n    which had led to the war, or the respective position of the\r\n    belligerents at the bar of world opinion.\r\n\r\n    “* * * Now it is precisely this assumption which is no longer\r\n    valid as regards states which are members of the League of\r\n    Nations and parties to the Peace Pact. The effect of those\r\n    instruments, taken together, is to deprive nations of the right\r\n    to employ war as an instrument of national policy, and to forbid\r\n    the states which have signed them to give aid or comfort to an\r\n    offender. As between such states, there has been in consequence\r\n    a fundamental change in the whole question of belligerent and\r\n    neutral rights. The whole policy of His Majesty’s present\r\n    Government (and, it would appear, of any alternative government)\r\n    is based upon a determination to comply with their obligations\r\n    under the Covenant of the League and the Peace Pact. This being\r\n    so, the situation which we have to envisage in the event of a\r\n    war in which we were engaged is not one in which the rights and\r\n    duties of belligerents and neutrals will depend upon the old\r\n    rules of war and neutrality, but one in which the position of\r\n    the members of the League will be determined by the Covenant and\r\n    the Pact. * * *” (Memorandum on the Signature of His Majesty’s\r\n    Government in the United Kingdom of the Optional Clause of the\r\n    Statute, Misc. No. 12 (1929), Cmd. 3452, p. 9).\r\n\r\nChief of Counsel for the United States referred in his opening speech\r\nbefore this Tribunal to the weighty pronouncement of Mr. Stimson, the\r\nSecretary of State, in which, in 1932, he gave expression to the drastic\r\nchange brought about in International Law by the Pact of Paris. It is\r\nconvenient to quote the relevant passage in full:\r\n\r\n    “War between nations was renounced by the signatories of the\r\n    Briand-Kellogg Treaty. This means that it has become illegal\r\n    throughout practically the entire world. It is no longer to be\r\n    the source and subject of rights. It is no longer to be the\r\n    principle around which the duties, the conduct, and the rights\r\n    of nations revolve. It is an illegal thing. Hereafter when two\r\n    nations engage in armed conflict either one or both of them must\r\n    be wrongdoers—violators of this general treaty law. We no\r\n    longer draw a circle about them and treat them with the\r\n    punctilios of the duelist’s code. Instead we denounce them as\r\n    law-breakers.”\r\n\r\nNearly ten years later, when numerous independent States lay prostrate,\r\nshattered or menaced in their very existence before the impact of the\r\nwar machine of the Nazi State, the Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates—subsequently a distinguished member of the highest tribunal of\r\nthat great country—gave weighty expression to the change which had been\r\neffected in the law as the result of the General Treaty for the\r\nRenunciation of War. He said on 27 March 1941:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, in which Germany, Italy\r\n    and Japan covenanted with us, as well as with other nations, to\r\n    renounce war as an instrument of policy, made definite the\r\n    outlawry of war and of necessity altered the dependent concept\r\n    of neutral obligations.\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Treaty for the Renunciation of War and the Argentine\r\n    Anti-War Treaty deprived their signatories of the right of war\r\n    as an instrument of national policy or aggression and rendered\r\n    unlawful wars undertaken in violation of their provisions. In\r\n    consequence, these treaties destroyed the historical and\r\n    juridical foundations of the doctrine of neutrality conceived as\r\n    an attitude of absolute impartiality in relation to aggressive\r\n    wars. * * *\r\n\r\n    “It follows that the state which has gone to war in violation of\r\n    its obligations acquires no right to equality of treatment from\r\n    other states, unless treaty obligations require different\r\n    handling of affairs. It derives no rights from its illegality.\r\n\r\n    “* * * In flagrant cases of aggression where the facts speak so\r\n    unambiguously that world opinion takes what may be the\r\n    equivalent of judicial notice, we may not stymie International\r\n    Law and allow these great treaties to become dead letters.\r\n    Intelligent public opinion of the world which is not afraid to\r\n    be vocal and the action of the American States has made a\r\n    determination that the Axis Powers are the aggressors in the\r\n    wars today which is an appropriate basis in the present state of\r\n    international organization for our policy. * * *”\r\n\r\nThere is thus no doubt that by the time the National-Socialist State had\r\nembarked upon the preparation of the war of aggression against the\r\ncivilized world and by the time it had accomplished that design,\r\naggressive war had, in virtue of the Pact of Paris and of other\r\ntreaties, become illegal beyond all uncertainty and doubt. It is on that\r\nUniversal Treaty that Count 2 is principally based.\r\n\r\nThe Prosecution has deemed it necessary—indeed imperative—to establish\r\nbeyond all possibility of doubt, at what may appear to be excessive\r\nlength, that only superficial learning or culpable sentimentality can\r\nassert that there is any significant element of retroactive law in the\r\ndetermination of the authors of the Charter to treat aggressive war as\r\nconduct which International Law has prohibited and stigmatized as\r\ncriminal. We have traced the progressive limitation of the right of war,\r\nthe renunciation and condemnation of wars of aggression, and, above all,\r\nthe total prohibition and condemnation of all war conceived as an\r\ninstrument of national policy. What statesman or politician in charge of\r\nthe affairs of a nation could doubt, from 1928 onwards, that aggressive\r\nwar, that all war—except in self-defense, or for the collective\r\nenforcement of the law, or against a State which has itself violated the\r\nPact of Paris—was unlawful and outlawed? What statesman or politician\r\nembarking upon such war could reasonably and justifiably count upon an\r\nimmunity other than that by a successful outcome of the criminal\r\nventure? What more decisive evidence of a prohibition laid down by\r\npositive International Law could any lawyer desire than that which has\r\nbeen adduced here?\r\n\r\nThere are, it is true, some small town lawyers who deny the existence of\r\nany International Law. Indeed, as I have said, the rules of the law of\r\nNations may not satisfy the Austinian test of being imposed by a\r\nsovereign. But the legal regulation of International Relations rests\r\nupon quite different juridical foundations. It depends upon consent, but\r\nupon consent which cannot be withdrawn by unilateral action. In the\r\nInternational field the source of law is not the command of a sovereign\r\nbut the treaty agreement binding upon every state which has adhered to\r\nit. It is indeed true—and the recognition of its truth today by all the\r\ngreat Powers of the World is vital to our future peace—that as M.\r\nLitvinoff once said, and as Great Britain fully accepts, “Absolute\r\nSovereignty and entire liberty of action only belong to such states as\r\nhave not undertaken International obligations. Immediately a state\r\naccepts International obligations it limits its sovereignty”.\r\n\r\nYet it may be argued that although war had been outlawed and forbidden\r\nit was not criminally outlawed and forbidden. International Law, it may\r\nbe said, does not attribute criminality to states, still less to\r\nindividuals. But can it really be said on behalf of these Defendants\r\nthat the offense of these aggressive wars, which plunged millions of\r\npeoples to their deaths, which by dint of war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity brought about the torture and extermination of countless\r\nthousands of innocent civilians; which devastated cities; which\r\ndestroyed the amenities—nay the most rudimentary necessities of\r\ncivilization in many countries, which has brought the world to the brink\r\nof ruin from which it will take generations to recover—will it\r\nseriously be said that such a war is only an offense, only an\r\nillegality, only a matter of condemnation and not a crime justiciable by\r\nany Tribunal? No Law worthy of the name can permit itself to be reduced\r\nto an absurdity. Certainly the Great Powers responsible for this Charter\r\nhave refused to allow it. They drew the inescapable consequences from\r\nthe renunciation, prohibition, and condemnation of war which had become\r\npart of the law of Nations. They refused to reduce justice to impotence\r\nby subscribing to the outworn doctrines that the sovereign state can\r\ncommit no crime and that no crime can be committed by individuals on its\r\nbehalf. Their refusal so to stultify themselves has decisively shaped\r\nthe law of this Tribunal.\r\n\r\nIf this be an innovation, it is innovation long overdue—a desirable and\r\nbeneficent innovation fully consistent with justice, with common sense\r\nand with the abiding purposes of the law of Nations. But is it indeed so\r\nclear an innovation? Or is it no more than the logical development of\r\nthe law? There was indeed a time when International lawyers used to\r\nmaintain that the liability of a State was, because of its sovereignty,\r\nlimited to contractual responsibility. International tribunals have not\r\naccepted that view. They have repeatedly affirmed that a State can\r\ncommit a tort; that it may be guilty of trespass, of a nuisance, of\r\nnegligence. They have gone further. They have held that a State may be\r\nbound to pay what are in effect penal damages for failing to provide\r\nproper conditions of security to aliens residing within their territory.\r\nIn a recent case decided in 1935 between the United States and Canada an\r\narbitral commission, with the concurrence of its American member,\r\ndecided that the United States were bound to pay what amounted to penal\r\ndamages for an affront to Canadian sovereignty. On a wider plane the\r\nCovenant of the League of Nations, in providing for sanctions,\r\nrecognized the principle of enforcement of the law against collective\r\nunits—such enforcement to be, if necessary, of a penal character. There\r\nis thus nothing startlingly new in the adoption of the principle that\r\nthe State as such is responsible for its criminal acts. In fact, save\r\nfor the reliance on the unconvincing argument of sovereignty, there is\r\nin law no reason why a State should not be answerable for crimes\r\ncommitted on its behalf. In a case decided nearly one hundred years ago\r\nDr. Lushington, a great English Admiralty judge, refused to admit that a\r\nState cannot be a pirate. History, very recent history, does not warrant\r\nthe view that a State cannot be a criminal. On the contrary, the\r\nimmeasurable potentialities for evil inherent in the State in this age\r\nof science and organization would seem to demand imperatively means of\r\nrepression of criminal conduct even more drastic and more effective than\r\nin the case of individuals. In so far therefore as the Charter has put\r\non record the principle of the criminal responsibility of the State it\r\nmust be applauded as a wise and far-seeing measure of international\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the conscience shrinks from the rigours of collective\r\npunishment, which fall upon the guilty and the innocent alike—although,\r\nit may be noted, most of those innocent victims would not have hesitated\r\nto reap the fruits of the criminal act if it had been successful.\r\nHumanity and justice will find means of mitigating any injustice of\r\ncollective punishment. Above all, much hardship can be obviated by\r\nmaking the punishment fall upon the individuals directly responsible for\r\nthe criminal conduct of the State. It is here that the Powers who framed\r\nthe Charter took a step which justice, sound legal sense and an\r\nenlightened appreciation of the good of mankind must acclaim without\r\ncavil or reserve. The Charter lays down expressly that there shall be\r\nindividual responsibility for the crimes, including the crime against\r\nthe peace, committed on behalf of the State. The State is not an\r\nabstract entity. Its rights and duties are the rights and duties of men.\r\nIts actions are the actions of men. It is a salutory principle of the\r\nlaw that politicians who embark upon a war of aggression should not be\r\nable to seek immunity behind the intangible personality of the State. It\r\nis a salutory legal rule that persons who, in violation of the law,\r\nplunge their own and other countries into an aggressive war, do so with\r\na halter round their necks.\r\n\r\nTo say that those who aid and abet, who counsel and procure a crime are\r\nthemselves criminals is a commonplace in our own municipal\r\njurisprudence. Nor is the principle of individual international\r\nresponsibility for offenses against the law of nations altogether new.\r\nIt has been applied not only to pirates. The entire law relating to war\r\ncrimes—as distinguished from the crime of war—is based on that\r\nprinciple. The future of International Law and, indeed, of the world,\r\ndepends on its application in a much wider sphere—in particular in that\r\nof safeguarding the peace of the world. There must be acknowledged not\r\nonly, as in the Charter of the United Nations, fundamental human rights,\r\nbut also, as in the Charter of this Tribunal, fundamental human duties.\r\nOf these none is more vital or more fundamental than the duty not to vex\r\nthe peace of nations in violation of the clearest legal prohibitions and\r\nundertakings. If this is an innovation, then it is one which we are\r\nprepared to defend and to justify. It is not an innovation which creates\r\na new crime. International Law had already, before the Charter was\r\nadopted, constituted aggressive war a criminal act.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore in this respect no substantial retroactivity in the\r\nprovisions of the Charter. It merely fixes the responsibility for a\r\ncrime, clearly established as such by positive law, upon its actual\r\nperpetrators. It fills a gap in international criminal procedure. There\r\nis all the difference between saying to a man: “You will now be punished\r\nfor an act which was not a crime at the time you committed it”, and\r\ntelling him: “You will now pay the penalty for conduct which was\r\ncontrary to law and a crime when you executed it though, owing to the\r\nimperfection of international machinery, there was at that time no court\r\ncompetent to pronounce judgment against you.” If that be retroactivity,\r\nwe proclaim it to be most fully consistent with that higher justice\r\nwhich, in the practice of civilized States, has set a definite limit to\r\nthe retroactive operation of laws. Let the defendants and their\r\nprotagonists complain that the Charter is in this as in other matters an\r\n_ex parte_ fiat of the victor. These victors, composing as they do the\r\noverwhelming majority of the nations of the world, represent also the\r\nworld’s sense of justice which would be outraged if the crime of war,\r\nafter this second World War, were to remain unpunished. In thus\r\ninterpreting, declaring and supplementing the existing law they are\r\ncontent to be judged by the verdict of history. _Securus judicat orbis\r\nterrarum._ In so far as the Charter of this Tribunal introduces new law,\r\nits authors have established a precedent for the future—a precedent\r\noperative against all, including themselves. In essence that law,\r\nrendering recourse to aggressive war an international crime, had been\r\nwell established when the Charter was adopted. It is only by way of\r\ncorruption of language that it can be described as a retroactive law.\r\n\r\nThere remains the question, with which it will not be necessary to\r\ndetain the Tribunal for long, whether these wars launched by Germany and\r\nher leaders in violation of treaties, agreements or assurances, were\r\nalso wars of aggression. A war of aggression is one which is resorted to\r\nin violation of the international obligation not to have recourse to war\r\nor, in cases in which war is not totally renounced, when it is resorted\r\nto in disregard of the duty to utilize the procedure of pacific\r\nsettlement which a State has bound itself to observe. There was indeed,\r\nin the period between the two World Wars, a divergence of view among\r\njurists and statesmen whether it was preferable to attempt in advance a\r\nlegal definition of aggression or to leave to the States concerned and\r\nto the collective organs of the international community freedom of\r\nappreciation of the facts in any particular situation that might arise.\r\nThose holding the latter view urged that a rigid definition might be\r\nabused by an unscrupulous State to fit in with its aggressive design;\r\nthey feared, and the British Government was for a time among those who\r\nthought so, that an automatic definition of aggression might become “a\r\ntrap for the innocent and sign-post for the guilty”. Others held that in\r\nthe interest of certainty and security a definition of aggression, like\r\na definition of any crime in municipal law, was proper and useful; they\r\nurged that the competent international organs, political and judicial,\r\ncould be trusted to avoid any particular case a definition of aggression\r\nwhich might lead to obstruction or to an absurdity. In May 1933 the\r\nCommittee on Security Questions of the Disarmament Conference proposed a\r\ndefinition of aggression on the following lines:\r\n\r\n    “The aggressor in an international conflict shall, subject to\r\n    the agreements in force between the parties to the dispute, be\r\n    considered to be that State which is the first to commit any of\r\n    the following actions:\r\n\r\n    “(1)  declaration of war upon another state;\r\n\r\n    “(2)  invasion by its armed forces, with or without a\r\n    declaration of war, of the territory of another State;\r\n\r\n    “(3)  attack by its land, naval, or air forces, with or without\r\n    a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels, or aircraft of\r\n    another State;\r\n\r\n    “(4)  naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another State;\r\n\r\n    “(5)  provision of support to armed bands formed in its\r\n    territory which have invaded the territory of another State, or\r\n    refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded State, to\r\n    take in its own territory all the measures in its power to\r\n    deprive those bands of all assistance or protection.”\r\n\r\nThe various treaties concluded in 1933 by the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics and other States followed closely that definition. So did the\r\nDraft Convention submitted in 1933 by His Majesty’s Government in the\r\nUnited Kingdom to the Disarmament Conference.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is unprofitable to elaborate here the details of the problem\r\nor of the definition of aggression. This Tribunal will not allow itself\r\nto be deflected from its purpose by attempts to ventilate in this Court\r\nwhat is an academic and, in the circumstances, an utterly unreal\r\ncontroversy as to what is a war of aggression. There is no definition of\r\naggression, general or particular, which does not cover abundantly and\r\nirresistibly and in every material detail the premeditated onslaught by\r\nGermany upon the territorial integrity and the political independence of\r\nso many States.\r\n\r\nThis then being the law—that the peoples of the world by the Pact of\r\nParis had finally outlawed war and made it criminal—let us turn to the\r\nfacts and see how these Defendants under their Leader and with their\r\nassociates destroyed the high hopes of mankind and sought to revert to\r\ninternational anarchy. And first in general terms let this be said, for\r\nit will be established beyond doubt by the documents. From the moment\r\nHitler became Chancellor in 1933, with the Defendant Von Papen as\r\nVice-Chancellor, and with the Defendant Von Neurath as his Foreign\r\nMinister, the whole atmosphere of the world darkened. The hopes of the\r\npeople began to recede. Treaties seemed no longer matters of solemn\r\nobligation, but were entered into with complete cynicism as a means for\r\ndeceiving other States of Germany’s warlike intentions. International\r\nConferences were no longer to be used as a means for securing pacific\r\nsettlements but as occasions for obtaining by blackmail demands which\r\nwere eventually to be enlarged by war. The World came to know the War of\r\nNerves, the diplomacy of the fait accompli, of blackmail and bullying.\r\n\r\nIn October 1933 Hitler told his Cabinet that as the proposed Disarmament\r\nConvention did not concede full equality to Germany, “It would be\r\nnecessary to torpedo the Disarmament Conference. It was out of the\r\nquestion to negotiate: Germany would leave the Conference and the\r\nLeague”. And on the 21st October 1933 she did so, and by so doing struck\r\na deadly blow at the fabric of security which had been built up on the\r\nbasis of the League Covenant. From that time on the record of their\r\nforeign policy became one of complete disregard of all international\r\nobligations and certainly not least of those solemnly concluded by\r\nthemselves. As Hitler had expressly avowed, “Agreements are kept only so\r\nlong as they serve a certain purpose” (_789-PS_). He might have added\r\nthat often the purpose was only to lull an intended victim into a false\r\nsense of security. So patent, indeed, did this eventually become that to\r\nbe invited by the Defendant Ribbentrop to enter into a nonaggression\r\npact with Germany was almost a sign that Germany intended to attack the\r\nstate concerned. Nor was it only the formal treaty which they used and\r\nviolated as circumstances made expedient. These Defendants are charged,\r\ntoo, with breaches of the less formal assurances which, in accordance\r\nwith diplomatic usage Germany gave to neighboring states. Today with the\r\nadvance of science the world has been afforded means of communication\r\nand intercourse hitherto unknown, and as Hitler himself expressly\r\nrecognized, International relations no longer depend upon treaties\r\nalone. The methods of diplomacy change. The Leader of one Nation can\r\nspeak to the Government and peoples of another. But though the methods\r\nchange the principles of good faith and honesty, established as the\r\nfundamentals of civilized society, both in the national and the\r\nInternational spheres, remain. It is a long time since it was said that\r\nwe are part, one of another. And if today the different states are more\r\nclosely connected and thus form part of a World Society more than ever\r\nbefore, so also more than ever before is there that need of good faith\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nLet us see further how these Defendants, Ministers and High Officers of\r\nthe Nazi Government individually and collectively comported themselves\r\nin these matters.\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\nIn the early hours of the 1st September 1939 under manufactured and, in\r\nany event, inadequate, pretexts, the armed Forces of the German Reich\r\ninvaded Poland along the whole length of her Frontiers and thus launched\r\nupon the world the war which was to bring down so many of the pillars of\r\nour civilization. It was a breach of the Hague Conventions (_TC-2_). It\r\nwas a breach of the Treaty of Versailles which had established the\r\nFrontiers between Germany and Poland. And however much Germany disliked\r\nthat Treaty—although Hitler had stated that he would respect its\r\nterritorial provisions—she was certainly not free to break it by\r\nunilateral action. It was a breach of the Arbitration Treaty between\r\nGermany and Poland concluded at Locarno on 16th October 1925 (_TC-15_).\r\nBy that Treaty Germany and Poland expressly agreed to refer any matters\r\nof dispute not capable of settlement by ordinary diplomatic machinery to\r\nthe decision of an Arbitral Tribunal or of the Permanent Court of\r\nInternational Justice. But that is not all. It was also a breach of a\r\nmore recent and, in view of the repeated emphasis laid on it by Hitler\r\nhimself, a more important engagement into which Nazi Germany had\r\nentered. On the 26th January 1934 the German and Polish Governments had\r\nsigned a ten-year Pact of Non-aggression (_TC-21_). It was, as the\r\nsignatories stated, to introduce “a new era in the political relations\r\nbetween Poland and Germany”. It was stated in the text of the Pact\r\nitself that “the maintenance and guarantee of lasting Peace between the\r\ntwo countries is an essential prerequisite for the general peace of\r\nEurope”. The two Governments therefore agreed to base their mutual\r\nrelations on the principles laid down in the Pact of Paris of 1928. They\r\ndeclared that\r\n\r\n    “In no circumstances * * * will they proceed to the application\r\n    of force for the purpose of reaching a decision in such\r\n    disputes”. (_TC-21_)\r\n\r\nThat declaration and agreement was to remain in force for at least ten\r\nyears and thereafter would remain valid unless it was denounced by\r\neither Government six months before the expiration of the ten years, or\r\nsubsequently a denunciation, with six months notice took place.\r\n\r\nBoth at the time of its signature and during the following four years\r\nHitler spoke of the German-Polish Agreement publicly as though it were a\r\ncornerstone of his foreign policy. By entering into it he persuaded many\r\npeople that his intentions were genuinely pacific, for the re-emergence\r\nof an independent Poland had cost Germany much territory and had\r\nseparated East Prussia from the Reich. That Hitler should of his own\r\naccord enter into friendly relations with Poland; that in his speeches\r\non foreign policy he should proclaim his recognition of Poland’s right\r\nto an exit to the sea, and the necessity for Germans and Poles to live\r\nside by side in amity—these facts seemed to the world convincing proof\r\nthat Hitler had no “revisionist” aims which would threaten the peace of\r\nEurope, and that he was even genuinely anxious to put an end to the\r\nage-old hostility between the Teuton and the Slav. If his professions\r\nwere genuine his policy excluded a renewal of the _Drang nach Osten_ and\r\nthereby would contribute to the stability of Europe. We shall have\r\noccasion enough to see how little truth these pacific professions\r\ncontained. The history of the fateful years from 1934 to 1939 shows\r\nquite clearly that the Germans used this Treaty, as they used other\r\nTreaties, merely as an instrument of policy for furthering their\r\naggressive aims. It is clear from the documents now presented to the\r\nTribunal that these five years fall into two distinct phases in the\r\nrealization of aggressive aims which always underlay the Nazi policy.\r\nThere was first the period from the Nazi assumption of power in 1933\r\nuntil the autumn of 1937. That was the preparatory period. During that\r\ntime there occurred the breaches of the Versailles and Locarno Treaties,\r\nthe feverish rearmament of Germany, the reintroduction of conscription,\r\nthe reoccupation and remilitarization of the Rhineland, and all the\r\nother necessary preparatory measures for future aggression with which my\r\nUnited States colleagues have already so admirably dealt. During that\r\ntime they lulled Poland into a false sense of security. Not only Hitler,\r\nbut also the Defendant Goering and the Defendant Ribbentrop made\r\nstatements approbating the Pact. In 1935 Goering was saying that “the\r\npact was not planned for a period of ten years but forever: there need\r\nnot be the slightest fear that it would not be continued.” Even though\r\nGermany was steadily building up the greatest war machine that Europe\r\nhad ever known, and although, by January 1937, the German military\r\nposition was so secure that Hitler could refer openly to his strong\r\nArmy, he took pains also to say at the time that “by a series of\r\nagreements we have eliminated existing tensions and thereby contributed\r\nconsiderably to an improvement in the European atmosphere. I merely\r\nrecall the agreement with Poland which has worked out to the advantage\r\nof both sides. * * *” (_2368-PS_). And so it went on—abroad\r\nprotestations of pacific intentions—at home “guns before butter”.\r\n\r\nIn 1937, however, this preparatory period drew to a close and Nazi\r\npolicy moved from general preparation for future aggression to specific\r\nplanning for the attainment of certain specific aggressive aims. Two\r\ndocuments in particular mark this change.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was an important “Directive for unified preparation\r\nfor War” issued on June 29, 1937, by the Reich-Minister for War (von\r\nBlomberg) and C-in-C of the Armed Forces (_C-175_). This document is\r\nimportant, not only for its military directions, but for the\r\nappreciation it contained of the European situation and for the\r\nrevelation it provides of the Nazi attitude towards it.\r\n\r\n    “The general political position”, von Blomberg stated,\r\n    “justifies the supposition that Germany need not consider an\r\n    attack from any side. Grounds for this are, in addition to the\r\n    lack of desire for war in almost all Nations, particularly the\r\n    Western Powers, the deficiencies in the preparedness for war of\r\n    a number of States, and of Russia in particular”. (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nHe added, it is true, “The intention of unleashing an European War is\r\nheld just as little by Germany”. And it may be that that phrase was\r\ncarefully chosen, for Germany hoped to conquer the world in detail: to\r\nfight on one front at a time, not to unleash a general European\r\nconflict. But, he went on, “the politically fluid world situation, which\r\ndoes not preclude surprising incidents, demands a continuous\r\npreparedness for war of the German Armed Forces (_a_) to counter attack\r\nat any time (yet he had just said that there was no fear of any attack)\r\nand (_b_) to enable the military exploitation of politically favorable\r\nopportunities should they occur”. That phrase is no more than a\r\neuphemistic description of aggressive war. It reveals the continued\r\nadherence of the German military leaders to the doctrine that military\r\nmight, and if necessary war, should be an instrument of policy—the\r\ndoctrine explicitly condemned by the Kellogg Pact, to which Germany had\r\nadhered. The document goes on to set out the general preparations\r\nnecessary for a possible war in the mobilization period 1937/1938. The\r\ndocument is evidence at least for this—that the leaders of the German\r\nArmed Forces had it in mind to use the military strength which they were\r\nbuilding up for aggressive purposes. “No reason”—they say—“to\r\nanticipate attack from any side * * * there is a lack of desire for\r\nwar”. Yet they prepare to “exploit militarily favorable opportunities”.\r\n\r\nStill more important as evidence of the transition to planned aggression\r\nis the record of the important conference which Hitler held at the\r\nReichs Chancellery on November 5, 1937, at which von Blomberg, Reich\r\nMinister for War, von Fritsch, C-in-C of the Army, Goering, C-in-C of\r\nthe Luftwaffe, Raeder, C-in-C of the Navy and von Neurath, then the\r\nReich Minister for Foreign Affairs, were present. The minutes of that\r\nconference have already been put in evidence (_386-PS_). I refer to them\r\nnow to emphasize those passages which make apparent the ultimate\r\nintention to wage an aggressive war. As will be remembered, the burden\r\nof Hitler’s argument at that conference was that Germany required more\r\nterritory in Europe. Austria and Czechoslovakia were specifically\r\nenvisaged. But Hitler realized that the process of conquering these two\r\ncountries might well bring into operation the treaty obligations of\r\nGreat Britain and France. He was prepared to take the risk.\r\n\r\n    “The history of all times: Roman Empire, British Empire, has\r\n    proved that every space expansion can only be effected by\r\n    breaking resistance and taking risks. Even setbacks are\r\n    unavoidable: neither formerly nor today has space been found\r\n    without an owner. The attacker always comes up against the\r\n    proprietor. The question for Germany is where the greatest\r\n    possible conquest can be made at the lowest possible cost”.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his address to that Conference Hitler had foreseen and\r\ndiscussed the likelihood that Poland would be involved if the aggressive\r\nexpansionist aims which he put forward brought about a general European\r\nwar in the course of their realization by Germany. When, therefore, on\r\nthat very day Hitler assured the Polish Ambassador of the value of the\r\n1934 Pact it can only be concluded that its real value in Hitler’s eyes\r\nwas that of keeping Poland quiet until Germany had acquired such a\r\nterritorial and strategic position that Poland would no longer be a\r\ndanger to her.\r\n\r\nThat view is confirmed by the events which followed. At the beginning of\r\nFebruary 1938 the change from Nazi preparation for aggression to active\r\naggression itself took place. It was marked by the substitution of\r\nRibbentrop for Neurath as Foreign Minister, and of Keitel for Blomberg\r\nas head of OKW. Its first fruits were the bullying of Schuschnigg at\r\nBerchtesgaden on February 12, 1938, and the forcible absorption of\r\nAustria in March. Thereafter the Green Plan (_Fall Gruen_) for the\r\ndestruction of Czechoslovakia was steadily developed—the plan partially\r\nfoiled, or of which the final consummation was at least delayed, by the\r\nMunich Agreement.\r\n\r\nWith these developments of Nazi aggression my United States colleagues\r\nhave already dealt. But it is obvious that the acquisition of these two\r\ncountries, and of their resources in manpower and in the production of\r\nmunitions of war, immensely strengthened the position of Germany as\r\nagainst Poland. It is, therefore, not surprising that, just as the\r\ndefendant Goering assured the Czechoslovak Minister in Berlin, at the\r\ntime of the Nazi invasion of Austria that Hitler recognized the validity\r\nof the German-Czechoslovak Arbitration Treaty of 1925, and that Germany\r\nhad no designs against Czechoslovakia herself—“I give you my word of\r\nhonor” said Goering—so also continued assurances should be given during\r\n1938 to Poland in order to keep that country from interfering with the\r\nNazi aggression on Poland’s neighbors.\r\n\r\nThus, on the 20th February 1938 on the eve of his invasion of Austria,\r\nHitler, referring to the fourth anniversary of the Polish Pact,\r\npermitted himself to say this to the Reichstag:\r\n\r\n    “* * * and so a way to a friendly understanding has been\r\n    successfully paved, an understanding which beginning with Danzig\r\n    has today succeeded in finally taking the poison out of the\r\n    relations between Germany and Poland and transforming them into\r\n    a sincere friendly cooperation. Relying on her friendships,\r\n    Germany will not leave a stone unturned to save that ideal which\r\n    provides the foundation for the task ahead of us—Peace”.\r\n    (_2357-PS_)\r\n\r\nStill more striking are the cordial references to Poland in Hitler’s\r\nspeech in the Sportpalast at Berlin on the 26 September 1938. He then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “The most difficult problem with which I was confronted was that\r\n    of our relations with Poland. There was a danger that Poles and\r\n    Germans would regard each other as hereditary enemies. I wanted\r\n    to prevent this. I know well enough that I should not have been\r\n    successful if Poland had had a democratic constitution. For\r\n    these democracies which indulge in phrases about peace are the\r\n    most bloodthirsty war agitators. In Poland there ruled no\r\n    democracy, but a man: and with him I succeeded, in precisely\r\n    twelve months, in coming to an agreement which, for ten years in\r\n    the first instance, entirely removed the danger of a conflict.\r\n    We are all convinced that this agreement will bring lasting\r\n    pacification. We realize that here are two peoples which must\r\n    live together and neither of which can do away with the other. A\r\n    people of 33 millions will always strive for an outlet to the\r\n    sea. A way for understanding, then, had to be found, and it will\r\n    be ever further extended. Certainly things were hard in this\r\n    area. * * * But the main fact is that the two Governments, and\r\n    all reasonable and clear-sighted persons among the two peoples\r\n    and in the two countries, possess the firm will and\r\n    determination to improve their relations. It was a real work of\r\n    peace, of more worth than all the chattering in the League of\r\n    Nations Palace at Geneva”.\r\n\r\nThus flattery of Poland preceded the annexation of Austria and renewed\r\nflattery of Poland preceded the projected annexation of Czechoslovakia.\r\nThe realities behind these outward expressions of goodwill are clearly\r\nrevealed in the documents relating to _Fall Gruen_, which are already\r\nbefore the Tribunal. They show Hitler as fully aware that there was risk\r\nof Poland, England and France being involved in war to prevent the\r\nGerman annexation of Czechoslovakia, and that this risk though realized\r\nwas also accepted. On the 25th August top secret orders to the German\r\nAir Force in regard to the operations to be conducted against England\r\nand France if they intervened pointed out that, as the\r\nFrench-Czechoslovak Treaty provided for assistance only in the case of\r\n“unprovoked” attack, it would take a day or two for France and England\r\nto decide whether legally the attack was unprovoked or not. A blitzkrieg\r\naccomplishing its aims before effective intervention became possible was\r\nthe object to be aimed at.\r\n\r\nOn the same day an Air Force memorandum on future organization was\r\nissued to which was attached a map on which the Baltic States, Hungary,\r\nCzechoslovakia and Poland are all shown as part of Germany and\r\npreparations for expanding the Air Force “as the Reich grows in area”,\r\nas well as dispositions for a two-front war against France and Russia\r\nare discussed (_L-43_; _Chart No. 10_). And on the following day von\r\nRibbentrop is being minuted about the reaction of Poland towards the\r\nCzechoslovak problem:\r\n\r\n    “The fact that after the liquidation of the Czech question it\r\n    will be generally assumed that Poland will be next in turn” is\r\n    recognized but, it is stated, “the later this assumption sinks\r\n    in, the better”. (_TC-76_)\r\n\r\nI will pause at the date of the Munich Agreement for a moment and ask\r\nthe Tribunal to consider what the evidence of documents and historical\r\nfacts shows up to that time. It has made undeniable the fact both of\r\nNazi aggressiveness and of active aggression. Not only does the\r\nConference of 1937 reveal Hitler and his associates deliberately\r\nconsidering the acquisition of Austria and Czechoslovakia, if necessary\r\nby war, but the first of those operations had been carried through in\r\nMarch 1938 and a large part of the second, under threat of war, though\r\nwithout actual need for its initiation, in September of the same year.\r\nMore ominous still, Hitler had revealed his adherence to his old\r\ndoctrines of _Mein Kampf_, those essentially aggressive to the\r\nexposition of which in _Mein Kampf_ long regarded as the Bible of the\r\nNazi Party we shall draw attention. He is in pursuit of _Lebensraum_ and\r\nhe means to secure it by threats of force or, if they fail, by force, by\r\naggressive war.\r\n\r\nSo far actual warfare has been avoided because of the love of peace, the\r\nlack of preparedness, the patience or the cowardice—which you will—of\r\nthe democratic Powers. But, after Munich, the questions which filled the\r\nminds of all thinking people with acute anxiety was, “Where will this\r\nend? Is Hitler now satisfied, as he declares he is? Or will his pursuit\r\nof _Lebensraum_ lead to further aggressions, even if he has to make an\r\nopenly aggressive war to secure it?”\r\n\r\nIt was in relation to the remainder of Czechoslovakia and to Poland that\r\nthe answer to these questions was to be given. So far no direct and\r\nimmediate threat to Poland had been made. The two documents from which I\r\nhave just quoted (_L-43_; _TC-76_) show that high officers of the\r\ndefendant Goering’s Air Staff already regarded the extension of the\r\nReich and, it would appear, the destruction and absorption of Poland as\r\na foregone conclusion. They were already anticipating, indeed, the last\r\nstage of Hitler’s policy stated in _Mein Kampf_, war to destroy France\r\nand to secure _Lebensraum_ in Russia. And the writer of the Minute to\r\nRibbentrop already took it for granted that, after Czechoslovakia,\r\nPoland would be attacked. More impressive than these two documents is\r\nthe fact that, as I have said, the record of the Conference of November\r\n5, 1937, shows that war with Poland, if she should dare to attempt to\r\nprevent German aggression against Czechoslovakia, had been coolly\r\ncontemplated and that the Nazi leaders were ready to take the risk. So\r\nalso had the risk of war with England and France under the same\r\ncircumstances been considered and accepted. Such a war would, of course,\r\nhave been an aggressive war on Nazi Germany’s part. For to force one\r\nState to take up arms to defend another against aggression in order to\r\nfulfill treaty obligations is to initiate aggressive war against the\r\nfirst State.\r\n\r\nYet it remains true that until Munich the decision for direct attack\r\nupon Poland and her destruction by aggressive war had apparently not as\r\nyet been taken by Hitler and his associates. It is to the transition\r\nfrom the intention and preparation of initiating an aggressive war,\r\nevident in regard to Czechoslovakia, to the actual initiation and waging\r\nof aggressive war against Poland that I now pass. That transition\r\noccupies the eleven months from October 1, 1938 to the actual attack on\r\nPoland on September 1, 1939.\r\n\r\nWithin six months of the signature of the Munich Agreement the Nazi\r\nLeaders had occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia, which by that\r\nagreement they had indicated their willingness to guarantee. On March\r\n14th, 1939, the aged and infirm President of the “Rump” of\r\nCzechoslovakia, Hacha, and his Foreign Minister, Chvalkowsky, were\r\nsummoned to Berlin. At a meeting held between 1.15 and 2.15 a. m. in the\r\nsmall hours of the 15th March in the presence of Hitler and the\r\ndefendants Ribbentrop, Goering, and Keitel, they were bullied and\r\nthreatened and informed bluntly that Hitler “had issued the order for\r\nthe German troops to march into Czechoslovakia, and for the\r\nincorporation of this country into the German Reich”. It was made quite\r\nclear to them that resistance would be useless and would be crushed “by\r\nforce of arms with all available means”. It was thus that the\r\nProtectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was set up and that Slovakia was\r\nturned into a German satellite, though nominally independent, state. By\r\ntheir own unilateral action, on pretexts which had no shadow of\r\nvalidity, without discussion with the Governments of any other country,\r\nwithout mediation and in direct contradiction of the sense and spirit of\r\nthe Munich Agreement, the Germans acquired for themselves that for which\r\nthey had been planning in September of the previous year, and indeed\r\nmuch earlier, but which at that time they had felt themselves unable\r\ncompletely to secure without too patent an exhibition of their\r\naggressive intentions. Aggression achieved whetted the appetite for\r\naggression to come. There were protests. England and France sent\r\ndiplomatic notes. Of course there were protests. The Nazis had clearly\r\nshown their hand. Hitherto they had concealed from the outside world\r\nthat their claims went beyond incorporating into the Reich persons of\r\nGerman Race living in bordering territory. Now for the first time, in\r\ndefiance of their own solemn assurances to the contrary, non-German\r\nterritory had been seized. This acquisition of the whole of\r\nCzechoslovakia, together with the equally illegal occupation of Memel on\r\nthe 22d March, resulted in an immense strengthening of the German\r\nposition, both politically and strategically, as Hitler had anticipated\r\nit would when he discussed the matter at his conference on November 5th,\r\n1937. (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nLong before the consummation by the Nazi Leaders of their aggression\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia, however, they had already begun to make demands\r\nupon Poland. On October 25th, 1938, that is to say within less than a\r\nmonth of Hitler’s reassuring speech about Poland already quoted and of\r\nthe Munich Agreement itself, M. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador in Berlin,\r\nreported to M. Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, that at a luncheon at\r\nBerchtesgaden the day before (October 24th) the defendant Ribbentrop had\r\nput forward demands for the reunion of Danzig with the Reich and for the\r\nbuilding of an extra-territorial motor road and railway line across\r\nPomorze, that is, the province which the Germans called the Corridor.\r\nFrom that moment onwards until the Polish Government had made it plain,\r\nduring a visit of the defendant Ribbentrop to Warsaw which ended on\r\nJanuary 27th, 1939, that they would not consent to hand over Danzig to\r\nGerman Sovereignty negotiations on these German demands continued. Even\r\nafter Ribbentrop’s return Hitler thought it worth while in his Reichstag\r\nSpeech on January 30th, 1939 to say—\r\n\r\n    “We have just celebrated the fifth anniversary of the conclusion\r\n    of our nonaggression pact with Poland. There can scarcely be any\r\n    difference of opinion today among the true friends of peace as\r\n    to the value of this agreement. One only needs to ask oneself\r\n    what might have happened to Europe if this agreement, which\r\n    brought such relief, had not been entered into five years ago.\r\n    In signing it, the great Polish marshal and patriot rendered his\r\n    people just as great a service as the leaders of the\r\n    National-Socialist State rendered the German people. During the\r\n    troubled months of the past year the friendship between Germany\r\n    and Poland has been one of the reassuring factors in the\r\n    political life of Europe”.\r\n\r\nThat utterance, however, was the last friendly word from Germany to\r\nPoland and the last occasion upon which the Nazi Leader mentioned the\r\nGerman-Polish Agreement with approbation. During February 1939 silence\r\nfell upon German demands. But as soon as the final absorption of\r\nCzechoslovakia had taken place, and Germany had also absorbed Memel,\r\nNazi pressure upon Poland was at once renewed. In two conversations\r\nbetween himself and the defendant Ribbentrop, held on March 21st and\r\nMarch 26th respectively (Polish White Book Number 61 and Number 63),\r\nGerman demands upon Poland were renewed and further pressed. In view of\r\nthe fate which had overtaken Czechoslovakia and of the grave\r\ndeterioration in her strategical position towards Germany it is not\r\nsurprising that the Polish Government took alarm at these developments.\r\nNor were they alone in this. The events of March 1939 had at last\r\nconvinced both the English and French Governments that the Nazi designs\r\nof aggression were not limited to men of German race and that the\r\nspectre of European war resulting from further aggressions by Nazi\r\nGermany had not been exorcised by the Munich Agreement.\r\n\r\nAs a result, therefore, of the concern of Poland, England, and France at\r\nthe events in Czechoslovakia and at the newly applied pressure on\r\nPoland, conversations between the English and Polish Governments had\r\nbeen taking place, and, on 31st March, 1939, Mr. Neville Chamberlain,\r\nspeaking in the House of Commons, stated that His Majesty’s Government\r\nhad given an assurance to help Poland in the event of any action which\r\nclearly threatened Polish independence and which the Polish Government\r\naccordingly considered it vital to resist (_TC-72, No. 17_). On 6th\r\nApril 1939 an Anglo-Polish communique stated that the two countries were\r\nprepared to enter into an Agreement of a permanent and reciprocal\r\ncharacter to replace the present temporary and unilateral assurance\r\ngiven by His Majesty’s Government. (_TC-72, No. 18_)\r\n\r\nThe justification for such concern is not difficult to find. With the\r\nevidence which we now have of what was happening within the councils of\r\nthe German Reich and its armed forces during these months it is manifest\r\nthat the German Government were intent on seizing Poland as a whole,\r\nthat Danzig—as Hitler was to say himself a month later—“was not the\r\nsubject of the dispute at all”. The Nazi Government was intent upon\r\naggression and the demands and negotiations in respect of Danzig were\r\nmerely a cover and excuse for further domination.\r\n\r\nAs far back as September 1938 plans for aggressive war against Poland,\r\nEngland, and France were well in hand. While Hitler, at Munich, was\r\ntelling the world that the German people wanted peace and that, having\r\nsolved the Czechoslovakian problem, Germany had no more territorial\r\nproblems in Europe, the staffs of his armed forces were already\r\npreparing plans. On the 26th September 1938 he had said:\r\n\r\n    “We have given guarantees to the States in the West. We have\r\n    assured all our immediate neighbours of the integrity of their\r\n    territory as far as Germany is concerned. That is no mere\r\n    phrase. It is our sacred will. We have no interest whatever in a\r\n    breach of the peace. We want nothing from these peoples.”\r\n\r\nThe world was entitled to rely upon these assurances. International\r\ncooperation is impossible unless one can assume good faith in the\r\nleaders of the various States. But within two months of that solemn and\r\nconsidered undertaking, Hitler and his confederates were preparing for\r\nthe seizure of Danzig. To recognize these assurances, these pledges,\r\nthese diplomatic moves as the empty frauds they were, one must go back\r\nto enquire what was happening within the inner councils of the Reich\r\nfrom the time of the Munich Agreement.\r\n\r\nWritten some time in September 1938 is an extract from a file on the\r\nReconstruction of the German Navy (_C-23_). Under the heading “Opinion\r\non the Draft Study of Naval Warfare against England” it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “1. If, according to the Fuehrer’s decision Germany is to\r\n    acquire a position as a world power, she needs not only\r\n    sufficient colonial possessions but also secure naval\r\n    communications and secure access to the ocean.\r\n\r\n    “2. Both requirements can only be fulfilled in opposition to\r\n    Anglo-French interests and would limit their position as world\r\n    powers. It is unlikely that they can be achieved by peaceful\r\n    means. The decision to make Germany a world power, therefore,\r\n    forces upon us the necessity of making the corresponding\r\n    preparations for war.\r\n\r\n    “3. War against England means at the same time war against the\r\n    Empire, against France, probably against Russia as well and a\r\n    large number of countries overseas, in fact, against half to\r\n    one-third of the world.\r\n\r\n    “It can only be justified and have a chance of success if it is\r\n    prepared economically as well as politically and militarily and\r\n    waged with the aim of conquering for Germany an outlet to the\r\n    ocean.” (_C-23_)\r\n\r\nHere is something which is both significant and new. Until this date the\r\ndocuments in our possession disclose preparations for war against\r\nPoland, England, and France purporting at least to be defensive measures\r\nto ward off attacks which might result from the intervention of those\r\npowers in the preparatory aggression of Germany in Central Europe.\r\nHitherto aggressive war against Poland, England, and France has been\r\ncontemplated only as a distant objective. Now, for the first time, we\r\nfind a war of conquest by Germany against France and England openly\r\nrecognized as the future aim, at least of the German Navy.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th November 1938 an Appendix was issued by Keitel to a previous\r\norder of the Fuehrer. In this Appendix there are set out the future\r\ntasks for the armed forces and the preparation for the conduct of the\r\nwar which would result from those tasks.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has ordered that besides the three eventualities\r\n    mentioned in the previous Directive preparations are also to be\r\n    made for the surprise occupation by German troops of the Free\r\n    State of Danzig.\r\n\r\n    “For the preparation the following principles are to be borne in\r\n    mind—the primary assumption is the lightning seizure of Danzig\r\n    by exploiting a favorable political situation and not war with\r\n    Poland * * *. Troops which are going to be used for this purpose\r\n    must not be held at the same time for the seizure of Memelland,\r\n    so that both operations can take place simultaneously should\r\n    such necessity arise.” (_C-137_)\r\n\r\nThereafter, as the evidence which has already been produced has shown,\r\nfinal preparations for the invasion of Poland were taking place. On the\r\n3d April 1939, three days before the issue of the Anglo-Polish\r\ncommunique, Keitel issued to the High Command of the Armed Forces a\r\nDirective in which it was stated that the Directive for the uniform\r\npreparation of war by the armed forces in 1939-40 was being re-issued,\r\nand that the part concerning Danzig would be issued in the middle of\r\nApril. The basic principles were to remain the same as in the previous\r\nDirective. Attached to this document were the orders “_Fall Weiss_”, the\r\ncode name for the proposed invasion of Poland. Preparations for that\r\ninvasion were to be made in such a way that the operation could be\r\ncarried out at any time from the 1st September 1939 onwards. (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th April Hitler issued his Directive for the uniform\r\npreparations of war by the armed forces 1939-40. In it he says:\r\n\r\n    “I shall lay down in a later Directive future tasks of the armed\r\n    forces and the preparations to be made in accordance with these\r\n    for the conduct of war. Until that Directive comes into force\r\n    the armed forces must be prepared for the following\r\n    eventualities:\r\n\r\n    “1. Safeguarding of the frontiers.\r\n\r\n    “2. _“Fall Weiss.”_\r\n\r\n    “3. The annexation of Danzig.”\r\n\r\nIn an Annex to that document headed “Political Hypotheses and Aims” it\r\nis stated that quarrels with Poland should be avoided. Should Poland,\r\nhowever, change her present policy and adopt a threatening attitude\r\ntowards Germany, a final settlement would be necessary, notwithstanding\r\nthe pact with Poland. The Free City of Danzig was to be incorporated\r\ninto Germany at the outbreak of the conflict at the latest. The policy\r\naims to limit the war to Poland and this is considered possible with the\r\ninternal crisis in France and resulting British restraint.\r\n\r\nThe wording of this document does not directly involve the intention of\r\nimmediate aggression. It is a plan of attack “if Poland changes her\r\npolicy and adopts a threatening attitude”. But the picture of Poland,\r\nwith her inadequate armaments, threatening Germany is ludicrous enough\r\nand the real aim emerges in the sentence “The aim is then to destroy\r\nPolish military strength and to create, in the East, a situation which\r\nsatisfies the requirements of defense”—a sufficiently vague phrase to\r\ncover designs of any magnitude. Even now the evidence does not suffice\r\nto prove that the actual decision to attack Poland has been taken. But\r\nall preparations are being set in train in case that decision is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nIt was within three weeks of the date of this last document that Hitler\r\naddressed the Reichstag (April 28th, 1939). In his speech he repeated\r\nthe German demands already made to Poland and proceeded to denounce the\r\nGerman-Polish Agreement of 1934. Leaving aside for the moment the\r\nwarlike preparations for aggression, which Hitler had set in train\r\nbehind the scenes, I will ask the Tribunal to consider the nature of the\r\ndenunciation of an Agreement to which, in the past, Hitler had professed\r\nto attach so high an importance.\r\n\r\nIn the first place Hitler’s denunciation was _per se_ ineffectual, since\r\nthe text of the Agreement made no provision for its denunciation by\r\neither Party until six months before the expiration of the ten years for\r\nwhich it was concluded. No denunciation could be legally affective,\r\ntherefore, until June or July 1943, and Hitler was speaking on April\r\n28th 1939—more than five years too soon!\r\n\r\nIn the second place Hitler’s actual attack on Poland when it came on\r\nSeptember 1st, 1939, was made before the expiration of the six months\r\nperiod after denunciation required by the Agreement before such a\r\ndenunciation became operative. In the third place the grounds for his\r\ndenunciation of the Agreement stated by Hitler in his speech to the\r\nReichstag are entirely specious. However one reads its terms it is\r\nimpossible to accept the view that the Anglo-Polish guarantee of mutual\r\nassistance against aggression could render the Pact null and void. If\r\nthat were so then certainly the Pacts already entered into by Hitler\r\nwith Italy and Japan had already invalidated it, and Hitler might have\r\nspared his breath. But the truth is that the text of the German-Polish\r\nAgreement contains nothing whatever to support Hitler’s contention.\r\n\r\nWhy then did Hitler make this trebly invalid attempt to denounce his own\r\npet diplomatic child? Is there any other possible answer but that, the\r\nAgreement having served its purpose, the grounds which he put forward\r\nwere chosen merely in an effort to provide Germany with some\r\njustification for the aggression on which she was intent.\r\n\r\nFor Hitler sorely needed some kind of justification, some apparently\r\ndecent excuse, since nothing had happened, or was likely to happen, from\r\nthe Polish side to provide him with it. So far he had made demands upon\r\nhis Treaty partner which Poland, as a sovereign State had every right to\r\nrefuse. If dissatisfied with that refusal Hitler was bound, under the\r\nterms of the Agreement itself, to “seek a settlement through other\r\npeaceful means, without prejudice to the possibility of applying those\r\nmethods of procedure, in case of necessity, which are provided for such\r\na case in the other agreements between them that are in force”—a\r\nreference, it can only be supposed, to the German-Polish Arbitration\r\nTreaty signed at Locarno in 1925.\r\n\r\nThe very fact, therefore, that as soon as the Nazi leader cannot get\r\nwhat he wants, but is not entitled to, from Poland by merely asking for\r\nit, and that, on his side, he made no further effort to settle the\r\ndispute “by peaceful means” in accordance with the terms of the\r\nAgreement and of the Kellogg Pact, to which the Agreement pledged both\r\nParties, in itself creates a strong presumption of aggressive intentions\r\nagainst Hitler and his associates. That presumption becomes a certainty\r\nwhen the documents to which I shall now refer are studied.\r\n\r\nOn 10th May Hitler issued an order for the capture of economic\r\ninstallations in Poland and on 16th May the Defendant Raeder, as\r\nCommander in Chief of the Navy, issued a memorandum setting out the\r\nFuehrer’s instructions to prepare for the operation “Fall Weiss” at any\r\ntime from the 1st September 1939. (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nBut the decisive document is the record of the Conference held by Hitler\r\non May 23d, 1939 with various high-ranking officers, including the\r\ndefendants Goering, Raeder, and Keitel. Hitler then stated that the\r\nsolution of the economic problems could not be found without invasion of\r\nforeign States and attacks on foreign property.\r\n\r\n    “Danzig is not the subject of the dispute at all: it is a\r\n    question of expanding our living space in the East * * *. There\r\n    is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and we are left with\r\n    the decision: to attack Poland at the earliest opportunity. We\r\n    cannot expect a repetition of the Czech affair. There will be\r\n    war. Our task is to isolate Poland. The success of this\r\n    isolation will be decisive. The isolation of Poland is a matter\r\n    of skillful politics.” (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nHe anticipated the possibility that war with England and France might\r\nresult. But a two-front war was to be avoided if possible. Yet England\r\nwas recognized as the most dangerous enemy. “England is the driving\r\nforce against Germany * * * the aim will always be to force England to\r\nher knees.” More than once he repeated that the war with England and\r\nFrance would be a life and death struggle. All the same, he concluded,\r\n“We shall not be forced into war but we shall not be able to avoid one.”\r\n\r\nOn the 14th June, 1939, General Blaskowitz, then Commander in Chief of\r\nthe 3d Army Group, issued a detailed battle plan for the “_Fall Weiss_”\r\n(_2327-PS_). The following day Von Brauchitsch issued a memorandum in\r\nwhich it was stated that the object of the impending operating was to\r\ndestroy the Polish Armed Forces. “High Policy demands”—he said—“that\r\nthe war should be begun by heavy surprise blows in order to achieve\r\nquick results (_C-126_). The preparations proceeded apace. On the 22d\r\nJune Keitel submitted a preliminary timetable for the operation which\r\nHitler seems to have approved and suggested that the scheduled manouevre\r\nmust be camouflaged “in order not to disquiet the population”. On the 3d\r\nJuly Brauchitsch wrote to Raeder urging that certain preliminary naval\r\nmoves should be abandoned in order not to prejudice the surprise of the\r\nattack. On the 12th and 13th August Hitler and Ribbentrop had a\r\nconference with Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the conversation Hitler emphasized the strength of\r\nthe German position, of its western and eastern fortifications and of\r\nthe strategic and other advantages that they held in comparison with\r\nthose of England, France, and Poland.\r\n\r\n    “Since the Poles through their whole attitude had made it clear\r\n    that in any case in the event of a conflict they would stand on\r\n    the side of the enemies of Germany and Italy, a quick\r\n    liquidation at the present moment could only be of advantage for\r\n    the unavoidable conflict with the Western democracies. If a\r\n    hostile Poland remained on Germany’s Eastern frontier, not only\r\n    would the eleven East Prussian divisions be tied down, but also\r\n    further contingents would be kept in Pomerania and Silesia. This\r\n    would not be necessary in the event of a previous liquidation.\r\n    Generally speaking, the best thing to happen would be for the\r\n    neutrals to be liquidated one after the other. This process\r\n    could be carried out more easily if on every occasion one\r\n    partner of the Axis covered the other while it was dealing with\r\n    an uncertain neutral. Italy might well regard Yugoslavia as a\r\n    neutral of this kind.”\r\n\r\nCiano was for postponing the operation. Italy was not ready—she\r\nbelieved that a conflict with Poland would develop into a general\r\nEuropean war. Mussolini was convinced that conflict with the Western\r\ndemocracies was inevitable but he was making plans for a period two or\r\nthree years ahead. But the Fuehrer said that the Danzig question must be\r\nsettled one way or the other by the end of August. “He had, therefore,\r\ndecided to use the occasion of the next Polish provocation in the form\r\nof an ultimatum.” On the 22d August Hitler called his Supreme Commanders\r\ntogether at Obersalzburg and gave the order for the attack: in the\r\ncourse of what he said he made it clear that the decision to attack had\r\nin fact been made not later than the previous spring. He would give a\r\nspurious cause for starting the war (_1014-PS_; _L-3_). At that time the\r\nattack was timed for the early hours of the 26th August. On the day\r\nbefore the British Government, in the hope that Hitler might still be\r\nreluctant to plunge the world into war, and in the belief that a formal\r\ntreaty would impress him more than the informal assurances which had\r\nbeen given previously, entered into an agreement for mutual assistance\r\nwith Poland, embodying the previous assurances. It was known to Hitler\r\nthat France was bound by the Franco-Polish Treaty of 1921, and by the\r\nGuarantee Pact signed at Locarno in 1925 to intervene in Poland’s aid in\r\ncase of aggression. For a moment Hitler hesitated. Goering and\r\nRibbentrop agree that it was this Anglo-Polish Treaty which led him to\r\ncall off, or rather postpone the attack. Perhaps he hoped that there was\r\nstill some chance of repeating, after all, what he had called the Czech\r\naffair. If so, his hopes were short-lived.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th August Hitler accepted Mussolini’s decision not at once to\r\ncome into the war, but asked for propaganda support and a display of\r\nmilitary activities to create uncertainty in the minds of the Allies.\r\nRibbentrop on the same day said that the Armies were marching.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, of course, and particularly in the last month,\r\ndesperate attempts had been made by the Western Powers to avert war. You\r\nwill have details of them in evidence. Of the intervention of the Pope.\r\nOf President Roosevelt’s message. Of the offer by Mr. Chamberlain to do\r\nour utmost to create the conditions in which all matters in issue could\r\nbe the subject of free negotiations and to guarantee the resultant\r\ndecisions. This and all the other efforts of honest men to avoid the\r\nhorror of a European war were predestined to failure. The Germans were\r\ndetermined that the day for war had come. On the 31st August Hitler\r\nissued a top secret order for the attack to commence in the early hours\r\nof the 1st September. The necessary frontier incidents duly\r\noccurred—was it for these that Keitel had been instructed by Hitler to\r\nsupply Heydrich with Polish uniforms?—and thus, without a declaration\r\nof war, without even giving the Polish Government an opportunity of\r\nseeing Germany’s final demands the Nazi troops invaded Poland. On the 3d\r\nSeptember, Hitler sent a telegram to Mussolini thanking him for his\r\nintervention but pointing out that the war was inevitable and that the\r\nmost promising moment had to be picked after cold deliberation\r\n(_1831-PS_). And so Hitler and his Confederates now before this Tribunal\r\nbegan the first of their wars of aggression for which they had prepared\r\nso long and so thoroughly. They waged it so fiercely that within a few\r\nweeks Poland was overrun.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d November 1939 Hitler reviewed the situation to his military\r\nCommanders and in the course of his speech he said this:\r\n\r\n    “One year later Austria came; this step was also considered\r\n    doubtful. It brought about a tremendous reinforcement of the\r\n    Reich. The next step was Bohemia, Moravia, and Poland. This step\r\n    also was not possible to accomplish in one campaign. First of\r\n    all the Western fortifications had to be finished * * *. Then\r\n    followed the creation of the Protectorate and with that the\r\n    basis of action against Poland was laid. But I wasn’t quite\r\n    clear at that time whether I should start first against the East\r\n    and then in the West or vice versa. The decision came to fight\r\n    with Poland first. One might accuse me of wanting to fight again\r\n    and again. In struggle, I see the fate of all human beings.”\r\n    (_789-PS_)\r\n\r\nHe was not sure when to attack first. But that sooner or later he would\r\nattack was never in doubt, and he had been warned not only by the\r\nBritish and French Prime Ministers but even by his confederate Mussolini\r\nthat an attack on Poland would bring England and France into the war. He\r\nchose what he considered the opportune moment—and he struck.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the intent to wage war against England and\r\nFrance, and to precipitate it by an attack on Poland, is not to be\r\ndenied. Here was defiance of the most solemn treaty obligations: here\r\nwas neglect of the most pacific assurances. Here was aggression, naked\r\nand unashamed, which was indeed to arouse the horrified and heroic\r\nresistance of all civilized peoples but which was to tear down many of\r\nthe pillars of our civilization.\r\n\r\nOnce started upon the active achievement of their plan to secure the\r\ndomination of Europe, if not of the world, the Nazi Government proceeded\r\nto attack other countries, as occasion offered. The first actually to be\r\ninvaded after the attack on Poland were Denmark and Norway.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th April 1940 the German Armed Forces invaded Norway and Denmark\r\nwithout warning, without any declaration of war. It was a breach of the\r\nHague Convention of 1907. It was a breach of the Convention of\r\nArbitration and Conciliation between Germany and Denmark dated 2d June,\r\n1926. It was, of course, a breach of the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928. It\r\nwas a violation of the Nonaggression Treaty between Germany and Denmark\r\nmade on the 31st May 1939. And it was a breach of the most explicit\r\nassurances which had been given. After his annexation of Czechoslovakia\r\nhad shaken the confidence of the world, Hitler attempted to reassure the\r\nScandinavian States. On the 28th April, 1939, he affirmed that he had\r\nnever made any request to them which was incompatible with their\r\nsovereignty and independence. On the 31st May, 1939, he signed a\r\nnonaggression Pact with Denmark.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d September, the day after he had invaded Poland and seized\r\nDanzig, he again expressed his determination to observe the\r\ninviolability and integrity of Norway in an aide memoire which was\r\nhanded to the Norwegian Foreign Minister by the German Minister in Oslo\r\non that day. (_TC-31_)\r\n\r\nA month later, on the 6th October 1939, he said in a public speech:\r\n\r\n    “Germany has never had any conflicts of interest or even points\r\n    of controversy with the Northern States, neither has she any\r\n    today. Sweden and Norway have both been offered nonaggression\r\n    pacts by Germany and have both refused them solely because they\r\n    do not feel themselves threatened in any way.”\r\n\r\nWhen the invasion of Norway and Denmark had already begun in the early\r\nmorning of the 9th April, a German memorandum was handed to the\r\nGovernments of those countries attempting to justify the German action.\r\nVarious allegations against the Governments of the invaded countries\r\nwere made. It was said that Norway had been guilty of breaches of\r\nneutrality. It was said that she had allowed and tolerated the use of\r\nher territorial waters by Great Britain. It was said that Britain and\r\nFrance were making plans themselves to invade and occupy Norway and that\r\nthe Government of that country was prepared to acquiesce in such an\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to argue the question whether or not those allegations\r\nwere true or false. That question is irrelevant to the issue before this\r\nCourt. Even if the allegations were true (and they were patently false),\r\nthey would afford no conceivable justification for the action of\r\ninvading without warning, without declaration of war and without any\r\nattempt at mediation or conciliation. Aggressive war is none the less\r\naggressive war because the State which wages it believes that other\r\nstates may take similar action. The rape of a nation is not justified\r\nbecause it is thought she may be raped by another. Nor even in\r\nself-defense are warlike measures justified except after all means of\r\nmediation have failed and force is actually being exercised against the\r\nState concerned.\r\n\r\nIn actual fact, with the evidence which we now possess it is clear that\r\nthe invasion of these countries was undertaken for quite different\r\npurposes, that it had been planned long before any question of breach of\r\nneutrality or occupation of Norway by England could ever have occurred.\r\nIt is clear also that the assurances repeated again and again throughout\r\nthe year 1939 were made for no other purpose than to lull suspicion in\r\nthose countries and to prevent them taking steps to resist the attack\r\nagainst them which was under active preparation.\r\n\r\nFor some years, Rosenberg, in his capacity of Chief of the Foreign\r\nAffairs Bureau (APA) of the NSDAP, had interested himself in the\r\npromotion of fifth column activities in Norway, and close relationship\r\nwas established with the “Nasjonal Samling”, a political group headed by\r\nthe now notorious traitor, Vidkun Quisling (_007-PS_). During the winter\r\nof 1938/39, APA was in contact with Quisling and later Quisling\r\nconferred with Hitler, Raeder, and Rosenberg. In August 1939 a special\r\n14 day course was held at the school of the office of Foreign Relations\r\nin Berlin for 25 followers whom Quisling had selected to attend. The\r\nplan was to send a number of selected and “reliable” men to Germany for\r\na brief military training in an isolated camp. These were to be area and\r\nlanguage specialists to German special troops who were taken to Oslo on\r\ncoal barges to undertake political action in Norway. The object was a\r\ncoup in which Quisling would seize his leading opponents in Norway,\r\nincluding the King, and prevent all military resistance from the\r\nbeginning. Simultaneously Germany was making military preparations. On\r\nthe 2d September, 1939; Hitler had assured Norway of his intention to\r\nrespect her neutrality, and on 6th October he said that the Scandinavian\r\nStates were not menaced in any way, yet on 3d October 1939 Raeder was\r\npointing out that the occupation of bases, if necessary by force, would\r\ngreatly improve the strategic and economic position (_1546-PS_). On the\r\n9th October Doenitz was recommending Trondheim as the main base with\r\nNarvik as an alternative base for fuel supplies. Rosenberg was reporting\r\nshortly afterwards on the possibility of a coup d’état by Quisling\r\nimmediately supported by German military and naval forces. On the 12th\r\nDecember 1939 Raeder advised Hitler, in the presence of Keitel and Jodl,\r\nthat if Hitler was favourably impressed by Quisling, OKW should prepare\r\nfor the occupation of Norway, if possible with Quisling’s assistance,\r\nbut if necessary entirely by force. Hitler agreed but there was a doubt\r\nwhether action should be taken against the Low Countries or Scandinavia\r\nfirst. Weather conditions delayed the march against the Low Countries.\r\nIn January instructions were given to the Germany Navy for the attack on\r\nNorway, and on March 1st, 1940, a Directive for the occupation was\r\nissued by Hitler. The general objective was not said to be to prevent\r\noccupation by English Forces but in vague and general terms to prevent\r\nBritish encroachment in Scandinavia and the Baltic and “to guarantee our\r\nore bases in Sweden and give our Navy and Air Force a wider start line\r\nagainst Britain.” But the Directive went on:\r\n\r\n    “* * * on principle we will do our utmost to make the operation\r\n    appear as a peaceful occupation the object of which is the\r\n    military protection of the Scandinavian States * * * it is\r\n    important that the Scandinavian States as well as the Western\r\n    opponents should be taken by surprise by our measures. * * * In\r\n    case the preparations for embarkation can no longer be kept\r\n    secret the leader and the troops will be deceived with\r\n    fictitious objectives.”\r\n\r\nThe form and success of the invasion are well known. In the early hours\r\nof the 9th April 7 cruisers, 14 destroyers, and several torpedo boats\r\nand other small craft carried advance elements of 6 divisions totalling\r\nabout 10,000 men, forced an entry and landed troops in the outer Oslo\r\nFjord, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, and Narvik. A small\r\nnumber of troops were also landed at Arendal and Egersund on the\r\nsouthern coast. In addition airborne troops were landed on aerodromes\r\nnear Oslo and Stavanger. The German attack came as a surprise and all\r\nthe invaded towns along the coast were captured according to plan with\r\nonly slight losses. Only the plan to capture the King and members of the\r\nGovernment and the Parliament failed. Brave as the resistance was that\r\nwas hurriedly organized throughout the country, nothing could be done in\r\nthe face of the long-planned surprise attack and on 10 June military\r\nresistance ceased. So was another act of aggression brought to\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly a month after the attack on Norway, on the 10th May 1940\r\nthe German Armed Forces, repeating what had been done 25 years before,\r\nstreamed into Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg according to\r\nplan—the plan that is, of invading without warning and without\r\ndeclaration of War.\r\n\r\nWhat was done was of course a breach of the Hague Convention of 1907,\r\nand is so charged. It was a violation of the Locarno Agreement and\r\nArbitration Convention with Belgium of 1925 which the Nazi Government\r\naffirmed in 1935, only illegally to repudiate it two years later. By\r\nthat agreement all questions incapable of settlement by ordinary\r\ndiplomatic means were to be settled by arbitration. You will see the\r\ncomprehensive terms of these agreements. It was a breach of the Treaty\r\nof Arbitration and Conciliation signed between Germany and the\r\nNetherlands on the 20th May 1926; it was a violation of the similar\r\nTreaty with Luxembourg on the 11th September 1929. It was a breach of\r\nthe Briand-Kellogg Pact. But those Treaties had not perhaps derived in\r\nthe minds of the Nazi Rulers of Germany any added sanctity from the fact\r\nthat they had been solemnly concluded by the Governments of pre-Nazi\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the specific assurances and undertakings which the Nazi\r\nRulers themselves gave to the States which lay in the way of their plans\r\nagainst France and England and which they always intended to attack. Not\r\nonce, not twice, but eleven times the clearest assurances were given to\r\nBelgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. On those assurances solemnly\r\nand formally expressed, those countries were entitled to rely. In\r\nrespect of their breach these Defendants are charged. On the 30th\r\nJanuary, 1937 Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “As for the rest, I have more than once expressed the desire and\r\n    the hope of entering into similar good and cordial relations\r\n    with our neighbours. Germany has, and here I repeat this\r\n    solemnly, given the assurance time and time again, that, for\r\n    instance, between her and France there cannot be any humanly\r\n    conceivable points of controversy. The German Government has\r\n    further given the assurance to Belgium and Holland that it is\r\n    prepared to recognize and to guarantee the inviolability and\r\n    neutrality of these territories.”\r\n\r\nAfter Hitler had remilitarized the Rhineland and had repudiated the\r\nLocarno Pact, England and France sought to reestablish the position of\r\nsecurity for Belgium which Hitler’s action had threatened. They,\r\ntherefore, themselves gave to Belgium on the 24th April 1937, a specific\r\nguarantee that they would maintain in respect of Belgium, undertakings\r\nof assistance which they had entered into with her both under the\r\nLocarno Pact and the Covenant of the League of Nations. On the 13th\r\nOctober 1937 the German Government also made a declaration assuring\r\nBelgium of its intention to recognize the inviolability and integrity of\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, convenient to deal with the remaining assurances as we\r\nreview the evidence which is available as to the preparations and\r\nintentions of the German Government prior to their invasion of Belgium\r\non the 10th May 1940.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Poland, as in the case of Norway and Denmark, so also\r\nhere the dates speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nAs early as August 1938 steps were being made to utilize the Low\r\nCountries as defense bases for decisive action in the West in the event\r\nof France and England opposing Germany in its aggression upon\r\nCzechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nIn an air force letter dated 25th August 1938 which deals with the\r\naction to be taken if England and France should interfere in the\r\noperation against Czechoslovakia, it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “It is not expected for the moment that other States will\r\n    intervene against Germany. The Dutch and the Belgian area\r\n    assumes in this connection much more importance for the\r\n    prevention of the war in Western Europe than during the world\r\n    war. This mainly is an advance base for the air war.” (_375-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the last paragraph of that order it is stated “Belgium and the\r\nNetherlands when in German hands represent an extraordinary advantage in\r\nthe prosecution of the air war against Great Britain as well as against\r\nFrance.” (_375-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat was in August 1938. Eight months later (on the 28th April 1939)\r\nHitler is declaring again, “I was pleased that a number of European\r\nstates availed themselves of this declaration by the German Government\r\nto express and emphasize their desire to have absolute neutrality.”\r\n\r\nA month later, on the 23d May, 1939, Hitler held the conference in the\r\nReich Chancellery, to which we have already referred. The Minutes of\r\nthat meeting report Hitler as saying:\r\n\r\n    “The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed\r\n    force. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored. If England\r\n    and France enter the war between Germany and Poland they will\r\n    support Holland and Belgium in their neutrality. * * *\r\n    Therefore, if England intends to intervene in the Polish war, we\r\n    must occupy Holland with lightning speed. We must aim at\r\n    securing new defense lines on Dutch soil up to the Zuyder Zee”.\r\n    (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nEven after that he was to give his solemn declarations that he would\r\nobserve Belgian neutrality. On the 26th August 1939 when the crisis in\r\nregard to Danzig and Poland was reaching its climax, declarations\r\nassuring the Governments concerned of the intention to respect their\r\nneutrality were handed by the German Ambassadors to the King of the\r\nBelgians, the Queen of the Netherlands, and to the Government of the\r\nGrand-Duchy of Luxembourg in the most solemn form. But to the Army—“If\r\nHolland and Belgium are successfully occupied and held”—it was said—“a\r\nsuccessful war against England will be secured.”\r\n\r\nOn the 1st September Poland was invaded, and two days later England and\r\nFrance came into the War against Germany in pursuance of the treaty\r\nobligation already referred to. On the 6th October Hitler renewed his\r\nassurances of friendship to Belgium and Holland. But on the 9th October,\r\nbefore any kind of accusation had been made by the German Government of\r\nbreaches of neutrality by Belgium, the Netherlands, or Luxembourg,\r\nHitler issued a directive for the conduct of the war.\r\n\r\nIn that directive he stated:\r\n\r\n    “1. If it becomes evident in the near future that England and\r\n    France acting under her leadership, are not disposed to end the\r\n    war, I am determined to take firm and offensive action without\r\n    letting much time elapse.\r\n\r\n    “2. A long waiting period results not only in the ending of the\r\n    advantage to the Western Powers, of Belgium and perhaps also of\r\n    Dutch neutrality, but also strengthens the military power of our\r\n    enemies to an increasing degree, causes confidence of the\r\n    neutrals in German final victory to wane, and does not help to\r\n    bring Italy to our aid as brothers-in-arms.\r\n\r\n    “3. I therefore issue the following orders for the further\r\n    conduct of military operations:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Preparations should be made for offensive action on the\r\n    Northern flank of the Western front crossing the area of\r\n    Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland. This attack must be carried out\r\n    as soon and as forcefully as possible.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) The object of this attack is to defeat as many strong\r\n    sections of the French Fighting Army as possible, and her ally\r\n    and partner in the fighting, and at the same time to acquire as\r\n    great an area of Holland, Belgium and Northern France as\r\n    possible, to use as a base offering good prospects for waging\r\n    aerial and sea warfare against England and to provide ample\r\n    coverage for the vital district of the Ruhr.”\r\n\r\nNothing could state more clearly or more definitely the object behind\r\nthe invasion of these countries than that document.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th October 1939 Keitel wrote a most secret letter concerning\r\n_Fall Gelb_, which was the code name for the operation against the Low\r\nCountries. In it he stated:\r\n\r\n    “The protection of the Ruhr area by moving A/C reporting service\r\n    and the air defense as far forward as possible in the area of\r\n    Holland is significant for the whole conduct of the war. The\r\n    more Dutch territory we occupy the more effective can the\r\n    defense of the Ruhr area be made. This point of view must\r\n    determine the choice of objectives of the army even if the army\r\n    and navy are not directly interested in such territorial gain.\r\n    It must be the object of the army’s preparations, therefore, to\r\n    occupy on receipt of a special order the territory of Holland in\r\n    the first instance in the area of the Grebbe-Marse line. It will\r\n    depend on the military and political attitude of the Dutch as\r\n    well as on the effectiveness of their flooding, whether objects\r\n    can and must be further extended.” (_C-62_)\r\n\r\nThe operation had apparently been planned to take place at the beginning\r\nof November. We have in our possession a series of 17 letters dated from\r\n7th November until the 9th May postponing almost from day to day the\r\nD-day of the operation, so that by the beginning of November all the\r\nmajor plans and preparations had been made. (_C-72_)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th January 1940 a German aeroplane force landed in Belgium. In\r\nit was found the remains of a half-burnt operation order setting out\r\nconsiderable details of the Belgian landing grounds that were to be\r\ncaptured (_TC-58_). Many other documents have been found which\r\nillustrate the planning and preparation for this invasion in the latter\r\nhalf of 1939 and early 1940, but they carry the matter no further, and\r\nthey show no more clearly than the evidence to which I have already\r\nreferred, the plans and intention of the German Governments and its\r\narmed forces.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th May 1940 at about 0500 hours in the morning the German\r\ninvasion of Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg began.\r\n\r\nOnce more the forces of aggression marched on. Treaties, assurances, the\r\nrights of Sovereign States meant nothing. Brutal force, covered by as\r\ngreat an element of surprise as the Nazis could secure, was to seize\r\nthat which was deemed necessary for striking the mortal blow against\r\nEngland, the main Enemy. The only fault of these unhappy countries was\r\nthat they stood in the path of the German invader. But that was enough.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th April 1941 German armed forces invaded Greece and Yugoslavia.\r\nAgain the blow was struck without warning and with the cowardice and\r\ndeceit which the World now fully expected from the self-styled\r\n“_Herrenvolk_”. It was a breach of the Hague Convention of 1899. It was\r\na breach of the Pact of Paris of 1928. It was a breach of a specific\r\nassurance given by Hitler on the 6th October 1939.\r\n\r\n“Immediately after the completion of the Anschluss”, he said, “I\r\ninformed Yugoslavia that, from now on, the frontier with this country\r\nwill also be an unalterable one and that we only desire to live in Peace\r\nand Friendship with her”. (_TC-43_)\r\n\r\nBut the plan for aggression against Yugoslavia had, of course, been in\r\nhand well before that. In the aggressive action eastward towards the\r\nUkraine and the Soviet territories security of the Southern flank and\r\nthe lines of communication had already been considered.\r\n\r\nThe history of events leading up to the invasion of Yugoslavia by\r\nGermany is well known. At 3 o’clock on the morning of the 28th October\r\n1940 a 3-hour ultimatum had been presented by the Italian Government to\r\nthe Greek Government and the presentation of this ultimatum was followed\r\nby the aerial bombardment of Greek provincial towns and the advance of\r\nItalian troops into Greek territory. The Greeks, not prepared for such\r\nan assault, were at first forced to withdraw. Later the Italian advance\r\nwas first checked, then driven towards the Albanian frontier, and by the\r\nend of 1940 the Italian Army had suffered severe reverses at Greek\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nOf German intentions there is the evidence of what occurred when, on\r\n12th August 1939, Hitler held his meeting with Ciano.\r\n\r\nYou will remember Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “Generally speaking, the best thing to happen would be for the\r\n    neutrals to be liquidated one after the other. This process\r\n    could be carried out more easily if on every occasion one\r\n    partner of the Axis covered the other while it was dealing with\r\n    an uncertain neutral. Italy might well regard Yugoslavia as a\r\n    neutral of this kind.” (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\nLater again on the second day of the conversation, 13th August, he said:\r\n\r\n    “In general, however, from success by one of the Axis partners\r\n    not only strategical but also psychological strengthening of the\r\n    other partner and also of the whole Axis would ensue. Italy\r\n    carried through a number of successful operations in Abyssinia,\r\n    Spain and Albania and each time against the wishes of the\r\n    Democratic Entente. These individual actions have not only\r\n    strengthened Italian local interests but have also reinforced\r\n    her general position. The same was the case with German action\r\n    in Austria and Czechoslovakia. * * * The strengthening of the\r\n    Axis by these individual operations was of the greatest\r\n    importance for the unavoidable clash with the Western Powers.”\r\n\r\nOnce again we see the same procedure being followed. That meeting had\r\ntaken place on the 12/13th August, 1939. Less than two months later, on\r\n6 October 1939 Hitler was giving his assurance to Yugoslavia that\r\nGermany only desired to live in peace and friendship with the Yugoslav\r\nState, the liquidation of which by his Axis partner he had himself\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th October 1940 the Italians presented a 3 hour ultimatum to\r\nGreece and commenced war against her. Eventually the advance was\r\nchecked, then driven back, and the Italians suffered considerable\r\nreverses at Greek hands.\r\n\r\nWe have an undated letter from Hitler to Mussolini which must have been\r\nwritten about the time of the Italian aggression against Greece.\r\n(_2762-PS_)\r\n\r\n    “Permit me at the beginning of this letter to assure you that\r\n    within the last 14 days my heart and my thoughts have been more\r\n    than ever with you. Moreover, Duce, be assured of my\r\n    determination to do everything on your behalf which might ease\r\n    the present situation for you. * * * When I asked you to receive\r\n    me in Florence, I undertook the trip in the hope of being able\r\n    to express my views prior to the beginning of the threatening\r\n    conflict with Greece, about which I had only received general\r\n    information. First, I wanted to request you to postpone the\r\n    action, if possible until a more favorable time of year, at all\r\n    events, however, until after the American presidential election.\r\n    But in any case, however, I wanted to request you, Duce, not to\r\n    undertake this action without a previous lightning-like\r\n    occupation of Crete and, for this purpose, I also wanted to\r\n    submit to you some practical suggestions in regard to the\r\n    employment of a German parachute division and a further airborne\r\n    division. * * * Yugoslavia must become disinterested, if\r\n    possible, however from our point of view interested in\r\n    cooperating in the liquidation of the Greek question. Without\r\n    assurances from Yugoslavia, it is useless to risk any successful\r\n    operation in the Balkans. * * * Unfortunately I must stress the\r\n    fact that waging war in the Balkans before March is impossible.\r\n    Hence it would also serve to make any threatening influence upon\r\n    Yugoslavia of no purpose, since the Serbian General Staff is\r\n    well aware of the fact that no practical action could follow\r\n    such a threat before March. Here Yugoslavia must, if at all\r\n    possible, be won over by other means and other ways.”\r\n\r\nOn the 12th November in his Top Secret Order No. 18 Hitler ordered the\r\nOKH to make preparations to occupy Greece and Bulgaria if necessary.\r\nApproximately 10 divisions were to be used in order to prevent Turkish\r\nintervention. To shorten the time the German divisions in Rumania were\r\nto be increased.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th December 1940 Hitler issued an order to OKW, OKL, OKH, OKM\r\nand General Staff on the operation Marita, which was the invasion of\r\nGreece. In that order it is stated that the invasion of Greece is\r\nplanned and is to commence as soon as the weather becomes advantageous.\r\nFurther orders were issued on the 13th December and 11th January.\r\n(_448-PS_; _1541-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the 28th January Hitler saw Mussolini. Jodl, Keitel, and Ribbentrop\r\nwere present at the meeting and it is from Jodl’s notes of what took\r\nplace that we know that Hitler stated that one of the purposes of German\r\ntroop concentrations in Rumania was for use in his plan for the\r\noperation against Greece.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st March 1941 German troops entered Bulgaria and moved towards\r\nthe Greek frontier. In the face of this threat of an attack on Greece by\r\nGerman as well as Italian forces British forces were landed in Greece on\r\nthe 3d March in accordance with the declaration which had been given by\r\nthe British Government on the 13th April 1939 that Great Britain would\r\nfeel bound to give Greece and Rumania respectively all the support in\r\nher power in the event of either country becoming the victim of\r\naggression and resisting such aggression. Already the Italian aggression\r\nhad made this pledge operative.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th March 1941 Yugoslavia joined the 3-Power Pact which had\r\nalready been signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. The preamble of the\r\nPact stated that the 3 Powers would stand side by side and work\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Ribbentrop wrote two notes to the Yugoslav Prime\r\nMinister; assuring him of Germany’s full intention to respect the\r\nsovereignty and independence of his country. That declaration was yet\r\nanother example of the treachery employed by German diplomacy. We have\r\nseen already the preparations that had been made. We have seen Hitler’s\r\nefforts to tempt the Italians into an aggression against Yugoslavia. We\r\nhave seen in January his orders for his own preparation to invade\r\nYugoslavia and Greece and now on the 25th March he is signing a pact\r\nwith that country and his Foreign Minister is writing assurances of\r\nrespect for her sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the signing of that Pact the anti-Nazi element in\r\nYugoslavia immediately accomplished a coup d’état and established a new\r\nGovernment. Thereupon the decision was taken to invade immediately and\r\non the 27th March, two days after the 3-Power Pact had been signed by\r\nYugoslavia, Hitler issued instructions that Yugoslavia was to be invaded\r\nand used as a base for the continuance of the combined German and\r\nItalian offensive against Greece. (_C-127_)\r\n\r\nFollowing this, further deployment and other instructions for the action\r\nMarita were issued by Von Brauchitsch on the 30th March 1941. (_R-95_)\r\n\r\nIt is stated that “the orders issued with regard to the operation\r\nagainst Greece remain valid so far as not affected by this order. On the\r\n5th April, weather permitting, the Air Forces are to attack troops in\r\nYugoslavia, while simultaneously the attack of the 12th Army begins\r\nagainst both Yugoslavia and Greece” (_R-95_). As we now know, the\r\ninvasion actually commenced in the early hours of the 6th April.\r\n\r\nTreaties, Pacts, Assurances—obligations of any kind—are brushed aside\r\nand ignored wherever the aggressive interests of Germany are concerned.\r\n\r\nI turn now to the last act of aggression in Europe with which these Nazi\r\nconspirators are charged—the attack upon Russia. In August 1939 Germany\r\nalthough undoubtedly intending to attack Russia at some convenient\r\nopportunity, sufficiently deceived the Russian Government to secure a\r\npact of nonaggression between them. It followed, therefore, that when\r\nBelgium and the Low Countries were occupied and France collapsed in June\r\n1940, England—although with the inestimably valuable moral and economic\r\nsupport of the United States of America—was left alone as the sole\r\nrepresentative of Democracy in the face of the forces of aggression.\r\nOnly the British Empire stood between Germany and the achievement of her\r\naim to dominate the Western world. Only the British Empire—only England\r\nas its citadel. But it was enough. The first, and possibly the decisive,\r\nmilitary defeat which the enemy sustained was in the campaign against\r\nEngland, and that defeat had a profound influence on the future course\r\nof the war. On the 16th July 1940 Hitler issued to Keitel and Jodl a\r\nDirective for the invasion of England. It started off by stating—and\r\nEnglishmen will be forever proud of it—that\r\n\r\n    “Since England, despite her militarily hopeless situation, shows\r\n    no signs of willingness to come to terms, I have decided to\r\n    prepare a landing operation against England and if necessary to\r\n    carry it out. The aim is * * * to eliminate the English homeland\r\n    as a base for the carrying on of the war against Germany. The\r\n    preparations for the entire operation must be completed by\r\n    mid-August.” (_442-PS_)\r\n\r\nBut the first essential condition for that plan was “that the English\r\nAir Force must morally and actually be so far overcome that it does not\r\nany longer show any considerable aggressive force against the German\r\nattack.” (_442-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe German Air Force made the most strenuous efforts to realize that\r\ncondition, but, in one of the most splendid pages of our history, it was\r\ndecisively defeated. And although the bombardment of England’s towns and\r\nvillages was continued throughout that dark winter of 1940-41 the enemy\r\ndecided in the end that England was not to be subjugated by these means,\r\nand accordingly Germany turned back to the East, the first major aim\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d June 1941, German Armed Forces invaded Russia—without\r\nwarning, without declaration of war. It was a breach of the Hague\r\nConventions; it was a violation of the Pact of Paris of 1928: it was in\r\nflagrant contradiction of the Treaty of nonaggression which Germany and\r\nRussia had signed on the 23d August 1939.\r\n\r\nBut that Treaty, perhaps more blatantly than any other, was made without\r\nany intention of being observed and only for the purpose of assisting\r\nthe German Government to carry out their aggressive plans against the\r\nWestern democracies before eventually turning east in their own good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHitler himself in referring to the Agreement said agreements were only\r\nto be kept as long as they served a purpose. Ribbentrop was more\r\nexplicit. In an interview with the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin on 23d\r\nFebruary 1941 he made it clear that the object of the Agreement had\r\nmerely been to avoid a two-front war. (_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn contrast to what Hitler and Ribbentrop were planning within the\r\ncouncils of Germany, we know what they were saying to the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th July Hitler spoke in the Reichstag:\r\n\r\n    “In these circumstances I consider it proper to negotiate as a\r\n    first priority a sober definition of interests with Russia. It\r\n    would be made clear once and for all what Germany believes she\r\n    must regard as her sphere of interest to safeguard her future\r\n    and, on the other hand, what Russia considers important for her\r\n    existence.\r\n\r\n    “From the clear delineation of the sphere of interest on either\r\n    side, there followed the new regulation of Russo-German\r\n    relations. Any hope that now at the end of the term of the\r\n    agreement a new Russo-German tension could arise is childish.\r\n    Germany has taken no step which would lead her outside her\r\n    sphere of interest, nor has Russia. But England’s hope, to\r\n    achieve an amelioration of her own position through the\r\n    engineering of some new European crisis, is, in so far as it is\r\n    concerned with Russo-German relations, an illusion.\r\n\r\n    “British statesmen perceive everything somewhat slowly, but they\r\n    too will learn to understand this in course of time.”\r\n\r\nYet it was not many months after that that the arrangements for\r\nattacking Russia were put in hand. Raeder gives us the probable reasons\r\nfor this sudden decision in a note to Admiral Assmann.\r\n\r\n    “The fear that control of the air over the Channel in the Autumn\r\n    of 1940 could no longer be attained, a realization which the\r\n    Fuehrer no doubt gained earlier than the Naval War Staff, who\r\n    were not so fully informed of the true results of air raids on\r\n    England (our own losses), surely caused the Fuehrer, as far back\r\n    as August and September, to consider whether, even prior to\r\n    victory in the West, an Eastern campaign would be feasible with\r\n    the object of first eliminating our last serious opponent on the\r\n    continent. The Fuehrer did not openly express this fear,\r\n    however, until well into September.”\r\n\r\nHe may not have told the Navy of his intentions until later in\r\nSeptember, but by the beginning of that month he had undoubtedly spoken\r\nof them to Jodl.\r\n\r\nDated 6th September 1940 we have a directive of the OKW signed by Jodl:\r\n“Directions are given for the occupation forces in the east to be\r\nincreased in the following weeks. For security reasons this should not\r\ncreate the impression in Russia that Germany is preparing for an Eastern\r\noffensive.” Directives are given to the German Intelligence Service\r\npertaining to the answering of questions by the Russian Intelligence\r\nService. “The total strength of the German troops in the East to be\r\ncamouflaged by frequent changes in this area. The impression is to be\r\ncreated that the bulk of the troops in the south have moved whilst the\r\noccupation in the north is only very small.” (_1229-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus we see the beginning of the operations.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th November 1940 Hitler issued a directive signed by Jodl in\r\nwhich he stated that the political task to determine the attitude of\r\nRussia had begun, but without reference to the result of preparations\r\nagainst the East, which had been ordered orally before it could be\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Molotov visited Berlin. At the conclusion of\r\nconversations between himself and the German Government a communique was\r\nissued in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “The exchange of ideas took place in an atmosphere of mutual\r\n    trust and led to a mutual understanding on all important\r\n    questions interesting Germany and the Soviet Union.”\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the USSR would have taken part in those\r\nconversations or agreed to that communique if it had been realized that\r\non the very day orders were being given for preparations to be made for\r\nthe invasion of Russia and that the order for the operation “Barbarossa”\r\nwas in preparation. Four days later that order was issued—“The German\r\narmed forces have to be ready to defeat Soviet Russia in a swift\r\ncampaign before the end of the War against Great Britain” (_446-PS_).\r\nAnd later in the same instruction,\r\n\r\n    “All orders which shall be issued by the High Commanders in\r\n    accordance with this instruction have to be clothed in such\r\n    terms that they may be taken as measures of precaution in case\r\n    Russia should change her present attitude towards ourselves.”\r\n    (_446-PS_)\r\n\r\nKeeping up the pretense of friendliness, on the 10th January,\r\n1941—after the Plan Barbarossa for the invasion of Russia had been\r\ndecided upon—the German-Russo frontier treaty was signed. On the 3d\r\nFebruary 1941 Hitler held a conference, attended by Keitel and Jodl, at\r\nwhich it was provided that the whole operation was to be camouflaged as\r\nif it was part of the preparations for the “Seelowe” as the plan for\r\ninvasion of England was called. By March 1941 the plans were\r\nsufficiently advanced to include provision for dividing the Russian\r\nterritory into 9 separate States to be administered under Reich\r\nCommissars under the general control of Rosenberg. At the same time\r\ndetailed plans for the economic exploitation of the country were made\r\nunder the supervision of Goering, to whom the responsibility was\r\ndelegated by Hitler. You will hear something of the details of these\r\nplans. It is significant that on the 2d May 1941 a conference of the\r\nState Secretaries on the Plan Barbarossa noted:\r\n\r\n    “1. The war can only be continued if all armed forces are fed\r\n    out of Russia in the third year of the war.\r\n\r\n    “2. There is no doubt that as a result many millions of people\r\n    will be starved to death if we take out of the country the\r\n    things necessary for us.”\r\n\r\nBut this apparently created no concern. The plan Oldenberg, as the\r\nscheme for economic organization was called, went on. By the 1st May the\r\nD date of the operation was fixed. By the 1st June preparations were\r\nvirtually complete and an elaborate time table was issued. It was\r\nestimated that although there would be heavy frontier battles, lasting\r\nperhaps 4 weeks, after that no serious opposition was to be expected.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d June at 3.30 in the morning the German Armies marched again.\r\nAs Hitler said in his Proclamation:\r\n\r\n    “I have decided to give the fate of the German People and of the\r\n    Reich and of Europe again into the hands of our soldiers.”\r\n\r\nThe usual false pretexts were of course given. Ribbentrop stated on the\r\n28th June that the step was taken because of the threatening of the\r\nGerman frontiers by the Red Army. It was untrue and Ribbentrop knew it\r\nwas untrue. On the 7th June his Ambassador in Moscow was reporting to\r\nhim that “All observations show that Stalin and Molotov who are alone\r\nresponsible for Russian foreign policy are doing everything to avoid a\r\nconflict with Germany”. The staff records which you will see make it\r\nclear that the Russians were making no military preparations and that\r\nthey were continuing their deliveries under the Trade Agreement to the\r\nvery last day. The truth was, of course, that the elimination of Russia\r\nas a political opponent and the incorporation of the Russian territory\r\nin the German _Lebensraum_ had long been one of the cardinal features of\r\nNazi policy, subordinated latterly for what Jodl called diplomatic\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on the 22d June, the Nazi armies were flung against the Power\r\nwith which Hitler had so recently sworn friendship and Germany embarked\r\non that last act of aggression which, after long and bitter fighting,\r\nwas eventually to result in Germany’s own collapse.\r\n\r\n                                PART III\r\n\r\nThis then is the case against these Defendants, as amongst the rulers of\r\nGermany, under Count 2 of this Indictment. It may be said that many of\r\nthe documents which have been referred to were in Hitler’s name, that\r\nthe orders were Hitler’s orders, that these men were mere instruments of\r\nHitler’s will. But they were the instruments without which Hitler’s will\r\ncould not be carried out. And they were more than that. These men were\r\nno mere willing tools, although they would be guilty enough if that had\r\nbeen their role. They are the men whose support had built Hitler up into\r\nthe position of power he occupied: they are the men whose initiative and\r\nplanning perhaps conceived and certainly made possible the acts of\r\naggression made in Hitler’s name, and they are the men who enabled\r\nHitler to build up the Army, Navy and Air Force by which these\r\ntreacherous attacks were carried out, and to lead his fanatical\r\nfollowers into peaceful countries to murder, to loot and to destroy.\r\nThey are the men whose cooperation and support made the Nazi Government\r\nof Germany possible. The Government of a totalitarian country may be\r\ncarried on without the assistance of representatives of the people. But\r\nit cannot be carried on without any assistance at all. It is no use\r\nhaving a leader unless there are also people willing and ready to serve\r\ntheir personal greed and ambition by helping and following him. The\r\ndictator who is set up in control of the destinies of his country does\r\nnot depend upon himself alone either in acquiring power or in\r\nmaintaining it. He depends upon the support and backing which lesser\r\nmen, themselves lusting to share in dictatorial power, anxious to bask\r\nin the adulation of their leader, are prepared to give. In the Criminal\r\nCourts, where men are put upon their trial for breaches of the municipal\r\nlaws, it not infrequently happens that of a gang indicted together in\r\nthe Dock, one has the master mind, the leading personality. But it is no\r\nexcuse for the common thief to say “I stole because I was told to\r\nsteal”; for the murderer to plead “I killed because I was asked to\r\nkill”. These men are in no different position for all that it was\r\nnations they sought to rob, whole peoples they tried to kill. “The\r\nwarrant of no man excuseth the doing of an illegal act.” Political\r\nloyalty, military obedience are excellent things. But they neither\r\nrequire nor do they justify the commission of patently wicked acts.\r\nThere comes a point where a man must refuse to answer to his leader if\r\nhe is also to answer to his conscience. Even the common soldier, serving\r\nin the ranks of his Army is not called upon to obey illegal orders. But\r\nthese men were no common soldiers: they were the men whose skill and\r\ncunning, whose labour and activity made it possible for the German Reich\r\nto tear up existing treaties, to enter into new ones and to flout them,\r\nto reduce international negotiations and diplomacy to a hollow mockery,\r\nto destroy all respect for and effect in International Law and finally\r\nto march against the peoples of the world to secure that domination in\r\nwhich as arrogant members of their self-styled master race they\r\nprofessed their belief. If the crimes were in one sense the crimes of\r\nNazi Germany, they also are guilty as the individuals who aided,\r\nabetted, counselled, procured and made possible the commission of what\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nThe sum total of the crime these men have committed—so awful in its\r\ncomprehension—has many aspects. Their lust and sadism, their deliberate\r\nslaughter and the degradation of so many millions of their fellow\r\ncreatures that the imagination reels incomprehensively, are but one side\r\nonly of this matter. Now that an end has been put to this nightmare and\r\nwe come to consider how the future is to be lived, perhaps their guilt\r\nas murderers and robbers is of less importance and of less effect to\r\nfuture generations of mankind than their crime of fraud—the fraud by\r\nwhich they placed themselves in a position to do their murder and their\r\nrobbery. This is the other aspect of their guilt. The story of their\r\n“diplomacy”, founded upon cunning, hypocrisy and bad faith, is a story\r\nless gruesome but no less evil and deliberate. And should it be taken as\r\na precedent of behaviour in the conduct of international relations, its\r\nconsequences to mankind will no less certainly lead to the end of\r\ncivilized society. Without trust and confidence between Nations, without\r\nthe faith that what is said is meant and what is undertaken will be\r\nobserved, all hope of peace and of security is dead. The Governments of\r\nthe United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, of the USA, of the\r\nUSSR, and of France, backed by and on behalf of every other peace-loving\r\nNation of the world, have therefore joined to bring the inventors and\r\nperpetrators of this Nazi conception of international relationship\r\nbefore the bar of this Tribunal.\r\n\r\nThey do so that these Defendants may be punished for their crimes. They\r\ndo so also that their conduct may be exposed in its naked wickedness.\r\nAnd they do so in the hope that the conscience and good sense of all the\r\nworld will see the consequences of such conduct and the end to which\r\ninevitably it must always lead. Let us once again restore sanity and\r\nwith it also the sanctity of our obligations towards each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n             6. AGGRESSION AS A BASIC NAZI IDEA: MEIN KAMPF\r\n\r\nHitler’s _Mein Kampf_, which became the Nazi statement of faith, gave to\r\nthe conspirators adequate foreknowledge of the unlawful aims of the Nazi\r\nleadership. It was not only Hitler’s political testament; by adoption it\r\nbecame theirs.\r\n\r\n_Mein Kampf_ may be described as the blueprint of the Nazi aggression.\r\nIts whole tenor and content demonstrate that the Nazi pursuit of\r\naggressive designs was no mere accident arising out of an immediate\r\npolitical situation in Europe and the world. _Mein Kampf_ establishes\r\nunequivocally that the use of aggressive war to serve German aims in\r\nforeign policy was part of the very creed of the Nazi party.\r\n\r\nA great German philosopher once said that ideas have hands and feet. It\r\nbecame the deliberate aim of the conspirators to see to it that the\r\nidea, doctrines, and policies of _Mein Kampf_ should become the active\r\nfaith and guide for action of the German nation, and particularly of its\r\nmalleable youth. From 1933 to 1939 an extensive indoctrination in the\r\nideas of _Mein Kampf_ was pursued in the schools and universities of\r\nGermany, as well as in the Hitler Youth, under the direction of Baldur\r\nvon Schirach, and in the SA and SS, and amongst the German population as\r\na whole, by the agency of Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nA copy of _Mein Kampf_ was officially presented by the Nazis to all\r\nnewly married couples in Germany. [A copy of _Mein Kampf_ (_D-660_)\r\nsubmitted by the prosecution to the tribunal contains the following\r\ndedication on the fly-leaf:\r\n\r\n    “To the newly married couple, Friedrich Rosebrock and Else\r\n    Geborene Zum Beck, with best wishes for a happy and blessed\r\n    marriage. Presented by the Communal Administration on the\r\n    occasion of their marriage on the 14th of November, 1940. For\r\n    the Mayor, the Registrar.”\r\n\r\nThis copy of _Mein Kampf_, which was the 1945 edition, contains the\r\ninformation that the number of copies published to date amount to\r\n6,250,000.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the efforts of the conspirators, this book, blasphemously\r\ncalled “The Bible of the German people,” poisoned a generation and\r\ndistorted the outlook of a whole people. For as the SS General von dem\r\nBach-Zelewski testified before the Tribunal, [on 7 January 1946] if it\r\nis preached for years, as long as ten years, that the Slav peoples are\r\ninferior races and that the Jews are subhuman, then it must logically\r\nfollow that the killing of millions of these human beings is accepted as\r\na natural phenomenon. From _Mein Kampf_ the way leads directly to the\r\nfurnaces of Auschwitz and the gas chambers of Maidanek.\r\n\r\nWhat the commandments of _Mein Kampf_ were may be indicated by\r\nquotations from the book which fall into two main categories. The first\r\ncategory is that of general expression of Hitler’s belief in the\r\nnecessity of force as the means of solving international problems. The\r\nsecond category is that of Hitler’s more explicit declarations on the\r\npolicy which Germany should pursue.\r\n\r\nMost of the quotations in the second category come from the last three\r\nchapters—13, 14, and 15—of Part II of _Mein Kampf_, in which Hitler’s\r\nviews on foreign policy were expounded. The significance of this may be\r\ngrasped from the fact that Part II of _Mein Kampf_ was first published\r\nin 1927, less than two years after the Locarno Pact and within a few\r\nmonths of Germany’s entry into the League of Nations. The date of the\r\npublication of these passages, therefore, brands them as a repudiation\r\nof the policy of international cooperation embarked upon by Stresseman,\r\nand as a deliberate defiance of the attempt to establish, through the\r\nLeague of Nations, the rule of law in international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe following are quotations showing the general view held by Hitler and\r\naccepted and propagated by the conspirators concerning war and\r\naggression generally. On page 556 of _Mein Kampf_, Hitler wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The soil on which we now live was not a gift bestowed by Heaven\r\n    on our forefathers. But they had to conquer it by risking their\r\n    lives. So also in the future our people will not obtain\r\n    territory, and therewith the means of existence, as a favour\r\n    from any other people, but will have to win it by the power of a\r\n    triumphant sword.”\r\n\r\nOn page 145, Hitler revealed his own personal attitude toward war. Of\r\nthe years of peace before 1914 he wrote:\r\n\r\n    “Thus I used to think it an ill-deserved stroke of bad luck that\r\n    I had arrived too late on this terrestrial globe, and I felt\r\n    chagrined at the idea that my life would have to run its course\r\n    along peaceful and orderly lines. As a boy I was anything but a\r\n    pacifist and all attempts to make me so turned out futile.”\r\n\r\nOn page 162 Hitler wrote of war in these words:\r\n\r\n    “In regard to the part played by humane feeling, Moltke stated\r\n    that in time of war the essential thing is to get a decision as\r\n    quickly as possible and that the most ruthless methods of\r\n    fighting are at the same time the most humane. When people\r\n    attempt to answer this reasoning by highfalutin talk about\r\n    aesthetics, etc., only one answer can be given. It is that the\r\n    vital questions involved in the struggle of a nation for its\r\n    existence must not be subordinated to any aesthetic\r\n    considerations.”\r\n\r\nHitler’s assumption of an inevitable law of struggle for survival is\r\nlinked up in Chapter II of Book I of _Mein Kampf_, with the doctrine of\r\nAryan superiority over other races and the right of Germans in virtue of\r\nthis superiority to dominate and use other peoples for their own ends.\r\nThe whole of Chapter II of _Mein Kampf_ is dedicated to this “master\r\nrace” theory and, indeed, many of the later speeches of Hitler were\r\nmainly repetitive of Chapter II.\r\n\r\nOn page 256, the following sentiments appear:\r\n\r\n    “Had it not been possible for them to employ members of the\r\n    inferior race which they conquered, the Aryans would never have\r\n    been in a position to take the first steps on the road which led\r\n    them to a later type of culture; just as, without the help of\r\n    certain suitable animals which they were able to tame, they\r\n    would never have come to the invention of mechanical power,\r\n    which has subsequently enabled them to do without these beasts.\r\n    For the establishment of superior types of civilization the\r\n    members of inferior races formed one of the most essential\r\n    prerequisites.”\r\n\r\nIn a later passage in _Mein Kampf_, at page 344, Hitler applies these\r\ngeneral ideas to Germany:\r\n\r\n    “If in its historical development the German people had\r\n    possessed the unity of herd instinct by which other people have\r\n    so much benefited, then the German Reich would probably be\r\n    mistress of the globe today. World history would have taken\r\n    another course, and in this case no man can tell if what many\r\n    blinded pacifists hope to attain by petitioning, whining and\r\n    crying may not have been reached in this way; namely, a peace\r\n    which would not be based upon the waving of olive branches and\r\n    tearful misery-mongering of pacifist old women, but a peace that\r\n    would be guaranteed by the triumphant sword of a people endowed\r\n    with the power to master the world and administer it in the\r\n    service of a higher civilization.”\r\n\r\nThese passages emphasize clearly Hitler’s love of war and scorn of those\r\nwhom he described as pacifists. The underlying message of this book,\r\nwhich appears again and again, is, firstly, that the struggle for\r\nexistence requires the organization and use of force; secondly, that the\r\nAryan-German is superior to other races and has the right to conquer and\r\nrule them; thirdly, that all doctrines which preach peaceable solutions\r\nof international problems represent a disastrous weakness in a nation\r\nthat adopts them. Implicit in the whole of the argument is a fundamental\r\nand arrogant denial of the possibility of any rule of law in\r\ninternational affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is in the light of these general doctrines of _Mein Kampf_ that the\r\nmore definite passages should be considered, in which Hitler deals with\r\nspecific problems of German foreign policy. The very first page of the\r\nbook contains a remarkable forecast of Nazi policy:\r\n\r\n    “German-Austria must be restored to the great German Motherland.\r\n    And not, indeed on any grounds of economic calculation\r\n    whatsoever. No, no. Even if the union were a matter of economic\r\n    indifference, and even if it were to be disadvantageous from the\r\n    economic standpoint, still it ought to take place. People of the\r\n    same blood should be in the same Reich. The German people will\r\n    have no right to engage in a colonial policy until they shall\r\n    have brought all their children together in one State. When the\r\n    territory of the Reich embraces all the Germans and finds itself\r\n    unable to assure them a livelihood, only then can the moral\r\n    right arise, from the need of the people, to acquire foreign\r\n    territory. The plough is then the sword; and the tears of war\r\n    will produce the daily bread for the generations to come.”\r\n\r\nHitler, at page 553, declares that the mere restoration of Germany’s\r\nfrontiers as they were in 1914 would be wholly insufficient for his\r\npurposes:\r\n\r\n    “In regard to this point I should like to make the following\r\n    statement: To demand that the 1914 frontiers should be restored\r\n    is a glaring political absurdity that is fraught with such\r\n    consequences as to make the claim itself appear criminal. The\r\n    confines of the Reich as they existed in 1914 were thoroughly\r\n    illogical; because they were not really complete, in the sense\r\n    of including all the members of the German nation. Nor were they\r\n    reasonable, in view of the geographical exigencies of military\r\n    defense. They were not the consequence of a political plan which\r\n    had been well considered and carried out, but they were\r\n    temporary frontiers established in virtue of a political\r\n    struggle that had not been brought to a finish; and indeed, they\r\n    were partly the chance result of circumstances.”\r\n\r\nIn further elaboration of Nazi policy, Hitler does not merely denounce\r\nthe Treaty of Versailles; he desires to see a Germany which is a world\r\npower with territory sufficient for a future German people of a\r\nmagnitude which he does not define. On page 554 he declares:\r\n\r\n    “For the future of the German nation the 1914 frontiers are of\r\n    no significance * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “We National Socialists must stick firmly to the aim that we\r\n    have set for our foreign policy, namely, that the German people\r\n    must be assured the territorial area which is necessary for it\r\n    to exist on this earth. And only for such action as is\r\n    undertaken to secure those ends can it be lawful in the eyes of\r\n    God and our German posterity to allow the blood of our people to\r\n    be shed once again. Before God, because we are sent into this\r\n    world with the commission to struggle for our daily bread, as\r\n    creatures to whom nothing is donated and who must be able to win\r\n    and hold their position as lord of the earth only through their\r\n    own intelligence and courage. “And this justification must be\r\n    established also before our German posterity, on the grounds\r\n    that for each one who has shed his blood the life of a thousand\r\n    others will be guaranteed to posterity. The territory on which\r\n    one day our German peasants will be able to bring forth and\r\n    nourish their sturdy sons will justify the blood of the sons of\r\n    the peasants that has to be shed today. And the statesmen who\r\n    will have decreed this sacrifice may be persecuted by their\r\n    contemporaries, but posterity will absolve them from all guilt\r\n    for having demanded this offering from their people.”\r\n\r\nAt page 557 Hitler writes:\r\n\r\n    “Germany will either become a world power or will not continue\r\n    to exist at all. But in order to become a world power, it needs\r\n    that territorial magnitude which gives it the necessary\r\n    importance today and assures the existence of its citizens.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “We must take our stand on the principles already mentioned in\r\n    regard to foreign policy, namely, the necessity of bringing our\r\n    territorial area into just proportion with the number of our\r\n    population. From the past we can learn only one lesson, and that\r\n    is that the aim which is to be pursued in our political conduct\r\n    must be twofold, namely: (1) the acquisition of territory as the\r\n    objective of our foreign policy and (2) the establishment of a\r\n    new and uniform foundation as the objective of our political\r\n    activities at home, in accordance with our doctrine of\r\n    nationhood.”\r\n\r\nNow, these passages from _Mein Kampf_ raise the question, where did\r\nHitler expect to find the increased territory beyond the 1914 boundaries\r\nof Germany? To this Hitler’s answer is sufficiently explicit. Reviewing\r\nthe history of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918, he wrote, on page\r\n132:\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, the only possibility which Germany had of carrying a\r\n    sound territorial policy into effect was that of acquiring new\r\n    territory in Europe itself. Colonies cannot serve this purpose\r\n    so long as they are not suited for settlement by Europeans on a\r\n    large scale. In the nineteenth century it was no longer possible\r\n    to acquire such colonies by peaceful means. Therefore, any\r\n    attempt at such colonial expansion would have meant an enormous\r\n    military struggle. Consequently it would have been more\r\n    practical to undertake that military struggle for new territory\r\n    in Europe, rather than to wage war for the acquisition of\r\n    possessions abroad.\r\n\r\n    “Such a decision naturally demanded that the nation’s undivided\r\n    energies should be devoted to it. A policy of that kind, which\r\n    requires for its fulfillment every ounce of available energy on\r\n    the part of everybody concerned, cannot be carried into effect\r\n    by half measures or in a hesitant manner. The political\r\n    leadership of the German Empire should then have been directed\r\n    exclusively to this goal. No political step should have been\r\n    taken in response to other considerations than this task and the\r\n    means of accomplishing it. Germany should have been alive to the\r\n    fact that such a goal could have been reached only by war, and\r\n    the prospect of war should have been faced with calm and\r\n    collected determination. The whole system of alliances should\r\n    have been envisaged and valued from that standpoint.\r\n\r\n    “If new territory were to be acquired in Europe it must have\r\n    been mainly at Russia’s cost, and once again the new German\r\n    Empire should have set out on its march along the same road as\r\n    was formerly trodden by the Teutonic Knights, this time to\r\n    acquire soil for the German plough by means of the German sword\r\n    and thus provide the nation with its daily bread.”\r\n\r\nTo this program of expansion in the East Hitler returns again, at the\r\nend of _Mein Kampf_. After discussing the insufficiency of Germany’s\r\npre-war frontiers, he again points the path to the East and declares\r\nthat the _Drang nach Osten_, the drive to the East, must be resumed:\r\n\r\n    “Therefore we National Socialists have purposely drawn a line\r\n    through the line of conduct followed by pre-war Germany in\r\n    foreign policy. We put an end to the perpetual Germanic march\r\n    towards the South and West of Europe and turn our eyes towards\r\n    the lands of the East. We finally put a stop to the colonial and\r\n    trade policy of pre-war times and pass over to the territorial\r\n    policy of the future. But when we speak of new territory in\r\n    Europe today we must principally think of Russia and the border\r\n    states subject to her.”\r\n\r\nHitler was shrewd enough to see that his aggressive designs in the East\r\nmight be endangered by a defensive alliance between Russia, France, and\r\nperhaps England. His foreign policy, as outlined in _Mein Kampf_, was to\r\ndetach England and Italy from France and Russia and to change the\r\nattitude of Germany towards France from the defensive to the offensive.\r\n\r\nOn page 570 of _Mein Kampf_ he wrote:\r\n\r\n    “As long as the eternal conflict between France and Germany is\r\n    waged only in the form of a German defense against the French\r\n    attack, that conflict can never be decided, and from century to\r\n    century Germany will lose one position after another. If we\r\n    study the changes that have taken place, from the twelfth\r\n    century up to our day, in the frontiers within which the German\r\n    language is spoken, we can hardly hope for a successful issue to\r\n    result from the acceptance and development of a line of conduct\r\n    which has hitherto been so detrimental for us.\r\n\r\n    “Only when the Germans have taken all this fully into account\r\n    will they cease from allowing the national will-to-live to wear\r\n    itself out in merely passive defense; but they will rally\r\n    together for a last decisive contest with France. And in this\r\n    contest the essential objective of the German nation will be\r\n    fought for. Only then will it be possible to put an end to the\r\n    eternal Franco-German conflict which has hitherto proved so\r\n    sterile.\r\n\r\n    “Of course it is here presumed that Germany sees in the\r\n    suppression of France nothing more than a means which will make\r\n    it possible for our people finally to expand in another quarter.\r\n    Today there are eighty million Germans in Europe. And our\r\n    foreign policy will be recognized as rightly conducted only\r\n    when, after barely a hundred years, there will be 250 million\r\n    Germans living on this Continent, not packed together as the\r\n    coolies in the factories of another Continent but as tillers of\r\n    the soil and workers whose labour will be a mutual assurance for\r\n    their existence.”\r\n\r\n_Mein Kampf_, taken in conjunction with the facts of Nazi Germany’s\r\nsubsequent behavior towards other countries, shows that from the very\r\nfirst moment that they attained power, and indeed long before that time,\r\nHitler and his confederates were engaged in planning and fomenting\r\naggressive war.\r\n\r\nEvents have proved that _Mein Kampf_ was no mere literary exercise to be\r\ntreated with easy indifference, as unfortunately it was treated for so\r\nlong. It was the expression of a fanatical faith in force and fraud as\r\nthe means to Nazi dominance in Europe, if not in the whole world. In\r\naccepting and propagating the jungle philosophy of _Mein Kampf_, the\r\nNazi conspirators deliberately set about to push civilization over the\r\nprecipice of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          7. TREATY VIOLATIONS\r\n\r\nIt might be thought, from the melancholy story of broken treaties and\r\nviolated assurances, that Hitler and the Nazi Government did not even\r\nprofess that it is necessary or desirable to keep the pledged word.\r\nOutwardly, however, the professions were very different. With regard to\r\ntreaties, on the 18 October 1933, Hitler said, “Whatever we have signed\r\nwe will fulfill to the best of our ability.”\r\n\r\nThe reservation is significant—“Whatever we have signed.”\r\n\r\nBut, on 21 May 1935, Hitler said, “The German Government will\r\nscrupulously maintain every treaty voluntarily signed, even though it\r\nwas concluded before their accession to power and office.”\r\n\r\nOn assurances Hitler was even more emphatic. In the same speech, the\r\nReichstag Speech of 21 May 1935, Hitler accepted assurances as being of\r\nequal obligation, and the world at that time could not know that that\r\nmeant of no obligation at all. What he actually said was,\r\n\r\n    “And when I now hear from the lips of a British statesman that\r\n    such assurances are nothing and that the only proof of sincerity\r\n    is the signature appended to collective pacts, I must ask Mr.\r\n    Eden to be good enough to remember that it is a question of\r\n    assurance in any case. It is sometimes much easier to sign\r\n    treaties with the mental reservations that one will consider\r\n    one’s attitude at the decisive hour than to declare before an\r\n    entire nation and with full opportunity one’s adherence to a\r\n    policy which serves the course of peace because it rejects\r\n    anything which leads to war.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he proceeded with the illustration of his assurance to France.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the position of a treaty in German law should not be\r\nforgotten. The appearance of a treaty in the _Reichsgesetzblatt_ makes\r\nit part of the statute law of Germany, so that a breach thereof is also\r\na violation of German domestic law.\r\n\r\n(This section deals with fifteen only of the treaties which Hitler and\r\nthe Nazis broke. The remainder of the 69 treaties which the German Reich\r\nviolated between 1933 and 1941 are dealt with in other sections of this\r\nchapter.)\r\n\r\nA. _Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes,\r\nsigned at the Hague on the 29th of July, 1899._\r\n\r\nThe Hague Conventions are of course only the first gropings towards the\r\nrejection of the inevitability of war. They do not render the making of\r\naggressive war a crime, but their milder terms were as readily broken as\r\nmore severe agreements.\r\n\r\nOn 29 July, 1899, Germany, Greece, Serbia, and 25 other nations signed a\r\nconvention (_TC-1_). Germany ratified the convention on 4 September\r\n1900, Serbia on the 11 May 1901, Greece on the 4 April 1901.\r\n\r\nBy Article 12 of the treaty between the Principal Allied and Associated\r\nPowers and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, signed at the St.\r\nGermaine-en-Laye on 10 September 1919, the new Kingdom succeeded to all\r\nthe old Serbian treaties, and later changed its name to Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nThe first two articles of this Hague Convention read:\r\n\r\n    “Article 1: With a view to obviating as far as possible recourse\r\n    to force in the relations between states, the signatory powers\r\n    agree to use their best efforts to insure the pacific settlement\r\n    of International differences.\r\n\r\n    “Article 2: In case of serious disagreement or conflict, before\r\n    an appeal to arms the signatory powers agree to have recourse,\r\n    as far as circumstances allow, to the good offices or mediation\r\n    of one or more friendly powers.” (_TC-1_)\r\n\r\nB. _Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes,\r\nsigned at the Hague on 18 October 1907._\r\n\r\nThis Convention (_TC-2_) was signed at the Hague by 44 nations, and it\r\nis in effect as to 31 nations, 28 signatories, and three adherents. For\r\npresent purposes it is in force as to the United States, Belgium,\r\nCzechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Japan,\r\nNetherlands, Norway, Poland, and Russia.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of Article 91 it replaces the 1899 Convention as\r\nbetween the contracting powers. As Greece and Yugoslavia are parties to\r\nthe 1899 convention and not to the 1907, the 1899 Convention is in\r\neffect with regard to them, and that explains the division of countries\r\nin Appendix C.\r\n\r\nThe first article of this treaty reads:\r\n\r\n    “1: With a view to obviating as far as possible recourse to\r\n    force in the relations between States, the contracting powers\r\n    agree to use their best efforts to insure the pacific settlement\r\n    of international differences.” (_TC-2_)\r\n\r\nC. _Convention Relative to the Opening of Hostilities, signed at the\r\nHague on 18 October 1907._\r\n\r\nThis Convention (_TC-3_) applies to Germany, Poland, Norway, Denmark,\r\nBelgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Russia. It relates to a\r\nprocedural step in notifying one’s prospective opponent before opening\r\nhostilities against him. It appears, to have had its immediate origin in\r\nthe Russo-Japanese war of 1904, when Japan attacked Russia without any\r\nprevious warning. It will be noted that it does not fix any particular\r\nlapse of time between the giving of notice and the commencement of\r\nhostilities, but it does seek to maintain an absolutely minimum standard\r\nof International decency before the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nThe first article of this treaty reads:\r\n\r\n    “The contracting powers recognize that hostilities between them\r\n    must not commence without a previous and explicit warning in the\r\n    form of either a declaration of war, giving reasons, or an\r\n    ultimatum with a conditional declaration of war.” (_TC-3_)\r\n\r\nD. _Convention 5, Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and\r\nPersons in Case of War on Land, signed at the Hague on 18 October 1907._\r\n\r\nGermany was an original signatory to this Convention (_TC-4_), and the\r\ntreaty is in force as a result of ratification or adherence between\r\nGermany and Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, the\r\nUSSR, and the United States.\r\n\r\nArticle 1 reads:\r\n\r\n    “The territory of neutral powers is inviolable.” (_TC-4_)\r\n\r\nA point arises on this Convention. Under Article 20, the provisions of\r\nthe present Convention do not apply except between the contracting\r\npowers, and then only if all the belligerents are parties to the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nAs Great Britain and France entered the war within two days of the\r\noutbreak of the war between Germany and Poland, and one of these powers\r\nhad not ratified the Convention, it is arguable that its provisions did\r\nnot apply to the Second World War.\r\n\r\nSince there are many more important treaties to be considered, the\r\ncharge will not be pressed that this treaty was likewise breached. The\r\nterms of Article 1 are cited merely as showing the state of\r\nInternational opinion at the time, and as an element in the aggressive\r\ncharacter of the war.\r\n\r\nE. _Treaty of Peace between the Allies and the Associated Powers of\r\nGermany, signed at Versailles on 28 June 1919._\r\n\r\nPart I of this treaty (_TC-5 thru TC-10_) contains the Covenant of the\r\nLeague of Nations, and Part II sets the boundaries of Germany in Europe.\r\nThese boundaries are described in detail. Part II makes no provision for\r\nguaranteeing these boundaries. Part III, Articles 31 to 117, contains\r\nthe political clauses for Europe. In it, Germany guarantees certain\r\nterritorial boundaries in Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Czechoslovakia,\r\nFrance, Poland, Memel, Danzig, etc.\r\n\r\nThis treaty is interwoven with the next, which is the Treaty of\r\nRestoration of Friendly Relations between the United States and Germany.\r\nParts I, II, and III of the Versailles Treaty are not included in the\r\nUnited States Treaty. Parts IV, V, VI, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIV, and XV\r\nare all repeated _verbatim_ in the United States Treaty from the Treaty\r\nof Versailles. This case is concerned with Part V, which are the\r\nmilitary, naval, and air clauses. Parts VII and XIII are not included in\r\nthe United States Treaty.\r\n\r\n(1) _Territorial Guarantees._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Rhineland._ The first part with which this case is concerned\r\nis Articles 42 to 44 dealing with the Rhineland (_TC-5_). These are\r\nrepeated in the Locarno Treaty. They read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Article 42: Germany is forbidden to maintain or construct any\r\n    fortifications either on the left bank of the Rhine or on the\r\n    right bank to the west of a line drawn 50 kilometers to the east\r\n    of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n    “Article 43: In the area defined above the maintenance and the\r\n    assembly of armed forces, either permanently or temporarily, and\r\n    military maneuvers of any kind, as well as the upkeep of all\r\n    permanent works for mobilization, are in the same way forbidden.\r\n\r\n    “Article 44: In case Germany violates in any manner whatever the\r\n    provisions of Articles 42 and 43, she shall be regarded as\r\n    committing a hostile act against the powers signatory of the\r\n    present treaty and as calculated to disturb the peace of the\r\n    world.”\r\n\r\n(The speech by Hitler on 7 March 1936, giving his account of the breach\r\nof this treaty (_2289-PS_), is discussed in Section 2, _supra_.)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Austria._ The next part of the Treaty deals with Austria:\r\n\r\n    “Article 80: Germany acknowledges and will respect strictly the\r\n    independence of Austria within the frontiers which may be fixed\r\n    in a treaty between that State and the principal Allied and\r\n    Associated powers; she agrees that this independence shall be\r\n    inalienable, except with the consent of the Council of the\r\n    League of Nations.” (_TC-6_)\r\n\r\n(The proclamation of Hitler dealing with Austria (_TC-47_), is discussed\r\nin Section 3 _supra_.)\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Memel._ Germany also gave guarantee with respect to Memel:\r\n\r\n    “Germany renounces, in favor of the principal Allied and\r\n    Associated powers, all rights and title over the territories\r\n    included between the Baltic, the Northeastern frontier of East\r\n    Prussia as defined in Article 28 of Part II (Boundaries of\r\n    Germany) of the present treaty, and the former frontier between\r\n    Germany and Russia. Germany undertakes to accept the settlement\r\n    made by principal Allied and Associated powers in regard to\r\n    these territories, particularly insofar as concerns the\r\n    nationality of inhabitants.” (_TC-8_)\r\n\r\nThe formal document by which Germany incorporated Memel into the Reich,\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The transfer Commissioner for the Memel territory, _Gauleiter\r\n    und Oberpraesident_ Erich Koch, effected on 3 April 1939, during\r\n    a conference at Memel, the final incorporation of the late Memel\r\n    territory into the National Socialist Party Gau of East Prussia\r\n    and into the state administration of the East Prussian\r\n    _Regierungsbezirk_ of Grunbinnen.” (_TC-53-A_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Danzig._ Article 100 of the treaty relates to Danzig:\r\n\r\n    “Germany renounces, in favor of the principal Allied and\r\n    Associated Powers, all rights and title over the territory\r\n    comprised within the following limits * * * (The limits are set\r\n    out and are described in a German map attached to the Treaty.)\r\n    (_TC-9_)\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Czechoslovakia._ In Article 81, Germany made pledges regarding\r\nCzechoslovakia:\r\n\r\n    “Germany, in conformity with the action already taken by the\r\n    Allied and Associated Powers, recognizes the complete\r\n    independence of the Czechoslovak State, which will include the\r\n    autonomous territory of the Ruthenians to the South of the\r\n    Carpathians. Germany hereby recognizes the frontiers of this\r\n    State as determined by the principal Allied and Associated\r\n    Powers and other interested states.” (_TC-7_)\r\n\r\nCaptured minutes of the German Foreign Office record in detail the\r\nconference between Hitler and President Hacha, and Foreign Minister\r\nChvalkowsky of Czechoslovakia, at which Goering and Keitel were present\r\n(_2798-PS_). The agreement subsequently signed by Hitler and Ribbentrop\r\nfor Germany, and by Dr. Hacha and Dr. Chvalkowsky for Czechoslovakia,\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Text of the Agreement between the Fuehrer and Reichs Chancellor\r\n    Adolf Hitler and the President of the Czechoslovak State, Dr.\r\n    Hacha.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and Reichs Chancellor today received in Berlin, at\r\n    their own request, the President of the Czechoslovak State, Dr.\r\n    Hacha, and the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, Dr. Chvalkowsky,\r\n    in the presence of Herr Von Ribbentrop, the Foreign Minister of\r\n    the Reich. At this meeting the serious situation which had\r\n    arisen within the previous territory of Czechoslovakia owing to\r\n    the events of recent weeks, was subjected to a completely open\r\n    examination. The conviction was unanimously expressed on both\r\n    sides that the object of all their efforts must be to assure\r\n    quiet, order and peace in this part of Central Europe. The\r\n    President of the Czechoslovak State declared that, in order to\r\n    serve this end and to reach a final pacification, he confidently\r\n    placed the fate of the Czech people and of their country in the\r\n    hands of the Fuehrer of the German Reich. The Fuehrer accepted\r\n    this declaration and expressed his decision to assure to the\r\n    Czech people, under the protection of the German Reich, the\r\n    autonomous development of their national life in accordance with\r\n    their special characteristics. In witness whereof this document\r\n    is signed in duplicate.” (_TC-49_)\r\n\r\nHitler’s proclamation to the German people, dated 15 March 1939, reads\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “Proclamation of the Fuehrer to the German people, 15 March\r\n    1939.\r\n\r\n    “To the German People:\r\n\r\n    “Only a few months ago Germany was compelled to protect her\r\n    fellow-countrymen, living in well-defined settlements, against\r\n    the unbearable Czechoslovakian terror regime; and during the\r\n    last weeks the same thing has happened on an ever-increasing\r\n    scale. This is bound to create an intolerable state of affairs\r\n    within an area inhabited by citizens of so many nationalities.\r\n\r\n    “These national groups, to counteract the renewed attacks\r\n    against their freedom and life, have now broken away from the\r\n    Prague Government. Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n    “Since Sunday at many places wild excesses have broken out,\r\n    amongst the victims of which are again many Germans. Hourly the\r\n    number of oppressed and persecuted people crying for help is\r\n    increasing. From areas thickly populated by German-speaking\r\n    inhabitants, which last autumn Czechoslovakia was allowed by\r\n    German generosity to retain, refugees robbed of their personal\r\n    belongings are streaming into the Reich.\r\n\r\n    “Continuation of such a state of affairs would lead to the\r\n    destruction of every vestige of order in an area in which\r\n    Germany is vitally interested particularly as for over one\r\n    thousand years it formed a part of the German Reich.\r\n\r\n    “In order definitely to remove this menace to peace and to\r\n    create the conditions for a necessary new order in this living\r\n    space, I have today resolved to allow German troops to march\r\n    into Bohemia and Moravia. They will disarm the terror gangs and\r\n    the Czechoslovakian forces supporting them, and protect the\r\n    lives of all who are menaced. Thus they will lay the foundations\r\n    for introducing a fundamental reordering of affairs which will\r\n    be in accordance with the 1,000-year old history and will\r\n    satisfy the practical needs of the German and Czech peoples”.\r\n    (_TC-50_)\r\n\r\nA footnote contains an order of the Fuehrer to the German armed forces\r\nof the same date, in which they are told to march in to safeguard lives\r\nand property of all inhabitants and not to conduct themselves as\r\nenemies, but as an instrument for carrying out the German Reich\r\nGovernment’s decision. (_TC-50_)\r\n\r\nNext came the decree establishing the Protectorate of Bohemia and\r\nMoravia. (_TC-51_)\r\n\r\nIn a communication from Foreign Minister Halifax to Sir Neville\r\nHenderson, British Ambassador in Berlin, the British Government\r\nprotested against these actions:\r\n\r\n    “Foreign Office, March 17, 1939:\r\n\r\n    “Please inform German Government that His Majesty’s Government\r\n    desire to make it plain to them that they cannot but regard the\r\n    events of the past few days as a complete repudiation of the\r\n    Munich Agreement and a denial of the spirit in which the\r\n    negotiators of that Agreement bound themselves to cooperate for\r\n    a peaceful settlement.\r\n\r\n    “His Majesty’s Government must also take this occasion to\r\n    protest against the changes effected in Czechoslovakia by German\r\n    military action, which are, in their view, devoid of any basis\r\n    of legality.” (_TC-52_)\r\n\r\nThe French Government also made a protest on the same date:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The French Ambassador has the honor to inform the\r\n    Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Reich of the formal protest\r\n    made by the Government of the French Republic against the\r\n    measures which the communication of Count de Welzeck records.\r\n\r\n    “The Government of the Republic consider, in fact, that in face\r\n    of the action directed by the German Government against\r\n    Czechoslovakia, they are confronted with a flagrant violation of\r\n    the letter and the spirit of the agreement signed at Munich on\r\n    September 9, 1938.\r\n\r\n    “The circumstances in which the agreements of March 15 have been\r\n    imposed on the leaders of the Czechoslovak Republic do not, in\r\n    the eyes of the Government of the Republic, legalize the\r\n    situation registered in that agreement.\r\n\r\n    “The French Ambassador has the honor to inform His Excellency,\r\n    the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Reich, that the\r\n    Government of the Republic can not recognize under these\r\n    conditions the legality of the new situation created in\r\n    Czechoslovakia by the action of the German Reich.” (_TC-53_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Armament Limitations._ Part V of the Treaty, containing Military,\r\nNaval and Air Clauses reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In order to render possible the initiation of a general\r\n    limitation of the armaments of all nations, Germany undertakes\r\n    strictly to observe the military, naval and air clauses which\r\n    follow.\r\n\r\n    “Section 1. Military Clauses. Effectives and Cadres of the\r\n    German Army * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Article 159.

By a date which must not be later than March 31,\r\n    1920, the German Army must not comprise more than seven\r\n    divisions of infantry and three divisions of cavalry.\r\n\r\n    “After that date, the total number of effectives in the army of\r\n    the States constituting Germany must not exceed 100,000 men,\r\n    including officers and establishments of depots. The army shall\r\n    be devoted exclusively to the maintenance of order within the\r\n    territory and to the control of the frontier.\r\n\r\n    “The total effective strength of officers, including the\r\n    personnel of staffs, whatever their composition, must not exceed\r\n    4,000.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    (2) “Divisions and Army Corps headquarters staffs, shall be\r\n    organized in accordance with Table Number 1 annexed to this\r\n    Section.

(_TC-10_)\r\n\r\nArticle 168 reads:\r\n\r\n    “The manufacture of arms, munitions or any war material shall\r\n    only be carried out in factories or works, the location of which\r\n    shall be communicated to and approved by the governments of the\r\n    Principal Allied and Associated Powers, and the number of which\r\n    they retain the right to restrict. * * *” (_TC-10_)\r\n\r\nArticle 173, under the heading “Recruiting and Military Training”, deals\r\nwith one matter, the breach of which is of great importance:\r\n\r\n    “Universal compulsory military service shall be abolished in\r\n    Germany. The German Army may only be reconstituted and recruited\r\n    by means of voluntary enlistment.” (_TC-10_)\r\n\r\nThe succeeding articles deal with the method of enlistment in order to\r\nprevent a quick rush through the army of men enlisted for a short time.\r\n\r\nArticle 180 provides:\r\n\r\n    “All fortified works, fortresses and field works situated in\r\n    German territory to the west of a line drawn 50 kilometers to\r\n    the east of the Rhine shall be disarmed and dismantled. * * *”\r\n    (_TC-10_)\r\n\r\nArticle 181 contains naval limitations:\r\n\r\n    “After a period of two months from the coming into force of the\r\n    present Treaty the German naval forces in commission must not\r\n    exceed:\r\n\r\n    Six battleships of the Deutschland or Lothringen type\r\n\r\n    Six light cruisers\r\n\r\n    Twelve destroyers\r\n\r\n    Twelve torpedo boats\r\n\r\n    or an equal number of ships constructed to replace them as\r\n    provided in Article 190.\r\n\r\n    “No submarines are to be included.\r\n\r\n    “All other warships, except where there is provision to the\r\n    contrary in the present Treaty, must be placed in reserve or\r\n    devoted to commercial purposes.” (_TC-10_)\r\n\r\nArticle 183 limits naval personnel to fifteen thousand, including\r\nofficers and men of all grades and corps.\r\n\r\nArticle 191 provides:\r\n\r\n    “The construction or acquisition of any submarines, even for\r\n    commercial purposes, shall be forbidden in Germany.” (_TC-10_)\r\n\r\nArticle 198, the first of the Air Clauses, commences:\r\n\r\n    “The armed forces of Germany must not include any military or\r\n    naval air forces.” (_TC-10_)\r\n\r\nThe formal statement made at the German Air Ministry about the\r\nreinauguration of the Air Corps is reproduced in _TC-44_. The public\r\nproclamation of compulsory military service is contained in _TC-45_.\r\n\r\nF. _Treaty between the United States and Germany Restoring Friendly\r\nRelations._\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this treaty (_TC-11_) was to complete the official\r\ncessation of hostilities between the United States of America and\r\nGermany; it also incorporated certain parts of the Treaty of Versailles.\r\nThe relevant portion is Part 5, which repeats the clauses of the Treaty\r\nof Versailles which have been discussed immediately above.\r\n\r\nG. _Treaty of Mutual Guarantee between Germany, Belgium, France, Great\r\nBritain, and Italy, done at Locarno, 16 October 1925._\r\n\r\nSeveral treaties were negotiated at Locarno; they all go together and\r\nare to a certain extent mutually dependent. At Locarno, Germany\r\nnegotiated five treaties: (_a_) the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee between\r\nGermany, Belgium, France, Great Britain, and Italy (_TC-12_); (_b_) the\r\nArbitration Convention between Germany and France; (_c_) the Arbitration\r\nConvention between Germany and Belgium; (_d_) the Arbitration Treaty\r\nbetween Germany and Poland; and (_e_) an Arbitration Treaty between\r\nGermany and Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nArticle 10 of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee (_TC-12_) provided that it\r\nshould come into force as soon as ratifications were deposited at Geneva\r\nin the archives of the League of Nations, and as soon as Germany became\r\na member of the League of Nations. The ratifications were deposited on\r\n14 September 1926, and Germany became a member of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe two arbitration conventions and the two arbitration treaties\r\nprovided that they shall enter into force under the same conditions as\r\nthe Treaty of Mutual Guarantee. (Article 21 of the arbitration\r\nconventions and Article 22 of the arbitration treaties.)\r\n\r\nThe most important of the five agreements is the Treaty of Mutual\r\nGuarantee (_TC-12_). One of the purposes was to establish in perpetuity\r\nthe borders between Germany and Belgium, and Germany and France. It\r\ncontains no provision for denunciation or withdrawal therefrom and\r\nprovides that it shall remain in force until the Council of the League\r\nof Nations decides that the League of Nations ensures sufficient\r\nprotection to the parties to the Treaty—an event which never happened\r\nin which case the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee shall expire one year\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe general scheme of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee is that Article 1\r\nprovides that the parties guarantee three things: the border between\r\nGermany and France, the border between Germany and Belgium, and the\r\ndemilitarization of the Rhineland.\r\n\r\nArticle 2 provides that Germany and France, and Germany and Belgium\r\nagree that they will not attack or invade each other, with certain\r\ninapplicable exceptions; and Article 3 provides that Germany and France,\r\nand Germany and Belgium agree to settle all disputes between them by\r\npeaceful means. (_TC-12_)\r\n\r\nThe first important violation of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee appears\r\nto have been the entry of German troops into the Rhineland on 7 March\r\n1936. The day after, France and Belgium asked the League of Nations\r\nCouncil to consider the question of the German reoccupation of the\r\nRhineland and the purported repudiation of the treaty. On 12 March,\r\nafter a protest from the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Belgium,\r\nFrance, Great Britain, and Italy recognized unanimously that the\r\nreoccupation was a violation of this treaty. On 14 March, the League\r\nCouncil duly and properly decided that reoccupation was not permissible\r\nand that the Rhineland clauses of the pact were not voidable by Germany\r\nbecause of the alleged violation by France in the Franco-Soviet Mutual\r\nAssistance Pact.\r\n\r\nThat is the background to the treaty. The relevant articles are 1, 2,\r\nand 3, already mentioned; 4, which provides for the bringing of\r\nviolations before the Council of the League, as was done; and 5, which\r\ndeals with the clauses of the Versailles Treaty already mentioned. It\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n    “The provisions of Article 3 of the present Treaty are placed\r\n    under the guarantee of the High Contracting Parties as provided\r\n    by the following stipulations:\r\n\r\n    “If one of the Powers referred to in Article 3 refuses to submit\r\n    a dispute to peaceful settlement or to comply with an arbitral\r\n    or judicial decision and commits a violation of Article 2 of the\r\n    present Treaty or a breach of Article 42 or 43 of the Treaty of\r\n    Versailles, the provisions of Article 4 of the present Treaty\r\n    shall apply.” (_TC-12_)\r\n\r\nThat is the procedure requiring reference to the League in the case of a\r\nflagrant breach or of more stringent action.\r\n\r\nIt may be recalled that Hitler had promised that the German Government\r\nwould scrupulously maintain their treaties voluntarily signed, even\r\nthough they were concluded before Hitler’s accession to power. No one\r\nhas ever argued that Stresemann was in any way acting involuntarily when\r\nhe signed this Locarno Pact on behalf of Germany, along with the other\r\nrepresentatives. (The signature is not in Stresemann’s name, but by Herr\r\nHans Luther.) This treaty, which repeats the violated provisions of the\r\nVersailles Treaty, was freely entered into and binds Germany in that\r\nregard. Article 8 deals with the preliminary enforcement of the Treaty\r\nby the League:\r\n\r\n    “The present Treaty shall be registered at the League of Nations\r\n    in accordance with the Covenant of the League. It shall remain\r\n    in force until the Council, acting on a request of one or other\r\n    of the High Contracting Parties notified to the other signatory\r\n    Powers three months in advance, and voting at least by a\r\n    two-thirds majority, decides that the League of Nations ensures\r\n    sufficient protection to the High Contracting Parties; the\r\n    Treaty shall cease to have effect on the expiration of a period\r\n    of one year from such decision.” (_TC-12_)\r\n\r\nThus, in signing this Treaty, the German representative clearly placed\r\nthe question of repudiation or violation of the Treaty in the hands of\r\nothers. Germany was at the time a member of the League, and a member in\r\nthe Council of the League. Germany left the question of repudiation or\r\nviolations to the decision of the League.\r\n\r\nH. _Arbitration Treaty between Germany and Czechoslovakia, signed at\r\nLocarno in October 1925._\r\n\r\nArticle I is the governing clause of this treaty (_TC-14_). It provides:\r\n\r\n    “All disputes of every kind between Germany and Czechoslovakia\r\n    with regard to which the Parties are in conflict as to their\r\n    respective rights, and which it may not be possible to settle\r\n    amicably by the normal methods of diplomacy, shall be submitted\r\n    for decision either to an arbitral tribunal, or to the Permanent\r\n    Court of International Justice as laid down hereafter. It is\r\n    agreed that the disputes referred to above include, in\r\n    particular, those mentioned in Article 13 of the Covenant of the\r\n    League of Nations. This provision does not apply to disputes\r\n    arising out of or prior to the present Treaty and belonging to\r\n    the past. Disputes for the settlement of which a special\r\n    procedure is laid down on other conventions in force between the\r\n    High Contracting Parties, shall be settled in conformity with\r\n    the provisions of those Conventions.”\r\n\r\nThis treaty was registered with the Secretariat of the League in\r\naccordance with Article 22, the second sentence of which shows that the\r\nTreaty was entered into and its terms in force under the same conditions\r\nas the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee. (_TC-12_)\r\n\r\nThis is the Treaty to which President Benes unsuccessfully appealed\r\nduring the crisis in the Autumn of 1938.\r\n\r\nI. _Arbitration Convention Between Germany and Belgium, signed at\r\nLocarno, October 1925._\r\n\r\n(This treaty, _TC-13_, is discussed in Section 10 of this chapter\r\ndealing with the invasion of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.)\r\n\r\nJ. _Arbitration Treaty Between Germany and Poland, signed at Locarno, 16\r\nOctober 1925._\r\n\r\n(This treaty, _TC-15_, is discussed in Section 8 of this chapter dealing\r\nwith the invasion of Poland.)\r\n\r\nK. _Declaration of the Assembly of the League of Nations of 24 September\r\n1927._\r\n\r\nGermany had become a member of the League of Nations on 10 September\r\n1926, a year before this Declaration was made.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this Declaration is not only its effect on\r\nInternational Law, but to the fact that it was unanimously adopted by\r\nthe Assembly of the League of Nations, of which Germany was a free and\r\nactive member at the time. Referring to the unanimous adoption of the\r\nDeclaration, M. Sokal, the Polish Rapporteur, had this to say:\r\n\r\n    “The Committee was of opinion that, at the present juncture, a\r\n    solemn resolution passed by the Assembly, declaring that wars of\r\n    aggression must never be employed as a means of settling\r\n    disputes between States, and that such wars constitute an\r\n    international crime, would have a salutary effect on public\r\n    opinion, and would help to create an atmosphere favorable to the\r\n    League’s future work in the matter of security and disarmament.\r\n\r\n    “While recognizing that the draft resolution does not constitute\r\n    a regular legal instrument, which would be adequate in itself\r\n    and represent a concrete contribution towards security, the\r\n    Third Committee unanimously agreed as to its great moral and\r\n    educative value.” (_TC-18_)\r\n\r\nM. Sokal then asked the Assembly to adopt the draft resolution, the\r\nterms of which show what so many nations, including Germany, had in mind\r\nat that time. The resolution recited that the Assembly—\r\n\r\n    “* * * recognizing the solidarity which unites the community of\r\n    nations, being inspired by a firm desire for the maintenance of\r\n    general peace, being convinced that a war of aggression can\r\n    never serve as a means of settling international disputes, and\r\n    in consequence an international crime; considering that the\r\n    solemn renunciation of all wars of aggression would tend to\r\n    create an atmosphere of general confidence calculated to\r\n    facilitate the progress of the work undertaken with a view to\r\n    disarmament:\r\n\r\n    “Declares: 1. That all wars of aggression are and shall always\r\n    be prohibited.\r\n\r\n    “2. That every pacific means must be employed to settle disputes\r\n    of every description, which may arise between States.\r\n\r\n    “That the Assembly declares that the States Members of the\r\n    League are under an obligation to conform to these principles.”\r\n    (_TC-18_)\r\n\r\nThe fact of the solemn renunciation of war was taken in the form of a\r\nroll call, and the President announced that:\r\n\r\n    “All the delegations having pronounced in favour of the\r\n    declaration submitted by the Third Committee, I declare it\r\n    unanimously adopted.” (_TC-18_)\r\n\r\nL. _The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928._\r\n\r\n(This treaty, _TC-19_, is discussed in Sir Hartley Shawcross’s opening\r\naddress for Great Britain, to be found in Section 5, _supra_.)\r\n\r\nM. _Assurances._\r\n\r\n(1) _Austria._ On 21 May 1935 Hitler made a speech containing this\r\nassurance:\r\n\r\n    “Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the domestic\r\n    affairs of Austria, to annex Austria, or to attach that country\r\n    to her. The German people and the German Government have,\r\n    however, the very comprehensible desire, arising out of the\r\n    simple feeling of solidarity due to a common national descent,\r\n    that the right to self-determination should be guaranteed not\r\n    only to foreign nations, but to the German people everywhere.\r\n\r\n    “I myself believe that no regime which is not anchored in the\r\n    people, supported by the people, and desired by the people, can\r\n    exist permanently.” (_TC-26_)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the Agreement between the German Government and the\r\nGovernment of the Federal State of Austria, on July 11, 1936, paragraph\r\none stated as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The German Government recognizes the full sovereignty of the\r\n    Federal State of Austria in the sense of the pronouncements of\r\n    the German Leader and Chancellor of the 21st May, 1935.”\r\n    (_TC-22_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Czechoslovakia._ The German Assurance to Czechoslovakia is\r\ncontained in the letter from M. Jan Masaryk to Viscount Halifax on the\r\ndate of 12 March 1938 (_TC-27_). The first paragraph shows that Field\r\nMarshall Goering used the expression “_Ich gebe Ihnen Mein Ehrenwort_.”\r\nThat means, “I give my word of honor.” The third paragraph shows that\r\nGoering had asked that there would not be a mobilization of the\r\nCzechoslovak Army. The fourth paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n    “M. Mastny was in a position to give him definite and binding\r\n    assurances on this subject, and today he spoke with Baron von\r\n    Neurath, who, among other things, assured him on behalf of Herr\r\n    Hitler that Germany still considers herself bound by the\r\n    German-Czechoslovak Arbitration Convention concluded at Locarno\r\n    in October 1925.” (_TC-27_)\r\n\r\nSo that in 1935 Baron von Neurath was speaking on behalf of Germany on\r\nan agreement voluntarily concluded. Had there been the slightest doubt\r\nof that question, von Neurath gave the assurance on behalf of Hitler\r\nthat Germany still considered itself bound by the German-Czechoslovakia\r\nArbitration Convention on the 12 March 1938, six months before Dr. Benes\r\nmade a hopeless appeal to it before the crisis in the Army in 1938.\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia’s difficult position is set out in the pregnant last\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n    “They can not however fail to view with great apprehension the\r\n    sequel of events in Austria between the date of the bi-lateral\r\n    agreement between Germany and Austria, 11 July 1936, and\r\n    yesterday, 11 March 1938.” (_TC-27_)\r\n\r\nOn 26 September 1938, Hitler made an assurance to Czechoslovakia which\r\ncontains important points as to the alleged German policy of getting\r\nGermans together in the Reich, for which the Nazi conspirators had\r\npurported to request a considerable time:\r\n\r\n    “I have a little to explain. I am grateful to Mr. Chamberlain\r\n    for all his efforts, and I have assured him that the German\r\n    people want nothing but peace; but I have also told him that I\r\n    can not go back beyond the limits of our patience.” (_TC-28_)\r\n\r\n(This occurred between the Godesberg Treaty and the Munich Pact).\r\n\r\n    “I assured him, moreover, and I repeat it here, that when this\r\n    problem is solved there will be no more territorial problems for\r\n    Germany in Europe. And I further assured him that from the\r\n    moment when Czechoslovakia solves its other problems, that is to\r\n    say, when the Czechs have come to an arrangement with their\r\n    other minorities peacefully, and without oppression, I will no\r\n    longer be interested in the Czech State. And that, as far as I\r\n    am concerned, I will guarantee it. We don’t want any Czechs. But\r\n    I must also declare before the German people that in the\r\n    Sudeten-German problem my patience is now at an end. I made an\r\n    offer to Herr Benes which was no more than the realization of\r\n    what he had already promised. He now has peace or war in his\r\n    hands. Either he will accept this offer and at length give the\r\n    Germans their freedom, or we will get this freedom for\r\n    ourselves.” (_TC-28_)\r\n\r\nThe Munich Agreement of 29 September 1938 (_TC-23_) was signed by\r\nHitler, later by Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Daladier, and Mussolini. It is\r\nlargely a procedural agreement by which the entry of German troops into\r\nSudeten-Deutsche territory is regulated. That is shown by the\r\npreliminary clause:\r\n\r\n    “Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, taking into\r\n    consideration the agreement which has been already reached in\r\n    principle for the cession to Germany of the Sudeten-German\r\n    territory have agreed on the following terms and conditions\r\n    governing the said cession and the measures consequent thereon,\r\n    and by this agreement they each hold themselves responsible for\r\n    the steps necessary to secure fulfillment.” (_TC-23_)\r\n\r\nArticle 4 states that “The occupation by stages of the predominantly\r\nGerman territory by German troops will begin on 1 October.” The four\r\nterritories are marked on the attached map. Article 6 provides that “The\r\nfinal determination of the frontiers will be carried out by the\r\ninternational commission.” (_TC-23_)\r\n\r\nThe agreement provides also for various rights of option and release\r\nfrom the Czech forces of Sudeten-Germans (TC-23). That was what Hitler\r\nwas asking for in the somewhat rhetorical passage previously referred to\r\n(_TC-28_).\r\n\r\nThere is an annex to the Munich Agreement which is most significant:\r\n\r\n    “Annex to the Agreement:\r\n\r\n    “His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the French\r\n    Government have entered into the above Agreement on the basis\r\n    that they stand by the offer contained in Paragraph 6 of the\r\n    Anglo-French Proposal of the 19th September, relating to an\r\n    international guarantee of the new boundaries of the\r\n    Czechoslovak State against unprovoked aggression.\r\n\r\n    “When the question of the Polish and Hungarian minorities in\r\n    Czechoslovakia has been settled Germany and Italy, for their\r\n    part, will give a guarantee to Czechoslovakia.” (_TC-23_)\r\n\r\nThe provision concerns “the Polish and Hungarian minorities,” not the\r\nquestion of Slovakia. That is why that the German action of the 15th of\r\nMarch was a flagrant violation of the letter and spirit of that\r\nAgreement.

AGGRESSION AGAINST POLAND, DANZIG, ENGLAND\r\n                               AND FRANCE\r\n\r\nA. _Treaties Breached._\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general treaties involved—The Hague Convention in\r\nrespect of the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes (_TC-2_);\r\nother Hague Conventions of 1907 (_TC-3_; _TC-4_); the Versailles Treaty\r\n(_TC-9_) in respect of the Free City of Danzig; and the Kellogg-Briand\r\nPact (_TC-19_)—two specific agreements were violated by the German\r\nattack on Poland. These were the Arbitration Treaty between Germany and\r\nPoland, signed at Locarno on 16 October 1925, and the Declaration of\r\nNon-Aggression which was entered into between Germany and Poland on 26\r\nJanuary 1934.\r\n\r\nThe German-Polish Arbitration Treaty (_TC-15_) declares in the preamble\r\nand Articles 1 and 2:\r\n\r\n    “The President of the German Empire and the President of the\r\n    Polish Republic:\r\n\r\n    “Equally resolved to maintain peace between Germany and Poland\r\n    by assuring the peaceful settlement of differences which might\r\n    arise between the two countries;\r\n\r\n    “Declaring that respect for the rights established by treaty or\r\n    resulting from the law of nations is obligatory for\r\n    international tribunals;\r\n\r\n    “Agreeing to recognize that the rights of a State cannot be\r\n    modified save with its consent;\r\n\r\n    “And considering that sincere observance of the methods of\r\n    peaceful settlement of international disputes permits of\r\n    resolving, without recourse to force, questions which may become\r\n    the cause of division between States;\r\n\r\n    “Have decided . . .”\r\n\r\n    “Article 1: All disputes of every kind between Germany and\r\n    Poland with regard to which the Parties are in conflict as to\r\n    their respective rights, and which it may not be possible to\r\n    settle amicably by the normal methods of diplomacy, shall be\r\n    submitted for decision either to an arbitral tribunal or to the\r\n    Permanent Court of International Justice, as laid down\r\n    hereafter.”\r\n\r\n    “Article 2: Before any resort is made to arbitral procedure\r\n    before the Permanent Court of International Justice, the dispute\r\n    may, by agreement between the Parties, be submitted, with a view\r\n    to amicable settlement, to a permanent international commission,\r\n    styled the Permanent Conciliation Commission, constituted in\r\n    accordance with the present Treaty.” (_TC-15_)\r\n\r\nThereafter the treaty goes on to lay down the procedure for arbitration\r\nand for conciliation. Germany, however, in September 1939 attacked and\r\ninvaded Poland without having first attempted to settle its disputes\r\nwith Poland by peaceful means.\r\n\r\nThe second specific treaty, the German-Polish Declaration of 26 January\r\n1934, reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “The German Government and the Polish Government consider that\r\n    the time has come to introduce a new era in the political\r\n    relations between Germany and Poland by a direct understanding\r\n    between the States. They have therefore decided to establish by\r\n    the present declaration a basis for the future shaping of those\r\n    relations.\r\n\r\n    “The two Governments assume that the maintenance and assurance\r\n    of a permanent peace between their countries is an essential\r\n    condition for general peace in Europe.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The declaration shall remain in effect for a period of ten\r\n    years counting from the day of exchange of instruments of\r\n    ratification. In case it is not denounced by one of the two\r\n    governments six months before the expiration of that period of\r\n    time, it shall continue in effect but can then be denounced by\r\n    either government at a time of six months and at any time in\r\n    advance.” (TC-21)\r\n\r\nB. _German Intentions Before March 1939._\r\n\r\nIt has been previously shown that the actions against Austria and\r\nCzechoslovakia were in themselves part of the preparation for further\r\naggression. Even at that time, before the Germans had seized the whole\r\nof Czechoslovakia, they were perfectly prepared to fight England,\r\nPoland, and France, if necessary, to achieve those aims. They\r\nappreciated the whole time that they might well have to do so.\r\nFurthermore, although not until after March 1939, did they commence upon\r\ntheir immediate and specific preparations for a specific war against\r\nPoland, nevertheless, they had for a considerable time before had it in\r\nmind specifically to attack Poland once Czechoslovakia was completely\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nDuring this period also—and this happens throughout the whole story of\r\nthe Nazi regime in Germany—as afterwards, while they were making their\r\npreparations and carrying out their plans, they were giving to the\r\noutside world assurance after assurance so as to lull them out of any\r\nsuspicion of their real object.\r\n\r\nWhen the agreement with Poland was signed in January 1934, Hitler had\r\nthis to say:\r\n\r\n    “When I took over the Government on the 30th of January, the\r\n    relations between the two countries seemed to me more than\r\n    unsatisfactory. There was a danger that the existing differences\r\n    which were due to the Territorial Clauses of the Treaty of\r\n    Versailles and the mutual tension resulting therefrom would\r\n    gradually crystalize into a state of hostility which, if\r\n    persisted, might too easily acquire the character of a dangerous\r\n    traditional enmity.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the spirit of this Treaty the German Government is willing\r\n    and prepared to cultivate economic relations with Poland in such\r\n    a way that here, too, the state of unprofitable suspicion can be\r\n    succeeded by a period of useful cooperation. It is a matter of\r\n    particular satisfaction to us that in this same year the\r\n    National Socialist Government of Danzig has been enabled to\r\n    effect a similar clarification of its relations with its Polish\r\n    neighbor.” (_TC-70_)\r\n\r\nThat was in 1934. Three years later, again on 30 January, speaking in\r\nthe Reichstag, Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “By a series of agreements we have eliminated existing tension\r\n    and thereby contributed considerably to an improvement in the\r\n    European atmosphere. I merely recall an agreement with Poland\r\n    which has worked out to the advantage of both sides. True\r\n    statesmanship will not overlook reality but consider them. The\r\n    Italian nation and the new Italian state are realities. The\r\n    German nation and the German Reich are equally realities, and to\r\n    my own fellow citizens I would say that the Polish nation and\r\n    the Polish state have also become a reality.” (_2868-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat was on 30 January 1937.\r\n\r\nOn 24 June 1937, a “Top Secret Order (_C-175_) was issued by the Reich\r\nMinister for War and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, signed “Von\r\nBlomberg”. There is the notation at the top, “Written by an Officer.\r\nOutgoing documents in connection with this matter and dealing with it in\r\nprinciple are to be written by an officer.” With it is enclosed a\r\nDirective for the Unified Preparation for War of the Armed Forces, to\r\ncome into force on 1 August 1937. The enclosed directive is divided into\r\nPart 1, “General Guiding Principle”; Part 2, “Likely Warlike\r\nEventualities”; Part 3, “Special Preparations”. The substance of the\r\ndocument justifies the supposition that Germany need not consider an\r\nattack from any side.\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The intention to unleash a European war is held just as\r\n    little by Germany. Nevertheless, the politically fluid world\r\n    situation, which does not preclude surprising incidents, demands\r\n    a continuous preparedness for war of the German Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n    “To counter attacks at any time, and to enable the military\r\n    exploitation of politically favorable opportunities should they\r\n    occur.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nThe preparations which are to be made are then set forth:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The further working on mobilization without public\r\n    announcement in order to put the Armed Forces in a position to\r\n    begin a war suddenly and by surprise both as regards strength\r\n    and time.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Special preparations are to be made for the following\r\n    eventualities: Armed intervention against Austria; warlike\r\n    entanglement with Red Spain.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nAnother passage shows clearly how they appreciated at that time that\r\ntheir actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia might well involve them\r\nin war.\r\n\r\n    “* * * England, Poland, Lithuania take part in a war against\r\n    us.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nPart 2 of this directive, dealing with “Probable warlike\r\neventualities—Concentrations,” states:\r\n\r\n    “1. War on two fronts with focal point in the West.\r\n\r\n    “Suppositions. In the West France is the opponent. Belgium may\r\n    side with France, either at once or later or not at all. It is\r\n    also possible that France may violate Belgium’s neutrality if\r\n    the latter is neutral. She will certainly violate that of\r\n    Luxembourg.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nPart 3, which deals in part with “Special Case—Extension Red-Green,”\r\ndeclares:\r\n\r\n    “The military political starting point used as a basis for\r\n    concentration plans Red and Green can be aggravated if either\r\n    England, Poland or Lithuania join on the side of our opponents.\r\n    Thereupon our military position would be worsened to an\r\n    unbearable, even hopeless, extent. The political leaders will\r\n    therefore do everything to keep these countries neutral, above\r\n    all England and Poland.” (_C-175_)\r\n\r\nThe date of this order is June 1937, and it seems clear that at that\r\ndate, anyway, the Nazi Government appreciated the likelihood, if not the\r\nprobability, of fighting England and Poland and France, and were\r\nprepared to do so. On 5 November 1937, Hitler held his conference in the\r\nReichschancellery, the minutes of which, referred to as the Hossbach\r\nnotes, contain the remarks made by Hitler in respect of England, Poland,\r\nand France:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer then stated: ‘The aim of German policy is the\r\n    security and preservation of the nation and its propagation.\r\n    This is consequently a problem of space’.” (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler then went on to discuss what he described as “participation in\r\nworld economy”, and declared:\r\n\r\n    “The only way out, and one which may appear imaginary, is the\r\n    securing of greater living space, an endeavor which at all times\r\n    has been the cause of the formation of states and movements of\r\n    nations.” (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The history of all times, Roman Empire, British Empire, has\r\n    proved that every space expansion can only be effected by\r\n    breaking resistance and taking risks. Even setbacks are\r\n    unavoidable. Neither formerly nor today has space been found\r\n    without an owner. The attacker always comes up against the\r\n    proprietor.” (_386-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn the same day as this Hossbach meeting in the Reichschancellery was\r\ntaking place, a communique was being issued as a result of the Polish\r\nambassador’s audience with Hitler (_TC-73 No. 33_). In the course of\r\nthis conversation, the communique stated:\r\n\r\n    “It was confirmed that Polish-German relations should not meet\r\n    with difficulty because of the Danzig question.” (_TC-73 No.\r\n    33_)\r\n\r\nOn 2 January 1938, some unknown person wrote a memorandum for the\r\nFuehrer. This document is headed, “Very Confidential—Personal Only”,\r\nand is entitled “Deduction on the report, German Embassy, London,\r\nregarding the future form of Anglo-German relations.” It states in part:\r\n\r\n    “With the realization that Germany will not tie herself to a\r\n    status quo in Central Europe, and that sooner or later a\r\n    military conflict in Europe is possible, the hope of an\r\n    agreement will slowly disappear among Germanophile British\r\n    politicians, insofar as they are not merely playing a part that\r\n    has been given to them. Thus the fateful question arises: Will\r\n    Germany and England eventually be forced to drift into separate\r\n    camps and will they march against each other one day? To answer\r\n    this question, one must realize the following:\r\n\r\n    “Change of the status quo in the east in the German sense can\r\n    only be carried out by force. So long as France knows that\r\n    England, which so to speak has, taken on a guarantee to aid\r\n    France against Germany, is on her side, France’s fighting for\r\n    her eastern allies is probable in any case, always possible, and\r\n    thus with it war between Germany and England. This applies then\r\n    even if England does not want war. England, believing she must\r\n    attend her borders on the Rhine, would be dragged in\r\n    automatically by France. In other words, peace or war between\r\n    England and Germany rests solely in the hands of France, who\r\n    could bring about such a war between Germany and England by way\r\n    of a conflict between Germany and France. It follows therefore\r\n    that war between Germany and England on account of France can be\r\n    prevented only if France knows from the start that England’s\r\n    forces would not be sufficient to guarantee their common\r\n    victory. Such a situation might force England, and thereby\r\n    France, to accept a lot of things that a strong Anglo-France\r\n    coalition would never tolerate.\r\n\r\n    “This position would arise for instance if England, through\r\n    insufficient armament or as a result of threats to her empire by\r\n    a superior coalition of powers, e.g., Germany, Italy, Japan,\r\n    thereby tying down her military forces in other places, would\r\n    not be able to assure France of sufficient support in Europe:”\r\n\r\nThe writer goes on to discuss the possibility of a strong partnership\r\nbetween Italy and Japan, and then reaches a summary:\r\n\r\n    “Paragraph five: Therefore, conclusions to be drawn by us.\r\n\r\n    “1. Outwardly, further understanding with England in regard to\r\n    the protection of the interests of our friends.\r\n\r\n    “2. Formation under great secrecy, but with whole-hearted\r\n    tenacity of a coalition against England, that is to say, a\r\n    tightening of our friendship with Italy and Japan; also the\r\n    winning over of all nations whose interests conform with ours\r\n    directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n    “Close and confidential cooperation of the diplomats of the\r\n    three great powers towards this purpose. Only in this way can we\r\n    confront England be it in a settlement or in war. England is\r\n    going to be a hard, astute opponent in this game of diplomacy.\r\n\r\n    “The particular question whether in the event of a war by\r\n    Germany in central Europe France and thereby England would\r\n    interfere, depends on the circumstances and the time at which\r\n    such a war commences and ceases, and on military considerations\r\n    which cannot be gone into here.” (_TC-75_)\r\n\r\nWhoever it was who wrote that document, appears to have been on a fairly\r\nhigh level, because he concludes by saying, “I should like to give the\r\nFuehrer some of these viewpoints verbally.” (_TC-75_)\r\n\r\nOn 20 February 1938, Hitler spoke in the Reichstag. In that speech he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “In the fifth year following the first great foreign political\r\n    agreement with the Reich, it fills us with sincere gratification\r\n    to be able to state that in our relations with the state with\r\n    which we had had perhaps the greatest difference, not only has\r\n    there been a ‘detente,’ but in the course of the years there has\r\n    been a constant improvement in relations. This good work, which\r\n    was regarded with suspicion by so many at the time, has stood\r\n    the test, and I may say that since the League of Nations finally\r\n    gave up its continual attempts to unsettle Danzig and appointed\r\n    a man of great personal attainments as the new commissioner,\r\n    this most dangerous spot from the point of view of European\r\n    peace has entirely lost its menacing character. The Polish State\r\n    respects the national conditions in this state, and both the\r\n    city of Danzig and Germany respect Polish rights. And so the way\r\n    to an understanding has been successfully paved, an\r\n    understanding which beginning with Danzig has today, in spite of\r\n    the attempts of certain mischief-makers, succeeded in finally\r\n    taking the poison out of the relations between Germany and\r\n    Poland and transforming them into a sincere, friendly\r\n    cooperation.\r\n\r\n    “To rely on her friendships, Germany will not leave a stone\r\n    unturned to save that ideal which provides the foundation for\r\n    the task which is ahead of us—peace.” (_2357-PS_)\r\n\r\nA memorandum dated 2 May 1938, and entitled, “Organizational Study\r\n1950,” originated in the office of the Chief of the Organizational Staff\r\nof the General Staff of the Air Force. Its purpose was said to be: “The\r\ntask is to search, within a framework of very broadly-conceived\r\nconditions, for the most suitable type of organization of the Air\r\nForce.” (_L-43_). The result gained is termed, “Distant Objective.” From\r\nthis is deduced the goal to be reached in the second phase of the\r\nprocess, which is called, “Final Objective 1942.” This in turn yields\r\nwhat is considered the most suitable proposal for the reorganization of\r\nthe staffs of the Air Force Group Commands, Air Gaus, Air Divisions,\r\netc. (_L-43_)\r\n\r\nThe Table of Contents is divided into various sections. Section I is\r\nentitled, “Assumptions.” In connection with the heading “Assumption I,\r\nfrontier of Germany”, a map is enclosed (_Chart No. 10_). The map shows\r\nthat on 2 May 1938 the Air Force was in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nPoland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Hungary, all of which are shown as\r\nwithin the boundaries of the Reich.\r\n\r\nThe following is a pertinent extract from the memorandum:\r\n\r\n    “Consideration of the principles of organization on the basis of\r\n    the assumptions for war and peace made in Section 1:\r\n\r\n    “1. Attack Forces: Principal adversaries: England, France, and\r\n    Russia.” (_L-43_)\r\n\r\nThe study then goes on to show all the one hundred forty-four\r\n_Geschwader_ employed against England, very much concentrated in the\r\nWestern half of the Reich; that is to say, they must be deployed in such\r\na way that by making full use of their range, they can reach all English\r\nterritory down to the last corner. Under the paragraph “Assumption”\r\ndouble heading 2, the “Organization of Air Force in peacetime” is shown\r\nand seven group commands are indicated: (1) Berlin; (2) Brunswick; (3)\r\nMunich; (4) Vienna; (5) Budapest; (6) Warsaw; and (7) Koenigsberg.\r\n(_L-43_)\r\n\r\nFinally, the study declares:\r\n\r\n    “The more the Reich grows in area and the more the Air Force\r\n    grows in strength, the more imperative it becomes, to have\r\n    locally bound commands * * *” (_L-43_)\r\n\r\nThe original of this document is signed by an officer who is not at the\r\ntop rank in the German Air Force, and the inferences that can be drawn\r\nfrom it should therefore not be over-emphasized. At least, however, it\r\nshows the lines upon which the General Staff of the Air Force were\r\nthinking at that time.\r\n\r\nOn the 26 August 1938, when Ribbentrop had become Foreign Minister\r\nsucceeding von Neurath, a document was addressed to him as “The Reich\r\nMinister, via the State Secretary.” The document reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The most pressing problem of German policy, the Czech problem,\r\n    might easily, but must not lead to a conflict with the Entente.\r\n    Neither France nor England are looking for trouble regarding\r\n    Czechoslovakia. Both would perhaps leave Czechoslovakia to\r\n    herself, if she should, without direct foreign interference and\r\n    through internal signs of disintegration, due to her own faults,\r\n    suffer the fate she deserves. This process, however, would have\r\n    to take place step by step and would have to lead to a loss of\r\n    power in the remaining territory by means of a plebiscite and an\r\n    annexation of territory.\r\n\r\n    “The Czech problem is not yet politically acute enough for any\r\n    immediate action, which the Entente would watch inactively, and\r\n    not even if this action should come quickly and surprisingly.\r\n    Germany cannot fix any definite time and this fruit could be\r\n    plucked without too great a risk. She can only prepare the\r\n    desired developments.\r\n\r\n    “For this purpose the slogan emanating from England at present\r\n    of the right for autonomy of the Sudeten-Germans, which we have\r\n    intentionally not used up to now, is to be taken up gradually.\r\n    The international conviction that the choice of nationality was\r\n    being withheld from these Germans will do useful spadework,\r\n    notwithstanding the fact that the chemical process of\r\n    dissolution of the Czech form of states may or may not be\r\n    finally speeded up by the mechanical means as well. The fate of\r\n    the actual body of Czechoslovakia, however, would not as yet be\r\n    clearly decided by this, but would nevertheless be definitely\r\n    sealed.\r\n\r\n    “This method of approach towards Czechoslovakia is to be\r\n    recommended because of our relationship with Poland. It is\r\n    unavoidable that the German departure from the problems of\r\n    boundaries in the southeast and their transfer to the east and\r\n    northeast must make the Poles sit up. The fact [is] that after\r\n    the liquidation of the Czech question, it will be generally\r\n    assumed that Poland will be the next in turn.\r\n\r\n    “But the later this assumption sinks in in international\r\n    politics as a firm factor, the better. In this sense, however,\r\n    it is important for the time being, to carry on the German\r\n    policy, under the well known and proved slogans of ‘the right to\r\n    autonomy’ and ‘Racial unity’. Anything else might be interpreted\r\n    as pure imperialism on our part and create the resistance to our\r\n    plan by the Entente at an earlier date and more energetically,\r\n    than our forces could stand up to.” (_TC-76_)\r\n\r\nThat was on 26 August 1938, just as the Czech crisis was leading up to\r\nthe Munich settlement. While at Munich, a day or two before the Munich\r\nagreement was signed, Herr Hitler made a speech. On 26 September he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “I assured him, moreover, and I repeat it here, that when this\r\n    problem is solved there will be no more territorial problems for\r\n    Germany in Europe.” (_TC-29_)\r\n\r\nA letter from Admiral Carl, dated some time in September, with no\r\nprecise date, and entitled “Opinion on the ‘Draft Study of Naval Warfare\r\nagainst England’,” stated as follows:\r\n\r\n    “There is full agreement with the main theme of the study.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “If according to the Fuehrer’s decision Germany is to acquire a\r\n    position as a world power who needs not only sufficient colonial\r\n    possessions but also secure naval communications and secure\r\n    access to the ocean.” (_C-23_)\r\n\r\nThat, then, was the position at the time of the Munich agreement in\r\nSeptember 1938. The gains of Munich were not, of course, so great as the\r\nNazi Government had hoped and intended. As a result, the conspirators\r\nwere not prepared straight away to start any further aggressive action\r\nagainst Poland or elsewhere. But with the advantages that were gained by\r\nthe seizure of Czechoslovakia, it is obvious now that they intended and\r\nhad taken the decision to proceed against Poland so soon as\r\nCzechoslovakia had been entirely occupied. As Jodl and Hitler said on\r\nsubsequent occasions, Czechoslovakia was only setting the stage for the\r\nattack on Poland.\r\n\r\nIt is known now from what Hitler said in talking to his military\r\ncommanders at a later date, that, in his own words, from the first he\r\nnever intended to abide by the Munich agreement, but that he had to have\r\nthe whole of Czechoslovakia. As a result, although not ready to proceed\r\nin full force against Poland, after September 1938 they did at once\r\nbegin to approach the Poles on the question of Danzig until the whole of\r\nCzechoslovakia had been taken in March. Immediately after the\r\nSudetenland had been occupied, preliminary steps were taken to stir up\r\ntrouble with Poland, which would and was to eventually lead to the Nazi\r\nexcuse or justification for their attack on that country.\r\n\r\nThe earlier discussions between the German and Polish governments on the\r\nquestion of Danzig, which commenced almost immediately after the Munich\r\ncrisis in September 1938, began as cautious and friendly discussions,\r\nuntil the remainder of Czechoslovakia had finally been seized in March\r\nof the following year. A document taken from the Official Polish White\r\nBook, gives an account of a luncheon which took place at the Grand\r\nHotel, Berchtesgaden, on 25 October, where Ribbentrop had discussions\r\nwith M. Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany. The report states:\r\n\r\n    “In a conversation on 24 October, over a luncheon at the Grand\r\n    Hotel, Berchtesgaden, at which M. Hewel was present, M. von\r\n    Ribbentrop put forward a proposal for a general settlement of\r\n    issues (_Gesamtloesung_) between Poland and Germany. This\r\n    included the reunion of Danzig with the Reich, while Poland\r\n    would be assured the retention of railway and economic\r\n    facilities there. Poland would agree to the building of an\r\n    extra-territorial motor road and railway line across Pomorze. In\r\n    exchange M. von Ribbentrop mentioned the possibility of an\r\n    extension of the Polish-German Agreement by twenty-five years\r\n    and a guarantee of Polish-German frontiers.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Finally, I said that I wished to warn M. von Ribbentrop that I\r\n    could see no possibility of an agreement involving the reunion\r\n    of the Free City with the Reich. I concluded by promising to\r\n    communicate the substance of this conversation to you.” (_TC-73\r\n    No. 44_)\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that the whole question of Danzig, as indeed Hitler\r\nhimself said, was no question at all. Danzig was raised simply as an\r\nexcuse, a justification, not for the seizure of Danzig but for the\r\ninvasion and seizure of the whole of Poland. As the story unfolds it\r\nwill become ever more apparent that that is what the Nazi conspirators\r\nwere really aiming at, only providing themselves with some kind of\r\ncrisis which would afford some kind of justification for attacking\r\nPoland.\r\n\r\nAnother document taken from the Polish White Book (_TC-73 No. 45_) sets\r\nout the instructions that Mr. Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, gave to\r\nMr. Lipski to hand to the German government in reply to the suggestions\r\nput forward by Ribbentrop at Berchtesgaden on 24 October. The first part\r\nreviews the history of Polish-German relationship and emphasizes the\r\nneeds of Poland in respect to Danzig. Paragraph 6 of the document\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “In the circumstances, in the understanding of the Polish\r\n    government, the Danzig question is governed by two factors: the\r\n    right of the German population of the city and the surrounding\r\n    villages to freedom of life and development; and the fact that\r\n    in all matters appertaining to the Free City as a port it is\r\n    connected with Poland. Apart from the national character of the\r\n    majority of the population, everything in Danzig is definitely\r\n    bound up with Poland.” (_TC-73 No. 45_)\r\n\r\nThe document then sets out the guarantees to Poland under the statute,\r\nand continues as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Taking all the foregoing factors into consideration, and\r\n    desiring to achieve the stabilization of relations by way of a\r\n    friendly understanding with the government of the German Reich,\r\n    the Polish government proposes the replacement of the League of\r\n    Nations guarantee and its prerogatives by a bi-lateral\r\n    Polish-German Agreement. This agreement should guarantee the\r\n    existence of the Free City of Danzig so as to assure freedom of\r\n    national and cultural life to its German majority, and also\r\n    should guarantee all Polish rights. Notwithstanding the\r\n    complications involved in such a system, the Polish government\r\n    must state that any other solution, and in particular any\r\n    attempt to incorporate the Free City into the Reich, must\r\n    inevitably lead to a conflict. This would not only take the form\r\n    of local difficulties, but also would suspend all possibility of\r\n    Polish-German understanding in all its aspects.\r\n\r\n    “In face of the weight and cogency of these questions, I am\r\n    ready to have final conversations personally with the governing\r\n    circles of the Reich. I deem it necessary, however, that you\r\n    should first present the principles to which we adhere, so that\r\n    my eventual contact should not end in a breakdown, which would\r\n    be dangerous for the future.” (_TC-73 No. 45_)\r\n\r\nThe first stage in those negotiations had been entirely successful from\r\nthe German point of view. The Nazis had put forward a proposal, the\r\nreturn of the City of Danzig to the Reich, which they might well have\r\nknown would have been unacceptable. It was unacceptable and the Polish\r\ngovernment had warned the Nazi government that it would be. The Poles\r\nhad offered to enter into negotiations, but they had not agreed, which\r\nis exactly what the German government had hoped for. They had not agreed\r\nto the return of Danzig to the Reich. The first stage in producing the\r\ncrisis had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, within a week or so, and after the Polish government\r\nhad offered to enter into discussions with the German government,\r\nanother top secret order was issued by the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\nForces, signed by Keitel (_C-137_). Copies went to the OKH, OKM, and\r\nOKW. The order is headed “First Supplement to Instruction dated 21\r\nOctober 1938,” and reads:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has ordered: Apart from the three contingencies\r\n    mentioned in the instructions of 21 October 1938, preparations\r\n    are also to be made to enable the Free State of Danzig to be\r\n    occupied by German troops by surprise.\r\n\r\n    “The preparations will be made on the following basis: Condition\r\n    is _quasi-revolutionary_ occupation of Danzig, exploiting a\r\n    politically favorable situation, _not a war against Poland_.”\r\n    (_C-137_)\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Czechoslovakia had not yet been seized, and therefore\r\nthe Nazis were not yet ready to go to war with Poland. But Keitel’s\r\norder shows how the German government answered the Polish proposal to\r\nenter into discussions.\r\n\r\nOn 5 January 1939 Mr. Beck had a conversation with Hitler. (_TC-73 No.\r\n48_). Ribbentrop was also present. In the first part of that\r\nconversation, of which that document is an account, Hitler offered to\r\nanswer any questions. He said he had always followed the policy laid\r\ndown by the 1934 agreement. He discussed the question of Danzig and\r\nemphasized that in the German view it must sooner or later return to\r\nGermany. The conversation continued:\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Beck replied that the Danzig question was a very difficult\r\n    problem. He added that in the Chancellor’s suggestion he did not\r\n    see any equivalent for Poland, and that the whole of Polish\r\n    opinion, and not only people thinking politically but the widest\r\n    spheres of Polish society, were particularly sensitive on this\r\n    matter.\r\n\r\n    “In answer to this the Chancellor stated that to solve this\r\n    problem it would be necessary to try to find something quite\r\n    new, some new form, for which he used the term ‘_Korperschaft_,’\r\n    which on the one hand would safeguard the interests of the\r\n    German population, and on the other the Polish interests. In\r\n    addition, the Chancellor declared that the Minister could be\r\n    quite at ease, there would be no faits accomplis in Danzig and\r\n    nothing would be done to render difficult the situation of the\r\n    Polish Government.” (_TC-73 No. 48_)\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in the previous document discussed (_C-137_)\r\norders had already been issued for preparations to be made for the\r\noccupation of Danzig by surprise. Yet some six weeks later Hitler\r\nassured the Polish Foreign Minister that there would be no fait accompli\r\nand that he should be quite at his ease.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the conversation between Beck and Hitler, Beck and\r\nRibbentrop conferred, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Beck asked M. Von Ribbentrop to inform the Chancellor that\r\n    whereas previously, after all his conversations and contacts\r\n    with German statesmen, he had been feeling optimistic, today for\r\n    the first time he was in a pessimistic mood. Particularly in\r\n    regard to the Danzig question, as it had been raised by the\r\n    Chancellor, he saw no possibility whatever of agreement.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In answer M. Von Ribbentrop once more emphasized that Germany\r\n    was not seeking any violent solution. The basis of their policy\r\n    towards Poland was still a desire for the further building up of\r\n    friendly relations. It was necessary to seek such a method of\r\n    clearing away the difficulties as would respect the rights and\r\n    interests of the two parties concerned.” (_TC-73 No. 49_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop apparently was not satisfied with that one expression of good\r\nfaith. On the 25th of the same month, January 1939, he was in Warsaw and\r\nmade another speech, of which the following is a pertinent extract:\r\n\r\n    “In accordance with the resolute will of the German National\r\n    Leader, the continual progress and consolidation of friendly\r\n    relations between Germany and Poland, based upon the existing\r\n    agreement between us, constitute an essential element in German\r\n    foreign policy. The political foresight, and the principles\r\n    worthy of true statesmanship, which induced both sides to take\r\n    the momentous decision of 1934, provide a guarantee that all\r\n    other problems arising in the course of the future evolution of\r\n    events will also be solved in the same spirit, with due regard\r\n    to the respect and understanding of the rightful interests of\r\n    both sides. Thus Poland and Germany can look forward to the\r\n    future with full confidence in the solid basis of their mutual\r\n    relations.” (_2530-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler spoke in the Reichstag on 30 January 1939, and gave further\r\nassurances of the good faith of the German Government. (_TC-73 No. 57_)\r\n\r\nIn March 1939 the remainder of Czechoslovakia was seized and the\r\nProtectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was set up. That seizure, as was\r\nrecognized by Hitler and Jodl, had immensely strengthened the German\r\nposition against Poland. Within a week of the completion of the\r\noccupation of Czechoslovakia heat was beginning to be applied on Poland.\r\n\r\nOn 21 March M. Lipski, the Polish ambassador, saw Ribbentrop. The nature\r\nof the conversation was generally very much sharper than that of the\r\ndiscussion between Ribbentrop and Beck a little time back at the Grand\r\nHotel, Berchtesgaden:\r\n\r\n    “I saw M. Von Ribbentrop today. He began by saying he had asked\r\n    me to call on him in order to discuss Polish-German relations in\r\n    their entirety.\r\n\r\n    “He complained about our Press, and the Warsaw students’\r\n    demonstrations during Count Ciano’s visit.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Further, M. von Ribbentrop referred to the conversation at\r\n    Berchtesgaden between you and the Chancellor, in which Hitler\r\n    put forward the idea of guaranteeing Poland’s frontiers in\r\n    exchange for a motor road and the incorporation of Danzig in the\r\n    Reich. He said that there had been further conversations between\r\n    you and him in Warsaw on the subject, and that you had pointed\r\n    out the great difficulties in the way of accepting these\r\n    suggestions. He gave me to understand that all this had made an\r\n    unfavorable impression on the Chancellor, since so far he had\r\n    received no positive reaction whatever on our part to his\r\n    suggestions. M. von Ribbentrop had had a talk with the\r\n    Chancellor only yesterday. He stated that the Chancellor was\r\n    still in favor of good relations with Poland, and had expressed\r\n    a desire to have a thorough conversation with you on the subject\r\n    of our mutual relations. M. von Ribbentrop indicated that he was\r\n    under the impression that difficulties arising between us were\r\n    also due to some misunderstanding of the Reich’s real aims. The\r\n    problem needed to be considered on a higher plane. In his\r\n    opinion our two States were dependent on each other.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I [Lipski] stated that now, during the settlement of the\r\n    Czechoslovakian question, there was no understanding whatever\r\n    between us. The Czech issue was already hard enough for the\r\n    Polish public to swallow, for, despite our disputes with the\r\n    Czechs they were after all a Slav people. But in regard to\r\n    Slovakia the position was far worse. I emphasized our community\r\n    of race, language and religion, and mentioned the help we had\r\n    given in their achievement of independence. I pointed out our\r\n    long frontier with Slovakia. I indicated that the Polish man in\r\n    the street could not understand why the Reich had assumed the\r\n    protection of Slovakia, that protection being directed against\r\n    Poland. I said emphatically that this question was a serious\r\n    blow to our relations.\r\n\r\n    “Ribbentrop reflected a moment, and then answered that this\r\n    could be discussed.\r\n\r\n    “I promised to refer to you the suggestion of a conversation\r\n    between you and the Chancellor. Ribbentrop remarked that I might\r\n    go to Warsaw during the next few days to talk over this matter.\r\n    He advised that the talk should not be delayed, lest the\r\n    Chancellor should come to the conclusion that Poland was\r\n    rejecting all his offers.\r\n\r\n    “Finally, I asked whether he could tell me anything about his\r\n    conversation with the Foreign Minister of Lithuania.\r\n\r\n    “Ribbentrop answered vaguely that he had seen Mr. Urbszys on the\r\n    latter’s return from Rome, and they had discussed the Memel\r\n    question, which called for a solution.” (_TC-73 No. 61_)\r\n\r\nThat conversation took place on 21 March. The world soon learned what\r\nthe solution to Memel was. On the next day German armed forces marched\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these events, considerable anxiety was growing both in\r\nthe government of Great Britain and the Polish government, and the two\r\ngovernments therefore had been undertaking conversations between each\r\nother. On 31 March, the Prime Minister, Mr. Chamberlain, spoke in the\r\nHouse of Commons. He explained the results of the conversations that had\r\nbeen taking place between the British and Polish Governments:\r\n\r\n    “As the House is aware, certain consultations are now proceeding\r\n    with other governments. In order to make perfectly clear the\r\n    position of His Majesty’s government in the meantime before\r\n    those consultations are concluded, I now have to inform the\r\n    House that during that period, in the event of any action which\r\n    clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish\r\n    government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their\r\n    national forces, His Majesty’s government would feel themselves\r\n    bound at once to lend the Polish government all support in their\r\n    power. They have given the Polish government an assurance to\r\n    this effect.\r\n\r\n    “I may add that the French government have authorized me to make\r\n    it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as\r\n    do His Majesty’s Government.” (_TC-72 No. 17_)\r\n\r\nOn 6 April, a week later, a formal communique was issued by the\r\nAnglo-Polish governments, which repeated the assurance the Prime\r\nMinister had given a week before, and in which Poland assured Great\r\nBritain of her support should Great Britain be attacked. (_TC-72 No.\r\n18_)\r\n\r\nThe anxiety and concern that the governments of Poland and Great Britain\r\nwere feeling at that time appears to have been justified. During the\r\nsame week, on 3 April, an order, signed by Keitel, emanated from the\r\nHigh Command of the Armed Forces. It is dated Berlin, 3 April 1939. The\r\nsubject is “Directive for the Armed Forces 1939/40.” The order reads:\r\n\r\n    “Directive for the uniform preparation of war by the Armed\r\n    Forces for 1939/40 is being reissued.\r\n\r\n    “Part I (Frontier Defense) and Part III (Danzig) will be issued\r\n    in the middle of April. Their basic principles remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n    “Part II ‘_Fall Weiss_’ [the code name for the operation against\r\n    Poland] is attached herewith. The signature of the Fuehrer will\r\n    be appended later.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has added the following Directives to ‘_Fall\r\n    Weiss_’:\r\n\r\n    “1. Preparations must be made in such a way that the operations\r\n    can be carried out at any time from 1st September 1939 onwards.\r\n\r\n    “2. The High Command of the Armed Forces has been directed to\r\n    draw up a precise timetable for ‘_Fall Weiss_’ and to arrange by\r\n    conferences the synchronized timings between the three branches\r\n    of the armed forces.\r\n\r\n    “3. The plan of the branches of the Armed Forces and the details\r\n    for the timetable must be submitted to the OKW by the 1st of\r\n    May, 1939.” (C-120)\r\n\r\nThis order was distributed to the OKH, OKM, and OKW.\r\n\r\nAnother document, dated 11 April, and signed by Hitler, is annexed. It\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “I shall lay down in a later directive the future tasks of the\r\n    Armed Forces and the preparations to be made in accordance with\r\n    these for the conduct of the war.\r\n\r\n    “Until that directive comes into force, the Armed Forces must be\r\n    prepared for the following eventualities:\r\n\r\n    “I. Safeguarding the frontiers of the German Reich, and\r\n    protection against surprise air attacks.\r\n\r\n    “II. ‘_Fall Weiss_’.\r\n\r\n    “III. The annexation of Danzig.\r\n\r\n    “Annex IV contains regulations for the exercise of military\r\n    authority in East Prussia in the event of a warlike\r\n    development.” (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nAgain, copies of that document went to the OKH, OKM, and OKW. Annex I to\r\nthis order, which concerns the safeguarding of the frontiers of the\r\nGerman Reich, declares:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Legal Basis: It should be anticipated that a state of\r\n    Defense or State of War, as defined in the Reichdefense law of\r\n    the 4th of September 1938, will not be declared. All measures\r\n    and demands necessary for carrying out a mobilization are to be\r\n    based on the laws valid in peacetime.” (_C-120_)\r\n\r\nThe statement of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, followed by\r\nthe Anglo-Polish communique of 6 April, was seized upon by the Nazi\r\ngovernment to urge on the crisis which they were developing in Danzig\r\nbetween themselves and Poland.\r\n\r\nOn 28 April the German government issued a memorandum in which they\r\nalleged that the Anglo-Polish declaration was incompatible with the 1934\r\nAgreement between Poland and Germany, and that as a result of entering\r\ninto or by reason of entering into that agreement, Poland had\r\nunilaterally renounced the 1934 agreement. The following are pertinent\r\npassages from that memorandum:\r\n\r\n    “The German government have taken note of the Polish-British\r\n    declaration regarding the progress and aims of the negotiations\r\n    recently conducted between Poland and Great Britain. According\r\n    to this declaration there had been concluded between the Polish\r\n    government and the British government a temporary understanding\r\n    to be released shortly by a permanent agreement which will\r\n    provide for the giving of mutual assistance by Poland and Great\r\n    Britain in the event of the independence of one of the two\r\n    states being directly or indirectly threatened.” (_TC-72 No.\r\n    14_)\r\n\r\nThe memorandum goes on to set out in the next three paragraphs the\r\nhistory of German friendship towards Poland. It continues:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The agreement which has now been concluded by the Polish\r\n    government with the British government is in such obvious\r\n    contradiction to these solemn declarations of a few months ago\r\n    that the German government can take note only with surprise and\r\n    astonishment of such a violent reversal of Polish policy.\r\n\r\n    “Irrespective of the manner in which its final formulation may\r\n    be determined by both parties, the new Polish-British agreement\r\n    is intended as a regular Pact of Alliance, which, by reason of\r\n    its general sense and of the present state of political\r\n    relations, is directed exclusively against Germany.\r\n\r\n    “From the obligation now accepted by the Polish government, it\r\n    appears that Poland intends, in certain circumstances, to take\r\n    an active part in any possible German-British conflict, in the\r\n    event of aggression against Germany, even should this conflict\r\n    not affect Poland and her interests. This is a direct and open\r\n    blow against the renunciation of all use of force contained in\r\n    the 1934 declaration.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Polish government, however, by their recent decision to\r\n    accede to an alliance directed against Germany have given it to\r\n    be understood that they prefer a promise of help by a third\r\n    power to the direct guarantee of peace by the German government.\r\n    In view of this, the German government are obliged to conclude\r\n    that the Polish government do not at present attach any\r\n    importance to seeking a solution of German-Polish problems by\r\n    means of direct, friendly discussion with the German government.\r\n    The Polish government have thus abandoned the path traced out in\r\n    1934 to the shaping of German-Polish relations.” (_TC-72 No.\r\n    14_)\r\n\r\nAll this would sound very well, if it had not been for the fact that\r\norders for the invasion of Poland had already been issued and the Armed\r\nForces had been told to draw up a precise timetable.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum goes on to set out the history of the last negotiations\r\nand discussions. It sets out the demands of the 21st which the German\r\ngovernment had made for the return of Danzig, the autobahn, and the\r\nrailway. It mentions the promise by Germany of the twenty-five year\r\nguarantee, and continues:\r\n\r\n    “The Polish government did not avail themselves of the\r\n    opportunity offered to them by the German government for a just\r\n    settlement of the Danzig question; for the final safeguarding of\r\n    Poland’s frontiers with the Reich and thereby for permanent\r\n    strengthening of the friendly, neighbourly relations between the\r\n    two countries. The Polish government even rejected German\r\n    proposals made with this object.\r\n\r\n    “At the same time the Polish government accepted, with regard to\r\n    another state, political obligations which are not compatible\r\n    either with the spirit, the meaning or the text of the\r\n    German-Polish declaration of the 26 of January, 1934. Thereby,\r\n    the Polish government arbitrarily and unilaterally rendered this\r\n    declaration null and void.” (_TC-72 No. 14_)\r\n\r\nIn the last paragraph the German government says, that nevertheless,\r\nthey are prepared to continue friendly relations with Poland.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that memorandum was issued, 28 April, Hitler made a\r\nspeech in the Reichstag, in which he repeated, in effect, the terms of\r\nthe memorandum. He repeated the demands and offers that Germany made in\r\nMarch, and went on to say that the Polish government have rejected his\r\noffer. He expressed his disappointment:\r\n\r\n    “I have regretted greatly this incomprehensible attitude of the\r\n    Polish government. But that alone is not the decisive fact. The\r\n    worst is that now Poland, like Czechoslovakia, a year ago,\r\n    believes under the pressure of a lying international campaign,\r\n    that it must call up troops although Germany, on her part, has\r\n    not called up a single man and had not thought of proceeding in\r\n    any way against Poland. As I have said, this is, in itself, very\r\n    regrettable and posterity will one day decide whether it was\r\n    really right to refuse the suggestion made this once by me.\r\n    This, as I have said, was an endeavor on my part to solve a\r\n    question which intimately affects the German people, by a truly\r\n    unique compromise and to solve it to the advantage of both\r\n    countries. According to my conviction, Poland was not a giving\r\n    party in this solution at all, but only a receiving party,\r\n    because it should be beyond all doubt, that Danzig will never\r\n    become Polish. The intention to attack on the part of Germany,\r\n    which was merely invented by the International Press, led, as\r\n    you know, to the so-called guarantee offer, and to an obligation\r\n    on the part of the Polish government for mutual assistance. * *\r\n    *” (_TC-72 No. 13_)\r\n\r\nThe speech demonstrates how completely dishonest was everything that the\r\nGerman government was saying at that time. Hitler, who may very well\r\nhave had a copy of the orders for “_Fall Weiss_” in his pocket as he\r\nspoke, announced publicly, that the intention to attack by Germany was\r\nan invention of “the International Press.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to that memorandum and that speech, the Polish government\r\nissued a memorandum on 5 May. It sets out the objectives of the 1934\r\nagreement to renounce the use of force and to carry on friendly\r\nrelationship between the two countries; to solve difficulties by\r\narbitration and other friendly means. The Polish government states its\r\nawareness of the difficulties about Danzig and declares that it has long\r\nbeen ready to carry out discussions. The Polish government sets out\r\nagain its part of the recent discussions. The Polish government states\r\nthat it communicated its views to the German government on 26 March, and\r\nthat it then proposed joint guarantees by the Polish and German\r\ngovernments of the City of Danzig, based on the principles of freedom\r\nfor the local population in internal affairs. The Poles stated their\r\npreparedness to examine the possibilities of a motor road and railway\r\nfacilities. They received no reply to those proposals. The Polish\r\nposition is summarized in one sentence:\r\n\r\n    “It is clear that negotiations in which one State formulates\r\n    demands and the other is to be obliged to accept those demands\r\n    unaltered are not negotiations in the spirit of the declaration\r\n    of 1934 and are incompatible with the vital interests and\r\n    dignity of Poland” (_TC-72 No. 16_).\r\n\r\nThe Polish government proceeds to reject the German accusation that the\r\nAnglo-Polish agreement is incompatible with the 1934 German-Polish\r\nagreement. It states that Germany herself has entered into similar\r\nagreements with other nations, and lastly it announces that it is still\r\nwilling to entertain a new pact with Germany, should Germany wish to do\r\nso. (_TC-72 No. 16_)\r\n\r\nThe German answer was contained in a letter from the Supreme Commander\r\nof the Armed Forces, is signed by Hitler, and dated 10 May (_C-120_).\r\nCopies went to the various branches of the OKW, and with them apparently\r\nwere enclosed “Instructions for the economic war and the protection of\r\nour own economy.” Not only were military preparations being carried out\r\nthroughout these months and weeks, but economic and every other kind of\r\npreparation was being made for war at the earliest moment.\r\n\r\nThis period of preparation, up to May 1939, concluded with the\r\nconference in the Reichschancellery on 23 May. The report of this\r\nmeeting is known as the Schmundt Minutes (_L-79_). In his address to the\r\nconference Hitler cried out for _lebensraum_ and said that Danzig was\r\nnot the dispute at all. It was a question of expanding their living room\r\nin the east, and he said that the decision had been taken to attack\r\nPoland.\r\n\r\nGoering, Raeder and Keitel, among many others, were present. The\r\nfollowing is a significant paragraph:\r\n\r\n    “If there were an alliance of France, England and Russia against\r\n    Germany, Italy and Japan, I would be constrained to attack\r\n    England and France with a few annihilating blows. The Fuehrer\r\n    doubts the possibility of a peaceful settlement with England.”\r\n    (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nSo that, not only has the decision been taken definitely to attack\r\nPoland, but almost equally definitely to attack England and France.\r\n\r\nC. _Final Preparations: June-September 1939_\r\n\r\n(1) _Final Preparations of the Armed Forces._ A precise timetable for\r\nthe attack had been called for. On 22 June 1939 it was ready. It\r\nprovided as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Supreme Command of the Armed Forces has submitted to the\r\n    Fuehrer and Supreme Commander a ‘preliminary timetable’ for\r\n    ‘_Fall Weiss_’ based on the particulars so far available from\r\n    the Navy, Army and Air Force. Details concerning the days\r\n    preceding the attack and the start of the attack were not\r\n    included in this timetable.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and the Supreme Commander is, in the main, in\r\n    agreement with the intentions of the Navy, Army and Air Force\r\n    and made the following comments on individual points:—\r\n\r\n    “1. In order not to disquiet the population by calling up\r\n    reserves on a larger scale than usual for the maneuvers\r\n    scheduled for 1939, as is intended, civilian establishments,\r\n    employers or other private persons who make enquiries should be\r\n    told that men are being called up for the autumn maneuvers and\r\n    for the exercise units it is intended to form for these\r\n    maneuvers.\r\n\r\n    “It is requested that directions to this effect be issued to\r\n    subordinate establishments.” (_C-126_)\r\n\r\nAll this became relevant later, when the German government made\r\nallegations of mobilization on the part of the Poles. This order shows\r\nthat in June the Germans were mobilizing, only doing so secretly. The\r\norder continues:\r\n\r\n    “For reasons of security the clearing of hospitals in the area\r\n    of the frontier which the Supreme Command of the Army proposed\r\n    should take place from the middle of July, must not be carried\r\n    out.” (_C-126_)\r\n\r\nThe order is signed by Keitel.\r\n\r\nA short letter, dated 2 August, which is attached to that order, reads\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n    “Attached are Operational Directions for the employment of\r\n    U-Boats which are to be sent out to the Atlantic, by way of\r\n    precaution, in the event of the intention to carry out ‘_Fall\r\n    Weiss_’ remaining unchanged. F.O. U-Boats [Doenitz] is handing\r\n    in his Operation Orders by 12 August.” (_C-126_)\r\n\r\nAnother letter, dated 27 July, contains orders for the Air and Sea\r\nForces for the occupation of the German Free City of Danzig. It\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces has\r\n    ordered the reunion of the German Free State of Danzig with the\r\n    Greater German Reich. The Armed Forces must occupy the Danzig\r\n    Free State immediately in order to protect the German\r\n    population. There will be no hostile intention on the part of\r\n    Poland so long as the occupation takes place without the force\r\n    of arms.” (_C-30_)\r\n\r\nThe letter then sets out how the occupation is to be effected. All this\r\nagain becomes more relevant in the subsequent discussion of the\r\ndiplomatic action of the last few days before the war, when Germany was\r\nmaking specious offers for the settlement of the question by peaceful\r\nmeans. This letter is evidence that the decision had been taken, and\r\nthat nothing would change that decision. During July, right up to the\r\ntime of the war, steps were being taken to arm the population of Danzig\r\nand to prepare them to take part in the coming occupation.\r\n\r\nThe reports which were coming back almost daily during this period from\r\nMr. Shepherd, British Consul-General in Danzig, to the British Foreign\r\nMinister, and published in the British Blue Book, show the kind of thing\r\nthat was happening. The report dated 1 July 1939 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Yesterday morning four German army officers in mufti arrived\r\n    here by night express from Berlin to organize Danzig _Heimwehr_.\r\n\r\n    “All approaches to hills and dismantled fort, which constitute a\r\n    popular public promenade on western fringe of the city, have\r\n    been closed with barbed wire and ‘_verboten_’ notices.\r\n\r\n    “The walls surrounding the shipyards bear placards: ‘Comrades\r\n    keep your mouths shut lest you regret consequence.’\r\n\r\n    “Master of British steamer ‘High Commissioner Wood’ whilst he\r\n    was roving Koenigsberg from 28th June to 30th June, observed\r\n    considerable military activity, including extensive shipment of\r\n    camouflaged covered lorries and similar material by small\r\n    coasting vessels. On 28th June four medium-sized steamers,\r\n    loaded with troops, lorries, field kitchens, etc., left\r\n    Koenigsberg, ostensibly returning to Hamburg after maneuvers,\r\n    but actually proceeding to Stettin.” (_TC-71_).\r\n\r\nAnd again, as another example, the report dated 10 July states:\r\n\r\n    “The same informant, whom I believe to be reliable, advises me\r\n    that on 8th July he personally saw about thirty military lorries\r\n    with East Prussian license numbers on the Bischofsberg, where\r\n    numerous field kitchens had been placed along the hedges. There\r\n    were also eight large anti-aircraft guns in position, which he\r\n    estimated as being of over 3-inch caliber, and three\r\n    six-barreled light anti-aircraft machine guns. There were about\r\n    500 men drilling with rifles, and the whole place is extensively\r\n    fortified with barbed wire.” (_TC-71_).\r\n\r\nOn 12 and 13 August, when preparations were practically complete, Hitler\r\nand Ribbentrop at last disclosed their intentions to their allies, the\r\nItalians. It will be recalled that one of the passages in Hitler’s\r\nspeech on 23 May, in regard to the proposed attack on Poland, had said,\r\n“Our object must be kept secret even from the Italians and the\r\nJapanese.” (_L-79_). Now, when the preparations were complete, Hitler\r\ndisclosed his intentions to his Italian comrades in the hope that they\r\nwould join him. Ciano was surprised at Hitler’s attempt to persuade the\r\nItalians to come into the war with him. He had no idea, as he said, of\r\nthe urgency of the matter, and they are not prepared. He therefore tried\r\nto dissuade Hitler from starting off until the Duce could have a little\r\nmore time to prepare himself. (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\nThe minutes of that meeting show quite clearly the German intention to\r\nattack England and France ultimately, if not at the same time as Poland.\r\nIn trying to show the strength of Germany and its certainty of winning\r\nthe war as a means of persuading the Italians to come in, Hitler\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n    “At sea, England had for the moment no immediate reinforcements\r\n    in prospect. Some time would elapse before any of the ships now\r\n    under construction could be taken into service. As far as the\r\n    land army was concerned, after the introduction of conscription\r\n    60,000 men had been called to the colors. If England kept the\r\n    necessary troops in her own country she could send to France, at\r\n    the most, two infantry divisions and one armored division. For\r\n    the rest she could supply a few bomber squadrons but hardly any\r\n    fighters since, at the outbreak of war, the German Air Force\r\n    would at once attack England and the English fighters would be\r\n    urgently needed for the defense of their own country.\r\n\r\n    “With regard to the position of France, the Fuehrer said that in\r\n    the event of a general war, after the destruction of\r\n    Poland—which would not take long—Germany would be in a\r\n    position to assemble hundreds of divisions along the West Wall\r\n    and France would then be compelled to concentrate all her\r\n    available forces from the Colonies, from the Italian frontier\r\n    and elsewhere on her own Maginot Line, for the life and death\r\n    struggle which would then ensue. The Fuehrer also thought that\r\n    the French would find it no easier to overrun the Italian\r\n    fortifications than to overrun the West Wall. Here Count Ciano\r\n    showed signs of extreme doubt. The Polish Army was most uneven\r\n    in quality. Together with a few parade divisions, there were\r\n    large numbers of troops of less value. Poland was very weak in\r\n    anti-tank and anti-aircraft defense and at the moment neither\r\n    France nor England could help her in this respect.\r\n\r\n    “If, however, Poland were given assistance by the Western\r\n    powers, over a longer period, she could obtain these weapons and\r\n    German superiority would thereby be diminished. In contrast to\r\n    the fanatics of Warsaw and Cracow, the population of their areas\r\n    was different. Furthermore, it was necessary to consider the\r\n    position of the Polish State. Out of 34 million inhabitants, one\r\n    and one-half million were German, about four million were Jews,\r\n    and nine million Ukrainians, so that genuine Poles were much\r\n    less in number than the total population and, as already said,\r\n    their striking power was not to be valued highly. In these\r\n    circumstances Poland could be struck to the ground by Germany in\r\n    the shortest time.\r\n\r\n    “Since the Poles, through their whole attitude, had made it\r\n    clear that in any case in the event of a conflict they would\r\n    stand on the side of the enemies of Germany and Italy, a quick\r\n    liquidation at the present moment could only be of advantage for\r\n    the unavoidable conflict with the Western Democracies. If a\r\n    hostile Poland remained on Germany’s eastern frontier, not only\r\n    would the eleven East Prussian divisions be tied down, but also\r\n    further contingents would be kept in Pomerania and Silesia. This\r\n    would not be necessary in the event of a previous liquidation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Coming back to the Danzig question, the Fuehrer said that it\r\n    was impossible for him now to go back. He had made an agreement\r\n    with Italy for the withdrawal of the Germans from South Tyrol,\r\n    but for this reason he must take the greatest care to avoid\r\n    giving the impression that this Tyrolese withdrawal could be\r\n    taken as a precedent for other areas. Furthermore, he had\r\n    justified the withdrawal by pointing to a general easterly and\r\n    northeasterly direction of a German policy. The east and\r\n    northeast, that is to say the Baltic countries, had been\r\n    Germany’s undisputed sphere of influence since time immemorial,\r\n    as the Mediterranean had been an appropriate sphere for Italy.\r\n    For economic reasons also, Germany needed the foodstuffs and\r\n    timber from these eastern regions.” (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\nNow the truth of this matter appears. It is not the persecution of\r\nGerman minorities on the Polish frontiers, but economic reasons—the\r\nneed for foodstuffs and timber from Poland. The minutes of the\r\nItalo-German meeting continue:\r\n\r\n    “In the case of Danzig, German interests were not only material,\r\n    although the city had the greatest harbour in the Baltic. Danzig\r\n    was a Nurnberg of the North, an ancient German city awakening\r\n    sentimental feelings for every German, and the Fuehrer was bound\r\n    to take account of this psychological element in public opinion.\r\n    To make a comparison with Italy, Count Ciano should suppose that\r\n    Trieste was in Yugoslav hands and that a large Italian minority\r\n    was being treated brutally on Yugoslav soil. It would be\r\n    difficult to assume that Italy would long remain quiet over\r\n    anything of this kind.\r\n\r\n    “Count Ciano, in replying to the Fuehrer’s statement, first\r\n    expressed the great surprise on the Italian side over the\r\n    completely unexpected seriousness of the position. Neither in\r\n    the conversations in Milan nor in those which took place during\r\n    his Berlin visit had there been any sign from the German side\r\n    that the position with regard to Poland was so serious. On the\r\n    contrary, Ribbentrop had said that in his opinion the Danzig\r\n    question would be settled in the course of time. On these\r\n    grounds, the Duce, in view of his conviction that a conflict\r\n    with the Western Powers was unavoidable, had assumed that he\r\n    should make his preparations for this event; he had made plans\r\n    for a period of two or three years. If immediate conflict were\r\n    unavoidable, the Duce, as he had told Ciano, would certainly\r\n    stand on the German side, but for various reasons he would\r\n    welcome the postponement of a general conflict until a later\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    “Ciano then showed, with the aid of a map, the position of Italy\r\n    in the event of a general war. Italy believed that a conflict\r\n    with Poland would not be limited to that country but would\r\n    develop into a general European war.” (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\nThereafter, Ciano tried to dissuade Hitler from any immediate action. He\r\nargued further:\r\n\r\n    “For these reasons the Duce insisted that the Axis Powers should\r\n    make a gesture which would reassure people of the peaceful\r\n    intentions of Italy and Germany.” (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer’s answer was clear:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer answered that for a solution of the Polish problem\r\n    no time should be lost; the longer one waited until the autumn,\r\n    the more difficult would military operations in Eastern Europe\r\n    become. From the middle of September, weather conditions made\r\n    air operations hardly possible in these areas, while the\r\n    condition of the roads, which were quickly turned into a morass\r\n    by the autumn rains, would be such as to make them impossible\r\n    for motorized forces. From September to May, Poland was a great\r\n    marsh and entirely unsuited for any kind of military operations.\r\n    Poland could, however, occupy Danzig in September and Germany\r\n    would not be able to do anything about it since they obviously\r\n    could not bombard or destroy the place.” (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\nThe Germans could not possibly bombard or destroy any place such as\r\nDanzig where there happened to be Germans living. The discussion\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n    “Ciano asked how soon, according to the Fuehrer’s view, the\r\n    Danzig question must be settled. The Fuehrer answered that this\r\n    settlement must be made one way or another by the end of August.\r\n    To the question of Ciano’s as to what solution the Fuehrer\r\n    proposed, Hitler answered that Poland must give up political\r\n    control of Danzig, but that Polish economic interests would\r\n    obviously be reserved and that Polish general behavior must\r\n    contribute to a general lessening of the tension. He doubted\r\n    whether Poland was ready to accept this solution since, up to\r\n    the present, the German proposals had been refused. The Fuehrer\r\n    had made this proposal personally to Beck at his visit to\r\n    Obersalzberg. They were extremely favorable to Poland. In return\r\n    for the political surrender of Danzig, under a complete\r\n    guarantee of Polish interests and the establishment of a\r\n    connection between East Prussia and the Reich, Germany would\r\n    have given a frontier guarantee, a 25-year pact of friendship\r\n    and the participation of Poland in influence over Slovakia. Beck\r\n    had received the proposal with the remark that he was willing to\r\n    examine it. The plain refusal of it came only as a result of\r\n    English intervention. The general Polish aims could be seen\r\n    clearly from the press. They wanted the whole of East Prussia,\r\n    and even proposed to advance to Berlin.” (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held over that night, and it continued on the following\r\nday:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer had therefore come to two definite conclusions: (1)\r\n    in the event of any further provocation, he would immediately\r\n    attack; (2) if Poland did not clearly and plainly state her\r\n    political intention, she must be forced to do so.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “As matters now stand, Germany and Italy would simply not exist\r\n    further in the world through lack of space; not only was there\r\n    no more space, but existing space was completely blockaded by\r\n    its present possessors; they sat like misers with their heaps of\r\n    gold and deluded themselves about their riches. The Western\r\n    Democracies were dominated by the desire to rule the world and\r\n    would not regard Germany and Italy as their class. This\r\n    psychological element of contempt was perhaps the worst thing\r\n    about the whole business. It could only be settled by a life and\r\n    death struggle which the two Axis partners could meet more\r\n    easily because their interests did not clash on any point.\r\n\r\n    “The Mediterranean was obviously the most ancient domain for\r\n    which Italy had a claim to predominance. The Duce himself had\r\n    summed up the position to him in the words that Italy already\r\n    was the dominant power in the Mediterranean. On the other hand,\r\n    the Fuehrer said that Germany must take the old German road\r\n    eastwards and that this road was also desirable for economic\r\n    reasons, and that Italy had geographical and historical claims\r\n    to permanency in the Mediterranean. Bismarck had recognized it\r\n    and had said as much in his well-known letter to Mazzini. The\r\n    interests of Germany and Italy went in quite different\r\n    directions and there never could be a conflict between them.\r\n\r\n    “Ribbentrop added that if the two problems mentioned in\r\n    yesterday’s conversations were settled, Italy and Germany would\r\n    have their backs free for work against the West. The Fuehrer\r\n    said that Poland must be struck down so that for 50 years she\r\n    would be incapable of fighting. In such a case, matters in the\r\n    West could be settled.\r\n\r\n    “Ciano thanked the Fuehrer for his extremely clear explanation\r\n    of the situation. He had, on his side, nothing to add and would\r\n    give the Duce full details. He asked for more definite\r\n    information on one point in order that the Duce might have all\r\n    the facts before him. The Duce might indeed have to make no\r\n    decision because the Fuehrer believed that the conflict with\r\n    Poland could be localized on the basis of long experience.\r\n    He—Ciano—quite saw that so far the Fuehrer had always been\r\n    right in his judgment of the position. If, however, Mussolini\r\n    had no decision to make, he had to take certain measures of\r\n    precaution, and therefore Ciano would put the following\r\n    question:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer had mentioned two conditions under which he would\r\n    take Poland (1) if Poland were guilty of serious provocation,\r\n    and (2) if Poland did not make her political position clear. The\r\n    first of these conditions depended on the decision of the\r\n    Fuehrer, and German reaction could follow it in a moment. The\r\n    second condition required certain decisions as to time. Ciano\r\n    therefore asked what was the date by which Poland must have\r\n    satisfied Germany about her political condition. He realized\r\n    that this date depended upon climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer answered that the decision of Poland must be made\r\n    clear at the latest by the end of August. Since, however, the\r\n    decisive part of military operations against Poland could be\r\n    carried out within a period of 14 days and the final liquidation\r\n    would need another four weeks, it could be finished at the end\r\n    of September or the beginning of October. These could be\r\n    regarded as the dates. It followed, therefore, that the last\r\n    dates on which he could begin to take action was the end of\r\n    August.\r\n\r\n    “Finally, the Fuehrer assured Ciano that since his youth he had\r\n    favored German-Italian cooperation, and that no other view was\r\n    expressed in his books. He had always thought that Germany and\r\n    Italy were naturally suited for collaboration, since there were\r\n    no conflicts of interest between them. He was personally\r\n    fortunate to live at a time in which, apart from himself, there\r\n    was one other statesman who would stand out great and unique in\r\n    history; that he could be this man’s friend was for him a matter\r\n    of great personal satisfaction, and if the hour of common battle\r\n    struck, he would always be found on the side of the Duce.”\r\n    (_TC-77_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Economic Preparations._ If the military preparations were\r\nthroughout this period nearing their completion, at the same time the\r\neconomists had not been idle. A letter dated 25 August 1939, from Funk\r\nto the Feuhrer, reads:\r\n\r\n    “My Fuehrer!\r\n\r\n    “I thank you sincerely and heartily for your most friendly and\r\n    kind wishes on the occasion of my birthday. How happy and how\r\n    grateful to you we ought to be for being granted the favor of\r\n    experiencing these overwhelmingly great and world-changing times\r\n    and taking part in the mighty events of these days.\r\n\r\n    “The information given to me by Field Marshal Goering, that you,\r\n    my Fuehrer, yesterday evening approved in principle the measures\r\n    prepared by me for financing the war and for shaping the\r\n    relationship between wages and prices and for carrying through\r\n    emergency sacrifices, made me deeply happy. I hereby report to\r\n    you with all respect that I have succeeded by means of\r\n    precautions taken during the last few months, in making the\r\n    Reichsbank internally so strong and externally so unassailable,\r\n    that even the most serious shocks in the international money and\r\n    credit market cannot affect us in the least. In the meantime I\r\n    have quite inconspicuously changed into gold all the assets of\r\n    the Reichsbank and of the whole of German economy abroad which\r\n    it was possible to lay hands on. Under the proposals I have\r\n    prepared for a ruthless elimination of all consumption which is\r\n    not of vital importance and of all public expenditure and public\r\n    works which are not of importance for the war effort, we will be\r\n    in a position to cope with all demands on finance and economy,\r\n    without any serious shocks. I have considered it my duty as the\r\n    General Plenipotentiary for Economy appointed by you to make\r\n    this report and solemn promise to you, my Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “Heil my Fuehrer  /signed/  Walter Funk.” (_699-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is difficult in view of that letter to see how Funk can claim that he\r\ndid not know of the preparations and of the intentions of the German\r\ngovernment to wage war.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Obersalzburg Speech._ On 22 August 1939, Hitler addressed his\r\ncommanders in chief at Obersalzburg. (_1014-PS_). At this date\r\npreparations were complete. In the course of his speech Hitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “Everybody shall have to make a point of it that we were\r\n    determined from the beginning to fight the Western powers.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Destruction of Poland in the foreground. The aim is elimination\r\n    of living forces, not the arrival at a certain line. Even if war\r\n    should break out in the West, the destruction of Poland shall be\r\n    the primary objective.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I shall give a propagandistic cause for starting the war—never\r\n    mind whether it be plausible or not. The victor shall not be\r\n    asked later on whether we told the truth or not. In starting and\r\n    making a war, not the Right is what matters but Victory.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It was clear to me that a conflict with Poland had to come\r\n    sooner or later. I had already made this decision in spring, but\r\n    I thought that I would first turn against the West in a few\r\n    years, and only afterwards against the East.” (_1014-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese passages emphasize the intention of the Nazi government not only\r\nto conquer Poland but ultimately, in any event, to wage aggressive war\r\nagainst the Western Democracies.\r\n\r\nIn another significant passage, Hitler stated:\r\n\r\n    “We need not be afraid of a blockade. The East will supply us\r\n    with grain, cattle, coal, lead and zinc. It is a big arm, which\r\n    demands great efforts. I am only afraid that at the last minute\r\n    some _Schweinehund_ will make a proposal for mediation.\r\n\r\n    “The political arm is set farther. A beginning has been made for\r\n    the destruction of England’s hegemony. The way is open for the\r\n    soldier, after I have made the political preparations.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Goering answers with thanks to the Fuehrer and the assurance\r\n    that the armed forces will do their duty.” (_798-PS_)\r\n\r\n(4) _Diplomatic Preparations: Provoking the Crisis._ On 23 August 1939,\r\nthe Danzig Senate passed a decree whereby Gauleiter Forster was\r\nappointed head of the State of the Free City of Danzig, a position which\r\ndid not exist under the statute setting up the constitution of the Free\r\nCity. (_TC-72 No. 62_). That event was, of course, aimed at stirring up\r\nfeeling in the Free City at that time.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, frontier incidents were being manufactured by the Nazi\r\nGovernment with the aid of the SS. The affidavit of General Lahousen\r\n(_Affidavit A_) refers to the provision of Polish uniforms to the SS\r\nForces for these purposes, so that dead Poles could be found lying about\r\non the German side of the frontier. Three short reports found in the\r\nBritish Blue Book corroborate this affidavit. They are reports from the\r\nBritish ambassador in Warsaw.\r\n\r\nThe first of them is dated 26 August, and reads:\r\n\r\n    “Series of incidents again occurred yesterday on German\r\n    frontier.\r\n\r\n    “Polish patrol met party Germans one kilometre from East\r\n    Prussian frontier near Pelta. Germans opened fire. Polish patrol\r\n    replied, killing leader, whose body is being returned.\r\n\r\n    “German bands also crossed Silesian frontier near Szczyglo,\r\n    twice near Rybnik and twice elsewhere, firing shots and\r\n    attacking blockhouses and customs posts with machine guns and\r\n    hand grenades. Poles have protested vigorously to Berlin.\r\n\r\n    “_Gazeta Polska_, in inspired leader, today says these are more\r\n    than incidents. They are clearly prepared acts of aggression of\r\n    para-military disciplined detachments supplied with regular\r\n    army’s arms, and in one case it was a regular army detachment.\r\n    Attacks more or less continuous.\r\n\r\n    “These incidents did not cause Poland to forsake calm and strong\r\n    attitude of defence. Facts spoke for themselves and acts of\r\n    aggression came from German side. This was best answer to\r\n    ravings of German press.\r\n\r\n    “Ministry for Foreign Affairs state uniformed German detachment\r\n    has since shot Pole across frontier and wounded another.”\r\n    (_TC-72 No. 53_)\r\n\r\nThe next report is dated the same date, 26 August and reads:\r\n\r\n    “Ministry for Foreign Affairs categorically deny story recounted\r\n    by Herr Hitler to French Ambassador that twenty-four Germans\r\n    were recently killed at Lodz and eight at Bielsko. Story is\r\n    without any foundation whatever.” (_TC-72 No. 54_)\r\n\r\nThe report of the next day, 27 August, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “So far as I can judge, German allegations of mass ill-treatment\r\n    of German minority by Polish authorities are gross exaggeration,\r\n    if not complete falsification.\r\n\r\n    “2. There is no sign of any loss of control of situation by\r\n    Polish civil authorities. Warsaw, and so far as I can ascertain,\r\n    the rest of Poland is still completely calm.\r\n\r\n    “3. Such allegations are reminiscent of Nazi propaganda methods\r\n    regarding Czechoslovakia last year.\r\n\r\n    “4. In any case it is purely and simply deliberate German\r\n    provocation in accordance with fixed policy that has since March\r\n    [when the rest of Czechoslovakia was seized] exacerbated feeling\r\n    between the two nationalities. I suppose this has been done with\r\n    object (a) creating war spirit in Germany (b) impressing public\r\n    opinion abroad (c) provoking either defeatism or apparent\r\n    aggression in Poland.\r\n\r\n    “5. It has signally failed to achieve either of the two latter\r\n    objects.\r\n\r\n    “6. It is noteworthy that Danzig was hardly mentioned by Herr\r\n    Hitler.\r\n\r\n    “7. German treatment of Czech Jews and Polish minority is\r\n    apparently negligible factor compared with alleged sufferings of\r\n    Germans in Poland where, be it noted, they do not amount to more\r\n    than 10 per cent of population in any commune.\r\n\r\n    “8. In face of these facts it can hardly be doubted that, if\r\n    Herr Hitler decided on war, it is for the sole purpose of\r\n    destroying Polish independence.\r\n\r\n    “9. I shall lose no opportunity of impressing on Minister for\r\n    Foreign Affairs necessity of doing everything possible to prove\r\n    that Herr Hitler’s allegations regarding German minority are\r\n    false.” (_TC-72 No. 55_)\r\n\r\nFurther corroboration of General Lahousen’s affidavit is contained in a\r\nmemorandum of a conversation between the writer and Keitel. That\r\nconversation with Keitel took place on 17 August, and went as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I reported my conference with Jost to Keitel. He said that he\r\n    would not pay any attention to this action, as the Fuehrer had\r\n    not informed him, and had only let him know that we were to\r\n    furnish Heydrich with Polish uniforms. He agrees that I instruct\r\n    the General Staff. He says that he does not think much of\r\n    actions of this kind. However, there is nothing else to be done\r\n    if they have been ordered by the Fuehrer, that he could not ask\r\n    the Fuehrer how he had planned the execution of this special\r\n    action. In regard to Dirschau, he has decided that this action\r\n    would be executed only by the Army.” (_795-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat was the position at the end of the third week in August 1939. On 22\r\nAugust the Russian-German Non-aggression Pact was signed in Moscow. The\r\norders to invade Poland were given immediately after the signing of that\r\ntreaty, and the H-hour was actually to be in the early morning of 25 of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n(5) _Pleas for peace._ On the same date, 22 August, news reached England\r\nthat the German-Russian agreement was being signed. The significance of\r\nthat pact from a military point of view as to Germany was obvious, and\r\nthe British government immediately made their position clear in one last\r\nhope, that the German government might possibly think better. The Prime\r\nMinister wrote to Hitler as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Your Excellency.\r\n\r\n    “Your Excellency will have already heard of certain measures\r\n    taken by His Majesty’s Government, and announced in the press\r\n    and on the wireless this evening.\r\n\r\n    “These steps have, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government,\r\n    been rendered necessary by the military movements which have\r\n    been reported from Germany, and by the fact that apparently the\r\n    announcement of a German-Soviet Agreement is taken in some\r\n    quarters in Berlin to indicate that intervention by Great\r\n    Britain on behalf of Poland is no longer a contingency that need\r\n    be reckoned with. No greater mistake could be made. Whatever may\r\n    prove to be the nature of the German-Soviet Agreement, it can\r\n    not alter Great Britain’s obligation to Poland, which His\r\n    Majesty’s Government have stated in public repeatedly and\r\n    plainly, and which they are determined to fulfill.\r\n\r\n    “It has been alleged that, if His Majesty’s Government had made\r\n    their position clear in 1914, the great catastrophe would have\r\n    been avoided. Whether or not there is any force in that\r\n    allegation, His Majesty’s Government are resolved that on this\r\n    occasion there shall be no such tragic misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n    “If the case should arise, they are resolved, and prepared, to\r\n    employ without delay all the forces at their command, and it is\r\n    impossible to foresee the end of hostilities once engaged. It\r\n    would be a dangerous illusion to think that, if war once starts,\r\n    it will come to an early end even if a success on any one of the\r\n    several fronts on which it will be engaged should have been\r\n    secured.” (_TC-72 No. 56_).\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister therefore urged the German government to try to solve\r\nthe difficulty without recourse to the use of force. He suggested that a\r\ntruce should be declared while direct discussions between the two\r\ngovernments, Polish and German, might take place. Prime Minister\r\nChamberlain concluded:\r\n\r\n    “At this moment I confess I can see no other way to avoid a\r\n    catastrophe that will involve Europe in war. In view of the\r\n    grave consequences to humanity, which may follow from the action\r\n    of their rulers, I trust that Your Excellency will weigh with\r\n    the utmost deliberation the considerations which I have put\r\n    before you.” (_TC-72 No. 56_).\r\n\r\nOn the following day, 23 August, Hitler replied to Prime Minister\r\nChamberlain. He started off by saying that Germany has always sought\r\nEngland’s friendship, and went on to say that Germany, “like every other\r\nState, possesses certain definite interests which it is impossible to\r\nrenounce.” The letter continued as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Germany was prepared to settle the questions of Danzig, and of\r\n    the Corridor by the method of negotiation on the basis of a\r\n    proposal of truly unparalleled magnanimity. The allegations\r\n    disseminated by England regarding a German mobilization against\r\n    Poland, the assertion of aggressive designs towards Roumania,\r\n    Hungary, etc., as well as the so-called guarantee declarations,\r\n    which were subsequently given, had, however, dispelled Polish\r\n    inclination to negotiate on a basis of this kind which would\r\n    have been tolerable for Germany also.\r\n\r\n    “The unconditional assurance given by England to Poland that she\r\n    would render assistance to that country in all circumstances\r\n    regardless of the causes from which a conflict might spring,\r\n    could only be interpreted in that country as an encouragement\r\n    thenceforward to unloosen, under cover of such a charter, a wave\r\n    of appalling terrorism against the one and a half million German\r\n    inhabitants living in Poland.\r\n\r\n    “The atrocities which then have been taking place in that\r\n    country are terrible for the victims, but intolerable for a\r\n    great power such as the German Reich, which is expected to\r\n    remain a passive onlooker during these happenings. Poland has\r\n    been guilty of numerous breaches of her legal obligations\r\n    towards the Free City of Danzig, has made demands in the\r\n    character of ultimata, and has initiated a process of economic\r\n    strangulation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Germany will not tolerate a continuance of the persecution of\r\n    the Germans.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The German Reich government has received information to the\r\n    effect that the British government has the intention to carry\r\n    out measures of mobilization which, according to the statements\r\n    contained in your own letter, are clearly directed against\r\n    Germany alone. This is said to be true of France as well. Since\r\n    Germany has never had the intention of taking military measures\r\n    other than those of a defensive character against England, or\r\n    France, and, as has already been emphasized, has never intended,\r\n    and does not in the future intend, to attack England, or France,\r\n    it follows that this announcement, as confirmed by you, Mr.\r\n    Prime Minister, in your own letter, can only refer to a\r\n    contemplated act of menace directed against the Reich. I,\r\n    therefore, inform your Excellency that in the event of these\r\n    military announcements being carried into effect, I shall order\r\n    immediate mobilization of the German forces.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The question of the treatment of European problems on a\r\n    peaceful basis is not a decision which rests on Germany, but\r\n    primarily on those who since the crime committed by the\r\n    Versailles dictate have stubbornly and consistently opposed any\r\n    peaceful revision. Only after a change of spirit on the part of\r\n    the responsible powers can there be any real change in the\r\n    relationship between England and Germany. I have all my life\r\n    fought for Anglo-German friendship; the attitude adopted by\r\n    British diplomacy—at any rate up to the present—has, however,\r\n    convinced me of the futility of such an attempt. Should there be\r\n    any change in this respect in the future, nobody could be\r\n    happier than I.” (_TC-72 No. 60_).\r\n\r\nOn 25 August the formal Anglo-Polish Agreement of Mutual Assistance was\r\nsigned in London. Each government undertook to give assistance to the\r\nother in the event of aggression against either by any third power.\r\n(_TC-73 No. 91_)\r\n\r\nA few days later the French Prime Minister Daladier addressed a letter\r\nto Hitler, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The French ambassador in Berlin has informed me of your\r\n    personal communication * * *.\r\n\r\n    “In the hours in which you speak of the greatest responsibility\r\n    which two heads of the governments can possibly take upon\r\n    themselves, namely, that of shedding the blood of two great\r\n    nations, who long only for peace and work, I feel I owe it to\r\n    you personally, and to both our peoples to say that the fate of\r\n    peace still rests in your hands.\r\n\r\n    “You cannot doubt what are my own feelings towards Germany, nor\r\n    France’s peaceful feelings towards your nation. No Frenchman has\r\n    done more than myself to strengthen between our two nations not\r\n    only peace, but also sincere cooperation in their own interests,\r\n    as well as in those of Europe and of the whole world. Unless you\r\n    credit the French people with a lower sense of honor, than I\r\n    credit the German Nation with; you cannot doubt that France\r\n    loyally fulfills her obligations towards other powers, such as\r\n    Poland, which as I am fully convinced, wants to live in peace\r\n    with Germany.\r\n\r\n    “These two convictions are fully compatible.\r\n\r\n    “Till now there has been nothing to prevent a peaceful solution\r\n    of the international crisis, with all honor and dignity for all\r\n    nations, if the same will for peace exists on all sides.\r\n\r\n    “Together with the good will of France I proclaim that of all\r\n    her allies. I take it upon myself to guarantee Poland’s\r\n    readiness, which she has always shown to submit to the mutual\r\n    application of a method of open settlement, as it can be\r\n    imagined between the governments of two sovereign nations. With\r\n    the clearest conscience I can assure you that among the\r\n    differences which have arisen between Germany and Poland over,\r\n    the question of Danzig, there is not one which could not be\r\n    submitted to such a method, the purpose of reaching a peaceful\r\n    and just solution.\r\n\r\n    “Moreover, I can declare on my honor that there is nothing in\r\n    France’s clear and loyal solidarity with Poland and her allies,\r\n    which could in any way prejudice the peaceful attitude of my\r\n    country. This solidarity has never prevented us, and does not\r\n    prevent us today, from keeping Poland in the same friendly state\r\n    of mind.\r\n\r\n    “In so serious an hour, I sincerely believe that no high-minded\r\n    human being could understand it, if a war of destruction was\r\n    started without a last attempt being made to reach a peaceful\r\n    settlement between Germany and Poland. Your desire for peace\r\n    could in all certainty work for this aim, without any prejudice\r\n    to German honor. I, who desire good harmony between the French\r\n    and the German people, and who am on the other hand bound to\r\n    Poland by bonds of friendship, and by a promise, am prepared, as\r\n    head of the French government, to do everything an upright man\r\n    can do to bring this attempt to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\n    “You and I were in the trenches in the last war. You know, as I\r\n    do, what horror and condemnation the devastations of that war\r\n    have left in the conscience of the peoples; without any regard\r\n    to its outcome. The picture I can see in my mind’s eye of your\r\n    outstanding role as the leader of the German people on the road\r\n    of peace, towards the fulfillment of its task in the common work\r\n    of civilization, leads me to ask for a reply to this suggestion.\r\n\r\n    “If French and German blood should be shed again, as it was shed\r\n    25 years ago, in a still longer and more murderous war, then\r\n    each of the two nations will fight, believing in its own\r\n    victory. But the most certain victors will be—destruction and\r\n    barbarity.” (_TC-78_)\r\n\r\nOn 27 August Hitler replied to M. Daladier’s letter of 26 August. The\r\nsense of it was very much the same as that which he wrote to the British\r\nPrime Minister in answer to the letter which he had received from him\r\nearlier in the week. (_TC-79_)\r\n\r\nAfter the letters from Chamberlain and Daladier, the German Government\r\ncould no longer be in any doubt as to the position of both the British\r\nand French Governments in the event of German aggression against Poland.\r\nBut the pleas for peace did not end there. On 24 August President\r\nRoosevelt wrote to both Hitler and to the President of the Polish\r\nRepublic (_TC-72 No. 124_). His letter stated in part:\r\n\r\n    “In the message which I sent to you on the 14th April, I stated\r\n    that it appeared to me that the leaders of great nations had it\r\n    in their power to liberate their peoples from the disaster that\r\n    impended, but that unless the effort were immediately made with\r\n    good will on all sides to find a peaceful and constructive\r\n    solution to existing controversies, the crisis which the world\r\n    was confronting must end in catastrophe. Today that catastrophe\r\n    appears to be very near at hand indeed.\r\n\r\n    “To the message which I sent you last April I have received no\r\n    reply, but because my confident belief that the cause of world\r\n    peace—which is the cause of humanity itself—rises above all\r\n    other considerations, I am again addressing myself to you, with\r\n    the hope that the war which impends and the consequent disaster\r\n    to all peoples may yet be averted.\r\n\r\n    “I therefore urge with all earnestness—and I am likewise urging\r\n    the President of the Republic of Poland—that the Government of\r\n    Germany and Poland agree by common accord to refrain from any\r\n    positive act of hostility for a reasonable stipulated period,\r\n    and that they agree, likewise by common accord, to solve the\r\n    controversies which have arisen between them by one of the three\r\n    following methods:\r\n\r\n    “First, by direct negotiation;\r\n\r\n    “Second, by the submission of these controversies to an\r\n    impartial arbitration in which they can both have confidence; or\r\n\r\n    “Third, that they agree to the solution of these controversies\r\n    through the procedure of conciliation.” (_TC-72 No. 124_).\r\n\r\nHitler’s answer to that letter was the order to his armed forces to\r\ninvade Poland on the following morning. The reply to Mr. Roosevelt’s\r\nletter from the President of the Polish Republic, however, was an\r\nacceptance of the offer to settle the differences by any of the peaceful\r\nmethods suggested. (_TC-72 No. 126_)\r\n\r\nOn 25 August, no reply having been received from the German Government,\r\nPresident Roosevelt wrote again:\r\n\r\n    “I have this hour received from the President of Poland a reply\r\n    to the message which I addressed to your Excellency and to him\r\n    last night.”\r\n\r\nThe Polish reply is then set out.\r\n\r\n    “Your Excellency has repeatedly publicly stated that the aims\r\n    and objects sought by the German Reich were just and reasonable.\r\n\r\n    “In his reply to my message the President of Poland has made it\r\n    plain that the Polish Government is willing, upon the basis set\r\n    forth in my message, to agree to solve the controversy which has\r\n    arisen between the Republic of Poland and the German Reich by\r\n    direct negotiation or the process of conciliation.\r\n\r\n    “Countless human lives can yet be saved and hope may still be\r\n    restored that the nations of the modern world may even now\r\n    construct the foundation for a peaceful and happier\r\n    relationship, if you and the Government of the German Reich will\r\n    agree to the pacific means of settlement accepted by the\r\n    Government of Poland. All the world prays that Germany, too,\r\n    will accept.” (_TC-72 No. 127_)\r\n\r\nBut Germany would not accept those proposals, nor would it pay heed to\r\nthe Pope’s appeal on the same date, 24 August (_TC-72 No. 139_). It is\r\nan appeal in similar terms. There was yet a further appeal from the Pope\r\non 31 August:\r\n\r\n    “The Pope is unwilling to abandon hope that pending negotiations\r\n    may lead to a just pacific solution such as the whole world\r\n    continues to pray for.” (_TC-72 No. 141_).\r\n\r\nThose negotiations, on the last days of August, to which the Pope\r\nreferred as “pending negotiations”, were unhappily, completely bogus\r\nnegotiations insofar as Germany was concerned. They were put forward\r\nsimply as an endeavor to dissuade England, either by threat or by bribe,\r\nfrom meeting her obligations to Poland. The final German “offers” were\r\nno offers in the accepted sense of the word. There was never any\r\nintention behind them of entering into discussions, negotiation,\r\narbitration, or any other form of peaceful settlement with Poland. They\r\nwere merely an attempt to make it easier to seize and conquer Poland\r\nthan it would likely be if England and France were to observe the\r\nobligations they had undertaken.\r\n\r\n(6) _Events of the Last Week in August, 1939._ This was the progress of\r\nthose last negotiations: On 22 August the German-Soviet Pact was signed.\r\nOn 24 August, orders were given to the German armies to march the\r\nfollowing morning. After those orders had been given, the news\r\napparently reached the German Government that the British and Polish\r\nGovernments had signed a formal pact of nonaggression and of mutual\r\nassistance. Up until that time, the position was that the British Prime\r\nMinister had made a statement in the House of Commons and a joint\r\ncommunique had been issued, on 6 April, that the two nations would in\r\nfact assist one another if either were attacked; but no formal agreement\r\nhad been signed.\r\n\r\nNow, on 24 August, after the orders to march had been given by Hitler,\r\nthe news came that such a formal document had been signed. The invasion\r\nwas thereupon postponed for the sole purpose of making one last effort\r\nto keep England and France out of the war—not to cancel the war, but\r\nsolely to keep England and France out of it. On 25 August, having\r\npostponed the invasion, Hitler issued a verbal communique to Sir Neville\r\nHenderson, the British ambassador in Berlin, which was a mixture of\r\nbribe and threat, and with which he hoped to persuade England to keep\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOn 28 August, Sir Neville Henderson handed the British Government’s\r\nreply to that communique to Hitler. That reply stressed that the\r\ndifferences ought to be settled by agreement. The British Government put\r\nforward the view that Danzig should be guaranteed, and that any\r\nagreement reached should be guaranteed by other powers. Whether or not\r\nthese proposals would have been acceptable or unacceptable to Germany\r\nare of no great matter. For once it had been made clear—as it was in\r\nthe British Government’s reply of 28 August—that England would not be\r\nput off assisting Poland in the event of German aggression, the German\r\nGovernment had no concern with further negotiation but was concerned\r\nonly to afford itself some kind of justification and to prevent itself\r\nfrom appearing too blatantly to turn down all the appeals to reason that\r\nwere being put forward.\r\n\r\nOn 29 August, at 7:15 p. m. in the evening, Hitler handed to Sir Neville\r\nHenderson the German Government’s answer to the British Government’s\r\nreply of the 28th. It seems quite clear that the whole object of this\r\nletter was to put forward something which was quite unacceptable. Hitler\r\nagreed to enter into direct conversations as suggested by the British\r\nGovernment, but he demanded that those conversations must be based upon\r\nthe return to the Reich, of Danzig and also of the whole of the\r\nCorridor.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that hitherto, even when he had alleged that Poland\r\nhad renounced the 1934 agreement, Hitler had put forward as his demands\r\nthe return of Danzig alone, plus the arrangement for an\r\nextra-territorial Autobahn and railroad running through the Corridor to\r\nEast Prussia. That demand was unacceptable at that time. To make quite\r\ncertain of refusal, Hitler now demanded the whole of the Corridor. There\r\nwas no question of an Autobahn or railway. The whole territory must\r\nbecome German.\r\n\r\nEven so, to make doubly certain that the offer would not be accepted,\r\nHitler stated: “On those terms I am prepared to enter into discussion,\r\nbut to do so, as the matter is urgent, I expect a plenipotentiary with\r\nfull powers from the Polish Government to be here in Berlin by midnight\r\ntomorrow night, the 30th of August.”\r\n\r\nThis offer was made at 7:15 p. m. on the evening of the 29th. That offer\r\nhad to be transmitted, first, to London; and from London to Warsaw; and\r\nfrom Warsaw the Polish Government had to give authority to their\r\nAmbassador in Berlin. So that the timing made it quite impossible, if\r\nindeed it were possible, to get authority to the Polish Ambassador in\r\nBerlin by midnight the following night. It allowed Poland no opportunity\r\nfor discussing the matters at all. As Sir Neville Henderson described\r\nit, the offer amounted to an ultimatum.\r\n\r\nAt midnight on 30 August, at the time by which the Polish\r\nPlenipotentiary was expected to arrive, Sir Neville Henderson handed a\r\nfurther message to Ribbentrop in reply to the message that had been\r\nhanded to him the previous evening. Ribbentrop read out in German a\r\ntwo- or three-page document which purported to be the German proposal to\r\nbe discussed at the discussions between them and the Polish Government.\r\nHe read it out quickly in German. He refused to hand a copy of it to the\r\nBritish Ambassador. He passed no copy of it at all to the Polish\r\nAmbassador. So that there was no kind of possible chance of the Poles\r\never having before them the proposals which Germany was so graciously\r\nand magnanimously offering to discuss.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, 31 August, Mr. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador, saw\r\nRibbentrop, and could get no further than to be asked whether he came\r\nwith full powers. When he replied that he did not, Ribbentrop said that\r\nhe would put the position before the Fuehrer. But, in actual fact, it\r\nwas much too late to put any position to the Fuehrer by that time,\r\nbecause on 31 August Hitler had already issued his Directive No. 1 for\r\nthe conduct of war, in which he laid down H-Hour as being a quarter to\r\nfive the following morning, 1 September. And on the evening of 31\r\nAugust, at 9 o’clock, the German radio broadcast the proposals which\r\nRibbentrop had read out to Sir Neville Henderson the night before,\r\nsaying that these were the proposals which had been made for discussion,\r\nbut that as no Polish Plenipotentiary had arrived to discuss them, the\r\nGerman Government assumed that they were turned down. That broadcast at\r\n9 o’clock on the evening of 31 August was the first that the Poles had\r\never heard of the proposal, and it was the first that the British\r\nGovernment or its representatives in Berlin knew about them, other than\r\nwhat had been heard when Ribbentrop had read them out and refused to\r\ngive a written copy on the evening of the 30th.\r\n\r\nAfter that broadcast, at 9:15—perhaps while the broadcast was still in\r\nits course—a copy of those proposals was handed to Sir Neville\r\nHenderson for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis summary of events during that last week of August 1939 is based\r\nupon the contents of several documents which will now be alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn a pre-trial interrogation on 29 August 1945, Goering was asked the\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n    “When the negotiations of the Polish Foreign Minister in London\r\n    brought about the Anglo-Polish Treaty at the end of March or the\r\n    beginning of April, was it not fairly obvious that a peaceful\r\n    solution was impossible?” (_TC-90_)\r\n\r\nThis was Goering’s answer:\r\n\r\n    “Yes, it seemed impossible according to my conviction, but not\r\n    according to the convictions of the Fuehrer. When it was\r\n    mentioned to the Fuehrer that England had given her guarantee to\r\n    Poland, he said that England was also guaranteeing Rumania, but\r\n    then when the Russians took Bessarabia nothing happened, and\r\n    this made a big impression on him. I made a mistake here. At\r\n    this time Poland only had the promise of a guarantee. The\r\n    guarantee itself was only given shortly before the beginning of\r\n    the war. On the day when England gave her official guarantee to\r\n    Poland the Fuehrer called me on the telephone and told me that\r\n    he had stopped the planned invasion of Poland. I asked him then\r\n    whether this was just temporary or for good. He said, ‘No, I\r\n    will have to see whether we can eliminate British intervention.’\r\n    So then I asked him, ‘Do you think that it will be any different\r\n    within four or five days?’ At this same time—I don’t know\r\n    whether you know about that, Colonel—I was in connection with\r\n    Lord Halifax by a special courier outside the regular diplomatic\r\n    channels to do everything to stop war with England. After the\r\n    guarantee I held an English declaration of war inevitable. I\r\n    already told him in the Spring of 1939 after occupying\r\n    Czechoslovakia, I told him that from now on if he tried to solve\r\n    the Polish question he would have to count on the enmity of\r\n    England. 1939, that is after the Protectorate.” (_TC-90_)\r\n\r\nThe interrogation of Goering proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Question: ‘Is it not a fact that preparations for the campaign\r\n    against Poland were originally supposed to have been completed\r\n    by the end of August 1939?’\r\n\r\n    “Answer: ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n    “Question: ‘And that the final issuance of the order for the\r\n    campaign against Poland came some time between the 15th and 20th\r\n    of August 1939 after the signing of the treaty with Soviet\r\n    Russia.’ [The dates obviously are wrong].\r\n\r\n    “Answer: ‘Yes, that is true.’\r\n\r\n    “Question: ‘Is it not also a fact that the start of the campaign\r\n    was ordered for the 25th of August, but on the 24th of August in\r\n    the afternoon it was postponed until September the 1st in order\r\n    to await the results of new diplomatic maneuvers with the\r\n    English Ambassador?’\r\n\r\n    “Answer: ‘Yes.’” (_TC-90_)\r\n\r\nIn this interrogation Goering purported not to have wanted war with\r\nEngland. It will be recalled, however, that after the speech of Hitler\r\non 22 August to his commanders-in-chief, Goering got up and thanked the\r\nFuehrer for his exhortation and assured him that the armed forces would\r\nplay their part. (_798-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler’s verbal communique, as it is called in the British Blue Book,\r\nwhich he handed to Sir Neville Henderson on 25 August, after he had\r\nheard of the signing of the Anglo-Polish agreement, in an endeavor to\r\nkeep England from aiding Poland, commences by stating Hitler’s desire to\r\nmake one more effort to prevent war. In the second paragraph he asserts\r\nagain that Poland’s provocations were unbearable:\r\n\r\n    “Germany was in all circumstances determined to abolish these\r\n    Macedonian conditions on her eastern frontier and, what is more,\r\n    to do so in the interests of quiet and order, but also in the\r\n    interests of European peace.\r\n\r\n    “The problem of Danzig and the Corridor must be solved. The\r\n    British Prime Minister had made a speech which was not in the\r\n    least calculated to induce any change in the German attitude. At\r\n    the most, the result of this speech could be a bloody and\r\n    incalculable war between Germany and England. Such a war would\r\n    be bloodier than that of 1914 to 1918. In contrast to the last\r\n    war, Germany would no longer have to fight on two fronts.\r\n    Agreement with Russia was unconditional and signified a change\r\n    in foreign policy of the Reich which would last a very long\r\n    time. Russia and Germany would never again take up arms against\r\n    each other. Apart from this, the agreements reached with Russia\r\n    would also render Germany secure economically for the longest\r\n    period of war.” (_TC-72 No. 68_)\r\n\r\nThen comes the bribe.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer declared the German-Polish problem must be solved\r\n    and will be solved. He is however prepared and determined after\r\n    the solution of this problem to approach England once more with\r\n    a large, comprehensive offer. He is a man of great decisions,\r\n    and in this case also he will be capable of being great in his\r\n    action. And then magnanimously he accepts the British Empire and\r\n    is ready to pledge himself personally for its continued\r\n    existence and to place the power of the German Reich at its\r\n    disposal on condition that his colonial demands, which are\r\n    limited, should be negotiated by peaceful means. * * *” (_TC-72\r\n    No. 68_)\r\n\r\nAgain Hitler stressed irrevocable determination never to enter into war\r\nwith Russia. He concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “If the British Government would consider these ideas a blessing\r\n    for Germany and also for the British empire, a peace might\r\n    result. If it rejects these ideas there will be war. In no case\r\n    will Great Britain emerge stronger; the last war proved it. The\r\n    Fuehrer repeats that he himself is a man of ad infinitum\r\n    decisions by which he is bound, and that this is his last\r\n    offer.” (_TC-72 No. 68_)\r\n\r\nThe British Government was not of course aware of the real object that\r\nlay behind that message, and, taking it at its face value, wrote back oh\r\n28 August saying that they were prepared to enter into discussions. They\r\nagreed with Hitler that the differences must be settled, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government a reasonable\r\n    solution of the differences between Germany and Poland could and\r\n    should be effected by agreement between the two countries on\r\n    lines which would include the safeguarding of Poland’s essential\r\n    interests, and they recall that in his speech of the 28th of\r\n    April the German Chancellor recognized the importance of these\r\n    interests to Poland.\r\n\r\n    “But as was stated by the Prime Minister in his letter to the\r\n    German Chancellor of the 22nd of August, His Majesty’s\r\n    Government consider it essential for the success of the\r\n    discussions which would precede the agreement that it should be\r\n    understood beforehand that any settlement arrived at would be\r\n    guaranteed by other powers. His Majesty’s Government would be\r\n    ready if desired to make their contribution to the effective\r\n    operation of such a guarantee.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “His Majesty’s Government have said enough to make their own\r\n    attitude plain in the particular matters at issue between\r\n    Germany and Poland. They trust that the German Chancellor will\r\n    not think that, because His Majesty’s Government are scrupulous\r\n    concerning their obligations to Poland, they are not anxious to\r\n    use all their influence to assist the achievement of a solution\r\n    which may commend itself both to Germany and to Poland.” (_TC-72\r\n    No. 74_)\r\n\r\nThat reply knocked the German hopes on the head. The Nazis had failed\r\ndespite their tricks and their bribes to dissuade England from observing\r\nher obligations to Poland, and it was now only a matter of getting out\r\nof their embarrassment as quickly as possible and saving face as much as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn his interview with Hitler, Sir Neville Henderson emphasized the\r\nBritish attitude that they were determined in any event to meet their\r\nobligations to Poland. The interview concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the end I asked him two straight questions: Was he willing\r\n    to negotiate direct with the Poles? and Was he ready to discuss\r\n    the question of any exchange of population? He replied in the\r\n    affirmative as regards the latter. There I have no doubt that he\r\n    was thinking at the same time of a rectification of frontiers.\r\n    As regards to the first, he said he could not give me an answer\r\n    until after he had given the reply of His Majesty’s Government\r\n    the careful consideration which such a document deserved. In\r\n    this connection he turned to Ribbentrop and said, ‘We must\r\n    summon Field Marshal Goering to discuss it with him.’” (_TC-72\r\n    No. 75_)\r\n\r\nThe German reply, as outlined before, was handed to Sir Neville\r\nHenderson at 7.15 P. M. on 29 August. The reply sets out the suggestion\r\nsubmitted by the British Government in a previous note, and goes on to\r\nsay that the German Government is prepared to enter into discussion on\r\nthe basis that the whole of the Corridor as well as Danzig shall be\r\nreturned to the Reich. The reply continues:\r\n\r\n    “The demands of the German Government are in conformity with the\r\n    revision of the Versailles Treaty in regard to this territory\r\n    which has always been recognized as being necessary; viz.,\r\n    return of Danzig and the Corridor to Germany, the safeguarding\r\n    of the existence of the German national group in the territories\r\n    remaining to Poland.” (_TC-72 No. 78_)\r\n\r\nIt is only just now, as I emphasized before, that the right to the\r\nCorridor has been “recognized” for so long. On 28 April, Hitler demands\r\nconsisted only of Danzig, the Autobahn, and the railway. But now\r\nHitler’s aim was to manufacture justification and to put forth proposals\r\nwhich under no circumstances could either Poland or Great Britain\r\naccept. The note states:\r\n\r\n    “The British Government attach importance to two considerations:\r\n    (1) that the existing danger of an imminent explosion should be\r\n    eliminated as quickly as possible by direct negotiation, and (2)\r\n    that the existence of the Polish State, in the form in which it\r\n    would then continue to exist, should be adequately safeguarded\r\n    in the economic and political sphere by means of international\r\n    guarantees.\r\n\r\n    “On this subject, the German Government makes the following\r\n    declaration:\r\n\r\n    “Though skeptical as to the prospects of a successful outcome,\r\n    they are nevertheless prepared to accept the English proposal\r\n    and to enter into direct discussions. They do so, as has already\r\n    been emphasized, solely as the result of the impression made\r\n    upon them by the written statement received from the British\r\n    Government that they too desire a pact of friendship in\r\n    accordance with the general lines indicated to the British\r\n    Ambassador.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “For the rest, in making these proposals the German Government\r\n    have never had any intention of touching Poland’s vital\r\n    interests of questioning the existence of an independent Polish\r\n    State. The German Government, accordingly, in these\r\n    circumstances agree to accept the British Government’s offer of\r\n    their good offices in securing the despatch to Berlin of a\r\n    Polish Emissary with full powers. They count on the arrival of\r\n    this Emissary on Wednesday, the 30th August, 1939.\r\n\r\n    “The German Government will immediately draw up proposals for a\r\n    solution acceptable to themselves and will, if possible, place\r\n    these at the disposal of the British Government before the\r\n    arrival of the Polish negotiators.” (_TC-72 No. 78_)\r\n\r\nThat was at 7:15 in the evening of 29 August. As previously explained,\r\ninsufficient time was allowed for the Polish Emissary to reach Berlin by\r\nmidnight the following night.\r\n\r\nSir Neville Henderson’s account of his interview on the evening of 29\r\nAugust summarizes what took place then:\r\n\r\n    “I remarked that this phrase sounded like an ultimatum, but\r\n    after some heated remarks both Herr Hitler and Herr von\r\n    Ribbentrop assured me that it was only intended to stress\r\n    urgency of the moment when the two fully mobilized armies were\r\n    standing face to face.” (_TC-72 No. 79_)\r\n\r\nAgain the British Government replied and Sir Neville Henderson handed\r\nthis reply to Ribbentrop at the famous meeting on midnight of 30 August,\r\nat the time the Polish Emissary had been expected. The reply stated that\r\nthe British Government reciprocated the desire for improved relations.\r\nIt stressed again that it cannot sacrifice its interest to other friends\r\nin order to obtain an improvement in the situation. It understood that\r\nthe German Government accepts the condition that the settlement should\r\nbe subject to international guarantee. The British Government makes a\r\nreservation as to the demands that the Germans put forward in their last\r\nletter, and is informing the Polish Government immediately. Lastly, the\r\nBritish understand that the German Government is drawing up the\r\nproposals. (_TC-72 No. 89_)\r\n\r\nSir Neville Henderson gave this account of that interview at midnight on\r\n30 August:\r\n\r\n    “I told Herr von Ribbentrop this evening that His Majesty’s\r\n    Government found it difficult to advise Polish Government to\r\n    accept procedure adumbrated in German reply, and suggested that\r\n    he should adopt normal contact, i.e., that when German proposals\r\n    were ready to invite Polish Ambassador to call and to hand him\r\n    proposals for transmission to his Government with a view to\r\n    immediate opening of negotiations. I added that if basis\r\n    afforded prospect of settlement His Majesty’s Government could\r\n    be counted upon to do their best in Warsaw to temporize\r\n    negotiations.\r\n\r\n    “Herr von Ribbentrop’s reply was to produce a lengthy document\r\n    which he read out in German aloud at top speed. Imagining that\r\n    he would eventually hand it to me I did not attempt to follow\r\n    too closely the sixteen or more articles which it contained.\r\n    Though I cannot therefore guarantee accuracy the main points\r\n    were: * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “When I asked Herr von Ribbentrop for text of these proposals in\r\n    accordance with undertaking the German reply of yesterday, he\r\n    asserted that it was now too late as Polish representative had\r\n    not arrived in Berlin by midnight.\r\n\r\n    “I observed that to treat matter in this way meant that request\r\n    for Polish representative to arrive in Berlin on 30th August\r\n    constituted in fact, an ultimatum in spite of what he and Herr\r\n    Hitler had assured me yesterday. This he denied, saying that\r\n    idea of an ultimatum was figment of my imagination. Why then I\r\n    asked could he not adopt normal procedure and give me copy of\r\n    proposals and ask Polish Ambassador to call on him, just as Herr\r\n    Hitler had summoned me a few days ago, and hand them to him for\r\n    communication to Polish Government. In the most violent terms\r\n    Herr von Ribbentrop said that he would never ask the Ambassador\r\n    to visit him. He hinted that if Polish Ambassador asked him for\r\n    interview it might be different. I said that I would naturally\r\n    inform my Government so at once. Whereupon he said while those\r\n    were his personal views he would bring all that I had said to\r\n    Herr Hitler’s notice. It was for Chancellor to decide.\r\n\r\n    “We parted on that note, but I must tell you that Herr von\r\n    Ribbentrop’s demeanor during an unpleasant interview was aping\r\n    Herr Hitler at his worst. He inveighed incidentally against\r\n    Polish mobilization, but I retorted that it was hardly\r\n    surprising since Germany had also mobilized as Herr Hitler\r\n    himself had admitted to me yesterday.” (_TC-72 No. 92_)\r\n\r\nHenderson of course did not know at that time that Germany had also\r\ngiven the orders to attack Poland some days before. On the following\r\nday, 31 August, at 6:30 in the evening, M. Lipski, the Polish\r\nAmbassador, had an interview with Ribbentrop. This is M. Lipski’s\r\naccount of the conversation:\r\n\r\n    “I carried out my instructions. M. von Ribbentrop asked if I had\r\n    special plenipotentiary powers to undertake negotiations. I said\r\n    no. He then asked whether I had been informed that on London’s\r\n    suggestion the German Government had expressed their readiness\r\n    to negotiate directly with a delegate of the Polish Government,\r\n    furnished with the requisite full powers, who was to have\r\n    arrived on the preceding day, August 30. I replied that I had no\r\n    direct information on the subject. In conclusion M. von\r\n    Ribbentrop repeated that he had thought I would be empowered to\r\n    negotiate. He would communicate my demarche to the Chancellor.”\r\n    (_TC-73 No. 112_)\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. The orders had already been given on that day to\r\nthe German Army to invade. A “Most Secret order” signed by Hitler,\r\ndescribed as his “Direction No. 1 for the conduct of the war,” dated 31\r\nAugust 1939, reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “Now that all the political possibilities of disposing by\r\n    peaceful means of a situation of the Eastern Frontier which is\r\n    intolerable for Germany are exhausted, I have determined on a\r\n    solution by force.\r\n\r\n    “The attack on Poland is to be carried out in accordance with\r\n    the preparations made for ‘_Fall Weiss_’, with the alterations\r\n    which result, where the Army is concerned, from the fact that it\r\n    has in the meantime almost completed its dispositions.\r\n\r\n    “Allotment of tasks and the operational target remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n    “Date of attack—1 September 1939\r\n\r\n    “Time of attack—04:45 [inserted in red pencil]\r\n\r\n    “This time also applies to the operation at Gdynia, Bay of\r\n    Danzig and the Dirschau Bridge.\r\n\r\n    “In the West it is important that the responsibility for the\r\n    opening of hostilities should rest unequivocally with England\r\n    and France. At first purely local action should be taken against\r\n    insignificant frontier violations.” (_C-126_)\r\n\r\nThat evening, 31 August, at nine o’clock, the German radio broadcast the\r\nterms of the German proposals about which they were willing to enter\r\ninto discussions with the Polish Government. The proposals were set out\r\nat length. By this time, neither Sir Neville Henderson nor the Polish\r\nGovernment nor their Ambassador had yet been given their written copy of\r\nthem. This is a document which seems difficult to explain other than as\r\nan exhibition or an example of hypocrisy. The second paragraph states:\r\n\r\n    “Further, the German Government pointed out that they felt able\r\n    to make the basic points regarding the offer of an understanding\r\n    available to the British Government by the time the Polish\r\n    negotiator arrived in Berlin.”\r\n\r\nThe manner in which they did that has been shown. The German Broadcast\r\ncontinued, that instead of the arrival of an authorized Polish\r\npersonage, the first answer the Government of the Reich received to\r\ntheir readiness for an understanding was the news of the Polish\r\nmobilization; and that only toward 12 o’clock on the night of 30 August\r\n1939 did they receive a somewhat general assurance of British readiness\r\nto help towards the commencement of negotiations. The fact that the\r\nPolish negotiator expected by the Reich did not arrive, removed the\r\nnecessary conditions for informing His Majesty’s Government of the views\r\nof the German Government as regards the possible basis for negotiation.\r\nSince His Majesty’s Government themselves had pleaded for direct\r\nnegotiations between Germany and Poland, the German Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Ribbentrop, gave the British Ambassador on the occasion of the\r\npresentation of the last British note, precise information as to the\r\ntext of the German proposals which will be regarded as a basis for\r\nnegotiation in the event of the arrival of the Polish Plenipotentiary.\r\nThe Broadcast thereafter went on to set out the Nazi version of the\r\nstory of the negotiations over the last few days. (_TC-73 No. 113_)\r\n\r\nOn 1 September, when his armies were already crossing the Polish\r\nfrontier, Hitler issued this proclamation to his Armed Forces:\r\n\r\n    “The Polish Government, unwilling to establish good neighborly\r\n    relations as aimed at by me, wants to force the issue by way of\r\n    arms.\r\n\r\n    “The Germans in Poland are being persecuted with bloody terror\r\n    and driven from their homes. Several acts of frontier violation\r\n    which cannot be tolerated by a great power show that Poland is\r\n    no longer prepared to respect the Reich’s frontiers. To put an\r\n    end to these mad acts I can see no other way but from now\r\n    onwards to meet force with force.\r\n\r\n    “The German Armed Forces will with firm determination take up\r\n    the struggle for the honor and the vital rights of the German\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n    “I expect every soldier to be conscious of the high tradition of\r\n    the eternal German soldierly qualities and to do his duty to the\r\n    last.\r\n\r\n    “Remember always and in any circumstances that you are the\r\n    representatives of National Socialist Greater Germany.\r\n\r\n    “Long live our people and the Reich.” (_TC-54_)\r\n\r\nSo that at last Hitler had kept his word to his generals. He had\r\nafforded them their propagandistic justification, and at that time,\r\nanyway, it did not matter what people said about it afterwards.\r\n\r\n    “The view shall not appear, asked later on, whether we told the\r\n    truth or not. Might is what counts—or victory is what counts\r\n    and not right.” (_1014-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn that day, 1 September, when news came of this invasion of Polish\r\nground, the British Government, in accordance with their treaty\r\nobligations, sent an ultimatum to the German Government, in which it\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “I am accordingly to inform your Excellency that unless the\r\n    German Government are prepared to give His Majesty’s Government\r\n    satisfactory assurances that the German Government have\r\n    suspended all aggressive action against Poland and are prepared\r\n    promptly to withdraw their forces from Polish territory, His\r\n    Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will without\r\n    hesitation fulfill their obligations to Poland.” (_TC-72 No.\r\n    110_)\r\n\r\nAt 9 o’clock on 3 September the British Government handed a final\r\nultimatum to the German Minister of Foreign Affairs. It read in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Although this communication was made more than\r\n    twenty-four hours ago, no reply has been received but German\r\n    attacks upon Poland have been continued and intensified. I have\r\n    accordingly the honor to inform you that, unless not later than\r\n    eleven o’clock, British Summer Time, today 3d September,\r\n    satisfactory assurances to the above effect have been given by\r\n    the German Government, and have reached His Majesty’s Government\r\n    in London, a state of war will exist between the two countries\r\n    as from that hour.” (_TC-72 No. 118_)\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that at 11 o’clock on 3 September a state of war existed\r\nbetween Germany and England and between Germany and France. The plans,\r\npreparations, intentions, and determination to carry out this assault\r\nupon Poland which had been going on for months, for years before, had\r\ncome to fruition despite all appeals to peace, all appeals to reason. It\r\nmattered not what anybody but the German Government had in mind or\r\nwhatever rights anybody else but the German nation thought they had. If\r\nthere is any doubt left about this matter, two more documents remain for\r\nconsideration. Even now, on 3 September, Mussolini offered some chance\r\nof peace. At 6:30 hours on 3 September Mussolini sent a telegram to\r\nHitler:\r\n\r\n    “The Italian Ambassador handed to the State Secretary at the\r\n    Duce’s order following copy for the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor\r\n    and for the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs:\r\n\r\n    “Italy sends the information, leaving, of course, every decision\r\n    to the Fuehrer, that it still has a chance to call a conference\r\n    with France, England and Poland on following basis: 1. Armistice\r\n    which would leave the Army Corps where they are at present. 2.\r\n    Calling the conference within two or three days. 3. Solution of\r\n    the Polish-German controversy which would be certainly favorable\r\n    for Germany as matters stand today.\r\n\r\n    “This idea which originated from the Duce has its foremost\r\n    exponent in France.\r\n\r\n    “Danzig is already German and Germany is holding already\r\n    securities which guarantee most of her demands. Besides, Germany\r\n    has had already its ‘moral satisfaction.’ If it would accept the\r\n    plan for a conference, it will achieve all her aims and at the\r\n    same time prevent a war which already today has the aspect of\r\n    being universal and of extremely long duration.” (_1831-PS_)\r\n\r\nPerhaps even Mussolini did not appreciate what all Germany’s aims were,\r\nfor his offer was turned down in the illuminating letter which Hitler\r\nwas to write in reply:\r\n\r\n    “Duce:\r\n\r\n    “I first want to thank you for your last attempt at mediation. I\r\n    would have been ready to accept, but only under condition, that\r\n    there would be a possibility to give me certain guarantees that\r\n    the conference would be successful. Because, for the last two\r\n    days the German troops are engaged in an extraordinarily rapid\r\n    advance in Poland. It would have been impossible to devaluate\r\n    the bloody sacrifices made thereby by diplomatic intrigues.\r\n    Nevertheless, I believe that a way could have been found, if\r\n    England would not have been determined to wage war under all\r\n    circumstances. I have not given in to the English, because,\r\n    Duce, I do not believe that peace could have been maintained for\r\n    more than one-half year or one year. Under these circumstances,\r\n    I thought that, in spite of everything, the present moment was\r\n    better for resistance. At present, the superiority of the German\r\n    armed forces in Poland is so overwhelming in all fields that the\r\n    Polish Army will collapse in a very short time. I doubt whether\r\n    this fast success could be achieved in one or two years. England\r\n    and France would have armed their allies, to such an extent that\r\n    the crushing technical superiority of the German Armed Forces\r\n    could not have become so apparent anymore. I am aware, Duce,\r\n    that the fight which I enter, is one for life and death. My own\r\n    fate does not play any role in it at all. But I am also aware\r\n    that one cannot avoid such a struggle permanently and that one\r\n    has to choose after cold deliberation the moment for resistance\r\n    in such a way that the probability of the success is guaranteed\r\n    and I believe in this success, Duce, with the firmness of a\r\n    rock. Recently you have given me the kind assurance that you\r\n    think you will be able to help me in a few fields. I acknowledge\r\n    this in advance with, sincere thanks. But I believe also—even\r\n    if we march now over different roads—that fate will finally\r\n    join us. If the National Socialist Germany were destroyed by the\r\n    Western democracies, the Fascist Italy would also have to face a\r\n    grave future. I was personally always aware of this community of\r\n    the future of our two governments and I know that you, Duce,\r\n    think the same way. To the situation in Poland, I would like to\r\n    make the brief remark that we lay aside, of course, all\r\n    unimportant things, that we do not waste any man in unimportant\r\n    tasks, but direct all on acts in the light of great operational\r\n    considerations. The Northern Polish Army which is the Corridor,\r\n    has already been completely encircled by our action. It will be\r\n    either wiped out or will surrender. Otherwise, all operations\r\n    proceed according to plan. The daily achievements of the troops\r\n    are far beyond all expectations.

AGGRESSION AGAINST NORWAY AND DENMARK\r\n\r\nIn the early hours of the morning of 9 April 1940 Nazi Germany invaded\r\nNorway and Denmark. Those invasions constituted wars of aggression, and\r\nalso wars in violation of international treaties, agreements, and\r\nassurances.\r\n\r\nA. _Treaties and Assurances Violated._\r\n\r\nThe invasions constituted violations of the Hague Convention and of the\r\nKellogg-Briand Pact. In addition there were specific agreements between\r\nGermany and Norway and Denmark. There was the Treaty of Arbitration and\r\nConciliation between Germany and Denmark, which was signed at Berlin on\r\n2 June, 1926 (_TC-17_). The first Article of that Treaty is in these\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n    “The Contracting Parties undertake to submit to the procedure of\r\n    arbitration or conciliation, in conformity with the present\r\n    Treaty, all disputes of any nature whatsoever which may arise\r\n    between Germany and Denmark and which it has not been possible\r\n    to settle within a reasonable period by diplomacy or to bring\r\n    with the consent of both Parties before the Permanent Court of\r\n    International Justice.\r\n\r\n    “Disputes for the solution of which a special procedure has been\r\n    laid down in other Conventions in force between the Contracting\r\n    Parties shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of\r\n    such Conventions.” (_TC-17_)\r\n\r\nThe remaining Articles deal with the machinery for arbitration.\r\n\r\nThere was also the treaty of nonaggression between Germany and Denmark\r\nwhich was signed by Ribbentrop on 31 May 1939, ten weeks after the Nazi\r\nseizure of Czechoslovakia (_TC-24_). The preamble and Articles 1 and 2\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n    “His Majesty the King of Denmark and Iceland and the Chancellor\r\n    of the German Reich,\r\n\r\n    “Being firmly resolved to maintain peace between Denmark and\r\n    Germany in all circumstances, have agreed to confirm this\r\n    resolve by means of a treaty and have appointed as their\r\n    Plenipotentiaries: His Majesty the King of Denmark and Iceland\r\n    and the Chancellor of the German Reich.\r\n\r\n    “Article I: The Kingdom of Denmark and the German Reich shall in\r\n    no case resort to war or to any other use of force one against\r\n    the other.\r\n\r\n    “Should action of the kind referred to in Paragraph 1 be taken\r\n    by a third Power against one of the Contracting Parties, the\r\n    other Contracting Party shall not support such action in any\r\n    way.\r\n\r\n    “Article II: The Treaty shall come into force on the exchange of\r\n    the instruments of ratification and shall remain in force for a\r\n    period of ten years from that date.” (_TC-24_)\r\n\r\nThe Treaty is dated 31 May 1939. At the bottom of the page there appears\r\nthe signature of Ribbentrop. The invasion of Denmark by the Nazi forces\r\nless than a year after the signature of this treaty showed the utter\r\nworthlessness of treaties to which Ribbentrop put his signature.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Norway, Ribbentrop and the Nazi conspirators were party\r\nto a similar perfidy. Hitler gave an assurance to Denmark, Norway, and\r\nthe Netherlands on 28 April 1939 (_TC-30_). That, of course, was after\r\nthe annexation of Czechoslovakia had shaken the confidence of the world,\r\nand was presumably an attempt to try to reassure the Scandinavian\r\nStates. Hitler said:\r\n\r\n    “I have given binding declarations to a large number of States.\r\n    None of these States can complain that even a trace of a demand\r\n    contrary thereto has ever been made to them by Germany. None of\r\n    the Scandinavian statesmen, for example, can contend that a\r\n    request has ever been put to them by the German Government or by\r\n    the German public opinion which was incompatible with the\r\n    sovereignty and integrity of their State.\r\n\r\n    “I was pleased that a number of European States availed\r\n    themselves of these declarations by the German Government to\r\n    express and emphasize their desire too for absolute neutrality.\r\n    This applies to Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, etc.”\r\n    (_TC-30_)\r\n\r\nA further assurance was given by the Nazi Government on 2 September\r\n1939, the day after the Nazi invasion of Poland. On that day an aide\r\nmemoire was handed to the Norwegian Foreign Minister by the German\r\nMinister in Oslo. It reads:\r\n\r\n    “The German Reich Government is determined, in view of the\r\n    friendly relations which exist between Norway and Germany, under\r\n    no circumstances, to prejudice the inviolability and integrity\r\n    of Norway and to respect the territory of the Norwegian State.\r\n    In making this declaration the Reich Government naturally\r\n    expects, on its side, that Norway will observe an unimpeachable\r\n    neutrality towards the Reich and will not tolerate any breaches\r\n    of Norwegian neutrality by any third party which might occur.\r\n    Should the attitude of the Royal Norwegian Government differ\r\n    from this so that any such breach of neutrality by a third party\r\n    recurs, the Reich Government would then obviously be compelled\r\n    to safeguard the interests of the Reich in such a way as the\r\n    resulting situation might dictate.” (_TC-31_)\r\n\r\nThere followed a further German assurance to Norway in a speech by\r\nHitler on 6 October 1939 in which he said:\r\n\r\n    “Germany has never had any conflicts of interest or even points\r\n    of controversy with the Northern States; neither has she any\r\n    today. Sweden and Norway have both been offered nonaggression\r\n    pacts by Germany and have both refused them solely because they\r\n    do not feel themselves threatened in any way.” (_TC-32_)\r\n\r\nThese treaties and assurances were the diplomatic background to the Nazi\r\naggression on Norway and Denmark. These assurances were simply given to\r\nlull suspicion and cause the intended victims of Nazi aggression to be\r\nunprepared to meet the Nazi attack. For it is now known that as early as\r\nOctober 1939 the conspirators were plotting the invasion of Norway, and\r\nthat the most active conspirators in that plot were Raeder and\r\nRosenberg.\r\n\r\nB. _Early Planning for Invasion._\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian invasion is in one respect not a typical Nazi aggression,\r\nin that Hitler had to be persuaded to embark upon it. The chief\r\ninstruments of persuasion were Raeder and Rosenberg; Raeder because he\r\nthought Norway strategically important, and because he coveted glory for\r\nhis Navy; Rosenberg because of his political connections in Norway,\r\nwhich he sought to develop. And in the Norwegian, Vidkun Quisling,\r\nRosenberg found a very model of the Fifth Column agent.\r\n\r\nThe early stages of the Nazi conspiracy to invade Norway are disclosed\r\nin a letter which Raeder wrote on 10 January 1944 to Admiral Assmann,\r\nthe official German Naval historian (_C-66_). It is headed “Memorandum\r\nfor Admiral Assmann for his own information; not to be used for\r\npublications.” The first part deals with “Barbarossa” (the plan to\r\ninvade Russia). The next part is headed “(b) _Weseruebung_,” which was\r\nthe code name for the invasion of Norway and Denmark. The following is a\r\npertinent passage from the letter:\r\n\r\n    “During the weeks preceding the report on the 10th of October\r\n    1939, I was in correspondence with Admiral Carls, who, in a\r\n    detailed letter to me, first pointed out the importance of an\r\n    occupation of the Norwegian coast by Germany. I passed this\r\n    letter on to C/SKl (the Chief of Staff of the Naval War Staff)\r\n    for their information and prepared some notes based on this\r\n    letter for my report to the Fuehrer, which I made on the 10th of\r\n    October 1939, since my opinion was identical with that of\r\n    Admiral Carls, while at that time the SKl was more dubious about\r\n    the matter. In these notes, I stressed the disadvantages which\r\n    an occupation of Norway by the British would have for\r\n    us—control of the approaches to the Baltic, outflanking of our\r\n    naval operations and of air attacks on Britain, pressure on\r\n    Sweden. I also stressed the advantages for us of the occupation\r\n    of the Norwegian coast—outlet to the North Atlantic, no\r\n    possibility of a British mine barrier, as in the year 1917-18.\r\n    Naturally at the time, only the coast and bases were considered;\r\n    I included Narvik, though Admiral Carls, in the course of our\r\n    correspondence thought that Narvik could be excluded. The\r\n    Fuehrer saw at once the significance of the Norwegian problem;\r\n    he asked me to leave the notes and stated that he wished to\r\n    consider the question himself.” (_C-66_)\r\n\r\nThis report of Raeder shows that the evolution of this Nazi campaign\r\nagainst Norway affords a good example of the participation of the German\r\nHigh Command in the Nazi conspiracy to attack inoffensive neighbors.\r\n\r\nBefore this report of October 1939 was made to the Fuehrer, Raeder\r\nsought a second opinion on the Norwegian invasion. On 3 October 1939, he\r\nmade out a questionnaire headed, “Gaining of Bases in Norway (extract\r\nfrom War Diary)” (_C-122_). It reads:\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of the Naval War Staff considers it necessary that\r\n    the Fuehrer be informed as soon as possible of the opinions of\r\n    the Naval War Staff on the possibilities of extending the\r\n    operational base to the North. It must be ascertained whether it\r\n    is possible to gain bases in Norway under the combined pressure\r\n    of Russia and Germany, with the aim of improving our strategic\r\n    and operational position. The following questions must be given\r\n    consideration:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) What places in Norway can be considered as bases?\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Can bases be gained by military force against Norway’s\r\n    will, if it is impossible to carry this out without fighting?\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) What are the possibilities of defense after the\r\n    occupation?\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) Will the harbors have to be developed completely as\r\n    bases, or have they already advantages suitable for supply\r\n    position?”\r\n\r\n    “F.O.U.-boats” [a reference to Doenitz] “already considers such\r\n    harbors extremely useful as equipment and supply bases for\r\n    Atlantic U-boats to call at temporarily.”)\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) What decisive advantages would exist for the conduct of\r\n    the war at sea in gaining bases in North Denmark, e.g. Skagen?”\r\n    (_C-122_)\r\n\r\nA memorandum written by Doenitz on Norwegian bases presumably relates to\r\nthe questionnaire of Raeder, which was in circulation about that time.\r\nDoenitz’s document is headed, “Flag Officer Submarines, Operations\r\nDivision,” and is marked “Most Secret.” The subject is “Base in Norway.”\r\nThen there are set out “suppositions”, “advantages and disadvantages”,\r\nand then “conclusions”. The last paragraph (III) reads:\r\n\r\n    “The following is therefore proposed:\r\n\r\n    “(1) Establishment of a base in Trondheim, including:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Possibility of supplying fuel, compressed air, oxygen,\r\n    provisions.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Repair opportunities for overhaul work after an encounter.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Good opportunities for accommodating U-boat crews.\r\n\r\n    “_d._ Flak protection, L.A. armament, petrol and M/S units.\r\n\r\n    “Secondly, establishment of the possibility of supplying fuel in\r\n    Narvik as an alternative.” (_C-5_)\r\n\r\nIn October 1939 Hitler was merely considering the Norwegian aggression\r\nand had not yet committed himself to it. Raeder persevered in pressing\r\nhis point of view with regard to Norway, and at this stage he found a\r\npowerful ally in Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nC. _Use of the Fifth Column: Quisling._\r\n\r\nThe Nazi employment of traitors and the stimulation of treachery as a\r\npolitical weapon are now proven historical facts. Should further proof\r\nbe required, it is found in a “Brief Report on Activities of the Foreign\r\nAffairs Bureau of the Party (_Aussenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP_) from\r\n1933 to 1943” (_007-PS_). This was Rosenberg’s Bureau. The report reads:\r\n\r\n    “When the Foreign Affairs Bureau (_Aussenpolitische Amt_) was\r\n    established on the 1st of April 1933, the Fuehrer directed that\r\n    it should not be expanded to a large bureaucratic agency, but\r\n    should rather develop its effectiveness through initiative and\r\n    suggestions.\r\n\r\n    “Corresponding to the extraordinarily hostile attitude adopted\r\n    by the Soviet Government in Moscow from the beginning, the\r\n    newly-established Bureau devoted particular attention to\r\n    internal conditions in the Soviet Union, as well as to the\r\n    effects of World Bolshevism primarily in other European\r\n    countries. It entered into contact with the most variegated\r\n    groups inclining towards National Socialism in combatting\r\n    Bolshevism, focussing its main attention on Nations and States\r\n    bordering on the Soviet Union. On the one hand, those Nations\r\n    and states constituted an _Insulating Ring_ encircling the\r\n    Bolshevist neighbor; on the other hand they were the laterals of\r\n    German living space and took up a flanking position towards the\r\n    Western Powers, especially Great Britain. In order to wield the\r\n    desired influence by one means or another, the Bureau was\r\n    compelled to use the most varying methods, taking into\r\n    consideration the completely different living conditions, the\r\n    ties of blood, intellect and history of the movements observed\r\n    by the Bureau in those countries.\r\n\r\n    “In Scandinavia an outspokenly pro-Anglo-Saxon attitude, based\r\n    on economic consideration, had become progressively more\r\n    dominant after the World War of 1914-18. There the Bureau put\r\n    the entire emphasis on influencing general cultural relations\r\n    with the Nordic peoples. For this purpose it took the Nordic\r\n    Society in Luebeck under its protection. The Reich conventions\r\n    of this society were attended by many outstanding personalities,\r\n    especially from Finland. While there were no openings for purely\r\n    political cooperation in Sweden and Denmark, an association\r\n    based on Greater Germanic ideology was found in Norway. Very\r\n    close relations were established with its founder, which led to\r\n    further consequences.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere follows an account of the activity of Rosenberg’s Bureau in\r\nvarious parts of the world. The last paragraph of the main body of the\r\nreport reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “With the outbreak of war, the Bureau was entitled to consider\r\n    its task as terminated. The exploitation of the many personal\r\n    connections in many lands can be resumed under a different\r\n    guise.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Annex to the report shows what the “exploitation of personal\r\nconnections” involved. Annex One to the document is headed, “To Brief\r\nReport on Activities of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Nazi Party\r\nfrom 1933 to 1943.” The subheading is “The Political Preparation of the\r\nMilitary Occupation of Norway During the War Years 1939-1940”. The annex\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “As previously mentioned, of all political groupings in\r\n    Scandinavia, only ‘_Nasjonal Samling_’ led in Norway by the\r\n    former Minister of War and Major of the Reserve, Vidkun\r\n    Quisling, deserved serious political attention. This was a\r\n    fighting political group, possessed by the idea of a Greater\r\n    Germanic Community. Naturally, all ruling powers were hostile\r\n    and attempted to prevent, by any means, its success among the\r\n    population. The Bureau maintained constant liaison with Quisling\r\n    and attentively observed the attacks he conducted with tenacious\r\n    energy on the middle class, which had been taken in tow by the\r\n    English.\r\n\r\n    “From the beginning, it appeared probable that without\r\n    revolutionary events, which would stir the population from their\r\n    former attitude, no successful progress of _Nasjonal Samling_\r\n    was to be expected. During the winter 1938-1939, Quisling was\r\n    privately visited by a member of the Bureau.\r\n\r\n    “When the political situation in Europe came to a head in 1939,\r\n    Quisling made an appearance at the convention of the Nordic\r\n    Society in Luebeck in June. He expounded his conception of the\r\n    situation, and his apprehensions concerning Norway. He\r\n    emphatically drew attention to the geopolitically decisive\r\n    importance of Norway in the Scandinavian area, and to the\r\n    advantages that would accrue to the power dominating the\r\n    Norwegian coast in case of a conflict between the Greater German\r\n    Reich and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    “Assuming that his statement would be of special interest to the\r\n    Marshal of the Reich Goering for aero-strategical reasons,\r\n    Quisling was referred to State Secretary Koerner by the Bureau.\r\n    The Staff Director of the Bureau handed the Chief of the Reich\r\n    Chancellery a memorandum for transmission to the Fuehrer.”\r\n    (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis document is another illustration of the close interweaving between\r\nthe political and military leadership of the Nazi State. Raeder, in his\r\nreport to Admiral Assmann, admitted his collaboration with Rosenberg\r\n(_C-66_). The second paragraph of the Raeder report, headed\r\n“_Weseruebung_,” reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In the further developments, I was supported by Commander\r\n    Schreiber, Naval Attache in Oslo and the M-Chief personally—in\r\n    conjunction with the Rosenberg Organization. Thus, we got in\r\n    touch with Quisling and Hagelin, who came to Berlin at the\r\n    beginning of December and were taken to the Fuehrer by me—with\r\n    the approval of Reichsleiter Rosenberg.” (_C-66_)\r\n\r\nThe details of the manner in which Raeder made contact personally with\r\nQuisling are not clear. In a report from Rosenberg to Raeder, however,\r\nthe full extent of Quisling’s preparedness for treachery and his\r\npotential usefulness to the Nazi aggressors was reported and disclosed\r\nto Raeder. The second paragraph of this report reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The reasons for a coup, on which Quisling made a report, would\r\n    be provided by the fact that the Storthing (the Norwegian\r\n    Parliament) had, in defense of the constitution, passed a\r\n    resolution prolonging its own life which is to become operative\r\n    on January 12th. Quisling still retains in his capacity as a\r\n    long-standing officer and a former Minister of War, the closest\r\n    relations with the Norwegian Army. He showed me the original of\r\n    a letter which he had received only a short time previously from\r\n    the Commanding Officer in Narvik, Colonel Sunlo. In this letter,\r\n    Colonel Sunlo frankly lays emphasis on the fact that, if things\r\n    went on as they were going at present, Norway was finished.”\r\n    (_C-65_)\r\n\r\nThen came the details of a plot to overthrow the government of Norway by\r\nthe traitor Quisling, in collaboration with Rosenberg:\r\n\r\n    “A plan has been put forward which deals with the possibility of\r\n    a coup, and which provides for a number of selected Norwegians\r\n    to be trained in Germany with all possible speed for such a\r\n    purpose, being allotted their exact tasks, and provided with\r\n    experienced and die-hard National Socialists, who are practiced\r\n    in such operations. These trained men should then proceed with\r\n    all speed to Norway, where details would then require to be\r\n    further discussed. Some important centers in Oslo would have to\r\n    be taken over immediately, and at the same time the German\r\n    Fleet, together with suitable contingents of the German Army,\r\n    would go into operation when summoned specially by the new\r\n    Norwegian Government in a specified bay at the approaches to\r\n    Oslo. Quisling has no doubts that such a coup, having been\r\n    carried out with instantaneous success—would immediately bring\r\n    him the approval of those sections of the Army with which he at\r\n    present has connections, and thus it goes without saying that he\r\n    has never discussed a political fight with them. As far as the\r\n    King is concerned, he believes that he would respect it as an\r\n    accomplished fact. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Quisling gives figures of the number of German troops required\r\n    which accord with German calculations.” (_C-65_)\r\n\r\nSubsequent developments are indicated in a report by Raeder of his\r\nmeeting with Hitler on 12 December 1939 at 1200 hours, in the presence\r\nof Keitel, Jodl and Puttkammer, who at this time was adjutant to Hitler.\r\nThe report is headed “Norwegian Question”, and the first sentence reads:\r\n\r\n    “C-in-C Navy” (Raeder) “has received Quisling and Hagelin.\r\n    Quisling creates the impression of being reliable.” (_C-64_)\r\n\r\nThere then follows, in the next, two paragraphs, a statement of\r\nQuisling’s views. The fourth paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer thought of speaking to Quisling personally so that\r\n    he might form an impression of him. He wanted to see Rosenberg\r\n    once more beforehand, as the latter has known Quisling for a\r\n    long while. C-in-C Navy” [Raeder] “suggests that if the Fuehrer\r\n    forms a favorable impression, the OKW should obtain permission\r\n    to make plans with Quisling for the preparation and carrying out\r\n    of the occupation.\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) By peaceful means; that is to say, German forces summoned\r\n    by Norway, or\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) To agree to do so by force.” (_C-64_)\r\n\r\nIt was at a meeting on 12 December that Raeder made the above report to\r\nHitler.\r\n\r\nRaeder’s record of these transactions reports the next event:\r\n\r\n    “Thus, we got in touch with Quisling and Hagelin, who came to\r\n    Berlin at the beginning of December and were taken to the\r\n    Fuehrer by me, with the approval of Reichsleiter Rosenberg.”\r\n    (_C-66_)\r\n\r\nA note at the bottom of the page states:\r\n\r\n    “At the crucial moment, R” (presumably Rosenberg) “hurt his\r\n    foot, so that I visited him in his house on the morning of the\r\n    14th of December.” (_C-66_)\r\n\r\nThat is Raeder’s note, and it indicates the extent of his contact in\r\nthis conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe report continues:\r\n\r\n    “On the grounds of the Fuehrer’s discussion with Quisling and\r\n    Hagelin on the afternoon of the 14th of December, the Fuehrer\r\n    gave the order that the preparations for the Norwegian operation\r\n    were to be made by the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n    “Until that moment, the Naval War Staff had taken no part in the\r\n    development of the Norwegian question, and continued to be\r\n    somewhat skeptical about it. The preparations, which were\r\n    undertaken by Captain Kranke in the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\n    Forces, were founded, however, on a memorandum of the Naval War\r\n    Staff.” (_C-66_)\r\n\r\nRaeder’s note referring to the “crucial” moment was an appropriate one,\r\nfor on the same day that it was written, 14 December, Hitler gave the\r\norder that preparations for the Norwegian operation were to be begun by\r\nthe Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s report on the activities of his organization deals with\r\nfurther meetings between Quisling and the Nazi chiefs in December. The\r\nextract reads:\r\n\r\n    “Quisling was granted a personal audience with the Fuehrer on 16\r\n    December, and once more on 18 December. In the course of this\r\n    audience the Fuehrer emphasized repeatedly that he personally\r\n    would prefer a completely neutral attitude of Norway, as well as\r\n    of the whole of Scandinavia. He did not intend to enlarge the\r\n    theatre of war and to draw still other nations into the\r\n    conflict. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “Should the enemy attempt to extend the war however, with the\r\n    aim of achieving further throttling and intimidation of the\r\n    Greater German Reich, he would be compelled to gird himself\r\n    against such an undertaking. In order to counterbalance\r\n    increasing enemy propaganda activity, he promised Quisling\r\n    financial support of his movement, which is based on Greater\r\n    German ideology. Military exploitation of the question now\r\n    raised was assigned to the special military staff, which\r\n    transmitted special missions to Quisling. Reichsleiter Rosenberg\r\n    was to take over political exploitation. Financial expenses were\r\n    to be defrayed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs [Ribbentrop’s\r\n    organization], the Minister for Foreign Affairs [Ribbentrop]\r\n    being kept continuously informed by the Foreign Affairs Bureau\r\n    [Rosenberg’s organization].\r\n\r\n    “Chief of Section Scheidt was charged with maintaining liaison\r\n    with Quisling. In the course of further developments he was\r\n    assigned to the Naval Attache in Oslo. Orders were given that\r\n    the whole matter be handled with strictest secrecy.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nHere again is a further indication of the close link between the Nazi\r\npoliticians and the Nazi service chiefs.\r\n\r\nD. _Operational Planning_\r\n\r\nThe information available on the events of January 1940 is not full, but\r\nit is clear that the agitation of Raeder and Rosenberg bore fruit. An\r\norder signed by Keitel, dated 27 January 1940, marked “Most Secret, five\r\ncopies; reference, Study ‘N’”, (an earlier code name for the\r\n_Weseruebung_ preparations) and classified \"Access only through an\r\nofficer,” stated:\r\n\r\n    “C-in-C of the Navy [Raeder] has a report on this * * *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces wishes\r\n    that Study ‘N’ should be further worked on under my direct and\r\n    personal guidance, and in the closest conjunction with the\r\n    general war policy. For these reasons the Fuehrer has\r\n    commissioned me to take over the direction of further\r\n    preparations.\r\n\r\n    “A working staff has been formed at the Supreme Command of the\r\n    Armed Forces Headquarters for this purpose, and this represents\r\n    at the same time the nucleus of a future operational staff.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “All further plans will be made under the cover name\r\n    ‘_Weseruebung_.’” (_C-63_)\r\n\r\nThe importance of that document, to the signature of Keitel upon it, and\r\nto the date of this important decision, is this: Prior to this date, 27\r\nJanuary 1940, the planning of the various aspects of the invasion of\r\nNorway and Denmark had been confined to a relatively small group, whose\r\naim had been to persuade Hitler of the desirability of undertaking the\r\noperation. The issuance of this directive of Keitel’s on 27 January\r\n1940, was the signal that the Supreme Command of the German Armed\r\nForces, the OKW, had accepted the proposition of the group that was\r\npressing for the Norwegian adventure, and had turned the combined\r\nresources of the German military machine to the task of producing\r\npractical and coordinated plans for the Norwegian operation. From\r\nJanuary onward the operational planning for the invasion of Norway and\r\nDenmark was started through the normal channels.\r\n\r\nCertain entries in the diary of Jodl reveal how the preparations\r\nprogressed (_1809-PS_). The entry for 6 February commences:\r\n\r\n    “New idea: Carry out ‘H’ [_Hartmundt_, another code word for the\r\n    Norwegian and Danish invasion] and Weser Exercise only and\r\n    guarantee Belgium’s neutrality for the duration of the war.”\r\n    (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 21 February reads:\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer has talked with General von Falkenhorst, and charges\r\n    him with preparation of ‘Weser Exercise.’ Falkenhorst accepts\r\n    gladly. Instructions issued to the three branches of the armed\r\n    forces.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 28 February reads:\r\n\r\n    “I propose, first to the Chief of OKW and then to the Fuehrer,\r\n    that Case Yellow [the code name for the invasion of the\r\n    Netherlands] and Weser Exercise [the invasion of Norway and\r\n    Denmark] must be prepared in such a way that they will be\r\n    independent of one another as regards both time and forces\r\n    employed. The Fuehrer completely agrees, if this is in any way\r\n    possible.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the new idea of 6 February, that the neutrality\r\nof Belgium might be preserved, had been abandoned by 28 February.\r\n\r\nThe entry for 29 February reads:\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer also wishes to have a strong task force in Copenhagen\r\n    and a plan, elaborated in detail, showing how individual coastal\r\n    batteries are to be captured by shock troops. Warlimont, _Chef\r\n    Landesverteidigung_, instructed to make out immediately the\r\n    order of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and Director of Armed\r\n    Forces to make out a similar order regarding the strengthening\r\n    of the staff.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThen came Hitler’s order to complete the preparations for the invasion\r\nof Norway and Denmark (_C-174_). It bears the date of 1 March 1940, and\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Most\r\n    Secret.\r\n\r\n    “Directive for _Fall Weseruebung_.\r\n\r\n    “The development of the situation in Scandinavia requires the\r\n    making of all preparations for the occupation of Denmark and\r\n    Norway by a part of the German Armed Forces—_Fall Weseruebung_.\r\n    This operation should prevent British encroachment on\r\n    Scandinavia and the Baltic; further, it should guarantee our ore\r\n    base in Sweden and give our Navy and Air Force a wider start\r\n    line against Britain.\r\n\r\n    “In view of our military and political power in comparison with\r\n    that of the Scandinavian States, the force to be employed in the\r\n    _Fall Weseruebung_ will be kept as small as possible. The\r\n    numerical weakness will be balanced by daring actions and\r\n    surprise execution. On principle we will do our utmost to make\r\n    the operation appear as a peaceful occupation, the object of\r\n    which is the military protection of the neutrality of the\r\n    Scandinavian States. Corresponding demands will be transmitted\r\n    to the Governments at the beginning of the occupation. If\r\n    necessary, demonstrations by the Navy and the Air Force will\r\n    provide the necessary emphasis. If, in spite of this, resistance\r\n    should be met with, all military means will be used to crush\r\n    it.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I put in charge of the preparations and the conduct of the\r\n    operation against Denmark and Norway the Commanding General of\r\n    the 21st Army Corps, General von Falkenhorst. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “The crossing of the Danish border and the landings in Norway\r\n    must take place simultaneously. I emphasize that the operations\r\n    must be prepared as quickly as possible. In case the enemy\r\n    seizes the initiative against Norway, we must be able to apply\r\n    immediately our own counter-measures.\r\n\r\n    “It is most important that the Scandinavian States as well as\r\n    the Western opponents should be taken by surprise by our\r\n    measures. All preparations, particularly those of transport and\r\n    of readiness, drafting and embarkation of the troops, must be\r\n    made with this factor in mind.\r\n\r\n    “In case the preparations for embarkation can no longer be kept\r\n    secret, the leaders and the troops will be deceived with\r\n    fictitious objectives.” (_C-174_)\r\n\r\nThe section on “The Occupation of Denmark” which is given the code name\r\nof “_Weseruebung Sued_”, provides:\r\n\r\n    “The task of Group XXI: Occupation by surprise of Jutland and of\r\n    Fuenen immediately after occupation of Seeland.\r\n\r\n    “Added to this, having secured the most important places, the\r\n    Group will break through as quickly as possible from Fuenen to\r\n    Skagen and to the east coast.” (_C-174_)\r\n\r\nThere then follow other instructions with regard to the operation.\r\n\r\nThe section on “The Occupation of Norway”, given the code name of\r\n“_Weseruebung Nord_”, provides:\r\n\r\n    “The task of the Group XXI: Capture by surprise of the most\r\n    important places on the coast by sea and airborne operations.\r\n\r\n    “The Navy will take over the preparation and carrying out of the\r\n    transport by sea of the landing troops. * * * The Air Force,\r\n    after the occupation has been completed, will ensure air defense\r\n    and will make use of Norwegian bases for air warfare against\r\n    Britain.” (_C-174_)\r\n\r\nWhilst these preparations were being made, and just prior to the final\r\ndecision of Hitler, reports were coming in through Rosenberg’s\r\norganization from Quisling. The third paragraph in Annex I, the section\r\ndealing with Norway, has this information:\r\n\r\n    “Quisling’s reports, transmitted to his representative in\r\n    Germany, Hagelin, and dealing with the possibility of\r\n    intervention by the Western Powers in Norway with tacit consent\r\n    of the Norwegian Government, became more urgent by January.\r\n    These increasingly better substantiated communications were in\r\n    sharpest contrast to the views of the German Legation in Oslo,\r\n    which relied on the desire for neutrality of the then Norwegian\r\n    Nygardszvold Cabinet, and was convinced of that government’s\r\n    intention and readiness to defend Norway’s neutrality. No one in\r\n    Norway knew that Quisling’s representative for Germany\r\n    maintained closest relations to him; he therefore succeeded in\r\n    gaining a foothold within governmental circles of the\r\n    Nygardszvold cabinet and in listening to the cabinet members’\r\n    views. Hagelin transmitted what he had heard to the Bureau\r\n    [Rosenberg’s bureau], which conveyed the news to the Fuehrer\r\n    through Reichsleiter Rosenberg. During the night of the 16th to\r\n    17th of February, English destroyers attacked the German steamer\r\n    ‘Altmark’ in Jessingjord.* * *” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\n(That is a reference to the action by the British destroyer _Cossack_\r\nagainst the German naval auxiliary vessel _Altmark_, which was carrying\r\nthree hundred British prisoners, captured on the high seas, to Germany\r\nthrough Norwegian territorial waters. The position of the British\r\ndelegation with regard to that episode is that the use that was being\r\nmade by the _Altmark_ of Norwegian territorial waters was in fact a\r\nflagrant abuse in itself of Norwegian neutrality, and that the action\r\ntaken by H.M.S. _Cossack_, which was restricted to rescuing the three\r\nhundred British prisoners on board, no attempt being made to destroy the\r\n_Altmark_ or to capture the armed guards on board her, was fully\r\njustified under international law.)\r\n\r\nThe Rosenberg report continues:\r\n\r\n    “The Norwegian Government’s reaction to this question permitted\r\n    the conclusion that certain agreements had been covertly arrived\r\n    at between the Norwegian Government and the Allies. Such\r\n    assumption was confirmed by reports of Section Scheidt, who in\r\n    turn derived his information from Hagelin and Quisling. But even\r\n    after this incident the German Legation in Oslo championed the\r\n    opposite view, and went on record as believing in the good\r\n    intentions of the Norwegians.” (_007-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd so the Nazi Government preferred the reports of the traitor Quisling\r\nto the considered judgment of German diplomatic representatives in\r\nNorway. The result of the receipt of reports of that kind was the Hitler\r\ndecision to invade Norway and Denmark. The culminating details in the\r\npreparations for the invasion are again found in Jodl’s diary. The entry\r\nfor 3 March relates:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer expressed himself very sharply on the necessity of\r\n    a swift entry into N [Norway] with strong forces.\r\n\r\n    “No delay by any branch of the armed forces. Very rapid\r\n    acceleration of the attack necessary.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe last entry for 3 March reads:\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer decides to carry out ‘Weser Exercise’ before case\r\n    ‘Yellow’ with a few days interval.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, the important issue of strategy which had been concerning the\r\nGerman High Command for some time had been decided by this date, and the\r\nfate of Scandinavia was to be sealed before the fate of the Low Country.\r\nIt will be observed from those entries of 3 March that by that date\r\nHitler had become an enthusiastic convert to the idea of aggression\r\nagainst Norway.\r\n\r\nThe entry in Jodl’s diary for 5 March reads:\r\n\r\n    “Big conference with the three commanders-in-chief about ‘Weser\r\n    Exercise.’ Field Marshal in a rage because not consulted till\r\n    now. Won’t listen to anyone and wants to show that all\r\n    preparations so far made are worthless.\r\n\r\n    “Result: (_a_) Stronger forces to Narvik.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Navy to leave ships in the ports (Hipper or Luetzow in\r\n    Trondheim).\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) Christiansand can be left out at first.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) Six divisions envisaged for Norway.\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) A foothold to be gained immediately in Copenhagen.”\r\n    (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 13 March is one of the most remarkable in the\r\ndocumentation of this case.\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer does not give order yet for ‘W’ [Weser Exercise]. He is\r\n    still looking for an excuse.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry of the next day, 14 March, shows a similar preoccupation on\r\nthe part of Hitler with the search for an excuse for this aggression. It\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “English keep vigil in the North Sea with fifteen to sixteen\r\n    submarines; doubtful whether reason to safeguard own operations\r\n    or prevent operations by Germans. Fuehrer has not yet decided\r\n    what reason to give for ‘Weser Exercise.’” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 21 March reads:\r\n\r\n    “Misgivings of Task Force 21 [Falkenhorst’s Force, detailed to\r\n    conduct the invasion] about the long interval between taking up\r\n    readiness positions at 05.30 hours and close of diplomatic\r\n    negotiations. Fuehrer rejects any earlier negotiations, as\r\n    otherwise calls for help go out to England and America. If\r\n    resistance is put up it must be ruthlessly broken. The political\r\n    plenipotentiaries must emphasize the military measures taken,\r\n    and even exaggerate them.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry of 28 March reads:\r\n\r\n    “Individual naval officers seem to be lukewarm concerning the\r\n    Weser Exercise and need a stimulus. Also Falkenhorst and the\r\n    other two commanders are worrying about matters which are none\r\n    of their business. Franke sees more disadvantages than\r\n    advantages.\r\n\r\n    “In the evening the Fuehrer visits the map room and roundly\r\n    declares that he won’t stand for the Navy clearing out of the\r\n    Norwegian ports right away. Narvik, Trondheim and Oslo will have\r\n    to remain occupied by naval forces.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 2 April reads:\r\n\r\n    “Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Commander-in-Chief of the\r\n    Navy, and General von Falkenhorst with the Fuehrer. All confirm\r\n    preparations completed. Fuehrer orders carrying out of the Weser\r\n    Exercise for April 9th.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 4 April reads:\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer drafts the proclamation. Piepenbrock, Chief of Military\r\n    Intelligence 1, returns with good results from the talks with\r\n    Quisling in Copenhagen.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrom the large number of operation orders that were issued in connection\r\nwith the aggression against Norway and Denmark, two may be cited to\r\nillustrate the extent of the secrecy and deception that was used by the\r\nconspirators in the course of that aggression. The first dated 4 April\r\n1940, reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The barrage-breaking vessels (_Sperrbrechers_) will\r\n    penetrate inconspicuously, and with lights on, into Oslo Fjord,\r\n    disguised as merchant steamers.\r\n\r\n    “Challenge from coastal signal stations and lookouts are to be\r\n    answered by the deceptive use of the names of English steamers.\r\n    I lay particular stress on the importance of not giving away the\r\n    operation before zero hour.” (_C-115_)\r\n\r\nAn order for reconnaissance forces, dated 24 March 1940, entitled\r\n“Behavior during entrance into the harbor,” reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “The disguise as British craft must be kept up as long as\r\n    possible. All challenges in Morse by Norwegian ships will be\r\n    answered in English. In answer to questions a text with\r\n    something like the following content will be chosen:\r\n\r\n    “Calling at Bergen for a short visit; no hostile intent.\r\n\r\n    “Challenges to be answered with names of British warships:\r\n\r\n “Koeln                                                     H.M.S.

Continual readiness for making smoke.” (_C-115_)\r\n\r\nAn order dated 24 March 1940, classified “Most Secret,” provides:\r\n\r\n    “Following is laid down as guiding principle should one of our\r\n    own units find itself compelled to answer the challenge of\r\n    passing craft. To challenge in case of the ‘Koeln’ H.M.S. Cairo.\r\n    Then to order to stop: (1) Please repeat last signal. (2)\r\n    Impossible to understand your signal. In case of a warning shot:\r\n    Stop firing. British ship. Good friend. In case of an inquiry as\r\n    to destination and purpose: Going Bergen. Chasing German\r\n    steamers.” (_C-115_)\r\n\r\nDoenitz’s order in connection with this operation is headed “Top Secret,\r\nOperation Order ‘_Hartmut_.’”\r\n\r\n    “Occupation of Denmark and Norway. This order comes into force\r\n    on the codeword ‘_Hartmut_.’ With its coming into force the\r\n    orders hitherto valid for the boats taking part lose their\r\n    validity.\r\n\r\n    “The day and hour are designated as ‘Weser-Day’ and\r\n    ‘Weser-Hour’, and the whole operation is known as\r\n    ‘_Weseruebung_’.\r\n\r\n    “The operation ordered by the codeword has its objective the\r\n    rapid surprise landing of troops in Norway. Simultaneously\r\n    Denmark will be occupied from the Baltic and from the land side.\r\n    * * * The naval force will as they enter the harbor fly the\r\n    British flag until the troops have landed, except presumably at\r\n    Narvik.” (_C-151_)\r\n\r\nE. _Nazi Justification of Invasion._\r\n\r\nOn 9 April 1940 the Nazi onslaught on the unsuspecting and almost\r\nunarmed people of Norway and Denmark was launched. When the invasions\r\nhad already begun, a German memorandum was handed to the governments of\r\nNorway and Denmark attempting to justify the German action (_TC-55_).\r\nThat memorandum alleges that England and France were guilty in their\r\nmaritime warfare of breaches of international law; that Britain and\r\nFrance are making plans themselves to invade and occupy Norway; and that\r\nthe government of Norway was prepared to acquiesce in such a situation.\r\nThe memorandum further states:\r\n\r\n    “The German troops therefore do not set foot on Norwegian soil\r\n    as enemies. The German High Command does not intend to make use\r\n    of the points occupied by German troops as bases for operations\r\n    against England, so long as it is not forced to do so by\r\n    measures taken by England and France. German military operations\r\n    aim much more exclusively at protecting the north against\r\n    proposed occupation of Norwegian strong points by English-French\r\n    forces.” (_TC-55_)\r\n\r\nIn connection with that statement it may be recalled that in his\r\noperation order on 1 March Hitler had given orders to the Air Force to\r\nmake use of Norwegian bases for air warfare against Britain. That was on\r\n1 March. And this is the memorandum which was produced as an excuse on 9\r\nApril. The last two paragraphs of the German memorandum to Norway and\r\nDenmark are a classic Nazi combination of diplomatic hypocrisy and\r\nmilitary threat:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Government thus expects that the Royal Norwegian\r\n    Government and the Norwegian people will respond with\r\n    understanding to the German measures and offer no resistance to\r\n    it. Any resistance would have to be and would be broken by all\r\n    possible means by the German forces employed, and would\r\n    therefore lead only to absolutely useless bloodshed. The Royal\r\n    Norwegian Government is therefore requested to take all measures\r\n    with the greatest speed to ensure that the advance of the German\r\n    troops can take place without friction and difficulty. In the\r\n    spirit of the good German-Norwegian relations that have always\r\n    existed, the Reich Government declares to the Royal Norwegian\r\n    Government that Germany has no intention of infringing by her\r\n    measures the territorial integrity and political independence of\r\n    the Kingdom of Norway now or in the future.” (_TC-55_)\r\n\r\nWhat the Nazis meant by “protection of the kingdom of Norway” was shown\r\nby their conduct on 9 April.\r\n\r\nA report by the Commander in Chief of the Royal Norwegian Forces states:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Germans, considering the long lines of communications\r\n    and the threat of the British Navy, clearly understood the\r\n    necessity of complete surprise and speed in the attack. In order\r\n    to paralyze the will of the Norwegian people to defend their\r\n    country and at the same time to prevent allied intervention it\r\n    was planned to capture all the more important towns along the\r\n    coast simultaneously. Members of the Government and Parliament\r\n    and other military and civilian people occupying important\r\n    positions were to be arrested before organized resistance could\r\n    be put into effect and the King was to be forced to form a new\r\n    government with Quisling as the head.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The German attack came as a surprise and all the invaded towns\r\n    along the coast were captured according to plan with only slight\r\n    losses. In the Oslofjord, however, the cruiser ‘Blucher’,\r\n    carrying General Engelbrecht and parts of his division,\r\n    technical staffs and specialists who were to take over the\r\n    control of Oslo, was sunk. The plan to capture the King and\r\n    members of the Government and Parliament failed in spite of the\r\n    surprise of the attack; resistance was organized throughout the\r\n    country.” (_TC-56_)\r\n\r\nWhat happened in Denmark is described in a memorandum prepared by the\r\nRoyal Danish Government (_D-628_). An extract from it reads:\r\n\r\n    “Extracts from the Memorandum concerning Germany’s attitude\r\n    towards Denmark before and during the occupation, prepared by\r\n    the Royal Danish Government.\r\n\r\n    “On the 9th of April, 1940 at 4.20 hours the German Minister\r\n    appeared at the private residence of the Danish Minister for\r\n    Foreign Affairs accompanied by the Air Attache of the Legation.\r\n    The appointment had been made by a telephone call from the\r\n    German Legation to the Secretary-General of the Ministry for\r\n    Foreign Affairs at 4.00 o’clock the same morning. The Minister\r\n    said at once that Germany had positive proof that Great Britain\r\n    intended to occupy bases in Denmark and Norway. Germany had to\r\n    safeguard Denmark against this. For this reason German soldiers\r\n    were now crossing the frontier and landing at various points in\r\n    Zealand including the port of Copenhagen; in a short time German\r\n    bombers would be over Copenhagen; their orders were not to bomb\r\n    until further notice. It was now up to the Danes to prevent\r\n    resistance as any resistance would have the most terrible\r\n    consequences. Germany would guarantee Denmark’s territorial\r\n    integrity and political independence. Germany would not\r\n    interfere with the internal government of Denmark, but wanted\r\n    only to make sure of the neutrality of the country. For this\r\n    purpose the presence of the German Wehrmacht in Denmark was\r\n    required during the war.\r\n\r\n    “The Minister for Foreign Affairs declared in reply that the\r\n    allegation concerning British plans to occupy Denmark was\r\n    completely without foundation; there was no possibility of\r\n    anything like that. The Minister for Foreign Affairs protested\r\n    against the violation of Denmark’s neutrality which according to\r\n    the German Minister’s statement was in progress. The Minister\r\n    for Foreign Affairs declared further that he could not give a\r\n    reply to the demands, which had to be submitted to the King and\r\n    the Prime Minister, and further observed that the German\r\n    Minister knew, as everybody else, that the Danish armed forces\r\n    had orders to oppose violations of Denmark’s neutrality so that\r\n    fighting presumably already took place. In reply the German\r\n    Minister expressed that the matter was very urgent, not least to\r\n    avoid air bombardment.” (_D-628_)\r\n\r\nWhat happened thereafter is described in a dispatch from the British\r\nMinister in Copenhagen to the British Foreign Secretary (_D-627_). That\r\ndispatch reads:\r\n\r\n    “The actual events of the 9th April have been pieced together by\r\n    members of my staff from actual eye-witnesses or from reliable\r\n    information subsequently received and are given below. Early in\r\n    the morning towards 5 o’clock three small German transports\r\n    steamed into the approach to Copenhagen harbor, whilst a number\r\n    of airplanes circled overhead. The northern battery, guarding\r\n    the harbor approach, fired a warning shot at these planes when\r\n    it was seen that they carried German markings. Apart from this,\r\n    the Danes offered no further resistance, and the German vessels\r\n    fastened alongside the quays in the Free Harbor. Some of these\r\n    airplanes proceeded to drop leaflets over the town urging the\r\n    population to keep calm and cooperate with the Germans. I\r\n    enclose a specimen of this leaflet, which is written in a\r\n    bastard Norwegian-Danish, a curiously un-German disregard of\r\n    detail, together with a translation. Approximately 800 soldiers\r\n    landed with full equipment, and marched to Kastellet, the old\r\n    fortress of Copenhagen and now a barracks. The door was locked,\r\n    so the Germans promptly burst it open with explosives and\r\n    rounded up all the Danish soldiers within, together with the\r\n    womenfolk employed in the mess. The garrison offered no\r\n    resistance, and it appears that they were taken completely by\r\n    surprise. One officer tried to escape in a motor car, but his\r\n    chauffeur was shot before they could get away. He died in\r\n    hospital two days later. After seizing the barracks, a\r\n    detachment was sent to Amalienborg, the King’s palace, where\r\n    they engaged the Danish sentries on guard, wounding three, one\r\n    of them fatally. Meanwhile, a large fleet of bombers flew over\r\n    the city at low altitudes.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It has been difficult to ascertain exactly what occurred in\r\n    Jutland. It is clear, however, that the enemy invaded Jutland\r\n    from the south at dawn on the 9th April and were at first\r\n    resisted by the Danish forces, who suffered casualties. The\r\n    chances of resistance were weakened by the extent to which the\r\n    forces appear to have been taken by surprise. The chief\r\n    permanent official of the Ministry of War, for instance, motored\r\n    into Copenhagen on the morning of the 9th April and drove\r\n    blithely past a sentry who challenged him, in blissful ignorance\r\n    that this was not one of his own men. It took a bullet, which\r\n    passed through the lapels of his coat, to disillusion him.”\r\n    (_D-627_)\r\n\r\nThe German memorandum to the Norwegian and Danish governments spoke of\r\nthe German desire to maintain the territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of those two small countries. Two documents indicate the\r\nkind of territorial integrity and political independence the Nazi\r\nconspirators contemplated for the victims of their aggression. An entry\r\nin Jodl’s diary for 19 April reads:\r\n\r\n    “Renewed crisis. Envoy Braver is recalled: since Norway is at\r\n    war with us, the task of the Foreign Office is finished. In the\r\n    Fuehrer’s opinion, force has to be used. It is said that\r\n    Gauleiter Terboven will be given a post. Field Marshal\r\n    [presumably a reference to Goering] is moving in the same\r\n    direction. He criticizes as defects that we didn’t take\r\n    sufficiently energetic measures against the civilian population,\r\n    that we could have seized electrical plant, that the Navy didn’t\r\n    supply enough troops. The Air Force can’t do everything.”\r\n    (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from that entry and the reference to Gauleiter Terboven\r\nthat already by 19 April, rule by Gauleiters had replaced rule by\r\nNorwegians.\r\n\r\nA memorandum dated 3 June 1940, signed by Fricke, at that date the head\r\nof the Operations Division of the German Naval War Staff, which was a\r\nkey appointment in the very nerve center of German naval operations,\r\nrelates to questions of territorial expansion and bases (_C-41_). It\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “These problems are preeminently of a political character and\r\n    comprise an abundance of questions of a political type, which it\r\n    is not the Navy’s province to answer, but they also materially\r\n    affect the strategic possibilities open—according to the way in\r\n    which this question is answered—for the subsequent use and\r\n    operation of the Navy.\r\n\r\n    “It is too well known to need further mention that Germany’s\r\n    present position in the narrows of the Heligoland Bight and in\r\n    the Baltic—bordered as it is by a whole series of States and\r\n    under their influence—is an impossible one for the future of\r\n    Greater Germany. If, over and above this, one extends these\r\n    strategic possibilities to the point that Germany shall not\r\n    continue to be cut off for all time from overseas by natural\r\n    geographical facts, the demand is raised that somehow or other\r\n    an end shall be put to this state of affairs at the end of the\r\n    war.\r\n\r\n    “The solution could perhaps be found among the following\r\n    possibilities.\r\n\r\n    “1. The territories of Denmark, Norway and Northern France\r\n    acquired during the course of the war continue to be so occupied\r\n    and organized that they can in future be considered as German\r\n    possessions.\r\n\r\n    “This solution will recommend itself for areas where the\r\n    severity of the decision tells, and should tell, on the enemy\r\n    and where a gradual ‘Germanizing’ of the territory appears\r\n    practicable.\r\n\r\n    “2. The taking over and holding of areas which have no direct\r\n    connection with Germany’s main body, and which, like the Russian\r\n    solution in Hango, remain permanently as an enclave in the\r\n    hostile State. Such areas might be considered possibly around\r\n    Brest and Trondjem.\r\n\r\n    “3. The power of Greater Germany in the strategic areas acquired\r\n    in this war should result in the existing population of these\r\n    areas feeling themselves politically, economically and\r\n    militarily to be completely dependent on Germany. If the\r\n    following results are achieved—that expansion is undertaken (on\r\n    a scale I shall describe later) by means of the military\r\n    measures for occupation taken during the war, that French powers\r\n    of resistance (popular unity, mineral resources, industry, Armed\r\n    Forces) are so broken that a revival must be considered out of\r\n    the question, that the smaller States such as the Netherlands,\r\n    Denmark and Norway are forced into a dependence on us which will\r\n    enable us in any circumstances and at any time easily to occupy\r\n    these countries again, then in practice the same, but\r\n    psychologically much more, will be achieved.” (_C-41_)\r\n\r\nThen Fricke recommends:\r\n\r\n    “The solution given in 3, therefore, appears to be the proper\r\n    one, that is, to crush France, to occupy Belgium, part of North\r\n    and East France, to allow the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway to\r\n    exist on the basis indicated above.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Time will show how far the outcome of the war with England will\r\n    make an extension of these demands possible.” (_C-41_)\r\n\r\nThe submission of the prosecution is that that and other documents which\r\nhave been submitted tear apart the veil of Nazi pretense. These\r\ndocuments reveal the menace behind the good-will of Goering; they expose\r\nas fraudulent the diplomacy of Ribbentrop; they show the reality behind\r\nthe ostensible political ideology of tradesmen in treason like\r\nRosenberg; and finally and above all, they render sordid the\r\nprofessional status of Keitel and of Raeder.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO AGGRESSION AGAINST\r\n                           NORWAY AND DENMARK\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F)  │      │\r\n                │  5; V.                                 │  I   │  27, 29\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

AGGRESSION AGAINST BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS,\r\n                             AND LUXEMBOURG\r\n\r\nThe independence of Belgium, which for so many centuries was the cockpit\r\nof Europe, was guaranteed by the great European powers in 1839. That\r\nguarantee was observed for 75 years, until it was broken by the Germans\r\nin 1914, who brought all the horrors of war, and the even greater\r\nhorrors of German occupation, to Belgium. History was to repeat itself\r\nin a still more catastrophic fashion some 25 years after, in 1940.\r\n\r\nAmong the applicable treaties are the Hague Convention of 1907 (_TC-3_;\r\n_TC-4_), the Locarno Arbitration and Conciliation Convention of 1925, in\r\nwhich Belgium’s independence and neutrality were guaranteed by Germany;\r\nthe Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, by which all the Powers renounced\r\nrecourse to war; and the Hague Convention of Arbitration and\r\nConciliation May 1926 between Germany and the Netherlands (_TC-16_).\r\nArticle I of the latter treaty provides:\r\n\r\n    “The contracting parties” (the Netherlands and the German Reich)\r\n    “undertake to submit all disputes of any nature whatever which\r\n    may arise between them which it has not been possible to settle\r\n    by diplomacy, and which have not been referred to the Permanent\r\n    Court of International Justice, to be dealt with by arbitration\r\n    or conciliation as provided.” (_TC-16_)\r\n\r\nSubsequent clauses deal with the machinery of conciliation. The last\r\narticle, Article 21, provides that the Convention shall be valid for ten\r\nyears, and then shall remain in force for successive periods of five\r\nyears until denounced by either party. And this treaty never was\r\ndenounced by Germany at all.\r\n\r\nThe last of the applicable treaties, all of which belong to the days of\r\nthe Weimar Republic, is the Treaty of Arbitration and Conciliation\r\nbetween Germany and Luxembourg, executed at Geneva in 1929 (_TC-20_).\r\nThe first few words of Article 1 are familiar:\r\n\r\n    “The contracting parties undertake to settle by peaceful means\r\n    all disputes of any nature whatever which may arise between them\r\n    and which it may not be possible to settle by\r\n\r\nThen follow clauses dealing with the machinery for peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes, which are in the common form.\r\n\r\nThose were the treaty obligations between Germany and Belgium at the\r\ntime when the Nazi Party came into power in 1933. Hitler adopted and\r\nratified the obligations of Germany under the Weimar Republic with\r\nregard to the treaties which had been entered into. Nothing more\r\noccurred to alter the position of Belgium until March 1936. Germany\r\nreoccupied the Rhineland and announced the resumption of conscription.\r\nAnd Hitler, on 7 March 1936 purported in a speech to repudiate the\r\nobligations of the German Government under the Locarno Pact, the reason\r\nbeing given as the execution of the Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935. There\r\nwas no legal foundation for this claim that Germany was entitled to\r\nrenounce obligations under the Locarno Pact. But Belgium was left in the\r\nair, in the sense that it had itself entered into various obligations\r\nunder the Locarno Pact in return for the liabilities which other nations\r\nacknowledged, and now one of those liabilities, namely, the liability of\r\nGermany to observe the Pact, had been renounced.\r\n\r\nAnd so on 30 January 1937, perhaps because Hitler realized the position\r\nof Belgium and of the Netherlands, Hitler gave solemn assurance—he used\r\nthe word “solemn”—which amounted to a full guarantee (_TC-33_). In\r\nApril 1937, France and England released Belgium from her obligations\r\nunder the Locarno Pact. Belgium gave guarantees of strict independence\r\nand neutrality, and France and England gave guarantees of assistance\r\nshould Belgium be attacked. It was because of those facts that Germany,\r\non 13 October 1937, gave a clear and unconditional guarantee to Belgium:\r\n\r\n    “I have the honor on behalf of the German Government to make the\r\n    following communication to Your Excellency: The German\r\n    Government has taken cognizance with particular interest of the\r\n    public declaration in which the Belgium Government defines the\r\n    international position of Belgium. For its part, it has\r\n    repeatedly given expressions, especially through the declaration\r\n    of the Chancellor of the German Reich in his speech of January\r\n    30th, 1937, to its own point of view. The German Government has\r\n    also taken cognizance of the declaration made by the British and\r\n    French Governments on the 24th of April 1937 * * *\r\n\r\n    “Since the conclusion of a treaty to replace the Treaty of\r\n    Locarno may still take some time, and being desirous of\r\n    strengthening the peaceful aspirations of the two countries, the\r\n    German Government regards it as appropriate to define now its\r\n    own attitude towards Belgium. To this end, it makes the\r\n    following declaration: First, the German Government has taken\r\n    note of the views which the Belgian Government has thought fit\r\n    to express. That is to say, (_a_) of the policy of independence\r\n    which it intends to exercise in full sovereignty; (_b_) of its\r\n    determination to defend the frontiers of Belgium with all its\r\n    forces against any aggression or invasion and to prevent Belgian\r\n    territory from being used for purposes of aggression against\r\n    another state as a passage or as a base of operation by land, by\r\n    sea, or in the air, and to organize the defense of Belgium in an\r\n    efficient manner to this purpose. Two: The German Government\r\n    considers that the inviolability and integrity of Belgium are\r\n    common interests of the Western Powers. It confirms its\r\n    determination that in no circumstances will it impair this\r\n    inviolability and integrity and that it will at all times\r\n    respect Belgian territory except, of course, in the event of\r\n    Belgium’s taking part in a military action directed against\r\n    Germany in an armed conflict in which Germany is involved. The\r\n    German Government, like the British and French Governments, is\r\n    prepared to assist Belgium should she be subjected to an attack\r\n    or to invasion. * * *” (_TC-34_)\r\n\r\nThe following reply was made:\r\n\r\n    “The Belgian Government has taken note with great satisfaction\r\n    of the declaration communicated to it this day by the German\r\n    Government. It thanks the German Government warmly for this\r\n    communication.” (_TC-34_)\r\n\r\nThus, in October 1937, Germany gave a solemn guarantee to this small\r\nnation of its peaceful aspiration towards her, and its assertion that\r\nthe integrity of the Belgian frontier was a common interest between her\r\nand Belgium and the other Western Powers. Yet eighteen months afterwards\r\nGermany had violated that assurance.\r\n\r\nThat this declaration of October 1937 meant very little to the leaders\r\nand to the high command of Germany can be seen from a document which\r\ncame into existence on 24 August 1938, at the time when the\r\nCzechoslovakia drama was unfolding, and when it was uncertain whether\r\nthere would be war with the Western Powers. This Top Secret document is\r\naddressed to the General Staff of the 5th Section of the German Air\r\nForce, and deals with the subject, “Extended Case Green—Appreciation of\r\nthe Situation with Special Consideration of the Enemy.” Apparently some\r\nstaff officer had been asked to prepare this appreciation. The last\r\nparagraph (No. H) reads:\r\n\r\n    “Requests to Armed Forces Supreme Command, Army and Navy. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Belgium and the Netherlands would, in German hands, represent\r\n    an extraordinary advantage in the prosecution of the air war\r\n    against Great Britain as well as against France. Therefore it is\r\n    held to be essential to obtain the opinion of the Army as to the\r\n    conditions under which an occupation of this area could be\r\n    carried out and how long it would take, and in this case it\r\n    would be necessary to reassess the commitment against Great\r\n    Britain.” (_375-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was apparently assumed by the staff officer who prepared this\r\ndocument, and assumed quite rightly, that the leaders of the German\r\nnation and the High Command would not pay the smallest attention to the\r\nfact that Germany had given her word not to invade Holland or Belgium.\r\nIt was recommended as a militarily advantageous thing to do, with the\r\nknowledge that, if the commanders and the Fuehrer agreed with that view,\r\ntreaties would be completely ignored. Such was the honor of the German\r\nGovernment and of its leaders.\r\n\r\nIn March of 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia had been peacefully\r\nannexed, and the time had come for further guarantees. Assurances which\r\nwere accordingly given to Belgium and the Netherlands on the 28th of\r\nApril 1939 (_TC-30_). A guarantee was also made to Luxembourg in a\r\nspeech by Hitler in the Reichstag, in which he dealt with a\r\ncommunication from Mr. Roosevelt, who was feeling a little uneasy as to\r\nHitler’s intentions (_TC-42-A_). In “The Nazi Plan,” a motion picture\r\nshown to the Tribunal by the American prosecution (_3054-PS_), the\r\ndelivery by Hitler of this part of this speech was shown. Hitler\r\nappeared in one of his jocular moods, as his words were greeted and\r\ndelivered in a jocular vein. The film shows that Goering, who sits above\r\nHitler in the Reichstag, appreciated very much the joke, the joke being\r\nthis: That it is an absurd suggestion to make that Germany could\r\npossibly go to war with any of its neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn this speech Hitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “Finally Mr. Roosevelt demands the readiness to give him an\r\n    assurance that the German fighting forces will not attack the\r\n    territory or possessions of the following independent nations,\r\n    and above all, that they will not march into them. And he goes\r\n    on to name the following as the countries in question: Finland,\r\n    Latvia, Lithuania, Esthonia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland,\r\n    Belgium, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Portugal, Spain,\r\n    Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Rumania,\r\n    Yugoslavia, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iraq, Arabia, Syria,\r\n    Palestine, Egypt, and Iran.\r\n\r\n    “Answer: I started off by taking the trouble to find out in the\r\n    case of the countries listed, firstly, whether they feel\r\n    themselves threatened, and secondly and particularly, whether\r\n    this question Mr. Roosevelt has asked us was put as the result\r\n    of a demarche by them or at least with their consent.\r\n\r\n    “The answer was a general negative, which in some cases took the\r\n    form of a blunt rejection. Actually, this counter-question of\r\n    mine could not be conveyed to some of the states and nations\r\n    listed, since they are not at present in possession of their\r\n    liberty (as for instance Syria), but are occupied by the\r\n    military forces of democratic states, and therefore, deprived of\r\n    all their rights.\r\n\r\n    “Thirdly, apart from that, all the states bordering on Germany\r\n    have received much more binding assurances and, above all, much\r\n    more binding proposals than Mr. Roosevelt asked of me in his\r\n    peculiar telegram.” (_TC-42-A_)\r\n\r\nAlthough that is sneering at Mr. Roosevelt, it is suggesting in the\r\npresence, among others, of Goering, as being quite absurd that Germany\r\nshould nurture any warlike feeling against its neighbors. The hollow\r\nfalsity of that declaration and of the preceding guarantee is shown by\r\nthe minutes of Hitler’s conference of the 23rd of May (_L-79_). The\r\nfirst page shows that those present included the Fuehrer, Goering,\r\nRaeder, von Brauchitsch, Keitel, Warlimont (Jodl’s deputy), and various\r\nothers. The purpose of the conference was an analysis of the situation,\r\nwhich proceeded in this fashion:\r\n\r\n    “What will this struggle be like?”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed\r\n    force. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, if England intends to intervene in the Polish war,\r\n    we must occupy Holland with lightning speed. We must aim at\r\n    securing a new defense line on Dutch soil up to the Zuider Zee.”\r\n    (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nIn Hitler’s speech on 22 August, the following passage occurred:\r\n\r\n    “Attack from the West from the Maginot Line: I consider this\r\n    impossible.\r\n\r\n    “Another possibility is the violation of Dutch, Belgium, and\r\n    Swiss neutrality. I have no doubts that all these states as well\r\n    as Scandinavia will defend their neutrality by all available\r\n    means. England and France will not violate the neutrality of\r\n    these countries.” (_798-PS_)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a further assurance was given by the Ambassador of Germany\r\nto the Belgian Government:\r\n\r\n    “In view of the gravity of the international situation, I am\r\n    expressly instructed by the Head of the German Reich to transmit\r\n    to Your Majesty the following communication:\r\n\r\n    “Though the German Government is at present doing everything in\r\n    its power to arrive at a peaceful solution of the questions at\r\n    issue between the Reich and Poland, it nevertheless desires to\r\n    define clearly, here and now, the attitude which it proposes to\r\n    adopt towards Belgium should a conflict in Europe become\r\n    inevitable.\r\n\r\n    “The German Government is firmly determined to abide by the\r\n    terms of the declaration contained in the German note of October\r\n    13, 1937. This provides in effect that Germany will in no\r\n    circumstances impair the inviolability of Belgium and will at\r\n    all times respect Belgium territory. The German Government\r\n    renews this undertaking; however, in, the expectation that the\r\n    Belgium Government, for its part, will observe an attitude of\r\n    strict neutrality and that Belgium will tolerate no violations\r\n    on the part of a third power, but that, on the contrary, she\r\n    will oppose it with all the forces at her disposal. It goes\r\n    without saying that if the Belgium Government were to adopt a\r\n    different attitude, the German Government would naturally be\r\n    compelled to defend its interests in conformity with the new\r\n    situation thus created.” (_TC-36_)\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the decision having been made to violate Belgian\r\nneutrality, those last words were put in to afford some excuse in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nA similar document assurance was communicated to Her Majesty the Queen\r\nof the Netherlands on the same day, 26 August 1939 (_TC-40_). Likewise\r\nassurances were given to Luxembourg at the same time. It is in the same\r\nterms as the other two assurances, and amounts to a complete guarantee\r\nwith the sting in the tail (_TC-42_). Poland was occupied by means of a\r\nlightning victory, and in October 1939 German armed forces were free for\r\nother tasks. The first step that was taken, so far as the Netherlands\r\nand Belgium are concerned, was a German assurance on 6 October 1939, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Belgium.\r\n\r\n    “Immediately after I had taken over the affairs of the state I\r\n    tried to create friendly relations with Belgium. I renounced any\r\n    revision or any desire for revision. The Reich has not made any\r\n    demands which would in any way be likely to be considered in\r\n    Belgium as a threat.” (_TC-32_)\r\n\r\nA similar assurance was made to the Netherlands on the same day:\r\n\r\n    “The new Reich has endeavored to continue the traditional\r\n    friendship with Holland. It has not taken over any existing\r\n    differences between the two countries and has not created any\r\n    new ones.” (_TC-32_)\r\n\r\nThe value of these pledges of Germany’s good faith is shown by an order\r\nissued on the very next day, 7 October. This order was from the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army, Von Brauchitsch, and was addressed to\r\nvarious Army Groups. The third paragraph provided:\r\n\r\n    “The Dutch Border between Ems and Rhine is to be observed only.\r\n\r\n    “At the same time, Army Group B has to make all preparations\r\n    according to special orders, for immediate invasion of Dutch and\r\n    Belgian territory, if the political situation so demands.”\r\n    (_2329-PS_)\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on 9 October, Hitler directed that:\r\n\r\n    “Preparations should be made for offensive action on the\r\n    northern flank of the Western Front crossing the area of\r\n    Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland. This attack must be carried out\r\n    as soon and as forcefully as possible. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The object of this attack is to acquire as great an area of\r\n    Holland, Belgium and Northern France as possible.” (_C-62_)\r\n\r\nThat document is signed by Hitler himself. It is addressed to the\r\nSupreme Commander of the Army, Keitel; Navy, Raeder; and Air Minister\r\nand Commander in Chief of the Air Force, Goering. On 15 October 1939, a\r\nsupplementary order was issued from the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\nForces. It was signed by Keitel in his familiar red pencil signature,\r\nand was addressed to Raeder, Goering, and the General Staff of the Army.\r\nIt declared, in part:\r\n\r\n    “It must be the object of the Army’s preparations, therefore, to\r\n    occupy—on receipt of a special order—the territory of Holland,\r\n    in the first instance as far as the Grebbe-Maas line.” (_C-62_)\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph deals with the taking possession of the\r\nWest-Frisian islands.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that from that moment the decision to violate the neutrality\r\nof these three countries had been made. All that remained was to work\r\nout the details, to wait until the weather became favorable, and in the\r\nmeantime, to give no hint that Germany’s word was about to be broken\r\nagain. Otherwise, these small countries might have had some chance of\r\ncombining with themselves and their neighbors.\r\n\r\nAnother Keitel directive, again sent to the Supreme Commanders of the\r\nArmy, Navy, and Air Forces, gives details of how the attack is to be\r\ncarried out. The following are pertinent passages:\r\n\r\n    “Contrary to previously issued instructions, all action intended\r\n    against Holland may be carried out without a special order which\r\n    the general attack will start.\r\n\r\n    “The attitude of the Dutch armed forces cannot be anticipated\r\n    ahead of time.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Wherever there is no resistance, the entry should carry the\r\n    character of a peaceful occupation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “At first the Dutch area, including the West-Frisian islands\r\n    situated just off the coast, for the present without Texel, is\r\n    to be occupied up to the Grebbe-Maas line.”\r\n\r\n    “The 7th Airborne Division will be committed for the airborne\r\n    operation only after the possession of bridges across the Albert\r\n    Canal” (in Belgium) “has been assured.” (_440-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to Belgium and Holland, the document, in paragraph (5) and\r\n(6)(b) mentions Luxembourg. The signature of Keitel is typed. It is\r\nauthenticated by a staff officer.\r\n\r\nA later order of 28 November 1939, over the signature of Keitel, in the\r\nusual red pencil, is addressed to the Army, Navy, and Airforce. It\r\nstates that if a quick breakthrough should fail north of Liege, other\r\nmachinery for carrying out the attack will be used. Paragraph 2 shows\r\nclearly that the Netherlands is to be violated. It speaks of “The\r\noccupation of Walcheren Island and thereby Flushing harbor, or of some\r\nother southern Dutch island especially valuable for our sea and air\r\nwarfare,” and “_b_ Taking of one or more Maas crossings between Namur\r\nand Dinant * * *.” (_C-10_)\r\n\r\nFrom November until March of 1940 the High Command and the Fuehrer were\r\nwaiting for favorable weather before A-Day, as they called it. That\r\nreferred to the attack on Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. The\r\nsuccessive postponements are shown in a series of orders which range in\r\ndate from 7 November 1939 until 9 May 1940, and which are all signed\r\neither by Keitel or by Jodl. (_C-72_)\r\n\r\nOn 10 January 1940, a German airplane made a forced landing in Belgium.\r\nThe occupants endeavored to burn the orders of which they were in\r\npossession, but they were only partially successful. Among the papers\r\nwhich were captured is an order to the Commander of the Second Army\r\nGroup, Air Force Group—Luftflotte—the Second Air Force Fleet, clearly\r\nfor offensive action against France, Holland, and Belgium. It deals with\r\nthe disposition of the Belgian Army. The Belgian Army covers the\r\nLiege-Antwerp Line. Then it deals with the disposition of the Dutch\r\nArmy. The German Western Army is accordingly directing its attack\r\nbetween the North Sea and the Moselle, with the strongest possible\r\nair-force support, through the Belgo-Luxembourg region. The rest\r\nconsists of operational details as to the bombing of the various targets\r\nin Belgium and in Holland. (_TC-58_)\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Army’s planning is shown in the 1 February 1940 entry\r\nin Jodl’s diary, which reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. Behavior of parachute units. In front of The Hague they have\r\n    to be strong enough to break in if necessary by sheer brute\r\n    force. The 7th Division intends to drop units near the town.\r\n\r\n    “2. Political mission contrasts to some extent with violent\r\n    action against the Dutch air force.” (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe entry for 2 February 1940 states that “landings can be made in the\r\ncentre of The Hague.” On 26 February Jodl wrote: “Fuehrer raises the\r\nquestion whether it is better to undertake the Weser Exercise before or\r\nafter case ‘Yellow.’” On 3 March, he recorded the answer: “Fuehrer\r\ndecides to carry out Weser Exercise before case ‘Yellow’, with a few\r\ndays’ interval.” And on May 8, two days before the invasion, Jodl made\r\nthis entry:\r\n\r\n    “Alarming news from Holland, cancelling of furloughs,\r\n    evacuations, road-blocks, other mobilization measures; according\r\n    to reports of the intelligence service the British have asked\r\n    for permission to march in, but the Dutch have refused.”\r\n    (_1809-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Germans objected because the Dutch were actually\r\nmaking some preparation to resist their endeavor. Furthermore, the Dutch\r\narmies, according to the Germans’ own intelligence reports, were still\r\nadhering properly to their neutrality.\r\n\r\nAt 4:30 a. m. on 10 May, the months of planning bore fruit, and Holland,\r\nBelgium, and Luxembourg were violently invaded with all the fury of\r\nmodern warfare. No warning was given by Germany and no complaint was\r\nmade by Germany of any breaches of neutrality before this action was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nAfter the invasion of each of the three countries was a fait accompli,\r\nthe German Ambassador called upon representatives of the three\r\nGovernments some hours later and handed them documents which were\r\nsimilar in each case, and which are described as memoranda or\r\nultimatums. An account of what happened in Belgium is contained in an\r\nofficial Belgian report:\r\n\r\n    “From 4:30 information was received which left no shadow of\r\n    doubt: the hour had struck. Aircraft were first reported in the\r\n    east. At five o’clock came news of the bombing of two\r\n    Netherlands aerodromes, the violation of the Belgian frontier,\r\n    the landing of German soldiers at the Eben-Emael Fort, the\r\n    bombing of the Jemelle station.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “At 8:30 the German Ambassador came to the Ministry of Foreign\r\n    Affairs. When he entered the Minister’s room, he began to take a\r\n    paper from his pocket. M. Spaak” [Belgian Foreign Minister]\r\n    “stopped him ‘I beg your pardon, Mr. Ambassador. I will speak\r\n    first.’ And in an indignant voice, he read the Belgian\r\n    Government’s protest: ‘Mr. Ambassador, the German Army has just\r\n    attacked our country. This is the second time in twenty-five\r\n    years that Germany has committed a criminal aggression against a\r\n    neutral and loyal Belgium. What has just happened is perhaps\r\n    even more odious than the aggression of 1914. No ultimatum, no\r\n    note, no protest of any kind has ever been placed before the\r\n    Belgian Government. It is through the attack itself that Belgium\r\n    has learned that Germany has violated the undertakings given by\r\n    her on October 13th, 1937, and renewed spontaneously at the\r\n    beginning of the war. The act of aggression committed by\r\n    Germany, for which there is no justification whatever, will\r\n    deeply shock the conscience of the world. The German Reich will\r\n    be held responsible by history. Belgium is resolved to defend\r\n    herself. Her cause, which is the cause of Right, cannot be\r\n    vanquished’.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Ambassador was then able to read the note he had brought:\r\n    ‘I am instructed by the Government of the Reich,’ he said, ‘to\r\n    make the following declaration: In order to forestall the\r\n    invasion of Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg, for which Great\r\n    Britain and France have been making preparations clearly aimed\r\n    at Germany, the Government of the Reich is compelled to ensure\r\n    the neutrality of the three countries mentioned by means of\r\n    arms. For this purpose, the Government of the Reich will bring\r\n    up an armed force of the greatest size, so that resistance of\r\n    any kind will be useless. The Government of the Reich guarantees\r\n    Belgium’s European and colonial territory, as well as her\r\n    dynasty, on condition that no resistance is offered. Should\r\n    there be any resistance, Belgium will risk the destruction of\r\n    her country and loss of her independence. It is therefore, in\r\n    the interests of Belgium that the population be called upon to\r\n    cease all resistance and that the authorities be given the\r\n    necessary instructions to make contact with the German Military\r\n    Command.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the middle of this communication, M. Spaak, who had by his\r\n    side the Secretary-General of the Department, interrupted the\r\n    Ambassador: ‘Hand me the document’, he said. ‘I should like to\r\n    spare you so painful a task.’ After studying the note, M. Spaak\r\n    confined himself to pointing out that he had already replied by\r\n    the protest he had just made. * * *” (_TC-58_)\r\n\r\nThe so-called ultimatum, which was delivered some hours after the\r\ninvasion had started, read in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Government has for a long time had no doubts as to\r\n    what was the chief aim of the British and French war policy. It\r\n    consists of the spreading of the war to other countries, and of\r\n    the misuse of their peoples as auxiliary and mercenary troops\r\n    for England and France.\r\n\r\n    “The last attempt of this sort was the plan to occupy\r\n    Scandinavia with the help of Norway, in order to set up a new\r\n    front against Germany in this region. It was only Germany’s last\r\n    minute action which upset the project. Germany has furnished\r\n    documentary evidence of this before the eyes of the world.\r\n\r\n    “Immediately after the British-French action in Scandinavia\r\n    miscarried, England and France took up their policy of war\r\n    expansion in another direction. In this respect, while the\r\n    retreat in flight of the British troops from Norway was still\r\n    going on, the English Prime Minister announced that, as a result\r\n    of the altered situation in Scandinavia, England was once more\r\n    in a position to go ahead with the transfer of the full weight\r\n    of her navy to the Mediterranean, and that English and French\r\n    units were already on the way to Alexandria. The Mediterranean\r\n    now became the center of English-French war propaganda. This was\r\n    partly to gloss over the Scandinavian defeat and the big loss of\r\n    prestige before their own people and before the world, and\r\n    partly to make it appear that the Balkans had been chosen for\r\n    the next theater of war against Germany.\r\n\r\n    “In reality, however, this apparent shifting to the\r\n    Mediterranean of English-French war policy had quite another\r\n    purpose. It was nothing but a diversion manoeuvre in grand\r\n    style, to deceive Germany as to the direction of the next\r\n    English-French attack. For, as the Reich Government has long\r\n    been aware, the true aim of England and France is the carefully\r\n    prepared and now immediately imminent attack on Germany in the\r\n    West, so as to advance through Belgium and Holland to the region\r\n    of the Ruhr.\r\n\r\n    “Germany has recognized and respected the inviolability of\r\n    Belgium and Holland, it being of course understood that these\r\n    two countries in the event of a war of Germany against England\r\n    and France would maintain the strictest neutrality.\r\n\r\n    “Belgium and the Netherlands have not fulfilled this condition.”\r\n    (_TC-57_)\r\n\r\nThe so-called ultimatum goes on to complain of the hostile expressions\r\nin the Belgian and the Netherlands Press, and to allege attempts by the\r\nBritish Intelligence to bring a revolution into Germany with the\r\nassistance of Belgium and the Netherlands. Reference is made to military\r\npreparation of the two countries, and it is pointed out that Belgium has\r\nfortified the Belgian frontier. A complaint was made in regard to\r\nHolland, that British aircraft had flown over the Netherlands country.\r\nOther charges were made against the neutrality of these two countries,\r\nalthough no instances were given (_TC-57_). The document continued:\r\n\r\n    “In this struggle for existence forced upon the German people by\r\n    England and France, the Reich Government is not disposed to\r\n    await submissively the attack by England and France and to allow\r\n    them to carry the war over Belgium and the Netherlands into\r\n    German territory. It has therefore now issued the command to\r\n    German troops to ensure the neutrality of these countries by all\r\n    the military means at the disposal of the Reich.” (_TC-57_)\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, in view of the documents previously adverted to, to\r\nemphasize the falsity of that statement. It is now known that for months\r\npreparations had been made to violate the neutrality of these three\r\ncountries. This document is merely saying, “The orders to do so have now\r\nbeen issued.”\r\n\r\nA similar document, similar in terms altogether, was handed to the\r\nrepresentatives of the Netherlands Government; and a memorandum was sent\r\nto the Luxembourg Government, which enclosed with it a copy of the\r\ndocument handed to the Governments of Belgium and the Netherlands. The\r\nsecond paragraph of the latter declared:\r\n\r\n    “In defense against the imminent attack, the German troops have\r\n    now received the order to safeguard the neutrality of these two\r\n    countries * * *”. (_TC-60_)\r\n\r\nThe protest of the Belgium Government against the crime which was\r\ncommitted against her is contained in _TC-59_.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO AGGRESSION AGAINST\r\n                BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS AND LUXEMBOURG\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F)  │      │\r\n                │  5; V.                                 │  I   │  27, 29\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

AGGRESSION AGAINST GREECE AND YUGOSLAVIA\r\n\r\nA. _Treaties and Assurances Breached._\r\n\r\nThe invasions of Greece and of Yugoslavia by the Germans, which took\r\nplace in the early hours of the morning of 6 April 1941, constituted\r\ndirect breaches of The Hague Convention of 1899 on the Pacific\r\nSettlement of International Disputes, and of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of\r\n1928. In the case of Yugoslavia, the invasion further constituted a\r\nbreach of an express assurance by the Nazis. The assurance was\r\noriginally given in a German Foreign Office release made in Berlin on 28\r\nApril 1938 (_2719-PS_), but was subsequently repeated by Hitler himself\r\non 6 October 1939 in a speech he made in the Reichstag. The German\r\nForeign Office release on 28 April 1938 reads, in part:\r\n\r\n    “Berlin, 28 April 1938. The State Secretary of the German\r\n    Foreign Office to the German Diplomatic Representatives.\r\n\r\n    “As a consequence of the reunion of Austria with the Reich, we\r\n    have now new frontiers with Italy, Yugoslavia, Switzerland,\r\n    Liechtenstein, and Hungary. These frontiers are regarded by us\r\n    as final and inviolable. On this point the following special\r\n    declarations have been made:”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “3. Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n    “The Yugoslav Government have been informed by authoritative\r\n    German quarters that German policy has no aims beyond Austria,\r\n    and that the Yugoslav frontier would in any case remain\r\n    untouched. In his speech made at Graz on 3 April, the Fuehrer\r\n    and Chancellor stated that, in regard to the reunion of Austria,\r\n    Yugoslavia and Hungary had adopted the same attitude as Italy.\r\n    We were happy to have frontiers there which relieved us of all\r\n    anxiety about providing military protection for them.”\r\n    (_2719-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a speech made on the occasion of the dinner in honor of the Prince\r\nRegent of Yugoslavia on 1 June 1939, Hitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “The German friendship for the Yugoslav nation is not only a\r\n    spontaneous one. It gained depth and durability in the midst of\r\n    the tragic confusion of the world war. The German soldier then\r\n    learned to appreciate and respect his extremely brave opponent.\r\n    I believe that this feeling was reciprocated. This mutual\r\n    respect finds confirmation in common political, cultural and\r\n    economic interests. We therefore look upon your Royal Highness’s\r\n    present visit as a living proof of the accuracy of our view, and\r\n    at the same time on that account we derive from it the hope that\r\n    German-Yugoslav friendship may continue further to develop in\r\n    the future and to grow ever closer.\r\n\r\n    “In the presence of your Royal Highness, however, we also\r\n    perceive a happy opportunity for a frank and friendly exchange\r\n    of views which, and of this I am convinced, in this sense can\r\n    only be fruitful to our two peoples and States. I believe this\r\n    all the more because a firmly established reliable relationship\r\n    of Germany to Yugoslavia, now that, owing to historical events,\r\n    we have become neighbors with common boundaries fixed for all\r\n    time, will not only guarantee lasting peace between our two\r\n    peoples and countries, but can also represent an element of calm\r\n    to our nerve-wracked continent. This peace is the goal of all\r\n    who are disposed to perform really constructive work.” (_TC-92_)\r\n\r\nAs is now known this speech was made at the time when Hitler had already\r\ndecided upon the European war. It occurred a week after the\r\nReichschancellery conference recorded in the Schmundt note (_L-79_). The\r\nreference to “nerve-wracked continent” might perhaps be attributed to\r\nthe war of nerves which Hitler had himself been conducting for many\r\nmonths. The German Assurance to Yugoslavia on 6 October 1939 was in\r\nthese terms:\r\n\r\n    “Immediately after the completion of the Anschluss I informed\r\n    Yugoslavia that, from now on, the frontier with this country\r\n    would also be an unalterable one, and that we only desire to\r\n    live in peace and friendship with her.” (_TC-43_)\r\n\r\nB. _Planning for Invasion: Collaboration with Italy and Bulgaria._\r\n\r\nDespite the obligation of Germany, under the Convention of 1899, and the\r\nKellogg-Briand Pact, and under the foregoing Assurance which I have\r\nread, the fate of both Greece and Yugoslavia had, as is now known, been\r\nsealed ever since the meeting between Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Ciano at\r\nObersalzberg, 12 and 13 August 1939 (_TC-77_). The effect of the meeting\r\nwas that Hitler and Ribbentrop, only two months after the dinner to the\r\nPrince Regent, were seeking to persuade Italy to make war on Yugoslavia\r\nat the same time that Germany was to commence hostilities against\r\nPoland, which Hitler had decided to do in the very near future. Ciano\r\nwhile evidently in entire agreement with Hitler and Ribbentrop as to the\r\ndesirability of liquidating Yugoslavia, and while himself anxious to\r\nsecure Salonika, stated that Italy was not yet ready for a general\r\nEuropean war. Thus, despite all the persuasion which Hitler and\r\nRibbentrop exerted at the meeting, it became necessary for the Nazi\r\nconspirators to reassure their intended victim, Yugoslavia, since in\r\nfact Italy maintained its position and did not enter the war when\r\nGermany invaded Poland, and since the Germans themselves were not yet\r\nready to strike in the Balkans. If was apparently for this reason that\r\non 6 October, through Hitler’s speech, the Nazis repeated the assurance\r\nthey had made in April 1938. It is a matter of history that after the\r\ndefeat of the Allied Armies in May and June 1940, the Italian Government\r\ndeclared war on France and that subsequently, at three o’clock in the\r\nmorning on 28 October 1940, the Italian Minister at Athens presented the\r\nGreek Government with a 3 hour ultimatum, upon the expiration of which\r\nItalian troops were already invading the soil of Greece.\r\n\r\nThis event was reported by the British Minister at Athens in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    “The president of the council has assured himself an outstanding\r\n    place in Greek history and, whatever the future may bring, his\r\n    foresight in quietly preparing his country for war and his\r\n    courage in rejecting without demur the Italian ultimatum when\r\n    delivered in the small hours of that October morning, will\r\n    surely obtain an honorable mention in the story of European\r\n    statecraft. He means to fight until Italy is completely defeated\r\n    and this reflects the purpose of the whole Greek nation.”\r\n\r\nA letter from Hitler to Mussolini, which is undated but which—this is\r\nclear from the contents—must have been written shortly after the\r\nItalian invasion of Greece on 28 November [transcriber's note: October]\r\n1940, contained these sentiments:\r\n\r\n    “Jugoslavia must become disinterested, if possible however from\r\n    our point of view interested in cooperating in the liquidation\r\n    of the Greek question. Without assurances from Jugoslavia, it is\r\n    useless to risk any successful operation in the Balkans.\r\n\r\n    “Unfortunately, I must stress the fact that waging a war in the\r\n    Balkans before March is impossible. Therefore, any threatening\r\n    move towards Jugoslavia would be useless, since the\r\n    impossibility of a materialization of such threats before March\r\n    is well known to the Serbian general staff. Therefore,\r\n    Jugoslavia must, if at all possible, be won over by other means\r\n    and other ways.” (_2762-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Hitler was making his plans for the offensive\r\nin the Spring of 1941, which included the invasion of Greece from the\r\nnorth. It was an integral part of those plans that Yugoslavia should be\r\ninduced to cooperate in them or at least to maintain a disinterested\r\nattitude towards the liquidation of the other Balkan States. These facts\r\nare disclosed in a “Top Secret Directive” issued from the Fuehrer’s\r\nHeadquarters, signed by Hitler, initialed by Jodl, and dated 12 November\r\n1940. This order reads, in part:\r\n\r\n    “_Directive No. 18._\r\n\r\n    “The preparatory measures of Supreme HQ for the prosecution of\r\n    the war in the near future are to be made along the following\r\n    lines.* * *” (_444-PS_)\r\n\r\nAfter sections dealing with operations against Gibraltar and an\r\noffensive against Egypt, the order continues:\r\n\r\n    “_Balkans_\r\n\r\n    “The commanders-in-chief of the Army will make preparations for\r\n    occupying the Greek mainland north of the Aegean Sea in case of\r\n    need, entering through Bulgaria, and thus make possible the use\r\n    of German air force units against targets in the Eastern\r\n    Mediterranean, in particular against those English air bases\r\n    which are threatening the Rumanian oil area.\r\n\r\n    “In order to be able to face all eventualities and to keep\r\n    Turkey in check, the use of an army group of an approximate\r\n    strength of ten divisions is to be the basis for the planning\r\n    and the calculations of deployment. It will not be possible to\r\n    count on the railway, leading through Yugoslavia, for moving\r\n    these forces into position.\r\n\r\n    “So as to shorten the time needed for the deployment,\r\n    preparations will be made for an early increase in the German\r\n    Army mission in Roumania, the extent of which must be submitted\r\n    to me.\r\n\r\n    “_The commander-in-chief of the Air Force_ will make\r\n    preparations for the use of German Air Force units in the South\r\n    East Balkans and for aerial reconnaissance on the southern\r\n    border of Bulgaria, in accordance with the intended ground\r\n    operations.” (_444-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe positions of the Italian invading forces in Greece in December 1940\r\nmay be summarized in the words in which the British Minister reported to\r\nForeign Secretary Eden:\r\n\r\n    “The morale of the Greek Army throughout has been of the\r\n    highest, and our own naval and land successes at Tarento and in\r\n    the Western Desert have done much to maintain it. With\r\n    relatively poor armaments and the minimum of equipment and\r\n    modern facilities they have driven back or captured superior\r\n    Italian forces more frequently than not at the point of the\r\n    bayonet. The modern Greeks have thus shown that they are not\r\n    unworthy of the ancient tradition of their country and that\r\n    they, like their distant forbears, are prepared to fight against\r\n    odds to maintain their freedom.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Italians were getting the worst of it, and it was time that\r\nHitler came to the rescue with the order for the German attack on\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nThis Directive of 13 December 1940, which is Top Secret Directive number\r\n20, dealing with Operation _Marita_, bears a distribution list which\r\nshows that copies went to the Commander of the Navy (Raeder), to the\r\nCommander of the Air Force (Goering), to the Supreme Commander of the\r\nArmed Forces (Keitel), and to the Command Staff (Jodl). The first two\r\nparagraphs state:\r\n\r\n    “The result of the battles in Albania is not yet decisive.\r\n    Because of a dangerous situation in Albania it is doubly\r\n    necessary that the British endeavour be foiled to create air\r\n    bases under the protection of a Balkan front, which would be\r\n    dangerous above all to Italy as well as to the Rumanian oil\r\n    fields.\r\n\r\n    “My plan, therefore, is (_a_) to form a slowly increasing task\r\n    force in Southern Rumania within the next months. (_b_) After\r\n    the setting in of favorable weather, probably in March, to send\r\n    the task force for the occupation of the Aegean North coast by\r\n    way of Bulgaria, and if necessary to occupy the entire Greek\r\n    mainland (Operation _Marita_). The support of Bulgaria is to be\r\n    expected.” (_1541-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe next paragraph gives the forces for the operation, and paragraph 4\r\ndeals with the operation Marita itself. Paragraph 5 states:\r\n\r\n    “The Military preparations which will produce exceptional\r\n    political results in the Balkans demand the exact control of all\r\n    the necessary measures by the General Staff. The transport\r\n    through Hungary and the arrival in Rumania will be reported step\r\n    by step by the General Staff of the Armed Forces, and are to be\r\n    explained at first as a strengthening of the German Army mission\r\n    in Rumania.\r\n\r\n    “Consultations with the Rumanians or the Bulgarians which may\r\n    point to our intentions as well as notification of the Italians\r\n    are each subject to my consent, also the sending of scouting\r\n    missions and advanced parties.” (_1541-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother “Top Secret Directive” carries the plan a little farther. It\r\ndeals with decisive action in support of the Italian forces in Tripoli\r\nand in Albania. The first short paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n    “The situation in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations\r\n    demands for strategical political and psychological reasons\r\n    German assistance, due to employment of superior forces by\r\n    England against our allies.” (_448-PS_)\r\n\r\nParagraph three, after dealing with the forces to be transferred to\r\nAlbania, sets out what the duties of the German forces will be:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ To serve in Albania for the time being as a reserve for an\r\n    emergency case, should new crises arise there.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ To ease the burden of the Italian Army group when later\r\n    attacking with the aim:\r\n\r\n    “To tear open the Greek defense front on a decisive point for a\r\n    far-reaching operation.\r\n\r\n    “To open up the straits west of Salonika from the back in order\r\n    to support thereby the frontal attack of List’s Army.”\r\n    (_448-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat directive was signed by Hitler, and, as shown on the original, was\r\ninitialed by both Keitel and Jodl. A copy went to Raeder, and the copy\r\nsent to Foreign Intelligence presumably reached Ribbentrop.\r\n\r\nA conference took place on 19 and 20 January between Keitel and the\r\nItalian General, Guzzoni. This was followed by a meeting between Hitler\r\nand Mussolini, at which Ribbentrop, Keitel, and Jodl were present. In\r\nthe speech which the Fuehrer made on 20 January 1941, after the\r\nconference with the Italians, he declared:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The massing of troops in Roumania serves a threefold\r\n    purpose:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ An operation against Greece.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Protection of Bulgaria against Russia and Turkey.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Safeguarding the guarantee to Roumania.\r\n\r\n    “Each of these tasks requires its own group of forces,\r\n    altogether therefore very strong forces whose deployment far\r\n    from our base requires a long time.\r\n\r\n    “Desirable that this deployment is completed without\r\n    interference from the enemy. Therefore disclose the game as late\r\n    as possible. The tendency will be to cross the Danube at the\r\n    last possible moment and to line up for attack at the earliest\r\n    possible moment.” (_C-134_)\r\n\r\nAt a conference between Field Marshal List and the Bulgarians, on 8\r\nFebruary, the following plans were discussed:\r\n\r\n    “Minutes of questions discussed between the representatives of\r\n    the Royal Bulgarian General Staff and the German Supreme\r\n    Command—General Field Marshal List—in connection with the\r\n    possible movement of German troops through Bulgaria and their\r\n    commitment against Greece and possibly against Turkey, if she\r\n    should involve herself in the war.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Bulgarian and the German general staff will take all\r\n    measures in order to camouflage the preparation of the\r\n    operations and to assure in this way the most favorable\r\n    conditions for the execution of the German operations as\r\n    planned.\r\n\r\n    “The representatives of the two general staffs consider it to be\r\n    suitable to inform their governments that it will be good to\r\n    take the necessity of secrecy and surprise into consideration\r\n    when the three-power treaty is signed by Bulgaria, in order to\r\n    assure the success of the military operations.” (_1746-PS_)\r\n\r\nA further top secret directive of 19 February sets the date for the\r\nOperation _Marita_ (_C-59_). It states that the bridge across the Danube\r\nis to be begun on 28 February, the river crossed on 2 March, and the\r\nfinal orders to be issued on 26 February at the latest. On the original\r\nof this order the actual dates are filled in in the handwriting of\r\nKeitel.\r\n\r\nThe position of Bulgaria at this moment was this: Bulgaria adhered to\r\nthe Three-Power Pact on 1 March 1941. On the same day the entry of\r\nGerman troops into Bulgaria began in accordance with the Plan _Marita_\r\nand associated directives already referred to. The landing of British\r\ntroops in Greece on 3 March, in accordance with the guarantee given in\r\nthe spring of 1939 by the British Government, may have accelerated the\r\nmovement of the German forces. In any event, as has been shown, the\r\ninvasion of Greece had been planned long beforehand and was already in\r\nprogress at this time.\r\n\r\nA short extract from a report by Raeder on an interview with Hitler,\r\nwhich the original shows took place in the presence of Keitel and Jodl\r\nat 1600 hours on 18 March, shows the ruthless nature of the German\r\nintentions:\r\n\r\n    “The C in C of the Navy asks for confirmation that the whole of\r\n    Greece will have to be occupied even in the event of a peaceful\r\n    settlement.\r\n\r\n    “_Fuehrer_: The complete occupation is a prerequisite of any\r\n    settlement.” (_C-167_)\r\n\r\nThis report shows, it seems clear, that the Nazi conspirators, in\r\naccordance with their principle of liquidating any neutral which did not\r\nremain disinterested, had made every preparation by the end of January\r\nand were at this date in the process of moving the necessary troops to\r\nensure the final liquidation of Greece, which was already at war with,\r\nand getting the better of, their Italian allies.\r\n\r\nC. _Lulling the Unsuspecting Victim._\r\n\r\nThey were not yet, however, ready to deal with Yugoslavia, towards which\r\ntheir policy accordingly remained one of lulling the unsuspecting\r\nvictim. On 25 March, in accordance with this policy, the adherence of\r\nYugoslavia to the Three-Power Pact was secured. This adherence followed\r\na visit on 15 February 1941 by the Yugoslav Premier Cvetkovic and the\r\nForeign Minister Cinkar-Markvic to Ribbentrop at Salzburg and\r\nsubsequently to Hitler at Berchtesgaden, after which these ministers\r\nwere induced to sign the Pact at Vienna on 25 March. On this occasion\r\nRibbentrop wrote the two letters of assurance. The first made this\r\nguarantee:\r\n\r\n    “Notes of the Axis Governments to Belgrade.\r\n\r\n    “At the same time, when the protocol on the entry of Yugoslavia\r\n    to the Tri-Partite Pact was signed, the governments of the Axis\r\n    Powers sent to the Yugoslavian Government the following\r\n    identical notes:\r\n\r\n    “‘Mr. Prime Minister:\r\n\r\n    “‘In the name of the German Government and at its behest, I have\r\n    the honor to inform Your Excellency of the following:\r\n\r\n    “‘On the occasion of the Yugoslavian entry today into the\r\n    Tri-Partite Pact, the German Government confirms its\r\n    determination to respect the sovereignty and territorial\r\n    integrity of Yugoslavia at all times.’” (_2450-PS_)\r\n\r\nThat letter was signed by Ribbentrop, who was present at the meeting in\r\nAugust 1939 when he and Hitler tried to persuade the Italians to invade\r\nYugoslavia. It was in fact 11 days after this letter was written that\r\nthe Germans did invade Yugoslavia, and two days after the letter was\r\nwritten that they issued the necessary order.\r\n\r\nThe second letter reads:\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Prime Minister:\r\n\r\n    “With reference to the conversations that occurred in connection\r\n    with the Yugoslavian entry into the Tri-Partite Pact, I have the\r\n    honor to confirm to Your Excellency herewith in the name of the\r\n    Reich Cabinet [Reichsregierung], that in the agreement between\r\n    the Axis powers and the Royal Yugoslavian Government, the\r\n    governments of the Axis powers during this war will not direct a\r\n    demand to Yugoslavia to permit the march or transportation of\r\n    troops through Yugoslavian national territory.” (_2450-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe position at this stage, 25 March 1941, was therefore that German\r\ntroops were already in Bulgaria moving towards the Greek frontier, while\r\nYugoslavia had, to use Hitler’s own term in his letter to Mussolini,\r\n“become disinterested” in the cleaning up of the Greek question.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the adherence of Yugoslavia to the Three-Power Pact\r\nappears very clearly from an extract from the minutes of a meeting\r\nbetween Hitler and Ciano. The first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer first expressed his satisfaction with Yugoslavia’s\r\n    joining the Tri-Partite Pact and the resulting definition of her\r\n    position. This is of special importance in view of the proposed\r\n    military action against Greece, for, if one considers that for\r\n    350 to 400 kilometers the important line of communication\r\n    through Bulgaria runs within 20 kilometers of the Yugoslav\r\n    border, one can judge that with a dubious attitude of Yugoslavia\r\n    an undertaking against Greece would have been militarily an\r\n    extremely foolhardy venture.” (_2765-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a matter of history that on the night of 26 March 1941,\r\nwhen the two Yugoslav ministers returned to Belgrade, General Simovic\r\nand his colleagues effected their removal by a _coup d’état_, and\r\nYugoslavia emerged on the morning of 27 March ready to defend, if need\r\nbe, its independence.\r\n\r\nD. _Further Planning for Attack._\r\n\r\nThe Nazis reacted rapidly to this altered situation, and the immediate\r\nliquidation of Yugoslavia was decided on. A conference of Hitler and the\r\nGerman High Command on the situation in Yugoslavia took place on 27\r\nMarch 1941. Those present included the Fuehrer; the Reich Marshall\r\n(Goering); Chief, OKW, (Keitel); and the Chief of the _Wehrmacht\r\nFuehrungstab_, (Jodl). A report of the conference notes that “later on\r\nthe following persons were added,” and among them is included Ribbentrop\r\n(_1746-PS_). Hitler’s statement proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer describes Yugoslavia’s situation after the _coup\r\n    d’état_. Statement that Yugoslavia was an uncertain factor in\r\n    regard to the coming Marita action and even more in regard to\r\n    the Barbarossa undertaking later on. Serbs and Slovenes were\r\n    never pro-German.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The present moment is for political and military reasons\r\n    favorable for us to ascertain the actual situation in the\r\n    country and the country’s attitude toward us, for if the\r\n    overthrow of the Government would have happened during the\r\n    Barbarossa action, the consequences for us probably would have\r\n    been considerably more serious.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer is determined, without waiting for possible loyalty\r\n    declarations of the new government, to make all preparations in\r\n    order to destroy Yugoslavia militarily and as a national unit.\r\n    No diplomatic inquiries will be made nor ultimatums presented.\r\n    Assurances of the Yugoslav government, which cannot be trusted\r\n    anyhow in the future will be taken note of. The attack will\r\n    start as soon as the means and troops suitable for it are ready.\r\n\r\n    “It is important that actions will be taken as fast as possible.\r\n    An attempt will be made to let the bordering states participate\r\n    in a suitable way. An actual military support against Yugoslavia\r\n    is to be requested of Italy, Hungary, and in certain respects of\r\n    Bulgaria too. Roumania’s main task is the protection against\r\n    Russia. The Hungarian and the Bulgarian ambassador have already\r\n    been notified. During the day a message will still be addressed\r\n    to the Duce.\r\n\r\n    “Politically, it is especially important that the blow against\r\n    Yugoslavia is carried out with unmerciful harshness and that the\r\n    military destruction is done in a lightning-like undertaking. In\r\n    this way, Turkey would become sufficiently frightened and the\r\n    campaign against Greece later on would be influenced in a\r\n    favorable way. It can be assumed that the Croats will come to\r\n    our side when we attack. A corresponding political treatment\r\n    (autonomy later on) will be assured to them. The war against\r\n    Yugoslavia should be very popular in Italy, Hungary and\r\n    Bulgaria, as territorial acquisitions are to be promised to\r\n    these states; the Adria coast for Italy, the Banat for Hungary,\r\n    and Macedonia for Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n    “This plan assumes that we speed up the schedule of all\r\n    preparations and use such strong forces that the Yugoslav\r\n    collapse will take place within the shortest time.” (_1746-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus it appears that two days after Yugoslavia had signed the\r\nTri-Partite Pact and the Nazis had given assurances, simply because\r\nthere had been a _coup d’état_ and it was possible that the operations\r\nagainst Greece might be affected, the destruction of Yugoslavia was\r\ndecided on without any question of taking the trouble to ascertain the\r\nviews of the new Government.\r\n\r\nThe report of the meeting continues:\r\n\r\n    “5. The main task of the Air Force is to start as early as\r\n    possible with the destruction of the Yugoslavian Air Force\r\n    ground installations and to destroy the capital Belgrade in\r\n    attacks by waves.” (_1746-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is again a matter of history that the residential areas of Belgrade\r\nwere bombed at 7 o’clock on the following Sunday morning, 6 April 1941.\r\n\r\nAt that same meeting of 27 March 1941 a tentative plan, drawn up by\r\nJodl, was offered:\r\n\r\n    “In the event that the political development requires an armed\r\n    intervention against Yugoslavia, it is the German intention to\r\n    attack Yugoslavia in a concentric way as soon as possible, to\r\n    destroy her armed forces, and to dissolve her national\r\n    territory.” (_1746-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn order (Directive No. 25) was issued after the meeting of 27 March.\r\nThe first paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n    “The military putsch in Yugoslavia has altered the political\r\n    situation in the Balkans. Yugoslavia must, in spite of her\r\n    protestations of loyalty, for the time being be considered as an\r\n    enemy and therefore be crushed as speedily as possible.”\r\n    (_C-127_)\r\n\r\nAs another result of the meeting, a telegram, containing a letter from\r\nHitler to Mussolini, was forwarded to the German Ambassador in Rome by\r\nHitler and Ribbentrop. It was written to advise Mussolini of the course\r\ndecided on, and under the guise of somewhat fulsome language the Duce\r\nwas given his orders. The first five paragraphs read:\r\n\r\n    “Duce, Events force me to give you, Duce, by this the quickest\r\n    means, my estimation of the situation and the consequences which\r\n    may result from it.\r\n\r\n    “(1) From the beginning I have regarded Yugoslavia as a\r\n    dangerous factor in the controversy with Greece. Considered from\r\n    the purely military point of view, German intervention in the\r\n    war in Thrace would not be at all justified, as long as the\r\n    attitude of Yugoslavia remains ambiguous and she could threaten\r\n    the left flank of the advancing columns, on our enormous front.\r\n\r\n    “(2) For this reason I have done everything and honestly have\r\n    endeavored to bring Yugoslavia into our community bound together\r\n    by mutual interests. Unfortunately these endeavors did not meet\r\n    with success, or they were begun too late to produce any\r\n    definite result. Today’s reports leave no doubt as to the\r\n    imminent turn in the foreign policy of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n    “(3) I don’t consider this situation as being catastrophic, but\r\n    nevertheless a difficult one, and we on our part must avoid any\r\n    mistake if we do not want in the end to endanger our whole\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    “(4) Therefore I have already arranged for all necessary\r\n    measures in order to meet a critical development with necessary\r\n    military means. The change in the deployment of our troops has\r\n    been ordered also in Bulgaria. Now I would cordially request\r\n    you, Duce, not to undertake any further operations in Albania in\r\n    the course of the next few days. I consider it necessary that\r\n    you should cover and screen the most important passes from\r\n    Yugoslavia into Albania with all available forces.\r\n\r\n    “These measures should not be considered as designed for a long\r\n    period of time, but as auxiliary measures designed to prevent\r\n    for at least fourteen days to three weeks a crisis arising.\r\n\r\n    “I also consider it necessary, Duce, that you should reinforce\r\n    your forces on the Italian-Yugoslav front with all available\r\n    means and with utmost speed.\r\n\r\n    “(5) I also consider it necessary, Duce, that everything which\r\n    we do and order be shrouded in absolute secrecy and that only\r\n    personalities who necessarily must be notified know anything\r\n    about them. These measures will completely lose their value\r\n    should they become known.” (_1835-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler continues with a further emphasis on the importance of secrecy.\r\nAn operational order (_R-95_) followed, which was signed by General von\r\nBrauchitsch, and which merely passed to the Armies the orders contained\r\nin Directive No. 25. (_C-127_)\r\n\r\nE. _Explanations._\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia took place in the morning of 6\r\nApril 1941. On that day Hitler issued a proclamation (_TC-93_). The\r\nfollowing passage is an extract:\r\n\r\n    “From the beginning of the struggle it has been England’s\r\n    steadfast endeavor to make the Balkans a theatre of war. British\r\n    diplomacy did, in fact, using the model of the World War,\r\n    succeed in first ensnaring Greece by a guarantee offered to her,\r\n    and then finally in misusing her for Britain’s purposes.\r\n\r\n    “The documents published today [the German ‘White Book’] afford\r\n    a glimpse of a practice which, in accordance with very old\r\n    British recipes, is a constant attempt to induce others to fight\r\n    and bleed for British interests.\r\n\r\n    “In the face of this I have always emphasized that:\r\n\r\n    “(1) The German people have no antagonism to the Greek people\r\n    but that\r\n\r\n    “(2) We shall never, as in the World War, tolerate a power\r\n    establishing itself on Greek territory with the object at a\r\n    given time of being able to advance thence from the southeast\r\n    into German living space. We have swept the northern flank free\r\n    of the English; we are resolved not to tolerate such a threat in\r\n    the south.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In the interests of a genuine consolidation of Europe it has\r\n    been my endeavor since the day of my assumption of power above\r\n    all to establish a friendly relationship with Yugoslavia. I have\r\n    consciously put out of mind everything that once took place\r\n    between Germany and Serbia. I have not only offered the Serbian\r\n    people the hand of the German people, but in addition have made\r\n    efforts as an honest broker to assist in bridging all\r\n    difficulties which existed between the Yugoslav State and\r\n    various Nations allied to Germany.” (_TC-93_)\r\n\r\nOne can only think that when he issued that proclamation Hitler must\r\nmomentarily have forgotten the meeting with Ciano in August 1939, and\r\nthe meeting with Ribbentrop and the others on 27 March, a few days\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture delivered by Jodl on 7 November 1943, he sets out his\r\nviews, two and a half years later on the action taken in April, 1941. In\r\nParagraph 11 he stated:\r\n\r\n    “What was, however, less acceptable was the necessity of\r\n    affording our assistance as an Ally in the Balkans in\r\n    consequence of the ‘extra-turn’ of the Italians against Greece.\r\n    The attack, which they launched in the autumn of 1940 from\r\n    Albania with totally inadequate means was contrary to all\r\n    agreement but in the end led to a decision on our part\r\n    which—taking a long view of the matter—would have become\r\n    necessary in any case sooner or later. The planned attack on\r\n    Greece from the North was not executed merely as an operation in\r\n    aid of an ally. Its real purpose was to prevent the British from\r\n    gaining a foothold in Greece and from menacing our Roumanian oil\r\n    area from that country.” (_L-172_)\r\n\r\nF. _Summary._\r\n\r\nTo summarize: The invasion of Greece was decided on at least as early as\r\nNovember or December 1940 and was scheduled for the end of March or the\r\nbeginning of April, 1941. No consideration was at any time given to any\r\nobligations under treaties or conventions which might make such invasion\r\na breach of International Law. Care was taken to conceal the\r\npreparations so that the German Forces might have an unsuspecting\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Yugoslavia, although to be liquidated in due course,\r\nwas clearly better left for a later stage. Every effort was made to\r\nsecure her cooperation for the offensive against Greece, or at least to\r\nensure that she would abstain from any interference.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d’état_ of General Simovic upset this plan and it was then\r\ndecided that, irrespective of whether or not his Government had any\r\nhostile intentions towards Germany, or even of supporting the Greeks,\r\nYugoslavia must be liquidated.\r\n\r\nIt was not worth while to the Nazis to take any steps to ascertain\r\nYugoslavia’s intentions, for it would be so little trouble, now that the\r\nGerman troops were deployed, to destroy her militarily and as a national\r\nunit. Accordingly, in the early hours of Sunday morning, 6 April 1941,\r\nGerman troops marched into Yugoslavia without warning and into Greece\r\nsimultaneously. The formality was observed of handing a note to the\r\nGreek Minister in Berlin, informing him that the German forces were\r\nentering Greece to drive out the British. M. Koryzis, the Greek\r\nMinister, in replying to information of the invasion from the German\r\nEmbassy, replied that history was repeating itself and that Greece was\r\nbeing attacked by Germany in the same way as by Italy. Greece returned,\r\nhe said, the same reply as it had given to the Italians in the preceding\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nG. _The Pattern of Aggression._\r\n\r\nThere is one common factor which runs through the whole of the Nazi\r\naggressions. It is an element in the diplomatic technique of aggression,\r\nwhich was used with singular consistency, not only by the Nazis\r\nthemselves, but also by their Italian friends. Their technique was\r\nessentially based upon securing the maximum advantage from surprise,\r\neven though only a few hours of unopposed military advance into the\r\ncountry of the unsuspecting victim could thus be secured. Thus, there\r\nwas, of course, no declaration of war in the case of Poland.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Norway and of Denmark began in the small hours of the\r\nnight of April 8-9 1940, and was well under way as a military operation,\r\nbefore the diplomatic explanations and excuses were presented to the\r\nDanish Foreign Minister, at 4:20 a. m. on the morning of the 9th, and to\r\nthe Norwegian Minister, between half past four and five on that morning.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland began not later than\r\nfive o’clock, in the small hours of 10 of May, 1940, while the formal\r\nultimatum, delivered in each case with the diplomatic excuses and\r\nexplanations, was not presented until afterwards. In the ease of Holland\r\nthe invasion began between three and four in the morning. It was not\r\nuntil about six, when The Hague had already been bombed, that the German\r\nMinister asked to see M. van Kleffens. In the case of Belgium, where the\r\nbombing began at five, the German Minister did not see M. Spaak until\r\neight. The invasion of Luxembourg began at four and it was at seven when\r\nthe German Minister asked to see M. Beck.\r\n\r\nMussolini copied this technique. It was 3 o’clock on the morning of 28\r\nOctober 1940 when his Minister in Athens presented a three hour\r\nultimatum to General Metaxas.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia, also, both began in the small\r\nhours of 6 April 1941. In the case of Yugoslavia no diplomatic exchange\r\ntook place even after the event, but a proclamation was issued by Hitler\r\nat five o’clock that Sunday morning, some two hours before Belgrade was\r\nbombed. In the case of Greece, it was at twenty minutes past five that\r\nM. Koryzis was informed that German troops were entering Greek\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this long series of aggressions was carried out is,\r\nin itself, further evidence of the essentially aggressive and\r\ntreacherous character of the Nazi regime: to attack without warning at\r\nnight to secure an initial advantage, and to proffer excuses or reasons\r\nafterwards. This is clearly the method of the State which has no respect\r\nfor its own pledged word, nor for the rights of any people but its own.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to speculate whether this technique was evolved by\r\nthe “honest broker” himself or by his honest clerk, Ribbentrop.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO AGGRESSION AGAINST\r\n                         GREECE AND YUGOSLAVIA\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F)  │      │\r\n                │  5; V.                                 │  I   │  27, 29\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

AGGRESSION AGAINST THE U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\nA. _Inception of the Plan._\r\n\r\nThe point of departure for the story of the aggression against the\r\nSoviet Union is the date, 23 August 1939. On that day—just a week\r\nbefore the invasion of Poland—the Nazi conspirators caused Germany to\r\nenter into the Treaty of Non-Aggression with the U.S.S.R. This Treaty\r\n(_TC-25_) contained two significant articles:\r\n\r\n    “Article 1: The two contracting parties undertake to refrain\r\n    from any act of violence, any aggressive action, or any attack\r\n    against one another, whether individually or jointly with other\r\n    powers.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Article 5: Should disputes or conflicts arise between the\r\n    contracting parties regarding questions of any kind whatsoever,\r\n    the two partners would clear away these disputes or conflicts\r\n    solely by friendly exchanges of views or if necessary by\r\n    arbitration commission.” (_TC-25_)\r\n\r\nThe Treaty was signed for the U.S.S.R. by the Soviet Foreign Minister\r\nMolotov, and for the German Government by Ribbentrop. Its announcement\r\ncame as somewhat of a surprise to the world, since it appeared to\r\nconstitute a reversal of the previous trend of Nazi foreign policy. The\r\nexplanation for this about face was provided, however, by Ribbentrop\r\nhimself, in a discussion which he had with the Japanese Ambassador,\r\nOshima, at Fuchel on 23 February 1941. A report of that conference was\r\nforwarded by Ribbentrop to certain German diplomats in the field for\r\ntheir strictly confidential and purely personal information (_1834-PS_).\r\nRibbentrop told Oshima the reason for the Pact with the U.S.S.R. in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n    “Then when it came to war the Fuehrer decided on a treaty with\r\n    Russia—a necessity for avoiding a two-front war. Perhaps this\r\n    moment was difficult for Japan. The treaty was, however, in the\r\n    interest of Japan, for the Japanese empire was interested in as\r\n    rapid a German victory as possible, which was assured by the\r\n    treaty with Russia.” (_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn view of this spirit of opportunism which motivated the Nazi\r\nConspirators in entering into this solemn pledge of arbitration and\r\nnonaggression, it is not surprising to find that they regarded it, as\r\nthey did all Treaties and Pledges, as binding on them only so long as it\r\nwas expedient for them to do so. That they did so regard it is evident\r\nfrom the fact that, even while the campaign in the West was still in\r\nprogress, they began to consider the possibility of launching a war of\r\naggression against the U.S.S.R. In a speech to the Reichsleiters and\r\nGauleiters at Munich in November 1943, Jodl admitted that:\r\n\r\n    “Parallel with all these developments realization was steadily\r\n    growing of the danger drawing constantly nearer from the\r\n    Bolshevik East—that danger which has been only too little\r\n    perceived in Germany and latterly, for diplomatic reasons, had\r\n    deliberately to be ignored. However, the Fuehrer himself has\r\n    always kept this danger steadily in view and even as far back as\r\n    during the Western Campaign had informed me of his fundamental\r\n    decision to take steps against this danger the moment our\r\n    military position made it at all possible.” (_L-172_)\r\n\r\nAt the time this statement was made, however, the Western Campaign was\r\nstill in progress and so any action in the East necessarily had to be\r\npostponed for the time being. On 22 June 1940, however, the\r\nFranco-German armistice was signed at Compiegne and the campaign in the\r\nWest, with the exception of the war against Britain, came to an end. The\r\nview that Germany’s key to political and economic dominance lay in the\r\nelimination of the U.S.S.R. as a political factor, and in the\r\nacquisition of _lebensraum_ at her expense, had long been basic in Nazi\r\nideology. This idea had never been completely forgotten, even while the\r\nwar in the West was in progress. Now, flushed with the recent success of\r\ntheir arms and yet keenly conscious of both their failure to defeat\r\nBritain and the needs of their armies for food and raw materials, the\r\nNazi conspirators began serious consideration of the means for achieving\r\ntheir traditional ambition by conquering the Soviet Union. The situation\r\nin which Germany now found herself made such action appear both\r\ndesirable and practicable.\r\n\r\nAs early as August of 1940, General Thomas received a hint from Goering\r\nthat planning for a campaign against the Soviet Union was already under\r\nway. Thomas at that time was the Chief of the _Wirtschaft Rustung Amt_,\r\nor Office for Economy and Armaments, of the OKW (_Wi Rue Amt_). General\r\nThomas tells about receiving this information from Goering in his draft\r\nof a work entitled “Basic Facts For a History of German War and\r\nArmaments Economy,” which he prepared during the Summer of 1944\r\n(_2353-PS_). On pages 313 to 315 of this work, Thomas discusses the\r\nRusso-German trade agreement of 1939 and relates that, since the Soviets\r\nwere delivering quickly and well under this agreement and were\r\nrequesting war materials in return, there was much pressure in Germany\r\nuntil early 1940 for increased delivery on the part of the Germans.\r\nHowever, at page 315 he has the following to say about the change of\r\nheart expressed by the German leaders in August of 1940:\r\n\r\n    “On August 14, the Chief of Wi Rue, during a conference with\r\n    Reichmarshal Goering, was informed, that the Fuehrer desired\r\n    punctual delivery to the Russians only till spring 1941. Later\r\n    on we would have no further interest in completely satisfying\r\n    the Russian demands. This allusion moved the Chief of Wi Rue to\r\n    give priority to matters concerning Russian War Economy.”\r\n    (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis statement will be referred to again later in the discussion of\r\npreparations for the economic exploitation of Soviet territory. At that\r\ntime too, evidence will be presented that in November of 1940 Goering\r\ncategorically informed Thomas that a campaign was planned against the\r\nU.S.S.R.\r\n\r\nPreparations for so large an undertaking as an invasion of the Soviet\r\nUnion necessarily entailed, even this many months in advance of the date\r\nof execution, certain activity in the East in the way of construction\r\nprojects and strengthening of forces. Such activity could not be\r\nexpected to pass unnoticed by the Soviet intelligence service.\r\nCounter-intelligence measures were obviously called for. In an OKW\r\ndirective signed by Jodl and issued to the Counter-Intelligence Service\r\nAbroad on 6 September 1940, such measures were ordered (_1229-PS_). This\r\ndirective pointed out that the activity in the East must not be\r\npermitted to create the impression in the Soviet Union that an offensive\r\nwas being prepared and outlined the line for the counter-intelligence\r\npeople to take to disguise this fact. The text of the directive\r\nindicates, by necessary implication, the extent of the preparations\r\nalready underway. It provides:\r\n\r\n    “The Eastern territory will be manned stronger in the weeks to\r\n    come. By the end of October the status shown on the enclosed map\r\n    is supposed to be reached.\r\n\r\n    “These regroupings must not create the impression in Russia that\r\n    we are preparing an offensive in the East. On the other hand,\r\n    Russia will realize that strong and highly trained German troops\r\n    are stationed in the Gouvernement, in the Eastern provinces, and\r\n    in the Protekterat; she should draw the conclusion that we can\r\n    at any time protect our interests—especially on the\r\n    Balkan—with strong forces against Russian seizure.\r\n\r\n    “For the work of our own intelligence service as well as for the\r\n    answer to questions of the Russian intelligence service, the\r\n    following directives apply:\r\n\r\n    “1. The respective total strength of the German troops in the\r\n    East is to be veiled as far as possible by giving news about a\r\n    frequent change of the army units there. This change is to be\r\n    explained by movements into training camps, regroupings.\r\n\r\n    “2. The impression is to be created that the center of the\r\n    massing of troops is in the Southern part of the Gouvernement,\r\n    in the Protekterat and in Austria, and that the massing in the\r\n    North is relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n    “3. When it comes to the equipment situation of the units,\r\n    especially of the armored divisions, things are to be\r\n    exaggerated, if necessary.\r\n\r\n    “4. By suitable news the impression to be created that the\r\n    _antiaircraft protection_ in the East has been increased\r\n    considerably after the end of the campaign in the West and that\r\n    it continues to be increased with captured French material on\r\n    all important targets.\r\n\r\n    “5. Concerning improvements on _railroads_, _roads_,\r\n    _airdromes_, _etc._, it is to be stated that the work is kept\r\n    within normal limits, is needed for the improvement of the newly\r\n    won Eastern territories, and serves primarily economical\r\n    traffic.\r\n\r\n    “The supreme command of the Army (OKH) decides to what extent\r\n    correct details, i.e., numbers of regiments, manning of\r\n    garrisons, etc., will be made available to the defense for\r\n    purposes of counter espionage.\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces,\r\n\r\n     By order of\r\n                                       /signed/  Jodl.” (_1229-PS_)\r\n\r\nEarly in November 1940 Hitler reiterated his previous orders and called\r\nfor a continuation of preparations, promising further and more definite\r\ninstructions as soon as this preliminary work produced a general outline\r\nof the army’s operational plans. This order was contained in a Top\r\nSecret directive from the Fuehrer’s Headquarters No. 18, dated 12\r\nNovember 1940, signed by Hitler and initialed by Jodl (_444-PS_). The\r\ndirective begins by saying that:\r\n\r\n    “The preparatory measures of Supreme Headquarters for the\r\n    prosecution of the war in the near future are to be made along\r\n    the following lines.” (_444-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt then outlines plans for the various theaters and the policy regarding\r\nrelations with other countries and says regarding the U.S.S.R.:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 5. _Russia_\r\n\r\n    “Political discussions have been initiated with the aim of\r\n    clarifying Russia’s attitude for the time being. Irrespective of\r\n    the results of these discussions, all preparations for the East\r\n    which have already been verbally ordered will be continued.\r\n\r\n    “Instructions on this will follow, as soon as the general\r\n    outline of the Army’s operational plans has been submitted to,\r\n    and approved by me.” (_444-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 5 December 1940 the Chief of the General Staff of the Army, at that\r\ntime General Halder, reported to the Fuehrer concerning the progress of\r\nthe plans for the coming operation against the U.S.S.R. A report of this\r\nconference with Hitler is set forth in a folder containing many\r\ndocuments, all labelled annexes and all bearing on _Fall Barbarossa_\r\n(_1799-PS_). This folder was discovered with the War Diary of the\r\n_Wehrmacht Fuehrungsstab_ and was apparently an inclosure to that Diary.\r\nAnnex No. 1, dated 5 December 1940, indicates the state which planning\r\nfor this aggression had reached six and a half months before it\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n    “Report to the Fuehrer on 5 December 1940.\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of the General Staff of the Army then reports about\r\n    the planned operation in the East. He expanded at first on the\r\n    geographic fundamentals. The main war industrial centers are in\r\n    the Ukraine, in Moscow and in Leningrad.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer declares that he is agreed with the discussed\r\n    operational plans and adds the following: The most important\r\n    goal is to prevent that the Russians should withdraw on a closed\r\n    front. The eastward advance should be combined until the Russian\r\n    air force will be unable to attack the territory of the German\r\n    Reich and, on the other hand, the German air force will be\r\n    enabled to conduct raids to destroy Russian war industrial\r\n    territories. In this way we should be able to achieve the\r\n    annihilation of the Russian army and to prevent its\r\n    regeneration.\r\n\r\n    “The first commitment of the forces should take place in such a\r\n    way to make the annihilation of strong enemy units possible.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It is essential that the Russians should not take up positions\r\n    in the rear again. The number of 130-140 Divisions as planned\r\n    for the entire operation is sufficient.” (_1799-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Plan Barbarossa._\r\n\r\nBy 18 December 1940 the general outline of the army’s operational plans\r\nhaving been submitted to Hitler, the basic strategical directive to the\r\nHigh Commands of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces for\r\n_Barbarossa_—Directive No. 21—was issued (_446-PS_). This directive\r\nmarks the first time the plan to invade the U.S.S.R. was specifically\r\nreferred to in an order, although the order was classified Top Secret.\r\nIt also marked the first use of the code word _Barbarossa_ to denote the\r\noperation against the Soviet Union. One of the most significant passages\r\nin that directive is the opening sentence:\r\n\r\n    “The German Armed Forces must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia\r\n    in a quick campaign even before the end of the war against\r\n    England. (Case Barbarossa).” (_446-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe directive continues:\r\n\r\n    “Preparations requiring more time to start are—if this has not\r\n    yet been done—to begin presently and are to be completed not\r\n    later than 15 May 1941.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Great caution has to be exercised that the intention of an\r\n    attack will not be recognized.” (_446-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe directive then outlined the broad strategy on which the intended\r\ninvasion was to proceed and the parts which the Army, Navy, and Air\r\nForces were to play therein, and called for oral reports to Hitler by\r\nthe Commanders-in-Chief. The directive concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “V. I am expecting the reports of the Commanders-in-Chief on\r\n    their further plans based on this letter of instructions.\r\n\r\n    “The preparations planned by all branches of the Armed Forces\r\n    are to be reported to me through the High Command, also in\r\n    regard to their time.” (_446-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe directive is signed by Hitler and initialled by Jodl, Keitel,\r\nWarlimont, and one illegible signature.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly clear both from the contents of the order itself as well\r\nas from its history, which has been outlined, that this directive was no\r\nmere staff planning exercise. It was an order to prepare for an act of\r\naggression which was intended to occur and which actually did occur. The\r\nvarious services which received the order understood it as an order to\r\nprepare for action and did not view it as a hypothetical staff problem.\r\nThis is plain from the detailed planning and preparation which they\r\nimmediately undertook in order to implement the general scheme set forth\r\nin the basic directive.\r\n\r\nC. _Military Planning and Preparation for the Implementation of\r\nBarbarossa._\r\n\r\nThe Naval War Diary for 30 January 1941 indicates the early compliance\r\nof the OKM with that part of Directive No. 21 (_446-PS_) which ordered\r\nprogress in preparation to be reported to Hitler through the High\r\nCommand of the Armed Forces. This entry in the War Diary contains a\r\nsubstantial amount of technical information concerning the Navy’s part\r\nin the coming campaign and the manner in which it was preparing itself\r\nto play that part (_C-35_). The following passage shows that the Navy\r\nwas actively preparing for the attack at this early date:\r\n\r\n    “_30 January 1941_\r\n\r\n    7. Talk by Ia about the plans and preparations for the\r\n    “Barbarossa” case to be submitted to the High Command of the\r\n    Armed Forces”. (_C-35_)\r\n\r\n”Ia” is, in this case, the abbreviation for a deputy head of the\r\nOperations Division of the Naval War Staff.) Then follows a list of the\r\nNavy’s objectives in the war against Russia. Under the latter, many\r\ntasks for the Navy are listed, one of which is sufficiently typical to\r\ngive an idea of all:\r\n\r\n    “II. _Objectives of War Against Russia._\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    _d._ To harass the Russian fleet by surprise blows as:\r\n\r\n    “1. Lightning-like commitments at the outbreak of the war of air\r\n    force units against strong points and combat vessels in the\r\n    Baltic, Black Sea, and Ice Sea.” (_C-35_)\r\n\r\nThis document indicates the detailed thinking and planning which was\r\nbeing carried out to implement _Barbarossa_ almost six months before the\r\noperation actually got underway. It is but another piece in the mosaic\r\nof evidence which demonstrates beyond question of doubt that the\r\ninvasion of the Soviet Union was undeniably a premeditated attack.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Naval War Diary for the month of February contains at\r\nleast several references to the planning and preparation for the coming\r\ncampaign (_C-33_). The entry for 19 February 1941 is typical:\r\n\r\n    “In regard to the impending operation ‘Barbarossa’ for which all\r\n    S-Boats in the Baltic will be needed, a transfer of some can\r\n    only be considered after conclusion of the Barbarossa\r\n    operations.” (_C-33_)\r\n\r\nOn 3 February 1941 the Fuehrer held a conference to assess the progress\r\nthus far made in the planning for _Barbarossa_. The conference also\r\ndiscussed the plans for _Sonnenblume_, which was the code name for the\r\nNorth African Operation. Attending this conference were, in addition to\r\nHitler, the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, Keitel;\r\nthe Chief of the Armed Forces Operations Staff, Jodl; the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army, von Brauchitsch; the Chief of the Army\r\nGeneral Staff, Halder; as well as several others including, Colonel\r\nSchmundt, Hitler’s Adjutant (_872-PS_). During the course of this\r\nconference, the Chief of the Army General Staff gave a long report about\r\nenemy strength as compared with German strength, and about the general\r\noverall operational plans for the invasion. This report was punctuated\r\nat various intervals by comments from the Fuehrer. An extract from this\r\nreport, although written in a semishorthand form, is at least\r\nsufficiently clear to disclose that elaborate timetables had already\r\nbeen set up for the deployment of troops, as well as for industrial\r\noperations:\r\n\r\n    “_The intended time period_ was discussed with a plan.\r\n\r\n        1st Deployment Staffel (_Aufmarschstaffel_)\r\n\r\n        2nd      “         “            “\r\n\r\n    transfer now, Front—Germany—East from the middle of March will\r\n    give up 3 divisions for reinforcement in the West. Army groups\r\n    and Army High Commands are being withdrawn from the West. There\r\n    are already considerable reinforcements though still in the rear\r\n    area. From now on, Attila [the code word for the operation for\r\n    the occupation of unoccupied France] can be carried out only\r\n    under difficulties. Industrial traffic is hampered by transport\r\n    movements. From the middle of April, Hungary will be approached\r\n    about the march through. Three deployment staffels from the\r\n    middle of April. Felix is now no longer possible as the main\r\n    part of the artillery is being entrained. [Felix is the code\r\n    word for the occupation of Canary Islands, North Africa and\r\n    Gibraltar.]\r\n\r\n    “_In industry_ the full capacity timetable is in force. No more\r\n    camouflage.\r\n\r\n    “From 25.IV-15.V, 4 staffels to withdraw considerable forces\r\n    from the West. (Seeloewe [Seeloewe was the code word for the\r\n    planned operation against England] can no longer be carried\r\n    out). The strategic concentration in the East is quite\r\n    recognizable.\r\n\r\n    “The full capacity timetable remains. 8 Marita [Marita was the\r\n    code word for the action against Greece] divisions complete the\r\n    picture of the disposition of forces on the plan.\r\n\r\n    “_C-in-C Army_ requested that he no longer have to employ 5\r\n    control divisions for this, but might hold them ready as\r\n    reserves for commanders in the West.\r\n\r\n    “_Fuehrer_ When Barbarossa commences, the world will hold its\r\n    breath and make no comment.” (_872-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis much, when read with the conference conclusions, is sufficient to\r\nshow that the Army as well as the Navy regarded _Barbarossa_ as an\r\naction directive and were far along with their preparations even as\r\nearly as February 1941—almost five months prior to 22 June, the date\r\nwhen the attack was actually launched. The conference report summarized\r\nthe conclusions of the conference, insofar as they affected\r\n_Barbarossa_, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Conclusions_:\r\n\r\n    “1. _Barbarossa_\r\n\r\n        “_a._ The Fuehrer on the whole was in agreement with the\r\n        operational plan. When it is being carried out, it must\r\n        be remembered that the _main aim_ is to gain possession\r\n        of the Baltic States and Leningrad.\r\n\r\n        “_b._ The Fuehrer desires that the operation map and the\r\n        plan of the disposition of forces be sent to him as soon\r\n        as possible.\r\n\r\n        “_c._ Agreements with neighbouring states, who are\r\n        taking part, may not be concluded until there is no\r\n        longer any necessity for camouflage. The exception is\r\n        Roumania with regard to the reinforcing of the Moldaw.\r\n\r\n        “_d._ It must, at all costs, be possible to carry out\r\n        Attila (auxiliary measure).\r\n\r\n        “_e._ The strategic concentration for Barbarossa will be\r\n        camouflaged as a feint for Seeloewe and the subsidiary\r\n        measure Marita.” (_872-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs the plans for the invasion became more detailed, involved, and\r\ncomplete, more and more agencies outside the Armed Forces had to be\r\nbrought into the picture, let in on the secret, and assigned their\r\nrespective parts. For example, early in March, 1941, Keitel drafted a\r\nletter to be sent to Reich Minister Todt, then Reich Minister of\r\nArmaments and Munitions and head of the organization Todt. In this\r\nletter Keitel explained the principles on which the camouflage for the\r\noperation was based and requested that the organization Todt follow the\r\nsame line (_874-PS_). This letter illustrates the elaborate deceit with\r\nwhich the Nazi conspirators sought to hide the preparations for their\r\ntreacherous attack:\r\n\r\n                             “_Top Secret_\r\n              “The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.\r\n                                      “Hq. of the Fuehrer 9 March 41\r\n                                                           DRAFT\r\n\r\n    “Honorable Reich Minister! (TODT)\r\n\r\n    “For the missions which the Fuehrer has assigned to the Armed\r\n    Forces in the East, extensive measures for the diversion and\r\n    deception of friend and foe are necessary prerequisites for the\r\n    success of the operations.\r\n\r\n    “The Supreme Command of the Armed Forces has issued guiding\r\n    rules for the deception in accordance with more detailed\r\n    directives of the Fuehrer. These rules aim essentially at\r\n    continuing preparations for the attack against England in an\r\n    increasing degree. Simultaneously the actual preparations for\r\n    deployment in the East should be represented as a diversionary\r\n    maneuvre to divert from plans which are being pursued for an\r\n    attack against England. In order to insure success for these\r\n    measures, it is indispensable that these same principles are\r\n    being also followed on the part of the Organization Todt.\r\n\r\n                                  “K. J. W.”\r\n                                  [Initials of\r\n                                  Keitel, Jodl and Warlimont] (_874-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 13 March 1941 Keitel signed an operational supplement to Fuehrer\r\nOrder #21 (_446-PS_), which was issued in the form of “Directives for\r\nSpecial Areas” (_447-PS_). This detailed operational order, which was\r\nissued more than three months in advance of the attack, indicates how\r\ncomplete were the plans on practically every phase of the operation.\r\nSection I of the directive is headed “Area of Operations and Executive\r\nPower” and outlines who was to be in control of what and where. It\r\nstates that while the campaign is in progress, the Supreme Commander of\r\nthe Army has the executive power in territory through which the army is\r\nadvancing. During this period, however, the Reichsfuehrer SS is\r\nentrusted with “special tasks.” This assignment is discussed in\r\nparagraph 2b:\r\n\r\n    “* * * _b._ In the area of operations, the _Reichsfuehrer SS_\r\n    is, on behalf of the Fuehrer, entrusted with _special tasks_ for\r\n    the preparation of the _political administration_, tasks which\r\n    result from the struggle which has to be carried out between two\r\n    opposing political systems. Within the realm of these tasks, the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS shall act independently and under his own\r\n    responsibility. The executive power invested in the Supreme\r\n    Commander of the Army (OKH) and in agencies determined by him\r\n    shall not be affected by this. It is the responsibility of the\r\n    Reichsfuehrer SS that through the execution of his tasks\r\n    military operations shall not be disturbed. Details shall be\r\n    arranged directly through the OKH with the Reichsfuehrer SS.”\r\n    (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe order then states that, in time, political administration will be\r\nset up under Commissioners of the Reich. The relationship of these\r\nofficials to the army is discussed in paragraphs 2c and 3:\r\n\r\n    “_c._ As soon as the area of operations has reached sufficient\r\n    depth, it is to be _limited in the rear_. The newly occupied\r\n    territory in the rear of the area of operations is to be given\r\n    its own _political_ administration. For the present, it is to be\r\n    divided, according to its genealogic basis and to the positions\r\n    of the Army Groups, into _North_ (_Baltic countries_), _Center_\r\n    (_White Russia_) _and South_ (_Ukraine_). In these territories\r\n    _the political administration is taken care of by Commissioners\r\n    of the Reich_ who receive their orders from the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “3. For the execution of all _military tasks_ within the areas\r\n    under political administration in the rear of the area of\r\n    operations, _commanding officers_ who are responsible to the\r\n    Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces (OKW) shall be in command.\r\n\r\n    “The commanding officer is the _supreme representative of the\r\n    Armed Forces_ in the respective areas and the bearer of the\r\n    _military sovereign rights_. He has _the tasks of a Territorial\r\n    Commander_ and the rights of a supreme Army Commander or a\r\n    Commanding General. In this capacity he is responsible primarily\r\n    for the following tasks.\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Close cooperation with the Commissioner of the Reich in\r\n    order to support him in his political task.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Exploitation of the country and securing its economic\r\n    values for use by German industry (see par. 4). (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe directive also outlines the responsibility for the administration of\r\neconomy in the conquered territory. This provision is also contained in\r\nSection I, paragraph 4:\r\n\r\n    “4. The Fuehrer has entrusted the uniform direction of _the\r\n    administration of economy_ in the area of operations and in the\r\n    territories of political administration to the Reich Marshal who\r\n    has delegated the Chief of the ‘Wi Rue Amt’ with the execution\r\n    of the task. Special orders on that will come from the\r\n    OKW/Wi/Rue/Amt.” (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe second section deals with matters of personnel, supply, and\r\ncommunication traffic. Section III of the order deals with the relations\r\nwith certain other countries and states, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “III. _Regulations regarding Rumania, Slovakia, Hungary and\r\n    Finland._\r\n\r\n    9. The necessary arrangements with these countries shall be made\r\n    by the OKW, together with the Foreign Office, and according to\r\n    the wishes of the respective high commands. In case it should\r\n    become necessary during the course of the operations to grant\r\n    special rights, applications for this purpose are to be\r\n    submitted to the OKW.” (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe document closes with a section regarding Sweden:\r\n\r\n    “IV. _Directives regarding Sweden._\r\n\r\n    12. Since Sweden can only become a transient-area for troops, no\r\n    special authority is to be granted the commander of the German\r\n    troops. However, he is entitled and compelled to secure the\r\n    immediate protection of RR-transports against sabotage and\r\n    attacks.\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n\r\n                                                 “signed:  KEITEL”\r\n                                                         (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs was hinted in the original Barbarossa Order, Directive No. 21\r\n(_446-PS_), the plan originally contemplated that the attack would take\r\nplace about the 15th of May 1941. In the meantime, however, the Nazi\r\nconspirators found themselves involved in a campaign in the Balkans and\r\nwere forced to delay Barbarossa for a few weeks. Evidence of this\r\npostponement is found in a document (_C-170_) which has been identified\r\nby Raeder as a compilation of official extracts from the Naval War Staff\r\nWar Diary. It was prepared by naval archivists who had access to the\r\nAdmiralty files and contains file references to the papers which were\r\nthe basis for each entry. This item dated 3 April 1941 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Balkan Operations delayed ‘Barbarossa’ at first for about five\r\n    weeks._ All measures which can be construed as _offensive\r\n    actions_ are to be stopped according to Fuehrer order.”\r\n    (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nBy the end of April, however, things were sufficiently straightened out\r\nto permit the Fuehrer definitely to set D-Day as 22 June—more than\r\nseven weeks away. A “Top Secret” report of a conference with the Chief\r\nof the Section _Landsverteidigung_ of the _Wehrmachtfuhrungsstab_ on 30\r\nApril 1941 states, in the first two paragraphs:\r\n\r\n    “1. _Timetable Barbarossa_:\r\n\r\n    The Fuehrer has decided:\r\n\r\n    _Action Barbarossa_ begins on 22 June. From 23 May maximal troop\r\n    movements performance schedule. At the beginning of operations\r\n    the OKH reserves will have not yet reached the appointed areas.\r\n\r\n    “2. _Proportion of actual strength in the plan Barbarossa:\r\n    Sector North_: German and Russian forces approximately of the\r\n    same strength.\r\n\r\n    _Sector Middle_: Great German superiority.\r\n\r\n    _Sector South_: Russian superiority.” (_873-PS_)\r\n\r\nEarly in June, approximately three weeks before D-Day, preparations for\r\nthe attack were so complete that it was possible for the High Command to\r\nissue an elaborate timetable showing in great detail the disposition and\r\nmissions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This timetable (_C-39_) was\r\nprepared in 21 copies. The copy reproduced here was the third copy,\r\nwhich was given to the High Command of the Navy. Page 1 is in the form\r\nof a transmittal and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n                         “_Top Military Secret_\r\n    “Supreme Command of the Armed Forces\r\n    Nr. 44842/41 Top Military Secret WFST/Abt.L (I op)\r\n                                            “Fuehrer’s Headquarters\r\n                                                        (no date)\r\n    “Top Secret (_Chefsache_)\r\n    _Only through officer_\r\n\r\n                                                   “_21 copies_\r\n                                                      3rd copy Ob. d. m.\r\n                                                      I op.00845/41\r\n                                                      Received 6 June\r\n                                                      Enclosures:—\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has authorized the appended timetable as a\r\n    foundation for further preparations for ‘Barbarossa’.

The outline is in six paragraphs covering the status on that\r\ndate under six headings: General; Negotiations with Friendly States;\r\nArmy; Navy; Air Force, and Camouflage. The remainder of the document is\r\nin tabular form with six columns headed from left to right at the top of\r\neach page—Date; Serial No.; Army; Navy; OKW; Remarks. The item\r\nappearing under date 21 June and Serial No. 29, provides in the columns\r\nfor Army, Navy, and Air Forces that, “Till 1300 hours latest time at\r\nwhich operation can be cancelled (_spaetester Anhaltetermin_)” (_C-39_).\r\nUnder the column headed OKW appears the note: “Cancelled by code word\r\n‘Altona’ or further confirmation of start of attack by code word:\r\n‘Dortmund’” (_C-39_). In the Remarks column appears the statement that:\r\n“Complete absence of camouflage of formation of Army point of main\r\neffort (_Schwerpunkt_), concentration of armour and artillery must be\r\nreckoned with” (_C-39_). The entry for 22 June, under serial number 31,\r\ngives a notation which cuts across the columns for the Army, Air Force,\r\nNavy, and OKW and provides as follows:\r\n\r\n                            “_Invasion Day_\r\n\r\n    “H-hour for the start of the invasion by the Army and crossing\r\n    of the frontier by the Air Forces. 0330 hours”. (_C-39_)\r\n\r\nIn the Remarks column it is stated that:\r\n\r\n    “Army assembly independent of any lateness in starting owing to\r\n    weather on the part of the Air Force.” (_C-39_)\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the chart are similar in nature to those quoted and\r\ngive great detail concerning the disposition and missions of the various\r\ncomponents of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nOn 9 June 1941 the order of the Fuehrer went out for final reports on\r\nBarbarossa to be made in Berlin on 14 June 1941—8 days before “D-Day”\r\n(_C-78_). This order, signed by Hitler’s Adjutant, Schmundt, reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                              “TOP SECRET\r\n                            Only by Officer\r\n    “Office of Wehrmacht Adjutant\r\n                                                “at Berchtesgaden\r\n                                                       9th June 1941\r\n\r\n    “_To the Fuehrer_\r\n\r\n    Br.

The list includes a large number of the members of the High\r\nCommand and General Staff Group as of that date. Among those to\r\nparticipate were Goering, Keitel, Jodl, and Raeder.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing documents are sufficient to establish the premeditation\r\nand calculation which marked the military preparations for the invasion\r\nof the U.S.S.R. Starting almost a full year before the launching of the\r\nattack, the Nazi conspirators planned and prepared every military detail\r\nof their aggression against the Soviet Union with all that thoroughness\r\nand meticulousness which has come to be associated with the German\r\ncharacter. The leading roles were performed in this preparation by the\r\nmilitary figures—Goering, Keitel, Jodl, and Raeder.\r\n\r\nD. _Plans for the Economic Exploitation and Spoliation of the U.S.S.R._\r\n\r\nNot only was there detailed preparation for the invasion from a purely\r\nmilitary standpoint, but equally elaborate and detailed planning was\r\nundertaken by the Nazi conspirators to insure that their aggression\r\nwould prove economically profitable. The motives which led the\r\nconspirators to plan and launch attack were both political and economic.\r\nThe economic basis may be simply summarized as the greed of the Nazi\r\nconspirators for the raw material, food, and other supplies which their\r\nneighbor possessed and which they conceived of themselves as needing for\r\nthe maintenance of their war machine. To the Nazi conspirators a need\r\nwas translated as a right, and they early began planning and preparing\r\nwith typical care and detail to insure that every bit of the plunder\r\nwhich it would be possible to reap in the course of their aggression\r\nwould be exploited to their utmost benefit.\r\n\r\nAs early as August 1940 General Thomas, Chief of the _Wi Rue Amt_,\r\nreceived a hint from Goering about a possible attack on the U.S.S.R.,\r\nwhich prompted him to begin considering the Soviet war economy. In\r\nNovember 1940—8 months before the attack—Thomas was categorically\r\ninformed by Goering of the planned operation in the East, and\r\npreliminary preparations were commenced for the economic plundering of\r\nthe territories to be occupied in the course of such operation\r\n(_2353-PS_). Goering played the overall leading role in this activity by\r\nvirtue of his position at the head of the Four Year Plan. Thomas\r\ndescribes his receipt of the knowledge and this early planning in these\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In November, 1940, the Chief of the _Wi Rue_ together\r\n    with Secretaries of state Koerner, Neumann, Backe and General\r\n    von Hanneken were informed by the Reichmarshal of the action\r\n    planned in the East.\r\n\r\n    “By reason of these directives the preliminary preparations for\r\n    the action in the East were commenced by the office of Wi Rue at\r\n    the end of 1940.\r\n\r\n    “The preliminary preparations for the action in the East\r\n    included first of all the following tasks:\r\n\r\n    “1. Obtaining of a detailed survey of the Russian Armament\r\n    industry, its location, its capacity and its associate\r\n    industries.\r\n\r\n    “2. Investigation of the capacity of the different big armament\r\n    centers and their dependency one on the other.\r\n\r\n    “3. Determine the power and transport system for the industry of\r\n    the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n    “4. Investigation of sources of raw materials and petroleum\r\n    (crude oil).\r\n\r\n    “5. Preparation of a survey of industries other than armament\r\n    industries in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n    “These points were concentrated in one big compilation ‘War\r\n    Economy of the Soviet Union’ and illustrated with detailed maps,\r\n    etc.”\r\n\r\n    “Furthermore a card index was made, containing all the important\r\n    factories in Soviet-Russia, and a lexicon of economy in the\r\n    German-Russian language for the use of the German War Economy\r\n    Organization.\r\n\r\n    “For the processing of these problems a task staff, Russia, was\r\n    created, first in charge of Lieutenant Colonel Luther and later\r\n    on in charge of Brigadier General Schubert. The work was carried\r\n    out according to the directives from the Chief of the Office,\r\n    resp. the group of depts. for foreign territories (Ausland) with\r\n    the cooperation of all departments, economy offices and any\r\n    other persons, possessing information on Russia. Through these\r\n    intensive preparative activities an excellent collection of\r\n    material was made, which proved of the utmost value later on for\r\n    carrying out the operations and for administering the\r\n    territory.” (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy the end of February 1941 this preliminary planning had proceeded to a\r\npoint where a broader plan of organization was needed. General Thomas\r\nheld a conference, with his subordinates on 28 February 1941 to call for\r\nsuch a plan. A memorandum of this conference classified Top Secret and\r\ndated 1 March 1941, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The general ordered that a broader plan of organization be\r\n    drafted for the Reich Marshal.\r\n\r\n    “Essential Points:\r\n\r\n    “1. The whole organization to be subordinate to the Reich\r\n    Marshal. _Purpose_: Support and extension of the measures of the\r\n    four-year plan.\r\n\r\n    “2. The organization must include everything concerning war\r\n    economy, excepting only food, which is said to be made already a\r\n    special mission of State Secretary Backe.\r\n\r\n    “3. Clear statement that _the organization is to be independent\r\n    of the military or civil administration_. Close cooperation, but\r\n    instructions direct from the central office in Berlin.\r\n\r\n    “4. Scope of activities to be divided in two steps:\r\n\r\n    _a._ Accompanying the advancing troops directly behind the front\r\n    lines, in order to avoid the destruction of supplies and to\r\n    secure the removal of important goods.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Administration of the occupied industrial districts and\r\n    exploitation of economically complimentary districts.\r\n\r\n    “5. In view of the extended field of activity, the term _war\r\n    economy_ inspection is to be used preferably, instead of\r\n    armament inspection.\r\n\r\n    “6. In view of the great field of activity, the organization\r\n    must be generously equipped and personnel must be\r\n    correspondingly numerous. _The main mission of the organization_\r\n    will consist of _seizing raw materials and taking over all_\r\n    _important concerns_. For the latter mission reliable persons\r\n    from German concerns will be interposed suitably from the\r\n    beginning, since successful operation from the beginning can\r\n    only be performed by the aid of their experiences, (for example,\r\n    lignite, ore, chemistry, petroleum).\r\n\r\n    “After the discussion of further details, Lt. Col. Luther was\r\n    instructed to make an initial draft of such an organization\r\n    within one week.\r\n\r\n    “Close cooperation with the individual sections in the building\r\n    is essential. An officer must still be appointed for Wi and Rue,\r\n    with whom the operational staff can remain in constant contact.\r\n    Wi is to give each section chief and Lt. Col. Luther a copy of\r\n    the new plan regarding Russia.\r\n\r\n    “Major General Schubert is to be asked to be in Berlin the\r\n    second half of next week. Also, the four officers who are\r\n    ordered to draw up the individual armament inspections are to\r\n    report to the Office Chief at the end of next week.\r\n\r\n                                               “(signed:) Hamann”.\r\n                                                        (_1317-PS_)\r\n\r\nHamann, who signed the report is listed among those attending as a\r\nCaptain, was apparently the junior officer present. Presumably it fell\r\nnaturally to his lot to prepare the minutes of the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe authority and mission of this organization which Thomas was\r\norganizing at the direction of Goering was clearly recognized by Keitel\r\nin his operational order of 13 March 1941 (_447-PS_). The order stated\r\nthat the Fuehrer had entrusted the uniform direction of the\r\nadministration of economy in the area of operations and political\r\nadministration to the Reichsmarshal (Goering) who in turn had delegated\r\nhis authority to the Chief of the _Wi Rue Amt_ (Thomas). (_447-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe organizational work called for by General Thomas at the meeting on\r\n28 February apparently proceeded apace, and on 29 April 1941 a\r\nconference was held with various branches of the Armed Forces to explain\r\nthe organizational set-up of Economic Staff _Oldenburg_. (_Oldenburg_\r\nwas the code name given to this economic counterpart of _Barbarossa_.)\r\nSection I of the report of this conference (_1157-PS_) deals with the\r\ngeneral organization of Economic Staff _Oldenburg_ as it had developed.\r\nThe report begins:\r\n\r\n“_Conference with the Branches of the Armed Forces at 1000 hours on 29th\r\n                              April 1941_\r\n                                   I.\r\n                               _Welcome_\r\n\r\n    “Purpose of meeting: introduction to the organizational\r\n    structure of the economic sector of the action.\r\n\r\n                        “_Barbarossa—Oldenburg_\r\n\r\n    “As already known, the Fuehrer, contrary to previous procedure,\r\n    has ordered for this drive the uniform concentration in one hand\r\n    of _all_ economic operations and has entrusted the Reich Marshal\r\n    with the overall direction of the economic administration in the\r\n    area of operations and in the areas under political\r\n    administration.\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Marshal has delegated this function to an economic\r\n    general staff, working under the director of the industrial\r\n    armament office (_Chef Wi Rue Amt_).\r\n\r\n    “Under the Reich Marshal and the economic general staff, the\r\n    supreme central authority in the area of the drive itself is the\r\n    _Economic Staff Oldenburg for special duties_ under the command\r\n    of Major General (Generalleutnant) Schubert.\r\n\r\n    “His subordinate authorities, geographically subdivided are:\r\n\r\n        5 economic inspectorates\r\n\r\n        23 economic commands\r\n\r\n        12 sub-offices, which are distributed among important\r\n        places within the area of the economic commands.\r\n\r\n    “These offices are used in the _military rear area_; the idea is\r\n    that in the territory of each Army Group an economic\r\n    inspectorate is to be established at the seat of the commander\r\n    of the military rear area, and that this inspectorate will\r\n    supervise the economic exploitation of the territory.\r\n\r\n    “A distinction must be made between the military rear area on\r\n    the one hand and the battle area proper and the rear area of the\r\n    army on the other hand. In the last economic matters are dealt\r\n    with by the IV Econ (IV Wi) of the Army Headquarters Commands,\r\n    i.e. the liaison officer of the industrial armament office\r\n    within the supreme command of the armed forces at the army\r\n    headquarters commands. For the battle area he has attached to\r\n    him: technical battalions, reconnaissance and recovery troops\r\n    for raw materials, mineral oil, agricultural machinery, in\r\n    particular tractors and means of production.\r\n\r\n    “In the territory between the battle and the military rear area,\r\n    the rear area of the Army, group IV Econs at the various field\r\n    commands are placed at the disposal of the liaison officer of\r\n    the industrial armaments office in order to support the army\r\n    headquarters commands specialists responsible for supplying the\r\n    troops from the country’s resources and for preparing the\r\n    subsequent general economic exploitation.\r\n\r\n    “While these units move with the troops, economic inspectorates,\r\n    economic commands and their sub-offices remain established in\r\n    the locality.\r\n\r\n    “The new feature inherent in the organization under the command\r\n    of the Economic Staff _Oldenburg_ is that it does not only deal\r\n    with military industry, but comprises the _entire_ economic\r\n    field. Consequently, all offices are no longer to be designated\r\n    as offices of the military industries or armaments, but quite\r\n    generally as economic inspectorates, economic commands, etc.\r\n\r\n    “This also corresponds with the internal organization of the\r\n    individual offices which, from the Economic Staff _Oldenburg_\r\n    down to the economic commands, requires a standard subdivision\r\n    into three large groups, i.e.\r\n\r\n    “_Group H_ dealing with troop requirements, armaments,\r\n    industrial transport organization.\r\n\r\n    “_Group L_ which concerns itself with all questions of feed and\r\n    agriculture, and\r\n\r\n    “_Group W_ which is in charge of the entire field of trade and\r\n    industry, including raw materials and suppliers; further\r\n    questions of forestry, finance and banking, enemy property,\r\n    commerce and exchange of commodities and manpower allocation.\r\n\r\n    “Secretary of State Backe is appointed Commissioner for Food and\r\n    Agriculture in the General Staff; the problems falling within\r\n    the field of activities of Group W are dealt with by General v.\r\n    Hanneken.” (_1157-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the document deals with local subdivisions, personnel\r\nand staffing problems, and similar details.\r\n\r\nThese documents portray the calculated method with which the Nazi\r\nconspirators prepared months in advance to rob and loot their intended\r\nvictim. They show that the conspirators not only planned to stage an\r\nattack on a neighbor they had pledged to security, but that they also\r\nintended to strip that neighbor of its food, its factories, and all its\r\nmeans of livelihood. The Nazi conspirators made these plans for plunder\r\nbeing fully aware that to carry them out would necessarily involve ruin\r\nand starvation for millions of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. (The\r\nstory of how this plot was executed forms a part of the case to be\r\npresented by the Soviet prosecuting staff.)\r\n\r\nE. _Preparation for the Political Phase of the Aggression._\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated, and as will be later more fully\r\ndeveloped, there were both economic and political motives for the action\r\nof the Nazi conspirators in invading the Soviet Union. The economic\r\naspects have been discussed. Equally elaborate planning was engaged in\r\nby the Nazi conspirators to insure the effectuation of the political aim\r\nof their aggression. That political aim may be described as the\r\nelimination of the U.S.S.R. as a powerful political factor in Europe,\r\nand the acquisition of _Lebensraum_. For the accomplishment of these\r\npurposes the Nazi conspirators selected as their agent Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nAs early as 2 April 1941 Rosenberg, or a member of his staff, prepared a\r\nmemorandum on the U.S.S.R. (_1017-PS_). This memorandum speculates on\r\nthe possibility of a disagreement with the U.S.S.R. which would result\r\nin a quick occupation of an important part of that country. The\r\nmemorandum then considers what the political goal of such occupation\r\nshould be and suggests ways for reaching such a goal. This memorandum\r\nbegins:\r\n\r\n    “_Subject: The U.S.S.R._\r\n\r\n    “Bolshevik Russia, just as the one-time Czarist Russia, is a\r\n    conglomeration of peoples of very different types, which has\r\n    come into being through the annexation of states of a related or\r\n    even of an essentially alien character.\r\n\r\n    “A military conflict with the U.S.S.R. will result in an\r\n    extraordinarily rapid occupation of an important and large\r\n    section of the U.S.S.R. It is very probable that military action\r\n    on our part will very soon be followed by the military collapse\r\n    of the U.S.S.R. The occupation of these areas would then present\r\n    not so many military as administrative and economic\r\n    difficulties. Thus arises the first question:\r\n\r\n    “Is the occupation to be determined by purely military and/or\r\n    economic needs, or is the laying of political foundations for a\r\n    future organization of the area also a factor in determining how\r\n    far the occupation shall be extended? If so, it is a matter of\r\n    urgency to fix the _political_ goal which is to be attained, for\r\n    it will, without doubt, also have an effect on military\r\n    operations.\r\n\r\n    “If the Political overthrow of the Eastern Empire, in the weak\r\n    condition it would be at the time, is set as the goal of\r\n    military operations, one may conclude that:\r\n\r\n    “1. The occupation must comprise areas of vast proportions;\r\n\r\n    “2. From the very beginning, the treatment of individual\r\n    sections of territory should, as regards administration, as well\r\n    as economics and ideology, be adapted to the political ends we\r\n    are striving to attain;\r\n\r\n    “3. Again, extraordinary questions concerning these vast areas,\r\n    such as, in particular, the ensuring of essential supplies for\r\n    the continuation of the war against England, the maintenance of\r\n    production which this necessitates and the great directives for\r\n    the completely separate areas, should best be dealt with all\r\n    together in one place.\r\n\r\n    “It should again be stressed here that, in addition, all the\r\n    arguments which follow of course only hold good once the\r\n    supplies from the area to be occupied which are essential to\r\n    Greater Germany for the continuance of the war, have been\r\n    assured.\r\n\r\n    “Anyone who knows the East, sees in a map of Russia’s population\r\n    the following national or geographical units:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Greater Russia with Moscow as its centre.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ White Russia with Minsk or Smolensk as its capital.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\r\n\r\n    “_d._ The Ukraine and the Crimea with Kiev as its centre.\r\n\r\n    “_e._ The Don area with Rostov as its capital.\r\n\r\n    “_f._ The area of the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n    “_g._ Russian Central Asia or Russian Turkestan.” (_1017-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe memorandum then proceeds to discuss each of the areas or\r\ngeographical units thus listed in some detail. At the end of the paper\r\nthe writer sums up his thoughts and briefly outlines his plan in these\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n    “_Summary_\r\n\r\n    “The following systematic constructional plan is evolved from\r\n    the points briefly outlined here:\r\n\r\n    “1. The creation of a central department for the occupied areas\r\n    of the U.S.S.R., to be confined more or less to wartime.\r\n\r\n    “Working in agreement with the higher and supreme Reich\r\n    authorities, it would be the task of this department—\r\n\r\n    “_a._ To issue binding political instructions to the separate\r\n    administration area, having in mind the situation existing at\r\n    the time and the goal which is to be achieved.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ To secure for the Reich supplies essential to the war from\r\n    all the occupied areas.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ To make preparations for, and to supervise the carrying\r\n    out, in main outline, of the primarily important questions for\r\n    all areas, as for instance, those of finance and funds,\r\n    transport, and the production of oil, coal and food;\r\n\r\n    “2. The carrying out of sharply defined decentralization in the\r\n    separate administration area, grouped together by race or by\r\n    reason of political economy, for the carrying out of the totally\r\n    dissimilar tasks assigned to them.\r\n\r\n    “As against this, an administrative department, regulating\r\n    matters in principle, and to be set up on a purely economic\r\n    basis, as is at present envisaged, might very soon prove to be\r\n    inadequate, and fail in its purpose. Such a central office would\r\n    be compelled to carry out a common policy for all areas,\r\n    dictated only by economic considerations, and this might impede\r\n    the carrying out of the political task and, in view of its being\r\n    run on purely bureaucratic lines, might possibly even prevent\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    “The question therefore arises, whether the opinions which have\r\n    been set forth should not, purely for reasons of expediency, be\r\n    taken into consideration from the very beginning when organizing\r\n    the administration of the territory on a basis of war economy.\r\n    In view of the vast spaces and the difficulties of\r\n    administration which arise from that alone, and also in view of\r\n    the living conditions created by Bolshevism, which are totally\r\n    different from those of Western Europe, the whole question of\r\n    the U.S.S.R. would require different treatment from that which\r\n    has been applied in the individual countries of Western Europe.\r\n\r\n    “2.4.41” (_1017-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the “presently envisaged” administration operating on\r\na purely economic basis, to which this memorandum objects, was the\r\nEconomic Staff _Oldenburg_ which was set up under Goering and Thomas.\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s statement of the political purpose of the invasion and his\r\nanalysis of methods for achieving it apparently did not fall on deaf\r\nears. By a Fuehrer Order dated 20 April 1941 he was named “Commissioner\r\nfor the Central Control of Questions Connected with the East-European\r\nRegion”. This order is part of a correspondence file regarding\r\nRosenberg’s appointment (_865-PS_). Hitler’s order reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I name Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as my Commissioner for the\r\n    central control of questions connected with the East-European\r\n    Region.\r\n\r\n    “An office, which is to be established in accordance with his\r\n    orders, is at the disposal of Reichsleiter Rosenberg for the\r\n    carrying out of the duties thereby entrusted to him.\r\n\r\n    “The necessary money for this office is to be taken out of the\r\n    Reich Chancellery Treasury in a lump sum.\r\n\r\n                           “Fuehrer’s Headquarters 20th April 1941.\r\n                                                     “The Fuehrer\r\n                                             (signed)  Adolf Hitler\r\n                    “Reich Minister and Head of Reich Chancellery\r\n                                             (signed)  Dr. Lammers”\r\n                                                         (_865-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis particular copy of the Fuehrer’s Order was enclosed in a letter\r\nwhich Dr. Lammers wrote to Keitel requesting cooperation for Rosenberg\r\nand asking that Keitel appoint a Deputy to work with Rosenberg.

Although\r\nRosenberg’s files, which were captured intact, were crowded with\r\ndocuments evidencing both the extent of the preparation and its purpose,\r\nthe citation of a small number which are typical should be sufficient.\r\nAll the documents now discussed were found in Rosenberg’s files.\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum dated 8 May 1941, entitled “General Instructions for all\r\nReichcommissars in the occupied Eastern Territories”, Rosenberg gives\r\ninstructions to his chief henchmen and outlines clearly the political\r\naims and purposes of the attack. In the second two paragraphs of the\r\nEnglish translation the following remarks appear:\r\n\r\n    “The only possible political goal of war can be the aim to free\r\n    the German Reich from the Great Russian (_gross-russisch_)\r\n    pressure for centuries to come. This does not only correspond\r\n    with German interests, but also with historical justice, for\r\n    Russian Imperialism was in a position to accomplish its policy\r\n    of conquest and oppression almost unopposed, whilst it\r\n    threatened Germany again and again. Therefore, the German Reich\r\n    has to beware of starting a campaign against Russia with a\r\n    historical injustice, meaning the reconstruction of a Great\r\n    Russian Empire, no matter of what kind. On the contrary, all\r\n    historical struggles of the various nationalities against Moscow\r\n    and Petersburg have to be scrutinized for their bearing on the\r\n    situation today. This has been done on the part of the National\r\n    Socialist movement to correspond to the Leader’s political\r\n    testament as laid down in his book, that now the military and\r\n    political threat, from the East shall be eliminated forever.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore this huge area must be divided according to its\r\n    historical and racial conditions into Reichs-Commissariats, each\r\n    of which bears within itself a different political aim. The\r\n    Reich Commissariat Eastland (_Ostland_) including White Ruthenia\r\n    will have the task, to prepare, by way of development into a\r\n    Germanized Protectorate, a progressively closer cohesion with\r\n    Germany. The Ukraine shall become an independent state in\r\n    alliance with Germany and Caucasia with the contiguous Northern\r\n    Territories a Federal State with a German plenipotentiary.\r\n    Russia proper must put her own house in order for the future.\r\n    These general viewpoints are explained in the following\r\n    instructions for each Reich Commissar. Beyond that there are\r\n    still a few general considerations which possess validity for\r\n    all Reich Commissars.” (_1030-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe fifth paragraph presents an interesting rationalization of a\r\ncontemplated robbery:\r\n\r\n    “The German people has achieved, in the course of centuries,\r\n    tremendous accomplishments in the Eastern European area. Nearly\r\n    its entire real estate property was confiscated without\r\n    indemnification, hundreds of thousands (in the South, on the\r\n    Volga) starved or were deported or, like in the Baltic\r\n    territories, were cheated out of the fruits of their cultural\r\n    work during the past 700 years. The German Reich will now have\r\n    to proclaim the principle, that after the occupation of the\r\n    Eastern Territories, the former German assets have become\r\n    property of the people of Greater Germany, irrespective of the\r\n    consent of the former individual proprietors where the German\r\n    Reich may reserve the right (assuming that it has not already\r\n    been done during resettlement) to arrange a just settlement. The\r\n    manner of compensation and restitution of this national\r\n    property, will be subject to different treatment by each Reich\r\n    Commissariat.” (_1030-PS_)\r\n\r\n“An Instruction for a Reich Commissar in the Baltic Countries and White\r\nRussia” (_1029-PS_) is typical of the directives issued to each of the\r\nappointed commissioners. This order is amazingly frank in outlining the\r\nintentions of the Nazi conspirators toward the country they intended to\r\noccupy in the course of their aggression. It begins:\r\n\r\n    “All the regions between Narva and Tilsit have, constantly been\r\n    in close relationship with the German people. A 700 year old\r\n    history has moulded the inner sympathies of the majority of the\r\n    races living there in a European direction, and has added this\r\n    region to the living space of Greater Germany.\r\n\r\n    “The aim of a Reich Commissar for Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania\r\n    and White Russia [last words added in pencil] must be to strive\r\n    to achieve the form of a German Protectorate, and then transform\r\n    the region into part of the Greater German Reich by germanizing\r\n    racially possible elements, colonizing Germanic races and\r\n    banishing undesirable elements. The Baltic Sea must become a\r\n    Germanic inland sea under the guardianship of Greater Germany.\r\n\r\n    “For certain cattle-raising products, the Baltic region was a\r\n    land of surplus, and the Reich Commissar must endeavor to make\r\n    this surplus once more available to the German people, and, if\r\n    possible, to increase it. With regard to the process of\r\n    germanizing or resettling, the Esthonian people are strongly\r\n    germanized to the extent of 50% by Danish, German and Swedish\r\n    blood and can be considered as a kindred nation. In Latvia, the\r\n    section capable of being assimilated is considerably smaller\r\n    than in Esthonia. In this country stronger resistance will have\r\n    to be reckoned with and banishment on a larger scale will have\r\n    to be envisaged. A similar development may have to be reckoned\r\n    with in Lithuania, for here too the emigration of racial Germans\r\n    is called for in order to promote very intensive Germanization\r\n    (on the East Prussian border).”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The task of a Reich Commissar with his seat of office in Riga\r\n    will therefore largely be an extraordinarily positive one. A\r\n    country which 700 years ago was captured by German Knights built\r\n    up by the Hanseatic League, and by reason of a constant influx\r\n    of German blood, together with Swedish elements, was a\r\n    predominantly Germanized land, is to be established as a mighty,\r\n    German borderland. The preliminary cultural conditions are\r\n    available everywhere, and the German Reich will be able to\r\n    guarantee the right to a later emigration to all those who have\r\n    distinguished themselves in this war, to the descendants of\r\n    those who gave their lives during the war, and also to all who\r\n    fought in the Baltic campaign never once lost courage, fought on\r\n    in the hour of despair and delivered Baltic civilization from\r\n    Bolshevism. For the rest, the solution of the colonization\r\n    problem is not a Baltic question, but one which concerns Greater\r\n    Germany, and it must be settled on these lines.” (_1029-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese two directives are sufficiently typical of the lot to show the\r\nextent of the planning and preparation for this phase of the aggression\r\nas well as the political purpose it was hoped would be achieved thereby.\r\nThey are reinforced by a later report of Rosenberg’s. On 28 June 1941,\r\nless than a week after the invasion, Rosenberg himself prepared a full\r\nreport of his activities since his appointment on the 20th of April\r\n(_1039-PS_). This report makes disclosures concerning the number of\r\nconspirators who worked with and assisted Rosenberg in the planning and\r\npreparation for this phase of the aggression and the extent to which\r\npractically all the ministries and offices of both the State and the\r\nParty were involved in this operation. The report was found in\r\nRosenberg’s files and, although it is rather long, it is of sufficient\r\nimportance in implicating persons, groups and organizations to justify\r\nquotation in full:\r\n\r\n    “_Report on the Preparatory Work in Eastern European Questions_\r\n\r\n    “Immediately after the notification of individual Supreme Reich\r\n    offices regarding the Fuehrer’s decree of 20.4.1941 a conference\r\n    with the Chief of the OKW [Armed Forces High Command] took\r\n    place. After presentation of the various political aims in the\r\n    proposed Reichskommissariats and presentation of personal\r\n    requirements for the East, the Chief of the OKW explained that a\r\n    deferment (_OK-stellung_) would be too complicated in this case\r\n    and that this matter could be carried out best by direct\r\n    cancellation (_Abkommandierung_) by command of the Chief of the\r\n    OKW. Generalfeldmarschall Keitel then issued an appropriate\r\n    command which established the basis for the coming requirements.\r\n    He named as deputy and liaison officer General Jodl and Maj.\r\n    Gen. Warlimont. The negotiations which then commenced relative\r\n    in all questions of the Eastern Territory were carried on by the\r\n    gentlemen of the OKW in collaboration with officials of my\r\n    office.\r\n\r\n    “A conference took place with Admiral Canaris to the effect that\r\n    under the given confidential circumstances my office could in no\r\n    way deal with any representatives of people of the East-European\r\n    area. I asked him to do this insofar as the Military\r\n    intelligence required it, and then to name persons to me who\r\n    could count as political personalities over and above the\r\n    military intelligence in order to arrange for their eventual\r\n    commitment later. Admiral Canaris said that naturally also my\r\n    wish not to recognize any political groups among the emigrants\r\n    would be considered by him and that he was planning to proceed\r\n    in accordance with my indications.\r\n\r\n    “Later on I informed Generalfeldmarschall von Brauchitsch and\r\n    Grossadmiral Raeder about the historical and political\r\n    conceptions of the Eastern problem. In further conferences we\r\n    agreed to appoint a representative of my office to the Supreme\r\n    Commander of the Army, respectively to the chief quartermaster\r\n    and to the army groups for questions relative to political\r\n    configuration and requests of the OKW. In the meantime this has\r\n    been done.\r\n\r\n    “Already at the outset there was a discussion with Minister of\r\n    Economy (_Reichswirtschaftsminister_) Funk, who appointed as his\r\n    permanent deputy Ministerialdirektor Dr. Schlotterer. Almost\r\n    daily conferences were then held with Dr. Schlotterer with\r\n    reference to the war-economic intentions of the Economic\r\n    Operational Staff (_Wirtschaftsfuehrungsstab_) East. In this\r\n    connection I had conferences with General Thomas, State\r\n    Secretary (_Staatssekretaer_) Koerner, State Secretary Backe,\r\n    Ministerial Director Riecke, General Schubert and others.\r\n    Far-reaching agreement was reached in the eastern questions as\r\n    regards direct technical work now and in the future. A few\r\n    problems regarding the relationship of the proposed Reich\r\n    ministry toward the four-year plan are still open and will be\r\n    subject, after submission, to a decision of the Fuehrer. In\r\n    principle I declared that I am in no way intended to found an\r\n    economic department in my office, economics would rather be\r\n    handled substantially and practically by the Reichsmarschall and\r\n    the persons appointed by him, however the two responsible\r\n    department heads, namely Ministerial Director Dr. Schlotterer\r\n    for industrial economics and Ministerial Director Riecke for\r\n    food economies, would be placed in my office as permanent\r\n    liaison men, to coordinate here political aims with the economic\r\n    necessities, in a department which would have to unite yet other\r\n    persons for such coordinating work, depending on later and for\r\n    work (political leadership of labor unions, construction etc.).\r\n    After notification of the Reich foreign minister, the latter\r\n    appointed Geheimrat Grosskopf as permanent liaison man to my\r\n    office. For the requested representation in the political\r\n    department of my office (headed by Reichsamtsleiter Dr.\r\n    Leibbrandt) the foreign ministry released General Counsel Dr.\r\n    Braeutigam, who is known to me for many years, speaks Russian,\r\n    and worked for years in Russia. Negotiations which if necessary\r\n    will be placed before the Fuehrer are under way with the foreign\r\n    office regarding its wishes for the assignment of its\r\n    representatives to the future Reich commissioners.\r\n\r\n    “The propaganda ministry appointed State Secretary Gutterer as\r\n    permanent liaison man, and a complete agreement was reached to\r\n    the effect that the decisions on all political and other essays,\r\n    speeches, proclamations, etc. would be made in my office; a\r\n    great number of substantial works for propaganda would be\r\n    delivered and the papers prepared by the propaganda ministry\r\n    would be modified here if necessary. The whole practical\r\n    employment of propaganda will undisputedly be subject to the\r\n    Reich ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda. For the\r\n    sake of closer cooperation the propaganda ministry assigns yet\r\n    another person directly to my department ‘Enlightenment and\r\n    Press’ (_Aufklaerung und Presse_) and in addition appoints a\r\n    permanent press liaison man. All these activities have been\r\n    going on for some time, and without attracting attention to my\r\n    office in any way, this agreement on contents and terminology\r\n    takes place continually every day.\r\n\r\n    “Thorough discussions took place with Reichsminister Ohnesorge\r\n    concerning future transmission of communication and setting up\r\n    of all technical necessities in future occupied territories;\r\n    with Reichsminister Seldte on the supply of labor forces, with\r\n    Reichsminister Frick (State Secretary Stuckart) in detailed form\r\n    on the assignment of numerous necessary officials for the\r\n    commissariats. According to the present estimate there will be\r\n    four Reichs Kommissariats, as approved by the Fuehrer. I shall\r\n    propose to the Fuehrer for political and other reasons to set up\r\n    a suitable number of General Commissariats (24) Main\r\n    Commissariats (about 80) and Regional (_Gebiet_) Commissariats\r\n    (over 900). A General Commissariat would correspond to a former\r\n    Generalgovernment, a Main Commissariat to a Maingovernment. A\r\n    Regional Commissariat contains 3 or 4 Districts (_Kreise_). In\r\n    view of the huge spaces that is the minimum number which appears\r\n    necessary for a future civil government and/or administration. A\r\n    portion of the officials has already been requested on the basis\r\n    of the above-named command of the Chief of the OKW.\r\n\r\n    “In the same manner conferences have taken place with the Reich\r\n    Physicians Leader (_Reichsaerztefuehrer_) Dr. Conti, the\r\n    Inspector of the Army Veterinary Service, and all specialists\r\n    belonging thereto. The difficulties of medical and veterinary\r\n    supply were thoroughly discussed and the measures were\r\n    previewed, in order to insure well-prepared employment of the\r\n    forces mentioned after the end of the operations. A conference\r\n    with Reichsminister Dr. Todt resulted in the assignment first of\r\n    all of 4 higher leaders of the Construction Service, whereupon\r\n    Dr. Todt proposed to unite administratively under one leadership\r\n    the whole Construction Service.\r\n\r\n    “Discussions took place with Reich Leader Amann and his chief of\r\n    staff Rienhardt regarding the publication of four German\r\n    newspapers in the Reich Commissariats to start with. Furthermore\r\n    a number of newspapers in the prospective native tongues were\r\n    considered. According to the latest information the technical\r\n    forces, for this work are already at the border and may be\r\n    committed at any time to determine whether the prerequisites for\r\n    printing shops are present.\r\n\r\n    “Discussions are also under way with Corpsleader\r\n    (_Korpsfuehrer_) Huehnlein and with the Reich youth leadership\r\n    to assure a necessary and suitable mobilization. Intensive talks\r\n    also took place with the Chief of Staff (_Stabschef_) of the SA.\r\n    He was asked to make available a number of the most reliable SA\r\n    leaders for this gigantic territory, which he agreed to do. The\r\n    personnel suggestions together with other suggestions will be\r\n    submitted to the Fuehrer. The same agreement has been reached\r\n    with the Reich organizational leader\r\n    (_Reichsorganisationsleiter_), who has instructed the commander\r\n    of Kroessinsee, Gohdes, to carry out the swelling channelling of\r\n    requested persons, to admit them into Kroessinsee for schooling\r\n    and instruction on the whole problem and prepare them in the\r\n    best manner for commitment. On the orders of Dr. Ley party\r\n    member Marrenbach was then employed in order to take over\r\n    already now the leadership of Russian labor unions in connection\r\n    with the Wehrmacht. That appeared as an eminently important\r\n    problem, particularly also in connection with the economic\r\n    leadership, because the labor unions undoubtedly have been a\r\n    powerful support of the Soviets and especially have the\r\n    commitment of the German Labor Front appeared necessary under\r\n    certain conditions.\r\n\r\n    “Lengthy discussions regarding the relationship of the Police to\r\n    the new order in the East have taken place. Certain proposed\r\n    changes thereto have been suggested by the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\n    on his order by Gruppenfuehrer [SS Lt Gen] Heydrich which do not\r\n    appear supportable to me for the complete authority of the\r\n    German Reich government in the East. Also the documents of this\r\n    problem will have to be laid before the Fuehrer for decision.\r\n\r\n    “Aside from these negotiations I received the responsible\r\n    deputies of the entire propaganda, namely Ministerial Director\r\n    Fritsche, Ambassador Schmidt, Reich Superintendent of\r\n    Broadcasting Glasmeier, Dr. Grothe OKW, and others. Without\r\n    going into details of political objectives I instructed the\r\n    above-named persons in confidence about the necessary attitude,\r\n    with the request to tone down the whole terminology of the\r\n    press, without issuing any statements.\r\n\r\n    “The works for substantial coverage of the Eastern question\r\n    prepared long ago appeared in my office, which I turned over to\r\n    the propaganda deputies. I enclose a few samples thereof. These\r\n    pamphlets, which may later be turned over to the press for\r\n    development, deal with the whole structure and organization of\r\n    the USSR, the economic possibilities of the East, Agriculture,\r\n    the peoples of the Soviet Union, the work of the Komintern since\r\n    1889, the Jews in the Soviet Union since 1933, statistical\r\n    results of the poll taken among the Germans in Russia, the\r\n    history of the Ukraine, of the Caucasus, of Turkestan. Extensive\r\n    works are in preparation for the foundation of legal\r\n    administration: German law in the Ukraine, German art in the\r\n    Ukraine, influence of the German language on the Ukrainian\r\n    language, the Ukrainians from the viewpoint of the Germans. In\r\n    addition a number of articles are being prepared in Russian\r\n    language which have the purpose of enlightening the people of\r\n    the Soviet Union about true conditions in Germany. These\r\n    articles are also suitable as the basis for newspaper articles\r\n    in the newly occupied territories. Finally, after extensive\r\n    work, an ethnological map of the East based on the most recent\r\n    statistical reports has been printed in great number and made\r\n    available to all offices. This map can be used as the basis of\r\n    eventual fixing of boundaries in the north as well as in the\r\n    south, and offers points of departure for fixing the boundaries\r\n    of the future Reich Commissariats.\r\n\r\n    “As a result of these conferences, conducted for the most part\r\n    by myself, continuous consultation and organizational\r\n    preparation is under way through my office and through those of\r\n    the liaison men delegated from the other offices of the Party\r\n    and the State. I may say that all the work, inasmuch as it is at\r\n    all possible under present condition, is in full swing. Aside\r\n    from the General and Chief commissariats more than 900 Regional\r\n    Commissariats are planned, which must all be manned by political\r\n    leaders, representatives of the department and officials of the\r\n    Reich Ministry of the Interior. The work in the East differs\r\n    basically from the conditions in the West. Whereas we can count\r\n    on every technical installation and a cultured population here\r\n    in the big cities, that is not the case in the East. There\r\n    literally everything will have to be prepared and taken along,\r\n    additionally for the gigantic spaces—not only an auto park but\r\n    a great number of typewriters, office material, above all\r\n    medical supplies and much more down to the bed sheets. It does\r\n    not appear possible to accomplish such a project suddenly in 14\r\n    days, therefore all these arrangements had to be set in full\r\n    motion already now on my responsibility on the basis of the\r\n    Fuehrer’s decree.\r\n\r\n    “The structure of my office itself is temporarily organized as\r\n    follows in carrying out the Fuehrer’s order. I have requested\r\n    Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter Dr. Meyer as my permanent\r\n    representative. He has negotiated personally and thoroughly,\r\n    through the whole time with all pertinent offices, in order to\r\n    develop all aspects down to the details. A political department\r\n    has been founded for the execution of the substantial work,\r\n    under my co-worker of many years Dr. Leibbrandt (deputy General\r\n    Consul Dr. Braeutigam), who prepares the various books and\r\n    pamphlets for information. A great number of propaganda leaflets\r\n    have been composed by him which will then have been scattered\r\n    over the Russian front in huge numbers by the armed forces. Also\r\n    for a specific time other leaflets are ready which are addressed\r\n    directly to the individual races. I do not care to decide on\r\n    this date for myself, and will lay these originals before the\r\n    Fuehrer at the first opportunity with the request to check the\r\n    contents and determine the time of the eventually approved\r\n    appeals. The political department is also undertaking a thorough\r\n    investigation of all those, with the exception of Russians, who\r\n    eventually can be used as advisors for the administration of the\r\n    various nationalities. Continuous discussions about this subject\r\n    are under way with representatives of the OKW, the propaganda\r\n    ministry, etc. Secondly a department of economic—political\r\n    cooperation has been founded under direction of\r\n    Oberbereichsleiter Malletke. A department of ‘Law, Finance, and\r\n    Administration’ has been taken over by Regierungspraesident\r\n    Runte. A department for Culture and Science is as yet unoccupied\r\n    since the development of this question does not appear urgent.\r\n    Also the department ‘Enlightenment and Press’. It is occupied by\r\n    Major of the Air Force Carl Cranz, deputy Job Zimmermann.\r\n    Integrated here are co-workers who command the Russian,\r\n    Ukrainian, and other languages. The wishes of the Reich Press\r\n    Chief (_Reichspressechef_) for setting up one press chief for\r\n    each Reichskommissar are under discussion in order to decide\r\n    them in that sense if possible.\r\n\r\n    “Thus I hope that when, after preliminary conclusion of the\r\n    military action the Fuehrer has the possibility for a report\r\n    from me, I shall be able to report to the Fuehrer far-reaching\r\n    preparations, up to those points of special and personal nature\r\n    which the Fuehrer alone can decide.” (_1039-PS_)\r\n\r\n(As a part of the case to be presented by the Soviet prosecuting staff,\r\nit will be shown how all this planning and preparation for the\r\nelimination of the U.S.S.R. as a political factor were actually carried\r\nout. The planned execution of intelligentsia, and other Russian leaders\r\nwas, for example, but a part of the actual operation of the program to\r\ndestroy the Soviet Union politically and make impossible its early\r\nresurrection as a European Power.)\r\n\r\nHaving thus elaborately prepared on every side for the invasion of the\r\nSoviet Union, the Nazi conspirators proceeded to carry out their plans\r\nand on 22 June 1941 hurled their armies across the borders of the\r\nU.S.S.R. In announcing this act of perfidy to the world, Hitler issued a\r\nproclamation on the day of the attack, which declared: “I have therefore\r\ntoday decided to give the fate of Europe again into the hands of our\r\nsoldiers.”\r\n\r\nThis announcement told the world that the die had been cast; that the\r\nplans darkly conceived almost a full year before and secretly and\r\ncontinuously developed since then, had now been brought to fruition. The\r\nNazi conspirators, having carefully and completely planned and prepared\r\nthis war of aggression, now proceeded to initiate and wage it.\r\n\r\nF. _The Motives for the Attack._\r\n\r\nIt should first be pointed out that not only was Germany bound by solemn\r\ncovenant not to attack the U.S.S.R., but throughout the entire period\r\nfrom August 1939 to the invasion in 1941, the Soviet Union was faithful\r\nto its agreements with Germany and displayed no aggressive intentions\r\ntoward the territories of the German Reich. General Thomas, for example,\r\npoints out in his draft of “Basic Facts for a History of the German War\r\nand Armaments Economy” (_2353-PS_), that insofar as the German-Soviet\r\ntrade agreement of 11 August 1939 was concerned, the Soviets carried out\r\ntheir deliveries thereunder up to the very end. Thomas points out that\r\ndeliveries by the Soviets were usually made quickly and well, and since\r\nthe food and raw material being thus delivered was considered essential\r\nto the German economy, efforts were made to keep up their side too.\r\nHowever, as preparations for the campaign proceeded, the Nazis cared\r\nless about maintaining their obligations. At page 315 of his book Thomas\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    “Later on the urgency of the Russian deliveries diminished, as\r\n    preparations for the campaign in the East were already under\r\n    way.\r\n\r\n    “The Russians carried out their deliveries as planned, right up\r\n    to the start of the attack; even during the last few days,\r\n    transports of India-rubber from the Far East were completed by\r\n    Express transit trains.” (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain at page 404, Thomas brings this point out even more forcefully:\r\n\r\n    “In addition to the Italian negotiations, until June, 1941, the\r\n    negotiations with Russia were accorded a great deal of\r\n    attention. The Fuehrer issued the directive that, in order to\r\n    camouflage German troop movements, the orders Russia has placed\r\n    in Germany must be filled as promptly as possible. Since the\r\n    Russians only made grain deliveries, when the Germans delivered\r\n    orders placed by the Russians, and since in the case of\r\n    individual firms these deliveries to Russia made it impossible\r\n    for them to fill orders for the German armed forces, it was\r\n    necessary for the Wi Rue office to enter into numerous\r\n    individual negotiations with German firms in order to coordinate\r\n    Russian orders with those of the German from the standpoint of\r\n    priority. In accordance with the wishes of the Foreign Office,\r\n    German industry was instructed to accept all Russian orders,\r\n    even if it were impossible to fill them within the limits of the\r\n    time set for manufacture and delivery. Since in May especially,\r\n    large deliveries had to be made to the Navy, the firms were\r\n    instructed to allow the equipment to go through the Russian\r\n    Acceptance Commission, then, however, to make such a detour\r\n    during its transportation as to make it impossible for it to be\r\n    delivered over the frontier prior to the beginning of the German\r\n    attack.” (_2353-PS_)\r\n\r\nNot only was the Soviet Union faithful to its treaty obligations with\r\nGermany, but she had no aggressive intentions toward German territory. A\r\nfile on Russo-German relations found in the files of the Naval High\r\nCommand, covering the entire period from the treaty to the attack\r\n(_C-170_), demonstrates this point conclusively. It will be sufficient\r\nto quote a few entries, which include reports from the German ambassador\r\nin Moscow as late as June 1941. Entry 165 reads:\r\n\r\n    “165 A 22.29 4 June\r\n\r\n    “Outwardly, no change in the relationship Germany-Russia.\r\n    Russian deliveries continue to full satisfaction. Russian\r\n    government is endeavoring to do everything to prevent a conflict\r\n    with Germany.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nEntry 167 reads:\r\n\r\n    “167 A 22.53 6 June\r\n\r\n    “Ambassador in Moscow reports * * * Russia will only fight if\r\n    attacked by Germany. Situation is considered in Moscow much more\r\n    serious than up to now. All military preparations have been made\r\n    quietly—as far as can be recognized only defensive. Russian\r\n    policy still strives as before to produce the best possible\r\n    relationship to Germany as good.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nEntry 169 also reiterates this point:\r\n\r\n    “169 A 22.65 7 June\r\n\r\n    “From the report of the Ambassador in Moscow * * *. All\r\n    observations show that Stalin and Molotov, who alone are\r\n    responsible for Russian foreign policy, are doing everything to\r\n    avoid a conflict with Germany. The entire behavior of the\r\n    Government, as well as the attitude of the press, which reports\r\n    all events concerning Germany in a factual, indisputable manner,\r\n    support this view. The loyal fulfillment of the economic treaty\r\n    with Germany proves the same thing.” (_C-170_)\r\n\r\nThe reasons, therefore, which led to the attack on the Soviet Union\r\ncould not have been self-defense or treaty breaches. No doubt, as has\r\nbeen necessarily implied from the materials presented on planning and\r\npreparation, more than one motive entered into the decision of the Nazi\r\nconspirators to launch their aggression against the U.S.S.R. All of\r\nthem, however, appear to blend into one grand motif of Nazi policy. The\r\npattern into which these varied reasons fall is the traditional Nazi\r\nambition for expansion to the East at the expense of the U.S.S.R. This\r\nNazi version of an earlier imperial imperative, “_Drang Nach Osten_,”\r\nhad been a cardinal principle of the Party almost since its birth, and\r\nrested on the twin bases of political strategy and economic\r\naggrandizement. Politically, such action meant elimination of the\r\npowerful force to the East, which might constitute a threat to German\r\nambition, and acquisition of _Lebensraum_. Economically, it offered\r\nopportunities for the plunder of vast quantities of food, raw materials,\r\nand other supplies. Undoubtedly the demands of the German War economy\r\nfor food and raw material served to revive the attractiveness of the\r\neconomic side of this theory while the difficulties Germany was\r\nexperiencing in defeating England reaffirmed for the Nazi conspirators\r\nthe temporarily forgotten Nazi political imperative of eliminating, as a\r\npolitical factor, their one formidable opponent on the continent.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1923 Hitler outlined this theory in some detail in _Mein\r\nKampf_, where he stated, at page 641 of the Houghton Mifflin English\r\nedition:\r\n\r\n    “There are two reasons which induce me to submit to a special\r\n    examination the relation of Germany to Russia:\r\n\r\n    “1. Here perhaps we are dealing with the most decisive concern\r\n    of all German foreign affairs; and\r\n\r\n    “2. This question is also the touchstone for the political\r\n    capacity of the young National Socialist movement to think\r\n    clearly and to act correctly.”\r\n\r\nAgain, at page 654 of the same edition:\r\n\r\n    “And so we National Socialists consciously draw a line beneath\r\n    the foreign policy tendency of our pre-war period. We take up\r\n    where we broke off six hundred years ago. We stop the endless\r\n    German movement to the south and west, and turn our gaze toward\r\n    the land in the east. At long last we break off the colonial and\r\n    commercial policy of the pre-war period and shift to the soil\r\n    policy of the future.\r\n\r\n    “If we speak of soil in Europe today, we can primarily have in\r\n    mind only Russia and her vassal border states.”\r\n\r\nThe political portion of this dichotomy of purpose is clearly reflected\r\nin the stated purposes, previously discussed, of the organization which\r\nRosenberg set up to administer the occupied Eastern Territories. In a\r\nspeech which Rosenberg delivered, two days before the attack, to the\r\npeople most interested in the problem of the East, he restated in his\r\nusual somewhat mystic fashion the political basis for the campaign and\r\nits interrelationship with the economic goal (_1058-PS_). A short\r\nextract from that speech reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The job of feeding the German people stands, this year, without\r\n    a doubt, at the top of the list of Germany’s claims on the East;\r\n    and here the southern territories and the northern Caucasus will\r\n    have to serve as a balance for the feeding of the German people.\r\n    We see absolutely no reason for any obligation on our part to\r\n    feed also the Russian people with the products of that surplus\r\n    territory. We know that this is a harsh necessity, bare of any\r\n    feelings. A very extensive evacuation will be necessary, without\r\n    any doubt, and it is sure that the future will hold very hard\r\n    years in store for the Russians. A later decision will have to\r\n    determine to which extent industries can still be maintained\r\n    there (Wagon Factories, etc.). The consideration and execution\r\n    of this policy in the Russian area proper is for the German\r\n    Reich and its future a tremendous and by no means negative task,\r\n    as might appear, if one takes only the harsh necessity of the\r\n    evacuation into consideration. The conversion of Russian\r\n    dynamics towards the East is a task which requires the strongest\r\n    characters. Perhaps, this decision will also be approved by a\r\n    coming Russia later, not in 30 but maybe in a 100 years. For the\r\n    Russian soul has been torn in the struggle of the last 200\r\n    years. The original Russians are excellent artistic craftsmen,\r\n    dancers and musicians. They have certain hereditary talents, but\r\n    these talents are different from these of the Western people.\r\n    The fight between Turgenjew and Dostejewsky was symbolic for the\r\n    nation. The Russian soul found no outlet, either way. If we now\r\n    close the West to the Russians, they might become conscious of\r\n    their own inborn, proper forces and of the area to which they\r\n    belong. An historian will maybe see this decision in a different\r\n    light, in hundreds of years than it might appear to a Russian\r\n    today.” (_1058-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated, the failure of the Nazi conspirators to defeat\r\nBritain had served further to strengthen them in their belief in the\r\npolitical necessity of eliminating the Soviet Union as a European factor\r\nbefore Germany could completely achieve her role as the master of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe economic motive for the aggression was disclosed in the previous\r\ndiscussion of the organization set up under Goering and General Thomas\r\nto carry out the economic exploitation of the territory to be occupied.\r\nThe purely materialistic basis for the attack was unmistakable. If any\r\ndoubt existed that at least one of the main purposes of the invasion was\r\nto steal the food and raw material needed for the Nazi war machine,\r\nregardless of the consequences to the Russian people which such robbery\r\nwould entail, that doubt is dispelled by a memorandum showing clear and\r\nconscious recognition by the Nazis that their plans would no doubt\r\nresult in starving to death millions of people. (_2718-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 20 June 1941 General Thomas wrote a memorandum along a similar line,\r\nin which he stated that Keitel had confirmed to him Hitler’s present\r\nconception of the German economic policy concerning raw materials\r\n(_1456-PS_). This policy expressed the theory that less manpower would\r\nbe used in the conquest of sources of raw materials than would be\r\nnecessary to produce synthetics in lieu of such raw materials. This\r\nmemorandum reads, in part:\r\n\r\n    “The following is the new conception of the Fuehrer, which\r\n    Minister Todt has explained to me and which has been confirmed\r\n    later on by Field Marshal Keitel:\r\n\r\n    “1. The course of the war shows that we went too far in our\r\n    autarchical endeavors. It is impossible to try and manufacture\r\n    everything we lack, by synthetic procedures, or other measures.\r\n    For instance, it is impossible to develop our motor fuel economy\r\n    to a point where we can entirely depend on it. All these\r\n    autarchical endeavors ask for a tremendous amount of manpower,\r\n    and it is simply impossible to provide it. One has to choose\r\n    another way. What one does not have, but needs, one must\r\n    conquer. The commitment of men which is necessary one single\r\n    time, will not be as great as the one that is currently needed\r\n    for the running of the synthetic factories in question. The aim\r\n    must also be to secure all territories, which are of special\r\n    interest to us for the war economy, by conquering them.\r\n\r\n    “At the time the 4-year-plan was established, I issued the\r\n    statement where I made it clear that a completely autarchical\r\n    economy is impossible for us, because the need of men will be\r\n    too great. Nevertheless, my solution was always to provide the\r\n    necessary reserves for missing stocks respectively to secure the\r\n    delivery in wartime through economic alliances.” (_1456-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn this macabre note the story of this aggression comes to an end. In\r\nview of the solemn pledge of nonaggression; the base and sinister\r\nmotives involved; the months of secret planning and preparation; and the\r\nsuffering intentionally and deliberately wrought; it may perhaps not be\r\ntoo much to say that in the history of relations between sovereign\r\nnations, a blacker chapter has never been written than the one which\r\ntells of the Nazi conspirators’ unprovoked invasion of the territory of\r\nthe Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO AGGRESSION AGAINST\r\n                                THE USSR\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a)               │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F)  │      │\r\n                │  6; V.                                 │  I   │  27, 29\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

COLLABORATION WITH ITALY AND JAPAN AND\r\n                AGGRESSIVE WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES:\r\n                     NOVEMBER 1936 TO DECEMBER 1941\r\n\r\nIn the course of two years, the swastika had been carried forward by\r\nforce of arms from a tightly controlled and remilitarized Germany to the\r\nfour corners of Europe. The conspirators then projected the Nazi plan\r\nupon a universal screen, involving the old World of Asia and the New\r\nWorld of the United States of America. As a result, the wars of\r\naggression that were planned in Berlin and launched across the frontiers\r\nof Poland ended some six years later, almost to the day, in surrender\r\nceremonies aboard a United States battleship riding at anchor in the Bay\r\nof Tokyo.\r\n\r\nA. _Formal German—Japanese—Italian Alliances._\r\n\r\nThe first formal alliance between Hitler’s Germany and the Japanese\r\nGovernment was the Anti-Comintern Pact signed in Berlin on 25 November\r\n1936 (_2508-PS_). This agreement, on its face, was directed against the\r\nactivities of the Communist International. It was subsequently adhered\r\nto by Italy on 6 November 1937 (_2506-PS_).\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact—especially in light of the evidence to be\r\npresented regarding Ribbentrop’s active participation in collaboration\r\nwith the Japanese—that Ribbentrop signed the Anti-Comintern Pact for\r\nGermany, at Berlin, even though at that time, November 1936, Ribbentrop\r\nwas not the German Foreign Minister, but simply Hitler’s Special\r\nAmbassador Plenipotentiary.\r\n\r\nOn 27 September 1940, some four years after the Anti-Comintern Pact was\r\nsigned and one year after the initiation of war in Europe, the German,\r\nItalian, and Japanese Governments signed another pact at Berlin—a\r\nten-year military-economic alliance (_2643-PS_). Again Ribbentrop signed\r\nfor Germany, this time in his capacity as Foreign Minister: This\r\nTripartite Pact pledged Germany, Italy, and Japan to support of, and\r\ncollaboration with each other in the establishment of a “new order” in\r\nEurope and East Asia. The agreement stated, in part:\r\n\r\n    “The Governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan consider it as a\r\n    condition precedent of a lasting peace, that each nation of the\r\n    world be given its own proper place. They have therefore decided\r\n    to stand together and to cooperate with one another in their\r\n    efforts in Greater East Asia and in the regions of Europe,\r\n    wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a\r\n    new order of things calculated to promote the prosperity and\r\n    welfare of the peoples there. Furthermore, it is the desire of\r\n    the three Governments to extend this cooperation to such nations\r\n    in other parts of the world as are inclined to give to their\r\n    endeavors a direction similar to their own, in order that their\r\n    aspirations towards world peace as the ultimate goal may thus be\r\n    realized. Accordingly, the Governments of Germany, Italy, and\r\n    Japan have agreed as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Article 1: Japan recognizes and respects the leadership of\r\n    Germany and Italy in the establishment of a new order in Europe.\r\n\r\n    “Article 2: Germany and Italy recognize and respect the\r\n    leadership of Japan in the establishment of a new order in\r\n    Greater East Asia.\r\n\r\n    “Article 3: Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to cooperate in\r\n    their efforts on the aforesaid basis. They further undertake to\r\n    assist one another with all political, economic and military\r\n    means, if one of the three Contracting Parties is attacked by a\r\n    Power at present not involved in the European war or in the\r\n    Chinese-Japanese conflict.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Article 6: The present Pact shall come into force immediately\r\n    upon signature and shall remain in force for ten years from the\r\n    date of its coming into force.” (_2643-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Tripartite Pact of 27 September 1940 thus was a bold announcement to\r\nthe world that the leaders of Germany, Japan, and Italy had cemented a\r\nfull military alliance to achieve world domination and to establish the\r\n“new order” presaged by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the\r\nItalian conquest of Ethiopia in 1935, and the Nazi overflow into Austria\r\nearly in 1938.\r\n\r\nA statement by Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of the United States at\r\nthe time of the signing of the Tripartite Pact, is relevant in this\r\nconnection. Mr. Hull declared:\r\n\r\n    “The reported agreement of alliance does not, in the view of the\r\n    Government of the United States, substantially alter a situation\r\n    which has existed for several years. Announcement of the\r\n    alliance merely makes clear to all a relationship which has long\r\n    existed in effect and to which this Government has repeatedly\r\n    called attention. That such an agreement has been in process of\r\n    conclusion has been well known for some time, and that fact has\r\n    been fully taken into account by the Government of United States\r\n    in the determining of this country’s policies.” (_2944-PS_)\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made here to trace the relationships and negotiations\r\nleading up to the Tripartite Pact of 27 November 1940. Nevertheless, one\r\nexample of the type of German-Japanese relationship existing before the\r\nformalization of the Tripartite Pact is noteworthy—the record of a\r\nconversation of 31 January 1939 between Himmler and General Oshima,\r\nJapanese Ambassador at Berlin. This record, which is signed by Himmler\r\nin crayon, reads:\r\n\r\n    “_File Memorandum_\r\n\r\n    “Today I visited General Oshima. The conversation ranged over\r\n    the following subjects:\r\n\r\n    “1. The Fuehrer speech, which pleased him very much, especially\r\n    because it had been spiritually warranted in all its features.\r\n\r\n    “2. We discussed conclusion of a treaty to consolidate the\r\n    triangle Germany/Italy/Japan into an even firmer mold. He also\r\n    told me that, together with German counter-espionage (_Abwehr_),\r\n    he was undertaking long-range projects aimed at the\r\n    disintegration of Russia and emanating from the Caucasus and the\r\n    Ukraine. However, this organization was to become effective only\r\n    in case of war.\r\n\r\n    “3. Furthermore he had succeeded up to now to send 10 Russians\r\n    with bombs across the Caucasian frontier. These Russians had the\r\n    mission to kill Stalin. A number of additional Russians, whom he\r\n    had also sent across, had been shot at the frontier.”\r\n    (_2195-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Nazi Encouragement of Aggression by Japan_\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators, once their military and economic alliance with\r\nJapan had been formalized, exhorted the Japanese to aggression against\r\nthose nations with whom they were at war and against those with whom\r\nthey contemplated war. In this the Nazi conspirators pursued a course\r\nstrikingly parallel to that followed in their relationship with the\r\nother member of the European Axis. On 10 June 1940, in fulfillment of\r\nher alliance with Germany, Italy had carried out her “stab in the back”\r\nby declaring war against France and Great Britain. The Nazi conspirators\r\nset about to induce similar action by Japan on the other side of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe nations against whom the German-Japanese collaboration was aimed, at\r\nvarious times, were the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Union of\r\nSoviet Socialist Republics, and the United States of America.\r\n\r\n(1) _Exhortations to Attack the British Commonwealth._ At least as early\r\nas 23 February 1941 the Nazi conspirators undertook to exploit their\r\nalliance with Japan by exhortations to commit aggression against the\r\nBritish Commonwealth. Again the figure of Ribbentrop appears. On that\r\ndate, 23 February 1941, he held a conference with General Oshima, the\r\nJapanese Ambassador to Berlin, at which he urged that the Japanese open\r\nhostilities against the British in the Far East as soon as possible.\r\n(_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs can be seen on the cover page of the English translation of the\r\nreport of that conference, Ribbentrop on 2 March sent copies of an\r\nextract of the record of this conference to his various ambassadors and\r\nministers for their “strictly confidential and purely personal\r\ninformation,” with the further note that “these statements are of\r\nfundamental significance for orientation in the general political\r\nsituation facing Germany in early Spring 1941.” The report stated, in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n                                                  “Strictly secret\r\n                                “Extract\r\n\r\n    “from the report of the conference of the Reich Foreign Minister\r\n    with Ambassador Oshima in Fuschl on 13 February 1941.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “After particularly cordial mutual greetings, the RAM [Reich\r\n    Foreign Minister] declared that Ambassador Oshima had been\r\n    proved right in the policy he had pursued regarding Germany in\r\n    the face of the many doubters in Japan. By Germany’s victory in\r\n    the west these policies had been fully vindicated. He [the RAM]\r\n    regretted that the alliance between Germany and Japan, for which\r\n    he had been working with the Ambassador for many years already,\r\n    had come into being only after various detours, but public\r\n    opinion in Japan had not been ripe for it earlier. The main\r\n    thing was, however, that they are together now.\r\n\r\n    “* * * Now the _German-Japanese alliance_ has been concluded.\r\n    Ambassador Oshima is the man who gets credit for it from the\r\n    Japanese side. After conclusion of the alliance the question of\r\n    its further _development_ now stands in the foreground. How is\r\n    the situation in this respect? (_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop subsequently proceeded to shape the argument for Japanese\r\nintervention against the British. First outlining the intended air and\r\nU-boat warfare against England, he said:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Thereby England’s situation would take catastrophic shape\r\n    overnight. The landing in England is prepared; its execution,\r\n    however, depends on various factors, above all on weather\r\n    conditions.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer would beat England wherever he would encounter her.\r\n    Besides our strength is not only equal, but superior to a\r\n    combined English-American air force at any time. The number of\r\n    pilots at our disposal was unlimited. The same was true for our\r\n    airplane production capacity. As far as quality is concerned\r\n    ours was always superior to the English (to say nothing about\r\n    the American) and we were on the way even to enlarge this lead.\r\n    On order of the Fuehrer the antiaircraft defense too would be\r\n    greatly reinforced. Since the army had been supplied far beyond\r\n    its requirements, and enormous reserves had been piled up (the\r\n    ammunitions plants have been slowed down because of the immense\r\n    stock of material), production would now be concentrated on\r\n    submarines, airplanes and antiaircraft guns.\r\n\r\n    “Every eventuality had been provided for; the war has been won\r\n    today militarily, economically and politically. We had the\r\n    desire to end the war quickly and to force England to sue for\r\n    peace soon. The Fuehrer was vigorous and healthy, fully\r\n    convinced of victory and determined to bring the war to a quick\r\n    and victorious end. To this end the cooperation with Japan was\r\n    of importance. However, Japan in its own interest, should come\r\n    in as soon as possible. This would destroy England’s key\r\n    position in the Far East. Japan, on the other hand, would thus\r\n    secure its position in the Far East, a position which it could\r\n    acquire only through war. There were three reasons for quick\r\n    action:\r\n\r\n    “1. Intervention by Japan would mean a decisive blow against the\r\n    center of the British Empire (threat to India, cruiser-warfare,\r\n    etc.) The effect upon the morale of the British people would be\r\n    very serious and this would contribute toward a quick ending of\r\n    the war.\r\n\r\n    “2. A surprising intervention by Japan was bound to keep America\r\n    out of the war. America, which at present is not armed as yet\r\n    and would hesitate greatly to expose her Navy to any risks West\r\n    of Hawaii, could do this even less so in such a case. If Japan\r\n    would otherwise respect the American interests, there would not\r\n    even be the possibility for Roosevelt to use the argument of\r\n    lost prestige to make war plausible to the Americans. It was\r\n    very unlikely that America would declare war if it then would\r\n    have to stand by helplessly while Japan takes the Philippines\r\n    without America being able to do anything about it.\r\n\r\n    “3. In view of the coming new world order it seems to be in the\r\n    interest of Japan also to secure for herself already during the\r\n    war the position she wants to hold in the Far East at the time\r\n    of a peace treaty. Ambassador Oshima agreed with me entirely and\r\n    said that he would do everything to carry through this policy.”\r\n    (_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe subtlety of Ribbentrop’s argument is noteworthy. First he told the\r\nJapanese Ambassador that Germany had already practically won the war by\r\nherself. Nevertheless, he suggested that the war could be successfully\r\nterminated more quickly with Japan’s aid and that the moment was\r\npropitious for Japan’s entry. Then, referring to the spoils of conquest,\r\nhe indicated that Japan would be best advised to pick up by herself\r\nduring the war the positions she wanted, implying that she would have to\r\nearn her share of the booty.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Ribbentrop’s argument shows something of the real\r\nnature of the German-Japanese alliance:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Foreign Minister continued by saying that it was\r\n    Japan’s friendship which had enabled Germany to arm after the\r\n    Anti-Comintern Pact was concluded. On the other hand, Japan had\r\n    been able to penetrate deeply into the English sphere of\r\n    interest in China. Germany’s victory on the continent has\r\n    brought now, after the conclusion of the Three Power Pact, great\r\n    advantages for Japan. France, as a power, was eliminated in the\r\n    Far East (Indo-China). England too was considerably weakened;\r\n    Japan had been able to close in steadily on Singapore. Thus,\r\n    Germany had already contributed enormously to the shaping of the\r\n    future fate of the two nations. Due to our geographical\r\n    situation we should have to carry the main burden of the final\r\n    battle in the future, too. If an unwanted conflict with Russia\r\n    should arise we should have to carry the main burden also in\r\n    this case. If Germany should ever weaken Japan would find itself\r\n    confronted by a world-coalition within a short time. We were all\r\n    in the same boat. The fate of both nations was being determined\r\n    now for centuries to come. The same was true for Italy. The\r\n    interests of the three countries would never intersect. A defeat\r\n    of Germany would also mean the end of the Japanese imperialistic\r\n    idea. “Ambassador Oshima definitely agreed with these statements\r\n    and emphasized the fact that Japan was determined to keep its\r\n    imperial position. The Reich Foreign Minister then discussed the\r\n    great problems which would arise after the war for the parties\r\n    of the Three Power Pact from the shaping of a new order in\r\n    Europe and East Asia. The problems arising then would require a\r\n    bold solution. Thereby no overcentralization should take place,\r\n    but a solution should be found on a basis of parity,\r\n    particularly in the economic realm. In regard to this the Reich\r\n    Foreign Minister advanced the principle that a free exchange of\r\n    trade should take place between the two spheres of interest on a\r\n    liberal basis. The European-African hemisphere under the\r\n    leadership of Germany and Italy, and the East-Asian sphere of\r\n    interest under the leadership of Japan. As he conceived it, for\r\n    example, Japan would conduct trade and make trade agreements\r\n    directly with the independent states in the European hemisphere,\r\n    as heretofore, while Germany and Italy would trade directly and\r\n    make trade agreements with the independent countries within the\r\n    Japanese orbit of power, such as China, Thailand, Indochina,\r\n    etc. Furthermore, as between the two economic spheres, each\r\n    should fundamentally grant the other preferences with regard to\r\n    third parties. The Ambassador expressed agreement with this\r\n    thought.” (_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe instigation to war by Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister, is\r\nclear. The participation of the German military representatives in the\r\nencouragement and provocation of wars of aggression is shown in a Top\r\nSecret order signed by Keitel as Chief of the OKW and entitled “Basic\r\nOrder No. 24 Regarding Collaboration with Japan” (_C-75_). It is dated 5\r\nMarch 1941, about a week and a half after Ribbentrop’s conference with\r\nOshima, just discussed. It was distributed in 14 copies to the highest\r\ncommands of the Army, Navy, and Air Force as well as to the Foreign\r\nOffice. Two copies of this order, identical except for handwritten\r\nnotations presumably made by the recipients, were turned up by the\r\nprosecution. Document _C-75_ is Copy No. 2 of the order, distributed to\r\nthe Naval War Staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (the OKM).\r\nCopy No. 4, designed for the _Wehrmacht Fuehrungsstab_—the Operations\r\nStaff of the High Command of the Armed Forces—was found in the OKW\r\nfiles at Flensburg. The head of this Operations Staff was Jodl.\r\n\r\nBasic Order No. 24 was the authoritative Nazi policy on collaboration\r\nwith Japan (_C-75_). It reads:\r\n\r\n                              “TOP SECRET\r\n                            “Only by Officer\r\n\r\n    “Armed Forces High Command (OKW)\r\n\r\n      Joint Operations Staff, Branch L (I Op.)\r\n\r\n    No. 44 282/41 Top Secret\r\n\r\n                                            “Fuehrer’s Headquarters\r\n                                                      5 March 1941\r\n                       [Various handwritten notations and stamps]\r\n                                                       “14 copies\r\n                                                        “2nd copy\r\n                          “Basic Order No. 24\r\n                   regarding collaboration with Japan\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has issued the following order regarding\r\n    collaboration with Japan:\r\n\r\n    “1. It must be the _aim_ of the collaboration based on the Three\r\n    Power Pact to induce Japan as soon as possible _to take active\r\n    measures in the Far East_. Strong British forces will thereby be\r\n    tied down, and the center of gravity of the interests of the\r\n    United States of America will be diverted to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n    “The sooner it intervenes, the greater will be the prospects of\r\n    success for Japan in view of the still undeveloped preparedness\r\n    for war on the part of its adversaries. The “Barbarossa”\r\n    operation will create particularly favorable political and\r\n    military prerequisites for this. [Marginal note—“slightly\r\n    exaggerated”]\r\n\r\n    “2. _To prepare the way_ for the collaboration it is essential\r\n    to strengthen the _Japanese military potential_ with all means\r\n    available.\r\n\r\n    “For this purpose the High Commands of the branches of the Armed\r\n    Forces will comply in a comprehensive and generous manner with\r\n    Japanese desires for information regarding German war and combat\r\n    experience and for assistance in military economics and in\r\n    technical matters. Reciprocity is desirable but this factor\r\n    should not stand in the way of negotiations. Priority should\r\n    naturally be given to those Japanese requests which would have\r\n    the most immediate application in waging war.\r\n\r\n    “In special cases the Fuehrer reserves the decisions to himself.\r\n\r\n    “3. The _harmonizing of the operational plans of the two\r\n    parties_ is the responsibility of the Navy High Command.\r\n\r\n    “This will be subject to the following guiding principles:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ The _common aim_ of the conduct of war is to be stressed\r\n    as forcing England to the ground quickly and thereby keeping the\r\n    United States out of the war. Beyond this Germany has no\r\n    political, military, or economic interests in the Far East which\r\n    would give occasion for any reservations with regard to Japanese\r\n    intentions.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ The great successes achieved by Germany in _mercantile\r\n    warfare_ make it appear particularly suitable to employ strong\r\n    Japanese forces for the same purpose. In this connection every\r\n    opportunity to support German mercantile warfare must be\r\n    exploited.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ The _raw material situation_ of the _pact powers_ demands\r\n    that Japan should acquire possession of those territories which\r\n    it needs for the continuation of the war, especially if the\r\n    United States intervenes. Rubber shipments must be carried out\r\n    even after the entry of Japan into the war, since they are of\r\n    vital importance to Germany.\r\n\r\n    “_d._ The _seizure of Singapore_ as the key British position in\r\n    the Far East would mean a decisive success for the entire\r\n    conduct of war of the Three Powers.\r\n\r\n    “In addition, attacks on other systems of bases of British naval\r\n    power—extending to those of American naval power only if the\r\n    entry of the United States into the war cannot be\r\n    prevented—will result in weakening the enemy’s system of power\r\n    in that region and also, just like the attack on sea\r\n    communications, in tying down substantial forces of all kinds\r\n    (Australia).\r\n\r\n    “A date for the beginning of operational discussions cannot yet\r\n    be fixed.\r\n\r\n    “4. In the _military commissions_ to be formed in accordance\r\n    with the _Three Power Pact_, only such questions are to be dealt\r\n    with as equally concern the _three_ participating powers. These\r\n    will include primarily the problems of _economic warfare_.\r\n\r\n    “The working out of the details is the responsibility of the\r\n    “Main Commission” with the cooperation of the Armed Forces High\r\n    Command.\r\n\r\n    “5. The Japanese must not be given any intimation of the\r\n    Barbarossa operation.\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of the Armed Forces High Command\r\n\r\n    “Signed in draft:  Keitel\r\n\r\n                                         “Correctness certified by\r\n                                                            JUNGE\r\n                                     Lieutenant Commander” (_C-75_)\r\n\r\nIt appears from this document that the Nazi conspirators’ cardinal\r\noperational principle in their collaboration with Japan was, as early as\r\nMarch 1941, the inducement of Japan to aggression against Singapore and\r\nother British Far Eastern bases.\r\n\r\nA meeting was held on 18 March 1941, about two weeks after the issuance\r\nof Basic Order No. 24 (_C-75_) and was attended by Hitler, Raeder,\r\nKeitel, and Jodl. The top secret record of this meeting discloses that\r\nRaeder, then Commander in Chief of the Navy, made the following\r\ncalculations:\r\n\r\n    “Japan must take steps to seize Singapore as soon as possible,\r\n    since the opportunity will never again be as favourable (whole\r\n    English Fleet contained; unpreparedness of U. S. A. for war\r\n    against Japan; inferiority of U. S. Fleet vis-à-vis the\r\n    Japanese). Japan is indeed making preparations for this action,\r\n    but according to all declarations made by Japanese officers she\r\n    will only carry it out if Germany proceeds to land in England.\r\n    Germany must therefore concentrate all her efforts on spurring\r\n    Japan to act immediately. If Japan has Singapore all other East\r\n    Asiatic questions regarding the U. S. A. and England are thereby\r\n    solved (Guam, Philippines, Borneo, Dutch East Indies).\r\n\r\n    “Japan wishes if possible to avoid war against U. S. A. She can\r\n    do so if she determinedly takes Singapore as soon as possible.”\r\n    (_C-152_)\r\n\r\nThe fact clearly appears from these minutes that military staff\r\nconferences had already been held with the Japanese to discuss the\r\nactivation of Japanese military support against the British and to urge\r\ntheir immediate attack on Singapore. Another passage in the record of\r\nthis meeting establishes this:\r\n\r\n    “Japan is indeed making preparations for this action, but\r\n    according to all declarations made by Japanese officers she will\r\n    only carry it out if Germany proceeds to land in England.”\r\n    (_C-152_)\r\n\r\nApparently the Nazis were subsequently able to persuade the Japanese to\r\neliminate this condition precedent to their performance under the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ribbentrop continued to make further efforts to induce the\r\nJapanese to aggression against the British Commonwealth. On 29 March\r\n1941, he met with the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who was then\r\nin Berlin. The following is a report of their conversations, found in\r\nthe German Foreign Office Archives:\r\n\r\n“REPORT ON THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE REICH MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n (RAM) AND THE JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER MATSUOKA IN BERLIN ON 29 MARCH\r\n                                 1941.\r\n\r\n    “The RAM resumed the preceding conversation with Matsuoka about\r\n    the latter’s impending talks with the Russians in Moscow, where\r\n    they had left off. He expressed the opinion, that it would\r\n    probably be best, in view of the whole situation, not to carry\r\n    the discussions with the Russians too far. He did not know how\r\n    the situation would develop. One thing, however, was certain,\r\n    namely, that Germany would strike immediately, should Russia\r\n    ever attack Japan. He was ready to give Matsuoka this positive\r\n    assurance, so that Japan could push forward to the South on\r\n    Singapore, without fear of possible complications with Russia.\r\n    The largest part of the German army was anyway on the Eastern\r\n    frontiers of the Reich, and fully prepared to open the attack at\r\n    any time. He (the RAM), however, believed that Russia would try\r\n    to avoid development leading to war. Should Germany however\r\n    enter into a conflict with Russia, the USSR would be finished\r\n    off within a few months. In this case, Japan had of course even\r\n    less reason to be afraid than ever, if it wants to advance on\r\n    Singapore. Consequently, it need not refrain from such an\r\n    undertaking because of possible fears of Russia.\r\n\r\n    “He could not know of course, just how things with Russia would\r\n    develop. It was uncertain whether or not Stalin would intensify\r\n    his present unfriendly policy against Germany. He (the RAM)\r\n    wanted to point out to Matsuoka, in any case, that a conflict\r\n    with Russia was anyhow within the realm of possibility. In any\r\n    case, Matsuoka could not report to the Japanese Emperor upon his\r\n    return, that a conflict between Russia and Germany was\r\n    impossible. On the contrary, the situation was such, that such a\r\n    conflict, even if it were not probable, would have to be\r\n    considered possible.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Next, the RAM turned again to the Singapore question. In view\r\n    of the fears expressed by the Japanese of possible attacks by\r\n    submarines, based on the Philippines, and of the intervention of\r\n    the British Mediterranean and Home fleets, he had again\r\n    discussed the situation with General-Admiral Raeder. The latter\r\n    had stated that the British Navy during this year would have its\r\n    hands so full in the English home waters and in the\r\n    Mediterranean, that it would not be able to send even a single\r\n    ship to the Far East. General-Admiral Raeder had described the\r\n    U. S. submarines as so bad that Japan need not bother about them\r\n    at all.\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka replied immediately that the Japanese Navy had a very\r\n    low estimate of the threat from the British Navy; it also held\r\n    the view that, in case of a clash with the American Navy, it\r\n    would be able to smash the latter without trouble. However it\r\n    was afraid that the Americans would not take up the battle with\r\n    their fleet; thus the conflict with the United States might\r\n    perhaps be dragged out to five years. This possibility caused\r\n    considerable worry in Japan.\r\n\r\n    “The RAM replied that America could not do anything against\r\n    Japan in the case of the capture of Singapore. Perhaps for this\r\n    reason alone, Roosevelt would think twice before deciding on\r\n    active measures against Japan. For while on one hand he could\r\n    not achieve anything against Japan, on the other hand there was\r\n    the probability of losing the Philippines to Japan; for the\r\n    American president, of course, this would mean a considerable\r\n    loss of prestige, and because of the inadequate rearmament, he\r\n    would have nothing to offset such a loss.\r\n\r\n    “In this connection, Matsuoka pointed out, that he was doing\r\n    everything to reassure the English about Singapore. He acted as\r\n    if Japan had no intention at all regarding this key position of\r\n    England in the East. Therefore it might be possible that his\r\n    attitude toward the British would appear to be friendly in words\r\n    and in acts. However, Germany should not be deceived by that. He\r\n    assumed this attitude not only in order to reassure the British,\r\n    but also in order to fool the pro-British and pro-American\r\n    elements so long, until one day he would suddenly open the\r\n    attack on Singapore.\r\n\r\n    “In this connection, Matsuoka stated that his tactics were based\r\n    on the certain assumption that the sudden attack against\r\n    Singapore would unite the entire Japanese nation with one blow.\r\n    (“Nothing succeeds like success,” the RAM remarked.) He followed\r\n    here the example of the words of a famous Japanese statesman,\r\n    addressed to the Japanese Navy at the outbreak of the\r\n    Russo-Japanese war: “You open fire, then the nation will be\r\n    united.” The Japanese need to be shaken up to awaken. After all,\r\n    as an Oriental, he believed in fate, which would come, whether\r\n    you wanted it or not.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka then introduced the subject of German assistance in\r\n    the blow against Singapore, a subject which had been broached to\r\n    him frequently, and mentioned the proposal of a German written\r\n    promise of assistance.\r\n\r\n    “The RAM replied that he had already discussed these questions\r\n    with Ambassador Oshima. He had asked him to procure maps of\r\n    Singapore in order that the Fuehrer—who probably must be\r\n    considered the greatest expert on military questions at the\r\n    present time—could advise Japan on the best method of attack\r\n    against Singapore. German experts on aerial warfare, too, would\r\n    be at her disposal; they could draw up a report, based on their\r\n    European experiences, for the Japanese on the use of divebombers\r\n    from airfields in the vicinity against the British fleet in\r\n    Singapore. Thus the British fleet would be forced to disappear\r\n    from Singapore immediately.\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka remarked that Japan was less concerned with the\r\n    British fleet, than with the capture of the fortifications.\r\n\r\n    “The RAM replied that here, too, the Fuehrer had developed new\r\n    methods for the German attacks on strongly fortified positions,\r\n    such as the Maginot Line and Fort Eben-Emael, which he could\r\n    make available to the Japanese.\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka replied in this connection that some of the younger,\r\n    expert Japanese naval officers, who were close friends of his,\r\n    were of the opinion that the Japanese naval forces would need\r\n    three months until they could capture Singapore. As a cautious\r\n    Foreign Minister, he had doubled this estimate. He believed he\r\n    could stave off any danger which threatened from America, for\r\n    six months. If, however, the capture of Singapore required still\r\n    more time and if the operations would perhaps even drag out for\r\n    a year, the situation with America would become extremely\r\n    critical and he did not know as yet how to meet it.\r\n\r\n    “If at all avoidable, he would not touch the Netherland East\r\n    Indies, since he was afraid that in case of a Japanese attack on\r\n    this area, the oilfields would be set afire. They could be\r\n    brought into operation again only after 1 or 2 years.\r\n\r\n    “The RAM added that Japan would gain decisive influence over the\r\n    Netherland East Indies simultaneously with the capture of\r\n    Singapore.” (_1877-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 5 April, about a week after the conference just noted, Ribbentrop\r\nagain met with Matsuoka and again pushed the Japanese another step along\r\nthe road to aggressive war. The notes of this conference, which were\r\nalso found in German Foreign Office Archives, reveal the following\r\nexchange:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In answer to a remark by Matsuoka, that Japan was now\r\n    awakening and, according to the Japanese temperament, would take\r\n    action quickly after the previous lengthy deliberation, the\r\n    Reich Foreign Minister replied that it was necessary, of course,\r\n    to accept a certain risk in this connection, just as the Fuehrer\r\n    had done so successfully with the occupation of the Rhineland,\r\n    with the proclamation of sovereignty of armament, and with the\r\n    resignation from the League of Nations.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Foreign Minister replied that the new German Reich\r\n    would actually be built up on the basis of the ancient\r\n    traditions of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which\r\n    in its time was the only dominant power on the European\r\n    Continent.\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion the Reich Foreign Minister once again summarized\r\n    the points he wanted Matsuoka to take back to Japan with him\r\n    from his trip:\r\n\r\n    “1. Germany had already won the war. With the end of this year\r\n    the world would realize this. Even England would have to concede\r\n    it, if it had not collapsed before then, and America would also\r\n    have to resign herself to this fact.\r\n\r\n    “2. There were no conflicting interests between Japan and\r\n    Germany. The future of both countries could be regulated for the\r\n    long run on the basis that Japan should predominate in the Far\r\n    East, Italy and Germany in Europe and Africa.\r\n\r\n    “3. Whatever might happen, Germany would win the war. But it\r\n    would hasten victory if Japan would enter the war. Such an entry\r\n    into the war was undoubtedly more in the interest of Japan than\r\n    in that of Germany, for it offered a unique opportunity which\r\n    would hardly ever return, for the fulfillment of the national\r\n    objectives of Japan, a chance which would make it possible for\r\n    her to play a really leading role in East Asia.” (_1882-PS_)\r\n\r\nHere again, in the portions just quoted, Ribbentrop is seen pursuing the\r\nsame tack previously noted: Germany has already won the war for all\r\npractical purposes. Japan’s entry will hasten the inevitable end. _And_\r\nJapan had better get the positions she wants _during_ the war.\r\nRibbentrop’s assurances, (_1877-PS_) that Japan likewise had nothing to\r\nfear from the Soviet Union if Japan entered the conflict, and his\r\ncontinual references to the weakness of the United States scattered\r\nthroughout his conversations, were other means used to hurry along the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Nazi methods is shown in a top secret report, dated\r\n24 May 1941, from the German Military Attache in Tokyo to the\r\nIntelligence Division of the OKW. The last sentence in paragraph 1,\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “The preparations for attack on Singapore and Manila stand.”\r\n    (_1538-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe fact appears from this sentence that the German military were\r\nkeeping in close touch with the Japanese operational plans against\r\nSingapore, which the Nazi conspirators had fostered.\r\n\r\n(2) _Exhortations to Japanese Aggression Against the U.S.S.R._\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators also directed their efforts to induce a Japanese\r\n“stab in the back” against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Here\r\nagain Ribbentrop appears as a central figure.\r\n\r\nFor some months prior to the issuance of Basic Order No. 24 regarding\r\ncollaboration with Japan (_C-75_), the Nazi conspirators had been\r\npreparing “_Fall Barbarossa_”, the plan for attack on the U.S.S.R. Basic\r\nOrder No. 24 decreed, however, that the Japanese “must not be given any\r\nintimation of the Barbarossa operation”. (_C-75_)\r\n\r\nIn his conference with the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on 29\r\nMarch 1941, almost 3 weeks after the issuance of Basic Order No. 24,\r\nRibbentrop nevertheless hinted at things to come. Ribbentrop assured\r\nMatsuoka that the largest part of the German Army was on the Eastern\r\nfrontiers of the Reich fully prepared to open the attack at any time.\r\nRibbentrop then added that, although he believed that the U.S.S.R. would\r\ntry to avoid developments leading to war, nevertheless a conflict with\r\nthe Soviet Union, even if not probable, would have to be considered\r\npossible. (_1877-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhatever conclusions the Japanese Ambassador drew from these remarks in\r\nApril 1941 can only be conjectured. Once the Nazis had unleashed their\r\naggression against the U.S.S.R. in June of 1941, the tenor of\r\nRibbentrop’s remarks left no room for doubt. On 10 July 1941, Ribbentrop\r\ndespatched a coded telegram to Ott, the German Ambassador in Tokyo\r\n(_2896-PS_). Pertinent passages in that telegram read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Please take this opportunity to thank the Japanese Ambassador\r\n    in Moscow for conveying the cable report. It would be convenient\r\n    if we could keep on receiving news from Russia this way. In\r\n    summing up, I would like to say: I have now, as in the past,\r\n    full confidence in the Japanese Policy, and in the Japanese\r\n    Foreign Minister, first of all because the present Japanese\r\n    government would really act inexcusably toward the future of its\r\n    nation if it would not take this unique opportunity to solve the\r\n    Russian problem, as well as to secure for all time its expansion\r\n    to the South and settle the Chinese matter. Since Russia, as\r\n    reported by the Japanese Ambassador in Moscow, is in effect\r\n    close to collapse, a report which coincides with our own\r\n    observations as far as we are able to judge at the present war\r\n    situation, it is simply impossible that Japan does not solve the\r\n    matter of Vladivostok and the Siberian area as soon as her\r\n    military preparations are completed.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “However, I ask you to employ all available means in further\r\n    insisting upon Japan’s entry into the war against Russia at the\r\n    soonest possible date, as I have mentioned already in my note to\r\n    Matsuoka. The sooner this entry is effected, the better it is.\r\n    The natural objective still remains that we and Japan join hands\r\n    on the Trans-Siberian railroad, before winter starts. After the\r\n    collapse of Russia, however, the position of the Three Power\r\n    Pact states in the world will be so gigantic, that the question\r\n    of England’s collapse or the total destruction of the English\r\n    islands, respectively, will only be a matter of time. An America\r\n    totally isolated from the rest of the world would then be faced\r\n    with our taking possession of the remaining positions of the\r\n    British Empire which are important for the Three Power Pact\r\n    countries. I have the unshakable conviction that a carrying\r\n    through of the new order as desired by us will be a matter of\r\n    course, and there would be no insurmountable difficulties if the\r\n    countries of the Three Power Pact stand close together and\r\n    encounter every action of the Americans with the same weapons. I\r\n    ask you to report in the near future as often as possible and in\r\n    detail on the political situation there.” (_2896-PS_)\r\n\r\nOtt’s reply to this telegram (_2897-PS_), dated 13 July 1941, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                                          “Telegram\r\n                                             (Secret Cipher System)\r\n    “Tokyo   14 July 1941  0230 hrs.\r\n    Arrived  14 July 1941  1120 hrs.\r\n                                               As fast as possible!\r\n    “#1217 dated 13.7\r\n    for Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n    Answer to telegram 10, #108 Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\n    Arrived Tokyo 12 July 1941\r\n\r\n    “I am trying with all means to work toward Japan’s entry into\r\n    the war against Russia as soon as possible.

I believe that, according to military\r\n    preparations, Japanese participation will soon take place. The\r\n    greatest obstacles against which one has to fight thereby is the\r\n    disunity among Activist groups which, without unified command,\r\n    follows various aims and only slowly adjusts itself to the\r\n    changed situation.\r\n\r\n                                                 Ott.”  (_2897-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn subsequent occasions Ribbentrop repeated his exhortations to induce\r\nthe Japanese to aggression against the U.S.S.R. Three documents,\r\ncovering July of 1942 and March and April of 1943, record these\r\nexhortations.\r\n\r\nThe first discussion occurred between Ribbentrop and Oshima, Japanese\r\nAmbassador to Berlin, on 9 July 1942. As a matter of background, it may\r\nbe noted that at that time German armies were sweeping forward in the\r\nU.S.S.R. and the fall of Sevastapol had just been announced. The\r\ndiscussion proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Notes concerning the discussion between the Minister for\r\n    Foreign Affairs and Ambassador Oshima at Steinort, on 9 July\r\n    1942._\r\n\r\n    “He, the German Foreign Minister, had asked to see the\r\n    Ambassador at this time when the situation was as described,\r\n    because now a question of fateful importance had arisen\r\n    concerning the joint conduct of the war: if Japan felt itself\r\n    sufficiently strong militarily, the moment for Japan to attack\r\n    Russia was probably now. He thought it possible that, if Japan\r\n    attacked Russia now, it would lead to her (Russia’s) final moral\r\n    collapse; at least it would hasten the collapse of her present\r\n    system. In any case, never again would Japan have such an\r\n    opportunity as existed at present, to eliminate once and for all\r\n    the Russian colossus in Eastern Asia. He had discussed this\r\n    question with the Fuehrer, and the Fuehrer was of the same\r\n    opinion, but he wanted to emphasize one point right away: Japan\r\n    should attack Russia only if she felt sufficiently strong for\r\n    such an undertaking. Under no circumstances should Japanese\r\n    operations against Russia be allowed to bog down at the halfway\r\n    mark, and we do not want to urge Japan into an action that is\r\n    not mutually profitable.” (_2911-PS_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop and Ambassador Oshima had another conference on 6 March 1943.\r\nIt is noted, again for background, that the strategic military situation\r\nin the broad expanses of the U.S.S.R. had changed somewhat. In the\r\nprevious month, February 1943, the Soviet Armies had completely defeated\r\nthe German forces at Stalingrad and inflicted severe losses. To the\r\nnorth and west their winter offensive had recovered large areas from the\r\nhands of the invaders. In addition, combined U. S. and British forces\r\nhad already landed in North Africa. The tone of Ribbentrop’s argument\r\nreflects the changed military situation. The familiar Japanese refrain\r\nof “so sorry please” likewise appears to have crept in. It is noted, in\r\nthis regard, that the month of February 1943 had also seen the end of\r\norganized Japanese resistance on the island of Guadalcanal. The\r\nconference went as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Ambassador Oshima declared that he had received a telegram from\r\n    Tokyo, and he is to report by order of his government to the\r\n    Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs (RAM) the following: The\r\n    suggestion of the German Government, to attack Russia, was the\r\n    subject of a common conference between the Japanese Government\r\n    and the Imperial headquarters, during which the question was\r\n    discussed in detail and investigated exactly. The result is the\r\n    following: the Japanese Government absolutely recognizes the\r\n    danger which threatens from Russia, and completely understands\r\n    the desire of its German ally that Japan on her part will also\r\n    enter the war against Russia. However, it is not possible for\r\n    the Japanese Government, considering the present war situation,\r\n    to enter into the war. It is rather of the conviction that it\r\n    would be in the common interest not to start the war against\r\n    Russia now. On the other hand, the Japanese Government would\r\n    never disregard the Russian question.\r\n\r\n    “The Japanese Government has the intention to become aggressive\r\n    again in the future on other fronts.\r\n\r\n    “The RAM brought up the question, after the explanation by the\r\n    Ambassador, of how the continued waging of the war is envisaged\r\n    in Tokyo. At present, Germany wages the war against the common\r\n    enemies, England and America, mostly alone, while Japan mostly\r\n    behaves more defensively. However, it would be more correct that\r\n    all powers allied in the Three Power Pact would combine their\r\n    forces to defeat England and America, but also Russia together.\r\n    It is not good when one part must fight alone. One cannot\r\n    overstrain the German national strength. He has worried silently\r\n    that certain forces work in Tokyo, who are of the opinion and\r\n    who propagate it, that Germany would come through the fight\r\n    victoriously, and that therefore Japan should consolidate itself\r\n    further at first, before it makes further and utmost efforts.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Then the RAM again brought up the question of the attack on\r\n    Russia by Japan, and he declared that after all, the fight on\r\n    the Burma front as well as in the South is actually more of a\r\n    maritime problem, and on all fronts—except those in\r\n    China—there are mostly very few ground forces committed.\r\n    Therefore the attack on Russia is primarily an army affair, and\r\n    he asked himself whether the necessary forces would not be ready\r\n    for that”. (_2954-PS_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop kept on trying. He held another conference with Oshima about\r\nthree weeks later, on 18 April 1943. The top secret notes of this\r\nconference reveal the following:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichminister for Foreign Affairs then stressed again that\r\n    without any doubt this year presented the most favorable\r\n    opportunity for Japan, if she felt strong enough and had\r\n    sufficient anti-tank weapons at her disposal, to attack Russia,\r\n    which certainly would never again be as weak as she is at the\r\n    moment.” (_2929-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Nazi Preparations and Collaboration with the Japanese Against the\r\nUnited States._ The Nazi preparations and collaboration with the\r\nJapanese against the United States present a twofold aspect: one of\r\npreparations by the Nazis themselves for attack from across the\r\nAtlantic; the other of the fomenting of war in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn the previous discussion of the Nazi exhortations to the Japanese to\r\nwar against the British Commonwealth and the U.S.S.R., reference has\r\nbeen made to certain documents relating to the United States. Those\r\ndocuments will be taken up again, in their relevant passages, to show\r\ntheir particular application. In the treatment of Ribbentrop’s urging\r\nthe Japanese to war against the U.S.S.R., documents have been introduced\r\nchronicling conferences which took place after the dates of 7 December\r\nand 11 December 1941 when the Japanese and German Governments,\r\nrespectively, initiated and declared aggressive war against the United\r\nStates. These documents have indicated that Nazi awareness and\r\nacceptance of the direction in which their actions were leading, as well\r\nas the universal aspects of their conspiracy and of their alliance with\r\nthe Japanese.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Preliminary Nazi Preparations Against the United States._ The\r\nNazi conspirators’ intentions against the United States must be viewed\r\nin the focus of both their over-all plan and their immediate commitments\r\nelsewhere. That their over-all plan involved ultimate aggressive war\r\nagainst the United States was intimated by Goering in a speech on 8 July\r\n1938, when the Nazi conspirators had already forcibly annexed Austria\r\nand were perfecting their plans for occupation of Czechoslovakia. This\r\nspeech was delivered to representatives of the aircraft industry and the\r\ncopy which the prosecution has obtained was transmitted as the enclosure\r\nto a secret memorandum from Goering’s adjutant to General Udet, who was\r\nthen in charge of experimental research for the Luftwaffe (_R-140_). The\r\nstatement in the covering memorandum notes that the enclosure is a “copy\r\nof the shorthand minutes of the conference”. In the course of his long\r\nspeech, Goering called for increased aircraft production and referred to\r\nthe necessity for full mobilization of German industrial capacity. He\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n    “I still am missing entirely the bomber which flies with 5 tons\r\n    of explosives as far as New York and back. I should be extremely\r\n    happy to have such a bomber so that I would at last be able to\r\n    stop somewhat the mouth of the arrogant people over there.”\r\n    (_R-140_)\r\n\r\nGoering’s fervent hope, of course, was not capable of realization at\r\nthat time, either technically or in the face of the Nazi conspirators’\r\nschedule of aggression that has already been outlined. During the period\r\nof their preparation for and waging of aggressive war in Europe, up\r\nthrough the launching of the campaign against the U.S.S.R., it is only\r\nreasonable to believe that the Nazi conspirators were not disposed to\r\ninvolve the United States in war—_at that time_.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even in the fall of 1940, the prosecution of war against\r\nthe United States of America at a later date was on the military agenda.\r\nThis is clearly shown in a document which was found in the files of the\r\nOKL, the German Air Force (_376-PS_). This memorandum is marked\r\n“_Chefsache_”—the German designation for Top Secret—and is directed\r\nfrom a Major von Falkenstein to an unspecified General, presumably a\r\nLuftwaffe General. Falkenstein, who was a Major of the General Staff,\r\nwas at that time the Luftwaffe Liaison Officer with the Operations Staff\r\nof the OKW, which was the staff headed by Jodl. His memorandum, which he\r\ncharacterizes as a “brief resumé of the military questions current\r\nhere”, is dated 29 October 1940. It covers several questions. Paragraph\r\n5 states:\r\n\r\n    “5. The Fuehrer is at present occupied with the question of the\r\n    occupation of the Atlantic Islands with a view to the\r\n    prosecution of war against America at a later date.\r\n    Deliberations on this subject are being embarked upon here.\r\n    Essential conditions are at the present:—\r\n\r\n    “a. No operational commitment\r\n\r\n    “b. Portuguese neutrality\r\n\r\n    “c. Support of France and Spain\r\n\r\n    “A brief assessment of the possibility of seizing and holding\r\n    air bases and of the question of supply is needed from the GAF.\r\n\r\n    “Major Queisner will fetch the documents for himself from Ic\r\n    Kurfurst (C. in C. GAF Rear Hq.). I would like to ask Colonel\r\n    Schmidt to arrange that he be supplied with the information he\r\n    desires.” (_376-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Military interest in the United States is further indicated by\r\nparagraph 7:\r\n\r\n    “7. General von Boetticher has made repeated reference,\r\n    especially in his telegram 2314 dated 26/10, to the fact that in\r\n    his opinion too many details of our knowledge of American\r\n    aircraft industry are being published in the German press. The\r\n    matter has been discussed at Armed Forces Supreme Command. I\r\n    pointed out that the matter was a specifically GAF one, but have\r\n    taken the liberty of referring the matter to you on its own\r\n    merits.” (_376-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain in July 1941, in his first flush of confidence resulting from\r\nearly gains in the aggression against the U.S.S.R., the Fuehrer signed\r\nan order for further preliminary preparations for the attack on the\r\nUnited States. This top secret order, found in files of the German Navy,\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    “By virtue of the intentions announced in Directive No. 32, for\r\n    the further conduct of the War, I lay down the following\r\n    principles to govern the strength of personnel and of material\r\n    supplies:\r\n\r\n    “1. _In general_: The military domination of Europe after the\r\n    defeat of Russia will enable the strength of the _Army_ to be\r\n    considerably reduced in the near future. As far as the reduced\r\n    strength of the Army will allow, the Armoured units will be\r\n    greatly increased.\r\n\r\n    “_Naval_ armament must be restricted to those measures which\r\n    have a direct connection with the conduct of the war against\r\n    England and, should the case arise, against America. “The main\r\n    effort in armament will be shifted to the _Air Force_, which\r\n    must be greatly increased in strength.” (_C-74_)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Collaboration with the Japanese Against the United States._ From\r\nthe documents just quoted, it appears that the Nazi conspirators were\r\nmaking at least preliminary military plans of their own against the\r\nUnited States. The Nazi over-all plan with regard to the United States,\r\nhowever, was a complex one, involving in addition collaboration with the\r\nJapanese. In the course of their repeated representations to the\r\nJapanese to undertake an assault against British possessions in the\r\nPacific-Far East, they again considered war against the United States.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in Basic Order No. 24 regarding collaboration\r\nwith the Japanese (_C-75_), which was issued on 5 March 1941, the Nazi\r\npolicy was stated in subparagraph 3_a_ as aiming at “forcing England to\r\nthe ground quickly and thereby keeping the United States out of the\r\nwar”. Nevertheless the Nazi conspirators clearly contemplated within the\r\nframework of that policy the possibility of the United States’ entry\r\ninto the Far Eastern conflict which the Nazis were instigating. This\r\ncould result from an attack by Japan on United States’ possessions\r\npractically simultaneously with the assault on the British Empire (as\r\nactually happened). Other possibilities of involvement of the United\r\nStates were also discussed. Thus, Basic Order No. 24 stated in\r\nsubparagraph 3 (_c_):\r\n\r\n    “_c. The raw material situation of the pact powers_ demands that\r\n    Japan should acquire possession of those territories which it\r\n    needs for the continuation of the war, especially if the United\r\n    States intervenes. Rubber shipments must be carried out even\r\n    after the entry of Japan into the war, since they are of vital\r\n    importance to Germany.” (_C-75_)\r\n\r\nThe order continues, in the unnumbered paragraph immediately below\r\nsubparagraph 3 (_d_):\r\n\r\n    “In addition, attacks on other systems of bases of British naval\r\n    power—extending to those of American naval power only if the\r\n    entry of the United States into the war cannot be\r\n    prevented—will result in weakening the enemy’s system of power\r\n    in that region and also, just like the attack on sea\r\n    communications, in tying down substantial forces of all kinds\r\n    (Australia).” (_C-75_)\r\n\r\nIn these passages there is a clear envisionment of U.S. involvement, as\r\nwell as a clear intent to attack. The vital threat to United States’\r\ninterests if Japan were to capture Singapore was also clearly envisaged\r\nby Raeder in his meeting of March 1941 with Hitler, Keitel, and Jodl, in\r\nwhich he stated:\r\n\r\n    “Japan must take steps to seize Singapore as soon as possible,\r\n    since the opportunity will never again be as favourable (whole\r\n    English Fleet contained: unpreparedness of U.S.A. for war\r\n    against Japan: inferiority of U.S. Fleet vis-a-vis the\r\n    Japanese). Japan is indeed making preparations for this action,\r\n    but according to all declarations made by Japanese officers she\r\n    will only carry it out if Germany proceeds to land in England.\r\n    Germany must therefore concentrate all her efforts on spurring\r\n    Japan to act immediately. If Japan has Singapore all other East\r\n    Asiatic questions regarding the U.S.A. and England are thereby\r\n    solved (Guam, Philippines, Borneo, Dutch East Indies).\r\n\r\n    “Japan wishes if possible to avoid war against U.S.A. She can do\r\n    so if she determinedly takes Singapore as soon as possible.”\r\n    (_C-152_)\r\n\r\nRibbentrop also recognized the possibility of U.S. involvement as a\r\nresult of the course of aggression that he was urging on the Japanese.\r\nIn his meeting of 23 February 1941 with the Japanese Ambassador Oshima,\r\nthe notes of which are contained in (_1834-PS_), Ribbentrop assured\r\nMatsuoka that a surprise intervention by Japan was bound to keep the\r\nUnited States out of the war since she was unarmed and could not risk\r\neither her fleet or the possibility of losing the Philippines as the\r\nresult of a declaration of war. Two paragraphs later, Ribbentrop\r\npractically dropped the pretense that the United States would not be\r\ninvolved:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Foreign Minister mentioned further that, if America\r\n    should declare war because of Japan’s entry into the war, this\r\n    would mean that America had had the intention to enter the war\r\n    sooner or later anyway. Even though it would be preferable to\r\n    avoid this, the entry into the war would, as explained above, be\r\n    by no means decisive and would not endanger the final victory of\r\n    the countries of the Three-Power Pact. The Foreign Minister\r\n    further expressed his belief that a temporary lift of the\r\n    British morale caused by America’s entry into the war would be\r\n    cancelled by Japan’s entry into the war. If, however, contrary\r\n    to all expectations, the Americans should be careless enough to\r\n    send their Navy, in spite of all, beyond Hawaii and to the Far\r\n    East, this would represent the biggest chance for the countries\r\n    of the Three-Power Pact to bring the war rapidly to an end. He,\r\n    the Foreign Minister, is convinced that the Japanese fleet would\r\n    then do a complete job. Ambassador Oshima replied to this that\r\n    unfortunately he does not think the Americans would do it, but\r\n    he is convinced of a victory of his fleet in Japanese waters.”\r\n    (_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the paragraphs that follow, Ribbentrop again stresses the mutual\r\ninterdependence of the Tripartite Pact powers and suggests coordinated\r\naction. He indulged in a typical bit of Nazi cynicism:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich Foreign Minister then touched upon the question,\r\n    explicitly pointed out as theoretical, that the contracting\r\n    powers might be required, on the basis of new affronts by the\r\n    U.S.A., to break off diplomatic relations. Germany and Italy\r\n    were fundamentally determined on this; after signing of the\r\n    Three-Power Pact we should proceed if the occasion arises, but\r\n    also jointly in this matter. Such a lesson should open the eyes\r\n    of the people in the U.S.A. to the situation and under certain\r\n    conditions bring about a swing toward isolation in public\r\n    opinion. Naturally a situation had to be chosen in which America\r\n    found herself entirely in the wrong. The common step of the\r\n    signatory powers should be exploited correspondingly in\r\n    propaganda. The question, however, was in no way acute at the\r\n    time.” (_1834-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain on 29 March 1941, Ribbentrop—this time in a conference with the\r\nJapanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka—discussed the possible involvement\r\nof the United States. (_1877-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators knew that the aggressive war they were urging the\r\nJapanese to undertake both threatened the vital interests of the United\r\nStates and could lead the U.S. to involvement in the contemplated Far\r\nEastern conflict. This fact is clear from the report of the conference\r\nbetween Hitler and the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Berlin on 4\r\nApril 1941 (_1881-PS_). The report states, in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Matsuoka then also expressed the request that the Fuehrer\r\n    should instruct the proper authorities in Germany to meet as\r\n    broad-mindedly as possible the wishes of the Japanese Military\r\n    Commission. Japan was in need of German help particularly\r\n    concerning the U-boat warfare, which could be given by making\r\n    available to them the latest experiences of the war as well as\r\n    the latest technical improvements and inventions. Japan would do\r\n    her utmost to avoid a war with the United States. In case that\r\n    the country should decide to attack Singapore, the Japanese\r\n    Navy, of course, had to be prepared for a fight with the United\r\n    States, because in that case America probably would side with\r\n    Great Britain. He (Matsuoka) personally believed that the United\r\n    States would be restrained by diplomatic exertions from entering\r\n    the war at the side of Great Britain. The Army and Navy had,\r\n    however, to count on the worst situation, that is, with war\r\n    against America. They were of the opinion that such a war would\r\n    extend for five years or longer and would take the form of\r\n    guerrilla warfare in the Pacific and would be fought out in the\r\n    South Sea. For this reason the German experiences in her\r\n    guerrilla warfare are of the greatest value to Japan. It was a\r\n    question how such a war would best be conducted and how all the\r\n    technical improvements of submarines, in all details such as\r\n    periscopes and such like, could best be exploited by Japan.\r\n\r\n    “To sum up, Matsuoka requested that the Fuehrer should see to it\r\n    that the proper German authorities would place at the disposal\r\n    of the Japanese those developments and inventions concerning\r\n    Navy and Army, which were needed by the Japanese.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer promised this and pointed out that Germany too\r\n    considered a conflict with the United States undesirable, but\r\n    that it had already made allowances for such a contingency.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Matsuoka once more repeated his request that the Fuehrer might\r\n    give the necessary instructions, in order that the proper German\r\n    authorities would place at the disposal of the Japanese the\r\n    latest improvement and inventions, which are of interest to\r\n    them, because the Japanese Navy had to prepare immediately for a\r\n    conflict with the United States.\r\n\r\n    “As regards Japanese-American relationship, Matsuoka explained\r\n    further that he has always declared in his country that sooner\r\n    or later a war with the United States would be unavoidable, if\r\n    Japan continued to drift along as at present. In his opinion\r\n    this conflict would happen rather sooner than later. His\r\n    argumentation went on, why should Japan, therefore, not\r\n    decisively strike at the right moment and take the risk upon\r\n    herself of a fight against America?” (_1881-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe passages just quoted show not only a realization of the probable\r\ninvolvement of the United States in the Far Eastern conflict that the\r\nNazis were urging, but also a knowledge on their part that the Japanese\r\nArmy and Navy were actually preparing war plans against the United\r\nStates. Furthermore, the Nazis knew at least a part of what those war\r\nplans were. This fact is revealed in a secret telegram from the German\r\nmilitary-attache in Tokyo, dated 24 May 1941 (_1538-PS_). The attache\r\nreports the conferences he has had regarding Japan’s entry in the war in\r\nthe event Germany should become involved in war with the United States.\r\nIn paragraph 1, this sentence appears:\r\n\r\n    “Preparations for attack on Singapore and Manila stand.”\r\n    (_1538-PS_).\r\n\r\nA review of the Nazi position with regard to the United States at this\r\npoint, the Spring of 1941, shows that in view of their press of\r\ncommitments elsewhere and their aggressive plans against the U.S.S.R.,\r\nset for execution in June of 1941, their temporary strategy was\r\nnaturally a preference that the United States not be involved in war at\r\nthat time. Nevertheless they had been considering their own preliminary\r\nplans against the United States, as seen in the Atlantic Islands\r\ndocument (_376-PS_). They were repeatedly urging the Japanese to\r\naggression against the British Commonwealth, just as they would urge\r\nthem to attack the U.S.S.R. soon after the launching of the Nazi\r\ninvasion. They were aware that the course along which they were pushing\r\nthe Japanese in the Far East would probably lead to involvement of the\r\nUnited States. Indeed, the Japanese Foreign Minister had told Hitler\r\nthis in so many words, and their own military men had fully realized the\r\nimplications of the move against Singapore. They knew also that the\r\nJapanese Army and Navy were preparing operational plans against the\r\nUnited States. They knew at least part of those plans.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators not only knew all these things. They accepted the\r\nrisk of the aggressive course they were urging on the Japanese and\r\npushed their Eastern allies still farther along that course. On 4 April\r\n1941, Hitler told the Japanese Foreign Minister that in the event Japan\r\nwere to become involved in war with the United States, Germany would\r\nimmediately take the consequences and strike without delay. The\r\nfollowing is a passage from the notes of the Hitler-Matsuoka conference\r\nin Berlin on 4 April 1941:\r\n\r\n    “In the further course of the discussion the Fuehrer pointed out\r\n    that Germany on her part would immediately take the\r\n    consequences, if Japan would get involved with the United\r\n    States. It did not matter with whom the United States would\r\n    first get involved, if with Germany or with Japan. They would\r\n    always try to eliminate one country at a time, not to come to an\r\n    understanding with the other country subsequently, but to\r\n    liquidate this one just the same. Therefore Germany would\r\n    strike, as already mentioned, without delay in case of a\r\n    conflict between Japan and America, because the strength of the\r\n    tripartite powers lies in their joined action. Their weakness\r\n    would be if they would let themselves be beaten individually.”\r\n    (_1881-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler then encouraged Matsuoka in his decision to strike against the\r\nUnited States:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer replied that he could well understand the situation\r\n    of Matsuoka, because he himself was in similar situations (the\r\n    clearing of the Rhineland, declaration of sovereignty of armed\r\n    Forces). He too was of the opinion that he had to exploit\r\n    favorable conditions and accept the risk of an anyhow\r\n    unavoidable fight at a time when he himself was still young and\r\n    full of vigor. How right he was in his attitude was proven by\r\n    events. Europe now was free. He would not hesitate a moment to\r\n    instantly reply to any widening of the war, be it by Russia, be\r\n    it by America. Providence favored those who will not let dangers\r\n    come to them, but who will bravely face them.” (_1881-PS_)\r\n\r\nHere, in the passages just quoted, were assurance, encouragement, and\r\nabetment by the head of the German State, the leading Nazi\r\nco-conspirator, in April 1941. But the Nazi encouragement and promise of\r\nsupport did not end there. Another telegram from the German Ambassador\r\nin Tokyo regarding conversations with the Japanese Foreign Minister,\r\ndated 30 November 1941, one week before Pearl Harbor, read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The progress of the negotiations so far confirms his viewpoint\r\n    that the difference of opinion between Japan and the U.S. is\r\n    very great. The Japanese Government since it sent Ambassador\r\n    Kurusu has taken a firm stand, as he told me. He is convinced\r\n    that this position is in our favor and makes the United States\r\n    think that her entry into the European war would be risky\r\n    business. The new American proposal of 25 November showed great\r\n    divergences in the viewpoints of the two nations. These\r\n    differences of opinion concern, for example, the further\r\n    treatment of the Chinese question. The biggest (one word\r\n    missing) however resulted from the U. S. attempt to make the\r\n    three-power agreement ineffective. U. S. suggested to Japan to\r\n    conclude treaties of nonaggression with the U. S., the British\r\n    Empire, the Soviet Union, and other countries in order to\r\n    prevent Japan’s entry into the war on the side of the Axis\r\n    powers. Japan, however, insisted upon maintaining her treaty\r\n    obligations and for this reason American demands are the\r\n    greatest obstacles for adjusting Japanese-American relations. He\r\n    avoided discussing concessions promised by the U. S. and merely\r\n    mentioned that grave decisions were at stake. “The U.S. is\r\n    seriously preparing for war and is about to operate a\r\n    considerable part of its fleet from Southern Pacific bases. The\r\n    Japanese Government is busy working out an answer in order to\r\n    clarify its viewpoint. But he has no particulars at that moment.\r\n    He thinks the American proposals, as a whole, unacceptable.\r\n\r\n    “Japan is not afraid of a breakdown of negotiations and she\r\n    hopes that in that case Germany and Italy, according to the\r\n    Three Power Agreement, would stand at her side. I answered that\r\n    there could be no doubt about Germany’s future position. The\r\n    Japanese Foreign Minister thereupon stated that he understood\r\n    from my words that Germany in such a case would consider her\r\n    relationship to Japan as that of a community of fate. I\r\n    answered, according to my opinion, Germany was certainly ready\r\n    to have mutual agreement between the two countries over this\r\n    situation.\r\n\r\n    “Minister of Foreign Affairs answered that it was possible that\r\n    he would come back to this point soon. The conversation with the\r\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed the impression that the U.\r\n    S. note, in fact, is very unsatisfactory even for the\r\n    compromise-seeking politicians here. For these circles America’s\r\n    position, especially in the China question, is very\r\n    disappointing. The emphasis upon the Three Power Pact as being\r\n    the main obstacle between successful Japanese-U. S. negotiations\r\n    seems to point to the fact that the Japanese Government is\r\n    becoming aware of the necessity of close cooperation with the\r\n    Axis powers.” (_2898-PS_)\r\n\r\nExtracts from the handwritten diary of Count Galleazzo Ciano during the\r\nperiod 3 December to 8 December 1941 fill in the picture (_2987-PS_).\r\nThese are taken from notes which Ciano jotted down in the course of his\r\ndaily business as Foreign Minister of Italy. The entries for 3, 4, and 5\r\nDecember read:\r\n\r\n    “_December 3._\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday_\r\n\r\n    “Sensational move by Japan. The Ambassador asks for an audience\r\n    with the Duce and reads him a long statement on the progress of\r\n    the negotiations with America, concluding with the assertion\r\n    that they have reached a dead end. Then, invoking the\r\n    appropriate clause in the Tripartite Pact, he asks that Italy\r\n    declare war on America immediately after the outbreak of\r\n    hostilities and proposes the signature of an agreement not to\r\n    conclude a separate peace. The interpreter translating this\r\n    request was trembling like a leaf. The Duce gave fullest\r\n    assurances, reserving the right to confer with Berlin before\r\n    giving a reply. The Duce was pleased with the communication and\r\n    said: “We are now on the brink of the inter-continental war\r\n    which I predicted as early as September 1939.” What does this\r\n    new event mean? In any case, it means that Roosevelt has\r\n    succeeded in his maneuver. Since he could not enter into the war\r\n    immediately and directly, he has entered it indirectly by\r\n    letting himself be attacked by Japan. Furthermore, this event\r\n    also means that every prospect of peace is becoming further and\r\n    further removed, and that it is now easy—much too easy—to\r\n    predict a long war. Who will be able to hold out longest? It is\r\n    on this basis that the problem must be considered. Berlin’s\r\n    answer will be somewhat delayed, because Hitler has gone to the\r\n    southern front to see General Kleist, whose armies continue to\r\n    give way under the pressure of an unexpected Soviet offensive.\r\n\r\n    “_December 4._\r\n\r\n    _Thursday_\r\n\r\n    “Berlin’s reaction to the Japanese move is extremely cautious.\r\n    Perhaps they will accept because they cannot get out of it, but\r\n    the idea of provoking America’s intervention pleases the Germans\r\n    less and less. Mussolini, on the other hand, is pleased about\r\n    it. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “_December 5._\r\n\r\n    _Friday_\r\n\r\n    “A night interrupted by Ribbentrop’s restlessness. After\r\n    delaying two days, now he cannot wait a minute to answer the\r\n    Japanese and at three in the morning he sent Mackenson to my\r\n    house to submit a plan for a triple agreement relative to\r\n    Japanese intervention and the pledge not to make a separate\r\n    peace. He wanted me to awaken the Duce, but I did not do so, and\r\n    the latter was very glad I hadn’t * * *.” (_2987-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt appears from the last entry that some sort of agreement was reached.\r\nOn Sunday, 7 December 1941, Japan without previous warning or\r\ndeclaration of war commenced an attack against the United States at\r\nPearl Harbor and against the British Commonwealth of Nations in the\r\nSouthwest Pacific. On the morning of 11 December, four days after the\r\nJapanese assault in the Pacific, the German Government declared war on\r\nthe United States. (_2507-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe same day, 11 December 1941, the Congress of the United States\r\nresolved that “the state of war between the United States and the\r\nGovernment of Germany which has thus been thrust upon the United States\r\nis hereby formally declared”. (_2945-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that, apart from their own aggressive intentions and\r\ndeclaration of war against the United States, the Nazi conspirators in\r\ntheir collaboration with Japan incited and kept in motion a force\r\nreasonably calculated to result in an attack on the United States. While\r\nmaintaining their preference that the United States not be involved in\r\nthe war at the time, they nevertheless foresaw the distinct possibility,\r\neven probability of such involvement as a result of the actions they\r\nwere encouraging; they were aware that the Japanese had prepared plans\r\nfor attack against the United States; and they accepted the consequences\r\nby assuring the Japanese that they would declare war on the United\r\nStates should a U.S.-Japanese conflict result. In dealing with captured\r\ndocuments of the enemy, the completeness of the plan is necessarily\r\nobscured. But those documents which have been discovered, and introduced\r\ninto evidence before the Tribunal, show that the Japanese attack was the\r\nproximate and foreseeable consequence of their collaboration policy, and\r\nthat their exhortations and encouragement of the Japanese as surely led\r\nto Pearl Harbor as though Pearl Harbor itself had been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe entry in the Ciano Diary for 8 December 1941 gives an interesting\r\nsidelight on Ribbentrop’s reaction to the Japanese sneak attack:\r\n\r\n    “_December 8._\r\n\r\n    _Monday._\r\n\r\n    “A night telephone call from Ribbentrop; he is overjoyed about\r\n    the Japanese attack on America. He is so happy about it that I\r\n    am happy with him, though I am not too sure about the final\r\n    advantages of what has happened. One thing is now certain: that\r\n    America will enter the conflict, and that the conflict will be\r\n    so long that she will be able to realize all her potential\r\n    force. This morning I told this to the King who had been pleased\r\n    about the event. He ended by admitting that in the “long run” I\r\n    may be right. Mussolini was happy too. For a long time he has\r\n    favored a definite clarification of relations between America\r\n    and the Axis.” (_2987-PS_)\r\n\r\nA conference was held between Hitler and Japanese Ambassador Oshima on\r\n14 December 1941, from 1300 to 1400 hours, in the presence of the Reich\r\nForeign Minister, Ribbentrop. The subject matter was the Pearl Harbor\r\nattack. The top secret notes of this conference read in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * First the Fuehrer presents Ambassador Oshima with the\r\n    Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the German Eagle in gold.\r\n    With cordial words he acknowledges his services in the\r\n    achievement of German-Japanese cooperation, which has now\r\n    obtained its culmination in a close brotherhood of arms.\r\n\r\n    “General Oshima expresses his thanks for the great honor and\r\n    emphasizes how glad he is that this brotherhood of arms has now\r\n    come about between Germany and Japan.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer continues: “You gave the right declaration of war!”\r\n    This method is the only proper one. Japan pursued it formerly\r\n    and it corresponds with his own system, that is, to negotiate as\r\n    long as possible. But if one sees that the other is interested\r\n    only in putting one off, in shaming and humiliating one, and is\r\n    not willing to come to an agreement, then one should strike—as\r\n    hard as possible, indeed—and not waste time declaring war. It\r\n    was heartwarming to him to hear of the first operations of the\r\n    Japanese. He himself negotiated with infinite patience at times,\r\n    for example, with Poland and also with Russia. When he then\r\n    realized, that the other did not want to come to an agreement,\r\n    he struck suddenly and without formalities. He would continue to\r\n    go this way in the future.” (_2932-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO COLLABORATION WITH\r\n ITALY AND JAPAN AND AGGRESSIVE WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES: NOVEMBER\r\n                         1936 TO DECEMBER 1941\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (a).              │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (F)  │      │\r\n                │  7; V.                                 │  I   │  28, 29\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

It was a policy of\r\nunderfeeding and overworking foreign laborers, of subjecting them to\r\nevery form of degradation and brutality. It was a policy which compelled\r\nforeign workers and prisoners of war to manufacture armaments and to\r\nengage in other operations of war directed against their own countries.\r\nIt was, in short, a policy which constituted a flagrant violation of the\r\nlaws of war and the laws of humanity.\r\n\r\nFritz Sauckel and Albert Speer are principally responsible for the\r\nformulation of this policy and for its execution. Sauckel, the Nazi’s\r\nPlenipotentiary General for Manpower, directed the recruitment,\r\ndeportation, and allocation of foreign civilian labor. Sanctioning and\r\ndirecting the use of force as a means of recruitment, he was responsible\r\nfor the mistreatment of the enslaved millions. Speer—as Reichsminister\r\nfor Armaments and Munitions, Director of the Organization Todt, and\r\nmember of the Central Planning Board—bears responsibility for the\r\ndetermination of the numbers of foreign slaves required by the German\r\nwar machine, for the decision to recruit by force, and for the use and\r\nbrutal treatment of foreign civilians and prisoners of war in the\r\nmanufacture of armaments and munitions, in the construction of\r\nfortifications, and in active military operations.\r\n\r\nHermann Goering, as Plenipotentiary General for the Four Year Plan, is\r\nalso responsible for all the crimes involved in the Nazi slave labor\r\nprogram. In addition, Alfred Rosenberg as Reichsminister for the\r\nOccupied Eastern Territories, Hans Frank as Governor-General of the\r\nGovernment-General of Poland, Artur Seyss-Inquart as Reichskommissar for\r\nthe Occupied Netherlands, and Wilhelm Keitel as chief of the OKW share\r\nresponsibility for the recruitment by force and terror and for the\r\ndeportation to Germany of the citizens of the areas overrun or\r\nsubjugated by the _Wehrmacht_.\r\n\r\n                 1. PLANNING FOR THE USE OF SLAVE LABOR\r\n\r\nThe use of vast numbers of foreign workers was planned before Germany\r\nwent to war and was an integral part of the conspiracy for waging\r\naggressive war. On 23 May 1939 a meeting was held in Hitler’s study at\r\nthe Reichs Chancellery. Goering, Raeder, and Keitel were present.\r\nAccording to the minutes of this meeting, (_L-79_) Hitler stated that he\r\nintended to attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity. He further\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * If fate brings us into contact with the West, the\r\n    possession of extensive areas in the East will be advantageous.\r\n    We shall be able to rely upon record harvests, even less in time\r\n    of war than in peace.\r\n\r\n    “The population of non-German areas will perform no military\r\n    service, and will be available as a source of labor”. (_L-79_)\r\n\r\nThe slave labor program was designed to achieve two purposes. The\r\nprimary purpose was to satisfy the labor requirements of the Nazi war\r\nmachine by compelling foreign workers, in effect, to make war against\r\ntheir own countries and its allies. The secondary purpose was to destroy\r\nor weaken peoples deemed inferior by the Nazi racialists, or deemed\r\npotentially hostile by the Nazi planners of world supremacy. These\r\npurposes were expressed by the conspirators themselves. In Sauckel’s\r\nLabor Mobilization Program (_016-PS_) which he sent to Rosenberg on 20\r\nApril 1942, Sauckel declared:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The aim of this new, gigantic labor mobilization is to\r\n    use all the rich and tremendous sources, conquered and secured\r\n    for us by our fighting Armed Forces under the leadership of\r\n    Adolf Hitler, for the armament of the Armed Forces and also for\r\n    the nutrition of the Homeland. The raw materials as well as the\r\n    fertility of the conquered territories and their human labor\r\n    power are to be used completely and conscientiously to the\r\n    profit of Germany and their allies.” (_016-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe theory of the “master race,” which underlay the conspirators’ labor\r\npolicy in the East, was expressed in the following words by Erich Koch,\r\nReichskommissar for the Ukraine, at a meeting of the National Socialist\r\nParty on 5 March 1943 in Kiev:\r\n\r\n    “1. We are the master race and must govern hard but just * * *.\r\n\r\n    “2. I will draw the very last out of this country. I did not\r\n    come to spread bliss. I have come to help the Fuehrer. The\r\n    population must work, work, and work again * * * for some people\r\n    are getting excited, that the population may not get enough to\r\n    eat. The population cannot demand that, one has only to remember\r\n    what our heroes were deprived of in Stalingrad * * *. We\r\n    definitely did not come here to give out manna. We have come\r\n    here to create the basis for victory.\r\n\r\n    “3. We are a master race, which must remember that the lowliest\r\n    German worker is racially and biologically a thousand times more\r\n    valuable than the population here”. (_1130-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd in a speech delivered to a group of SS Generals on 4 October 1943 at\r\nPosen, Himmler stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest\r\n    me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in the way of\r\n    good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping\r\n    their children and raising them here with us. Whether nations\r\n    live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so\r\n    far as we need them as slaves for our _Kultur_: otherwise, it is\r\n    of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down\r\n    from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interests me\r\n    only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished *\r\n    * *.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nA Top Secret memorandum prepared for the Ministry of the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories on 12 June 1944, and approved by Rosenberg, contains\r\nthe following plans:\r\n\r\n    “The Army Group ‘Center’ has the intention to apprehend\r\n    40-50,000 youths at the ages of 10 to 14 who are in the Army\r\n    territory and to transport them to the Reich * * *.”\r\n\r\n    “It is intended to allot these juveniles primarily to the German\r\n    trades as apprentices to be used as skilled workers after 2\r\n    years’ training. This is to be arranged through the Organization\r\n    Todt which is especially equipped for such a task through its\r\n    technical and other set-ups. This action is being greatly\r\n    welcomed by the German trade since it represents a decisive\r\n    measure for the alleviation of the shortage of apprentices.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “1. This action is not only aimed at preventing a direct\r\n    reinforcement of the enemy’s military strength, but also at a\r\n    reduction of his biological potentialities as viewed from the\r\n    perspective of the future. These ideas have been voiced not only\r\n    by the Reichsfuehrer of the SS but also by the Fuehrer.\r\n    Corresponding orders were given during last year’s withdrawals\r\n    in the southern sector * * *.”(_031-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s approval is at the end of the document:\r\n\r\n    “regarding the above—Obergruppenfuehrer Berger received the\r\n    memorandum on June 14. Consequently the Reichsminister has\r\n    approved the Action.” (_031-PS_)\r\n\r\n                2. EXECUTION OF THE SLAVE LABOR PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe purposes of the slave labor program, namely, the strengthening of\r\nthe Nazi war machine and the destruction or weakening of peoples deemed\r\ninferior, were achieved by the impressment and deportation of millions\r\nof persons into Germany for forced labor, by the separation of husbands\r\nfrom their wives and children from their parents, and by the imposition\r\nof conditions so inhuman that countless numbers perished.\r\n\r\nA. _Poland._\r\n\r\nPoland was the first victim. Frank, as Governor of the\r\nGovernment-General of Poland, announced that under his program 1,000,000\r\nworkers were to be sent to Germany, and recommended that police surround\r\nPolish villages and seize the inhabitants for deportation. These\r\nintentions appear in the following letter from Frank to Goering, dated\r\n25 January 1940 (_1375-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “1. In view of the present requirements of the Reich for the\r\n    defense industry, it is at present fundamentally impossible to\r\n    carry on a long term economic policy in the\r\n    General-Gouvernement. Rather, it is necessary so to steer the\r\n    economy of the General Gouvernement that it will, in the\r\n    shortest possible time, accomplish results representing the\r\n    maximum that can be gotten out of the economic strength of the\r\n    General-Gouvernement for the immediate strengthening of our\r\n    capacity for defense.\r\n\r\n    “2. In particular the following performances are expected of the\r\n    total economy of the General-Gouvernement * * *.”\r\n\r\n    “(g) Supply and transportation of at least 1 million male and\r\n    female agricultural and industrial workers to the Reich—among\r\n    them at least 7,500,000 [sic] agricultural workers of which at\r\n    least 50% must be women—in order to guarantee agricultural\r\n    production in the Reich and as a replacement\r\n\r\nThe methods by which these workers were to be supplied were outlined by\r\nFrank in his diary entry for Friday, 10 May 1940 (_2233-A-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * Then the Governor-General deals with the problem of the\r\n    _Compulsory Labor Service_ of the Poles. Upon the demands from\r\n    the Reich it has now been decreed that compulsion may be\r\n    exercised in view of the fact that sufficient manpower was not\r\n    voluntarily available for service inside the German Reich. This\r\n    compulsion means the possibility of arrest of male and female\r\n    Poles. Because of these measures a certain disquietude had\r\n    developed which, according to individual reports, was spreading\r\n    very much, and which might produce difficulties everywhere.\r\n    General Fieldmarshal Goering some time ago pointed out in his\r\n    long speech the necessity to deport into the Reich a million\r\n    workers. The supply so far was 160,000. However, great\r\n    difficulties had to be overcome. Therefore it would be advisable\r\n    to consult the district and town chiefs in the execution of the\r\n    compulsion, so that one could be sure from the start that this\r\n    action would be reasonably successful. The arrest of young Poles\r\n    when leaving church service or the cinema would bring about an\r\n    increasing nervousness of the Poles. Generally speaking, he had\r\n    no objections at all if the rubbish, capable of work yet often\r\n    loitering about, would be snatched from the streets. The best\r\n    method for this, however, would be the organization of a raid,\r\n    and it would be absolutely justifiable to stop a Pole in the\r\n    street and to question him what he was doing, where he was\r\n    working etc.” (_2233-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother entry in the diary of Frank, for 16 March 1940, contains the\r\nfollowing discourse on methods:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Governor-General remarks that he had long\r\n    negotiations in Berlin with representatives of the Reich\r\n    Ministry for Finance and the Reich Ministry for Food. One has\r\n    made the urgent demand there that _Polish farm workers_ should\r\n    be sent to the Reich in greater numbers. He has made the\r\n    statement in Berlin that he, if it is demanded from him, can\r\n    naturally exercise force in such a manner that he has the police\r\n    surround a village and get the men and women, in question, out\r\n    by force, and then send them to Germany. But one can also work\r\n    differently, besides these police measures, by retaining the\r\n    unemployment compensation of those workers in question.”\r\n    (_2233-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe instruments of force and terror used to carry out this program\r\nreached into many phases of Polish life. German labor authorities raided\r\nchurches and theatres, seized those present, and shipped them to\r\nGermany. These facts appear in a memorandum to Himmler dated 17 April\r\n1943, written by Dr. Lammers, chief of the Reichs Chancellery, with\r\nregard to the situation in the Government General of Poland:\r\n\r\n    “* * * As things were, the utilization of manpower had to be\r\n    enforced by means of more or less forceful methods, such as the\r\n    instances when certain groups appointed by the Labor Offices,\r\n    caught Church and Movie-goers here and there and transported\r\n    them into the Reich. That such methods not only undermine the\r\n    people’s willingness to work and the people’s confidence to such\r\n    a degree that it cannot be checked even with terror, is just as\r\n    clear as the consequences brought about by a strengthening of\r\n    the political resistance movement”. (_2220-PS_)\r\n\r\nPolish farmland was confiscated with the aid of the SS, distributed to\r\nGerman inhabitants, or held in trust for the German community. The farm\r\nowners were thereupon employed as laborers or transported to Germany\r\nagainst their will. A report of the SS entitled “Achievement of\r\nConfiscations of Polish Agricultural Enterprises with the Purpose to\r\nTransfer the Poles to the old Reich and to Employ Them as Agricultural\r\nWorkers,” contains these disclosures:\r\n\r\n    “* * * It is possible without difficulty to accomplish the\r\n    confiscation of small agricultural enterprises in the villages\r\n    in which larger agricultural enterprises have been already\r\n    confiscated and are under the management of the East German\r\n    Corporation for agricultural development. * * * _The former\r\n    owners of Polish farms, together with their families will be\r\n    transferred to the old Reich by the employment agencies for\r\n    employment as farm workers._ In this way many hundreds of Polish\r\n    agricultural workers can be placed at the disposal of\r\n    agriculture in the old Reich in the shortest and simplest\r\n    manner. This way the most pressing shortage is removed that is\r\n    now in a very disagreeable manner felt especially in the\r\n    root-crop districts.” (_1352-PS_)\r\n\r\nPursuant to the directions of Sauckel, his agents and the SS deported\r\nPolish men to Germany without their families, thereby accomplishing the\r\nbasic purposes of the program: supplying labor for the German war effort\r\nand weakening the reproductive potential of the Polish people. Thus, in\r\na letter from Sauckel to the Presidents of the “Landes” Employment\r\nOffices, dated 26 November 1942, it is stated that:\r\n\r\n    “In agreement with the Chief of the Security Police and the SD,\r\n    Jews who are still in employment are, from now on, to be\r\n    evacuated from the territory of the Reich and are to be replaced\r\n    by Poles, who are being deported from the General-Gouvernement.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Poles who are to be evacuated as a result of this measure\r\n    will be put into concentration camps and put to work where they\r\n    are criminal or asocial elements. The remaining Poles where they\r\n    are suitable for labor, will be transported—without\r\n    family—into the Reich, particularly to Berlin; there they will\r\n    be put at the disposal of the labor allocation offices to work\r\n    in armament factories instead of the Jews who are to be\r\n    replaced.” (_L-61_)\r\n\r\nThe Nazi campaign of force, terror, and abduction was described in a\r\nletter to Frank written by the Chairman of the Ukrainian Main Committee,\r\nat Cracow, in February 1943. The letter states:\r\n\r\n    “The general nervousness is still more enhanced by the wrong\r\n    methods of finding labor which have been used more and more\r\n    frequently in recent months.\r\n\r\n    “The wild and ruthless man-hunt as exercised everywhere in towns\r\n    and country, in streets, squares, stations, even in churches, at\r\n    night in houses, has badly shaken the feeling of security of the\r\n    inhabitants. Everybody is exposed to the danger, to be seized\r\n    anywhere and at any time by members of the police, suddenly and\r\n    unexpectedly and to be brought into an assembly camp. None of\r\n    his relatives knows what has happened to him, only months later\r\n    one or the other gives news of his fate by a postcard.”\r\n    (_1526-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnd in enclosure 5 of the letter it is related that:\r\n\r\n    “In November of last year an inspection of all males of the age\r\n    groups 1910 to 1920 was ordered in the area of Zaleschozyki\r\n    (district of Czortkow). After the men had appeared for\r\n    inspection, all those who were chosen were arrested at once,\r\n    loaded into trains and sent to the Reich. Such recruiting of\r\n    laborers for the Reich also took place in other areas of this\r\n    district. Following some interventions the action was then\r\n    stopped”. (_1526-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the Polish people to this Nazi enslavement program and\r\nthe necessity for increased force were described by Sauckel’s deputy\r\nTimm at a meeting of the Central Planning Board, Hitler’s wartime\r\nplanning agency, which was composed of Speer, Field Marshal Milch, and\r\nState Secretary Koerner. The Central Planning Board was the highest\r\nlevel economic planning agency, and exercised production controls by\r\nallocating raw materials and labor to industrial users. Timm’s\r\nstatement, which was made at the 36th conference of the Board, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Especially in Poland the situation at the moment is\r\n    extraordinarily serious. It is well known that vehement battle\r\n    occurred just because of these actions. The resistance against\r\n    the administration established by us, is very strong. Quite a\r\n    number of our men have been exposed to increased dangers, and it\r\n    was just in the last two or three weeks that some of them were\r\n    shot dead, e.g. the Head of the Labor Office of Warsaw who was\r\n    shot in his office, and yesterday another man again. This is how\r\n    matters stand presently, and the recruiting itself even if done\r\n    with the best will remains extremely difficult unless police\r\n    reinforcements are at hand.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Occupied Eastern Territories._\r\n\r\nDeportation and enslavement of civilians reached unprecedented levels in\r\nthe Occupied Eastern Territories as a direct result of labor demands\r\nmade by Sauckel on Rosenberg, Reichsminister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories, on Rosenberg’s subordinates, and on the Armed Forces. On 5\r\nOctober 1942, for example, Sauckel wrote to Rosenberg stating that\r\n2,000,000 more foreign laborers were required, and that the majority of\r\nthese would have to be drafted from the recently occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories and especially from the Ukraine. The letter, (_017-PS_)\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has worked out new and most urgent plans for the\r\n    armament which require the quick mobilization of two more\r\n    million foreign labor forces. The Fuehrer therefore has granted\r\n    me, for the execution of my decree of 21 March 1942, new powers\r\n    for my new duties, and has especially authorized me to take\r\n    whatever measures I think are necessary in the Reich, the\r\n    Protectorate, the General-Gouvernement, as well as in the\r\n    occupied territories, in order to assure at all costs an orderly\r\n    mobilization of labor for the German armament industry. The\r\n    additional required labor forces will have to be drafted for the\r\n    majority from the recently occupied Eastern Territories,\r\n    especially from the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Therefore, the\r\n    Reichskommissariat Ukraine must furnish:\r\n\r\n    “225,000 labor forces by 31 December 1942 and 225,000 more by 1\r\n    May 1943.\r\n\r\n    “I ask you to inform Reichskommissar Gauleiter party fellow\r\n    member Koch about the new situation and requirements and\r\n    especially to see to it that he will support personally in any\r\n    possible way the execution of this new requirement.\r\n\r\n    “I have the intention to visit Party member Koch shortly and I\r\n    would be grateful to you if you could inform me as to where and\r\n    when I could meet him for a personal discussion.\r\n\r\n    “Right now though, I ask that the procurement be taken up at\r\n    once with every possible pressure and the commitment of all\r\n    powers especially also of the experts of the labor offices. All\r\n    the directives which had limited temporarily the procurement of\r\n    Eastern laborers are annulled. The Reichs procurement for the\r\n    next months must be given priority over all other measures.\r\n\r\n    “I do not ignore the difficulties which exist for the execution\r\n    of this new requirement, but I am convinced that with the\r\n    ruthless commitment of all resources, and with the full\r\n    cooperation of all those interested, the execution of the new\r\n    demands can be accomplished for the fixed date. I have already\r\n    communicated the new demands to the Reichskommissar Ukraine via\r\n    mail. In reference to our long distance phone call of today I\r\n    will send you the text of the Fuehrer’s decree at the beginning\r\n    of next week.” (_017-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain on 17 March 1943 Sauckel wrote Rosenberg, demanding the\r\nimportation of another 1,000,000 men and women from the Eastern\r\nterritories within the following four months (_019-PS_). Sauckel said:\r\n\r\n    “After a protracted illness my Deputy for Labor Supply in the\r\n    occupied Eastern Territories, State Councillor Peukert, is going\r\n    there to regulate the labor supply both for Germany and the\r\n    territories themselves.\r\n\r\n    “I ask you sincerely, dear party member Rosenberg, to assist him\r\n    to your utmost on account of the pressing urgency of Peukert’s\r\n    mission. Already now I may thank you for the hitherto good\r\n    reception accorded to Peukert. He himself has been charged by me\r\n    with the absolute and completely unreserved cooperation with all\r\n    bureaus of the Eastern Territories.\r\n\r\n    “Especially the labor supply for the German agriculture, and\r\n    likewise for the most urgent armament production programs\r\n    ordered by the Fuehrer make the fastest importation of\r\n    approximately 1 million women and men from the Eastern\r\n    Territories within the next four months a must. Starting 15\r\n    March the daily shipment must have reached 5,000 female and male\r\n    workers respectively, while beginning of April this number has\r\n    to be stepped up to 10,000. This is a requisite of the most\r\n    urgent programs, and the spring tillage, and other agricultural\r\n    tasks are not to suffer for the detriment of the nutrition and\r\n    of the armed forces.\r\n\r\n    “I have foreseen the allotment of the draft quotas for the\r\n    individual territories in agreement with your experts for the\r\n    labor supply as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Daily quota starting 15 March 1943:\r\n\r\n                                                                _People_\r\n “From General Commissariat White Ruthenia                           500\r\n “Economic Inspection Center                                         500\r\n “Reichs Commissariat Ukraine                                      3,000\r\n “Economic Inspection South                                        1,000\r\n                                                                     ———\r\n Total                                                             5,000\r\n\r\n    “Starting 1 April 1943 the daily quota is to be doubled\r\n    corresponding to the doubling of the entire quota.\r\n\r\n    “I hope to visit personally the Eastern Territories towards the\r\n    end of the month, and ask you once more for your kind support.”\r\n    (_019-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel travelled to Kauen in Lithuania to press his demands. A synopsis\r\nof a report of the City Commissioner of Kauen and minutes of a meeting\r\nin which Sauckel participated, reveal that:\r\n\r\n    “In a lecture which the Plenipotentiary for the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_, Gauleiter Sauckel made on 18 July 1943 in\r\n    Kauen and in an official conference following it, between\r\n    Gauleiter Sauckel and the General Commissar, the pool of labor\r\n    in the Reich was again brought up urgently: Gauleiter Sauckel\r\n    again demanded that Lithuanian labor be furnished in greater\r\n    volume for the purposes of the Reich.” (_204-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel also visited Riga, Latvia, to assert his demands. The purpose of\r\nthis visit is described in a letter from the Reich Commissar for the\r\nOstland to the Commissioner General in Riga, dated 3 May 1943. The\r\nletter states, in part:\r\n\r\n    “In reference to the basic statements of the Plenipotentiary\r\n    General for manpower, Gauleiter Sauckel on the occasion of his\r\n    visit to Riga on 21 April 1943, and in view of the critical\r\n    situation and in disregard of all contrary considerations, it\r\n    was decided that a total of 183,000 workers have to be supplied\r\n    from the Ostland for the Reich territory. This task must\r\n    absolutely be accomplished within the next four months and at\r\n    the latest must be completed by the end of August.” (_2280-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel asked the German Army for assistance in the recruitment and\r\ndeportation of civilian labor from the Eastern Territories. A secret\r\norganization order of the Army Group South, dated 17 August 1943, is to\r\nthe following effect:\r\n\r\n    “The Plenipotentiary General for Labor Employment ordered the\r\n    recruitment and employment of all born during two years for the\r\n    whole, newly occupied Eastern territory in Decree Az. VI A\r\n    5780.28 (Inclosure 1), copy of which is inclosed. The Reich\r\n    Minister for Armament and Munition approved this order.\r\n\r\n    “According to this order by the Plenipotentiary General for\r\n    Labor Employment (BGA) you have to recruit and to transport to\r\n    the Reich immediately all labor forces in your territory born\r\n    during 1926 and 1927. The decree relative labor duty and labor\r\n    employment in the theater of operations of the newly occupied\r\n    Eastern territory of the 6 February 1943 and the executive\r\n    orders therefore are the authority for the execution of this\r\n    measure. Enlistment must be completed by 30 Sept. 43 at the\r\n    latest.” (_3010-PS_)\r\n\r\nClearly, the demands made by Sauckel did result in the deportation of\r\ncivilians from the occupied Eastern territories. Speer has stated in a\r\nrecord of conferences with Hitler on 10, 11, and 12 August 1942 that:\r\n\r\n    “Gauleiter Sauckel promises to make Russian labor available for\r\n    the fulfillment of the iron and coal program and reports\r\n    that—if required—he can supply a further million Russian\r\n    laborers for the German armament industry up to and including\r\n    October 1942. So far, he has already supplied 1 million for\r\n    industry and 700,000 for agriculture. In this connection the\r\n    Fuehrer states that the problem of providing labor can be solved\r\n    in all cases and to any extent; he authorizes Gauleiter Sauckel\r\n    to take all measures required.\r\n\r\n    “He would agree to any necessary compulsion (_zwangsmassnahmen_)\r\n    in the East as well as in the West if this question could not be\r\n    solved on a voluntary basis.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\n           3. VIOLENT METHODS OF DEPORTATION FOR SLAVE LABOR\r\n\r\nIn order to meet these demands, the Nazi conspirators made terror,\r\nviolence, and arson the staple instruments of their policy of\r\nenslavement. Twenty days after Sauckel’s demands of 5 October 1942, a\r\nhigh official in Rosenberg’s Ministry by the name of Braeutigam, in a\r\nTop Secret memorandum dated 25 October 1942 described measures taken to\r\nmeet these demands:\r\n\r\n    “* * * We now experienced the grotesque picture of having to\r\n    recruit millions of laborers from the Occupied Eastern\r\n    Territories, after prisoners of war have died of hunger like\r\n    flies, in order to fill the gaps that have formed within\r\n    Germany. Now the food question no longer existed. In the\r\n    prevailing limitless abuse of the Slavic humanity ‘recruiting’\r\n    methods were used which probably have their origin in the\r\n    blackest periods of the slave trade. A regular manhunt was\r\n    inaugurated. Without consideration of health or age the people\r\n    were shipped to Germany where it turned out immediately that\r\n    more than 100,000 had to be sent back because of serious\r\n    illnesses and other incapabilities for work.” (_294-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg on 21 December 1942 wrote to Sauckel, the instigator of these\r\nbrutalities, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The reports I have received show, that the increase of the\r\n    guerilla bands in the occupied Eastern Regions is largely due to\r\n    the fact that the methods used for procuring laborers in these\r\n    regions are felt to be forced measures of mass deportations, so\r\n    that the endangered persons prefer to escape their fate by\r\n    withdrawing into the woods or going to the guerilla bands.”\r\n    (_018-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn attachment to Rosenberg’s letter, consisting of parts excerpted from\r\nletters of residents of the Occupied Eastern territories by Nazi\r\ncensors, relates that:\r\n\r\n    “At our place, new things have happened. People are being taken\r\n    to Germany. On Dec. 5, some people from the Kowkuski district\r\n    were scheduled to go, but they didn’t want to and the village\r\n    was set afire. They threatened to do the same thing in\r\n    Borowytschi, as not all who were scheduled to depart wanted to\r\n    go. Thereupon 3 truck loads of Germans arrived and set fire to\r\n    their houses. In Wrasnytschi 12 houses and in Borowytschi 3\r\n    houses were burned.\r\n\r\n    “On Oct. 1 a new conscription of labor forces took place. From\r\n    what has happened, I will describe the most important to you.\r\n    You can not imagine the bestiality. You probably remember what\r\n    we were told about the Soviets during the rule of the Poles. At\r\n    that time we did not believe it and now it seems just as\r\n    incredible. The order came to supply 25 workers, but no one\r\n    reported. All had fled. Then the German militia came and began\r\n    to ignite the houses of those who had fled. The fire became very\r\n    violent, since it had not rained for 2 months. In addition the\r\n    grain stacks were in the farm yards. You can imagine what took\r\n    place. The people who had hurried to the scene were forbidden to\r\n    extinguish the flames, beaten and arrested, so that 7 homesteads\r\n    burned down. The policemen meanwhile ignited other houses. The\r\n    people fell on their knees and kiss their hands, but the\r\n    policemen beat them with rubber truncheons and threaten to burn\r\n    down the whole village. I don’t know how this would have ended\r\n    if I Sapurkany had not intervened. He promised that there would\r\n    be laborers by morning. During the fire the militia went through\r\n    the adjoining villages, seized the laborers and brought them\r\n    under arrest. Wherever they did not find any laborers, they\r\n    detained the parents, until the children appeared. That is how\r\n    they raged throughout the night in Bielosirka. The workers which\r\n    had not yet appeared till then, were to be shot. All schools\r\n    were closed and the married teachers were sent to work here,\r\n    while the unmarried ones go to work in Germany. They are now\r\n    catching humans like the dog-catchers used to catch dogs. They\r\n    are already hunting for one week and have not yet enough. The\r\n    imprisoned workers are locked in at the schoolhouse. They cannot\r\n    even go out to perform their natural functions, but have to do\r\n    it like pigs in the same room. People from many villages went on\r\n    a certain day to a pilgrimage to the monastery Potschaew. They\r\n    were all arrested, locked in, and will be sent to work. Among\r\n    them there are lame, blind and aged people”. (_018-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg, nevertheless, countenanced the use of force in order to\r\nfurnish slave labor to Germany and admitted his responsibility for the\r\n“unusual and hard measures” that were employed. The transcript of an\r\ninterrogation of Rosenberg under oath on 6 October 1945, contains the\r\nfollowing admissions:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Q. You recognized, did you not, that the quotas set by\r\n    Sauckel could not be filled by voluntary labor, and you didn’t\r\n    disapprove of the impressment of forced labor; isn’t that right?\r\n\r\n    “A. I regretted that the demands of Sauckel were so urgent that\r\n    they could not be met by a continuation of voluntary recruitment\r\n    and thus I submitted to the necessity of forced impressment.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Q. The letters that we have already seen between you and\r\n    Sauckel, do not indicate, do they, any disagreement on your part\r\n    with the principle of recruiting labor against their will; they\r\n    indicate, as I remember, that you were opposed to the treatment\r\n    that was later accorded these workers; that you did not oppose\r\n    their initial impressment.\r\n\r\n    “A. That is right. In those letters I mostly discussed the\r\n    possibility of finding the least harsh methods of handling the\r\n    matter; whereas, in no way, I placed myself in opposition to the\r\n    orders that he was carrying out for the Fuehrer.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, in a letter dated 21 December 1942 Rosenberg stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Even if I do not close my eyes to the necessity that the\r\n    numbers demanded by the Reichs Minister for weapons and\r\n    ammunition as well as by the agricultural economy justify\r\n    unusual and hard measures, I have to ask, due to the\r\n    responsibility for the occupied Eastern Territories which lies\r\n    upon me, that in the accomplishment of the ordered tasks such\r\n    measures be excluded, the toleration and prosecution of which\r\n    will some day be held against me, and my collaborators.”\r\n    (_018-PS_)\r\n\r\nArson was used as a terror device in the Ukraine to enforce conscription\r\nmeasures. One instance is reported in a document from an official of the\r\nRosenberg Ministry dated 29 June 1944, enclosing a copy of a letter from\r\nPaul Raab, a district commissioner in the territory of Wassilkow, to\r\nRosenberg. Raab’s letter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “According to a charge by the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\n    Forces I burned down a few houses in the territory of\r\n    Wassilkow/Ukr. belonging to insubordinate people ordered for\r\n    work-duty (_Arbeitseinsatzpflichtigen_). This accusation is\r\n    true.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “During the year 1942, the conscription of workers was\r\n    accomplished by way of propaganda. Only very rarely was force\r\n    necessary. Only in August 1942, measures had to be taken against\r\n    2 families in the villages Glewenka and Salisny-Chutter, each of\r\n    which were to supply one person for labor. Both were requested\r\n    in June for the first time, but didn’t obey although requested\r\n    repeatedly. They had to be brought up by force, but succeeded\r\n    twice to escape from the collecting camp, or when being on\r\n    transport. Before the second arrest, the fathers of both of the\r\n    men were taken into custody, to be kept as hostages and to be\r\n    released only when their sons would show up. When, after the\r\n    second escape, rearrest of both the fathers and boys was\r\n    ordered, the police patrols ordered to do so, found the houses\r\n    to be empty.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “That time I decided to take measures to show the increasingly\r\n    rebellious Ukrainian youth that our orders have to be followed.\r\n    I ordered the burning down of the houses of the fugitives.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “After the initial successes, a passive resistance of the\r\n    population started, which finally forced me to start again on\r\n    making arrests, confiscations, and transfers to labor camps.\r\n    After a while a transport of people, obliged to work, overran\r\n    the police in the railroad station in Wassilkow and escaped. I\r\n    saw again the necessity for strict measures. A few ring leaders,\r\n    which of course escaped before they were found in Plissezkoje\r\n    and in Mitnitza. After repeated attempts to get hold of them,\r\n    their houses were burned down.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “My actions against fugitive people obliged to work\r\n    (_Arbeitseinsatzpflichtige_), were always reported to district\r\n    commissioner Doehrer, in office in Wassilkow, and to the\r\n    general-commissioner (_Generalkommissar_) in Kiev. Both of them\r\n    know the circumstances and agreed with my measures, because of\r\n    their success.” (_254-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe village of Biloserka in the Ukraine was also the victim of arson as\r\nhas already been related in the quotation from the enclosure to\r\nRosenberg’s letter of 21 December 1942 to Sauckel (_018-PS_). Additional\r\nproof of resort to arson in this village is furnished by other\r\ncorrespondence originating within the Rosenberg Ministry and dated 12\r\nNovember 1943:\r\n\r\n    “But even if Mueller had been present at the burning of houses\r\n    in connection with the national conscription in Biloserka, this\r\n    should by no means lead to the relief of Mueller from office. It\r\n    is mentioned specifically in a directive of the Commissioner\r\n    General in Lusk of 21 Sept 1942, referring to the extreme\r\n    urgency of the national conscription.\r\n\r\n    ‘Estates of those who refuse to work are to be burned, their\r\n    relatives are to be arrested as hostages and to be brought to\r\n    forced labor camps.’” (_290-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe SS was directed to participate in the abduction of slave laborers,\r\nand in the case of raids on villages or burning of villages, to turn the\r\nentire population over for slave labor in Germany. A secret SS order\r\ndated 19 March 1943 (_3012-PS_) states:\r\n\r\n    “The activity of the labor offices, resp. of recruiting\r\n    commissions, is to be supported to the greatest extent possible.\r\n    It will not be possible always to refrain from using force.\r\n    During a conference with the Chief of the Labor Commitment\r\n    Staffs, an agreement was reached stating that whatever prisoners\r\n    can be released, they should be put at the disposal of the\r\n    Commissioner of the Labor Office. When searching (_Uberholung_)\r\n    villages, resp., when it has become necessary to burn down\r\n    villages, the whole population will be put at the disposal of\r\n    the Commissioner by force.” (_3012-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrom Shitomir, where Sauckel appealed for more workers for the Reich,\r\nthe Commissioner General reported on the brutality of the conspirators’\r\nprogram, which he described as a program of coercion and slavery. This\r\nis revealed in a secret report of a conference between the Commissioner\r\nGeneral of Shitomir and Rosenberg in Winniza on 17 June 1943 (_265-PS_).\r\nThe report is dated 30 June 1943 and is signed by Leyser. It reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “The symptoms created by the recruiting of workers are, no\r\n    doubt, well known to the Reichs Minister through reports and his\r\n    own observations. Therefore, I shall not report them. It is\r\n    certain that a recruitment of labor, in this sense of the word,\r\n    can hardly be spoken of. In most cases, it is nowadays a matter\r\n    of actual conscription by force.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “But as the Chief Plenipotentiary for the mobilization of labor\r\n    explained to us the gravity of the situation, we had no other\r\n    device. I consequently have authorized the commissioners of the\r\n    areas to apply the severest measures in order to achieve the\r\n    imposed quota. The deterioration of morale in conjunction with\r\n    this does not necessitate any further proof. It is nevertheless\r\n    essential to win the war on this front too. The problem of labor\r\n    mobilization cannot be handled with gloves.” (_265-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese recruitment measures enslaved so many citizens of occupied\r\ncountries that entire areas were depopulated. Thus, a report from the\r\nChief of Main Office III with the High Command in Minsk, dated 28 June\r\n1943, to Ministerialdirektor Riecke, a top official in the Rosenberg\r\nMinistry states:\r\n\r\n    “The recruitment of labor for the Reich, however necessary, had\r\n    disastrous effects. The recruitment measures in the last months\r\n    and weeks were absolute manhunts, which have an irreparable\r\n    political and economic effect. From White Ruthenia, approx.\r\n    50,000 people have been obtained for the Reich so far. Another\r\n    130,000 are to be obtained. Considering the 2.4 million total\r\n    population these figures are impossible. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Due to the sweeping drives (_Grossaktionen_) of the SS and\r\n    police in November 1942, about 115,000 hectar farmland is not\r\n    used, as the population is not there and the villages have been\r\n    razed. * * *” (_3000-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe conspirators’ policy, of permanently weakening the enemy through the\r\nenslavement of labor and breaking up of families, was applied in the\r\nOccupied Eastern Territories after Rosenberg’s approval of a plan for\r\nthe apprehension and deportation of 40,000 to 50,000 youths of the ages\r\nfrom 10 to 14. The stated purpose of this plan, approved by Rosenberg,\r\nwas to prevent a reinforcement of the enemy’s military strength and to\r\nreduce the enemy’s biological potentialities. (_031-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of the Nazi conspirators’ plan to weaken their enemies\r\nin utter disregard of the rules of International Law is contained in a\r\nsecret order issued by a rear-area Military Commandant, to the District\r\nCommissar at Kasatin on 25 December 1943. The order provided in part\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n    “1. The able-bodied male population between 15 and 65 years of\r\n    age and the cattle are to be shipped back from the district East\r\n    of the line Belilowka-Berditschen-Shitomir (places excluded).”\r\n    (_1702-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe program of enslavement and its accompanying measures of brutality\r\nwere not limited to Poland and the Eastern Occupied Territories, but\r\nextended to Western Europe as well. Frenchmen, Dutchmen, Belgians, and\r\nItalians all came to know the Nazi slavemasters. In France these\r\nslavemasters intensified their program in the early part of 1943\r\npursuant to instructions which Speer telephoned to Sauckel from Hitler’s\r\nheadquarters at eight in the evening of 4 January 1943. These\r\ninstructions are found in a note for the files signed by Sauckel, dated\r\n5 January 1943, which states:\r\n\r\n    “1. On 4 January 1943 at 8 p. m. Minister Speer telephones from\r\n    the Fuehrer’s headquarters and communicates that on the basis of\r\n    the Fuehrer’s decision, it is no longer necessary to give\r\n    special consideration to Frenchmen in the further recruiting of\r\n    specialists and helpers in France. The recruiting can proceed\r\n    with emphasis and sharpened measures.” (_556-13-PS_)\r\n\r\nTo overcome the resistance to his enslavement program, Sauckel\r\nimprovised new impressment measures which were applied in both France\r\nand Italy by his own agents and which he himself labelled as grotesque.\r\nAt a meeting of the Central Planning Board on 1 March 1944 Sauckel\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “The most abominable point made by my adversaries is their claim\r\n    that no executive had been provided within these areas in order\r\n    to recruit in a sensible manner the Frenchmen, Belgians and\r\n    Italians and to dispatch them to work. Thereupon I even\r\n    proceeded to employ and train a whole batch of French male and\r\n    female agents who for good pay just as was done in olden times\r\n    for “shanghaiing” went hunting for men and made them drunk by\r\n    using liquor as well as words, in order to dispatch them to\r\n    Germany.\r\n\r\n    “Moreover, I charged some able men with founding a special labor\r\n    supply executive of our own, and this they did by training and\r\n    arming with the help of the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer, a\r\n    number of natives, but I still have to ask the Munitions\r\n    Ministry for arms for the use of these men. For during the last\r\n    year alone several dozens of very able labor executive officers\r\n    have been shot dead. All these means I have to apply, grotesque\r\n    as it sounds, to refute the allegation there was no executive to\r\n    bring labor to Germany from these countries.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nAs in France, the slave hunt in Holland was accompanied by terror and\r\nabduction. The “Statement of the Netherlands Government in view of the\r\nProsecution and Punishment of the German Major War Criminals”,\r\n(_1726-PS_) contains the following account of the deportation of\r\nNetherlands workmen to Germany:\r\n\r\n    “Many big and reasonably large business concerns, especially in\r\n    the metal industry, were visited by German commissions who\r\n    appointed workmen for deportation. This combing out of the\r\n    concerns was called the “Sauckel-action”, so named after its\r\n    leader, who was charged with the appointment of foreign workmen\r\n    in Germany.\r\n\r\n    “The employers had to cancel the contracts with the appointed\r\n    workmen temporarily, and the latter were forced to register at\r\n    the labour offices, which then took care of the deportation\r\n    under supervision of German ‘_Fachberater_.’\r\n\r\n    “Workmen who refused (relatively few) were prosecuted by the\r\n    _Sicherheitsdeinst_ (SD). If captured by this service, they were\r\n    mostly lodged for some time in one of the infamous prisoners\r\n    camps in the Netherlands and eventually put to work in Germany.\r\n\r\n    “In this prosecution the _Sicherheitsdienst_ was supported by\r\n    the German Police Service, which was connected with the labour\r\n    offices, and was composed of members of the N.S.B. and the like.\r\n\r\n    “At the end of April 1942 the deportation of working labourers\r\n    started on a grand scale. Consequently in the months of May and\r\n    June the number of deportees amounted to not less than 22,000,\r\n    resp. 24,000 of which many were metal workers.\r\n\r\n    “After that the action slackened somewhat, but in October 1942\r\n    another top was reached (2,600). After the big concerns, the\r\n    smaller ones had, in their turn, to give up their personnel.\r\n\r\n    “This changed in November 1944. The Germans then started a\r\n    ruthless campaign for manpower, passing by the labour offices.\r\n    Without warning, they lined off whole quarters of the towns,\r\n    seized people in the streets or in the houses and deported them.\r\n\r\n    “In Rotterdam and Schiedam where these raids (razzia’s) took\r\n    place on 10 and 11 November, the amount of people thus deported\r\n    was estimated at 50,000 and 5,000 respectively.\r\n\r\n    “In other places where the raids were held later, the numbers\r\n    were much lower, because one was forewarned by the events. The\r\n    exact figures are not known as they have never been published by\r\n    the occupants.\r\n\r\n    “The people thus seized were put to work partly in the\r\n    Netherlands, partly in Germany * * *.” (_1726-PS_)\r\n\r\nA document found in the OKH files furnishes further evidence of the\r\nseizure of workers in Holland. This document contains the partial text\r\nof a lecture delivered by a Lieutenant Haupt of the German _Wehrmacht_\r\nconcerning the situation of the war economy in the Netherlands:\r\n\r\n    “There had been some difficulties with the _Arbeitseinsatz_,\r\n    i.e., during the man-catching action (_Menchenfang Aktion_)\r\n    which became very noticeable because it was unorganized and\r\n    unprepared. People were arrested in the streets and taken out of\r\n    their homes. It has been impossible to carry out a unified\r\n    release procedure in advance, because for security reasons, the\r\n    time for the action had not been previously announced.\r\n    Certificates of release, furthermore, were to some extent not\r\n    recognized by the officials who carried out the action. Not only\r\n    workers who had become available through the stoppage of\r\n    industry but also those who were employed in our installations\r\n    producing things for our immediate need. They were apprehended\r\n    or did not dare to go into the streets. In any case it proved to\r\n    be a great loss to us. * * *” (_3003-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 4. RESULTS OF THE SLAVE LABOR PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe hordes of displaced persons in Germany today reflect the extent to\r\nwhich the Nazi conspirators’ labor program succeeded. The best available\r\nAllied and German data reveal that as of January 1945 approximately\r\n4,795,000 foreign civilian workers had been put to work for the German\r\nwar effort in the old Reich, among them slave laborers of more than 14\r\ndifferent nationalities.

The highest number of prisoners of\r\n    war so employed was 400,000 in June 1944, the decrease to\r\n    December 1944 being accounted for in part by a change in status\r\n    from prisoners to civilian workers. A figure of 2,070,000\r\n    Russians uncovered in the American, British and French zones,\r\n    given in ‘Displaced Persons Report No. 43,’ of the Combined\r\n    Displaced Persons’ Executive, c/o G-5 Division, USFET, 30\r\n    September 1945, was increased by 430,000 to allow for Russians\r\n    estimated to have been found on German territory conquered by\r\n    the Red Army.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The designation ‘Politicals’ at the head of the third column in\r\n    the table should be taken to mean persons who upon being\r\n    uncovered in Germany by the Allied forces asserted that they\r\n    were arrested in their native countries for subversive\r\n    activities against the Nazis, and were transported to Germany\r\n    for incarceration. The figures do not include racial or\r\n    religious deportees, nor persons imprisoned for crimes allegedly\r\n    committed in Germany * * *.” (_2520-PS_)\r\n\r\nOnly a small proportion of the foreign workers brought to Germany were\r\nvolunteers. At the 1 March 1944 meeting of the Central Planning Board,\r\nSauckel made clear the vast scale of slavery. He stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Out of five million foreign workers who arrived in\r\n    Germany, not even 200,000 came voluntarily.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\n              5. CONDITIONS OF DEPORTATION AND SLAVE LABOR\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators were not satisfied to tear 5,000,000 persons from\r\ntheir families, their homes, and their country. They insisted that these\r\n5,000,000 wretches, while being deported to Germany or after their\r\narrival, be degraded, beaten, and permitted to die for want of food,\r\nclothing, and adequate shelter. Conditions of deportation are vividly\r\ndescribed in a report to Rosenberg concerning treatment of Ukrainian\r\nlabor (_054-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The starosts esp. village elders are frequently corruptible,\r\n    they continue to have the skilled workers, whom they drafted,\r\n    dragged from their beds at night to be locked up in cellars\r\n    until they are shipped. Since the male and female workers often\r\n    are not given any time to pack their luggage, etc., many skilled\r\n    workers arrive at the Collecting Center for Skilled Workers with\r\n    equipment entirely insufficient (without shoes, only two\r\n    dresses, no eating and drinking utensils, no blankets, etc.). In\r\n    particularly extreme cases new arrivals therefore have to be\r\n    sent back again immediately to get the things most necessary for\r\n    them. If people do not come along at once, threatening and\r\n    beating of skilled workers by the above-mentioned militia is a\r\n    daily occurrence and is reported from most of the communities.\r\n    In some cases women were beaten until they could no longer\r\n    march. One bad case in particular was reported by me to the\r\n    commander of the civil police here (Colonel Samek) for severe\r\n    punishment (place Sozolinkow, district Dergatschi). The\r\n    encroachments of the starosts and the militia are of a\r\n    particularly grave nature because they usually justify\r\n    themselves by claiming that all that is done in the name of the\r\n    German Armed Forces. In reality the latter have conducted\r\n    themselves throughout in a highly understanding manner toward\r\n    the skilled workers and the Ukrainian population. The same,\r\n    however, can not be said of some of the administrative agencies.\r\n    To illustrate this be it mentioned, that a woman once arrived\r\n    being dressed with barely more than a shirt.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * On the basis of reported incidents, attention must be\r\n    called to the fact that it is irresponsible to keep workers\r\n    locked in the cars for many hours so that they cannot even take\r\n    care of the calls of nature. It is evident that the people of a\r\n    transport must be given an opportunity from time to time in\r\n    order to get drinking water, to wash, and in order to relieve\r\n    themselves. Cars have been showed in which people had made holes\r\n    so that they could take care of the calls of nature. When\r\n    nearing bigger stations persons should, if possible, relieve\r\n    themselves far from these stations.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The following abuses were reported from the delousing stations:\r\n\r\n    “In the women’s and girls’ shower rooms, services were partly\r\n    performed by men or men would mingle around or even helped with\r\n    the soaping; and vice versa, there were female personnel in the\r\n    men’s shower rooms; men also for some time were taking\r\n    photographs in the women’s shower rooms. Since mainly Ukrainian\r\n    peasants were transported in the last months, as far as the\r\n    female portion of these are concerned, they were mostly of a\r\n    high moral standard and used to strict decency, they must have\r\n    considered such a treatment as a national degradation. The\r\n    above-mentioned abuses have been, according to our knowledge,\r\n    settled by the intervention of the transport commanders. The\r\n    reports of the photographing were made from Halle; the reports\r\n    about the former were made from Kiewerce. Such incidents in\r\n    complete disregard of the honor and respect of the Greater\r\n    German Reich may still occur again here or there.” (_054-PS_)\r\n\r\nSick and infirm citizens of the occupied countries were taken\r\nindiscriminately with the rest. Those who managed to survive the trip\r\ninto Germany, but who arrived too sick to work, were returned like\r\ncattle, together with those who fell ill at work, because they were of\r\nno further use to the Germans. The return trip took place under the same\r\nconditions as the initial journey, and without any kind of medical\r\nsupervision. Death came to many, and their corpses were unceremoniously\r\ndumped out of the cars with no provision for burial. Thus, the report\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Very depressing for the morale of the skilled workers and\r\n    the population is the effect of those persons shipped back from\r\n    Germany for having become disabled or not having been fit for\r\n    labor commitment from the very beginning. Several times already\r\n    transports of skilled workers on their way to Germany have\r\n    crossed returning transports of such disabled persons and have\r\n    stood on the tracks alongside of each other for a longer period\r\n    of time. Those returning transports are insufficiently cared\r\n    for. Nothing but sick, injured of weak people, mostly 50-60 to a\r\n    car, are usually escorted by 3-4 men. There is neither\r\n    sufficient care or food. The returnees made frequently\r\n    unfavourable—but surely exaggerated—statements relative to\r\n    their treatment in Germany and on the way. As a result of all\r\n    this and of what the people could see with their own eyes, a\r\n    psychosis of fear was evoked among the specialist workers resp.\r\n    the whole transport to Germany. Several transport leaders of the\r\n    62d and the 63d in particular reported thereto in detail. In one\r\n    case the leader of the transport of skilled workers observed\r\n    with own eyes how a person who died of hunger was unloaded from\r\n    a returning transport on the side track. (1st Lt. Hofman of the\r\n    63rd transport Station Darniza). Another time it was reported\r\n    that 3 dead had to be deposited by the side of the tracks on the\r\n    way and had to be left behind unburied by the escort. It is also\r\n    regrettable that these disabled persons arrive here without any\r\n    identification. According to the reports of the transport\r\n    commanders one gets the impression that these persons unable to\r\n    work are assembled, penned into the wagons and are sent off\r\n    provided only by a few men escort, and without special care for\r\n    food and medical or other attendance. The Labor Office at the\r\n    place of arrival as well as the transport commanders confirm\r\n    this impression.” (_054-PS_)\r\n\r\nMothers in childbirth shared cars with those infected with tuberculosis\r\nor venereal diseases. Babies when born were hurled out of windows. Dying\r\npersons lay on the bare floors of freight cars without even the small\r\ncomfort of straw. These conditions are revealed in an interdepartmental\r\nreport prepared by Dr. Gutkelch in Rosenberg’s Ministry, dated 30\r\nSeptember 1942, from which the following quotation is taken:\r\n\r\n    “How necessary this interference was is shown by the fact that\r\n    this train with returning laborers had stopped at the same place\r\n    where a train with newly recruited Eastern laborers had stopped.\r\n    Because of the corpses in the train-load of returning laborers,\r\n    a catastrophe might have been precipitated had it not been for\r\n    the mediation of Mrs. Miller. In this train women gave birth to\r\n    babies who were thrown out of the windows during the journey,\r\n    people having tuberculosis and venereal diseases rode in the\r\n    same car, dying people lay in freight cars without straw, and\r\n    one of the dead was thrown on the railway embankment. The same\r\n    must have occurred in other returning transports.” (_084-PS_)\r\n\r\nSome aspects of Nazi transport were described by Sauckel himself in a\r\ndecree which he issued on 20 July 1942, (_2241-PS_). The original decree\r\nis published in section B1a, page 48e of a book entitled “_Die\r\nBeschaeftigung von auslaendischen Arbeitskraeften in Deutschland_.” The\r\ndecree reads, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “According to reports of transportation commanders\r\n    (_Transportleiters_) presented to me, the special trains\r\n    provided by the German railway have frequently been in a really\r\n    deficient condition. Numerous windowpanes have been missing in\r\n    the coaches. Old French coaches without lavatories have been\r\n    partly employed so that the workers had to fit up an emptied\r\n    compartment as a lavatory. In other cases, the coaches were not\r\n    heated in winter so that the lavatories quickly became unusable\r\n    because the water system was frozen and the flushing apparatus\r\n    was therefore without water.” (_2241-PS_)\r\n\r\nMany of the foregoing documents, it will be noted, consist of complaints\r\nby functionaries of the Rosenberg ministry or by others concerning the\r\nconditions under which foreign workers were recruited and compelled to\r\nlive. These documents establish not only the facts therein recited, but\r\nalso show that the Nazi conspirators had knowledge of such conditions.\r\nNotwithstanding their knowledge of these conditions, however, the Nazi\r\nconspirators continued to countenance and assist in the enslavement of a\r\nvast number of citizens of occupied countries.\r\n\r\nOnce within Germany, slave laborers were subjected to treatment of an\r\nunusually brutal and degrading nature. The character of Nazi treatment\r\nwas in part made plain by the conspirator’s own statements. Sauckel\r\ndeclared on one occasion:\r\n\r\n    “All the men must be fed, sheltered and treated in such a way as\r\n    to exploit them to the highest possible extent at the lowest\r\n    conceivable degree of expenditure.” (_016-PS_)\r\n\r\nForce and brutality as instruments of production found a ready adherent\r\nin Speer who, in the presence of Sauckel, said at a meeting of the\r\nCentral Planning Board:\r\n\r\n    “We must also discuss the slackers. Ley has ascertained that the\r\n    sick-list decreased to one-fourth or one-fifth in factories\r\n    where doctors are on the staff who are examining the sick men.\r\n    There is nothing to be said against SS and police taking drastic\r\n    steps and putting those known as slackers into concentration\r\n    camps. There is no alternative. Let it happen several times and\r\n    the news will soon go round.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nAt a later meeting of the Central Planning Board, Field Marshall Milch\r\nagreed that so far as workers were concerned,\r\n\r\n    “The list of the shirkers should be entrusted to Himmler’s\r\n    trustworthy hands.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nMilch made particular reference to foreign workers by stating:\r\n\r\n    “It is therefore not possible to exploit fully all the\r\n    foreigners unless we compel them by piece-work or we have the\r\n    possibility of taking measures against foreigners who are not\r\n    doing their bit.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nThe policy as actually executed was even more Draconian than the policy\r\nas planned by the conspirators. Impressed workers were underfed and\r\noverworked. They were forced to live in grossly overcrowded camps where\r\nthey were held as virtual prisoners and were otherwise denied adequate\r\nshelter. They were denied adequate clothing, adequate medical care and\r\ntreatment and, as a result, suffered from many diseases and ailments.\r\nThey were generally forced to work long hours up to and beyond the point\r\nof exhaustion. They were beaten and subjected to inhuman indignities.\r\n\r\nAn example of this mistreatment is found in the conditions which\r\nprevailed in the Krupp factories. Foreign laborers at the Krupp Works\r\nwere given insufficient food to enable them to perform the work required\r\nof them. A memorandum upon Krupp stationery to Mr. Hupe, director of the\r\nKrupp Locomotive Factory in Essen, dated 14 March 1942, states:\r\n\r\n    “During the last few days we established that the food for the\r\n    Russians employed here is so miserable, that the people are\r\n    getting weaker from day to day.\r\n\r\n    “Investigations showed that single Russians are not able to\r\n    place a piece of metal for turning into position for instance,\r\n    because of lack of physical strength. The same conditions exist\r\n    at all places of work where Russians are employed.” (_D-316_)\r\n\r\nThe condition of foreign workers in Krupp workers camps is described in\r\ndetail in an affidavit executed in Essen, Germany, on 15 October 1945 by\r\nDr. Wilhelm Jager, who was the senior camp doctor. Dr. Jager makes the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Conditions in all these camps were extremely bad. The\r\n    camps were greatly overcrowded. In some camps there were twice\r\n    as many people in a barrack as health conditions permitted. At\r\n    Kramerplatz, the inhabitants slept in treble-tiered bunks, and\r\n    in the other camps they slept in double-tiered bunks. The health\r\n    authorities prescribed a _minimum_ space between beds of 50 cm.\r\n    but the bunks in these camps were separated by a _maximum_ of\r\n    20-30 cm.\r\n\r\n    “The diet prescribed for the eastern workers was altogether\r\n    insufficient. They were given 1,000 calories a day less than the\r\n    minimum prescribed for any German. Moreover, while German\r\n    workers engaged in the heaviest work received 5,000 calories a\r\n    day, the eastern workers in comparable jobs received only 2,000\r\n    calories. The eastern workers were given only 2 meals a day and\r\n    their bread ration. One of these two meals consisted of a thin,\r\n    watery soup. I had no assurance that the eastern workers, in\r\n    fact, received the minimum which was prescribed. Subsequently,\r\n    in 1943, when I undertook to inspect the food prepared by the\r\n    cooks, I discovered a number of instances in which food was\r\n    withheld from the workers.\r\n\r\n    “The plan for food distribution called for a small quantity of\r\n    meat per week. Only inferior meats, rejected by the veterinary\r\n    such as horse meat or tuberculin infested was permitted for this\r\n    purpose. This meat was usually cooked into a soup.\r\n\r\n    “The clothing of the eastern workers was likewise completely\r\n    inadequate. They worked and slept in the same clothing in which\r\n    they had arrived from the east. Virtually all of them had no\r\n    overcoats and were compelled, therefore, to use their blankets\r\n    as coats in cold and rainy weather. In view of the shortage of\r\n    shoes many workers were forced to go to work in their bare feet,\r\n    even in the winter. Wooden shoes were given to some of the\r\n    workers, but their quality was such as to give the workers sore\r\n    feet. Many workers preferred to go to work in their bare feet\r\n    rather than endure the suffering caused by the wooden shoes.\r\n    Apart from the wooden shoes, no clothing of any kind was issued\r\n    to the workers until the latter part of 1943, when a single blue\r\n    suit was issued to some of them. To my knowledge, this\r\n    represented the sole issue of clothing to the workers from the\r\n    time of their arrival until the American forces entered Essen.\r\n\r\n    “Sanitary conditions were exceedingly bad. At Kramerplatz, where\r\n    approximately 1,200 eastern workers were crowded into the rooms\r\n    of an old school, the sanitary conditions were atrocious in the\r\n    extreme. Only 10 children’s toilets were available for the 1,200\r\n    inhabitants. At Dechenschule, 15 children’s toilets were\r\n    available for the 400-500 eastern workers. Excretion\r\n    contaminated the entire floors of these lavatories. There were\r\n    also few facilities for washing. The supply of bandages,\r\n    medicine, surgical instruments, and other medical supplies at\r\n    these camps was likewise altogether insufficient. As a\r\n    consequence, only the very worst cases were treated.\r\n\r\n    “The percentage of eastern workers who were ill was twice as\r\n    great as among the Germans. Tuberculosis was particularly\r\n    widespread among the eastern workers. The T. B. rate among them\r\n    was 4 times the normal rate of (2 percent eastern workers,\r\n    German .5 percent). At Dechenschule approximately 2½ percent of\r\n    the workers suffered from open T. B. These were all active T. B.\r\n    cases. The Tartars and Kirghis suffered most; as soon as they\r\n    were overcome by this disease they collapsed like flies. The\r\n    cause was bad housing, the poor quality and insufficient\r\n    quantity of food, overwork, and insufficient rest.\r\n\r\n    “These workers were likewise afflicted with spotted fever. Lice\r\n    the carrier of this disease, together with countless fleas, bugs\r\n    and other vermin tortured the inhabitants of these camps. As a\r\n    result of the filthy conditions of the camps nearly all eastern\r\n    workers were afflicted with skin disease. The shortage of food\r\n    also caused many cases of Hunher-Oedem, Nephritis, and\r\n    Shighakruse.\r\n\r\n    “It was the general rule that workers were compelled to go to\r\n    work unless a camp doctor had prescribed that they were unfit\r\n    for work. At Seumannstrasse, Grieperstrasse, Germanistrasse,\r\n    Kapitanlehmannstrasse, and Dechenschule, there was no daily sick\r\n    call. At these camps, the doctors did not appear for two or\r\n    three days. As a consequence, workers were forced to go to work\r\n    despite illnesses.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Camp Humboldstrasse has been inhabitated by Italian prisoners\r\n    of war. After it had been destroyed by an air raid, the Italians\r\n    were removed and 600 Jewish females from Buchenwald\r\n    Concentration Camp were brought in to work at the Krupp\r\n    factories. Upon my first visit at Camp Humboldstrasse, I found\r\n    these females suffering from open festering wounds and other\r\n    diseases.\r\n\r\n    “I was the first doctor they had seen for at least a fortnight.\r\n    There was no doctor in attendance at the camp. There was no\r\n    medical supplies in the camp. They had no shoes and went about\r\n    in their bare feet. The sole clothing of each consisted of a\r\n    sack with holes for their arms and head. Their hair was shorn.\r\n    The camp was surrounded by barbed wire and closely guarded by SS\r\n    guards.\r\n\r\n    “The amount of food in the camp was extremely meagre and of very\r\n    poor quality. The houses in which they lived consisted of the\r\n    ruins of former barracks and they afforded no shelter against\r\n    rain and other weather conditions. I reported to my superiors\r\n    that the guards lived and slept outside their barracks as one\r\n    could not enter them without being attacked by 10, 20 and up to\r\n    50 fleas. One camp doctor employed by me refused to enter the\r\n    camp again after he had been bitten very badly. I visited this\r\n    camp with a Mr. Green on two occasions and both times we left\r\n    the camp badly bitten. We had great difficulty in getting rid of\r\n    the fleas and insects which had attacked us. As a result of this\r\n    attack by insects of this camp, I got large boils on my arms and\r\n    the rest of my body. I asked my superiors at the Krupp works to\r\n    undertake the necessary steps to de-louse the camp so as to put\r\n    an end to this unbearable, vermin-infested condition. Despite\r\n    this report, I did not find any improvement in sanitary\r\n    conditions at the camp on my second visit a fortnight later.\r\n\r\n    “When foreign workers finally became too sick to work or were\r\n    completely disabled they were returned to the Labour Exchange in\r\n    Essen and from there, they were sent to a camp at\r\n    Friedrichsfeld. Among persons who were returned over to the\r\n    Labour Exchange were aggravated cases of tuberculosis, malaria,\r\n    neurosis, career which could not be treated by operation, old\r\n    age, and general feebleness. I know nothing about conditions at\r\n    this camp because I have never visited it. I only know that it\r\n    was a place to which workers who no longer of any use to Krupp\r\n    were sent.\r\n\r\n    “My colleagues and I reported all of the foregoing matters to\r\n    Mr. Ihh, Director of Friedrich Krupp A. G. Dr. Wiels, personal\r\n    physician of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, Senior Camp\r\n    Leader Kupke, and at all times to the health department.\r\n    Moreover, I know that these gentlemen personally visited the\r\n    camps.\r\n\r\n                           “(Signed) Dr. Wilhelm Jager.” (_D-288_)\r\n\r\nThe conditions just described were not confined to the Krupp factories\r\nbut existed throughout Germany. A report of the Polish Main Committee to\r\nthe Administration of the Government-General of Poland, dated 17 May\r\n1944, describes in similar terms the situation of Polish workers in\r\nGermany (_R-103_):\r\n\r\n    “The cleanliness of many overcrowded camp rooms is contrary to\r\n    the most elementary requirements. Often there is no opportunity\r\n    to obtain warm water for washing; therefore the cleanest parents\r\n    are unable to maintain even the most primitive standard of\r\n    hygiene for their children or often even to wash their only set\r\n    of linen. A consequence of this is the spreading of scabies\r\n    which cannot be eradicated * * *\r\n\r\n    “We receive imploring letters from the camps of Eastern workers\r\n    and their prolific families beseeching us for food. The quantity\r\n    and quality of camp rations mentioned therein—the so-called\r\n    fourth grade of rations—is absolutely insufficient to maintain\r\n    the energies spent in heavy work. 3.5 kg. of bread weekly and a\r\n    thin soup at lunch time, cooked with swedes or other vegetables\r\n    without any meat or fat, with a meager addition of potatoes now\r\n    and then is a hunger ration for a heavy worker.\r\n\r\n    “Sometimes punishment consists of starvation which is inflicted,\r\n    i.e. for refusal to wear the badge, ‘East’. Such punishment has\r\n    the result that workers faint at work (Klosterteich Camp,\r\n    Gruenheim, Saxony). The consequence is complete exhaustion, an\r\n    ailing state of health and tuberculosis. The spreading of\r\n    tuberculosis among the Polish factory workers is a result of the\r\n    deficient food rations meted out in the community camps because\r\n    energy spent in heavy work cannot be replaced * * *.\r\n\r\n    “The call for help which reaches us, brings to light starvation\r\n    and hunger, severe stomach intestinal trouble especially in the\r\n    case of children resulting from the insufficiency of food which\r\n    does not take into consideration the needs of children. Proper\r\n    medical treatment or care for the sick are not available in the\r\n    mass camps. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In addition to these bad conditions, there is lack of\r\n    systematic occupation for and supervision of these hosts of\r\n    children which affects the life of prolific families in the\r\n    camps. The children, left to themselves without schooling or\r\n    religious care, must run wild and grow up illiterate. Idleness\r\n    in rough surroundings may and will create unwanted results in\r\n    these children * * *. An indication of the awful conditions this\r\n    may lead to is given by the fact that in the camps for Eastern\r\n    workers—(camp for Eastern workers, ‘Waldlust’, Post Office\r\n    Lauf, Pegnitz)—there are cases of 8-year old delicate and\r\n    undernourished children put to forced labor and perishing from\r\n    such treatment.\r\n\r\n    “The fact that these bad conditions dangerously affect the state\r\n    of health and the vitality of the workers is proved by the many\r\n    cases of tuberculosis found in very young people returning from\r\n    the Reich to the General-Government as unfit for work. Their\r\n    state of health is usually so bad that recovery is out of the\r\n    question. The reason is that a state of exhaustion resulting\r\n    from overwork and a starvation diet is not recognized as an\r\n    ailment until the illness betrays itself by high fever and\r\n    fainting spells.\r\n\r\n    “Although some hostels for unfit workers have been provided as a\r\n    precautionary measure, one can only go there when recovery may\r\n    no longer be expected—(Neumarkt in Bavaria). Even there the\r\n    incurables waste away slowly, and nothing is done even to\r\n    alleviate the state of the sick by suitable food and medicines.\r\n    There are children there with tuberculosis whose cure would not\r\n    be hopeless and men in their prime who if sent home in time to\r\n    their families in rural districts, might still be able to\r\n    recover.\r\n\r\n    “No less suffering is caused by the separation of families when\r\n    wives and mothers of small children are away from their families\r\n    and sent to the Reich for forced labor.* * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “If, under these bad conditions, there is no moral support such\r\n    as is normally based on regular family life, then at least such\r\n    moral support which the religious feelings of the Polish\r\n    population require should be maintained and increased. The\r\n    elimination of religious services, religious practice and\r\n    religious care from the life of the Polish workers, the\r\n    prohibition of church attendance at a time when there is a\r\n    religious service for other people and other measures show a\r\n    certain contempt for the influence of religion on the feelings\r\n    and opinions of the workers.” (_R-103_)\r\n\r\nParticularly harsh and brutal treatment was reserved for workers\r\nimported from the conquered Eastern territories. They lived in bondage,\r\nwere quartered in stables with animals, and were denied the right of\r\nworship and the pleasures of human society. A document entitled\r\n“Directives on the Treatment of Foreign Farmworkers of Polish\r\nNationality”, issued by the Minister for Finance and Economy of Baden on\r\n6 March 1941, describes this treatment (_EC-68_):\r\n\r\n    “The agencies of the Reich Food Administration\r\n    (_Reichsnaehrstand_) State Peasant Association of Baden have\r\n    received the result of the negotiations with the Higher SS and\r\n    Police Officer in Stuttgart on 14 February 1941, with great\r\n    satisfaction. Appropriate memoranda have already been turned\r\n    over to the District Peasants’ Associations. Below, I promulgate\r\n    the individual regulations, as they have been laid down during\r\n    the conference and how they are now to be applied accordingly:\r\n\r\n    “1. Fundamentally, farmworkers of Polish nationality no longer\r\n    have the right to complain, and thus no complaints may be\r\n    accepted any more by any official agency.\r\n\r\n    “2. The farmworkers of Polish nationality may not leave the\r\n    localities in which they are employed, and have a curfew from 1\r\n    October to 31 March from 2000 hours to 0600 hours, and from 1\r\n    April to 30 September from 2100 hours to 0500 hours.\r\n\r\n    “3. The use of bicycles is strictly prohibited. Exceptions are\r\n    possible for riding to the place of work in the field if a\r\n    relative of the employer or the employer himself is present.\r\n\r\n    “4. The visit of churches, regardless of faith, is strictly\r\n    prohibited, even when there is no service in progress.\r\n    Individual spiritual care by clergymen outside of the church is\r\n    permitted.\r\n\r\n    “5. Visits to theaters, motion pictures or other cultural\r\n    entertainment are strictly prohibited for farmworkers of Polish\r\n    nationality.\r\n\r\n    “6. The visit of restaurants is strictly prohibited to\r\n    farmworkers of Polish nationality except for one restaurant in\r\n    the village, which will be selected by the Rural Councillor’s\r\n    office (_Landratsamt_), and then only one day per week. The day,\r\n    which is determined as the day to visit the restaurant, will\r\n    also be determined by the _Landratsamt_. This regulation does\r\n    not change the curfew regulation mentioned above under No. 2.\r\n\r\n    “7. Sexual intercourse with women and girls is strictly\r\n    prohibited, and where it is established, it must be reported.\r\n\r\n    “8. Gatherings of farmworkers of Polish nationality after work\r\n    is prohibited, whether it is on other farms, in the stables, or\r\n    in the living quarters of the Poles.\r\n\r\n    “9. The use of railroads, buses or other public conveyances by\r\n    farmworkers of Polish nationality is prohibited.\r\n\r\n    “10. Permits to leave the village may only be granted in very\r\n    exceptional cases, by the local police authority (Mayor’s\r\n    office). However, in no case may it be granted if he wants to\r\n    visit a public agency on his own, whether it is a labor office\r\n    or the District Peasants Association or whether he wants to\r\n    change his place of employment.\r\n\r\n    “11. Arbitrary change of employment is strictly prohibited. The\r\n    farmworkers of Polish nationality have to work daily so long as\r\n    the interests of the enterprise demands it, and as it is\r\n    demanded by the employer. There are no time limits to the\r\n    working time.\r\n\r\n    “12. Every employer has the right to give corporal punishment\r\n    toward farmworkers of Polish nationality, if instructions and\r\n    good words fail. The employer may not be held accountable in any\r\n    such case by an official agency.\r\n\r\n    “13. Farmworkers of Polish nationality should, if possible, be\r\n    removed from the community of the home and they can be quartered\r\n    in stables, etc. No remorse whatever should restrict such\r\n    action.\r\n\r\n    “14. Report to the authorities is compulsory in all cases, when\r\n    crimes have been committed by farmworkers of Polish nationality,\r\n    which are to sabotage the enterprise or slow down work, for\r\n    instance unwillingness to work, impertinent behavior; it is\r\n    compulsory even in minor cases. An employer, who loses his Pole\r\n    who must serve a longer prison sentence because of such a\r\n    compulsory report, will receive another Pole from the competent\r\n    labor office on request with preference.\r\n\r\n    “15. In all other cases, only the state police is still\r\n    competent.\r\n\r\n    “For the employer himself, severe punishment is contemplated if\r\n    it is established that the necessary distance from farmworkers\r\n    of Polish nationality has not been kept. The same applies to\r\n    women and girls. Extra rations are strictly prohibited.\r\n    Noncompliance to the Reich tariffs for farmworkers of Polish\r\n    nationality will be punished by the competent labor office by\r\n    the taking away of the worker.” (_EC-68_)\r\n\r\nThe women of the conquered territories were led away against their will\r\nto serve as domestics. Sauckel described this program as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In order to relieve considerably the German housewife,\r\n    especially the mother with many children and the extremely busy\r\n    farmwoman, and in order to avoid any further danger to their\r\n    health, the Fuehrer also charged me with procurement of\r\n    400,000-500,000 selected, healthy and strong girls from the\r\n    territories of the East for Germany.” (_016-PS_)\r\n\r\nOnce captured, these Eastern women, by order of Sauckel, were bound to\r\nthe household to which they were assigned, permitted at the most three\r\nhours of freedom a week, and denied the right to return to their homes.\r\nThe decree issued by Sauckel containing instructions for housewives\r\nconcerning Eastern household workers, provides in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * There is no claim for free time. Female domestic workers\r\n    from the East may, on principle, leave the household only to\r\n    take care of domestic tasks. As a reward for good work, however,\r\n    they may be given the opportunity to stay outside the home\r\n    without work for 3 hours once a week. This leave must end with\r\n    the onset of darkness, at the latest at 20:00 hours. It is\r\n    prohibited to enter restaurants, movies, or other theatres and\r\n    similar establishments provided for German or foreign workers.\r\n    Attending church is also prohibited. Special events may be\r\n    arranged for Eastern domestics in urban homes by the German\r\n    Workers’ Front, for Eastern domestics in rural homes by the\r\n    Reich Food Administration with the German Women’s League\r\n    (_Deutsches Frauenwerk_). Outside the home, the Eastern domestic\r\n    must always carry her work card as a personal pass.\r\n\r\n    “10. Vacations, Return to Homes.\r\n\r\n    “Vacations are not granted as yet. The recruiting of Eastern\r\n    domestics is for an indefinite period.” (_3044-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt all times the shadow of the Gestapo and the concentration camp\r\nhovered over the enslaved workers. As with the other major programs of\r\nthe Nazi conspirators, Himmler’s black-shirted SS formations were the\r\ninstruments employed for enforcement. A secret order dated 20 February\r\n1942, issued by Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler to SD and security police\r\nofficers spells out the violence which was applied against the Eastern\r\nworkers. (_3040-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “III. Combatting violations against discipline.\r\n\r\n    “(1) According to the equal status of the manpower from the\r\n    original Soviet Russian territory with prisoners of war, a\r\n    strict discipline must be exercised in the quarters and at the\r\n    working place. Violations against discipline, including work\r\n    refusal and loafing at work, will be fought exclusively by the\r\n    secret State police. The smaller cases will be settled by the\r\n    leader of the guard according to instruction of the State police\r\n    administration offices with measures as provided for in the\r\n    enclosure. To break acute resistance, the guards shall be\r\n    permitted to use also physical power against the manpower. But\r\n    this may be done only for a cogent cause.\r\n\r\n    The manpower should always be informed about the fact that they\r\n    will be treated decently when conducting themselves with\r\n    discipline and accomplishing good work.\r\n\r\n    “(2) In severe cases, that is in such cases where the measures\r\n    at the disposal of the leader of the guard do not suffice, the\r\n    State police office has to act with its means. Accordingly, they\r\n    will be treated, as a rule, only with strict measures, that is\r\n    with transfer to a concentration camp or with special treatment.\r\n\r\n    “(3) The transfer to a concentration camp is done in the usual\r\n    manner.\r\n\r\n    “(4) In especially severe cases special treatment is to be\r\n    requested at the Reich Security Main Office, stating personnel\r\n    data and the exact history of the act.\r\n\r\n    “(5) Special treatment is hanging. It should not take place in\r\n    the immediate vicinity of the camp. A certain number of manpower\r\n    from the original Soviet Russian territory should attend the\r\n    special treatment; at that time they are warned about the\r\n    circumstances which led to this special treatment.\r\n\r\n    “(6) Should special treatment be required within the camp for\r\n    exceptional reasons of camp discipline, this is also to be\r\n    requested.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “VI. Sexual Intercourse.\r\n\r\n    “Sexual intercourse is forbidden to the manpower of the original\r\n    Soviet Russian territory. By means of their closely confined\r\n    quarters they have no opportunity for it. Should sexual\r\n    intercourse be exercised nevertheless—especially among the\r\n    individually employed manpower on the farms—the following is\r\n    directed:\r\n\r\n    “(1) For every case of sexual intercourse with German countrymen\r\n    or women, special treatment is to be requested for male manpower\r\n    from the original Soviet Russian territory, transfer to a\r\n    concentration camp for female manpower.\r\n\r\n    “(2) When exercising sexual intercourse with other foreign\r\n    workers, the conduct of the manpower from the original Soviet\r\n    Russian territory is to be punished as severe violation of\r\n    discipline with transfer to a concentration camp.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “VIII. Search.\r\n\r\n    “(1) Fugitive workers from the original Soviet Russian territory\r\n    are to be announced principally in the German search book\r\n    (_Fanndungsbuch_). Furthermore, search measures are to be\r\n    decreed locally.\r\n\r\n    “(2) When caught, the fugitive must receive special treatment *\r\n    * *.” (_3040-PS_)\r\n\r\n             6. USE OF SLAVE LABOR IN GERMAN WAR INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the slave labor program was to compel the people\r\nof the occupied countries to work for the German war economy. The decree\r\nappointing Sauckel Plenipotentiary-General for Manpower declares the\r\npurpose of the appointment to be to facilitate acquisition of the\r\nmanpower required for German war industries, and in particular the\r\narmaments industry, by centralizing under Sauckel responsibility for the\r\nrecruitment and allocation of foreign labor and prisoners of war in\r\nthese industries (_1666-PS_). This decree, signed by Hitler, Lammers and\r\nKeitel, and dated 21 March 1942, provides:\r\n\r\n    “In order to secure the manpower requisite for the war\r\n    industries as a whole, and particularly for armaments, it is\r\n    necessary that the utilization of all available manpower,\r\n    including that of workers recruited (_angeworbenen_) abroad and\r\n    of prisoners of war, should be subject to a uniform control,\r\n    directed in a manner appropriate to the requirements of war\r\n    industry, and further that all still incompletely utilized\r\n    manpower in the Greater German Reich, including the\r\n    Protectorate, and in the General Government and in the occupied\r\n    territories should be mobilized.\r\n\r\n    “_Reichsstatthalter_ and _Gauleiter_ Fritz Sauckel will carry\r\n    out this task within the framework of the Four Year Plan, as\r\n    Plenipotentiary General, for the utilization of labor. In that\r\n    capacity he will be directly responsible to the Commissioner for\r\n    the Four Year Plan.\r\n\r\n    “Section III (Wages) and Section V (Utilization of labor) of the\r\n    Reich Labor Ministry, together with their subordinate\r\n    authorities, will be placed at the disposal of the\r\n    Plenipotentiary General for the accomplishment of his task.”\r\n    (_1666-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel’s success can be gauged from a letter he wrote to Hitler on 15\r\nApril 1943, containing a report on one year’s activities:\r\n\r\n    “1. After one year’s activity as Plenipotentiary for the\r\n    Direction of Labor, I can report that 3,638,056 new foreign\r\n    workers were given to the German war economy from 1 April of\r\n    last year to 31 March this year.\r\n\r\n    “2. The 3,638,056 are distributed amongst the following branches\r\n    of the German war economy\r\n\r\n    Armament—1,568,801.” (_407-VI-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of this use of enslaved foreign labor is found in a\r\nreport of a meeting of the Central Planning Board on 16 February 1944,\r\nduring which Field Marshal Milch stated:\r\n\r\n    “The armament industry employs foreign workmen to a large\r\n    extent; according to the latest figures—40 percent.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nMoreover, according to tabulations of Speer’s Ministry, as of 31\r\nDecember 1944 approximately two million civilian foreign workers were\r\nemployed directly in the manufacture of armaments and munitions (end\r\nproducts or components). (_2520-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel, Speer, and Keitel also succeeded in forcing foreign labor to\r\nconstruct military fortifications. Thus, citizens of France, Holland,\r\nand Belgium were compelled against their will to engage in the\r\nconstruction of the “Atlantic Wall”. Hitler, in an order dated 8\r\nSeptember 1942, initialed by Keitel, decreed that:\r\n\r\n    “The extensive coastal fortifications which I have ordered to be\r\n    erected in the area of Army Group West make it necessary that in\r\n    the occupied territory all available workers should be committed\r\n    and should give the fullest extent of their productive\r\n    capacities. The previous allotment of domestic workers is\r\n    insufficient. In order to increase it, I order the introduction\r\n    of compulsory labor and the prohibition of changing the place of\r\n    employment without permission of the authorities in the occupied\r\n    territories. Furthermore, the distribution of food and clothing\r\n    ration cards to those subject to labor draft should in the\r\n    future depend on the possession of a certificate of employment.\r\n    Refusal to accept an assigned job, as well as abandoning the\r\n    place of work without the consent of the authorities in charge,\r\n    will result in the withdrawal of the food and clothing ration\r\n    cards. The GBA (Deputy General for _Arbeitseinsatz_) in\r\n    agreement with the military commander as well as the Reich\r\n    Commissar, will issue the corresponding decrees for execution.”\r\n    (_556-2-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel boasted to Hitler concerning the contribution of the forced\r\nlabor program to the construction of the Atlantic Wall by Speer’s\r\nOrganization Todt (OT). In a letter to Hitler dated 17 May 1943, Sauckel\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In addition to the labor allotted to the total German\r\n    economy by the Arbeitseinsatz since I took office, the\r\n    Organization Todt was supplied with new labor continually. * * *\r\n\r\n    “Thus, the Arbeitseinsatz has done everything to help make\r\n    possible the completion of the Atlantic Wall.” (_407-VIII-PS_)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Russian civilians were forced into labor battalions and\r\ncompelled to build fortifications to be used against their own\r\ncountrymen. A memorandum of the Rosenberg Ministry states that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * men and women in the theaters of operations have been and\r\n    will be conscripted into labor battalions to be used in the\r\n    construction of fortifications * * *.” (_031-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Nazi conspirators compelled Prisoners of War to engage\r\nin operations of war against their own country and its Allies. At a\r\nmeeting of the Central Planning Board held on February 19, 1943,\r\nattended by Speer, Sauckel, and Field Marshal Milch, the following\r\nconversation occurred:\r\n\r\n    “Sauckel: If any prisoners are taken, there, they will be\r\n    needed.\r\n\r\n    “Milch: We have made a request for an order that a certain\r\n    percentage of men in the antiaircraft artillery must be\r\n    Russians. 50,000 will be taken altogether; 30,000 are already\r\n    employed as gunners. This is an amusing thing that Russians must\r\n    work the guns.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\n(At this point a series of official German Army photographs were offered\r\nin evidence. The first one shows Russian Prisoners of War acting as\r\nammunition bearers during the attack upon Tschudowo. The second group\r\nconsists of a series of official German Army photographs taken in July\r\nand August 1941 showing Russian prisoners of war in Latvia and the\r\nUkraine being compelled to load and unload ammunition trains and trucks\r\nand being required to stack ammunition.)\r\n\r\nThis use of prisoners of war was in flagrant disregard of the rules of\r\ninternational law, particularly Article 6 of the Regulations annexed to\r\nHague Convention Number 4 of 1907, which provides that the tasks of\r\nprisoners of war shall have no connection with the operations of war.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators made extensive use of prisoners of war not only in\r\nactive operations of war but also in the German armament industry. A\r\nsecret letter from the Reichminister of Labor to the Presidents of the\r\nRegional Labor Exchange Offices refers to an order of Goering to the\r\neffect that:\r\n\r\n    “Upon personal order of the Reich Marshal, 100,000 men are to be\r\n    taken from among the French PWs not yet employed in armament\r\n    industry, and are to be assigned to the armament industry\r\n    (airplanes industry). Gaps in manpower supply resulting\r\n    therefrom will be filled by Soviet PWs. The transfer of the\r\n    above-named French PWs is to be accomplished by 1 October.”\r\n    (_3005-PS_)\r\n\r\nA similar policy was followed with respect to Russian prisoners of war.\r\nIn a secret memorandum issued from Hitler’s headquarters on 31 October\r\n1942, Keitel directed the execution of Hitler’s order to use such\r\nprisoners in the German war economy (_EC-194_):\r\n\r\n    “The lack of workers is becoming an increasingly dangerous\r\n    hindrance for the future German war and armament industry. The\r\n    expected relief through discharges from the armed forces is\r\n    uncertain as to the extent and date; however, its possible\r\n    extent will by no means correspond to expectations and\r\n    requirements in view of the great demand.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer has now ordered that even the working power of the\r\n    Russian prisoner of war should be utilized to a large extent by\r\n    large scale assignment for the requirements of the war industry.\r\n    The prerequisite for production is adequate nourishment. Also\r\n    very small wages are to be planned for the most modest supply\r\n    with a few consumers’ goods (_Genussmittel_) for every day’s\r\n    life, eventual rewards for production.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “II. _Construction and Armament Industry._\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Work units for constructions of all kind, particularly for\r\n    the fortification of coastal defenses (concrete workers,\r\n    unloading units for essential war plants).\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Suitable armament factories which have to be selected in\r\n    such a way that their personnel should consist in the majority\r\n    of prisoners of war under guidance and supervision (eventually\r\n    after withdrawal and other employment of the German workers).\r\n\r\n    “III. _Other War Industries._\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Mining as under II _b._\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Railroad construction units for building tracks etc.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Agriculture and forestry in closed units.

The Top\r\nSecret notes on Goering’s instructions as to the employment and\r\ntreatment of prisoners of war in many phases of the German war industry\r\nread as follows (_1206-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer’s point of view as to employment of prisoners of\r\n    war in war industries has changed basically. So far a total of 5\r\n    million prisoners of war—employed so far 2 million.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “For 4) _In the Interior and the Protectorate_, it would be\r\n    ideal if entire factories could be manned by Russian PW’s except\r\n    the employees necessary for direction. For employment in the\r\n    Interior and the Protectorate the following are to have\r\n    priority:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ _At the top coal mining industry._\r\n\r\n    “Order by the Fuehrer to investigate all mines as to suitability\r\n    for employment of Russians. At times manning the entire plant\r\n    with Russian laborers.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ _Transportation_ (construction of locomotives and cars,\r\n    repair shops).\r\n\r\n    “Railroad-repair and industry workers are to be sought out from\r\n    the PW’s.

Use in factories of tool\r\n    machinery, production of farm tractors, generators, etc. In\r\n    emergency, erect in individual places barracks for occasional\r\n    workers which are used as unloading details and similar\r\n    purposes.

In a speech to the Nazi Gauleiters on 24 February\r\n1942, Speer said:\r\n\r\n    “I therefore proposed to the Fuehrer at the end of December that\r\n    all my labor force, including specialists be released for mass\r\n    employment in the East. Subsequently the remaining PW’s, about\r\n    10,000 were put at disposal of the armaments industry by me.”\r\n    (_1435-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpeer also reported at the 36th meeting of the Central Planning Board,\r\nheld on 22 April 1943, that only 30% of the Russian prisoners of war\r\nwere engaged in the armament industry. This he found unsatisfactory.\r\nSpeer continued:\r\n\r\n    “There is a specified statement showing in what sectors the\r\n    Russian PW’s have been distributed, and this statement is quite\r\n    interesting. It shows that the armaments industry only received\r\n    30%. I always complained about this.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The 90,000 Russian PW’s employed in the whole of the armaments\r\n    industry are for the greatest part skilled men.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nSauckel, who was appointed Plenipotentiary General for the utilization\r\nof labor for the express purpose, among others, of integrating prisoners\r\nof war into the German war industry, made it plain that prisoners of war\r\nwere to be compelled to serve the German armament industry. His labor\r\nmobilization program contains the following statement:\r\n\r\n    “All prisoners of war, from the territories of the West as well\r\n    as of the East, actually in Germany, must be completely\r\n    incorporated into the German armament and nutrition industries.\r\n    Their production must be brought to the highest possible level.”\r\n    (_016-PS_)\r\n\r\n    7. THE CONCENTRATION CAMP PROGRAM OF EXTERMINATION THROUGH WORK\r\n\r\nA special Nazi program combined the brutality and the purposes of the\r\nslave labor program with those of the concentration camp. The Nazis\r\nplaced Allied nationals in concentration camps and forced them, along\r\nwith the other inmates of the concentration camps, to work in the\r\narmaments industry under conditions designed to exterminate them. This\r\nwas the Nazi program of extermination through work.\r\n\r\nThe program was initiated in the spring of 1942. It was outlined as\r\nfollows in a letter to Himmler, dated 30 April 1942, from his\r\nsubordinate Pohl, SS Obergruppenfuehrer and General of the Waffen SS:\r\n\r\n    “Today I report about the present situation of the concentration\r\n    camps and about measures I have taken to carry out your order of\r\n    the 3rd March 1942.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “1. The war has brought about a marked change in the structure\r\n    of the concentration camps and has changed their duties with\r\n    regard to the employment of the prisoners. The custody of\r\n    prisoners for the sole reasons of security, education, or\r\n    prevention is no longer the main consideration. The mobilization\r\n    of all prisoners who are fit for work for purposes of the war\r\n    now, and for purposes of construction in the forthcoming peace,\r\n    come to the foreground more and more.\r\n\r\n    “2. From this knowledge some necessary measures result with the\r\n    aim to transform the concentration camps into organizations more\r\n    suitable for the economic tasks, whilst they were formerly\r\n    merely politically interested.\r\n\r\n    “3. For this reason I have gathered together all the leaders of\r\n    the former inspectorate of Concentration Camps, all Camp\r\n    Commanders, and all managers and supervisors of work on the 23rd\r\n    and 24th of April, 1942; I have explained personally to them\r\n    this new development. I have compiled in the order attached the\r\n    main essentials, which have to be brought into effect with the\r\n    utmost urgency if the commencement of work for purposes of the\r\n    armament industry is not to be delayed.” (_R-129_)\r\n\r\nThe order referred to in paragraph 3 above set the framework for a\r\nprogram of relentless exploitation, providing in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “4. The camp commander alone is responsible for the employment\r\n    of the labor available. This employment must be, in the true\r\n    meaning of the word, exhaustive, in order to obtain the greatest\r\n    measure of performance. Work is allotted by the Chief of the\r\n    Department D centrally and alone. The camp-commanders themselves\r\n    may not accept on their own initiative work offered by third\r\n    parties and may not negotiate about it.\r\n\r\n    “5. There is no limit to working hours. Their duration depends\r\n    on the kind of working establishments in the camps and the kind\r\n    of work to be done. They are fixed by the camp commanders alone.\r\n\r\n    “6. Any circumstances which may result in a shortening of\r\n    working hours (e.g. meals, roll-calls) have therefore to be\r\n    restricted to the minimum which cannot be condensed any more. It\r\n    is forbidden to allow long walks to the place of working and\r\n    noon intervals only for eating purposes.” (_R-129_)\r\n\r\nThis armaments production program was not merely a scheme for mobilizing\r\nthe manpower potential of the camps. It was directly integrated into the\r\nlarger Nazi program of extermination. A memorandum of an agreement\r\nbetween Himmler and the Minister of Justice, Thierack sets for the Nazi\r\nobjective of extermination through work:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 2. The delivery of anti-social elements from the\r\n    execution of their sentence to the Reich Fuehrer of SS to be\r\n    worked to death. Persons under protective arrest, Jews, Gypsies,\r\n    Russians and Ukrainians, Poles with more than 3-year sentences,\r\n    Czechs and Germans with more than 8-year sentences, according to\r\n    the decision of the Reich Minister for Justice. First of all the\r\n    worst anti-social elements amongst those just mentioned are to\r\n    be handed over. I shall inform the Fuehrer of this through\r\n    Reichsleiter Bormann.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “14. It is agreed that, in consideration of the intended aims of\r\n    the Government for the clearing up of the Eastern problems, in\r\n    future Jews, Poles, Gypsies, Russians and Ukrainians are no\r\n    longer to be judged by the ordinary courts, so far as punishable\r\n    offenses are concerned, but are to be dealt with by the Reich\r\n    Fuehrer of SS. This does not apply to civil lawsuits, nor to\r\n    Poles whose names are announced or entered in the German Racial\r\n    Lists.” (_654-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn September, 1942, Speer arranged to bring this new source of labor\r\nwithin his jurisdiction. Speer convinced Hitler that significant\r\nproduction could be obtained only if the concentration camp prisoners\r\nwere employed in factories under the technical control of the Speer\r\nMinistry instead of in camps. In fact, without Speer’s cooperation, it\r\nwould have been difficult to utilize the prisoners on any large scale\r\nfor war production since he would not allocate to Himmler the machine\r\ntools and other necessary equipment. Accordingly, it was agreed that the\r\nprisoners were to be exploited in factories under Speer’s control. To\r\ncompensate Himmler for surrendering this jurisdiction to Speer, Speer\r\nproposed, and Hitler agreed, that Himmler would receive a share of the\r\narmaments output, fixed in relation to the man hours contributed by his\r\nprisoners. The minutes of Speer’s conference with Hitler on 20, 21, 22\r\nSeptember 1942, are as follows (_R-124_):\r\n\r\n    “* * * I pointed out to the Fuehrer that, apart from an\r\n    insignificant amount of work, no possibility exists of\r\n    organizing armament production in the concentration camps,\r\n    because:\r\n\r\n    “1. the machine tools required are missing,\r\n\r\n    “2. there are no suitable premises.\r\n\r\n    “Both these assets would be available in the armaments industry,\r\n    if use could be made of them by a second shift.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer agrees to my proposal, that the numerous factories\r\n    set up outside towns for ARP reasons, should release their\r\n    workers for supplementing the second shift in town factories and\r\n    should in return be supplied with labor from the concentration\r\n    camps—also two shifts.\r\n\r\n    “I pointed out to the Fuehrer the difficulties which I expect to\r\n    encounter if Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler should be able, as he\r\n    requests, to exercise authoritative influence over these\r\n    factories. The Fuehrer, too, does not consider such an influence\r\n    necessary.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer however agrees that Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler should\r\n    draw advantages from making his prisoners available; he should\r\n    get equipment for his division.\r\n\r\n    “I suggest to give him a share in kind (war equipment) in ratio\r\n    to the working hours done by his prisoners. A 3-5% share is\r\n    discussed, the equipment also being calculated according to\r\n    working hours. The Fuehrer would agree to such a solution.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer is prepared to order the additional delivery of\r\n    this equipment and weapons to the SS, according to a list\r\n    submitted to him.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nAfter a demand for concentration camp labor had been created, and a\r\nmechanism set up by Speer for exploiting this labor in armament\r\nfactories, measures were evolved for increasing the supply of victims\r\nfor extermination through work. A steady flow was assured by the\r\nagreement between Himmler and the Minister of Justice mentioned above.\r\nThis was implemented by such programs as the following, expressed in\r\nSauckel’s letter of 26 November 1942 to Presidents of Landes Employment\r\nOffices regarding the program for the evacuation of Poles from the\r\nLublin district:\r\n\r\n    “The Poles who are to be evacuated as a result of this measure\r\n    will be put into concentration camps and put to work where they\r\n    are criminal or asocial elements.” (_L-61_)\r\n\r\nGeneral measures were supplemented by special drives for persons who\r\nwould not otherwise have been sent to concentration camps. For example,\r\nfor “reasons of war necessity” Himmler ordered on 17 December 1942 that\r\nat least 35,000 prisoners qualified for work should be transferred\r\nimmediately to concentration camps, (_1063-D-PS_). The order provided\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n    “For reasons of war necessity not to be discussed further here,\r\n    the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police on 14\r\n    December 1942 has ordered that until the end of January 1943, at\r\n    least 35,000 prisoners qualified for work, are to be sent to the\r\n    concentration camps. In order to reach this number, the\r\n    following measures are required:\r\n\r\n    “1. As of now (so far until 1 Feb. 1943) all eastern workers or\r\n    such foreign workers who have been fugitives, or who have broken\r\n    contracts, and who do not belong to allied, friendly or neutral\r\n    States are to be brought by the quickest means to the nearest\r\n    concentration camps * * *.\r\n\r\n    “2. The commanders and the commandants of the security police\r\n    and the security service, and the chiefs of the State Police\r\n    Headquarters will check immediately on the basis of a close and\r\n    strict ruling\r\n\r\n    _a._ the prisons\r\n\r\n    _b._ the labor reformatory camps\r\n\r\n    “All prisoners qualified for work, if it is essentially and\r\n    humanly possible, will be committed at once to the nearest\r\n    concentration camp, according to the following instructions, for\r\n    instance also if penal procedures were to be established in the\r\n    near future. Only such prisoners who in the interest of\r\n    investigation procedures are to remain absolutely in solitary\r\n    confinement can be left there.\r\n\r\n    “_Every single laborer counts!_” (_1063-D-PS_)\r\n\r\nMeasures were also adopted to insure that extermination through work was\r\npracticed with maximum efficiency. Subsidiary concentration camps were\r\nestablished near important war plants. Speer has admitted that he\r\npersonally toured Upper Austria and selected sites for concentration\r\ncamps near various munitions factories in the area. This admission\r\nappears in the transcript of an interrogation of Speer under oath on 18\r\nOctober 1945, in which Speer stated:\r\n\r\n    “The fact that we were anxious to use workers from concentration\r\n    camps in factories and to establish small concentration camps\r\n    near the factories in order to use the manpower that was\r\n    available there was a general fact. But it did not only come up\r\n    in connection with this trip.” [i.e. Speer’s trip to Austria].\r\n    (_3720-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering endorsed this use of concentration camp labor and asked for\r\nmore. In a teletype which Goering sent to Himmler on 14 February 1944,\r\nhe stated:\r\n\r\n    “At the same time I ask you to put at my disposal as great a\r\n    number of concentration camp (KZ-) convicts as possible for air\r\n    armament, as this kind of manpower proved to be very useful\r\n    according to previous experience. The situation of the air war\r\n    makes subterranean transfer of industry necessary. For work of\r\n    this kind concentration camp (KZ-) convicts can be especially\r\n    well concentrated at work and in the camp.” (_1584-I-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpeer subsequently assumed responsibility for this program, and Hitler\r\npromised Speer that if the necessary labor for the program could not be\r\nobtained, a hundred thousand Hungarian Jews would be brought in by the\r\nSS. Speer’s record of conferences with Hitler on April 6 and 7, 1944,\r\ncontain the following quotation:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Suggested to the Fuehrer that, due to lack of builders\r\n    and equipment, the second big building project should not be set\r\n    up in German territory, but in close vicinity to the border on\r\n    suitable soil (preferable on gravel base and with transport\r\n    facilities) on French, Belgian or Dutch territory. The Fuehrer\r\n    agrees to this suggestion if the works could be set up behind a\r\n    fortified zone. For the suggestion of setting this plant up in\r\n    French territory speaks mainly the fact that it would be much\r\n    easier to procure the necessary workers. Nevertheless, the\r\n    Fuehrer asks an attempt be made to set up the second works in a\r\n    safer area, namely in the Protectorate. If it should prove\r\n    impossible there, too, to get hold of the necessary workers, the\r\n    Fuehrer himself will contact the Reichsfuehrer SS and will give\r\n    an order that the required 100,000 men are to be made available\r\n    by bringing in Jews from Hungary. Stressing the fact that the\r\n    building organization of the _Industriegemeinschaft Schlesien\r\n    Silesia_ was a failure, the Fuehrer demands that these works\r\n    must be built by the O.T. exclusively and that the workers\r\n    should be made available by the Reichsfuehrer SS. He wants to\r\n    hold a meeting shortly in order to discuss details with all the\r\n    men concerned.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nThe character of the treatment inflicted on Allied nationals and other\r\nvictims of concentration camps while they were being worked to death is\r\ndescribed in an official report prepared by a U.S. Congressional\r\nCommittee which inspected the liberated camps at the request of General\r\nEisenhower (_L-159_). The report states in part:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The treatment accorded to these prisoners in the\r\n    concentration camps was generally as follows: They were herded\r\n    together in some wooden barracks not large enough for one-tenth\r\n    of their number. They were forced to sleep on wooden frames\r\n    covered with wooden boards in tiers of two, three and even four,\r\n    sometimes with no covering, sometimes with a bundle of dirty\r\n    rags serving both as pallet and coverlet.\r\n\r\n    “Their food consisted generally of about one-half of a pound of\r\n    black bread per day and a bowl of watery soup for noon and\r\n    night, and not always that. Owing to the great numbers crowded\r\n    into a small space and to the lack of adequate sustenance, lice\r\n    and vermin multiplied, disease became rampant, and those who did\r\n    not soon die of disease or torture began the long, slow process\r\n    of starvation. Notwithstanding the deliberate starvation program\r\n    inflicted upon these prisoners by lack of adequate food, we\r\n    found no evidence that the people of Germany as a whole were\r\n    suffering from any lack of sufficient food or clothing. The\r\n    contrast was so striking that the only conclusion which we could\r\n    reach was that the starvation of the inmates of these camps was\r\n    deliberate.\r\n\r\n    “Upon entrance into these camps, newcomers were forced to work\r\n    either at an adjoining war factory or were placed ‘in commando’\r\n    on various jobs in the vicinity, being returned each night to\r\n    their stall in the barracks. Generally a German criminal was\r\n    placed in charge of each ‘block’ or shed in which the prisoners\r\n    slept. Periodically he would choose the one prisoner of his\r\n    block who seemed the most alert or intelligent or showed the\r\n    most leadership qualities. These would report to the guards’\r\n    room and would never be heard from again. The generally-accepted\r\n    belief of the prisoners was that these were shot or gassed or\r\n    hanged and then cremated. A refusal to work or an infraction of\r\n    the rules usually meant flogging and other types of torture,\r\n    such as having the fingernails pulled out, and in each case\r\n    usually ended in death after extensive suffering. The policies\r\n    herein described constituted a calculated and diabolical program\r\n    of planned torture and extermination on the part of those who\r\n    were in control of the German Government * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “On the whole, we found this camp to have been operated and\r\n    administered much in the same manner as Buchenwald had been\r\n    operated and managed. When the efficiency of the workers\r\n    decreased as a result of the conditions under which they were\r\n    required to live, their rations were decreased as punishment.\r\n    This brought about a vicious circle in which the weak became\r\n    weaker and were ultimately exterminated.” (_L-159_)\r\n\r\nSuch was the cycle of work, torture, starvation and death for\r\nconcentration camp labor—labor which Goering, while requesting that\r\nmore of it be placed at his disposal, said had proved very useful; labor\r\nwhich Speer was “anxious” to use in the factories under his control.\r\n\r\n                8. THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF SAUCKEL\r\n\r\nSauckel bears special responsibility for the Nazi slave labor program\r\nand the manner in which it was executed. Sauckel was appointed as\r\nPlenipotentiary General for Manpower because he was an old and trusted\r\nNazi. He has certified, on 17 November 1945, that he held the following\r\npositions:\r\n\r\n    “1. Member of _Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Arbeiterpartei_\r\n    (1925-1945). (Member of National Socialist German Workers Party.\r\n    Member No. 1395.)\r\n\r\n    2. Member of Reichstag (_Mitglied des Reichstags_) (1933-1945).\r\n\r\n    3.

SA Obergruppenfuehrer (November 1937-1945).\r\n\r\n    8. SS Obergruppenfuehrer (January 1942-1945).\r\n\r\n    9. Administrator Berlin-Suhler Waffen & Fahrzeugwerke (1935).\r\n\r\n    10. Head of Gustloff-Werke Nationalsozialistische\r\n    Industrie-Stiftung (1936). Honorary Head of Foundation.\r\n\r\n    11. General Plenipotentiary for Labor Allocation\r\n    (_Generalbevollmaechtigter fuer den Arbeitseinsatz_) (21 March\r\n    1942-1945).” (_2974-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel’s official responsibilities are borne out by other evidence. His\r\nappointment as Plenipotentiary-General for Manpower was effected by a\r\ndecree of 21 March 1942 signed by Hitler, Lammers, and Keitel. By that\r\ndecree (_1666-PS_) Sauckel was given authority as well as responsibility\r\nsubordinate only to that of Hitler and Goering for all matters relating\r\nto recruitment, allocation, and handling of foreign and domestic\r\nmanpower. Goering, to whom Sauckel was directly responsible, abolished\r\nthe recruitment and allocation agencies for the Four Year Plan,\r\ndelegated their powers to Sauckel and placed his far-reaching authority,\r\nas deputy for the Four Year Plan, at Sauckel’s disposal. This was the\r\nresult of Goering’s decree dated 27 March 1942 (_1666-PS_) and providing\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “In pursuance of the Fuehrer’s Decree of 21 March 1942 (RGBl I,\r\n    179), I decree as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. My manpower sections (_Geschaeftsgruppen Arbeitseinsatz_)\r\n    are hereby abolished (circular letter of 22 Oct 1936/St M. Dev.\r\n    265). Their duties (recruitment and allocation of manpower,\r\n    regulations for labor conditions (_Arbeitsbedingungen_)) are\r\n    taken over by the Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz,\r\n    who is directly under me.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Plenipotentiary General for _Arbeitseinsatz_ will be\r\n    responsible for regulating the conditions of labor (wage policy)\r\n    employed in the Reich Territory, having regard to the\r\n    requirements of _Arbeitseinsatz_.\r\n\r\n    “3. The Plenipotentiary General for _Arbeitseinsatz_ is part of\r\n    the Four Year Plan. In cases where new legislation is required,\r\n    or existing laws required to be modified, he will submit\r\n    appropriate proposals to me.\r\n\r\n    “4. The Plenipotentiary General for _Arbeitseinsatz_ will have\r\n    at his disposal for the performance of his task the right\r\n    delegated to me by the Fuehrer for issuing instructions to the\r\n    higher Reich authorities, their branches and the Party offices,\r\n    and their associated organisms and also the Reich Protector, the\r\n    General Governor, the Commander-in-Chief, and heads of the civil\r\n    administrations. In the case of ordinances and instructions of\r\n    fundamental importance a report is to be submitted to me in\r\n    advance.” (_1666-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy a Hitler decree of 30 September 1942 Sauckel was given extraordinary\r\npowers over the civil and military authorities of the territories\r\noccupied by Germany. The decree (_1903-PS_) provided as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I herewith authorize the Deputy General for the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_, Reich-governor and district leader (Gauleiter)\r\n    Fritz Sauckel to take all necessary measures for the enforcement\r\n    of my decree referring to a Deputy General for the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_ of 21 March 1942 (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, I, page\r\n    179) according to his own judgment in the Greater German Reich,\r\n    in the Protectorate, and in the Government General\r\n    (_General-gouvernement_) as well as in the occupied territories,\r\n    measures which will safeguard under all circumstances the\r\n    regulated deployment of labor (_Geordneter Arbeitseinsatz_) for\r\n    the German war-economy. For this purpose he may appoint\r\n    commissioners (_Beauftragte_) to the bureaux of the military and\r\n    civilian administration. These are subordinated directly to\r\n    Deputy General for the _Arbeitseinsatz_. In order to carry out\r\n    their tasks, they are entitled to issue directives to the\r\n    competent military and civilian authorities in charge of the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_ and of wage-policy.\r\n\r\n    “More detailed directives will be issued by the Deputy General\r\n    for the _Arbeitseinsatz_.\r\n\r\n    “Fuehrer-Headquarters, 30 Sept. 1942.\r\n\r\n                                                     “The Fuehrer\r\n                             “(signed)  Adolph Hitler.” (_1903-PS_)\r\n\r\nWithin a month after his appointment, Sauckel sent Rosenberg his “Labor\r\nMobilization Program”, which might more appropriately be termed\r\nSauckel’s “Charter of Enslavement.” This program envisaged the forcible\r\nrecruitment and the maximum exploitation of the entire labor resources\r\nof the conquered areas and of prisoners of war in the interests of the\r\nNazi war machine, at the lowest conceivable degree of expenditure to the\r\nGerman State. Sauckel explained his plans in these terms:\r\n\r\n    “It must be emphasized, however, that an additional tremendous\r\n    number of foreign labor has to be found for the Reich. The\r\n    greatest pool for that purpose are the occupied territories of\r\n    the East. Consequently, it is an immediate necessity to use the\r\n    human reserves of the Conquered Soviet Territory to the fullest\r\n    extent. Should we not succeed in obtaining the necessary amount\r\n    of labor on a voluntary basis, we must immediately institute\r\n    conscription or forced labor.\r\n\r\n    “Apart from the prisoners of war still in the occupied\r\n    territories, we must, therefore, requisition skilled or\r\n    unskilled male and female labor from the Soviet territory from\r\n    the age of 15 up for the labor mobilization * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The complete employment of all prisoners of war as well as the\r\n    use of a gigantic number of new foreign civilian workers, men\r\n    and women, has become an undisputable necessity for the solution\r\n    of the mobilization of labor program in this war.” (_016-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel proceeded to implement this “Charter of Enslavement” with\r\ncertain basic directives. In Regulation No. 4, which he issued on 7 May\r\n1942, Sauckel provided that if voluntary recruitment of foreign workers\r\nwas unsuccessful, compulsory service should be instituted. This\r\nregulation provides:\r\n\r\n    “The recruitment of foreign labor will be done on the\r\n    fundamental basis of volunteering. Where, however, in the\r\n    occupied territories the appeal for volunteers does not suffice,\r\n    obligatory service and drafting must, under all circumstances,\r\n    be resorted to. This is an indisputable requirement of our labor\r\n    situation.” (_3044-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel provided also for the allocation of foreign labor in the order\r\nof its importance to the Nazi war machine. Sauckel’s regulation No. 10\r\nof 22 August 1942 had these aims:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 3. The resources of manpower that are available in the\r\n    occupied territories are to be employed primarily to satisfy the\r\n    requirements of importance for the war, in Germany itself. In\r\n    allocating the said labor resources in the Occupied Territories,\r\n    the following order of priority will be observed:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Labor required for the troops, the occupation\r\n    authorities, and the civil authorities;\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Labor required for the German armaments (_Ruestungen_);\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) Labor required for food and agriculture;\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) Labor required for industrial work other than armaments,\r\n    which is in the interest of Germany;\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) Labor required for industrial work in the interests of\r\n    the population of the territory in question.” (_3044-A-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel and agencies subordinate to him exercised exclusive authority\r\nover the recruitment of workers from every area in Europe occupied by,\r\ncontrolled by, or friendly to the German nation. Sauckel affirmed this\r\nauthority in the following decree:\r\n\r\n    “The recruitment of foreign labor in the areas occupied by\r\n    Germany, in allied, friendly or neutral states will be carried\r\n    out exclusively by my commissioners, or by the competent German\r\n    military or civil agencies for the tasks of labor mobilization.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “For the carrying out of recruitment in allied, friendly or\r\n    neutral foreign countries, my commissioners are solely\r\n    responsible.” (_3044-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel participated in the formulation of overall labor requirements\r\nfor Germany and assigned quotas to be filled by and with the assistance\r\nof the individuals and agencies mentioned above, with knowledge that\r\nforce and brutality were the only means whereby his demands could be\r\nmet. Thus, the Lammer’s report states (_1292-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “1. A conference took place with the Fuehrer today which was\r\n    attended by:\r\n\r\n    “The Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor Gauleiter\r\n    Sauckel,\r\n\r\n    “The Secretary for Armament and War Production, Speer,\r\n\r\n    “The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Army, General Field\r\n    Marshal Keitel, General Field Marshal Milch,\r\n\r\n    “The Acting Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture State\r\n    Secretary Backe,\r\n\r\n    “The Minister of the Interior, Reichfuehrer SS Himmler, and\r\n    myself.\r\n\r\n    (The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of National\r\n    Economy had repeatedly asked to be permitted to participate\r\n    prior to the Conference, but the Fuehrer did not wish their\r\n    attendance.)\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer declared in his introductory remarks:\r\n\r\n        ‘I want a clear picture:\r\n\r\n        (1) How many workers are required for the maintenance of\r\n        German War Economy?\r\n\r\n        (_a_) For the maintenance of present output?\r\n\r\n        (_b_) To increase its output?\r\n\r\n        (2) How many workers can be obtained from Occupied\r\n        Countries, or how many can still be gained in the Reich\r\n        by suitable means (increased output)? For one thing, it\r\n        is this matter of making up for losses by death,\r\n        infirmity, the constant fluctuation of workers, and so\r\n        forth, and further it is a matter of procuring\r\n        additional workers.’\r\n\r\n    “The Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor, Sauckel,\r\n    declared that, in order to maintain the present pool of workers,\r\n    he would have to add at least 2½ but probably 3 million new\r\n    workers in 1944. Otherwise production would fall off.\r\n    Reichsminister Speer declared that he needs an additional 1.3\r\n    million laborers. However, this would depend on whether it will\r\n    be possible to increase production of iron ore. Should this not\r\n    be possible, he would need no additional workers. Procurement of\r\n    additional workers from Occupied Territory would, however, be\r\n    subject to the condition that these workers will not be\r\n    withdrawn from armament and auxiliary industries already working\r\n    there. For this would mean a decrease of production of these\r\n    industries which he could not tolerate. Those, for instance, who\r\n    are already working in France in industries mentioned above,\r\n    must be protected against being sent to work in Germany by the\r\n    Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor. The Fuehrer agreed\r\n    with the opinions of Reichsminister Speer and emphasized that\r\n    the measures taken by the Plenipotentiary for the Employment of\r\n    Labor should order no circumstances which would lead to the\r\n    withdrawal of workers from armament and auxiliary industries\r\n    working in occupied territories, because such a shift of workers\r\n    would only cause disturbance of production in occupied\r\n    countries.\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer further called attention to the fact that at least\r\n    250,000 laborers will be required for preparations against air\r\n    attacks in the field of civilian air raid protection. For Vienna\r\n    alone, 2,000-2,500 are required immediately. The Plenipotentiary\r\n    for the Employment of Labor must add at least 4 million workers\r\n    to the manpower pool, considering that he requires 2½ million\r\n    workers for maintenance of the present level, that Reich\r\n    Minister Speer needs 1.3 million additional workers, and that\r\n    the above-mentioned preparations for security measures against\r\n    air attacks call for 0.25 million laborers.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsfuehrer SS explained that the enforcement agents put\r\n    at his disposal are extremely few, but that he would try helping\r\n    the Sauckel project to succeed by increasing them and working\r\n    them harder. The Reichsfuehrer SS made immediately available\r\n    2,000 to 2,500 men from concentration camps for air raid\r\n    preparations in Vienna.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Results of the Conference_:\r\n\r\n    “(1) The Plenipotentiary for Employment of Labor shall procure\r\n    at least 4 million new workers from occupied territories.”\r\n    (_1292-PS_)\r\n\r\nMoreover, Sauckel, in requesting the assistance of the Army for the\r\nrecruitment of 1,000,000 men and women from the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories, informed Keitel that prompt action was required; and that,\r\nas in all other occupied countries, pressure had to be used if other\r\nmeasures were not successful (_3012-PS_). Finally, Sauckel was informed\r\nby Rosenberg that the enslavement of foreign labor was achieved by force\r\nand brutality (_018-PS_). Notwithstanding his knowledge of conditions,\r\nSauckel continued to request greater supplies of manpower from the areas\r\nin which the most ruthless methods had been applied. Indeed, when German\r\nField Commanders on the Eastern Front attempted to resist Sauckel’s\r\ndemands, because forced recruitment was swelling the ranks of the\r\npartisans and making the army’s task more difficult, Sauckel sent a\r\ntelegram to Hitler, dated 10 March 1943, in which he implored him to\r\nintervene:\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, my Fuehrer, I ask you to abolish all orders which\r\n    oppose the obligation of foreign workers for labor * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “If the obligation for labor and the forced recruiting of\r\n    workers in the East is not possible any more, then the German\r\n    war industry and agriculture cannot fulfill their tasks to the\r\n    full extent.” (_407-II-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to being responsible for the recruitment of foreign civilian\r\nlabor by force, Sauckel was responsible for the conditions under which\r\nforeign workers were deported to Germany and for the treatment to which\r\nthey were subjected within Germany. The conditions under which Sauckel’s\r\nslaves were transported to Germany, were known to Sauckel (_2241-PS_).\r\nMoreover, he accepted responsibility for these conditions. Regulation\r\nNumber 4 of 7 May 1942, issued by Sauckel as Plenipotentiary General for\r\nthe Mobilization of Labor, deals with recruitment, care, lodging,\r\nfeeding, and treatment of foreign workers of both sexes (_3044-PS_). By\r\nthis decree, Sauckel expressly directed that the assembly and operation\r\nof rail transports and the supplying of food therefor was the\r\nresponsibility of his agents until the transports arrived in Germany. By\r\nthe same regulation, Sauckel directed that within Germany the care of\r\nforeign industrial workers was to be carried out by the German Labor\r\nFront and that care of foreign agricultural workers was to be carried\r\nout by the Reich Food Administration. By the terms of the regulation,\r\nSauckel reserved for himself ultimate responsibility for all aspects of\r\ncare, treatment, lodging, and feeding of foreign workers while in\r\ntransit to and within Germany. The regulation reads (_3044-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The care of foreign labor will be carried out.\r\n\r\n    “_a._ up to the Reichs border\r\n    “by my commissioners or—in the occupied areas by the competent\r\n    military or civil labor mobilization agencies. Care of the labor\r\n    will be carried out in cooperation with the respective competent\r\n    foreign organization.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Within the area of the Reich\r\n    “1. By the German Labor Front in the cases of non-agricultural\r\n    workers.\r\n    “2. By the Reich Food administration in the case of agricultural\r\n    workers.\r\n    “The German Labor Front and the German Food Administration are\r\n    bound by my directives in the carrying out of their tasks of\r\n    caring for the workers.\r\n\r\n    “The agencies of the labor mobilization administration are to\r\n    give far-reaching support to the German Labor Front and the\r\n    German Food Administration in the fulfillment of their assigned\r\n    tasks.\r\n\r\n    “My competence for the execution of the care of foreign labor is\r\n    not prejudiced by the assignment of these tasks to the German\r\n    Labor Front and the Reichs Food Administration.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Composition and operation of the transports.\r\n\r\n    “The composition and operations of the transports up to the\r\n    place of work is the task of my representatives, in the occupied\r\n    territories of the labor mobilization agencies of the military\r\n    and civil administration. In the countries in which foreign\r\n    representatives are to direct the transports up to the frontier,\r\n    the German recruiting agency must take part in the supervision\r\n    and care of the transports.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Supply for the Transports.\r\n\r\n    “The food supply for the industrial workers in transit within\r\n    the Reich, is the duty of the (DAF) German workers front, office\r\n    for labor mobilization.\r\n\r\n    For the rest, my offices effect the supply for the transport.”\r\n    (_3044-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel, in an agreement with Ley, the head of the German Labor Front\r\n(DAF) dated 2 June 1943, again emphasized his ultimate responsibility by\r\ncreating a central inspectorate charged with examining the working and\r\nliving conditions of foreign workers, and reporting thereon to Sauckel’s\r\nagency (_1913-PS_). The agreement reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 2. The Reichsleiter of the German Labor Front,\r\n    Reichsorganisationleiter Dr. Ley, in collaboration with the\r\n    Plenipotentiary General for the _Arbeitseinsatz_, Gauleiter\r\n    Sauckel, will establish a ‘central inspection’ for the\r\n    continuous supervision of all measures concerning the care of\r\n    the foreign workers mentioned under 1. This will have the\r\n    designation:\r\n\r\n    ‘Central inspection for care of foreign workers.’\r\n\r\n    “The central inspection for the care of foreign workers\r\n    exercises its functions upon directives and in the name of the\r\n    Plenipotentiary General for the _Arbeitseinsatz_ and of the\r\n    Reichsleiter of the German Labor Front. In order to avoid all\r\n    duplication of work, it will be its sole responsibility, to\r\n    scrutinize all measures taken for the care of foreign workers\r\n    employed in the factories and camps, also to remove immediately\r\n    all defects discovered—as far as possible—on the spot and to\r\n    issue the necessary instructions for this.\r\n\r\n    “The authority of the Plenipotentiary General for the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_ to empower the members of his staff and the\r\n    presidents of the state employment offices to get direct\r\n    information on the conditions regarding the employment of\r\n    foreigners in the factories and camps, will remain untouched.\r\n\r\n    “3. The central inspection for the care of foreign workers will\r\n    be continuously in touch with the main office VI of the\r\n    Plenipotentiary General for the _Arbeitseinsatz_. It will\r\n    instruct the office on the general observations made and will\r\n    make suggestions for changes, if that should become necessary.\r\n\r\n    “4. The offices of the administration of the _Arbeitseinsatz_\r\n    will be constantly informed by the ‘central inspection for the\r\n    care of foreign workers’ of its observations, in particular\r\n    immediately in each case in which action of State organizations\r\n    seems to be necessary.” (_1913-PS_)\r\n\r\nSauckel was also responsible for compelling citizens of the occupied\r\ncountries against their will to manufacture implements of war for use in\r\noperations against their own country and its allies. These functions\r\nwere included in the terms of Sauckel’s appointment. (_1666-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a series of reports to Hitler, Sauckel described how successful he\r\nhad been in carrying out his program. One such report, dated 14 April\r\n1943, states that in a single year Sauckel had incorporated 1,622,829\r\nprisoners of war into the German economy:\r\n\r\n    “My Fuehrer,\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “1. After having been active as Plenipotentiary for\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_ for one year I have the honor to report to you\r\n    that 3,638,056 new foreign workers have been added to the German\r\n    war economy between April 1st. of the last year and March 31st\r\n    of this year.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Besides the foreign civilian workers another 1,622,829\r\n    prisoners of war are employed in the German economy.”\r\n    (_407-V-PS_)\r\n\r\nA subsequent report dated 3 June 1943, states that 846,511 additional\r\nforeign laborers and prisoners of war were incorporated into the German\r\nwar industry:\r\n\r\n    “My Fuehrer:\r\n\r\n    “1. I beg to be permitted to report to you on the situation of\r\n    the _Arbeitseinsatz_ for the first five months of 1943.

(_407-IX-PS_)\r\n\r\n        9. THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF INDIVIDUAL CONSPIRATORS\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following conspirators who were informed by Sauckel of\r\nthe quotas of foreign laborers which he required, collaborated with\r\nSauckel and his agents in filling these quotas:\r\n\r\nA. _Keitel, Chief of the OKW._\r\n\r\nThe record of a telephone conversation of the Chief of the Economic\r\nStaff East of the German Army, dated 11 March 1943, reads in part as\r\nfollows (_3012-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “The plenipotentiary for the _Arbeitseinsatz_, Gauleiter\r\n    Sauckel, points out to me in an urgent teletype, that the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_ in German agriculture as well as all the most\r\n    urgent armament programs, ordered by the Fuehrer, make the most\r\n    rapid procurement of approx. 1 million women and men from the\r\n    newly occupied territories an imperative necessity. For this\r\n    purpose, Gauleiter Sauckel demands the shipment of 5,000 workers\r\n    daily beginning 15 March, 10,000 workers male and female\r\n    beginning 1 April from the newly occupied territories.\r\n\r\n    “The daily quota of 5,000 (10,000) workers was distributed with\r\n    the consent of the GBA as follows:\r\n\r\n    Reich Commissioner Ukraine daily 3,000 (6,000) workers.\r\n\r\n    Wl Jn South daily 1,000 (2,000) workers.\r\n\r\n    Wl Jn Center daily 500 (1,000) workers.\r\n\r\n    Commissioner General White Ruthenia daily 500 (1,000) workers.\r\n\r\n    “In consideration of the extraordinary losses of workers, which\r\n    occurred in German war industry because of the developments of\r\n    the past months, it is now necessary, that the recruiting of\r\n    workers be taken up again everywhere with all emphasis. The\r\n    tendency momentarily noticeable in that territory, to limit\r\n    and/or entirely stop the Reich recruiting program is absolutely\r\n    not bearable in view of this state of affairs. Gauleiter\r\n    Sauckel, who is informed about these events, has because of\r\n    this, turned immediately to General Fieldmarshal Keitel on 10\r\n    March 1943, in a teletype, and has emphasized on this occasion,\r\n    that, as in all other occupied territories, there, where all\r\n    other methods fail, by order of the Fuehrer a certain pressure\r\n    must be used.” (_3012-PS_)\r\n\r\nConfirmation of Keitel’s collaboration with Sauckel is also found in the\r\ntranscript of an interrogation under oath of Sauckel held on the morning\r\nof 5 October 1945:\r\n\r\n    “Q. Was it necessary in order to accomplish the completion of\r\n    the quotas given to have liaison with the OKW?\r\n\r\n    “A. I remember that the Fuehrer had given directives to Marshal\r\n    Keitel, telling him that my task was a very important one, and\r\n    I, too, have often conferred with Keitel after such discussions\r\n    with the Fuehrer, when I asked him for his support.\r\n\r\n    “Q. It was his task to supervise the proper performance of the\r\n    military commanders in the occupied countries in carrying out\r\n    their missions, was it not?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes, the Fuehrer had told me that he would inform the Chief\r\n    of the OKW, and the Chief of the Reichs chancellery, as to these\r\n    missions. The same applies to the Foreign Minister.” (_3722-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Alfred Rosenberg, Reichs Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories._\r\n\r\nThe following colloquy is taken from the transcript of an interrogation\r\nunder oath of Alfred Rosenberg on the afternoon of 6 October 1945:\r\n\r\n    “Q. Isn’t it a fact, that Sauckel would allocate to the various\r\n    areas under your jurisdiction the number of persons to be\r\n    obtained for labor purposes?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Q. And that thereafter, your agents would obtain that labor, in\r\n    order to meet the quota which had been given; isn’t that right?\r\n\r\n    “A. Sauckel, normally, had very far-reaching desires, which one\r\n    couldn’t fulfill unless one looked very closely into the matter.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Never mind about Sauckel’s desires being far-reaching or not\r\n    being far-reaching. That has nothing to do with it. You were\r\n    given quotas for the areas over which you had jurisdiction, and\r\n    it was up to you to meet that quota?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes; it was the responsibility of the administrative\r\n    officials to receive this quota and to distribute the allotments\r\n    over the districts in such a way, according to number and\r\n    according to the age groups, so they would be most reasonably\r\n    met.\r\n\r\n    “Q. These administrative officials were part of your\r\n    organization, isn’t that right?\r\n\r\n    “A. They were functionaries or officials of the Reichskommissar\r\n    for the Ukraine, but, as such, they were placed in their office\r\n    by the Ministry for the Eastern Occupied Territories.”\r\n    (_3719-PS_)\r\n\r\nCorroboration is to be found in letters written by Sauckel to Rosenberg\r\nrequesting the latter’s assistance in the recruitment of additional\r\nforeign laborers. (_017-PS_; _019-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _Seyss-Inquart, Reichscommissar for the Occupied Netherlands._\r\n\r\nThe transcript of an interrogation under oath of Sauckel on the morning\r\nof 5 October 1945, reads in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Q. For a moment, I want to turn our attention to Holland. It is\r\n    my understanding that the quotas for the workers from Holland\r\n    were agreed upon, and then the numbers given to the\r\n    Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart to fulfill, is that correct?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes, that is correct.\r\n\r\n    “Q. After the quota was given to Seyss-Inquart, it was his\r\n    mission to fulfill it with the aid of your representatives; was\r\n    it not?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes. This was the only possible thing for me to do and the\r\n    same applied to other countries.” (_3722-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _Frank, Governor-General of the Government-General of Poland._\r\n\r\nThe transcript of interrogation under oath of Sauckel on the morning of\r\n5 October 1945 reveals the part played by Frank:\r\n\r\n    “Q. Was the same procedure substantially followed of allocating\r\n    quotas in the General Government Poland?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes. I have to basically state again that the only\r\n    possibility I had in carrying through these missions was to get\r\n    in touch with the highest German military authority in the\r\n    respective country and to transfer to them the orders of the\r\n    Fuehrer and ask them very urgently, as I have always done, to\r\n    fulfill these orders.\r\n\r\n    “Q. Such discussions in Poland, of course, were with the General\r\n    Governor Frank?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes. I spent a morning and afternoon in Krakov twice or\r\n    three times, and I personally spoke to General Governor Frank.\r\n    Naturally, there was also present Secretary Dr. Goebble.”\r\n    (_3722-PS_)\r\n\r\nE. _The SS, as in all matters involving the use of force and brutality,\r\nextended its assistance._\r\n\r\nThis is clearly indicated in Reichschancellor Lammers’ report of a\r\nconference with Hitler attended by, among others, Sauckel, Speer, and\r\nHimmler (the Reichsfuehrer SS). The conference proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Plenipotentiary for Employment of Labor, Sauckel, declared\r\n    that he will attempt with fanatical determination to obtain\r\n    these workers. Until now, he has always kept his promises as to\r\n    the number of workers to be furnished. With the best of\r\n    intentions, however, he is unable to make a definite promise for\r\n    1944. He will do everything in his powers to furnish the\r\n    requested manpower in 1944. Whether it will succeed depends\r\n    primarily on what _German_ enforcement agents will be made\r\n    available. His project cannot be carried out with domestic\r\n    enforcement agents. The Reichsfuehrer SS explained that the\r\n    enforcement agents put at his disposal are extremely few, but\r\n    that he would try helping the Sauckel project to succeed by\r\n    increasing them and working them harder.” (_1292-PS_)\r\n\r\n                10. THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF SPEER\r\n\r\nThe use of prisoners of war in the manufacture of arms and munitions,\r\nallocated thereto by Sauckel, was confirmed by Speer. Speer stated in an\r\ninterrogation under oath on 18 October 1945 that 40% of all prisoners of\r\nwar were employed in the production of weapons and munitions and in\r\nsubsidiary industries:\r\n\r\n    “* * * A. In the last phase of production, that is, in the year\r\n    1944 when everything collapsed, I had 40% of all prisoners of\r\n    war employed in the production. I wanted to have this percentage\r\n    increased.\r\n\r\n    “Q. And when you say employed in the production, you mean in\r\n    these subsidiary industries that you have discussed and also in\r\n    the production of weapons and munitions, is that right?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes. That is the total extent of my task.” (_3720-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the 36th Meeting of the Central Planning Board, of 22\r\nApril 1943, report Speer’s statement that:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 90,000 Russian prisoners of war employed in the whole of\r\n    the armament industry are for the greatest part skilled men.”\r\n    (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nSpeer actively participated in the planning and execution of the vast\r\nprogram of forcible deportation and enslavement of the citizens of the\r\noccupied countries. As Reich Minister of Armaments and Munitions and\r\nChief of the Organization Todt, both of which positions he acquired on\r\n15 February 1942, and by virtue of his later acquisition of control over\r\nthe armament offices of the Army, Navy and Airforce and the production\r\noffices of the Ministry of Economics, Speer was responsible for the\r\nentire war production of the Reich, as well as for the construction of\r\nfortifications and installations for the _Wehrmacht_. Proof of the\r\npositions held by Speer is supplied by his signed statement. (_2980-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe industries under Speer’s control were the most important users of\r\nmanpower in Germany. According to Sauckel, Speer’s labor requirements\r\nreceived unconditional priority over all other demands for labor. In an\r\ninterrogation under oath on 22nd September 1945, Sauckel stated:\r\n\r\n    “The others I only got whatever was left. Because Speer told me\r\n    once in the presence of the Fuehrer that I am here to work for\r\n    Speer and that mainly I am his man.” (_3721-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpeer has admitted under oath that he participated in the discussions\r\nduring which the decision to use foreign forced labor was made, that he\r\nconcurred in the decision, and that it was the basis for the program of\r\nbringing foreign workers into Germany by compulsion. The transcript of\r\nthe interrogation under oath of Speer, on 18 October 1945, contains the\r\nfollowing colloquy:\r\n\r\n    “Q. But is it clear to you Mr. Speer, that in 1942 when the\r\n    decisions were being taken concerning the use of forced foreign\r\n    labor that you participated in the discussions yourself?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Q. So that I take it that the execution of the program of\r\n    bringing foreign workers into Germany by compulsion under\r\n    Sauckel was based on earlier decisions that had been taken with\r\n    your agreement?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes, but I must point out that only a very small part of the\r\n    manpower that Sauckel brought into Germany was made available to\r\n    me; a far larger part of it was allocated to other departments\r\n    that demanded them.” (_3720-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis admission is confirmed by minutes of Speer’s conferences with\r\nHitler on 10, 11, and 12 August 1942 (_R-124_). In these meetings Speer\r\nrelated the outcome of negotiations concerning the forcible recruitment\r\nof a million Russian laborers for the German armaments industry, and\r\nstated that Hitler would agree to any necessary compulsion.\r\n\r\nThe use of force was again discussed by Hitler and Speer on 4 January\r\n1943. It was decided that stronger measures were to be used to\r\naccelerate the conscription of French civilian workers. (_556-13-PS_).\r\n\r\nSpeer demanded foreign workers for the industries under his control and\r\nused these workers with the knowledge that they had been deported by\r\nforce and were being compelled to work. Speer has stated under oath, in\r\nan interrogation on 18 October 1945 that:\r\n\r\n    “I do not wish to give the impression that I want to deny the\r\n    fact that I demanded manpower and foreign manpower from Sauckel\r\n    very energetically.” (_3720-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpeer also admitted, in the course of the same interrogation, that he\r\nknew he was obtaining foreign labor, a large part of which was forced\r\nlabor:\r\n\r\n    “Q. So that during the period when you were asking for labor, it\r\n    seems clear, does it not, that you knew that you were obtaining\r\n    foreign labor as well as domestic labor in response to your\r\n    requests and that a large part of the foreign labor was forced\r\n    labor.\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Q. So that, simply by way of illustration, suppose that on\r\n    January 1, 1944 you required 50,000 workers for a given purpose,\r\n    would you put in a requisition for 50,000 workers, knowing that\r\n    in that 50,000 there would be forced foreign workers?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.” (_3720-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpeer has furthermore stated under oath that he knew at least as early\r\nas September 1942 that workers from the Ukraine were being forcibly\r\ndeported for labor in Germany. He also knew that the great majority of\r\nthe workers of the Western occupied countries were slave laborers forced\r\nagainst their will to come to Germany. These facts are revealed in his\r\ninterrogation under oath on 18 October 1945:\r\n\r\n    “Q. When did you first find out then that some of the manpower\r\n    from the Ukraine was not coming voluntarily?\r\n\r\n    “A. It is rather difficult to answer this here, that is, to name\r\n    a certain date to you. However, it is certain that I knew that\r\n    at some particular point of time that the manpower from the\r\n    Ukraine did not come voluntarily.\r\n\r\n    “Q. And does that apply also to the manpower from other occupied\r\n    countries, that is, did there come a time when you knew that\r\n    they were not coming voluntarily?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Q. When, in general, would you say that time was, without\r\n    placing a particular month of the year?\r\n\r\n    “A. As far as the Ukraine situation goes, I believe that they\r\n    did not come voluntarily any more after a few months, because\r\n    immense mistakes were made in their treatment by us. I should\r\n    say offhand that this time was either in July, August or\r\n    September of 1942.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Q. But many workers did come from the West, did they not, to\r\n    Germany?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Q. That means then that the great majority of the workers that\r\n    came from the Western countries, the Western occupied countries,\r\n    came against their will to Germany.\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.” (_3720-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis admission is borne out by other evidence. In April 1943 Speer was\r\ninformed at a meeting of the Central Planning Board, that in all\r\ncountries conscription for work in Germany could be carried out only\r\nwith the active assistance of the police, and that the prevailing\r\nmethods of recruitment had provoked such violence that many German\r\nrecruiting agents had been killed (_R-124_). Again, at a meeting with\r\nHitler to discuss overall manpower requirements for 1944, Speer was\r\ninformed by Sauckel that labor requirements for the German war economy\r\n(including Speer’s requirements of 1,300,000 additional laborers) could\r\nbe met only if German enforcement agents were furnished to carry out the\r\nenslavement program in the occupied countries. (_1292-PS_)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his knowledge that foreign workers were being\r\nconscripted and deported for use as slave laborers in Germany, Speer\r\nformulated requirements for the foreign workers and requested their\r\nallocation to industries subject to his control. At another meeting of\r\nthe Central Planning Board, Speer stated:\r\n\r\n    “_Speer_: Now, the labor problem in Germany. I believe it is\r\n    still possible to transfer some from the western territories.\r\n    The Fuehrer stated only recently he wishes to dissolve these\r\n    foreign volunteers as he had the impression that the army groups\r\n    were carting around with them a lot of ballast. Therefore, if we\r\n    cannot settle this matter ourselves, we shall have to call a\r\n    meeting with the Fuehrer to clear up the coal situation. Keitel\r\n    and Zeitzler will be invited to attend in order to determine the\r\n    number of Russians from the rear army territories who can be\r\n    sent to us. However, I see another possibility; we might\r\n    organize another drive to screen out workers for the mines from\r\n    the Russian Ps/W in the Reich. But this possibility is none too\r\n    promising.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nAt another meeting of the Central Planning Board, Speer rejected a\r\nsuggestion that labor for industries under his control be furnished from\r\nGerman sources instead of from foreign countries, for these reasons:\r\n\r\n    “_Speer_: We do it that way: Kehrl collects the demands for\r\n    labor necessary to complete the coal-and-iron-plan and\r\n    communicates the numbers to Sauckel. Probably there will be a\r\n    conference at the Reich Marshal’s in the next week, and an\r\n    answer from Sauckel should have arrived by then. The question of\r\n    recruitment for the armaments industry will be solved together\r\n    with Weger.\r\n\r\n    “_Kehrl_: I wish to urge that the allotments to the mines should\r\n    not be made dependent on the recruitment of men abroad. We were\r\n    completely frustrated these last three months because this\r\n    principle had been applied. We ended December with a deficit of\r\n    25,000 and we never get replacements. The number must be made up\r\n    by men from Germany.\r\n\r\n    “_Speer_: No, nothing doing!” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nSpeer also advocated terror and brutality as a means of maximizing\r\nproduction by slave laborers who worked in the industries under his\r\ncontrol. In the course of a discussion concerning the supply and\r\nexploitation of labor, Speer stated:\r\n\r\n    “_Speer_: We must also discuss the slackers. Ley has ascertained\r\n    that the sick list decreased to one-fourth or one-fifth in\r\n    factories where doctors are on the staff who are examining the\r\n    sick men. There is nothing to be said against SS and Police\r\n    taking drastic steps and putting those known as slackers into\r\n    concentration camps. There is no alternative. Let it happen\r\n    several times and the news will soon go round.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nSpeer is also guilty of compelling Allied nationals and prisoners of war\r\nto engage not only in the production of armaments and munitions, but\r\nalso in direct military operations, against their own country and its\r\nactively resisting allies. Speer, as Chief of the Organization Todt, is\r\naccountable for its policies which were in direct conflict with the laws\r\nof war. The Organization Todt, in violation of the laws of war,\r\nimpressed allied nationals into its service. Proof of its activity is\r\nfurnished by an International Labor Office Study of Exploitation of\r\nForeign Labor by Germany:\r\n\r\n    “The methods used for the recruitment of foreign workers who\r\n    were destined for employment in the Organization did not greatly\r\n    differ from the methods used for the recruitment of foreigners\r\n    for deportation to Germany. The main difference was that, since\r\n    the principal activities of the Organization lay outside the\r\n    frontiers of Germany, foreigners were not transported to\r\n    Germany, but had either to work in their own country or in some\r\n    other occupied territory.\r\n\r\n    “In the recruitment drives for foreign workers for the\r\n    Organization methods of compulsion as well as methods of\r\n    persuasion were used, the latter usually with very little result\r\n    * * *.” (_L-191_)\r\n\r\nSimilar violations of the laws of warfare are disclosed in\r\n(_407-VIII-PS_).\r\n\r\nAs Chief of German war production, Speer sponsored and approved the use\r\nof prisoners of war in the production of armaments and munitions which\r\nwere used against their own country and its actively resisting allies.\r\nThis fact has been demonstrated by the evidence already discussed. To\r\nrecapitulate:\r\n\r\n1. After Speer assumed responsibility for armament production, his\r\nprimary concern in his discussions with his co-conspirators was to\r\nsecure a larger allocation of prisoners of war for his armament\r\nfactories. In a meeting of the Central Planning Board on 22 April 1943,\r\nSpeer complained that only 30% of the Russian prisoners of war were\r\nengaged in the armament industry. (_R-124_)\r\n\r\n2. In an earlier speech, Speer stated that 10,000 prisoners of war were\r\nput at the disposal of the armaments industry upon his orders.\r\n(_1435-PS_)\r\n\r\n3. Finally, Speer advocated returning escaped prisoners of war to\r\nfactories as convicts. He said, at a meeting of the Central Planning\r\nBoard:\r\n\r\n    “We have to come to an arrangement with the Reichsfuehrer SS as\r\n    soon as possible so that prisoners of war he picks up are made\r\n    available for our purposes. The Reichsfuehrer SS gets from 30 to\r\n    40,000 men per month. First of all they have to be divided up.\r\n    From what classes do these people come, anyhow? There certainly\r\n    is a certain percentage of miners among these people who are\r\n    picked up. These few thousand men have to go to the mines\r\n    automatically. Certainly, some educational work has to be done.\r\n    The men should be put into the factories as convicts. But they\r\n    have to return to the factories where they were before * * *.”\r\n    (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nSpeer is also guilty of having approved and sponsored the program for\r\nusing concentration camp labor in Nazi armament factories, which was\r\npart of the larger program of extermination through work. The proof of\r\nthis activity may be summarized and supplemented as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Speer proposed measures for the exploitation of the concentration\r\ncamp labor in armament factories under his jurisdiction. At a meeting\r\nwith Hitler Speer proposed and Hitler agreed that armament production\r\nshould not be established within concentration camps but that\r\nconcentration camp labor should be made available to established\r\narmament factories. (_R-124_)\r\n\r\n2. Speer, by arranging for the use of concentration camp laborers in\r\nfactories under his control, created an increasing demand for such\r\nlabor. This demand was filled in part by placing in concentration camps\r\npersons who would not ordinarily have been sent there. (_1063-D-PS_)\r\n\r\n3. Speer participated in the exploitation of the victims of the Nazi\r\nprogram of extermination through work. He personally selected sites for\r\nsubsidiary concentration camps which were established near factories in\r\nUpper Austria, and knew and approved of the general practice of locating\r\nconcentration camps near industrial plants which they supplied with\r\nlabor (Speer’s interrogation under oath on 18 October 1945. (_3720-PS_)\r\n\r\nSpeer visited the concentration camp Mauthaussen and factories such as\r\nthose of Krupp, where concentration camp labor was exploited under\r\nbarbarous conditions. Despite personal and first-hand knowledge of these\r\nconditions, Speer continued to direct the use of concentration camp\r\nlabor in factories under his jurisdiction. In Speer’s interrogation\r\nunder oath on 18 October 1945, he stated:\r\n\r\n    “Q. But, in general, the use of concentration camp labor was\r\n    known to you and approved by you as a source of labor?\r\n\r\n    “A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Q. And you knew also, I take it, that among the inmates of the\r\n    concentration camps there were both Germans and foreigners?\r\n\r\n    “A. I didn’t think about it at that time.\r\n\r\n    “Q. As a matter of fact you visited the Austrian concentration\r\n    camp personally, did you not?”\r\n\r\n    “A. I didn’t—well I was in Mauthaussen once but at that time I\r\n    was not told just to what categories the inmates of the\r\n    concentration camps belonged.\r\n\r\n    “Q. But in general everybody knew, did they not, that foreigners\r\n    who were taken away by the Gestapo, or arrested by the Gestapo,\r\n    as well as Germans, found their way into the concentration\r\n    camps?\r\n\r\n    “A. Of course, yes. I didn’t mean to imply anything like that.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Q.

It was a primary weapon in the battle against\r\nthe Jews, against the Christian church, against labor, against those who\r\nwanted peace, against opposition or non-conformity of any kind. It\r\ninvolved the systematic use of terror to achieve the cohesion within\r\nGermany which was necessary for the execution of the conspirators’ plans\r\nfor aggression. It was the final link in a chain of terror and\r\nrepression which involved the SS and the Gestapo and which resulted in\r\nthe apprehension of victims and their confinement without trial, often\r\nwithout charges, generally with no indication of the length of their\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\nThe SS through its espionage system tracked down the victims; the\r\ncriminal police and the Gestapo seized them and brought them to the\r\nconcentration camps; and the concentration camps were administered by\r\nthe SS. No attempt will be made to present a complete catalogue of\r\nindividual brutalities. The emphasis will rather be upon the fundamental\r\npurposes for which these camps were used, the techniques of terror which\r\nwere employed, the large number of their victims, and the death and\r\nanguish which they caused.\r\n\r\n                1. THE BEGINNING OF “PROTECTIVE CUSTODY”\r\n\r\nThe Nazis realized early that without the most drastic repression of\r\nactual and potential opposition they could not consolidate their power\r\nover the German people. Immediately after Hitler became Chancellor, the\r\nconspirators promptly destroyed civil liberties by issuing the\r\nPresidential Emergency Decree of 28 February 1933 (_1390-PS_). It was\r\nthis decree which was the basis for “_Schutzhaft_”, that is, “protective\r\ncustody”—the power of the Gestapo to imprison people without judicial\r\nproceedings. This is made clear by a typical order for protective\r\ncustody:\r\n\r\n    “_Order of Protective Custody._ Based on Article 1 of the Decree\r\n    of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State of\r\n    28 February 1933 (_Reichsgesetzblatt_ I, p. 83), you are taken\r\n    into protective custody in the interest of public security and\r\n    order.\r\n\r\n    “Reason: Suspicion of activities inimical toward the State.”\r\n    (_2499-PS_)\r\n\r\nGoering, in a book entitled “_Aufbau Einer Nation_” and published in\r\n1934, sought to give the impression that the camps originally were\r\ndirected at those whom the Nazis considered “Communists” and “Social\r\nDemocrats”. At page 89 of this book he stated:\r\n\r\n    “We had to deal ruthlessly with these enemies of the State. It\r\n    must not be forgotten that at the moment of our seizure of power\r\n    over 6 million people officially voted for Communism and about 8\r\n    million for Marxism in the Reichstag elections in March.\r\n\r\n    “Thus the concentration camps were created, to which we had to\r\n    send first thousands of functionaries of the Communist and\r\n    Social Democratic parties.” (_2324-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn practical operations, the power to order confinement was almost\r\nwithout limit: Frick, in an order which he issued on 25 January 1938, as\r\nMinister of Interior, made this clear. Article 1 of this order provided:\r\n\r\n    “Protective custody can be decreed as a coercive measure of the\r\n    Secret State Police against persons who endanger the security of\r\n    the people and the State through their attitude in order to\r\n    counter all aspirations of enemies of the people and State.”\r\n    (_1723-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis order further provides:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In a summary of all the previously issued decrees on the\r\n    cooperation between the Party and the Gestapo I refer to the\r\n    following and ordain:\r\n\r\n    “1. To the Gestapo has been entrusted the mission by the Fuehrer\r\n    to watch over and to eliminate all enemies of the Party and the\r\n    National Socialist State as well as all disintegrating forces of\r\n    all kinds directed against both. The successful solution of this\r\n    mission forms one of the most essential prerequisite for the\r\n    unhampered and frictionless work of the Party. The Gestapo, in\r\n    their extremely difficult task, is to be granted support and\r\n    assistance in every possible way by the NSDAP.” (_1723-PS_)\r\n\r\nA. _Persecution of Pacifists._\r\n\r\nThe conspirators, then, were directing their apparatus of terror against\r\nthe “enemies of the State”, against “disintegrating forces”, and against\r\nthose people who endangered the State “with their attitudes”. Whom did\r\nthey consider as belonging in these broad categories? First, they were\r\nthe men in Germany who wanted peace. In this connection an affidavit by\r\nGerhart H. Segar declares as follows:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 2. During the period after World War I up until my\r\n    commitment to the Leipzig jail and Oranienburg concentration\r\n    camp in the spring of 1933 following the Nazis’ accession to\r\n    power in January of that year, my business and political\r\n    affiliations exposed me to the full impact of the Nazi theories\r\n    and practice of violent regimentation and terroristic tactics.\r\n    My conflict with the Nazis by virtue of my identification with\r\n    the peace movement, and as duly elected member of the Reichstag\r\n    representing a political faith (Social Democratic Party) hostile\r\n    to National Socialism, clearly demonstrated that, even in the\r\n    period prior to 1933, the Nazis considered crimes and terrorism\r\n    a necessary and desirable weapon in overcoming democratic\r\n    opposition * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * (e). That the Nazis had already conceived the device of\r\n    the concentration camp as a means of suppressing and regimenting\r\n    opposition elements was forcefully brought to my attention\r\n    during the course of a conversation which I had with Dr. Wilhelm\r\n    Frick in December 1932. Frick at that time was Chairman of the\r\n    Foreign Affairs Committee of the Reichstag of which I was a\r\n    member. When I gave an emphatic answer to Frick concerning the\r\n    particular matter discussed, he replied, ‘Don’t worry, when we\r\n    are in power we shall put all of you guys into concentration\r\n    camps.’ When the Nazis came into power, Frick was appointed\r\n    Reichminister of Interior and promptly carried out his threat in\r\n    collaboration with Goering, as Chief of the Prussian State\r\n    Police, and Himmler.” (_L-83_)\r\n\r\nThus, even before the Nazis had seized power in Germany they had\r\nconceived of the plan to repress any potential opposition by terror.\r\n\r\nFrick’s statement to Gerhart Segar is completely consistent with an\r\nearlier statement which he made on 18 October 1929. Frick at that time\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n    “This fateful struggle will first be taken up with the ballot,\r\n    but this cannot continue indefinitely, for history has taught us\r\n    that in a battle, blood must be shed, and iron broken. The\r\n    ballot is the beginning of this fateful struggle. We are\r\n    determined to promulgate by force that which we preach. Just as\r\n    Mussolini exterminated the Marxists in Italy, so must we also\r\n    succeed in accomplishing the same through dictatorship and\r\n    terror.” (_2513-PS_)\r\n\r\nThere are many additional cases of the use of the concentration camp\r\nagainst the men who wanted peace. There was, for example, a group called\r\nthe “_Bibel Forscher_” (Bible Research Workers), most of whom were\r\nJehovah’s Witnesses. Since they were pacifists, the conspirators\r\nprovided not only for their prosecution in the regular courts, but also\r\nfor confining them in concentration camps after they had served the\r\njudicial sentences. An order by the Secret State Police, Berlin, dated 5\r\nAugust 1937, provided:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsminister of Justice had informed me that he does not\r\n    share the opinion voiced by subordinate departments on various\r\n    occasions, according to which, the arrest of the\r\n    _Bibelforschers_ after they have served a sentence, is supposed\r\n    to jeopardize the authority of the law courts. He is fully aware\r\n    of the necessity for measures by the State Police after the\r\n    sentence has been served. He asks, however, not to bring the\r\n    _Bibelforschers_ into protective custody under circumstances\r\n    detrimental to the respect of the law courts * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “2. If information regarding the impending release of a\r\n    _Bibelforscher_ from arrest is received from the authorities\r\n    carrying out the sentence, my decision regarding the ordering of\r\n    measures by the State Police, will be asked for in accordance\r\n    with my circular decree dated 22.4.37, so that transfer to a\r\n    concentration camp can take place immediately after the sentence\r\n    has been served. Should a transfer into a concentration camp\r\n    immediately after the serving of the sentence not be possible,\r\n    _Bibelforschers_ will be detained in police prisons.” (_D-84_)\r\n\r\nB. _Persecution of Trade Union Members._\r\n\r\nLabor unions, traditionally opposed to wars of aggression, also felt the\r\nfull force of Nazi terror. The concentration camp was an important\r\nweapon in the campaign against the trade unions. Goering made it plain,\r\nfor instance, that members of the Social Democratic Party were to be\r\nconfined in concentration camps (_2324-PS_). Labor leaders were largely\r\nmembers of that party and soon learned the meaning of “protective\r\ncustody”.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, an order that one Joseph Simon should be placed in\r\nprotective custody, is pertinent (_2330-PS_). The “reasons” given were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “Simon was for many years a member of the Socialist Party and\r\n    temporarily a member of the Union Socialiste Populaire. From\r\n    1907 to 1918 he was _Landtag_ deputy of the Socialist Party;\r\n    from 1908 to 1930 Social Democratic City Counsellor (_Stadtrat_)\r\n    in Nurnberg. In view of the decisive role which Simon played in\r\n    the international trade unions and in regard to his connection\r\n    with international Marxist leaders and central agencies, which\r\n    he continued after the national recovery, he was placed under\r\n    protective custody on 3 May 1933, and was kept, until 25 January\r\n    1934, in the Dachau concentration camp. Simon is under the\r\n    urgent suspicion that even after this date he played an active\r\n    part in the illegal continuation of the Socialist Party. He took\r\n    part in meetings which aimed at the illegal continuation of the\r\n    Socialist Party and propagation of illegal Marxist printed\r\n    matter in Germany.\r\n\r\n    “Through this radical attitude which is hostile to the State,\r\n    Simon directly endangers public security and order.” (_2330-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther instances of this persecution of members of trade unions are\r\ncontained in (_2334-PS_) and (_2928-PS_).\r\n\r\nC. _Persecution of Jews._\r\n\r\nThousands of Jews, were, of course, confined in concentration camps.\r\n(For a fuller discussion of this point see Chapter XII.) Among the\r\nwealth of evidence showing the confinement of Germans only because they\r\nwere Jews, a teletype from SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich is typical. This\r\norder is dated 10 November 1938, and is addressed to all headquarters of\r\nthe State Police and all districts and sub-districts of the SD\r\n(_3051-PS_). Paragraph 5 of this teletype, which was entitled “Measures\r\nagainst Jews tonight,” provided:\r\n\r\n    “* * * 5. Inasmuch as in the course of the events of this night\r\n    the employment of officials used for this purpose would be\r\n    possible, in all districts as many Jews, especially rich ones,\r\n    are to be arrested as can be accommodated in the existing\r\n    prisons. For the time being only healthy men not too old are to\r\n    be arrested. Upon their arrest, the appropriate concentration\r\n    camps should be contacted immediately, in order to confine them\r\n    in these camps as fast as possible.” (_3051-PS_)\r\n\r\nHimmler in 1943 indicated that use of the concentration camp against the\r\nJews had been motivated, not simply by Nazi racialism, but also by a\r\nfear that the Jews might have been an obstacle to aggression. In a\r\nspeech delivered at a meeting of the SS Major Generals at Posen on 4\r\nOctober 1943, Himmler sought to justify the Nazi anti-Jewish policy:\r\n\r\n    “I mean the clearing out of the Jews, the extermination of the\r\n    Jewish race. It’s one of those things it is easy to talk\r\n    about—‘The Jewish race is being exterminated’, says one party\r\n    member, ‘that’s quite clear, it’s in our program, elimination of\r\n    the Jews, and we’re doing it, exterminating them’. And then they\r\n    come, 80 million worthy Germans, and each one has his decent\r\n    Jew. Of course, the others are vermin, but this one is an A-1\r\n    Jew. Not one of all those who talk this way has witnessed it,\r\n    not one of them has been through it. Most of you must know what\r\n    it means when 100 corpses are lying side by side, or 500 or\r\n    1,000. To have stuck it out and at the same time—apart from\r\n    exceptions caused by human weakness—to have remained decent\r\n    fellows, that is what has made us hard. This is a page of glory\r\n    in our history which has never been written and is never to be\r\n    written, for we know how difficult we should have made it for\r\n    ourselves, if—with the bombing raids, the burden and\r\n    deprivations of war—we still had Jews today in every town as\r\n    secret saboteurs, agitators and trouble-mongers.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the foregoing evidence that prior to the launching of a\r\nNazi aggression, the concentration camp had been one of the principal\r\nweapons by which the conspirators achieved the social cohesion which was\r\nneeded for the execution of their plans for aggression. After the\r\nconspirators launched their aggression and their armies swept over\r\nEurope, they brought the concentration camp and the whole system of Nazi\r\nterror to occupied countries. In addition, they brought the citizens of\r\nthe occupied countries to Germany and subjected them to the whole\r\napparatus of Nazi brutality. In a communication to Himmler dated 16\r\nDecember 1942, Mueller, for the Chief of the Security Police and SD,\r\ndeals with the seizure of Polish Jews for deportation to concentration\r\ncamps in Germany. I should like to quote the body of this communication:\r\n\r\n    “In connection with the increase in the transfer of labor to the\r\n    _concentration camps_, ordered to be completed by 30 January\r\n    1943, the following procedure may be applied in the Jewish\r\n    section.\r\n\r\n    “1. Total number: 45,000 Jews.\r\n\r\n    “2. Start of transportation: 11 January 1943; End of\r\n    transportation: 31 January 1943. (The Reich railroads are unable\r\n    to provide special trains for the evacuation during the period\r\n    from 15 December 1942 to 10 January 1943 because of the\r\n    increased traffic of armed forces leave trains).\r\n\r\n    “3. Composition: The 45,000 Jews are to consist of 30,000 Jews\r\n    from the district of _Byalystock_. 10,000 Jews from the Ghetto\r\n    _Theresienstadt_, 5,000 of whom are Jews fit for work who\r\n    heretofore had been used for smaller jobs required for the\r\n    Ghetto, and 5,000 Jews who are generally incapable of working,\r\n    also over 60 year old Jews * * *. As heretofore only such Jews\r\n    would be taken for the evacuation who do not have any particular\r\n    connections and who are not in possession of any high\r\n    decorations. 3,000 Jews from the occupied Dutch territories,\r\n    2,000 Jews from Berlin—45,000. The figure of 45,000 includes\r\n    the invalid (old Jews and children). _By use of a practical\r\n    standard_, the screening of the arriving Jews in Auschwitz\r\n    should yield at least 10,000 to 15,000 people fit for work.”\r\n    (_R-91_)\r\n\r\nThe Jews of Hungary suffered the same fate. Between 19 March 1944 and 1\r\nAugust 1944 more than 400,000 Hungarian Jews were rounded up. Many of\r\nthese were put in wagons and sent to extermination camps. An affidavit\r\nmade in London by Dr. Rudolph Kastner, a former official of the\r\nHungarian Zionist Organization, states in part:\r\n\r\n    “19 March 1944: Together with the German military occupation\r\n    arrived in Budapest a ‘Special Section Commando’ of the German\r\n    Secret Police with the sole object of liquidating the Hungarian\r\n    Jews * * * They arrested and later deported to Mauthausen, all\r\n    the leaders of Jewish political and business life and\r\n    journalists, together with the Hungarian democratic and\r\n    anti-Fascist politicians * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Up to 27 June 1944, 475,000 Jews were deported.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “According to statements of Krumey and Wislicseny in February or\r\n    March 1945 a conference of the officers of IV.B. was called to\r\n    Berlin by Eichmann in the spring of 1942. He then informed them\r\n    that the government decided in favor of the complete\r\n    annihilation of the European Jews and that this will be carried\r\n    out silently in the gas-chambers. ‘Victory is ours,’ declared\r\n    Eichmann. ‘The end of the war is near. We must hurry as this is\r\n    the last chance to free Europe of the Jews. After the war it\r\n    will not be possible to utilize such methods.’”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Commanders of the death-camps gassed only on direct or indirect\r\n    instructions of Eichmann. The particular officer of IV.B. who\r\n    directed the deportations from some particular country had the\r\n    authority to indicate whether the train should go to a death\r\n    camp or not, and what should happen to the passengers. The\r\n    instructions were usually carried by the SS-NCO escorting the\r\n    train. The letters ‘A’ or ‘M’ on the escorting instruction\r\n    documents indicated Auschwitz or Majdanek; it meant that the\r\n    passengers were to be gassed. * * * Regarding Hungarian Jews the\r\n    following general ruling was laid down in Auschwitz: children up\r\n    to the age of 12 or 14, older people above 50, as well as the\r\n    sick, or people with criminal records (who were transported in\r\n    specially marked wagons) were taken immediately on their arrival\r\n    to the gas chambers.\r\n\r\n    “The others passed before an SS doctor who, on sight indicated\r\n    who was fit for work, and who was not. Those unfit were sent to\r\n    the gas chambers, while the others were distributed in various\r\n    labor camps.” (_2605-PS_)\r\n\r\n            2. “CHARGES” AGAINST CONCENTRATION CAMP INMATES\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern territories, these victims were apprehended for\r\nextermination in concentration camps without any charges having been\r\nmade against them. In the Western occupied territories, charges were\r\napparently made against some of the victims. Some of the charges which\r\nthe Nazis considered sufficient basis for confinement in a concentration\r\ncamp are illustrated in a summary of the file of the dossier of 25\r\npersons arrested in Luxembourg for commitment to various concentration\r\ncamps and sets forth the charges made against each person (_L-215_).\r\nThese charges read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Name                       Charge                       Place of\r\n                                                            Confinement\r\n\r\n HENRICY—     By associating with members of illegal      Natzweiler\r\n                resistance movements and making money for\r\n                them violating legal foreign exchange\r\n                rates, by harming the interests of the\r\n                Reich and being expected in the future to\r\n                disobey official administrative\r\n                regulations and act as an enemy of the\r\n                Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\n KRIER—       By being responsible for advanced sabotage  Buchenwald\r\n                of labor and causing fear because of his\r\n                political and criminal past.

USE OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR PRISONERS OF WAR\r\n\r\nNot only civilians of the occupied territories, but also prisoners of\r\nwar were subjected to the concentration camp. A memorandum to all\r\nofficers of the State Police, signed by Mueller, Chief of the Gestapo,\r\ndated 9 November 1941, discusses the “Transportation of Russian\r\nPrisoners of War, Destined for Execution, into the Concentration Camps.”\r\n(_1165-PS_). This memorandum states in part:\r\n\r\n    “The commandants of the concentration camps are complaining that\r\n    5 to 10% of the Soviet Russians destined for execution are\r\n    arriving in the camps dead or half dead. Therefore the\r\n    impression has arisen that the Stalags are getting rid of such\r\n    prisoners in this way.\r\n\r\n    “It was particularly noted that, when marching, for example,\r\n    from the railroad station to the camp, a rather large number of\r\n    PWs collapsed on the way from exhaustion, either dead or half\r\n    dead, and had to be picked up by a truck following the convoy.\r\n\r\n    “It cannot be prevented that the German people take notice of\r\n    these occurrences.\r\n\r\n    “Even if the transportation to the camps is generally taken care\r\n    of by the Wehrmacht, the population will attribute this\r\n    situation to the SS.\r\n\r\n    “In order to prevent, if possible, similar occurrences in the\r\n    future, I therefore order that, effective from today on, Soviet\r\n    Russians, declared definitely suspect and obviously marked by\r\n    death (for example with typhus) and who therefore would not be\r\n    able to withstand the exertions of even a short march on foot,\r\n    shall in the future, as a matter of basic principle, be excluded\r\n    from the transport into the concentration camps for execution.”\r\n    (_1165-PS_)\r\n\r\nAdditional evidence of the confinement of Russian prisoners of war in\r\nconcentration camps is found in an official report of the investigation\r\nof the Flossenburg concentration camp by Headquarters Third United\r\nStates Army, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Branch, dated 21 June\r\n1945 (_2309-PS_). This report states:\r\n\r\n    “In 1941 an additional stockade was added at the Flossenburg\r\n    Camp, to hold 2,000 Russian prisoners. From these 2,000\r\n    prisoners only 102 survived.” (_2309-PS_)\r\n\r\nSoviet prisoners of war found their allies in the concentration camps.\r\nThe same official report continues:\r\n\r\n    “The victims of Flossenburg included among the Russian,\r\n    civilians and prisoners of war, German nationals, Italians,\r\n    Belgians, Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, British and American\r\n    prisoners of war. No practical means was available to complete a\r\n    list of victims of this camp, however, since the foundation of\r\n    the camp in 1938 until the day of liberation it is estimated\r\n    that more than 29,000 inmates died.” (_2309-PS_)\r\n\r\nEscaped prisoners of war were sent to concentration camps, which were\r\nspecially set up as extermination centers. A communication from the\r\nSecret State Police Office, Cologne, dated 4 March 1944, transmitted the\r\nfollowing orders of the OKW—for which Keitel is responsible—concerning\r\nescaped prisoners of war:\r\n\r\n    “1. Every captured escaped prisoner of war who is an officer or\r\n    a non-working non-commissioned officer, except British and\r\n    American prisoners of war, is to be turned over to the Chief of\r\n    the Security Police and of the Security Service under the\r\n    classification ‘Step III’ regardless of whether the escape\r\n    occurred during a transport, whether it was a mass escape or an\r\n    individual one.\r\n\r\n    “2. Since the transfer of the prisoners of war to the Security\r\n    Police and Security Service may not become officially known to\r\n    the outside under any circumstances other prisoners of war may\r\n    by no means be informed of the capture. The captured prisoners\r\n    are to be reported to the Army Information Bureau as ‘escaped\r\n    and not captured’. Their mail is to be handled accordingly.\r\n    Inquiries of representatives of the Protective Power of the\r\n    International Red Cross, and of other aid societies will be\r\n    given the same answer.” (_1650-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe same communication carried a copy of an order of SS General Mueller,\r\nacting for the Chief of the Security Police and SD, which directed the\r\nGestapo to transport escaped prisoners directly to Mauthausen. The first\r\ntwo paragraphs of Mueller’s order provide:\r\n\r\n    “The State Police Directorates will accept the captured escaped\r\n    officer prisoners of war from the prisoner of war camp\r\n    commandants and will transport them to the Concentration Camp\r\n    Mauthausen following the procedure previously used, unless the\r\n    circumstances render a special transport imperative. The\r\n    prisoners of war are to be put in irons on the transport—not on\r\n    the station if it is subject to view by the public. The camp\r\n    commandant at Mauthausen is to be notified that the transfer\r\n    occurs within the scope of the action ‘Kugel’. The State Police\r\n    Directorates will submit semi-yearly reports on these transfers\r\n    giving merely the figures, the first report being due on 5 July\r\n    1944 (sharp). * * * For the sake of secrecy, the Supreme Command\r\n    of the Armed Forces has been requested to inform the prisoner of\r\n    war camps to turn the captured prisoners over to the local State\r\n    Police Office and not to send them directly to Mauthausen.”\r\n    (_1650-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is no coincidence that the literal translation for the German word\r\n“_Kugel_” is “bullet”, since Mauthausen, where the escaped prisoners\r\nwere sent, was an extermination center.\r\n\r\n                 4. THE NETWORK OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS\r\n\r\nNazi conquest was marked by the establishment of concentration camps\r\nover all of Europe. The following report on the location of\r\nconcentration camps, signed by Pohl, an SS General who was in charge of\r\nconcentration camp labor policies, indicates the scope of these\r\nactivities:\r\n\r\n    “1. At the outbreak of war there existed the following\r\n    concentration camps:\r\n\r\n    a Dachau, 1939, 4,000 prisoners, today 8,000.\r\n\r\n    b Sachsenhausen, 1939, 6,500 prisoners, today 10,000.\r\n\r\n    c Buchenwald, 1939, 5,300 prisoners, today 9,000.\r\n\r\n    d Mauthausen, 1939, 1,500 prisoners, today 5,500.\r\n\r\n    e Flossenburg, 1939, 1,600 prisoners, today 4,700.\r\n\r\n    f Ravensbrueck, 1939, 2,500 prisoners, today 7,500.\r\n\r\n    “2. In the years 1940 to 1942 nine further camps were erected,\r\n    viz.:\r\n\r\n    a. Auschwitz (Poland)\r\n\r\n    b. Neuengamme\r\n\r\n    c. Gusen (Austria)\r\n\r\n    d. Natzweiler (France)\r\n\r\n    e. Gross-Rosen\r\n\r\n    f. Lublin (Poland)\r\n\r\n    g. Niederhagen\r\n\r\n    h. Stutthof (near Danzig)\r\n\r\n    i. Arbeitsdorf.” (_R-129_)\r\n\r\nIn addition to these camps in occupied territory, there were many\r\nothers. The official report by the Headquarters, Third U. S. Army, Judge\r\nAdvocate Section, War Crimes Branch, contains the following evidence:\r\n\r\n    “Concentration Camp Flossenburg was founded in 1938 as a camp\r\n    for political prisoners. Construction was commenced on the camp\r\n    in 1938 and it was not until April 1940 that the first transport\r\n    of prisoners was received. From this time on prisoners began to\r\n    flow steadily into the camp. * * * Flossenburg was the mother\r\n    camp and under its direct control and jurisdiction were 47\r\n    satellite camps or outer-commandos for male prisoners and 27\r\n    camps for female workers. To these outer-commandos were supplied\r\n    the necessary prisoners for the various work projects\r\n    undertaken.\r\n\r\n    “Of all these outer-commandos Hersbruck and Leitmeritz (in\r\n    Czechoslovakia), Oberstaubling, Mulsen and Sall, located on the\r\n    Danube, were considered to be the worst.” (_2309-PS_)\r\n\r\n          5. THE CONCENTRATION CAMP AS AN INSTRUMENT OF TERROR\r\n\r\nThe savage treatment which was inflicted in these concentration camps\r\nupon allied nationals, prisoners of war, and other victims of Nazi\r\nterror has been depicted in motion picture evidence. Verbal discussion\r\nof this subject may therefore be brief.\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the Central Planning Committee, on which Speer sat, and\r\nwhere the high strategy of Nazi armament production was formulated,\r\nrecord a conference on the question of squeezing more work out of slave\r\nlaborers. Speer, who was not generally considered a fanatic like Frick,\r\nor a man of Blood and Iron like Goering, handled the problem in this\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n    “Speer: We must also discuss the slackers. Ley has ascertained\r\n    that the sick list decreased to one-fourth or one-fifth in\r\n    factories where doctors are on the staff who are examining the\r\n    sick men. There is nothing to be said against SS and Police\r\n    taking drastic steps and putting those known as slackers into\r\n    concentration camps. There is no alternative. Let it happen\r\n    several times and the news will soon go around.” (_R-124_)\r\n\r\nThe deterrent effect of the concentration camps upon the public was\r\ncarefully planned. To heighten the atmosphere of terror surrounding the\r\nconcentration camps, they were shrouded in secrecy. What went on behind\r\nthe barbed wire enclosures was a matter of fearful conjecture in Germany\r\nand the countries under Nazi control.\r\n\r\nThis was the policy from the very beginning, when the Nazis first came\r\ninto power in Germany and set up their concentration camp system. An\r\norder issued in 1 October 1933 by the Camp Commander of Dachau\r\nprescribes a program of floggings, solitary confinement, and executions\r\nfor the inmates for infractions of the rules. (_778-PS_) Among the\r\nrules were those prescribing a rigid censorship concerning conditions\r\nwithin the camp:\r\n\r\n    “By virture of the law on revolutionaries, the following\r\n    offenders, considered as _agitators, will be hung_. Anyone who,\r\n    for the purpose of agitating, does the following in the camp, at\r\n    work, in the quarters, in the kitchens and workshops, toilets\r\n    and places of rest: politicizes, holds inciting speeches and\r\n    meetings, forms cliques, loiters around with others; who for the\r\n    purpose of supplying the propaganda of the opposition with\r\n    atrocity stories, collects true or false information about the\r\n    concentration camp and its institution; receives such\r\n    information, buries it, talks about it to others, smuggles it\r\n    out of the camp into the hands of foreign visitors or others by\r\n    means of clandestine or other methods, passes it on in writing\r\n    or orally to released prisoners or prisoners who are placed\r\n    above them, conceals it in clothing or other articles, throws\r\n    stones and other objects over the camp wall containing such\r\n    information; or produces secret documents; who, for the purpose\r\n    of agitating, climbs on barracks’ roofs and trees, seeks contact\r\n    with the outside by giving light or other signals, or induces\r\n    others to escape or commit a crime, gives them advices to that\r\n    effect or supports such undertakings in any way whatsover.”\r\n    (_778-PS_)\r\n\r\nCensorship concerning the camps was complemented by an officially\r\ninspired rumor campaign outside the camps. Concentration camps were\r\nspoken of in whispers, and the whispers were spread by agents of the\r\nsecret police. A “Top Secret” order, relating to concentration camps,\r\nissued by the Head of the Gestapo and distributed to appropriate police\r\nofficers, and dated 26 October 1939, provides:\r\n\r\n    “In order to achieve a further deterrent effect, the following\r\n    must, in future, be observed in each individual case * * *\r\n\r\n    “3. _The length of the period of custody must in no case be made\r\n    known_, even if the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German\r\n    Police or the Chief of the Security Police and the SD has\r\n    already fixed it.\r\n\r\n    “The term of commitment to a concentration camp is to be openly\r\n    announced as ‘until further notice.’\r\n\r\n    “In most serious cases, there is no objection to the increasing\r\n    of the deterrent effect by the spreading of cleverly carried out\r\n    _rumour propaganda_, more or less to the effect that, according\r\n    to hearsay, in view of the seriousness of his case, the arrested\r\n    man will not be released for 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\n    “4. In certain cases, the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the\r\n    German Police will order flogging in addition to detention in a\r\n    concentration camp. Orders of this kind will, in future, also be\r\n    transmitted to the State Police District Office concerned. In\r\n    this case too, there is no objection to spreading the rumor of\r\n    this increased punishment as laid down in Section 3, paragraph\r\n    3, in so far as this appears suitable, to add to the deterrent\r\n    effect.\r\n\r\n    “5. Naturally, particularly suitable and reliable people are to\r\n    be chosen for the spreading of such news.” (_1531-PS_)\r\n\r\n             6. THE TREATMENT OF CONCENTRATION CAMP VICTIMS\r\n\r\nThe deterrent effect of the concentration camps was based on the promise\r\nof savage brutality. This promise was fulfilled, to an extent which\r\ndefies description. Once in the custody of the SS guards, the victim was\r\nbeaten, tortured, starved, and often murdered through the so-called\r\n“extermination through work” program, or through mass execution gas\r\nchambers and furnaces of the camps (which were portrayed in the motion\r\npicture evidence). The reports of official government investigations\r\nfurnish additional evidence of conditions within the concentration\r\ncamps. The official report concerning the concentration camp\r\nFlossenberg, prefaced by the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the\r\nUnited States Army, dated 21 June 1945, and supported by attached\r\naffidavits and testimony, contains this description:\r\n\r\n    “The work at these camps mainly consisted of underground labor,\r\n    the purpose being the construction of large underground\r\n    factories, storage rooms, etc. This labor was performed\r\n    completely underground and as a result of the brutal treatment,\r\n    working and living conditions, a daily average of 100 prisoners\r\n    died. To the one camp Oberstaubling, 700 prisoners were\r\n    transported in February 1945 and on the 15th of April 1945 only\r\n    405 of these men were living. During the 12 months preceding the\r\n    liberation, Flossenburg and the branch camps under its control\r\n    accounted for the death of 14,739 male inmates and 1,300 women.\r\n    These figures represent the deaths as were obtained from the\r\n    available records in the camp, however, they are in no way\r\n    complete as many secret mass executions and deaths took place.\r\n    In 1941 an additional stockade was added at the Flossenburg\r\n    camp, to hold 2,000 Russian prisoners. From these 2,000\r\n    prisoners only 102 survived.\r\n\r\n    “Flossenburg Concentration Camp can best be described as a\r\n    factory dealing in death. Although this camp had in view the\r\n    primary object of putting to work the mass slave labor, another\r\n    of its primary objectives was the elimination of human lives by\r\n    the methods employed in handling the prisoners.\r\n\r\n    “Hunger and starvation rations, sadism, housing facilities,\r\n    inadequate clothing, medical neglect, disease, beatings,\r\n    hangings, freezing, hand hanging, forced suicides, shooting, all\r\n    played a major role in obtaining their objective. Prisoners were\r\n    murdered at random; spite killings against Jews were common.\r\n    Injections of poison and shooting in the neck were everyday\r\n    occurrences. Epidemics of typhus and spotted fever were\r\n    permitted to run rampant as a means of eliminating prisoners.\r\n    Life in this camp meant nothing. Killing became a common thing,\r\n    so common that a quick death was welcomed by the unfortunate\r\n    ones.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “On Christmas 1944 a number of prisoners were hung at one time.\r\n    The prisoners were forced to view this hanging. By the side of\r\n    the gallows was a decorated Christmas tree and as expressed by\r\n    one prisoner ‘it was a terrible sight, that combination of\r\n    prisoners hanging in the air and the glistening Christmas tree’.\r\n\r\n    “In March or April, 13 American or British parachutists were\r\n    hung. They had been delivered to this camp sometime before and\r\n    had been captured while trying to blow up bridges.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “On April 20, 1945, approximately 15,000 prisoners were\r\n    assembled to make a forced march in the direction of\r\n    Concentration Camp Dachau. The evacuation of these prisoners was\r\n    caused by the impending capture of the camp by the Allies. These\r\n    15,000 prisoners were lined up in three groups and started on\r\n    this march. Only those prisoners who could walk were taken and\r\n    before leaving Flossenburg, many were executed, as also were\r\n    those who collapsed in rank awaiting the movement to start the\r\n    trek. No provision was made for the feeding of these prisoners\r\n    or sleeping on this trip. They marched in long columns guarded\r\n    by SS Guards.\r\n\r\n    “Thousands were killed on the way and the paths which they took\r\n    were littered with the dead. Groups of from 5 to 50 were taken\r\n    out and forced to dig pits and then were shot. Many graves were\r\n    not even covered. As the already starved and weakened prisoners\r\n    fell from exhaustion, a group of SS guards bringing up the rear\r\n    would kill them by a shot in the back of the head. All who fell\r\n    out of line were immediately executed in this manner. Death was\r\n    also caused by beatings or bashings in the skulls.\r\n\r\n    “The prisoners marched from Friday till Monday during which time\r\n    they received only 100 grams of bread. They marched in the rain\r\n    and slept in the fields in the mud and water. Many died from\r\n    exhaustion. On the 23rd day of April 1945, between the towns of\r\n    Cham and Roding, they were liberated by the American troops.”\r\n    (_2309-PS_)\r\n\r\nConditions at Mauthausen, one of the most notorious extermination\r\ncenters, are thus described in an official report of the office of the\r\nJudge Advocate General of the Third United States Army, dated 17 June\r\n1945:\r\n\r\n    “V. _Conclusions._ There is no doubt that Mauthausen was the\r\n    basis for long term planning. It was constructed as a gigantic\r\n    stone fortress on top of a mountain flanked by small barracks.\r\n\r\n    “Mauthausen, in addition to its permanency of construction had\r\n    facilities for a large garrison of officers and men, and had\r\n    large dining rooms and toilet facilities for the staff. It was\r\n    conducted with the sole purpose in mind of exterminating any\r\n    so-called prisoner who entered within its walls. The so-called\r\n    branches of Mauthausen were under direct command of the SS\r\n    officials located there. All records, orders, and administrative\r\n    facilities were handled for these branches through Mauthausen.\r\n    The other camps, including Gusen and Ebensee, its two most\r\n    notorious and largest branches, were not exclusively used for\r\n    extermination but prisoners were used as tools in construction\r\n    and production until they were beaten or starved into\r\n    uselessness, whereupon they were customarily sent to Mauthausen\r\n    for final disposal.” (_2176-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt is clear from both the motion picture and these reports, which could\r\nbe supplemented by many similar ones, that the brutal conditions in all\r\nconcentration camps followed the same general pattern. The widespread\r\nincidence of these conditions makes it clear that they were not the\r\nresult of sporadic excesses on the part of individual jailers, but were\r\nthe result of policies deliberately imposed from above.\r\n\r\nThe crimes committed by the Nazis in the concentration camp were on so\r\nvast a scale that individual atrocities pale into insignificance. But\r\nthere are two exhibits in the possession of the prosecution which\r\nillustrate the contempt in which the Nazis held human values. The first\r\nis a frame showing sections of human skin, taken from human bodies in\r\nBuchenwald Concentration Camp and preserved as ornaments. (This was\r\noffered by the prosecution as a physical exhibit.) They were selected\r\nbecause of the tattooing which appeared on the skin. Attached to this\r\nexhibit is an extract of an official U. S. Army report describing the\r\ncircumstances under which this exhibit was obtained (_3420-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “Mobile Field Interrogation Unit No. 2\r\n\r\n                        PW INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN\r\n\r\n    “No. 2/20\r\n\r\n                                                    19 December 1944\r\n        “Address Briefs and Requests to HQ, FID, MIS, APO 887\r\n                               “_EXTRACT_\r\n\r\n    “13. _Concentration Camp, Buchenwald._\r\n\r\n    “_Preamble._ The author of this account is PW Andreas\r\n    Pfaffenberger, 1 Coy, 9 Landesschuetzen Bn. 43 years old and of\r\n    limited education, he is a butcher by trade. The substantial\r\n    agreement of the details of his story with those found in PWIS\r\n    (H)/LF/736 establishes the validity of his testimony.\r\n\r\n    “PW has not been questioned on statements which, in the light of\r\n    what is known, are apparently erroneous in certain details, nor\r\n    has any effort been made to alter the subjective character of\r\n    PW’s account, which he wrote without being told anything of the\r\n    intelligence already known.

No one knew what the purpose was. But\r\n    after the tattooed prisoners had been examined, the ones with\r\n    the best and most artistic specimens were kept in the\r\n    dispensary, and then killed by injections, administered by Karl\r\n    Beigs, a criminal prisoner. The corpses were then turned over to\r\n    the pathological department, where the desired pieces of\r\n    tattooed skin were detached from the bodies and treated. The\r\n    finished products were turned over to SS Standartenfuehrer\r\n    Koch’s wife, who had them fashioned into lampshades and other\r\n    ornamental household articles. I myself saw such tattooed skins\r\n    with various designs and legends on them, such as “Hans’l und\r\n    Gret’l”, which one prisoner had had on his knee, and ships from\r\n    prisoners’ chests. This work was done by a prisoner named\r\n    Wernerbach.” (_3420-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe following certificate is also attached to the exhibit:\r\n\r\n    “I, George C. Demas, Lieut., USNR., associated with the United\r\n    States Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality,\r\n    hereby certify that the attached exhibit, consisting of\r\n    parchment, was delivered by the War Crimes Section, Judge\r\n    Advocate General, U. S. Army, to me in my above capacity, in the\r\n    usual course of official business, as an exhibit found in\r\n    Buchenwald Camp and captured by military forces under the\r\n    command of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Forces.”\r\n    (_3421-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis is the conclusion reached in an official U. S. Army report attached\r\nto the exhibit:\r\n\r\n    “Based on the findings in paragraph 2, all three specimens are\r\n    tattooed human skin”. (_3423-PS_)\r\n\r\nOne more example of this pathological phase of Nazi culture, another\r\nNazi trophy, is a human head with the skull bone removed, shrunken,\r\nstuffed, and preserved. (This was offered by the prosecution as a\r\nphysical exhibit.) This head probably belonged to a foreign worker,\r\nkidnapped by Sauckel to work in Speer’s armament industry. The Nazis had\r\none of their many victims decapitated after having had him hanged for\r\nfraternizing with a German woman; they fashioned this ornament from his\r\nhead. This represents the end product of the Nazi system, representing\r\nboth the degradation of the Nazi “master” and the anguish of his victim.\r\nThe official U. S. Army report attached to this exhibit deals with the\r\nmanner in which this exhibit was acquired. It reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “There I also saw the shrunken heads of two young Poles who had\r\n    been hanged for having relations with German girls. The heads\r\n    were the size of a fist, and the hair and the marks of the rope\r\n    were still there.” (_3423-PS_)\r\n\r\n                        7. THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS\r\n\r\nNo accurate estimate of how many persons died in the concentration camps\r\ncan be made. Although the Nazis were generally meticulous record\r\nkeepers, the records they kept about concentration camps appear to have\r\nbeen incomplete.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there is a death book, or a set of index cards, but for the\r\nmost part, the victims apparently faded into an unrecorded death. The\r\nscale of the concentration camp operations is suggested by a set of\r\nseven books, the death ledger of the Mauthausen Concentration Camp\r\n(physically offered to the court). Each book bears on its cover\r\n“_Totenbuch_” or Death Book—Mauthausen. In these books were recorded\r\nthe names of some of the inmates who died or were murdered in this camp.\r\nThe books cover the period from January 1939 to April 1945. They give\r\nthe name, place of birth, the assigned cause of death and time of death\r\nof each individual recorded. In addition each corpse is assigned a\r\nserial number. Addition of the serial numbers for the five-year period\r\nproduces a total figure of 35,318.\r\n\r\nExamination of the books reveals the camp’s routine of death. For\r\nexample, pages 568 to 582 of Volume 5 cover death entries made for 19\r\nMarch 1945 between fifteen minutes past one in the morning until 2\r\no’clock in the afternoon. In this space of 12¾ hours, 203 persons are\r\nreported as having died. They were assigned serial numbers running from\r\n8390 to 8593. The names of the dead are listed. The victims are all\r\nrecorded as having died of the same ailment—“heart trouble”. They died\r\nat brief intervals. They died in alphabetical order. The first who died\r\nwas a man named Ackermann who died at one fifteen A.M. The last was a\r\nman named Zynger who died at 2 o’clock P.M.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes past two o’clock on the afternoon of the same day, 19\r\nMarch 1945, the fatal roll call began again, and continued until half\r\npast four o’clock. In a space of two hours, 75 more persons died. Once\r\nagain they died from heart failure and in alphabetical order. The\r\nentries are recorded in the same volume, from pages 582 through 586.\r\n\r\nAnother death book was found at Camp Mauthausen. This is a single\r\nvolume, which has on its cover the words—“Death Book—Prisoners of\r\nWar”. Pages 234 through 246 contain entries recording the names of 208\r\nprisoners of war, apparently Russians, who at 15 minutes past midnight\r\non the 10th day of May 1942, were executed at the same time. The book\r\nnotes that the execution was directed by the Chief of the SD and the\r\nSIPO (Heydrich).\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that the anguish of the concentration camp was\r\nspread, not only over the Continent of Europe, but over all the world.\r\nEven today all over the world people are still seeking word of their\r\nfriends and relatives who vanished into the Nazi concentration camps and\r\nleft no trace behind. This fact is emphasized by the 23 November 1945\r\nissue of the weekly newspaper, “_Aufbau_”, published in the German\r\nlanguage in New York City. On the back pages—8, 9, 10, and 11—are\r\npublished both notices requesting information about friends and\r\nrelatives, and notices announcing the deaths of persons who were last\r\nheard of in a Nazi concentration camp. The personal tragedies, which\r\nthese notices represent, multiplied an incalculable number of times, is\r\npart of the legacy which the Nazi conspirators have left to the world.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (b, c).           │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections III;    │      │ 15, 31,\r\n                │  VIII (A, C); X.                       │  I   │  41, 53\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n 3737-PS        │Hague Convention of 1907 respecting the │      │\r\n                │  Laws and Customs of War on Land,      │      │\r\n                │  Annex, Article 46.                    │  VI  │     597\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n 3738-PS        │Geneva Convention of 1929 relative to   │      │\r\n                │  treatment of Prisoners of War,        │      │\r\n                │  Articles 2, 3.                        │  VI  │     600\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

In planning for\r\nfuture wars it was determined that the home front must be secured to\r\nprevent a repetition of this 1918 debacle. Unification of the German\r\npeople was essential to successful planning and waging of war. Hence,\r\nthe Nazi political goal must be sought:—“One race, one State, one\r\nFuehrer.” Free trade unions must be abolished, political parties (other\r\nthan the NSDAP) must be outlawed, civil liberties must be suspended, and\r\nopposition of every kind must be swept away. Loyalty to God, church, and\r\nscientific truth was declared to be incompatible with the Nazi regime.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Jewish policy was part of this plan for unification because it\r\nwas the conviction of the Nazis that the Jews would not contribute to\r\nGermany’s military program, but on the contrary would hamper it. The Jew\r\nmust therefore be eliminated. This view is clearly borne out by a\r\nstatement contained in a speech of Himmler’s at a meeting of SS Major\r\nGenerals on 4 October 1943:\r\n\r\n    “We know how difficult we should have made it for ourselves if\r\n    with the bombing raids, the burdens and deprivations of war, we\r\n    still had the Jews today in every town as secret saboteurs,\r\n    agitators, and trouble-mongers; we would now probably have\r\n    reached the 1916-17 stage when the Jews were still in the German\r\n    national body.” (_1919-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the Jews within Germany was as much a part of the Nazi\r\nplan for aggressive war as was the building of armaments and the\r\nconscription of manpower.\r\n\r\n                    1. HATE-PROPAGANDA AGAINST JEWS\r\n\r\nThe objective of the elimination and extermination of the Jews, could\r\nnot be accomplished without certain preliminary measures. One of these\r\nwas the indoctrination of the German people with hatred against the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nThe first evidence of the Party policies in this direction was expressed\r\nin the Party program of February 1920 (_1708-PS_). Paragraphs (4) and\r\n(6) of that program declared:\r\n\r\n    “* * * Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of\r\n    the race can only be one who is of German blood without\r\n    consideration of confession.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * The right to determine matters concerning administration\r\n    and law belongs only to the citizen; therefore, we demand that\r\n    every public office of any sort whatsoever, whether in the\r\n    Reich, the county or municipality, be filled only by citizens.”\r\n    (_1708-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler, at page 724 and 725 of _Mein Kampf_, spoke of the Jew. If the\r\nNational Socialist movement was to fulfill its task, he declared:\r\n\r\n    “It must open the eyes of the people with regard to foreign\r\n    nations and must remind them again and again of the true enemy\r\n    of our present day world. In the place of hate against\r\n    Aryans—from whom we may be separated by almost everything, to\r\n    whom, however, we are tied by common blood or the great tide of\r\n    a common culture—it must dedicate to the general anger the evil\r\n    enemy of mankind as the true cause of all suffering.\r\n\r\n    “It must see to it, however, that at least in our country he be\r\n    recognized as the most mortal enemy and that the struggle\r\n    against him may show, like a flaming beacon of a better era, to\r\n    other nations too, the road to salvation for a struggling Aryan\r\n    mankind.” (_2662-PS_)\r\n\r\nA flood of abusive literature of all types and for all age groups was\r\npublished and circulated throughout Germany. Illustrative of this type\r\nof publication is the book _Der Giftpilz_. (_1778-PS_). This book brands\r\nthe Jew as a persecutor of the labor class, a race defiler, a devil in\r\nhuman form, a poisonous mushroom, and a murderer. This particular book\r\nwas used to instruct school children to recognize the Jew by caricatures\r\nof his physical features, (pages 6 and 7); and to teach them that the\r\nJew abuses little boys and girls, (page 30), and that the Jewish Bible\r\npermits all crimes (pages 13-17). Streicher’s periodical, _Der\r\nStuermer_, (issue no. 14 for April 1937) in particular, went to such\r\nextremes as to publish the statement that Jews at the ritual celebration\r\nof their Passover slaughtered Christians:\r\n\r\n    “The numerous confessions made by the Jews show that the\r\n    execution of ritual murders is a law to the Talmud Jew. The\r\n    former chief rabbi, and later monk, Teofite, declared that the\r\n    ritual murders take place especially on the Jewish Purim in\r\n    memory of the Persian murders, and Passover in memory of the\r\n    murder of Christ. The instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The blood of the victims is to be tapped by force. On Passover\r\n    it is to be used in wine and matzos. Thus, a small part of the\r\n    blood is to be poured into the dough of the matzos and into the\r\n    wine. The mixing is done by the Jewish head of the family. The\r\n    procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The family head empties a few drops of the fresh and powdered\r\n    blood into the glass, wets the fingers of the left hand with it\r\n    and sprays, blesses, with it everything on the table. The head\r\n    of the family then says, ‘Thus we ask God to send the ten\r\n    plagues to all enemies of the Jewish faith.’ Then they eat, and\r\n    at the end the head of the family exclaims, ‘May all Gentiles\r\n    perish, as the child whose blood is contained in the bread and\r\n    wine.’\r\n\r\n    “The fresh, or dried and powdered blood of the slaughtered is\r\n    further used by young married Jewish couples, by pregnant\r\n    Jewesses, for circumcision and so on. Ritual murder is\r\n    recognized by all Talmud Jews. The Jew believes he absolves\r\n    himself thus of his sins.” (_2699-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe Jew-baiting publication, _Der Stuermer_, was published by\r\nStreicher’s publishing firm (_2697-PS_). In one issue of this\r\nperiodical, Streicher, speaking of the Jewish faith, said:\r\n\r\n    “The Holy Scripture is a horrible criminal romance abounding\r\n    with murder, incest, fraud and indecency.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Talmud is the great Jewish book of crimes that the Jew\r\n    practices in his daily life.” (_2698-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis propaganda campaign of hate, of which the above quotations are but\r\nrandom samples, was too widespread and notorious to require further\r\nelaboration.\r\n\r\n                 2. DISCRIMINATORY DECREES AGAINST JEWS\r\n\r\nWhen the Nazi Party gained control of the German State, the conspirators\r\nused the means of official decrees as a weapon against the Jews. In this\r\nway the force of the state was applied against them.\r\n\r\nJewish immigrants were denaturalized (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I,\r\npage 480, signed by Frick and Neurath).\r\n\r\nNative Jews were precluded from citizenship (1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 1146, signed by Frick).\r\n\r\nJews were forbidden to live in marriage or to have extra-marital\r\nrelations with persons of German blood (1935 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part\r\nI, page 1146, signed by Frick and Hess).\r\n\r\nJews were denied the right to vote (1936 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I,\r\npage 133, signed by Frick).\r\n\r\nJews were denied the right to hold public office or civil service\r\npositions (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 277, signed by Frick).\r\n\r\nJews were relegated to an inferior status by the denial of common\r\nprivileges and freedoms. Thus, they were denied access to certain city\r\nareas, sidewalks, transportation, places of amusement, restaurants (1938\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1676).\r\n\r\nProgressively, more and more stringent measures were applied, even to\r\nthe denial of private pursuits. They were excluded from the practice of\r\ndentistry (1939 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 47, signed by Hess).\r\n\r\nThe practice of law was denied to them (1938 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part\r\nI, page 1403, signed by Frick and Hess).\r\n\r\nThe practice of medicine was forbidden them (1938 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, page 969, signed by Frick and Hess).\r\n\r\nThey were denied employment by press and radio (1933\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 661).\r\n\r\nThey were excluded from stock exchanges and stock brokerage (1934\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 661).\r\n\r\nThey were excluded from farming (1933 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n685).\r\n\r\nIn 1938 they were excluded from business in general and from the\r\neconomic life of Germany (1938 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1580,\r\nsigned by Goering).\r\n\r\nThe Jews were also forced to pay discriminatory taxes and huge atonement\r\nfines. Their homes, bank accounts, real estate, and intangibles were\r\nexpropriated.\r\n\r\nA report of a conference under the chairmanship of Goering, and attended\r\nby Funk, among others, which was held at 11 o’clock on 12 November 1938\r\nat the Reich Ministry for Air, quotes Goering as saying:\r\n\r\n    “One more question, gentlemen, what would you think the\r\n    situation would be if I’d announced today that Jewry shall have\r\n    to contribute this one billion as a punishment.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I shall choose the wording this way that German Jewry shall, as\r\n    punishment for their abominable crimes, etc., etc., have to make\r\n    a contribution of one billion; that’ll work. The pigs won’t\r\n    commit another murder. I’d like to say again that I would not\r\n    like to be a Jew in Germany.” (_1816-PS_)\r\n\r\nFollowing these whimsical remarks a decree was issued over the signature\r\nof Goering, fining German Jews the sum of one billion Reichsmarks (1938\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 1579, dated 12 November 1938, signed\r\nby Goering).\r\n\r\nSimilar decrees are contained in 1939 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n282, signed by Goering; and in 1941 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page\r\n722, signed by Frick and Bormann.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1943, the Jews were placed beyond the protection of any\r\njudicial process by a decree signed by Bormann and Frick, among others;\r\nthe police were made the sole arbiters of punishment and death (1943\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, page 372, signed by Frick and Bormann).\r\n\r\n              3. ANTI-JEWISH BOYCOTTS, RAIDS, AND VIOLENCE\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the passage of these decrees and their execution,\r\nstill another weapon was wielded by the Party and the party-controlled\r\nstate. This was the openly sponsored and official anti-Jewish boycotts.\r\nThe published diary of Joseph Goebbels, at page 290, contains this entry\r\nfor 29 March 1933:\r\n\r\n    “The boycott appeal is approved by the entire cabinet.”\r\n    (_2409-PS_)\r\n\r\nAgain, on 31 March 1933, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    “We are having a last discussion among a very small circle and\r\n    decide that the boycott is to start tomorrow with all severity.”\r\n    (_2409-PS_)\r\n\r\nStreicher and Frank, together with Himmler, Ley, and others, were\r\nmembers of a central committee who conducted the 1933 boycott against\r\nthe Jews. Their names are listed in National Socialist Party\r\ncorrespondence for 29 March 1933. (_2156-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn this early 1933 violence against the Jews, raids were conducted on\r\nsynagogues by uniformed Nazis. Attending members of the synagogues were\r\nassaulted, and religious insignia and emblems were desecrated. A report\r\nof such an occurrence was contained in an official dispatch from the\r\nAmerican Consul General in Leipzig, dated 5 April, 1943, which stated:\r\n\r\n    “In Dresden several weeks ago uniformed Nazis raided the Jewish\r\n    prayer house, interrupted the evening religious service,\r\n    arrested 25 worshippers, and tore the holy insignia or emblems\r\n    from their headcovering worn while praying.” (_2709-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting in Nurnberg, before the representatives of the German\r\npress, Streicher and Mayor Liebel of Nurnberg revealed in advance to the\r\ngathered members of the press that the Nurnberg synagogue was to be\r\ndestroyed. The minutes of this meeting, dated 4 August 1938, read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                   “The breaking up of the synagogue\r\n                   (information must still be secret)\r\n\r\n    “On August 10, 1938 at 10 o’clock a. m., the breakup of the\r\n    synagogues will commence. Gauleiter Julius Streicher will\r\n    personally set the crane into motion with which the Jewish\r\n    symbols, Star of David, etc., will be torn down. This should be\r\n    arranged in a big way. Closer details are still unknown.”\r\n    (_1724-PS_)\r\n\r\nStreicher himself supervised the demolition, according to a newspaper\r\naccount of 11 August 1938, which described the scene:\r\n\r\n    “In Nurnberg the Synagogue is being demolished; Julius Streicher\r\n    himself inaugurates the work by a speech lasting more than an\r\n    hour and a half. By his order then—so to speak as a prelude of\r\n    the demolition—the tremendous Star of David came off the\r\n    cupola.” (_2711-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese accounts of violence were not localized anti-Semitic\r\ndemonstrations, but were directed and ordered from a centralized\r\nheadquarters in Berlin. This fact is established by a series of teletype\r\nmessages sent by the Berlin Secret State Police Headquarters to police\r\nchiefs throughout Germany on 10 November 1938, which contained\r\ninstructions pertaining to the prearranged demonstration (_3051-PS_).\r\nOne of these confidential orders, signed by Heydrich, provides:\r\n\r\n    “Because of the attempt on the life of the Secretary of the\r\n    Legation von Rath in Paris tonight, 9-10 November 1938,\r\n    demonstrations against Jews are to be expected throughout the\r\n    Reich. The following instructions are given on how to treat\r\n    these events:\r\n\r\n    “1. The Chiefs of the State Police, or their deputies, must get\r\n    in telephonic contact with the political leaders who have\r\n    jurisdiction over their districts and have to arrange a joint\r\n    meeting with the appropriate inspector or commander of the Order\r\n    Police to discuss the organization of the demonstrations. At\r\n    these discussions the political leaders have to be informed that\r\n    the German police has received from the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\n    Chief of the German Police the following instructions, in\r\n    accordance with which the political leaders should adjust their\r\n    own measures.\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Only such measures should be taken which do not involve\r\n    danger to German life or property. (For instance synagogues are\r\n    to be burned down only when there is no danger of fire to the\r\n    surroundings.)\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Business and private apartments of Jews may be destroyed\r\n    but not looted. The police is instructed to supervise the\r\n    execution of this order and to arrest looters.” (_3051-PS_)\r\n\r\n          4. THE PROGRAM FOR THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF JEWRY\r\n\r\nAt this point the gradual and mounting campaign against the Jews was\r\nprepared for the achievement of its ultimate violent ends. The German\r\npeople had been indoctrinated, and the seeds of hatred had been sown.\r\nThe German state was armed and prepared for conquest. The force of world\r\nopinion could now safely be ignored. Already the Nazi conspirators had\r\nforced out of Germany 200,000 of its former 500,000 Jews. The\r\nNazi-controlled German state was therefore emboldened, and Hitler in\r\nanticipation of the aggressive wars already planned cast about for a\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nIn his speech before the Reichstag on 30 January 1939, Hitler declared:\r\n\r\n    “If the international Jewish financiers within and without\r\n    Europe succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world\r\n    war, the result will not be the Bolshevication of the world and\r\n    the victory of Jewry, but the obliteration of the Jewish race in\r\n    Europe.” (_2663-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe chief editor of the official organ of the SS, the “_Schwarze\r\nKorps_,” expressed similar sentiments on 8 August 1940:\r\n\r\n    “Just as the Jewish question will be solved for Germany only\r\n    when the last Jew has been deported, so the rest of Europe\r\n    should also realize that the German peace which awaits it must\r\n    be a peace without Jews.” (_2668-PS_)\r\n\r\nOther officials of the Party and State voiced the same views. Rosenberg\r\nwrote for the publication “World Struggle,” which in the April and\r\nSeptember 1941 issues declared:\r\n\r\n    “The Jewish question will be solved for Europe only when the\r\n    last Jew has left the European continent.” (_2665-PS_)\r\n\r\nHans Frank entered this apologetic note in his diary:\r\n\r\n    “Of course, I could not eliminate all lice and Jews in only a\r\n    year’s time. But in the course of time, and above all, if you\r\n    will help me, this end will be attained.” (_2233-C-PS_)\r\n\r\nA. _Registration._\r\n\r\nThe first step in accomplishing the purpose of the Nazi Party and the\r\nNazi-dominated state, to eliminate the Jew, was to require a complete\r\nregistration of all Jews. Inasmuch as the anti-Jewish policy was linked\r\nwith the program of German aggression, such registration was required\r\nnot only within the Reich, but successively within the conquered\r\nterritories. For example, registration was required, by decree, within\r\nGermany (_Reichsgesetzblatt_ Part I, 1938, page 922, 23 July, signed by\r\nFrick); within Austria (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Volume 1, 1940, page 694,\r\n29 April); within Poland (_Kurjer Krakowski_, 24 October, 1939); in\r\nFrance (_Journal Official_ No. 9, page 92, 30 September, 1940); in\r\nHolland (_Verordnungsblatt_, No. 16, 10 January, 1941, signed by\r\nSeyss-Inquart).\r\n\r\nB. _Segregation into Ghettos._\r\n\r\nThe second step was to segregate and concentrate the Jews within\r\nrestricted areas, called ghettos. This policy was carefully worked out,\r\nas is illustrated by the confidential statement taken from the files of\r\nRosenberg (_212-PS_). This memorandum of Rosenberg’s, entitled\r\n“Directions for Handling of the Jewish Question”, states:\r\n\r\n    “The first main goal of the German measures must be strict\r\n    segregation of Jewry from the rest of the population. In the\r\n    execution of this, first of all, is the seizing of the Jewish\r\n    population by the introduction of a registration order and\r\n    similar appropriate measures * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * All rights of freedom for Jews are to be withdrawn. They\r\n    are to be placed in ghettos and at the same time are to be\r\n    separated according to sexes. The presence of many more or less\r\n    closed Jewish settlements in White Ruthenia and in the Ukraine\r\n    makes this mission easier. Moreover, places are to be chosen\r\n    which make possible the full use of the Jewish manpower in case\r\n    labor needs are present. These ghettos can be placed under the\r\n    supervision of a Jewish self-government with Jewish officials.\r\n    The guarding of the boundaries between the ghettos and the outer\r\n    world, is, however, the duty of the Police.\r\n\r\n    “Also, in the cases in which a ghetto could not yet be\r\n    established, care is to be taken through strict prohibitions and\r\n    similar suitable measures that a further intermingling of blood\r\n    of the Jews and the rest of the populace does not continue.”\r\n    (_212-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn May 1941 Rosenberg, as the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories, issued directions confining the Jews to ghettos in the\r\nUkraine:\r\n\r\n    “After the customary removal of Jews from all public offices,\r\n    the Jewish question will have to have a decisive solution,\r\n    through the institution of ghettos.” (_1028-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe policies set forth in the foregoing utterances of Rosenberg were not\r\naccidental, isolated, or the views of one individual. They were the\r\nexpressed State policies. Von Schirach played his part in the program of\r\nghettoization. His speech before the European Youth Congress held in\r\nVienna on 14 September 1942 was reported on page 2, column 2 of the\r\nVienna edition of the “_Voelkischer Beobachter_” of 15 September, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Every Jew who exerts influence in Europe is a danger to\r\n    European culture. If anyone reproaches me with having driven\r\n    from this city, which was once the European metropolis of Jewry,\r\n    tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of Jews into the ghetto\r\n    of the East, I feel myself compelled to reply: I see in this an\r\n    action contributing to European culture.” (_3048-PS_)\r\n\r\nOne of the largest ghettos was within the city of Warsaw. The official\r\nreport made by SS Major General Stroop concerning this ghetto is\r\nentitled “The Warsaw Ghetto Is No More.” (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report thus describes the ghetto:\r\n\r\n    “The Ghetto thus established in Warsaw was inhabited by about\r\n    400,000 Jews. It contained 27,000 apartments with an average of\r\n    2½ rooms each. It was separated from the rest of the city by\r\n    partition and other walls, and by walling-up of the\r\n    thoroughfares, windows, doors, open spaces, etc. * * *”\r\n    (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nConditions within this ghetto are indicated in the statement of the\r\nreport that an average of six persons lived in every room. (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nHimmler received a report from the SS Brigade Fuehrer Group A, dated 15\r\nOctober 1941, which further illustrates the establishment and operation\r\nof the ghettos. (_L-180_) The report states:\r\n\r\n    “Apart from organizing and carrying out measures of execution,\r\n    the creation of ghettos was begun in the larger towns at once\r\n    during the first day of operations. This was especially urgent\r\n    in Knowno because there were 30,000 Jews in a total population\r\n    of 152,400.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In Riga the so-called ‘_Moskau Suburb_’ was designated as a\r\n    ghetto. This is the worst dwelling district of Riga, already now\r\n    mostly inhabited by Jews. The transfer of the Jews into the\r\n    ghetto district proved rather difficult because the Latvians\r\n    dwelling in that district had to be evacuated and residential\r\n    space in Riga is very crowded. 24,000 of the 28,000 Jews living\r\n    in Riga have been transferred into the ghetto so far. In\r\n    creating the ghetto, the Security Police restricted themselves\r\n    to mere policing duties, while the establishment and\r\n    administration of the ghetto as well as the regulation of the\r\n    food supply for the inmates of the ghetto were left to civil\r\n    administration; the labor officers were left in charge of Jewish\r\n    labor.\r\n\r\n    “In the other towns with a larger Jewish population ghettos\r\n    shall be established likewise.” (_L-180_)\r\n\r\nJews were forced into ghettos in the Polish Province of Galicia. The\r\nconditions in these ghettos are described in the report from Katzmann,\r\nLt. General of Police, to Krueger, General of the Police East, dated 20\r\nJune 1943, and entitled “Solution of Jewish Question in Galicia.”\r\n(_L-18_):\r\n\r\n    “Nothing but catastrophical conditions were found in the ghettos\r\n    of Rawa-Ruska and Rohatyn * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * The Jews of Rawa-Ruska, fearing the evacuation, had\r\n    concealed those suffering from spotted fever in underground\r\n    holes. When evacuation was to start the police found that 3,000\r\n    Jews suffering from spotted fever lay about in this ghetto. In\r\n    order to destroy this center of pestilence at once every police\r\n    officer inoculated against spotted fever was called into action.\r\n    Thus we succeeded to destroy this plague-boil, losing thereby\r\n    only one officer. Almost the same conditions were found in\r\n    Rohatyn * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Since we received more and more alarming reports on the Jews\r\n    becoming armed in an ever-increasing manner, we started during\r\n    the last fortnight in June 1943 an action throughout the whole\r\n    of the district of Galicia with the intent to use strongest\r\n    measures to destroy the Jewish gangsterdom. Special measures\r\n    were found necessary during the action to dissolve the ghetto in\r\n    Lwow where the dug-out mentioned above had been established.\r\n    Here we had to act brutally from the beginning, in order to\r\n    avoid losses on our side; we had to blow up, or to burn down\r\n    several houses. On this occasion the surprising fact arose that\r\n    we were able to catch about 20,000 Jews instead of 12,000 Jews\r\n    who had registered. We had to pull at least 3,000 Jewish corpses\r\n    out of every kind of hiding places; they had committed suicide\r\n    by taking poison. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * Despite the extraordinary burden heaped upon every single\r\n    SS-Police officer during these actions, mood and spirit of the\r\n    men were extraordinarily good and praiseworthy from the first to\r\n    the last day * * *.” (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nThese acts of removal and slaughter were not entirely without profit.\r\nThe report continues:\r\n\r\n    “Together with the evacuation action, we executed the\r\n    confiscation of Jewish property. Very high amounts were\r\n    confiscated and paid over to the Special Staff ‘Reinhard’. Apart\r\n    from furniture and many textile goods, the following amounts\r\n    were confiscated and turned over to Special Staff ‘Reinhard’ * *\r\n    *\r\n\r\n   “20.952 kilograms of gold wedding rings.\r\n         7 Stamp collections, complete.\r\n         1 Suit case with pocket knives.\r\n         1 basket of fountain pens and propelled pencils.\r\n         3 bags filled with rings—not genuine.\r\n        35 wagons of furs.” (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nThe thoroughness of the looting is illustrated by an item listing 11.73\r\nkilograms of gold teeth and inlays. (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1942, Jews in the General Government of Poland had been\r\ncrowded into fifty-five localities, whereas before the German invasion\r\nthere had been approximately 1,000 Jewish settlements within this same\r\narea. This fact is reported in the 1942 Official Gazette for the General\r\nGovernment, No. 94, page 665, 1 November 1942.\r\n\r\nC. _Forced Labor._\r\n\r\nThe Jews, having been registered and confined within the ghettos, now\r\nfurnished a reservoir for slave labor. The difference between slave\r\nlabor and “labor duty” was this: the latter group were entitled to\r\nreasonable compensation, stated working hours, medical care and\r\nattention, and other social security measures, while the former were\r\ngranted none of these advantages, being in fact, on a level below that\r\nof slaves.\r\n\r\nRosenberg set up within his organization for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories a department which, among other things, was to seek a\r\nsolution for the Jewish problem by means of forced labor. His plans,\r\ncontained in a memorandum entitled “General Organizations and Tasks of\r\nour Office for the General Handling of Problems in the Eastern\r\nTerritory,” and dated 29 April 1941, read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “A general treatment is required for the Jewish problem for\r\n    which a temporary solution will have to be determined (forced\r\n    labor for the Jews, creation of Ghettos, etc.).” (_1024-PS_)\r\n\r\nThereafter Rosenberg issued instructions that Jewish forced labor should\r\nbe utilized for every manual labor task:\r\n\r\n    “The standing rule for the Jewish labor employment is the\r\n    complete and unyielding use of Jewish manpower regardless of age\r\n    in the reconstruction of the occupied eastern territories.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Violations against German measures, especially against the\r\n    forced labor regulations, are to be punished by death to the\r\n    Jews.” (_212-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrom the ghettos Jewish labor was selected and sent to a concentration\r\narea. Here the usable Jews were screened from those considered\r\nworthless. For example, a contingent of 45,000 Jews could be expected to\r\nyield 10,000 to 15,000 usable laborers. This estimate is based on an\r\nRSHA telegram to Himmler, marked “Urgent” and “Secret”, and dated 16\r\nDecember 1942.\r\n\r\n    “In the total of 45,000 are included physically handicapped and\r\n    others (old Jews and children). In making a distribution for\r\n    this purpose, at least 10,000 to 15,000 laborers will be\r\n    available when the Jews arriving at Auschwitz are assigned.”\r\n    (_1472-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report from Lieutenant General of Police, Katzmann, to General of\r\nthe Police East, Krueger, clearly outlines the nature of the Jewish\r\nforced labor:\r\n\r\n    “The best remedy consisted of the formation, by the SS and\r\n    Police Leader, of forced labor camps. The best opportunity for\r\n    labor was offered by the necessity to complete the ‘Dg.4’ road\r\n    which was extremely important and necessary for the whole of the\r\n    southern part of the front, and which was in a catastrophically\r\n    bad condition. On October 15th 1941, the establishment of camps\r\n    along the road was commenced, and despite considerable\r\n    difficulties there existed, after a few weeks only, seven camps\r\n    containing 4,000 Jews.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Soon more camps followed these first ones, so that after a very\r\n    short time the completion of fifteen camps of this kind could be\r\n    reported to the Superior Leader of SS and Police. In the course\r\n    of time about 20,000 Jewish laborers passed through these camps.\r\n    Despite the hardly imaginable difficulties occurring at this\r\n    work I can report today that about 160 kilometers of the road\r\n    are completed.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “At the same time all other Jews fit for work were registered\r\n    and distributed for useful work by the labor agencies.\r\n\r\n    * * * When the Jews were marked by the Star of David, as well as\r\n    when they were registered by the labor agencies, the first\r\n    symptoms appeared in their attempts to dodge the order of the\r\n    authorities. The measures which were introduced thereupon led to\r\n    thousands of arrests. It became more and more apparent that the\r\n    civil administration was not in a position to solve the Jewish\r\n    problem in an approximately satisfactory manner. Then, for\r\n    instance, the municipal administration at Lwow had no success in\r\n    their attempts to house the Jews within a closed district which\r\n    would be inhabited only by Jews. This question, too, was solved\r\n    quickly by the SS and Police Leaders through subordinate\r\n    officials. This measure became the more urgent as in the winter,\r\n    1941, big centers of spotted fever were noted in many parts of\r\n    the town.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “During this removal of the Jews into a certain quarter of the\r\n    town several sluices were erected at which all the work-shy and\r\n    asocial Jewish rabble were caught during the screening and\r\n    treated in a special way. Owing to the peculiar fact that almost\r\n    90% of artisans working in Galicia were Jews, the task to be\r\n    solved could be fulfilled only step by step, since an immediate\r\n    evacuation would not have served the interest of War Economy.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * Cases were discovered where Jews, in order to acquire any\r\n    certificate of labor, not only renounced all wages, but even\r\n    paid money themselves. Moreover, the organizing of Jews for the\r\n    benefit of their employers grew to such catastrophical extent\r\n    that it was deemed necessary to interfere in the most energetic\r\n    manner for the benefit of the German name. Since the\r\n    administration was not in a position and showed itself too weak\r\n    to master this chaos, the SS and Police Leader simply took over\r\n    the entire disposition of labor for Jews. The Jewish labor\r\n    agencies, which were manned by hundreds of Jews, were dissolved.\r\n    All certificates of labor given by firms or administrative\r\n    offices were declared invalid, and the cards given to the Jews\r\n    by the labor agencies were revalidated by the police offices by\r\n    stamping them. In the course of this action, again, thousands of\r\n    Jews were caught who were in possession of forged certificates\r\n    or who had obtained, surreptitiously, certificates of labor by\r\n    all kinds of pretexts. These Jews also were exposed to special\r\n    treatment.” (_L-18_)\r\n\r\nD. _Extermination._\r\n\r\n(At this point a strip of motion picture footage taken, presumably, by a\r\nmember of the SS, and captured by the United States military forces in\r\nan SS barracks near Augsburg, Germany, was shown to the tribunal. The\r\nfilm depicts what is believed to be the extermination of a ghetto by\r\nGestapo agents, assisted by military units.\r\n\r\nThe following scenes are representative:\r\n\r\nScene 2: A naked girl running across the courtyard.\r\n\r\nScene 3: An older woman being pushed past the camera, and a man in SS\r\nuniform standing at the right of the scene.\r\n\r\nScene 5: A man with a skull cap and a woman are manhandled.\r\n\r\nScene 14: A half-naked woman runs through the crowd.\r\n\r\nScene 15: Another half-naked woman runs out of the house.\r\n\r\nScene 16: Two men drag an old man out.\r\n\r\nScene 18: A man in German military uniform, with his back to the camera,\r\nwatches.\r\n\r\nScene 24: A general shot of the street, showing fallen bodies and naked\r\nwomen running.\r\n\r\nScene 32: A shot of the street, showing five fallen bodies.\r\n\r\nScene 37: A man with a bleeding head is hit again.\r\n\r\nScene 39: A soldier in German military uniform, with a rifle, stands by\r\nas a crowd centers on a man coming out of the house.\r\n\r\nScene 44: A soldier with a rifle, in German military uniform, walks past\r\na woman clinging to a torn blouse.\r\n\r\nScene 45: A woman is dragged by her hair across the street.)\r\n\r\nThe means of accomplishing the extermination of the Jews are discussed\r\nin the diary of Hans Frank, then Governor-General of Occupied Poland\r\n(_2233-D-PS_). In a cabinet session on Tuesday, 16 December 1941 in the\r\nGovernment Building at Cracow, Frank made a closing address, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “As far as the Jews are concerned, I want to tell you quite\r\n    frankly that they must be done away with in one way or another.\r\n    The Fuehrer said once: ‘Should united Jewry again succeed in\r\n    provoking a world-war, the blood of not only the nations which\r\n    have been forced into the war by them, will be shed, but the Jew\r\n    will have found his end in Europe’. I know that many of the\r\n    measures carried out against the Jews in the Reich at present\r\n    are being criticized. It is being tried intentionally, as is\r\n    obvious from the reports on the morale, to talk about cruelty,\r\n    harshness, etc. Before I continue, I want to beg you to agree\r\n    with me on the following formula: We will principally have pity\r\n    on the German people only, and nobody else in the whole world.\r\n    The others, too, had no pity on us. As an old\r\n    National-Socialist, I must say: This war would only be a partial\r\n    success if the whole lot of Jewry would survive it, while we\r\n    would have shed our best blood in order to save Europe. My\r\n    attitude towards the Jews will, therefore, be based only on the\r\n    expectation that they must disappear. They must be done away\r\n    with. I have entered negotiations to have them deported to the\r\n    East. A great discussion concerning that question will take\r\n    place in Berlin in January, to which I am going to delegate the\r\n    State Secretary Dr. Buehler. That discussion is to take place in\r\n    the Reich Security Main Office with SS-Lt. General Heydrich. A\r\n    great Jewish migration will begin, in any case.\r\n\r\n    “But what should be done with the Jews? Do you think they will\r\n    be settled down in the ‘Ostland’, in villages? This is what we\r\n    were told in Berlin: Why all this bother? We can do nothing with\r\n    them either in the ‘Ostland’ nor in the ‘Reichskommissariat’. So\r\n    liquidate them yourself.\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen, I must ask you to rid yourself of all feeling of\r\n    pity. We must annihilate the Jews, wherever we find them and\r\n    wherever it is possible, in order to maintain there the\r\n    structure of the Reich as a whole. This will, naturally, be\r\n    achieved by other methods than those pointed out by Bureau Chief\r\n    Dr. Hummel. Nor can the judges of the Special Courts be made\r\n    responsible for it, because of the limitations of the framework\r\n    of the legal procedure. Such outdated views cannot be applied to\r\n    such gigantic and unique events. We must find at any rate a way\r\n    which leads to the goal, and my thoughts are working in that\r\n    direction.\r\n\r\n    “The Jews represent for us also extraordinarily malignant\r\n    gluttons. We have now approximately 2,500,000 of them in the\r\n    General Government, perhaps with the Jewish mixtures and\r\n    everything that goes with it, 3,500,000 Jews. We cannot shoot or\r\n    poison those 3,500,000 Jews, but we shall nevertheless be able\r\n    to take measures, which will lead, somehow, to their\r\n    annihilation, and this in connection with the gigantic measures\r\n    to be determined in discussions from the Reich. The General\r\n    Government must become free of Jews, the same as the Reich.\r\n    Where and how this is to be achieved is a matter for the offices\r\n    which we must appoint and create here. Their activities will be\r\n    brought to your attention in due course.” (_2233-D-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis was not the planning and scheming of an irresponsible individual,\r\nbut the expression by the Governor-General of Occupied Poland, of the\r\nofficial policy of the German State.\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s notion of the means to be taken against the Jews is\r\nexpressed in a secret “Document Memorandum for the Fuehrer—Concerning:\r\nJewish Possessions in France,” dated 18 December 1941. Rosenberg urges\r\nplundering and death:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In compliance with the order of the Fuehrer for\r\n    protection of Jewish cultural possessions, a great number of\r\n    Jewish dwellings remained unguarded. Consequently, many\r\n    furnishings have disappeared because a guard could, naturally,\r\n    not be posted. In the whole East the administration has found\r\n    terrible conditions of living quarters, and the chances of\r\n    procurement are so limited that it is not practical to procure\r\n    any more. Therefore, I beg the Fuehrer to permit the seizure of\r\n    all Jewish home furnishings of Jews in Paris, who have fled or\r\n    will leave shortly, and that of Jews living in all parts of the\r\n    occupied West, to relieve the shortage of furnishings in the\r\n    administration in the East.\r\n\r\n    “2. A great number of leading Jews were, after a short\r\n    examination in Paris, again released. The attempts on the lives\r\n    of members of the armed forces have not stopped; on the contrary\r\n    they continue. This reveals an unmistakable plan to disrupt the\r\n    German-French cooperation, to force Germany to retaliate, and,\r\n    with this, evoke a new defense on the part of the French against\r\n    Germany. I suggest to the Fuehrer that, instead of executing 100\r\n    Frenchmen, we substitute 100 Jewish bankers, lawyers, etc. It is\r\n    the Jews in London and New York who incite the French communists\r\n    to commit acts of violence, and it seems only fair that the\r\n    members of this race should pay for this. It is not the little\r\n    Jews, but the leading Jews in France, who should be held\r\n    responsible. That would tend to awaken the Anti-Jewish\r\n    sentiment.\r\n\r\n                             “(Signed)  A. Rosenberg.”  (_001-PS_)\r\n\r\n(1) _Starvation._ Chief among the methods utilized for the annihilation\r\nof the Jewish people was starvation. Policies were designed and adopted\r\nto deprive the Jews of the most elemental necessities of life. Hans\r\nFrank, then Governor-General of Poland, wrote in his diary that hunger\r\nrations were introduced in the Warsaw Ghetto (_2233-E-PS_). Referring to\r\nthe new food regulations of August 1942, he noted that by these food\r\nregulations more than one million Jews were virtually condemned to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n    “That we sentence 1,200,000 Jews to die of hunger should be\r\n    noted only marginally. It is a matter of course that should the\r\n    Jews not starve to death it would we hope result in a speeding\r\n    up of the anti-Jewish measures.” (_2233-E-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the deliberate policy of Jewish starvation, Jews were\r\nprohibited from pursuing agricultural activities in order to cut them\r\noff from access to sources of food. A document entitled “Provisional\r\nDirectives on the Treatment of Jews”, issued by the Reichscommissar for\r\nthe Ostland, provided:\r\n\r\n    “Jews must be cleaned out from the countryside. The Jews are to\r\n    be removed from all trades, especially from trade with\r\n    agricultural products and other foodstuffs.” (_1138-PS_)\r\n\r\nJews were also excluded from the purchase of basic food, such as wheat\r\nproducts, meat, eggs, and milk. A decree dated 18 September 1942, from\r\nthe Ministry of Agriculture, provided:\r\n\r\n    “Jews will no longer receive the following foods, beginning with\r\n    the 42nd distribution period (19 October 1942): meat, meat\r\n    products, eggs, wheat products (cake, white bread, wheat rolls,\r\n    wheat flour, etc.) whole milk, fresh skimmed milk, as well as\r\n    such food distributed not on food ration cards issued uniformly\r\n    throughout the Reich but on local supply certificates or by\r\n    special announcement of the nutrition office on extra coupons of\r\n    the food cards. Jewish children and young people over ten years\r\n    of age will receive the bread ration of the normal consumer.”\r\n    (_1347-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe sick, the old, and pregnant mothers were excluded from the special\r\nfood concessions allotted to non-Jews. Seizure by the State Police of\r\nfood shipments to Jews from abroad was authorized, and Jewish ration\r\ncards were distinctly marked with the word “Jew” in color across the\r\nface of the cards, so that the store-keepers could readily identify and\r\ndiscriminate against Jewish purchasers.\r\n\r\nAccording to page 110 of an official document of the Czechoslovakian\r\ngovernment published in 1943 and entitled “Czechoslovakia Fights Back,”\r\nJewish food purchases were confined to certain areas, to certain days,\r\nand to certain hours. As might be expected, the period permitted for the\r\npurchases occurred during the time when food stocks were likely to be\r\nexhausted. (_1689-PS_)\r\n\r\nBy Special Order No. 44 for the Eastern Occupied Territories, dated 4\r\nNovember 1941, Jews were limited to rations as low as only one-half of\r\nthe lowest basic category of other people, and the Ministry of\r\nAgriculture was empowered to exclude Jews entirely or partially from\r\nobtaining food thus exposing the Jewish community to death by\r\nstarvation. A bulletin issued by the Polish Ministry of Information,\r\ndated 15 December 1942, concludes that upon the basis of the nature of\r\nthe separate rationing and the amount of food available to Jews in the\r\nWarsaw and Cracow ghettos, the system was designed to bring about\r\nstarvation:\r\n\r\n    “In regard to food supplies they are brought under a completely\r\n    separate system, which is obviously aimed at depriving them of\r\n    the most elemental necessities of life.” (_L-165_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Annihilation._ Annihilation within the ghettos is illustrated and\r\nglorified in the report of Major General of the Police Stroop, entitled\r\n“The Warsaw Ghetto is No More.” (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis report bound in leather profusely illustrated, typed on heavy bond\r\npaper, and almost 75 pages in length, is the almost unbelievable recital\r\nof a proud accomplishment by Stroop, who signed the report with a bold\r\nhand. Stroop in his report first pays tribute to the bravery and heroism\r\nof the German forces who participated in the ruthless actions against a\r\ndefenseless group of Jews numbering, to be exact 56,065—including\r\ninfants and women. His report relates day-by-day progress in the\r\naccomplishment of his mission—to destroy and to obliterate the Warsaw\r\nGhetto. According to this report, the ghetto, which was established in\r\nWarsaw in November 1940, was inhabited by about 400,000 Jews; and prior\r\nto the action for the destruction of this Ghetto, some 316,000 had\r\nalready been deported.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the boastful and vivid account’s of the scenes within\r\nthe Warsaw Ghetto:\r\n\r\n    “The resistance put up by the Jews and bandits could be broken\r\n    only by relentlessly using all our forces and energy by day and\r\n    night. On 23 April 1943 the Reichsfuehrer SS issued through the\r\n    Higher SS and Police Fuehrer East at Cracow his order to\r\n    complete the combing out of the Warsaw Ghetto with the greatest\r\n    severity and relentless tenacity. I therefore decided to destroy\r\n    the entire Jewish residential area by setting every block on\r\n    fire, including the blocks of residential buildings near the\r\n    armament works. One concern after the other was systematically\r\n    evacuated and subsequently destroyed by fire. The Jews then\r\n    emerged from their hiding places and dugouts in almost every\r\n    case. Not infrequently, the Jews stayed in the burning buildings\r\n    until, because of the heat and the fear of being burned alive,\r\n    they preferred to jump down from the upper stories after having\r\n    thrown mattresses and other upholstered articles into the street\r\n    from the burning buildings. With their bones broken, they still\r\n    tried to crawl across the street into blocks of buildings which\r\n    had not yet been set on fire or were only partially in flames.\r\n    Often the Jews changed their hiding places during the night, by\r\n    moving into the ruins of burnt-out buildings, taking refuge\r\n    there until they were found by our patrols. Their stay in the\r\n    sewers also ceased to be pleasant after the first week.\r\n    Frequently from the street, we could hear loud voices coming\r\n    through the sewer shafts. Then the men of the Waffen SS, the\r\n    Police or the _Wehrmacht_ Engineers courageously climbed down\r\n    from the shafts to bring out the Jews and not infrequently they\r\n    then stumbled over Jews already dead, or were shot at. It was\r\n    always necessary to use smoke candles to drive out the Jews.\r\n    Thus one day we opened 183 sewer entrance holes, and at a fixed\r\n    time lowered smoke candles into them, with the result that the\r\n    bandits fled from what they believed to be gas in the center of\r\n    the former Ghetto, where they could then be pulled out of the\r\n    sewer holes there. A great number of Jews who could not be\r\n    counted were exterminated by blowing up sewers and dugouts.\r\n\r\n    “The longer the resistance lasted the tougher the men of the\r\n    Waffen SS, Police, and _Wehrmacht_ became. They fulfilled their\r\n    duty indefatigably in faithful comradeship, and stood together\r\n    as models and examples of soldiers. Their duty hours often\r\n    lasted from early morning until late at night. At night search\r\n    patrols with rags wound round their feet remained at the heels\r\n    of the Jews and gave them no respite. Not infrequently they\r\n    caught and killed Jews who used the night hours for\r\n    supplementing their stores from abandoned dugouts and for\r\n    contacting neighboring groups or exchanging news with them.\r\n\r\n    “Considering that the greater part of the men of the Waffen SS\r\n    had only been trained for three to four weeks before being\r\n    assigned to this action, high credit should be given to the\r\n    pluck, courage and devotion to duty which they showed. It must\r\n    be stated that the _Wehrmacht_ Engineers, too, executed the\r\n    blowing up of dugouts, sewers and concrete buildings with\r\n    indefatigability and great devotion to duty. Officers and men of\r\n    the police, a large part of whom had already been at the front,\r\n    again excelled by their dashing spirit.\r\n\r\n    “Only through the continuous and untiring work of all involved\r\n    did we succeed in catching a total of 56,065 Jews whose\r\n    extermination can be proved. To this should be added the number\r\n    of Jews who lost their lives in explosions or fires, but whose\r\n    number could not be ascertained.” (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his report Stroop lists the losses of German troops:\r\n\r\n    “For the Fuehrer and their country the following fell in the\r\n    battle for the destruction of Jews and bandits in the former\r\n    ghetto of Warsaw * * *” [Fifteen names are thereafter listed].\r\n\r\n    “Furthermore, the Polish police sergeant Julian Zielinski, born\r\n    13 November 1891, 8th Commissariat, fell on 19 April 1943 while\r\n    fulfilling his duty. They gave their utmost, their life. We\r\n    shall never forget them.\r\n\r\n    “The following were wounded * * *” [There follow the names of 60\r\n    Waffen SS personnel] “11 watchmen from training camps, probably\r\n    Lithuanians; 12 Security Police officers in SS units; 5 men of\r\n    the Polish Police; and 2 regular army personnel, engineers.”\r\n    (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe story continues in the daily teletype reports, from which the\r\nfollowing are excerpts:\r\n\r\n    “Our setting the block on fire achieved the result in the course\r\n    of the night that those Jews whom we had not been able to find\r\n    despite all our search operations left their hideouts under the\r\n    roofs, in the cellars, and elsewhere, and appeared on the\r\n    outside of the buildings, trying to escape the flames. Masses of\r\n    them—entire families—were already aflame and jumped from the\r\n    windows or endeavored to let themselves down by means of sheets\r\n    tied together or the like. Steps had been taken so that these\r\n    Jews as well as the remaining ones were liquidated at once.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “When the blocks of buildings mentioned above were destroyed,\r\n    120 Jews were caught and numerous Jews were destroyed when they\r\n    jumped from the attics to the inner courtyards, trying to escape\r\n    the flames. Many more Jews perished in the flames or were\r\n    destroyed when the dugouts and sewer entrances were blown up.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Not until the blocks of buildings were well aflame and were\r\n    about to collapse did a further considerable number of Jews\r\n    emerge, forced to do so by the flames and the smoke. Time and\r\n    again the Jews try to escape even through burning buildings.\r\n    Innumerable Jews whom we saw on the roofs during the\r\n    conflagration perished in the flames. Others emerged from the\r\n    upper stories in the last possible moment and were only able to\r\n    escape death from the flames by jumping down. Today we caught a\r\n    total of 2,283 Jews, of whom 204 were shot, and innumerable Jews\r\n    were destroyed in dugouts and in the flames.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Jews testify that they emerge at night to get fresh air,\r\n    since it is unbearable to stay permanently within the dugouts\r\n    owing to the long duration of the operation. On the average the\r\n    raiding parties shoot 30 to 50 Jews each night. From these\r\n    statements it was to be inferred that a considerable number of\r\n    Jews are still underground in the Ghetto. Today we blew up a\r\n    concrete building which we had not been able to destroy by fire.\r\n    In this operation we learned that the blowing up of a building\r\n    is a very lengthy process and takes an enormous amount of\r\n    explosives. The best and only method for destroying the Jews\r\n    therefore still remains the setting of fires.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Some depositions speak of three to four thousand Jews who still\r\n    remain in underground holes, sewers, and dugouts; The\r\n    undersigned is resolved not to terminate the large-scale\r\n    operation until the last Jew has been destroyed.” (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe teletype message of 15 May 1945 indicates that the operation is in\r\nits last stage:\r\n\r\n    “A special unit once more searched the last block of buildings\r\n    which was still intact in the Ghetto, and subsequently destroyed\r\n    it. In the evening the chapel, mortuary, and all other buildings\r\n    in the Jewish cemetery were blown up or destroyed by fire.”\r\n    (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 24 May 1943 the final figures were compiled by Major General Stroop:\r\n\r\n    “Of the total of 56,065 caught, about 7,000 were destroyed in\r\n    the former Ghetto during large-scale operation. 6,929 Jews were\r\n    destroyed by transporting them to T.II [believed to be Treblinka\r\n    Camp No. 2]. The sum total of Jews destroyed is therefore\r\n    13,929. Beyond the number of 56,065 an estimated number of 5 to\r\n    6,000 Jews were destroyed by being blown up or by perishing in\r\n    the flames.” (_1061-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt was not always necessary, or perhaps desirable, to place the Jews\r\nwithin Ghettos to effect elimination. In the Baltic States a more direct\r\ncourse of action was followed. According to a report by SS Brigade\r\nFuehrer Stahlecker to Himmler, dated 15 October 1941, entitled “Action\r\nGroup A,” which was found in Himmler’s private files, 135,567 persons,\r\nnearly all Jews, were murdered in accordance to basic orders directing\r\nthe complete annihilation of Jews. SS Brigade Fuehrer Stahlecker\r\ncontinues his report:\r\n\r\n    “* * * To our surprise it was not easy at first to set in motion\r\n    an extensive pogrom against the Jews. Klimatis, the leader of\r\n    the partisan unit, mentioned above, who was used for this\r\n    purpose primarily, succeeded in starting a pogrom on the basis\r\n    of advice given to him by a small advanced detachment acting in\r\n    Kowno and in such a way that no German order or German\r\n    instigation was noticed from the outside. During the first\r\n    pogrom in the night from 25 to 26 June the Lithuanian partisans\r\n    did away with more than 1,500 Jews, setting fire to several\r\n    synagogues or destroying them by other means and burning down a\r\n    Jewish dwelling district consisting of about 60 houses. During\r\n    the following nights about 2,300 Jews were made harmless in a\r\n    similar way. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It was possible, though, through similar influences on the\r\n    Latvian auxiliary to set in motion a pogrom against the Jews\r\n    also in Riga. During this pogrom all synagogues were destroyed\r\n    and about 400 Jews were killed.” (_L-180_)\r\n\r\nNazi ingenuity reached its zenith with the construction and operation of\r\nthe gas van as a means of mass annihilation of the Jews. A description\r\nof the operation of these vehicles of death is fully set forth in a\r\ncaptured Top Secret document dated 16 May 1942, addressed to SS\r\nObersturmbannfuehrer Rauff, 8 Prince Albrecht-Strasse, Berlin, from Dr.\r\nBecker, SS Untersturmfuehrer. The report reads in part:\r\n\r\n    “The overhauling of vans by groups D and C is finished. While\r\n    the vans of the first series can also be put into action if the\r\n    weather is not too bad, the vans of the second series (_Saurer_)\r\n    stop completely in rainy weather. If it has rained for instance\r\n    for only one half hour, the van cannot be used because it simply\r\n    skids away. It can only be used in absolutely dry weather. It is\r\n    only a question now whether the van can only be used standing at\r\n    the place of execution. First the van has to be brought to that\r\n    place, which is possible only in good weather. The place of\r\n    execution is usually 10 to 15 km away from the highways and is\r\n    difficult of access because of its location; in damp or wet\r\n    weather it is not accessible at all. If the persons to be\r\n    executed are driven or led to that place, then they realize\r\n    immediately what is going on and get restless, which is to be\r\n    avoided as far as possible. There is only one way left; to load\r\n    them at the collecting point and to drive them to the spot.\r\n\r\n    “I ordered the vans of group D to be camouflaged as\r\n    house-trailers by putting one set of window shutters on each\r\n    side of the small van and two on each side of the larger vans,\r\n    such as one often sees on farm houses in the country. The vans\r\n    became so well-known, that not only the authorities but also the\r\n    civilian population called the van ‘death van’, as soon as one\r\n    of these vehicles appeared. It is my opinion the van cannot be\r\n    kept secret for any length of time, not even camouflaged.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Because of the rough terrain and the indescribable road and\r\n    highway conditions the caulkings and rivets loosen in the course\r\n    of time. I was asked if in such cases the vans should be brought\r\n    to Berlin for repair. Transportation to Berlin would be much too\r\n    expensive and would demand too much fuel. In order to save those\r\n    expenses I ordered them to have smaller leaks soldered and if\r\n    that should no longer be possible, to notify Berlin immediately\r\n    by radio, that Pol. Nr. is out of order. Besides that I ordered\r\n    that during application of gas all the men were to be kept as\r\n    far away from the vans as possible, so they should not suffer\r\n    damage to their health by the gas which eventually would escape.\r\n    I should like to take this opportunity to bring the following to\r\n    your attention: several commands have had the unloading after\r\n    the application of gas done by their own men. I brought to the\r\n    attention of the commanders of those S.K. concerned the immense\r\n    psychological injuries and damages to their health which that\r\n    work can have for those men, even if not immediately, at least\r\n    later on. The men complained to me about headaches which\r\n    appeared after each unloading. Nevertheless they don’t want to\r\n    change the orders, because they are afraid prisoners called for\r\n    that work, could use an opportune moment to flee. To protect the\r\n    men from those damages, I request orders be issued accordingly.\r\n\r\n    “The application of gas usually is not undertaken correctly. In\r\n    order to come to an end as fast as possible, the driver presses\r\n    the accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing that the persons\r\n    to be executed suffer death from suffocation and not death by\r\n    dozing off as was planned. My directions now have proved that by\r\n    correct adjustment of the levers death comes faster and the\r\n    prisoners fall asleep peacefully. Distorted faces and\r\n    excretions, such as could be seen before, are no longer noticed.\r\n\r\n    “Today I shall continue my journey to group B, where I can be\r\n    reached with further news.\r\n\r\n    “Signed: Dr. Becker, SS Untersturmfuehrer.”  (_501-PS_)\r\n\r\nA letter signed by Hauptsturmfuehrer Truehe on the subject of S-vans,\r\naddressed to the Reich Security Main Office, Room 2-D-3-A, Berlin, and\r\nmarked “Top Secret,” establishes that the vans were used for the\r\nannihilation of the Jews. The message reads:\r\n\r\n    “A transport of Jews, which has to be treated in a special way,\r\n    arrives weekly at the office of the commandant of the Security\r\n    Police and the Security Service of White Ruthenia.\r\n\r\n    “The three S-vans which are there are not sufficient for that\r\n    purpose. I request assignment of another S-van (five tons). At\r\n    the same time I request the shipment of twenty gas hoses for the\r\n    three S-vans on hand (two Diamond, one Saurer), since the ones\r\n    on hand are leaky already.\r\n\r\n    (signed) The Commandant of the Security Police and the Security\r\n    Service, Ostland.” (_501-PS_)\r\n\r\nIt appears that a certain amount of discord existed between officials of\r\nthe German government as to the proper means and methods to be used in\r\nconnection with the extermination program. A secret report dated 18 June\r\n1943, addressed to Rosenberg, complained that five thousand Jews killed\r\nby the police and SS might have been used for forced labor, and chided\r\nthem for failing to bury the bodies of those liquidated:\r\n\r\n    “The fact that Jews receive special treatment requires no\r\n    further discussion. However, it appears hardly believable that\r\n    this is done in the way described in the report of the General\r\n    Commissioner of 1 June 1943. What is Katyn against that? Imagine\r\n    only that these occurrences would become known to the other side\r\n    and exploited by them! Most likely such propaganda would have no\r\n    effect only because people who hear and read about it simply\r\n    would not be ready to believe it.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “To lock men, women, and children into barns and to set fire to\r\n    them does not appear to be a suitable method of combatting\r\n    bands, even if it is desired to exterminate the population. This\r\n    method is not worthy of the German cause and hurts our\r\n    reputation severely.” (_R-135_)\r\n\r\nGunther, the prison warden at Minsk, in a letter dated 31 May 1943,\r\naddressed to the General Commissioner for White Ruthenia, was critical\r\nby implication. This letter, entitled, “Action Against Jews,” reads:\r\n\r\n    “On 13 April 1943 the former German dentist Ernst Israel\r\n    Tichauer and his wife, Elisa Sara Tichauer, nee Rosenthal, were\r\n    committed to the court prison by the Security Service. Since\r\n    that time all German and Russian Jews who were turned over to us\r\n    had their golden bridgework, crowns, and fillings pulled or\r\n    broken out. This happens always one to two hours before the\r\n    respective action.\r\n\r\n    “Since 13 April 1943, 516 German and Russian Jews have been\r\n    finished off. On the basis of a definite investigation gold was\r\n    taken only in two actions—on 14 April 1943 from 172, and on 27\r\n    April 1943 from 164 Jews. About fifty percent of the Jews had\r\n    gold teeth, bridgework, or fillings. _Hauptscharfuehrer_ Rube of\r\n    the Security Service was always personally present and he took\r\n    the gold along, too.\r\n\r\n    “Before 13 April 1943 this was not done.\r\n\r\n    (signed)  Gunther, Prison Warden.” (_R-135_)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing letter was forwarded to Rosenberg, as Reich Minister for\r\nthe Occupied Eastern Territories, on June 1943. The covering letter to\r\nRosenberg reads:\r\n\r\n    “The enclosed official report from the warden of the prison in\r\n    Minsk is submitted to the Reich Minister and the Reich Commissar\r\n    for Information.\r\n\r\n    “(signed)  The General Commissar in Minsk.”  (_R-135_)\r\n\r\nA further complaint is contained in a secret letter addressed to General\r\nof Infantry, Thomas, Chief of the International Armament Department,\r\ndated 2 December 1941 (_3257-PS_). The writer of this letter\r\napprehensively stated his reason for not forwarding the communication\r\nthrough official channels:\r\n\r\n    “For the personal information of the Chief of the Industrial\r\n    Armament Department I am forwarding a total account of the\r\n    present situation in the Reichskommissariat Ukraine in which the\r\n    difficulties and tensions encountered so far and the problems\r\n    which give rise to serious anxiety are stated with unmistakable\r\n    clarity.\r\n\r\n    “Intentionally I have desisted from submitting such a report\r\n    through official channels or to make it known to other\r\n    departments interested in it because I do not expect any results\r\n    that way, but to the contrary am apprehensive that the\r\n    difficulties and tensions and also the divergent opinions might\r\n    only be increased due to the peculiarity of the situation.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Jewish problem:\r\n\r\n    “Regulation of the Jewish question in the Ukraine was a\r\n    difficult problem because the Jews constituted a large part of\r\n    the urban population. We therefore have to deal—just as in the\r\n    General Government—with a mass problem of policy concerning the\r\n    population. Many cities had a percentage of Jews exceeding fifty\r\n    percent. Only the rich Jews had fled from the German troops. The\r\n    majority of Jews remained under German administration. The\r\n    latter found the problem more complicated through the fact that\r\n    these Jews represented almost the entire trade and even a part\r\n    of the manpower in small and medium industries besides the\r\n    business which had in part become superfluous as a direct or\r\n    indirect result of the war. The elimination therefore\r\n    necessarily had far-reaching economic consequences and even\r\n    direct consequences for the armament industry (production for\r\n    supplying the troops).”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The attitude of the Jewish population was anxious—obliging\r\n    from the beginning. They tried to avoid everything that might\r\n    displease the German administration. That they hated the German\r\n    administration and army inwardly goes without saying and cannot\r\n    be surprising. However, there is no proof that Jewry as a whole\r\n    or even to a greater part was implicated in acts of sabotage.\r\n    Surely there were some terrorists or saboteurs among them just\r\n    as among the Ukrainians. But it cannot be said that the Jews as\r\n    such represented a danger to the German armed forces. The output\r\n    produced by Jews who, of course, were prompted by nothing but\r\n    the feeling of fear, was satisfactory to the troops and the\r\n    German administration.\r\n\r\n    “The Jewish population remained temporarily unmolested shortly\r\n    after the fighting. Only weeks, sometimes months later,\r\n    specially detached formations of the police executed a planned\r\n    shooting of Jews. The action as a rule proceeded from east to\r\n    west. It was done entirely in public with the use of the\r\n    Ukrainian militia, and unfortunately in many instances also with\r\n    members of the armed forces taking part voluntarily. The way\r\n    these actions, which included men and old men, women, and\r\n    children of all ages were carried out was horrible. The great\r\n    masses executed make this action more gigantic than any similar\r\n    measure taken so far in the Soviet Union. So far about 150,000\r\n    to 200,000 Jews may have been executed in the part of the\r\n    Ukraine belonging to the Reichskommissariat; no consideration\r\n    was given to the interests of economy.\r\n\r\n    “Summarizing, it can be said that the kind of solution of the\r\n    Jewish problem applied in the Ukraine which obviously was based\r\n    on the ideological theories as a matter of principle had the\r\n    following results:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Elimination of a part of partly superfluous eaters in the\r\n    cities.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Elimination of a part of the population which hated us\r\n    undoubtedly.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) Elimination of badly needed tradesmen who were in many\r\n    instances indispensable even in the interests of the armed\r\n    forces.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) Consequences as to foreign policy—propaganda which are\r\n    obvious.\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) Bad effects on the troops which in any case get indirect\r\n    contact with the executions.\r\n\r\n    “(_f_) Brutalizing effect on the formations which carry out the\r\n    execution—regular police.” (_3257-PS_)\r\n\r\nLest it be thought that these conditions existed only in the East, the\r\nofficial Netherlands government report by the Commissioner for\r\nRepatriation as relates similar treatment of the Jews in the West\r\n(_1726-PS_). The German measures taken against the Dutch\r\nJews—discriminatory decrees, anti-semitic demonstrations, burning of\r\nsynagogues, purging of Jews from the economic life of their country,\r\nfood restrictions, forced labor, concentration camp confinement,\r\ndeportation, and death—all these measures follow the same pattern that\r\nwas effected throughout Nazi-occupied Europe. The official Netherlands\r\nreport states that full Jews, liable to deportation, numbered 140,000.\r\nThe total number of actual Jewish deportees was 117,000, representing\r\nmore than eighty-three per cent of all the Jews in the Netherlands. Of\r\nthese, 115,000 were deported to Poland for slave labor, and after\r\ndeparture all trace of them was lost. Regardless of victory or defeat to\r\nGermany, the Jew was doomed. It was the expressed intent of the Nazi\r\nstate that whatever the German fate might be the Jew would not survive.\r\n(_1726-PS_)\r\n\r\nA Top Secret message from the commandant of the SIPO and SD for the\r\nRadom District, addressed to SS Hauptsturmfuehrer Thiel on the subject,\r\n“Clearance of Prisons,” reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I again stress the fact that the number of inmates of the SIPO\r\n    and SD prisons must be kept as low as possible. In the present\r\n    situation, particularly, those suspects handed over by the civil\r\n    police need only be subjected to a short, formal interrogation,\r\n    provided there are no serious grounds for suspicion. They are\r\n    then to be sent by the quickest route to a concentration camp,\r\n    should no court-martial proceeding be necessary or should there\r\n    be no question of discharge. Please keep the number of\r\n    discharges very low. Should the situation at the front\r\n    necessitate it, early preparations are to be made for the total\r\n    clearance of prisons. Should the situation develop suddenly in\r\n    such a way that it is impossible to evacuate the prisoners, the\r\n    prison inmates are to be liquidated and their bodies disposed of\r\n    as far as possible (burning, blowing up the building, etc.). If\r\n    necessary, Jews still employed in the armament industry or on\r\n    other work are to be dealt with in the same way.\r\n\r\n    “The liberation of prisoners or Jews by the enemy, be it the WB\r\n    [perhaps means ‘West-Bund,’ or ‘Western Ally’] or the Red Army,\r\n    must be avoided under all circumstances, nor may they fall into\r\n    their hands alive.” (_L-53_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Mass Disposal of Jews in Concentration Camps._ The concentration\r\ncamps were utilized to dispose of literally millions of Jews, who died\r\nby mass shooting, gas, poison, starvation, and other means. The part\r\nwhich the concentration camps played in the annihilation of the Jewish\r\npeople is indicated in an official Polish report on Auschwitz\r\nConcentration Camp (_L-161_). In Auschwitz during July 1944 Jews were\r\nkilled at the rate of 12,000 daily:\r\n\r\n    “* * * During July 1944, they were being liquidated at the rate\r\n    of 12,000 Hungarian Jews daily, and as the crematory could not\r\n    deal with such numbers, many bodies were thrown into large pits\r\n    and covered with quick lime.” (_L-161_)\r\n\r\nThe official Polish Government Commission Report on the Investigation of\r\nGerman crimes in Poland describes the concentration camp at Treblinka in\r\nthese terms:\r\n\r\n    “* * * In March 1942, the Germans began to erect another camp,\r\n    Treblinka B, in the neighborhood of Treblinka A, intended to\r\n    become a place of torment for Jews.\r\n\r\n    “The erection of this camp was closely connected with the German\r\n    plans aiming at a complete destruction of the Jewish population\r\n    in Poland which necessitated the creation of a machinery by\r\n    means of which the Polish Jews could be killed in large numbers.\r\n    Late in April 1942, the erection of the first three chambers was\r\n    finished in which these general massacres were to be performed\r\n    by means of steam. Somewhat later the erection of the real death\r\n    building was finished, which contains ten death chambers. It was\r\n    opened for wholesale murders early in autumn 1942 * * *.”\r\n    (_3311-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report of the Polish commission describes graphically the procedure\r\nfor extermination within the camp:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The average number of Jews dealt with at the camp in\r\n    summer 1942 was about two railway transports daily, but there\r\n    were days of much higher efficiency. From autumn 1942 this\r\n    number was falling.\r\n\r\n    “After unloading in the siding all victims were assembled in one\r\n    place where men were separated from women and children. In the\r\n    first days of the existence of the camp the victims were made to\r\n    believe that after a short stay in the camp, necessary for\r\n    bathing and disinfection, they would be sent farther east, for\r\n    work. Explanations of this sort were given by SS men who\r\n    assisted at the unloading of the transports and further\r\n    explanations could be read in notices stuck up on the walls of\r\n    the barracks. But later, when more transports had to be dealt\r\n    with, the Germans dropped all pretenses and only tried to\r\n    accelerate the procedure.\r\n\r\n    “All victims had to strip off their clothes and shoes, which\r\n    were collected afterwards, whereupon all victims, women and\r\n    children first, were driven into the death chambers. Those too\r\n    slow or too weak to move quickly were driven on by rifle-butts,\r\n    by whipping and kicking, often by Sauer himself. Many slipped\r\n    and fell, the next victims pressed forward and stumbled over\r\n    them. Small children were simply thrown inside. After being\r\n    filled up to capacity the chambers were hermetically closed and\r\n    steam was let in. In a few minutes all was over. The Jewish\r\n    menial workers had to remove the bodies from the platform and to\r\n    bury them in mass graves. By and by, as new transports arrived,\r\n    the cemetery grew, extending in eastern direction.\r\n\r\n    “From reports received, it may be assumed that several hundred\r\n    thousands of Jews have been exterminated in Treblinka.”\r\n    (_3311-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn official United States government report issued by the Executive\r\nOffice of the President of the United States, War Refugee Board, on the\r\nGerman camps at Auschwitz and Birkenau, sets forth the number of Jews\r\ngassed in Birkenau in the two-year period between April 1942 and April\r\n1944. The figure printed in this report is not a typographical error.\r\nThe number is 1,765,000. (_L-22_)\r\n\r\n                5. RESULTS OF THE EXTERMINATION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe huge scale of the Jewish eliminations is also reflected in the\r\nbookkeeping and statistics of the Germans themselves. The 16 December\r\n1941 entry in the diary of Hans Frank contains these figures:\r\n\r\n    “The Jews for us also represent extraordinarily malignant\r\n    gluttons.\r\n\r\n    “We have now approximately 2,500,000 of them in General\r\n    Government—perhaps with the Jewish mixtures, and everything\r\n    that goes with it, 3,500,000 Jews.” (_2233-D-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 25 January 1944, three years and one month later, Frank wrote in his\r\ndiary these words:\r\n\r\n    “At the present time we still have in the General Government\r\n    perhaps 100,000 Jews.” (_2233-F-PS_)\r\n\r\nThus, in this period of three years, according to the records of the\r\nthen Governor-General of Occupied Poland, between 2,400,000 and\r\n3,400,000 Jews had been eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Jews who died by Nazi hands can never be definitely\r\nascertained. It is known, however, that 4 million Jews died in\r\nconcentration camps, and that 2 million Jews were killed by the State\r\nPolice in the East, making a total of 6 million murdered Jews. The\r\nsource of these figures is Adolph Eichmann, Chief of the Jewish Section\r\nof the Gestapo. The figures are contained in an affidavit made by Dr.\r\nWilhelm Hoettl, Deputy Group Leader of the Foreign Section of the\r\nSecurity Section, AMT VI, of the RSHA. Hoettl, in his affidavit, states\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “Approximately 4 million Jews had been killed in the various\r\n    concentration camps, while an additional 2 million met death in\r\n    other ways, the major part of which were shot by operational\r\n    squads of the Security Police during the campaign against\r\n    Russia.” (_2738-PS_)\r\n\r\nHoettl describes the source of his information as follows:\r\n\r\n    “According to my knowledge, Eichmann was at that time the leader\r\n    of the Jewish Section of the Gestapo, and in addition to that he\r\n    had been ordered by Himmler to get a hold of the Jews in all the\r\n    European countries and to transport them to Germany. Eichmann\r\n    was then very much impressed with the fact that Rumania had\r\n    withdrawn from the war in those days. Moreover, he had come to\r\n    me to get information about the military situation which I\r\n    received daily from the Hungarian Ministry of War and from the\r\n    Commander of the Waffen-SS in Hungary. He expressed his\r\n    conviction that Germany had now lost the war and that he\r\n    personally had no further chance. He knew that he would be\r\n    considered one of the main war criminals by the United Nations,\r\n    since he had millions of Jewish lives on his conscience. I asked\r\n    him how many that was, to which he answered that although the\r\n    number was a great Reich secret, he would tell me since I, as a\r\n    historian, would be interested, and that he would probably not\r\n    return anyhow from his command in Rumania. He had, shortly\r\n    before that, made a report to Himmler, as the latter wanted to\r\n    know the exact number of Jews who had been killed.” (_2738-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE PERSECUTION OF\r\n                                THE JEWS\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (b, c).           │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections IV (D) 3│      │\r\n                │  (d); X (B).                           │  I   │  20, 55\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n  3737-PS       │Hague Convention of 1907 respecting the │      │\r\n                │  Laws and Customs of War on Land,      │      │\r\n                │  Annex, Article 46.                    │  VI  │     597\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

Plans to Germanize meant\r\nplans to assimilate conquered territories politically, culturally,\r\nsocially, and economically into the German Reich. Germanization meant\r\nthe obliteration of the former national character of the conquered\r\nterritories and the extermination of all elements which could not be\r\nreconciled with the Nazi ideology. Plans for spoliation meant plans to\r\nplunder public and private property and, in general, to exploit the\r\npeople and natural resources of occupied countries.\r\n\r\n                               1. POLAND\r\n\r\nPoland was, in a sense, the testing ground for the conspirators’\r\ntheories of “lebensraum.” The four western provinces of Poland were\r\npurportedly incorporated into Germany by an order of 8 October 1939.\r\nThis order, which was signed by Hitler, Lammers, Goering, Frick, and\r\nHess, is set forth in 1939 _Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, p. 2042. These\r\nareas of Poland are frequently referred to in correspondence between the\r\nconspirators as the “incorporated Eastern territories”. The remainder of\r\nPoland which was seized by the Nazi invaders was established as the\r\nGovernment-General of Poland by an order of Hitler, dated 12 October\r\n1939. By that same order, Hans Frank was named Governor-General of the\r\nnewly-created Government-General, and Seyss-Inquart was named Deputy\r\nGovernor-General. This order is set forth in 1939 _Reichsgesetzblatt_,\r\nPart I, p. 2077.\r\n\r\nThe plans with respect to Poland, which will appear gradually from the\r\nindividual documents hereafter discussed, followed a broad pattern, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_First_: The conspirators specifically planned to exploit the people and\r\nmaterial resources of the Government-General of Poland in order to\r\nstrengthen the Nazi war machine, to impoverish the Government-General,\r\nand to reduce it to a vassal state. At a later stage, plans were\r\nformulated for creating islands of German settlements in the more\r\nfertile regions of the Government-General in order to engulf the native\r\nPolish population and accelerate the process of Germanization.\r\n\r\n_Second_: The incorporated area of Poland, which was deemed to be a part\r\nof the German Reich, was to be ruthlessly Germanized. To that end, the\r\nconspirators planned:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To permit the retention of the productive facilities in the\r\nincorporated area, all of which were to be dedicated to the Nazi war\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n(_b_) They planned to deport to the Government-General many hundreds of\r\nthousands of Jews, members of the Polish intelligentsia, and other\r\nnoncompliant elements. The Jews deported to the Government-General were\r\ndoomed to speedy annihilation. Moreover, since the conspirators felt\r\nthat members of the Polish intelligentsia could not be Germanized and\r\nmight serve as a center of resistance against their “new order”, they\r\ntoo were to be eliminated.\r\n\r\n(_c_) They planned to deport all able-bodied Polish workers to Germany\r\nfor work in the Nazi war machine. This was to serve the twofold purpose\r\nof helping to satisfy the labor requirements of the Nazi war machine and\r\npreventing the propagation of a new generation of Poles.\r\n\r\n(_d_) They planned to mold all persons in the incorporated area who were\r\ndeemed to possess German blood, into German subjects who would\r\nreligiously adhere to the principles of National Socialism. To that end,\r\nthe conspirators set up an elaborate racial register. Those who resisted\r\nor refused to cooperate in this program were sent to concentration\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\n(_e_) They planned to bring thousands of German subjects into the\r\nincorporated area for purposes of settlement.\r\n\r\n(_f_) They planned to confiscate the property—particularly the\r\nfarms—of the Poles, the Jews, and all dissident elements. The\r\nconfiscation of the property of Jews was part of the conspirators’\r\nlarger program of extermination of the Jews. Confiscation likewise\r\nserved three additional purposes: (1) it provided land for the new\r\nGerman settlers and enabled the conspirators to reward their adherents;\r\n(2) dispossessed Polish property owners could be shipped to Germany for\r\nwork in the production of implements of war; and (3) the separation of\r\nPolish farmers from their wives furthered the plan to prevent the growth\r\nof a new generation of Poles.\r\n\r\nThese plans are developed in the specific documents which follow.\r\n\r\nA. _The Program in the Incorporated Area._\r\n\r\n(1) _Economic Spoliation._ A report of an interview with Frank on 3\r\nOctober 1939, which was included in a large report prepared in the OKW\r\nby one Captain Varain at the direction of General Thomas, then Chief of\r\nthe Military Economic Staff of the OKW, states:\r\n\r\n    “In the first interview which the chief of the Central Division\r\n    and the liaison officer between the Armament Department Upper\r\n    East and the Chief Administrative Officer (subsequently called\r\n    Governor-General) had with Minister Frank on October 3, 1939 in\r\n    Posen, Frank explained the directive, and the economic and\r\n    political responsibilities which had been conferred upon him by\r\n    the Fuehrer and according to which he intended to administer\r\n    Poland. According to these directives, Poland can only be\r\n    administered by utilizing the country through means of ruthless\r\n    exploitation, deportation of all supplies, raw materials,\r\n    machines, factory installations, etc., which are important for\r\n    the German war economy, availability of all workers for work\r\n    within Germany, reduction of the entire Polish economy to\r\n    absolute minimum necessary for bare existence of the population,\r\n    closing of all educational institutions, especially technical\r\n    schools and colleges in order to prevent the growth of the new\r\n    Polish intelligentsia. ‘Poland shall be treated as a colony; the\r\n    Poles shall be the slaves of the Greater German World Empire’. *\r\n    * *\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “By destroying Polish industry, its subsequent reconstruction\r\n    after the war would become more difficult, if not impossible, so\r\n    that Poland would be reduced to its proper position as an\r\n    agrarian country which would have to depend upon Germany for\r\n    importation of industrial products.” (_EC-344-16 & 17_)\r\n\r\nThe conspirators planned a difference in treatment for the incorporated\r\narea of Poland, and for the Government-General. A directive issued and\r\nsigned by Goering on 19 October 1939, which was found among captured\r\nfiles of the OKW, stated, _inter alia_:\r\n\r\n    “In the meeting of October 13th, I have given detailed\r\n    instructions for the economical administration of the occupied\r\n    territories. I will repeat them here in short: 1. The task for\r\n    the economic treatment of the various administrative regions is\r\n    different depending on whether a country is involved which will\r\n    be incorporated politically into the German Reich or whether we\r\n    deal with the Government-General, which, in all probability,\r\n    will not be made a part of Germany.\r\n\r\n    “In the first mentioned territories the reconstruction and\r\n    expansion of the economy, the safeguarding of all their\r\n    production facilities and supplies must be aimed at, as well as\r\n    a complete incorporation into the Greater German economic system\r\n    at the earliest possible time. On the other hand, there must be\r\n    removed from the territories of the Government-General all raw\r\n    materials, scrap materials, machines etc., which are of use for\r\n    the German war economy. Enterprises which are not absolutely\r\n    necessary for the meager maintenance of the naked existence of\r\n    the population must be transferred to Germany, unless such\r\n    transfer would require an unreasonably long period of time and\r\n    would make it more practical to exploit these enterprises by\r\n    giving them German orders to be executed at their present\r\n    location.” (_EC-410_)\r\n\r\nOnce the Government-General had been stripped of its industrial\r\npotential, the conspirators planned to leave the country desolate. Not\r\neven the war damage was to be repaired. This is the clear import of an\r\norder dated 20 November 1939, issued by Hess in his capacity as Deputy\r\nFuehrer, and found in captured OKW files. Hess stated:\r\n\r\n    “I hear from Party members who came from the Government-General\r\n    that various agencies, as, for instance, the Military Economic\r\n    Staff, the Reich Ministry for Labor, etc., intend to reconstruct\r\n    certain industrial enterprises in Warsaw. However, in accordance\r\n    with a decision by Minister Dr. Frank, as approved by the\r\n    Fuehrer, Warsaw shall not be rebuilt nor is it the intention of\r\n    the Fuehrer to rebuild or reconstruct any industry in the\r\n    Government-General.” (_EC-411_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Deportation and Resettlement._ The Academy of German Law in January\r\n1940 prepared a secret report on plans for the mass migration of Poles\r\nand Jews from incorporated areas of Poland to the Government-General,\r\nand for the forcible deportation of able-bodied Poles to Germany. (The\r\ndate of the report does not appear in the English translation, but it is\r\nclearly set forth on the cover page of the original document, as January\r\n1940.) It should be recalled that the decree of 11 July 1934\r\n(_Reichsgesetzblatt_, Part I, p. 605, 11 July 1934) provided that the\r\nAcademy of German Law would be a public corporation of the Reich under\r\nthe supervision of the Reich Ministers of Justice and the Interior, and\r\nthat its task would be:\r\n\r\n    “To promote the reconstruction of German legal life, and to\r\n    realize, in constant close collaboration with the competent\r\n    legislative organizations, the National Socialist program in the\r\n    entire sphere of the law.”\r\n\r\nIt should also be stated that Frank was the president of the Academy of\r\nGerman Law during the period when this secret report was made\r\n(_2749-PS_). The report stated:\r\n\r\n    “For the carrying out of costly and long term measures for the\r\n    increase of agricultural production, the Government-General can\r\n    at the most absorb 1 to 1.5 million resettlers, as it is already\r\n    over-populated. * * * By further absorption of 1.6 million\r\n    resettlers, the 1925 Reich census figure of 133 inhabitants per\r\n    square kilometer would be reached, which practically because of\r\n    already existing rural over-population and lack of industry\r\n    would result in a double over-population.\r\n\r\n    “This figure of 1.6 million will barely suffice to transfer from\r\n    the Reich:\r\n\r\n    “The Jews from the liberated East (over 600,000), parts of the\r\n    remaining Jews, preferably the younger age groups from Germany\r\n    proper, Austria, Sudetengau and the Protectorate (altogether\r\n    over 1 million). * * *” (_661-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report then goes on to say that the following groups of people\r\nshould be deported:\r\n\r\n    “The Polish intelligentsia who have been politically active in\r\n    the past, and potential political leaders; the leading economic\r\n    personalities, comprising owners of large estates,\r\n    industrialists and businessmen, etc.; the peasant population, so\r\n    far as it has to be removed in order to carry out by strips of\r\n    German settlements the encirclement of Polish territories in the\r\n    East * * *.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In order to relieve the living space of the Poles in the\r\n    Government-General as well as in the liberated East, one should\r\n    remove cheap labor temporarily by the hundreds of thousands,\r\n    employ them for a few years in the old Reich, and thereby hamper\r\n    their native biological propagation. (Their assimilation into\r\n    the old Reich must be prevented.) * * *” (_661-PS_)\r\n\r\nFinally, the report stated:\r\n\r\n    “Strictest care is to be taken that secret circulars, memoranda\r\n    and official correspondence which contain instructions\r\n    detrimental to the Poles are kept steadily under lock and key so\r\n    that they will not some day fill the White Books printed in\r\n    Paris or the U.S.A.” (_661-PS_)\r\n\r\nFrank made the following entry in his diary:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) wishes that all Jews be\r\n    evacuated from the newly gained Reich territories. Up to\r\n    February approximately 1,000,000 people are to be brought in\r\n    this way into the Government-General. The families of good\r\n    racial extraction present in the occupied Polish territory\r\n    (approximately 4,000,000 people) should be transferred into the\r\n    Reich and individually housed and thereby be uprooted as a\r\n    people.” (_2233-G-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe top secret minutes of a meeting held on 12 February 1940 on\r\n“questions concerning the East,” at which Goering was chairman and\r\nHimmler and Frank were present, stated, among other things:\r\n\r\n    “By way of introduction, the General Field Marshal (_Goering_)\r\n    explained that the strengthening of the war potential of the\r\n    Reich must be the chief aim of all measures to be taken in the\r\n    East. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Agriculture_:\r\n\r\n    “The task consists of obtaining the greatest possible\r\n    agriculture production from the new Eastern Gaus disregarding\r\n    questions of ownership. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “_Special questions concerning the Government-General_:\r\n\r\n    “The Government-General will have to receive the Jews who are\r\n    ordered to emigrate from Germany, and the New Eastern Gaus.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The following reported on the situation in the Eastern\r\n    territories: * * *\r\n\r\n    “2. Reichsstatthalter Gauleiter Forster: The population of the\r\n    Danzig/West Prussia Gau (newly acquired territories) is 1.5\r\n    million, of whom 240,000 are Germans, 850,000 well-established\r\n    Poles and 300,000 immigrant Poles, Jews and asocials (1,800\r\n    Jews). 87,000 persons have been evacuated, 40,000 of these from\r\n    Gotenhafen. From there, also the numerous shirkers, who are now\r\n    looked after by welfare, will have to be deported to the\r\n    Government-General. Therefore, an evacuation of 20,000 further\r\n    persons can be counted on for the current year. * * *”\r\n    (_EC-305_)\r\n\r\nComparable reports were made by other Gauleiters at this meeting. These\r\nfigures, it may be noted, were only as of February 1940.\r\n\r\nThese forcible deportations did not involve merely ordering the victims\r\nto leave their homes, and to take up new residences elsewhere. These\r\ndeportations were accomplished, according to plan, in a brutal and\r\ninhuman manner. This is shown in a speech delivered by Himmler to\r\nofficers of the SS on a day commemorating the presentation of the Nazi\r\nflag. The exact date of the speech does not appear in the document, but\r\nits contents plainly show that it was delivered sometime after Poland\r\nhad been overrun. In this speech Himmler said:\r\n\r\n    “Very frequently the member of the Waffen-SS thinks about the\r\n    deportation of this people here. These thoughts came to me today\r\n    when watching the very difficult work out there performed by the\r\n    Security Police, supported by your men, who help them a great\r\n    deal. Exactly the same thing happened in Poland in weather 40\r\n    degrees below zero, where we had to haul away thousands, ten\r\n    thousands, hundred thousands; where we had to have the toughness\r\n    * * * you should hear this but also forget it again—to shoot\r\n    thousands of leading Poles.” (_1918-PS_)\r\n\r\nSuch Poles from the incorporated area as managed to survive the journey\r\nto the Government-General could look forward at best to extreme\r\nhardship, and exposure to degradation and brutality. For the Jews who\r\nwere forcibly deported to the Government-General there was no hope.\r\nFrank, by his own admissions, had dedicated himself to their complete\r\nannihilation. In his diary Frank wrote:\r\n\r\n    “We must annihilate the Jews, wherever we find them, and\r\n    wherever it is possible.” (_2233-D-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _Forcible Return of Racial Germans to the Reich._ The conspirators\r\nhad planned the forcible Germanization of persons in the incorporated\r\narea who were deemed to possess German blood. Such persons were given\r\nthe choice of the concentration camp, or submission to Germanization.\r\nHimmler was the chief executioner of this program. In a secret decree\r\nsigned by Hitler, Goering, and Keitel, dated 7 October 1939, Himmler was\r\nentrusted with the task of executing the conspirators’ Germanization\r\nprogram. The decree provided, among other things:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) has the obligation in accordance\r\n    with my directives:\r\n\r\n    “1. To bring back for final return into the Reich all German\r\n    nationals, and racial Germans in the foreign countries.\r\n\r\n    “2. To eliminate the harmful influence of such alien-parts of\r\n    the population, which represent a danger to the Reich, and the\r\n    German folk community.\r\n\r\n    “3. The forming of new German settlements by re-settling, and in\r\n    particular by settling of the returning German citizens and\r\n    racial Germans from abroad.\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsfuehrer SS is authorized to take all necessary\r\n    general and administrative measures for the execution of this\r\n    obligation.” (_686-PS_)\r\n\r\nHimmler’s conception of his tasks under this decree were plainly stated\r\nin the foreword which he wrote for the “_Deutsche Arbeit_” issue of\r\nJune/July 1942. He wrote:\r\n\r\n    “It is not our task to Germanize the East in the old sense, that\r\n    is, to teach the people there the German language and German\r\n    law, but to see to it that only people of purely German,\r\n    Germanic blood live in the East.” (_2915-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe 1940 Edition of “_Der Menscheneinsatz_,” a confidential publication\r\nissued by Himmler’s Office for the Consolidation of German Nationhood,\r\ncontained the following statements:\r\n\r\n    “The removal of foreign races from the incorporated Eastern\r\n    Territories is one of the most essential goals to be\r\n    accomplished in the German East. This is the chief national\r\n    political task, which has to be executed in the incorporated\r\n    Eastern Territories by the Reichsfuehrer SS, Reich Commissioner\r\n    for the strengthening of the national character of the German\r\n    people.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “* * * there are the following two primary reasons, which make\r\n    the regaining of lost German blood an urgent necessity.\r\n\r\n    “1. Prevention of a further increase of the Polish\r\n    intelligentsia, through families of German descent even if they\r\n    are Polonized.\r\n\r\n    “2. Increase of the population by racial elements desirable for\r\n    the German nation, and the acquisition of ethno-biologically\r\n    unobjectionable forces for the German reconstruction of\r\n    agriculture and industry.” (_2916-PS_)\r\n\r\nFurther light upon the goals which the conspirators had set for their\r\nGermanization program in conquered Eastern areas, is contained in a\r\nspeech delivered by Himmler on 14 October 1943. This speech was\r\npublished by the National Socialist Leadership staff of the OKW. The\r\nfollowing are excerpts from this speech:\r\n\r\n    “I consider that in dealing with members of a foreign country,\r\n    especially some Slav nationality, we must not start from German\r\n    points of view, and we must not endow these people with decent\r\n    German thoughts, and logical conclusions of which they are not\r\n    capable, but we must take them as they really are * * *.”\r\n\r\n    “Obviously in such a mixture of peoples, there will always be\r\n    some racially good types. Therefore, I think that it is our duty\r\n    to take their children with us, to remove them from their\r\n    environment, if necessary by robbing, or stealing them. Either\r\n    we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves and\r\n    give it a place in our people, or * * * we destroy that blood.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “For us the end of this war will mean an open road to the East,\r\n    the creation of the Germanic Reich in this way or that * * * the\r\n    fetching home of 30 million human beings of our blood, so that\r\n    still during our lifetime we shall be a people of 120 million\r\n    Germanic souls. That means that we shall be the sole decisive\r\n    power in Europe. That means that we shall then be able to tackle\r\n    the peace, during which we shall be willing for the first twenty\r\n    years to rebuild and spread out our villages and towns, and that\r\n    we shall push the borders of our German race 500 kilometers\r\n    further out to the East.” (_L-70_)\r\n\r\n(4) _The Racial Register._ In furtherance of these plans, the\r\nconspirators established a Racial Register in the incorporated area of\r\nPoland. The Racial Register was, in effect, an elaborate classification\r\nof persons deemed to be of German blood, and contained provisions\r\nsetting forth some of the rights, privileges, and duties of the persons\r\nin each classification. Persons were classified into four groups:\r\n\r\n(1) Germans who had actively promoted the Nazi cause.\r\n\r\n(2) Germans who had been more or less passive in the Nazi struggle, but\r\nhad retained their German nationality.\r\n\r\n(3) Persons of German extraction who, although previously connected with\r\nthe Polish nation, were willing to submit to Germanization.\r\n\r\n(4) Persons of German descent, who had been “politically absorbed by the\r\nPolish nation”, and who would be resistant to Germanization.\r\n\r\nThe Racial Register was inaugurated under a decree of 12 September 1940,\r\nissued by Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German\r\nNationhood. The following are pertinent extracts:\r\n\r\n    “The list of ‘ethnic Germans’ will be divided into four parts\r\n    (limited to interoffice use).\r\n\r\n    “1. Ethnic Germans who fought actively in the ethnic struggle.\r\n    Besides the membership of a German organization, every other\r\n    activity in favor of the German against a foreign nationality\r\n    will be considered an active manifestation.\r\n\r\n    “2. Ethnic Germans, who did not actively intervene in favor of\r\n    the German nationality, but who preserved their traceable German\r\n    nationality.\r\n\r\n    “3. Persons of German descent, who became connected with the\r\n    Polish nation in the course of the years, but have on account of\r\n    their attitude, the prerequisites to become full-fledged members\r\n    of the German national community. To this group belong also\r\n    persons of non-German descent who live in a people’s mixed\r\n    marriage with an ethnic German in which the influence of the\r\n    German spouse has prevailed. Persons of Masurian, Slonzak, or\r\n    upper Silesian descent who are to be recognized as ethnic\r\n    Germans, usually belong to this group 3.\r\n\r\n    “4. Persons of German descent, politically absorbed by the\r\n    Polish nation (renegades).\r\n\r\n    “Persons not included on the list of ethnic Germans are Poles,\r\n    or foreign nationals. Their treatment is regulated by BII.\r\n\r\n    “Members of groups 1 and 2 are ethnic Germans who will be used\r\n    for the reconstruction in the East. The differentiation between\r\n    the groups 1 and 2 is important for the National Socialist\r\n    Party; primarily only members of group 1 should be accepted in\r\n    the Party according to the instructions of the deputy of the\r\n    Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n    “Members of groups 3 and 4 have to be educated as full Germans,\r\n    that is, have to be re-Germanized in the course of time through\r\n    an intensive educational training in old Germany.\r\n\r\n    “The establishment of members of group 4 has to be based on the\r\n    doctrine, that German blood must not be utilized in the interest\r\n    of a foreign nation. Against those who refuse re-Germanization,\r\n    Security Police measures are to be taken.” (_2916-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of creating a racial register for persons of German\r\nextraction was later incorporated into a decree of 3 March 1941, signed\r\nby Himmler, Frick, and Hess. This decree is set forth in the 1941\r\n_Reichsgesetzblatt_ Part 1, page 118.\r\n\r\nThe entire apparatus of the SS was thrown behind the vigorous execution\r\nof these decrees. Proof of this fact is contained in the following\r\nextracts from directives issued by Himmler as the Reich Commissioner for\r\nthe Consolidation of German Nationhood:\r\n\r\n    “I. Where Racial Germans have not applied for entry in the\r\n    ‘German Ethnical List,’ you will instruct the subordinate\r\n    agencies to turn over their names to the State Police (Superior)\r\n    Office. Subsequently, you will report to me (Himmler).\r\n\r\n    “II. The Local State Police (Superior) Office, will charge the\r\n    persons whose names are turned over to them to prove within\r\n    eight days that they have applied for entry in the ‘German\r\n    Ethnical List.’\r\n\r\n    “If such proof is not submitted, the person in question is to be\r\n    taken into protective custody for transfer into a concentration\r\n    camp.” (_R-112_)\r\n\r\nThe measures taken against persons in the fourth category, “Polonized\r\nGermans,” were particularly harsh. These persons were resistant to\r\nGermanization, and ruthless measures calculated to break their\r\nresistance were prescribed. Where the individual’s past history\r\nindicated that he could not be effectively Germanized, he was thrown\r\ninto a concentration camp. In the words of Himmler’s decree of 16\r\nFebruary 1942:\r\n\r\n    “II. The Re-Germanization of the Polonized Germans presupposes\r\n    their complete separation from Polish surroundings. For that\r\n    reason the persons entered in Division 4 of the German Ethnical\r\n    List are to be dealt with in the following manner:\r\n\r\n    “A. They are to be re-settled in Old Reich territory.\r\n\r\n    “1. The Superior SS and Police Leaders are charged with\r\n    evacuating and resettling them according to instructions which\r\n    will follow later.\r\n\r\n    “2. Asocial persons and others who are of inferior hereditary\r\n    quality will not be included in the resettlement. Their names\r\n    will be turned over at once by the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer\r\n    (Inspectors of Security Police and Security Service) to the\r\n    competent State Police (Superior) Office. The latter will\r\n    arrange for their transfer into a concentration camp.\r\n\r\n    “3. Persons with a particularly bad political record will not be\r\n    included in the resettlement action. Their names will also be\r\n    given by the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer (Inspectors of\r\n    Security Police and Security Service) to the competent State\r\n    Police (Superior) Office for transfer into a concentration camp.\r\n    The wives and children of such persons are to be resettled in\r\n    old Reich territory and to be included in the Germanization\r\n    measures. Where the wife also has a particularly bad political\r\n    record, and cannot be included in the resettlement action, her\r\n    name, too, is to be turned over to the competent State Police\r\n    (Superior) Office with a view to imprisoning her in a\r\n    concentration camp. In such cases the children are to be\r\n    separated from their parents and to be dealt with according to\r\n    III, paragraph 2 of this decree. Persons are to be considered as\r\n    having a particularly bad political record who have offended the\r\n    German nation to a very great degree (e.g., who participated in\r\n    persecutions of Germans, or boycotts of Germans, etc.).”\r\n    (_R-112_)\r\n\r\n(5) _Nazi Colonization._ Coincident with the program of Germanizing\r\npersons of German extraction in the incorporated areas, the\r\nconspirators, as previously indicated, undertook to settle large numbers\r\nof Germans of proven Nazi convictions in that area. This aspect of their\r\nprogram is clearly shown by an article by SS Obergruppenfuehrer and\r\nGeneral of the Police, Wilhelm Koppe, who was one of Himmler’s trusted\r\nagents. The following is an excerpt from this article:\r\n\r\n    “The victory of the German weapons in the East must therefore be\r\n    followed by the victory of the German race over the Polish race,\r\n    if the regained Eastern sphere—according to the Fuehrer’s\r\n    will—henceforth shall for all time remain an essential\r\n    constituent part of the Greater German Reich. It is therefore of\r\n    decisive importance to penetrate the regained German region with\r\n    German farmers, laborers, civil servants, merchants, and\r\n    artisans so that a living and deep-rooted bastion of German\r\n    people can be formed as a protective wall against foreign\r\n    infiltration, and possibly as a starting point for the racial\r\n    penetration of the territories further East.” (_2915-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Program in the Government-General_\r\n\r\n(1) _Germanization._ In the Government-General there were relatively few\r\npersons, at the outset, who qualified as Germans by the conspirators’\r\nstandards. Hence, little would be served by the introduction of a Racial\r\nRegister, categorizing persons of German extraction on the model of the\r\none instituted in the incorporated area; and it is not known that any\r\nsuch Racial Register was prescribed in the Government-General. Rather,\r\nthe plan seems to have been (_a_) to make the Government-General a\r\ncolony of Germany, which was an objective announced by Frank (_EC-344-16\r\n& 17_), and (_b_) to create so-called “German island settlements” in the\r\nproductive farming areas. These island settlements were to be created by\r\nan influx of German persons who faithfully adhered to the principles of\r\nNational Socialism.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, secret notes bearing the date line, “Department of\r\nthe Interior, Krakow, 30th March, 1942,” reveal some of Himmler’s ideas\r\non the “planned Germanization” of the Government-General. The following\r\nextracts are pertinent:\r\n\r\n    “The Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) developed further trains of\r\n    ideas to the effect that in the first five-year plan for\r\n    re-settlement after the war the new German Eastern territories\r\n    should first be filled; afterwards it is intended to provide at\r\n    this time the Crimea and the Baltic countries with a German\r\n    upper-class at least. Into the Government-General perhaps\r\n    further German Island Settlements should be newly transplanted\r\n    from European nations. An exact decision in this respect,\r\n    however, has not been issued. In any case, it is wished that at\r\n    first a heavy colonization along the San and the Brig be\r\n    achieved so that the parts of Poland are encircled with alien\r\n    populations. Hitherto, it has been always proved that this kind\r\n    of encirclement leads most quickly to the desired\r\n    nationalization.” (_910-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn entry in Frank’s Diary (1941, volume II, page 317) bears on the same\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n    “Thanks to the heroic courage of our soldiers, this territory\r\n    has become German, and the time will come when the valley of the\r\n    Vistula, from its source to its mouth at the sea, will be as\r\n    German as the Valley of the Rhine.” (_2233-H-PS_)\r\n\r\n(2) _Confiscation of Property._ The conspirators had made plans to\r\nconfiscate the property of Poles, Jews, and dissident elements. These\r\nplans were designed to accomplish a number of objectives. Insofar as the\r\nJews were concerned, they were part of the conspirators’ over-all\r\nprogram of extermination. Confiscation was also a means of providing\r\nproperty for German settlers and of rewarding those who had rendered\r\nfaithful service to the Nazi State. This phase of their program likewise\r\nmade dispossessed Polish farmers available for slave labor in Germany,\r\nand operated to further the conspirators’ objective of preventing the\r\ngrowth of another generation of Poles.\r\n\r\nProof of these matters appears in a number of reports by Kusche, who\r\nappears to have been one of Himmler’s chief deputies in Poland. In one\r\nof these reports Kusche pointed out that it was possible, without\r\ndifficulty, to confiscate small farms and that\r\n\r\n    “The former owners of Polish farms together with their families\r\n    will be transferred to the old Reich by the employment agencies\r\n    for employment as farm workers.” (_1352-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn another secret report by Kusche dated 22 May 1940, and entitled\r\n“Details of the Confiscation in the Bielitz Country”, the following\r\nappears:\r\n\r\n    “Some days ago the commandant of the concentration camp being\r\n    built at Auschwitz spoke at Staff Leader Muller’s and requested\r\n    support for the carrying out of his assignments. He said that it\r\n    was absolutely necessary to confiscate the agricultural\r\n    enterprises within a certain area around the concentration camp,\r\n    since not only the fields but also the farm houses of these\r\n    border directly on the concentration camp. A local inspection\r\n    held on the 21st of this month revealed the following: there is\r\n    no room for doubt that agricultural enterprises bordering on the\r\n    concentration camp must be confiscated at once. Further than\r\n    this, the camp commandant requests that further plots of\r\n    farmland be placed at his disposal, so that he can keep the\r\n    prisoners busy. This too can be done without further delay since\r\n    enough land can be made available for the purpose. The owners of\r\n    the plots are all Poles.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I had the following discussion with the head of the labor\r\n    office in Bielitz:\r\n\r\n    “The lack of agricultural laborers still exists in the old\r\n    Reich. The transfer of the previous owners of the confiscated\r\n    enterprises, together with their entire families, to the Reich\r\n    is possible without any further consideration. It is only\r\n    necessary for the labor office to receive the lists of the\r\n    persons in time, in order to enable it to take the necessary\r\n    steps (collection of transportation, distribution over the\r\n    various regions in need of such labor)”.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The confiscation of these Polish enterprises in Alzen will also\r\n    be carried out within the next few days. The commandant of the\r\n    concentration camp will furnish SS men and a truck for the\r\n    execution of the action. Should it not yet be possible to take\r\n    the Poles from Alzen to Auschwitz, they should be transferred to\r\n    the empty castle at Zator. The liberated Polish property is to\r\n    be given to the needy racial German farmers for their use.”\r\n    (_1352-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 17 September 1940, Goering issued a decree which was designed to\r\nregularize the program of confiscation (_Reichsgesetzblatt_, 1940, Part\r\nI, page 1270). Under Section 2 of this decree, sequestration of movable\r\nand immovable property, stores, and other intangible property interests\r\nof Jews and “persons who have fled or are not merely temporarily absent”\r\nwas made mandatory. In addition, sequestration was authorized under\r\nSection 2, sub-section 2, if the property were required “for the public\r\nwelfare, particularly in the interests of Reich defense or the\r\nstrengthening of Germanism.” By section 9 of the decree, confiscation of\r\nsequestrated property was authorized “if the public welfare,\r\nparticularly the defense of the Reich, or the strengthening of\r\nGermanism, so requires.” However, Section 1, sub-section 2, provided\r\nthat property of German nationals was not subject to sequestration and\r\nconfiscation; and section 13 provided that sequestration would be\r\nsuspended if the owner of the property asserted that he was a German.\r\nThe decree, on its face, clearly indicates a purpose to strip Poles,\r\nJews, and dissident elements of their property. It was, moreover,\r\navowedly designed to promote Germanism.\r\n\r\nApparently some question arose at one point as to whether the decree\r\nrequired that a determination be made in each case involving the\r\nproperty of a Pole that the property was required “for the public\r\nwelfare, particularly in the interests of Reich defense or the\r\nstrengthening of Germanism.” The answer supplied by the conspirators was\r\nfirm and clear: In _any_ case in which the property of a Pole was\r\ninvolved, the “strengthening of Germanism” required its seizure. On 15\r\nApril 1941, on paper bearing the letterhead of the Reich Leader SS,\r\nCommissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood, instructions\r\nwere given “for internal use on the application of the law concerning\r\nproperty of the Poles of 17 September 1940.” The following is an\r\nexcerpt:\r\n\r\n    “The conditions permitting seizure according to section II,\r\n    sub-section 2, are always present if the property belongs to a\r\n    Pole. For the Polish real estate will be needed without\r\n    exception for the consolidation of the German nationhood.”\r\n    (_R-92_)\r\n\r\nIn the Government-General, Frank promulgated a decree on 24 January\r\n1940, authorizing sequestration “in connection with the performance of\r\ntasks serving the public interest”, and liquidation of “anti-social or\r\nfinancially unremunerative concerns.” The decree is embodied in the\r\n_Verordnungsblatt_ of the Government-General, No. 6, 27 January 1940,\r\npage 23. The undefined criteria in this decree clearly empowered Nazi\r\nofficials in the Government-General to engage in wholesale seizure of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the conspirators’ confiscation program in Poland was\r\nstaggering. The Nazis’ own statistics show that as of 31 May 1943, a\r\ntotal of 693,252 estates, comprising 6,097,525 hectares, had been\r\nseized, and 9,508 estates, comprising 270,446 hectares had been\r\nconfiscated by the Estate Offices Danzig-West Prussia, Poznan, Zichenau,\r\nand Silesia (_R-92_). This, it will be noted, represented the seizures\r\nand confiscations which were effected by only four offices. Figures are\r\nnot available at this time for other offices maintained by the\r\nconspirators for these purposes.\r\n\r\n                           2. CZECHOSLOVAKIA\r\n\r\nThe conspirators had given much thought to their plans to Germanize\r\nBohemia and Moravia. Three plans, each characterized by severity, were\r\ndiscussed, and finally the Fuehrer decided on plan (_c_), which involved\r\nthe assimilation of about one-half the Czech population by the Germans\r\nand the extermination of the other half. Moreover, this plan envisaged a\r\nlarge influx into Czechoslovakia of Germans whose loyalty to the Fuehrer\r\nwas unquestioned.\r\n\r\nThese matters appear from a top secret report dated 15 October 1940,\r\nwritten by General Friderici, Deputy General of the Wehrmacht in Bohemia\r\nand Moravia. On the face of the document, it appears that only four\r\ncopies were made. The original document bears the handwritten letters\r\n“K” and “J” on the first page on the left side, and the handwriting is\r\nunquestionably that of Keitel and Jodl. The report states:\r\n\r\n    “On 9 October of this year the office of the Reich Protector\r\n    held an official conference in which State Secretary SS Lt.\r\n    General K. H. Frank spoke about the following: [SS\r\n    Gruppenfuehrer K. H. Frank was Secretary of State under Von\r\n    Neurath, who at the date of this report was the Protector of\r\n    Bohemia and Moravia].\r\n\r\n    “Since creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,\r\n    Party agencies, industrial circles, as well as agencies of the\r\n    central authorities of Berlin have had difficulties about the\r\n    solution of the Czech problem.\r\n\r\n    “After ample deliberation, the Reich Protector expressed his\r\n    views about the various plans in a memorandum. In this way,\r\n    three ways of solution were indicated:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ German infiltration of Moravia and reduction of the Czech\r\n    nationality to a residual Bohemia. This solution is considered\r\n    unsatisfactory, because the Czech problem, even if in a\r\n    diminished form, will continue to exist.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Many arguments can be brought up against the most radical\r\n    solution, namely, the deportation of all the Czechs. Therefore,\r\n    the memorandum comes to the conclusion that it cannot be carried\r\n    out within a reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ Assimilation of the Czechs, i.e., absorption of about half\r\n    of the Czech nationality by the Germans, insofar as this is of\r\n    importance by being valuable from a racial or other standpoint.\r\n    This will take place, among other things, also by increasing the\r\n    _Arbeitseinsatz_ of the Czechs in the Reich territory (with the\r\n    exception of the Sudeten-German border district), in other\r\n    words, by dispersing the closed Czech nationality.\r\n\r\n    “The other half of the Czech nationality must be deprived of its\r\n    power, eliminated and shipped out of the country by all sorts of\r\n    methods. This applies particularly to the racially mongoloid\r\n    part and to the major part of the intellectual class. The latter\r\n    can scarcely be converted ideologically and would represent a\r\n    burden by constantly making claims for the leadership over the\r\n    other Czech classes and thus interfering with a rapid\r\n    assimilation.\r\n\r\n    “Elements which counteract the planned Germanization ought to be\r\n    handled roughly and should be eliminated.\r\n\r\n    “The above development naturally presupposes an increased influx\r\n    of Germans from the Reich territory into the Protectorate.\r\n\r\n    “After a discussion, the Fuehrer has chosen solution (_c_)\r\n    (Assimilation) as a directive for the solution of the Czech\r\n    problem and decided that, while keeping up the autonomy of the\r\n    Protectorate on the surface, the Germanization will have to be\r\n    carried out in a centralized way by the office of the Reich\r\n    Protector for years to come.\r\n\r\n    “From the above no particular conclusions are drawn by the armed\r\n    forces. This is the direction which has always been represented\r\n    from here. In this connection, I refer to my memorandum which\r\n    was sent to the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\n    Forces, dated 12 July 1939, file number 6/39, top secret,\r\n    entitled: “The Czech Problem.” (Attached as annex.)\r\n\r\n    “The Deputy General of the Armed Forces with the Reich Protector\r\n    in Bohemia and Moravia.”\r\n\r\n                                             “(Signed)  FRIDERICI\r\n                                 Infantry Lt. General.”  (_862-PS_)\r\n\r\nSolution (_a_), as outlined in the foregoing report, would have called\r\nfor German infiltration into Moravia and the forcible removal of the\r\nCzechs from that area to Bohemia. Moravia lies between Bohemia and\r\nSlovakia. Thus, solution (_a_) would have involved the erection of a\r\nGerman state between Bohemia and Slovakia, and would have prevented\r\neffective inter-communications between the Czechs and the Slovaks. In\r\nthis manner, the historic desire for unity of these two groups of people\r\nand the continued existence of their Czechoslovakian State would have\r\nbeen frustrated. Solution (_a_) was rejected because the surviving\r\nCzechs, even though compressed into a “residual Bohemia,” would have\r\nremained to plague the conspirators.\r\n\r\nSolution (_b_), which involved the forcible deportation of all Czechs,\r\nwas rejected, not because its terms were deemed too drastic but rather\r\nbecause a more speedy resolution of the problem was desired.\r\n\r\nSolution (_c_) was regarded as the most desirable, and was adopted. This\r\nsolution first provided for the assimilation of about one-half of the\r\nCzechs. This meant two things: (_a_) enforced Germanization for those\r\nwho were deemed racially qualified, and (_b_) deportation to slave labor\r\nin Germany for others. “Increasing the _Arbeitseinsatz_ of the Czechs in\r\nthe Reich territory”, as stated in the report, meant, in reality, slave\r\nlabor in Germany.\r\n\r\nSolution (_c_) further provided for the elimination and deportation “by\r\nall sorts of methods” of the other half of the Czech population,\r\nparticularly intellectuals and those who did not meet Nazi racial\r\nstandards. Czech intellectuals, as the conspirators well know, had a\r\nconspicuous record of resistance to the Nazi ideology. They were,\r\ntherefore, to be exterminated. That section of the report which stated,\r\n“elements which counteract the planned Germanization are to be handled\r\nroughly and should be eliminated,” meant that intellectuals and other\r\ndissident elements were either to be thrown in concentration camps or\r\nimmediately exterminated.\r\n\r\nIn short, the provisions of solution (_c_) were simply a practical\r\napplication of the conspirators’ philosophy as expressed in Himmler’s\r\nspeech referred to above:\r\n\r\n    “Either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves\r\n    * * * or we destroy this blood.” (_L-70_)\r\n\r\n                           3. THE U. S. S. R.\r\n\r\n(The Chief Prosecutor for the Soviet Union has assumed the task of\r\nintroducing detailed evidence showing the results of the execution of\r\nthis program. The American prosecution confined itself to showing the\r\nplan.)\r\n\r\nThe evidence, individual items of which will be discussed hereafter,\r\nshows the following:\r\n\r\nA. The conspirators planned to remove to Germany all foodstuffs and raw\r\nmaterials from the south and southeast of the Soviet Union, over and\r\nabove the needs of the Nazi invading forces and the absolute minimum\r\nnecessary to supply the bare needs of the people in these particular\r\nregions who produced the materials which were to be removed to Germany.\r\nThis region had previously supplied the northern area of the Soviet\r\nUnion, which the conspirators called the “Forest Zone”. The latter zone\r\nembraced some of the leading industrial areas of the Soviet Union,\r\nincluding Moscow and Leningrad.\r\n\r\nB. They deliberately and systematically planned to starve millions of\r\nRussians. Starvation was to be accomplished by the following means:\r\n\r\n(1) As indicated under A above, products from the south and southeast of\r\nthe Soviet Union which ordinarily were sent to the industrial regions of\r\nthe north were to be forcibly diverted to Germany. Moreover, all\r\nlivestock in the industrial regions was to be seized for use by the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ and the German civilian population. The necessary\r\nconsequence was that the population of the northern regions would be\r\nreduced to starvation.\r\n\r\n(2) They established the following order of priority in which food\r\nproduced by the Russians would be allocated:\r\n\r\n    First, the combat troops.\r\n\r\n    Second, the remainder of troops in enemy territory.\r\n\r\n    Third, troops stationed in Germany.\r\n\r\n    Fourth, the German civilian population, and\r\n\r\n    Lastly, the population of the occupied countries.\r\n\r\nThus, even Russians in the food-surplus area of the Ukraine, who were\r\nnot essential to the production of products for the German war machine,\r\nwere systematically to be starved.\r\n\r\nC. They planned the permanent destruction of all industry in the\r\nnorthern area of the Soviet Union in order that the remnants of the\r\nRussian population would be completely dependent upon Germany for\r\nconsumer goods.\r\n\r\nD. They planned to incorporate a part of Galicia and all of the Baltic\r\ncountries into Germany and to convert the Crimea, an area north of the\r\nCrimea, the Volga territory, and the district around Baku, into German\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nBy a directive issued by Goering’s office for “The Operation of the\r\nEconomy in the newly-occupied Eastern Territories,” there was\r\nestablished the Economic Executive Staff, East, which was directly\r\nresponsible to Goering, under which was created the Economic Staff,\r\nEast. The Economic Staff, East, in turn was subdivided into four groups:\r\nthe Chief of the Economic Staff, Group LA, Group W, and Group M. The\r\nfunctions of Group LA were stated to be as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Group LA. (Functions: nutrition and agriculture, the economy of\r\n    all agricultural products, provision of supplies for the Army,\r\n    in cooperation with the Army groups concerned.)” (_EC-472_)\r\n\r\nA report was made on 23 May 1941 (which was before the invasion of the\r\nSoviet Union) on the subject, “Economic Policy Directives for Economic\r\nOrganization, East, Agricultural Group.” (_EC-126_). It was prepared by\r\nthe Economic Staff, East, Group LA, the Agricultural Group, which (as\r\nshown by _EC-472_) was an important part of the organization which\r\nGoering had established to formulate plans for the economic\r\nadministration of Russia. The report begins by a recitation of figures\r\npertaining to the production of agricultural products in the Soviet\r\nUnion. It states that the grain surplus of Russia is determined by the\r\nlevel of domestic consumption and that this fact affords the basis upon\r\nwhich the planners must predicate their actions and economic policy. The\r\nreport continues:\r\n\r\n    “The surplus territories are situated in the black soil district\r\n    (that is in the south and southeast) and in the Caucasus. The\r\n    deficit areas are principally located in the forest zone of the\r\n    north. Therefore, an isolation of the black soil areas must, in\r\n    any case, place greater or lesser surpluses in these regions at\r\n    our disposal. The consequences will be cessation of supplies to\r\n    the entire forest zone, including the essential industrial\r\n    centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “This (the cessation of supplies) means:\r\n\r\n    “1. All industry in the deficit area, particularly the\r\n    manufacturing industries in the Moscow and Petersburg regions as\r\n    well as the Ural industrial regions will be abandoned. It may be\r\n    assumed that these regions today absorb an annual five to ten\r\n    million tons from the food production zone.\r\n\r\n    “2. The Trans-Caucasian oil district will have to be excepted,\r\n    although it is a deficit area. This source of oil, cotton,\r\n    manganese, copper, silk, and tea must continue to be supplied\r\n    with food in any case, for special political and economic\r\n    reasons.\r\n\r\n    “3. No further exceptions with a view to preserving one or the\r\n    other industrial region or industrial enterprise must be\r\n    permitted.\r\n\r\n    “4. Industry can only be preserved so far as it is located in\r\n    the surplus region. This applies, apart from the above-mentioned\r\n    oil field regions in the Caucasus, particularly to the heavy\r\n    industries in the Donets district (Ukraine). Only the future\r\n    will show to what extent it will prove possible to maintain in\r\n    full these industries, and in particular the Ukrainian\r\n    manufacturing industries, after the withdrawal of the food\r\n    surpluses required by Germany.\r\n\r\n    “The following consequences result from this situation, which\r\n    has received the approval of the highest authorities, since it\r\n    is in accord with the political tendencies (preservation of the\r\n    small Russians, preservation of the Caucasus, of the Baltic\r\n    provinces, of White Russia, to the prejudice of the Great\r\n    Russians).\r\n\r\n    “I. _For the forest belt_:\r\n\r\n    “_a._ Production in the forest belt (the food-deficit area) will\r\n    become ‘naturalized,’ similar to the events during the World War\r\n    and the Communistic tendencies of the war, etc., namely:\r\n    agriculture in that territory will begin to become a mere ‘home\r\n    production.’ The result will be that the planting of products\r\n    destined for the market such as, in particular, flax and hemp,\r\n    will be discontinued, and the area used therefor will be taken\r\n    over for products for the producer (grain, potatoes, etc.)\r\n    Moreover, discontinuance of fodder for that area will lead to\r\n    the collapse of the dairy production and pig producing in that\r\n    territory.\r\n\r\n    “_b._ Germany is not interested in the maintenance of the\r\n    productive power of these territories, except for supplying the\r\n    troops stationed there. The population, as in the old days, will\r\n    utilize arable land for growing its own food. It is useless to\r\n    expect grain or other surpluses to be produced. Only after many\r\n    years can these extensive regions be intensified to an extent\r\n    that they might produce genuine surpluses. The population of\r\n    these areas, in particular the urban population, will have to\r\n    face most serious distress from famine. It will be necessary to\r\n    divert the population into the Siberian spaces. Since rail\r\n    transport is out of the question, this too, will be an extremely\r\n    difficult problem.\r\n\r\n    “_c._ In this situation, Germany will only draw substantial\r\n    advantages by quick, nonrecurrent seizure, that is, it will be\r\n    vitally necessary to make the entire flax harvest available for\r\n    German needs, not only the fibers but also the oleaginous seeds.\r\n\r\n    “It will also be necessary to utilize for German purposes the\r\n    livestock which has no fodder base of its own, that is, it will\r\n    be necessary _to seize livestock holdings_ immediately, and to\r\n    make them available to the troops not only for the moment, but\r\n    in the long run, and also for exportation to Germany. Since\r\n    fodder supplies will be cut off, pig and cattle holdings in\r\n    these areas will of necessity drastically decline in the near\r\n    future. If they are not seized by the Germans at an early date,\r\n    they will be slaughtered by the population for its own use,\r\n    without Germany getting anything out of it.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It has been demanded by the Fuehrer that the reduction in the\r\n    meat ration should be made good by the fall. This can only be\r\n    achieved by the most drastic seizures of Russian livestock\r\n    holdings, particularly in areas which are in a favorable\r\n    transport situation in relation to Germany.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “In future, southern Russia must turn its face toward Europe.\r\n    Its food surpluses, however, will only be paid for if it\r\n    purchases its industrial consumer goods from Germany, or Europe.\r\n    Russian competition from the forest zone must, therefore, be\r\n    abolished.\r\n\r\n    “It follows from all that has been said that the German\r\n    administration in these territories may well attempt to mitigate\r\n    the consequences of the famine which undoubtedly will take\r\n    place, and to accelerate the return to primitive agricultural\r\n    conditions. An attempt might be made to intensify cultivation in\r\n    these areas by expanding the acreage under potatoes or other\r\n    important food crops giving a high yield. However, these\r\n    measures will not avert famine. Many tens of millions of people\r\n    in this area will become redundant and will either die or have\r\n    to emigrate to Siberia. Any attempt to save the population there\r\n    from death by starvation by importing surpluses from the black\r\n    soil zone would be at the expense of supplies to Europe. It\r\n    would reduce Germany’s staying power in the war, and would\r\n    undermine Germany’s and Europe’s power to resist the blockade.\r\n    This must be clearly and absolutely understood.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I.

This\r\n    minimum aim, the provisioning of the _Wehrmacht_ from enemy\r\n    territory in the third year, and if necessary in later years,\r\n    must be attained at any price. This means that one-third of the\r\n    _Wehrmacht_ must be fully provisioned by French deliveries to\r\n    the army of occupation. The remaining two-thirds (and even\r\n    slightly more in view of the present size of the Wehrmacht) must\r\n    without exception be provisioned from the Eastern _space_.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Thus it is not important, under any circumstances, to preserve\r\n    what has existed, but what matters is a deliberate turning away\r\n    from the existing situation and introducing Russian food\r\n    resources into the European framework. This will inevitably\r\n    result in an extinction of industry as well as a large part of\r\n    the people in what so far have been the food-deficit areas.\r\n\r\n    “It is impossible to state an alternative in sufficiently hard\r\n    and severe terms.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “Our problem is not to replace intensive food production in\r\n    Europe through the incorporation of new space in the East, but\r\n    to replace imports from overseas by imports from the East. The\r\n    task is twofold:\r\n\r\n    “1. We must use the eastern spaces for overcoming the food\r\n    shortages during and after the war. This means that we must not\r\n    be afraid of drawing upon the capital substance of the East.\r\n    Such an intervention is much more acceptable from the European\r\n    standpoint than drawing upon the capital substance of Europe’s\r\n    agriculture.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “2. For the future new order, the food-producing areas in the\r\n    East must be turned into a permanent and substantial\r\n    complementary source of food for Europe, through intensified\r\n    cultivation and resulting higher yields.\r\n\r\n    “The first-named task must be accomplished at any price, even\r\n    through the most ruthless cutting down of Russian domestic\r\n    consumption, which will require discrimination between the\r\n    consuming and producing zones.” (_EC-126_)\r\n\r\nIt is submitted that this document discloses, on its face, a studied\r\nplan to murder millions of people through starvation. It reveals a\r\nprogram of premeditated murder on a scale so vast as to stagger human\r\nimagination. This plan was the logical culmination of general objectives\r\nclearly announced by Adolf Hitler in _Mein Kampf_. (See Section 6 of\r\nChapter IX.)\r\n\r\nA top secret memorandum, dated 16 July, 1941, of a conference at the\r\nFuehrer’s headquarters concerning the war in the East, seems to have\r\nbeen prepared by Bormann, because his initials appear at the top of page\r\none (_L-221_). The text of the memorandum indicates that the conference\r\nwas attended by Hitler, Lammers, Goering, Keitel, Rosenberg, and\r\nBormann. This memorandum throws light upon the conspirators’ plans to\r\nGermanize conquered areas of the Soviet Union. It also discloses the\r\nfraudulent character of the Nazi propaganda program; and shows how the\r\nconspirators sought to deceive the entire world; how they pretended to\r\npursue one course of action when their aims and purposes were to follow\r\nprecisely the opposite course. The following portions are particularly\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\n    “Now it was essential that we did not publicize our aims before\r\n    the world; also there was no need for that, but the main thing\r\n    was that we ourselves knew what we wanted. By no means should we\r\n    render our task more difficult by making superfluous\r\n    declarations. Such declarations were superfluous because we\r\n    could do everything wherever we had the power, and what was\r\n    beyond our power we would not be able to do anyway.\r\n\r\n    “What we told the world about the motives for our measures ought\r\n    to be conditioned, therefore, by tactical reasons. We ought to\r\n    act here in exactly the same way as we did in the cases of\r\n    Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium. In these cases too we did\r\n    not publish our aims, and it was only sensible to continue in\r\n    the same way.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, we shall emphasize again that we were forced to\r\n    occupy, administer, and secure a certain area; it was in the\r\n    interest of the inhabitants that we provided order, food,\r\n    traffic, etc., hence our measures. Nobody shall be able to\r\n    recognize that it initiates final settlement. This need not\r\n    prevent our taking all necessary measures—shooting,\r\n    de-settling, etc.—and we shall take them.\r\n\r\n    “But we do not want to make any people into enemies prematurely\r\n    and unnecessarily. Therefore we shall act as though we wanted to\r\n    exercise a mandate only. At the same time we must know clearly\r\n    that we shall never leave those countries.\r\n\r\n    “Our conduct therefore ought to be:\r\n\r\n    “1. To do nothing which might obstruct the final settlement, but\r\n    to prepare for it only in secret. * * *”\r\n\r\n    “2. To emphasize that we are liberators.\r\n\r\n    “In particular: The Crimea has to be evacuated by all foreigners\r\n    and to be settled by Germans only. In the same way the former\r\n    Austrian part of Galicia will become Reich territory.\r\n\r\n    “Our present relations with Roumania are good, but nobody knows\r\n    what they will be at any future time. This we have to consider,\r\n    and we have to draw our frontiers accordingly. One ought not to\r\n    be dependent on the good will of other people. We have to plan\r\n    our relations with Roumania in accordance with this principle.\r\n\r\n    “On principle, we have now to face the task of cutting up the\r\n    giant cake according to our needs, in order to be able—\r\n\r\n        “first, to dominate it;\r\n\r\n        “second, to administer it, and;\r\n\r\n        “third, to exploit it.\r\n\r\n    “The Russians have now ordered partisan warfare behind our\r\n    front. This partisan war again has some advantage for us; it\r\n    enables us to eradicate everyone who opposes us.\r\n\r\n    “Principles: Never again must it be possible to create a\r\n    military power west of the Urals, even if we have to wage war\r\n    for a hundred years in order to attain this goal. Every\r\n    successor of the Fuehrer should know: security for the Reich\r\n    exists only if there are no foreign military forces west of the\r\n    Urals; it is Germany who undertakes the protection of this area\r\n    against all possible danger. Our iron principle is and has to\r\n    remain: We must never permit anybody but the Germans to carry\r\n    arms.”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer emphasizes that the entire Baltic country will have\r\n    to be incorporated into Germany.\r\n\r\n    “At the same time the Crimea, including a considerable\r\n    hinterland, (situated north of the Crimea) should become Reich\r\n    territory; the hinterland should be as large as possible.\r\n\r\n    “Rosenberg objects to this because of the Ukrainians living\r\n    there.\r\n\r\n    “Incidental question: It occurred to me several times that\r\n    Rosenberg has a soft spot for the Ukrainians; thus he desires to\r\n    aggrandize the former Ukraine to a considerable extent.”\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer emphasizes furthermore that the Volga Colony, too,\r\n    will have to become Reich territory, also the district around\r\n    Baku; the latter will have to become a German concession\r\n    (military colony).”\r\n\r\n    “The Finns wanted East Carelia, but the Kola Peninsula will be\r\n    taken by Germany because of the large nickel mines there.\r\n\r\n    “The annexation of Finland as a federated state should be\r\n    prepared with caution. The area around Leningrad is wanted by\r\n    the Finns; the Fuehrer will raze Leningrad to the ground and\r\n    then hand it over to the Finns.” (_L-221_)\r\n\r\nThus, the program, as outlined by the conspirators at this meeting of 16\r\nJuly, 1941, called for the unlawful incorporation of a part of Galicia\r\nand all the Baltic countries into Germany; and for the unlawful\r\nconversion of the Crimea and areas north of it, the Volga territory and\r\nthe district around Baku, into German colonies.\r\n\r\nThis point is reinforced by a directive entitled, “Instruction for a\r\nReich Commissar in the Baltic Countries and White Russia,” which states:\r\n\r\n    “The aim of a Reich Commissar for Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\n    and White Russia [last two words added in pencil] must be to\r\n    strive to achieve the form of a German protectorate, and then\r\n    transform the region into part of the Greater German Reich by\r\n    Germanizing racially possible elements, colonizing Germanic\r\n    races, and banishing undesirable elements. The Baltic Sea must\r\n    become a Germanic inland sea, under the guardianship of Greater\r\n    Germany.” (_1029-PS_)\r\n\r\nEven in the food-surplus areas of the occupied regions of the Ukraine,\r\nthe conspirators planned to allocate food on a basis which left\r\nvirtually nothing for those persons who were not engaged in the\r\ncompulsory production of commodities for the German war machine. This\r\nwas in violation of the explicit provision in Article 52 of the Hague\r\nRegulations of 1907, that requisitions in kind and services shall not be\r\ndemanded from municipalities or inhabitants except for the needs of the\r\narmy of occupation. This program was disclosed in a top secret\r\nmemorandum, dated 18 September, 1941, concerning a meeting of German\r\nmilitary officials presided over by Goering (_EC-3_). The memorandum was\r\nsigned by General Nagl, liaison officer between Goering’s Four Year Plan\r\nOffice and the OKW. The memorandum states:\r\n\r\n    “At this conference which was concerned with the better\r\n    exploitation of the occupied territories for the German food\r\n    economy, the Reich Marshal (Goering) called attention to the\r\n    following:”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “It is clear that a graduated scale of food allocations is\r\n    needed.\r\n\r\n    “First in line are the combat troops, then the remainder of\r\n    troops in enemy territory, and then those troops stationed at\r\n    home. The rates are adjusted accordingly. The supply of the\r\n    German nonmilitary population follows and only then comes the\r\n    population of the occupied territories.” (_EC-3_)\r\n\r\nAnother memorandum, dated 25 November 1941, relating to the general\r\nprinciples of economic policy in the newly-occupied eastern territories,\r\nas prescribed in a conference held in Berlin on 8 November 1941, also\r\nbears out this point. This memorandum was also written by General Nagl.\r\nIt is on the stationery of the Supreme Headquarters Armament Procurement\r\nOffice. The following portions are pertinent:\r\n\r\n    “I. For the duration of the war the requirements of the war\r\n    economy will be the all-dominant factor of any economic measures\r\n    in the newly-occupied Eastern territories.\r\n\r\n    “II. Seen from a long range point of view the newly-occupied\r\n    eastern areas will be exploited economically from the point of\r\n    view of colonial administration and by colonial methods.\r\n\r\n    “Exceptions will be made only for those parts of the Eastland\r\n    which are to be Germanized by order of the Fuehrer, but even\r\n    they are subject to the principle expressed in paragraph I.\r\n\r\n    “III. The main emphasis of all economic work rests with the\r\n    production of food and raw materials.\r\n\r\n    “The highest possible production surplus for the supply of the\r\n    Reich and of other European countries is to be attained by cheap\r\n    production based on the maintenance of the low living standard\r\n    of the native population. Besides covering thereby the European\r\n    needs for food supplies and raw materials as far as possible,\r\n    this measure is intended to create a source of income for the\r\n    Reich which will make it possible to liquidate in a few decades,\r\n    with utmost consideration for the German taxpayer, an essential\r\n    part of the debts incurred in the financing of the war.”\r\n    (_EC-3_)\r\n\r\nOn 17 July, 1941, Hitler and Keitel issued a decree appointing Rosenberg\r\nas Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories. This was the day\r\nfollowing the meeting at the Fuehrer’s headquarters, which is reported\r\nin the document previously quoted from (_L-221_). This decree states,\r\n_inter alia_:\r\n\r\n    “The Civil Administration in the newly-occupied Eastern\r\n    territories where these territories are not included in the\r\n    administration of the territories bordering on the Reich or the\r\n    Government-General, is subject to the Reich Minister for the\r\n    Occupied Eastern Territories.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “I appoint Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as Reich Minister for\r\n    the occupied Eastern territories. He will hold office in\r\n    Berlin.” (_1997-PS_)\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s views well fitted him for his task as one of the chief\r\nexecutioners of the conspirators’ plans in the Soviet Union. His views\r\nwere plainly expressed in a speech delivered on 20 June 1941:\r\n\r\n    “The job of feeding the German people, stands, this year,\r\n    without a doubt, at the top of the list of Germany’s claims on\r\n    the East; and here the southern territories and the northern\r\n    Caucasus will have to serve as a balance for the feeding of the\r\n    German people. We see absolutely no reason for any obligation on\r\n    our part to feed also the Russian people with the products of\r\n    that surplus territory. We know that this is a harsh necessity,\r\n    bare of any feelings.” (_1058-PS_)\r\n\r\nThese views were implemented in the directives issued by Rosenberg in\r\nhis capacity as Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories.\r\nAmong his directives were these:\r\n\r\n    “The principal task of the civilian administration in the\r\n    occupied Eastern territories is to represent the interest of the\r\n    Reich. This basic principle is to be given precedence in all\r\n    measures and considerations. Therefore, the occupied\r\n    territories, in the future, may be permitted to have a life of\r\n    their own in a form not as yet to be determined. However, they\r\n    remain parts of the Greater German living space and are always\r\n    to be governed according to this guiding principle.\r\n\r\n    “The regulations of the Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which\r\n    concern the administration of a country occupied by a foreign\r\n    belligerent power, are not applicable, since the USSR is to be\r\n    considered dissolved, and therefore the Reich has the obligation\r\n    of exercising all governmental and other sovereign functions in\r\n    the interests of the country’s inhabitants. Therefore, any\r\n    measures are permitted which the German administration deems\r\n    necessary and suitable for the execution of this comprehensive\r\n    task.” (_EC-347_)\r\n\r\nImplicit in Rosenberg’s statement that the Hague Regulations are not\r\napplicable to the Soviet Union is the recognition by him that the\r\nconspirators’ action in the Soviet Union flagrantly violated the Hague\r\nRegulations and applicable principles of International Law.\r\n\r\nA top secret memorandum, dated 5 October 1942, written by Braeutigam,\r\nwho was a high official in Rosenberg’s Ministry for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories, made the following statements:\r\n\r\n    “In the East, Germany is carrying on a threefold war: a war for\r\n    the destruction of Bolshevism, a war for the destruction of the\r\n    greater Russian Empire, and finally a war for the acquisition of\r\n    colonial territory for colonizing purposes and economic\r\n    exploitation.\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “With the inherent instinct of the Eastern peoples the primitive\r\n    man soon found out also that for Germany the slogan: ‘Liberation\r\n    from Bolshevism’ was only a pretext to enslave the Eastern\r\n    peoples according to her own methods.” (_294-PS_)\r\n\r\nCertain German industrialists and financiers aided and abetted Himmler\r\nin his relentless program of Germanization, exploitation, oppression,\r\nand destruction. A letter from the banker, Baron Kurt von Schroeder to\r\nHimmler, dated 27 August 1943, stated:\r\n\r\n    “My very honorable Reichsfuehrer:\r\n\r\n    “With great joy I learn of your appointment as Reichsminister of\r\n    the Interior and take the liberty to extend my heartiest\r\n    congratulations to you on assuming your new post.\r\n\r\n    “A strong hand is now very necessary in the operation of this\r\n    Department and it is universally welcomed but especially by your\r\n    friends that it was you who were chosen for this by the Fuehrer.\r\n    Please be assured that we will always do everything in our power\r\n    at all times to assist you in every possible way.\r\n\r\n    “I am pleased to inform you at this opportunity that your circle\r\n    of friends has again placed at your disposal this year a sum\r\n    slightly in excess of RM 1 million for ‘special purposes.’ An\r\n    exact list showing the name of the contributors will be sent to\r\n    you shortly.\r\n\r\n    “Again all my very best wishes—as well as those of my family—I\r\n    remain yours, in old loyalty and esteem.\r\n\r\n“Heil Hitler!                 Yours truly.”                   (_EC-454_)\r\n\r\nA later letter from von Schroeder to Himmler, dated 21 September 1943,\r\nenclosed the list of contributors. The letter stated:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Reichsleader:\r\n\r\n    “I thank you very much for your kind letter of the 14th of this\r\n    month with which you made me very happy. At the same time, I am\r\n    enclosing a list with the total amount of funds made available\r\n    to you by your circle of friends and totalling RM 1,000,000. We\r\n    are very glad indeed to render some assistance to you in your\r\n    special tasks and to be able to provide some small relief for\r\n    you in your still further extended sphere of duties.\r\n\r\n    “Wishing you, dear Reichsleader, the best of luck, I remain in\r\n    old loyalty and esteem.\r\n\r\n“Heil Hitler!              Yours very truly.”                (_EC-453_)\r\n\r\nThe Himmler “circle of friends,” it may be noted, was a relatively\r\nsmall, select group. It did not include all, or even a majority of the\r\nindustrialists and financiers in Germany. These contributions were not\r\nlike the “_Hitler Spende_” or the Winter Relief contributions which were\r\nexacted from all industrialists by the Nazi state. These were\r\ncontributions by a small group of very influential industrialists and\r\nfinanciers who, for selfish reasons, were anxious to “do everything in\r\nour power at all times to assist you “(Himmler)” in every possible way.”\r\nBy a rather strange coincidence, firms like I. G. Farben, the Flick\r\nCombine, and the Herman Goering Werke, which are on the list of\r\ncontributors to Himmler, were among the chief beneficiaries of the\r\nconspirators’ program of plunder of public and private property in the\r\noccupied countries.

THE WESTERN OCCUPIED COUNTRIES\r\n\r\n(This section is based on a brief originally prepared for submission by\r\nthe United States Prosecution in support of the allegation, in Count One\r\nof the Indictment, of a plan or conspiracy to commit war crimes. The\r\nevidence relating to the plan or conspiracy, however, proved to be\r\ninseparable from that on the execution thereof, a subject assigned to\r\nthe French Prosecution. The materials contained herein were accordingly\r\nmade available to the French for such use as they might deem appropriate\r\nin connection with the proof of their case.)\r\n\r\nA. _The Nazi Conspirators Obtained Enormous Quantities of Foodstuffs,\r\nRaw Materials and Equipment From the Occupied Western Countries._\r\n\r\n(1) _The Nazis planned in advance of the invasion to secure from the\r\nconquered territories the strategic materials which Germany lacked and\r\nwithout which Germany could not prevail in a war of long duration._ In\r\nthis war, as in the last, German resources were sufficient only for a\r\nconflict of short duration. As early as the winter of 1939-40, following\r\nthe swift and crushing defeat of Poland, Germany suffered from a\r\ncritical shortage of essential raw materials (_EC-615_). The Nazi\r\nleaders were thus faced with the question whether to conserve their\r\nsupplies for a long war or to commit their limited reserves in the hope\r\nof obtaining an early decision. Hitler decided on the latter course. As\r\nGoering told General Thomas:\r\n\r\n    “The Fuehrer is firmly convinced that he will succeed in\r\n    reaching a decision * * * in the year 1940 by a big attack in\r\n    the West. He reckons that Belgium, Holland, and Northern France\r\n    will get into our possession and * * * had figured out that the\r\n    industrial areas of Douai and Lens and those of Luxembourg,\r\n    Longwy, and Briey could, from the point of view of raw material,\r\n    replace the supplies from Sweden. Therefore, the Fuehrer had\r\n    decided now to make use of our reserve of raw materials without\r\n    regard to future times. * * *” (_EC-606_)\r\n\r\nCareful plans were made in advance of the invasion in 1940 to secure for\r\nGermany the raw material resources of the to-be-occupied countries. A\r\nmanual of directives and decrees issued by the Quartermaster, OKH, for\r\nthe economic administration of the military government set forth an\r\nexhaustive list of important raw materials to be seized wherever found\r\n(_EC-155_). Directives were issued to the so-called economic squads\r\n(_Wirtschafts Truppe_) attached to the tactical units on the procedures\r\nto be followed in locating, seizing, and preparing such materials for\r\nshipment to Germany (_EC-618_). Also included in the manual mentioned\r\nwere drafts of decrees to be promulgated by the German occupation\r\nauthorities, for the establishment in the occupied countries of Goods\r\nOffices, modeled after the German rationing boards, to control\r\nproduction and distribution in the occupied countries in the German\r\ninterest. (_EC-155_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The occupied Western countries were ruthlessly exploited according\r\nto plan._ The occupied areas were systematically stripped of their\r\neconomic resources to feed the German war machine. The extent of German\r\nexploitation is partially indicated by the staggering totals of the\r\noccupation levies and the “credit” balances of the local central banks\r\nunder clearing arrangements imposed by the Nazis, the principal sources\r\nof the funds with which Germany financed the spoliation of Western\r\nEurope. (For a brief explanation of the clearing system, see _infra_\r\nunder D, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe total occupation charges exacted from France alone were\r\n31,600,000,000 RM from 25 June, 1940, to 5 September, 1944 (_3615-PS_).\r\nThey averaged more than 7,000,000,000 RM annually, a sum more than four\r\ntimes the German annual payments under the Dawes and Young Plans. This\r\nsum is in addition to a “credit” of the Bank of France under the\r\nFranco-German clearing, which, as of September, 1943, amounted to\r\n4,400,000,000 RM (_3615-PS_). For the period May 1942-43, the tribute\r\nexacted from Belgium (mainly from occupation charges and clearing\r\ncredits) amounted to more than two-thirds of the Belgium national income\r\n(_ECR-149_). These figures, large as they are, take no account of the\r\nsubstantial quantities of materials seized and removed to the Reich\r\nwithout compensation (see _infra_ under B, (1)) nor do they reflect the\r\nwindfall to the Reich resulting from the substantial over-valuation of\r\nthe Reichsmark, particularly in the case of France and Belgium.\r\n(_EC-86_)\r\n\r\nA few illustrative examples of specific items, taken from the report of\r\nthe German Military Commander for France of 10 September, 1942\r\n(_EC-267_), will serve to show even more concretely than monetary\r\nfigures, the extent to which materials and equipment were taken from the\r\noccupied countries for the benefit of the Reich. Since the Armistice,\r\naccording to this report, the French contributed to the Germans 73\r\npercent of the normal annual French consumption of iron, amounting to\r\nnearly 5 million tons. From the Armistice to July, 1942, 225,000 tons of\r\ncopper and 5,700 tons of nickel were delivered by France to Germany,\r\namounting to 80 percent and 86 percent of French supplies respectively;\r\nalso 55 percent of the French aluminum and 80 percent of the magnesium\r\nproduction. For her own needs France retained only 30 percent of the\r\nnormal production of the wool industry, 16 percent of the cotton\r\nproduction, and 13 percent of the linen production. The total French\r\nproduction of locomotives and the major part of the machine tool\r\nindustry were put at the disposal of the Germans. (_EC-267_)\r\n\r\nB. _The Foodstuffs, Raw Materials and Equipment Delivered to Germany\r\nwere Obtained by Compelling the Nationals of the Conquered Countries to\r\nProduce and Distribute in Accordance with German War Requirements, by\r\nSeizure and Requisition, and by Purchases Financed with Funds Exacted\r\nfrom the Occupied Countries and Their Nationals._\r\n\r\n(1) _Much of the material and equipment removed to Germany was obtained\r\nby seizure, requisition, and confiscation of private property._ During\r\nthe first phase of the occupation, the Nazis systematically removed to\r\nthe Reich almost all available supplies to satisfy the immediate German\r\nrequirements. This phase, according to the German Military Commander’s\r\ndescription of the practice in France, was one of “stripping” occupied\r\nareas of “foodstuffs, raw materials and machinery”, leaving only enough\r\nto secure the “bare subsistence” of the population (_EC-614_). In the\r\nwords of the report of the Wi-Rue Staff in France:\r\n\r\n    “In this period the legal concepts of the Hague Regulations\r\n    regarding Land Warfare are not yet strictly observed. The main\r\n    purpose is to get out of France through seizure _Beschlagnahme_\r\n    or purchase at infinitesimal prices the materials of use for the\r\n    German armament.” (_EC-422_)\r\n\r\nBy order of the German High Command, booty was defined to include not\r\nmerely public property but “beyond the Hague Regulations on Land\r\nWarfare,” also “privately owned finished and semi-finished products if\r\nthey were manufactured in fulfillment of an order of the French armed\r\nforces” (_EC-422_). At the same time, payments made by the French armed\r\nforces on account of war material orders were likewise treated as war\r\nbooty. Even goods in transit were arbitrarily placed in this category\r\n(_EC-422_). Machinery and equipment affixed to the realty were seized\r\nand shipped to Germany in wilful disregard of the limitations of the\r\nHague Regulations authorizing seizure only of chattels. (_EC-84_)\r\n\r\nThe “stripping phase” of Nazi spoliation was relatively short-lived.\r\nDecision was soon reached to utilize at least part of the industrial\r\ncapacity of the occupied areas to relieve the burden on the armament\r\nplants in Germany (_EC-620_). Throughout the period of occupation,\r\nhowever, the Nazis continued the seizure and requisition of machinery\r\nand certain raw materials in short supply in the Reich. From December,\r\n1942, to the end of the occupation, for example, 242 German demands for\r\nBelgian machinery were met, of which 110 were fulfilled by requisitions\r\n(_ECH-10_). In 79 instances the requisitioned equipment was shipped to\r\nGermany. (_ECH-10_)\r\n\r\nSupport for such requisitions was found in an order of the Military\r\nCommander of Belgium of 6 August 1942. This order was explained as\r\nembodying the “modern” German view that, as “total war is no longer\r\nlimited in space but has become a struggle of peoples and nations\r\nagainst each other,” requisitions under Article 52 of the Hague\r\nRegulations should no longer be limited to the “needs of the occupying\r\nforces” but may also be used in the “general interest of the German war\r\neffort”; and that requisitioned articles may be used not only in the\r\nterritory in which they were obtained but also “in other territories in\r\nthe sphere of the occupying power.” (_ECH-10_)\r\n\r\nIn April 1941, Goering ordered the removal of church bells in France\r\n“which represent the most important and last reserve of copper and tin,”\r\nstressing that “no church bells would be removed in Germany before all\r\nbells had been removed in France” (_EC-323_). In 1943, after the removal\r\nof church bells from the other occupied countries and even from the\r\nReich, Hitler ordered their removal from Belgium (_ECH-11_). The\r\nBelgians protested, invoking the Hague Regulations, and refused an offer\r\nto buy; thereupon the Germans requisitioned the bells against receipt.\r\n(_ECH-11_)\r\n\r\nBy circular letter, dated 23 June 1943, Speer ordered that scientific\r\ninstruments and apparatus be taken out of the laboratories and research\r\ninstitutes in the occupied Western countries, directing that\r\napplications for instruments be made through channels and that the\r\nrequisitions be made by the Military Government. (_ECH-14_)\r\n\r\nIn many cases, representatives of German scientific institutions sought\r\nto acquire scientific instruments in order to modernize their own\r\ninstallations, appearing in Army uniforms to give the impression that\r\nthe requisition was a military measure (_ECH-15_). The Military\r\nGovernment of Belgium decided that Articles 52 and 56 of the Hague\r\nRegulations were inapplicable because the Allies had destroyed a number\r\nof German scientific installations in the Reich through bombing, which\r\ntherefore had to be replaced from the occupied territories, and that “in\r\na total war, no consideration could be given to the cited articles of\r\nthe Hague Regulations”. (_ECH-16_)\r\n\r\nAs part of the design to supply the armament industry in Germany with\r\nmaterial from the occupied Western territories, a program for the\r\nremoval of copper and lead from transmission installations of power\r\ndistribution plants in the occupied Western countries was instituted by\r\na decree of Speer dated 31 May, 1943 (_EC-101_). The plan contemplated\r\nfrom the outset that the transmission of facilities would not be\r\nrestored (as required by the second paragraph of Article 53 of the Hague\r\nRegulations) but that an equivalent amount of metal would be returned\r\nafter the war. (_EC-101_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Nazis purchased war materials and consumer goods_ _in the\r\nregular and black markets for shipment to the Reich, all with funds\r\nexacted from the occupied countries._ Following the initial “stripping”\r\nphase of the occupation, the Nazis promptly instituted an extensive\r\n“buying-out” program (_061-PS_) with the object of procuring not merely\r\nmaterials required for the German war effort, but to obtain also\r\nconsumer goods, including luxury items, for the civilian population of\r\nGermany (_EC-485_).\r\n\r\nNo limitations, legal or moral, were observed in the execution of this\r\nprogram. Supplies which could not be obtained through normal channels\r\nwere purchased on the black market. The disastrous effects of\r\ncompetition among various German agents led the central occupational\r\nauthorities in Belgium, France, and Holland to take over black market\r\noperation directly (_1765-PS_). On 13 June 1942, by order of Goering,\r\nCol. Veltjens was appointed to direct black market purchases in all\r\noccupied territories and a new agency, the so-called UEWA, was placed at\r\nhis disposal. (_ECH-7_)\r\n\r\nThe actual purchases were made by several corporations, including\r\nPimetex, an agency of the Speer Ministry of Armament and Munitions. The\r\ngoods were distributed through Roges according to directives of the\r\nCentral Planning Board (Speer, Koerner, Milch) and in appropriate cases\r\nby the German Ministry of Economics and the _Reichsstellen_ (_ECH-7_).\r\nBlack market operations were finally abolished by order of Goering dated\r\n2 April, 1943, confirmed in Belgium by circular of the Military\r\nCommander of 19 June, 1943. (_ECH-9_)\r\n\r\nCertain of the purchases made through the black market while under the\r\ndirection of Col. Veltjens are of special interest:\r\n\r\n    _Christmas Drive._ On 22 September 1942, Goering ordered a\r\n    special drive in the Western occupied countries to purchase\r\n    presents for the civil population in Germany for the coming\r\n    Christmas. The Roges Company effected the distribution of the\r\n    articles in Germany.\r\n\r\n    _Special Drive WABO._ This drive was pursuant to Hitler’s order\r\n    to Speer to procure Christmas packages for the soldiers. The O.\r\n    Todt Cantine accepted offers of sale on the black market and\r\n    Pimetex did the buying.\r\n\r\n    _Special Drive LOWA_ (Degenkolb locomotive program). The\r\n    purchase were made by Pimetex. (_ECH-7_)\r\n\r\nAs of 15 January 1943, black market purchases totaled approximately\r\n1,100,000,000 RM, including:\r\n\r\n    RM 929,100,000 in France.\r\n\r\n    RM 103,881,929 in Belgium, and\r\n\r\n    RM 73,685,162.64 in Holland. (_1765-PS_)\r\n\r\nPayment in France was made out of occupation funds, in Belgium out of\r\nsuch funds and through the clearing, and in Holland through “normal bank\r\ntransactions” (_1765-PS_; _ECR-132_). As appears very clearly from the\r\nreport of Col. Veltjens of 15 January, 1943, substantially all the goods\r\nso purchased were shipped to the Reich. (_1765-PS_)\r\n\r\n(3) _The Nazi conspirators compelled the nationals of the occupied\r\ncountries to produce and distribute materials and equipment in\r\naccordance with the German general war requirements._ The “stripping”\r\nand “buying-out” phases of the Nazi spoliation were both gradually\r\nsuperseded by a regulated program for the utilization of the industrial\r\nplant of the occupied areas and the transfer of orders (subcontracting)\r\nto local concerns. The Nazi conspirators established comprehensive\r\nrationing controls under which essential raw materials were made\r\navailable only to those who produced in the German interest; those\r\nreluctant to produce on German order were placed under compulsory\r\nadministration. “This,” Keitel noted in commenting on the controls\r\nestablished in France, “is * * * booty of the victor”. (_EC-613_)\r\n\r\n                               _Belgium_\r\n\r\nThe means employed in Belgium were typical. Production quotas for coal,\r\niron and steel, textiles and leather, and other products were fixed by\r\nthe Ministry of Economics and its _Reichsstellen_, in some cases after\r\nconsultation with the Reich Minister (Funk). (_ECH-2_)\r\n\r\nComprehensive production controls were established in Belgium to assure\r\nthe fulfillment of these quotas. Pursuant to plans developed in advance\r\nof the invasion (_EC-155_), a decree was issued by the Military\r\nCommander on 27 May, 1940, creating so-called “Goods Offices,” endowed\r\nwith authority to issue general and special orders to Belgian firms\r\nrequiring production of designated products, and the sale thereof to\r\ndesignated buyers, and with the further power to prohibit production or\r\nsale without license (_3604-PS_). By decree of the Military Commander of\r\n29 April, 1941, the appointment of a commissar to direct operations of\r\nprivate plants was authorized. (_3610-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe German Goods Offices (_ECH-3_) were transferred to similar units\r\nestablished by Belgian decree of 3 September, 1940. (Whether this decree\r\nwas issued on German order or suggestion does not appear.) The Germans\r\nsupervised the Belgian Goods Offices and adopted as German orders both\r\nthe Belgian decree establishing the Offices and the orders issued\r\nthereunder, and prescribed punishment by fine and imprisonment for\r\nviolations. (_3609-PS_)\r\n\r\nFor the first two years of the occupation, German control was exercised\r\nmainly through prohibitions and restrictions, that is, by a priority\r\nsystem (_ECH-4_), although even then important sectors of the Belgian\r\neconomy, notably textiles and leather products, were controlled by\r\n“positive” orders directing the amount in kind to be produced and the\r\npersons to whom distribution must be made (_ECH-4_; _ECH-2_). During\r\nthis period the Military Commander issued instructions to the Goods\r\nOffices through “command channels,” that is, through the Belgian\r\nMinister of Economics. (_ECH-3_)\r\n\r\nOn 6 August, 1942, the Military Commander, however, published a decree\r\nreaffirming explicitly the power to compel production of designated\r\narticles (_3612-PS_), a signal for the introduction of “positive”\r\ncontrols. In 1943, on instructions from the Reich Ministry of Economics,\r\nGerman representatives selected from the _Reichsstellen_ were attached\r\ndirectly to the Belgian Goods Offices (_ECH-3_). At the end of 1943, the\r\noffice of the “Ruestungsobmann” of the Speer Ministry for Armaments and\r\nWar Production began issuing “positive orders” for production to\r\nindividual concerns directly, without clearing with the Goods Offices,\r\npursuant to decree of the Minister for Armaments and War Production\r\n(Speer). (_ECH-3_)\r\n\r\nProduction facilities in Belgium which were not deemed to serve the\r\nGerman interest were shut down. By order of 30 March 1942, the Military\r\nCommander prohibited the enlargement of existing plants and the\r\nconstruction of new ones without German authorization, and provided for\r\nthe closing down of factories at his discretion (_3616-PS_). In the iron\r\nand metal industry alone at least 400 plants “not important for the war\r\neffort” had been closed down by 15 April 1943 (_EC-335_). By the end of\r\nthe occupation, 1360 put of a total of 2164 plants in the textile\r\nindustry had been closed down. (_ECH-19_)\r\n\r\n                          _France and Holland_\r\n\r\nSubstantially the same system was put into effect in France and Holland.\r\nGerman Goods Offices were established in Occupied France at the same\r\ntime as in Belgium (_3604-PS_). These were subsequently abolished in\r\nNovember, 1940, however, when the Vichy Government, at the “suggestion”\r\nof the Nazis, created raw material rationing boards, on which delegates\r\nof the German Military Administration served as technical advisers\r\n(_EC-613_; _EC-616_). In the Netherlands, controls were exercised by the\r\nlocal German Armament Inspectorate (_EC-471_; _EC-472-A_), who, it is\r\nbelieved, made use of the rationing boards set up in Holland before the\r\noutbreak of war.\r\n\r\nC. _The Nazi Conspirators Acquired Ownership of Belgian, Dutch, and\r\nFrench Participations in European Industries by Means of Governmental\r\nPressure and Through the Use of Funds Unlawfully Exacted from the\r\nOccupied Countries and Their Nationals._\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators were not content with securing for Germany the\r\nsupplies necessary for the period of the war. They aimed at obtaining\r\npermanent ownership and domination of European industry to the fullest\r\nextent possible, and embarked on a program to that end even during the\r\nprogress of the war.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Nazi conspirators established a program to acquire for German\r\ninterests ownership of Belgian, Dutch, and French participations during\r\nthe war._ On 23 May 1940, recommendation was made that it would be\r\nopportune to secure all Dutch and Belgian stocks “in order, especially\r\nin the case of holding companies, to win influence * * * over the\r\ncontrolled companies” (_EC-41_). The memorandum recommended the taking\r\npossession of stocks of the dominated companies located in foreign\r\ncountries and influencing the decisions of members of holding companies\r\nlocated in Holland and Belgium or of other owners of such stock. Because\r\nof the provisions of Article 46 of the Hague Regulations prohibiting\r\nconfiscation of private property, it was deemed more advisable to\r\ninfluence members of holding companies through careful guiding than\r\nthrough plain force. (_EC-41_)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held in the Reich Ministry of Economics on 3 June 1940 on\r\nthe subject of “Belgian and Dutch capital shares in southeastern\r\nEuropean countries,” it was decided that regulations should be issued\r\nimmediately by the Military Commander for Belgium prohibiting the\r\ndestruction, transfer, or disposition of any bonds or stocks of these\r\ncountries, and that registration should be required of owners and\r\ntrustees. (_1445-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum of 2 August 1940 Goering declared that the goal of the\r\nGermans’ economic policy was the “increase of German influence with\r\nforeign enterprises,” that it was “necessary already now that any\r\nopportunity is used to make it possible for the German economy to start\r\nthe penetration even during the war of the interesting objects of the\r\neconomy of the occupied countries,” and directed that the transfer of\r\ncapital from Germany to the occupied countries be facilitated to make\r\npossible the immediate purchase of enterprises in the occupied\r\ncountries. (_EC-137_)\r\n\r\nAt a meeting at the Reich Ministry of Economics on 8 August 1940 on the\r\nsubject of “Acquisition of shares of important foreign enterprises in\r\nsoutheastern Europe,” Dr. Schlotterer of the Reich Ministry of Economics\r\ncommented that “private economical penetration of the Southeast area by\r\nGerman influence is desirable, likewise the supplanting of British and\r\nFrench interests in that territory” (_EC-43_). The group present,\r\nincluding representatives of the Reich Ministry of Economics and the\r\nReichsbank, agreed that “attempts should be made immediately to acquire\r\nshares” and that “in doing so the tendency should be preserved to\r\npresent a bill for the shares at the peace conference.” It was further\r\nagreed that “it should be attempted if possible to transfer the shares\r\ninto private hands” but that “in order to make the right selection it\r\nappears necessary to introduce an intermediary stage” in which “first of\r\nall, enterprises should be taken over through banks, thereupon the\r\nplants should be managed as a matter of trusteeship for the Reich with\r\nthe aim that the Reich (Reich Marshal Goering)” undertake handing them\r\nover to private industry. (_EC-43_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Nazi conspirators carried out this program by compulsory sale\r\nwhere necessary and by purchases financed out of occupation charges and\r\nunder clearing agreements with the occupied countries._\r\n\r\n                               _Belgium_\r\n\r\nImmediate steps were taken to implement these measures in Belgium. The\r\nannual report of the Commissar at the National Bank from May 1940-41\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    “According to the directions of the Reichsmarshal Goering as\r\n    early as September 1940 the first measures for a closer\r\n    formation of capital ties between the Belgian and German economy\r\n    were taken. Two different procedures were concerned here:\r\n\r\n    “1. Direct negotiations between German industrialists and\r\n    Belgian industrialists, for the purpose of obtaining\r\n    constructive participations in important Belgian enterprises\r\n    which offer the basis for collaboration between the two\r\n    economies even after the war. Furthermore, it is desired to\r\n    transfer to German hands important Belgian participations in\r\n    foreign enterprises whose administration is located in Belgium,\r\n    particularly so far as enterprises are concerned which are\r\n    located in the Balkans and in which a general German interest\r\n    exists.\r\n\r\n    “2. Ties which result from purchases of stock by German parties\r\n    on the Belgian stock markets. For this purpose the Reich\r\n    Economic Minister has given general permission to 32 German\r\n    banks to obtain participation rights, particularly stocks, in a\r\n    limited quantity in Belgium. Till now use has been made of this\r\n    permission in the amount of about 25 million RM, to which can be\r\n    added an additional 10 million RM for the procurement of Belgian\r\n    participations in Rumania, Bulgaria, and the former Poland.”\r\n    (_ECR-24_)\r\n\r\nIn his report for November 1940 the Military Commander for Belgium\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “A certain readiness exists on the part of the Belgians to give\r\n    up investments in stocks in such countries which, at the present\r\n    time, are being ruled militarily or economically by Germany.\r\n    Among the important business deals of this kind which have been\r\n    concluded should be mentioned the taking over by the\r\n    _Kreditanstalt, Wien_ (Credit Institute, Vienna) of an essential\r\n    interest in the _Allgemeiner Jugoslawischer Bankverein_ (General\r\n    Yugoslav Bank Association) from the _Societé Generale_ (capital\r\n    approximately 1 million RM) and the taking over by the _Deutsche\r\n    Bank_ of the overwhelming majority [translator’s note: of\r\n    shares] of the _Banca Commerciala Romana_ from the _Societé\r\n    Generale_ (capital approximately 2 million RM). The _Deutsche\r\n    Bank_ also succeeded in acquiring shares of the _Kreditanstalt,\r\n    Wien_, of approximately 800,000 RM nominally from the _Societé\r\n    Generale_ and from one of its subsidiaries. Negotiations between\r\n    the _Deutsche Bank_ and the _Societé Generale_ on the transfer\r\n    of approximately 25% of the capital of the _Banque Generale du\r\n    Luxembourg_ are about to be concluded. Through this deal the\r\n    _Deutsche Bank_ together with the other German groups obtains\r\n    the absolute majority of the Luxembourger Bank (approximately\r\n    70% of the shares). The _Deutsche Bank_ gets the right to\r\n    acquire another 25% of the shares which for the time being,\r\n    remained with the _Societé Generale_.” (_EC-34_)\r\n\r\nWhile the Military Commander of Belgium may have given some assurance\r\nthat the owners would not be compelled to sell (_ECH-22_), in at least\r\none instance, purchase could be effected only by military order\r\n(_EC-335_). In this instance the procurement for the Main Branch of\r\nTrustees East of shares of the Belgian “Trust Metallurgique” in\r\nelectricity and road enterprises of East Silesia and the General\r\nGovernment, as well as purchase of shares in the iron works Ostrovica\r\nfor the Reichswerk Hermann Goering had “to be done, at the request of\r\nthe Reich Ministry for Economics, forcibly, as an agreement on a\r\nfinancial basis could not be obtained.” (_EC-335_)\r\n\r\nThe German acquisition of Belgian stock participations was financed\r\nthrough the Belgium-German clearing. The Belgian clearing balances of 20\r\nMarch 1940 included an item of 296 millions bfrs., which “is explained\r\nby out-payment of large clearing transfers to purchase Belgian capital\r\nparticipations in Balkan enterprises” (_ECR-14_). Increasing transfers\r\nresulting from the German capital penetration program precipitated a\r\ncontroversy with the Emission Bank, which was resolved by the\r\nCommissar’s issuance of an order requiring the bank to make payment\r\n(_ECR-24_). As a sequel, “capital” payments were separated from those\r\nfor “goods and services” and financed by a separate “capital” clearing\r\nagreement covering purchases of securities and other “capital”\r\ntransactions (_ECR-24_). The Belgian clearing “credit” under the capital\r\nclearing, as of 31 July 1943, amounted to 1,071,000,000 bfrs\r\n(_ECR-173_). As shown below, (see _infra_, D, 2) the Belgian credit\r\nunder the capital clearing traffic represents a forced loan, exacted for\r\na purpose not even remotely related to the needs of the occupation army.\r\n\r\n                          _France and Holland_\r\n\r\nThe limited evidence, in the presently available German documents\r\nindicates that similar methods were employed in French and Dutch\r\nparticipations. The procedure followed in the Netherlands is indicated\r\nbelow in the discussion of the removal of restrictions on the free\r\ntransfer of Reichsmarks in that country. (See _infra_, D, 5.) In France,\r\nparticipations of a value of 121,000,000 RM were purchased for German\r\ninterests, paid for in part out of occupation funds and in part through\r\nthe clearing. (_1991-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _The Nazi Conspirators Compelled the Occupied Countries and Their\r\nNationals to Furnish the Monetary Requirements for the German\r\nExploitation, by Means of Occupation Levies, Forced Loans, and the\r\nRequisition of Gold and Foreign Exchange in Amounts Far in Excess of the\r\nNeeds of the Occupation Armies._\r\n\r\nExcept for the early period of the occupation, during which\r\n_Reichskreditkassen_ certificates were issued to finance the needs of\r\nthe occupation troops (Lemkin, _Axis Rule In Occupied Europe_, p. 329),\r\nthe Nazis obtained the necessary local currency through the levy of\r\nexcessive occupation charges, the imposition of clearing arrangements\r\nunder which the local central banks were compelled to finance exports to\r\nthe Reich, and by requisition of gold and foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Nazi conspirators exacted excessive occupation charges from the\r\nconquered countries._\r\n\r\n                               _Belgium_\r\n\r\nThe Nazi conspirators demanded from Belgium both “internal occupation\r\ncosts” and “external occupation costs” (_ECR-32_). The former was\r\ndefined as “those sums which are gotten out of the country to finance\r\nthe needs of the German military formations located in the country”\r\n(_ECR-32_). The term “external occupation costs” was used\r\ninterchangeably with the title “antibolshevistic contribution”\r\n(_EC-401_). Under whatever theory, the exaction of occupation charges\r\nwas made “to the limit of capacity”. (_ECR-59_)\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of German occupation, a substantial part of the\r\ncontribution charges obtained from Belgium was used as a matter of\r\nregular practice “not for occupation cost purposes” (_ECR-166_;\r\n_ECR-155-A_; _ECR-35_), including:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Exports to Germany, Holland, and France (_ECR-89_; _ECR-104_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Exchange for Belgian francs of RKK certificates, a “not\r\ninconsiderable part” of which did “not have the least thing to do with\r\noccupation costs” (_ECR-39_; _ECR-142_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) “Political purposes (that is, SS, Propaganda, Hitler Youth)”\r\n(_ECR-106_).\r\n\r\n(_d_) Purchases in the “black market” (_ECR-106_), many of them destined\r\nfor export.

It is certain, however, that large sums were\r\nexpended for such purposes. Thus, a communication of the OKW to the\r\nForeign Office of 6 November 1942, explaining the decrease in reserve\r\nfor Account B, states:\r\n\r\n    “In addition, payments to a considerable extent had to be made\r\n    from the occupation cost funds which were not allotted to meet\r\n    the demands of those units of the German Wehrmacht stationed in\r\n    France.

RM on 15 January 1942 is\r\n    primarily due to expenditures for purposes unrelated to the\r\n    occupation.” (_1741-PS_)\r\n\r\n                               _Holland_\r\n\r\nOccupation charges were fixed at about 100,000,000 gulden a month\r\n(_ECR-174_; _EC-86_). (100 RM = 75 gulden, approximately (_EC-468_)).\r\n\r\nExpenditures were divided between “occupation” purposes and\r\n“nonoccupation” purposes, according to whether “the products purchased\r\nor produced on orders of the armed forces of the Netherlands remain in\r\nthe Netherlands (occupation cost) or leave the Netherlands\r\n(nonoccupation cost)” (_ECR-174_). During the 20-month period from March\r\n1941 to October 1942, inclusive (the only period for which figures are\r\navailable), out of the total occupation charges of 1,545,500,000 gulden,\r\n433,800,000 gulden were expended for “nonoccupation” purposes\r\n(_ECR-175-193_). A large part of the “pure” occupation expenditure,\r\nmoreover, was for general war expenses, including the construction of\r\nfortifications and airfields, and the letting of shipbuilding contracts.\r\n(_ECR-180, 181, 183, 187, 191_)\r\n\r\nIn theory, only the “occupation” costs were supposed to be charged to\r\nthe Netherlands (_ECR-174_); until April 1941, the “nonoccupation”\r\nexpenditures were returned to the Military Commander in the Netherlands\r\n(_ECR-175_). The claim of the Netherlands to the sums “returned,”\r\nhowever, was rejected. Moreover, as appears from the above cited reports\r\n(_ECR-175-193_), nonoccupation expenditure continued even after April\r\n1941, when reimbursements ceased. (_ECR-176_)\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the occupation Germany exacted an additional\r\nlevy from the Netherlands under the heading of “external occupation\r\ncosts,” amounting to 500,000,000 RM (_ECR-194_). Of this sum,\r\n100,000,000 RM was paid in gold; the remainder was paid by a transfer of\r\nthe clearing balance of the Netherlands Bank at the _Verrechnungskasse_\r\nto the German Ministry of Finance, that is, was used to reduce a credit\r\nwhich arose by reason of exports to the Reich. (_ECR-194_)\r\n\r\nIn April 1942, “at the instigation of the Reich Commissioner\r\nSeyss-Inquart,” the Netherlands began to pay a “voluntary contribution\r\nto the war against Bolshevism” of 50,000,000 guilders per month,\r\nretroactive to 1 July 1941, of which 10,000,000 per month was paid in\r\ngold (_ECR-195_). By 31 March 1944, this “contribution” amounted to\r\n2,150,000,000 RM. (_EC-86_)\r\n\r\nIt is immaterial whether this “contribution” was made at the direction\r\nof Seyss-Inquart or was in fact the “voluntary” act of the then\r\nPresident of the Netherlands Bank and Treasurer in the Ministry of\r\nFinance, Van Tonningen. Van Tonningen was appointed by Seyss-Inquart and\r\nacted in the German interest. His acts, like that of civilian\r\nadministrators in occupied territories generally, must be charged to the\r\noccupant. (See _infra_, _Conclusion_.) The spirit in which he discharged\r\nhis duties is sympathetically described by the German Commissar at the\r\nNetherlands Bank as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The new President of the Netherlands Bank, Mr. Rost Van\r\n    Tonningen, is, in contrast to a large part of the leadership,\r\n    penetrated in his movements and his official acts by the greater\r\n    German thought, and convinced of the necessity of the creation\r\n    of a greater European economic space. This ideological attitude\r\n    in itself gives him the correct position on financial and\r\n    monetary policy questions for his country in relation to the\r\n    greater German economic space. Furthermore, it makes easier\r\n    cooperation with my office, a fact which deserves special\r\n    mention in consideration of the frequently observed passive\r\n    conduct of the Netherlands agencies before the entrance into\r\n    office of the new President. I consider as a fortunate solution\r\n    the fact that the Reichskommissar for the Occupied Dutch Areas\r\n    has also entrusted Mr. Rost Van Tonningen with the Treasury of\r\n    the Ministry of Finance (_Schatzamt des Finanzministeriums_).\r\n    Mr. Rost Van Tonningen took over this office at the end of the\r\n    month of April. Thus there is a guarantee that the financial and\r\n    monetary policy of the country will be conducted according to\r\n    unified points of view.” (_ECR-196_)\r\n\r\n(2) _The Nazi conspirators financed exports from the occupied countries\r\nto Germany by means of forced loans under the guise of clearing\r\nagreements._\r\n\r\n                               _Belgium_\r\n\r\nThe principle of the clearing system is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe importer makes a deposit of the purchase price in his own currency\r\nat the national clearing agency of his country, which places the same\r\namount to the credit of the clearing agency of the exporting country.\r\nThe latter institution then pays the exporter in his own currency. Thus\r\nif trade between two countries is unequal the clearing agency of one\r\nacquires a claim against the agency of the other which, however, is\r\nsatisfied only when a shift in the balance of trade gives rise to an\r\noffsetting claim.\r\n\r\nIn the order establishing the German-Belgium clearing, the Belgium\r\nclearing agency was the National Bank of Belgium (_3608-PS_). The\r\nadministration of the clearing was shortly thereafter transferred to\r\nEmission Bank, an organization originally incorporated by Belgian\r\ninterests pursuant to order of the Military Commander of 27 June 1940\r\n(_ECR-24_). The change was one in name only, however, since at this time\r\nthe management of the two banks was substantially identical and the\r\nEmission Bank obtained its currency by loan from the National Bank. The\r\nEmission Bank was, by its charter terms, subject to orders of the\r\nCommissar at the National Bank; the Commissar obtained the same powers\r\nover the National Bank by German order of 16 December 1940. (_ECR-24_)\r\n\r\nThe Belgian total “credit” under the clearing, as of 31 July 1944,\r\namounted to 60,837,000,000 bfrs = 4,867,000,000 RM, of which\r\n54,993,000,000 bfrs = 4,399,000,000 RM arose from the Belgian-German\r\nclearing for goods and services. (_ECR-173_)\r\n\r\nThe continued increase in the Belgian “credit” was due mainly to “the\r\nincreasing Belgian export to Germany for which there are only small\r\nimports from Germany on the other side of the account.” (_ECR-149_)\r\n\r\nThe entire Belgian credit under the clearing constitutes a forced loan,\r\nlargely for nonoccupation purposes:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Belgian-German clearing was established by circular of the\r\nReichs Minister of Economics, 4 July 1940 (_ECH-6_), which was published\r\nto the Belgians by proclamation of the Military Commander of 10 July\r\n1940 (_EC-604_; _3608-PS_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) “Since it was to be foreseen that as the result of the increased\r\ndeliveries from Belgium to the Reich, which were not matched by opposite\r\naccounts, particularly in the early period, the clearing status would\r\ndevelop to the favor of the Emission Bank” (_ECR-24_), an agreement was\r\nsigned by the Emission Bank and the German Reichsbank on 16/17 August\r\n1940 under which each undertook to pay out clearing transfers\r\nimmediately (_ECR-24_; _ECH-5_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) This agreement did not prescribe what must be financed through the\r\nclearing; it merely provided for immediate payment of claim arising\r\nthereunder without waiting until the account should be balanced by\r\nequalizing of imports and exports. As the Military Commander stated, the\r\nGerman-Belgian clearing was “not regulated by an agreement, but has been\r\nregulated unilaterally by my proclamation of 10 July 1940” (_EC-604_).\r\nThe Military Commander made clear the absolute power asserted by the\r\nGerman authorities over the Belgian Note Banks (as the Germans described\r\nthe Emission and National Banks). He stated:\r\n\r\n    “* * * The claim made to the Commissar that the Emission Bank is\r\n    entitled to ask in every case for detailed explanation of\r\n    compensation payments coming from Germany is incorrect. The\r\n    clearing activities between Germany and Belgium are not\r\n    regulated by an agreement but have been regulated unilaterally\r\n    by my proclamation on July 10, 1940 and are not subject to any\r\n    Belgian control. Inter-alia the transfer of all payments which\r\n    have been specially authorized by the Reich Ministry of Economy\r\n    has been expressly permitted * * *.” (_EC-604_)\r\n\r\n(_d_) The Commissar freely invoked his directive power over the Note\r\nBanks.\r\n\r\n    1. When, in April 1941, the clearing balance of the Emission\r\n    Bank exceeded 1,500,000 bfrs the Emission Bank refused to pay\r\n    out several large sums arising by virtue of German-Belgian\r\n    “capital” transactions. Thereupon, the Commissar issued an order\r\n    directing the bank to make the payment. (_ECR-24_)\r\n\r\n    2. In December 1941, the Emission Bank refused to pay out a sum\r\n    of 43,256,000 RM transferred from Paris. The Commissar thereupon\r\n    issued an order directing the bank to do so. (_ECR-172_)\r\n\r\n    3. In October 1942, the Emission Bank refused to pay out certain\r\n    amounts expended for purchases on the Belgian black market. The\r\n    military administrator, however, “held down the increasing\r\n    resistance of the Note Banks which culminated at the end of\r\n    October of this year in a public threat of resignation by the\r\n    Governor of the National Bank, by the heaviest pressure, and\r\n    forced the Note Banks, while emphasizing his willingness to\r\n    negotiate on certain Belgian proposals, again to take up the\r\n    global clearing transfers for German procurement agencies which\r\n    were cut off for a period” (_ECR-132_). The nature of this\r\n    pressure is explicitly shown in the following communication from\r\n    the Commissar to the President of the Emission Bank dated 29\r\n    October 1942:\r\n\r\n    “The Military Commander has ordered me to inform you of the\r\n    following:\r\n\r\n    “The requested extension of time for the resumption of business\r\n    relations with the Armed Forces Clearing Institute\r\n    (_Wehrmachtverrechnungskasse_) and for the payment of the\r\n    arrears of RM 60 million have been denied. An official will\r\n    determine tomorrow at 10 a. m. whether payment has been made.\r\n\r\n    “Severest measures against you and all responsible parties must\r\n    be expected in case of failure to pay.\r\n\r\n    “If acts of sabotage occur on the equipment and the values of\r\n    the National Bank or the Emission Bank, you and the gentlemen\r\n    designated on the enclosed list will be held responsible\r\n    personally and your property will be seized. Your liability is a\r\n    joint one.” (_EC-605_)\r\n\r\n                                _France_\r\n\r\nThe “credit” balance of the Bank of France under the Franco-German\r\nclearing established on 14 November 1940 amounted to 4,400,000,000 RM as\r\nof September 1943 (_3615-PS_). The clearing arrangement was designed, of\r\ncourse, principally for the financing of exports, that is, for purposes\r\nnot related to the needs of the occupation army. (_EC-619_)\r\n\r\nCoercion in the establishment of the Franco-German clearing is readily\r\ndemonstrable. Extreme pressure was brought to bear, particularly in\r\nregard to the rate of exchange established in the agreement, by\r\nthreatening to cut off communications between “occupied” and\r\n“nonoccupied” zones in France (_3602-PS_; _3603-PS_), a step which would\r\nhave destroyed the last vestige of economic order in France. The harsh\r\nterms of the agreement, which required the Bank of France to make\r\nimmediate payment for exports to Germany regardless of the balance of\r\ntrade, fixed the rate of exchange at 20 francs to the mark (as compared\r\nto 10 to 1 before the war), and gave Germany a unilateral option to\r\ncancel at any time, forcibly suggest that the agreement would not\r\nvoluntarily have been accepted. (_EC-619_)\r\n\r\n                               _Holland_\r\n\r\nThe clearing system between Holland and Germany was of short duration,\r\nbeing cancelled effective 1 April 1941, when free transfer of\r\nReichsmarks to Holland was introduced. (See _infra_, D, (5).) It is\r\ntherefore not deemed of sufficient importance to warrant discussion at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Nazi conspirators unlawfully took over the gold reserve of the\r\nNational Bank of Belgium and the Netherlands Bank in the interest of the\r\nGerman general war effort._\r\n\r\n                               _Belgium_\r\n\r\nThe gold of the National Bank, deposited with the Bank of France and\r\ntransferred to Dakar, was brought to Berlin pursuant to German-French\r\n“agreement” in the amount of 545,700,000 RM (_ECR-149_), and there\r\ndeposited with the Reichsbank in Berlin (_ECR-24_). Because of the “high\r\ndemands on gold and foreign exchange” which led to a “considerable\r\nstraining of the reserves” (_EC-401_), the “Reich Government felt itself\r\nrequired to lay claim to the gold of the National Bank for the Reich”\r\n(_ECR-149_). A decision to proceed by requisitioning under paragraph 52\r\nof the Hague Regulations (_EC-401_) was not executed, apparently because\r\nof fears on the part of the Reichsbank that title thus acquired would\r\nnot be recognized (_ECR-115_).

(_EC-465_)\r\n\r\n                                _France_\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the same practice was followed in France, but\r\nevidence as to details has not been found in the German documents\r\npresently available.\r\n\r\n(5) _The Nazi conspirators used German Reichsmarks as currency in the\r\nNetherlands, for purposes unrelated to the needs of the occupational\r\ntroops, which currency they caused to be freely exchanged for gulden by\r\nthe Netherlands Bank._ The Nazi conspirators, animated in part by the\r\nview that the Netherlands were “akin in blood to the German nation”\r\n(_3613-PS_), sought to promote a “mutual interpenetration of the German\r\nand Netherlands economies” through the acquisition by Germans of Dutch\r\nparticipations (_EC-468_) and Dutch investment in German securities.\r\n(_ECR-174_)\r\n\r\nTo this end, restrictions on the free transfer of Reichsmark and gulden\r\nacross the German-Dutch border were removed. Conversations between the\r\nReich Economics and Finance Ministers in October 1940 led to the first\r\nstep in this direction, the issuance by the Economics Minister of a\r\nCircular (_Runderlass_)—No. 89/40—which produced substantial changes\r\nin the foreign exchange control along the German-Dutch borders\r\n(_EC-468_). This provided, _inter-alia_, that RM 1,000 or its equivalent\r\nin gulden could be taken across the German-Dutch border by travelers or\r\nin border trade without permit, and permitted Germans to transfer to\r\nHolland up to 5,000 RM per person per month for any purpose except\r\npurchase of goods without any permission (_EC-468_).\r\n\r\nThese relaxations were made effective in Holland by free exchange of\r\nReichsmarks for gulden by the Netherlands Bank, introduced “on the\r\ninitiative” of the Commissar, and by enforced acceptance of Reichsmark\r\ncurrency by the Dutch business population. (_EC-468_)\r\n\r\nThe Reichsmarks thus made available in the Netherlands were mainly used\r\nto purchase Dutch securities on the stock exchange (_EC-468_).\r\nPermission to make such purchases was extended to a large number of\r\nGerman banks by the German Ministry of Economics. The transfers were\r\nmade with “reluctance” by the Dutch, in connection with which the Reich\r\nCommissar at the Netherlands Bank observed, “it may be pointed out with\r\nsome justification that an out-payment of gulden made against a\r\nReichsmark credit, which can only result through the burdening of the\r\nNetherlands State credit, represents no genuine transfer” (_EC-468_).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the objections of the then Commissar at the Netherlands\r\nBank (_EC-468_), circular 87/40 was soon followed by No. 29/41 of 31\r\nMarch 1941, which abolished almost completely all restrictions on the\r\nfree use of the Reichsmark in Holland (_ECR-197_). Circular 29/41\r\nprovided that all foreign exchange transactions between Germany and the\r\nNetherlands were freed of control, the only important exception being\r\nthat German investments of more than 100,000 gulden in Holland required\r\npermission of the Reichskommissar in the Netherlands. The clearing\r\nagreement was abolished, and payments between Germany and the\r\nNetherlands were permitted by simple bank checks, drafts, or postal\r\nmoney orders. A simultaneous order by the Reich Commissar for the\r\nOccupied Netherlands Areas lifted all restrictions set by Netherlands\r\nforeign exchange law on such transactions (_ECR-197_).\r\n\r\nAfter this “introduction of free payments traffic” or “removal of the\r\nforeign exchange frontiers,” payments for exports from Holland were made\r\nin Germany “through the accounts of the banks, mainly through the\r\naccount of the Netherlands Bank, which takes on the exchange into gulden\r\nmeans of payment without further formalities.” (_ECR-174_)\r\n\r\nThis exchange presumably merely continued the practice introduced\r\nearlier at the “instigation” of Seyss-Inquart. At all events, the\r\nPresident of the Bank, Van Tonningen, was a Nazi agent, and his acts may\r\nbe charged to the Nazi conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe result of this radical step was this:\r\n\r\n    “Ever since the introduction of free payments traffic the status\r\n    of the Netherlands Bank is mainly influenced by the taking up of\r\n    Reichsmarks. On 31 March 1941, the day before the introduction\r\n    of free payments traffic, the Netherlands Bank had a total stock\r\n    of about 83 million RM of Reichsmark credits, on 30 April 1941\r\n    of about 213 million RM, and on 31 May 1941 of about 366 million\r\n    RM. Thus, in the two months after the removal of the foreign\r\n    exchange frontier, it has taken up about 283 million RM, the\r\n    gulden equivalent, at the rate of RM 132.7 equals florin 100, on\r\n    the basis of the transfer agreement with the Reichsbank.”\r\n    (_ECR-174_)\r\n\r\nThus the Netherlands Bank was caused to pledge its credit (in the form\r\nof Dutch currency) in exchange for a Reichsmark credit. In this manner\r\nthe Nazi conspirators were enabled to exact from the bank a loan\r\nunlimited in quantity and beyond the bank’s control, by the simple\r\nexpedient of writing out a check in Germany.\r\n\r\nE. _Argument and Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThe acts of the Nazi conspirators as revealed by the evidence constitute\r\nwar crimes within the meaning of Article 6 (B) of the charter of the\r\nInternational Military Tribunal. Two general observations should be made\r\nat the outset. In the first place, the pertinent provisions of the Hague\r\nRegulations (_3737-PS_) are controlling. The Germans entered into an\r\nArmistice Agreement with only one of the countries under discussion\r\n(France), and the Franco-German Armistice Agreement of 22 June 1940\r\ncontains nothing which purports to confer on the occupant powers broader\r\nthan those which may be exercised under the Hague Regulations. Article 3\r\nof the Armistice reserves to Germany in the occupied zone “all the\r\nrights of the occupying power.” No other provision is material here. The\r\nlanguage of Article 3 plainly does not purport to qualify in any way the\r\notherwise binding terms of the Hague Regulations. The German position\r\n(_EC-113_) that “the rights of Article 3 are more extensive than the\r\nrights of the occupation power in the Hague Regulations” and permitted\r\nGermany to base thereon “all measures which are, according to her own\r\njudgment, necessary for the continuation of the war against England,” is\r\ntherefore plainly untenable.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the collaboration of certain French, Dutch, and Belgian\r\nofficials is legally immaterial and does not serve to shield the Nazi\r\nconspirators from responsibility for the acts done in the territory\r\nunder German control. Belgium, Holland, and a large part of France were\r\nunder German occupation throughout the period in question and, after 10\r\nNovember 1942, so-called Vichy France was overrun and occupied as well.\r\nIt is accepted doctrine that governmental authority is completely,\r\nalbeit temporarily, vested in the occupant during the period of its\r\ncontrol. Whether the occupant elects to employ the existing\r\nadministrative machinery and personnel or substitute its own, is solely\r\na question of political and administrative convenience; the choice is\r\nwithout legal significance. The civil administration of an occupied\r\ncountry, it may be confidently asserted, has no independent legal status\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n(1) _The acts of the Nazi conspirators as revealed by the evidence are\r\nprohibited by the Hague Regulations._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The forcible removal of machinery, foodstuffs, and raw\r\nmaterials._ It has been shown above that the Nazis forcibly removed\r\nlarge quantities of machinery, foodstuffs, and raw materials to Germany,\r\nincluding even church bells and the strategic metals contained in the\r\ntransmission systems of the occupied countries. Articles 52 and 53 of\r\nthe Hague Regulations (the only pertinent provisions) provide no basis\r\nfor such action.\r\n\r\nArticle 52 of the Hague Regulations declares that requisitions in kind\r\nand services shall not be demanded except for “the needs of the\r\noccupation army,” a limitation deliberately substituted for the less\r\nrestrictive one of “military necessity” which had previously been\r\ncontained in the Brussels Declaration of 1874 (_Conference\r\nInternationale de la Paix, La Haye_, 1899, Part I, p. 60; Part III, pp.\r\n45, 181). It is settled that requisitions for export to the country of\r\nthe occupying power is violative of Article 52 (see Feilchenfeld, _The\r\nInternational Law of Belligerent Occupation_, Washington, 1942, pars.\r\n148-149, and cases cited).\r\n\r\nThe argument, advanced by the Germans in defense of such requisitions\r\nduring the first World War (see Garner, _International Law and World\r\nWar_, Vol. II, p. 126, n.) and frequently again during the recent\r\nconflict (_EC-344-7_; _ECH-16_), that the limitations of Article 52 may\r\nbe disregarded in case of military necessity, is not well founded.\r\nArticle 23g, which permits the destruction of private property when\r\n“imperatively demanded by the necessities of war,” is included among the\r\nprovisions relating to the rights of belligerents in the conduct of\r\nmilitary operations, and has no relation to the powers of a belligerent\r\nin an occupied area in which conflict has ceased (see Garner, _loc. cit.\r\nsupra_). The latter are governed, so far as material here, by Articles\r\n42-56.\r\n\r\nApart from Article 23g, there is no basis whatever for the German\r\nposition. The Hague Regulations are limitations on the powers which may\r\nbe exercised under the plea of military necessity (II, Oppenheim,\r\n_International Law_, 6th Edition Revised, edited by Lauterpacht, p. 185,\r\nn.1). An exception for cases of alleged military necessity, therefore,\r\ncannot be implied. The deliberate substitution of the present\r\nterminology in lieu of the vague limitations of “military necessity” as\r\ncontained in the Brussels Declaration of 1874, moreover, would seem to\r\nremove all basis for a contrary construction.\r\n\r\nArticle 53 provides no better support for the Nazis’ action. The second\r\nparagraph, relating to private property, states:\r\n\r\n    “All appliances, whether on land, on sea, or in the air, adapted\r\n    for the transmission of news, or for the transport of persons or\r\n    things, exclusive of cases governed by naval law, depots of arms\r\n    and, generally, all kinds of munitions of war, may be seized\r\n    even if they belong to private individuals, but must be restored\r\n    and compensation fixed when peace is made.”\r\n\r\nThis Article, it may be conceded, authorizes not only the sequestration\r\nbut the use of all matters within its reach. The term “munitions of\r\nwar,” however, clearly refers only to chattels (Feilchenfeld, _supra_,\r\npar. 351). It does not, therefore, include machinery affixed to the\r\nrealty. The German legal advisors uniformly so conceded during this war\r\n(_EC-560_; _EC-84_; _EC-263_; _EC-344-7_). The suggestion that Article\r\n53 is subject to an implied exception in the case of military necessity\r\n(_EC-344-7_) is, for reasons noted above, untenable. It is equally clear\r\nthat the deliberate removal of the metal content of the transmission\r\nsystems in the occupied areas is without legal basis. Article 53 in\r\nterms requires restoration when peace is made and, whatever exceptions\r\nmay be implied in case of munitions which are necessarily consumed by\r\nuse, no basis can be found for the deliberate destruction of\r\ntransmission facilities.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the class of chattels included within the\r\ndeliberately general term “munitions of war” is not free from doubt. The\r\nright of seizure is based on military necessity, namely, the danger of\r\nleaving at large things which are peculiarly adapted to warlike purposes\r\n(Spaight, _War Rights on Land_, p. 512). It should accordingly be\r\nlimited to those things which are “susceptible of direct military use”\r\n(see British Manual of Military Law, 1929, Amendment No. 12, par. 415;\r\nU. S. Army Basic Field Manual on Rules of Land Warfare, FM 27-10, 1940,\r\npar. 332). Article 53, which contains no limitation restricting seizures\r\nto the needs of the occupation army, would otherwise completely nullify\r\nthe deliberate limitations on the right of requisition imposed in\r\nArticle 52. In this view, raw materials and even semi-finished goods,\r\nsave perhaps such goods as are normally part of military equipment,\r\nwould seem outside the reach of Article 53.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The control and direction of production and distribution in the\r\nGerman interest._ The planned control and direction of the economy of\r\nthe occupied countries in the interest of the German war effort\r\nconstitute a violation of Article 52. This seems clearly true to the\r\nextent that production and sale for export to Germany were ordered by\r\nthe _Ruestungsobmann_ pursuant to Speer’s directive late in 1943. It\r\nwould seem equally true of the earlier method of control by prohibitions\r\nand restrictions. For the net effect of the priority system was to leave\r\nno alternative to producing in the German interest save to cease\r\noperations. And even this alternative was not available, since the power\r\nto appoint a commissar in case of recalcitrant plants was expressly\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\nArticle 53, which is limited to chattels and has no relation to the\r\ndemanding of personal services in any event, provides not even a remote\r\nbasis for the imposition of the controls in question.\r\n\r\nIn what has been said, it is not meant to be suggested that an occupant\r\nis without power to institute a system of rationing for articles in\r\nshort supply with the aim of securing an equitable distribution among\r\nthe population of the occupied area. Such a measure is plainly related\r\nto the promotion of economic order and there is nothing in the Hague\r\nRegulations which restricts even requisition for the needs of the local\r\npopulation. The Nazi controls, however, were exercised, not in the\r\ninterest of the local population, but to fulfill the general war\r\nrequirements of Germany, in the Reich as well as in the occupied area.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Levy of occupation charges for purposes not related to the needs\r\nof the occupation army._ Article 49 of the Hague Regulations limits the\r\nlevy of occupation charges to the “needs of the army or of the\r\nadministration of the territory in question.” The only purpose for which\r\nsuch contributions may be levied (other than for the financing of the\r\ncosts of administration, a matter not material here), is to supply the\r\nneeds of the army of occupation (_Conference Internationale de la Paix,\r\nLa Haye_, 1899, Pt. I, p. 60; Feilchenfeld, _supra_, par. 167; Spaight,\r\n_supra_, pp. 384-392). The power to levy contributions is reserved in\r\norder to permit an equitable distribution among the entire community of\r\ncosts which, if supplies were requisitioned, would fall directly and\r\nsolely on the owners of the requisitioned property (Spaight, _supra_,\r\npp. 387-389). Accordingly, the levy of contributions to finance exports\r\nor for other purposes unrelated to the needs of the army in the\r\nterritory in question would seem plainly forbidden (Feilchenfeld,\r\n_supra_, par. 167; Spaight, _supra_, pp. 384-392).\r\n\r\nMoreover, as Article 49 refers to the occupation army only, the levy of\r\ncontributions to support the troops engaged in military operations\r\nagainst an enemy located outside the boundaries of the occupied country\r\nor to finance other general war expenses would seem prohibited.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Forced loans._ Forced loans can be justified only as\r\ncontributions and are therefore subject to the same limitations\r\n(Feilchenfeld, _supra_, par. 185). The forced loans under the\r\nBelgian-German and Franco-German clearing arrangements, were executed\r\nlargely to finance exports to Germany, that is, for nonoccupation\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The exchange of reichsmarks for gulden by the Netherlands Bank._\r\nThese transactions, whether viewed as resulting in a loan or merely in\r\nan exchange, constitute a contribution of money for nonoccupation\r\npurposes. It may be assumed that they were carried out “voluntarily”\r\nwhile the Netherlands Bank was under the immediate direction of Rost Van\r\nTonningen. This circumstance is immaterial, however, since Van Tonningen\r\nwas a civil official appointed by Seyss-Inquart, and his authority, like\r\nthat of civilian officials in occupied areas generally, was derived\r\nsolely from that of the occupant.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _The taking over of gold of the National Bank of Belgium and the\r\nNetherlands Bank._ That the gold of the National Bank of Belgium was\r\nprivate property is not disputed; the Nazi conspirators proceeded on\r\nthis view in the original decision to requisition under Article 52\r\n(_EC-401, second enclosure_). Confiscation under Article 53, first\r\nparagraph, therefore, was not open to the Nazi conspirators; so far as\r\nappears they never considered such a step.\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed for purposes of argument that gold is subject to\r\nrequisition under the Hague Regulations. Requisition may be made,\r\nhowever, only for the needs of the occupation army. It cannot be\r\nresorted to to relieve the “considerable straining of the reserves” of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe gold reserve of the Netherlands Bank, it is believed, is private\r\nproperty, no less than that of the National Bank of Belgium. In this\r\nview, the taking over of the gold of the Netherlands Bank was likewise\r\nillegal. There is, of course, no basis in law for exacting a\r\ncontribution for the so-called “war against Bolshevism,” to use the\r\nNazis’ phrase. And, for the reasons indicated above, it is immaterial\r\nwhether these “contributions” were “voluntarily” made by Van Tonningen.\r\n\r\n(_g_) _The compulsory surrender of gold and foreign exchange._ The\r\nrequirement of surrender of gold and foreign exchange for ultimate\r\ndelivery to the Reichsbank amounts in substance to a requisition and\r\ncannot be supported because obviously done solely to maintain the\r\nreserves of foreign exchange for the total war effort, not for the needs\r\nof the occupation army alone.\r\n\r\n(_h_) _The acquisition of business interests._ The Nazis’ acquisition of\r\nBelgian, Dutch, and French participations was unlawful. That this is so\r\nin the case of the sales ordered by the Ministry of Economics is clear\r\n(_EC-43_). The conclusion should be the same even when sale was not\r\nexpressly ordered. These purchases were financed through the clearing\r\nsystem (which, as shown above, constituted a forced loan) and out of\r\noccupation cost funds. Since such expenditures bore no relation to the\r\nneeds of the occupation army or, indeed, served any purpose other than\r\nto enrich the Nazi conspirators and their nominees, the Nazi program for\r\nacquisition of participations was in plain violation of Article 49 of\r\nthe Hague Regulations.\r\n\r\n(2) _Such acts constitute “plunder of public or private property” within\r\nthe meaning of Article 6 (B) of the Charter of the International\r\nMilitary Tribunal._ Save as they may be authorized by International Law\r\n(and hence “consented” to by the occupied countries), the acts\r\ncomplained of are of a character condemned by the criminal code of the\r\noccupied countries and, indeed, of all civilized nations. Absent such\r\nauthority, the forcible permanent taking of money or other property\r\nwhether from Government agencies or private persons, constitutes larceny\r\nor, as known in the international law of belligerent occupation,\r\n“pillage” (Garner, _supra_, pp. 472-473). The question of which court or\r\ncourts may try and punish for the offense is one of jurisdiction only\r\n(see Garner, _supra_, pp. 475-480) and has been resolved by the\r\nAgreement and Charter of the International Military Tribunal.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n  LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO GERMANIZATION AND\r\n                               SPOLIATION\r\n\r\n    Document    │              Description               │ Vol. │  Page\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military   │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6, especially 6 (b, │      │\r\n                │  c).                                   │  I   │       5\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal,        │      │\r\n                │  Indictment Number 1, Sections III;    │      │ 15, 43,\r\n                │  VIII (E, J).                          │  I   │      51\r\n                │                                        │      │\r\n 3737-PS        │Hague Convention of 1907 respecting the │      │\r\n                │  Laws and Customs of War on Land,      │      │\r\n                │  Annex, Articles 49, 52, 53, 55.       │  VI  │598, 599\r\n                │                 —————                  │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a    │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was│      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg    │      │\r\n                │trial.

THE EINSATZSTAB ROSENBERG\r\n\r\nA. _Formation, Purpose, Powers._\r\n\r\nOn 29 January 1940 Hitler issued a decree in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “The ‘Hohe Schule’ is supposed to become the center for national\r\n    socialistic ideological and educational research. It will be\r\n    established after the conclusion of the war. I order that the\r\n    already initiated preparations be continued by Reichsleiter\r\n    Alfred Rosenberg, especially in the way of research and the\r\n    setting up of the library.\r\n\r\n    “All sections of Party and State are requested to cooperate with\r\n    him in this task.” (_136-PS_)\r\n\r\nWhat began as a project for the establishment of a research library\r\ndeveloped into a project for the seizure of cultural treasures.\r\n(_141-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 1 March 1942 Hitler issued a decree in which he asserted that Jews,\r\nFreemasons, and affiliated opponents of National Socialism are the\r\nauthors of the War against the Reich, and that a systematic spiritual\r\nbattle against them is a military necessity. The decree thereupon\r\nauthorized Rosenberg to search libraries, archives, lodges, and cultural\r\nestablishments, to seize relevant material from these establishments as\r\nwell as cultural treasures which were the property or in the possession\r\nof Jews, which were ownerless, or the origin of which could not be\r\nclearly established. The decree directed the cooperation of the\r\n_Wehrmacht_ High Command and indicated that Rosenberg’s activities in\r\nthe West were to be conducted in his capacity as Reichsleiter and in the\r\nEast in his capacity as Reichsminister. (_149-PS_)\r\n\r\nThis decree was implemented by a letter from Dr. Lammers, Reichsminister\r\nand Chief of Chancellory, directed to the “Highest Reich Authorities and\r\nthe Services directly subordinate to the Fuehrer.” The letter reiterated\r\nthe terms of the Hitler decree and requested support of the Reich\r\nauthorities in Rosenberg’s fulfillment of his task. (_154-PS_)\r\n\r\nB. _Scope of Activities._\r\n\r\nRosenberg’s activities in fulfillment of the above decrees were\r\nextended, in the West, to France (_138-PS_), Belgium (_139-PS_), the\r\nNetherlands (_140-PS_), Luxembourg (_137-PS_), and Norway and Denmark.\r\n(_159-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the East activities were carried out throughout the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories (_153-PS_), including the Baltic states and the Ukraine\r\n(_151-PS_), as well as in Hungary (_158-PS_), Greece (_171-PS_), and\r\nYugoslavia. (_071-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe function of the Rosenberg Organization included not only the seizure\r\nof books and scientific materials specified in the original Hitler Order\r\n(_171-PS_), but the seizure of private art treasures (_1015-B-PS_),\r\npublic art treasures (_055-PS_), and household furnishings. (_L-188_)\r\n\r\nC. _Cooperating Agencies._\r\n\r\nOn 5 July 1940 Keitel (Chief of the OKW) informed the Chief of the Army\r\nHigh Command (OKH) and the Chief of the Armed Forces in The Netherlands\r\nthat the Fuehrer had ordered that Rosenberg’s suggestion be followed, to\r\nthe effect that certain libraries and archives, chancelleries of high\r\nchurch authorities, and lodges be searched for documents valuable to\r\nGermany or indicating political maneuvers directed against Germany, and\r\nthat such material be seized. The letter further stated that Hitler had\r\nordered the support of the Gestapo and that the Chief of the Sipo\r\n(Security Police), SS-Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich, had been informed and\r\nwould communicate with the competent military commanders. (_137-PS_)\r\n\r\nKeitel issued a further order to the Chief of the OKH, France, on 17\r\nSeptember 1940, providing:\r\n\r\n    “The ownership status before the war in France, prior to the\r\n    declaration of war on 1 September 1939, shall be the criterion.\r\n\r\n    “Ownership transfers to the French state or similar transfers\r\n    completed after this date are irrelevant and legally invalid\r\n    (for example, Polish and Slovak libraries in Paris, possessions\r\n    of the Palais Rothschild or other ownerless Jewish possessions).\r\n    Reservations regarding search, seizure and transportation to\r\n    Germany on the basis of the above reasons will not be\r\n    recognized.\r\n\r\n    “Reichsleiter Rosenberg and/or his deputy\r\n    Reichshauptstellenleiter Ebert has received clear instructions\r\n    from the Fuehrer personally governing the right of seizure; he\r\n    is entitled to transport to Germany cultural goods which appear\r\n    valuable to him and to safeguard them there. The Fuehrer has\r\n    reserved for himself the decision as to their use.\r\n\r\n    “It is requested that the services in question be informed\r\n    correspondingly.” (_138-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe above order was extended to Belgium on 10 October 1940 (_139-PS_),\r\nand an identical order was issued by the Chief of the OKH to the Armed\r\nForces Commander in The Netherlands on 17 September 1940. (_140-PS_)\r\n\r\nHitler’s order of 1 March 1942 stated:\r\n\r\n    “Directions for carrying out this order in cooperation with the\r\n    Wehrmacht will be issued by the Chief of the Wehrmacht High\r\n    Command in agreement with Reichsleiter Rosenberg.” (_149-PS_)\r\n\r\nDr. Lammers’ order of 5 July 1942 declared that the Chief of the OKH, in\r\nagreement with Keitel, would issue regulations governing the cooperation\r\nwith the Wehrmacht and the Police Services for assistance in making\r\nseizures. (_154-PS_)\r\n\r\nAn official of the Rosenberg Ministry for the Occupied East declared the\r\nWehrmacht to be one of the primary agencies engaged in removing art\r\ntreasures from Russia. (_1107-PS_)\r\n\r\nCooperation of the SS and the SD was indicated by Rosenberg in a letter\r\nto Bormann on 23 April 1941:\r\n\r\n    “* * * It is understood that the confiscations are not executed\r\n    by the regional authorities but that this is conducted by the\r\n    Security Service as well as by the police. * * * it has been\r\n    communicated to me in writing by a Gauleiter, that the chief\r\n    office of the Reich Security (RSHA) of the SS has claimed the\r\n    following from the library of a monastery: * * *.” (_071-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe above letter also points out that there has been\r\n\r\n    “* * * close cooperation on the widest scale with the Security\r\n    Service and the military commanders. * * *\r\n\r\n    “This affair (Operations in Salonika) has already been executed\r\n    on our side with the Security Service (SD) in the most loyal\r\n    fashion.” (_071-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe National Socialist Party financed the operations of the _Einsatzstab\r\nRosenberg_. (_090-PS_; _145-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Goering, 18 June 1942, Rosenberg voiced the opinion that\r\nall art objects and other confiscated items should belong to the\r\nNational Socialist Party because the Party has been bearing the brunt of\r\nthe battle against the persons and forces from whom this property was\r\ntaken. (_1118-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _Cooperation of Hermann Goering._\r\n\r\nOn 5 November 1940, Goering issued an order specifying the distribution\r\nto be made of art objects brought to the Louvre. The order lists as\r\nsecond in priority of disposition, “Those art objects which serve to the\r\ncompletion of the Reichsmarshal’s collection” and states that the\r\nobjects will “be packed and shipped to Germany with the assistance of\r\nthe Luftwaffe.” (_141-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 1 May 1941 Goering issued an order to all Party, State, and Wehrmacht\r\nServices requesting them:\r\n\r\n    “* * * to give all possible support and assistance to the Chief\r\n    of Staff of Reichsleiter Rosenberg’s Staff,\r\n    Reichshauptstellenleiter Party Comrade Utikal, and his deputy\r\n    DRK-Feldfuehrer Party Comrade von Behr, in the discharge of\r\n    their duties. The above-mentioned persons are requested to\r\n    report to me on their work, particularly on any difficulties\r\n    that might arise.” (_1117-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 30 May 1942, Goering claimed credit for the success of the\r\n_Einsatzstab_:\r\n\r\n    “* * * On the other hand I also support personally the work of\r\n    your _Einsatzstab_ wherever I can do so, and a great part of the\r\n    seized cultural goods can be accounted for because I was able to\r\n    assist the _Einsatzstab_ by my organizations.” (_1015-I-PS_)\r\n\r\nE. _Method of Operation._\r\n\r\nThe staff of the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_ seized not only “abandoned” art\r\ntreasures but also treasures which had been hidden, or were left in the\r\ncustody of depots or warehouses, including art treasures that were\r\nalready packed for shipment to America. (_1015-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nRobert Scholz, Chief of the Special Staff for Pictorial Art, described\r\nthe thoroughness with which the _Einsatzstab_ conducted investigations\r\nand seizures:\r\n\r\n    “* * * These seizures were carried out on the basis of\r\n    preliminary exhaustive investigations into the address lists of\r\n    the French Police authorities, on the basis of Jewish handbooks,\r\n    warehouse inventories and order books of French shipping firms\r\n    as well as on the basis of French art and collection catalogs.\r\n\r\n    “* * * The seizure of ownerless Jewish works of art has\r\n    gradually extended over the whole French territory.”\r\n    (_1015-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn the East, members of Rosenberg’s staff operated directly behind the\r\nfront in close cooperation with the infantry. (_035-PS_)\r\n\r\nVon Behr, in a progress report dated 8 August 1944, described the method\r\nof seizing household furnishings:\r\n\r\n    “The confiscation of Jewish homes was effected in most cases in\r\n    such a way that the so-called confiscation officials went from\r\n    house to house when no records were available of the addresses\r\n    of Jews who had departed or fled, as was the case for example,\r\n    in Paris * * * They drew up inventories of these homes and\r\n    subsequently sealed them . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n    “The goods are dispatched first, to large collecting camps from\r\n    where they are turned over, sorted out and loaded for Germany.\r\n\r\n    “* * * work shops were established for cabinet-makers,\r\n    watchmakers, shoemakers, electricians, radio experts, furriers,\r\n    etc. All incoming goods were diligently sorted out and those not\r\n    ready for use were repaired. Moreover special boxes were\r\n    dispatched for the use of special trades * * *\r\n\r\n    “For the sorting out of the confiscated furniture and goods on\r\n    the invisible assembly line and for the packing and loading,\r\n    exclusive use was made of interned Jews. Because of its\r\n    experience as to confiscation, as to working systems within the\r\n    camps, and as to transportation, the Office West was able to\r\n    reorganize their entire working system and thus to succeed in\r\n    providing for the use in Germany of even things which appeared\r\n    to be valueless such as scrap paper, rags, salvage, etc. * * *”\r\n    (_L-188_).\r\n\r\nF. _Nature, Extent, and Value of Property Seized._\r\n\r\n(1) _Books, manuscripts, documents, and incunabula._ A report on the\r\nlibrary of the “_Hohe Schule_,” prepared by Dr. Wunder, lists the most\r\nsignificant book collections belonging to the library and confiscated by\r\nthe _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_ in accordance with the orders of the\r\nFuehrer, as follows (_171-PS_):\r\n\r\n                                                             (approx.)\r\n Alliance Israelite Universelle                             40,000  Vols.\r\n Ecole Rabbinique                                           10,000  Vols.\r\n Federation de Societé des Juifs de France                   4,000  Vols.\r\n Lipschuetz Bookstore, Paris                                20,000  Vols.\r\n Rothschild Family, Paris                                   28,000  Vols.\r\n Rosenthaliana, Amsterdam                                   20,000  Vols.\r\n Sefardischen Jewish Community, Amsterdam                   25,000  Vols.\r\n Occupied Eastern Territories                              280,000  Vols.\r\n Jewish Community, Greece                                   10,000  Vols.\r\n “Special Action”, Rhineland                                 5,000  Vols.\r\n Other sources                                             100,000  Vols.\r\n                                                               ———\r\n                                                           552,000\r\n\r\nAn undated report on the activities of the _Einsatzstab_ Working Group,\r\nNetherlands, lists Masonic Lodges and other organizations whose\r\nlibraries and archives have been seized.

(_707-PS_)\r\n\r\nReporting on the withdrawal from the Ukraine, Staff Director Utikal\r\naccounted for the removal of the following materials:\r\n\r\n     From the Museum of Art at Charcow:\r\n       Ukrainian paintings                                        96\r\n       Western European paintings                                185\r\n       Wood carvings and etchings                                 12\r\n       Carpets and tapestries                                     25\r\n\r\n     From the Ukrainian museum in Kiev:\r\n       Textiles of all sorts.\r\n       Collection of valuable embroidery patterns.\r\n       Collection of brocades.\r\n       Numerous items of wood, etc.                       (_035-PS_)\r\n\r\nIn addition Utikal reported shipment of a total of 131 cases containing:\r\n10,186 books, the catalog of the “East” library, art folios, samples of\r\nmagazines, Bolshevist pictures, and Bolshevist films. Utikal also\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    “Moreover an essential part of the prehistoric museum was\r\n    transported away.” (_035-PS_)\r\n\r\nAnother report on the shipment of works of art from the Ukraine, 12\r\nSeptember 1944, indicated the value of the contents of 85 chests of art\r\nobjects:\r\n\r\n    “There are a great many of the oldest ikons, works of famous\r\n    masters of the German, Dutch and Italian schools of the 16th,\r\n    17th and 18th centuries, as well as works of the best Russian\r\n    artists of the 18th and 19th centuries. On the whole, the\r\n    contents include the most valuable works of the known Ukrainian\r\n    art possession, which in themselves represent a value of many\r\n    millions after a cursory appraisal.” (_055-PS_)\r\n\r\nAttached to the above report is a detailed inventory listing hundreds of\r\nindividual objects.\r\n\r\nAdditional evidence as to the extent of material seized in Kiev is found\r\nin a secret note, 17 June 1944, dealing with measures taken prior to the\r\nRussian Occupation. The note reported the taking of materials from\r\nmuseums, archives, institutions, etc., during the autumn of 1943 on the\r\norder of the _Einsatzstab_ and of the Reichs-commissar. During October\r\nthere were sent to the Reich 40 railway trucks, carrying mostly goods\r\nbelonging to the Central Research Institute of the Ukraine. The report\r\nconcluded with the statement that when the Soviets entered the town\r\nnothing of value was left. (_1109-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 28 September 1941, the General Commissar for White Ruthenia reported\r\nthe seizure of art treasures in the area of Minsk, destined for\r\nKonigsberg and Linz. The value of these confiscations was stated to\r\namount to millions of marks.

(_1015-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nAs early as 28 January 1941, Rosenberg stated, with reference to\r\nproperties seized in France alone:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the value involved will come close to a billion\r\n    Reichsmarks.” (_090-PS_)\r\n\r\nScholz, in his report on activities from March 1941 to July 1944,\r\nexpressed the value of the seizures as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The extraordinary artistic and material value of the seized art\r\n    works cannot be expressed in figures. The paintings, period\r\n    furniture of the 17th and 18th Centuries, the Gobelins, the\r\n    antiques and renaissance jewelry of the Rothschild’s are objects\r\n    of such a unique character that their evaluation is impossible,\r\n    since no comparable values have so far appeared on the art\r\n    market.\r\n\r\n    “A short report, moreover, can only hint at the artistic worth\r\n    of the collections. Among the seized paintings, pastels and\r\n    drawings there are several hundred works of the first quality,\r\n    masterpieces of European art, which could take first place in\r\n    any museum. Included therein are absolutely authenticated signed\r\n    works of Rembrandt Van Rijn, Rubens, Frans Hals, Vermeer van\r\n    Delft, Valasquez, Murillo, Goya, Sebastiano del Piombo, Palma\r\n    Vecchio, etc.\r\n\r\n    “Of first importance among the seized paintings are the works of\r\n    the famous French painters of the 18th Century, with\r\n    masterpieces of Boucher, Watteau, Rigaud, Largielliere, Rattler,\r\n    Fragonard, Pater, Danloux and de Troy.\r\n\r\n    “This collection can compare with those of the best European\r\n    museums. It includes many works of the foremost French masters,\r\n    who up to now have been only inadequately represented in the\r\n    best German museums. Very important also is the representation\r\n    of masterpieces of the Dutch Painters of the 17th and 18th\r\n    Centuries. First of all should be mentioned the works of Van\r\n    Dyck, Saloman and Jacob Ruisdal, Wouvermann, Terborch, Jan\r\n    Weenix, Gabriel Metsu, Adrian van Ostade, David Teniers, Pieter\r\n    de Hooch, Willem van der Velde, etc.\r\n\r\n    “Of foremost importance also are the represented works of\r\n    English painting of the 18th and early 19th centuries, with\r\n    masterpieces of Reynolds, Romney, and Gainsborough. Cranach and\r\n    Amberger, among the German masters, should be mentioned.\r\n\r\n    “The collection of French furniture of the 17th and 18th\r\n    centuries is perhaps even more highly to be evaluated. This\r\n    contains hundreds of the best preserved and, for the most part,\r\n    signed works of the best known cabinet-makers from the period\r\n    between Louis XIV to Louis XVI. Since German cabinetmakers\r\n    played an important part in this golden age of French cabinetry,\r\n    now recognized for the first time in the field of art, this\r\n    collection is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\n    “The collection of Gobelins and Persian tapestries contains\r\n    numerous world-famous objects. The collection of handicraft\r\n    works and the Rothschild collection of renaissance jewelry is\r\n    valuable beyond comparison.” (_1015-B-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe report refers to 25 portfolios of pictures of the most valuable\r\nworks of the art collections seized in the West, which portfolios were\r\npresented to the Fuehrer. Ten additional portfolios are stated to be\r\nattached to the report and additional portfolios are said to be in\r\npreparation. Thirty-nine leatherbound volumes prepared by the\r\n_Einsatzstab_ contain photographs of paintings, textiles, furniture,\r\ncandelabra, and numerous other objects of art and illustrate the\r\nmagnitude and value of the collection made by _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_.\r\n\r\n                      2. THE GENERAL-GOUVERNEMENT\r\n\r\nA. _Confiscatory Laws and Decrees_\r\n\r\nIn October 1939 Goering issued a verbal order to Dr. Muehlmann asking\r\nhim to undertake the immediate securing of all Polish art treasures.\r\n(_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nOn 15 November 1939, Hans Frank, Governor-General for the Occupied\r\nPolish Territories, issued a decree providing in part:\r\n\r\n    “Article 1. 1.

The\r\ndecree, 1 December 1939, was circulated on 16 December 1939, the same\r\ndate as the promulgation of the decree of Dr. Muehlmann, above referred\r\nto (_1773-PS_).

They are to be regarded as made for the benefit of\r\n    the German Reich and are at the disposal of the Reich\r\n    Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germanism.” (_R-143_)\r\n\r\nThe methodical nature of the Art Seizure Program, and the existence of a\r\ngeneral policy of confiscation of art treasures, is indicated in section\r\nV of Himmler’s decree:\r\n\r\n    “In due course the usual questionnaires for cataloguing\r\n    confiscated articles are to be sent to the Chief Custodian\r\n    East.” (_R-143_)\r\n\r\nThe intention to enrich Germany by the seizures rather than merely to\r\nprotect the seized objects is indicated in a report by Dr. Hans Posse,\r\nDirector of the Dresden State Picture Gallery:\r\n\r\n    “I was able to gain some knowledge on the public and private\r\n    collections as well as clerical property in Cracow and Warsaw.\r\n    It is true that we cannot hope too much to enrich ourselves from\r\n    the acquisition of great Art works, of paintings and sculptures,\r\n    with the exception of the Veit-Stoss Altar and the plates of\r\n    Hans Von Kulmbach in the Church of Maria in Cracow . . . . . .\r\n    and several other works from the National Museum in Warsaw. * *\r\n    *” (_1600-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe avowed purpose of the art treasure seizures was the promulgation of\r\nGerman Culture throughout the Occupied East:\r\n\r\n    “* * * the result is put down in the catalogue together with\r\n    reproductions, and this is a definite proof of the penetration\r\n    of the East by the German Cultural urge.” (_1233-PS_)\r\n\r\nC. _Nature, Extent, and Value of Property Seized._\r\n\r\nVirtually the entire art possession of Poland, private as well as\r\npublic, was seized by the General Gouvernement (_1233-PS_). In a\r\ncatalogue of the more important works of art seized by the General\r\nGouvernement, paragraph 1 of the Foreword contains the following\r\nadmission:\r\n\r\n    “On the basis of the decree of the General Governor for the\r\n    Occupied Polish Territories of December 16, 1939, the Special\r\n    Delegate for the Safeguarding of Treasures of Art and Culture\r\n    was able in the course of six months to secure almost the entire\r\n    art treasure of the country, with one single exception: the\r\n    Flemish Gobelin series from the castle in Cracow. According to\r\n    the latest information, these are kept in France, so that it\r\n    will be possible to secure them eventually.” (_1233-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe nature and extent of materials seized by the General Gouvernement is\r\nindicated in Document _1709-PS_. The document inventories the objects\r\nseized, and divides them into two classifications: those of primary\r\nimportance (“Reich-important”), and those of secondary importance.\r\nArticles of primary importance, totaling 521 separate objects, are also\r\nset forth in a descriptive catalogue. (_1233-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe articles catalogued include paintings by German, Italian, Dutch,\r\nFrench, and Spanish masters, rare illustrated books, Indian and Persian\r\nminiatures, woodcuts, the famous Veit-Stoss hand-carved altar,\r\nhandicraft articles of gold and silver, antique furniture, articles of\r\ncrystal, glass and porcelain, tapestries, antique weapons, rare coins,\r\nand medals. The objects were seized from both public and private\r\nsources, including the National Museum in Cracow and the National Museum\r\nin Warsaw, the cathedrals of Warsaw and Lublin, a number of churches and\r\nmonasteries, the Chateau of the Kings in Warsaw, university and other\r\nlibraries, and a large number of private collections of the Polish\r\nnobility. (_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nItems placed in the second category are of the same nature as those\r\nplaced in category I. Approximately 500 separate items are catalogued,\r\nmany of the items including a large number of separate objects treated\r\nunder a single catalogue heading. (_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe value of the objects seized from 22 collections is stated to be\r\n9,437,000 Zloty. The materials referred to are only a portion of those\r\nselected as being of secondary importance. No valuation is given as to\r\nthe balance of the items of secondary importance or as to the 521\r\nobjects selected as being of primary importance. (_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nD. _Evidence That Seizures Were Not Merely for Protective Purposes._\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Posse’s report (_1600-PS_), a number of items are referred to\r\nwhich may be found in the catalogue of art objects “made secure”\r\n(_1233-PS_):\r\n\r\n    “I was able to gain some knowledge on the public and private\r\n    collections as well as clerical property in Cracow and Warsaw.\r\n    It is true that we cannot hope too much to enrich ourselves from\r\n    the acquisition of great Art works, of paintings and sculptures,\r\n    with the exception of the Veit-Stoss altar and the plates of\r\n    Hans von Kulmbach in the Church of Maria in Cracow, the Raphael,\r\n    Leonardo and Rembrandt from the collection Czartoryski, and\r\n    several other works from the National Museum in Warsaw, * * *\r\n    works of a rather high value of whose existence we in Germany\r\n    had already known. Richer and more extensive is the Polish stock\r\n    of ‘objects d’art’, such as handicraft in gold and silver, of\r\n    German origin to a large part, particularly from the Church of\r\n    Maria and the Cathedral of Wawel, tapestries, arms, porcelains,\r\n    furniture, bronzes, coins, valuable parchment scrips, books,\r\n    etc. * * *”\r\n\r\n    *            *            *            *            *            *\r\n\r\n    “As I said before, I shall not be able to make proposals\r\n    regarding the distribution as long as an inventory of the entire\r\n    material does not exist. However, I should like to reserve for\r\n    the museum at Linz the three most important paintings of the\r\n    Czartoryski collection, namely the Raphael, Leonardo and\r\n    Rembrandt which are at present in the Kaiser-Frederick Museum in\r\n    Berlin. We in Dresden are particularly interested in the\r\n    interior decorations of the castle of the Kings in Warsaw since\r\n    Saxonian architects and artists have created them; therefore,\r\n    the suggestion is made that the salvaged parts of it\r\n    (panellings, doors, inlaid floors, sculptures, mirrors,\r\n    glass-chandeliers, porcelains, etc.) be used for the interior\r\n    decoration of the Pavillion of the ‘Zivinges’ in Dresden.”\r\n    (_1600-PS_)\r\n\r\nThe following items listed in the above report are also listed in the\r\ncatalogue:\r\n\r\n _Item_                                                    _Catalog No._\r\n Veit-Stoss Altar                                                    241\r\n Hans Vol Kulmbach Works                                              22\r\n Raphael                                                             141\r\n Leonardo                                                            134\r\n Rembrandt                                                            81\r\n Church of Maria Handicraft                            262-265, 279, 280\r\n From Jagellonic Library                    166, 167, 186, 199-203, 206,\r\n                                                       209, 212, 215-224\r\n                                             (_See 1233-PS_; _1600-PS_.)\r\n\r\nAppendix 8 of Document _1709-PS_ lists a large number of objects which\r\nwere turned over to Architect Koettgen. The items listed include, in\r\naddition to paintings, tapestries, etc., plates, dishes, cups and\r\nsaucers, vases, cream pitchers, glasses, a bread basket, a service tray,\r\nand other items of table service. These objects were turned over to the\r\narchitect for the purpose of furnishing the Castle at Cracow and Schloss\r\nKressendorf for the Governor. (_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nA number of objects were transported out of Poland and placed in Berlin\r\nin the Depot of the Special Deputy or in the safe of the Deutsche Bank\r\n(_1709-PS_). Items at this location are also listed in the catalog\r\n(_1233-PS_) as numbers 4, 17, 27, 35, 42, 45, 47, 51, 138, 141, 145, and\r\n148.\r\n\r\nThirty-one sketches by Durer were taken from the collection Lubomierski\r\nin Lemberg:\r\n\r\n    “The Special Deputy has personally handed over these sketches in\r\n    July 1941 to the Reichsmarshal who took them to the Fuehrer at\r\n    headquarters where they remain at the present time. On express\r\n    direction of the Fuehrer they will stay in his possession for\r\n    the time being.” (_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nAll art objects seized were screened for those which were important from\r\nthe German point of view:\r\n\r\n    “The Reich-important pieces were collected in a catalogue of the\r\n    so called ‘First Choice’. One copy of this catalogue has been\r\n    submitted to the Fuehrer who reserved to himself the first\r\n    decision as to location and use of the art objects of the ‘First\r\n    Choice’”. (_1709-PS_)\r\n\r\nDr. Muehlmann, the “Special Deputy for the Safeguarding of Art\r\nTreasures” in the General Government, has confirmed that it was the\r\npolicy and purpose of the art seizure program to confiscate the art\r\ntreasures and to retain them for the benefit of Germany:\r\n\r\n“I confirm, that it was the official policy of the Governor General,\r\nHans Frank, to take into custody all important art treasures, which\r\nbelonged to Polish public institutions, private collections and the\r\nChurch. I confirm, that the art treasures, mentioned, were actually\r\nconfiscated, and it is clear to me, that they would not have remained in\r\nPoland in case of a German victory, but that they would have been used\r\nto complement German artistic property.” (_3042-PS_)\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n LEGAL REFERENCES AND LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE PLUNDER OF ART\r\n                               TREASURES\r\n\r\n    Document    │                Description                │ Vol. │ Page\r\n                │                                           │      │\r\n                │Charter of the International Military      │      │\r\n                │  Tribunal, Article 6 (b).                 │  I   │     5\r\n                │                                           │      │\r\n                │International Military Tribunal, Indictment│      │\r\n                │  Number 1, Sections III; VIII (E).        │  I   │15, 43\r\n                │                                           │      │\r\n 3737-PS        │Hague Convention of 1907 respecting the    │      │\r\n                │  Laws and Customs of War on Land, Annex,  │      │  597,\r\n                │  Articles 46, 47, 56.                     │  VI  │   599\r\n                │                   —————                   │      │\r\n                │Note: A single asterisk (*) before a       │      │\r\n                │document indicates that the document was   │      │\r\n                │received in evidence at the Nurnberg trial.│      │\r\n                │A double asterisk (**) before a document   │      │\r\n                │number indicates that the document was     │      │\r\n                │referred to during the trial but was not   │      │\r\n                │formally received in evidence, for the     │      │\r\n                │reason given in parentheses following the  │      │\r\n                │description of the document.

American spelling occurs throughout the document. There are\r\ndifferences in spellings of cities depending on whether the source is\r\nthe prosecutor or part of a quoted statement. Multiple occurrences of\r\nthe following spellings which differ and are found throughout this\r\nvolume are as follows:\r\n\r\n                           Luxemburg Luxembourg\r\n                            Esthonia Estonia\r\n                                Kiew Kiev\r\n                            Roumania Rumania\r\n                     Czecho-Slovakia Checkoslovakia\r\n\r\nAlthough some sentences may appear to have incorrect spellings or verb\r\ntenses, the original text has been maintained as presented read into the\r\nrecord and reflects the actual translations of the various national\r\ndocuments presented as material for the trial(s). This volume had no\r\nGerman, Polish, Czech, Russian or other eastern European diacritics,\r\nonly French diacritics. As a result, Goering and Fuehrer are spelled\r\nwithout umlauts throughout.\r\n\r\nA correction of fact has been made on page 778 regarding “. . . the\r\nItalian invasion of Greece on 28 November 1940. . . .” It should be “28\r\nOctober 1940”. In this ebook, “November” is marked with overstrike and\r\n“[October]” has been added.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to produce this ebook in a format as close as\r\npossible to the original document's presentation and layout. As a\r\nresult, the reader will find that the quoted texts in the first six\r\nchapters have indented paragraphs and the remaining chapters have\r\nquotations which are not indented, just as in the original document.\r\n\r\n[The end of _Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression (Vol. I)_, by Anonymous.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression (Vol. I), by Various",
