It\r\nmeans also the person or persons who rule or control any\r\nestablishment or institution. Wherever any number of people live\r\ntogether in one house, or one town, or city, or country, there\r\nmust be government of some kind.\r\n\r\nIn the family the parents are the government. They guide and\r\nmanage the affairs of the house. They give orders to their\r\nchildren as to what they must do and what they must not do, and\r\nthey see that their orders are obeyed. This is government, and it\r\nis for the benefit of the family. If the children were to do as\r\nthey please, there would be no peace or happiness in the home.\r\n\r\nAnd in their games and amusements out of doors children find that\r\nthey must not do as they please. Every game has certain rules or\r\nlaws which those who take part in it are required to obey. In the\r\ngame of baseball, for example, the players are not allowed to act\r\nas they like. There are rules of the play, and there is an umpire\r\nto see that the rules are observed.\r\n\r\nIn the school, too, and in all business establishments there must\r\nbe government. The teachers direct the work in their classes,\r\ngiving orders to the pupils as to what lessons they must study and\r\nhow they must study them. In the store and factory there is a\r\nmanager or master who directs the business. If there were no\r\nmanagers or masters there would be nothing but disorder and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nWe can see therefore how necessary government is, and we can\r\nunderstand why it is that there must be government in the country\r\nor state in which we live. There must be laws to direct men how\r\nthey must behave towards one another and to punish those who do\r\nwrong. And there must be people to make the laws and people to see\r\nthat they are carried out.\r\n\r\nThis is CIVIL GOVERNMENT. The word CIVIL means pertaining to the\r\nstate, or to the relations between citizens and the state, and the\r\nword STATE means the whole community or body of people living\r\nunder one government.\r\n\r\nThere are different kinds of government in different countries. In\r\nsome countries the government is monarchical--that is, under one\r\nperson, a king or emperor--and in some countries it is republican.\r\n\r\nA republican government, or a republic, is a government in which\r\nthe chief power is exercised not by one person but by all the\r\npeople. The government of the United States is a republican\r\ngovernment. The government of Virginia is a republican government.\r\nThe head of the state under a republican form of government is\r\nelected by the people.\r\n\r\nThe government in a republic is usually divided into three parts\r\nor DEPARTMENTS. One department makes the laws. This is called the\r\nLEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT or the legislature. It is formed of a\r\ncertain number of persons who are elected at certain times, by the\r\npeople, and who meet to make laws that are necessary for the good\r\nof the state or country.\r\n\r\nThe second department of government is called the EXECUTIVE\r\nDEPARTMENT, and is also formed of persons who are elected by the\r\npeople, and their business is to execute or carry out the laws.\r\nTheir duty is to see that every one who violates any law of the\r\ncountry or state is brought to punishment, and that the laws made\r\nfor promoting the well-being and happiness of the people are\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThe third department of the government is the JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT\r\nor the judiciary. Its members are, in Virginia, chosen by the\r\nlegislature. Their duty is to administer the laws, that is to\r\ninquire into every case in which a person is accused of breaking\r\nthe laws, and if a person is found to be guilty, to sentence him\r\nto the punishment which the law prescribes for the crime or\r\noffence he has committed.\r\n\r\nIn this book full particulars and explanations are given as to the\r\nformation of those three departments of government, the many\r\nduties assigned to each, and how those duties are performed.\r\n\r\nIn republics government is usually carried on according to the\r\nwishes of the majority of the people. This is what is called\r\nMAJORITY RULE. At elections to form the legislative or executive\r\ndepartment, different persons or candidates are proposed for each\r\noffice, and the candidate who gets a majority of the votes is\r\nelected. A candidate is a person who is proposed for election to\r\nsome office.\r\n\r\nCandidates for public offices are proposed or nominated at what\r\nare called CONVENTIONS. A convention is a meeting of electors, or\r\nvoters, held for the purpose of agreeing upon or choosing persons\r\nto be candidates for office. Conventions are called together and\r\nconducted by organizations known as PARTIES or POLITICAL PARTIES.\r\nThere are usually at least two political parties in every country\r\nin which there is constitutional government. Each of the parties\r\nnominates candidates at every election, and tries in every\r\nlegitimate way to persuade the people to vote for its candidates.\r\n\r\nThe party whose candidates are elected is called THE PARTY IN\r\nPOWER. This is what is known as PARTY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nIt is good for the state that there should be political parties.\r\nEach party closely watches the conduct of the other, and if the\r\nparty in power make bad laws or execute the laws unfairly or\r\nunjustly, the party out of power appeals to the people by public\r\nspeeches and by writing in newspapers, and does what it can to get\r\nthe voters to vote against the party in power at the next election\r\nand turn it out of office.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen may join either of the parties he pleases, and so\r\nexercise his influence through conventions and elections to secure\r\ngood government. And it is the duty of every citizen to do this,\r\nfor good government--honest law-makers and honest administrators\r\nof the laws--is one of the greatest blessings a state can have. It\r\nis also the duty of young people to learn about the government and\r\npolitics of their state, so that when they come of age they may be\r\nable to perform their part as citizens intelligently and well.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Define GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n2. Give some illustrations of the necessity of government.\r\n\r\n3. What is the necessity for laws in a country?\r\n\r\n4. Define CIVIL.\r\n\r\n5. What is a republic?\r\n\r\n6. What does the government in a republic consist of?\r\n\r\n7. What is the duty of the legislative department?\r\n\r\n8. What is the duty of the executive department?\r\n\r\n9. What is the duty of the judicial department?\r\n\r\n10. What do you understand by majority rule?\r\n\r\n11. What is a convention?\r\n\r\n12. What is a party government?\r\n\r\n13. Why is it good for the state that there should be political\r\nparties?\r\n\r\n14. Why is it the duty of every citizen to become a member of one\r\nof the political parties?\r\n\r\n15. Why is it good for young people to learn about government and\r\npolitics?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA CIVIL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\n\r\n1. All power is vested in and hence derived from the people;\r\nmagistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times\r\namenable to them.\r\n\r\n2. Government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common\r\nbenefit, protection, and security of the people.\r\n\r\n3. No free government, or the blessing of liberty, can be\r\npreserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice,\r\nmoderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent\r\nrecurrence to fundamental principles.\r\n\r\n--Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nThe BILL OF RIGHTS is the title of the first article, or chapter,\r\nof the Constitution of Virginia. It is so called because it is a\r\ndeclaration or statement of the RIGHTS of the people in regard to\r\ngovernment. In English history the name BILL OF RIGHTS is given to\r\na declaration of rights adopted by the two houses of Parliament in\r\nEngland in 1688, and soon afterwards passed into law.\r\n\r\nVESTED IN means entrusted to or put in possession of. To vest is\r\nto invest or clothe with power or authority.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATES are public officers whose duty it is to administer the\r\nlaws. The President is the chief magistrate of the nation. It is\r\nhis duty to see that the laws of the United States are executed Or\r\ncarried out. The governor is the chief magistrate of the State;\r\nthe mayor is the chief magistrate of the city. Judges are\r\nmagistrates who preside in the courts and administer the law as\r\napplying to the cases brought before them.\r\n\r\nTrustees are persons who hold or have charge of the property of\r\nothers in trust, and as guardians, for those to whom it belongs.\r\nMagistrates hold their offices as trustees for the people, and\r\nthey are amenable, that is, answerable, to the people. If they do\r\nnot perform the duties of their offices honestly, the people can\r\ncall them to account and punish them.\r\n\r\nA FREE GOVERNMENT is a government instituted, that is,\r\nestablished, by the consent of the people. The government of the\r\nUnited States is a free government, because it has been\r\nestablished by the people, and the people can change it when they\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n\"Government ought to be established for the COMMON BENEFIT.\" This\r\nmeans that government ought to be for the benefit of all the\r\npeople, poor as well as rich, and under a free government all the\r\npeople have equal protection from the law.\r\n\r\nFUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES are principles or truths according to\r\nwhich, or upon which, systems, or laws, or institutions, are\r\nFOUNDED. The fundamental principles of free government are that\r\nall men are born equal, and that all men have equal rights to life\r\nand liberty.\r\n\r\nRECURRENCE means A GOING BACK TO. We must frequently recur, or go\r\nback to, fundamental principles in order to preserve free\r\ngovernment. We must also firmly adhere to, or practice justice,\r\nmoderation, temperance, and virtue.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE is the doing of what is right. MODERATION means the\r\navoiding of severity or harshness in our conduct towards others.\r\nTEMPERANCE is the moderate or reasonable use or enjoyment of the\r\npleasures of life. FRUGALITY is the practice of thrift and economy\r\nas opposed to extravagance. VIRTUE is the practice of the moral\r\ngood taught by religion.\r\n\r\nThe constitution guarantees to the people the right to make and to\r\nchange their own laws; the right of speedy trial by jury;\r\nprotection in the enjoyment of their inherent rights; freedom of\r\nelections; freedom of speech; freedom of the press; religious\r\nfreedom; equal civil and political rights and public privileges.\r\n\r\nIt prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines, the infliction of\r\ncruel and unusual punishments, and the taking of private property\r\nfor public uses except by law and with just compensation.\r\n\r\nA CONSTITUTION is a system or plan of government, or a written or\r\nprinted statement of the principles and rules according to which a\r\ngovernment is to be conducted. The constitution tells how the\r\ngovernment is to be formed, what it has power to do, and what it\r\nmust not do. The Constitution of Virginia GUARANTEES, that is,\r\nsecures or makes sure to the people, the right to make or change\r\nthe laws. A government under a constitution is called a\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL government.\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY JURY is trial by a judge and certain citizens who are\r\ncalled the jury. The duty of the judge is to see that the trial is\r\nconducted according to law, and to pass sentence on the accused\r\nperson if found guilty. The duty of the jury is to decide, after\r\nhearing the evidence, whether the accused person is guilty or not.\r\nThis declaration of the jury is called a VERDICT, a word which\r\nmeans a TRUE SAYING.\r\n\r\nINHERENT means inseparable from, or not to be taken away. INHERENT\r\nRIGHTS are rights that cannot justly be taken away from the\r\npeople. The right to life and liberty is an inherent right of man\r\nwhich cannot be taken away by any constitution or government.\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF ELECTIONS means freedom to hold elections to choose the\r\nofficers of government, and freedom for every citizen to vote for\r\nthe candidate of his choice. FREEDOM OF SPEECH and FREEDOM OF THE\r\nPRESS mean liberty for all to speak or publish what they desire to\r\nsay on any subject, being liable to punishment by law if they\r\nspeak or publish anything injurious to the reputation of others.\r\nRELIGIOUS FREEDOM means liberty to belong to any religion, or to\r\nworship God in any way that one thinks proper.\r\n\r\nCIVIL RIGHTS are the rights a man is entitled to as a member of\r\nthe community, such as the right to trial by jury, the right of\r\nfreedom of speech.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL RIGHTS are the rights that belong to men as citizens,\r\nSuch, as the right to vote, the right to be candidates for public\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC PRIVILEGES are benefits or advantages possessed by some and\r\nnot by others, such as charters to corporations or licenses to\r\ncarry on certain kinds of business. For example, a license to sell\r\nliquors is a public privilege. It is not for the public good that\r\nit should be given to everybody, but the Constitution guarantees\r\nthat under necessary restrictions as to the number of such\r\nlicenses granted, all citizens shall have equal rights to such\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE PROPERTY is property that belongs to private individuals.\r\nIt may be taken for public use when necessary. If a government\r\nbuilding has to be erected or a railroad made, the land required\r\nfor the purpose may be taken from the owner, but a just price must\r\nbe paid for it.\r\n\r\nWho May Vote and Hold Office. Every male citizen of the United\r\nStates, who is 21 years old, who has been a resident of the State\r\ntwo years, of the county, city, or town one year, and of the\r\nprecinct in which he offers to vote thirty days next preceding any\r\nelection, has been registered and has paid his state poll taxes,\r\nshall be entitled to vote; except idiots and lunatics, persons\r\nconvicted after the adoption of the constitution of bribery in any\r\nelection, embezzlement of public funds, treason, felony, or petit\r\nlarceny, obtaining money or other property under false pretences,\r\nor who have been in any way concerned in a duel.\r\n\r\nAll persons entitled to vote shall be eligible to any office\r\nwithin the gift of the people, except as restricted by the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nExcepting the requirements of residence in the voting precinct,\r\npayment of poll tax and registration, the qualifications of jurors\r\nare practically the same as those of voters.\r\n\r\nA CITIZEN is a native of the United States or a foreigner who has\r\nbeen made a citizen. To be made a citizen, a person must, at least\r\ntwo years before admission, make a declaration before a judge that\r\nit is his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and\r\nto renounce allegiance to all foreign powers or princes. Having so\r\ndeclared his intention, and after residing five years in the\r\nUnited States, he must declare on oath before a judge that he\r\nrenounces allegiance to all foreign powers, and that he will\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States. He then receives a\r\npaper or document certifying that he is a citizen. The paper is\r\ncalled a NATURALIZATION paper, and the person who receives it is\r\nsaid to be NATURALIZED, because it entitles him to all the rights\r\nand privileges of a NATIVE or NATURAL-BORN citizen of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nCONVICTED means tried in a public court for a crime and found\r\nguilty. BRIBERY in elections is buying or selling votes, or giving\r\nmoney or payment in any form to a voter for voting for any\r\ncandidate. EMBEZZLEMENT is the crime a person commits who takes\r\nfor his own use the money or property of others that has been\r\nentrusted to his care. TREASON is to make war against or try to\r\noverthrow or destroy the government of one's own country. FELONY\r\nis a crime that may be punished by death or imprisonment in state\r\nprison. PETIT LARCENY is the stealing of goods of small value.\r\n\r\nEvery voter is required to be registered. This is a most important\r\nproceeding, as it insures the purity of the ballot and the\r\nintelligent exercise of the right of franchise. Elections. Shall\r\nbe by ballot; for State, county, corporation and district\r\nofficers, shall be held the Tuesday after the first Monday in\r\nNovember; except for mayors and councils of cities and towns,\r\nwhich shall be the second Tuesday of June.\r\n\r\nState executive officers elected at a general election shall enter\r\nupon the duties of their respective offices the first of February\r\nnext thereafter; members of the House of Delegates and all county,\r\ncorporation, and district officers on the first of January, and\r\nSenators on the second Wednesday in January next thereafter; and\r\nmayors and councils of cities and towns on the first of September\r\nnext succeeding their election. State executive officers elected\r\nby the General Assembly enter upon their duties the first of March\r\nfollowing their election.\r\n\r\nThey shall continue to discharge the duties of their respective\r\noffices until their successors shall have qualified.\r\n\r\nThe BALLOT is the printed list containing the names of all the\r\ncandidates to be voted for at an election. The places where the\r\npeople vote are called POLLS, and they are kept open for one day--\r\nfrom sunrise to sunset. At the polls there are officers called\r\njudges or clerks of election. When the voter goes to the poll on\r\nelection day, one of the judges hands him a ballot. With the\r\nballot he goes alone into a small compartment or BOOTH, where\r\nthere is a desk with a pencil or pen and ink. There he draws a\r\nmark with the pen or pencil through the names of the candidates he\r\ndoes not wish to vote for, leaving the names of the candidates he\r\nvotes for unmarked He then, folds up the ballot, with the names of\r\nthe candidates on the inside, and hands it to one of the judges,\r\nwho drops it into a box, where it remains until the votes are\r\ncounted after the poll closes. The candidates who receive the\r\nhighest number of votes are declared elected. This is done by the\r\nBoard of State Canvassers (which see).\r\n\r\nSTATE OFFICERS are officers elected by the voters of the whole\r\nState. The governor, the lieutenant-governor, and attorney-general\r\nare State officers.\r\n\r\nA CORPORATION is a body or number of persons formed and authorized\r\nby law to carry on business under one name as a single person.\r\nBanks and railroad and manufacturing companies are corporations.\r\nThey are called private corporations because the business they do\r\nis for the benefit of private individuals. The people of cities\r\nand towns have power by law to carry on the government of their\r\ncities and towns as corporations. They are called public\r\ncorporations because they are formed for the purpose of\r\ngovernment, and act for the whole people (see under Government of\r\nCities and Towns)\r\n\r\nQUALIFIED, with regard to State officers, means having taken the\r\noath of office. The Constitution requires that every person,\r\nbefore entering upon the discharge of any functions as an officer\r\nof the State, must solemnly swear or affirm that he will support\r\nand maintain the Constitution and laws of the State of Virginia,\r\nand that he will faithfully perform the duty of the office to\r\nwhich he has been elected. To take this oath is to QUALIFY for the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe State is entitled to two U. S. Senators and ten\r\nRepresentatives in Congress, and to twelve votes for President and\r\nVice-President in the Electoral College.\r\n\r\nThe ELECTORAL COLLEGE is the name given to the body of persons who\r\nelect the President and Vice-President of the United States. At a\r\npresidential election, which takes place every four years, the\r\npeople do not vote directly for the candidates who have been\r\nnominated for President and Vice-President. They vote for persons\r\nnominated to be ELECTORS, and each State has the right to choose\r\nas many electors as it has senators and representatives in\r\nCongress. Virginia has two senators and ten representatives in\r\nCongress, therefore at the presidential election it chooses twelve\r\nelectors. This is what is meant by saying that it has twelve votes\r\nin the Electoral College.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Electoral College do not meet all together to\r\nelect the President and Vice-President. The electors of each State\r\nmeet in the capital of their own State in January after they are\r\nelected, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President.\r\nafter which they send lists to the President of the United States\r\nSenate showing how they have voted. Those lists are examined in\r\nthe Senate and the votes counted. Then the candidates who have\r\nreceived the votes of a majority of the Electoral College are\r\ndeclared elected.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. From whom are the powers of government derived?\r\n\r\n2. What are magistrates?\r\n\r\n3. For what is government instituted?\r\n\r\n4. What are fundamental principles?\r\n\r\n5.

What is the Electoral College?\r\n\r\n27. How do the electors choose the President and Vice-President of\r\nthe United States?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legislative power of the commonwealth is vested in a General\r\nAssembly consisting of a Senate and House of Delegates.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE POWER is the power to legislate or make LAWS, hence\r\nthe General Assembly is the LEGISLATURE of Virginia. COMMONWEALTH,\r\nwhich means COMMON WELL-BEING, or common good, is a name sometimes\r\ngiven to a State or country which has a republican form of\r\ngovernment--that is, a government in which the people are the\r\nsupreme power, and in which all the people have common (that is,\r\nequal) interests and common rights. CONSISTING means formed or\r\nmade up of.\r\n\r\nA DELEGATE is a person appointed or elected by others to do\r\nbusiness for them as their representative. The members of the\r\nHouse of Delegates are elected by the people of the State to\r\nrepresent and act for them in the business of making laws.\r\n\r\nThe Senate.\r\n\r\nNumber. There are forty Senators, from thirty-nine senatorial\r\ndistricts. The Lieutenant-Governor is the presiding officer.\r\n\r\nElected. By the people; one-half being chosen every two years\r\nuntil the general election in 1907. At that time, and every four\r\nyears thereafter, the entire senate will be chosen at one time for\r\na term of four years.\r\n\r\nQualifications. A Senator must be an actual resident of the\r\ndistrict for which he is elected; must be legally qualified to\r\nvote for members of the General Assembly; must hold no salaried\r\noffice under the State government.\r\n\r\nPowers. Shall select its own officers; choose from its own body,\r\nin the absence of the Lieutenant-Governor, or when he exercises\r\nthe office of Governor, a president PRO TEMPORE; confirms or\r\nrejects nominations; has sole power to try impeachment.\r\n\r\nSENATORIAL DISTRICTS are the districts into which a State is\r\ndivided for the election of senators. There are thirty-nine\r\ndistricts in Virginia, and each of them elects one senator, except\r\nthe district formed of Richmond and the County of Henrico, which\r\nelects two. PRESIDING OFFICER is a person who PRESIDES or acts as\r\npresident or chairman in any assembly or meeting.\r\n\r\nA candidate for the Senate must be LEGALLY QUALIFIED TO VOTE for\r\nmembers of the General Assembly. This means that he must be a\r\ncitizen of the United States, a resident of Virginia for two\r\nyears, and have the other legal qualifications of voters as\r\nrequired by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nPRO TEMPORE is a Latin phrase meaning FOR THE TIME--that is, for a\r\nshort time or temporarily. The Senate elects one of its own\r\nmembers to preside PRO TEMPORE if the lieutenant-governor happen\r\nto be absent, or when he is called upon to act as governor. (See\r\nunder Powers and Duties of governor, page 28.) The Senate has the\r\npower to CONFIRM OR REJECT NOMINATIONS. Many public officers of\r\nthe State are appointed by the governor, but when he nominates or\r\nNAMES a person for a public office he sends the nomination to the\r\nSenate, and it may confirm--that is, approve of--the nomination,\r\nor it may reject it. If it should reject the nomination, the\r\nperson nominated is not appointed.\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT means a charge of dishonesty or serious neglect of\r\nduty made against a public official. In an impeachment it is the\r\nHouse of Delegates which must make the charge and act as\r\nprosecutor, but it is the Senate which must try the case and pass\r\nsentence on the accused, if proved guilty.\r\n\r\nHouse of Delegates.\r\n\r\nNumber. Composed of one hundred members apportioned by statute\r\namong the counties and cities of the State.\r\n\r\nElected. By the people for two years.\r\n\r\nQualifications. Same as for Senators.\r\n\r\nPowers. Elects its own Speaker and all other officers; impeaches\r\nState officers, and prosecutes them before the Senate. The Clerk\r\nof the House of Delegates is also Keeper of the Rolls.\r\n\r\nApportioned means divided or distributed or allotted. A statute is\r\nany law, but the word is most commonly understood to mean a law\r\nmade by a legislature representing the people. The number of\r\ndelegates appointed to the counties and cities--that is, the\r\nnumber which each is entitled to elect--is decided by statute in\r\nproportion to the number of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the House of Delegates is called the speaker. The\r\nsame title is given to the presiding officer of the lower house in\r\nnearly every legislature in English-speaking countries.\r\n\r\nThe rolls are the statutes in written form as passed by the\r\nAssembly. A law when proposed in the Assembly is called a bill. To\r\nbecome a statute a bill must be voted on and have a majority three\r\ntimes in the House of Delegates and three times in the Senate and\r\nbe signed by the governor. Then it is an act, or a Statute, or a\r\nlaw. The copy signed by the governor is an engrossed or written\r\ncopy, and the official copies of the laws so engrossed are the\r\nrolls, and are preserved by the keeper of the rolls, who is the\r\nclerk of the House of Delegates.\r\n\r\nGeneral Assembly. (Senate and House jointly.)\r\n\r\nSessions. Biennial. Beginning the second Wednesday in January of\r\nevery even year, and continuing sixty days. The session may be\r\nextended not exceeding thirty days. It may be convened in special\r\nsession by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Delegates jointly--that is, both together\r\n--are called the General Assembly. Sessions means sittings or\r\nmeetings for business, and biennial means happening once every two\r\nyears. The General Assembly meets once every two years, and it\r\ndoes business for sixty days. If the business necessary to be done\r\nrequire more time, the session may be extended--that is,\r\nlengthened--thirty days. A special session is a session convened--\r\nthat is, called to meet--for some special or particular business.\r\nThe governor may convene such a session whenever he thinks it\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nPowers. General powers of legislation under the constitution.\r\nElects U. S. Senators, County and City Electoral Boards, Auditor\r\nof Public Accounts, Second Auditor, Register of the Land Office,\r\nSuperintendent of Public Printing, the Judges of the Commonwealth;\r\ndecides contests in the election of Governor and Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor; confirms or rejects nominations of certain officers made\r\nby the Governor, the State Board of Education, etc.\r\n\r\nPowers means what the General Assembly has power to do.\r\nLegislation is the making of laws. The Assembly has powers of\r\ngeneral legislation under the constitution--that is, of making all\r\nsuch laws as the constitution directs or does not forbid.\r\n(Explanations are given later on as to the boards and officers\r\nmentioned here which the General Assembly has power to elect.)\r\n\r\nContests--that is, disputes or differences--may occur in the\r\nelection of governor and lieutenant-governor. There may be\r\ncontests as to counting of votes or as to the qualifications of\r\ncandidates. Such contests are decided by the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nMembership. Each house settles its own rules of proceeding; is\r\njudge of the election, qualification, and returns of its members.\r\nMembers are not subject to arrest under any civil process during\r\nthe session of the General Assembly, nor for fifteen days next\r\nbefore the convening, and after the termination of each session;\r\nare privileged from arrest in all cases during the session, except\r\nfor treason, felony, perjury, breach of the peace, or a contempt\r\nof court of a criminal nature.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by each house being judge of the election,\r\nqualification, and returns of its members is, that it can decide\r\nwhether the members are legally elected and qualified. Returns are\r\nthe particulars as to names of candidates and the number of votes\r\ncast for each, which the election judges are required to make up\r\nafter the close of the poll on election day. The qualifications\r\nnecessary for a member of either house are as follows: he must be\r\ntwenty-one years of age or over, and a voter of the State of\r\nVirginia, and he must reside in the district for which he is\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nCivil process is a law-proceeding in a case where no crime is\r\ncharged, but such as for the recovering of a debt or for the\r\nsettlement of a difference relating to business matters. Perjury\r\nis the crime of wilfully making a false oath. When a person\r\nappears as a witness in a court of law he has to take an oath that\r\nhe will tell the truth. If after taking such oath he tells what he\r\nknows to be untrue, he is guilty of perjury.\r\n\r\nA breach of the peace is any act of violence which causes public\r\ndisturbance, such as one person assaulting another and thereby\r\ncausing a quarrel or riot.\r\n\r\nContempt of court is disobedience to the orders or decrees or\r\nrules of a court of law. Insult or violence to a judge in court\r\nwould he criminal contempt.\r\n\r\nSalaries. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House\r\nof Delegates, each, $400; and the other members, each, $240 for\r\nattendance and service at each regular session; at all extra\r\nsessions, the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of\r\nDelegates shall receive, each, $240, and the other members, each,\r\n$120. Members are entitled to mileage.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his salary each member of the Assembly receives ten\r\ncents per mile for expenses of traveling to and from the sessions\r\nof the Assembly. This allowance is called mileage.\r\n\r\nBills may originate in either of the two houses. No bill shall\r\nbecome a law until it has been read on three different days in\r\neach house except by a vote of four-fifths of the members voting\r\nin each house.\r\n\r\nEvery bill which shall have passed the Senate and House of\r\nDelegates shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the\r\nGovernor; if he approve, he shall sign it and it is then a law,\r\nbut if not, he shall return it with his objections to the house in\r\nwhich it originated; who shall proceed to reconsider it. If after\r\nsuch consideration two-thirds of the members present shall agree\r\nto pass the bill, it shall be sent to the other house, by which it\r\nshall be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of all the\r\nmembers present, it shall become a law, notwithstanding the\r\nobjections of the Governor.\r\n\r\nHe may also veto any particular item of an appropriation bill, but\r\nthis item may also be passed over his veto by a two-thirds vote of\r\nboth houses.\r\n\r\nIf any bill shall not be returned by the Governor within five days\r\nafter it shall have been presented to him, it shall be a law in\r\nlike manner as if he had signed it.\r\n\r\nA bill is a draft or statement of a proposed law. A bill may\r\noriginate in either house--that is, it may be first proposed in\r\neither the Seriate or House of Delegates. Any senator or delegate\r\nwho wishes to have a new law made must first put it in writing.\r\nThen he himself introduces or proposes it in the house of which he\r\nis a member, or it may be introduced by a committee.\r\n\r\nA committee is a number of persons, usually not a large number,\r\nappointed by a legislature or other body to take charge of and\r\nattend to some particular business. The members of the House of\r\nDelegates and of the Senate are divided into committees, and some\r\nspecial subject or business is entrusted to each. For example, in\r\nthe Senate there are committees on Privileges and Elections,\r\nPublic Institutions and Education, and many other subjects; and in\r\nthe House of Delegates there are committees on Courts of Justice,\r\nSchools and Colleges, and other subjects.\r\n\r\nUsually proposals for new laws are referred for consideration to\r\nthe committee having charge of the subject or business to which\r\nthe proposed law relates. Committees in the Senate are elected by\r\nthe senators themselves; committees in the House of Delegates are\r\nappointed by the speaker.\r\n\r\nWhen a new law or bill is introduced it is either proposed by a\r\ncommittee, or by some member and given for consideration to a\r\ncommittee. In order to pass, it must be read three times on three\r\ndifferent days (once each day) in the house in which it\r\noriginates.\r\n\r\nThe first reading is the formal placing or presenting of the bill\r\nbefore the house. At the second reading the bill is discussed, and\r\nany member who wishes to say anything for or against it is at\r\nliberty to do so.\r\n\r\nAmendments may also be proposed at the second reading. An\r\namendment is an alteration or a change in the wording or matter of\r\na bill. After an amendment is discussed the house votes upon it,\r\nand if a majority is for it, the change is made in the bill.\r\n\r\nWhen all amendments are discussed and voted on, a vote is taken on\r\nthe bill as a whole, and if a majority of the members vote for it,\r\nit is read a second time.\r\n\r\nIt is then engrossed, or written out, by the clerk of the house,\r\nand read a third time, after which a vote is again taken, and if\r\nthere is a majority for it, it passes the house.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill is passed in the house in which it originated, it is\r\ntaken to the other house by the sergeant-at-arms. There it goes\r\nthrough the same forms of reading and discussion, and if it be\r\nread three times and have a majority in its favor it is passed. It\r\nis then enrolled, after which it is signed by the presiding\r\nofficer in each house, and when this is done it is sent to the\r\ngovernor for his signature.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-at-arms is an officer whose duty it is to preserve\r\norder in the chamber where the sessions of either house are held,\r\nto distribute among the members any papers or documents they may\r\nrequire, and in general to perform such services as are necessary\r\nfor the proper transaction of business. Each house has its own\r\nsergeant-at-arms.\r\n\r\n(For enrolling, see under House of Delegates, page 19.) The\r\nrequirements with regard to a bill after it is sent to the\r\ngovernor are stated in the text above. (For the veto power of the\r\ngovernor, see page 28.)\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

Must reside at the seat of\r\ngovernment during his term of office; not eligible for the next\r\nsucceeding term. Salary, $5,000 a year. He shall receive no other\r\nemolument from this or any other government.\r\n\r\nThe seat of government is the city or town in which the\r\nLegislature holds its sessions. Richmond is the seat of government\r\nof the State of Virginia. Term is the period of time for which a\r\npublic officer is elected. The term of the governor is four years.\r\nHe is not eligible--that is, he cannot be elected--for the next\r\nsucceeding term--that is, he cannot be governor for two terms, one\r\nimmediately following the other. Emolument is salary or\r\ncompensation or pay.\r\n\r\nQualifications. Must be at least thirty years of age; must be a\r\ncitizen of the United States; must have been for the five years\r\nnext preceding his election a resident of the State. If of foreign\r\nbirth, he must have been a citizen of the United States for the\r\nten years next preceding his election.\r\n\r\nForeign birth means birth in any country outside the United\r\nStates. But the children of American citizens are citizens of the\r\nUnited States, even though they have been born in another country.\r\n\r\nPowers and Duties. The chief executive officer of the\r\ncommonwealth; shall take care that the laws are faithfully\r\nexecuted; shall communicate to the General Assembly, at every\r\nsession, the condition of the commonwealth, and recommend such\r\nmeasures as he may deem expedient; may call special sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly; shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Land and\r\nNaval Forces of the State; may embody the militia to repel\r\ninvasion, suppress insurrection, and enforce, the execution of the\r\nlaws; shall conduct all intercourse with other and foreign states;\r\nmay fill temporarily, during the recess of the General Assembly,\r\nall vacancies in those offices for which the constitution and laws\r\nmake no provision; may remit fines and penalties, grant reprieves\r\nand pardons, remove political disabilities, and commute capital\r\npunishment; shall attest all commissions and grants; signs or\r\nvetoes bills passed by the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe governor is the chief executive officer. He is called chief\r\nbecause he is the highest public officer of the State, and\r\nexecutive because it is his duty to execute or carry out the laws.\r\nIt is also his duty to send what is called a message to each\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The message is a letter or\r\nstatement in which he communicates to the Assembly full\r\ninformation as to the condition of the State, and recommends such\r\nmeasures--that is, such new laws--as he thinks necessary.\r\n\r\nMilitia is a body composed of citizens enrolled and trained as\r\nsoldiers for the defence of the State. All able-bodied male\r\npersons between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years may be\r\ncalled to serve in the militia. Naval forces are military forces\r\nor militia that serve on sea.\r\n\r\nInvasion is the entrance into a State of a military force from\r\nanother country for the purpose of conquest. To repel invasion is\r\nto oppose it by force, to drive off the invaders. Insurrection is\r\na rising or rebellion of people in a State against the government\r\nof their own State. It is the duty of the governor to suppress--\r\nthat is, to put down--insurrection, and to ENFORCE the EXECUTION\r\nof the laws--that is, to carry out the laws by force if necessary.\r\nINTERCOURSE is correspondence with others by letter or message.\r\nWhen it is necessary to have intercourse with another State or a\r\nforeign country, the governor, as the chief executive and highest\r\nrepresentative of the people, is the person who conducts such\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nThe recess of the General Assembly is the time when it is not in\r\nsession. During recess of the Assembly, the governor may fill\r\nvacancies in public offices for which the Constitution and laws\r\nmake no provision. For example, the Constitution and laws make no\r\nprovision for the appointment of judges during the recess of\r\nAssembly; therefore, if a judge dies during the recess, the\r\ngovernor appoints a person to fill the vacancy until the Assembly\r\nmeets and elects a new judge.\r\n\r\nA FINE is a PENALTY or punishment in the form of payment of money.\r\nSometimes a person convicted of an offence against the law is\r\nordered by the judge to pay a sum of money instead of being sent\r\nto jail. This is called a FINE. But it may happen that the person\r\nis convicted by mistake or by false evidence, or that the fine is\r\ntoo heavy for the person to pay. In such cases the governor may\r\nREMIT the FINES--that is, release or free the persons from having\r\nto pay.\r\n\r\nThe governor may also GRANT REPRIEVES AND PARDONS if he sees good\r\nreason for doing so. A reprieve is a delay of punishment. When a\r\nperson is convicted of murder, the judge sentences him to be put\r\nto death on a certain day. But there may be reason for further\r\ninquiry into the case, and to give time for such inquiry the\r\ngovernor may postpone the execution of the sentence--that is, put\r\nit off to another day. This is called a reprieve. If the further\r\ninquiry should prove that the person is innocent, a full pardon is\r\ngranted and the person is set free.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL DISABILITIES are punishments which deprive persons of\r\ncertain rights of citizenship. A citizen convicted of bribery in\r\nan election, embezzlement of public funds, treason, felony, or\r\npetit larceny, is by the law of Virginia deprived of the right of\r\nvoting. This is a POLITICAL DISABILITY. The person convicted is\r\nlegally DISABLED to vote. The governor may remove the disability,\r\nand this restores to the person his right of voting. The governor\r\nmay also COMMUTE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. To COMMUTE is to CHANGE, and\r\nCAPITAL PUNISHMENT is the punishment of DEATH--the punishment\r\ninflicted on persons convicted of murder. The governor may order\r\nthat instead of being put to death the convict be imprisoned for\r\nlife, or for a number of years. (A convict is a person CONVICTED\r\nor found guilty of crime.)\r\n\r\nThe governor shall ATTEST ALL COMMISSIONS AND GRANTS. To ATTEST is\r\nto certify, or bear witness to, and a COMMISSION is a written\r\npaper giving power or authority to some person or persons to\r\nperform a public duty. When a judge is elected he receives a\r\ncommission authorizing him to act as such, and the governor\r\nattests the commission by signing his name to it. GRANTS or gifts,\r\nsuch as grants of public lands or money for educational or other\r\npublic objects, are also made in writing, and must be attested by\r\nthe governor. (Commissions and other important papers must have\r\nupon them an impression of the seal of the State. The seal is a\r\ncircular piece of metal made like a medal or large coin and\r\nbearing on each side certain figures and mottoes. The impression\r\nof the seal shows that the paper has been officially attested or\r\ncertified.)\r\n\r\nThe VETO power is one of the most important powers possessed by\r\nthe governor. When a bill is passed by the General Assembly it is\r\nsent to the governor for his signature. If he SIGN it--that is,\r\nwrites his name upon it--it is then a law. If he VETO the bill, or\r\nany item contained in it appropriating money, the bill, or such\r\npart of it as is vetoed, cannot become a law until it is again\r\npassed by a two-thirds vote of both houses. (VETO is a Latin word\r\nmeaning I FORBID.)\r\n\r\nIn case the Governor dies, or is in any way incapacitated for\r\nperforming the duties of his office, the Lieutenant-Governor shall\r\nact; and in case of the inability of both, the President PRO\r\nTEMPORE of the Senate shall act.\r\n\r\nINCAPACITATED for office means legally disqualified. The governor\r\nwould be incapacitated if he should refuse to qualify by taking\r\nthe necessary oath, or if he should reside out of the State, or if\r\nhe should be convicted on impeachment.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\nElected. At the same time and for the same term as the Governor,\r\nand his qualifications and the manner of his election in all\r\nrespects shall be the same.\r\n\r\nHe shall be the President of the Senate, but shall have no vote,\r\nexcept in case of an equal division.\r\n\r\nFor the same term means for the same length of time. The governor\r\nis elected for four years. That is his term of office. The term of\r\nthe lieutenant-governor is the same.\r\n\r\nAn equal division is an equal number voting for and against the\r\nsame proposal. If a bill is proposed in the Senate and twenty\r\nsenators vote for and twenty against it, that is an equal\r\ndivision. In such case, and in no other case, the president votes.\r\nHe may vote on either side he pleases, and his vote is called a\r\ncasting vote.\r\n\r\nATTORNEY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nElected. By the people for four years. Salary, $2,500 and mileage.\r\n\r\nDuties. Shall give his opinion and advice when required to do so\r\nby the Governor, or by any of the public boards and officers at\r\nthe seat of government; shall appear as counsel for the State in\r\nall cases in which the commonwealth is interested, depending in\r\nthe Supreme Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, the District and Circuit Courts of the United States for\r\nthe State of Virginia, and shall discharge such other duties as\r\nmay be imposed by the General Assembly. Member of the State Board\r\nof Education.\r\n\r\nAn attorney is a person who acts for and in the place of another.\r\nThe word is usually applied to a lawyer who is employed by another\r\nto act for him in any law business he wishes to have done. An\r\nattorney who appears in a court of law and acts or defends a\r\nperson, or acts against a person accused of crime, is called a\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general is a lawyer who is elected to do law business\r\nfor the State. He must appear in court as counsel for the State in\r\nevery case in which the commonwealth (meaning the whole people) is\r\ninterested. The commonwealth is interested in every case of crime,\r\nbecause it is for the interest or well-being of the people that\r\nthose who commit crime should be punished. If this were not done--\r\nif criminals, persons who commit murder or burglary or theft--were\r\nnot arrested and punished, no man's life or property would be\r\nsafe. The attorney-general must appear and act for the\r\ncommonwealth in any of the courts above mentioned whenever there\r\nis a case in any of them in which the people of the State are\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nDepending or pending with reference to a case means that the case\r\nis in court waiting to be tried or decided. (For information as to\r\nSupreme Court of Appeals and Circuit Court of the City of\r\nRichmond, mentioned above, see under Judiciary Department.)\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court of the\r\nUnited States. Its members or judges are appointed by the\r\nPresident and hold office for life, and it sits at Washington and\r\ntries cases in which any person or persons are accused of\r\nviolating the Constitution of the United States. The members of\r\nthe district and circuit courts of the United States are also\r\nappointed by the President. These courts sit in various districts\r\nof States, and try cases in which persons are accused of violating\r\nthe laws of the United States--that is, the laws made by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe word circuit means a going round. A district in which the same\r\njudges go round at certain times and hold courts in several places\r\nis called a circuit, and the courts so held are called circuit\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

EXECUTIVE ACTS are official acts of the governor. The\r\nsecretary of the commonwealth must make records of such acts and\r\npreserve them in his office. He must sign his own name after the\r\nsignature of the governor on all official documents. This is\r\ncalled ATTESTING the signature.\r\n\r\nThere are two SEALS OF THE COMMONWEALTH. One is called the GREAT\r\nSEAL, and the other the LESSER SEAL. (For form and description of\r\nseal, see under POWERS AND DUTIES of governor, page 28.) The great\r\nseal is much larger in size than the lesser. It is affixed to\r\ndocuments signed by the governor which are to be used for purposes\r\noutside the jurisdiction of the State, or, for example, in a\r\nUnited States court, or in another State or foreign country. The\r\nlesser seal is affixed to public documents signed by the governor\r\nwhich are issued for use within the State.\r\n\r\nCLERICAL DUTIES are the duties of writing letters, records, and\r\nother papers or documents. A GENERAL LIBRARIAN is one who has\r\ngeneral charge or control of a library. The LIBRARY FUND is the\r\nbooks and maps belonging to the State. These are kept in the State\r\nlibrary at the capital, and the secretary of the commonwealth is\r\nthe librarian.\r\n\r\nELECTION RETURNS when made up by the judges of election are sent\r\nto the commissioners of elections and afterwards to the Board of\r\nState Canvassers. The board determines and decides who have been\r\nelected, and the secretary must KEEP A RECORD of the Board's\r\nDETERMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nAfter the election returns are examined by the State board, the\r\nsecretary makes out CERTIFICATES OF ELECTION for certain State\r\nofficers elected at the polls.

The building in which the money is kept\r\nand in which the treasurer has his office is called the treasury.\r\nThe treasurer also disburses money. To disburse is to pay out, and\r\nthe treasurer cannot disburse without a warrant from the auditor\r\n(see next section).\r\n\r\nThe warrant is a writing giving the treasurer power to pay money.\r\nThe treasurer pays the interest on State bonds. A bond is a\r\nwritten paper by which a person binds or pledges himself to pay a\r\ncertain sum of money before a certain day. Sometimes the\r\ngovernment has to borrow money, and when it does so it issues\r\nbonds to the persons who loan the money. In these bonds the\r\ngovernment binds itself to pay the money by a certain time, and to\r\npay a certain amount every year as interest until the principal\r\n(the full amount borrowed) is paid back.\r\n\r\nThe sinking fund is money set apart at certain times to pay the\r\ndebts due by the government. It is in charge of officers called\r\ncommissioners. These commissioners hold bonds for debts due to the\r\ngovernment on account of the sale of public lands, and the\r\ninterest of the State in railroads and other corporations. Express\r\ncompanies and insurance companies whose head-quarters are in\r\nforeign countries, and who do business in Virginia, are required\r\nto give bonds to the State as security that their obligations to\r\ncitizens of the State shall be honestly carried out.\r\n\r\nAUDITOR OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS.\r\n\r\nElected.

Such claims\r\nmade against the commonwealth are not paid until they are examined\r\nby the auditor of the public accounts. Claims that are chargeable\r\n--that is, to be charged--against the Board of Education, the\r\nCorporation Commission, or corporations of government officers,\r\nare not audited by the auditor of public accounts, but by the\r\nsecond auditor (see next section).

The bond is then cancelled. To cancel is to\r\ndeface or destroy so that the paper or bond cannot be used again.\r\n\r\nA security is something given or deposited as a pledge that money\r\nloaned shall be repaid. Debts may be due to the sinking fund by\r\nrailroad or other companies in which the State has an interest,\r\nand securities have to be given that such debts shall be paid.\r\n\r\nThe literary fund was formed in 1810 from the sale of public\r\nlands, some of which had been possessed by the Church in colonial\r\ntimes. The fund has since been increased by the sale of lands\r\ngiven to the State by Congress for public school purposes. and by\r\nfines collected for offences committed against the State, and by\r\ndonations made by private individuals.

Shall have original jurisdiction in cases of habeas\r\ncorpus, mandamus, and prohibition; shall have appellate\r\njurisdiction in all cases involving the constitutionality of a law\r\nwith reference to the Constitution of the State or the United\r\nStates, or involving the life or liberty of a person, and in other\r\ncases prescribed by law. Shall not have jurisdiction in civil\r\ncases where the amount in controversy, exclusive of costs, is less\r\nthan $300, unless such controversy relates to the title or\r\nboundary of land; or the probate of a will; or the appointment or\r\nqualification of a personal representative, guardian, committee,\r\nor curator; or a mill, roadway, ferry, or landing; or the right of\r\nthe state, county or municipal corporation to levy tolls or taxes;\r\nor involves the construction of a law, ordinance, or proceeding\r\nimposing taxes; and, except in cases of habeas corpus, mandamus,\r\nor prohibition, the constitutionality of a law, or some other\r\nmatter not merely pecuniary.\r\n\r\nJURISDICTION means the power of a judge or of a court of law.\r\nAPPELLATE jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and decide\r\ncases of APPEAL against the decisions of lower courts.\r\n\r\nThis is the principal business of the Supreme Court of Appeals. In\r\ntrials in the lower courts it frequently happens that the judge\r\ngives a decision which some lawyer acting in the case may think is\r\nnot in accordance with law, or is not fair to his client. Whenever\r\nthis happens, the lawyer may take the case to the Supreme Court of\r\nAppeals and ask the judges there to set aside the decision of the\r\njudge in the lower court. In cases of appeal, the court in which\r\nthe decision appealed against has been given is called the LOWER\r\nCOURT, A person who employs a lawyer to act for him in any law\r\nbusiness is called a CLIENT.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court, after hearing the complaint or appeal against\r\nthe decision of the lower court, considers the case and gives\r\njudgment on the question. This judgment is final--that is, it ends\r\nthe case--unless there is some point in the question which has to\r\ndo with the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nA writ is a paper issued by a judge, or court, commanding some\r\nperson or persons to do something, or to abstain from doing\r\nsomething. Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning you may have\r\nthe body. A writ of habeas corpus is an order from a court\r\ndirected usually to a warden or keeper of a prison, and commanding\r\nhim to bring some particular prisoner before the court so that it\r\nmay be decided whether there is just cause for his detention.\r\n\r\nA mandamus is an order from a superior court to any person,\r\ncorporation, or inferior--that is, lower--court requiring them to\r\ndo something which it is part of their duty to do. A writ of\r\nprohibition is an order from a superior court prohibiting an\r\ninferior court from hearing or deciding a case, on the ground that\r\nit (the inferior court) has no jurisdiction in such case.\r\n\r\nWhen the amount in controversy between two parties is less than\r\n$300, exclusive of costs--that is, excluding or not counting\r\ncosts--the case cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court. In such\r\ncases that court has no jurisdiction. The idea of this law is that\r\nfor sums less than $300 it would be absurd to go to the Supreme\r\nCourt, as the costs might be greater than the sum in dispute. But\r\nif the dispute be about the title or boundary of land, or any of\r\nthe other matters mentioned in the remainder of the sentence, the\r\ncase may go before the Supreme Court of Appeals, even though the\r\nsum mentioned in the case be less than $300.\r\n\r\nThe title of land is the right of ownership, and a paper\r\ncertifying that a person is the owner of certain land is a title\r\ndeed. The probate of a will is the proof or proving of a will. A\r\nwill is a statement, generally in writing, in which a persons\r\ndeclares his will, or wish, as to how he desires his property to\r\nbe disposed of after his death. Wills must be probated--that is,\r\nproved in the proper court--before they can be legally executed.\r\n\r\nA personal representative is one who executes a will (carries out\r\nthe directions contained in it) or administers the estate or\r\nproperty of a deceased person. A guardian in law is one appointed\r\nby a court to take charge of and administer the property of\r\npersons who are not of sufficient age or understanding to manage\r\ntheir own affairs. A committee in law is one entrusted with the\r\ncare of an idiot or a lunatic. Used in this sense, the word is\r\npronounced com-mit-tee. A curator is one appointed to act as\r\nguardian of the estate of a person not legally competent\r\n(qualified) to manage his property, or of the estate of an\r\nabsentee.\r\n\r\nTo levy means to raise or collect. Each county in the State has\r\nthe right to levy tolls and taxes to pay the cost of carrying on\r\nits government. The constitutionality of a law is its agreement\r\nwith the Constitution. The Supreme Court of Appeals has the\r\njurisdiction to decide, when appealed to, whether any law is\r\nconstitutional or not--that is, whether or not it is allowed by\r\nthe Constitution of the State of Virginia.\r\n\r\nCircuit Courts.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-four judicial circuits, with a judge for each\r\ncircuit. The judge must reside in the circuit for which he is\r\nelected; shall not hold any other office or public trust; shall\r\nnot practice law. Elected by the General Assembly for terms of\r\neight years. Salary, $2,500, except the judge of the circuit which\r\nincludes the city of Richmond, who receives $3,500. Circuit judges\r\nare entitled to mileage.\r\n\r\nTerms. There shall be at least five terms in each county and two\r\nterms in each year in each city except in cities of the second\r\nclass that have their own courts.\r\n\r\nFor explanation of circuits, see under Attorney-General, page 30.\r\n\r\nThe term of a court is its regular session, or sitting, for the\r\nhearing and trying of cases. The word court means not only the\r\nroom or hall in which a judge sits to try cases, but it means the\r\njudge while sitting in court, or a number of judges sitting in\r\ncourt together. An order of the court means an order given\r\nofficially by a judge.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction. Shall have original jurisdiction for the trial of\r\nall presentments, informations and indictments for felonies; of\r\nall cases in chancery and civil cases at law, except cases to\r\nrecover personal property or money of less value than $20; of all\r\ncases for the recovery of fees, penalties, etc.; of questions\r\nregarding the validity of ordinances and by-laws of a corporation;\r\nor involving the right to levy taxes; and all cases civil or\r\ncriminal when an appeal may be had to the Supreme Court of\r\nAppeals. Also, of all proceedings by quo warranto; and may issue\r\nwrits of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, and certiorari to\r\nall inferior tribunals; issue writs of mandamus in all matters\r\narising from or appertaining to the action of the board of\r\nsupervisors; determines the probate of wills and testamentary\r\ncases; may appoint guardians, curators, commissioners in chancery,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAppellate jurisdiction of all cases, civil and criminal, where an\r\nappeal writ of error or supersedeas may be taken or allowed by\r\nsaid courts from or to the judgment or proceedings of an inferior\r\ntribunal. But no circuit court shall have any original or\r\nappellate jurisdiction in criminal cases arising within the\r\nterritorial limits of any city wherein there is established by law\r\na corporation or hustings court.\r\n\r\nOriginal jurisdiction means jurisdiction from the beginning of a\r\ncase--that is, power to take up and try it when it is first\r\nentered in law. The Supreme Court of Appeals has not this power.\r\nIt can deal only with cases that have already been tried in some\r\nother court. But the circuit courts may try cases on their first\r\nhearing. This is original jurisdiction. They have also general\r\njurisdiction--that is, they can try all cases in general in which\r\nthe law is violated, or the protection of the law is sought or\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nA presentment is a notice taken by a grand jury of any offence or\r\ncrime of which they may have knowledge. (For grand jury, see page\r\n70.) The notice is a written statement of the facts, and the\r\nstatement is sent or presented to the court in which the case may\r\nbe tried.\r\n\r\nAfter the presentment is made, the commonwealth's attorney\r\nprepares an indictment. This is a written charge against the\r\naccused person, with full particulars of the crime or offence\r\nalleged. The grand jury next make an investigation of the\r\nindictment by examining witnesses on oath, and if they think that\r\nthe evidence is sufficient to prove the charge against the\r\naccused, they write on the indictment the words a true bill.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the person is found guilty, but that the\r\ngrand jury find the case against the accused is so strong that it\r\nought to be tried by a judge and jury, and so the person is\r\nbrought into court and tried. But if the grand jury find that\r\nthere is not evidence enough to convict the accused, they mark or\r\nindorse the indictment with the words not a true bill, and then\r\nthere is no trial in court.\r\n\r\nAn information is an action or prosecution for some offence\r\nagainst the government, and it is based not on a grand jury\r\nindictment, but on a statement or complaint made on oath by a\r\ncompetent witness.\r\n\r\nIn chancery means in equity--that is, in natural right. A court of\r\nchancery may give a decision or judgment on the ground of plain,\r\ncommon justice between man and man, where there may be no statute\r\nlaw that bears upon the case. This is what is called equity.\r\nPersonal property is movable property, such as furniture, money,\r\netc. Immovable property, such as land or houses, is called real\r\nestate. Circuit courts have no jurisdiction for the recovering of\r\npersonal property of value less than $20, the reason manifestly\r\nbeing that the cost of a circuit court trial of such a case might\r\namount to a much greater sum than the sum in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe circuit courts have appellate jurisdiction in cases appealed\r\nfrom inferior tribunals--that is, lower courts. (For civil case,\r\nsee under General Assembly, page 21.) A criminal case as\r\ndistinguished from a civil case is one in which a person is\r\ncharged with a crime or felony. A writ of error is an appeal\r\nordered on the ground of an error or mistake in the proceedings of\r\na court, either as to a matter of fact or a point of law. A\r\nsupersedeas is a writ, or order, to suspend the powers of an\r\nofficer, or to stay--that is, stop--action under another writ.\r\n\r\nQuo warranto is a Latin phrase, the English of which is by what\r\nwarrant or authority. In law it means a writ brought before a\r\ncourt to inquire by what authority a person or corporation\r\nexercises certain powers. For example, if a person assume the\r\nduties or work of a public office, and it is believed that he has\r\nno legal right to the office, proceedings in quo warranto may be\r\ntaken against him.\r\n\r\nCertiorari is a writ from a superior court in a certain case,\r\nordering the removal of the case from an inferior court, so that\r\nmore speedy justice may be obtained or that errors may be\r\ncorrected. (For charters of incorporation, see under Secretary of\r\nthe Commonwealth, page 33.) A receiver is a person appointed by a\r\ncourt to receive, or hold in trust, property about which law\r\nproceedings are being taken. Commissioners in chancery are\r\ncommissioners or officers appointed from time to time by circuit\r\ncourt judges to examine and report upon accounts (statements\r\nrelating to money) presented as evidence in the trial of a case.\r\n\r\nTestamentary cases are cases about wills. A testament is a written\r\npaper in which a person declares (or testifies) how he wishes his\r\nproperty to be disposed of after his death. Such a paper is\r\nsometimes called a last will and testament. An injunction is an\r\norder of a court requiring a person to do or refrain from doing\r\ncertain acts.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court of the City of Richmond possesses all the powers\r\nof other circuit courts except as to those matters the\r\njurisdiction of which has been exclusively invested in the\r\nChancery or the Hustings Court. It shall also have jurisdiction of\r\nall such suits, motions, prosecutions, and matters and things as\r\nare specially cognizable by it, in which the Commonwealth,\r\nrepresented by certain public officers or public boards, is a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court of the City of Richmond has the same power as\r\nother circuit courts except in matters the jurisdiction of which\r\nbelongs EXCLUSIVELY to the Hustings Court, and the Chancery Court\r\nof the City of Richmond--that is, belongs to them and to no other\r\ncourt. (For explanation as to these matters, see under Hustings\r\nCourt and under Chancery Court.)\r\n\r\nA suit or lawsuit is an action or proceeding--in a court of law to\r\nrecover a right, or to obtain justice in a matter under dispute. A\r\nsuit at law is sometimes also called a cause. A motion (in law) is\r\na carrying on of a suit or action in court to obtain some right,\r\nor to punish persons who have committed crime. Cognizable means\r\nliable to be taken notice of. Matters that are cognizable by a\r\ncourt are cases that it is fit and proper for it to hear, try, and\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nA party to a suit is one of the two opposing persons or sides\r\nengaged in it. In every lawsuit there are at least two parties.\r\nThe party or person that brings on the suit or action is called\r\nthe plaintiff, because he makes a complaint or charge against some\r\none; the party on the other side is called the defendant, because\r\nhe defends himself against the charge.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

Judge\r\nelected by the General Assembly in joint session for a term of\r\neight years. Salary, not less than 12,000 $.\r\n\r\nQualifications of a judge. Same as those of judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Appeals.\r\n\r\nTerms. Held monthly, except that the July or August term may be\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction. Within the territorial limits of the city, same as\r\ncircuit courts have in the counties. Concurrently with the circuit\r\ncourts they have jurisdiction over all offences committed in any\r\ncounty within one mile of the corporate limits of the city.\r\n\r\nCorporation courts, or city courts, are courts whose jurisdiction\r\nlies within corporations or cities, and the judges are called city\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nThere is a corporation court in each city of the first class, and\r\nalso in all cities of the second class in which it has not been by\r\nspecial election or otherwise merged into the circuit court. The\r\nHustings Court of the city of Richmond has a peculiar and limited\r\njurisdiction which is explained later in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe city judges hold office for eight years. Their salaries in\r\ncities of the first class are fixed or specially provided by law\r\nat not less than $2,000, but any city may increase such salary,\r\nbut such increase shall be paid entirely by the city.\r\n\r\nEvery city judge must hold a term or session every month except\r\nJuly or August, in either of which the court term may be omitted--\r\nthat is, not held.\r\n\r\nCities of the first class are such as contain more than 10,000\r\ninhabitants. All other cities are termed cities of the second\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution requires the maintenance of city or corporation\r\ncourts in all cities of the first class, but provides for the\r\ndiscontinuance of independent city courts in all cities of the\r\nsecond class whenever the people vote in favor of their abolition.\r\n\r\nUpon the abolition of the corporation court in any city of the\r\nsecond class, the circuit courts of the circuit in which the city\r\nis located will arrange to hold regular terms in such city the\r\nsame as in cities of the first class.\r\n\r\nWithin their respective limits--that is, each in its own city--\r\nthe corporation courts have the same jurisdiction as the circuit\r\ncourts. This means that they have power to try the same kind of\r\noffences as may be tried in the circuit courts.\r\n\r\nJUSTICES' COURTS.\r\n\r\nHeld by a justice of the peace; in the cities, by the mayor or\r\npolice justice.\r\n\r\nThe judge who sits in & justice's court is called a justice of the\r\npeace, or simply a justice, and sometimes a police justice.\r\nJustices' courts and police courts are the courts in which\r\ngenerally all offences and cases not of a serious nature are tried\r\nand disposed of. (See under Justices of the Peace and under\r\nMagisterial Districts. For mayor, see under Government of Cities\r\nand Towns.)\r\n\r\nJurisdiction. Debt, exclusive of interest, not exceeding $100;\r\nfines, damages, etc., not exceeding $20; have jurisdiction of\r\ncertain cases of unlawful entry and detainer, detinue, and search;\r\nmay allow bail in certain cases. Shall have concurrent\r\njurisdiction with the County and Corporation Courts of the State\r\nin all cases of violations of the revenue laws of the State and of\r\noffences arising under certain provisions of the Code, and\r\nexclusive original jurisdiction for the trial of all other\r\nmisdemeanor cases occurring within their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nA person charged with refusing to pay a debt may be brought before\r\na justice's court if the debt, without interest, is not greater\r\nthan $100, and the justice has power to decide the case. He has\r\nalso power to try cases in which offenders may be punished by\r\nhaving to pay fines or damages of not more than $20.\r\n\r\nDAMAGES means money paid to compensate for the injury or DAMAGE\r\ndone to any person or person's property.\r\n\r\nUNLAWFUL ENTRY is entering unlawfully upon lands belonging to\r\nanother, and UNLAWFUL DETAINER means unlawful detaining or holding\r\npossession of lands or houses belonging to another.\r\n\r\nDETINUE is an action in law in which a person seeks to get back\r\nproperty of his which is unlawfully held or DETAINED by another.\r\nIn such cases the justice may issue a warrant for SEARCH for the\r\nproperty detained.\r\n\r\nA WARRANT is a document or paper issued by a judge giving power or\r\nauthority to a policeman, or other officer of the law, to arrest a\r\ncriminal, or an offender, in order to have him brought to trial. A\r\nwarrant issued authorizing an officer to search for property\r\nstolen or detained, is called a SEARCH WARRANT. BAIL is security\r\ngiven for the release of a person from prison. When a person is\r\narrested and charged with a crime he may, if the crime be not a\r\nvery serious one, be let out of prison and left at liberty until\r\ntrial, if some one will give security or pledge for him that he\r\nwill appear in court on the day appointed for the trial. If the\r\namount required is small, the security is usually given in the\r\nshape of money, but if the amount is large, it is given in the\r\nshape of a bond called a BAIL-BOND.\r\n\r\nThe person giving the bail-bond must be one who owns real estate\r\nto the value of the amount of bail, and if the person to be tried\r\ndoes not appear for trial at the time appointed, the person who\r\ngives the bond may be required to pay the amount into court.\r\n\r\nCONCURRENT jurisdiction is the same or equal jurisdiction. REVENUE\r\nis the income or money which the State or corporation receives in\r\nthe shape of taxes. TAXES are the moneys collected by the State or\r\nby towns or cities for defraying the expenses of government. The\r\nowners of certain kinds of property have to pay taxes in\r\nproportion to the value of their property.\r\n\r\nVIOLATION OF THE REVENUE LAWS is a violation of any of the laws\r\nmade for the levying and collection of taxes. There is a tax upon\r\nthe selling of certain articles, such as liquors and tobacco, and\r\nif a person sells such articles without paying the tax, it is a\r\nviolation of the revenue laws.\r\n\r\nA CODE is a collection of the laws of the State or country. The\r\nCode of Virginia is a book containing the statute laws of\r\nVirginia. A MISDEMEANOR is any crime less than a felony. (For\r\nFELONY, see page 13.)\r\n\r\nHustings Court of the City of Richmond.\r\n\r\nJudge elected by the General Assembly for a term of eight years.\r\nSalary, $3,500.\r\n\r\nQualifications. Same as those of a Circuit Judge. Terms. Held\r\nmonthly except the month of August.\r\n\r\nHUSTINGS is the name given to a court formerly held in many cities\r\nof England, and applied specially to a court held within the City\r\nof London before the Lord Mayor and other magistrates.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction. Exclusive original jurisdiction of all presentments,\r\nindictments, and informations for offences committed within the\r\ncorporate limits (except prosecutions against convicts in the\r\npenitentiary); concurrent jurisdiction of all presentments,\r\nindictments, and informations for offences committed within the\r\nspace of one mile beyond the corporate limits on the north side of\r\nthe James River, and to low-water mark on the south side of James\r\nRiver; concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court of the City\r\nof Richmond of actions of forcible or unlawful entry and detainer;\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of all appeals from the judgments of the\r\nPolice Justice's Court, all causes removable from said court, all\r\nproceedings for the condemnation of land or property for public\r\nuse, all motions to correct erroneous assessments.\r\n\r\nCORPORATE LIMITS are the limits or boundaries of the area over\r\nwhich the corporation has jurisdiction. Here the phrase means the\r\nboundaries of the city of Richmond.\r\n\r\nPROSECUTIONS AGAINST CONVICTS are prosecutions against convicts\r\n(prisoners) for crimes committed within the prison. All such\r\ncrimes are tried in the circuit court of the city of Richmond.\r\n\r\nCAUSES REMOVABLE FROM SAID COURT (police justice's court) are\r\ncases that may at the request of the parties concerned be taken\r\nout of that court and tried in another court.\r\n\r\nThe CONDEMNATION of land or property for public use means the\r\ndeciding by a proper authority (a court or judge) that certain\r\nlands must be given for such use. (See page 12.)\r\n\r\nAn ASSESSMENT is the valuing of property for the purpose of fixing\r\na tax upon it. If any owner of property in Richmond thinks the\r\nvaluation of his property too high, and that therefore the tax is\r\ntoo high, he may object to the assessment as ERRONEOUS and have a\r\nmotion brought before the Hustings Court to have the assessment\r\nCORRECTED.\r\n\r\nChancery Court of the City of Richmond.\r\n\r\nJudge elected by the General Assembly for term of eight years.\r\nSalary, $3,500.\r\n\r\nQualifications. Same as those of a Circuit Judge.\r\n\r\nTerms. Shall hold four terms each year; but shall always be open\r\nas a Court of Probate.\r\n\r\nFor explanation of CHANCERY, see page 50, and for PROBATE, see\r\npage 48.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction. Shall exercise, within the corporate limits,\r\nexclusive jurisdiction concerning the probate and recordation of\r\nwills, the appointment, qualification, and removal of fiduciaries,\r\nand the settlement of their accounts; the docketing of judgments;\r\nthe recordation of deeds and such other papers as are authorized\r\nor required by law to be recorded; exclusive jurisdiction of all\r\nsuits and proceedings in chancery cognizable by law in the Circuit\r\nCourts of the Commonwealth, except such as are specially\r\ncognizable by the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, and any\r\nduty devolved, or any power or jurisdiction conferred by law on\r\nthe Circuit Courts, unless otherwise expressly provided, except as\r\nto matters of common law and criminal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe RECORDATION of wills is the recording of them in the court in\r\nwhich they are probated. (For PROBATE OF WILLS, see page 48.)\r\nFIDUCIARIES are trustees or persons appointed to hold property in\r\ntrust for others. The DOCKETING OF JUDGMENTS is making summaries\r\nor brief statements of them for the purpose of record. A docket is\r\na small piece of paper containing the heads or principal points of\r\nany writing or statement.\r\n\r\nA JUDGMENT is a sentence or decision pronounced by a court, or a\r\njudge of a court, on any matter tried before it. A DEED is a\r\nwritten paper containing the terms of a contract, or the transfer\r\nof real estate by the owner to a purchaser. DEVOLVED means\r\ntransferred from one person to another.\r\n\r\nCOMMON LAW is the title given to laws which have not originated in\r\nany statute, but derive their force and authority from having been\r\nin use for many centuries. The common law of England, upon which\r\nthe common law of Virginia is based, includes customs of the\r\npeople of such long standing that the courts took notice of them\r\nand gave them the force of law. Common law is the UNWRITTEN law;\r\nstatute law consists of the laws enacted and recorded by\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\nLaw and Equity Court of the City of Richmond.\r\n\r\nJudge elected by the General Assembly for a term of eight years.\r\nSalary, $3,500.\r\n\r\nQualifications. Same as those of a Circuit Judge. Terms. Shall\r\nhold four terms each year, beginning the second Monday in\r\nFebruary, May, September, and December, continuing as long as the\r\nbusiness of the Court may require.\r\n\r\nFor EQUITY, see under Circuit Courts, page 50.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction. Shall exercise within the corporate limits original\r\njurisdiction concurrent with the Chancery Court (except as to the\r\nprobate and record of wills; the appointment and qualification of\r\nfiduciaries; the EX PARTE settlement of their accounts; the record\r\nof deeds and other papers authorized or required by law to be\r\nrecorded). Shall have within the same limits original jurisdiction\r\nconcurrent with the Circuit Court, except all such suits, motions,\r\netc., as are specially cognizable by said Court;--has the same\r\npower as to bail, injunctions, etc., as the Circuit Court, and\r\nappeals from its decrees and judgments shall be taken and allowed\r\nas if from a Circuit Court. This Court has no criminal\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nEX PARTE is a Latin phrase signifying from or on one side only. An\r\nex parte hearing in court would be a hearing taken by one side or\r\nparty in the absence of the other. An EX PARTE SETTLEMENT is\r\nsettlement made on the application of one party without notice to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Where are corporation courts held?\r\n\r\n2.

The Clerk of the Court of Appeals is\r\nappointed by the court; the Clerks of the Circuit and Corporation\r\nCourts are elected by the people of the county or corporation in\r\nwhich the court is held. They hold office for a term of eight\r\nyears. Salary, fees and special allowances.\r\n\r\nDuties. Shall record the proceedings of their respective courts\r\nand issue writs in their name; shall be the custodians of all\r\npapers lawfully returned to or filed in the Clerk's office; shall\r\nperform such other duties as are imposed upon them by law.\r\n\r\nThe Tipstaff and Crier are the executive officers of the Court of\r\nAppeals.\r\n\r\nFor meaning of DOCKET, see under Chancery Court of the City of\r\nRichmond. DOCKETS here mean entries in a book giving lists of\r\nnames of persons connected with the cases tried, and particulars\r\nof the proceedings in each case. In justices' courts such dockets\r\nare made and kept by the justice himself.\r\n\r\nThe clerks of the courts mentioned have no salaries. They are paid\r\nby fees and special allowances. For example, when a clerk of court\r\nmakes out a writ or bond or a copy of any court document, he gets\r\na fee for doing it. (See under Secretary of the Commonwealth, page\r\n32.) A special allowance is an allowance (or a grant of money)\r\nmade by the court for special work done.\r\n\r\nThe TIPSTAFF and CRIER are executive officers of the Court of\r\nAppeals--that is, they execute or carry out certain orders of the\r\ncourt. In some places a sheriff's officer is called a tipstaff,\r\nthe name being derived from the custom of such officers bearing a\r\nSTAFF TIPPED with metal.\r\n\r\nCriers sometimes are appointed for other courts besides the Court\r\nof Appeals. The name is derived from the practice of proclaiming\r\nor CRYING out in court the commands or orders of the judge.\r\n\r\nSheriff.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff is the executive officer of the Circuit Court, and of\r\nthe Circuit and Chancery Courts of the city of Richmond; the City\r\nSergeant is the executive officer of the Corporation Courts and\r\nCircuit Courts held for cities, and the Hustings Court for the\r\ncity of Richmond; the Constable is the executive officer of the\r\nJustice's Court.\r\n\r\nThough the sheriff is an officer of the courts, he is more\r\nparticularly a county officer. His principal duties will,\r\ntherefore, be found set forth and explained under County Officers\r\n(see page 74). The city sergeant is also a court officer, but his\r\nduties are limited to cities. They are stated and explained under\r\nGovernment of Cities and Towns. The duties of the constable, who\r\nis a magisterial district officer, are explained under District\r\nOrganization.\r\n\r\nCommonwealth's Attorney.\r\n\r\nElected by the people at the general election in November for a\r\nterm of four years; must reside in the county or corporation for\r\nwhich he is elected; shall hold no other elective office. Salary,\r\nallowance by the Board of Supervisors and fees.\r\n\r\nDuties. Gives legal advice to the county and district officers,\r\nand prosecutes criminals in the Circuit and Corporation Courts.\r\n\r\nFor Board of Supervisors, see page 82.\r\n\r\nLEGAL ADVICE is advice on matters of law. The commonwealth's\r\nattorney prosecutes criminals--that is, he attends in court and\r\nmakes the charge, or states the case, and examines witnesses,\r\nagainst persons charged with crime.\r\n\r\nA WITNESS is a person who tells on oath, in answer to questions,\r\nwhat he knows about the crime charged against the accused, or\r\nabout the facts in a civil case or process. (See civil process and\r\nperjury, page 21.)\r\n\r\nAttorney-at-Law.\r\n\r\nMust hold license granted by any three or more judges of the\r\nSupreme Court of Appeals acting together under such rules and\r\nregulations and upon such examination both as to learning and\r\ncharacter as may be prescribed by the said Court; must be a male\r\ncitizen over the age of twenty-one years; must have resided in the\r\nState six months preceding application for a license; and must\r\nqualify before the Court in which he proposes to practice.\r\n\r\nAn ATTORNEY-AT-LAW is a person legally qualified and licensed to\r\nact as attorney. A person not a lawyer might be called an attorney\r\nif appointed to do any business on behalf of another, but to be an\r\nattorney-at law a person must be qualified as stated in the text.\r\n(See under Attorney-General, page 29.) A LICENSE is a permission\r\nto perform certain acts. It is usually in writing, and is issued\r\nby persons having legal authority to do so.\r\n\r\nAn attorney-at-law must QUALIFY before the court in which he\r\nwishes to practice. This means that he must produce evidence that\r\nhe is legally licensed, that he must take an oath that he will\r\nperform his duties as an attorney, and also that he must take an\r\noath that he will be faithful to the Commonwealth of Virginia.\r\n\r\nWho May Practice Law in Virginia.\r\n\r\nAny person duly authorized and practicing as Counsel or Attorney-\r\nat-Law in any State or Territory of the United\r\n\r\nStates, or in the District of Columbia; but if he resides in\r\nVirginia he must pay the prescribed license fee.\r\n\r\nDULY AUTHORIZED means having received the proper license, and\r\nhaving qualified. PRESCRIBED LICENSE FEE is a certain fee or\r\ncharge for the issuing of a license to practice in Virginia.\r\n\r\nJuries.\r\n\r\nDrawn by lot from a list of those well qualified to serve as\r\njurors, furnished by the Judge of the Circuit or Corporation\r\nCourts. The list shall contain not less than one hundred nor more\r\nthan three hundred names.\r\n\r\nAll male citizens over twenty-one years of age who have been\r\nresidents of the State for two years, and of the county, city, or\r\ntown in which they reside for one year next preceding their being\r\nsummoned to serve as such and competent in other respects, are\r\nWELL QUALIFIED to SERVE as jurors within the State. But certain\r\npersons are disqualified as not competent, such as idiots,\r\nlunatics, and persons convicted of bribery, perjury, embezzlement\r\nof public funds, treason, felony or petit larceny.\r\n\r\nCertain public officers and persons belonging to certain\r\nprofessions are exempt from jury service. The governor, the\r\nlieutenant-governor, postmasters, practicing physicians (doctors),\r\nand many others, are exempt from the duty of serving on juries.\r\n\r\nJuries in civil and misdemeanor cases are chosen by lot. Once\r\nevery year the judge of each circuit and corporation court makes\r\nout a list containing the names of not less than one hundred and\r\nnot more than three hundred persons resident in the county or\r\ncorporation and well qualified to serve as jurors. These names are\r\nwritten on slips of paper or ballots (each name on a separate\r\nballot) and the ballots, after being folded so that the names may\r\nnot be seen, are put into a box kept for the purpose by the clerk\r\nof the court.\r\n\r\nTen days before any term of a court at which a jury may be\r\nrequired, the clerk draws sixteen ballots from the box, without\r\nlooking at the names until they are all drawn out. The persons\r\nwhose names are thus drawn are summoned to attend at the term of\r\ncourt. Should more than sixteen be required, more are summoned,\r\nand on the day they attend the court their names are written on\r\nballots and placed in a box, and from them the juries for the\r\ntrial of cases are drawn in the manner already stated. This is\r\nwhat is called choosing or selecting BY LOT, the word lot meaning\r\nchance. It is considered the fairest way of forming a jury.\r\n\r\nIf jurors were appointed instead of being selected by lot, persons\r\nhaving prejudice or ill feeling against one of the parties in the\r\ncase might be put on the jury, and the verdict rendered by such\r\njury might be a very unjust one. But when the selection is by lot\r\nnobody knows who is to be on it, and so it is equally fair to both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons on a jury is usually twelve, but in a civil\r\ncase, if both parties consent, there may be a jury of only seven;\r\nor, the case may be tried and decided by a jury of three persons,\r\none selected by each of the two parties to the suit, and the third\r\nby the other two; or, by the judge without a jury.\r\n\r\nFor juries in cases of felony the names of twenty persons residing\r\nat a distance from the place where the crime or offence is said to\r\nhave been committed are taken from a list furnished by the circuit\r\nor the corporation court. Those twenty are summoned to attend the\r\ncourt, and from them a jury panel of sixteen is selected. The\r\naccused person may, without giving any reason, object to, or\r\nstrike off, any four of the sixteen, and the remaining twelve will\r\nbe the jury to try the case.\r\n\r\nIf the accused does not strike off any, or strikes off less than\r\nfour, a jury of twelve is selected from the panel by lot. The\r\nattorney for the commonwealth--that is, the attorney who\r\nprosecutes the accused--may CHALLENGE--that is, object to--a\r\njuror, but he must assign a reason for his objection, and if the\r\njudge decides in favor of his objection, the person challenged is\r\nnot put on the jury. A panel is a list of persons summoned to\r\nserve as jurors.\r\n\r\nTo SUMMON is to call or notify a person or persons to appear in\r\ncourt. A person who is summoned to attend as a juror and who,\r\nwithout sufficient reason, fails or neglects to do so, may be\r\npunished by a fine of not less than five nor more than twenty\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nPersons summoned as jurors are entitled to receive one dollar per\r\nday for service on a jury, and mileage at the rate of four cents\r\nper mile travelled in going to and returning from court. (Further\r\nexplanation as to the duties of juries will be found under Petit\r\nJury, page 71.)\r\n\r\nGrand Jury.\r\n\r\nConsists of not less than nine nor more than twelve persons taken\r\nfrom a list of forty-eight selected by the Judge of the Circuit or\r\nCorporation Court from the qualified jurors of the county or city\r\nin which his Court is held. A Special Grand Jury shall consist of\r\nnot less than six nor more than nine persons.\r\n\r\nThe principal duties of the GRAND JURY are mentioned under Circuit\r\nCourts, page 55. The law requires that \"the grand jury shall\r\ninquire of and present all felonies, misdemeanors, and violations\r\nof penal [criminal] laws committed within the jurisdiction of the\r\nrespective courts wherein they are sworn.\"\r\n\r\nTo PRESENT is to make a statement or PRESENTMENT to the court as\r\nexplained on page 55. Every grand jury has a chairman or speaker,\r\nwho is appointed by the court and is called the FOREMAN. The\r\nforeman is required to take an oath or swear that he will \"present\r\nno person through prejudice or ill-will, nor leave any unpresented\r\nthrough fear or favor,\" but that in all presentments he \"shall\r\npresent the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way the foreman is SWORN, and the other grand jurors must\r\nswear that they will \"observe and keep\" the same oath taken by the\r\nforeman. An oath is a solemn statement or declaration with an\r\nappeal to God, or calling God to witness that what is stated is\r\ntrue or that the person shall tell the truth.\r\n\r\nWitnesses before giving evidence in courts at the trial of a case\r\nmust make oath or swear to \"tell the truth, the whole truth and\r\nnothing but the truth.\" While the witness is repeating the words\r\nof the oath he holds a Bible or Testament in his hand, and kisses\r\nit when he has repeated the words.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of grand juries--regular and special. There is\r\na regular grand jury at two terms in each year, of the circuit,\r\ncorporation, or hustings court. But a grand jury may be ordered by\r\na circuit, corporation, or hustings court at any time there may be\r\nspecial or urgent need for it, and such grand jury is called a\r\nSPECIAL grand jury.\r\n\r\nGrand jurors are entitled to the same compensation and mileage as\r\npetit jurors (see next section).\r\n\r\nPetit Jury.\r\n\r\nConsists of twelve members.\r\n\r\nDuties. Hear evidence before the court in civil and criminal cases\r\nand render a verdict according to the law and evidence.\r\n\r\nThe PETIT JURY is the jury impanelled--that is, put on a panel or\r\nlist--to try cases in court. How such a jury is formed is stated\r\nunder Juries (see page 68). Petit jurors, like grand jurors, must\r\ntake an oath to do their duty honestly. (The word jury is derived\r\nfrom the Latin word jurare, which means to swear.)\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the petit jury to hear the evidence in the case\r\nit is to try, and to give a verdict in accordance with that\r\nevidence. If the evidence presented before the court proves the\r\naccused to be guilty, the jury must give a verdict of \"guilty\"; if\r\nthe evidence is not sufficient to show that he is guilty, they\r\nmust give a verdict of \"not guilty.\" (For verdict, see page 11.)\r\n\r\nThe verdict of the jury must also be ACCORDING TO LAW. This means\r\nthat the jury must give heed to the law of the case as explained\r\nby the judge. Evidence might be offered which would not be lawful.\r\nIt is the duty of the judge to decide whether evidence is lawful\r\nor not, and if he decides that any evidence is illegal or\r\nunlawful, then the jury must not pay any regard to it in\r\nconsidering their verdict.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

Convenience in administering justice and transacting\r\nlocal business.\r\n\r\nEach county shall maintain at the county seat a court-house,\r\nclerk's office, and jail.\r\n\r\nCounties are organized--that is, formed and invested with powers\r\nof government--by the General Assembly. The Assembly may form new\r\ncounties out of other counties or parts of other counties, but the\r\nConstitution of Virginia directs that \"no new county shall be\r\nformed with an area of less than six hundred square miles,\" and\r\nthat the county or counties from which a new one is formed shall\r\nnot be reduced below an area of six hundred square miles.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of having the State divided into counties may\r\neasily be seen. If there were no counties most of the people would\r\nhave to go long distances to the State capital in order to have\r\nimportant business attended to. County organization brings the\r\nadvantages of government and the administration of justice nearer\r\nthe homes of all the people.\r\n\r\nThe COUNTY SEAT is the chief town of the county, where the public\r\nbusiness of the county is chiefly transacted. The court-house is\r\nthe building in which judges sit for the trial of cases. The jail\r\nof the county is the prison in which persons convicted of minor\r\n(trifling) offences are detained for punishment, and in which\r\npersons charged with serious crimes are held in custody until\r\ntrial. Persons after trial and conviction for serious crimes are\r\nsent to the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThey are the executive officers under the authority of the laws of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nSheriff.\r\n\r\nElected by the people for four years. Salary, allowance by the\r\nBoard of Supervisors and fees.\r\n\r\nDuties. Appoints his deputies; makes arrests; serves notices;\r\ncollects fines; calls for troops in time of danger; executes any\r\norder, warrant, or process, lawfully directed to him, within his\r\nown county, or upon any bay, river, or creek adjoining thereto;\r\nlevies on property and sells to satisfy order of court; attends\r\nthe sittings of Circuit Courts; attends the meetings of the Board\r\nof Supervisors, and performs such duties as may be necessary for\r\nthe proper despatch of business; must not practice law in any\r\ncourt of which he is an officer; cannot hold any other elective\r\noffice; must give notice of violations of penal laws.\r\n\r\nThe salary or allowance for sheriffs is not the same in all\r\ncounties, but varies according to the number of the population. It\r\nis paid by the Board of Supervisors. (For Board of Supervisors,\r\nsee page 82.)\r\n\r\nThe sheriff may appoint deputies or assistants to help him in his\r\nduties, which are numerous and important. He is the principal\r\nexecutive officer of the county. It is his business to execute the\r\njudgments of the courts. If a person is sentenced to death, it is\r\nthe sheriff who must make and direct the arrangements for carrying\r\nout the sentence.\r\n\r\nA SENTENCE (in law) is the judgment, or declaration of punishment,\r\npronounced by a judge upon a criminal after being found guilty.\r\nThe sheriff must arrest and convey to prison any person or persons\r\nwho have committed crime. He must serve legal notices, such as\r\nnotices of decrees or judgments to be given against parties in\r\ncases of action for debt. He must collect fines that are not paid\r\nin court.\r\n\r\nAn important duty of the sheriff is to suppress riots or public\r\ndisturbances, and if he finds that he and his officers are unable\r\nto do so, he may call upon the governor for troops (soldiers) to\r\nassist him. In such case the governor may send State militia to\r\nsuppress the disturbance. The sheriff has charge or control of the\r\ncounty jail and the prisoners confined in it, and he must protect\r\nthe prison and prisoners against violence or attack by mobs.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff must carry out any order or warrant or process of the\r\ncourts. A PROCESS is a summons or notice requiring a person to\r\nappear in court on a certain day to answer a charge to be made\r\nagainst him. If a court gives judgment against a person for debt\r\nor fine or taxes not paid, the sheriff LEVIES on the property of\r\nthe person--that is, he takes or seizes it--and sells it to\r\nsatisfy or execute the order of court.\r\n\r\nIt is also the duty of the sheriff to give notice to the attorney\r\nfor the commonwealth of any crime (violation of penal laws) of\r\nwhich he may have knowledge. The sheriff cannot hold any other\r\nelective office--that is, an office to which a person is elected--\r\nand he cannot act as a lawyer in any court for which he does duty\r\nas sheriff.\r\n\r\nCommonwealth's Attorney.\r\n\r\nSee under Officers of Courts.\r\n\r\nCounty Clerk.\r\n\r\nAlso Clerk of the Circuit Court elected by the people for term of\r\neight years.\r\n\r\nDuties. See under Officers of Courts.\r\n\r\nA clerk of the county or a clerk of a court is an officer who does\r\nwriting of various kinds, such as keeping records of public\r\nbusiness, records of court proceedings, making out writs or bonds,\r\nor copies of court papers or documents. Many of the duties of\r\nclerks of counties and courts are mentioned in previous sections.\r\n\r\nTreasurer.\r\n\r\nElected by the people for four years. Salary, commissions.\r\n\r\nDuties. Shall receive the State revenues and the county (or city)\r\nlevies, and account for and pay over the same as provided by law;\r\nshall keep his office at the county seat; shall receive taxes from\r\nJuly 1st to December 1st; after that add five per cent. and\r\ncollect; shall settle with the Auditor of Public Accounts by\r\nDecember 15th, final settlement June 15th; may be required to make\r\nmonthly settlements; in cities of Richmond, Lynchburg, and\r\nPetersburg, shall make weekly settlements; may distrain for taxes;\r\nshall post delinquent list; must reside in the county; shall not\r\nhold any other elective office; shall not own any warrant against\r\nthe county or city; shall not lend out any public money, or use it\r\nfor any purpose other than such as is provided by law; shall\r\nreport violations of the revenue laws. Must reside in the county\r\nor city for which he is elected.\r\n\r\nThe STATE REVENUES are the taxes received for the State; the\r\nCOUNTY LEVIES are the taxes levied--that is, raised or collected--\r\nfor county purposes. These moneys the State treasurer must pay\r\nover as the law provides--that is, directs. The money collected\r\nfor the county he must pay out for various public purposes\r\nrelating to the county, but before making such payments he must\r\nhave a warrant (written authority to pay) from the Board of\r\nSupervisors. The money he receives for the State he must pay to\r\nthe auditor of public accounts.\r\n\r\nThe time for the receiving of taxes is from July 1st to December\r\n1st each year. An addition of five per cent. is made to taxes not\r\npaid by the latter date. The treasurer must SETTLE with the\r\nauditor by December 15th--that is, he must by that time have paid\r\nover to him all moneys received for the State. By June 15th he\r\nmust make a final settlement This means that he must settle for\r\nall taxes paid to him since December 15th, and furnish lists of\r\nthose who have failed to pay. Besides county treasurers there are\r\ncity treasurers. (See also under Government of Cities and Towns)\r\n\r\nIf any person fail or refuse to pay taxes assessed upon him, the\r\ntreasurer may DISTRAIN his property to recover the amount. To\r\ndistrain is to seize property for debt due. (To ASSESS is to fix\r\nor name a certain amount as a tax on property, or to value\r\nproperty with the object of fixing a tax upon it) A person who\r\nfails or neglects or refuses to pay his taxes is called a\r\nDELINQUENT, a word that means one who fails to perform his duty.\r\n\r\nA DELINQUENT LIST is a list or paper containing the names of\r\npersons who have failed to pay the taxes, and a notice that at a\r\ncertain time certain property of such persons will be sold if the\r\ntaxes are not previously paid. A copy of the delinquent list must\r\nbe posted at public places within the city or county in which the\r\nproperty to be sold is situated. A county treasurer is not himself\r\nallowed to purchase or own any warrant or claim against the county\r\ntreasury. (A warrant here means an order for the payment of\r\nmoney.)\r\n\r\nThe REVENUE LAWS are the laws relating to assessing, payment, and\r\ncollection of taxes. To conceal property so as to escape\r\nassessment of taxes, or to carry on certain kinds of business\r\nwithout paying the license or tax on such business, would be to\r\nviolate the revenue laws. The treasurer must report all violations\r\nof the revenue laws of which he may have knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe salary of the treasurer is paid by commissions--that is,\r\nallowances--by way of percentages on the amounts he receives. The\r\ncommission varies from two per cent, (two dollars for every\r\nhundred dollars) on large amounts, to three and five per cent, on\r\nsmall receipts.\r\n\r\nCommissioner of the Revenue.\r\n\r\nElected by the people for four years; must reside in the district\r\nfor which he is elected. Salary, commissions and fees.\r\n\r\nDuties. Shall ascertain and assess, when not otherwise assessed,\r\nall the property, real and personal, not exempt from taxation, in\r\nhis county, district, or city, and the person to whom the same is\r\nchargeable with taxes, all subjects of taxation, and also all male\r\npersons of full age and sound mind residing therein; shall issue\r\nlicenses; register births and deaths; and report violations of the\r\nrevenue and penal laws.\r\n\r\nTo ASCERTAIN all the property, real and personal, and the person\r\nto whom it is chargeable with taxes, is to find out where and what\r\nthe property is and who is the owner, so that the proper tax may\r\nbe assessed and charged against him. (For meaning of REAL and\r\nPERSONAL property, see under Circuit Courts, page 50.)\r\n\r\nSUBJECTS OF TAXATION means property on which taxes may be charged\r\nor assessed. Certain kinds of property are exempt--that is, free--\r\nfrom taxation in Virginia. All real estate or buildings owned by\r\nreligious bodies and used as churches for divine worship are\r\nexempt from taxation. Public burying-grounds (cemeteries), real\r\nestate belonging to counties, cities, or towns, real estate\r\nbelonging to the University of Virginia and other institutions\r\ndevoted to purposes of education, real estate belonging to various\r\nbenevolent institutions, such as lunatic asylums and orphan\r\nasylums, and in general all real estate devoted to religious,\r\ncharitable, or educational uses, and not for profit to private\r\nindividuals, are exempt from taxation.\r\n\r\nA LICENSE is a permission or authority to carry on certain kinds\r\nof business or certain professions. Attorneys-at-law, doctors,\r\ndentists, and persons who manufacture or sell liquors, owners of\r\ntheaters, and public shows, and people who engage in many other\r\nsorts of business must have licenses.\r\n\r\nThe licenses are issued or given out by commissioners of the\r\nrevenue, and a certain sum must be paid for each, the money\r\nreceived being part of the public income or revenue for paying the\r\nexpenses of government. Licenses are granted for a certain time.\r\nMany are granted for a year, and some for only a number of months\r\nor weeks or days. When the time specified in the license (which is\r\na written or printed paper) expires, a new license must be\r\nobtained and another payment made.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the commissioner of the revenue to register\r\n(record) the births and deaths in his district. At the time that\r\nhe ascertains the personal property in his district which is to be\r\ntaxed, he must ascertain the births and deaths that have occurred\r\nduring the past year, and enter or write the particulars in books\r\nkept by him for the purpose. He must write the name and date of\r\nbirth of every child, and the name, address, and occupation of the\r\nfather; and he must enter the name and place of birth, and the\r\nnames of the parents, of any person who has died.\r\n\r\nIt is also the duty of the commissioner of revenue to report to\r\nthe commonwealth's attorney any violation of the revenue or penal\r\nlaws of which he may have knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe number of commissioners of revenue is not the same in all the\r\ncounties. A great many of the counties have four each, and some\r\nhave less. In counties having more than one, each commissioner has\r\na district for himself.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of the Poor.\r\n\r\nAppointed by the Circuit Judge, on the recommendation of the Board\r\nof Supervisors, for a term of four years; must reside in the\r\ncounty or city for which he is elected. Salary, not to exceed\r\n$400.\r\n\r\nDuties. Shall have charge of the Poor-house, receive and care for\r\nthe paupers sent to him by the Overseers of the Poor; receive and\r\ndisburse, under the direction of the Board of Supervisors, the\r\npoor levy; make an annual report to the Board of Supervisors.\r\n\r\nIn every county there is a POOR-HOUSE, usually having a farm\r\nannexed, and in it paupers are received and cared for at the\r\npublic expense. A. PAUPER is a poor person who has no means of\r\nliving and is supported in a public or charitable institution.\r\n(For OVERSEER OF THE POOR, see under District Organization.)\r\n\r\nThe POOR LEVY is the tax annually levied for the support of the\r\npoor-house. This levy is made by the Board of Supervisors (which\r\nsee), and the amount collected is received and DISBURSED--that is,\r\nexpended--by the superintendent of the poor for the purpose for\r\nwhich it is intended.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent must make a report annually to the Board of\r\nSupervisors. This means that he must make a statement for the\r\nboard once every year, showing the number of paupers provided for\r\nduring the year, giving the name of each and how long supported,\r\nand also showing the total amount of money expended, the work done\r\non the farm, the crops raised, and other information and\r\nparticulars relating to the management of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe salary of superintendents of the poor is not the same in all\r\ncounties. It varies according to the population.\r\n\r\nCounty Surveyor.\r\n\r\nAppointed by the Circuit Court, on the recommendation of the Board\r\nof Supervisors, for four years; must reside in the county for\r\nwhich he is appointed. Salary, fees and mileage.\r\n\r\nDuties. Shall promptly make surveys of land ordered by courts, and\r\nreturn true plat and certificate thereof; establish meridian line;\r\nlocate land warrants.\r\n\r\nA SURVEYOR is one who measures portions of land to ascertain their\r\narea, or who ascertains or fixes the boundaries, form, extent and\r\nposition of any district or territory.\r\n\r\nThe COUNTY SURVEYOR must survey lands when ordered by the court,\r\nand make out and certify a TRUE PLAT of such lands. A PLAT is a\r\nplan or map or chart.\r\n\r\nA MERIDIAN LINE, as meant in the text, is a line located at some\r\ncentral and easily reached place in the county, running due north\r\nand south for not less than three hundred yards, and marked at\r\neach end of the three hundred yards upon a solid stone fixed in\r\nthe earth. This line is necessary for various purposes of\r\nsurveying and map making. There must be a meridian line marked in\r\nevery county, and when a new county is formed it is the duty of\r\nthe surveyor to establish a meridian line.\r\n\r\nTO LOCATE LAND WARRANTS is to lay off (mark out) and survey\r\nportions of waste land belonging to the State for persons who have\r\npurchased any of such land. The warrants or orders for the land\r\nare issued by the register of the land office on receipt of the\r\npurchase money (see page 37).\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Public Schools. See Education.\r\n\r\nCounty Board of School Commissioners.\r\n\r\nSee Education.\r\n\r\nElectoral Board. Appointed by the Circuit or Corporation Court for\r\nterm of three years; composed of three qualified voters, residents\r\nof the county or city. Salary, $2 for each day of actual service,\r\nnot to exceed $10 a year.\r\n\r\nDuties.

As the\r\nduties of the board may be performed in a few days each year, the\r\ntotal salary for each member is limited to $10 a year.\r\n\r\nAN ELECTION DISTRICT is constituted (made up) of a magisterial\r\ndistrict in a county, and a WARD in a city. For the former, see\r\nMAGISTERIAL DISTRICTS. For WARD, see under GOVERNMENT OF CITIES\r\nAND TOWNS.\r\n\r\nA REGISTRAR is an officer who registers or enters in books kept\r\nfor the purpose the names of all persons in his district who are\r\nentitled to vote. He must be at his voting place on the second\r\nTuesday in each year to register all qualified voters who shall\r\napply to be registered, and ten days previous to the November\r\nelections he must sit one day to amend, and correct the list where\r\nnecessary, and to register qualified voters not previously\r\nregistered.\r\n\r\nJUDGES OF ELECTION have already been mentioned and some of their\r\nduties explained. (See page 14, also under Secretary of the\r\nCommonwealth, page 32, and under Board of State Canvassers, page\r\n43, for manner of receiving and dealing with election returns)\r\n\r\nBoard of Supervisors.\r\n\r\nComposed of the Supervisors of the several magisterial districts\r\nof the county. Salary, $3 per day and mileage. The County Clerk is\r\nthe clerk of the Board.\r\n\r\nDuties.

All such statements must\r\nbe audited by the Board of Supervisors. An EXHIBIT is a paper\r\nshowing or proving the correctness of money accounts, such as a\r\nvoucher or a receipt. A CAPITATION tax is a tax on persons (from\r\nLatin caput, the head). A capitation tax is levied on all male\r\npersons over the age of twenty-one. The Board of Supervisors\r\nrepresents the county in all public matters, as in any action at\r\nlaw taken for or against the county, and it has the care and\r\ncontrol generally of the public property, and the direction of the\r\npublic business affairs of the county.\r\n\r\nAssessors.\r\n\r\nAppointed for a term of four years; number same as the number of\r\nCommissioners of the Revenue; must be a resident of the district\r\nfor which he is appointed. Salary, $2 for each day he is\r\nnecessarily employed.\r\n\r\nDuties. Examine, immediately after appointment, all the lands and\r\nlots, with the improvements thereon, within their respective\r\ncounties, districts, and corporations, and ascertain and assess\r\nthe cash value thereof.\r\n\r\nThe land within the districts is valued by the assessors with the\r\nobject of fixing upon each property the tax to be levied. When the\r\nassessor of a district has completed his valuations and made a\r\nrecord of them, he must send a copy of the record to the auditor\r\nof public accounts, another to the commissioner of revenue for the\r\ndistrict, and another must be filed and preserved in the office of\r\nthe county clerk.\r\n\r\nCoroner.\r\n\r\nAppointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the Circuit\r\nCourt. A Justice of the Peace may act as Coroner. Salary, fees.\r\n\r\nDuties. To hold inquest over the dead bodies of those supposed to\r\nhave been killed by violence; may act as sheriff in certain cases.\r\n\r\nEvery county must have at least one CORONER, but a county may have\r\nmore than one, if the circuit court thinks it necessary. In such\r\ncase the court recommends the appointment of a second coroner and\r\nnominates two persons for the office. The governor appoints one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe business of the CORONER is to hold an INQUEST or inquiry into\r\nevery case of death supposed to have been caused by violence. The\r\ncoroner's inquest is conducted much after the manner of a jury\r\ntrial. There is a jury of six persons, summoned by the sheriff or\r\nsergeant or constable, and sworn \"to diligently inquire, and true\r\npresentment make, when, how, and by what means the person came by\r\nhis death.\"\r\n\r\nAfter witnesses have been examined and the whole case has been\r\nthoroughly investigated, the jury gives its verdict. If the jury\r\nshould find that murder or assault was committed on the deceased,\r\nand should charge any person with the crime, the coroner issues\r\nhis warrant for the arrest of the person, and if found he is\r\narrested and held in prison until he is tried by a judge and jury.\r\n\r\n QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n 1.

A member of the Board of Supervisors; shall inspect the\r\nroads and bridges in his district.\r\n\r\nThe general duties of the Board of Supervisors have been already\r\nexplained, but each supervisor has special duties in his own\r\ndistrict. He must inspect the public roads and bridges in his\r\ndistrict twice every year to see that they are kept in repair, and\r\nhe must once a year make a written report to the Board of\r\nSupervisors as to their condition.\r\n\r\nFor the time he is actually employed in such service each\r\nsupervisor receives two dollars a day, paid out of the public\r\nfunds of his own district, but he is not allowed for such service\r\nmore than thirty dollars in any one year.\r\n\r\nJustices of the Peace.\r\n\r\nThree in each district; elected by the people for four years; must\r\nreside in the district. Salary, fees.\r\n\r\nDuties. Is a conservator of the peace; must see that the laws are\r\nobeyed; may issue warrants, attachments, etc.; may hold court for\r\nthe trial of causes. (See Justices' Courts.)\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of justices is fully explained under JUSTICES'\r\nCOURTS. Justices of the peace receive no salaries, but they are\r\nallowed fees for the issuing and certifying of several kinds of\r\nlegal documents.\r\n\r\nA CONSERVATOR of the peace is a preserver of the peace. To\r\npreserve the peace is one of the chief duties of a justice of the\r\npeace, hence the title of his office. If he have good reason to\r\nbelieve that any person intends to commit an offence against\r\nanother, it is the duty of a justice to issue a warrant for the\r\narrest of such person, and to require him to give bail or security\r\nfor his good behavior.\r\n\r\nIn general it is the duty of the justice of the peace to do\r\neverything necessary to prevent, as well as to punish, violations\r\nof the criminal law in his district.\r\n\r\nAn ATTACHMENT is a writ directing an officer of the law to arrest\r\nand bring into court a person who has been summoned to attend as a\r\nwitness or a juror, but has failed to appear at the proper time.\r\n\r\nConstable.\r\n\r\nElected by the people for four years; must reside in the district.\r\nSalary, fees.\r\n\r\nDuties. To make arrests; to serve notices; to execute any order,\r\nwarrant, or process, legally directed to him; attend Justices'\r\nCourts; execute its judgments, levy attachments, collect fines,\r\nreport violations of the penal laws; may act as sheriff in certain\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe constable performs in his district the same sort of duties\r\ngenerally that the sheriff performs for the county.\r\n\r\nOverseer of the Poor.\r\n\r\nElected by the people for four years; must reside in the district.\r\nSalary, $2 for each day actually engaged, but not to exceed $20\r\nper year.\r\n\r\nDuties.

Paupers not\r\nhaving a legal settlement may be removed to the place where they\r\nwere last legally settled, but a warrant of removal must be\r\nobtained from a justice of the county or district.\r\n\r\nA MINOR is a boy or girl under twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nConservators of the Peace.\r\n\r\nEvery judge throughout the State; every justice, commissioner in\r\nchancery, and notary within his county or corporation; conductors\r\nof railroad trains on their trains; depot agents at their places\r\nof business; masters of all steamers navigating the waters of the\r\nState on their respective vessels.\r\n\r\nA NOTARY, or notary public, is an officer who attests or certifies\r\ndeeds and other papers, under his official seal. Statements in\r\nwriting that require to be attested for business or legal purposes\r\nare usually taken to a notary to be signed by him after the party\r\nhas made oath that the statements are true.\r\n\r\nConductors of railroad trains may arrest any persons who violate\r\nthe peace on their trains, and keep such persons in custody until\r\nthey can be given over to the proper authorities for trial.\r\nRailroad depot agents may do the same at their depots, and the\r\nmasters or captains of steamers may do the same on their vessels\r\nwhile sailing in the waters within the State. This is what is\r\nmeant by being CONSERVATORS of the peace. Judges have the same\r\npower throughout the State, and justices, commissioners in\r\nchancery, and notaries within their districts.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\nEach magisterial district is also a school district, for which see\r\nunder Education, page 99.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL TRUSTEES.\r\n\r\nOne school trustee is appointed annually for each school district;\r\nsee page 99.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT BOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES.\r\n\r\nThis board is composed of three trustees of the district; for its\r\nduties, see page 99.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

What provisions with regard to schools are mentioned as being\r\nmade in the magisterial districts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF CITIES AND TOWNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA City is an incorporated community containing within well-defined\r\nboundaries five thousand or more inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA Town is an incorporated community of less than five thousand\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nA Council includes any body or bodies authorized to make\r\nordinances for the government of a city or town.\r\n\r\nAn incorporated town or city is a community chartered as a\r\ncorporation, for explanation of which, see page 14.\r\n\r\nOrdinances are laws made by the council of a city or town for\r\nmanaging the public affairs of the city, or town.\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL.\r\n\r\nIn towns it is composed of the Mayor and six Councilmen, elected\r\nevery two years by the people of the town on the second Tuesday in\r\nJune. The Mayor and each Councilman have the power and authority\r\nof a justice in civil matters within the corporate limits, and in\r\ncriminal matters within these limits and one mile beyond them; may\r\nissue processes, and may hear and determine prosecutions, etc. In\r\ncities the Councilmen of each ward are elected by the people of\r\nsuch ward. The Council of cities of over ten thousand inhabitants\r\nis made up of two branches:--the Board of Aldermen and the Common\r\nCouncil, all of whom are elected for four years, one-half being\r\nchosen every two years. These provisions may be modified by the\r\ncity charter. Members of Common Council shall hold no other office\r\nin cities; no city officer shall hold a seat in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nIt is the aim of the Constitution that, so far as possible, all\r\ncities shall be organized under general laws.\r\n\r\nA city charter is the law under which the city is governed. It is\r\npassed by the General Assembly, and it makes the city a\r\ncorporation. It states what powers the corporation may exercise\r\nand what officers it may appoint or elect to carry on its\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nA charter is for a city what a constitution is for a State. It\r\nprescribes the system under which the city is to be governed.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the mayor and the councilmen as justices are\r\nmodified--that is, regulated--by the city charter, so that they\r\nmay not be exactly the same in all cities.\r\n\r\nCities are divided into districts called wards, and each ward\r\nelects a certain number of councilmen.\r\n\r\nPOWERS.

These eight\r\nconstitute the State Board of Education, and their several powers\r\nand duties as members of the Board are identical except that the\r\ntwo division superintendents shall not participate in the\r\nappointment of any public school official.\r\n\r\nThis Board shall have the management and investment of school\r\nfunds; make by-laws for its own government, and for carrying into\r\neffect the school laws; audit claims payable out of State funds;\r\narrange for summer normal schools of teachers for instruction in\r\nprocesses of school organization, discipline, and management;\r\nselect text-books and educational appliances for use in the public\r\nschools of the State; appoint (and remove), subject to\r\nconfirmation by the Senate, all county and city superintendents,\r\nand regulate all matters arising in the practical administration\r\nof the school system not otherwise provided for.\r\n\r\nThe three State officers are ex officio members of the Board. The\r\nthree experienced educators are elected quadrennially by the\r\nSenate from a list of eligibles consisting of one from each of the\r\nfaculties and nominated by the respective boards of visitors or\r\ntrustees of the University of Virginia, the Virginia Military\r\nInstitute, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the State Female\r\nNormal School at Danville, the School for the Deaf and Blind, and\r\nalso of the College of William and Mary so long as the State\r\ncontinues its annual appropriation to the last-named institution.\r\nThe city and county superintendents are selected by the other six\r\nmembers for terms of two years each.\r\n\r\nSchool funds are moneys set apart or provided for the support of\r\nschools. In Virginia, school funds are provided by the State, the\r\ncounties, and the districts (see under School Funds).\r\n\r\nBy-laws are laws or rules made by any association for the\r\nmanagement of its affairs. The Board of Education makes by-laws\r\nfor its own government and for administering the laws relating to\r\nthe schools.\r\n\r\nClaims payable out of State funds are claims which by law are to\r\nbe paid out of the State funds. Such claims must be audited by the\r\nBoard of Education. The salaries and expenses of State education\r\nofficers are paid out of the State fund, and portions of the fund\r\nare divided among the counties and cities for the support of\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nBy arranging for meetings of teachers for instruction in the\r\nprocesses of school organization, discipline, and instruction, the\r\nState Board of Education does much to improve the schools of the\r\nState, and the great yearly institutes are of the highest value to\r\nthe schools.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important duties of the State Board is in\r\nconnection with the selection of text-books and the approval of\r\neducational appliances for the equipment of schools.\r\n\r\nThe general duties of the State Board of Education consist in\r\nregulating all matters arising in the practical administration of\r\nthe school system not otherwise provided for. Uniformity of\r\npractice throughout the schools of the State is of the greatest\r\nimportance, and the State Board wisely secures this by keeping in\r\nconstant correspondence with officers and teachers throughout the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Education chooses its own secretary, who is\r\nentrusted with many important duties in carrying out the plans and\r\nwork of the board.\r\n\r\nAs all division superintendents are appointees of the State Board,\r\nit is provided in the Constitution that the two who are members of\r\nthe State Board shall not participate in the election of school\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nSUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nElected by the people of the State for four years; salary, $2,000,\r\nand necessary traveling expenses; shall have his office at the\r\ncapital; shall be the chief executive of the public free school\r\nsystem; shall determine the true intent and meaning of the school\r\nlaws; shall receive reports from school officers; inspect schools,\r\nand decide appeals from the decisions of county superintendents;\r\napportion State funds among the counties and cities of the State.\r\n\r\nThe public free school system is the system under which, as\r\nrequired by the law of Virginia, the public schools are free to\r\nall persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years residing\r\nwithin the school districts.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of public instruction is the chief executive\r\nofficer of the system, and when any dispute arises among school\r\nofficers as to the meaning or application of school laws, it is\r\nhis duty to determine--that is, to decide--it.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of public instruction is also to a large extent\r\na judicial officer, and his decisions as to the true intent and\r\nmeaning of the school laws have very nearly as much force as the\r\ndecisions of the courts.\r\n\r\nThe reports received from school officers by the State\r\nsuperintendent are embodied in his report made every two years to\r\nthe governor, and by him transmitted to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis report, in addition to the information received from the\r\ncounty and city superintendents, contains a large amount of\r\nstatistics and reports in regard to private schools, colleges, and\r\nother institutions which are more or less under the care and\r\nsubject to the control of the State.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY.--COUNTY AND CITY SUPERINTENDENTS.\r\n\r\nTerm, four years, beginning July 1st after appointment; must\r\nreside in the county or city for which he is elected, and shall\r\nhold no elective office; shall explain the school system, examine\r\nteachers and grant certificates, promote the improvement and\r\nefficiency of teachers, advise with and counsel trustees and\r\nteachers, visit and examine schools under his care and inquire\r\ninto whatever concerns their usefulness and perfection; decide\r\nappeals and complaints; administer oaths and take testimony;\r\napportion the school funds among the districts.\r\n\r\nThe county and city superintendents must hold examinations at\r\ncertain times in their counties or cities to examine persons\r\ndesiring to become teachers, and if, after examination, such\r\npersons are found qualified, they receive certificates as\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nIn any case of appeal or complaint against any person connected\r\nwith the schools in their districts the county or city\r\nsuperintendents must hold inquiry into the matter and give\r\ndecision upon it. In making such inquiry they can call witnesses\r\nand administer oaths to such witnesses before taking their\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nIt is also the duty of the superintendents to prepare annually a\r\nscheme or plan for apportioning the State and county school funds\r\namong the school districts under their supervision.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL TRUSTEE ELECTORAL BOARD.\r\n\r\nComposed of the County Superintendent of Schools, the\r\nCommonwealth's Attorney, and a resident qualified voter, not a\r\ncounty or state officer, to be appointed by the Judge of the\r\nCircuit Court; shall fill all vacancies in the district boards of\r\nschool trustees. In cities and towns school trustees are appointed\r\nby municipal councils.\r\n\r\nA vacancy occurs every year in each district board. The district\r\nboard when first formed was composed of three members, one to\r\nserve three years, one to serve two years, and the other to serve\r\none year, all appointments afterwards to be for three years each.\r\nThus there is one vacancy every year in the board, and it is the\r\nduty of the School Trustee Electoral Board to appoint a new\r\ntrustee to fill the vacancy.\r\n\r\nCounty School Board.\r\n\r\nComposed of the County Superintendent (who is ex officio\r\npresident) and the District School Trustees of the county--\"a body\r\ncorporate\"; shall make necessary bylaws and regulations, shall\r\nhave a regular annual meeting between the 1st and 15th of August;\r\nshall prepare and file with the Superintendent before July 15th an\r\nestimate of the amount of money that will be needed for public\r\nschool purposes in the county for the next year, also a similar\r\nlist for each school district based on the estimate of the\r\nDistrict Board, which lists the Superintendent shall lay before\r\nthe Board of Supervisors; shall make settlement with treasurers\r\nand school officers; shall administer certain properties devoted\r\nto school purposes.\r\n\r\nEx officio is a Latin phrase meaning by virtue of office. The\r\ncounty superintendent is president of the County School Board, not\r\nby election or appointment, but because of his office as county\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\nA body corporate is a corporation, the meaning of which term is\r\nexplained on page 14.\r\n\r\nProperty of any kind, either public funds or donations from\r\nprivate persons, set apart or devoted to school purposes in the\r\ncounty is administered by the County School Board--that is,\r\nmanaged and used by the board for the support of schools in the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nDistrict.--School Districts.\r\n\r\nEach county shall be divided into compactly located school\r\ndistricts, which shall correspond with the magisterial districts,\r\nunless specially subdivided; except that a town of five hundred or\r\nmore inhabitants may form a separate school district.\r\n\r\nSchool Trustees.\r\n\r\nOne shall be appointed annually for each district for a term of\r\nthree years; must be able to read and write.\r\n\r\nSchool trustees are appointed annually by the School Trustee\r\nElectoral Board, as explained above.\r\n\r\nDistrict Board of School Trustees.\r\n\r\n\"A body corporate\"--composed of the three trustees of the\r\ndistrict; shall hold and manage the school property of the\r\ndistrict; provide suitable school houses, etc.; enforce school\r\nlaws; employ and dismiss teachers; suspend and dismiss pupils; see\r\nthat census of children of school age (5 to 21) is taken every\r\nfive years; submit to the County School Board annually an estimate\r\nof the amount of money needed for public school purposes in the\r\ndistrict for the next scholastic year.\r\n\r\nIn cities the Board is composed of all the trustees in the city,\r\nand its duties and powers are modified and enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe census of children is the numbering or counting of the\r\nchildren residing in the district.\r\n\r\nThe scholastic year is the part of the year during which the\r\nschools are open.\r\n\r\nThe District Board of School Trustees has the whole care and\r\nadministration of the schools in its charge, and is thus the most\r\nimportant local body in the civil government of the State.\r\n\r\nSchool Funds.\r\n\r\n1. State Funds. The interest on the literary fund, the capitation\r\ntax, and a tax on property of one mill on the dollar.\r\n\r\n2. County Funds. Such tax as the Board of Supervisors may levy for\r\ncounty school purposes; fines and penalties imposed on the\r\nSuperintendent; donations, or the income arising therefrom.\r\n\r\n3. District Funds. Such tax as the Board of Supervisors may levy\r\nfor the purposes of the school district; fines and penalties\r\nimposed on district school officers and teachers; donations, or\r\nincome arising therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe County or City Treasurer receives and pays out all school\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nFor explanation of literary fund, see page 37, and for capitation\r\ntax, see page 82. The tax of one mill on the dollar means a tax of\r\none mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation of the property.\r\n\r\nCertain fines and other money penalties may be imposed by the\r\nBoard of Education or by the courts or county superintendents for\r\nfailing or refusing to perform certain duties Such fines and\r\npenalties are added to the school fund for the county\r\n\r\nWhen district school officers or teachers are fined for neglect of\r\nduty the money goes to the district fund. Donations are\r\ncontributions or gifts from private individuals. If such gifts are\r\nreal estate, the income arising therefrom is the rent of such real\r\nestate or the interest on the amount realized by its sale.\r\n\r\nTeachers.\r\n\r\nMust hold a certificate of qualification in full force, issued or\r\napproved by the Superintendent of Schools of the county or city\r\nwithin which he proposes to teach.\r\n\r\nThe law requires that a teacher must be at least eighteen years of\r\nage. If the teacher has the necessary education to pass the\r\nrequired examination, a certain maturity is necessary to insure\r\ngood judgment in the government and discipline of the school.\r\n\r\nThe value and success of all government depend largely upon the\r\ncharacter and ability of those in authority, and this is\r\nespecially true in the government of the school.\r\n\r\nFor teachers' certificates of qualification, see above under\r\nCounty and City Superintendents.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

That all men are by nature equally free and\r\nindependent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they\r\nenter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact,\r\ndeprive or divest their posterity, namely, the enjoyment of life\r\nand liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property,\r\nand pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. That all power is vested in, and consequently derived\r\nfrom, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and\r\nservants, and at all times amenable to them.\r\n\r\nSEC. 3. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the\r\ncommon benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or\r\ncommunity; of all the various modes and forms of government, that\r\nis best, which is capable of producing the greatest degree of\r\nhappiness and safety, and is most effectually secured against the\r\ndanger of maladministration; and, whenever any government shall be\r\nfound inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the\r\ncommunity hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right\r\nto reform, alter or abolsh it, in such manner as shall be judged\r\nmost conducive to the public weal.\r\n\r\nSEC. 4. That no man, or set of men, is entitled to exclusive or\r\nseparate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in\r\nconsideration of public services, which not being descendible,\r\nneither ought the offices of magistrate, legislator or judge to be\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\nSEC 5 That the legislative executive, and judicial departments of\r\nthe State should be separate and distinct, and that the members\r\nthereof may be restrained from oppression, by feeling and\r\nparticipating the burthens of the people, they should, at fixed\r\nperiods, be reduced to a private station, return into that body\r\nfrom which they were originally taken, and the vacancies be\r\nsupplied by regular elections, in which all or any part of the\r\nformer members shall be again eligible, or ineligible, as the laws\r\nmay direct\r\n\r\nSEC 6 That all elections should be free, and that all men, having\r\nsufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and\r\nattachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage, and can\r\nnot be taxed, or deprived of, or damaged in, their property for\r\npublic uses without their own consent, or that of their\r\nrepresentatives duly elected, or bound by any law to which they\r\nhave not, in like manner, assented for the public good\r\n\r\nSEC 7 That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws,\r\nby any authority, without consent of the representatives of the\r\npeople, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be\r\nexercised\r\n\r\nSEC 8 That no man shall be deprived of his life, or liberty,\r\nexcept by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers, nor\r\nshall any man be compelled in any criminal proceeding to give\r\nevidence against himself, nor be put twice in jeopardy for the\r\nsame offence, but an appeal may be allowed to the Commonwealth in\r\nall prosecutions for the violation of a law relating to the state\r\nrevenue\r\n\r\nThat in all criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the\r\ncause and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the\r\naccusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and to\r\na speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whose\r\nunanimous consent he cannot be found guilty, provided, however,\r\nthat in any criminal case, upon a plea of guilty, tendered in\r\nperson by the accused, and with the consent of the attorney for\r\nthe Commonwealth, entered of record, the court shall, and in a\r\nprosecution for an offence not punishable by death, or confinement\r\nin the penitentiary, upon a plea of not guilty, with the consent\r\nof the accused, given in person and of the attorney for the\r\nCommonwealth, both entered of record, the court, in its\r\ndiscretion, may hear and determine the case, without the\r\nintervention of a jury, and, that the General Assembly may provide\r\nfor the trial of offences not punishable by death, or confinement\r\nin the penitentiary, by a justice of the peace, without a jury,\r\npreserving in all such cases, the right of the accused to an\r\nappeal to and trial by jury in the circuit or corporation court,\r\nand may also provide for juries consisting of less than twelve,\r\nbut not less than five, for the trial of offences not punishable\r\nby death, or confinement in the penitentiary, and may classify\r\nsuch cases, and prescribe the number of jurors for each class\r\n\r\nSEC 9 That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive\r\nfines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\r\n\r\nSEC 10 That general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may\r\nbe commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact\r\ncommitted, or to seize any person or persons not named or whose\r\noffence is not particularly described and supported by evidence,\r\nare grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be granted\r\n\r\nSEC 11 That no person shall be deprived of his property without\r\ndue process of law, and in controversies respecting property, and\r\nin suits between man and man, trial by jury is preferable to any\r\nother and ought to be held sacred, but the General Assembly may\r\nlimit the number of jurors for civil cases in circuit and\r\ncorporation courts to not less than five in cases now cognizable\r\nby justices of the peace, or to not less than seven in cases not\r\nso cognizable\r\n\r\nSEC 12 That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks\r\nof liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic\r\ngovernments, and any citizen may freely speak, write and publish\r\nhis sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of\r\nthat right\r\n\r\nSEC 13 That a well regulated milita, composed of the body of the\r\npeople, trained to arms, is the proper, natural and safe defence\r\nof a free state, that standing armies, in time of peace, should be\r\navoided as dangerous to liberty, and that in all cases the\r\nmilitary should be under strict subordination to, and governed by,\r\nthe civil power\r\n\r\nSEC 14 That the people have a right to uniform government, and,\r\ntherefore, that no government separate from, or independent of,\r\nthe government of Virginia, ought to be erected or established\r\nwithin the limits therof\r\n\r\nSEC 15 That no free government, or the blessing of liberty, can be\r\npreserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice,\r\nmoderation, temperance, frugality and virtue, and by frequent\r\nrecurrence to fundamental principles\r\n\r\nSEC 16 That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and\r\nthe manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and\r\nconviction, not by force or violence, and, therefore, all men are\r\nequally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to\r\nthe dictates of conscience, and that it is the mutual duty of all\r\nto practice Christian forbearance, love and charity towards each\r\nother\r\n\r\nSEC 17 The rights enumerated in this Bill of Rights shall not be\r\nconstrued to limit other rights of the people not therein\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE II\r\n\r\nELECTIVE FRANCHISE AND QUALIFICATIONS

In each city of the first class, there shall be, in\r\naddition to the circuit court, a corporation court. In any city\r\ncontaining thirty thousand inhabitants or more, the General\r\nAssembly may provide for such additional courts as the public\r\ninterest may require, and in every such city the city courts, as\r\nthey now exist, shall continue until otherwise provided by law. In\r\nevery city of the second class, the corporation or hustings court\r\nexisting, at the time this Constitution goes into effect, shall\r\ncontinue hereafter under the name of the corporation court of such\r\ncity, but it may be abolished by a vote of a majority of the\r\nqualified electors of such city, at an election held for the\r\npurpose, and whenever the office of judge of a corporation or\r\nhustings court of a city of the second class, whose salary is less\r\nthan eight hundred dollars, shall become and remain vacant for\r\nninety days consecutively, such court shall thereby cease to\r\nexist. In case of the abolition of the corporation or hustings\r\ncourt of any city of the second class, such city shall thereupon\r\ncome in every respect within the jurisdiction of the circuit court\r\nof the county wherein it is situated, until otherwise provided by\r\nlaw, and the records of such corporation or hustings court shall\r\nthereupon become a part of the records of such circuit court, and\r\nbe transferred thereto, and remain therein until otherwise\r\nprovided by law, and during the existence of the corporation or\r\nhustings court, the circuit court of the county in which such city\r\nis situated, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with said\r\ncorporation or hustings court in all actions at law and suits in\r\nequity.\r\n\r\nSEC 99 For each city court of record a judge shall be chosen by\r\nthe joint vote of the two houses of the General Assembly.

All incorporated communities, having within defined\r\nboundaries a population of five thousand or more, shall be known\r\nas cities; and all incorporated communities having within defined\r\nboundaries a population of less than five thousand, shall be known\r\nas towns. In determining the population of such cities and towns\r\nthe General Assembly shall be governed by the last United States\r\ncensus, or such other enumeration as may be made by authority of\r\nthe General Assembly; but nothing in this section shall be\r\nconstrued to repeal the charter of any incorporated community of\r\nless than five thousand inhabitants having a city charter at the\r\ntime of the adoption of this Constitution, or to prevent the\r\nabolition by such incorporated communities of the corporation or\r\nhustings court thereof.\r\n\r\nSEC. 117.

If he approve he shall sign it, but if not, if the council\r\nconsist of two branches, he may return it, with his objections in\r\nwriting, to the clerk, or other recording officer, of that branch\r\nin which it originated; which branch shall enter the objections at\r\nlength on its journal and proceed to reconsider it. If after such\r\nconsideration two thirds of all the members elected thereto shall\r\nagree to pass the ordinance or resolution it shall be sent,\r\ntogether with the objections, to the other branch, by which it\r\nshall likewise be considered, and if approved by two thirds of all\r\nthe members elected thereto, it shall become operative\r\nnotwithstanding the objections of the mayor.

Upon such consideration the vote shall be\r\ntaken in the same manner as where the council consists of two\r\nbranches, and if the ordinance or resolution be approved by two\r\nthirds of all the members elected to the council, it shall become\r\noperative notwithstanding the objections of the mayor. If any\r\nordnance or resolution shall not be returned by the major within\r\nfive days (Sunday excepted), after it shall have been presented to\r\nhim, it shall become operative in like manner as if he had signed\r\nit, unless his term of office, or that of the council, shall\r\nexpire within said five days.\r\n\r\nThe mayor shall have the power to veto any particular item or\r\nitems of an appropriation, ordnance or resolution, but the veto\r\nshall not affect any item or items to which he does not object.\r\nThe item or items objected to shall not take effect except in the\r\nmanner provided in this section as to ordnances or resolutions not\r\napproved by the mayor.

So franchise, lease or light of any kind to use any such\r\npublic property or any other public property or easement of any\r\ndescription, in a manner not permitted to the general public,\r\nshall be granted for a longer period than thirty years. Before\r\nplanting any such franchise or privilege for a term of years,\r\nexcept for a trunk railway, the municipality shall first, after\r\ndue advertisement, reserve bids therefor publicly, in such manner\r\nas may be provided by law, and shall then act as may be required\r\nby law.

Until\r\notherwise provided by law, such appeal shall be taken in the\r\nmanner in which appeals may be taken to the Supreme Court of\r\nAppeals from the inferior courts, except that such an appeal shall\r\nbe of right, and the Supreme Court of Appeals may provide by rule\r\nfor proceedings in the matter of appeals in any particular in\r\nwhich the existing rules of law are inapplicable. If such appeal\r\nbe taken by the corporation whose rates, charges or\r\nclassifications of traffic, schedules, facilities, conveniences or\r\nservice are affected, the Commonwealth shall be made the appellee,\r\nbut, in the other cases mentioned the corporation so affected\r\nshall be made the appellee. The General Assembly may also, by\r\ngeneral laws, provide for appeals from any other action of the\r\ncommission, by the Commonwealth or by any person interested,\r\nirrespective of the amount involved. All appeals from the\r\ncommission shall be to the Supreme Court of Appeals only, aid in\r\nall appeals to which the Commonwealth is a party, it shall be\r\nrepresented by the Attorney General or his legally appointed\r\nrepresentative.

The commission, upon the\r\nexecution of such bond, shall forthwith require the appealing\r\ncompany, under penalty of the immediate enforcement (pending the\r\nappeal and notwithstanding any supersedeas), of the order or\r\nrequirement appealed from, to keep such accounts, and to make to\r\nthe commission, from time to time, such reports, verified by oath,\r\nas may, in the judgment of the commission, suffice to show the\r\namounts being charged or received by the company pending the\r\nappeal, in excess of the charge allowed by the action of the\r\ncommission appealed from, together with the names and addresses of\r\nthe persons to whom such overcharges will be refundable in case\r\nthe charges made by the company pending the appeal, be not\r\nsustained on such appeal, and the commission shall also, from time\r\nto time, require such company, under like penalty, to give\r\nadditional security on, or to increase, the said suspending bond,\r\nwhenever, in the opinion of the commission, the same may be\r\nnecessary to insure the prompt refunding of the overcharges\r\naforesaid. Upon the final decision of such appeal, all amounts\r\nwhich the appealing company may have collected, pending the\r\nappeal, in excess of that authorized by such final decision, shall\r\nbe promptly refunded by the company to the parties entitled\r\nthereto, in such manner, and through such methods of distribution,\r\nas may be prescribed by the commission, or by law. All such\r\nappeals affecting rates, charges or classifications of traffic,\r\nshall have precedence upon the docket of the appellate court, and\r\nshall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court, irrespective\r\nof its place of session, next after the habeas corpus, and\r\nCommonwealth's cases already on the docket of the court.\r\n\r\n(a) In no case of appeal from the commission shall any new or\r\nadditional evidence be introduced in the appellate court, but the\r\nchairman of the commission, under the seal of the commission,\r\nshall certify to the appellate court all the facts upon which the\r\naction appealed from was based and which may be essential for the\r\nproper decision of the appeal, together with such of the evidence\r\nintroduced before, or considered by, the commission as may be\r\nselected, specified and required to be certified, by any party in\r\ninterest, as well as such other evidence, so introduced or\r\nconsidered, as the commission may deem proper to certify. The\r\ncommission shall, whenever an appeal is taken therefrom, file with\r\nthe record of the case, and as a part thereof, a written statement\r\nof the reasons upon which the action appealed from was based, and\r\nsuch statement shall be lead and considered by the appellate\r\ncourt, upon disposing of the appeal. The appellate court shall\r\nhave jurisdiction, on such appeal, to consider and determine the\r\nreasonableness and justness of the action of the commission\r\nappealed from, as well as any other matter arising under such\r\nappeal provided, however, that the action of the commission\r\nappealed from shall be regarded as prima facie just, reasonable\r\nand correct, but the court may, when it deems necessary, in the\r\ninterest of justice, demand to the commission any case pending on\r\nappeal, and require the same to be further investigated by the\r\ncommission, and reported upon to the court (together with a\r\ncertificate of such additional evidence as may be tendered before\r\nthe commission by any party in interest), before the appeal is\r\nfinally decided.\r\n\r\n(b) Whenever the court, upon appeal, shall reverse an order of the\r\ncommission affecting the rates, charges or the classification of\r\ntraffic of any transportation or transmission company, it shall,\r\nat the same time, substitute therefor such order as in its\r\nopinion, the commission should have made at the time of entering\r\nthe order appealed from, otherwise the reversal order shall not be\r\nvalid. Such substituted order shall have the same force and effect\r\n(and none other) as if it had been entered by the commission at\r\nthe time the original order appealed from was entered. The right\r\nof the commission to prescribe and enforce rates, charges,\r\nclassifications, rules and regulations, affecting any or all\r\nactions of the commission theretofore entered by it and appealed\r\nfrom, but based upon circumstances or conditions different from\r\nthose existing at the time the order appealed from was made, shall\r\nnot be suspended or impaired by reason of the pendency of such\r\nappeal; but no order of the commission, prescribing or altering\r\nsuch rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations, shall\r\nbe retroactive.\r\n\r\n(h) The right of any person to institute and prosecute in the\r\nordinary courts of justice, any action, suit or motion against any\r\ntransportation or transmission company, for any claim or cause of\r\naction against such company, shall not be extinguished or\r\nimpaired, by reason of any fine or other penalty which the\r\ncommission may impose, or be authorized to impose, upon such\r\ncompany because of its breach of any public duty, or because of\r\nits failure to comply with any order or requirement of the\r\ncommission; but, in no such proceeding by any person against such\r\ncorporation, nor in any collateral proceeding, shall the\r\nreasonableness, justness or validity of any rate, charge,\r\nclassification or traffic, rule, regulation or requirement,\r\ntheretofore prescribed by the commission, within the scope of its\r\nauthority, and then in force, be questioned: provided, however,\r\nthat no ease based upon or involving any order of the commission\r\nshall be heard, or disposed of, against the objection of either\r\nparty, so long as such order is suspended in its operation by an\r\norder of the Supreme Court of Appeals as authorized by this\r\nConstitution or by any law passed in pursuance thereof.\r\n\r\n(i) The commission shall make annual reports to the Governor of\r\nits proceedings, in which reports it shall recommend, from time to\r\ntime, such new or additional legislation in reference to its\r\npowers or duties, or to the creation, supervision, regulation or\r\ncontrol of corporations, or to the subject of taxation, as it may\r\ndeem wise or expedient, or as may be required by law.\r\n\r\n(k) Upon the organization of the State Corporation Commission, the\r\nBoard of Public Works and the office of Railroad Commissioner,\r\nshall cease to exist; and all books, papers and documents\r\npertaining thereto, shall be transferred to, and become a part of\r\nthe records of, the office of the State Corporation Commission.\r\n\r\n(l) After the first day of January, nineteen hundred and five, in\r\naddition to the modes of amendment provided for in Article fifteen\r\nof this Constitution, the General Assembly, upon the\r\nrecommendation of the State Corporation Commission, may, by law,\r\nfrom time to time, amend sub-sections a to i, inclusive, of this\r\nsection, or any of them, or any such amendment thereof: provided,\r\nthat no amendment made under authority of this sub-section shall\r\ncontravene the provisions of any part of this Constitution other\r\nthan the sub-sections last above referred to or any such amendment\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nSEC. 157. Provision shall be made by general laws for the payment\r\nof a fee to the Commonwealth by every domestic corporation, upon\r\nthe granting, amendment or extension of its charter, and by every\r\nforeign corporation upon obtaining a license to do business in\r\nthis State as specified in this section; and also for the payment,\r\nby every domestic corporation, and foreign corporation doing\r\nbusiness in this State, of an annual registration fee of not less\r\nthan five dollars nor more than twenty-five dollars, which shall\r\nbe irrespective of any specific license, or other, tax imposed by\r\nlaw upon such company for the privilege of carrying on its\r\nbusiness in this State, or upon its franchise or property; and for\r\nthe making, by every such corporation (at the time of paying such\r\nannual registration fee), of such report to the State Corporation\r\nCommission, of the status, business or condition of such\r\ncorporation, as the General Assembly may prescribe. No foreign\r\ncorporation shall have authority to do business in this State,\r\nuntil it shall have first obtained from the commission a license\r\nto do business in this State, upon such terms and conditions as\r\nmay be prescribed by law. The failure by any corporation for two\r\nsuccessive years to pay its annual registration fee, or to make\r\nits said annual reports, shall, when such failure shall have\r\ncontinued for ninety days after the expiration of such two years,\r\noperate as a revocation and annulment of the charter of such\r\ncorporation if it be a domestic company, or, of its license to do\r\nbusiness in this State if it be a foreign company; and the General\r\nAssembly shall provide additional and suitable penalties for the\r\nfailure of any corporation to comply promptly with the\r\nrequirements of this section, or of any laws passed in pursuance\r\nthereof. The commission shall compel all corporations to comply\r\npromptly with such requirements, by enforcing, in the manner\r\nhereinbefore authorized, such fines and penalties against the\r\ndelinquent company as may be provided for, or authorized by, this\r\narticle; but the General Assembly may relieve from the payment of\r\nthe said registration fee any purely charitable institution or\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nSEC. 158.
