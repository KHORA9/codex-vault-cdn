In carrying out this idea, I\r\nhave made use of information given in the well-known books on Persia by\r\nMalcolm, Fraser, Watson and Curzon.\r\n\r\n'Persia Revisited,' as first written, comprised up to Chapter VI. of the\r\nbook; but just as I had finished it for publication, the sad news of the\r\nassassination of the Shah, Nasr-ed-Din, was received. I then saw that my\r\nbook, to be complete, should touch on the present situation in Persia,\r\nand accordingly I added two chapters which deal with the new Shah and\r\nhis brothers, and the Sadr Azem and the succession.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are from photographs by M. Sevragine of Tehran, with\r\nthe exception of the likeness of H.I.M. the Shah Mozuffer-ed-Din, and\r\nthat of H.H. Ali Asghar Khan, Sadr Azem, which latter, by Messrs. W. and\r\nD. Downey, of Ebury Street, London, is published by their kind\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nT.E.

Their saying, '_Avval rafîk, baad tarîk_' (First a\r\ncompanion, then the road), is one which most travellers can fully\r\nappreciate. Accordingly, when planning a trip in the autumn of 1895 to\r\nthe Land of Iran, I cast about for a companion, and was fortunate enough\r\nto meet with two friends, both going that way, and who, moreover, like\r\nmyself, had previously journeyed in Persia.\r\n\r\nWe decided to take the Odessa route to Batoum, and we went by Berlin,\r\nOderberg, and Lemberg. At Odessa we found that a less expensive, and\r\nmore comfortable, though perhaps half a day longer route, lies by\r\nWarsaw. On that line there are fewer changes, and only one Customs\r\nexamination, whereas by, Oderberg there are two examinations, Austrian\r\nand Russian. Moreover, through tickets are issued _viâ_ Warsaw, a\r\nconvenience not provided _viâ_ Oderberg--fresh tickets and re-booking of\r\nluggage being necessary there, and again both at Pod Voloczyska and\r\nVoloczyska, on the Austrian and Russian frontiers. We came in for a\r\ncrowded train of first-class passengers going from the Vienna direction\r\nto Jalta, a favourite seaside place in the Crimea, which has two\r\nfashionable seasons--spring and autumn. These people were making for the\r\naccelerated mail-steamer, which leaves Odessa for Batoum every Wednesday\r\nduring the summer service, touching at Sebastopol, Jalta, and\r\nNovorossisk. We were making for the same steamer, and found crowded\r\ncabins. The mass of luggage to be examined at Voloczyska caused much\r\nconfusion and delay, and it was only by discreetly managed appeals to\r\nthe working staff that we were able to push our way and pass on,\r\nwithout anything being left behind. There appeared to be orders for very\r\nspecial examination of books and papers at Voloczyska, and these were\r\ncarried out in a foolishly perfunctory manner. In my luggage, the man\r\nwho searched passed over a bulky tourist writing-case, but carried off\r\nto a superior a Continental Bradshaw, a blank notebook, and a packet of\r\nuseful paper, notwithstanding my open show of their innocence. The man\r\nsoon returned with another official, who smiled at the mistake, and good\r\nnaturedly helped to close up my baggage.\r\n\r\nWe began our journey well by a rapid run to Odessa, arriving there on\r\nthe day of departure of the fast boat, and landing at Batoum in six and\r\na half days from London. The steamers on this service are about 2,500\r\ntons, 2,400 horse-power, with large accommodation for passengers. The\r\ncabins are comfortable, and the saloons excellent and well served, and\r\nall are lit with the electric light. These boats are, I believe,\r\nTyne-built. They are broad of beam, and behave well in bad weather.\r\nNovorossisk is a growing great port, situated in a very pretty bay. It\r\nhas lately been joined by railway to the main trunk line connecting with\r\nMoscow, and passing through Rostov. This connection enables it to\r\nattract considerable trade from the Don and the Volga, and also to take\r\nmuch from Rostov and Taganrog, when the Azov approaches are closed with\r\nice. A very fine sea-wall, to give effectual protection to the railway\r\nloading-piers, and the shipping generally, is now being completed at a\r\ntotal cost of £850,000. Novorossisk is said to have the biggest\r\n'elevator' in the world. The scenery all along the coast, from the\r\nCrimea to Batoum, is very fine, and in autumn the voyage is most\r\nenjoyable.\r\n\r\nWe left Batoum on the night of the day of our arrival. The departure of\r\nthe through train to Baku had been changed from morning to night, and\r\nthis allowed of travelling by day over that part of the line which\r\nbefore used to be passed at night. We had previously seen Tiflis, and\r\ntherefore did not break our journey. The weather was warm, but not such\r\nas to cause discomfort. As we approached Tiflis the carriages and\r\nbuffets became crowded to excess, with townspeople returning from\r\nSaturday-to-Monday holiday, the fine weather having enticed them out to\r\nvarious places along the line. The railway-carriages on the Batoum-Baku\r\nline are very comfortable, and the refreshment-rooms are frequent and\r\nwell provided, so travelling there is made easy and pleasant. The\r\njourney occupies thirty-two hours.\r\n\r\nWe reached Baku on September 16, the ninth day from London, and arranged\r\nto leave for Enzelli, on the Persian coast, the port for Tehran, at\r\nmidnight the next day. Through the kindness of a member of the Greek\r\nhouse of Kousis, Theophylactos and Co., we were shown over the oil-wells\r\nand refineries belonging to M. Taghioff, a millionaire of Persian origin\r\n(the name probably was Taghi Khan). The story goes that, on becoming\r\nwealthy through the oil industry in its early days, he presented the\r\nyoung township with a church, school-house, and hospital, and, in\r\nrecognition of his generous public spirit, the Government gave him a\r\ngrant of the waste land on which his works now stand, and out of which\r\nmillions of roubles have come to him from oil-springs. Our visit had the\r\nappearance of bringing him luck in the form of a new fountain rush. We\r\nhad seen all the works and wells; none of the latter were flowing, and\r\nthe usual steam-pumping was going on. We were about to leave, when a\r\ncommotion at the wells attracted our attention, and we saw the dark\r\nfluid spouting up from two to three hundred feet through the open top of\r\nthe high-peaked wooden roof erected over each of the wells. On hurrying\r\nback, we saw the great iron cap, which is swung vertically when the pump\r\nis working, lowered and fixed at some height over the mouth of the well,\r\nto drive the outward flow down into the hollow all round and out into\r\nthe ditch leading to the reservoirs. The force of the gush was shown by\r\nthe roar of the dash against the iron cap, and the upward rush had the\r\nappearance of a solid quivering column. The flow was calculated at fifty\r\nthousand gallons an hour. The business of refining is generally in the\r\nhands of others than the producers; but some of the larger\r\nfirms--notably the Rothschilds, Nobel Brothers, and Taghioff--are both\r\nproducers and refiners. This means of course, the employment of very,\r\nmuch larger capital.\r\n\r\nThere is a great dash of the gambling element in the oil-well business\r\nat Baku. Large sums are spent in boring operations, and success so\r\noften stands off that all available capital is sunk in the ground and\r\nswallowed up. Even with good signs, it is impossible to foresee the\r\nresults or the extent of production, and there is also an extraordinary\r\nirregularity in the outcome of the separate naphtha-bearing plots. An\r\ninstance was mentioned to me of a peasant proprietor who had made enough\r\nmoney on which to live sumptuously, but he hungered for more, and\r\nengaged in further boring operations. He was on the verge of losing\r\neverything, when oil was suddenly struck, and he made a fortune. He\r\nlaboured hard himself, and literally went to sleep a poor working man,\r\nand awoke to find his dream of riches realized.\r\n\r\nBaku has been immensely improved in every way of late, and now has good\r\nstreets, hotels, and shops. Water, which was a great want before, is\r\nwell supplied from condensers which belong to the town. The rise in the\r\nvalue of house property and building sites within the last ten years has\r\nbeen enormous, and great part of the money thus made has gone to native\r\nowners, Persians (or Tartars, as all Mohammedans are called here), and I\r\nwas told of a plot of building ground with a small house on it, which\r\nhad been originally bought for 600 roubles, being lately sold for\r\n30,000. The town is growing in size, and new buildings are rising, which\r\ngive an appearance of prosperity and increasing trade. The harbour is\r\ncrowded with steamers and sailing vessels, and the wharfs present a busy\r\nsight. The loading and unloading is quickly done by steam-cranes and\r\npowerful porters, who come in numbers from the Persian districts of\r\nKhalkhal and Ardabil. I watched with much interest a gang of these men\r\nat work. They were wonderfully quick, quiet, and methodical in their\r\nways, and showed great capacity for handling and carrying heavy weights.\r\n\r\nBaku swarms with Persians, resident and migratory. They are seen\r\neverywhere--as shopkeepers, mechanics, masons, carpenters, coachmen,\r\ncarters, and labourers, all in a bustle of business, so different from\r\nPersians, at home. Climate or want of confidence produces indolence\r\nthere, but here and elsewhere out of Persia they show themselves to be\r\nactive, energetic, and very intelligent. They are in great numbers at\r\nall the censes of trade in the adjoining countries--at Constantinople,\r\nDamascus, Aleppo, Baghdad, Tiflis, Askhabad, and other towns. Most of\r\nthe new buildings in Tiflis were built by Persians, and thousands were\r\nengaged in the construction of the Trans-Caspian Railway. The permanent\r\nworkmen now employed on it are largely Persians, and Askhabad has a\r\nresident population of over twelve thousand. There were said to be\r\ntwenty thousand Persians, from the provinces of Azerbaijan and Hamadan,\r\nworking last summer on the new railway from Tiflis to Alexandropol and\r\nKars, now being built, and doubtless many of them will permanently\r\nsettle on the line.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there are half a million thus located and working out of\r\nPersia, but I think that this is an exaggerated estimate. Most of them\r\nretain their nationality, for while they grumble loudly in their own\r\ncountry, yet when away they swear by it, and save money steadily to\r\nenable them to return home. Their nomadic character is the cause of this\r\nreadiness to seek employment abroad. I was told that in 1894-95 twenty\r\nthousand Persian passports were issued from the Embassy in\r\nConstantinople. This would include pilgrims as well as home visitors.\r\nIt is this love of country (not in the sense, however, of patriotism as\r\nunderstood in the West) which makes a Persian cling to his national\r\nrepresentative abroad, and willingly pay for frequent registration as a\r\nsubject who is entitled to protection and permission to return home\r\nwhenever he may choose. As a rule, the Persian abroad always appears in\r\nthe distinctive national dress--the tall black lambskin cap and the coat\r\nwith ample skirt of many pleats.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the Persian porters who are seen at Baku; they are also\r\nto be found at Petrovsk and Astrachan, and are generally preferred to\r\nthe local labourers, who, in common with their class in Russia, take a\r\nlong drink once a week, often unfitting them for their work the\r\nfollowing day. The Persians are of sober habits, and can be relied upon\r\nfor regular attendance at the wharfs and loading-stages. They have\r\nlearnt, however, to take an occasional taste of the _rakivodka_ spirit,\r\nand when reminded that they are Mohammedans, say that the indulgence was\r\nprohibited when no one worked hard. These porters are men of powerful\r\nphysique, and display very great strength in bearing separate burdens;\r\nbut they cannot work together and make a joint effort to raise heavy\r\nloads, beyond the power of one man. Singly, they are able to lift and\r\ncarry eighteen poods, Russian weight, equal to six hundred and\r\nforty-eight pounds English.\r\n\r\nIn the newspaper correspondence on the burning Armenian Question, I have\r\nseen allusion made to the poor physique of the Armenian people; but as\r\nfar as my observation goes in Persia, Russian Armenia, and the Caucasus,\r\nthere is no marked difference between them and the local races, and on\r\nthe railway between Baku and Tiflis Armenian porters of powerful form\r\nare common, where contract labour rates attract men stronger than their\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nThough much of the wealth which has come out of the Baku oil-fields has\r\nbeen carried away by foreign capitalists, yet much remains with the\r\ninhabitants, and the investment of this has promoted trade in the\r\nCaspian provinces, and multiplied the shipping. There are now between\r\none hundred and eighty and two hundred steamers on the Caspian, besides\r\na large number of sailing craft of considerable size, in which German\r\nand Swedish, as well as Armenian and Tartar-Persian, capital is\r\nemployed. The Volga Steam Navigation Company is divided into two\r\ncompanies--one for the river, and the other for the Caspian. The latter\r\nowns six large steamers, with cargo capacity of from sixty to eighty\r\nthousand poods, liquid measurement, for oil-tank purposes, equalling\r\nnine hundred to twelve hundred tons. They have German under-officers,\r\nand Russian captains. It is likely that the German officers come from\r\nthe German colonies on the Volga, and probably some of the capital also\r\ncomes from that quarter. This Volga Steam Navigation Company was\r\nestablished over fifty years ago by a Scotchman, named Anderson, and\r\nsome of the vessels first built are still used on the river as\r\ncargo-boats.\r\n\r\nMany of the best steamers on the Caspian are officered by Swedes and\r\nFinns, most of whom speak English, acquired whilst serving in English\r\nships sailing to all parts of the globe. The Mercury Company, which runs\r\nthe superior steamers and carries the mails on the Caspian, has Swedish\r\nand Finn officers, but it is said that they are now to be replaced by\r\nRussian naval officers as vacancies occur. This company's vessels are\r\nwell appointed, have good cabins, and are fitted with the electric\r\nlight. But the best of Caspian mail-boats are most uncomfortable in\r\nrough weather for all but those whom no motion whatever can affect.\r\nOwing to the shoal water on all the coast circumference of this sea, the\r\nbig boats are necessarily keelless, and may be described as but great\r\nbarges with engines, and when at anchor in a rolling sea their movement\r\nis terribly disturbing.\r\n\r\nWe embarked in the _Admiral Korneiloff_, one of the Mercury Company's\r\nbest boats, on the night of September 17, and arrived at Enzelli on the\r\nmorning of the 19th. I was amused on the voyage to hear the sailors'\r\nversion of the story how the Caspian became a Russian sea, on which no\r\narmed Persian vessel can sail. The sovereignty of this Persian sea was\r\nceded to Russia by the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, and the sailors say\r\nthat on the Shah being pressed over and over again to consent, and\r\ndesiring to find some good excuse to do so, a courtier, seeing the royal\r\ninclination, remarked that Persia suffered sorely from salt soil and\r\nwater, which made land barren, and that sea-water was of no use for\r\nirrigation, nor any other good purpose. The Shah on this asked if it\r\nwere really true that the water of the Caspian was salt, and on being\r\nassured that it was, he said the Russians might have the whole of it.\r\n\r\nWe found an improvement at Enzelli in the form of a hotel kept by a\r\nGreek, with accommodation good enough to be very welcome. We had\r\nexcellent fresh salmon at breakfast, which reminded me of the doubt that\r\nhas often been expressed of the true salmon being found in an inland\r\nsea. The Caspian fish is a genuine salmon of the same habits as the\r\nmarine species known in Europe, with the one sad exception that it will\r\nnot look at nor touch fly or bait in any form or shape, and therefore\r\ngives no sport for the rod. The trout in the upper waters of the streams\r\nthat the salmon run up, take the fly freely and give good sport, but all\r\nattempts by keen and clever fishermen to hook a salmon have failed. The\r\nfish are largely netted, and same are sent to Tehran packed in ice,\r\nwhile a good business is done in salting what cannot be sold fresh. The\r\nexistence of salmon in this inland salt sea, which lies eighty-four feet\r\nbelow the level of the ocean, is supposed to be due to its connection\r\nwith the open sea having been cut off by a great upheaval in the\r\nprehistoric time.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we were confronted with a functionary new to us in\r\nPersia, one charged with the demand for passports and their examination.\r\nHe is prepared to provide passports for those arriving without them, and\r\nto _visé_ when this has not been previously done. Considering the\r\npractice in force with Persia's near neighbour, and the crowd of\r\ndeck-passengers always coming and going, it was not likely that this\r\nformality as a source of income would fail to be adopted. The linguistic\r\neducational qualification for the post is evidently confined to Russian,\r\nfor on finding that I spoke Persian, the officer asked me for the\r\ninformation he pretended to seek from the English passports. He\r\nacknowledged the farce he was called upon to play, and we proceeded\r\nwithout any farther inquiry. The day was warm, but not oppressively so;\r\nthe sea-breeze helped the boat across the lagoon and up the Pir-i-Bazaar\r\nstream, and the weather being dry, we reached Resht in carriages By the\r\nMobarakabad route, without the splashing plunging through a sea of mud\r\nwhich is the general disagreeable experience of the main road.\r\n\r\nThe Enzelli Lagoon is a swarming haunt of numerous kinds of wild-fowl\r\nand fishing birds. Conspicuous among the waders in the shallows and on\r\nthe shore are the pelican and the stork. The place is a paradise to\r\nthem, teeming with fish and frog food. One of my companions described\r\nwhat he had witnessed in a struggle with a wounded stork in the shallow\r\nwater of this lagoon. He and a friend were out after wild-duck, and his\r\nfriend, desiring to bag a giant stork, which looked splendid in his\r\nstrongly contrasted pure white and deep black plumage, fired, and\r\nwounded the bird. His Persian servant, with thoughts intent on cooking\r\nit, ran, knife in hand, to cut its throat in the orthodox manner, so as\r\nto make it lawful for a Mohammedan to eat. The bird, on being seized,\r\nstruggled hard with its captor, and, snapping its elongated bill widely\r\nin wild terror, by accident got the man's head jammed between its\r\nmandibles. The keen cutting edges of the long strong beak scarified the\r\nman's cheeks, and made him scream with pain and with frantic fear that\r\nit was _his_ throat which was being cut. His master went to his\r\nassistance and released him by wrenching open the stork's bill, but he\r\nwas so occupied with supporting his swooning servant that time was given\r\nfor the wounded stork to hurry away in safety, flapping its long wings\r\nand snapping its powerful beak, as is the habit of this voiceless bird,\r\nwith all the appearance of triumph.\r\n\r\nEnzelli is becoming the port of entry, for the North of Persia, of tea\r\nfrom India and China. Till within a very short time most of the tea for\r\nPersia, Trans-Caspia, and Russian Turkistan so far as Samarkand, passed\r\nup from Bombay by the Persian Gulf ports. The late reduction in Russian\r\nrailway charges, and the low sea-freights from the East in the\r\noil-steamers returning to Batoum, have brought about this change.\r\nArrangements have been made for transit to Baku of Russian-owned tea\r\nconsigned to Persia on special terms of Customs drawback, and it is now\r\nsold cheaper in Resht than in Baku, where it has a heavy duty added to\r\nthe price. The thin muslin-like manufactures of India, in demand in\r\nCentral Asia for wear in the hot dry summer, and which found their way\r\nthere from the Persian Gulf, are now following the same route as the\r\ntea. Thus, steam and waterway are competing still more with the camel,\r\nto make the longest way round the shortest one in point of time, and the\r\ncheapest to the customers' homes.\r\n\r\nAs with tea, so Russian beet-sugar is cheaper at Enzelli-Resht than at\r\nBaku, owing to the State bounty on export. The consumption of tea and\r\nsugar, already large in Persia, is certain to increase in the North\r\nthrough this development of Russian trade. French beet-sugar continues\r\nto compete by way of Trebizond to Tabriz, but if the experiment now\r\nbeing tried of manufacturing sugar in the vicinity of Tehran from beet\r\nsucceeds, the Persians will benefit further by competition.\r\n\r\nThe Russian trade in Persia is mostly in the hands of Armenians, some of\r\nwhom have amassed considerable wealth. It is only in the West that the\r\nJew is regarded as the sample of superior sharpness in the walks of life\r\nthat call for the exercise of the qualities most necessary in the\r\noperation of getting the better of one's neighbour. In the East both the\r\nGreek and the Armenian are ahead of him in this respect, and the popular\r\nsaying is, 'One Greek equals two Jews, and one Armenian equals two\r\nGreeks.' But, to the credit of the Armenian traders, it should be said\r\nthat they are bold and enterprising in a newly-opened country, as well\r\nas clever in an old one. It may be here mentioned that there is no\r\nopening in Persia for the native Jew; he is there refused the facilities\r\nwhich lead to wealth, and is strictly confined to the poorest\r\noccupations. It is not unlikely that the severe treatment of the Jews in\r\nPersia has its origin in the hatred inspired by the conduct of\r\nSaad-u-Dowleh, a Jewish physician, who rose to the position of Supreme\r\nVazir under the King Arghoun Khan, in 1284. This Minister owed his\r\nadvancement to his pleasing manners and agreeable conversation, and he\r\ngained such an ascendancy over his weak royal master as to be allowed to\r\nremove all Mohammedans from places of trust and profit, and even to\r\ncarry his persecution to the length of commanding that no one professing\r\nthat faith should appear at Court. The Eastern Christians were then much\r\nmore prominent and numerous than they afterwards became, and\r\nSaad-u-Dowleh sank his people's dislike of the Nazarene in his greater\r\nhate of the Mohammedan, so that he employed the former to replace the\r\nfollowers of the Arabian Prophet whom he dismissed from office and\r\nbanished from Court. The penalty of death was exacted for this\r\npersecution, for Saad-u-Dowleh was murdered almost at the same instant\r\nthat his sovereign master expired.\r\n\r\nThe silk trade of Resht, which has suffered so much for many years from\r\nthe disease that attacked the silkworms in the Caspian provinces, and\r\nspread to all the Persian silk districts, is now recovering. The\r\nintroduction of cellular seed has been attended with much success, and\r\nthere is a rapidly-increasing export of cocoons. The fresh start in this\r\nold industry has given an impetus to mulberry-tree cultivation, and\r\nwaste land is in considerable demand for planting purposes.\r\n\r\nAn attempt is now being made to grow tea on the low hills near Batoum.\r\nIt is not yet known what may be the ultimate chances of success, but\r\nalready what is being done there is having the effect of suggesting a\r\nsimilar experiment near Resht. The conditions of the soil on many of the\r\nwooded hill-slopes in the Persian Caspian provinces, where every\r\ngradation of climate and atmosphere can be met with, appear to be well\r\nadapted for the tea-plant. The cart-road to Kasvin, now being\r\nconstructed by a Russian company, will pass through some of these\r\nwell-favoured parts, and this will help to draw attention to natural\r\nresources which have hitherto been unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAs old Persian travellers, we were at once reminded of our return to the\r\nland of complimentary address and extravagant phrase by the frequent\r\nreply '_Chashm_' (My eye!), the simple slang expression known in our\r\ncountry, and which 'Trilby' has made better known by its introduction on\r\nthe stage. The word is an abbreviation of '_Ba sar o chashm'_ (By my\r\nhead and eyes! May my eyes be put out, and my head taken off, if I obey\r\nnot!). We also heard the similar but less formal reply _Chira_?\r\nWhy?--meaning, why not? why should I not do as you desire? i.e. you will\r\nbe obeyed.\r\n\r\nWe travelled to Kasvin, halfway to Tehran, over the execrable road which\r\nleads from Resht. For the first forty miles the landscape was lovely\r\nfrom wooded slopes, green growth and clear running water. The\r\npost-houses are just as they were--ill-provided, and affording the very\r\nsmallest degree of comfort that it is possible for a 'rest-house' to\r\ngive. They had been in some way improved for the reception of General\r\nPrince Karaupatkin, and his suite, who visited Tehran to announce to the\r\nShah the accession of H.I.M. Nicolas II.; but no effort to maintain the\r\nimprovement had been made, except in one place--Menzil. The _on dit_ in\r\nTehran was, that the successful launching of the Russian cart-road\r\nenterprise, now fairly well in hand, is entirely due to Prince\r\nKaraupatkin's strong representation on his return to St. Petersburg. He\r\nis said to have taken the opportunity of telling the Shah, in answer as\r\nto his journey up, that he was greatly surprised to find the road\r\nleading to the capital such a very bad one; whereupon his Majesty\r\nremarked that the blame lay with his own countrymen, who, after begging\r\nfor a monopoly concession to construct a good road, had held on to it\r\nand done nothing, and they had the right, so long as the contract time\r\nallowed, to prevent others from making the road. The Russian press,\r\nwhich interested itself in the matter, pointed out that what was wanted\r\nto give an impetus to their trade in North Persia was good roads, not\r\nbounties, and it may be that the interest which is believed to be\r\nguaranteed by the Government on the road capital will take the place of\r\ntrade bounties. The money subscribed is sufficient to provide a\r\nsolidly-built road, and the idea is that it will be aligned so as to be\r\nfit for railway purposes in the future. The existing cart-road from\r\nKasvin to Tehran is but a track, lined out fairly straight over a level\r\nbit of high-lying country, with a few bridges over small streams. The\r\ndistance, ninety-five miles, is comfortably covered in fourteen to\r\neighteen hours in carriages drawn by three horses. The nature of the\r\nground makes this road a good fair-weather one, and as the Russian\r\ncompany has rented it from the Persian concessionnaire, we may expect to\r\nhear of considerable improvements, so as to encourage an increase of the\r\nPersian waggon traffic which already exists on it. The completion of a\r\nsystem of quick communication between the Russian Caspian Sea base and\r\nthe capital of Persia must attract the practical attention of all who\r\nare interested in Persian affairs.\r\n\r\nMany of the Moullas, in their character as meddlers, are always ready to\r\nstep forward in opposition to all matters and measures in which they\r\nhave not been consulted and conciliated. So the Russian road from Resht\r\nwas pronounced to be a subject for public agitation by the Tabriz\r\nMujtahid, Mirza Javad Agha, who, since his successful contest over the\r\nTobacco Régie, has claimed to be one of the most important personages in\r\nPersia. This priest is very rich, and is said to be personally\r\ninterested in trade and 'wheat corners' at Tabriz, and as he saw that\r\nthe new road was likely to draw away some of the Tabriz traffic, he set\r\nhimself the task of stirring up the Moullas of Resht to resent, on\r\nreligious grounds, the extended intrusion of Europeans into their town.\r\nThe pretence of zeal in the cause was poor, because the Resht Moullas\r\nare themselves interested in local prosperity, and the agitation failed.\r\n\r\nA change is coming over the country in regard to popular feeling towards\r\npriestly interference in personal and secular affairs. The claim to have\r\ncontrol of the concerns of all men may now be said to be but the first\r\nflush of the fiery zeal of divinity students, fresh from the red-hot\r\nteachings of bigoted Moulla masters, who regret the loss of their old\r\nsupremacy, and view with alarm the spread of Liberalism, which seems now\r\nto be establishing itself in Persia.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate episode of the Tobacco Régie in 1891 gave the Moullas a\r\nchance to assert themselves, and they promptly seized the opportunity to\r\nchampion a popular cause of discontent, and the pity of it was that the\r\nenterprise which raised the disturbance was English. This tobacco\r\nmonopoly had been pictured as a business certain to produce great gains,\r\nand the people were thus prepared for the reports which were spread of\r\nhigh prices to be charged on what they regard as almost a necessary of\r\nlife. The conditions of the country were not fully studied before the\r\nmonopoly powers were put in force. A suggestion was made that the\r\ncompany's operations should be confined at first to the foreign export,\r\nwhich would have returned a good profit, and that afterwards a beginning\r\nshould be made at Tehran, to prove to the people that the monopoly would\r\nreally give them better tobacco, and not raise prices, which the company\r\nclaimed would be the result of their system. But everything was planned\r\non an extensive scale, and so were prospective profits. The picture of a\r\nrapid road to fortune had been exhibited, and it was therefore decided\r\nthat the full right of monopoly should be established at once. An\r\nimprudent beginning was made in exercising the right of search in a\r\nmanner which alarmed some people for the privacy of their homes, a\r\ndangerous suggestion in a Mohammedan community.\r\n\r\nThe suspicions and fears of all--buyers, sellers, and smokers--were\r\neasily worked upon by the priests, ever ready to assert the supremacy of\r\nthe Church over the State. And then the biggest 'strike' I know of took\r\nplace. Mirza Hassan, the High-Priest of Kerbela, the most sacred shrine\r\nof the Shiah Mohammedans, declared tobacco in Persia to be 'unlawful' to\r\nthe true believer, and everyone--man, woman, and child--was forbidden to\r\nsell or smoke it. The 'strike' took place on a gigantic scale, a million\r\nor two certainly being engaged in it, and steps were taken to see the\r\norder from Kerbela carried out rigorously. 'Vigilance men,' under the\r\nMoullas' directions, made raids on suspected tea-shops, to find and\r\nsmash the 'kalian' pipes which form part of the stock-in-trade of\r\nthese places of refreshment. The Shah was faced with the sight of silent\r\nand forsaken tea-shops as he passed through the streets of Tehran, and\r\nhe saw the signs of the censuring strike in the rows of empty benches,\r\non which his subjects used to sit at their simple enjoyment of pipes and\r\ntea. The interdiction reached the inner homes of all, and even in the\r\n_anderuns_ and boudoirs of the highest (all of which are smoking-rooms)\r\nit was rigidly obeyed. The priestly prohibition penetrated to the\r\npalaces, and royalty found authority set at defiance in this matter. A\r\nprincely personage, a non-smoker, is said to have long urged and\r\nentreated a harem favourite, too deeply devoted to tobacco, to moderate\r\nher indulgence in it, but to no effect. On the strike being ordered, she\r\nat once joined it, and his Highness is reported to have said, 'My\r\nentreaties were in vain, my bribes of jewels were refused, yet the\r\npriest prevails.' And this was at a place where not long before Moullas\r\nhad been at a discount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIPE BEARER IN A PERSIAN ANDERUN]\r\n\r\nThere are now signs of the people resenting the arrogant assumption or\r\npower by the Moullas, and freeing themselves from their thraldom. There\r\nhas always been great liberty of opinion and speech in Persia, and six\r\nhundred years ago the poets Khayyam and Hafiz took full advantage of\r\nthis in expressing their contempt for the 'meddling Moullas.' Not very\r\nlong ago the donkey-boys in one of the great towns would on occasion\r\nreflect the popular feeling by the shout '_Br-r-r-o akhoond!_' (Go on,\r\npriest!) when they saw a Moulla pattering along on his riding donkey.\r\n_Biro_ is Persian for 'go on,' and, rolled and rattled out long and\r\nloud, is the cry when droves of load-carrying donkeys are driven. The\r\ndonkey-boy in Persia is as quick with bold reply as he is in Egypt and\r\nelsewhere. There is a story that a high Persian official called out to a\r\nboy, whose gang of burden-bearing donkeys obstructed his carriage, 'Out\r\nof the way, ass, you driver of asses!' and was promptly answered, 'You\r\nare an ass yourself, though a driver of men!'\r\n\r\nAs a finish to this reference to the Tobacco Régie in Persia, I may\r\nmention it is believed that, had the company started as ordinary\r\ntraders, they, having the command of ready money, would have succeeded\r\nwell. The commencement made in the centres of tobacco cultivation\r\nimpressed the peasant producers most favourably; they appreciated the\r\nadvantages of cash payments, and regretted the cessation of the system,\r\nand the governors benefited by the readiness with which the taxes were\r\npaid. But the explanation of monopoly, a word which was then unknown in\r\nPersia, raised the fears of the people, and those who had the money to\r\nspare laid in a supply of tobacco before the concession came into force.\r\nThis was regarded by the poor as proof of the coming rise in price, and\r\nthey therefore hailed the Moullas as their deliverers from the\r\nthreatened calamity of dear tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe only public debt of Persia is that of a loan contracted in order to\r\npay the compensation for cancelment of this concession, and the expenses\r\nwhich had been incurred; but the sale by the Government of the foreign\r\nexport (part of the cancelled concession) very nearly provides for the\r\nloan. The Société de 'Tombac' of Constantinople, which bought the\r\nmonopoly of export, has had difficulties to contend with, caused by a\r\nPersian combination to buy from the cultivators and sell to the foreign\r\nagents. A prominent Moulla was named as interested in this business,\r\nwhich was in reality at direct variance with the principles on which the\r\npriesthood had declared the original concession to be 'unlawful.' This\r\ninterference with the free trade conditions existing when the\r\nConstantinople company made its contract led to a dispute, which ended\r\nwith a fresh agreement, in which there is said to be a stipulation that,\r\nshould the Persian Tobacco Régie in its original form be revived at any\r\ntime, French subjects are to have the first offer.\r\n\r\nAfter disposing of the Tobacco Régie, the triumphant Moullas desired to\r\nextend their prohibition to all foreign enterprise in Persia, and they\r\npronounced against the English Bank, which was doing its work quietly,\r\nand without detriment to the business of others. But the Shah gave them\r\nclearly to understand that their pretensions would be permitted no\r\nfurther, and that they were to cease from troubling. They then made an\r\nattempt to establish the impression of their power in a visible sign on\r\nall men, by commanding discontinuance of the Persian fashion of shaving\r\nthe chin, so that the beard should be worn in accordance with Mohammedan\r\ncustom. Again they talked of organizing coercion gangs, to enforce the\r\norder on the barbers, under threat of wrecking their shops. At this time\r\na foreign diplomat, during an audience of the Shah, on being asked by\r\nhis Majesty, according to his wont, what news there was in the European\r\nquarter of the town, mentioned this latest phase of Moulla agitation as\r\ntending to unsettle men's minds. The Shah passed his hand lightly over\r\nhis shaven chin, and said, with a touch of humour and royal assurance:\r\n'See, I shave; let them talk; they can do nothing.'\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to suppose that the people of Persia are dead to all desire\r\nfor progress, and that their religion is a bar to such desire. It is not\r\nso. Many of the Moullas, it is true, are opposed to education and\r\nprogress. One frankly said of the people in reference to education,\r\n'They will read the Koran for themselves, and what will be left for us\r\nto do?' The country is advancing in general improvement, slowly, but yet\r\nmoving forward; not standing still or sliding back, as some say. The\r\nMoulla struggles in 1891-92 to gain the upper hand produced a feeling of\r\nunquiet, and the most was made of all grievances, so as to fan the\r\nflames of discontent. Pestilent priests paraded the country, and did\r\ntheir utmost to excite religious fanaticism against the Government.\r\nThese agitators spoke so loudly and rashly that the ire of the old\r\nreligious leaders, the higher Moullas, men of learning and tranquil\r\ntemper, who had not joined the party of retrogression, was roused. The\r\nknowledge of this emboldened the sober-minded to speak out against the\r\narrogance and conceit of the new self-elected leaders. Open expression\r\nof opinion led to the criticism, 'These priests will next desire to rule\r\nover us.' The Nomads, who have always declined to be priest-ridden, also\r\nshowed that they were ready to resist any attempts to establish a\r\nreligious supremacy in temporal affairs; and then, by judicious\r\nmanagement of rival jealousies and conflicting interests, the Shah\r\nsucceeded in his policy of complete assertion of the royal power. It may\r\nbe that the Moullas were made to understand that, just as the Chief\r\nPriest had risen at a great assembly before Nadir Shah, and advised him\r\nto confine himself to temporal affairs, and not to interfere in matters\r\nof religion, so similar sound advice in the reverse order was given for\r\ntheir guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n--The late Shah's long reign\r\n--His camp life\r\n--Habits\r\n--Appearance\r\n--Persian Telegraph Intelligence Department\r\n--Farming the revenues\r\n--Condition of the people\r\n--The shoe question\r\n--The customs\r\n--Importation of arms\r\n--Martini-Henry rifles\r\n--Indo-European telegraph\r\n\r\n\r\nNasr-ed-din Shah was the two hundred and fifty-fourth Sovereign who had\r\nsuccessively ascended the throne of Persia. He succeeded his father,\r\nMahomed Shah, on September 10, 1848, and would have entered on his\r\njubilee, the fiftieth year of his reign, according to the Mohammedan\r\ncalendar, on May 6, 1896, had not his life been suddenly cut short by a\r\ndastardly assassin on Friday, May 1. This was, I think, the longest\r\nreign of any Persian monarch that can be ascertained with historical\r\naccuracy, except that of Shah Tamasp, who died A.D. 1576, after\r\noccupying the throne for fifty-three years; but this credits him with\r\nhaving begun his reign at the age of ten years. Nasr-ed-Din Shah\r\nascended the throne at the age of seventeen. Up to the last his Majesty\r\nwas remarkable as retaining all his physical and mental energies; his\r\nhealth was excellent, due no doubt to his love of nomadic life and its\r\nsimple habits. He was passionately fond of the chase, and passed much of\r\nhis time in the saddle. It might well be said of him, as of the ancient\r\nPersian monarchs, that the royal edicts were written 'at the stirrup of\r\nthe King,' for his Ministers had to follow him into the camp and the\r\nhunting-field, and this prevented his Court becoming lapped in luxury.\r\nLarge tracts were preserved for him for ibex and moufflon on the\r\nmountains, and antelope on the plains, and the hawking of duck or\r\npartridge on by-days. This nomadic life, with its hunting habits,\r\nencouraged the pleasant, easy manner which attracted his subjects and\r\ncommanded their confidence. He was an energetic worker, and had full\r\nknowledge of all home and foreign affairs. He was superior to all palace\r\nintrigues, if any existed, and his Ministers were rarely changed. The\r\nlong continuance in office of his councillors added to the feeling of\r\npublic security which his own strong personality had given to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn appearance Nasr-ed-Din Shah was little changed since 1889, when his\r\nfigure was a well-known one in Europe. He showed the same alertness of\r\nstep, brightness of look and manner, and smartness of dress, which\r\ndistinguished him then. In his Court he was a striking figure, in marked\r\ncontrast to those about him, for it must be confessed that all in\r\nattendance showed some neglect of appearance which compared unfavourably\r\nwith the _tout ensemble_ of their Sovereign. This may possibly have been\r\na subtle form of flattery, so that the Shah alone might catch the eye\r\nand be the 'observed of all observers'--'le Roi-Soleil'--of the land of\r\nthe Lion and the Sun.\r\n\r\nNo one probably saw more clearly than the Shah that the system of\r\nfarming out the administration of the provinces from year to year is\r\nbad, both for the Treasury and the people; but he knew well that reform,\r\nto be sure and certain, must be slow and gradual, for change in Persia,\r\nwith its ancient traditions and old memories, cannot be effected at one\r\nstroke. He had done much to mitigate the evil of the present system by\r\nestablishing telegraphic communication with all the centres of\r\nprovincial government, thus placing himself in close touch with his\r\nsubjects, even in the most remote parts. Gradually the confidence which\r\nbegan in his near neighbourhood had extended throughout the country, and\r\nthere was a firm belief in the minds of the people that the Shah could\r\nbe approached by all. But it can well be imagined that it takes a\r\ndesperate case to induce those who are oppressed in distant places to\r\nhave recourse to such a public mode of communicating grievances as the\r\ntelegraph. Yet the telegraph is so employed at times, the senders of the\r\ntelegrams giving their names openly, and confidently awaiting the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe Persian Telegraph Department has a peculiar importance in being the\r\nsecret agency by which the Shah is served with an independent and\r\nreliable daily report of all that goes on throughout the country. The\r\nsystem of direct reports of the conduct of governors, by special\r\nresident officials, which was established in the days of Darius the\r\nKing, has developed into the present secret service daily telegrams.\r\nNominations to all the telegraph appointments are made by the Minister\r\nin charge of the department, who bears the appropriate title of\r\nMukbir-i-Dowleh (Intelligencer of the State).\r\n\r\nAn instance of the power exercised through this system occurred within\r\nmy personal knowledge a few years ago. A local dignitary in a distant\r\nprovince fell under the frown of the Prince Governor, who, actuated by\r\ngreed, imposed on him a heavy fine for an imaginary offence. The fine\r\nwas not paid, on which a charge of contumacy was made, and this was\r\npunished by the cruel bastinado and imprisonment. The Telegraph-master,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact of the Governor being a near relative of the\r\nlate Shah, reported the circumstance in all its details. The telegraph\r\nenabled the Shah to make his presence felt in distant places, as well as\r\nhis power, for he was in the habit of occasionally summoning a Governor\r\nto the office at the other end of the wire, to hear his commands spoken\r\non the spot. In this instance the Shah, after personal inquiry, ordered\r\nthe release of the prisoner, and on being informed some days later that\r\nthis had not been done, the Telegraph-master was directed to take the\r\ntelegraphic royal command to the prison, and see it instantly obeyed.\r\nThe official carried out his instructions, and the guards at once set\r\nthe prisoner free.\r\n\r\nThe system of farming out the provinces gives rise to much grumbling,\r\nwhich perhaps, on close examination, may be found to be without full\r\nreason. The real cause of complaint is the absence of fair fixed\r\ntaxation demands. Every village has to pay a tithe of its annual value\r\nto the State, and previous to collection the place is visited by one of\r\nthe provincial officials, and the fullest details of the circumstances\r\nof each family are ascertained. The limit of the official robbery which\r\nfollows is the ability to pay, as measured by the patience of the\r\nsufferers. The peasantry are peaceful, frugal, and easily governed, but\r\nthere is a point beyond which they cannot be pressed without risk of\r\nmaking them turn on the oppressor. They have now learnt the strength of\r\nthe defence they possess in the power of making their grievances known.\r\nNo doubt the provincial levy of taxation charges doubles the State\r\ntithe, one-half of the whole amount being taken by the Governor and the\r\nofficials; but all this does not mean more than one-fifth of the village\r\nincome, for the general assessment was made before the existing\r\nimprovement in the circumstances of the cultivators had taken place more\r\nor less all over the country. There was then little demand for products\r\nwhich are now exported and paid for in gold, thus giving a high price in\r\nthe silver currency of the country. After the provincial taxation, there\r\nare local charges, which may possibly add a further 2 or 3 per cent, to\r\nthe total amount. Formerly insecurity and want of confidence confined\r\ncultivation and stock-breeding to the barest limits, but it is evident\r\nnow that the inhabitants can look to enjoy the fruits of their labour,\r\nand they are extending their fields of exertion. On the whole, it may be\r\nsaid that the peasantry and labouring classes in Persia are fairly well\r\noff, and I think their condition can bear a favourable comparison with\r\nthat of the same classes in other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my journeying in Persia, I generally found excellent\r\nquarters in the village houses. The rather mean outer appearance of the\r\ndwellings conveys the idea of poor accommodation within, but the reality\r\nis a pleasing disclosure of plain but well-carpeted rooms, with dados of\r\nmatting or felt for the backs of the sitters by the wall. I always\r\nlooked out for village lodgings when travelling off the main roads, and\r\nin wintry weather they were very comfortable from their open well-built\r\nclay fireplaces giving out heat without the nuisance of smoke. On these\r\noccasions I had ample opportunity to observe the every-day life of the\r\npeople, and I was struck with much which showed that their manners and\r\nways had been favourably touched and turned by a softening civilization\r\nof old date. I also there saw clear evidence of the origin of the\r\nEastern shoe question, a matter which has often given rise to warm\r\ndiscussion in Persia and India; I allude to the removal of shoes on\r\nentering the inner rooms of a house. In India it is taken to imply\r\ninferiority, and since the establishment of British supremacy the custom\r\nhas never been complied with by a European except in cases of personal\r\nemployment in a native State. I remember an instance in point when a\r\nsergeant piper of a Highland regiment took service with one of the\r\nPunjab Sikh chiefs, to instruct a bagpipe band which the Rajah had\r\nformed in admiration of Scottish Highland music. In the contract paper\r\nwhich set forth in detail the duties, pay, and allowances of the\r\ninstructor, the sergeant expressly stipulated that he should not be\r\nrequired to remove his shoes on entering the Rajah's room when a\r\nEuropean was present. The origin of the custom of removing the shoes was\r\nclearly to avoid soiling the carpets in the house or tent, on which the\r\ninmates sat, ate, and slept.\r\n\r\nFelts and rush-mats, no doubt, formed the first floor-coverings for\r\ntents and houses; but as arts and manufactures grew in Central Asia, the\r\npastoral tribes, with whom, there being little or no agricultural work\r\nfor the women and children, the woollen industries began, introduced\r\ncarpets with coloured designs, many of the patterns of which are known\r\nto be of very old date, and still remain in the hands of certain\r\nfamilies as their own carefully-guarded secrets and property. These\r\ncarpets then became their pictures, framed in felt side-strips, on which\r\npeople sat, slept, and transacted business. At meals the centre is\r\ncovered with a cloth, on which the dishes are placed; and I think the\r\ncarpet is regarded similarly as a well-polished dining-table was in the\r\nWest in olden days, when the cloth was removed at the end of the\r\ncourses. At other times it may be supposed that the pretty carpets are\r\ntheir pictures on the floor, just as ours are on the wall; in fact, many\r\ncarpets of old design are so lovely and delicate that they are hung on\r\nthe walls of European residents' houses in Persia as being too good to\r\nbe trodden on. In the village houses the peasants always leave their\r\nshoes at the inner doors, and when a man arrives in riding-boots, with\r\nno intention of staying long, he complies with the object of the custom\r\nby sitting on the edge of the carpet, or felt, and tucking his legs\r\nunderneath him, so that the feet may not touch or soil it. In this there\r\nis no question of inferior and superior, for all are socially equal; it\r\nis merely a matter of good manners and friendly feeling, just as\r\nsignified in the West by removal of the hat or cap. It would appear that\r\nin the reception of Western Envoys at the Court of Persia it was\r\ncustomary to change the boots or shoes for slippers, or to cover them\r\nwith these; but the practice was generally regarded as derogatory to\r\nthe dignity of the national representative, and sometimes became the\r\nsubject of strong protest and resentment. There is reason to believe\r\nthat the custom always cropped up with every Envoy as an annoying cause\r\nof heated discussion and disagreeable feeling. On the occasion of the\r\nreception of Mr. Anthony Jenkinson, Queen Elizabeth's Envoy at the Court\r\nof Persia in 1561, this shoe question assumed an acute form; and when a\r\npair of the Shah's slippers was sent to him to be worn at the interview\r\nwith his Majesty, it is said that what was meant as attention was taken\r\nfor insult. The interview took place without the slippers being used,\r\nand the meeting was not of a cordial character.\r\n\r\nBut besides this shoe difficulty at the Court of Persia, there was also\r\na divergence of opinion regarding the lower garments, as the tight\r\nknee-breeches and hose of the West were considered improper in the East,\r\nand it is believed that the roomy Turkish _shâlwâr_ trousers were\r\nrequired to be worn as 'overalls' to hide the legs on occasions of royal\r\naudience. In connection with this phase of Eastern idea, an incident\r\nhappened with Sir Douglas Forsyth's diplomatic mission to the Amir of\r\nKashgar in 1873-74, which is worth mentioning here. The camp-sergeant\r\nwith the mission was Sergeant Rhind, of the 92nd Highlanders, and on the\r\nEnvoy and staff being received at Yarkand by the Governor of that\r\nprovince, the second highest dignitary in the kingdom, it was understood\r\nthat, as he was most exacting in the full observance of all formalities,\r\nmuch would depend upon his report of our demeanour, appearance, and\r\ngeneral conduct. This Governor kept quite a little Court, and we\r\naccordingly paid our visit in all the show of a dress parade. Sergeant\r\nRhind attended in kilted uniform, and his appearance attracted\r\nconsiderable shy and sly notice. Mahomed Yunis, the Governor, was a man\r\nof severe ideas, and while pretending not to see the Highlander, who\r\nstood behind us during the interview, he was reported to say after our\r\ndeparture that his costume appeared to be incomplete. Some weeks\r\nafterwards, on our reaching Kashgar, the capital in the North, and\r\npreparing for the formal audience of the Sovereign, the famous Ataligh\r\nGhazi, the Court master of the ceremonies, appeared suddenly before the\r\nappointed time, and announced most peremptorily that the sergeant was to\r\naccompany us fully dressed. He explained that the kilt with bare knees\r\nwas objectionable, and could not be tolerated at the Ataligh's Court; so\r\nthe trews had to be substituted for the showy garb of old Gaul. The\r\nindoor dress worn by Persian ladies is not unlike our Highland kilt.\r\n\r\nThe shoe question was finally settled in a clause of the Turkmanchai\r\ntreaty of 1828, which is accepted by all the foreign legations. It\r\nprovides that goloshes or shoe-coverings shall be worn, to be removed\r\nbefore entering the audience-room or going into the Shah's presence, and\r\nthis practice continues at the present time. The 'dragoman'\r\nestablishments are much more attached to old ideas than Turks and\r\nPersians, and they cling to their presumed monopoly of knowledge of all\r\nCourt and social customs in order to enhance their importance. The\r\nPersians move with the times, and understand Western modes of showing\r\nrespect; yet I heard it said by a local light that it was a breach of\r\ngood taste to salute the Shah by lifting the hat, and that it offended\r\nMohammedan notions of propriety to remove the head-covering in society.\r\nAccordingly, I once saw some European gentlemen wearing their hats in\r\nthe reception-room of one of the Shah's Ministers; but on observing\r\nothers who were known to be well acquainted with Persian feeling\r\nentering with hat in hand, they, who were under the guidance of a\r\n'dragoman', adopted the European custom. In Fraser's 'Persia', we are\r\ntold that when Shah Abbas the Great received Sir Dodmore Cotton,\r\nAmbassador from James I., his Majesty, 'being desirous of pleasing his\r\nguests, drank to the health of the King of England. At the name of his\r\nSovereign the Ambassador stood up and took off his hat. Abbas smiled,\r\nand likewise raised his turban in token of respect.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIAN LADY AT HOME.]\r\n\r\nThe farming system which is applied to the Customs in Persia continues\r\nto cause considerable loss to the State. An extension of the same direct\r\ncontrol as is exercised in the Telegraph Department would show most\r\nfavourable results. Under the present short-sighted system the interests\r\nof all the contractors lie in suppressing correct information and giving\r\nmisleading statistics, so that the annual bidding may be kept low. But\r\nnotwithstanding this, the truth leaks out to indicate that trade in\r\nPersia is increasing. There are now signs of practical advice at\r\nTehran, to consider the establishment of a properly constituted Persian\r\ncontrol Board of Customs, by which a well-organized service, under the\r\ncentral authority, may be maintained, and a considerable increase of\r\nrevenue secured. It may be said that all merchants in Persia benefit by\r\nthe farming system, for under it they can arrange to have their goods\r\npassed on payment of a lump sum, and with but the merest show of\r\nexamination of invoices. In this manner they manage to get consignments\r\nthrough the Customs at less than the fixed tariff. On a late rumour of a\r\nforeign control of the Customs being likely, the Russian Armenian\r\nmerchants engaged in trade in the North frankly represented the fact of\r\narrangements being made with the authorities at the ports, to take less\r\nthan the treaty 5 per cent. on exports and imports, and they urged that\r\nthe custom was of such old date and long continuance as to make it a\r\nfully recognised right. They stated that their trade was established on\r\nthis basis, and they protested against any change. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the same custom prevails in the South, and all along the frontier.\r\nAs the farming contracts are much subdivided, competition operates to\r\nreduce rates, so as to induce change of trade routes. Thus, I heard of a\r\nmerchant in Central Persia, whose communications are with the South,\r\nasking a contractor in the North for a quotation of his terms, so as to\r\nmake it advantageous for him to send his goods that way. In the matter\r\nof contraband articles, the farming system lends itself to encourage the\r\npassing of what the State forbids, as the middlemen and their servants\r\nare tempted to make as much money as possible during the short time of\r\ntheir annual contract engagements. In a country like Persia, where pride\r\nof arms prevails to keep up the habit of carrying them, there is a\r\nsteady demand for modern breech-loading rifles. The Government is alive\r\nto the necessity of preventing the importation of firearms, and from\r\ntime to time seizures are made of consignments smuggled under the guise\r\nof merchandise. With a large nomad and semi-nomad population of warlike\r\nand predatory instincts, almost every man of whom lays by money most\r\ndiligently, bit by bit, for the purchase of a breechloader and\r\ncartridges, it is obvious that the interests of Government call for the\r\nstrongest check to the foreign trade in arms; but it may be taken for\r\ngranted that so long as the Customs are farmed out on the present system\r\nthe supply will be passed in to meet the demand. The favourite weapon is\r\nthe Martini-Henry, and there are many thousands in the possession of the\r\nnomads and villagers. This rifle, as the Peabody-Martini, was first\r\nintroduced into the country during the late Turko-Russian War, when,\r\nbeing the Turkish army weapon, it fell by thousands into the hands of\r\nRussian soldiers, who sold them to the Persian sutlers and pedlars\r\nallowed to accompany the troops. The Persians had shown their usual\r\nenergy and enterprise abroad by becoming camp-traders with the Russian\r\nforces engaged on active service in Asia Minor, and they sent the\r\ncaptured arms, which they purchased in large numbers, over the border\r\ninto Persia, where they fetched good prices. A profitable trade in\r\ncartridges followed the introduction of the new rifle, and judging by\r\nthe well-filled belts and bandoliers which I saw on the North-western\r\nfrontier (Kurdistan and Azerbaijan), the business appears to be a well\r\nestablished one. In the course of time and trade this rifle found its\r\nway South to the fighting Bakhtiaris, Lurs, and Arabs, and the general\r\nvote in its favour brought about a supply of 'trade' Martini-Henry arms\r\nimported by way of the Persian Gulf, so that now in Persia what is known\r\nas the 'Marteen' has become the popular arm in private possession. The\r\n'Remington' has its possessors and admirers among the Karun Arab tribes,\r\nwho get their arms from Baghdad and Turkish sources. There is a brisk\r\ntrade in ammunition for the breechloader, and so keen is the desire to\r\nsecure and supplement the supply that solid-drawn brass cartridge-cases,\r\nwhich admit of being used over and over again, with boxes of caps and\r\nsets of reloading apparatus, are now in brisk demand.\r\n\r\nAt Kasvin our eyes were refreshed with the sight of the\r\nexcellently-equipped Indo-European telegraph line, which comes in there\r\nfrom Tabriz and the North, and passes on to Tehran and India. This line,\r\nwith its wires carried on tall iron standard posts stretching far in a\r\ndominating manner over the country, seems to stand forth as a strong\r\nwitness to the effectual command and control exercised by the Shah's\r\nGovernment at the present time. On the first establishment of this line\r\nthere was much conjecture as to the great risk of continued interruption\r\nfrom the mischief of man; and failure to complete the land working at\r\nthe outset dissatisfied commercial men in England, so that to maintain\r\ncertain communication the Red Sea cable was laid. But new land lines\r\nwere erected which worked equally well as the cable, and the firm\r\ninsistence by the Persian Government on heavy damages for all malicious\r\ninjury gradually developed the perfect security which comes from local\r\ninterests demanding the fullest protection. The service by this line is\r\nnow as certain and quick as that of the ocean cable; in fact, I think\r\nthe average speed of messages between London and Calcutta is greater\r\n_viâ_ Tehran than _viâ_ Suez. There was an interesting race last year\r\nbetween the companies to communicate to India the result of the Derby,\r\nand it was won in a way by the cable line. The messages were\r\nsimultaneously despatched from Epsom, that by Tehran reaching Bombay\r\nfive seconds before the other, but as the name of the winning horse only\r\nwas given correctly, Karachi, six hundred miles distant, had to be\r\nasked for a repetition of the names of the second and third horses. The\r\ncable telegram gave the three names accurately. Had Karachi been agreed\r\nupon as the point of arrival for India, instead of Bombay, the\r\nIndo-European would have won this telegraph race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n--Kasvin grapes\r\n--Persian wine\r\n--Vineyards in Persia\r\n--Wine manufacture\r\n--Mount Demavend\r\n--Afshar volcanic region\r\n--Quicksilver and gold\r\n--Tehran water-supply\r\n--Village quarrels\r\n--Vendetta\r\n--Tehran tramways\r\n--Bread riots\r\n--Mint and copper coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grape harvest was being gathered at Kasvin as we passed through. The\r\nplace is well known for its extensive vineyards and fine fruit-gardens.\r\nIts golden grapes have a wide reputation, and these, with the white\r\nspecies, also grown there, are in steady demand for wine manufacture,\r\nwhich is carried on in the town, notwithstanding the greatly\r\ndisproportionate number of Moullas among the inhabitants. Large\r\nquantities of the grapes are also sent to Tehran for wine purposes\r\nthere. Persia keeps up the character for strong wine which it had 600\r\nB.C., when the Scythian invaders took to it so eagerly as to establish\r\nthe saying, 'As drunk as a Scythian.' It was said that these\r\nhard-headed, deep-drinking, wild warriors were always thirsting for\r\n'another skinful,' and were ever ready to declare that the last was\r\nalways the best. Eighteen hundred years later, Hafiz, the merry poet,\r\nsang aloud the praises of Shiraz wine, which to this day bears a high\r\nreputation in Persia, a reputation which was royally good in the\r\ntraditional bygone time long before Cyrus, when it appears to have been\r\nhighly appreciated in the festivities of Glorious Jamshed, the founder\r\nof Persepolis. The poet Omar Khayyam, in moralizing over the ruins of\r\nthe fallen splendour of that famous place, speaks in Fitzgerald's\r\n'Rubaiyat':\r\n\r\n  'They say the lion and the lizard keep\r\n   The Court where Jamshed gloried and drank deep.'\r\n\r\nThe Persian poet-historian Firdausi ascribes to Jamshed the discovery of\r\nwine in his leisure from kingly duties and scientific pursuits, for to\r\nhim is attributed the invention of many useful arts, and the\r\nintroduction of the solar year for measurement of time, the first day of\r\nwhich, when the sun enters Aries, he ordered to be celebrated by a\r\nsplendid festival. It is called Nauroz, or New Year's Day, and is still\r\nthe greatest festival in Persia. This single institution of former days,\r\nunder a different religion and system of measuring time, has triumphed\r\nover the introduction of Mohammedanism, and is observed with as much joy\r\nand festivity now as it was by the ancient inhabitants of Persia.\r\n\r\nAccording to Moulla Akbar's manuscripts, quoted in Malcolm's 'History of\r\nPersia,' Jamshed was immoderately fond of grapes, and desired to\r\npreserve some which were placed in a large vessel and lodged in a vault\r\nfor future use. When the vessel was opened, the grapes had fermented,\r\nand their juice in this state was so acid that the King believed it must\r\nbe poisonous. He had some other vessels filled with the juice, and\r\n'Poison' written upon each; these were placed in his room. It happened\r\nthat one of his favourite ladies was afflicted with nervous headaches,\r\nthe pain of which distracted her so much that she desired death, and\r\nobserving a vessel with 'Poison' written on it, she took it and\r\nswallowed its contents. The wine, for such it had become, overpowered\r\nthe lady, who fell down in a sound sleep, and awoke much refreshed.\r\nDelighted with the remedy, she repeated the doses so often that the\r\nKing's 'poison' was all drunk. He soon discovered this, and forced the\r\nlady to confess what she had done. A quantity of wine was then made, and\r\nJamshed and all his Court drank of the new beverage, which, from the\r\ncircumstance that led to its discovery, is to this day known in Persia\r\nas _zahr-i-khûsh_, or the pleasing poison. After that the manufacture of\r\nwine became a regular industry, and spread from Shiraz, where it\r\noriginated. At the present time the process of manufacture is similar to\r\nwhat it was then, in that the grape-juice is collected in large\r\nAli-Baba-like jars and buried in the ground. Alexander the Great is said\r\nto have followed the festive example of his royal predecessor, and to\r\nhave drunk deep in the majestic halls of Persepolis. It has been\r\nsupposed by some that he caused the splendid palaces there to be set on\r\nfire in a drunken freak.\r\n\r\nAs a pendant to the story of a lady's discovery, in the time of Jamshed,\r\nof wine as an efficacious cure for nervous headache, another is told\r\nwhich ascribes to a lady the withdrawal of a royal decree against the\r\nsale and use of wine. The Shah Hussein, on his accession to the throne\r\nin 1694, displayed his religious zeal by forbidding the sale of wine,\r\nand he ordered the destruction of all the stock of it that was in the\r\nroyal cellars at Ispahan. But his grandmother, by feigning herself ill,\r\nand wholly dependent upon wine for cure, not only prevailed upon him to\r\nrevoke the decree, but also persuaded him to drink some in pure regard\r\nto herself, with the result that he fell away from priestly influence\r\nand became a tippler. Unfortunately for the nation, this grandmother's\r\nguidance led Shah Hussein to ruin by wine and women, and dragged him\r\ndown to the deep degradation of surrendering Persia to the cruel tyranny\r\nof the Afghan occupation.\r\n\r\nWood being scarce in Persia, and poles, stakes, and sticks for upright\r\nand lateral support not being easily procurable, the mode of culture of\r\nthe vine has come to be by planting in deep broad trenches, with high\r\nsloping banks, up and over which the stems and branches run and fall.\r\nThe trenches are made to lie so as to allow of the bank-slopes having\r\nthe best exposure. This is the system followed on the flat, but in hilly\r\nground, by means of careful trimming and the assistance of piled stones,\r\nthe plants are made to develop strong standard stems, with bunchy,\r\nbushy tops. I was particularly struck a few years ago with the neat,\r\nwell-tended vineyards at the village of Imâm-Zadeh-Ismail, in the hills\r\nabout forty miles north-west of Persepolis. Almost the whole of the\r\nvillage lands were laid out in vineyards, well walled and beautifully\r\nkept. The vines looked as if they were tended by those who understood\r\ntheir culture well, and they appeared to thrive wonderfully on the light\r\nsoil of the place. Surprising energy had been shown in clearing the\r\nground, which was naturally stony; and there was abundant evidence of\r\nmuch patient labour in the garden-like enclosures. Vineyards occupied\r\nall the flat ground on which the village stood, and they extended up the\r\nslopes. Hillside clearing was going on all around for further planting\r\nof vines, which were seen to flourish there. Raisins are largely made\r\nthere, and I was told by my Kashkai conductor (for I was well off the\r\nbeaten track and required a guide), who seemed to know what he was\r\ntalking about, that the fresh grapes were used for wine, but not in the\r\nvillage. The religious character of the chief inhabitants of the\r\nvillage, who are sheikhs, and guardians of the Holy Shrine of the\r\nmausoleum of the Imam-Zadeh-Ismail, which lies within its limits,\r\nprevents the preparation there of the forbidden fermented juice of the\r\ngrape. The shrine is endowed with the village lands rent free, and all\r\nthese lands are devoted to vine cultivation. The vineyards at Shiraz\r\nhave been greatly extended of late years, and particular attention is\r\nnow paid to the cultivation of the Kholar grape, as the best suited for\r\nwine. This grape takes its name from the village of Kholar, which is\r\nwithin a few miles of the town. Tabriz, Hamadan, Isfahan, and Shiraz\r\nproduce the best wine in Persia. Red and white are made at all these\r\nplaces; the white wine of Hamadan is a sort of strong sauterne, and some\r\nof it has quite a delicate flavour; Isfahan produces a wine of a port\r\ncharacter, and the best shiraz is sometimes like new madeira. All these\r\nwines resemble in strength those that are now made in Australia.\r\nSomething is wanting in the mode of manufacture to make the wine capable\r\nof improvement with keeping, and also of bearing transport. The advent\r\nof the Russian road will probably lead to the development of Kasvin's\r\nlarge area of fruitful vines, and the success which has attended\r\nvineyard industry at Derbend, on the Caspian, may encourage similar\r\nenterprise there.\r\n\r\nAs neither law nor custom forbids the manufacture of wine by\r\nnon-Mohammedans, the cultivation of the grape spreads, and the making of\r\nwine increases. From this it may be inferred, as there is little export\r\nof wine from Persia, that all the produce is not consumed by\r\nnon-Mohammedans. As a matter of fact, the religious law which forbids\r\nwine to Mohammedans is not rigidly observed; in truth, they are not all\r\ntotal abstainers, and the delightful poison, as chronicled by Moulla\r\nAkbar, is known to be a convenient remedy for all manner of moods, ills,\r\nand complaints, nervous, imaginary, and real. They have been described\r\nas drinking well when they do break the religious law, for they have a\r\nsaying that 'there is as much sin in a glass as in a flagon.' The\r\nPersians have never thoroughly accommodated themselves to the creed of\r\ntheir Semitic conquerors; they show profound respect for the externals\r\nof Mohammedanism, and are sincere in their practice of piety and the\r\nobligations of religion and charity; but they have always indulged in\r\nthe fancies and ideas of the great school of free-thinking philosopher\r\nSofis, whose observance of the ordinances of severe and joyless life is\r\nnotedly lax.\r\n\r\nThe weather was lovely as we journeyed over the Kasvin plain to Tehran,\r\ntowards the end of September. Autumn in the North of Persia is a\r\ngloriously fine season, almost spring-like in many ways, and, indeed, it\r\nis called there the 'second spring.' The landscape then, though nearly\r\nbarren of verdure, has a beauty of its own in warm soft colours, and the\r\natmospheric effects on the hills and distances, evening and morning, are\r\nof wonderfully delicate tones and tints. The prominent feature in the\r\nlandscape near Tehran is the grand cone-shaped Mount Demavend, about\r\nforty miles to the north-east, which shoots up 19,400 feet above\r\nocean-level, and overtops all the surrounding heights by 6,000 feet or\r\nmore. It stood out bold, cold, and clear against the blue sky, and\r\nlooked beautifully white with a fresh covering of new snow, and it was\r\nmore than usually distinct, from being clear of the cloud-crown it\r\nusually wears. In the evening the massive peak presented a splendid\r\nappearance, looking as in a white heat from the shine of the setting\r\nsun, which, though lost to view below the horizon, yet lighted up the\r\nold volcano.\r\n\r\nDemavend has long been asleep, but the great earthquakes of 1891, 1893\r\nand 1895 in Astrabad and Kuchan to the eastward, and Khalkhal in the\r\nnorth-west, show that its underground fires are still alight. The scene\r\nof the last is about one hundred miles north-east of the old volcanic\r\nregion of Afshar, remarkable for its remains of vast 'cinter' cones,\r\nformed by the flowing geysers of long, long ago, and which were\r\nshattered and scattered by some mighty explosion, when the great geysers\r\nboiled up and burst their walls. Here is seen the Takht-i-Sulimân, a\r\nruined fort of very ancient date, which local tradition describes as one\r\nof King Solomon's royal residences, shared by his Queen, Belghéiz (of\r\nSheba), whose summer throne is also shown on a mountain height above.\r\nThis ruin incloses a flowing geyser of tepid sea-green water, about 170\r\nfeet deep, the temperature of which was 66° when I visited the place in\r\n1892. Near it is the Zindân-i-Sulimân (Solomon's Dungeon), an extinct\r\ngeyser, 350 feet deep. It shows as a massive 'cinter' cone, 440 feet\r\nhigh, standing prominently up in the plain. This district was visited\r\nand fully described by the late Sir Henry Rawlinson, and a further\r\naccount of it has been given by Mr. Theodore Bent, who, with Mrs. Bent,\r\nwent there in 1889.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic district of Afshar has long been known for its quicksilver,\r\nwhich from time to time has been found in small quantities. Some seven\r\nor eight hundred years ago Arab miners laboured long in their search for\r\nthe main cinnabar vein which undoubtedly lies hidden there, and their\r\nwide workings in laying open a whole hillside, where signs of cinnabar\r\nare still seen, show what great gangs of labourers they must have had at\r\ntheir command. The Persian Mines Corporation in 1891-92 engaged in\r\noperations at the same point, but, after considerable sinking of shafts\r\nand driving of galleries into the heart of the hill, they decided to\r\ncease work, being disappointed, like their Arab predecessors, in not\r\nfinding quickly what they had traced by clear signs up to its mountain\r\nsource. A few miles below the site of these cinnabar-mine operations\r\nthere are ancient gold-washing workings, and within thirty miles are\r\nheavy veins of quartz.\r\n\r\nTehran displays a marked advance in many of the resources of\r\ncivilization; houses of an improved style are springing up, the roadways\r\nare better attended to, and there is a great increase in the number of\r\ncarriages. The Prime Minister's new house, near the British Legation, is\r\nsituated in beautiful gardens, set off with pretty lakelets and terraced\r\ngrounds, which give slopes for flowing waterfalls. These gardens, in\r\ncommon with all in the town, are tenanted every year by nightingales of\r\nsweet song. It is now proposed to enclose an adjoining available space\r\nto form a people's park, which would be a great place of enjoyment in\r\nsummer to a people of poetic imagination like the Persians, who delight\r\nin the green glade with the cool sound of flowing water. The severe\r\ncholera epidemic of 1892 showed the absolute necessity of an improvement\r\nin the rude sanitary system which then existed, and a beginning has been\r\nmade in the daily careful cleaning of the streets and removal of refuse.\r\nBut a better and increased water-supply is greatly needed for the town,\r\nwhich is becoming larger every year. People who have money to spend\r\nappear to be attracted more than ever to the capital. Those who before\r\nwere content with the provincial towns now build houses in Tehran. The\r\nsuperior houses have garden-ground attached, and much tree-planting is\r\ndone. The demand for water increases, but the supply is not\r\nsupplemented. Years ago the utmost was made of the sources from which\r\nwater is drawn; no pains have been spared to extract every possible drop\r\nof water from the heart of the hills within a considerable distance, and\r\nto convey it undiminished by evaporation to the city. This is done by\r\nunderground channels called _kanats_, which are excavated with great\r\ningenuity and skill, and are marvels of industry. This system prevails\r\nall over Persia, and existence as well as the fertility of the soil\r\nmainly depends on the water-supply thus obtained. The sandy expanse\r\nround Yezd in the desert of South-eastern Persia has been made literally\r\nto blossom like the rose by means of these subterranean channels, some\r\nof which are tunnelled for a distance of thirty miles. I was there in\r\nspring-time, and was then able to see what a wonder-worker water is in\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nThe pressing need of more water for Tehran has now drawn attention to\r\nthe proposals of some years ago for increasing the supply. One of these\r\nwas to divert to the south an affluent of the Upper Lar, which rises in\r\nthe Elburz range, and flows into the Caspian. It was seen that this\r\ncould be done by cutting a new channel and tunnelling from a point\r\nsufficiently high, where the stream runs in an elevated valley between\r\nthe double ridge of the range. The work would have been similar, but\r\nsimpler, to what was completed last year in Madras, where the upper\r\nPeriyar stream was changed from a western to an eastern flow. The\r\nexecution of the Lar project would be easy, and it would not practically\r\naffect the volume of water in the main stream, which receives many\r\ntributaries below the proposed point of piercing the watershed. But the\r\nLar Valley was one of the Shah's summer retreats, and a favourite\r\npasture-ground for his brood mares and young stock. It is, moreover, a\r\npopular resort of flock-owning nomads, and as the Shah's love of camp\r\nlife there led him to fear injury to the grassy plains and slopes of\r\nhis favourite highlands, the project was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere was another scheme to construct a series of reservoirs by means of\r\nstrong barriers at the foot of the lower ravines of the Elburz range,\r\neight miles north of Tehran, in which to keep the winter water which\r\ncomes from the melting snow. The whole mountain-chain is covered with\r\nsnow each year from top to bottom. In April and May the snow melts, and\r\nthe precious water flows away where it is not wanted. Were this water\r\nstored, it would be made available in the succeeding hot months. The\r\nsloping plain between the hills and the town is capable, with\r\nirrigation, of great fertility, and the construction of these reservoirs\r\nwould prove a veritable gold-mine.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of water is a most important part of village\r\nadministration in Persia. The work of cutting off and letting on water\r\nwith most exact observance of time-measurements is carried out by a\r\nwaterman called _mirab_ (lord of the water) whose office is hereditary,\r\nsubject, however, to the special judgment of popular opinion. The duties\r\ndemand a clear head and nimble foot, and the waterman, in hastening\r\nfrom point to point, has to show all the alertness of a street\r\nlamplighter. He has to keep a correct count of time, for water is\r\napportioned by the hour, and his memory for all the details of change,\r\nsale, and transfer must be good and unchallenged. When he becomes too\r\nold, or otherwise incapacitated for the performance of his work with the\r\nnecessary quickness, he avails himself of the assistance of a son or\r\nsomeone whom he proposes with the village approval to bring up as his\r\nsuccessor. The old man is then to be seen going leisurely along the\r\nwater-courses which issue from the underground channels, accompanied by\r\nhis young deputy carrying the long-handled Persian spade, ready to run\r\nand execute his orders. Disputes between village and village over\r\n_kanat_ water-cuts form the subject of severe fights occasionally, and\r\nthe saying is that water and women are the main causes of village\r\nquarrels in Persia.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot day in June, and having been up before daylight so as to\r\nstart at earliest dawn and avoid the mid-day heat for my whole party, we\r\nwere all in the enjoyment of afternoon sleep, when the courtyard was\r\ninvaded by a shouting mob of excited villagers, calling on me to hear\r\ntheir story and bear witness to their wounds. They said they were the\r\ntenants of the landlord whose house I was occupying, and they begged me\r\nas his guest to make a statement of their case, so that justice might be\r\ndone. There had been a dispute over an irrigation channel, and the\r\nopposing side having mustered strong, they were overpowered by numbers\r\nand badly beaten. Some of the hurts they had received were ugly to look\r\nat, having been inflicted with the long-handled Persian spade, the\r\nfoot-flanges of which make it a dangerous weapon. After a patient\r\nhearing, and getting some plaster and simple dressing for their cuts and\r\nbruises, they went away satisfied. So much for water as a cause of\r\nquarrel, but an instance of the other cause, woman, which had come under\r\nmy notice shortly before, was more seriously characteristic. It occurred\r\nat Shamsabad, on the border of the Aberkoh Desert, between Yezd and\r\nShiraz. I halted there after the long night journey across the desert,\r\nand immediately I was settled in my village quarters, the master of the\r\nhouse in which I lodged asked me to look at the gunshot wounds of one\r\nof his young men, and to prescribe and provide in any way I could\r\ntowards healing them. I asked if any bones were broken, saying that I\r\ncould do little or nothing in such a case. I was told that they were but\r\nflesh wounds, and on the young man coming in, I was shown a ragged long\r\ncut between the lower ribs, and a deepish wound in the fleshy part of\r\nthe leg, which had evidently been made by slugs or buckshot. I\r\nprescribed careful cleansing, and the use of lint and lotion, and I gave\r\na supply of the necessary material. I asked how the thing had happened,\r\nand the young fellow told me that he and his brother had been\r\ntreacherously attacked at a water-mill, whilst having the family grain\r\nground, by some Aberkoh youths, between whose family and his there was a\r\nlongstanding blood-feud; that they both had been shot at close quarters,\r\nand his brother had died of his wounds two days before.\r\n\r\nThe master of the house, who was also headman of the village, explained\r\nthat the blood-feud had been carried on for five generations, and had\r\noriginated in a 'little maid' who, being betrothed in their village, had\r\neloped with a young man of Aberkoh. The disappointed bridegroom had\r\nafterwards taken his successful rival's life, and the deadly demand of a\r\nlife for a life had, in accordance with the law of revenge, been made\r\nand exacted for the past five generations. He said the elders had hoped\r\nthe quarrel was nearly dead, as there had been long peace between the\r\nparties, but suddenly the hot blood of youth had risen to renew it, and\r\nnow there was fear of further murder. In that remote district the\r\nancient first principles of natural justice had still strong hold upon\r\nthe people, and formed, in the absence of established law, the defence\r\nof families and communities.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that a man is considered disgraced who allows the blood of\r\nhis father or brother to pass unrevenged makes many a murderer in\r\nthought pause, and depart from the deed. Accordingly, in those lawless\r\nparts, as a rule, order reigns, and disputes and differences are\r\ndiscussed by the village 'gray-beards,' who generally are able to\r\narrange a compromise. But in the reckless rage of a lost love the deed\r\nis done, which carries its fatal consequences to future generations, as\r\nin the case I have mentioned. I told the old village headman, who was\r\nreally the local judge, that in some of the wild parts of Firanghistan\r\nthere were similar occurrences, and that the best form of reconciliation\r\nin the present instance would be 'wife for wife,' the first offending\r\nfamily giving a girl-love to a husband-lover on the other side, and thus\r\nfinally closing the quarrel in the happiest manner. I said that under\r\nsuch circumstances intermarriages were generally the best means of\r\nimproving friendship and terminating feuds between families.\r\n\r\nThe Tehran street tramways continue to work, though the profit return is\r\nsmall. The company began with graduated fares, but I heard they were\r\nconsidering a minimum general charge, which it was thought would\r\nencourage more traffic, especially in the visits of women to one\r\nanother, as their outdoor dress is unsuited to walking in comfort. The\r\ntramway cars have separate compartments for women. The travelling pace\r\nis necessarily slow, in order to avoid hurt or harm to people and\r\nanimals in the crowded thoroughfares. In the East, accidents at the\r\nhands of Europeans or their employés are not readily understood or\r\neasily accepted as such. The Tehran Tramways Company has had its trials\r\nin this respect. At one time it was the heavy hurt of a boy, son of a\r\nSyud, one of the 'pure lineage', a descendant of the family of the\r\nProphet, on which the populace, roused by the lashing lamentations of\r\nthe father, damaged the car and tore up the line. On another occasion a\r\nman, in obstinate disregard of warning, tried to enter at the front, and\r\nwas thrown under the wheels. Again the excitable bystanders were worked\r\nup to fury and violence, and the Governor of the town gave judgment\r\nagainst the company for 'blood-money'. The counter-claim for damage done\r\nto the line enabled a compromise to be effected. Oriental indifference\r\nis the chief cause of the accidents. 'It is impossible but that offences\r\nwill come, but woe unto him through whom they come.' For 'offences', the\r\nOriental reading is 'accidents'.\r\n\r\nIn all large Persian towns there is a numerous class of 'roughs' known\r\nas the _kullah-numdah_ (felt-caps; they wear a brown hard-felt low hat\r\nwithout a brim), excitable and reckless, and always ready for\r\ndisturbance. They are the 'casuals', who live from hand to mouth, those\r\nto whom an appeal can be made by the careful working class when the\r\nprice of bread is run up to famine figure, owing to the 'cornering' of\r\nwheat, which of late years has been much practised in Persia. The baker\r\nused to be the first victim of popular fury in a bread riot, and it is\r\nsaid that one was baked alive in his own oven. But in these times of\r\ngrain speculation in Persia, the people have learnt to look in 'wheat\r\ncorners' for the real cause of dear bread, and in consequence the bread\r\nriots have become more formidable, as was proved lately at Tabriz. On a\r\nprevious occasion the Vali Ahd (now H.I.M. the Shah), who, as\r\nGovernor-General of Azerbaijan, resided at Tabriz, found himself unable\r\nto cope with the difficulty, and abandoned his projected visit to\r\nTehran, so as to apply the money he had provided for it to cheapening\r\nbread for the people. This practical pocket-sympathy with them secured a\r\npopularity which will bring its reward.\r\n\r\nNext to the 'wheat-ring' as a cause of disturbance and riot comes what\r\nmay be called the 'copper-ring' of Tehran, which is likely to produce\r\nserious trouble throughout the country. The Royal Mint in Persia is\r\nworked on the farming system, the evils of which have now extended to\r\nthe currency. The low price of copper allows of it being coined at an\r\nenormous profit, and advantage has been taken of this to a dangerous\r\nextent. The whole country is now poisoned with 'black money,' as the\r\ncoppers are called, and it is at a heavy discount. This bears cruelly on\r\nthe labouring classes and all who are paid in copper coin. Owing to\r\nexchange with Europe keeping above silver, that metal cannot be imported\r\nand coined, so as to give a gain to the Mint-master, who has no idea of\r\nsacrificing any of the great profit he has made on copper. No silver has\r\nbeen coined since March, 1895, and this is the Mint-master's excuse for\r\nsending out copper in great quantities, to take the place of silver.\r\nTwenty copper shahi go to a kran (present exchange value 4-1/2d.), and\r\nin the absence of silver employers of labour pay wholly in copper, which\r\nfor bazaar purposes is at a discount, so much so that, when a purchase\r\nis beyond question above a kran in amount, an agreement as to payment in\r\nsilver or copper is first made, and then the bargaining begins. In a\r\ncountry where money bears a high value, as proved by the fact that\r\naccounts are still reckoned in dinars, an imaginary coin, of which one\r\nthousand go to a silver kran and fifty to a copper shahi, the\r\ndepreciation I have mentioned is a very serious affair, for it touches\r\nthe mass of the people sorely. When travelling off the beaten track in\r\nPersia, I have always been amused and interested in hearing my\r\nhead-servant announce loudly in a tone of importance and satisfaction to\r\nmy village host for the night that I had ordered so many 'thousands' to\r\nbe given for house-room, fuel, barley, straw, etc. The kran was never\r\nmentioned; it was always a 'thousand.'[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A: Since the above was written, information has been received\r\nthat the late Shah, about three weeks before his death, promulgated a\r\ndecree directing the Mint coinage of copper to be suspended for a term\r\nof five years, and intimating that the Customs, Post-office and\r\nTelegraph departments would accept copper coin to a certain amount in\r\ncash transactions, at a fixed rate. And, further, arrangements have been\r\nmade with the Imperial Bank of Persia to purchase, on account of the\r\nGovernment, copper coin up to a certain sum, from small _bona-fide_\r\nholders who are in possession of it in the regular course of retail\r\nbusiness for the necessaries of life.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n--Religious tolerance in Tehran\r\n--Katie Greenfield's case\r\n--Babi sect\r\n--Liberal opinions\r\n--German enterprise in Persia\r\n--Railways in Asia Minor\r\n--Russian road extension\r\n--Railways to Persian frontiers\r\n--The Karun River\r\n--Trade development\r\n--The Kajar dynasty\r\n--Life titles\r\n--Chieftainship of tribes\r\n--Sanctuary\r\n--The Pearl cannon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Shah was always liberal and conciliatory in the treatment of\r\nhis Christian subjects throughout the country, and this is a matter\r\nwhich, at the present time, deserves special notice. In the history of\r\nPersia many proofs of friendly feeling towards Christians are to be\r\nfound, and the sovereigns appear to have led the popular mind in the way\r\nof goodwill to them. Shah Abbas the Great was an example of kind and\r\nconsiderate tolerance, and it was Shah Abbas II who said of them, 'It is\r\nfor God, not for me to judge of men's consciences: and I will never\r\ninterfere with what belongs to the tribunal of the Great Creator and\r\nLord of the universe.' The Western Christian missionaries are fully\r\nprotected in their mission work among the Eastern Christians in Persia\r\non the understanding that they do not actively and directly engage in\r\nproselytizing Mohammedans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMENIAN MOTHER AND CHILDREN]\r\n\r\nThe American Presbyterian is the only mission in Tehran, and it carries\r\non its work so smoothly and judiciously that the sensitive\r\nsusceptibilities of the most fanatical Moullas are never roused nor\r\nruffled. They have succeeded well by never attempting too much. They\r\nshow their desire to benefit all classes and creeds, and during the\r\nsevere cholera outbreak In 1892 the hospital they established in the\r\ncity for the medical treatment of all comers up to the utmost extent of\r\ntheir accommodation and ability was a powerful and convincing proof of\r\ntheir good work and will. The disease was of a very fatal type, and its\r\ndeadly ravages called forth a display of devotion and self-sacrifice\r\nwhich deserved and obtained the highest commendation from all Persians\r\nand Europeans.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, the splendid example set by the Governor of the\r\ntown, the Vazir Isa Khan, should be noticed. He was very wealthy, and\r\ndid much to relieve the sufferings and wants of the poor who were\r\nattacked by the disease. He remained in the city while the epidemic\r\nraged, and would not seek safety in flight to the adjoining mountains,\r\nas many had done. But, sad to say, he fell a victim at the last, and his\r\nwife, who had remained with him throughout, died of the disease two days\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in 1891 an agitation was raised regarding the\r\nreported abduction of an Armenian girl, named Katie Greenfield, by a\r\nKurd in Persian Kurdistan. An attempt which was made to take the girl\r\nback to her family caused the couple to cross the frontier into Turkish\r\nKurdistan, and great excitement among the Kurds on both sides of the\r\nborder was created. The contention grew, and commissioners and consuls,\r\nwith troops, Persian and Turkish, took part in it. In the end it was\r\nmade perfectly clear that the girl had gone off with Aziz, the Kurd, as\r\nthe husband of her own choice, and had embraced the Mohammedan faith by\r\nher own wish. The Kurds in Persian Kurdistan appear to live on friendly\r\nterms with their Armenian village neighbours, and on this occasion a\r\nrunaway love-match became the cause of some popular excitement in\r\nEngland, and much trouble and tumult on the Perso-Turkish frontier.\r\n\r\nThe Armenian Archbishop in Persia, who resides at Isfahan, is always a\r\nRussian subject from the monastery of Etchmiadzin, near Erivan, the seat\r\nof the Catholicus, the primate of the orthodox Armenian Church, and this\r\ndoubtless has its effect in suggesting protection and security. France\r\nalso for a longtime past has steadily asserted the right to protect the\r\nCatholic Armenian Church in Persia, and once a year the French Minister\r\nat Tehran, with the Legation secretaries, attends Divine service in the\r\nchapel there in full diplomatic dress and state, to show the fact and\r\nforce of the support which the Church enjoys. France similarly takes\r\nCatholic institutions in Turkey under her protection, and appears to be\r\ngenerally the Catholic champion in the East.\r\n\r\nThe careful observer in Tehran cannot fail to be struck with the\r\nreligious tolerance shown to non-Mohammedan Persian subjects in the\r\n'shadow of the Shah.' Amongst these, other than Christians, may be\r\nmentioned the Guebres (Parsees) and the Jews. Persecuted in the\r\nprovinces, they receive liberal treatment in Tehran, and it is to be\r\nhoped that the late Shah's gracious example will in time be followed by\r\nhis Majesty's provincial governors.\r\n\r\nThe Babi sect of Mohammedans, regarded as seceders from Islam, but who\r\nassert their claim to be only the advocates for Mohammedan Church\r\nreform, are at last better understood and more leniently\r\ntreated--certainly at Tehran. They have long been persecuted and\r\npunished in the cruellest fashion, even to torture and death, under the\r\nbelief that they were a dangerous body which aimed at the subversion of\r\nthe State as well as the Church. But better counsels now prevail, to\r\nshow that the time has come to cease from persecuting these sectarians,\r\nwho, at all events in the present day, show no hostility to the\r\nGovernment; and the Government has probably discovered the truth of the\r\nBabi saying, that one martyr makes many proselytes.\r\n\r\nThe Babis aim at attracting to their ranks the intelligent and the\r\nlearned, in preference to the ignorant and unlearned; and it is believed\r\nthat now sufficient education whereby to read and write is absolutely\r\nnecessary for membership. They wish to convince by example, and not by\r\nforce, and this accounts for the absence of active resistance to the\r\npersecutions from which they often suffer most grievously. They say that\r\nthey desire to return to original Mohammedanism, as it first came from\r\nthe Arabian desert, pure and simple, and free from the harsh intolerance\r\nand arrogance which killed the liberal spirit in which it was conceived.\r\nThey deplore the evil passions and fierce animosities engendered by\r\nreligious differences; they tolerate all creeds having a common end for\r\ngood, and seek to soften the hearts of those who persecute them, by\r\nshowing that they but wish for peace on earth and goodwill to all men.\r\nThey have a widespread organization throughout Persia, and many learned\r\nMoullas and Syuds have secretly joined them. They have always been firm\r\nin their faith, even unto death, rejecting the offer of life in return\r\nfor a declaration against the Bab, him whom they regard as the messenger\r\nof good tidings.\r\n\r\nAn acknowledged authority on the Bab, the founder of this creed, has\r\nwritten that he 'directed the thoughts and hopes of his disciples to\r\nthis world, not to an unseen world.' From this it was inferred he did\r\nnot believe in a future state, nor in anything beyond this life. Of\r\ncourse, among the followers of a new faith, liberal and broad in its\r\nviews, continued fresh developments of belief must be expected; and with\r\nreference to the idea that the Babis think not of a hereafter, I was\r\ntold that they believe in the re-incarnation of the soul, the good after\r\ndeath returning to life and happiness, the bad to unhappiness. A Babi,\r\nin speaking of individual pre-existence, said to me, 'You believe in a\r\nfuture state; why, then, should you not believe in a pre-existent state?\r\nEternity is without beginning and without end,' This idea of\r\nre-incarnation, generally affecting all Babis, is, of course, an\r\nextension of the original belief regarding the re-incarnation of the\r\nBab, and the eighteen disciple-prophets who compose the sacred college\r\nof the sect.\r\n\r\nSome time ago signs began to appear of a general feeling that the\r\npersecution of the Babis must cease. Many in high places see this, and\r\nprobably say it, and their sympathy becomes known. At one time a high\r\nMohammedan Church dignitary speaks regarding tolerance and progress in a\r\nmanner which seems to mean that he sees no great harm in the new sect.\r\nThen a soldier, high in power and trust, refers to the massacres of\r\nBabis in 1890 and 1891 as not only cruel acts, but as acts of insane\r\nfolly, 'for,' he said, 'to kill a Babi is like cutting down a\r\nchenar-tree, from the root of which many stems spring up, and one\r\nbecomes many.' Then a Moulla, speaking of the necessity of a more humane\r\ntreatment of the Babis, and others of adverse creeds, says that he looks\r\nfor the time when all conditions of men will be equally treated, and all\r\ncreeds and classes be alike before the law. Omar Khayyam, the\r\nastronomer-poet of Persia, who wrote about eight hundred years ago, gave\r\nopen expression to the same liberal-minded views, urging tolerance and\r\nfreedom for all religious creeds and classes.\r\n\r\nThe last murderous mob attack led by Moullas against the Babis occurred\r\nat Yezd in April, 1891. It was probably an outcome of the Babi massacre\r\nwhich had taken place at Isfahan the previous year, and which, owing to\r\nthe fiercely hostile attitude of the priests, was allowed to pass\r\nunnoticed by any strong public condemnation. On that occasion a party of\r\nthe sect, pursued by an excited and blood-thirsty mob, claimed the\r\n'sanctuary' of foreign protection in the office of the Indo-European\r\nTelegraph Company, and found asylum there. Negotiations were opened with\r\nthe Governor of the town, who arranged for a safe conduct to their homes\r\nunder military escort. Trusting to this, the refugees quitted the\r\ntelegraph-office, but had not proceeded far before they were beset by a\r\nfurious crowd, and as the escort offered no effectual resistance, the\r\nunfortunates were murdered in an atrociously cruel manner. The Shah's\r\nanger was great on hearing of this shameful treachery, but as the\r\nGovernor pleaded powerlessness from want of troops, and helplessness\r\nbefore the fanaticism of the frenzied mob led by Moullas, the matter was\r\nallowed to drop.\r\n\r\nConsidering the great numbers of Babis all over Persia, and the ease\r\nwith which membership can be proved, it strikes many observers as\r\nstrange that murderous outbreaks against them are not more frequent. The\r\nexplanation is that, besides the accepted Babis, there is a vast number\r\nof close sympathizers, between whom and the declared members of the sect\r\nthere is but one step, and a continued strong persecution would drive\r\nthem into the ranks of the oppressed. It might then be found that the\r\nmajority was with the Babis, and this fear is a fact which, irrespective\r\nof other arguments, enables the influential and liberal-minded Moullas\r\nto control their headstrong and over-zealous brethren.\r\n\r\nThe isolated outbreaks that do occur are generally produced by personal\r\nanimosity and greed of gain. Just as has been known in other countries\r\nwhere a proscribed religion was practised in secret, and protection\r\nagainst persecution and informers secured by means of money, so in many\r\nplaces the Babis have made friends in this manner out of enemies.\r\nIndividuals sometimes are troubled by the needy and unscrupulous who\r\naffect an excess of religious zeal, but these desist on their terms\r\nbeing met. Occasionally in a settlement of bazaar trading-accounts, the\r\ndebtor, who is a Mohammedan, being pressed by his creditor, whom he\r\nknows to be a Babi, threatens to denounce him publicly in order to avoid\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nI witnessed an instance of 'sanctuary' asylum being claimed in the\r\nstable of one of the foreign legations at Tehran by a well-known\r\nPersian merchant, a Babi, who fled for his life before the bazaar\r\nruffians to whom his debtor had denounced him, urging them to smite and\r\nslay the heretic. It was believed that the practice of black-mailing the\r\nBabis was such a well-known successful one at Yezd that some of the low\r\nMohammedans of the town tried to share in the profits and were\r\ndisappointed. This, it was said, led to the massacre which occurred\r\nthere in April, 1891.\r\n\r\nThe Babis, notwithstanding divergence of opinion on many points, yet\r\nattend the mosques and the Moulla teachings, and comply with all the\r\noutward forms of religion, in order to avert the anger which continued\r\nabsence from the congregation would draw upon them from hostile and\r\nbigoted neighbours. Two of them were suddenly taxed in the Musjid with\r\nholding heterodox opinions, and were then accused of being Babis. The\r\ndiscussion was carried outside and into the bazaar, the accusers loudly\r\nreviling and threatening them. They were poor, and were thus unable to\r\nfind protectors at once. When being pressed hard by an excited mob which\r\nhad collected on the scene, an over-zealous friend came to their aid,\r\nand said, 'Well, if they are Babis, what harm have they done to anyone?'\r\n\r\nOn this the tumult began, and the ferocity of the fanatical crowd rose\r\nto blood-heat. The sympathizer was seized, and as the gathering grew,\r\nthe opportunity to gratify private animosity and satisfy opposing\r\ninterests was taken advantage of, and three other Babis were added,\r\nmaking six in all who were dragged before the Governor to be condemned\r\nas members of an accursed sect. The Moullas urged them to save their\r\nlives by cursing the Bab, but they all refused. The wives and children\r\nof some of them were sent for so that their feelings might be worked\r\nupon to renounce their creed and live, but this had no effect in shaking\r\ntheir resolution. When told that death awaited them, they replied that\r\nthey would soon live again. When argued with on this point of their\r\nbelief, they merely said that they could not say how it was to be, but\r\nthey knew it would be so. They were then given over to the cruel mob,\r\nand were hacked to death, firm in their faith to the last.\r\n\r\nThe temptation to make away with others in a similar manner produced\r\ntwo more victims during the night, but these the Governor tried to save\r\nby keeping them in custody. The brutal mob, however, howled for their\r\nblood, and made such an uproar that the weak Governor, a youth of\r\neighteen, surrendered them to a cruel death, as he had done the others.\r\nThese two, like their brethren, refused to curse the Bab and live.\r\n\r\nThe Moullas have ever been defeated in their efforts to produce\r\nrecantation from a Babi, and it is this remarkable steadfastness in\r\ntheir faith which has carried conviction into the hearts of many that\r\nthe sect is bound to triumph in the end. The thoughtful say admiringly\r\nof them, as the Romans said of the Christians, whom they in vain doomed\r\nto death under every form of terror, 'What manner of men are these, who\r\nface a dreadful death fearlessly to hold fast to their faith?' An\r\ninstance is mentioned of a Babi who did recant in order to escape the\r\nmartyr's death, but he afterwards returned to his faith, and suffered\r\ncalmly the death he had feared before.\r\n\r\nThe Moullas who led the Yezd massacre desired to associate the whole\r\ntown in the crime, and called for the illumination of the bazaars in\r\ntoken of public joy. The order for this was given, but the Governor was\r\nwarned in time to issue a countermand. It was found by the state of\r\npublic feeling, and told to those in authority, who were able to realize\r\nthe danger, that, as one-half or more of the shopkeepers were Babis,\r\nthey would not have illuminated, for to have done so would imply\r\napproval of the murders and denial of their faith. Their determination\r\nto refuse to join in the demonstration of joy would have roused further\r\nmob fury, and the whole body of Babis, impelled by the instinct of\r\nself-preservation, would have risen to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nThe late Shah was deeply troubled and pained on hearing of this cruel\r\nmassacre, and removed the Governor, who was his own grandson (being the\r\neldest son of his Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan), notwithstanding the\r\nexcuses urged in his favour, that the priestly power which roused the\r\nmob was too strong for him to act and prevent the murders. It is\r\nprobable that the Government is assured of the peaceful nature of the\r\nBabi movement as it now exists; and with the orders to put an end to\r\npersecution, supported in some degree by popular feeling, we may hope\r\nto hear no more of such crimes as were committed at Isfahan and Yezd in\r\n1890 and 1891.\r\n\r\nThe Babi reform manifests an important advance upon all previous modern\r\nOriental systems in its treatment of woman. Polygamy and concubinage are\r\nforbidden, the use of the veil is discouraged, and the equality of the\r\nsexes is so thoroughly recognised that one, at least, of the nineteen\r\nsovereign prophets must always be a female. This is a return to the\r\nposition of woman in early Persia, of which Malcolm speaks when he says\r\nthat Quintus Curtius told of Alexander not seating himself in the\r\npresence of Sisygambis till told to do so by that matron, because it was\r\nnot the custom in Persia for sons to sit in presence of their mother.\r\nThis anecdote is quoted to show the great respect in which the female\r\nsex were held in Persia at the time of Alexander's invasion, and which\r\nalso was regarded as one of the principal causes of the progress the\r\ncountry had made in civilization. The Parsees to this day conduct\r\nthemselves on somewhat similar lines, and though we have not the\r\nopportunities of judging of maternal respect which were allowed to the\r\nGreeks, yet the fact of the same custom being shown in a father's\r\npresence at the present time seems to point to the rule of good manners\r\nto mothers being yet observed. And we know, from what happened on the\r\ndeath of Mohamed Shah in 1848, that a capable woman is allowed by public\r\nopinion to exercise openly a powerful influence in affairs of State at a\r\ncritical time when wise counsels are required. The Queen-mother at that\r\ntime became the president of the State Council, and cleverly succeeded\r\nin conciliating adverse parties and strengthening the Government, till\r\nthe position of the young Shah, the late Sovereign, was made secure.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Russia and England were regarded as the only great\r\nPowers really interested in the future of Persia; but within the last\r\nfew years it has been observed that Turkey, in showing an intention to\r\nconsolidate her power in the Baghdad and Erzeroum pashaliks, was likely\r\nto be in a position to renew old claims on the Persian border. France\r\nhas also lately increased her interest in Persia, and Germany has now\r\nentered the field of enterprise there in the practical manner of\r\nimproving the road from Khani Kin, on the Turkish frontier, to Tehran,\r\nconnecting it with a road from Baghdad. It will probably be found that\r\nthis road-scheme belongs to the company under German auspices who are\r\nnow constructing a railway which is ultimately to connect Baghdad with\r\nthe Bosphorus, and part of which is already working. The trunk-line\r\npasses by Angora, Kaisarieh, Diarbekr, Mardin, and Mosul; and a\r\nloop-line leaves it at Eski Shehr, which, going by Konia, Marasch, and\r\nOrfa, rejoins it at Diarbekr.\r\n\r\nThere was an idea that, as Konia is a most promising field for the\r\nproduction of exports, the Smyrna lines competed so eagerly for the\r\nconcession to extend there that the Porte was enabled to make terms with\r\nthe Anatolian Railway Company (to which I have alluded) for the\r\nextension to Baghdad, which strategically is of great importance. It was\r\nsaid that the strong competition placed the Government in the position\r\nof the man in the Eastern story who went to the bazaar to sell an old\r\ncamel, and a young cat of rare beauty. The cat was shown off sitting on\r\nthe camel, and was desired by many purchasers; but there was no bid for\r\nthe camel. The competition for the cat ran high, and then the owner\r\nannounced that the one could not be sold without the other, on which the\r\ncamel was bought with the cat. But as a matter of fact there was no\r\nopening for competition for the Konia branch. The Anatolian Railway had\r\npreferential rights for what is called the southern or loop line, which\r\nI have mentioned as passing through Konia, and rejoining the main or\r\nnorthern line at Diarbekr. They also have preferential rights of\r\nextension to Baghdad, and they mean to carry the line there.\r\n\r\nThe Smyrna Aidin railway has lately had a considerable improvement in\r\nits traffic, from the barley of Asia Minor being in increased demand in\r\naddition to its wheat. This means that the material for the beer as well\r\nas the bread of the masses elsewhere is found to be abundant and cheap\r\nthere, and the extension of railway communication in those regions will\r\nmost probably increase the supply and demand. The same trade in barley\r\nhas lately sprung up in Southern Persia and Turkish Arabia, and for some\r\ntime past, while the low price of wheat discouraged the existing wheat\r\ntrade there, it has been found profitable to export barley from the\r\nGulf ports. Barley is the cheapest grain in Persia, where it is grown\r\nfor home consumption only, being the universal food for horses. Owing to\r\nwant of care with the seed, and the close vicinity of crops, the wheat\r\nwas often so mixed with barley as to reduce the price considerably, and\r\nthe question of mixture and reduction was always a very stormy one. When\r\nI was at Ahwaz, on the Karun, in 1890, I saw a machine at work\r\nseparating the grains, and the Arab owners waiting to take away the\r\nunsaleable barley, the wheat being bought for export by a European firm\r\nthere which owned the machine. The Arab sellers probably now move to the\r\nother side of the machine to carry away the unsaleable wheat, the barley\r\nbeing bought for export owing to the turn of trade.\r\n\r\nThe German group that has obtained the Persian road concession has also\r\ntaken up the old project of an extension of the Tehran tramways to the\r\nvillages on the slopes of the Shimran range, all within a distance of\r\nten miles from the town. The Court, the city notables, and the foreign\r\nlegations, with everyone who desires to be fashionable, and can afford\r\nthe change, reside there during the warm months--June, July, August and\r\nSeptember. The whole place may be described as the summer suburb of the\r\ncapital, and there is great going to and fro.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the Russian road now under construction from\r\nthe Caspian Sea base to Kasvin, with the object of enabling Russian\r\ntrade to command more thoroughly the Tehran market. The total distance\r\nfrom the coast to the capital is two hundred miles. There is an\r\nold-established caravan track over easy country, from Kasvin to Hamadan\r\nin the south--west, distant about one hundred and fifty miles. It has\r\nlately been announced that the Russian Road Company has obtained a\r\nconcession to convert this track into a cart-road in continuation of\r\nthat from Resht. It is seen that with improved communication Russian\r\ntrade may be made to compete successfully at Hamadan, which is only\r\nabout fifty miles further from the Caspian Sea base than Tehran, and\r\nthere will also be the advantage of a return trade in cotton from\r\nCentral Persia, as Armenian merchants now export it to Russia from as\r\nfar South as Isfahan and Yezd. The German road from Baghdad to Tehran\r\nwill be met at Hamadan.\r\n\r\nKermanshah and Hamadan, through which the German road will pass, are\r\nboth busy centres of trade in districts rich in corn, wool, and wine.\r\nThey are also meeting-points of the great and ever-flowing streams of\r\npilgrims to Kerbela _viâ_ Baghdad, said to number annually about one\r\nhundred thousand. This has been a popular pilgrim route, as well as\r\ntrade route, for centuries, and with greater facilities on an improved\r\nroad the traffic is certain to increase.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the alignment of the Russian road from Resht is to be\r\nmade in view of a railway in the future. The same will probably be done\r\nin the Hamadan extension, and it is believed that the German road will\r\nbe similarly planned. All this would mean that behind the concessions\r\nare further promises for the time when railway construction comes.\r\nLooking into the dim distance, the eye of faith and hope may see the\r\nfulfilment of railway communication from India to Europe by a connection\r\nbetween the Quetta or Indus Valley line and Kermanshah.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the agreement of 1890 between Persia and Russia to\r\nshut out railways till the end of the century. This agreement, when made\r\nknown, was regarded as proof of a somewhat barbarian policy on the part\r\nof Russia, unwilling or unable herself to assist in opening up Persia\r\nand improving the condition of the country. But there is some reason for\r\nthe idea that the Shah himself was ready to meet the Russian request, so\r\nas to keep back the railway which he feared would soon connect his\r\ncapital with the Caucasus. There was much railway talk in Persia in\r\n1890, and Russia knew that it would take quite ten years to complete her\r\nrailway system up to the Northern frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan.\r\nThe railway now being made from Tiflis to Alexandropol and Kars will\r\nprobably send out a line down the fertile valley of the Aras to Julfa,\r\nready for extension across the Persian frontier to Tabriz, and a branch\r\nmay be pushed forward from Doshakh, or Keribent, on the Trans-Caspian\r\nrailway, to Sarakhs, where Russia, Persia, and Afghanistan meet, to\r\nfacilitate trade with Herat as well as Meshed. In the meanwhile also the\r\ncart-roads, ready for railway purposes if wanted, from the Caspian Sea\r\nbase to Kasvin, Tehran, and Hamadan, will be completed.\r\n\r\nRussia insisted on regarding the opening of the Karun to the navigation\r\nof the world as a diplomatic victory for England, and a distinct\r\nconcession to British commerce, which is predominant in the South. She\r\ntherefore thought out well what to get from the Shah in return, to\r\nfavour her commercial policy in the North, and the ten years'\r\nprohibition of railways was the result. Russia desires commercial\r\npredominance in Persia just as England does, and she will use all the\r\ninfluence which her dominating close neighbourhood gives to obtain the\r\nutmost favour and facilities for her trade.\r\n\r\nWhile Russia and England were thus engaged in strong commercial rivalry,\r\nGermany unexpectedly made her appearance in the Western region of\r\nCentral Persia, where their competition meets. Nor has Persia been idle\r\nin trading enterprise; her merchants are not only aiming at getting more\r\nexclusively into their own hands the interior commerce of the country,\r\nbut they have established direct relations with firms in foreign\r\ncountries, and now work in active competition with the European houses\r\nwhich in old days had almost all the export and import trade in their\r\nown hands. The introduction of the Imperial Bank of Persia has given an\r\nimpetus to this new spirit of native enterprise by affording facilities\r\nwhich before were not available on the same favourable terms. The Nasiri\r\nCompany, a mercantile corporation of Persians, was formed in 1889 to\r\ntrade on the Karun, and it commenced operations with two small steamers.\r\nLater, a third steamer was added, and they are now negotiating for the\r\npurchase of a fourth. They have a horse tramway, about one and a half\r\nmiles long, to facilitate the necessary transhipment of cargo between\r\nthe upper and lower streams, where the Ahwaz Rapids break the river\r\nnavigation. This trading corporation has strong support, and the Persian\r\nGovernment is earnest in giving it every assistance, so that it may\r\ndevelop into an effectual agency for the revival of the prosperity which\r\nmade the Karun Valley in old times what the Nile Valley is now.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Lynch Brothers also run a large steamer on the Lower Karun in\r\nconnection with a 'stern-wheeler' (Nile boat pattern) on the upper\r\nstream, and between them and the Nasiri Company a regular and quick\r\ncommunication is maintained between Bombay and Shuster. One of the\r\narticles of import at the latter place is American kerosene-oil for lamp\r\npurposes, to take the place of the Shuster crude petroleum, said to have\r\nbeen used there for centuries. This petroleum contains an unusual amount\r\nof benzine, and being highly explosive in lamps, the Shuster people, who\r\ncan afford to pay for the safer substance, have taken to American oil.\r\nThe Shuster petroleum-springs belong to a family of Syuds in the town,\r\nand did not fall within the field of the Persian Mines Corporation.\r\nThese oil-springs may yet become the object of practical operations\r\nshould the Nasiri Company develop the resources of the Karun Valley.\r\n\r\nBelgium has also taken an active interest in Persia lately, the tramway\r\ncompany, and the glass manufactory at Tehran, and the beet-sugar factory\r\nin the vicinity, having all been established with Belgian capital; and\r\nHolland, who is believed to be seeking an opening in Persia, may find\r\nher opportunity in the Karun Valley irrigation works. The creation of\r\nstrong international interests in Persia should have the best effect in\r\nstrengthening her national independence, developing her natural\r\nresources, and introducing good government. And the peaceful succession\r\nof the lawful heir to the throne should go far to carry the country\r\nforward in the path of progress and prosperity. It is evident that the\r\nstrong sentiment attaching to the late Shah's long and peaceful reign,\r\nand the popular feeling of loyalty to him which influenced the people,\r\nhas had the effect of enforcing the royal will in favour of the heir\r\nlegitimately appointed by Nasr-ed-Din Shah.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESENT SHAH WHEN ENTERING HIS CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe reigning family of Persia are the hereditary chiefs of the royal\r\nKajar tribe, and still preserve the customs of that position. They have\r\nnot changed the manly habits of a warlike race for the luxury and\r\nlethargy which sapped the energies and ruined the lives of so many\r\nmonarchs of Persia. Up to the time of the present ruling dynasty the\r\nprinces of the blood were immured in the harem, where their education\r\nwas left to women and their attendants, and until the death of the King\r\nhis destined successor was not known. At that period the son of the\r\nlowest slave in the harem was deemed equally eligible to succeed to the\r\nthrone with the offspring of the proudest princess who boasted the\r\nhonour of marriage with the Sovereign. And similarly as in the West,\r\nup to about four hundred years ago, the Crown was generally made secure\r\nby murder, every actual or possible rival for the throne being blinded\r\nor removed from the scene. This was the practice of the Soffivean\r\ndynasty, which preceded the Kajar. But with the change which then took\r\nplace, this hideous practice disappeared, and usages more congenial to\r\nthe feelings of the military tribes which support the throne were\r\nestablished. Under the late Shah the princes of the blood were employed\r\nin the chief governments of the country, and exercised all the powers\r\nand responsibilities of office.\r\n\r\nPersia may be described as a theocratic democracy under an absolute\r\nmonarchy. There is no hereditary rank but that of royal birth, and that\r\nof the chiefs of the military tribes, who may be regarded as a military\r\naristocracy; but there is a system of life titles which secure to the\r\nholders certain privileges and immunities, and are much prized. The\r\ntitles are nominally descriptive of some personal quality, talent, or\r\ntrust, such as Councillor of the State, Confidant of the King, Trusted\r\nof the Sultan; they are also bestowed upon ladies in high position. The\r\nname of an animal is never introduced into the title; at least, I have\r\nonly heard of one instance to the contrary in modern times. An\r\nindividual of European parentage was recommended to the late Shah's\r\nnotice and favour by his Persian patrons, and they mentioned his great\r\nwish to be honoured with a title. His Majesty, who had a keen sense of\r\nhumour, observed the suggestive appearance of the candidate for honours,\r\nand said, 'Well, he is Hujabr-i-Mulk' (the Lion of the Country). The new\r\nnoble was ready with his grateful thanks: 'Your sacred Majesty, may I be\r\nthy sacrifice;' but he added in a subdued tone, 'A lion requires at\r\nleast a lamb a day.' The Shah laughed at the meaning speech, and said,\r\n'Let him have it.' The granting of a title does not give any emolument\r\nunless specially directed. As a precedent for this title, the Shah may\r\nhave had in his mind the story of Ali Kuli Khan, one of the favourites\r\nof Shah Suliman. During the reign of Shah Abbas this chief was generally\r\nin prison, except when his services were required against the enemies of\r\nhis country. This had gained for him the name of the Lion of Persia, as\r\nmen said that he was always chained except when wanted to fight.\r\n\r\nThe Shah can raise whomsoever he chooses from the lowest to the highest\r\nposition or post, except in the most powerful of the nomad tribes, where\r\nthe nomination to chieftainship is confined to the elders of the leading\r\nfamilies, who generally represent two lines from one head, one being in\r\nthe opposition when the other is in power. The chieftain of a clan\r\nconsiders himself superior in real rank to the most favoured Court\r\ntitle-holder, and the chiefs of the military tribes may be termed the\r\nhereditary nobility of Persia. The monarch may, by his influence or\r\ndirect power, alter the succession, and place an uncle in the situation\r\nof a nephew, and sometimes a younger brother in the condition of an\r\nelder, but the leader of the tribe must be of the family of their chief.\r\nThe younger sons and nephews are enrolled in the royal guard, and the\r\nShah is thus enabled by judicious change and selection to keep his hold\r\nupon the tribe. Change of chiefs is not always effected peacefully. The\r\nwild tribesmen who, in feudal fashion, attach themselves as idle\r\nmen-at-arms to a popular leader are sometimes disinclined to accept his\r\nfall from favour without an appeal to arms. But the royal authority\r\nprevails in the end, and the new chiefs rule begins, and lasts just so\r\nlong as Fortune smiles and the Shah wills.\r\n\r\nA marked instance of this was shown in July, 1892, when Jehan Shah\r\nKhan-Ilbegi was deprived of the chieftaincy of the Afshar section of the\r\npowerful Shahsevend tribe, who range from Ardebil to Tehran. The famous\r\nNadir Shah was originally a simple trooper of this tribe, and belonged\r\nto the colony of it which was planted at Deregez on the Turkoman border.\r\nThe ostensible cause of the chiefs removal from power was that with his\r\nown hands he had killed his wife, the sister of his cousin,\r\nRahmat-ulla-Khan, who was known to be his rival in the tribe for place\r\nand power. Jehan Shah had unjustly accused her of being unfaithful to\r\nhim, and going to her house, he called her out, and, notwithstanding her\r\nappearing with a copy of the Sacred Koran in her hand, shot her dead\r\nwhile in the act of swearing on the holy book that she was innocent of\r\nall guilt. Jehan Shah than went in search of the tribesman whom he\r\nsuspected of being her paramour, and killed him also. The matter was\r\nreported to the Shah, then in camp in Irak, who ordered Jebam Shah to\r\nbe deprived of the chieftainship, and Rahmat-ulla-Khan to be appointed\r\nIlbegi in his place. It was further ordered that Jehan Shah should be\r\narrested and sent as a prisoner to Tehran. The Ihtisham-e-Dowleh-Kajâr,\r\ncousin of the late Shah and Governor of Khamseh, in which province Jehan\r\nShah was then located with his clan, was directed to carry out the royal\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nMuch telegraphing had taken place on the subject, and as cipher was not\r\nused, Jehan Shah, by means of money and influence, was able to obtain\r\nthe fullest information of all that passed, and as he was known to have\r\na numerous personal following armed with Peabody-Martini rifles, the\r\nGovernor was instructed to act with caution. He accordingly had recourse\r\nto stratagem, and gave out that the object of his journey to the tribal\r\nquarters was to coerce a section of the tribe which had been giving\r\ntrouble. He therefore asked Jehan Shah to assist him, and this gave the\r\nchief a good excuse for assembling his men. The Prince Governor took\r\nwith him one hundred cavalry and four hundred infantry, but no attention\r\nwas paid to the ammunition, and they started without a proper supply.\r\n\r\nRahmat-ulla-Khan was fully aware of the Governor's real intentions, but\r\nthe influence and power of the popular chief prevented any partisan\r\ngathering against him. He therefore could only depend upon the Persian\r\ntroops to enforce the order of the Shah, and was unable to do more than\r\nprepare a reception tent and provide a luncheon for the Prince and his\r\npeople, about eight miles in advance of their camp, at a place appointed\r\nfor the meeting with himself and Jehan Shah. On approaching this place,\r\nthese two, with the elders and the tribesmen, went forward for the\r\ncustomary ceremonial reception of the Governor. Jehan Shah dismounted\r\nand saluted with the utmost show of respect; but on reaching the tent\r\nwhich had been prepared for them by his rival, he declined to enter and\r\npartake of his hospitality, declaring that he preferred to pass on to\r\nhis own tents, some distance off, his mounted following of fifteen\r\nhundred men accompanying him. The Governor knew that Jehan Shah had\r\nbecome dangerous from the devotion of his well-armed followers, and the\r\nreadiness of the main body of the fierce fighting tribesmen to support\r\nhim. He had evidently contemplated his arrest and seizure at the place\r\nof meeting, but the show of force and feeling in Jehan Shah's favour was\r\ntoo strong to admit of any such attempt. He therefore decided to declare\r\nopenly the object of his coming, and after lunch he assembled the elders\r\nof the tribe, and summoned Jehan Shah to his presence, who, however,\r\ndeclined to obey. The Prince on this announced his deposition, and the\r\nappointment of Rahmat-ulla-Khan in his place, showing at the same time\r\nthe Shah's written commands. He then appears to have indulged in some\r\nviolent abuse of Jehan Shah, and again sent an order to secure his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, that chief had taken counsel with his tribal\r\nfollowing, numbering about fifteen hundred, armed with breechloaders,\r\nand finding them entirely on his side, and determined to dispute the\r\nrule of his rival, he served out cartridges freely, and decided to\r\ndiscuss the matter with the Governor. He left most of his men at some\r\ndistance, and presented himself attended by only a few. The Prince\r\ninformed him of the Shah's orders, and after some contentious talk, he\r\nheld out the royal firman for him or any of those with him to read. On\r\none of the elders moving forward to take the paper, Jehan Shah suddenly\r\nmotioned them all back with his hands, and the Prince, taking alarm at\r\nthis appearance of a signal, called out to his guards to seize Jehan\r\nShah. There was a shout and a rush, and some of Jehan Shah's men from\r\nbehind fired over the heads of the soldiers, who, however, returned the\r\nfire point-blank, killing and wounding several of the Shahsevends. The\r\ntribesmen then opened fire in earnest, and the Prince with his troops\r\npromptly fled. All ran and rode for their lives, pursued by the furious\r\nenemy. Some of the servants kept with their master, and remounted him\r\ntwice when the horses he rode were wounded and disabled. The tribesmen\r\nare said to have made him a special target, for he was most conspicuous\r\nin rich dress, and a third time he and his horse were rolled over\r\ntogether, he receiving two bullet-wounds. He was then seized, partially\r\nstripped, and treated with great indignity. The pursuit was kept up to\r\nhis camp, which was captured and plundered; thirty-five of his men were\r\nkilled, and fifty wounded. One of the Prince's officials, also\r\nwounded, was taken with him, and both were kept prisoners for three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIAN TURK OF THE MILITARY TRIBES]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Jehan Shah, having recovered from his mad fury, trembled\r\nat the recollection of his crime, and dreading the vengeance which he\r\nsaw was certain to follow, he packed up his valuables and fled with a\r\nfew followers to the Caspian coast. He had the intention to escape by\r\nsteamer to Baku, but failing in this, owing to all communication with\r\nRussian territory having been suspended during the outbreak of cholera\r\nthen prevailing, he determined to make his way by land across the\r\nNorthern frontier. Being closely pursued by a party of Persian cavalry,\r\nhe abandoned all his baggage, and with great difficulty reached Tabriz,\r\nwhere he was constrained to take sanctuary in the house of the chief\r\nMoulla. He died there after enduring existence for about six months\r\nunder circumstances and with surroundings which must have been supremely\r\nhateful to him. I was at Tabriz in the end of 1892, while he was there,\r\nand I was told by one who had seen him that he was a sad sight then, the\r\nhereditary head of the Afshar Shahsevends, a section of a royal tribe,\r\nherding in misery with a crowd of criminals seeking sanctuary in order\r\nto avoid the avenger of blood. On the first news of the occurrence the\r\nShah ordered the immediate mobilization of the infantry regiments of\r\nKhamseh and Kasvin, and this had the effect of dispersing the tribe,\r\nfacilitating the work of retribution, and establishing the power of the\r\nnew chief. This incident had the best political result in aiding the\r\nKajar policy of breaking up the ruling families and the cohesion of the\r\ndangerous tribes, and asserting fully the authority of the Tehran\r\nCentral Government. Jehan Shah had gradually improved and strengthened\r\nhis position by increasing the superior armament of his tribesmen (who\r\nwere said to have three thousand breechloaders) and laying in a large\r\nsupply of cartridges, so that, with his wealth, influence, and\r\npopularity, he must have been regarded as dangerously powerful. No doubt\r\nthe conceited confidence thus produced led him to indulge in the\r\nungovernable rage which wrecked his freedom and ended his life. The\r\ntribesmen said that the wife whom he killed was truly innocent; but\r\nbeing themselves men of wild ways and tempestuous temper, they thought\r\nhe had been harshly judged, and they therefore stood by him to resist\r\nhis seizure and deportation.\r\n\r\nAs in England four hundred years ago, every place of worship is a sacred\r\nrefuge; and the dwelling-house of the Chief Priest gives similar\r\nprotection. This right of sanctuary continues in force throughout\r\nPersia; but to benefit by it for any length of time, money is very\r\nnecessary, for without such aid, or when the supplies fail, starvation\r\nsteps in to drive the refugee out. While in sanctuary, compromise and\r\narrangement may be effected, so that the fugitive may be allowed to go\r\nunmolested, the relatives paying, or becoming 'bail' for, the\r\nblood-money or compensation agreed upon. A fugitive from justice,\r\noppression, or revenge often claims the privilege of sanctuary in the\r\nhouse or premises of a local dignitary of influence, whose house would\r\nnot be unceremoniously entered by pursuers, and this affords time either\r\nto meet the demands or accusations made, or to escape to a safer place.\r\n\r\nAt Tehran there is a big gun, said to have been brought by Nadir Shah\r\nfrom Delhi, and known as the Pearl Cannon. It is said to be so called\r\nfrom having had a string of pearls hung on it near the muzzle when it\r\nwas on show in Imperial Delhi. This was probably the case, for we know\r\nthat heavy guns in India were regarded with a degree of respect and\r\nreverence almost approaching worship. The gunners of the Maharajah\r\nRunjeet Singh, the Lion of the Punjab, used to 'salaam' to their guns,\r\nand to hang garlands of the sweet-scented _champak_ flower, which is\r\nused in temples and at festivals, round the muzzles. The Pearl Cannon\r\noccupies a prominent position close to the Shah's palace, and has always\r\nbeen recognised as possessing a semi-sacred character, and giving the\r\nright of sanctuary to those who touch it and remain by it.\r\n\r\nI remember a regiment of infantry, represented by three hundred men who\r\nwere 'off duty' and available for the demonstration, claiming the\r\nprivilege of this great gun sanctuary after they had assailed the house\r\nof their Colonel in order to wreak their vengeance on him, as he was\r\nsuspected of withholding their pay. The officer's servants were warned\r\nin time, and closed the courtyard door, so that the rioters were unable\r\nto enter; but they relieved their feelings by battering the door with\r\nstones and damaging the Colonel's carriage, which they found outside.\r\nHaving thus created a great disturbance and excited considerable rumour,\r\nthey proceeded to the Pearl Cannon, and gave vent to their grievances in\r\nloud cries, which reached the royal palace, on which the Shah,\r\nNasr-ed-Din, was made acquainted with all the facts, and caused the\r\nsoldiers' wrongs to be redressed. One of the charges against the Colonel\r\nwas that he had managed, by lending money to the men, to gain possession\r\nof their village lands by unfair means--for he was a landlord in the\r\nsame district, and desired to add to his holding. The corps was the\r\nLârâjani territorial infantry battalion, and an English resident at\r\nTehran, who caught the name as Larry-Johnny, said the whole incident was\r\n'quite Irish, you know.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n--The military tribes and the royal guard\r\n--Men of the people as great monarchs\r\n--Persian sense of humour\r\n--Nightingales and poetry\r\n--Legendary origin of the royal emblem\r\n--Lion and Sun\r\n--Ancient Golden Eagle emblem\r\n--The Blacksmith's Apron the royal standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warlike nomads form a most important part of the military strength\r\nof Persia, and it has always been the policy of the Sovereign to secure\r\ntheir personal attachment to him as the direct paramount chief of each\r\nmartial clan. In pursuance of this policy, the royal guard, known as\r\nGholam-i-Shah, or Slaves of the King, which protects and escorts the\r\nShah in camp and quarters, is mainly composed of bodies of horse\r\nfurnished from the best and most powerful of the military tribes. These\r\ncome from all quarters of the empire, and are headed and officered by\r\nmembers of the most influential families, so that they may be regarded\r\nas hostages for the loyalty and fidelity of the chiefs. All are changed\r\nfrom time to time, and thus a system of short service prevails, to give\r\nas many as possible a term of duty with the royal guard.\r\n\r\nThe term _gholam_, or slave, has always been given as a title to the\r\npersonal guards, and everyone who is admitted to the corps claims the\r\nenvied distinction of Gholam-i-Shah. This guard has a very ancient\r\norigin, and service in it is highly prized as giving opportunities of\r\nattracting the attention and gaining the favour of the King. The great\r\nSovereign Sabuktagin, who reigned in the tenth century, was said to have\r\nrisen from the ranks of the royal guard. All the couriers of the foreign\r\nlegations at Tehran are styled Gholam, and the title is accepted as an\r\nhonourable one, meaning a mounted servant of courage and trust, who is\r\nready to defend to the death all interests committed to his charge.\r\n\r\nThe total strength of 'the guard' is twelve hundred and fifty, of whom\r\ntwo hundred are the élite, called _gholam peshkhidmet_ (personal\r\nattendants) and mostly belong to the Kajar, the Shah's own tribe, with\r\nwhich his Majesty always identified himself in the most public manner,\r\nand thus made every man proud of his clanship with the King. I here\r\nallude to the royal signature, 'Nasr-ed-Din, Shah, Kajar.' These\r\nsuperior guardsmen have all the rank of gentleman, and may be called the\r\nmounted 'gentlemen at arms' of the guard. They have the customary right\r\nof appointment to Court and palace posts, such as door-keeper, usher,\r\nmessenger, etc. Their service is for life, and is hereditary, a son\r\nsucceeding his father, and taking his place in the guard when promotion,\r\nage, illness, or death creates a vacancy. They have distinctive\r\nhorse-trappings with silver neck-straps, breastplates, and headstalls,\r\nwhich pass from father to son, and have become highly prized heirlooms.\r\nThe Shah was most partial to the representative tribesmen of his guard,\r\nand his happy characteristics as a King of nomadic taste and camp-like\r\nways, in familiar acquaintance with all about him, were well shown at a\r\nmilitary review which I witnessed at Tehran some years ago. The review\r\nwas a special one, held in honour of the Swedish officers deputed by\r\nKing Oscar II. of Norway and Sweden to convey the high order of the\r\nSeraphin to his Majesty the Shah, and as many troops as possible were\r\ncalled in from the surrounding districts to take part in it. The royal\r\nguard mustered strong, and when they marched past, the Shah stepped\r\nforward to the saluting line, so as to be closer to them, and called out\r\nto each troop, and named each commander in terms of praise and pleasure.\r\nThis display of personal knowledge of the men, and acquaintance with\r\ntheir leaders, drew from them a perfect buzz of delight.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the smart appearance of the Bakhtiari horse attracted\r\nparticular attention. The Persian bystanders showed their pride in these\r\npopular mounted mountaineers by the admiring exclamation, 'Here come the\r\nBakhtiaris!' They were very noticeable by their white felt, round,\r\nbrimless hats, and the good line they preserved when passing. The\r\nBakhtiaris (Lurs) are the most numerous and powerful of all the military\r\ntribes, and are noted for their superior martial qualities both as horse\r\nand foot. They are of the most ancient Persian descent, and have held\r\nthe hills and valleys of Luristan from time immemorial; while all the\r\nother military tribes may be said to be of much later date, and of\r\nforeign origin--Arab, Syrian, Turk, and Tartar. Competent authorities,\r\nwho have had full opportunity of judging, agree in saying that they are\r\nas good material for soldiers as can be found anywhere. I was greatly\r\ninterested in hearing the Shah's Prime Minister speak in glowing terms\r\nof the gallantry of the Bakhtiari infantry at the capture of Kandahar\r\nunder Nadir Shah, who, after subduing them in their own mountains, won\r\nthem over to serve him loyally and well in his conquering campaigns\r\nagainst Afghanistan and India. The Grand Vizier mentioned the\r\ncircumstance of the Bakhtiari contingent, after one of the many repulses\r\nmet in the repeated attempts to carry Kandahar by storm, having in the\r\nevening, when all was quiet on both sides, assaulted without orders and\r\ncaptured a commanding, position in the defences, which they had failed\r\nto take during the day. The shouts of the victors roused the resting\r\nbesiegers, and Nadir at once took advantage of the success to carry the\r\ncitadel and gain possession of the town. As a closing remark concerning\r\nthese nomad tribes, I may mention that they regard themselves as in\r\nevery way superior to the settled inhabitants, and express this conceit\r\nin their saying, 'One man of the tents is equal to two of the town.'\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the prerogative of the Shah to raise whomsoever he\r\nchooses from the lowest to the highest position, except under\r\nrestrictions in the military tribes. This quite falls in with the\r\ndemocratic spirit which lies dormant among the people, ready to be\r\ndisplayed in willingness to accept a Sovereign of signal power who\r\nsprings from the lower ranks of life. The social equality which Islam\r\ngrants to all men was nothing new to Persia in forming ideas regarding a\r\npopular leader and elected King. The descent of such a man is deemed of\r\nlittle consequence in the minds of a people who look to personification\r\nof power as the right to rule. In fact, with them it is said that the\r\nfame of such a man is in proportion to the lowness of his origin. They\r\nknow of notable instances of the nation being delivered from terrible\r\ntyranny and degrading foreign subjection, and being made gloriously\r\ngreat, by men of the people. They point to Kawâh, the blacksmith, who\r\nheaded a revolt against the monstrously cruel usurper King Zohâk, using\r\nhis apron as a banner, and finally overthrew and slew him, and placed\r\nFaridûn, a Prince of the Peshdâdian dynasty, on the throne which he\r\nmight have occupied himself. This blacksmith's apron continued for ages\r\nto be the royal standard of Persia. In the ninth century,\r\nYacub-bin-Leis, called the Pewterer, as he had worked when young at that\r\n(his father's) trade, made his way to the throne by sheer force of\r\nstrong character and stout courage. He remained the people's hero to the\r\nlast, was noted for his simple habits, for keeping with his name his\r\ntrade appellation (Suffâri, the Pewterer), and for never having been\r\nwantonly cruel or oppressive. In the tenth century, when the great\r\nSabuktagin rose from soldier to Sovereign, we see the principle of\r\nselection in preference to hereditary succession practised and accepted\r\nby the nation. And the choice was justified by the glory he gave to the\r\nPersian arms in extending the empire to India, and in the further\r\nconquests of his soldier-son, Mahmud, who succeeded to his father's\r\nthrone, and added still more to the greatness of the kingdom, till it\r\nreached from Baghdad to Kashgar, from Georgia to Bengal, from the Oxus\r\nto the Ganges.\r\n\r\nWhen the country was groaning under the Afghan yoke, it was the daring\r\nspirit of one from the ranks of the people, Nadir Kuli (Shah), who\r\nconceived the overthrow of the oppressor and the recovery of Persian\r\nindependence. Originally a simple trooper of the Afshar tribe, he\r\nadvanced himself by valour, boldness, and enterprise, and crowned his\r\nsuccesses by winning the admiration of the royal leaders and adherents,\r\nwho on the death of the infant King, Abbas III., son of Shah Tamasp,\r\nelected him to be their King. As such he carried the war into the\r\ncountry of the evicted oppressors, and established the power of the\r\nempire from the Oxus to Delhi, whence he returned with the splendid\r\nspoil which yet enriches and adorns the Crown of Persia. It speaks much\r\nfor Nadir Shah's strong character that, having gained such distinction,\r\nhe did not allow flatterers to find amid the obscurity of his birth the\r\nlost traces of great ancestors. He never boasted a proud genealogy; on\r\nthe contrary, he often spoke of his low birth, and we are told that even\r\nhis flattering historian had to content himself with saying that the\r\ndiamond has its value from its own lustre, and not from the rock in\r\nwhich it grows. A characteristic story of this remarkable man is that\r\non demanding a daughter of his vanquished enemy, Mahmud Shah, the\r\nEmperor of Delhi, in marriage for his son, Nasr-ullah, he was met with\r\nthe answer that for alliance with a Princess of the Imperial house of\r\nTimor a genealogy of seven generations was required. 'Tell him,' said\r\nNadir, 'that Nasr-ullah is the son of Nadir Shah, the son of the sword,\r\nthe grandson of the sword, and so on till they have a descent of\r\nseventy, instead of seven generations.' Nadir, the man of action and\r\nblood and iron, had the greatest contempt for the weak, dissolute Mahmud\r\nShah, who, according to the native historian of the time, was 'never\r\nwithout a mistress in his arms and a glass in his hand,' a debauchee of\r\nthe lowest type, as well as a mere puppet King. In the end the demon of\r\nsuspicion poisoned the mind of Nadir to such an extent that he became\r\nmadly murderous, and assassination ended his life. The Persians say that\r\nhe began as a deliverer and ended as a destroyer.\r\n\r\nAs a people, the Persians are of a happy disposition and bright\r\nimagination, doubtless produced by the dry, clear air of their high\r\ntableland, which relieves from dullness and depression. They enjoy a\r\njoke and laugh heartily, and they are able to see that most things have\r\ntheir comic side. The late Shah was quick to show the merry look of\r\nappreciation when something amusing was said. At the Nauroz Court\r\nreception of the Corps Diplomatique all the Legations, headed by the\r\nTurkish Embassy, were ranged in a semicircle in front of the Shah, and\r\nafter the congratulatory address was delivered by the Sultan's\r\nAmbassador, his Majesty advanced and walked round slowly, pausing to say\r\na few words to each Minister. His face lit up with animation when he\r\nspoke to one whom he knew to be able to reply in the Persian tongue. On\r\none occasion, after speaking with the Ottoman Ambassador, who is always\r\na Persian linguist (Persian being an obligatory subject of qualification\r\nfor the Tehran post), he passed on to a Minister who was a good Persian\r\nscholar. Further on he found an equally well--qualified colloquial\r\nproficient in another; and on finding himself before a well-known very\r\nclever diplomatist for whom he had a great personal liking, he smiled\r\nand said pleasantly, 'Have you learnt any Persian yet?' The Minister\r\nbowed, and, looking duly serious, said in Persian, 'I know something.'\r\nThe Minister meant to say that he knew a little, but the word\r\n'something,' as used, could be taken, as in English, to signify 'a thing\r\nor two.' Such a meaning from the diplomatist who spoke was quite\r\nappropriate, and the Shah laughed softly and looked much amused.\r\n\r\nAs another instance (but in this case of grim humour) of seeing the\r\ncomic side, a Prince Governor of a province, sitting in judgment,\r\nordered a merchant to pay a fine of fifty tomans, but, though well known\r\nto be rich, he protested his utter inability to pay, saying he had never\r\nseen such a sum of money, and begged for some other punishment which the\r\nPrince in his wisdom and mercy would command. His Highness then\r\nsuggested a choice of eating fifty raw onions, or eating fifty sticks\r\n(the Oriental mode of expression when speaking of bastinado strokes), or\r\npaying the fifty tomans. Persians are fond of raw onions, those they eat\r\nbeing small, and the merchant enjoyed the prospect of thus saving his\r\nmoney. He thought that the punishment had been ordered in ignorance, so,\r\nconcealing his feeling of happy surprise, and affecting fear, he\r\nelected for onions. He struggled hard with them, but could not swallow\r\nmore than half the number. He was then asked to pay the fine, but he\r\nclaimed his further choice of the fifty sticks. Triced up, he underwent\r\nthe pain of twenty-five well laid on to the soles of his feet, and then\r\ncalled out that he would willingly pay the fifty tomans to have no more.\r\nOn this he was cast loose, and the Prince said, 'You fool! you had a\r\nchoice of one of three punishments, and you took all three.'\r\n\r\nPersian servants regard their fixed pay as but a retaining fee, and look\r\nfor their real wages in perquisites. They show considerable ingenuity\r\nand brightness of idea in reasons for purchasing this, that, and the\r\nother thing, not really required, but affording opportunities for\r\n'pickings.' A new head-servant, on looking round his master's premises,\r\nand seeing no opening for a fresh purchase, at last cast his eye on the\r\nfowls, kept to secure a supply of fresh eggs, instead of the doubtful\r\nones bought in the bazaar. He introduced stale eggs into the fowl-house,\r\nand on their condition being remarked at breakfast, he gravely explained\r\nthat he had noticed the hens were old, and it sometimes happened that\r\nold hens laid stale eggs, whereas young hens always laid fresh eggs; so\r\nhe suggested clearing out the fowl-house and restocking it with young\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\nThe leisure time the servants have is not always well spent, it is true,\r\nbut they have ideas of imagination and sentiment, which in some degree\r\nis suggestive of refinement. I have seen this shown in their love of\r\nsinging birds, and their dandy ways of dress; for some of them are very\r\nparticular as to the cut of a coat and the fit of a hat. I have\r\nsometimes been interested in seeing them carefully tending their pet\r\nnightingales, cleaning the cages, and decking them out with bits of\r\ncoloured cloth and any flowers in season. In November I saw quite a\r\ndozen cages thus brightened, each with its brisk-looking nightingale\r\noccupant, put out in the sunshine in the courtyard; and on asking about\r\nsuch a collection of cages, was told rather shyly, as if fearing a smile\r\nat their sentimental ways, that there was an afternoon tea that day in\r\nthe neighbourhood, to which the nightingales and their owners were\r\ngoing. These singing-bird-parties are held in the underground rooms of\r\nhouses, which are cool in summer and warm in winter, and I imagine the\r\ncompany and rivalry of a number of birds in the semi-darkness, with\r\nglimmering light from the 'kalian' pipes, and the bubbling of water in\r\nthe pipe-bowls, and the boiling samovar tea-urns, all combine to cheat\r\nthe birds pleasantly into believing that it is night-time in the spring\r\nsong-season.\r\n\r\nThe Persian poets brought the nightingale much into their songs of\r\npraise of earthly joys. The bulbul, of which they wrote and sang, was\r\nthe European nightingale, which visits Persia in spring to sing and love\r\nand nest. They pass as far South as Shiraz, where they meet the plump\r\nlittle Indian bulbul, which is often mistaken for the Shiraz poets'\r\nsinging-bird. The word is applied to both species in India and Persia,\r\nbut the birds are quite different in shape, plumage, and voice. They\r\nmeet at Shiraz, a place which possesses a climate so temperate and\r\nequable as to bring together the birds and fruits of the East and West,\r\nNorth and South; for there I saw and heard the Indian bulbul and the\r\nhoopoe, the European nightingale, the cuckoo, and the magpie, and I know\r\nthat the fruits range from apples to dates.\r\n\r\nThe nightingale is the favourite pet singing-bird of the Persians. I had\r\ngood information regarding the manner of obtaining them for cage\r\npurposes from some small boys who were engaged picking roses in a\r\nrose-garden at Ujjatabod, near Yezd. There are two large rose-gardens in\r\nthat oasis in the Yezd Desert, where the manufacture of rose-water and\r\nthe attar essence is carried on. The gardens are appropriately favourite\r\nhaunts of the nightingales on their return with the season of gladness\r\nfrom their winter resorts in the woods of the Caspian coast. The Persian\r\npoets tell of the passionate love of the nightingale for the scented\r\nrose, and in fanciful figure of speech make the full-blossomed flower\r\ncomplain of too much kissing from its bird-lover, so that its sweetness\r\ngoes, and its beauty fades far too sadly soon. The boys told me of the\r\nnumber of family pairs, their nests and eggs, and said that they took\r\nthe young male birds when fully fledged and about to leave the nest, and\r\nbrought them up by hand at first, till able to feed themselves. There is\r\na great demand in the towns for the young nightingales, which in Persia\r\nsing well in captivity, so rarely the case with the bird in Europe. The\r\nshopkeepers like to have their pet birds by them, and in the nesting\r\nseason they may be heard all over the bazaars, singing sweetly and\r\nlongingly for the partners they know of by instinct, but never meet.\r\n\r\nThere is much pleasing romance and sentiment in the popular idea\r\nregarding the origin of the national emblem, Sher o Khurshed (the Lion\r\nand the Sun). The following legend concerning it was told to me by the\r\nMalik-ut-Tujjar, or Master of the Merchants of Tehran, a gentleman well\r\nversed in Persian history, literature, and lore, and who spoke with all\r\nthe enthusiasm of national pride. When the first monarchy of Ajam\r\n(Persia) was founded by Kai Uramâs, some five thousand years ago, the\r\nsun was in the sign of Asad (Leo), the highest tower in the heavens, and\r\nthe lion was therefore taken as the Persian emblem, and it so remained\r\nwithout the sun over it, as now shown, till about six hundred years ago.\r\nGhazan Khan, who then reigned as King, was so attached to his wife, the\r\nQueen Khurshed (the Sun), that he desired to perpetuate her name by\r\nputting it on the coins he struck; but the Ulema objected to a woman's\r\nname on the King's coin, whereupon he decided to put her face on a\r\nrising sun above the national emblem of the lion, as now seen in the\r\nwell-known royal arms of Persia. The story is that King Ghazan's\r\naffection for his Queen, Khurshed, was such that he styled her Sham'bu\r\nGhazan (the Light of Ghazan).\r\n\r\nThis may have been the origin of the expression Khurshed Kullah, or\r\nSun-crowned, which I have seen stated is a term that was used to denote\r\nthe Sovereign of an empire, but from the fact of the features and style\r\nof dressing the hair shown in the sun-picture being those of a woman, I\r\nthink the title may be regarded as applied only to queens. Catherine II.\r\nof Russia, from the magnificence of her Court, her beauty and ambition,\r\nand her fame in love and war, was known in Persia during her lifetime as\r\nKhurshed Kullah, and she is still designated by that title.\r\n\r\nI would here mention another instance of a Mohammedan monarch desiring\r\nto publish to his people in the most sovereign manner his high regard\r\nfor a wife by putting her name on the current coin. The reign of the\r\nEmperor Jehangir, son of Akbar the Great, the founder of the Moghul\r\nEmpire in India and the builder of Agra, was chiefly remarkable for the\r\ninfluence exercised over him by his favourite wife, Nur Mahal, the Light\r\nof the Harem, immortalized by Moore in 'Lalla Rookh.' The currency was\r\nstruck in her name, and we are also told that in her hands centred all\r\nthe intrigues that make up the work of Oriental administration. She lies\r\nburied by the side of her husband at Lahore, the capital of the Punjab.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Ghazan Khan's succession to the throne of Persia is an\r\nunusually interesting one. He was a Moghul chief of the line of Chengiz\r\nKhan, and, holding Persia in tributary dependence for his sovereign\r\nmaster the Khakan, was at the head of one hundred thousand tried Tartar\r\nwarriors. Persia was then Mohammedan, and the proposal was made to him\r\nto join the new faith, and become the King-elect of an independent Iran.\r\nHe consulted his commanders, and then decided to enter Islam and become\r\nKing. His apostasy was followed by the instant conversion of his hundred\r\nthousand men, who, with the true spirit of Tartar soldiers, followed\r\ntheir leader into the pale of Islam, and soon became the active\r\nsupporters of the faith which they had so suddenly embraced. We can\r\nimagine the triumphant joy of the proselytizing priests as they passed\r\ndown the crowded ranks of the time-hardened, weather-proof warrior sons\r\nof the bow and spear, who on June 17, 1265, paraded at Firozkoh, where\r\nthe Tartar host was then encamped, to repeat the Mohammedan confession\r\nof faith. To them the learning of the Arabic words must have been the\r\nseverest exercise they had ever been called upon to practise, and it is\r\neasy to think of the muttered swearing among the puzzled veterans that\r\nwhat was good enough for their leader was good enough for them, and that\r\nthey were ready to do as he had done, without further talk or ceremony.\r\nIslam was then most actively aggressive, extending by the argument of\r\nsmooth speech or sharp sword, as occasion demanded, and the Moullas must\r\nhave regarded with enthusiastic pride the glorious reinforcement they\r\nhad brought to its armies by the consecration of such a splendid warrior\r\nhost to the service of their Church.\r\n\r\nGhazan Khan was the first of this race of kings from the line of Chengiz\r\nwho threw off all allegiance to Tartary by directing that the name of\r\nthe monarch of that empire should not in future be put on the Persian\r\ncoins. On the coins which he struck, the Mohammedan creed, 'There is no\r\nGod but God, and Mohammed is His Prophet,' was inscribed instead of the\r\nname and titles of the Khakan. He had not the courage of his heart's\r\ndesire to strike his wife's name on the coins, as Jehangir did, but he\r\nwas differently placed, in that, as a fresh convert and a new King by\r\nthe favour of Islam, he felt himself unable to put aside the priests who\r\nhad bribed him with a crown. Malcolm, in remarking on Ghazan Khan's\r\naccession to the throne of Persia, says that Henry IV. of France\r\nsimilarly changed his creed to secure the crown.\r\n\r\nGhazan Khan reigned about the middle of the thirteenth century, and was\r\nknown in Europe for his supposed readiness to assist in re-establishing\r\nthe Christians in the Holy Land. He was deemed a wise and just Prince,\r\nand it is believed that his policy led him to seek the aid of the States\r\nof Europe in order to improve the position and condition of himself and\r\nhis kingdom. It is said that Pope Boniface VIII endeavoured by a display\r\nof his connection with Ghazan Khan to excite the Christian princes to\r\nanother Crusade, and it was probably this connection with the head of\r\nthe Christian Church which led to a general impression among Western\r\nwriters that Ghazan Khan was not sincere in his conversion to\r\nMohammedanism, and was at heart a Christian. There is reason to think\r\nthat the secret spring of his action was to weaken the Egyptian Empire,\r\nwhich he regarded as hostile and dangerous to himself and Persia. It is\r\nnot clear whether Ghazan Khan apostatized from the religion of his\r\nancestors or that of the Christians, but he is believed to have been\r\nattached all his life to the latter faith, though he does not appear to\r\nhave made a public declaration of his belief in its doctrines. He\r\nprofessed Mohammedanism in order to obtain the crown, but his life had\r\nbeen passed in friendship with Christians, and in wars with the\r\nfollowers of the faith he adopted.\r\n\r\nXenophon mentions that the royal emblem of Persia from early times was a\r\ngolden eagle with outstretched wings, resting on a spearhead like the\r\nRoman eagle, but he makes no allusion to a standard. Persian historians\r\ntell of a famous standard carried from the mythical time of Zohâk to\r\nthat of the last of the Pehlevi kings. Their story is that Kawâh, a\r\nblacksmith, raised a successful revolt against the implacably cruel King\r\nZohâk in the earliest time of Persian sovereignty, and relieved the\r\ncountry from his terrible tyranny by putting him to death. The\r\nvictorious blacksmith then placed on the throne Faridûn, a Prince of the\r\nPeshdâdian dynasty, who adopted his apron, which had been the standard\r\nof revolt, as the royal banner of Persia. As such it was said to be\r\nrichly ornamented with jewels, to which every king, from Faridûn\r\nto the last of the Pehlevi monarchs, added. It was called the\r\nDurafsh-i-Kawâh[1] (the Standard of Kawâh), and continued to be the\r\nroyal standard of Persia till the Mohammedan conquest, when it was taken\r\nin battle by Saad-e-Wakass, and sent to the Khalif Omar. Malcolm said\r\nthat the causes which led to the sign of Sol in Leo becoming the arms of\r\nPersia could not be distinctly traced, but thought there was reason to\r\nbelieve that the use of this symbol was not of very great antiquity. He\r\nsaid, with reference to it being upon the coins of one of the Seljukian\r\ndynasty of Iconium, that when this family was destroyed by Halaku,\r\nthe grandson of Chengiz, it was far from improbable that that Prince or\r\nhis successor adopted this emblematical representation as a trophy of\r\nhis conquest, and that it has remained ever since among the most\r\nremarkable of the royal insignia of Persia. He also mentioned the\r\nopinion that this representation of Sol in Leo was first adopted by\r\nGhiat-u-dîn-Kai-Khusru-bin-Kai-Kobad, 1236 A.D., and that the emblem is\r\nsupposed to have reference either to his own horoscope or that of his\r\nQueen, who was a Princess of Georgia. This approaches the legend told by\r\nthe Malik-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, for the face depicted on Sol is that of a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note 1: The original text has Durnfsh-i-Kawâh.

These\r\nofficers were followed by others, who in 1834, under Sir Henry Lyndsay\r\nBethune, led the troops they had trained against the Pretenders who, on\r\nthe death of Fateh Ali Shah, opposed the succession of the Vali Ahd\r\n(heir-apparent), Mohamed Shah, father of the late Sovereign. The\r\nPretenders were defeated by Sir Lyndsay Bethune, and thus England\r\nestablished the stability of the throne of the Kajars in the direct\r\nline, and carried out the will of the great Fateh Ali Shah, who had\r\nappointed his grandson to succeed him after the death of his son, Abbas\r\nMirza. During all the changes since Mohamed Shah's accession, Persia has\r\nalways had reason to regard England as a friendly neighbour who has no\r\naggressive designs against her. This feeling must have become conviction\r\non finding that the defeat she suffered in 1856 caused her no loss of\r\nterritory in the South, and the Order of the Lion and the Sun continues\r\nto be a signal sign of strong friendship between the two nations.\r\n\r\nThere are two great St. Bernard dogs belonging to the British Minister\r\nat Tehran, which, by their leonine appearance and tawny red colour,\r\nmassive forms and large limbs, have made a remarkable impression on the\r\nimaginative Persian mind. They are dogs of long pedigree, being son and\r\ndaughter of two famous class champions. Never being tied up, but\r\nallowed full freedom, they are perfectly quiet and good-natured, though\r\nat first sight, to the nervous, they may look doubtful, if not\r\ndangerous. These powerful giant dogs accompany the Minister's wife in\r\nher walks, and seem to know that they are to guard and protect; showy,\r\ngay Rex precedes, with his head up and eyes all about, while Dido\r\nfollows, with head down, lioness-like, watchful and suspicious. Painful\r\nexperience has taught the street-scavenger curs, which dash savagely at\r\nstrange dogs, to slink away at the sight of this pair of champions, and\r\nthe passers-by, who, as Mohammedans, are merciless to dogs, treat them\r\nas quite different from the dog they despise, so that they walk along\r\nfeared and respected by all, man and dog alike. A Persian gentleman,\r\nriding past with his mounted followers, drew up at the sight of these\r\nSt. Bernards, and said, 'I would give the finest Kerman shawl, or the\r\nvery best Persian horse, for a puppy dog of that breed.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MENDICANT DERVISH OF TEHRAN]\r\n\r\nSome of the mendicant dervishes of Tehran are of wild look, with matted\r\nlocks, and with howling voice go about demanding, not begging, alms.\r\nThey regard a giver as under some obligation to them, for affording him\r\nthe means of observance of a duty imposed by religion. These stalk along\r\ndefiantly, carrying club or axe, and often present a disagreeable\r\nappearance. One of them came suddenly by a side-path behind the\r\nMinister's wife, and followed, yelling out his cry of 'Hakk, hakk!' It\r\nwas almost dark, and he did not see the great dogs, which had gone\r\nahead. His cry and continued close-following steps were disturbing, so I\r\nturned and asked him either to go on at once or keep farther back. He\r\nfrowned at what no doubt he considered my bad taste in objecting to his\r\npleasing and superior presence, and hastened his pace a little to pass,\r\nbut stopped suddenly on seeing the 'lion-dogs' belonging to the\r\nJanâb-i-Khanum-i-Sifarat (the Lady Excellency of the Legation), and\r\nasked to be allowed to follow us, saying he would be perfectly quiet. On\r\nreaching the Legation gate, and seeing his way clear, the dogs having\r\nentered, he left, saying gently, 'Goodnight; God be with you.'\r\n\r\nFormerly a lady could hardly walk about without some little fear of look\r\nor laugh calculated to annoy. This is often the case in a Mohammedan\r\ncountry, the meaning being that the figure and face should be shrouded\r\nand veiled. But in presence of Rex and Dido there is no sign of the\r\nlight look or laugh; on the contrary, there is rather the respectful\r\ngesture of, 'The road is free to thee.' The vivid imagination of the\r\nPersian pictures the group as personifying the Imperial arms, the Lady\r\nwith the Royal guard, the Lion of Iran.\r\n\r\nBefore the warriors of the Mehdi made the term 'dervish' better known,\r\nit was commonly understood to signify a beggar. But though the\r\nderivation is 'before the door,' yet this does not mean begging from\r\ndoor to door. The dervish originally was a disciple who freed himself\r\nfrom all family ties, and set forth without purse or scrip to tell of a\r\nnew faith among a friendly people, and to tarry here or there as a\r\nwelcome guest. In due course he developed into a regular soldier of the\r\nChurch, and as schisms arose and the fires of religious animosities were\r\nkindled, various orders of fighting fanatics, calling themselves\r\ndervishes, sprang into existence. Such were the Ismailis, first known as\r\nthe Hassanis, in Persia, in the eleventh century, similar in character\r\nto the present dervishes of the Soudan. In the more favourable sense of\r\nthe word, the true dervishes of to-day in Persia represent the spiritual\r\nand mystic side of Islam, and there are several orders of such, with\r\nmembers who belong to the highest and wealthiest ranks.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Fateh Ali Shah, the mendicant dervishes, who were then as\r\nnumerous and profligate in Persia as vagrant monks used to be in Spain\r\nand Italy, became such a pest that one of the first acts of his\r\nsuccessor, Mahomed Shah, was to direct that no beggars should be\r\ntolerated except the lame, the sick, and the blind, and that all\r\nable-bodied men appearing in dervish garb were to be seized for military\r\nservice. The profession fell out of fashion then, and there are now\r\ncomparatively few mendicant dervishes to be seen. Those that still wear\r\nthe 'ragged robe' do not all appear to follow the rules of poverty,\r\nself-denial, abstinence, and celibacy. One there was, a negro from\r\n'darkest Africa,' who attached himself as a charity-pensioner to the\r\nBritish Legation in Tehran, and was to be seen in all weathers, snow and\r\nsunshine, fantastically dressed, chattering and chuckling in real Sambo\r\nstyle. He knew that his religious cry of 'Ya Hoo' was characteristic of\r\nhim, and he was always ready to shout it out to the 'Ingleez,' whose\r\ngenerosity he had reason to appreciate. He had a story of being a prince\r\nof fallen fortune, who was kidnapped in Central Africa, traded and\r\nbartered across Arabia, and abandoned in North Persia. He was known as\r\nthe Black Prince. During the cholera epidemic of 1892, he took up his\r\nresidence under some shady chenar-trees of great age, a recognised\r\nresting-place for dervishes, close to the summer-quarters of the English\r\nLegation at Gulhek, in the vicinity of Tehran. One day he sat outside\r\nthe gate and poured forth a pitiable tale of the death of his wife from\r\ncholera during the night, and begged for money to pay for her burial.\r\nHaving made his collection, he disappeared at nightfall, leaving his\r\ndead partner under the chenar-trees, and it was then discovered that he\r\nhad possessed two wives, who called him _agha_, or master, and he had\r\ndeparted with the survivor, leaving the other to be buried by strangers.\r\nAfter that he was known as the Prince of Darkness.\r\n\r\nThe privileged beggars or mendicant dervishes of Tehran are not all of\r\nthe stained, soiled, dust-and-ashes description; some are occasionally\r\nseen presenting a pleasing contrast in washed white garments, and of\r\nneat appearance. There was one such in Tehran, a well-known cheerful old\r\nman, who looked as if he could, in quiet company, tell entertaining\r\nstones, for recitation is adopted by some of these wandering dervishes\r\nas a pleasant means of livelihood, and many of them in the storytelling\r\nart show considerable talent, cultivated taste, and retentive memory.\r\nBut, to be successful, they must be able to indulge in variations of\r\ntheir old stories by the introduction of new incidents which they have\r\nheard or invented. One who is known for good style is always welcomed at\r\nthe many tea-shops and gardens in village and town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DERVISH STORY-TELLER OF TEHRAN]\r\n\r\nIn a most unlikely spot, on a long stretch of sand in the Yezd Desert, I\r\nmet a well-dressed dervish in clean, cool white clothes, who stopped on\r\nperceiving that I was a 'Firanghi,' and, gently swaying his neat\r\ndervish-dole dish, said quietly, 'Charity; alms are as dew-drops from\r\nthe heavens,' a most appropriate speech in the sandy waterless waste.\r\nMembership with the higher dervish orders appears to signify and\r\nconvey something of the character of Freemasonry. I know of one\r\nhighly-placed Persian gentleman who is a dervish, and also of a European\r\ngentleman of Oriental light and learning who has been admitted to the\r\nsame order. A famous Prime Minister of Persia in past time, Haji Mirza\r\nAghasi, was a well-known but rather eccentric dervish. My knowledge of\r\nthis was the means, on one occasion, of averting a disagreeable display\r\nof violence by a gay sort of madcap, the relative of a post-house\r\nmaster, who had attached himself as groom to the stable establishment.\r\nMy smart Armenian servant, who was equally good as groom or table\r\nattendant, had taken off his warm pea-jacket to help in bracing up the\r\nloads on my baggage post-horses, which were to be driven loose at a\r\ncanter, the usual practice when riding post with extra baggage. A\r\npowerful, merry-talking groom, who came forward with the horses, picked\r\nup the jacket and put it on, saying that the morning was cold. And so it\r\nwas, for the month was November. When all was ready for a start, my\r\nservant asked him for the jacket, but the laughing _diwana_, or\r\neccentric fellow, said it was a gift to him, and refused to part with\r\nit. Warm words passed, and I intervened and told him to drop his\r\ndervish ways and give back the jacket. The _diwana_ became excited, and\r\nshouted to all who were standing by that I had called him a dervish, and\r\nhad hurt his feelings badly. I then told him he was hard to please, as\r\nsurely a High Vazir was good enough to be compared with, for was it not\r\ntrue that the famous Haji Mirza Aghasi was of the noble order of\r\ndervishes. He took in slowly what I said, then smiled, and gave back the\r\njacket with a good grace. The Persians have a proverb similar to our own\r\nregarding giving to beggars, '_Avval khesh, baad darvesh_' (First our\r\nown, then the beggar. Charity begins at home).\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Persian horses are small, but very wiry and enduring. In\r\nharness they are also capable of very long journeys in light draught, as\r\nproved in the carriage service between Tehran and Kasvin. The distance\r\nis about ninety-seven miles, divided into six stages. On arriving at one\r\nof these, I found that all the posting horses had been taken by a\r\nRussian Mohammedan merchant who was travelling ahead of me in great\r\nstyle, with five carriages. I had two vehicles, one a carriage for\r\nmyself, and the other a _tarantass_ for my servant and luggage, each\r\ndrawn by three horses. There was considerable traffic on the road then,\r\nand the horses had only a few hours in the stable between 'turns.' It\r\nwas night when I arrived at the post-house, and though anxious to go on,\r\nI had no option but to remain there till the horses should come back\r\nfrom the next stage. On their return, after three hours' rest and a feed\r\nof barley, six took my carriage and waggon to the next post-house,\r\nsixteen miles, where again I found an empty stable, the horses which had\r\ngone with the party ahead of me not having come back. On inquiring\r\njudiciously from the post-house master if the horses which had brought\r\nme from the last stage were able to do another, I was told that with an\r\nhour's rest and an extra feed they would be ready to go on. And they\r\ntravelled the second stage well, showing no signs of distress. These\r\nhorses had done sixteen miles in draught, and sixteen miles in cantering\r\nback to their stable during the evening and night; then thirty-two miles\r\nin draught with me in the morning, and after a short rest were to return\r\nthe same distance to their own stable, all in double-quick time.\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of again seeing what I consider one of the most\r\ninteresting sights in Persia, the stables of his Majesty the Shah. They\r\ncontain the very best blood in Asia, and comprise the pick of the finest\r\nhorses in Arabia, Persia, Kurdistan, Karadagh, Khorasan, and the\r\nTurkoman country, also the choicest home-breds from the horse-farms\r\nbelonging to the late Shah and his sons, the present Shah and the\r\nZil-es-Sultan, all of them great horse fanciers and breeders. The late\r\nShah had three breeding establishments: one in the vicinity of Tehran,\r\nanother near Hamadan, and the third at Maragha, in Azerbaijan, where the\r\npasture is good. In each of these there are said to be about one\r\nthousand mares and foals. There is no part of the establishment of a\r\nmonarch of Persia to which more attention is paid than his horses. They\r\nare always placed under the care of an officer of high rank, who is\r\nstyled Mir Akhor.\r\n\r\nThe Mir Akhor (Master of the Horse), Mohamed Hussein Mirza, a Prince of\r\nroyal blood, shows by his intimate knowledge of the history of each\r\nhorse, and the good condition of all and everything under his care, that\r\nhe loves his charge well. We were first shown the racing-stud, called\r\n_mal-i-shart_ (race-horses), thirteen in number, all in hard condition\r\n(the Persian expression is, 'as hard as marble'), and showing good bone\r\nand much muscle. They were Arabs, but not all imported from Arabia, some\r\nbeing bred from pure stock in the late Shah's establishments. The royal\r\nraces are held at Doshan Tepé, six miles from Tehran, where there is a\r\nsoft sand-soil course, said to be a two-mile one, but the correct\r\nmeasurement is one and a half miles. The Persians breed and train for\r\nlong-distance speed and endurance, and the races at Doshan Tepé are from\r\nthree to nine miles. The Prince pointed out the last winner of the\r\nnine-mile race, saying that he ran it in twenty-five minutes. This horse\r\nwas a well-shaped, warm gray Arab, with black points. He, with a darker\r\ngray and a chestnut, all Arabs of pure breed from Nejd, none of which it\r\nis said can be obtained except by free gift, or rare capture in war,\r\ntook the eye most with their make and shape. All were ridden slowly\r\nround the yard by their 'feather-weight' jockey-boys, dressed in red\r\nracing-jackets and blue breeches, with long, soft leather boots, and\r\ncoloured handkerchiefs bound tightly round their heads in place of\r\ncaps. I think these _shart_ horses in the royal stables, which are\r\nalways kept in galloping-condition, are the outcome of the old days of\r\nflight or fight, when it was necessary to be always prepared for raid,\r\nattack, or treachery, and so often man's best friend in pressing need\r\nwas his horse.\r\n\r\n  'A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!'\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the racing stud came the riding-horses, sixty-two in all:\r\ndeer-like Arabs of the best desert blood of Nejd and Anizah, and others\r\nof a stouter build from the country of the Jaf Kurds; selected\r\ncross-breeds from Persian and Turkish Kurdistan, and bigger-boned\r\nanimals from the Karadagh, the result of a strong strain of good\r\nNorthern blood. There were some long, low, powerful Yamut and other\r\nbreeds from the Turkoman country, and some good-looking active small\r\nhorses from Khorasan. From the Kashkai breeding-grounds near Shiraz were\r\nshown some fine big horses of high quality, also neat, stout mixed\r\nbreeds from the hills and plains of Luristan and Persian Arabistan; and\r\nArabs of the best type, bred from 'blood stock' by the Shah's sons,\r\nalso choice specimens from the royal home farms.\r\n\r\nThree gray Arabs, favourites of the late Shah, were brought out, set off\r\nwith gold collars, and their points were gone over to show how\r\npowerfully safe they were as riding-horses on the hillside and the\r\nplain. One of them was said to be getting too old for good work, but he\r\nwas bursting so with flesh and spirits that he threw out before and let\r\nout behind in such vigorous wide-circling style as to scatter the crowd\r\nof spectators, _gholams_, guards, and grooms. The most powerful and\r\nbest-shaped among the riding-horses, in my opinion, were a Jaf (Kurd)\r\ndappled gray, and two big gray Turkomans, the latter very deep in the\r\ngirth, and distinguished by the long, fine neck so common to their\r\nclass, and rather large but lean heads, showing blood and breeding. The\r\nTurkomans say that the superior size and strength of their horses over\r\nothers are due to the rich grass of their pasturelands, I may conclude\r\nthis short account of the royal stud by mentioning that, as Persia is\r\nessentially a country of horses and horsemen, every foreign Minister on\r\nfirst arrival and presentation to the Shah receives the gift of a horse\r\nfrom his Majesty's stables. All these horses had their tails plaited or\r\ntied up. The Persians never cut a horse's tail, but tie it up, which not\r\nonly improves the animal's appearance, but prevents the tail trailing on\r\nthe ground, or being whisked about when wet or dirty, to the annoyance\r\nof the rider. The tail is only knotted up when the horse is made ready\r\nfor riding, otherwise it remains loose, to be used for flipping off\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nThe stable of the King is deemed one of the most sacred of sanctuaries,\r\nand this usage continues in force to the present time. The stables of\r\nthe foreign Legations are also regarded, by reason of the Ilchi-Envoy\r\nrepresentative sovereign character, as affording a similar asylum, and\r\nin 1890 I was witness to protection being thus claimed in the stable of\r\nthe British Minister. The military tribes of Persia have always regarded\r\nthis sanctuary of the stable with the most superstitious reverence. 'A\r\nhorse,' they say, 'will never bear him to victory by whom it is\r\nviolated.' In a Persian MS. referred to by Malcolm, all the misfortunes\r\nof Nadir Mirza, the grandson of Nadir Shah, are attributed to his having\r\nviolated the honour of the stable by putting to death a person who had\r\ntaken refuge there. The same writer says that the fleeing criminal finds\r\na place of safety at the head of the horse even when tied up in the open\r\nair; the fugitive touches the headstall, and is safe so long as he\r\nremains there. Malcolm again tells us of what is still observed, that it\r\nis not unusual for those of the military tribes who desire to show their\r\nrespect at the funerals of chiefs and soldiers of high reputation to\r\nsend a horse without a rider, but with arms upon the saddle, to swell\r\nthe train of the mourning cavalcade. The favourite charger of the\r\ndeparted warrior, carrying his arms and clothes, accompanies the\r\nprocession; the sheepskin cap he wore is placed on the pommel of his\r\nsaddle; his scarf sash, or _kumarbund,_ is bound round the horse's neck,\r\nand his boots are laid across the saddle. In all this may be seen the\r\norigin of similar customs now followed by the most civilized nations,\r\nand of the regard in which the horse is held as 'the noble animal.'\r\n\r\nThe late Shah had not a single English or European riding-horse in his\r\nstables, nor are any such seen in the country except some from\r\nRussia--heavy, coarse animals, bred in the Don districts, and used for\r\ncarriage purposes. The artillery with the Persian Cossack brigade at\r\nTehran also have a few Russian horses. Nasr-ed-Din had such a high\r\nappreciation of Arab and Eastern horses, of which he was in a position\r\nto get the very best, that he found it difficult to understand what he\r\nconsidered the fancy prices paid in England for racing stock. The story\r\nis told that when he was shown Ormonde at Eaton Hall, in 1889, and was\r\ninformed that £14,000 had been offered for him, he tapped the ground\r\nbriskly with his cane, and said in a vivacious manner: 'What! £14,000\r\noffered for him? Sell him, sell him now to-day. Why, he may be dead\r\nto-morrow.' He would have been astonished to hear that Ormonde\r\nafterwards changed owners at the advanced price of about £30,000.\r\n\r\nIn speaking to two friends, competent judges of such matters, about the\r\nbreeding and training for long-distance races in Persia, and the time in\r\nwhich it was said the nine miles had been run, I found that, while one\r\nthought the time might be reasonably correct, the other was more than\r\ndoubtful. I have since then seen in the _Journal of the United Service\r\nInstitution of India_, 1886, a paper on 'Horse-breeding in Central Asia,\r\ntranslated from the Russian of Kostenko by W.E.G.,' in which the\r\nfollowing details regarding the Kirghiz race-meetings and the pace and\r\nstaying powers of their horses are given. M. Kostenko mentions that the\r\ndetails are taken from an article by M. Garder in the _Voyenni Sbornik_\r\nfor 1875. He says that among the Inner Kirghiz Horde, races for prizes\r\nwere instituted by the Minister of State Domains, beginning with the\r\nyear 1851. On October 4 of the same year a circular course measuring\r\nfour miles was made, and the horses ran five times round it. The winner\r\ndid the 20 miles in 48 minutes and 45 seconds. Commencing with 1853, the\r\nraces were run over a distance of 13-1/3 miles on a circular course, and\r\nof these races detailed information from 1869 was obtained.\r\n\r\nThe greatest speed was recorded on October 2, 1853, when the distance\r\n(13-1/3 miles) was done in 27 minutes and 30 seconds. The longest time,\r\non the other hand, was 39 minutes 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Administration of the State Studs did not credit the\r\ninformation sent from the Horde, so that in 1856 there was sent to the\r\nsitting committee a second mètre, for the speed to be followed on it,\r\nthe circumference of the circle having been previously measured. The\r\npresident of the committee repotted that the measurement of the course\r\nwas correct, except that in every 4 versts (2-2/3 miles) it was out\r\n17-1/2 feet. The deficiency was then made good. Accordingly, on October\r\n2 a trial was held, at which the speed was checked with the aid of the\r\nsecond mètre that had been forwarded, and several watches with\r\nseconds-hands. These showed the 13-1/3 miles run in 31 minutes. Of\r\nnineteen races run over this course, the average time was 33 minutes 40\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 a race was run over another circular course, measuring about\r\n3-1/2 miles, five times round. The mare that won performed the\r\ndistance--about 17 miles--in 48 minutes 45 seconds. In the Kalmak\r\n_uluses_ (groups of nomad tents) of the Astrachan Government, races of\r\n10 miles have been held. The greatest speed recorded was in 1864, viz.,\r\n23 minutes 56 seconds; the longest time was in the same year, viz., 27\r\nminutes. The average time between 1862 and 1865, and 1867 and 1869, was\r\n25 minutes 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe riders in these races are lads of not more than ten or twelve years\r\nof age. They are in no way specially trained, as from early age they are\r\nalways riding, and grow up in good condition for hard exercise. Their\r\nweights range from four to six stone.\r\n\r\nThe Persians are a nation of horsemen still, and most of them can ride\r\nwell. All the migratory tribes breed horses, and such is the habit of\r\nobservation of horses in the country, that, as a rule, a man is known by\r\nhis horse, just as in some parts of England a man is known by his dog.\r\nOwing to the notice thus taken of a man's horse, a party of nomad\r\nbrigands who carried off all my baggage-train in 1890 were discovered\r\nand hunted down. There is a road guard service for all the King's\r\nhighways in Persia, and an annual fixed sum is allowed for its\r\nmaintenance. Officials with influence among the neighbouring nomads farm\r\nthis service on the main roads, and entertain a certain number of\r\n'black-mail' men for each stage from the various tribal sections to keep\r\nwatch and ward. The official who farms the road guard service is held\r\nliable to pay compensation for losses by robbery, and this stimulates\r\nthe energies of all to recover stolen property and to keep the highways\r\nsafe and secure. Incidents of robbery occasionally happen, but, all\r\nthings considered, the system may be said to work fairly well, as\r\ninstanced in the recovery of my baggage.\r\n\r\nI had taken a short-cut over the hills to avoid some miles of circuit by\r\nthe highroad, and on the way I met the relieved Governor of Luristan\r\nreturning to Tehran, with a long train of well-guarded laden mules. Some\r\nlittle distance behind them came three mounted nomads, armed with\r\nMartini-Henry rifles (the common arm now in Persia), and showing\r\nwell-filled cartridge belts. They rode up to me and my party, consisting\r\nof a _gholam_ courier and two servants, all mounted. One of the nomads,\r\nriding a chestnut mare, while examining me intently, dropped a short\r\nstick which he carried, alongside of me, and on dismounting to pick it\r\nup, his mare wheeled round towards me, and I saw that she had lost her\r\nright eye. We passed on, and shortly rejoined the highroad, and when\r\nclose to the next halting stage, a post-boy, driving three loose\r\npost-horses before him, galloped up to say that he had seen my baggage\r\nmules driven off the highroad by five armed nomads. The road guards were\r\ncalled, and on hearing my description of the three men we had met, and\r\nthat one of them was riding a one-eyed chestnut mare, they at once said,\r\n'Kara Beg and his sons are in this,' and rode off to follow the trail.\r\nAlmost all my luggage was recovered that night, and Kara Beg was hunted\r\nhard, and disappeared. He had been suspected of several robberies\r\ncarefully carried out, so that detection was difficult; but in my case\r\nit appeared that he had hung on to the rear of the Luristan Governor's\r\nbaggage without being able to steal anything, and when disappointment\r\nhad made his men sore and reckless, they followed up my mules, which had\r\nno guard, and carried them off. The tribal road guards knew where to\r\nfind him and his men, and soon had most of the plundered property back.\r\nThe recovery was due to identification of his mare.\r\n\r\nThe English national love of sport has lately introduced into Tehran the\r\npopular _gymkhana_, an institution which hails from India, where it is\r\nEnglish enterprise under an Indian name. The British Legation has\r\nstarted this amusement, and it seems to provide energy for many who had\r\nlonged for some fresh outdoor exercise, but could not organize it. Now,\r\nwhen weather permits, there are weekly gatherings for variety races,\r\ntent-pegging, and paper-chases. A very amusing and effective novelty,\r\nwhich I saw there for the first time, was a donkey tug-of-war. This new\r\n'gym' was imported by a sporting young diplomatic secretary, who had\r\nlately arrived from Cairo, where he had seen it in full exercise. Tehran\r\nhas excellent riding-donkeys for hire, well turned out, and attended by\r\nthe usual smart-tongued youth. Eight donkeys, four a side, heading\r\noutwards, all ridden by Europeans, mostly English, were engaged in this\r\nsport. Neither whip nor spur was allowed. The rope was passed along\r\nunder the right arm, and held as each rider thought best. At the word\r\n'_Off!'_ heels were brought into fast play on the donkeys' ribs to make\r\nthem move forward, and the scenes that followed were ludicrous and\r\nexciting. Riders were pulled off backward, and, still hanging on to the\r\nrope, they managed to remount and get again into the pulling line in\r\ntime to drag off someone on the opposite side, who had lost his balance\r\non the sudden 'go' forward from the lessened strain. This amusement was\r\na highly popular one with the laughing spectators.\r\n\r\nOur travelling-party on the outward journey had separated at Tehran, and\r\nI travelled back homeward alone. I left Tehran in the middle of\r\nNovember, and as there had been a heavy fall of snow some days before, I\r\nquite expected to have a cold crossing of the Kharzan Pass over the\r\nElburz range. I did the journey to Kasvin comfortably in a carriage, and\r\nrode thence to Resht in three days. I was unexpectedly fortunate in\r\nfinding that the bright weather had freed the road over the pass from\r\nsnow, and I had a perfect day, with still air, for that part of my ride.\r\n\r\nAbout halfway between Kasvin and Resht the road passes through the\r\nextensive olive-groves of Rudbar, which for many centuries has been the\r\ncentre of a flourishing olive-oil and soap business. There are about\r\nsixty villages in the district engaged in this industry; they possess\r\nfrom eighty to one hundred thousand trees, each yielding on an average\r\nfrom six to nine pounds' weight of fruit a year. The olive as a\r\nfruit-tree has been known in Persia from a comparatively early period,\r\nand it is not surprising to hear the villagers ascribe quite a fabulous\r\nage to some of the old trees, just as in Italy some olives are credited\r\nwith an equally astonishing antiquity.\r\n\r\nTo me it has appeared that the habit the olive has of sending up new\r\nstems from the root of an old trunk--just as the chenar sycamore does in\r\nPersia--may have made the old trees become young again, and thus\r\npresent, to succeeding generations in the villages, the look of the same\r\nold trunks. Messrs. Kousis, Theophylactos and Co., of Baku, have\r\nobtained a concession for pressing and refining olive-oil in this\r\ndistrict, and I observed the buildings which they are erecting for their\r\nbusiness rising on the right bank of the river there.\r\n\r\nNear Rudbar commences the thick growth of various hard-wood trees, which\r\nflourish well in the damp soil of the Caspian slopes and lowlands, and\r\nin November their foliage was surpassingly lovely, with many warm tints,\r\nfrom delicate red to deep russet and shades of shot-green and brown. On\r\nsome of the high, thickly-wooded hills, the different colours ran in\r\nwell-defined belts, showing where particular kinds of trees had found\r\nmost favourable soil, and had grasped it to the exclusion of all others.\r\n\r\nAbout forty miles from the Caspian coast I fell in with rain and\r\nmud--such mud as cannot be realized without being seen. I embarked at\r\nEnzelli on board a small Russian steamer, the _Tehran_, which had taken\r\nthe place of one of the usual large vessels employed on the\r\nmail-service. The sea was rising as I embarked, and I was lucky in\r\ngetting on board before the surf on the bar at the mouth of the lagoon\r\nbecame impassable. The steamer had five hundred tons of iron cargo on\r\nboard, machinery for electric light and other purposes, intended for\r\nTehran, but which could not be landed owing to the rolling sea. It was\r\ntherefore carried back to Baku, a second time within a fortnight, for\r\naccident had prevented it being landed on the previous voyage.\r\n\r\nThere is always this risk of wind and weather preventing landing at\r\nEnzelli. Proposals have been made to remove the bar sufficiently to\r\nallow steamers of eight hundred tons to pass into the lagoon harbour;\r\nbut the expense of doing this, and keeping up dredgers, would be\r\ngreat--too great, it is thought, to allow of any profitable return. The\r\nsame landing difficulties are experienced at Astara and Lenkoran, the\r\nplaces of call between Enzelli and Baku. Should there be any intention\r\nof eventually making a railway from the coast to Kasvin and Hamadan,\r\nthere to meet a line to Baghdad, then it would be the best course in\r\nevery way to connect Resht with Baku by a railway along the coast,\r\npassing through Astara and Lenkoran.\r\n\r\nThe coast country is famous for its rice, which could be extensively\r\ncultivated, and the resources in forest and fishery produce are great.\r\nThere would be considerable local traffic as the country opened up, and\r\nthe through trade in oil from Baku would be a paying one. I believe the\r\nRussians know that it would be cheaper to build a railway along this\r\ncoast-line of about three hundred miles, with such trade capabilities,\r\nthan, in the absence of harbours, to erect breakwaters, make sheltered\r\nanchorages, and dredge navigation channels. For two-thirds of the\r\ndistance the line would lie in Russian territory.\r\n\r\nI met at Enzelli a foreign artist, whose acquaintance I had formed in\r\nTehran, where he made some good pictures of local life and scenery. He\r\nwas loud in his complaints of the elements--the heavy rain and the awful\r\nmud. He had come down the road with a minimum of travelling comforts,\r\nand had been rather miserable. On going off to the mail-boat in the\r\nsteam-launch, he vented his feelings of disgust with Persia by spitting\r\nover the side towards the land, and saying, 'Ach! ach! what a country!\r\n'May I never see it again!' When I reminded him of Tehran and its club,\r\nhe acknowledged that he had enjoyed his stay there, and appreciated the\r\nplace; but the rain and sea of mud at Resht had drowned and smothered\r\nall his pleasant memories of Persia.\r\n\r\nThe voyage to Baku was uneventful. There are two Astaras, one Persian,\r\nthe other Russian, with the frontier stream between them. The steamer\r\nremained part of the night at the former place, and moved in the morning\r\nthree miles to the anchorage opposite the latter. There the Russian\r\nCustoms officers came on board to examine luggage. The first mate of the\r\nsteamer, a Swedish Finn, attended the search proceedings, and became\r\nmuch interested In a rusty pistol which was found in the luggage of one\r\nof the deck passengers. The question arose, Was the pistol loaded? and\r\nhe undertook to find out. He raised the hammer to full cock, and,\r\nplacing the muzzle in his mouth, he blew down the barrel, with his\r\nfinger on the cap nipple, to feel if the air passed through. He naïvely\r\nexplained to me the certainty of this mode of discovering whether a\r\npercussion arm is loaded or not. In this instance the pistol was thought\r\nto be loaded, but it was found to be only choked with rust.\r\n\r\nI had intended to return _viâ_ Constantinople, but on arrival at Baku I\r\nlearnt that the damage done to the railway between Tiflis and Batoum by\r\na storm of unprecedented fury and unusually heavy floods was so extended\r\nand bad as to stop all traffic for a long time. I went to Oujari, a\r\nstation one hundred and sixty miles from Baku, where I was hospitably\r\nentertained by Mr. Andrew Urquhart, a Scotch gentleman, established\r\nthere with a factory and hydraulic presses for the liquorice-root\r\nindustry, and from there I entered into telegraphic communication with\r\nTiflis to ascertain if I could get a carriage to Vladikavkas, so as to\r\njoin the railway and proceed home through Russia. There was such a\r\nnumber of passengers detained at Tiflis, _en route_ to Batoum, and all\r\nanxious to go to Vladikavkas by road, that I found I should have to wait\r\nlong for my turn. Accordingly, after six days' stay with my hospitable\r\nfriend, I went back to Baku and took steamer to Petrovsk, whence I\r\ntravelled by rail to Moscow and St. Petersburg on my way to England\r\n_viâ_ Berlin.\r\n\r\nA great petroleum field is now being developed near Grosnoje, a station\r\non the Petrovsk Vladikavkas railway, north of the main Caucasus range;\r\nand an English company has had the good fortune, after venturing much,\r\nto find the fountain for which they and others have long looked. After\r\ncarrying on 'sounding' operations for some time, and sinking several\r\nwells, oil was at length 'struck' towards the end of August at a depth\r\nof three hundred and fifty feet, and it came up with such force as to\r\nreach a height of five hundred feet above ground. The well was on a\r\nhillside, and the valley below had been dammed up previously to form a\r\nreservoir capable of holding a large supply of oil. But such was the\r\nflow from the fountain, that after a few days it rose above the dam,\r\nand, although every effort was made to raise and strengthen it, the oil\r\noverflowed, and the top of the dyke was carried away. Millions of\r\ngallons were lost, though on its course down the valley the oil\r\ncompletely filled another reservoir, which had been prepared for the oil\r\nof a rival company, but which never came from their own wells.\r\nEventually the main flow of oil found its own level in a low-lying piece\r\nof ground, about four miles below the broken dam.\r\n\r\nAs the fountain continued to flow with almost undiminished vigour, the\r\nGovernor of Grosnoje began to be alarmed at the damage which was being\r\ndone by this deluge of oil, and he therefore placed four hundred\r\nsoldiers at the disposal of the English engineer in charge, and by their\r\norganized labour he was able to repair the dam, so that the flow of oil\r\nwas checked. A friend, from whom I received this account, visited the\r\nplace on November 27, and saw the fountain still playing to a height of\r\ntwenty feet, and also the lake of oil which had been formed. The lake\r\nwas about three hundred and fifty yards long, one hundred and twenty\r\nyards wide, and from fifty to sixty feet deep. The fountain was still\r\nplaying on January 10, but it shortly afterwards ceased to flow. The\r\nsame company had another stroke of luck in again 'striking oil' last\r\nmonth at another spot, some little distance from the original fountain,\r\nwhile, strange to say, none of the other companies engaged in\r\nprospecting for oil there have as yet succeeded in getting so much as a\r\ngallon. All this flow of fortune to the one firm reads very like the\r\nluck of Gilead Beck in the 'Golden Butterfly.'\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens, H.B.M.'s Consul for the consular district of Batoum, shows\r\nin his report for 1894 that the demand for naphtha fuel is increasing in\r\nRussia at such a rate, owing to it being more and more widely adopted\r\nfor railways, steamers, factories, and other undertakings using\r\nsteam-power, that the time appears by no means far distant when the\r\nRussian home market may be in a position to consume in the shape of fuel\r\nalmost the entire output of the wells of the Caspian, and he adds that\r\nprobably the supply will even be insufficient to meet the demand. With\r\nall this in view, the value of the Grosnoje wells, situated as they are\r\non the main line of railway through the heart of Russia, is likely to\r\nprove very great.\r\n\r\nI landed in a heavy snowstorm at Petrovsk on November 30, and found the\r\nwhole country under its winter sheet. Since October 1 all railway fares\r\nand charges in Russia have been greatly reduced, and the policy now\r\nappears to be to encourage travelling and traffic, which must result in\r\na general improvement of the minds and condition of the people.\r\n\r\nRailway travelling in Russia is now much cheaper than in any other\r\ncountry; a through first-class ticket from the Caspian to St.\r\nPetersburg, seventeen hundred miles, is but £4 10s., and the other\r\nclasses are low in proportion. The carriages are comfortable, and the\r\nrefreshment-rooms excellent.\r\n\r\nWith accurate information as to the sailings from Petrovsk to Baku and\r\nEnzelli, one can now go from London to Tehran in fourteen days. This, of\r\ncourse, means steady travelling, frequent changes, a saddle-seat for\r\nabout one hundred miles (which can now be reduced to seventy-five), and\r\nsome previous experience of rough life, so as to reconcile the\r\ntraveller to the poor accommodation afforded in a Persian post-house.\r\nBut the Russian road, now under construction, will soon change the rough\r\nride into a fairly comfortable carriage-drive, with well-provided\r\npost-houses for food and rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION IN PERSIA (1896).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n--Shrine of Shah Abdul Azim\r\n--Death of Nasr-ed-Din Shah\r\n--Jemal-ed-Din in Tehran\r\n--Shiahs and Sunnis\r\n--Islam in Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous shrine and sanctuary of Shah Abdul Azim, about five miles\r\nfrom Tehran, is a very popular place of pilgrimage with the inhabitants\r\nof the town, and its close neighbourhood to the crowded capital makes it\r\na great holiday, as well as religious, resort. This shrine has been\r\nspecially favoured by many sovereigns, and particularly by those of the\r\npresent dynasty. On the Mohammedan special weekly day of prayer and\r\nmosque services, Friday, called Juma, or the day of the congregation,\r\nShah Abdul Azim is visited by great numbers of people.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, May 1, this sanctuary was the scene of one of the saddest\r\nevents which has ever happened in Persia--the murder within its sacred\r\nprecincts of Nasr-ed-Din Shah, a monarch who was about to celebrate the\r\njubilee of a reign which will always be remembered, not only for its\r\nremarkable length, but also for its peaceful character and general\r\npopularity. The proof of this popularity is that Nasr-ed-Din Shah was\r\nable to leave his country on three occasions for visits to Europe, and\r\nreturned each time to receive a welcome from his subjects. This in\r\nitself is unprecedented in Eastern history.\r\n\r\nI little thought when I had the honour of conversing with him in October\r\nlast that it was possible that a King so admired and loved by his\r\npeople, and then looking forward with pride and pleasure to the\r\ncelebration of his approaching jubilee, should perish in their midst by\r\nthe hand of an assassin within five days of the event.\r\n\r\nPassing over what in the early years of his reign, through the\r\nexigencies of the times and the pitfalls of intrigue, led to the\r\nshedding of blood, we see in his later years a reluctance to inflict\r\ncapital or severe punishment which almost amounted to a serious fault.\r\nI remember an instance of this in the case of a notorious highway\r\nrobber, guilty of many murders, who was spared so long, that it was only\r\non the bad effect of leniency becoming prominently dangerous to traders\r\nand travellers that the extreme penalty was sanctioned. I have already\r\nmentioned how the people had learnt to put their trust in the late\r\nShah's desire to protect them against oppressive government in the\r\nprovinces, and how he had made himself popular with the military and\r\nnomad tribes. The crime which has caused his death will undoubtedly be\r\nregarded as sacrilege, both with reference to the life which was taken\r\nand the sanctuary which it violated. And the abhorrence of the crime\r\nwill strengthen what it was intended to end or weaken, viz., the\r\ninfluence and power of the Kajar dynasty. With the impressionable\r\nPersians there will be but one feeling, of shuddering horror that such a\r\nthing could be done by one of their own faith, who was a subject of\r\ntheir Sovereign.\r\n\r\nA criminal of the deepest dye can abide with perfect impunity in the\r\nMohammedan sanctuary, and the tranquillity of this sacred safety, we are\r\ntold, brings reflection and repentance to work the redemption of many\r\nfrom evil ways. Thus we can understand how horror-struck the nation must\r\nbe at the thought of the Shah being mortally wounded while in the pious\r\nact of kneeling in reverence on passing the chain which marks the actual\r\nline where the 'bast' or sanctuary begins.\r\n\r\nThe murder is said to have been prompted by the well-known agitator,\r\nJemal-ed-Din, who, though called an Afghan, is really a native of\r\nHamadan, in Western Persia; but having travelled and resided a short\r\ntime in Afghanistan, the term 'Afghani' was added to his name. He was\r\nwell known in Tehran in 1891 for his vehement and violent public\r\nspeaking against all Western innovations. I have seen it stated that it\r\nwas owing to him the tobacco monopoly was withdrawn, as he had roused\r\nthe Moullas throughout Persia, and wellnigh brought about a revolution.\r\nJemal-ed-Din no doubt took a strong part at Tehran in the agitation, but\r\nhe was in no way such a prominent leader of it as has been represented.\r\nThe sudden introduction of systematic labour and Excise regulations\r\nunder foreign direction, by which it was said a few depots were to\r\ndisplace the numerous retail shops and stalls, at once created a\r\nhostile army of unemployed small owners of hereditary businesses, who\r\nworked on the fears and feelings of the mass of the people. The Moullas\r\nand guild-masters then took the lead, and brought about the cancelment\r\nof the concession. All this I have previously described. It suited well\r\nthe nature of a stormy petrel like Jemal-ed-Din to find himself in\r\nTehran at that time, and he became an inflammatory public orator of the\r\nhottest kind. At first he confined himself to speaking against the\r\ntobacco monopoly and all European enterprise, and on his violent\r\nspeeches being made the subject of some remonstrance, the Shah said that\r\nthe Persians had long enjoyed great liberty of speech, and with them\r\nwords generally took the place of deeds. But this freedom was\r\nmisunderstood by Jemal, who gradually grew bolder, until his\r\nrevolutionary utterances went beyond all endurance. He scarcely veiled\r\nhis contempt for the Crown, and his opinion that all should combine to\r\nrid Persia of the rule of the Shah and the continuance of the Kajar\r\ndynasty. He was warned, but would not listen to reason; he was then\r\narrested, and informed of the decision to deport him from Persia. On the\r\nday of his departure from Tehran under escort, he managed to make his\r\nescape, and took sanctuary in the same shrine of Shah Abdul Azim where\r\nthe Shah was mortally wounded on May 1 by his follower, Mirza Mohamed\r\nReza. Jemal opened negotiations with the Government from his asylum, and\r\nwas finally persuaded to leave Persia quietly. It was said that he\r\nreceived generous treatment in the matter of his leaving, but I am aware\r\nthat he stated he had cause for complaint on this head. We must bear in\r\nmind, however, that he was a hot hater of the Shah, and a thorough\r\n'irreconcilable.' On quitting Persia he went to Constantinople, where he\r\nappeared to be allowed such free expression of disrespect to his\r\nSovereign that the Shah addressed a remonstrance to the Sultan, who\r\nstated in reply that Jemal was leaving for some remote place to employ\r\nhimself in literary work.\r\n\r\nAs a native of Hamadan, Jemal-ed-Din is a Persian subject; he is also of\r\nthe Shiah faith, though it is believed that, in order to make things\r\neasy for himself, he passes as a Sunni where the State religion is of\r\nthat creed. He was well received by the Shah on his visit to Tehran in\r\n1890 as a man of learning and letters, and it is said that he accepted\r\nand enjoyed his hospitality. This, however, did not prevent him plotting\r\nagainst his royal host, and doing his utmost to compass the downfall of\r\nthe Kajar dynasty. He probably saw clearly during his stay in Persia\r\nthen that the Shah's authority rested too strongly in the minds of the\r\npeople, by reason of his long and peaceful reign and mild rule, to give\r\nany hope of a successful revolution during his lifetime. And it may have\r\nbeen in this connection that recourse was had to assassination.\r\n\r\nJemal-ed-Din is credited among Orientals with a powerful energy and will\r\nin working on the enthusiasm of others, and establishing a moral\r\ndespotism over them. His disciple, Mohamed Reza, appears to have\r\nresembled his teacher in reckless disregard of kindness, and\r\ndetermination to render evil for good. In him a willing hand was\r\napparently found to carry out the first part of Jemal-ed-Din's programme\r\nfor the reformation of Persia, but the possibility of madness in the act\r\nof murder was not foreseen. For the horror of the crime has been so\r\nintensified from being committed in the holy shrine of the sainted Shah\r\nAbdul Azim, that its object must be defeated in the most complete\r\nmanner, and the reaction will result in stronger attachment to the\r\nthrone of the Kajars.\r\n\r\nJemal-ed-Din held a brief for the union of Sunni and Shiah, an idea\r\nwhich from time to time has found favour with some advanced leaders of\r\nthe former faith. He spoke of the gain to Islam in sinking their\r\nreligious differences, and joining to form one Church and one creed. He\r\nwas said to be very earnest on this point, and he succeeded in planting\r\nhis opinions in Persia, as shown by the subject being still occasionally\r\ndiscussed. But the idea is entirely of foreign growth, and is generally\r\nintroduced by enthusiasts like Jemal-ed-Din, who have exchanged their\r\nPersian national pride of Church and State for the ambition to see Islam\r\nruling as one power from Constantinople to Pekin. These visionaries fail\r\nto see what thoughtful Persian politicians and Churchmen know well, that\r\nthe Shiah schism has preserved Persia as a nation, for without it the\r\nincentive to popular cohesion would long ago have ceased.\r\n\r\nThe annual Passion-play to commemorate the murder and martyrdom of the\r\nprogeny of Ali, and the solemn fast-days when their assassins are\r\ncursed and reviled, which are observed all over Persia, serve to keep\r\nalive their patriotism and pride of independence, for with the Persians,\r\nreligion and patriotism are synonymous terms. There is probably no\r\ncountry where Church and State are more closely and fortunately bound\r\ntogether than Persia. Had the sovereignty not been Shiah, it would long\r\nago have disappeared between its Sunni neighbours. With them the\r\npersecution of the 'accursed Rafizi,' as they speak of the sect, is the\r\nexercise of a holy duty, and their enslavement by Sunnis is a\r\nmeritorious act, giving the heretics an opportunity of benefiting by\r\nexample, and of rescue from perdition by conversion to the orthodox\r\nfaith. Thus it was that the Hazaras and Shiah inhabitants of the small\r\nprincipalities on the head-waters of the Oxus were sold into Sunni\r\nslavery, and the purchase of the Shiah Circassians in the Turkish\r\nmarkets was justified on the same grounds. The bitter experience of ages\r\nhas taught all Shiahs that, once helplessly at the mercy of the Sunnis,\r\nthere must be absolute submission on all points. This conviction has\r\nburied itself deep in the minds of the Persian people, and they now and\r\nthen are painfully reminded of the savage readiness of their Sunni\r\nneighbours to emphasize the fact.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a bazaar quarrel in Herat between Sunni and Shiah traders grew\r\nto a disturbance, and culminated in some of the latter, Persian\r\nsubjects, being slain and their goods plundered, the Moullas solemnly\r\npronouncing their judgment that it was 'lawful' for Sunnis to take the\r\nlives as well as the property of the heretical Shiahs. The Shah, on the\r\nrepresentation of the Meshed religious authorities, addressed a\r\nremonstrance to the Amir Abdul Rahman Khan, who, being a strong and wise\r\nruler, made reparation. The religious antagonism is very bitter in\r\nAfghanistan, and were it not for the warlike character and good fighting\r\nqualities of the Shiah Kizzilbash tribe at Kabul, their presence at the\r\ncapital would not be tolerated by the bigoted Moullas. The common danger\r\nmakes the Kizzilbashes a united band and dangerous foe, and arms them to\r\nbe always ready to fight for their lives. They have become a power which\r\nit is the policy of the rulers to conciliate, and thus secure their\r\nsupport. But notwithstanding this, the fanatical hatred of the orthodox\r\nSunni, as representing both Church and State, cannot be suppressed. I\r\nwas with General Sir William Mansfield (the late Lord Sandhurst) when\r\nhe, being Commander-in-Chief in India, had a conversation with the Amir\r\nSher Ali of Kabul on general subjects, in the course of which the Amir,\r\nin rather a captious manner, made some sharp remarks on what he called\r\nthe hostile differences in the Christian Church; Sir William rejoined by\r\nreferring to the great division in Islam between Sunni and Shiah, and\r\nasked if there were many of the latter faith at Kabul. A look of\r\ndispleasure passed over Sher Ali's face as, half turning towards his\r\npeople who stood behind him, he said, in a severe tone, 'Yes, there are\r\na few of the dogs there, sons of burnt fathers.'\r\n\r\nThe mutual hatred ever existing with Sunni and Shiah has always worked\r\nagainst very cordial relations between Turkey and Persia, and once\r\ncertainly, in the sixteenth century, the fear of Persia, then actively\r\nhostile on the south-eastern border, benefited Austria and Russia by\r\ndeterring the Turkish Power, in the days of its triumph and strength,\r\nfrom extended aggressive operations north and west of Constantinople.\r\nAccordingly, the reconciliation of Sunni and Shiah has long been a\r\ncardinal point of policy with the Porte. While it appears that Austria\r\nthus benefited in an indirect manner through Turkey's fear of Persia, it\r\nis an interesting coincidence that, from the time the latter extended\r\nher diplomatic relations beyond those with Russia and England, which,\r\nfor a considerable period, were the only Western Powers represented at\r\nthe Shah's Court, Austria has held a prominently friendly position in\r\nPersia. Austrian officers have long been employed in her army, and the\r\nfact of the Emperor Francis Joseph and the late Shah Nasr-ed-Din having\r\nascended their thrones within three months of each other in the same\r\nyear (1848) was regarded by the latter as an association with himself of\r\nthe highest honour and amity. And this brings to my recollection a\r\nmatter connected with the Austrian Legation at Tehran which occurred\r\nafter the deportation of Jemal-ed-Din in 1891. Mohamed Reza, the\r\nmurderer of the late Shah, remained in Tehran, and continued the\r\ntreasonable practices which had been originated by Jemal, even to the\r\nextent of disseminating his revolutionary opinions by means of printed\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nThe press used for printing was a lithographic one, and one of the\r\nMirzas employed by the Austrian Legation having been drawn into Jemal's\r\nsecret society, he was induced to set it up in his own house. The usual\r\ninformer accomplice was found, or offered himself, for the purpose of\r\nbetraying his brethren, and the police became so keen on capture that\r\noblivious of the privilege enjoyed by the employé of a foreign Legation,\r\nthey entered the Mirza's house and arrested him in the act of printing\r\ntreasonable papers from the lithographic press. The Mirza was carried\r\noff to prison before the Minister knew of the occurrence, but, on being\r\ninformed, he promptly made a strong remonstrance against the violation\r\nof international privilege. The fullest satisfaction was at once given;\r\nthe Chief of Police called and apologized, and the prisoner was released\r\nand sent to the Legation.\r\n\r\nThe Minister conducted his own inquiry, and on undeniable proof of the\r\ntruth of what was alleged, he dismissed the Mirza from his post, and\r\nthe Persian authorities were then free to arrest him. The Mirza was kept\r\na prisoner for some time, and was eventually released with Mohamed Reza\r\nand his companions. The Tehran telegram of May 4 tells us that Mohamed\r\nReza continued his old course of public hostility to the Government, and\r\nwas again imprisoned, but once more obtained his release, and was\r\ngranted a pension by the Shah, notwithstanding which he remained\r\ndiscontented, as the 'black-mailer' generally does, greed suggesting\r\nthat the price paid for silence is inadequate. This lenient treatment of\r\nthe conspirators was quite characteristic of the later disposition of\r\nNasr-ed-Din Shah, and his averseness to judicial severity.\r\n\r\nFrom what is now known regarding the Mohammedan revival and Church union\r\ncontemplated by Jemal-ed-Din, it is obvious that the idea of any\r\nconnection between Babism and the crime at Shah Abdul Azim is out of the\r\nquestion, for the Babis of Persia and Jemal-ed-Din's followers have\r\nlittle or nothing in common. I have already told how the former are\r\naverse to violent measures, practise no public preaching, and suffer in\r\nsilence, while the latter we know shout aloud and try to terrorize.\r\n\r\nWhen Nadir Shah accepted the throne, he insisted on the abandonment of\r\nthe Shiah schism and reunion with the Sunni faith, and he went to\r\nextreme lengths in suppressing the unwillingness of the clergy to accept\r\nthe arbitrary decree which he issued in proclaiming his mandate. His\r\nattempt to bridge the great gulf between the hostile creeds entirely\r\nfailed, and the Persians remained Shiahs. Freedom of thought and liberty\r\nof speech are national characteristics and privileges, and with minds\r\nnever thoroughly subjected to severe Church discipline, the people have\r\nbeen ever ready to indulge in free criticisms on religious and other\r\nmatters. They had no desire to study a new religion, even at the command\r\nof their King, and, judging that any change would be irksome, they sided\r\nwith the Moullas, and without display refused to be Sunnis. Nadir's\r\ndevotion to ambition was greater than his love of religion, and his\r\nobject in trying to drive all into one creed was to remove the obstacles\r\nto the progress of his Imperial power among the Sunnis of India,\r\nAfghanistan, Central Asia, and Asia Minor. On issuing his mandate to\r\nform the Shiahs into a new branch of the true faith, he intimated to the\r\nEmperor of Constantinople his high aim at general concord among\r\nMohammedans.\r\n\r\nIslam, as it was forced on Persia, was the faith of foreign conquerors\r\nand oppressors, so it never has had the same considerable influence on\r\nthe people as elsewhere. This, taken with their habits of freedom of\r\nthought and love of romance and poetry, inclined them to champion the\r\nShiah schism, which, on the fall of the Arab power, they adopted for\r\ntheir National Church. I refer to this in connection with what is now\r\nreported of Jemal-ed-Din's relations with the chiefs of the State Church\r\nparty at Constantinople, for in his preachings in Persia there were\r\nclear signs of movement towards a great Mohammedan revival, which was to\r\nrestore Islam to its old dominant position in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION IN PERSIA (1896).\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n--The Shah Mozuffer-ed-Din\r\n--His previous position at Tabriz\r\n--Character and disposition\r\n--His sons\r\n--Accession to the throne\r\n--Previous accessions in the Kajar Dynasty\r\n--Regalia and crown jewels\r\n--Position of the late Shah's two sons,\r\n  Zil-es-Sultan and Naib-es-Sultaneh\r\n--The Sadr Azem (Grand Vazir)\r\n--Prompt action on the death of the late Shah.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the great families of Tartary from whom the chiefs of the royal\r\nKajar tribe claim descent, much importance has always been given to the\r\nbirth of the mother of a candidate for high position. Therefore, in the\r\nchoice of an heir to the throne, Persia, as now represented by the Kajar\r\ndynasty, looks to the claims of the mother as well as the father, and\r\nrequires royal birth on both sides. For this reason Mozuffer-ed-Din\r\nMirza, the second son of the late Shah, his mother being a Kajar\r\nPrincess, was preferred to the first-born, Sultan Masud Mirza, known\r\nas the Zil-es-Sultan. It has been customary with the Kajars to have the\r\nVali Ahd, or Heir-apparent, at a distance from the capital, and for him\r\nto be nominal Governor-General of Azerbaijan, the richest and most\r\nimportant province of Persia. Its capital is Tabriz, a town of\r\nconsiderable commercial prosperity, through its Russian and other\r\nforeign trade connections. The mother of Mozuffer-ed-Din Mirza\r\nmaintained a dignified position of high influence at the Court of the\r\nlate Shah until her death, which took place at Tehran in May, 1892.\r\nDuring the intrigues and disquieting rumours which at one time\r\nprevailed, the strong influence of the mother of Mozuffer-ed-Din Mirza\r\nwas always present to watch over his interests in the Shah's palace, and\r\nwhen she died his friends feared that he had lost his only good\r\nprotector. But the Sadr Azem, then known as the Amin-es-Sultan, rightly\r\ninterpreting the true feelings of the royal father and the people,\r\npromptly filled the vacancy himself, and has now led the nation to act\r\nas executors of the will of the departed Shah in securing the peaceful\r\nsuccession of the heir whom he appointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.I.M. MOZUFFER-ED-DIN SHAH, KAJAR]\r\n\r\nThere has been much speculation regarding the character, abilities, and\r\ndisposition of Mozuffer-ed-Din Shah. I think the general opinion formed\r\nof him by those who have had opportunity of judging is favourable. He is\r\nof kindly disposition, and has pleasing manners, and though prudence has\r\ndemanded that as Heir-apparent he should not take a very active part in\r\npublic affairs, yet there have been occasions on which he showed himself\r\nto be a capable ruler. His position made it absolutely necessary that he\r\nshould avoid all appearance of impatience of subjection to the Central\r\nGovernment, and he showed considerable tact in never giving cause for\r\nsuspicion on this point. He was most successful in keeping clear of\r\neverything that could offend the susceptibilities of his royal father,\r\nand was always regarded as a dutiful son and a loyal subject. His was a\r\nmost difficult position to fill, and the fact that he filled it to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Shah proves that he possesses the qualities of\r\nprudence, patience, and good judgment.\r\n\r\nMozuffer-ed-Din Mirza had with him for a long time as Kaimakam, or\r\nVazir, the well-known Amir-i-Nizam, who was virtually Governor-General\r\nof Azerbaijan, for the Shah held him personally responsible for the\r\nadministration of the province. He was a man of strong character, and\r\nhad great influence in Azerbaijan. His wealth also added to his\r\nimportance, and it was not surprising, perhaps, that he considered\r\nhimself qualified to hold independent opinions. The active resistance to\r\nthe tobacco monopoly was first shown in Tabriz, and he was said to have\r\nencouraged opposition to the wishes of the Central Government. In\r\nconsequence of this the Shah summoned him to Tehran in the end of 1891,\r\nand early in 1892 appointed him to be Governor-General of Kurdistan and\r\nKermanshah, a post which he still holds. On this change taking place,\r\nMozuffer-ed-Din was directed to assume responsible charge of the\r\nNorthern province, and has continued to exercise it till now. The\r\nAmir-i-Nizam was succeeded as Kaimakam by Haji Mirza Abdul Rahim, who\r\nwas formerly Persian Minister at St. Petersburg, and as his predecessor\r\nhad been Minister at Paris for some years, the European experiences of\r\nthese able Vazirs no doubt aided the further education of the Vali Ahd.\r\nThe association of enlightened companions and Ministers gave him\r\nopportunities of gaining knowledge which not only informed him on\r\nmatters of public importance and general interest, but was also\r\ncalculated to prepare him for the position of Sovereign. It has been\r\nsaid of him that he is entirely Russian in his inclinations, and\r\nconsidering his long residence at Tabriz, within view, as it were, of\r\nthe great power of Russia's vast empire, it would be strange if he had\r\nnot been strongly impressed with the vital necessity of securing the\r\ngoodwill of the Czar, and we may feel certain that the advice and\r\nopinions of the two Vazirs I have mentioned were to this effect. But it\r\ndoes not follow that Mozuffer-ed-Din Shah's mind is wholly bent in that\r\none direction. Judging from the present as well as the past, he knows\r\nwell he can believe in England's sincere desire to preserve the same\r\nfriendly relations with him as existed with his father, and that she\r\nwishes to see Persia strong, prosperous, and independent.\r\n\r\nWhile the Amir-i-Nizam was at Tabriz, his energetic management left\r\nnothing for the Prince to do, and as, moreover, a policy of caution\r\ndebarred him from taking a very active part in public affairs, he\r\noccupied himself chiefly with the simple amusements of a country\r\ngentleman. He was greatly interested in his horse-breeding farms\r\nestablished on the fine pasturelands of Maragha, near Lake Urumia, and\r\nmade frequent visits there. He is a good horseman and a keen sportsman\r\nwith gun, rifle, and falcon, just as his father was, and his love of\r\nlife in the open brought him much in contact with the people in a manner\r\nthat developed the good-nature for which he is known. He possesses in a\r\nlarge measure the pleasing characteristics of a nomad chief, and on the\r\ndeparture of the Amir-i-Nizam, his personal qualities, added to the\r\nsympathetic exercise of his duties, made his rule popular.\r\n\r\nWhile his prominent brothers have benefited pecuniarily to a\r\nconsiderable extent by the positions which they hold, the Vali Ahd was\r\ncontent to maintain a miniature Court on a modest scale, keeping up his\r\ndignity in a fitting manner, and showing no desire to amass money. The\r\npeople were aware of this, and respected him for not taking advantage of\r\nhis opportunities to enrich himself as others might have done. More than\r\nonce lately mention has been made in the papers of the large fortune\r\nwhich the Zil-es-Sultan is said to have acquired at Isfahan, and\r\ninvested in foreign securities.\r\n\r\nMention may here be made of the first two sons of Mozuffer-ed-Din Shah.\r\nThe elder is Mohamed Ali Mirza, twenty-four years of age, whose mother\r\nis a daughter of Mirza Taki Khan, Amir-el-Kebir and his wife, who was\r\nthe favourite sister of the late Shah. The second is Malik Mansur, about\r\nfifteen years of age, whose mother is a daughter of Ismail Mirza, a\r\nPrince of the reigning Kajar family. The latter is spoken of as an\r\nengaging and bright-looking youth, and is generally believed to be the\r\nfavourite son. The other sons are not much known nor mentioned as yet,\r\nbut it may be said that the succession in the direct line appears to be\r\nwell assured.\r\n\r\nNaturally the health of the Heir-apparent was a matter of great\r\nconsequence to himself, in the first place in view of his future, and\r\nsecondly to those who desired to see the nomination to the succession\r\nundisturbed, for change would have produced great uncertainty and unrest\r\nthroughout the country. When I visited Tabriz in the end of 1892, there\r\nwere three physicians attached to the Vali Ahd's Court. One was the\r\nHakim Bashi, Mirza Mahmud Khan, a Persian of superior education and\r\nprofessional training, who was in constant attendance on the Prince, and\r\nwith him were associated the English Dr. Adcock (who had then been four\r\nyears in Tabriz, and is still with Mozuffer-ed-Din Shah), and an Italian\r\ndoctor, S. Castaldi, brother of the wife of the Russian Consul-General,\r\nregarding whom I have no late information.\r\n\r\nThe succession of Mozuffer-ed-Din Shah so far has been peaceful,\r\nnotwithstanding the fears of many that opposition would appear in the\r\nSouth. This is the first time with the present dynasty that on the death\r\nof the Shah the Vali Ahd has found no rival in his path. Curzon stated\r\nvery decidedly in his important work on Persia that a contest for the\r\nthrone was most improbable, and his forecast has proved correct.\r\nMozuffer-ed-Din Shah is the fifth Sovereign of the Kajar dynasty, which\r\nwas founded by Agha Mohamed Shah, and I may here remark that the reign\r\nof the late Shah was just within one year of completing a century of\r\nroyal rule shared by only three successive sovereigns of this line, a\r\nnotable fact in an Oriental kingdom.\r\n\r\nFateh Ali Shah succeeded to the throne in 1797, having been appointed\r\nVali Ahd by his uncle, Agha Mohamed Shah, who had no family of his own.\r\nHe was the son of Hussein Kuli Khan (full brother of the Shah),\r\nGovernor-General at Shiraz, and he was there with his father when called\r\nto the throne at Tehran. On the death of Agha Mohamed Shah in camp with\r\nhis army on the Northern frontier, General Sadik Khan, chief of the\r\nShekaki tribe in Azerbaijan, seized the opportunity to gain possession\r\nof the Crown jewels and treasure, and quitted the camp with his men; but\r\nthe rest of the troops marched at the command of the strong Prime\r\nMinister Haji Ibrahim, to the capital, which by his orders was held by\r\nthe Kajar chief, Mirza Mohamed Khan, for the legitimate heir of the\r\nShah. Two competitors for the Crown appeared in the South, in the\r\npersons of Fateh Ali Shah's own father, and a son of Zaki Khan Zend; but\r\nboth, as well as the Shekaki chief who advanced similar claims in the\r\nNorth, and Nadir Mirza, grandson of the great Nadir Shah, who had\r\nentered Khorasan from Afghanistan, and raised the standard of revolt,\r\nwere soon defeated and driven into submission. The Shakaki chief was\r\nable from his possession of the Crown jewels and treasure to make terms\r\nfor pardon and preferment; but he afterwards broke his oath of\r\nallegiance, and rebelled. He was captured and confined in a dungeon,\r\nwhere his life soon ceased.\r\n\r\nFateh Ali Shah died in 1834, and was succeeded by his grandson, Mohamed\r\nShah, son of the capable Abbas Mirza, who predeceased his father. He was\r\nat Tabriz, holding the post of nominal Governor-General of Azerbaijan,\r\nwhich was the customary position assigned to the Vali Abd, when his\r\ngrandfather died, and I have in a previous chapter told of the part\r\ntaken by British officers in defeating the Pretenders, who attempted to\r\ndispute his right to the throne. These Pretenders were his uncles Ali\r\nMirza, the Zil-es-Sultan, and Hussein Ali Mirza, Governor-General at\r\nShiraz, each of whom proclaimed himself King. Fateh Ali Shah died at\r\nIsfahan while on his way to Shiraz to compel the obedience of his son\r\nHussein Ali Mirza, who in expectation of his father's death from age and\r\ninfirmity had decided to withhold payment of revenue to the Crown. The\r\nrebellious son advanced with an army, and took possession of the jewels\r\nand treasure which his father had brought with him; and his brother, the\r\nZil-es-Sultan, seized what had been left at Tehran, but Mohamed Shah\r\nafterwards regained possession of the whole.\r\n\r\nNasr-ed-Din, son and heir-apparent of Mohamed Shah, was present at his\r\npost of Governor-General of Azerbaijan when his father died in Tehran,\r\nand there was an interval of disturbance for the six or seven weeks\r\nwhich passed between the death of the one King and the coronation of the\r\nother. During this period revolution prevailed in the towns, and robbery\r\nand violence in the country. The son of Ali Mirza, the Zil-es-Sultan,\r\nthe Prince-Governor of Tehran, who had disputed the succession of\r\nMohamed Shah, issued forth from his retirement in Kasvin to contest the\r\nCrown with his cousin; but the attempt came to an inglorious end. A\r\nrevolt at Meshed with a similar object also failed, and then Mirza Taki\r\nKhan, Amir-i-Nizam, proceeded successfully to consolidate the power of\r\nNasr-ed-Din Shah, whose long reign, and on the whole good rule, have so\r\naccustomed the people to peace that the old ways of revolution and\r\nrevolt on the death of a Shah have been forgotten and changed.\r\n\r\nThe regalia and Crown jewels of Persia mentioned in these changes of\r\nroyal rule have, by inexplicable good fortune, been preserved from\r\nplunder while in the hands of rebels. The Crown jewels are in great part\r\na portion of the splendid spoil which Nadir Shah obtained in the sack of\r\nDelhi, when it was the capital of the richest empire in the East. On his\r\nassassination near Meshed, the treasury was seized by the troops, and\r\nwhile a considerable share, including the famous Koh-i-Nur diamond,\r\nwhich now adorns the English crown, fell to the Afghans with Nadir's\r\narmy, the greater part, with the Koh-i-Nur companion diamond, known as\r\nthe Darya-i-Nur (Sea of Light), was secured by Persian soldiers, who hid\r\nit all away in Khorasan and the adjoining districts.\r\n\r\nWhen Agha Mohamed Shah found leisure from his wars and work of firmly\r\nestablishing his authority, he turned his attention to the recovery of\r\nNadirs jewels, and proceeded to Meshed, where, by means of cunning and\r\ncruelty, he succeeded in wresting from the plunderers of Nadir's camp,\r\nand others, the rare collection of gems and ornaments now in the royal\r\ntreasury at Tehran. The value of the collection is believed to be very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe singular preservation of the regalia and Crown jewels of Persia from\r\nplunder while they were in the hands of rebels after the death of Agha\r\nMohamed Shah, and again on the death of Fatch Ali Shah, is most\r\nremarkable. A superstitious feeling of fear and respect appears to have\r\nkept them from being lost from the Crown, or it may be that, on the\r\nprinciple of 'safety in numbers,' every one, with a prospective share of\r\nthe plunder in view, was a check on his neighbour against theft of that\r\nwhich they thought belonged to all.\r\n\r\nSultan Masud Mirza, better known as the Zil-es-Sultan, the eldest son of\r\nthe late Shah, has generally been regarded as likely to challenge the\r\nright of his younger brother to the throne. His ambition and overweening\r\nself-confidence combined to make him imprudent in permitting his\r\npartisans to speak aloud of his superior qualifications as a successor\r\nto his father. The late Shah's considerate treatment of him on all\r\noccasions also led him to make ill-judged requests for such extended\r\nrule in the South that his father said Persia was not large enough for\r\ntwo Shahs. I think his idea of a viceroyalty in the South came from\r\nfoolish vanity, and not from any serious thought of semi-independence,\r\nas some who heard him speak on this subject supposed.\r\n\r\nHis father always wrote to him as 'my well-beloved first-born,' and up\r\nto 1888 he allowed him great power and freedom of action. He was fond of\r\n'playing at soldiers,' and he went to work at this amusement with such\r\nenergy and will that he formed a numerous and very efficient army under\r\nwell-trained officers, too good, the Shah thought, to be quite safe.\r\nNasr-ed-Din sent an officer whom he could trust to Isfahan to bring back\r\na true report on the army there; and such was the Zil's self-assurance,\r\nthat he went out of his way to show him everything, and to make the most\r\nof his force.\r\n\r\nThe Shah, on learning all, became jealous or suspicious, and ordered the\r\nreduction of the troops to the moderate limits really required for\r\nprovincial purposes. As affairs then stood, the Zil, with his\r\nwell-appointed army, was master of the situation, but he was constrained\r\nto submit. He singled out the Amin-es-Sultan (now the Sadr Azem) as his\r\nenemy at Court, and regarded him as the strong adviser who influenced\r\nthe Shah. His relations with Tehran then became so strained that the\r\nShah summoned him to his presence to have his wishes clearly explained\r\nto him. The meeting of father and son did not tend to smooth matters,\r\nand the latter, allowing his temper to carry him to extreme lengths,\r\ntendered his resignation of the various governments he held, asking only\r\nto retain the governorship of Isfahan. His request was granted, and from\r\nthat time he made no secret of his enmity to the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years later the Shah restored to him some of the provinces\r\nwhich he had resigned in 1888, and this enabled, him to carry out more\r\nsuccessfully the task which he had set himself, viz., that of amassing\r\nmoney, after his army was broken up. The warlike Bakhtiari tribe form\r\nthe most important part of the military strength under the nominal\r\ncommand of the Zil-es-Sultan, but he alienated them entirely by his\r\ncruel and treacherous murder of their popular chief, Hussein Kuli Khan,\r\nin 1882, and the long imprisonment of his son, the equally popular\r\nIsfendiar Khan. Now that he has promised allegiance to his brother,\r\nMozuffer-ed-Din Shah, we may regard the peace of the South as assured.\r\n\r\nThe Naib-es-Sultaneh, Kamran Mirza, as Minister of War,\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and Governor of Tehran, who was in constant\r\nattendance on his father, was also regarded by foolish partisans as a\r\nlikely successor to the throne, but he himself never entertained the\r\nidea. His position as head of the army gives him no real power--in fact,\r\nit rather takes from his influence as Governor of Tehran; for the\r\nsoldiers look upon him as a costly appendage, for whose pleasures and\r\npalaces their pay is clipped.\r\n\r\nThere is really no standing army, in Persia as we understand such,\r\nexcept the royal guard and the weak Persian Cossack brigade at Tehran.\r\nThe artillery and infantry which do all the garrison work are militia\r\nregiments, embodied for two years at a time. The conditions are one\r\nyear's service to two years' leave, and that they serve under their own\r\nlocal chiefs and officers. The administration of regiments is given to\r\nMinisters, high officials, and others for purposes of emolument or\r\ndistinction, as the case may be. This system gives the influence over\r\nthe troops to those who deal with their pay, and not to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, who is regarded merely as the keeper of the great\r\ngate through which the pay passes after toll is taken. The\r\nNaib-es-Sultaneh, equally with his brother, the Zil-es-Sultan, appears\r\nto have a great dislike to the Prime Minister, whose loyalty to the\r\nSovereign and his heir could not fail to create strong jealousy in high\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI shall now finish with a few remarks on the able and sagacious Sadr\r\nAzem, the Prime Minister, who, by his strong character, resolute will,\r\nand prompt action, has proved his loyalty to the Crown and his fidelity\r\nto the Shah. He became Prime Minister at an unusually early age for such\r\na high position, and this preferment drew upon him the jealousy and envy\r\nof many in such a manner as often to cause him great embarrassment.\r\nThere can be no doubt of his conspicuous energy and talent. His pleasing\r\nmanner and happy disposition attract adherents and gain for him their\r\nbest services. In addition to his personal qualities, he has an\r\nastonishing knowledge of public affairs, which makes him a most valuable\r\nMinister. With the people he is deservedly popular, for not only is he\r\nliberal and kind, but he understands their feelings and can interpret\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIRZA ALI ASGHAR KHAN, SADR AZEM (_From a Photograph by\r\nMessrs. W. and D. Downey_)]\r\n\r\nHe was beside Nasr-ed-Din Shah in the shrine of Shah Abdul Azim when the\r\nassassination took place, and at once brought his Majesty back to the\r\npalace in Tehran. This happened about two o'clock in the afternoon, and\r\nthe Shah breathed his last within four hours afterwards. It appears that\r\nthe Sadr Azem immediately grasped the situation, and put himself in\r\ntelegraphic communication with the Vali Ahd at Tabriz, four hundred\r\nmiles distant. He then summoned all the Ministers, State officials,\r\nmilitary commanders, and the most influential people of the city, to the\r\npalace, and announced the death of the Shah. Under his able guidance,\r\nthe prompt recognition of Mozuffer-ed-Din Mirza as Shah, in accordance\r\nwith the will of his father, was effected.\r\n\r\nThe English and Russian Legations, as representing the two strongest and\r\nchiefly interested European Powers, were immediately informed, and the\r\nMinister of the former, and the Charge d'Affaires of the latter, were\r\ninvited to the palace. On their arrival, the Sadr Azem wired to the Vali\r\nAhd in their presence the allegiance of the whole party who were there\r\nassembled. This was done about four or five hours after the death of\r\nNasr-ed-Din Shah, and the following morning, in consequence of this\r\ndecisive action, Mozuffer-ed-Din was publicly proclaimed Shah of Persia.\r\n\r\nThus the electric telegraph, which Nasr-ed-Din Shah introduced into\r\nPersia, has been the means of helping most materially to save the\r\ncountry from the uncertainty which has hitherto always produced\r\nrevolution and civil war in the interval between the death of one Shah\r\nand the accession of his successor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Persia Revisited, by Thomas Edward Gordon",
