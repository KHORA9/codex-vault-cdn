I do not know how far\r\none is justified in calling it the pivot or the corner-stone of a\r\nprogressive civilization. These terms involve a criticism of metaphors\r\nthat may take us far away from the question in hand. Birth Control is no\r\nnew thing in human experience, and it has been practised in societies of\r\nthe most various types and fortunes. But there can be little doubt that\r\nat the present time it is a test issue between two widely different\r\ninterpretations of the word civilization, and of what is good in life\r\nand conduct. The way in which men and women range themselves in this\r\ncontroversy is more simply and directly indicative of their general\r\nintellectual quality than any other single indication. I do not wish to\r\nimply by this that the people who oppose are more or less intellectual\r\nthan the people who advocate Birth Control, but only that they have\r\nfundamentally contrasted general ideas,--that, mentally, they are\r\nDIFFERENT. Very simple, very complex, very dull and very brilliant\r\npersons may be found in either camp, but all those in either camp have\r\ncertain attitudes in common which they share with one another, and do\r\nnot share with those in the other camp.\r\n\r\nThere have been many definitions of civilization. Civilization is a\r\ncomplexity of countless aspects, and may be validly defined in a great\r\nnumber of relationships. A reader of James Harvey Robinson's MIND IN THE\r\nMAKING will find it very reasonable to define a civilization as a system\r\nof society-making ideas at issue with reality. Just so far as the system\r\nof ideas meets the needs and conditions of survival or is able to\r\nadapt itself to the needs and conditions of survival of the society\r\nit dominates, so far will that society continue and prosper. We are\r\nbeginning to realize that in the past and under different conditions\r\nfrom our own, societies have existed with systems of ideas and with\r\nmethods of thought very widely contrasting with what we should consider\r\nright and sane to-day. The extraordinary neolithic civilizations of the\r\nAmerican continent that flourished before the coming of the Europeans,\r\nseem to have got along with concepts that involved pedantries and\r\ncruelties and a kind of systematic unreason, which find their closest\r\nparallels to-day in the art and writings of certain types of lunatic.\r\nThere are collections of drawings from English and American asylums\r\nextraordinarily parallel in their spirit and quality with the Maya\r\ninscriptions of Central America. Yet these neolithic American societies\r\ngot along for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years, they respected\r\nseed-time and harvest, they bred and they maintained a grotesque and\r\nterrible order. And they produced quite beautiful works of art. Yet\r\ntheir surplus of population was disposed of by an organization of\r\nsacrificial slaughter unparalleled in the records of mankind. Many of\r\nthe institutions that seemed most normal and respectable to them, filled\r\nthe invading Europeans with perplexity and horror.\r\n\r\nWhen we realize clearly this possibility of civilizations being based\r\non very different sets of moral ideas and upon different intellectual\r\nmethods, we are better able to appreciate the profound significance of\r\nthe schism in our modern community, which gives us side by side, honest\r\nand intelligent people who regard Birth Control as something essentially\r\nsweet, sane, clean, desirable and necessary, and others equally honest\r\nand with as good a claim to intelligence who regard it as not merely\r\nunreasonable and unwholesome, but as intolerable and abominable. We are\r\nliving not in a simple and complete civilization, but in a conflict\r\nof at least two civilizations, based on entirely different fundamental\r\nideas, pursuing different methods and with different aims and ends.\r\n\r\nI will call one of these civilizations our Traditional or Authoritative\r\nCivilization. It rests upon the thing that is, and upon the thing that\r\nhas been. It insists upon respect for custom and usage; it discourages\r\ncriticism and enquiry. It is very ancient and conservative, or, going\r\nbeyond conservation, it is reactionary. The vehement hostility of many\r\nCatholic priests and prelates towards new views of human origins, and\r\nnew views of moral questions, has led many careless thinkers to\r\nidentify this old traditional civilization with Christianity, but that\r\nidentification ignores the strongly revolutionary and initiatory\r\nspirit that has always animated Christianity, and is untrue even to the\r\nrealities of orthodox Catholic teaching. The vituperation of individual\r\nCatholics must not be confused with the deliberate doctrines of the\r\nChurch which have, on the whole, been conspicuously cautious and\r\nbalanced and sane in these matters. The ideas and practices of the Old\r\nCivilization are older and more widespread than and not identifiable\r\nwith either Christian or Catholic culture, and it will be a great\r\nmisfortune if the issues between the Old Civilization and the New are\r\nallowed to slip into the deep ruts of religious controversies that are\r\nonly accidentally and intermittently parallel.\r\n\r\nContrasted with the ancient civilization, with the Traditional\r\ndisposition, which accepts institutions and moral values as though they\r\nwere a part of nature, we have what I may call--with an evident bias\r\nin its favour--the civilization of enquiry, of experimental knowledge,\r\nCreative and Progressive Civilization. The first great outbreak of the\r\nspirit of this civilization was in republican Greece; the martyrdom of\r\nSocrates, the fearless Utopianism of Plato, the ambitious encyclopaedism\r\nof Aristotle, mark the dawn of a new courage and a new wilfulness in\r\nhuman affairs. The fear of set limitations, of punitive and restrictive\r\nlaws imposed by Fate upon human life was visibly fading in human minds.\r\nThese names mark the first clear realization that to a large extent, and\r\npossibly to an illimitable extent, man's moral and social life and his\r\ngeneral destiny could be seized upon and controlled by man. But--he\r\nmust have knowledge. Said the Ancient Civilization--and it says it still\r\nthrough a multitude of vigorous voices and harsh repressive acts:\r\n\"Let man learn his duty and obey.\" Says the New Civilization, with\r\never-increasing confidence: \"Let man know, and trust him.\"\r\n\r\nFor long ages, the Old Civilization kept the New subordinate, apologetic\r\nand ineffective, but for the last two centuries, the New has fought its\r\nway to a position of contentious equality. The two go on side by side,\r\njostling upon a thousand issues. The world changes, the conditions of\r\nlife change rapidly, through that development of organized science which\r\nis the natural method of the New Civilization. The old tradition demands\r\nthat national loyalties and ancient belligerence should continue. The\r\nnew has produced means of communication that break down the pens and\r\nseparations of human life upon which nationalist emotion depends. The\r\nold tradition insists upon its ancient blood-letting of war; the new\r\nknowledge carries that war to undreamt of levels of destruction. The\r\nancient system needed an unrestricted breeding to meet the normal\r\nwaste of life through war, pestilence, and a multitude of hitherto\r\nunpreventable diseases. The new knowledge sweeps away the venerable\r\nchecks of pestilence and disease, and confronts us with the congestions\r\nand explosive dangers of an over-populated world. The old tradition\r\ndemands a special prolific class doomed to labor and subservience; the\r\nnew points to mechanism and to scientific organization as a means of\r\nescape from this immemorial subjugation. Upon every main issue in life,\r\nthere is this quarrel between the method of submission and the method\r\nof knowledge. More and more do men of science and intelligent people\r\ngenerally realize the hopelessness of pouring new wine into old bottles.\r\nMore and more clearly do they grasp the significance of the Great\r\nTeacher's parable.\r\n\r\nThe New Civilization is saying to the Old now: \"We cannot go on making\r\npower for you to spend upon international conflict. You must stop waving\r\nflags and bandying insults. You must organize the Peace of the World;\r\nyou must subdue yourselves to the Federation of all mankind. And we\r\ncannot go on giving you health, freedom, enlargement, limitless wealth,\r\nif all our gifts to you are to be swamped by an indiscriminate torrent\r\nof progeny. We want fewer and better children who can be reared up to\r\ntheir full possibilities in unencumbered homes, and we cannot make the\r\nsocial life and the world-peace we are determined to make, with the\r\nill-bred, ill-trained swarms of inferior citizens that you inflict upon\r\nus.\" And there at the passionate and crucial question, this essential\r\nand fundamental question, whether procreation is still to be a\r\nsuperstitious and often disastrous mystery, undertaken in fear and\r\nignorance, reluctantly and under the sway of blind desires, or whether\r\nit is to become a deliberate creative act, the two civilizations join\r\nissue now. It is a conflict from which it is almost impossible to\r\nabstain. Our acts, our way of living, our social tolerance, our very\r\nsilences will count in this crucial decision between the old and the\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nIn a plain and lucid style without any emotional appeals, Mrs. Margaret\r\nSanger sets out the case of the new order against the old. There have\r\nbeen several able books published recently upon the question of Birth\r\nControl, from the point of view of a woman's personal life, and from the\r\npoint of view of married happiness, but I do not think there has been\r\nany book as yet, popularly accessible, which presents this matter from\r\nthe point of view of the public good, and as a necessary step to the\r\nfurther improvement of human life as a whole. I am inclined to think\r\nthat there has hitherto been rather too much personal emotion spent upon\r\nthis business and far too little attention given to its broader aspects.\r\nMrs. Sanger with her extraordinary breadth of outlook and the real\r\nscientific quality of her mind, has now redressed the balance. She\r\nhas lifted this question from out of the warm atmosphere of troubled\r\ndomesticity in which it has hitherto been discussed, to its proper level\r\nof a predominantly important human affair.\r\n\r\nH.G. Wells\r\n\r\nEaston Glebe, Dunmow,\r\n\r\nEssex., England\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIVOT OF CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I: A New Truth Emerges\r\n\r\n         Be not ashamed, women, your privilege encloses the\r\n             rest, and is the exit of the rest,\r\n         You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of\r\n             the soul.\r\n\r\n         --Walt Whitman\r\n\r\nThis book aims to be neither the first word on the tangled problems of\r\nhuman society to-day, nor the last. My aim has been to emphasize, by the\r\nuse of concrete and challenging examples and neglected facts, the\r\nneed of a new approach to individual and social problems. Its central\r\nchallenge is that civilization, in any true sense of the word, is based\r\nupon the control and guidance of the great natural instinct of Sex.\r\nMastery of this force is possible only through the instrument of Birth\r\nControl.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that in the following pages I have rushed in\r\nwhere academic scholars have feared to tread, and that as an active\r\npropagandist I am lacking in the scholarship and documentary preparation\r\nto undertake such a stupendous task. My only defense is that, from my\r\npoint of view at least, too many are already studying and investigating\r\nsocial problems from without, with a sort of Olympian detachment. And on\r\nthe other hand, too few of those who are engaged in this endless war for\r\nhuman betterment have found the time to give to the world those truths\r\nnot always hidden but practically unquarried, which may be secured only\r\nafter years of active service.\r\n\r\nOf late, we have been treated to accounts written by well-meaning ladies\r\nand gentlemen who have assumed clever disguises and have gone out to\r\nwork--for a week or a month--among the proletariat. But can we thus\r\nlearn anything new of the fundamental problems of working men, working\r\nwomen, working children? Something, perhaps, but not those great central\r\nproblems of Hunger and Sex. We have been told that only those who\r\nthemselves have suffered the pangs of starvation can truly understand\r\nHunger. You might come into the closest contact with a starving man;\r\nyet, if you were yourself well-fed, no amount of sympathy could give you\r\nactual insight into the psychology of his suffering. This suggests an\r\nobjective and a subjective approach to all social problems. Whatever the\r\nweakness of the subjective (or, if you prefer, the feminine) approach,\r\nit has at least the virtue that its conclusions are tested by\r\nexperience. Observation of facts about you, intimate subjective\r\nreaction to such facts, generate in your mind certain fundamental\r\nconvictions,--truths you can ignore no more than you can ignore such\r\ntruths as come as the fruit of bitter but valuable personal experience.\r\n\r\nRegarding myself, I may say that my experience in the course of the\r\npast twelve or fifteen years has been of a type to force upon me certain\r\nconvictions that demand expression. For years I had believed that the\r\nsolution of all our troubles was to be found in well-defined programmes\r\nof political and legislative action. At first, I concentrated my whole\r\nattention upon these, only to discover that politicians and law-makers\r\nare just as confused and as much at a loss in solving fundamental\r\nproblems as anyone else. And I am speaking here not so much of the\r\ncorrupt and ignorant politician as of those idealists and reformers who\r\nthink that by the ballot society may be led to an earthly paradise. They\r\nmay honestly desire and intend to do great things. They may positively\r\nglow--before election--with enthusiasm at the prospect they imagine\r\npolitical victory may open to them. Time after time, I was struck by the\r\nchange in their attitude after the briefest enjoyment of this illusory\r\npower. Men are elected during some wave of reform, let us say, elected\r\nto legislate into practical working existence some great ideal. They\r\nwant to do big things; but a short time in office is enough to show the\r\npolitical idealist that he can accomplish nothing, that his reform\r\nmust be debased and dragged into the dust, so that even if it becomes\r\nenacted, it may be not merely of no benefit, but a positive evil. It\r\nis scarcely necessary to emphasize this point. It is an accepted\r\ncommonplace of American politics. So much of life, so large a part of\r\nall our social problems, moreover, remains untouched by political and\r\nlegislative action. This is an old truth too often ignored by those who\r\nplan political campaigns upon the most superficial knowledge of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nMy own eyes were opened to the limitations of political action when, as\r\nan organizer for a political group in New York, I attended by chance\r\na meeting of women laundry-workers who were on strike. We believed\r\nwe could help these women with a legislative measure and asked their\r\nsupport. \"Oh! that stuff!\" exclaimed one of these women. \"Don't you know\r\nthat we women might be dead and buried if we waited for politicians and\r\nlawmakers to right our wrongs?\" This set me to thinking--not merely of\r\nthe immediate problem--but to asking myself how much any male politician\r\ncould understand of the wrongs inflicted upon poor working women.\r\n\r\nI threw the weight of my study and activity into the economic and\r\nindustrial struggle. Here I discovered men and women fired with the\r\nglorious vision of a new world, of a proletarian world emancipated, a\r\nUtopian world,--it glowed in romantic colours for the majority of those\r\nwith whom I came in closest contact. The next step, the immediate step,\r\nwas another matter, less romantic and too often less encouraging. In\r\ntheir ardor, some of the labor leaders of that period almost convinced\r\nus that the millennium was just around the corner. Those were the\r\npre-war days of dramatic strikes. But even when most under the spell\r\nof the new vision, the sight of the overburdened wives of the strikers,\r\nwith their puny babies and their broods of under-fed children, made us\r\nstop and think of a neglected factor in the march toward our earthly\r\nparadise. It was well enough to ask the poor men workers to carry on the\r\nbattle against economic injustice. But what results could be expected\r\nwhen they were forced in addition to carry the burden of their\r\never-growing families? This question loomed large to those of us who\r\ncame into intimate contact with the women and children. We saw that in\r\nthe final analysis the real burden of economic and industrial warfare\r\nwas thrust upon the frail, all-too-frail shoulders of the children,\r\nthe very babies--the coming generation. In their wan faces, in their\r\nundernourished bodies, would be indelibly written the bitter defeat of\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\nThe eloquence of those who led the underpaid and half-starved workers\r\ncould no longer, for me, at least, ring with conviction. Something\r\nmore than the purely economic interpretation was involved. The bitter\r\nstruggle for bread, for a home and material comfort, was but one phase\r\nof the problem. There was another phase, perhaps even more fundamental,\r\nthat had been absolutely neglected by the adherents of the new dogmas.\r\nThat other phase was the driving power of instinct, a power uncontrolled\r\nand unnoticed. The great fundamental instinct of sex was expressing\r\nitself in these ever-growing broods, in the prosperity of the slum\r\nmidwife and her colleague the slum undertaker. In spite of all my\r\nsympathy with the dream of liberated Labor, I was driven to ask whether\r\nthis urging power of sex, this deep instinct, was not at least partially\r\nresponsible, along with industrial injustice, for the widespread misery\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nTo find an answer to this problem which at that point in my experience\r\nI could not solve, I determined to study conditions in Europe. Perhaps\r\nthere I might discover a new approach, a great illumination. Just before\r\nthe outbreak of the war, I visited France, Spain, Germany and Great\r\nBritain. Everywhere I found the same dogmas and prejudices among labor\r\nleaders, the same intense but limited vision, the same insistence upon\r\nthe purely economic phases of human nature, the same belief that if the\r\nproblem of hunger were solved, the question of the women and children\r\nwould take care of itself. In this attitude I discovered, then, what\r\nseemed to me to be purely masculine reasoning; and because it was purely\r\nmasculine, it could at best be but half true. Feminine insight must be\r\nbrought to bear on all questions; and here, it struck me, the fallacy\r\nof the masculine, the all-too-masculine, was brutally exposed. I was\r\nencouraged and strengthened in this attitude by the support of certain\r\nleaders who had studied human nature and who had reached the same\r\nconclusion: that civilization could not solve the problem of Hunger\r\nuntil it recognized the titanic strength of the sexual instinct. In\r\nSpain, I found that Lorenzo Portet, who was carrying on the work of the\r\nmartyred Francisco Ferrer, had reached this same conclusion. In Italy,\r\nEnrico Malatesta, the valiant leader who was after the war to play\r\nso dramatic a role, was likewise combating the current dogma of the\r\northodox Socialists. In Berlin, Rudolph Rocker was engaged in the\r\nthankless task of puncturing the articles of faith of the orthodox\r\nMarxian religion. It is quite needless to add that these men who had\r\nprobed beneath the surface of the problem and had diagnosed so much more\r\ncompletely the complex malady of contemporary society were intensely\r\ndisliked by the superficial theorists of the neo-Marxian School.\r\n\r\nThe gospel of Marx had, however, been too long and too thoroughly\r\ninculcated into the minds of millions of workers in Europe, to be\r\ndiscarded. It is a flattering doctrine, since it teaches the laborer\r\nthat all the fault is with someone else, that he is the victim of\r\ncircumstances, and not even a partner in the creation of his own and his\r\nchild's misery. Not without significance was the additional discovery\r\nthat I made. I found that the Marxian influence tended to lead workers\r\nto believe that, irrespective of the health of the poor mothers, the\r\nearning capacity of the wage-earning fathers, or the upbringing of\r\nthe children, increase of the proletarian family was a benefit, not\r\na detriment to the revolutionary movement. The greater the number of\r\nhungry mouths, the emptier the stomachs, the more quickly would the\r\n\"Class War\" be precipitated. The greater the increase in population\r\namong the proletariat, the greater the incentive to revolution. This\r\nmay not be sound Marxian theory; but it is the manner in which it is\r\npopularly accepted. It is the popular belief, wherever the Marxian\r\ninfluence is strong. This I found especially in England and Scotland. In\r\nspeaking to groups of dockworkers on strike in Glasgow, and before the\r\ncommunist and co-operative guilds throughout England, I discovered\r\na prevailing opposition to the recognition of sex as a factor in the\r\nperpetuation of poverty. The leaders and theorists were immovable in\r\ntheir opposition. But when once I succeeded in breaking through the\r\nsurface opposition of the rank and file of the workers, I found that\r\nthey were willing to recognize the power of this neglected factor in\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nSo central, so fundamental in the life of every man and woman is this\r\nproblem that they need be taught no elaborate or imposing theory to\r\nexplain their troubles. To approach their problems by the avenue of sex\r\nand reproduction is to reveal at once their fundamental relations to the\r\nwhole economic and biological structure of society. Their interest is\r\nimmediately and completely awakened. But always, as I soon discovered,\r\nthe ideas and habits of thought of these submerged masses have been\r\nformed through the Press, the Church, through political institutions,\r\nall of which had built up a conspiracy of silence around a subject\r\nthat is of no less vital importance than that of Hunger. A great wall\r\nseparates the masses from those imperative truths that must be known\r\nand flung wide if civilization is to be saved. As currently constituted,\r\nChurch, Press, Education seem to-day organized to exploit the ignorance\r\nand the prejudices of the masses, rather than to light their way to\r\nself-salvation.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation in 1914, when I returned to America, determined,\r\nsince the exclusively masculine point of view had dominated too long,\r\nthat the other half of the truth should be made known. The Birth\r\nControl movement was launched because it was in this form that the\r\nwhole relation of woman and child--eternal emblem of the future of\r\nsociety--could be more effectively dramatized. The amazing growth\r\nof this movement dates from the moment when in my home a small group\r\norganized the first Birth Control League. Since then we have been\r\ncriticized for our choice of the term \"Birth Control\" to express\r\nthe idea of modern scientific contraception. I have yet to hear\r\nany criticism of this term that is not based upon some false and\r\nhypocritical sense of modesty, or that does not arise out of a\r\nsemi-prurient misunderstanding of its aim. On the other hand: nothing\r\nbetter expresses the idea of purposive, responsible, and self-directed\r\nguidance of the reproductive powers.\r\n\r\nThose critics who condemn Birth Control as a negative, destructive\r\nidea, concerned only with self-gratification, might profitably open\r\nthe nearest dictionary for a definition of \"control.\" There they would\r\ndiscover that the verb \"control\" means to exercise a directing, guiding,\r\nor restraining influence;--to direct, to regulate, to counteract.\r\nControl is guidance, direction, foresight. It implies intelligence,\r\nforethought and responsibility. They will find in the Standard\r\nDictionary a quotation from Lecky to the effect that, \"The greatest of\r\nall evils in politics is power without control.\" In what phase of life\r\nis not \"power without control\" an evil? Birth Control, therefore, means\r\nnot merely the limitation of births, but the application of intelligent\r\nguidance over the reproductive power. It means the substitution of\r\nreason and intelligence for the blind play of instinct.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Birth Control\" had the immense practical advantage of\r\ncompressing into two short words the answer to the inarticulate demands\r\nof millions of men and women in all countries. At the time this slogan\r\nwas formulated, I had not yet come to the complete realization of the\r\ngreat truth that had been thus crystallized. It was the response to the\r\noverwhelming, heart-breaking appeals that came by every mail for aid\r\nand advice, which revealed a great truth that lay dormant, a truth that\r\nseemed to spring into full vitality almost over night--that could never\r\nagain be crushed to earth!\r\n\r\nNor could I then have realized the number and the power of the enemies\r\nwho were to be aroused into activity by this idea. So completely was I\r\ndominated by this conviction of the efficacy of \"control,\" that I could\r\nnot until later realize the extent of the sacrifices that were to be\r\nexacted of me and of those who supported my campaign. The very idea\r\nof Birth Control resurrected the spirit of the witch-hunters of Salem.\r\nCould they have usurped the power, they would have burned us at the\r\nstake. Lacking that power, they used the weapon of suppression, and\r\ninvoked medieval statutes to send us to jail. These tactics had an\r\neffect the very opposite to that intended. They demonstrated the\r\nvitality of the idea of Birth Control, and acted as counter-irritant on\r\nthe actively intelligent sections of the American community. Nor was the\r\ninterest aroused confined merely to America. The neo-Malthusian movement\r\nin Great Britain with its history of undaunted bravery, came to our\r\nsupport; and I had the comfort of knowing that the finest minds of\r\nEngland did not hesitate a moment in the expression of their sympathy\r\nand support.\r\n\r\nIn America, on the other hand, I found from the beginning until very\r\nrecently that the so-called intellectuals exhibited a curious and almost\r\ninexplicable reticence in supporting Birth Control. They even hesitated\r\nto voice any public protest against the campaign to crush us which was\r\ninaugurated and sustained by the most reactionary and sinister forces in\r\nAmerican life. It was not inertia or any lack of interest on the part\r\nof the masses that stood in our way. It was the indifference of the\r\nintellectual leaders.\r\n\r\nWriters, teachers, ministers, editors, who form a class dictating, if\r\nnot creating, public opinion, are, in this country, singularly inhibited\r\nor unconscious of their true function in the community. One of their\r\nfirst duties, it is certain, should be to champion the constitutional\r\nright of free speech and free press, to welcome any idea that tends to\r\nawaken the critical attention of the great American public. But those\r\nwho reveal themselves as fully cognizant of this public duty are in\r\nthe minority, and must possess more than average courage to survive the\r\nenmity such an attitude provokes.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief aims of the present volume is to stimulate American\r\nintellectuals to abandon the mental habits which prevent them from\r\nseeing human nature as a whole, instead of as something that can be\r\npigeonholed into various compartments or classes. Birth Control affords\r\nan approach to the study of humanity because it cuts through\r\nthe limitations of current methods. It is economic, biological,\r\npsychological and spiritual in its aspects. It awakens the vision of\r\nmankind moving and changing, of humanity growing and developing, coming\r\nto fruition, of a race creative, flowering into beautiful expression\r\nthrough talent and genius.\r\n\r\nAs a social programme, Birth Control is not merely concerned with\r\npopulation questions. In this respect, it is a distinct step in advance\r\nof earlier Malthusian doctrines, which concerned themselves chiefly with\r\neconomics and population. Birth Control concerns itself with the spirit\r\nno less than the body. It looks for the liberation of the spirit of\r\nwoman and through woman of the child. To-day motherhood is wasted,\r\npenalized, tortured. Children brought into the world by unwilling mothers\r\nsuffer an initial handicap that cannot be measured by cold statistics.\r\nTheir lives are blighted from the start. To substantiate this fact, I\r\nhave chosen to present the conclusions of reports on Child Labor and\r\nrecords of defect and delinquency published by organizations with no\r\nbias in favour of Birth Control. The evidence is before us. It crowds in\r\nupon us from all sides. But prior to this new approach, no attempt had\r\nbeen made to correlate the effects of the blind and irresponsible play\r\nof the sexual instinct with its deep-rooted causes.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the educator and the intellectual creator of public opinion\r\nis, in this connection, of the greatest importance. For centuries\r\nofficial moralists, priests, clergymen and teachers, statesmen and\r\npoliticians have preached the doctrine of glorious and divine fertility.\r\nTo-day, we are confronted with the world-wide spectacle of the\r\nrealization of this doctrine. It is not without significance that the\r\nmoron and the imbecile set the pace in living up to this teaching,\r\nand that the intellectuals, the educators, the archbishops, bishops,\r\npriests, who are most insistent on it, are the staunchest adherents in\r\ntheir own lives of celibacy and non-fertility. It is time to point out\r\nto the champions of unceasing and indiscriminate fertility the results\r\nof their teaching.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties in giving to the public a book of this\r\ntype is the impossibility of keeping pace with the events and changes of\r\na movement that is now, throughout the world, striking root and growing.\r\nThe changed attitude of the American Press indicates that enlightened\r\npublic opinion no longer tolerates a policy of silence upon a question\r\nof the most vital importance. Almost simultaneously in England and\r\nAmerica, two incidents have broken through the prejudice and the guarded\r\nsilence of centuries. At the church Congress in Birmingham, October 12,\r\n1921, Lord Dawson, the king's physician, in criticizing the report of\r\nthe Lambeth Conference concerning Birth Control, delivered an address\r\ndefending this practice. Of such bravery and eloquence that it could\r\nnot be ignored, this address electrified the entire British public. It\r\naroused a storm of abuse, and yet succeeded, as no propaganda could, in\r\nmobilizing the forces of progress and intelligence in the support of the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nJust one month later, the First American Birth Control Conference\r\nculminated in a significant and dramatic incident. At the close of the\r\nconference a mass meeting was scheduled in the Town Hall, New York City,\r\nto discuss the morality of Birth Control. Mr. Harold Cox, editor of the\r\nEdinburgh Review, who had come to New York to attend the conference, was\r\nto lead the discussion. It seemed only natural for us to call\r\ntogether scientists, educators, members of the medical profession,\r\nand theologians of all denominations, to ask their opinion upon this\r\nuncertain and important phase of the controversy. Letters were sent to\r\neminent men and women in different parts of the world. In this letter we\r\nasked the following questions:--\r\n\r\n1. Is over-population a menace to the peace of the world?\r\n\r\n2. Would the legal dissemination of scientific Birth Control\r\ninformation, through the medium of clinics by the medical profession, be\r\nthe most logical method of checking the problem of over-population?\r\n\r\n3. Would knowledge of Birth Control change the moral attitude of men\r\nand women toward the marriage bond, or lower the moral standards of the\r\nyouth of the country?\r\n\r\n4. Do you believe that knowledge which enables parents to limit their\r\nfamilies will make for human happiness, and raise the moral, social and\r\nintellectual standards of population?\r\n\r\nWe sent this questionnaire not only to those who we thought might agree\r\nwith us, but we sent it also to our known opponents.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the Town Hall the entrance was guarded by policemen.\r\nThey told me there would be no meeting. Before my arrival our executives\r\nhad been greeted by Monsignor Dineen, secretary of Archbishop Hayes, of\r\nthe Roman Catholic archdiocese, who informed them that the meeting would\r\nbe prohibited on the ground that it was contrary to public morals. The\r\npolice had closed the doors. When they opened them to permit the exit\r\nof the large audience which had gathered, Mr. Cox and I entered. I\r\nattempted to exercise my constitutional right of free speech, but was\r\nprohibited and arrested. Miss Mary Winsor, who protested against this\r\nunwarranted arrest, was likewise dragged off to the police station. The\r\ncase was dismissed the following morning. The ecclesiastic instigators\r\nof the affair were conspicuous by their absence from the police court.\r\nBut the incident was enough to expose the opponents of Birth Control and\r\nthe extreme methods they used to combat our progress. The case was too\r\nflagrant, too gross an affront, to pass unnoticed by the newspapers. The\r\nprogress of our movement was indicated in the changed attitude of the\r\nAmerican Press, which had perceived the danger to the public of the\r\nunlawful tactics used by the enemies of Birth Control in preventing open\r\ndiscussion of a vital question.\r\n\r\nNo social idea has inspired its advocates with more bravery, tenacity,\r\nand courage than Birth Control. From the early days of Francis Place\r\nand Richard Carlile, to those of the Drysdales and Edward Trulove, of\r\nBradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant, its advocates have faced imprisonment\r\nand ostracism. In the whole history of the English movement, there has\r\nbeen no more courageous figure than that of the venerable Alice Drysdale\r\nVickery, the undaunted torch-bearer who has bridged the silence of\r\nforty-four years--since the Bradlaugh-Besant trial. She stands head and\r\nshoulders above the professional feminists. Serenely has she withstood\r\njeers and jests. To-day, she continues to point out to the younger\r\ngeneration which is devoted to newer palliatives the fundamental\r\nrelation between Sex and Hunger.\r\n\r\nThe First American Birth Control Conference, held at the same time\r\nas the Washington Conference for the Limitation of Armaments, marks a\r\nturning-point in our approach to social problems. The Conference made\r\nevident the fact that in every field of scientific and social endeavour\r\nthe most penetrating thinkers are now turning to the consideration of\r\nour problem as a fundamental necessity to American civilization. They\r\nare coming to see that a QUALITATIVE factor as opposed to a QUANTITATIVE\r\none is of primary importance in dealing with the great masses of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nCertain fundamental convictions should be made clear here. The programme\r\nfor Birth Control is not a charity. It is not aiming to interfere in\r\nthe private lives of poor people, to tell them how many children\r\nthey should have, nor to sit in judgment upon their fitness to become\r\nparents. It aims, rather, to awaken responsibility, to answer the demand\r\nfor a scientific means by which and through which each human life may\r\nbe self-directed and self-controlled. The exponent of Birth Control, in\r\nshort, is convinced that social regeneration, no less than individual\r\nregeneration, must come from within. Every potential parent, and\r\nespecially every potential mother, must be brought to an acute\r\nrealization of the primary and individual responsibility of bringing\r\nchildren into this world. Not until the parents of this world are given\r\ncontrol over their reproductive faculties will it be possible to improve\r\nthe quality of the generations of the future, or even to maintain\r\ncivilization at its present level. Only when given intelligent mastery\r\nof the procreative powers can the great mass of humanity be aroused to\r\na realization of responsibility of parenthood. We have come to the\r\nconclusion, based on widespread investigation and experience, that\r\neducation for parenthood must be based upon the needs and demands of\r\nthe people themselves. An idealistic code of sexual ethics, imposed from\r\nabove, a set of rules devised by high-minded theorists who fail to take\r\ninto account the living conditions and desires of the masses, can never\r\nbe of the slightest value in effecting change in the customs of the\r\npeople. Systems so imposed in the past have revealed their woeful\r\ninability to prevent the sexual and racial chaos into which the world\r\nhas drifted.\r\n\r\nThe universal demand for practical education in Birth Control is one\r\nof the most hopeful signs that the masses themselves to-day possess\r\nthe divine spark of regeneration. It remains for the courageous and\r\nthe enlightened to answer this demand, to kindle the spark, to direct a\r\nthorough education in sex hygiene based upon this intense interest.\r\n\r\nBirth Control is thus the entering wedge for the educator. In answering\r\nthe needs of these thousands upon thousands of submerged mothers, it\r\nis possible to use their interest as the foundation for education in\r\nprophylaxis, hygiene and infant welfare. The potential mother can\r\nthen be shown that maternity need not be slavery but may be the most\r\neffective avenue to self-development and self-realization. Upon this\r\nbasis only may we improve the quality of the race.\r\n\r\nThe lack of balance between the birth-rate of the \"unfit\" and the \"fit,\"\r\nadmittedly the greatest present menace to the civilization, can never be\r\nrectified by the inauguration of a cradle competition between these\r\ntwo classes. The example of the inferior classes, the fertility of the\r\nfeeble-minded, the mentally defective, the poverty-stricken, should\r\nnot be held up for emulation to the mentally and physically fit, and\r\ntherefore less fertile, parents of the educated and well-to-do classes.\r\nOn the contrary, the most urgent problem to-day is how to limit and\r\ndiscourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective.\r\nPossibly drastic and Spartan methods may be forced upon American\r\nsociety if it continues complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic\r\nbreeding that has resulted from our stupid, cruel sentimentalism.\r\n\r\nTo effect the salvation of the generations of the future--nay, of the\r\ngenerations of to-day--our greatest need, first of all, is the ability\r\nto face the situation without flinching; to cooperate in the formation\r\nof a code of sexual ethics based upon a thorough biological and\r\npsychological understanding of human nature; and then to answer the\r\nquestions and the needs of the people with all the intelligence and\r\nhonesty at our command. If we can summon the bravery to do this, we\r\nshall best be serving the pivotal interests of civilization.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this introduction: my initiation, as I have confessed, was\r\nprimarily an emotional one. My interest in Birth Control was awakened\r\nby experience. Research and investigation have followed. Our effort has\r\nbeen to raise our program from the plane of the emotional to the plane\r\nof the scientific. Any social progress, it is my belief, must purge\r\nitself of sentimentalism and pass through the crucible of science. We\r\nare willing to submit Birth Control to this test. It is part of the\r\npurpose of this book to appeal to the scientist for aid, to arouse that\r\ninterest which will result in widespread research and investigation. I\r\nbelieve that my personal experience with this idea must be that of\r\nthe race at large. We must temper our emotion and enthusiasm with\r\nthe impersonal determination of science. We must unite in the task of\r\ncreating an instrument of steel, strong but supple, if we are to triumph\r\nfinally in the war for human emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: Conscripted Motherhood\r\n\r\n     \"Their poor, old ravaged and stiffened faces, their poor,\r\n     old bodies dried up with ceaseless toil, their patient souls\r\n     made me weep.  They are our conscripts. They are the venerable\r\n     ones whom we should reverence. All the mystery of womanhood\r\n     seems incarnated in their ugly being--the Mothers! the Mothers!\r\n     Ye are all one!\"\r\n\r\n     --From the Letters of William James\r\n\r\nMotherhood, which is not only the oldest but the most important\r\nprofession in the world, has received few of the benefits of\r\ncivilization. It is a curious fact that a civilization devoted to\r\nmother-worship, that publicly professes a worship of mother and child,\r\nshould close its eyes to the appalling waste of human life and human\r\nenergy resulting from those dire consequences of leaving the whole\r\nproblem of child-bearing to chance and blind instinct. It would be\r\nuntrue to say that among the civilized nations of the world to-day, the\r\nprofession of motherhood remains in a barbarous state. The bitter truth\r\nis that motherhood, among the larger part of our population, does not\r\nrise to the level of the barbarous or the primitive. Conditions of life\r\namong the primitive tribes were rude enough and severe enough to\r\nprevent the unhealthy growth of sentimentality, and to discourage the\r\nirresponsible production of defective children. Moreover, there is ample\r\nevidence to indicate that even among the most primitive peoples\r\nthe function of maternity was recognized as of primary and central\r\nimportance to the community.\r\n\r\nIf we define civilization as increased and increasing responsibility\r\nbased on vision and foresight, it becomes painfully evident that the\r\nprofession of motherhood as practised to-day is in no sense civilized.\r\nEducated people derive their ideas of maternity for the most part,\r\neither from the experience of their own set, or from visits to\r\nimpressive hospitals where women of the upper classes receive the\r\nadvantages of modern science and modern nursing. From these charming\r\npictures they derive their complacent views of the beauty of motherhood\r\nand their confidence for the future of the race. The other side of the\r\npicture is revealed only to the trained investigator, to the patient and\r\nimpartial observer who visits not merely one or two \"homes of the poor,\"\r\nbut makes detailed studies of town after town, obtains the history of\r\neach mother, and finally correlates and analyzes this evidence. Upon\r\nsuch a basis are we able to draw conclusions concerning this strange\r\nbusiness of bringing children into the world.\r\n\r\nEvery year I receive thousands of letters from women in all parts of\r\nAmerica, desperate appeals to aid them to extricate themselves from the\r\ntrap of compulsory maternity. Lest I be accused of bias and exaggeration\r\nin drawing my conclusions from these painful human documents, I prefer\r\nto present a number of typical cases recorded in the reports of the\r\nUnited States Government, and in the evidence of trained and impartial\r\ninvestigators of social agencies more generally opposed to the doctrine\r\nof Birth Control than biased in favor of it.\r\n\r\nA perusal of the reports on infant mortality in widely varying\r\nindustrial centers of the United States, published during the past\r\ndecade by the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of\r\nLabor, forces us to a realization of the immediate need of detailed\r\nstatistics concerning the practice and results of uncontrolled breeding.\r\nSome such effort as this has been made by the Galton Laboratory of\r\nNational Eugenics in Great Britain. The Children's Bureau reports only\r\nincidentally present this impressive evidence. They fail to coordinate\r\nit. While there is always the danger of drawing giant conclusions from\r\npigmy premises, here is overwhelming evidence concerning irresponsible\r\nparenthood that is ignored by governmental and social agencies.\r\n\r\nI have chosen a small number of typical cases from these reports. Though\r\ndrawn from widely varying sources, they all emphasize the greatest crime\r\nof modern civilization--that of permitting motherhood to be left to\r\nblind chance, and to be mainly a function of the most abysmally ignorant\r\nand irresponsible classes of the community.\r\n\r\nHere is a fairly typical case from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. A woman\r\nof thirty-eight years had undergone thirteen pregnancies in seventeen\r\nyears. Of eleven live births and two premature stillbirths, only two\r\nchildren were alive at the time of the government agent's visit. The\r\nsecond to eighth, the eleventh and the thirteenth had died of bowel\r\ntrouble, at ages ranging from three weeks to four months. The only cause\r\nof these deaths the mother could give was that \"food did not agree with\r\nthem.\" She confessed quite frankly that she believed in feeding babies,\r\nand gave them everything anybody told her to give them. She began to\r\ngive them at the age of one month, bread, potatoes, egg, crackers, etc.\r\nFor the last baby that died, this mother had bought a goat and gave its\r\nmilk to the baby; the goat got sick, but the mother continued to give\r\nher baby its milk until the goat went dry. Moreover, she directed the\r\nfeeding of her daughter's baby until it died at the age of three months.\r\n\"On account of the many children she had had, the neighbors consider her\r\nan authority on baby care.\"\r\n\r\nLest this case be considered too tragically ridiculous to be accepted\r\nas typical, the reader may verify it with an almost interminable list of\r\nsimilar cases.(1) Parental irresponsibility is significantly illustrated\r\nin another case:\r\n\r\nA mother who had four live births and two stillbirths in twelve years\r\nlost all of her babies during their first year. She was so anxious that\r\nat least one child should live that she consulted a physician concerning\r\nthe care of the last one. \"Upon his advice,\" to quote the government\r\nreport, \"she gave up her twenty boarders immediately after the child's\r\nbirth, and devoted all her time to it. Thinks she did not stop her hard\r\nwork soon enough; says she has always worked too hard, keeping boarders\r\nin this country, and cutting wood and carrying it and water on her back\r\nin the old country. Also says the carrying of water and cases of beer\r\nin this country is a great strain on her.\" But the illuminating point in\r\nthis case is that the father was furious because all the babies died.\r\nTo show his disrespect for the wife who could only give birth to babies\r\nthat died, he wore a red necktie to the funeral of the last. Yet this\r\nwoman, the government agent reports, would follow and profit by any\r\ninstruction that might be given her.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the cases reported from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, do not\r\nrepresent completely \"Americanized\" families. This lack does not prevent\r\nthem, however, by their unceasing fertility from producing the Americans\r\nof to-morrow. Of the more immediate conditions surrounding child-birth,\r\nwe are presented with this evidence, given by one woman concerning the\r\nbirth of her last child:\r\n\r\nOn five o'clock on Wednesday evening she went to her sister's house to\r\nreturn a washboard, after finishing a day's washing. The baby was born\r\nwhile she was there. Her sister was too young to aid her in any way.\r\nShe was not accustomed to a midwife, she confessed. She cut the cord\r\nherself, washed the new-born baby at her sister's house, walked home,\r\ncooked supper for her boarders, and went to bed by eight o'clock. The\r\nnext day she got up and ironed. This tired her out, she said, so she\r\nstayed in bed for two whole days. She milked cows the day after the\r\nbirth of the baby and sold the milk as well. Later in the week, when\r\nshe became tired, she hired someone to do that portion of her work. This\r\nwoman, we are further informed, kept cows, chickens, and lodgers, and\r\nearned additional money by doing laundry and charwork. At times her\r\nhusband deserted her. His earnings amounted to $1.70 a day, while a\r\nfifteen-year-old son earned $1.10 in a coal mine.\r\n\r\nOne searches in vain for some picture of sacred motherhood, as depicted\r\nin popular plays and motion pictures, something more normal and\r\nencouraging. Then one comes to the bitter realization that these, in\r\nvery truth, are the \"normal\" cases, not the exceptions. The exceptions\r\nare apt to indicate, instead, the close relationship of this\r\nirresponsible and chance parenthood to the great social problems of\r\nfeeble-mindedness, crime and syphilis.\r\n\r\nNor is this type of motherhood confined to newly arrived immigrant\r\nmothers, as a government report from Akron, Ohio, sufficiently\r\nindicates. In this city, the government agents discovered that more than\r\nfive hundred mothers were ignorant of the accepted principles of\r\ninfant feeding, or, if familiar with them, did not practise them. \"This\r\nignorance or indifference was not confined to foreign-born mothers.... A\r\nnative mother reported that she gave her two-weeks-old baby ice cream,\r\nand that before his sixth month, he was sitting at the table `eating\r\neverything.\"' This was in a town in which there were comparatively few\r\ncases of extreme poverty.\r\n\r\nThe degradation of motherhood, the damnation of the next generation\r\nbefore it is born, is exposed in all its catastrophic misery, in the\r\nreports of the National Consumers' League. In her report of living\r\nconditions among night-working mothers in thirty-nine textile mills\r\nin Rhode Island, based on exhaustive studies, Mrs. Florence Kelley\r\ndescribes the \"normal\" life of these women:\r\n\r\n\"When the worker, cruelly tired from ten hours' work, comes home in the\r\nearly morning, she usually scrambles together breakfast for the family.\r\nEating little or nothing herself, and that hastily, she tumbles into\r\nbed--not the immaculate bed in an airy bed-room with dark shades, but\r\none still warm from its night occupants, in a stuffy little bed-room,\r\ndarkened imperfectly if at all. After sleeping exhaustedly for an hour\r\nperhaps she bestirs herself to get the children off to school, or care\r\nfor insistent little ones, too young to appreciate that mother is tired\r\nout and must sleep. Perhaps later in the forenoon, she again drops into\r\na fitful sleep, or she may have to wait until after dinner. There is\r\nthe midday meal to get, and, if her husband cannot come home, his\r\ndinner-pail to pack with a hot lunch to be sent or carried to him. If\r\nhe is not at home, the lunch is rather a makeshift. The midday meal is\r\nscarcely over before supper must be thought of. This has to be eaten\r\nhurriedly before the family are ready, for the mother must be in the\r\nmill at work, by 6, 6:30 or 7 P.M.... Many women in their inadequate\r\nEnglish, summed up their daily routine by, 'Oh, me all time tired. TOO\r\nMUCH WORK, TOO MUCH BABY, TOO LITTLE SLEEP!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Only sixteen of the 166 married women were without children; thirty-two\r\nhad three or more; twenty had children one year old or under. There were\r\n160 children under school-age, below six years, and 246 of school age.\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman in ordinary circumstances,\" adds this impartial investigator,\r\n\"with a husband and three children, if she does her own work, feels that\r\nher hands are full. How these mill-workers, many of them frail-looking,\r\nand many with confessedly poor health, can ever do two jobs is a\r\nmystery, when they are seen in their homes dragging about, pale,\r\nhollow-eyed and listless, often needlessly sharp and impatient with the\r\nchildren. These children are not only not mothered, never cherished,\r\nthey are nagged and buffeted. The mothers are not superwomen, and like\r\nall human beings, they have a certain amount of strength and when that\r\nbreaks, their nerves suffer.\"\r\n\r\nWe are presented with a vivid picture of one of these slave-mothers: a\r\nwoman of thirty-eight who looks at least fifty with her worn, furrowed\r\nface. Asked why she had been working at night for the past two years,\r\nshe pointed to a six-months old baby she was carrying, to the five\r\nsmall children swarming about her, and answered laconically, \"Too much\r\nchildren!\" She volunteered the information that there had been two more\r\nwho had died. When asked why they had died, the poor mother shrugged her\r\nshoulders listlessly, and replied, \"Don't know.\" In addition to bearing\r\nand rearing these children, her work would sap the vitality of any\r\nordinary person. \"She got home soon after four in the morning, cooked\r\nbreakfast for the family and ate hastily herself. At 4.30 she was in\r\nbed, staying there until eight. But part of that time was disturbed for\r\nthe children were noisy and the apartment was a tiny, dingy place in\r\na basement. At eight she started the three oldest boys to school, and\r\ncleaned up the debris of breakfast and of supper the night before. At\r\ntwelve she carried a hot lunch to her husband and had dinner ready for\r\nthe three school children. In the afternoon, there were again dishes\r\nand cooking, and caring for three babies aged five, three years, and\r\nsix months. At five, supper was ready for the family. The mother ate by\r\nherself and was off to work at 5:45.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the night-working mothers was a frail looking Frenchwoman of\r\ntwenty-seven years, with a husband and five children ranging from eight\r\nyears to fourteen months. Three other children had died. When visited,\r\nshe was doing a huge washing. She was forced into night work to meet the\r\nexpenses of the family. She estimated that she succeeded in getting\r\nfive hours' sleep during the day. \"I take my baby to bed with me, but he\r\ncries, and my little four-year-old boy cries, too, and comes in to make\r\nme get up, so you can't call that a very good sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem among unmarried women or those without family is not the\r\nsame, this investigator points out. \"They sleep longer by day than they\r\nnormally would by night.\" We are also informed that pregnant women work\r\nat night in the mills, sometimes up to the very hour of delivery. \"It's\r\nqueer,\" exclaimed a woman supervisor of one of the Rhode Island mills,\r\n\"but some women, both on the day and the night shift, will stick to\r\ntheir work right up to the last minute, and will use every means to\r\ndeceive you about their condition. I go around and talk to them, but\r\nmake little impression. We have had several narrow escapes.... A Polish\r\nmother with five children had worked in a mill by day or by night, ever\r\nsince her marriage, stopping only to have her babies. One little girl\r\nhad died several years ago, and the youngest child, says Mrs. Kelley,\r\ndid not look promising. It had none of the charm of babyhood; its\r\nbody and clothing were filthy; and its lower lip and chin covered with\r\nrepulsive black sores.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the Consumers' League, which publishes\r\nthese reports on women in industry, is not advocating Birth Control\r\neducation, but is aiming \"to awaken responsibility for conditions under\r\nwhich goods are produced, and through investigation, education and\r\nlegislation, to mobilize public opinion in behalf of enlightened\r\nstandards for workers and honest products for all.\" Nevertheless, in\r\nMiss Agnes de Lima's report of conditions in Passaic, New Jersey, we\r\nfind the same tale of penalized, prostrate motherhood, bearing the\r\ncrushing burden of economic injustice and cruelty; the same blind but\r\noverpowering instincts of love and hunger driving young women into the\r\nfactories to work, night in and night out, to support their procession\r\nof uncared for and undernourished babies. It is the married women with\r\nyoung children who work on the inferno-like shifts. They are driven to\r\nit by the low wages of their husbands. They choose night work in order\r\nto be with their children in the daytime. They are afraid of the neglect\r\nand ill-treatment the children might receive at the hands of paid\r\ncaretakers. Thus they condemn themselves to eighteen or twenty hours of\r\ndaily toil. Surely no mother with three, four, five or six children can\r\nsecure much rest by day.\r\n\r\n\"Take almost any house\"--we read in the report of conditions in New\r\nJersey--\"knock at almost any door and you will find a weary, tousled\r\nwoman, half-dressed, doing her housework, or trying to snatch an hour or\r\ntwo of sleep after her long night of work in the mill. ... The facts\r\nare there for any one to see; the hopeless and exhausted woman, her\r\ncluttered three or four rooms, the swarm of sickly and neglected\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nThese women claimed that night work was unavoidable, as their husbands\r\nreceived so little pay. This in spite of all our vaunted \"high wages.\"\r\nOnly three women were found who went into the drudgery of night work\r\nwithout being obliged to do so. Two had no children, and their husbands'\r\nearnings were sufficient for their needs. One of these was saving for\r\na trip to Europe, and chose the night shift because she found it less\r\nstrenuous than the day. Only four of the hundred women reported upon\r\nwere unmarried, and ninety-two of the married women had children. Of the\r\nfour childless married women, one had lost two children, and another\r\nwas recovering from a recent miscarriage. There were five widows. The\r\naverage number of children was three in a family. Thirty-nine of the\r\nmothers had four or more. Three of them had six children, and six of\r\nthem had seven children apiece. These women ranged between the ages of\r\ntwenty-five and forty, and more than half the children were less than\r\nseven years of age. Most of them had babies of one, two and three years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of repetition, we quote one of the typical cases reported\r\nby Miss De Lima with features practically identical with the individual\r\ncases reported from Rhode Island. It is of a mother who comes home from\r\nwork at 5:30 every morning, falls on the bed from exhaustion, arises\r\nagain at eight or nine o'clock to see that the older children are sent\r\noff to school. A son of five, like the rest of the children, is on a\r\ndiet of coffee,--milk costs too much. After the children have left for\r\nschool, the overworked mother again tries to sleep, though the small son\r\nbothers her a great deal. Besides, she must clean the house, wash, iron,\r\nmend, sew and prepare the midday meal. She tries to snatch a little\r\nsleep in the afternoon, but explains: \"When you got big family, all time\r\nwork. Night-time in mill drag so long, so long; day-time in home go so\r\nquick.\" By five, this mother must get the family's supper ready, and\r\ndress for the night's work, which begins at seven. The investigator\r\nfurther reports: \"The next day was a holiday, and for a diversion, Mrs.\r\nN. thought she would go up to the cemetery: `I got some children up\r\nthere,' she explained, `and same time I get some air. No, I don't go\r\nnowheres, just to the mill and then home.\"'\r\n\r\nHere again, as in all reports on women in industry, we find the\r\nprevalence of pregnant women working on night-shifts, often to the very\r\nday of their delivery. \"Oh, yes, plenty women, big bellies, work in the\r\nnight time,\" one of the toiling mothers volunteered. \"Shame they go, but\r\nwhat can do?\" The abuse was general. Many mothers confessed that owing\r\nto poverty they themselves worked up to the last week or even day before\r\nthe birth of their children. Births were even reported in one of\r\nthe mills during the night shift. A foreman told of permitting a\r\nnight-working woman to leave at 6.30 one morning, and of the birth of\r\nher baby at 7.30. Several women told of leaving the day-shift because of\r\npregnancy and of securing places on the night-shift where their condition\r\nwas less conspicuous, and the bosses more tolerant. One mother defended\r\nher right to stay at work, says the report, claiming that as long as she\r\ncould do her work, it was nobody's business. In a doorway sat a sickly\r\nand bloodless woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy. Her first baby\r\nhad died of general debility. She had worked at night in the mill until\r\nthe very day of its birth. This time the boss had told her she could\r\nstay if she wished, but reminded her of what had happened last time. So\r\nshe had stopped work, as the baby was expected any day.\r\n\r\nAgain and again we read the same story, which varied only in detail: the\r\nmother in the three black rooms; the sagging porch overflowing with pale\r\nand sickly children; the over-worked mother of seven, still nursing\r\nher youngest, who is two or three months old. Worn and haggard, with a\r\nskeleton-like child pulling at her breast, the women tries to make the\r\ninvestigator understand. The grandmother helps to interpret. \"She never\r\nsleeps,\" explains the old woman, \"how can she with so many children?\"\r\nShe works up to the last moment before her baby comes, and returns to\r\nwork as soon as they are four weeks old.\r\n\r\nAnother apartment in the same house; another of those night-working\r\nmothers, who had just stopped because she is pregnant. The boss had\r\nkindly given her permission to stay on, but she found the reaching on\r\nthe heavy spinning machines too hard. Three children, ranging in age\r\nfrom five to twelve years, are all sickly and forlorn and must be cared\r\nfor. There is a tubercular husband, who is unable to work steadily, and\r\nis able to bring in only $12 a week. Two of the babies had died, one\r\nbecause the mother had returned to work too soon after its birth and had\r\nlost her milk. She had fed him tea and bread, \"so he died.\"\r\n\r\nThe most heartrending feature of it all--in these homes of the mothers\r\nwho work at night--is the expression in the faces of the children;\r\nchildren of chance, dressed in rags, undernourished, underclothed, all\r\npredisposed to the ravages of chronic and epidemic disease.\r\n\r\nThe reports on infant mortality published under the direction of the\r\nChildren's Bureau substantiate for the United States of America the\r\nfindings of the Galton Laboratory for Great Britain, showing that an\r\nabnormally high rate of fertility is usually associated with poverty,\r\nfilth, disease, feeblemindedness and a high infant mortality rate. It\r\nis a commonplace truism that a high birth-rate is accompanied by a high\r\ninfant-mortality rate. No longer is it necessary to dissociate cause and\r\neffect, to try to determine whether the high birth rate is the cause of\r\nthe high infant mortality rate. It is sufficient to know that they are\r\norganically correlated along with other anti-social factors detrimental\r\nto individual, national and racial welfare. The figures presented by\r\nHibbs (2) likewise reveal a much higher infant mortality rate for the\r\nlater born children of large families.\r\n\r\nThe statistics which show that the greatest number of children are born\r\nto parents whose earnings are the lowest,(3) that the direst poverty is\r\nassociated with uncontrolled fecundity emphasize the character of the\r\nparenthood we are depending upon to create the race of the future.\r\n\r\nA distinguished American opponent of Birth Control some years ago spoke\r\nof the \"racial\" value of this high infant mortality rate among the\r\n\"unfit.\" He forgot, however, that the survival-rate of the children\r\nborn of these overworked and fatigued mothers may nevertheless be large\r\nenough, aided and abetted by philanthropies and charities, to form the\r\ngreater part of the population of to-morrow. As Dr. Karl Pearson has\r\nstated: \"Degenerate stocks under present social conditions are not\r\nshort-lived; they live to have more than the normal size of family.\"\r\n\r\nReports of charitable organizations; the famous \"one hundred neediest\r\ncases\" presented every year by the New York Times to arouse the\r\nsentimental generosity of its readers; statistics of public and private\r\nhospitals, charities and corrections; analyses of pauperism in town\r\nand country--all tell the same tale of uncontrolled and irresponsible\r\nfecundity. The facts, the figures, the appalling truth are there for all\r\nto read. It is only in the remedy proposed, the effective solution, that\r\ninvestigators and students of the problem disagree.\r\n\r\nConfronted with the \"startling and disgraceful\" conditions of affairs\r\nindicated by the fact that a quarter of a million babies die every year\r\nin the United States before they are one year old, and that no less\r\nthan 23,000 women die in childbirth, a large number of experts and\r\nenthusiasts have placed their hopes in maternity-benefit measures.\r\n\r\nSuch measures sharply illustrate the superficial and fragmentary manner\r\nin which the whole problem of motherhood is studied to-day. It seeks a\r\nLAISSER FAIRE policy of parenthood or marriage, with an indiscriminating\r\npaternalism concerning maternity. It is as though the Government were\r\nto say: \"Increase and multiply; we shall assume the responsibility of\r\nkeeping your babies alive.\" Even granting that the administration of\r\nthese measures might be made effective and effectual, which is more\r\nthan doubtful, we see that they are based upon a complete ignorance\r\nor disregard of the most important fact in the situation--that of\r\nindiscriminate and irresponsible fecundity. They tacitly assume that\r\nall parenthood is desirable, that all children should be born, and\r\nthat infant mortality can be controlled by external aid. In the great\r\nworld-problem of creating the men and women of to-morrow, it is not\r\nmerely a question of sustaining the lives of all children, irrespective\r\nof their hereditary and physical qualities, to the point where they,\r\nin turn, may reproduce their kind. Advocates of Birth Control offer and\r\naccept no such superficial solution. This philosophy is based upon\r\na clearer vision and a more profound comprehension of human life. Of\r\nimmediate relief for the crushed and enslaved motherhood of the world\r\nthrough State aid, no better criticism has been made than that of\r\nHavelock Ellis:\r\n\r\n\"To the theoretical philanthropist, eager to reform the world on paper,\r\nnothing seems simpler than to cure the present evils of child-rearing\r\nby setting up State nurseries which are at once to relieve mothers of\r\neverything connected with the men of the future beyond the pleasure--if\r\nsuch it happens to be--of conceiving them, and the trouble of bearing\r\nthem, and at the same time to rear them up independently of the home, in\r\na wholesome, economical and scientific manner. Nothing seems simpler,\r\nbut from the fundamental psychological point of view nothing is\r\nfalser.... A State which admits that the individuals composing it are\r\nincompetent to perform their most sacred and intimate functions, and\r\ntakes it upon itself to perform them itself instead, attempts a task\r\nthat would be undesirable, even if it were possible of achievement.(4)\"\r\nIt may be replied that maternity benefit measures aim merely to aid\r\nmothers more adequately to fulfil their biological and social functions.\r\nBut from the point of view of Birth Control, that will never be possible\r\nuntil the crushing exigencies of overcrowding are removed--overcrowding\r\nof pregnancies as well as of homes. As long as the mother remains the\r\npassive victim of blind instinct, instead of the conscious, responsible\r\ninstrument of the life-force, controlling and directing its expression,\r\nthere can be no solution to the intricate and complex problems that\r\nconfront the whole world to-day. This is, of course, impossible as long\r\nas women are driven into the factories, on night as well as day shifts,\r\nas long as children and girls and young women are driven into industries\r\nto labor that is physically deteriorating as a preparation for the\r\nsupreme function of maternity.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Birth Control insists that motherhood, no less\r\nthan any other human function, must undergo scientific study, must be\r\nvoluntarily directed and controlled with intelligence and foresight. As\r\nlong as we countenance what H. G. Wells has well termed \"the monstrous\r\nabsurdity of women discharging their supreme social function, bearing\r\nand rearing children, in their spare time, as it were, while they `earn\r\ntheir living' by contributing some half-mechanical element to some\r\ntrivial industrial product\" any attempt to furnish \"maternal education\"\r\nis bound to fall on stony ground. Children brought into the world as the\r\nchance consequences of the blind play of uncontrolled instinct, become\r\nlikewise the helpless victims of their environment. It is because\r\nchildren are cheaply conceived that the infant mortality rate is high.\r\nBut the greatest evil, perhaps the greatest crime, of our so-called\r\ncivilization of to-day, is not to be gauged by the infant-mortality\r\nrate. In truth, unfortunate babies who depart during their first twelve\r\nmonths are more fortunate in many respects than those who survive to\r\nundergo punishment for their parents' cruel ignorance and complacent\r\nfecundity. If motherhood is wasted under the present regime of \"glorious\r\nfertility,\" childhood is not merely wasted, but actually destroyed.\r\nLet us look at this matter from the point of view of the children who\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\n     (1)  U.S. Department of Labor: Children's Bureau.

A few years\r\nago, the scandal of children under fourteen working in cotton mills was\r\nexposed. There was muckraking and agitation. A wave of moral indignation\r\nswept over America. There arose a loud cry for immediate action. Then,\r\nhaving more or less successfully settled this particular matter, the\r\nAmerican people heaved a sigh of relief, settled back, and complacently\r\ncongratulated itself that the problem of child labor had been settled\r\nonce and for all.\r\n\r\nConditions are worse to-day than before. Not only is there child labor\r\nin practically every State in the Union, but we are now forced to\r\nrealize the evils that result from child labor, of child laborers\r\nnow grown into manhood and womanhood. But we wish here to point out a\r\nneglected aspect of this problem. Child labor shows us how cheaply we\r\nvalue childhood. And moreover, it shows us that cheap childhood is the\r\ninevitable result of chance parenthood. Child labor is organically bound\r\nup with the problem of uncontrolled breeding and the large family.\r\n\r\nThe selective draft of 1917--which was designed to choose for military\r\nservice only those fulfiling definite requirements of physical\r\nand mental fitness--showed some of the results of child labor. It\r\nestablished the fact that the majority of American children never got\r\nbeyond the sixth grade, because they were forced to leave school at that\r\ntime. Our over-advertised compulsory education does not compel--and does\r\nnot educate. The selective-draft, it is our duty to emphasize this fact,\r\nrevealed that 38 per cent. of the young men (more than a million) were\r\nrejected because of physical ill-health and defects. And 25 per cent.\r\nwere illiterate.\r\n\r\nThese young men were the children of yesterday. Authorities tell us that\r\n75 per cent. of the school-children are defective. This means that\r\nno less than fifteen million schoolchildren, out of 22,000,000 in the\r\nUnited States, are physically or mentally below par.\r\n\r\nThis is the soil in which all sorts of serious evils strike root. It is\r\na truism that children are the chief asset of a nation. Yet while the\r\nUnited States government allotted 92.8 per cent. of its appropriations\r\nfor 1920 toward war expenses, three per cent. to public works, 3.2 per\r\ncent. to \"primary governmental functions,\" no more than one per cent.\r\nis appropriated to education, research and development. Of this one\r\nper cent., only a small proportion is devoted to public health. The\r\nconservation of childhood is a minor consideration. While three cents\r\nis spent for the more or less doubtful protection of women and\r\nchildren, fifty cents is given to the Bureau of Animal Industry, for\r\nthe protection of domestic animals. In 1919, the State of Kansas\r\nappropriated $25,000 to protect the health of pigs, and $4,000 to\r\nprotect the health of children. In four years our Federal Government\r\nappropriated--roughly speaking--$81,000,000 for the improvement\r\nof rivers; $13,000,000 for forest conservation; $8,000,000 for the\r\nexperimental plant industry; $7,000,000 for the experimental animal\r\nindustry; $4,000,000 to combat the foot and mouth disease; and less than\r\nhalf a million for the protection of child life.\r\n\r\nCompetent authorities tell us that no less than 75 per cent. of American\r\nchildren leave school between the ages of fourteen and sixteen to go\r\nto work. This number is increasing. According to the recently published\r\nreport on \"The Administration of the First Child Labor Law,\" in five\r\nstates in which it was necessary for the Children's Bureau to handle\r\ndirectly the working certificates of children, one-fifth of the 25,000\r\nchildren who applied for certificates left school when they were in the\r\nfourth grade; nearly a tenth of them had never attended school at all or\r\nhad not gone beyond the first grade; and only one-twenty-fifth had gone\r\nas far as the eighth grade. But their educational equipment was even\r\nmore limited than the grade they attended would indicate. Of the\r\nchildren applying to go to work 1,803 had not advanced further than the\r\nfirst grade even when they had gone to school at all; 3,379 could not\r\neven sign their own names legibly, and nearly 2,000 of them could not\r\nwrite at all. The report brings automatically into view the vicious\r\ncircle of child-labor, illiteracy, bodily and mental defect, poverty and\r\ndelinquency. And like all reports on child labor, the large family and\r\nreckless breeding looms large in the background as one of the chief\r\nfactors in the problem.\r\n\r\nDespite all our boasting of the American public school, of the equal\r\nopportunity afforded to every child in America, we have the shortest\r\nschool-term, and the shortest school-day of any of the civilized\r\ncountries. In the United States of America, there are 106 illiterates to\r\nevery thousand people. In England there are 58 per thousand, Sweden and\r\nNorway have one per thousand.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the most illiterate country in the world--that is,\r\nof the so-called civilized countries. Of the 5,000,000 illiterates\r\nin the United States, 58 per cent. are white and 28 per cent. native\r\nwhites. Illiteracy not only is the index of inequality of opportunity.\r\nIt speaks as well a lack of consideration for the children. It means\r\neither that children have been forced out of school to go to work, or\r\nthat they are mentally and physically defective.(1)\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to ask why a society, which has failed so lamentably to\r\nprotect the already existing child life upon which its very perpetuation\r\ndepends, takes upon itself the reckless encouragement of indiscriminate\r\nprocreation. The United States Government has recently inaugurated a\r\npolicy of restricting immigration from foreign countries. Until it is\r\nable to protect childhood from criminal exploitation, until it has made\r\npossible a reasonable hope of life, liberty and growth for American\r\nchildren, it should likewise recognize the wisdom of voluntary\r\nrestriction in the production of children.\r\n\r\nReports on child labor published by the National Child Labor Committee\r\nonly incidentally reveal the correlation of this evil with that of large\r\nfamilies. Yet this is evident throughout. The investigators are more\r\nbent upon regarding child labor as a cause of illiteracy.\r\n\r\nBut it is no less a consequence of irresponsibility in breeding. A\r\nsinister aspect of this is revealed by Theresa Wolfson's study of\r\nchild-labor in the beet-fields of Michigan.(2) As one weeder put it:\r\n\"Poor man make no money, make plenty children--plenty children good for\r\nsugar-beet business.\" Further illuminating details are given by Miss\r\nWolfson:\r\n\r\n\"Why did they come to the beet-fields? Most frequently families with\r\nlarge numbers of children said that they felt that the city was no place\r\nto raise children--things too expensive and children ran wild--in the\r\ncountry all the children could work.\" Living conditions are abominable\r\nand unspeakably wretched. An old woodshed, a long-abandoned barn, and\r\noccasionally a tottering, ramshackle farmer's house are the common\r\ntypes. \"One family of eleven, the youngest child two years, the oldest\r\nsixteen years, lived in an old country store which had but one window;\r\nthe wind and rain came through the holes in the walls, the ceiling was\r\nvery low and the smoke from the stove filled the room. Here the family\r\nate, slept, cooked and washed.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Tuscola County a family of six was found living in a one-room shack\r\nwith no windows. Light and ventilation was secured through the open\r\ndoors. Little Charles, eight years of age, was left at home to take\r\ncare of Dan, Annie and Pete, whose ages were five years, four years, and\r\nthree months, respectively. In addition, he cooked the noonday meal and\r\nbrought it to his parents in the field. The filth and choking odors of\r\nthe shack made it almost unbearable, yet the baby was sleeping in a heap\r\nof rags piled up in a corner.\"\r\n\r\nSocial philosophers of a certain school advocate the return to the\r\nland--it is only in the overcrowded city, they claim, that the evils\r\nresulting from the large family are possible. There is, according to\r\nthis philosophy, no overcrowding, no over-population in the country,\r\nwhere in the open air and sunlight every child has an opportunity for\r\nhealth and growth. This idyllic conception of American country life\r\ndoes not correspond with the picture presented by this investigator, who\r\npoints out:\r\n\r\n\"To promote the physical and mental development of the child, we forbid\r\nhis employment in factories, shops and stores. On the other hand, we are\r\nprone to believe that the right kind of farm-work is healthful and the\r\nbest thing for children. But for a child to crawl along the ground,\r\nweeding beets in the hot sun for fourteen hours a day--the average\r\nworkday--is far from being the best thing. The law of compensation is\r\nbound to work in some way, and the immediate result of this agricultural\r\nwork is interference with school attendance.\"\r\n\r\nHow closely related this form of child-slavery is to the over-large\r\nfamily, is definitely illustrated: \"In the one hundred and thirty-three\r\nfamilies visited, there were six hundred children. A conversation held\r\nwith a 'Rooshian-German' woman is indicative of the size of most of the\r\nfamilies:\"\r\n\r\n\"How many children have you?\" inquired the investigator.\r\n\r\n\"Eight--Julius, und Rose, und Martha, dey is mine; Gottlieb und Philip,\r\nund Frieda, dey is my husband's;--und Otto und Charlie--dey are ours.\"\r\n\r\nFamilies with ten and twelve children were frequently found, while those\r\nof six and eight children are the general rule. The advantage of a large\r\nfamily in the beet fields is that it does the most work. In the one\r\nhundred thirty-three families interviewed, there were one hundred\r\neighty-six children under the age of six years, ranging from eight weeks\r\nup; thirty-six children between the ages of six and eight, approximately\r\ntwenty-five of whom had never been to school, and eleven over sixteen\r\nyears of age who had never been to school. One ten-year-old boy had\r\nnever been to school because he was a mental defective; one child of\r\nnine was practically blinded by cataracts. This child was found groping\r\nhis way down the beet-rows pulling out weeds and feeling for the\r\nbeet-plants--in the glare of the sun he had lost all sense of light and\r\ndark. Of the three hundred and forty children who were not going or had\r\nnever gone to school, only four had reached the point of graduation, and\r\nonly one had gone to high school. These large families migrated to the\r\nbeet-fields in early spring. Seventy-two per cent. of them are retarded.\r\nWhen we realize that feeble-mindedness is arrested development and\r\nretardation, we see that these \"beet children\" are artificially retarded\r\nin their growth, and that the tendency is to reduce their intelligence\r\nto the level of the congenital imbecile.\r\n\r\nNor must it be concluded that these large \"beet\" families are always the\r\n\"ignorant foreigner\" so despised by our respectable press. The following\r\ncase throws some light on this matter, reported in the same pamphlet:\r\n\"An American family, considered a prize by the agent because of the fact\r\nthat there were nine children, turned out to be a `flunk.' They could\r\nnot work in the beet-fields, they ran up a bill at the country-store,\r\nand one day the father and the eldest son, a boy of nineteen, were seen\r\nrunning through the railroad station to catch an out-going train. The\r\ngrocer thought they were `jumping' their bill. He telephoned ahead\r\nto the sheriff of the next town. They were taken off the train by the\r\nsheriff and given the option of going back to the farm or staying in\r\njail. They preferred to stay in jail, and remained there for two weeks.\r\nMeanwhile, the mother and her eight children, ranging in ages form\r\nseventeen years to nine months, had to manage the best way they could.\r\nAt the end of two weeks, father and son were set free.... During all of\r\nthis period the farmers of the community sent in provisions to keep\r\nthe wife and children from starving.\" Does this case not sum up in a\r\nnutshell the typical American intelligence confronted with the\r\nproblem of the too-large family--industrial slavery tempered with\r\nsentimentality!\r\n\r\nLet us turn to a young, possibly a more progressive state. Consider the\r\ncase of \"California, the Golden\" as it is named by Emma Duke, in her\r\nstudy of child-labor in the Imperial Valley, \"as fertile as the Valley\r\nof the Nile.\"(3) Here, cotton is king, and rich ranchers, absentee\r\nlandlords and others exploit it. Less than ten years ago ranchers\r\nwould bring in hordes of laboring families, but refuse to assume any\r\nresponsibility in housing them, merely permitting them to sleep on\r\nthe grounds of the ranch. Conditions have been somewhat improved, but,\r\nsometimes, we read, \"a one roomed straw house with an area of fifteen\r\nby twenty feet will serve as a home for an entire family, which not\r\nonly cooks but sleeps in the same room.\" Here, as in Michigan among the\r\nbeets, children are \"thick as bees.\" All kinds of children pick,\r\nMiss Duke reports, \"even those as young as three years! Five-year-old\r\nchildren pick steadily all day.... Many white American children are\r\namong them--pure American stock, who have gradually moved from the\r\nCarolinas, Tennessee, and other southern states to Arkansas, Texas,\r\nOklahoma, Arizona, and on into the Imperial Valley.\" Some of these\r\nchildren, it seems, wanted to attend school, but their fathers did not\r\nwant to work; so the children were forced to become bread-winners. One\r\nman whose children were working with him in the fields said, \"Please,\r\nlady, don't send them to school; let them pick a while longer. I ain't\r\ngot my new auto paid for yet.\" The native white American mother of\r\nchildren working in the fields proudly remarked: \"No; they ain't\r\nnever been to school, nor me nor their poppy, nor their granddads and\r\ngrandmoms. We've always been pickers!\"--and she spat her tobacco over\r\nthe field in expert fashion.\r\n\r\n\"In the Valley one hears from townspeople,\" writes the investigator,\r\n\"that pickers make ten dollars a day, working the whole family. With\r\nthat qualification, the statement is ambiguous. One Mexican in the\r\nImperial Valley was the father of thirty-three children--`about thirteen\r\nor fourteen living,' he said. If they all worked at cotton-picking, they\r\nwould doubtless altogether make more than ten dollars a day.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the child laborers revealed the economic advantage--to the\r\nparents--in numerous progeny: \"Us kids most always drag from forty to\r\nfifty pounds of cotton before we take it to be weighed. Three of us\r\npick. I'm twelve years old and my bag is twelve feet long. I can drag\r\nnearly a hundred pounds. My sister is ten years old, and her bag is\r\neight feet long. My little brother is seven and his bag is five feet\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nEvidence abounds in the publications of the National Child Labor\r\nCommittee of this type of fecund parenthood.(4) It is not merely a\r\nquestion of the large family versus the small family. Even comparatively\r\nsmall families among migratory workers of this sort have been large\r\nfamilies. The high infant mortality rate has carried off the weaker\r\nchildren. Those who survive are merely those who have been strong enough\r\nto survive the most unfavorable living conditions. No; it is a situation\r\nnot unique, nor even unusual in human history, of greed and stupidity\r\nand cupidity encouraging the procreative instinct toward the manufacture\r\nof slaves. We hear these days of the selfishness and the degradation\r\nof healthy and well-educated women who refuse motherhood; but we hear\r\nlittle of the more sinister selfishness of men and women who bring\r\nbabies into the world to become child-slaves of the kind described in\r\nthese reports of child labor.\r\n\r\nThe history of child labor in the English factories in the nineteenth\r\ncentury throws a suggestive light on this situation. These child-workers\r\nwere really called into being by the industrial situation. The\r\npopulation grew, as Dean Inge has described it, like crops in a newly\r\nirrigated desert. During the nineteenth century, the numbers were nearly\r\nquadrupled. \"Let those who think that the population of a country can\r\nbe increased at will, consider whether it is likely that any physical,\r\nmoral, or psychological change came over the nation co-incidentally with\r\nthe inventions of the spinning jenny and the steam engine. It is too\r\nobvious for dispute that it was the possession of capital wanting\r\nemployment, and of natural advantages for using it, that called those\r\nmultitudes of human beings into existence, to eat the food which they\r\npaid for by their labor.\"(5)\r\n\r\nBut when child labor in the factories became such a scandal and such a\r\ndisgrace that child-labor was finally forbidden by laws that possessed\r\nthe advantage over our own that they were enforced, the proletariat\r\nceased to supply children. Almost by magic the birth rate among the\r\nworkers declined. Since children were no longer of economic value to\r\nthe factories, they were evidently a drug in the home. This movement, it\r\nshould not be forgotten however, was coincident with the agitation and\r\neducation in Birth Control stimulated by the Besant-Bradlaugh trial.\r\n\r\nLarge families among migratory agricultural laborers in our own country\r\nare likewise brought into existence in response to an industrial demand.\r\nThe enforcement of the child labor laws and the extension of their\r\nrestrictions are therefore an urgent necessity, not so much, as some of\r\nour child-labor authorities believe, to enable these children to go to\r\nschool, as to prevent the recruiting of our next generation from the\r\nleast intelligent and most unskilled classes in the community. As long\r\nas we officially encourage and countenance the production of large\r\nfamilies, the evils of child labor will confront us. On the other hand,\r\nthe prohibition of child labor may help, as in the case of English\r\nfactories, in the decline of the birth rate.\r\n\r\nUNCONTROLLED BREEDING AND CHILD LABOR GO HAND IN HAND. And to-day\r\nwhen we are confronted with the evils of the latter, in the form of\r\nwidespread illiteracy and defect, we should seek causes more deeply\r\nrooted than the enslavement of children. The cost to society is\r\nincalculable, as the National Child Labor Committee points out. \"It\r\nis not only through the lowered power, the stunting and the moral\r\ndegeneration of its individual members, but in actual expense, through\r\nthe necessary provision for the human junk, created by premature\r\nemployment, in poor-houses, hospitals, police and courts, jails and by\r\ncharitable organizations.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day we are paying for the folly of the over-production--and its\r\nconsequences in permanent injury to plastic childhood--of yesterday.\r\nTo-morrow, we shall be forced to pay for our ruthless disregard of our\r\nsurplus children of to-day. The child-laborer of one or two decades\r\nago has become the shifting laborer of to-day, stunted, underfed,\r\nilliterate, unskilled, unorganized and unorganizable. \"He is the last\r\nperson to be hired and the first to be fired.\" Boys and girls under\r\nfourteen years of age are no longer permitted to work in factories,\r\nmills, canneries and establishments whose products are to be shipped out\r\nof the particular state, and children under sixteen can no longer work\r\nin mines and quarries. But this affects only one quarter of our army of\r\nchild labor--work in local industries, stores, and farms, homework\r\nin dark and unsanitary tenements is still permitted. Children work in\r\n\"homes\" on artificial flowers, finishing shoddy garments, sewing their\r\nvery life's blood and that of the race into tawdry clothes and gewgaws\r\nthat are the most unanswerable comments upon our vaunted \"civilization.\"\r\nAnd to-day, we must not forget, the child-laborer of yesterday is\r\nbecoming the father or the mother of the child-laborer of to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Any nation that works its women is damned,\" once wrote Woods\r\nHutchinson. The nation that works its children, one is tempted to add,\r\nis committing suicide. Loud-mouthed defenders of American democracy pay\r\nno attention to the strange fact that, although \"the average education\r\namong all American adults is only the sixth grade,\" every one of these\r\nadults has an equal power at the polls. The American nation, with all\r\nits worship of efficiency and thrift, complacently forgets that \"every\r\nchild defective in body, education or character is a charge upon the\r\ncommunity,\" as Herbert Hoover declared in an address before the American\r\nChild Hygiene Association (October, 1920): \"The nation as a whole,\" he\r\nadded, \"has the obligation of such measures toward its children... as\r\nwill yield to them an equal opportunity at their start in life. If we\r\ncould grapple with the whole child situation for one generation, our\r\npublic health, our economic efficiency, the moral character, sanity and\r\nstability of our people would advance three generations in one.\"\r\n\r\nThe great irrefutable fact that is ignored or neglected is that the\r\nAmerican nation officially places a low value upon the lives of\r\nits children. The brutal truth is that CHILDREN ARE CHEAP. When\r\nover-production in this field is curtailed by voluntary restriction,\r\nwhen the birth rate among the working classes takes a sharp decline, the\r\nvalue of children will rise. Then only will the infant mortality rate\r\ndecline, and child labor vanish.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of child labor emphasize its evils by pointing out that\r\nthese children are kept out of school, and that they miss the advantages\r\nof American public school education. They express the current confidence\r\nin compulsory education and the magical benefits to be derived from\r\nthe public school. But we need to qualify our faith in education, and\r\nparticularly our faith in the American public school. Educators are just\r\nbeginning to wake up to the dangers inherent in the attempt to teach the\r\nbrightest child and the mentally defective child at the same time. They\r\nare beginning to test the possibilities of a \"vertical\" classification\r\nas well as a \"horizontal\" one. That is, each class must be divided into\r\nwhat are termed Gifted, Bright, Average, Dull, Normal, and Defective. In\r\nthe past the helter-skelter crowding and over-crowding together of all\r\nclasses of children of approximately the same age, produced only a dull\r\nleveling to mediocrity.(6)\r\n\r\nAn investigation of forty schools in New York City, typical of hundreds\r\nof others, reveals deplorable conditions of overcrowding and lack of\r\nsanitation.(7) The worst conditions are to be found in locations the\r\nmost densely populated. Thus of Public School No. 51, located almost in\r\nthe center of the notorious \"Hell's Kitchen\" section, we read: \"The play\r\nspace which is provided is a mockery of the worst kind. The basement\r\nplay-room is dark, damp, poorly lighted, poorly ventilated, foul\r\nsmelling, unclean, and wholly unfit for children for purposes of play.\r\nThe drainpipes from the roof have decayed to such a degree that in some\r\ninstances as little as a quarter of the pipe remains. On rainy days,\r\nwater enters the classrooms, hallways,  corridors, and is thrown\r\nagainst windows because the pipes have rotted away. The narrow stairways\r\nand halls are similar to those of jails and dungeons of a century ago.\r\nThe classrooms are poorly lighted, inadequately equipped, and in some\r\ncases so small that the desks of pupils and teachers occupy almost all\r\nof the floor-space.\"\r\n\r\nAnother school, located a short distance from Fifth Avenue, the\r\n\"wealthiest street in the world,\" is described as an \"old shell of a\r\nstructure, erected decades ago as a modern school building. Nearly two\r\nthousand children are crowded into class-rooms having a total seating\r\ncapacity of scarcely one thousand. Narrow doorways, intricate hallways\r\nand antiquated stairways, dark and precipitous, keep ever alive the\r\ndanger of disaster from fire or panic. Only the eternal vigilance\r\nof exceptional supervision has served to lessen the fear of such a\r\ncatastrophe. Artificial light is necessary, even on the brightest days,\r\nin many of the class-rooms. In most of the classrooms, it is always\r\nnecessary when the sky is slightly overcast.\" There is no ventilating\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn the crowded East Side section conditions are reported to be no\r\nbetter. The Public Education Association's report on Public School No.\r\n130 points out that the site at the corner of Hester and Baxter Streets\r\nwas purchased by the city years ago as a school site, but that there\r\nhas been so much \"tweedledeeing and tweedleduming\" that the new building\r\nwhich is to replace the old, has not even yet been planned! Meanwhile,\r\nyear after year, thousands of children are compelled to study daily in\r\ndark and dingy class-rooms. \"Artificial light is continually necessary,\"\r\ndeclares the report. \"The ventilation is extremely poor. The fire hazard\r\nis naturally great. There are no rest-rooms whatever for the teachers.\"\r\nOther schools in the neighborhood reveal conditions even worse. In\r\ntwo of them, for example; \"In accordance with the requirements of\r\nthe syllabus in hygiene in the schools, the vision of the children is\r\nregularly tested. In a recent test of this character, it was found in\r\nPublic School 108, the rate of defective vision in the various grades\r\nranged from 50 to 64 per cent.! In Public School 106, the rate ranged\r\nfrom 43 to 94 per cent.!\"\r\n\r\nThe conditions, we are assured, are no exceptions to the rule of\r\npublic schools in New York, where the fatal effects of overcrowding\r\nin education may be observed in their most sinister but significant\r\naspects.\r\n\r\nThe forgotten fact in this case is that efforts for universal and\r\ncompulsory education cannot keep pace with the overproduction of\r\nchildren. Even at the best, leaving out of consideration the public\r\nschool system as the inevitable prey and plundering-ground of the cheap\r\npolitician and job-hunter, present methods of wholesale and syndicated\r\n\"education\" are not suited to compete with the unceasing, unthinking,\r\nuntiring procreative powers of our swarming, spawning populations.\r\n\r\nInto such schools as described in the recent reports of the Public\r\nEducation Association, no intelligent parent would dare send his child.\r\nThey are not merely fire-traps and culture-grounds of infection, but of\r\nmoral and intellectual contamination as well. More and more are public\r\nschools in America becoming institutions for subjecting children to\r\na narrow and reactionary orthodoxy, aiming to crush out all signs\r\nof individuality, and to turn out boys and girls compressed into a\r\nstandardized pattern, with ready-made ideas on politics, religion,\r\nmorality, and economics. True education cannot grow out of such\r\ncompulsory herding of children in filthy fire-traps.\r\n\r\nCharacter, ability, and reasoning power are not to be developed in\r\nthis fashion. Indeed, it is to be doubted whether even a completely\r\nsuccessful educational system could offset the evils of indiscriminate\r\nbreeding and compensate for the misfortune of being a superfluous child.\r\nIn recognizing the great need of education, we have failed to recognize\r\nthe greater need of inborn health and character. \"If it were necessary\r\nto choose between the task of getting children educated and getting them\r\nwell born and healthy,\" writes Havelock Ellis, \"it would be better to\r\nabandon education. There have been many great peoples who never dreamed\r\nof national systems of education; there have been no great peoples\r\nwithout the art of producing healthy and vigorous children. The matter\r\nbecomes of peculiar importance in great industrial states, like\r\nEngland, the United States and Germany, because in such states, a tacit\r\nconspiracy tends to grow up to subordinate national ends to individual\r\nends, and practically to work for the deterioration of the race.\"(8)\r\n\r\nMuch less can education solve the great problem of child labor. Rather,\r\nunder the conditions prevailing in modern society, child labor and the\r\nfailure of the public schools to educate are both indices of a more\r\ndeeply rooted evil. Both bespeak THE UNDERVALUATION OF THE CHILD. This\r\nundervaluation, this cheapening of child life, is to speak crudely but\r\nfrankly the direct result of overproduction. \"Restriction of output\" is\r\nan immediate necessity if we wish to regain control of the real values,\r\nso that unimpeded, unhindered, and without danger of inner corruption,\r\nhumanity may protect its own health and powers.\r\n\r\n     (1)  I am indebted to the National Child Labor Committee for\r\n     these statistics, as well as for many of the facts that\r\n     follow.\r\n\r\n     (2)  \"People Who Go to Beets\" Pamphlet No. 299, National\r\n     Child Labor Committee.\r\n\r\n     (3)  California the Golden, by Emma Duke.

That is, as the best authorities are\r\nagreed, to prevent the birth of those who would transmit imbecility to\r\ntheir descendants. Feeble-mindedness as investigations and statistics\r\nfrom every country indicate, is invariably associated with an abnormally\r\nhigh rate of fertility. Modern conditions of civilization, as we are\r\ncontinually being reminded, furnish the most favorable breeding-ground\r\nfor the mental defective, the moron, the imbecile. \"We protect the\r\nmembers of a weak strain,\" says Davenport, \"up to the period of\r\nreproduction, and then let them free upon the community, and encourage\r\nthem to leave a large progeny of `feeble-minded': which in turn,\r\nprotected from mortality and carefully nurtured up to the reproductive\r\nperiod, are again set free to reproduce, and so the stupid work goes on\r\nof preserving and increasing our socially unfit strains.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Birth Control points out that as long as civilized\r\ncommunities encourage unrestrained fecundity in the \"normal\" members\r\nof the population--always of course under the cloak of decency and\r\nmorality--and penalize every attempt to introduce the principle of\r\ndiscrimination and responsibility in parenthood, they will be faced with\r\nthe ever-increasing problem of feeble-mindedness, that fertile parent\r\nof degeneracy, crime, and pauperism. Small as the percentage of the\r\nimbecile and half-witted may seem in comparison with the normal members\r\nof the community, it should always be remembered that feeble-mindedness\r\nis not an unrelated expression of modern civilization. Its roots strike\r\ndeep into the social fabric. Modern studies indicate that insanity,\r\nepilepsy, criminality, prostitution, pauperism, and mental defect, are\r\nall organically bound up together and that the least intelligent and the\r\nthoroughly degenerate classes in every community are the most prolific.\r\nFeeble-mindedness in one generation becomes pauperism or insanity in the\r\nnext. There is every indication that feeble-mindedness in its protean\r\nforms is on the increase, that it has leaped the barriers, and that\r\nthere is truly, as some of the scientific eugenists have pointed out, a\r\nfeeble-minded peril to future generations--unless the feeble-minded are\r\nprevented from reproducing their kind. To meet this emergency is the\r\nimmediate and peremptory duty of every State and of all communities.\r\n\r\nThe curious situation has come about that while our statesmen are\r\nbusy upon their propaganda of \"repopulation,\" and are encouraging the\r\nproduction of large families, they are ignoring the exigent problem of\r\nthe elimination of the feeble-minded. In this, however, the politicians\r\nare at one with the traditions of a civilization which, with its\r\ncharities and philanthropies, has propped up the defective and\r\ndegenerate and relieved them of the burdens borne by the healthy\r\nsections of the community, thus enabling them more easily and more\r\nnumerously to propagate their kind. \"With the very highest motives,\"\r\ndeclares Dr. Walter E. Fernald, \"modern philanthropic efforts often tend\r\nto foster and increase the growth of defect in the community.... The only\r\nfeeble-minded persons who now receive any official consideration are\r\nthose who have already become dependent or delinquent, many of whom have\r\nalready become parents. We lock the barn-door after the horse is stolen.\r\nWe now have state commissions for controlling the gipsy-moth and\r\nthe boll weevil, the foot-and-mouth disease, and for protecting the\r\nshell-fish and wild game, but we have no commission which even attempts\r\nto modify or to control the vast moral and economic forces represented\r\nby the feeble-minded persons at large in the community.\"\r\n\r\nHow the feeble-minded and their always numerous progeny run the gamut\r\nof police, alms-houses, courts, penal institutions, \"charities and\r\ncorrections,\" tramp shelters, lying-in hospitals, and relief afforded by\r\nprivately endowed religious and social agencies, is shown in any\r\nnumber of reports and studies of family histories. We find cases of\r\nfeeble-mindedness and mental defect in the reports on infant mortality\r\nreferred to in a previous chapter, as well as in other reports published\r\nby the United States government. Here is a typical case showing the\r\nastonishing ability to \"increase and multiply,\" organically bound up\r\nwith delinquency and defect of various types:\r\n\r\n\"The parents of a feeble-minded girl, twenty years of age, who was\r\ncommitted to the Kansas State Industrial Farm on a vagrancy charge,\r\nlived in a thickly populated Negro district which was reported by\r\nthe police to be the headquarters for the criminal element of the\r\nsurrounding State.... The mother married at fourteen, and her first\r\nchild was born at fifteen. In rapid succession she gave birth to sixteen\r\nlive-born children and had one miscarriage. The first child, a girl,\r\nmarried but separated from her husband.... The fourth, fifth and sixth,\r\nall girls, died in infancy or early childhood. The seventh, a girl,\r\nremarried after the death of her husband, from whom she had been\r\nseparated. The eighth, a boy who early in life began to exhibit criminal\r\ntendencies, was in prison for highway robbery and burglary. The ninth, a\r\ngirl, normal mentally, was in quarantine at the Kansas State Industrial\r\nFarm at the time this study was made; she had lived with a man as\r\nhis common-law wife, and had also been arrested several times for\r\nsoliciting. The tenth, a boy, was involved in several delinquencies when\r\nyoung and was sent to the detention-house but did not remain there\r\nlong. The eleventh, a boy... at the age of seventeen was sentenced to the\r\npenitentiary for twenty years on a charge of first-degree robbery; after\r\nserving a portion of his time, he was paroled, and later was shot and\r\nkilled in a fight. The twelfth, a boy, was at fifteen years of age\r\nimplicated in a murder and sent to the industrial school, but escaped\r\nfrom there on a bicycle which he had stolen; at eighteen, he was shot\r\nand killed by a woman. The thirteenth child, feeble-minded, is the girl\r\nof the study. The fourteenth, a boy was considered by police to be the\r\nbest member of the family; his mother reported him to be much slower\r\nmentally than his sister just mentioned; he had been arrested several\r\ntimes. Once, he was held in the detention-home and once sent to the\r\nState Industrial school; at other times, he was placed on probation.\r\nThe fifteenth, a girl sixteen years old, has for a long time had a bad\r\nreputation. Subsequent to the commitment of her sister to the Kansas\r\nState Industrial Farm, she was arrested on a charge of vagrancy, found\r\nto be syphilitic, and quarantined in a state other than Kansas. At the\r\ntime of her arrest, she stated that prostitution was her occupation.\r\nThe last child was a boy of thirteen years whose history was not\r\nsecured....\"(1)\r\n\r\nThe notorious fecundity of feeble-minded women is emphasized in studies\r\nand investigations of the problem, coming from all countries. \"The\r\nfeeble-minded woman is twice as prolific as the normal one.\" Sir James\r\nCrichton-Browne speaks of the great numbers of feeble-minded girls,\r\nwholly unfit to become mothers, who return to the work-house year after\r\nyear to bear children, \"many of whom happily die, but some of whom\r\nsurvive to recruit our idiot establishments and to repeat their mothers'\r\nperformances.\" Tredgold points out that the number of children born to\r\nthe feeble-minded is abnormally high. Feeble-minded women \"constitute\r\na permanent menace to the race and one which becomes serious at a time\r\nwhen the decline of the birth-rate is... unmistakable.\" Dr. Tredgold\r\npoints out that \"the average number of children born in a family is\r\nfour,\" whereas in these degenerate families, we find an average of 7.3 to\r\neach. Out of this total only a little more than ONE-THIRD--456 out of\r\na total of 1,269 children--can be considered profitable members of the\r\ncommunity, and that, be it remembered, at the parents' valuation.\r\n\r\nAnother significant point is the number of mentally defective children\r\nwho survive. \"Out of the total number of 526 mentally affected persons\r\nin the 150 families, there are 245 in the present generation--an\r\nunusually large survival.\"(2)\r\n\r\nSpeaking for Bradford, England, Dr. Helen U. Campbell touches another\r\nsignificant and interesting point usually neglected by the advocates of\r\nmothers' pensions, milk-stations, and maternity-education programs.\r\n\r\n\"We are also confronted with the problem of the actually mentally\r\ndeficient, of the more or less feeble-minded, and the deranged,\r\nepileptic... or otherwise mentally abnormal mother,\" writes this\r\nauthority. \"The `bad mothering' of these cases is quite unimprovable\r\nat an infant welfare center, and a very definite if not relatively very\r\nlarge percentage of our infants are suffering severely as a result of\r\ndependence upon such `mothering.\"'(3)\r\n\r\nThus we are brought face to face with another problem of infant\r\nmortality. Are we to check the infant mortality rate among the\r\nfeeble-minded and aid the unfortunate offspring to grow up, a menace to\r\nthe civilized community even when not actually certifiable as mentally\r\ndefective or not obviously imbecile?\r\n\r\nOther figures and studies indicate the close relationship between\r\nfeeble-mindedness and the spread of venereal scourges. We are informed\r\nthat in Michigan, 75 per cent. of the prostitute class is infected with\r\nsome form of venereal disease, and that 75 per cent. of the infected\r\nare mentally defective,--morons, imbeciles, or \"border-line\" cases\r\nmost dangerous to the community at large. At least 25 per cent. of the\r\ninmates of our prisons, according to Dr. Fernald, are mentally defective\r\nand belong either to the feeble-minded or to the defective-delinquent\r\nclass. Nearly 50 per cent. of the girls sent to reformatories are\r\nmental defectives. To-day, society treats feeble-minded or \"defective\r\ndelinquent\" men or women as \"criminals,\" sentences them to prison or\r\nreformatory for a \"term,\" and then releases them at the expiration\r\nof their sentences. They are usually at liberty just long enough to\r\nreproduce their kind, and then they return again and again to prison.\r\nThe truth of this statement is evident from the extremely large\r\nproportion in institutions of neglected and dependent children, who are\r\nthe feeble-minded offspring of such feeble-minded parents.\r\n\r\nConfronted with these shocking truths about the menace of\r\nfeeble-mindedness to the race, a menace acute because of the unceasing\r\nand unrestrained fertility of such defectives, we are apt to become the\r\nvictims of a \"wild panic for instant action.\" There is no occasion for\r\nhysterical, ill-considered action, specialists tell us. They direct our\r\nattention to another phase of the problem, that of the so-called \"good\r\nfeeble-minded.\" We are informed that imbecility, in itself, is not\r\nsynonymous with badness. If it is fostered in a \"suitable environment,\"\r\nit may express itself in terms of good citizenship and useful\r\noccupation. It may thus be transmuted into a docile, tractable, and\r\npeaceable element of the community. The moron and the feeble-minded,\r\nthus protected, so we are assured, may even marry some brighter member\r\nof the community, and thus lessen the chances of procreating another\r\ngeneration of imbeciles. We read further that some of our doctors\r\nbelieve that \"in our social scale, there is a place for the good\r\nfeeble-minded.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a reckless and thoughtless differentiation between the \"bad\"\r\nand the \"good\" feeble-minded, we find new evidence of the conventional\r\nmiddle-class bias that also finds expression among some of the\r\neugenists. We do not object to feeble-mindedness simply because it\r\nleads to immorality and criminality; nor can we approve of it when it\r\nexpresses itself in docility, submissiveness and obedience. We object\r\nbecause both are burdens and dangers to the intelligence of the\r\ncommunity. As a matter of fact, there is sufficient evidence to lead us\r\nto believe that the so-called \"borderline cases\" are a greater menace\r\nthan the out-and-out \"defective delinquents\" who can be supervised,\r\ncontrolled and prevented from procreating their kind. The advent of the\r\nBinet-Simon and similar psychological tests indicates that the mental\r\ndefective who is glib and plausible, bright looking and attractive, but\r\nwith a mental vision of seven, eight or nine years, may not merely lower\r\nthe whole level of intelligence in a school or in a society, but may\r\nbe encouraged by church and state to increase and multiply until he\r\ndominates and gives the prevailing \"color\"--culturally speaking--to an\r\nentire community.\r\n\r\nThe presence in the public schools of the mentally defective children\r\nof men and women who should never have been parents is a problem that\r\nis becoming more and more difficult, and is one of the chief reasons for\r\nlower educational standards. As one of the greatest living authorities\r\non the subject, Dr. A. Tredgold, has pointed out,(4) this has created\r\na destructive conflict of purpose. \"In the case of children with a low\r\nintellectual capacity, much of the education at present provided is\r\nfor all practical purposes a complete waste of time, money and\r\npatience.... On the other hand, for children of high intellectual\r\ncapacity, our present system does not go far enough. I believe that\r\nmuch innate potentiality remains undeveloped, even amongst the working\r\nclasses, owing to the absence of opportunity for higher education, to\r\nthe disadvantage of the nation. In consequence of these fundamental\r\ndifferences, the catchword `equality of opportunity' is meaningless\r\nand mere claptrap in the absence of any equality to respond to such\r\nopportunity. What is wanted is not equality of opportunity, but\r\neducation adapted to individual potentiality; and if the time and money\r\nnow spent in the fruitless attempt to make silk-purses out of sows'\r\nears, were devoted to the higher education of children of good natural\r\ncapacity, it would contribute enormously to national efficiency.\"\r\n\r\nIn a much more complex manner than has been recognized even by students\r\nof this problem, the destiny and the progress of civilization and of\r\nhuman expression has been hindered and held back by this burden of the\r\nimbecile and the moron. While we may admire the patience and the deep\r\nhuman sympathy with which the great specialists in feeble-mindedness\r\nhave expressed the hope of drying up the sources of this evil or of\r\nrendering it harmless, we should not permit sympathy or sentimentality\r\nto blind us to the fact that health and vitality and human growth\r\nlikewise need cultivation. \"A LAISSER FAIRE policy,\" writes one\r\ninvestigator, \"simply allows the social sore to spread. And a quasi\r\nLAISSER FAIRE policy wherein we allow the defective to commit crime\r\nand then interfere and imprison him, wherein we grant the defective the\r\npersonal liberty to do as he pleases, until he pleases to descend to a\r\nplane of living below the animal level, and try to care for a few of his\r\ndescendants who are so helpless that they can no longer exercise that\r\npersonal liberty to do as they please,\"--such a policy increases and\r\nmultiplies the dangers of the over-fertile feeble-minded.(5)\r\n\r\nThe Mental Survey of the State of Oregon recently published by the\r\nUnited States Health Service, sets an excellent example and should be\r\nfollowed by every state in the Union and every civilized country as\r\nwell. It is greatly to the credit of the Western State that it is one of\r\nthe first officially to recognize the primary importance of this problem\r\nand to realize that facts, no matter how fatal to self-satisfaction,\r\nmust be faced. This survey, authorized by the state legislature, and\r\ncarried out by the University of Oregon, in collaboration with Dr. C.\r\nL. Carlisle of the Public Health service, aided by a large number of\r\nvolunteers, shows that only a small percentage of mental defectives and\r\nmorons are in the care of institutions. The rest are widely scattered\r\nand their condition unknown or neglected. They are docile and\r\nsubmissive, they do not attract attention to themselves as do the\r\ncriminal delinquents and the insane. Nevertheless, it is estimated that\r\nthey number no less than 75,000 men, women, and children, out of a total\r\npopulation of 783,000, or about ten per cent. Oregon, it is thought, is\r\nno exception to other states. Yet under our present conditions, these\r\npeople are actually encouraged to increase and multiply and replenish\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nConcerning the importance of the Oregon survey, we may quote Surgeon\r\nGeneral H. C. Cumming: \"the prevention and correction of mental\r\ndefectives is one of the great public health problems of to-day. It\r\nenters into many phases of our work and its influence continually crops\r\nup unexpectedly. For instance, work of the Public Health Service in\r\nconnection with juvenile courts shows that a marked proportion of\r\njuvenile delinquency is traceable to some degree of mental deficiency\r\nin the offender. For years Public Health officials have concerned\r\nthemselves only with the disorders of physical health; but now they are\r\nrealizing the significance of mental health also. The work in Oregon\r\nconstitutes the first state-wide survey which even begins to disclose\r\nthe enormous drain on a state, caused by mental defects. One of the\r\nobjects of the work was to obtain for the people of Oregon an idea\r\nof the problem that confronted them and the heavy annual loss, both\r\neconomic and industrial, that it entailed. Another was to enable the\r\nlegislators to devise a program that would stop much of the loss,\r\nrestore to health and bring to lives of industrial usefulness, many of\r\nthose now down and out, and above all, to save hundreds of children from\r\ngrowing up to lives of misery.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to see how many of our State Legislatures have\r\nthe intelligence and the courage to follow in the footsteps of Oregon in\r\nthis respect. Nothing could more effectually stimulate discussion, and\r\nawaken intelligence as to the extravagance and cost to the community of\r\nour present codes of traditional morality. But we should make sure\r\nin all such surveys, that mental defect is not concealed even in such\r\ndignified bodies as state legislatures and among those leaders who are\r\nurging men and women to reckless and irresponsible procreation.\r\n\r\nI have touched upon these various aspects of the complex problem of the\r\nfeeble-minded, and the menace of the moron to human society, not merely\r\nfor the purpose of reiterating that it is one of the greatest and most\r\ndifficult social problems of modern times, demanding an immediate, stern\r\nand definite policy, but because it illustrates the actual harvest of\r\nreliance upon traditional morality, upon the biblical injunction to\r\nincrease and multiply, a policy still taught by politician, priest\r\nand militarist. Motherhood has been held universally sacred; yet, as\r\nBouchacourt pointed out, \"to-day, the dregs of the human species, the\r\nblind, the deaf-mute, the degenerate, the nervous, the vicious, the\r\nidiotic, the imbecile, the cretins and the epileptics--are better\r\nprotected than pregnant women.\" The syphilitic, the irresponsible, the\r\nfeeble-minded are encouraged to breed unhindered, while all the powerful\r\nforces of tradition, of custom, or prejudice, have bolstered up the\r\ndesperate effort to block the inevitable influence of true civilization\r\nin spreading the principles of independence, self-reliance,\r\ndiscrimination and foresight upon which the great practice of\r\nintelligent parenthood is based.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are confronted by the results of this official policy. There\r\nis no escaping it; there is no explaining it away. Surely it is an\r\namazing and discouraging phenomenon that the very governments that have\r\nseen fit to interfere in practically every phase of the normal citizen's\r\nlife, dare not attempt to restrain, either by force or persuasion, the\r\nmoron and the imbecile from producing his large family of feeble-minded\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nIn my own experience, I recall vividly the case of a feeble-minded girl\r\nwho every year, for a long period, received the expert attention of a\r\ngreat specialist in one of the best-known maternity hospitals of New\r\nYork City. The great obstetrician, for the benefit of interns and\r\nmedical students, performed each year a Caesarian operation upon this\r\nunfortunate creature to bring into the world her defective, and, in\r\none case at least, her syphilitic, infant. \"Nelly\" was then sent to a\r\nspecial room and placed under the care of a day nurse and a night nurse,\r\nwith extra and special nourishment provided. Each year she returned to\r\nthe hospital. Such cases are not exceptions; any experienced doctor or\r\nnurse can recount similar stories. In the interest of medical science\r\nthis practice may be justified. I am not criticising it from that\r\npoint of view. I realize as well as the most conservative moralist that\r\nhumanity requires that healthy members of the race should make certain\r\nsacrifices to preserve from death those unfortunates who are born with\r\nhereditary taints. But there is a point at which philanthropy may become\r\npositively dysgenic, when charity is converted into injustice to the\r\nself-supporting citizen, into positive injury to the future of the race.\r\nSuch a point, it seems obvious, is reached when the incurably defective\r\nare permitted to procreate and thus increase their numbers.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the dependent, delinquent and defective elements in\r\nmodern society, we must repeat, cannot be minimized because of their\r\nalleged small numerical proportion to the rest of the population. The\r\nproportion seems small only because we accustom ourselves to the habit\r\nof looking upon feeble-mindedness as a separate and distinct calamity to\r\nthe race, as a chance phenomenon unrelated to the sexual and biological\r\ncustoms not only condoned but even encouraged by our so-called\r\ncivilization. The actual dangers can only be fully realized when we have\r\nacquired definite information concerning the financial and cultural cost\r\nof these classes to the community, when we become fully cognizant of the\r\nburden of the imbecile upon the whole human race; when we see the funds\r\nthat should be available for human development, for scientific, artistic\r\nand philosophic research, being diverted annually, by hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars, to the care and segregation of men, women, and\r\nchildren who never should have been born. The advocate of Birth Control\r\nrealizes as well as all intelligent thinkers the dangers of interfering\r\nwith personal liberty. Our whole philosophy is, in fact, based upon\r\nthe fundamental assumption that man is a self-conscious, self-governing\r\ncreature, that he should not be treated as a domestic animal; that he\r\nmust be left free, at least within certain wide limits, to follow his\r\nown wishes in the matter of mating and in the procreation of children.\r\nNor do we believe that the community could or should send to the\r\nlethal chamber the defective progeny resulting from irresponsible and\r\nunintelligent breeding.\r\n\r\nBut modern society, which has respected the personal liberty of the\r\nindividual only in regard to the unrestricted and irresponsible bringing\r\ninto the world of filth and poverty an overcrowding procession of\r\ninfants foredoomed to death or hereditable disease, is now confronted\r\nwith the problem of protecting itself and its future generations\r\nagainst the inevitable consequences of this long-practised policy of\r\nLAISSER-FAIRE.\r\n\r\nThe emergency problem of segregation and sterilization must be faced\r\nimmediately. Every feeble-minded girl or woman of the hereditary\r\ntype, especially of the moron class, should be segregated during the\r\nreproductive period. Otherwise, she is almost certain to bear imbecile\r\nchildren, who in turn are just as certain to breed other defectives. The\r\nmale defectives are no less dangerous. Segregation carried out for one\r\nor two generations would give us only partial control of the problem.\r\nMoreover, when we realize that each feeble-minded person is a potential\r\nsource of an endless progeny of defect, we prefer the policy of\r\nimmediate sterilization, of making sure that parenthood is absolutely\r\nprohibited to the feeble-minded.\r\n\r\nThis, I say, is an emergency measure. But how are we to prevent the\r\nrepetition in the future of a new harvest of imbecility, the recurrence\r\nof new generations of morons and defectives, as the logical and\r\ninevitable consequence of the universal application of the traditional\r\nand widely approved command to increase and multiply?\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, we are offered three distinct and more or less\r\nmutually exclusive policies by which civilization may hope to protect\r\nitself and the generations of the future from the allied dangers of\r\nimbecility, defect and delinquency. No one can understand the necessity\r\nfor Birth Control education without a complete comprehension of the\r\ndangers, the inadequacies, or the limitations of the present attempts at\r\ncontrol, or the proposed programs for social reconstruction and racial\r\nregeneration. It is, therefore, necessary to interpret and criticize\r\nthe three programs offered to meet our emergency. These may be briefly\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Philanthropy and Charity: This is the present and traditional method\r\nof meeting the problems of human defect and dependence, of poverty and\r\ndelinquency. It is emotional, altruistic, at best ameliorative, aiming\r\nto meet the individual situation as it arises and presents itself. Its\r\neffect in practise is seldom, if ever, truly preventive. Concerned\r\nwith symptoms, with the allaying of acute and catastrophic miseries, it\r\ncannot, if it would, strike at the radical causes of social misery. At\r\nits worst, it is sentimental and paternalistic.\r\n\r\n(2) Marxian Socialism: This may be considered typical of many widely\r\nvarying schemes of more or less revolutionary social reconstruction,\r\nemphasizing the primary importance of environment, education, equal\r\nopportunity, and health, in the elimination of the conditions (i. e.\r\ncapitalistic control of industry) which have resulted in biological\r\nchaos and human waste. I shall attempt to show that the Marxian doctrine\r\nis both too limited, too superficial and too fragmentary in its\r\nbasic analysis of human nature and in its program of revolutionary\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n(3) Eugenics: Eugenics seems to me to be valuable in its critical and\r\ndiagnostic aspects, in emphasizing the danger of irresponsible and\r\nuncontrolled fertility of the \"unfit\" and the feeble-minded establishing\r\na progressive unbalance in human society and lowering the birth-rate\r\namong the \"fit.\" But in its so-called \"constructive\" aspect, in seeking\r\nto reestablish the dominance of healthy strain over the unhealthy, by\r\nurging an increased birth-rate among the fit, the Eugenists really offer\r\nnothing more farsighted than a \"cradle competition\" between the fit\r\nand the unfit. They suggest in very truth, that all intelligent and\r\nrespectable parents should take as their example in this grave matter of\r\nchild-bearing the most irresponsible elements in the community.\r\n\r\n     (1)  United States Public Health Service:  Psychiatric\r\n     Studies of Delinquents.

It is a deliberate storing\r\n     up of miseries for future generations.  There is no greater\r\n     curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing\r\n     population of imbeciles.\"\r\n\r\n     Herbert Spencer\r\n\r\nThe last century has witnessed the rise and development of philanthropy\r\nand organized charity. Coincident with the all-conquering power of\r\nmachinery and capitalistic control, with the unprecedented growth\r\nof great cities and industrial centers, and the creation of great\r\nproletarian populations, modern civilization has been confronted, to a\r\ndegree hitherto unknown in human history, with the complex problem of\r\nsustaining human life in surroundings and under conditions flagrantly\r\ndysgenic.\r\n\r\nThe program, as I believe all competent authorities in contemporary\r\nphilanthropy and organized charity would agree, has been altered in aim\r\nand purpose. It was first the outgrowth of humanitarian and altruistic\r\nidealism, perhaps not devoid of a strain of sentimentalism, of an\r\nidealism that was aroused by a desperate picture of human misery\r\nintensified by the industrial revolution. It has developed in later\r\nyears into a program not so much aiming to succor the unfortunate\r\nvictims of circumstances, as to effect what we may term social\r\nsanitation. Primarily, it is a program of self-protection. Contemporary\r\nphilanthropy, I believe, recognizes that extreme poverty and overcrowded\r\nslums are veritable breeding-grounds of epidemics, disease, delinquency\r\nand dependency. Its aim, therefore, is to prevent the individual family\r\nfrom sinking to that abject condition in which it will become a much\r\nheavier burden upon society.\r\n\r\nThere is no need here to criticize the obvious limitations of organized\r\ncharities in meeting the desperate problem of destitution. We are all\r\nfamiliar with these criticisms: the common indictment of \"inefficiency\"\r\nso often brought against public and privately endowed agencies. The\r\ncharges include the high cost of administration; the pauperization\r\nof deserving poor, and the encouragement and fostering of the\r\n\"undeserving\"; the progressive destruction of self-respect and\r\nself-reliance by the paternalistic interference of social agencies; the\r\nimpossibility of keeping pace with the ever-increasing multiplication of\r\nfactors and influences responsible for the perpetuation of human misery;\r\nthe misdirection and misappropriation of endowments; the absence of\r\ninterorganization and coordination of the various agencies of church,\r\nstate, and privately endowed institutions; the \"crimes of charity\"\r\nthat are occasionally exposed in newspaper scandals. These and similar\r\nstrictures we may ignore as irrelevant to our present purpose, as\r\ninevitable but not incurable faults that have been and are being\r\neliminated in the slow but certain growth of a beneficent power in\r\nmodern civilization. In reply to such criticisms, the protagonist of\r\nmodern philanthropy might justly point to the honest and sincere workers\r\nand disinterested scientists it has mobilized, to the self-sacrificing\r\nand hard-working executives who have awakened public attention to the\r\nevils of poverty and the menace to the race engendered by misery and\r\nfilth.\r\n\r\nEven if we accept organized charity at its own valuation, and grant that\r\nit does the best it can, it is exposed to a more profound criticism.\r\nIt reveals a fundamental and irremediable defect. Its very success, its\r\nvery efficiency, its very necessity to the social order, are themselves\r\nthe most unanswerable indictment. Organized charity itself is the\r\nsymptom of a malignant social disease.\r\n\r\nThose vast, complex, interrelated organizations aiming to control and to\r\ndiminish the spread of misery and destitution and all the menacing evils\r\nthat spring out of this sinisterly fertile soil, are the surest\r\nsign that our civilization has bred, is breeding and is perpetuating\r\nconstantly increasing numbers of defectives, delinquents and\r\ndependents. My criticism, therefore, is not directed at the \"failure\" of\r\nphilanthropy, but rather at its success.\r\n\r\nThese dangers inherent in the very idea of humanitarianism and altruism,\r\ndangers which have to-day produced their full harvest of human waste, of\r\ninequality and inefficiency, were fully recognized in the last century\r\nat the moment when such ideas were first put into practice. Readers of\r\nHuxley's attack on the Salvation Army will recall his penetrating\r\nand stimulating condemnation of the debauch of sentimentalism which\r\nexpressed itself in so uncontrolled a fashion in the Victorian era. One\r\nof the most penetrating of American thinkers, Henry James, Sr., sixty or\r\nseventy years ago wrote: \"I have been so long accustomed to see the most\r\narrant deviltry transact itself in the name of benevolence, that the\r\nmoment I hear a profession of good will from almost any quarter, I\r\ninstinctively look around for a constable or place my hand within reach\r\nof a bell-rope. My ideal of human intercourse would be a state of things\r\nin which no man will ever stand in need of any other man's help, but\r\nwill derive all his satisfaction from the great social tides which\r\nown no individual names. I am sure no man can be put in a position of\r\ndependence upon another, without the other's very soon becoming--if he\r\naccepts the duties of the relation--utterly degraded out of his just\r\nhuman proportions. No man can play the Deity to his fellow man with\r\nimpunity--I mean, spiritual impunity, of course. For see: if I am at all\r\nsatisfied with that relation, if it contents me to be in a position of\r\ngenerosity towards others, I must be remarkably indifferent at bottom to\r\nthe gross social inequality which permits that position, and, instead\r\nof resenting the enforced humiliation of my fellow man to myself in the\r\ninterests of humanity, I acquiesce in it for the sake of the profit it\r\nyields to my own self-complacency. I do hope the reign of benevolence\r\nis over; until that event occurs, I am sure the reign of God will be\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day, we may measure the evil effects of \"benevolence\" of this type,\r\nnot merely upon those who have indulged in it, but upon the community at\r\nlarge. These effects have been reduced to statistics and we cannot, if\r\nwe would, escape their significance. Look, for instance (since they are\r\nclose at hand, and fairly representative of conditions elsewhere) at\r\nthe total annual expenditures of public and private \"charities and\r\ncorrections\" for the State of New York. For the year ending June 30,\r\n1919, the expenditures of public institutions and agencies amounted to\r\n$33, 936,205.88. The expenditures of privately supported and endowed\r\ninstitutions for the same year, amount to $58,100,530.98. This makes\r\na total, for public and private charities and corrections of\r\n$92,036,736.86. A conservative estimate of the increase for the\r\nyear (1920-1921) brings this figure approximately to one-hundred and\r\ntwenty-five millions. These figures take on an eloquent significance if\r\nwe compare them to the comparatively small amounts spent upon education,\r\nconservation of health and other constructive efforts. Thus, while the\r\nCity of New York spent $7.35 per capita on public education in the year\r\n1918, it spent on public charities no less than $2.66. Add to this last\r\nfigure an even larger amount dispensed by private agencies, and we may\r\nderive some definite sense of the heavy burden of dependency, pauperism\r\nand delinquency upon the normal and healthy sections of the community.\r\n\r\nStatistics now available also inform us that more than a million dollars\r\nare spent annually to support the public and private institutions in\r\nthe state of New York for the segregation of the feeble-minded and\r\nthe epileptic. A million and a half is spent for the up-keep of state\r\nprisons, those homes of the \"defective delinquent.\" Insanity, which, we\r\nshould remember, is to a great extent hereditary, annually drains from\r\nthe state treasury no less than $11,985,695.55, and from private sources\r\nand endowments another twenty millions. When we learn further that the\r\ntotal number of inmates in public and private institutions in the State\r\nof New York--in alms-houses, reformatories, schools for the blind,\r\ndeaf and mute, in insane asylums, in homes for the feeble-minded and\r\nepileptic--amounts practically to less than sixty-five thousand, an\r\ninsignificant number compared to the total population, our eyes should\r\nbe opened to the terrific cost to the community of this dead weight of\r\nhuman waste.\r\n\r\nThe United States Public Health Survey of the State of Oregon, recently\r\npublished, shows that even a young community, rich in natural resources,\r\nand unusually progressive in legislative measures, is no less subject to\r\nthis burden. Out of a total population of 783,000 it is estimated that\r\nmore than 75,000 men, women and children are dependents, feeble-minded,\r\nor delinquents. Thus about 10 per cent. of the population is a constant\r\ndrain on the finances, health, and future of that community. These\r\nfigures represent a more definite and precise survey than the rough one\r\nindicated by the statistics of charities and correction for the State\r\nof New York. The figures yielded by this Oregon survey are also\r\nconsiderably lower than the average shown by the draft examination, a\r\nfact which indicates that they are not higher than might be obtained\r\nfrom other States.\r\n\r\nOrganized charity is thus confronted with the problem of\r\nfeeble-mindedness and mental defect. But just as the State has so far\r\nneglected the problem of mental defect until this takes the form\r\nof criminal delinquency, so the tendency of our philanthropic and\r\ncharitable agencies has been to pay no attention to the problem until\r\nit has expressed itself in terms of pauperism and delinquency. Such\r\n\"benevolence\" is not merely ineffectual; it is positively injurious to\r\nthe community and the future of the race.\r\n\r\nBut there is a special type of philanthropy or benevolence, now widely\r\nadvertised and advocated, both as a federal program and as worthy of\r\nprivate endowment, which strikes me as being more insidiously injurious\r\nthan any other. This concerns itself directly with the function of\r\nmaternity, and aims to supply GRATIS medical and nursing facilities\r\nto slum mothers. Such women are to be visited by nurses and to receive\r\ninstruction in the \"hygiene of pregnancy\"; to be guided in making\r\narrangements for confinements; to be invited to come to the doctor's\r\nclinics for examination and supervision. They are, we are informed, to\r\n\"receive adequate care during pregnancy, at confinement, and for one\r\nmonth afterward.\" Thus are mothers and babies to be saved. \"Childbearing\r\nis to be made safe.\" The work of the maternity centers in the various\r\nAmerican cities in which they have already been established and in which\r\nthey are supported by private contributions and endowment, it is hardly\r\nnecessary to point out, is carried on among the poor and more docile\r\nsections of the city, among mothers least able, through poverty and\r\nignorance, to afford the care and attention necessary for successful\r\nmaternity. Now, as the findings of Tredgold and Karl Pearson and the\r\nBritish Eugenists so conclusively show, and as the infant mortality\r\nreports so thoroughly substantiate, a high rate of fecundity is always\r\nassociated with the direst poverty, irresponsibility, mental defect,\r\nfeeble-mindedness, and other transmissible taints. The effect of\r\nmaternity endowments and maternity centers supported by private\r\nphilanthropy would have, perhaps already have had, exactly the most\r\ndysgenic tendency. The new government program would facilitate the\r\nfunction of maternity among the very classes in which the absolute\r\nnecessity is to discourage it.\r\n\r\nSuch \"benevolence\" is not merely superficial and near-sighted. It\r\nconceals a stupid cruelty, because it is not courageous enough to face\r\nunpleasant facts. Aside from the question of the unfitness of many women\r\nto become mothers, aside from the very definite deterioration in the\r\nhuman stock that such programs would inevitably hasten, we may question\r\nits value even to the normal though unfortunate mother. For it is never\r\nthe intention of such philanthropy to give the poor over-burdened and\r\noften undernourished mother of the slum the opportunity to make the\r\nchoice herself, to decide whether she wishes time after to time to bring\r\nchildren into the world. It merely says \"Increase and multiply: We are\r\nprepared to help you do this.\" Whereas the great majority of mothers\r\nrealize the grave responsibility they face in keeping alive and rearing\r\nthe children they have already brought into the world, the maternity\r\ncenter would teach them how to have more. The poor woman is taught how\r\nto have her seventh child, when what she wants to know is how to avoid\r\nbringing into the world her eighth.\r\n\r\nSuch philanthropy, as Dean Inge has so unanswerably pointed out, is kind\r\nonly to be cruel, and unwittingly promotes precisely the results most\r\ndeprecated. It encourages the healthier and more normal sections of the\r\nworld to shoulder the burden of unthinking and indiscriminate fecundity\r\nof others; which brings with it, as I think the reader must agree,\r\na dead weight of human waste. Instead of decreasing and aiming to\r\neliminate the stocks that are most detrimental to the future of the race\r\nand the world, it tends to render them to a menacing degree dominant.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the program is an indication of a suddenly awakened\r\npublic recognition of the shocking conditions surrounding pregnancy,\r\nmaternity, and infant welfare prevailing at the very heart of our\r\nboasted civilization. So terrible, so unbelievable, are these conditions\r\nof child-bearing, degraded far below the level of primitive and\r\nbarbarian tribes, nay, even below the plane of brutes, that many\r\nhigh-minded people, confronted with such revolting and disgraceful\r\nfacts, lost that calmness of vision and impartiality of judgment so\r\nnecessary in any serious consideration of this vital problem. Their\r\n\"hearts\" are touched; they become hysterical; they demand immediate\r\naction; and enthusiastically and generously they support the first\r\nsuperficial program that is advanced. Immediate action may sometimes be\r\nworse than no action at all. The \"warm heart\" needs the balance of\r\nthe cool head. Much harm has been done in the world by those\r\ntoo-good-hearted folk who have always demanded that \"something be done\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\nThey do not stop to consider that the very first thing to be done is to\r\nsubject the whole situation to the deepest and most rigorous thinking.\r\nAs the late Walter Bagehot wrote in a significant but too often\r\nforgotten passage:\r\n\r\n\"The most melancholy of human reflections, perhaps, is that on the whole\r\nit is a question whether the benevolence of mankind does more good or\r\nharm. Great good, no doubt, philanthropy does, but then it also does\r\ngreat evil. It augments so much vice, it multiplies so much suffering,\r\nit brings to life such great populations to suffer and to be vicious,\r\nthat it is open to argument whether it be or be not an evil to the\r\nworld, and this is entirely because excellent people fancy they can do\r\nmuch by rapid action, and that they will most benefit the world when\r\nthey most relieve their own feelings; that as soon as an evil is seen,\r\n`something' ought to be done to stay and prevent it. One may incline to\r\nhope that the balance of good over evil is in favor of benevolence; one\r\ncan hardly bear to think that it is not so; but anyhow it is certain\r\nthat there is a most heavy debt of evil, and that this burden might\r\nalmost all have been spared us if philanthropists as well as others\r\nhad not inherited from their barbarous forefathers a wild passion for\r\ninstant action.\"\r\n\r\nIt is customary, I believe, to defend philanthropy and charity upon\r\nthe basis of the sanctity of human life. Yet recent events in the world\r\nreveal a curious contradiction in this respect. Human life is held\r\nsacred, as a general Christian principle, until war is declared, when\r\nhumanity indulges in a universal debauch of bloodshed and barbarism,\r\ninventing poison gases and every type of diabolic suggestion to\r\nfacilitate killing and starvation. Blockades are enforced to weaken and\r\nstarve civilian populations--women and children. This accomplished, the\r\npendulum of mob passion swings back to the opposite extreme, and\r\nthe compensatory emotions express themselves in hysterical fashion.\r\nPhilanthropy and charity are then unleashed. We begin to hold human life\r\nsacred again. We try to save the lives of the people we formerly\r\nsought to weaken by devastation, disease and starvation. We indulge in\r\n\"drives,\" in campaigns of relief, in a general orgy of international\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nWe are thus witnessing to-day the inauguration of a vast system of\r\ninternational charity. As in our more limited communities and cities,\r\nwhere self-sustaining and self-reliant sections of the population are\r\nforced to shoulder the burden of the reckless and irresponsible, so\r\nin the great world community the more prosperous and incidentally less\r\npopulous nations are asked to relieve and succor those countries which\r\nare either the victims of the wide-spread havoc of war, of militaristic\r\nstatesmanship, or of the age-long tradition of reckless propagation and\r\nits consequent over-population.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have recently been called upon to\r\nexercise their traditional generosity not merely to aid the European\r\nRelief Council in its efforts to keep alive three million, five hundred\r\nthousand starving children in Central Europe, but in addition to\r\ncontribute to that enormous fund to save the thirty million Chinese\r\nwho find themselves at the verge of starvation, owing to one of those\r\nrecurrent famines which strike often at that densely populated and inert\r\ncountry, where procreative recklessness is encouraged as a matter of\r\nduty. The results of this international charity have not justified the\r\neffort nor repaid the generosity to which it appealed. In the first\r\nplace, no effort was made to prevent the recurrence of the disaster; in\r\nthe second place, philanthropy of this type attempts to sweep back the\r\ntide of miseries created by unrestricted propagation, with the feeble\r\nbroom of sentiment. As one of the most observant and impartial of\r\nauthorities on the Far East, J. O. P. Bland, has pointed out: \"So long\r\nas China maintains a birth-rate that is estimated at fifty-five per\r\nthousand or more, the only possible alternative to these visitations\r\nwould be emigration and this would have to be on such a scale as would\r\nspeedily overrun and overfill the habitable globe. Neither humanitarian\r\nschemes, international charities nor philanthropies can prevent\r\nwidespread disaster to a people which habitually breeds up to and\r\nbeyond the maximum limits of its food supply.\" Upon this point, it is\r\ninteresting to add, Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip has likewise pointed out the\r\ninefficacy and misdirection of this type of international charity.(1)\r\n\r\nMr. Bland further points out: \"The problem presented is one with which\r\nneither humanitarian nor religious zeal can ever cope, so long as we\r\nfail to recognize and attack the fundamental cause of these calamities.\r\nAs a matter of sober fact, the benevolent activities of our missionary\r\nsocieties to reduce the deathrate by the prevention of infanticide and\r\nthe checking of disease, actually serve in the end to aggravate the\r\npressure of population upon its food-supply and to increase the\r\nseverity of the inevitably resultant catastrophe. What is needed for\r\nthe prevention, or, at least, the mitigation of these scourges, is an\r\norganized educational propaganda, directed first against polygamy\r\nand the marriage of minors and the unfit, and, next, toward such a\r\nlimitation of the birth-rate as shall approximate the standard\r\nof civilized countries. But so long as Bishops and well meaning\r\nphilanthropists in England and America continue to praise and encourage\r\n`the glorious fertility of the East' there can be but little hope of\r\nminimizing the penalties of the ruthless struggle for existence in\r\nChina, and Nature's law will therefore continue to work out its own\r\npitiless solution, weeding out every year millions of predestined\r\nweaklings.\"\r\n\r\nThis rapid survey is enough, I hope, to indicate the manifold\r\ninadequacies inherent in present policies of philanthropy and charity.\r\nThe most serious charge that can be brought against modern \"benevolence\"\r\nis that it encourages the perpetuation of defectives, delinquents\r\nand dependents. These are the most dangerous elements in the world\r\ncommunity, the most devastating curse on human progress and expression.\r\nPhilanthropy is a gesture characteristic of modern business lavishing\r\nupon the unfit the profits extorted from the community at large. Looked\r\nat impartially, this compensatory generosity is in its final effect\r\nprobably more dangerous, more dysgenic, more blighting than the initial\r\npractice of profiteering and the social injustice which makes some too\r\nrich and others too poor.\r\n\r\n     (1)  Birth Control Review.  Vol. V. No. 4. p. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: Neglected Factors of the World Problem\r\n\r\nWar has thrust upon us a new internationalism. To-day the world is\r\nunited by starvation, disease and misery. We are enjoying the ironic\r\ninternationalism of hatred. The victors are forced to shoulder the\r\nburden of the vanquished. International philanthropies and charities are\r\norganized. The great flux of immigration and emigration has recommenced.\r\nProsperity is a myth; and the rich are called upon to support huge\r\nphilanthropies, in the futile attempt to sweep back the tide of famine\r\nand misery. In the face of this new internationalism, this tangled unity\r\nof the world, all proposed political and economic programs reveal a\r\nwoeful common bankruptcy. They are fragmentary and superficial. None\r\nof them go to the root of this unprecedented world problem. Politicians\r\noffer political solutions,--like the League of Nations or the limitation\r\nof navies. Militarists offer new schemes of competitive armament.\r\nMarxians offer the Third Internationale and industrial revolution.\r\nSentimentalists offer charity and philanthropy. Coordination or\r\ncorrelation is lacking. And matters go steadily from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nThe first essential in the solution of any problem is the recognition\r\nand statement of the factors involved. Now in this complex problem\r\nwhich to-day confronts us, no attempt has been made to state the primary\r\nfacts. The statesman believes they are all political. Militarists\r\nbelieve they are all military and naval. Economists, including under the\r\nterm the various schools for Socialists, believe they are industrial and\r\nfinancial. Churchmen look upon them as religious and ethical. What is\r\nlacking is the recognition of that fundamental factor which reflects and\r\ncoordinates these essential but incomplete phases of the problem,--the\r\nfactor of reproduction. For in all problems affecting the welfare of a\r\nbiological species, and particularly in all problems of human welfare,\r\ntwo fundamental forces work against each other. There is hunger as\r\nthe driving force of all our economic, industrial and commercial\r\norganizations; and there is the reproductive impulse in continual\r\nconflict with our economic, political settlements, race adjustments and\r\nthe like. Official moralists, statesmen, politicians, philanthropists\r\nand economists display an astounding disregard of this second\r\ndisorganizing factor. They treat the world of men as if it were purely\r\na hunger world instead of a hunger-sex world. Yet there is no phase of\r\nhuman society, no question of politics, economics, or industry that is\r\nnot tied up in almost equal measure with the expression of both of\r\nthese primordial impulses. You cannot sweep back overpowering dynamic\r\ninstincts by catchwords. You can neglect and thwart sex only at your\r\nperil. You cannot solve the problem of hunger and ignore the problem of\r\nsex. They are bound up together.\r\n\r\nWhile the gravest attention is paid to the problem of hunger and food,\r\nthat of sex is neglected. Politicians and scientists are ready\r\nand willing to speak of such things as a \"high birth rate,\" infant\r\nmortality, the dangers of immigration or over-population. But with few\r\nexceptions they cannot bring themselves to speak of Birth Control. Until\r\nthey shall have broken through the traditional inhibitions concerning\r\nthe discussion of sexual matters, until they recognize the force of the\r\nsexual instinct, and until they recognize Birth Control as the PIVOTAL\r\nFACTOR in the problem confronting the world to-day, our statesmen must\r\ncontinue to work in the dark. Political palliatives will be mocked\r\nby actuality. Economic nostrums are blown willy-nilly in the unending\r\nbattle of human instincts.\r\n\r\nA brief survey of the past three or four centuries of Western\r\ncivilization suggests the urgent need of a new science to help humanity\r\nin the struggle with the vast problem of to-day's disorder and danger.\r\nThat problem, as we envisage it, is fundamentally a sexual problem.\r\nEthical, political, and economic avenues of approach are insufficient.\r\nWe must create a new instrument, a new technique to make any adequate\r\nsolution possible.\r\n\r\nThe history of the industrial revolution and the dominance of\r\nall-conquering machinery in Western civilization show the inadequacy of\r\npolitical and economic measures to meet the terrific rise in population.\r\nThe advent of the factory system, due especially to the development\r\nof machinery at the beginning of the nineteenth century, upset all the\r\ngrandiloquent theories of the previous era. To meet the new situation\r\ncreated by the industrial revolution arose the new science of \"political\r\neconomy,\" or economics. Old political methods proved inadequate to keep\r\npace with the problem presented by the rapid rise of the new machine and\r\nindustrial power. The machine era very shortly and decisively exploded\r\nthe simple belief that \"all men are born free and equal.\" Political\r\npower was superseded by economic and industrial power. To sustain their\r\nsupremacy in the political field, governments and politicians allied\r\nthemselves to the new industrial oligarchy. Old political theories and\r\npractices were totally inadequate to control the new situation or to\r\nmeet the complex problems that grew out of it.\r\n\r\nJust as the eighteenth century saw the rise and proliferation\r\nof political theories, the nineteenth witnessed the creation and\r\ndevelopment of the science of economics, which aimed to perfect an\r\ninstrument for the study and analysis of an industrial society, and\r\nto offer a technique for the solution of the multifold problems it\r\npresented. But at the present moment, as the outcome of the machine\r\nera and competitive populations, the world has been thrown into a new\r\nsituation, the solution of which is impossible solely by political or\r\neconomic weapons.\r\n\r\nThe industrial revolution and the development of machinery in Europe and\r\nAmerica called into being a new type of working-class. Machines were\r\nat first termed \"labor-saving devices.\" In reality, as we now know,\r\nmechanical inventions and discoveries created unprecedented and\r\nincreasingly enormous demand for \"labor.\" The omnipresent and still\r\nexisting scandal of child labor is ample evidence of this. Machine\r\nproduction in its opening phases, demanded large, concentrated and\r\nexploitable populations. Large production and the huge development of\r\ninternational trade through improved methods of transport, made\r\npossible the maintenance upon a low level of existence of these rapidly\r\nincreasing proletarian populations. With the rise and spread throughout\r\nEurope and America of machine production, it is now possible to\r\ncorrelate the expansion of the \"proletariat.\" The working-classes bred\r\nalmost automatically to meet the demand for machine-serving \"hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe rise in population, the multiplication of proletarian populations as\r\na first result of mechanical industry, the appearance of great centers\r\nof population, the so-called urban drift, and the evils of overcrowding\r\nstill remain insufficiently studied and stated. It is a significant\r\nthough neglected fact that when, after long agitation in Great Britain,\r\nchild labor was finally forbidden by law, the supply of children dropped\r\nappreciably. No longer of economic value in the factory, children were\r\nevidently a drug in the \"home.\" Yet it is doubly significant that\r\nfrom this moment British labor began the long unending task of\r\nself-organization.(1)\r\n\r\nNineteenth century economics had no method of studying the interrelation\r\nof the biological factors with the industrial. Overcrowding, overwork,\r\nthe progressive destruction of responsibility by the machine discipline,\r\nas is now perfectly obvious, had the most disastrous consequences upon\r\nhuman character and human habits.(2) Paternalistic philanthropies and\r\nsentimental charities, which sprang up like mushrooms, only tended to\r\nincrease the evils of indiscriminate breeding. From the physiological\r\nand psychological point of view, the factory system has been nothing\r\nless than catastrophic.\r\n\r\nDr. Austin Freeman has recently pointed out (3) some of the\r\nphysiological, psychological, and racial effects of machinery upon the\r\nproletariat, the breeders of the world. Speaking for Great Britain, Dr.\r\nFreeman suggests that the omnipresence of machinery tends toward the\r\nproduction of large but inferior populations. Evidences of biological\r\nand racial degeneracy are apparent to this observer. \"Compared with the\r\nAfrican negro,\" he writes, \"the British sub-man is in several respects\r\nmarkedly inferior. He tends to be dull; he is usually quite helpless\r\nand unhandy; he has, as a rule, no skill or knowledge of handicraft,\r\nor indeed knowledge of any kind.... Over-population is a phenomenon\r\nconnected with the survival of the unfit, and it is mechanism which\r\nhas created conditions favorable to the survival of the unfit and the\r\nelimination of the fit.\" The whole indictment against machinery is\r\nsummarized by Dr. Freeman: \"Mechanism by its reactions on man and his\r\nenvironment is antagonistic to human welfare. It has destroyed industry\r\nand replaced it by mere labor; it has degraded and vulgarized the\r\nworks of man; it has destroyed social unity and replaced it by social\r\ndisintegration and class antagonism to an extent which directly\r\nthreatens civilization; it has injuriously affected the structural\r\ntype of society by developing its organization at the expense of the\r\nindividual; it has endowed the inferior man with political power which\r\nhe employs to the common disadvantage by creating political institutions\r\nof a socially destructive type; and finally by its reactions on the\r\nactivities of war it constitutes an agent for the wholesale physical\r\ndestruction of man and his works and the extinction of human culture.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to be in absolute agreement with this diagnostician\r\nto realize the menace of machinery, which tends to emphasize quantity\r\nand mere number at the expense of quality and individuality. One thing\r\nis certain. If machinery is detrimental to biological fitness, the\r\nmachine must be destroyed, as it was in Samuel Butler's \"Erewhon.\" But\r\nperhaps there is another way of mastering this problem.\r\n\r\nAltruism, humanitarianism and philanthropy have aided and abetted\r\nmachinery in the destruction of responsibility and self-reliance among\r\nthe least desirable elements of the proletariat. In contrast with\r\nthe previous epoch of discovery of the New World, of exploration\r\nand colonization, when a centrifugal influence was at work upon the\r\npopulations of Europe, the advent of machinery has brought with it a\r\ncounteracting centripetal effect. The result has been the accumulation\r\nof large urban populations, the increase of irresponsibility, and\r\never-widening margin of biological waste.\r\n\r\nJust as eighteenth century politics and political theories were unable\r\nto keep pace with the economic and capitalistic aggressions of the\r\nnineteenth century, so also we find, if we look closely enough, that\r\nnineteenth century economics is inadequate to lead the world out of the\r\ncatastrophic situation into which it has been thrown by the debacle\r\nof the World War. Economists are coming to recognize that the purely\r\neconomic interpretation of contemporary events is insufficient. Too\r\nlong, as one of them has stated, orthodox economists have overlooked\r\nthe important fact that \"human life is dynamic, that change, movement,\r\nevolution, are its basic characteristics; that self-expression, and\r\ntherefore freedom of choice and movement, are prerequisites to a\r\nsatisfying human state\".(4)\r\n\r\nEconomists themselves are breaking with the old \"dismal science\" of the\r\nManchester school, with its sterile study of \"supply and demand,\"\r\nof prices and exchange, of wealth and labor. Like the Chicago Vice\r\nCommission, nineteenth-century economists (many of whom still survive\r\ninto our own day) considered sex merely as something to be legislated\r\nout of existence. They had the right idea that wealth consisted solely\r\nof material things used to promote the welfare of certain human beings.\r\nTheir idea of capital was somewhat confused. They apparently decided\r\nthat capital was merely that part of capital used to produce profit.\r\nPrices, exchanges, commercial statistics, and financial operations\r\ncomprised the subject matter of these older economists. It would have\r\nbeen considered \"unscientific\" to take into account the human factors\r\ninvolved. They might study the wear-and-tear and depreciation of\r\nmachinery: but the depreciation or destruction of the human race did\r\nnot concern them. Under \"wealth\" they never included the vast, wasted\r\ntreasury of human life and human expression.\r\n\r\nEconomists to-day are awake to the imperative duty of dealing with the\r\nwhole of human nature, with the relation of men, women, and children to\r\ntheir environment--physical and psychic as well as social; of dealing\r\nwith all those factors which contribute to human sustenance, happiness\r\nand welfare. The economist, at length, investigates human motives.\r\nEconomics outgrows the outworn metaphysical preconceptions of nineteenth\r\ncentury theory. To-day we witness the creation of a new \"welfare\" or\r\nsocial economics, based on a fuller and more complete knowledge of the\r\nhuman race, upon a recognition of sex as well as of hunger; in brief, of\r\nphysiological instincts and psychological demands. The newer economists\r\nare beginning to recognize that their science heretofore failed to take\r\ninto account the most vital factors in modern industry--it failed\r\nto foresee the inevitable consequences of compulsory motherhood; the\r\ncatastrophic effects of child labor upon racial health; the overwhelming\r\nimportance of national vitality and well-being; the international\r\nramifications of the population problem; the relation of indiscriminate\r\nbreeding to feeble-mindedness, and industrial inefficiency. It\r\nspeculated too little or not at all on human motives. Human nature riots\r\nthrough the traditional economic structure, as Carlton Parker pointed\r\nout, with ridicule and destruction; the old-fashioned economist looked\r\non helpless and aghast.\r\n\r\nInevitably we are driven to the conclusion that the exhaustively\r\neconomic interpretation of contemporary history is inadequate to\r\nmeet the present situation. In his suggestive book, \"The Acquisitive\r\nSociety,\" R. H. Tawney, arrives at the conclusion that \"obsession\r\nby economic issues is as local and transitory as it is repulsive and\r\ndisturbing. To future generations it will appear as pitiable as the\r\nobsession of the seventeenth century by religious quarrels appears\r\nto-day; indeed, it is less rational, since the object with which it is\r\nconcerned is less important. And it is a poison which inflames every\r\nwound and turns each trivial scratch into a malignant ulcer. Society\r\nwill not solve the particular problems of industry until that poison is\r\nexpelled, and it has learned to see industry in its proper perspective.\r\nIF IT IS TO DO THAT IT MUST REARRANGE THE SCALE OF VALUES. It must\r\nregard economic interests as one element in life, not as the whole of\r\nlife....\"(5)\r\n\r\nIn neglecting or minimizing the great factor of sex in human society,\r\nthe Marxian doctrine reveals itself as no stronger than orthodox\r\neconomics in guiding our way to a sound civilization. It works within\r\nthe same intellectual limitations. Much as we are indebted to the\r\nMarxians for pointing out the injustice of modern industrialism, we\r\nshould never close our eyes to the obvious limitations of their own\r\n\"economic interpretation of history.\" While we must recognize the great\r\nhistorical value of Marx, it is now evident that his vision of the\r\n\"class struggle,\" of the bitter irreconcilable warfare between the\r\ncapitalist and working classes was based not upon historical analysis,\r\nbut upon on unconscious dramatization of a superficial aspect of\r\ncapitalistic regime.\r\n\r\nIn emphasizing the conflict between the classes, Marx failed to\r\nrecognize the deeper unity of the proletariat and the capitalist.\r\nNineteenth century capitalism had in reality engendered and cultivated\r\nthe very type of working class best suited to its own purpose--an inert,\r\ndocile, irresponsible and submissive class, progressively incapable\r\nof effective and aggressive organization. Like the economists of the\r\nManchester school, Marx failed to recognize the interplay of human\r\ninstincts in the world of industry. All the virtues were embodied in the\r\nbeloved proletariat; all the villainies in the capitalists. The greatest\r\nasset of the capitalism of that age was, as a matter of fact, the\r\nuncontrolled breeding among the laboring classes. The intelligent and\r\nself-conscious section of the workers was forced to bear the burden of\r\nthe unemployed and the poverty-stricken.\r\n\r\nMarx was fully aware of the consequences of this condition of things,\r\nbut shut his eyes tightly to the cause. He pointed out that capitalistic\r\npower was dependent upon \"the reserve army of labor,\" surplus labor,\r\nand a wide margin of unemployment. He practically admitted that\r\nover-population was the inevitable soil of predatory capitalism. But he\r\ndisregarded the most obvious consequence of that admission. It was all\r\nvery dramatic and grandiloquent to tell the workingmen of the world to\r\nunite, that they had \"nothing but their chains to lose and the world\r\nto gain.\" Cohesion of any sort, united and voluntary organization, as\r\nevents have proved, is impossible in populations bereft of intelligence,\r\nself-discipline and even the material necessities of life, and cheated\r\nby their desires and ignorance into unrestrained and uncontrolled\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nIn pointing out the limitations and fallacies of the orthodox Marxian\r\nopinion, my purpose is not to depreciate the efforts of the Socialists\r\naiming to create a new society, but rather to emphasize what seems to me\r\nthe greatest and most neglected truth of our day:--Unless sexual science\r\nis incorporated as an integral part of world-statesmanship and the\r\npivotal importance of Birth Control is recognized in any program of\r\nreconstruction, all efforts to create a new world and a new civilization\r\nare foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nWe can hope for no advance until we attain a new conception of sex, not\r\nas a merely propagative act, not merely as a biological necessity for\r\nthe perpetuation of the race, but as a psychic and spiritual avenue of\r\nexpression. It is the limited, inhibited conception of sex that vitiates\r\nso much of the thought and ideation of the Eugenists.\r\n\r\nLike most of our social idealists, statesmen, politicians and\r\neconomists, some of the Eugenists suffer intellectually from a\r\nrestricted and inhibited understanding of the function of sex. This\r\nlimited understanding, this narrowness of vision, which gives rise to\r\nmost of the misconceptions and condemnations of the doctrine of Birth\r\nControl, is responsible or the failure of politicians and legislators to\r\nenact practical statutes or to remove traditional obscenities from the\r\nlaw books. The most encouraging sign at present is the recognition by\r\nmodern psychology of the central importance of the sexual instinct in\r\nhuman society, and the rapid spread of this new concept among the more\r\nenlightened sections of the civilized communities. The new conception\r\nof sex has been well stated by one to whom the debt of contemporary\r\ncivilization is well-nigh immeasurable. \"Sexual activity,\" Havelock\r\nEllis has written, \"is not merely a baldly propagative act, nor, when\r\npropagation is put aside, is it merely the relief of distended\r\nvessels. It is something more even than the foundation of great social\r\ninstitutions. It is the function by which all the finer activities of\r\nthe organism, physical and psychic, may be developed and satisfied.\"(6)\r\n\r\nNo less than seventy years ago, a profound but neglected thinker, George\r\nDrysdale, emphasized the necessity of a thorough understanding of man's\r\nsexual nature in approaching economic, political and social problems.\r\n\"Before we can undertake the calm and impartial investigation of any\r\nsocial problem, we must first of all free ourselves from all those\r\nsexual prejudices which are so vehement and violent and which so\r\ncompletely distort our vision of the external world. Society as a whole\r\nhas yet to fight its way through an almost impenetrable forest of sexual\r\ntaboos.\" Drysdale's words have lost none of their truth even to-day:\r\n\"There are few things from which humanity has suffered more than the\r\ndegraded and irreverent feelings of mystery and shame that have been\r\nattached to the genital and excretory organs. The former have been\r\nregarded, like their corresponding mental passions, as something of a\r\nlower and baser nature, tending to degrade and carnalize man by their\r\nphysical appetites. But we cannot take a debasing view of any part of\r\nour humanity without becoming degraded in our whole being.\"(7)\r\n\r\nDrysdale moreover clearly recognized the social crime of entrusting to\r\nsexual barbarians the duty of legislating and enforcing laws detrimental\r\nto the welfare of all future generations. \"They trust blindly to\r\nauthority for the rules they blindly lay down,\" he wrote, \"perfectly\r\nunaware of the awful and complicated nature of the subject they are\r\ndealing with so confidently and of the horrible evils their unconsidered\r\nstatements are attended with. They themselves break through the most\r\nfundamentally important laws daily in utter unconsciousness of the\r\nmisery they are causing to their fellows....\"\r\n\r\nPsychologists to-day courageously emphasize the integral relationship\r\nof the expression of the sexual instinct with every phase of human\r\nactivity. Until we recognize this central fact, we cannot understand the\r\nimplications and the sinister significance of superficial attempts\r\nto apply rosewater remedies to social evils,--by the enactment of\r\nrestrictive and superficial legislation, by wholesale philanthropies and\r\ncharities, by publicly burying our heads in the sands of sentimentality.\r\nSelf-appointed censors, grossly immoral \"moralists,\" makeshift\r\nlegislators, all face a heavy responsibility for the miseries, diseases,\r\nand social evils they perpetuate or intensify by enforcing the primitive\r\ntaboos of aboriginal customs, traditions, and outworn laws, which\r\nat every step hinder the education of the people in the scientific\r\nknowledge of their sexual nature. Puritanic and academic taboo of sex in\r\neducation and religion is as disastrous to human welfare as prostitution\r\nor the venereal scourges. \"We are compelled squarely to face the\r\ndistorting influences of biologically aborted reformers as well as the\r\nwastefulness of seducers,\" Dr. Edward A. Kempf recently declared. \"Man\r\narose from the ape and inherited his passions, which he can only refine\r\nbut dare not attempt to castrate unless he would destroy the fountains\r\nof energy that maintain civilization and make life worth living and the\r\nworld worth beautifying.... We do not have a problem that is to be solved\r\nby making repressive laws and executing them. Nothing will be more\r\ndisastrous. Society must make life worth the living and the refining for\r\nthe individual by conditioning him to love and to seek the love-object\r\nin a manner that reflects a constructive effect upon his fellow-men\r\nand by giving him suitable opportunities. The virility of the automatic\r\napparatus is destroyed by excessive gormandizing or hunger, by excessive\r\nwealth or poverty, by excessive work or idleness, by sexual abuse or\r\nintolerant prudishness. The noblest and most difficult art of all is the\r\nraising of human thoroughbreds.\"(8)\r\n\r\n     (1)  It may be well to note, in this connection, that the\r\n     decline in the birth rate among the more intelligent classes\r\n     of British labor followed upon the famous Bradlaugh-Besant\r\n     trial of 1878, the outcome of the attempt of these two\r\n     courageous Birth Control pioneers to circulate among the\r\n     workers the work of an American physician, Dr. Knowlton's\r\n     \"The Fruits of Philosophy,\" advocating Birth Control, and\r\n     the widespread publicity resulting from his trial.\r\n\r\n     (2)  Cf.

New York, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: Is Revolution the Remedy?\r\n\r\nMarxian Socialism, which seeks to solve the complex problem of human\r\nmisery by economic and proletarian revolution, has manifested a new\r\nvitality. Every shade of Socialistic thought and philosophy acknowledges\r\nits indebtedness to the vision of Karl Marx and his conception of the\r\nclass struggle. Yet the relation of Marxian Socialism to the philosophy\r\nof Birth Control, especially in the minds of most Socialists, remains\r\nhazy and confused. No thorough understanding of Birth Control, its aims\r\nand purposes, is possible until this confusion has been cleared\r\naway, and we come to a realization that Birth Control is not merely\r\nindependent of, but even antagonistic to the Marxian dogma. In recent\r\nyears many Socialists have embraced the doctrine of Birth Control, and\r\nhave generously promised us that \"under Socialism\" voluntary motherhood\r\nwill be adopted and popularized as part of a general educational system.\r\nWe might more logically reply that no Socialism will ever be possible\r\nuntil the problem of responsible parenthood has been solved.\r\n\r\nMany Socialists to-day remain ignorant of the inherent conflict between\r\nthe idea of Birth Control and the philosophy of Marx. The earlier\r\nMarxians, including Karl Marx himself, expressed the bitterest\r\nantagonism to Malthusian and neo-Malthusian theories. A remarkable\r\nfeature of early Marxian propaganda has been the almost complete\r\nunanimity with which the implications of the Malthusian doctrine have\r\nbeen derided, denounced and repudiated. Any defense of the so-called\r\n\"law of population\" was enough to stamp one, in the eyes of the orthodox\r\nMarxians, as a \"tool of the capitalistic class,\" seeking to dampen the\r\nardor of those who expressed the belief that men might create a better\r\nworld for themselves. Malthus, they claimed, was actuated by selfish\r\nclass motives. He was not merely a hidebound aristocrat, but a pessimist\r\nwho was trying to kill all hope of human progress. By Marx, Engels,\r\nBebel, Karl Kautsky, and all the celebrated leaders and interpreters\r\nof Marx's great \"Bible of the working class,\" down to the martyred Rosa\r\nLuxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, Birth Control has been looked upon as a\r\nsubtle, Machiavellian sophistry created for the purpose of placing the\r\nblame for human misery elsewhere than at the door of the capitalist\r\nclass. Upon this point the orthodox Marxian mind has been universally\r\nand sternly uncompromising.\r\n\r\nMarxian vituperation of Malthus and his followers is illuminating. It\r\nreveals not the weakness of the thinker attacked, but of the aggressor.\r\nThis is nowhere more evident than in Marx's \"Capital\" itself. In that\r\nmonumental effort, it is impossible to discover any adequate refutation\r\nor even calm discussion of the dangers of irresponsible parenthood\r\nand reckless breeding, any suspicion that this recklessness and\r\nirresponsibility is even remotely related to the miseries of the\r\nproletariat. Poor Malthus is there relegated to the humble level of\r\na footnote. \"If the reader reminds me of Malthus, whose essay on\r\nPopulation appeared in 1798,\" Marx remarks somewhat tartly, \"I\r\nremind him that this work in its first form is nothing more than\r\na schoolboyish, superficial plagiary of De Foe, Sir James Steuart,\r\nTownsend, Franklin, Wallace, etc., and does not contain a single\r\nsentence thought out by himself. The great sensation this pamphlet\r\ncaused was due solely to party interest. The French Revolution had\r\npassionate defenders in the United Kingdom.... `The Principles of\r\nPopulation' was quoted with jubilance by the English oligarchy as the\r\ngreat destroyer of all hankerings after human development.\"(1)\r\n\r\nThe only attempt that Marx makes here toward answering the theory of\r\nMalthus is to declare that most of the population theory teachers were\r\nmerely Protestant parsons.--\"Parson Wallace, Parson Townsend, Parson\r\nMalthus and his pupil the Arch-Parson Thomas Chalmers, to say nothing\r\nof the lesser reverend scribblers in this line.\" The great pioneer of\r\n\"scientific\" Socialism then proceeds to berate parsons as philosophers\r\nand economists, using this method of escape from the very pertinent\r\nquestion of surplus population and surplus proletariat in its relation\r\nto labor organization and unemployment. It is true that elsewhere (2) he\r\ngoes so far as to admit that \"even Malthus recognized over-population\r\nas a necessity of modern industry, though, after his narrow fashion, he\r\nexplains it by the absolute over-growth of the laboring population, not\r\nby their becoming relatively supernumerary.\" A few pages later, however,\r\nMarx comes back again to the question of over-population, failing\r\nto realize that it is to the capitalists' advantage that the working\r\nclasses are unceasingly prolific. \"The folly is now patent,\" writes the\r\nunsuspecting Marx, \"of the economic wisdom that preaches to the laborers\r\nthe accommodation of their numbers to the requirements of capital. The\r\nmechanism of capitalist production and accumulation constantly affects\r\nthis adjustment. The first work of this adaptation is the creation of a\r\nrelatively surplus population or industrial reserve army. Its last work\r\nis the misery of constantly extending strata of the army of labor, and\r\nthe dead weight of pauperism.\" A little later he ventures again in the\r\ndirection of Malthusianism so far as to admit that \"the accumulation\r\nof wealth at one pole is... at the same time the accumulation of misery,\r\nagony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality and mental degradation\r\nat the opposite pole.\" Nevertheless, there is no indication that Marx\r\npermitted himself to see that the proletariat accommodates its numbers\r\nto the \"requirements of capital\" precisely by breeding a large, docile,\r\nsubmissive and easily exploitable population.\r\n\r\nHad the purpose of Marx been impartial and scientific, this trifling\r\ndifference might easily have been overcome and the dangers of reckless\r\nbreeding insisted upon. But beneath all this wordy pretension and\r\neconomic jargon, we detect another aim. That is the unconscious\r\ndramatization of human society into the \"class conflict.\" Nothing was\r\noverlooked that might sharpen and accentuate this \"conflict.\" Marx\r\ndepicted a great melodramatic conflict, in which all the virtues were\r\nembodied in the proletariat and all the villainies in the capitalist.\r\nIn the end, as always in such dramas, virtue was to be rewarded and\r\nvillainy punished. The working class was the temporary victim of a\r\nsubtle but thorough conspiracy of tyranny and repression. Capitalists,\r\nintellectuals and the BOURGEOISIE were all \"in on\" this diabolic\r\nconspiracy, all thoroughly familiar with the plot, which Marx was so\r\nsure he had uncovered. In the last act was to occur that catastrophic\r\nrevolution, with the final transformation scene of the Socialist\r\nmillennium. Presented in \"scientific\" phraseology, with all the authority\r\nof economic terms, \"Capital\" appeared at the psychological moment.\r\nThe heaven of the traditional theology had been shattered by Darwinian\r\nscience, and here, dressed up in all the authority of the new science,\r\nappeared a new theology, the promise of a new heaven, an earthly\r\nparadise, with an impressive scale of rewards for the faithful and\r\nignominious punishments for the capitalists.\r\n\r\nCritics have often been puzzled by the tremendous vitality of this work.\r\nIts predictions have never, despite the claims of the faithful, been\r\nfulfilled. Instead of diminishing, the spirit of nationalism has\r\nbeen intensified tenfold. In nearly every respect Marx's predictions\r\nconcerning the evolution of historical and economic forces have been\r\ncontradicted by events, culminating in the great war. Most of his\r\nfollowers, the \"revolutionary\" Socialists, were swept into the whirlpool\r\nof nationalistic militarism. Nevertheless, this \"Bible of the working\r\nclasses\" still enjoys a tremendous authority as a scientific work. By\r\nsome it is regarded as an economic treatise; by others as a philosophy\r\nof history; by others as a collection of sociological laws; and finally\r\nby others as a moral and political book of reference. Criticized,\r\nrefuted, repudiated and demolished by specialists, it nevertheless\r\nexerts its influences and retains its mysterious vitality.\r\n\r\nWe must seek the explanation of this secret elsewhere. Modern psychology\r\nhas taught us that human nature has a tendency to place the cause of its\r\nown deficiencies and weaknesses outside of itself, to attribute to some\r\nexternal agency, to some enemy or group of enemies, the blame for\r\nits own misery. In his great work Marx unconsciously strengthens\r\nand encourages this tendency. The immediate effect of his teaching,\r\nvulgarized and popularized in a hundred different forms, is to relieve\r\nthe proletariat of all responsibility for the effects of its reckless\r\nbreeding, and even to encourage it in the perpetuation of misery.\r\n\r\nThe inherent truth in the Marxian teachings was, moreover, immediately\r\nsubordinated to their emotional and religious appeal. A book that could\r\nso influence European thought could not be without merit. But in the\r\nprocess of becoming the \"Bible of the working classes,\" \"Capital\"\r\nsuffered the fate of all such \"Bibles.\" The spirit of ecclesiastical\r\ndogmatism was transfused into the religion of revolutionary Socialism.\r\nThis dogmatic religious quality has been noted by many of the most\r\nobservant critics of Socialism. Marx was too readily accepted as the\r\nfather of the church, and \"Capital\" as the sacred gospel of the social\r\nrevolution. All questions of tactics, of propaganda, of class warfare,\r\nof political policy, were to be solved by apt quotations from the \"good\r\nbook.\" New thoughts, new schemes, new programs, based upon tested fact\r\nand experience, the outgrowth of newer discoveries concerning the nature\r\nof men, upon the recognition of the mistakes of the master, could only\r\nbe approved or admitted according as they could or could not be tested\r\nby some bit of text quoted from Marx. His followers assumed that Karl\r\nMarx had completed the philosophy of Socialism, and that the duty of\r\nthe proletariat thenceforth was not to think for itself, but merely to\r\nmobilize itself under competent Marxian leaders for the realization of\r\nhis ideas.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of this apotheosis of Marx until our own, the \"orthodox\"\r\nSocialist of any shade is of the belief that the first essential for\r\nsocial salvation lies in unquestioning belief in the dogmas of Marx.\r\n\r\nThe curious and persistent antagonism to Birth Control that began with\r\nMarx and continues to our own day can be explained only as the utter\r\nrefusal or inability to consider humanity in its physiological and\r\npsychological aspects--these aspects, apparently, having no place in the\r\n\"economic interpretation of history.\" It has remained for George Bernard\r\nShaw, a Socialist with a keener spiritual insight than the\r\nordinary Marxist, to point out the disastrous consequences of rapid\r\nmultiplication which are obvious to the small cultivator, the peasant\r\nproprietor, the lowest farmhand himself, but which seem to arouse the\r\northodox, intellectual Marxian to inordinate fury. \"But indeed the\r\nmore you degrade the workers,\" Shaw once wrote,(3) \"robbing them of all\r\nartistic enjoyment, and all chance of respect and admiration from their\r\nfellows, the more you throw them back, reckless, upon the one pleasure\r\nand the one human tie left to them--the gratification of their instinct\r\nfor producing fresh supplies of men. You will applaud this instinct\r\nas divine until at last the excessive supply becomes a nuisance: there\r\ncomes a plague of men; and you suddenly discover that the instinct is\r\ndiabolic, and set up a cry of `over-population.' But your slaves are\r\nbeyond caring for your cries: they breed like rabbits: and their poverty\r\nbreeds filth, ugliness, dishonesty, disease, obscenity, drunkenness.\"\r\n\r\nLack of insight into fundamental truths of human nature is evident\r\nthroughout the writings of the Marxians. The Marxian Socialists,\r\naccording to Kautsky, defended women in industry: it was right for woman\r\nto work in factories in order to preserve her equality with man! Man\r\nmust not support woman, declared the great French Socialist Guesde,\r\nbecause that would make her the PROLETAIRE of man! Bebel, the great\r\nauthority on woman, famous for his erudition, having critically studied\r\nthe problem of population, suggested as a remedy for too excessive\r\nfecundity the consumption of a certain lard soup reputed to have an\r\n\"anti-generative\" effect upon the agricultural population of Upper\r\nBavaria! Such are the results of the literal and uncritical acceptance\r\nof Marx's static and mechanical conception of human society, a society\r\nperfectly automatic; in which competition is always operating at maximum\r\nefficiency; one vast and unending conspiracy against the blameless\r\nproletariat.\r\n\r\nThis lack of insight of the orthodox Marxians, long represented by\r\nthe German Social-Democrats, is nowhere better illustrated than in Dr.\r\nRobinson's account of a mass meeting of the Social-Democrat party to\r\norganize public opinion against the doctrine of Birth Control among\r\nthe poor.(4) \"Another meeting had taken place the week before, at which\r\nseveral eminent Socialist women, among them Rosa Luxemburg and Clara\r\nZetkin, spoke very strongly against limitation of offspring among the\r\npoor--in fact the title of the discussion was GEGEN DEN GEBURTSTREIK!\r\n`Against the birth strike!' The interest of the audience was intense.\r\nOne could see that with them it was not merely a dialectic question,\r\nas it was with their leaders, but a matter of life and death. I came to\r\nattend a meeting AGAINST the limitation of offspring; it soon proved to\r\nbe a meeting very decidedly FOR the limitation of offspring, for every\r\nspeaker who spoke in favor of the artificial prevention of conception\r\nor undesired pregnancies, was greeted with vociferous, long-lasting\r\napplause; while those who tried to persuade the people that a limited\r\nnumber of children is not a proletarian weapon, and would not improve\r\ntheir lot, were so hissed that they had difficulty going on. The\r\nspeakers who were against the... idea soon felt that their audience\r\nwas against them.... Why was there such small attendance at the regular\r\nSocialistic meetings, while the meetings of this character were packed\r\nto suffocation? It did not apparently penetrate the leaders' heads\r\nthat the reason was a simple one. Those meetings were evidently of\r\nno interest to them, while those which dealt with the limitation of\r\noffspring were of personal, vital, present interest.... What particularly\r\namused me--and pained me--in the anti-limitationists was the ease and\r\nequanimity with which they advised the poor women to keep on bearing\r\nchildren. The woman herself was not taken into consideration, as if she\r\nwas not a human being, but a machine. What are her sufferings, her labor\r\npains, her inability to read, to attend meetings, to have a taste of\r\nlife? What does she amount to? The proletariat needs fighters. Go on,\r\nfemales, and breed like animals. Maybe of the thousands you bear a few\r\nwill become party members....\"\r\n\r\nThe militant organization of the Marxian Socialists suggests that their\r\ncampaign must assume the tactics of militarism of the familiar type. As\r\nrepresented by militaristic governments, militarism like Socialism has\r\nalways encouraged the proletariat to increase and multiply. Imperial\r\nGermany was the outstanding and awful example of this attitude. Before\r\nthe war the fall in the birth-rate was viewed by the Junker party\r\nwith the gravest misgivings. Bernhardi and the protagonists of\r\nDEUTSCHLAND-UBER-ALLES condemned it in the strongest terms. The Marxians\r\nunconsciously repeat the words of the government representative, Krohne,\r\nwho, in a debate on the subject in the Prussian Diet, February 1916,\r\nasserted: \"Unfortunately this view has gained followers amongst the\r\nGerman women.... These women, in refusing to rear strong and able\r\nchildren to continue the race, drag into the dust that which is the\r\nhighest end of women--motherhood. It is to be hoped that the willingness\r\nto bear sacrifices will lead to a change for the better.... We need\r\nan increase in human beings to guard against the attacks of envious\r\nneighbors as well as to fulfil our cultural mission. Our whole economic\r\ndevelopment depends on increase of our people.\" Today we are fully aware\r\nof how imperial Germany fulfilled that cultural mission of hers; nor\r\ncan we overlook the fact that the countries with a smaller birth-rate\r\nsurvived the ordeal. Even from the traditional militaristic standpoint,\r\nstrength does not reside in numbers, though the Caesars, the Napoleons\r\nand the Kaisers of the world have always believed that large exploitable\r\npopulations were necessary for their own individual power. If Marxian\r\ndictatorship means the dictatorship of a small minority wielding power\r\nin the interest of the proletariat, a high-birth rate may be necessary,\r\nthough we may here recall the answer of the lamented Dr. Alfred Fried to\r\nthe German imperialists: \"It is madness, the apotheosis of unreason, to\r\nwish to breed and care for human beings in order that in the flower of\r\ntheir youth they may be sent in millions to be slaughtered wholesale by\r\nmachinery. We need no wholesale production of men, have no need of the\r\n`fruitful fertility of women,' no need of wholesale wares, fattened and\r\ndressed for slaughter What we do need is careful maintenance of those\r\nalready born. If the bearing of children is a moral and religious duty,\r\nthen it is a much higher duty to secure the sacredness and security of\r\nhuman life, so that children born and bred with trouble and sacrifice\r\nmay not be offered up in the bloom of youth to a political dogma at the\r\nbidding of secret diplomacy.\"\r\n\r\nMarxism has developed a patriotism of its own, if indeed it has not yet\r\nbeen completely crystallized into a religion. Like the \"capitalistic\"\r\ngovernments it so vehemently attacks, it demands self-sacrifice and even\r\nmartyrdom from the faithful comrades. But since its strength depends\r\nto so great a degree upon \"conversion,\" upon docile acceptance of the\r\ndoctrines of the \"Master\" as interpreted by the popes and bishops of\r\nthis new church, it fails to arouse the irreligious proletariat.\r\nThe Marxian Socialist boasts of his understanding of \"working class\r\npsychology\" and criticizes the lack of this understanding on the part\r\nof all dissenters. But, as the Socialists' meetings against the\r\n\"birth strike\" indicate, the working class is not interested in such\r\ngeneralities as the Marxian \"theory of value,\" the \"iron law\" of wages,\r\n\"the value of commodities\" and the rest of the hazy articles of faith.\r\nMarx inherited the rigid nationalistic psychology of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and his followers, for the most part, have accepted his\r\nmechanical and superficial treatment of instinct.(5) Discontented\r\nworkers may rally to Marxism because it places the blame for their\r\nmisery outside of themselves and depicts their conditions as the result\r\nof a capitalistic conspiracy, thereby satisfying that innate tendency\r\nof every human being to shift the blame to some living person outside\r\nhimself, and because it strengthens his belief that his sufferings\r\nand difficulties may be overcome by the immediate amelioration of his\r\neconomic environment. In this manner, psychologists tell us, neuroses\r\nand inner compulsions are fostered. No true solution is possible, to\r\ncontinue this analogy, until the worker is awakened to the realization\r\nthat the roots of his malady lie deep in his own nature, his own\r\norganism, his own habits. To blame everything upon the capitalist and\r\nthe environment produced by capitalism is to focus attention upon merely\r\none of the elements of the problem. The Marxian too often forgets\r\nthat before there was a capitalist there was exercised the unlimited\r\nreproductive activity of mankind, which produced the first overcrowding,\r\nthe first want. This goaded humanity into its industrial frenzy, into\r\nwarfare and theft and slavery. Capitalism has not created the lamentable\r\nstate of affairs in which the world now finds itself. It has grown\r\nout of them, armed with the inevitable power to take advantage of our\r\nswarming, spawning millions. As that valiant thinker Monsieur G. Hardy\r\nhas pointed out (6) the proletariat may be looked upon, not as the\r\nantagonist of capitalism, but as its accomplice. Labor surplus, or\r\nthe \"army of reserve\" which as for decades and centuries furnished\r\nthe industrial background of human misery, which so invariably defeats\r\nstrikes and labor revolts, cannot honestly be blamed upon capitalism.\r\nIt is, as M. Hardy points out, of SEXUAL and proletarian origin. In\r\nbringing too many children into the world, in adding to the total of\r\nmisery, in intensifying the evils of overcrowding, the proletariat\r\nitself increases the burden of organized labor; even of the Socialist\r\nand Syndicalist organizations themselves with a surplus of the docilely\r\ninefficient, with those great uneducable and unorganizable masses. With\r\nsurprisingly few exceptions, Marxians of all countries have docilely\r\nfollowed their master in rejecting, with bitterness and vindictiveness\r\nthat is difficult to explain, the principles and teachings of Birth\r\nControl.\r\n\r\nHunger alone is not responsible for the bitter struggle for existence we\r\nwitness to-day in our over-advertised civilization. Sex, uncontrolled,\r\nmisdirected, over-stimulated and misunderstood, has run riot at the\r\ninstigation of priest, militarist and exploiter. Uncontrolled sex has\r\nrendered the proletariat prostrate, the capitalist powerful. In this\r\ncontinuous, unceasing alliance of sexual instinct and hunger we find the\r\nreason for the decline of all the finer sentiments. These instincts tear\r\nasunder the thin veils of culture and hypocrisy and expose to our gaze\r\nthe dark sufferings of gaunt humanity. So have we become familiar with\r\nthe everyday spectacle of distorted bodies, of harsh and frightful\r\ndiseases stalking abroad in the light of day; of misshapen heads and\r\nvisages of moron and imbecile; of starving children in city streets\r\nand schools. This is the true soil of unspeakable crimes. Defect and\r\ndelinquency join hands with disease, and accounts of inconceivable and\r\nrevolting vices are dished up in the daily press. When the majority\r\nof men and women are driven by the grim lash of sex and hunger in the\r\nunending struggle to feed themselves and to carry the dead-weight of\r\ndead and dying progeny, when little children are forced into factories,\r\nstreets, and shops, education--including even education in the Marxian\r\ndogmas--is quite impossible; and civilization is more completely\r\nthreatened than it ever could be by pestilence or war.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be pointed out, the working class has advanced. Power has\r\nbeen acquired by labor unions and syndicates. In the beginning power\r\nwas won by the principle of the restriction of numbers. The device of\r\nrefusing to admit more than a fixed number of new members to the unions\r\nof the various trades has been justified as necessary for the upholding\r\nof the standard of wages and of working conditions. This has been the\r\npractice in precisely those unions which have been able through years\r\nof growth and development to attain tangible strength and power. Such\r\na principle of restriction is necessary in the creation of a firmly and\r\ndeeply rooted trunk or central organization furnishing a local center\r\nfor more extended organization. It is upon this great principle of\r\nrestricted number that the labor unions have generated and developed\r\npower. They have acquired this power without any religious emotionalism,\r\nwithout subscribing to metaphysical or economic theology. For the\r\nmillenium and the earthly paradise to be enjoyed at some indefinitely\r\nfuture date, the union member substitutes the very real politics\r\nof organization with its resultant benefits. He increases his own\r\nindependence and comfort and that of his family. He is immune to\r\nsuperstitious belief in and respect for the mysterious power of\r\npolitical or economic nostrums to reconstruct human society according to\r\nthe Marxian formula.\r\n\r\nIn rejecting the Marxian hypothesis as superficial and fragmentary, we\r\ndo so not because of its so-called revolutionary character, its threat\r\nto the existing order of things, but rather because of its superficial,\r\nemotional and religious character and its deleterious effect upon the\r\nlife of reason. Like other schemes advanced by the alarmed and the\r\nindignant, it relies too much upon moral fervor and enthusiasm. To build\r\nany social program upon the shifting sands of sentiment and feeling, of\r\nindignation or enthusiasm, is a dangerous and foolish task. On the other\r\nhand, we should not minimize the importance of the Socialist movement\r\nin so valiantly and so courageously battling against the stagnating\r\ncomplacency of our conservatives and reactionaries, under whose\r\nbenign imbecility the defective and diseased elements of humanity\r\nare encouraged \"full speed ahead\" in their reckless and irresponsible\r\nswarming and spawning. Nevertheless, as George Drysdale pointed out\r\nnearly seventy years ago;\r\n\r\n\"... If we ignore this and other sexual subjects, we may do whatever else\r\nwe like: we may bully, we may bluster, we may rage, We may foam at\r\nthe mouth; we may tear down Heaven with our prayers, we may exhaust\r\nourselves with weeping over the sorrows of the poor; we may narcotize\r\nourselves and others with the opiate of Christian resignation; we may\r\ndissolve the realities of human woe in a delusive mirage of poetry and\r\nideal philosophy; we may lavish our substance in charity, and labor over\r\npossible or impossible Poor Laws; we may form wild dreams of Socialism,\r\nindustrial regiments, universal brotherhood, red republics, or\r\nunexampled revolutions; we may strangle and murder each other, we may\r\npersecute and despise those whose sexual necessities force them to break\r\nthrough our unnatural moral codes; we may burn alive if we please the\r\nprostitutes and the adulterers; we may break our own and our neighbor's\r\nhearts against the adamantine laws that surround us, but not one step,\r\nnot one shall we advance, till we acknowledge these laws, and adopt\r\nthe only possible mode in which they can be obeyed.\" These words were\r\nwritten in 1854. Recent events have accentuated their stinging truth.\r\n\r\n     (1)  Marx: \"Capital.\"  Vol. I, p. 675.\r\n\r\n     (2)  Op. cit. pp, 695, 707, 709.\r\n\r\n     (3)  Fabian Essays in Socialism.  p. 21.\r\n\r\n     (4)  Uncontrolled Breeding, By Adelyne More.  p. 84.\r\n\r\n     (5)  For a sympathetic treatment of modern psychological\r\n     research as bearing on Communism, by two convinced\r\n     Communists see \"Creative Revolution,\" by Eden and Cedar\r\n     Paul.\r\n\r\n     (6)  Neo-Malthusianisme et Socialisme, p. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: Dangers of Cradle Competition\r\n\r\nEugenics has been defined as \"the study of agencies under social control\r\nthat may improve or impair the racial qualities of future generations,\r\neither mentally or physically.\" While there is no inherent conflict\r\nbetween Socialism and Eugenics, the latter is, broadly, the antithesis\r\nof the former. In its propaganda, Socialism emphasizes the evil effects\r\nof our industrial and economic system. It insists upon the necessity of\r\nsatisfying material needs, upon sanitation, hygiene, and education to\r\neffect the transformation of society. The Socialist insists that healthy\r\nhumanity is impossible without a radical improvement of the social--and\r\ntherefore of the economic and industrial--environment. The Eugenist\r\npoints out that heredity is the great determining factor in the lives\r\nof men and women. Eugenics is the attempt to solve the problem from the\r\nbiological and evolutionary point of view. You may bring all the changes\r\npossible on \"Nurture\" or environment, the Eugenist may say to the\r\nSocialist, but comparatively little can be effected until you control\r\nbiological and hereditary elements of the problem. Eugenics thus aims\r\nto seek out the root of our trouble, to study humanity as a kinetic,\r\ndynamic, evolutionary organism, shifting and changing with the\r\nsuccessive generations, rising and falling, cleansing itself of\r\ninherent defects, or under adverse and dysgenic influences, sinking into\r\ndegeneration and deterioration.\r\n\r\n\"Eugenics\" was first defined by Sir Francis Galton in his \"Human\r\nFaculty\" in 1884, and was subsequently developed into a science and into\r\nan educational effort. Galton's ideal was the rational breeding of human\r\nbeings. The aim of Eugenics, as defined by its founder, is to bring\r\nas many influences as can be reasonably employed, to cause the useful\r\nclasses of the community to contribute MORE than their proportion to the\r\nnext generation. Eugenics thus concerns itself with all influences that\r\nimprove the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop\r\nthem to the utmost advantage. It is, in short, the attempt to bring\r\nreason and intelligence to bear upon HEREDITY. But Galton, in spite\r\nof the immense value of this approach and his great stimulation to\r\ncriticism, was completely unable to formulate a definite and practical\r\nworking program. He hoped at length to introduce Eugenics \"into the\r\nnational conscience like a new religion.... I see no impossibility in\r\nEugenics becoming a religious dogma among mankind, but its details must\r\nfirst be worked out sedulously in the study. Over-zeal leading to hasty\r\naction, would do harm by holding out expectations of a new golden\r\nage, which will certainly be falsified and cause the science to\r\nbe discredited. The first and main point is to secure the general\r\nintellectual acceptance of Eugenics as a hopeful and most important\r\nstudy. Then, let its principles work into the heart of the nation, who\r\nwill gradually give practical effect to them in ways that we may not\r\nwholly foresee.\"(1)\r\n\r\nGalton formulated a general law of inheritance which declared that an\r\nindividual receives one-half of his inheritance from his two\r\nparents, one-fourth from his four grandparents, one-eighth from his\r\ngreat-grandparents, one-sixteenth from his great-great grandparents, and\r\nso on by diminishing fractions to his primordial ancestors, the sum\r\nof all these fractions added together contributing to the whole of the\r\ninherited make-up. The trouble with this generalization, from the modern\r\nMendelian point of view, is that it fails to define what \"characters\"\r\none would get in the one-half that came from one's parents, or the\r\none-fourth from one's grandparents. The whole of our inheritance is\r\nnot composed of these indefinitely made up fractional parts. We are\r\ninterested rather in those more specific traits or characters, mental\r\nor physical, which, in the Mendelian view, are structural and functional\r\nunits, making up a mosaic rather than a blend. The laws of heredity are\r\nconcerned with the precise behavior, during a series of generations, of\r\nthese specific unit characters. This behavior, as the study of Genetics\r\nshows, may be determined in lesser organisms by experiment. Once\r\ndetermined, they are subject to prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe problem of human heredity is now seen to be infinitely more complex\r\nthan imagined by Galton and his followers, and the optimistic hope of\r\nelevating Eugenics to the level of a religion is a futile one. Most of\r\nthe Eugenists, including Professor Karl Pearson and his colleagues of\r\nthe Eugenics Laboratory of the University of London and of the biometric\r\nlaboratory in University College, have retained the age-old point\r\nof view of \"Nature vs. Nurture\" and have attempted to show the\r\npredominating influence of Heredity AS OPPOSED TO Environment. This\r\nmay be true; but demonstrated and repeated in investigation after\r\ninvestigation, it nevertheless remains fruitless and unprofitable from\r\nthe practical point of view.\r\n\r\nWe should not minimize the great outstanding service of Eugenics for\r\ncritical and diagnostic investigations. It demonstrates, not in terms of\r\nglittering generalization but in statistical studies of investigations\r\nreduced to measurement and number, that uncontrolled fertility is\r\nuniversally correlated with disease, poverty, overcrowding and the\r\ntransmission of hereditable taints. Professor Pearson and his associates\r\nshow us that \"if fertility be correlated with anti-social hereditary\r\ncharacters, a population will inevitably degenerate.\"\r\n\r\nThis degeneration has already begun. Eugenists demonstrate that\r\ntwo-thirds of our manhood of military age are physically too unfit\r\nto shoulder a rifle; that the feeble-minded, the syphilitic, the\r\nirresponsible and the defective breed unhindered; that women are driven\r\ninto factories and shops on day-shift and night-shift; that children,\r\nfrail carriers of the torch of life, are put to work at an early\r\nage; that society at large is breeding an ever-increasing army of\r\nunder-sized, stunted and dehumanized slaves; that the vicious circle of\r\nmental and physical defect, delinquency and beggary is encouraged,\r\nby the unseeing and unthinking sentimentality of our age, to populate\r\nasylum, hospital and prison.\r\n\r\nAll these things the Eugenists sees and points out with a courage\r\nentirely admirable. But as a positive program of redemption, orthodox\r\nEugenics can offer nothing more \"constructive\" than a renewed \"cradle\r\ncompetition\" between the \"fit\" and the \"unfit.\" It sees that the\r\nmost responsible and most intelligent members of society are the less\r\nfertile; that the feeble-minded are the more fertile. Herein lies the\r\nunbalance, the great biological menace to the future of civilization.\r\nAre we heading to biological destruction, toward the gradual but certain\r\nattack upon the stocks of intelligence and racial health by the sinister\r\nforces of the hordes of irresponsibility and imbecility? This is not\r\nsuch a remote danger as the optimistic Eugenist might suppose. The\r\nmating of the moron with a person of sound stock may, as Dr. Tredgold\r\npoints out, gradually disseminate this trait far and wide until it\r\nundermines the vigor and efficiency of an entire nation and an entire\r\nrace. This is no idle fancy. We must take it into account if we wish to\r\nescape the fate that has befallen so many civilizations in the past.\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed, more than likely that the presence of this impairment\r\nin a mitigated form is responsible for no little of the defective\r\ncharacter, the diminution of mental and moral fiber at the present day,\"\r\nstates Dr. Tredgold.(2) Such populations, this distinguished authority\r\nmight have added, form the veritable \"cultures\" not only for contagious\r\nphysical diseases but for mental instability and irresponsibility also.\r\nThey are susceptible, exploitable, hysterical, non-resistant to external\r\nsuggestion. Devoid of stamina, such folk become mere units in a mob.\r\n\"The habit of crowd-making is daily becoming a more serious menace to\r\ncivilization,\" writes Everett Dean Martin. \"Our society is becoming\r\na veritable babel of gibbering crowds.\"(3) It would be only the\r\nincorrigible optimist who refused to see the integral relation between\r\nthis phenomenon and the indiscriminate breeding by which we recruit our\r\nlarge populations.\r\n\r\nThe danger of recruiting our numbers from the most \"fertile stocks\" is\r\nfurther emphasized when we recall that in a democracy like that of the\r\nUnited States every man and woman is permitted a vote in the government,\r\nand that it is the representatives of this grade of intelligence who may\r\ndestroy our liberties, and who may thus be the most far-reaching peril\r\nto the future of civilization.\r\n\r\n\"It is a pathological worship of mere number,\" writes Alleyne Ireland,\r\n\"which has inspired all the efforts--the primary, the direct election\r\nof Senators, the initiative, the recall and the referendum--to cure the\r\nevils of mob rule by increasing the size of the mob and extending its\r\npowers.\"(4)\r\n\r\nEquality of political power has thus been bestowed upon the lowest\r\nelements of our population. We must not be surprised, therefore, at\r\nthe spectacle of political scandal and graft, of the notorious and\r\nuniversally ridiculed low level of intelligence and flagrant stupidity\r\nexhibited by our legislative bodies. The Congressional Record mirrors\r\nour political imbecility.\r\n\r\nAll of these dangers and menaces are acutely realized by the Eugenists;\r\nit is to them that we are most indebted for the proof that reckless\r\nspawning carries with it the seeds of destruction. But whereas the\r\nGaltonians reveal themselves as unflinching in their investigation and\r\nin their exhibition of fact and diagnoses of symptoms, they do not on\r\nthe other hand show much power in suggesting practical and feasible\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nOn its scientific side, Eugenics suggests the reestabilishment of\r\nthe balance between the fertility of the \"fit\" and the \"unfit.\" The\r\nbirth-rate among the normal and healthier and finer stocks of humanity,\r\nis to be increased by awakening among the \"fit\" the realization of the\r\ndangers of a lessened birth-rate in proportion to the reckless breeding\r\namong the \"unfit.\" By education, by persuasion, by appeals to racial\r\nethics and religious motives, the ardent Eugenist hopes to increase the\r\nfertility of the \"fit.\" Professor Pearson thinks that it is especially\r\nnecessary to awaken the hardiest stocks to this duty. These stocks,\r\nhe says, are to be found chiefly among the skilled artisan class, the\r\nintelligent working class. Here is a fine combination of health and\r\nhardy vigor, of sound body and sound mind.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pearson and his school of biometrics here ignore or at least\r\nfail to record one of those significant \"correlations\" which form the\r\nbasis of his method. The publications of the Eugenics Laboratory all\r\ntend to show that a high rate of fertility is correlated with extreme\r\npoverty, recklessness, deficiency and delinquency; similarly, that\r\namong the more intelligent, this rate of fertility decreases. But the\r\nscientific Eugenists fail to recognize that this restraint of fecundity\r\nis due to a deliberate foresight and is a conscious effort to\r\nelevate standards of living for the family and the children of the\r\nresponsible--and possibly more selfish--sections of the community. The\r\nappeal to enter again into competitive child-bearing, for the benefit\r\nof the nation or the race, or any other abstraction, will fall on deaf\r\nears.\r\n\r\nPearson has done invaluable work in pointing out the fallacies and the\r\nfalse conclusions of the ordinary statisticians. But when he attempts to\r\nshow by the methods of biometrics that not only the first child but\r\nalso the second, are especially liable to suffer from transmissible\r\npathological defects, such as insanity, criminality and tuberculosis,\r\nhe fails to recognize that this tendency is counterbalanced by the high\r\nmortality rate among later children. If first and second children reveal\r\na greater percentage of heritable defect, it is because the later born\r\nchildren are less liable to survive the conditions produced by a large\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn passing, we should here recognize the difficulties presented by the\r\nidea of \"fit\" and \"unfit.\" Who is to decide this question? The grosser,\r\nthe more obvious, the undeniably feeble-minded should, indeed, not only\r\nbe discouraged but prevented from propagating their kind. But among the\r\nwritings of the representative Eugenists one cannot ignore the distinct\r\nmiddle-class bias that prevails. As that penetrating critic, F. W.\r\nStella Browne, has said in another connection, \"The Eugenics Education\r\nSociety has among its numbers many most open-minded and truly\r\nprogressive individuals but the official policy it has pursued for years\r\nhas been inspired by class-bias and sex bias. The society laments with\r\nincreasing vehemence the multiplication of the less fortunate classes at\r\na more rapid rate than the possessors of leisure and opportunity. (I do\r\nnot think it relevant here to discuss whether the innate superiority of\r\nendowment in the governing class really is so overwhelming as to justify\r\nthe Eugenics Education Society's peculiar use of the terms `fit' and\r\n`unfit'!) Yet it has persistently refused to give any help toward\r\nextending the knowledge of contraceptives to the exploited classes.\r\nSimilarly, though the Eugenics Review, the organ of the society,\r\nfrequently laments the `selfishness' of the refusal of maternity by\r\nhealthy and educated women of the professional classes, I have yet\r\nto learn that it has made any official pronouncement on the English\r\nillegitimacy laws or any organized effort toward defending the unmarried\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\nThis peculiarly Victorian reticence may be inherited from the founder of\r\nEugenics. Galton declared that the \"Bohemian\" element in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace is destined to perish, and \"the sooner it goes, the happier for\r\nmankind.\" The trouble with any effort of trying to divide humanity\r\ninto the \"fit\" and the \"unfit,\" is that we do not want, as H. G. Wells\r\nrecently pointed out,(5) to breed for uniformity but for variety. \"We\r\nwant statesmen and poets and musicians and philosophers and strong\r\nmen and delicate men and brave men. The qualities of one would be the\r\nweaknesses of the other.\" We want, most of all, genius.\r\n\r\nProscription on Galtonian lines would tend to eliminate many of the\r\ngreat geniuses of the world who were not only \"Bohemian,\" but actually\r\nand pathologically abnormal--men like Rousseau, Dostoevsky, Chopin, Poe,\r\nSchumann, Nietzsche, Comte, Guy de Maupassant,--and how many others?\r\nBut such considerations should not lead us into error of concluding that\r\nsuch men were geniuses merely because they were pathological specimens,\r\nand that the only way to produce a genius is to breed disease and\r\ndefect. It only emphasizes the dangers of external standards of \"fit\"\r\nand \"unfit.\"\r\n\r\nThese limitations are more strikingly shown in the types of so-called\r\n\"eugenic\" legislation passed or proposed by certain enthusiasts.\r\nRegulation, compulsion and prohibitions affected and enacted by\r\npolitical bodies are the surest methods of driving the whole problem\r\nunder-ground. As Havelock Ellis has pointed out, the absurdity and even\r\nhopelessness of effecting Eugenic improvement by placing on the statute\r\nbooks prohibitions of legal matrimony to certain classes of people,\r\nreveal the weakness of those Eugenists who minimize or undervalue the\r\nimportance of environment as a determining factor. They affirm that\r\nheredity is everything and environment nothing, yet forget that it is\r\nprecisely those who are most universally subject to bad environment who\r\nprocreate most copiously, most recklessly and most disastrously. Such\r\nmarriage laws are based for the most part on the infantile assumption\r\nthat procreation is absolutely dependent upon the marriage ceremony,\r\nan assumption usually coupled with the complementary one that the only\r\npurpose in marriage is procreation. Yet it is a fact so obvious that it\r\nis hardly worth stating that the most fertile classes who indulge in the\r\nmost dysgenic type of procreating--the feeble-minded--are almost totally\r\nunaffected by marriage laws and marriage-ceremonies.\r\n\r\nAs for the sterilization of habitual criminals, not merely must we\r\nknow more of heredity and genetics in general, but also acquire\r\nmore certainty of the justice of our laws and the honesty of their\r\nadministration before we can make rulings of fitness or unfitness merely\r\nupon the basis of a respect for law. On this point the eminent William\r\nBateson writes:(6) \"Criminals are often feeble-minded, but as regards\r\nthose that are not, the fact that a man is for the purposes of Society\r\nclassified as a criminal, tells me little as to his value, still less\r\nas to the possible value of his offspring. It is a fault inherent in\r\ncriminal jurisprudence, based on non-biological data, that the law must\r\nneeds take the nature of the offenses rather than that of the offenders\r\nas the basis of classification. A change in the right direction has\r\nbegun, but the problem is difficult and progress will be very slow.... We\r\nall know of persons convicted, perhaps even habitually, whom the\r\nworld could ill spare. Therefore I hesitate to proscribe the criminal.\r\nProscription... is a weapon with a very nasty recoil. Might not some\r\nwith equal cogency proscribe army contractors and their accomplices,\r\nthe newspaper patriots? The crimes of the prison population are petty\r\noffenses by comparison, and the significance we attach to them is a\r\nsurvival of other days. Felonies may be great events, locally, but they\r\ndo not induce catastrophies. The proclivities of the war-makers are\r\ninfinitely more dangerous than those of the aberrant beings whom from\r\ntime to time the law may dub as criminal. Consistent and portentous\r\nselfishness, combined with dullness of imagination is probably just as\r\ntransmissible as want of self-control, though destitute of the amiable\r\nqualities not rarely associated with the genetic composition of persons\r\nof unstable mind.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection, we should note another type of \"respectable\"\r\ncriminality noted by Havelock Ellis: \"If those persons who raise the cry\r\nof `race-suicide' in face of the decline of the birth-rate really had\r\nthe knowledge and the intelligence to realize the manifold evils which\r\nthey are invoking, they would deserve to be treated as criminals.\"\r\n\r\nOur debt to the science of Eugenics is great in that it directs our\r\nattention to the biological nature of humanity. Yet there is too great\r\na tendency among the thinkers of this school, to restrict their ideas\r\nof sex to its expression as a purely procreative function. Compulsory\r\nlegislation which would make the inevitably futile attempt to prohibit\r\none of the most beneficent and necessary of human expressions, or\r\nregulate it into the channels of preconceived philosophies, would reduce\r\nus to the unpleasant days predicted by William Blake, when\r\n\r\n\"Priests in black gowns will be walking their rounds And binding with\r\nbriars our joys and desires.\"\r\n\r\nEugenics is chiefly valuable in its negative aspects. It is \"negative\r\nEugenics\" that has studied the histories of such families as the Jukeses\r\nand the Kallikaks, that has pointed out the network of imbecility and\r\nfeeble-mindedness that has been sedulously spread through all strata\r\nof society. On its so-called positive or constructive side, it fails to\r\nawaken any permanent interest. \"Constructive\" Eugenics aims to arouse\r\nthe enthusiasm or the interest of the people in the welfare of the world\r\nfifteen or twenty generations in the future. On its negative side it\r\nshows us that we are paying for and even submitting to the dictates of\r\nan ever increasing, unceasingly spawning class of human beings who never\r\nshould have been born at all--that the wealth of individuals and of\r\nstates is being diverted from the development and the progress of human\r\nexpression and civilization.\r\n\r\nWhile it is necessary to point out the importance of \"heredity\" as\r\na determining factor in human life, it is fatal to elevate it to the\r\nposition of an absolute. As with environment, the concept of heredity\r\nderives its value and its meaning only in so far as it is embodied\r\nand made concrete in generations of living organisms. Environment and\r\nheredity are not antagonistic. Our problem is not that of \"Nature vs.\r\nNurture,\" but rather of Nature x Nurture, of heredity multiplied by\r\nenvironment, if we may express it thus. The Eugenist who overlooks the\r\nimportance of environment as a determining factor in human life, is as\r\nshort-sighted as the Socialist who neglects the biological nature of\r\nman. We cannot disentangle these two forces, except in theory. To the\r\nchild in the womb, said Samuel Butler, the mother is \"environment.\" She\r\nis, of course, likewise \"heredity.\" The age-old discussion of \"Nature\r\nvs. Nurture\" has been threshed out time after time, usually fruitlessly,\r\nbecause of a failure to recognize the indivisibility of these biological\r\nfactors. The opposition or antagonism between them is an artificial and\r\nacademic one, having no basis in the living organism.\r\n\r\nThe great principle of Birth Control offers the means whereby the\r\nindividual may adapt himself to and even control the forces of\r\nenvironment and heredity. Entirely apart from its Malthusian aspect or\r\nthat of the population question, Birth Control must be recognized, as\r\nthe Neo-Malthusians pointed out long ago, not \"merely as the key of the\r\nsocial position,\" and the only possible and practical method of human\r\ngeneration, but as the very pivot of civilization. Birth Control which\r\nhas been criticized as negative and destructive, is really the greatest\r\nand most truly eugenic method, and its adoption as part of the program\r\nof Eugenics would immediately give a concrete and realistic power to\r\nthat science. As a matter of fact, Birth Control has been accepted by\r\nthe most clear thinking and far seeing of the Eugenists themselves as\r\nthe most constructive and necessary of the means to racial health.(7)\r\n\r\n     (1)  Galton.

The Catholic statement completely\r\nembodies traditional opposition to Birth Control. It affords a striking\r\ncontrast by which we may clarify and justify the ethical necessity for\r\nthis new instrument of civilization as the most effective basis for\r\npractical and scientific morality. \"The authorities at Rome have again\r\nand again declared that all positive methods of this nature are immoral\r\nand forbidden,\" states the National Council of Catholic Women. \"There\r\nis no question of the lawfulness of birth restriction through abstinence\r\nfrom the relations which result in conception. The immorality of Birth\r\nControl as it is practised and commonly understood, consists in the\r\nevils of the particular method employed. These are all contrary to the\r\nmoral law because they are unnatural, being a perversion of a natural\r\nfunction. Human faculties are used in such a way as to frustrate the\r\nnatural end for which these faculties were created. This is always\r\nintrinsically wrong--as wrong as lying and blasphemy. No supposed\r\nbeneficial consequence can make good a practice which is, in itself,\r\nimmoral....\r\n\r\n\"The evil results of the practice of Birth Control are numerous.\r\nAttention will be called here to only three. The first is the\r\ndegradation of the marital relation itself, since the husband and wife\r\nwho indulge in any form of this practice come to have a lower idea of\r\nmarried life. They cannot help coming to regard each other to a great\r\nextent as mutual instruments of sensual gratification, rather than as\r\ncooperators with the Creating in bringing children into the world. This\r\nconsideration may be subtle but it undoubtedly represents the facts.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, the deliberate restriction of the family through\r\nthese immoral practices deliberately weakens self-control and the\r\ncapacity for self-denial, and increases the love of ease and luxury. The\r\nbest indication of this is that the small family is much more prevalent\r\nin the classes that are comfortable and well-to-do than among those\r\nwhose material advantages are moderate or small. The theory of the\r\nadvocates of Birth Control is that those parents who are comfortably\r\nsituated should have a large number of children (SIC!) while the poor\r\nshould restrict their offspring to a much smaller number. This theory\r\ndoes not work, for the reason that each married couple have their own\r\nidea of what constitutes unreasonable hardship in the matter of bearing\r\nand rearing children. A large proportion of the parents who are addicted\r\nto Birth Control practices are sufficiently provided with worldly goods\r\nto be free from apprehension on the economic side; nevertheless, they\r\nhave small families because they are disinclined to undertake the other\r\nburdens involved in bringing up a more numerous family. A practice which\r\ntends to produce such exaggerated notions of what constitutes hardship,\r\nwhich leads men and women to cherish such a degree of ease, makes\r\ninevitably for inefficiency, a decline in the capacity to endure and to\r\nachieve, and for a general social decadence.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, Birth Control leads sooner or later to a decline in\r\npopulation....\" (The case of France is instanced.) But it is essentially\r\nthe moral question that alarms the Catholic women, for the statement\r\nconcludes: \"The further effect of such proposed legislation will\r\ninevitably be a lowering both of public and private morals. What the\r\nfathers of this country termed indecent and forbade the mails to carry,\r\nwill, if such legislation is carried through, be legally decent. The\r\npurveyors of sexual license and immorality will have the opportunity to\r\nsend almost anything they care to write through the mails on the plea\r\nthat it is sex information. Not only the married but also the unmarried\r\nwill be thus affected; the ideals of the young contaminated and lowered.\r\nThe morals of the entire nation will suffer.\r\n\r\n\"The proper attitude of Catholics... is clear. They should watch and\r\noppose all attempts in state legislatures and in Congress to repeal\r\nthe laws which now prohibit the dissemination of information concerning\r\nBirth Control. Such information will be spread only too rapidly despite\r\nexisting laws. To repeal these would greatly accelerate this deplorable\r\nmovement.(1)\"\r\n\r\nThe Catholic position has been stated in an even more extreme form\r\nby Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes of the archdiocese of New York. In a\r\n\"Christmas Pastoral\" this dignitary even went to the extent of declaring\r\nthat \"even though some little angels in the flesh, through the physical\r\nor mental deformities of their parents, may appear to human eyes\r\nhideous, misshapen, a blot on civilized society, we must not lose\r\nsight of this Christian thought that under and within such visible\r\nmalformation, lives an immortal soul to be saved and glorified for all\r\neternity among the blessed in heaven.\"(2)\r\n\r\nWith the type of moral philosophy expressed in this utterance, we\r\nneed not argue. It is based upon traditional ideas that have had the\r\npractical effect of making this world a vale of tears. Fortunately such\r\nwords carry no weight with those who can bring free and keen as well as\r\nnoble minds to the consideration of the matter. To them the idealism of\r\nsuch an utterance appears crude and cruel. The menace to civilization of\r\nsuch orthodoxy, if it be orthodoxy, lies in the fact that its powerful\r\nexponents may be for a time successful not merely in influencing\r\nthe conduct of their adherents but in checking freedom of thought and\r\ndiscussion. To this, with all the vehemence of emphasis at our command,\r\nwe object. From what Archbishop Hayes believes concerning the future\r\nblessedness in Heaven of the souls of those who are born into this world\r\nas hideous and misshapen beings he has a right to seek such consolation\r\nas may be obtained; but we who are trying to better the conditions of\r\nthis world believe that a healthy, happy human race is more in keeping\r\nwith the laws of God, than disease, misery and poverty perpetuating\r\nitself generation after generation. Furthermore, while conceding to\r\nCatholic or other churchmen full freedom to preach their own doctrines,\r\nwhether of theology or morals, nevertheless when they attempt to carry\r\nthese ideas into legislative acts and force their opinions and codes\r\nupon the non-Catholics, we consider such action an interference with the\r\nprinciples of democracy and we have a right to protest.\r\n\r\nReligious propaganda against Birth Control is crammed with contradiction\r\nand fallacy. It refutes itself. Yet it brings the opposing views into\r\nvivid contrast. In stating these differences we should make clear\r\nthat advocates of Birth Control are not seeking to attack the Catholic\r\nchurch. We quarrel with that church, however, when it seeks to assume\r\nauthority over non-Catholics and to dub their behavior immoral because\r\nthey do not conform to the dictatorship of Rome. The question of bearing\r\nand rearing children we hold is the concern of the mother and the\r\npotential mother. If she delegates the responsibility, the ethical\r\neducation, to an external authority, that is her affair. We object,\r\nhowever, to the State or the Church which appoints itself as arbiter\r\nand dictator in this sphere and attempts to force unwilling women into\r\ncompulsory maternity.\r\n\r\nWhen Catholics declare that \"The authorities at Rome have again and\r\nagain declared that all positive methods of this nature are immoral and\r\nforbidden,\" they do so upon the assumption that morality consists in\r\nconforming to laws laid down and enforced by external authority, in\r\nsubmission to decrees and dicta imposed from without. In this case, they\r\ndecide in a wholesale manner the conduct of millions, demanding of\r\nthem not the intelligent exercise of their own individual judgment and\r\ndiscrimination, but unquestioning submission and conformity to dogma.\r\nThe Church thus takes the place of all-powerful parents, and demands\r\nof its children merely that they should obey. In my belief such a\r\nphilosophy hampers the development of individual intelligence. Morality\r\nthen becomes a more or less successful attempt to conform to a code,\r\ninstead of an attempt to bring reason and intelligence to bear upon the\r\nsolution of each individual human problem.\r\n\r\nBut, we read on, Birth Control methods are not merely contrary to \"moral\r\nlaw,\" but forbidden because they are \"unnatural,\" being \"the perversion\r\nof a natural function.\" This, of course, is the weakest link in the\r\nwhole chain. Yet \"there is no question of the lawfulness of birth\r\nrestriction through abstinence\"--as though abstinence itself were not\r\nunnatural! For more than a thousand years the Church was occupied with\r\nthe problem of imposing abstinence on its priesthood, its most educated\r\nand trained body of men, educated to look upon asceticism as the finest\r\nideal; it took one thousand years to convince the Catholic priesthood\r\nthat abstinence was \"natural\" or practicable.(3) Nevertheless, there is\r\nstill this talk of abstinence, self-control, and self-denial, almost in\r\nthe same breath with the condemnation of Birth Control as \"unnatural.\"\r\n\r\nIf it is our duty to act as \"cooperators with the Creator\" to bring\r\nchildren into the world, it is difficult to say at what point our\r\nbehavior is \"unnatural.\" If it is immoral and \"unnatural\" to prevent\r\nan unwanted life from coming into existence, is it not immoral and\r\n\"unnatural\" to remain unmarried from the age of puberty? Such casuistry\r\nis unconvincing and feeble. We need only point out that rational\r\nintelligence is also a \"natural\" function, and that it is as imperative\r\nfor us to use the faculties of judgment, criticism, discrimination of\r\nchoice, selection and control, all the faculties of the intelligence,\r\nas it is to use those of reproduction. It is certainly dangerous \"to\r\nfrustrate the natural ends for which these faculties were created.\"\r\nThis also, is always intrinsically wrong--as wrong as lying and\r\nblasphemy--and infinitely more devastating. Intelligence is as natural\r\nto us as any other faculty, and it is fatal to moral development and\r\ngrowth to refuse to use it and to delegate to others the solution of\r\nour individual problems. The evil will not be that one's conduct is\r\ndivergent from current and conventional moral codes. There may be every\r\noutward evidence of conformity, but this agreement may be arrived at, by\r\nthe restriction and suppression of subjective desires, and the more\r\nor less successful attempt at mere conformity. Such \"morality\" would\r\nconceal an inner conflict. The fruits of this conflict would be neurosis\r\nand hysteria on the one hand; or concealed gratification of suppressed\r\ndesires on the other, with a resultant hypocrisy and cant. True morality\r\ncannot be based on conformity. There must be no conflict between\r\nsubjective desire and outward behavior.\r\n\r\nTo object to these traditional and churchly ideas does not by any means\r\nimply that the doctrine of Birth Control is anti-Christian. On the\r\ncontrary, it may be profoundly in accordance with the Sermon on the\r\nMount. One of the greatest living theologians and most penetrating\r\nstudents of the problems of civilization is of this opinion. In an\r\naddress delivered before the Eugenics Education Society of London,(4)\r\nWilliam Ralph Inge, the Very Reverend Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral,\r\nLondon, pointed out that the doctrine of Birth Control was to be\r\ninterpreted as of the very essence of Christianity.\r\n\r\n\"We should be ready to give up all our theories,\" he asserted, \"if\r\nscience proved that we were on the wrong lines. And we can understand,\r\nthough we profoundly disagree with, those who oppose us on the grounds\r\nof authority.... We know where we are with a man who says, `Birth Control\r\nis forbidden by God; we prefer poverty, unemployment, war, the physical,\r\nintellectual and moral degeneration of the people, and a high death rate,\r\nto any interference with the universal command to be fruitful and\r\nmultiply'; but we have no patience with those who say that we can have\r\nunrestricted and unregulated propagation without those consequences.\r\nIt is a great part of our work to press home to the public mind the\r\nalternative that lies before us. Either rational selection must take the\r\nplace of the natural selection which the modern State will not allow to\r\nact, or we must go on deteriorating. When we can convince the public of\r\nthis, the opposition of organized religion will soon collapse or become\r\nineffective.\" Dean Inge effectively answers those who have objected\r\nto the methods of Birth Control as \"immoral\" and in contradiction and\r\ninimical to the teachings of Christ. Incidentally he claims that those\r\nwho are not blinded by prejudices recognize that \"Christianity aims at\r\nsaving the soul--the personality, the nature, of man, not his body or\r\nhis environment. According to Christianity, a man is saved, not by\r\nwhat he has, or knows, or does, but by what he is. It treats all the\r\napparatus of life with a disdain as great as that of the biologist; so\r\nlong as a man is inwardly healthy, it cares very little whether he\r\nis rich or poor, learned or simple, and even whether he is happy, or\r\nunhappy. It attaches no importance to quantitative measurements of any\r\nkind. The Christian does not gloat over favorable trade-statistics, nor\r\ncongratulate himself on the disparity between the number of births and\r\ndeaths. For him... the test of the welfare of a country is the quality\r\nof human beings whom it produces. Quality is everything, quantity is\r\nnothing. And besides this, the Christian conception of a kingdom of God\r\nupon the earth teaches us to turn our eyes to the future, and to think\r\nof the welfare of posterity as a thing which concerns us as much as that\r\nof our own generation. This welfare, as conceived by Christianity, is\r\nof course something different from external prosperity; it is to be the\r\nvictory of intrinsic worth and healthiness over all the false ideals and\r\ndeep-seated diseases which at present spoil civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not political religion with which I am concerned,\" Dean Inge\r\nexplained, \"but the convictions of really religious persons; and I do\r\nnot think that we need despair of converting them to our views.\"\r\n\r\nDean Inge believes Birth Control is an essential part of Eugenics, and\r\nan essential part of Christian morality. On this point he asserts: \"We\r\ndo wish to remind our orthodox and conservative friends that the Sermon\r\non the Mount contains some admirably clear and unmistakable eugenic\r\nprecepts. `Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? A\r\ncorrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit, neither can a good tree\r\nbring forth evil fruit. Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit\r\nis hewn down, and cast into the fire.' We wish to apply these words not\r\nonly to the actions of individuals, which spring from their characters,\r\nbut to the character of individuals, which spring from their inherited\r\nqualities. This extension of the scope of the maxim seems to me quite\r\nlegitimate. Men do not gather grapes of thorns. As our proverb says, you\r\ncannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. If we believe this, and do\r\nnot act upon it by trying to move public opinion towards giving social\r\nreform, education and religion a better material to work upon, we\r\nare sinning against the light, and not doing our best to bring in the\r\nKingdom of God upon earth.\"\r\n\r\nAs long as sexual activity is regarded in a dualistic and contradictory\r\nlight,--in which it is revealed either as the instrument by which men\r\nand women \"cooperate with the Creator\" to bring children into the\r\nworld, on the one hand; and on the other, as the sinful instrument of\r\nself-gratification, lust and sensuality, there is bound to be an endless\r\nconflict in human conduct, producing ever increasing misery, pain and\r\ninjustice. In crystallizing and codifying this contradiction, the Church\r\nnot only solidified its own power over men but reduced women to the most\r\nabject and prostrate slavery. It was essentially a morality that would\r\nnot \"work.\" The sex instinct in the human race is too strong to be bound\r\nby the dictates of any church. The church's failure, its century after\r\ncentury of failure, is now evident on every side: for, having convinced\r\nmen and women that only in its baldly propagative phase is sexual\r\nexpression legitimate, the teachings of the Church have driven sex\r\nunder-ground, into secret channels, strengthened the conspiracy of\r\nsilence, concentrated men's thoughts upon the \"lusts of the body,\" have\r\nsown, cultivated and reaped a crop of bodily and mental diseases, and\r\ndeveloped a society congenitally and almost hopelessly unbalanced. How\r\nis any progress to be made, how is any human expression or education\r\npossible when women and men are taught to combat and resist their\r\nnatural impulses and to despise their bodily functions?\r\n\r\nHumanity, we are glad to realize, is rapidly freeing itself from this\r\n\"morality\" imposed upon it by its self-appointed and self-perpetuating\r\nmasters. From a hundred different points the imposing edifice of this\r\n\"morality\" has been and is being attacked. Sincere and thoughtful\r\ndefenders and exponents of the teachings of Christ now acknowledge the\r\nfalsity of the traditional codes and their malignant influence upon the\r\nmoral and physical well-being of humanity.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical opposition to Birth Control on the part of certain\r\nrepresentatives of the Protestant churches, based usually on quotations\r\nfrom the Bible, is equally invalid, and for the same reason. The\r\nattitude of the more intelligent and enlightened clergy has been well\r\nand succinctly expressed by Dean Inge, who, referring to the ethics of\r\nBirth Control, writes: \"THIS IS EMPHATICALLY A MATTER IN WHICH EVERY\r\nMAN AND WOMAN MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES, AND MUST REFRAIN FROM JUDGING\r\nOTHERS.\" We must not neglect the important fact that it is not merely\r\nin the practical results of such a decision, not in the small number of\r\nchildren, not even in the healthier and better cared for children, not\r\nin the possibility of elevating the living conditions of the individual\r\nfamily, that the ethical value of Birth Control alone lies. Precisely\r\nbecause the practice of Birth Control does demand the exercise of\r\ndecision, the making of choice, the use of the reasoning powers, is\r\nit an instrument of moral education as well as of hygienic and racial\r\nadvance. It awakens the attention of parents to their potential\r\nchildren. It forces upon the individual consciousness the question of\r\nthe standards of living. In a profound manner it protects and reasserts\r\nthe inalienable rights of the child-to-be.\r\n\r\nPsychology and the outlook of modern life are stressing the growth\r\nof independent responsibility and discrimination as the true basis of\r\nethics. The old traditional morality, with its train of vice, disease,\r\npromiscuity and prostitution, is in reality dying out, killing itself\r\noff because it is too irresponsible and too dangerous to individual\r\nand social well-being. The transition from the old to the new, like\r\nall fundamental changes, is fraught with many dangers. But it is a\r\nrevolution that cannot be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe smaller family, with its lower infant mortality rate, is, in more\r\ndefinite and concrete manner than many actions outwardly deemed \"moral,\"\r\nthe expression of moral judgment and responsibility. It is the assertion\r\nof a standard of living, inspired by the wish to obtain a fuller and\r\nmore expressive life for the children than the parents have enjoyed. If\r\nthe morality or immorality of any course of conduct is to be determined\r\nby the motives which inspire it, there is evidently at the present day\r\nno higher morality than the intelligent practice of Birth Control.\r\n\r\nThe immorality of many who practise Birth Control lies in not daring to\r\npreach what they practise. What is the secret of the hypocrisy of the\r\nwell-to-do, who are willing to contribute generously to charities\r\nand philanthropies, who spend thousands annually in the upkeep and\r\nsustenance of the delinquent, the defective and the dependent; and yet\r\njoin the conspiracy of silence that prevents the poorer classes from\r\nlearning how to improve their conditions, and elevate their standards\r\nof living? It is as though they were to cry: \"We'll give you anything\r\nexcept the thing you ask for--the means whereby you may become\r\nresponsible and self-reliant in your own lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe brunt of this injustice falls on women, because the old traditional\r\nmorality is the invention of men. \"No religion, no physical or moral\r\ncode,\" wrote the clear-sighted George Drysdale, \"proposed by one sex\r\nfor the other, can be really suitable. Each must work out its laws for\r\nitself in every department of life.\" In the moral code developed by the\r\nChurch, women have been so degraded that they have been habituated to\r\nlook upon themselves through the eyes of men. Very imperfectly have\r\nwomen developed their own self-consciousness, the realization of their\r\ntremendous and supreme position in civilization. Women can develop\r\nthis power only in one way; by the exercise of responsibility, by the\r\nexercise of judgment, reason or discrimination. They need ask for\r\nno \"rights.\" They need only assert power. Only by the exercise of\r\nself-guidance and intelligent self-direction can that inalienable,\r\nsupreme, pivotal power be expressed. More than ever in history\r\nwomen need to realize that nothing can ever come to us from another.\r\nEverything we attain we must owe to ourselves. Our own spirit must\r\nvitalize it. Our own heart must feel it. For we are not passive\r\nmachines. We are not to be lectured, guided and molded this way or that.\r\nWe are alive and intelligent, we women, no less than men, and we must\r\nawaken to the essential realization that we are living beings, endowed\r\nwith will, choice, comprehension, and that every step in life must be\r\ntaken at our own initiative.\r\n\r\nMoral and sexual balance in civilization will only be established by the\r\nassertion and expression of power on the part of women. This power will\r\nnot be found in any futile seeking for economic independence or in the\r\naping of men in industrial and business pursuits, nor by joining battle\r\nfor the so-called \"single standard.\" Woman's power can only be expressed\r\nand make itself felt when she refuses the task of bringing unwanted\r\nchildren into the world to be exploited in industry and slaughtered in\r\nwars. When we refuse to produce battalions of babies to be exploited;\r\nwhen we declare to the nation; \"Show us that the best possible chance in\r\nlife is given to every child now brought into the world, before you cry\r\nfor more! At present our children are a glut on the market. You hold\r\ninfant life cheap. Help us to make the world a fit place for children.\r\nWhen you have done this, we will bear you children,--then we shall be\r\ntrue women.\" The new morality will express this power and responsibility\r\non the part of women.\r\n\r\n\"With the realization of the moral responsibility of women,\" writes\r\nHavelock Ellis, \"the natural relations of life spring back to their due\r\nbiological adjustment. Motherhood is restored to its natural sacredness.\r\nIt becomes the concern of the woman herself, and not of society nor any\r\nindividual, to determine the conditions under which the child shall be\r\nconceived....\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, woman shall further assert her power by refusing to remain\r\nthe passive instrument of sensual self-gratification on the part of\r\nmen. Birth Control, in philosophy and practice, is the destroyer of\r\nthat dualism of the old sexual code. It denies that the sole purpose\r\nof sexual activity is procreation; it also denies that sex should\r\nbe reduced to the level of sensual lust, or that woman should permit\r\nherself to be the instrument of its satisfaction. In increasing and\r\ndifferentiating her love demands, woman must elevate sex into another\r\nsphere, whereby it may subserve and enhance the possibility of\r\nindividual and human expression. Man will gain in this no less than\r\nwoman; for in the age-old enslavement of woman he has enslaved himself;\r\nand in the liberation of womankind, all of humanity will experience the\r\njoys of a new and fuller freedom.\r\n\r\nOn this great fundamental and pivotal point new light has been thrown\r\nby Lord Bertrand Dawson, the physician of the King of England. In the\r\nremarkable and epoch-making address at the Birmingham Church Congress\r\n(referred to in my introduction), he spoke of the supreme morality of\r\nthe mutual and reciprocal joy in the most intimate relation between man\r\nand woman. Without this reciprocity there can be no civilization worthy\r\nof the name. Lord Dawson suggested that there should be added to the\r\nclauses of marriage in the Prayer Book \"the complete realization of the\r\nlove of this man and this woman one for another,\" and in support of his\r\ncontention declared that sex love between husband and wife--apart from\r\nparenthood--was something to prize and cherish for its own sake. The\r\nLambeth Conference, he remarked, \"envisaged a love invertebrate and\r\njoyless,\" whereas, in his view, natural passion in wedlock was not a\r\nthing to be ashamed of or unduly repressed. The pronouncement of\r\nthe Church of England, as set forth in Resolution 68 of the Lambeth\r\nConference seems to imply condemnation of sex love as such, and to imply\r\nsanction of sex love only as a means to an end,--namely, procreation.\r\nThe Lambeth Resolution stated:\r\n\r\n\"In opposition to the teaching which under the name of science and\r\nreligion encourages married people in the deliberate cultivation of\r\nsexual union as an end in itself, we steadfastly uphold what must always\r\nbe regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage.\r\nOne is the primary purpose for which marriage exists--namely, the\r\ncontinuation of the race through the gift and heritage of children;\r\nthe other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and\r\nthoughtful self-control.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this point of view Lord Dawson asserted:\r\n\r\n\"Sex love has, apart from parenthood, a purport of its own. It is\r\nsomething to prize and to cherish for its own sake. It is an essential\r\npart of health and happiness in marriage. And now, if you will allow me,\r\nI will carry this argument a step further. If sexual union is a gift of\r\nGod it is worth learning how to use it. Within its own sphere it should\r\nbe cultivated so as to bring physical satisfaction to both, not merely\r\nto one.... The real problems before us are those of sex love and child\r\nlove; and by sex love I mean that love which involves intercourse or the\r\ndesire for such. It is necessary to my argument to emphasize that sex\r\nlove is one of the dominating forces of the world. Not only does history\r\nshow the destinies of nations and dynasties determined by its sway--but\r\nhere in our every-day life we see its influence, direct or indirect,\r\nforceful and ubiquitous beyond aught else. Any statesmanlike view,\r\ntherefore, will recognize that here we have an instinct so fundamental,\r\nso imperious, that its influence is a fact which has to be accepted;\r\nsuppress it you cannot. You may guide it into healthy channels, but\r\nan outlet it will have, and if that outlet is inadequate and unduly\r\nobstructed irregular channels will be forced....\r\n\r\n\"The attainment of mutual and reciprocal joy in their relations\r\nconstitutes a firm bond between two people, and makes for durability of\r\nthe marriage tie. Reciprocity in sex love is the physical counterpart of\r\nsympathy. More marriages fail from inadequate and clumsy sex love than\r\nfrom too much sex love. The lack of proper understanding is in no small\r\nmeasure responsible for the unfulfillment of connubial happiness, and\r\nevery degree of discontent and unhappiness may, from this cause, occur,\r\nleading to rupture of the marriage bond itself. How often do medical\r\nmen have to deal with these difficulties, and how fortunate if such\r\ndifficulties are disclosed early enough in married life to be rectified.\r\nOtherwise how tragic may be their consequences, and many a case in the\r\nDivorce Court has thus had its origin. To the foregoing contentions,\r\nit might be objected, you are encouraging passion. My reply would be,\r\npassion is a worthy possession--most men, who are any good, are\r\ncapable of passion. You all enjoy ardent and passionate love in art and\r\nliterature. Why not give it a place in real life? Why some people look\r\naskance at passion is because they are confusing it with sensuality. Sex\r\nlove without passion is a poor, lifeless thing. Sensuality, on the other\r\nhand, is on a level with gluttony--a physical excess--detached from\r\nsentiment, chivalry, or tenderness. It is just as important to give sex\r\nlove its place as to avoid its over-emphasis. Its real and effective\r\nrestraints are those imposed by a loving and sympathetic companionship,\r\nby the privileges of parenthood, the exacting claims of career and\r\nthat civic sense which prompts men to do social service. Now that the\r\nrevision of the Prayer Book is receiving consideration, I should like to\r\nsuggest with great respect an addition made to the objects of marriage\r\nin the Marriage Service, in these terms, 'The complete realization of\r\nthe love of this man and this woman, the one for the other.'\"\r\n\r\nTurning to the specific problem of Birth Control, Lord Dawson declared,\r\n\"that Birth Control is here to stay. It is an established fact, and for\r\ngood or evil has to be accepted. Although the extent of its application\r\ncan be and is being modified, no denunciations will abolish it. Despite\r\nthe influence and condemnations of the Church, it has been practised\r\nin France for well over half a century, and in Belgium and other Roman\r\nCatholic countries is extending. And if the Roman Catholic Church, with\r\nits compact organization, its power of authority, and its disciplines,\r\ncannot check this procedure, it is not likely that Protestant Churches\r\nwill be able to do so, for Protestant religions depend for their\r\nstrength on the conviction and esteem they establish in the heads and\r\nhearts of their people. The reasons which lead parents to limit their\r\noffspring are sometimes selfish, but more often honorable and cogent.\"\r\n\r\nA report of the Fabian Society (5) on the morality of Birth Control,\r\nbased upon a census conducted under the chairmanship of Sidney Webb,\r\nconcludes: \"These facts--which we are bound to face whether we like them\r\nor not--will appear in different lights to different people. In\r\nsome quarters it seems to be sufficient to dismiss them with moral\r\nindignation, real or simulated. Such a judgment appears both irrelevant\r\nand futile.... If a course of conduct is habitually and deliberately\r\npursued by vast multitudes of otherwise well-conducted people, forming\r\nprobably a majority of the whole educated class of the nation, we must\r\nassume that it does not conflict with their actual code of morality.\r\nThey may be intellectually mistaken, but they are not doing what they\r\nfeel to be wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe moral justification and ethical necessity of Birth Control need not\r\nbe empirically based upon the mere approval of experience and custom.\r\nIts morality is more profound. Birth Control is an ethical necessity\r\nfor humanity to-day because it places in our hands a new instrument of\r\nself-expression and self-realization. It gives us control over one of\r\nthe primordial forces of nature, to which in the past the majority\r\nof mankind have been enslaved, and by which it has been cheapened and\r\ndebased. It arouses us to the possibility of newer and greater freedom.\r\nIt develops the power, the responsibility and intelligence to use this\r\nfreedom in living a liberated and abundant life. It permits us to enjoy\r\nthis liberty without danger of infringing upon the similar liberty of\r\nour fellow men, or of injuring and curtailing the freedom of the next\r\ngeneration. It shows us that we need not seek in the amassing of worldly\r\nwealth, not in the illusion of some extra-terrestrial Heaven or earthly\r\nUtopia of a remote future the road to human development. The Kingdom of\r\nHeaven is in a very definite sense within us. Not by leaving our body\r\nand our fundamental humanity behind us, not by aiming to be anything but\r\nwhat we are, shall we become ennobled or immortal. By knowing ourselves,\r\nby expressing ourselves, by realizing ourselves more completely than\r\nhas ever before been possible, not only shall we attain the kingdom\r\nourselves but we shall hand on the torch of life undimmed to our\r\nchildren and the children of our children.\r\n\r\n     (1)  Quoted in the National Catholic Welfare Council\r\n     Bulletin: Vol. II, No. 5, p. 21 (January, 1921).\r\n\r\n     (2)  Quoted in daily press, December 19, 1921.\r\n\r\n     (3)  H.

Ignorance, poverty, and vice\r\n     must stop populating the world.  This cannot be done by\r\n     moral suasion.  This cannot be done by talk or example.\r\n     This cannot be done by religion or by law, by priest\r\n     or by hangman.  This cannot be done by force, physical\r\n     or moral.  To accomplish this there is but one way.\r\n     Science must make woman the owner, the mistress of herself.\r\n     Science, the only possible savior of mankind, must put it\r\n     in the power of woman to decide for herself whether she will\r\n     or will not become a mother.\"\r\n\r\n     Robert G. Ingersoll\r\n\r\n\"Science is the great instrument of social change,\" wrote A. J.\r\nBalfour in 1908; \"all the greater because its object is not change but\r\nknowledge, and its silent appropriation of this dominant function, amid\r\nthe din of religious and political strife, is the most vital of all\r\nrevolutions which have marked the development of modern civilization.\"\r\nThe Birth Control movement has allied itself with science, and no small\r\npart of its present propaganda is to awaken the interest of scientists\r\nto the pivotal importance to civilization of this instrument. Only with\r\nthe aid of science is it possible to perfect a practical method that\r\nmay be universally taught. As Dean Inge recently admitted: \"We should be\r\nready to give up all our theories if science proved that we were on the\r\nwrong lines.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the principal aims of the American Birth Control League has been\r\nto awaken the interest of scientific investigators and to point out\r\nthe rich field for original research opened up by this problem. The\r\ncorrelation of reckless breeding with defective and delinquent strains,\r\nhas not, strangely enough, been subjected to close scientific scrutiny,\r\nnor has the present biological unbalance been traced to its root. This\r\nis a crying necessity of our day, and it cannot be accomplished without\r\nthe aid of science.\r\n\r\nSecondary only to the response of women themselves is the awakened\r\ninterest of scientists, statisticians, and research workers in every\r\nfield. If the clergy and the defenders of traditional morality have\r\nopposed the movement for Birth Control, the response of enlightened\r\nscientists and physicians has been one of the most encouraging aids in\r\nour battle.\r\n\r\nRecent developments in the realm of science,--in psychology, in\r\nphysiology, in chemistry and physics--all tend to emphasize the\r\nimmediate necessity for human control over the great forces of nature.\r\nThe new ideas published by contemporary science are of the utmost\r\nfascination and illumination even to the layman. They perform the\r\ninvaluable task of making us look at life in a new light, of searching\r\nclose at hand for the solution to heretofore closed mysteries of life.\r\nIn this brief chapter, I can touch these ideas only as they have proved\r\nvaluable to me. Professor Soddy's \"Science and Life\" is one of the most\r\ninspiring of recent publications in this field; for this great authority\r\nshows us how closely bound up is science with the whole of Society, how\r\nscience must help to solve the great and disastrous unbalance in human\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAs an example: a whole literature has sprung into being around the\r\nglands, the most striking being \"The Sex Complex\" by Blair Bell. This\r\nauthor advances the idea of the glandular system as an integral whole,\r\nthe glands forming a unity which might be termed the generative system.\r\nThus is reasserted the radical importance of sexual health to every\r\nindividual. The whole tendency of modern physiology and psychology, in a\r\nword, seems gradually coming to the truth that seemed intuitively to be\r\nrevealed to that great woman, Olive Schreiner, who, in \"Woman and Labor\"\r\nwrote: \"... Noble is the function of physical reproduction of humanity by\r\nthe union of man and woman. Rightly viewed, that union has in it latent,\r\nother and even higher forms of creative energy and life-dispensing\r\npower, and... its history on earth has only begun; as the first wild rose\r\nwhen it hung from its stem with its center of stamens and pistils and\r\nits single whorl of pale petals had only begun its course, and was\r\ndestined, as the ages passed, to develop stamen upon stamen and petal\r\nupon petal, till it assumed a hundred forms of joy and beauty.\r\n\r\n\"And it would indeed almost seem, that, on the path toward the higher\r\ndevelopment of sexual life on earth, as man has so often had to lead\r\nin other paths, that here it is perhaps woman, by reason of those very\r\nsexual conditions which in the past have crushed and trammeled her, who\r\nis bound to lead the way and man to follow. So that it may be at last\r\nthat sexual love--that tired angel who through the ages has presided\r\nover the march of humanity, with distraught eyes, and feather-shafts\r\nbroken and wings drabbled in the mires of lust and greed, and golden\r\nlocks caked over with the dust of injustice and oppression--till those\r\nlooking at him have sometimes cried in terror, `He is the Evil and\r\nnot the Good of life': and have sought if it were not possible, to\r\nexterminate him--shall yet, at last, bathed from the mire and dust of\r\nages in the streams of friendship and freedom, leap upwards, with white\r\nwings spread, resplendent in the sunshine of a distant future--the\r\nessentially Good and Beautiful of human existence.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day science is verifying the truth of this inspiring vision. Certain\r\nfundamental truths concerning the basic facts of Nature and humanity\r\nespecially impress us. A rapid survey may indicate the main features of\r\nthis mysterious identity and antagonism.\r\n\r\nMankind has gone forward by the capture and control of the forces of\r\nNature. This upward struggle began with the kindling of the first fire.\r\nThe domestication of animal life marked another great step in the long\r\nascent. The capture of the great physical forces, the discovery of coal\r\nand mineral oil, of gas, steam and electricity, and their adaptation to\r\nthe everyday uses of mankind, wrought the greatest changes in the course\r\nof civilization. With the discovery of radium and radioactivity, with\r\nthe recognition of the vast stores of physical energy concealed in the\r\natom, humanity is now on the eve of a new conquest. But, on the other\r\nside, humanity has been compelled to combat continuously those great\r\nforces of Nature which have opposed it at every moment of this long\r\nindomitable march out of barbarism. Humanity has had to wage war against\r\ninsects, germs, bacteria, which have spread disease and epidemics and\r\ndevastation. Humanity has had to adapt itself to those natural forces\r\nit could not conquer but could only adroitly turn to its own ends.\r\nNevertheless, all along the line, in colonization, in agriculture, in\r\nmedicine and in industry, mankind has triumphed over Nature.\r\n\r\nBut lest the recognition of this victory lead us to self-satisfaction\r\nand complacency, we should never forget that this mastery consists to\r\na great extent in a recognition of the power of those blind forces, and\r\nour adroit control over them. It has been truly said that we attain\r\nno power over Nature until we learn natural laws and conform and adapt\r\nourselves to them.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the human race has been its ability not merely to\r\nsubjugate the forces of Nature, but to adapt itself to those it could\r\nnot conquer. And even this subjugation, science tells us, has not\r\nresulted from any attempt to suppress, prohibit, or eradicate these\r\nforces, but rather to transform blind and undirected energies to our own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThese great natural forces, science now asserts, are not all external.\r\nThey are surely concealed within the complex organism of the human being\r\nno less than outside of it. These inner forces are no less imperative,\r\nno less driving and compelling than the external forces of Nature. As\r\nthe old conception of the antagonism between body and soul is broken\r\ndown, as psychology becomes an ally of physiology and biology, and\r\nbiology joins hands with physics and chemistry, we are taught to see\r\nthat there is a mysterious unity between these inner and outer forces.\r\nThey express themselves in accordance with the same structural, physical\r\nand chemical laws. The development of civilization in the subjective\r\nworld, in the sphere of behavior, conduct and morality, has been\r\nprecisely the gradual accumulation and popularization of methods which\r\nteach people how to direct, transform and transmute the driving power of\r\nthe great natural forces.\r\n\r\nPsychology is now recognizing the forces concealed in the human\r\norganism. In the long process of adaptation to social life, men have\r\nhad to harness the wishes and desires born of these inner energies,\r\nthe greatest and most imperative of which are Sex and Hunger. From\r\nthe beginning of time, men have been driven by Hunger into a thousand\r\nactivities. It is Hunger that has created \"the struggle for existence.\"\r\nHunger has spurred men to the discovery and invention of methods and\r\nways of avoiding starvation, of storing and exchanging foods. It has\r\ndeveloped primitive barter into our contemporary Wall Streets. It has\r\ndeveloped thrift and economy,--expedients whereby humanity avoids the\r\nlash of King Hunger. The true \"economic interpretation of history\" might\r\nbe termed the History of Hunger.\r\n\r\nBut no less fundamental, no less imperative, no less ceaseless in its\r\ndynamic energy, has been the great force of Sex. We do not yet know the\r\nintricate but certainly organic relationship between these two forces.\r\nIt is obvious that they oppose yet reinforce each other,--driving,\r\nlashing, spurring mankind on to new conquests or to certain ruin.\r\nPerhaps Hunger and Sex are merely opposite poles of a single great\r\nlife force. In the past we have made the mistake of separating them\r\nand attempting to study one of them without the other. Birth Control\r\nemphasizes the need of re-investigation and of knowledge of their\r\nintegral relationship, and aims at the solution of the great problem of\r\nHunger and Sex at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nIn the more recent past the effort has been made to control, civilize,\r\nand sublimate the great primordial natural force of sex, mainly by\r\nfutile efforts at prohibition, suppression, restraint, and extirpation.\r\nIts revenge, as the psychoanalysts are showing us every day, has been\r\ngreat. Insanity, hysteria, neuroses, morbid fears and compulsions,\r\nweaken and render useless and unhappy thousands of humans who are\r\nunconscious victims of the attempt to pit individual powers against this\r\ngreat natural force. In the solution of the problem of sex, we should\r\nbear in mind what the successful method of humanity has been in its\r\nconquest, or rather its control of the great physical and chemical\r\nforces of the external world. Like all other energy, that of sex is\r\nindestructible. By adaptation, control and conscious direction, we may\r\ntransmute and sublimate it. Without irreparable injury to ourselves we\r\ncannot attempt to eradicate it or extirpate it.\r\n\r\nThe study of atomic energy, the discovery of radioactivity, and the\r\nrecognition of potential and latent energies stored in inanimate matter,\r\nthrow a brilliant illumination upon the whole problem of sex and\r\nthe inner energies of mankind. Speaking of the discovery of radium,\r\nProfessor Soddy writes: \"Tracked to earth the clew to a great secret\r\nfor which a thousand telescopes might have swept the sky forever and\r\nin vain, lay in a scrap of matter, dowered with something of the same\r\ninexhaustible radiance that hitherto has been the sole prerogative of\r\nthe distant stars and sun.\" Radium, this distinguished authority tells\r\nus, has clothed with its own dignity the whole empire of common matter.\r\n\r\nMuch as the atomic theory, with its revelations of the vast treasure\r\nhouse of radiant energy that lies all about us, offers new hope in the\r\nmaterial world, so the new psychology throws a new light upon human\r\nenergies and possibilities of individual expression. Social reformers,\r\nlike those scientists of a bygone era who were sweeping the skies\r\nwith their telescopes, have likewise been seeking far and wide for\r\nthe solution of our social problems in remote and wholesale panaceas,\r\nwhereas the true solution is close at hand,--in the human individual.\r\nBuried within each human being lies concealed a vast store of energy,\r\nwhich awaits release, expression and sublimation. The individual may\r\nprofitably be considered as the \"atom\" of society. And the solution of\r\nthe problems of society and of civilization will be brought about when\r\nwe release the energies now latent and undeveloped in the individual.\r\nProfessor Edwin Grant Conklin expresses the problem in another form;\r\nthough his analogy, it seems to me, is open to serious criticism. \"The\r\nfreedom of the individual man,\" he writes,(1) \"is to that of society as\r\nthe freedom of the single cell is to that of the human being. It is this\r\nlarge freedom of society, rather than the freedom of the individual,\r\nwhich democracy offers to the world, free societies, free states, free\r\nnations rather than absolutely free individuals. In all organisms and in\r\nall social organizations, the freedom of the minor units must be limited\r\nin order that the larger unit may achieve a new and greater freedom, and\r\nin social evolution the freedom of individuals must be merged more and\r\nmore into the larger freedom of society.\"\r\n\r\nThis analogy does not bear analysis. Restraint and constraint of\r\nindividual expression, suppression of individual freedom \"for the good\r\nof society\" has been practised from time immemorial; and its failure\r\nis all too evident. There is no antagonism between the good of the\r\nindividual and the good of society. The moment civilization is wise\r\nenough to remove the constraints and prohibitions which now hinder the\r\nrelease of inner energies, most of the larger evils of society will\r\nperish of inanition and malnutrition. Remove the moral taboos that now\r\nbind the human body and spirit, free the individual from the slavery\r\nof tradition, remove the chains of fear from men and women, above all\r\nanswer their unceasing cries for knowledge that would make possible\r\ntheir self-direction and salvation, and in so doing, you best serve\r\nthe interests of society at large. Free, rational and self-ruling\r\npersonality would then take the place of self-made slaves, who are\r\nthe victims both of external constraints and the playthings of the\r\nuncontrolled forces of their own instincts.\r\n\r\nScience likewise illuminates the whole problem of genius. Hidden in\r\nthe common stuff of humanity lies buried this power of self-expression.\r\nModern science is teaching us that genius is not some mysterious gift of\r\nthe gods, some treasure conferred upon individuals chosen by chance. Nor\r\nis it, as Lombroso believed, the result of a pathological and degenerate\r\ncondition, allied to criminality and madness. Rather is it due to the\r\nremoval of physiological and psychological inhibitions and constraints\r\nwhich makes possible the release and the channeling of the primordial\r\ninner energies of man into full and divine expression. The removal of\r\nthese inhibitions, so scientists assure us, makes possible more rapid\r\nand profound perceptions,--so rapid indeed that they seem to the\r\nordinary human being, practically instantaneous, or intuitive. The\r\nqualities of genius are not, therefore, qualities lacking in the common\r\nreservoir of humanity, but rather the unimpeded release and direction\r\nof powers latent in all of us. This process of course is not necessarily\r\nconscious.\r\n\r\nThis view is substantiated by the opposite problem of feeble-mindedness.\r\nRecent researches throw a new light on this problem and the contrasting\r\none of human genius. Mental defect and feeble-mindedness are conceived\r\nessentially as retardation, arrest of development, differing in degree\r\nso that the victim is either an idiot, an imbecile, feeble-minded or\r\na moron, according to the relative period at which mental development\r\nceases.\r\n\r\nScientific research into the functioning of the ductless glands and\r\ntheir secretions throws a new light on this problem. Not long ago these\r\nglands were a complete enigma, owing to the fact that they are not\r\nprovided with excretory ducts. It has just recently been shown that\r\nthese organs, such as the thyroid, the pituitary, the suprarenal,\r\nthe parathyroid and the reproductive glands, exercise an all-powerful\r\ninfluence upon the course of individual development or deficiency. Gley,\r\nto whom we owe much of our knowledge of glandular action, has asserted\r\nthat \"the genesis and exercise of the higher faculties of men are\r\nconditioned by the purely chemical action of the product of these\r\nsecretions. Let psychologists consider these facts.\"\r\n\r\nThese internal secretions or endocrines pass directly into the blood\r\nstream, and exercise a dominating power over health and personality.\r\nDeficiency in the thyroid secretion, especially during the years\r\nof infancy and early childhood, creates disorders of nutrition and\r\ninactivity of the nervous system. The particular form of idiocy known as\r\ncretinism is the result of this deficiency, which produces an arrest\r\nof the development of the brain cells. The other glands and their\r\nsecretions likewise exercise the most profound influence upon\r\ndevelopment, growth and assimilation. Most of these glands are of\r\nvery small size, none of them larger than a walnut, and some--the\r\nparathyroids--almost microscopic. Nevertheless, they are essential to\r\nthe proper maintenance of life in the body, and no less organically\r\nrelated to mental and psychic development as well.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive glands, it should not be forgotten, belong to this\r\ngroup, and besides their ordinary products, the germ and sperm cells\r\n(ova and spermatozoa) form HORMONES which circulate in the blood and\r\neffect changes in the cells of distant parts of the body. Through these\r\nHORMONES the secondary sexual characters are produced, including the\r\nmany differences in the form and structure of the body which are\r\nthe characteristics of the sexes. Only in recent years has science\r\ndiscovered that these secondary sexual characters are brought about by\r\nthe agency of these internal secretions or hormones, passed from\r\nthe reproductive glands into the circulating blood. These so-called\r\nsecondary characters which are the sign of full and healthy development,\r\nare dependent, science tells us, upon the state of development of the\r\nreproductive organs.\r\n\r\nFor a clear and illuminating account of the creative and dynamic power\r\nof the endocrine glands, the layman is referred to a recently published\r\nbook by Dr. Louis Berman.(2) This authority reveals anew how body and\r\nsoul are bound up together in a complex unity. Our spiritual and psychic\r\ndifficulties cannot be solved until we have mastered the knowledge of\r\nthe wellsprings of our being. \"The chemistry of the soul! Magnificent\r\nphrase!\" exclaims Dr. Berman. \"It's a long, long way to that goal. The\r\nexact formula is as yet far beyond our reach. But we have started upon\r\nthe long journey, and we shall get there.\r\n\r\n\"The internal secretions constitute and determine much of the inherited\r\npowers of the individual and their development. They control physical\r\nand mental growth, and all the metabolic processes of fundamental\r\nimportance. They dominate all the vital functions of man during the\r\nthree cycles of life. They cooperate in an intimate relationship which\r\nmay be compared to an interlocking directorate. A derangement of\r\ntheir functions, causing an insufficiency of them, an excess, or\r\nan abnormality, upsets the entire equilibrium of the body, with\r\ntransforming effects upon the mind and the organs. In short, they\r\ncontrol human nature, and whoever controls them, controls human\r\nnature....\r\n\r\n\"Blood chemistry of our time is a marvel, undreamed of a generation ago.\r\nAlso, these achievements are a perfect example of the accomplished fact\r\ncontradicting a prior prediction and criticism. For it was one of the\r\naccepted dogmas of the nineteenth century that the phenomena of living\r\ncould never be subjected to accurate quantitative analysis.\" But the\r\nethical dogmas of the past, no less than the scientific, may block the\r\nway to true civilization.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically as well as psychologically the development of the human\r\nbeing, the sane mind in the sound body, is absolutely dependent upon the\r\nfunctioning and exercise of all the organs in the body. The \"moralists\"\r\nwho preach abstinence, self-denial, and suppression are relegated by\r\nthese findings of impartial and disinterested science to the class of\r\nthose educators of the past who taught that it was improper for young\r\nladies to indulge in sports and athletics and who produced generations\r\nof feeble, undeveloped invalids, bound up by stays and addicted to\r\nswooning and hysterics. One need only go out on the street of any\r\nAmerican city to-day to be confronted with the victims of the cruel\r\nmorality of self-denial and \"sin.\" This fiendish \"morality\" is stamped\r\nupon those emaciated bodies, indelibly written in those emasculated,\r\nunderdeveloped, undernourished figures of men and women, in the nervous\r\ntension and unrelaxed muscles denoting the ceaseless vigilance in\r\nrestraining and suppressing the expression of natural impulses.\r\n\r\nBirth Control is no negative philosophy concerned solely with the number\r\nof children brought into this world. It is not merely a question of\r\npopulation. Primarily it is the instrument of liberation and of human\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIt points the way to a morality in which sexual expression and human\r\ndevelopment will not be in conflict with the interest and well-being of\r\nthe race nor of contemporary society at large. Not only is it the most\r\neffective, in fact the only lever by which the value of the child can be\r\nraised to a civilized point; but it is likewise the only method by which\r\nthe life of the individual can be deepened and strengthened, by which\r\nan inner peace and security and beauty may be substituted for the\r\ninner conflict that is at present so fatal to self-expression and\r\nself-realization.\r\n\r\nSublimation of the sexual instinct cannot take place by denying it\r\nexpression, nor by reducing it to the plane of the purely physiological.\r\nSexual experience, to be of contributory value, must be integrated and\r\nassimilated. Asceticism defeats its own purpose because it develops the\r\nobsession of licentious and obscene thoughts, the victim alternating\r\nbetween temporary victory over \"sin\" and the remorse of defeat. But\r\nthe seeker of purely physical pleasure, the libertine or the average\r\nsensualist, is no less a pathological case, living as one-sided and\r\nunbalanced a life as the ascetic, for his conduct is likewise based on\r\nignorance and lack of understanding. In seeking pleasure without the\r\nexercise of responsibility, in trying to get something for nothing, he\r\nis not merely cheating others but himself as well.\r\n\r\nIn still another field science and scientific method now emphasize the\r\npivotal importance of Birth Control. The Binet-Simon intelligence tests\r\nwhich have been developed, expanded, and applied to large groups of\r\nchildren and adults present positive statistical data concerning the\r\nmental equipment of the type of children brought into the world under\r\nthe influence of indiscriminate fecundity and of those fortunate\r\nchildren who have been brought into the world because they are wanted,\r\nthe children of conscious, voluntary procreation, well nourished,\r\nproperly clothed, the recipients of all that proper care and love can\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nIn considering the data furnished by these intelligence tests we should\r\nremember several factors that should be taken into consideration.\r\nIrrespective of other considerations, children who are underfed,\r\nundernourished, crowded into badly ventilated and unsanitary homes and\r\nchronically hungry cannot be expected to attain the mental development\r\nof children upon whom every advantage of intelligent and scientific\r\ncare is bestowed. Furthermore, public school methods of dealing with\r\nchildren, the course of studies prescribed, may quite completely fail to\r\nawaken and develop the intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe statistics indicate at any rate a surprisingly low rate of\r\nintelligence among the classes in which large families and uncontrolled\r\nprocreation predominate. Those of the lowest grade in intelligence\r\nare born of unskilled laborers (with the highest birth rate in the\r\ncommunity); the next high among the skilled laborers, and so on to the\r\nfamilies of professional people, among whom it is now admitted that the\r\nbirth rate is voluntarily controlled.(3)\r\n\r\nBut scientific investigations of this type cannot be complete\r\nuntil statistics are accurately obtained concerning the relation of\r\nunrestrained fecundity and the quality, mental and physical, of the\r\nchildren produced. The philosophy of Birth Control therefore seeks and\r\nasks the cooperation of science and scientists, not to strengthen its\r\nown \"case,\" but because this sexual factor in the determination of\r\nhuman history has so long been ignored by historians and scientists.\r\nIf science in recent years has contributed enormously to strengthen\r\nthe conviction of all intelligent people of the necessity and wisdom\r\nof Birth Control, this philosophy in its turn opens to science in its\r\nvarious fields a suggestive avenue of approach to many of those problems\r\nof humanity and society which at present seem to enigmatical and\r\ninsoluble.\r\n\r\n     (1)  Conklin, The Direction of Human Evolution, pp. 125,\r\n     126.\r\n\r\n     (2)  The Glands Regulating Personality: A study of the\r\n     glands of internal secretion in relation to the types of\r\n     human nature.

But as the wisest of\r\n     men saw twenty-five centuries ago, the things that are great\r\n     and strong and rigid are the things that stay below in the grave.\r\n     It is the things that are delicate and tender and supple that\r\n     stay above.  At no point is life so tender and delicate and\r\n     supple as at the point of sex.  There is the triumph of life.\"\r\n\r\n     Havelock Ellis\r\n\r\nOur approach opens to us a fresh scale of values, a new and effective\r\nmethod of testing the merits and demerits of current policies\r\nand programs. It redirects our attention to the great source and\r\nfountainhead of human life. It offers us the most strategic point\r\nof view from which to observe and study the unending drama of\r\nhumanity,--how the past, the present and the future of the human race\r\nare all organically bound up together. It coordinates heredity and\r\nenvironment. Most important of all, it frees the mind of sexual\r\nprejudice and taboo, by demanding the frankest and most unflinching\r\nreexamination of sex in its relation to human nature and the bases of\r\nhuman society. In aiding to establish this mental liberation,\r\nquite apart from any of the tangible results that might please the\r\nstatistically-minded, the study of Birth Control is performing an\r\ninvaluable task. Without complete mental freedom, it is impossible\r\nto approach any fundamental human problem. Failure to face the great\r\ncentral facts of sex in an impartial and scientific spirit lies at the\r\nroot of the blind opposition to Birth Control.\r\n\r\nOur bitterest opponents must agree that the problem of Birth Control\r\nis one of the most important that humanity to-day has to face. The\r\ninterests of the entire world, of humanity, of the future of mankind\r\nitself are more at stake in this than wars, political institutions, or\r\nindustrial reorganization. All other projects of reform, of revolution\r\nor reconstruction, are of secondary importance, even trivial, when we\r\ncompare them to the wholesale regeneration--or disintegration--that is\r\nbound up with the control, the direction and the release of one of the\r\ngreatest forces in nature. The great danger at present does not lie with\r\nthe bitter opponents of the idea of Birth Control, nor with those who\r\nare attempting to suppress our program of enlightenment and education.\r\nSuch opposition is always stimulating. It wins new adherents. It reveals\r\nits own weakness and lack of insight. The greater danger is to be found\r\nin the flaccid, undiscriminating interest of \"sympathizers\" who are \"for\r\nit\"--as an accessory to their own particular panacea. \"It even seems,\r\nsometimes,\" wrote the late William Graham Sumner, \"as if the primitive\r\npeople were working along better lines of effort in this direction than\r\nwe are... when our public organs of instruction taboo all that pertains\r\nto reproduction as improper; and when public authority, ready enough to\r\ninterfere with personal liberty everywhere else, feels bound to act as\r\nif there were no societal interest at stake in the begetting of the next\r\ngeneration.\"(1)\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely we are breaking down the taboos that surround sex; but\r\nwe are breaking them down out of sheer necessity. The codes that have\r\nsurrounded sexual behavior in the so-called Christian communities, the\r\nteachings of the churches concerning chastity and sexual purity, the\r\nprohibitions of the laws, and the hypocritical conventions of society,\r\nhave all demonstrated their failure as safeguards against the chaos\r\nproduced and the havoc wrought by the failure to recognize sex as a\r\ndriving force in human nature,--as great as, if indeed not greater than,\r\nhunger. Its dynamic energy is indestructible. It may be transmuted,\r\nrefined, directed, even sublimated, but to ignore, to neglect, to refuse\r\nto recognize this great elemental force is nothing less than foolhardy.\r\n\r\nOut of the unchallenged policies of continence, abstinence, \"chastity\"\r\nand \"purity,\" we have reaped the harvests of prostitution, venereal\r\nscourges and innumerable other evils. Traditional moralists have failed\r\nto recognize that chastity and purity must be the outward symptoms of\r\nawakened intelligence, of satisfied desires, and fulfilled love. They\r\ncannot be taught by \"sex education.\" They cannot be imposed from\r\nwithout by a denial of the might and the right of sexual expression.\r\nNevertheless, even in the contemporary teaching of sex hygiene and\r\nsocial prophylaxis, nothing constructive is offered to young men and\r\nyoung women who seek aid through the trying period of adolescence.\r\n\r\nAt the Lambeth Conference of 1920, the Bishops of the Church of England\r\nstated in their report on their considerations of sexual morality:\r\n\"Men should regard all women as they do their mothers, sisters, and\r\ndaughters; and women should dress only in such a manner as to command\r\nrespect from every man. All right-minded persons should unite in the\r\nsuppression of pernicious literature, plays and films....\" Could lack\r\nof psychological insight and understanding be more completely indicated?\r\nYet, like these bishops, most of those who are undertaking the education\r\nof the young are as ignorant themselves of psychology and physiology.\r\nIndeed, those who are speaking belatedly of the need of \"sexual hygiene\"\r\nseem to be unaware that they themselves are most in need of it. \"We must\r\ngive up the futile attempt to keep young people in the dark,\" cries Rev.\r\nJames Marchant in \"Birth-Rate and Empire,\" \"and the assumption that they\r\nare ignorant of notorious facts. We cannot, if we would, stop the spread\r\nof sexual knowledge; and if we could do so, we would only make matters\r\ninfinitely worse. This is the second decade of the twentieth century,\r\nnot the early Victorian period.... It is no longer a question of knowing\r\nor not knowing. We have to disabuse our middle-aged minds of that fond\r\ndelusion. Our young people know more than we did when we began our\r\nmarried lives, and sometimes as much as we know, ourselves, even now. So\r\nthat we need not continue to shake our few remaining hairs in simulating\r\nfeelings of surprise or horror. It might have been better for us if we\r\nhad been more enlightened. And if our discussion of this problem is to\r\nbe of any real use, we must at the outset reconcile ourselves to the\r\nfact that the birth-rate is voluntarily controlled.... Certain persons\r\nwho instruct us in these matters hold up their pious hands and whiten\r\ntheir frightened faces as they cry out in the public squares against\r\n`this vice,' but they can only make themselves ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nTaught upon the basis of conventional and traditional morality and\r\nmiddle-class respectability, based on current dogma, and handed down to\r\nthe populace with benign condescension, sex education is a waste of time\r\nand effort. Such education cannot in any true sense set up as a standard\r\nthe ideal morality and behavior of the respectable middle-class and then\r\nmake the effort to induce all other members of society, especially the\r\nworking classes, to conform to their taboos. Such a method is not only\r\nconfusing, but, in the creation of strain and hysteria and an unhealthy\r\nconcentration upon moral conduct, results in positive injury. To preach\r\na negative and colorless ideal of chastity to young men and women is\r\nto neglect the primary duty of awakening their intelligence, their\r\nresponsibility, their self-reliance and independence. Once this is\r\naccomplished, the matter of chastity will take care of itself. The\r\nteaching of \"etiquette\" must be superseded by the teaching of hygiene.\r\nHygienic habits are built up upon a sound knowledge of bodily needs\r\nand functions. It is only in the sphere of sex that there remains an\r\nunfounded fear of presenting without the gratuitous introduction of\r\nnon-essential taboos and prejudice, unbiased and unvarnished facts.\r\n\r\nAs an instrument of education, the doctrine of Birth Control approaches\r\nthe whole problem in another manner. Instead of laying down hard and\r\nfast laws of sexual conduct, instead of attempting to inculcate rules\r\nand regulations, of pointing out the rewards of virtue and the penalties\r\nof \"sin\" (as is usually attempted in relation to the venereal diseases),\r\nthe teacher of Birth Control seeks to meet the needs of the people.\r\nUpon the basis of their interests, their demands, their problems, Birth\r\nControl education attempts to develop their intelligence and show them\r\nhow they may help themselves; how to guide and control this deep-rooted\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nThe objection has been raised that Birth Control only reaches the\r\nalready enlightened, the men and women who have already attained a\r\ndegree of self-respect and self-reliance. Such an objection could not be\r\nbased on fact. Even in the most unenlightened sections of the community,\r\namong mothers crushed by poverty and economic enslavement, there is\r\nthe realization of the evils of the too-large family, of the rapid\r\nsuccession of pregnancy after pregnancy, of the hopelessness of bringing\r\ntoo many children into the world. Not merely in the evidence presented\r\nin an earlier chapter but in other ways, is this crying need expressed.\r\nThe investigators of the Children's Bureau who collected the data of the\r\ninfant mortality reports, noted the willingness and the eagerness with\r\nwhich these down-trodden mothers told the truth about themselves.\r\nSo great is their hope of relief from that meaningless and deadening\r\nsubmission to unproductive reproduction, that only a society pruriently\r\ndevoted to hypocrisy could refuse to listen to the voices of these\r\nmothers. Respectfully we lend our ears to dithyrambs about the\r\nsacredness of motherhood and the value of \"better babies\"--but we shut\r\nour eyes and our ears to the unpleasant reality and the cries of pain\r\nthat come from women who are to-day dying by the thousands because this\r\npower is withheld from them.\r\n\r\nThis situation is rendered more bitterly ironic because the\r\nself-righteous opponents of Birth Control practise themselves the\r\ndoctrine they condemn. The birth-rate among conservative opponents\r\nindicates that they restrict the numbers of their own children by the\r\nmethods of Birth Control, or are of such feeble procreative energy as to\r\nbe thereby unfitted to dictate moral laws for other people. They prefer\r\nthat we should think their small number of children is accidental,\r\nrather than publicly admit the successful practice of intelligent\r\nforesight. Or else they hold themselves up as paragons of virtue and\r\nself-control, and would have us believe that they have brought their\r\nchildren into the world solely from a high, stern sense of public\r\nduty--an attitude which is about as convincing as it would be to declare\r\nthat they found them under gooseberry bushes. How else can we explain\r\nthe widespread tolerance and smug approval of the clerical idea of\r\nsex, now reenforced by floods of crude and vulgar sentiment, which is\r\npromulgated by the press, motion-pictures and popular plays?\r\n\r\nLike all other education, that of sex can be rendered effective and\r\nvaluable only as it meets and satisfies the interests and demands of\r\nthe pupil himself. It cannot be imposed from without, handed down from\r\nabove, superimposed upon the intelligence of the person taught. It\r\nmust find a response within him, give him the power and the instrument\r\nwherewith he may exercise his own growing intelligence, bring into\r\naction his own judgment and discrimination and thus contribute to the\r\ngrowth of his intelligence. The civilized world is coming to see\r\nthat education cannot consist merely in the assimilation of external\r\ninformation and knowledge, but rather in the awakening and development\r\nof innate powers of discrimination and judgment. The great disaster of\r\n\"sex education\" lies in the fact that it fails to direct the awakened\r\ninterests of the pupils into the proper channels of exercise and\r\ndevelopment. Instead, it blunts them, restricts them, hinders them, and\r\neven attempts to eradicate them.\r\n\r\nThis has been the great defect of sex education as it has been practised\r\nin recent years. Based on a superficial and shameful view of the sexual\r\ninstinct, it has sought the inculcation of negative virtues by pointing\r\nout the sinister penalties of promiscuity, and by advocating strict\r\nadherence to virtue and morality, not on the basis of intelligence or\r\nthe outcome of experience, not even for the attainment of rewards, but\r\nmerely to avoid punishment in the form of painful and malignant\r\ndisease. Education so conceived carries with it its own refutation. True\r\neducation cannot tolerate the inculcation of fear. Fear is the soil in\r\nwhich are implanted inhibitions and morbid compulsions. Fear restrains,\r\nrestricts, hinders human expression. It strikes at the very roots of joy\r\nand happiness. It should therefore be the aim of sex education to avoid\r\nabove all the implanting of fear in the mind of the pupil.\r\n\r\nRestriction means placing in the hands of external authority the power\r\nover behavior. Birth Control, on the contrary, implies voluntary action,\r\nthe decision for one's self how many children one shall or shall not\r\nbring into the world. Birth Control is educational in the real sense\r\nof the word, in that it asserts this power of decision, reinstates this\r\npower in the people themselves.\r\n\r\nWe are not seeking to introduce new restrictions but greater freedom. As\r\nfar as sex is concerned, the impulse has been more thoroughly subject to\r\nrestriction than any other human instinct. \"Thou shalt not!\" meets us at\r\nevery turn. Some of these restrictions are justified; some of them are\r\nnot. We may have but one wife or one husband at a time; we must attain a\r\ncertain age before we may marry. Children born out of wedlock are deemed\r\n\"illegitimate\"--even healthy children. The newspapers every day are\r\nfilled with the scandals of those who have leaped over the restrictions\r\nor limitations society has written in her sexual code. Yet the voluntary\r\ncontrol of the procreative powers, the rational regulation of the number\r\nof children we bring into the world--this is the one type of restriction\r\nfrowned upon and prohibited by law!\r\n\r\nIn a more definite, a much more realistic and concrete manner, Birth\r\nControl reveals itself as the most effective weapon in the spread of\r\nhygienic and prophylactic knowledge among women of the less fortunate\r\nclasses. It carries with it a thorough training in bodily cleanliness\r\nand physiology, a definite knowledge of the physiology and function\r\nof sex. In refusing to teach both sides of the subject, in failing to\r\nrespond to the universal demand among women for such instruction and\r\ninformation, maternity centers limit their own efforts and fail to\r\nfulfil what should be their true mission. They are concerned merely with\r\npregnancy, maternity, child-bearing, the problem of keeping the baby\r\nalive. But any effective work in this field must go further back. We\r\nhave gradually come to see, as Havelock Ellis has pointed out, that\r\ncomparatively little can be done by improving merely the living\r\nconditions of adults; that improving conditions for children and babies\r\nis not enough. To combat the evils of infant mortality, natal and\r\npre-natal care is not sufficient. Even to improve the conditions for the\r\npregnant woman, is insufficient. Necessarily and inevitably, we are led\r\nfurther and further back, to the point of procreation; beyond that, into\r\nthe regulation of sexual selection. The problem becomes a circle. We\r\ncannot solve one part of it without a consideration of the entirety. But\r\nit is especially at the point of creation where all the various\r\nforces are concentrated. Conception must be controlled by reason, by\r\nintelligence, by science, or we lose control of all its consequences.\r\n\r\nBirth Control is essentially an education for women. It is women who,\r\ndirectly and by their very nature, bear the burden of that blindness,\r\nignorance and lack of foresight concerning sex which is now enforced\r\nby law and custom. Birth Control places in the hands of women the\r\nonly effective instrument whereby they may reestablish the balance in\r\nsociety, and assert, not only theoretically but practically as well, the\r\nprimary importance of the woman and the child in civilization.\r\n\r\nBirth Control is thus the stimulus to education. Its exercise awakens\r\nand develops the sense of self-reliance and responsibility, and\r\nilluminates the relation of the individual to society and to the race in\r\na manner that otherwise remains vague and academic. It reveals sex not\r\nmerely as an untamed and insatiable natural force to which men and women\r\nmust submit hopelessly and inertly, as it sweeps through them, and then\r\naccept with abject humility the hopeless and heavy consequences.\r\nInstead, it places in their hands the power to control this great force;\r\nto use it, to direct it into channels in which it becomes the\r\nenergy enhancing their lives and increasing self-expression and\r\nself-development. It awakens in women the consciousness of new glories\r\nand new possibilities in motherhood. No longer the prostrate victim of\r\nthe blind play of instinct but the self-reliant mistress of her body and\r\nher own will, the new mother finds in her child the fulfilment of her\r\nown desires. In free instead of compulsory motherhood she finds the\r\navenue of her own development and expression. No longer bound by an\r\nunending series of pregnancies, at liberty to safeguard the development\r\nof her own children, she may now extend her beneficent influence beyond\r\nher own home. In becoming thus intensified, motherhood may also broaden\r\nand become more extensive as well. The mother sees that the welfare of\r\nher own children is bound up with the welfare of all others. Not upon\r\nthe basis of sentimental charity or gratuitous \"welfare-work\" but upon\r\nthat of enlightened self-interest, such a mother may exert her influence\r\namong the less fortunate and less enlightened.\r\n\r\nUnless based upon this central knowledge of and power over her own body\r\nand her own instincts, education for woman is valueless. As long as she\r\nremains the plaything of strong, uncontrolled natural forces, as long as\r\nshe must docilely and humbly submit to the decisions of others, how\r\ncan woman ever lay the foundations of self-respect, self-reliance\r\nand independence? How can she make her own choice, exercise her own\r\ndiscrimination, her own foresight?\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of these powers, in the building up and integration of\r\nher own experience, in mastering her own environment the true education\r\nof woman must be sought. And in the sphere of sex, the great source and\r\nroot of all human experience, it is upon the basis of Birth Control--the\r\nvoluntary direction of her own sexual expression--that woman must take\r\nher first step in the assertion of freedom and self-respect.\r\n\r\n     (1)  Folkways, p. 492.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII: Woman and the Future\r\n\r\n     I saw a woman sleeping.  In her sleep she dreamed Life stood\r\n     before her, and held in each hand a gift--in the one Love, in\r\n     the other Freedom.  And she said to the woman, \"Choose!\"\r\n\r\n     And the woman waited long:  and she said, \"Freedom!\"\r\n\r\n     And Life said, \"Thou has well chosen.  If thou hadst said,\r\n     `Love,' I would have given thee that thou didst ask for; and\r\n     I would have gone from thee, and returned to thee no more.\r\n     Now, the day will come when I shall return.  In that day I\r\n     shall bear both gifts in one hand.\"\r\n\r\n     I heard the woman laugh in her sleep.\r\n\r\n     Olive Schreiner\r\n\r\nBy no means is it necessary to look forward to some vague and distant\r\ndate of the future to test the benefits which the human race derives\r\nfrom the program I have suggested in the preceding pages. The results to\r\nthe individual woman, to the family, and to the State, particularly in\r\nthe case of Holland, have already been investigated and recorded. Our\r\nphilosophy is no doctrine of escape from the immediate and pressing\r\nrealities of life, on the contrary, we say to men and women, and\r\nparticularly to the latter: face the realities of your own soul and\r\nbody; know thyself! And in this last admonition, we mean that this\r\nknowledge should not consist of some vague shopworn generalities about\r\nthe nature of woman--woman as created in the minds of men, nor woman\r\nputting herself on a romantic pedestal above the harsh facts of this\r\nworkaday world. Women can attain freedom only by concrete, definite\r\nknowledge of themselves, a knowledge based on biology, physiology and\r\npsychology.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it would be wrong to shut our eyes to the vision of a\r\nworld of free men and women, a world which would more closely resemble\r\na garden than the present jungle of chaotic conflicts and fears. One of\r\nthe greatest dangers of social idealists, to all of us who hope to make\r\na better world, is to seek refuge in highly colored fantasies of the\r\nfuture rather than to face and combat the bitter and evil realities\r\nwhich to-day on all sides confront us. I believe that the reader of\r\nmy preceding chapters will not accuse me of shirking these realities;\r\nindeed, he may think that I have overemphasized the great biological\r\nproblems of defect, delinquency and bad breeding. It is in the hope that\r\nothers too may glimpse my vision of a world regenerated that I submit\r\nthe following suggestions. They are based on the belief that we must\r\nseek individual and racial health not by great political or social\r\nreconstruction, but, turning to a recognition of our own inherent powers\r\nand development, by the release of our inner energies. It is thus that\r\nall of us can best aid in making of this world, instead of a vale of\r\ntears, a garden.\r\n\r\nLet us first of all consider merely from the viewpoint of business and\r\n\"efficiency\" the biological or racial problems which confront us.\r\nAs Americans, we have of late made much of \"efficiency\" and business\r\norganization. Yet would any corporation for one moment conduct its\r\naffairs as we conduct the infinitely more important affairs of our\r\ncivilization? Would any modern stockbreeder permit the deterioration\r\nof his livestock as we not only permit but positively encourage the\r\ndestruction and deterioration of the most precious, the most essential\r\nelements in our world community--the mothers and children. With the\r\nmothers and children thus cheapened, the next generation of men and\r\nwomen is inevitably below par. The tendency of the human elements, under\r\npresent conditions, is constantly downward.\r\n\r\nTurn to Robert M. Yerkes's \"Psychological Examining in the United States\r\nArmy\"(1) in which we are informed that the psychological examination\r\nof the drafted men indicated that nearly half--47.3 per cent.--of the\r\npopulation had the mentality of twelve-year-old children or less--in\r\nother words that they are morons. Professor Conklin, in his recently\r\npublished volume \"The Direction of Human Evolution\"(2) is led, on the\r\nfindings of Mr. Yerkes's report, to assert: \"Assuming that these\r\ndrafted men are a fair sample of the entire population of approximately\r\n100,000,000, this means that 45,000,000 or nearly one-half the entire\r\npopulation, will never develop mental capacity beyond the stage\r\nrepresented by a normal twelve-year-old child, and that only 13,500,000\r\nwill ever show superior intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nMaking all due allowances for the errors and discrepancies of the\r\npsychological examination, we are nevertheless face to face with a\r\nserious and destructive practice. Our \"overhead\" expense in segregating\r\nthe delinquent, the defective and the dependent, in prisons, asylums and\r\npermanent homes, our failure to segregate morons who are increasing\r\nand multiplying--I have sufficiently indicated, though in truth I have\r\nmerely scratched the surface of this international menace--demonstrate\r\nour foolhardy and extravagant sentimentalism. No industrial corporation\r\ncould maintain its existence upon such a foundation. Yet hardheaded\r\n\"captains of industry,\" financiers who pride themselves upon their\r\ncool-headed and keen-sighted business ability are dropping millions\r\ninto rosewater philanthropies and charities that are silly at best and\r\nvicious at worst. In our dealings with such elements there is a\r\nbland maladministration and misuse of huge sums that should in all\r\nrighteousness be used for the development and education of the healthy\r\nelements of the community.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, civilized nations are penalizing talent and genius,\r\nthe bearers of the torch of civilization, to coddle and perpetuate\r\nthe choking human undergrowth, which, as all authorities tell us, is\r\nescaping control and threatens to overrun the whole garden of humanity.\r\nYet men continue to drug themselves with the opiate of optimism, or\r\nsink back upon the cushions of Christian resignation, their intellectual\r\npowers anaesthetized by cheerful platitudes. Or else, even those, who\r\nare fully cognizant of the chaos and conflict, seek an escape in those\r\npretentious but fundamentally fallacious social philosophies which place\r\nthe blame for contemporary world misery upon anybody or anything except\r\nthe indomitable but uncontrolled instincts of living organisms. These\r\nmen fight with shadows and forget the realities of existence. Too many\r\ncenturies have we sought to hide from the inevitable, which confronts us\r\nat every step throughout life.\r\n\r\nLet us conceive for the moment at least, a world not burdened by the\r\nweight of dependent and delinquent classes, a total population of\r\nmature, intelligent, critical and expressive men and women. Instead\r\nof the inert, exploitable, mentally passive class which now forms the\r\nbarren substratum of our civilization, try to imagine a population\r\nactive, resistant, passing individual and social lives of the most\r\ncontented and healthy sort. Would such men and women, liberated from\r\nour endless, unceasing struggle against mass prejudice and inertia, be\r\ndeprived in any way of the stimulating zest of life? Would they sink\r\ninto a slough of complacency and fatuity?\r\n\r\nNo! Life for them would be enriched, intensified and ennobled in a\r\nfashion it is difficult for us in our spiritual and physical squalor\r\neven to imagine. There would be a new renaissance of the arts and\r\nsciences. Awakened at last to the proximity of the treasures of life\r\nlying all about them, the children of that age would be inspired by a\r\nspirit of adventure and romance that would indeed produce a terrestrial\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\nLet us look forward to this great release of creative and constructive\r\nenergy, not as an idle, vacuous mirage, but as a promise which we, as\r\nthe whole human race, have it in our power, in the very conduct of our\r\nlives from day to day, to transmute into a glorious reality. Let us\r\nlook forward to that era, perhaps not so distant as we believe, when the\r\ngreat adventures in the enchanted realm of the arts and sciences may no\r\nlonger be the privilege of a gifted few, but the rightful heritage of\r\na race of genius. In such a world men and women would no longer seek\r\nescape from themselves by the fantastic and the faraway. They would be\r\nawakened to the realization that the source of life, of happiness, is to\r\nbe found not outside themselves, but within, in the healthful exercise\r\nof their God-given functions. The treasures of life are not hidden; they\r\nare close at hand, so close that we overlook them. We cheat ourselves\r\nwith a pitiful fear of ourselves. Men and women of the future will not\r\nseek happiness; they will have gone beyond it. Mere happiness would\r\nproduce monotony. And their lives shall be lives of change and variety\r\nwith the thrills produced by experiment and research.\r\n\r\nFear will have been abolished: first of all, the fear of outside things\r\nand other people; finally the fear of oneself. And with these fears\r\nmust disappear forever all those poisons of hatreds, individual and\r\ninternational. For the realization would come that there would be no\r\nreason for, no value in encroaching upon, the freedom of one another.\r\nTo-day we are living in a world which is like a forest of trees too\r\nthickly planted. Hence the ferocious, unending struggle for existence.\r\nLike innumerable ages past, the present age is one of mutual\r\ndestruction. Our aim is to substitute cooperation, equity, and amity for\r\nantagonism and conflict. If the aim of our country or our civilization\r\nis to attain a hollow, meaningless superiority over others in aggregate\r\nwealth and population, it may be sound policy to shut our eyes to\r\nthe sacrifice of human life,--unregarded life and suffering--and to\r\nstimulate rapid procreation. But even so, such a policy is bound in\r\nthe long run to defeat itself, as the decline and fall of great\r\ncivilizations of the past emphatically indicate. Even the bitterest\r\nopponent of our ideals would refuse to subscribe to a philosophy of mere\r\nquantity, of wealth and population lacking in spiritual direction or\r\nsignificance. All of us hope for and look forward to the fine flowering\r\nof human genius--of genius not expending and dissipating its energy\r\nin the bitter struggle for mere existence, but developing to a fine\r\nmaturity, sustained and nourished by the soil of active appreciation,\r\ncriticism, and recognition.\r\n\r\nNot by denying the central and basic biological facts of our nature, not\r\nby subscribing to the glittering but false values of any philosophy or\r\nprogram of escape, not by wild Utopian dreams of the brotherhood of men,\r\nnot by any sanctimonious debauch of sentimentality or religiosity, may\r\nwe accomplish the first feeble step toward liberation. On the contrary,\r\nonly by firmly planting our feet on the solid ground of scientific fact\r\nmay we even stand erect--may we even rise from the servile stooping\r\nposture of the slave, borne down by the weight of age-old oppression.\r\n\r\nIn looking forward to this radiant release of the inner energies of\r\na regenerated humanity, I am not thinking merely of inventions and\r\ndiscoveries and the application of these to the perfecting of the\r\nexternal and mechanical details of social life. This external and\r\nscientific perfecting of the mechanism of external life is a phenomenon\r\nwe are to a great extent witnessing today. But in a deeper sense this\r\ntendency can be of no true or lasting value if it cannot be made to\r\nsubserve the biological and spiritual development of the human organism,\r\nindividual and collective. Our great problem is not merely to perfect\r\nmachinery, to produce superb ships, motor cars or great buildings, but\r\nto remodel the race so that it may equal the amazing progress we see\r\nnow making in the externals of life. We must first free our bodies from\r\ndisease and predisposition to disease. We must perfect these bodies and\r\nmake them fine instruments of the mind and the spirit. Only thus, when\r\nthe body becomes an aid instead of a hindrance to human expression may\r\nwe attain any civilization worthy of the name. Only thus may we create\r\nour bodies a fitting temple for the soul, which is nothing but a vague\r\nunreality except insofar as it is able to manifest itself in the beauty\r\nof the concrete.\r\n\r\nOnce we have accomplished the first tentative steps toward the creation\r\nof a real civilization, the task of freeing the spirit of mankind from\r\nthe bondage of ignorance, prejudice and mental passivity which is more\r\nfettering now than ever in the history of humanity, will be facilitated\r\na thousand-fold. The great central problem, and one which must be taken\r\nfirst is the abolition of the shame and fear of sex. We must teach\r\nmen the overwhelming power of this radiant force. We must make them\r\nunderstand that uncontrolled, it is a cruel tyrant, but that controlled\r\nand directed, it may be used to transmute and sublimate the everyday\r\nworld into a realm of beauty and joy. Through sex, mankind may attain\r\nthe great spiritual illumination which will transform the world,\r\nwhich will light up the only path to an earthly paradise. So must we\r\nnecessarily and inevitably conceive of sex-expression. The instinct is\r\nhere. None of us can avoid it. It is in our power to make it a thing\r\nof beauty and a joy forever: or to deny it, as have the ascetics of the\r\npast, to revile this expression and then to pay the penalty, the bitter\r\npenalty that Society to-day is paying in innumerable ways.\r\n\r\nIf I am criticized for the seeming \"selfishness\" of this conception it\r\nwill be through a misunderstanding. The individual is fulfiling his duty\r\nto society as a whole by not self-sacrifice but by self-development. He\r\ndoes his best for the world not by dying for it, not by increasing the\r\nsum total of misery, disease and unhappiness, but by increasing his\r\nown stature, by releasing a greater energy, by being active instead\r\nof passive, creative instead of destructive. This is fundamentally the\r\ngreatest truth to be discovered by womankind at large. And until\r\nwomen are awakened to their pivotal function in the creation of a new\r\ncivilization, that new era will remain an impossible and fantastic\r\ndream. The new civilization can become a glorious reality only with the\r\nawakening of woman's now dormant qualities of strength, courage, and\r\nvigor. As a great thinker of the last century pointed out, not only\r\nto her own health and happiness is the physical degeneracy of woman\r\ndestructive, but to our whole race. The physical and psychic power of\r\nwoman is more indispensable to the well-being and power of the human\r\nrace than that even of man, for the strength and happiness of the child\r\nis more organically united with that of the mother.\r\n\r\nParallel with the awakening of woman's interest in her own fundamental\r\nnature, in her realization that her greatest duty to society lies\r\nin self-realization, will come a greater and deeper love for all of\r\nhumanity. For in attaining a true individuality of her own she will\r\nunderstand that we are all individuals, that each human being is\r\nessentially implicated in every question or problem which involves the\r\nwell-being of the humblest of us. So to-day we are not to meet the\r\ngreat problems of defect and delinquency in any merely sentimental or\r\nsuperficial manner, but with the firmest and most unflinching attitude\r\ntoward the true interest of our fellow beings. It is from no mere\r\nfeeling of brotherly love or sentimental philanthropy that we women must\r\ninsist upon enhancing the value of child life. It is because we know\r\nthat, if our children are to develop to their full capabilities, all\r\nchildren must be assured a similar opportunity. Every single case of\r\ninherited defect, every malformed child, every congenitally tainted\r\nhuman being brought into this world is of infinite importance to that\r\npoor individual; but it is of scarcely less importance to the rest of us\r\nand to all of our children who must pay in one way or another for these\r\nbiological and racial mistakes. We look forward in our vision of the\r\nfuture to children brought into the world because they are desired,\r\ncalled from the unknown by a fearless and conscious passion, because\r\nwomen and men need children to complete the symmetry of their own\r\ndevelopment, no less than to perpetuate the race. They shall be called\r\ninto a world enhanced and made beautiful by the spirit of freedom and\r\nromance--into a world wherein the creatures of our new day, unhampered\r\nand unbound by the sinister forces of prejudice and immovable habit, may\r\nwork out their own destinies. Perhaps we may catch fragmentary glimpses\r\nof this new life in certain societies of the past, in Greece perhaps;\r\nbut in all of these past civilizations these happy groups formed but a\r\nsmall exclusive section of the population. To-day our task is greater;\r\nfor we realize that no section of humanity can be reclaimed without the\r\nregeneration of the whole.\r\n\r\nI look, therefore, into a Future when men and women will not dissipate\r\ntheir energy in the vain and fruitless search for content outside of\r\nthemselves, in far-away places or people. Perfect masters of their own\r\ninherent powers, controlled with a fine understanding of the art of life\r\nand of love, adapting themselves with pliancy and intelligence to the\r\nmilieu in which they find themselves, they will unafraid enjoy life to\r\nthe utmost. Women will for the first time in the unhappy history of\r\nthis globe establish a true equilibrium and \"balance of power\" in the\r\nrelation of the sexes. The old antagonism will have disappeared, the old\r\nill-concealed warfare between men and women. For the men themselves will\r\ncomprehend that in this cultivation of the human garden they will be\r\nrewarded a thousand times. Interest in the vague sentimental fantasies\r\nof extra-mundane existence, in pathological or hysterical flights from\r\nthe realities of our earthliness, will have through atrophy disappeared,\r\nfor in that dawn men and women will have come to the realization,\r\nalready suggested, that here close at hand is our paradise, our\r\neverlasting abode, our Heaven and our eternity. Not by leaving it and\r\nour essential humanity behind us, nor by sighing to be anything but what\r\nwe are, shall we ever become ennobled or immortal. Not for woman only,\r\nbut for all of humanity is this the field where we must seek the secret\r\nof eternal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1)  Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences.

Those\r\nleast fit to carry on the race are increasing most rapidly. People who\r\ncannot support their own offspring are encouraged by Church and State to\r\nproduce large families. Many of the children thus begotten are diseased\r\nor feeble-minded; many become criminals. The burden of supporting these\r\nunwanted types has to be bourne by the healthy elements of the nation.\r\nFunds that should be used to raise the standard of our civilization are\r\ndiverted to the maintenance of those who should never have been born.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this grave evil we witness the appalling waste of women's\r\nhealth and women's lives by too frequent pregnancies. These unwanted\r\npregnancies often provoke the crime of abortion, or alternatively\r\nmultiply the number of child-workers and lower the standard of living.\r\n\r\nTo create a race of well born children it is essential that the function\r\nof motherhood should be elevated to a position of dignity, and this is\r\nimpossible as long as conception remains a matter of chance.\r\n\r\nWe hold that children should be\r\n\r\n1. Conceived in love;\r\n\r\n2. Born of the mother's conscious desire;\r\n\r\n3. And only begotten under conditions which render possible the heritage\r\nof health.\r\n\r\nTherefore we hold that every woman must possess the power and freedom to\r\nprevent conception except when these conditions can be satisfied.\r\n\r\nEvery mother must realize her basic position in human society. She must\r\nbe conscious of her responsibility to the race in bringing children into\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nInstead of being a blind and haphazard consequence of uncontrolled\r\ninstinct, motherhood must be made the responsible and self-directed\r\nmeans of human expression and regeneration.\r\n\r\nThese purposes, which are of fundamental importance to the whole of our\r\nnation and to the future of mankind, can only be attained if women first\r\nreceive practical scientific education in the means of Birth Control.\r\nThat, therefore, is the first object to which the efforts of this League\r\nwill be directed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIMS:\r\n\r\nThe American Birth Control League aims to enlighten and educate all\r\nsections of the American public in the various aspects of the dangers of\r\nuncontrolled procreation and the imperative necessity of a world program\r\nof Birth Control.\r\n\r\nThe League aims to correlate the findings of scientists, statisticians,\r\ninvestigators, and social agencies in all fields. To make this possible,\r\nit is necessary to organize various departments:\r\n\r\nRESEARCH: To collect the findings of scientists, concerning the relation\r\nof reckless breeding to the evils of delinquency, defect and dependence.\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION: To derive from these scientifically ascertained facts and\r\nfigures, conclusions which may aid all public health and social agencies\r\nin the study of problems of maternal and infant mortality, child-labor,\r\nmental and physical defects and delinquence in relation to the practice\r\nof reckless parentage.\r\n\r\nHYGIENIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL instruction by the Medical profession to\r\nmothers and potential mothers in harmless and reliable methods of Birth\r\nControl in answer to their requests for such knowledge.\r\n\r\nSTERILIZATION of the insane and feebleminded and the encouragement of\r\nthis operation upon those afflicted with inherited or transmissible\r\ndiseases, with the understanding that sterilization does not deprive\r\nthe individual of his or her sex expression, but merely renders him\r\nincapable of producing children.\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL: The program of education includes: The enlightenment of the\r\npublic at large, mainly through the education of leaders of thought\r\nand opinion--teachers, ministers, editors and writers--to the moral\r\nand scientific soundness of the principles of Birth Control and the\r\nimperative necessity of its adoption as the basis of national and racial\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND LEGISLATIVE: To enlist the support and cooperation of\r\nlegal advisers, statesmen and legislators in effecting the removal of\r\nstate and federal statutes which encourage dysgenic breeding,\r\nincrease the sum total of disease, misery and poverty and prevent the\r\nestablishment of a policy of national health and strength.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION: To send into the various States of the Union field workers\r\nto enlist the support and arouse the interest of the masses, to\r\nthe importance of Birth Control so that laws may be changed and the\r\nestablishment of clinics made possible in every State.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL: This department aims to cooperate with similar\r\norganizations in other countries to study Birth Control in its relations\r\nto the world population problem, food supplies, national and racial\r\nconflicts, and to urge upon all international bodies organized to\r\npromote world peace, the consideration of these aspects of international\r\namity.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN BIRTH CONTROL LEAGUE proposes to publish in its\r\nofficial organ \"The Birth Control Review,\" reports and studies on the\r\nrelationship of controlled and uncontrolled populations to national and\r\nworld problems.\r\n\r\nThe American Birth Control League also proposes to hold an annual\r\nConference to bring together the workers of the various departments so\r\nthat each worker may realize the inter-relationship of all the various\r\nphases of the problem to the end that National education will tend to\r\nencourage and develop the powers of self-direction, self-reliance, and\r\nindependence in the individuals of the community instead of dependence\r\nfor relief upon public or private charities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Pivot of Civilization, by Margaret Sanger",
