In performing for the first time the duty imposed on me by the\r\nConstitution of giving to you information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommending to your consideration such measures as in my judgment are\r\nnecessary and expedient, I am happy that I can congratulate you on the\r\ncontinued prosperity of our country. Under the blessings of Divine\r\nProvidence and the benign influence of our free institutions, it stands\r\nbefore the world a spectacle of national happiness.\r\n\r\nWith our unexampled advancement in all the elements of national greatness,\r\nthe affection of the people is confirmed for the Union of the States and\r\nfor the doctrines of popular liberty which lie at the foundation of our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt becomes us in humility to make our devout acknowledgments to the Supreme\r\nRuler of the Universe for the inestimable civil and religious blessings\r\nwith which we are favored.\r\n\r\nIn calling the attention of Congress to our relations with foreign powers,\r\nI am gratified to be able to state that though with some of them there have\r\nexisted since your last session serious causes of irritation and\r\nmisunderstanding, yet no actual hostilities have taken place. Adopting the\r\nmaxim in the conduct of our foreign affairs \"to ask nothing that is not\r\nright and submit to nothing that is wrong,\" it has been my anxious desire\r\nto preserve peace with all nations, but at the same time to be prepared to\r\nresist aggression and maintain all our just rights.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress \"for annexing Texas to the\r\nUnited States,\" my predecessor, on the 3d day of March, 1845, elected to\r\nsubmit the first and second sections of that resolution to the Republic of\r\nTexas as an overture on the part of the United States for her admission as\r\na State into our Union. This election I approved, and accordingly the\r\ncharge d'affaires of the United States in Texas, under instructions of the\r\n10th of March, 1845, presented these sections of the resolution for the\r\nacceptance of that Republic. The executive government, the Congress, and\r\nthe people of Texas in convention have successively complied with all the\r\nterms and conditions of the joint resolution. A constitution for the\r\ngovernment of the State of Texas, formed by a convention of deputies, is\r\nherewith laid before Congress. It is well known, also, that the people of\r\nTexas at the polls have accepted the terms of annexation and ratified the\r\nconstitution. I communicate to Congress the correspondence between the\r\nSecretary of State and our charge d'affaires in Texas, and also the\r\ncorrespondence of the latter with the authorities of Texas, together with\r\nthe official documents transmitted by him to his own Government. The terms\r\nof annexation which were offered by the United States having been accepted\r\nby Texas, the public faith of both parties is solemnly pledged to the\r\ncompact of their union. Nothing remains to consummate the event but the\r\npassage of an act by Congress to admit the State of Texas into the Union\r\nupon an equal footing with the original States. Strong reasons exist why\r\nthis should be done at an early period of the session. It will be observed\r\nthat by the constitution of Texas the existing government is only continued\r\ntemporarily till Congress can act, and that the third Monday of the present\r\nmonth is the day appointed for holding the first general election. On that\r\nday a governor, a lieutenant-governor, and both branches of the legislature\r\nwill be chosen by the people. The President of Texas is required,\r\nimmediately after the receipt of official information that the new State\r\nhas been admitted into our Union by Congress, to convene the legislature,\r\nand upon its meeting the existing government will be superseded and the\r\nState government organized. Questions deeply interesting to Texas, in\r\ncommon with the other States, the extension of our revenue laws and\r\njudicial system over her people and territory, as well as measures of a\r\nlocal character, will claim the early attention of Congress, and therefore\r\nupon every principle of republican government she ought to be represented\r\nin that body without unnecessary delay. I can not too earnestly recommend\r\nprompt action on this important subject. As soon as the act to admit Texas\r\nas a State shall be passed the union of the two Republics will be\r\nconsummated by their own voluntary consent.\r\n\r\nThis accession to our territory has been a bloodless achievement. No arm of\r\nforce has been raised to produce the result. The sword has had no part in\r\nthe victory. We have not sought to extend our territorial possessions by\r\nconquest, or our republican institutions over a reluctant people. It was\r\nthe deliberate homage of each people to the great principle of our\r\nfederative union. If we consider the extent of territory involved in the\r\nannexation, its prospective influence on America, the means by which it has\r\nbeen accomplished, springing purely from the choice of the people\r\nthemselves to share the blessings of our union, the history of the world\r\nmay be challenged to furnish a parallel. The jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates, which at the formation of the Federal Constitution was bounded by\r\nthe St. Marys on the Atlantic, has passed the capes of Florida and been\r\npeacefully extended to the Del Norte. In contemplating the grandeur of this\r\nevent it is not to be forgotten that the result was achieved in despite of\r\nthe diplomatic interference of European monarchies. Even France, the\r\ncountry which had been our ancient ally, the country which has a common\r\ninterest with us in maintaining the freedom of the seas, the country which,\r\nby the cession of Louisiana, first opened to us access to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, the country with which we have been every year drawing more and\r\nmore closely the bonds of successful commerce, most unexpectedly, and to\r\nour unfeigned regret, took part in an effort to prevent annexation and to\r\nimpose on Texas, as a condition of the recognition of her independence by\r\nMexico, that she would never join herself to the United States. We may\r\nrejoice that the tranquil and pervading influence of the American principle\r\nof self-government was sufficient to defeat the purposes of British and\r\nFrench interference, and that the almost unanimous voice of the people of\r\nTexas has given to that interference a peaceful and effective rebuke. From\r\nthis example European Governments may learn how vain diplomatic arts and\r\nintrigues must ever prove upon this continent against that system of\r\nself-government which seems natural to our soil, and which will ever resist\r\nforeign interference.\r\n\r\nToward Texas I do not doubt that a liberal and generous spirit will actuate\r\nCongress in all that concerns her interests and prosperity, and that she\r\nwill never have cause to regret that she has united her \"lone star\" to our\r\nglorious constellation.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that our relations with Mexico since your last\r\nsession have not been of the amicable character which it is our desire to\r\ncultivate with all foreign nations. On the 6th day of March last the\r\nMexican envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United\r\nStates made a formal protest in the name of his Government against the\r\njoint resolution passed by Congress \"for the annexation of Texas to the\r\nUnited States,\" which he chose to regard as a violation of the rights of\r\nMexico, and in consequence of it he demanded his passports. He was informed\r\nthat the Government of the United States did not consider this joint\r\nresolution as a violation of any of the rights of Mexico, or that it\r\nafforded any just cause of offense to his Government; that the Republic of\r\nTexas was an independent power, owing no allegiance to Mexico and\r\nconstituting no part of her territory or rightful sovereignty and\r\njurisdiction. He was also assured that it was the sincere desire of this\r\nGovernment to maintain with that of Mexico relations of peace and good\r\nunderstanding. That functionary, however, notwithstanding these\r\nrepresentations and assurances, abruptly terminated his mission and shortly\r\nafterwards left the country. Our envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary to Mexico was refused all official intercourse with that\r\nGovernment, and, after remaining several months, by the permission of his\r\nown Government he returned to the United States. Thus, by the acts of\r\nMexico, all diplomatic intercourse between the two countries was\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nSince that time Mexico has until recently occupied an attitude of hostility\r\ntoward the United States--has been marshaling and organizing armies,\r\nissuing proclamations, and avowing the intention to make war on the United\r\nStates, either by an open declaration or by invading Texas. Both the\r\nCongress and convention of the people of Texas invited this Government to\r\nsend an army into that territory to protect and defend them against the\r\nmenaced attack. The moment the terms of annexation offered by the United\r\nStates were accepted by Texas the latter became so far a part of our own\r\ncountry as to make it our duty to afford such protection and defense. I\r\ntherefore deemed it proper, as a precautionary measure, to order a strong\r\nsquadron to the coasts of Mexico and to concentrate an efficient military\r\nforce on the western frontier of Texas. Our Army was ordered to take\r\nposition in the country between the Nueces and the Del Norte, and to repel\r\nany invasion of the Texan territory which might be attempted by the Mexican\r\nforces. Our squadron in the Gulf was ordered to cooperate with the Army.\r\nBut though our Army and Navy were placed in a position to defend our own\r\nand the rights of Texas, they were ordered to commit no act of hostility\r\nagainst Mexico unless she declared war or was herself the aggressor by\r\nstriking the first blow. The result has been that Mexico has made no\r\naggressive movement, and our military and naval commanders have executed\r\ntheir orders with such discretion that the peace of the two Republics has\r\nnot been disturbed. Texas had declared her independence and maintained it\r\nby her arms for more than nine years. She has had an organized government\r\nin successful operation during that period. Her separate existence as an\r\nindependent state had been recognized by the United States and the\r\nprincipal powers of Europe. Treaties of commerce and navigation had been\r\nconcluded with her by different nations, and it had become manifest to the\r\nwhole world that any further attempt on the part of Mexico to conquer her\r\nor overthrow her Government would be vain. Even Mexico herself had become\r\nsatisfied of this fact, and whilst the question of annexation was pending\r\nbefore the people of Texas during the past summer the Government of Mexico,\r\nby a formal act, agreed to recognize the independence of Texas on condition\r\nthat she would not annex herself to any other power. The agreement to\r\nacknowledge the independence of Texas, whether with or without this\r\ncondition, is conclusive against Mexico. The independence of Texas is a\r\nfact conceded by Mexico herself, and she had no right or authority to\r\nprescribe restrictions as to the form of government which Texas might\r\nafterwards choose to assume. But though Mexico can not complain of the\r\nUnited States on account of the annexation of Texas, it is to be regretted\r\nthat serious causes of misunderstanding between the two countries continue\r\nto exist, growing out of unredressed injuries inflicted by the Mexican\r\nauthorities and people on the persons and property of citizens of the\r\nUnited States through a long series of years. Mexico has admitted these\r\ninjuries, but has neglected and refused to repair them. Such was the\r\ncharacter of the wrongs and such the insults repeatedly offered to American\r\ncitizens and the American flag by Mexico, in palpable violation of the laws\r\nof nations and the treaty between the two countries of the 5th of April,\r\n1831, that they have been repeatedly brought to the notice of Congress by\r\nmy predecessors. As early as the 6th of February, 1837, the President of\r\nthe United States declared in a message to Congress that--\r\n\r\nThe length of time since some of the injuries have been committed, the\r\nrepeated and unavailing applications for redress, the wanton character of\r\nsome of the outrages upon the property and persons of our citizens, upon\r\nthe officers and flag of the United States, independent of recent insults\r\nto this Government and people by the late extraordinary Mexican minister,\r\nwould justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, recommend an immediate resort to this extreme measure,\r\nwhich, he declared, \"should not be used by just and generous nations,\r\nconfiding in their strength for injuries committed, if it can be honorably\r\navoided,\" but, in a spirit of forbearance, proposed that another demand be\r\nmade on Mexico for that redress which had been so long and unjustly\r\nwithheld. In these views committees of the two Houses of Congress, in\r\nreports made to their respective bodies, concurred. Since these proceedings\r\nmore than eight years have elapsed, during which, in addition to the wrongs\r\nthen complained of, others of an aggravated character have been committed\r\non the persons and property of our citizens. A special agent was sent to\r\nMexico in the summer of 1838 with full authority to make another and final\r\ndemand for redress. The demand was made; the Mexican Government promised to\r\nrepair the wrongs of which we complained, and after much delay a treaty of\r\nindemnity with that view was concluded between the two powers on the 11th\r\nof April, 1839, and was duly ratified by both Governments. By this treaty a\r\njoint commission was created to adjudicate and decide on the claims of\r\nAmerican citizens on the Government of Mexico. The commission was organized\r\nat Washington on the 25th day of August, 1840. Their time was limited to\r\neighteen months, at the expiration of which they had adjudicated and\r\ndecided claims amounting to $2,026,139.68 in favor of citizens of the\r\nUnited States against the Mexican Government, leaving a large amount of\r\nclaims undecided. Of the latter the American commissioners had decided in\r\nfavor of our citizens claims amounting to $928,627.88, which were left\r\nunacted on by the umpire authorized by the treaty. Still further claims,\r\namounting to between three and four millions of dollars, were submitted to\r\nthe board too late to be considered, and were left undisposed of. The sum\r\nof $2,026,139.68, decided by the board, was a liquidated and ascertained\r\ndebt due by Mexico to the claimants, and there was no justifiable reason\r\nfor delaying its payment according to the terms of the treaty. It was not,\r\nhowever, paid. Mexico applied for further indulgence, and, in that spirit\r\nof liberality and forbearance which has ever marked the policy of the\r\nUnited States toward that Republic, the request was granted, and on the\r\n30th of January, 1843, a new treaty was concluded. By this treaty it was\r\nprovided that the interest due on the awards in favor of claimants under\r\nthe convention of the 11th of April, 1839, should be paid out the 30th of\r\nApril, 1843, and that--\r\n\r\nThe principal of the said awards and the interest accruing thereon shall be\r\npaid in five years, in equal installments every three months, the said term\r\nof five years to commence on the 30th day of April, 1843, aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe interest due on the 30th day of April, 1843, and the three first of the\r\ntwenty installments have been paid. Seventeen of these installments, remain\r\nunpaid, seven of which are now due.\r\n\r\nThe claims which were left undecided by the joint commission, amounting to\r\nmore than $3,000,000, together with other claims for spoliations on the\r\nproperty of our citizens, were subsequently presented to the Mexican\r\nGovernment for payment, and were so far recognized that a treaty providing\r\nfor their examination and settlement by a joint commission was concluded\r\nand signed at Mexico on the 20th day of November, 1843. This treaty was\r\nratified by the United States with certain amendments to which no just\r\nexception could have been taken, but it has not yet received the\r\nratification of the Mexican Government. In the meantime our citizens, who\r\nsuffered great losses--and some of whom have been reduced from affluence to\r\nbankruptcy--are without remedy unless their rights be enforced by their\r\nGovernment. Such a continued and unprovoked series of wrongs could never\r\nhave been tolerated by the United States had they been committed by one of\r\nthe principal nations of Europe. Mexico was, however, a neighboring sister\r\nrepublic, which, following our example, had achieved her independence, and\r\nfor whose success and prosperity all our sympathies were early enlisted.\r\nThe United States were the first to recognize her independence and to\r\nreceive her into the family of nations, and have ever been desirous of\r\ncultivating with her a good understanding. We have therefore borne the\r\nrepeated wrongs she has committed with great patience, in the hope that a\r\nreturning sense of justice would ultimately guide her councils and that we\r\nmight, if possible, honorably avoid any hostile collision with her. Without\r\nthe previous authority of Congress the Executive possessed no power to\r\nadopt or enforce adequate remedies for the injuries we had suffered, or to\r\ndo more than to be prepared to repel the threatened aggression on the part\r\nof Mexico. After our Army and Navy had remained on the frontier and coasts\r\nof Mexico for many weeks without any hostile movement on her part, though\r\nher menaces were continued, I deemed it important to put an end, if\r\npossible, to this state of things. With this view I caused steps to be\r\ntaken in the month of September last to ascertain distinctly and in an\r\nauthentic form what the designs of the Mexican Government were--whether it\r\nwas their intention to declare war, or invade Texas, or whether they were\r\ndisposed to adjust and settle in an amicable manner the pending differences\r\nbetween the two countries. On the 9th of November an official answer was\r\nreceived that the Mexican Government consented to renew the diplomatic\r\nrelations which had been suspended in March last, and for that purpose were\r\nwilling to accredit a minister from the United States. With a sincere\r\ndesire to preserve peace and restore relations of good understanding\r\nbetween the two Republics, I waived all ceremony as to the manner of\r\nrenewing diplomatic intercourse between them, and, assuming the initiative,\r\non the 10th of November a distinguished citizen of Louisiana was appointed\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Mexico, clothed with\r\nfull powers to adjust and definitively settle all pending differences\r\nbetween the two countries, including those of boundary between Mexico and\r\nthe State of Texas. The minister appointed has set out on his mission and\r\nis probably by this time near the Mexican capital. He has been instructed\r\nto bring the negotiation with which he is charged to a conclusion at the\r\nearliest practicable period, which it is expected will be in time to enable\r\nme to communicate the result to Congress during the present session. Until\r\nthat result is known I forbear to recommend to Congress such ulterior\r\nmeasures of redress for the wrongs and injuries we have so long borne as it\r\nwould have been proper to make had no such negotiation been instituted.\r\n\r\nCongress appropriated at the last session the sum of $275,000 for the\r\npayment of the April and July installments of the Mexican indemnities for\r\nthe year 1844:\r\n\r\nProvided it shall be ascertained to the satisfaction of the American\r\nGovernment that said installments have been paid by the Mexican Government\r\nto the agent appointed by the United States to receive the same in such\r\nmanner as to discharge all claim on the Mexican Government, and said agent\r\nto be delinquent in remitting the money to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled state of our relations with Mexico has involved this subject\r\nin much mystery. The first information in an authentic form from the agent\r\nof the United States, appointed under the Administration of my predecessor,\r\nwas received at the State Department on the 9th of November last. This is\r\ncontained in a letter, dated the 17th of October, addressed by him to one\r\nof our citizens then in Mexico with a view of having it communicated to\r\nthat Department. From this it appears that the agent on the 20th of\r\nSeptember, 1844, gave a receipt to the treasury of Mexico for the amount of\r\nthe April and July installments of the indemnity. In the same\r\ncommunication, however, he asserts that he had not received a single dollar\r\nin cash, but that he holds such securities as warranted him at the time in\r\ngiving the receipt, and entertains no doubt but that he will eventually\r\nobtain the money. As these installments appear never to have been actually\r\npaid by the Government of Mexico to the agent, and as that Government has\r\nnot, therefore, been released so as to discharge the claim, I do not feel\r\nmyself warranted in directing payment to be made to the claimants out of\r\nthe Treasury without further legislation. Their case is undoubtedly one of\r\nmuch hardship, and it remains for Congress to decide whether any, and what,\r\nrelief ought to be granted to them. Our minister to Mexico has been\r\ninstructed to ascertain the facts of the case from the Mexican Government\r\nin an authentic and official form and report the result with as little\r\ndelay as possible.\r\n\r\nMy attention was early directed to the negotiation which on the 4th of\r\nMarch last I found pending at Washington between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain on the subject of the Oregon Territory. Three several\r\nattempts had been previously made to settle the questions in dispute\r\nbetween the two countries by negotiation upon the principle of compromise,\r\nbut each had proved unsuccessful. These negotiations took place at London\r\nin the years 1818, 1824, and 1826--the two first under the Administration\r\nof Mr. Monroe and the last under that of Mr. Adams. The negotiation of\r\n1818, having failed to accomplish its object, resulted in the convention of\r\nthe 20th of October of that year.\r\n\r\nBy the third article of that convention it was--\r\n\r\nAgreed that any country that may be claimed by either party on the\r\nnorthwest coast of America westward of the Stony Mountains shall, together\r\nwith its harbors, bays, and creeks, and the navigation of all rivers within\r\nthe same, be free and open for the term of ten years from the date of the\r\nsignature of the present convention to the vessels, citizens, and subjects\r\nof the two powers; it being well understood that this agreement is not to\r\nbe construed to the prejudice of any claim which either of the two high\r\ncontracting parties may have to any part of the said country, nor shall it\r\nbe taken to affect the claims of any other power or state to any part of\r\nthe said country, the only object of the high contracting parties in that\r\nrespect being to prevent disputes and differences amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of 1824 was productive of no result, and the convention of\r\n1818 was left unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of 1826, having also failed to effect an adjustment by\r\ncompromise, resulted in the convention of August 6, 1827, by which it was\r\nagreed to continue in force for an indefinite period the provisions of the\r\nthird article of the convention of the 20th of October, 1818; and it was\r\nfurther provided that--\r\n\r\nIt shall be competent, however, to either of the contracting parties, in\r\ncase either should think fit, at any time after the 20th of October, 1828,\r\non giving due notice of twelve months to the other contracting party, to\r\nannul and abrogate this convention; and it shall in such case be\r\naccordingly entirely annulled and abrogated after the expiration of the\r\nsaid term of notice.\r\n\r\nIn these attempts to adjust the controversy the parallel of the forty-ninth\r\ndegree of north latitude had been offered by the United States to Great\r\nBritain, and in those of 1818 and 1826, with a further concession of the\r\nfree navigation of the Columbia River south of that latitude. The parallel\r\nof the forty-ninth degree from the Rocky Mountains to its intersection with\r\nthe northeasternmost branch of the Columbia, and thence down the channel of\r\nthat river to the sea, had been offered by Great Britain, with an addition\r\nof a small detached territory north of the Columbia. Each of these\r\npropositions had been rejected by the parties respectively. In October,\r\n1843, the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates in London was authorized to make a similar offer to those made in\r\n1818 and 1826. Thus stood the question when the negotiation was shortly\r\nafterwards transferred to Washington, and on the 23d of August, 1844, was\r\nformally opened under the direction of my immediate predecessor. Like all\r\nthe previous negotiations, it was based upon principles of \"compromise,\"\r\nand the avowed purpose of the parties was \"to treat of the respective\r\nclaims of the two countries to the Oregon Territory with the view to\r\nestablish a permanent boundary between them westward of the Rocky Mountains\r\nto the Pacific Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 26th of August, 1844, the British plenipotentiary\r\noffered to divide the Oregon Territory by the forty-ninth parallel of north\r\nlatitude from the Rocky Mountains to the point of its intersection with the\r\nnortheasternmost branch of the Columbia River, and thence down that river\r\nto the sea, leaving the free navigation of the river to be enjoyed in\r\ncommon by both parties, the country south of this line to belong to the\r\nUnited States and that north of it to Great Britain. At the same time he\r\nproposed in addition to yield to the United States a detached territory\r\nnorth of the Columbia extending along the Pacific and the Straits of Fuca\r\nfrom Bulfinchs Harbor, inclusive, to Hoods Canal, and to make free to the\r\nUnited States any port or ports south of latitude 49° which they might\r\ndesire, either on the mainland or on Quadra and Vancouvers Island. With the\r\nexception of the free ports, this was the same offer which had been made by\r\nthe British and rejected by the American Government in the negotiation of\r\n1826. This proposition was properly rejected by the American\r\nplenipotentiary on the day it was submitted. This was the only proposition\r\nof compromise offered by the British plenipotentiary. The proposition on\r\nthe part of Great Britain having been rejected, the British plenipotentiary\r\nrequested that a proposal should be made by the United States for \"an\r\nequitable adjustment of the question.\" When I came into office I found this\r\nto be the state of the negotiation. Though entertaining the settled\r\nconviction that the British pretensions of title could not be maintained to\r\nany portion of the Oregon Territory upon any principle of public law\r\nrecognized by nations, yet in deference to what had been done by my\r\npredecessors, and especially in consideration that propositions of\r\ncompromise had been thrice made by two preceding Administrations to adjust\r\nthe question on the parallel of 49°, and in two of them yielding to\r\nGreat Britain the free navigation of the Columbia, and that the pending\r\nnegotiation had been commenced on the basis of compromise, I deemed it to\r\nbe my duty not abruptly to break it off. In consideration, too, that under\r\nthe conventions of 1818 and 1827 the citizens and subjects of the two\r\npowers held a joint occupancy of the country, I was induced to make another\r\neffort to settle this long-pending controversy in the spirit of moderation\r\nwhich had given birth to the renewed discussion. A proposition was\r\naccordingly made, which was rejected by the British plenipotentiary, who,\r\nwithout submitting any other proposition, suffered the negotiation on his\r\npart to drop, expressing his trust that the United States would offer what\r\nhe saw fit to call \"some further proposal for the settlement of the Oregon\r\nquestion more consistent with fairness and equity and with the reasonable\r\nexpectations of the British Government.\" The proposition thus offered and\r\nrejected repeated the offer of the parallel of 49° of north latitude,\r\nwhich had been made by two preceding Administrations, but without proposing\r\nto surrender to Great Britain, as they had done, the free navigation of the\r\nColumbia River. The right of any foreign power to the free navigation of\r\nany of our rivers through the heart of our country was one which I was\r\nunwilling to concede. It also embraced a provision to make free to Great\r\nBritain any port or ports on the cap of Quadra and Vancouvers Island south\r\nof this parallel. Had this been a new question, coming under discussion for\r\nthe first time, this proposition would not have been made. The\r\nextraordinary and wholly inadmissible demands of the British Government and\r\nthe rejection of the proposition made in deference alone to what had been\r\ndone by my predecessors and the implied obligation which their acts seemed\r\nto impose afford satisfactory evidence that no compromise which the United\r\nStates ought to accept can be effected. With this conviction the\r\nproposition of compromise which had been made and rejected was by my\r\ndirection subsequently withdrawn and our title to the whole Oregon\r\nTerritory asserted, and, as is believed, maintained by irrefragable facts\r\nand arguments.\r\n\r\nThe civilized world will see in these proceedings a spirit of liberal\r\nconcession on the part of the United States, and this Government will be\r\nrelieved from all responsibility which may follow the failure to settle the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nAll attempts at compromise having failed, it becomes the duty of Congress\r\nto consider what measures it may be proper to adopt for the security and\r\nprotection of our citizens now inhabiting or who may hereafter inhabit\r\nOregon, and for the maintenance of our just title to that Territory. In\r\nadopting measures for this purpose care should be taken that nothing be\r\ndone to violate the stipulations of the convention of 1827, which is still\r\nin force. The faith of treaties, in their letter and spirit, has ever been,\r\nand, I trust, will ever be, scrupulously observed by the United States.\r\nUnder that convention a year's notice is required to be given by either\r\nparty to the other before the joint occupancy shall terminate and before\r\neither can rightfully assert or exercise exclusive jurisdiction over any\r\nportion of the territory. This notice it would, in my judgment, be proper\r\nto give, and I recommend that provision be made by law for giving it\r\naccordingly, and terminating in this manner the convention of the 6th of\r\nAugust, 1827.\r\n\r\nIt will become proper for Congress to determine what legislation they can\r\nin the meantime adopt without violating this convention. Beyond all\r\nquestion the protection of our laws and our jurisdiction, civil and\r\ncriminal, ought to be immediately extended over our citizens in Oregon.\r\nThey have had just cause to complain of our long neglect in this\r\nparticular, and have in consequence been compelled for their own security\r\nand protection to establish a provisional government for themselves. Strong\r\nin their allegiance and ardent in their attachment to the United States,\r\nthey have been thus cast upon their own resources. They are anxious that\r\nour laws should be extended over them, and I recommend that this be done by\r\nCongress with as little delay as possible in the full extent to which the\r\nBritish Parliament have proceeded in regard to British subjects in that\r\nTerritory by their act of July 2, 1821, \"for regulating the fur trade and\r\nestablishing a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain parts of\r\nNorth America.\" By this act Great Britain extended her laws and\r\njurisdiction, civil and criminal, over her subjects engaged in the fur\r\ntrade in that Territory. By it the courts of the Province of Upper Canada\r\nwere empowered to take cognizance of causes civil and criminal. Justices of\r\nthe peace and other judicial officers were authorized to be appointed in\r\nOregon with power to execute all process issuing from the courts of that\r\nProvince, and to \"sit and hold courts of record for the trial of criminal\r\noffenses and misdemeanors\" not made the subject of capital punishment, and\r\nalso of civil cases where the cause of action shall not \"exceed in value\r\nthe amount or sum of lbs. 200.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the date of this act of Parliament a grant was made from the\r\n\"British Crown\" to the Hudsons Bay Company of the exclusive trade with the\r\nIndian tribes in the Oregon Territory, subject to a reservation that it\r\nshall not operate to the exclusion \"of the subjects of any foreign states\r\nwho, under or by force of any convention for the time being between us and\r\nsuch foreign states, respectively, may be entitled to and shall be engaged\r\nin the said trade.\" It is much to be regretted that while under this act\r\nBritish subjects have enjoyed the protection of British laws and British\r\njudicial tribunals throughout the whole of Oregon, American citizens in the\r\nsame Territory have enjoyed no such protection from their Government. At\r\nthe same time, the result illustrates the character of our people and their\r\ninstitutions. In spite of this neglect they have multiplied, and their\r\nnumber is rapidly increasing in that Territory. They have made no appeal to\r\narms, but have peacefully fortified themselves in their new homes by the\r\nadoption of republican institutions for themselves, furnishing another\r\nexample of the truth that self-government is inherent in the American\r\nbreast and must prevail. It is due to them that they should be embraced and\r\nprotected by our laws. It is deemed important that our laws regulating\r\ntrade and intercourse with the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains\r\nshould be extended to such tribes as dwell beyond them. The increasing\r\nemigration to Oregon and the care and protection which is due from the\r\nGovernment to its citizens in that distant region make it our duty, as it\r\nis our interest, to cultivate amicable relations with the Indian tribes of\r\nthat Territory. For this purpose I recommend that provision be made for\r\nestablishing an Indian agency and such subagencies as may be deemed\r\nnecessary beyond the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of emigrants whilst on their way to Oregon against the\r\nattacks of the Indian tribes occupying the country through which they pass,\r\nI recommend that a suitable number of stockades and blockhouse forts be\r\nerected along the usual route between our frontier settlements on the\r\nMissouri and the Rocky Mountains, and that an adequate force of mounted\r\nriflemen be raised to guard and protect them on their journey. The\r\nimmediate adoption of these recommendations by Congress will not violate\r\nthe provisions of the existing treaty. It will be doing nothing more for\r\nAmerican citizens than British laws have long since done for British\r\nsubjects in the same territory.\r\n\r\nIt requires several months to perform the voyage by sea from the Atlantic\r\nStates to Oregon, and although we have a large number of whale ships in the\r\nPacific, but few of them afford an opportunity of interchanging\r\nintelligence without great delay between our settlements in that distant\r\nregion and the United States. An overland mail is believed to be entirely\r\npracticable, and the importance of establishing such a mail at least once a\r\nmonth is submitted to the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted to the wisdom of Congress to determine whether at their\r\npresent session, and until after the expiration of the year's notice, any\r\nother measures may be adopted consistently with the convention of 1827 for\r\nthe security of our rights and the government and protection of our\r\ncitizens in Oregon. That it will ultimately be wise and proper to make\r\nliberal grants of land to the patriotic pioneers who amidst privations and\r\ndangers lead the way through savage tribes inhabiting the vast wilderness\r\nintervening between our frontier settlements and Oregon, and who cultivate\r\nand are ever ready to defend the soil, I am fully satisfied. To doubt\r\nwhether they will obtain such grants as soon as the convention between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain shall have ceased to exist would be to\r\ndoubt the justice of Congress; but, pending the year's notice, it is worthy\r\nof consideration whether a stipulation to this effect may be made\r\nconsistently with the spirit of that convention.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations which I have made as to the best manner of securing our\r\nrights in Oregon are submitted to Congress with great deference. Should\r\nthey in their wisdom devise any other mode better calculated to accomplish\r\nthe same object, it shall meet with my hearty concurrence.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year's notice, should Congress think it proper to make\r\nprovision for giving that notice, we shall have reached a period when the\r\nnational rights in Oregon must either be abandoned or firmly maintained.\r\nThat they can not be abandoned without a sacrifice of both national honor\r\nand interest is too clear to admit of doubt.\r\n\r\nOregon is a part of the North American continent, to which, it is\r\nconfidently affirmed, the title of the United States is the best now in\r\nexistence. For the grounds on which that title rests I refer you to the\r\ncorrespondence of the late and present Secretary of State with the British\r\nplenipotentiary during the negotiation. The British proposition of\r\ncompromise, which would make the Columbia the line south of 49°, with a\r\ntrifling addition of detached territory to the United States north of that\r\nriver, and would leave on the British side two-thirds of the whole Oregon\r\nTerritory, including the free navigation of the Columbia and all the\r\nvaluable harbors on the Pacific, can never for a moment be entertained by\r\nthe United States without an abandonment of their just and dear territorial\r\nrights, their own self-respect, and the national honor. For the information\r\nof Congress, I communicate herewith the correspondence which took place\r\nbetween the two Governments during the late negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe rapid extension of our settlements over our territories heretofore\r\nunoccupied, the addition of new States to our Confederacy, the expansion of\r\nfree principles, and our rising greatness as a nation are attracting the\r\nattention of the powers of Europe, and lately the doctrine has been\r\nbroached in some of them of a \"balance of power\" on this continent to check\r\nour advancement. The United States, sincerely desirous of preserving\r\nrelations of good understanding with all nations, can not in silence permit\r\nany European interference on the North American continent, and should any\r\nsuch interference be attempted will be ready to resist it at any and all\r\nhazards.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to the American people and to all nations that this\r\nGovernment has never interfered with the relations subsisting between other\r\ngovernments. We have never made ourselves parties to their wars or their\r\nalliances; we have not sought their territories by conquest; we have not\r\nmingled with parties in their domestic struggles; and believing our own\r\nform of government to be the best, we have never attempted to propagate it\r\nby intrigues, by diplomacy, or by force. We may claim on this continent a\r\nlike exemption from European interference. The nations of America are\r\nequally sovereign and independent with those of Europe. They possess the\r\nsame rights, independent of all foreign interposition, to make war, to\r\nconclude peace, and to regulate their internal affairs. The people of the\r\nUnited States can not, therefore, view with indifference attempts of\r\nEuropean powers to interfere with the independent action of the nations on\r\nthis continent. The American system of government is entirely different\r\nfrom that of Europe. Jealousy among the different sovereigns of Europe,\r\nlest any one of them might become too powerful for the rest, has caused\r\nthem anxiously to desire the establishment of what they term the \"balance\r\nof power.\" It can not be permitted to have any application on the North\r\nAmerican continent, and especially to the United States. We must ever\r\nmaintain the principle that the people of this continent alone have the\r\nright to decide their own destiny. Should any portion of them, constituting\r\nan independent state, propose to unite themselves with our Confederacy,\r\nthis will be a question for them and us to determine without any foreign\r\ninterposition. We can never consent that European powers shall interfere to\r\nprevent such a union because it might disturb the \"balance of power\" which\r\nthey may desire to maintain upon this continent. Near a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago the principle was distinctly announced to the world, in the\r\nannual message of one of my predecessors, that--\r\n\r\nThe American continents, by the free and independent condition which they\r\nhave assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects\r\nfor colonization by any European powers.\r\n\r\nThis principle will apply with greatly increased force should any European\r\npower attempt to establish any new colony in North America. In the existing\r\ncircumstances of the world the present is deemed a proper occasion to\r\nreiterate and reaffirm the principle avowed by Mr. Monroe and to state my\r\ncordial concurrence in its wisdom and sound policy. The reassertion of this\r\nprinciple, especially in reference to North America, is at this day but the\r\npromulgation of a policy which no European power should cherish the\r\ndisposition to resist. Existing rights of every European nation should be\r\nrespected, but it is due alike to our safety and our interests that the\r\nefficient protection of our laws should be extended over our whole\r\nterritorial limits, and that it should be distinctly announced to the world\r\nas our settled policy that no future European colony or dominion shall with\r\nour consent be planted or established on any part of the North American\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nA question has recently arisen under the tenth article of the subsisting\r\ntreaty between the United States and Prussia. By this article the consuls\r\nof the two countries have the right to sit as judges and arbitrators \"in\r\nsuch differences as may arise between the captains and crews of the vessels\r\nbelonging to the nation whose interests are committed to their charge\r\nwithout the interference of the local authorities, unless the conduct of\r\nthe crews or of the captain should disturb the order or tranquillity of the\r\ncountry, or the said consuls should require their assistance to cause their\r\ndecisions to be carried into effect or supported.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prussian consul at New Bedford in June, 1844, applied to Mr. Justice\r\nStory to carry into effect a decision made by him between the captain and\r\ncrew of the Prussian ship Borussia, but the request was refused on the\r\nground that without previous legislation by Congress the judiciary did not\r\npossess the power to give effect to this article of the treaty. The\r\nPrussian Government, through their minister here, have complained of this\r\nviolation of the treaty, and have asked the Government of the United States\r\nto adopt the necessary measures to prevent similar violations hereafter.\r\nGood faith to Prussia, as well as to other nations with whom we have\r\nsimilar treaty stipulations, requires that these should be faithfully\r\nobserved. I have deemed it proper, therefore, to lay the subject before\r\nCongress and to recommend such legislation as may be necessary to give\r\neffect to these treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of an arrangement made between the Spanish Government and that of\r\nthe United States in December, 1831, American vessels, since the 29th of\r\nApril, 1832, have been admitted to entry in the ports of Spain, including\r\nthose of the Balearic and Canary islands, on payment of the same tonnage\r\nduty of 5 cents per ton, as though they had been Spanish vessels; and this\r\nwhether our vessels arrive in Spain directly from the United States or\r\nindirectly from any other country. When Congress, by the act of 13th July,\r\n1832, gave effect to this arrangement between the two Governments, they\r\nconfined the reduction of tonnage duty merely to Spanish vessels \"coming\r\nfrom a port in Spain,\" leaving the former discriminating duty to remain\r\nagainst such vessels coming from a port in any other country. It is\r\nmanifestly unjust that whilst American vessels arriving in the ports of\r\nSpain from other countries pay no more duty than Spanish vessels, Spanish\r\nvessels arriving in the ports of the United States from other countries\r\nshould be subjected to heavy discriminating tonnage duties. This is neither\r\nequality nor reciprocity, and is in violation of the arrangement concluded\r\nin December, 1831, between the two countries. The Spanish Government have\r\nmade repeated and earnest remonstrances against this inequality, and the\r\nfavorable attention of Congress has been several times invoked to the\r\nsubject by my predecessors. I recommend, as an act of justice to Spain,\r\nthat this inequality be removed by Congress and that the discriminating\r\nduties which have been levied under the act of the 13th of July, 1832, on\r\nSpanish vessels coming to the United States from any other foreign country\r\nbe refunded. This recommendation does not embrace Spanish vessels arriving\r\nin the United States from Cuba and Porto Rico, which will still remain\r\nsubject to the provisions of the act of June 30, 1834, concerning tonnage\r\nduty on such vessels. By the act of the 14th of July, 1832, coffee was\r\nexempted from duty altogether. This exemption was universal, without\r\nreference to the country where it was produced or the national character of\r\nthe vessel in which it was imported. By the tariff act of the 30th of\r\nAugust, 1842, this exemption from duty was restricted to coffee imported in\r\nAmerican vessels from the place of its production, whilst coffee imported\r\nunder all other circumstances was subjected to a duty of 20 per cent ad\r\nvalorem. Under this act and our existing treaty with the King of the\r\nNetherlands Java coffee imported from the European ports of that Kingdom\r\ninto the United States, whether in Dutch or American vessels, now pays this\r\nrate of duty. The Government of the Netherlands complains that such a\r\ndiscriminating duty should have been imposed on coffee the production of\r\none of its colonies, and which is chiefly brought from Java to the ports of\r\nthat Kingdom and exported from thence to foreign countries. Our trade with\r\nthe Netherlands is highly beneficial to both countries and our relations\r\nwith them have ever been of the most friendly character. Under all the\r\ncircumstances of the case, I recommend that this discrimination should be\r\nabolished and that the coffee of Java imported from the Netherlands be\r\nplaced upon the same footing with that imported directly from Brazil and\r\nother countries where it is produced.\r\n\r\nUnder the eighth section of the tariff act of the 30th of August, 1842, a\r\nduty of 15 cents per gallon was imposed on port wine in casks, while on the\r\nred wines of several other countries, when imported in casks, a duty of\r\nonly 6 cents per gallon was imposed. This discrimination, so far as\r\nregarded the port wine of Portugal, was deemed a violation of our treaty\r\nwith that power, which provides that--\r\n\r\nNo higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the\r\nUnited States of America of any article the growth, produce, or manufacture\r\nof the Kingdom and possessions of Portugal than such as are or shall be\r\npayable on the like article being the growth, produce, or manufacture of\r\nany other foreign country.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, to give effect to the treaty as well as to the intention of\r\nCongress, expressed in a proviso to the tariff act itself, that nothing\r\ntherein contained should be so construed as to interfere with subsisting\r\ntreaties with foreign nations, a Treasury circular was issued on the 16th\r\nof July, 1844, which, among other things, declared the duty on the port\r\nwine of Portugal, in casks, under the existing laws and treaty to be 6\r\ncents per gallon, and directed that the excess of duties which had been\r\ncollected on such wine should be refunded. By virtue of another clause in\r\nthe same section of the act it is provided that all imitations of port or\r\nany other wines \"shall be subject to the duty provided for the genuine\r\narticle.\" Imitations of port wine, the production of France, are imported\r\nto some extent into the United States, and the Government of that country\r\nnow claims that under a correct construction of the act these imitations\r\nought not to pay a higher duty than that imposed upon the original port\r\nwine of Portugal. It appears to me to be unequal and unjust that French\r\nimitations of port wine should be subjected to a duty of 15 cents, while\r\nthe more valuable article from Portugal should pay a duty of 6 cents only\r\nper gallon. I therefore recommend to Congress such legislation as may be\r\nnecessary to correct the inequality.\r\n\r\nThe late President, in his annual message of December last, recommended an\r\nappropriation to satisfy the claims of the Texan Government against the\r\nUnited States, which had been previously adjusted so far as the powers of\r\nthe Executive extend. These claims arose out of the act of disarming a body\r\nof Texan troops under the command of Major Snively by an officer in the\r\nservice of the United States, acting under the orders of our Government,\r\nand the forcible entry into the custom-house at Bryarlys Landing, on Red\r\nRiver, by certain citizens of the United States and taking away therefrom\r\nthe goods seized by the collector of the customs as forfeited under the\r\nlaws of Texas. This was a liquidated debt ascertained to be due to Texas\r\nwhen an independent state. Her acceptance of the terms of annexation\r\nproposed by the United States does not discharge or invalidate the claim. I\r\nrecommend that provision be made for its payment.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner appointed to China during the special session of the\r\nSenate in March last shortly afterwards set out on his mission in the\r\nUnited States ship Columbus. On arriving at Rio de Janeiro on his passage\r\nthe state of his health had become so critical that by the advice of his\r\nmedical attendants he returned to the United States early in the month of\r\nOctober last. Commodore Biddle, commanding the East India Squadron,\r\nproceeded on his voyage in the Columbus, and was charged by the\r\ncommissioner with the duty of exchanging with the proper authorities the\r\nratifications of the treaty lately concluded with the Emperor of China.\r\nSince the return of the commissioner to the United States his health has\r\nbeen much improved, and he entertains the confident belief that he will\r\nsoon be able to proceed on his mission.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, differences continue to exist among some of the nations of\r\nSouth America which, following our example, have established their\r\nindependence, while in others internal dissensions prevail. It is natural\r\nthat our sympathies should be warmly enlisted for their welfare; that we\r\nshould desire that all controversies between them should be amicably\r\nadjusted and their Governments administered in a manner to protect the\r\nrights and promote the prosperity of their people. It is contrary, however,\r\nto our settled policy to interfere in their controversies, whether external\r\nor internal.\r\n\r\nI have thus adverted to all the subjects connected with our foreign\r\nrelations to which I deem it necessary to call your attention. Our policy\r\nis not only peace with all, but good will toward all the powers of the\r\nearth. While we are just to all, we require that all shall be just to us.\r\nExcepting the differences with Mexico and Great Britain, our relations with\r\nall civilized nations are of the most satisfactory character. It is hoped\r\nthat in this enlightened age these differences may be amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report to Congress will\r\ncommunicate a full statement of the condition of our finances. The imports\r\nfor the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were of the value of\r\n$117,254,564, of which the amount exported was $15,346,830, leaving a\r\nbalance of $101,907,734 for domestic consumption. The exports for the same\r\nyear were of the value of $114,646,606, of which the amount of domestic\r\narticles was $99,299,776. The receipts into the Treasury during the same\r\nyear were $29,769,133.56, of which there were derived from customs\r\n$27,528,122.70, from sales of public lands $2,077,022.30, and from\r\nincidental and miscellaneous sources $163,998.56. The expenditures for the\r\nsame period were $29,968,206.98, of which $8,588,157.62 were applied to the\r\npayment of the public debt. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July\r\nlast was $7,658,306.22. The amount of the public debt remaining unpaid on\r\nthe 1st of October last was $17,075,445.52. Further payments of the public\r\ndebt would have been made, in anticipation of the period of its\r\nreimbursement under the authority conferred upon the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury by the acts of July 21, 1841, and of April 15, 1842, and March 3,\r\n1843, had not the unsettled state of our relations with Mexico menaced\r\nhostile collision with that power. In view of such a contingency it was\r\ndeemed prudent to retain in the Treasury an amount unusually large for\r\nordinary purposes.\r\n\r\nA few years ago our whole national debt growing out of the Revolution and\r\nthe War of 1812 with Great Britain was extinguished, and we presented to\r\nthe world the rare and noble spectacle of a great and growing people who\r\nhad fully discharged every obligation. Since that time the existing debt\r\nhas been contracted, and, small as it is in comparison with the similar\r\nburdens of most other nations, it should be extinguished at the earliest\r\npracticable period. Should the state of the country permit, and especially\r\nif our foreign relations interpose no obstacle, it is contemplated to apply\r\nall the moneys in the Treasury as they accrue, beyond what is required for\r\nthe appropriations by Congress, to its liquidation. I cherish the hope of\r\nsoon being able to congratulate the country on its recovering once more the\r\nlofty position which it so recently occupied. Our country, which exhibits\r\nto the world the benefits of self-government, in developing all the sources\r\nof national prosperity owes to mankind the permanent example of a nation\r\nfree from the blighting influence of a public debt.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is invited to the importance of making suitable\r\nmodifications and reductions of the rates of duty imposed by our present\r\ntariff laws. The object of imposing duties on imports should be to raise\r\nrevenue to pay the necessary expenses of Government. Congress may\r\nundoubtedly, in the exercise of a sound discretion, discriminate in\r\narranging the rates of duty on different articles, but the discriminations\r\nshould be within the revenue standard and be made with the view to raise\r\nmoney for the support of Government.\r\n\r\nIt becomes important to understand distinctly what is meant by a revenue\r\nstandard the maximum of which should not be exceeded in the rates of duty\r\nimposed. It is conceded, and experience proves, that duties may be laid so\r\nhigh as to diminish or prohibit altogether the importation of any given\r\narticle, and thereby lessen or destroy the revenue which at lower rates\r\nwould be derived from its importation. Such duties exceed the revenue rates\r\nand are not imposed to raise money for the support of Government. If\r\nCongress levy a duty for revenue of 1 per cent on a given article, it will\r\nproduce a given amount of money to the Treasury and will incidentally and\r\nnecessarily afford protection or advantage to the amount of 1 per cent to\r\nthe home manufacturer of a similar or like article over the importer. If\r\nthe duty be raised to 10 per cent, it will produce a greater amount of\r\nmoney and afford greater protection. If it be still raised to 20, 25, or 30\r\nper cent, and if as it is raised the revenue derived from it is found to be\r\nincreased, the protection or advantage will also be increased; but if it be\r\nraised to 31 per cent, and it is found that the revenue produced at that\r\nrate is less than at 30 per cent, it ceases to be a revenue duty. The\r\nprecise point in the ascending scale of duties at which it is ascertained\r\nfrom experience that the revenue is greatest is the maximum rate of duty\r\nwhich can be laid for the bona fide purpose of collecting money for the\r\nsupport of Government. To raise the duties higher than that point, and\r\nthereby diminish the amount collected, is to levy them for protection\r\nmerely, and not for revenue. As long, then, as Congress may gradually\r\nincrease the rate of duty on a given article, and the revenue is increased\r\nby such increase of duty, they are within the revenue standard. When they\r\ngo beyond that point, and as they increase the duties, the revenue is\r\ndiminished or destroyed; the act ceases to have for its object the raising\r\nof money to support Government, but is for protection merely. It does not\r\nfollow that Congress should levy the highest duty on all articles of import\r\nwhich they will bear within the revenue standard, for such rates would\r\nprobably produce a much larger amount than the economical administration of\r\nthe Government would require. Nor does it follow that the duties on all\r\narticles should be at the same or a horizontal rate. Some articles will\r\nbear a much higher revenue duty than others. Below the maximum of the\r\nrevenue standard Congress may and ought to discriminate in the rates\r\nimposed, taking care so to adjust them on different articles as to produce\r\nin the aggregate the amount which, when added to the proceeds of the sales\r\nof public lands, may be needed to pay the economical expenses of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn levying a tariff of duties Congress exercise the taxing power, and for\r\npurposes of revenue may select the objects of taxation. They may exempt\r\ncertain articles altogether and permit their importation free of duty. On\r\nothers they may impose low duties. In these classes should be embraced such\r\narticles of necessity as are in general use, and especially such as are\r\nconsumed by the laborer and poor as well as by the wealthy citizen. Care\r\nshould be taken that all the great interests of the country, including\r\nmanufactures, agriculture, commerce, navigation, and the mechanic arts,\r\nshould, as far as may be practicable, derive equal advantages from the\r\nincidental protection which a just system of revenue duties may afford.\r\nTaxation, direct or indirect, is a burden, and it should be so imposed as\r\nto operate as equally as may be on all classes in the proportion of their\r\nability to bear it. To make the taxing power an actual benefit to one class\r\nnecessarily increases the burden of the others beyond their proportion, and\r\nwould be manifestly unjust. The terms \"protection to domestic industry\" are\r\nof popular import, but they should apply under a just system to all the\r\nvarious branches of industry in our country. The farmer or planter who\r\ntoils yearly in his fields is engaged in \"domestic industry,\" and is as\r\nmuch entitled to have his labor \"protected\" as the manufacturer, the man of\r\ncommerce, the navigator, or the mechanic, who are engaged also in \"domestic\r\nindustry\" in their different pursuits. The joint labors of all these\r\nclasses constitute the aggregate of the \"domestic industry\" of the nation,\r\nand they are equally entitled to the nation's \"protection.\" No one of them\r\ncan justly claim to be the exclusive recipient of \"protection,\" which can\r\nonly be afforded by increasing burdens on the \"domestic industry\" of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIf these views be correct, it remains to inquire how far the tariff act of\r\n1842 is consistent with them. That many of the provisions of that act are\r\nin violation of the cardinal principles here laid down all must concede.\r\nThe rates of duty imposed by it on some articles are prohibitory and on\r\nothers so high as greatly to diminish importations and to produce a less\r\namount of revenue than would be derived from lower rates. They operate as\r\n\"protection merely\" to one branch of \"domestic industry\" by taxing other\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nBy the introduction of minimums, or assumed and false values, and by the\r\nimposition of specific duties the injustice and inequality of the act of\r\n1842 in its practical operations on different classes and pursuits are seen\r\nand felt. Many of the oppressive duties imposed by it under the operation\r\nof these principles range from 1 per cent to more than 200 per cent. They\r\nare prohibitory on some articles and partially so on others, and bear most\r\nheavily on articles of common necessity and but lightly on articles of\r\nluxury. It is so framed that much the greatest burden which it imposes is\r\nthrown on labor and the poorer classes, who are least able to bear it,\r\nwhile it protects capital and exempts the rich from paying their just\r\nproportion of the taxation required for the support of Government. While it\r\nprotects the capital of the wealthy manufacturer and increases his profits,\r\nit does not benefit the operatives or laborers in his employment, whose\r\nwages have not been increased by it. Articles of prime necessity or of\r\ncoarse quality and low price, used by the masses of the people, are in many\r\ninstances subjected by it to heavy taxes, while articles of finer quality\r\nand higher price, or of luxury, which can be used only by the opulent, are\r\nlightly taxed. It imposes heavy and unjust burdens on the farmer, the\r\nplanter, the commercial man, and those of all other pursuits except the\r\ncapitalist who has made his investments in manufactures. All the great\r\ninterests of the country are not as nearly as may be practicable equally\r\nprotected by it.\r\n\r\nThe Government in theory knows no distinction of persons or classes, and\r\nshould not bestow upon some favors and privileges which all others may not\r\nenjoy. It was the purpose of its illustrious founders to base the\r\ninstitutions which they reared upon the great and unchanging principles of\r\njustice and equity, conscious that if administered in the spirit in which\r\nthey were conceived they would be felt only by the benefits which they\r\ndiffused, and would secure for themselves a defense in the hearts of the\r\npeople more powerful than standing armies and all the means and appliances\r\ninvented to sustain governments founded in injustice and oppression.\r\n\r\nThe well-known fact that the tariff act of 1842 was passed by a majority of\r\none vote in the Senate and two in the House of Representatives, and that\r\nsome of those who felt themselves constrained, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances existing at the time, to vote in its favor, proclaimed its\r\ndefects and expressed their determination to aid in its modification on the\r\nfirst opportunity, affords strong and conclusive evidence that it was not\r\nintended to be permanent, and of the expediency and necessity of its\r\nthorough revision.\r\n\r\nIn recommending to Congress a reduction of the present rates of duty and a\r\nrevision and modification of the act of 1842, I am far from entertaining\r\nopinions unfriendly to the manufacturers. On the contrary, I desire to see\r\nthem prosperous as far as they can be so without imposing unequal burdens\r\non other interests. The advantage under any system of indirect taxation,\r\neven within the revenue standard, must be in favor of the manufacturing\r\ninterest, and of this no other interest will complain.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress the abolition of the minimum principle, or assumed,\r\narbitrary, and false values, and of specific duties, and the substitution\r\nin their place of ad valorem duties as the fairest and most equitable\r\nindirect tax which can be imposed. By the ad valorem principle all articles\r\nare taxed according to their cost or value, and those which are of inferior\r\nquality or of small cost bear only the just proportion of the tax with\r\nthose which are of superior quality or greater cost. The articles consumed\r\nby all are taxed at the same rate. A system of ad valorem revenue duties,\r\nwith proper discriminations and proper guards against frauds in collecting\r\nthem, it is not doubted will afford ample incidental advantages to the\r\nmanufacturers and enable them to derive as great profits as can be derived\r\nfrom any other regular business. It is believed that such a system strictly\r\nwithin the revenue standard will place the manufacturing interests on a\r\nstable footing and inure to their permanent advantage, while it will as\r\nnearly as may be practicable extend to all the great interests of the\r\ncountry the incidental protection which can be afforded by our revenue\r\nlaws. Such a system, when once firmly established, would be permanent, and\r\nnot be subject to the constant complaints, agitations, and changes which\r\nmust ever occur when duties are not laid for revenue, but for the\r\n\"protection merely\" of a favored interest.\r\n\r\nIn the deliberations of Congress on this subject it is hoped that a spirit\r\nof mutual concession and compromise between conflicting interests may\r\nprevail, and that the result of their labors may be crowned with the\r\nhappiest consequences.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of the United States it is provided that \"no money\r\nshall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made\r\nby law.\" A public treasury was undoubtedly contemplated and intended to be\r\ncreated, in which the public money should be kept from the period of\r\ncollection until needed for public uses. In the collection and disbursement\r\nof the public money no agencies have ever been employed by law except such\r\nas were appointed by the Government, directly responsible to it and under\r\nits control. The safe-keeping of the public money should be confided to a\r\npublic treasury created by law and under like responsibility and control.\r\nIt is not to be imagined that the framers of the Constitution could have\r\nintended that a treasury should be created as a place of deposit and\r\nsafe-keeping of the public money which was irresponsible to the Government.\r\nThe first Congress under the Constitution, by the act of the 2d of\r\nSeptember, 1789, \"to establish the Treasury Department,\" provided for the\r\nappointment of a Treasurer, and made it his duty \"to receive and keep the\r\nmoneys of the United States\" and \"at all times to submit to the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and the Comptroller, or either of them, the inspection of\r\nthe moneys in his hands.\"\r\n\r\nThat banks, national or State, could not have been intended to be used as a\r\nsubstitute for the Treasury spoken of in the Constitution as keepers of the\r\npublic money is manifest from the fact that at that time there was no\r\nnational bank, and but three or four State banks, of limited Capital,\r\nexisted in the country. Their employment as depositories was at first\r\nresorted to to a limited extent, but with no avowed intention of continuing\r\nthem permanently in place of the Treasury of the Constitution. When they\r\nwere afterwards from time to time employed, it was from motives of supposed\r\nconvenience. Our experience has shown that when banking corporations have\r\nbeen the keepers of the public money, and been thereby made in effect the\r\nTreasury, the Government can have no guaranty that it can command the use\r\nof its own money for public purposes. The late Bank of the United States\r\nproved to be faithless. The State banks which were afterwards employed were\r\nfaithless. But a few years ago, with millions of public money in their\r\nkeeping, the Government was brought almost to bankruptcy and the public\r\ncredit seriously impaired because of their inability or indisposition to\r\npay on demand to the public creditors in the only currency recognized by\r\nthe Constitution. Their failure occurred in a period of peace, and great\r\ninconvenience and loss were suffered by the public from it. Had the country\r\nbeen involved in a foreign war, that inconvenience and loss would have been\r\nmuch greater, and might have resulted in extreme public calamity. The\r\npublic money should not be mingled with the private funds of banks or\r\nindividuals or be used for private purposes. When it is placed in banks for\r\nsafe-keeping, it is in effect loaned to them without interest, and is\r\nloaned by them upon interest to the borrowers from them. The public money\r\nis converted into banking capital, and is used and loaned out for the\r\nprivate profit of bank stockholders, and when called for, as was the case\r\nin 1837, it may be in the pockets of the borrowers from the banks instead\r\nof being in the public Treasury contemplated by the Constitution. The\r\nframers of the Constitution could never have intended that the money paid\r\ninto the Treasury should be thus converted to private use and placed beyond\r\nthe control of the Government.\r\n\r\nBanks which hold the public money are often tempted by a desire of gain to\r\nextend their loans, increase their circulation, and thus stimulate, if not\r\nproduce, a spirit of speculation and extravagance which sooner or later\r\nmust result in ruin to thousands. If the public money be not permitted to\r\nbe thus used, but be kept in the Treasure and paid out to the public\r\ncreditors in gold and silver, the temptation afforded by its deposit with\r\nbanks to an undue expansion of their business would be checked, while the\r\namount of the constitutional currency left in circulation would be enlarged\r\nby its employment in the public collections and disbursements, and the\r\nbanks themselves would in consequence be found in a safer and sounder\r\ncondition. At present State banks are employed as depositories, but without\r\nadequate regulation of law whereby the public money can be secured against\r\nthe casualties and excesses, revulsions, suspensions, and defalcations to\r\nwhich from overissues, overtrading, an inordinate desire for gain, or other\r\ncauses they are constantly exposed. The Secretary of the Treasury has in\r\nall cases when it was practicable taken collateral security for the amount\r\nwhich they hold, by the pledge of stocks of the United States or such of\r\nthe States as were in good credit. Some of the deposit banks have given\r\nthis description of security and others have declined to do so.\r\n\r\nEntertaining the opinion that \"the separation of the moneys of the\r\nGovernment from banking institutions is indispensable for the safety of the\r\nfunds of the Government and the rights of the people,\" I recommend to\r\nCongress that provision be made by law for such separation, and that a\r\nconstitutional treasury be created for the safe-keeping of the public\r\nmoney. The constitutional treasury recommended is designed as a secure\r\ndepository for the public money, without any power to make loans or\r\ndiscounts or to issue any paper whatever as a currency or circulation. I\r\ncan not doubt that such a treasury as was contemplated by the Constitution\r\nshould be independent of all banking corporations. The money of the people\r\nshould be kept in the Treasury of the people created by law, and be in the\r\ncustody of agents of the people chosen by themselves according to the forms\r\nof the Constitution--agents who are directly responsible to the Government,\r\nwho are under adequate bonds and oaths, and who are subject to severe\r\npunishments for any embezzlement, private use, or misapplication of the\r\npublic funds, and for any failure in other respects to perform their\r\nduties. To say that the people or their Government are incompetent or not\r\nto be trusted with the custody of their own money in their own Treasury,\r\nprovided by themselves, but must rely on the presidents, cashiers, and\r\nstockholders of banking corporations, not appointed by them nor responsible\r\nto them, would be to concede that they are incompetent for\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nIn recommending the establishment of a constitutional treasury in which the\r\npublic money shall be kept, I desire that adequate provision be made by law\r\nfor its safety and that all Executive discretion or control over it shall\r\nbe removed, except such as may be necessary in directing its disbursement\r\nin pursuance of appropriations made by law.\r\n\r\nUnder our present land system, limiting the minimum price at which the\r\npublic lands can be entered to $1.25 per acre, large quantities of lands of\r\ninferior quality remain unsold because they will not command that price.\r\nFrom the records of the General Land Office it appears that of the public\r\nlands remaining unsold in the several States and Territories in which they\r\nare situated, 39,105,577 acres have been in the market subject to entry\r\nmore than twenty years, 49,638,644 acres for more than fifteen years,\r\n73,074,600 acres for more than ten years, and 106,176,961 acres for more\r\nthan five years. Much the largest portion of these lands will continue to\r\nbe unsalable at the minimum price at which they are permitted to be sold so\r\nlong as large territories of lands from which the more valuable portions\r\nhave not been selected are annually brought into market by the Government.\r\nWith the view to the sale and settlement of these inferior lands, I\r\nrecommend that the price be graduated and reduced below the present minimum\r\nrate, confining the sales at the reduced prices to settlers and\r\ncultivators, in limited quantities. If graduated and reduced in price for a\r\nlimited term to $1 per acre, and after the expiration of that period for a\r\nsecond and third term to lower rates, a large portion of these lands would\r\nbe purchased, and many worthy citizens who are unable to pay higher rates\r\ncould purchase homes for themselves and their families. By adopting the\r\npolicy of graduation and reduction of price these inferior lands will be\r\nsold for their real value, while the States in which they lie will be freed\r\nfrom the inconvenience, if not injustice, to which they are subjected in\r\nconsequence of the United States continuing to own large quantities of the\r\npublic lands within their borders not liable to taxation for the support of\r\ntheir local governments.\r\n\r\nI recommend the continuance of the policy of granting preemptions in its\r\nmost liberal extent to all those who have settled or may hereafter settle\r\non the public lands, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, to which the Indian\r\ntitle may have been extinguished at the time of settlement. It has been\r\nfound by experience that in consequence of combinations of purchasers and\r\nother causes a very small quantity of the public lands, when sold at public\r\nauction, commands a higher price than the minimum rates established by law.\r\nThe settlers on the public lands are, however, but rarely able to secure\r\ntheir homes and improvements at the public sales at that rate, because\r\nthese combinations, by means of the capital they command and their superior\r\nability to purchase, render it impossible for the settler to compete with\r\nthem in the market. By putting down all competition these combinations of\r\ncapitalists and speculators are usually enabled to purchase the lands,\r\nincluding the improvements of the settlers, at the minimum price of the\r\nGovernment, and either turn them out of their homes or extort from them,\r\naccording to their ability to pay, double or quadruple the amount paid for\r\nthem to the Government. It is to the enterprise and perseverance of the\r\nhardy pioneers of the West, who penetrate the wilderness with their\r\nfamilies, suffer the dangers, the privations, and hardships attending the\r\nsettlement of a new country, and prepare the way for the body of emigrants\r\nwho in the course of a few years usually follow them, that we are in a\r\ngreat degree indebted for the rapid extension and aggrandizement of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that no portion of our population are more patriotic\r\nthan the hardy and brave men of the frontier, or more ready to obey the\r\ncall of their country and to defend her rights and her honor whenever and\r\nby whatever enemy assailed. They should be protected from the grasping\r\nspeculator and secured, at the minimum price of the public lands, in the\r\nhumble homes which they have improved by their labor. With this end in\r\nview, all vexatious or unnecessary restrictions imposed upon them by the\r\nexisting preemption laws should be repealed or modified. It is the true\r\npolicy of the Government to afford facilities to its citizens to become the\r\nowners of small portions of our vast public domain at low and moderate\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nThe present system of managing the mineral lands of the United States is\r\nbelieved to be radically defective. More than 1,000,000 acres of the public\r\nlands, supposed to contain lead and other minerals, have been reserved from\r\nsale, and numerous leases upon them have been granted to individuals upon a\r\nstipulated rent. The system of granting leases has proved to be not only\r\nunprofitable to the Government, but unsatisfactory to the citizens who have\r\ngone upon the lands, and must, if continued, lay the foundation of much\r\nfuture difficulty between the Government and the lessees. According to the\r\nofficial records, the amount of rents received by the Government for the\r\nyears 1841, 1842, 1843, and 1844 was $6,354.74, while the expenses of the\r\nsystem during the same period, including salaries of superintendents,\r\nagents, clerks, and incidental expenses, were $26,111.11, the income being\r\nless than one-fourth of the expenses. To this pecuniary loss may be added\r\nthe injury sustained by the public in consequence of the destruction of\r\ntimber and the careless and wasteful manner of working the mines. The\r\nsystem has given rise to much litigation between the United States and\r\nindividual citizens, producing irritation and excitement in the mineral\r\nregion, and involving the Government in heavy additional expenditures. It\r\nis believed that similar losses and embarrassments will continue to occur\r\nwhile the present System of leasing these lands remains unchanged. These\r\nlands are now under the superintendence and care of the War Department,\r\nwith the ordinary duties of which they have no proper or natural\r\nconnection. I recommend the repeal of the present system, and that these\r\nlands be placed under the superintendence and management of the General\r\nLand Office, as other public lands, and be brought into market and sold\r\nupon such terms as Congress in their wisdom may prescribe, reserving to the\r\nGovernment an equitable percentage of the gross amount of mineral product,\r\nand that the preemption principle be extended to resident miners and\r\nsettlers upon them at the minimum price which may be established by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War for\r\ninformation respecting the present situation of the Army and its operations\r\nduring the past year, the state of our defenses, the condition of the\r\npublic works, and our relations with the various Indian tribes within our\r\nlimits or upon our borders. I invite your attention to the suggestions\r\ncontained in that report in relation to these prominent objects of national\r\ninterest. When orders were given during the past summer for concentrating a\r\nmilitary force on the western frontier of Texas, our troops were widely\r\ndispersed and in small detachments, occupying posts remote from each other.\r\nThe prompt and expeditious manner in which an army embracing more than half\r\nour peace establishment was drawn together on an emergency so sudden\r\nreflects great credit on the officers who were intrusted with the execution\r\nof these orders, as well as upon the discipline of the Army itself. To be\r\nin strength to protect and defend the people and territory of Texas in the\r\nevent Mexico should commence hostilities or invade her territories with a\r\nlarge army, which she threatened, I authorized the general assigned to the\r\ncommand of the army of occupation to make requisitions for additional\r\nforces from several of the States nearest the Texan territory, and which\r\ncould most expeditiously furnish them, if in his opinion a larger force\r\nthan that under his command and the auxiliary aid which under like\r\ncircumstances he was authorized to receive from Texas should be required.\r\nThe contingency upon which the exercise of this authority depended has not\r\noccurred. The circumstances under which two companies of State artillery\r\nfrom the city of New Orleans were sent into Texas and mustered into the\r\nservice of the United States are fully stated in the report of the\r\nSecretary of War. I recommend to Congress that provision be made for the\r\npayment of these troops, as well as a small number of Texan volunteers whom\r\nthe commanding general thought it necessary to receive or muster into our\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nDuring the last summer the First Regiment of Dragoons made extensive\r\nexcursions through the Indian country on our borders, a part of them\r\nadvancing nearly to the possessions of the Hudsons Bay Company in the\r\nnorth, and a part as far as the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains and the\r\nhead waters of the tributary streams of the Colorado of the West. The\r\nexhibition of this military force among the Indian tribes in those distant\r\nregions and the councils held with them by the commanders of the\r\nexpeditions, it is believed, will have a salutary influence in restraining\r\nthem from hostilities among themselves and maintaining friendly relations\r\nbetween them and the United States. An interesting account of one of these\r\nexcursions accompanies the report of the Secretary of War. Under the\r\ndirections of the War Department Brevet Captain Fremont, of the Corps of\r\nTopographical Engineers, has been employed since 1842 in exploring the\r\ncountry west of the Mississippi and beyond the Rocky Mountains. Two\r\nexpeditions have already been brought to a close, and the reports of that\r\nscientific and enterprising officer have furnished much interesting and\r\nvaluable information. He is now engaged in a third expedition, but it is\r\nnot expected that this arduous service will be completed in season to\r\nenable me to communicate the result to Congress at the present session.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Indian tribes are of a favorable character. The\r\npolicy of removing them to a country designed for their permanent residence\r\nwest of the Mississippi, and without the limits of the organized States and\r\nTerritories, is better appreciated by them than it was a few years ago,\r\nwhile education is now attended to and the habits of civilized life are\r\ngaining ground among them.\r\n\r\nSerious difficulties of long standing continue to distract the several\r\nparties into which the Cherokees are unhappily divided. The efforts of the\r\nGovernment to adjust the difficulties between them have heretofore proved\r\nunsuccessful, and there remains no probability that this desirable object\r\ncan be accomplished without the aid of further legislation by Congress. I\r\nwill at an early period of your session present the subject for your\r\nconsideration, accompanied with an exposition of the complaints and claims\r\nof the several parties into which the nation is divided, with a view to the\r\nadoption of such measures by Congress as may enable the Executive to do\r\njustice to them, respectively, and to put an end, if possible, to the\r\ndissensions which have long prevailed and still prevail among them.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for the present\r\ncondition of that branch of the national defense and for grave suggestions\r\nhaving for their object the increase of its efficiency and a greater\r\neconomy in its management. During the past year the officers and men have\r\nperformed their duty in a satisfactory manner. The orders which have been\r\ngiven have been executed with promptness and fidelity. A larger force than\r\nhas often formed one squadron under our flag was readily concentrated in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, and apparently without unusual effort. It is especially\r\nto be observed that notwithstanding the union of so considerable a force,\r\nno act was committed that even the jealousy of an irritated power could\r\nconstrue as an act of aggression, and that the commander of the squadron\r\nand his officers, in strict conformity with their instructions, holding\r\nthemselves ever ready for the most active duty, have achieved the still\r\npurer glory of contributing to the preservation of peace. It is believed\r\nthat at all our foreign stations the honor of our flag has been maintained\r\nand that generally our ships of war have been distinguished for their good\r\ndiscipline and order. I am happy to add that the display of maritime force\r\nwhich was required by the events of the summer has been made wholly within\r\nthe usual appropriations for the service of the year, so that no additional\r\nappropriations are required.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States, and with it the navigating interests,\r\nhave steadily and rapidly increased since the organization of our\r\nGovernment, until, it is believed, we are now second to but one power in\r\nthe world, and at no distant day we shall probably be inferior to none.\r\nExposed as they must be, it has been a wise policy to afford to these\r\nimportant interests protection with our ships of war distributed in the\r\ngreat highways of trade throughout the world. For more than thirty years\r\nappropriations have been made and annually expended for the gradual\r\nincrease of our naval forces. In peace our Navy performs the important duty\r\nof protecting our commerce, and in the event of war will be, as it has\r\nbeen, a most efficient means of defense.\r\n\r\nThe successful use of steam navigation on the ocean has been followed by\r\nthe introduction of war steamers in great and increasing numbers into the\r\nnavies of the principal maritime powers of the world. A due regard to our\r\nown safety and to an efficient protection to our large and increasing\r\ncommerce demands a corresponding increase on our part. No country has\r\ngreater facilities for the construction of vessels of this description than\r\nours, or can promise itself greater advantages from their employment. They\r\nare admirably adapted to the protection of our commerce, to the rapid\r\ntransmission of intelligence, and to the coast defense. In pursuance of the\r\nwise policy of a gradual increase of our Navy, large supplies of live-oak\r\ntimber and other materials for shipbuilding have been collected and are now\r\nunder shelter and in a state of good preservation, while iron steamers can\r\nbe built with great facility in various parts of the Union. The use of iron\r\nas a material, especially in the construction of steamers which can enter\r\nwith safety many of the harbors along our coast now inaccessible to vessels\r\nof greater draft, and the practicability of constructing them in the\r\ninterior, strongly recommend that liberal appropriations should be made for\r\nthis important object. Whatever may have been our policy in the earlier\r\nstages of the Government, when the nation was in its infancy, our shipping\r\ninterests and commerce comparatively small, our resources limited, our\r\npopulation sparse and scarcely extending beyond the limits of the original\r\nthirteen States, that policy must be essentially different now that we have\r\ngrown from three to more than twenty millions of people, that our commerce,\r\ncarried in our own ships, is found in every sea, and that our territorial\r\nboundaries and settlements have been so greatly expanded. Neither our\r\ncommerce nor our long line of coast on the ocean and on the Lakes can be\r\nsuccessfully defended against foreign aggression by means of fortifications\r\nalone. These are essential at important commercial and military points, but\r\nour chief reliance for this object must be on a well-organized, efficient\r\nnavy. The benefits resulting from such a navy are not confined to the\r\nAtlantic States. The productions of the interior which seek a market abroad\r\nare directly dependent on the safety and freedom of our commerce. The\r\noccupation of the Balize below New Orleans by a hostile force would\r\nembarrass, if not stagnate, the whole export trade of the Mississippi and\r\naffect the value of the agricultural products of the entire valley of that\r\nmighty river and its tributaries.\r\n\r\nIt has never been our policy to maintain large standing armies in time of\r\npeace. They are contrary to the genius of our free institutions, would\r\nimpose heavy burdens on the people and be dangerous to public liberty. Our\r\nreliance for protection and defense on the land must be mainly on our\r\ncitizen soldiers, who will be ever ready, as they ever have been ready in\r\ntimes past, to rush with alacrity, at the call of their country, to her\r\ndefense. This description of force, however, can not defend our coast,\r\nharbors, and inland seas, nor protect our commerce on the ocean or the\r\nLakes. These must be protected by our Navy.\r\n\r\nConsidering an increased naval force, and especially of steam vessels,\r\ncorresponding with our growth and importance as a nation, and proportioned\r\nto the increased and increasing naval power of other nations, of vast\r\nimportance as regards our safety, and the great and growing interests to be\r\nprotected by it, I recommend the subject to the favorable consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General herewith communicated contains a\r\ndetailed statement of the operations of his Department during the pass\r\nyear. It will be seen that the income from postages will fall short of the\r\nexpenditures for the year between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000. This\r\ndeficiency has been caused by the reduction of the rates of postage, which\r\nwas made by the act of the 3d of March last. No principle has been more\r\ngenerally acquiesced in by the people than that this Department should\r\nsustain itself by limiting its expenditures to its income. Congress has\r\nnever sought to make it a source of revenue for general purposes except for\r\na short period during the last war with Great Britain, nor should it ever\r\nbecome a charge on the general Treasury. If Congress shall adhere to this\r\nprinciple, as I think they ought, it will be necessary either to curtail\r\nthe present mail service so as to reduce the expenditures, or so to modify\r\nthe act of the 3d of March last as to improve its revenues. The extension\r\nof the mail service and the additional facilities which will be demanded by\r\nthe rapid extension and increase of population on our western frontier will\r\nnot admit of such curtailment as will materially reduce the present\r\nexpenditures. In the adjustment of the tariff of postages the interests of\r\nthe people demand that the lowest rates be adopted which will produce the\r\nnecessary revenue to meet the expenditures of the Department. I invite the\r\nattention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General on this\r\nsubject, under the belief that such a modification of the late law may be\r\nmade as will yield sufficient revenue without further calls on the\r\nTreasury, and with very little change in the present rates of postage.\r\nProper measures have been taken in pursuance of the act of the 3d of March\r\nlast for the establishment of lines of mail steamers between this and\r\nforeign countries. The importance of this service commends itself strongly\r\nto favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of our country the public business which devolves on the\r\nheads of the several Executive Departments has greatly increased. In some\r\nrespects the distribution of duties among them seems to be incongruous, and\r\nmany of these might be transferred from one to another with advantage to\r\nthe public interests. A more auspicious time for the consideration of this\r\nsubject by Congress, with a view to system in the organization of the\r\nseveral Departments and a more appropriate division of the public business,\r\nwill not probably occur.\r\n\r\nThe most important duties of the State Department relate to our foreign\r\naffairs. By the great enlargement of the family of nations, the increase of\r\nour commerce, and the corresponding extension of our consular system the\r\nbusiness of this Department has been greatly increased. In its present\r\norganization many duties of a domestic nature and consisting of details are\r\ndevolved on the Secretary of State, which do not appropriately belong to\r\nthe foreign department of the Government and may properly be transferred to\r\nsome other Department. One of these grows out of the present state of the\r\nlaw concerning the Patent Office, which a few years since was a subordinate\r\nclerkship, but has become a distinct bureau of great importance. With an\r\nexcellent internal organization, it is still connected with the State\r\nDepartment. In the transaction of its business questions of much importance\r\nto inventors and to the community frequently arise, which by existing laws\r\nare referred for decision to a board of which the Secretary of State is a\r\nmember. These questions are legal, and the connection which now exists\r\nbetween the State Department and the Patent Office may with great propriety\r\nand advantage be transferred to the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nIn his last annual message to Congress Mr. Madison invited attention to a\r\nproper provision for the Attorney-General as \"an important improvement in\r\nthe executive establishment.\" This recommendation was repeated by some of\r\nhis successors. The official duties of the Attorney-General have been much\r\nincreased within a few years, and his office has become one of great\r\nimportance. His duties may be still further increased with advantage to the\r\npublic interests. As an executive officer his residence and constant\r\nattention at the seat of Government are required. Legal questions involving\r\nimportant principles and large amounts of public money are constantly\r\nreferred to him by the President and Executive Departments for his\r\nexamination and decision. The public business under his official management\r\nbefore the judiciary has been so augmented by the extension of our\r\nterritory and the acts of Congress authorizing suits against the United\r\nStates for large bodies of valuable public lands as greatly to increase his\r\nlabors and responsibilities. I therefore recommend that the\r\nAttorney-General be placed on the same footing with the heads of the other\r\nExecutive Departments, with such subordinate officers provided by law for\r\nhis Department as may be required to discharge the additional duties which\r\nhave been or may be devolved upon him.\r\n\r\nCongress possess the power of exclusive legislation over the District of\r\nColumbia, and I commend the interests of its inhabitants to your favorable\r\nconsideration. The people of this District have no legislative body of\r\ntheir own, and must confide their local as well as their general interests\r\nto representatives in whose election they have no voice and over whose\r\nofficial conduct they have no control. Each member of the National\r\nLegislature should consider himself as their immediate representative, and\r\nshould be the more ready to give attention to their interests and wants\r\nbecause he is not responsible to them. I recommend that a liberal and\r\ngenerous spirit may characterize your measures in relation to them. I shall\r\nbe ever disposed to show a proper regard for their wishes and, within\r\nconstitutional limits, shall at all times cheerfully cooperate with you for\r\nthe advancement of their welfare.\r\n\r\nI trust it may not be deemed inappropriate to the occasion for me to dwell\r\nfor a moment on the memory of the most eminent citizen of our country who\r\nduring the summer that is gone by has descended to the tomb. The enjoyment\r\nof contemplating, at the advanced age of near fourscore years, the happy\r\ncondition of his country cheered the last hours of Andrew Jackson, who\r\ndeparted this life in the tranquil hope of a blessed immortality. His death\r\nwas happy, as his life had been eminently useful. He had an unfaltering\r\nconfidence in the virtue and capacity of the people and in the permanence\r\nof that free Government which he had largely contributed to establish and\r\ndefend. His great deeds had secured to him the affections of his\r\nfellow-citizens, and it was his happiness to witness the growth and glory\r\nof his country, which he loved so well. He departed amidst the benedictions\r\nof millions of free-men. The nation paid its tribute to his memory at his\r\ntomb. Coming generations will learn from his example the love of country\r\nand the rights of man. In his language on a similar occasion to the\r\npresent, \"I now commend you, fellow-citizens, to the guidance of Almighty\r\nGod, with a full reliance on His merciful providence for the maintenance of\r\nour free institutions, and with an earnest supplication that whatever\r\nerrors it may be my lot to commit in discharging the arduous duties which\r\nhave devolved on me will find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom of your\r\ncounsels.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Polk\r\nDecember 8, 1846\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn resuming your labors in the service of the people it is a subject of\r\ncongratulation that there has been no period in our past history when all\r\nthe elements of national prosperity have been so fully developed. Since\r\nyour last session no afflicting dispensation has visited our country.\r\nGeneral good health has prevailed, abundance has crowned the toil of the\r\nhusbandman, and labor in all its branches is receiving an ample reward,\r\nwhile education, science, and the arts are rapidly enlarging the means of\r\nsocial happiness. The progress of our country in her career of greatness,\r\nnot only in the vast extension of our territorial limits and the rapid\r\nincrease of our population, but in resources and wealth and in the happy\r\ncondition of our people, is without an example in the history of nations.\r\n\r\nAs the wisdom, strength, and beneficence of our free institutions are\r\nunfolded, every day adds fresh motives to contentment and fresh incentives\r\nto patriotism.\r\n\r\nOur devout and sincere acknowledgments are due to the gracious Giver of All\r\nGood for the numberless blessings which our beloved country enjoys.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of high satisfaction to know that the relations of the\r\nUnited States with all other nations, with a single exception, are of the\r\nmost amicable character. Sincerely attached to the policy of peace early\r\nadopted and steadily pursued by this Government, I have anxiously desired\r\nto cultivate and cherish friendship and commerce with every foreign power.\r\nThe spirit and habits of the American people are favorable to the\r\nmaintenance of such international harmony. In adhering to this wise policy,\r\na preliminary and paramount duty obviously consists in the protection of\r\nour national interests from encroachment or sacrifice and our national\r\nhonor from reproach. These must be maintained at any hazard. They admit of\r\nno compromise or neglect, and must be scrupulously and constantly guarded.\r\nIn their vigilant vindication collision and conflict with foreign powers\r\nmay sometimes become unavoidable. Such has been our scrupulous adherence to\r\nthe dictates of justice in all our foreign intercourse that, though\r\nsteadily and rapidly advancing in prosperity and power, we have given no\r\njust cause of complaint to any nation and have enjoyed the blessings of\r\npeace for more than thirty years. From a policy so sacred to humanity and\r\nso salutary in its effects upon our political system we should never be\r\ninduced voluntarily to depart.\r\n\r\nThe existing war with Mexico was neither desired nor provoked by the United\r\nStates. On the contrary, all honorable means were resorted to to avert it.\r\nAfter years of endurance of aggravated and unredressed wrongs on our part,\r\nMexico, in violation of solemn treaty stipulations and of every principle\r\nof justice recognized by civilized nations, commenced hostilities, and thus\r\nby her own act forced the war upon us. Long before the advance of our Army\r\nto the left bank of the Rio Grande we had ample cause of war against\r\nMexico, and had the United States resorted to this extremity we might have\r\nappealed to the whole civilized world for the justice of our cause. I deem\r\nit to be my duty to present to you on the present occasion a condensed\r\nreview of the injuries we had sustained, of the causes which led to the\r\nwar, and of its progress since its commencement. This is rendered the more\r\nnecessary because of the misapprehensions which have to some extent\r\nprevailed as to its origin and true character. The war has been represented\r\nas unjust and unnecessary and as one of aggression on our part upon a weak\r\nand injured enemy. Such erroneous views, though entertained by but few,\r\nhave been widely and extensively circulated, not only at home, but have\r\nbeen spread throughout Mexico and the whole world. A more effectual means\r\ncould not have been devised to encourage the enemy and protract the war\r\nthan to advocate and adhere to their cause, and thus give them \"aid and\r\ncomfort.\" It is a source of national pride and exultation that the great\r\nbody of our people have thrown no such obstacles in the way of the\r\nGovernment in prosecuting the war successfully, but have shown themselves\r\nto be eminently patriotic and ready to vindicate their country's honor and\r\ninterests at any sacrifice. The alacrity and promptness with which our\r\nvolunteer forces rushed to the field on their country's call prove not only\r\ntheir patriotism, but their deep conviction that our cause is just.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs which we have suffered from Mexico almost ever since she became\r\nan independent power and the patient endurance with which we have borne\r\nthem are without a parallel in the history of modern civilized nations.\r\nThere is reason to believe that if these wrongs had been resented and\r\nresisted in the first instance the present war might have been avoided. One\r\noutrage, however, permitted to pass with impunity almost necessarily\r\nencouraged the perpetration of another, until at last Mexico seemed to\r\nattribute to weakness and indecision on our part a forbearance which was\r\nthe offspring of magnanimity and of a sincere desire to preserve friendly\r\nrelations with a sister republic.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Mexico achieved her independence, which the United States were\r\nthe first among the nations to acknowledge, when she commenced the system\r\nof insult and spoliation which she has ever since pursued. Our citizens\r\nengaged in lawful commerce were imprisoned, their vessels seized, and our\r\nflag insulted in her ports. If money was wanted, the lawless seizure and\r\nconfiscation of our merchant vessels and their cargoes was a ready\r\nresource, and if to accomplish their purposes it became necessary to\r\nimprison the owners, captains, and crews, it was done. Rulers superseded\r\nrulers in Mexico in rapid succession, but still there was no change in this\r\nsystem of depredation. The Government of the United States made repeated\r\nreclamations on behalf of its citizens, but these were answered by the\r\nperpetration of new outrages. Promises of redress made by Mexico in the\r\nmost solemn forms were postponed or evaded. The files and records of the\r\nDepartment of State contain conclusive proofs of numerous lawless acts\r\nperpetrated upon the property and persons of our citizens by Mexico, and of\r\nwanton insults to our national flag. The interposition of our Government to\r\nobtain redress was again and again invoked under circumstances which no\r\nnation ought to disregard. It was hoped that these outrages would cease and\r\nthat Mexico would be restrained by the laws which regulate the conduct of\r\ncivilized nations in their intercourse with each other after the treaty of\r\namity, commerce, and navigation of the 5th of April, 1831, was concluded\r\nbetween the two Republics; but this hope soon proved to be vain. The course\r\nof seizure and confiscation of the property of our citizens, the violation\r\nof their persons, and the insults to our flag pursued by Mexico previous to\r\nthat time were scarcely suspended for even a brief period, although the\r\ntreaty so clearly defines the rights and duties of the respective parties\r\nthat it is impossible to misunderstand or mistake them. In less than seven\r\nyears after the conclusion of that treaty our grievances had become so\r\nintolerable that in the opinion of President Jackson they should no longer\r\nbe endured. In his message to Congress in February, 1837, he presented them\r\nto the consideration of that body, and declared that--\r\n\r\nThe length of time since some of the injuries have been committed, the\r\nrepeated and unavailing applications for redress, the wanton character of\r\nsome of the outrages upon the property and persons of our citizens, upon\r\nthe officers and flag of the United States, independent of recent insults\r\nto this Government and people by the late extraordinary Mexican minister,\r\nwould justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war.\r\n\r\nIn a spirit of kindness and forbearance, however, he recommended reprisals\r\nas a milder mode of redress. He declared that war should not be used as a\r\nremedy \"by just and generous nations, confiding in their strength for\r\ninjuries committed, if it can be honorably avoided,\" and added:\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to me that, considering the present embarrassed condition\r\nof that country, we should act with both wisdom and moderation by giving to\r\nMexico one more opportunity to atone for the past before we take redress\r\ninto our Own hands. To avoid all misconception on the part of Mexico, as\r\nwell as to protect our own national character from reproach, this\r\nopportunity should be given with the avowed design and full preparation to\r\ntake immediate satisfaction if it should not be obtained on a repetition of\r\nthe demand for it. To this end I recommend that an act be passed\r\nauthorizing reprisals, and the use of the naval force of the United States\r\nby the Executive against Mexico to enforce them, in the event of a refusal\r\nby the Mexican Government to come to an amicable adjustment of the matters\r\nin controversy between us upon another demand thereof made from on board\r\nout of our vessels of war on the coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\nCommittees of both Houses of Congress, to which this message of the\r\nPresident was referred, fully sustained his views of the character of the\r\nwrongs which we had suffered from Mexico, and recommended that another\r\ndemand for redress should be made before authorizing war or reprisals. The\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, in their report, say:\r\n\r\nAfter such a demand, should prompt justice be refused by the Mexican\r\nGovernment, we may appeal to all nations, not only for the equity and\r\nmoderation with which we shall have acted toward a sister republic, but for\r\nthe necessity which will then compel us to seek redress for our wrongs,\r\neither by actual war or by reprisals. The subject will then be presented\r\nbefore Congress, at the commencement of the next session, in a clear and\r\ndistinct form, and the committee can not doubt but that such measures will\r\nbe immediately adopted as may be necessary to vindicate the honor of the\r\ncountry and insure ample reparation to our injured fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives made a\r\nsimilar recommendation. In their report they say that--\r\n\r\nThey fully concur with the President that ample cause exists for taking\r\nredress into our own hands, and believe that we should be justified in the\r\nopinion of other nations for taking such a step. But they are willing to\r\ntry the experiment of another demand, made in the most solemn form, upon\r\nthe justice of the Mexican Government before any further proceedings are\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nNo difference of opinion upon the subject is believed to have existed in\r\nCongress at that time; the executive and legislative departments concurred;\r\nand yet such has been our forbearance and desire to preserve peace with\r\nMexico that the wrongs of which we then complained, and which gave rise to\r\nthese solemn proceedings, not only remain unredressed to this day, but\r\nadditional causes of complaint of an aggravated character have ever since\r\nbeen accumulating. Shortly after these proceedings a special messenger was\r\ndispatched to Mexico to make a final demand for redress, and on the 20th of\r\nJuly, 1837, the demand was made. The reply of the Mexican Government bears\r\ndate on the 29th of the same month, and contains assurances of the \"anxious\r\nwish\" of the Mexican Government \"not to delay the moment of that final and\r\nequitable adjustment which is to terminate the existing difficulties\r\nbetween the two Governments;\" that \"nothing should be left undone which may\r\ncontribute to the most speedy and equitable determination of the subjects\r\nwhich have so seriously engaged the attention of the American Government;\"\r\nthat the \"Mexican Government would adopt as the only guides for its conduct\r\nthe plainest principles of public right, the sacred obligations imposed by\r\ninternational law, and the religious faith of treaties,\" and that \"whatever\r\nreason and justice may dictate respecting each case will be done.\" The\r\nassurance was further given that the decision of the Mexican Government\r\nupon each cause of complaint for which redress had been demanded should be\r\ncommunicated to the Government of the United States by the Mexican minister\r\nat Washington.\r\n\r\nThese solemn assurances in answer to our demand for redress were\r\ndisregarded. By making them, however, Mexico obtained further delay.\r\nPresident Van Buren, in his annual message to Congress of the 5th of\r\nDecember, 1837, states that \"although the larger number\" of our demands for\r\nredress, \"and many of them aggravated cases of personal wrongs, have been\r\nnow for years before the Mexican Government, and some of the causes of\r\nnational complaint, and those of the most offensive character, admitted of\r\nimmediate, simple, and satisfactory replies, it is only within a few days\r\npast that any specific communication in answer to our last demand, made\r\nfive months ago, has been received from the Mexican minister;\" and that\r\n\"for not one of our public complaints has satisfaction been given or\r\noffered, that but one of the cases of personal wrong has been favorably\r\nconsidered, and that but four cases of both descriptions out of all those\r\nformally presented and earnestly pressed have as yet been decided upon by\r\nthe Mexican Government.\" President Van Buren, believing that it would be\r\nvain to make any further attempt to obtain redress by the ordinary means\r\nwithin the power of the Executive, communicated this opinion to Congress in\r\nthe message referred to, in which he said:\r\n\r\nOn a careful and deliberate examination of their contents of the\r\ncorrespondence with the Mexican Government, and considering the spirit\r\nmanifested by the Mexican Government, it has become my painful duty to\r\nreturn the subject as it now stands to Congress, to whom it belongs to\r\ndecide upon the time, the mode, and the measure of redress.\r\n\r\nHad the United States at that time adopted compulsory measures and taken\r\nredress into their own hands, all our difficulties with Mexico would\r\nprobably have been long since adjusted and the existing war have been\r\naverted. Magnanimity and moderation on our part only had the effect to\r\ncomplicate these difficulties and render an amicable settlement of them the\r\nmore embarrassing. That such measures of redress under similar provocations\r\ncommitted by any of the powerful nations of Europe would have been promptly\r\nresorted to by the United States can not be doubted. The national honor and\r\nthe preservation of the national character throughout the world, as well as\r\nour own self-respect and the protection due to our own citizens, would have\r\nrendered such a resort indispensable. The history of no civilized nation in\r\nmodern times has presented within so brief a period so many wanton attacks\r\nupon the honor of its flag and upon the property and persons of its\r\ncitizens as had at that time been borne by the United States from the\r\nMexican authorities and people. But Mexico was a sister republic on the\r\nNorth American continent, occupying a territory contiguous to our own, and\r\nwas in a feeble and distracted condition, and these considerations, it is\r\npresumed, induced Congress to forbear still longer.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking redress into our own hands, a new negotiation was entered\r\nupon with fair promises on the part of Mexico, but with the real purpose,\r\nas the event has proved, of indefinitely postponing the reparation which we\r\ndemanded, and which was so justly due. This negotiation, after more than a\r\nyear's delay, resulted in the convention of the 11th of April, 1839, \"for\r\nthe adjustment of claims of citizens of the United States of America upon\r\nthe Government of the Mexican Republic.\" The joint board of commissioners\r\ncreated by this convention to examine and decide upon these claims was not\r\norganized until the month of August, 1840, and under the terms of the\r\nconvention they were to terminate their duties within eighteen months from\r\nthat time. Four of the eighteen months were consumed in preliminary\r\ndiscussions on frivolous and dilatory points raised by the Mexican\r\ncommissioners, and it was not until the month of December, 1840, that they\r\ncommenced the examination of the claims of our citizens upon Mexico.\r\nFourteen months only remained to examine and decide upon these numerous and\r\ncomplicated cases. In the month of February, 1842, the term of the\r\ncommission expired, leaving many claims undisposed of for want of time. The\r\nclaims which were allowed by the board and by the umpire authorized by the\r\nconvention to decide in case of disagreement between the Mexican and\r\nAmerican commissioners amounted to $2,026,139.68. There were pending before\r\nthe umpire when the commission expired additional claims, which had been\r\nexamined and awarded by the American commissioners and had not been allowed\r\nby the Mexican commissioners, amounting to $928,627.88, upon which he did\r\nnot decide, alleging that his authority had ceased with the termination of\r\nthe joint commission. Besides these claims, there were others of American\r\ncitizens amounting to $3,336,837.05, which had been submitted to the board,\r\nand upon which they had not time to decide before their final adjournment.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $2,026,139.68, which had been awarded to the claimants, was a\r\nliquidated and ascertained debt due by Mexico, about which there could be\r\nno dispute, and which she was bound to pay according to the terms of the\r\nconvention. Soon after the final awards for this amount had been made the\r\nMexican Government asked for a postponement of the time of making payment,\r\nalleging that it would be inconvenient to make the payment at the time\r\nstipulated. In the spirit of forbearing kindness toward a sister republic,\r\nwhich Mexico has so long abused, the United States promptly complied with\r\nher request. A second convention was accordingly concluded between the two\r\nGovernments on the 30th of January, 1843, which upon its face declares that\r\n\"this new arrangement is entered into for the accommodation of Mexico.\" By\r\nthe terms of this convention all the interest due on the awards which had\r\nbeen made in favor of the claimants under the convention of the 11th of\r\nApril, 1839, was to be paid to them on the 30th of April, 1843, and \"the\r\nprincipal of the said awards and the interest accruing thereon\" was\r\nstipulated to \"be paid in five years, in equal installments every three\r\nmonths.\" Notwithstanding this new convention was entered into at the\r\nrequest of Mexico and for the purpose of relieving her from embarrassment,\r\nthe claimants have only received the interest due on the 30th of April,\r\n1843, and three of the twenty installments. Although the payment of the sum\r\nthus liquidated and confessedly due by Mexico to our citizens as indemnity\r\nfor acknowledged acts of outrage and wrong was secured by treaty, the\r\nobligations of which are ever held sacred by all just nations, yet Mexico\r\nhas violated this solemn engagement by failing and refusing to make the\r\npayment. The two installments due in April and July, 1844, under the\r\npeculiar circumstances connected with them, have been assumed by the United\r\nStates and discharged to the claimants, but they are still due by Mexico.\r\nBut this is not all of which we have just cause of complaint. To provide a\r\nremedy for the claimants whose cases were not decided by the joint\r\ncommission under the convention of April 11, 1839, it was expressly\r\nstipulated by the sixth article of the convention of the 30th of January,\r\n1843, that--\r\n\r\nA new convention shall be entered into for the settlement of all claims of\r\nthe Government and citizens of the United States against the Republic of\r\nMexico which were not finally decided by the late commission which met in\r\nthe city of Washington, and of all claims of the Government and citizens of\r\nMexico against the United States.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this stipulation, a third convention was concluded and\r\nsigned at the city of Mexico on the 20th of November, 1843, by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the two Governments, by which provision was made for\r\nascertaining and paying these claims. In January, 1844, this convention was\r\nratified by the Senate of the United States with two amendments, which were\r\nmanifestly reasonable in their character. Upon a reference of the\r\namendments proposed to the Government of Mexico, the same evasions,\r\ndifficulties, and delays were interposed which have so long marked the\r\npolicy of that Government toward the United States. It has not even yet\r\ndecided whether it would or would not accede to them, although the subject\r\nhas been repeatedly pressed upon its consideration. Mexico has thus\r\nviolated a second time the faith of treaties by failing or refusing to\r\ncarry into effect the sixth article of the convention of January, 1843.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of the wrongs which we have suffered and patiently\r\nendured from Mexico through a long series of years. So far from affording\r\nreasonable satisfaction for the injuries and insults we had borne, a great\r\naggravation of them consists in the fact that while the United States,\r\nanxious to preserve a good understanding with Mexico, have been constantly\r\nbut vainly employed in seeking redress for past wrongs, new outrages were\r\nconstantly occurring, which have continued to increase our causes of\r\ncomplaint and to swell the amount of our demands. While the citizens of the\r\nUnited States were conducting a lawful commerce with Mexico under the\r\nguaranty of a treaty of \"amity, commerce, and navigation,\" many of them\r\nhave suffered all the injuries which would have resulted from open war.\r\nThis treaty, instead of affording protection to our citizens, has been the\r\nmeans of inviting them into the ports of Mexico that they might be, as they\r\nhave been in numerous instances, plundered of their property and deprived\r\nof their personal liberty if they dared insist on their rights. Had the\r\nunlawful seizures of American property and the violation of the personal\r\nliberty of our citizens, to say nothing of the insults to our flag, which\r\nhave occurred in the ports of Mexico taken place on the high seas, they\r\nwould themselves long since have constituted a state of actual war between\r\nthe two countries. In so long suffering Mexico to violate her most solemn\r\ntreaty obligations, plunder our citizens of their property, and imprison\r\ntheir persons without affording them any redress we have failed to perform\r\none of the first and highest duties which every government owes to its\r\ncitizens, and the consequence has been that many of them have been reduced\r\nfrom a state of affluence to bankruptcy. The proud name of American\r\ncitizen, which ought to protect all who bear it from insult and injury\r\nthroughout the world, has afforded no such protection to our citizens in\r\nMexico. We had ample cause of war against Mexico long before the breaking\r\nout of hostilities; but even then we forbore to take redress into our own\r\nhands until Mexico herself became the aggressor by invading our soil in\r\nhostile array and shedding the blood of our citizens.\r\n\r\nSuch are the grave causes of complaint on the part of the United States\r\nagainst Mexico--causes which existed long before the annexation of Texas to\r\nthe American Union; and yet, animated by the love of peace and a\r\nmagnanimous moderation, we did not adopt those measures of redress which\r\nunder such circumstances are the justified resort of injured nations.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Texas to the United States constituted no just cause of\r\noffense to Mexico. The pretext that it did so is wholly inconsistent and\r\nirreconcilable with well-authenticated facts connected with the revolution\r\nby which Texas became independent of Mexico. That this may be the more\r\nmanifest, it may be proper to advert to the causes and to the history of\r\nthe principal events of that revolution.\r\n\r\nTexas constituted a portion of the ancient Province of Louisiana, ceded to\r\nthe United States by France in the year 1803. In the year 1819 the United\r\nStates, by the Florida treaty, ceded to Spain all that part of Louisiana\r\nwithin the present limits of Texas, and Mexico, by the revolution which\r\nseparated her from Spain and rendered her an independent nation, succeeded\r\nto the rights of the mother country over this territory. In the year 1824\r\nMexico established a federal constitution, under which the Mexican Republic\r\nwas composed of a number of sovereign States confederated together in a\r\nfederal union similar to our own. Each of these States had its own\r\nexecutive, legislature, and judiciary, and for all except federal purposes\r\nwas as independent of the General Government and that of the other States\r\nas is Pennsylvania or Virginia under our Constitution. Texas and Coahuila\r\nunited and formed one of these Mexican States. The State constitution which\r\nthey adopted, and which was approved by the Mexican Confederacy, asserted\r\nthat they were \"free and independent of the other Mexican United States and\r\nof every other power and dominion whatsoever,\" and proclaimed the great\r\nprinciple of human liberty that \"the sovereignty of the state resides\r\noriginally and essentially in the general mass of the individuals who\r\ncompose it.\" To the Government under this constitution, as well as to that\r\nunder the federal constitution, the people of Texas owed allegiance.\r\n\r\nEmigrants from foreign countries, including the United States, were invited\r\nby the colonization laws of the State and of the Federal Government to\r\nsettle in Texas. Advantageous terms were offered to induce them to leave\r\ntheir own country and become Mexican citizens. This invitation was accepted\r\nby many of our citizens in the full faith that in their new home they would\r\nbe governed by laws enacted by representatives elected by themselves, and\r\nthat their lives, liberty, and property would be protected by\r\nconstitutional guaranties similar to those which existed in the Republic\r\nthey had left. Under a Government thus organized they continued until the\r\nyear 1835, when a military revolution broke out in the City of Mexico which\r\nentirely subverted the federal and State constitutions and placed a\r\nmilitary dictator at the head of the Government. By a sweeping decree of a\r\nCongress subservient to the will of the Dictator the several State\r\nconstitutions were abolished and the States themselves converted into mere\r\ndepartments of the central Government. The people of Texas were unwilling\r\nto submit to this usurpation. Resistance to such tyranny became a high\r\nduty. Texas was fully absolved from all allegiance to the central\r\nGovernment of Mexico from the moment that Government had abolished her\r\nState constitution and in its place substituted an arbitrary and despotic\r\ncentral government. Such were the principal causes of the Texan revolution.\r\nThe people of Texas at once determined upon resistance and flew to arms. In\r\nthe midst of these important and exciting events, however, they did not\r\nomit to place their liberties upon a secure and permanent foundation. They\r\nelected members to a convention, who in the month of March, 1836, issued a\r\nformal declaration that their \"political connection with the Mexican nation\r\nhas forever ended, and that the people of Texas do now constitute a free,\r\nsovereign, and independent Republic, and are fully invested with all the\r\nrights and attributes which properly belong to independent nations.\" They\r\nalso adopted for their government a liberal republican constitution. About\r\nthe same time Santa Anna, then the Dictator of Mexico, invaded Texas with a\r\nnumerous army for the purpose of subduing her people and enforcing\r\nobedience to his arbitrary and despotic Government. On the 21st of April,\r\n1836, he was met by the Texan citizen soldiers, and on that day was\r\nachieved by them the memorable victory of San Jacinto, by which they\r\nconquered their independence. Considering the numbers engaged on the\r\nrespective sides, history does not record a more brilliant achievement.\r\nSanta Anna himself was among the captives.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1836, Santa Anna acknowledged by a treaty with the\r\nTexan authorities in the most solemn form \"the full, entire, and perfect\r\nindependence of the Republic of Texas.\" It is true he was then a prisoner\r\nof war, but it is equally true that he had failed to reconquer Texas, and\r\nhad met with signal defeat; that his authority had not been revoked, and\r\nthat by virtue of this treaty he obtained his personal release. By it\r\nhostilities were suspended, and the army which had invaded Texas under his\r\ncommand returned in pursuance of this arrangement unmolested to Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom the day that the battle of San Jacinto was fought until the present\r\nhour Mexico has never possessed the power to reconquer Texas. In the\r\nlanguage of the Secretary of State of the United States in a dispatch to\r\nour minister in Mexico under date of the 8th of July, 1842--\r\n\r\nMexico may have chosen to consider, and may still choose to consider, Texas\r\nas having been at all times since 1835, and as still continuing, a\r\nrebellious province; but the world has been obliged to take a very\r\ndifferent view of the matter. From the time of the battle of San Jacinto,\r\nin April, 1836, to the present moment, Texas has exhibited the same\r\nexternal signs of national independence as Mexico herself, and with quite\r\nas much stability of government. Practically free and independent,\r\nacknowledged as a political sovereignty by the principal powers of the\r\nworld, no hostile foot finding rest within her territory for six or seven\r\nyears, and Mexico herself refraining for all that period from any further\r\nattempt to reestablish her own authority over that territory, it can not\r\nbut be surprising to find Mr. De Bocanegra the secretary of foreign affairs\r\nof Mexico complaining that for that whole period citizens of the United\r\nStates or its Government have been favoring the rebels of Texas and\r\nsupplying them with vessels, ammunition, and money, as if the war for the\r\nreduction of the Province of Texas had been constantly prosecuted by\r\nMexico, and her success prevented by these influences from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn the same dispatch the Secretary of State affirms that--\r\n\r\nSince 1837 the United States have regarded Texas as an independent\r\nsovereignty as much as Mexico, and that trade and commerce with citizens of\r\na government at war with Mexico can not on that account be regarded as an\r\nintercourse by which assistance and succor are given to Mexican rebels. The\r\nwhole current of Mr. De Bocanegra's remarks runs in the same direction, as\r\nif the independence of Texas had not been acknowledged. It has been\r\nacknowledged; it was acknowledged in 1837 against the remonstrance and\r\nprotest of Mexico, and most of the acts of any importance of which Mr. De\r\nBocanegra complains flow necessarily from that recognition. He speaks of\r\nTexas as still being \"an integral part of the territory of the Mexican\r\nRepublic,\" but he can not but understand that the United States do not so\r\nregard it. The real complaint of Mexico, therefore, is in substance neither\r\nmore nor less than a complaint against the recognition of Texan\r\nindependence. It may be thought rather late to repeat that complaint, and\r\nnot quite just to confine it to the United States to the exemption of\r\nEngland, France, and Belgium, unless the United States, having been the\r\nfirst to acknowledge the independence of Mexico herself, are to be blamed\r\nfor setting an example for the recognition of that of Texas.\r\n\r\nAnd he added that--\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, public treaties, and the laws oblige the President to\r\nregard Texas as an independent state, and its territory as no part of the\r\nterritory of Mexico.\r\n\r\nTexas had been an independent state, with an organized government, defying\r\nthe power of Mexico to overthrow or reconquer her, for more than ten years\r\nbefore Mexico commenced the present war against the United States. Texas\r\nhad given such evidence to the world of her ability to maintain her\r\nseparate existence as an independent nation that she had been formally\r\nrecognized as such not only by the United States, but by several of the\r\nprincipal powers of Europe. These powers had entered into treaties of\r\namity, commerce, and navigation with her. They had received and accredited\r\nher ministers and other diplomatic agents at their respective courts, and\r\nthey had commissioned ministers and diplomatic agents on their part to the\r\nGovernment of Texas. If Mexico, notwithstanding all this and her utter\r\ninability to subdue or reconquer Texas, still stubbornly refused to\r\nrecognize her as an independent nation, she was none the less so on that\r\naccount. Mexico herself had been recognized as an independent nation by the\r\nUnited States and by other powers many years before Spain, of which before\r\nher revolution she had been a colony, would agree to recognize her as such;\r\nand yet Mexico was at that time in the estimation of the civilized world,\r\nand in fact, none the less an independent power because Spain still claimed\r\nher as a colony. If Spain had continued until the present period to assert\r\nthat Mexico was one of her colonies in rebellion against her, this would\r\nnot have made her so or changed the fact of her independent existence.\r\nTexas at the period of her annexation to the United States bore the same\r\nrelation to Mexico that Mexico had borne to Spain for many years before\r\nSpain acknowledged her independence, with this important difference, that\r\nbefore the annexation of Texas to the United States was consummated Mexico\r\nherself, by a formal act of her Government, had acknowledged the\r\nindependence of Texas as a nation. It is true that in the act of\r\nrecognition she prescribed a condition which she had no power or authority\r\nto impose--that Texas should not annex herself to any other power--but this\r\ncould not detract in any degree from the recognition which Mexico then made\r\nof her actual independence. Upon this plain statement of facts, it is\r\nabsurd for Mexico to allege as a pretext for commencing hostilities against\r\nthe United States that Texas is still a part of her territory.\r\n\r\nBut there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground\r\nthat the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces instead of the Rio\r\nGrande, and that therefore in marching our Army to the east bank of the\r\nlatter river we passed the Texan line and invaded the territory of Mexico.\r\nA simple statement of facts known to exist will conclusively refute such an\r\nassumption. Texas, as ceded to the United States by France in 1803, has\r\nbeen always claimed as extending west to the Rio Grande or Rio Bravo. This\r\nfact is established by the authority of our most eminent statesmen at a\r\nperiod when the question was as well, if not better, understood than it is\r\nat present. During Mr. Jefferson's Administration Messrs. Monroe and\r\nPinckney, who had been sent on a special mission to Madrid, charged among\r\nother things with the adjustment of boundary between the two countries, in\r\na note addressed to the Spanish minister of foreign affairs under date of\r\nthe 28th of January, 1805, assert that the boundaries of Louisiana, as\r\nceded to the United States by France, \"are the river Perdido on the east\r\nand the river Bravo on the west,\" and they add that \"the facts and\r\nprinciples which justify this conclusion are so satisfactory to our\r\nGovernment as to convince it that the United States have not a better right\r\nto the island of New Orleans under the cession referred to than they have\r\nto the whole district of territory which is above described.\" Down to the\r\nconclusion of the Florida treaty, in February, 1819, by which this\r\nterritory was ceded to Spain, the United States asserted and maintained\r\ntheir territorial rights to this extent. In the month of June, 1818, during\r\nMr. Monroe's Administration, information having been received that a number\r\nof foreign adventurers had landed at Galveston with the avowed purpose of\r\nforming a settlement in that vicinity, a special messenger was dispatched\r\nby the Government of the United States with instructions from the Secretary\r\nof State to warn them to desist, should they be found there, \"or any other\r\nplace north of the Rio Bravo, and within the territory claimed by the\r\nUnited States.\" He was instructed, should they be found in the country\r\nnorth of that river, to make known to them \"the surprise with which the\r\nPresident has seen possession thus taken, without authority from the United\r\nStates, of a place within their territorial limits, and upon which no\r\nlawful settlement can be made without their sanction.\" He was instructed to\r\ncall upon them to \"avow under what national authority they profess to act,\"\r\nand to give them due warning \"that the place is within the United States,\r\nwho will suffer no permanent settlement to be made there under any\r\nauthority other than their own.\" As late as the 8th of July, 1842, the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States, in a note addressed to our\r\nminister in Mexico, maintains that by the Florida treaty of 1819 the\r\nterritory as far west as the Rio Grande was confirmed to Spain. In that\r\nnote he states that--\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of the 22d of February, 1819, between the United States and\r\nSpain, the Sabine was adopted as the line of boundary between the two\r\npowers. Up to that period no considerable colonization had been effected in\r\nTexas; but the territory between the Sabine and the Rio Grande being\r\nconfirmed to Spain by the treaty, applications were made to that power for\r\ngrants of land, and such grants or permissions of settlement were in fact\r\nmade by the Spanish authorities in favor of citizens of the United States\r\nproposing to emigrate to Texas in numerous families before the declaration\r\nof independence by Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Texas which was ceded to Spain by the Florida treaty of 1819 embraced\r\nall the country now claimed by the State of Texas between the Nueces and\r\nthe Rio Grande. The Republic of Texas always claimed this river as her\r\nwestern boundary, and in her treaty made with Santa Anna in May, 1836, he\r\nrecognized it as such. By the constitution which Texas adopted in March,\r\n1836, senatorial and representative districts were organized extending west\r\nof the Nueces. The Congress of Texas on the 19th of December, 1836, passed\r\n\"An act to define the boundaries of the Republic of Texas,\" in which they\r\ndeclared the Rio Grande from its mouth to its source to be their boundary,\r\nand by the said act they extended their \"civil and political jurisdiction\"\r\nover the country up to that boundary. During a period of more than nine\r\nyears which intervened between the adoption of her constitution and her\r\nannexation as one of the States of our Union Texas asserted and exercised\r\nmany acts of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the territory and\r\ninhabitants west of the Nueces. She organized and defined the limits of\r\ncounties extending to the Rio Grande; she established courts of justice and\r\nextended her judicial system over the territory; she established a\r\ncustom-house and collected duties, and also post-offices and post-roads, in\r\nit; she established a land office and issued numerous grants for land\r\nwithin its limits; a senator and a representative residing in it were\r\nelected to the Congress of the Republic and served as such before the act\r\nof annexation took place. In both the Congress and convention of Texas\r\nwhich gave their assent to the terms of annexation to the United States\r\nproposed by our Congress were representatives residing west of the Nueces,\r\nwho took part in the act of annexation itself. This was the Texas which by\r\nthe act of our Congress of the 29th of December, 1845, was admitted as one\r\nof the States of our Union. That the Congress of the United States\r\nunderstood the State of Texas which they admitted into the Union to extend\r\nbeyond the Nueces is apparent from the fact that on the 31st of December,\r\n1845, only two days after the act of admission, they passed a law \"to\r\nestablish a collection district in the State of Texas,\" by which they\r\ncreated a port of delivery at Corpus Christi, situated west of the Nueces,\r\nand being the same point at which the Texas custom-house under the laws of\r\nthat Republic had been located, and directed that a surveyor to collect the\r\nrevenue should be appointed for that port by the President, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate. A surveyor was accordingly nominated, and\r\nconfirmed by the Senate, and has been ever since in the performance of his\r\nduties. All these acts of the Republic of Texas and of our Congress\r\npreceded the orders for the advance of our Army to the east bank of the Rio\r\nGrande. Subsequently Congress passed an act \"establishing certain post\r\nroutes\" extending west of the Nueces. The country west of that river now\r\nconstitutes a part of one of the Congressional districts of Texas and is\r\nrepresented in the House of Representatives. The Senators from that State\r\nwere chosen by a legislature in which the country west of that river was\r\nrepresented. In view of all these facts it is difficult to conceive upon\r\nwhat ground it can be maintained that in occupying the country west of the\r\nNueces with our Army, with a view solely to its security and defense, we\r\ninvaded the territory of Mexico. But it would have been still more\r\ndifficult to justify the Executive, whose duty it is to see that the laws\r\nbe faithfully executed, if in the face of all these proceedings, both of\r\nthe Congress of Texas and of the United States, he had assumed the\r\nresponsibility of yielding up the territory west of the Nueces to Mexico or\r\nof refusing to protect and defend this territory and its inhabitants,\r\nincluding Corpus Christi as well as the remainder of Texas, against the\r\nthreatened Mexican invasion.\r\n\r\nBut Mexico herself has never placed the war which she has waged upon the\r\nground that our Army occupied the intermediate territory between the Nueces\r\nand the Rio Grande. Her refuted pretension that Texas was not in fact an\r\nindependent state, but a rebellious province, was obstinately persevered\r\nin, and her avowed purpose in commencing a war with the United States was\r\nto reconquer Texas and to restore Mexican authority over the whole\r\nterritory--not to the Nueces only, but to the Sabine. In view of the\r\nproclaimed menaces of Mexico to this effect, I deemed it my duty, as a\r\nmeasure of precaution and defense, to order our Army to occupy a position\r\non our frontier as a military post, from which our troops could best resist\r\nand repel any attempted invasion which Mexico might make. Our Army had\r\noccupied a position at Corpus Christi, west of the Nueces, as early as\r\nAugust, 1845, without complaint from any quarter. Had the Nueces been\r\nregarded as the true western boundary of Texas, that boundary had been\r\npassed by our Army many months before it advanced to the eastern bank of\r\nthe Rio Grande. In my annual message of December last I informed Congress\r\nthat upon the invitation of both the Congress and convention of Texas I had\r\ndeemed it proper to order a strong squadron to the coasts of Mexico and to\r\nconcentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of Texas to\r\nprotect and defend the inhabitants against the menaced invasion of Mexico.\r\nIn that message I informed Congress that the moment the terms of annexation\r\noffered by the United States were accepted by Texas the latter became so\r\nfar a part of our own country as to make it our duty to afford such\r\nprotection and defense, and that for that purpose our squadron had been\r\nordered to the Gulf and our Army to take a \"position between the Nueces and\r\nthe Del Norte\" or Rio Grande and to \"repel any invasion of the Texan\r\nterritory which might be attempted by the Mexican forces.\"\r\n\r\nIt was deemed proper to issue this order, because soon after the President\r\nof Texas, in April, 1845, had issued his proclamation convening the\r\nCongress of that Republic for the purpose of submitting to that body the\r\nterms of annexation proposed by the United States the Government of Mexico\r\nmade serious threats of invading the Texan territory. These threats became\r\nmore imposing as it became more apparent in the progress of the question\r\nthat the people of Texas would decide in favor of accepting the terms of\r\nannexation, and finally they had assumed such a formidable character as\r\ninduced both the Congress and convention of Texas to request that a\r\nmilitary force should be sent by the United States into her territory for\r\nthe purpose of protecting and defending her against the threatened\r\ninvasion. It would have been a violation of good faith toward the people of\r\nTexas to have refused to afford the aid which they desired against a\r\nthreatened invasion to which they had been exposed by their free\r\ndetermination to annex themselves to our Union in compliance with the\r\noverture made to them by the joint resolution of our Congress. Accordingly,\r\na portion of the Army was ordered to advance into Texas. Corpus Christi was\r\nthe position selected by General Taylor. He encamped at that place in\r\nAugust, 1845, and the Army remained in that position until the 11th of\r\nMarch, 1846, when it moved westward, and on the 28th of that month reached\r\nthe east bank of the Rio Grande opposite to Matamoras. This movement was\r\nmade in pursuance of orders from the War Department, issued on the 13th of\r\nJanuary, 1846. Before these orders were issued the dispatch of our minister\r\nin Mexico transmitting the decision of the council of government of Mexico\r\nadvising that he should not be received, and also the dispatch of our\r\nconsul residing in the City of Mexico, the former bearing date on the 17th\r\nand the latter on the 18th of December, 1845, copies of both of which\r\naccompanied my message to Congress of the 11th of May last, were received\r\nat the Department of State. These communications rendered it highly\r\nprobable, if not absolutely certain, that our minister would not be\r\nreceived by the Government of General Herrera. It was also well known that\r\nbut little hope could be entertained of a different result from General\r\nParedes in case the revolutionary movement which he was prosecuting should\r\nprove successful, as was highly probable. The partisans of Paredes, as our\r\nminister in the dispatch referred to states, breathed the fiercest\r\nhostility against the United States, denounced the proposed negotiation as\r\ntreason, and openly called upon the troops and the people to put down the\r\nGovernment of Herrera by force. The reconquest of Texas and war with the\r\nUnited States were openly threatened. These were the circumstances existing\r\nwhen it was deemed proper to order the Army under the command of General\r\nTaylor to advance to the western frontier of Texas and occupy a position on\r\nor near the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of a contemplated Mexican invasion have been since fully\r\njustified by the event. The determination of Mexico to rush into\r\nhostilities with the United States was afterwards manifested from the whole\r\ntenor of the note of the Mexican minister of foreign affairs to our\r\nminister bearing date on the 12th of March, 1846. Paredes had then\r\nrevolutionized the Government, and his minister, after referring to the\r\nresolution for the annexation of Texas which had been adopted by our\r\nCongress in March, 1845, proceeds to declare that--\r\n\r\nA fact such as this, or, to speak with greater exactness, so notable an act\r\nof usurpation, created an imperious necessity that Mexico, for her own\r\nhonor, should repel it with proper firmness and dignity. The supreme\r\nGovernment had beforehand declared that it would look upon such an act as a\r\ncasus belli, and as a consequence of this declaration negotiation was by\r\nits very nature at an end, and war was the only recourse of the Mexican\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt appears also that on the 4th of April following General Paredes, through\r\nhis minister of war, issued orders to the Mexican general in command on the\r\nTexan frontier to \"attack\" our Army \"by every means which war permits.\" To\r\nthis General Paredes had been pledged to the army and people of Mexico\r\nduring the military revolution which had brought him into power. On the\r\n18th of April, 1846, General Paredes addressed a letter to the commander on\r\nthat frontier in which he stated to him: \"At the present date I suppose\r\nyou, at the head of that valiant army, either fighting already or preparing\r\nfor the operations of a campaign;\" and, \"Supposing you already on the\r\ntheater of operations and with all the forces assembled, it is\r\nindispensable that hostilities be commenced, yourself taking the initiative\r\nagainst the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe movement of our Army to the Rio Grande was made by the commanding\r\ngeneral under positive orders to abstain from all aggressive acts toward\r\nMexico or Mexican citizens, and to regard the relations between the two\r\ncountries as peaceful unless Mexico should declare war or commit acts of\r\nhostility indicative of a state of war, and these orders he faithfully\r\nexecuted. Whilst occupying his position on the east bank of the Rio Grande,\r\nwithin the limits of Texas, then recently admitted as one of the States of\r\nour Union, the commanding general of the Mexican forces, who, in pursuance\r\nof the orders of his Government, had collected a large army on the opposite\r\nshore of the Rio Grande, crossed the river, invaded our territory, and\r\ncommenced hostilities by attacking our forces. Thus, after all the injuries\r\nwhich we had received and borne from Mexico, and after she had insultingly\r\nrejected a minister sent to her on a mission of peace, and whom she had\r\nsolemnly agreed to receive, she consummated her long course of outrage\r\nagainst our country by commencing an offensive war and shedding the blood\r\nof our citizens on our own soil.\r\n\r\nThe United States never attempted to acquire Texas by conquest. On the\r\ncontrary, at an early period after the people of Texas had achieved their\r\nindependence they sought to be annexed to the United States. At a general\r\nelection in September, 1836, they decided with great unanimity in favor of\r\n\"annexation,\" and in November following the Congress of the Republic\r\nauthorized the appointment of a minister to bear their request to this\r\nGovernment. This Government, however, having remained neutral between Texas\r\nand Mexico during the war between them, and considering it due to the honor\r\nof our country and our fair fame among the nations of the earth that we\r\nshould not at this early period consent to annexation, nor until it should\r\nbe manifest to the whole world that the reconquest of Texas by Mexico was\r\nimpossible, refused to accede to the overtures made by Texas. On the 12th\r\nof April, 1844, after more than seven years had elapsed since Texas had\r\nestablished her independence, a treaty was concluded for the annexation of\r\nthat Republic to the United States, which was rejected by the Senate.\r\nFinally, on the 1st of March, 1845, Congress passed a joint resolution for\r\nannexing her to the United States upon certain preliminary conditions to\r\nwhich her assent was required. The solemnities which characterized the\r\ndeliberations and conduct of the Government and people of Texas on the\r\ndeeply interesting questions presented by these resolutions are known to\r\nthe world. The Congress, the Executive, and the people of Texas, in a\r\nconvention elected for that purpose, accepted with great unanimity the\r\nproposed terms of annexation, and thus consummated on her part the great\r\nact of restoring to our Federal Union a vast territory which had been ceded\r\nto Spain by the Florida treaty more than a quarter of a century before.\r\n\r\nAfter the joint resolution for the annexation of Texas to the United States\r\nhad been passed by our Congress the Mexican minister at Washington\r\naddressed a note to the Secretary of State, bearing date on the 6th of\r\nMarch, 1845, protesting against it as \"an act of aggression the most unjust\r\nwhich can be found recorded in the annals of modern history, namely, that\r\nof despoiling a friendly nation like Mexico of a considerable portion of\r\nher territory,\" and protesting against the resolution of annexation as\r\nbeing an act \"whereby the Province of Texas, an integral portion of the\r\nMexican territory, is agreed and admitted into the American Union;\" and he\r\nannounced that as a consequence his mission to the United States had\r\nterminated, and demanded his passports, which were granted. It was upon the\r\nabsurd pretext, made by Mexico (herself indebted for her independence to a\r\nsuccessful revolution), that the Republic of Texas still continued to be,\r\nnotwithstanding all that had passed, a Province of Mexico that this step\r\nwas taken by the Mexican minister.\r\n\r\nEvery honorable effort has been used by me to avoid the war which followed,\r\nbut all have proved vain. All our attempts to preserve peace have been met\r\nby insult and resistance on the part of Mexico. My efforts to this end\r\ncommenced in the note of the Secretary of State of the 10th of March, 1845,\r\nin answer to that of the Mexican minister. Whilst declining to reopen a\r\ndiscussion which had already been exhausted, and proving again what was\r\nknown to the whole world, that Texas had long since achieved her\r\nindependence, the Secretary of State expressed the regret of this\r\nGovernment that Mexico should have taken offense at the resolution of\r\nannexation passed by Congress, and gave assurance that our \"most strenuous\r\nefforts shall be devoted to the amicable adjustment of every cause of\r\ncomplaint between the two Governments and to the cultivation of the kindest\r\nand most friendly relations between the sister Republics.\" That I have\r\nacted in the spirit of this assurance will appear from the events which\r\nhave since occurred. Notwithstanding Mexico had abruptly terminated all\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with the United States, and ought, therefore, to\r\nhave been the first to ask for its resumption, yet, waiving all ceremony, I\r\nembraced the earliest favorable opportunity \"to ascertain from the Mexican\r\nGovernment whether they would receive an envoy from the United States\r\nintrusted with full power to adjust all the questions in dispute between\r\nthe two Governments.\" In September, 1845, I believed the propitious moment\r\nfor such an overture had arrived. Texas, by the enthusiastic and almost\r\nunanimous will of her people, had pronounced in favor of annexation. Mexico\r\nherself had agreed to acknowledge the independence of Texas, subject to a\r\ncondition, it is true, which she had no right to impose and no power to\r\nenforce. The last lingering hope of Mexico, if she still could have\r\nretained any, that Texas would ever again become one of her Provinces, must\r\nhave been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe consul of the United States at the City of Mexico was therefore\r\ninstructed by the Secretary of State on the 15th of September, 1845, to\r\nmake the inquiry of the Mexican Government. The inquiry was made, and on\r\nthe 15th of October, 1845, the minister of foreign affairs of the Mexican\r\nGovernment, in a note addressed to our consul, gave a favorable response,\r\nrequesting at the same time that our naval force might be withdrawn from\r\nVera Cruz while negotiations should be pending. Upon the receipt of this\r\nnote our naval force was promptly withdrawn from Vera Cruz. A minister was\r\nimmediately appointed, and departed to Mexico. Everything bore a promising\r\naspect for a speedy and peaceful adjustment of all our difficulties. At the\r\ndate of my annual message to Congress in December last no doubt was\r\nentertained but that he would be received by the Mexican Government, and\r\nthe hope was cherished that all cause of misunderstanding between the two\r\ncountries would be speedily removed. In the confident hope that such would\r\nbe the result of his mission, I informed Congress that I forbore at that\r\ntime to \"recommend such ulterior measures of redress for the wrongs and\r\ninjuries we had so long borne as it would have been proper to make had no\r\nsuch negotiation been instituted.\" To my surprise and regret the Mexican\r\nGovernment, though solemnly pledged to do so, upon the arrival of our\r\nminister in Mexico refused to receive and accredit him. When he reached\r\nVera Cruz, on the 30th of November, 1845, he found that the aspect of\r\naffairs had undergone an unhappy change. The Government of General Herrera,\r\nwho was at that time President of the Republic, was tottering to its fall.\r\nGeneral Paredes, a military leader, had manifested his determination to\r\noverthrow the Government of Herrera by a military revolution, and one of\r\nthe principal means which he employed to effect his purpose and render the\r\nGovernment of Herrera odious to the army and people of Mexico was by loudly\r\ncondemning its determination to receive a minister of peace from the United\r\nStates, alleging that it was the intention of Herrera, by a treaty with the\r\nUnited States, to dismember the territory of Mexico by ceding away the\r\ndepartment of Texas. The Government of Herrera is believed to have been\r\nwell disposed to a pacific adjustment of existing difficulties, but\r\nprobably alarmed for its own security, and in order to ward off the danger\r\nof the revolution led by Paredes, violated its solemn agreement and refused\r\nto receive or accredit our minister; and this although informed that he had\r\nbeen invested with full power to adjust all questions in dispute between\r\nthe two Governments. Among the frivolous pretexts for this refusal, the\r\nprincipal one was that our minister had not gone upon a special mission\r\nconfined to the question of Texas alone, leaving all the outrages upon our\r\nflag and our citizens unredressed. The Mexican Government well knew that\r\nboth our national honor and the protection due to our citizens imperatively\r\nrequired that the two questions of boundary and indemnity should be treated\r\nof together, as naturally and inseparably blended, and they ought to have\r\nseen that this course was best calculated to enable the United States to\r\nextend to them the most liberal justice. On the 30th of December, 1845,\r\nGeneral Herrera resigned the Presidency and yielded up the Government to\r\nGeneral Paredes without a struggle. Thus a revolution was accomplished\r\nsolely by the army commanded by Paredes, and the supreme power in Mexico\r\npassed into the hands of a military usurper who was known to be bitterly\r\nhostile to the United States.\r\n\r\nAlthough the prospect of a pacific adjustment with the new Government was\r\nunpromising from the known hostility of its head to the United States, yet,\r\ndetermined that nothing should be left undone on our part to restore\r\nfriendly relations between the two countries, our minister was instructed\r\nto present his credentials to the new Government and ask to be accredited\r\nby it in the diplomatic character in which he had been commissioned. These\r\ninstructions he executed by his note of the 1st of March, 1846, addressed\r\nto the Mexican minister of foreign affairs, but his request was insultingly\r\nrefused by that minister in his answer of the 12th of the same month. No\r\nalternative remained for our minister but to demand his passports and\r\nreturn to the United States.\r\n\r\nThus was the extraordinary spectacle presented to the civilized world of a\r\nGovernment, in violation of its own express agreement, having twice\r\nrejected a minister of peace invested with full powers to adjust all the\r\nexisting differences between the two countries in a manner just and\r\nhonorable to both. I am not aware that modern history presents a parallel\r\ncase in which in time of peace one nation has refused even to hear\r\npropositions from another for terminating existing difficulties between\r\nthem. Scarcely a hope of adjusting our difficulties, even at a remote day,\r\nor of preserving peace with Mexico, could be cherished while Paredes\r\nremained at the head of the Government. He had acquired the supreme power\r\nby a military revolution and upon the most solemn pledges to wage war\r\nagainst the United States and to reconquer Texas, which he claimed as a\r\nrevolted province of Mexico. He had denounced as guilty of treason all\r\nthose Mexicans who considered Texas as no longer constituting a part of the\r\nterritory of Mexico and who were friendly to the cause of peace. The\r\nduration of the war which he waged against the United States was\r\nindefinite, because the end which he proposed of the reconquest of Texas\r\nwas hopeless. Besides, there was good reason to believe from all his\r\nconduct that it was his intention to convert the Republic of Mexico into a\r\nmonarchy and to call a foreign European prince to the throne. Preparatory\r\nto this end, he had during his short rule destroyed the liberty of the\r\npress, tolerating that portion of it only which openly advocated the\r\nestablishment of a monarchy. The better to secure the success of his\r\nultimate designs, he had by an arbitrary decree convoked a Congress, not to\r\nbe elected by the free voice of the people, but to be chosen in a manner to\r\nmake them subservient to his will and to give him absolute control over\r\ntheir deliberations.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances it was believed that any revolution in Mexico\r\nfounded upon opposition to the ambitious projects of Paredes would tend to\r\npromote the cause of peace as well as prevent any attempted European\r\ninterference in the affairs of the North American continent, both objects\r\nof deep interest to the United States. Any such foreign interference, if\r\nattempted, must have been resisted by the United States. My views upon that\r\nsubject were fully communicated to Congress in my last annual message. In\r\nany event, it was certain that no change whatever in the Government of\r\nMexico which would deprive Paredes of power could be for the worse so far\r\nas the United States were concerned, while it was highly probable that any\r\nchange must be for the better. This was the state of affairs existing when\r\nCongress, on the 13th of May last, recognized the existence of the war\r\nwhich had been commenced by the Government of Paredes; and it became an\r\nobject of much importance, with a view to a speedy settlement of our\r\ndifficulties and the restoration of an honorable peace, that Paredes should\r\nnot retain power in Mexico.\r\n\r\nBefore that time there were symptoms of a revolution in Mexico, favored, as\r\nit was understood to be, by the more liberal party, and especially by those\r\nwho were opposed to foreign interference and to the monarchical form of\r\ngovernment. Santa Anna was then in exile in Havana, having been expelled\r\nfrom power and banished from his country by a revolution which occurred in\r\nDecember, 1844; but it was known that he had still a considerable party in\r\nhis favor in Mexico. It was also equally well known that no vigilance which\r\ncould be exerted by our squadron would in all probability have prevented\r\nhim from effecting a landing somewhere on the extensive Gulf coast of\r\nMexico if he desired to return to his country. He had openly professed an\r\nentire change of policy, had expressed his regret that he had subverted the\r\nfederal constitution of 1824, and avowed that he was now in favor of its\r\nrestoration. He had publicly declared his hostility, in strongest terms, to\r\nthe establishment of a monarchy and to European interference in the affairs\r\nof his country. Information to this effect had been received, from sources\r\nbelieved to be reliable, at the date of the recognition of the existence of\r\nthe war by Congress, and was afterwards fully confirmed by the receipt of\r\nthe dispatch of our consul in the City of Mexico, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, which are herewith transmitted. Besides, it was reasonable to\r\nsuppose that he must see the ruinous consequences to Mexico of a war with\r\nthe United States, and that it would be his interest to favor peace.\r\n\r\nIt was under these circumstances and upon these considerations that it was\r\ndeemed expedient not to obstruct his return to Mexico should he attempt to\r\ndo so. Our object was the restoration of peace, and, with that view, no\r\nreason was perceived why we should take part with Paredes and aid him by\r\nmeans of our blockade in preventing the return of his rival to Mexico. On\r\nthe contrary, it was believed that the intestine divisions which ordinary\r\nsagacity could not but anticipate as the fruit of Santa Anna's return to\r\nMexico, and his contest with Paredes, might strongly tend to produce a\r\ndisposition with both parties to restore and preserve peace with the United\r\nStates. Paredes was a soldier by profession and a monarchist in principle.\r\nHe had but recently before been successful in a military revolution, by\r\nwhich he had obtained power. He was the sworn enemy of the United States,\r\nwith which he had involved his country in the existing war. Santa Anna had\r\nbeen expelled from power by the army, was known to be in open hostility to\r\nParedes, and publicly pledged against foreign intervention and the\r\nrestoration of monarchy in Mexico. In view of these facts and circumstances\r\nit was that when orders were issued to the commander of our naval forces in\r\nthe Gulf, on the 13th day of May last, the same day on which the existence\r\nof the war was recognized by Congress, to place the coasts of Mexico under\r\nblockade, he was directed not to obstruct the passage of Santa Anna to\r\nMexico should he attempt to return.\r\n\r\nA revolution took place in Mexico in the early part of August following, by\r\nwhich the power of Paredes was overthrown, and he has since been banished\r\nfrom the country, and is now in exile. Shortly afterwards Santa Anna\r\nreturned. It remains to be seen whether his return may not yet prove to be\r\nfavorable to a pacific adjustment of the existing difficulties, it being\r\nmanifestly his interest not to persevere in the prosecution of a war\r\ncommenced by Paredes to accomplish a purpose so absurd as the reconquest of\r\nTexas to the Sabine. Had Paredes remained in power, it is morally certain\r\nthat any pacific adjustment would have been hopeless.\r\n\r\nUpon the commencement of hostilities by Mexico against the United States\r\nthe indignant spirit of the nation was at once aroused. Congress promptly\r\nresponded to the expectations of the country, and by the act of the 13th of\r\nMay last recognized the fact that war existed, by the act of Mexico,\r\nbetween the United States and that Republic, and granted the means\r\nnecessary for its vigorous prosecution. Being involved in a war thus\r\ncommenced by Mexico, and for the justice of which on our part we may\r\nconfidently appeal to the whole world, I resolved to prosecute it with the\r\nutmost vigor. Accordingly the ports of Mexico on the Gulf and on the\r\nPacific have been placed under blockade and her territory invaded at\r\nseveral important points. The reports from the Departments of War and of\r\nthe Navy will inform you more in detail of the measures adopted in the\r\nemergency in which our country was placed and of the gratifying results\r\nwhich have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe various columns of the Army have performed their duty under great\r\ndisadvantages with the most distinguished skill and courage. The victories\r\nof Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and of Monterey, won against greatly\r\nsuperior numbers and against most decided advantages in other respects on\r\nthe part of the enemy, were brilliant in their execution, and entitle our\r\nbrave officers and soldiers to the grateful thanks of their country. The\r\nnation deplores the loss of the brave officers and men who have gallantly\r\nfallen while vindicating and defending their country's rights and honor.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of pride and satisfaction that our volunteer citizen\r\nsoldiers, who so promptly responded to their country's call, with an\r\nexperience of the discipline of a camp of only a few weeks, have borne\r\ntheir part in the hard-fought battle of Monterey with a constancy and\r\ncourage equal to that of veteran troops and worthy of the highest\r\nadmiration. The privations of long marches through the enemy's country and\r\nthrough a wilderness have been borne without a murmur. By rapid movements\r\nthe Province of New Mexico, with Santa Fe, its capital, has been captured\r\nwithout bloodshed. The Navy has cooperated with the Army and rendered\r\nimportant services; if not so brilliant, it is because the enemy had no\r\nforce to meet them on their own element and because of the defenses which\r\nnature has interposed in the difficulties of the navigation on the Mexican\r\ncoast. Our squadron in the Pacific, with the cooperation of a gallant\r\nofficer of the Army and a small force hastily collected in that distant\r\ncountry, has acquired bloodless possession of the Californias, and the\r\nAmerican flag has been raised at every important point in that Province.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the success which has thus attended our military and\r\nnaval operations. In less than seven months after Mexico commenced\r\nhostilities, at a time selected by herself, we have taken possession of\r\nmany of her principal ports, driven back and pursued her invading army, and\r\nacquired military possession of the Mexican Provinces of New Mexico, New\r\nLeon, Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and the Californias, a territory larger in\r\nextent than that embraced in the original thirteen States of the Union,\r\ninhabited by a considerable population, and much of it more than 1,000\r\nmiles from the points at which we had to collect our forces and commence\r\nour movements. By the blockade the import and export trade of the enemy has\r\nbeen cut off. Well may the American people be proud of the energy and\r\ngallantry of our regular and volunteer officers and soldiers. The events of\r\nthese few months afford a gratifying proof that our country can under any\r\nemergency confidently rely for the maintenance of her honor and the defense\r\nof her rights on an effective force, ready at all times voluntarily to\r\nrelinquish the comforts of home for the perils and privations of the camp.\r\nAnd though such a force may be for the time expensive, it is in the end\r\neconomical, as the ability to command it removes the necessity of employing\r\na large standing army in time of peace, and proves that our people love\r\ntheir institutions and are ever ready to defend and protect them.\r\n\r\nWhile the war was in a course of vigorous and successful prosecution, being\r\nstill anxious to arrest its evils, and considering that after the brilliant\r\nvictories of our arms on the 8th and 9th of May last the national honor\r\ncould not be compromitted by it, another overture was made to Mexico, by my\r\ndirection, on the 27th of July last to terminate hostilities by a peace\r\njust and honorable to both countries. On the 31st of August following the\r\nMexican Government declined to accept this friendly overture, but referred\r\nit to the decision of a Mexican Congress to be assembled in the early part\r\nof the present month. I communicate to you herewith a copy of the letter of\r\nthe Secretary of State proposing to reopen negotiations, of the answer of\r\nthe Mexican Government, and of the reply thereto of the Secretary of\r\nState,\r\n\r\nThe war will continue to be prosecuted with vigor as the best means of\r\nsecuring peace. It is hoped that the decision of the Mexican Congress, to\r\nwhich our last overture has been referred, may result in a speedy and\r\nhonorable peace. With our experience, however, of the unreasonable course\r\nof the Mexican authorities, it is the part of wisdom not to relax in the\r\nenergy of our military operations until the result is made known. In this\r\nview it is deemed important to hold military possession of all the\r\nProvinces which have been taken until a definitive treaty of peace shall\r\nhave been concluded and ratified by the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe war has not been waged with a view to conquest, but, having been\r\ncommenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy's country and will\r\nbe vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable peace,\r\nand thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war, as well as\r\nto our much-injured citizens, who hold large pecuniary demands against\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of nations a conquered country is subject to be governed by the\r\nconqueror during his military possession and until there is either a treaty\r\nof peace or he shall voluntarily withdraw from it. The old civil government\r\nbeing necessarily superseded, it is the right and duty of the conqueror to\r\nsecure his conquest and to provide for the maintenance of civil order and\r\nthe rights of the inhabitants. This right has been exercised and this duty\r\nperformed by our military and naval commanders by the establishment of\r\ntemporary governments in some of the conquered Provinces of Mexico,\r\nassimilating them as far as practicable to the free institutions of our own\r\ncountry. In the Provinces of New Mexico and of the Californias little, if\r\nany, further resistance is apprehended from the inhabitants to the\r\ntemporary governments which have thus, from the necessity of the case and\r\naccording to the laws of war, been established. It may be proper to provide\r\nfor the security of these important conquests by making an adequate\r\nappropriation for the purpose of erecting fortifications and defraying the\r\nexpenses necessarily incident to the maintenance of our possession and\r\nauthority over them.\r\n\r\nNear the close of your last session, for reasons communicated to Congress,\r\nI deemed it important as a measure for securing a speedy peace with Mexico,\r\nthat a sum of money should be appropriated and placed in the power of the\r\nExecutive, similar to that which had been made upon two former occasions\r\nduring the Administration of President Jefferson.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February, 1803, an appropriation of $2,000.000 was made and\r\nplaced at the disposal of the President. Its object is well known. It was\r\nat that time in contemplation to acquire Louisiana from France, and it was\r\nintended to be applied as a part of the consideration which might be paid\r\nfor that territory. On the 13th of February, 1806, the same sum was in like\r\nmanner appropriated, with a view to the purchase of the Floridas from\r\nSpain. These appropriations were made to facilitate negotiations and as a\r\nmeans to enable the President to accomplish the important objects in view.\r\nThough it did not become necessary for the President to use these\r\nappropriations, yet a state of things might have arisen in which it would\r\nhave been highly important for him to do so, and the wisdom of making them\r\ncan not be doubted. It is believed that the measure recommended at your\r\nlast session met with the approbation of decided majorities in both Houses\r\nof Congress. Indeed, in different forms, a bill making an appropriation of\r\n$2,000,000 passed each House, and it is much to be regretted that it did\r\nnot become a law. The reasons which induced me to recommend the measure at\r\nthat time still exist, and I again submit the subject for your\r\nconsideration and suggest the importance of early action upon it. Should\r\nthe appropriation be made and be not needed, it will remain in the\r\nTreasury; should it be deemed proper to apply it in whole or in part, it\r\nwill be accounted for as other public expenditures.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Congress had recognized the existence of the war with\r\nMexico my attention was directed to the danger that privateers might be\r\nfitted out in the ports of Cuba and Porto Rico to prey upon the commerce of\r\nthe United States, and I invited the special attention of the Spanish\r\nGovernment to the fourteenth article of our treaty with that power of the\r\n27th of October, 1795, under which the citizens and subjects of either\r\nnation who shall take commissions or letters of marque to act as privateers\r\nagainst the other \"shall be punished as pirates.\"\r\n\r\nIt affords me pleasure to inform you that I have received assurances from\r\nthe Spanish Government that this article of the treaty shall be faithfully\r\nobserved on its part. Orders for this purpose were immediately transmitted\r\nfrom that Government to the authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico to exert\r\ntheir utmost vigilance in preventing any attempts to fit out privateers in\r\nthose islands against the United States. From the good faith of Spain I am\r\nfully satisfied that this treaty will be executed in its spirit as well as\r\nits letter, whilst the United States will on their part faithfully perform\r\nall the obligations which it imposes on them.\r\n\r\nInformation has been recently received at the Department of State that the\r\nMexican Government has sent to Havana blank commissions to privateers and\r\nblank certificates of naturalization signed by General Salas, the present\r\nhead of the Mexican Government. There is also reason to apprehend that\r\nsimilar documents have been transmitted to other parts of the world. Copies\r\nof these papers, in translation, are herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nAs the preliminaries required by the practice of civilized nations for\r\ncommissioning privateers and regulating their conduct appear not to have\r\nbeen observed, and as these commissions are in blank, to be filled up with\r\nthe names of citizens and subjects of all nations who may be willing to\r\npurchase them, the whole proceeding can only be construed as an invitation\r\nto all the freebooters upon earth who are willing to pay for the privilege\r\nto cruise against American commerce. It will be for our courts of justice\r\nto decide whether under such circumstances these Mexican letters of marque\r\nand reprisal shall protect those who accept them, and commit robberies upon\r\nthe high seas under their authority, from the pains and penalties of\r\npiracy.\r\n\r\nIf the certificates of naturalization thus granted be intended by Mexico to\r\nshield Spanish subjects from the guilt and punishment of pirates under our\r\ntreaty with Spain, they will certainly prove unavailing. Such a subterfuge\r\nwould be but a weak device to defeat the provisions of a solemn treaty.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress should immediately provide by law for the trial\r\nand punishment as pirates of Spanish subjects who, escaping the vigilance\r\nof their Government, shall be found guilty of privateering against the\r\nUnited States. I do not apprehend serious danger from these privateers. Our\r\nNavy will be constantly on the alert to protect our commerce. Besides, in\r\ncase prizes should be made of American vessels, the utmost vigilance will\r\nbe exerted by our blockading squadron to prevent the captors from taking\r\nthem into Mexican ports, and it is not apprehended that any nation will\r\nviolate its neutrality by suffering such prizes to be condemned and sold\r\nwithin its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress should immediately provide by law for granting\r\nletters of marque and reprisal against vessels under the Mexican flag. It\r\nis true that there are but few, if any, commercial vessels of Mexico upon\r\nthe high seas, and it is therefore not probable that many American\r\nprivateers would be fitted out in case a law should pass authorizing this\r\nmode of warfare. It is, notwithstanding, certain that such privateers may\r\nrender good service to the commercial interests of the country by\r\nrecapturing our merchant ships should any be taken by armed vessels under\r\nthe Mexican flag, as well as by capturing these vessels themselves. Every\r\nmeans within our power should be rendered available for the protection of\r\nour commerce.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit a detailed\r\nstatement of the condition of the finances. The imports for the fiscal year\r\nending on the 30th of June last were of the value of $121,691,797, of which\r\nthe amount exported was $11,346,623, leaving the amount retained in the\r\ncountry for domestic consumption $110,345,174. The value of the exports for\r\nthe same period was $113,488,516, of which $102,141,893 consisted of\r\ndomestic productions and $11,346,623 of foreign articles.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the same year were $29,499,247.06, of\r\nwhich there was derived from customs $26,712,667.87, from the sales of\r\npublic lands $2,694,452.48, and from incidental and miscellaneous sources\r\n$92,126.71. The expenditures for the same period were $28,031,114.20, and\r\nthe balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July last was $9,126,439.\r\n08.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt, including Treasury notes, on the 1st of the\r\npresent month was $24,256,494.60, of which the sum of $17,788,799.62 was\r\noutstanding on the 4th of March, 1845, leaving the amount incurred since\r\nthat time $6,467,694.98.\r\n\r\nIn order to prosecute the war with Mexico with vigor and energy, as the\r\nbest means of bringing it to a speedy and honorable termination, a further\r\nloan will be necessary to meet the expenditures for the present and the\r\nnext fiscal year. If the war should be continued until the 30th of June,\r\n1848, being the end of the next fiscal year, it is estimated that an\r\nadditional loan of $23,000,000 will be required. This estimate is made upon\r\nthe assumption that it will be necessary to retain constantly in the\r\nTreasury $4,000,000 to guard against contingencies. If such surplus were\r\nnot required to be retained, then a loan of $19,000,000 would be\r\nsufficient. If, however, Congress should at the present session impose a\r\nrevenue duty on the principal articles now embraced in the free list, it is\r\nestimated that an additional annual revenue of about two millions and a\r\nhalf, amounting, it is estimated, on the 30th of June, 1848, to $4,000,000,\r\nwould be derived from that source, and the loan required would be reduced\r\nby that amount. It is estimated also that should Congress graduate and\r\nreduce the price of such of the public lands as have been long in the\r\nmarket the additional revenue derived from that source would be annually,\r\nfor several years to come, between half a million and a million dollars;\r\nand the loan required may be reduced by that amount also. Should these\r\nmeasures be adopted, the loan required would not probably exceed\r\n$18,000,000 or $19,000,000, leaving in the Treasury a constant surplus of\r\n$4,000,000. The loan proposed, it is estimated, will be sufficient to cover\r\nthe necessary expenditures both for the war and for all other purposes up\r\nto the 30th of June, 1848, and an amount of this loan not exceeding\r\none-half may be required during the present fiscal year, and the greater\r\npart of the remainder during the first half of the fiscal year succeeding.\r\n\r\nIn order that timely notice may be given and proper measures taken to\r\neffect the loan, or such portion of it as may be required, it is important\r\nthat the authority of Congress to make it be given at an early period of\r\nyour present session. It is suggested that the loan should be contracted\r\nfor a period of twenty years, with authority to purchase the stock and pay\r\nit off at an earlier period at its market value out of any surplus which\r\nmay at any time be in the Treasury applicable to that purpose. After the\r\nestablishment of peace with Mexico, it is supposed that a considerable\r\nsurplus will exist, and that the debt may be extinguished in a much shorter\r\nperiod than that for which it may be contracted. The period of twenty\r\nyears, as that for which the proposed loan may be contracted, in preference\r\nto a shorter period, is suggested, because all experience, both at home and\r\nabroad, has shown that loans are effected upon much better terms upon long\r\ntime than when they are reimbursable at short dates.\r\n\r\nNecessary as this measure is to sustain the honor and the interests of the\r\ncountry engaged in a foreign war, it is not doubted but that Congress will\r\npromptly authorize it.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on the 1st July last exceeded $9,000,000,\r\nnotwithstanding considerable expenditures had been made for the war during\r\nthe months of May and June preceding. But for the war the whole public debt\r\ncould and would have been extinguished within a short period; and it was a\r\npart of my settled policy to do so, and thus relieve the people from its\r\nburden and place the Government in a position which would enable it to\r\nreduce the public expenditures to that economical standard which is most\r\nconsistent with the general welfare and the pure and wholesome progress of\r\nour institutions.\r\n\r\nAmong our just causes of complaint against Mexico arising out of her\r\nrefusal to treat for peace, as well before as since the war so unjustly\r\ncommenced on her part, are the extraordinary expenditures in which we have\r\nbeen involved. Justice to our own people will make it proper that Mexico\r\nshould be held responsible for these expenditures.\r\n\r\nEconomy in the public expenditures is at all times a high duty which all\r\npublic functionaries of the Government owe to the people. This duty becomes\r\nthe more imperative in a period of war, when large and extraordinary\r\nexpenditures become unavoidable. During the existence of the war with\r\nMexico all our resources should be husbanded, and no appropriations made\r\nexcept such as are absolutely necessary for its vigorous prosecution and\r\nthe due administration of the Government. Objects of appropriation which in\r\npeace may be deemed useful or proper, but which are not indispensable for\r\nthe public service, may when the country is engaged in a foreign war be\r\nwell postponed to a future period. By the observance of this policy at your\r\npresent session large amounts may be saved to the Treasury and be applied\r\nto objects of pressing and urgent necessity, and thus the creation of a\r\ncorresponding amount of public debt may be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is not meant to recommend that the ordinary and necessary appropriations\r\nfor the support of Government should be withheld; but it is well known that\r\nat every session of Congress appropriations are proposed for numerous\r\nobjects which may or may not be made without materially affecting the\r\npublic interests, and these it is recommended should not be granted.\r\n\r\nThe act passed at your last session \"reducing the duties on imports\" not\r\nhaving gone into operation until the 1st of the present month, there has\r\nnot been time for its practical effect upon the revenue and the business of\r\nthe country to be developed. It is not doubted, however, that the just\r\npolicy which it adopts will add largely to our foreign trade and promote\r\nthe general prosperity. Although it can not be certainly foreseen what\r\namount of revenue it will yield, it is estimated that it will exceed that\r\nproduced by the act of 1842, which it superseded. The leading principles\r\nestablished by it are to levy the taxes with a view to raise revenue and to\r\nimpose them upon the articles imported according to their actual value.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1842, by the excessive rates of duty which it imposed on many\r\narticles, either totally excluded them from importation or greatly reduced\r\nthe amount imported, and thus diminished instead of producing revenue. By\r\nit the taxes were imposed not for the legitimate purpose of raising\r\nrevenue, but to afford advantages to favored classes at the expense of a\r\nlarge majority of their fellow-citizens. Those employed in agriculture,\r\nmechanical pursuits, commerce, and navigation were compelled to contribute\r\nfrom their substance to swell the profits and overgrown wealth of the\r\ncomparatively few who had invested their capital in manufactures. The taxes\r\nwere not levied in proportion to the value of the articles upon which they\r\nwere imposed, but, widely departing from this just rule, the lighter taxes\r\nwere in many cases levied upon articles of luxury and high price and the\r\nheavier taxes on those of necessity and low price, consumed by the great\r\nmass of the people. It was a system the inevitable effect of which was to\r\nrelieve favored classes and the wealthy few from contributing their just\r\nproportion for the support of Government, and to lay the burden on the\r\nlabor of the many engaged in other pursuits than manufactures.\r\n\r\nA system so unequal and unjust has been superseded by the existing law,\r\nwhich imposes duties not for the benefit or injury of classes or pursuits,\r\nbut distributes and, as far as practicable, equalizes the public burdens\r\namong all classes and occupations. The favored classes who under the\r\nunequal and unjust system which has been repealed have heretofore realized\r\nlarge profits, and many of them amassed large fortunes at the expense of\r\nthe many who have been made tributary to them, will have no reason to\r\ncomplain if they shall be required to bear their just proportion of the\r\ntaxes necessary for the support of Government. So far from it, it will be\r\nperceived by an examination of the existing law that discriminations in the\r\nrates of duty imposed within the revenue principle have been retained in\r\ntheir favor. The incidental aid against foreign competition which they\r\nstill enjoy gives them an advantage which no other pursuits possess, but of\r\nthis none others will complain, because the duties levied are necessary for\r\nrevenue. These revenue duties, including freights and charges, which the\r\nimporter must pay before he can come in competition with the home\r\nmanufacturer in our markets, amount on nearly all our leading branches of\r\nmanufacture to more than one-third of the value of the imported article,\r\nand in some cases to almost one-half its value. With such advantages it is\r\nnot doubted that our domestic manufacturers will continue to prosper,\r\nrealizing in well-conducted establishments even greater profits than can be\r\nderived from any other regular business. Indeed, so far from requiring the\r\nprotection of even incidental revenue duties, our manufacturers in several\r\nleading branches are extending their business, giving evidence of great\r\ningenuity and skill and of their ability to compete, with increased\r\nprospect of success, for the open market of the world. Domestic\r\nmanufactures to the value of several millions of dollars, which can not\r\nfind a market at home, are annually exported to foreign countries. With\r\nsuch rates of duty as those established by the existing law the system will\r\nprobably be permanent, and capitalists who are made or shall hereafter make\r\ntheir investments in manufactures will know upon what to rely. The country\r\nwill be satisfied with these rates, because the advantages which the\r\nmanufacturers still enjoy result necessarily from the collection of revenue\r\nfor the support of Government. High protective duties, from their unjust\r\noperation upon the masses of the people, can not fail to give rise to\r\nextensive dissatisfaction and complaint and to constant efforts to change\r\nor repeal them, rendering all investments in manufactures uncertain and\r\nprecarious. Lower and more permanent rates of duty, at the same time that\r\nthey will yield to the manufacturer fair and remunerating profits, will\r\nsecure him against the danger of frequent changes in the system, which can\r\nnot fail to ruinously affect his interests.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the relaxation of the restrictive policy by the United\r\nStates, Great Britain, from whose example we derived the system, has\r\nrelaxed hers. She has modified her corn laws and reduced many other duties\r\nto moderate revenue rates. After ages of experience the statesmen of that\r\ncountry have been constrained by a stern necessity and by a public opinion\r\nhaving its deep foundation in the sufferings and wants of impoverished\r\nmillions to abandon a system the effect of which was to build up immense\r\nfortunes in the hands of the few and to reduce the laboring millions to\r\npauperism and misery. Nearly in the same ratio that labor was depressed\r\ncapital was increased and concentrated by the British protective policy.\r\n\r\nThe evils of the system in Great Britain were at length rendered\r\nintolerable, and it has been abandoned, but not without a severe struggle\r\non the part of the protected and favored classes to retain the unjust\r\nadvantages which they have so long enjoyed. It was to be expected that a\r\nsimilar struggle would be made by the same classes in the United States\r\nwhenever an attempt was made to modify or abolish the same unjust system\r\nhere. The protective policy had been in operation in the United States for\r\na much shorter period, and its pernicious effects were not, therefore, so\r\nclearly perceived and felt. Enough, however, was known of these effects to\r\ninduce its repeal.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange if in the face of the example of Great Britain, our\r\nprincipal foreign customer, and of the evils of a system rendered manifest\r\nin that country by long and painful experience, and in the face of the\r\nimmense advantages which under a more liberal commercial policy we are\r\nalready deriving, and must continue to derive, by supplying her starving\r\npopulation with food, the United States should restore a policy which she\r\nhas been compelled to abandon, and thus diminish her ability to purchase\r\nfrom us the food and other articles which she so much needs and we so much\r\ndesire to sell. By the simultaneous abandonment of the protective policy by\r\nGreat Britain and the United States new and important markets have already\r\nbeen opened for our agricultural and other products, commerce and\r\nnavigation have received a new impulse, labor and trade have been released\r\nfrom the artificial trammels which have so long fettered them, and to a\r\ngreat extent reciprocity in the exchange of commodities has been introduced\r\nat the same time by both countries, and greatly for the benefit of both.\r\nGreat Britain has been forced by the pressure of circumstances at home to\r\nabandon a policy which has been upheld for ages, and to open her markets\r\nfor our immense surplus of breadstuffs, and it is confidently believed that\r\nother powers of Europe will ultimately see the wisdom, if they be not\r\ncompelled by the pauperism and sufferings of their crowded population, to\r\npursue a similar policy.\r\n\r\nOur farmers are more deeply interested in maintaining the just and liberal\r\npolicy of the existing law than any other class of our citizens. They\r\nconstitute a large majority of our population, and it is well known that\r\nwhen they prosper all other pursuits prosper also. They have heretofore not\r\nonly received none of the bounties or favors of Government, but by the\r\nunequal operations of the protective policy have been made by the burdens\r\nof taxation which it imposed to contribute to the bounties which have\r\nenriched others.\r\n\r\nWhen a foreign as well as a home market is opened to them, they must\r\nreceive, as they are now receiving, increased prices for their products.\r\nThey will find a readier sale, and at better prices, for their wheat,\r\nflour, rice, Indian corn, beef, pork, lard, butter, cheese, and other\r\narticles which they produce. The home market alone is inadequate to enable\r\nthem to dispose of the immense surplus of food and other articles which\r\nthey are capable of producing, even at the most reduced prices, for the\r\nmanifest reason that they can not be consumed in the country. The United\r\nStates can from their immense surplus supply not only the home demand, but\r\nthe deficiencies of food required by the whole world.\r\n\r\nThat the reduced production of some of the chief articles of food in Great\r\nBritain and other parts of Europe may have contributed to increase the\r\ndemand for our breadstuffs and provisions is not doubted, but that the\r\ngreat and efficient cause of this increased demand and of increased prices\r\nconsists in the removal of artificial restrictions heretofore imposed is\r\ndeemed to be equally certain. That our exports of food, already increased\r\nand increasing beyond former example under the more liberal policy which\r\nhas been adopted, will be still vastly enlarged unless they be checked or\r\nprevented by a restoration of the protective policy can not be doubted.\r\nThat our commercial and navigating interests will be enlarged in a\r\ncorresponding ratio with the increase of our trade is equally certain,\r\nwhile our manufacturing interests will still be the favored interests of\r\nthe country and receive the incidental protection afforded them by revenue\r\nduties; and more than this they can not justly demand.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December last a tariff of revenue duties based upon\r\nthe principles of the existing law was recommended, and I have seen no\r\nreason to change the opinions then expressed. In view of the probable\r\nbeneficial effects of that law, I recommend that the policy established by\r\nit be maintained. It has but just commenced to operate, and to abandon or\r\nmodify it without giving it a fair trial would be inexpedient and unwise.\r\nShould defects in any of its details be ascertained by actual experience to\r\nexist, these may be hereafter corrected; but until such defects shall\r\nbecome manifest the act should be fairly tested.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted for your consideration whether it may not be proper, as a\r\nwar measure, to impose revenue duties on some of the articles now embraced\r\nin the free list. Should it be deemed proper to impose such duties with a\r\nview to raise revenue to meet the expenses of the war with Mexico or to\r\navoid to that extent the creation of a public debt, they may be repealed\r\nwhen the emergency which gave rise to them shall cease to exist, and\r\nconstitute no part of the permanent policy of the country.\r\n\r\nThe act of the 6th of August last, \"to provide for the better organization\r\nof the Treasury and for the collection, safe-keeping, transfer, and\r\ndisbursement of the public revenue,\" has been carried into execution as\r\nrapidly as the delay necessarily arising out of the appointment of new\r\nofficers, taking and approving their bonds, and preparing and securing\r\nproper places for the safe-keeping of the public money would permit. It is\r\nnot proposed to depart in any respect from the principles or policy on\r\nwhich this great measure is rounded. There are, however, defects in the\r\ndetails of the measure, developed by its practical operation, which are\r\nfully set forth in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which\r\nthe attention of Congress is invited. These defects would impair to some\r\nextent the successful operation of the law at all times, but are especially\r\nembarrassing when the country is engaged in a war, when the expenditures\r\nare greatly increased, when loans are to be effected and the disbursements\r\nare to be made at points many hundred miles distant, in some cases, from\r\nany depository, and a large portion of them in a foreign country. The\r\nmodifications suggested in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury are\r\nrecommended to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I invite your attention to the importance\r\nof establishing a branch of the Mint of the United States at New York.\r\nTwo-thirds of the revenue derived from customs being collected at that\r\npoint, the demand for specie to pay the duties will be large, and a branch\r\nmint where foreign coin and bullion could be immediately converted into\r\nAmerican coin would greatly facilitate the transaction of the public\r\nbusiness, enlarge the circulation of gold and silver, and be at the same\r\ntime a safe depository of the public money.\r\n\r\nThe importance of graduating and reducing the price of such of the public\r\nlands as have been long offered in the market at the minimum rate\r\nauthorized by existing laws, and remain unsold, induces me again to\r\nrecommend the subject to your favorable consideration. Many millions of\r\nacres of these lands have been offered in the market for more than thirty\r\nyears and larger quantities for more than ten or twenty years, and, being\r\nof an inferior quality, they must remain unsalable for an indefinite period\r\nunless the price at which they may be purchased shall be reduced. To place\r\na price upon them above their real value is not only to prevent their sale,\r\nand thereby deprive the Treasury of any income from that source, but is\r\nunjust to the States in which they lie, because it retards their growth and\r\nincrease of population, and because they have no power to levy a tax upon\r\nthem as upon other lands within their limits, held by other proprietors\r\nthan the United States, for the support of their local governments.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effects of the graduation principle have been realized by\r\nsome of the States owning the lands within their limits in which it has\r\nbeen adopted. They have been demonstrated also by the United States acting\r\nas the trustee of the Chickasaw tribe of Indians in the sale of their lands\r\nlying within the States of Mississippi and Alabama. The Chickasaw lands,\r\nwhich would not command in the market the minimum price established by the\r\nlaws of the United States for the sale of their lands, were, in pursuance\r\nof the treaty of 1834 with that tribe, subsequently offered for sale at\r\ngraduated and reduced rates for limited periods. The result was that large\r\nquantities of these lands were purchased which would otherwise have\r\nremained unsold. The lands were disposed of at their real value, and many\r\npersons of limited means were enabled to purchase small tracts, upon which\r\nthey have settled with their families. That similar results would be\r\nproduced by the adoption of the graduation policy by the United States in\r\nall the States in which they are the owners of large bodies of lands which\r\nhave been long in the market can not be doubted. It can not be a sound\r\npolicy to withhold large quantities of the public lands from the use and\r\noccupation of our citizens by fixing upon them prices which experience has\r\nshown they will not command. On the contrary, it is a wise policy to afford\r\nfacilities to our citizens to become the owners at low and moderate rates\r\nof freeholds of their own instead of being the tenants and dependents of\r\nothers. If it be apprehended that these lands if reduced in price would be\r\nsecured in large quantities by speculators or capitalists, the sales may be\r\nrestricted in limited quantities to actual settlers or persons purchasing\r\nfor purposes of cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I submitted for the consideration of Congress the\r\npresent system of managing the mineral lands of the United States, and\r\nrecommended that they should be brought into market and sold upon such\r\nterms and under such restrictions as Congress might prescribe. By the act\r\nof the 11th of July last \"the reserved lead mines and contiguous lands in\r\nthe States of Illinois and Arkansas and Territories of Wisconsin and Iowa\"\r\nwere authorized to be sold. The act is confined in its operation to \"lead\r\nmines and contiguous lands.\" A large portion of the public lands,\r\ncontaining copper and other ores, is represented to be very valuable, and I\r\nrecommend that provision be made authorizing the sale of these lands upon\r\nsuch terms and conditions as from their supposed value may in the judgment\r\nof Congress be deemed advisable, having due regard to the interests of such\r\nof our citizens as may be located upon them.\r\n\r\nIt will be important during your present session to establish a Territorial\r\ngovernment and to extend the jurisdiction and laws of the United States\r\nover the Territory of Oregon. Our laws regulating trade and intercourse\r\nwith the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains should be extended to\r\nthe Pacific Ocean; and for the purpose of executing them and preserving\r\nfriendly relations with the Indian tribes within our limits, an additional\r\nnumber of Indian agencies will be required, and should be authorized by\r\nlaw. The establishment of custom-houses and of post-offices and post-roads\r\nand provision for the transportation of the mail on such routes as the\r\npublic convenience will suggest require legislative authority. It will be\r\nproper also to establish a surveyor-general's office in that Territory and\r\nto make the necessary provision for surveying the public lands and bringing\r\nthem into market. As our citizens who now reside in that distant region\r\nhave been subjected to many hardships, privations, and sacrifices in their\r\nemigration, and by their improvements have enhanced the value of the public\r\nlands in the neighborhood of their settlements, it is recommended that\r\nliberal grants be made to them of such portions of these lands as they may\r\noccupy, and that similar grants or rights of preemption be made to all who\r\nmay emigrate thither within a limited period, prescribed by law.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War contains detailed information relative\r\nto the several branches of the public service connected with that\r\nDepartment. The operations of the Army have been of a satisfactory and\r\nhighly gratifying character. I recommend to your early and favorable\r\nconsideration the measures proposed by the Secretary of War for speedily\r\nfilling up the rank and file of the Regular Army, for its greater\r\nefficiency in the field, and for raising an additional force to serve\r\nduring the war with Mexico.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassment is likely to arise for want of legal provision authorizing\r\ncompensation to be made to the agents employed in the several States and\r\nTerritories to pay the Revolutionary and other pensioners the amounts\r\nallowed them by law. Your attention is invited to the recommendations of\r\nthe Secretary of War on this subject. These agents incur heavy\r\nresponsibilities and perform important duties, and no reason exists why\r\nthey should not be placed on the same footing as to compensation with other\r\ndisbursing officers.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the various Indian tribes continue to be of a pacific\r\ncharacter. The unhappy dissensions which have existed among the Cherokees\r\nfor many years past have been healed. Since my last annual message\r\nimportant treaties have been negotiated with some of the tribes, by which\r\nthe Indian title to large tracts of valuable land within the limits of the\r\nStates and Territories has been extinguished and arrangements made for\r\nremoving them to the country west of the Mississippi. Between 3,000 and\r\n4,000 of different tribes have been removed to the country provided for\r\nthem by treaty stipulations, and arrangements have been made for others to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIn our intercourse with the several tribes particular attention has been\r\ngiven to the important subject of education. The number of schools\r\nestablished among them has been increased, and additional means provided\r\nnot only for teaching them the rudiments of education, but of instructing\r\nthem in agriculture and the mechanic arts.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a satisfactory\r\nview of the operations of the Department under his charge during the past\r\nyear. It is gratifying to perceive that while the war with Mexico has\r\nrendered it necessary to employ an unusual number of our armed vessels on\r\nher coasts, the protection due to our commerce in other quarters of the\r\nworld has not proved insufficient. No means will be spared to give\r\nefficiency to the naval service in the prosecution of the war; and I am\r\nhappy to know that the officers and men anxiously desire to devote\r\nthemselves to the service of their country in any enterprise, however\r\ndifficult of execution.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the proposition to add to each\r\nof our foreign squadrons an efficient sea steamer, and, as especially\r\ndemanding attention, the establishment at Pensacola of the necessary means\r\nof repairing and refitting the vessels of the Navy employed in the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThere are other suggestions in the report which deserve and I doubt not\r\nwill receive your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe progress and condition of the mail service for the past year are fully\r\npresented in the report of the Postmaster-General. The revenue for the year\r\nending on the 30th of June last amounted to $3,487,199, which is\r\n$802,642.45 less than that of the preceding year. The payments for that\r\nDepartment during the same time amounted to $4,084,297.22. Of this sum\r\n$597,097.80 have been drawn from the Treasury. The disbursements for the\r\nyear were $236,434.77 less than those of the preceding year. While the\r\ndisbursements have been thus diminished, the mail facilities have been\r\nenlarged by new mail routes of 5,739 miles, an increase of transportation\r\nof 1,764,145 miles, and the establishment of 418 new post-offices.\r\nContractors, postmasters, and others engaged in this branch of the service\r\nhave performed their duties with energy and faithfulness deserving\r\ncommendation. For many interesting details connected with the operations of\r\nthis establishment you are referred to the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, and his suggestions for improving its revenues are\r\nrecommended to your favorable consideration. I repeat the opinion expressed\r\nin my last annual message that the business of this Department should be so\r\nregulated that the revenues derived from it should be made to equal the\r\nexpenditures, and it is believed that this may be done by proper\r\nmodifications of the present laws, as suggested in the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, without changing the present rates of postage.\r\n\r\nWith full reliance upon the wisdom and patriotism of your deliberations, it\r\nwill be my duty, as it will be my anxious desire, to cooperate with you in\r\nevery constitutional effort to promote the welfare and maintain the honor\r\nof our common country.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Polk\r\nDecember 7, 1847\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of Congress is always an interesting event. The\r\nrepresentatives of the States and of the people come fresh from their\r\nconstituents to take counsel together for the common good.\r\n\r\nAfter an existence of near three-fourths of a century as a free and\r\nindependent Republic, the problem no longer remains to be solved whether\r\nman is capable of self-government. The success of our admirable system is a\r\nconclusive refutation of the theories of those in other countries who\r\nmaintain that a \"favored few\" are born to rule and that the mass of mankind\r\nmust be governed by force. Subject to no arbitrary or hereditary authority,\r\nthe people are the only sovereigns recognized by our Constitution.\r\n\r\nNumerous emigrants, of every lineage and language, attracted by the civil\r\nand religious freedom we enjoy and by our happy condition, annually crowd\r\nto our shores, and transfer their heart, not less than their allegiance, to\r\nthe country whose dominion belongs alone to the people. No country has been\r\nso much favored, or should acknowledge with deeper reverence the\r\nmanifestations of the divine protection. An all wise Creator directed and\r\nguarded us in our infant struggle for freedom and has constantly watched\r\nover our surprising progress until we have become one of the great nations\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is in a country thus favored, and under a Government in which the\r\nexecutive and legislative branches hold their authority for limited periods\r\nalike from the people, and where all are responsible to their respective\r\nconstituencies, that it is again my duty to communicate with Congress upon\r\nthe state of the Union and the present condition of public affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the most gratifying proofs are presented that our\r\ncountry has been blessed with a widespread and universal prosperity. There\r\nhas been no period since the Government was founded when all the industrial\r\npursuits of our people have been more successful or when labor in all\r\nbranches of business has received a fairer or better reward. From our\r\nabundance we have been enabled to perform the pleasing duty of furnishing\r\nfood for the starving millions of less favored countries.\r\n\r\nIn the enjoyment of the bounties of Providence at home such as have rarely\r\nfallen to the lot of any people, it is cause of congratulation that our\r\nintercourse with all the powers of the earth except Mexico continues to be\r\nof an amicable character.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been our cherished policy to cultivate peace and good will with\r\nall nations, and this policy has been steadily pursued by me. No change has\r\ntaken place in our relations with Mexico since the adjournment of the last\r\nCongress. The war in which the United States were forced to engage with the\r\nGovernment of that country still continues.\r\n\r\nI deem it unnecessary, after the full exposition of them contained in my\r\nmessage of the 11th of May, 1846, and in my annual message at the\r\ncommencement of the session of Congress in December last, to reiterate the\r\nserious causes of complaint which we had against Mexico before she\r\ncommenced hostilities.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient on the present occasion to say that the wanton violation\r\nof the rights of person and property of our citizens committed by Mexico,\r\nher repeated acts of bad faith through a long series of years, and her\r\ndisregard of solemn treaties stipulating for indemnity to our injured\r\ncitizens not only constituted ample cause of war on our part, but were of\r\nsuch an aggravated character as would have justified us before the whole\r\nworld in resorting to this extreme remedy. With an anxious desire to avoid\r\na rupture between the two countries, we forbore for years to assert our\r\nclear rights by force, and continued to seek redress for the wrongs we had\r\nsuffered by amicable negotiation in the hope that Mexico might yield to\r\npacific counsels and the demands of justice. In this hope we were\r\ndisappointed. Our minister of peace sent to Mexico was insultingly\r\nrejected. The Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms of\r\nadjustment which he was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly\r\nunjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war by invading the\r\nterritory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the\r\nblood of our citizens on our own soil.\r\n\r\nThough the United States were the aggrieved nation, Mexico commenced the\r\nwar, and we were compelled in self-defense to repel the invader and to\r\nvindicate the national honor and interests by prosecuting it with vigor\r\nuntil we could obtain a just and honorable peace. On learning that\r\nhostilities had been commenced by Mexico I promptly communicated that fact,\r\naccompanied with a succinct statement of our other causes of complaint\r\nagainst Mexico, to Congress, and that body, by the act of the 13th of May,\r\n1846, declared that \"by the act of the Republic of Mexico a state of war\r\nexists between that Government and the United States.\" This act declaring\r\n\"the war to exist by the act of the Republic of Mexico,\" and making\r\nprovision for its prosecution \"to a speedy and successful termination,\" was\r\npassed with great unanimity by Congress, there being but two negative votes\r\nin the Senate and but fourteen in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the war having thus been declared by Congress, it became\r\nmy duty under the Constitution and the laws to conduct and prosecute it.\r\nThis duty has been performed, and though at every stage of its progress I\r\nhave manifested a willingness to terminate it by a just peace, Mexico has\r\nrefused to accede to any terms which could be accepted by the United States\r\nconsistently with the national honor and interest.\r\n\r\nThe rapid and brilliant successes of our arms and the vast extent of the\r\nenemy's territory which had been overrun and conquered before the close of\r\nthe last session of Congress were fully known to that body. Since that time\r\nthe war has been prosecuted with increased energy, and, I am gratified to\r\nstate, with a success which commands universal admiration.. History\r\npresents no parallel of so many glorious victories achieved by any nation\r\nwithin so short a period. Our Army, regulars and volunteers, have covered\r\nthemselves with imperishable honors. Whenever and wherever our forces have\r\nencountered the enemy, though he was in vastly superior numbers and often\r\nintrenched in fortified positions of his own selection and of great\r\nstrength, he has been defeated. Too much praise can not be bestowed upon\r\nour officers and men, regulars and volunteers, for their gallantry,\r\ndiscipline, indomitable courage, and perseverance, all seeking the post of\r\ndanger and vying with each other in deeds of noble daring.\r\n\r\nWhile every patriot's heart must exult and a just national pride animate\r\nevery bosom in beholding the high proofs of courage, consummate military\r\nskill, steady discipline, and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibited by\r\nour gallant Army, the nation is called to mourn over the loss of many brave\r\nofficers and soldiers, who have fallen in defense of their country's honor\r\nand interests. The brave dead met their melancholy fate in a foreign land,\r\nnobly discharging their duty, and with their country's flag waving\r\ntriumphantly in the face of the foe. Their patriotic deeds are justly\r\nappreciated, and will long be remembered by their grateful countrymen. The\r\nparental care of the Government they loved and served should be extended to\r\ntheir surviving families.\r\n\r\nShortly after the adjournment of the last session of Congress the\r\ngratifying intelligence was received of the signal victory of Buena Vista,\r\nand of the fall of the city of Vera Cruz, and with it the strong castle of\r\nSan Juan de Ulloa, by which it was defended. Believing that after these and\r\nother successes so honorable to our arms and so disastrous to Mexico the\r\nperiod was propitious to afford her another opportunity, if she thought\r\nproper to embrace it, to enter into negotiations for peace, a commissioner\r\nwas appointed to proceed to the headquarters of our Army with full powers\r\nto enter upon negotiations and to conclude a just and honorable treaty of\r\npeace. He was not directed to make any new overtures of peace, but was the\r\nbearer of a dispatch from the Secretary of State of the United States to\r\nthe minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, in reply to one received from\r\nthe latter of the 22d of February, 1847, in which the Mexican Government\r\nwas informed of his appointment and of his presence at the headquarters of\r\nour Army, and that he was invested with full powers to conclude a\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace whenever the Mexican Government might signify a\r\ndesire to do so. While I was unwilling to subject the United States to\r\nanother indignant refusal, I was yet resolved that the evils of the war\r\nshould not be protracted a day longer than might be rendered absolutely\r\nnecessary by the Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nCare was taken to give no instructions to the commissioner which could in\r\nany way interfere with our military operations or relax our energies in the\r\nprosecution of the war. He possessed no authority in any manner to control\r\nthese operations. He was authorized to exhibit his instructions to the\r\ngeneral in command of the Army, and in the event of a treaty being\r\nconcluded and ratified on the part of Mexico he was directed to give him\r\nnotice of that fact. On the happening of such contingency, and on receiving\r\nnotice thereof, the general in command was instructed by the Secretary of\r\nWar to suspend further active military operations until further orders.\r\nThese instructions were given with a view to intermit hostilities until the\r\ntreaty thus ratified by Mexico could be transmitted to Washington and\r\nreceive the action of the Government of the United States. The commissioner\r\nwas also directed on reaching the Army to deliver to the general in command\r\nthe dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of State to the minister of\r\nforeign affairs of Mexico, and on receiving it the general was instructed\r\nby the Secretary of War to cause it to be transmitted to the commander of\r\nthe Mexican forces, with a quest that it might be communicated to his\r\nGovernment. The commissioner did not reach the headquarters of the Army\r\nuntil after another brilliant victory had crowned our arms at Cerro Gordo.\r\nThe dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of War to the general in\r\ncommand of the Army was received by that officer, then at Jalapa, on the\r\n7th of May, 1847, together with the dispatch from the Secretary of State to\r\nthe minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, having been transmitted to him\r\nfrom Vera Cruz. The commissioner arrived at the headquarters of the Army a\r\nfew days afterwards. His presence with the Army and his diplomatic\r\ncharacter were made known to the Mexican Government from Puebla on the 12th\r\nof June, 1847, by the transmission of the dispatch from the Secretary of\r\nState to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMany weeks elapsed after its receipt, and no overtures were made nor was\r\nany desire expressed by the Mexican Government to enter into negotiations\r\nfor peace.\r\n\r\nOur Army pursued its march upon the capital, and as it approached it was\r\nmet by formidable resistance. Our forces first encountered the enemy, and\r\nachieved signal victories in the severely contested battles of Contreras\r\nand Churubusco. It was not until after these actions had resulted in\r\ndecisive victories and the capital of the enemy was within our power that\r\nthe Mexican Government manifested any disposition to enter into\r\nnegotiations for peace, and even then, as events have proved, there is too\r\nmuch reason to believe they were insincere, and that in agreeing to go\r\nthrough the forms of negotiation the object was to gain time to strengthen\r\nthe defenses of their capital and to prepare for fresh resistance.\r\n\r\nThe general in command of the Army deemed it expedient to suspend\r\nhostilities temporarily by entering into an armistice with a view to the\r\nopening of negotiations. Commissioners were appointed on the part of Mexico\r\nto meet the commissioner on the part of the United States. The result of\r\nthe conferences which took place between these functionaries of the two\r\nGovernments was a failure to conclude a treaty of peace. The commissioner\r\nof the United States took with him the project of a treaty already\r\nprepared, by the terms of which the indemnity required by the United States\r\nwas a cession of territory.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the only indemnity which it is in the power of Mexico\r\nto make in satisfaction of the just and long-deferred claims of our\r\ncitizens against her and the only means by which she can reimburse the\r\nUnited States for the expenses of the war is a cession to the United States\r\nof a portion of her territory. Mexico has no money to pay, and no other\r\nmeans of making the required indemnity. If we refuse this, we can obtain\r\nnothing else. To reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of\r\nterritory would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the war,\r\nbearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object.\r\n\r\nA state of war abrogates treaties previously existing between the\r\nbelligerents and a treaty of peace puts an end to all claims for indemnity\r\nfor tortious acts committed under the authority of one government against\r\nthe citizens or subjects of another unless they are provided for in its\r\nstipulations. A treaty of peace which would terminate the existing war\r\nwithout providing for indemnity would enable Mexico, the acknowledged\r\ndebtor and herself the aggressor in the war, to relieve herself from her\r\njust liabilities. By such a treaty our citizens who hold just demands\r\nagainst her would have no remedy either against Mexico or their own\r\nGovernment. Our duty to these citizens must forever prevent such a peace,\r\nand no treaty which does not provide ample means of discharging these\r\ndemands can receive my sanction.\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace should settle all existing differences between the two\r\ncountries. If an adequate cession of territory should be made by such a\r\ntreaty, the United States should release Mexico from all her liabilities\r\nand assume their payment to our own citizens. If instead of this the United\r\nStates were to consent to a treaty by which Mexico should again engage to\r\npay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to our\r\nGovernment and our citizens would impose on her, it is notorious that she\r\ndoes not possess the means to meet such an undertaking. From such a treaty\r\nno result could be anticipated but the same irritating disappointments\r\nwhich have heretofore attended the violations of similar treaty\r\nstipulations on the part of Mexico. Such a treaty would be but a temporary\r\ncessation of hostilities, without the restoration of the friendship and\r\ngood understanding which should characterize the future intercourse between\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nThat Congress contemplated the acquisition of territorial indemnity when\r\nthat body made provision for the prosecution of the war is obvious.\r\nCongress could not have meant when, in May, 1846, they appropriated\r\n$10,000,000 and authorized the President to employ the militia and naval\r\nand military forces of the United States and to accept the services of\r\n50,000 volunteers to enable him to prosecute the war, and when, at their\r\nlast session, and after our Army had invaded Mexico, they made additional\r\nappropriations and authorized the raising of additional troops for the same\r\npurpose, that no indemnity was to be obtained from Mexico at the conclusion\r\nof the war; and yet it was certain that if no Mexican territory was\r\nacquired no indemnity could be obtained. It is further manifest that\r\nCongress contemplated territorial indemnity from the fact that at their\r\nlast session an act was passed, upon the Executive recommendation,\r\nappropriating $3,000,000 with that express object. This appropriation was\r\nmade \"to enable the President to conclude a treaty of peace, limits, and\r\nboundaries with the Republic of Mexico, to be used by him in the event that\r\nsaid treaty, when signed by the authorized agents of the two Governments\r\nand duly ratified by Mexico, shall call for the expenditure of the same or\r\nany part thereof.\" The object of asking this appropriation was distinctly\r\nstated in the several messages on the subject which I communicated to\r\nCongress. Similar appropriations made in 1803 and 1806, which were referred\r\nto, were intended to be applied in part consideration for the cession of\r\nLouisiana and the Floridas. In like manner it was anticipated that in\r\nsettling the terms of a treaty of \"limits and boundaries\" with Mexico a\r\ncession of territory estimated to be of greater value than the amount of\r\nour demands against her might be obtained, and that the prompt payment of\r\nthis sum in part consideration for the territory ceded, on the conclusion\r\nof a treaty and its ratification on her part, might be an inducement with\r\nher to make such a cession of territory as would be satisfactory to the\r\nUnited States; and although the failure to conclude such a treaty has\r\nrendered it unnecessary to use any part of the $3,000,000 appropriated by\r\nthat act, and the entire sum remains in the Treasury, it is still\r\napplicable to that object should the contingency occur making such\r\napplication proper.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of no territory is the doctrine of no indemnity, and if\r\nsanctioned would be a public acknowledgment that our country was wrong and\r\nthat the war declared by Congress with extraordinary unanimity was unjust\r\nand should be abandoned--an admission unfounded in fact and degrading to\r\nthe national character.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the treaty proposed by the United States were not only just to\r\nMexico, but, considering the character and amount of our claims, the\r\nunjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostilities by her, the\r\nexpenses of the war to which we have been subjected, and the success which\r\nhad attended our arms, were deemed to be of a most liberal character.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner of the United States was authorized to agree to the\r\nestablishment of the Rio Grande as the boundary from its entrance into the\r\nGulf to its intersection with the southern boundary of New Mexico, in north\r\nlatitude about 32 degree, and to obtain a cession to the United States of\r\nthe Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias and the privilege of the\r\nright of way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The boundary of the Rio\r\nGrande and the cession to the United States of New Mexico and Upper\r\nCalifornia constituted an ultimatum which our commissioner was under no\r\ncircumstances to yield.\r\n\r\nThat it might be manifest, not only to Mexico, but to all other nations,\r\nthat the United States were not disposed to take advantage of a feeble\r\npower by insisting upon wrestling from her all the other Provinces,\r\nincluding many of her principal towns and cities, which we had conquered\r\nand held in our military occupation but were willing to conclude a treaty\r\nin a spirit of liberality, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for\r\nthe restoration to Mexico of all our other conquests.\r\n\r\nAs the territory to be acquired by the boundary proposed might be estimated\r\nto be of greater value than a fair equivalent for our just demands, our\r\ncommissioner was authorized to stipulate for the payment of such additional\r\npecuniary consideration as was deemed reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe terms of a treaty proposed by the Mexican commissioners were wholly\r\ninadmissible. They negotiated as if Mexico were the victorious, and not the\r\nvanquished, party. They must have known that their ultimatum could never be\r\naccepted. It required the United States to dismember Texas by surrendering\r\nto Mexico that part of the territory of that State lying between the Nueces\r\nand the Rio Grande, included within her limits by her laws when she was an\r\nindependent republic, and when she was annexed to the United States and\r\nadmitted by Congress as one of the States of our Union. It contained no\r\nprovision for the payment by Mexico of the just claims of our citizens. It\r\nrequired indemnity to Mexican citizens for injuries they may have sustained\r\nby our troops in the prosecution of the war. It demanded the right for\r\nMexico to levy and collect the Mexican tariff of duties on goods imported\r\ninto her ports while in our military occupation during the war, and the\r\nowners of which had paid to officers of the United States the military\r\ncontributions which had been levied upon them; and it offered to cede to\r\nthe United States, for a pecuniary consideration, that part of Upper\r\nCalifornia lying north of latitude 37°. Such were the unreasonable\r\nterms proposed by the Mexican commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe cession to the United States by Mexico of the Provinces of New Mexico\r\nand the Californias, as proposed by the commissioner of the United States,\r\nit was believed would be more in accordance with the convenience and\r\ninterests of both nations than any other cession of territory which it was\r\nprobable Mexico could be induced to make.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest to all who have observed the actual condition of the Mexican\r\nGovernment for some years past and at present that if these Provinces\r\nshould be retained by her she could not long continue to hold and govern\r\nthem. Mexico is too feeble a power to govern these Provinces, lying as they\r\ndo at a distance of more than 1,000 miles from her capital, and if\r\nattempted to be retained by her they would constitute but for a short time\r\neven nominally a part of her dominions. This would be especially the case\r\nwith Upper California.\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of powerful European nations has long since directed their\r\nattention to the commercial importance of that Province, and there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the moment the United States shall relinquish their\r\npresent occupation of it and their claim to it as indemnity an effort would\r\nbe made by some foreign power to possess it, either by conquest or by\r\npurchase. If no foreign government should acquire it in either of these\r\nmodes, an independent revolutionary government would probably be\r\nestablished by the inhabitants and such foreigners as may remain in or\r\nremove to the country as soon as it shall be known that the United States\r\nhave abandoned it. Such a government would be too feeble long to maintain\r\nits separate independent existence, and would finally become annexed to or\r\nbe a dependent colony of some more powerful state. Should any foreign\r\ngovernment attempt to possess it as a colony, or otherwise to incorporate\r\nit with itself, the principle avowed by President Monroe in 1824, and\r\nreaffirmed in my first annual message, that no foreign power shall with our\r\nconsent be permitted to plant or establish any new colony or dominion on\r\nany part of the North American continent must be maintained. In maintaining\r\nthis principle and in resisting its invasion by any foreign power we might\r\nbe involved in other wars more expensive and more difficult than that in\r\nwhich we are now engaged. The Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias\r\nare contiguous to the territories of the United States, and if brought\r\nunder the government of our laws their resources--mineral, agricultural,\r\nmanufacturing, and commercial--would soon be developed.\r\n\r\nUpper California is bounded on the north by our Oregon possessions, and if\r\nheld by the United States would soon be settled by a hardy, enterprising,\r\nand intelligent portion of our population. The Bay of San Francisco and\r\nother harbors along the Californian coast would afford shelter for our\r\nNavy, for our numerous whale ships, and other merchant vessels employed in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, and would in a short period become the marts of an\r\nextensive and profitable commerce with China and other countries of the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThese advantages, in which the whole commercial world would participate,\r\nwould at once be secured to the United States by the cession of this\r\nterritory; while it is certain that as long as it remains a part of the\r\nMexican dominions they can be enjoyed neither by Mexico herself nor by any\r\nother nation.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is a frontier Province, and has never been of any considerable\r\nvalue to Mexico. From its locality it is naturally connected with our\r\nWestern settlements. The territorial limits of the State of Texas, too, as\r\ndefined by her laws before her admission into our Union, embrace all that\r\nportion of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande, while Mexico still\r\nclaims to hold this territory as a part of her dominions. The adjustment of\r\nthis question of boundary is important.\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration which induced the belief that the Mexican\r\nGovernment might even desire to place this Province under the protection of\r\nthe Government of the United States. Numerous bands of fierce and warlike\r\nsavages wander over it and upon its borders. Mexico has been and must\r\ncontinue to be too feeble to restrain them from committing depredations,\r\nrobberies, and murders, not only upon the inhabitants of New Mexico itself,\r\nbut upon those of the other northern States of Mexico. It would be a\r\nblessing to all these northern States to have their citizens protected\r\nagainst them by the power of the United States. At this moment many\r\nMexicans, principally females and children, are in captivity among them. If\r\nNew Mexico were held and governed by the United States, we could\r\neffectually prevent these tribes from committing such outrages, and compel\r\nthem to release these captives and restore them to their families and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIn proposing to acquire New Mexico and the Californias, it was known that\r\nbut an inconsiderable portion of the Mexican people would be transferred\r\nwith them, the country embraced within these Provinces being chiefly an\r\nuninhabited region.\r\n\r\nThese were the leading considerations which induced me to authorize the\r\nterms of peace which were proposed to Mexico. They were rejected, and,\r\nnegotiations being at an end, hostilities were renewed. An assault was made\r\nby our gallant Army upon the strongly fortified places near the gates of\r\nthe City of Mexico and upon the city itself, and after several days of\r\nsevere conflict the Mexican forces, vastly superior in number to our own,\r\nwere driven from the city, and it was occupied by our troops.\r\n\r\nImmediately after information was received of the unfavorable result of the\r\nnegotiations, believing that his continued presence with the Army could be\r\nproductive of no good, I determined to recall our commissioner. A dispatch\r\nto this effect was transmitted to him on the 6th of October last. The\r\nMexican Government will be informed of his recall, and that in the existing\r\nstate of things I shall not deem it proper to make any further overtures of\r\npeace, but shall be at all times ready to receive and consider any\r\nproposals which may be made by Mexico.\r\n\r\nSince the liberal proposition of the United States was authorized to be\r\nmade, in April last, large expenditures have been incurred and the precious\r\nblood of many of our patriotic fellow-citizens has been shed in the\r\nprosecution of the war. This consideration and the obstinate perseverance\r\nof Mexico in protracting the war must influence the terms of peace which it\r\nmay be deemed proper hereafter to accept. Our arms having been everywhere\r\nvictorious, having subjected to our military occupation a large portion of\r\nthe enemy's country, including his capital, and negotiations for peace\r\nhaving failed, the important questions arise, in what manner the war ought\r\nto be prosecuted and what should be our future policy. I can not doubt that\r\nwe should secure and render available the conquests which we have already\r\nmade, and that with this view we should hold and occupy by our naval and\r\nmilitary forces all the ports, towns, cities, and Provinces now in our\r\noccupation or which may hereafter fall into our possession; that we should\r\npress forward our military operations and levy such military contributions\r\non the enemy as may, as far as practicable, defray the future expenses of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nHad the Government of Mexico acceded to the equitable and liberal terms\r\nproposed, that mode of adjustment would have been preferred, Mexico having\r\ndeclined to do this and failed to offer any other terms which could be\r\naccepted by the United States, the national honor, no less than the public\r\ninterests, requires that the war should be prosecuted with increased energy\r\nand power until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtained. In the\r\nmeantime, as Mexico refuses all indemnity, we should adopt measures to\r\nindemnify ourselves by appropriating permanently a portion of her\r\nterritory. Early after the commencement of the war New Mexico and the\r\nCalifornias were taken possession of by our forces. Our military and naval\r\ncommanders were ordered to conquer and hold them, subject to be disposed of\r\nby a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThese Provinces are now in our undisputed occupation, and have been so for\r\nmany months, all resistance on the part of Mexico having ceased within\r\ntheir limits. I am satisfied that they should never be surrendered to\r\nMexico. Should Congress concur with me in this opinion, and that they\r\nshould be retained by the United States as indemnity, I can perceive no\r\ngood reason why the civil jurisdiction and laws of the United States should\r\nnot at once be extended over them. To wait for a treaty of peace such as we\r\nare willing to make, by which our relations toward them would not be\r\nchanged, can not be good policy; whilst our own interest and that of the\r\npeople inhabiting them require that a stable, responsible, and free\r\ngovernment under our authority should as soon as possible be established\r\nover them. Should Congress, therefore, determine to hold these Provinces\r\npermanently, and that they shall hereafter be considered as constituent\r\nparts of our country, the early establishment of Territorial governments\r\nover them will be important for the more perfect protection of persons and\r\nproperty; and I recommend that such Territorial governments be established.\r\nIt will promote peace and tranquillity among the inhabitants, by allaying\r\nall apprehension that they may still entertain of being again subjected to\r\nthe jurisdiction of Mexico. I invite the early and favorable consideration\r\nof Congress to this important subject.\r\n\r\nBesides New Mexico and the Californias, there are other Mexican Provinces\r\nwhich have been reduced to our possession by conquest. These other Mexican\r\nProvinces are now governed by our military and naval commanders under the\r\ngeneral authority which is conferred upon a conqueror by the laws of war.\r\nThey should continue to be held, as a means of coercing Mexico to accede to\r\njust terms of peace. Civil as well as military officers are required to\r\nconduct such a government. Adequate compensation, to be drawn from\r\ncontributions levied on the enemy, should be fixed by law for such officers\r\nas may be thus employed. What further provision may become necessary and\r\nwhat final disposition it may be proper to make of them must depend on the\r\nfuture progress of the war and the course which Mexico may think proper\r\nhereafter to pursue.\r\n\r\nWith the views I entertain I can not favor the policy which has been\r\nsuggested, either to withdraw our Army altogether or to retire to a\r\ndesignated line and simply hold and defend it. To withdraw our Army\r\naltogether from the conquests they have made by deeds of unparalleled\r\nbravery, and at the expense of so much blood and treasure, in a just war on\r\nour part, and one which, by the act of the enemy, we could not honorably\r\nhave avoided, would be to degrade the nation in its own estimation and in\r\nthat of the world. To retire to a line and simply hold and defend it would\r\nnot terminate the war. On the contrary, it would encourage Mexico to\r\npersevere and tend to protract it indefinitely. It is not to be expected\r\nthat Mexico, after refusing to establish such a line as a permanent\r\nboundary when our victorious Army are in possession of her capital and in\r\nthe heart of her country, would permit us to hold it without resistance.\r\nThat she would continue the war, and in the most harassing and annoying\r\nforms, there can be no doubt. A border warfare of the most savage\r\ncharacter, extending over a long line, would be unceasingly waged. It would\r\nrequire a large army to be kept constantly in the field, stationed at posts\r\nand garrisons along such a line, to protect and defend it. The enemy,\r\nrelieved from the pressure of our arms on his coasts and in the populous\r\nparts of the interior, would direct his attention to this line, and,\r\nselecting an isolated post for attack, would concentrate his forces upon\r\nit. This would be a condition of affairs which the Mexicans, pursuing their\r\nfavorite system of guerrilla warfare, would probably prefer to any other.\r\nWere we to assume a defensive attitude on such a line, all the advantages\r\nof such a state of war would be on the side of the enemy. We could levy no\r\ncontributions upon him, or in any other way make him feel the pressure of\r\nthe war, but must remain inactive and await his approach, being in constant\r\nuncertainty at what point on the line or at what time he might make an\r\nassault. He may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the interior\r\non his own side of the line, and, concealing his purpose, make a sudden\r\nassault upon some one of our posts so distant from any other as to prevent\r\nthe possibility of timely succor or reenforcements, and in this way our\r\ngallant Army would be exposed to the danger of being cut off in detail; or\r\nif by their unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere exhibited during this\r\nwar they should repulse the enemy, their numbers stationed at any one post\r\nmay be too small to pursue him. If the enemy be repulsed in one attack, he\r\nwould have nothing to do but to retreat to his own side of the line, and,\r\nbeing in no fear of a pursuing army, may reenforce himself at leisure for\r\nanother attack on the same or some other post. He may, too, cross the line\r\nbetween our posts, make rapid incursions into the country which we hold,\r\nmurder the inhabitants, commit depredations on them, and then retreat to\r\nthe interior before a sufficient force can be concentrated to pursue him.\r\nSuch would probably be the harassing character of a mere defensive war on\r\nour part. If our forces when attacked, or threatened with attack, be\r\npermitted to cross the line, drive back the enemy, and conquer him, this\r\nwould be again to invade the enemy's country after having lost all the\r\nadvantages of the conquests we have already made by having voluntarily\r\nabandoned them. To hold such a line successfully and in security it is far\r\nfrom being certain that it would not require as large an army as would be\r\nnecessary to hold all the conquests we have already made and to continue\r\nthe prosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy's country. It is also\r\nfar from being certain that the expenses of the war would be diminished by\r\nsuch a policy. I am persuaded that the best means of vindicating the\r\nnational honor and interest and of bringing the war to an honorable close\r\nwill be to prosecute it with increased energy and power in the vital parts\r\nof the enemy's country.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to Congress of December last I declared that--\r\n\r\nThe war has not been waged with a view to conquest, but, having been\r\ncommenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy's country and will\r\nbe vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable peace,\r\nand thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war, as well as\r\nto our much-injured citizens, who hold large pecuniary demands against\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nSuch, in my judgment, continues to be our true policy; indeed, the only\r\npolicy which will probably secure a permanent peace.\r\n\r\nIt has never been contemplated by me, as an object of the war, to make a\r\npermanent conquest of the Republic of Mexico or to annihilate her separate\r\nexistence as an independent nation. On the contrary, it has ever been my\r\ndesire that she should maintain her nationality, and under a good\r\ngovernment adapted to her condition be a free, independent, and prosperous\r\nRepublic. The United States were the first among the nations to recognize\r\nher independence, and have always desired to be on terms of amity and good\r\nneighborhood with her. This she would not suffer. By her own conduct we\r\nhave been compelled to engage in the present war. In its prosecution we\r\nseek not her overthrow as a nation, but in vindicating our national honor\r\nwe seek to obtain redress for the wrongs she has done us and indemnity for\r\nour just demands against her. We demand an honorable peace, and that peace\r\nmust bring with it indemnity for the past and security for the future.\r\nHitherto Mexico has refused all accommodation by which such a peace could\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nWhilst our armies have advanced from victory to victory from the\r\ncommencement of the war, it has always been with the olive branch of peace\r\nin their hands, and it has been in the power of Mexico at every step to\r\narrest hostilities by accepting it.\r\n\r\nOne great obstacle to the attainment of peace has undoubtedly arisen from\r\nthe fact that Mexico has been so long held in subjection by one faction or\r\nmilitary usurper after another, and such has been the condition of\r\ninsecurity in which their successive governments have been placed that each\r\nhas been deterred from making peace lest for this very cause a rival\r\nfaction might expel it from power. Such was the fate of President Herrera's\r\nadministration in 1845 for being disposed even to listen to the overtures\r\nof the United States to prevent the war, as is fully confirmed by an\r\nofficial correspondence which took place in the month of August last\r\nbetween him and his Government, a copy of which is herewith communicated.\r\n\"For this cause alone the revolution which displaced him from power was set\r\non foot\" by General Paredes. Such may be the condition of insecurity of the\r\npresent Government.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the peaceable and well-disposed inhabitants of\r\nMexico are convinced that it is the true interest of their country to\r\nconclude an honorable peace with the United States, but the apprehension of\r\nbecoming the victims of some military faction or usurper may have prevented\r\nthem from manifesting their feelings by any public act. The removal of any\r\nsuch apprehension would probably cause them to speak their sentiments\r\nfreely and to adopt the measures necessary for the restoration of peace.\r\nWith a people distracted and divided by contending factions and a\r\nGovernment subject to constant changes by successive revolutions, the\r\ncontinued successes of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace. In\r\nsuch event it may become proper for our commanding generals in the field to\r\ngive encouragement and assurances of protection to the friends of peace in\r\nMexico in the establishment and maintenance of a free republican government\r\nof their own choice, able and willing to conclude a peace which would be\r\njust to them and secure to us the indemnity we demand. This may become the\r\nonly mode of obtaining such a peace. Should such be the result, the war\r\nwhich Mexico has forced upon us would thus be converted into an enduring\r\nblessing to herself. After finding her torn and distracted by factions, and\r\nruled by military usurpers, we should then leave her with a republican\r\ngovernment in the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and\r\nprosperity, performing all her relative duties in the great family of\r\nnations and promoting her own happiness by wise laws and their faithful\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nIf, after affording this encouragement and protection, and after all the\r\npersevering and sincere efforts we have made from the moment Mexico\r\ncommenced the war, and prior to that time, to adjust our differences with\r\nher, we shall ultimately fail, then we shall have exhausted all honorable\r\nmeans in pursuit of peace, and must continue to occupy her country with our\r\ntroops, taking the full measure of indemnity into our own hands, and must\r\nenforce the terms which our honor demands.\r\n\r\nTo act otherwise in the existing state of things in Mexico, and to withdraw\r\nour Army without a peace, would not only leave all the wrongs of which we\r\ncomplain unredressed, but would be the signal for new and fierce civil\r\ndissensions and new revolutions--all alike hostile to peaceful relations\r\nwith the United States. Besides, there is danger, if our troops were\r\nwithdrawn before a peace was conducted, that the Mexican people, wearied\r\nwith successive revolutions and deprived of protection for their persons\r\nand property, might at length be inclined to yield to foreign influences\r\nand to cast themselves into the arms of some European monarch for\r\nprotection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue. This, for our\r\nown safety and in pursuance of our established policy, we should be\r\ncompelled to resist. We could never consent that Mexico should be thus\r\nconverted into a monarchy governed by a foreign prince.\r\n\r\nMexico is our near neighbor, and her boundaries are coterminous with our\r\nown through the whole extent across the North American continent, from\r\nocean to ocean. Both politically and commercially we have the deepest\r\ninterest in her regeneration and prosperity. Indeed, it is impossible that,\r\nwith any just regard to our own safety, we can ever become indifferent to\r\nher fate.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the Mexican Government and people have misconstrued or\r\nmisunderstood our forbearance and our objects in desiring to conclude an\r\namicable adjustment of the existing differences between the two countries.\r\nThey may have supposed that we would submit to terms degrading to the\r\nnation, or they may have drawn false inferences from the supposed division\r\nof opinion in the United States on the subject of the war, and may have\r\ncalculated to gain much by protracting it, and, indeed, that we might\r\nultimately abandon it altogether without insisting on any indemnity,\r\nterritorial or otherwise. Whatever may be the false impressions under which\r\nthey have acted, the adoption and prosecution of the energetic policy\r\nproposed must soon undeceive them.\r\n\r\nIn the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be made to feel its\r\npressure more than they have heretofore done. At its commencement it was\r\ndeemed proper to conduct it in a spirit of forbearance and liberality. With\r\nthis end in view, early measures were adopted to conciliate, as far as a\r\nstate of war would permit, the mass of the Mexican population; to convince\r\nthem that the war was waged, not against the peaceful inhabitants of\r\nMexico, but against their faithless Government, which had commenced\r\nhostilities; to remove from their minds the false impressions which their\r\ndesigning and interested rulers had artfully attempted to make, that the\r\nwar on our part was one of conquest, that it was a war against their\r\nreligion and their churches, which were to be desecrated and overthrown,\r\nand that their rights of person and private property would be violated. To\r\nremove these false impressions, our commanders in the field were directed\r\nscrupulously to respect their religion, their churches, and their church\r\nproperty, which were in no manner to be violated; they were directed also\r\nto respect the rights of persons and property of all who should not take up\r\narms against us.\r\n\r\nAssurances to this effect were given to the Mexican people by Major General\r\nTaylor in a proclamation issued in pursuance of instructions from the\r\nSecretary of War in the month of June, 1846, and again by Major-General\r\nScott, who acted upon his own convictions of the propriety of issuing it,\r\nin a proclamation of the 11th of May, 1847. In this spirit of liberality\r\nand conciliation, and with a view to prevent the body of the Mexican\r\npopulation from taking up arms against us, was the war conducted on our\r\npart. Provisions and other supplies furnished to our Army by Mexican\r\ncitizens were paid for at fair and liberal prices, agreed upon by the\r\nparties. After the lapse of a few months it became apparent that these\r\nassurances and this mild treatment had failed to produce the desired effect\r\nupon the Mexican population. While the war had been conducted on our part\r\naccording to the most humane and liberal principles observed by civilized\r\nnations, it was waged in a far different spirit on the part of Mexico. Not\r\nappreciating our forbearance, the Mexican people generally became hostile\r\nto the United States, and availed themselves of every opportunity to commit\r\nthe most savage excesses upon our troops. Large numbers of the population\r\ntook up arms, and, engaging in guerrilla warfare, robbed and murdered in\r\nthe most cruel manner individual soldiers or small parties whom accident or\r\nother causes had separated from the main body of our Army; bands of\r\nguerrilleros and robbers infested the roads, harassed our trains, and\r\nwhenever it was in their power cut off our supplies.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans having thus shown themselves to be wholly incapable of\r\nappreciating our forbearance and liberality, it was deemed proper to change\r\nthe manner of conducting the war, by making them feel its pressure\r\naccording to the usages observed under similar circumstances by all other\r\ncivilized nations.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as early as the 22d of September, 1846, instructions were\r\ngiven by the Secretary of War to Major-General Taylor to \"draw supplies\"\r\nfor our Army \"from the enemy without paying for them, and to require\r\ncontributions for its support, if in that way he was satisfied he could get\r\nabundant supplies for his forces.\" In directing the execution of these\r\ninstructions much was necessarily left to the discretion of the commanding\r\nofficer, who was best acquainted with the circumstances by which he was\r\nsurrounded, the wants of the Army, and the practicability of enforcing the\r\nmeasure. General Taylor, on the 26th of October, 1846, replied from\r\nMonterey that \"it would have been impossible hitherto, and is so now, to\r\nsustain the Army to any extent by forced contributions of money or\r\nsupplies.\" For the reasons assigned by him, he did not adopt the policy of\r\nhis instructions, but declared his readiness to do so \"should the Army in\r\nits future operations reach a portion of the country which may be made to\r\nsupply the troops with advantage.\" He continued to pay for the articles of\r\nsupply which were drawn from the enemy's country.\r\n\r\nSimilar instructions were issued to Major-General Scott on the 3d of April,\r\n1847, who replied from Jalapa on the 20th of May, 1847, that if it be\r\nexpected \"that the Army is to support itself by forced contributions levied\r\nupon the country we may ruin and exasperate the inhabitants and starve\r\nourselves.\" The same discretion was given to him that had been to General\r\nTaylor in this respect. General Scott, for the reasons assigned by him,\r\nalso continued to pay for the articles of supply for the Army which were\r\ndrawn from the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter the Army had reached the heart of the most wealthy portion of Mexico\r\nit was supposed that the obstacles which had before that time prevented it\r\nwould not be such as to render impracticable the levy of forced\r\ncontributions for its support, and on the 1st of September and again on the\r\n6th of October, 1847, the order was repeated in dispatches addressed by the\r\nSecretary of War to General Scott, and his attention was again called to\r\nthe importance of making the enemy bear the burdens of the war by requiring\r\nthem to furnish the means of supporting our Army, and he was directed to\r\nadopt this policy unless by doing so there was danger of depriving the Army\r\nof the necessary supplies. Copies of these dispatches were forwarded to\r\nGeneral Taylor for his government.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military\r\nand naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon all\r\nvessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico in our\r\nmilitary occupation, and to apply such contributions toward defraying the\r\nexpenses of the war. By virtue of the right of conquest and the laws of\r\nwar, the conqueror, consulting his own safety or convenience, may either\r\nexclude foreign commerce altogether from all such ports or permit it upon\r\nsuch terms and conditions as he may prescribe. Before the principal ports\r\nof Mexico were blockaded by our Navy the revenue derived from import duties\r\nunder the laws of Mexico was paid into the Mexican treasury. After these\r\nports had fallen into our military possession the blockade was raised and\r\ncommerce with them permitted upon prescribed terms and conditions. They\r\nwere opened to the trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more\r\nmoderate in their amount than those which had been previously levied by\r\nMexico, and the revenue, which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury,\r\nwas directed to be collected by our military and naval officers and applied\r\nto the use of our Army and Navy. Care was taken that the officers,\r\nsoldiers, and sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the\r\noperations of the order, and, as the merchandise imported upon which the\r\norder operated must be consumed by Mexican citizens, the contributions\r\nexacted were in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the\r\napplication of them to our own use. In directing this measure the object\r\nwas to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the\r\nexpenses of the war.\r\n\r\nFor the amount of contributions which have been levied in this form I refer\r\nyou to the accompanying reports of the Secretary of War and of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, by which it appears that a sum exceeding half a\r\nmillion of dollars has been collected. This amount would undoubtedly have\r\nbeen much larger but for the difficulty of keeping open communications\r\nbetween the coast and the interior, so as to enable the owners of the\r\nmerchandise imported to transport and vend it to the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry. It is confidently expected that this difficulty will to a great\r\nextent be soon removed by our increased forces which have been sent to the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nMeasures have recently been adopted by which the internal as well as the\r\nexternal revenues of Mexico in all places in our military occupation will\r\nbe seized and appropriated to the use of our Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nThe policy of levying upon the enemy contributions in every form\r\nconsistently with the laws of nations, which it may be practicable for our\r\nmilitary commanders to adopt, should, in my judgment, be rigidly enforced,\r\nand orders to this effect have accordingly been given. By such a policy, at\r\nthe same time that our own Treasury will be relieved from a heavy drain,\r\nthe Mexican people will be made to feel the burdens of the war, and,\r\nconsulting their own interests, may be induced the more readily to require\r\ntheir rulers to accede to a just peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the last session of Congress events transpired in\r\nthe prosecution of the war which in my judgment required a greater number\r\nof troops in the field than had been anticipated. The strength of the Army\r\nwas accordingly increased by \"accepting\" the services of all the volunteer\r\nforces authorized by the act of the 13th of May, 1846, without putting a\r\nconstruction on that act the correctness of which was seriously questioned.\r\nThe volunteer forces now in the field, with those which had been \"accepted\"\r\nto \"serve for twelve months\" and were discharged at the end of their term\r\nof service, exhaust the 50,000 men authorized by that act. Had it been\r\nclear that a proper construction of the act warranted it, the services of\r\nan additional number would have been called for and accepted; but doubts\r\nexisting upon this point, the power was not exercised. It is deemed\r\nimportant that Congress should at an early period of their session confer\r\nthe authority to raise an additional regular force to serve during the war\r\nwith Mexico and to be discharged upon the conclusion and ratification of a\r\ntreaty of peace. I invite the attention of Congress to the views presented\r\nby the Secretary of War in his report upon this subject.\r\n\r\nI recommend also that authority be given by law to call for and accept the\r\nservices of an additional number of volunteers, to be exercised at such\r\ntime and to such extent as the emergencies of the service may require.\r\n\r\nIn prosecuting the war with Mexico, whilst the utmost care has been taken\r\nto avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral nations, and\r\nnone has been given, liberal privileges have been granted to their commerce\r\nin the ports of the enemy in our military occupation. The difficulty with\r\nthe Brazilian Government, which at one time threatened to interrupt the\r\nfriendly relations between the two countries, will, I trust, be speedily\r\nadjusted. I have received information that an envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to the United States will shortly be appointed by\r\nHis Imperial Majesty, and it is hoped that he will come instructed and\r\nprepared to adjust all remaining differences between the two Governments in\r\na manner acceptable and honorable to both. In the meantime, I have every\r\nreason to believe that nothing will occur to interrupt our amicable\r\nrelations with Brazil.\r\n\r\nIt has been my constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most intimate\r\nrelations of friendship with all the independent powers of South America,\r\nand this policy has been attended with the happiest results. It is true\r\nthat the settlement and payment of many just claims of American citizens\r\nagainst these nations have been long delayed. The peculiar position in\r\nwhich they have been placed and the desire on the part of my predecessors\r\nas well as myself to grant them the utmost indulgence have hitherto\r\nprevented these claims from being urged in a manner demanded by strict\r\njustice. The time has arrived when they ought to be finally adjusted and\r\nliquidated, and efforts are now making for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to inform you that the Government of Peru has in good faith\r\npaid the first two installments of the indemnity of $30,000 each, and the\r\ngreater portion of the interest due thereon, in execution of the convention\r\nbetween that Government and the United States the ratifications of which\r\nwere exchanged at Lima on the 31st of October, 1846. The Attorney-General\r\nof the United States early in August last completed the adjudication of the\r\nclaims under this convention, and made his report thereon in pursuance of\r\nthe act of the 8th of August, 1846. The sums to which the claimants are\r\nrespectively entitled will be paid on demand at the Treasury.\r\n\r\nI invite the early attention of Congress to the present condition of our\r\ncitizens in China. Under our treaty with that power American citizens are\r\nwithdrawn from the jurisdiction, whether civil or criminal, of the Chinese\r\nGovernment and placed under that of our public functionaries in that\r\ncountry. By these alone can our citizens be tried and punished for the\r\ncommission of any crime; by these alone can questions be decided between\r\nthem involving the rights of persons and property, and by these alone can\r\ncontracts be enforced into which they may have entered with the citizens or\r\nsubjects of foreign powers. The merchant vessels of the United States lying\r\nin the waters of the five ports of China open to foreign commerce are under\r\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of officers of their own Government. Until\r\nCongress shall establish competent tribunals to try and punish crimes and\r\nto exercise jurisdiction in civil cases in China, American citizens there\r\nare subject to no law whatever. Crimes may be committed with impunity and\r\ndebts may be contracted without any means to enforce their payment.\r\nInconveniences have already resulted from the omission of Congress to\r\nlegislate upon the subject, and still greater are apprehended. The British\r\nauthorities in China have already complained that this Government has not\r\nprovided for the punishment of crimes or the enforcement of contracts\r\nagainst American citizens in that country, whilst their Government has\r\nestablished tribunals by which an American citizen can recover debts due\r\nfrom British subjects. Accustomed, as the Chinese are, to summary justice,\r\nthey could not be made to comprehend why criminals who are citizens of the\r\nUnited States should escape with impunity, in violation of treaty\r\nobligations, whilst the punishment of a Chinese who had committed any crime\r\nagainst an American citizen would be rigorously exacted. Indeed, the\r\nconsequences might be fatal to American citizens in China should a flagrant\r\ncrime be committed by any one of them upon a Chinese, and should trial and\r\npunishment not follow according to the requisitions of the treaty. This\r\nmight disturb, if not destroy, our friendly relations with that Empire, and\r\ncause an interruption of our valuable commerce. Our treaties with the\r\nSublime Porte, Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco, and Muscat also require the\r\nlegislation of Congress to carry them into execution, though the necessity\r\nfor immediate action may not be so urgent as in regard to China.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has submitted an estimate to defray the expense of\r\nopening diplomatic relations with the Papal States. The interesting\r\npolitical events now in progress in these States, as well as a just regard\r\nto our commercial interests, have, in my opinion, rendered such a measure\r\nhighly expedient.\r\n\r\nEstimates have also been submitted for the outfits and salaries of charges'\r\nd'affaires to the Republics of Bolivia, Guatemala, and Ecuador. The\r\nmanifest importance of cultivating the most friendly relations with all the\r\nindependent States upon this continent has induced me to recommend\r\nappropriations necessary for the maintenance of these missions.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress that an appropriation be made to be paid to the\r\nSpanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in\r\nthe Amistad case. I entertain the conviction that this is due to Spain\r\nunder the treaty of the 20th of October, 1795, and, moreover, that from the\r\nearnest manner in which the claim continues to be urged so long as it shall\r\nremain unsettled it will be a source of irritation and discord between the\r\ntwo countries, which may prove highly prejudicial to the interests of the\r\nUnited States. Good policy, no less than a faithful compliance with our\r\ntreaty obligations, requires that the inconsiderable appropriation demanded\r\nshould be made.\r\n\r\nA detailed statement of the condition of the finances will be presented in\r\nthe annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The imports for the\r\nlast fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1847, were of the value of\r\n$146,545,638, of which the amount exported was $8,011,158, leaving\r\n$138,534,480 in the country for domestic use. The value of the exports for\r\nthe same period was $158,648,622, of which $150,637,464 consisted of\r\ndomestic productions and $8,011,158 of foreign articles.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the same period amounted to\r\n$26,346,790.37, of which there was derived from customs $23,747,864.66,\r\nfrom sales of public lands $2,498,335.20, and from incidental and\r\nmiscellaneous sources $100,570.51. The last fiscal year, during which this\r\namount was received, embraced five months under the operation of the tariff\r\nact of 1842 and seven months during which the tariff act of 1846 was in\r\nforce. During the five months under the act of 1842 the amount received\r\nfrom customs was $7,842,306.90, and during the seven months under the act\r\nof 1846 the amount received was $15,905,557.76.\r\n\r\nThe net revenue from customs during the year ending on the 1st of December,\r\n1846, being the last year under the operation of the tariff act of 1842,\r\nwas $22,971,403.10, and the net revenue from customs during the year ending\r\non the 1st of December, 1847, being the first year under the operations of\r\nthe tariff act of 1846, was about $31,500,000, being an increase of revenue\r\nfor the first year under the tariff of 1846 of more than $8,500,000 over\r\nthat of the last year under the tariff of 1842.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last\r\nwere $59,451,177.65, of which $3,522,082.37 was on account payment of\r\nprincipal and interest of the public debt, including Treasury notes\r\nredeemed and not funded. The expenditures exclusive of payment of public\r\ndebt were $55,929,095.28.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1848, including the balance in the Treasury on\r\nthe 1st of July last, will amount to $42,886,545.80, of which $31,000,000,\r\nit is estimated, will be derived from customs, $3,500,000 from the sale of\r\nthe public lands, $400,000 from incidental sources, eluding sales made by\r\nthe Solicitor of the Treasury, and $6,285,294.55 from loans already\r\nauthorized by law, which, together with the balance in the Treasury on the\r\n1st of July last, make the sum estimated.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period, if peace with Mexico shall not be\r\nconcluded and the Army shall be increased as is proposed, will amount,\r\nincluding the necessary payments on account of principal and interest of\r\nthe public debt and Treasury notes, to $58,615,660.07. On the 1st of the\r\npresent month the amount of the public debt actually incurred, including\r\nTreasury notes, was $45,659,659.40. The public debt due on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1845, including Treasury notes, was $17,788,799.62, and consequently\r\nthe addition made to the public debt since that time is $27,870,859.78.\r\n\r\nOf the loan of twenty-three millions authorized by the act of the 28th of\r\nJanuary, 1847, the sum of five millions was paid out to the public\r\ncreditors or exchanged at par for specie; the remaining eighteen millions\r\nwas offered for specie to the highest bidder not below par, by an\r\nadvertisement issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and published from\r\nthe 9th of February until the 10th of April, 1847, when it was awarded to\r\nthe several highest bidders at premiums varying from one-eighth of per cent\r\nto 2 per cent above par. The premium has been paid into the Treasury and\r\nthe sums awarded deposited in specie in the Treasury as fast as it was\r\nrequired by the wants of the Government.\r\n\r\nTo meet the expenditures for the remainder of the present and for the next\r\nfiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1849, a further loan in aid of the\r\nordinary revenues of the Government will be necessary. Retaining a\r\nsufficient surplus in the Treasury, the loan required for the remainder of\r\nthe present fiscal year will be about $18,500,000. If the duty on tea and\r\ncoffee be imposed and the graduation of the price of the public lands shall\r\nbe made at an early period of your session, as recommended, the loan for\r\nthe present fiscal year may be reduced to $17,000,000. The loan may be\r\nfurther reduced by whatever amount of expenditures can be saved by military\r\ncontributions collected in Mexico. The most vigorous measures for the\r\naugmentation of these contributions have been directed and a very\r\nconsiderable sum is expected from that source. Its amount can not, however,\r\nbe calculated with any certainty. It is recommended that the loan to be\r\nmade be authorized upon the same terms and for the same time as that which\r\nwas authorized under the provisions of the act of the 28th of January,\r\n1847.\r\n\r\nShould the war with Mexico be continued until the 30th of June, 1849, it is\r\nestimated that a further loan of $20,500,000 will be required for the\r\nfiscal year ending on that day, in case no duty be imposed on tea and\r\ncoffee, and the public lands be not reduced and graduated in price, and no\r\nmilitary contributions shall be collected in Mexico. If the duty on tea and\r\ncoffee be imposed and the lands be reduced and graduated in price as\r\nproposed, the loan may be reduced to $17,000,000, and will be subject to be\r\nstill further reduced by the amount of the military contributions which may\r\nbe collected in Mexico. It is not proposed, however, at present to ask\r\nCongress for authority to negotiate this loan for the next fiscal year, as\r\nit is hoped that the loan asked for the remainder of the present fiscal\r\nyear, aided by military contributions which may be collected in Mexico, may\r\nbe sufficient. If, contrary to my expectation, there should be a necessity\r\nfor it, the fact will be communicated to Congress in time for their action\r\nduring the present session. In no event will a sum exceeding $6,000,000 of\r\nthis amount be needed before the meeting of the session of Congress in\r\nDecember, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe act of the 30th of July, 1846, \"reducing the duties on imports,\" has\r\nbeen in force since the 1st of December last, and I am gratified to state\r\nthat all the beneficial effects which were anticipated from its operation\r\nhave been fully realized. The public revenue derived from customs during\r\nthe year ending on the 1st of December, 1847, exceeds by more than\r\n$8,000,000 the amount received in the preceding year under the operation of\r\nthe act of 1842, which was superseded and repealed by it. Its effects are\r\nvisible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity which prevails in\r\nevery branch of business.\r\n\r\nWhile the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duties of the act of\r\n1842 and the substitution in their place of reasonable revenue rates levied\r\non articles imported according to their actual value has increased the\r\nrevenue and augmented our foreign trade, all the great interests of the\r\ncountry have been advanced and promoted.\r\n\r\nThe great and important interests of agriculture, which had been not only\r\ntoo much neglected, but actually taxed under the protective policy for the\r\nbenefit of other interests, have been relieved of the burdens which that\r\npolicy imposed on them; and our farmers and planters, under a more just and\r\nliberal commercial policy, are finding new and profitable markets abroad\r\nfor their augmented products. Our commerce is rapidly increasing, and is\r\nextending more widely the circle of international exchanges. Great as has\r\nbeen the increase of our imports during the past year, our exports of\r\ndomestic products sold in foreign markets have been still greater.\r\n\r\nOur navigating interest is eminently prosperous. The number of vessels\r\nbuilt in the United States has been greater than during any preceding\r\nperiod of equal length. Large profits have been derived by those who have\r\nconstructed as well as by those who have navigated them. Should the ratio\r\nof increase in the number of our merchant vessels be progressive, and be as\r\ngreat for the future as during the past year, the time is not distant when\r\nour tonnage and commercial marine will be larger than that of any other\r\nnation in the world.\r\n\r\nWhilst the interests of agriculture, of commerce, and of navigation have\r\nbeen enlarged and invigorated, it is highly gratifying to observe that our\r\nmanufactures are also in a prosperous condition. None of the ruinous\r\neffects upon this interest which were apprehended by some as the result of\r\nthe operation of the revenue system established by the act of 1846 have\r\nbeen experienced. On the contrary, the number of manufactories and the\r\namount of capital invested in them is steadily and rapidly increasing,\r\naffording gratifying proofs that American enterprise and skill employed in\r\nthis branch of domestic industry, with no other advantages than those\r\nfairly and incidentally accruing from a just System of revenue duties, are\r\nabundantly able to meet successfully all competition from abroad and still\r\nderive fair and remunerating profits. While capital invested in\r\nmanufactures is yielding adequate and fair profits under the new system,\r\nthe wages of labor, whether employed in manufactures, agriculture,\r\ncommerce, or navigation, have been augmented. The toiling millions whose\r\ndaily labor furnishes the supply of food and raiment and all the\r\nnecessaries and comforts of life are receiving higher wages and more steady\r\nand permanent employment than in any other country or at any previous\r\nperiod of our own history.\r\n\r\nSo successful have been all branches of our industry that a foreign war,\r\nwhich generally diminishes the resources of a nation, has in no essential\r\ndegree retarded our onward progress or checked our general prosperity.\r\n\r\nWith such gratifying evidences of prosperity and of the successful\r\noperation of the revenue act of 1846, every consideration of public policy\r\nrecommends that it shall remain unchanged. It is hoped that the system of\r\nimpost duties which it established may be regarded as the permanent policy\r\nof the country, and that the great interests affected by it may not again\r\nbe subject to be injuriously disturbed, as they have heretofore been by\r\nfrequent and sometimes sudden changes.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of increasing the revenue, and without changing or\r\nmodifying the rates imposed by the act of 1846 on the dutiable articles\r\nembraced by its provisions, I again recommend to your favorable\r\nconsideration the expediency of levying a revenue duty on tea and coffee.\r\nThe policy which exempted these articles from duty during peace, and when\r\nthe revenue to be derived from them was not needed, ceases to exist when\r\nthe country is engaged in war and requires the use of all of its available\r\nresources. It is a tax which would be so generally diffused among the\r\npeople that it would be felt oppressively by none and be complained of by\r\nnone. It is believed that there are not in the list of imported articles\r\nany which are more properly the subject of war duties than tea and coffee.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that $3,000,000 would be derived annually by a moderate\r\nduty imposed on these articles.\r\n\r\nShould Congress avail itself of this additional source of revenue, not only\r\nwould the amount of the public loan rendered necessary by the war with\r\nMexico be diminished to that extent, but the public credit and the public\r\nconfidence in the ability and determination of the Government to meet all\r\nits engagements promptly would be more firmly established, and the reduced\r\namount of the loan which it may be necessary to negotiate could probably be\r\nobtained at cheaper rates.\r\n\r\nCongress is therefore called upon to determine whether it is wiser to\r\nimpose the war duties recommended or by omitting to do so increase the\r\npublic debt annually $3,000,000 so long as loans shall be required to\r\nprosecute the war, and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the\r\nsemiannual interest upon it, and ultimately to extinguish the principal. If\r\nin addition to these duties Congress should graduate and reduce the price\r\nof such of the public lands as experience has proved will not command the\r\nprice placed upon them by the Government, an additional annual income to\r\nthe Treasury of between half a million and a million of dollars, it is\r\nestimated, would be derived from this source. Should both measures receive\r\nthe sanction of Congress, the annual amount of public debt necessary to be\r\ncontracted during the continuance of the war would be reduced near\r\n$4,000,000. The duties recommended to be levied on tea and coffee it is\r\nproposed shall be limited in their duration to the end of the war, and\r\nuntil the public debt rendered necessary to be contracted by it shall be\r\ndischarged. The amount of the public debt to be contracted should be\r\nlimited to the lowest practicable sum, and should be extinguished as early\r\nafter the conclusion of the war as the means of the Treasury will permit.\r\n\r\nWith this view, it is recommended that as soon as the war shall be over all\r\nthe surplus in the Treasury not needed for other indispensable objects\r\nshall constitute a sinking fund and be applied to the purchase of the\r\nfunded debt, and that authority be conferred by laws for that purpose. The\r\nact of the 6th of August, 1846, \"to establish a warehousing system,\" has\r\nbeen in operation more than a year, and has proved to be an important\r\nauxiliary to the tariff act of 1846 in augmenting the revenue and extending\r\nthe commerce of the country. Whilst it has tended to enlarge commerce, it\r\nhas been beneficial to our manufactures by diminishing forced sales at\r\nauction of foreign goods at low prices to raise the duties to be advanced\r\non them, and by checking fluctuations in the market. The system, although\r\nsanctioned by the experience of other countries, was entirely new in the\r\nUnited States, and is susceptible of improvement in some of its provisions.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, upon whom was devolved large discretionary\r\npowers in carrying this measure into effect, has collected and is now\r\ncollating the practical results of the system in other countries where it\r\nhas long been established, and will report at an early period of your\r\nsession such further regulations suggested by the investigation as may\r\nrender it still more effective and beneficial.\r\n\r\nBy the act to \"provide for the better organization of the Treasury and for\r\nthe collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public revenue\" all\r\nbanks were discontinued as fiscal agents of the Government, and the paper\r\ncurrency issued by them was no longer permitted to be received in payment\r\nof public dues. The constitutional treasury created by this act went into\r\noperation on the 1st of January last. Under the system established by it\r\nthe public moneys have been collected, safely kept, and disbursed by the\r\ndirect agency of officers of the Government in gold and silver, and\r\ntransfers of large amounts have been made from points of collection to\r\npoints of disbursement without loss to the Treasury or injury or\r\ninconvenience to the trade of the country.\r\n\r\nWhile the fiscal operations of the Government have been conducted with\r\nregularity and ease under this system, it has had a salutary effect in\r\nchecking and preventing an undue inflation of the paper currency issued by\r\nthe banks which exist under State charters. Requiring, as it does, all dues\r\nto the Government to be paid in gold and silver, its effect is to restrain\r\nexcessive issues of bank paper by the banks disproportioned to the specie\r\nin their vaults, for the reason that they are at all times liable to be\r\ncalled on by the holders of their notes for their redemption in order to\r\nobtain specie for the payment of duties and other public dues. The banks,\r\ntherefore, must keep their business within prudent limits, and be always in\r\na condition to meet such calls, or run the hazard of being compelled to\r\nsuspend specie payments and be thereby discredited. The amount of specie\r\nimported into the United States during the last fiscal year was\r\n$24,121,289, of which there was retained in the country $22,276,170. Had\r\nthe former financial system prevailed and the public moneys been placed on\r\ndeposit in the banks, nearly the whole of this amount would have gone into\r\ntheir vaults, not to be thrown into circulation by them, but to be withheld\r\nfrom the hands of the people as a currency and made the basis of new and\r\nenormous issues of bank paper. A large proportion of the specie imported\r\nhas been paid into the Treasury for public dues, and after having been to a\r\ngreat extent recoined at the Mint has been paid out to the public creditors\r\nand gone into circulation as a currency among the people. The amount of\r\ngold and silver coin now in circulation in the country is larger than at\r\nany former period.\r\n\r\nThe financial system established by the constitutional treasury has been\r\nthus far eminently successful in its operations, and I recommend an\r\nadherence to all its essential provisions, and especially to that vital\r\nprovision which wholly separates the Government from all connection with\r\nbanks and excludes bank paper from all revenue receipts.\r\n\r\nIn some of its details, not involving its general principles, the system is\r\ndefective and will require modification. These defects and such amendments\r\nas are deemed important were set forth in the last annual report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. These amendments are again recommended to the\r\nearly and favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the coinage at the Mint and its branches has exceeded\r\n$20,000,000. This has consisted chiefly in converting the coins of foreign\r\ncountries into American coin.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of foreign coin imported has been received at New York,\r\nand if a branch mint were established at that city all the foreign coin\r\nreceived at that port could at once be converted into our own coin without\r\nthe expense, risk, and delay of transporting it to the Mint for that\r\npurpose, and the amount recoined would be much larger.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that foreign coin, and especially foreign gold coin,\r\nwill not circulate extensively as a currency among the people. The\r\nimportant measure of extending our specie circulation, both of gold and\r\nsilver, and of diffusing it among the people can only be effected by\r\nconverting such foreign coin into American coin. I repeat the\r\nrecommendation contained in my last annual message for the establishment of\r\na branch of the Mint of the United States at the city of New York.\r\n\r\nAll the public lands which had been surveyed and were ready for market have\r\nbeen proclaimed for sale during the past year. The quantity offered and to\r\nbe offered for sale under proclamations issued since the 1st of January\r\nlast amounts to 9,138,531 acres. The prosperity of the Western States and\r\nTerritories in which these lands lie will be advanced by their speedy sale.\r\nBy withholding them from market their growth and increase of population\r\nwould be retarded, while thousands of our enterprising and meritorious\r\nfrontier population would be deprived of the opportunity of securing\r\nfreeholds for themselves and their families. But in addition to the general\r\nconsiderations which rendered the early sale of these lands proper, it was\r\na leading object at this time to derive as large a sum as possible from\r\nthis source, and thus diminish by that amount the public loan rendered\r\nnecessary by the existence of a foreign war.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that not less than 10,000,000 acres of the public lands\r\nwill be surveyed and be in a condition to be proclaimed for sale during the\r\nyear 1848.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I presented the reasons which in my judgment\r\nrendered it proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the public\r\nlands as have remained unsold for long periods after they had been offered\r\nfor sale at public auction.\r\n\r\nMany millions of acres of public lands lying within the limits of several\r\nof the Western States have been offered in the market and been subject to\r\nsale at private entry for more than twenty years and large quantities for\r\nmore than thirty years at the lowest price prescribed by the existing laws,\r\nand it has been found that they will not command that price. They must\r\nremain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period unless the price\r\ndemanded for them by the Government shall be reduced. No satisfactory\r\nreason is perceived why they should be longer held at rates above their\r\nreal value. At the present period an additional reason exists for adopting\r\nthe measure recommended. When the country is engaged in a foreign war, and\r\nwe must necessarily resort to loans, it would seem to be the dictate of\r\nwisdom that we should avail ourselves of all our resources and thus limit\r\nthe amount of the public indebtedness to the lowest possible sum.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the existing laws on the subject of preemption rights be\r\namended and modified so as to operate prospectively and to embrace all who\r\nmay settle upon the public lands and make improvements upon them, before\r\nthey are surveyed as well as afterwards, in all cases where such\r\nsettlements may be made after the Indian title shall have been\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIf the right of preemption be thus extended, it will embrace a large and\r\nmeritorious class of our citizens. It will increase the number of small\r\nfreeholders upon our borders, who will be enabled thereby to educate their\r\nchildren and otherwise improve their condition, while they will be found at\r\nall times, as they have ever proved themselves to be in the hour of danger\r\nto their country, among our hardiest and best volunteer soldiers, ever\r\nready to attend to their services in cases of emergencies and among the\r\nlast to leave the field as long as an enemy remains to be encountered. Such\r\na policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer emigrants with deeper\r\nfeelings of gratitude for the parental care of their Government, when they\r\nfind their dearest interests secured to them by the permanent laws of the\r\nland and that they are no longer in danger of losing their homes and\r\nhard-earned improvements by being brought into competition with a more\r\nwealthy class of purchasers at the land sales. The attention of Congress\r\nwas invited at their last and the preceding session to the importance of\r\nestablishing a Territorial government over our possessions in Oregon, and\r\nit is to be regretted that there was no legislation on the subject. Our\r\ncitizens who inhabit that distant region of country are still left without\r\nthe protection of our laws, or any regularly organized government. Before\r\nthe question of limits and boundaries of the Territory of Oregon was\r\ndefinitely settled, from the necessity of their condition the inhabitants\r\nhad established a temporary government of their own. Besides the want of\r\nlegal authority for continuing such a government, it is wholly inadequate\r\nto protect them in their rights of person and property, or to secure to\r\nthem the enjoyment of the privileges of other citizens, to which they are\r\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States. They should have the\r\nright of suffrage, be represented in a Territorial legislature and by a\r\nDelegate in Congress, and possess all the rights and privileges which\r\ncitizens of other portions of the territories of the United States have\r\nheretofore enjoyed or may now enjoy.\r\n\r\nOur judicial system, revenue laws, laws regulating trade and intercourse\r\nwith the Indian tribes, and the protection of our laws generally should be\r\nextended over them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the inhabitants in that Territory who had previously\r\nemigrated to it, large numbers of our citizens have followed them during\r\nthe present year, and it is not doubted that during the next and subsequent\r\nyears their numbers will be greatly increased.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session established post routes leading to Oregon, and\r\nbetween different points within that Territory, and authorized the\r\nestablishment of post-offices at \"Astoria and such other places on the\r\ncoasts of the Pacific within the territory of the United States as the\r\npublic interests may require.\" Post-offices have accordingly been\r\nestablished, deputy postmasters appointed, and provision made for the\r\ntransportation of the mails.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of peace with the Indian tribes residing west of the Rocky\r\nMountains will render it proper that authority should be given by law for\r\nthe appointment of an adequate number of Indian agents to reside among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI recommend that a surveyor-general's office be established in that\r\nTerritory, and that the public lands be surveyed and brought into market at\r\nan early period.\r\n\r\nI recommend also that grants, upon liberal terms, of limited quantities of\r\nthe public lands be made to all citizens of the United States who have\r\nemigrated, or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate, to Oregon\r\nand settle upon them. These hardy and adventurous citizens, who have\r\nencountered the dangers and privations of a long and toilsome journey, and\r\nhave at length found an abiding place for themselves and their families\r\nupon the utmost verge of our western limits, should be secured in the homes\r\nwhich they have improved by their labor. I refer you to the accompanying\r\nreport of the Secretary of War for a detailed account of the operations of\r\nthe various branches of the public service connected with the Department\r\nunder his charge. The duties devolving on this Department have been\r\nunusually onerous and responsible during the past year, and have been\r\ndischarged with ability and success.\r\n\r\nPacific relations continue to exist with the various Indian tribes, and\r\nmost of them manifest a strong friendship for the United States. Some\r\ndepredations were committed during the past year upon our trains\r\ntransporting supplies for the Army, on the road between the western border\r\nof Missouri and Santa Fe. These depredations, which are supposed to have\r\nbeen committed by bands from the region of New Mexico, have been arrested\r\nby the presence of a military force ordered out for that purpose. Some\r\noutrages have been perpetrated by a portion of the northwestern bands upon\r\nthe weaker and comparatively defenseless neighboring tribes. Prompt\r\nmeasures were taken to prevent such occurrences in future.\r\n\r\nBetween 1,000 and 2,000 Indians, belonging to several tribes, have been\r\nremoved during the year from the east of the Mississippi to the country\r\nallotted to them west of that river as their permanent home, and\r\narrangements have been made for others to follow.\r\n\r\nSince the treaty of 1846 with the Cherokees the feuds among them appear to\r\nhave subsided, and they have become more united and contented than they\r\nhave been for many years past. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of\r\nthe act of June 27, 1846, to settle claims arising under the treaty of\r\n1835-36 with that tribe have executed their duties, and after a patient\r\ninvestigation and a full and fair examination of all the cases brought\r\nbefore them closed their labors in the month of July last. This is the\r\nfourth board of commissioners which has been organized under this treaty.\r\nAmple opportunity has been afforded to all those interested to bring\r\nforward their claims. No doubt is entertained that impartial justice has\r\nbeen done by the late board, and that all valid claims embraced by the\r\ntreaty have been considered and allowed. This result and the final\r\nsettlement to be made with this tribe under the treaty of 1846, which will\r\nbe completed and laid before you during your session, will adjust all\r\nquestions of controversy between them and the United States and produce a\r\nstate of relations with them simple, well defined, and satisfactory. Under\r\nthe discretionary authority conferred by the act of the 3d of March last\r\nthe annuities due to the various tribes have been paid during the present\r\nyear to the heads of families instead of to their chiefs or such persons as\r\nthey might designate, as required by the law previously existing. This mode\r\nof payment has given general satisfaction to the great body of the Indians.\r\nJustice has been done to them, and they are grateful to the Government for\r\nit. A few chiefs and interested persons may object to this mode of payment,\r\nbut it is believed to be the only mode of preventing fraud and imposition\r\nfrom being practiced upon the great body of common Indians, constituting a\r\nmajority of all the tribes. It is gratifying to perceive that a number of\r\nthe tribes have recently manifested an increased interest in the\r\nestablishment of schools among them, and are making rapid advances in\r\nagriculture, some of them producing a sufficient quantity of food for their\r\nsupport and in some cases a surplus to dispose of to their neighbors. The\r\ncomforts by which those who have received even a very limited education and\r\nhave engaged in agriculture are surrounded tend gradually to draw off their\r\nless civilized brethren from the precarious means of subsistence by the\r\nchase to habits of labor and civilization.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a\r\nsatisfactory and gratifying account of the condition and operations of the\r\nnaval service during the past year. Our commerce has been pursued with\r\nincreased activity and with safety and success in every quarter of the\r\nglobe under the protection of our flag, which the Navy has caused to be\r\nrespected in the most distant seas.\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific the officers and men of our\r\nsquadrons have displayed distinguished gallantry and performed valuable\r\nservices. In the early stages of the war with Mexico her ports on both\r\ncoasts were blockaded, and more recently many of them have been captured\r\nand held by the Navy. When acting in cooperation with the land forces, the\r\nnaval officers and men have performed gallant and distinguished services on\r\nland as well as on water, and deserve the high commendation of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhile other maritime powers are adding to their navies large numbers of war\r\nsteamers, it was a wise policy on our part to make similar additions to our\r\nNavy. The four war steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March, 1847,\r\nare in course of construction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the four war steamers authorized by this act, the Secretary\r\nof the Navy has, in pursuance of its provisions, entered into contracts for\r\nthe construction of five steamers to be employed in the transportation of\r\nthe United States mail \"from New York to New Orleans, touching at\r\nCharleston, Savannah, and Havana, and from Havana to Chagres;\" for three\r\nsteamers to be employed in like manner from Panama to Oregon, \"so as to\r\nconnect with the mail from Havana to Chagres across the Isthmus;\" and for\r\nfive steamers to be employed in like manner from New York to Liverpool.\r\nThese steamers will be the property of the contractors, but are to be built\r\n\"under the superintendence and direction of a naval constructor in the\r\nemploy of the Navy Department, and to be so constructed as to render them\r\nconvertible at the least possible expense into war steamers of the first\r\nclass.\" A prescribed number of naval officers, as well as a post-office\r\nagent, are to be on board of them, and authority is reserved to the Navy\r\nDepartment at all times to \"exercise control over said steamships\" and \"to\r\nhave the right to take them for the exclusive use and service of the United\r\nStates upon making proper compensation to the contractors therefor.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst these steamships will be employed in transporting the mails of the\r\nUnited States coastwise and to foreign countries upon an annual\r\ncompensation to be paid to the owners, they will be always ready, upon an\r\nemergency requiring it, to be converted into war steamers; and the right\r\nreserved to take them for public use will add greatly to the efficiency and\r\nstrength of this description of our naval force. To the steamers thus\r\nauthorized under contracts made by the Secretary of the Navy should be\r\nadded five other steamers authorized under contracts made in pursuance of\r\nlaws by the Postmaster-General, making an addition, in the whole, of\r\neighteen war steamers subject to be taken for public use. As further\r\ncontracts for the transportation of the mail to foreign countries may be\r\nauthorized by Congress, this number may be enlarged indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various\r\ndistant parts of the globe is established, by means of American built sea\r\nsteamers, would find an ample reward in the increase of our commerce and in\r\nmaking our country and its resources more favorably known abroad; but the\r\nnational advantage is still greater--of having our naval officers made\r\nfamiliar with steam navigation and of having the privilege of taking the\r\nships already equipped for immediate service at a moment's notice, and will\r\nbe cheaply purchased by the compensation to be paid for the transportation\r\nof the mail in them over and above the postages received.\r\n\r\nA just national pride, no less than our commercial interests, would Seem to\r\nfavor the policy of augmenting the number of this description of vessels.\r\nThey can be built in our country cheaper and in greater numbers than in any\r\nother in the world.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General for a\r\ndetailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operations of that\r\nDepartment during the past year. It is gratifying to find that within so\r\nshort a period after the reduction in the rates of postage, and\r\nnotwithstanding the great increase of mail service, the revenue received\r\nfor the year will be sufficient to defray all the expenses, and that no\r\nfurther aid will be required from the Treasury for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first of the American mail steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1845, was completed and entered upon the service on the 1st of June\r\nlast, and is now on her third voyage to Bremen and other intermediate\r\nports. The other vessels authorized under the provisions of that act are in\r\ncourse of construction, and will be put upon the line as soon as completed.\r\nContracts have also been made for the transportation of the mail in a\r\nsteamer from Charleston to Havana.\r\n\r\nA reciprocal and satisfactory postal arrangement has been made by the\r\nPostmaster-General with the authorities of Bremen, and no difficulty is\r\napprehended in making similar arrangements with all other powers with which\r\nwe may have communications by mail steamers, except with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the first of the American steamers bound to Bremen at\r\nSouthampton, in the month of June last, the British post-office directed\r\nthe collection of discriminating postages on all letters and other mailable\r\nmatter which she took out to Great Britain or which went into the British\r\npost-office on their way to France and other parts of Europe. The effect of\r\nthe order of the British, post-office is to subject all letters and other\r\nmatter transported by American steamers to double postage, one postage\r\nhaving been previously paid on them to the United States, while letters\r\ntransported in British steamers are subject to pay but a single postage.\r\nThis measure was adopted with the avowed object of protecting the British\r\nline of mail steamers now running between Boston and Liverpool, and if\r\npermitted to Continue must speedily put an end to the transportation of all\r\nletters and other matter by American steamers and give to British steamers\r\na monopoly of the business. A just and fair reciprocity is all that we\r\ndesire, and on this we must insist. By our laws no such discrimination is\r\nmade against British steamers bringing letters into our ports, but all\r\nletters arriving in the United States are subject to the same rate of\r\npostage, whether brought in British or American vessels. I refer you to the\r\nreport of the Postmaster-General for a full statement of the facts of the\r\ncase and of the steps taken by him to correct this inequality. He has\r\nexerted all the power conferred upon him by the existing laws.\r\n\r\nThe minister of the United States at London has brought the subject to the\r\nattention of the British Government, and is now engaged in negotiations for\r\nthe purpose of adjusting reciprocal postal arrangements which shall be\r\nequally just to both countries. Should he fail in concluding such\r\narrangements, and should Great Britain insist on enforcing the unequal and\r\nunjust measure she has adopted, it will become necessary to confer\r\nadditional powers on the Postmaster-General in order to enable him to meet\r\nthe emergency and to put our own steamers on an equal footing with British\r\nsteamers engaged in transporting the mails between the two countries, and I\r\nrecommend that such powers be conferred. In view of the existing state of\r\nour country, I trust it may not be inappropriate, in closing this\r\ncommunication, to call to mind the words of wisdom and admonition of the\r\nfirst and most illustrious of my predecessors in his Farewell Address to\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\nThat greatest and best of men, who served his country so long and loved it\r\nso much, foresaw with \"serious concern\" the danger to our Union of\r\n\"characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--Northern and\r\nSouthern, Atlantic and Western--whence designing men may endeavor to excite\r\na belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views,\" and\r\nwarned his countrymen against it.\r\n\r\nSo deep and solemn was his conviction of the importance of the Union and of\r\npreserving harmony between its different parts, that he declared to his\r\ncountrymen in that address:\r\n\r\nIt is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense\r\nvalue of your national union to your collective and individual happiness;\r\nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to\r\nit; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of\r\nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with\r\njealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion\r\nthat it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the\r\nfirst dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from\r\nthe rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of half a century these admonitions of Washington fall upon\r\nus with all the force of truth. It is difficult to estimate the \"immense\r\nvalue\" of our glorious Union of confederated States, to which we are so\r\nmuch indebted for our growth in population and wealth and for all that\r\nconstitutes us a great and a happy nation. How unimportant are all our\r\ndifferences of opinion upon minor questions of public policy compared with\r\nits preservation, and how scrupulously should we avoid all agitating topics\r\nwhich may tend to distract and divide us into contending parties, separated\r\nby geographical lines, whereby it may be weakened or endangered.\r\n\r\nInvoking the blessing of the Almighty Ruler of the Universe upon your\r\ndeliberations, it will be my highest duty, no less than my sincere\r\npleasure, to cooperate with you in all measures which may tend to promote\r\nthe honor and enduring welfare of our common country.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Polk\r\nDecember 5, 1848\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nUnder the benignant providence of Almighty God the representatives of the\r\nStates and of the people are again brought together to deliberate for the\r\npublic good. The gratitude of the nation to the Sovereign Arbiter of All\r\nHuman Events should be commensurate with the boundless blessings which we\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nPeace, plenty, and contentment reign throughout our borders, and our\r\nbeloved country presents a sublime moral spectacle to the world.\r\n\r\nThe troubled and unsettled condition of some of the principal European\r\npowers has had a necessary tendency to check and embarrass trade and to\r\ndepress prices throughout all commercial nations, but notwithstanding these\r\ncauses, the United States, with their abundant products, have felt their\r\neffects less severely than any other country, and all our great interests\r\nare still prosperous and successful.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the great events of the past year and contrasting the agitated\r\nand disturbed state of other countries with our own tranquil and happy\r\ncondition, we may congratulate ourselves that we are the most favored\r\npeople on the face of the earth. While the people of other countries are\r\nstruggling to establish free institutions, under which man may govern\r\nhimself, we are in the actual enjoyment of them--a rich inheritance from\r\nour fathers. While enlightened nations of Europe are convulsed and\r\ndistracted by civil war or intestine strife, we settle all our political\r\ncontroversies by the peaceful exercise of the rights of freemen at the\r\nballot box.\r\n\r\nThe great republican maxim, so deeply engraven on the hearts of our people,\r\nthat the will of the majority, constitutionally expressed, shall prevail,\r\nis our sure safeguard against force and violence. It is a subject of just\r\npride that our fame and character as a nation continue rapidly to advance\r\nin the estimation of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nTo our wise and free institutions it is to be attributed that while other\r\nnations have achieved glory at the price of the suffering, distress, and\r\nimpoverishment of their people, we have won our honorable position in the\r\nmidst of an uninterrupted prosperity and of an increasing individual\r\ncomfort and happiness.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that our relations with all nations are friendly\r\nand pacific. Advantageous treaties of commerce have been concluded within\r\nthe last four years with New Granada, Peru, the Two Sicilies, Belgium,\r\nHanover, Oldenburg, and Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Pursuing our example, the\r\nrestrictive system of Great Britain, our principal foreign customer, has\r\nbeen relaxed, a more liberal commercial policy has been adopted by other\r\nenlightened nations, and our trade has been greatly enlarged and extended.\r\nOur country stands higher in the respect of the world than at any former\r\nperiod. To continue to occupy this proud position, it is only necessary to\r\npreserve peace and faithfully adhere to the great and fundamental principle\r\nof our foreign policy of noninterference in the domestic concerns of other\r\nnations. We recognize in all nations the right which we enjoy ourselves, to\r\nchange and reform their political institutions according to their own will\r\nand pleasure. Hence we do not look behind existing governments capable of\r\nmaintaining their own authority. We recognize all such actual governments,\r\nnot only from the dictates of true policy, but from a sacred regard for the\r\nindependence of nations. While this is our settled policy, it does not\r\nfollow that we can ever be indifferent spectators of the progress of\r\nliberal principles. The Government and people of the United States hailed\r\nwith enthusiasm and delight the establishment of the French Republic, as we\r\nnow hail the efforts in progress to unite the States of Germany in a\r\nconfederation similar in many respects to our own Federal Union. If the\r\ngreat and enlightened German States, occupying, as they do, a central and\r\ncommanding position in Europe, shall succeed in establishing such a\r\nconfederated government, securing at the same time to the citizens of each\r\nState local governments adapted to the peculiar condition of each, with\r\nunrestricted trade and intercourse with each other, it will be an important\r\nera in the history of human events. Whilst it will consolidate and\r\nstrengthen the power of Germany, it must essentially promote the cause of\r\npeace, commerce, civilization, and constitutional liberty throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWith all the Governments on this continent our relations, it is believed,\r\nare now on a more friendly and satisfactory footing than they have ever\r\nbeen at any former period.\r\n\r\nSince the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace with Mexico our\r\nintercourse with the Government of that Republic has been of the most\r\nfriendly character. The envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of\r\nthe United States to Mexico has been received and accredited, and a\r\ndiplomatic representative from Mexico of similar rank has been received and\r\naccredited by this Government. The amicable relations between the two\r\ncountries, which had been suspended, have been happily restored, and are\r\ndestined, I trust, to be long preserved. The two Republics, both situated\r\non this continent, and with coterminous territories, have every motive of\r\nsympathy and of interest to bind them together in perpetual amity.\r\n\r\nThis gratifying condition of our foreign relations renders it unnecessary\r\nfor me to call your attention more specifically to them.\r\n\r\nIt has been my constant aim and desire to cultivate peace and commerce with\r\nall nations. Tranquility at home and peaceful relations abroad constitute\r\nthe true permanent policy of our country. War, the scourge of nations,\r\nsometimes becomes inevitable, but is always to be avoided when it can be\r\ndone consistently with the rights and honor of a nation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of the war into which we were recently\r\nforced with a neighboring nation is the demonstration it has afforded of\r\nthe military strength of our country. Before the late war with Mexico\r\nEuropean and other foreign powers entertained imperfect and erroneous views\r\nof our physical strength as a nation and of our ability to prosecute war,\r\nand especially a war waged out of out own country. They saw that our\r\nstanding Army on the peace establishment did not exceed 10,000 men.\r\nAccustomed themselves to maintain in peace large standing armies for the\r\nprotection of thrones against their own subjects, as well as against\r\nforeign enemies, they had not conceived that it was possible for a nation\r\nwithout such an army, well disciplined and of long service, to wage war\r\nsuccessfully. They held in low repute our militia, and were far from\r\nregarding them as an effective force, unless it might be for temporary\r\ndefensive operations when invaded on our own soil. The events of the late\r\nwar with Mexico have not only undeceived them, but have removed erroneous\r\nimpressions which prevailed to some extent even among a portion of our own\r\ncountrymen. That war has demonstrated that upon the breaking out of\r\nhostilities not anticipated, and for which no previous preparation had been\r\nmade, a volunteer army of citizen soldiers equal to veteran troops, and in\r\nnumbers equal to any emergency, can in a short period be brought into the\r\nfield. Unlike what would have occurred in any other country, we were under\r\nno necessity of resorting to drafts or conscriptions. On the contrary, such\r\nwas the number of volunteers who patriotically tendered their services that\r\nthe chief difficulty was in making selections and determining who should be\r\ndisappointed and compelled to remain at home. Our citizen soldiers are\r\nunlike those drawn from the population of any other country. They are\r\ncomposed indiscriminately of all professions and pursuits--of farmers,\r\nlawyers, physicians, merchants, manufacturers, mechanics, and laborers--and\r\nthis not only among the officers, but the private soldiers in the ranks.\r\nOur citizen soldiers are unlike those of any other country in other\r\nrespects. They are armed, and have been accustomed from their youth up to\r\nhandle and use firearms, and a large proportion of them, especially in the\r\nWestern and more newly settled States, are expert marksmen. They are men\r\nwho have a reputation to maintain at home by their good conduct in the\r\nfield. They are intelligent, and there is an individuality of character\r\nwhich is found in the ranks of no other army. In battle each private man,\r\nas well as every officer, rights not only for his country, but for glory\r\nand distinction among his fellow-citizens when he shall return to civil\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico has demonstrated not only the ability of the Government\r\nto organize a numerous army upon a sudden call, but also to provide it with\r\nall the munitions and necessary supplies with dispatch, convenience, and\r\nease, and to direct its operations with efficiency. The strength of our\r\ninstitutions has not only been displayed in the valor and skill of our\r\ntroops engaged in active service in the field, but in the organization of\r\nthose executive branches which were charged with the general direction and\r\nconduct of the war. While too great praise can not be bestowed upon the\r\nofficers and men who fought our battles, it would be unjust to withhold\r\nfrom those officers necessarily stationed at home, who were charged with\r\nthe duty of furnishing the Army in proper time and at proper places with\r\nall the munitions of war and other supplies so necessary to make it\r\nefficient, the commendation to which they are entitled. The credit due to\r\nthis class of our officers is the greater when it is considered that no\r\narmy in ancient or modern times was even better appointed or provided than\r\nour Army in Mexico. Operating in an enemy's country, removed 2,000 miles\r\nfrom the seat of the Federal Government, its different corps spread over a\r\nvast extent of territory, hundreds and even thousands of miles apart from\r\neach other, nothing short of the untiring vigilance and extraordinary\r\nenergy of these officers could have enabled them to provide the Army at all\r\npoints and in proper season with all that was required for the most\r\nefficient service.\r\n\r\nIt is but an act of justice to declare that the officers in charge of the\r\nseveral executive bureaus, all under the immediate eye and supervision of\r\nthe Secretary of War, performed their respective duties with ability,\r\nenergy, and efficiency. They have reaped less of the glory of the war, not\r\nhaving been personally exposed to its perils in battle, than their\r\ncompanions in arms; but without their forecast, efficient aid, and\r\ncooperation those in the field would not have been provided with the ample\r\nmeans they possessed of achieving for themselves and their country the\r\nunfading honors which they have won for both.\r\n\r\nWhen all these facts are considered, it may cease to be a matter of so much\r\namazement abroad how it happened that our noble Army in Mexico, regulars\r\nand volunteers, were victorious upon every battlefield, however fearful the\r\nodds against them.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico has thus fully developed the capacity of republican\r\ngovernments to prosecute successfully a just and necessary foreign war with\r\nall the vigor usually attributed to more arbitrary forms of government. It\r\nhas been usual for writers on public law to impute to republics a want of\r\nthat unity, concentration of purpose, and vigor of execution which are\r\ngenerally admitted to belong to the monarchical and aristocratic forms; and\r\nthis feature of popular government has been supposed to display itself more\r\nparticularly in the conduct of a war carried on in an enemy's territory.\r\nThe war with Great Britain in 1812 was to a great extent confined within\r\nour own limits, and shed but little light on this subject; but the war\r\nwhich we have just closed by an honorable peace evinces beyond all doubt\r\nthat a popular representative government is equal to any emergency which is\r\nlikely to arise in the affairs of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico has developed most strikingly and conspicuously another\r\nfeature in our institutions. It is that without cost to the Government or\r\ndanger to our liberties we have in the bosom of our society of freemen,\r\navailable in a just and necessary war, virtually a standing army of\r\n2,000,000 armed citizen soldiers, such as fought the battles of Mexico. But\r\nour military strength does not consist alone in our capacity for extended\r\nand successful operations on land. The Navy is an important arm of the\r\nnational defense. If the services of the Navy were not so brilliant as\r\nthose of the Army in the late war with Mexico, it was because they had no\r\nenemy to meet on their own element. While the Army had opportunity of\r\nperforming more conspicuous service, the Navy largely participated in the\r\nconduct of the war. Both branches of the service performed their whole duty\r\nto the country. For the able and gallant services of the officers and men\r\nof the Navy, acting independently as well as in cooperation with our\r\ntroops, in the conquest of the Californias, the capture of Vera Cruz, and\r\nthe seizure and occupation of other important positions on the Gulf and\r\nPacific coasts, the highest praise is due. Their vigilance, energy, and\r\nskill rendered the most effective service in excluding munitions of war and\r\nother supplies from the enemy, while they secured a safe entrance for\r\nabundant supplies for our own Army. Our extended commerce was nowhere\r\ninterrupted, and for this immunity from the evils of war the country is\r\nindebted to the Navy.\r\n\r\nHigh praise is due to the officers of the several executive bureaus,\r\nnavy-yards, and stations connected with the service, all under the\r\nimmediate direction of the Secretary of the Navy, for the industry,\r\nforesight, and energy with which everything was directed and furnished to\r\ngive efficiency to that branch of the service. The same vigilance existed\r\nin directing the operations of the Navy as of the Army. There was concert\r\nof action and of purpose between the heads of the two arms of the service.\r\nBy the orders which were from time to time issued, our vessels of war on\r\nthe Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico were stationed in proper time and in\r\nproper positions to cooperate efficiently with the Army. By this means\r\ntheir combined power was brought to bear successfully on the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe great results which have been developed and brought to light by this\r\nwar will be of immeasurable importance in the future progress of our\r\ncountry. They will tend powerfully to preserve us from foreign collisions,\r\nand to enable us to pursue uninterruptedly our cherished policy of \"peace\r\nwith all nations, entangling alliances with none.\"\r\n\r\nOccupying, as we do, a more commanding position among nations than at any\r\nformer period, our duties and our responsibilities to ourselves and to\r\nposterity are correspondingly increased. This will be the more obvious when\r\nwe consider the vast additions which have been recently made to our\r\nterritorial possessions and their great importance and value.\r\n\r\nWithin less than four years the annexation of Texas to the Union has been\r\nconsummated; all conflicting title to the Oregon Territory south of the\r\nforty-ninth degree of north latitude, being all that was insisted on by any\r\nof my predecessors, has been adjusted, and New Mexico and Upper California\r\nhave been acquired by treaty. The area of these several Territories,\r\naccording to a report carefully prepared by the Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office from the most authentic information in his possession, and\r\nwhich is herewith transmitted, contains 1,193,061 square miles, or\r\n763,559,040 acres; while the area of the remaining twenty-nine States and\r\nthe territory not yet organized into States east of the Rocky Mountains\r\ncontains 2,059,513 square miles, or 1,318,126,058 acres. These estimates\r\nshow that the territories recently acquired, and over which our exclusive\r\njurisdiction and dominion have been extended, constitute a country more\r\nthan half as large as all that which was held by the United States before\r\ntheir acquisition. If Oregon be excluded from the estimate, there will\r\nstill remain within the limits of Texas, New Mexico, and California 851,598\r\nsquare miles, or 545,012,720 acres, being an addition equal to more than\r\none-third of all the territory owned by the United States before their\r\nacquisition, and, including Oregon, nearly as great an extent of territory\r\nas the whole of Europe, Russia only excepted. The Mississippi, so lately\r\nthe frontier of our country, is now only its center. With the addition of\r\nthe late acquisitions, the United States are now estimated to be nearly as\r\nlarge as the whole of Europe. It is estimated by the Superintendent of the\r\nCoast Survey in the accompanying report that the extent of the seacoast of\r\nTexas on the Gulf of Mexico is upward of 400 miles; of the coast of Upper\r\nCalifornia on the Pacific, of 970 miles, and of Oregon, including the\r\nStraits of Fuca, of 650 miles, making the whole extent of seacoast on the\r\nPacific 1,620 miles and the whole extent on both the Pacific and the Gulf\r\nof Mexico 2,020 miles. The length of the coast on the Atlantic from the\r\nnorthern limits of the United States around the capes of Florida to the\r\nSabine, on the eastern boundary of Texas, is estimated to be 3,100 miles;\r\nso that the addition of seacoast, including Oregon, is very nearly\r\ntwo-thirds as great as all we possessed before, and, excluding Oregon, is\r\nan addition of 1,370 miles, being nearly equal to one-half of the extent of\r\ncoast which we possessed before these acquisitions. We have now three great\r\nmaritime fronts--on the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and the\r\nPacific--making in the whole an extent of seacoast exceeding 5,000 miles.\r\nThis is the extent of the seacoast of the United States, not including\r\nbays, sounds, and small irregularities of the main shore and of the sea\r\nislands. If these be included, the length of the shore line of coast, as\r\nestimated by the Superintendent of the Coast Survey in his report, would be\r\n33,063 miles.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to calculate the value of these immense additions to\r\nour territorial possessions. Texas, lying contiguous to the western\r\nboundary of Louisiana, embracing within its limits a part of the navigable\r\ntributary waters of the Mississippi and an extensive seacoast, could not\r\nlong have remained in the hands of a foreign power without endangering the\r\npeace of our southwestern frontier. Her products in the vicinity of the\r\ntributaries of the Mississippi must have sought a market through these\r\nstreams, running into and through our territory, and the danger of\r\nirritation and collision of interests between Texas as a foreign state and\r\nourselves would have been imminent, while the embarrassments in the\r\ncommercial intercourse between them must have been constant and\r\nunavoidable. Had Texas fallen into the hands or under the influence and\r\ncontrol of a strong maritime or military foreign power, as she might have\r\ndone, these dangers would have been still greater. They have been avoided\r\nby her voluntary and peaceful annexation to the United States. Texas, from\r\nher position, was a natural and almost indispensable part of our\r\nterritories. Fortunately, she has been restored to our country, and now\r\nconstitutes one of the States of our Confederacy, \"upon an equal footing\r\nwith the original States.\" The salubrity of climate, the fertility of soil,\r\npeculiarly adapted to the production of some of our most valuable staple\r\ncommodities, and her commercial advantages must soon make her one of our\r\nmost populous States.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico, though situated in the interior and without a seacoast, is\r\nknown to contain much fertile land, to abound in rich mines of the precious\r\nmetals, and to be capable of sustaining a large population. From its\r\nposition it is the intermediate and connecting territory between our\r\nsettlements and our possessions in Texas and those on the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nUpper California, irrespective of the vast mineral wealth recently\r\ndeveloped there, holds at this day, in point of value and importance, to\r\nthe rest of the Union the same relation that Louisiana did when that fine\r\nterritory was acquired from France forty-five years ago. Extending nearly\r\nten degrees of latitude along the Pacific, and embracing the only safe and\r\ncommodious harbors on that coast for many hundred miles, with a temperate\r\nclimate and an extensive interior of fertile lands, it is scarcely possible\r\nto estimate its wealth until it shall be brought under the government of\r\nour laws and its resources fully developed. From its position it must\r\ncommand the rich commerce of China, of Asia, of the islands of the Pacific,\r\nof western Mexico, of Central America, the South American States, and of\r\nthe Russian possessions bordering on that ocean. A great emporium will\r\ndoubtless speedily arise on the Californian coast which may be destined to\r\nrival in importance New Orleans itself. The depot of the vast commerce\r\nwhich must exist on the Pacific will probably be at some point on the Bay\r\nof San Francisco, and will occupy the same relation to the whole western\r\ncoast of that ocean as New Orleans does to the valley of the Mississippi\r\nand the Gulf of Mexico. To this depot our numerous whale ships will resort\r\nwith their cargoes to trade, refit, and obtain supplies. This of itself\r\nwill largely contribute to build up a city, which would soon become the\r\ncenter of a great and rapidly increasing commerce. Situated on a safe\r\nharbor, sufficiently capacious for all the navies as well as the marine of\r\nthe world, and convenient to excellent timber for shipbuilding, owned by\r\nthe United States, it must become our great Western naval depot.\r\n\r\nIt was known that mines of the precious metals existed to a considerable\r\nextent in California at the time of its acquisition. Recent discoveries\r\nrender it probable that these mines are more extensive and valuable than\r\nwas anticipated. The accounts of the abundance of gold in that territory\r\nare of such an extraordinary character as would scarcely command belief\r\nwere they not corroborated by the authentic reports of officers in the\r\npublic service who have visited the mineral district and derived the facts\r\nwhich they detail from personal observation. Reluctant to credit the\r\nreports in general circulation as to the quantity of gold, the officer\r\ncommanding our forces in California visited the mineral district in July\r\nlast for the purpose of obtaining accurate information on the subject. His\r\nreport to the War Department of the result of his examination and the facts\r\nobtained on the spot is herewith laid before Congress. When he visited the\r\ncountry there were about 4,000 persons engaged in collecting gold. There is\r\nevery reason to believe that the number of persons so employed has since\r\nbeen augmented. The explorations already made warrant the belief that the\r\nsupply is very large and that gold is found at various places in an\r\nextensive district of country.\r\n\r\nInformation received from officers of the Navy and other sources, though\r\nnot so full and minute, confirms the accounts of the commander of our\r\nmilitary force in California. It appears also from these reports that mines\r\nof quicksilver are found in the vicinity of the gold region. One of them is\r\nnow being worked, and is believed to be among the most productive in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by the discovery of these rich mineral deposits and\r\nthe success which has attended the labors of those who have resorted to\r\nthem have produced a surprising change in the state of affairs in\r\nCalifornia. Labor commands a most exorbitant price, and all other pursuits\r\nbut that of searching for the precious metals are abandoned. Nearly the\r\nwhole of the male population of the country have gone to the gold\r\ndistricts. Ships arriving on the coast are deserted by their crews and\r\ntheir voyages suspended for want of sailors. Our commanding officer there\r\nentertains apprehensions that soldiers can not be kept in the public\r\nservice without a large increase of pay. Desertions in his command have\r\nbecome frequent, and he recommends that those who shall withstand the\r\nstrong temptation and remain faithful should be rewarded.\r\n\r\nThis abundance of gold and the all-engrossing pursuit of it have already\r\ncaused in California an unprecedented rise in the price of all the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThat we may the more speedily and fully avail ourselves of the undeveloped\r\nwealth of these mines, it is deemed of vast importance that a branch of the\r\nMint of the United States be authorized to be established at your present\r\nsession in California. Among other signal advantages which would result\r\nfrom such an establishment would be that of raising the gold to its par\r\nvalue in that territory. A branch mint of the United States at the great\r\ncommercial depot on the west coast would convert into our own coin not only\r\nthe gold derived from our own rich mines, but also the bullion and specie\r\nwhich our commerce may bring from the whole west coast of Central and South\r\nAmerica. The west coast of America and the adjacent interior embrace the\r\nrichest and best mines of Mexico, New Granada, Central America, Chili, and\r\nPeru. The bullion and specie drawn from these countries, and especially\r\nfrom those of western Mexico and Peru, to an amount in value of many\r\nmillions of dollars, are now annually diverted and carried by the ships of\r\nGreat Britain to her own ports, to be recoined or used to sustain her\r\nnational bank, and thus contribute to increase her ability to command so\r\nmuch of the commerce of the world. If a branch mint be established at the\r\ngreat commercial point upon that coast, a vast amount of bullion and specie\r\nwould flow thither to be recoined, and pass thence to New Orleans, New\r\nYork, and other Atlantic cities. The amount of our constitutional currency\r\nat home would be greatly increased, while its circulation abroad would be\r\npromoted. It is well known to our merchants trading to China and the west\r\ncoast of America that great inconvenience and loss are experienced from the\r\nfact that our coins are not current at their par value in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe powers of Europe, far removed from the west coast of America by the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, which intervenes, and by a tedious and dangerous navigation\r\naround the southern cape of the continent of America, can never\r\nsuccessfully compete with the United States in the rich and extensive\r\ncommerce which is opened to us at so much less cost by the acquisition of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe vast importance and commercial advantages of California have heretofore\r\nremained undeveloped by the Government of the country of which it\r\nconstituted a part. Now that this fine province is a part of our country,\r\nall the States of the Union, some more immediately and directly than\r\nothers, are deeply interested in the speedy development of its wealth and\r\nresources. No section of our country is more interested or will be more\r\nbenefited than the commercial, navigating, and manufacturing interests of\r\nthe Eastern States. Our planting and farming interests in every part of the\r\nUnion will Be greatly benefited by it. As our commerce and navigation are\r\nenlarged and extended, our exports of agricultural products and of\r\nmanufactures will be increased, and in the new markets thus opened they can\r\nnot fail to command remunerating and profitable prices.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of California and New Mexico, the settlement of the Oregon\r\nboundary, and the annexation of Texas, extending to the Rio Grande, are\r\nresults which, combined, are of greater consequence and will add more to\r\nthe strength and wealth of the nation than any which have preceded them\r\nsince the adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut to effect these great results not only California, but New Mexico, must\r\nbe brought under the control of regularly organized governments. The\r\nexisting condition of California and of that part of New Mexico lying west\r\nof the Rio Grande and without the limits of Texas imperiously demands that\r\nCongress should at its present session organize Territorial governments\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nUpon the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace with Mexico, on\r\nthe 30th of May last, the temporary governments which had been established\r\nover New Mexico and California by our military and naval commanders by\r\nvirtue of the rights of war ceased to derive any obligatory force from that\r\nsource of authority, and having been ceded to the United States, all\r\ngovernment and control over them under the authority of Mexico had ceased\r\nto exist. Impressed with the necessity of establishing Territorial\r\ngovernments over them, I recommended the subject to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress in my message communicating the ratified treaty\r\nof peace, on the 6th of July last, and invoked their action at that\r\nsession. Congress adjourned without making any provision for their\r\ngovernment. The inhabitants by the transfer of their country had become\r\nentitled to the benefit of our laws and Constitution, and yet were left\r\nwithout any regularly organized government. Since that time the very\r\nlimited power possessed by the Executive has been exercised to preserve and\r\nprotect them from the inevitable consequences of a state of anarchy. The\r\nonly government which remained was that established by the military\r\nauthority during the war. Regarding this to be a de facto government, and\r\nthat by the presumed consent of the inhabitants it might be continued\r\ntemporarily, they were advised to conform and submit to it for the short\r\nintervening period before Congress would again assemble and could legislate\r\non the subject. The views entertained by the Executive on this point are\r\ncontained in a communication of the Secretary of State dated the 7th of\r\nOctober last, which was forwarded for publication to California and New\r\nMexico, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. The small military force\r\nof the Regular Army which was serving within the limits of the acquired\r\nterritories at the close of the war was retained in them, and additional\r\nforces have been ordered there for the protection of the inhabitants and to\r\npreserve and secure the rights and interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo revenue has been or could be collected at the ports in California,\r\nbecause Congress failed to authorize the establishment of custom-houses or\r\nthe appointment of officers for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, by a circular letter addressed to collectors\r\nof the customs on the 7th day of October last, a copy of which is herewith\r\ntransmitted, exercised all the power with which he was invested by law.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act of the 14th of August last, extending the benefit\r\nof our post-office laws to the people of California, the Postmaster-General\r\nhas appointed two agents, who have proceeded, the one to California and the\r\nother to Oregon, with authority to make the necessary arrangements for\r\ncarrying its provisions into effect.\r\n\r\nThe monthly line of mail steamers from Panama to Astoria has been required\r\nto \"stop and deliver and take mails at San Diego, Monterey, and San\r\nFrancisco.\" These mail steamers, connected by the Isthmus of Panama with\r\nthe line of mail steamers on the Atlantic between New York and Chagres,\r\nwill establish a regular mail communication with California.\r\n\r\nIt is our solemn duty to provide with the least practicable delay for New\r\nMexico and California regularly organized Territorial governments. The\r\ncauses of the failure to do this at the last session of Congress are well\r\nknown and deeply to be regretted. With the opening prospects of increased\r\nprosperity and national greatness which the acquisition of these rich and\r\nextensive territorial possessions affords, how irrational it would be to\r\nforego or to reject these advantages by the agitation of a domestic\r\nquestion which is coeval with the existence of our Government itself, and\r\nto endanger by internal strifes, geographical divisions, and heated\r\ncontests for political power, or for any other cause, the harmony of the\r\nglorious Union of our confederated States--that Union which binds us\r\ntogether as one people, and which for sixty years has been our shield and\r\nprotection against every danger. In the eyes of the world and of posterity\r\nhow trivial and insignificant will be all our internal divisions and\r\nstruggles compared with the preservation of this Union of the States in all\r\nits vigor and with all its countless blessings! No patriot would foment and\r\nexcite geographical and sectional divisions. No lover of his country would\r\ndeliberately calculate the value of the Union. Future generations would\r\nlook in amazement upon the folly of such a course. Other nations at the\r\npresent day would look upon it with astonishment, and such of them as\r\ndesire to maintain and perpetuate thrones and monarchical or aristocratical\r\nprinciples will view it with exultation and delight, because in it they\r\nwill see the elements of faction, which they hope must ultimately overturn\r\nour system. Ours is the great example of a prosperous and free\r\nself-governed republic, commanding the admiration and the imitation of all\r\nthe lovers of freedom throughout the world. How solemn, therefore, is the\r\nduty, how impressive the call upon us and upon all parts of our country, to\r\ncultivate a patriotic spirit of harmony, of good-fellowship, of compromise\r\nand mutual concession, in the administration of the incomparable system of\r\ngovernment formed by our fathers in the midst of almost insuperable\r\ndifficulties, and transmitted to us with the injunction that we should\r\nenjoy its blessings and hand it down unimpaired to those who may come after\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn view of the high and responsible duties which we owe to ourselves and to\r\nmankind, I trust you may be able at your present session to approach the\r\nadjustment of the only domestic question which seriously threatens, or\r\nprobably ever can threaten, to disturb the harmony and successful\r\noperations of our system.\r\n\r\nThe immensely valuable possessions of New Mexico and California are already\r\ninhabited by a considerable population. Attracted by their great fertility,\r\ntheir mineral wealth, their commercial advantages, and the salubrity of the\r\nclimate, emigrants from the older States in great numbers are already\r\npreparing to seek new homes in these inviting regions. Shall the\r\ndissimilarity of the domestic institutions in the different States prevent\r\nus from providing for them suitable governments? These institutions existed\r\nat the adoption of the Constitution, but the obstacles which they\r\ninterposed were overcome by that spirit of compromise which is now invoked.\r\nIn a conflict of opinions or of interests, real or imaginary, between\r\ndifferent sections of our country, neither can justly demand all which it\r\nmight desire to obtain. Each, in the true spirit of our institutions,\r\nshould concede something to the other.\r\n\r\nOur gallant forces in the Mexican war, by whose patriotism and unparalleled\r\ndeeds of arms we obtained these possessions as an indemnity for our just\r\ndemands against Mexico, were composed of citizens who belonged to no one\r\nState or section of our Union. They were men from slaveholding and\r\nnonslaveholding States, from the North and the South, from the East and the\r\nWest. They were all companions in arms and fellow-citizens of the same\r\ncommon country, engaged in the same common cause. When prosecuting that war\r\nthey were brethren and friends, and shared alike with each other common\r\ntoils, dangers, and sufferings. Now, when their work is ended, when peace\r\nis restored, and they return again to their homes, put off the habiliments\r\nof war, take their places in society, and resume their pursuits in civil\r\nlife, surely a spirit of harmony and concession and of equal regard for the\r\nrights of all and of all sections of the Union ought to prevail in\r\nproviding governments for the acquired territories--the fruits of their\r\ncommon service. The whole people of the United States, and of every State,\r\ncontributed to defray the expenses of that war, and it would not be just\r\nfor any one section to exclude another from all participation in the\r\nacquired territory. This would not be in consonance with the just system of\r\ngovernment which the framers of the Constitution adopted.\r\n\r\nThe question is believed to be rather abstract than practical whether\r\nslavery ever can or would exist in any portion of the acquired territory\r\neven if it were left to the option of the slaveholding States themselves.\r\nFrom the nature of the climate and productions in much the larger portion\r\nof it it is certain it could never exist, and in the remainder the\r\nprobabilities are it would not. But however this may be, the question,\r\ninvolving, as it does, a principle of equality of rights of the separate\r\nand several States as equal copartners in the Confederacy, should not be\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nIn organizing governments over these territories no duty imposed on\r\nCongress by the Constitution requires that they should legislate on the\r\nsubject of slavery, while their power to do so is not only seriously\r\nquestioned, but denied by many of the soundest expounders of that\r\ninstrument. Whether Congress shall legislate or not, the people of the\r\nacquired territories, when assembled in convention to form State\r\nconstitutions, will possess the sole and exclusive power to determine for\r\nthemselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limits. If\r\nCongress shall abstain from interfering with the question, the people of\r\nthese territories will be left free to adjust it as they may think proper\r\nwhen they apply for admission as States into the Union. No enactment of\r\nCongress could restrain the people of any of the sovereign States of the\r\nUnion, old or new, North or South, slaveholding or nonslaveholding, from\r\ndetermining the character of their own domestic institutions as they may\r\ndeem wise and proper. Any and all the States possess this right, and\r\nCongress can not deprive them of it. The people of Georgia might if they\r\nchose so alter their constitution as to abolish slavery within its limits,\r\nand the people of Vermont might so alter their constitution as to admit\r\nslavery within its limits. Both States would possess the right, though, as\r\nall know, it is not probable that either would exert it.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the peace and harmony of the Union that this question\r\nis in its nature temporary and can only continue for the brief period which\r\nwill intervene before California and New Mexico may be admitted as States\r\ninto the Union. From the tide of population now flowing into them it is\r\nhighly probable that this will soon occur.\r\n\r\nConsidering the several States and the citizens of the several States as\r\nequals and entitled to equal rights under the Constitution, if this were an\r\noriginal question it might well be insisted on that the principle of\r\nnoninterference is the true doctrine and that Congress could not, in the\r\nabsence of any express grant of power, interfere with their relative\r\nrights. Upon a great emergency, however, and under menacing dangers to the\r\nUnion, the Missouri compromise line in respect to slavery was adopted. The\r\nsame line was extended farther west in the acquisition of Texas. After an\r\nacquiescence of nearly thirty years in the principle of compromise\r\nrecognized and established by these acts, and to avoid the danger to the\r\nUnion which might follow if it were now disregarded, I have heretofore\r\nexpressed the opinion that that line of compromise should be extended on\r\nthe parallel of 36° 30' from the western boundary of Texas, where it\r\nnow terminates, to the Pacific Ocean. This is the middle ground of\r\ncompromise, upon which the different sections of the Union may meet, as\r\nthey have heretofore met. If this be done, it is confidently believed a\r\nlarge majority of the people of every section of the country, however\r\nwidely their abstract opinions on the subject of slavery may differ, would\r\ncheerfully and patriotically acquiesce in it, and peace and harmony would\r\nagain fill our borders.\r\n\r\nThe restriction north of the line was only yielded to in the case of\r\nMissouri and Texas upon a principle of compromise, made necessary for the\r\nsake of preserving the harmony and possibly the existence of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was upon these considerations that at the close of your last session I\r\ngave my sanction to the principle of the Missouri compromise line by\r\napproving and signing the bill to establish \"the Territorial government of\r\nOregon.\" From a sincere desire to preserve the harmony of the Union, and in\r\ndeference for the acts of my predecessors, I felt constrained to yield my\r\nacquiescence to the extent to which they had gone in compromising this\r\ndelicate and dangerous question. But if Congress shall now reverse the\r\ndecision by which the Missouri compromise was effected, and shall propose\r\nto extend the restriction over the whole territory, south as well as north\r\nof the parallel of 36° 30', it will cease to be a compromise, and must\r\nbe regarded as an original question.\r\n\r\nIf Congress, instead of observing the course of noninterference, leaving\r\nthe adoption of their own domestic institutions to the people who may\r\ninhabit these territories, or if, instead of extending the Missouri\r\ncompromise line to the Pacific, shall prefer to submit the legal and\r\nconstitutional questions which may arise to the decision of the judicial\r\ntribunals, as was proposed in a bill which passed the Senate at your last\r\nsession, an adjustment may be effected in this mode. If the whole subject\r\nbe referred to the judiciary, all parts of the Union should cheerfully\r\nacquiesce in the final decision of the tribunal created by the Constitution\r\nfor the settlement of all questions which may arise under the Constitution,\r\ntreaties, and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nCongress is earnestly invoked, for the sake of the Union, its harmony, and\r\nour continued prosperity as a nation, to adjust at its present session\r\nthis, the only dangerous question which lies in our path, if not in some\r\none of the modes suggested, in some other which may be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of the establishment of regular governments over the\r\nacquired territories, a joint commission of officers of the Army and Navy\r\nhas been ordered to proceed to the coast of California and Oregon for the\r\npurpose of making reconnoissances and a report as to the proper sites for\r\nthe erection of fortifications or other defensive works on land and of\r\nsuitable situations for naval stations. The information which may be\r\nexpected from a scientific and skillful examination of the whole face of\r\nthe coast will be eminently useful to Congress when they come to consider\r\nthe propriety of making appropriations for these great national objects.\r\nProper defenses on land will be necessary for the security and protection\r\nof our possessions, and the establishment of navy-yards and a dock for the\r\nrepair and construction of vessels will be important alike to our Navy and\r\ncommercial marine. Without such establishments every vessel, whether of the\r\nNavy or of the merchant service, requiring repair must at great expense\r\ncome round Cape Horn to one of our Atlantic yards for that purpose. With\r\nsuch establishments vessels, it is believed may be built or repaired as\r\ncheaply in California as upon the Atlantic coast. They would give\r\nemployment to many of our enterprising shipbuilders and mechanics and\r\ngreatly facilitate and enlarge our commerce in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAs it is ascertained that mines of gold, silver, copper, and quicksilver\r\nexist in New Mexico and California, and that nearly all the lands where\r\nthey are found belong to the United States, it is deemed important to the\r\npublic interest that provision be made for a geological and mineralogical\r\nexamination of these regions. Measures should be adopted to preserve the\r\nmineral lands, especially such as contain the precious metals, for the use\r\nof the United States, or, if brought into market, to separate them from the\r\nfarming lands and dispose of them in such manner as to secure a large\r\nreturn of money to the Treasury and at the same time to lead to the\r\ndevelopment of their wealth by individual proprietors and purchasers. To do\r\nthis it will be necessary to provide for an immediate survey and location\r\nof the lots. If Congress should deem it proper to dispose of the mineral\r\nlands, they should be sold in small quantities and at a fixed minimum\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nI recommend that surveyors-general's offices be authorized to be\r\nestablished in New Mexico and California and provision made for surveying\r\nand bringing the public lands into market at the earliest practicable\r\nperiod. In disposing of these lands, I recommend that the right of\r\npreemption be secured and liberal grants made to the early emigrants who\r\nhave settled or may settle upon them.\r\n\r\nIt will be important to extend our revenue laws over these territories, and\r\nespecially over California, at an early period. There is already a\r\nconsiderable commerce with California, and until ports of entry shall be\r\nestablished and collectors appointed no revenue can be received.\r\n\r\nIf these and other necessary and proper measures be adopted for the\r\ndevelopment of the wealth and resources of New Mexico and California and\r\nregular Territorial governments be established over them, such will\r\nprobably be the rapid enlargement of our commerce and navigation and such\r\nthe addition to the national wealth that the present generation may live to\r\nwitness the controlling commercial and monetary power of the world\r\ntransferred from London and other European emporiums to the city of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions which were entertained by some of our statesmen in the\r\nearlier periods of the Government that our system was incapable of\r\noperating with sufficient energy and success over largely extended\r\nterritorial limits, and that if this were attempted it would fall to pieces\r\nby its own weakness, have been dissipated by our experience. By the\r\ndivision of power between the States and Federal Government the latter is\r\nfound to operate with as much energy in the extremes as in the center. It\r\nis as efficient in the remotest of the thirty States which now compose the\r\nUnion as it was in the thirteen States which formed our Constitution.\r\nIndeed, it may well be doubted whether if our present population had been\r\nconfined within the limits of the original thirteen States the tendencies\r\nto centralization and consolidation would not have been such as to have\r\nencroached upon the essential reserved rights of the States, and thus to\r\nhave made the Federal Government a widely different one, practically, from\r\nwhat it is in theory and was intended to be by its framers. So far from\r\nentertaining apprehensions of the safety of our system by the extension of\r\nour territory, the belief is confidently entertained that each new State\r\ngives strength and an additional guaranty for the preservation of the Union\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the provisions of the thirteenth article of the treaty of\r\npeace, friendship, limits, and settlement with the Republic of Mexico, and\r\nof the act of July 29, 1848, claims of our citizens, which had been\r\n\"already liquidated and decided, against the Mexican Republic\" amounting,\r\nwith the interest thereon, to $2,023,832.51 have been liquidated and paid.\r\nThere remain to be paid of these claims $74,192.26.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session having made no provision for executing the\r\nfifteenth article of the treaty, by which the United States assume to make\r\nsatisfaction for the \"unliquidated claims\" of our citizens against Mexico\r\nto \"an amount not exceeding three and a quarter millions of dollars,\" the\r\nsubject is again recommended to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of the treaty with Mexico took place on the\r\n30th of May, 1848. Within one year after that time the commissioner and\r\nsurveyor which each Government stipulates to appoint are required to meet\r\n\"at the port of San Diego and proceed to run and mark the said boundary in\r\nits whole course to the mouth of the Rio Bravo del Norte.\" It will be seen\r\nfrom this provision that the period within which a commissioner and\r\nsurveyor of the respective Governments are to meet at San Diego will expire\r\non the 30th of May, 1849. Congress at the close of its last session made an\r\nappropriation for \"the expenses of running and marking the boundary line\"\r\nbetween the two countries, but did not fix the amount of salary which\r\nshould be paid to the commissioner and surveyor to be appointed on the part\r\nof the United States. It is desirable that the amount of compensation which\r\nthey shall receive should be prescribed by law, and not left, as at\r\npresent, to Executive discretion.\r\n\r\nMeasures were adopted at the earliest practicable period to organize the\r\n\"Territorial government of Oregon,\" as authorized by the act of the 14th of\r\nAugust last. The governor and marshal of the Territory, accompanied by a\r\nsmall military escort, left the frontier of Missouri in September last, and\r\ntook the southern route, by the way of Santa Fe and the river Gila, to\r\nCalifornia, with the intention of proceeding thence in one of our vessels\r\nof war to their destination. The governor was fully advised of the great\r\nimportance of his early arrival in the country, and it is confidently\r\nbelieved he may reach Oregon in the latter part of the present month or\r\nearly in the next. The other officers for the Territory have proceeded by\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May last I communicated information to Congress that an\r\nIndian war had broken out in Oregon, and recommended that authority be\r\ngiven to raise an adequate number of volunteers to proceed without delay to\r\nthe assistance of our fellow-citizens in that Territory. The authority to\r\nraise such a force not having been granted by Congress, as soon as their\r\nservices could be dispensed with in Mexico orders were issued to the\r\nregiment of mounted riflemen to proceed to Jefferson Barracks, in Missouri,\r\nand to prepare to march to Oregon as soon as the necessary provision could\r\nbe made. Shortly before it was ready to march it was arrested by the\r\nprovision of the act passed by Congress on the last day of the last\r\nsession, which directed that all the noncommissioned officers, musicians,\r\nand privates of that regiment who had been in service in Mexico should,\r\nupon their application, be entitled to be discharged. The effect of this\r\nprovision was to disband the rank and file of the regiment, and before\r\ntheir places could be filled by recruits the season had so far advanced\r\nthat it was impracticable for it to proceed until the opening of the next\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October last the accompanying communication was received\r\nfrom the governor of the temporary government of Oregon, giving information\r\nof the continuance of the Indian disturbances and of the destitution and\r\ndefenseless condition of the inhabitants. Orders were immediately\r\ntransmitted to the commander of our squadron in the Pacific to dispatch to\r\ntheir assistance a part of the naval forces on that station, to furnish\r\nthem with arms and ammunition, and to continue to give them such aid and\r\nprotection as the Navy could afford until the Army could reach the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of humanity, and one which has always been pursued by the\r\nUnited States, to cultivate the good will of the aboriginal tribes of this\r\ncontinent and to restrain them from making war and indulging in excesses by\r\nmild means rather than by force. That this could have been done with the\r\ntribes in Oregon had that Territory been brought under the government of\r\nour laws at an earlier period, and had other suitable measures been adopted\r\nby Congress, such as now exist in our intercourse with the other Indian\r\ntribes within our limits, can not be doubted. Indeed, the immediate and\r\nonly cause of the existing hostility of the Indians of Oregon is\r\nrepresented to have been the long delay of the United States in making to\r\nthem some trifling compensation, in such articles as they wanted, for the\r\ncountry now occupied by our emigrants, which the Indians claimed and over\r\nwhich they formerly roamed. This compensation had been promised to them by\r\nthe temporary government established in Oregon, but its fulfillment had\r\nbeen postponed from time to time for nearly two years, whilst those who\r\nmade it had been anxiously waiting for Congress to establish a Territorial\r\ngovernment over the country. The Indians became at length distrustful of\r\ntheir good faith and sought redress by plunder and massacre, which finally\r\nled to the present difficulties. A few thousand dollars in suitable\r\npresents, as a compensation for the country which had been taken possession\r\nof by our citizens, would have satisfied the Indians and have prevented the\r\nwar. A small amount properly distributed, it is confidently believed, would\r\nsoon restore quiet. In this Indian war our fellow-citizens of Oregon have\r\nbeen compelled to take the field in their own defense, have performed\r\nvaluable military services, and been subjected to expenses which have\r\nfallen heavily upon them. Justice demands that provision should be made by\r\nCongress to compensate them for their services and to refund to them the\r\nnecessary expenses which they have incurred.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation heretofore made to Congress, that provision be\r\nmade for the appointment of a suitable number of Indian agents to reside\r\namong the tribes of Oregon, and that a small sum be appropriated to enable\r\nthese agents to cultivate friendly relations with them. If this be done,\r\nthe presence of a small military force will be all that is necessary to\r\nkeep them in check and preserve peace. I recommend that similar provisions\r\nbe made as regards the tribes inhabiting northern Texas, New Mexico,\r\nCalifornia, and the extensive region lying between our settlements in\r\nMissouri and these possessions, as the most effective means of preserving\r\npeace upon our borders and within the recently acquired territories.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will present in his annual report a highly\r\nsatisfactory statement of the condition of the finances.\r\n\r\nThe imports for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were of the\r\nvalue of $154,977,876, of which the amount exported was $21,128,010,\r\nleaving $133,849,866 in the country for domestic use. The value of the\r\nexports for the same period was $154,032,131, consisting of domestic\r\nproductions amounting to $132,904,121 and $21,128,010 of foreign articles.\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the same period, exclusive of loans,\r\namounted to $35,436,750.59, of which there was derived from customs\r\n$31,757,070.96, from sales of public lands $3,328,642.56, and from\r\nmiscellaneous and incidental sources $351,037.07.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the revenue from customs for the last fiscal year\r\nexceeded by $757,070.96 the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury in\r\nhis last annual report, and that the aggregate receipts during the same\r\nperiod from customs, lands, and miscellaneous sources also exceeded the\r\nestimate by the sum of $536,750.59, indicating, however, a very near\r\napproach in the estimate to the actual result.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last,\r\nincluding those for the war and exclusive of payments of principal and\r\ninterest for the public debt, were $42,811,970.03.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1849, including the balance in the Treasury on\r\nthe 1st of July last, will amount to the sum of $57,048,969.90, of which\r\n$32,000,000, it is estimated, will be derived from customs, $3,000,000 from\r\nthe sales of the public lands, and $1,200,000 from miscellaneous and\r\nincidental sources, including the premium upon the loan, and the amount\r\npaid and to be paid into the Treasury on account of military contributions\r\nin Mexico, and the sales of arms and vessels and other public property\r\nrendered unnecessary for the use of the Government by the termination of\r\nthe war, and $20,695,435.30 from loans already negotiated, including\r\nTreasury notes funded, which, together with the balance in the Treasury on\r\nthe 1st of July last, make the sum estimated.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period, including the necessary payment on\r\naccount of the principal and interest of the public debt, and the principal\r\nand interest of the first installment due to Mexico on the 30th of May\r\nnext, and other expenditures growing out of the war to be paid during the\r\npresent year, will amount, including the reimbursement of Treasury notes,\r\nto the sum of $54,195,275.06, leaving an estimated balance in the Treasury\r\non the 1st of July, 1849, of $2,853,694.84.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will present, as required by law, the\r\nestimate of the receipts and expenditures for the next fiscal year. The\r\nexpenditures as estimated for that year are $33,213,152.73, including\r\n$3,799,102.18 for the interest on the public debt and $3,540,000 for the\r\nprincipal and interest due to Mexico on the 30th of May, 1850, leaving the\r\nsum of $25,874,050.35, which, it is believed, will be ample for the\r\nordinary peace expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the tariff act of 1846 have been such during the past\r\nyear as fully to meet the public expectation and to confirm the opinion\r\nheretofore expressed of the wisdom of the change in our revenue system\r\nwhich was effected by it. The receipts under it into the Treasury for the\r\nfirst fiscal year after its enactment exceeded by the sum of $5,044,403.09\r\nthe amount collected during the last fiscal year under the tariff act of\r\n1842, ending the 30th of June, 1846. The total revenue realized from the\r\ncommencement of its operation, on the 1st of December, 1846, until the\r\nclose of the last quarter, on the 30th of September last, being twenty-two\r\nmonths, was $56,654,563.79, being a much larger sum than was ever before\r\nreceived from duties during any equal period under the tariff acts of 1824,\r\n1828, 1832, and 1842. Whilst by the repeal of highly protective and\r\nprohibitory duties the revenue has been increased, the taxes on the people\r\nhave been diminished. They have been relieved from the heavy amounts with\r\nwhich they were burthened under former laws in the form of increased prices\r\nor bounties paid to favored classes and pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe predictions which were made that the tariff act of 1846 would reduce\r\nthe amount of revenue below that collected under the act of 1842, and would\r\nprostrate the business and destroy the prosperity of the country, have not\r\nbeen verified. With an increased and increasing revenue, the finances are\r\nin a highly flourishing condition. Agriculture, commerce, and navigation\r\nare prosperous; the prices of manufactured fabrics and of other products\r\nare much less injuriously affected than was to have been anticipated from\r\nthe unprecedented revulsions which during the last and the present year\r\nhave overwhelmed the industry and paralyzed the credit and commerce of so\r\nmany great and enlightened nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nSevere commercial revulsions abroad have always heretofore operated to\r\ndepress and often to affect disastrously almost every branch of American\r\nindustry. The temporary depression of a portion of our manufacturing\r\ninterests is the effect of foreign causes, and is far less severe than has\r\nprevailed on all former similar occasions.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that, looking to the great aggregate of all our interests,\r\nthe whole country was never more prosperous than at the present period, and\r\nnever more rapidly advancing in wealth and population. Neither the foreign\r\nwar in which we have been involved, nor the loans which have absorbed so\r\nlarge a portion of our capital, nor the commercial revulsion in Great\r\nBritain in 1847, nor the paralysis of credit and commerce throughout Europe\r\nin 1848, have affected injuriously to any considerable extent any of the\r\ngreat interests of the country or arrested our onward march to greatness,\r\nwealth, and power.\r\n\r\nHad the disturbances in Europe not occurred, our commerce would undoubtedly\r\nhave been still more extended, and would have added still more to the\r\nnational wealth and public prosperity. But notwithstanding these\r\ndisturbances, the operations of the revenue system established by the\r\ntariff act of 1846 have been so generally beneficial to the Government and\r\nthe business of the country that no change in its provisions is demanded by\r\na wise public policy, and none is recommended.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the constitutional treasury established by the act of the\r\n6th of August, 1846, in the receipt, custody, and disbursement of the\r\npublic money have continued to be successful. Under this system the public\r\nfinances have been carried through a foreign war, involving the necessity\r\nof loans and extraordinary expenditures and requiring distant transfers and\r\ndisbursements, without embarrassment, and no loss has occurred of any of\r\nthe public money deposited under its provisions. Whilst it has proved to be\r\nsafe and useful to the Government, its effects have been most beneficial\r\nupon the business of the country. It has tended powerfully to secure an\r\nexemption from that inflation and fluctuation of the paper currency so\r\ninjurious to domestic industry and rendering so uncertain the rewards of\r\nlabor, and, it is believed, has largely contributed to preserve the whole\r\ncountry from a serious commercial revulsion, such as often occurred under\r\nthe bank deposit system. In the year 1847 there was a revulsion in the\r\nbusiness of Great Britain of great extent and intensity, which was followed\r\nby failures in that Kingdom unprecedented in number and amount of losses.\r\nThis is believed to be the first instance when such disastrous\r\nbankruptcies, occurring in a country with which we have such extensive\r\ncommerce, produced little or no injurious effect upon our trade or\r\ncurrency. We remained but little affected in our money market, and our\r\nbusiness and industry were still prosperous and progressive.\r\n\r\nDuring the present year nearly the whole continent of Europe has been\r\nconvulsed by civil war and revolutions, attended by numerous bankruptcies,\r\nby an unprecedented fall in their public securities, and an almost\r\nuniversal paralysis of commerce and industry; and yet, although our trade\r\nand the prices of our products must have been somewhat unfavorably affected\r\nby these causes, we have escaped a revulsion, our money market is\r\ncomparatively easy, and public and private credit have advanced and\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently believed that we have been saved from their effect by the\r\nsalutary operation of the constitutional treasury. It is certain that if\r\nthe twenty-four millions of specie imported into the country during the\r\nfiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1847, had gone into the banks, as\r\nto a great extent it must have done, it would in the absence of this system\r\nhave been made the basis of augmented bank paper issues, probably to an\r\namount not less than $60,000,000 or $70,000,000, producing, as an\r\ninevitable consequence of an inflated currency, extravagant prices for a\r\ntime and wild speculation, which must have been followed, on the reflux to\r\nEurope the succeeding year of so much of that specie, by the prostration of\r\nthe business of the country, the suspension of the banks, and most\r\nextensive bankruptcies. Occurring, as this would have done, at a period\r\nwhen the country was engaged in a foreign war, when considerable loans of\r\nspecie were required for distant disbursements, and when the banks, the\r\nfiscal agents of the Government and the depositories of its money, were\r\nsuspended, the public credit must have sunk, and many millions of dollars,\r\nas was the case during the War of 1812, must have been sacrificed in\r\ndiscounts upon loans and upon the depreciated paper currency which the\r\nGovernment would have been compelled to use.\r\n\r\nUnder the operations of the constitutional treasury not a dollar has been\r\nlost by the depreciation of the currency. The loans required to prosecute\r\nthe war with Mexico were negotiated by the Secretary of the Treasury above\r\npar, realizing a large premium to the Government. The restraining effect of\r\nthe system upon the tendencies to excessive paper issues by banks has saved\r\nthe Government from heavy losses and thousands of our business men from\r\nbankruptcy and ruin. The wisdom of the system has been tested by the\r\nexperience of the last two years, and it is the dictate of sound policy\r\nthat it should remain undisturbed. The modifications in some of the details\r\nof this measure, involving none of its essential principles, heretofore\r\nrecommended, are again presented for your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 6th of July last, transmitting to Congress the\r\nratified treaty of peace with Mexico, I recommended the adoption of\r\nmeasures for the speedy payment of the public debt. In reiterating that\r\nrecommendation I refer you to the considerations presented in that message\r\nin its support. The public debt, including that authorized to be negotiated\r\nin pursuance of existing laws, and including Treasury notes, amounted at\r\nthat time to $65,778,450.41.\r\n\r\nFunded stock of the United States amounting to about half a million of\r\ndollars has been purchased, as authorized by law, since that period, and\r\nthe public debt has thus been reduced, the details of which will be\r\npresented in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of expenditures for the next fiscal year, submitted by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, it is believed will be ample for all necessary\r\npurposes. If the appropriations made by Congress shall not exceed the\r\namount estimated, the means in the Treasury will be sufficient to defray\r\nall the expenses of the Government, to pay off the next installment of\r\n$3,000,000 to Mexico, which will fall due on the 30th of May next, and\r\nstill a considerable surplus will remain, which should be applied to the\r\nfurther purchase of the public stock and reduction of the debt. Should\r\nenlarged appropriations be made, the necessary consequence will be to\r\npostpone the payment of the debt. Though our debt, as compared with that of\r\nmost other nations, is small, it is our true policy, and in harmony with\r\nthe genius of our institutions, that we should present to the world the\r\nrare spectacle of a great Republic, possessing vast resources and wealth,\r\nwholly exempt from public indebtedness. This would add still more to our\r\nstrength, and give to us a still more commanding position among the nations\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures should be economical, and be confined to such\r\nnecessary objects as are clearly within the powers of Congress. All such as\r\nare not absolutely demanded should be postponed, and the payment of the\r\npublic debt at the earliest practicable period should be a cardinal\r\nprinciple of our public policy.\r\n\r\nFor the reason assigned in my last annual message, I repeat the\r\nrecommendation that a branch of the Mint of the United States be\r\nestablished at the city of New York. The importance of this measure is\r\ngreatly increased by the acquisition of the rich mines of the precious\r\nmetals in New Mexico and California, and especially in the latter.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation heretofore made in favor of the graduation and\r\nreduction of the price of such of the public lands as have been long\r\noffered in the market and have remained unsold, and in favor of extending\r\nthe rights of preemption to actual settlers on the unsurveyed as well as\r\nthe surveyed lands.\r\n\r\nThe condition and operations of the Army and the state of other branches of\r\nthe public service under the supervision of the War Department are\r\nsatisfactorily presented in the accompanying report of the Secretary of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nOn the return of peace our forces were withdrawn from Mexico, and the\r\nvolunteers and that portion of the Regular Army engaged for the war were\r\ndisbanded. Orders have been issued for stationing the forces of our\r\npermanent establishment at various positions in our extended country where\r\ntroops may be required. Owing to the remoteness of some of these positions,\r\nthe detachments have not yet reached their destination. Notwithstanding the\r\nextension of the limits of our country and the forces required in the new\r\nterritories, it is confidently believed that our present military\r\nestablishment is sufficient for all exigencies so long as our peaceful\r\nrelations remain undisturbed.\r\n\r\nOf the amount of military contributions collected in Mexico, the sum of\r\n$769,650 was applied toward the payment of the first installment due under\r\nthe treaty with Mexico. The further sum of $346,369.30 has been paid into\r\nthe Treasury, and unexpended balances still remain in the hands of\r\ndisbursing officers and those who were engaged in the collection of these\r\nmoneys. After the proclamation of peace no further disbursements were made\r\nof any unexpended moneys arising from this source. The balances on hand\r\nwere directed to be paid into the Treasury, and individual claims on the\r\nfund will remain unadjusted until Congress shall authorize their settlement\r\nand payment. These claims are not considerable in number or amount.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the suggestions of the\r\nSecretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy in regard to legislation on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nOur Indian relations are presented in a most favorable view in the report\r\nfrom the War Department. The wisdom of our policy in regard to the tribes\r\nwithin our limits is clearly manifested by their improved and rapidly\r\nimproving condition.\r\n\r\nA most important treaty with the Menomonies has been recently negotiated by\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs in person, by which all their land in\r\nthe State of Wisconsin--being about 4,000,000 acres--has been ceded to the\r\nUnited States. This treaty will be submitted to the Senate for ratification\r\nat an early period of your present session.\r\n\r\nWithin the last four years eight important treaties have been negotiated\r\nwith different Indian tribes, and at a cost of $1,842,000; Indian lands to\r\nthe amount of more than 18,500,000 acres have been ceded to the United\r\nStates, and provision has been made for settling in the country west of the\r\nMississippi the tribes which occupied this large extent of the public\r\ndomain. The title to all the Indian lands within the several States of our\r\nUnion, with the exception of a few small reservations, is now extinguished,\r\nand a vast region opened for settlement and cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy gives a satisfactory\r\nexhibit of the operations and condition of that branch of the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nA number of small vessels, suitable for entering the mouths of rivers, were\r\njudiciously purchased during the war, and gave great efficiency to the\r\nsquadron in the Gulf of Mexico. On the return of peace, when no longer\r\nvaluable for naval purposes, and liable to constant deterioration, they\r\nwere sold and the money placed in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe number of men in the naval service authorized by law during the war has\r\nbeen reduced by discharges below the maximum fixed for the peace\r\nestablishment. Adequate squadrons are maintained in the several quarters of\r\nthe globe where experience has shown their services may be most usefully\r\nemployed, and the naval service was never in a condition of higher\r\ndiscipline or greater efficiency.\r\n\r\nI invite attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy on\r\nthe subject of the Marine Corps. The reduction of the Corps at the end of\r\nthe war required that four officers of each of the three lower grades\r\nshould be dropped from the rolls. A board of officers made the selection,\r\nand those designated were necessarily dismissed, but without any alleged\r\nfault. I concur in opinion with the Secretary that the service would be\r\nimproved by reducing the number of landsmen and increasing the marines.\r\nSuch a measure would justify an increase of the number of officers to the\r\nextent of the reduction by dismissal, and still the Corps would have fewer\r\nofficers than a corresponding number of men in the Army.\r\n\r\nThe contracts for the transportation of the mail in steamships, convertible\r\ninto war steamers, promise to realize all the benefits to our commerce and\r\nto the Navy which were anticipated. The first steamer thus secured to the\r\nGovernment was launched in January, 1847. There are now seven, and in\r\nanother year there will probably be not less than seventeen afloat. While\r\nthis great national advantage is secured, our social and commercial\r\nintercourse is increased and promoted with Germany, Great Britain, and\r\nother parts of Europe, with all the countries on the west coast of our\r\ncontinent, especially with Oregon and California, and between the northern\r\nand southern sections of the United States. Considerable revenue may be\r\nexpected from postages, but the connected line from New York to Chagres,\r\nand thence across the Isthmus to Oregon, can not fail to exert a beneficial\r\ninfluence, not now to be estimated, on the interests of the manufactures,\r\ncommerce, navigation, and currency of the United States. As an important\r\npart of the system, I recommend to your favorable consideration the\r\nestablishment of the proposed line of steamers between New Orleans and Vera\r\nCruz. It promises the most happy results in cementing friendship between\r\nthe two Republics and extending reciprocal benefits to the trade and\r\nmanufactures of both.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General will make known to you the operations\r\nof that Department for the past year.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to find the revenues of the Department, under the rates of\r\npostage now established by law, so rapidly increasing. The gross amount of\r\npostages during the last fiscal year amounted to $4,371,077, exceeding the\r\nannual average received for the nine years immediately preceding the\r\npassage of the act of the 3d of March, 1845, by the sum of $6,453, and\r\nexceeding the amount received for the year ending the 30th of June, 1847,\r\nby the sum of $425,184.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the year, excluding the sum of $94,672, allowed by\r\nCongress at its last session to individual claimants, and including the sum\r\nof $100,500, paid for the services of the line of steamers between Bremen\r\nand New York, amounted to $4,198,845, which is less than the annual average\r\nfor the nine years previous to the act of 1845 by $300,748.\r\n\r\nThe mail routes on the 30th day of June last were 163,208 miles in extent,\r\nbeing an increase during the last year of 9,390 miles. The mails were\r\ntransported over them during the same time 41,012,579 miles, making an\r\nincrease of transportation for the year of 2,124,680 miles, whilst the\r\nexpense was less than that of the previous year by $4,235.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the mail transportation within the last three years has\r\nbeen 5,378,310 miles, whilst the expenses were reduced $456,738, making an\r\nincrease of service at the rate of 15 per cent and a reduction in the\r\nexpenses of more than 15 per cent.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year there have been employed, under contracts with the\r\nPost-Office Department, two ocean steamers in conveying the mails monthly\r\nbetween New York and Bremen, and one, since October last, performing\r\nsemimonthly service between Charleston and Havana; and a contract has been\r\nmade for the transportation of the Pacific mails across the Isthmus from\r\nChagres to Panama.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority given to the Secretary of the Navy, three ocean\r\nsteamers have been constructed and sent to the Pacific, and are expected to\r\nenter upon the mail service between Panama and Oregon and the intermediate\r\nports on the 1st of January next; and a fourth has been engaged by him for\r\nthe service between Havana and Chagres, so that a regular monthly mail line\r\nwill be kept up after that time between the United States and our\r\nterritories on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this great increase in the mail service, should the revenue\r\ncontinue to increase the present year as it did in the last, there will be\r\nreceived near $450,000 more than the expenditures.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have satisfied the Postmaster-General that, with\r\ncertain modifications of the act of 1845, the revenue may be still further\r\nincreased and a reduction of postages made to a uniform rate of 5 cents,\r\nwithout an interference with the principle, which has been constantly and\r\nproperly enforced, of making that Department sustain itself.\r\n\r\nA well-digested cheap-postage system is the best means of diffusing\r\nintelligence among the people, and is of so much importance in a country so\r\nextensive as that of the United States that I recommend to your favorable\r\nconsideration the suggestions of the Postmaster-General for its\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nNothing can retard the onward progress of our country and prevent us from\r\nassuming and maintaining the first rank among nations but a disregard of\r\nthe experience of the past and a recurrence to an unwise public policy. We\r\nhave just closed a foreign war by an honorable peace--a war rendered\r\nnecessary and unavoidable in vindication of the national rights and honor.\r\nThe present condition of the country is similar in some respects to that\r\nwhich existed immediately after the close of the war with Great Britain in\r\n1815, and the occasion is deemed to be a proper one to take a retrospect of\r\nthe measures of public policy which followed that war. There was at that\r\nperiod of our history a departure from our earlier policy. The enlargement\r\nof the powers of the Federal Government by construction, which obtained,\r\nwas not warranted by any just interpretation of the Constitution. A few\r\nyears after the close of that war a series of measures was adopted which,\r\nunited and combined, constituted what was termed by their authors and\r\nadvocates the \"American system.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the new policy was for a time favored by the condition\r\nof the country, by the heavy debt which had been contracted during the war,\r\nby the depression of the public credit, by the deranged state of the\r\nfinances and the currency, and by the commercial and pecuniary\r\nembarrassment which extensively prevailed. These were not the only causes\r\nwhich led to its establishment. The events of the war with Great Britain\r\nand the embarrassments which had attended its prosecution had left on the\r\nminds of many of our statesmen the impression that our Government was not\r\nstrong enough, and that to wield its resources successfully in great\r\nemergencies, and especially in war, more power should be concentrated in\r\nits hands. This increased power they did not seek to obtain by the\r\nlegitimate and prescribed mode--an amendment of the Constitution--but by\r\nconstruction. They saw Governments in the Old World based upon different\r\norders of society, and so constituted as to throw the whole power of\r\nnations into the hands of a few, who taxed and controlled the many without\r\nresponsibility or restraint. In that arrangement they conceived the\r\nstrength of nations in war consisted. There was also something fascinating\r\nin the ease, luxury, and display of the higher orders, who drew their\r\nwealth from the toil of the laboring millions. The authors of the system\r\ndrew their ideas of political economy from what they had witnessed in\r\nEurope, and particularly in Great Britain. They had viewed the enormous\r\nwealth concentrated in few hands and had seen the splendor of the overgrown\r\nestablishments of an aristocracy which was upheld by the restrictive\r\npolicy. They forgot to look down upon the poorer classes of the English\r\npopulation, upon whose daily and yearly labor the great establishments they\r\nso much admired were sustained and supported. They failed to perceive that\r\nthe scantily fed and half-clad operatives were not only in abject poverty,\r\nbut were bound in chains of oppressive servitude for the benefit of favored\r\nclasses, who were the exclusive objects of the care of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to reconstruct society in the United States upon the\r\nEuropean plan. Here there was a written Constitution, by which orders and\r\ntitles were not recognized or tolerated. A system of measures was therefore\r\ndevised, calculated, if not intended, to withdraw power gradually and\r\nsilently from the States and the mass of the people, and by construction to\r\napproximate our Government to the European models, substituting an\r\naristocracy of wealth for that of orders and titles.\r\n\r\nWithout reflecting upon the dissimilarity of our institutions and of the\r\ncondition of our people and those of Europe, they conceived the vain idea\r\nof building up in the United States a system similar to that which they\r\nadmired abroad. Great Britain had a national bank of large capital, in\r\nwhose hands was concentrated the controlling monetary and financial power\r\nof the nation--an institution wielding almost kingly power, and exerting\r\nvast influence upon all the operations of trade and upon the policy of the\r\nGovernment itself. Great Britain had an enormous public debt, and it had\r\nbecome a part of her public policy to regard this as a \"public blessing.\"\r\nGreat Britain had also a restrictive policy, which placed fetters and\r\nburdens on trade and trammeled the productive industry of the mass of the\r\nnation. By her combined system of policy the landlords and other property\r\nholders were protected and enriched by the enormous taxes which were levied\r\nupon the labor of the country for their advantage. Imitating this foreign\r\npolicy, the first step in establishing the new system in the United States\r\nwas the creation of a national bank. Not foreseeing the dangerous power and\r\ncountless evils which such an institution might entail on the country, nor\r\nperceiving the connection which it was designed to form between the bank\r\nand the other branches of the miscalled \"American system,\" but feeling the\r\nembarrassments of the Treasury and of the business of the country\r\nconsequent upon the war, some of our statesmen who had held different and\r\nsounder views were induced to yield their scruples and, indeed, settled\r\nconvictions of its unconstitutionality, and to give it their sanction as an\r\nexpedient which they vainly hoped might produce relief. It was a most\r\nunfortunate error, as the subsequent history and final catastrophe of that\r\ndangerous and corrupt institution have abundantly proved. The bank, with\r\nits numerous branches ramified into the States, soon brought many of the\r\nactive political and commercial men in different sections of the country\r\ninto the relation of debtors to it and dependents upon it for pecuniary\r\nfavors, thus diffusing throughout the mass of society a great number of\r\nindividuals of power and influence to give tone to public opinion and to\r\nact in concert in cases of emergency. The corrupt power of such a political\r\nengine is no longer a matter of speculation, having been displayed in\r\nnumerous instances, but most signally in the political struggles of 1832,\r\n1833, and 1834 in opposition to the public will represented by a fearless\r\nand patriotic President.\r\n\r\nBut the bank was but one branch of the new system. A public debt of more\r\nthan $120,000,000 existed, and it is not to be disguised that many of the\r\nauthors of the new system did not regard its speedy payment as essential to\r\nthe public prosperity, but looked upon its continuance as no national evil.\r\nWhilst the debt existed it furnished aliment to the national bank and\r\nrendered increased taxation necessary to the amount of the interest,\r\nexceeding $7,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThis operated in harmony with the next branch of the new system, which was\r\na high protective tariff. This was to afford bounties to favored classes\r\nand particular pursuits at the expense of all others. A proposition to tax\r\nthe whole people for the purpose of enriching a few was too monstrous to be\r\nopenly made. The scheme was therefore veiled under the plausible but\r\ndelusive pretext of a measure to protect \"home industry,\" and many of our\r\npeople were for a time led to believe that a tax which in the main fell\r\nupon labor was for the benefit of the laborer who paid it. This branch of\r\nthe system involved a partnership between the Government and the favored\r\nclasses, the former receiving the proceeds of the tax imposed on articles\r\nimported and the latter the increased price of similar articles produced at\r\nhome, caused by such tax. It is obvious that the portion to be received by\r\nthe favored classes would, as a general rule, be increased in proportion to\r\nthe increase of the rates of tax imposed and diminished as those rates were\r\nreduced to the revenue standard required by the wants of the Government.\r\nThe rates required to produce a sufficient revenue for the ordinary\r\nexpenditures of Government for necessary purposes were not likely to give\r\nto the private partners in this scheme profits sufficient to satisfy their\r\ncupidity, and hence a variety of expedients and pretexts were resorted to\r\nfor the purpose of enlarging the expenditures and thereby creating a\r\nnecessity for keeping up a high protective tariff. The effect of this\r\npolicy was to interpose artificial restrictions upon the natural course of\r\nthe business and trade of the country, and to advance the interests of\r\nlarge capitalists and monopolists at the expense of the great mass of the\r\npeople, who were taxed to increase their wealth.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of this system was a comprehensive scheme of internal\r\nimprovements, capable of indefinite enlargement and sufficient to swallow\r\nup as many millions annually as could be exacted from the foreign commerce\r\nof the country. This was a convenient and necessary adjunct of the\r\nprotective tariff. It was to be the great absorbent of any surplus which\r\nmight at any time accumulate in the Treasury and of the taxes levied on the\r\npeople, not for necessary revenue purposes, but for the avowed object of\r\naffording protection to the favored classes.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary to the same end, if it was not an essential part of the system\r\nitself, was the scheme, which at a later period obtained, for distributing\r\nthe proceeds of the sales of the public lands among the States. Other\r\nexpedients were devised to take money out of the Treasury and prevent its\r\ncoming in from any other source than the protective tariff. The authors and\r\nsupporters of the system were the advocates of the largest expenditures,\r\nwhether for necessary or useful purposes or not, because the larger the\r\nexpenditures the greater was the pretext for high taxes in the form of\r\nprotective duties.\r\n\r\nThese several measures were sustained by popular names and plausible\r\narguments, by which thousands were deluded. The bank was represented to be\r\nan indispensable fiscal agent for the Government; was to equalize exchanges\r\nand to regulate and furnish a sound currency, always and everywhere of\r\nuniform value. The protective tariff was to give employment to \"American\r\nlabor\" at advanced prices; was to protect \"home industry\" and furnish a\r\nsteady market for the farmer. Internal improvements were to bring trade\r\ninto every neighborhood and enhance the value of every man's property. The\r\ndistribution of the land money was to enrich the States, finish their\r\npublic works, plant schools throughout their borders, and relieve them from\r\ntaxation. But the fact that for every dollar taken out of the Treasury for\r\nthese objects a much larger sum was transferred from the pockets of the\r\npeople to the favored classes was carefully concealed, as was also the\r\ntendency, if not the ultimate design, of the system to build up an\r\naristocracy of wealth, to control the masses of society, and monopolize the\r\npolitical power of the country.\r\n\r\nThe several branches of this system were so intimately blended together\r\nthat in their operation each sustained and strengthened the others. Their\r\njoint operation was to add new burthens of taxation and to encourage a\r\nlargely increased and wasteful expenditure of public money. It was the\r\ninterest of the bank that the revenue collected and the disbursements made\r\nby the Government should be large, because, being the depository of the\r\npublic money, the larger the amount the greater would be the bank profits\r\nby its use. It was the interest of the favored classes, who were enriched\r\nby the protective tariff, to have the rates of that protection as high as\r\npossible, for the higher those rates the greater would be their advantage.\r\nIt was the interest of the people of all those sections and localities who\r\nexpected to be benefited by expenditures for internal improvements that the\r\namount collected should be as large as possible, to the end that the sum\r\ndisbursed might also be the larger. The States, being the beneficiaries in\r\nthe distribution of the land money, had an interest in having the rates of\r\ntax imposed by the protective tariff large enough to yield a sufficient\r\nrevenue from that source to meet the wants of the Government without\r\ndisturbing or taking from them the land fund; so that each of the branches\r\nconstituting the system had a common interest in swelling the public\r\nexpenditures. They had a direct interest in maintaining the public debt\r\nunpaid and increasing its amount, because this would produce an annual\r\nincreased drain upon the Treasury to the amount of the interest and render\r\naugmented taxes necessary. The operation and necessary effect of the whole\r\nsystem were to encourage large and extravagant expenditures, and thereby to\r\nincrease the public patronage, and maintain a rich and splendid government\r\nat the expense of a taxed and impoverished people.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that this scheme of enlarged taxation and expenditures, had\r\nit continued to prevail, must soon have converted the Government of the\r\nUnion, intended by its framers to be a plain, cheap, and simple\r\nconfederation of States, united together for common protection and charged\r\nwith a few specific duties, relating chiefly to our foreign affairs, into a\r\nconsolidated empire, depriving the States of their reserved rights and the\r\npeople of their just power and control in the administration of their\r\nGovernment. In this manner the whole form and character of the Government\r\nwould be changed, not by an amendment of the Constitution, but by resorting\r\nto an unwarrantable and unauthorized construction of that instrument.\r\n\r\nThe indirect mode of levying the taxes by a duty on imports prevents the\r\nmass of the people from readily perceiving the amount they pay, and has\r\nenabled the few who are thus enriched, and who seek to wield the political\r\npower of the country, to deceive and delude them. Were the taxes collected\r\nby a direct levy upon the people, as is the case in the States, this could\r\nnot occur.\r\n\r\nThe whole system was resisted from its inception by many of our ablest\r\nstatesmen, some of whom doubted its constitutionality and its expediency,\r\nwhile others believed it was in all its branches a flagrant and dangerous\r\ninfraction of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThat a national bank, a protective tariff--levied not to raise the revenue\r\nneeded, but for protection merely--internal improvements, and the\r\ndistribution of the proceeds of the sale of the public lands are measures\r\nwithout the warrant of the Constitution would, upon the maturest\r\nconsideration, seem to be clear. It is remarkable that no one of these\r\nmeasures, involving such momentous consequences, is authorized by any\r\nexpress grant of power in the Constitution. No one of them is \"incident to,\r\nas being necessary and proper for the execution of, the specific powers\"\r\ngranted by the Constitution. The authority under which it has been\r\nattempted to justify each of them is derived from inferences and\r\nconstructions of the Constitution which its letter and its whole object and\r\ndesign do not warrant. Is it to be conceived that such immense powers would\r\nhave been left by the framers of the Constitution to mere inferences and\r\ndoubtful constructions? Had it been intended to confer them on the Federal\r\nGovernment, it is but reasonable to conclude that it would have been done\r\nby plain and unequivocal grants. This was not done; but the whole structure\r\nof which the \"American system\" consisted was reared on no other or better\r\nfoundation than forced implications and inferences of power, which its\r\nauthors assumed might be deduced by construction from the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut it has been urged that the national bank, which constituted so\r\nessential a branch of this combined system of measures, was not a new\r\nmeasure, and that its constitutionality had been previously sanctioned,\r\nbecause a bank had been chartered in 1791 and had received the official\r\nsignature of President Washington. A few facts will show the just weight to\r\nwhich this precedent should be entitled as bearing upon the question of\r\nconstitutionality.\r\n\r\nGreat division of opinion upon the subject existed in Congress. It is well\r\nknown that President Washington entertained serious doubts both as to the\r\nconstitutionality and expediency of the measure, and while the bill was\r\nbefore him for his official approval or disapproval so great were these\r\ndoubts that he required \"the opinion in writing\" of the members of his\r\nCabinet to aid him in arriving at a decision. His Cabinet gave their\r\nopinions and were divided upon the subject, General Hamilton being in favor\r\nof and Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Randolph being opposed to the\r\nconstitutionality and expediency of the bank. It is well known also that\r\nPresident Washington retained the bill from Monday, the 14th, when it was\r\npresented to him, until Friday, the 25th of February, being the last moment\r\npermitted him by the Constitution to deliberate, when he finally yielded to\r\nit his reluctant assent and gave it his signature. It is certain that as\r\nlate as the 23d of February, being the ninth day after the bill was\r\npresented to him, he had arrived at no satisfactory conclusion, for on that\r\nday he addressed a note to General Hamilton in which he informs him that\r\n\"this bill was presented to me by the joint committee of Congress at 12\r\no'clock on Monday, the 14th instant,\" and he requested his opinion \"to what\r\nprecise period, by legal interpretation of the Constitution, can the\r\nPresident retain it in his possession before it becomes a law by the lapse\r\nof ten days.\" If the proper construction was that the day on which the bill\r\nwas presented to the President and the day on which his action was had upon\r\nit were both to be counted inclusive, then the time allowed him within\r\nwhich it would be competent for him to return it to the House in which it\r\noriginated with his objections would expire on Thursday, the 24th of\r\nFebruary. General Hamilton on the same day returned an answer, in which he\r\nstates:\r\n\r\nI give it as my opinion that you have ten days exclusive of that on which\r\nthe bill was delivered to you and Sundays; hence, in the present case if it\r\nis returned on Friday it will be in time.\r\n\r\nBy this construction, which the President adopted, he gained another day\r\nfor deliberation, and it was not until the 25th of February that he signed\r\nthe bill, thus affording conclusive proof that he had at last obtained his\r\nown consent to sign it not without great and almost insuperable difficulty.\r\nAdditional light has been recently shed upon the serious doubts which he\r\nhad on the subject, amounting at one time to a conviction that it was his\r\nduty to withhold his approval from the bill. This is found among the\r\nmanuscript papers of Mr. Madison, authorized to be purchased for the use of\r\nthe Government by an act of the last session of Congress, and now for the\r\nfirst time accessible to the public. From these papers it appears that\r\nPresident Washington, while he yet held the bank bill in his hands,\r\nactually requested Mr. Madison, at that time a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to prepare the draft of a veto message for him. Mr.\r\nMadison, at his request, did prepare the draft of such a message, and sent\r\nit to him on the 21st of February, 1791. A copy of this original draft, in\r\nMr. Madison's own handwriting, was carefully preserved by him, and is among\r\nthe papers lately purchased by Congress. It is preceded by a note, written\r\non the same sheet, which is also in Mr. Madison's handwriting, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFebruary 21, 1791.--Copy of a paper made out and sent to the President, at\r\nhis request, to be ready in case his judgment should finally decide against\r\nthe bill for incorporating a national bank, the bill being then before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAmong the objections assigned in this paper to the bill, and which were\r\nsubmitted for the consideration of the President, are the following:\r\n\r\nI object to the bill, because it is an essential principle of the\r\nGovernment that powers not delegated by the Constitution can not be\r\nrightfully exercised; because the power proposed by the bill to be\r\nexercised is not expressly delegated, and because I can not satisfy myself\r\nthat it results from any express power by fair and safe rules of\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the precedent of the bank of 1791 and the sanction of the\r\ngreat name of Washington, which has been so often invoked in its support,\r\nare greatly weakened by the development of these facts.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of that bank satisfied the country that it ought not to be\r\ncontinued, and at the end of twenty years Congress refused to recharter it.\r\nIt would have been fortunate for the country, and saved thousands from\r\nbankruptcy and ruin, had our public men of 1816 resisted the temporary\r\npressure of the times upon our financial and pecuniary interests and\r\nrefused to charter the second bank. Of this the country became abundantly\r\nsatisfied, and at the close of its twenty years' duration, as in the case\r\nof the first bank, it also ceased to exist. Under the repeated blows of\r\nPresident Jackson it reeled and fell, and a subsequent attempt to charter a\r\nsimilar institution was arrested by the veto of President Tyler.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, in yielding his signature to the charter of 1816, did so upon\r\nthe ground of the respect due to precedents; and, as he subsequently\r\ndeclared--\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States, though on the original question held to be\r\nunconstitutional, received the Executive signature.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that neither the bank of 1791 nor that of 1816 would have\r\nbeen chartered but for the embarrassments of the Government in its\r\nfinances, the derangement of the currency, and the pecuniary pressure which\r\nexisted, the first the consequence of the War of the Revolution and the\r\nsecond the consequence of the War of 1812. Both were resorted to in the\r\ndelusive hope that they would restore public credit and afford relief to\r\nthe Government and to the business of the country.\r\n\r\nThose of our public men who opposed the whole \"American system\" at its\r\ncommencement and throughout its progress foresaw and predicted that it was\r\nfraught with incalculable mischiefs and must result in serious injury to\r\nthe best interests of the country. For a series of years their wise\r\ncounsels were unheeded, and the system was established. It was soon\r\napparent that its practical operation was unequal and unjust upon different\r\nportions of the country and upon the people engaged in different pursuits.\r\nAll were equally entitled to the favor and protection of the Government. It\r\nfostered and elevated the money power and enriched the favored few by\r\ntaxing labor, and at the expense of the many. Its effect was to \"make the\r\nrich richer and the poor poorer.\" Its tendency was to create distinctions\r\nin society based on wealth and to give to the favored classes undue control\r\nand sway in our Government. It was an organized money power, which resisted\r\nthe popular will and sought to shape and control the public policy.\r\n\r\nUnder the pernicious workings of this combined system of measures the\r\ncountry witnessed alternate seasons of temporary apparent prosperity, of\r\nsudden and disastrous commercial revulsions, of unprecedented fluctuation\r\nof prices and depression of the great interests of agriculture, navigation,\r\nand commerce, of general pecuniary suffering, and of final bankruptcy of\r\nthousands. After a severe struggle of more than a quarter of a century, the\r\nsystem was overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe bank has been succeeded by a practical system of finance, conducted and\r\ncontrolled solely by the Government. The constitutional currency has been\r\nrestored, the public credit maintained unimpaired even in a period of a\r\nforeign war, and the whole country has become satisfied that banks,\r\nnational or State, are not necessary as fiscal agents of the Government.\r\nRevenue duties have taken the place of the protective tariff. The\r\ndistribution of the money derived from the sale of the public lands has\r\nbeen abandoned and the corrupting system of internal improvements, it is\r\nhoped, has been effectually checked.\r\n\r\nIt is not doubted that if this whole train of measures, designed to take\r\nwealth from the many and bestow it upon the few, were to prevail the effect\r\nwould be to change the entire character of the Government. One only danger\r\nremains. It is the seductions of that branch of the system which consists\r\nin internal improvements, holding out, as it does, inducements to the\r\npeople of particular sections and localities to embark the Government in\r\nthem without stopping to calculate the inevitable consequences. This branch\r\nof the system is so intimately combined and linked with the others that as\r\nsurely as an effect is produced by an adequate cause, if it be resuscitated\r\nand revived and firmly established it requires no sagacity to foresee that\r\nit will necessarily and speedily draw after it the reestablishment of a\r\nnational bank, the revival of a protective tariff, the distribution of the\r\nland money, and not only the postponement to the distant future of the\r\npayment of the present national debt, but its annual increase.\r\n\r\nI entertain the solemn conviction that if the internal-improvement branch\r\nof the \"American system\" be not firmly resisted at this time the whole\r\nseries of measures composing it will be speedily reestablished and the\r\ncountry be thrown back from its present high state of prosperity, which the\r\nexisting policy has produced, and be destined again to witness all the\r\nevils, commercial revulsions, depression of prices, and pecuniary\r\nembarrassments through which we have passed during the last twenty-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTo guard against consequences so ruinous is an object of high national\r\nimportance, involving, in my judgment, the continued prosperity of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI have felt it to be an imperative obligation to withhold my constitutional\r\nsanction from two bills which had passed the two Houses of Congress,\r\ninvolving the principle of the internal improvement branch of the \"American\r\nsystem\" and conflicting in their provisions with the views here expressed.\r\n\r\nThis power, conferred upon the President by the Constitution, I have on\r\nthree occasions during my administration of the executive department of the\r\nGovernment deemed it my duty to exercise, and on this last occasion of\r\nmaking to Congress an annual communication \"of the state of the Union\" it\r\nis not deemed inappropriate to review the principles and considerations\r\nwhich have governed my action. I deem this the more necessary because,\r\nafter the lapse of nearly sixty years since the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, the propriety of the exercise of this undoubted\r\nconstitutional power by the President has for the first time been drawn\r\nseriously in question by a portion of my fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that--\r\n\r\nEvery bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the\r\nSenate shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the\r\nUnited States. If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return\r\nit with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who\r\nshall enter the objections at large on their Journal and proceed to\r\nreconsider it.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the Constitution from infraction is the President's\r\nhighest duty. He is bound to discharge that duty at whatever hazard of\r\nincurring the displeasure of those who may differ with him in opinion. He\r\nis bound to discharge it as well by his obligations to the people who have\r\nclothed him with his exalted trust as by his oath of office, which he may\r\nnot disregard. Nor are the obligations of the President in any degree\r\nlessened by the prevalence of views different from his own in one or both\r\nHouses of Congress. It is not alone hasty and inconsiderate legislation\r\nthat he is required to check; but if at any time Congress shall, after\r\napparently full deliberation, resolve on measures which he deems subversive\r\nof the Constitution or of the vital interests of the country, it is his\r\nsolemn duty to stand in the breach and resist them. The President is bound\r\nto approve or disapprove every bill which passes Congress and is presented\r\nto him for his signature. The Constitution makes this his duty, and he can\r\nnot escape it if he would. He has no election. In deciding upon any bill\r\npresented to him he must exercise his own best judgment. If he can not\r\napprove, the Constitution commands him to return the bill to the House in\r\nwhich it originated with his objections, and if he fail to do this within\r\nten days (Sundays excepted) it shall become a law without his signature.\r\nRight or wrong, he may be overruled by a vote of two-thirds of each House,\r\nand in that event the bill becomes a law without his sanction. If his\r\nobjections be not thus overruled, the subject is only postponed, and is\r\nreferred to the States and the people for their consideration and decision.\r\nThe President's power is negative merely, and not affirmative. He can enact\r\nno law. The only effect, therefore, of his withholding his approval of a\r\nbill passed by Congress is to suffer the existing laws to remain unchanged,\r\nand the delay occasioned is only that required to enable the States and the\r\npeople to consider and act upon the subject in the election of public\r\nagents who will carry out their wishes and instructions. Any attempt to\r\ncoerce the President to yield his sanction to measures which he can not\r\napprove would be a violation of the spirit of the Constitution, palpable\r\nand flagrant, and if successful would break down the independence of the\r\nexecutive department and make the President, elected by the people and\r\nclothed by the Constitution with power to defend their rights, the mere\r\ninstrument of a majority of Congress. A surrender on his part of the powers\r\nwith which the Constitution has invested his office would effect a\r\npractical alteration of that instrument without resorting to the prescribed\r\nprocess of amendment.\r\n\r\nWith the motives or considerations which may induce Congress to pass any\r\nbill the President can have nothing to do. He must presume them to be as\r\npure as his own, and look only to the practical effect of their measures\r\nwhen compared with the Constitution or the public good.\r\n\r\nBut it has been urged by those who object to the exercise of this undoubted\r\nconstitutional power that it assails the representative principle and the\r\ncapacity of the people to govern themselves; that there is greater safety\r\nin a numerous representative body than in the single Executive created by\r\nthe Constitution, and that the Executive veto is a \"one-man power,\"\r\ndespotic in its character. To expose the fallacy of this objection it is\r\nonly necessary to consider the frame and true character of our system. Ours\r\nis not a consolidated empire, but a confederated union. The States before\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution were coordinate, co-equal, and separate\r\nindependent sovereignties, and by its adoption they did not lose that\r\ncharacter. They clothed the Federal Government with certain powers and\r\nreserved all others, including their own sovereignty, to themselves. They\r\nguarded their own rights as States and the rights of the people by the very\r\nlimitations which they incorporated into the Federal Constitution, whereby\r\nthe different departments of the General Government were checks upon each\r\nother. That the majority should govern is a general principle controverted\r\nby none, but they must govern according to the Constitution, and not\r\naccording to an undefined and unrestrained discretion, whereby they may\r\noppress the minority.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are not blind to the fact that they may be\r\ntemporarily misled, and that their representatives, legislative and\r\nexecutive, may be mistaken or influenced in their action by improper\r\nmotives. They have therefore interposed between themselves and the laws\r\nwhich may be passed by their public agents various representations, such as\r\nassemblies, senates, and governors in their several States, a House of\r\nRepresentatives, a Senate, and a President of the United States. The people\r\ncan by their own direct agency make no law, nor can the House of\r\nRepresentatives, immediately elected by them, nor can the Senate, nor can\r\nboth together without the concurrence of the President or a vote of\r\ntwo-thirds of both Houses.\r\n\r\nHappily for themselves, the people in framing our admirable system of\r\ngovernment were conscious of the infirmities of their representatives, and\r\nin delegating to them the power of legislation they have fenced them around\r\nwith checks to guard against the effects of hasty action, of error, of\r\ncombination, and of possible corruption. Error, selfishness, and faction\r\nhave often sought to rend asunder this web of checks and subject the\r\nGovernment to the control of fanatic and sinister influences, but these\r\nefforts have only satisfied the people of the wisdom of the checks which\r\nthey have imposed and of the necessity of preserving them unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe true theory of our system is not to govern by the acts or decrees of\r\nany one set of representatives. The Constitution interposes checks upon all\r\nbranches of the Government, in order to give time for error to be corrected\r\nand delusion to pass away; but if the people settle down into a firm\r\nconviction different from that of their representatives they give effect to\r\ntheir opinions by changing their public servants. The checks which the\r\npeople imposed on their public servants in the adoption of the Constitution\r\nare the best evidence of their capacity for self-government. They know that\r\nthe men whom they elect to public stations are of like infirmities and\r\npassions with themselves, and not to be trusted without being restricted by\r\ncoordinate authorities and constitutional limitations. Who that has\r\nwitnessed the legislation of Congress for the last thirty years will say\r\nthat he knows of no instance in which measures not demanded by the public\r\ngood have been carried? Who will deny that in the State governments, by\r\ncombinations of individuals and sections, in derogation of the general\r\ninterest, banks have been chartered, systems of internal improvements\r\nadopted, and debts entailed upon the people repressing their growth and\r\nimpairing their energies for years to come?\r\n\r\nAfter so much experience it can not be said that absolute unchecked power\r\nis safe in the hands of any one set of representatives, or that the\r\ncapacity of the people for self-government, which is admitted in its\r\nbroadest extent, is a conclusive argument to prove the prudence, wisdom,\r\nand integrity of their representatives.\r\n\r\nThe people, by the Constitution, have commanded the President, as much as\r\nthey have commanded the legislative branch of the Government, to execute\r\ntheir will. They have said to him in the Constitution, which they require\r\nhe shall take a solemn oath to support, that if Congress pass any bill\r\nwhich he can not approve \"he shall return it to the House in which it\r\noriginated with his objections.\" In withholding from it his approval and\r\nsignature he is executing the will of the people, constitutionally\r\nexpressed, as much as the Congress that passed it. No bill is presumed to\r\nbe in accordance with the popular will until it shall have passed through\r\nall the branches of the Government required by the Constitution to make it\r\na law. A bill which passes the House of Representatives may be rejected by\r\nthe Senate, and so a bill passed by the Senate may be rejected by the\r\nHouse. In each case the respective Houses exercise the veto power on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nCongress, and each House of Congress, hold under the Constitution a check\r\nupon the President, and he, by the power of the qualified veto, a check\r\nupon Congress. When the President recommends measures to Congress, he avows\r\nin the most solemn form his opinions, gives his voice in their favor, and\r\npledges himself in advance to approve them if passed by Congress. If he\r\nacts without due consideration, or has been influenced by improper or\r\ncorrupt motives, or if from any other cause Congress, or either House of\r\nCongress, shall differ with him in opinion, they exercise their veto upon\r\nhis recommendations and reject them; and there is no appeal from their\r\ndecision but to the people at the ballot box. These are proper checks upon\r\nthe Executive, wisely interposed by the Constitution. None will be found to\r\nobject to them or to wish them removed. It is equally important that the\r\nconstitutional checks of the Executive upon the legislative branch should\r\nbe preserved.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that the Representatives in the popular branch of Congress\r\nare chosen directly by the people, it is answered, the people elect the\r\nPresident. If both Houses represent the States and the people, so does the\r\nPresident. The President represents in the executive department the whole\r\npeople of the United States, as each member of the legislative department\r\nrepresents portions of them.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of restriction upon legislative and executive power, while a\r\nwell-settled public opinion is enabled within a reasonable time to\r\naccomplish its ends, has made our country what it is, and has opened to us\r\na career of glory and happiness to which all other nations have been\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the power of the veto the President is responsible not\r\nonly to an enlightened public opinion, but to the people of the whole\r\nUnion, who elected him, as the representatives in the legislative branches\r\nwho differ with him in opinion are responsible to the people of particular\r\nStates or districts, who compose their respective constituencies. To deny\r\nto the President the exercise of this power would be to repeal that\r\nprovision of the Constitution which confers it upon him. To charge that its\r\nexercise unduly controls the legislative will is to complain of the\r\nConstitution itself.\r\n\r\nIf the Presidential veto be objected to upon the ground that it checks and\r\nthwarts the popular will, upon the same principle the equality of\r\nrepresentation of the States in the Senate should be stricken out of the\r\nConstitution. The vote of a Senator from Delaware has equal weight in\r\ndeciding upon the most important measures with the vote of a Senator from\r\nNew York, and yet the one represents a State containing, according to the\r\nexisting apportionment of Representatives in the House of Representatives,\r\nbut one thirty-fourth part of the population of the other. By the\r\nconstitutional composition of the Senate a majority of that body from the\r\nsmaller States represent less than one-fourth of the people of the Union.\r\nThere are thirty States, and under the existing apportionment of\r\nRepresentatives there are 230 Members in the House of Representatives.\r\nSixteen of the smaller States are represented in that House by but 50\r\nMembers, and yet the Senators from these States constitute a majority of\r\nthe Senate. So that the President may recommend a measure to Congress, and\r\nit may receive the sanction and approval of more than three-fourths of the\r\nHouse of Representatives and of all the Senators from the large States,\r\ncontaining more than three-fourths of the whole population of the United\r\nStates, and yet the measure may be defeated by the votes of the Senators\r\nfrom the smaller States. None, it is presumed, can be found ready to change\r\nthe organization of the Senate on this account, or to strike that body\r\npractically out of existence by requiring that its action shall be\r\nconformed to the will of the more numerous branch.\r\n\r\nUpon the same principle that the veto of the President should be\r\npractically abolished the power of the Vice-President to give the casting\r\nvote upon an equal division of the Senate should be abolished also. The\r\nVice-President exercises the veto power as effectually by rejecting a bill\r\nby his casting vote as the President does by refusing to approve and sign\r\nit. This power has been exercised by the Vice-President in a few instances,\r\nthe most important of which was the rejection of the bill to recharter the\r\nBank of the United States in 1811. It may happen that a bill may be passed\r\nby a large majority of the House of Representatives, and may be supported\r\nby the Senators from the larger States, and the Vice-President may reject\r\nit by giving his vote with the Senators from the smaller States; and yet\r\nnone, it is presumed, are prepared to deny to him the exercise of this\r\npower under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut it is, in point of fact, untrue that an act passed by Congress is\r\nconclusive evidence that it is an emanation of the popular will. A majority\r\nof the whole number elected to each House of Congress constitutes a quorum,\r\nand a majority of that quorum is competent to pass laws. It might happen\r\nthat a quorum of the House of Representatives, consisting of a single\r\nmember more than half of the whole number elected to that House, might pass\r\na bill by a majority of a single vote, and in that case a fraction more\r\nthan one-fourth of the people of the United States would be represented by\r\nthose who voted for it. It might happen that the same bill might be passed\r\nby a majority of one of a quorum of the Senate, composed of Senators from\r\nthe fifteen smaller States and a single Senator from a sixteenth State; and\r\nif the Senators voting for it happened to be from the eight of the smallest\r\nof these States, it would be passed by the votes of Senators from States\r\nhaving but fourteen Representatives in the House of Representatives, and\r\ncontaining less than one-sixteenth of the whole population of the United\r\nStates. This extreme case is stated to illustrate the fact that the mere\r\npassage of a bill by Congress is no conclusive evidence that those who\r\npassed it represent the majority of the people of the United States or\r\ntruly reflect their will. If such an extreme case is not likely to happen,\r\ncases that approximate it are of constant occurrence. It is believed that\r\nnot a single law has been passed since the adoption of the Constitution\r\nupon which all the members elected to both Houses have been present and\r\nvoted. Many of the most important acts which have passed Congress have been\r\ncarried by a close vote in thin Houses. Many instances of this might be\r\ngiven. Indeed, our experience proves that many of the most important acts\r\nof Congress are postponed to the last days, and often the last hours, of a\r\nsession, when they are disposed of in haste, and by Houses but little\r\nexceeding the number necessary to form a quorum.\r\n\r\nBesides, in most of the States the members of the House of Representatives\r\nare chosen by pluralities, and not by majorities of all the voters in their\r\nrespective districts, and it may happen that a majority of that House may\r\nbe returned by a less aggregate vote of the people than that received by\r\nthe minority.\r\n\r\nIf the principle insisted on be sound, then the Constitution should be so\r\nchanged that no bill shall become a law unless it is voted for by members\r\nrepresenting in each House a majority of the whole people of the United\r\nStates. We must remodel our whole system, strike down and abolish not only\r\nthe salutary checks lodged in the executive branch, but must strike out and\r\nabolish those lodged in the Senate also, and thus practically invest the\r\nwhole power of the Government in a majority of a single assembly--a\r\nmajority uncontrolled and absolute, and which may become despotic. To\r\nconform to this doctrine of the right of majorities to rule, independent of\r\nthe checks and limitations of the Constitution, we must revolutionize our\r\nwhole system; we must destroy the constitutional compact by which the\r\nseveral States agreed to form a Federal Union and rush into consolidation,\r\nwhich must end in monarchy or despotism. No one advocates such a\r\nproposition, and yet the doctrine maintained, if carried out, must lead to\r\nthis result.\r\n\r\nOne great object of the Constitution in conferring upon the President a\r\nqualified negative upon the legislation of Congress was to protect\r\nminorities from injustice and oppression by majorities. The equality of\r\ntheir representation in the Senate and the veto power of the President are\r\nthe constitutional guaranties which the smaller States have that their\r\nrights will be respected. Without these guaranties all their interests\r\nwould be at the mercy of majorities in Congress representing the larger\r\nStates. To the smaller and weaker States, therefore, the preservation of\r\nthis power and its exercise upon proper occasions demanding it is of vital\r\nimportance. They ratified the Constitution and entered into the Union,\r\nsecuring to themselves an equal representation with the larger States in\r\nthe Senate; and they agreed to be bound by all laws passed by Congress upon\r\nthe express condition, and none other, that they should be approved by the\r\nPresident or passed, his objections to the contrary notwithstanding, by a\r\nvote of two-thirds of both Houses. Upon this condition they have a right to\r\ninsist as a part of the compact to which they gave their assent.\r\n\r\nA bill might be passed by Congress against the will of the whole people of\r\na particular State and against the votes of its Senators and all its\r\nRepresentatives. However prejudicial it might be to the interests of such\r\nState, it would be bound by it if the President shall approve it or it\r\nshall be passed by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses; but it has a right\r\nto demand that the President shall exercise his constitutional power and\r\narrest it if his judgment is against it. If he surrender this power, or\r\nfail to exercise it in a case where he can not approve, it would make his\r\nformal approval a mere mockery, and would be itself a violation of the\r\nConstitution, and the dissenting State would become bound by a law which\r\nhad not been passed according to the sanctions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the exercise of the veto power is founded upon an idea\r\nrespecting the popular will, which, if carried out, would annihilate State\r\nsovereignty and substitute for the present Federal Government a\r\nconsolidation directed by a supposed numerical majority. A revolution of\r\nthe Government would be silently effected and the States would be subjected\r\nto laws to which they had never given their constitutional consent.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is invested with the power to\r\ndeclare, and has declared, acts of Congress passed with the concurrence of\r\nthe Senate, the House of Representatives, and the approval of the President\r\nto be unconstitutional and void, and yet none, it is presumed, can be found\r\nwho will be disposed to strip this highest judicial tribunal under the\r\nConstitution of this acknowledged power--a power necessary alike to its\r\nindependence and the rights of individuals.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason that the Executive veto should, according to the\r\ndoctrine maintained, be rendered nugatory, and be practically expunged from\r\nthe Constitution, this power of the court should also be rendered nugatory\r\nand be expunged, because it restrains the legislative and Executive will,\r\nand because the exercise of such a power by the court may be regarded as\r\nbeing in conflict with the capacity of the people to govern themselves.\r\nIndeed, there is more reason for striking this power of the court from the\r\nConstitution than there is that of the qualified veto of the president,\r\nbecause the decision of the court is final, and can never be reversed even\r\nthough both Houses of Congress and the President should be unanimous in\r\nopposition to it, whereas the veto of the President may be overruled by a\r\nvote of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress or by the people at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that to preserve the system established by the Constitution\r\neach of the coordinate branches of the Government--the executive,\r\nlegislative, and judicial--must be left in the exercise of its appropriate\r\npowers. If the executive or the judicial branch be deprived of powers\r\nconferred upon either as checks on the legislative, the preponderance of\r\nthe latter will become disproportionate and absorbing and the others\r\nimpotent for the accomplishment of the great objects for which they were\r\nestablished. Organized, as they are, by the Constitution, they work\r\ntogether harmoniously for the public good. If the Executive and the\r\njudiciary shall be deprived of the constitutional powers invested in them,\r\nand of their due proportions, the equilibrium of the system must be\r\ndestroyed, and consolidation, with the most pernicious results, must\r\nensue--a consolidation of unchecked, despotic power, exercised by\r\nmajorities of the legislative branch.\r\n\r\nThe executive, legislative, and judicial each constitutes a separate\r\ncoordinate department of the Government, and each is independent of the\r\nothers. In the performance of their respective duties under the\r\nConstitution neither can in its legitimate action control the others. They\r\neach act upon their several responsibilities in their respective spheres.\r\nBut if the doctrines now maintained be correct, the executive must become\r\npractically subordinate to the legislative, and the judiciary must become\r\nsubordinate to both the legislative and the executive; and thus the whole\r\npower of the Government would be merged in a single department. Whenever,\r\nif ever, this shall occur, our glorious system of well-regulated\r\nself-government will crumble into ruins, to be succeeded, first by anarchy,\r\nand finally by monarchy or despotism. I am far from believing that this\r\ndoctrine is the sentiment of the American people; and during the short\r\nperiod which remains in which it will be my duty to administer the\r\nexecutive department it will be my aim to maintain its independence and\r\ndischarge its duties without infringing upon the powers or duties of either\r\nof the other departments of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Executive veto was exercised by the first and most\r\nillustrious of my predecessors and by four of his successors who preceded\r\nme in the administration of the Government, and it is believed in no\r\ninstance prejudicially to the public interests. It has never been and there\r\nis but little danger that it ever can be abused. No President will ever\r\ndesire unnecessarily to place his opinion in opposition to that of\r\nCongress. He must always exercise the power reluctantly, and only in cases\r\nwhere his convictions make it a matter of stern duty, which he can not\r\nescape. Indeed, there is more danger that the President, from the\r\nrepugnance he must always feel to come in collision with Congress, may fail\r\nto exercise it in cases where the preservation of the Constitution from\r\ninfraction, or the public good, may demand it than that he will ever\r\nexercise it unnecessarily or wantonly.\r\n\r\nDuring the period I have administered the executive department of the\r\nGovernment great and important questions of public policy, foreign and\r\ndomestic, have arisen, upon which it was my duty to act. It may, indeed, be\r\ntruly said that my Administration has fallen upon eventful times. I have\r\nfelt most sensibly the weight of the high responsibilities devolved upon\r\nme. With no other object than the public good, the enduring fame, and\r\npermanent prosperity of my country, I have pursued the convictions of my\r\nown best judgment. The impartial arbitrament of enlightened public opinion,\r\npresent and future, will determine how far the public policy I have\r\nmaintained and the measures I have from time to time recommended may have\r\ntended to advance or retard the public prosperity at home and to elevate or\r\ndepress the estimate of our national character abroad.\r\n\r\nInvoking the blessings of the Almighty upon your deliberations at your\r\npresent important session, my ardent hope is that in a spirit of harmony\r\nand concord you may be guided to wise results, and such as may redound to\r\nthe happiness, the honor, and the glory of our beloved country.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.
