Walter, Phila.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the object of this book to supply the means of forming an accurate\r\nidea of the American government. The author has adopted the proposition\r\nthat the highest style of government is one “_of_ the people, _by_ the\r\npeople, and _for_ the people,” and believes that a constant progress,\r\ncommencing in the earliest times, has reached its full development in\r\nthe Great Republic. He therefore traces THE FOOTPRINTS OF TIME through\r\nall history; notes the gradual unfolding of institutions, the rise and\r\nfall of empires, the causes that produced and destroyed the ancient\r\nrepublics, and the origin of the forces that give so much more strength\r\nand stability to modern civilization. All this he considers essential to\r\na correct appreciation of the wonderful events of our age and country.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to a close and clear analysis of the whole structure\r\nof the government. Each general division, with its sub-divisions, is\r\nexamined in detail, but successively; so that a definite picture of it,\r\nwith all its branches, operations, and relations to other parts, stands\r\nbefore the mind as a sharply defined whole. The Executive, Legislative,\r\nand Judicial divisions—the dependent parts of each kept in proper\r\nplace—come in order, one after the other, before the mind, the structure,\r\npowers and working of each being fully explained.\r\n\r\nThe book is indeed a compilation, and the matter in large part from\r\nofficial sources, but collected from an astonishingly large number of\r\nbooks, all of which are not to be found even in the largest public\r\nlibraries; but the labor and merit of gathering so much from all\r\ndirections and compressing a library into a form and compass so\r\nconvenient, and so well arranged, in so few and well chosen words, has\r\nbeen great indeed.\r\n\r\nAll the works heretofore brought before the public proposing to meet this\r\nwant have been fragmentary, or have treated at too great length but a\r\nportion of the subject. A complete summary, or Citizens’ Manual, is here\r\nfurnished, that includes a sufficiently detailed Analysis of the entire\r\nstructure of the government, developing in a clear and comprehensive\r\nmanner the organization, powers, relations, and mode of working of\r\neach department, small or large, the principles on which they rest and\r\nthe spirit that permeates them all. It lays our history so far under\r\ncontribution as to show us the occasion that produced each institution,\r\nthe gradual growth of the grand edifice and the causes that controlled\r\nand shaped the whole. In short, it gives us an adequate reason for the\r\nform of our institutions, even so far back as the earlier history of\r\nhumanity, when the tendencies that have borne this fruit first began to\r\nappear in human history.\r\n\r\n                                                           THE PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our happiness to live in an age whose master-pieces of\r\naccomplishment, in science, industry and commerce, put to shame the\r\nextravagant fictions of Oriental tales and the wonders ascribed to the\r\ngods and heroes of ancient mythology. The changes produced by recent\r\ninvestigations and discoveries are so vast and so rapid that it is\r\ndifficult to follow them or comprehend the power and thoroughness of\r\nthe transformations that are taking place in the world around us. The\r\napplications of steam and electricity astonish us by their wide spread\r\ninfluence on the condition and relations of men; the ease and speed of\r\nmovement and intercourse, constantly increasing, are ever putting us in\r\nnew and unfamiliar situations. We have hardly accustomed our thoughts\r\nand habits to one before we are hurried on into another. The constantly\r\nclearer and more abundant light shed by science and the press does not\r\nsuffice to keep our minds fully up to the progress that goes on in all\r\ndepartments of life.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that we have entered on a New Era, the most extraordinary\r\nand momentous the world has ever seen. The old and imperfect is being\r\ncleared away and everything thoroughly reconstructed. The explanation is\r\nthat we are now setting up the grand Temple of Civilization, the separate\r\nstones and pillars of which each nation and age was commissioned to hew\r\nand carve, and, so to speak, left in the quarry to await the time when,\r\nall the material being ready, the Master Builder should collect all the\r\nscattered parts and raise the whole edifice at once, to the astonishment\r\nand joy of mankind.\r\n\r\nAll the institutions and civilizations of the past may be considered\r\ntemporary, erected in haste from the materials nearest at hand, not for\r\npermanence, but to serve the present turn while the special task of the\r\nnation or age was being performed. The races and ages nearer the birth\r\nof mankind worked on rougher parts of the edifice, that entered into the\r\nfoundations; those grand races, the Greek and the Roman, furnished the\r\nnoble outline which the nations of modern Europe perfected while they\r\nsupplied what was still lacking for use and adornment.\r\n\r\nAmerica was reserved, designedly, for so many ages, to furnish a suitable\r\nand unencumbered location for the central halls and mightiest pillars\r\nof the completed structure. Our fathers cleared the ground and laid\r\nthe foundation deep down on the living rock, that is to say, on Human\r\nRights. That they seldom failed to place stone, pillar and column in just\r\nposition the work, as we find it, proves, and we have little to do but to\r\nclear away the rubbish, beautify the grounds, and put the whole to its\r\nproper use.\r\n\r\nWe begin to see that Time, Thought and Experience have not wrought in\r\nvain, that Progress is not a phantom of the imagination, that the human\r\nrace is essentially a Unit, that it has been growing through all the\r\ncenturies and is now approaching the prime of its manhood, just ready\r\nto enter on its special career with its grandest work still to do. The\r\nenergies of all the races are preparing for unheard of achievements. The\r\nworld was never so completely and so wisely busy as now, and America\r\nstands between modern Europe and ancient Asia, receiving from, and\r\ngiving to, both. Her institutions are founded on principles so just\r\nand so humane that, when administered with due wisdom and skill, they\r\nwill embarrass and restrain the proper activities of men at _no point_.\r\nAmerica stands a _model_ which other nations will carefully copy, in due\r\ntime, as they can adapt themselves and change their institutions. It may\r\nnot be a _literal_ copy, a servile imitation; but there is little doubt\r\nthat our Declaration of Independence will finally enter, in spirit and\r\npotential influence, into the intimate structure of all governments.\r\n\r\nIt is the Course of Human Progress, and the important elements that were\r\nsuccessively added as each leading phase of civilization appeared, that\r\nis endeavored to be traced in the Historical Review of the First Part of\r\nthis book. While following the general march of events chronologically,\r\nwe have stopped here and there to take a general survey, in order the\r\nbetter to understand the significance of detached facts, or to examine a\r\nnew influence that enters among the forces moulding the future. Our space\r\ndid not allow an exhaustive process; nor was it desirable. We have taken\r\nnote of only the more important landmarks of Progress. Too much detail\r\nwould confuse the mind by engaging it in an intricate mass of facts. It\r\nis the _thread_ of events, that joins the nations and ages together, or\r\nthe _channel_ by which they sent down to our day—from Asia to Europe, and\r\nfrom Europe to America—each their special contribution to the political\r\nwisdom and the free institutions of America, that we have endeavored to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nWe hope we have not underrated any people or any time, and that we have\r\nnot _overrated_ the value and glory of America. America is yet young. Its\r\nfounders, the authors of its Constitution, were unaware of the singular\r\nexcellence and nobility of their work. Like all other people, they built\r\naccording to their genius and instincts. Time only could show whether\r\nthey built for immortality. They feared and trembled over their work; but\r\nTime has set on it his seal of approval. Our people are busy using their\r\nliberties and energies, each for his individual benefit, as is quite\r\nright and proper; since the welfare of individuals makes the prosperity\r\nof the community. But a government left to take care of itself is prone\r\nto do that work only too well. We have done well and wisely in important\r\ncrises; but a more intelligent and constant watchfulness over the\r\nordinary course of public affairs would have been still better.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the general mind among us has grown clearer and more\r\naccurate in its judgments as experience has accumulated, for the original\r\ndirection toward popular freedom has not changed. Various incongruities\r\nhave been laid aside and oversights corrected, the severe strain of\r\ncivil war and an unheard of rapidity of growth have not shaken, but\r\nmore clearly revealed the strength and unity of the nation. Yet, more\r\nintelligence and more care would have saved us many shocks and made our\r\nsuccess more pronounced and more brilliant. “Knowledge is power,” when\r\nwisely applied; and a more accurate acquaintance with their government\r\nand its history will enable American Citizens to mould it more wisely\r\nstill, to correct all defects of administration, and to speedily reach\r\nthat minimum of governmental interference with the efforts and interests\r\nof the citizens which shall give them the fullest liberty consistent with\r\nsecurity and surrender the whole round of human life, as completely as\r\npossible, to the beneficent action of natural law.\r\n\r\n                                                                    C.

The early traditions of every nation that has undertaken to relate the\r\nstory of its origin, have given us a confused account of supernatural\r\npersons and events which the judgment of more enlightened times has\r\nalmost uniformly considered fabulous and impossible. It has always been\r\nan interesting inquiry how much of fact was veiled under this mythical\r\ndress, and a great variety of ingenious and contradictory explanations\r\nhave been produced by the learned in all ages. In most cases, as in\r\nGreece, the national religion has been based on these legends which form\r\nits authority and explanation, and they passed with the people of all\r\nearly times as facts which it was impious to question. So the wise and\r\ngood Socrates was supposed to have denied the existence of the national\r\ngods, and was condemned to death. This sacred guard placed over early\r\ntraditions, increased at once the interest and the difficulty involved in\r\ntheir examination.\r\n\r\n2. During the present century the improved methods, larger range and more\r\nexact style of inquiry, and the assistance and hints which one branch\r\nof study has given to others, have produced the most surprising and\r\nsatisfactory results. These inquiries are not yet complete; they seem, on\r\nthe contrary, to have only commenced, and promise, ultimately, to satisfy\r\nall the useful purposes and legitimate curiosity of mankind; still, their\r\nconclusions, so far as they go, are unimpeachable. They prove themselves.\r\n\r\nThe study of Ethnology, which gives an account of the races of mankind;\r\na critical comparison of all languages, ancient and modern; the patient\r\nstudy and ingenious deciphering of architecture and inscriptions found\r\nin ancient ruins, and various relics of human activity imbedded in the\r\nsoil of different countries, have thrown down the barriers which the\r\nglowing imaginations of the poets and the want of authentic documents in\r\nearly times had raised, and have given us a clue to many of the secrets\r\nof history, and a safe guide through some of the dark passages of man’s\r\nprimitive life.\r\n\r\nTo show how this is done would require a treatise on Ethnology, another\r\non Comparative Philology, a third on Antiquarian Research, and a fourth\r\non the Geological Antiquities of Man. Each of these brings a large and\r\nvaluable contribution to early history. We give only a brief summary of\r\ntheir conclusions.\r\n\r\n3. The human race appears to have had its birth on the high table lands\r\nof central Asia, south and east of the Caspian Sea. The structure and\r\ngrowth of language, and the remains of early art, indicate an extremely\r\ninfantile mental condition and successive emigrations from the primitive\r\nhome of the race. Families and tribes which had remained together long\r\nenough to build up a common language and strong general features of\r\ncharacter and habit, at length separated and formed a number of families\r\nof allied races.\r\n\r\n4. The first emigrations were made by the Turanian nations, which\r\nscattered very widely. Turanian means “outside,” or “barbarian,” and was\r\ngiven by the later and better known races who found them, commonly in\r\na very wild, undeveloped state, wherever they themselves wandered in\r\nafter times. There are reasons for believing that the first Turanian\r\nmigration was to _China_; that they were never afterward much interfered\r\nwith, and that they early reached a high stage of civilization. It has\r\ncertainly many very crude and primitive features. Having worked out all\r\nthe progressive impulses dwelling in the primitive stock of their family\r\nalmost before other races were heard of, and being undisturbed, their\r\ninstitutions stiffened and crystalized and made few improvements for\r\nthousands of years. Chinese history presents a curious problem not yet\r\nfully investigated.\r\n\r\nAnother stream of Turanian emigration is believed to have settled the\r\nmore north-easterly portions of Asia. Some time after the tide set down\r\nthrough Farther India, and to the islands of Malaysia. In still later\r\nperiods Hindoostan was peopled by Turanian races; the ancestors of the\r\nMongols and Turks were spread over the vast plains of northern and\r\ncentral Asia; and somewhat later still an irruption into Europe furnished\r\nits primeval people. The Finns and Lapps in the north, and the Basques\r\nof Spain, are the living representatives of the ancient Turanian stock,\r\nwhile the Magyars, or Hungarians, are a modern branch of the same race,\r\nwhich made an irruption into Europe from Asia in the ninth century of the\r\nChristian era. The first appearance of this race in written history was\r\nin the establishment of a powerful empire at Babylon, which must have\r\nbeen cotemporary with the earliest Egyptian monarchy, and seems, from the\r\ninscriptions on the most ancient ruins, to have been conquered by, and\r\nmingled with, an Egyptian or Hamite family. It came to an end before the\r\nAssyrian Empire appeared, but seems to have reached a very considerable\r\ndegree of development.\r\n\r\n5. The other two great families of related languages, and therefore of\r\ncommon stock or race, are the Semitic and the Aryan. But previous to\r\nthe appearance of either of these on this buried stage of history is a\r\nfamily, apparently related, distantly, to the Semites, but who might have\r\nseparated from the common stock of both before them, called Hamites, who\r\nfounded the very ancient and mysterious Egyptian monarchy. A section of\r\nthis race conquered the Turanians of Babylon, and established the largest\r\ndominion then known to men. The Chedor-Laomer of Abraham’s day was one\r\nof its mightiest sovereigns, and ruled over a thickly-settled region a\r\nthousand miles in length by five hundred in breadth. Faint traces of\r\nit are found in profane history, and the Bible narrative is sustained\r\nand largely amplified by inscriptions on ancient ruins. A second Hamite\r\nempire in Babylon is believed to have followed this, continuing four\r\nhundred years, carrying agriculture and the peaceful arts to a high state\r\nof development.\r\n\r\n6. Egypt was peopled by the Hamitic race, who founded two kingdoms,\r\nafterwards united. Here, social, political, and industrial institutions\r\ndeveloped very early in great strength. Their language, the pictorial\r\nrepresentation of their social, political, and religious affairs, and\r\nthe grand and gloomy majesty of their works of art, imply a long period\r\nof growth before they reached the maturity in which we find them when\r\nwritten history commences. Their institutions, even in the earliest\r\nhistoric times, showed signs of the decrepitude and decay of age. The\r\nvastness and the grim maturity of their monuments and language seem to\r\nlend much support to their claim of an immense antiquity. The future\r\nstudy of their remains of art and literature will settle some important\r\nproblems in the chronology of the human race. The children of Ham were\r\nclearly the first to lead off in the march of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe Semitic family, deriving its name from Shem, or Sem, the eldest son\r\nof Noah, is not as large nor as widely spread as the Turanian and Aryan,\r\nbut has exerted an even greater influence on human destiny. It never\r\nstrayed much from Asia, except to people small portions of Africa. They\r\nearly appear in Western Asia as the successors of the second Hamitic\r\nempire in Babylon and Assyria. Settled in Phenicia, on the eastern shore\r\nof the Mediterranean sea, they became the first maritime and commercial\r\npeople, and, with their colony established in Carthage, in the north\r\nof Africa, exerted a powerful influence in promoting the civilization\r\nof the ancient world. The Semites early peopled the Arabian peninsula,\r\nand established a state in Ethiopia, as some believe, before Egypt had\r\nattained its full development. The Ethiopians established a flourishing\r\ncommerce on the Red Sea, with the eastern coasts of Africa, and with\r\nIndia, and contributed greatly to the resources of ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nThey have always been a religious race, and gave the three great\r\nreligions, Judaism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity, to the world, as\r\nwell as some of the most debasing superstitions and forms of idolatry\r\never known. The larger part of the population of Asia is still Turanian,\r\nand the Semites now occupy about the same area as in prehistoric times;\r\nbut the Hamites have been overpowered and have lost their clearly\r\ndistinctive character as a family, unless represented by the negro tribes.\r\n\r\n7. The third great family, the Aryan, called also the Japhetic, from\r\nJaphet, the third son of Noah, and from the regions they peopled and made\r\nillustrious by their genius and activity, the Indo-European, was the last\r\nto leave the birthplace of mankind. The other races were incapable of\r\ncarrying the fortunes of humanity beyond a certain point, of themselves\r\nalone, as the history of Turanian China, Hamitic Egypt and the Semitic\r\nMohammedans and Jews clearly proves. The history of the Aryans shows\r\nthem to possess inexhaustible mental power and physical stamina, with a\r\nvigorous ambition, always dissatisfied with the present, and constantly\r\nseeking something better in the future and the distant, that have\r\nproduced the happiest effect on the destinies of the human race.\r\n\r\n8. It would seem that while the Turanians, Hamites, and Semites were\r\ntaking the lead of the world and building up the empires of prehistoric\r\ntimes, whose mighty ruins have been the wonder of later ages, the Aryans\r\nwere all united in following peaceful pursuits, which the common features\r\nof their languages indicate were chiefly the care of flocks and herds.\r\nThey were much farther removed from barbarism than any of the other races\r\nwhen they began their wanderings. Warlike, agricultural and nautical\r\nterms, and the names of wild animals are not often found in the common\r\nvocabulary; while family relations, domestic animals and their uses, the\r\nheavenly bodies in connection with worship and the priestly relation of\r\nthe father of the family, and terms indicating a considerable cultivation\r\nof sensibility and thoughtfulness, imply a purer social and religious\r\ncondition, and more elevated mental traits, than in the primitive\r\nforefathers of the other families. Their language was highly picturesque,\r\nand its peculiar terms for natural phenomena are believed by some to have\r\noriginated the mythological histories of the ancient Greeks and Romans\r\nand Teutonic nations. The ancient language used epithets and names,\r\nso glowing with personality, that the imaginative descendants of the\r\nprimitive stock, when their early history was forgotten, believed them\r\nto contain an account of the origin of things, and the early deeds of\r\ngods and heroes; and the genius of the poets clothed the supposed marvels\r\nin the immortal dress of fiction which we find in Homer and Hesiod, in\r\nVirgil, the Indian Vedas, and the Sagas and Scalds of northern Europe.\r\nThis, at least, is the conclusion reached by some of the most eminent\r\nscholars and philologists, whose study of the formation and growth of\r\nlanguages has thrown so much light on the ante-historical periods. These\r\nmyths, the germs of which were embodied in their language, embellished\r\nby the supposed inspired genius of the poets, formed the literature and\r\ntheology of the early historic nations, and were received as undisputed\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n9. The first migration of the Aryan family appears to have occurred\r\nthrough the passes of the Caucasus, northwest to the northern part of\r\nAsia Minor and Southern Europe. The Turanian nations, or “barbarians,”\r\nwere everywhere found in advance of them, in a very degraded condition,\r\nand the native spirit and ambition of the Aryan people rendered them\r\nthe uniform conquerors. Afterward, another migration southward peopled\r\nIndia, and, in the earliest historic times, the part of the family still\r\nremaining in the ancient home of the race established the brilliant\r\nempire of the Medes and Persians, who extended their sway over all the\r\ncentral and western parts of Asia, broke down the ancient monarchy of\r\nEgypt, and, in the height of their power and glory, swept like a tempest\r\ninto Europe with the purpose of subjugating a few self-governing tribes\r\nof their own race dwelling on the shores and among the mountains of\r\nthe small peninsula of Greece. The failure of the mighty empire in\r\nthis effort, through the indomitable resolution of a handful of hardy\r\nrepublicans, forms one of the most glorious pages of history. It was a\r\ngrand era in the development of civilization, and Grecian culture became\r\nthe inheritance of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECTION OF PRE-HISTORIC GROWTH.\r\n\r\n1. The three classes of indications on which we rely for a knowledge of\r\nthe advance of mankind previous to the period when authentic history\r\ncomes to our aid—the researches of geologists among the accidental traces\r\nof man’s early activities, the ruins of ancient cities, and the study of\r\nthe growth of language—unite in testifying to an extremely rude, feeble\r\nand childish condition of the earliest representatives of the race,\r\nand to a progressive improvement in knowledge and capacity, precisely\r\nlike what occurs in the case of every individual of our kind. A fourth\r\nmore general observation also confirms this view. This is the obscurity\r\nthat covers the early ages. Aside from the Bible narrative, a cloud\r\nrests on the early history of every people. A long period passes before\r\nthey begin to reflect, to look around and back toward their origin,\r\nand still another of groping thought and study before they are led to\r\nrecord their reflections and experiences. The necessities and habit of\r\nsocial intercourse give rise to language and gradually mature it; a long\r\nperiod would necessarily pass before the natural aversion to other than\r\ndesultory labor, the increase of population and the habit of obedience to\r\nan authority requiring continued painful toil, would render the massive\r\nmonuments of some of the earlier peoples possible, and before their\r\nattempts at architecture could mature and originate the elaborate ruins\r\nwhich time has not been able to destroy during so many centuries.\r\n\r\n2. One of the most striking traits of pre-historic times is the\r\nsimplicity and awkwardness that characterize childhood. The Chinese\r\nlanguage has been remarked upon as showing the extremely infantile cast\r\nof mind among the people who formed and retained it to our times. Each\r\nword is a sentence, standing by itself originally; the tone and gesture\r\ngive it much of its signification. It would seem as if its authors had\r\nnever grown to the idea of an elaborated sentence. There is an average of\r\neight words, spelled and pronounced exactly alike, for every sound used.\r\nThere are, it is said, 212 characters pronounced _che_; 138 pronounced\r\n_foo_; and 1165 which all read _e_, and each letter is a word, a phrase\r\nand a sentence, and may be an adjective, a noun, or a verb, or all three\r\ntogether. The difficulty of expressing shades of meaning, or all that\r\nmay be in the thought, where so much must be acquired before expression\r\nis possible, has kept the Chinese mind, in many respects, in a state\r\nof childhood, though they have preserved a stability of character and\r\ninstitutions nowhere else observed. The primitive mind and habits are\r\nmaintained as if crystalized. The principle of decay, so universal\r\nelsewhere, would seem, by some singular process, banished from a vast\r\nnation, as it is in the human body in Egyptian mummies. The same feature\r\nis observable in a smaller degree among the Hindoos, and seems to have\r\ncharacterized the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\n3. Such a habit of fixity among the early races, whose position secured\r\nthem from disturbance by the more restless tribes, was favorable to the\r\nconstruction of the stupendous monuments which have been the wonder of\r\nafter ages. All those races have been remarkably exclusive. It was not\r\nuntil nearly four hundred years after the era of authentic history that\r\nEgypt was freely open to all the Greeks. These observations apply only\r\nto those portions of the human family which were stranded in some quiet\r\nnook outside of the current of movement that carried along the most of\r\nmankind. Change of place, intercourse, conflict and conquest were the\r\nchief early educators. The isolated nations, after exhausting the power\r\nof their first impulses, ceased to improve. Their minds, institutions and\r\nhabits stiffened and petrified. Nor did the families that wandered far\r\nfrom the general centre of movement usually acquire any high degree of\r\ndevelopment. They were characterized by unsettled habits; not favorable\r\nto highly organized institutions.\r\n\r\n4. It was around, and westward of, the common centre of the race that a\r\ncourse of steady improvement went on. Here the laws of inheritance and\r\nsuggestion, the stimulus of constant friction, and the infusion of newer\r\nand more enterprising blood worked the freest and developed the elements\r\nof a true civilization the soonest. If the legendary history of Greece is\r\nnot to be trusted in its details, it at least establishes the certainty\r\nof active movement and incessant conflict out of which was, at length,\r\nevolved a noble, if incomplete, civilization. The Greeks were near enough\r\nto the scene of stirring action in Western Asia to be benefited by its\r\ninfluence without having their institutions frequently disturbed and\r\nbroken up before they had reached any degree of maturity, as was the\r\ncase with the Assyrians, Persians and Phenicians. They reaped the fruit,\r\nwithout sharing the disasters, of the great surgings back and forward\r\nwhich we find to have been the condition of the Asiatic peoples at the\r\ntime reliable history begins to observe them. It appears to have been the\r\nsame in that region (Western Asia) as far back as monument, legend, or\r\nscience can trace. The fruit of this shock of races and mental activity\r\nmatured on the spot the greatest and best religious systems the world\r\nhas ever known, the three greatest of which have survived to our own\r\nday, viz.: the Judaic, the Christian and the Mohammedan. The germs of the\r\nother two were contained in the system of Abraham and Moses. Thus the\r\nthree most important influences needed for the progress of civilization\r\nin the true direction were supplied in pre-historic times—the seething\r\nand surging of the nations in the West of Asia, a high religious ideal,\r\nand the primary discipline of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n5. The lantern of science has guided us on the Track of Time by his\r\nadvancing Footprints down to the period when the grand luminary, Written\r\nHistory, begins to shine from the hills of Greece. Looking over what was\r\nthen known of Asia we find it a vast battlefield, on the western border\r\nof which were the Jews, receiving lessons of instruction or chastisement\r\nfrom the surrounding nations, and slowly evolving the Master Religion of\r\nthe world, the massive grandeur of Egypt is dimly visible in the south,\r\nand on the eastern horizon rise the immense walls and towers of the huge\r\ncities of Nineveh and Babylon. On the north and west all is darkness,\r\nthough we subsequently learn that the elements of a high culture among\r\nthe Etrurians of Italy were waiting their destruction at the hands of\r\nvaliant Rome, yet to be. The Phenicians were beginning to scour the sea\r\nand to build up a flourishing commerce, and the cities of Greece had\r\nalready learned, from the tyranny of their petty kings, the advantages of\r\nfree government.\r\n\r\nThe period of authentic history is held to have commenced seven hundred\r\nand seventy-six years before the Christian era. In that year the Greeks\r\nbegan to record the name of the conqueror in the Olympian games—a\r\nnational and religious festival, which had been commenced long before—and\r\nit was called the First Olympiad. It formed the first definite starting\r\npoint of the true and fairly reliable historians who, some four hundred\r\nyears later, began to write a carefully-studied account of what was\r\nknown of their own and of other countries. It was the time when dates of\r\npassing events first began to be stated in the records of the cities and\r\nkingdoms of Greece, and marks the beginning of a real civilization and\r\nculture, and the course of events began to be rescued from the magnifying\r\nand marvel-loving imaginations of the people.\r\n\r\n6. The seven hundred and fifty years that follow are in the highest\r\ndegree interesting and important; for they record the achievements of\r\nthe early manhood of humanity, as represented by the nations that were\r\nmost advanced in civilization, or contributed to the general progress of\r\nthe world. Men developed their inherent capacities far more during that\r\nperiod than in all the previous centuries, however numerous they may have\r\nbeen. It was followed by about five hundred years of gradual decline, and\r\nthat by a thousand years of confusion caused by the corruption of the old\r\nsociety and the imperfection of its elements, together with the irruption\r\nof vast hordes of barbarians, who brought in fresh and vigorous, but\r\nuntamed blood, with rude and fierce manners. They were gradually tamed\r\nby fusion with the cultured races, and out of this union arose a\r\ncivilization broader and more just, toward the perfection of which we\r\nourselves are now rapidly advancing, and which, by its multiform vigor\r\nand unlimited resources, seems above the reach of decay. Its power of\r\ninfusing new life into worn-out peoples and renewing the youth of nations\r\nas well as of civilizing barbarians appears irresistible.\r\n\r\nFrom this outlook we return to consider the steps by which Time has led\r\nus to such a desirable eminence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nTHE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Man, at first, had no institutions. He existed in the simplest and\r\nmost spontaneous way, finding shelter in caves and clefts of the rocks\r\nand beneath the primeval forests, groping his way by strong instincts\r\nwhich soon began to dawn into intelligence of the lowest and most\r\nmaterial kind. How long he led a purely _animal_ life we have no means\r\nof knowing; but we may suppose that the necessities of self-preservation\r\nand his powerful social instincts very soon developed the germs of the\r\nfamily and of language.\r\n\r\nChildhood is comparatively long, and many generations must have passed\r\nbefore language could have acquired the distinctness and fixity that\r\npermitted it to come down through so long a period, and by so many\r\ndifferent channels, to us. Yet there is plain evidence of an Eastern\r\norigin of all the various families of the race, and of a considerable\r\nmental development previous to the wanderings that peopled the East,\r\nthe West, and the South. It has been remarked by Geologists that the\r\nintroduction of any class of animal life was never made by its very\r\n_lowest_ orders, but usually by a class intermediate in organization\r\nbetween the highest and the lowest; some of the very lowest orders being\r\nrepresented in our own time.\r\n\r\n2. A tolerably hardy race, which could endure the exposures and overcome\r\nthe difficulties that must be greater for the first few generations than\r\never afterward, as we have every reason to believe, was first introduced.\r\nIt has been common to suppose that man must have been supplied with a\r\nfund of knowledge, and a basis of language, to have successfully met the\r\ndifficulties of his condition; but the uniform law that the _faculties_,\r\nthe _innate capabilities_ of his race, are conferred on him, and that he\r\nworks them out by a process of development is observable in his entire\r\nhistory, so far as we can trace it. All needful capacities being lodged\r\nin him, with strong appetites and instincts to impel him to the objects\r\nmost vitally necessary to his own preservation and the continuance of his\r\nspecies, and the material from which to work out his predestined ends\r\nbeing placed within his reach, it is made his indispensable duty and his\r\nglory to realize those ends, soon or late, by his own endeavors. The\r\nevidences of his early activity, unearthed here and there by geologists,\r\nshow him to have advanced by degrees from the lowest points, and such\r\ncorroborative proof as the earliest forms of language afford are\r\ndecidedly in the same direction.\r\n\r\n3. Many of the terms employed for the first and most familiar objects\r\nwith which the necessities of life brought him in contact, show the very\r\nimperfect extent of his early knowledge and resources, and they gradually\r\nchange in a way to indicate, most significantly, a slow and laborious,\r\nbut constant enlargement of ideas by experience. He advanced then,\r\nas now, by degrees. The races latest in development, as well as most\r\nvigorous and intelligent, were the Aryan, or Indo-European. They have\r\nleft the most definite traces of their early condition and advancement\r\nin the common elements of their various languages, which show very\r\nclearly how much time and toil were required to work out the features of\r\ntheir first Institution—The Family. The proper family type established\r\nrelations of protection and dependence, of care and trust, of purity\r\nand tenderness, of provident foresight, and the shelter and comforts of\r\nHome. Apparently it was many centuries after the other races had begun to\r\nmigrate that this last and most valuable stock commenced to be “fruitful\r\nand multiply,” to tame animals for their use, to enclose and render their\r\nhabitations comfortable, and to organize and designate their family\r\nrelations down to son-in-law and daughter-in-law, as well as to name the\r\nmost common domestic animals and occupations.\r\n\r\n4. The fact doubtless existed long before common experience and common\r\nconsent had settled on the terms that have remained the same in the\r\nlanguage of the Hindoos, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Germanic\r\nfamilies; but by many certain signs we know that it was only gradually\r\nthat the tenderness and beauty and usefulness of this institution had\r\nlaid the sure foundation of a future vigorous and virtuous civilization.\r\nThis race devoted themselves mainly to the care of flocks and herds,\r\nthough we find among them the knowledge of wheat and some other grains;\r\nthey had very little experience of war until they separated and began\r\ntheir wanderings, as we infer from the fact that their common terms are\r\nnearly all peaceful—those designating a warlike habit differing in all\r\nthe various branches of the stock.\r\n\r\nThe Family, with them, was usually founded on marriage—the union of one\r\nman and one woman—which laid great restraints on vice and preserved the\r\ngrowing society from manifold evils. The other races—Turanian, Hamitic\r\nand Semitic—appear to have been much more careless in this respect, and\r\nadmitted a vicious element into the base of society, which loosened the\r\nbonds of relationship and discipline. They practiced polygamy, which\r\nmagnified the position of the father, while it deprived him of the closer\r\nand more intimate relations to his household on which refinement depends,\r\nand degraded the mother who became the simple minister of pleasure to,\r\nand the means of increasing the influence of, the Patriarchal head. This\r\npoint is very vividly shown in the earlier history of the Israelites\r\nwhere the unhappy effects of polygamy are distinctly portrayed. From the\r\nsame source we see how the first institution among men gradually grew\r\ninto the Tribe, and the foundations of Organized Government were laid.\r\n\r\n5. Population rapidly increased, the original progenitor, or the\r\noldest of his male descendants, became the fountain of authority and\r\ninfluence, and was, in many cases, the chief or king, exercising an\r\nundefined control, sometimes absolute and despotic, and again that of a\r\nmerely nominal head, the variations taking every shade between the two.\r\nOccasionally, special gifts, as energy, foresight and skill, favored by\r\ncircumstances, raised one in the tribe to eminence, and he became the\r\nacknowledged ruler to the exclusion of the patriarch, or hereditary heir\r\nof the patriarchal office, as in the case of Joseph in Egypt, and, in\r\nlater times, Moses, Joshua and the Judges.\r\n\r\n6. Again, a pastoral life being abandoned, the people gathered for\r\nvarious reasons in towns, and cities were built up, where the original\r\nstyle of government became impossible, from the mixed character of\r\nthe population; the oldest, or family government, being founded on\r\nrelationship and traditional respect. The need of leadership and the\r\nservice rendered by some member of the community founded a despotic\r\nauthority. In many cases a city was founded by an adventurer who had\r\ngathered supporters around him by some special ability, or by some\r\naccidental pre-eminence, as we see in Nimrod and Romulus; or, as often\r\noccurred, the head of a family or tribe which forsook the pastoral life\r\nand founded a city, from a patriarch or chieftain became a king.\r\n\r\nGovernment, in early times, was very imperfectly organized. It gradually\r\nadvanced with some people to a high point; while with others it continued\r\nin a very undeveloped state for long periods—some races never having\r\nreached any high stage at all, or only temporarily under some talented\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe first settled governments are found in fertile river valleys where\r\nthe cultivation of the soil arrested roving and desultory habits, and\r\noften formed the nucleus of an empire. There is reason to believe that\r\nthe first emigration from the early home of the race was toward the east,\r\nthat a state was soon formed in China which became considerably civilized\r\nand fairly well organized the earliest of all. Their national traditions\r\nand some of their recorded dates claim a vast antiquity. It is not yet\r\ndetermined by scholars how much credit is to be allowed to these claims.\r\n\r\n7. As it appears at present, two other governments were organized at\r\nnearly the same time, one in the lower valley of the Euphrates and the\r\nother on the Nile. It is also possible that a fourth was built up in\r\nIndia nearly cotemporary with these. Certain similarities between the\r\nancient ruins of Egypt and India, and the traditions in the latter\r\ncountry have given rise to the suspicion; but no certainty has yet been\r\nreached. Several systems of chronology, independent of each other,\r\nare found in Egypt, all agreeing as to its enormous antiquity, but\r\ndisagreeing in some important points, and satisfactory tests have not\r\nyet been met with, so that the early days of Egypt are very obscure.\r\nThe evidences of a clearly defined progress are presented in its\r\nmonuments, but the earliest bear so strong a resemblance to the later\r\nthat there is some reason for supposing that the first inhabitants had\r\nreached a considerable degree of maturity before settling there. As yet,\r\nhowever, that point is only an inference—the most probable escape from a\r\ndifficulty. The empires established on the Euphrates, and north of that\r\non the Tigris, mark the steps of progress very distinctly, and furnish\r\nfairly satisfactory means of computing their general chronology.\r\n\r\n8. In all these cases it appears from monuments, traditions, and from\r\nwhatever information the records of the Bible and other histories give\r\nus, that when men began to gather in communities, cultivate the ground\r\nand build cities, their governments were controlled by kings. Despotic\r\nsovereignty was the natural and necessary instrument of government.\r\nThe vigorous will of an admired chief concentrated the energies of the\r\ncommunity, and a state was formed. The beginnings were very rude and\r\nimprovement was slow, never reaching beyond the simple application of\r\nforce as to the structure and modes of government. But another element,\r\nfounded on the religious nature of mankind, which also had entered as\r\nan important influence into family government from the earliest times,\r\nbecame organized in the early days of monarchy, viz.:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INSTITUTION OF A PRIESTHOOD.\r\n\r\n9. It would appear, from such traces of a religious tendency as are found\r\nin the primary languages, that the religious instinct was awakened by an\r\nobservation of the forces of nature, which struck the mind with wonder,\r\nadmiration, or terror. The mysteries of growth, the power of winds and\r\nstorms and waters, the calm beauty, beneficence and brilliance of the\r\nsun, moon and stars riding undisturbed in the heavens, impressed man with\r\na sense of something superior to himself. The moods of nature suggested\r\nsome unknown being with a varying disposition like his own. His wants,\r\nhis hopes and fears, and his sense of helplessness soon led him to seek\r\nto propitiate these unknown powers. The first religion, among all the\r\nprimitive nations, seems to have been a worship of the powers of nature.\r\nThe head of the family was naturally the first priest of the family. This\r\noffice increased the respect in which he was held by his multiplying\r\ndescendants, and contributed to strengthen his authority.\r\n\r\n10. But when, in the organization of cities and states, patriarchal\r\ninfluence decayed, and was replaced by the authority of the chieftain or\r\nthe king, a class of men was set apart to fill the office of religious\r\ninstructors, to discover the art and conduct the acts of general worship.\r\nThe great mystery and uncertainty surrounding the objects of worship,\r\nrequired exclusive study and a supposed purity and elevation of mind\r\nimpossible to others which soon raised the priesthood into an institution\r\nmuch revered. It acquired great influence, and afforded an opening to\r\nambition only inferior to that of the chief or king. The two commonly\r\nunited for mutual support, and thus mankind gained two institutions\r\ndestined to be of incalculable value, as well as of almost boundless\r\ninjury. In the earlier ages they must have been an almost unmixed\r\ngood. They disciplined, the one the labors, the other the minds, of\r\ncommunities. They were the two most powerful instruments for initiating\r\nprogress. They moulded the mass, gave it form, and directed its energies.\r\n\r\nTo a certain degree they each formed a check on the excessive tendencies\r\nof the other. But, the power of each fairly established, they often\r\nunited to set very hurtful limits to spontaneous action. The king used\r\nhis power to the common injury, and the priests their knowledge to the\r\ncommon debasement. The first exhausted the sources of prosperity and\r\ngrowth among his people to gratify his caprices and pleasures, and the\r\npriesthood promoted degrading superstitions and a gross idolatry to\r\nstrengthen their influence. It was for the interest of both to keep the\r\npeople in pupilage, and check all tendencies to independent action or\r\nthought. Had it been possible for them to be wise and high-minded, the\r\nrace would have been saved many centuries of debasement and misery.\r\n\r\n11. These evils were, in some degree, checked by influences which have\r\never since been the mainspring of progress—_War_ and _Commerce_. In early\r\ntimes, relationships of blood or of immediate interest were the chief\r\nbonds among men. All outside the family, tribe, or nation were usually\r\nheld as enemies; and passion, interest, or ambition in the ruler led to\r\nconstant conflict. But the shock of peoples awakened their minds, made\r\nthem acquainted with each other, made their inventions and arts in some\r\ndegree common property, and mingled the thought and blood of different\r\nraces; and this greatly enlarged the ideas and capacities of both\r\nconquerors and conquered. The acquaintance made in this way, with men and\r\ncountries, led to an interchange of products, during quiet times, and\r\ntrade and commerce soon sprung up. This, appealing to the best interests\r\nand instincts of the most enterprising among the people, has always\r\nbeen a powerful instrument of advancement. It led to distant voyages\r\nand travels, to observation and intercourse, with a view to pecuniary\r\nadvantage, to inventions and improvements in industry and art, that kept\r\nthe peoples so related in a state of constant progress.\r\n\r\n12. A growing population required increasing attention to agriculture and\r\nthe mechanic arts, and increasing wealth led to architectural display\r\nand the increase of instruments of luxury, the production of which\r\ndisciplined the skill of the artisan and contributed to the general\r\ngrowth. All these were the elements and foundation of civilization. An\r\norganization commenced, and a state founded, the king soon found leisure\r\nto look about and envy the wealth and territories of his neighbor. He\r\nmade war and commenced a career of conquest, or fell, under defeat,\r\ninto his neighbor’s hand, when time took a step forward, and a new\r\nconsolidation, wider and higher than the former, was laid on a broader\r\nbase. Slowly but surely an advance was made.\r\n\r\n13. We are now to observe this gradual development in the successive\r\nhistory of five monarchies in Asia and the kingdom of Egypt, down to the\r\ntime when they all fell before the conquering power of Greece, under\r\nAlexander the Great, which introduces new and far higher elements of\r\nprogress among the civilized races, and forms the full opening of a new\r\nEra.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nANCIENT MONARCHIES.\r\n\r\n1. The Chaldean Monarchy was the first in order of time. It seems very\r\nlikely that the first settlement which, in the slow development of the\r\nearliest races, finally produced an organized kingdom on the lower part\r\nof the Euphrates, was made somewhere in the neighborhood of 3000 years\r\nbefore the Christian Era. It is, however, a matter of dispute between\r\nthe best authorities whether it can be placed so far back. The monuments\r\nof that age are difficult to decipher, but it seems pretty certain that\r\na Scythian or Turanian government preceded that which the traditions of\r\nancient history, the statements of the Bible, and the indications of\r\nthe ruins unite in placing at 2234 B. C. The founder appears as Nimrod,\r\nor Bilu-Nipur. Many indications render it fairly certain that the early\r\nformative stages of a kingdom had already passed, and that Nimrod merely\r\nchanged the capital. The first people had learned to subdue their soil,\r\nhad begun to build and to bring language and art to some degree of order,\r\nwhen it appears that a Hamitic race, more advanced than they, and showing\r\nstrong likeness to the early Egyptians, mingled with them. In the first\r\ninscriptions the language is Turanian, but the character Hamitic, or\r\nEgyptian. So far as can be judged, the displacement was peaceful and\r\ngradual. About the time above named, a man of great genius, Nimrod, a\r\nHamite, or Cushite, as he is termed in the Mosaic record, a “mighty\r\nhunter,” as his name implies, founded a kingdom farther up the Euphrates,\r\nand on the plain which lay between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris.\r\n\r\n2. The existence of the first empire is dimly made out, and that is\r\nall. Nimrod had clearly a foundation to build on, and he made a great\r\nimpression on his own times. After his death he was deified under the\r\nname of Bel, and became the favorite among the fifteen or sixteen\r\nprincipal deities of the early Chaldeans. These gods and goddesses seem\r\nto represent the heavenly bodies; while the earlier Turanian worship\r\nwas a veneration of the powers of nature. Nimrod’s dynasty appears to\r\nhave covered a period of about two hundred and fifty years, including\r\nthe reigns of eleven kings. They made great advancement in draining the\r\nmarshy valley and regulating the supply of moisture to the growing crops.\r\nThey became expert in the manufacture of cloths and in building with\r\nbricks which are covered with inscriptions. The priesthood acquired a\r\nstrong development at this time, as appears in the ruins and inscriptions\r\nof their temples. The kings do not appear to have been very warlike, or\r\nto have extended their dominion far.\r\n\r\n3. A second Chaldean kingdom was founded about 1976 B. C. It is called\r\nElam in the Bible, and furnishes the first known example of what was\r\nafterward so often seen in that region—an extensive kingdom formed by\r\na series of rapid conquests, that fell to pieces again as soon as a\r\nvigorous hand failed to uphold it. The kingdom continued till about B. C.\r\n1500. Kudur-Lagamer, the Chedor-Laomer of the Mosaic account, overran a\r\nterritory one thousand miles in length by five hundred in width. In one\r\nof his incursions into Palestine his forces were defeated by Abraham,\r\nwhich ended a control over that region lasting twelve years. There is no\r\nindication that the following sovereigns exerted authority beyond Chaldea\r\nand Babylonia.\r\n\r\nThere, however, they grew rich and civilized, extending their commerce\r\nto India and Egypt, becoming famous and envied for their splendor and\r\nluxury. A single small dwelling house of that period has been preserved\r\nin the ruins of Chedor-Laomer’s capital “Ur of the Chaldees,” south of\r\nBabylon. It was built on a platform of dried bricks, the walls of great\r\nthickness, with two arched doors, and, apparently, lighted from the\r\nroof. The rooms were long and narrow. Iron was at that time unknown. All\r\nimplements were of stone or bronze. Religion seemed to increase in its\r\ngrossness, apparently under the policy of the priesthood, who laid the\r\nfoundation of astronomical science and began to acquire the reputation\r\nfor hidden knowledge for which they became famous in after centuries.\r\nNothing of any importance is related of the kings of this monarchy except\r\nthe one conqueror. Despotism and priestly craft kept most of the feeble\r\ntendencies to political improvement curbed—waiting for better times. That\r\narrived with the advent of the _Assyrian Empire_, about B. C. 1500.\r\n\r\n4. It appears that for a long time before, a family, or tribe,\r\nof Shemites had been settled in Chaldea, where they acquired its\r\ncivilization and arts, and some time about B. C. 1600 emigrated north,\r\nsettling on the river Tigris. They were a strong race, physically and\r\nmentally, quite too fierce and resolute to be held in leading-strings by\r\nthe Chaldean priesthood. The country they occupied was higher and more\r\nvaried, abundantly supplied with stone, which was wanting in Babylonia\r\nand Chaldea.\r\n\r\nHere, in process of time, the most vigorous and progressive race that\r\nhad yet been seen among the families of man, built up a succession of\r\ncities within a small circuit, each of which was, at different times, the\r\ncapital, and which were all finally united and made the famous Nineveh\r\nof the Greek historians, and the immense “city of three days’ journey,”\r\nvisited by the Jewish prophet, Jonah. Within a few years these ruins have\r\nbeen examined by competent men of science with great care, and have been\r\nfound to confirm the Bible narrative, in all essential points, and most\r\nof the glowing descriptions of profane historians; while their higher\r\nstyle of art and greater vigor and pride of achievement led them to build\r\nmonuments and engrave records that promise to make us very intimately\r\nacquainted with their social, political and moral life.\r\n\r\n5. They seem to have acquired the habit in Chaldea of raising a vast\r\nelevated mound for their more important buildings. The largest mound is\r\nfound to be nearly one hundred feet high, and to cover an area of one\r\nhundred acres, and on the summit of this were placed their temples and\r\nthe palaces of their kings. This immense foundation, it is said, would\r\nrequire the labor of twenty thousand men for six years. After this were\r\nto be constructed their vast buildings, covered with sculptures and\r\nadorned with statues. Another mound, higher but embracing a smaller\r\narea—about forty acres—served the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThey were extremely religious in their way, but the vigor of the kings\r\nappears to have overshadowed the priesthood much more than in Chaldea. It\r\nseems to have been about three hundred years after the establishment of\r\nthis enterprising stock in Assyria that they became famous for foreign\r\nconquest. Babylon had been gradually rising in importance, often in\r\nsubjection, more or less nominal, to the growing northern power, but\r\nretaining its own kings and habits.\r\n\r\n6. The reign of Shalmaneser I., about 1290 B. C., was distinguished by\r\nhis building a new city and improving his kingdom; and his successor,\r\nin 1270, signalized his reign by establishing, for a time, a complete\r\nsovereignty over Babylon, and the historical Assyrian empire is commonly\r\ndated from that event. For a century and a half there are few important\r\nrecords. Tiglath-Pileser I., in B. C. 1130, commenced a series of\r\nefforts to extend his dominions by conquest, which his success led\r\nhim to describe with unusual detail. It embraces five campaigns and a\r\ndescription of the conquest of all the neighboring people. He established\r\na compact and powerful empire, which was surrounded by wild tribes whose\r\nconquest was of little honor or value, and whom it was difficult to\r\nhold long in subjection. In a return from a campaign against Babylon,\r\nwhich he had conquered, he suffered a great reverse, losing the images\r\nof his gods which he kept in his camp for protection and assistance in\r\nhis enterprises; and they were carried to Babylon, remaining there, it\r\nis said, 400 years. A long period of apparent quiet was followed, after\r\nmore than two hundred years, by another warlike king who pushed his\r\nconquests to the Mediterranean sea. His public works were larger and more\r\nmagnificent than those of any of his predecessors. He has recorded ten\r\nsuccessful campaigns.\r\n\r\n7. His son, Shalmaneser II., increased the number, extent and\r\nthoroughness of the conquests of his father. Still, most of the countries\r\nconquered retained their laws and government, simply paying an annual\r\ntribute, and the conquest set lightly on them. Babylon seems to have\r\nretained comparative independence. In the following reign, Babylon was\r\ncaptured and remained some time tributary to Assyria and the Ninus, or\r\nIva-lush IV., whose wife was the celebrated Semiramis, still further\r\nextended Assyrian power. The wonderful tales related by Grecian\r\nhistorians of Semiramis are not confirmed by the monuments. She appears\r\nto have been an energetic Babylonian princess, the principal queen of\r\nNinus, who ruled conjointly with him. The novelty of a female ruler in\r\nthat rude age, and the splendor of the empire at the time, seem to have\r\noriginated the fabulous tales related of her.\r\n\r\n8. At this time the development of the people of all the western parts\r\nof Asia was so great, and the wars as well as peaceful intercourse of\r\ndifferent nations had so stimulated them all, that improvement kept a\r\ntolerably even step. Multitudes of populous cities and kingdoms existed\r\nin all directions. The magnificence of Solomon belongs to this period,\r\nthe Jewish monarchy having reached the height of its glory and power,\r\ntoo high to be long endured by the proud and enterprising Assyrians.\r\nCommerce filled the east with activity and manufactures flourished, in\r\nsome directions reaching a high degree of excellence. A true progress\r\nmarked the general course of human effort. The psalms of David show to\r\nwhat a lofty point the religious ideas of that age were capable of being\r\ncarried. Industrial pursuits and agriculture reached, in the next hundred\r\nand fifty years, the highest development they ever attained in some\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n9. In the midst of this busy industry Nineveh rose, peerless in grandeur,\r\nenriching herself with the tribute and spoils of all countries,\r\nbeautified by the master race, which was wise enough not to dry up the\r\nsources of their prosperity by the destruction of cities and kingdoms.\r\nThe common policy, up to nearly the close of her splendid career, was\r\nto leave the real resources of all conquered nations untouched. After\r\ndefeating her opposer in a battle, she received the submission of the\r\nking, imposed a heavy tax, or forced contribution, and an engagement to\r\npay a definite annual tribute, and went on her way to subdue another\r\nnation to a like formal control. With misfortune, or a change of rulers\r\nin the dominant kingdom, the subject-kings would withhold tribute, raise\r\nan army, and the whole work of conquest had to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThus the empire consisted of a stable nucleus, Assyria, and a vast\r\nfloating mass of half independent kingdoms, states and cities which\r\nwere now submissive and now in revolt. We may easily conceive how this\r\ncomparatively mild mode of warfare would contribute to the general\r\nadvance of the whole population. This mingling and clash of armies,\r\nsurging to and fro of vast bodies of men, and the knowledge and culture\r\nreceived from the great and wealthy capital made the school of that\r\nperiod for the education of humanity.\r\n\r\n10. The Assyrian annals show a continued growth in splendor and power and\r\nextent of dominion until the very eve of its fall. In the course of that\r\ntime Egypt was invaded and partially subdued for the first time; and, in\r\nthe impatience of frequent revolt, the practice commenced of removing\r\nwhole nations from their original homes, supplying their place by others.\r\nThus the Ten Tribes were transported from their homes in Samaria, and\r\nother nations brought to occupy their places.\r\n\r\nThe last king of Assyria inherited an authority that extended farther\r\nand over larger numbers than had ever before been known. The vigorous\r\ngoverning race were perhaps corrupted and weakened by a thousand years\r\nof power and success; but various extraordinary circumstances united to\r\nbring on a sudden catastrophe. A considerable part of the central kingdom\r\nwas devastated by an irresistible host of Scythians, immediately after\r\nwhich the Medians, who were as fierce and warlike as the Assyrians in\r\ntheir best days, attacked Assyria. A large army, sent by the king to meet\r\nthe invaders, went over to the enemy by the treachery of its general,\r\nNabopolassar, and the combined armies laid siege to Nineveh, which\r\nfell, the king burning himself and his family in his palace. Nineveh\r\nwas destroyed, and Nabopolassar received as his reward the kingdom of\r\nBabylonia, and the Assyrian conquests in the south and west. He founded\r\nthe\r\n\r\n11. Babylonian Empire, which has made a greater impression on posterity\r\nthan Nineveh. He was a man of great energy and resources. The treasures\r\nand captives of that mighty city, that fell to his share, were employed\r\nin rebuilding and improving Babylon. During his reign of twenty-one\r\nyears, and the forty-three years of his still more illustrious son and\r\nsuccessor, Nebuchadnezzar, that city was made the wonder of the world.\r\nEach side of it was fifteen miles in length, the river Euphrates passing\r\nthrough its center. They repaired the wall, which was eighty-seven feet\r\nthick and more than three hundred feet high. This wall was so immense\r\nas to contain more than twice the cubic contents of the great wall of\r\nChina, which is 1,400 miles in length, and the vast enclosed space was\r\nfilled with palaces, temples, hanging gardens, and all the impressive\r\nevidences of boundless power and resources in which the gross ambition\r\nof that period delighted. A second wall was built within the first, the\r\nriver was, for a time, turned out of its bed and its bottom and sides\r\npaved with masonry, and huge walls erected on either bank; canals and\r\naqueducts, for agricultural purposes, of the most stupendous character,\r\nwere constructed all over the broad valley. The wealth and energies of\r\nthe richest and most populous part of Asia, as then known, were employed\r\nto build up the great capital and improve the central province.\r\n\r\n12. The Jews were kept there, as captives, for seventy years, all the\r\ntreasures of their city and temple, and the accumulated wealth of their\r\nnation, were poured into the Babylonian treasury, and their people\r\nemployed, with other countless multitudes, in the construction of its\r\nwalls and buildings, and the cultivation of its fields. Tyre, the most\r\nrenowned commercial city of ancient times, was taken, after a siege of\r\nthirteen years, and much of Egypt was reduced.\r\n\r\nIt was the culmination of the centralizing system of the Assyrians and\r\nChaldeans which had lasted for two thousand years.\r\n\r\n13. A dominion so resting on physical force, and gorged with booty\r\nwrested from others, with no moral power or national spirit underlying\r\nit, could not last long. A more vigorous and warlike power rose by the\r\nunion of the Persians and Medes under the Persian warrior, Cyrus, who,\r\nafter a series of conquests farther north and west, in Asia Minor, turned\r\nhis arms against Babylon. The walls were impregnable, but the river\r\nproved a source of weakness. It had been once diverted from its course\r\nto pave its bed within the city; the hint was accepted, and, on a night\r\nof feasting and carelessness, it was again turned aside to give free\r\nentrance to the besiegers, and the Babylonian Empire fell in the very\r\nheight of its pomp and glory. We find a regular progress in organization,\r\nin most institutions, from the first Chaldean to the last Babylonian\r\nEmpire. In popular religion alone was there an increasing grossness,\r\nwhich reached its limit about this time by the fall of the Chaldean\r\npriesthood, purer practices and ideas were circulated by the Jews in\r\ntheir captivity, and the Magian religion was reformed by Zoroaster.\r\n\r\n14. The Medo-Persian Empire lasted for 200 years. Those nationalities\r\nwere both of the Aryan or Indo-European race. They had long been\r\nmaturing on the highlands bordering the north and east of Chaldea and\r\nAssyria, with which their connection was close enough to communicate the\r\ngeneral value of the growing organization, but too slight to drag them\r\ndown to its level. They brought now, to the common stock of progress,\r\nthe freshness of youth and the healthy habits and pure blood of the\r\nmountaineer. They had a higher capacity for organization, by which the\r\nexperience and progress of the older nations, for more than two thousand\r\nyears, was prepared to profit. They had already subdued Asia Minor\r\nand their vast Empire soon extended from India to the sea that washed\r\nthe shores of Greece. A complicated civil and military organization\r\nconsolidated this extensive region more perfectly than before by armies\r\nand governors located in each nation and principal city; a system of easy\r\ncommunication was introduced; and the preparation for the higher Greek\r\nmodels of thought, and the severe regularity of Roman institutions went\r\non apace.\r\n\r\n15. Babylon fell gradually into decay, being only occasionally the\r\ncapital of the Persian Empire; the love of the sovereigns of that race\r\nfor their native highlands leading them to build splendid capitals in the\r\nborders of their own country. A reform of great significance occurred\r\nabout this time in the Persian national religion, which gradually\r\ndisplaced the debasing superstitions and gross idolatry of all the\r\nnations of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe government was still despotic, somewhat relieved by the more humane\r\nand independent habits and traditions of a hardier race. A number of\r\nchanges of dynasty by violence occurred, but they were merely revolutions\r\nof the palace. The vast wealth and power inherited from the subject\r\nempires gradually corrupted the conquerors. Their armies became vast\r\ncrowds of comparatively undisciplined troops, who were accustomed to bear\r\neverything before them by their irresistible weight. Their conquests on\r\nthe northern and eastern coasts of Asia Minor brought them in conflict\r\nwith the Greeks, who had many colonies long settled in that region, and\r\nthe Persians soon undertook to subdue that intelligent and independent\r\npeople. Their signal failure had the effect to greatly stimulate the\r\ndevelopment of the Greek national spirit, and to awaken its intellectual\r\nenthusiasm, and the mighty armies of the Persians were destined to be\r\nannihilated by the small but resolute forces of the little republics.\r\n\r\n16. Thirteen sovereigns ruled during the continuance of the Persian\r\nempire. Except the conquest of Egypt, they did not very greatly extend\r\nthe boundaries formed by Cyrus; but the national features of the subject\r\npeoples were gradually effaced, and the whole brought to the common level\r\nof civilization. When Alexander, the great Grecian soldier, appeared\r\nwith his army of 35,000 men he scattered the hosts of the Persian king,\r\nDarius, as the wind drives the leaves of the forest; and the vast empire,\r\nso long accustomed to bow to the fate of battles, became the unresisting\r\nheritage of the conquerer.\r\n\r\nThese five great monarchies were continuous—in part on the same soil—the\r\ncentre having always been the fertile valleys of the Euphrates and the\r\nTigris; the successor stepping into the place and carrying out the\r\ngeneral plans of his immediate predecessor, but on a broader scale and\r\nin an increasingly enlightened manner. Through all these long centuries\r\na mysterious, and, apparently, still more ancient race had occupied\r\nEgypt, only occasionally interfering with, or being disturbed by, the\r\nsurging sea of strife that raged and foamed so near them, which at length\r\nforced them from their seclusion and bore them on in the general tide of\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n17. The Egyptian monarchy presents many very curious and difficult\r\nproblems. Possessing the most perfect organization in the earliest times\r\nof which we have any knowledge, the traces of its beginnings quite fail\r\nus, although, more than any other nation, it loved to build great and\r\nimpressive monuments and record on them, in the most minute manner, the\r\nsingular habits and monotonous daily life of its people. The first of\r\nthose monuments, which, by many signs, must date very nearly as far back\r\nin the remote past as the earliest dawn of organization among any other\r\npeople of whom we can gather any certain traces, indicate a long settled\r\nstate, a high degree of organization, considerable culture and great\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n18. The first king, who is called Menes by several independent and very\r\nancient authorities, made his reign memorable by a system of vast and\r\nuseful public works. It is conjectured that the previous rulers were the\r\nsacerdotal class and that, up to that time, they had no kings. The habits\r\nof the people were quiet and peaceful, and they seem to have been first\r\ngathered around temples. In all stages of their history, down to the time\r\nwhen foreign intrusion by force disorganized their peculiar institutions,\r\nthe priesthood was the most influential element in their constitution,\r\nand their sway seems to have been, in some respects, singularly mild and\r\nbeneficent. Except for the extreme inflexibility and minuteness of their\r\nregulations, which repressed all spontaneous growth, and the gross and\r\nabsurd worship of animals which they introduced, they might be considered\r\nan unmixed blessing to those early times. It is certain that they were\r\nsuccessful in controlling men and moulding them to their own views\r\nwithout producing discontent or revolt.\r\n\r\n19. Everything in Egypt was remarkable—its river, its country, and the\r\ninstitutions and habits of its people. The Egyptians dwelt in the valley\r\nof the Nile for a space of 500 miles above its mouth; but this valley was\r\nso narrow that the habitable part of it contained only about 6,000 square\r\nmiles in all. It was shut in by the Red sea on the east and by trackless\r\ndeserts on the west, and a fall of rain was so rare as to be considered\r\na prodigy. In June each year their mysterious river, whose sources are\r\nyet almost unknown, began to rise till it covered the whole valley like\r\na vast sea. The rise and fall occupied the summer months and to the\r\nmiddle of October. The waters left a rich coating of mud and slime,\r\nwhich rendered the valley fertile beyond measure. The productive season\r\noccupied the remainder of the year, and their agricultural resources were\r\nonly limited by their skill in spreading and husbanding the fertilizing\r\nwaters. Vast canals and reservoirs covered the whole valley. Lake Moeris,\r\na reservoir partly natural and partly artificial, was said by the first\r\nGreek historian, Herodotus, to have been 400 miles in circuit. When the\r\nwaters had reached their highest point, the cisterns, canals and lakes\r\nwere filled and the waters kept in reserve for late periods of the year,\r\nand a succession of crops.\r\n\r\n20. The mysterious character of the river seems to have deeply impressed\r\nthe nation with awe and reverence for unseen powers, and contributed to\r\nthe influence of the priestly caste. Their peculiar source of wealth\r\nand the amount of leisure periodically afforded, perhaps led to the\r\nconstruction of the temples and palaces, whose gloomy strength is as\r\nmysterious as their river, or the origin of the people. Far back in the\r\ntwilight of time, Thebes, the “city of a hundred gates,” was a colossal\r\ncapital. Its vast temples and palaces were built on a scale of grandeur\r\nthat seems almost superhuman; yet, before history begins its narrative in\r\nGreece, Thebes had had its youth, its long period of splendor and glory,\r\nits hoary age, and was already a thing of the past, and nearly in ruins;\r\nnot by violence or conquest, but by the natural transfer of the center of\r\nactivities to another region. Considering the small extent of Egypt, its\r\nalways overflowing population, and the tenacious habits of the Egyptians,\r\nnothing could more impressively show its great age.\r\n\r\n21. Egyptian sculpture was descriptive of religious ceremonies on the\r\ntemples, and on the palaces of domestic life and general habits, and\r\nfurnishes us with details of the whole social structure and all their\r\nindustrial pursuits, as well as the events in the campaigns of their few\r\nwarlike monarchs. Add to these the minute delineation of their temple\r\nservice and religious teachings, and its ruins describe the entire round\r\nof its ancient life.\r\n\r\nThe people were divided into classes, or castes, the son being obliged\r\nto follow the occupation of the father; and all branches of business\r\nand industry, public and private, were arranged in the most methodical\r\nmanner. The priest, the soldier, the husbandman, the artisan of whatever\r\nbranch, was so because his ancestors had been such for numberless\r\ngenerations. A king could be selected either from the priestly or the\r\nsoldier caste; but he must previously have been initiated into all the\r\nmysteries of the priesthood, and therefore Moses, the acknowledged\r\nheir of the throne, “was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.”\r\nOtherwise, not belonging to the priestly caste, he must have remained\r\nin ignorance. With this exception, the priest alone had the key of\r\nknowledge, and all the employments requiring intellectual studies,\r\nor scientific culture, as we should now say, were filled from that\r\nclass. They kept all records, measurements, and apportionments of land;\r\nprescribed the times, seasons, and conduct of all public transactions;\r\nwere the constitutional advisers of the king; they were physicians,\r\nastronomers, philosophers, and guides of the people in every respect.\r\nThey alone did the thinking, and they guarded their prerogative with the\r\nmost jealous care.\r\n\r\n22. A people are debased and gross in proportion to their ignorance,\r\nand the ignorant masses of Egypt were amused with the greatest possible\r\nmultiplication of gods, and their leisure and simple minds fully occupied\r\nin religious ceremonies and absurd fictions. But the priests were as wise\r\nand moderate as they were crafty and persistent. Their discipline was\r\nextremely judicious and well administered, and was laid on the king as\r\nwell and sternly, as to his general life, as on the lowest peasant. The\r\npriesthood were as absolute, as impartial, and as unvarying from age to\r\nage as it is possible to conceive. Their services to humanity were very\r\ngreat. They laid the foundation among men, of unvarying law, of diligence\r\nin the employment of time, of exactness in the division of labor, and\r\ninculcated, in an effective way, the idea of divine justice and of\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\n23. Their “wisdom” was the highest and the most fruitful that was,\r\nperhaps, possible in their times; their fame was wide-spread, and their\r\ninfluence on the legislation of other lands has laid all ages under\r\ngreat obligations. The political economy of the Jews was the product of\r\none of their most intelligent disciples, and the fact that he was so\r\nprobably added greatly to his influence and success with his own people;\r\nand all the great legislators, philosophers, and historians of Greece\r\nwent to them to complete their education. In after times, when the nation\r\nlost its liberty and became the province of a distant kingdom, they sunk\r\nthe priest in the scholar, and Egypt had the largest libraries and the\r\nmost eminent philosophers in the world. After Greece was carried, as it\r\nwere, bodily, to Rome, far down into the Christian Era, Alexandria was\r\nthe university of the world.\r\n\r\nThe history of Egypt is thus entirely peculiar, being mainly that of its\r\nown influential class. They impressed a peaceful, generally virtuous,\r\nlaborious, as well as monotonous character on its history, and, besides\r\nthe vast monuments which the patient industry they inspired reared up,\r\nand the names of their interminable list of kings, there was, perhaps,\r\nlittle to record.\r\n\r\n24. The entire number of their dynasties of kings, as they have handed\r\nthem down to us, is thirty-two, the last being the Ptolemies, founded by\r\na Greek general of that name, after the death of Alexander the Great,\r\nwhich lasted more than three hundred years, closing B. C. 44. The first\r\ntwelve dynasties are called the Old Empire, whose period it is impossible\r\nto determine accurately. The five following dynasties are ascribed to the\r\nreign of foreigners, called “shepherd kings,” who are supposed to have\r\nestablished their authority between the times of Joseph and Moses, and\r\nare called the Middle Empire; while thirteen dynasties, including the\r\nroyal families that reigned down to the time of the conquest of Egypt by\r\nthe Persians, comprise the New Empire. They were generally exclusive,\r\nshut up within themselves, too much absorbed in exact observance of\r\nthe endless routine prescribed by their priests to be inclined to the\r\nambition of foreign conquest; but several of their kings gathered large\r\narmies and invaded Palestine and Syria, or made a trial of strength with\r\nthe Assyrians or Babylonians. They never made permanent conquests in that\r\ndirection. Some of the later kings became friendly to the Greeks, and\r\nemployed them in their armies, to the great disgust of their subjects,\r\nthe soldier caste retiring, almost in a body, to Ethiopia, and refusing\r\nto return. The kingdom soon after fell into the hands of foreigners, and\r\nthe accumulated discipline, knowledge and wealth of that wise people\r\nbecame the inheritance of humanity.\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar was the first who made a conquest of Egypt, but the\r\ncountry soon regained its independence. It was not till after the death\r\nof Cyrus, and when the details of the new Medo-Persian kingdom had been\r\nsettled, that Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, subdued the whole of Egypt, and\r\nmade it a Persian province, in which condition it remained most of the\r\ntime to the Grecian invasion.\r\n\r\n25. About twenty-five hundred years before the time of Alexander the\r\nGreat, the cities of Sidon and Tyre were founded, in Phenicia, on the\r\neastern shore of the Mediterranean sea. Their territory extended only\r\ntwenty miles back, from the sea. They were of the Semite race, and their\r\nenterprising spirit led them to build ships and become at first pirates\r\nand then merchants. They were thrifty and grew rich, improved their\r\nvessels and became famous for their commerce. They at length planted\r\ncolonies for trading purposes on the northern coasts of Africa, in Sicily\r\nand in Spain.\r\n\r\nOne of those colonies, Carthage, became more wealthy and powerful than\r\nthe parent state. The merchandise they gathered from distant countries\r\nthey distributed through Asia by a land trade, and their caravans reached\r\nNineveh, Babylon and Persia, and, for long periods, were almost the\r\nonly link that joined Egypt to the rest of the busy and growing world.\r\nThey learned many useful things among the Egyptians, among others the\r\ninvention of letters, or at least hints on which they improved. Many\r\nflourishing cities were built up by this internal commerce in places\r\nsurrounded by desert regions, as Baalbek and Palmyra in Syria, and\r\nPetra in Arabia, a city excavated in the rocks, which, lying between\r\nSyria and Phenicia in the north and the rich districts of Arabia in the\r\nsouth, and between Babylon and Persia on the east and Egypt on the west,\r\nbecame a great mercantile depot. The Phenicians were the busiest and most\r\nenterprising people of ancient times. Their vessels reached the shores\r\nof England, where they had valuable mines of tin, as of silver in Spain;\r\nthey visited the northwest coasts of Africa and the Madeira islands, and\r\nbrought the rich products of India and gold from eastern Africa to the\r\nmarkets of the world. The amount of their contributions to civilization\r\nand progress by making known the discoveries and arts of distant nations\r\nto each other, by causing roads and inns to be built, and facilitating\r\ncommunication, was immense; as well as by awakening the love of gain\r\nand turning the activities of a part of mankind from warlike to more\r\npeaceful and useful pursuits. The arts and inventions that have done the\r\nmost, in the long run, for the improvement of men, as shipbuilding and\r\nwriting, were communicated from one nation to another. Their commercial\r\nroutes were the highways over which the intelligent and inquiring Greeks\r\ntraveled in search of the knowledge which they used for the education of\r\ntheir people. Tyre was destroyed by Alexander B. C. 332; but he replaced\r\nit the same year by building Alexandria, at the mouth of the Nile.\r\n\r\n26. We have thus seen nations and institutions gradually unfolding,\r\npassing through a period of youth, of vigorous organic action, and\r\nfinally decaying, to give place to another of higher order which\r\ninherited all its general gain and proceeded to carry still further the\r\nbanner of civilization. As this process continues the field widens, and\r\nwith the increasing number and variety of the elements engaged in acting\r\nupon one another, the product becomes more valuable, the organization\r\nmore complete and the institutions more useful.\r\n\r\nThe institutions purely political, however, the modes of government and\r\nthe style of administering them, are imperfect, at best. They are too\r\narbitrary, too restrictive; the masses are too large and too closely\r\ncrowded to permit free play to the component parts. The mingling of the\r\nwhole was, at first, evidently necessary to prevent the crystalizing of\r\nthe separate nationalities and the arrest of progress; but when that\r\nprocess was stopped and a plastic condition and progressive tendency\r\nassured, the absolute despotism of the king and the priest stood in the\r\nway of advance. They had educated society and developed its resources\r\nuntil a power of vast combination had been gained; then a change must\r\nbe introduced, or the entire resources of the civilized world would be\r\nemployed to repress its further advancement, the fountains of wealth\r\nwould be exhausted and the springs of activity dried up. This barrier\r\nagainst a destructive centralization had long been preparing among the\r\nGrecian states.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nTHE GRECIAN STATES.\r\n\r\n1. They were of the Aryan race, and showed a high capacity to receive\r\nthe lessons taught by the experience and genius of all the past,\r\nand make them the stepping-stone to a higher civilization and freer\r\ninstitutions. They were preceded in the occupation of Greece by the\r\nPelasgi, of the same stock, but too rude and uncultured to leave many\r\ntraces of their presence except the ruins of immense cyclopean buildings,\r\nwithout inscriptions, indicating only a dawning culture, but a vigorous\r\ncombination of physical force. The mythic history of Greece is in part a\r\nveiled and distorted account of the struggles of Hellens, or true Greeks,\r\nagainst those uncouth aborigines; the actual facts being mingled by\r\nthe lively creative fancy of their poets with the religious traditions\r\nbrought from their original home. The highly picturesque language of\r\nthe primitive Aryan people accorded with the imaginative and observant\r\ncharacter of that family, and its inclination to extemporize some\r\nplausible explanation of the natural phenomena which awakened their\r\nattention, and, apparently, suggested the general course of invention\r\nand embellishment adopted by the poets, who were the historians, the\r\ntheologians, and the only literary class of their period. Thus the early\r\nspeculations and crude religious ideas assumed, in poetic hands, an\r\nexceedingly fanciful and marvelous garb; and their heroes, who succeeded\r\nin overcoming the difficulties of a new settlement, and in laying the\r\nfoundation of their communities in a rude country filled with men and\r\nbeasts almost equally wild and savage, were endowed by their grateful and\r\nadmiring descendants with superhuman qualities, and wonder and reverence\r\nascribed to them a descent from the gods.\r\n\r\n2. A characteristic feature of Grecian heroic mythology is the number\r\nand mutual contests of these mythical heroes which indicate a leading\r\ncharacteristic of the nation—a disposition toward independence and\r\ndecentralization. Every small community had its divine hero, and insisted\r\non maintaining its government in its own hands. In the early times the\r\nimmediate descendants of these local benefactors commonly obtained the\r\nsovereignty, more or less qualified, over their city and community.\r\nThey all greatly respected the tie that bound them together in kinship\r\nas one race; but they never would permit it to deprive them of local\r\nindependence. If they had a king he should be of their own tribe and\r\nchoice; if they were ruled with harshness it should be only because\r\nthey chose to submit to their own tyrant. They seldom permitted another\r\ncommunity to manage their internal affairs. Various leagues were early\r\nformed among contiguous cities or states closely related by origin; but\r\nthey dealt only in matters of common interest, and if one city or king\r\nwas acknowledged as the head, it was only in a general sense for the sake\r\nof realizing some general plan.\r\n\r\n3. This instinctive and resolute refusal to accept a centralized\r\ngovernment was a new and important feature in the history of men in a\r\ncivilized, or highly organized state. It was the direct opposite of that\r\nwhich characterized Asiatic and African civilization, and held the Greek\r\nrace open to a spontaneous growth and a mental development which made\r\nthem the benefactors of the human family. With less individuality and\r\nmental force, or a less favorable time and situation, it would have kept\r\nthem forever barbarous; but time had matured them and the nations about\r\nthem, and their restless spirit of inquiry and constant movement among\r\nthemselves stood in the place of the foreign action and shock of races\r\nthat proved so beneficial and necessary to the Asiatics. The Egyptian,\r\nChinese and Hindoo peoples reached a certain point of well regulated\r\norder, apparently by an original impulse, and stopped; the Chaldean,\r\nAssyrian and Persian races kept in the stream of progress by a sort of\r\nmechanical or forcible stir and intermingling of races and civilizations;\r\nand the principle accomplished, in each case, all it was capable of. Time\r\nand progress then transferred the care of the best interests of mankind\r\nto _intelligence_ as embodied in the Greek race. Without being conscious\r\nof such a high destiny, they fulfilled it with fidelity, and remained\r\ntrue to themselves and faithful to the impulses of their own minds\r\nuntil humanity required training of a different kind, and another race,\r\nreceiving their mental culture, added to it administrative ability and\r\ncarried the old world as high as it could possibly go on its ancient base.\r\n\r\n4. It seems probable that about B. C. 2000, or in the time of Abraham,\r\nthe progenitors of the Greeks reached that country from the highlands\r\neast of the Caspian Sea. Greece extends about 220 miles from north to\r\nsouth, and 160 from east to west, with a very irregular outline, and\r\ncontains about 34,000 square miles, much of this being mountainous and\r\nbarren. The separation of the different states by these mountain ranges\r\nmuch favored the disposition of the people to local independence, and\r\nformed a bold and hardy race. Access from three sides to the sea led to\r\ncommerce and colonization, while it brought them into frequent contact\r\nwith the most civilized people of the east without endangering their\r\nindependence, and the lofty mountains on the north were an effectual\r\nbarrier to the irruption of the wild and wandering tribes of northern\r\nAsia and Europe. Early in the history of the Greeks colonies came from\r\nEgypt and Phenicia and introduced the arts of those countries, then the\r\nmost civilized in the world. This was about the time that the Jewish\r\nnation was founded by Moses, and we can easily understand that the native\r\nintelligence of the Greeks and their teachable spirit, led them to profit\r\ngreatly by this early light.\r\n\r\n5. The most celebrated traditions of this people relate to an expedition\r\nby the collective young chivalry of Greece, called the “Argonautic,”\r\nwhich indicates their enterprising spirit and early acquaintance with the\r\nsea, and also seems to have introduced the habit of planting colonies.\r\nTwo wars against Thebes, in the central part of Greece, induced by the\r\nambition and combinations of the kings of the various States, seem to\r\nhave made much impression on the whole nation, while a combination of\r\nnearly all of its petty sovereigns, gathering an immense army, stated\r\nat 100,000 men, to punish an injury done to one of their number by the\r\nKing of Troy, on the opposite coast of Asia, occupied ten years, and\r\nfilled the whole country with confusion. This was soon followed by an\r\nevent called the Return of the Heracleidæ, or descendants of Hercules—a\r\nmythic hero of great celebrity—to their ancient dominion in the southern\r\npeninsula, called the Pelopenesus. It appears to have been attended\r\nby the migration of one tribe into the domains of another, which they\r\nforcibly dispossessed and produced the emigration of the conquered\r\npeople into Asia, where they formed extensive colonies—independent—but\r\npreserving a love for their race, and forming an important element in\r\nGreek progress.\r\n\r\n6. The commotions and miseries of this period and of subsequent times,\r\nwhich had their rise mainly in this, most of which were due to the\r\nrestless ambition and personal quarrels of their kings, came at\r\nlength to disgust the spirited and progressive people with that form\r\nof government, and before the time that authentic history begins they\r\nhad very generally set aside the kings and established a democracy; and\r\nwhere this was not the case, as in Sparta, the power of the kings became\r\nso limited that they were little more than leading magistrates in their\r\nrespective cities. This was not often done by violent revolution, but\r\ngenerally in a quiet way, showing the steady and intelligent resolution\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThis rare nation knew how to adapt its governments to its needs. Not\r\nthat everything went on without struggle or difficulty, nor that they\r\ndid not share in the rude and sanguinary passions of their times. Their\r\ngovernments were often unsettled; there were frequent conflicts among\r\naspirants for place and power in the state; they had a balance of power\r\namong the leading states to maintain; and the want of a strong central\r\nauthority led to innumerable collisions and sometimes to desolating wars.\r\nBut amidst all the confusion and imperfection of an early civilization\r\nthey still maintained such an independence of any superior in each state\r\nthat they could settle their internal affairs to suit themselves. They\r\nwere yet uneducated men, in the enthusiastic young manhood of the world,\r\nbut with spirit enough to be free.\r\n\r\n7. That freedom had many defects. The true character of freedom was\r\nimperfectly apprehended in that age of the world. It was often violent;\r\nand much Grecian blood was shed by Greeks. It was frequently turbulent;\r\nand sometimes the strife of parties and factions did great injury to\r\nthe welfare of the state. It was usually a restricted liberty in which\r\nall the inhabitants did not share, for the slave, the freedman, and the\r\nforeigner were admitted to no influence in the government, or in framing\r\nthe laws; and there was always much oppression and injustice somewhere.\r\nIt was not a well understood and well balanced liberty, as we comprehend\r\nit, but it left room for a large amount of free and spontaneous action.\r\nIt made little account of the _individual_; that point was to be learned\r\nand made duly prominent after the lapse of more than two thousand years.\r\nThe Greek identified himself with his state. He would not have it large\r\nin order that each free citizen might have a personal influence in it.\r\nHis public life was an education to him; and the very defects of his\r\ninstitutions fitted them more perfectly to meet the wants of that age\r\nthan anything more complete could have done.\r\n\r\n8. They developed rapidly under a system so free from restraint, coupled\r\nwith a nature so ardent, and a thirst for knowledge so absorbing. Still\r\nit was at least two hundred years after they had re-arranged their\r\nprimitive modes of government before they reached a degree of order\r\nand system that influenced them to record events as they passed, and\r\nobserve the world outside of their state, and even then their most\r\nlearned men wrote little. Men were absorbed in their private matters,\r\nor in the affairs of the state. They thought little of the future; they\r\nwere devoting themselves diligently to the only means of education that\r\nexisted in those days, intercourse and action. Their priesthood was\r\nquite different from what we found it in Chaldea and Egypt. They did not\r\nform a class, nor attempt to exercise an influence on government. They\r\nwere appointed from the body of the citizens to offer sacrifices and\r\nconduct religious ceremonies. The high spirited and active minded Greeks\r\nwere not fit subjects for the dominion of a priestly caste. Although\r\nCecrops, an Egyptian, settled and civilized Athens, and introduced\r\nsome of the social arrangements of his country, he did not plant the\r\nall-controlling priesthood. The Athenians, of all other Greeks, were the\r\nthoughtful, progressive intelligence of the nation. The poets compiled\r\nthe geneaologies and histories of the gods, the heroes, and the past\r\nrecords of the people. There was no other literature, there were no other\r\nsources of information but those from which the poets drew—tradition and\r\ninherited customs. Of these the poets explained the origin and reason,\r\nand no one thought of questioning their tales. They were supposed to be\r\ninspired; and their marvelous legends rested, to a certain extent, on\r\nmonuments, habits, and oral tradition. Their lively narratives charmed\r\nand satisfied the public mind and gratified their pride. It was only in\r\nlater years that the philosophers explained them away.\r\n\r\nIn the early days they had no standard by which to criticise them. All\r\nthey required was that they should offer a pleasing explanation. The\r\nwisest of the Greeks came, ultimately, to believe in one God who ruled\r\nwith wisdom and justice, and they laid the foundation of all useful\r\nknowledge by teaching men to think and reason; but true science was not\r\npossible in their age of the world. They, however, prepared the way for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n9. Their religion was cheerful and bright, they had altars and temples in\r\ngreat numbers, and countless ceremonies in honor of particular deities.\r\nOne class of these was festivals, or games, established, according to\r\ntradition, by their divine heroes. The Olympian Games were the most\r\ncelebrated, and took place every fiftieth month at Olympia. In the year\r\n776 B. C. they began to record the name of the victor in these games,\r\nand as that was done ever afterward, this became a fixed date and the\r\ninterval between each was called an Olympiad. It was the beginning of\r\nreliable history, although it was one hundred and fifty years later that\r\nmen of real wisdom, extensive observation and careful study began to\r\nflourish. But the eagerness with which the people sought information, and\r\nthe honor in which they held men of thought and wisdom, encouraged study,\r\nreflection and travel for the sake of knowledge, so that this class, in\r\ntime, became extremely numerous.\r\n\r\nTheir researches, and systems of what they held to be truth, were often\r\nimperfect, and, in many parts, false; but they were upright and earnest\r\nin the studies that were then possible, and did as much good, one might\r\nsay, by their failures as by their successes. Inquirers, in after times,\r\nnoted _where_ and _how_ they failed; so that all their pioneer work was\r\nuseful—their mistakes for a warning, their success for instruction.\r\n\r\n10. The course of Grecian development took two contrary directions, under\r\nthe two leading states, Sparta and Athens. The last represents the\r\ngenerally received idea of Greece—as a land where the people were lively\r\nand beautiful, intelligent and richly endowed with _taste_ in the arts,\r\nor an exquisitely quick and thorough _judgment_ of _fitness_, developed\r\nto the very highest point. Sparta, on the other hand, through its whole\r\ncareer, was a military state. Somewhere about one hundred years before\r\nthe first Olympiad (B. C. 776), a lawgiver, named Lycurgus, had reformed\r\nthe institutions of the Spartan state with the avowed and only object\r\nto render it capable of producing the most vigorous and hardy warriors.\r\nHe made an equal distribution of lands, which were cultivated by the\r\nancient inhabitants, reduced to slavery. They were called Helots, and\r\nwere treated with great cruelty. Lycurgus abolished every species of\r\nluxury, subjected the young, both boys and girls, to the most rigorous\r\ntraining, and discouraged all the amenities of family and social life\r\nthat he supposed might interfere with the rude hardiness of the soldier.\r\nThe whole intelligence, activity and vigor of the Greek mind was, in\r\nthis state, confined to military life. These institutions continued to\r\nexist in Sparta for more than five hundred years. Among any other race\r\nthey would have secured to them the supreme dominion of the nation; but\r\namong this liberty loving people they merely sufficed to render them\r\nthe general leaders in war, and _one_, only, among the most powerful\r\nand respectable Greek states. Besides, this experiment shows that there\r\nis little real advantage in systematically trampling down the native\r\ninstincts of humanity in order to promote superiority in a particular\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n11. The entirely spontaneous character of the Athenians made them, in\r\ngeneral, the equal of the Spartans in military fame, and gloriously\r\neminent in many other directions. But the various members of the Greek\r\nnation seem to have been made, by their intelligence and the earnestness,\r\nthe completeness, of all their lines of development, the pioneers of\r\nhumanity in their experiments. They exhausted all the capacities of a\r\ncomplete military education in an entire state, and presented the most\r\nperfect achievements of a genius that had no models to commence on, in\r\npoetry, in painting, in sculpture, in philosophy and in such elements of\r\nscience as were possible to humanity in their day.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that most of the Greek colonies, the Phenicians\r\nand their colonies, and a great part of the numerous nations in Italy\r\nbecame republican about the same time—as did the Romans later—and that\r\nthose states which preserved hereditary monarchy, or tyrants—as those\r\nkings were called who were elected by the populace—had counterbalanced\r\nthe individual despotism of the kingly office by various institutions\r\nthat controlled and limited it.\r\n\r\n12. At the period when history began to be carefully written and dates\r\naccurately given, civilization was under full career and rapidly moving\r\nwestward. The Greeks had been struggling with the difficulties of\r\nthe early times for more than a thousand years and had already begun\r\nto mature the institutions and to show the traits of character that\r\nafterwards made them so eminent and so useful in advancing the progress\r\nof mankind. The Tyrians, or commercial people of Phenicia, had formed\r\nthe net-work of communication with all the parts of the earth then\r\nsufficiently civilized to produce anything which could be useful to\r\nthe rest of the world, and Italy was alive with the energies of the\r\nprimitive races, mainly Aryan—some of them transplanted from the East,\r\nand possessing many of the highest elements of the ancient culture—who\r\nfought the Romans with a vigor and persistence that contributed much to\r\nthe discipline and strong development of that remarkable people, to whose\r\ninstruction the Greek colonies in eastern Italy added not a little.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the advance of the center of development toward the\r\nwestern continent, and of mental preparation for more perfect ideals of\r\ngovernment was continuous. A more complete view of this progress will be\r\ngained by considering the general events of each century apart, or in\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\n13. B. C. 776. This is the first definite and positive date in reliable\r\nhistory and commences the First Olympiad. The Olympic religious and\r\nnational festival was celebrated by foot and chariot races, boxing,\r\nwrestling, etc., and was commenced by religious sacrifices and\r\nceremonies, mainly in honor of the god Apollo. This peaceable assembly\r\nof all the representatives of the Grecian race was one of the chief\r\nmeans of maintaining the national union, and greatly promoted the\r\nmaintenance and importance of a kind of national congress, called the\r\nAmphictyonic League. The first object of this League was the protection\r\nof their common worship; but it came to have, afterward, considerable\r\nimportance as a political body; its decrees having the character and\r\nforce of the Laws of Nations in modern times. It was composed of two\r\ndelegates from each of the twelve leading states of Greece, and held two\r\nmeetings yearly; one at Delphi, where was a celebrated temple and oracle\r\nof Apollo, and one at Thermopylæ. The twelve chief cities of the Æolian\r\ncolonies of Greece in Asia Minor, and also the same number of Ionian\r\ncolonies on the same coast more to the south, had each Amphictyonic,\r\nor International Leagues; but the Greeks from all the various regions\r\nthey settled, as well as from the mother country, took a pride in\r\nparticipating in the Olympic games.\r\n\r\n14. B. C. 753. This is one of the most important dates in the history\r\nof mankind. In this year, Rome, “The Eternal City,” was founded by a\r\nband of adventurers and outlaws, under the lead of the twin brothers,\r\nRomulus and Remus. A spirit of adventure was the most characteristic\r\nfeature of that era, in Greece and about the Mediterranean sea, together\r\nwith a passion for colonizing, or founding new states. Education, or\r\ngrowth, seems to pursue parallel lines in the same era, so that the same\r\ngeneral tendencies move the masses of widely separated nations. Greece\r\nbegan, at this period, to send out a large number of colonists, in rapid\r\nsuccession, to Italy and the islands of the Mediterranean. The tendency\r\nhad commenced more than three centuries before, but the colonies had\r\nnot gone far from the native state, and only one had been established in\r\nItaly, at Cumæ. Carthage, a commercial colony of the Tyrians, had been\r\nfounded 127 years before, and was now beginning to rival the parent city.\r\n\r\nRome gathered its population from all the neighboring states. The\r\nmingling of races has always been favorable to the progress of mankind.\r\nA single race, isolating itself and receiving no new blood or impulses\r\nfrom without becomes stationary and fixed in all its habits and\r\nadvancement ceases beyond a certain point. The men who founded Rome were,\r\napparently, a crowd of adventurers who had resolved to found a state.\r\nAfter building the walls of their city and providing themselves with\r\nhabitations, they were destitute of wives—a serious want which would soon\r\nleave their new city without inhabitants. They remedied it in true Roman\r\nstyle—by violence. They made a festival without the walls to celebrate\r\nthe founding of their state, and invited their nearest neighbors, the\r\nSabines, to take part in it. The Sabines came with their wives and\r\ndaughters. At a concerted moment the young Romans each seized a young\r\nSabine woman, and carried her off into the city; the gates were closed\r\nand each proceeded to make his captive his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Sabines were powerless to prevent the deed, but they soon made war on\r\ntheir violent sons-in-law, and the young city would have been destroyed\r\nbut for the interference of the stolen women who had become satisfied\r\nwith the bold deed which gave them valiant husbands. The Sabines were\r\ninduced to unite with the young state so far as to build a new city\r\nadjoining and take part in its rising fortunes. Romulus was elected king\r\nby his followers, but popular institutions were established to limit his\r\npower, under the strong instinct of vigorous organization that, from the\r\nfirst, characterized the new nation. The people maintained their right to\r\nmake laws in conjunction with the king, and preserved a limited monarchy\r\nfor 250 years. At this time the prophet Isaiah flourished in Judea, and\r\nthe kingdom of Samaria was approaching extinction.\r\n\r\n15. B. C. 747. The Chaldeans established, or revived, their dominion\r\nin Babylon, under their king, Nabonassur, and seem to have been\r\nindependent of Assyria for a time, but afterward to have been brought\r\ninto a qualified subjection to that enterprising monarchy. It commences\r\nauthentic history in the East, so far as well ascertained dates are\r\nconcerned. In that year the Chaldean astronomers or priests, first\r\nintroduced the Egyptian solar year, which furnished an accurate mode of\r\nmeasuring time. This was about the commencement of the Sixth Olympiad.\r\nEgypt was approaching its most perfect condition under its ancient system.\r\n\r\nB. C. 743. Messenian war of 23 years—Sparta conquers Messene.\r\n\r\n16. B. C. 735. A colony from Corinth founded the celebrated city of\r\nSyracuse in Sicily, and a fashion of colonizing seems to have obtained in\r\nGreece, which continued for a hundred years. The native enterprise of the\r\nGreeks, the great increase of inhabitants in their small territory, and\r\nthe commotions and contests of parties in their states, which preceded\r\nthe establishment of more complete popular governments, were probably the\r\nruling causes of these foreign emigrations, and all contributed to the\r\nincrease of knowledge, improvement in navigation, and the prevalence of\r\na commercial spirit. Miletus, the leading Greek city of Ionia, in Asia\r\nMinor, became almost as powerful and prosperous by her commerce as Tyre\r\nin her best days. There were Grecian colonies on the coast of Africa\r\nwest of Egypt, on the eastern coast of Italy, several in Sicily, one\r\nin France. They were, generally, very enterprising and prosperous, and\r\ndiffused Greek intelligence and culture over a large part of the world\r\nas known at that time. They usually established a republican government.\r\nSyracuse remained republican for 251 years.\r\n\r\n17. B. C. 728. The Assyrian Empire was now having its palmiest days, and\r\nspreading its dominion over all the central parts of western Asia, from\r\nthe Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. At this time Shalman-assur, or\r\nShalmaneser, the king of Assyria, led away the Ten Tribes of Israel into\r\na hopeless captivity, and planted a different race in Samaria. Soon after\r\nthis time the Ethiopians from the upper Nile established their dominion\r\nin Egypt, without apparently changing the general condition of things\r\nthere. Three Ethiopian kings successively reigned in Egypt, and made\r\nconquests in Asia to some extent.\r\n\r\n18. B. C. 600. About the beginning of this century the foundation of\r\nGreek philosophy was laid by Thales of Miletus, a Greek city in Asia. He\r\nrepresents the growth and acuteness of the Greek mind and the approach\r\nof its period of greatest activity. He travelled into Egypt in search\r\nof wisdom, and was the most able astronomer of his times. He calculated\r\nan eclipse of the sun, which, coming on just when two armies, the\r\nMedian and Lydian, were about to engage in battle, so terrified them\r\nthat they immediately separated and made peace. He was celebrated as a\r\nmathematician, and taught many truths concerning the existence of God\r\nwhich were far in advance of his time, and undertook to account for the\r\norigin of all things in a very bold and independent manner. He was one\r\nof the famous “Seven Wise Men” of Greece. Solon was held to be the first\r\namong the seven. He was an Athenian law-giver and writer, and established\r\na very wise and enlightened system of government in Athens. He was a\r\npure-hearted and clear-sighted man, enjoying the universal respect of\r\nthe Greeks. Chilo, another of the seven, was a Spartan magistrate,\r\nheld in the highest esteem for his wisdom. Pittacus of Mitylene, was\r\na law-giver, held in high honor. Bias of Priene, in Ionia, was a very\r\nnoble-hearted and public-spirited citizen, of universal reputation for\r\nwisdom. Cleobulus, of the island of Rhodes, was remarkable for his skill\r\nin answering difficult questions, and Periander of Corinth, the ruler, or\r\ntyrant, of that place, was the last of the seven. They were all living\r\nat the same time. They were only the most eminent among a people who\r\ncould fully appreciate mental ability. The spirit of inquiry continued\r\nto spread rapidly for two hundred years, when the greatest masters, who\r\nimmortalized themselves and their race by their genius, appeared.\r\n\r\n19. In the early part of this century the kingdom of Lydia, in the\r\ncentral part of Asia Minor, rose to great wealth and power. The Lydian\r\nkingdom was ancient—many of its customs being similar to those of the\r\nEgyptians—and the Etrurians of Italy, a much more polished and cultivated\r\npeople than the Romans who conquered them, are thought, by some eminent\r\nhistorians, to have been a Lydian colony planted in Italy in unknown\r\ntimes. The Lydian kings made war on the Asiatic Greek colonies and\r\nreduced many of them to subjection. Crœsus, the last king of Lydia, was\r\nproverbial for his vast wealth. He was conquered by Cyrus, the Persian,\r\nin the middle of the next century.\r\n\r\n679 B. C. Numa, the second king of Rome, is said to have died. The Romans\r\nabstained from war during nearly the whole of his reign, which was\r\noccupied in settling the internal affairs of the new state, especially\r\nthose relating to religion. He was followed by Tullus Hostilius, a very\r\nwarlike prince, who did much to extend the Roman state.\r\n\r\n20. About 650 B. C. a great change was introduced into Egypt, by\r\nPsammeticus, its king, who, having several rival claimants to the throne,\r\nemployed the services of Greek soldiers to overcome them. For the first\r\ntime the country was freely opened to foreigners, and the power of the\r\npriesthood broken. Thus the Greeks were instrumental in changing the\r\ncurrent of Egyptian history.\r\n\r\nThe Median Kings began to make head in the east, and ventured—after\r\nvarious successful efforts to extend their dominion in other\r\ndirections—to make direct war on Nineveh. At the close of the century,\r\nby the aid of the rebellious Nabopolassar, they succeeded in taking and\r\ndestroying that city, and the whole of that immense empire was divided\r\nbetween Media and Nabopolassar, who made Babylon his capital.\r\n\r\n21. B. C. 590 to 500. Events in this century begin to crowd thick upon\r\neach other. The Greeks rapidly advanced; the Romans succeeded, amid\r\nconstant wars, in securely establishing their state in Italy, marching\r\nfrom conquest to conquest, not without heavy reverses at times, from\r\nwhich they soon recovered.\r\n\r\n    598—Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem for the first time.\r\n\r\n    594—Solon was made archon at Athens, with almost unlimited\r\n      power to change the existing institutions, and he introduced\r\n      many very useful reforms.\r\n\r\n    588—Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, and the Jews\r\n      carried into captivity to Babylon, where they remained\r\n      seventy years. Soon after, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Tyre,\r\n      after a siege of many years, but he found himself in\r\n      possession of the walls only, for the inhabitants had built\r\n      another city on an island near by, but inaccessible to the\r\n      conqueror, and left him a barren conquest.\r\n\r\n    560—The most memorable event that followed was the union of\r\n      Media and Persia under the military prowess of Cyrus. He\r\n      first employed the forces of the Medo-Persian kingdom in\r\n      Asia Minor, conquering Lydia and the rest of that region,\r\n\r\n    549—and dethroning Crœsus. Babylon and Egypt had both\r\n      entered into an alliance with Crœsus against Cyrus, but\r\n      before they could send Crœsus effectual aid Cyrus had\r\n      triumphed. He then turned his arms against Babylon\r\n\r\n    538—which he took by stratagem after a long siege. Egypt\r\n      was afterward obliged to become tributary to the universal\r\n      conqueror.\r\n\r\n    534—Cyrus, who had before been the Persian general of the\r\n      united armies under the Median king, Cyaxares, who was his\r\n      maternal uncle, succeeded to the kingdom, and soon after sent\r\n      the Jews home to their native land. During this period the\r\n      Greeks swarmed on the eastern part of the Mediterranean sea\r\n      and carried on nearly all its commerce, the Tyrians being\r\n      mainly confined to the trade with India, Arabia and the\r\n      various parts of the Persian empire.\r\n\r\n    529—Occurred the death of Cyrus, full of years and glory.\r\n      History has described him as the most amiable of all the\r\n      great conquerors. He was succeeded by his son, Cambyses, who,\r\n      to punish the revolt of the Egyptians\r\n\r\n    525—invaded that country and made it a Persian province.\r\n\r\n    522—Cambyses died and was succeeded by a Persian nobleman,\r\n      Darius Hystaspes, the line of Cyrus being extinct. He finally\r\n      broke the power of the priesthood in his dominions, which\r\n      perished at once in Egypt and Babylon, where they had so long\r\n      reigned supreme over the minds of men.\r\n\r\n    515—The second temple was dedicated at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n    510—In this year occurred a very important event in Roman\r\n      history—the establishment of the republic. Kings had reigned\r\n      there two hundred and forty-three years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n1. The Romans, more than any other people of ancient times, understood\r\nhow to establish a well ordered state. Respect for order and law\r\namong them was very great. The idea of a government with a definite\r\nconstitution, which the rulers should always respect, and which should\r\nbe an adequate bulwark to the people against oppression, had never\r\noccurred to any of the Asiatic nations. The nearest approach to it among\r\nthe Greeks was in Sparta; but as their aim was directed, not so much\r\nto the general welfare of the state as to training a race of soldiers,\r\ntheir experiment was a failure. The Greeks had a great impatience of\r\nsubjection; they had no great ambition to rule, but were impulsive, and\r\neach state wanted freedom to pursue its own particular fancy. Their\r\nexhaustless energy and acute minds were devoted to the pursuit of ideal\r\nobjects. Even the sober and resolute Spartan put aside every other\r\nconsideration in order to realize his idea of a well formed, thoroughly\r\ntrained, and invincible warrior. Weakly and deformed children were\r\ndestroyed in their infancy, by order of the state. The young women were\r\nsubjected to the most rigorous physical training, that they might become\r\nmothers of hardy children. Physical training was one of the passions\r\nof all Greece, originating in their delight in beauty and symmetry of\r\nperson. Sports that contributed to this were as pleasing to the Greeks as\r\nto our modern school-boys.\r\n\r\n2. Athens, which most perfectly represented the Grecian mind, esteemed\r\na fine poet, an able writer, a skillful painter or sculptor, as much\r\nas an enthusiastic scholar of our day can do. They had a passion for\r\nbeauty, and their love of liberty was in great part produced by their\r\nardent longing for mental freedom and the gratification of their mental\r\ntastes. The worship of their gods was chiefly their admiration for\r\nsuperhuman majesty, sublimity, and beauty, as they conceived them, and\r\ntheir theology was compounded of their thirst for knowledge and their\r\nlove of the mysterious, the grand, the terrible, and the beautiful. Life\r\nwas of no value to them, if they could not gratify these instincts, and\r\ntheir tenacity in maintaining their liberties found its inspiration in\r\nthem. They were a nation of mental enthusiasts. They had no love of\r\nconquest for the sake of power. They were invaded by the Persians, and\r\na handful of Greeks conquered its immense hosts with ease, by their\r\nintelligence and ardor. It was only when they saw the splendor and\r\nwealth of the East, and felt that they could repeat the glorious deeds\r\nof their mythic heroes, that they became enthusiastic over the romantic\r\nidea of conquering a magnificent empire. It was the mental charm of the\r\nundertaking that gave to Alexander his miraculous success.\r\n\r\nBut the Greeks were not practical. They wanted worldly wisdom. The\r\nLacedemonians of Sparta had no adequate object when they sacrificed\r\nalmost all that common humanity holds dear, to rear up model soldiers.\r\nTheir ambition was confined mainly to preserving the headship of their\r\nstate among the petty republics of Greece; and the resources of all the\r\nstates were wasted in the effort to preserve a balance of power among the\r\nvarious members of the nation; or in struggles of the more powerful to\r\nobtain a leading influence. They had little political wisdom, when the\r\nindependence of their territories was secured and the governments that\r\nrestrained them too much from their favorite enthusiasms were abolished.\r\nAthens and all Greece admired immensely the wise measures of Solon, when\r\nhe reformed the government and gave it excellent laws. But they had not\r\nthe prudence to maintain them. In ten years all was again confusion. Most\r\nof their great men who possessed a special genius for government, were\r\nabandoned when they showed the most ability for benefitting their country\r\nby their wise statesmanship. Pericles alone, who was the most perfect\r\nembodiment of Grecian character, preserved his influence to the last; but\r\nit was by falling in perfectly with the tone of Grecian feeling, and he\r\nlaid the foundation of innovations that corrupted and finally overthrew\r\ntheir liberty. He was as little practical and prudent as his countrymen.\r\nBeautiful in person, cultivated in mind, possessed of exquisite taste\r\nin literature and art, to which he devoted himself with boundless\r\nenthusiasm, Greece could always appreciate him. His age was the glory\r\nand joy of Greece; but when more homely political virtues were required\r\nto preserve his creations and protect this literary and artistic state,\r\nthe people could not follow them. Their best statesmen were ostracised,\r\nbanished, or slain, when their practical genius was most needed.\r\n\r\n3. Rome was the opposite of this. She had a genius for producing and\r\npreserving a constitution, adding to it by slow degrees, maintaining\r\nchecks and balances that preserved the machinery in working order, and\r\nrendered it capable of producing the most valuable results that were\r\npossible in those times. To rule was her passion. She was not wanting in\r\nintelligence, but it was the homely prudence of common life, the skill\r\nto adapt means to ends. Of all the nations, she was the first to carry\r\norganization into every part of her government, and conduct everything by\r\ninexorable system and order. If Rome was resolved to rule others, she was\r\nno less resolved to rule herself. The mission of Greece was in the domain\r\nof thought, to develop the intellectual capabilities of mankind. That of\r\nRome also required intelligence, but of a lower and more material kind.\r\nShe was to teach mankind to follow an orderly development, to introduce\r\nsystem, to prevent ruinous clashing of interests, to teach respect for\r\nlaw. Greece taught the world to think to purpose; Rome to govern with\r\neffect. Each served an important purpose. Without either the world was\r\nnot prepared for Christianity, which added moral order, nor for true\r\nscience, which was the mature fruit of these three, and prepared the\r\nperfect civilization which was to be developed to its conclusion in a New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n4. Rome commenced, not with the king, but with the _Senate_—a body of\r\nexperienced men, who made the laws and appointed a king to administer\r\nthem. The king, except in time of war, was only the executive, the\r\nchief magistrate. The later kings were restive under this restraint and\r\nsought to place themselves above law, and the Romans at once dismissed\r\nthem, appointing various officers to fill their place. The fundamental\r\nprinciples of government were not changed at all, or very little, except\r\nby the subsequent course of development. The Romans knew how to adapt\r\ntheir invincible spirit of order to all changing circumstances, and when\r\nexternal changes arose corresponding changes were developed, in a regular\r\nmanner, within.\r\n\r\nThus the Roman _spirit_ was constant under the regal government,\r\nthroughout the republic, and to the close of the empire, and had then\r\nbecome so thoroughly established in laws and institutions as to govern\r\nthe development of the new states that rose out of its ruins and\r\nproduced modern civilization.\r\n\r\nAt first the Roman government consisted only of the Senate and the king.\r\nThe Senate was chosen from the body of citizens, and represented them.\r\nIn the course of time the descendants of the first people became the\r\naristocracy, called patricians, who enjoyed great privileges. A class\r\nwas gradually formed called the _plebs_, or common people, who, for some\r\ntime, had no share in the government. The patricians alone could hold\r\noffice, and marriage between them and plebians was illegal. But, says\r\nan able writer, “the Roman commons were the greatest commons the world\r\never saw, except the commons of England and America.” In the course of\r\ntime, by wise and prudent management, and taking advantage of favoring\r\ncircumstances, resulting from the fact that they supplied the body\r\nof soldiers to the state, without revolution, breaking the laws, or\r\nviolating the ancient constitution, they obtained changes or additions\r\nto it, one after another, until they had acquired a due influence in the\r\nconduct of affairs and became fully a match for the patricians. It was a\r\nnew lesson to mankind, and one that has had great influence on the good\r\norder of society in all later times.\r\n\r\n5. The religious system of that great people was conducted with as much\r\nworldly prudence as all their other affairs. Their religious ceremonies\r\nwere, in great part, derived from the Etruscans. They were conducted\r\nwith much pomp by state officers, appointed for the purpose, embodying\r\nall the superstitions of the time, and embracing comparatively little of\r\nthe lofty sentiment that was so prominent in Greece. Their religion was\r\nan affair of state, and intimately connected with the political working\r\nof the government. The gravest public business was made to depend on the\r\nflight of birds, on omens and accidents, and on the appearance of the\r\nentrails of the animals offered in the sacrifices. An artful use of these\r\ncircumstances enabled the officers in power to compass many political\r\nends. Their original gods were those of Greece, adapted to their\r\npurposes and national character; but they readily adopted the divinities\r\nof all the nations they conquered. Their religion was in a high degree\r\ncool and calculating.\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations apply especially to the periods of Greece and\r\nRome when their peculiarities were most fully developed in the days of\r\ntheir greatest glory. Though always more or less characteristic, in later\r\ntimes they melted more or less into one another, or were toned down and\r\ntransformed by decay and a rising spirit of innovation. Especially were\r\nthey displaced by Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nGREECE AND ROME.\r\n\r\n1. We are now prepared to return to the year\r\n\r\n    500 B. C.—and follow events in chronological order, with a\r\n      fair appreciation of their import. Just before the close\r\n      of the last century, Darius Hystaspes, the king of Persia,\r\n      sent an army into Europe, to the north of Greece, to\r\n      chastise the Scythians, and it conquered Thrace. The Greek\r\n      colonies in Asia Minor, which had been recently added to\r\n      the Persian empire, became restive under foreign control,\r\n      and when the Persian army returned home,\r\n    500—organized a rebellion and took and burned the city of\r\n      Sardis, the ancient capital of Lydia. They were assisted by\r\n      the European Greeks; but the vast resources of Persia soon\r\n      enabled Darius to take vengeance on them, and Miletus was\r\n      besieged and destroyed. Darius summoned the Grecian states\r\n      to offer their submission, but Athens and Sparta sent back\r\n      a defiance. Darius thereupon gathered a large armament and\r\n      prepared to invade\r\n    495—Greece, which he commenced by the conquest of Macedon. But\r\n      a tempest destroyed his ships and 20,000 men, and the\r\n      expedition returned to Persia. In the same year the\r\n      Roman plebeians obtained their first success against the\r\n      patricians, by which the debts of the poor plebeians to the\r\n      wealthy patricians were cancelled and Tribunes of the People\r\n      appointed.\r\n\r\n    490—This year the glory of Greece broke forth. Darius having\r\n      sent another and larger army into Greece, it advanced on\r\n      Athens and encamped at Marathon, within twenty-two miles of\r\n      the city. The Persian host was said to number from 100,000\r\n      to 200,000 men. The Athenians had but 10,000 citizens, but\r\n      armed 20,000 slaves, and the city of Platæa sent them 1,000\r\n      troops. Miltiades, the very able Athenian general, marched\r\n      out and, taking a good position, offered battle. It was\r\n      the 20th of September. The little army of the Greeks\r\n      obtained a complete victory and the Persians returned home in\r\n      confusion. The great services of Miltiades were rewarded with\r\n      imprisonment, on a frivolous charge, and he died there of his\r\n      wounds.\r\n\r\n    485—Darius Hystaspes, the Persian king, died while preparing\r\n      a still larger armament for the invasion of Greece.\r\n\r\n    484—An insurrection in Egypt completely subdued by the\r\n      Persians.\r\n\r\n    480—Xerxes, king of Persia, invaded Greece with a million\r\n      soldiers. The battle at the pass of Thermopylæ was fought\r\n      by a thousand Spartans under Leonidas, their king, and all\r\n      but one slain. The Persian fleet was beaten the same day by\r\n      Themistocles, the Athenian admiral. Xerxes soon advanced on\r\n      Athens, which was abandoned by its inhabitants and burned by\r\n      the Persians. Soon after, Themistocles fought the Persian\r\n      navy again at Salamis and totally destroyed it. Xerxes,\r\n      leaving a large army in Greece, returned to Asia.\r\n\r\n    479—The battle of Platæa ended the Persian invasion. The\r\n      allied Greek army numbered 70,000, under Pausanias, the\r\n      Spartan king; the Persians 300,000. The Persians are said\r\n      to have had 200,000 slain, and their army was totally\r\n      routed. Another victory was gained on the coast of Asia Minor\r\n      the same day, and the last remnants of the Persian fleet\r\n      destroyed.\r\n\r\n    478—Athens was rebuilt and surrounded with walls from the\r\n      treasures of the conquered Persians. This was the age\r\n      of great men in Greece. Phidias, her greatest sculptor,\r\n      flourished at this time. The Persians, at the time of their\r\n      first invasion, brought a piece of marble to commemorate\r\n      the victory of which they were confident. The Greeks caused\r\n      Phidias to produce out of it a statue of Nemesis, the goddess\r\n      of vengeance, and set it up on the field of Marathon.\r\n\r\n    478—Themistocles died in banishment about this time, and\r\n      Aristides of old age. Both were leading statesmen and\r\n      generals of Athens during the Persian war.\r\n\r\n    470—Socrates, the most eminent philosopher of all ancient\r\n      times, was born this year.\r\n\r\n    ”—The death of Xerxes by assassination occurred this year.\r\n\r\n    466—Cimon, son of Miltiades, was now the great man of\r\n      Athens. He was soon superseded by Pericles. From 480 B. C.\r\n      to 430 was the golden period of Athens. She was pre-eminent\r\n      politically, conducting the war of the Grecian allies\r\n      against Persian supremacy on the western shores of Asia and\r\n      in the Mediterranean sea. Republican liberty was everywhere\r\n      predominant. The greatest writers, painters and sculptors\r\n      lived in this period or immediately after it. Socrates,\r\n      Plato, Aristotle, philosophers; Æschylus, Sophocles,\r\n      Euripides, tragic poets; Zeuxis and Apelles, painters; and\r\n      Phidias in sculpture, were a few among the many great names\r\n      which are found in or immediately following this period.\r\n\r\n    457—Cincinnatus was made dictator at Rome. During this\r\n      period the Romans laid the foundation of their dominion over\r\n      all Italy by waging successful war with the Etruscans and\r\n      Samnites, the most vigorous and powerful of their opponents.\r\n\r\n    450—The Decemvirate was appointed at Rome. They were ten\r\n      magistrates empowered to produce a more perfect code. It was\r\n      called the “Laws of the Twelve Tables.” The plebeians about\r\n      this time succeeded in wresting important privileges from the\r\n      patricians, which more equally balanced the different powers\r\n      of the state.\r\n\r\n2. Athens was the centre of civilization, and Greek culture and ideas\r\nwere penetrating all the nations in her vicinity. Rome was rapidly\r\ndeveloping and Carthage was at the summit of her glory. She had control\r\nof much of the Spanish or Iberian peninsula. Persia, after absorbing all\r\nthe old monarchies of the east, was declining. The “march of empire” was\r\ndistinctly defining its “westward course.”\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of this century that Herodotus, the “Father of\r\nHistory,” was rising to fame, and a few years later Xenophon, the Greek\r\ngeneral and historian, was born. Thucydides, another historian, dates\r\nfrom this period. The great career of history now fairly commenced.\r\n\r\n    443—Herodotus emigrated from Halicarnassus, in Asia, to\r\n      Greece.\r\n\r\n    431—The Peloponnesian war, a bitter contest between Athens\r\n      and Sparta, commenced. It lasted twenty-three years, and was\r\n      again revived, ending in the conquest of Athens by Sparta.\r\n      This war was followed, after some time, by the rise of the\r\n      power of Thebes, under their famous general, Epaminondas, who\r\n      broke the power of Sparta. Thebes sunk into insignificance\r\n      after his death, and Philip of Macedon commenced the\r\n      subjugation of all Greece. He was followed by Alexander the\r\n      Great, who, in return for the loss of republican liberty,\r\n      rendered Greece illustrious by conquering the Persian empire,\r\n      and imbuing all the Eastern World with its philosophy and\r\n      arts. For all these great events one hundred years were\r\n      required.\r\n\r\n    429—The death of the illustrious Pericles occurred in this\r\n      year.\r\n\r\n    ”—Plato, the disciple of Socrates, and, in some points,\r\n      superior to him in mental discipline, was born.\r\n\r\n    420—About this time Alcibiades, the nephew of Pericles,\r\n      became prominent in Athenian affairs. He had brilliant\r\n      powers, but little principle.\r\n\r\n    406—The battle of Ægospotamos, gained by Lysander the\r\n      Spartan, broke the power of Athens.\r\n\r\n    404—Athens was taken by Lysander, its walls demolished, and\r\n      the government of the “Thirty Tyrants” established by the\r\n      Spartans. Alcibiades, banished from Athens, was assassinated\r\n      by the Persians, at the instigation of the Spartans.\r\n\r\n    401—Occurred the battle of Cunaxa, in Babylonia, between\r\n      Cyrus, the brother of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, and that\r\n      king. Cyrus, who had been governor, or satrap, in Asia Minor,\r\n      gathered a large army including more than 10,000 Greeks.\r\n      Cyrus was killed and his own army defeated, but the Greeks\r\n      repelled all assaults. Their generals having been decoyed\r\n      into the power of the Persians, on the plea of making terms\r\n      with them, were treacherously slain. The army appointed\r\n      other commanders, chief among whom was Xenophon, afterward\r\n      the celebrated historian, and they made good their return to\r\n      Greece. It was finely described by Xenophon, and known as the\r\n      “Retreat of the Ten Thousand.”\r\n\r\n    400—Socrates taught doctrines too pure and high-toned for his\r\n      countrymen to understand, and was condemned to drink poison,\r\n      as a dangerous man and despiser of the gods, in the 70th year\r\n      of his age. The Athenians soon repented it.\r\n\r\n    396—The capital of Veii, taken by the Romans, ended the\r\n      contest with the Etruscans.\r\n\r\n    389—Rome was conquered and, except the capitol, destroyed, by\r\n      the Gauls under Brennus. The barbarians soon retired and the\r\n      city was rebuilt.\r\n\r\n    384—Aristotle, the most learned of the Grecian philosophers,\r\n      was born at Stagira, in Macedon. He laid the foundation of\r\n      scientific study, and was the tutor of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n    371—Epaminondas defeated the Spartans at Leuctra, and\r\n\r\n    362—again at Mantinea, where he was killed.\r\n\r\n    360—Philip became king of Macedon, and soon began to\r\n      undermine the liberties of Greece in a very artful way.\r\n\r\n    357—The “Sacred War” against the Phocians, who had plundered\r\n      the temple of Apollo, at Delphi, commenced.\r\n\r\n    356—Birth of Alexander the Great. Rutilius, the first plebean\r\n      dictator at Rome.\r\n\r\n    349—Death of Plato, the brightest light of Grecian\r\n      philosophy. He systematized and enlarged the doctrines of\r\n      Socrates.\r\n\r\n    338—Occurred the battle of Chaeronea between Philip and\r\n      the allied Athenians and Thebans. The Greeks were totally\r\n      defeated and their liberty lost. Demosthenes, the most\r\n      celebrated orator of the Greeks, spent his whole life and\r\n      his magnificent eloquence in the effort to rouse the Greeks\r\n      against Philip; but Philip was too crafty and the Greeks too\r\n      little accustomed to act in concert. For nearly a hundred\r\n      years the states of Greece had been exhausted by wars among\r\n      themselves, and they were too weary of fighting to make\r\n      the necessary effort against so powerful and skillful an\r\n      adversary.\r\n\r\n    336—Philip was assassinated on the eve of an expedition\r\n      against Persia, as chief of the Grecian states. This popular\r\n      idea consoled them for the loss of liberty. Alexander\r\n      succeeded his father.\r\n\r\n    335—Thebes rebelled against Alexander, and he took and\r\n      destroyed that ancient city.\r\n\r\n    334—Alexander carried out the project of his father and\r\n      invaded the Persian empire. The battle of the Granicus, his\r\n      first great victory, took place this year.\r\n\r\n    333—Darius, the Persian king, was again thoroughly defeated\r\n      in the battle of Issus. Damascus, in Syria, was taken and\r\n      Tyre besieged by Alexander.\r\n\r\n    332—Tyre was taken and finally destroyed, and Alexandria, at\r\n      the mouth of the Nile, founded.\r\n\r\n    331—A final battle at Arbela, in Assyria, overthrew the\r\n      Persian Empire. Darius escaped, but was murdered by Bessus,\r\n      one of his officers. Four years were spent by the Greeks in\r\n      subduing the wild tribes on the eastern border of the Empire,\r\n      and settling the government of these vast conquests.\r\n\r\n    327—Alexander invaded India and was constantly triumphant\r\n      till his soldiers refused to go farther from home. They had\r\n      grown tired of conquering, and Alexander reluctantly returned\r\n      to Babylon to consolidate his government.\r\n\r\n    323—Alexander died of a fever, the result of excessive\r\n      drinking. He left no heir, and his generals divided his\r\n      empire.\r\n\r\n    322—The Samnites obtained a temporary success by surprising\r\n      a Roman army in a narrow defile of the mountains called\r\n      the Candine Forks, and subjected it to a humiliating\r\n      capitulation. The Romans never bowed before misfortune or\r\n      defeat. They prosecuted the war with invincible resolution\r\n      until the Samnite power was wholly broken, a contest, in all,\r\n      of about 50 years, which was soon followed by the complete\r\n      subjugation of the whole peninsula.\r\n\r\n3. In this year died the two greatest Grecians, Demosthenes, the orator,\r\nby suicide; and Aristotle, by old age. On the death of Alexander,\r\nDemosthenes aroused the Athenians to make a stand for their liberties.\r\nFew of the Grecian states joined them and they were totally defeated\r\nby Antipater, the governor appointed by Alexander. Demosthenes avoided\r\npunishment by taking poison. The Achaian League, about forty years after,\r\nmaintained the liberties of Greece for fifty years or more, which then\r\nfell before the invincible Romans. For many years all the eastern world\r\nwas in confusion from the struggles of competitors for the Empire of\r\nAlexander. Ptolemy established himself soon and firmly in Egypt, and\r\nSeleucus, after various\r\n\r\n    312—Reverses, obtained full possession of the eastern parts\r\n      of the empire, Babylonia, Assyria and Persia. This year is\r\n      called the era of the Seleucidæ. Asia Minor and Greece were a\r\n      scene of the greatest confusion for seventy years, so far as\r\n      rulers were concerned. But nearly all these were Greeks, and\r\n      Greek culture and philosophy exerted a wide spread influence.\r\n      In the end it became fully evident that the want of genius in\r\n      the Greek mind to organize, and steadiness in Greek character\r\n      to sustain, settled institutions was absolute. They had,\r\n      at different times, men of the greatest ability, but when\r\n      they passed away their plans and institutions perished with\r\n      them. The acute and accomplished Greeks were ever children\r\n      in the science of government, and the advent of Rome alone,\r\n      whose special skill was in government, saved the world from\r\n      irretrievable anarchy or fatal despotism.\r\n\r\n    300—The Roman plebeans completed their struggle for\r\n      constitutional liberty by acquiring a share in the priestly\r\n      office, which was essential to the full value of their other\r\n      victories over the patricians, and the Roman constitution was\r\n      complete. It was maintained very fairly for more that one\r\n      hundred and fifty years, when the spoils of their conquests\r\n      corrupted the virtue of the citizens and produced the\r\n      internal disorder that, about a century later still brought\r\n      about the establishment of the Roman Empire. Yet the forms\r\n      of government, municipal and other regulations, and the\r\n      administration of justice, though often interfered with in\r\n      particular cases, were so well settled on sound principles,\r\n      and secured so uniformly the welfare of society, that they\r\n      were preserved longest from general ruin, and revived first\r\n      in more modern times. Greek thought and culture, and Roman\r\n      law remained indestructible.\r\n\r\n    290—The Samnites, Sabines and Gauls, being all defeated,\r\n      Rome was virtually mistress of Italy, although the Grecian\r\n      cities on the eastern coast remained to be subdued. They had\r\n      little strength in themselves against a power so warlike,\r\n      and invited Pyrrhus, the king of\r\n\r\n    281—Epirus, to their assistance. He twice defeated the Roman\r\n      consuls, but they inflicted on him so much loss that they\r\n      vainly offered him battle immediately after, and rejected all\r\n      his overtures to treat for peace. He was at length vanquished\r\n      and obliged to abandon Italy to the Republic.\r\n\r\n4. The Romans soon subdued all opposition and began to look about for\r\nother lands to conquer.\r\n\r\n    264—The Carthaginians, on the opposite coast of Africa,\r\n      had become a colossal power, and sought to establish their\r\n      control over Sicily—not an easy task, since it had many\r\n      colonies of Greeks whose national spirit and bravery did\r\n      not desert them. In this year a call for assistance from a\r\n      plundering band who had captured a Greek city, a part of\r\n      whom had also invited Carthaginian aid, brought Rome and\r\n      Carthage in conflict. The Carthaginians were enraged at this\r\n      interference with an island which they had long intended to\r\n      make their own, and raised an immense army to drive out the\r\n      intruders. The Romans defeated the army and took Agrigentum,\r\n      one of the best strongholds of the Carthaginians on the\r\n      island.\r\n\r\n    260—The Carthaginians were masters of the sea, and the Romans\r\n      had little knowledge of naval affairs. Taking a Carthaginian\r\n      vessel which had been driven ashore for a model, they, in\r\n      a short time, created a fleet and worsted their enemies on\r\n      their own special element.\r\n\r\n    256—The Romans again defeated the Carthaginians in a sea\r\n      fight near the island of Lipara.\r\n\r\n    255—The Romans determined to carry the war into Africa,\r\n      and fitting out a large fleet, inflicted a still heavier\r\n      loss on the Carthaginian armaments, landed in Africa and\r\n      defeated an immense army. The Carthaginians sued for peace,\r\n      but the terms proposed by Regulus, the Roman general, were\r\n      so severe that they resolved to continue the war. A Grecian\r\n      general, Xanthippus, took command of their army and totally\r\n      defeated the Romans, taking Regulus prisoner, and destroying\r\n      or\r\n    248—capturing all his army but 2000. The Romans lost\r\n      three fleets by storms, but conquered once in a sea fight,\r\n      and defeated an army in Sicily. The Carthaginians again\r\n      sought peace, but the Romans would not abate their first\r\n      terms, and continued the war until the\r\n    240—Carthaginians, completely humbled, accepted the severe\r\n      alternative of submission or destruction. The temple of\r\n      Janus, the god of war, never shut but in time of absolute\r\n      peace, was now closed for the second time since the building\r\n      of the city.\r\n\r\n      The people, whose special occupation was war, soon grew\r\n      tired of peace, and carried on various conflicts with the\r\n      Gauls settled at the foot of the Alps in the\r\n    227—north of Italy. They invaded Illyria, on the east coast of\r\n      the Adriatic Sea, whose people were very troublesome pirates.\r\n      This war was again renewed with a more complete defeat of the\r\n      Illyrians. They had before this subdued Sardinia and Corsica.\r\n\r\n    219—The Carthaginians pursued their conquests in Spain, and\r\n      the celebrated Hannibal took Saguntum, which\r\n    218—brought on the second Punic war, as the war with Carthage\r\n      was termed.\r\n\r\n    217—Hannibal, with great celerity, crossed the Pyrenees and\r\n      the Alps—having first completed the conquest of Spain—and\r\n      defeated the Romans in the battle of Ticinus, and again at\r\n      Trebia.\r\n\r\n    217—The Achaian confederacy, now in the height of its glory\r\n      in maintaining the liberties of Greece, united all the Greeks\r\n      in a confederacy under the influence of Philip, king of\r\n      Macedon, with the hope of arresting the power and ambition of\r\n      Rome.\r\n\r\n    216—Hannibal inflicted a dreadful defeat on the Romans near\r\n      the Thrasymenean Lake. The Romans were greatly alarmed, and\r\n      made Fabius Maximus dictator, whose habit of refusing a\r\n      pitched battle, wearing out his adversary by skirmishes and\r\n      cutting off his supplies, is called “The Fabian Policy.” This\r\n      plan is, by maneuvering and delay, to wear out and destroy\r\n      an invader in detail without peril of defeat in battle. The\r\n      Romans kept armies in Spain to prevent the Carthaginians from\r\n      sending reinforcements to Hannibal.\r\n\r\n    215—At the close of this year Fabius resigned his\r\n      dictatorship and the consuls appointed to succeed him\r\n      abandoned his policy. They offered battle to Hannibal at\r\n      Cannæ and the army was annihilated. 40,000 Romans were slain\r\n      on the field. These defeats had destroyed the flower of\r\n      their fighting population, but Roman courage and resolution\r\n      always rose with defeat. They did not despair, but raised a\r\n      fresh army and put Fabius again at its head, against whom the\r\n      talents of Hannibal were vain. They fomented disturbances in\r\n      Greece to keep Philip, King of Macedon at home, and besieged\r\n      Syracuse in Sicily, which had joined the Carthaginians,\r\n\r\n    212—for three years, and then took it by stratagem. Archimedes,\r\n      a celebrated mathematician of Syracuse, who had protracted\r\n      the siege by his ingenious and powerful engines was killed in\r\n      the sack of the city. Soon\r\n    210—after the whole island was subdued and remained a Roman\r\n      province.\r\n\r\n    206—Asdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, general of the\r\n      Carthaginian forces in Spain, crossed the Pyrenees and the\r\n      Alps to reinforce Hannibal, but was defeated by the Romans\r\n      and slain before Hannibal knew of his march.\r\n\r\n    202—Scipio, who had conquered in Spain, led an army into\r\n      Africa, Hannibal being considered too formidable to attack,\r\n      though his forces were very small. Scipio put 40,000\r\n      Numidians, allies of Carthage, to the sword, besieged the\r\n      neighboring cities and defeated a large Carthaginian army.\r\n      Hannibal was now called home to defend the metropolis. He\r\n      fought a battle with raw\r\n    201—troops, at Zama, and was defeated—20,000 Carthaginians\r\n      being slain. The Carthaginians begged for peace, Hannibal\r\n      declaring that the war could not be protracted. The Roman\r\n      terms left them little but their city. Such was the fruit of\r\n      inflexible resolution.\r\n\r\n5. The Romans are an example of a people, who, from first to last, had\r\none clearly defined end, to which everything else was subservient. They\r\nformed their state for conquest, and that idea controlled the Kingdom,\r\nthe Republic and the Empire. They were much wiser than the Spartans,\r\nfor, devoting themselves to war, they meant to secure and enjoy all the\r\nfruits of conquest, and they did all that was possible to promote the\r\nprosperity of their people that they might produce warriors in abundance;\r\nbut they relied mainly on actual war for discipline. They were constantly\r\nexercised in the art in the field and the orderly and sensible instinct\r\nof the race made discipline a matter of course. They were sometimes\r\ndefeated when they encountered unfamiliar difficulties, or by the\r\nmistakes of their leaders, but never abandoned a purpose once adopted and\r\nnever sued for peace.\r\n\r\nMorally, the object they set before them was entirely unjustifiable,\r\naccording to the standard of national rights accepted in our day. But\r\nsuch a conception never entered the minds of men in the ancient times. It\r\nis the fruit of modern civilization alone. The Romans, and many a nation\r\nafter them, must work out the destructive consequences of that doctrine\r\nthat “Might makes Right” before the universal sense of mankind would\r\nrecoil from it. It was the accepted doctrine of the ancients, and has not\r\nyet disappeared from the world.\r\n\r\n    197—Sicily, Spain and Carthage were conquered, and Roman\r\n      valor looked around for opportunities of winning fresh\r\n      laurels. Philip of Macedon, an ambitious prince, threatened\r\n      the Athenians, who implored help from Rome. An army\r\n      immediately proceeded to Greece, penetrated into Macedonia,\r\n      and completely defeated Philip at Cynocephalæ.\r\n\r\n6. The Romans were now the mightiest people in the civilized world.\r\nTheir obstinate contests with the vigorous nations of the West had often\r\nperilled the existence of their state, and a people of ordinary stamina\r\nand persistence would not, at the best, have risen above the rank of\r\nthe Etruscans and Samnites, nor have made Rome greater than Syracuse or\r\nCarthage. They, however, matured and grew into an invincible power, whose\r\nsolid and stately grandeur struck the intelligent but unpractical Greeks\r\nwith admiration, and all the old peoples of the East with awe.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were not without admiration for the ancient valor and the\r\ngraceful culture of the Greeks. When, two hundred and fifty years before,\r\nthe Romans revised their laws, under the Decemvirate, they sent to Athens\r\nto obtain models from that republic. Athens was now treated by them with\r\nmuch consideration, and finally became the University City of the Empire.\r\nWhen Roman influence became paramount after the battle of Cynocephalæ\r\nthey did not at once proceed with brutal force against the land of\r\nBeauty and Art, but took it under their protection, and proclaimed\r\nthe full liberty of the Grecian States. It filled the Greeks with\r\ntransport, and for some time Rome played the noble and dignified part of\r\na disinterested protector; but when the Achaians, under their excellent\r\nand talented leader Philopœmen, sought to realize the fact of liberty,\r\nthe Romans abandoned that pretence and made Greece a Roman province.\r\nThus the whole of Europe that was sufficiently civilized to maintain a\r\nsettled government was ruled by the Roman Republic. The period of rude\r\nand restless valor among the Greeks was past. The stage of cultivation\r\nthey had reached inclined them to the quiet and elegant refinements of\r\nthe scholar, and they readily received the Roman rule which suppressed\r\nthe turbulence of ambitious adventurers and suffered no oppression but\r\ntheir own. The Romans represented the strength of the male element in\r\nhuman nature, the Greeks the grace of the female. They now coalesced,\r\nwere married, so to speak, and the product of their union was, in the\r\ncourse of ages, modern civilization, which, when mature, was to share the\r\neminent qualities of both.\r\n\r\n7. The broken fragments of Alexander’s immense empire in Western Asia and\r\nEgypt were all that now stood between Rome and the mastery of the world.\r\nThe Roman people were too well convinced that it was their grand destiny\r\nto achieve universal dominion to hasten prematurely the conquest of the\r\nprimitive home of civilization. They watchfully waited until the course\r\nof events should throw the dominions of the Seleucidæ and the Ptolemys\r\ninto their hands, without offending the majesty of the republic by an\r\nundignified violence and haste.\r\n\r\n    190—Antiochus the Great, who now reigned over the empire of\r\n      the Seleucidæ, with true Grecian imprudence, became ambitious\r\n      of conquests in Europe. He invaded Greece\r\n    191—and was defeated at Thermopylæ by the Romans and driven\r\n      into Asia. The younger Scipio, brother of the conqueror of\r\n      Hannibal, followed and totally defeated\r\n    189—him at Magnesia, in Asia Minor. He purchased peace by\r\n      the loss of all the fruits of his ambition, but was left in\r\n      possession of the Syrian kingdom. The failure to destroy so\r\n      powerful an enemy appears to have brought on the two Scipios\r\n      the rebuke of the republic, the conqueror of Carthage having\r\n      aided his brother in the war. They were condemned to a heavy\r\n      fine, which Scipio Africanus refused to pay and went into\r\n    183—exile, where he died. His death occurred in the same year\r\n      that Hannibal, pursued by the vengeance of the Romans for\r\n      having aided Antiochus, committed suicide by taking poison\r\n      to avoid falling into their hands; and in this year also\r\n      Philopœmen, the last patriotic hero\r\n    170—of Greece, was slain by his enemies. Perses, king of\r\n      Macedon, revolted, and, after some successes, was finally\r\n      overthrown under the walls of Pydna and dethroned.\r\n\r\n    168—The Carthaginians could not altogether forget their\r\n      ancient greatness, and having displeased the Romans by some\r\n      independence of action, it was resolved to\r\n    148—destroy their city. With the courage of despair they\r\n      set the Romans at defiance, and defended themselves with\r\n      a resolute bravery that engaged the lively sympathies of\r\n      all after times for their painful fate. For two years they\r\n      maintained the combat against their pitiless foes, who could\r\n      pardon everything but rivalry in their\r\n    146—sweeping ambition, and then perished in the ruins of\r\n      their once glorious metropolis. A revolt of the Achaians\r\n      was punished, in the same year, by the destruction of the\r\n      splendid city of Corinth, in Greece.\r\n\r\n    140—The embers of independence in Spain broke forth in war,\r\n      which was checked by the assassination of Viriathes, a\r\n      patriotic chieftain of great ability, and\r\n    133—quenched in blood by the self-destruction of the citizens\r\n      of Numantium. About the same time the republic acquired the\r\n      kingdom of Pergamus, covering the richest parts of Asia\r\n      Minor, by the will of Attalus, its king, who, on his death,\r\n      bequeathed it to Rome. This led, in a few years, to contests\r\n      with the neighboring Asiatic sovereigns, and resulted, in\r\n      about half a century, in the conquest and reduction into the\r\n      state of Roman provinces of all Western Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nDECAY OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n1. But while Rome was thus steadily advancing to universal dominion,\r\ngreat and unfortunate changes were taking place in its internal\r\nconstitution. The spoils of Carthage and the east, rich in accumulations\r\nof the industry, commerce and art of two thousand years, flowed into\r\nRome and was gathered into the hands of those in power; the equilibrium\r\nbetween the plebeans and the patricians was lost; the selling of captives\r\ntaken in war filled Italy with slaves; and the inequality of conditions\r\nproduced the most disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\n    133—The eldest son of a noble house, the Gracchi, undertook\r\n      to stem the torrent that was sweeping away the ancient\r\n      barriers of the constitution, and to raise the people from\r\n      the misery into which the increase of patrician wealth and\r\n      power and the innumerable multitudes of slaves had plunged\r\n      them. In the year in which Numantia fell and Spain was\r\n      thoroughly subdued, Tiberius Gracchus was slain in a tumult,\r\n      produced by the patricians, who determined that his project\r\n      should not succeed. He had attempted to revive the old\r\n      agrarian law, by which the landed possessions of the republic\r\n      were shared among the people as well as the patricians, which\r\n      would have rescued the plebeans from poverty and oppression;\r\n      but the patricians were too powerful and too violent. He was\r\n      removed by assassination.\r\n\r\n    2. 121—Twelve years later his brother, Caius Gracchus,\r\n      attempted the same thing and was likewise slain. This point\r\n      was vital to the internal liberties of Rome. The failure of\r\n      the Gracchi announced the overthrow of the constitution;\r\n      and, after seventy years of civil anarchy and the murderous\r\n      conflict of rival factions, the empire was found the only\r\n      refuge against the ruin of the state. Vigorous Rome, who\r\n      could govern all the world but herself, must have a master,\r\n      and became the prey of the strongest. It is a melancholy\r\n      history, a sad conclusion for a people whose strength and\r\n      grandeur of character had made them masters of the world, but\r\n      a perfectly legitimate result of the immoral principle that\r\n      lay at the foundation of the state. That principle legalized\r\n      the doctrine of force, or robbery on the grandest scale. They\r\n      carried it out with great consistency and skill, with all\r\n      the ability of a race eminently sagacious and steady in the\r\n      pursuit of an end. The conservative force that dwelt in their\r\n      organization, so instinctively and exceptionally wise, and\r\n      the power of religious faith, strong in a hardy and simple\r\n      people, however weakened by pagan ignorance and superstition,\r\n      long maintained the integrity of their institutions—but\r\n      Greek culture, too imperfect not to culminate in skepticism,\r\n      came in to confuse their moral sense at the same time that\r\n      boundless wealth flowed into their hands to corrupt their\r\n      manners, that slavery assumed gigantic proportions to\r\n      demoralize labor, and the conquest of the world relieved them\r\n      from the severe discipline that might not, otherwise, have\r\n      left them the leisure to become deeply vicious.\r\n\r\n      The sternness of even Roman character was unequal to the\r\n      heavy strain and virtue gave way. The native vigor of the\r\n      race made them as excessive in unrestrained passion as wise\r\n      in council and invincible in war. The cruelty and rapacity\r\n      that were common in the civil wars of the Republic, and\r\n      under many of the early emperors, educated giants in crime,\r\n      and only the Roman spirit in the army, and the vigorous\r\n      organization everywhere maintained through the institutions\r\n      established in the subject world by Roman law, could have\r\n      held its vast dominions together. Rome had vitality and sense\r\n      to govern others, even in the midst of civil war.\r\n\r\n    3. From the death of the Gracchi to the consulship\r\n    107—Of Marius, Rome was in a tumult of corrupt intrigue,\r\n      which rendered easy the usurpation and inhuman cruelty of\r\n      Jugurtha, king of Numidia. Marius, a plebian of the lowest\r\n      rank, became consul. He was unequaled at once as a general\r\n      and a tyrant. He conquered\r\n    106—Jugurtha, who was brought to Rome and starved in prison.\r\n      In the same year Cicero, the great Roman orator, was born.\r\n\r\n      A vast horde of Cimbri and Teutons from northern\r\n    105—Europe, invaded Gaul and defeated several Roman consuls.\r\n\r\n    100—Marius led an army against these barbarians and defeated\r\n      them, more than 100,000 being slain or made prisoners. He was\r\n      equally successful in a second engagement. During the war\r\n      200,000 barbarians were slain and 90,000 taken prisoners. A\r\n      revolt of the slaves was put down about the same time with\r\n      circumstances of extreme cruelty. More than a million of\r\n      these unfortunates were slain or thrown to wild beasts for\r\n      the amusement of the Roman populace.\r\n\r\n    4. 100—In this year Julius Cæsar, one of the greatest men of\r\n      any time, and virtual founder of the Roman Empire, was born.\r\n      His supreme ability put an end to civil dissention and saved\r\n      society from total ruin.\r\n\r\n    90—The Italian allies revolted against Rome. They claimed the\r\n      privileges of Roman citizenship, which the Senate refused.\r\n      A war of three years followed and half a million of men\r\n      perished, when, having conquered them, the Senate granted\r\n      their first request.\r\n\r\n    88—Mithridates, king of Pontus, talented and ambitious,\r\n      sought to drive the Romans out of Asia and Greece, and\r\n      warred with them for twenty-five years. Sylla procured the\r\n      banishment of his rival, Marius, and conducted the war\r\n      against Mithridates.\r\n\r\n    86—Marius regained power in the absence of Sylla and\r\n      slaughtered his enemies, the patricians, without mercy, but\r\n      soon after died.\r\n\r\n    83—Sylla, after obliging Mithridates to sue for peace,\r\n      hastened to Rome, conquered his enemies, and slew more than\r\n      6,000 Roman citizens in revenge.\r\n\r\n    81—Sylla caused himself to be made perpetual dictator\r\n    77—But after three years resigned and soon after died\r\n      from the effects of his vices. Civil war was continued for\r\n      a time in Spain and Italy, but finally put down by Pompey,\r\n    70—the greatest general of the patrician party.\r\n\r\n      The war of the gladiators—men trained to fight in the\r\n      theatres for the amusement of the populace—broke out under\r\n      an able leader, Spartacus, who, collecting an army of\r\n      120,000 gladiators, endangered Rome itself, but\r\n    70—he was conquered by Crassus. Spartacus was defeated and\r\n      killed. It was the inhuman oppression of the patricians that\r\n      produced all these dreadful conflicts.\r\n\r\n    65—Pompey and Crassus, by paying court to the people,\r\n      were made consuls. Pompey proceeded to Asia and made war\r\n      on Mithridates, who was again formidable,\r\n    63—whom he defeated and slew in battle. He subdued nearly all\r\n      western Asia, visiting Jerusalem, and treating the Jews with\r\n      kindness. He also cleared the Mediterranean of pirates, who\r\n      had always infested it.\r\n\r\n    62—A dangerous conspiracy of Cataline, a patrician of the\r\n      most corrupt morals, at the head of the depraved young\r\n      nobility of the time, would have been successful but for the\r\n      ability and eloquence of Cicero, who was consul. Cataline and\r\n      his fellow conspirators were taken and slain.\r\n\r\n    59—Cæsar, Pompey, and Crassus formed the first “Triumvirate,”\r\n      and divided the rule of the world between them. Cæsar was\r\n      the head of the popular party. He\r\n    57—took Gaul as his government. Here he spent eight years\r\n      in his “Gallic wars,” showing unparalleled talents as a\r\n      general, training his army to become invincible in battle,\r\n      and completely subduing the fierce Gauls. He\r\n    55—entered Britain and laid the foundation of civilization\r\n      there, thus carrying the march of empire to its farthest\r\n      bounds in Europe.\r\n\r\n    5. 49—He was ordered to return and lay down his authority by\r\n      the Roman Senate, headed by Pompey, who was now his enemy.\r\n      They were the rival champions of the two parties in the\r\n      state, the people and the patricians, whose quarrels had so\r\n      long filled Rome with tumult and slaughter. The tribunes\r\n      in Cæsar’s interest interposed a veto, which the Roman\r\n      Constitution authorized them to do. The Senate voted to\r\n      suspend the Constitution, which really terminated the Roman\r\n      Republic, Jan. 7, B. C. 49. Cæsar at once crossed the river\r\n      Rubicon, the boundary of his government, and marched his army\r\n      on Rome. Pompey and the aristocratic party fled in haste,\r\n      leaving the public treasure behind. In sixty days Cæsar had\r\n      possession of all Italy. Sicily, Sardinia, and Spain were\r\n      next conquered from the officers of Pompey, when he returned\r\n      to Rome, and was created dictator by his party. He treated\r\n      all his enemies with clemency. Pompey had gone into Greece,\r\n    48—where he gathered a large army. Cæsar followed with\r\n      his veteran legions, and defeated him in the battle of\r\n      Pharsalia in Thessaly. Pompey fled to Egypt, where he was\r\n      treacherously slain, to the great indignation of Cæsar, who\r\n      would shed no blood but in necessary battle. Thus he became\r\n      sole master of the world.\r\n\r\n      In a conflict with the Egyptians in Alexandria Cæsar set on\r\n      fire their fleet, he being attended by but few troops, and\r\n      the conflagration extended to the Alexandrian Library, filled\r\n      with inestimable treasures of ancient literature, which\r\n      were destroyed, to the great loss of future generations.\r\n      Cæsar soon subdued Egypt,\r\n    47—defeated Pharnaces, son of Mithridates, and returned to Rome.\r\n\r\n    46—He soon passed into Africa, where he defeated his enemies.\r\n      The celebrated Cato, an inflexible enemy of Cæsar, committed\r\n      suicide rather than submit to him. In Spain he soon after\r\n      defeated the sons of Pompey, the last of his foes in arms.\r\n      He rebuilt Carthage and\r\n    45—Corinth. He projected many great public works and useful\r\n      reforms. The whole power of Roman sovereignty\r\n    44—was formally conferred on him by the people, when he was\r\n      suddenly assassinated by a band of senators and certain\r\n      conspirators, who imagined it possible to restore the ancient\r\n      Republic. His nephew, Augustus, succeeded him soon after.\r\n\r\n    43—The eminent Cicero, never a friend to Cæsar, was\r\n      assassinated by the connivance of Augustus.\r\n\r\n    42—The republican and aristocratic conspirators were defeated\r\n      by Augustus and Antony at Philippi, in Greece. Brutus and\r\n      Cassius, the republican leaders, and assassins of Cæsar, were\r\n      slain. The second “Triumvirate,” composed of Augustus, Antony\r\n      and Lepidus, having acquired possession of all the powers of\r\n      the state, ruthlessly murdered thousands of their political\r\n      enemies. They soon grew jealous of each other, and fought and\r\n      intrigued for eleven years, Augustus, with great prudence,\r\n      firmly settling himself in Rome, and Antony becoming the\r\n      slave of the beautiful and infamous Cleopatra, queen of Egypt.\r\n\r\n    31—At length, at the battle of Actium, Antony was defeated,\r\n      and soon after both Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide.\r\n      Egypt became formally a Roman province, and Augustus absolute\r\n      emperor of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n1. B. C. 28—In this year Augustus, having fully consolidated his power,\r\nwas formally recognized emperor. During all the contests of factions, and\r\nwhen Rome was itself in the throes of revolution, the subjection of all\r\nthe provinces to the imperial city, and whoever was in power there, was\r\nrigorously maintained. The inhabitants were protected from invasion, and\r\nif they were often oppressed by Roman governors, it was far less than\r\nunder their native rulers, and, in general, they were not desirous of a\r\nchange. Roman law and order, and the power of appeal from great injustice\r\nto the Roman senate or emperor, maintained a state of generally tranquil\r\nprosperity, only disturbed by the contests of rivals for the control of\r\nthe imperial city and its power.\r\n\r\nA long period of almost absolute quiet followed the establishment of\r\nthe empire, which gave Rome and Italy great satisfaction, after nearly\r\na hundred years of civil war. It is called the “Augustan Age,” when\r\nindustry and commerce, literature and the arts, reached their highest\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire and the Christian era commenced nearly together. During\r\nthe thirty years that followed the battle of Actium, which secured to\r\nAugustus the sole control of the civilized world, by the defeat of his\r\nlast rival, Antony, he was occupied in organizing the vast machinery of\r\nhis government, and centralizing all the parts of the administration in\r\nhis own person. For near three hundred years Western Asia and Greece had\r\nbeen a scene of violent commotion. Rival adventurers were constantly\r\nseeking to reconstruct the empire of Alexander. Some of these had the\r\ngenius and the good fortune to succeed, in part at least, and swayed a\r\npowerful scepter over a large region during their own lives, and, in some\r\ninstances, their dominions were held together for several generations.\r\nBut there was no sufficient base for a strong and permanent government.\r\nThere was no stable element on which to rest it. The Greeks were brave,\r\nintelligent and enterprising, and no Asiatic people could withstand a\r\nGreek army under Greek leaders; but the Greeks were too restless, too\r\neasily carried away by enthusiasm for a new leader or a new idea to be\r\ncapable of upholding an empire.\r\n\r\n2. Thus, Asia and Greece had been a vast battle field, and the battles\r\nserved no general interest and founded no permanent state. The Greeks\r\ngrew tired of supporting the claims of each new aspirant, who returned\r\ntheir favor by depriving them of liberty, and the whole eastern world\r\nreadily submitted to the Romans, under whom there was, at least, a\r\nprospect of civil order. Augustus, then, had little trouble in settling\r\nthe affairs of the whole empire, and, about thirty years after the\r\nbattle of Actium, finding the entire world quietly content and the\r\nadministration everywhere in fair working order, directed the gates\r\nof the temple of Janus to be closed, and a census to be made of all\r\nhis subjects. At this time Jesus Christ was born and the Christian era\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire under Augustus was the culmination of the ancient and\r\npagan civilization. It had great vitality, and strength enough to rule\r\nthe world four hundred years longer; but it had also fatal weaknesses. We\r\nhave seen that the existence of the empire originated in the inability\r\nof the old society to free itself from the vices which long and great\r\nprosperity had developed. It had no purifying element strong enough to\r\ndrive out the disease which its moral weakness had allowed to fasten on\r\nit. It was, in fact, based on wrong and could not but perish. Its fall\r\nwas only a question of time. Its ferocious valor and contempt of the\r\nrights of nations broke down the very virtue that was essential to the\r\nstability of society. The Romans were robbers on a grand scale, and it\r\nwas very natural that, when there were no more foreign nations to slay\r\nand plunder, the citizens should fall to cutting each others throats and\r\nrobbing their neighbors. As this would lead to the immediate ruin of\r\nsociety and the state, the empire, which gave them an absolute master,\r\nwas a necessity.\r\n\r\n3. But a full comprehension of the moral laws on which society,\r\ninstitutions and states are founded, was the last to be gained.\r\nMost modern nations have not yet attained it, notwithstanding that\r\nChristianity has so long stated the principles with clearness and force.\r\n\r\nThe common mind of humanity could master them only by growth through\r\nthousands of years and innumerable experiences. The object of all earthly\r\nexperience is to develop the value of the _individual man_; and the\r\nobject of society, of institutions and of government, is to protect the\r\nrights and to favor the development of _each man_ of the race. When\r\nthis end is fully secured, history will have solved its problem. As the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era was the turning point of history in\r\nsome most important respects, it is proper to glance back and forward\r\nover the state of this problem, and the relation of Christianity to it,\r\nbefore proceeding with the general course of events.\r\n\r\nAt first men were like children, with everything to learn; and, like\r\nchildren, they learned one thing at a time; and they also made an\r\naddition to their common stock of knowledge at every remove of the\r\ncentre of growth. In Asia and Egypt the general lesson was industry and\r\nobedience, while the Jews, on the western shore, more or less assisted by\r\nthe Assyrians, the Egyptians and the Greeks, labored at the development\r\nof a pure religion which culminated in Christianity. The removal of the\r\ncentre to Greece added mental and artistic culture, and the further\r\nwestward journey to Rome gave them a new class of most important ideas\r\nconcerning public organization, law and order.\r\n\r\n4. If each of these lessons had been perfect in themselves the addition\r\nmade by Christianity, which defined the relations between men, the law of\r\nhuman rights and the doctrines essential to the stability and purity of\r\nsociety, would have enabled mankind to build up satisfactory institutions\r\nand a complete civilization from the Roman period. But the elementary\r\nlessons were very incomplete. The Asiatics became very superstitious;\r\nthe Greeks could teach men the _art_ of thinking, or exercising their\r\nminds, but they could not find the true starting point; they did not\r\ndiscover what subjects it was useful, and what it was useless, to reason\r\nupon; and wasted a good part of the thought of their times on profitless\r\nquestions. Their failure to obtain a clear and valuable result from\r\nphilosophy made men skeptical and contributed much to the decline of\r\ncivilization in the time of the Roman empire. The Romans built their\r\nwhole structure of law and order on _force_ and a wholesale violation\r\nof the rights of mankind, and the minds of men became greatly confused.\r\nThe doctrine of the Epicurean philosophers—“Let us eat and drink for\r\nto-morrow we die”—a despair of working out the problem of life to a\r\nsatisfactory answer, became the most popular in the empire. The splendor\r\nand glory of Oriental, Grecian and Roman civilization seemed to end\r\nin degrading servility and superstition, in the endless and absurd\r\nspeculations of so-called philosophers, and in the vast brutal tyranny\r\nof the emperors. The east failed of a pure religion that was generally\r\naccepted. Greek philosophy did not have science to guide her thought, and\r\nRome could not be just as well as strong.\r\n\r\n5. It was only in modern times that these lessons were made complete.\r\nThe discoveries in Geography, in Astronomy, in Natural Philosophy, in\r\nChemistry, in Geology, made men acquainted with the structure of the\r\nuniverse, the properties and the laws of matter, and corrected the\r\nextravagances of the ancient speculative philosophy. For want of science,\r\nGreek thought wandered about in an unreal world and lost a good part of\r\nits labor. A long experience under the control of this, corrected thought\r\nwas required to construct a science of Government that should supply what\r\nwas wanting to Roman jurisprudence, and Christianity itself could not\r\nbe rightly understood while so many false theories and wrong practices\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nBut the ancient times were as essential to the building up of the modern\r\nas the modern to the completion of the ancient. It was the renewed\r\nstudy of the Greek classics, of Roman law, and of the original teachings\r\nof Christianity, under more favorable circumstances, and after many\r\nnew experiences for a thousand years, that gave birth to all our later\r\nimprovements in religion, in government and in science. The Asiatic Jews\r\ngave us in Christianity, a pure and simple worship, and a system of\r\npublic morality so perfect that no society has yet been able to embody it\r\ncompletely in practice, although it is now recognized, very generally, as\r\nthe highest conceivable standard, to be constantly aimed at and conformed\r\nto as far as possible; the Greek Philosopher, Aristotle, gave us the\r\nfirst notions of science, and Roman law formed the base of modern legal\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n6. The difficulties of progress are very great. It is not easier for\r\nnations to unlearn what they have learned amiss in their youth, than\r\nfor individuals. No nation that has matured institutions has ever yet\r\nthoroughly reformed them. The best and most clear sighted minds discover\r\ntheir defects and show what is to be remedied; but the force of habit\r\nand the veneration men feel for what is old, offer so much resistance\r\nto complete reforms that it has been necessary to establish and build\r\nup institutions on new principles on fresh ground. So all the light and\r\npower of science, of the reformed religion, of a more complete system of\r\nlaw, the greater intelligence of the masses of men and the activity of\r\ncommerce and trade did not suffice to do for modern Europe what has been\r\ndone with ease in America. But Europe furnished the ideas which America\r\nworked out; and the sight of those principles embodied in institutions\r\nthat greatly improved the condition of mankind has reacted on Europe, and\r\nbids fair, in time, to produce a novelty in human experience—a complete\r\nregeneration of old nations and governments. When Greece rose to power it\r\nsubjected but lightly, and only superficially transformed, the nations\r\nof Asia; Rome absorbed them both, and Christianity gave its simple and\r\nnoble lessons to them all. But the slight influence of Greece, Rome\r\nand Christianity on the old nations of western Asia is shown in the\r\nrise and permanence of Mohammedanism, so inferior, in all respects, to\r\nChristianity. After a career of more than twelve hundred years, it still\r\nrules many more millions than were contained in all the Roman Empire in\r\nits most prosperous days.\r\n\r\n7. But the power of a progressive civilization constantly increases, and\r\nwill, by and by, be equal to the thorough reform of even crystalized\r\nChina. Without America, Europe would be still struggling with the\r\nincipient stages of reform. With it, she has gone far toward correcting\r\nthe imperfections which existed one hundred years ago, and will presently\r\ncomplete the process. With these general observations, we proceed to\r\nexamine the influence of Christianity on the old civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY.\r\n\r\n1. It was developed on the western borders of Asia, and was the\r\ncompletion or perfect development of the system of religion existing\r\namong the Jews from a very early period. Soon after Abraham, the father\r\nand grand patriarch of the Jews, had given his descendants the outlines\r\nof the system, they were led, by circumstances, to Egypt, and remained\r\nthere for many generations. When they left Egypt, it was under the\r\nleadership of one of the greatest of the world’s great men, who had been\r\nheir apparent of the Egyptian throne, and was consequently versed in all\r\nthe mysterious wisdom of the priesthood of that country. That he became\r\nwiser than they is evident from the history of his contest with them\r\nbefore the king when endeavoring to gain his consent to the migration of\r\nhis people from the country. Instructed in all the celebrated “wisdom\r\nof the Egyptians,” together with the reflections and additions of forty\r\nsolitary years as a shepherd in Arabia, he produced a remarkable system\r\nof mingled theology and legislation which has come down as a sacred\r\nrecord to our day.\r\n\r\n2. The Jews were, nine hundred years afterwards, transported as a nation\r\nto Babylon, remained there for more than two generations, and received\r\nsuch light as the Babylonian priests and Persian magi were able to give\r\nthem. The conquest of Asia by the Greeks and the vicinity of Judea to\r\ncommercial Tyre, furnished them all the aid these nations could give in\r\nthe line of religious suggestion. A Jew produced, in the early days of\r\nthe Roman Empire, the simple, yet sublime teachings of Christianity. It\r\nhad the comprehensiveness and directness requisite to give it authority\r\nas a universal religion. In few, but plain and convincing words, it laid\r\ndown the principles of human rights and of divine law. It defined the\r\nnature and stated the sanctions of virtue in the clearest terms; tore\r\naway every covering from vice and denounced without fear the favorite\r\nambitions and follies of men. It seems almost incredible that such a\r\nsystem should have had its origin even among a people like the Jews, and\r\nat the time when the Roman Empire represented the highest civilization of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n3. The Jews, as a nation, however, rejected and bitterly persecuted it,\r\nand the Romans, who were, on principle, extremely tolerant of all foreign\r\nreligions, soon became extremely hostile. It was humble, unostentatious,\r\nvery simple in all its forms, carefully refrained from all interference\r\nwith established government, and presented many new and consoling truths,\r\nwith great force. It would have seemed that it had only to speak to gain\r\na hearing and take a leading place at once in the work of the future. The\r\nfew unprejudiced among the great, and thousands of the poor and oppressed\r\nwhom the cruel power of the Romans had deprived of nationality, property\r\nand personal liberty, and many whose minds recoiled from the vices,\r\ncrimes and skepticism of the age, heard and embraced it with joy. But it\r\nrebuked with most severity the ambitions, the injustice and the love of\r\nluxury that were most prevalent in that age and that were most distinctly\r\nRoman. It was peculiarly severe against all other systems of religion,\r\nand that formed the strongest barrier against its immediate spread over\r\nthe pagan world at large. It was, therefore, persecuted with the greatest\r\nrigor for three hundred years.\r\n\r\n4. But persecution called public attention to it and won it sympathy,\r\nand it continually spread beneath the surface of society. The brutal\r\nfeatures of Roman character were gradually softened; very gradually,\r\nindeed, for Roman manners and morals were an Augean stable which it was\r\na more than herculean task to cleanse; but after a time, the gigantic\r\ncrimes of a Marius, a Sylla, a Nero, or Domitian became impossible, and\r\nthe horrors of the theatre, where gladiators killed each other and men\r\nwere thrown to wild beasts for the amusement of the populace, became\r\nrare. Atrocious crimes awakened a disgust that showed a different view\r\nand a new standard of judgment in the community. Christianity created a\r\npurer moral atmosphere even in Rome, and while it was persecuted with the\r\nutmost barbarity.\r\n\r\n5. It is then no matter of surprise that Christianity did not at once\r\nmeet with general acceptance, and did not fully reconstruct Roman society\r\nand manners. The marvel is that it could be produced at all by an age to\r\nwhose whole spirit it was so absolutely contrary. It was the doctrine of\r\npeace proclaimed among nations who knew no occupation so glorious as war;\r\nwhose institutions all rested on conquest; whose dominant race—admired\r\nas much as feared—was the very genius and embodiment of martial force\r\narrayed against the independence of all nationalities by an organization\r\nthe most complete. It proclaimed the _rights_ of _man_ and the equality\r\nof all classes and persons before the Divine Law, to a people who had\r\nplunged in a common ruin Carthage and Corinth, the Republics of Greece,\r\nand the absolute rulers of monarchical Asia. It scorned equally gorgeous\r\nceremonies of worship, the subtleties of an imperfect philosophy and\r\npride of place and power.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to imagine a greater contrast to all the modes of\r\nhabit and thought prevalent in those times. The most sensual of all\r\nraces it exhorted to spirituality, to the most cruel and insolent it\r\npreached meekness and forbearance. It placed the slave to whom the\r\nrecognized laws of war left no rights, beside the master who gloried in\r\nsetting his foot on the neck of the prostrate; and recognized as equals\r\nthe great and the small, the ignorant and the wise, the bond and the free.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be surprised that it did not obtain immediate currency, that\r\nit was everywhere scorned and cast out, that it aroused unheard of\r\npersecutions, and that it could only obtain, a triumph when the old Roman\r\ninflexibility and fierceness had died out of its degenerate children, and\r\nthe spirit of the ancient world was burned out in the hot fires of its\r\nown passions. Character does not change in a day, and the ruling impulses\r\nof a race can be modified only by slow degrees. Such is the supreme law\r\nwhich has ruled all history.\r\n\r\n6. From all these causes Christianity was slow in penetrating society\r\nand moulding institutions; but it spread so extensively that a clear\r\nsighted emperor at length found it politic to profess Christianity in\r\norder to gain the support of so large and vigorous an element against\r\nhis rivals in power. Constantine was victorious and proceeded to make\r\nChristianity the state religion. It had maintained its growth by its real\r\nsuperiority and ever after remained the most powerful and productive\r\namong the influences that aided the progress of mankind. It was actively\r\naggressive and had made the barbarians who overthrew Rome converts to\r\nthe faith before the invasion, and thus broke the force and diminished\r\nthe disastrous effects of that event. In after times, no sooner did\r\na barbarian tribe appear and establish itself in any part of the old\r\nempire than Christianity commenced the work of teaching and proselyting,\r\nwhich aided much in restoring order and repairing ruin. Had Christianity\r\npreserved its purity its usefulness and power would have been much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n7. But as it gained in numbers and in position it lost internal strength.\r\nBoth Oriental and Greek philosophy tainted its simple doctrines and\r\nintroduced in various forms the hurtful speculations so dear to the\r\nancients; and when it became the court religion the simplicity of its\r\nceremonies was gradually replaced by the pomp and splendor of pagan\r\nworship. Constantine and his successors in the empire assumed the virtual\r\nheadship of the church, called councils and packed them for political\r\npurposes, and pronounced for or against supposed heresies. The offices of\r\nthe church became the rewards of ambition and gradually a hierarchy, or\r\nregular gradation, was established in the priesthood, and both faith and\r\nmanners came to be strangely in contrast with their original simplicity.\r\nYet, Christianity, aping the forms and infected with the superstitions\r\nof paganism, and become the tool of the aspiring, was still alive with a\r\nyouthful vigor by which she eased the fall of the old civilization, and\r\nwas abundant in valuable service for the civilization yet to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SERVICES OF GREAT MEN TO MANKIND.\r\n\r\n1. It is difficult for us to comprehend the embarrassments which a want\r\nof diffused information presented to the progress of the ancient days.\r\nWith no books, or, at best, but very few, with little or no record of\r\nthe past, or the distant present, but what confused, distorted and\r\nuncertain tradition and rumor could give, with almost no _instruments_\r\nof thought and education, it would seem natural that they should fall\r\ninto a hopeless barbarism. That they raised themselves so far out of a\r\ncondition so low and so helpless, that they created so many instruments\r\nfor _us_, is a proof of the wonderful capacity for advancement that lies\r\nin humanity, and a prophecy of stupendous things yet in store for mankind.\r\n\r\n2. One of the most important elements of their progress lay in their\r\n_great men_. It is indispensable that a man, to become great, or famous,\r\nby exercising a wide influence, should represent in a large, well defined\r\nand successful way, the general tendency and aspiration of his times. He\r\nmust unite a clear perception of these tendencies in his mind, with the\r\npower to give them adequate expression in his words or deeds. He must be\r\nso far ahead of his times as to be able to clearly work out what is lying\r\nunexpressed in the general mind, but not so far ahead that it cannot come\r\ninto sympathy and co-operation with him; else he will not be recognized\r\nas great. Great men are a summary of their times, or of the people they\r\ndwell among; they gather its tendencies to a point and express the\r\nundefined desire of that period. Their value for later times is that\r\nthey represent the spirit of their race at that time in a form to make a\r\nstriking impression, and those who have the good fortune to represent the\r\nqualities of the best races, or of nations at the most important stage\r\nof their history, become the general exemplars of mankind; teaching in a\r\nforcible and striking way the lessons which have been wrought out in the\r\nexperience of a whole people for ages.\r\n\r\n3. The poets are the first of these great men of whom history gives us\r\nany account, except, perhaps, the heroes whose deeds they sung, which\r\nare more or less uncertain, because they clothed the common tradition of\r\ntheir times in an imaginative and fictitious dress. The poets Homer and\r\nHesiod had great influence on early Greece. They summed up its theology\r\nand the history of its admired heroes, and gave expression to the early\r\nthought and literary turn of that people.\r\n\r\nTheir legislators came next. They gave expression to the genius of their\r\npeople in institutions and laws. Lycurgus arranged the Spartan state into\r\na military school. His laws remained in force more than five hundred\r\nyears. Solon was the legislator of Athens and his laws were much admired\r\nfor their wisdom and justice. The Greeks could think more wisely than\r\nthey could act. Lycurgus organized the warlike spirit in Greece as well\r\nas Sparta. The small Grecian states, determined to keep Sparta and each\r\none of the other states from destroying their individual liberties, were\r\ntrained by the necessity of combating the vigorous military organization\r\nof Sparta to great ability in war.\r\n\r\nUnder Pericles, a republican statesman of Athens, nearly a century\r\nlater than Solon, the full glory of the Grecian genius shone forth. He\r\nencouraged his countrymen to give the support to art and literature that\r\nproduced the famous master pieces which have made Greece illustrious and\r\ninfluential to this day.\r\n\r\n4. Socrates appeared soon after. He was the apostle of thought. His\r\ninfluence in leading men to use direct and effective modes of examination\r\nand reasoning was incalculable, and has perhaps had more effect on the\r\nworld than the victorious career of Alexander or of the Romans. He was\r\nfollowed by Plato, a disciple of his, who pushed out to further results\r\nthe same principles. He is called the prince of philosophers, and has\r\nexerted a world-wide influence. He had not the simplicity and plain\r\ndirectness of Socrates, though his mind was more polished, and he was\r\nmore learned. Some scholars, however, consider his masterpieces to\r\nindicate as powerful a mind as the world has produced. He spent twelve\r\nyears in travel, and used all the means of education, and study then\r\nto be found. His works are still the delight of the most accomplished\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n5. Aristotle began his career in the last years of Plato. He was the\r\ntutor of Alexander the Great. He followed a different line of study,\r\nwrote on logic, or the art of reasoning, on the natural sciences, and\r\nintroduced method in the exercise of the mind and in study. Herodotus,\r\nXenophon, Thucydides, and many other great writers, artists and\r\nsculptors, lived about the same period; and thus Grecians did for the\r\nmind what the Romans did for law and government—laid down the fundamental\r\nprinciples which formed the basis of real progress.\r\n\r\nThe free government of Athens encouraged oratory and the art of\r\npersuasion. Demosthenes was the most celebrated orator among the Greeks,\r\nand if his state had only been more powerful he would have conquered\r\nPhilip of Macedon. He was indeed one of the greatest orators of all\r\ntimes. Cicero, among the Romans, was a writer and orator of almost equal\r\nmerit. They both lived just at the downfall of the liberties of their\r\nstates, and they spoke with more effect to the times after them than to\r\ntheir contemporaries. If they did not succeed in preserving the liberties\r\nof Greece and Rome, they made a great impression, the name of Liberty\r\nwas consecrated by their noble words, and those who destroyed it made\r\ninfamous by their burning invectives. When a more favorable time came for\r\nrestoring it, they lived again in influence, and triumphed by the memory\r\nand record of their great patriotism and powerful eloquence.\r\n\r\n6. Great conquerors and warriors, in all times, have also been\r\nrepresentative men, giving expression and gratification to the warlike\r\nspirit of their people, and producing great changes that have been\r\nfavorable to the real advancement of mankind. The energies they stirred\r\nup, and the mingling of nations they produced generally promoted\r\ncivilization. Alexander the Great displayed the wonderful genius and\r\nfertility in resources that was peculiarly Greek. His nation was almost\r\nconsoled for the loss of their liberties by the conquests to which he led\r\nthem. He opened to their study unknown regions, and gave their mental\r\ngenius a broader play and a fuller occupation. They, to such an extent\r\nas change was possible with old civilizations, _Hellenized_ the East and\r\nprepared the way for the reception of Christianity. Alexander, in three\r\ngreat battles, conquered the great Persian Empire with a small army. He\r\nnever suffered defeat, and died at thirty-three years of age. Had he\r\nlived, he might have done what Hannibal could not do—have crushed the\r\nrising power of the Roman republic. It would have been a misfortune, for\r\nthe Romans did incalculable service to humanity. Greek learning exerted\r\nits influence on the East for two hundred and fifty years before its\r\nfinal conquest by the Romans. Alexander did great service to mankind\r\nby his military success. Hannibal is an instance of a great man not as\r\nfully representative of his own people, perhaps, and whose misfortune\r\nit was to have to struggle against a people whose united genius was\r\ngreater, more inventive, and more patient than his own. The Roman Pompey\r\nrepresented the aristocratic element of his people, and though a great\r\ngeneral, hardly deserved to succeed. Julius Cæsar possessed the merciful\r\ncharacter and intelligence of the Greek and the prodigious energy and\r\nresolution of the Roman. His conquest of Gaul and Britain introduced\r\ncivilization into the lands that were, five hundred years later, to begin\r\na new career for mankind. His thorough subjection of the Gauls preserved\r\nthe ancient civilization from the inroads of the vigorous Germans until\r\nall was ready for the new order of things. More than any other great man,\r\nhe may be said to have been representative of the best spirit of his\r\ntime. Perceiving that the Roman republic was dead, and could not possibly\r\nbe restored, from the strength of the vices ruling in the state, he\r\nrepressed its anarchy and set aside its forms, wisely and prudently, with\r\nas little bloodshed or cruelty us possible. He thoroughly represented the\r\npractical sense and immense vigor of the true Roman. He has been severely\r\nreproached for destroying the republic, but the republic virtually\r\nfell with the Gracchi, seventy-five years before, and he established\r\nthe only government that could possibly preserve the Roman state from\r\ndisorganization.\r\n\r\n7. The office of all these, and multitudes of other great men,\r\nless representative of the greater qualities of their fellows, or\r\nrepresentative of less striking features of their times, has been to sum\r\nup the character of their people, and present their special features,\r\n_condensed_, for the observation of mankind, and by their position as\r\nleaders, to give their times an opportunity for powerful development,\r\nas well as to show what mankind are capable of. In this last view\r\nthey stimulate individuals to aspiration and effort. Millions of men,\r\nprobably, have had the qualities of Alexander and Cæsar, millions more\r\nthose of Demosthenes and Cicero, of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle,\r\nand so of all the different classes of great men, but have wanted the\r\nopportunities and peculiar stimulants to develop them. Whoever can\r\nappreciate them, can, with a favorable balance of faculties to give\r\nequally sound judgment, together with equally favorable circumstances,\r\nimitate them. Modern times have shown multitudes of men who, their\r\ncharacter and talents taken as a whole, have shown themselves far greater\r\nthan any of the ancients. Culture and the mingling of races will,\r\nperhaps, finally make _all_ men greater than the greatest of the ancients.\r\n\r\n8. Brutus, one of the murderers of Cæsar, wished to restore the glories\r\nof the ancient Roman republic, and thought Cæsar stood in the way. He\r\nremoved him by violence, and found the difficulties greater than ever.\r\nA hundred years of conquest had sapped the virtues of the Roman people,\r\nand Brutus killed himself in despair, saying: “O Virtue! thou art but a\r\nname!” To Cæsar succeeded Augustus, by a necessity of things. Without\r\nCæsar’s clemency, he deluged Rome with the blood of its citizens.\r\nAfterward, however, his rule was less sanguinary, and for thirty years he\r\nruled with mildness, though with despotism. The limited amount of virtue\r\nin pagan civilizations wore out; and notwithstanding the intelligence\r\nof Greece and the good sense of Rome, the ancient world was obliged to\r\nclose its career as it began, by absolute monarchy. It remained for the\r\nmodern world to find, among its more abundant resources, the means of\r\nforever preserving itself from decline. Education and purity, science and\r\nreligion, freedom and fraternity among all races and nations; a knowledge\r\nand wisdom not conceived by the ancients, a replacing of war and\r\nviolence, which are essentially demoralizing, by peaceful means, which\r\nshall benefit all and injure none; perfectly free intercourse under the\r\nguidance of absolute justice and benevolence; such is the way by which\r\nthe modern world will work out the problem impossible for the old world\r\nto solve. America has gone far toward the goal. In time, all nations will\r\nbe persuaded to join her in attaining it.\r\n\r\n9. Before we proceed with the chronology of the Christian Era we must\r\nbriefly notice the _one perfect man_, Jesus Christ. To pronounce on\r\nthe miraculous and divine claims made for his character and deeds would\r\ncarry us outside of our theme. We can only deal with him as with other\r\nhistorical men, in his historical character and relations. These are\r\nextremely remarkable.\r\n\r\nThat individual sprang, like Socrates, from the poorer classes, and,\r\nlike him without the advantages of education, produced a system which\r\nproved a marvel of perfection, adapted to all times, but most perfectly\r\nto the most perfect state of mankind, and consequently growing up with\r\nthe progress of nations to an ever-increasing influence. Its moral\r\nprecepts, even in our day, are as far ahead of our civilization as that\r\nis behind a perfect condition. This man made an extraordinary impression.\r\nIn three hundred years, by merely publishing his ideas in a quiet way,\r\nwhich was the only mode the hostility of the Roman rulers would permit,\r\nhis followers overthrew the prevailing religious systems which had been\r\nestablished as many thousand years, and spread his influence world-wide.\r\n\r\nHis birth became the commencement of the Era of Humanity. Like Socrates,\r\nhe went about among the people with a few chosen friends, setting forth\r\nhis ideas, chiefly in conversation. He did not write; the simple record\r\nof his life and a few of his discourses being recorded by his disciples.\r\nAgain, like Socrates, his life was ended by violence. All the records\r\nof that life show that he was as perfect as we can conceive. In no\r\nrespect does he seem to have wanted any feature of a noble manhood, in\r\nany degree, nor to have shared the prejudices or defects of his age. He\r\nlived as we may conceive man to live when his mental and moral habits are\r\naccurately adjusted and harmonized with his relations and his duties,\r\nwhich he has learned perfectly to appreciate. His public career lasted\r\nbut three years and a half, and shines in history a beam of light.\r\nHe inspired his appreciative followers with rapturous admiration, a\r\npassionate attachment to his person, and pleasure in obedience to his\r\nteachings, stronger than death; and in those whose plans and prejudices\r\nhe crossed, and whose ambitions he rebuked, a deadly hatred which could\r\nonly be satisfied with his blood.\r\n\r\n10. Immediately after his death his followers commenced to publish\r\nand enforce his teachings with great success, and on the outbreak of\r\npersecution, without making opposition, they scattered in all directions,\r\nproclaiming them with undiminished zeal. Very soon their converts\r\nnumbered tens of thousands, in all parts of the Roman Empire. Persecution\r\nincreased their fervor and their numbers, without leading them to\r\nrevolt or resistance, until, in the course of time, an emperor found it\r\npolitic to profess Christianity. This high patronage, and the active\r\npart the emperors took in the affairs of the church from that time,\r\nhad the effect to corrupt its simplicity of manners, as the adhesion\r\nof Greek philosophers, who imported into its doctrines their crude\r\ntheories, adulterated its teachings, and much that was quite foreign to\r\nits essential character continued associated with its promulgation and\r\ninstitutions for fifteen hundred years, and, indeed, remnants of the same\r\nforeign element yet linger in it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the embarrassing load which the fantastic distortion of\r\nits original simplicity and directness laid upon it, it continued to\r\nexert great influence, and seems destined to return, in time, to its\r\noriginal form and purity, and to employ its primitive power to crown the\r\nwork of civilization.\r\n\r\n11. Such is the historical report of the man who introduced into the\r\nprocess of human progress an element of unexampled power. An impartial\r\nestimate of the influence of Jesus Christ on history must allow that\r\nhe is the most important character that has ever appeared among men.\r\nThe unhappy association of his ideas with the vagaries of an imperfect\r\nphilosophy and the unwholesome ambitions of power, greatly curtailed\r\ntheir usefulness; but the simple majesty of his character and his\r\ndiscourses could not always be obscured, and the luster of both has never\r\nshone more clearly nor exerted more influence than they do in this age.\r\n\r\nThe course of the history of Christianity will be seen to be intimately\r\nconnected with every stage of advancement from the time the Roman Empire\r\nbegan to wear out; it was the nucleus which survived its fall, around\r\nwhich the surging waves of invasion raged in vain, and which immediately\r\nbegan the work of reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTIAN ERA.\r\n\r\n    4—By some chronological confusion the new era has been made\r\n      to begin four years before the appearance of the founder of\r\n      Christianity. When Augustus had settled the whole empire he\r\n      ordered the temple of Janus to be closed and a census taken\r\n      of all its inhabitants, which numbered one hundred and twenty\r\n      millions. On this occasion Jesus Christ was born.\r\n\r\n    10—A Roman army under Varus was defeated and cut to pieces in\r\n      Germany. It was the severest defeat the Romans had suffered\r\n      since the overthrow and death of Crassus, by the Parthians,\r\n      sixty-three years before.\r\n\r\n    14—The Emperor Augustus died and was succeeded by his\r\n      step-son, Tiberius.\r\n\r\n    29—Jesus Christ was crucified by Pontius Pilate, Roman\r\n      governor of Judea, at the solicitation, and on the\r\n      accusation, of the leading Jews.\r\n\r\n    37—Tiberius died and was succeeded by Caligula. The\r\n      commencement of the reign of Tiberius was wise and moderate,\r\n      but he soon became violent and cruel. Caligula was a still\r\n      greater monster of wickedness.\r\n\r\n    40—Growing weary of his cruelty he was assassinated by one\r\n      of his officers, and his uncle, Claudius, was raised to the\r\n      throne. He was of feeble intellect and became the tool of\r\n      infamous favorites. He was poisoned by order of his wife,\r\n      Agrippina.\r\n\r\n    54—Nero, the son of Agrippina by a former husband, was\r\n      made emperor at seventeen years of age. He exceeded all\r\n      description in folly, extravagance and crime. His violence\r\n      and barbarity fell generally on the patricians and members of\r\n      his court, but he was esteemed by the common people, as were\r\n      most of the emperors, who spent vast sums on theatres and\r\n      spectacles for their amusement. The two bases of the empire\r\n      were the populace and the army. The emperor was terrible\r\n      and tyrannical chiefly to the patricians, while the army\r\n      made him formidable to the provinces and the barbarians. A\r\n      conflagration which some attributed to the orders\r\n    64—of Nero lasted nine days and destroyed the greater part of\r\n      Rome. Nero cast the blame on the Christians, who had become\r\n      numerous, and raised a horrible persecution against them.\r\n\r\n    66—The Jews rebelled and defied the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n    68—Nero was dethroned by the Roman senate and army, and\r\n      committed suicide to avoid punishment for his crimes.\r\n\r\n    69—Three emperors, Galba, Otho and Vitellius, were placed on\r\n      the throne in succession, but rebellions were raised against\r\n      them and all were put to death. Vespasian, then besieging\r\n      Jerusalem, was proclaimed emperor by his army at the desire\r\n      of the rulers of the eastern provinces, and, in the same\r\n      year, overcame all opposition and commenced the first reign\r\n      since Augustus that was free from disgraceful profligacy and\r\n      public crime.\r\n\r\n    70—Titus, the son of Vespasian, captured and destroyed\r\n      Jerusalem. Vespasian, during a reign of ten years, restored\r\n      order and prosperity to Rome and the empire, but not without\r\n      great labor and danger.\r\n\r\n    79—Titus succeeded as emperor, and was remarkable for his\r\n      clemency and care for his subjects. During his reign occurred\r\n      the most fearful eruption of the volcano Vesuvius on record.\r\n      Herculaneum and Pompeii, two wealthy and flourishing cities,\r\n      were destroyed, being buried by the ashes. Pliny, an eminent\r\n      writer, was suffocated while observing the eruption.\r\n\r\n    81—Titus died, to the great grief and loss of mankind, and\r\n      was succeeded by his brother, Domitian, who was one of the\r\n      most infamous rulers that ever desolated the earth. He raised\r\n      a violent persecution against the Christians for refusing to\r\n      adore his statues and worship him as a god. Among the victims\r\n      was his own cousin, Clemens, who had embraced Christianity. He\r\n    96—was assassinated by his wife and officers in\r\n      self-defense, and the senate proclaimed Nerva, a native of\r\n      Crete, emperor. He was remarkable for his lenity and all\r\n      the gentle virtues. He was followed, after a reign of two\r\n    98—years, by Trajan, whom he had adopted as his colleague\r\n      and successor, who is said to have been the greatest and most\r\n      deserving person of his time. He was, by birth, a Spaniard,\r\n      was wise and successful as a warrior and statesman, and\r\n      extremely noble as a man. He bridged the Danube and the\r\n      Euphrates rivers and conquered both the Germans and Parthians\r\n      on the north and east of the empire. A stain on his memory\r\n      was the persecution of the Christians.\r\n\r\n    117—He was succeeded by Adrian, in whose reign all the Roman\r\n      laws, or annual edicts of the prætors, were compiled into one\r\n      body, and law assumed the dignity of a science. He promoted\r\n      literature, but continued the persecution of the Christians.\r\n      A rebellion of the\r\n    139—Jews was punished with merciless severity. He was\r\n      followed by Antoninus Pius, who suspended all persecution\r\n      of Christians, promoted the best interests of all parts of\r\n      the empire, and introduced, during a prosperous reign of\r\n      twenty-two years, the most important reforms into every part\r\n      of the government.\r\n\r\n    161—Marcus Aurelius, called the Philosopher, succeeded.\r\n      He carried on a successful war with the Germans, and made\r\n      the welfare of his subjects his special care, but was\r\n      seduced, by the pagan philosophers, into a persecution of\r\n      the Christians. Having discovered his error he stopped it,\r\n      toward the close of his reign. Commodus,\r\n    180—his son, inherited the purple. He also inherited a\r\n      vicious and cruel disposition, and received a demoralizing\r\n      education from his mother. He was a monster of vice and\r\n      cruelty. He was assassinated in\r\n    192—his bed by his own family and guards to save their lives.\r\n      Pertinax reigned three months, but, attempting to restrain\r\n      the license of the soldiery, he was murdered by them. The\r\n      soldiers in Rome then proclaimed that the empire was for\r\n      sale, and a rich merchant, Didius, bought it from them and\r\n      reigned in Rome two months,\r\n    193—when he was also slain by the army. Septimus Severus,\r\n      an able general, seized the purple which he secured against\r\n      many rivals, and retained for eighteen years. His vigor alone\r\n      prevented general anarchy, but he was systematically cruel.\r\n\r\n    211—Caracalla, his son, succeeded. He was a bloody and\r\n      atrocious tyrant, supported on the throne only by his\r\n      soldiers, whose aid he secured by large pay. He was\r\n    217—murdered by the commander of his guards, Macrinus,\r\n      who succeeded in acquiring his place, but was soon\r\n    218—murdered by the soldiers. They raised Heliogabalus,\r\n      a young Syrian priest of fourteen years of age, through the\r\n      assurance of his female relatives that he was the son of\r\n      Caracalla, to the purple. He is described as the most cruel\r\n      and infamous of all the Roman emperors.\r\n\r\n    222—After four years of horrible crime, he was slain in a\r\n      mutiny of his guard and his body thrown into the Tiber.\r\n      Alexander Severus succeeded. He was apparently a secret\r\n      admirer of Christianity and a model\r\n    235—prince. He was murdered by Maximin, a Thracian peasant,\r\n      who had, by his valor, risen to high command in the army, who\r\n      seized the reins of power. He was successful in war, but his\r\n      severity provoked mutiny in\r\n    238—various parts of the empire, and he was slain by his\r\n      own soldiers. Gordian succeeded, a heroic youth of a noble\r\n      family. He was successful in war, but was murdered\r\n    244—by his own prime minister, Philip, an Arabian, who became\r\n      emperor. He favored the Christians, and reigned five years.\r\n      In his reign, the thousandth year of the foundation of Rome\r\n      was celebrated by public\r\n    249—games. He was slain in a revolt by Decius, the general\r\n      of his army, who occupied the throne. He raised a most\r\n      violent storm of persecution against the Christians, who were\r\n      despoiled of their goods and driven to caves and deserts.\r\n      From this time is dated the sect of\r\n    250—anchorites, or hermits, who imagined they could acquire\r\n      superior holiness by abandoning society and devoting\r\n      themselves to meditation and prayer. The idea appears to\r\n      have been derived from the Persian Magians, who, in this\r\n      century restored the ancient dynasty and religion of the\r\n      Persians, or Parsees, in Persia. During the political and\r\n      social disorganization that soon commenced the anchorites\r\n      became numerous, and the system was extensively prevalent\r\n      for a thousand years to the great injury of active and true\r\n      Christianity.\r\n\r\n    251—Decius was slain in a battle with the Goths, who had\r\n      invaded the empire, and Gallus became emperor.\r\n\r\n    253—He was put to death by Emilianus, who attempted to seize\r\n      the reins of government, but the army elected Valerian,\r\n      governor of Gaul. The empire was invaded by the Goths on\r\n      the north and the Persians under their king, Sapor, on the\r\n      east. From this time, it had to\r\n    259—fight for its life. Valerian was defeated by Sapor\r\n      and remained nine years in captivity, Gallienus, his son,\r\n      becoming emperor. He was extremely incompetent and a\r\n      multitude of rival claimants for the supreme authority arose\r\n      in all directions. They were called the “Thirty Tyrants.” One\r\n      of them, Odenatus, king of Palmyra, in the Syrian desert,\r\n      defeated Sapor, and Gallienus proclaimed him his colleague.\r\n      On the death of Odenatus, his wife, Zenobia, assumed the\r\n      title of “Queen of the East,” conquered Egypt and ruled a\r\n      wide region with success and splendor. Both Goths\r\n    262—and Persians invaded Asia Minor. Gallienus was murdered\r\n    268—and Claudius succeeded. He defeated the Goths\r\n    270—but died in a pestilence. Aurelian succeeded. He was an\r\n      able general. He subdued the Germans and\r\n    272—Goths, and conquered Zenobia, one of the most remarkable\r\n    275—women of history. Aurelian was assassinated by some\r\n      victims of his severity, and Tacitus, a Roman senator\r\n      succeeded, but died in seven months, and was followed by\r\n      Probus. He was a vigorous general, and drove back the\r\n      barbarians on all sides, but attempting to employ his\r\n      soldiers in labor on public works, they\r\n    282—revolted and murdered him. Carus, the captain of the\r\n    283—imperial guard, was raised to the throne. Dying the\r\n      next year, his sons, Carinus and Numerianus, inherited his\r\n      authority, but Numerianus was assassinated in a\r\n    284—few months by his father-in-law, and Diocletian, said to\r\n      have been formerly a slave, was proclaimed emperor by the\r\n      army. This was called “The Era of the Martyrs,” from the long\r\n      and bloody persecutions against the Christians. This was the\r\n      tenth general attack on them, and proved to be the last. The\r\n      barbarians pressing in great force on all sides, Diocletian\r\n      appointed several colleagues, and their united ability drove\r\n      the invaders back.\r\n\r\n    305—Diocletian resigned his power to Galerius, who appointed\r\n      three associates, making a division of the empire. One of\r\n      these, Constantius, died in Britain, and was succeeded\r\n    306—by his son, Constantine. For a time, there were six\r\n      emperors, but one was killed, Galerius died, and Constantine\r\n      conquered the others.\r\n\r\n    312—Constantine changed the whole character of the empire\r\n      by embracing Christianity and relying largely on that\r\n      element for the support of his power, while he disbanded the\r\n      Pretorian, or royal Guard, which had for two hundred years\r\n      assumed to make and unmake emperors, and whose example,\r\n      imitated by the other armies, kept the world periodically\r\n      disturbed by the disputes and battles of rival claimants\r\n      to the imperial purple. By the\r\n    313—edict of Milan, Constantine abolished all laws unfriendly\r\n      to Christianity; he restored the authority of the senate\r\n      and magistrates, and removed his capital from Rome to\r\n      Constantinople.\r\n\r\n    324—The pagan element was now so worn and decrepit that no\r\n      general disorders resulted. Whatever was left rallied under\r\n      Licinus, who was conquered by Constantine. It appears to have\r\n      been the strength of the Christian element and its essential\r\n      hostility to the Roman principle of violent subjugation that\r\n      produced so many and fierce persecutions. Had it not been\r\n      for the pressure of barbarians on the empire the prevalence\r\n      of that system would have preserved society and the state\r\n      for a thousand years more, as it actually did in the Eastern\r\n      empire; but every thing that man has the management of must\r\n      be affected by his limitations, his mistakes and his follies.\r\n      Christianity needed a better ally, a fresher and purer\r\n      society, built up by the young blood and better instincts of\r\n      another and newer people.\r\n\r\n      Constantine paid great respect to the clergy of the church\r\n      and took a leading part in its general counsels—a great\r\n      mistake and a great misfortune.\r\n\r\n    325—His spiritual supremacy was virtually acknowledged at the\r\n      council of Nice which he convoked.\r\n\r\n    330—Constantine died leaving his vast dominions to his three\r\n      sons, who, in the course of ten years, were reduced to one,\r\n      Constantius. After a troubled reign of twenty\r\n    361—years more, he died, and was succeeded by his cousin\r\n      Julian, called the “Apostate,” from his renouncing\r\n      Christianity and laboring to restore the pagan religion. In\r\n      this he signally failed. He undertook to rebuild the Jewish\r\n      temple at Jerusalem, without success.\r\n\r\n    363—He was mortally wounded in an invasion of Persia, and was\r\n      succeeded by Jovian, who restored imperial favor\r\n    364—to the Christian religion. He died after one years\r\n      reign and Valentinian was elected emperor by the council\r\n      of ministers and generals. He divided the empire with his\r\n      brother, Valens, and afterward Rome and Constantinople\r\n      usually had each an emperor. Valentinian died\r\n    375—and was succeeded by his son, Gratian.\r\n\r\n    378—The Huns appeared in Europe, having wandered from\r\n      the borders of China, and defeated Valens with dreadful\r\n      slaughter. Valens himself was among the slain. This was the\r\n      commencement of the great migrations that finally overwhelmed\r\n      the Roman Empire of the west.\r\n\r\n    379—Gratian, left sole emperor, appointed Theodosius, called\r\n      The Great, his colleague, who subdued the Goths, repelled the\r\n      Huns, and restored order.\r\n\r\n    383—Gratian was murdered by the usurper Maximus.\r\n\r\n    388—Theodosius conquered and put Maximus to death and\r\n      restored Valentinian II., brother of Gratian, to the\r\n      throne of the western empire. In a few years the whole\r\n    394—empire was reunited by the death of Valentinian.\r\n      Theodosius soon died, universally lamented, leaving the two\r\n      empires to his sons, Honorius and Arcadius.\r\n\r\n    402—Alaric, the Goth, invaded Italy and, though defeated,\r\n      endangered the safety of Rome.\r\n\r\n    408—Theodosius II. succeeded to the empire of the east.\r\n\r\n    410—Alaric again invaded Italy and sacked Rome. Alaric soon\r\n      after died and his forces were persuaded, by negotiations, to\r\n      leave Italy, but they permanently established themselves in\r\n      Spain and Southern Gaul (France). Thus the empire began to\r\n      fall to pieces.\r\n\r\n    425—Honorius died and Valentinian III. became emperor.\r\n\r\n    429—The Vandals soon conquered the Roman provinces\r\n      in Africa, under their king, Genseric. They extended\r\n    440—their conquests to Sicily.\r\n\r\n    447—Attila, called the “Scourge of God,” appeared at the head\r\n      of the Huns, and Theodosius made a humiliating treaty with\r\n      him to save his dominions from desolation.\r\n\r\n    448—In the next year the Saxons and Angles were invited\r\n      into Britain by the civilized Romans, to protect them from\r\n      the Picts and Scots, and laid the foundation of the modern\r\n      Anglo-Saxon race, and the Franks invaded Gaul laying the\r\n      foundations of the modern kingdom of France. England received\r\n      its name from the Angles—France from the Franks.\r\n\r\n    451—Attila, the Hun, invaded Gaul, and was defeated at\r\n    452—Chalons, by the united Romans and Visigoths. Attila\r\n      then invaded Italy and laid it waste, but died before he\r\n    454—had completed the ruin of the empire. Valentinian\r\n      III. was murdered, and the Vandals from Sicily invaded Italy\r\n      and sacked Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF MODERN NATIONS.\r\n\r\n    476—After a succession of puppet emperors in Rome, Odoacer\r\n      abolished the name and took the title of king of Italy.\r\n      He was a German in command of the auxiliaries in Roman\r\n      pay. Thus ended, in disaster and disgrace, the once mighty\r\n      Roman Empire. Its ruin was gradual and the barbarians who\r\n      overthrew it had already embraced Christianity, so that the\r\n      institutions of the church did not share its fall.\r\n\r\n    486—Clovis, king of the Franks, defeated the Romans and\r\n      Gauls at the battle of Soissons. The Ostrogoths invaded\r\n    492—Italy under Theodoric the Great, deposed Odoacer, and\r\n      founded a new kingdom.\r\n\r\n    496—Clovis defeated the invading Germans and embraced\r\n    500—Christianity. Clovis next defeated the Burgundians.\r\n    507—He subdued the Visigoths and all France was united under\r\n      one rule. He was of the Merovingian line, or dynasty, of\r\n      kings, which lasted over two hundred years, during which the\r\n      remains of Roman civilization and the influence of the church\r\n      were gradually modifying and penetrating the character of a\r\n      new and energetic race.\r\n\r\n    527—Justinian became the ruler of the Eastern or Grecian\r\n      Empire.\r\n\r\n    534—His generals waged war with the Vandals in Africa and the\r\n      Ostrogoths in Italy, and after eighteen years of conflict,\r\n      succeeded in reconquering part of Italy, which the Greek\r\n      emperors continued to hold nominally for about three hundred\r\n      years; the seat of their representative being at Ravenna. He\r\n      was called an Exarch. Rome itself was left, substantially,\r\n      to the control of the Christian bishop. When the Lombards\r\n      founded a kingdom\r\n    568—in the north of Italy they were prevented, by the exarch\r\n      and bishop, from spreading over the southern part; and when\r\n      the exarch threatened to become too powerful to suit the\r\n      views of the bishop, he supported the Lombards. Thus the\r\n      temporal or political power of the popes arose, and they were\r\n      the politic authors of the “Balance of Power” theory, or\r\n      system, that has played so large a part in European history.\r\n      The result has been exceedingly favorable to progress in\r\n      all directions, since it has secured the independence of\r\n      states, and a more various and perfect civilization by the\r\n      development of the special genius of each people. Many\r\n      circumstances conspired to support this idea, in later times,\r\n      and render it very prominent and influential.\r\n\r\n      This gradual advance of the bishop of Rome in political\r\n      influence associated him with the mighty memories of the\r\n      “Eternal City,” and suggested the idea of a spiritual empire\r\n      over all Christendom, which gradually became realized and\r\n      quite changed the character of Christianity for near 800\r\n      years. Hurtful as it ultimately became, by reviving a\r\n      universal despotism over conscience and freedom of thought,\r\n      it was long powerful for good by giving a common centre\r\n      to Europe, broken into fragments as it was by the rise of\r\n      feudalism. That was disorganizing; this was centralizing,\r\n      and kept the channels of communication open and the\r\n      missionary spirit and the elements of a restored learning in\r\n      activity. Its influence in commencing and carrying forward\r\n      the crusades, which substantially broke the strength of\r\n      feudalism, was of immense importance.\r\n\r\n    622—Mahomet arose in the Arabian peninsula, and his new\r\n      religion spread with astonishing rapidity. In one hundred\r\n    732—years from the death of Mahomet the Saracens had\r\n      established a vast empire, covering two thirds of the Roman\r\n      empire, viz.: all of the old Persian empire, Egypt, and all\r\n      of northern Africa and Spain, and threatened to inundate\r\n      Europe. They poured a vast army over the Pyrenees into\r\n      France. This was defeated in a great battle at Tours, by\r\n      Charles Martel, who founded a new dynasty, replacing the\r\n      Merovingian, called the Carlovingian, and made France the\r\n      most powerful, as it became the leading, nation in Europe,\r\n      for promoting civilization during many centuries.\r\n\r\n      By this means the center of political influence, “The Star\r\n      of Empire,” took another step westward. His son, Pepin le\r\n      Bref, or the Short, caused himself to be\r\n    752—crowned king of France by the Roman Pontiff, Stephen\r\n      II., which added to his own prestige, as it also did to that\r\n      of the pope. It was a sort of league between the rising\r\n      temporal and spiritual powers in Europe, and set an example\r\n      long followed. Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, the son of\r\n      Pepin, ascended the throne in 771,\r\n    771—and by his intelligence, energy, and wise statesmanship,\r\n      by his encouragement of learning, his organizing talents\r\n      and his success in conquering and civilizing the seething\r\n      mass of nationalities in Germany, he may be said to have\r\n      really founded modern civilization during his long reign\r\n      of forty-three years. He conquered the Lombard kingdom in\r\n      Italy, and was crowned by the pope, Adrian I, “Emperor of\r\n      the Romans,” kneeling at the altar in Rome; but he virtually\r\n      confirmed the temporal authority of the popes, and associated\r\n      their influence in all his conquests. He thoroughly broke\r\n      the spirit of the pagan Saxons, in northwestern Germany, by\r\n      a war of thirty-three years, carried his conquests east over\r\n      most of the present Austrian empire, civilizing and bringing\r\n      the barbarians into the pale of Christendom by the aid of\r\n      Christian missionaries, and conquered some portions of Spain\r\n      from the Saracens.\r\n\r\n      It seemed as if the history of the western Roman Empire,\r\n      which had fallen three hundred years before, was to be\r\n      repeated. That was the hope and dream of both Charlemagne\r\n      and the Roman Pontiff, who joined hands to realize it. This\r\n      new western emperor had great abilities and the church was\r\n      very strong. The centre of Europe had so long been within\r\n      the reach of civilizing influences, and had attained such a\r\n      point of development in its various nationalities, that they\r\n      readily accepted permanent institutions, when presented by a\r\n      power so strong as that of the mighty Frank ruler.\r\n\r\n    814—But when he died, it was found that there was no other\r\n      hand strong enough to wield his sceptre. All the memories of\r\n      the old empire, all the influence of the Christian church,\r\n      the remains of the Roman organization, and the ripening vigor\r\n      of new races, which had begun to lay aside their barbarous\r\n      impulses, were united to aid the vast designs of this great\r\n      statesman. But the tendencies of the new society, in general,\r\n      were in a different direction. The Germanic civilization\r\n      was totally different from the Roman, and had there been a\r\n      succession of rulers as large minded and strong willed as\r\n      Charlemagne, they could not have repeated the history of the\r\n      ancient world. The tendency of the races that overthrew the\r\n      empire was invincibly against centralization, and instead of\r\n      a new Roman Empire in western Europe, appeared the Feudal\r\n      System.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FEUDAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n1. This system was the direct opposite of centralization. Under it all\r\nChristendom broke up into fragments; the king exerted but a loose general\r\ncontrol, that continued to decrease for several centuries; and most of\r\nthe real authority was exerted by the feudal lords from their fortified\r\ncastles, which, for three hundred years, had been springing up over all\r\nthe territory conquered from the Romans. It had its true origin in the\r\nmarked _personal assertion_, the strong _individuality_ of the Teutonic\r\nRace, which was, and is, one of its most prominent traits. While in their\r\nnative barbarous state their armies were formed for their expeditions of\r\nforeign conquest, that proved so fatal to the Romans, on the voluntary\r\nprinciple. The prowess and fame of a leader, or chief, drew to him a\r\nmultitude of warriors, longing for activity and booty. So long as he\r\ncould lead them to success, to gain their individual ends, they obeyed\r\nhim. When he failed to reward their ambition they held themselves free to\r\nleave him.\r\n\r\n2. It was not immense disciplined armies, but innumerable bands,\r\norganized in this way, that, through a long course of years, gradually\r\noverran Britain, Gaul, Spain and Italy. For four hundred years the\r\ncivilized world had been accustomed to the control and protection of\r\na distant ruler whose powerful armies rendered resistance vain, and\r\nall thought of organization for self-protection against the terrible\r\nbarbarians was wanting when they were attacked. Each city or region\r\ndefended itself as well as possible, or submitted at once. The\r\nconquerors took what they wanted and passed on to other lands, or\r\nspread themselves out over the province. They usually settled in the\r\ncountry parts, fortifying the country seats of the richer inhabitants,\r\nor building themselves castles near the larger towns, to hold them in\r\nawe. The leader considered himself the owner of the conquered territory,\r\nand divided it among his followers, who settled themselves, each in his\r\nnew domain, as its owner and ruler. The conquered inhabitants were his\r\nsubjects from whom he took tribute. The conquerors were few in number in\r\nproportion to the conquered; but there was little resistance throughout\r\nthe old Roman provinces. Organization and spirit were wanting to them,\r\nand resistance would provoke complete ruin, since the conqueror could\r\neasily call to his aid any number of his fellows in return for a share of\r\nthe spoils. Thus they gave what was demanded and made themselves content\r\nwith what was left.\r\n\r\nThe cities paid tribute, the cultivators gave a portion of their\r\nharvests to the new rulers. The territory not given to his followers was\r\nconsidered the property of the original leader. In return for the gift\r\neach of the recipients of territory was held bound to aid him in his\r\nwars, and each larger chief stood in similar relations to the king of his\r\ntribe or nation. Out of this grew, at length, what was called the Feudal\r\nSystem, feudal being derived, by some, from the old German words “fee,”\r\nsalary, and “od,” landed possessions—a payment, or salary, in land, for\r\nservices rendered, with a certain obligation to the giver.\r\n\r\n3. The kings of the Franks—the German nation that conquered Gaul—up to\r\nthe time of Charlemagne, labored to consolidate their power and rule like\r\nthe Roman emperors. But the genius of their race and the peculiarities\r\nof the situation were both opposed to that purpose. Charles Martel,\r\nPepin, his son, and Charlemagne, his grandson, were all rulers of great\r\nvigor, and the last, apparently, succeeded for a time. But the military\r\nstrength lay only in the scattered feudal chieftains, each of whom\r\nsought to build up his own power on his own estates. It was not possible\r\nto maintain a strong central government for any length of time, or\r\nunder an ordinary man. For two hundred years these petty lords grew in\r\nstrength at the expense of the king. They were still held to him by the\r\nnecessity of supporting him in war, by a system of checks, which, in\r\ntime, were increased, and still more enlarged, when the people began\r\nto make themselves felt in the twelfth century; but from the fifth to\r\nthe fifteenth century feudalism was the prevailing system in all the\r\ncivilized European nations.\r\n\r\n4. It was a very rude and violent period, but some of the most happy\r\ntraits of modern life grew out of it. The isolation of the feudal lord\r\nin his fortified chateau or castle, where his wife and children were\r\nhis only equals, combined with the constant influence of the church,\r\ngradually elevated the condition of the woman, the rudeness and violence\r\nof the time were modified by the rise of chivalry, which was, in great\r\npart, founded on this new respect for the gentler sex, and sympathy for\r\nher helpless condition when exposed, without a powerful protector, to\r\nunrestrained insolence and passion; and the feudal system held all the\r\nelements of society in suspense until the mighty forces—revived learning,\r\nthe printing press, and a new commerce and industry—were ready to take a\r\nprominent part in making it what we now find it—far superior to the old\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n5. Feudalism held men apart, and individually subject to the refining\r\ninfluence of Christian precepts, from the fifth to the ninth century,\r\nwhen the romantic practice of chivalry became popular as a relief from\r\nthe tedium of isolation, and a channel for the flow of the softer\r\nsentiments of respect for woman, of compassion for weakness, and, at the\r\nsame time, a vent for the martial spirit which the constant conflicts\r\nof the time cultivated. The age of chivalry indicates that Christianity\r\nwas powerfully moulding the character of the new nations. Working on\r\nqualities as stern and rude as those of the old Roman of the Republic,\r\nits partial control, the beginnings of its power, were manifested in\r\na romantic way. The isolation of feudal life, and a sense of wrong in\r\nemploying all their energies in unceasing contests of ambition produced\r\nthe chivalric outbreak and the crusades. The knights of chivalry were\r\nfeudal lords and gentlemen, trained in all the warlike arts of the period\r\nand in all the courtesies which the new influence of female society\r\nproduced. When starting forth as knight-errants, they were exhorted\r\nby the stern feudal warrior to valor, and by the Christian priest to\r\ngentleness toward the weak and defenseless, and they made it the business\r\nof life to wander about on horseback incased in armor, displaying their\r\nwarlike accomplishments and combatting petty tyranny. There was little\r\npower in the king to right the wrongs of his subjects, and brutal\r\nviolence in the feudal lords had no other effectual punishment. Chivalry\r\nflourished for more than five hundred years; but its most useful days\r\nwere from 1000 to 1200. It was the first, and seems to later times a\r\nsomewhat amusing indication of a more humane social state than the world\r\nhad ever known.\r\n\r\n6. The crusades commenced about 1100, the object being to rescue the\r\nsepulcher of the founder of Christianity from unbelievers. It first\r\nengaged the sympathy of the people at large, then of the feudal nobility\r\nand finally interested the ambition of kings. For two hundred years\r\na large part of the best blood of Europe was poured out in Palestine\r\nin a vain effort to expel the Saracens from it. The transportation of\r\narmaments and supplies to that country from various parts of Europe\r\ngradually led to commerce and skill in navigation; so much of ancient\r\ncivilization and knowledge as still existed in the Eastern, or Greek\r\nEmpire at Constantinople, was introduced into modern Europe, which at the\r\nsame time was relieved of its more turbulent and adventurous elements;\r\nand a heavy blow was given to the smaller feudal proprietors by the\r\nexpense incurred in a distant expedition where they died without issue,\r\nreduced their families to poverty, or whence they returned penniless\r\nto mortgaged estates. It rapidly hastened the movement, begun by other\r\ninfluences, to reduce the number of feudal proprietors, and render\r\ngovernment more vigorous over increasingly large territories.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV.\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n1. Between 1000 and 1200 the independent and enterprising spirit—the\r\nindividualism—that we have seen at the base of European character, and\r\nwhich first produced the Feudal System, began to move among the masses\r\nin various ways and laid the foundation for that influence of the People\r\nthat was afterward to become the most powerful element in political life.\r\n\r\nIt first presented itself in the development of industrial arts and\r\ncommerce in cities which obtained, as corporations, the rights, or a part\r\nof the rights, of the feudal proprietor, which they proceeded to exercise\r\nunder the form of Free Cities in Germany, privileged Communes in France\r\nand commercial Republics in Italy.\r\n\r\n2. A second development, highly favorable some centuries later to the\r\nreaction of popular freedom against centralizing despotism in the\r\ngovernment, was the religious protest against the claims of the church\r\nover freedom of thought. This spirit grew up in Germany, and its first\r\nremote beginnings are to be found in the imperial title conferred by\r\nthe pope on Charlemagne. In the course of time (A. D. 963) that title\r\nwas inherited by the German rulers who, for a long time, struggled for\r\nthe control of Italy and a feudal superiority over the popes. This was\r\ncarried on for two centuries with much acrimony, in which the terms\r\nGuelph, the general name of those who supported the side of the popes,\r\nand Ghibellines, of those who rallied to the emperor, came to be the\r\nwatchwords of Germany and Italy. The popes triumphed in this contest,\r\nwhich prevented the establishment of a vast and powerful political\r\ndespotism, and gave the church a temporal kingdom in a part of Italy,\r\nwith an immense spiritual empire highly embarrassing to free mental\r\ngrowth. The reaction against this spiritual control produced the\r\nProtestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, in which was wrapped up\r\nthe germ of modern Republicanism.\r\n\r\n3. The Crusades loosened the bonds of Feudalism, taught nations and\r\nrulers to act together to gain a common object, enlarged the experiences\r\nof men immensely, and cultivated and organized the spirit of personal\r\nadventure which afterwards expended itself on commerce.\r\n\r\nIt was at about the crisis of this period (1215, A. D.) that the Magna\r\nCharta—the foundation of English constitutional liberty—was produced;\r\nthat the Hanseatic League and Free Cities began to flourish in Germany;\r\nthe commercial republics of Venice, Genoa and Florence rose in Italy; and\r\nthe communal corporations in France sprang up. They were all more or less\r\nstimulated by influences growing out of the Crusades, and brought forward\r\nthe _people_ and their distinct and separate interests and activities\r\ninto political importance. This was the beginning of an entirely new\r\norder of things, which required a new continent for its full development.\r\n\r\n4. A first circumstance, above all favorable to the liberties of the\r\npeople, was the Invention of Printing, producing rapid diffusion of\r\ninformation, the coincident revival of learning and the foundation of\r\nmodern science. All these, working together with various other agencies,\r\ngradually swept away feudalism, checked the towering spiritual tyranny of\r\nthe church and corrected a crowd of minor evils that embarrassed society,\r\nenterprise, and progress in the science of government.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate stage in this progress appeared like a return to old\r\nprinciples. The dissolution of feudalism left the governments of Europe\r\ncentralized. The lords inheriting feudal rights had become intolerable\r\ndespots. For a certain period the authority of the king was the bulwark\r\nbehind which the people sheltered themselves from the oppressions\r\nof their feudal superiors, and they united with him to reduce the\r\nfeudal nobility to the comparatively harmless condition of the modern\r\naristocracy, whose greatest distinction is social pre-eminence. It left\r\nthem, indeed, a high, but not overwhelming, position in the body politic,\r\nwhich the growing education and wealth of the middle and lower classes\r\nconstantly tended to reduce. This change was commencing when America\r\nwas discovered. The feudal chiefs labored to extend and strengthen\r\ntheir power at the expense of each other, of the king and the people.\r\nThe increasing activity and importance of commerce, trade and industry\r\nrequired the support of a broad legislation that could not be obtained\r\nwhile nations were broken up into petty lordships, principalities\r\nand kingdoms almost independent of each other, and whose rulers were\r\noften hostile to or at war with each other; while the support of so\r\nmany rulers became a heavy burden on the resources of the people. The\r\nking represented the nation and was the rallying point of reform. To\r\nstrengthen him was to promote the larger interests of the country.\r\n\r\n5. For these reasons, and from the resistance offered by the feudal\r\ninstitutions, which had existed a thousand years, authority became\r\ncentralized in the monarch to an extravagant degree, and this at a time\r\nwhen freer institutions were most required by the larger and wiser\r\nviews of the people. The great usefulness of the Roman Catholic Church\r\nin civilizing and educating the modern nations and founding a center\r\nor common bond between them, which produced a degree of unity in their\r\nprogress, had continually added to her power, while the disposition\r\nto free thought was ever becoming more pronounced. Thus two despotic\r\nforces, each claiming absolute obedience in their respective spheres,\r\nwere rising in strength to a degree extremely embarrassing to the growing\r\nintelligence and increased activities of the commonalty. The traditional\r\nauthority of the church and the king came, in the course of a hundred\r\nyears after the discovery of America, to directly oppose the most\r\nimportant interests and instincts of mankind.\r\n\r\n6. The progress of the people, as distinct from that of their\r\ngovernments, may then be described as starting in the last great service\r\ndone for Europe by the church—the organization of the Crusades. The\r\nfeudal system separated men too much for healthy progress, and this\r\nsingular display of religious zeal united the various nationalities in\r\na common effort, and stirred up powers that had long slumbered. It was\r\nin this period that the adventurous and comprehensive activities of\r\nmodern life commenced. Wealth had been largely confined to the feudal\r\nnobility. It now began to flow out through the general community. The\r\nnobles expended vast sums in fitting out princely retinues to lead to the\r\nHoly Land, for which their estates were security. They died, or returned\r\npenniless, and their lands passed into the hands of the commercial\r\nclasses, whose successful diligence had made them wealthy. It was the\r\nfirst heavy blow to feudal institutions, and laid the foundation of the\r\npower of the people.\r\n\r\nCorporations and cities which had obtained the rights of feudal\r\nproprietors, employed them for the purposes of self-government, and\r\nso used an instrument of despotism to shield and sustain a virtual\r\ndemocracy. With this freedom of action, popular liberty, controlled in\r\na general way by feudal obligations to the prince, king, or emperor,\r\ngrew fast and strong protected by the growing despotisms of the church\r\nand the state. The Hanseatic League, in the north of Germany, was, in\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, perhaps as wealthy and powerful\r\nas any king or emperor in Christendom; and in the sixteenth, the small\r\ncommercial province of the Netherlands could defy the whole power of\r\nSpain, with the wealth of the Indies at her back.\r\n\r\n7. The revival of learning, and the invention of the art of printing,\r\ngave an immense impulse to this uprising of the people, commenced\r\nnear three hundred years before; about the same time the Portuguese\r\ndiscovered the way to India by the Cape of Good Hope, Columbus threw\r\nopen the “Gates of the West,” and the wealth of both Indies flowed in a\r\nfull stream through the channels of commerce and trade; that is to say,\r\ninto the hands of the busy and industrious people. All events seemed\r\nto conspire to build up a base for the power and development of the\r\ncommonalty.\r\n\r\nThis growing intelligence and strength among the masses, with the habit\r\nof ruling themselves under feudal forms, made a conflict with the two\r\narrogant despotisms inevitable in the near future. Feudal institutions\r\nwere still a serious and vexatious embarrassment to freedom of movement,\r\nand a very heavy tax on industry, and the only legal way to remove it was\r\nby strengthening the central or kingly power, which continued to increase\r\nfor more than a hundred years; but the conflict with priestly despotism\r\nwas entered on at once. A vast rebellion against the church commenced,\r\ncalled “The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century,” which embraced nearly\r\nall the most enterprising and commercial nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION ON THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n1. We have said that great men were a kind of summary of the tendencies\r\nof their period; an expression of a wide-spread thought or state of\r\nmind, which their fortunate combination of faculties and more favorable\r\ncircumstances enabled them first to state, or embody, with distinctness;\r\nthat the great following they obtained, and the extensive influence\r\nwhich enabled them to make great changes, were due to a coincident\r\ndevelopment in their generation of the same thoughts and tendencies. This\r\nexplains the existence of _eras_ in all departments of life. Men grow,\r\nor progress, silently, from one to the other; when the general progress\r\nhas reached the suitable point it breaks out in a leader more bold and\r\npositive than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America was such an era; and the sudden advance in\r\nmany ways at about the same time was the result of gradual growth during\r\nmany centuries. It was shown by the sudden appearance of great men in\r\ndifferent spheres. Columbus lived in the midst of a great era. Printing,\r\nthe use of the compass, the science of astronomy and the successful\r\nprotest against spiritual despotism all commenced their great career\r\njust before, or just after him. The great painters, whose works are\r\nnow so much esteemed, were all living in 1500. Copernicus discovered\r\nthe true planetary system in the year Columbus died. Gunpowder, which\r\nenabled Cortez to conquer the Mexican Empire, came into general use\r\nabout the same period. Luther commenced the Reformation, while the first\r\nadventurers were creeping, with amazed curiosity, around the shores of\r\nthe American continent. The foundation of all the sciences was then laid.\r\nCorrect principles were enunciated for religion, government and thought;\r\nand the laws of nature, of human relations and of religious liberty were\r\npromulgated almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\n2. But not all the European nations, and not _all_ of any one nation,\r\nwere prepared for this vast advance. The southern part of Germany, and\r\nthe people in general in southern Europe, resisted what they regarded\r\nas a dangerous innovation, and the reform spread only north and west.\r\nThe close connection instituted by Constantine between church and state,\r\nwhich was renewed under Charlemagne, raised at this time, a long series\r\nof religious wars, which contributed to embarrass Protestantism in the\r\nsame way by the necessity under which it lay, (or supposed it lay,) of\r\nseeking the protection of princes. Luther’s reorganized church became\r\nthe state religion of northern Europe, and fell under government control\r\nin Switzerland and Holland. Henry VIII. of England, while yielding, like\r\na true Englishman, to the general tendency of his people, in taking the\r\nreformed faith under his protection constituted himself its head.\r\n\r\nIn the long contest between Catholic and Protestant, it became apparent\r\nthat full religious liberty was not then possible in Europe; and the\r\nmore, that a political element was involved in the contest. Free thought\r\nnaturally led to free institutions, and the leading European governments\r\nwere, by the breaking up of feudalism, centralized and made more despotic\r\nthan ever. Thus its tendency to political revolution organized strong\r\ngovernments against it, or prevented its development by the check of\r\ngovernmental supremacy.\r\n\r\n3. While this contest was working itself out in the firm establishment of\r\nProtestantism under state patronage in northern Europe, and its entire\r\nextinction in the stronger and more conservative southern monarchies,\r\nthe discovery and subjugation of Mexico and Peru, with their wealth of\r\nprecious metals and tropical productions, together with the trade with\r\nthe East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, passage to which was discovered\r\nbefore the daring venture of Columbus, had greatly enriched Europe. A\r\nlarge part of this wealth passed immediately, or in process of time,\r\ninto the hands of the people as the result of personal adventure or of\r\nthe activity of commerce, trade and industry. The maritime regions of\r\nnorthern Germany, Holland and England gathered much of this golden fruit;\r\nthe maritime republics of Italy fell into decay; and Spain spent its vast\r\ntreasures in war. It was led to this suicidal policy by various royal\r\nmarriages which united the German Empire, Spain and the Netherlands under\r\none scepter. This vast ascendancy, united with great wealth, excited the\r\nalarm of other nations, and contributed to strengthen the Reformation.\r\nThe Protestant princes of Germany and the king of France united to reduce\r\nthis dangerous pre-eminence in order to uphold the existing nationalities\r\nof Europe, or the Balance of Power, as it was called. Thus the emperor,\r\nCharles V., was led to pour out the treasures of Mexico and Peru to\r\nsustain his political aspirations, and his wars turned the wealth of the\r\nIndies into the channels of commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Philip II., still uniting Spain and the Netherlands,\r\nundertook to crush the reformed faith in the latter states, and failed\r\nin a war of nearly half a century. This vast expense made Spain, the\r\nrichest country of Europe, the poorest, still to the profit of commerce\r\nand the greater strength of Protestant lands. The United Netherlands\r\nbecame free Protestant states and remarkably prosperous.\r\n\r\n4. The English people advanced in laying the foundations of a free\r\nconstitution from the time of the Magna Charta in 1215. They became\r\nstrongly Protestant, and finally their commons engaged in a contest\r\nwith the king, Charles I., for the maintenance of popular rights.\r\nHe resisted to the last extremity, and the commons precipitated a\r\nrevolution that dethroned and beheaded him, and established a republic.\r\nThis was premature and expired with the great leader, Cromwell, who\r\nhad successfully headed it. Royal power was restored, but a few years\r\nlater was rearranged and so modified as to be suited to the independent\r\nbut moderate tendencies of the people. A certain part of the English\r\npeople, however, aspired to more complete liberty than a monarchy could\r\nafford them, and passed over the sea to secure freedom of conscience and\r\npolitical enfranchisement in the New World.\r\n\r\nWith the moderate and steady maintenance of their rights, characteristic\r\nof Englishmen, they were governed under charters from the English\r\nsovereigns who, for the sake of extending their dominions, allowed them\r\nmuch freedom. European governments could not conform to the demands of\r\nprogress by loosening the bands of arbitrary rule, and the new colonies\r\nbecame the refuge of such as aspired to more liberal institutions, as\r\nwell as of adventurers in search of gain. Thus the English colonies\r\nbecame the escape valve of European politics and society, the Appendix of\r\nthe Reformation, and the Hope of Liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n1. We see here again the operation of the constant law that impelled men,\r\nor moved the “Star of Empire,” westward. The form of the continents,\r\nthe character of the surface and the climate, provided a natural and\r\ndesirable opening only in that direction. The overplus of population,\r\nthe discontent of some part of the people with existing government, the\r\nrestlessness of adventurers, or the requirements of trade and commerce\r\nproduced a migration. The colony, instructed by the experience of the\r\nparent state, was free to improve on its institutions. Colonies have\r\nalmost always prospered more than the mother country. Transplanting\r\nseemed to improve both the stock and the institutions. Greece was\r\ncolonized from Asia, as was Rome; Miletus, Syracuse, and other Greek\r\ncolonies excelled the mother cities in wealth, and though the free\r\nstructure of Grecian government allowed a natural development at home and\r\nmade Athens the metropolis, yet its marvelous genius was nourished and\r\nstimulated by the colonies. Carthage was greater and stronger than Tyre,\r\nand contended with Rome for the control of the world; the most western\r\nnations of Europe were colonized from Rome and Germany, and have taken\r\nthe lead in later progress, while America has always displayed the lusty,\r\nfertile vigor of a young life.\r\n\r\nThus the conformation of the surface of the earth, and the peculiarly\r\nfruitful character of a transplanted civilization, have always furnished\r\nan escape from the embarrassing fixity of an old state, in the same\r\nwestern direction, and the old and the new unite to establish frequent\r\nstages of progress. In this way a continuous growth has been secured that\r\nimpresses on advancing culture the same unity, from first to last, that\r\nwe see in the growth and mental development of the individual man.\r\n\r\n2. We have seen the aggregation and primary discipline of mankind in the\r\nsimple but extensive despotisms of western Asia, varied in Palestine\r\nby a theocratic system which has produced the world’s great religion,\r\nand in Egypt by the predominance of a learned priestly caste. We saw\r\nan improvement made in Greece to meet the demands of intellectual\r\ndevelopment. Their intelligence, however, was a spontaneous outburst, of\r\nnecessity immature. Two thousand years of training, and the addition of\r\nmany new elements were required before mind could _rule_ the world; but\r\nGreece, by the attractiveness of her art and culture, set men at work on\r\nthe great problem of politics and life.\r\n\r\nRome followed to organize government and consolidate the civilizations,\r\nto ripen their fruit and transmit the seed to a more favorable time, and\r\nto new and better races. A complete civilization was impossible without\r\nwell digested science, which had its remote roots in Greece; and law,\r\nwhich was gradually produced by the grand Roman republic; and a clear\r\nunderstanding of the profound yet simple precepts of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n3. Western Europe received all the wisdom and experience of the ancient\r\nworld, and labored well at the grand problem, though she did not\r\ncompletely solve it. She, however, made an immense advance toward it, and\r\nher children, rich in her experience, instructed at once by her success\r\nand her mistakes, and aided always by her wisdom, found (let us hope) in\r\nAmerica the goal of their noblest aspirations. Thus we find the spirit\r\nof progress traversing the whole course of human history, constantly\r\nadvancing through all the confusion of rising and falling states, of\r\nbattle, siege and slaughter, of victory and defeat; through the varying\r\nfortunes and ultimate extinction of monarchy, republic and empire;\r\nthrough barbaric irruption and desolation, feudal isolation, spiritual\r\nsupremacy, the heroic rush and conflict of the Cross and the Crescent;\r\namid the busy hum of industry, through the marts of trade and behind\r\nthe gliding keels of commerce; through the bloody conflicts of commons,\r\nnobles, kings and kaisers to New and Free America. There the Englishman,\r\nthe German, the Frenchman, the Italian, the Scandinavian, the Asiatic and\r\nthe African all meet as equals. There they are free to speak, to think,\r\nand to act. They bring their common contributions of character, energy\r\nand activity to the support and enlargement of a common country, and the\r\nspread of its influence and enlightenment through all the lands of their\r\norigin. As America is the common ground on which all the currents and\r\nideas of all the civilizations meet, so also it is the point from which\r\nreturn currents, hastened by lightning and by steam, seek again every\r\nquarter of the earth with kindly greetings, to renew the relations broken\r\nin the original separation of the races, and to cement, by exchanges\r\nmutually profitable, a new and better unity of mankind. As the heart\r\nin the human body receives the current of blood from all parts of the\r\nsystem, and, having revitalized it, returns it with fresh elements of\r\nstrength, so America adopts the children of all lands only to return a\r\nmanhood ennobled by a sense of its own dignity through the practice of a\r\nsystem of self-government which improves the condition and promotes the\r\ninterest of each while it produces harm to none.\r\n\r\n4. America, then, will colonize Ideas, extensively, when her institutions\r\nare thoroughly matured. The process, indeed, commenced with her birth,\r\nand her Spirit sails with her ships in every sea and visits all lands.\r\nAll the past has contributed to the excellence of her foundation, and\r\nmodern Europe has supplied her with the most desirable building material\r\nboth of ideas and of men. Without Asia, Greece and Rome, there would have\r\nbeen a very imperfect modern Europe; and without modern Europe, America\r\nmust have begun at the beginning, with all the lessons, discoveries and\r\ndiscipline of thousands of years to learn. Happily, we seem authorized to\r\nbelieve that, as she concludes the possible great migrations of humanity,\r\nshe has so well learned the lessons of experience as to have given due\r\nflexibility and capacity of improvement to all her institutions, and,\r\nwhen necessary can _reconstruct_ herself _within_ herself. If this be\r\ntrue, she will reach the goal of all progress by furnishing to each\r\nindividual among her citizens such aid as a state can give to make the\r\nmost of himself, to reach the fullest expression of his value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Civilization, or the history of it, at least, commenced in the Eastern\r\ncontinent. The Western was, until a comparatively recent period, quite\r\nunknown to those who recorded the progress of mankind, and the events by\r\nwhich it was marked. The science of the most learned men and nations of\r\nancient times did not extend to a comprehension of geography beyond the\r\nlimits of their own countries, and of the countries conquered by their\r\nrulers, or those which, bordering on these, held some relations with them.\r\n\r\n2. The world appeared to be a flat surface, and no one thought of\r\nquestioning that it was so _only_ in appearance. It was reserved for a\r\ndaring Genoese sea captain, about four hundred years ago, to conceive the\r\nhappy idea that this appearance was deceptive; that it was really round;\r\nand that, by sailing westward, the distant East, or India, might be\r\nreadily reached. Columbus, having become fully satisfied that this theory\r\nwas correct, and not being rich enough to fit out an expedition himself,\r\nendeavored to convince others, who had the means, of the truth of his\r\nviews, and to induce them to aid him to put them to the test.\r\n\r\n3. The Genoese, living by commerce, and, at that time wealthy and\r\npowerful, gave him no encouragement. They even regarded him as a madman.\r\nHe applied to the Governments of Portugal, England, and Spain, but gained\r\nlittle attention for many years. At length Queen Isabella, of Spain,\r\nbecame interested in his theories, and, with much effort, assisted\r\nhim to put them to proof. He set sail August 3, 1492, with three small\r\nvessels, on an unknown sea. His crew were filled with fear to find\r\nthemselves so far from land, and sailing toward unknown dangers. He had\r\ngreat difficulty in calming their terrors, and was in great danger of\r\nperishing in the mutiny they contemplated. He was saved by the opportune\r\nappearance of land on the 11th of October. He had reached the group of\r\nislands lying between North and South America. The one first discovered\r\nwas called, by the natives whom he found inhabiting it, Guanahani. He\r\nnamed it, in remembrance of his peril, San Salvador—St. Savior. Supposing\r\nhe had reached the Indies lying to the eastward of Asia, and not dreaming\r\nof a new continent, he called the inhabitants Indians. Cuba and Hayti,\r\nlarger islands lying further south, were soon after discovered, and he\r\nhastened to carry back the wonderful tidings of his discovery to Spain.\r\nHe reached home seven months and eleven days after his departure.\r\n\r\n4. He and his discoveries immediately became famous. The world had never\r\nbeen struck with a surprise so great, and all Europe was in a ferment\r\nat the news. He soon returned as Viceroy of the newly discovered lands,\r\nto establish a colony and extend his researches. Five years later, in\r\n1498, he discovered the main land near the river Orinoco, in the northern\r\npart of South America. He died in 1506, unaware of the magnitude of his\r\ndiscoveries, still believing he had only reached India from the west, and\r\ntreated with much ingratitude by the government he had so much benefited\r\nby his bold genius. The first published account of the new continent was\r\nby a Florentine, Amerigo Vespucci, who visited the main land in 1499,\r\nclaimed the merit of the discovery, and gave it his name, America. His\r\nclaim has long been disallowed, and Columbus duly honored as the real\r\ndiscoverer, though the name was never changed.\r\n\r\n5. It is believed that North America was known to the mariners of the\r\nNorth of Europe as early as the tenth century; and that settlements, that\r\nafterwards perished, were made from Iceland and Greenland as far south\r\nas the shores of New England. This, however, is only a dim tradition,\r\nthere being no detailed and authentic history of these events left on\r\nrecord so far as is yet known.\r\n\r\n6. An English mariner, by descent a Venitian, disputes with Columbus the\r\nfirst sight of the main continent in 1498. He first touched the coast of\r\nLabrador, and sailed as far south as Florida in the next year. It was\r\nnear a hundred years later before a permanent settlement was made within\r\nthe territory that is now the United States, by the English, though the\r\ncity of St. Augustine was founded in Florida by the Spaniards in 1565.\r\n\r\nIn 1607 a settlement was made at Jamestown, on the Potomac river, in\r\nVirginia, and in 1620 the Puritans of England, persecuted there for their\r\nreligious views, sought liberty of worship in the new world, establishing\r\na colony at Plymouth, in the eastern part of New England. Others\r\nfollowed in succession until many distinct colonies had been planted on\r\nthe eastern coast of the United States; all of which—except Florida,\r\nbelonging to the Spaniards, on the south, and Canada, settled by the\r\nFrench, on the north—were under the control of, and received their laws\r\nfrom, England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF ANGLO AMERICAN COLONIZATION FROM 1492 TO 1763.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1493—October 12, Christopher Columbus discovered land\r\n      belonging the Western Hemisphere—one of the Bahama Islands.\r\n      He touches at Cuba and Hayti before his return.\r\n\r\n    1497—John Cabot, master of an English vessel, and his son\r\n      Sebastian, touched at Newfoundland in June, and soon after\r\n      explored the coast of Labrador.\r\n\r\n    1498—Columbus, on his third voyage, discovers the American\r\n      Continent, near the mouth of the Orinoco river, in South\r\n      America.\r\n\r\n      —Sebastian Cabot, in a second voyage, first of Europeans,\r\n      explores our Atlantic coast as far south as Maryland.\r\n\r\n    1499—Amerigo Vespucci, or Americus Vespucius, a Florentine\r\n      merchant, conducts a vessel to the coast of South America.\r\n      Returning to Europe he publishes a book, claiming to have\r\n      first discovered the continent, and it receives his name,\r\n      America.\r\n\r\n    1500—Columbus is sent to Spain in chains by a Spanish officer\r\n      whom the jealousy of Ferdinand, the Spanish King, placed\r\n      over him.

But, while the colonies bore a large part of the burden,\r\n(they had raised $16,000,000 of its expenses, and had lost, in battle\r\nor in hospital, 30,000 men,) of a war that drove the French out of all\r\ntheir possessions in Canada and east of the Mississippi river; they were,\r\nat the same time, trained to act in concert, which paved the way for a\r\nfuture confederation, and hardened them to war. Being called into battle\r\nunder celebrated English commanders, and to fight side by side with\r\nEuropean veterans, they had opportunity to learn the art of war, as well\r\nas to compare themselves with the soldiers of the mother country and of\r\nFrance. This comparison was favorable to them, and inspired them with\r\nconfidence in their own ability.\r\n\r\nThe fatal blunders of Gen. Braddock, and the skill and bravery of\r\nWashington and his provincial troops which, alone, saved the British\r\narmy from entire annihilation in the Pennsylvania wilderness, was never\r\nforgotten. They felt themselves, even as raw militia, equal to the best\r\nEuropean soldiers, when on their own ground.\r\n\r\nIt was a great mistake of the Home Government to put on an arrogant\r\ntone with them just when they had learned their strength. In the\r\nyear 1764 that government, plunged in debt by its long wars with the\r\ncontinental powers, (it amounted to $700,000,000,) and on the plea that\r\nthe colonies who had been protected, should bear a fair share of the\r\npecuniary burden, determined to impose taxes on them. Previously they had\r\nrestricted their commerce to English ports, had laid duties on various\r\nimports, and assumed authority to change the governments of the colonies\r\nwithout their consent. This had produced much dissatisfaction, but had\r\nno further immediate effect than to lead them to remonstrance, evasion,\r\nor legal resistance. The proposal to lay _internal taxes_ was quite\r\nanother affair. Submission to this they thought would be fatal to their\r\nliberties. They resisted with general moderation, respectfully, but with\r\ndetermined resolution.\r\n\r\nThe British ministry were provoked by this resistance, holding it to\r\nbe rebellion; and determined to put it down, by force, if need be.\r\nThe struggle continued for ten years with growing obstinacy on either\r\nside. The home government was exceedingly obtuse or it would have\r\neither proceeded to extremes at once or yielded the whole case, as it\r\nfinally determined to do in 1776, when it was too late. In this period\r\nof lively discussion, and of organization to secure the strength of\r\nunion in resistance, the separate colonies were gradually moulded\r\ninto a nation, imbued with common sympathies and ideas, and moved by\r\ncommon interests. They had not thought of independence during all this\r\npreliminary struggle. The war had lasted a year before that idea became\r\nprominent. That was not, even then, regarded as an _end_, so much as\r\nan indispensable _means_ to secure their liberties. Thus we see that\r\nno taint of _conspiracy_ attached to the revolutionary struggle. The\r\ncolonies were thoroughly loyal, until loyalty came to mean loss of\r\nliberty, and the rights enjoyed by Englishmen in England. The exercise\r\nof arbitrary power they felt it right to resist; but they exhausted all\r\nother modes and means of resistance before they resorted to arms.\r\n\r\nThey did not even make a first attack. They waited till armies were sent\r\nto subjugate them, and until those armies commenced the attack; then the\r\nwhole country rose in the stern resolve to right their wrongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n1763.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Paris was signed in February of this year. July 7th began\r\n“Pontiac’s War,” with the simultaneous attack on all the forts in the\r\npeninsula of Michigan, and the whole frontier of Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia. Pontiac was an Ottawa chief, of great ability, and had drawn\r\nmany Indian tribes into the war. It was virtually ended in September of\r\nthe same year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1764.\r\n\r\n    April 5.—“The Sugar Act” was passed in the English\r\n      Parliament. This levied duties on coffee, pimento, French and\r\n      East India goods, and forbade iron and lumber to be exported\r\n      except to England. It was for the avowed purpose of raising\r\n      a revenue, and raised instead a storm of indignation. The\r\n      Massachusetts House of Representatives said: “If we are taxed\r\n      and not represented, we are slaves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n1765.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 27—Was passed the obnoxious Stamp Act. Also the military\r\n      law was made to authorize the ministry to send any number of\r\n      troops to the colonies, for whom the colonists were to find\r\n      “quarters, fire-wood, bedding, drink, soap, and candles.”\r\n\r\n    May 29—Patrick Henry introduced five “Resolutions” into\r\n      the Virginia House of Burgesses, claiming for Virginians\r\n      the rights of British subjects; that only their own\r\n      representatives could lawfully tax them; declaring the\r\n      attempt to vest that power in any other hands subversive of\r\n      both British and American liberty.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 1—The Pennsylvania Assembly passed similar resolutions.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 7—A congress of delegates, or committees, from nine\r\n      colonies, met in New York. It was the first Continental\r\n      Congress. Its spirit harmonized with that of Massachusetts,\r\n      Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and its “Declaration of Rights\r\n      and Grievances” was cordially approved by all the colonial\r\n      assemblies.\r\n\r\n\r\n1766.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 29—The Stamp Act could not be enforced in America, and\r\n      it was repealed by Parliament; but the repeal was followed by\r\n      another act asserting the power and right of Parliament “to\r\n      bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.” Thus yielding the\r\n      _thing_ and asserting the _principle_, they both strengthened\r\n      the colonies by a sense of their power, and exasperated them\r\n      by a total denial of their Declaration of Rights.\r\n\r\n    May—Yet their triumph filled the colonies with joy, and\r\n      gratitude toward the King and their English friends. Virginia\r\n      voted the King a statue.\r\n\r\n\r\n1767.\r\n\r\n    June—But their exultation was short-lived. In this year taxes\r\n      were levied on tea, paints, paper, glass, and lead. This led\r\n      to the determination, on the part of the colonies, to pay no\r\n      more taxes or duties at all.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 28—The Governor of Massachusetts having refused to\r\n      call the General Court (or legislative body of the colony)\r\n      together, a public meeting was held and resolutions passed\r\n      to encourage “economy, industry, and manufactures,” and a\r\n      committee appointed to get subscribers to an agreement to\r\n      discontinue the importation of British goods not absolute\r\n      necessaries. This was imitated in other colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n1768.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 11—Massachusetts General Court issues a general circular\r\n      to other colonial assemblies, inviting coöperation for the\r\n      defense of colonial rights. Those bodies mostly gave cordial\r\n      replies. This General Court having\r\n\r\n    July—been dissolved, the new one being called on to rescind\r\n      this circular, refused by a vote of ninety-two to seventeen.\r\n      These seventeen became the butt of public scorn.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 12—Four regiments of British troops ordered to Boston.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—The governor had been desired, by a Boston “town\r\n      meeting,” to call a General Court. He refused, and the\r\n      “meeting” issued a call for delegates from the towns to\r\n      a colonial convention. More than a hundred towns were\r\n      represented in the convention meeting this day. Their main\r\n      effort was to vindicate the\r\n\r\n    ” 28—colony from the charge of a rebellious spirit. The day\r\n      after this meeting adjourned two regiments of British troops\r\n      arrived in Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n1769.\r\n\r\n    Jan’y—Parliament severely censures all the colonial acts, and\r\n      directs that persons arrested in the colonies for treason be\r\n      sent to England, to be tried.\r\n\r\n    May—The Virginia Assembly take strong ground against this,\r\n      and agree with the Massachusetts Convention.\r\n\r\n    ” 31—The Massachusetts General Court assembles, but refuses\r\n      to transact business in the midst of an armed force. After\r\n      long contest with them the Governor adjourned them to\r\n      Cambridge.\r\n\r\n    June 13—Required to support the troops, they respectfully\r\n      and temperately, but firmly, refuse, and decline to vote any\r\n      supplies for government till their grievances are redressed.\r\n\r\n    July 15—All the colonies manifest the same spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n1770.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 5—The indignation of Boston at the presence of troops\r\n      breaks out into an affray. The troops fire on the citizens.\r\n      Three are killed and five wounded. It was called the “Boston\r\n      Massacre.”\r\n\r\n    April—British Parliament repeals the last tax on all articles\r\n      but tea. The non-importation agreements had exerted a great\r\n      influence in promoting economy, encouraging manufactures, and\r\n      bringing “home-made” into fashion. The graduating class in\r\n      Harvard College took their degrees in “home-spun” this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1771.\r\n\r\n    Throughout this year the same disputes were maintained\r\n      between the governors and colonial legislatures as formerly;\r\n      but as the home government did not push the struggle to an\r\n      issue, there was comparative quiet, but no yielding.\r\n\r\n\r\n1772.\r\n\r\n    June 10—The Gaspe, a British revenue schooner, burned by a\r\n      party from Providence, Rhode Island. Parliament offers six\r\n      hundred pounds sterling and a pardon to any accomplice who\r\n      will confess and give up the offenders. They were well known\r\n      by colonists, but no legal evidence could ever be obtained.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 28—A committee appointed in Boston to state the rights\r\n      of the colonists and correspond with other sections on this\r\n      subject. They publish an address, which is extensively\r\n      circulated. Franklin, agent for the colonies in England,\r\n      republishes it there.\r\n\r\n\r\n1773.\r\n\r\n    March—This address led to the first measures for a political\r\n      union of the colonies.\r\n\r\n    July—The British ministry attempt to import tea into the\r\n      colonies.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 2—The people of Philadelphia declare that any one who\r\n      shall “aid or abet in unloading, receiving, or vending the\r\n      tea is an enemy to his country.”\r\n\r\n    Nov. 3—The Boston consignees required by the people to\r\n      resign. They refuse.\r\n\r\n    ” 5-19—A legal town meeting takes them in hand, and at length\r\n      they resign.\r\n\r\n    Dec’r—Three ships loaded with tea having arrived, the\r\n      people labor for near a month to have them sent back. Not\r\n      succeeding, the cargoes are all emptied into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n1774.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 25—Parliament retaliated by the “Boston Port Bill,”\r\n      closing it to commerce.\r\n\r\n    May 13-20—Meetings held in the principal cities to consider\r\n      the state of affairs, recommended the assembly of a\r\n      Continental Congress. This body was appointed in all the\r\n      provinces but Georgia. There were fifty-three delegates.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 4—These assemble at Philadelphia, and Peyton Randolph,\r\n      of Virginia, is chosen President. They publish a “Declaration\r\n      of Colonial Rights.” They agree on fourteen articles as the\r\n      basis of an “American Association” to support these rights.\r\n      This body was henceforth the real government, all their\r\n      directions being obeyed by the people. They completed the\r\n      organization of the Union and took preliminary measures for\r\n      defense in case of attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n1775.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 1—Lord Chatham introduced a bill in Parliament which\r\n      might have accommodated all differences, but it was treated\r\n      with great discourtesy. Parliament determines to humble and\r\n      subdue the colonies.\r\n\r\n    April 19—Battle of Lexington. General Gage sends eight\r\n      hundred British troops to destroy some colonial military\r\n      stores at Concord, twenty miles from Boston. The “minute\r\n      men” assembled at Lexington, are fired on and dispersed. The\r\n      troops march to Concord, destroy the stores, and hastily\r\n      retreat before the gathering minute men, who assail them on\r\n      all sides. They would have been completely destroyed but for\r\n      a timely reinforcement at Lexington of nine hundred men and\r\n      two cannon. The loss of British killed and wounded was nearly\r\n      three hundred; of the provincials eighty-five. Boston is\r\n      immediately beleagured by some twenty thousand minute men.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—Massachusetts Legislature assembles. It sends\r\n      depositions, proving that the soldiers fired first, to\r\n      England, with an address to the English people, declaring\r\n      that they will “die or be free.” This body voted a levy of\r\n      thirteen thousand men for the protection of the colony.\r\n\r\n    May 10—The second Continental Congress assembled at\r\n      Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n      Colonels Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold surprise the\r\n      fortress of Ticonderoga, on Lake George, New York. Its small\r\n      force of three officers and forty-four privates cannot defend\r\n      it, and they surrender without fighting. Crown Point, on Lake\r\n      Champlain, is occupied without resistance.\r\n\r\n      Peyton Randolph again chosen President of Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 24—Peyton Randolph being called home, John Hancock, of\r\n      Massachusetts, is chosen President of Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne, with large British\r\n      reinforcements, arrived at Boston.\r\n\r\n    June 15—George Washington unanimously chosen\r\n      commander-in-chief of the Continental forces.\r\n\r\n    ” 17—The battle of Bunker Hill (or Breed’s Hill), near\r\n      Boston.

This act led to\r\nimmediate measures for assembling delegates, representing twelve colonies\r\nin North America (Georgia, only, was not represented), for the purpose\r\nof consultation on the measures required for the protection of colonial\r\nrights. This body, called “The Continental Congress,” assembled in\r\nPhiladelphia, September 5, 1774. It drew up a “Declaration of Colonial\r\nRights;” and, for the purpose of enforcing them, agreed to accept as\r\na basis of common action fourteen articles, known as “The American\r\nAssociation.”\r\n\r\nThis was the origin of the American Union. Though it did not assume\r\norganic political power, and its ordinances were only advisory in form,\r\nit was better obeyed than most governments. Arrangements were made for\r\nanother Congress in May following. Its day of meeting was hastened by the\r\nbattle of Lexington, and it immediately proceeded to assume the powers\r\nof a General Government, at the request of _some_ of the provincial\r\nLegislatures, and with the tacit consent of _all_. It received its\r\nauthority from its representative character; from the imperious necessity\r\nof a head to organize and direct; and from the voluntary obedience\r\nrendered to its mandates. It performed all the functions of a government\r\nuntil all prospect of reconciliation with Great Britain was lost, when,\r\nJune 11, 1776, a committee was appointed to prepare “A Declaration of\r\nIndependence.” This was adopted and signed July 4, 1776.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July, a committee of one from each State reported on the\r\nterms of confederation, and the powers of Congress; but differences of\r\nopinion, and the pressure of military affairs prevented action on it. On\r\nthe 9th of September, 1776, the name “United Colonies of America” was\r\ndiscarded for that of “United States of America.” Georgia had appointed\r\ndelegates on the 4th of July, so that there were “Thirteen United States.”\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, November 15, 1777, “Articles of Confederation and Perpetual\r\nUnion of the United States of America” were agreed to in Congress, and\r\nsent to the States for approval. Eight of the State Legislatures had\r\nratified these articles on the 9th of July, 1778; one ratified July 21st;\r\none July 24th; one November 26th, of this year; one February 22d, 1779;\r\nand the last, March 1, 1781.\r\n\r\nThis document was little more than a digest of the powers before assumed\r\nby Congress, and tacitly acknowledged by the States from the commencement\r\nof the war. This, now legal, bond had existed before as a free, though\r\nunspoken, submission to the dictates of prudence and patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis immortal state paper—“the general effusion of the soul of the\r\ncountry” at the imperiled state of liberty, and of the rights of\r\nEnglishmen—was given to the world on the 4th of July, 1776. The war of\r\nthe Revolution had been raging more than a year, and many of the leading\r\nminds of the country had been actuated by the hope that their wrongs\r\nwould be redressed, and the mother country and her colonies reconciled.\r\nThe course of events had convinced them, however, that there would be no\r\nredress, and that no reconciliation was possible other than that based on\r\na slavish surrender of rights and privileges dear to free men.\r\n\r\nAnd hence a more decided course was approved by the people, and finally\r\nadopted by their delegates in Congress, on the 2d day of July, 1776.\r\nThis resolution changed the old thirteen British colonies into free and\r\nindependent States. And now it remained to set forth the reason for this\r\nact, together with the principles that should govern this new people.\r\nBy this declaration the new Republic, as it took its place among the\r\npowers of the world, proclaimed its faith in the truth, reality, and\r\nunchangeableness of freedom and virtue. And the astonished nations, as\r\nthey read that all men are created equal, started out of their lethargy,\r\nlike those who have been exiled from childhood when they suddenly hear\r\nthe dimly remembered accents of their mother tongue.\r\n\r\n    THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n    When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for\r\n    one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected\r\n    them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth,\r\n    the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and\r\n    of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions\r\n    of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which\r\n    impel them to the separation.\r\n\r\n    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\r\n    created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\n    certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,\r\n    and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,\r\n    governments are instituted among men, deriving their just\r\n    powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any\r\n    form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the\r\n    right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute\r\n    a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and\r\n    organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most\r\n    likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed,\r\n    will dictate that governments long established should not be\r\n    changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all\r\n    experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer,\r\n    while evils are sufferable, than to right them by abolishing\r\n    the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train\r\n    of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object,\r\n    evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is\r\n    their right, it is their duty to throw off such government, and\r\n    to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been\r\n    the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the\r\n    necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems\r\n    of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain\r\n    is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having\r\n    in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over\r\n    these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid\r\n    world:\r\n\r\n    He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and\r\n    necessary for the public good.\r\n\r\n    He has forbidden his Governors to pass laws of immediate and\r\n    pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till\r\n    his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has\r\n    utterly neglected to attend to them.\r\n\r\n    He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of\r\n    large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish\r\n    the right of representation in the legislature; a right\r\n    inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.\r\n\r\n    He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r\n    uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public\r\n    records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance\r\n    with his measures.\r\n\r\n    He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing,\r\n    with manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.\r\n\r\n    He has refused, for a long time after such dissolution, to\r\n    cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers,\r\n    incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large\r\n    for their exercise; the State remaining, in the meantime,\r\n    exposed to all the danger of invasion from without, and\r\n    convulsions within.\r\n\r\n    He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States;\r\n    for that purpose, obstructing the laws for naturalization\r\n    of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their\r\n    migration hither, and raising the conditions of new\r\n    appropriations of lands.\r\n\r\n    He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing\r\n    his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.\r\n\r\n    He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure\r\n    of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n\r\n    He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither\r\n    swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their\r\n    substance.\r\n\r\n    He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies,\r\n    without the consent of our legislature.\r\n\r\n    He has affected to render the military independent of, and\r\n    superior to, the civil power.\r\n\r\n    He has combined with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction\r\n    foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\r\n    giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.\r\n\r\n    For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r\n\r\n    For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any\r\n    murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these\r\n    States:\r\n\r\n    For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:\r\n\r\n    For imposing taxes on us without our consent:\r\n\r\n    For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by\r\n    jury:\r\n\r\n    For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended\r\n    offenses:\r\n\r\n    For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring\r\n    province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and\r\n    enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example\r\n    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into\r\n    these colonies:\r\n\r\n    For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable\r\n    laws, and altering fundamentally, the powers of our government:\r\n\r\n    For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves\r\n    invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\n    He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his\r\n    protection, and waging war against us.\r\n\r\n    He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns,\r\n    and destroyed the lives of our people.\r\n\r\n    He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign\r\n    mercenaries to complete the work of death, desolation, and\r\n    tyranny, already begun, with circumstances of cruelty and\r\n    perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and\r\n    totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.\r\n\r\n    He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the\r\n    high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become\r\n    the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall\r\n    themselves by their hands.\r\n\r\n    He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\r\n    endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the\r\n    merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an\r\n    undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.\r\n\r\n    In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for\r\n    redress, in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions\r\n    have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose\r\n    character is thus marked by every act which may define a\r\n    tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\r\n\r\n    Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren.\r\n    We have warned them from time to time, of attempts made by\r\n    their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction\r\n    over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of\r\n    our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to\r\n    their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured\r\n    them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these\r\n    usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections\r\n    and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of\r\n    justice and consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the\r\n    necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we\r\n    hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.\r\n\r\n    We, therefore, the representatives of the UNITED STATES OF\r\n    AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS assembled, appealing to the\r\n    Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of our intentions,\r\n    do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of\r\n    these colonies, solemnly publish and declare: That these United\r\n    Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT\r\n    STATES; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the\r\n    British crown, and that all political connection between them\r\n    and the State of Great Britain, is, and ought to be, totally\r\n    dissolved; and that, as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have\r\n    full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances,\r\n    establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which\r\n    INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. And, for the support of\r\n    this declaration, and in a firm reliance on the protection of\r\n    DIVINE PROVIDENCE, we mutually pledge to each other our lives,\r\n    our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\r\n\r\n    The foregoing declaration was, by order of Congress, engrossed,\r\n    and signed by the following members:\r\n\r\n                                                      JOHN HANCOCK.\r\n\r\n      _New Hampshire._\r\n\r\n          JOSIAH BARTLETT,\r\n          WILLIAM WHIPPLE,\r\n          MATTHEW THORNTON.\r\n\r\n      _Rhode Island._\r\n\r\n          STEPHEN HOPKINS,\r\n          WILLIAM ELLERY.\r\n\r\n      _Connecticut._\r\n\r\n          ROGER SHERMAN,\r\n          SAMUEL HUNTINGTON,\r\n          WILLIAM WILLIAMS,\r\n          OLIVER WOLCOTT.\r\n\r\n      _New York._\r\n\r\n          WILLIAM FLOYD,\r\n          PHILIP LIVINGSTON,\r\n          FRANCIS LEWIS,\r\n          LEWIS MORRIS.\r\n\r\n      _New Jersey._\r\n\r\n          RICHARD STOCKTON,\r\n          JOHN WITHERSPOON,\r\n          FRANCIS HOPKINSON,\r\n          JOHN HART,\r\n          ABRAHAM CLARK.\r\n\r\n      _Pennsylvania._\r\n\r\n          ROBERT MORRIS,\r\n          BENJAMIN RUSH,\r\n          BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,\r\n          JOHN MORTON,\r\n          GEORGE CLYMER,\r\n          JAMES SMITH,\r\n          GEORGE TAYLOR,\r\n          JAMES WILSON,\r\n          GEORGE ROSS.\r\n\r\n      _Massachusetts Bay._\r\n\r\n          SAMUEL ADAMS,\r\n          JOHN ADAMS,\r\n          ROBERT TREAT PAINE,\r\n          ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n      _Delaware._\r\n\r\n          CÆSAR RODNEY,\r\n          GEORGE REED,\r\n          THOMAS M’KEAN.\r\n\r\n      _Maryland._\r\n\r\n          SAMUEL CHASE,\r\n          WILLIAM PACA,\r\n          THOMAS STONE,\r\n          CHARLES CARROLL, of Carrollton.\r\n\r\n      _Virginia._\r\n\r\n          GEORGE WYTHE,\r\n          RICHARD HENRY LEE,\r\n          THOMAS JEFFERSON,\r\n          BENJAMIN HARRISON,\r\n          THOMAS NELSON, JUN.,\r\n          FRANCIS LIGHTFOOT LEE,\r\n          CARTER BRAXTON.\r\n\r\n      _North Carolina._\r\n\r\n          WILLIAM HOOPER,\r\n          JOSEPH HEWES,\r\n          JOHN PENN.\r\n\r\n      _South Carolina._\r\n\r\n          EDWARD RUTLEDGE,\r\n          THOMAS HEYWOOD, JUN.,\r\n          THOMAS LYNCH, JUN.,\r\n          ARTHUR MIDDLETON.\r\n\r\n      _Georgia._\r\n\r\n          BUTTON GWINNETT,\r\n          LYMAN HALL,\r\n          GEORGE WALTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION AND PERPETUAL UNION BETWEEN THE STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To all whom these Presents shall come, We, the undersigned Delegates of\r\nthe States affixed to our names, send greeting_—Whereas, the Delegates\r\nof the United States of America, in Congress assembled, did, on the 15th\r\nday of November, in the year of our Lord 1777, and in the Second Year of\r\nthe Independence of America, agree to certain Articles of Confederation\r\nand Perpetual Union between the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts\r\nBay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia, in the words following, viz.:\r\n\r\n_Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States of New\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia._\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1. The style of this Confederacy shall be “The United States of\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\nART. 2.

The taxes for paying that\r\nproportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of the\r\nlegislatures of the several States, within the time agreed upon by the\r\nUnited States in Congress assembled.\r\n\r\nART. 9. The United States in Congress assembled shall have the sole\r\nand exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war, except\r\nin the cases mentioned in the sixth article—of sending and receiving\r\nambassadors—entering into treaties and alliances: provided that no treaty\r\nof commerce shall be made whereby the legislative power of the respective\r\nStates shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on\r\nforeigners as their own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting\r\nthe exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities\r\nwhatsoever—of establishing rules for deciding in all cases what captures\r\non land or water shall be legal, and in what manner prizes taken by land\r\nor naval forces in the service of the United States shall be divided\r\nor appropriated—of granting letters of marque and reprisal in times of\r\npeace—appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed\r\non the high seas, and establishing courts for receiving and determining\r\nfinally appeals in all cases of captures, provided that no member of\r\nCongress shall be appointed a judge of any of the said courts.\r\n\r\nThe United States in Congress assembled shall also be the last resort on\r\nappeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting, or that hereafter\r\nmay arise, between two or more States concerning boundary, jurisdiction,\r\nor any other cause whatever, which authority shall always be exercised\r\nin the manner following: Whenever the legislative or executive authority\r\nor lawful agent of any State in controversy with another shall present\r\na petition to Congress, stating the matter in question, and praying for\r\na hearing, notice thereof shall be given by order of Congress, to the\r\nlegislative or executive authority of the other State in controversy, and\r\na day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents,\r\nwho shall then be directed to appoint, by joint consent, commissioners\r\nor judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter\r\nin question; but if they cannot agree, Congress shall name three persons\r\nout of each of the United States, and from the list of such persons each\r\nparty shall alternately strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until\r\nthe number shall be reduced to thirteen, and from that number not less\r\nthan seven nor more than nine names, as Congress shall direct, shall,\r\nin the presence of Congress, be drawn out by lot, and the persons whose\r\nnames shall be so drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners\r\nor judges to hear and finally determine the controversy, so always as\r\na major part of the judges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the\r\ndetermination; and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day\r\nappointed, without showing reasons which Congress shall judge sufficient,\r\nor, being present, shall refuse to strike, the Congress shall proceed\r\nto nominate three persons out of each State, and the Secretary of\r\nCongress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the\r\njudgment and sentence of the court to be appointed, in the manner above\r\nprescribed, shall be final and conclusive; and if any of the parties\r\nshall refuse to submit to the authority of such court, or to appear or\r\ndefend their claim or cause, the court shall, nevertheless, proceed to\r\npronounce sentence or judgment, which shall in like manner be final and\r\ndecisive, the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either\r\ncase transmitted to Congress and lodged among the acts of Congress for\r\nthe security of the parties concerned: provided that every commissioner,\r\nbefore he sits in judgment, shall take an oath, to be administered by\r\none of the judges of the Supreme or Superior Court of the State where\r\nthe cause shall be tried, “well and truly to hear and determine the\r\nmatter in question, according to the best of his judgment, without favor,\r\naffection, or hope of reward:” provided also that no State shall be\r\ndeprived of territory for the benefit of the United States.\r\n\r\nAll controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed under\r\ndifferent grants of two or more States, whose jurisdictions, as they may\r\nrespect such lands and the States which passed such grants, are adjusted,\r\nthe said grants, or either of them, being at the same time claimed to\r\nhave originated antecedent to such settlement of jurisdiction, shall, on\r\nthe petition of either party to the Congress of the United States, be\r\nfinally determined, as near as may be, in the same manner as is before\r\nprescribed for deciding disputes respecting territorial jurisdiction\r\nbetween different States.\r\n\r\nThe United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole\r\nexclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin\r\nstruck by their own authority, or by that of the respective States;\r\nfixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United States;\r\nregulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians not\r\nmembers of any of the States—provided that the legislative right of any\r\nState within its own limits be not infringed or violated; establishing\r\nor regulating post offices from one State to another, throughout all the\r\nUnited States, and exacting such postage on the papers passing through\r\nthe same as may be requisite to defray the expenses of the said office;\r\nappointing all officers of the land forces in the service of the United\r\nStates, except regimental officers; appointing all the officers of the\r\nnaval forces, and commissioning all officers whatever in the service of\r\nthe United States; making rules for the government and regulation of the\r\nsaid land and naval forces, and directing their operations.\r\n\r\nThe United States in Congress assembled shall have authority to appoint\r\na committee to sit in the recess of Congress, to be denominated “A\r\nCommittee of the States,” and to consist of one delegate from each\r\nState, and to appoint such other committees and civil officers as may be\r\nnecessary for managing the general affairs of the United States under\r\ntheir direction; to appoint one of their number to preside—provided that\r\nno person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than one\r\nyear in any term of three years; to ascertain the necessary sums of money\r\nto be raised for the service of the United States, and to appropriate\r\nand apply the same for defraying the public expenses; to borrow money\r\nor emit bills on the credit of the United States, transmitting every\r\nhalf year to the respective States an account of the sums of money so\r\nborrowed or emitted; to build and equip a navy; to agree upon the number\r\nof land forces, and to make requisitions from each State for its quota,\r\nin proportion to the number of white inhabitants in such State, which\r\nrequisition shall be binding; and thereupon the legislatures of each\r\nState shall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men, and clothe,\r\narm and equip them in a soldierlike manner, at the expense of the United\r\nStates; and the officers and men so clothed, armed, and equipped, shall\r\nmarch to the place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United\r\nStates in Congress assembled; but if the United States in Congress\r\nassembled shall, on consideration of circumstances, judge proper that any\r\nState should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number than its\r\nquota, and that any other State should raise a greater number of men than\r\nthe quota thereof, such extra number shall be raised, officered, clothed,\r\narmed and equipped in the same manner as the quota of such State, unless\r\nthe legislature of such State shall judge that such extra number cannot\r\nbe safely spared out of the same, in which case they shall raise,\r\nofficer, clothe, arm and equip as many of such extra number as they judge\r\ncan be safely spared; and the officers and men so clothed, armed and\r\nequipped shall march to the place appointed, and within the time agreed\r\non by the United States in Congress assembled.\r\n\r\nThe United States in Congress assembled shall never engage in a war, nor\r\ngrant letters of marque and reprisal in time of peace, nor enter into any\r\ntreaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate the value thereof,\r\nnor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for the defense and welfare\r\nof the United States, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor borrow money on\r\nthe credit of the United States, nor appropriate money, nor agree upon\r\nthe number of vessels of war to be built or purchased, or the number of\r\nland or sea forces to be raised, nor appoint a commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy or navy, unless nine States assent to the same; nor shall a question\r\non any other point, except for adjourning from day to day, be determined\r\nunless by the votes of a majority of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States shall have power to adjourn to any\r\ntime within the year, and to any place within the United States, so that\r\nno period of adjournment be for a longer duration than the space of six\r\nmonths; and shall publish the journal of their proceedings monthly,\r\nexcept such parts thereof relating to treaties, alliances, or military\r\noperations, as in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays\r\nof the delegates of each State on any question shall be entered on the\r\njournal when it is desired by any delegate; and the delegates of a State,\r\nor any of them, at his or their request, shall be furnished with a\r\ntranscript of the said journal, except such parts as are above excepted,\r\nto lay before the legislatures of the several States.\r\n\r\nART. 10. The committee of the States, or any nine of them, shall be\r\nauthorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers\r\nof Congress as the United States in Congress assembled, by the consent\r\nof nine States, shall, from time to time, think expedient to vest them\r\nwith; provided that no power, be delegated to the said committee, for the\r\nexercise of which, by the Articles of Confederation, the voice of nine\r\nStates, in the Congress of the United States assembled is requisite.\r\n\r\nART. 11. Canada, acceding to this confederation and joining in the\r\nmeasures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to\r\nall the advantages of, this union; but no other colony shall be admitted\r\ninto the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.\r\n\r\nART. 12. All bills of credit emitted, moneys borrowed, and debts\r\ncontracted by or under the authority of Congress, before the assembling\r\nof the United States, in pursuance of the present confederation, shall be\r\ndeemed and considered as a charge against the United States, for payment\r\nand satisfaction whereof, the said United States and the public faith are\r\nsolemnly pledged.\r\n\r\nART. 13. Every State shall abide by the determinations of the\r\nUnited States in Congress assembled on all questions which, by this\r\nconfederation, are submitted to them. And the articles of this\r\nconfederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the union\r\nshall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be\r\nmade in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress\r\nof the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of\r\nevery State.\r\n\r\n_And whereas_, It hath pleased the Great Governor of the World to\r\nincline the hearts of the legislatures we respectively represent in\r\nCongress to approve of and to authorize us to ratify the said Articles\r\nof Confederation and perpetual union: Know ye that we, the undersigned\r\ndelegates, by virtue of the power and authority to us given for that\r\npurpose, do by these presents, in the name and in behalf of our\r\nrespective constituents, fully and entirely ratify and confirm each and\r\nevery of the said Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, and all\r\nand singular the matters and things therein contained. And we do further\r\nsolemnly plight and engage the faith of our respective constituents,\r\nthat they shall abide by the determinations of the United States in\r\nCongress assembled on all questions which, by the said confederation,\r\nare submitted to them; and that the articles thereof shall be inviolably\r\nobserved by the States we respectively represent, and that the union\r\nshall be perpetual. In witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands in\r\nCongress. Done at Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, the ninth\r\nday of July, in the year of our Lord 1778, and in the third year of the\r\nIndependence of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY WAR FROM 1776 TO 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n    July 4—The British troops had been driven from Boston\r\n      about the middle of March. From that time to the last of\r\n      June no British soldiers had a foothold anywhere in the\r\n      thirteen colonies. England had been preparing, however. The\r\n      aid of German troops had been secured, and an expedition\r\n      made ready. It was a fortunate respite, after a great\r\n      success, and finding the mother country inexorable in her\r\n      determination, in which to carefully consider the situation.\r\n      That consideration had produced that noble protest of freemen\r\n      against tyranny—The Declaration of Independence. It now\r\n      remained to make it good by force of arms against a rich and\r\n      powerful European empire, which was summoning its energies\r\n      to the work of subjugation. On the 28th of June General Howe\r\n      landed the late garrison of Boston, and other troops, on\r\n      Staten Island.\r\n\r\n    July 12—Lord Howe arrived from England; Gen. Clinton returned\r\n      from his repulse at Fort Moultrie, several Hessian regiments\r\n      soon after arrived, and the British force amounted to 24,000;\r\n      Gen. Carleton was near Lake Champlain with 13,000 men. The\r\n      forces under Washington did not amount to half as many, but\r\n      the British had a salutary respect for American prowess, and\r\n      were laboring to win the American leaders back by promises of\r\n      pardon.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 27—The battle of Long Island. The Americans, 9,000\r\n      strong, are attacked by the British, 15,000 strong. The\r\n      Americans are worsted, but hold their intrenched camp.\r\n      Washington silently and safely retreats during the night.\r\n      The Americans lost 1,600 in killed, wounded and prisoners.\r\n      British killed and wounded, 400.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 1—General Howe sends General Sullivan (American, taken\r\n      prisoner in the late battle), to Congress to discuss a\r\n      compromise of the dispute between England and the Colonies.\r\n      Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Edward Rutledge, are\r\n      appointed to meet English commissioners. They meet on Staten\r\n      Island, but can make no arrangements.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 15—British army takes possession of New York. General\r\n      Washington’s army being largely made up of militia, which\r\n      come and go, he adopts “The Fabian Policy” of avoiding\r\n      general engagements, keeping the enemy harrassed and in\r\n      constant movement. This saved the American cause.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 26—Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee\r\n      appointed commissioners to France.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 1—Henry Laurens, of South Carolina, chosen President of\r\n      Congress.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 16—Fort Washington, at the north end of Manhattan\r\n      Island, assaulted by the British, in force. The fort was\r\n      taken with 2,000 prisoners. The British loss was 1,200 in\r\n      killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 18—Americans evacuate Fort Lee, on the Hudson, above New\r\n      York.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 28—Washington retreats across the Delaware into\r\n      Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 7—Gen. Lee disobeys the instructions of Washington and\r\n      is taken prisoner by the British.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 8—A British naval force takes possession of Newport,\r\n      Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 12—The British army being stationed along the Delaware,\r\n      in New Jersey, Congress adjourns from Philadelphia to\r\n      Baltimore.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 26-27—Washington suddenly crosses the Delaware and\r\n      surprises Trenton. He captures 1,000 Hessians and six cannon,\r\n      with a loss of four killed. In this year about 350 British\r\n      merchant vessels had been taken by Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n1777.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 2—Washington having re-occupied Trenton, Lord Cornwallis\r\n      marches a strong force to attack him.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 3—The American army silently retreat in the night and\r\n      capture Princeton, with 300 prisoners. British loss in killed\r\n      and wounded, 100. American loss about the same. General\r\n      Mercer killed.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 6—Letters of Marque and Reprisal granted by the English\r\n      against American commerce.\r\n\r\n    March 4—Congress returns to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    ” 23—American stores destroyed at Peekskill, New York.\r\n\r\n    April 26—Danbury, Connecticut, burned by the British.\r\n\r\n    May 24—This outrage is retaliated by Colonel Meigs, of\r\n      Connecticut, who lands on Long Island with 200 men, destroys\r\n      twelve vessels, large quantities of provision and forage,\r\n      takes ninety prisoners, and retreats without the loss of a\r\n      man.\r\n\r\n    May 27—Button Gwinnett, of Georgia, one of the signers of the\r\n      Declaration of Independence, is killed in a duel.\r\n\r\n    June 22—Gen. Howe evacuates New Brunswick, New Jersey, and\r\n      retires in order to draw Washington into a battle. Washington\r\n      advances till he penetrates the design of the enemy, when he\r\n      retreats to a strong position and foils the British.\r\n\r\n    June 30—General Howe embarks 16,000 troops at Staten Island\r\n      for Philadelphia. About this time the French Marquis De\r\n      Lafayette, a youth of nineteen, arrived in America, with\r\n      twelve other foreign officers, to aid the American cause.\r\n\r\n    July 1—British Gen. Burgoyne appears before Fort Ticonderoga.\r\n\r\n    ” 5—Americans evacuate Ticonderoga.\r\n\r\n    ” 7—Americans retreating from Ticonderoga, are defeated at\r\n      Hubbardton.\r\n\r\n    ” 7—United States frigate Hancock captured by three English\r\n      vessels.\r\n\r\n    ” 29—Burgoyne’s army, constantly victorious, reaches the\r\n      Hudson.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 3—British Gen. St. Leger invests Fort Stanwix (Utica,\r\n      New York).\r\n\r\n    ” 6—American Gen. Herkimer defeated near Fort Stanwix.\r\n      American loss 400. Gen. Herkimer killed.\r\n\r\n    ” 16—Battle of Bennington, Vermont. A victory for the “Green\r\n      Mountain Boys.” British lost 200 killed, 600 prisoners, 1,000\r\n      stand of arms, 1,000 swords, and four cannon. American loss\r\n      fourteen killed and forty-two wounded. This turned the tide\r\n      against Burgoyne.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—Gen. Arnold raises the siege of Fort Stanwix. St. Leger\r\n      loses his artillery, tents, and stores.\r\n\r\n    ” 11—Washington’s army defeated by the British at the battle\r\n      of the Brandywine, near Wilmington, Delaware. Washington\r\n      retreats in good order.\r\n\r\n    ” 18—Congress adjourns from Philadelphia to Lancaster,\r\n      Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—Battle of Stillwater between Gates, American, and Gen.\r\n      Burgoyne. Burgoyne held the field, but lost 500 men; Gates\r\n      300.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 16—Washington advances across the Schuylkill to attack\r\n      the British, when a violent storm stops the conflict. The\r\n      arms of the Americans are rendered unserviceable by the rain.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—Gen. Wayne, surprised at Paoli, retreats with loss of\r\n      300 men.\r\n\r\n    ” 26—The British enter Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 4—Battle of Germantown. Washington, with an inferior\r\n      army, is again defeated. British loss 600. American loss over\r\n      1,000.\r\n\r\n    ” 7—Battle of Saratoga. Burgoyne is defeated, and part of\r\n      his camp with stores and ammunition, much needed by the\r\n      Americans, captured. British loss 400. They retreated in the\r\n      night.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—Kingston, New York, burned by the British. They had taken\r\n      forts Clinton and Montgomery, defending the river below,\r\n      October 6th. This was an effort to aid Burgoyne, but it\r\n      failed, being too late, and they retreated down the river.\r\n\r\n    ” 17—Gen. Burgoyne surrenders his whole army to Gen. Gates.\r\n      The prisoners amounted to 5,647. Burgoyne had lost about\r\n      4,000 since his capture of Ticonderoga. Thirty-five brass\r\n      field-pieces and 5,000 stand of arms fell into the hands\r\n      of the Americans. Washington, as commander-in-chief, had\r\n      diminished his own army till it was much inferior to the\r\n      British he was facing, to secure the success of the northern\r\n      army against Burgoyne. This was the turning point of the war.\r\n      Its immediate result was a treaty of alliance with France.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—Count Donop, with 1,200 Hessians, attacks the American\r\n      fort at Red Bank, below Philadelphia, and is repulsed by\r\n      Colonel Green with 400 men. Donop is killed, and the British\r\n      retire with a loss of 500 men and two vessels of war.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 15—“The Articles of Confederation” adopted by Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 16-18—Americans abandon Mud Island, and Fort Mercer, below\r\n      Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 11—Washington establishes his army in winter quarters\r\n      at Valley Forge. During this year American prisoners were\r\n      treated with great cruelty at New York. General Gates, who\r\n      had really succeeded in capturing Burgoyne only by the aid of\r\n      Generals Schuyler and Arnold, intrigues against Washington.\r\n      When this became known the general indignation killed the\r\n      scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n1778.\r\n\r\nThe American cause was really gained by the war of the previous year. The\r\nAmericans were so far unanimous, and so spirited, that the British had\r\nnot been able to get a permanent hold on any part of the country, save\r\nwhat was occupied by their armies in force.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 30—A treaty of alliance is made with France.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—The American frigate Alfred, of twenty guns, captured\r\n      by two English vessels of war.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—The American Minister presented at the French Court.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 18—Count d’Estaing leaves Toulon, France, with a fleet\r\n      to aid the Americans in the war.\r\n\r\n    Jun. 12—Philip Livingston, of New York, one of the signers of\r\n      the Declaration of Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    ” 17—The British Parliament having appointed three\r\n      Commissioners, the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Auckland, and\r\n      Governor Johnstone, to treat for peace with the colonies,\r\n      on the basis of granting everything they had asked, except\r\n      independence, Congress replies, refusing all intercourse\r\n      unless the independence of the States were first recognized,\r\n      and the English army withdrawn. Two years before, this\r\n      would have been eagerly accepted. England had lost, at the\r\n      beginning of this year, twenty thousand men, and 550 vessels,\r\n      taken by American cruisers, worth twelve million dollars, and\r\n      had spent one hundred million dollars on military armaments\r\n      in America.\r\n\r\n    ” 18—The English, afraid of being blockaded in the Delaware\r\n      river, by the French fleet, evacuate Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    Jun. 28—Battle of Morristown; Washington wins. The British\r\n      retreat in the night. Lord Cornwallis commanded.\r\n\r\n    July 4-5—“The massacre of Wyoming” by the Indians, under Tory\r\n      influence. About 400 troops, and most of the inhabitants\r\n      killed.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 15—General Sullivan besieges the English in Newport.\r\n\r\n    ” 28-29—Count d’Estaing, who was to have supported General\r\n      Sullivan by a naval attack on Newport, Rhode Island, having\r\n      suffered severe loss in an engagement with the English fleet,\r\n      and withdrawn to Boston to refit, Sullivan retires, but is\r\n      attacked by the British. He repulses them, and retreats from\r\n      Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 29—Savannah, Geo., taken by the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n1779.\r\n\r\nThe British direct their main efforts, this year, to the Southern States,\r\nand overrun Georgia and part of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 3—American force under Ashe surprised by\r\n      Brigadier-General Prevost; loss 1,600.\r\n\r\n    May 2—Verplank’s Point, on the Hudson river, surrenders to\r\n      British forces.\r\n\r\n    ” 10—Norfolk and Portsmouth taken and partially burned by\r\n      the British. Stony Point, on the Hudson, evacuated by the\r\n      Americans and occupied by the British.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—Prevost makes an attempt on Charleston, South Carolina,\r\n      but fails.\r\n\r\n    June 6—Patrick Henry, a distinguished patriot, died, aged 63.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—Gen. Lincoln, American, attacks Prevost, at Stone River.\r\n      He is repulsed, and Prevost retires to Georgia.\r\n\r\n    July 4—Governor Tryon makes a descent, in Connecticut,\r\n      destroys the shipping at New Haven, and burns Fairfield,\r\n      Norwalk, and Greenwich.

Greene was worsted, but\r\n      retreated in quiet. His loss was 400; Cornwallis’, 500. So\r\n      heavy a loss was as bad as a defeat to Cornwallis.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 25—Battle of Hobkirks Hill.

Burgoyne.\r\n\r\n\r\n1782.\r\n\r\nThe war was now practically concluded. The finances of the United States,\r\nthe sad condition of which had so much interfered with the collection and\r\nsupport of strong and well-disciplined armies, had been lately supported\r\nby loans from France and Holland. The Americans were stronger than ever,\r\nthe British could not hold possession even of the Southern States, where\r\nthere were more royalist inhabitants than further north; and the aid of\r\nFrance on the sea really made the Americans invincible. England could no\r\nlonger raise the money or the troops to continue the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe year 1782 was mostly spent in negotiations. The difficulties of\r\narranging the terms were great; and the boundaries of the new Government\r\nwere a subject of much dispute.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—Resolutions were passed in the English Parliament, in\r\n      favor of peace.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 19—Holland acknowledges American independence.\r\n\r\n    July 11—Savannah, Georgia, evacuated by the British, and\r\n      occupied by General Wayne. The British carried off 5,000\r\n      negroes. Great discontent arose in the army in regard to\r\n      pay, and only the great influence of Washington, and the\r\n      wise moderation of American statesmen in Congress, prevented\r\n      serious outbreaks.\r\n\r\n      Franklin, Adams, Jay, and Laurens, were the American\r\n      Commissioners who arranged terms of peace.\r\n\r\n      Various Indian wars raged on the frontiers during this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1783.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 20—The preliminary treaty, providing for the cessation\r\n      of hostilities between England and the United States, was\r\n      signed.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 5—The Independence of the United States acknowledged by\r\n      Sweden.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 24—The Independence of the United States acknowledged by\r\n      Denmark.

Toward the close of the war\r\nthey had adopted Articles of Confederation. These were soon found to\r\nbe inadequate to secure the general welfare, and without sufficient\r\nauthority to carry their measures into effect. No sufficient means were\r\nsupplied by them to maintain the public credit, and all the interests of\r\nthe country languished.\r\n\r\nThey formed the Bond of Union for six years or more, and served an\r\nexcellent purpose in calling the attention of statesmen and the people to\r\nthe points most important in the constitution of a vigorous government.\r\nIt was the trial essay, and the intelligence of the leading men of that\r\nperiod turned it to great profit.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 the legislature of Virginia proposed a convention of\r\ncommissioners to improve the condition of trade and commerce. These\r\ncommissioners met and recommended Congress to call a General Convention\r\nto revise the Articles of Confederation. This convention assembled in\r\nMay, 1787, in Philadelphia; all the States except Rhode Island being\r\nrepresented. George Washington was chosen president. The members of\r\nthis convention were the representatives of a people who had proved\r\ntheir firmness and attachment to liberty during a long war and against\r\ngreat difficulties. The delegates were men of tried patriotism, and the\r\nevent has proved their wise and discriminating foresight. The system\r\nof government they planned is their most eloquent eulogy. The severe\r\ntests to which the expansion of the nation and the conflicts of sections\r\nand interests have subjected it, have served only the more fully to\r\nreveal how perfectly they comprehended the principles of a republican\r\ngovernment, and their singular skill in arrangement. They combined the\r\nutmost vigor with the greatest security of rights. It is a glorious\r\nmonument to their political insight. They, themselves, were not aware how\r\nprofound was the wisdom, how complete the adaptation of its provisions.\r\nThey signed it with many misgivings, on the 17th of September, 1787,\r\nafter four months of diligent labor. It was then presented to the people\r\nfor their ratification. They were cautious and prudent in those times,\r\nand could not appreciate as we do now, the extreme value of the work that\r\nhad been accomplished. Time was required to bring out its excellences,\r\nand show how few and comparatively unimportant were its defects. It was\r\nexamined with careful attention, and finally adopted as follows:\r\n\r\n  By Convention of Delaware          7th December, 1787\r\n   ”       ”       Pennsylvania     12th December, 1787\r\n   ”       ”       New Jersey       18th December, 1787\r\n   ”       ”       Georgia             2d January, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       Connecticut        9th January, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       Massachusetts     6th February, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       Maryland            28th April, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       South Carolina         3rd May, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       New Hampshire        21st June, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       Virginia             26th June, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       New York             26th July, 1788\r\n   ”       ”       North Carolina   21st November, 1789\r\n   ”       ”       Rhode Island          29th May, 1790\r\n\r\nAs shown above, two years passed before it was finally ratified by all\r\nthe States. Both the delay and the final unanimity in its acceptance,\r\ngiving testimony to the prudence and thoughtfulness of the people.\r\n\r\nElectors of President and Vice-President were chosen in the winter of\r\n1788-1789. March 4th had been appointed as the time for the government\r\nto go into operation, but a delay in assembling the members of Congress\r\ndeferred the inauguration of Washington, as first President, until\r\nApril 30th. Congress immediately organized the new government, and, in\r\nconjunction with the President, appointed the necessary officers. Some\r\nminor provisions were added or changed by the first Congress in the\r\nmanner provided by the Constitution itself, that is, by a two-thirds vote\r\nin both Houses, and ratification by three-fourths of the States.\r\n\r\nTen amendments were made at this time. The eleventh amendment was added\r\nin 1794. The twelfth in 1803. The thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth\r\namendments have been added since 1863.\r\n\r\nA resolution to amend is passed by the requisite majorities in both\r\nHouses, sent to the legislatures of the States, and, when three-fourths\r\nof them have approved it, the Secretary of State causes the resolution\r\nand amendment to be published in all the States and Territories, and it\r\nbecomes valid as part of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nContaining the wisest provisions of English law, it rejects all that is\r\nnot in harmony with our circumstances, and our fundamental doctrine that\r\nall men have equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\r\nThis it keeps continually in view, and, by the sense of dignity and worth\r\nwhich it tends to promote in the humblest man, gradually educates him up\r\nto the standard necessary for a free citizen, and, by its respect for the\r\nrights of all, tends to induce in each the same disposition.\r\n\r\nThe wisest men of the Republic, by infusing into this document their own\r\nself-respect, and respect for others, gave tone and direction to all the\r\nfuture. Their own _characters_ were so far imparted to their work as to\r\nexert a salutary influence on the destiny of the people whose fundamental\r\nlaw they compiled.\r\n\r\nThis document is the law of the land, obliging the highest to obedience,\r\nto justice, and right, and raising the lowest to an equal share in its\r\npolitical privileges, and to its vigorous protection. Consequently\r\na steady improvement in these respects has marked the growth of the\r\ncountry, and the benign influence of this respect for _man_ and his\r\n_rights_ has gone forth from the American Republic as a Regenerator among\r\nthe nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND ITS AMENDMENTS.\r\n\r\nWe, the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the\r\ncommon defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings\r\nof liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nCONSTITUTION for the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.

No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress,\r\nor elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil\r\nor military, under the United States or under any State, who, having\r\npreviously taken an oath as a Member of Congress, or as an officer of\r\nthe United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an\r\nexecutive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion\r\nagainst the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\r\nBut Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each house, remove such\r\ndisability.\r\n\r\nSEC. 4.

Y., January 11th, 1785.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1789, the present Constitution, which had been\r\nadopted by a convention and ratified by the requisite number of States,\r\nwent into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan of this part of our work requires us to give a complete view of\r\nthe government of the United States, and in such detail as to be adequate\r\nto all the purposes of the citizen and the student who wish to understand\r\nits structure and modes of working. It will be found, we think, a clear,\r\nconcise, and complete account of what it is indispensable to the American\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nThere are three branches, each independent, having its sphere of general\r\naction entirely distinct, and clearly defined by the Constitution;\r\nyet working in harmony with the others, and locking in, so to speak,\r\nwith them at special points, like the cogs of a system of wheels.\r\nThe adjustment was more perfect than the authors of the Constitution\r\nthemselves believed; probably because the spirit of the whole was in\r\nharmony with the people whose interests it was designed to guard.\r\n\r\nThese three branches are the Legislative, the Executive, and the\r\nJudicial. All the institutions or general subdivisions of each are given\r\nin connection, with such explanations and data as they seem to require.\r\nWe commence with the Executive, as being most immediately in contact\r\nwith the people at large, having a wider field, and a larger number of\r\ndistinct organizations and agents. This branch exhausted, we present\r\nthe Legislative, and finally the Judicial, closing with such matters as\r\nbelong to the government as a whole.\r\n\r\nNo human government is perfect, neither can exact and equal justice\r\nbe done in every case by human laws. But the scope and design of our\r\nlegislation and jurisprudence is to dispense justice to all, to place\r\nall on an equality before the laws, and to give the same rights to the\r\nrich and to the poor. No privileged class is known to our laws, and the\r\nlowest may aspire to the highest places of distinction and honor; many\r\nhave done so, and have reached the most exalted positions. The fullest\r\nreligious liberty is granted to all; every man may worship as he pleases,\r\nwhen and where he pleases, without molestation or fear. He is not, as in\r\nmany other countries, taxed to support a church established by law. He\r\nmay pay for religious purposes as much or as little as he pleases, and to\r\nany church he prefers, or he may pay nothing, and no one can call him to\r\naccount or use any compulsion whatever in this matter.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen has a vote for the choice of his rulers, and through his\r\nrepresentatives a voice in making the laws by which he is governed.\r\n\r\nAs to his business or calling, he may do that which best suits his\r\ninterests or his tastes. He may go when or where he desires, he may stay\r\nin the country or leave it without restraint or hindrance; in short, he\r\nmay do whatsoever seemeth good to him, provided he does not infringe on\r\nthe rights of others.\r\n\r\nTo this liberty, to these equal rights, privileges, and advantages do we\r\nattribute our rapid growth and power. The advantages and benefits of so\r\nwise, so liberal, and so beneficent a government are not unknown to the\r\npeople of other countries where they do not enjoy so much freedom; and\r\nthis accounts for the wonderful immigration to the United States from\r\nnearly every country in Europe. This flow has continued for more than\r\nthree-quarters of a century, and is still unabated. It has added many\r\nmillions to the natural increase of our population, while very few of\r\nour own people ever leave their own country with the hope of bettering\r\ntheir condition, or of finding a government under which they can enjoy\r\nmore liberty or better protection. To gain a clearer conception of the\r\nintimate connection between a good government and the prosperity of the\r\ncountry, let us, for example, place Mexico in contrast with the United\r\nStates. Mexico was settled long before the United States, and in climate\r\nand mineral wealth has the advantage of us; yet the ever unsettled\r\ncondition of its government, together with intolerance of any but the\r\nCatholic religion, has prevented any increase of population or any\r\nadvancement in anything which gives a nation respectability, greatness,\r\nor power.\r\n\r\nLet us draw another contrast by considering Ireland. An oppressive\r\ngovernment has diminished the population, prevented any advancement, and\r\nimpoverished the country. We might draw many such contrasts between the\r\nUnited States and other countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South\r\nAmerica, which would convince any one who has the power to trace causes\r\nto effects, and effects to causes, that a just and liberal government is\r\nan essential condition upon which the prosperity of any country depends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Congress legislates, or enacts laws; the officers of the Supreme Court\r\ndecide whether those laws are in conformity with the Constitution; but\r\nthe real ruler, the actual possessor of power, is the President. In the\r\nlanguage of the first section of the second article of the Constitution,\r\n“The executive powers of the government shall be vested in a President\r\nof the United States of America.” The other branches of the government\r\ndecide _what_ is to be done, and what is constitutionally legal, and the\r\nPresident is the agent. He executes, or puts in actual operation, the\r\nmeasures determined on by them. Should he attempt to do anything not\r\nso prescribed, or to do anything in an improper manner, contrary to or\r\ndifferent from the manner prescribed by the law, he may be impeached and\r\nremoved, and all the subordinate officers and agents of the government\r\nreleased from the obligation to obey him.\r\n\r\n2. The other branches are composed of many persons. He has no associate.\r\nThe execution of the law requires vigor and decision, such as can be\r\nfound only in a single mind and will. All history shows that there is\r\nconstant danger of power being misused, whether one, two, or any number\r\nof men are the depositaries of it; but one man is much better than two\r\nor more, when vigor and promptness are required. All the securities\r\nand checks that could be applied without embarrassing his necessary\r\nfreedom of action have been provided. They can not, indeed, supply the\r\nwant of judgment and uprightness, and so no absolute security against\r\nmismanagement can exist; but the danger may be in large part avoided by\r\ncarefulness in the selection of the man who is to wield the whole power\r\nof a great nation.\r\n\r\nIt is an office of great dignity, responsibility, and power, and requires\r\na man of great ability and probity to properly fill it.\r\n\r\n3. The President is elected for four years, and may be reëlected if the\r\npeople see fit. Several times in our history the President has been once\r\nreëlected, and so held the office for eight years; but none have been\r\ntwice reëlected, though there is no law against it. The term commences\r\nand terminates on the fourth day of March. He is elected by the people,\r\nevery voter having an equal influence in the choice; but it is not done\r\nby voting for him directly, but by voting first for men called electors,\r\nwho cast their votes according to the wish of the people. This system we\r\nshall hereafter examine.\r\n\r\n4. A Vice-President is elected at the same time and in the same way, who,\r\nin case of the President’s death, removal, resignation, or inability\r\nto discharge the duties of his office, becomes acting President during\r\nthe remainder of his term, or while the disability continues. The\r\nfirst Congress passed a law giving the President a salary of $25,000\r\nper annum, with the use of a furnished house, and it remained the same\r\nuntil 1873, when it was raised to $50,000 per year. He is forbidden by\r\nthe Constitution to receive any other public income during his term of\r\noffice, nor is he at liberty to accept presents from any foreign power.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the duties of his office he is required to take an\r\noath “to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates,” to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\n5. It is required that he shall be a native-born citizen of the United\r\nStates, that he shall have been fourteen years a resident in the United\r\nStates, and that he shall not be less than thirty-five years of age;\r\nwhich are designed to insure his attachment to American interests, his\r\nthorough acquaintance with American affairs, and the full maturity of his\r\nmind and character.\r\n\r\n6. It is his duty to appoint such officers in every department of the\r\npublic service as are not otherwise provided for. He usually sends the\r\nnomination to the Senate for their approval or consent, and when that\r\nis given appoints them by commission, signed with his name, to the\r\noffice. In this manner he nominates the Justices of the Supreme Court,\r\nambassadors, resident ministers, chargé-d’affaires, consuls, and other\r\nrepresentatives of the government abroad, all the Heads of Executive\r\nDepartments, and the more important subordinate officers of each\r\ndepartment. When the Senate is not in session he may appoint all these\r\ndirectly, to serve until it meets again. The clerks and minor officers\r\nare usually appointed by Heads of Departments. In all other cases the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate are required before the appointment and\r\ncommission can be legal.\r\n\r\n7. It is his duty to make treaties with Foreign Powers, but these require\r\nconfirmation by two-thirds of the Senate to be valid. He receives the\r\nRepresentatives of Foreign Powers, and superintends all diplomatic\r\nintercourse with them and with our own Representatives abroad.\r\n\r\nHe is commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and must sign the\r\ncommissions of all the officers in each. He may grant reprieves and\r\npardons at his discretion, except in cases of impeachment, and he is\r\nrequired to approve and sign the laws passed by Congress before they can\r\ntake effect. If he does not approve a law he “vetoes” it by returning\r\nit to Congress, with his reasons for not signing it. If that body\r\nreconsiders it and reënacts it by a two-thirds vote of each house, it may\r\nbecome a law without his signature.\r\n\r\n8. He may call extra sessions of Congress for special reasons, and may\r\nadjourn it in case of disagreement between the two houses as to the\r\ntime of adjournment. It is his duty to give information to Congress, at\r\nthe commencement of each session, of the state of the country, and to\r\nrecommend to it such legislative enactments as he may judge are required.\r\nThis is called “The President’s Message,” and is looked for with much\r\ninterest in this and in foreign countries, since his position makes him\r\nintimately acquainted with every subject relating to the public welfare.\r\nWhen he considers that the occasion demands it, or when he is requested\r\nby Congress to give information on a special point, he communicates with\r\nthem by similar documents, called messages.\r\n\r\nHe may be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes, by the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and tried by the Senate, the Chief Justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court presiding over that body during the trial, and in case\r\nof conviction is removed from office.\r\n\r\n9. It will be seen that he possesses great power, and that he is almost\r\noverwhelmed by responsibilities. The members of his cabinet are his\r\nconstitutional advisers, and share more or less of this responsibility,\r\nalthough his will may override them all if he so chooses.\r\n\r\nThere are many provisions for preventing an abuse of power in the\r\nConstitution and in the laws of Congress, but all history proves that\r\nnothing but watchfulness and wisdom on the part of the people can\r\npreserve to them their rights and liberties. Power, wherever lodged, is\r\nnaturally aggressive. Fortunately the people themselves in this country\r\nare the _source_ of power, and may legally restrain its exercise in their\r\nrepresentatives and executive officers, when it threatens to become\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of all the Presidents, from Washington, the\r\nfirst, down to the present incumbent:\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington, Va., 30th April, 1789, to 4th March, 1797—seven years\r\nten months and four days.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, Mass., 4th March, 1797, to 4th March, 1801—four years.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, Va., 4th March, 1801, to 4th March, 1809—eight years.\r\n\r\nJames Madison, Va., 4th March, 1809, to 4th March, 1817—eight years.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe, Va., 4th March, 1817, to 4th March, 1825—eight years.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, Mass., 4th March, 1825, to 4th March, 1829—four years.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson, Tenn., 4th March, 1829, to 4th March, 1837—eight years.\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren, N. Y., 4th March, 1837, to 4th March, 1841—four years.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Harrison, O., 4th March, 1841, to 4th April, 1841—one month.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler, Va., 4th April, 1841, to 4th March, 1845—three years and\r\neleven months.\r\n\r\nJames K. Polk, Tenn., 4th March, 1845, to 4th March, 1849—four years.\r\n\r\nZachary Taylor, La., 4th March, 1849, to 9th July, 1850—one year four\r\nmonths and five days.\r\n\r\nMillard Fillmore, N. Y., 9th July, 1850, to 4th March, 1853—two years\r\nseven months and twenty-six days.\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce, N. H., 4th March, 1853, to 4th March, 1857—four years.\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan, Pa., 4th March, 1857, to 4th March, 1861—four years.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln, Ill., 4th March, 1861, to 15th April, 1865—four years\r\none month and ten days.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson, Tenn., 15th April, 1865, to 4th March, 1869—three years\r\nten months and twenty days.\r\n\r\nUlysses S. Grant, Ill., 4th March, 1869, to 4th March, 1877—eight years.\r\n\r\nOf these William H. Harrison died 4th April, 1841, just one month after\r\nhis inauguration. On the death of Harrison, Tyler, the Vice-President,\r\nbecame acting President. Taylor died 9th July, 1850, and Fillmore,\r\nVice-President, became acting President. Lincoln was assassinated on the\r\n14th April, 1865, one month and ten days after he was inaugurated upon\r\nhis second term, and Andrew Johnson, the Vice-President, became acting\r\nPresident—this being the third time that such an event has occurred since\r\nthe government went into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE VICE-PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis officer is elected by the people at the same time, and in the same\r\nmanner, as the President, and for the same term. He must be a native\r\ncitizen of the United States, and thirty-five years of age.\r\n\r\nHis high-sounding title would lead one who is but little acquainted with\r\nour government to think that he stands next to the President himself in\r\ndignity and power; that on his shoulders rests a large amount of the\r\nduties and responsibilities of the administration. Such, however, is not\r\nthe case. He is, in fact, nearer a cipher than any of the high officers\r\nof State. He is merely the presiding officer of the Senate, with not even\r\nthe power to vote, except in case of a tie vote in that body, when he\r\nmay give the casting vote. It is only in case of the death, resignation,\r\nimpeachment, or disability of the President to discharge his duties, that\r\nthe Vice-President becomes an officer of much power or dignity.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of all the Vice-Presidents:\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, Mass., April 30th, 1789, to March 4th, 1797—seven years, ten\r\nmonths and four days.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, Va., March 4th, 1797, to March 4th, 1801—four years.\r\n\r\nAaron Burr, N. Y., March 4th, 1801, to March 4th, 1805—four years.\r\n\r\nGeorge Clinton, N. Y., March 4th, 1805, to April 30th, 1812—seven years,\r\none month, and sixteen days.\r\n\r\nElbridge Gerry, Mass., March 4th, 1813, to November 23d, 1814—one year,\r\nseven months, and nineteen days.\r\n\r\nDaniel D. Tompkins, N. Y., March 4th, 1817, to March 4th, 1825—eight\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Calhoun, S. C., March 4th, 1825 to March 4th, 1833—eight years.\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren, N. Y., March 4th, 1833, to March 4th, 1837—four years.\r\n\r\nRichard M. Johnson, Ky., March 4th, 1837, to March 4th, 1841—four years.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler, Va., March 4th, 1841, to April 4th, 1841—one month.\r\n\r\nGeorge M. Dallas, Pa., March 4th, 1845, to March 4th, 1849—four years.\r\n\r\nMillard Fillmore, N. Y., March 4th, 1849, to July 9th, 1850—one year and\r\nfour months.\r\n\r\nWilliam R. King, Ala.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Breckenridge, Ky., March 4th, 1857, to March 4th, 1861—four years.\r\n\r\nHannibal Hamlin, Me., March 4th, 1861, to March 4th, 1865—four years.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson, Tenn., March 4th, 1865, to April 15th, 1865—one month and\r\neleven days.\r\n\r\nSchuyler Colfax, Ind., March 4th, 1869, to March 4th, 1873—four years.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson, Mass., March 4th, 1873, to March 4th, 1877—four years.\r\n\r\nOf these, Clinton died April 20th, 1812; from which time till March 4th,\r\n1813, the Vice-Presidency was vacant.\r\n\r\nGerry died November 23d, 1814; from which time till March 4th, 1817, the\r\nVice-Presidency was vacant.\r\n\r\nTyler became acting President upon the death of President Harrison; and\r\nuntil March 4th, 1845, the Vice-Presidency was vacant.\r\n\r\nFillmore became acting President upon the death of President Taylor, July\r\n9th, 1850; and until March 4th, 1853, the Vice-Presidency was vacant.\r\n\r\nKing was elected with President Pierce, in 1852, but died April 18th,\r\n1853. He never took his seat, and the Vice-Presidency was vacant till\r\nMarch 4th, 1857.\r\n\r\nJohnson became acting President upon the death of President Lincoln,\r\nApril 15th, 1865, and the Vice-Presidency again became vacant, and\r\nremained so until March 4th, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The members of the President’s Cabinet are seven in number, viz.:\r\nFive Secretaries, at the head of their respective departments, of\r\nState, Treasury, War, Navy, and Interior; and the Postmaster General,\r\nand Attorney General. It is through these departments and their various\r\nbureaus, officers, agents, and clerks, that the President performs most\r\nof the duties of his position, viz.: that of _executing_, or putting in\r\nforce, the laws of Congress. He must, therefore, necessarily take them\r\ninto his counsels, and arrange, by their assistance, the conduct of\r\npublic affairs. Each one has the affairs of his department so thoroughly\r\nsystematized that he can tell, with a little examination, the means at\r\nhis disposal for carrying into effect any special measure; and precise\r\nrecords of the whole state of the public service may, at all times, be\r\nfound in their offices.\r\n\r\n2. They are also selected for their several positions from among those\r\nregarded as the most eminent statesmen of the country, and each is\r\nsupposed to be specially adapted, by his experience, acquirements, and\r\ncapacity, for his special position, as well as in harmony with the\r\ngeneral policy adopted by the President. They are, therefore, properly,\r\nand _ex officio_ (by virtue of their office), his advisers. No one\r\nelse can tell as well as they the condition of public affairs at any\r\nparticular time, nor, in consequence, give as good advice on any special\r\nmeasure requiring such knowledge. Without their aid the President would\r\nhave few means of judging what was best, or possible, to be done at any\r\nparticular crisis. They furnish the material for his decisions, and the\r\ninstruments to execute them. They are heads of the Executive Departments,\r\nand, together with the President, who is the head of them all, bringing\r\nthem all into harmony, and under the control of a single purpose and\r\nwill, they are called the administration. They administer, or carry on,\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n3. In other countries these administrative heads are usually called\r\nMinisters, probably because they _serve_ the ruler—servant being the\r\noriginal meaning of the term minister—and are commonly chosen among\r\nthe members of the legislative bodies—perhaps because that brings the\r\ngovernment into closer sympathy with the legislators, and promotes\r\nharmony of action; but with us, no member of the Cabinet can have a\r\nseat in, or take any part in the proceedings of, Congress. Great care\r\nwas taken to keep the different branches of the government distinct\r\nand independent of each other. Each branch, and each subdivision, is\r\nkept separate, and confined to its own range of duties, being united to\r\nthe others only by its head, so that confusion and conflict might be\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n4. Each sub-department reports at stated intervals to its head, and he\r\nto the President, and through him to Congress; and at the same time they\r\npresent such suggestions and arguments for legislation in regard to their\r\nseveral departments as their knowledge, experience, and reflections may\r\nhave convinced them to be desirable. They are supposed to give their\r\nwhole time and thought to the care and improvement of their several\r\nbranches of the public service, and to be in condition to know what\r\nfurther improvement should be provided for by law, better than any one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n5. Under Washington’s administration the departments and members of\r\nCabinet were but three—of State, of the Treasury, and of War. In 1798,\r\nduring the administration of John Adams, the Department of the Navy was\r\nadded, and its Secretary took his seat in the Cabinet. It then had only\r\nfour members down to Jackson’s administration (1829 to 1837), when the\r\nPostmaster General was made a Cabinet officer, which increased the number\r\nto five. During Mr. Tyler’s administration (1841-1845) the Attorney\r\nGeneral was made a member, and the number was then six. At the close of\r\nMr. Polk’s term as President, in 1849, the Department of the Interior was\r\ncreated, and its chief given the seventh seat in the Cabinet; since which\r\ntime there has been no increase. Congress may, at their discretion, as\r\nthe country grows, and the public service with it, create other great or\r\nindependent departments requiring its representative to have a seat in\r\nthe Cabinet, that the state of the entire service may be readily known\r\nfrom the officer most familiar with each branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. As the Chief Executive of a government cannot, for want of time,\r\nattend to all the details of the business belonging to his office, he,\r\naccording to the usage of all times, appoints various officers to attend\r\nto the different branches of public business. In most countries these\r\nofficers, who are next in importance to the chief of the government, are\r\ncalled Ministers. In accordance with the practice of using plain and\r\nsimple terms which was adopted in this country at the beginning, they are\r\ncalled Secretaries. They are subordinates of the President and supposed\r\nto act in his name and under his direction.\r\n\r\n2. They are not specially named in the Constitution, but are several\r\ntimes referred to as Heads of Departments, and thus it was assumed that\r\nthere would be such offices and officers, and their appointment was\r\nprovided for. The first Congress under the Constitution organized these\r\nExecutive Departments, the President nominating and the Senate confirming\r\nthe appointment of the more responsible officers.\r\n\r\n3. The first of these in rank is called the Department of State, and its\r\nhead is named the Secretary of State. He is, by a law passed in 1853,\r\naided by an Assistant Secretary, appointed in the same manner as himself.\r\nThe numerous under officers required by the extensive business falling to\r\nthis department are appointed by the Secretary at its head.\r\n\r\n4. This Department has charge of such business as may arise between this\r\ngovernment and the governments of other countries. In most countries\r\nit is called the Department, or Ministry, of Foreign Affairs, but the\r\nterm Department of State was preferred here. The great Seal of the\r\nUnited States is in his keeping, and it is his duty to affix it to\r\nall civil commissions given to officers of the United States who are\r\nappointed by the President and Senate, or by the President alone. It\r\nis his duty, under the supervision and control of the President, to\r\nconduct the correspondence with, and give instructions to, the Foreign\r\nMinisters, Consuls, and Agents of the government abroad, to take charge\r\nof the official business and intercourse of the government with the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign governments sent to us, and to attend to such\r\nother business arising from our Foreign Relations as shall be committed\r\nto him by the President.\r\n\r\n5. It is his duty to keep in his office the original copies of all acts,\r\nresolutions, and orders of Congress. He must deliver to each Senator and\r\nRepresentative in Congress, and to the Governor of each State, a printed\r\ncopy of the same; and during the session of each Congress he must publish\r\nthe acts and resolutions passed by it in one newspaper in the District\r\nof Columbia, and in not more than two in each State and Territory of the\r\nUnited States. He must also publish in like manner all amendments of\r\nthe Constitution, and all public treaties made and ratified between the\r\nUnited States and any foreign State, Prince, or Power, or with any of the\r\nIndian tribes.\r\n\r\n6. And at the close of each session of Congress he must cause to be\r\npublished 11,000 copies in book form of all the laws, etc., as before\r\nstated; and to distribute the same as directed by law to the President\r\nand Vice-President, and to every ex-President; to all the members of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives; to all the heads of the various\r\ndepartments and bureaus; to all the Judges of the United States Courts,\r\ntheir Clerks and Marshals; to all our Foreign Ministers, Consuls, and\r\nPublic Agents; in short, to all the important officers of the government\r\nat home and abroad; in order that all who are in government employ\r\nmay know what the laws are, and what changes have been made in acts\r\nformerly existing. The remaining copies are distributed to the States and\r\nTerritories according to the number of Representatives in Congress from\r\neach of them.\r\n\r\n7. It is also made the duty of the Secretary of State to give passports\r\nto our own citizens who wish to travel in foreign countries; to cause\r\npassports to be issued by such Diplomatic or Consular officers of the\r\nUnited States as the President shall direct; to give such information to\r\nour people through the newspapers as he may from time to time receive\r\nfrom our Diplomatic and Consular agents abroad, as he may deem important\r\nto the nation, respecting our commercial interests in foreign countries,\r\nand to prepare a form of passport for the ships and vessels of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n8. In the execution of extradition treaties between us and foreign\r\ngovernments, it is lawful for the Secretary of State, under his hand and\r\nseal of office, to issue an order for the rendition of any person who\r\nhas been found guilty of crime in a foreign country, to any properly\r\nauthorized person; that such criminal may be taken out of the United\r\nStates to the country where the crime was committed.\r\n\r\n9. It will be seen that, in addition to the duties connected with our\r\nForeign Relations, he is a kind of General Secretary of the Legislative\r\nbranch of the government, which probably led to his being called\r\nSecretary of State rather than Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The highest\r\nofficer, in most other governments, under the Executive, is commonly\r\ncalled Prime Minister; but he usually has care of the general interests\r\nof the government, internal as well as external, and the term would not\r\nbe fitting to the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nOur Foreign Relations require to be managed with great wisdom and skill,\r\nsince they often involve peace and war, and the general prosperity of the\r\ncountry. It therefore requires a man of great ability, and of extensive\r\nknowledge. He is a member of the Cabinet, and one of the advisers or\r\ncounselors of the President. His appointment is for four years, or\r\nduring a Presidential term; but he may be removed by the President at\r\nany time, if he deems it advisable.\r\n\r\n10. As a matter of historical reference, we append the names of all the\r\nstatesmen who have filled this high office, commencing with the first,\r\nplacing them in the order of the dates of their appointments, together\r\nwith the States from which they came:\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARIES OF STATE.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Jefferson, Va., Sept. 26th, 1789.\r\n  Edmund Randolph, Va., Jan. 2d, 1794.\r\n  Timothy Pickering, Mass., Dec. 10th, 1795.\r\n  John Marshall, Va., May 13th, 1800.\r\n  James Madison, Va., March 5th, 1801.\r\n  Robert Smith, Md., March 6th, 1809.\r\n  James Monroe, Va., April 2d, 1811.\r\n  John Quincy Adams, Mass., March 4th, 1817.\r\n  Henry Clay, Ky., March 7th, 1825.\r\n  Martin Van Buren, N.

Nations have business with each other, as individuals have; and their\r\ngovernments employ agents to represent them and transact business in\r\ntheir name. By these means their political and commercial relations and\r\nintercourse are regulated, treaties are made, and any disputes that may\r\narise between them settled. Officers of this character have been employed\r\nfrom very early times, and by all nations. They are considered to be\r\nclothed with the authority and dignity of the government they represent,\r\nand therefore the office has ever been held in great honor, and men\r\nmost familiar with the affairs of their own nation, of most extensive\r\nknowledge, prudence, and wisdom, are supposed to be selected for so\r\neminent a service.\r\n\r\n2. By the law (or general consent) of nations ambassadors are exempt from\r\narrest, imprisonment, or prosecution. Any interference with them in this\r\nway might hinder the execution of the duties assigned them, and be a\r\ngreat damage to the public welfare, and an offense of that kind committed\r\nagainst them is considered as a dishonor to the government whose\r\nagents they are. On the other hand they require much judgment and tact\r\nthat their conduct may not bring discredit on their government. Their\r\ninviolable character is carried so far as to exempt their servants from\r\narrest, and their property from seizure for debt. The law of Congress\r\nprotecting the Representatives of foreign governments to this country is\r\nbut a re-enactment, or acceptance, of what has been known as the Law of\r\nNations for many centuries all over the civilized world. A violation\r\nof this established usage among nations, without due atonement and\r\nsatisfaction, would be recognized as a sufficient cause for war against\r\nthe nation so offending.\r\n\r\n3. Our own foreign ministers of all grades are appointed by the\r\nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. They are\r\nnot, however, the representatives of the President, but of the government\r\nof the United States. We said of all grades, for there are grades of\r\nthese officials, different in dignity and power. They are distinguished\r\nalso by different names which indicate their rank, viz.: Ambassadors,\r\nEnvoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary, Ministers Resident,\r\nand Chargé d’Affaires.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBASSADORS.\r\n\r\n4. This title in our country has no very specific meaning. It designates,\r\nhowever, a minister of the highest grade; but does not distinguish\r\nbetween one who goes to reside in the country whither he is sent, and\r\none who is sent for some special purpose; such as that of negotiating\r\na treaty of peace, or some other particular matter with which he is\r\ncharged, and when that is accomplished returns home. In the latter case\r\nhe is frequently styled a commissioner, because he was duly authorized,\r\nand _commissioned_ by his government to act for it; but in both cases the\r\nofficer is an ambassador, for that word means a person authorized and\r\nsent to transact business for his government.\r\n\r\n\r\nENVOYS EXTRAORDINARY AND MINISTERS PLENIPOTENTIARY.\r\n\r\n5. These titles designate ministers of the highest class; but generally\r\nrefer to such as go to reside in the country where sent, and with full\r\npower to act for their government, in all matters and things of a\r\ndiplomatic character.\r\n\r\nWhere negotiations become necessary between the two nations, permanent\r\nministers of this grade are only sent to great powers—governments of the\r\nhigher class.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINISTERS RESIDENT.\r\n\r\n6. These are not considered so high in rank as those termed envoys\r\nextraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary. Yet they are clothed with\r\nnearly the same powers, but are sent to countries of less importance, and\r\nreceive less salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS.\r\n\r\n7. There are a still lower grade of ministers (if we may call them so),\r\nor government agents, who reside abroad. They are sent to look after\r\nthe interests of our government and its citizens in places of not much\r\nimportance, and where there is but little to do. They also receive but\r\nsmall pay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARGE D’AFFAIRES.\r\n\r\n8. These officials rank as the lowest grade of ministers or diplomatic\r\nofficers, and are not clothed with much authority or power, excepting\r\nwhen authorized to act in the room of a minister of higher rank, whose\r\nplace is for the time being vacant. In this case consuls have been\r\nauthorized to act in place of ministers; but not unless authorized to do\r\nso by the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARIES OF LEGATION.\r\n\r\n9. Secretaries of Legation may with propriety be noticed under the\r\ngeneral head of ministers, although they are not ministers of any\r\ngrade, but are appointed by the same powers that appoint ministers, and\r\naccompany them merely as their secretaries. In the absence of a chargé\r\nd’affaires, they are sometimes authorized to act in his place. The\r\nposition is not one of great dignity, nor is the compensation large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTREATIES—EXTRADITION TREATIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A treaty is a written contract, entered into by two nations, on some\r\nquestion of interest or intercourse between them. It is precisely of the\r\nnature of a contract between two persons when they bind themselves to do,\r\nor not to do, certain things specified in the contract. That would be a\r\ntreaty between individuals. Treaties between nations are only different\r\nin the solemn and formal manner of arranging and confirming these\r\nagreements.\r\n\r\n2. Treaties have often been of great service to the world, both in\r\nancient and modern times. By these negotiations, wars have been\r\nprevented, friendly relations maintained, and commercial intercourse\r\nkept up, advantageously to both parties. Treaties may be negotiated by\r\nany persons properly authorized by their governments to do so; and any\r\ngovernment may authorize such persons as they see fit, to perform these\r\nimportant acts. In many cases the ordinary ministers who represent their\r\ngovernments to other governments, negotiate ordinary treaties. But in\r\ncases where something of an extraordinary character is to be arranged,\r\nspecial ministers or commissioners are sent for this express purpose.\r\nThis was the case at the treaty of Ghent (so called from the name of the\r\nplace where the commissioners met to arrange it), in 1814; by which a\r\npeace was brought about between England and the United States, after the\r\nlast war between those powers. Special ministers, or commissioners, as\r\nthey were denominated, were appointed and sent for this very purpose. A\r\ntreaty of peace was agreed upon by the commissioners of the respective\r\ncountries, and hostilities ceased as soon as the news reached the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n3. In some cases our government has authorized its commanding generals to\r\nmake a treaty with the hostile nation. It has also given the same power\r\nto the commanders of our national vessels; and also, in a few cases, to\r\nour consuls, in countries at a great distance from home, such as China,\r\nJapan, Siam, and Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe persons authorized to negotiate a treaty, rarely act without\r\ninstructions from their government, as to the times and conditions of the\r\nproposed treaty. Much, however, must be left to the sound judgment and\r\ndiscretion of the negotiators as to the details.\r\n\r\n4. It must be borne in mind that a treaty, although mutually agreed\r\nupon by the agents of the nations concerned, is not binding upon either\r\nparty until properly ratified according to the forms of the respective\r\ngovernments interested. The modes of ratification differ in different\r\ngovernments. In ours the Constitution confers this power upon the\r\nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn absolute monarchies this power rests in the hands of the King or\r\nEmperor alone. As before stated, every government may confer the power to\r\nnegotiate a treaty upon such agents as it pleases. It also has the power\r\nto prescribe such modes of ratifying or confirming it, as it pleases.\r\n\r\n5. But when once made and approved, it becomes binding not only upon\r\nthe respective governments that made it, but upon all the citizens and\r\nsubjects of that government. It has been held in this country by our\r\ngreatest lawyers and statesmen, that the provisions of a treaty bind\r\nCongress, the President, and every citizen as much as any Constitutional\r\nprovision or act of Congress. And for this reason our treaties are\r\npublished in the papers in every State and Territory in the Union, in the\r\nsame manner, and to the same extent, as the laws of Congress.\r\n\r\n6. The violation of a treaty by either of the parties thereto, is\r\nreprehensible and criminal. It is derogatory to the character of any\r\nnation or individual that does it. It destroys the confidence of one\r\nnation in the other, leads to unfriendly feelings and acts between the\r\nparties, and may bring on a war, if satisfaction is not given. Yet such\r\nthings have been done, and evil consequences have always followed. “If\r\nyou make a bargain, stick to it,” is a common, trite, and wise saying.\r\n\r\nJust here it seems proper to call attention to the fact that the\r\nConstitution prohibits any State from making any treaty with any foreign\r\ngovernment. The reason for this provision is very obvious, for, if\r\nallowed, a State might confer privileges upon foreign powers which\r\nwould be incompatible with the interests of other States. Therefore\r\nthe treaty-making power is kept wholly in the hands of the general\r\ngovernment, for in it every State has its representatives, and a voice in\r\nevery treaty which it makes.\r\n\r\n7. So numerous are the treaties which the United States has made with\r\nnearly every civilized nation upon earth, that it would require a very\r\nlarge volume to contain them. They are published with the laws, and\r\ngenerally in English and in the language of the nation with whom the\r\ntreaty is made. They may be found in the United States Statutes at Large.\r\nIt would require too much space in a work of this kind, to give even\r\ntheir titles.\r\n\r\n8. Wars have been stopped; boundary lines between nations have been\r\nestablished; commercial intercourse arranged; the purchase and sale of\r\nlands, and a variety of other things have been the subjects, and formed\r\nthe matter of treaties. Several of our most important ones relate to the\r\npurchase of territory. We acquired the States of Louisiana, Arkansas, and\r\nMissouri, by a treaty with France in 1803. It was called the Louisiana\r\npurchase; for it was nothing more than a purchase and sale of lands. We\r\nalso acquired Florida of Spain, in 1819, in the same way, and California\r\nand New Mexico of Mexico, in 1847.\r\n\r\n9. The immense quantities of land purchased of the Indians, were\r\nobtained by treaties with them. We are sorry to say that in some cases\r\nthey have treacherously violated their treaty obligations; but at the\r\nsame time it should be said by way of extenuating their offense, that\r\nour own government agents appointed for the purpose of taking care of\r\nthe interests of the poor Indians, have, in connection with the white\r\ntraders among them, shamefully cheated and wronged them, and provoked\r\nthem not only to disregard their obligations, but to perpetrate murders,\r\nrobberies, and thefts upon the whites who live near them. At different\r\ntimes during the years past, the Indians have been very hostile to us,\r\nand have waged war against the whites in their vicinity for the reasons\r\nabove stated. “Honesty is the best policy.”\r\n\r\n10. In the early part of the year 1867, a treaty was negotiated by\r\nWilliam H. Seward, our Secretary of State, on the part of the United\r\nStates, and Edward de Stoekl, the Russian Minister to the United States,\r\non the part of Russia, for the cession of the Russian possessions in\r\nNorth America to the United States.\r\n\r\nThis treaty may be regarded as one of the most important of all our\r\ntreaties with foreign powers; for by it the United States acquire between\r\n350,000 and 400,000 square miles of territory, in addition to our\r\nalready immense possessions; and it places by far the greater part of\r\nthe Northwestern coast of North America under the control of the United\r\nStates government.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of giving a specimen of a treaty, and showing some of the\r\ndetails of this negotiation, we here insert it in full, as agreed upon by\r\nthe contracting parties. $7,000,000 in gold is the consideration which\r\nthe United States paid Russia for this territory. This treaty has been\r\nratified by the United States and Russian governments, and the money,\r\n($7,000,000 in gold) has been appropriated for the purpose, and paid to\r\nthe Russian Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN TREATY.\r\n\r\nThe following is the text of the Russian-American treaty:\r\n\r\nThe United States of America, and his Majesty, the Emperor of all\r\nthe Russias, being desirous of strengthening, if possible, the good\r\nunderstanding which exists between them, have for that purpose appointed\r\nas their plenipotentiaries, the President of the United States, William\r\nH. Seward, Secretary of State, and his Majesty the Emperor of all the\r\nRussias, Mr. Edward de Stoekl, his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary to the United States, and the said plenipotentiaries,\r\nhaving exchanged their full powers, which were found to be in due form,\r\nhave agreed upon and signed the following articles:\r\n\r\nARTICLE I. His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, agrees to cede to\r\nthe United States, by this convention, immediately upon the exchange of\r\nthe ratifications thereof, all the territory and dominion now possessed\r\nby his said Majesty on the continent of America and in the adjacent\r\nislands, the same being contained within the geographical limits herein\r\nset forth, to wit: The eastern limit is the line of demarcation between\r\nthe Russian and British possessions in North America, as established by\r\nthe convention between Russia and Great Britain, of February 28 (16),\r\n1825, and described in articles third and fourth of said convention in\r\nthe following terms: Commencing from the southernmost point of the island\r\ncalled Prince of Wales’ Island—which point lies in the parallel of 50\r\ndeg. 40 min. north latitude, and between the 131st and 133d deg. of west\r\nlongitude, meridian of Greenwich—the said line shall ascend to the north\r\nalong the channel called Portland Channel, as far as the point of the\r\ncontinent where it strikes the 56th degree of north latitude. From this\r\nlast mentioned point the line of demarcation shall follow the summit\r\nof the mountains situated parallel to the coast as far as the point of\r\nintersection of the 141st degree of west longitude of the same meridian,\r\nand finally from the said point of intersection the said meridian line\r\nof the 141st degree in its prolongation as far as the Frozen Ocean. With\r\nreference to the line of demarcation laid down in the preceding article,\r\nit is understood—first, that the island called Prince of Wales’ Island\r\nshall belong wholly to Russia, and now, by this cession, wholly to the\r\nUnited States; second, that whenever the summit of the mountains which\r\nextend in a direction parallel to the coast from the 56th degree of north\r\nlatitude to the point of intersection of the 141st degree west longitude\r\nshall prove to be at the distance of more than ten marine leagues from\r\nthe ocean, the limit between the British possessions and the line of\r\ncoast which is to belong to Russia as above mentioned—that is to say, the\r\nlimit of the possessions ceded by this convention—shall be formed by a\r\nline parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed\r\nthe distance of ten marine leagues therefrom. The western limit, within\r\nwhich the territories and dominion conveyed are contained, passes through\r\na point in Behring’s Strait on the parallel of 65 deg. 30 min. north\r\nlatitude, at its intersection by the meridian which passes midway between\r\nthe island of Krusenstern, or Ignaalook, and the island of Ratmanog,\r\nor Noonerbook, and proceeds due north without limitation into the same\r\nFrozen Ocean. The same western limit beginning at the same initial point,\r\nproceeds thence in a course nearly northwest through Behring’s Strait and\r\nBehring’s Sea, so as to pass midway between the north-west part of the\r\nisland of St. Lawrence and the south-east point of Cape Choukottki to\r\nthe meridian of 172 deg. west longitude. Thence, from the intersection\r\nof that meridian, in a south-westerly direction, so as to pass midway\r\nbetween the island of Attou and the copper island of the Koranddorski\r\ncouplet or group in the North Pacific Ocean, to the meridian of 193 deg.\r\nwest longitude, so as to include in the territory conveyed the whole of\r\nthe Aleutian Islands east of that meridian.\r\n\r\nART. II. In the cession of territory and dominion made by the preceding\r\narticle, are included the right of property in all public lots and\r\nsquares, vacant lands, and all public buildings, barracks, and other\r\nedifices which are not private, individual property. It is, however,\r\nunderstood and agreed that the churches which have been built in the\r\nceded territory by the Russian government shall remain the property of\r\nsuch members of the Greek Oriental Church resident in the territory as\r\nmay choose to worship therein. Any government archives, papers, and\r\ndocuments relative to the territory and domain aforesaid, which may be\r\nnow existing there, will be left in possession of the agent of the United\r\nStates; but an authenticated copy of such of them as may be required will\r\nbe at all times given by the United States to the Russian government, or\r\nto such Russian officers or subjects as may apply for them.\r\n\r\nART. III. The inhabitants of the ceded territory, according to their\r\nchoice, reserving their natural allegiance, may return to Russia within\r\nthree years; but if they should prefer to remain in the ceded territory,\r\nthey, with the exception of uncivilized tribes, shall be admitted to\r\nthe enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens\r\nof the United States, and shall be maintained and protected in the free\r\nenjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion. The uncivilized\r\ntribes will be subject to such laws and regulations as the United States\r\nmay from time to time adopt in regard to aboriginal tribes of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nART. IV. His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, shall appoint, with\r\nconvenient dispatch, an agent or agents, for the purpose of formally\r\ndelivering to a similar agent or agents, appointed on behalf of the\r\nUnited States, the territory, dominion, property, dependencies, and\r\nappurtenances which are ceded as above, and for doing any other act which\r\nmay be necessary in regard thereto; but the cession, with the right of\r\nimmediate possession, is nevertheless to be deemed complete and absolute\r\non the exchange of ratifications, without waiting for such formal\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nART. V. Immediately after the exchange of the ratifications of this\r\nconvention, any fortifications or military posts which may be in the\r\nceded territory shall be delivered to the agent of the United States, and\r\nany Russian troops which may be in the territory shall be withdrawn as\r\nsoon as may be reasonably and conveniently practicable.\r\n\r\nART. VI. In consideration of the cession aforesaid, the United States\r\nagree to pay, at the Treasury in Washington, within —— months after the\r\nexchange of the ratifications of this convention, to the diplomatic\r\nrepresentative, or other agent of His Majesty, the Emperor of all the\r\nRussias, duly authorized to receive the same, —— million dollars in gold.\r\nThe cession of territory and dominion herein made is hereby demanded to\r\nbe free and unincumbered by any reservations, privileges, franchises,\r\ngrants, or possessions, by any associated companies, whether corporate\r\nor incorporate, Russian or any other, or by any parties except merely\r\nprivate individual property holders; and the cession hereby made conveys\r\nall the rights, franchises, and privileges now belonging to Russia in the\r\nsaid territory or dominion and appurtenances thereto.\r\n\r\nART. VII. When this convention shall have been duly ratified by the\r\nPresident of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, on the one part, and on the other by His Majesty, the Emperor\r\nof all the Russias, the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington\r\nwithin —— from the date hereof, or sooner, if possible. In faith whereof\r\nthe respective plenipotentiaries have signed this convention, and thereto\r\naffixed the seals of their arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRADITION TREATIES.\r\n\r\n1. Treaties have been made from time immemorial between rulers and\r\nnations for the purpose of promoting the interests of one or both parties\r\nin their commercial relations, or to secure allies in war; but the kind\r\nof treaties mentioned at the head of this section are of modern origin;\r\nand shows strongly the progress of nations toward a substantial unity of\r\ninterests and of discipline.\r\n\r\n2. The security of society demands that when men commit a crime in\r\none place they shall not be able to find a safe asylum to which they\r\nmay fly whenever the retributions of the law, which watches over the\r\nwelfare of the citizen, threaten to overtake them. The readiness with\r\nwhich criminals can pass from one country to another since steam has\r\nmade travel so speedy and pursuit for any long distance so difficult,\r\nincreases the evil. When criminals fly to another country they cannot be\r\npunished there, since their courts have no jurisdiction over a criminal\r\nfrom another nation, unless the act was committed in the country where\r\nthey were established; nor are governments usually willing to deliver an\r\nindividual on accusation only, unless there is an express stipulation,\r\nor treaty to this effect, between them. To overcome the difficulty a\r\ntreaty was made in 1842 between this country and England, in which it was\r\nmutually agreed that each country, on the demand of the government of the\r\nother, should give up criminals of certain kinds named in the treaty,\r\nwhen these after the crime had fled into their jurisdiction. It worked\r\nwell, since it multiplied the chances of punishment, and tended to check\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n3. Subsequently, treaties of the same kind were made between the United\r\nStates and the following countries:\r\n\r\n  France                               in  1843\r\n  Prussia, and 17 other German States   ”  1852\r\n  Switzerland                           ”  1855\r\n  Baden                                 ”  1857\r\n  Sweden                                ”  1860\r\n  Venezuela, South America              ”  1861\r\n\r\nThe time is probably not distant when treaties of this sort will be\r\nmade between us and all the civilized nations of the world; for the\r\nintercourse between us and foreign nations is greater than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these international arrangements is to render the\r\nperpetration of crime more dangerous than it would be if they did\r\nnot exist. Flight from the country where the crime was committed was\r\nformerly one of the most effectual methods of escaping the penalty. But\r\nextradition treaties, Atlantic cables, and land telegraphs, have nearly\r\nspoiled this game.\r\n\r\n3. An extradition treaty, then, is a mutual agreement between two\r\nnations to deliver up, each to the other, upon demand and proper proof\r\nof criminality, such persons as have committed crimes in one country and\r\nthen fled to the other, that they may be taken back, tried, and punished\r\nwhere the offense was committed. But these demands for escaped criminals\r\ncan not be sustained if made for every crime whatever. They will only be\r\ncomplied with when the crime is one which is named in the treaty itself.\r\nThese crimes, upon examination of a number of such treaties, we find to\r\nbe: 1. Murder, or an assault with an intent to commit murder. 2. Piracy.\r\n3. Arson. 4. Robbery. 5. Forgery, or the uttering of forged papers, or\r\nthe making or circulating counterfeit money, either paper or coin. 6.\r\nRape. 7. Embezzlement, and 8. Burglary.\r\n\r\n4. It should be observed that a mere demand for an alleged offender is\r\nnot sufficient. Proof enough to convince the judge before whom the case\r\nis brought must accompany the demand. He must be satisfied that the party\r\ndemanded has committed the alleged offense; when this is done the judge\r\nreports his finding to the Secretary of State, whose duty then is, under\r\nhis hand and seal of office, to issue the final writ of extradition;\r\nafter which the criminal may be taken out of the United States (by force,\r\nif necessary), and back to the country where he committed the crime,\r\nthere to be dealt with according to the laws which he violated.\r\n\r\n5. In some of our extradition treaties it is expressly stipulated that\r\nneither party (government) shall be bound to surrender its own citizens,\r\nor any person for merely a political offense. In others it is agreed that\r\nthe provisions in the treaty shall not apply to cases where the crime\r\nwas perpetrated before the treaty was made. This plea, we think, would\r\nbe held to be a good defense in all cases, whether so stipulated in the\r\ntreaty or not.\r\n\r\n6. The treaties between different nations for the surrender of criminals\r\nare so analogous to one of the provisions contained in our Constitution,\r\nthat to insert it here will give the reader a clear comprehension of its\r\nmeaning. It is found in the second section of article 4, and reads thus:\r\n\r\n“A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or other crime, who\r\nshall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall, on demand\r\nof the executive authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered\r\nup, to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crime.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. These officers, called Consuls, are employed by most civilized\r\nnations, all those at least who have an extensive intercourse with\r\nforeign countries, and they are recognized by the Law of Nations as being\r\nclothed, when acting in their official capacity, with the authority and\r\ninviolability of their respective governments. Their place of official\r\nbusiness is protected by the flag of their country, an insult to which\r\nrenders reparation or war necessary to maintain its honor. Consuls are\r\nagents of their governments, but most of their duties have reference to\r\nthe interests of private citizens who may be within their Consulate.\r\nThere may be a great number of them in one country, and they are usually\r\nlocated in the seaports.\r\n\r\n2. The Constitution provides that the President and Senate shall appoint\r\nall our Consuls. The President signs their commissions, which bear the\r\ngreat seal of the United States, and which prove to the government where\r\nthey are sent that they are duly appointed and authorized to discharge\r\nthe duties of Consuls at the ports or places to which they have been\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\n3. In order to show the nature of a Consul’s duties, such as the laws\r\nimpose upon him, we will state the substance of several acts relating to\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n1. Whenever a vessel belonging to a citizen of the United States arrives\r\nat the port where he is stationed, it is his duty to receive the ship’s\r\npapers, and to see if they are all correct.\r\n\r\n2. It is his duty to provide for sick, disabled, and destitute American\r\nseamen, and to send them home by some vessel going to the United States.\r\n\r\n3. He must hear the complaints of seamen, and settle disputes between the\r\ncaptain and men; and for good cause he may discharge the whole ship’s\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\n4. It is made his duty to receive and take care of the personal property\r\nof any citizen of the United States who has died within his Consulate,\r\nand to send any balance which may be left after paying his debts and\r\nnecessary expenses, to the treasury of the United States, to be held in\r\ntrust for the legal claimants. He must also give notice to the Secretary\r\nof State of the death of such person.\r\n\r\n4. For the purpose of carrying out and executing certain treaties made\r\nbetween the United States and China, Japan, Siam, and Turkey, Consuls to\r\nthose countries have been empowered with judicial functions. They were\r\nallowed to act as judges, and to try and punish citizens of the United\r\nStates who had committed crimes there. These, however, were extraordinary\r\npowers in special cases, and by no means common to the consular office.\r\n\r\n5. In the absence of a minister or diplomatic agent of the United States,\r\nthe President may authorize a Consul to perform the duties of such\r\nforeign minister; but these powers are rarely conferred on them. Their\r\nordinary duties relate to commercial affairs, and to such as are before\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n6. A Vice-Consul, or deputy Consul, is one appointed to act temporarily\r\nin case of sickness or absence of the Consul. His powers, while acting,\r\nare the same as those of the Consul in whose place he acts. Every Consul\r\nis required to give bonds for the faithful performance of his duties.\r\n\r\n7. Our commerce has been extended to almost every part of the globe, and\r\nfor this reason we need a great number of these officials. Their services\r\nare required at all great seaports, and at many smaller ones. The\r\ncompensation varies according to the amount of business to be transacted\r\nby them, from $7,500 down to $500. Some do not receive any salary, but\r\nare allowed the fees they are authorized to charge for their services.\r\n\r\n8. It is his duty to give his government and countrymen all such\r\ninformation as he possesses in relation to the laws and practices of\r\nthe country to which he is sent, which it would be important for them\r\nto know; and especially is it his duty to look after the interests and\r\nwelfare of his countrymen when they are within his Consulate, and to see\r\nthat no wrong or injustice is done to them by the people or government\r\nwhere he resides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPASSPORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. These are written documents, in due official form, signed and sealed\r\nby the proper authority, to convey official information, or serve as a\r\nmeans of protection, and to readily distinguish the American Citizen\r\nabroad, or to give a permission or authority to go where those not having\r\npassports are forbidden to go. The passport conveys authentic information\r\nto whom it may concern, to what nation the bearer of the passport\r\nbelongs; and second, to protect him, and secure to him all the rights and\r\nprivileges which the government has a right to claim for its citizens by\r\nvirtue of any treaty of amity and friendship existing between it and the\r\ncountry whither its citizens may go.\r\n\r\nThe passport informs the world that the bearer of it is a citizen of the\r\nUnited States, and that he travels under its protection, and that it\r\nwould demand and exact satisfaction of any one who wronged or injured him\r\nwho bears such credentials.\r\n\r\n2. In the United States, the Secretary of State is the officer authorized\r\nby law to issue passports. He has the authority also to cause them to be\r\nissued in foreign countries by our foreign ministers and consuls, under\r\nsuch restrictions and rules as may be designated by the President. This\r\nis allowed as a matter of convenience to our citizens who happen to be\r\nin foreign countries without them; who need their protection, and who\r\nwould be subjected to much delay and expense by going or sending home to\r\nprocure them.\r\n\r\nPassports are not granted to any other than citizens of the United\r\nStates, whether issued by the Secretary or by any diplomatic or consular\r\nagent of our government.\r\n\r\n3. Besides these passports, which are given only to our own citizens\r\nwhen in foreign countries, or who intend to go there, there is another\r\nkind issued to foreigners who wish to go among the Indians in the Indian\r\nterritory, or on the Indian reservations. Indeed, our own citizens are\r\nnot allowed to go among them without permission. But foreigners cannot go\r\nwithout a passport from the Secretary of War, which specifies the route\r\nover which the bearer must pass, and the length of time he is allowed\r\nto remain among them. This is done to prevent unfriendly foreigners\r\nfrom fomenting mischief, or from exciting unkind feelings towards our\r\ngovernment or people. Such unfriendly feelings have been created by\r\nforeigners, and we have often experienced the bitter fruits of it,\r\nespecially in times of war.\r\n\r\n4. Still another kind of passports is used in this country, and should\r\nbe noticed under this head. They are passports for American ships or\r\nvessels. When they are about to sail for a foreign port, the laws of the\r\nUnited States require each to procure one, under a penalty or fine of\r\ntwo hundred dollars upon the master if he departs from the United States\r\nfor a foreign country (other than some port in America), without it. The\r\npassport is prepared by the Secretary of State and is approved by the\r\nPresident. This is given to the master by the collector of the port from\r\nwhich the vessel sails, and is one of the ship’s papers, by which her\r\nnationality is known, and her protection shown to be that of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If the Executive Department that has charge of the public moneys\r\nis not highest in nominal rank, it certainly does not hold a less\r\nimportant and interesting place in the estimation of the country and of\r\nthe world than the Department of State. Every part of the government is\r\ndependent on this for its efficiency. It is the heart of the country.\r\nThe in-and-out-flowing of the tide of money from the central point marks\r\nthe pulses of the nation’s prosperity. Especially has this been the\r\ncase since the Civil War, and the immense developments and changes that\r\nfollowed it. The banking system, making the Treasury responsible for the\r\nissue of all the hundreds of millions of bank notes used in the business\r\nof the country, adds immensely to the importance of the United States\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\n2. The management of this Department is committed to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury. He is selected for that office by the President, and when\r\nhis nomination is approved by the Senate his appointment takes place. He\r\nholds office during a presidential term, unless sooner removed. He is a\r\nmember of the Cabinet and one of the President’s advisers.\r\n\r\n3. The financial policy adopted by the country depends very much on\r\nhis views on that difficult question, and the interests and wealth of\r\nmillions on the ability and integrity he possesses. He is therefore\r\nchosen on account of his real or supposed qualifications on questions of\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\nHe is aided in his duties by an Assistant Secretary, a Comptroller and\r\nSecond Comptroller, five Auditors, a Treasurer and his assistant, a\r\nRegister and his assistant, a Commissioner of Customs, a Comptroller\r\nof the Currency and his deputy, and a Solicitor of the Treasury. All\r\nthese have their offices in connection with the Treasury Department at\r\nWashington. In several of the large cities are sub-treasuries, each\r\npresided over by an assistant Treasurer, where public funds are received\r\nand disbursed. The Treasurers of the Mints are also, many of them,\r\nAssistant Treasurers of this Department. All these are appointed by the\r\nPresident and Senate in the same manner as the Chief Secretary.\r\n\r\n4. The sums of money actually handled, and the accounts of all moneys\r\nreceived and disbursed without passing into the vaults of the Treasury,\r\namount to many hundreds of millions annually, and require the constant\r\nservice of some hundreds of clerks. These all need to have clean hands\r\nand pure hearts, which is, unfortunately, more rare among men of all\r\nclasses than could be wished. Yet the whole is reduced to so accurate a\r\nsystem that a loss at any point immediately produces a disturbance in the\r\nwhole machinery, and a short examination suffices to reveal the point of\r\ndifficulty and the person responsible for it. Accordingly, losses and\r\ndefalcations are seldom experienced in or near the central point of the\r\nDepartment. If they occur, which is sometimes the case, it is usually\r\nsome officer at a distance who is found to be at fault, whose sphere\r\nof operations lies far from the centre and only occasionally passes\r\nunder scrutiny. Each has his separate sphere of duties which no one else\r\ninterferes with, and assumes his own responsibility; and probably no\r\nother institution in the world loses less in proportion to the amount of\r\nmoney involved and the number of persons handling it.\r\n\r\n5. Every account must be carefully examined and approved by the proper\r\nofficer before it can be presented for settlement and the money paid out,\r\nand whatever moneys may flow in, none can flow out but according to some\r\nlaw of Congress definitely appropriating it.\r\n\r\nAll officers having the handling of public funds are required to give\r\nsecurity for the faithful discharge of their duties. This must, by the\r\nrequirement of the law, be done before they can enter their respective\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARIES OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n  Alexander Hamilton, N.

Revenue, or the income of the government, is derived from various\r\nsources. A tax—or duty, as it is often called—laid on goods imported into\r\nthe country, is one of the most important. It is easy for a government to\r\nmanage without producing a very sensible effect on the people, and has\r\nbeen a favorite mode of raising a revenue with nearly all governments\r\nsince commerce became general.\r\n\r\n2. The sale of public lands has, in this country, been a source of large\r\nrevenue; though the desire to encourage emigration and develop the\r\nunsettled parts has led the government to sell them for a nominal sum.\r\nStill, these lands were so attractive and extensive as to sell rapidly\r\nand produce a considerable income. The Post Office Department has been\r\na source of income, in great part supporting itself. Duties paid on the\r\ntonnage of vessels, the forfeiture of goods smuggled, or introduced into\r\nthe country without paying the lawful tax or duty, and the forfeiture\r\nof vessels used in that unlawful trade, prizes taken in war, and fees\r\nrequired to be paid to various officials when their services are\r\nemployed, are minor sources of revenue.\r\n\r\n3. When all these are not sufficient, as in time of war, or when an\r\nimmense war debt is to be paid, direct taxes are laid on the property and\r\nbusiness of the country. This is called\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNAL REVENUE,\r\n\r\nand is borne with more or less patience, according as the people regard\r\nthe end to be gained important. The revenues of the States are mostly\r\nderived from this source. They are not allowed to raise their revenue\r\nfrom foreign commerce, since that would be a tax on goods liable to be\r\npaid by the people of another State.\r\n\r\n4. The necessity of laying large direct taxes does not, in this country,\r\noften arise in case of the General Government; but during and after the\r\ngigantic Civil War between the North and South, when enormous expenses\r\nhad to be met, and the credit of the government sustained, the direct\r\ntaxes became very large indeed. In 1861 Congress passed the “Internal\r\nRevenue Law,” by which twenty millions of dollars were to be annually\r\nraised from direct taxes on houses and lands in each of the States and\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nBy subsequent acts not only houses and lands were taxed, but almost every\r\nsort of property and business. Licenses were required for persons to\r\ncarry on their profession, trade, or business; incomes were taxed; deeds,\r\nmortgages, notes, bonds, bank checks, and papers of almost every kind\r\nwere invalid unless they had a revenue stamp upon them. Manufacturers had\r\nto pay a certain per-centage on whatever they made. Scarcely any calling,\r\ntrade, profession, or business escaped it, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n5. To carry out these provisions, the whole country was divided\r\ninto Revenue Districts, corresponding, so far as convenient, with\r\nCongressional Districts. An officer of the Treasury Department, called\r\nthe Commissioner of Internal Revenue, was appointed, charged with the\r\nduty of preparing instructions, forms, blanks, stamps, and licenses, to\r\nbe used in the collection by the multitude of minor officers employed,\r\nand of overseeing the whole work. Each district had its chief officer,\r\nand his deputies, assessors, and collectors, by whom the money at length\r\nreached the Treasury at Washington. It created an army of officers to\r\nbe paid. It was laid aside as soon as possible, and taxation made less\r\nonerous and expensive. The remarkable prosperity of the country at that\r\nparticular period made it easier to bear. Direct taxes laid by the\r\nGeneral Government are more economically collected by the State or local\r\nofficials, in all ordinary cases. This was a very extraordinary and\r\npressing one, and the people were so eager to put their debt in the way\r\nof extinction that it was endured with much patience for several years,\r\nwhen most of this cumbrous and costly machinery was laid aside.\r\n\r\n6. The vast war debt, the large number of government officers employed\r\nin attending to the interests of so large and prosperous a country, the\r\nsupport of the army and navy, the great number of foreign representatives\r\nand agents of the government, and the public works necessary for\r\nthe development or protection of the country, make a large revenue\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n7. It is best when the people are free and intelligent that they be\r\ngoverned as little as possible—or rather that they govern themselves as\r\nmuch as possible, and that as few officials as may be live on the fruits\r\nof other people’s labor. There must necessarily be an army of them, at\r\nthe least; but such arrangements should be made that public expenses may\r\nbe reduced, to the lowest point, and republican simplicity everywhere\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nThe principle and habit of public economy should be earnestly insisted\r\non, since the handling of immense sums of public money is much more\r\ndemoralizing than the acquisition of private wealth in legitimate ways.\r\nIt is a strong temptation to men of weak moral character; and private\r\nproperty is more likely to be carefully used and economically expended\r\nthan public funds. The smaller the revenue, consistent with the general\r\ndevelopment of the country, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDUTIES AND TARIFFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Duty is a term used to designate a sum paid by foreign merchandise\r\ncoming to our country for sale, for the privilege of entering and being\r\noffered to purchasers. Tariff is a rate, or scale, of duties.\r\n\r\n2. Ever since intercourse has become frequent between different nations\r\ncommerce has been occupied in effecting interchanges of the products and\r\nindustries of each country with others. Each country has peculiarities\r\nthat specially fit it for the production or manufacture of some article,\r\nor list of articles, which others would be unable to produce, or would\r\nproduce at greater inconvenience and expense, and which is of high value\r\nto all, or many of the others. The social principle has proved to be of\r\nextreme value to the improvement of men, and to their happiness; and we\r\nmight say that, in this unequal distribution of capacities in the lands,\r\nand the races who inhabit them, the exercise of the social principle, on\r\na broad scale, was made, by nature, indispensable.\r\n\r\n3. Each nation, then, devotes itself to its special features of\r\nproduction, and exchanges its surplus with others for what it wants of\r\ntheir different surplus, to mutual profit. Just as A is a farmer, and\r\nraises grain, while B is a mechanic. Each has a natural adaptation to\r\nthe business he pursues, and each needs what the other produces. So they\r\nexchange, and each has the full benefit of the success and different\r\ngenius and resources of the other. Commerce is the same in principle, and\r\ninterchange becomes constantly more extensive.\r\n\r\n4. Government naturally regulates commerce because it is one of the\r\ngeneral interests of the country. It finds an indefinite amount of\r\nforeign merchandise waiting to enter to be put on sale. It was long ago\r\ndiscovered that here was a convenient mode of producing a government\r\nincome without disturbing the people with a constant demand for money to\r\npay its expenses. Whatever foreign goods had to pay for permission to\r\nenter, was quietly added to the price afterward, and so the people paid\r\ntheir taxes to the government in an indirect way in the form of a Duty.\r\nThey pay the price asked, if it be within their means, without knowledge,\r\nor thought, of what part goes to the government, unless they study the\r\nsubject carefully.\r\n\r\nIt has always been the case, then, that a government could get all the\r\nmoney it wanted, from this source, in ordinary times, with very little\r\ntrouble. That mode is naturally a favorite with them. Whether it is the\r\nbest way for the people is another question, which has been, at different\r\ntimes, very warmly debated in our government. It is not our place here to\r\ntake up the argument, but it is worthy of a careful study by the people.\r\n\r\n5. A Tariff of duties is established to carry on the government. There\r\nis another object that has had many advocates, and has quite commonly\r\nexerted an influence to raise the tariff on some things. It is stated\r\nin the preamble, or introduction, to the first act passed by the first\r\nCongress, on this subject, July 4th, 1789, “Whereas, it is necessary for\r\nthe support of the government, for the discharge of the debts of the\r\nUnited States, _and the encouragement and protection of manufactures_,\r\nthat duties be laid on goods, wares, and merchandise imported.” It was\r\nconsidered important to protect and encourage our manufactures, by\r\nputting so high a price on the same kind of foreign goods that ours would\r\nhave the advantage and sell at a _less price_ or greater profit.\r\n\r\nThis might have been a wise measure, in the early days of the country,\r\nwhen there were few manufactures. Whether it has been so since, or is so\r\nnow, is not so clear.\r\n\r\n6. Every man should make up his mind what is right and best and act as\r\nhe sees to be most for the general good. It has two disadvantages. It\r\nembarrasses the interchange that we have described as so profitable, and\r\nunder a high tariff sometimes practically forbids it. It is unsocial,\r\nand we declare by it, that we will, so far as possible, live within\r\nourselves, and have as little to do with our neighbors as we can.\r\nBesides, it is our own people who have to pay the duty, mainly, if they\r\nuse the foreign goods; or the higher price on domestic goods if they buy\r\nthem; so that one class of the people, that is, the mass of them, pay\r\nanother small class large sums to manufacture what might be bought from\r\nforeigners with less money. It is a fine thing for the manufacturers, but\r\nnot quite so fine for those who buy them, unless they feel like making\r\ntheir countrymen a present for every piece of goods he will manufacture\r\nfor them, beside the proper cost as made by others.\r\n\r\nIt has the advantage of encouraging industries of different kinds; and\r\nhas been believed to contribute greatly to the general prosperity in\r\nthat way. Some think it best to let all those things arrange themselves,\r\nand leave each nation to bring us what they can produce cheapest and\r\nsell them more of what we can produce cheapest. They believe this is the\r\nsecret of prosperity, besides being more social. It is a question to be\r\ncarefully examined. It seems probable, that, in the end, all nations will\r\nagree on this policy, and raise their revenue in some other way. It is\r\nperhaps too soon to expect that, as yet.\r\n\r\nWe have never been without a tariff, though there has been much\r\ndiscussion in Congress, and between parties, whether it should be\r\nprotective or not. So it has often changed from low to high and back\r\nagain. The necessities of our war, and the heavy debt, made it important,\r\nin the highest degree, to raise all the revenue we could, and the subject\r\nhas not been much discussed for many years.\r\n\r\n7. The Duties are mostly collected in the cities, and, as foreign goods\r\ncome mainly by water, in the seaports of the country. Duties are often\r\ncalled Customs, and the places where they are collected Custom Houses;\r\nand the officers Custom House Officers. These places are located in\r\nports along our sea coast, and there are some thousands of custom house\r\nofficers of all grades. The buildings erected by the government have cost\r\nmany millions of dollars. The larger part of the duties are collected in\r\nthe great seaport cities, as Boston, New York, Baltimore, New Orleans,\r\nand San Francisco.\r\n\r\nPlaces, designated for foreign vessels to present their goods for\r\nexamination and collection of the duty, are called Ports of Entry. If\r\nthey are delivered at some other place, where there is no custom house\r\nthey are called Ports of Delivery.\r\n\r\n8. Congress alone has power to lay these duties. There are two modes\r\nof imposing them; sometimes one and sometimes the other being adopted,\r\naccording to the views of the Congress legislating. They are called\r\nspecific and ad valorem duties. Ad valorem means, according to the\r\ncost, and is counted on the cost in the country the article comes from.\r\nSpecific duties are so much on the article, without regard to the cost.\r\nOn many things imported there is no duty, and they are called “free\r\ngoods.”\r\n\r\nChanges are continually made in the tariff to conform to the requirements\r\nof the Treasury, the desires of the people, and the changing views of the\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWBACKS.\r\n\r\n9. When the duties on foreign goods have been paid, and they are\r\nafterwards exported, the duties which have been paid are refunded to the\r\nowner. The money thus paid back is called a drawback. All imported goods\r\nare entitled to drawback whenever they are taken out of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNTIES ON EXPORTED GOODS,\r\n\r\ntake money out of, instead of putting it in the treasury, yet the\r\ngovernment in a few cases has allowed bounties upon exported articles.\r\nFish taken by American vessels, refined sugar and distilled spirits\r\nmade from imported sugar and molasses, are examples. This was done to\r\nencourage domestic industry and enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS REVENUE FOR FIFTY-ONE YEARS.\r\n\r\nA Comparative Statement showing the Customs Revenue, Amount of Dutiable\r\nand

-----+--------------+------------+-----------+-----------+------+-------\r\n\r\n* The percentages in these columns are approximately, not absolutely\r\ncorrect, owing to the fact that the rates are computed upon the value of\r\nmerchandise, etc., imported, instead of the value of goods entering into\r\nconsumption in the respective years.\r\n\r\n† These amounts do not include imports into the Southern ports during the\r\nwar, from which no revenue was derived, namely, in 1861, $17,089,234; in\r\n1862, $90,789; and in 1864, $2,220.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONNAGE.\r\n\r\n11. Tonnage designates the capacity of a vessel for carrying goods,\r\nwhich depends on the tons of weight it can receive, and is computed by\r\nassigning so much space, in height, length, and breadth, to each ton. A\r\nrevenue, additional to that raised from the goods brought in vessels, is\r\nproduced by a tax on the tonnage, or carrying capacity of vessels.\r\n\r\nIt is laid, not only on foreign vessels, trading with our seaports, but\r\non our own vessels; a distinction being made so as to produce protection\r\nin favor of our own commerce and ship-builders. This also is paid by\r\nthose who buy the goods brought in these vessels; since whatever duty is\r\nlaid on the carrying trade must be made up by the higher price of the\r\narticle brought. It is a way of levying taxes without directly calling\r\nthe attention of the people to the fact.\r\n\r\n12. It is worthy of careful consideration whether the country would not\r\ngain as much, by removing all these embarrassments to commerce with other\r\ncountries, and different points on our coasts, as has been gained by free\r\ntrade between the different States. The Constitution forbids taxes to be\r\nlevied on inter-State commerce, or trade, and the country is undoubtedly\r\nthe gainer by such a provision.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 a tonnage duty of 50 cents per ton was laid on foreign vessels,\r\nand six cents on American vessels. During the Civil War the tonnage duty\r\nwas raised ten cents per ton on both foreign and American shipping.\r\n\r\nTonnage is collected only once a year by the collector of the port where\r\nthe vessel happens to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF DUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Tariff, or Scale of Duties, laid by the Laws of Congress, on\r\ngoods brought from foreign countries, requires to be paid when they are\r\nfirst introduced; or we might say, _before_ they are introduced. All\r\nthese goods are stopped as they approach the boundary line, or _on_ the\r\nboundary line, and carefully examined; and they can go no farther until\r\nthe duties imposed by Congress are received. When they have “passed the\r\nCustom House” they may be as freely sold as goods produced at home. No\r\ngovernment officer has any right to interfere with them. They have paid\r\nthe duty and have the freedom of the land. If they, by any chance or\r\neffort, get in by any other way, they are treated as stolen goods, and\r\nmay be seized and confiscated. However much they may have cost their\r\nowners, however highly they may prize them, however unquestioned was\r\ntheir ownership before they passed the limits of the country, if they are\r\nintroduced by any other than the Custom House Door, all right and title\r\nto them by the former owners ceases, and they become the property of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n2. So carefully is this point guarded that not only are government\r\nofficers provided for the sole purpose of watching against this illegal\r\nintroduction of goods, but a premium is offered to unofficial persons to\r\nsecure their aid. Any one who can point out (and prove the fact) goods\r\nof any kind, liable to duty, that have not passed the custom house, and\r\npaid that duty, is entitled to half the value of the goods; the other\r\nhalf belonging to the government. Smuggling, as bringing goods into the\r\ncountry without paying the duty is called, is held to be robbery of the\r\ngovernment, and ranks as a serious offense; and it really is so, as long\r\nas the government produces its income, or part of it, in this way. The\r\nlaw makes it part proprietor in the property until its claim is settled.\r\nBesides, to take from the government is to take from the people; since\r\nthey must make up, in some other way, for what is subtracted in this.\r\n\r\n3. To secure this payment of Duty, then, a large number of officers of\r\ndifferent grades are appointed, not only to examine the goods, determine\r\nthe amount required to be paid, receive the money and keep all the\r\naccounts connected with it, but to take care that all the goods, of\r\nwhatever kind, that are not permitted an entrance free of duty, shall\r\nduly pass examination, and be “entered,” as it is called, at the custom\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n4. The Head of these officers is the\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\nHe superintends the Customs Bureau in the Treasury Department. He\r\nis nominated, and, with the consent of the Senate, appointed by the\r\nPresident. All the accounts of officers employed in the collection of\r\nduties on imports pass through his bureau for examination and adjustment;\r\nhe prepares the forms of all papers used in this department of the\r\nrevenue; directs the form of keeping the accounts; brings suits when\r\nnecessary for the recovery of money due from officers of the department;\r\nand makes a report of any neglect of duty to Congress. A complete\r\nsummary, therefore, of the past and present condition of the customs\r\ndepartment may be found, at any time, in his office. With so perfect a\r\nsystem of supervision it does not matter how extensive the organization\r\nmay be. No confusion is possible. There are more than 30,000 persons\r\nemployed Under this officer; and they are scattered through the whole\r\ncountry where there are Ports of Entry or Delivery, as well as keeping\r\nguard along the whole coast line and frontier of the United States; yet\r\nthey are under as complete discipline and surveillance as the army or\r\nnavy. This bureau was organized in 1849; its business having previously\r\nbeen under the oversight of the First Comptroller of the Treasury. It has\r\ngeneral supervision of the conduct and accounts of all customs officials.\r\nThe highest in rank below this are\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLECTORS.\r\n\r\n5. Wherever there is a Port of Entry a Collector is appointed to\r\nsuperintend the collection of duties, receive the money, and transmit\r\nit to the United States Treasury. He is the principal officer of the\r\nCollection District connected with this Port, which often embraces\r\nseveral Ports of Delivery, and is required to see that all is properly\r\nconducted in his district. He receives his appointment directly from the\r\nPresident and Senate, and is removable at the pleasure of the President.\r\n\r\n6. As, in ordinary times, the most of the revenue required for the\r\nsupport of the government is derived from Customs, this is a responsible\r\noffice. Great care is required to secure the services of competent and\r\nfaithful men, and the bonds they are required to give are large. He\r\nnominates the subordinate officers connected with his custom-house, and\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury appoints them, if he sees no objection.\r\n\r\n7. The Collectors take care that all the goods, on which Congress has\r\nimposed a duty, pay the amount due. To this end he often requires one or\r\nmore deputies. The entire commerce of the part of the country falling\r\nin his district, with other countries, passes under his examination. He\r\nreceives all reports, manifests, and documents required to be exhibited\r\nby all vessels, domestic and foreign, on their entry into his port,\r\nand all accounts of all the goods they have on board. On these he must\r\nestimate the duties, receive the moneys, or bonds securing their payment,\r\nand grant all permits for landing the goods. He transmits, quarterly, all\r\nthe moneys collected in his department, with an accurate account of all\r\nthe transactions of his office during the quarter, to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury. These accounts pass to the Customs bureau, and the money to\r\nthe Treasurer of the United States.\r\n\r\n8. His duties, as described in the previous section, make him acquainted\r\nwith all the imports of the country, in his District or Port. He is also\r\nrequired to examine the manifests of all the vessels, and the accounts of\r\ntheir cargoes, that leave his port for a foreign country. This secures\r\na knowledge of all the exports of the country. It is his duty to give\r\nclearances, or permits, to all vessels leaving for foreign ports. It\r\nis unlawful for any vessel to depart without this document. A ship’s\r\nclearance can be properly given only when her manifest, or detailed\r\naccount of the quantity, kind, and value of her cargo is ascertained to\r\nbe correct.\r\n\r\n9. We give the form of a ship’s Manifest, and also of a Clearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHIP’S MANIFEST.\r\n\r\n“Report and manifest of the cargo laden on board of the ____, whereof\r\n____ is master, which cargo was taken on board at the port or ports of\r\n____, burthen ____ tons, built at ____, in the State of ____, and owned\r\nby ____, merchants at ____, and bound for ____.”\r\n\r\nThis, together with a particular description of the marks and numbers of\r\nevery bale, box, case, barrel, bundle or parcel on board of the vessel,\r\nis the manifest. It must be given to the collector of whatever port the\r\nvessel arrives at; and the master of her must swear that it is in all\r\nrespects a true and accurate account of all the cargo on board, to the\r\nbest of his knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\n10. The collector of the port can then compute the duties to be paid upon\r\neach article, and when these are paid, or secured to be paid, he gives\r\npermits to land the cargo, and deliver the goods to their respective\r\nowners. Then come in the duties of weighers, gaugers, measurers and\r\ninspectors of the customs, after permits are obtained to land the goods.\r\nIf they are such as require to be weighed, gauged, or measured, these\r\nofficers are sent to do it; and the inspector must allow nothing to leave\r\nthe ship until he has examined the marks and numbers, to see if they\r\ncorrespond with the permit and the manifest. If he suspects that there\r\nis an attempt to defraud the government by false names and marks, he is\r\nauthorized to open the package, box, case, cask, or whatever contains the\r\ngoods, and to examine them. In this way smuggling is prevented, and the\r\nrevenues arising from duties on imported goods secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHIP’S CLEARANCE.\r\n\r\nThis document is couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“_District of ____, Port of ____, ss._\r\n\r\n“These are to certify, to all whom it may concern, that A. B., master\r\nor commander of the ship (brig, barque, schooner) burthen ____ tons or\r\nthereabouts, mounted with ____ guns, navigated with ____ men, ____. ____\r\nbuilt, and bound for ____, having on board ____, hath here entered and\r\ncleared his said vessel according to law.\r\n\r\n“Given under our hands and seals, at the custom-house of ____, this ____\r\nday of ____, one thousand ____, and in the ____ year of the Independence\r\nof the United States of America.”\r\n\r\nThis is signed by the collector and by the naval officer of the port,\r\nwhen the commander is prepared to depart with his vessel to his\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n11. The compensation of collectors is not all given in the form of a\r\nsalary, but in part the fees for services rendered, and part of the\r\nforfeitures of smuggled goods. In the larger ports it is enormous, but\r\nin the smaller ones is often insignificant. It is a common mode of\r\ndoing business of this kind, and is supposed to stimulate the activity\r\nand secure the faithfulness of the officer in preventing frauds on the\r\ngovernment. The working of this plan is sometimes complained of as\r\ninspiring an over-officiousness embarrassing to trade and unnecessarily\r\nannoying to importers; and as producing too great an inequality in\r\nincomes. It is difficult to make a system quite perfect. Whether this\r\nadmits of improvement remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEYORS\r\n\r\n12. Are next in rank and authority to the Collectors. They are appointed\r\nin the same manner and receive their compensation in the same way. The\r\nSurveyor’s duty is to superintend the inspectors, weighers, measurers,\r\nand gaugers in his port; to visit all vessels arriving in it; make a\r\ndetailed report of them to the Collector; and examine all goods entered\r\nfor the benefit of drawback.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAVAL OFFICER\r\n\r\n13. Of a port, is another of the superintendents, appointed to oversee\r\nthe collection of the revenue. His appointment depends on the President\r\nand Senate, and his compensation on the amount of business done in his\r\nport, in the same manner as the Collector and Surveyor. His duties are,\r\nto some extent, parallel to those of the Collector; or he may be called\r\na local examiner and auditor of the Collector’s work and accounts, for\r\nthe sake of accuracy and correctness. He receives copies of all manifests\r\nand entries, and computes the duties on all goods, keeping a separate\r\nrecord of them. He must countersign permits, clearances, certificates,\r\ndebentures, and other documents issued by the Collector. He examines the\r\nCollector’s accounts, bonds, and expenditures, and certifies to them, if\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nA great number of deputies and employees are required to carry out the\r\ndetails of the collection of duties, since the entire amount of imports\r\ninto the country are required to be carefully examined.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVENUE CUTTERS\r\n\r\n14. Are employed to guard against smuggling. They are vessels of small\r\nsize, some steamers, and others sailing vessels, properly manned and\r\narmed, of high powers of speed; and are stationed as a coast guard near\r\nthe ports, and lines of ocean travel, to prevent the landing of imported\r\ngoods before they have paid the duty. Their officers are appointed by the\r\nPresident and Senate.\r\n\r\nThey look after all the ships going into any port, or any that may\r\napproach the coast; board them when within four leagues (or 12 miles)\r\nof the coast; examine the manifest of the cargo and every part of the\r\nvessel; put proper fastenings on the hatches, to prevent unlawful\r\ncommunication with the hold until the Custom’s officers have discharged\r\ntheir duty; and place a watch on board to remain until the vessel is\r\ndelivered into the charge of the proper revenue officer.\r\n\r\n15. They are revenue officers, and under the control of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, and the Collectors at the ports near which they are\r\nstationed. In case the President judges it best, they may be called on,\r\nat his direction, to coöperate with the Navy, and, in case they are\r\ndisabled in the discharge of their duty at such times, are entitled to be\r\ntreated in the same manner as officers and sailors in the Navy.\r\n\r\n16. These vessels carry a pennant and ensign with such marks on them as\r\nthe President may designate. If any vessel liable to seizure refuses\r\nto bring to at the direction of the commander of the Cutter, he is\r\nauthorized to fire into it after having shown his pennant and ensign,\r\nand compel it to submit to be boarded and examined. Much depends on the\r\nvigilance of these revenue cutters, as the sums paid on goods imported\r\namount to a great many millions of dollars, and want of due precaution\r\nwould cause the income of the government to be defrauded of large sums.\r\n\r\nThe commanders of revenue cutters report all matters relating to their\r\nduties weekly to the Collector of the port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT COINAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The United States mint, located at Philadelphia, is one of the most\r\nimportant establishments of the government. An act of Congress, passed in\r\n1792, was the first step towards its creation. Its design was, and its\r\nprincipal business has been, to coin the precious metals into money.\r\nIt has been for more than eighteen hundred years the usage of civilized\r\ngovernments to coin their own money. Ours, at a very early period of its\r\nexistence, began to do the same thing, and will probably continue to do\r\nit as long as it shall exist. Before the art of coining was known, the\r\nprecious metals were used as a standard of value, but they passed from\r\none to another by weight. The plan of cutting them into small pieces, and\r\nthen stamping their value upon them, by which their worth could be known\r\nas soon as seen, was an improvement upon the former mode. This process is\r\ndenominated coining. It has of late been brought so near perfection that\r\nour pieces of money are fine specimens of art.\r\n\r\n2. The officers, who manage and conduct the operations of this\r\nestablishment, are a Director, a Treasurer, an Assayer, a Melter and\r\nRefiner, a Chief Coiner, and an Engraver. They are all appointed by the\r\nPresident and Senate in the usual manner. The director appoints the\r\nassistants and clerks.\r\n\r\nAll must give bonds for the faithful performance of their respective\r\nduties upon which they enter under oath. The duties of these different\r\nofficers may almost be known by the names they bear. The director is the\r\nhead of the institution, and the others act under his general direction,\r\neach having his appropriate duties to perform. In the month of January\r\nof each year the director must make a report to the President of the\r\noperations of the mint and its branches for the preceding year.\r\n\r\n3. Any person may take gold or silver bullion or ores to the mint and\r\nreceive it back in coin, for a very trifling expense. Before it is\r\ncoined, after its value has been determined by the assayer, the director\r\nwill give a certificate for it, which is of the same value as the bullion\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\n4. We have stated that the principal business at the mint is the\r\nconversion of the precious metals into coin or money. But this is not\r\nits exclusive business. Another part is to melt and assay these metals,\r\nand to run them into ingots or bars either of pure or standard gold and\r\nsilver, according to the wish of its owner.\r\n\r\nUntil 1835 the mint at Philadelphia was the only establishment in the\r\nUnited States for coining money. But in that year a law was passed\r\nestablishing branch mints at New Orleans, in Louisiana; at Charlotte, in\r\nNorth Carolina; and at Dahlonega, in Georgia. In 1852, another branch\r\nwas established in California; in 1862, another at Denver, in Colorado\r\nTerritory; and in 1863, another at Carson City, in Nevada Territory,\r\nsince made a State; in 1864, another at San Francisco, in California,\r\nand another at Dallas City, in Oregon. Except the one in California, but\r\nlittle has ever been done at these branches. They are all similar to the\r\nprincipal one at Philadelphia; and the laws relating to that are made to\r\napply to these branches.\r\n\r\n6. The Constitution gives Congress the exclusive right to coin money, and\r\nprohibits all the States from doing it. This Congress does by the laws it\r\npasses in relation to the subject, and the various officers and workmen\r\nemployed to execute the work are only the agents of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe various coins which Congress has from time to time ordered to be made\r\nare of the following names and value:\r\n\r\n  _Gold._        _Value._\r\n  Eagle,          $10 00\r\n  Half-Eagle,       5 00\r\n  Quar. Eag.,       2 50\r\n  Doub. Eag.,      20 00\r\n  Three Dols.,      3 00\r\n  One Dollar,       1 00\r\n\r\n  _Silver._       _Value._\r\n  Dollar,          $1 00\r\n  Half-Dollar,        50\r\n  Quar. Dol.,         25\r\n  Dime,               10\r\n  Half Dime,           5\r\n  Three ct. piece,     3\r\n\r\n  _Copper._\r\n  One cent,\r\n  Two cents,\r\n  Three cents,\r\n  and formerly ½ c.\r\n  But these are now discontinued.\r\n\r\n7. Our coins are not made of pure gold and silver; a certain amount of\r\nother metals being added to produce a coin that will be less affected by\r\nthe friction of constant use. This alloy, or mixture, of the precious\r\nmetals is called Standard gold or silver, since a definite amount of\r\nthe alloy is required in all the coinage of the government for currency\r\npurposes. It does not alter the value of the coin; that being dependent\r\non the actual merchantable value of the sum of the metals used. By the\r\nlaw of 1837, standard gold and silver were declared to be nine hundred\r\nparts of pure metal, and one hundred parts alloy—equal to one-tenth\r\nalloy. Gold coins are alloyed with silver and copper, equal parts of\r\neach. Silver coins are alloyed with copper alone. Gold is declared to be\r\nworth fifteen times as much as silver by weight.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our own coins, Congress has, from time to time, passed\r\nlaws declaring the value of foreign coins, and making them a legal\r\ntender. But these laws were all repealed by the act of 1857, and it was\r\nmade the duty of the director of the mint to have them assayed, and to\r\ndetermine their weight, fineness, and value; for they are still used by\r\nbanks and merchants, and pass at the value determined by the mint.\r\n\r\nThe mint, up to 1861, had coined in gold, silver, and copper coin,\r\n800,662,475 pieces, worth $799,923,362.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES MINT.\r\n\r\nStatement of Domestic Gold and Silver deposited at the United States Mint\r\nand Branches, for Coinage, to June 30th, 1872.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n          FROM.        |     GOLD.      |    SILVER.    | GOLD AND SILVER.\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n  California           | $642,965,026.09|    $156,423.03| $643,121,449.12\r\n  Montana              |   30,648,265.24|     176,838.57|   30,825,103.81\r\n  Colorado             |   20,338,420.96|   1,114,543.43|   21,452,964.39\r\n  Idaho                |   17,141,523.84|     291,681.59|   17,433,205.43\r\n  Oregon               |   11,594,979.33|       1,863.74|   11,596,843.07\r\n  North Carolina       |    9,865,252.97|      44,110.95|    9,909,363.92\r\n  Nevada               |    1,010,280.17|   8,539,868.04|    9,550,148.21\r\n  Georgia              |    7,232,346.96|         403.83|    7,232,750.79\r\n  Virginia             |    1,629,188.79|           ----|    1,629,188.79\r\n  South Carolina       |    1,379,121.92|           ----|    1,379,121.92\r\n  Lake Superior        |            ----|   1,062,540.81|    1,062,540.81\r\n  Arizona              |      975,401.39|      39,873.08|    1,015,274.47\r\n  New Mexico           |      823,021.29|           ----|      823,021.29\r\n  Utah                 |      146,147.18|     261,204.71|      407,351.89\r\n  Nebraska             |       24,381.57|     200,976.53|      225,358.10\r\n  Alabama              |      213,750.66|           ----|      213,750.66\r\n  Wyoming Territory    |      138,878.12|          86.48|      138,964.60\r\n  Tennessee            |       81,529.69|           ----|       81,529.69\r\n  Washington Territory |       67,745.38|           ----|       67,745.38\r\n  New Mexico and Sonora|            ----|      51,653.31|       51,653.31\r\n  Dakota               |        5,760.00|           ----|        5,760.00\r\n  Vermont              |        5,611.97|           ----|        5,611.97\r\n  Kansas               |        1,009.62|         468.00|        1,477.62\r\n  Sitka                |          397.64|           ----|          397.64\r\n  Maryland             |          108.00|           ----|          108.00\r\n  Other Sources        |   85,226,912.42|       2,751.15|   85,229,663.57\r\n  Parted from Silver   |    4,690,402.30|           ----|    4,690,402.30\r\n  Fine Bars            |            ----|   5,298,490.02|    5,298,490.02\r\n  Parted from Gold     |            ----|   5,821,721.97|    5,821,721.97\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n     Total             | $836,205,463.50| $23,065,492.24| $859,270,962.47\r\n  ---------------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n\r\nASSAY OFFICE.\r\n\r\n1. In 1853 the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to establish an\r\noffice in the city of New York for the receipt, melting, refining and\r\nassaying of gold and silver bullion and foreign coins, and for casting\r\nthe same into bars, ingots, or disks. The assistant treasurer of the\r\nUnited States in New York, is treasurer of this assay office, and the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury appoints such other clerks, assistants, and\r\nworkmen as shall be necessary for the management of its business.\r\n\r\n2. Persons having gold or silver bullion, ores or foreign coin, may\r\ndeposit them in his office, and it will be refined and assayed (at\r\nno more cost than the actual expense of doing the work), its value\r\nascertained, and the owner will be paid for it in coins of the same value\r\nand metal as that deposited. It is not coined in this office, but cast\r\ninto bars, ingots or disks—either of pure metal or of standard fineness,\r\nas the owner may prefer—the true weight and value of which are stamped\r\nthereon; and the owner may either take them in payment for his bullion or\r\nforeign coin, or it will be coined for him at the United States Mint, if\r\nhe wishes. The bars spoken of are often kept in that form, and are used\r\nas coin among banks, brokers, and merchants, who receive and pay large\r\namounts of the precious metals. With them it passes as coin, for its\r\nexact weight and value are stamped upon it.\r\n\r\n3. This establishment was located at New York more for the convenience\r\nof those who do business there, than for the necessity of such an\r\ninstitution; for at the mint at Philadelphia there is a department\r\nfor doing the same work as is done here. But at New York there is a\r\nlarger amount of foreign coin than in any other place, and it is often\r\nadvantageous to its owners to have it converted into American coin, that\r\nit may be used with greater facility. Although many foreign coins do\r\ncirculate in this country, but few know their value. Consequently they\r\ndo not pass so readily; and for this reason they are melted and run into\r\nbars of known value, or re-coined into American money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BANKING.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The present banking system was established by an act of Congress in\r\n1863. The plan is quite different from any before in use, and commends\r\nitself to the whole country by the stability it gives to the currency in\r\nuse in the transaction of its business, and the security it furnishes\r\nagainst loss of values common under the old systems. They are managed by\r\nprivate parties and corporations, apart from the government, but under a\r\ncertain degree of supervision, and by its authority. By the act referred\r\nto any number of persons not less than five may associate themselves\r\ntogether for the purpose of banking, by compliance with the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n2. First: They must, under their hands and seals, make a certificate\r\nwhich shall specify—\r\n\r\n1. The name assumed by such association.\r\n\r\n2. The place where its business is to be conducted.\r\n\r\n3. The amount of its capital stock (which cannot be less than $50,000),\r\nand the number of its shares.\r\n\r\n4. The names of its shareholders, and the number of shares held by each.\r\n\r\n5. The time when such association shall commence business.\r\n\r\n6. A declaration that said certificate is made to enable such persons to\r\navail themselves of the advantages of this act.\r\n\r\n3. This certificate must be properly acknowledged before some competent\r\nperson, and must be sent to the comptroller of the currency in the\r\nTreasury Department, to be recorded and kept by him. When this, and all\r\nother acts which the law requires, has been done by the association, the\r\ncomptroller of the currency gives them a certificate under his hand and\r\nofficial seal, to that effect, and that they are authorized to commence\r\nbusiness. This constitutes the association a corporation. They have the\r\nright to make and use a common seal, and have all the rights, and are\r\nliable to all the responsibilities of ordinary legalized corporations;\r\nand may exist not to exceed twenty years from the passage of this\r\nact. Every shareholder is made personally liable for the debts of the\r\nassociation or bank, to the amount of the par value of his stock.\r\n\r\n4. In order to secure the holders of bills issued by these banks, they\r\nmust deposit with the Treasurer of the United States, United States\r\nbonds bearing interest to an amount not less than one-third of the\r\ncapital stock paid in. These bonds are safely kept by the Treasurer. The\r\ncomptroller of the currency then issues to the bank an amount of bank\r\nnotes equal to the amount of bonds thus deposited, less ten per cent.\r\nIn case the bank should fail to redeem its circulating bills, its bonds\r\nare sold, and with the proceeds the comptroller of the currency redeems\r\nthem, or orders them to be paid at the United States Treasury. The bonds\r\nheld by the Treasurer as security for the redemption of the bills issued\r\nby the association, must be transferred to him in trust; thus giving him\r\nentire control of them in case it becomes necessary to sell them in order\r\nto redeem the bills of any association which may have failed to pay them\r\non demand.\r\n\r\n5. This act has brought a great number of banks into existence, besides\r\norganizing most of the banks formerly existing under State laws under\r\nthis system; so that we have a nearly uniform system of banking all over\r\nthe United States. The bills of these banks pass in any part of the\r\ncountry, which was not often the case formerly. In case the bank should\r\nbe mismanaged, or fail to pay for any cause, there is ample security for\r\ntheir redemption deposited in the United States treasury, where they will\r\nbe paid on presentation.\r\n\r\n6. The bill-holder is also better protected against counterfeits than he\r\nwas under the old system; for all the bills issued by these associations\r\nare engraved by the government, and the plates and dies on which they\r\nare printed are kept by the comptroller of the currency in the Treasury\r\nDepartment. The engraving is done in the best possible manner, and it is\r\nexceedingly difficult to counterfeit them. Besides this, they all have\r\nthe imprint of the seal of the Treasury on their face, and are numbered\r\nand countersigned by the treasurer and register. With all these guards\r\nand precautions, we have the best paper currency ever used since the\r\nestablishment of the government.\r\n\r\n7. This act necessarily threw upon the Treasury Department a great\r\nincrease of labor, and in order to provide for it a separate bureau was\r\ncreated, which is denominated the bureau of currency, the chief officer\r\nof which is called the comptroller of currency. He acts under the general\r\ndirection of the Secretary of the Treasury. This bureau is charged with\r\nthe execution of this and all other laws that may be passed by Congress\r\nrespecting the national currency. The comptroller of the currency is\r\nappointed by the President and Senate, has a deputy, receives a salary\r\nof $5,000 per year, holds his office five years, has an official seal,\r\ngives bonds to the amount of $100,000, and takes and subscribes the oath\r\nof office prescribed by the Constitution and the laws. His duties are\r\nnumerous and very responsible, he having hundreds of millions under his\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe term national banks, given to these institutions, and national\r\ncurrency to the bills they issue, were given from the fact that they\r\nwere organized by an act of Congress, and that the security for the\r\nredemption of their bills consists exclusively of national bonds; no\r\nother securities will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The United States government belongs to its people. Those people own\r\nproperty estimated at upwards of thirty billions of dollars. The public\r\nlands belonging to the government are between one and one and a half\r\nbillions of acres. Besides, the public domains contain gold, silver,\r\niron, coal, and a large number of other mineral deposits, chiefly in\r\nregions worthless for agricultural purposes, of unknown, but ascertained\r\nto be, at least, a very great quantity—enough to make all its present\r\ninhabitants millionaires if (besides paying the debt) their value could\r\nbe divided among them. The capacity of the country for production is very\r\nfar beyond what is drawn from it now. The future will probably increase\r\nit a thousand fold, for we are yet a new people, and in the act of\r\nsettling ourselves to the work of development.\r\n\r\nWe are very rich, if all our resources are taken into account, yet we are\r\nin debt. In five years from the commencement of the civil war the public\r\ndebt had run up from less than one hundred million dollars to over two\r\nbillion seven hundred millions. This we began to reduce at once, for as\r\na nation we do not like to be in debt; and it was, December 1st, 1873,\r\na little over two billion one hundred and fifty millions. The debt is,\r\nindeed, a trifle compared with our vast national property; but we do\r\nnot wish to sell our property at a loss, nor disturb the regular course\r\nof business; so it stands to be gradually paid in the regular course of\r\nthings, as we find it to be convenient.\r\n\r\nIt is a vast sum, but gives more trouble by reason of the desire and\r\ndetermination of the people to pay it soon, and sacrifice no property,\r\nthan from any inability to meet it.\r\n\r\nWe add a table of the Public Debt for every year since 1791, a Statement\r\nof the debt in detail Dec. 1st, 1873, and various Statistics relating to\r\nthe finances, resources, and business of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES, IN EACH YEAR, FROM 1791 TO 1874.\r\n\r\n  1791           75,463,476.52\r\n  1792           77,227,924.66\r\n  1793           80,352,634.04\r\n  1794           78,427,404.77\r\n  1795           80,747,587.38\r\n  1796           83,762,172.07\r\n  1797           82,064,479.33\r\n  1798           79,228,529.12\r\n  1799           78,408,669.77\r\n  1800           82,976,294.35\r\n  1801           83,038,050.80\r\n  1802           80,712,632.25\r\n  1803           77,054,686.30\r\n  1804           86,427,120.88\r\n  1805           82,312,150.50\r\n  1806           75,723,270.66\r\n  1807           69,218,398.64\r\n  1808           65,196,317.97\r\n  1809           57,023,192.09\r\n  1810           53,173,217.52\r\n  1811           48,005,587.76\r\n  1812           45,209,737.90\r\n  1813           55,962,827.57\r\n  1814           81,487,846.24\r\n  1815           99,833,660.15\r\n  1816          127,334,933.74\r\n  1817          123,491,965.16\r\n  1818          103,466,633.83\r\n  1819           95,529,648.28\r\n  1820           91,015,566.15\r\n  1821           89,987,427.66\r\n  1822           93,546,676.98\r\n  1823           90,875,877.28\r\n  1824           90,269,777.77\r\n  1825           83,788,432.71\r\n  1826           81,054,059.99\r\n  1827           73,987,357.20\r\n  1828           67,475,043.87\r\n  1829           58,421,413.67\r\n  1830           48,565,406.50\r\n  1831           39,123,191.68\r\n  1832           24,322,235.18\r\n  1833            7,001,032.88\r\n  1834            4,760,081.08\r\n  1835              351,289.05\r\n  1836              291,089.05\r\n  1837            1,878,223.55\r\n  1838            4,857,660.46\r\n  1839           11,983,737.53\r\n  1840            5,125,077.63\r\n  1841            6,737,398.00\r\n  1842           15,028,486.37\r\n  1843           27,203,450.69\r\n  1844           24,748,188.23\r\n  1845           17,093,794.80\r\n  1846           16,750,926.33\r\n  1847           38,956,623.38\r\n  1848           48,526,379.37\r\n  1849           64,704,693.71\r\n  1850           64,228,238.37\r\n  1851           62,560,395.26\r\n  1852           65,131,692.13\r\n  1853           67,340,628.78\r\n  1854           47,242,206.05\r\n  1855           39,969,731.05\r\n  1856           30,963,909.64\r\n  1857           29,060,386.90\r\n  1858           44,910,777.66\r\n  1859           58,754,699.33\r\n  1860           64,769,703.08\r\n  1861           90,867,828.68\r\n  1862          514,211,371.92\r\n  1863        1,098,793,181.37\r\n  1864        1,740,690,489.49\r\n  1865        2,682,593,026.53\r\n  1866        2,783,425,879.21\r\n  1867        2,692,199,215.12\r\n  1868        2,643,753,566.38\r\n  1869        2,652,533,662.28\r\n  1870        2,509,270,608.00\r\n  1871        2,303,573,543.00\r\n  1872        2,197,743,440.72\r\n  1873        2,153,489,155.96\r\n  Apr. 1874   2,152,690,728.62\r\n  Oct. 1875   2,122,466,227.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES BONDS.\r\n\r\nSIXES OF 1861.—Dated 1861, and redeemable in twenty years from January\r\n1st and July 1st of that year.

unfortunately, have never been able to so arrange their mutual\r\nrelations as to dispense with violent and deadly contests. Although they\r\nare less frequent and shorter now than formerly, they are more costly\r\nand more destructive, and every nation is still, as formerly, obliged to\r\nanticipate the possibility of war and to make provision for its sudden\r\noccurrence, that it may not be borne down and overwhelmed by the first\r\nshock. It is an event so probable, even, and especially if the country\r\nshould be in a defenseless state, that it has become a maxim of prudence\r\nwith statesmen to avoid war by being prepared for it. The nation that can\r\nbest repel an attack is least likely to be attacked.\r\n\r\nMost governments, like our own, had their birth and early history in the\r\nconfusion and devastation of that great destroyer of life and property;\r\nand it is natural that the first leisure of peace should be occupied in\r\npreparing themselves, in the most effective manner possible, for both\r\ndefensive and offensive operations in case of its return.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution contemplates the existence of an army and navy for\r\nwarlike purposes, and makes the President Commander-in-chief of both. The\r\nfirst Congress assembled under the Constitution hastened, in its first\r\nsession, to provide him an army and navy to command by organizing the\r\nDepartment of War. At its head was placed the Secretary of War, and so\r\nnecessary was it deemed to the dignity and security of the nation that he\r\nwas made one of the principal officers of the government, having a seat\r\nin the cabinet and being regarded as one of the advisers of the Chief\r\nMagistrate. He is appointed by the President with the consent of the\r\nSenate. A Chief Clerk, to be appointed by the Secretary, was provided\r\nfor by the act of 1789 creating the Department, who was the second\r\nauthority in it, and acted as Secretary, in case of a vacancy; but when\r\nthe Civil War raised this Department to great prominence, in 1861, a law\r\nwas passed authorizing the appointment of an Assistant Secretary, and, in\r\n1863, two additional Assistant Secretaries were provided for by law; all\r\nto be appointed by the President. This last measure was temporary only,\r\ndesigned to expire when returning peace should reduce the Department to\r\nits ordinary condition.\r\n\r\nAt first the affairs of the national navy were managed by the Secretary\r\nof War. This was changed, as we shall see, when our commerce and foreign\r\nrelations became more important.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War ranks next to the President in military authority\r\nand dignity, and has the whole oversight, under him, of the army and its\r\naffairs. He makes out military commissions to be signed by the President,\r\nhas the care of providing for the support, clothing, pay, and equipment\r\nof the army, and of all military stores required to keep the army in\r\nefficient drill, and in readiness against a possible war. He has the care\r\nof all books, records, and papers relating to the army and to military\r\naffairs. The names, grades, time of enlistment, term of service, and time\r\nof mustering out of all officers and privates in the army, whether in the\r\nregular or volunteer service, are to be found in his office. All military\r\naccounts are kept and adjusted under his supervision. These cares and\r\nduties have become so numerous and important as to require a careful\r\norganization of the Department into sub-departments, or bureaus, as the\r\nCommissary’s, the Quartermaster’s, and the Ordnance bureaus. The general\r\nmanagement of the whole depending on the Secretary of War, he evidently\r\nrequires to be a man of judgment, thoroughly versed in military affairs,\r\nand of eminent organizing ability.\r\n\r\nA Solicitor, to have charge of the legal business of this Department, was\r\nprovided for by law in 1863, to be appointed by the President and the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARIES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n  Henry Knox, Mass., Sept. 12, 1789.\r\n  Timothy Pickering, Pa., Jan. 2, 1795.\r\n  James McHenry, Md., Jan. 27, 1796.\r\n  James Marshall, Va., May 7, 1800.\r\n  Samuel Dexter, Mass., May 13, 1800.\r\n  Roger Griswold, Ct., Feb. 3, 1801.\r\n  Henry Dearborn, Mass., March 5, 1801.\r\n  William Eustis, Mass., March 7, 1809.\r\n  John Armstrong, N.

The military successes of the United States would seem to prove\r\nundeniably, that, if the nation had adopted a career of conquest as did\r\nAncient Rome, it might have played an important part in the history of\r\nwarlike peoples. The undisciplined militia shut up a strong army in\r\nBoston in 1774, and, had not their powder failed, would very likely have\r\nforced the British to evacuate that place immediately after the battle of\r\nBunker Hill.\r\n\r\n2. Washington’s army, made up in large part of militia, seemed always on\r\nthe point of dissolution, and yet the British, after spending more than a\r\nhundred millions in fitting out armies against them, and possessing the\r\nimportant superiority of free movement on the sea, for the transportation\r\nof forces easily and rapidly to any desired point, never could gain a\r\npermanent foothold, though opposed only by a ragged, famished, and half\r\ndisorganized army.\r\n\r\n3. The war of 1812—the Mexican War—and the Civil War, all bear testimony\r\nto the excellence of the material for military operations to be found\r\namong us. Yet we are a peace loving people. The government has never had\r\nmore than the skeleton of an army in times of peace. While the Great\r\nPowers of Europe keep up armies of half a million of men, our army,\r\nvery soon after the late gigantic war, was reduced to less than 30,000\r\nmen; barely enough to keep the Indians in order, garrison the frontiers\r\nslightly, and furnish a nucleus of soldiers and trained officers in case\r\nof a war. By a law of Congress, it was enacted that every sound and\r\nhealthy man, with a few exceptions in special cases, between the ages of\r\n18 and 45, should be enrolled and equipped for military duty. Then, by\r\nthe laws of the States, they are required on certain days in each year\r\nto meet in companies, regiments or brigades, for drill and practice in\r\nmilitary exercises.\r\n\r\n4. By these means military organizations are kept up in every part of the\r\ncountry, together with some knowledge of the military art. These, in time\r\nof war or domestic insurrection, may be called out with but a few days’\r\nnotice; and a large army of citizen soldiers can be raised in a very\r\nshort time. With such facilities for raising men, it is unnecessary to\r\nkeep a standing army of much magnitude. A few thousand men to guard our\r\nfortifications and military posts are sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe late civil war between the South and the North gave ample evidence of\r\nthis; for when it became necessary to raise a million of men, it was done\r\nin a short time, and after a little practice they became good soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ACADEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The success of military affairs in time of war depends, in great\r\nmeasure, on a thorough knowledge of the science of war, and especially\r\nof engineering, so often requiring to be applied with haste and accuracy\r\nto the _con_struction or _de_struction of military defenses. It requires\r\na complete knowledge of certain branches of mathematics, and an\r\nunderstanding of their application to warlike purposes. Various other\r\nspecial studies are required to prepare men for prompt and able action\r\nin military operations. For the purpose of keeping a corps of officers,\r\nwell fitted to meet these requirements, ready for possible occasions\r\n\r\n\r\nA MILITARY ACADEMY\r\n\r\nwas established. It is located on the west bank of the Hudson river, at\r\nWest Point, in the State of New York, and about 50 miles from the city of\r\nNew York, and is one of the government institutions. It had its origin in\r\nan act of Congress passed as early as 1802. Under this act this far-famed\r\nmilitary school was commenced, but on a scale, in every respect, very\r\nmuch inferior to what it has since become.\r\n\r\n2. Its name explains its character and objects. It was established and\r\nhas been continued at a great expense, for the purpose of teaching\r\nand training up young men in the science and art of war, that in any\r\nemergency the country might have a sufficient number of men, educated\r\nand skilled in all such arts and sciences as appertain to war. Hence,\r\nmathematics, engineering, gunnery, drawing, natural and experimental\r\nphilosophy and military tactics, are among the principal branches taught.\r\nIn all of these, able professors give instruction to the cadets, as the\r\npupils are called. Chemistry, geology, and the French language are also\r\ntaught at this institution. The instruction is thorough, the discipline\r\nexcellent, and some of the graduates of this celebrated school rank high\r\namong the scientific men of the country.\r\n\r\n3. Congress controls and regulates this establishment, as it does all\r\nother departments, institutions, and works belonging to the government.\r\nIt enacts all laws relating to its officers, professors, and cadets, and\r\nto the management of the institution.\r\n\r\n4. By a law passed in 1843, the number of cadets to be admitted was made\r\nto correspond with the number of Senators and Representatives from each\r\nState. Every State and Territory is entitled to send as many cadets\r\nas it has Senators and Representatives in Congress. This gives each\r\nTerritory, however, but one; as a Territory has no Senators, and but one\r\nRepresentative. By the same law the District of Columbia is allowed one.\r\nTo give every part of the country an equal chance, it was enacted that\r\neach Congressional district in each State and Territory should be allowed\r\nto send one cadet, to be educated at West Point. These are generally\r\nnominated for appointment by the Congressmen from their respective\r\ndistricts, and the President appoints. The cadet must be an actual\r\nresident of the district for which he is appointed.\r\n\r\n5. In addition to these, it is provided by the same act, that ten\r\nmore cadets may be appointed at large; _i. e._, without regard to\r\nCongressional districts. In order to be admitted as a cadet, the\r\ncandidate must be well versed in reading, writing, and arithmetic;\r\nmust not be under 14 nor over 21 years of age; and must sign articles,\r\nagreeing to serve the United States eight years. After he has finished\r\nhis studies and has graduated, he is considered as a candidate for a\r\ncommission in the army, according to the duties he may be competent to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\n6. The Military Academy may be considered a branch of the War Department.\r\nMen who have been educated there have rendered the country signal service\r\nin times of war, have made able commanders, and have proved themselves\r\nthoroughly skilled in military science. Not only in the military service\r\nhas it been a benefit to the country, but in the civil walks of life.\r\nMany of its graduates have distinguished themselves as engineers,\r\nastronomers, and in other scientific professions and useful employments.\r\n\r\n7. There is an annual examination of the cadets, and of the general\r\naffairs of the institution, by a committee appointed by the President,\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of Congressmen and military officers. It is the duty of\r\nthese examiners to attend the examination, inspect its discipline, and\r\ncourse of instruction, look after its fiscal affairs, and all other\r\nmatters relating to the Academy, and report the same to the Secretary of\r\nWar, for the use of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nDEPOTS OF WAR MATERIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the government can be sure of the support of the\r\ncitizens in time of war and that they furnish the best kind of material\r\nof that description for military purposes. An army of great effectiveness\r\ncan be organized in a comparatively short time, when important interests\r\nof the country are at stake. Not so, however, with the arms they require\r\nto use for offensive purposes. These require time and skilled workmen to\r\nconstruct them. They are therefore kept in readiness for use in Depots\r\nconstructed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1794, Congress enacted that three or four arsenals and\r\nmagazines, with an armory attached to each, should be established for the\r\nsafe keeping of military stores. An arsenal is a place where arms and\r\nmilitary stores are kept. An armory is a place where arms are made or\r\nrepaired. The armories where arms are manufactured are at Springfield,\r\nin Massachusetts, and at Harpers’ Ferry, in Virginia. But there are many\r\nothers where they are repaired.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, the President was authorized to purchase sites and to erect\r\nas many more arsenals and manufactories of arms as he might deem\r\nexpedient. Each of these establishments was formerly under the direction\r\nof a superintendent; but they are now placed under the direction of\r\nthe Ordnance Department. The office of superintendent of the armories\r\nat Springfield and Harpers’ Ferry, was also abolished in 1842; and\r\nits duties have since been performed by such officers of the ordnance\r\ncorps as were designated by the President. In each armory there is\r\nemployed a master armorer, who superintends the workmen. In addition\r\nto those already named there are arsenals and armories at Pittsburgh\r\nand Bridesburg, in Pennsylvania; at Washington City; at Watervliet, in\r\nNew York; Watertown, Mass.; at Columbus, Ohio; at Indianapolis, in\r\nIndiana; and at Rock Island, in Illinois. They are parts of the military\r\nestablishment of the country, and belong to the War Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. An army is designed, in idea, to supply a powerful instrument of\r\noffense and defense, that shall so thoroughly organize and fuse together\r\na large number of individuals that the whole shall act as one, and\r\nbe perfectly under the control of the directing mind. An army fully\r\nrealizing this idea, would suppress, in its military acts, all thoughts\r\nand sentiments of its individuals, and be used by its commanding general\r\nas he would use his own hand, arm and foot. It should move at his will,\r\nstrike where, as long and as heavily as he saw best, and be to him a\r\nperfect machine as to obedience.\r\n\r\n2. This idea is seldom more than partially realized; but it is the aim\r\nof all military drill, discipline, and law. The Articles of War are the\r\nbody of laws enacted by Congress defining the relations of soldiers to\r\ntheir officers, so as to secure as fully as possible among a free people\r\nthis thorough subordination, defining the conduct of the soldier toward\r\nhis superior, prescribing the duty of the officer, and securing as far as\r\npossible in connection with such subordination the rights of the soldier.\r\n\r\n3. They contain general directions concerning the organization,\r\nenlistment, and discharge of men, rules for leaves of absence, punishment\r\nfor absence without leave, or for desertion, and other penalties for\r\nconduct improper or criminal in a soldier. Many of these rules are\r\nvery strict and the penalties severe, since a neglect to obey might\r\nendanger the safety of an army or the country, or interfere with the most\r\nimportant operations. War is a very exacting pursuit.\r\n\r\n4. It is relaxing also in some directions and rules are made requiring,\r\nand often without effect, obedience to some of the most common principles\r\nand practices of morality. It often becomes quite impossible to enforce\r\nthese amid the fierce excitement and wild disorder of active warfare.\r\n\r\n5. Offenses committed in the army are not tried before a civil tribunal,\r\nbut by a military court called a “Court Martial,” for the guidance of\r\nwhich a special code of rules is prepared. These are characterized by the\r\nbrevity, decisiveness, and summary action that is so important to the\r\neffectiveness of all military affairs. The decisions of a court martial\r\nmay impose all punishments even to condemning a man to death; but they\r\nare subject to modification, or commutation, or even may be wholly set\r\naside by the President of the United States, who is Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Army.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of War relate to all things important to the welfare,\r\neffectiveness, and safety of an army, and aim to provide for the comfort\r\nand protect the rights of the individual as well as circumstances permit.\r\nThey consist of one hundred and one articles. The first one requires\r\nevery officer in the army to subscribe to them before he enters on his\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMILITARY HOSPITALS AND ASYLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It is plainly a dictate of humanity that a government should provide\r\nfor the comfort and skillful treatment of those persons who are wounded\r\nin its service, or who become diseased under the hardships of a military\r\nlife and are disabled from active duty. Our century is specially\r\ndistinguished by the benevolent care bestowed on the indigent and the\r\nsuffering, in all civilized countries, and we have reason to expect that\r\nthe United States would take a leading place in this care for her own\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n2. This has been done, and all the thoughtful attention that the case\r\ncalled for has been given to hospitals and asylums for the disabled and\r\nsuffering, both of the Army and Navy, equally in peace and war.\r\n\r\n3. In 1851, Congress passed an act for the establishment of military\r\nasylums, for the purpose of making the same provision for wounded and\r\ndisabled soldiers as had already been made for that class of seamen.\r\nThese institutions are located in different sections of the country where\r\ndeemed most eligible and convenient for those who need such a place of\r\nrefuge. They are placed under the government of a board of commissioners,\r\nconsisting of the general in chief, and eight other military officers of\r\nhigh rank, who submit their acts to the Secretary of War for his approval.\r\n\r\n4. The officers of these asylums must be taken from the army, and consist\r\nof a governor, a deputy governor, and secretary, who is also treasurer.\r\nThe funds for their support are raised by a tax of twenty-five cents\r\nper month on the soldiers, to which are added the fines and penalties\r\nadjudged against soldiers by courts martial, with forfeitures for\r\ndesertion, &c.\r\n\r\nPersons receiving pensions from the government may be admitted into these\r\nasylums upon condition that they surrender their pensions to the use of\r\nthe institution while they remain in it.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners are authorized to buy sites and buildings for these\r\ninstitutions, and to receive donations of them. They also furnish them\r\nwith whatever is necessary for the comfort of the inmates, and make such\r\nlaws and regulations for their government as they deem proper.\r\n\r\nDeserters, mutineers, and habitual drunkards, are excluded from the\r\nbenefits of these asylums.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSANE ASYLUM.\r\n\r\n5. Among these benevolent institutions provided by a generous government\r\nfor the support of those who have faithfully served their country, the\r\ninsane asylum ought to be noticed. The title of this establishment is\r\n“the government hospital for the insane.” Its objects are the cure and\r\nkind treatment of the insane of the army and navy, and of the District\r\nof Columbia. It is under the control of a board of nine visitors, all\r\nof whom must be citizens of the said District. They are appointed by\r\nthe President, and annually report to the Secretary of the Interior the\r\ncondition of the asylum and its inmates. They serve without compensation.\r\n\r\n6. The superintendent must be a physician. There is a farm attached to\r\nthe asylum, which is under the direction of the superintendent, who\r\nreceives patients upon the order of the Secretary of the War, or the\r\nNavy, and upon the order of the Secretary of the Interior. He may receive\r\nindigent insane persons residing in the District of Columbia. If other\r\nthan indigent persons are admitted, they must pay for the privilege a sum\r\nnot less than the cost of their support.\r\n\r\n7. The military hospitals in time of war are for temporary purposes, and\r\nare established wherever the army happens to be, and especially near\r\nwhere the great battles have been fought, that immediate relief may be\r\ngiven to the sick and wounded. These are established by the commanders\r\nof the army, and are under their control. And here let it be recorded to\r\ntheir praise, that since military hospitals were known, never have any\r\nbeen seen which for order, cleanliness and efficiency in administering to\r\nthe comfort and care of the sick and wounded soldiers, surpassed those of\r\nthe United States during the late civil war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position of the United States naturally gives it great prominence as\r\na naval power. Situated between the two great oceans, with thousands of\r\nmiles of coast on each, and a profusion of good harbors, bays, and great\r\nrivers, accessible to large ocean vessels for long distances into the\r\ninterior; with a soil of great fertility, and numerous and inexhaustible\r\nsources of mineral wealth, besides all the conditions favorable to the\r\nestablishment and success of manufactures—it requires large foreign\r\nmarkets for its various products, and an extensive commerce is essential\r\nto its development. It should be, and perhaps it is, the strongest naval\r\npower in the world.\r\n\r\nThe War of Independence was much increased in length and difficulty by\r\nthe want of a navy, the maritime resources of England giving her a great\r\nsuperiority in striking suddenly, and in force, at distant points.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, then, that so important an arm, for both attack and\r\ndefense, should be prepared to act with energy, and this was one of the\r\nfirst cares of the new government; and so efficient did this branch of\r\nnational strength become in the thirty years of peace, to the war of 1812\r\nwith England, that the easiest and some of the most important successes\r\nof the Americans, in that conflict, were on the sea.\r\n\r\nThe care of Naval affairs was, at first, committed to the Secretary of\r\nWar. In 1798 it was erected into a separate Department, and a Secretary\r\nplaced at its head. He was entitled to a seat in the Cabinet, as one of\r\nthe advisers of the President, and received his appointment by nomination\r\nof the President and concurrence of the Senate, in the same manner as the\r\nHeads of other Departments.\r\n\r\nAs the President is the highest officer, in command, in the Navy, he\r\nranks as second, and acts under his direction. It is his duty to procure\r\nnaval stores and materials, and to oversee the places where they are\r\ndeposited; to attend to the construction, equipment, armament, and\r\nemployment of vessels of war, to make out the commissions of naval\r\nofficers; to see that efficiency and discipline are maintained in the\r\nservice; and to assume the control of the movements of the vessels of war\r\nthat are kept cruising in every sea for the protection of our commerce\r\nand citizens in foreign parts, and the preservation of the international\r\nrights and dignity of the United States.\r\n\r\n3. A chief clerk was formerly the second officer in rank in the\r\nDepartment, but, in 1861, provision was made, by Congress, for an\r\nAssistant Secretary, who should act as Secretary in the absence of that\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nFormerly there were five bureaus in this department, but in 1862, three\r\nmore were added, making eight, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. A Bureau of Yards and Docks.\r\n  2. A Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting.\r\n  3. A Bureau of Navigation.\r\n  4. A Bureau of Ordnance.\r\n  5. A Bureau of Construction and Repairs.\r\n  6. A Bureau of Steam Engineering.\r\n  7. A Bureau of Provisions and Clothing.\r\n  8. A Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.\r\n\r\nThe President and Senate appoint all the heads of these bureaus, and\r\nselect them principally from officers of high rank in the navy. They are\r\nall appointed for four years.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary appoints all the numerous clerks employed in the various\r\nbureaus and assigns their duties.\r\n\r\nHe must annually report to Congress the condition of his department,\r\nthe manner and amount of all expenditures, furnish estimates for the\r\nexpenses of the following year, and give such advice in regard to\r\nthe naval interests of the country as his intimate knowledge of that\r\nbranch of the service may suggest. He requires an intimate knowledge of\r\nmaritime affairs, and of International law, and a high and enlightened\r\nappreciation of the policy to be pursued in our official and commercial\r\nintercourse with all foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThe following list embraces the names of all the Secretaries of the Navy,\r\nfrom George Cabot, the first, to George M.

J., June 25, 1869.\r\n    ”          ”     reappointed March 17, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES NAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The original thirteen States were all on the Atlantic coast, and had\r\neach one or more sea ports. They were naturally given to commerce, and\r\nthe second Continental Congress, in December, 1775, resolved to form a\r\nnavy of thirteen vessels of war. Eight were soon fitted out; but the\r\nsuperiority of England on the sea, and the great financial difficulties\r\nwith which Congress had to struggle during, and for some years after,\r\nthe Revolutionary War, made it impossible to give any great degree of\r\ndevelopment to naval affairs. The sea swarmed with American privateers\r\nduring the war, and many hundreds of English merchant vessels were\r\ncaptured; but Congress never was able to collect a formidable fleet.\r\nThe daring exploits of Paul Jones, in European waters, and the bold and\r\nsuccessful raids of Privateersmen under Letters of Marque and Reprisal\r\ngave indication of what might be looked for in the future, but they could\r\nnot cope with British fleets.\r\n\r\n2. The Navy Department was for some time under the control of the\r\nSecretary of War; but, as the finances began to improve, care was taken\r\nto develop this important branch of national power, and a special\r\nSecretary appointed. In the war of 1812 with England 25 years of peace\r\nhad unfitted the people for great _immediate_ success in the army; but\r\nthe navy was the pride and glory of the nation. The disasters attending\r\nmilitary operations for the first year or two were more than compensated\r\nby the brilliant and solid advantages gained by our men of war.\r\n\r\n3. This gave a great impulse to the naval tendencies of the nation, and\r\nit soon became the settled determination of the people to supersede\r\nEngland as the strongest naval power. She had been _Mistress_ of the\r\nSeas; there were strong reasons for our ambition to become _Masters_,\r\nat least in American waters. We had an extensive line of coast, and\r\nour “Monroe Doctrine,” that Americans ought to rule America, and\r\nthat European governments should never be permitted to acquire a\r\npreponderating influence in North America, rendered a strong navy\r\nimportant. Our people, however, are so largely commercial that skillful\r\nmariners are always at command; and the government has never maintained,\r\nin time of peace, a very large naval force.\r\n\r\n4. What they can do in time of need was demonstrated during the\r\nCivil War, when the navy was increased in two years by more than 400\r\nvessels—many of them very expensive and powerful; proving in actual\r\nconflict the inability of the strongest land fortresses to resist them.\r\nThe thousands of miles of the Atlantic and Gulf coast blockade, that was\r\nrendered so effective as to _smother_ the Confederate government, so to\r\nspeak, destroying its finances by rendering its cotton unavailable, is\r\nthe best comment on the naval resources of the United States. The extreme\r\nboldness and vigor with which the Confederate cruisers that managed to\r\nescape the blockade fell on our merchant vessels, and laid waste our\r\ncommerce, is another point in the argument; for they were Americans, and\r\ndemonstrated the natural prowess of Americans on the sea, of which we\r\ncould well be proud but that it did fatal harm to our mercantile marine.\r\n\r\n5. Not half of the vessels belonging to the navy are, however, now (in\r\ntime of peace) in commission—that is, in active service. The rest are\r\neither laid up, or in process of repair. Most of those in commission are\r\nemployed in what is called squadron service. The Secretary of the Navy in\r\na late report enumerates seven of these squadrons; viz.: the European,\r\nthe Asiatic, the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the North Pacific,\r\nthe South Pacific, and the Gulf squadrons. The names given to these\r\nsquadrons indicate their whereabouts, and their cruising grounds. These\r\nsquadrons consist of six, eight, ten, twelve or fifteen vessels, as the\r\nwork to be done may require. It is their duty to visit the seaports of\r\nthe various countries along the coasts of which they cruise, in order to\r\nprotect our merchantmen against pirates or enemies of any description,\r\nwhich may molest them or interfere with their rights and privileges; and\r\nalso to look after the interests and dignity of the United States.\r\n\r\n6. The squadrons are under command of a high naval officer of the rank\r\nof commodore or rear admiral, whose ship is called the flag ship of\r\nthe squadron. Many of our naval officers have distinguished themselves\r\nfor bravery, skill, and patriotic devotion to their country, and have\r\noccupied the highest positions of honor, and the most exalted places in\r\nthe esteem and affection of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, Congress enacted that there should be nine grades of officers in\r\nthe navy, and that their corresponding rank with military officers should\r\nbe as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Rear-Admiral         with      Major-General.\r\n  2. Commodores            ”        Brigadier-Generals.\r\n  3. Captains              ”        Colonels.\r\n  4. Commanders            ”        Lieutenant-Colonels.\r\n  5. Lieut.-Commanders     ”        Majors.\r\n  6. Lieutenants           ”        Captains.\r\n  7. Masters               ”        First-Lieutenants.\r\n  8. Ensigns               ”        Second Lieutenants.\r\n  Midshipmen have no corresponding rank in the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nNAVY YARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We have seen that the Secretary of the Navy has several different\r\nBureaus, having each its separate part of naval interests and stores to\r\ncare for. The material for the equipment of the army is, in large part,\r\nstored in arsenals and armories; in the navy in or near Navy Yards.\r\nHere are gathered such stores and materials as are required for the\r\nconstruction or repairs of vessels, and hundreds of skilled workmen,\r\nconstantly employed in rendering the navy effective; replacing vessels\r\nthat have become unseaworthy, repairing damages, or building such vessels\r\nof special construction as the varying demands of the service may require.\r\n\r\n2. These are established at different places along the coast, most\r\nconvenient for the purpose. There is one at Philadelphia, Pa., at\r\nBrooklyn, N. Y., at Portsmouth, Va., at Pensacola, Fla. Here vessels\r\nare laid up when not in “commission” or active service, or are sent for\r\nrepairs, or to obtain their stores before departing to their distant\r\nstations. All the officers necessary for keeping all these matters in\r\norder are stationed at these yards; and the Navy Department, by these\r\nmeans, preserves the same perfect system of organization and efficiency\r\nas we have seen to characterize other branches of the executive\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVAL ACADEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Naval affairs, quite as much as military, perhaps even more, require\r\nthe aids of science, and a careful and thorough training. Much of this,\r\nindeed, is gained in active service, but for this a basis of scientific\r\nstudy must be laid, and this school of preliminary instruction is called\r\nthe Naval Academy. As a preliminary even to this, the government has\r\nestablished schools on board of ships, for the instruction of boys in\r\nnavigation and naval warfare. These are called apprentices; and for good\r\nconduct and proficiency in their studies, they are advanced to the Naval\r\nAcademy, and placed in the line of promotion.\r\n\r\n2. This school is now established at Annapolis, in the State of Maryland,\r\nnear Washington. Like the Military Academy, it has its superintendent and\r\nprofessors. The pupils are called midshipmen. They are taught navigation\r\nand such other branches of science as are necessary to make them good\r\nseamen and naval officers. They are selected upon nearly the same plan\r\nas cadets. Each Congressional District in every State and Territory is\r\nentitled to send two students to be educated at the Academy. The District\r\nof Columbia is also entitled to send two. Besides which, the President is\r\nallowed to appoint ten additional ones at large, and three more from the\r\nboys enlisted in the navy.\r\n\r\n3. After their graduating examination, if they pass, they are\r\ncommissioned as ensigns in the navy, and rank according to merit. Before\r\nadmission, they are examined according to the regulations made by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, and must be between the ages of fourteen and\r\nseventeen years, sound, robust, and of good constitution.\r\n\r\n4. The course of study in this, as well as in the Military Academy, is\r\nadapted to the profession which the students are expected to follow—the\r\none in the navy, the other in the army. More are educated at these great\r\nnational schools than the government needs in time of peace. Many of the\r\ngraduates are engaged in civil employment. Thus these institutions have\r\nbeen of great service to the country, outside of the army and navy, for\r\nthey have added to the number of well-educated and scientific men, who\r\nmay be useful in any of the walks of life. Their graduates elevate the\r\nstandard of intelligence in the community, especially when they engage in\r\nthe work of instruction.\r\n\r\nBoth of these institutions are supported at the expense of the\r\ngovernment. The tuition and board of cadets in one, and of the midshipmen\r\nin the other, costs them nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVAL OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. An observatory is a building erected for astronomical purposes,\r\nand supplied with the necessary apparatus for studying the heavens. A\r\nthorough knowledge of certain portions of astronomy is indispensable to\r\nthe commander of a vessel, since it is by means of this alone that he\r\ncan ascertain his exact position on the open ocean out of sight of land.\r\nNautical Science and Astronomy have advanced hand in hand; and to perfect\r\nthe former as much as possible the United States Government established\r\nthe Naval Observatory. This institution is located in Washington, and was\r\noriginated by act of Congress in 1842, and put in operation in 1844.\r\n\r\n2. This institution owes more to that enlightened and truly patriotic\r\nPresident, John Q. Adams, than to any other man. He recommended it as far\r\nback as 1823, and again in his first message to Congress. But political\r\nopposition to the man prevented his recommendations from being acted upon\r\ntill nearly 20 years after they were made. This opposition was finally\r\novercome, and we, and posterity after us, will reap the fruits of Mr.\r\nAdams’ suggestions and labors.\r\n\r\n3. The observatory was built and furnished with various astronomical and\r\nphilosophical instruments, and a corps of professors were appointed to\r\nwatch the movements of the heavenly bodies, and to make such observations\r\nand experiments as would enable them to determine many unsettled\r\nquestions which relate to the science of navigation; and incidentally\r\nto another great government work, having especial reference to the same\r\nsubject; that is, the coast survey.\r\n\r\nThe coast survey has already been of great service to the interests of\r\nnavigation—whether national or commercial vessels are regarded—and, when\r\nfinished, much greater benefits are to be expected. When a sufficient\r\nnumber of observations and experiments shall have been made at the naval\r\nobservatory, and published to the world, much valuable information will\r\nbe added to what is already known. And indeed it would be disreputable\r\nto a nation having so large a navy and such a vast number of merchant\r\nships upon the ocean, to do nothing for or add nothing to the science\r\nof navigation. It would be an unwise policy if economy only were\r\nstudied, and we would justly deserve the reproach of being penurious,\r\nshort-sighted, and miserably wanting in disposition to promote the\r\ngeneral good of the world.\r\n\r\n4. The professors are assiduous in their labors, and publish the results\r\nof their observations and the facts they have determined. These are not\r\nonly of use to our own seamen, but to those of all nations who are doing\r\nbusiness on the great deep. Here the charts made by the coast survey are\r\ndeposited, and from hence all our national vessels are furnished with\r\nthem, and with all the nautical instruments they require.\r\n\r\nThe charts, instruments and books relating to astronomy and navigation,\r\nfound here, make it the headquarters and depot of nautical science in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE COAST SURVEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. While the Naval Observatory is a government institution for studying\r\nthe heavens in the interest of the Navy; the Coast Survey is an\r\norganization employed in a thorough and scientific study of the shores of\r\nour country for a sufficient distance out from the land to ascertain all\r\nthe features concealed by the water that may have a bearing on the safety\r\nof our navy and commerce. One examines the heavens, the other the depths\r\nof the waters. They are both of great importance.\r\n\r\n2. This government undertaking has not been as vigorously prosecuted\r\nas some other enterprises conducted by it. As early as 1807, Congress\r\npassed an act authorizing the President to have this work done. Much of\r\nit has been done, yet it is not finished at this day. Our acquisition of\r\nFlorida, Texas, and California has greatly extended our sea coast since\r\nthe work was commenced, and its accomplishment has cost more time and\r\nlabor than was anticipated at the beginning, yet we think it ought to\r\nhave been completed in much less than 60 years.\r\n\r\n3. This work, like that relating to light houses, is under the management\r\nof a board, consisting of a superintendent, two principal assistants,\r\ntwo naval officers, and four officers of the army. These nine constitute\r\nthe board. Then there are as many officers of the army and navy\r\nemployed in the execution of the work as are deemed necessary. And the\r\npublic vessels, by direction of the President, may be used in order to\r\nfacilitate the work, for much of it must be done at sea. The survey\r\nextends 20 leagues from the shore. The surveyors must make accurate\r\ncharts of the whole coast, in which are laid down all the islands,\r\nshoals, roads or anchorage grounds within twenty leagues of any part\r\nof the shore of the United States. The courses or distances between\r\nthe principal capes or headlands must be laid down, together with the\r\nsoundings (depths of water) and everything else necessary to make a\r\ncomplete and accurate chart of every part of our coasts.\r\n\r\n4. An annual report of this work must be made to Congress in December of\r\neach year, accompanied with charts, showing the progress of the work, the\r\nnumber of persons employed, the expenses incurred, the amount of work\r\nfinished, and what is unfinished. These reports and charts are carefully\r\npreserved, and copies of them may be had at Washington for the use of our\r\nnaval and merchant ships, to which they are of great service, as guides,\r\nwhenever they are on or near the coast. This work, in its utility, is not\r\nconfined to ourselves; but the important information obtained by it is\r\nof great use to the navigators of all nations who come into our ports or\r\ncruise on our coasts. They derive the same benefits from this work that\r\nwe derive from theirs of the same kind. It is creditable to any nation to\r\ndo such things as are beneficial to the world, such acts as contribute\r\nto the welfare of humanity. Shipwrecks belong to the list of terrible\r\ncalamities which often befall those “who go down to the sea in ships,\r\nthat do business in great waters.” Whoever diminishes these is a public\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nLIGHT HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. These, with Buoys, and Beacons, are a necessary practical supplement\r\nto the labors of the Coast Survey. Buoys and Beacons indicate the shoals,\r\nor dangerous rocks and reefs beneath the surface of the water, in the\r\ndaytime; while light houses indicate the same, and show the mariner the\r\nbearings of the land, in the night; and, by studying, in connection with\r\nthese, the charts of the coast supplied by the Coast Survey, he may make\r\nhis way as securely in the night or day through the concealed dangers of\r\nthe treacherous waters as a landsman along a beaten highway. They are\r\nway-marks along the sea coast, at the entrance of harbors, and on lakes\r\nand rivers. They speak a language very well understood by the seaman; and\r\nare invaluable for the protection of his vessel from the dangers of the\r\nDeep.\r\n\r\n2. Keepers are appointed by the government to keep them in repair, and\r\nto see that they are properly lighted every night. We have no means of\r\nknowing the number of these useful establishments, but there must be\r\nseveral hundred of them; for we have more sea coast than any other nation\r\nupon the globe, with a still greater length of lake and river shore. They\r\nare located at prominent points, and at dangerous places, all along the\r\nextensive lines of coast and shores.\r\n\r\n3. To the end that light houses should be constructed and kept in repair,\r\nand that competent men might have the whole matter in charge, a law of\r\n1852 authorized the President to appoint two officers of the navy of high\r\nrank, one officer of the corps of engineers of the army, one officer\r\nof the topographical engineers, and two civilians of high scientific\r\nattainments, to form a LIGHT HOUSE BOARD for the United States. This\r\nboard is attached to the Treasury Department, and the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury superintends its operations. The board has in charge the\r\nbuilding, illumination, and inspection of light houses, light vessels,\r\nbuoys, beacons, sea marks, and their appendages.\r\n\r\n4. The Secretary of the Treasury is president of the board, and may\r\nconvene them whenever he deems it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe law makes it the duty of the board to divide the whole of the sea,\r\ngulf, and lake coasts, into light house districts; not exceeding 12 in\r\nnumber. An officer of the army or navy is assigned to each district, as a\r\nlight house inspector.\r\n\r\nThey have the control of everything relating to light houses, light\r\nships, buoys, beacons, or other means of directing vessels in and out of\r\nport, or of guiding them while sailing along the coast in the night.\r\n\r\n5. As foreign vessels receive the same benefits from our light houses\r\nas our own, there is nothing unfair or illiberal in requiring them to\r\ncontribute something towards the expense of maintaining them. For this\r\npurpose Congress has imposed a tax, or laid a duty of 50 cents per ton\r\non all foreign vessels entering any ports of the United States. This is\r\ncalled “LIGHT MONEY.” It is collected in the same way as tonnage duties\r\nare, _i. e._, by the collector of the port where the ship arrives. Light\r\nmoney is not required of vessels owned by citizens of the United States,\r\nprovided that they are regularly registered as the law directs, or have a\r\nsea letter.\r\n\r\n7. A sea letter is a document or certificate, given by the collector of a\r\nport, to the captain of an American vessel, certifying that she belongs\r\nto a citizen or citizens of the United States. Armed with this, the\r\ncaptain can prove to all whom it may concern, anywhere in the world, the\r\nownership and nationality of his vessel. This is a protection to her and\r\nher cargo, especially in times of war. It is one of a ship’s papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nLETTERS OF MARQUE AND REPRISAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The somewhat barbarous custom has prevailed among nations, from early\r\ntimes, of making war in every possible way upon the citizens of a hostile\r\ncountry, and of taking or destroying their property, on the principle\r\nthat injury to the citizens of the power warred against would diminish\r\nits power of defense and attack.\r\n\r\nThis has been carried into effect on the sea by authorizing private\r\nvessels to be fitted out for warlike purposes and preying on the commerce\r\nof the enemy. Such authority is given by Letters of Marque and Reprisal.\r\nThe Constitution confers on Congress the power to do this; and Congress\r\nauthorizes the President to do it. A law was passed in 1863 expressly\r\nconveying it to him.\r\n\r\n2. It is a formal commission given to the commander of a private armed\r\nvessel, called a privateer, authorizing him to capture the ships and\r\ngoods of the subjects of a nation with which we are at war. When such\r\nletters are issued by the United States they are signed by the President\r\nand sealed with the great seal. Without such commission, thus signed\r\nand sealed, any capture made by the commander of a private vessel\r\nwould be piracy. If a capture is made, it must be made according to\r\nthe laws of war, as recognized by civilized nations, and according to\r\nthe instructions given by the President. Any conduct on the part of a\r\nprivateer, contrary to these rules, would vitiate his proceedings, and he\r\nwould not be entitled to the property he had captured.\r\n\r\n3. The captured vessel is called a prize, and must be taken into some\r\nport of the United States, or into some port of a country in amity with\r\nthe United States, where legal proceedings are taken before some court\r\nof competent jurisdiction; and the capture and all the circumstances of\r\nit inquired into; and if all is found to have been done according to the\r\nlaws of civilized nations, the captured vessel and cargo is condemned\r\nas a prize. But if not condemned, the captors lose her. When adjudged\r\nto be a lawful prize, the ship and cargo are sold, and the money is\r\ndivided between the officers and men, according to rank, and according\r\nto the laws of Congress on this subject. These laws give the whole to\r\nthe captors, when the ship taken is of equal or superior force to the\r\nship making the capture; but if of inferior force, then the United States\r\ntakes one-half.\r\n\r\n4. Privateering, as this business is called, was once considered a\r\nlawful and honorable mode of warfare. It was generally practiced between\r\nbelligerent nations; but in later days its propriety and morality have\r\nbeen questioned. It is beginning to be looked upon as a kind of robbery\r\nnot very distantly related to piracy. That it is robbery no one can deny,\r\nand, query, “Can it be justified on the ground that the robber and the\r\nrobbed are the subjects of nations at war with each other?”\r\n\r\n5. In Europe an effort has been made to do away with this species of\r\nwarfare. We hope it will yet succeed, and that all nations will agree\r\nto abolish this system of plunder. Innocent parties are generally the\r\nsufferers, while but small injury is done to the power of the hostile\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nNAVY AND MARINE HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. These institutions are still more important for sailors than for\r\nsoldiers; as the sailor is more likely to have lost his adaptation to any\r\nkind of business on land, and to lose sight of family relations by reason\r\nof his long absences to foreign regions. The government very early took\r\nthis subject in hand and made ample, and extremely comfortable, provision\r\nfor disabled seamen belonging to its navy.\r\n\r\n2. In 1811 an act was passed to establish navy hospitals, for the\r\nexclusive use of such seamen as belonged to the navy. This new\r\ninstitution was at first placed under the management of a board of\r\ncommissioners known as the commissioners of navy hospitals. This\r\ncommission consisted of the Secretaries of the Navy, Treasury, and War.\r\nBut in 1832 this was changed, and the Secretary of the Navy was made\r\nsole trustee of the navy hospital fund, which was made up of $50,000\r\nappropriated by Congress for that purpose, together with twenty cents per\r\nmonth collected from seamen belonging to the navy, and the fines imposed\r\non navy officers, seamen, and marines.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners were authorized to purchase or erect suitable buildings\r\nfor navy hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARINE HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\n3. These are located near important seaports. At these places seamen\r\ndepart for, and arrive from their voyages, and are found in the greatest\r\nnumbers; and here the funds for the support of the marine hospitals are\r\ncollected, as is the tonnage on ships, viz.: by the collectors of the\r\nports. For this purpose the law authorizes the collectors of customs\r\nto demand and receive the sum of twenty cents per month from the wages\r\nof every sailor; and every master of a vessel is obliged to render to\r\nthe collector an accurate account of the number of seamen on board his\r\nvessel, and of the time they have been employed by him, since his last\r\nentry into any port of the United States. These twenty cents the captain\r\nmust pay the collector, but he is allowed to deduct it from each seaman’s\r\nwages. In this manner the funds for the building, furnishing, and support\r\nof the marine hospitals are raised. The collectors of the ports pay\r\nthem into the United States Treasury, and the Treasurer disburses them\r\nto the directors of the hospitals as they are needed. The directors are\r\nappointed by the President. They appropriate the funds, and have the\r\ngeneral direction and management of the institutions.\r\n\r\n4. These provisions are contained in an act entitled, “An act for the\r\nrelief of sick and disabled seamen,” passed in 1798. Seamen, whether\r\nin the merchant service or in the naval service of the United States,\r\nwere indiscriminately taxed for the support of these hospitals; and\r\nboth have the same rights, privileges and benefits in them. The money\r\nthus collected from seamen is called “hospital money,” and the fund is\r\ndenominated “the marine hospital fund.” In 1864 there were 24 marine\r\nhospitals in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. At the first general census, in 1790, there were but little over three\r\nmillions and a half of inhabitants in the United States, and these mostly\r\nsettled along the Atlantic seaboard; the country was oppressed with\r\ndebt, and not recovered from the effects of a desolating war. Its public\r\nbusiness, therefore, was comparatively small in amount, and was readily\r\nmanaged by the three Departments, of State, of the Treasury, and of War.\r\nThe energy of the people, and the great resources at their command,\r\nenabled them to surmount all their difficulties in a short time, and the\r\ncountry entered on a career of remarkable prosperity. Its public business\r\nkept pace with the general expansion, and new departments were from time\r\nto time created, to improve the efficiency of the public service.\r\n\r\n2. In 1849 Congress passed a law creating the Department of the Interior,\r\nand a Secretary of the Interior, having a seat in the Cabinet, appointed\r\nin the same manner, and possessing the same rank, as the other members of\r\nthe Cabinet, was installed in office.\r\n\r\n3. The bureau of the Commissioner of Patents was transferred from the\r\nDepartment of State, and the General Land Office from that of the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nThe supervisory power before exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nover the accounts of the marshals, clerks, and other officers of all\r\nthe courts of the United States, was placed in the hands of the new\r\nSecretary. The office of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, heretofore\r\nattached to the War Department, was also transferred to this; and the\r\npowers and duties of the Secretary of War, in relation to Indian affairs,\r\nwere devolved on the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n4. The Secretaries of War and of the Navy were by the same act relieved\r\nof their duties in regard to the Commissioner of Pensions, and those\r\nduties were thereafter to be performed by the Secretary of the new\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau, heretofore attached to the State Department, and\r\nthe duties of the Secretary of State in relation thereto, were also\r\ntransferred to this department.\r\n\r\nTo the Secretary was also given the supervisory power over the lead and\r\nother mines belonging to the United States, heretofore executed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the President over the Commissioners of Public Buildings\r\nwere also transferred to him.\r\n\r\n5. He was also charged with the control over the Board of Inspectors and\r\nWarden of the Penitentiary of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has the same power in appointing and\r\nremoving clerks and other subordinates in his department, that the\r\nSecretaries of the other departments had over these several bureaus\r\nbefore they were transferred to this department.\r\n\r\nThis office has a seal, which must be affixed to the commissions of all\r\nits subordinate officers.\r\n\r\nThe President and Senate appoint the Assistant Secretaries.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is easy to understand what branches of the public\r\nservice are conducted in this office, and what are the duties of its\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n6. The following is a list of all who have filled the office of Secretary\r\nof the Interior since the establishment of the department:\r\n\r\n  Thomas H. Ewing, Ohio, March 7, 1849.\r\n  T. M. T. McKennan, Pa., 1850.\r\n  Alexander H. H. Stuart, Va., Sept. 12, 1850.\r\n  Robert McClelland, Mich., March 5, 1853.\r\n  Jacob Thompson, Miss., March 6, 1857.\r\n  Caleb B. Smith, Ind., March 5, 1861.\r\n  John P. Usher, Ind., Jan. 7, 1863.\r\n  James Harlan, Iowa, 1865.\r\n  Orville H. Browning, Ill., 1866.\r\n  Jacob D. Cox, Ohio, March 5, 1869.\r\n  Columbus Delano, Ohio, Nov. 1, 1870.\r\n      ”       ”    reappointed March 17, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ALL the land in the United States, to which individuals or\r\ncorporations have not acquired a legal title, is held by the general\r\ngovernment. This includes the land, or the part of it not under special\r\nreservation, belonging to the Indians. As the settlements push on into\r\nthe territory roamed over by the thinly scattered Indian tribes, an\r\nequitable arrangement is made with them, by which certain Reservations,\r\nlarge enough for their purposes are set aside for their occupation; and\r\nan indemnity, commonly in the form of an annuity, is made them for the\r\nlands to which they renounce their right. As they are gradually melting\r\naway, their lands will soon become all, or nearly all, the property of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n2. The lands free for settlement are sold under certain regulations; and\r\ngiven to certain classes—to soldiers, to actual settlers for Homesteads,\r\nto corporations to aid in promoting the public welfare—as Railroads and\r\nColleges—and to support education in various ways; and the remainder held\r\nuntil required for use in the expansion of the country.\r\n\r\nNearly 200,000,000 acres have been given to assist in building railroads\r\nthrough unsettled parts of the country. A large part of this, however,\r\nhas been only conditionally given, and not yet appropriated by the\r\ncorporations. Many millions more have been given to the States as a fund\r\nin aid of public schools and collegiate institutions—and one thirty-sixth\r\npart is reserved, in every new township surveyed, for the benefit of\r\npublic schools in that township. The rest is sold, at very low rates, to\r\nany who will buy.\r\n\r\n3. To manage this property a bureau was established by act of Congress,\r\nin 1812, called The General Land Office. It was under the oversight of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury until 1849, when the Department of the\r\nInterior was established, to which it was then transferred. Its head is\r\ncalled\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE.\r\n\r\n4. He is appointed by the President and Senate, must take the usual\r\nofficial oath before entering on his duties, and must give the usual\r\nofficial bond. He keeps the seal of his office, and fixes an impression\r\nof it upon all papers emanating from the Land Office. He, with his clerks\r\nand assistants, forms the bureau, keeps all the records and papers\r\npertaining to the public lands, and performs all duties relating thereto.\r\nHe receives reports from surveyors and from the district land officers,\r\ngives them their instructions, and reports to the President and to\r\nCongress when required to do so.\r\n\r\nHe issues all patents for lands granted by the United States, and sends\r\nand receives by mail all papers and documents relating to his official\r\nbusiness, at public expense. Every patent for land is issued in the name\r\nof the United States, is signed by the President and by the Commissioner\r\nof the Land Office, and is then recorded in books kept for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEYORS GENERAL AND DEPUTY SURVEYORS.\r\n\r\n5. When it is deemed necessary and expedient to bring the lands in any\r\nparticular State or section of the country into market, a surveyor\r\ngeneral is appointed for that State or section, and also a sufficient\r\nnumber of deputy or assistant surveyors to perform the work; which is\r\ndone under the direction of the surveyor general, who is himself directed\r\nby law as to the manner of procedure. He is appointed for four years,\r\ntaking the usual oath, and gives bonds for the faithful performance of\r\nhis duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS.\r\n\r\n6. The law directs how the lands shall be surveyed and mapped. Where\r\nit is practicable, they are laid out into square miles, each of which\r\ncontains 640 acres, and is called a section.\r\n\r\nThese sections are then sub-divided into halves, quarters, and eighths\r\nof sections; that is, into lots of 320, 160, and 80 acres. The boundary\r\nlines are all run north and south, and east and west. Thirty-six of these\r\nsections, which make a plat of six miles square, are put into a township.\r\nThese townships are designated by numbers, but when inhabited are named\r\nby the inhabitants as their fancy dictates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALE OF THE PUBLIC LANDS.\r\n\r\n7. After the lands have been surveyed and properly mapped into townships\r\nand sections, they are brought into market and offered for sale in such\r\nquantities as are wanted by the purchaser; from 40 acres, one-sixteenth\r\nof a section, up to a whole section; or as many sections as the buyer\r\npleases to take.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRICT LAND OFFICES.\r\n\r\n8. District land offices for the sale of lands are established for this\r\npurpose at as many places in the State or Territory where the lands are\r\nsituated, as is deemed necessary for the convenience of purchasers. Here\r\nare kept maps of all the lands lying in the district, and buyers may make\r\ntheir selections both of quantity and location as suits them. Here they\r\nwill find\r\n\r\n\r\nA REGISTER OF THE LAND OFFICE AND A RECEIVER OF PUBLIC MONEY FOR LANDS.\r\n\r\n9. The first named officer will register the application made for land\r\nin a book kept for that purpose, and the second will receive the money\r\npaid for it. These officers are appointed by the President and Senate,\r\nand report their proceedings to the General Land Office at Washington.\r\nThe receiver transmits all moneys received by him to the United States\r\nTreasury once in a month or once in three months, as directed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL LANDS.\r\n\r\n10. As before stated, the public lands are surveyed into sections of\r\none mile square, and thirty-six of these sections make a township. For\r\nthe purpose of encouraging education, Congress has enacted that section\r\nnumber 16, in every township, shall not be sold, but reserved for the\r\ntownship, to be applied to the support of common schools in that town.\r\nBy this measure the government appropriated one thirty-sixth part of its\r\nlands to aid the work of educating the children in the new States. And in\r\naddition to this it has made other munificent donations of land for the\r\nestablishment and support of colleges and other institutions of learning.\r\n\r\n11. In addition to all this the United States have donated large tracts\r\nof land to the several States in which it lay, to aid them in building\r\ntheir State houses, &c. Large quantities of land have also been given to\r\naid the construction of railroads.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMESTEADS.\r\n\r\n12. The government has always sold its lands at a very low price,\r\npreferring to give the people cheap farms, rather than to raise more\r\nrevenue from this source.\r\n\r\nBut in 1862, Congress passed an act called “the Homestead Law,” the\r\nobject of which was to cheapen the public lands to a mere nominal price\r\nto heads of families, male or female, or to persons 21 years of age or\r\nover, or to persons who had served in the army or navy of the United\r\nStates, whether 21 years old or not. By the provisions of this act such\r\npersons are allowed, for the trifling sum of ten dollars, to enter upon\r\nand claim 160 acres of land, provided the claimant swears that the land\r\nis applied for his or her own use, and for settlement and cultivation.\r\nBut no patent (deed) is to be given until the applicant has actually\r\nsettled upon and cultivated the land for the space of five years. Such\r\napplicant must also make affidavit that he has never borne arms against\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nBy this liberal policy, persons of very limited means may provide\r\nthemselves with comfortable homes for life; and the unoccupied lands\r\nwill be settled and occupied faster than if the old price of one dollar\r\nand twenty-five cents per acre had been demanded. The revenue from the\r\nsale of lands will of course be less, but the wealth of the country will\r\nundoubtedly be increased by the measure.\r\n\r\n13. Exceedingly rich and valuable mines of gold, silver, copper, lead\r\nand other minerals have been found upon the public lands. That the\r\nbenefits of mining them might be extended to the many, instead of being\r\nmonopolized by a few, a different rule for selling them has been made.\r\nAfter they have been surveyed, mapped and described, they, like other\r\nlands, are offered for sale, but in quantities of not more than 40 acres.\r\nThese are generally sold at auction, but no bid less than five dollars\r\nper acre will be received. If not sold at public sale, they are then\r\nsubject to private sale at that price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nHOW TO SECURE PUBLIC LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of public lands subject to entry; one at $1.25 per\r\nacre, known as _minimum_, and one at $2.50, known as _double minimum_,\r\nthe latter being the alternate sections along the lines of railroads.\r\nTitle may be acquired by purchase at public sale, or by “private entry,”\r\nand in virtue of the Pre-emption and Homestead Laws.\r\n\r\n_At Public Sale._—Lands are offered at auction to the highest bidder,\r\npursuant to proclamation or public notice.\r\n\r\n_Private Entry._—Lands subject to private entry, are those which have\r\nbeen once offered at public sale without finding purchasers. In order to\r\nacquire title to these lands, a written application must be made to the\r\nLand Register of the District in which the land is located, describing\r\nthe tract desired. The Register certifies the fact to the Receiver,\r\nstating price, and the applicant then pays the money and takes a receipt,\r\nand at the close of the month the Register and Receiver make return of\r\nthe sale to the General Land Office, when a patent or full title issues\r\non due surrender of the receipt, and will be delivered at the option\r\nof the purchaser, at the General Land Office in Washington, or by the\r\nRegister at the District Land Office.\r\n\r\n_Land Warrants._—When lands are to be located with land warrants,\r\napplication must be made as in cash cases, accompanied by an assigned\r\nwarrant. When the tract is $2.50 per acre, $1.25 per acre must be paid in\r\naddition to the warrant. Receipts are given and patents delivered, as in\r\nthe preceding case. At the time of location, a fee of 50 cents for a 40\r\nacre warrant, and a corresponding amount for larger ones, must be paid to\r\nthe Register, and a like sum to the Receiver.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural College Scrip._—This may be used in the location of lands\r\nat private entry, but is only applicable to lands subject to entry at\r\n$1.25 per acre, and is restricted to a technical “quarter section,” and\r\nto three sections in each township of land. The proceeding to acquire\r\ntitle is the same as in cash and warrant cases, the fees being the same\r\nas on warrants. This scrip may be used in payment of pre-emption claims.\r\n\r\n_Pre-emption._—Any person being the head of a family, or widow, or\r\nsingle man over 21 years of age, and a citizen of the United States,\r\nor a person who has filed his declaration to become such, by settling\r\nupon and improving any of the “offered,” “unoffered,” or unsurveyed\r\nlands of the United States, may obtain a pre-emption right to purchase\r\n160 acres so occupied, at the regular government price, whether it be\r\n$1.25 or $2.50 per acre. Where the tract is “offered” land, the settler\r\nmust file with the District Land Office his statement as to the fact\r\nof settlement, within thirty days thereafter, and within one year must\r\nmake proof to the Land Office, of his actual residence and cultivation,\r\nand secure the land by payment in cash or Land Warrant. Where the land\r\nhas been surveyed and not offered at public sale, the statement must be\r\nfiled within three months after settlement, and payment made within 21\r\nmonths. Where settlement is made upon unsurveyed lands, the settler is\r\nrequired to file a statement within three months after the survey, and\r\npay within eighteen months thereafter. No person is entitled to more than\r\none pre-emption right.\r\n\r\n_The Homestead Privilege._—The Homestead laws give to every citizen\r\nthe right to a Homestead of 160 acres minimum, or eighty acres double\r\nminimum. To obtain Homestead, applicant must swear that he is the head\r\nof a family, or over the age of twenty-one, a citizen, or has declared\r\nhis intention to become such; and that the entry is for his exclusive\r\nuse and benefit, and for actual settlement and cultivation. When an\r\napplicant has made actual settlement upon the land he desires, he must\r\nmake affidavit of the fact before the Land Register, and pay fees\r\namounting, on 160 acres of minimum land, to $18, or an equal sum for\r\neighty acres of double minimum, for which he gets a receipt; and after\r\nfive years’ occupation and cultivation of the land, he is entitled upon\r\nproof of such cultivation to a patent or full title to the Homestead. Any\r\nloyal person in the naval or military service of the United States, may\r\nacquire a Homestead by reason of his family occupying land and making\r\nthe application in his stead. All officers, soldiers, and sailors who\r\nhave served in the army or navy for ninety days and remained loyal, may\r\nenter 160 instead of 80 acres of double minimum lands. The fees above for\r\nentering Homestead apply to surveyed lands in Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa,\r\nMissouri, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. In California,\r\nNevada, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington Territory, Arizona,\r\nIdaho, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana, the fees are $22 instead of $18. A\r\nsettler having filed a pre-emption declaration, may change his filing\r\ninto Homestead, and receive the benefit of the Homestead laws. If a\r\nHomestead settler does not wish to remain five years on his land before\r\nobtaining title, he may pay for it in cash or Land Warrants. Lands\r\nobtained under the Homestead laws are exempt from liability for debts\r\ncontracted prior to the issuing of the patent.\r\n\r\n_United States Land Offices_ are located at Fort Des Moines, Council\r\nBluffs, Fort Dodge and Sioux City, Iowa; Menasha, Falls of St. Croix,\r\nStevens’ Point, La Crosse, Bayfield and Eau Claire, Wisconsin; San\r\nFrancisco, Marysville, Humboldt, Stockton, Visalia, Sacramento, and Los\r\nAngeles, California; West Point, Beatrice, Lincoln, Dakota City, and\r\nGrand Island, Nebraska; Taylor’s Falls, St. Cloud, Du Luth, Alexandria,\r\nJackson, New Ulm, and Litchfield, Minnesota; Oregon City, Roseburg, and\r\nLe Grand, Oregon; Topeka, Junction City, Humboldt, and Augusta, Kansas;\r\nCarson City, Austin, Belmont, and Aurora, Nevada; Vermilion, Springfield,\r\nand Pembina, Dakota; Denver City, Fair Play, and Central City, Colorado;\r\nBoonville, Ironton, and Springfield, Missouri; Mobile, Huntsville, and\r\nMontgomery, Alabama; New Orleans, Monroe, Natchiloches, Louisiana;\r\nDetroit, East Saginaw, Iona, Marquette, and Traverse City, Michigan;\r\nLittle Rock, Washington, and Clarksville, Arkansas; Boise City, and\r\nLewiston, Idaho; Chillicothe, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Springfield,\r\nIllinois; Jackson, Mississippi; Tallahassee, Florida; Olympia, and\r\nVancouver, Washington Territory; Helena, Montana; Prescott, Arizona; Salt\r\nLake City, Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRE-EMPTION LAWS.\r\n\r\nA pre-emption right is the right of a squatter upon the lands of the\r\nUnited States to purchase, in preference to others, when the land is\r\nsold. Such right is granted to the following persons: Any citizen of the\r\nUnited States; any person who has filed his declaration of intention\r\nto become a citizen; any head of a family; any widow; any single woman\r\nof the age of twenty-one years or over; and any person who has made a\r\nsettlement, erected a dwelling-house upon, and is an inhabitant of the\r\ntract sought to be entered—_provided_ such settlement was made since June\r\n1, 1840, and previously to the time of application for the land, which\r\nland must, at the date of the settlement, have had the Indian title\r\nextinguished, and been surveyed by the United States.\r\n\r\nA person bringing himself within the above requirements by proof\r\nsatisfactory to the Register and Receiver of the land district in which\r\nthe land may lie, taken pursuant to the rules hereafter prescribed,\r\nwill, after having taken the affidavit required by the Act, be entitled\r\nto enter, by legal subdivisions, any number of acres, not exceeding one\r\nhundred and sixty, or a quarter-section, to include his residence; and\r\nhe may avail himself of the same at any time prior to the day of the\r\ncommencement of the public sale, including said tract, where the land has\r\nnot yet been proclaimed.\r\n\r\nWhere the land was subject to private entry, June 1, 1840, and a\r\nsettlement shall thereafter be made upon such land, or where the land\r\nshall become hereafter subject to private entry, and after that period\r\na settlement shall be made, which the settler is desirous of securing,\r\nnotice of such intention must be given within thirty days after such\r\nsettlement; and, in all such cases, the proof, affidavit and payment must\r\nbe made within twelve months after such settlement.\r\n\r\nThe tracts liable to entry are embraced under the following designations:\r\n_First_, a regular quarter-section, notwithstanding the quantity may\r\nvary a few acres from one hundred and sixty; or a quarter-section,\r\nwhich, though fractional in quantity by the passage of a navigable\r\nstream through the same, is still bounded by regular sectional and\r\nquarter-sectional lines; _second_, a fractional section containing\r\nnot over one hundred and sixty acres, or any tract being a detached\r\nor anomalous survey made pursuant to law, and not exceeding such\r\nquantity; _third_, two adjoining half-quarter-sections (in all cases\r\nto be separated by a north and south line, except on the north side\r\nof township, where the surveys are so made as to throw the excess or\r\ndeficiency on the north and west sides of the township), of the regular\r\nquarters mentioned in the first designation; _fourth_, two half-quarter\r\nor eighty-acre subdivisions of a fractional or broken section, adjoining\r\neach other, the aggregate quantity not exceeding one hundred and sixty\r\nacres; _fifth_, a regular half-quarter and an adjoining fractional\r\nsection, or an adjoining half-quarter subdivision of a fractional\r\nsection, the aggregate quantity not exceeding one hundred and sixty\r\nacres; _sixth_, if the pre-emptor do not wish to enter one hundred and\r\nsixty acres, he may enter a single half-quarter section (made by a north\r\nand south line), or an eighty-acre subdivision of a fractional section;\r\n_seventh_, one or more adjoining forty-acre lots may be entered, the\r\naggregate not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres; and, _eighth_,\r\na regular half-quarter, a half-quarter subdivision, or a fractional\r\nsection, may each be taken, with one or more forty-acre subdivisions\r\nlying adjoining, the aggregate not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres.\r\nForty-acre tracts, or quarter quarter-sections, may be entered in the\r\nsame manner that eighty-acre, or half-quarter sections, have been.\r\n\r\nOnly one person upon a quarter-section is protected, and he the one who\r\nmade the first settlement, provided he conform to the other provisions\r\nof the law. A person who has once availed himself of the provisions\r\nof the Pre-emption Act, cannot, at any future period, or at any other\r\nland office, acquire any other right under it. No person, who is the\r\nproprietor of three hundred and twenty acres of land in any State or\r\nTerritory of the United States, or who quits or abandons his residence on\r\nhis own land to reside on the public land in the same State or Territory,\r\nis entitled to the benefit of the Pre-emption Acts.\r\n\r\nThe approval of the tracts by the local land office is the evidence\r\nof the survey; but the land is to be construed as surveyed when the\r\nrequisite lines are run on the field, and the corners established by the\r\ndeputy surveyor. No assignment or transfers of pre-emption rights are\r\nrecognized at the land office; the patents issuing to the claimants, in\r\nwhose names alone the entries are made.\r\n\r\nThe following description of lands are not liable to entry: _first_,\r\nlands included in any reservation by any treaty, law, or proclamation of\r\nthe President of the United States, and lands reserved for salines and\r\nfor other purposes; _second_, lands reserved for the support of schools;\r\n_third_, lands acquired by either of the last two treaties with the Miami\r\nIndians in Indiana, or which may be acquired of the Wyandot Indians in\r\nOhio, or any other Indian reservation, to which the title has been, or\r\nmay be extinguished at any time during the operation of the Pre-emption\r\nActs, by the United States; _fourth_, sections of lands reserved to the\r\nUnited States, alternate to other sections granted to any State for\r\nthe construction of any canal, railroad, or other public improvement;\r\n_fifth_, sections, or fractions of sections, included within the limits\r\nof any incorporated town; _sixth_, every portion of the public lands\r\nwhich has been selected as a site for a city or town; _seventh_, every\r\nparcel or lot of land actually settled and occupied for the purposes of\r\ntrade and agriculture; and, _eighth_, all lands in which are situated any\r\nknown salines or mines.\r\n\r\nPersons claiming the benefit of the Pre-emption Acts are required to\r\nfile duplicate affidavits, such as are specified by law, and to furnish\r\nproof, by one or more disinterested witnesses, of the facts necessary\r\nto establish the requisites mentioned in the first paragraph of this\r\narticle; such witnesses having first been duly sworn or affirmed by some\r\ncompetent authority.\r\n\r\nIf adverse claims are made to the same tract, each claimant is to be\r\nnotified of the time and place of taking testimony, and allowed to\r\ncross-examine the opposite witnesses, and to furnish counter-proof,\r\nitself subject to cross-examination. If, by reason of distance, sickness,\r\nor infirmity, the witnesses cannot personally appear before the register\r\nof the land office, their depositions, taken in conformity with the\r\nfollowing regulations, may be received:\r\n\r\nThe notice to adverse claimants must be in writing, and served in time to\r\nallow at least one day for every twenty miles which the party may have to\r\ntravel in going to the place of taking evidence. The proof, in all cases,\r\nshould consist of a simple detail of facts merely, and not of broad and\r\ngeneral statements. If the pre-emptor be “the head of a family,” the\r\nwitnesses must state the facts constituting him such; whether he be a\r\nhusband having a wife and children, or a widower, or an unmarried person\r\nunder twenty-one years of age, having a family, either of relatives or\r\nothers, dependent upon him, or hired persons. All the facts relative to\r\nthe settlement in person, inhabitancy, or personal residence, the time of\r\nits commencement, the manner and extent of its continuance, as also those\r\nsharing the apparent objects, must be stated. It must be stated that the\r\nclaimant made the settlement on the land in person; that he has erected a\r\ndwelling upon the land; that he lived in the same, and made it his home,\r\netc. In the event of a decision by the land officer against the claimant,\r\nhe may appeal to the Commissioner of the Land Office at Washington.\r\n\r\nNo entry will be permitted until the affidavit required of the claimant\r\nis taken. Duplicates thereof must be signed by the claimant, and the fact\r\nof the oath being taken must be certified by the register or receiver\r\nadministering the same; one copy to be filed in the Register’s office,\r\nand the other to be sent to the Land Office at Washington.\r\n\r\nA purchaser of public land is only required to make written application\r\nto the Register of the local land office for the tract desired to be\r\nentered, and to pay to the Receiver the purchase money therefor. Blank\r\nforms of such application are furnished gratuitously at the Land Office\r\nwhere the tract is desired to be entered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS’ HOMESTEAD LAW OF 1872.\r\n\r\nThe following is the full text of the Amendatory Soldiers’ Homestead\r\nBill, approved by the President on the 3d of April, 1872.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_: That every private soldier and\r\nofficer who has served in the army of the United States during the recent\r\nrebellion for ninety days or more, and who was honorably discharged,\r\nand has remained loyal to the government, including the troops mustered\r\ninto the service of the United States by virtue of the third section\r\nof an act entitled “An act making appropriations for completing the\r\ndefenses of Washington, and for other purposes,” approved February 13th,\r\n1862, and every seaman, marine, and officer who has served in the navy\r\nof the United States, or in the marine corps, during the rebellion, for\r\nninety days, and who was honorably discharged, and has remained loyal\r\nto the government, shall, on compliance with the provisions of an act\r\nentitled “An act to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the public\r\ndomain,” and the acts amendatory thereof, as hereinafter modified, be\r\nentitled to enter upon and receive patents for a quantity of public\r\nlands (not mineral) not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres, or\r\none quarter-section, to be taken in compact form according to legal\r\nsubdivision, including the alternate reserved section of public lands\r\nalong the line of any railroad or other public work not otherwise\r\nreserved or appropriated, and other lands subject to entry under the\r\nhomestead laws of the United States: _Provided_, the said homestead\r\nsettler shall be allowed six months after locating his homestead within\r\nwhich to commence his settlement and improvements: _And provided also_,\r\nthe time which the homestead settler shall have served in the army, navy,\r\nor marine corps aforesaid shall be deducted from the time heretofore\r\nrequired to perfect title, or if discharged on account of wounds\r\nreceived, or disability incurred in the line of duty, then the term of\r\nenlistment shall be deducted from the time heretofore required to perfect\r\ntitle, without reference to the length of time he may have served:\r\n_Provided, however_, that no patent shall issue to any homestead settler\r\nwho has not resided upon, improved and cultivated his said homestead for\r\na period of at least one year after he shall commence his improvements as\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nSECTION 2. That any person entitled under the provisions of the foregoing\r\nsection to enter a homestead, who may have heretofore entered under the\r\nHomestead law a quantity of land less than one hundred and sixty acres,\r\nshall be permitted to enter under the provisions of this act so much land\r\nas, when added to the quantity previously entered, shall not exceed one\r\nhundred and sixty acres.\r\n\r\nSECTION 3. That in the case of the death of any person who would be\r\nentitled to a homestead under the provisions of the first section of this\r\nact, his widow, if unmarried, or in case of her death or marriage, then\r\nhis minor orphan children, by a guardian duly approved and officially\r\naccredited at the Department of the Interior, shall be entitled to all\r\nthe benefits enumerated in this act, subject to all the provisions as\r\nto settlement and improvements therein contained: _Provided_, that if\r\nsuch person died during his term of enlistment, the whole term of his\r\nenlistment shall be deducted from the time heretofore required to perfect\r\nthe title.\r\n\r\nSECTION 4. That where a party, at the date of his entry of a tract of\r\nland under the Homestead laws, or subsequently thereto, was actually\r\nenlisted and employed in the army or navy of the United States, his\r\nservices therein shall, in the administration of said Homestead laws, be\r\nconstrued to be equivalent, to all intents and purposes, to a residence\r\nfor the same length of time upon the tract so entered: _Provided_,\r\nthat if his entry has been canceled by reason of his absence from said\r\ntract while in the military or naval service of the United States, and\r\nsuch tract has not been disposed of, his entry shall be restored and\r\nconfirmed: _And provided further_, that if such tract has been disposed\r\nof, said party may enter another tract subject to the entry under said\r\nlaws, and his right to a patent therefor shall be determined by the\r\nproofs touching his residence and cultivation of the first tract and his\r\nabsence therefrom in such service.\r\n\r\nSECTION 5. That any soldier, sailor, marine, officer, or other person\r\ncoming within the provisions of this act may, as well BY AN AGENT as in\r\nperson, enter upon said homestead: _Provided_, that the said claimant in\r\nperson shall, within the time prescribed [SIX MONTHS FROM DATE OF ENTRY]\r\ncommence settlement and improvement on the same, and thereafter fulfill\r\nall the requirements of this act.\r\n\r\nSECTION 6. That the commissioner of the General Land Office shall have\r\nauthority to make all needful rules and regulations to carry into effect\r\nthe provisions of this act.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nPATENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. These originated in the desire of the founders of the government\r\nto encourage invention, in the belief that the general welfare of the\r\ncountry would be promoted by such a stimulus to genius, and the power to\r\ngrant patents was expressly bestowed on Congress. That this was a very\r\nwise forethought there is no doubt. The hope of reward has given birth\r\nto innumerable inventions, among which some have been of incalculable\r\nvalue to the country, increasing its wealth almost beyond our power to\r\nestimate. It is, however, worth considering if there may not be a limit\r\nto the usefulness of the system, in its present form, in the changed\r\nconditions of the country. It is often the case that what accomplished\r\nthe greatest good in its proper day, is at length outgrown, and becomes\r\nan embarrassment, requiring to be either essentially modified or laid\r\naside.\r\n\r\n2. A patent right is an exclusive right, granted by an officer\r\ndenominated the Commissioner of Patents, in conformity to law, to the\r\ninventor or discoverer of any new and useful article. The exclusive\r\nright is conferred by acts of Congress, on compliance of the inventor\r\nwith certain conditions which are clearly specified in the law. The\r\nevidence that such exclusive right has been conferred on any individual,\r\nis contained in a document, called “letters patent,” issued at the\r\npatent office in Washington; signed by the Secretary of the Interior,\r\n(formerly by the Secretary of State), countersigned by the Commissioner\r\nof Patents, and sealed with the seal of his office. Thus protected, he\r\nalone can make, use and sell the article he has invented, for the term of\r\nfourteen years; and upon showing a good reason therefor, the commissioner\r\nwill extend the term seven years longer, or Congress will pass a special\r\nact for that purpose.\r\n\r\n3. This was the law up to 1861; and is still in force as to patents\r\ngranted anterior to that date. But a new act was then passed, extending\r\nthe term of an original patent to seventeen, instead of fourteen years,\r\nand prohibiting any extension of such patents.\r\n\r\nAn inventor, before he can obtain a patent, must swear that he believes\r\nhe is the inventor or discoverer of the art, machine, or improvement,\r\nfor which he solicits a patent. He must also give in writing a clear,\r\nminute description of it; and, when necessary, must make and deliver\r\na model of his invention; which in all cases must be something new,\r\nunused and unknown before, or his application will be rejected. There is\r\nconsiderable expense attending the procurement of a patent right.\r\n\r\n4. But when obtained, no person except the patentee, has any right to\r\nmake, sell, or use the article patented, until the time has expired for\r\nwhich this exclusive right was granted, without the permission of the\r\npatentee. Any person doing so is liable to a heavy penalty, and may be\r\nprosecuted in the Circuit Court of the United States; this court having\r\noriginal jurisdiction in all cases arising under the patent laws. But a\r\nwrit of error or an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\n5. The Patent Office, when first established, was a bureau of the State\r\nDepartment, and the Commissioner of Patents acted under the direction of\r\nthe Secretary of State. But after the creation of the Department of the\r\nInterior, in 1849, it was transferred to it, became a bureau of the new\r\ndepartment, and the commissioner now acts under the general direction of\r\nits secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS\r\n\r\n6. Is appointed by the President and Senate. His duties are best\r\nexplained in the language of the law itself, which, in speaking of the\r\ncreation and appointment of this official, says that his duties shall be\r\n“to superintend, execute and perform all such acts and things touching\r\nand respecting the granting and issuing of patents for new and useful\r\ndiscoveries, inventions and improvements, as are herein provided for, or\r\nshall hereafter be by law directed to be done and performed.”\r\n\r\nHe has the charge and custody of all books, records, papers, models,\r\nmachines, and all other things belonging to the patent office; and has\r\nthe privilege of sending and receiving letters and packages by mail,\r\nrelating to the business of the office, free of postage. He has the\r\npower to appoint his clerks, examiners and subordinates; among whom are\r\npatent office agents, who may be appointed in not more than twenty of\r\nthe principal cities and towns in the United States. It is their duty to\r\nforward to the patent office all such models, specimens and manufactures,\r\nas shall be intended to be patented.\r\n\r\n7. In cases of appeal from the decision of the commissioner, the appeal\r\nmay be made to the board of examiners, or to the Chief Justice of the\r\nDistrict Court of the United States for the District of Columbia. There\r\nis a seal for the patent office, which the commissioner keeps, and which\r\nhe must affix to patents when granted, and to other papers and records\r\nissued from his office, which are wanted as evidence in other places.\r\n\r\nHe is also authorized to publish a classified and alphabetical list of\r\nall patents issued at the patent office. This he frequently does, for the\r\ninformation of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nPENSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPensions are a provision, made by the general government, for the\r\nofficers and privates of the army and navy disabled in the service of the\r\ncountry. They peril their lives for the protection of the public, and\r\nit has always been regarded as just that a support, proportioned to the\r\nextent of injury received, should be given to them, or to those dependent\r\non them in case of their death. It is properly a continuance of pay in\r\nconsideration of the services rendered. It does not often amount to a\r\nfull support, and is graduated by the amount each received, according to\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMMISSIONER OF PENSIONS\r\n\r\nWas appointed and placed at the head of a bureau, at first in the War\r\nDepartment, but afterward transferred to the care of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior. It is a Pension Office, in fact. This commissioner is appointed\r\nby the President and Senate in the same manner as other important\r\nofficers. It is his duty to carry into effect the pension laws. He is\r\nauthorized to appoint pension agents in all the States and Territories,\r\nwho receive and distribute the money due to pensioners in their several\r\ndistricts, the agents receiving from the government a percentage for\r\ntheir services.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a large number on the list. At first they were\r\nthe disabled soldiers and sailors of the Revolutionary War; then of the\r\nWar of 1812 with England, followed in 1846 by the Mexican War. But all\r\nthese were few compared with the number disabled in the Civil War. The\r\namount appropriated by Congress for the year 1873-4, for pensions was\r\n$30,480,000. The law carefully protects the pensions against frauds and\r\nforbids its attachment by any legal process whatever. The nation is\r\ngrateful to its brave defenders.\r\n\r\nThe proper officials to whom all applications should be made, by letter\r\nor petition, in Washington, are, by a soldier having his discharge, to\r\nthe Paymaster General; when the discharge paper is lost, to the Second\r\nAuditor of the Treasury; when by those who represent a deceased person,\r\nto the second Auditor of the Treasury; when for commutation of rations,\r\nto the same officer; when for pensions, or any matter connected with\r\npensions, to the Commissioner of Pensions.\r\n\r\nInstructions have been prepared for all applicants, by the Commissioner\r\nof Pensions for the purpose of preventing fraud or misunderstanding. They\r\nare, in substance:\r\n\r\n    INSTRUCTIONS.\r\n\r\n    By the act of Congress approved July 14th, 1862, and amendatory\r\n    acts, pensions are granted as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Invalids, disabled in the military or naval service of the\r\n    United States, in the line of duty.\r\n\r\n    2. Widows of persons who have been killed or have died in the\r\n    military or naval service of the United States.\r\n\r\n    3. Children under sixteen, of the classes of persons on account\r\n    of whose death widows are entitled; provided said widows have\r\n    died, or have remarried.\r\n\r\n    4. Mothers of all classes of persons on account of whose death\r\n    widows are entitled, provided said mothers were dependent on\r\n    the deceased for support and no minor child survived.\r\n\r\n    5. Fathers, the same as mothers, in case of the death of the\r\n    latter.\r\n\r\n    6. Brothers and sisters, under sixteen, provided they were\r\n    dependent for support upon the person on account of whose\r\n    decease they claim.\r\n\r\nThe First Section of the Act of July 14th, 1862, showing the rates of\r\npension to the several classes and grades, is as follows:\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America, in Congress assembled_, That if any officer,\r\nnon-commissioned officer, musician, or private of the army, including\r\nregulars, volunteers, militia, or any officer, warrant, or petty\r\nofficer, musician, seaman, ordinary seaman, flotillaman, marine, clerk,\r\nlandsman, pilot, or other person in the navy or marine corps, has\r\nbeen, since the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and sixty-one,\r\nor shall hereafter be, disabled by reason of any wound received or\r\ndisease contracted while in the service of the United States, and in\r\nthe line of duty, he shall, upon making due proof of the fact according\r\nto such forms and regulations as are or may be provided by, or in\r\npursuance of law, be placed upon the list of invalid pensions of the\r\nUnited States, and be entitled to receive, for the highest rate of\r\ndisability, such pension as is hereinafter provided in such cases,\r\nand for an inferior disability an amount proportionate to the highest\r\ndisability, to commence as hereinafter provided, and continue during the\r\nexistence of such disability. The pension for a total disability for\r\nofficers, non-commissioned officers, musicians and privates employed\r\nin the military service of the United States, whether regulars,\r\nvolunteers, or militia, and in the marine corps, shall be as follows,\r\nviz.: lieutenant-colonel and all officers of a higher rank, thirty\r\ndollars per month; major, twenty-five dollars per month; captain, twenty\r\ndollars per month; first lieutenant, seventeen dollars per month; second\r\nlieutenant, fifteen dollars per month; and non-commissioned officers,\r\nmusicians and privates, eight dollars per month. The pension for total\r\ndisability for officers, warrant or petty officers, and others employed\r\nin the naval service of the United States, shall be as follows, viz.:\r\ncaptain, commander, surgeon, paymaster, and chief engineer, respectively,\r\nranking with commander by law, lieutenant commanding, and master\r\ncommanding, thirty dollars per month; lieutenant, surgeon, paymaster,\r\nand chief engineer, respectively, ranking with lieutenant by law, and\r\npassed assistant surgeon, twenty-five dollars per month; professor\r\nof mathematics, master, assistant surgeon, assistant paymaster, and\r\nchaplain, twenty dollars per month; first assistant engineer and pilots,\r\nfifteen dollars per month; passed midshipman, midshipman, captain’s, and\r\npaymaster’s clerk, second and third assistant engineers, master’s mate,\r\nand all warrant officers, ten dollars per month; all petty officers,\r\nand all other persons before named employed in the naval service, eight\r\ndollars per month; and all commissioned officers, of either service,\r\nshall receive such and only such pension as is herein provided for the\r\nrank in which they hold commissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT OF JULY 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nVarious supplementary Acts have been passed by the Act of July 14, 1862,\r\nmodifying in some particulars the provisions of previous legislation.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of July 4, 1864, it is provided that biennial examinations\r\nwill hereafter be made by one surgeon only, if he is regularly appointed,\r\nor holds a surgeon’s commission in the army. Examinations by unappointed\r\ncivil surgeons will not be accepted, unless it can be shown that an\r\nexamination by a commissioned or duly appointed surgeon is impracticable.\r\n\r\n_Increased Pensions in Certain Cases._—A pension of twenty-five dollars\r\nper month is granted to those having lost both hands or both eyes in\r\nthe military service of the United States, in the line of duty, and\r\ntwenty dollars per month to those who, under the same conditions, shall\r\nhave lost both feet, if such parties were entitled to a lower rate of\r\npension under the act of 1862. This higher pension will date only from\r\nthe 4th day of July, 1864, in case of pensioners already enrolled, or of\r\napplicants discharged prior to that date.\r\n\r\n_Evidence of Muster-in._—In accordance with the 11th Section of the\r\nAct of July 4, 1864, evidence of the muster-in of the soldier will not\r\nbe required in any case, but there must be positive record evidence of\r\nservice. Evidence of muster-in in the case of commissioned officers is\r\nstill required.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT OF JUNE 6, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe Supplementary Pension Act, approved June six, eighteen hundred and\r\nsixty-six, provides increased rates of pensions over those granted by the\r\nAct of July fourteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, in the following\r\ncases, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Twenty-five dollars per month to all those invalids entitled, under\r\nthe Act of July fourteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, to a lower rate\r\nof pension, on account of service rendered since March four, eighteen\r\nhundred and sixty-one, “who shall have lost the sight of both eyes, or\r\nwho shall have lost both hands, or been permanently and totally disabled\r\nin the same, or otherwise so permanently and totally disabled as to\r\nrender them utterly helpless, or so nearly so as to require the constant\r\npersonal aid and attendance of another person.”\r\n\r\n2. Twenty dollars per month to those invalids who, being entitled under\r\nlike conditions to a lower rate of pension, “shall have lost both feet,\r\nor one hand and one foot, or been totally and permanently disabled in the\r\nsame, or otherwise so disabled as to be incapacitated for performing any\r\nmanual labor, but not so much so as to require constant personal aid and\r\nattention.”\r\n\r\n3. Fifteen dollars per month to those invalids who, under like\r\nconditions, “shall have lost one hand or one foot, or been totally and\r\npermanently disabled in the same, or otherwise so disabled as to render\r\ntheir inability to perform manual labor equivalent to the loss of a hand\r\nor a foot.”\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the benefits of the foregoing provisions, pensioners\r\nalready enrolled will file an application in accordance with form F,\r\nappended hereto. Proof in addition to that on file with the previous\r\napplication need not be forwarded, except as shall be specially required\r\nin each case, after the application is received. The applicant need\r\nonly be examined by a pension surgeon when expressly required, on due\r\nnotice from this office. Applicants not already pensioned, who believe\r\nthemselves entitled to the benefit of the foregoing provisions, will\r\nspecifically set forth such claim in their declarations, carefully\r\nstating the nature of the disability on account of which such higher\r\nrate of pension is claimed. The declaration must be made before some\r\nofficer of a court of record, or before a pension notary designated by\r\nthis office, as provided by the third section of the act of July four,\r\neighteen hundred and sixty-four.\r\n\r\nThe above specified increased rates of pension will be allowed only\r\nto those disabled since the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and\r\nsixty-one, and will date only from the sixth day of June, eighteen\r\nhundred and sixty-six.\r\n\r\n_Teamsters, Artificers, and other Enlisted Men_,—not embraced in the\r\nterms of the Act of July fourteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, or of\r\nActs supplementary thereto, are, by the tenth section of the Act of June\r\nsix, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, included in the administration of\r\nthe pension laws, in the class of non-commissioned officers and privates.\r\n\r\n_Minor Children to be Pensioned, in Certain Cases, instead of the\r\nWidow._—The eleventh section provides that when any widow, entitled to\r\na pension under previous Acts, has abandoned the care of a child or\r\nchildren of her deceased husband, under sixteen years of age, “or is an\r\nunsuitable person, by reason of immoral conduct, to have the custody of\r\nthe same,” the pension shall be paid to the duly authorized guardian of\r\nsuch child or children, while under the age of sixteen years, and not to\r\nthe widow. The proper proof in such case, as provided by this section, is\r\nthe certificate of the judge of any court having probate jurisdiction,\r\n“that satisfactory evidence has been produced before such court” to the\r\neffect above indicated. In presenting an application under this section,\r\nthe guardians of the minor child or children will make a declaration in\r\naccordance with the appended form G.\r\n\r\n_Pensions Granted to Dependent Fathers and to Dependent Orphan\r\nBrothers._—By the twelfth section the provisions of the Act of July\r\nfourteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, are extended so as to include\r\nthe dependent brother or brothers of a deceased officer, soldier or\r\nseaman, and the dependent father of such deceased persons, under like\r\nlimitations as apply in the case of dependent sisters and mothers; but\r\nnot more than one pension is granted on account of the same person, or\r\nto more than one of said classes. The forms prescribed for the latter\r\ncases may be used, with obvious variations, in applications made by\r\ndependent fathers or on behalf of dependent brothers.\r\n\r\n_Limitations as to Number and Date of Pensions._—The thirteenth section\r\ndeclares that but one pension shall be granted to any person at the same\r\ntime; and that when application is not made within three years after the\r\ndeath or discharge of the party on whose account a pension is claimed,\r\nsuch pension, if allowed, “shall commence from the date of filing\r\nthe last paper in said case by the party prosecuting the same.” This\r\nlimitation applies to all classes of pensions.\r\n\r\n_Evidence of Marriage of Colored Applicants._—The fourteenth section\r\nprovides that habitual recognition of the marriage relation between\r\ncolored parties—that is, in the absence of the usually required\r\nproof—when shown by “proof satisfactory to the Commissioner of Pensions,”\r\nshall be accepted as evidence of marriage, and the children of such\r\nparties shall be regarded as if born in lawful wedlock. When the usual\r\nproof of marriage can be furnished, it will be required as heretofore.\r\nWhen only evidence of cohabitation and mutual recognition can be\r\nadduced, as provided in this section, the testimony of two credible and\r\ndisinterested witnesses will be required, who must state how long they\r\nhave been personally acquainted with the parties, and for how long a\r\nperiod the latter are known to have recognized each other as man and\r\nwife. If such acquaintance is deemed to be of too recent date to warrant\r\nthe acceptance of this testimony, or if there is reason to doubt, in\r\nany instance, that the marriage relation existed in good faith, more\r\nspecific instructions will be issued, adapted to the circumstances of the\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT OF JULY 25, 1866.\r\n\r\n_Provost Marshals, Enrolling Officers, and others Entitled to the\r\nBenefits of the Pension Laws._—The first section of the Act of July\r\ntwenty-five, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, extends the benefits\r\nconferred by the pension laws to provost marshals, deputy provost\r\nmarshals, and enrolling officers disabled in the line of their official\r\nduty as such, and to the widows or dependents of such officers in like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nDeclarations will be made in accordance with the instructions issued\r\nunder the Pension Act of July fourteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-two,\r\nand supplementary Acts. The grade of such officers, for the purpose\r\nof determining the rates of pensions under this section, is fixed as\r\nfollows: Provost marshals will rank as captains; their deputies as first\r\nlieutenants; and enrolling officers as second lieutenants.\r\n\r\n_Increased Pensions to Widows, and Orphan Children Under Sixteen Years\r\nof Age._—The second section of this act allows to those who are or shall\r\nbe pensioned as widows of soldiers or sailors, two dollars per month\r\nadditional pension for each child (under sixteen years of age) of the\r\ndeceased soldier or sailor by the widow thus pensioned.\r\n\r\nOn the death or remarriage of such widow, or on the denial of a pension\r\nto her, in accordance with the provisions of section eleven of the Act\r\nof June six, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, the same amount to which\r\nshe would otherwise be entitled, under this and previous provisions, is\r\nallowed to the minor children. The number and names of the children,\r\nwith their ages, must be proved by the affidavits of two credible and\r\ndisinterested witnesses. The provisions of this section only include\r\nthe children of the widow, and not those of her deceased husband by a\r\nprevious marriage. The widows of minor children of officers are not\r\nentitled to this increase. Declarations for an increase under this\r\nsection, if for the widow, will be made in accordance with form H,\r\nappended hereto; and if for minor children, according to form I. The\r\npension certificate must be sent with all applications filed subsequently\r\nto September four, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.\r\n\r\n_Increase of Pensions under Acts prior to July 4, 1862._—All pensioners\r\nunder Acts approved prior to July fourteen, eighteen hundred and\r\nsixty-two, are, by the third section of the present act, granted the same\r\nrights as those pensioned under acts approved at or since that date, so\r\nfar as said Acts may be applicable, with the exception of soldiers of the\r\nRevolution or their widows. This section applies only to pensioners who\r\nwere such at the date of the approval of this Act.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of claimants under this section will be made in accordance\r\nwith the forms previously issued under Act of July fourteen, eighteen\r\nhundred and sixty-two, and subsequent pension acts, with the necessary\r\nmodifications, and the pension certificates will be returned.\r\n\r\n_Invalid Pensions of Claimants Dying while their Applications are\r\nPending, the Evidence being Completed._—The fourth section of this act is\r\nconstrued in connection with the tenth section of the Act of July four,\r\neighteen hundred and sixty-four, and the sixth section of the Act of\r\nJune six, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, to which it is supplementary.\r\nIf an applicant for invalid pension dies while his claim is pending, the\r\nevidence having been completed, the pension, under the provisions of this\r\nsection and of those sections of previous acts above referred to, is\r\ndisposed of as follows:\r\n\r\n1. If he left a widow, or minor child, or children under sixteen years\r\nof age, or other dependent relatives, and died of wounds received or of\r\ndisease contracted in the service or in the line of duty, no invalid\r\npension certificate will issue, but such widow or dependent relatives\r\nwill receive a pension, in their own right, taking precedence in the\r\norder prescribed by law in other cases.\r\n\r\n2. If the claimant left a widow or dependent relatives, but did not die\r\nof wounds received, or disease contracted in the service and in the line\r\nof duty, so that neither widow nor dependent relatives would be entitled\r\nto a pension on his account, then the certificate will be issued in his\r\nname, and the pension paid to the widow or to the dependent relatives,\r\nas the case may be, in the same order in which they would have been\r\npensioned, if entitled, as set forth in the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\n3. If the claimant left no widow or dependent relatives, the certificate\r\nwill issue in his name, and the pension will be drawn by his executor or\r\nadministrator.\r\n\r\n_Certain Accrued Rights Reserved under Repealed Enactments._—The fifth\r\nsection reserves all rights that may have accrued under the fifth section\r\nof the pension Act of July four, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and the\r\nthird section of the pension Act of March three, eighteen hundred and\r\nsixty-five, though repealed by the first section of the Act of June six,\r\neighteen hundred sixty-six.\r\n\r\n_Widows Remarrying while their Claims are Pending_,—Are entitled, under\r\nthe sixth section, if their claims are otherwise valid, to receive\r\npensions to the date of remarriage, if the deceased officer, soldier\r\nor sailor, on whose account they claim, left no legitimate child under\r\nsixteen years of age.\r\n\r\n                                                   JOSEPH H. BARRETT,\r\n                                              _Commissioner of Pensions_.\r\n\r\n  PENSION OFFICE, August 4, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT OF JULY 27, 1868.\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.—_Dependent Relatives._—In this section precedence is given to\r\nthe dependent relatives hereinafter mentioned, in the following order,\r\nto wit: First, mothers; secondly, fathers; thirdly, orphan brothers and\r\nsisters under sixteen, who shall be pensioned jointly; and the persons\r\nenumerated shall each be entitled in their order, after the death of the\r\none preceding.\r\n\r\nSECT. 2.—_Invalids Disabled Subsequent to Passage of this Act._—This\r\nsection specifies as to pensions by reason of disabilities incurred\r\nsubsequent to the passage of this Act, and enumerates the circumstances\r\nunder which said disabilities must have been contracted.\r\n\r\nSECT. 3.—_Unclaimed Pensions._—This section provides that pensions\r\nremaining unclaimed for fourteen months after the same have become due,\r\nshall be adjusted at the Pension Agency instead of at the office of the\r\nThird Auditor; and the failure of any pensioner to claim his or her\r\npension for _three_ years, shall be deemed presumptive evidence that\r\nthe same has legally terminated. On a new application, with evidence\r\nsatisfactorily accounting for such failure, the pensioner may be restored\r\nto the rolls.\r\n\r\nSECT. 4.—_Increase of Pensions of Widows and of Children by a former\r\nWife._—This section gives an increase of two dollars per month for each\r\nminor child of a deceased soldier, to commence from the death of their\r\nfather, and continue until they severally attain the age of sixteen\r\nyears; and provides that the children of a former marriage shall be\r\n“entitled to receive two dollars per month, to commence from the death\r\nof their father, and continue until they severally attain the age of\r\nsixteen years, to be paid to the guardian of such child or children for\r\ntheir use and benefit; _Provided, however_, That in all such cases such\r\nwidow is charged with the care, custody, and maintenance of such child\r\nor children, the said sum of two dollars per month for each of said\r\nchildren shall be paid to her for and during the time she is or may have\r\nbeen so charged with the care, custody, and maintenance of such child or\r\nchildren, subject to the same conditions, provisions and limitations as\r\nif they were her own children by her said deceased husband.”\r\n\r\nSECT. 5.—_Widows and Minors not Debarred, etc._—By this section no widow\r\nor guardian to whom an increase of pension has been or may hereafter be\r\ngranted on account of minor children, shall be deprived thereof by reason\r\nof their being maintained or educated at the expense of the State or of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nSECT. 6.—_Extension of Limitation._—This section provides that all\r\npensions applied for within five years after the right thereto shall\r\nhave accrued, and which have been or may be granted under the Act of\r\nJuly 14, 1862, or Acts supplementary thereto, shall commence from the\r\ndischarge or death of the person on whose account the pension has been\r\nor shall be granted; and in cases of insane persons and minors, who were\r\nwithout guardians or other proper legal representatives previous to\r\nsaid limitation, applications may be filed in their behalf after its\r\nexpiration. This section applies solely to cases in which the title to\r\npension has accrued subsequent to March 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nSECT. 7.—_Arrears._—In which notification of title to arrears of pension,\r\nunder the foregoing section is provided for; and also that no claim agent\r\nor other person shall be entitled to compensation for services in making\r\napplication for such arrears.\r\n\r\nSECT. 8.—_Widow’s Pension to Children, etc._—In which the requirement\r\nof the certificate of the court that satisfactory evidence has been\r\nadduced of the abandonment of the care of the minor child or children of\r\na deceased soldier by his widow, or of her unsuitableness to have custody\r\nof them is dispensed with. The furnishing of satisfactory evidence\r\nthereof to the commissioner shall be sufficient to cause the suspension\r\nof said widow’s pension.\r\n\r\nSECT. 9.—_Pending Claim may be Completed by Heirs._—In which if any\r\nperson entitled to a pension has died since March 4, 1861, his heirs or\r\nlegal representatives shall be entitled to receive the accrued pension;\r\nprovided no widow or minor child survives the applicant.\r\n\r\nSECT. 10.—_Remarriage._—This section provides for pension to the widow\r\nor dependent mother, from the death of soldier to the date of claimant’s\r\nremarriage, (provided no children under sixteen survive.)\r\n\r\nSECT. 11.—_Extension of Time._—This section provides for the continuance\r\nin force of the Act of July 4, 1864, from the 4th July, 1867, for five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSECT. 12.—_Loss of an Eye._—This section allows twenty-five dollars\r\nas a pension for total loss of sight from wounds received or disease\r\ncontracted in the service, though the pensioner may have had only one eye\r\nwhen entering the service.\r\n\r\nSECT. 13.—_Pension by reason of Right Accrued since Revolution._—By this\r\nsection all persons pensioned by reason of services rendered since the\r\nwar of the Revolution, and prior to March 4, 1861, are placed on the same\r\nfooting with those pensioned under Acts passed since that time; and\r\ngrants eight dollars per month to the widows of revolutionary soldiers\r\nand sailors now pensioned at less than that amount.\r\n\r\nSECT. 14.—_Limbs to Officers._—By this section captains in the army and\r\nlieutenants in the navy, and those of less rank, who have lost a leg or\r\nan arm in such service, shall be entitled to receive an artificial limb\r\nupon the same terms as privates in the army.\r\n\r\nSECT. 15.—_Special Acts._—By this section all pensions granted by special\r\nActs shall be subject to be varied in amount, according to the provisions\r\nand limitations of the pension laws.\r\n\r\nSECT. 16.—_Repealing Clause._—By this section all Acts and parts of Acts\r\ninconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this Act be and the same\r\nare hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nINDIAN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen America was discovered, in 1492, the whole continent was thinly\r\npopulated (except in some few regions where a considerable degree of\r\ncivilization and skill in agriculture had been attained, as in Mexico and\r\nPeru) by roving tribes of natives, of unknown origin. These were called,\r\nby Europeans, Indians, from the erroneous idea of Columbus, and the men\r\nof that age at first, that there was only one continent; and that they\r\nhad reached the eastern shore of Asia, when America was discovered.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the region comprising our country was in the possession of\r\na great number of these tribes. Their number, when permanent settlements\r\nbegan to be made, is not known, but probably amounted, in all the vast\r\nterritory, to only a few million—perhaps two or three. They divided\r\nthe country between them, in an indefinite way, war and hunting being\r\ntheir chief occupations. They attempted very little cultivation of the\r\nsoil. The settlements of the Indians were as indefinite and moveable as\r\ntheir boundaries, and they attached little value to land. Territory was\r\nacquired from them partly by force and partly by purchase. These last\r\nwere usually made for a nominal sum, and with little comprehension, on\r\ntheir part, of the importance and future effects of its alienation.\r\n\r\nAs the settlements of Europeans extended, frequent and barbarous wars,\r\ngreatly exasperating the whites, arose as a revenge for private injuries,\r\nor in retaliation of encroachments on their hunting grounds. As these\r\nalways ended, ultimately, in favor of the settlers, and the Indians were\r\ndriven farther back, the country was taken possession of as the spoils of\r\nconquest. These desolating contests, and the easily-acquired vices of the\r\nwhites constantly diminished their numbers. They were so inherently wild\r\nmen that the conquered remnants usually withered and faded away under the\r\nprocess of civilization.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the War of the Revolution, the settlements came to be\r\nconsolidated and extensive, under the rapid growth of the population,\r\nlands were reserved for these remnants; treaties were made with them, as\r\nwith independent nations; and, from their improvidence and carelessness\r\nas to the economical preservation of their resources, the indemnities\r\nallowed them for the lands to which they renounced all claim were paid to\r\nthem in installments, or as annuities, by the government. This system has\r\nbeen continued to the present day, and has occasioned the establishment\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN BUREAU OF THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nIt is presided over by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, appointed in\r\nthe usual way by the President and Senate. Numerous Superintendents and\r\nagents are appointed to reside near the different locations assigned to\r\nthe Indians, to conduct the business under his supervision, and receive\r\nand distribute the goods and moneys given by treaty to each tribe. They\r\ngive bonds for faithfulness in the employment of funds destined for the\r\nIndians. They are appointed for four years, and report and account to the\r\nDepartment of the Interior.\r\n\r\nExcept a few who are taxed, the Indians are not counted among our\r\npopulation as citizens. They have, therefore, no representative in\r\nCongress, nor, except the criminal law to some extent, are they amenable\r\nto other of our laws than such as the treaties have established.\r\nTheir internal government is conducted by themselves alone, neither\r\ngovernor, judge, nor courts being established, as in other Territorial\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\nThey are difficult to control, however, not recognizing, as civilized\r\npeople do (except a small number who are far on the way to civilization),\r\nthe obligations of treaties and pledges. Dishonest and self-seeking\r\nmen often take advantage of their ignorance and their love of ardent\r\nspirits and trinkets, to cheat and injure them. To remedy this as far as\r\npossible, white men are not permitted to reside on their reservations\r\nunless by special license of the government. Nor can they alienate their\r\nlands to white men not officials acting under government supervision.\r\n\r\nAll pains are required to be taken by the government officers to promote\r\ntheir interests, and schools and missions are encouraged among them, and\r\nagricultural implements are furnished so far as they can be persuaded\r\nto use them. In short, it is the benevolent and enlightened aim of\r\nthe government to act as the guardians of their true interests, to\r\nencourage mental and moral culture among them, and assist them toward the\r\nacquisition of the arts and comforts of civilized life.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be comprehended that many difficulties oppose themselves\r\nto this effort with a race whose instincts are so wild and fierce, and\r\nwho adopt our vices so much more readily than our virtues, and are so\r\neasily influenced by bad and designing men. Still, progress is made, as\r\nwill be seen in the case of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nIt is situated south of the 37th degree of north latitude, and west of\r\nthe States of Arkansas and Missouri. Texas bounds it on the south. It\r\nhas 71,127 square miles, and is about a third larger than the State of\r\nIllinois. It is very fertile, for the most part, and a beautiful region.\r\nIt is inhabited, in great part, by Indians who have been transferred from\r\nthe regions east of the Mississippi, mostly Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws,\r\nand Seminoles. Some of these were removed by persuasion, and some by\r\nforce, from their former homes, where they were disturbed by proximity to\r\nthe rapidly increasing white population.\r\n\r\nEach tribe has its own section of the Territory. Here they practice their\r\nown customs unmolested, and conduct their own government. Many of them,\r\nespecially the Cherokees, are intelligent and industrious. They have\r\nchurches and schools and factories, highly-cultivated farms and good\r\nbuildings. Improvement is so marked among them that it is not improbable\r\nthat they may at some future time become a State in our Union. At present\r\nthey are amenable to the Circuit and District Courts of the adjoining\r\nStates when certain crimes are committed by them against the whites in\r\nthose States, but our courts have no authority over their relations to\r\none another.\r\n\r\nThe population of the Territory is 70,000. The entire Indian population\r\nof the country is over 300,000. They are scattered over the States and\r\nTerritories between the Missouri river and the Pacific coast, and those\r\noutside the Indian Territory are often at war with each other and with\r\nour citizens, requiring many troops and a large expense to keep them\r\nin subjection. It is probable that, as a race, they will soon become\r\nextinct, except, perhaps, those in the Indian Territory. They are uneasy,\r\nand dangerous neighbors to the whites in those sparsely-settled regions.\r\nThe amount appropriated to the Indians by Congress for the year 1873-4,\r\nwas $5,513,937, which was exclusive of their annuities, or funds invested\r\nfor them, of which they receive the annual interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nCENSUS BUREAU.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A census is an enumeration, or counting, of the inhabitants of\r\nany country. History informs us that this was done in very ancient\r\ntimes. One of the books in the Old Testament (Numbers) was named from\r\nthe circumstance that it contains an account of the numbering of the\r\nIsraelites, by the order of Moses. That numbering was a _census_ of the\r\npeople composing the Jewish nation. It not only gives us the total number\r\nof the people, but that of each tribe; much after our own mode of doing\r\nthe same thing. We take ours by States, and we find the total of the\r\nwhole nation. In ancient times a census seems to have been taken more\r\nfor military than for any other purpose. This is one of the objects in\r\nthe present day; but in modern times many uses are made of a census. It\r\nnot only shows the military power of a nation, but when taken with the\r\ndistinction of sex, and age, with an account of the births, marriages,\r\nand deaths during each year, it throws much light upon a variety of\r\ninteresting topics; such as the longevity, the rate of mortality, the\r\nratio of increase, and the average duration of human life. These, and\r\nmany other important facts are obtained by a census.\r\n\r\n2. In the United States the census is the only means by which Congress\r\ndetermines the number of Representatives each State is entitled to\r\nhave in that body. Hence the Constitution itself makes provision for\r\nthe enumeration of the people once in ten years—called a decade. The\r\nfirst was made in 1790, the next in 1800, and so on every tenth year.\r\nIf the number of any year ends with a cipher, we know that the United\r\nStates census was taken, or will be taken, in that year, whether we look\r\nbackward or forward.\r\n\r\n3. Up to the present time, according to the provisions made in the\r\nConstitution, a census has been taken nine times, and under the head\r\nof recapitulation (see index) we find what it was each time. We also\r\nfind that from the first (1790), to the last (1870), the population had\r\nincreased from 3,929,827, to 38,838,180. Therefore it approximates very\r\nnearly to 40,000,000; indicating a growth unparalleled by any nation in\r\nancient or modern times.\r\n\r\nWe will next state how this great national work is performed. The\r\nConstitution simply declares that it shall be done, but the laws specify\r\n_how_ it shall be done, and _who_ shall do it.\r\n\r\nThe United States Marshals are the officers designated by the law as the\r\npersons who shall make the enumeration of the people in each State and\r\nTerritory; in addition to which they are also required to procure other\r\nstatistical matter, as directed by Congress.\r\n\r\n4. In order to accomplish this work, it is necessary to employ a number\r\nof assistant marshals, one of whom must visit every house in his\r\ndistrict, and ascertain the number of persons belonging to it, together\r\nwith such statistical information as is required. This is all returned\r\nto the Marshal, and by him sent to the Department of the Interior at\r\nWashington, where, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nit is made into a report, and then laid before Congress, to be used by\r\nit in apportioning to the States their quota of Representatives. This\r\napportionment is actually made in the Department of the Interior, and\r\nthen laid before Congress for its examination and approval. The Marshal\r\nappoints and commissions his deputies, who must be sworn to perform the\r\nduties assigned to them, to the best of their ability.\r\n\r\n5. In the department of the Interior there is a board whose duty it is\r\nto superintend the work of taking the census. It prepares, prints, and\r\nsends to every Marshal the blanks to be used by him and his assistants;\r\nand when they have made returns of their work, the board arranges\r\nthem preparatory to laying them before Congress. After this they are\r\npublished, and make a valuable work of reference; for they contain a\r\nvast amount of statistical information—such as the number of acres of\r\nland under cultivation, the number of bushels of grain of every kind\r\nproduced in the year; the number of horses, cattle, sheep, swine, &c.,\r\nraised; the number of manufacturing establishments, and the amount of\r\ntheir productions; the number of churches, schools, colleges, &c.; the\r\nnumber of deaf, blind, idiotic, and insane persons; together with much\r\nother matter, quite too voluminous for insertion here.\r\n\r\n6. All this is done by order of Congress, and of course paid for from the\r\nUnited States Treasury.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in this book (see index) we give a tabular statement of the\r\npopulation of each State and Territory, at each time the census has been\r\ntaken by the United States. It shows the increase at each decade from\r\n1790, the first time it was taken, to 1870—the last at this date. This\r\ntable also shows the increase in the number of States, from the original\r\n13 to the present 37, besides the Territories, which alone are larger\r\nthan the original 13 States, and nearly as numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas established by an act of Congress, May, 1862. It is not, like\r\nthe other Departments of the Executive Branch of the government,\r\nsuperintended by a Secretary with a seat in the President’s Cabinet. Its\r\nHead is called The Commissioner of Agriculture, and he is appointed by\r\nthe President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, like\r\nother civil officers. The creation of this office is a recognition of\r\nthe extreme importance of this industry to the prosperity and welfare\r\nof the nation. Our country is eminently an agricultural one; and the\r\ninterests confided to this department are those of a class of the people\r\nmore numerous than any other, and on the success of whose labors depends\r\nthe well being of all. In proportion as this industry attains a high\r\nstate of development, and is generally prosperous, do the professional,\r\nmercantile, and manufacturing classes increase in wealth. It is the\r\nfoundation on which they build.\r\n\r\nThe great fertility of our country, and the breadth of area adapted to\r\nall the most useful products of the world, and the need of instruction,\r\nsuggestion, and aid in properly adapting agricultural products to the\r\nsoil and climate, by the large number of settlers in regions with whose\r\npeculiarities they are but partially familiar, give a special interest\r\nand value to this new Department.\r\n\r\nIts duty is to watch over this large field and make such suggestions\r\nto Congress in regard to legislation as shall seem called for; to\r\ndisseminate such practical information among the people as it may be\r\nable to acquire by intelligent observation in this and other countries;\r\nand the testing and dissemination of rare and untried plants of other\r\ncountries that promise to increase our agricultural resources.\r\n\r\nFor experiments in the latter case, a propagating garden and grounds\r\nare provided, and the most skillful and intelligent officers, bringing\r\nall the lights of science to their assistance, devote themselves to the\r\nstudy of these plants, as to the soil and climate best adapted to them,\r\nthe proper modes of cultivation, and to acclimating them to our country.\r\nThis branch of the department sends, to suitable sections of the country,\r\nsuch plants and seeds as it has reason to believe it will be profitable\r\nto introduce and cultivate. This usage, continued for many years, will,\r\nno doubt, contribute very greatly to the variety of useful products which\r\nadd to our comfort and wealth.\r\n\r\nThe department keeps skillful chemists and naturalists constantly\r\nemployed to gather information of various kinds, that may be useful to\r\nagriculturists. The character of soils, the influences of climate, the\r\nbest system of farming, the diseases of domestic animals, and plants\r\nand their cure, the best mode of preserving crops from the ravages of\r\ninsects, and many others are the subjects of careful investigation, and\r\nthe information thus gained is freely communicated to the country at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nThere is a statistical division, in which facts are gathered from the\r\nwhole country and published monthly. This serves many useful purposes.\r\nIt also collects data, for purposes of comparison and instruction, from\r\nforeign countries. Whatever facts it may be most useful for farmers to\r\nknow, whatever crops it may be most profitable for them to produce, and\r\nwhatever improvements in the modes of agriculture and in agricultural\r\nimplements are discovered to be possible are communicated to all without\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nAgricultural education receives much attention from the department, and\r\nall the facts and influences that can aid in making farmers thoroughly\r\nintelligent in their own pursuit, are gathered and employed with effect.\r\nAgriculture cannot but improve immeasureably under this fostering care,\r\nand this Department is likely to become one of the most important and\r\nuseful in the government. It is yet in its infancy, but has already\r\naccomplished much good.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner reports annually to Congress. He has power to appoint\r\nsuch officers as Congress considers necessary. In 1868 a fine building\r\nfor this department was completed at a cost of $140,000. It contains\r\na chemical laboratory with all the necessary apparatus and materials,\r\nand a museum, or collection of specimens, of value in the study of\r\nagriculture, store-rooms for seeds to be sent throughout the country, &c.\r\nThe beauty of the building and grounds adds a very attractive feature to\r\nthe National Capital, and the Institution itself is a favorable comment\r\non the wise and provident care bestowed by the government on the leading\r\ninterest of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nPOST OFFICE DEPARTMENT AND POST MASTER GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis department of the government, whose head, the Post Master General,\r\nis a member of the Cabinet, exists by virtue of Section 8, Article 1st of\r\nthe Constitution, where are these words: “Congress shall have the power\r\nto establish post offices and post roads.”\r\n\r\nFrom small beginnings, in early colonial times, and continued through\r\nthe Revolutionary War, it has grown to be one of the largest and most\r\nimportant departments of the government. The security, speed, and\r\ncheapness of intercourse between all parts of the country and with\r\nforeign lands, is of the utmost importance to business and commerce; it\r\nencourages social intercourse and intimate relations among the people,\r\nand is of no small consequence in developing their intelligence and\r\npromoting their improvement.\r\n\r\nBy successive laws of Congress it has been perfected to its present\r\nstate of excellence. The duties connected with it are performed by many\r\nthousands of persons in every part of the country. They are of average\r\nintelligence and education, and must be trained to their work almost\r\nwithout personal instruction or supervision, yet so complete is the\r\norganization, and so pervading the influence of the central power, the\r\nregulations so simple, clear, and precise, that mistakes are extremely\r\nrare, considering the great number of transactions, and instances of\r\nmisconduct in office are probably less frequent than in any other branch\r\nof the public service, though employing persons well trained and under\r\nclose surveillance.\r\n\r\nThe Post Master General is appointed by the President and the Senate for\r\nfour years. His office is in the General Post Office at Washington. He\r\nhas three assistants, appointed in the same manner as himself. He has\r\na seal of his office, an impression from which must be affixed to the\r\ncommission of every postmaster in the United States; and also to all\r\ncopies of papers and documents that may be wanted from his office. This\r\nonly can give them official value of the same importance as the original\r\npapers. He must give bonds as security for faithfulness in office, and\r\ntake the usual official oath.\r\n\r\nHe has the entire direction and management of the Department, and the\r\nappointment of all local postmasters (in law considered as his deputies),\r\nwhose salary is less than $1,000 per annum. All others are appointed by\r\nthe President and Senate.\r\n\r\nThat its business may be more conveniently arranged and prepared for\r\nhis final action, it is distributed among several bureaus, or minor\r\ndepartments as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPOINTMENT OFFICE.\r\n\r\nIncludes the divisions of appointments; bonds given by postmasters,\r\nagents, and clerks; salaries and allowances, where they are not provided\r\nfor by law; free delivery in cities; and the agency of blanks used in\r\nthe extensive business and reports of the department. This office is in\r\ncharge of the First Assistant Post Master General.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTRACT OFFICE.\r\n\r\nThis includes the divisions of contracts for carrying the mails, by\r\npersons or companies; the inspection of the entire process of carrying\r\nthe mails, to secure their safe, regular, and prompt delivery; mail\r\nequipment, or the supply of all the material and conveniences for\r\ntransportation of the mail, furnished by the department; special agents,\r\nand mail depredations, which has the care of all violations of law and\r\nthe conduct and accounts of all agents employed for the suppression and\r\nprevention of abuses; and the Topographical, which has charge of maps and\r\ndiagrams of mail routes, and geographical information, required for the\r\nvarious branches of the service. It is in charge of the Second Assistant\r\nPost Master General.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCE OFFICE.\r\n\r\nThis is separated into the divisions of Finance, which has charge of the\r\nentire cash receipts, transfers, and disbursements of the department;\r\nof postage stamps and stamped envelopes, newspaper wrappers, and postal\r\ncards; registered letters and seals; and the examination of Dead Letters\r\nand their return to the writers. Dead letters are those not taken out of\r\nthe office to which they were sent. After being advertised three weeks in\r\nsome newspaper near the office where they were sent, they are returned\r\nto the General Post Office, where they are examined; and if they contain\r\nmoney or valuable papers they are returned to the writers and an account\r\nof them kept at the General Post Office. The sums, so lost and taken care\r\nof, amount annually to tens of thousands of dollars. The Third Assistant\r\nPost Master General has charge of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONEY ORDER OFFICE.\r\n\r\nThe Money Orders System furnishes very convenient and safe banking\r\nfacilities for the transfer of money in small sums. It diminishes as much\r\nas possible the exposure of money to loss by theft or otherwise, through\r\nthe plan of depositing in one office, and sending a certificate of such\r\ndeposit which is good for the money at another office. Immense sums are\r\nso exchanged and business facilitated without any actual passage of the\r\nmoney from one point to the other. When it is necessary to preserve the\r\nbalances it is done by, and at the risk of, the department.\r\n\r\nNo more than fifty dollars can be sent in one order, nor more than three\r\norders to the same person in one day. The number of these offices is more\r\nthan 1,400.\r\n\r\nThe rates of commission on money orders are,\r\n\r\n  On orders not exceeding $10       5 cents.\r\n  Over $10, and not exceeding $20  10 cents.\r\n    ”  $20,    ”       ”      $30  15 cents.\r\n    ”  $30,    ”       ”      $40  20 cents.\r\n    ”  $40,    ”       ”      $50  25 cents.\r\n\r\nNo fractions of cents allowed in orders.\r\n\r\nWhen a money order has been lost or destroyed, a duplicate can be got, by\r\nthe person who bought the order or by the person it was bought for, by\r\napplying either at the office where the order was bought or at the office\r\nwhere it should be paid. The Money Order Department is in charge of the\r\nSuperintendent of the Money Order System.\r\n\r\nAn international money order system, between the United States and\r\nSwitzerland, went into operation September 1st, 1869, whereby the\r\nexchange of Postal orders between the two countries is effected through\r\nthe agency of two Post Offices termed International Exchange Offices. The\r\nOffice of New York City being set apart for the United States, and that\r\nof Basle, in Switzerland, for that country. The amount drawn for cannot\r\nexceed fifty dollars in one order, three orders only can be obtained by\r\nthe same person in one day. The system works satisfactorily, and will no\r\ndoubt be extended to Great Britain, and perhaps other European Nations at\r\nan early day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICE OF FOREIGN MAILS.\r\n\r\nIt has the care of all foreign postal arrangements and the supervision of\r\nthe ocean mail service.

In former times the registering of a letter was\r\nonly a notice to those handling it that it was valuable, the process\r\nbeing to simply paste a Registered Letter Bill to the letter and place\r\nit among the ordinary letters. If any officer was dishonest and wanted\r\nthe letter, all he had to do was to take it and destroy the bill, and\r\nthe chances of detection were very slight. The fee was small and the\r\nsafety smaller. Under the new system which has been in operation some few\r\nyears, and is copied from England, the safe transmission and delivery of\r\nmoney and valuables is almost certain. Only letters or other mail matter\r\non which letter rates of postage are fully prepaid can be registered.\r\nEach postmaster is furnished with all the proper blanks, including\r\nthe package envelopes and seals. The latter is a large whitish brown\r\nenvelope, longer and broader than an ordinary official size envelope,\r\nand “Registered Letter” printed in large red letters across the face.\r\nThe seal is similar to a postage stamp, only larger, and is placed over\r\nthe lap after the envelope is sealed, and then cancelled. When a letter\r\nis presented for registration at any post office, the postmaster must\r\nrequire that the name and post office address of the writer thereof be\r\nendorsed on its face; he must also see that the postage, as well as the\r\nfee for registering, is fully prepaid by stamps affixed to such letter;\r\nhe will then fill out a receipt, entering thereon the number of the\r\nletter, the date and name of his office, the name and address of the\r\nwriter, and the address of the letter, sign and deliver it to the person\r\npresenting the letter. The postmaster then makes out his “registered\r\nletter bill” and “return registered letter bill” each of which contains\r\na full description of the letter consisting of address and number. The\r\nregistered letter bill is then placed in the package envelope with the\r\nletter. The package is then sealed up and the name of the post office for\r\nwhich it is destined, and the number and stamp of the mailing office are\r\nplainly marked upon the package. It is then ready for delivery to the\r\nroute agent or postal clerk upon whose route it properly belongs, who is\r\nrequired to give a receipt for it, and also to keep a complete record of\r\nit, as are all officers of the Department who handle registered matter\r\nin transit. He must also take a receipt from the officer to whom he next\r\ndelivers the package. The return registered letter bill is sent in an\r\nordinary envelope in the regular mail to the office of final destination,\r\nwhich will, by reason of the fact that no registered letters are sent\r\nin through mails, and only in charge of postal clerks upon day trains,\r\nnearly always reach the office in advance of the registered letter; and\r\nthe postmaster, then knowing that such letter is on the way, is on the\r\nlookout for it, and if it comes in due time signs the receipt and returns\r\nit to the mailing office. All this is done for a fee of only eight cents\r\nin addition to the regular postage.\r\n\r\nIf a registered letter should not reach its destination in a reasonable\r\nlength of time after the receipt of the return bill, the post master\r\nwill notify the post master at the mailing office of the non-receipt of\r\nthe letter. It then becomes the duty of the last mentioned officer to\r\ninform a special agent of the fact, who will make out what is called\r\na “tracer,” which is a complete description of the letter, with blank\r\nspace for each person who handled the original letter to state, from\r\nhis records and receipts, exactly what disposition he made of it and\r\nwhose receipt he holds; he then passes it along to the next. Thus by\r\nthis complete chain of records and receipts, though it may reach from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific, a registered letter may be readily traced\r\nto its final destination, or until the records cease. If a break should\r\noccur in the chain and the loss be fastened upon any post office or mail\r\nagent, the case is rigidly “investigated” by the proper officer, and if\r\nit appears that the loss occurs through carelessness, the loser is made\r\nto pay the value of the lost letter, and receive a severe reprimand, and\r\nif it should occur again is very apt to be dismissed the service. If the\r\nspecial detective is convinced that the missing letter is stolen, he then\r\ntakes a different course and commences his system of “decoys,” etc., to\r\ncatch the thief, and is almost always successful, as the man who robs the\r\nmails always becomes careless, and grows bolder with each repetition of\r\nthe offense.\r\n\r\nThe amount and extent of the registered letter business may be judged\r\nwhen it is stated that during the month of January, 1874, at the post\r\noffice in New York over sixty thousand registered letters were received,\r\nnearly thirty thousand of which were for delivery in the city, and the\r\nrest for other places, New York being a distributing office.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD LETTERS.\r\n\r\nAbout all that people know or understand of the workings of the Dead\r\nLetter bureau of the Post Office Department is that if a letter is not\r\ndelivered in due time it is sent to the Dead Letter Office, and there\r\nopened and returned to the writer. When, each year, they see the report\r\nof the Postmaster General, the amount of money and number of letters that\r\nare returned to the senders seems enormous, but when it is considered\r\nthat millions of letters and thousands of dollars are carried and safely\r\ndelivered correctly each year in the United States, the number that\r\nfails of delivery, by contrast, does not seem so great. During the month\r\nof November, 1873, nearly ten millions of letters were received and\r\ndispatched in New York City.\r\n\r\nEvery effort is always made to return money or any articles of value\r\nwhich may be found in dead letters. It is required that everything\r\nvaluable shall be registered free when returned to the owners; but if for\r\nany reason it cannot be delivered to the rightful owner, it is held in\r\nthe Department subject to the owners control for four years, and after\r\nthat time it is conveyed to the Treasury, and goes towards decreasing\r\nthe annual deficit in the Post Office Department. All letters which are\r\nproperly stamped and addressed, and go to their destination, but are\r\nnot delivered at the end of one week, by reason of the person addressed\r\nnot being found, are advertised, either by publishing once in a daily\r\nor weekly paper, or by posting the list in a conspicuous place in the\r\noffice. At the end of four weeks all then undelivered are sent to the\r\ndead letter office. The matter of advertising in newspapers is left to\r\nthe discretion of the Postmaster General, and it is but few of the larger\r\noffices that are allowed to do so. The compensation is fixed by law at\r\none cent for each letter, which is to be paid by the person receiving\r\nthe letter; but by reason of the fact that by far the larger portion of\r\nthose advertised are not delivered, the expense is so great that but\r\nfew offices can be allowed to advertise. All letters which are dropped\r\ninto an office without stamps or only part paid, or the address is not\r\nreadable, are sent at once to the Dead Letter office, except in some few\r\noffices where a bulletin board is provided for the purpose of displaying\r\nto the public letters of this character. When a letter which is wholly\r\nor in part unpaid, and upon which the address is legible, is found to\r\ncontain a valuable enclosure a printed circular is sent to the party\r\naddressed requesting that the requisite amount of postage be forwarded in\r\nstamps and the letter will be forwarded to its proper address.\r\n\r\nA great many articles which are of value only to the senders or the\r\npersons for whom they are intended, such as little baby shoes, stockings,\r\nphotographs, etc., etc., find their way to the Dead Letter office.\r\nSpecial effort is always made to deliver things of this character.\r\nPerhaps the little shoe or stocking may have belonged to some little one\r\nwhose feet are still forever, and is being sent to a grandmother or some\r\nother near relation as a memento of the little one that is gone. Such\r\narticles as this may be of no possible value to any one but the owners,\r\nbut the post office authorities make as great an effort, even greater\r\nto deliver this class of articles, than they do money or jewels. At the\r\npresent time in the Dead Letter office are great stores of small articles\r\nof very little or no value to any but the owners, waiting to be called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nATTORNEY GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be readily perceived that, in a country developing so rapidly as\r\nours, producing, thereby, an almost unbroken series of new situations,\r\nrequiring a cautious application of old laws and the constant enactment\r\nof new ones, and so, a danger of confusion of legislative rules, that the\r\nPresident and his Cabinet would need a legal adviser of eminent ability,\r\nand of extensive acquirements in legal affairs, to give instruction and\r\ncounsel on various lines of action contemplated by the executive branch\r\nof the government, and of the lawful course to be taken in the numerous\r\nparticular cases constantly coming up for determination. Besides,\r\nvarious suits require to be instituted or defended in the courts, by the\r\ngovernment, and some officer is needed to prosecute or defend them in its\r\nname and interest.\r\n\r\nTo answer these requirements, the office of Attorney General was created\r\nby the first Congress in 1789. He is a member of the Cabinet, is\r\nnominated by the President, and confirmed by the Senate, and is removable\r\nat the pleasure of the President. He has an assistant and various clerks\r\nto aid him in the discharge of his responsible duties.\r\n\r\nBy an act passed in 1861 he is made Superintendent of all the Attorneys\r\nand Marshals in all the Judicial Districts of the United States. His\r\noffice is at the seat of Government.\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete list of the Attorneys General:\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEYS GENERAL.\r\n\r\n  Edmund Randolph, Va., Sept. 26, 1789.\r\n  William Bradford, Pa., June 27, 1794.\r\n  Charles Lee, Va., Dec. 10, 1795.\r\n  T.

Electors\r\nhave been chosen in various ways. At first they were often appointed by\r\nthe State Legislatures, or these passed a law directing their election\r\nby the people. This has gradually disappeared, and now the people, by\r\nlaw of Congress assemble on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in\r\nNovember preceding the close of a presidential term, and vote for the\r\nelectors. The electors in each State are called its Electoral College.\r\nThey meet on the first Wednesday in December following their election,\r\nin their respective States, and vote by ballot for a President and\r\nVice-President. These cannot both, according to the Constitution, be\r\ncitizens of the same State. They count, certify, and seal these votes\r\nand send the sealed package by a messenger, appointed for that express\r\npurpose, to the President of the United States Senate. On the second\r\nWednesday in February following, the members of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives assemble together, the packages are opened and the votes\r\ncounted in their presence, and the result is officially proclaimed.\r\nIt is evident that this is now a mere form, and the President and\r\nVice-President are virtually determined by the people in November. It is\r\nnot in harmony with the other parts of our system of government, which\r\naims at simplicity and practical usefulness, and it will probably soon\r\nbe dispensed with. It was originally designed, by those who framed the\r\nConstitution, to act as a check to party spirit, and was expected to\r\nserve a very useful purpose. They felt the great importance attaching\r\nto the office of Chief Magistrate, on whom they had conferred so much\r\npower, and thought, by this means, to raise his election above disturbing\r\ninfluences. It was not expected that the candidates for those offices\r\nwould come in question, in the popular elections. The choice was designed\r\nto be left with the electors, with whom, being chosen by the people for\r\nthat purpose, it was supposed they would feel safe in leaving it. It was\r\nbelieved that a select body of eminent men would act with more prudence\r\nand wisdom than the people at large. But the people felt themselves\r\ncompetent to judge for themselves, and have, like imperious sovereigns,\r\nimposed their choice on the Electors, so that that part of our\r\nconstitutional machinery has become a dead letter. The people know their\r\nown minds better, and are more resolute in imposing their will on their\r\nrepresentatives than was expected; and they have favorably disappointed\r\nthe best hopes of those who believed most in their discretion. So we see\r\nthat the failure of the Electoral System, planned by the Fathers of the\r\nRepublic, is an honorable commentary on the ability of the people for\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nTheir success in making their own choice authoritative has led them\r\nto overlook the incongruity of the system, so that they have never\r\nresolutely required it to be abolished. Perhaps the idea that it might be\r\nuseful in some important crisis of national affairs has had an influence\r\nto prevent interference with it. As its retention is attended with\r\nconsiderable expense, when questions of Economy come to take a leading\r\nplace in public policy it is likely to be laid aside, in form, as well as\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\nThe elections for President, Congressmen, Governors of the States and\r\ntheir Legislatures, determining the general policy of the government,\r\nand the class of men who shall be appointed to the various minor offices\r\nunder its control; those who feel a strong interest in that policy from\r\ntheir judgment of its effect on the welfare of the country, or their\r\ndesire to promote special measures; and those who are anxious to obtain\r\nor hold office, are very warmly interested in them. They divide into\r\nparties according to their views and exert themselves to the utmost to\r\ninfluence the result.\r\n\r\nMost human affairs have their good and bad side, and this is not\r\nan exception. This party warmth is useful in causing discussion,\r\nexamination, and thought, and stirring up the people to a careful study\r\nof their institutions and the principles of government, and the effect\r\nwhich particular measures may have on the public welfare. Its tendency,\r\nin this direction is, to make all the people statesmen—a point of the\r\nhighest importance in a free government, where the People are Sovereign.\r\nThe disadvantage is, that it often awakens an undue degree of passion and\r\nprejudice, the parties and men who are candidates for office abuse and\r\nmisrepresent each other in order to destroy each others influence, when,\r\nperhaps, they are equally in earnest in seeking the good of the country.\r\nFor this there is no apparent remedy, but in the intelligence and good\r\nsense of the people themselves. They must learn to be careful and\r\ncandid in their judgment of men and measures, and to examine all sides\r\nof a question before rendering a decision. All should strive toward this\r\nintelligent moderation during important elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Presidents of the Continental Congress—as the Legislative body of\r\nthe United States was called up to 1789, when the new Constitution went\r\nin effect—were chosen by its members, which then consisted of only one\r\nHouse, in the same manner as the Speaker of the House of Representatives\r\nis chosen now; nor was his authority more extensive. He was simply the\r\npresiding officer of a legislative body; and one that had by no means\r\nthe effective authority of our present Congress, although no body in the\r\nworld ever more deserved the gratitude and reverence of all time; for it\r\nfounded and gave direction and character to a great nation—it may be, the\r\ngreatest the world will ever know.\r\n\r\nThese Presidents had little, except the name, in common with the\r\nPresidents of the United States, as the Constitution made them. The\r\nPresidents were now to be appointed by the people, and become the\r\ndepositaries of the Power of the Nation in Action. It was fit that, in a\r\ngovernment deriving all its authority from the People, as the source of\r\npower, its Special Agent, its acting Representative, should be chosen by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1788 three-fourths of the States had ratified the\r\nConstitution, and it became authoritative as the Fundamental Law of the\r\ncountry. The Continental Congress, therefore, closed its own career by\r\nordering elections for the new Congress, and for the electors who were\r\nto appoint the first President. It directed that these elections should\r\ntake place on the first Wednesday in January, 1789; that the electors\r\nshould meet on the first Wednesday in February following, to discharge\r\nthe duty to which they were appointed; and that, on the first Wednesday\r\nin March, (which, in that year, was the fourth,) Congress should meet,\r\nthe President be inaugurated, and the new government be put in operation.\r\n\r\nThis brought all these important events close upon the heels of one\r\nanother; and on the 4th of March there was not a quorum of the Members\r\nof Congress assembled. The States lay far apart, and the roads were bad\r\nin those times, and at that season of the year. Though a bare quorum had\r\ngathered by the last of March, and many measures of pressing necessity\r\nwere attended to, a full representation was waited for before the\r\nPresident elect was notified that they were ready for his inauguration;\r\nand that event took place only on the 30th of April. The presidential\r\nterm, however, was considered to have legally commenced at the time\r\npreviously ordered, and closed on that day of the year and month; so that\r\nit became the first day of our political year. It commences and closes\r\nthe President’s term of office and ends the regular session of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ELECTION, 1789.\r\n\r\nThere were but 69 electors, and the choice of George Washington for\r\nPresident, and John Adams for Vice-President, was unanimous. He had\r\ndeclared, when resigning his commission as commander-in-chief, that he\r\ntook leave “of all the employments of public life,” and only the earnest\r\nsolicitations of the leading public men of the time, and their opinion\r\nthat he alone could successfully inaugurate the new government, decided\r\nhim to leave his cherished retirement. Washington’s ambition was known\r\nto be free from spot or stain of self seeking, and his moderation and\r\njudgment were trusted in as the sheet anchor of a new government which\r\nmany feared would become too strong for the liberties of the people.\r\nThey dreaded an abuse of power; but they had no fear of such abuse while\r\nwielded by Washington. There was a solid foundation to Washington’s fame,\r\nin his character.\r\n\r\nThe presidential electors were mainly chosen by the State legislatures\r\nduring the times immediately following the adoption of the Constitution.\r\nThat instrument did not decide how they should be chosen, but left it\r\nto the discretion of the State governments. In some States conventions\r\nchose them, and the practice was various; but after a time it proved to\r\nbe more satisfactory to refer the choice directly to the people, and\r\nvery soon the people themselves practically selected the President, the\r\nelectors being pledged to the choice of the candidate favored by their\r\nconstituents, so that their significance was lost. It is a proof of the\r\n_popular_ character of our government. The system of electors indicated\r\na fear of the people; a want of confidence in their judgment and self\r\ncontrol. The electors, it was supposed, would be wiser, less accessible\r\nto passion and caprice than those who elected them. The people set them\r\nquietly aside, and proceeded to do their own work themselves, using the\r\nelectors only to register their decision. Public men have seldom ventured\r\nto oppose the clearly formed and definite purposes of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND ELECTION, 1792.\r\n\r\nWashington was again unanimously elected. He desired to lay down the\r\nburdens of office; but so many perplexing questions and disturbing\r\ninfluences threatened the stability of the government that he could not\r\nbe spared. His name and character were a rock of strength. John Adams\r\nwas re-elected Vice-President. Only 11 States had voted at the first\r\nelection; North Carolina and Rhode Island not having then ratified the\r\nConstitution. They had now done so, and Vermont and Kentucky had been\r\nadmitted, so that there were 15 States voting at this election. There\r\nwere 132 electors. Washington declined another election absolutely, and\r\nthe government had proved so suitable as to be fairly settled in the\r\nconfidence of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD ELECTION, 1796.\r\n\r\nFour persons were voted for at this election.\r\n\r\n  John Adams       received 71 electoral votes.\r\n  Thomas Jefferson     ”    69        ”\r\n  Thomas Pinckney      ”    59        ”\r\n  Aaron Burr           ”    38        ”\r\n\r\nAs, by the Constitutional provision regarding electors, the person\r\nhaving the largest number of votes became President, and the one who had\r\nthe next in number became Vice-President, Adams was now President, and\r\nJefferson Vice-President. Tennessee had now been admitted into the Union,\r\nand there were 16 States voting.\r\n\r\nConflicting views on foreign policy, and vexing questions of internal\r\nadministration began to exert a strong influence, and party spirit, for\r\nthe next twenty years, was very bitter. Mr. Adams was a Federalist; Mr.\r\nJefferson was an anti-Federalist.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH ELECTION, 1800.\r\n\r\nThe same candidates were again in the field. The political parties had\r\nbecome clearly defined. Adams and Pinckney were the Federal candidates,\r\nreceiving—Adams, 64, Pinckney 63, electoral votes, while Jefferson and\r\nBurr had each 73. They were of the anti-Federal, or Republican party.\r\n\r\nThe election did not decide which of the two, Jefferson or Burr,\r\nshould be President and Vice-President, and, by the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution, the House of Representatives decided it in favor\r\nof Jefferson. Party heats were so great that it took 7 days and 36\r\nballots to reach this result. It was felt that there was a defect in the\r\nConstitutional provision that left it undecided, in such a case, which\r\nof the candidates was the choice of the electors for President, and\r\nit resulted in the ratification of the 12th amendment before the next\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe Federal party never regained the power of administration lost at\r\nthis election, though they continued to be a strong opposition until\r\nthe close of the war of 1812. But an opposition, to criticize and\r\npoint out faults, is often more useful out of office than in; and the\r\nRepublican party was obliged to adopt substantially the general features\r\nof the policy pursued by their predecessors, while they added some very\r\nimportant ones of their own, in their disposition to favor popular rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH ELECTION, 1804.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson and George Clinton were the candidates of the\r\nRepublicans. Charles C. Pinckney and Rufus King of the Federalists.\r\n\r\nJefferson was popular, and received 162 votes—Clinton receiving the same.\r\nPinckney and King received only 14 votes. The admission of Ohio, in 1802,\r\nmade 17 States to vote at this election.\r\n\r\nThe Federal party was much weaker than in the following election.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH ELECTION, 1808.\r\n\r\nJames Madison was the Republican candidate for President, and Geo.\r\nClinton for Vice-President. Pinckney and King were again candidates on\r\nthe part of the Federalists.\r\n\r\n  Madison received       123 electoral votes.\r\n  Clinton    ”           113        ”\r\n  Pinckney and King each, 47        ”\r\n\r\nGeo. Clinton died before the end of his term. There was the same number\r\nof States voting as in the previous election, viz.: 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH ELECTION, 1812.\r\n\r\nMadison was re-elected, with Elbridge Gerry as Vice-President. They each\r\nreceived 128 electoral votes.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton and Jared Ingersoll, the candidates of the Federal party,\r\nreceived, Clinton 89, Ingersoll 57, votes. Louisiana having been recently\r\nadmitted into the Union, there were now 18 States.\r\n\r\nWar with England was formally declared this year. It had actually\r\nbegun on the ocean sometime before. It was a very trying and painful\r\npresidential term, owing to the violent and injudicious opposition made\r\nto the measures of the government, and the unfortunate choice of generals\r\nfor the first two years; yet the ultimate result was highly creditable to\r\nthe standing and reputation of the United States, and put an end to the\r\nannoying and insulting interferences with our vessels and commerce that\r\nhad brought it on. It was a war waged for the honor and inviolability of\r\nour Flag, which was ever after duly respected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH ELECTION, 1816.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins were the candidates of the\r\nRepublicans, who now began to be called Democrats. The Federalist party\r\nwas now near its end. It nominated Rufus King who received 34 electoral\r\nvotes, Monroe obtaining 183.\r\n\r\nIndiana was admitted this year in time to vote, making 19 States.\r\nThis period marked an important era in the internal history, as well\r\nas foreign relations, of the country. The period of trial for the\r\nConstitution was passed, and full confidence began to be felt in the\r\nsystem it had founded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH ELECTION, 1820.\r\n\r\nMonroe and Tompkins were re-elected, the vote being substantially\r\nunanimous, for the first and last time since Washington. The close\r\nof this term made the Republican rule in the administration 24 years\r\nin succession, under three Presidents, each once re-elected, and all\r\ncitizens of Virginia.\r\n\r\nFour new States had been admitted during the previous term, viz.:\r\nMississippi, Illinois, Alabama, and Maine, so that 23 States took part in\r\nthis election.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH ELECTION, 1824.\r\n\r\nFour candidates were in the field for the presidency at this election.\r\nMissouri having been admitted since the ninth election there were 24\r\nStates to vote. The whole number of electors was 261; necessary to a\r\nchoice, 131.\r\n\r\nThe candidates and votes were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Andrew Jackson           99\r\n  John Quincy Adams        84\r\n  Wm. H. Crawford          41\r\n  Henry Clay               31\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution the House of Representatives was required to select\r\nthe President from the 3 candidates having the highest number of votes.\r\nThey were to vote by States, and a majority of States would elect. J. Q.\r\nAdams received the vote of 13 States, and was declared elected. John C.\r\nCalhoun having received 182 electoral votes for the Vice-Presidency, was\r\nthereby elected to that office. 18 of the States appointed the electors\r\nby popular vote and 6 appointed them by their legislatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEVENTH ELECTION, 1828.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson was elected President, and John C. Calhoun re-elected\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams and Richard Rush were also candidates for President\r\nand Vice-President, respectively. The contest was very hot and bitter.\r\nJackson received 178, and Adams 171 electoral votes. The Popular vote\r\nwas 650,028 for Jackson to 512,158 for Adams. The number of electors\r\nwas the same as in the 10th election. The most violent excitement\r\ndivided the north and the south on the tariff question, which culminated\r\nduring this term in the “nullification ordinance,” which Jackson met\r\nwith the decision and vigor for which he was distinguished, ending\r\nin the submission of the nullifiers. Calhoun resigned his office as\r\nVice-President, Dec. 28th, 1832. He was the leader of the nullifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWELFTH ELECTION, 1832.\r\n\r\nJackson’s vigorous dealing with nullification was highly approved by the\r\npeople, and he was re-elected, with Martin Van Buren as Vice-President.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay was the candidate of the Whig party for President, and John\r\nSergeant for Vice-President.\r\n\r\n  Jackson received   682,502 popular, and 219 electoral votes.\r\n  Clay       ”       550,189        ”      49        ”\r\n                     -------             ----\r\n  Jackson’s majority 132,313              170\r\n\r\nVan Buren received 189 electoral votes for Vice-President. Twenty-four\r\nStates voted at this election.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTEENTH ELECTION, 1836.\r\n\r\nVan Buren was run, by the Democrats, for the Presidency, and Richard M.\r\nJohnson for the Vice-Presidency, against Wm. H. Harrison, Hugh L. White,\r\nDaniel Webster, and W. P. Mangum. Van Buren’s vote was 762,149 popular,\r\nand 170 electoral. Harrison and the others united was 736,736 popular,\r\nand 124 electoral. The whole number of electors being 294, the number\r\nnecessary to a choice was 148. Johnson failed by one electoral vote\r\nto be elected to the Vice-Presidency, and the case went to the Senate\r\nfor decision, as directed by the Constitution. The remaining electoral\r\nvotes for Vice-President being divided between 3 candidates, Johnson was\r\nappointed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nMichigan and Arkansas having been admitted this year took part in the\r\nelection, making 26 States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTEENTH ELECTION, 1840.\r\n\r\nThe Whig party this year concentrated on Wm. H. Harrison for President,\r\nand John Tyler for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats opposed them with Van Buren and Johnson again. The country\r\nhad been passing through a financial crisis of extreme severity during\r\nthe thirteenth presidential term, and this election, involving the\r\ndecision of a financial policy, was very exciting.\r\n\r\nHarrison was an Ohio farmer, and, the Democrats said, “lived in a log\r\ncabin and drank hard cider.” The Whigs took the hint, built log cabins\r\nto hold their campaign gatherings in, drank much hard cider, and sung\r\nstirring political songs.\r\n\r\n  Harrison’s popular vote was 1,274,783—his electoral vote 234\r\n  Van Buren’s        ”        1,128,702          ”          60\r\n                              ---------                    ---\r\n  Majority,                      46,081                    174\r\n\r\nTyler’s vote as Vice-President was the same as Harrison’s.\r\n\r\nHarrison died on the 4th of April, one month after his inauguration, and\r\nJohn Tyler succeeded to the Presidency. His term was made remarkable by\r\nhis disagreement with the measures of Congress, on financial questions.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time a Vice-President had been called on to serve as\r\na substitute for the President. There were 26 States taking part in this\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTEENTH ELECTION, 1844.\r\n\r\nThe slavery question entered into this election as a leading point.\r\nThe Republic of Texas asked admission into the Union. As it would be\r\ncertain to be a slave State, and many of the people objected to extending\r\nthat institution while others favored it, the parties took it up; the\r\nDemocrats favoring the admission, the Whigs opposing.\r\n\r\nJames K. Polk was the candidate for President, and Geo. M. Dallas for\r\nVice-President, run by the Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs opposed against them Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen.\r\n\r\n  The vote for Polk and Dallas was 1,335,834, electoral vote 170\r\n       ”    Clay and Frelinghuysen 1,297,033,        ”       105\r\n                                   ---------                 ---\r\n  Polk and Dallas’ majority,          38,801                  65\r\n\r\nThis was the third time Mr. Clay had been defeated as a candidate for the\r\nPresidency, to the great regret of many, even of those who voted against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico followed as a consequence of the policy of the United\r\nStates government, decided upon in this election. Texas had formerly been\r\na part of Mexico, and that country considered its admission into the\r\nUnion as an act of hostility to herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTEENTH ELECTION, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were successful in this election, owing to a division in the\r\nranks of the Democratic party. The Whigs nominated Gen. Zachary Taylor\r\nfor President, and Millard Fillmore for Vice-President; the Democrats\r\nLewis Cass for President, and Wm. O. Butler for Vice-President; the Free\r\nSoil Democrats—who opposed the extension of slavery—Martin Van Buren for\r\nPresident, and Charles F. Adams for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe vote resulted thus:\r\n\r\n  Taylor and Fillmore’s popular vote 1,362,024, electoral vote 163\r\n  Cass and Butler’s          ”       1,222,419,        ”       127\r\n  Van Buren and Adams’       ”         291,678.\r\n\r\nThe third ticket secured no electoral votes.\r\n\r\nFour new States had been admitted into the Union since the 15th election,\r\nviz.: Texas, Florida, Iowa, and Wisconsin; and 30 States voted this year.\r\n\r\nGen. Taylor died July 9th, 1850, one year, four months, and four days\r\nafter his inauguration, and Mr. Fillmore filled out his term of office.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH ELECTION, 1852.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous Presidential term the subject of slavery, and the\r\nstrategy of politicians in favor of and against it, absorbed public\r\nattention. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 opened the whole\r\nquestion, and a trial of strength as to which side should occupy the\r\nnew territory, was prepared for. The crisis of preparation had not been\r\nreached when this election occurred, and comparatively little interest\r\nwas taken in it.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats nominated Franklin Pierce for President, and Wm. R. King\r\nfor Vice-President; the Whigs chose as their candidates Gen. Winfield\r\nScott for President, and Wm. A. Graham for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nPierce and King received, of popular votes 1,590,490, of electoral, 254.\r\nScott and Graham received, of popular votes, 1,378,589, of electoral,\r\n42. Pierce’s majority, on popular vote, 211,901, on electoral, 212.\r\n\r\nCalifornia had been admitted since the 16th election, and there were 31\r\nStates to vote in this.\r\n\r\nThis was the last election in which the Whig party nominated a candidate.\r\nThe contest in regard to slave and free territory absorbing all the\r\ninterest of the country, the parties were rearranged, those in favor\r\nof slavery, or wishing to leave that institution undisturbed, gathered\r\nto the Democratic party; while those wishing to actively oppose the\r\nextension of slavery to territory not yet occupied by it, united, under\r\nthe name of the Republican party, the Whigs becoming extinct, as a party.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH ELECTION, 1856.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats nominated James Buchanan, and John C. Breckenridge for\r\nPresident and Vice-President; the Republicans, John C. Fremont and\r\nWilliam L. Dayton. A third party, in favor of putting only native\r\nAmericans in office, voted for Millard Fillmore and Andrew J. Donnelson.\r\nThe result was the following:\r\n\r\nPopular vote for Buchanan and Breckenridge 1,803,029, electoral, 174.\r\nPopular vote for Fremont and Dayton 1,342,164, electoral, 114. Popular\r\nvote for Fillmore and Donnelson, 874,625, electoral, 8.\r\n\r\nBuchanan had only what is called a plurality popular vote; the two others\r\nunited had a majority over him of 413,760 votes. A majority of electoral\r\nvotes, however, was 149, and he received 174, and a majority of 52\r\nelectoral votes over the others united.\r\n\r\nOnly 31 States voted at this election. Mr. Buchanan was much blamed for\r\nnot taking more vigorous measures to quench the secession movement that\r\ncommenced in the last months of his administration. The contrast between\r\nhis course and Jackson’s in 1832 was very marked.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINETEENTH ELECTION, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party nominated Abraham Lincoln for President, and\r\nHannibal Hamlin for Vice-President. The south, finding it impossible to\r\nuphold the slavery extension system against the growing Republican party,\r\nand the compromise that had protected that system having been laid aside\r\nin 1850, must submit to the gradual extinction of slavery, or withdraw\r\nfrom the Union. They chose the latter, and favored the division of the\r\nDemocratic party, which was still much the largest, into several parts.\r\nThree tickets of that party were run, against one in the Republican,\r\nwhich assured the election of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Democrats voted mainly for Stephen A. Douglas and H. V.\r\nJohnson; the Southern Democrats for John C. Breckenridge and Joseph\r\nLane; and those who wished to stop the contest on the slavery question\r\naltogether, on both sides, voted for John Bell and Edward Everett. The\r\nresult was as follows:\r\n\r\n  The vote for Lincoln and Hamlin was 1,866,452, electoral 180\r\n       ”       Douglas and Johnson    1,370,157,     ”      72\r\n       ”       Breckenridge and Lane    847,953,     ”      39\r\n       ”       Bell and Everett         590,631,     ”      12\r\n\r\nThe three divisions of the Democrats together had a popular majority\r\nof 947,289 over the Republicans, but the latter had a majority of 57\r\nelectoral votes over all the others united.\r\n\r\nTwo new States had been admitted since the eighteenth election, Minnesota\r\nand Oregon, and there were 33 States voting. The census of 1860 gave the\r\npopulation as 31,148,048. All the votes cast at this election amounted\r\nto 4,680,193, the largest number by more than 500,000 that had ever been\r\nknown. The Southern States seceded within a few months, and the Civil War\r\nbegan. It was remarkable as the most gigantic war of its kind, perhaps of\r\nany kind, known in history; and for the obstinate bravery and resolution\r\ndisplayed on both sides. It continued during this entire presidential\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTIETH ELECTION, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe election this year was confined to the States that had remained loyal\r\nto the Constitution and the Union. Eleven States had seceded.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans re-nominated Lincoln for President, with Andrew Johnson\r\nfor Vice-President. The Democratic party nominated Gen. Geo. B. McClellan\r\nfor President, and Geo. H. Pendleton for Vice-President. The result was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  The popular vote for Lincoln and Johnson was 2,223,035\r\n        ”      ”       McClellan and Pendleton 1,811,754\r\n                                               ---------\r\n    Lincoln’s popular majority                   411,281\r\n\r\n  Electoral votes for Lincoln     212\r\n       ”       ”      McClellan    21\r\n                                  ---\r\n    Lincoln’s electoral majority  191\r\n\r\nThe total number of popular votes was 4,034,789. Lincoln’s vote at this\r\nelection was the largest that had ever been cast for one candidate,\r\nthough there were less votes cast by all parties by 600,000 than in the\r\nnineteenth election. Two new States, Kansas and West Virginia, had been\r\nadmitted since the previous election, which with the 11 in rebellion\r\nomitted, left 24 States voting.\r\n\r\nThe civil war closed with the submission of the seceded States to the\r\ngeneral government soon after Lincoln’s re-inauguration; but he was\r\nassassinated about the same time, on the evening of April 13th, 1865,\r\nand died on the following day, leaving a nation in mourning, and the\r\ncivilized world struck with horror. Andrew Johnson acted as President\r\nduring the remainder of this term. Mr. Johnson’s administration was\r\nmarked by the great difference in the policy of reconstructing the\r\nseceded States adopted by him and by the Congress, by the limitations\r\nwhich the latter threw around him, and the attempt to impeach him, which\r\nfailed by a few votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-FIRST ELECTION, 1868.\r\n\r\nGen. Ulysses S. Grant was nominated by the Republicans for President, and\r\nSchuyler Colfax for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe nominees of the Democratic party were Horatio Seymour and Francis P.\r\nBlair.\r\n\r\nGrant’s popular majority was 309,588. Questions of reconstruction and\r\nfinance were determined by this election, the people upholding the policy\r\npursued by Congress since the close of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-SECOND ELECTION, 1872.\r\n\r\nGrant was nominated by the Republican party for President, and Henry\r\nWilson for Vice-President. The Democrats nominated Horace Greeley for\r\nPresident, and B. Gratz Brown for Vice-President. A second Democratic\r\nparty had a ticket, nominating Chas. O’Connor and J. Q. Adams.\r\n\r\nGrant’s popular majority was 762,991; and he received 218 electoral\r\nvotes. 30 States gave him majorities, Pennsylvania reaching 137,000\r\nmajority in his favor. The whole popular vote at this election was\r\n6,431,149. The colored people voted for the first time, under the\r\namendment to the Constitution abolishing the distinction in citizenship\r\nin regard to color.\r\n\r\nThe elections are now held on the same day in all the States, by a\r\ngeneral law. The number of States voting at the 22d election was\r\nthirty-seven. This election set a final seal on the policy of the\r\nRepublican party, leaving the country free to turn its attention to other\r\nquestions relating to its internal interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nCABINETS OF ALL THE PRESIDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience of reference we insert a list of the members of the\r\nCabinet in each administration from 1789 down to 1874, to which is added\r\nthe name of the Vice-President of each presidential term, though he is\r\nnot a member of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ADMINISTRATION, FROM 1789 TO 1797—7 YEARS, 10 MONTHS, AND 4 DAYS.\r\n\r\n  George Washington, Va., President.\r\n  John Adams, Mass., Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABINET.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Jefferson, Va., Secretary of State.\r\n  Edmund Randolph, Va.,      ”          ”\r\n  Timothy Pickering, Mass.,  ”          ”\r\n  Alexander Hamilton, N.

All government consists of three steps, series, or departments. It has\r\na Rule by which its action is governed; and this embraces the general\r\nprinciples guiding all action, as well as the special rules of conduct\r\nin regard to limited classes of actions—the next step in the series is\r\nthe action demanded to put its rules in actual force—to apply them—the\r\nthird is, to determine the application of the rule when supposed to\r\nbe violated, and the agreement of the special rule with the general\r\nprinciple. That is to say, government is divided into the Legislative,\r\nor law making power; the Executive, or law enforcing power; and the\r\nJudicial, or law discriminating, or judging, power.\r\n\r\n2. In some governments all these are in the same hands, and this produces\r\na Despotism. In others they are variously divided or mixed. In our\r\ncountry the separation between them is made as distinct as possible. The\r\nPeople are regarded as the source or fountain of Power. The Constitution\r\nrepresents, in its general Principles or Rules, the Will and purposes\r\nof the People; and outside of the principles or regulations of this\r\ninstrument no legislation is valid. The Constitution, emanating from\r\nthe people, defines the boundary of all the Departments. Congress\r\nis the law-making power, enacting within the prescribed limits. The\r\nJudiciary takes care that these limits are not overstepped by legislative\r\nenactments, or executive action. The executive power, or the President,\r\nis the concentrated force, the vigorous Arm, of the government.\r\n\r\nIt is Congress, the Legislative Authority, that we have now to consider.\r\n\r\n3. The National Congress is a body of men representing, and acting in the\r\nplace of, the people. They are elected by the people to enact laws for\r\nthe public good—to do all—and no more nor less—than the people would do,\r\nif it were possible for them to assemble in one great body and make the\r\nlaws by which they wish to be governed.\r\n\r\nIt was constituted as wisely, to guard against the errors to which\r\nhumanity is liable, as the experience of the past permitted to the\r\nthoughtful and patriotic statesmen who had charge of the organization\r\nof the government, when the successful termination of the War of\r\nIndependence left the interests of a new Nation in their hands. England,\r\nfrom which they had mostly sprung, and which governed them until that\r\nperiod, was in possession of the freest and most enlightened government\r\nof those times, in the Old World; and they copied from her institutions\r\nand general structure what they judged adapted to our circumstances;\r\nprudently avoiding untried experiments, as far as possible.\r\n\r\n4. Congress, like the English Parliament, consists of two Houses,\r\none, the House of Representatives, (answering to the English House of\r\nCommons) being directly elected, for a short term, by the people, so as\r\nto express their views and interests as clearly as possible; the other,\r\nthe Senate, (answering partially to the English House of Lords) appointed\r\nby the State Legislatures for a longer term, and from among statesmen\r\nof acknowledged ability and mature character and experience. This was\r\nexpected to supply the necessary check to hasty and ill considered\r\naction, as they were required to mutually agree on all laws enacted.\r\n\r\n5. Both are required to assemble, at the same time, in the Capitol\r\nat Washington, on the first Monday in December of each year. This is\r\nthe regular session—extra sessions being occasionally called by the\r\nPresident when unusual circumstances demand it.\r\n\r\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected for two years,\r\nthe members of the Senate for six. As the first contains by far the\r\nlargest number, a Congress is said to exist for two years, and the 20th\r\nCongress would be the one existing during the 40th and 41st years of the\r\nRepublic, dating from the first Congress in 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE\r\n\r\n6. Is composed of two persons, chosen by the legislature of each State,\r\nto represent it as a whole. It makes no difference whether the State be\r\nlarge or small, whether population counts by the million or the thousand.\r\nThe States are sovereign in their sphere, and this constitution of the\r\nSenate keeps that fact in view, operates against undue centralization of\r\npower, and oppression of the smaller States by the larger.\r\n\r\n7. A Senator must be thirty years of age, must have been nine years\r\na citizen, (he may have been born in a foreign State, and a citizen\r\nof it previously,) and must be a citizen of the State—(a voter in it)\r\nat the time of appointment. He is appointed for six years. The Senate\r\nis arranged in three classes so that the terms of one-third of the\r\nwhole number shall expire every two years. They may be re-elected as\r\noften as the State legislatures choose. In one case, a Senator was\r\ncontinued thirty years in the Senate, without intermission. It has equal\r\nlegislative power with the House of Representatives, except that it\r\ncannot originate laws for raising money, but it must approve and adopt\r\nall laws made by the House to render them valid. It has some powers that\r\ndo not belong to the House. It confirms or rejects the nominations of the\r\nPresident, to office, and the treaties he makes with foreign powers, and\r\nis the only High Court of Impeachment.\r\n\r\n8. When the Senate meets to consider the nominations of the President\r\nto office, it is called an Executive Session, and only a majority of\r\nvotes is required to approve or confirm them; but when a treaty is to\r\nbe ratified, or judgment given in a case of impeachment, a vote of\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present is required.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President of the United States is the presiding officer of\r\nthe Senate; but in case of a vacancy in that office, when he is acting\r\nas President, or if he be absent, it chooses a president from its own\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\n9. Is composed of persons elected by the people in the various States, in\r\nproportion to the number of inhabitants. A Representative is elected for\r\na term of two years. He must be twenty-five years of age, must have been\r\na citizen of the United States seven years, and must be a citizen of the\r\nState he represents. This is often called the “Lower House,” or popular\r\nbranch of the National Legislature, as the Senate is sometimes called the\r\n“Upper House,” because it is more select, and greater in dignity.\r\n\r\n10. The House of Representatives has the sole power of presenting\r\narticles of Impeachment, and it alone can originate laws for raising\r\nrevenue. A larger part of the laws are actually originated in it,\r\nbecause it is more numerous, its members better known to the people\r\nwhom they immediately represent, and the people are better acquainted\r\nwith them; and more petitions for particular laws are sent to them.\r\nEach representative is voted for by the people of his Congressional\r\nDistrict alone, and not by all the people of each State; and he specially\r\nrepresents the views and wants of his District.\r\n\r\nIn each branch of Congress, when a Bill, or plan of a law, has been\r\npassed, it is sent to the other House, where it is referred to a\r\nCommittee who examine it, and report on it to the House; by which it is\r\ndiscussed and adopted, amended, or rejected according to its judgment,\r\nand returned to the House in which it originated. By this method every\r\nlaw is meant to be subjected to a careful and cool investigation, its\r\ndefects discovered and corrected, and its appropriateness clearly made\r\nmanifest. Whoever will examine, with care and thoroughness the whole\r\nstructure of our government will everywhere discover traces of the same\r\nwisdom and watchful foresight. He will see reason for more admiration\r\nof the prudent statesmanship of those who organized our institutions,\r\nand feel less surprised at the wonderful prosperity of the country, and\r\nat the strength of the government when subjected to the severest trial.\r\nEverything human is more or less imperfect, and we shall never be without\r\nsubjects of complaint, and opportunities for improvement; but every\r\nAmerican, well informed concerning his own and foreign governments, will\r\ndiscover many weighty reasons for self-congratulation and pride that\r\nour first statesmen and people were so wise and prudent in laying the\r\nfoundation, and that their successors have built on it with so much skill.\r\n\r\n11. The presiding officer in the House of Representatives is called “The\r\nSpeaker,” and is chosen by the House, at the beginning of each Congress.\r\nHe serves during its two years of existence. The Clerk of the House and\r\nits minor officers are chosen by its members—and each House makes its\r\nown rules, or Parliamentary Laws. The term Congress properly covers both\r\nbranches of the National Legislature; but, by custom, the members of\r\nthe upper house are called Senators, and those of the lower Members of\r\nCongress, (commonly abbreviated to M. C.)\r\n\r\n12. The Compensation of Members of Congress was originally fixed at eight\r\ndollars a day, but has, of late years, been several times changed. In\r\n1856 it was made $3,000 per session, or $6,000 for a Congress of two\r\nyears. In 1866 it was increased to $5,000 per session, and, in 1873 to\r\n$7,500 per session, the Speaker of the House, and the President of the\r\nSenate, by this last law, receiving $10,000 per year; but it produced so\r\nmuch dissatisfaction among the people that the law was changed at the\r\nfollowing session, and they now receive $5,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n13. The members of each house receive the same compensation. Mileage is\r\nallowed them in addition to the salary. This has been forty cents per\r\nmile, by the usual routes between the members residence and Washington.\r\nIn 1865 it was reduced to twenty cents per mile, which still seems\r\nmore adapted to the days of stages and slow traveling than to the\r\nmodern improvements in rapidity and cheapness. They formerly enjoyed\r\nthe franking privilege, so called, i. e.: they could send letters and\r\ndocuments through the mails free. This was abolished in 1873, and they\r\nnow pay their postage, the same as other people.\r\n\r\n14. The first Congress under the Constitution met in New York City, where\r\ntwo sessions were held, when it was removed to Philadelphia. It remained\r\nthere until 1800, when Washington became the capital. The Capitol there,\r\nin which Congress meets, is one of the largest buildings in the world;\r\nand the offices for the different executive Departments are immense\r\nstructures. In 1874 there were 37 States and therefore 74 Senators. The\r\nnumber of Representatives was fixed by a law of March, 1873, at 292, at\r\nwhich number it will remain until the next census in 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS—CONGRESSMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Each State is entitled to a number of Representatives in Congress\r\nproportioned to its inhabitants; but, instead of counting the whole\r\nnumber together, and leaving all the people in the State to vote for all\r\nthe representatives of their State, it is divided into districts, each\r\ncontaining the prescribed number entitled to representation. The voters,\r\nthen, in each district, select or nominate the men they wish to vote\r\nfor—and thus they find it easy to send men they know and on whom they can\r\nrely to secure their interests. Besides, it is more convenient for them\r\nto meet and ascertain by consultation who would be most acceptable to\r\nthe majority of those interested. Each Member of Congress, therefore, is\r\nchosen by a single district. The districting of States is done by their\r\nState Legislatures.\r\n\r\n2. Sometimes a State is admitted into the Union before it has as many\r\ninhabitants as the law requires to one Congressman, in which case the\r\nlaw is relaxed, and they are permitted at least one Representative.\r\nContiguous counties or towns are set apart in this way and numbered as\r\n1st, 2nd, 3rd, &c., Congressional District. In large cities as many\r\nwards, lying together, as include the requisite number, are erected into\r\nDistricts. In case the number of Congressmen allotted to a State is\r\nlarger than the number of districts, those in excess are voted for by the\r\nState at large. They are arranged as soon as possible after every census,\r\nso that this does not often occur. In the Western States the number\r\ncontinually increases and changes must be made after each census. By this\r\nmeans the balance of power gradually follows the emigration from East to\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRESSMEN.\r\n\r\n3. We have already remarked, in the chapter on Congress that, though the\r\nterm Congressman properly applies to the members of both Houses, it is by\r\ncommon usage, confined to members of the lower House, those of the upper\r\nHouse being distinguished as Senators, so that the abbreviation M. C.\r\n(Member of Congress) is understood to specify a Representative.\r\n\r\n4. These are the only members of any branch of the government who are\r\nchosen and elected directly by the people, and we may see herein the\r\npropriety of their having the control of all enactments for raising\r\nmoney, this being a point of vital interest to the people. The short term\r\nassigned them, (two years,) and their election by Districts, enables\r\nthe people to interfere very soon if their purse strings are drawn\r\ntoo widely open—a very satisfactory reflection to the economical. Any\r\ncitizen, whether native or foreign born, may become a Member of Congress,\r\nif he can obtain the consent of the voters in his district; but he must\r\nhave been a citizen during the previous seven years. It is an office of\r\ndignity and responsibility, and the welfare of the country depends on the\r\nwisdom of the people in their choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the capitol there is a large library, consisting of two parts;\r\none part called the Congressional library, the other, the law library.\r\nThe latter is made a part of the former by an act of Congress. Both\r\nare subject to the same laws and rules, and both are supported by\r\nappropriations made by Congress.\r\n\r\nThis institution, called as a whole, “The Congressional Library,”\r\ncontains the works supposed to be useful to legislators, but is\r\nnot confined to their use alone. Its use has been extended to the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court; to all the heads of departments; to the\r\nAttorney General; to all the members of the diplomatic corps, (foreign\r\nministers); to the secretary of the Senate; to the clerk of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to the chaplains of Congress, to all ex-Presidents, and\r\nto the solicitor of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n2. It has a librarian, appointed by the President and Senate, who is\r\nallowed to appoint two assistants. No book or map is allowed to be taken\r\nout of the library by any person, except the President, Vice-President,\r\nmembers of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nPeople in general, who are interested to do so, may obtain information\r\nfrom the books and records when properly authorized, under such\r\nrestrictions as the circumstances require.\r\n\r\n3. Here are kept all the laws which have ever been enacted by Congress,\r\ntogether with a record of all its proceedings, the laws of all the\r\ndifferent States, with many of those of foreign countries; also a\r\nlarge collection of books on promiscuous subjects, useful to Members\r\nof Congress and to those who have to administer the government. No\r\nwhere else can so complete a history of the acts and proceedings of the\r\ngovernment be found, as in the Congressional library at Washington.\r\n\r\nThis institution dates back to the year 1800, when an act was passed\r\nmaking the first appropriation of $5,000 for its establishment. The books\r\npurchased with this $5,000, with those belonging to both Houses, were\r\nplaced together, and thus this library was commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Copyright is an exclusive privilege given to any citizen, or resident\r\nin the United States to print, publish, or sell any book, map, chart,\r\nengraving, or musical composition of which he or she is the author or\r\nproprietor. This right is given by the laws of Congress. No State can\r\ngive it. The object is to encourage authors, and to compensate them for\r\ntheir labors, which they could not be sure of obtaining if any one might\r\npublish and sell their productions. A copyright conveys all the rights of\r\nownership, and may be bought and sold like other property.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR SECURING COPYRIGHTS UNDER THE REVISED ACT OF CONGRESS,\r\nWHICH TOOK EFFECT JULY 8, 1870.\r\n\r\n1. A printed copy of the title of the book, map, chart, dramatic or\r\nmusical composition, engraving, cut, print, photograph, or a description\r\nof the painting, drawing, chromo, statue, statuary, or model or design\r\nfor a work of the fine arts, for which copyright is desired, must be sent\r\nby mail, prepaid, addressed, “Librarian of Congress, Washington, D. C.”\r\nThis must be done before publication of the book or other article.\r\n\r\n2. A fee of 50 cents, for recording the title of each book or other\r\narticle, must be inclosed with the title as above, and 50 cents in\r\naddition (or $1 in all) for each certificate of copyright under the seal\r\nof the Librarian of Congress, which will be transmitted by return mail.\r\n\r\n3. Within ten days after publication of each book or other article, two\r\ncomplete copies of the best edition issued must be sent, to perfect the\r\ncopyright, with the address\r\n\r\n    LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nIt is optional with those sending books and other articles to perfect\r\ncopyright, to send them by mail or express; but, in either case, the\r\ncharges are to be prepaid by the senders. Without the deposit of copies\r\nabove required, the copyright is void, and a penalty of $25 is incurred.\r\nNo copy is required to be deposited elsewhere.\r\n\r\n4. No copyright hereafter issued is valid unless notice is given by\r\ninserting in every copy published, on the title page or the page\r\nfollowing, if it be a book; or, if a map, chart, musical composition,\r\nprint, cut, engraving, photograph, painting, drawing, chromo, statue,\r\nstatuary, or model or design intended to be perfected as a work of the\r\nfine arts, by inscribing upon some portion of the face or front thereof,\r\nor on the face of the substance on which the same is mounted, the\r\nfollowing words, viz.: _Entered according to act of Congress, in the year\r\n____, by ____, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington._\r\n\r\nThe law imposes a penalty of $100 upon any person who has not obtained\r\ncopyright who shall insert the notice “_Entered according to act of\r\nCongress_,” etc., or words of the same import, in or upon any book or\r\nother article.\r\n\r\n5. Any author may reserve the right to translate or dramatize his own\r\nwork. In this case notice should be given by printing the words, _Right\r\nof translation reserved_; or, _All rights reserved_, below the notice\r\nof copyright entry, and notifying the Librarian of Congress of such\r\nreservation, to be entered upon the record.\r\n\r\n6. Each copyright secures the exclusive right of publishing the book or\r\narticle copyrighted for a term of twenty-eight years. At the end of that\r\ntime, the author or designer, or his widow or children, may secure a\r\nrenewal for the further term of fourteen years, making forty-two years in\r\nall. Applications for renewal must be accompanied by explicit statement\r\nof ownership in the case of the author, or of relationship in the case of\r\nhis heirs, and must state definitely the date and place of entry of the\r\noriginal copyright.\r\n\r\n7. The time within which any work copyrighted may be issued from the\r\npress is not limited by any law or regulation, but depends upon the\r\ndiscretion of the proprietor. A copyright may be secured for a projected\r\nwork as well as for a completed one.\r\n\r\n8. Any copyright is assignable in law by any instrument of writing,\r\nbut such assignment must be recorded in the office of the Librarian of\r\nCongress within sixty days from its date. The fee for this record is\r\nfifteen cents for every 100 words, and ten cents for every 100 words for\r\na copy of the record of assignment.\r\n\r\n9. A copy of the record (or duplicate certificate) of any copyright entry\r\nwill be furnished under seal, at the rate of fifty cent each.\r\n\r\n10. In the case of books published in more than one volume, if issued\r\nor sold separately, or of periodicals published in numbers, or of\r\nengravings, photographs, or other articles published with variations, a\r\ncopyright is to be taken out for each volume of a book, or number of a\r\nperiodical, or variety, as to size or inscription, of any other article.\r\n\r\n11. To secure a copyright for a painting, statue, or model or design\r\nintended to be perfected as a work of the fine arts, so as to prevent\r\ninfringement by copying, engraving, or vending such design, a definite\r\ndescription must accompany the application for copyright, and a\r\nphotograph of the same, at least as large as “cabinet size,” must be\r\nmailed to the Librarian of Congress within ten days from the completion\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\n12. Every applicant for a copyright must state distinctly the name and\r\nresidence of the claimant, and whether the right is claimed as author,\r\ndesigner, or proprietor. No affidavit or formal application is required.\r\n\r\nUp to 1849 the Secretary of State had the care of issuing copyrights. It\r\nwas then assigned to the newly created Department of the Interior, and so\r\nremained until 1870, when it was transferred to the Librarian of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nPRESIDING OFFICERS OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. These are the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House\r\nof Representatives. The latter is chosen by ballot of the Members of\r\nthe House. As this position gives him considerable influence over the\r\ncourse of legislation the party having a majority in the House are\r\ncareful to select one on whose sympathy with their views and aims they\r\ncan rely. When there is nearly or quite a balance of parties, it becomes\r\nan important and difficult matter to adjust; and has, in some instances,\r\nrequired a long struggle to elect the Speaker. The result, in such a\r\ncase, usually determines which shall control the general legislation of\r\nthat Congress.\r\n\r\n2. The President of the Senate, under ordinary circumstances, is\r\ndetermined by the Constitution, that instrument devolving the office on\r\nthe Vice-President. It is the only active duty assigned him while the\r\nPresident is in condition to perform the duties belonging to that office.\r\nIt seems to befit his relations, being the highest honorary place in the\r\ngovernment below that of President, subjects him to no superior, and,\r\nfrom the part the Senate takes in the responsibilities of the President,\r\nmakes him acquainted with the general conduct of affairs; which may be an\r\nimportant advantage to him should he be called to act as President. In\r\nthe latter case, and in case of the decease, resignation, or disability\r\nof the Vice-President, the Senate proceeds to elect its President in\r\nthe same way as in the House of Representatives, i. e.: by ballot, for a\r\ncandidate among its own members.\r\n\r\n3. Their duties are to open every sitting of their respective Houses by\r\ncalling the members to order at the appointed time, on the appearance\r\nof a quorum to cause the journal of the preceding day to be read, to\r\npreserve order and decorum during the deliberations, to decide questions\r\nof order that may arise, (from which an appeal may be taken to the House,\r\nat the instance of any two members,) to formally state, and call for the\r\nvotes on, a question to be decided, and to declare the result of the same\r\nafter the vote has been taken.\r\n\r\nThis is the regular routine duty of a presiding officer. They, as\r\nthe recognized Heads of their respective Houses, have the general\r\noversight of its interests, and a general control of the conduct of its\r\nbusiness. They examine the Journal to see that it is correct, may order\r\nthe galleries and lobby to be cleared in case of any disturbance by\r\nspectators, and have general control over the unoccupied rooms in the\r\ncapitol belonging to their respective Houses. They are required to sign\r\nall acts, addresses, and joint resolutions, and appoint the members of\r\nall committees whose appointment is not specially directed by the House\r\nto be otherwise made. In all cases of ballot the Speaker of the House\r\nmust vote; but he is not required to vote in other cases unless there is\r\na tie, (an equal number for and against,) when he must give the casting\r\nvote. The President of the Senate may vote only in case of a tie.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Representatives goes into Committee of the Whole, the\r\nSpeaker leaves the chair, but appoints a chairman to preside for the time\r\nbeing; and when the President of the United States is impeached before\r\nthe Senate the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides.\r\n\r\n4. Their duties are very distinctly defined in the rules adopted by each\r\nHouse for their guidance, but many opportunities for exerting great\r\ninfluence often arise, and many cases requiring great tact and judgment\r\nand an intimate knowledge of Parliamentary Law. They receive a much\r\nlarger salary than ordinary Members of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of all the Speakers of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. A list of Vice-Presidents is given in the chapter\r\ndevoted to that officer.\r\n\r\n  Frederick A.

The Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives,\r\nare the officers next in rank in the two bodies forming Congress.\r\nThey are appointed by vote of their respective Houses. They are not\r\nnecessarily selected from among the members of the Senate or House, as is\r\nthe custom in case of the presiding officers, but may be chosen by the\r\nmembers at will.\r\n\r\n2. Their chief duties are in connection with a record or journal of\r\nthe proceedings of their respective Houses. This is an official and\r\ncorrect account of all the transactions of each body, is examined by\r\nthe presiding officer, and read before the members for criticism and\r\napproval. They cause this journal to be printed and a copy be delivered\r\nto each member at the commencement of every session of Congress, as also\r\nto the Executive and to each branch of the Legislature of every State.\r\nSo also they arrange, cause to be printed, and distribute to the members\r\nall the current documents of each House that may be useful to them in the\r\ndischarge of their duties, as often as the case requires. All contracts\r\nfor furnishing anything required by Congress, or for any labor done for\r\nit, are made with, or approved by, the Clerk of the House and Secretary\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\n3. They act also as treasurers of the special, or contingent funds\r\nof Congress, from which payments are made on their order, after the\r\naccounts, on which the order is based, are approved by the Committee of\r\nAccounts; and give bonds in a large sum for the faithful use of these\r\nfunds, making a detailed report of all expenditures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS\r\n\r\n4. Is a kind of police and executive officer, who aids or acts under the\r\ndirection of the presiding officer in keeping order, and executes the\r\ncommands of Congress. All arrests ordered by Congress are made by him or\r\nhis deputies, and all legal processes served by him. He bears a mace as\r\nthe symbol of his office when on duty. He keeps the accounts of the pay\r\nand mileage of the members of Congress, prepares checks, and draws and\r\npays the money to them.\r\n\r\n5. The other officers are a Doorkeeper—whose business it is to see that\r\nonly the proper persons gain admission to the sessions of Congress,\r\nand watches over, and is responsible for, the furniture contained in\r\nthe rooms of the capitol placed in his charge—and a postmaster, whose\r\nbusiness it is to superintend a postoffice kept in the capitol for the\r\naccommodation of members of Congress. Various clerks, deputies, and\r\nmessengers are employed under most of these officers, to aid them in the\r\ndischarge of their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nCONGRESS AT WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Congress is required by the Constitution to assemble on the first\r\nMonday in December of each year. It may, by a law duly made to that\r\neffect, change that time, but no permanent change has ever been made. As\r\nsoon after that time as a quorum of its members, which the Constitution\r\ndeclares shall be a majority of each House, has assembled each House\r\nproceeds to the election of officers (which, however, is done only every\r\nother year,) and the arrangement of its committees, and it is ready for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n2. As soon as the organization is ascertained to be complete the other\r\nHouse of Congress and the President are informed of the fact, after which\r\npropositions, or bills as they are called, of new laws, or repeals or\r\nrevisals of old ones are entertained. Of these there is never any lack.\r\nThey are taken up in regular order, referred to an appropriate committee\r\nfor examination, a report is in due time made by the committee, discussed\r\nat such length as the members see cause for, in a regular manner, and\r\nfinally are voted on. Sometimes, if the members are not satisfied with\r\nthe information presented on some point or points, they return them to\r\nthe committee with instructions to investigate further, and make another\r\nreport; sometimes they “lay them on the table,” that is, put them aside\r\nfor future action; or they accept, amend, or change them to meet their\r\nviews, and then accept or reject them altogether.\r\n\r\n3. When a bill has reached a vote and been accepted by the House in\r\nwhich it originated, it is sent to the other House, by which it is taken\r\nup, referred to a committee, usually passing through substantially the\r\nsame course and form of consideration as in the first case, laid aside,\r\namended, accepted or rejected according to circumstances, and returned\r\nto the former House. If it is accepted by both they then send it to the\r\nPresident, who carefully considers it. If it meets his approbation, he\r\nsigns and returns it to Congress, and it becomes the Law of the Land,\r\nand all to whom it refers are bound to obey it, it being the duty of the\r\nPresident to see that it is enforced. It is called an “Act of Congress,”\r\nbecause it is the proper exercise of its law making authority, and\r\nbecause all such laws are preceded by the clause, “Be it enacted by the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in\r\nCongress assembled.”\r\n\r\n4. If the President does not think it a suitable law, and is unwilling\r\nto assume the responsibility of signing it, he returns it to Congress,\r\nwith his reasons for not doing so. If Congress is not satisfied with\r\nthese reasons it may take another vote on it, and if the members in its\r\nfavor amount to two-thirds of each House, it becomes a law without the\r\nsignature of the President. This power of the President to decline to\r\nsign a law of Congress is called his “Veto.” Sometimes it is carried over\r\nthe veto, and sometimes it fails for lack of the requisite number in its\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n5. The larger part of Congressional laws are passed in this way, which is\r\nthe regular Parliamentary form; but sometimes its authority is expressed\r\nby a Resolution instead of a bill. This is a kind of informal way of\r\npassing a law, though it usually takes that form because of the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the subject of the Resolution; as an amendment to the\r\nConstitution would be commenced by a resolution passed by both Houses;\r\nbut, as Congress has not the sole power over that question, it requiring\r\nthe concurrence of three fourths of the States, it is put in that form.\r\nWhen some demand is to be made by Congress on the President, or on\r\nvarious officers of the government, and in a variety of other cases, a\r\nresolution has the force of law, disobedience to which would involve a\r\npenalty. Many resolutions merely express the views of Congress, and are\r\nof force and value only on account of the respectability and dignity of\r\nthe body expressing them. Some resolutions require to be passed in both\r\nHouses to acquire legal force, and are then called Concurrent Resolutions.\r\n\r\nA bill must pass through the regular forms of printing, reference to a\r\ncommittee, report, placing in order on the records, and calling up at a\r\nproper time for consideration and decision. This is very proper to avoid\r\nhasty action before all the bearings of the case have been examined;\r\nbut would consume too much time if required in every case. A resolution\r\nmay be debated and decided at once, and it facilitates the progress of\r\nbusiness, in the class of cases to which it is applicable.\r\n\r\n6. The amount of business to be done by Congress is immense. Each\r\nbranch of the executive department makes a yearly report to it, which\r\nmust be considered and suitable laws passed; many hundreds of laws are\r\ncommonly asked to be passed, repealed, or revised, by the President or\r\nthe people; and all the interests of a great and growing country looked\r\nafter. Those who are at a distance cannot always judge accurately of the\r\ndifficulties it meets with in endeavoring to give satisfaction to all,\r\nnor of the different appearance which questions may present when closely\r\nexamined and looked at on all sides, and Congress has a great deal of\r\nshort-sighted criticism to bear.\r\n\r\nCongressmen cannot always tell what is best more than other people, nor\r\nalways find themselves able to do what they prefer, or judge to be best,\r\nand the account to which they are held is sometimes unjust; yet, on the\r\nwhole they have always respected, and sought to serve, the views and\r\ninterests of the people as a whole, and deserve much praise. The country\r\nhas become prosperous and free under their legislation, and what the\r\nmajority of the people clearly call for is always done for them.\r\n\r\n7. The more carefully the people whom they represent watch them at work,\r\nand study the subjects they are required to legislate on, the less reason\r\nwill they find for denunciation of them, and the more intelligently\r\nwill they be able to lay out their work for them. They are the servants\r\nof the people, notwithstanding they seem to command and order, and are\r\nliable to be dismissed and turned out of place if they do not give\r\nsatisfaction. They are men like ourselves, with interests, temptations,\r\nand weaknesses. We should aid them in their work, and assist them to walk\r\nuprightly by our intelligence and careful regard for reason and right.\r\nOur representatives will always, in character and conduct, present a\r\nfair statement of what we are ourselves. If we are just, honest, and\r\nhigh-minded they will not dare to be otherwise than faithful and true,\r\nand if we are intelligent we shall never put ignorant and vile men in\r\noffice. So the Congress of the United States of America will always be a\r\ntruly Representative Body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC PRINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Among the Institutions of the government is that heading this chapter.\r\nThe amount of printing required to be done for Congress, the various\r\nbranches of the government, and for the benefit of the people, is very\r\ngreat indeed. All the proceedings of both Houses of Congress as recorded\r\nby the secretaries are required to be printed under authority; since many\r\ncopies are required by the members and for general purposes. All the\r\nlaws are printed in great numbers for circulation among the many millions\r\ninterested; and when a bill is proposed it requires to be printed for the\r\nuse of the several hundred members who need it for examination and study,\r\nalthough it often never becomes a law.\r\n\r\n2. The President’s Messages, and all the reports of heads of departments\r\nand bureaus; the reports and commissions of army and navy officers,\r\nof investigating committees, of various superintendents, agents, and\r\ngovernment employees, and many other things are printed, sometimes\r\nonly for use of Congress; sometimes for extensive circulation. Thus it\r\nis easily seen that the government printing is a heavy expense, and a\r\nvery large part is indispensable; though many believe that a judicious\r\nselection of documents and a careful study as to the number of some of\r\nthem printed might largely reduce the expense, without injury to the\r\npublic welfare. We do not wish to pay for the printing of documents that\r\nare never read. It is a waste of the people’s money; yet, we must not\r\nforget that it is of the utmost importance that the people should become\r\nintimately acquainted with all the affairs of the government. Perhaps\r\nCongress is sometimes wiser than the people, and that many documents\r\nare wisely printed, and unwisely left unread by those most interested.\r\nEconomy and intelligence are to be equally regarded.\r\n\r\n3. Until 1860, the government hired men to do this work, and a printer\r\nwas employed by each house of Congress. But great complaints were made\r\nof the enormous expense to which the country was subjected in this item\r\nof its expenditures; and at the date named, Congress passed an act\r\nestablishing a government printing office, to be under the direction of a\r\nsuperintendent of public printing. The sum of $150,000 was appropriated\r\nfor the purchase of necessary buildings, machinery, and materials for the\r\npurpose. By the provisions of the act it was made the superintendent’s\r\nduty to overlook all the public printing and binding, not only of\r\nCongress, but of all the departments, and of the United States courts; to\r\npurchase all necessary materials and to employ all the workmen required.\r\nAnd that Congress may know how the establishment is conducted and at\r\nwhat expense, the superintendent is required to report to Congress at\r\nthe commencement of every session, the work done, the number of hands\r\nemployed, and the exact state and condition of the establishment. He is\r\nprohibited from paying more for work done in this office than is given\r\nfor the same services in private printing offices in Washington.\r\n\r\n4. The superintendent is also charged with the duty of procuring all\r\nblank books, maps, drawings, diagrams, views, and charts, which may be\r\nordered by Congress, or by the heads of departments and bureaus. But the\r\nsuperintendent himself is not left to act always as he may think proper,\r\nfor in many cases he must have the approval of the joint committee on\r\nprinting of both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\n5. This is a very proper effort to curtail expenses. It remains to be\r\nseen how successful it may be. The constant watchful oversight of the\r\nSovereign People can alone succeed in keeping all things in due order.\r\nWhen the representatives of the people become careless and wasteful the\r\nadmonition of the people is never without its effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SIGNAL SERVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The present organization of this institution dates from the beginning\r\nof the civil war, and was originally purely military in its aims and\r\npurposes. It is still conducted by the War Department, and partly for its\r\nown purposes; but its value to agricultural and commercial interests is\r\nconstantly becoming more apparent and more extensive, and will probably,\r\nin the end, so overshadow its military relations as to reduce them to\r\na very subordinate place in importance. The civil uses of this service\r\nare based on the science of meteorology, which is largely occupied with\r\nweather changes, the origin, progress, and laws of Storms. Its value to\r\nthe people consists in its accurate prediction of changes in the weather,\r\nand the warning it is able to give, sometimes many hours or even days\r\nin advance, of dangerous storms. Its estimate of weather probabilities,\r\nbased on observations reported daily from prominent points covering the\r\nwhole country, are published in all the daily papers, usually found\r\naccurate, and are of great value to certain classes of the people. When a\r\nstorm threatens to endanger the safety of shipping a signal is displayed\r\nin the port to give warning, and much property and many lives are often\r\nsaved. It makes an accurate and scientific study of the weather and all\r\nthe laws controlling its changes, by a large corps of enlightened and\r\ntrained observers, all whose facts, constantly reported, systematized,\r\nand studied by competent persons, are likely to produce, in time, a most\r\nimportant and useful body of knowledge on that subject.\r\n\r\n2. The objects of the Signal Service require its officials to be\r\nconnected with the United States army, to have the use of the Electric\r\nTelegraph, to be familiar with Meteorology, and skillful in the use of\r\nthe scientific instruments employed in the study of atmospheric changes.\r\nBy means of the telegraph, the army, though scattered over the whole\r\ncountry, and especially the frontiers and more inaccessible parts, may be\r\nalmost instantaneously, and all at the same time, communicated with. It\r\nwould be possible, by telegraphs, signals, and railroads, to concentrate\r\nthe whole army from the numerous points where its fragments are located,\r\nfrom Maine to Texas, and the Atlantic to the Pacific, at one point in as\r\nshort a time as it formerly took a body of soldiers to march a hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n3. It is a singularly striking instance of the vigor and effectiveness of\r\ncontrol supplied by science, invention, and modern progress, by which our\r\nvast increase in numbers and in extent of territory are neutralized, the\r\ninterests, sentiments, and habits of the people unified so that sectional\r\njealousies and contests are made rare and slight, and the people of\r\nremote parts of the country made practically better acquainted with each\r\nother than formerly were the inhabitants of adjoining States.\r\n\r\n4. Subordination and thoroughness of system are secured by its connection\r\nwith the army, which probably also secures its advantages to the\r\ncountry at much less cost than would be the case were it an independent\r\ninstitution. The army is ambitious to be as useful as possible to the\r\ncountry. There is a Signal School of Instruction and Practice at Fort\r\nWhipple, in Va., which is to this Service what the Military and Naval\r\nAcademies are to the Army and Navy. The most suitable persons are\r\nselected from the army or especially enlisted, and carefully schooled and\r\ntested through a sufficiently long period to render them fully competent\r\nfor the delicate duties imposed on them.\r\n\r\n5. There are about 90 Signal Stations, a few being located in Canada and\r\nthe West Indies. The whole is under the direction of the Chief Signal\r\nOfficer, who reports to the Secretary of War. There is a large and\r\ncarefully arranged organization, under constant supervision by competent\r\npersons. Several Boards of Examination are employed in selecting suitable\r\npersons for the different duties required in the Service, and in testing\r\ntheir advancement toward a thorough fitness for each position to be\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nThe first or lowest grade is for the “field” signal service, requiring\r\na knowledge of army signals and telegraphy—this being the original\r\nmilitary value of the institution—the second grade includes those who\r\nare competent to act as assistants to observers in the scientific\r\nor meteorological part of the work; and the third (called Observer\r\nSergeants) includes those who have so complete a knowledge of the\r\nscientific principles involved and of the use of the instruments employed\r\nas to be fitted to take charge of Stations of Observation, and make the\r\nconstant and minute reports on which the conclusions of the Central\r\nOffice are based.\r\n\r\nThe Stations are from time to time inspected, and the whole system kept\r\nin the most accurate order. Very much depends on the intelligence and\r\nunremitting attention of the Observers.\r\n\r\nThis is, probably, the beginning of a work of the greatest practical\r\nvalue to commerce and agriculture. It will continually expand and grow\r\nmore exact and useful, and from its relations to the diffusion of\r\nimportant and useful knowledge we have placed it with\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n1. Though there are no doubt many minor failures to meet the wishes,\r\nand secure the interests of the people and some, perhaps, that are\r\nreally serious—though in these the people bear a good share of the\r\nblame—the government has pursued an enlightened policy in respect to the\r\nencouragement of Science, and the diffusion of useful knowledge. What it\r\ncan properly do in the interest of the whole people has been done. The\r\nSmithsonian Institution is not wholly a government establishment; but\r\nthe official machinery by which it was at first set in motion, and is\r\ncontinued in operation, belongs to the government. The funds with which\r\nit was founded, were furnished by an individual, and he a foreigner.\r\nThe history runs thus: A noble-hearted Englishman, whose name was John\r\nSmithson, residing in the city of London, bequeathed all his property to\r\nthe United States of America, for the purpose of founding in Washington\r\nan establishment to be known as the “Smithsonian Institution,” for the\r\npurpose of increasing and diffusing knowledge among men. The United\r\nStates accepted the bequest, and in 1846 passed an act for the purpose\r\nof carrying out the beneficent design of Mr. Smithson. This act created\r\n“an establishment,” as it is denominated in the act, by the name before\r\nstated. It might have been called a corporation, for it has perpetual\r\nsuccession, and many of the powers incident to a corporation.\r\n\r\n2. By this act the President and Vice-President of the United States, the\r\nSecretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War,\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster General, the Attorney General,\r\nand Chief Justice, the Commissioner of the Patent Office, and the Mayor\r\nof Washington—during the time they shall hold their respective offices,\r\ntogether with such other persons as they may elect honorary members—were\r\nconstituted the establishment under the name of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\n3. It is located at Washington, and is managed by a board of regents,\r\ncomposed of the Vice-President of the United States, the Chief Justice\r\nof the United States, the Mayor of Washington, three members of the\r\nSenate, and three members of the House of Representatives; together with\r\nsix other persons. The board choose their own officers, and report their\r\nproceedings to Congress at each session thereof.\r\n\r\n4. In order to carry out Mr. Smithson’s noble design of founding this\r\ninstitution, rooms have been prepared for the reception of all objects\r\nof art, natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical\r\nspecimens which now or hereafter may belong to the United States, and\r\nsuch as may hereafter be obtained. These are classified and arranged\r\nso as to facilitate their examination and study. A vast collection\r\nhas already been obtained and deposited in the institution, and it is\r\nconstantly increasing by donations, by the researches and industry of its\r\nprofessors, and by exchanges made with kindred institutions at home and\r\nabroad. These are open to the examination of the public, and offer an\r\nopportunity to students and others to extend their scientific knowledge.\r\nThis, together with the reports of its professors, of experiments and\r\nnew discoveries, make it indeed an institution “for the increase and\r\ndiffusion of knowledge among men.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nREPORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Congress being the law-making power of the government, it is evident\r\nthat, to know precisely what laws it is important to enact, to change,\r\nor to repeal, they should be kept well informed of all that is done\r\nby government officials, and the precise condition of every branch of\r\nthe public service. The President’s Messages are of the nature of\r\nreports made by the Chief Executive to the legislative body for its\r\ninformation and guidance. So it is enacted that the Secretaries of State,\r\nTreasury, War, Navy, Interior, and Postmaster General, together with the\r\ncommissioners of the different bureaus, and boards attached to these\r\ndepartments, shall annually report to Congress. Heads of departments\r\nreport directly to Congress. So do many of the commissioners who are at\r\nthe head of bureaus. Boards report to the heads of departments to which\r\nthey are attached.\r\n\r\n2. In this way Congress is kept advised of whatever is done in every\r\ndepartment, bureau, or board, to which any of the public business is\r\nentrusted. These reports not only furnish the law-making power with such\r\ninformation as it needs, but serve as a check to any official misconduct.\r\nThe annual reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and Navy,\r\ntogether with that of the Postmaster General, are State papers which rank\r\nin importance next to the annual message of the President. To them the\r\npeople look for a detailed account of the state and condition of those\r\ngreat departments over which these Secretaries preside, and which so\r\nmaterially affect the pecuniary and other great interests of the nation.\r\n\r\n3. The foregoing remarks upon reports, throw light upon the movements of\r\nthe machinery by which the government is operated, and show how officials\r\nare held responsible to the superior power.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may notice another kind of reports, which come\r\nfrom another source. After each Congress has convened and organized, the\r\nPresident of the Senate and the Speaker of the House appoint what are\r\ndenominated the standing committees of each of these bodies.\r\n\r\nWhen bills are presented to be passed into laws, or petitions are sent\r\nin, they are always referred to the appropriate committee, which examines\r\nthem and reports to the body (of the Senate or House) their conclusions\r\nupon the merits or demerits, propriety or impropriety, of granting the\r\npetition, or of passing the bill under consideration.\r\n\r\nThese reports generally govern the action of Congress when they come to\r\nvote upon the passage of the law. But that is not always the case; the\r\nbody of either House may think differently from its committee, and act\r\ncontrary to its recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the second article, section four, of the Constitution, these words\r\nare found: “The President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of\r\nthe United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and\r\nconviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\r\n\r\n2. Impeachment is a procedure against office holders only, for the\r\npurpose of removing them from office. It inflicts no other punishment;\r\nbut the guilty party may afterwards be prosecuted for his crime in a\r\ncourt of law, and punished in such manner as the law directs.\r\n\r\n3. The House of Representatives alone can present charges looking to the\r\ntrial of an officer of the government by impeachment. Its action, in such\r\na case, is similar to that of a Grand Jury. It charges that the official\r\nhas violated the law and should be tried, in order, if guilty, to be\r\nremoved from office. It appoints a committee to conduct the prosecution\r\nbefore the Senate, to which these charges are presented.\r\n\r\n4. The Senate alone has the power to try the accused party. When trying\r\na case of impeachment it acts as a court, and from its decision there is\r\nno appeal. The President cannot pardon a criminal who has been impeached.\r\nWhen the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court presides, but in no other case. No person can be\r\nconvicted in a trial of impeachment, unless two-thirds of the Senate\r\nconcur in finding the accused guilty of the alleged offense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the third Branch of the government, as determined by the\r\nConstitution, and is of supreme importance and dignity. Its sphere is to\r\ninterpret the Constitution, to decide controversies, to try offenders\r\nand to pronounce sentence on them, to enforce rights, and to keep the\r\nwhole organism of the government in proper place and proportion. It is\r\nattached to the governmental machinery as a Regulator. Without it the\r\nother Departments must be the judges of the extent of their own powers;\r\nthe Constitution would be practically inoperative to prevent inharmonious\r\nor mischievous legislation; and the executive would possess the authority\r\nto try as well as punish offenses.\r\n\r\nThe officers of this Department of the government are expected to be men\r\nof much weight and dignity of character, of wide legal culture, and are\r\nselected for, and continued in, office under such circumstances as to\r\nguarantee, to a fair extent, the requisite distinction and impartiality.\r\n\r\nAll this we shall see as we proceed to analyze its different branches.\r\nThese consist of the United States Supreme Court, the Circuit Courts,\r\nthe District Courts, and the Court of Claims. The local courts in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and the Territorial Courts, though similar to the\r\nState Judiciaries, are connected, by their relations to the General\r\nGovernment, with this Department.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this branch of the government has become more evident\r\nas time has passed, and the conflict of parties has put the whole to\r\ntest. The acrimonious party spirit of our early post revolutionary\r\nhistory, which continued into Monroe’s administration, was, in great\r\npart, the result of a want of due confidence in, and respect for, the\r\njudiciary. Experience showed that our people were law abiding, and that\r\nthe Legislative and Executive powers, equally with the people, were\r\nwilling to submit to the official interpretation of the Constitution, and\r\nall ready to join hands to maintain its authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This is the highest tribunal in the United States. If the whole\r\ngovernment be figuratively regarded as an arch this is the “Key Stone of\r\nthe Arch” without which the whole structure would crumble and fall. In\r\nall cases of dispute as to the meaning of the Constitution and the range\r\nof powers it confers, or implies, it has sovereign power to decide; and\r\nfrom that decision there is no appeal. Its declaration, as to the meaning\r\nand application of the Constitution and the body of statutes enacted\r\nunder it, becomes the law of the land. It is the great bulwark against\r\ntyrannical use of power, and conflicting enactments, whether by National\r\nor State Legislatures.\r\n\r\n2. This court has one Chief Justice and nine Associate Justices, all\r\nappointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate. They are appointed for life, or during good behavior; they may\r\nbe impeached for bribery or other high crimes, and then removed from\r\noffice. They may also resign; but if they conduct themselves properly and\r\nchoose to retain their offices, there is no power by which they can be\r\nremoved, except the power of death. The Constitution itself makes this\r\nprovision, in order that the judges may be removed as far as possible\r\nfrom the influence of party politics. It is therefore expected that their\r\ndecisions will not be biased by party or political considerations; and\r\nit may not be amiss to say that the provisions for keeping the judges of\r\nthe United States Courts in office for life, meets with almost universal\r\napprobation; and has caused many to hope that the States would alter\r\ntheir Constitutions and adopt the same plan; believing it to be the\r\nsurest way of preserving a pure and independent Judiciary, on which\r\ndepend the rights and liberties of every citizen of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n3. This court holds but one term in a year, which commences on the first\r\nMonday of December, and sits until it has disposed of the business before\r\nit. Its sessions are always held at Washington, the capital of the\r\nnation; there it has access to the Congressional and Law Libraries, and\r\nto all the departments and records of the government when necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of causes which may be commenced in this court. In these\r\ncases it has original jurisdiction. They are such as affect ambassadors,\r\nother public ministers, and consuls; and those in which a State shall be\r\na party. In other cases it has only appellate jurisdiction. The greater\r\npart of its business is to hear and determine appeals from inferior\r\ncourts, mainly from the United States Circuit Courts; and in some\r\ninstances from the highest State courts.\r\n\r\n4. It has not only original, but exclusive jurisdiction in causes where a\r\nState is a party, and when proceedings or suits against ambassadors, or\r\nother public ministers or their servants, are instituted. Its power to\r\ntry appeals from lower courts, called _appellate_ jurisdiction, gives it\r\nthe position of the highest court in the nation.\r\n\r\nIt has power also to restrain or to prohibit proceedings in the United\r\nStates District Courts, when acting as courts of Admiralty; or in cases\r\nof maritime jurisdiction. The judges of this court hold the Circuit\r\nCourts, and allot themselves among the judicial circuits.\r\n\r\nThe practice and rules of procedure in this court are very similar to\r\nthose of the Courts of Chancery and King’s Bench, in England. Issues of\r\nfact are tried by jury, the same as in other courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS OF THE COURT.\r\n\r\n5. The officers of this tribunal are the Judges, the Attorney General,\r\na clerk, a crier, and a reporter. The three last named are appointed by\r\nthe court. It is the duty of the Marshal of the District of Columbia to\r\nattend this court, and to serve process issuing from it.\r\n\r\nAn Attorney or Counsellor-at-Law, to be admitted to practice in this\r\ncourt, must have been a practitioner in the Supreme Court of the State\r\nwhere he lives.\r\n\r\n6. The following are the names of all the Chief Justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, from its establishment to the present time;\r\nwith the dates of their appointments, and the States from which they were\r\nappointed:\r\n\r\n  John Jay, N. Y., Sept. 26, 1789.\r\n  John Rutledge, S. C., July 1, 1795.\r\n  William Cushing, Mass., Jan. 27, 1796.\r\n  Oliver Ellsworth, Ct., March 4, 1796.\r\n  John Jay, N. Y., Dec. 19, 1800.\r\n  John Marshall, Va., Jan. 27, 1801.\r\n  Roger B. Taney, Md., Dec. 28, 1835.\r\n  Salmon P. Chase, O., Dec. 1864.\r\n  Morrison R. Waite, O., Jan. 21, 1874.\r\n\r\n7. The following are the names of the Associate Justices with the dates\r\nof their appointment and the States from which they were appointed:\r\n\r\n  John Rutledge, S. C., 1789.\r\n  William Cushing, Mass., 1789.\r\n  Robert H. Harrison, Md., 1789.\r\n  James Wilson, Pa., 1789.\r\n  John Blair, Va., 1789.\r\n  James Iredell, N. C., 1790.\r\n  Thomas Johnson, Md., 1791.\r\n  William Paterson, N. J., 1793.\r\n  Samuel Chase, Md., 1796.\r\n  Bushrod Washington, Va., 1798.\r\n  Alfred Moore, N. C., 1799.\r\n  William Johnson, S. C., 1804.\r\n  Brockholst Livingston, N. Y., 1807.\r\n  Thomas Todd, Va., 1807.\r\n  Gabriel Duvall, Md., 1811.\r\n  Joseph Story, Mass., 1811.\r\n  Smith Thompson, N. Y., 1823.\r\n  Robert Trimble, Ky., 1823.\r\n  John McLean, O., 1829.\r\n  Henry Baldwin, Pa., 1830.\r\n  James M. Wayne, Ga., 1835.\r\n  Philip P. Barbour, Va., 1836.\r\n  John McKinley, Ala., 1837.\r\n  John Catron, Tenn., 1837.\r\n  Peter V. Daniel, Va., 1841.\r\n  Samuel Nelson, N. Y., 1845.\r\n  Levi Woodbury, N. H., 1845.\r\n  Robert C. Grier, Pa., 1846.\r\n  Benjamin R. Curtis, Mass., 1851.\r\n  James A. Campbell, Ala., 1853.\r\n  Nathan Clifford, Me., 1858.\r\n  Noah H. Swayne, O., 1862.\r\n  Samuel F. Miller, Iowa, 1862.\r\n  Stephen J. Field, Cal.\r\n  David Davis, Ill., 1862.\r\n  William Strong, Pa., 1870.\r\n  Joseph P. Bradley, N. J., 1870.\r\n  Ward Hunt, N. Y., 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nCIRCUIT COURTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next in dignity, power, and jurisdiction are the United States\r\nCircuit Courts. While the Supreme Court is always held in Washington,\r\nthese are held in every State at such times and places as special law\r\nof Congress directs. These are often changed so as to accommodate both\r\nthe people in the States and the judges of the Court. As now arranged,\r\nthe whole Union is divided into nine circuits, each circuit comprising\r\nseveral States, according to the size and population of the States. The\r\nplaces are arranged with reference to convenience of access by all the\r\npeople in the circuit.\r\n\r\nThis Court is similar in design and authority to the Supreme Court;\r\nindeed it is but a branch of it; the same officers presiding, and the\r\nsame class of questions being adjudicated by it, viz.: those involving\r\nConstitutional Law; and this authority, so important to uniformity of\r\ninterpretation of constitutional provisions, and to the enjoyment of\r\nrights guaranteed by that instrument to citizens of all the States, is\r\nmade pervading—is carried within the reach of all.\r\n\r\n2. The Circuit Courts are held by the Judges of the Supreme Court, who\r\nallot the circuits among themselves, and then travel each through his own\r\ncircuit, until he has visited and held a session in every State which\r\nlies within it. A Judge of the Supreme Court is the presiding and supreme\r\nmagistrate in every Circuit Court, but the Judge of the District Court\r\nof the district in which the Circuit is held, sits with the Judge of the\r\nSupreme Court, as Associate Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nJURISDICTION.\r\n\r\n3. These Courts have both original and appellate jurisdiction. Causes\r\nmay be appealed from the District Courts to the Circuit. They also have\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction with the State courts, where the matter in\r\ndispute exceeds the sum of $500, and the United States are plaintiffs;\r\nor where an alien is a party, or where the suit is between citizens of\r\ndifferent States. They have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases of crimes\r\nagainst the United States, except where the law especially confers the\r\npower on other courts. It extends to all cases under the revenue laws of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n4. There is also a certain class of cases (too tedious to be described\r\nhere in detail,) which may be removed from State and from District\r\nCourts, into these courts, and be tried and determined in the same manner\r\nas if they had been commenced here.\r\n\r\nThe officers of Circuit Courts are, first, the Judges; second, the\r\nDistrict Attorney of the district in which the court is held; third, the\r\nMarshal of the district; and fourth, a Clerk, who is appointed by the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n5. It may be interesting, and perhaps useful to know how the different\r\ncircuits are formed, and what States lie in each. They have been from\r\ntime to time increased in number, as the number of the States increased.\r\nIn some cases States have been at first placed in one circuit, and\r\nafterwards detached and placed in another.\r\n\r\n6. By the Acts of 1862 and 1863, the circuits were arranged as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst Circuit—Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire (by\r\nAct of 1820).\r\n\r\nSecond Circuit—Vermont, Connecticut, New York (Act of 1837).\r\n\r\nThird Circuit—New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFourth Circuit—Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and North Carolina.\r\n\r\nFifth Circuit—South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida.\r\n\r\nSixth Circuit—Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nSeventh Circuit—Ohio and Indiana.\r\n\r\nEighth Circuit—Michigan and Illinois.\r\n\r\nNinth Circuit—Wisconsin, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nTenth Circuit—California and Oregon.\r\n\r\nBut in 1866 this arrangement of the circuits was again changed; and\r\nthis was done, we suppose, to make the circuits approximate nearer to\r\nthe number of Associate Justices, as reduced from nine to six by the\r\nsame act; for, it was then enacted that hereafter there should be no\r\nmore Associate Justices of the Supreme Court appointed, until they were\r\nreduced (by death or resignation), to six.\r\n\r\n7. The circuits by this last act were reduced to nine, and were arranged\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nFirst and Second Circuits to remain as before.\r\n\r\nThe Third was made up of the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and\r\nDelaware.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth, of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth, of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth, of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh, of Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth, of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThe Ninth, of California, Oregon and Nevada.\r\n\r\nWe have inserted both of these circuit arrangements, because one new\r\nState (Nebraska), has been admitted since the act passed. Others will\r\nsoon come in, and very probably the old number of circuits and judges\r\nwill be restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT COURTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We come now to the lowest grade of United States courts, excepting the\r\nlocal courts in the District of Columbia, and the Territorial Courts.\r\nA United States District Court is held by a District Judge in every\r\ndistrict. Every State constitutes at least one district, several of the\r\nlarger States are divided into two, and some into three. There are at\r\nthe present time fifty-nine Judicial Districts, and consequently the\r\nsame number of District Judges, District Attorneys, District Clerks and\r\nMarshals. The Judges, Attorneys and Marshals are all appointed by the\r\nPresident and Senate; the Clerks by the respective courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS.\r\n\r\n2. By the law of 1789 every District Judge was required to hold four\r\nsessions a year, at such times and in such places as Congress directed.\r\nThis is done to this day in a great majority of the States; but by later\r\nlaws, in some of the districts only two or three sessions a year are\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\nJURISDICTION.\r\n\r\n3. These courts have exclusive jurisdiction in all admiralty and maritime\r\ncauses. These relate to maritime contracts, and to crimes against the\r\nlaws of the United States, committed on the sea and on navigable lakes\r\nand rivers. It embraces in this country all contracts respecting vessels\r\nand navigation; such as chartering, repairing, and fitting them out,\r\nseamen’s wages, &c. They have in some cases concurrent jurisdiction with\r\nthe Circuit Courts, as in cases of piracy, and exclusive cognizance of\r\ncases where seizures are made for a violation of the revenue laws, or\r\nlaws relating to imports and navigation; and causes against consuls and\r\nvice consuls where the amount claimed does not exceed $100. In short,\r\nthey have concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Courts, of all crimes\r\nagainst the laws of the United States, the punishment of which is not\r\ncapital. The trial of issues of fact in all causes except civil causes of\r\nadmiralty and maritime jurisdiction, must be by jury.\r\n\r\n4. Appeals are taken from these courts to the Circuit Courts. The judges\r\nare appointed like those of the Supreme Court, for life, or during good\r\nbehavior, and receive various amounts as salary, some more and some less,\r\naccording to the amount of services to be performed in their respective\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n5. When vessels are captured in time of war, either by the public armed\r\nvessels or by private armed ships, the facts and circumstances of the\r\ncapture must be brought before a United States Circuit or District\r\nCourt for adjudication; when the vessel and cargo are either condemned\r\nas a prize, or restored to their owners. When either of these courts\r\nadjudicate such cases, it is called a Prize Court.\r\n\r\nWe give the number of Judicial Districts in each State as they now exist,\r\nand the total number in all the States. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Alabama, 3.\r\n  Arkansas, 2.\r\n  California, 2.\r\n  Connecticut, 1.\r\n  Mississippi, 2.\r\n  Missouri, 2.\r\n  Nevada, 1.\r\n  New Hampshire, 1.\r\n  Delaware, 1.\r\n  Florida, 2.\r\n  Georgia, 2.\r\n  Illinois, 2.\r\n  Indiana, 1.\r\n  Iowa, 1.\r\n  Kansas, 1.\r\n  Kentucky, 1.\r\n  Louisiana, 2.\r\n  Maine, 1.\r\n  Maryland, 1.\r\n  Massachusetts, 1.\r\n  Michigan, 2.\r\n  Minnesota, 1.\r\n  District of Columbia, 1.\r\n  New Jersey, 1.\r\n  New York, 3.\r\n  North Carolina, 3.\r\n  Nebraska, 1.\r\n  Ohio, 2.\r\n  Oregon, 1.\r\n  Pennsylvania, 2.\r\n  Rhode Island, 1.\r\n  South Carolina, 2.\r\n  Tennessee, 3.\r\n  Texas, 2.\r\n  Vermont, 1.\r\n  Virginia, 1.\r\n  West Virginia, 1.\r\n  Wisconsin, 1.\r\n\r\n  Total, 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY AND MARITIME JURISDICTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient times—and long before this government existed—civilized\r\nand commercial nations had codes or laws which related especially to\r\ntransactions upon the sea. Those respecting ships of war and warlike\r\noperations at sea were called the laws of Admiralty; those respecting\r\nvessels engaged in commercial affairs were called Maritime laws; and the\r\ncourts empowered with jurisdiction to hear and try causes, or to take\r\nany judicial proceedings in those cases, were styled Courts of Admiralty\r\nand Maritime Jurisdiction. These laws, in many respects, differed so\r\nmaterially from the laws relating to affairs on land, that the authority\r\nand power to take proceedings in and adjudicate upon them was conferred\r\nupon a particular class of courts. Hence we see the origin of the names\r\nof such tribunals.\r\n\r\nIn this country the United States District Courts have been designated\r\nby the laws as the courts which shall have original and exclusive\r\nauthority to adjudicate this class of causes; yet an appeal from the\r\nDistrict to the Circuit Courts may be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIND OF CASES.\r\n\r\nThe word Maritime designates that which relates to the sea. Yet, in\r\nthe United States, cases which come within Admiralty and Maritime\r\njurisdiction are not restricted to the sea, or to transactions relating\r\nto business or crimes done on it, but are made to embrace those which\r\noccur on navigable lakes and rivers, and include seizures made for the\r\nviolation of the laws of impost, navigation, or trade, suits for the\r\nrecovery of seamen’s wages, contracts for building, repairing or fitting\r\nout vessels, and, briefly, all contracts where the subject-matter relates\r\nto the navigation of the sea. The District Courts have Admiralty and\r\nMaritime jurisdiction in all these cases, without regard to the amount\r\nclaimed, and in criminal as well as in civil suits.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks show the workings of our judicial system, as it\r\napplies to business done, and crimes committed upon the high seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nCOURT OF CLAIMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This court was established by act of Congress in 1855. The law reads\r\nthus: “A court shall be established to be called the Court of Claims, to\r\nconsist of three judges, to be appointed by the President and Senate, and\r\nto hold their offices during good behavior; and the said court shall hear\r\nand determine all claims founded upon any law of Congress, or upon any\r\nregulation of an Executive department, or upon any contract express or\r\nimplied, with the government of the United States; which may be suggested\r\nto it by a petition filed therein; and also all claims which may be\r\nreferred to said court by either house of Congress.”\r\n\r\n2. On the third of March, 1863, the jurisdiction of this court was\r\nenlarged, and two additional judges appointed (making five), from the\r\nwhole number of which the President was authorized to appoint one a Chief\r\nJustice for said court.\r\n\r\n3. The mode of commencing proceeding before this tribunal is by petition;\r\nin which the claimant must fully set forth his claim, how it arose, its\r\namount, and the parties interested therein. After the case has been heard\r\nand determined, the court reports to Congress what its decision is, and\r\nif favorable to the claimant, a bill is passed for his relief.\r\n\r\n4. It holds one session a year, in Washington, commencing on the first\r\nMonday in October, and continuing as long as the business before it\r\nrequires. It not only tries claims against the government, but by its\r\nenlarged jurisdiction, conferred in 1863, it also tries counter claims\r\nand set-offs which the United States may have against the claimant.\r\nAppeals are taken from the Court of Claims to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, when the amount in controversy exceeds $3,000.\r\n\r\n5. Before the establishment of this court, the only remedy persons\r\nhaving claims upon the government had, was by petitioning to Congress\r\nfor relief; which experience proved to be a long, tedious, and expensive\r\nmode of obtaining their dues. The petition now goes to this court, where\r\nit is heard and adjudicated in the same form, and by the same rules of\r\nprocedure which are observed in other courts; for Congress has conferred\r\nupon it all the powers commonly possessed by other courts of law. It also\r\nhas a seal.\r\n\r\n6. It has greatly facilitated the settlement of claims against the\r\ngovernment, and has relieved Congress of a great amount of labor, which\r\nwas urgently pressed upon it at every session.\r\n\r\n7. In addition to the five judges, it has a Solicitor, an Assistant\r\nSolicitor, and a Deputy Solicitor, all of whom are appointed by the\r\nPresident and Senate; and are officers of the court, whose duty it is\r\nfaithfully to defend the United States in all matters and claims before\r\nthis court.\r\n\r\nA bailiff, a clerk, a crier and messenger, all of whom are appointed by\r\nthe court, make up the remaining officials.\r\n\r\nThe claimants stand in the relation of plaintiffs, and the government in\r\nthat of defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT ATTORNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese officers are next in rank to the Judges of the Circuit and District\r\nCourts with which their duties are connected. Their relation to the\r\ngovernment, in the class of cases that come before those courts, is the\r\nsame as that of the Attorney General in the Supreme Court. They are\r\nits official legal counselors in all cases involving the interests of\r\nthe General Government before the Circuit and District Courts in their\r\nseveral districts. They are appointed in the same manner; that is,\r\nnominated by the President, and confirmed by the Senate. It is their duty\r\n“to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences\r\ncognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil\r\nactions in which the United States shall be concerned.” They are his\r\nclients, and he must enforce their rights, and defend them, in the same\r\nmanner that any attorney protects and defends his client in any of the\r\nState courts. In case of necessity, he may appoint a substitute to act in\r\nhis place. All fees over and above what he is allowed as compensation for\r\nhis services, he must report and pay into the United States Treasury.\r\n\r\n3. He must defend collectors of the customs and other revenue officers\r\nin his district, when suits are brought against them in their official\r\ncapacity, and must report to the Solicitor of the Treasury the number of\r\nsuits determined and pending in his district. And when prize cases have\r\nbeen determined, or are pending in the District Court of his district, he\r\nmust report the state and condition of each case to the Secretary of the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nDistrict Attorneys are appointed for four years, but may be removed at\r\nthe pleasure of the President. Their compensation depends on the amount\r\nof business to be done in their respective districts. When important\r\nports of entry, such as New York or Boston, lie in their districts, their\r\nduties are very numerous, and they receive a corresponding compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES MARSHALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. United States Marshals are the ministerial officers of the United\r\nStates courts. Their duties and responsibilities are very similar, and\r\nnearly identical with the duties and responsibilities of sheriffs in the\r\ncourts of the several States. They are appointed by the President and\r\nSenate, for a term of four years. They appoint their own deputies, and\r\ntheir compensation consists of fees instead of a salary; and depends\r\nentirely upon the amount of business they have to transact. There is a\r\nMarshal in every Judicial District in the United States, and there are\r\nfifty-nine of these districts in all. Every State forms at least one\r\ndistrict, while the larger States are divided into two or three.\r\n\r\n2. A District Court is held in every district; and it is the Marshal’s\r\nduty to attend the sittings of these courts, and also those of the United\r\nStates Circuit Courts, when they happen to sit in his district. The\r\nMarshal for the District of Columbia must also attend the sittings of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and execute its precepts. We have said that they are\r\nthe ministerial officers of the United States courts; for it is their\r\nduty to serve all writs and precepts emanating from them, whether of a\r\ncivil or criminal character; and to execute the judgments and decrees of\r\nthese tribunals; and for this purpose they are authorized by law, (if\r\nnecessary,) to command such assistance as they may need in the execution\r\nof their duties. Before they enter upon the duties of their office, they\r\nmust be bound to the United States for the faithful performance of them,\r\nand must solemnly swear to do them, without malice or partiality; and\r\nthat they will take only lawful fees. They are also held answerable for\r\nthe delivery to their successors of all prisoners who may be in their\r\ncustody at the time of their removal, or at the expiration of their term\r\nof office.\r\n\r\n3. They also have the custody of all vessels and goods seized by any\r\nofficer of the revenue. It is their duty also to summon, and to pay\r\njurors and witnesses in behalf of any prisoner to be tried for a capital\r\noffense, under the laws of the United States. In the remarks made under\r\nthe head “Census,” we stated that it was made the duty of the Marshals to\r\nsuperintend and direct the enumeration of the people; and to collect such\r\nstatistical facts as the law requires. This they do through deputies,\r\nwhom they appoint for that special purpose.\r\n\r\nThe United States Marshal is also required, on the first day of January\r\nand July of each year, to make a return of all the fees and emoluments of\r\nhis office to the Secretary of the Interior; and if they amount to more\r\nthan $6,000 per year, he must pay the surplus into the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nGRAND JURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. By turning to the fifth article of the amendments to the Constitution,\r\nyou will find these words: “No person shall be held to answer for\r\na capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or\r\nindictment of a Grand Jury; except in cases arising in the land or naval\r\nforces, or in the militia, when in actual service, in time of war or\r\npublic danger.” This constitutional provision makes a Grand Jury a very\r\nimportant agent or instrumentality in the execution of the laws, and also\r\na safeguard of the liberties and rights of the people. It secures every\r\nperson from the expense and disgrace of a trial for infamous crimes,\r\nunless a Grand Jury of his countrymen shall find upon inquiry and\r\ninvestigation, that there are good reasons for believing that the person\r\nso charged has committed the alleged offense.\r\n\r\n2. This provision not only protects those who are charged with these\r\ncrimes against the laws of the United States, but those also who may be\r\ncharged with such offenses against the laws of any State; for no State\r\ncan arrest and try any person for a capital or infamous crime without\r\nthese preliminary proceedings of a Grand Jury; and should it do so, the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court would set its laws aside, as contrary to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. Here we see that the government is\r\njust as careful to protect its citizens from injustice by hasty judicial\r\nproceedings as it is to punish them after a fair and impartial trial.\r\n\r\n3. A Grand Jury, when called to take cognizance of violations of the laws\r\nof the United States, to find indictments against those who are charged\r\nwith them, is summoned by a judge of a United States court in the circuit\r\nor district where the alleged crime has been perpetrated; and it must\r\ntake notice of all crimes against the laws of the United States, which\r\nmay be brought to its knowledge, within the circuit or district in which\r\nit sits. Hence, if ordered by a Circuit Judge, its powers extend over all\r\nthose States which lie in that circuit. But when ordered by a District\r\nJudge, its powers extend only to that district in which it sits, and a\r\ndistrict never embraces more than one State, and in many cases a State is\r\ndivided into two or three districts.\r\n\r\n4. This shows us how much more extensive is the jurisdiction of a Grand\r\nJury, when acting under the laws of the United States, than when acting\r\nunder State laws. In the former it extends generally all over a State,\r\nand sometimes over several States. But in the latter it is confined to\r\nthe county in which it sits.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND AND PETIT JURIES.\r\n\r\nA Grand Jury never acts but in criminal cases. A Petit Jury acts in both\r\ncriminal and civil cases. The finding or conclusion arrived at by a\r\nGrand Jury is called a presentment, or an indictment. The finding of a\r\nPetit Jury is called its verdict.\r\n\r\n5. Second, a Grand Jury sits alone (not in the presence of the court),\r\nand deliberates upon such matters of a criminal character as it possesses\r\nknowledge of, or which may be brought to its notice by the court or by\r\nother persons; and when it finds that great evils exist, and wrongs have\r\nbeen perpetrated, it presents them to the court, and calls the attention\r\nof the law officers to them; which is equivalent to a recommendation that\r\njudicial proceedings should be commenced to abate the evil, or to punish\r\nthe wrong-doer. This is called a presentment of the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nAnd when they find, upon such evidence as they have, that a great crime\r\nhas been perpetrated, or that they have good reason so to believe, and\r\nthat it has been perpetrated by some person specified, they report their\r\nfinding or conclusion to the Court. This is called an indictment by the\r\nGrand Jury; after which the person so charged is arrested, if at large,\r\nand can be found, and is either imprisoned or held to bail for his\r\nappearance at court to stand trial.\r\n\r\n6. A Grand Jury never tries a case. It only says to the court by its\r\npresentment or indictment, that the case presented, or the person\r\nindicted, ought to be brought before the court, and tried for the alleged\r\nwrong or crime.\r\n\r\nA Petit Jury sits with the court, hears the pleadings and arguments of\r\ncounsel on both sides, listens to the evidence of witnesses; and then\r\nhears the charge of the judge, as to the law applicable to the case;\r\nafter which they withdraw and deliberate alone upon the case, and if they\r\nagree in a criminal case, their verdict is “Guilty,” or “Not Guilty;” if\r\nin a civil suit, they say how much one party is indebted (if any), to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n7. The object aimed at in that article of the Constitution which stands\r\nat the head of this chapter, is to protect persons from false charges\r\nof crime, and hasty adjudication of such charges; for it substantially\r\namounts to a declaration that no person shall be punished for a capital\r\nor infamous crime, unless one jury, before trial, shall, upon information\r\nand belief, charge him with the offense; and another, after trial, shall\r\nfind him guilty of the alleged crime.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks are as applicable to Grand and Petit Juries, acting\r\nunder State, as those which act under the United States laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nLOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Supreme power in the United States is lodged in the general\r\ngovernment, with its three branches: Legislative, Executive, and\r\nJudicial. The authority of this government, however, is restricted to\r\nthe powers expressly conferred on it by the Constitution; all other\r\npower being reserved to the States, or the people. The States also are\r\nsovereign in their own limits, over all questions not expressly assigned\r\nto the General Government. Instead of conflict of authority there is true\r\nharmony. The people elect the members of both the classes of legislators\r\nand executives, and both are equally employed in attending to the\r\ninterests of the people confided to their care; the first to General, the\r\nsecond to Local interests. All the members and officers of each are the\r\nservants of the Sovereign People.\r\n\r\n2. As soon as the general government was organized under the\r\nConstitution, there arose two parties. One wished to render the General\r\nGovernment prominent in order to secure concentration of strength and\r\nvigor of action; the other desired to exalt the State governments in\r\nthe fear that the general government might prove ambitious of too much\r\npower, and disregard the welfare of the people. As in almost all party\r\nplatforms, both these seemed to take too narrow a view. Washington was\r\nheld to sympathize more with the first, Jefferson was the acknowledged\r\nleader of the second. Together they secured a very fair mingling of\r\nboth these principles in the administration and general policy of the\r\ncountry. A strict adherence to the meaning and spirit of the Constitution\r\nwould not seem to give special favor to either, or allow a conflict of\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n3. The Supreme Court, or the Judiciary, is the regulating, or reconciling\r\nelement, which the Constitution set over the whole to see that no undue\r\nor improper action should defeat its purposes, and that no collisions of\r\nauthority should occur. Its decision is final, it being the last resort\r\nin cases of appeal; and, as the only final and authoritative interpreter\r\nof Constitutional Law, it may revise the action of all other branches of\r\nboth general and local government, and put them in harmony.\r\n\r\n4. It is plain that the authors of the Constitution intended to fuse\r\nthe separate elements, or States, into one whole, where general matters\r\nwere concerned; and to leave those elements perfectly free and absolute\r\ncontrol of all questions involving only their separate and local\r\nconcerns. The _People_, and their welfare, are the aim and end of both\r\norganizations. The possession of power for ambitious ends by general,\r\nState, or municipal organizations, or by individuals, was apparently as\r\nforeign to the thought of the whole Constitutional convention of 1787 as\r\nit seems always to have been to the mind of Washington. That great man\r\nwas the leader of clear-sighted and pure-minded statesmen, and whatever\r\nweaknesses and faults have existed at any time (and there have always\r\nbeen an abundance of them, as there were in the times of Washington)\r\namong political leaders, it must be allowed that the Fathers had worthy\r\nsons who knew how to work correctly the problems left them by their\r\npredecessors. A single question proved quite unmanageable to the sons, as\r\nit had before to the fathers, and had to be settled by an appeal to arms;\r\nbut it demonstrated the strength of the people and the ability of our\r\ninstitutions to withstand the severest shocks.\r\n\r\n5. The original States adopted the Constitution after deliberate study,\r\nand all the States since admitted virtually do the same. Their general\r\nstructure in their legislative, executive, and judicial arrangements\r\nis substantially the same as that of the General Government. The State\r\nLegislatures consist of two Houses, chosen in different ways, and for\r\ndifferent terms; the relations between them being similar to those of\r\nCongress. Every State has a governor, answering to the President of the\r\nUnited States, who is the executive officer of the State government. The\r\ncourts in all are organized on the same principle as the Supreme Court\r\nof the general government. Although there are small variations from the\r\nmodel, in various States, they do not affect the general resemblance;\r\nand, due allowance being made for the different subjects to be treated,\r\nthe analysis of the general, or of any of State governments, will give a\r\nsufficiently correct view of all.\r\n\r\n6. A State cannot make treaties with a foreign power, nor declare war\r\nagainst it. It cannot raise a revenue by duties on imports, nor control\r\nthe postal service, or matters involving the interests of other States.\r\nIt has therefore no Department for Foreign relations, its Secretary of\r\nState dealing only with State affairs. It has no Department of War, or\r\nNavy, and no Postmaster General. The Governor’s signature is necessary\r\nto the validity of laws passed by the two branches of the legislature,\r\nand in most of the States he has a veto power similar to that of the\r\nPresident. He has an executive council answering to the Cabinet. The\r\ncourts are more numerous than those of the general government, to meet\r\nthe wants of all classes of the people; ranging from a Supreme or\r\nConstitutional court, whose office it is to interpret and apply the\r\nconstitution of the State; through all grades, of Common Pleas, Circuit,\r\nDistrict, Police, and Recorder’s courts down to neighborhood courts\r\nheld by Justices of the Peace, or Aldermen. There are various others in\r\ndifferent States for special purposes.\r\n\r\n7. States are subdivided for purposes of local government into counties\r\nand towns; and these into smaller portions for educational and other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThus the whole is like an extensive system of machinery, wheel being\r\nfitted to wheel. From the lowest to the highest the people of each\r\nlocal division have entire control over the subjects in which they only\r\nare interested; and there is very little opportunity for the exercise\r\nof arbitrary power. Executive officers may be changed by election, or\r\nimpeachment, if they do not give satisfaction, or prove unfaithful; and\r\nas many securities as it is possible to devise are provided against\r\nabuses, or, if a majority in any State (or the United States) believe\r\nthat an improvement can be made, there are constitutional and legal\r\nmethods for securing it.\r\n\r\nThus our country is insured against serious discontents for which no\r\nremedy is at hand; and from the revolutions and internal disturbances\r\nthat interrupt the progress, and destroy the resources of so many other\r\ncountries. It is a government _of_, _for_, and _by_ the people. The\r\nvalue of any institution or office in the United States, from the school\r\ndistrict and director to State legislature, Congress, governor, or\r\nPresident, is determined by the relation it bears to the Public Welfare;\r\nand when it ceases to be useful there are, as there ought to be, legal\r\nmeans for laying it aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original thirteen States are here arranged in the order of size—the\r\none having the largest area being placed first. They are ranked according\r\nto their _present_ area, the claims of some of them at first extending to\r\nterritory since erected into States; and one, Virginia, has been divided.\r\nHer former area would have ranked her as first.\r\n\r\nThe States that follow are placed in the order of their admission into\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGEORGIA.\r\n\r\nThis State was the last settled of the original thirteen. It was founded\r\nin the benevolent anxiety of Gen. James Oglethorpe and others to relieve\r\nthe distresses of the poor in England. Those imprisoned for debt were\r\nsent out in large numbers. With this object was connected the desire\r\nto prevent the extension of the Spanish settlements in Florida, and\r\nthe English government favored the undertaking. This class of settlers\r\nproving indolent and improvident, a better was attracted by laying off\r\nmany towns, in the best locations, and offering fifty acres free to\r\nevery actual settler. Many Scotch and German emigrants improved this\r\nopportunity, to the great advantage of the colony.\r\n\r\nGen. Oglethorpe imitated the wise conduct of Penn, in his treaties with\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his settlement at Savannah, in 1733, cheerfully assisted by\r\nthe South Carolinians, who were pleased to see a barrier placed between\r\nthem and the Spaniards. Oglethorpe had several conflicts with them, and\r\nsucceeded in protecting his colony. The introduction of slaves was at\r\nfirst forbidden; but, as the colony seemed to fall behind the neighboring\r\nprovinces for want of laborers, the restriction was removed. In 1752 the\r\ncompany gave up their charter, and Georgia became a royal province. It\r\ntook part with the other colonies in resistance to the aggressions of the\r\nEnglish ministry, at the Revolutionary period, and its condition during\r\nthe war was similar to that of North and South Carolina. Being new, and\r\non the frontier, it was not conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of the State is uneven, the central and lower sections\r\nproductive under a wise and careful culture, but easily exhausted under\r\nbad management. She has long navigable rivers, and her manufacturing\r\nand commercial capabilities are excellent. The system of slave-labor\r\nand the misfortunes of the Civil War have embarrassed her progress, but\r\nthe energy of her people is fast raising her to her proper rank as a\r\nflourishing State.\r\n\r\nGeorgia has an area of 52,009 square miles, equal to 33,285,760 acres.\r\nShe was named after George II.\r\n\r\nThe population in 1870 was 1,200,000, which entitles her to nine\r\nRepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe State lies in the fifth judicial circuit, and has two judicial\r\ndistricts; also four ports of entry—Savannah, Brunswick, St. Mary’s, and\r\nHardwicke; and two ports of delivery—Augusta and Sunbury.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Atlanta. The State election is held on the first Tuesday\r\nin August. The Legislature meets on the second Wednesday in January.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of her laws is: “Be it enacted by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met;\r\nand it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  William Few,          from  1789  to  1793.\r\n  James Gunn,             ”   1789   ”  1801.\r\n  James Jackson,          ”  {1793   ”  1795.\r\n                             {1801   ”  1806.\r\n  George Walton,          ”   1795   ”  1796.\r\n  Josiah Tatnall,         ”   1796   ”  1799.\r\n  A.

He visited it in 1524. Ribault, a\r\nFrench protestant, sent out with a colony by Admiral Coligni, in 1564,\r\nnamed the southern coast Carolina, from Charles IX. (in Latin Carolus),\r\nKing of France. The colony was not permanent. In 1585 Sir Walter Raleigh\r\nmade an unsuccessful attempt to establish a colony on Roanoke Island.\r\nSome fifty years later the colonists of Virginia made a settlement in the\r\nlimits of this State, called Albemarle. This territory was patented to\r\na company of noblemen. The first colony, founded before this patent was\r\nissued, and enjoying entire liberty, became an asylum from the religious\r\nintolerance, almost universal at that time. In 1666 they numbered 800.\r\n\r\nMany French Huguenots, attracted by this freedom and the mild climate\r\nand extreme fertility of the soil, settled here and added greatly to the\r\nindustrious and virtuous elements of the population. The revolutionary\r\nstruggle was singularly bitter and bloody in this State and South\r\nCarolina, from the number and sanguinary character of the royalists and\r\ntories, and from the partisan or guerrilla mode of warfare adopted.\r\n\r\nThe majority were, however, determined and valiant patriots, and rendered\r\nit impossible for the British to establish a firm control over this part\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThe eastern surface is low, the western mountainous, and much of the\r\nmidland is covered with pine forests which produce large quantities of\r\nturpentine. The soil is favorable to agriculture. Yams, rice, and cotton,\r\nin addition to the cereals, are raised with success. The fisheries in\r\nAlbemarle Sound are an important source of wealth. A large number of\r\nminerals are found in the State. Like most of the Southern States, its\r\nresources have been but partially developed.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the original thirteen States, and has an area of 50,704\r\nsquare miles, equal to 32,450,560 acres, with a population of 1,069,614\r\n(one-third colored), and entitled to eight members of Congress. North\r\nCarolina, by act of 1866, was located in the fourth judicial circuit,\r\nwhich is composed of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nand South Carolina; and is divided into three judicial districts, called\r\nthe districts of Albemarle, Pamlico, and Cape Fear. The collection\r\ndistricts, and the ports of entry and delivery in this State have been so\r\noften modified and discontinued that there is some uncertainty as to the\r\nnumber. There are, as near as we can determine, ten districts, ten ports\r\nof entry, and nine ports of delivery.\r\n\r\nRaleigh is the capital. There the Legislature meets biennially on the\r\nfirst Monday in November. The State election is held on the first\r\nThursday in August.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the State of North Carolina, and it is hereby enacted\r\nby the authority of the same.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Samuel Johnson,       from  1789  to  1793.\r\n  Benjamin Hawkins,       ”   1789   ”  1795.\r\n  Alexander Martin,       ”   1793   ”  1799.\r\n  Timothy Bloodworth,     ”   1795   ”  1801.\r\n  Jesse Franklin          ”  {1799   ”  1805.\r\n                             {1807   ”  1813.\r\n  David Stone,            ”   1801   ”  1813.\r\n  James Turner,           ”   1805   ”  1816.\r\n  Nathaniel Macon,        ”   1815   ”  1828.\r\n  James Iredell,          ”   1828   ”  1831.\r\n  Montford Stokes,        ”   1816   ”  1823.\r\n  John Branch,            ”   1823   ”  1829.\r\n  Bedford Brown,          ”   1829   ”  1840.\r\n  Willie P.

It contains\r\nthe commercial metropolis of the country, which is connected, by its\r\ngreat navigable river, the Hudson, and the Erie canal, with the fertile\r\ninterior and the commerce of the chain of great lakes in the west; while\r\nLakes Ontario and Champlain furnish the means of profitable trade with\r\nCanada on the north. As its natural commercial facilities are unrivaled,\r\nso also, every auxiliary that can be furnished by art is employed to\r\ndevelop its resources and to attract trade and manufactures.\r\n\r\nIts river was discovered by the celebrated navigator, Captain Henry\r\nHudson, in 1609, and he gave it his name. He was employed, at this time\r\nby the Dutch, who claimed and settled the territory in the following\r\nyear. They established posts on Manhattan Island, where New York now\r\nstands, and at Albany—calling the country in general, New Netherlands.\r\nThey held it until 1644; laying claim, also, to Connecticut and New\r\nJersey. Their rule was despotic, and when the Duke of York, afterward\r\nJames II., King of England, sent a squadron to enforce English claims\r\nto it, the inhabitants declined to resist, and it became an English\r\ncolony without a struggle. The city and colony received the name of New\r\nYork and continued henceforth in English hands. Its position favored\r\na steady-growth in population and wealth; and it took an active part\r\nin the Revolution. Its central position made it the pivot of the war,\r\nthe leading struggles taking place in or near it. New York city was\r\nheld by the British during most of the war, but the skillful strategy\r\nand watchfulness of Washington, and the valor of his officers and\r\ntroops preserved the river in American hands throughout. It ratified\r\nthe Constitution July 26th, 1788, and soon outstripped every State\r\nin all things, except education, no State being able to compare with\r\nMassachusetts in that respect.\r\n\r\nNew York is the largest and richest city in the Union. The State abounds\r\nin salt and mineral springs, and its central and western parts are\r\nunexcelled for agriculture; while the eastern, more mountainous, but\r\nnearer to markets, and more abundant in water power, is equally favorable\r\nto grazing and manufactures.\r\n\r\nIts area is 47,000 square miles, equal to 30,080,000 acres. The\r\npopulation in 1870 was larger than that of any other State, being\r\nofficially stated at 4,364,411. It has thirty-three Members of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt forms part of the second judicial circuit, and has three judicial\r\ndistricts; eleven ports of entry, and fourteen ports of delivery, with\r\nthe privilege of eight or nine others if the President of the United\r\nStates deems them necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Capital is Albany. The State elections are held on the Tuesday after\r\nthe first Monday in November, and the Legislature meets on the first\r\nTuesday in January in each year. The style of the enacting clause is: “Be\r\nit enacted by the people of the State of New York represented in Senate\r\nand Assembly.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Philip Schuyler,      from  1789  to  1791.\r\n  Rufus King,             ”  {1789   ”  1796.\r\n                             {1813   ”  1825.\r\n  Aaron Burr,             ”   1791   ”  1797.\r\n  John Lawrence,          ”   1796   ”  1800.\r\n  John S.

His just and conciliatory conduct\r\ntoward the Indians, and the exemption of Pennsylvania from barbarous\r\nIndian wars, in consequence, proves the utility of the practice of\r\nunvarying justice and kindness toward them; and stands in strong and\r\nsignificant contrast with the opposite course, so often pursued, and with\r\nresults so distressing.\r\n\r\nA colony was established by Penn in the southeastern part of the State,\r\nin the year 1682. The government was conducted by a governor, a council\r\nof three, and a House of Delegates, chosen by the people. The largest\r\nreligious liberty was allowed, and punishment of crime was mitigated from\r\nthe severity, customary in those times, to something like the mildness\r\nnow practiced among us.\r\n\r\nThe colony enjoyed seventy years of enlightened government, and prospered\r\ngreatly. A large immigration of hardy and thrifty Germans and Swedes\r\nspread over the State and supplied, in Revolutionary times, the\r\n“fighting material” which the religious principles of the Quakers forbade\r\nthem to furnish.\r\n\r\nThe second eminent advantage of the State, was in its central position,\r\nthe facilities furnished to commerce and trade by the Delaware river on\r\nits eastern boundary, and the Ohio, on the west, connecting it with the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe third superiority, later in development in some of its features,\r\nrelates to its wealth of resources. Lying midway between north and south,\r\nits climate is temperate and mild. Its soil on the eastern border and\r\nalong the valleys of its numerous rivers is of great fertility; while its\r\ninexhaustible coal deposits are far more valuable in promoting the steady\r\ngrowth of her citizens in wealth than mines of gold. Iron, copper, zinc,\r\nmarble and slate are, apparently, inexhaustible. Her railroads and canals\r\nfurnish a suitable means for the development of these resources, and the\r\ntransportation for all her valuable commodities to profitable markets,\r\nand prove her later citizens to have inherited the economic wisdom and\r\nthrift of the founder of their State.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania valiantly bore the share in the struggles and sacrifices\r\nof the Revolution to which her position, her wealth and numbers, called\r\nher. Philadelphia—“The City of Brotherly Love” (the name means this,) was\r\nthe first capital of the Republic. It was there that the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was originated and signed.\r\n\r\nIts area is 46,000 square miles, equal to 29,440,000 acres. The\r\npopulation in 1870 was 3,515,993, entitling her to twenty-seven\r\nRepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is in the third judicial circuit; and forms two judicial districts.\r\nThere are two ports of entry, and two collection districts. Harrisburg is\r\nthe capital; the Legislature assembling on the first Tuesday in January,\r\nthe State elections being held the second Tuesday in October.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of her laws is: “Be it enacted by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in General\r\nAssembly met; and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  William Maclay,       from  1789  to  1791.\r\n  Robert Morris,          ”   1789   ”  1795.\r\n  Albert Gallatin,        ”   1793   ”  1794.\r\n  James Ross,             ”   1794   ”  1803.\r\n  William Bingham,        ”   1795   ”  1801.\r\n  Peter Muhlenburgh,      ”   1801   ”  1802.\r\n  Samuel Maclay,          ”   1803   ”  1808.\r\n  Michael Leib,           ”   1808   ”  1814.\r\n  Andrew Gregg,           ”   1807   ”  1813.\r\n  Abner Lacock,           ”   1813   ”  1819.\r\n  Jonathan Roberts,       ”   1814   ”  1821.\r\n  Walter Lawrie,          ”   1819   ”  1825.\r\n  William Findlay,        ”   1821   ”  1827.\r\n  William Marks,          ”   1825   ”  1831.\r\n  Isaac D.

It was the\r\ncolony in which the first permanent settlement was made, and for fourteen\r\nyears before the perils of the wilderness were encountered by the Puritan\r\nFathers of New England, it confronted famine and Indian hostility. Its\r\npeople were quite different in character from those of most of the other\r\ncolonies. While many were from the lowest classes, a goodly number of\r\nthe gentry and nobility of England were transplanted to this colony.\r\nSome were men of wealth, character and influence; and the hereditary\r\nvalue of that element became conspicuous when revolutionary times came,\r\nand the colonial government, which had been from the first, kept closely\r\ndependent on the royal will, being set aside, permitted to this class\r\na free field of action. None were more eloquent, more zealous, more\r\nvaliant or wise, during the “time that tried men’s souls.” The talents,\r\npatriotism, and wisdom of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and\r\nmany others almost equally useful, attest the quality of the Virginian\r\nstock of patriots, and shed honor on their native State.\r\n\r\nIt was settled in 1607, at Jamestown. The infant colony was long\r\nexposed to danger of destruction by Indian hostility; but, favored by\r\ncircumstances, grew up to strength, and became a protection to others.\r\nAn almost constant struggle was maintained with the royal governors,\r\nwho were disposed to encroach on their liberties. Notwithstanding the\r\nnumber of decayed and worthless _gentlemen_, and the dregs of the English\r\npopulace, who entered as components into her population, as a whole,\r\nthey proved worthy of the republic they so largely helped to rear. Their\r\nbest blood was spilled in its cause, and their material support was never\r\nwithheld in time of need.\r\n\r\nThis State is much varied in surface. In the southeast it is low and\r\nlevel; in the west and northwest mountainous, with numerous large streams\r\nand fertile vallies, and a charming climate. Its mineral wealth of coal,\r\niron and salt is very great; its water power for manufacturing purposes\r\nunsurpassed; and its commercial position everything to be desired. None\r\nof these advantages have been more than partially improved; and the\r\nfuture of the State is destined to be exceedingly brilliant. Old and\r\nnourishing colleges testify to the interest taken in education; and\r\nrailroads and other means of internal development have already prepared\r\nthe way for its greatness. She exports tobacco, flour, oysters, and\r\ncotton, and her agricultural wealth is constantly improving.\r\n\r\nVirginia is also one of the original thirteen States, and had an area\r\nprevious to the division in 1862, of 61,352 square miles, equal to\r\n39,265,280 acres; but after West Virginia was set off as a separate\r\nState, there were but 38,352 square miles left of this once great State,\r\nequal to 24,545,280 acres.\r\n\r\nThe population in 1860 amounted to 1,596,318, which entitles the State to\r\nnine Members of Congress. By the division the number of Representatives\r\nwas cut down to nine; the new State receiving three out of the twelve.\r\nPopulation in 1870, 1,224,830.\r\n\r\nVirginia lies in the fourth judicial circuit, which by the act of 1866,\r\nwas composed of this State, Maryland, West Virginia, and North Carolina\r\nand South Carolina. There were two judicial districts in this State,\r\nanterior to the division; the Eastern and the Western. There is now but\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere were also twelve collection districts in this State, and twelve\r\nports of entry, all of which remain the same as they were before West\r\nVirginia was cut off, for they were all located on the Atlantic coast, or\r\non the bays and rivers running into the Atlantic Ocean; there are also\r\nten ports of delivery.\r\n\r\nRichmond is the capital.

The noble company who had received a charter for the settlement\r\nand government of the Carolinas employed the celebrated philosopher,\r\nJohn Locke, to draw up a philosophical plan of government, which they\r\nattempted to carry into effect to the great annoyance of the colonists.\r\nIt proved impracticable, and was finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe French introduced the culture of the vine with success, and rice was\r\nbrought at an early day from Madagascar, the cultivation of which became\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\nMany vexations were endured by the colonists by the injudicious\r\nmanagement of the proprietary government, and at length they, by\r\npetition, obtained a revocation of the charter, receiving, in 1720, a\r\ngovernor appointed by the crown. They endured for many years all the\r\nhorrors of warfare with the Tuscarora Indians, whom they finally defeated\r\nand expelled. Rutledge, Sumpter, and Marion were distinguished leaders of\r\nthe patriots during the occupation of the State by the British forces;\r\nemploying with success a partisan warfare, and defying the efforts of a\r\nsuperior British force to hold the State in subjection.\r\n\r\nThe climate has been likened to that of Italy, and the products of the\r\nnorth and of the tropics are equally cultivated. The State abounds in\r\nagricultural and manufacturing resources, and has a fine commercial\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina is one of the original thirteen States, and has an area\r\nof 29,385 square miles, making 18,806,400 acres, with a population, in\r\n1870, of 728,000, (over half colored,) which gives her five Members of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBy an act of 1866, South Carolina was located in the fourth judicial\r\ncircuit; it is divided into two judicial districts, called the Eastern\r\nand Western.\r\n\r\nThere are three collection districts in this State, and four ports of\r\nentry, to-wit: Georgetown, Charleston, Beaufort and Port Royal; but no\r\nports of delivery.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Columbia.

It was called\r\nMaryland from the queen of Charles I., King of England. A part of this\r\npatent was covered by that subsequently made to William Penn, and\r\nproduced much trouble between the descendants of these men, and their\r\nrespective colonies. A settlement was commenced, mainly by catholic\r\ngentlemen, in 1634, and called St. Mary’s, on a branch of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nThe wise liberality that distinguished the settlement of Pennsylvania\r\nmarked all the earlier history of Maryland. They cultivated friendly\r\nrelations with the natives and with their neighbors. Lord Baltimore was\r\nliberal in his expenditures for the growing colony, and gave them a\r\nliberal government. When the civil war commenced in England, resulting\r\nin the death of Charles I. and the rise of Cromwell to power, the first\r\ntroubles of the colonists of Maryland began, and continued until 1716,\r\nwhen the heirs of the original proprietor resumed their rights and\r\nmaintained them until the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis State was one of the original thirteen, and gave a hearty support to\r\nthe patriot side during the war for freedom.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the country is, in great part, low and sandy; the climate\r\nagreeable and the soil favorable to agricultural pursuits. Her commercial\r\nposition is excellent, being situated on either side of Chesapeake bay\r\nand bounded by the Potomac river on the west. The District of Columbia,\r\ncontaining the National Capital, was located on the last named river\r\nwithin her limits.\r\n\r\nMaryland has an area of 11,124 square miles—equal to 7,119,360 acres.\r\nThe population in 1870 was 780,806, which gives her six Representatives\r\nin Congress. By an act of Congress, passed in 1866, this State was put\r\nin the fourth judicial circuit, which is composed of Maryland, Virginia,\r\nWest Virginia, North and South Carolina. Maryland constitutes one\r\njudicial district; has ten ports of entry, viz.: Baltimore, Chester,\r\nOxford, Vienna, Snow-Hill, Annapolis, Nottingham, St. Mary’s, Georgetown,\r\nand Havre de Grace; and twelve ports of delivery.\r\n\r\nAnnapolis is the capital. The State election is held on the Tuesday\r\nafter the first Monday in November.

It is\r\nsmall, having an area of only 9,280 square miles, which make 5,939,200\r\nacres. Its population in 1870 was 318,300, entitling it to three\r\nRepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement was founded at Dover, in 1624, by the English. It\r\nsuffered much from Indian wars, and its growth was slow. It was made a\r\nseparate province in 1680, having previously been under the jurisdiction\r\nof Massachusetts. It was one of the original thirteen States, and took an\r\nactive and vigorous part in the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nIts soil is light and unfavorable to agriculture, but furnishes good\r\npasturage and produces fine cattle. It contains the White Mountains,\r\nthe highest in New England. Its streams are utilized for manufacturing\r\npurposes. Quarries of marble and granite abound. Minerals, and precious\r\nstones of several varieties are found in various parts of the State. The\r\nhardy and enterprising sons to whom it has given birth are to be found in\r\nevery State in the Union.\r\n\r\nIt lies in the first judicial circuit; constitutes one judicial district;\r\nand is embraced in one collection district, and therefore has but one\r\nport of entry. There are three ports of delivery.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Concord. The Legislature assembles on the first Monday in\r\nJune, the State election being held the second Tuesday in March.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws runs thus: “Be it enacted by the Senate\r\nand House of Representatives in General Assembly convened.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Paine Wingate,        from  1789  to  1793.\r\n  John Langdon,           ”   1789   ”  1801.\r\n  Samuel Livermore,       ”   1793   ”  1801.\r\n  Simeon Olcott,          ”   1801   ”  1805.\r\n  James Sheafe,           ”   1801   ”  1802.\r\n  William Plummer,        ”   1802   ”  1807.\r\n  Nicholas Gilman,        ”   1805   ”  1814.\r\n  Nahum Parker,           ”   1807   ”  1810.\r\n  Charles Cutts,          ”   1810   ”  1813.\r\n  Jeremiah Mason,         ”   1813   ”  1817.\r\n  Thomas W.

They, however,\r\nsoon fell under the control of the Dutch, who claimed the territory. The\r\nnext settlement was made at Elizabethtown, from Long Island, in 1664. New\r\nJersey came into the hands of the English along with New Netherlands,\r\nbut soon became an independent province; Philip Carteret becoming its\r\nfirst governor, in 1665. It was for some time under the control of the\r\ncelebrated Quaker, William Penn, received a liberal form of government,\r\nand, not suffering from the Indians enjoyed prosperity for many years.\r\nAfterwards it passed through various vicissitudes in its government, was\r\nfor a time joined to New York, but recovered its independent existence\r\nin 1738; and was one of the original thirteen States, taking a very\r\nprominent part in the Revolution. Its territory, lying between New York\r\nand Philadelphia, was the field on which the hostile armies fought and\r\nmanouvered, for some years. It ratified the Constitution unanimously,\r\nDecember 18th, 1787. It has been rewarded for its patriotism and devotion\r\nto liberty by unbroken prosperity. Its manufactures are in a flourishing\r\nstate. Its vicinity to the great commercial centres of the Atlantic\r\ncoast; the mildness of its climate, and the adaptation of its soil to\r\nthe growth of fruit and vegetables have made it the Garden State of the\r\nUnion. Its agricultural wealth is much increased by its abundant beds of\r\nmarl and peat. The extreme north is hilly and the extreme south low and\r\nsandy. Education receives much attention.\r\n\r\nIt has an area of 8,320 square miles, or 5,324,800 acres.

They were men of great\r\nresolution and intelligence, and succeeded in imbuing the new colony\r\nwith a fair degree of their own virtue. They suffered much, at first,\r\nfrom deprivation of the comforts they had left in England, and from the\r\nhostility of the Indians. They were too much in earnest to be tolerant,\r\nand persecutions of pretended witches, of Quakers and Baptists, have\r\ngiven them an unenviable notoriety.\r\n\r\nThis State was a leading one among the original thirteen, and the\r\nfirst to take up arms and to be invaded by the British forces at the\r\ncommencement of the War of the Revolution. Her influence on the national\r\ncharacter has been great.\r\n\r\nThis State is the first in the Union for cotton and woolen manufactures,\r\nits cotton mills alone employing about twenty-five thousand hands. In\r\nextent of all its manufactures it is third in the Union. The soil is\r\nsterile in great part, but the energy of the people finds abundant other\r\nsources of wealth. Commerce and fisheries receive much attention, and\r\nproduce much wealth.\r\n\r\nEducation is carefully attended to, and its public school system a model\r\nfor other States. She has an area of 7,800 square miles. Her population\r\nin 1870 was 1,457,351, and entitles her to eleven Members of Congress. It\r\nis in the first judicial circuit, and forms one judicial district. There\r\nare fourteen ports of entry, and twenty-five ports of delivery in this\r\nState.\r\n\r\nBoston is the Capital, the metropolis of New England, and an important\r\ncenter of intellectual and business energy. The Legislature meets on\r\nthe first Wednesday in January, and the State elections are held on the\r\nTuesday after the first Monday in January.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause is: “Be it enacted by the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the\r\nsame, as follows:”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Tristram Dalton,      from  1789  to  1791.\r\n  Caleb Strong,           ”   1789   ”  1796.\r\n  George Cabot,           ”   1791   ”  1796.\r\n  Theo.

It was settled in\r\n1633 from Massachusetts, the fertility of the valley of the Connecticut\r\nattracting them to brave the perils of conflict with the Indians, and\r\nwith the Dutch, settled where New York now stands, who laid claim to it.\r\nThe Dutch withdrew, the Indians were subdued in many bloody battles,\r\nand a Puritan State—exceeding, if possible, the religious strictness of\r\nthe Massachusetts colony, and not behind her in energy, in virtue, in\r\nattention to education, and love of liberty—soon grew up to wealth and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nA decisive battle in 1636, on the Mystic river, annihilated the Pequod\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nConnecticut, in 1700, followed the example set by Massachusetts in 1638,\r\nby founding Yale college, which, to this day, very fairly rivals Harvard\r\nin the former State. Both have contributed largely to the intelligence\r\nand culture of the American people. It took a leading part in the\r\nRevolution; ratified the constitution June 9th, 1788; and has displayed\r\nthe zeal in promoting the public good that has been so prominent in the\r\ncultivation of her educational and material interests.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the State is uneven and rocky. Manufactures and commerce\r\nare the leading interests, although agriculture is not neglected. It is\r\nrich in minerals. Gold, silver, lead, iron, copper and bismuth are found,\r\nwhile marble, of fine quality, and granite abound.\r\n\r\nIts area is small, embracing only 4,674 square miles, or 2,991,360\r\nacres. It has four representatives in Congress. The population in 1870\r\nwas 537,418. It is part of the second judicial circuit, and constitutes\r\none judicial district. She has five ports of entry, and five collection\r\ndistricts, with twenty-two ports of delivery.\r\n\r\nIt has had two capitals ever since the first two colonies, established at\r\nHartford and New Haven, were united; and holds her State election on the\r\nfirst Monday in April.

European\r\nwars, in which he was engaged, and in which he lost his life in 1633,\r\ndeferred the project, but it was carried into effect in 1638, near the\r\npresent city of Wilmington. They extended their settlements from the\r\nentrance of Delaware bay far up the river, until the Dutch, from New\r\nNetherlands, who claimed the country, attacked and reduced them to\r\nsubmission, uniting New Sweden, as it had been called, to their own\r\ncolony, in the year 1655. It fell, with that colony, into the hands of\r\nthe English in 1664. It was included in the grant made to William Penn,\r\nin 1692. It was long attached to Pennsylvania, but in 1703 received\r\npermission to form a separate government, on the wise and liberal\r\nplan pursued by Penn. This form of government continued through the\r\nRevolutionary war.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the State is level, or gently undulating, the climate is\r\nagreeable, except that, in winter, the sea breeze is somewhat harsh; the\r\nsoil is sandy but fertile. Grain and fruit are raised, peaches being\r\nproduced in great profusion. Her commercial and manufacturing business is\r\nlimited, and she is destitute of mineral wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is next to Rhode Island in size, containing the small area of 2,120\r\nsquare miles, or 1,356,800 acres.

These claims were vigorously resisted, but it\r\nhad no organized government until 1777. It did good service in the\r\nRevolution; but was not admitted into the Union until 1791, making the\r\nfourteenth State. Col. Ethan Allen at the head of 270 “Green Mountain\r\nBoys” took possession of Forts Ticonderoga and Crown Point in the name of\r\nthe Continental Congress, in 1775, and thus assured the northern water\r\ncommunication with Canada to the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Vermont though cold, is pleasant and even, the soil\r\nfertile in the valleys, and the streams supply excellent water power,\r\nwhich, however, is little used. Maple sugar is produced in abundance,\r\nwhile its facilities for raising stock are equal to those of New\r\nHampshire. Granite, marble of fine quality, and slate quarries abound.\r\nIts provision for education is very liberal.\r\n\r\nIt has three representatives in Congress; forms part of the second\r\njudicial circuit, and constitutes one judicial district. One port of\r\nentry and two of delivery are authorized to be named by the President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nMontpelier is the capital. The State election is held on the first\r\nTuesday in September, and the Legislature meets on the first Wednesday in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause begins: “It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly\r\nof the State of Vermont.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Moses Robinson,       from  1791  to  1796.\r\n  Stephen R.

The celebrated Daniel Boone was among the\r\nfirst white men to explore the wilderness of Kentucky. The first white\r\nsettlement was commenced at Boonesborough, about the year 1769. The area\r\nof the State is 37,680 square miles, equal to 24,115,200 acres.\r\n\r\nThe climate is mild, and adapted to the production of cereals, grapes,\r\nand fruits. The soil is very fertile. The surface presents a varied\r\naspect in its several portions. The southeastern part of the State is\r\nmountainous, the central and northern portions are undulating, sometimes\r\nhilly. The river bottoms are very productive. The State is well timbered.\r\nApple, pear, peach, plum and various other fruit trees are cultivated\r\nwith great success. The staple products are corn, tobacco and hemp.\r\nHorses, mules and cattle are raised. Kentucky abounds in bituminous coal,\r\nlead, iron pyrites, marble, freestone, gypsum, and cliff limestone.\r\n\r\nThe population in 1870 was 1,321,000. She is entitled to ten\r\nrepresentatives in Congress, is in the sixth judicial circuit and forms\r\none judicial district, has one port of entry, Louisville, and two ports\r\nof delivery, viz.: Paducah and Columbus. Frankfort is the capital.\r\n\r\nThe State elections are held on the first Monday in August. The\r\nLegislature meets on the first Monday in December, and is composed of two\r\nhouses—the Senate consisting of 38 members elected for four years; and a\r\nHouse of Representatives elected for two years. The enacting clause of\r\nthe laws is: “Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth\r\nof Kentucky.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  John Brown,           from  1792  to  1805.\r\n  John Edwards,           ”   1792   ”  1795.\r\n  Humphrey Marshall,      ”   1795   ”  1801.\r\n  John Breckenridge,      ”   1801   ”  1805.\r\n  Buckner Thurston,       ”   1805   ”  1810.\r\n  John Adair,             ”  {1805   ”  1806.\r\n                             {1806   ”  1807.\r\n                             {1810   ”  1811.\r\n  Henry Clay,             ”  {1831   ”  1842.\r\n                             {1849   ”  1855.\r\n  John Pope,              ”   1807   ”  1813.\r\n  George M.

They built Fort Loudon in\r\nEast Tennessee, but were destroyed, or driven away, by the Indians, in\r\n1760. Settlement was soon resumed, but continually harrassed by Indian\r\nattacks. In 1774 Col. Lewis and Capt. Shelby attacked and defeated them.\r\nThey remained quiet until after the Declaration of Independence, when\r\nthe Cherokees were stirred up by British emissaries. From 1776 to 1779\r\nthree several expeditions were made against them, the Indians being\r\ndecisively defeated each time. The Cherokees and Shawnees were warlike\r\ntribes, and continued, for some years, to make occasional attacks on the\r\nsettlements, which did not, however, prevent their steady growth.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 North Carolina renounced her claim to the territory, and in\r\n1790 it became a separate province, being admitted into the Union as a\r\nSovereign State in 1796, making the sixteenth, or the third admitted\r\nafter the Revolutionary war—Vermont, in 1791, being the first; and\r\nKentucky, in 1792, the second.\r\n\r\nThis State has an area of 45,600 square miles, or 29,184,000 acres. It\r\nhad a population in 1870 of 1,257,983.\r\n\r\nTennessee is very agreeably diversified with mountain, hill and dale,\r\ncontaining within its limits fertility of soil, beauty of scenery, and a\r\ndelightfully temperate climate. The State is generally healthy. The soil\r\nin the main is good, and while among the mountains it is not arable, it\r\nis favorable for grazing, and stock is largely exported.\r\n\r\nIndian corn, tobacco, and cotton are the great staples.\r\n\r\nGold has been found in the south-east portion of the State. Among the\r\nother minerals found here are iron in abundance, some lead, silver, zinc,\r\nmarble of very fine quality, and various others. The State is entitled\r\nto ten Representatives in Congress; is in the sixth judicial circuit;\r\nhas three judicial districts; and has two ports of delivery—Memphis and\r\nKnoxville.\r\n\r\nNashville is the capital. The State election is held on the first Monday\r\nin August, and the Legislature meets on the first Monday in October,\r\nonce in two years. The Legislature consists of a Senate of twenty-five\r\nmembers, and a House of Representatives of seventy-five members.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws of this State is: “Be it enacted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the State of Tennessee.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  William Blount,       from  1796  to  1797.\r\n  William Cocke,          ”  {1796   ”  1797.\r\n                             {1799   ”  1805.\r\n  Andrew Jackson,         ”  {1797   ”  1798.\r\n                             {1823   ”  1825.\r\n  Joseph Anderson,        ”   1797   ”  1815.\r\n  Daniel Smith,           ”   1797   ”  1809.\r\n  Jenkin Whiteside,       ”   1809   ”  1811.\r\n  George W.

Though this fine territory lay nearest to the\r\nmost populous and enterprising of the original States, the intrigues of\r\nthe French before the Revolution, the hostility to which they excited\r\nthe Indians, and the difficulties arising from the various claims\r\nof different States to the lands, which rendered titles insecure,\r\nprevented any permanent settlement until about the time when the present\r\nConstitution of the United States was originated. All these difficulties\r\nwere now removed, and emigration, long restrained, rushed like a flood\r\ndown the Ohio. 20,000 persons, during this year (1788), passed down the\r\nriver in pursuit of new homes. Cincinnati and many other places were\r\nsettled about this time. From 1790 to 1795 there was much suffering\r\nfrom the hostility of the Indians; but this period having passed, the\r\nsettlements multiplied and grew apace.\r\n\r\nThe settlers were, in large part, from New England; accustomed to wring a\r\nthrifty living from a rocky soil; and their industry soon brought great\r\nresults from this more generous field. The population increased rapidly.\r\nIn 14 years it amounted to 72,000; and was admitted into the Union with\r\nthat number Nov. 29th, 1802.\r\n\r\nThe climate is healthy and mild, the soil generally very fertile, and her\r\ninhabitants have made the most of it. Coal, iron, and marble are very\r\nabundant. Manufactures have not been much developed in this State, but\r\nthey are steadily growing. The lake on the north, and the river on the\r\nsouth, with more than 5,000 miles of railway and canals, furnish all the\r\nelements of a great and steady growth.\r\n\r\nIt was, on its admission, the seventeenth State in the Union.\r\n\r\nIt has an area of 39,964 square miles, equal to 25,576,960 acres. The\r\npopulation in 1870 was 2,622,214, entitling her to twenty Members of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is in the sixth judicial circuit, and forms two judicial districts,\r\nthe Northern and Southern.\r\n\r\nThis State has three ports of entry—Cleveland, Toledo, and Portland; and\r\nfour ports of delivery, to be located where the President directs.\r\n\r\nThe capital of this State is Columbus. The State election is now held on\r\nthe second Tuesday of October. The Legislature meets on the first Monday\r\nof January, biennially.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the State of Ohio.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  John Smith,           from  1803  to  1808.\r\n  Thos.

Failing in\r\nthis, they made no settlements. The French planned the establishment of a\r\nvast empire covering the best territory now in the bounds of the United\r\nStates, and explored the Mississippi and its tributaries with untiring\r\ncourage and zeal, both from the Great Lakes and from the mouth of the\r\nriver. A few years after La Salle had perished in his bold wandering, a\r\nFrench naval officer, Lemoine D’Iberville, formed the first settlement in\r\nLouisiana (so named after the French King, Louis XIV., by La Salle.) This\r\nwas in 1699; but no great progress was made until the Mississippi Company\r\nwas formed in France, under the idea that Louisiana was rich in gold and\r\ndiamonds; when, in 1718, eight hundred persons emigrated from France\r\nand settled at New Orleans. In 1732 the colony contained, in all, seven\r\nthousand five hundred persons, and continued to prosper until 1763, when,\r\nby the peace of Paris, all the French possessions in America except the\r\nterritory west of the Great River, were given up to England. This remnant\r\nsoon passed to the Spaniards, and again to the French, from whom it was\r\nbought by President Jefferson for $15,000,000, in 1803.\r\n\r\nThis purchase was regarded, even by Jefferson, as probably exceeding the\r\npowers of the government, under the Constitution; but it was essential\r\nto the development, unity, and greatness of the country. The Mississippi\r\nValley is the heart of North America, and the use of the river as\r\nnecessary to the value of the prairie States lying east of it, as to the\r\ndefense and strength of the country. The possession of it could, alone,\r\nmake the United States a great power among nations. Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nthen First Consul of the French Republic, designed, in ceding it to the\r\nUnited States, to give England, his relentless enemy, a powerful rival;\r\nbut even his keen foresight could not have anticipated the wonderful\r\ngrowth in which the Louisiana Purchase was so necessary an element.\r\n\r\nThe surface of Louisiana is low, and the southern part often overflowed\r\nby the high water of the rivers. Many islands of great fertility and\r\nbeauty lie along the coast; one of them consisting of an immense bed or\r\nmine of rock salt. Fruits grow to great perfection and orange trees are\r\nspecially fruitful, a single tree often bearing 5,000 oranges. Cotton\r\nand cane sugar are the principal staples. New Orleans has an extensive\r\ncommerce, and manufactures will sometime find in it a profitable field.\r\nThe palmy days of this, as of all the other Southern States, is in the\r\nfuture; her most valuable resources having been scarcely touched. New\r\nOrleans will naturally become the third great commercial city of the\r\nUnion, New York and San Francisco, only, being likely to take precedence\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nLouisiana was admitted into the Union April 8th, 1812, making the\r\neighteenth State.\r\n\r\nShe has an area of 46,431 square miles, equal to 29,715,840 acres. The\r\npopulation in 1870 numbered 732,731; she has six Representatives in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nLouisiana forms a part of the fifth judicial circuit, and constitutes two\r\njudicial districts, viz.: the eastern and western districts of Louisiana.\r\nThis State has one collection district, denominated the district of New\r\nOrleans; which city is the only port of entry. The shores of the river\r\nOhio, and all the rivers emptying into the Mississippi, are attached\r\nto the district of New Orleans, though most of them do not lie in the\r\nState. Several of the cities and towns on these rivers are made ports of\r\ndelivery. Collection districts are not always confined to one State.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans is the capital. The Legislature meets on the first Monday\r\nin January, once in two years. The State election is held on the first\r\nMonday in November.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of her laws is as follows: “Be it enacted by the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives of the State of Louisiana, in General\r\nAssembly convened.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Posey,    October to December, 1812.\r\n  James Brown,          from {1812  to  1817.\r\n                             {1819   ”  1824.\r\n  Allan B.

Indiana was first explored by the enterprising French Jesuits, who\r\nhighly appreciated the beauty, resources, and grand future of the vast\r\nMississippi valley. Wiser than their sovereign, Louis XIV., they would\r\nhave taken firm and effectual possession of all this region, from the\r\nGreat Lakes to the Gulf, but Louis was too much occupied with his\r\npalaces, the splendor of his court, the banishment of Protestants,\r\nand war with his neighbors to lend a due support to their plans. They\r\nexplored the region in 1682, formed a settlement at Vincennes in 1730,\r\nand made friends of the Indians. The career of the French, in Europe and\r\nAmerica, was checked by the extravagance of the Court, and disastrous\r\nwars; and this little colony remained for nearly three generations\r\nsolitary and stationary in the wilderness; fraternizing with the Indians\r\nand enjoying life as only the French can under such dreary circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. After the Revolution all this region was included in the Northwest\r\nTerritory. The grim earnestness of the Americans in pushing their\r\nfortunes alarmed, without conciliating, the Indians, and for a long time\r\na deadly struggle alone could preserve the growing settlements from\r\ntotal extinction. The brave and talented Tecumseh and his twin brother,\r\nthe Prophet, made a desperate effort to drive back or exterminate the\r\nsettlers; but they were conquered, and the Indians retreated, step by\r\nstep, before the advancing flood of emigration. In 1809 Indiana was\r\nerected in to a separate Territory, and admitted into the Union as\r\na separate State on the 11th of Dec., 1816. It is 275 miles long by\r\n135 in width. The surface is mainly level or gently undulating; the\r\nirregularities in the southern part, seldom rising more than two hundred\r\nfeet, but with a rocky foundation to the soil, presenting many advantages\r\nto manufactures along the streams; these facilities are increased by\r\nthe extent and value of bituminous coal deposits which underlie nearly\r\none-fourth of the area of the State.\r\n\r\n3. Indiana has a happier mixture of prairie and woodland than any\r\nother western State. Its commercial facilities are great. Reaching\r\nLake Michigan on the northwest, Chicago forms a fine metropolis for\r\nthe northern parts; while the Ohio on the south furnishes cheap\r\ntransportation to Cincinnati and Pittsburg toward the east, or New\r\nOrleans to the southwest. Lying between the fertile and busy regions\r\nwest and the great eastern markets, it is crossed in all directions by\r\nrailroads. It is in the centre of the most highly favored part of the\r\nUnion, and its advantages and resources seem boundless. Its staple in\r\nagriculture is corn, but all the grains, vegetables, and fruits of the\r\ntemperate zone are raised with success. The climate is mild, but it lies\r\nin the region of variableness in weather characterizing all the western\r\nStates in its latitude.\r\n\r\nThe resources of the State have been in a course of rapid and\r\nuninterrupted development for 60 years, but they are so great, and there\r\nare so many other inviting fields luring emigrants further west, that a\r\ncomparatively small part of its wealth has yet been reached. There is a\r\nmagnificent provision for education, and its intelligent and enterprising\r\ncitizens are worthy of the Great Republic.\r\n\r\n4. Indiana was the nineteenth State in the Union. She has an area of\r\n33,809 square miles, equal to 21,637,760 acres. Her population in\r\n1870 was 1,673,046, which entitles her to thirteen Representatives in\r\nCongress. Indiana is the seventh judicial circuit, and forms one judicial\r\ndistrict. There is no port of entry in this State; but there are three\r\nports of delivery, to-wit: Evansville, New Albany, and Madison which are\r\nattached to the New Orleans collection district.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Indianapolis. The State election is held on the second\r\nTuesday of October. The Legislature meets only once in two years, on the\r\nfirst Wednesday of January.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of her laws is in these words: “Be it enacted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the State of Indiana.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  James Noble,          from  1816  to  1831.\r\n  W.

The first settlement was made by\r\nthe French, at Natchez, in 1716. It was one of a chain of settlements by\r\nwhich they proposed to connect the basins of the St. Lawrence and the\r\ngreat lakes with the Mississippi valley and the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Natchez Indians gave the early colonists great trouble, but were\r\nfinally so completely conquered that the national name became extinct,\r\nthe few remnants surviving, becoming incorporated with other tribes. They\r\nwere supposed to have anciently emigrated from Mexico or South America,\r\nsome of their customs being similar to those of the Peruvians.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 the French ceded all this territory to England, except that of\r\nLouisiana, which became the possession of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Choctaw Indians held possession of the northern part of the State for\r\na long time, and became considerably civilized.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of the State is prairie, the soil being extremely\r\nrich, while the south is sandy. The surface is generally level or\r\nundulating. Commerce and agriculture form its principal resources; though\r\nneither have been highly developed. Cotton is the principal staple. It is\r\nremarkably well adapted to the growth of fruit, though it has been very\r\nlittle cultivated. The State is well supplied with railroads, which, with\r\nthe Mississippi flowing the whole length of her western boundary, furnish\r\nample transportation for all the produce of her fertile soil.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Mississippi became a State in 1817; making the\r\ntwentieth State. The area is 47,156 square miles, equal to 30,179,840\r\nacres. The population in 1870 numbered 834,170; which entitles her to\r\nsix Representatives in Congress. The State lies in the fifth judicial\r\ncircuit, and is divided into two judicial districts, viz.: the Northern\r\nand Southern districts of Mississippi. She has three ports of entry,\r\nviz.: Natchez, Vicksburg, and one near the mouth of Pearl river, to\r\nbe established whenever the President may direct; also three ports of\r\ndelivery, viz.: Grand Gulf, Ship Island and Columbus.\r\n\r\nJackson is the capital. The State election is held on the Tuesday after\r\nthe first Monday in November, and her Legislature meets biennially on the\r\nTuesday after the first Monday in January.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws is in these words: “Be it enacted by\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Mississippi in\r\nGeneral Assembly convened.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Walter Leake,         from  1817  to  1820.\r\n  Thomas H.

The oldest permanent settlement in\r\nthe valley of the Mississippi was made at Kaskaskia, in this State, in\r\nthe year 1720, by the French. The name of the State is derived from\r\nthe aboriginal inhabitants. In the Indian dialect it was “Illini,” and\r\nsignified a perfectly formed man. The French settlers changed the name to\r\nIllinois. This State was formed from what was known as the Northwestern\r\nterritory, and was the twenty-first of the American Union. It was\r\nadmitted and became an independent State on the 3d day of December,\r\n1818. It has an area of 55,405 square miles, equal to 35,459,200 acres.\r\nIts population in 1870 was 2,539,638. Extending through more than five\r\ndegrees of latitude, Illinois has quite a variety of climate. The surface\r\nis level. The soil is fertile and the agricultural capabilities of this\r\nState are not surpassed by any sister State, if indeed by any portion of\r\nearth’s surface, of equal extent. Her staple products are corn, wheat,\r\noats, potatoes, hay, and products of the dairy, besides large quantities\r\nof fruit. The State is rich in minerals. A large portion of the lead\r\nproducing region of the country is in this State. Bituminous coal is\r\nfound in almost every county in the State. Copper is found in large\r\nquantities in the north, and iron in both south and north. Lime, zinc,\r\nmarble of excellent quality, freestone, gypsum, and other minerals, are\r\nfound in various parts.\r\n\r\nThe State is entitled to nineteen representatives in Congress, and forms\r\na part of the seventh judicial circuit. It forms two judicial districts,\r\nviz.: northern and southern. It has one port of entry, Chicago, and four\r\nports of delivery, viz.: Alton, Quincy, Cairo, and Peoria. The capital\r\nis Springfield. The State election is held on the Tuesday after the\r\nfirst Monday in November. The legislature meets biennially on the first\r\nMonday in January.

It then became a part of the Mississippi territory, but was\r\nseparated when Mississippi became a State, in 1817.\r\n\r\nIt was settled in 1711, at Mobile, by the French, it being a part of the\r\nterritory explored and claimed for France by La Salle in 1684. The Indian\r\nname of Alabama means “Here we rest.” Its soil can scarcely be excelled\r\nfor fertility in the world. It has every variety of climate, from the\r\nhigh and stern severity of a mountain region in the north, through all\r\ngradations, to the heat and luxuriant vegetation of the tropics along the\r\nsouthern coast. The center abounds in coal and iron, and various other\r\nminerals are found in abundance. Until the Revolution it was a hunting\r\nground for the Indians. Being then stirred up by British emissaries, and\r\nthreatening the security of the frontiers, they were severely chastised.\r\nAfter the return of peace, when the growing wealth and population of\r\nthe original States excited them to enterprise, the territory invited\r\npopulation by its surpassing fertility, and it graduated to the\r\nimportance of a sovereign State by admission into the Union, Dec. 14th,\r\n1819, forming the twenty-second State.\r\n\r\nIt has an area of 50,722 square miles, equal to 32,462,080 acres, and\r\nhad a population in 1870 of 966,988, by which she is entitled to eight\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIt forms a part of the fifth judicial circuit, and is divided into three\r\njudicial districts, the Northern, Middle and Southern.\r\n\r\nIt has one port of entry, (Mobile,) and two ports of delivery, viz.:\r\nTuscumbia and Selma.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the State is Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe State election is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in\r\nNovember.

It was at first a province, granted\r\nby charter to Sir Ferdinand Gorges, by the King of England, in 1638; but\r\nwas united with Massachusetts by purchase in 1652. It was settled by\r\nthe English, at Bristol, in 1625. It was admitted as a State into the\r\nUnion March 15th, 1820, being the twenty-third in order of admission. It\r\ncontains 31,766 square miles, or 20,330,240 acres in area. In 1870 the\r\npopulation was 626,463.\r\n\r\nIt has now five Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of this State is almost a wilderness, and furnishes\r\nlarge quantities of lumber, which are floated down her large rivers, and\r\nsupplied, in great abundance, to the Atlantic seaports, and the West\r\nIndies. Ship-building is an extensive branch of industry, the great\r\nlength and irregular line of coast forming numerous harbors. It has\r\nextensive fisheries, and a large sea-faring population. Its numerous\r\nstreams are highly favorable to manufactures, though comparatively little\r\nhas as yet been done in this direction. The climate is severe and the\r\nsoil somewhat sterile, so that it ranks low as an agricultural State. It\r\nhas received comparatively few additions to its population by foreign\r\nimmigration; and its inhabitants are mainly from the old English stock,\r\nand the State ranks high in morality. It depletes itself by furnishing,\r\nlike many other of the older States, annually, a large number of\r\nvigorous, enterprising young men to settle the new and fertile regions of\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nIt forms part of the first judicial circuit, and constitutes one\r\njudicial district. It has thirteen ports of entry, and thirty-two ports\r\nof delivery.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Augusta, on the Kennebec river.\r\n\r\nThe State elections are held on the second Monday of September; and the\r\nLegislature meets on the first Wednesday of January in each year.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of its laws is: “Be it enacted by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives, in Legislature assembled.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  John Holmes,          from  1820  to  1833.\r\n  John Chandler,          ”   1820   ”  1829.\r\n  Albion P.

Here a fort was established, called Fort\r\nOrleans, and the neighboring lead mines were worked the next year.\r\nSt. Genevieve, the oldest town in the State, was settled in 1755, and\r\nSt. Louis in 1764. In 1763 it, with all the territory west of the\r\nMississippi, was assigned by treaty to Spain. This territory was ceded\r\nback to France in 1801, and with Louisiana was purchased by the United\r\nStates in 1803. It remained a part of Louisiana until the admission of\r\nthe State of that name, when the remaining portion of that purchase was\r\ncalled Missouri. In 1821 it was admitted into the Union, forming the\r\ntwenty-fourth State. This State has an area of 67,380 square miles, equal\r\nto 43,123,200 acres.\r\n\r\nHer population in 1870 was 1,715,000, entitling her to thirteen\r\nRepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Missouri is variable; in winter the thermometer sinks\r\nbelow zero; the summers are excessively hot; the air is dry and pure.\r\nThe State is quite as healthful as any in the west. The soil is good and\r\nof great agricultural capabilities. The great staple is Indian corn. The\r\nother products cultivated largely are hemp, wheat, oats, tobacco. Sheep\r\nand cattle are considerably raised, and fruit culture is successful.\r\n\r\nThis State is in the eighth judicial circuit; and forms two judicial\r\ndistricts, the Eastern and Western. It has no port of entry, and but one\r\nport of delivery, Hannibal.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Jefferson City. The State election is held on the Tuesday\r\nafter the first Monday in November, and the Legislature meets on the last\r\nMonday of December.

It was explored by Jesuit\r\nmissionaries, who established numerous missions among various Indian\r\ntribes, and pushed their way, through perils and fatigues, west to\r\nthe Mississippi, which, they followed far north and south; to be soon\r\noutstripped by the adventurous La Salle. Detroit was founded about 1701.\r\nThe settlements made little progress under French rule; and when, in\r\n1763, it passed under English control, the conspiracy of Pontiac nearly\r\ndestroyed them. It was not till 1796 that the United States government\r\ntook possession of the territory. Its growth was much retarded by the war\r\nof 1812, when it endured, for two years, all the barbarities of Indian\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nA territorial government was organized in 1805. In 1818 the lands\r\nwere brought into the market, since which its prosperity has been\r\nuninterrupted. It is remarkable in its position, and eminently so by\r\nits resources. The southern peninsula is very productive. The northern\r\npeninsula contains the richest copper mines in the world, and unlimited\r\nsupplies of iron, while the quantity of the finest lumber, and the\r\nfacilities for transporting it are superior. The fish taken in its lakes\r\nare excellent and abundant; its people are enterprising and intelligent;\r\nand its State authorities have established one of the best Universities\r\nin the Union. Its future promises to become equal at least to that of the\r\nmost favored State.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Michigan was changed into a State preliminarily June\r\n15, 1836, and was fully admitted to an equality with all the States\r\nJanuary 26, 1837, making the twenty-fifth State (Arkansas was admitted\r\non the same day). Her area is 56,243 square miles, equal to 35,995,520\r\nacres. The population in 1870 was 1,184,296, which entitles her to nine\r\nRepresentatives in Congress. By an act of 1866, Michigan was located in\r\nthe sixth judicial circuit; and forms two judicial districts, and has\r\nfour collection districts and four ports of entry, viz.: Detroit, Port\r\nHuron, Grand Haven, and Michilimackinac; also five ports of delivery (if\r\nthe President deem them necessary).\r\n\r\nThe capital is Lansing. The State election is held on the Tuesday after\r\nthe first Monday in November.

It\r\nremained a part of that territory until 1812, when the present State of\r\nLouisiana was admitted into the Union. The remainder of the territory\r\nwas then formed into the Missouri Territory, and so remained until 1821\r\nwhen Missouri was admitted into the Union, and Arkansas was erected\r\ninto a separate territory, bearing the present name. In 1836, a State\r\nconstitution was formed at Little Rock, and Arkansas became a State in\r\nthe Union. It constituted the twenty-sixth State. It has an area of\r\n52,193 square miles, equal to 33,406,720 acres. The population in 1870\r\nwas 483,197, which entitles her to four Representatives in Congress. The\r\neastern portion of the State, extending back one hundred miles from the\r\nMississippi, is generally a vast plain covered with marshes, swamps, and\r\nlagoons. The Ozark mountains which enter the northwest part of the State\r\ndivide it into two unequal parts, of which the northern has the climate\r\nand productions of the Northern States, while the southern portion,\r\nin climate and productions, resembles Mississippi and Louisiana. The\r\nlowlands of Arkansas are unhealthy, while the more elevated portions of\r\nthe State will compare favorably with the most healthful and invigorating\r\nportions of the Northwest. There is a great variety of soil in this\r\nState. While some portions, like the river bottoms, are exceedingly\r\nfertile, other parts are sterile and barren.\r\n\r\nThe staple products are Indian corn, cotton and live stock. Arkansas\r\ngives indications of rich mineral resources.\r\n\r\nThis State lies in the eighth judicial circuit, and forms two judicial\r\ndistricts, the eastern and western. It has no ports of entry or delivery.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the State is Little Rock. She holds her State election the\r\nfirst Monday in November. The Legislature meets but once in two years, on\r\nthe first Monday in January.

The\r\nfirst settlers (1564) became discouraged and returned; the second colony,\r\nestablished in 1566, was destroyed by the Spaniards. These founded a\r\nsettlement in 1565 at St. Augustine, which was the oldest town in the\r\nUnited States settled by Europeans. It remained in their hands until\r\n1763, when, by the terms of the “Peace of Paris,” it fell into the hands\r\nof the English. It was returned to Spain in 1783.\r\n\r\nIt was acquired from Spain by treaty made with the United States in\r\n1819, but the American authorities did not take possession until July,\r\n1821. The consideration given by our government was about five million\r\ndollars. It is a point running out from the Southeast border of our\r\nterritory, of but little elevation above the sea level, and swampy, but\r\ncovered with an exuberant growth of vegetation with a chain of lakes\r\nfrom south to north through the center. The warmth of the climate, where\r\nno winter is ever known, promotes the growth of the rarest and most\r\nbeautiful flowers; the clustering vines and dense foliage render its\r\nforests almost impenetrable, and its delicate mosses are the wonder and\r\ndelight of the naturalist; while the splendid plumage of its tropical\r\nbirds, flitting among the lemon and orange groves, laden at once with\r\nbud, flower and fruit, combine to add the scenery of the equatorial\r\nregions to the homely but more useful vegetable growth and beauty of\r\nour temperate zone. It is a resort of invalids during the rigors of the\r\nnorthern winter, its otherwise excessive heat being tempered by the sea\r\nbreezes from either side. With its marshes drained and its vegetable\r\ngrowth subdued and guided by the industrious agriculturist, its supply of\r\nthe fruits and other production of warm climates would be inexhaustible.\r\nIt is but partially settled, and its agricultural, commercial, and\r\nmanufacturing facilities but slightly developed. Its wealth of resources\r\nremain to reward the enterprise and industry of the future. The railroad\r\nconnections between its cities and other States furnish a sufficient\r\nbasis for improvement.\r\n\r\nFlorida was admitted into the Union, March 3, 1845; making the\r\ntwenty-seventh State. This State has an area of 59,268 square miles,\r\nequal to 37,931,520 acres. The population in 1870 amounted to 187,756.\r\nShe has two Representative in Congress.\r\n\r\nFlorida lies in the fifth judicial circuit, and forms two judicial\r\ndistricts; and has seven ports of entry—St. Augustine, Key West,\r\nApalachicola, Pensacola, Magnolia, St. John’s River, and Fernandina; and\r\ntwo ports of delivery—Palatka and Bay Port.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Tallahassee. The State election is held on the Tuesday\r\nafter the first Monday in November. The Legislature meets on the Tuesday\r\nafter the first Monday in January.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws is: “Be it enacted by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives of the State of Florida, in General Assembly\r\nconvened.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  David L.

The name of this State in the Indian tongue is said to mean “_This is\r\nthe Land._” Few States have a surface, soil, and position so uniformly\r\nexcellent for all their different sections. A high rolling prairie, well\r\ndrained by streams, of great fertility, and almost no sterile or waste\r\nland; beautiful to look upon in its alternations of rise and fall, of\r\nprairie, stream, and timber; bounded on its extremes by the two mighty\r\nbranches of the “Father of Waters,” with numerous smaller rivers hundreds\r\nof miles in length within its limits; its southern region underlaid by\r\na vast bed of coal, its northern rich in deposits of lead; a climate\r\nfree from the severity of Minnesota and Wisconsin winters, and from the\r\nintemperate heats of Missouri and Kentucky summers, it is a land to\r\nbe satisfied with; and justifies the picturesque name given it by its\r\nancient appreciative owners.\r\n\r\n2. It was first visited by Europeans in 1673. Marquette and Joliet,\r\ntwo French Jesuit missionaries, whom the vast magnitudes of the North\r\nAmerican continent seemed to stimulate like new wine, roamed alone\r\nover these immense distances, preserved by their characteristic French\r\ncordiality from the suspicion and hostility of the numerous warlike\r\nIndian tribes—who everywhere received them with hospitality, treated\r\nthem with respect, and dismissed them with assistance—passed, in that\r\nyear, down the Mississippi, and, landing a little above the mouth of the\r\nMoingona—which, from the similarity of sound, they corrupted into Des\r\nMoines, (Monk’s River)—they fearlessly followed an Indian trail fourteen\r\nmiles into the interior to an Indian village. Some tradition or prophecy\r\nhad forewarned the Indians of venerable white visitors, and they were\r\nreceived at once as expected and honored guests. The new religion they\r\nannounced, and the authority of the king of France which they proclaimed,\r\nraised no remonstrance or hostile feeling, and they were sent on their\r\nway down the river with the “Pipe of Peace.” The grand visions of the\r\nfuture entertained by these and other French explorers were never\r\nrealized by that nation. It was more than a hundred years later that the\r\nfirst settlement was made by Julian Du Buque on the site of the present\r\ncity of that name. He obtained a grant of 180,000 acres from the Indians,\r\nestablished a trading post, and worked the lead mines, with great profit;\r\nbut the time had not come for dispossessing the Indians, and almost fifty\r\nyears more passed before any other settlement was attempted.\r\n\r\n3. In 1832 the Winnebagoes, Sacs, and Foxes united under the Winnebago\r\nchief, Black Hawk, to invade and repossess the lands in Illinois which\r\nthey had ceded to the government. Gen. Atkinson met and defeated them\r\non the Upper Iowa, taking Black Hawk and his son prisoners. They were\r\ntaken east, kindly treated, and set at liberty; and in the following\r\nyear a treaty was made which ultimately extinguished the Indian title\r\nto the whole of Iowa, the Indians removing west of the Missouri. In the\r\nsame year a settlement was made at Burlington. The time for Iowa had\r\ncome. In 1834 it was joined to the Territory of Michigan, in 1837 was\r\nreorganized as part of the Wisconsin territory, and, in 1838, became a\r\nseparate territory with the capital at Burlington. March 3d, 1845, it was\r\nconditionally, and Dec. 28th, 1846, fully admitted into the Union as a\r\nSovereign State. In 1840 it had a population of over 40,000, in 1850 of\r\nnearly 200,000. A steady growth followed, and she has now, probably, a\r\nmillion and a half of inhabitants. Four parallel lines of railroad pass\r\nentirely across the State from east to west, three from north to south,\r\nand various others are in process of building or form intersecting lines.\r\nShe is scarcely yet fully launched into her career of greatness. When her\r\nvirgin soil shall all be broken up and its hidden wealth evoked by her\r\nintelligent and skillful agriculturists, when the full tide of commerce\r\non her two great rivers shall have set in to supplement her railroads,\r\nand mature organization shall have made all her resources available, she\r\nwill take her proper place in the first rank of States in the Union,\r\nand her citizens will repeat with satisfaction and pride the Indian\r\ndeclaration, “This is the Land.”\r\n\r\nIowa was the twenty-eighth State, on its admission, in 1845. It has an\r\narea of 55,045 square miles, equal to 35,228,800 acres. The population\r\nin 1870 was 1,191,802, which entitles her to nine Representatives in\r\nCongress. This State lies in the eighth judicial circuit, and makes\r\none judicial district. She has no port of entry, but has three ports\r\nof delivery, to-wit: Burlington, Keokuk, and Dubuque; all of which are\r\nattached to the collection district of New Orleans, in the State of\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nDes Moines is the capital. The State election is held on the second\r\nTuesday of October. The Legislature meets biennially on the second Monday\r\nin January.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of her laws is in these words: “Be it enacted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the State of Iowa.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  George W.

The first\r\nsettlement in Texas was made on Matagorda bay, under the French led by La\r\nSalle, in 1685. It passed into the possession of the Spanish in the year\r\n1690.\r\n\r\nAfter the independence of Mexico, in 1822, Texas remained a Mexican\r\nprovince until the revolution of 1836, when it gained its independence.\r\nIt continued an independent republic, modeled on the United States, until\r\n1845, when, the Texan Congress having accepted the conditions imposed by\r\nthe Congress of the United States, it became the 29th State in the Union.\r\nIt has an area of 237,504 square miles, equal to 152,002,560 acres. The\r\npopulation in 1870 was 797,500, which entitles her to six members of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThis State embraces every variety of surface; mountain, plain, hill, and\r\ndesert waste lie within its limits. The climate is free from the extremes\r\nof both the temperate and torrid zones, producing, in the north, many\r\nof the products of the temperate, and in the south many of those of the\r\ntorrid zone. The variation in the temperature from the season of winter\r\nto that of summer is quite small, giving the State as equable a climate\r\nas any in the world. While it shares the genial climate of the “sunny\r\nSouth” it is free from all the deadly swamp exhalations of the lower\r\nMississippi States. The soil, on the whole, is as fertile as any in the\r\nworld. It furnishes the very best natural pasture all the year round.\r\nCotton in large quantities—Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats and other small\r\ngrains—tobacco, indigo and rice, are the staple products. The grape,\r\nmulberry and the vanilla, are indigenous and abundant. Cayenne pepper\r\nis grown in vast quantities. Fruit is no less various and abundant than\r\nits other products. The peach, nectarine, fig, plum, quince and a great\r\nvariety of berries flourish here. Oranges, lemons, limes and melons,\r\ngrow well. Live stock of all varieties and in vast numbers fatten on the\r\nplains, and are shipped in all directions to supply every demand.\r\n\r\nTexas abounds in minerals. Rich silver mines are already worked\r\nsuccessfully at San Saba. Gold in small quantities has been found west of\r\nthe Colorado river. Coal is abundant. Iron is found in many parts of the\r\nState. There are also salt lakes and salt springs, copper, alum, lime,\r\nagates, chalcedony, jasper and a white and red sandstone.\r\n\r\nTexas lies in the fifth judicial circuit, and makes two judicial\r\ndistricts, the eastern and the western. There are three collection\r\ndistricts in the State. The respective ports of entry for these districts\r\nare Galveston, La Salle, and Brazos Santiago. To these are attached nine\r\nports of delivery.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Austin. The Legislature is composed of a Senate, elected\r\nfor four years, and a House of Representatives, elected for two years.\r\nThe sessions of the Legislature are biennial and are held in December.\r\nThe Governor is elected for four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Thomas F.

This State was visited and crossed by the early French explorers about\r\n1665, and a settlement was made at Green Bay in 1669 and soon after\r\non the Mississippi, at Prairie du Chien. It was the policy of these\r\nenterprising men to connect the French settlements on the lower St.\r\nLawrence by a chain of stations on the lakes and rivers with the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi. This would have passed through the heart of the country\r\nand have laid open its chief resources at once. It was a bold conception.\r\nWe see it nowhere among the English explorers and settlers, who seemed\r\nnot to like to lose sight of their ships; but it is quite in keeping with\r\nthe grand and rapid genius of the French; and, as in so many other cases,\r\nby attempting too much they lost the whole. The English, if slower, were\r\nsure, and consolidated their possessions on the coast, gradually pushing\r\nwestward as they were able to hold their ground.\r\n\r\n2. The French explorers have left traces of their untiring activity in\r\nthe names of rivers and places, and even Indian tribes, but the attention\r\nof their home government was soon withdrawn from them. No further\r\nextension was given to settlement for near 150 years, notwithstanding it\r\nwas so easy of access from the south by the Mississippi river, and from\r\nthe east by the chain of great lakes. Very fortunately, as it now seems,\r\nall this vast and valuable territory in the heart of the continent,\r\nequal, perhaps in its natural wealth, to the original resources of the\r\nwhole of Europe, was reserved to reward the labors and consolidate the\r\nbeneficent power of a Nation of Freemen, carefully trained and adapted to\r\ntheir high destiny.\r\n\r\n3. The tide of emigration flowed westward by way of the Ohio river, and\r\nthe States south were settled and admitted into the Union long before\r\nWisconsin received even a Territorial government. This occurred in 1836,\r\nand in 1840 the census gave it but little over 30,000 inhabitants.\r\nPopulation now flowed steadily to it and we find, in 1850, over 300,000\r\ninhabitants. It was admitted into the Union in 1848, making the thirtieth\r\nState. Its high latitude probably had something to do with this deferred\r\nsettlement, the milder winters of the more southern range of States\r\nattracting the emigrants first. The climate, however, has important\r\nadvantages over the States in question, being drier, less changeable, and\r\nnot so subject to extremes. It is very healthy, and probably the oldest\r\nman in the country was living, hale and hearty, in this State, a few\r\nyears ago, at the patriarchal age of 139. The climate is milder than in\r\nthe same latitude farther east.\r\n\r\n4. The surface is a high rolling prairie, open and mostly treeless,\r\nexcept near streams and bodies of water in the south, but in the north\r\ncovered with timber. Vast forests of pine grow on the northern slope,\r\nwhich is some 1,200 feet above the level of the sea. Some parts of the\r\nState fall 600 feet below that elevation; and a succession of ridges\r\nhaving a general direction east and west, separate the rivers flowing\r\ninto Lake Superior, Green Bay, and Lake Michigan, while many streams\r\nflow southwest into the Mississippi. The State is 285 miles long by 255\r\nwide. Its beautiful prairies, gratefully returning a bountiful harvest\r\nto the intelligent farmer; its numerous charming lakes and ponds; its\r\nremarkable commercial advantages by lakes and rivers, supplemented by\r\ncanals and railroads; its great manufacturing facilities, and valuable\r\nmineral deposits, give great promise to its future. Wheat is the leading\r\nagricultural staple, but all the grains, vegetables, and fruits of the\r\nNorthern States well reward cultivation. It has an area of 52,924 square\r\nmiles, equal to 34,511,360 acres. In 1870 the population amounted to\r\n1,055,167, which gave her eight Members of Congress. Wisconsin lies in\r\nthe seventh judicial circuit (which is composed of Wisconsin, Indiana\r\nand Illinois,) and forms one judicial district. It has one collection\r\ndistrict, one port of entry (Milwaukee,) and five ports of delivery,\r\nviz.: Southport, Racine, Sheboygan, Green Bay and Depere.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the State is Madison. The Legislature meets on the second\r\nWednesday in January. The State election is on the Tuesday after the\r\nfirst Monday in November.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of her laws is as follows: “The people of Wisconsin,\r\nrepresented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Henry Dodge,          from  1848  to  1857.\r\n  Isaac P.

The first mission was\r\nfounded by Spanish Catholics in 1769. It was sparsely settled by Mexican\r\nrancheros, who occupied themselves chiefly in raising cattle. In 1846\r\nFremont, who had been conducting an exploring party across the great\r\nplains and the Rocky Mountains, defeated in conjunction with Commodore\r\nStockton, the Mexican forces in California, and took possession of it in\r\nthe name of the United States; to which it was definitely ceded by the\r\ntreaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Feb. 2nd, 1848; the United States government\r\npaying Mexico for that territory and New Mexico $15,000,000, besides\r\npaying $3,500,000 indemnity, due from Mexico to citizens of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nScarcely had this arrangement been made, when it was published that\r\nCalifornia was rich in gold, and adventurers from all sections of the\r\nUnion, and various countries of the Old World, rushed in like a flood.\r\nFor some years, society there, composed in large part, of the wildest\r\nand most ungovernable elements of old communities, was like a seething\r\nvolcano; but, to the immortal honor of American citizens, it was subdued\r\nby the superior resolution and summary vigor of the better class of\r\nemigrants from the States, and was admitted into the Union on the 7th of\r\nSept. 1850, with a clause in its Constitution prohibiting slavery. The\r\ndiscussion in Congress on this point came near precipitating the Civil\r\nWar that broke out ten years later. The difficulty between the slavery\r\nand anti-slavery parties was adjusted by compromise measures, for the\r\ntime, but only served to allay the agitation produced by conflict of\r\ninterests and opinions, which was irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nCalifornia “The Golden,” proved extraordinarily rich in precious metals\r\nand other minerals, as quicksilver, platinum, asphaltum, iron, lead, and\r\nrare qualities of marble. Its gold mines alone from 1858 to 1868 produced\r\nover $800,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is a broken country, traversed by two ranges of mountains. The valleys\r\nare exceedingly productive. They are unexcelled for wheat; all kinds of\r\nfruit grow in the greatest perfection; and the grape culture promises\r\nto equal, if not to excel, the products of the most famous vineyards\r\nof Europe. Surprising as is her mineral wealth, her agricultural\r\npossibilities are far greater, and her commerce is already immense, and\r\nbids fair, from her position and relations to Eastern Asia, and the\r\nwestern parts of South America, to rival that of the Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nThe world was ripe for the discovery of these unparalleled treasures,\r\nand civilization was prepared to use them for the good of mankind. The\r\nready passage across the vast and inhospitable deserts of the American\r\ncontinent, by means of railways, has already changed (and will probably\r\nchange still more in the future) the course of commerce; and San\r\nFrancisco and New York may hope to rule, in large part, the commerce of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nCalifornia is remarkable for the salubrity of its climate, where the\r\nrigors of winter (save on the mountains), and the excessive heats of\r\nsummer are equally unknown, and for the variety and magnitude of its\r\nnatural curiosities. Of the last the Yosemite valley and the Big Trees\r\nare the most prominent. She has near 1,000 miles of railroad, and has\r\nmade ample provision for education.\r\n\r\nCalifornia was the thirty-first State. It has an area of 188,982 square\r\nmiles, equal to 120,948,480 acres. The population in 1870 was 560,285,\r\nentitling her to four Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nBy act of 1866, this State, with Oregon and Nevada, constitutes the ninth\r\njudicial circuit, and forms two judicial districts. California has seven\r\nports of entry, viz.: San Francisco, Monterey, San Diego, Sacramento,\r\nSonoma, San Joaquin and San Pedro; also, one port of delivery, Santa\r\nBarbara. California was obtained from Mexico by conquest in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Sacramento. She holds her State election on the first\r\nTuesday in September. Her Legislature meets on the first Monday in\r\nDecember, but meets only once in two years.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of her laws is: “The people of the State of\r\nCalifornia, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  John C.

The head waters\r\nof the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the streams flowing into the\r\nfrozen ocean of the north are all found here. In 1680 the unwearied La\r\nSalle visited the head waters of the Mississippi, but this region was\r\nlong left to the sole occupation of the Indians.\r\n\r\nFort Snelling, near St. Paul, was built in 1819. No other territory was\r\nacquired, by extinction of the Indian title to the soil, until 1837; and\r\nin 1849 the civilized population gathered about the trading posts and\r\nmissions amounted to less than 5,000. It then received a Territorial\r\ngovernment. A considerable portion of the State having in 1851 been\r\nceded, by treaty with the Indians, to the government, was immediately\r\nentered on by the settlers; and in 1858 it was prepared to take rank\r\namong the sovereign States. It was admitted in May of this year, by act\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the State passed through the appalling crisis of an Indian\r\nmassacre of the outlying settlements. It began without warning, in the\r\nmidst of fancied security, and before adequate protection could be\r\nforwarded, some 500 men, women, and children were murdered with all\r\nthe accompaniments of savage cruelty. Some $3,000,000 of property was\r\ndestroyed. In a short time sufficient force was gathered to overpower the\r\nsavages, and they were in large part removed from the State.\r\n\r\nThe surface is undulating and high, and the soil, in good part, extremely\r\nfertile. Portions are open and rolling prairie; the remainder heavily\r\nwooded. Though the winters are long and cold, the air is dry and\r\ninvigorating, and the climate healthy. It is specially favorable to\r\nthe growth of wheat. Commerce is favored by the Mississippi, navigable\r\nto St. Paul, and by good harbors on Lake Superior, as well as by\r\nnumerous railways. Its provision for education is excellent, and a State\r\nUniversity at St. Anthony’s Falls promises to form a suitable crown to\r\nits intellectual advantages.\r\n\r\nThis State was admitted into the Union on the 11th day of May, 1858, and\r\nmade the thirty-second State. It has an area of 83,531 square miles,\r\nequal to 53,459,840 acres. The population in 1870 amounted to 435,511.\r\nThis State is entitled to three Members of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt lies in the eighth judicial circuit, which is composed of Missouri,\r\nIowa, Kansas, Arkansas and Minnesota. Minnesota forms one judicial\r\ndistrict, and has no ports of entry or delivery.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul is the capital. The Legislature meets annually on the Tuesday\r\nafter the first Monday in November.

Grey, of Boston, discovered the Columbia river and entered it,\r\nsecuring the sovereignty of the country to the United States by right\r\nof first exploration. It was more thoroughly explored by Lewis and\r\nClark, appointed for that purpose by the United States government, in\r\n1804-5-6. The northern part, (now Washington Territory,) was claimed by\r\nGreat Britain, and the conflicting claims produced long and dangerous\r\ndiplomatic contention, which was finally peaceably ended in favor of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 a fur trading company established a fort and settlement at the\r\nmouth of the Columbia, which was taken possession of by the English\r\nin the latter part of 1813. The country was claimed by them until\r\n1846, when the boundaries were settled by treaty; giving Oregon to the\r\nUnited States. Settlement from the States, however, commenced in 1839,\r\nand continued to increase until 1848, when a territorial government\r\nwas organized. The excitement consequent on the discovery of gold in\r\nCalifornia drew off many of its citizens; but was, in part, counteracted\r\nby the extraordinary inducements made to actual settlers. A State\r\nconstitution was adopted by the people Nov. 9th, 1857, but it was not\r\nadmitted, by act of Congress, into the Union, until Feb. 14th, 1859,\r\nmaking the thirty-third State.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the country is divided by three ranges of mountains, the\r\nCascade, Blue and Rocky mountains. The Cascade Range has the highest\r\npeaks found in the United States. The climate is mild near the coast,\r\nbut more severe in higher eastern parts. The high eastern regions are\r\nvolcanic, containing vast tracts of lava, entirely sterile; the middle\r\nis well adapted to grazing, in many parts. The valuable farming lands\r\nare in the western division, along the various tributary streams of the\r\nColumbia. Wheat is the great staple; rye, oats, and vegetables, are grown\r\nwith success. Fruit is also produced in abundance. Its supply of coal and\r\ncopper is said to be unlimited; and it is specially celebrated for its\r\nextensive forests of gigantic trees. Manufactures and commerce are, as\r\nyet, undeveloped; but will be important in the future. Little has been\r\ndone in the way of internal improvement.\r\n\r\nOregon has experienced the disadvantage of growing up in the shade of her\r\nsplendid neighbor, California, but has a solidly prosperous future before\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt has an area of 95,274 square miles, equal to 60,975,360 acres. The\r\npopulation amounted in 1870 to 90,922, which did not reach the number\r\nrequired to entitle it to a Member of Congress according to the fixed\r\nratio. But every State is entitled to one member, whatever its population\r\nmay be. By act of 1866, the States of Oregon, Nevada and California\r\nwere constituted the ninth judicial circuit. Oregon forms one judicial\r\ndistrict, and has one collection district, and one port of entry.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Salem, where her Legislature meets once in two years, on\r\nthe second Monday of September.

Nearly every State in the American Union has some advantage that\r\nis peculiar to it, or that it shares in a degree so eminent as to\r\ndistinguish it from all others. Kansas is not an exception, and some of\r\nthese are exceedingly attractive. They enter, to some extent, into the\r\npainful and bloody history of its first settlement; the mighty tragedy\r\nof the Civil War having enacted its prelude on her fertile plains. The\r\nKansas and Nebraska Bill, in 1854, repealed the Missouri Compromise, and\r\nthis territory was opened to a trial of strength between Freedom and\r\nSlavery; the contest being transferred from the floors of Congress and\r\nthe Representatives of the people to the settlers of the soil, who were\r\nto determine whether slavery should, or not, exist in it, as a State.\r\nThe attraction of a decisive political struggle was added to the many\r\nfavorable features of position, climate, and intrinsic value. Southern\r\npeople sought to introduce their peculiar institution, and northern\r\npeople resisted. There was much disorder and bloodshed. Every effort\r\nwas made, by strategy and force, on the one side and the other. The\r\nsouthern party was signally defeated and there was henceforth no hope\r\nof preserving to the slave States a balance of power in the national\r\ngovernment, and the civil war followed, almost as a natural consequence.\r\n\r\n2. Kansas is larger by more than 3,000 square miles than the whole of\r\nNew England. It lies very near the geographical centre of the country,\r\nand stretches a friendly hand, by the Pacific Railroads, to both the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific States. A good part of her soil is declared to\r\nbe much superior to that of ordinary prairie land in richness, and\r\nto average four feet in depth. It is fairly watered and timbered, and\r\nfreely produces everything, except the proper tropical products of\r\nthe extreme south, that is grown in the United States. The climate is\r\nthat of Virginia, without its excessive heat; which may, perhaps, be\r\nconsidered balanced by its occasional excessively sharp and cutting\r\nwinds in winter. These, however, are tolerably rare, and the winters,\r\nfor the most part, short and mild, the climate being, on the whole very\r\nhealthy. Its deposits of salt are exceedingly rich, and other minerals\r\nabound in various parts. Its commercial position is excellent, and\r\nits manufacturing capabilities all that the future will be likely to\r\nrequire. Its resources, under suitable development, cannot be considered\r\ninferior to any other equal area in the country; which is speaking in the\r\nstrongest language we can command, considering what may be said of so\r\nmany different localities.\r\n\r\n3. The eastern surface is a succession of waves, or undulations, the\r\nvalleys generally extending north and south. A narrow section west of\r\nit, stretching across the State is more level and the soil lighter.\r\nBeyond this long reaches of level, fertile, and well watered lands\r\nare adapted to flocks and herds. These are much higher than the river\r\nbeds, the valleys of which abound in bottoms, beautiful in appearance\r\nand situation, and of inexhaustible fertility. Vast beds of coal, a\r\ngood quality and abundant quantity of iron ore, and petroleum and lead\r\nhave been discovered. Corn and wheat are the leading staples, and it is\r\nbelieved that fruit culture will soon become a leading interest of this\r\npromising State.\r\n\r\nKansas was admitted into the Union as a State, Jan. 29, 1861, making the\r\nthirty-fourth State. Kansas has an area of 78,841 square miles, equal\r\nto 50,187,520 acres. The population in 1870 was 362,812, giving her\r\nthree Representatives in Congress. This State is in the eighth judicial\r\ncircuit, and forms one judicial district. It has no ports of entry or\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nTopeka is the capital. The State election is held on the Tuesday after\r\nthe first Monday in November. The Legislature meets on the second Tuesday\r\nin January.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted by the\r\nLegislature of the State of Kansas.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  James Henry Lane,     from  1861  to  1866.\r\n  Samuel C.

The interests of West Virginia were\r\nalways different from those of the eastern part; and when, at the\r\ncommencement of the Civil War, the eastern part seceded, the western\r\nremained loyal and was erected into a separate State; thus realizing the\r\nancient wish of its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress organizing it as a State was passed December\r\n31st, 1862, with condition that it should take effect 60 days after\r\nproclamation of its admission by the President of the United States.\r\nThis proclamation was issued April 21st, 1863; and it was admitted to\r\nrepresentation in Congress as a sovereign State June 20th thereafter. A\r\ntemporary government without representation in Congress had been formed\r\nin May, 1862. It was the thirty-fifth State admitted into the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is varied in surface, from high mountain ranges, hilly and undulating\r\nmidlands, to level and rich river bottoms; and is nearly all available\r\neither for cultivation or grazing; while its valuable deposits of coal\r\nlie very near the surface in nearly all parts of the State. Iron abounds,\r\nand timber of the best quality. Its manufacturing facilities are great;\r\nand its canals and railroads, with the Ohio river on its northwestern\r\nborder, furnish the means of making it one of the richest States in the\r\nUnion. The climate is healthy, and the scenery picturesque, and in places\r\nit rises to wild grandeur.\r\n\r\nIt has an area of 23,000 square miles, or 14,720,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe population, in 1870 was 445,616. This State has now three Members of\r\nCongress. West Virginia was subsequently put into the fourth judicial\r\ncircuit, and constitutes one judicial district. Parkersburg, also, was\r\nmade a port of delivery.\r\n\r\nCharleston is the capital. The State election is held on the fourth\r\nThursday in October. The Legislature meets on the second Tuesday in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Peter G. Van Winkle,  from  1863  to  1869.\r\n  Waitman T.

It lies in\r\nthe western part of the basin of the Great Salt Lake and among those\r\nmountains, in whose rocky bosom was found the stimulus that has changed\r\nso much of the Pacific slope, and the Rocky Mountain region, from a wild\r\nand dismal waste to populous and thriving States.\r\n\r\nGold was found in moderate quantities among the mountains, and population\r\nbegan to scatter slowly over them about 1850, and soon settlers began\r\nto improve the valleys at the foot of the mountains on the east for\r\nagricultural purposes. Carson county was organized by the territorial\r\ngovernment of Utah in 1854; but in June, 1859, rich deposits of silver\r\nwere found; and emigration began to pour in rapidly. In March, 1861, the\r\nTerritory of Nevada was organized, and the same month, three years later,\r\nit was admitted into the Union, making the thirty-sixth State.\r\n\r\nThe history of these States, so rich in precious metals, puts to the\r\nblush the fantastic fables of the Arabian Nights. The silver mines of\r\nNevada are believed to be the richest in the world. The celebrated silver\r\nmines of Potosi, in South America, never produced over $10,000,000 a\r\nyear, while in 1867, one mine in Nevada produced $17,500,000, and is\r\nthought to be almost, or quite, inexhaustible. The climate, like that of\r\nCalifornia, is healthy; the seasons are divided into wet and dry, and\r\nagriculture is dependent on irrigation. With time and pains its products\r\nwill be considerable. It has much wild and sublime scenery, and some\r\nnatural curiosities; as Lake Mono, with its waters so sharply acid as to\r\ndestroy cloth and leather immersed in it. Its gloomy surroundings, and\r\nthe great distance from the tops of the precipitous rocks surrounding\r\nits shores to the surface of the water lend an impressive and fearful\r\ncharacter to its severe desolation. It lies below the reach of the winds,\r\nand no living thing can exist in its waters.\r\n\r\nIt has an area of 63,473 square miles, or 40,622,720 acres. The\r\npopulation in 1860, while yet a Territory, was 6,857. In 1870 it had\r\nincreased to 42,491. In conformity with the Constitutional provision that\r\nevery State shall have one Representative in Congress, Nevada has one.\r\nThis State lies in the ninth judicial circuit, and forms one judicial\r\ndistrict, called the district of Nevada.\r\n\r\nCarson City is the capital. The State election is held on the first\r\nTuesday in November; and the Legislature meets on the first Monday in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nThe enacting clause of the laws is in the following words: “The people\r\nof the State of Nevada, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as\r\nfollows.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  James W.

It received a Territorial government in 1854, and was, by the\r\nprovisions of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, equally with Kansas, exposed\r\nto the introduction of slavery; but the Southern people limited their\r\nefforts in that direction to Kansas, and Nebraska did not share in its\r\ndisorder and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n2. The greater portion of the country consists of a high, rolling\r\nprairie. The soil in the eastern part of the State is nearly the same as\r\nthat of the adjoining portions of Iowa and Kansas. It is a rich loam,\r\nfinely pulverized, and admirably adapted to cultivation. The second\r\ndistrict, near the center of the State, is strictly pastoral. The third,\r\nor western section, has a fair soil, but is destitute of timber, and\r\ninsufficiently supplied with water.\r\n\r\nThroughout the fertile portion of the State, wheat, corn, oats, and other\r\ncereals, and vegetables and fruits yield largely. Vast herds of buffaloes\r\nformerly roamed over its prairies; but they are now mostly exterminated.\r\nThe altitude of Nebraska secures to it a dry, pure, and salubrious\r\natmosphere. Rain is not abundant, but, in the eastern part, is sufficient\r\nfor the purposes of the agriculturist. Salt, limestone, and coal are\r\nfound in various localities, and not improbably other minerals will be\r\nfound in paying quantities. The State is too new to fully estimate all\r\nits resources and capabilities.\r\n\r\n3. The educational advantages are good. The Common School System, modeled\r\non that of Ohio, is well supplied with funds, embracing one-sixteenth of\r\nthe public land, or 2,500,000 acres. 90,000 acres were given to endow a\r\nState Agricultural College, and 46,081 acres to the State University.\r\n\r\nIts commercial facilities are supplied by the Missouri River, the Pacific\r\nand other railroads, and are amply sufficient to develop its resources.\r\nThe future of the State has many elements of promise. No public debt\r\nimpedes its growth, and within the last few years it has increased in\r\nwealth and population more rapidly than any of the adjoining States or\r\nTerritories. An unknown, but certainly not limited, amount of wealth\r\nstill lies locked up in its soil, and its relation to ocean commerce\r\nby the mighty Missouri, and to inter-State trade by lying in the great\r\ntraveled route between the Atlantic and Pacific States, with a remarkably\r\nfine, healthy climate, and the ease with which its soil is worked,\r\ncontribute to form a powerful attraction to labor and capital, and we\r\nhave no reason to suspect any decrease in its rapid progress.\r\n\r\n4. On its admission, in 1867, it was the thirty-seventh State. It has an\r\narea of 122,007 square miles, or 78,084,480 acres.\r\n\r\nPopulation in 1870, 123,000. It forms the ninth judicial district, and\r\nhas no ports of entry or delivery.\r\n\r\nThe capital is Lincoln. The State election is held on the second Tuesday\r\nin October. The Legislature meets on the Thursday after the first Monday\r\nin January.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  John M. Thayer,       from  1867  to  1871.\r\n  Thomas W.

Its Territorial\r\ngovernment was organized by act of Congress, March 2nd, 1861. It\r\nis situated west of Kansas, on the great route from the Pacific to\r\nthe Atlantic States, and on the dividing ridge, or backbone, of the\r\ncontinent. The rivers that find their head waters within the territory\r\nrun southeast and south to the Gulf of Mexico, and southwest to the Gulf\r\nof California. The surface is nearly equally divided between a plain,\r\ngently descending from the abrupt mountain wall of rock constituting the\r\neastern flank of the Rocky Mountains, and the mighty mass of that chain,\r\nwith its peaks, rising nearly three miles above the surface of the sea,\r\nnow forming an elevated plateau, and again sending off spurs and lateral\r\nranges containing beautiful valleys, or, in a more lavish and genial\r\nmood, taking a wide circuit inclosing an immense sunken plain containing\r\nhundreds of square miles of charming, well watered farming land called\r\nparks. Of these there are seven. It is a magnificent region, and contains\r\nall the elements of extreme mineral and agricultural wealth. It has mines\r\nof gold, silver, copper, lead, and iron. Coal abounds in all parts, oil\r\nflows from the wells with a little encouragement, and salt is easily\r\nobtained in some parts. An immense soda-fountain is found near Colorado\r\nCity, called Fontaine qui Bouille (boiling fountain) and there are\r\nindications of cinnabar, platina, and precious stones.\r\n\r\nThe climate is fine, the general temperature like Southern Pennsylvania\r\nor Maryland; and, from the elevation, the air is very dry and pure. The\r\nplain rises by imperceptible degrees to 5,000 feet, (about one mile,)\r\nabove the level of the sea, at the foot of the mountains. The numerous\r\nvalleys, the parks, and much of the sloping plain, form as fine an\r\nagricultural region, with proper irrigation, as any State possesses, and\r\nmuch of the remainder furnishes excellent pasturage through the entire\r\nyear. Occasionally heavy snow falls and for a few days extreme cold\r\nprevails, but these are exceptional years; and it does not lie long. Its\r\neffects can be guarded against with prudent care. Corn, wheat, and other\r\nsmall grains and vegetables reach their greatest perfection here.\r\n\r\nIt furnishes excellent manufacturing facilities along the unfailing\r\nmountain streams in the valleys, and will no doubt ultimately unite with\r\nMontana and Southwestern Dacotah to supply the immense central part of\r\nour domain with all the products of manufacturing genius and skill.\r\n\r\nDenver the capital and principal city, is situated near the eastern base\r\nof the mountains, where these put on their severest and sublimest aspect.\r\nClear lakes are set like stars, here and there, and the beautiful and\r\ngrand in scenery are nowhere more striking, or more agreeably combined.\r\n\r\nThe Territory contains 106,475 square miles in area, and the population\r\nin 1870 numbered 29,706.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to obtain the admission of Colorado as\r\na State into the American Union. An act to enable the people to form a\r\nconstitution and State Government was passed by Congress, March, 1864.\r\nThe constitution, framed under this act, was rejected by the people of\r\nthe territory. Another constitution was framed and adopted in 1865, but a\r\nbill, passed by Congress for its admission, was vetoed by the President.\r\nAnother attempt made in 1867 likewise failed by the President’s veto;\r\nsince which time it quietly remained under its Territorial government,\r\nuntil March 3, 1875, when it was admitted by Act of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nMOTTOES AND NAMES OF THE STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES—_E Pluribus Unum_, “Out of Many, One.”\r\n\r\nALABAMA—Has no motto.

When the War of Independence closed, and the people and government\r\nhad leisure to look about them and estimate their situation, they found\r\nthe organized States covering the coast from Nova Scotia to Florida,\r\n(then in possession of Spain.) There was no vacant territory near the\r\nocean; but west of the States—which run back only a few hundred miles—was\r\na vast region, peopled by a few tribes of Indians and, in Kentucky and\r\nTennessee, by a few hundred whites. These with singular hardihood and\r\nself reliance, had not hesitated to brave a thousand perils to get\r\npossession of the charming valleys and fertile savannahs of the eastern\r\npart of the great Mississippi Valley. The settlements were made near the\r\nmountains that skirted the western boundaries of the original States.\r\nBeyond, to the Mississippi river, extended as beautiful and fertile a\r\nterritory as any land could boast; many times larger than the original\r\nterritory, whose people, poor and few as they were, had fought for and\r\nwon it by persistent bravery. It lay in virgin beauty and wealth, the\r\nprize of their strong hands and courageous hearts. The future of the new\r\ngovernment once determined, and the fundamental Law of the Land adopted,\r\nthey prepared to take possession by organizing a government over those\r\nalready there, surveying and laying off the unsettled lands, and bringing\r\nthem into market for sale and settlement.\r\n\r\n2. The States had owned all the property, and held all the real power,\r\nup to the adoption of the present Constitution. It was now agreed that\r\nthe unsettled lands should be considered as the common property of\r\nthe whole country, and be administered by the General Government. It\r\nwas not without much difficulty, and many severe contests, that this\r\npoint was so settled. There were two parties; one headed by Alexander\r\nHamilton who wished a strong, consolidated central government; the other,\r\nafraid to confer on it too much power lest it should prove a tyrannical\r\nmaster, wished to preserve most of the substance of power in the State\r\ngovernments. They were led by Thomas Jefferson. The adoption of the\r\nConstitution was difficult, and the struggle over it perilous to the\r\nconfederation. It embraced the main views of the first party. But for the\r\npersonal influence of Washington, who had presided over the Convention\r\nthat framed it, and had, as it were, been its father, it could not have\r\nreceived the approval of the majority of the people. The people allowed\r\ntheir fears to be overruled by their trust in his wisdom and prudence.\r\n\r\nHe alone it has been believed could have put its machinery in successful\r\noperation; and the admirable manner in which the statesmen, in Congress\r\nand the executive offices, infused the spirit of freedom and moderation\r\ninto the administration, following in the lead of the revered “Father of\r\nhis Country,” settled it in the confidence and affections of the people.\r\n\r\n3. We have dwelt on this point because it is intimately related to the\r\norganization and government of the Territories, and to the provision\r\nmade for the increase of States. It was important that they should be\r\nin harmony with the original ones, and there were no means of securing\r\nthis and providing against the future growth of governments, differing\r\nfrom those of the original States, but by giving the central power a\r\ngeneral control over them. The Constitution conferred it on Congress.\r\nOhio, and all the territory north of the Ohio river, was obliged to\r\nwait till this point was settled, before it could be opened to the\r\nentrance of emigrants. This region was early erected into a separate\r\ngovernment, by Congress, called the Northwest Territory. The region\r\nsouth of the river was treated in the same manner a little later. In 1800\r\nthe Mississippi Territory was organized; thus covering all the ground\r\noriginally belonging to the New Republic. These were, as population\r\nincreased, divided into sections, of convenient size for the purpose of\r\nlocal self government, and states created as fast as the requisite number\r\nof citizens had collected within such limits; and the remainder continued\r\nunder the preliminary territorial rule.\r\n\r\n4. In 1802, the vast region west of the Mississippi was bought of the\r\nFrench government. This extended the National Domain from the mouth\r\nto the head waters of this river, and westward, north of the Spanish\r\npossessions, to the Pacific ocean. Many new States and Territories have\r\nbeen formed from it. The process of multiplication has not yet ceased in\r\nthis region. In 1819 Florida was purchased; a part of Mexico was obtained\r\nin 1848, and again in 1853; and the increase of territory continued by\r\nthe acquisition of Alaska in 1867. This policy has become, in a manner,\r\ntraditional, and it is not unlikely that it may be continued to some\r\nextent in the future.\r\n\r\n5. The government of the territories is established by act of Congress;\r\nthe President nominates and the Senate confirms the Governor, Secretary,\r\nand Judges of the courts; and Congress passes all the general laws for\r\nthe government of the inhabitants. A Territorial Legislature is elected\r\nby the inhabitants, which takes charge of all the local interests of\r\nthe Territory. All these laws and organizations are temporary, and pass\r\naway when a State government is founded. Commonly, an act of Congress\r\nauthorizes the election of Delegates to a Convention for framing a\r\nState Constitution; though the Territorial Government sometimes takes\r\nthe initiative. This constitution is then submitted to the popular vote\r\nof the citizens in the Territory; and if they favor it, presented to\r\nCongress for its approval. If it is in harmony with our usages, and\r\nrepublican principles, Congress accepts it, and, if the President does\r\nnot see cause to veto it, a new State has come into existence. In this\r\nmanner the number of the States has become nearly three times as numerous\r\nas at the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIVIDUAL TERRITORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe territories are here arranged in the order of seniority, the one\r\nwhich first received a territorial government taking the lead. The\r\nDistrict of Columbia is older than any of them as acknowledged National\r\nproperty, the Louisiana Purchase having been made since it was ceded to\r\nthe general Government; but it was the last to receive a territorial\r\norganization, Congress governing it directly without giving it\r\nrepresentation until 1871. It is placed last for that reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO\r\n\r\nWas visited at an early period by Spaniards, who, excited by the success\r\nof the followers of Cortez and Pizarro in discovering rich mines of gold\r\nand silver, sought the wealth in the dangers and hardships of travel\r\nwhich is more often, if more slowly, found as the reward of patient\r\ntoil. An expedition from Florida made the formidable overland journey to\r\nNew Mexico, in 1537; and another from Mexico, after visiting the Gila\r\nRiver, passed eastward beyond the Rio Grande in 1540. In 1581 its mineral\r\nwealth became known and a mission was attempted; but no settlement was\r\nmade until 1600, when formal possession was taken by an adequate army.\r\nThe missions now became very successful and the mines were worked.\r\nMany of the natives were considerably advanced in some of the arts of\r\ncivilization. In 1680 the natives revolted, from the severe servitude to\r\nwhich they were subjected, and drove the Spaniards out of the country.\r\nThey only recovered it in 1698. It was never very numerously peopled by\r\nwhites. In 1846 it was conquered by General Kearney, and in 1848 ceded to\r\nthe United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The difficulties\r\nof transportation and the wild and lawless character of the inhabitants\r\nhas prevented any extensive emigration to it by Americans. It is an\r\nelevated table-land, nearly 7,000 feet above the surface of the sea,\r\ncrossed by several ranges of mountains sometimes rising 10,000 feet above\r\nthe general surface of the country. The atmosphere is dry; little rain\r\nfalls; and agriculture is usually successful only with irrigation. In the\r\nvalleys, where this is employed, the fertility of the soil is marvelous.\r\nOften two crops are raised, on the same land, in the year. Wheat and\r\nother grains are raised in great perfection. Cotton is successful in\r\nsome parts, fruit can be raised in abundance, and the soil is said to be\r\nspecially favorable to the grape, the wine rivaling that of France.\r\n\r\nGold and silver abound, but the mines have never been effectively worked\r\nfor want of transportation and the requisite capital. Stock raising\r\nis a profitable occupation in this Territory. Much of the land unfit\r\nfor cultivation produces grass which cures in drying during the hot\r\nmonths, and preserves all its nutritious qualities. Sheep and mules are\r\nextensively raised. When the Pacific railroad shall open the country\r\nto immigration, and order, industry, and capital make the most of its\r\nresources, it will be ranked among the favored parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt has many natural curiosities, and much wild and beautiful scenery.\r\nThe length of the Rio Grande, in its windings in the Territory, is about\r\n1200 miles; and its valley from one to twelve miles wide. Its Territorial\r\ngovernment was organized in 1850. The population, in 1870, was 91,878.\r\nMany tribes of Indians roam over the territory and through Texas,\r\nArizona, and northern Mexico. Most of the people are Roman Catholics. It\r\nincludes an area of about 100,000 square miles. Every free white male\r\ninhabitant living in the territory at the time of its organization had\r\nthe right of suffrage, that right being regulated in other respects by\r\nits legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTAH\r\n\r\nWas formerly a part of the Mexican territory of Upper California, and\r\nwas acquired by the United States in 1848, by the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo. It was too distant, desolate, and dangerous a region for much\r\nsettlement by Mexicans, and has little known history anterior to the\r\nexplorations of Fremont between 1843 and 1846.\r\n\r\nThe first American settlement was made by the Mormons, in July, 1847,\r\nand was supposed by them to be out of the territory of the United\r\nStates, and beyond the reach of possible interference. Here, in the\r\ndepths of the desert, they determined to build up a peculiar religious\r\nsociety embracing customs abhorrent to the views and institutions of\r\nmodern civilized States. Their success was a surprise to the world,\r\nand probably to themselves; the capacity of the depths of the Great\r\nAmerican Desert, as it was called, for cultivation, exceeding all\r\nprevious expectation. But the war with Mexico, then in progress, threw\r\nthis, before inaccessible, desert into the limits of the American Union;\r\nand the discovery of gold in the neighboring territory of California,\r\nthrowing them almost midway between the old western settlements and the\r\nnew Eldorado, subjected them to contact with, and interference by, the\r\ntide of modern civilization, as it flowed toward the setting sun; and in\r\nten years from their first appearance in the Great Central Basin of the\r\ncontinent, they came again into hostile conflict with the established\r\nauthorities they thought to have finally escaped. Though their conflict\r\nwith the United States government, imbued with the habits and prejudices\r\nwith which they antagonized, was deferred by the troubles which\r\nprecipitated the Civil War, and their institutions remained substantially\r\nintact until that was past; the Pacific Railroad was then built through\r\ntheir territory, and, if they are no longer persecuted, and their\r\npeculiarities opposed by deadly force, the moral influence and dissolving\r\npower introduced by numbers is more surely wasting away the foundations\r\nof their political and religious edifice.\r\n\r\nUtah was organized as a territory by act of Congress Sept. 9th, 1850.\r\nBrigham Young, the head of the Mormon church, became the first governor.\r\nIn 1854 it was vainly attempted to remove him; and in 1857 an army was\r\nsent to enforce Federal authority. A final conflict was avoided by\r\ncompromise. In 1862 the Mormons attempted to get admission into the Union\r\nas a State, with their “peculiar institutions,” but failed. A Territorial\r\nGovernment exists, but has little force, or vitality, while the Mormons\r\nare large in numbers. According to the habits of our people, conflict\r\nis avoided so far as possible, to await the more peaceable and natural\r\nsolution of the difficulty by moral forces.\r\n\r\nUtah is unique in one respect; though lying nearly a mile above the\r\nsurface of the sea, and having a complete system of lakes and rivers,\r\nthere is no visible connection of these with the ocean. It is a continent\r\nembosomed within the depths of a continent. The Great Salt Lake is 100\r\nmiles long by 50 broad, and its waters are very salt—three parts of the\r\nwater producing one of pure salt. No fish can live in it. It receives\r\nthe contents of many considerable streams. Whether they are kept in\r\nsubjection by evaporation alone, or have a concealed outlet to the ocean\r\nis unknown. The soil, though in its natural state an apparent desert, is\r\nextremely fertile when irrigated, and produces wheat and other cereals\r\nin great profusion. Its mountains are believed to be rich in silver and\r\ngold; but the Mormons have discouraged mining, and very little has been\r\ndone in that direction.\r\n\r\nCotton is highly successful in the southern settlements, and experiments\r\nwith flax and silk culture have been very favorable. The climate is mild\r\nand healthy.\r\n\r\nUtah is a highly promising section of our national domain. Its population\r\nin 1870 was 86,786; its area about 87,500 square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TERRITORY\r\n\r\nWas organized in 1853, and then contained a much larger area. It was at\r\nfirst a part of Oregon, and its meagre early history was the same. The\r\nStraits of San Juan de Fuca were visited and named by a Spanish navigator\r\nin 1775. The English government claimed the territory north of the\r\nColumbia and for some years there was a joint occupation by both nations\r\nby special agreement. The difficulties concerning this boundary came near\r\ninvolving the two nations in war, but it was settled in 1846, giving the\r\nUnited States the territory to the 49th parallel of latitude. Vancouver\r\nIsland was assigned to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWashington is estimated to contain, west of the Columbia river, where\r\nit flows down from British America, 22,000 square miles of arable land.\r\nThere is much that is adapted only to grazing, and vast quantities\r\ncovered with forests in the wild mountain regions of the eastern part of\r\nthe territory.\r\n\r\nIt has an almost inexhaustible supply of coal, and more or less of the\r\nprecious metals. The great distinction of Washington territory is its\r\nforests. The warm ocean currents from the Indian ocean, after traversing\r\nthe eastern coasts of Asia, are thrown across the North Pacific against\r\nthe western shores of North America, and effect an important modification\r\nin the severity and humidity of the temperature of our Pacific slope. The\r\nclimate is much milder and more equable than in the same latitude east\r\nof the mountains, and the moisture is highly favorable to forest growth.\r\nIt is the best ship building timber in the world. The trees are immense,\r\noften reaching a height of 300 feet with a diameter of 8 to 12 feet.\r\n\r\nThe portion of Washington territory lying west of the Cascade mountains\r\nis rich farming land, heavily timbered; while east of the Cascades the\r\ncountry is open prairie, well watered, with small and thinly wooded\r\nvalleys. The land immediately about Puget Sound is sandy, not valuable\r\nfor farming though producing timber, but a little way back is unrivaled\r\nin richness.\r\n\r\nCorn does not thrive well, but wheat, oats, potatoes, &c., are very\r\nprolific. Large quantities of butter, cheese, and wool are produced.\r\nThere is little snow in the winter and that soon melts away, except\r\nfar up in the mountains. Washington shares with Oregon the possession\r\nand use of the Columbia river. There are fine fisheries on the coast\r\nand excellent oysters, and these produce a considerable trade. Immense\r\nquantities of lumber are exported to all parts of the Pacific coast of\r\nboth North and South America, and even to Buenos Ayres on the South\r\nAtlantic. The French come here for their best and cheapest masts and\r\nspars. Thus we see that this corner of the Republic brings to the common\r\nstock of national treasures some of its best and most valuable material\r\nof wealth, and is prepared to whiten the Pacific with the sails of the\r\nunlimited commerce which is already beginning to grow up between us and\r\nthe Asiatics. Puget Sound can float with ease the navies of the world on\r\nits peaceful bosom. The Northern Pacific railroad will originate here,\r\nprobably, another great commercial emporium. Washington will, in due\r\ntime, become a great and wealthy State.\r\n\r\nIts area is about 70,000 square miles; and the population in 1870 was\r\n23,901.\r\n\r\n\r\nDACOTAH.\r\n\r\nThis territory received an organization and government in 1861. It\r\ncontains 240,000 square miles; and is greater in extent than all New\r\nEngland together with the great and wealthy States of New York and\r\nPennsylvania; and possesses some peculiar advantages.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri River passes from southeast to northwest diagonally through\r\nit, navigable for its whole length, a distance of more than a thousand\r\nmiles; the Red River of the North skirts its eastern line, its valley\r\nbeing unrivalled for its richness, and adaptation to the growth of wheat.\r\nExcept the extreme northern part it is said to have the dry, pure, and\r\nhealthy climate of Southern Minnesota, with the soil of Central Illinois.\r\n\r\nIt is free from the damp, raw, and chilly weather prevailing in Iowa and\r\nIllinois, and from the embarrassments to agriculture often experienced\r\nin these States from excessive spring rains; while, in late spring and\r\nearly summer, copious showers supply sufficient moisture to promote a\r\nrapid vegetable growth. The surface east and north of the Missouri is an\r\nundulating prairie, free from marsh, swamp, and slough, traversed by many\r\nstreams and dotted with innumerable lakes, of various sizes, whose woody\r\nand rocky shores and gravel bottoms supply the purest water, and lend the\r\nenchantment of extreme beauty to the landscape.\r\n\r\nIt has all the conditions of climate, soil, and transportation, for\r\nthe most profitable production of the two great staples of American\r\nagriculture, wheat and corn. West of the Missouri the country becomes\r\nmore rolling, then broken and hilly, until the lofty chain of the Rocky\r\nMountains is reached. These mountains cross the southwestern section. A\r\nmost desirable stock raising region is furnished here, and mining will\r\nflourish in the mountains. In 1870 it had a population of 14,181. Yankton\r\nis the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nARIZONA.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards visited the valley of the Colorado at an early day; but the\r\ndistance from Mexico, and the warlike character of the Indians, did not\r\nfavor settlement beyond what was gathered about the few missions that\r\nwere constructed so as to answer for fortresses.\r\n\r\nThe part of this territory lying between Sonora, (of which it formed\r\npart,) and California was acquired to the United States by the Gadsden\r\ntreaty, made with Mexico Dec. 30th, 1853. The American government paid\r\n$10,000,000 for it. A Territorial government was organized Feb. 24th,\r\n1863, and embraced part of New Mexico, containing, altogether, an area of\r\n121,000 square miles, or 77,440,000 acres.\r\n\r\nEfforts had been made previously to settle the country and develop\r\nits mines; and an overland mail stage route was established. This\r\nproved a success; but the fierce hostility of the Apache Indians, and\r\nthe desperate character of such whites as had gathered there, fleeing\r\nfrom justice in California and Sonora, discouraged the immigration of\r\nlaw-abiding citizens; and the breaking out of the Civil War withdrew the\r\nsoldiers in garrison there for the protection of the country. After the\r\nwar the main stream of emigration followed the line of the newly opened\r\nPacific railroad. The development of the mines required capital and\r\nmachinery and, though they are thought to be the richest in the world,\r\nnothing could be extracted from them by individuals without means. So the\r\npopulation has increased slowly, the census of 1870 giving 9,658.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange and somewhat fearful land; in great part a region of\r\ndesolate mountains and deep canons. There are many sections susceptible\r\nof cultivation that would produce immense returns under irrigation, but\r\nmost of the efforts in this direction have miscarried from the desolating\r\nravages of the Indians. The rainless season reduces the whole country to\r\nthe semblance of a desert. It is, however, declared to have more arable\r\nland in proportion to its surface than New Mexico, or California; and\r\nwill probably, in time, have a large and prosperous farming community.\r\nCotton is easily cultivated, and sugar cane, in the lower parts, produces\r\nabundantly. Grains, vegetables, and melons are produced in the greatest\r\npossible perfection, and mature in an incredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\nWhen the Apaches are subdued, and society is reduced to order, it will\r\nbecome a favorite resort of the thrifty farmers of the older States, and\r\nthe diligent German and other foreign immigrants.\r\n\r\nIt contains many traces of a race that has disappeared; some of their\r\ndwellings yet remaining in a partially ruinous state. They were probably\r\nAztecs, the race that ruled Mexico before the conquest by Cortez, or are\r\nmore ancient still. Hideous idols are found, and various indications of a\r\nbarbarous worship.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Southern Pacific railway will introduce the hum\r\nof industry among its desolate mountains and along its numerous fertile\r\nvalleys, and the acquisition of the mouth of the Colorado, a large\r\nriver opening into the head of the Gulf of California, will give it a\r\nprofitable commerce. Arizona lies south of Utah, to which it is superior\r\nin the number and size of its streams, its larger quantity of timber, and\r\nthe amount of rain-fall in some parts, which is deemed, in some sections,\r\nsufficient to dispense with the necessity of irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAHO.\r\n\r\nThis territory was organized March 3rd, 1863. It originally embraced\r\na vast territory lying on both sides of the main chain of the Rocky\r\nMountains; but the eastern portion has since been erected into the\r\nterritory of Montana. It has about 90,000 square miles of territory, and\r\nhad, in 1870, 14,998 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIdaho has very little history prior to the organization of its\r\nTerritorial government. Its chief attraction to settlers lies in its\r\nmines, as yet, and the population is floating, and, in large part, rough\r\nand sometimes disorderly. The difficulty of reaching it has prevented\r\nits rapid growth. It is exceedingly rich in the precious metals and this\r\nwill, in time, attract a large population. The eastern and northern\r\nparts are very mountainous, abounding in wild and striking scenery and\r\nin natural curiosities. The soil in the southern, central, and western\r\nparts, is fertile, producing wheat and other small grain, and vegetables\r\nvery successfully, but is unfavorable for corn from the late frosts of\r\nspring and the early cold of autumn. Snow falls to a great depth in the\r\nmountains; but the streams are numerous, and there is much choice farming\r\nland, which may, ultimately, serve to support its mining population.\r\n\r\nIt runs from the northern boundary of Utah to the south line of British\r\nAmerica; Washington Territory and Oregon, lying west. When railroads\r\nshall render it accessible, and open the way for its treasures to a\r\nmarket, it will be filled with an industrious and hardy population who\r\nwill find all the elements of a prosperity as great as any section of\r\nthe Union enjoys. It has three beautiful lakes—the Coeur d’Aline, the\r\nPen d’Oreille, and the Boatman—of some size, and navigable for steamers.\r\nBoisé City is the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTANA TERRITORY\r\n\r\nWas organized May 26th, 1864. It lies among the Rocky Mountains, in\r\npart on the western slope, but extending into the eastern valleys; and\r\ncontains the sources of the streams forming the Missouri river; while\r\nIdaho lies west among the Blue mountains where the tributaries of the\r\nColumbia rise.\r\n\r\nMontana abounds in mines of gold and silver; and these are said to be\r\nmuch richer than those of California. The average yield of ores in\r\nthe latter State is $20 per ton, but the average in Montana is stated\r\nto be four times that amount. Great as is the yield of gold mines here\r\nit is declared that the ease with which silver is separated from its\r\ncombinations in the ore will make that branch of mining more profitable.\r\nCopper also abounds. This territory has several eminent advantages over\r\nother mining districts. It is reached by steamboats on the Missouri\r\nriver, from St. Louis, without transhipment: navigation being free to Ft.\r\nBenton, in the heart of Montana. The river voyage from St. Louis to Ft.\r\nBenton, is made in 28 days.\r\n\r\nThere is a large and constant supply of water, a point of great\r\ndifficulty in most of the other mining regions; and the country\r\neverywhere furnishes easy natural roads, the principal range of the\r\nRocky Mountains not presenting the broken and rugged character of most\r\nother ranges. Associated with this point is the important fact of great\r\nagricultural capability. It is one of the best grazing regions west of\r\nthe Mississippi. Small grain and fruit are grown with the greatest ease,\r\nas also the more important vegetables. There is abundance of timber for\r\nall purposes of home consumption.\r\n\r\nThe area is stated at 153,800 square miles. The population in 1870 was\r\n20,594.\r\n\r\n\r\nALASKA TERRITORY\r\n\r\nWas acquired to the United States by treaty with Russia in the year 1867,\r\nfor $7,200,000. It is a vast region containing 394,000 square miles, with\r\n24,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt was first explored by command of Peter the Great of Russia in 1728. A\r\ngovernment was first established on Kodiak island in 1790. In 1799 the\r\nRussian American fur company was chartered by the Emperor Paul.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion is a tolerably compact body of mainly level\r\ncountry about 600 miles square, and a line of coast runs south for a\r\nlong distance, including many islands. The Aleutian group of islands is\r\nincluded. The principal value of the region to Russia was the fur trade.\r\nThe annual export of these amounted to only a few hundred thousand\r\ndollars. American thrift will probably make much more of it.\r\n\r\nThe country is much warmer than its high latitude would seem to\r\nimply—Sitka in the southern part having about the same mean temperature,\r\nby the thermometer, as Washington! It is, however, extremely damp. In\r\none year there were counted only 66 entire days without rain or snow.\r\nThe coast is broken with mountains. The peninsula of Alaska has some\r\nvery high mountains—Mt. St. Elias and Mt. Fairweather being estimated at\r\n15,000 to 18,000 feet above the sea. The islands of the Aleutian group\r\nare volcanic in origin. There are several rivers, the largest, the Yukon,\r\nor Kwickpak being 2,000 miles long, and navigable for 1,500 miles. There\r\nare vast supplies of timber, much being pine, found nowhere else on\r\nthe Pacific coast. Vegetables, and some grains, may be raised without\r\ndifficulty, and the soil, in parts, is rich. Abundant supplies of coal\r\nare believed to exist. The precious metals and iron, it is thought, are\r\nto be found there, but the country has been very imperfectly explored.\r\n\r\nIn the lively and extensive trade that is likely to grow up with Japan,\r\nChina, and the East Indies, it will no doubt be found of great value, and\r\nits resources contribute to the wealth of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING TERRITORY\r\n\r\nWas organized by act of Congress July 25th, 1868, and is the youngest of\r\nthe territories. Its area is stated at 100,500 square miles, and it had a\r\npopulation, in 1870, of 9,118.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific railroad passes through it, to which its settlement is\r\nprobably mainly due. Montana lies on the north; Dacotah and Nebraska on\r\nthe east; Colorado and Utah on the south, with the northern part of Utah\r\nand Idaho on the west.\r\n\r\nThe main chain of the Rocky Mountains crosses it from northwest to\r\nsoutheast which maintain here the same general characteristic as in\r\nMontana, viz.: that of a rolling upland. Its outlying ranges are\r\nmore broken. Most of the country is good arable, or grazing land,\r\nsufficiently fertile to give excellent returns for labor, though, in\r\nlarge part, requiring irrigation. A few regions are remarkably sterile,\r\nbut they are limited in comparison with the fertile lands.\r\n\r\nGold mining has been successful, to a considerable extent; coal is\r\nextremely abundant and accessible; the supplies for the Pacific railroad\r\nbeing obtained in this territory. Iron has been found in considerable\r\nquantities, together with lead and copper ores. Oil and salt springs\r\npromise to be productive.\r\n\r\nThus without, as yet, developing any eminent specialty, the resources\r\nof this Territory seem to promise all the requisites of prosperity to\r\na large population; while the climate is mild and extremely healthy,\r\nand the great thoroughfare between the east and the west furnishes all\r\nnecessary facilities for transporting its supplies to the best markets.\r\nMore intimate knowledge of its mineral deposits may perhaps give it a\r\nhigher rank as a mining State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nThe first Congress convened under the new Constitution in 1789, held\r\nits session in New York. The seat of government was then removed to\r\nPhiladelphia. There was much dissension as to where it should be\r\npermanently located. The North and the South, were each equally obstinate\r\nin their desire to locate it in their own section, and the quarrel\r\nthreatened a rupture of the confederacy. The great political question of\r\nthe time was the debts of the States contracted in carrying on the War of\r\nIndependence. The South, disliking a strong central-government, opposed\r\ngiving the charge of the finances of the country into its hands; while\r\nthe North, strongly approved the plan of clothing it with authority to\r\nconcentrate the strength of the nation to a reasonable extent, so that it\r\nmight be able to act with vigor, and make the country formidable to its\r\nenemies. The reservation of as much power as possible to the individual\r\nStates was a vital question with the South, since it wished to maintain\r\nSlavery, and it was always foreseen that the north must preponderate,\r\nultimately, in the general government; and the north was unfriendly\r\nto slavery. The Constitution could make its way in the South only by\r\ncompromise as to slavery.\r\n\r\nThe question was a very difficult and delicate one to adjust, but with\r\nmuch tact Jefferson and Hamilton, usually antagonists in politics, united\r\nto urge a compromise; the North conceding the location of the national\r\ncapital, and the South the assumption, by the general government, of the\r\nState debts. This was accomplished in 1790, and Washington selected the\r\nsite on his own Potomac, Virginia and Maryland uniting to give a tract\r\nten miles square, extending to both sides of the river. A new city was\r\nlaid out, and buildings erected which were occupied for the first time\r\nin 1800. This small territory, the government and control of which was\r\nlodged wholly in Congress, was called “Columbia.” This possession of\r\nits own capital was considered important in order to avoid a possible\r\nconflict of Federal and State authority.\r\n\r\nThe capital city was located on the Maryland side, and called Washington.\r\nThe territory on the Virginia side was, in 1846, re-ceded to Virginia. On\r\nFeb. 21st, 1871, the District was made a territory, with a legislature\r\nfor its internal government, and the right to be represented by one\r\nmember in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe population in 1870 was 131,706. Washington is adorned with many\r\nimmense buildings erected for the various departments of the government,\r\nand the capitol itself is one of the largest in the world, and cost\r\n$5,000,000. It is worthy of the great nation represented in its halls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nTHE ANNEXATION POLICY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The original States of the American Union were all on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard. The central States were separated from the fertile valleys and\r\nplains of the Mississippi and its tributaries by mountains, while those\r\nlying at the northern and southern extreme found, in the vast forests\r\nfilled with fierce and hostile savages, a still greater barrier against\r\nsettlement westward. The “Old Thirteen” found their hands and thoughts\r\nsufficiently occupied with the establishment of their liberties, and the\r\nultimate western boundaries of the country were left to be settled in\r\nfuture years. Fortunately for us England was too much occupied with the\r\nimmense debt the useless American war had cost her to make difficulties\r\nover the cession of the western regions to us; and, at the peace, we\r\nwere in possession of the whole region from the Atlantic ocean to\r\nthe Mississippi river. That was enough and more for the present; but\r\nthe people were enterprising. We offered a home, freedom, and great\r\nopportunities to the oppressed and poor of other lands, and that region\r\nwas soon sufficiently peopled to show what other regions were required to\r\nsecure the prosperity of all.\r\n\r\n2. It soon became clear that the development of the Western States east\r\nof the Mississippi required the possession of the lower part of the river\r\nand the territory on its western bank. Circumstances were favorable to\r\nits acquisition, and Louisiana, extending from the mouth of the river\r\nfar up toward its head waters, including several hundred thousand square\r\nmiles of as valuable land as was to be found on the continent, was\r\npurchased. It entered into the vindictive policy of Napoleon Bonaparte\r\nto injure England by strengthening America, and it was obtained for\r\nthe comparatively insignificant sum of fifteen million dollars. This\r\nannexation was altogether essential to the security and development of\r\nthe larger part of the original territory.\r\n\r\n3. Florida was discovered and settled by the Spaniards, who claimed\r\nthe coast along the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi river. Though it\r\nwas not commercially or agriculturally important to us, it became in\r\nthe hands of a power not very friendly, the support and refuge of the\r\nbarbarous and resolutely hostile Indians of our southern border. It was\r\nnecessary to nearly exterminate them to obtain peace, but no absolute\r\nsecurity could be assured while the Spanish territory protected them in\r\ntheir retreat before our armies. Peace, security against the Indians,\r\nand freedom from the intermeddling of a European Power required the\r\nacquisition of that peninsula and the Gulf Coast. After twenty years of\r\noccasional negotiation it was purchased for five millions of dollars.\r\nThis was the most convenient way, also, of settling an account for\r\nspoliations on our commerce which we held against Spain, and the only\r\nmeans she then possessed of making payment. Thus another annexation was\r\nmade under the pressure of circumstances.\r\n\r\n4. By this time a sufficient degree of expansion and strength had\r\nbeen acquired by the New Nation to inspire in it great confidence in\r\nitself and grand views of its future, and the “Monroe Doctrine,” that\r\nthe United States would refrain from all meddling with the politics of\r\nEurope, but would resolutely oppose the meddling of any European power\r\nwith the politics of this continent, was adopted. This doctrine did not\r\npropose any interference with other governments already established\r\nhere, but America was to be left to its present possessors, and European\r\nambition was to look elsewhere for kingdoms to conquer or found. A\r\ntacit protectorate over all America was assumed, in order to prevent\r\nthe entrance of any other element that might build up a system hostile\r\nto our interests and progress. It was a legitimate conclusion from the\r\nprinciples and necessities that had led to the inauguration of the\r\nannexation policy. The nation claimed that it had a right to keep the\r\nground clear from obstacles to its natural development. It was a system\r\nof growth and protection involving no ideas of conquest by force, and no\r\nmenace to governments already established.\r\n\r\n5. The third addition to our territorial area took place under\r\ncircumstances which all true Americans will ever regret. If stated by\r\nour enemies it would be said that, after encouraging the settlement\r\nof the territory of a neighbor by our own citizens, and giving them\r\ncovert support in withdrawing that territory from its proper owners, we\r\ntook possession of it, and when they naturally undertook to protect, or\r\nrecover it, we made a war of invasion on them, employed our superior\r\nskill and vigor to disarm their State, and took as much more of their\r\nterritory as suited our purposes; in short, that we picked a quarrel, and\r\nbeing the strongest bound and robbed them.\r\n\r\n6. It cannot be agreeable to lovers of justice and defenders of equal\r\nrights, that there should be so much of truth in this statement as to\r\nrender it impossible to clearly and distinctly prove the contrary. There\r\nwas, however, an element of the necessary and unavoidable, even in\r\nthis, that was more in harmony with the previous system of acquisition\r\nthan appeared on the surface. Texas presented, perhaps, the finest\r\nclimate and the greatest facilities for money-making on the continent.\r\nThe Mexicans inherited the religion and hatred of protestants with the\r\nhaughty, repelling spirit of the Spaniards, and wished to preserve the\r\nold Spanish policy of separating themselves from us by a broad barrier\r\nof desert and wilderness. They did not wish to settle Texas themselves,\r\nnor feel willing that any one else should. It is inevitable that\r\nenterprise and strength, impelled by self-interest, will disregard such\r\nwishes. Americans are neither perfect nor magnanimous enough to stand\r\non ceremony when their interests are concerned. The best that can be\r\nsaid of them is that they are more moderate and self-contained than any\r\nother people. The necessities of the institution of slavery required\r\nmore territory to balance the rapid increase of free States, and this\r\nprecipitated the movement that was inevitable sooner or later from other\r\ncauses. Indeed the first patent of territory obtained in Texas, from the\r\nMexican government, was by a native of Connecticut. The rapid growth\r\nof commerce in the Pacific ocean, the agreeable climate and fertile\r\nsoil of California, and the unsettled, wilderness state of that region,\r\ncaused the commercial nations of Europe to look at it with longing eyes.\r\nThe Monroe doctrine was in danger of being violated. England had fully\r\nprepared to plant a colony there when it was taken possession of by the\r\nAmerican forces.\r\n\r\n7. Thus the enterprise and energy of the nation, which had still\r\nfurther developed its instinct, or anticipations and plans, of future\r\ngreatness, required to use the vast resources of the Gulf region, and to\r\nextend settlements to the Pacific Slope in order to develop the mineral\r\nresources of that region and prepare to build up its commerce with\r\nEastern Asia. The northern parts of Mexico were useless to her, since she\r\nhad neither population to occupy them, nor strength to subdue the Indians\r\nwho roamed over them in scattered bands. There is a justice and propriety\r\nwhich has the force of Natural Law in allowing the active and vigorous\r\nto take possession of the natural resources that others can not or will\r\nnot develop. The earth was made for mankind as a whole, and what cannot\r\nbenefit one race, another, that is able to employ it for its own and the\r\ngeneral good, has some show of right in entering upon. That, at least,\r\nmust be the justification of our ancestors in intruding themselves upon\r\nthe lands and hunting grounds of the aboriginal inhabitants of America,\r\nand our only excuse for making war with the Indians, forcing them to part\r\nwith their lands, confining them to reservations, and denying to King\r\nPhilip, Powhattan, and Tecumseh the admiration and esteem we give to the\r\npatriotic defenders of our native land and natural rights.\r\n\r\n8. It is to be regretted that the vast and valuable territory acquired\r\nfrom Mexico should be the spoil of conquest rather than the fruit\r\nof peaceful negotiation; but the eagerness of the speculator, the\r\nunreasonable pride and selfishness of the Mexican, and the peculiar\r\nrequirements of our internal conflict over slavery put to silence, for a\r\ntime, the voice of moderation and equity, and we annexed near 1,000,000\r\nsquare miles of territory by force. The payment of $18,500,000, when we\r\nmight have taken it without, was an indication that our ordinary sense of\r\njustice was not altogether quenched.\r\n\r\n9. We may reasonably consider that this was exceptional, and that the\r\nconfusion of judgment and the disorder consequent on the life and death\r\nstruggle of the institution of slavery, which were in a few years\r\nto produce the most terrible civil war known to history, led us into\r\nthe comparatively moderate aggression and violence that marked this\r\nannexation to our territorial area. Our traditional policy is to acquire\r\npeaceably, and with a satisfactory remuneration, such territory as the\r\nnational progress and development demand. It is contrary to the spirit of\r\nour institutions to oblige the majority of the inhabitants of any region\r\nnot within our boundaries to form a part of the Republic.\r\n\r\n10. Two annexations have been made since the Mexican war. Arizona was\r\nobtained by treaty and purchase from Mexico, in 1854, and Alaska by\r\ntreaty and purchase from Russia, in 1867. The first is valuable for its\r\nmineral treasures. It was useless to Mexico, though we gave $10,000,000\r\nfor it. It will ultimately be worth to us hundreds of millions, and its\r\nruins of an ancient people will be replaced by a thriving population of\r\nintelligent freemen. Alaska is specially valuable in relation to our\r\nfuture commerce with Asia, and for its fisheries and fur trade. Its\r\ninternal resources are, as yet, scarcely known.\r\n\r\n11. The superior stability of American institutions and the love of\r\nlaw and order of the American people may make annexation desirable and\r\nprofitable to the more volatile and unsteady Southern States of America,\r\nbut it is probable that no labored efforts to induce annexation will be\r\ntolerated by the mass of the people. We may fairly judge that we have\r\nreached our natural boundaries; that the advancement of neighboring\r\ngovernments in order and intelligence will suffice to give protection\r\nto the comparatively small numbers who may find a better field for\r\ntheir energies without than within the Union; and that if any future\r\nannexations are made it will be by the purchase of uninhabited regions\r\nthat may be more valuable to us than to their owners; or that, if any\r\ninhabited regions are incorporated into the Union, it will be at the\r\ninstance and desire of its own inhabitants rather than of our people.\r\nWe are the special champions of popular and all other rights, and shall\r\nnever be likely to forget ourselves again so far as to repeat the Mexican\r\nwar, however pressing our desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nCENSUS STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation of the United States and Territories from 1790 to 1870.\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note: Some of the figures in this table are unreadable and\r\nare represented by X.

The\r\nState of Georgia has the largest colored population; Virginia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina and Louisiana follow next in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the last census (1870), the seven leading States rank,\r\naccording to population, as follows: (1) New York; (2) Pennsylvania; (3)\r\nOhio; (4) Illinois; (5) Missouri; (6) Indiana; (7) Massachusetts. Thus\r\n_four_ out of the seven most populous States are “new States;” that is,\r\nthey were not included in the original “thirteen.” In 1789, the four\r\nStates at the head of the list were: (1) Virginia; (2) Pennsylvania; (3)\r\nNorth Carolina; (4) Massachusetts. At present, Virginia (if the State had\r\nnot been divided) would have ranked in the seventh place, or next _after_\r\nIndiana. In absolute increase of inhabitants, Pennsylvania heads the\r\nlist of the old States in the last decade: and the total population of\r\nsaid State is about equal to that of the thirteen States of Connecticut,\r\nArkansas, West Virginia, Minnesota, Kansas, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode\r\nIsland, Florida, Delaware, Nebraska, Oregon and Nevada. The aggregate\r\npopulation of the six New England States of Massachusetts, Maine,\r\nConnecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island falls considerably\r\nshort of that of Pennsylvania. The States west of the Mississippi,\r\nincluding the Pacific States, have about _one-sixth_ of the whole\r\npopulation of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of increase in population from 1790 to 1800 was 35.02 per\r\ncent.; from 1800 to 1810, 36.45 per cent.; from 1810 to 1820, 33.13 per\r\ncent.; from 1820 to 1830, 33.49 per cent.; from 1830 to 1840, 32.67 per\r\ncent.; from 1840 to 1850, 38.57 per cent.; from 1850 to 1860, 37.75 per\r\ncent.; from 1860 to 1870, 22.34 per cent. Supposing the increase during\r\nthis decade (since 1870) to be 30 per cent. there would be in 1875 nearly\r\n45,000,000 inhabitants. We have reason to suppose it to be at least 35\r\nper cent. This, in 1880, would give 52,437,192.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD.\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. All government is professedly for the good of the people; but in\r\npoint of fact, nearly every government that has ever been instituted has\r\nbeen in the interest of an individual, a family, or a class. American\r\nstatesmen, in forming our government, admitted the superior rights of no\r\nman or class of men. It was carefully organized to exclude all claims\r\nor pretenses of that kind, with a single exception, at first, which\r\nafterward disappeared in the tempest of a civil war. The executive, the\r\nvarious members of the government, and the law makers depend on the\r\npeople for their elevation. At first they possessed only the dignity,\r\nprivileges, and rights of the people at large, and, their term of office\r\nexpired, they return to the same level, honored, indeed, if they have\r\nbeen faithful servants; if not, carrying to their dishonored graves the\r\nreproaches and contempt of their fellow-citizens, but retaining, in\r\nneither case, a vestige of the power and exaltation over others that\r\nclothed them when in office, the contrary of which so often makes an\r\nunworthy man respectable in a different form of government.\r\n\r\n2. That the masses of the people would be able to exercise a true\r\nsovereignty without abusing it was always doubted until the trial was\r\nmade in this country. A very respectable class of statesmen in the early\r\ndays of the Republic, sympathized in this doubt, and it even crept\r\ninto the Constitution in the form of electors who were to choose the\r\nPresident; intimating a distrust of the wisdom and sound discretion of\r\nthe voters in the choice of the Chief Magistrate. The liberty allowed to\r\nthe Legislatures of the States to determine the manner in which electors\r\nshould be chosen, while it recognized State authority on one side, on the\r\nother implied a hesitation to trust so important a matter directly to the\r\npeople; and for a long time they were only indirectly consulted as to the\r\nchoice of a President.\r\n\r\n3. It was not, however, caused by a desire to keep power from them,\r\nbut rather to avoid the unhappy effect of popular heat and rashness,\r\nso often observed in popular governments before attempted. This\r\ndistrustful party first took control of the government, retained it\r\nduring three presidential terms, and for many years afterwards formed an\r\ninfluential minority whose criticisms were of importance in establishing\r\na traditional policy for the government. This party—the Federalists,\r\nheaded by Washington and Hamilton—sought to found a strong and stable\r\ngovernment that should be able to fully protect the country from foreign\r\ninterference and domestic discord. Their control over the administration\r\nwas somewhat abruptly closed by acts considered arbitrary, interfering\r\nwith full freedom of speech and of the press—the “Sedition Laws” as they\r\nwere called. Jefferson and the Republican party demanded the largest\r\npopular freedom, and had the conduct of the government for twenty-four\r\nyears, impressing on its habits and policy the respect for the opinions\r\nof the people at large that has ever since characterized it. The people\r\ngradually gained control of presidential elections and practically set\r\nthe electors aside, making and enforcing their own choice in general\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n4. The exercise of popular sovereignty has gradually been enlarged, no\r\nqualification but that of age and nativity being now generally required,\r\nand the government may fairly be considered to represent the views of\r\na majority of the people, and not only of the native, but also of the\r\nforeign born; since the great mass of the latter are, by naturalization,\r\nabsorbed into the mass of citizens. They come to make a permanent home\r\nwith us, from a preference, as it is fair to assume, for republican\r\ninstitutions; and it is considered right that they should have a voice in\r\nthe conduct of them. Nor have the American people seen cause to regret\r\ntheir liberality in this respect. Citizens of foreign birth have usually\r\nproved as thoughtful and wise as the rest of the population, and as\r\nworthy of citizenship. They bring to us wealth in their labor if not in\r\ntheir purses, and soon become thoroughly American in their habits and\r\nsympathies. The government and the people cordially welcome them, and\r\nfind themselves the stronger and richer by so doing.\r\n\r\n5. It must not be forgotten that the strongest fears of popular\r\ninfluence on the government, the stability of our institutions, and the\r\nmaintenance of the good order necessary to the security of property\r\nand the general prosperity, were entertained at the first; that the\r\nprophecies of the foreseers of evil have been almost uniformly false\r\nduring its whole course; and that the relation between the people and the\r\ngeneral government has constantly grown closer, to the great advantage\r\nof both. The first war into which the country was plunged after the\r\nRevolution—that of 1812—was comparatively a failure, in its earlier part,\r\nfor want of this mutual confidence. Later the people and the government\r\nhave been more closely allied, and the government has been strong while\r\nthe people have seen their cherished ends gained.\r\n\r\nThere has been continual advance in liberality of administration, in\r\nefficiency of organization, and in the completeness of social order. We\r\nhave no reason to suppose that a tendency, continued through a hundred\r\nyears and favored by so many circumstances that are common to all nations\r\nin our generation to a degree never before known, will be changed. Rather\r\nwe may confidently expect that with increased intelligence, experience,\r\nand prosperity that tendency will be strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE AND CITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The right pertaining to citizenship, to vote for such officers as are\r\nelected by the people, is called suffrage. When that right is acquired\r\nwith respect to one class of officers it always extends to the whole,\r\nfrom petty town or city officials, to high officers of the State and\r\nUnited States government—all, in short, who obtain office directly from\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n2. The Constitution defines who shall be regarded as citizens of the\r\nUnited States, and all such are declared by it to be also citizens of\r\nthe State in which they reside. It declares “all persons, born, or\r\nnaturalized in the United States, and subject to its jurisdiction” to be\r\ncitizens. Indian tribes are mostly regarded as foreign nations, and have\r\nsuch rights as treaties give them, but are not taxed and do not vote;\r\ntherefore they are not regarded as citizens.\r\n\r\n3. Yet suffrage does not belong to _all_ citizens. The special regulation\r\nof the voting prerogative was not assumed by the Constitution, nor\r\ndelegated to Congress, and it is generally conceded that it belongs to\r\nthe State governments. The regulations in the States are not uniform,\r\nbut in no State do women or minors vote. This cuts off a large part of\r\nthe citizens, nearly three-fourths belonging to these classes. Minors\r\nare supposed, however, to be represented, as to their interests, by\r\ntheir guardians, and females by husbands or brothers. Some of the States\r\nmake minor restrictions as to length of residence in the State, and\r\nrequire a certain amount of property to constitute a voter, and in some\r\nnaturalization is not required—so that the range of the right of suffrage\r\nvaries within small limits, in different States. Whatever rule is adopted\r\nby the States has been accepted as the basis of suffrage for that State\r\nby the general government, when members of Congress and President and\r\nVice-President are voted for.\r\n\r\n4. It seems to be a loose point in the regulations, otherwise so\r\nadmirable, since it may work a considerable inequality under given\r\ncircumstances; and, in some cases, might change the policy of the\r\ngovernment. It is a question worthy of consideration whether there\r\nshould not be an amendment to the Constitution establishing uniformity\r\nof suffrage in all the States. This point has caused much discussion\r\nin the State governments and various changes have been, from time to\r\ntime, made in many of them. These have been, usually, in the direction\r\nof liberality—tending to enlarge the scope of suffrage. The property\r\nqualification, quite common in earlier times, is now rare. The fifteenth\r\namendment, recently adopted, has largely increased the number of voters.\r\n\r\n5. The experience of the Republic, thus far, has been in favor of the\r\ndoctrine that it is safe to trust the people with their own interests,\r\nand that the responsibilities of self-government, when they are laid\r\non them under the favorable circumstances that exist among us, tend to\r\nimprovement instead of disorganization. Whether this will always be the\r\ncase it may not be safe to assume, and a prudent regard to possibilities\r\nshould not be neglected; but we should not forget that those who founded\r\nAmerican liberty ran great risks of anarchy in the eyes of their\r\ncontemporaries. We ought to be able safely to continue a policy of\r\nsuffrage which they introduced with results so fortunate.\r\n\r\n6. Education needs to be encouraged, and this has always received much\r\nattention. It is probable that but for the very liberal provision made in\r\nthis respect, the fate of our government would have been very different.\r\nMany foreigners who had no early education, have been naturalized, and\r\nthe colored people born in the country have been made citizens. If the\r\nremainder of the people had not been intelligent, it would no doubt have\r\nbeen extremely dangerous. It has led to some serious local interruptions\r\nof order and prosperity, but they have been, so far, temporary; and the\r\ngeneral effect has been to awaken ambition for education; the children of\r\nnew-made citizens have enjoyed the same facilities as others to acquire\r\nintelligence necessary to a citizen; and the right of suffrage, when\r\nextended to the ignorant and degraded has seemed to produce the general\r\neffect of destroying a dangerous class by raising them gradually to\r\nintelligence and self-respect and respect for the laws, by making them\r\nthe political equals of those who are socially and intellectually far\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\n7. As we grow in numbers all influences like this take a wider range,\r\nand acquire more power, and sometimes produce different results, when\r\nthey become extensive, from what was the case when more limited, from\r\nthe difference of influence in modifying causes; and there has always\r\nbeen fear of trouble from the extension of suffrage to too many ignorant\r\npersons. It is well to be cautious; but we ought to venture as far as\r\npossible for the sake of improving and elevating all classes of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n8. It is also a question worthy of attention if women who own property\r\nthat is taxed ought not to possess the right of suffrage. The war that\r\nmade us a Nation was begun because we refused to be taxed unless we\r\ncould be represented, and have a vote in the body laying the taxes. The\r\nprinciple appears to be precisely the same; and what we fought for then\r\nshould not be denied now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOUR CITIZENS OF FOREIGN BIRTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever fault we may sometimes find with the conduct of our government;\r\nhowever much self-seeking to the neglect of the public good there may be\r\namong officials; however many weaknesses, errors, and violations of law\r\nmay call for our severest reprobation, and, in moments of depression,\r\nlead us to look gloomily and doubtfully toward the future; yet it is not\r\nto be denied that the Home of real Freedom is with us. Mismanagement is\r\nbut temporary, or limited, and easily admits of remedy, with time and\r\ncare; our advantages are permanent and extensive. In eighty years the\r\npopulation has become nearly twelve times as numerous as at the beginning\r\nof that period, and this rapid growth in numbers has been made up largely\r\nfrom the disposition of foreigners to make a permanent home among us.\r\nThose who are oppressed, who suffer restraint in their interests or\r\nbelief, or wish for a wider career for themselves or their families—who\r\nwant a free field for business enterprise, for mental and moral\r\ndevelopment, or full play for their abilities to influence their fellow\r\nmen, come to us. Here they find fair opportunity for what may be lacking\r\nelsewhere. They come here by millions; the poor, by industry, become\r\nrich; the oppressed leave persecutions and galling burdens behind them;\r\nand genius finds full play for its aspirations in whatever direction its\r\nenergies may be turned.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the last Census there were 5,566,546 persons in the Union,\r\nand forming part of our population, of foreign birth. A large part of\r\nthese have become citizens by Naturalization. The remainder, or their\r\ndescendants, if they remain here, will become citizens by that process,\r\nor by lapse of time.\r\n\r\nAfter they have become familiar with our institution, ideas, and habits,\r\nthey are incorporated with the body of our citizens and are a part of the\r\nNation. The naturalized citizen may become, in time, a State officer,\r\nor member of Congress, if he can make himself acceptable to his fellow\r\ncitizens; or he may possibly live to see his son President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nCongress alone has power, under the Constitution, to enact naturalization\r\nlaws. Suffrage, or the right of voting, is left to the regulation of the\r\nStates, within certain limits; but every citizen, made such by law of the\r\nGeneral Government, is also a citizen of the State in which he resides,\r\nand will acquire, within such times as State regulations shall determine,\r\nthe right to vote.\r\n\r\nState laws regarding suffrage vary. Some States even admit aliens who are\r\nnot citizens of the United States to the right of suffrage and to other\r\nprivileges; and most require any citizen to reside a prescribed length of\r\ntime in the State before he can vote. A uniform regulation in all the\r\nStates would be desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BECOME A CITIZEN.\r\n\r\nAny alien, having arrived in the United States after the age of eighteen\r\nyears, may be admitted to the rights of citizenship, after a declaration,\r\nupon his part, or oath or affirmation, before the Supreme, Superior,\r\nDistrict, or Circuit Court of, or any court of record having common\r\nlaw jurisdiction in, any of the United States, or of the territories\r\nthereto belonging, or before a Circuit or District Court of the United\r\nStates, or the Clerk or Prothonotary of any of the aforesaid courts,\r\ntwo years at least before his admission, that it is his _bona fide_\r\nintention to become a citizen of the United States, and to renounce\r\nforever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate,\r\nState or sovereignty whatever, and particularly by name, the prince,\r\npotentate, State, or sovereignty, whereof such alien may at any time\r\nhave been a citizen or subject; if such alien has borne any hereditary\r\ntitle, or been of any of the orders of nobility in the kingdom or State\r\nfrom which he came, he must, moreover, expressly renounce his title or\r\norder of nobility, in the court in which his application is made, which\r\nrenunciation is to be recorded in such county; and the court admitting\r\nsuch alien must also be satisfied that he has continuously resided in\r\nthe United States for five years, at least, immediately preceding his\r\nnaturalization, and also within the State or Territory wherein such court\r\nis at the time held, at least one year immediately previous to such\r\nnaturalization; and that during such five years he has been of good moral\r\ncharacter, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same;\r\nthe oath of at least two citizens of the United States is requisite to\r\nprove the fact of such residence; and, at the time of his application\r\nto be admitted to citizenship, he must make, upon oath or affirmation,\r\nthe same declaration of renunciation and abjuration of allegiance to\r\nany foreign power, and also make oath or affirmation to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States; all of which proceedings are to be\r\nrecorded by the Clerk or Prothonotary of the proper court.\r\n\r\nIf any alien, having legally filed his declaration of intention to become\r\na citizen and taken the necessary oath or affirmation, die before he is\r\nactually naturalized, his widow and children are entitled to all the\r\nrights and privileges of citizens, upon taking the required oaths or\r\naffirmations.\r\n\r\nAny alien arriving in the United States under the age of eighteen years,\r\nand continuously residing therein until the time of his application for\r\ncitizenship, may, after reaching the age of twenty-one years, and having\r\nbeen a resident within the United States for five years, including the\r\nthree years of his minority, be admitted a citizen, without making the\r\nformal declaration of intention required in other cases; but at the time\r\nof his admission he must make such declaration, and further satisfy the\r\ncourt, upon oath or affirmation, that, for the three years immediately\r\npreceding, it had been his _bona fide_ intention to become such citizen,\r\nand in all other respects must comply with the naturalization laws of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nSevere penalties for counterfeiting any evidence of citizenship, or\r\ndisposing of a certificate of naturalization to any person other than the\r\none for whom it was issued, are imposed by act of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A pure democracy is a government in which all the people who have the\r\nproper qualifications for voting personally take part—or have the right\r\nto do so—in the discussion of public measures, and enactment of the\r\nlaws. This is not practicable unless the State consist of a small number\r\nof persons; and a representative democracy is substituted, in which\r\nthe masses of the people exercise the voting and ruling prerogative\r\nby appointing a small number of substitutes to act in their place and\r\nrepresent them. This appointment of representatives is for the most part\r\nthe only direct way in which the people of this country are able to take\r\npart in the government. Though the theory is that the people alone are\r\nsovereign, this is the only way in which sovereignty can exert itself.\r\nEven if present in a legislative assembly, they cannot discuss or vote\r\nunless they are Representatives, duly elected.\r\n\r\n2. Elections, then, are of the highest importance. If a citizen would\r\nexert his sovereign authority, as one of the depositaries of power, he\r\nmust take part in them. Representatives elected to make laws are expected\r\nto express the will of the majority of the people whom they represent.\r\nThey are pledged, expressly or tacitly, to do so. If they disobey the\r\nwill of their constituents, there is no immediate redress. They can be\r\ndisplaced only at the close of the term for which they were elected.\r\nThere is some inconvenience and danger attending this method; though\r\nthe fear of the displeasure of their constituents is usually sufficient\r\nto secure faithfulness. Where the people are numerous, (there are now\r\nmore than 135,000 persons to each representative,) it becomes a matter\r\nof much interest to know what is their will. It is ascertained by the\r\nelections. The people vote for a candidate, or nominee, known to hold\r\ncertain political principles. As men do not often see or think alike\r\nthere is generally more than one principle, or system of views, regarding\r\npublic measures, involved in every election, and therefore more than one\r\ncandidate. The result of the vote shows the will of the majority. The\r\nsame question generally occupies the attention of the whole country, and\r\nthe elections to Congress determine the policy of the government, so far\r\nas legislation is concerned.\r\n\r\n3. The same remarks apply to the election of the President and the\r\nmembers of the State governments. The choice of men for the State\r\nlegislatures determines the policy and political principles of the\r\nState government, and as the majority in State legislatures appoint the\r\nSenators, the character of Congress and its measures are influenced\r\nby State elections. The choice of the President is not, in theory,\r\nmade directly, since Electors are chosen, who afterwards vote for the\r\nPresident; but it is understood that they will vote for a certain man;\r\nand it has been so invariably their custom to do so, that the result\r\nis considered as settled by the direct vote of the people. Should the\r\nElectors do otherwise the people would be very much surprised and\r\ndispleased, and those Electors would have little prospect of appointment\r\nto office again. Very few men in office are willing to seriously offend\r\ntheir constituents, so that practically, the people vote directly for the\r\nPresident and Vice-President they prefer.\r\n\r\n4. Of all our elections none is considered of so much importance as the\r\nPresidential. These come every four years, because the Constitution\r\nprovides that the term for which a President is chosen, shall be four\r\nyears. Our elections, both for the general and State governments, are by\r\nballot, instead of _viva voce_, (the living voice,) as in some countries.\r\n\r\nThe ballot is a small piece of paper, with the name of the candidate or\r\ncandidates printed or written upon it, and then folded in such a manner\r\nas to hide them, so that no one but the voter can tell what names are on\r\nhis ballot. A vote by _viva voce_, is when the voter, in the presence of\r\nthe inspectors of the election, audibly and clearly calls out the name of\r\nthe candidate for whom he votes, and thus proclaims in the hearing of all\r\npresent how he votes. But the ballot enables the voter to vote secretly\r\nif he chooses to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nRATIO OF REPRESENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The ratio of representation simply means the ratio between the\r\nwhole population of the United States, and the whole number of their\r\nRepresentatives in Congress; and this of course includes the ratio\r\nbetween the people of any individual State, and the Representatives it\r\nis entitled to; both being estimated upon the same basis, and determined\r\nby the same rule.\r\n\r\n2. The distinctive characteristic of our government is, that it is a\r\n_popular_ government. Its power is vested in the people. They elect\r\ntheir rulers, who are the servants of the people, and these rulers are\r\nexpected to carry out the people’s wishes. Upon such a system, it is a\r\nmatter of the first importance, to distribute this power equally among\r\nall the people, and after having fixed upon the ratio between the whole\r\npopulation and the whole number of Representatives; or, in other words,\r\nafter having determined how many members shall compose the lower House\r\nof Congress, the next step is to apportion these members among all the\r\nStates in the ratio of their population. If one State has twice the\r\nnumber of inhabitants that another has, it will be entitled to twice\r\nthe number of Representatives in Congress. If one has ten times the\r\ninhabitants that another has, it will be entitled to ten times the number\r\nof Representatives, and so on; with this one exception, which is, that\r\nby a provision in the Constitution, every State, without regard to its\r\npopulation, is entitled to one Representative in the lower House.\r\n\r\n3. The adjustment of this matter is all provided for in the Constitution,\r\nthat is, in its general features; but it devolves upon Congress in every\r\ntenth year to re-adjust and re-apportion the Representatives among the\r\nseveral States, according to the population of each State as shown by the\r\nlast census, which is taken every tenth year; and when the apportionment\r\nis once made, it remains the same for the next ten years, when the census\r\nis taken again, and a new apportionment is made.\r\n\r\n4. Up to the present time (1874,) this has been done nine times. It was\r\ndone the first time by the convention which formed the Constitution. That\r\napportionment is found in the Constitution, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n  To New Hampshire,      3\r\n     Massachusetts,      8\r\n     Pennsylvania,       8\r\n     Delaware,           1\r\n     Rhode Island,       1\r\n     Connecticut,        5\r\n     New York,           6\r\n     New Jersey,         4\r\n     Maryland,           6\r\n     Virginia,          10\r\n     North Carolina,     5\r\n     South Carolina,     5\r\n     Georgia,            3\r\n\r\nBy this it will be seen that the first Congress consisted of but 65\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution also provided that Representatives should not exceed\r\none to every 30,000 people. The next year after the government went\r\ninto operation, (1790,) the first census was taken, and as soon as the\r\nresult was known, a new apportionment was made. This was done in 1792,\r\nand was made upon the ratio of one Representative to every 33,000 of\r\nrepresentative[4] population.\r\n\r\n    [4] The Representative population includes all free persons,\r\n    white or black; to which (according to the provisions of the\r\n    Constitution), three-fifths of all the slaves were to be added.\r\n    But this proviso, now that slavery is abolished, has become a\r\n    nullity.\r\n\r\n5. In 1800, the second census was taken; and when Congress made the\r\napportionment, which was done in 1803, it did not change the ratio, but\r\nleft it at one Representative to every 33,000 of the representative\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, the third census was taken, and in 1811 the ratio was fixed at\r\none Representative for every 35,000 of the population.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, the fourth census was taken, and in 1822 Congress fixed the\r\nratio at one Representative for every 47,000 of the population.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, the fifth census was taken, and in 1832 the ratio was fixed at\r\none Representative to every 47,000 of the population.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, the sixth census was taken, and in 1842 Congress again declared\r\nthat the ratio should be one Representative to every 70,000 of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n6. In 1850, the seventh census was taken, and in conformity with the law\r\npassed this year, the number of members was for the first time limited;\r\nthe limit being 233; and the Secretary of the Interior was ordered to\r\ntake the census returns, and divide the whole representative population\r\nby the number 233, and to make the quotient the ratio between the\r\nRepresentatives and the people.\r\n\r\n7. We have never seen the result of the Secretary’s estimate, but, taking\r\nthe population of 1850 and dividing it by 233, would produce a quotient\r\nof nearly 94,000; and this we take as the ratio, after the time when\r\nit was done, 1852; that is, one Representative to every 94,000 of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n8. The eighth census was taken in 1860, and on it an apportionment\r\nwas based, which allowed one Representative for every 127,000 of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Congress adopted the principle of permanently fixing the\r\nnumber of members of Congress, to save the trouble of doing it as\r\nheretofore, every ten years. An act was passed limiting it to 233;\r\nbut notwithstanding this limitation, it was provided that if any new\r\nState came in, it should have its member, which would add to the\r\nnumber. But this increase was to continue no longer than until the next\r\napportionment, when the number was to fall back again to the old figure.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the law was modified to make the whole number of members\r\nconsist of 241 after the 3d of March, 1863. In 1870 the ninth census\r\nwas taken, and in 1872 Congress decided that after March 3d, 1873, the\r\nRepresentatives should comprise 292 members, being one Representative for\r\nevery 135,239 of the population and apportioned them among the several\r\nStates as follows:\r\n\r\n  Alabama,             8\r\n  Arkansas,            4\r\n  California,          4\r\n  Connecticut,         4\r\n  Delaware,            1\r\n  Florida,             2\r\n  Georgia,             9\r\n  Mississippi,         6\r\n  Missouri,           13\r\n  Nebraska,            1\r\n  Nevada,              1\r\n  New Hampshire,       3\r\n  New Jersey,          7\r\n  New York,           33\r\n  North Carolina,      8\r\n  Ohio,               20\r\n  Illinois,           19\r\n  Indiana,            13\r\n  Iowa,                9\r\n  Kansas,              3\r\n  Kentucky,           10\r\n  Louisiana,           6\r\n  Maine,               5\r\n  Maryland,            6\r\n  Massachusetts,      11\r\n  Michigan,            9\r\n  Minnesota,           3\r\n  Oregon,              1\r\n  Pennsylvania,       27\r\n  Rhode Island,        2\r\n  South Carolina,      5\r\n  Tennessee,          10\r\n  Texas,               6\r\n  Vermont,             3\r\n  Virginia,            9\r\n  West Virginia,       3\r\n  Wisconsin,           8\r\n\r\n9. But it must be borne in mind that Congress has the power to alter all\r\nthis, and to enact that Congress shall consist of any other number of\r\nmembers, although it is not probable that this will be done soon.\r\n\r\n10. The foregoing statements will show the general plan upon which the\r\nHouse of Representatives is constituted, and how the several States\r\nare constantly changing the number of their Representatives, and their\r\nrelative power and influence in Congress. This can be readily understood\r\nby remembering the fact that new States come into the Union every few\r\nyears, and that the population increases much more rapidly in the Western\r\nStates than in the Eastern, and that, consequently, the West is rapidly\r\ngaining power in Congress, while the Atlantic States are losing it.\r\n\r\n11. In the apportionment no regard is had to the Territories or to their\r\npopulation. In this adjustment, the States and their population only are\r\nregarded, and the number of members is all given to the States. Every\r\nRepresentative from a Territory is an addition to that number, but it\r\nmust be remembered that a Territorial member has no right to vote on any\r\nquestion, but has only the right to debate; and for this reason he is\r\nnot, in the fullest sense, a member, and is not counted in adjusting the\r\nnumber of which the House is made to consist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOATHS AND BONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. An oath is an appeal to God, by him who makes it, that what he has\r\nsaid, or what he shall say, is the truth. It is the most solemn form\r\nunder which one can assert or pronounce anything. To utter a falsehood\r\nwhile under oath is perjury, a crime of the darkest hue. One which\r\nGod has declared he will punish, and one which is made infamous, and\r\npunishable by fine and imprisonment by the laws of the land.\r\n\r\n2. The Constitution (Art. 6, Sec. 3) requires that Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, and members of the several State Legislatures, and all\r\nexecutive and judicial officers, both of the United States, and of the\r\nseveral States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support the\r\nConstitution. Then in the second article, section eight, the form of the\r\noath required of the President before he enters upon his duties, is given\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the\r\noffice of President of the United States, and will to the best of my\r\nability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.”\r\n\r\n3. This is all the Constitution says about oaths; but it is enough to\r\nshow that no man (unless he commit perjury,) can accept office, either\r\nunder the United States or any State government, unless he in good faith\r\nwill support the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut in the laws enacted by Congress, we find that not only official oaths\r\nare required; but in a great variety of other cases, men who transact\r\nbusiness with the government are required to verify their accounts and\r\nstatements with an oath. This is particularly the case with those who\r\ndo business with the custom house; such as merchants, shipowners, and\r\nmasters of vessels. Many oaths must be put in the form of affidavits;\r\nthat is, the oath must be written and signed by the deponent, that the\r\nstatements made may be preserved.\r\n\r\n4. The form of official oaths varies according to the nature of the\r\nduties to be performed by the deponent. The oath must be taken before the\r\nofficer enters upon his duties. Should he neglect or refuse to do this,\r\nhis acts will be illegal, and he would make himself liable to punishment.\r\n\r\nAfter the late civil war broke out, Congress for the purpose of\r\npreventing those who had voluntarily taken part in the rebellion, from\r\nholding thereafter any office under the government, passed an act\r\nrequiring every one before he could accept any office, either in the\r\ncivil, military, or naval departments, to take an oath in the following\r\nform:\r\n\r\n5. “I, A. B., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never voluntarily\r\nborne arms against the United States, since I have been a citizen\r\nthereof; that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel or\r\nencouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility thereto; that I have\r\nneither sought, nor accepted, nor attempted to exercise the functions\r\nof any office whatever, under any authority or pretended authority in\r\nhostility to the United States; that I have not yielded a voluntary\r\nsupport to any pretended government, authority, power or Constitution,\r\nwithin the United States, hostile or inimical thereto. And I do further\r\nswear (or affirm) that to the best of my knowledge and ability, I will\r\nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all\r\nenemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance\r\nto the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental\r\nreservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully\r\ndischarge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help\r\nme God.”\r\n\r\nSo strong and comprehensive an oath as this was never before required\r\nfrom any officer of the government. It answers the requirements of the\r\nConstitution, and substantially comprehends all contained in any other\r\nforms heretofore used. It is at once an oath of allegiance, an oath of\r\nsupport of the Constitution, and an oath to discharge faithfully the\r\nduties of the office taken. This goes by the name of the TEST oath, and\r\nfrequently “The Iron-clad Oath.”\r\n\r\n6. The object of the test oath was, during the Civil War, to prevent the\r\nentrance into any office of a person who might be secretly unfriendly to\r\nthe government, and use his position to the advantage of its enemies. So\r\ncomprehensive and minute an oath would allow no chance of mental evasion\r\nto a conscientious person, and would lay the offender under the liability\r\nof severe punishment. It is evidently proper to bind all officers of\r\nthe general and State governments under the strongest and most solemn\r\nobligation to a faithful and honest discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\n7. Whoever receives an office in the United States, which is connected\r\nwith the revenue in any way, so that public money passes through his\r\nhands, is required to give a bond as security for such money. These\r\nbonds give the government a claim on their property if the money is not\r\naccounted for according to the directions of the law. They are signed by\r\none or more persons who must show that they have the means to pay the\r\namount for which they become security. The amount of security required\r\ndepends on the sums of money that are to pass through the hands of the\r\nofficial, or which is likely at any time to accumulate in his possession.\r\nThe government takes all the care it can that there shall be no risk of\r\nloss of the public property, and the bond is designed to afford adequate\r\nsecurity for all that any officer may have charge of.\r\n\r\n8. By this means two important ends are gained. No person can get an\r\noffice who has no friends and no reputation for uprightness sufficient\r\nto induce those that know him to risk their own property on his honesty\r\nand faithfulness. It was designed to be a sure means for the government\r\nof finding out who were to be trusted. If he has not property himself, so\r\nthat he can secure his bondsmen to their satisfaction, he must have so\r\nhigh a character for integrity that they are willing to risk their money\r\nin his hands, or he cannot obtain an office. Security for public funds,\r\nand a high degree of personal worth are both expected to be gained by\r\nthis requirement.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this works very well indeed, in both respects, but there\r\nseems no security, that is quite infallible, against roguery, unless it\r\nbe in the extreme care of the people, and their constant watchfulness\r\nover all the affairs of the country and all the men who represent them.\r\nIt is difficult to make a house so strong that a thief cannot get into it\r\nby force or stratagem, and rogues who wish to steal from the public funds\r\nmay band together and help one another to get into office and then divide\r\nwhat spoil they can secure; or unforeseen events may bring more money\r\nthan was properly secured into an officer’s hands, or those whose duty it\r\nis to see that he disburses the funds at the right times may be careless\r\nor dishonest.\r\n\r\n9. The only sure way is to take care that none but men of proved\r\nintegrity get into office, and to take all pains to cultivate honesty\r\nin the community at large. The money lost by the government is probably\r\nmuch less in proportion than in the private business of the country.\r\nGreat watchfulness is really exercised, and when such a case occurs\r\nit is immediately known through the whole country. Not many men are\r\nwilling to run so much risk of punishment and public reprobation. Too\r\nmuch care, however, cannot be taken to prevent corruption in public\r\nlife. It destroys the purity and soundness of _character_ on which our\r\ninstitutions are founded. A republic cannot exist without a high standard\r\nof virtue.\r\n\r\n10. Every official is required to take an oath, or make a solemn\r\naffirmation to discharge the duties of his office faithfully. Though we\r\ncannot expect to be quite secure against the trickery and insincerity\r\nof false and corrupt men, yet we have reason, on the whole, to\r\ncongratulate ourselves on the general security of public property, and\r\nthe watchfulness of the people over their servants in places of trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT PRISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The United States government has always endeavored to continue, as\r\nit commenced, to rule with vigor, and to preserve a wholesome respect\r\nfor its own authority and the rights of all its citizens, while it has,\r\nbeyond all other governments, probably, that have ever existed sought to\r\navoid arbitrariness and severity; keeping in mind the principle lying\r\nat the foundation of its institutions that it exists, not for itself,\r\nbut for the good of the people. It has assumed that the people generally\r\nwould not require coercion to submit to its regulations, and has not,\r\ntherefore, made that ample provision for punishment and intimidation that\r\nis usual among governments.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this we call attention to the fact that the general\r\ngovernment does not own, and has never built, prisons for the confinement\r\nof offenders against its laws. Imprisonment, as the mildest form of\r\npunishment, has, indeed, very often been inflicted, more often than any\r\nother form of punishment. How does this occur when they own no prisons?\r\nThe answer is that they use the prisons of the States wherever they will\r\nallow it. This arrangement between the general and State governments has\r\nbeen made in nearly if not all the States; the United States paying for\r\nthe support of their prisoners.\r\n\r\n2. But in case any State should refuse to make such an agreement, the\r\nUnited States marshal of any district where a prisoner is to be confined,\r\nis authorized to procure some building where the prisoners may be safely\r\nconfined in the district where they have been tried and convicted, or\r\nwhere they have been arrested and are held for trial.\r\n\r\nThis is a far more economical plan than it would be for the United States\r\nto build prisons all over the country, and then to employ keepers of\r\nthem. It exemplifies the friendly relations existing between the States\r\nand the general government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A Proclamation is an official notice published by one high in\r\nauthority, for the purpose of giving reliable and authoritative\r\ninformation to the people that something has been done, or will soon\r\nbe done, which is important for them to know, that they may act, or\r\nrefrain from acting according to the information contained in the\r\nproclamation. These proclamations are made known to the country through\r\nthe most extensive channels of information that can be used for conveying\r\nintelligence to everybody in the Republic. In our day, and in our\r\ncountry, the newspapers are the best means that can be used for this\r\npurpose. But in ancient times, and before the art of printing was known,\r\nswift riders or runners were dispatched to every part of the kingdom\r\nor country over which the proclamation was to be made known. These\r\nmessengers carried it with them, and proclaimed it in the ears of all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n2. These documents are official acts brought before the people in due\r\nform and solemnity. Sometimes they are only recommendations; at others\r\nthey have all the force of organic law, or the acts of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt has, for some years, been the custom of the Executive to designate\r\nsome day toward the close of the year as a day of thanksgiving,\r\nrecommending the day to be observed in a religious manner. Important\r\nchanges in the commercial affairs between us and some foreign country are\r\nmade known by the same method.\r\n\r\n3. A memorable proclamation was made by President Lincoln, in 1862,\r\nby which he made known to the country, and especially to the Southern\r\nStates, that if they continued their war against the United States for\r\none hundred days after its issuance, he would then, in virtue of his\r\nauthority as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, liberate the slaves\r\nin all the seceded States. At the expiration of the time, which was on\r\nthe first of January, 1863, he issued another proclamation, in and by\r\nwhich he did emancipate all the slaves in every State which had warred\r\nagainst the United States government.\r\n\r\nThe blockading of our ports at the commencement of the civil war, and the\r\nimposition of an embargo upon our shipping, previous to the last war\r\nwith England, were both subjects which brought out proclamations from the\r\nPresident who then filled the Executive chair.\r\n\r\n4. The above examples show the character of the cases which cause\r\nproclamations to be issued. In some instances they have the authority\r\nof law; in others they are merely recommendations; and in others only\r\ncommunicate important intelligence in regard to our public affairs at\r\nhome or abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. As it is one purpose of this work to give a clear and complete account\r\nof the mode of conducting the affairs of the general government, we\r\nhave thought it best to call attention to the class of officers named\r\nat the head of this chapter; and especially since persons acting under\r\nthis title are assigned to a variety of duties, sometimes permanent and\r\nsometimes temporary. In the first place, they act as heads of bureaus\r\nin the various departments. These commissioners are permanent officials\r\nof the government, established and provided for by law; such are the\r\ncommissioners of the land office, patent office, pension office, &c.\r\n\r\n2. Another class of commissioners can hardly be considered officers,\r\nbut rather temporary or special agents. In the multifarious duties\r\ndevolving upon Congress, the President, and all the departments, it not\r\nunfrequently happens that it is impracticable for them to do certain\r\nthings necessary to be done. The business to be transacted may be at a\r\ngreat distance from the capital, even in a foreign country. In these\r\ncases commissioners are appointed to do such business. They have been\r\nappointed to negotiate a peace, to make treaties of various kinds between\r\nus and other powers, and to negotiate with the Indians for the purchase\r\nof their lands. The United States courts appoint them to take bail, or\r\nto take testimony to be used on trials, and do various other things\r\nnecessary in trials and proceedings before them.\r\n\r\n3. Congress frequently appoints commissioners to obtain information, or\r\nto investigate some matter on which they expect to legislate. In all\r\ncases they must report their proceedings, either to Congress, to the\r\nPresident, or to the head of the department under whose instruction they\r\nact. Permanent commissioners report once a year, or oftener if required,\r\nthat Congress may know the condition of affairs in their respective\r\nbureaus. Special commissioners, after they have performed the work\r\nassigned, make their report; after which their duties cease, and their\r\ncommission comes to an end.\r\n\r\n4. The lowest grade of diplomatic agents are called commissioners. We\r\nare thus represented at the present time in the Republics of Hayti and\r\nLiberia.\r\n\r\n5. By recent acts of Congress, the powers of commissioners in some cases\r\nhave been enlarged. They now examine persons charged with crimes against\r\nthe laws of the United States; hold them to bail, discharge them, or\r\ncommit them to prison; and do other magisterial acts, preliminary to the\r\ntrial of the accused. When acting in such cases, they are clothed with\r\nsome of the powers of a court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL REGISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Congress, in 1816, passed an act authorizing and requiring the\r\nSecretary of State, once in two years, to print and publish a book called\r\n“the official register,” in which he was ordered to register the name\r\nof every officer and agent of the government, in the civil, military\r\nand naval departments, including cadets and midshipmen, together with\r\nthe compensation received by each; the names of the State and county\r\nwhere born; and the name of the place where employed, whether at home or\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nTo the list of persons employed in the Navy Department, the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy is required to subjoin the names, force and condition of all\r\nthe ships and vessels belonging to the United States, and when and where\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nThis work has been published and distributed, as the law directs, ever\r\nsince the passage of the act, and is sometimes denominated “the blue\r\nbook.” It is a very convenient and useful publication, as it shows\r\nin compact form the whole official force of the government in each\r\ndepartment, together with the cost of maintaining it.\r\n\r\nAs it contains only names and dates and facts relating to persons,\r\ncomparatively few would take the pains to read it, and but a small number\r\nis published. It can be found in the Congressional library at Washington,\r\nwhere twenty-five copies of each edition are deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE STARS AND STRIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA nation’s Flag represents its sovereignty. It is adopted by its supreme\r\nauthority as a symbol or sign of itself, and wherever it waves the fact\r\nof the substantial control of that authority, at that point, is thereby\r\nasserted. If there is a struggle between two powers for control, the\r\npresence of the flag proves that the authority it represents still\r\nmaintains itself, and its subjugation is declared by lowering its flag\r\nand by the substitution of another in its place.\r\n\r\nThe flag is, therefore, an expression to the eye of the condition of\r\nthings; and attracts the sympathies and antipathies, the joys and\r\nsorrows, the hopes and fears of those interested in the sovereignty it\r\nrepresents. It is the rallying point of sentiment and of energy. The\r\naffection and reverence bestowed on our country will light up into a\r\npatriotic flame at sight of its flag. It is associated with all the\r\nheroic deeds and achievements that adorn our national history, and with\r\nthe loss of all those we honored and loved who followed and fought for\r\nit, and gave their lives in its defense. Our “Star Spangled Banner”\r\nhas been a thousand times baptized in blood dearer to us than our own,\r\nand the sight of it recalls all these sacrifices so cheerfully made to\r\nestablish or to preserve our institutions. The flag of the United States\r\nmay well call forth more enthusiastic affection, pride, and hope than\r\nany other in the world; for it symbolizes not only home, country, and\r\nassociations dear to Americans, but the justice, liberty, and right of\r\nself government that are dear to all mankind. Humanity at large has a\r\ndeep interest in it.\r\n\r\nIts history is this: Soon after the Declaration of Independence the\r\nContinental Congress appointed a committee to confer with Gen. Washington\r\nand “design a suitable flag for the nation.” After the painful and\r\ndepressing defeat on Long Island, the retreat through the Jerseys and\r\nacross the Delaware, when everything seemed lost for the new government,\r\nWashington suddenly struck the vigorous blows at Trenton and Princeton\r\nthat confounded the enemy and drove him back to Staten Island. Congress\r\nand the country were cheered with a hope and a resolution that never\r\nafterwards failed them; for in the next campaign occurred the capture of\r\nBurgoyne, followed by the treaty with France; and the close of the war in\r\nour favor was henceforth only a question of time.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May or early June, 1777, following the staggering blow\r\nWashington had given the British army in Jersey, the committee referred\r\nto above, and Washington, completed the design for a flag. This was\r\naccomplished and the first flag made at the house of a Mrs. Ross, in Arch\r\nSt., Philadelphia. The house is still standing—No. 239. She had a shop\r\nwhere she followed the “upholder” trade, as it was then called—the same\r\nas our upholstering. One day the Commander-in-chief, Hon. Geo. Ross, a\r\nrelative of hers, and certain members of Congress, called on her, with a\r\ndesign for a flag—thirteen red and white stripes, alternate with thirteen\r\nsix pointed stars—and requested her to make the flag. She consented but\r\nsuggested that the stars would be more symmetrical and more pleasing\r\nto the eye if made with five points, and folded a sheet of paper and\r\nproduced the pattern by a single cut. This was approved and she finished\r\na flag the next day. Mrs. Ross was given the position of manufacturer of\r\nflags for the government, which descended to her children.\r\n\r\nThis was the flag that led our armies to victory during the remainder of\r\nthe war, waved over the crestfallen soldiers of Burgoyne and Cornwallis,\r\nand at the mast head of John Paul Jones on the English coast. In 1794\r\nthis flag was changed, though its chief features were retained. Congress\r\nthen ordered that the flag should consist of fifteen stripes, alternate\r\nred and white, and fifteen stars, white on a blue field. There were then\r\nfifteen States. The stars and stripes were equal, and a stripe and a star\r\nwere added with the advent of each new State. This was changed in 1818,\r\nas the States increased and the flag threatened to become too large,\r\nby reducing the stripes to thirteen, representing the original Union,\r\nand the stars were made equal to the number of States. No change has\r\nsince been made except to add a star whenever the union increased by the\r\nadmission of a State.\r\n\r\n“The Star Spangled Banner,” a stirring patriotic song which is to\r\nAmericans what the “Marseillaise” is to the French, was composed by\r\nthe author during the cannonade of Fort McHenry, near Baltimore, by\r\nthe British fleet co-operating with an army which was to attack it,\r\nsimultaneously with the fall of the fort, by land, Sept. 13th, 1814. The\r\npoet had gone on board the fleet under a flag of truce before the attack\r\nbegan, to negotiate about some prisoners, and was obliged to remain\r\nuntil the next day, the cannonade continuing during the night. If the\r\nfort surrendered Baltimore would be taken; and the fate of Washington,\r\npillaged and burned a few days before, filled the people with the anxiety\r\nwhich is expressed by the poet, to know if the flag still waved in the\r\nmorning “over the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.” The joy\r\nof all America may be conceived when Admiral Cockrane drew off his\r\nfleet and took the British army on board, while the “Stars and Stripes”\r\ncontinued to float gaily on the breeze over Fort McHenry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The use of seals to give authority to documents, and to establish\r\ntheir genuineness, comes down to us from a remote antiquity. It is much\r\neasier to counterfeit a signature alone, than the impression of a seal,\r\nand when both occur on a document it is considered fairly safe to be\r\nrelied on as a sign of authority.\r\n\r\nThey are usually emblematic of some event, or sentiment attaching to the\r\nhistory or prevailing tendency and feeling of a country. They are used\r\non documents or papers issued by the government. Some of the Departments\r\nhave a special seal for their own use, in cases where the signature of\r\nthe President is not required. If it is not affixed to the proper papers\r\nthey fail to become legal and have no authority.\r\n\r\n2. The usual mode of affixing the seal formerly was by placing melted wax\r\non the paper and pressing the seal on it giving a fac simile or perfect\r\nrepresentation of it. As this required time and business increased with\r\nthe growth of the country, Congress passed an act making it lawful to\r\naffix the seal by making the impression directly on paper.\r\n\r\nThe custody of the Great Seal is with the Secretary of State, whose duty\r\nit is to affix it to all civil commissions issued to officers of the\r\nUnited States appointed by the President and Senate, or by the President\r\nalone. But it is forbidden to be affixed before the President has signed\r\nit. The seal alone without the signature has no value. It is used to show\r\nthe genuineness of the President’s signature.\r\n\r\n3. The Secretary of State and all the other secretaries of the great\r\ndepartments, each have a seal of office which is affixed to commissions,\r\nand to other instruments emanating from their respective offices.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the most important bureaus are required by law to have seals\r\nof office; for example, the Land Office and the Patent Office. When the\r\nUnited States gives a patent (title) to land, it must be sealed by the\r\nLand Office seal. A patent right must be issued under the seal of the\r\nPatent Office.\r\n\r\n4. One of the most common and important uses of seals arises from the\r\nnecessity people are often under to have copies of records, maps,\r\nand various other papers, the originals of which are in some of the\r\ndepartments at Washington, to be used as evidence in courts, where trials\r\nand other legal proceedings are pending. In order to provide for this\r\nnecessity, Congress has enacted that copies of such records, maps and\r\npapers belonging to any of the government offices, under the signature of\r\nthe head of such office, or of its chief clerk, with the seal affixed,\r\nshall be as competent evidence in all cases as their originals would be.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE GREAT SEAL.\r\n\r\n1. Soon after the formal establishment of the Republic by the Declaration\r\nof Independence, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson were\r\nappointed a committee to prepare a seal. They employed an artist and\r\nfurnished various devices; Jefferson combining them all at the request\r\nof the others. The paper still exists in the office of the Secretary of\r\nState at Washington. They reported Aug. 10th, 1776, but for some unknown\r\nreason, probably neglect, it was not acted on.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 another committee was appointed, to make a device. They reported\r\nMay 10th, 1780. It was not acceptable, and was recommitted, being again\r\nreported a year afterwards, but not adopted. In 1782 a third committee\r\nwas appointed, but could not satisfy Congress in their report. It was\r\nthen referred to the Secretary of Congress, Charles Thomson, who procured\r\nvarious devices that were unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nAfter vainly striving to perfect a seal which should meet the approval\r\nof Congress, Thomson finally received from John Adams, then in London,\r\nan exceedingly simple and appropriate device, suggested by Sir John\r\nPrestwitch, a baronet of the West of England, who was a warm friend of\r\nAmerica, and an accomplished antiquarian. It consisted of an escutcheon\r\nbearing thirteen perpendicular stripes, white and red, with the chief\r\nblue, and spangled with thirteen stars; and, to give it greater\r\nconsequence, he proposed to place it on the breast of an American eagle,\r\ndisplayed, without supporters, as emblematic of self-reliance. It met\r\nwith general approbation, in and out of Congress, and was adopted in\r\nJune, 1782; so it is manifest, although the fact is not extensively\r\nknown, that we are indebted for our national arms to a titled aristocrat\r\nof the country with which we were then at war. Eschewing all heraldic\r\ntechnicalities, it may be thus described in plain English: Thirteen\r\nperpendicular pieces, white and red; a blue field; the escutcheon on the\r\nbreast of the American eagle displayed, holding in his right talon an\r\nolive-branch, and in his left a bundle of thirteen arrows, and in his\r\nbeak a scroll, inscribed with the motto _E Pluribus Unum_. For the crest,\r\nover the head of the eagle, which appears above the escutcheon, a golden\r\nglory breaking through a cloud, and surrounding thirteen stars, forming a\r\nconstellation of white stars on a blue field.\r\n\r\n_Reverse._—A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith, an eye in a triangle,\r\nsurrounded with a glory. Over the eye, the words _Annuit Cœptis_—“God\r\nhas favored the undertaking.” On the base of the pyramid, are the\r\nnumeral Roman letters MDCCLXXVI; and underneath the motto, _Novus Ordo\r\nSeculorum_—“A New Series of Ages”—denoting that a new order of things had\r\ncommenced in the Western hemisphere. Thus, after many fruitless efforts,\r\nfor nearly six years, a very simple seal was adopted, and yet remains the\r\narms of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The origin of law varies with the character or class of the government\r\nunder which it is made. Where all authority is concentrated in the hands\r\nof one man his will becomes law whenever expressed, or when expressed\r\nin some regular and formal way. More generally laws are originated, in\r\nour days, in civilized countries where there is a monarchial government,\r\nby the ruler in conjunction with representatives of the people or some\r\nclasses of them. In point of fact, rulers are always obliged to regard\r\nthe habits, traditions, and feelings of the people more or less, or they\r\nmay be obliged by a revolution, or the intrigues of the ambitious founded\r\non their discontent, to retire to private life. The real prominence\r\nof the people in their governments is constantly becoming greater in\r\nall civilized lands, and it seems highly probable that, before many\r\ngenerations have passed, all governments not founded on an acknowledgment\r\nof the Sovereignty of the People will be incapable of maintaining\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n2. In the United States of America the source of all authority, and the\r\norigin of all law, is in the people alone. The fact that laws are made\r\nby Representatives does not alter the principle at all. They are simply\r\nthe substitutes or agents of the people. Where there are many people any\r\nother than a Representative Democracy is impossible. These are chosen\r\nfrom among their equals, and when their term of office has expired return\r\nto the common level. If they are ambitious of more than one term of\r\noffice they must take special care not to offend the majority that first\r\nelected them.\r\n\r\n3. The first signal exercise of the law making power by the people was in\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution as the Fundamental Law. This established\r\nthe character of the government, prescribed the duties and limits of\r\nthe legislative and executive branches, and organized a third branch to\r\nwatch over the action of the other two and keep it in harmony with the\r\nConstitution. This Instrument then became the source or foundation of all\r\n_special law_. It is a comprehensive statement of the will of the people,\r\nbut it may be changed or enlarged in a prescribed way. It is binding on\r\nall legislators and executives. Whatever may be enacted or done by them\r\nnot in accord with it is null and void; the Supreme Court being bound so\r\nto announce when the fact shall be proved before it. The Constitution\r\nis the Law of the Land. Any laws enacted by Congress, or by State\r\nLegislatures, not contrary to it, are valid and binding; but any attempt\r\nto set aside any of its provisions, or disregard its true intent, would\r\nbe usurpation and a violation of the rights of the people. The term State\r\nSovereignty can, consequently, be true only in a limited and secondary\r\nsense, this being a higher Sovereignty still.\r\n\r\n4. The larger part of the general laws by which we are governed are made\r\nby Congress, that body having been instituted to that special end. It\r\nis composed of a popular House, or one chosen directly by the people,\r\nand one more select, chosen by the State Legislatures to represent their\r\nStates as a whole. If the Legislature represents the will of the people\r\nof the State accurately, as it always does unless some change in popular\r\nopinion takes place suddenly after it has been elected, the Senators as\r\nwell as Representatives will embody the views of the people in their\r\nrespective States. So we see that the people are Sovereign and law really\r\noriginates with them. Laws, indeed, may be made by their agents that do\r\nnot suit them; but, if they cannot induce them to repeal such laws by\r\npetition, remonstrance, or otherwise, at once, by waiting a little until\r\nthe terms of such members expire they can replace them by others pledged\r\nto carry out their views. Thus the general policy of the government is\r\ndetermined by the people at the general elections. They give the law\r\nto the law makers, and appoint the executives who will administer them\r\nin the spirit they approve. The whole matter is within their control\r\nas a point of power, and still more so from the natural deference the\r\nRepresentatives of the people feel toward the wishes of those on whose\r\nfavor they depend. The deep indignation or contempt of their fellow\r\nmen will seldom be incurred, even if they have no ambition for further\r\nelectoral honors.\r\n\r\n5. The treaties made by the President, which require to be ratified\r\nby the Senate to become binding, and the approval of the House of\r\nRepresentatives if money is required to carry them into effect—since only\r\nthat branch can dispose of the property of the country, or originate laws\r\nfor raising money—have also the force of general laws. The whole country\r\nis bound to act in conformity with their provisions. We have, then, three\r\nkinds of law, or laws from three different sources that are alike binding\r\non the whole country: the Constitution, which is unchangeable except by\r\nvote of the Legislatures or conventions of three-fourths of the States;\r\nthe laws of Congress, which may be made and repealed at their pleasure;\r\nand treaty law, which involves the consent of a foreign State, but\r\nrequires the assent of the President and one or both bodies of Congress,\r\nand which may be abrogated or modified at the united pleasure of all the\r\nparties concerned in making it.\r\n\r\n6. There is a fourth species of law more general still and more or less\r\nof which is often involved in treaties with foreign governments. This\r\nis the Law of Nations, or the principles acknowledged by all civilized\r\nnations as binding on them in their intercourse with each other. The only\r\nbinding force it possesses is in the general practice of mankind, and\r\nthe authority of public opinion. This is commonly effective, since all\r\nlaw depends really on the approval of the people for its efficacy, or at\r\nleast on their silent submission if they disapprove.\r\n\r\n7. In every State in the Union the people elect a Legislative body which\r\nmakes such local laws as the people wish to be governed by, and as their\r\nspecial circumstances require; but they are not permitted to legislate\r\non general questions, to make any law contrary to the Constitution,\r\nor to the laws of Congress, nor are its laws binding on any but the\r\ncitizens of the State in which they are made, or such others as may\r\nbe residing there. Each State has a Constitution which determines the\r\nspecial organization of its government, and limits and defines the powers\r\nof its different branches; but it is required to be in harmony with the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The Constitution, Legislature and\r\nofficers of a State are determined by vote of its people.\r\n\r\n8. After this examination we reach this conclusion: That there is no\r\ninstitution in the United States that has not been virtually established\r\nby the people, its fundamental law was adopted by them of their own\r\nfree will and may be changed when they see fit; and that if all the\r\nlaws, of whatever kind, that are binding on them, are not such as they\r\nprefer, they are, at least, originally responsible for them, and have\r\nin their hands the means of changing them within a reasonably short\r\nperiod. In fact their demand or the zeal of their Representatives for\r\ntheir interests usually originates whatever laws are made. The constant\r\ngeneral prosperity of the country since the establishment of the present\r\ngovernment, the increase of intelligence and self respect among the\r\npeople, and the beneficial influence exerted by the United States on the\r\nworld tend to confirm and settle its principles and laws on a permanent\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The laws of any nation are the rules by which it is governed, a\r\nviolation of which renders the offender liable to the infliction of\r\ncertain penalties. These laws, in many nations, are carefully and\r\nsystematically arranged in the beginning, as in the United States; in\r\nothers, as in England, they are gradually produced, the course taken in\r\ndealing with the first of a class of similar cases furnishing a precedent\r\nthat is equal in force to a general law.\r\n\r\n2. From very early times the different nations who had intercourse with\r\neach other began to follow certain rules, which commonly originated\r\nin the mode last mentioned above; and many of them became generally\r\nrecognized as the proper guide in international intercourse. These\r\ncustoms came, at length, to be called the Law of Nations. Writers of\r\neminence carefully investigated them, and studied the principles on which\r\nthey were founded. These writers are held to be authorities as to this\r\nlaw, and the principles they have laid down are generally acknowledged,\r\nby civilized nations in modern times, as the standard of International\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\n3. There is no possibility, in the present state of the world, of\r\norganizing a tribunal with authority to impose penalties for violations\r\nof this law by individual nations; though it is to be hoped that may\r\nsome time be the case. The only representative of such a tribunal is the\r\ngeneral opinion of the civilized world; and nations must, themselves,\r\nact as supreme judges and executors of the law as it applies (or as they\r\nchoose to hold it as applying) to their disputes. When they cannot come\r\nto an agreement with their adversaries, they commonly Declare War, and\r\nendeavor to right themselves by force.\r\n\r\n4. This is not, by any means, an equitable or satisfactory way of\r\navenging wrongs. The aggressor may be the strongest; and the offense, in\r\nthat case, will be greatly increased. It causes the penalty, in any case,\r\nto fall very heavily on many innocent heads, and produces lamentable and\r\nwide-spread desolation. Yet it is sometimes better than tame submission;\r\nand the right to make war when grievous wrong has been suffered, or\r\nindignity offered to the national honor, is recognized by the Law of\r\nNations; and certain rules are applied by it as a guide in honorable\r\nwarfare. There is nothing but self-respect, and respect for the opinions\r\nof the civilized world, to keep belligerent nations within the limits of\r\nthese rules. They are, however, continually becoming better defined, and\r\nPublic Opinion has more and more weight in each succeeding generation.\r\n\r\n5. Some of the more important features of International Law (or the Law\r\nof Nations) are, that every nation has the right to regulate her own\r\ninternal affairs without interference from others, unless some of these\r\nregulations may seriously affect the interests of a foreign power; that\r\nnational boundaries are to be respected; that bodies of water lying\r\nwithin a national territory, and the seacoast for three miles from the\r\nshore, are under its exclusive jurisdiction; and that a nation may take\r\nmeasures to protect its own citizens who may be traveling or doing\r\nbusiness in other countries, unless they violate its laws; and then it\r\nmay first examine the case before the accused is given up for trial and\r\npunishment to a foreign court. There are many other rules. These will\r\nserve as examples.\r\n\r\n6. One class of these laws requires special mention, because they are\r\noften more carefully defined than most other international customs. These\r\nare Neutrality Laws. Those now in force in the United States were enacted\r\nin 1818. They are only a formal recognition by our highest legislative\r\nauthority—Congress—of the Law of Nations as generally accepted by other\r\ngovernments. The leading regulations are, that our citizens shall not\r\ninterfere, but at their own risk and peril, in contests between other\r\nnations; that no armament shall be fitted out in our territory for the\r\npurpose of making war on any power with which we are at peace; and\r\nmaking it unlawful for an American vessel to carry “Contraband of War”\r\n(or war material) to either of two warring nations. It forbids granting\r\nto one nation rights not allowed to the other with which it is at war.\r\nNeutrality Laws are designed to avoid causes of unfriendly feeling, and\r\nto prevent the improper interference of our citizens in the quarrels of\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\n7. Our government believed itself wronged in the course of the recent\r\nCivil War by England. It claimed that the English government had not\r\nbeen at proper pains to preserve a neutral attitude; and complaint being\r\nmade, the two governments agreed to appoint a Commission to examine and\r\narbitrate the case—the decision, whatever it might be, to be accepted\r\nby both parties. This was done, at Geneva, in Switzerland; and probably\r\nprevented a war between the two countries. It is to be hoped that\r\nall national disputes may hereafter be settled in this reasonable and\r\nChristian way.\r\n\r\n8. Treaties are international laws binding on the two or more parties\r\nmaking the contract; and our Foreign Representatives (as ambassadors,\r\nministers resident, etc.) deal with International Law as arranged by\r\ntreaties and the Laws of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO RELIGION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Religion has always exerted so much influence on men that it has been\r\ncustomary for governments to assume more or less control over it; and,\r\nas the leaders of religious systems have commonly been glad to get the\r\nsupport of governments, there has usually existed what is called a “Union\r\nof Church and State,” the government endorsing the views of some special\r\nreligious system, and giving more or less support to its officials;\r\nsometimes, even refusing to tolerate any other; or, if tolerated,\r\nreserving its special recognition and favors, and whatever material\r\nsupport it chose to give to religious establishments to that termed\r\nNational, alone; that church returning the favor by using its great\r\ninfluence with the people to support the measures of the government.\r\n\r\nIt is very distasteful to many men who differ from the views of the\r\nfavored system to be required to support it, and to be frowned upon by\r\nthe government if they do not feel inclined to connect themselves with it.\r\n\r\n2. The Founders of our government were wise enough to leave the people\r\nto arrange religious questions according to their pleasure. They were\r\nnot unbelievers in religion, but thought, as most of our citizens now\r\nthink, that entire liberty should be left to all to act in religious\r\nmatters as they felt able and inclined. All religious systems are equally\r\ntolerated—no government support is given specially to any. Some people\r\ndo not approve of religious oaths (an affirmation in the name of God, or\r\ncalling God to witness that what is said is true,) and from such persons\r\na solemn affirmation or statement, answers the purposes of the law.\r\n\r\nAlthough neither the Constitution, nor Congress in its laws, prescribe a\r\nreligious profession of any kind, and the Constitution prohibits Congress\r\nfrom making laws respecting the establishment of a State religion, or\r\ninterfering with the free exercise of it, and declares that “no religious\r\ntest shall ever be required, as a qualification to any office or public\r\ntrust, under the United States,” neither do they discourage religion.\r\nRespect is shown, in many ways, to religion. Congress usually appoints\r\na chaplain, now of one denomination, and now of another; it allows\r\nchaplains in the army and navy, and provides them a salary; and, of late\r\nyears, the President recommends a day of National thanksgiving to God\r\nonce a year, for the blessings we enjoy, and sometimes proclaims a day\r\nof fasting and prayer. It shows all due respect to the religious beliefs\r\namong the people, but leaves all free to practice any form of it, or to\r\nreject them all.\r\n\r\n3. Entire religious liberty is a rarity in the world, and is much more\r\nfavorable to the purity and weighty influence of religious teachings than\r\na State religion. Many of the colonies that afterwards became States,\r\nwere founded by persons who fled from religious persecution in the\r\ncountries of the Old World, and multitudes have emigrated here to secure\r\nfreedom in the enjoyment of their religious views and practices, or even\r\nentire freedom to reject all religion if they could not believe in any,\r\nthough that is seldom the case.\r\n\r\nOur example has been much approved and is having much influence on other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLERATION OF OPINIONS,\r\n\r\n4. Is characteristic of the American Government. Liberty of the Press,\r\nor freedom to state any views a man may entertain, is as complete as\r\nliberty in religious matters. Very severe things are sometimes written\r\nand published of the government, and sometimes things that would do\r\nmuch harm if they were generally believed, and no notice is taken of it,\r\nunless some one sees fit to contradict it or prove it to be incorrect.\r\n\r\nIf a man injures another’s character by writing things that are false,\r\nhe can be tried, and, if convicted, punished by the courts. Vile and\r\nindecent writings are prohibited; but otherwise there is entire freedom.\r\nFalsehood and error are left to be destroyed in a natural way by the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThis is a great gain to the truth since error has often been protected,\r\nin other countries, by government authority, on the conviction that it\r\nwas the truth, to the great prejudice of truth itself.\r\n\r\n5. Although, during the Civil War, there was some restraint put upon the\r\nfreedom of publishing things that might be hurtful to the government, the\r\ninstances were not very numerous, and, at the close of the war the spirit\r\nof toleration was shown in a way very creditable to our people, and very\r\npraiseworthy in our government, which left the way open to a speedier\r\nreunion of sentiment and sympathy in the sections that had fought each\r\nother so bravely.\r\n\r\nThe brave and resolute can afford to be just to each other, and to allow\r\nentire freedom of opinion to all. In this respect we have fairly earned\r\nthe right to call ourselves a nation of freemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nCHAPLAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Regard to the religious habits of a large number of the people has led\r\nCongress to appoint, or permit the appointment, of chaplains to supply\r\nsuch religious instruction and services in the army and navy as might be\r\nfelt desirable by those concerned.\r\n\r\nThough chaplains are not properly officers of the government, they are\r\nemployees of it, for they are appointed by its authority, and paid from\r\nits treasury. Those in the army receive the same pay and emoluments as\r\na major of infantry; or this was the compensation allowed by act of\r\nCongress in 1812. But by an act of 1862, it was fixed at $100 per month,\r\nand two rations per day, for those in the army or hospitals. By the act\r\nof 1812, one chaplain was allowed to every brigade; but by an act of 1861\r\n(during the civil war,) one for every regiment was allowed.\r\n\r\nNavy chaplains, in 1835, received $1,200 per year. But in 1860 this was\r\nraised to a lieutenant’s pay; and this in 1862 was $1,800 per annum.\r\n\r\nChaplains in Congress receive $750 per annum.\r\n\r\n2. The United States also employ a chaplain in the military academy at\r\nWest Point.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that in time of war, with one\r\nchaplain for every regiment, and one for every ship of war, and others\r\nin hospitals and military posts, quite a large number of clergymen are\r\nemployed by the government.\r\n\r\nThis provision for the religious instruction of those who cannot, from\r\ntheir peculiar position, attend the preaching of the Gospel, or other\r\nreligious services, is certainly an indication that our government\r\nrespects religion, and looks after the spiritual as well as the temporal\r\ninterests of its army and navy.\r\n\r\n3. In the appointment of chaplains, the government pursues a liberal\r\ncourse. No particular preference is given to any denomination, but\r\nthey are appointed from almost every religious sect, and allowed to\r\nconduct religious services after the forms of the church to which they\r\nrespectively belong.\r\n\r\nEvery body knows what the duties of a chaplain are. So we need not\r\nexplain them here, and will only add that a faithful chaplain in the\r\narmy in time of war has much to do besides preaching and holding\r\nregular services. The wounded, the sick, and the dying, should be\r\nthe particular objects of his attention. He should not only minister\r\nreligious instruction and consolation to them, but look after their\r\nphysical comforts. Many of these clergymen, during the late most\r\nunfortunate civil war, distinguished themselves by their exertions to\r\npromote the bodily comforts of those unfortunate men, as well as to give\r\nthem religious instruction, not refusing to nurse the sick and wounded\r\nwherever they could relieve their pains or mitigate their sufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCOMPROMISES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In a large and prosperous country there are very likely to arise\r\nantagonisms of interest and sentiment which will require the strong\r\npressure of some common and more imperative interest to overawe and\r\nreconcile by a process of mutual concession, called Compromise.\r\n\r\nThe States of the two sections—North and South—were unlike in several\r\ngeneral respects; but it was in nothing so marked as in regard to\r\nSlavery. This system was introduced in Virginia in the same year that\r\nthe Plymouth colony was founded in Massachusetts, and spread to all the\r\ncolonies, in time; but never was much practiced north of Maryland. In all\r\nthe Southern colonies it took deep root from the first. It formed the\r\nsubject of the most difficult\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPROMISE OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n2. This compromise consisted of concessions made by each section. The\r\nNorth conceded the return of fugitives from their Southern masters, when\r\nescaped to the north, and an enumeration of three-fifths of the slave\r\npopulation in computing the representation in Congress. This was a great\r\nsacrifice for that section to make, for its people were, at heart, deeply\r\nhostile to Slavery. Both their interests and sentiments made it important\r\nto exclude it from the new States where they were likely to settle in\r\nconsiderable numbers. But a close and strong union of the States was\r\na vital point with them. Commerce, trade, and manufactures, to which\r\nthey were largely given, required resources and vigor in the central\r\ngovernment, to maintain the public credit at home, and secure respect and\r\nsafety abroad. The South conceded the final close of the Slave Trade at\r\na given time (1808). Outside of the Constitution it, at the same time,\r\nconceded the “Ordinance of 1787,” by which Slavery was excluded from the\r\nterritory north of the Ohio river. Thus the North and South divided the\r\ncountry between them.\r\n\r\n3. This was, however, a very troublesome subject, and affected so many\r\nlegislative questions as to be constantly coming up for debate. The\r\nsentiments of the Northern people grew more hostile to the institution,\r\nand the South stood on guard with growing apprehension and anger, as\r\nthis state of feeling developed in the North; and, at the same time, it\r\nbecame evident that the more rapid growth of the northern population gave\r\nthem an increasing preponderance in Congressional representation. They\r\njealously watched over the rights of the State governments from their\r\nfear of Congressional or executive interference, and industriously sought\r\nmeans to extend their area and increase the number of Slave States.\r\nThey were always much assisted by a large party in the north of those\r\nwho cherished the Union and were fearful of its dissolution. They were\r\never pouring oil on the troubled waters, and mediating between the two\r\nextremes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSOURI COMPROMISE.\r\n\r\n4. The arrangement of the Slavery question so termed was made in 1820,\r\nand took effect as to the State of Missouri in 1821. In the five years\r\nthat followed the close of the last war with England there was great\r\nactivity in settlement of the unoccupied territory, and the country\r\ngave indications of the power of rapid development that has so strongly\r\ncharacterized it since. The South foresaw the loss of its balance of\r\npower if too many of the new States were organized as free. Missouri\r\nhad included a clause in her Constitution, presented for the approval\r\nof Congress, prohibiting slavery. This clause the South demanded should\r\nbe stricken out. It produced great excitement and hot discussion\r\nthroughout the country, and seemed to threaten the stability of the\r\nUnion. Both sections were resolute in maintaining their principle, but\r\nboth appreciated the necessity of strength in the government and harmony\r\nbetween the sections, and each made a sacrifice for the sake of these.\r\nMissouri was required to admit slavery, and the condition was annexed\r\nthat no more Slave States should be formed north of its southern line.\r\nThis was a concession trying to both sides. The North became a party to\r\nthe extension of Slavery, and the South gave definite limits to her power\r\nof expansion. Each, however, gained something: the South a State above\r\nthe limits before virtually fixed, and the North a definite and final\r\nlimit to the extension of a hated institution. This was quite generally\r\nsatisfactory, and for many years set that question at rest.\r\n\r\n5. “Mason and Dixon’s Line” was the term applied to the boundary between\r\nthe Free and Slave States. This name originated in colonial times.\r\nThe royal grants to colonial proprietors or companies were often very\r\ncarelessly made, and those to Lord Baltimore, the founder of Maryland,\r\nand William Penn, the proprietor of Pennsylvania, were specially\r\nindefinite, giving rise to adverse claims that nearly produced war along\r\nthe border. Commissioners were at length appointed, who employed Mason\r\nand Dixon, eminent English astronomers and surveyors, to establish the\r\nboundary, which they did satisfactorily. The importance of the question\r\nsettled, and the reputation of the surveyors for scientific accuracy,\r\nattached their name to the boundary permanently. It acquired political\r\nsignificance afterwards, as the boundary between Maryland, the most\r\nnorthern of the slave States, and Pennsylvania, the most southern of the\r\noriginal free States. When new States were formed, with the Ohio river as\r\na boundary from its point of departure out of Pennsylvania, that name was\r\nextended in its application to the whole dividing line between the free\r\nand slave States—south or north of Mason and Dixon’s Line meaning, in\r\nslave or free territory.\r\n\r\n6. After some years the southern statesmen began again to feel\r\napprehensive of a loss of their equality of power in the general\r\ngovernment, so rapidly did the northern territories fill up. They began\r\nto look for more territory, and favored the settlement, independence,\r\nand annexation of Texas. Though long resisted, they succeeded in the\r\nelection of 1844, with this annexation and a probable war with Mexico as\r\ntest questions, and added not only Texas but New Mexico and California\r\nto the territory wherein slavery, by the Missouri Compromise, would be\r\nadmissible.\r\n\r\n7. Their satisfaction was not very durable. The discovery of gold in\r\nCalifornia filled it with inhabitants so soon, and these so largely from\r\nthe free States, that in two years from its definite acquisition it\r\npetitioned for admission into the Union with a clause in its Constitution\r\nprohibiting Slavery. This was very exasperating to the South, and\r\nafter a long and violent contest could be carried by the North only by\r\nthe passage of the Fugitive Slave Law—a re-enactment of a part of the\r\nCompromise of the Constitution with provisions so vigorous and effective,\r\ncould they have been enforced, as to be, in the highest degree, offensive\r\nto a considerable part of the northern people. Utah was given a\r\nTerritorial government as a concession to the South, and the Slave Trade\r\nwas abolished in the District of Columbia as her corresponding concession\r\nto the North. These were the four compromise measures of 1850, the result\r\nof a discussion lasting nearly a year, engendering great bitterness on\r\nboth sides, and failing to satisfy either.\r\n\r\n8. The attempt to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law proved ineffectual, in\r\nthe end; the rooted aversion of the Northern people to Slavery, kept\r\nin abeyance before by less offensive compromises, being fully aroused.\r\nThis produced in the Southern people a bitter indignation as showing a\r\ndisposition to rebel against a constitutional provision in their favor.\r\nThey procured, in 1854, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in the\r\nfamous “Kansas and Nebraska Bill,” and sought to introduce Slavery into\r\nKansas. A civil war in that Territory followed, which resulted in\r\nthe triumph of the Northern party. The extinction of Slavery was now\r\napparently but a question of time, the hostility to it in the North\r\nbecoming so out-spoken and averse to Compromises acceptable to the South,\r\nthat they began to look forward to separation, which they endeavored to\r\naccomplish from 1860-5. A civil war, such as only Americans could wage,\r\nwas carried on during these years. The resolution, bravery, and military\r\ntalents of either side were never excelled; but the resources of the\r\nNorth seemed inexhaustible. Her numbers, activity, and the inventive\r\ngenius of her skilled artisans gave her an immense superiority. This\r\nwar is a cause at once of pride and grief to every true American. In\r\nthe contest Slavery, the cause of it, disappeared, the Constitution was\r\namended, and the necessity of Compromises on this question forever ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTREASON.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This is an offense aiming at the existence of the government; and\r\nin all other governments it has ever been customary to punish it with\r\nextreme severity. Many things are considered to be of the nature\r\nof treason, and, as such, severely punished in most countries. The\r\nConstitution defines treason to be “levying war against the United\r\nStates, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort;”\r\nso that the highest or capital crime alone may be pursued with its\r\npenalties. This is another evidence of the extreme moderation of the\r\nfounders of the government, which we have had occasion to notice so often\r\nin our examination.\r\n\r\n2. An act of Congress passed April 30th, 1790, defines it in the same\r\nsense and orders that the convicted offender shall be hung.\r\n\r\nBy another act passed 17th July, 1862, it was made discretionary with the\r\ncourt trying the case to put the offender to death, or to imprison him\r\nfor not less than five years, and to fine him for a sum not less than ten\r\nthousand dollars. The penalty for this crime, even in its mildest form,\r\nis very severe; thus showing how atrocious this offense is considered.\r\n\r\n3. None but a person owing allegiance to the United States can commit\r\ntreason against them. The same acts which would be treason in a citizen\r\nwould not be treason if perpetrated by a foreigner.\r\n\r\n“Misprision of treason” is the concealment of it by a person who knows it\r\nhas been committed. This also is a grave offense, and is punishable by a\r\nseven years’ imprisonment, and a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n4. Any person tried for treason, must be indicted by a grand jury, and\r\ntried by a petit jury in the Circuit Court of the United States within\r\nthree years after the crime has been committed; otherwise it is barred by\r\nlimitation—or, in other words, outlawed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Geography proper describes the general character of a country, as its\r\nrivers, bays, gulfs, plains, mountains and natural divisions. Leaving\r\nthis to other works we confine ourselves to those divisions made by the\r\ngovernment for convenience in administering its affairs.\r\n\r\nFormerly there was a separation into North and South, by “Mason and\r\nDixon’s Line,” between which there existed a marked difference of\r\ngovernmental, social, and industrial policy. The States south of that\r\nline might hold slaves, while in those north of it that institution was\r\nillegal. That difference was abolished by the thirteenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution, as a result of the Civil War. The next largest—and these\r\nexist now—are those made by the\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUIT COURTS.\r\n\r\n2. These often comprise several States and are changed, by act of\r\nCongress, when the convenience of the Associate Judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt, who preside over them requires it. The next largest political\r\ndivisions are\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATES.\r\n\r\n3. These exercise sovereign powers in all matters where control has not\r\nbeen expressly delegated by the Constitution to the National Congress.\r\nThe other political boundaries are ever liable to change, to meet the\r\nrequirements of changing circumstances. These are definitely fixed, any\r\nchange being very rare and unlikely after they are duly organized and\r\nadmitted into the Union as States. Each of the original thirteen colonies\r\nbecame States, with the boundaries they had as colonies at the time of\r\nthe Revolutionary War. The others received such boundaries as suited\r\nthe convenience and wishes of the people when they were admitted. Their\r\nobject is to prevent the centralization of too much power in the general\r\ngovernment, and to render legislation on local affairs and interests\r\nmore convenient, and more satisfactory to the people of each State. The\r\nState having the least number of inhabitants numbers between 40,000 and\r\n50,000; the one having the largest number contains between 4,000,000 and\r\n5,000,000. The number of the States determines the number of Senators in\r\nCongress, two being allotted to each; so that a State may be considered\r\nas a Senatorial District.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRICT COURTS\r\n\r\n4. Produce another class of political divisions. These attend to legal\r\ndifferences involving the laws of the general government, but of a\r\nsecondary class. They are more numerous than the Circuit Courts. In some\r\nStates there is but one, and some have several, according to size and\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\n5. Another class of districts has been formed, for the purpose of\r\ncollecting the duties on imported goods. These are called “collection\r\ndistricts.” They extend along, and embrace the whole sea coast and the\r\nshores of navigable lakes and rivers. In a few instances they are located\r\ninland, at points where goods may be brought into the United States\r\nby land. Each collection district has a port of entry, and very often\r\nseveral ports of delivery; also a collector of customs, and generally a\r\ncustom house.\r\n\r\n6. Another class of collection districts was formed during the late civil\r\nwar. They grew out of the war, and were established for the collection\r\nof the tax termed the “internal revenue,” which had to be levied to pay\r\nthe war expenses. These districts differ entirely, both in their objects\r\nand in the territory embraced within them, from those established for\r\nthe purpose of collecting duties on imports, and correspond as far as\r\npracticable with the Congressional districts in each State.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\n7. Land districts may also be noticed among these divisions. In every\r\nState and Territory where there are public lands for sale, after they are\r\nsurveyed and mapped, they are divided into districts—two, three or four,\r\nin each State and Territory—as convenience and economy may dictate. In\r\neach district a land office is established for the sale of the lands in\r\nsaid district.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT HOUSE DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\n8. Again, the whole of our sea coasts, both on the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans, together with the shores of the navigable lakes and rivers, are\r\ndivided into twelve light house districts (or their number must not\r\nexceed that,) for the purpose of building, repairing, illuminating and\r\nsuperintending the light houses on all the coasts and shores wherever\r\nlocated. These are the principal divisions we have to notice. It is\r\nimportant to have a knowledge of them, for with such knowledge we can\r\nbetter understand how government affairs are conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY OF THE U. S. FROM 1783 TO 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n1783.\r\n\r\nWashington’s army had lain in camp at Newburg, N. Y., since the surrender\r\nof Cornwallis. The Preliminary treaty of peace was signed Jan. 20th, at\r\nParis; but it was not officially announced in the camp at Newburg, until\r\nApril 19th; just eight years from the Battle of Lexington that commenced\r\nit!\r\n\r\n    July—Congress prepared to disband the army, and Washington\r\n      to resign his commission as Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n    ” 21—The great difficulty Congress had to contend with was\r\n      raising money to pay the troops. Congress had no authority,\r\n      under the Confederation, to lay taxes or impose duties. It\r\n      exhausted its own credit in the issue of paper money which\r\n      soon became of little value. It made some foreign loans, and\r\n      persuaded the States, which alone could lay taxes, to raise a\r\n      small sum. But this did not suffice to pay the army at last.\r\n      There was much suffering and discontent.\r\n\r\n      On this day a body of soldiers, in large part new recruits,\r\n      who had comparatively little to complain of, without\r\n      muskets, but wearing side arms, beset the doors of Congress\r\n      in Philadelphia, for three hours. No violence was offered.\r\n      Congress adjourned to Princeton, N. J.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 3—The final and definite Treaty of Peace between\r\n      England, France, and the United States, in which the\r\n      independence of the latter was acknowledged, its boundaries\r\n      defined, and various matters of interest arranged to the\r\n      profit of the United States, was signed at Paris.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 2—A proclamation is issued by Congress for disbanding\r\n      the army.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—The British troops evacuate New York, and it is occupied\r\n      by American troops under Gen. Knox.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 4—Long Island and Staten Island abandoned by the\r\n      British. Washington takes leave of his officers, at New York.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—He resigns his commission to Congress, in a public\r\n      audience, given him at Annapolis, Md., where Congress was\r\n      then sitting, and goes home to Mt. Vernon.\r\n\r\n      Cæsar Rodney, a signer of the Declaration of Independence,\r\n      died this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1784.\r\n\r\nThe want of public credit was very much felt. There was no authority\r\nsufficient to raise money to meet the interest, even, on the debt; and\r\nthis produced great distress.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 1—The Continental Congress meets at Trenton, N. J.\r\n      Richard Henry Lee, of Va., is chosen President.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 4—A treaty with the Six Nations, who had sided with the\r\n      British during the war, was made at Ft. Schuyler (formerly\r\n      Ft. Stanwix—now Utica, N. Y.).\r\n\r\n      Commerce begins to revive. Reciprocity treaties were made,\r\n      and trade with eastern Asia commenced this year by a voyage\r\n      to China, from New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n1785.\r\n\r\n    Jan.—Congress adjourns to New York, where it continued to\r\n      hold its sessions for some years.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 10—Thomas Jefferson appointed to fill the place of\r\n      Franklin, as Minister to France; Franklin wishes to return\r\n      home. He had been there nine years.\r\n\r\n    July—Commercial treaties negotiated with Prussia, Denmark,\r\n      Portugal, and Tuscany.\r\n\r\n      The treaty with Prussia stipulated that, in case of war\r\n      between that country and the United States, there should be\r\n      no privateering.\r\n\r\n    ” 13—Stephen Hopkins, of R. I., a signer of the Declaration\r\n      of Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    ” 28—Wm. Whipple, of N. H., a signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    ” ”—Treaties made with the Cherokees, Choctaws, and\r\n      Chickasaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n1786.\r\n\r\nFinancial troubles were now approaching a crisis. In 1784-5 the\r\nimportations from England had amounted to $30,000,000. The exportations\r\nto only $9,000,000. Paper money was depreciated so much as to be of\r\nlittle value. Debt oppressed government and people; want of vigorous\r\nauthority was everywhere felt; and many disorders in Tennessee, Kentucky\r\nand elsewhere, begin to threaten the internal peace of the country.\r\n\r\n    June 19—Gen. Nathaniel Greene, an able commander in the\r\n      Revolutionary armies, died. He manouvered against Cornwallis\r\n      in North and South Carolina with great ability.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 5—Shay’s Rebellion broke out in Mass. That State wished\r\n      to raise money to aid Congress in paying the interest on\r\n      the federal debt. The people felt unable to pay it. They\r\n      mobbed the courts but were dispersed by troops under Gen.\r\n      Lincoln. Three were killed and one wounded, in an attack\r\n      the insurgents made on an arsenal. There was little other\r\n      fighting. Fourteen persons were tried and condemned to death\r\n      but afterwards pardoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n1787.\r\n\r\nThese and other events convinced the people that an important change in\r\nthe government was necessary. It became clear that a vigorous central\r\nauthority, alone, could answer the purpose. The States were nearly\r\nindependent of each other; but this produced conflicts and want of\r\nharmony, which nearly ruined them all.\r\n\r\nA congress of deputies to consider commercial questions, called by Va.\r\nhad, in Sept., 1786, recommended a convention to revise the Articles of\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 2—The Continental Congress assembled, electing Gen. St.\r\n      Clair, President.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—Congress approves the call for a Constitutional\r\n      Convention.\r\n\r\n    May 25—The convention assembled in Philadelphia, and elected\r\n      Gen. Geo. Washington, President.\r\n\r\n    July 11—The Continental Congress organize the Northwest\r\n      Territory—north of the Ohio river. Preparations were\r\n      immediately made for settling it.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 28—The Constitution, as signed by the members of the\r\n      convention, laid before Congress, which sends it to the State\r\n      Legislatures for approval.\r\n\r\n      Arthur Middleton of S. C., and Thomas Stone of Md., signers\r\n      of the Declaration of Independence, died, Jan. 1st and Oct.\r\n      5th, respectively.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 7—Delaware ratifies the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—Pennsylvania accepts the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1788.\r\n\r\n    July 4—The anniversary of Independence is kept with great\r\n      display, in Philadelphia, in special honor of the adoption of\r\n      the new Constitution.\r\n\r\n      By the close of July nine more States had ratified the\r\n      Constitution, and it went into operation.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 13—Congress selects the first Wednesday of Jan. (1789)\r\n      for the appointment of Presidential electors; the first\r\n      Wednesday in February for their appointment of President\r\n      and Vice-President; and March 4th (the first Wednesday that\r\n      month) for the new government to go into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n1789.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 4—Thomas Nelson, of Va., signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 13—Ethan Allen, of Revolutionary fame, died.\r\n\r\n    April 30—Washington inaugurated as first President.\r\n\r\n    May 12—A Tariff Bill for raising a revenue reported in\r\n      Congress. This became a law, and went into effect Aug. 1st,\r\n      1789.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—The Department of Foreign Affairs (afterwards called\r\n      State Department,) organized.\r\n\r\n      The Treasury Department is next established, followed by the\r\n      War Department, to which the Navy was joined for the present.\r\n\r\n      The Judiciary was then constituted. Salaries, and the rules\r\n      for parliamentary procedure were determined. The Postmaster\r\n      general had long been an officer of the government, and\r\n      required less change than most of the others. This made a\r\n      very busy session. Congress also passed a resolution to add\r\n      ten amendments to the Constitution—which were submitted to\r\n      the States and afterward ratified. Congress adjourned the\r\n      last of September.\r\n\r\n      The democratic tone of the government, and the spirit applied\r\n      to the interpretation of the Constitution by the first\r\n      Congress, has generally prevailed ever since. That tone and\r\n      spirit were truly republican.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 8—The President made a tour through New England.\r\n\r\n    ” 13—North Carolina ratified the Constitution.\r\n\r\n      Many Indian treaties were made this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1790.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 8—Congress reassembled. This session was scarcely\r\n      inferior in interest and importance to the first from the\r\n      variety of new questions required to be settled, and the more\r\n      perfect development given to former ones.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 8—Provision was made for payment of the foreign debt.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 1—An act ordering a census to be taken was passed.\r\n\r\n    ” 24—A naturalization law was originated.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 15—A patent law was constructed.\r\n\r\n    ” 30—Treason was defined and the penalty determined on.\r\n\r\n    May 29—The Constitution ratified by Rhode Island; making up\r\n      the whole number of thirteen States.\r\n\r\n    ” 31—“An act to encourage learning” secured copyrights to\r\n      authors.\r\n\r\n    July 16—Three very exciting debates that had occupied much of\r\n      the time of Congress, had a bearing on the location of the\r\n      National Capital, which was this day permanently settled.\r\n      The President was authorized to determine the site on the\r\n      Potomac, and have the buildings erected so as to be ready\r\n      for occupation in 1800. Agreeably to this act Maryland and\r\n      Virginia ceded the District of Columbia to the United States.\r\n\r\n      Gen. Putnam, a brave Revolutionary soldier, Benjamin\r\n      Franklin, of Pa., Wm. Hooper, of N. C., and Francis\r\n      Hopkinson, of N. J., all except Putnam signers of the\r\n      Declaration of Independence, died this year.\r\n\r\n      The Territory South of the Ohio was organized this year.\r\n      The financial system of the country was established, the\r\n      slavery question debated and settled in accordance with\r\n      the compromise of the Constitution, and the State debts\r\n      transferred to the United States.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 12—Congress adjourned to meet next in Philadelphia and\r\n      thereafter until 1800.\r\n\r\n    ” 13—A treaty with the Creek Indians solemnly ratified by\r\n      Washington.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 6—The Third Session of Congress commenced. The President\r\n      congratulates Congress on the improvement of the finances,\r\n      and the prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n1791.\r\n\r\n    Feb.—The United States Bank established. It was to have a\r\n      capital of $10,000,000—its charter to run twenty years.\r\n\r\n    ” 4—Kentucky voted admission into the Union in the next year\r\n      (Jan. 1st, 1792).\r\n\r\n    ” 18—Vermont having (Jan. 20th) ratified the Constitution\r\n      and asked admission into the Union, it is granted this day.\r\n      The immediate prosperity that followed the adoption of the\r\n      Constitution of 1787, the strength, vigor, and moderation\r\n      seen to be combined in its arrangement of the government, led\r\n      most of the States to remodel their State Constitutions on\r\n      it, in a short time.\r\n\r\n    July—The subscription to the stock of the National Bank is\r\n      all taken in a few hours after the books are opened.\r\n\r\n    Aug.—Great Britain first sends a minister to the United\r\n      States Government.\r\n\r\n    Sep. 17—An expedition of 2,000 troops, under Gen. St. Clair,\r\n      starts from Ft. Washington against the Indians in the\r\n      Northwest Territory.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 4—Gen. St. Clair is surprised and defeated by the\r\n      Indians. There were 600 killed—the whole loss amounted to\r\n      upward of 900. Several other smaller expeditions had been\r\n      sent against the Indians in the course of the year. One, Gen.\r\n      Harmer’s, had been defeated. Internal taxes on spirits were\r\n      first commenced this year. Benj. Harrison, of Va., a signer\r\n      of the Declaration of Independence, died this year. A voyage\r\n      around the world, by way of Oregon, China, and the Cape of\r\n      Good Hope, had opened wide fields to commerce. The first\r\n      census was now completed. The Second Congress, assembled at\r\n      Philadelphia, Oct. 24, was occupied in arranging the new\r\n      ratio of Representatives. It was a very difficult matter to\r\n      settle from the sectional struggles that entered into the\r\n      question.\r\n\r\n\r\n1792.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 16—A bounty for fishing vessels provided.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—The Post Office Department reorganized.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 2—The establishment and regulations of the U. S. Mint\r\n      are embodied in a law.\r\n\r\n    ” 14—Act apportioning Representatives passed. This gave the\r\n      next House of Representatives in Congress 105 members.\r\n\r\n    May 8—Laws organizing the Militia are passed.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 8—Henry Laurens, first President of the Continental\r\n      Congress, died. The second presidential election this\r\n      year resulted in the re-election of Washington and\r\n      Adams. Washington received all the electoral votes—the\r\n      anti-federalists opposing only Mr. Adams, whose electoral\r\n      vote was 77, the candidate of the opposition receiving 50.\r\n      Much seditious opposition was made in North Carolina and\r\n      Pennsylvania to the excise law,—the tax on spirits. The\r\n      President issued a proclamation against them, Sept. 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\n1793.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 24—The proclamation of the French Republic is greeted\r\n      in Boston with a celebration in its honor. The close and\r\n      friendly relations of the United States with France, arising\r\n      from their aid to us in the Revolutionary War, led the French\r\n      minister, Genet, to a course of conduct inconsistent with\r\n      the existence of our friendly relations with England. The\r\n      U. S. Government decided to proclaim neutrality—the people\r\n      sympathized strongly with France. Washington and his cabinet\r\n      pursued a strict neutral course, in which the people finally\r\n      acquiesced, and Genet’s recall was solicited and obtained.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 12—A Fugitive Slave law passed.\r\n\r\n    July 23—Roger Sherman, signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 8—John Hancock, of Mass., the first signer of the\r\n      Declaration of Independence, died. This year laid the\r\n      foundation of the policy of neutrality or non-interference\r\n      with the European wars, that became the settled policy of the\r\n      United States.\r\n\r\n      The year was also distinguished by the violence of party\r\n      feeling.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 2—Congress assembles at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    ” 31—Jefferson resigns his seat in the Cabinet. He was\r\n      Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n1794.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 11—An act is passed for building four ships of war,\r\n      which laid the foundation of our present navy.\r\n\r\n      Some hostile English “Orders in Council” led to arrangements\r\n      for fortifying the harbors of the country.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—The Slave trade is regulated by law, no American\r\n      vessel being allowed to supply slaves to another nation.\r\n      The importation of slaves into this country had been\r\n      allowed until the year 1808, by Art. 1st, Sec. 9th, of the\r\n      Constitution.\r\n\r\n    ” 26—As a retaliation on the British “Orders in Council” for\r\n      seizing all goods going to France in American vessels, an\r\n      embargo was laid on all shipping which was continued 60 days.\r\n      This stopped all commerce for the present.\r\n\r\n    June 5—A law relating to neutrality passed in Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—Richard Henry Lee, of Va., died; Abraham Clark, of N.\r\n      J., and John Witherspoon, of N. J., later, all signers of the\r\n      Declaration of Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    July 16—An insurrection breaks out against the excise law in\r\n      western Pennsylvania, by an armed attack on the officers of\r\n      the law. An army of 15,000 men was raised and marched into\r\n      that region, the appearance of which immediately restored\r\n      order.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 20—Gen. Wayne inflicts a thorough chastisement on the\r\n      Indians of Ohio, on the Maumee river.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 4—Congress again assembles.\r\n\r\n    ” 28—Baron Steuben, a German, who had done us great service\r\n      as an officer in the Revolutionary war, died, aged 61.\r\n\r\n\r\n1795.\r\n\r\nThis year a commercial treaty was negotiated with England, which was the\r\ncause of violent demonstrations of the two parties. Only the firmness and\r\nmoderation of Washington and his supporters saved the country from war\r\nwith that power.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 23—Gen. Sullivan died. He had been an able Maj. Gen. in\r\n      the Revolutionary war.\r\n\r\n    ” 29—A more stringent naturalization law passes.\r\n\r\n    May 19—Josiah Bartlett, of N. H., signer of the Declaration\r\n      of Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 3—A Treaty with the Northwestern Indians concluded,\r\n      which closed the Indian war.\r\n\r\n    Sept 5—A treaty is concluded with Algiers, which closed a war\r\n      with those pirates, whose attacks had been so disastrous to\r\n      our commerce.\r\n\r\n    Oct 20—A treaty of boundaries, and which opened the\r\n      Mississippi to navigation, is concluded with Spain.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 7—The fourth Congress meets.\r\n\r\n\r\n1796.\r\n\r\n    March 24—The U. S. House of Representatives require the\r\n      President to send them the papers relating to the British\r\n      treaty. The President declines, denying that they form part\r\n      of the treaty making power.\r\n\r\n    April 30—The exciting struggle on the British treaty is\r\n      closed, by a provision made by the House of Representatives\r\n      for carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\n    June 1—An act is passed admitting Tennessee into the Union.\r\n\r\n    ” 29—A new treaty is made with the Creek Indians, and the\r\n      Southern, as well as the Northern Indians, are pacified.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 19—Washington’s Farewell address is issued, to let\r\n      the people know that he would not accept office again. A\r\n      presidential election was held this autumn, in which John\r\n      Adams was elected President. Serious difficulties began to\r\n      rise with France, which took great offense at the treaty with\r\n      Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n1797.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 3—Mr. Pinckney, American Minister to France, was refused\r\n      a reception, by the French government, and obliged this day\r\n      to leave the country. Much violence was done about this time,\r\n      to American commerce, by the French.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—John Adams is inaugurated President of the United\r\n      States.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—A special session of Congress is called to consider the\r\n      threatening posture of our relations with France.\r\n\r\n    June 14—Congress imposed a fine of $10,000 and ten\r\n      years imprisonment on any American who should engage in\r\n      privateering, in any way, against a nation with whom we were\r\n      at peace.\r\n\r\n    July 3—The President transmits to Congress information of\r\n      Spanish troubles on the southern and western frontier. These\r\n      were afterwards discovered to have aimed at detaching the\r\n      Mississippi and Ohio valleys from the United States, and\r\n      erecting them into an independent power, in close alliance\r\n      with Spain.\r\n\r\n      Two new envoys are sent to France. These envoys spent many\r\n      months in Paris, treated with insolence and neglect.\r\n\r\n      In this year Francis L. Lee, of Va., Carter Braxton, of Va.,\r\n      and Oliver Wolcott, of Conn., signers of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n\r\n1798.\r\n\r\nThe French government continues to labor to draw the United States into\r\na war with them against England. Two of the three Commissioners are\r\nrequired to leave France.\r\n\r\n    April 3—The Mississippi Territory organized.\r\n\r\n    ” 14—The navy is taken from the control of the Secretary of\r\n      War, and a Navy Department with a Secretary, organized.\r\n\r\n    June 12—All commercial intercourse with France suspended.\r\n      In anticipation of war the naturalization law is amended;\r\n      an “Alien Act” passed; and the navy and army largely\r\n      strengthened.\r\n\r\n    ” 21—The President announces the failure of the Commissioners\r\n      sent to France, to make peace.\r\n\r\n    July 8—A limited naval warfare with France is authorized, and\r\n      several U. S. vessels of war go to sea.\r\n\r\n    ” 16—An additional naval armament provided for.\r\n\r\n    ” 17—Washington accepts the appointment of Commander-in-Chief\r\n      of the Army, which is being raised in expectation of war.\r\n\r\n    ”—About this time some 365 armed vessels had been\r\n      commissioned by the U. S. government, besides the regular\r\n      navy, to make war on the armed vessels of France. This\r\n      armament was, however chiefly used for defense.\r\n\r\n      Lewis Morris, of N. Y., James Wilson, of Pa., and Geo. Read,\r\n      of Del., signers of the Declaration of Independence, died\r\n      this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1799.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this year Congress provided for the raising of am\r\narmy of 40,000 men.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 18—By invitation of the French government, the President\r\n      nominates another embassy to France.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 7—The French frigate l’Insurgente captured in the West\r\n      Indies by the U. S. frigate Constellation.\r\n\r\n    April—The Legislature of New York abolishes Slavery in that\r\n      State.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 14—Gen. Washington’s death, in the 68th year of his age.\r\n\r\n      Wm. Paca, of Md., a signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died this year.\r\n\r\n      A change in the government of France, and the vigorous action\r\n      of the U. S. government in arming for war, induced the\r\n      French to retreat from their unfriendly position and offer\r\n      to arrange the difference. The refusal of our government to\r\n      entangle themselves with European politics became a settled\r\n      principle, of great value to us; though it was strongly\r\n      opposed by the Anti-Federalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 23—Edward Rutledge, of S. C., signer of Dec. of Ind.\r\n      died.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 1—The U. S. frigate Constellation beats without\r\n      capturing the French frigate La Vengeance.\r\n\r\n    April 4—General bankruptcy law passed by Congress.\r\n\r\n    May 7—The Territory of Indiana organized by act of Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 10—An act authorizing the election of a Territorial\r\n      Assembly in the Territory of Mississippi, organized some\r\n      years before, was passed.\r\n\r\n    July—The government is moved to the new capital at Washington.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 1—The envoys to France arrange a convention, or\r\n      temporary treaty, which prevents the formal outbreak of war,\r\n      though it had long continued to be waged on the sea. More\r\n      than 50 vessels had been captured from the French this year.\r\n      The gratitude of Americans to France for her aid, formerly,\r\n      made a large part of the people very unwilling to declare\r\n      war; but her arrogant demands and war on our commerce had the\r\n      good effect to separate the country from all close alliances\r\n      in Europe.\r\n\r\n    Nov.—The fourth presidential election resulted in the\r\n      defeat of the Federalist party, by the election of Thomas\r\n      Jefferson as President. Its opponent, the anti-federalist,\r\n      or Republican party, feared a strong central government; yet\r\n      when they came into power they adopted the same policy. Any\r\n      other policy would have ruined the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 16—The Convention with France, to remain in force eight\r\n      years, ratified.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 3—The Sixth Congress terminates, and with it the\r\n      administration of President Adams.\r\n\r\n    ” 4—Jefferson inaugurated President. The trial of the\r\n      Constitution was now past. It was permanently settled in the\r\n      respect of the people, and had made the country respected\r\n      by other nations. The “Sedition Laws” passed in July,\r\n      1798, became inoperative at this time, by the provision\r\n      accompanying them. They had been framed for the suppression\r\n      of dangerous political intrigues in time of war. Party spirit\r\n      was exceedingly bitter at this time, and these laws produced\r\n      much excitement, but contributed to the safety of the\r\n      government.\r\n\r\n    June 10—The Basha of Tripoli declares war on the United\r\n      States.\r\n\r\n    ” 14—Benedict Arnold died in London.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 6—The U. S. vessel of war Experiment, captures a\r\n      Tripolitan vessel in the Mediterranean sea.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 7—The Seventh Congress assembles. The reaction, at this\r\n      time, in public sentiment, produced by the French Revolution,\r\n      the excesses of which resulted in a military despotism under\r\n      Napoleon Bonaparte, infused a spirit of moderation and\r\n      caution into the politics of the United States under the new\r\n      party now in power, that was highly beneficial. Extreme views\r\n      were checked, and no serious change was made in the general\r\n      policy of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n1802.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 4—The reapportionment of Representatives in Congress\r\n      by the census of 1800, was made. No change in the number of\r\n      inhabitants to one Representative (one to every 33,000) was\r\n      introduced. The foundation of a Military Academy at West\r\n      Point, N. Y., was laid at this time.\r\n\r\n    April 14—The Naturalization Laws, made very stringent in the\r\n      last administration to correspond with a state of war, were\r\n      liberalized.\r\n\r\n    April 30—An act authorizing the formation of a State\r\n      Constitution in Ohio, preparatory to its admission into the\r\n      Union, is passed.\r\n\r\n    May 3—Washington, D. C., incorporated as a city.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 16—Commerce on the Mississippi by American citizens,\r\n      suspended by the Spanish authorities at New Orleans.\r\n\r\n      It became evident that the possession of the Mississippi\r\n      River and territory near it was of the highest importance\r\n      to the welfare of the West, and measures looking toward the\r\n      acquisition of it began to be taken.\r\n\r\n      A large reduction was made this year in the public debt, and\r\n      the policy of economy in public expenditure became a leading\r\n      feature of the administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n1803.\r\n\r\n    March 3—The anxiety of the people in regard to the navigation\r\n      of the Mississippi leads Congress to invest the President\r\n      with extraordinary authority to negotiate, or use force, in\r\n      his discretion. He was authorized to call on the States to\r\n      furnish 80,000 men, if need be.\r\n\r\n    April 30—A treaty is concluded with Napoleon Bonaparte for\r\n      the purchase of the whole of the Louisiana Territory for\r\n      $15,000,000.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 13—By a treaty with the Kaskaskia Indians a large part\r\n      of Illinois is opened to settlement.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 31—The U. S. frigate Philadelphia ran on a sunken rock\r\n      in the harbor of Tripoli, and was captured. The American\r\n      fleet had captured or destroyed several Tripolitan vessels of\r\n      war during the summer.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 20—The President takes possession of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n1804.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 2—Geo. Walton, of Geo., signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—New Jersey passes a law freeing all the slaves born in\r\n      the State after the next 4th of July.\r\n\r\n    ” 16—Lieut. Decatur, of the U. S. Navy, ran into the harbor\r\n      of Tripoli in the night and burned the Philadelphia—captured\r\n      by the Tripolitans, some time before. This done he withdrew\r\n      in safety, in the sloop he had employed for the bold\r\n      enterprise.\r\n\r\n    July 11—Alexander Hamilton, an eminent statesman, was killed\r\n      in a duel with Aaron Burr, Vice-President of the United\r\n      States. He was 48 years old and his death was considered as a\r\n      public calamity.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 3—Com. Preble attacks Tripoli, sinks two vessels,\r\n      captures three more, and bombards the city.\r\n\r\n      The city was blockaded during the remainder of the year and\r\n      through the winter.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 18—Gen. Philip Schuyler died at Albany, N. Y.\r\n\r\n      Jefferson was re-elected President in this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n1805.\r\n\r\nGreat commercial prosperity marked this period. France and England were\r\nat war and most of the carrying trade fell to American vessels. The\r\npeaceful acquisition of Louisiana, and the prosperity of the west in\r\nconsequence, contributed much to the development of the country. The\r\ngrand era of progress in the United States began to dawn, though overcast\r\nby threatening difficulties with Spain and England.\r\n\r\n    March—Chief Justice Chase having been impeached by the House\r\n      of Representatives, was acquitted by the Senate.\r\n\r\n    ” 4—Jefferson’s second inauguration as President.\r\n\r\n    June 3—A treaty of peace made with Tripoli.\r\n\r\n      A Territorial Legislature is authorized in the Territory of\r\n      Orleans, and the Territory of Louisiana organized.\r\n\r\n    June 11—The Territory of Michigan is organized. It was very\r\n      thinly settled, but separated by so great a distance from the\r\n      inhabited parts of Indiana Territory as to require a separate\r\n      government.\r\n\r\n    July 4—Large cessions of land are obtained, by treaty and\r\n      purchase, from the Indians. Most of their lands in Ohio,\r\n      Indiana, and along the Ohio River were acquired in an\r\n      equitable manner. Large cessions are obtained this year from\r\n      the Creeks and Cherokees, who received a fair equivalent.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 12—Wm. Moultrie, a distinguished Revolutionary soldier,\r\n      died.\r\n\r\n      Measures are set on foot to purchase Florida from the\r\n      Spaniards. There seemed no alternative but such a purchase\r\n      or a war. Difficulties with England began to increase.\r\n      Several American vessels with valuable cargoes are seized by\r\n      the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n1806.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 16—Two million dollars are voted that the President may\r\n      commence negotiations with Spain for Florida. The British\r\n      continue to violate our flag by impressing seamen on our\r\n      vessels.\r\n\r\n    March 26—A retaliatory law was enacted by Congress forbidding\r\n      the importation of certain English goods, to take effect in\r\n      November in order to give time for negotiation. Provision was\r\n      also made for increasing the army and navy.\r\n\r\n      The summer of this year was disturbed, in the west, by rumors\r\n      of a design to separate the Louisiana Territory and Western\r\n      States from the Union, by the establishment of an independent\r\n      government.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 10—Gen. Horatio Gates, an officer of the Revolution,\r\n      died.\r\n\r\n    Dec.—The session of Congress commencing the first of this\r\n      month was largely occupied with a law forbidding the slave\r\n      trade after 1808. There was much violent debate but the law\r\n      was enacted early in the next year.\r\n\r\n      Robt. Morris, of Pa., on the 8th of May; Geo. Wythe, of Va.,\r\n      on the 8th of June; James Smith, of Pa., on the 11th of July,\r\n      signers of the Declaration of Independence; and Gen. Henry\r\n      Knox, an officer of the Revolution, on the 25th of Oct.,\r\n      died. Gen. Knox was Secretary of War during Washington’s\r\n      administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n1807.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 10—An act for commencing the Coast Survey, and\r\n      appropriating $50,000 for that purpose, is passed.\r\n\r\n      The English had defeated and almost annihilated the French\r\n      and Spanish navies, and became very tyrannical toward neutral\r\n      nations, which begins to injure our commerce. Bonaparte\r\n      retaliates in the same spirit which doubles the difficulty.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 18—A treaty made by American ambassadors with England\r\n      was rejected by our government because the British refused\r\n      to allow that British born citizens could become American\r\n      citizens by naturalization. These the English government\r\n      claimed the right of impressing from our vessels, which we\r\n      denied.\r\n\r\n    June 22—A British ship of war, the Leopard, fires into the\r\n      American frigate Chesapeake while unprepared to resist, and\r\n      took several men from her. Three Americans were killed, and\r\n      eighteen wounded.

Preble, of the U.S. navy, died.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 15—Aaron Burr tried for treason, (he was the leader of\r\n      the conspiracy believed to have endeavored to detach the\r\n      Mississippi Valley from the Union,) was acquitted for want of\r\n      evidence, though generally believed guilty.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 26—Oliver Ellsworth, U. S. Chief Justice, died.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 17—Bonaparte’s “Milan Decree” subjects American\r\n      commercial vessels to seizure.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—This and like British “Orders in Council” caused\r\n      Congress to lay an embargo, forbidding any vessels to sail\r\n      from our ports.\r\n\r\n\r\n1808.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 1—The act of Congress, passed in the previous session,\r\n      to carry out the provision of the Constitution to abolish the\r\n      slave trade at this time, goes into effect to-day.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 17—Bonaparte orders the seizure and confiscation of all\r\n      American vessels in France, or that should afterwards arrive\r\n      there.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 7—The tenth Congress assembles again. Much discussion is\r\n      had over the embargo, but it is finally determined to make\r\n      it still more stringent and place the country in a state of\r\n      defense.\r\n\r\n    ”—A presidential election this month results in the choice\r\n      of James Madison for the next term. He was a republican, or\r\n      democrat, in politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n1809.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 9—An act is passed “more effectually to enforce the\r\n      embargo.”\r\n\r\n    Feb. 3—Illinois organized under a Territorial Government.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—The embargo is partially repealed.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 3—The Tenth Congress closes, at the same time as the\r\n      Administration of Jefferson. Madison was inaugurated the\r\n      next day. He served two terms. A war with Great Britain was\r\n      commenced in his first, and ended in his second term.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—Thos. Haywood, of S. C., signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 19—An arrangement of the difficulties with England\r\n      concluded with the British Minister, Erskine, and, in\r\n      the expectation of permanent peace, the Embargo and\r\n      Non-intercourse acts cease by proclamation of the President.\r\n\r\n    May 22—An extra session of the eleventh Congress meets.\r\n\r\n    July 20—News arrives of the rejection by the English\r\n      government of the Erskine treaty.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 9—The President forbids, by proclamation, all\r\n      intercourse with Great Britain and France.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 8—A new English minister having been sent, his arrogant\r\n      tone causes the U. S. government to decline further\r\n      intercourse with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n1810.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 23—Bonaparte orders the sale and confiscation of 132\r\n      American vessels (detained in France by previous decree) and\r\n      their cargoes, and the same confiscation is ordered of all\r\n      American vessels afterward entering French ports. The 132\r\n      vessels and their cargoes were worth $8,000,000.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 5—The French government announces the revocation of\r\n      their confiscation act, to take effect Nov. 1. A deadly\r\n      struggle had been, for many years, going on between Napoleon\r\n      Bonaparte and England. This hostility of France to American\r\n      commerce was in retaliation, of the British “Orders in\r\n      Council” against neutral commerce trading with France.\r\n      England had nearly destroyed the French navy and considered\r\n      herself mistress of the seas. She wished to reduce American\r\n      commerce to the condition of colonial times, which, with\r\n      impressment of seamen, was the cause of the present struggle.\r\n      Our commerce was constantly growing, our people spirited, and\r\n      resolved to have their rights and Flag respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n1811.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 26—An act passed establishing naval hospitals.\r\n\r\n    May 16—The American frigate President, and the British sloop\r\n      of war Little Belt, fire into each other. The Little Belt\r\n      is disabled. This was a retaliation of the firing of the\r\n      British ship Leopard on the American Chesapeake, four years\r\n      before, and also of the capture of an American merchantman\r\n      bound to France, off New York, by a British vessel about\r\n      this time. Several instances of impressment, by the British,\r\n      from American vessels, had lately occurred, and there was a\r\n      feeling of great exasperation toward England. The English\r\n      government had not yet made any atonement for the attack on\r\n      the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\n    June 1—Gen. Eaton, prominent in the war with Tripoli, died.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—Samuel Chase, Chief Justice of the U. S., died.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 2—Wm. Williams, of Conn., died. The two last were\r\n      signers of the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n      The relief of American commerce from outrages by the French\r\n      proved delusive, and many grievous wrongs are suffered this\r\n      year.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 7—Two twin brothers of the Shawanese tribe of Indians\r\n      (Tecumseh and the Prophet) had been for some years engaged in\r\n      forming a conspiracy among a large number of Indian tribes\r\n      on the Northwestern frontier to exterminate the whites. Gen.\r\n      Harrison’s army is attacked by the Indians this day, at\r\n      Tippecanoe. They are defeated by Gen. Harrison.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 2—The ratio of Representation is revised on the census\r\n      of 1800, and fixed at 35,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n1812.\r\n\r\n    Jan.—Various acts are passed for putting the army and navy in\r\n      a condition for war.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 4—An embargo is laid on American shipping, by act of\r\n      Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 8—Louisiana admitted into the Union as a State.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—Geo. Clinton, Vice-President of the United States, died.\r\n\r\n    June 4—The Territory of Missouri organized.\r\n\r\n    ” 23—The British government repeal the obnoxious “Orders\r\n      in Council,” but refuse to give up the right of search and\r\n      impressment on American vessels. The American government\r\n      refuses to be satisfied with this; besides, it had already\r\n      declared war, June 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have stated in connection with the appropriate events, the causes of\r\nthis war which had accumulated during the last five years at a rapid\r\nrate. The seizure and captures of American vessels by Great Britain\r\namounted to 917; by France to 558. Upwards of 6,000 cases of impressments\r\nwere recorded in the American Department of State; and in all these our\r\nFlag had been violated. It was estimated that about as many more had been\r\nmade, of which no official information had been received. The Americans\r\nwere averse to war and had long borne these injuries in the hope that\r\na settlement might be reached by negotiation; but they insisted on the\r\ninviolability of our Flag, and the right of naturalization. On the\r\ncommencement of hostilities 2,500 of these impressed sailors, claiming\r\nto be American citizens, refused to fight against America, and were\r\nimprisoned by the English government, where most of them were kept to the\r\nclose of the war.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 24—The English government, however, had the magnanimity,\r\n      when news arrived of the Declaration of War by the United\r\n      States, to allow all American vessels then in their ports six\r\n      weeks to dispose of their lading and to depart undisturbed.\r\n\r\n      The great success of the war on the American side was on\r\n      the sea, where it was much more seriously detrimental and\r\n      mortifying to the English than victories on the land would\r\n      have been. The land forces were generally inefficiently\r\n      conducted, though the close of the war was signalized by the\r\n      victory of Gen. Jackson, at New Orleans, which was extremely\r\n      gratifying to American pride.\r\n\r\n    July 12—Gen. Hull, with 1,800 troops, invades Canada.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 8—After various mishaps, Hull retreats to Detroit.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—Col. Miller defeats Tecumseh and a body of British troops\r\n      at Maguaga.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—Ft. Dearborn (now Chicago) was abandoned by its small\r\n      garrison, by the orders of Hull. During their retreat they\r\n      were attacked, and most of them massacred by the Indians.\r\n\r\n    ” 16—Gen. Hull surrendered Detroit and all the military\r\n      forces and stores in the territory to the British. He was\r\n      afterward sentenced to death by a court-martial, but\r\n      pardoned by the president, though degraded from all military\r\n      command.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—The U. S. frigate Constitution, Capt. Hull, does great\r\n      honor to the American arms by the capture of the English\r\n      frigate Guerriere. This vessel had challenged the American\r\n      vessels in a contemptuous way. She had 79 killed and wounded,\r\n      the Constitution only 13. There were 10 impressed American\r\n      seamen on the Guerriere.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 7—The U. S. frigate Essex captures the Alert in 8\r\n      minutes.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 13—In another invasion of Canada by Gen. Van Rensselaer,\r\n      though much gallantry was displayed, an unexpected British\r\n      reinforcement obliged the surrender of 700 men after 160 had\r\n      been killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n    ” 18—The U. S. sloop of war Wasp captures the British sloop\r\n      of war Frolic, which was the strongest vessel. The Frolic had\r\n      100 killed and wounded, the Wasp but 10. Both were captured\r\n      by a British 74 pounder the same day.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Capt. Decatur, of the frigate United States, captures\r\n      the Macedonian, a British frigate. British loss 104, American\r\n      only 7.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 22—The U. S. brig Vixen is captured by the English\r\n      frigate Southampton. Both were afterward shipwrecked.\r\n\r\n      A presidential election in this month secured the re-election\r\n      of Madison.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 29—The U. S. frigate Constitution, Commodore Bainbridge,\r\n      captures the British frigate Java, off the coast of Brazil.\r\n      American loss 44, British 151. These naval victories with\r\n      so little loss produced much exultation in America, and\r\n      much surprise and mortification in England. The Americans\r\n      were able seamen, and had long burned to avenge the insults\r\n      and contempt of the English navy. Americans are capable of\r\n      extraordinary vigor when thoroughly aroused. The operations\r\n      on land had been much interfered with by the strenuous and\r\n      almost treasonable opposition of the anti-war party, and\r\n      this continued to be an embarrassment during nearly its\r\n      whole course. The general disfavor with which this violent\r\n      opposition was regarded, however, and the sympathy felt for\r\n      the President, so embarrassed, procured his re-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n1813.\r\n\r\nMilitary operations this year were, in part, more creditable and\r\nencouraging. The regular force amounted to about 55,000 men; an act had\r\nbeen passed authorizing the construction of four 74 gun ships, and six\r\nforty-fours; and for an increase of the navy on the lakes.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 22—A disastrous enterprise at Frenchtown (now Monroe,\r\n      Mich.) results in the loss of nearly 900 American troops\r\n      under Winchester. The wounded were left by Gen. Proctor, the\r\n      British commander, to be massacred by the Indians.\r\n\r\n    ” 23—Geo. Clymer, of Pa., signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    ” 26—An act of Congress authorizes the President to borrow\r\n      $16,000,000.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—He is authorized to issue Treasury notes to the amount\r\n      of $5,000,000.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 24—The Hornet captures the British brig Peacock, on the\r\n      coast of South America.\r\n\r\n      The Delaware and Chesapeake bays are blockaded by the British\r\n      about this time.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—Madison is inaugurated for his second term.\r\n\r\n    ” 8—The emperor of Russia having offered his services as\r\n      mediator between the United States and England, the President\r\n      appoints commissioners to treat for peace.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 10—The British attack Lewiston, Del., but are repulsed\r\n      after having bombarded it several days.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—Americans under Gen. Pike, capture York, Upper Canada,\r\n      with a large quantity of stores. Gen. Pike is killed.\r\n\r\n    May 1—The British Gen. Proctor besieges Gen. Harrison in Fort\r\n      Meigs.\r\n\r\n    ” 5—Gen. Clay coming to his assistance Proctor retreats. Col.\r\n      Dudley, making a sortie from Ft. Meigs, is drawn into an\r\n      ambuscade and loses 650 men. He is himself mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n      The British Admiral Cockburn barbarously ravages the shores\r\n      of Chesapeake bay.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—Ft. George, at Niagara, surrenders to the Americans, and\r\n      Sir Geo. Prevost is repulsed from Sacketts Harbor, N. Y., by\r\n      Gen. Brown.\r\n\r\n    June 1—The U. S. frigate Chesapeake captured by the British\r\n      frigate Shannon. American loss 133; British loss about half\r\n      as many. Capt. Lawrence of the Chesapeake is mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n    ” 6—Gens. Chandler and Winder surprised in the night by the\r\n      enemy they were going to attack. The two generals are taken\r\n      prisoners, but their troops repulse the enemy and retire.\r\n\r\n    ” 23—Col. Boerstler, in command of an American force of 600\r\n      men, is surrounded by a superior force at Beaver Dams and\r\n      compelled to surrender.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Admiral Cockburn, failing in his attack on the American\r\n      forces at Craney Island, Va., lands at Hampton and commits\r\n      many outrages.\r\n\r\n    July 31—American Com. Chauncy lands at York, U. C., captures\r\n      and destroys stores, and the British do the same at\r\n      Plattsburg, on lake Champlain.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 2—Gen. Proctor with 1,000 British and Indians attacks\r\n      Col. Croghan with 160 men, at Ft. Stephenson, Lower Sandusky,\r\n      O., and is repulsed with a loss of 150.\r\n\r\n      About this time the American frigate Essex, Capt. Porter,\r\n      cruising in the Pacific ocean, captured 12 armed British\r\n      whalers.\r\n\r\n    ” 13—The American sloop-of-war Argus, cruising in the English\r\n      Channel, captured 21 British merchantmen, but was herself\r\n      captured by the Pelican after a severe engagement.\r\n\r\n    ” 30—Tecumseh had stirred up the Creek Indians to war, and\r\n      they attacked Ft. Mims, which they set on fire and captured,\r\n      massacring all but 20 out of 400 men, women and children.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 3—The American brig Enterprise captures the Boxer on\r\n      the coast of Maine.\r\n\r\n    ” 10—Perry’s victory on Lake Erie. He captures the whole\r\n      fleet (6 vessels) of the enemy. His laconic dispatch to Gen.\r\n      Harrison was, “We have met the enemy, and they are ours.”\r\n\r\n    Oct. 5—Battle of the Thames (Upper Canada). Gen. Harrison,\r\n      commanding the Americans, defeated the British and Indians,\r\n      under Gen. Proctor and Tecumseh. The latter was slain. The\r\n      British lost about 600 in killed, wounded and prisoners; the\r\n      Americans 17 killed and 30 wounded.\r\n\r\n    ” ”—Commodore Chauncy captures 5 British vessels on Lake\r\n      Ontario.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 2—Gen. Coffee attacks the Creek Indians at\r\n      Tallushatches, Ala. 200 warriors are killed.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—Gen. Jackson defeats the Indians at Talladega, Ala.,\r\n      killing 290 of them. Two other battles with the Indians\r\n      occurred this month, and one in Dec. in which they were\r\n      defeated with great slaughter, and little loss to the\r\n      Americans. Yet so spirited and resolute were they as to\r\n      require to be almost exterminated before they would make\r\n      peace.\r\n\r\n    ” 11—1,200 Americans, under Gen. Boyd, engage 2,000 British,\r\n      under Lt. Col. Morrison, and are repulsed with a loss of 339.\r\n      British loss 180.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 10—Ft. George, at Niagara, evacuated and the town of\r\n      Newark burned by the Americans.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—Ft. Niagara is taken by the British and Indians who\r\n      massacre the garrison. Youngstown, Lewistown, the Tuscarora\r\n      Indian village, and Manchester, all in N. Y., are burned, in\r\n      retaliation of the destruction of Newark.\r\n\r\n    ” 30—The British burn Black Rock, Buffalo, three vessels\r\n      of Perry’s fleet, and large quantities of provisions. Gen.\r\n      Proctor justifies it as a proper retaliation. The burning of\r\n      Newark was barbarous, but was avenged tenfold. Naturalized\r\n      Irishmen, taken by the British in our armies this year,\r\n      were sent to England to be tried for treason. An equal\r\n      number of English officers were imprisoned by the American\r\n      government and notice given to the governor of Canada that\r\n      they should receive the same treatment and fate as our Irish\r\n      soldiers. This had its effect, and the latter remained simply\r\n      prisoners of war. This claim, and corresponding action on\r\n      the part of the English government, which was one of the\r\n      principal causes of the war, was, from this time, practically\r\n      relinquished. In December an embargo was laid by Congress\r\n      on American goods and provisions, to prevent their being\r\n      employed to supply the British blockading force and armies.\r\n      It produced great discontent in New England, where a large\r\n      part of the people were dependent on commerce, and were\r\n      thrown into great distress. There was much factious, and even\r\n      seditious, opposition to the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n1814.\r\n\r\nThe army operations had been unsuccessful in Canada during the last\r\nof the campaign, owing, it was thought, to the inefficiency of the\r\ncommanders, and perhaps partly to the want of experience of their\r\nsubalterns. Changes, that were proved much for the better, were made,\r\nand the campaign of this year, in this quarter, showed a more honorable\r\nrecord. Since the commencement of the war till this year, the English\r\ngovernment had been carrying on an immense European war, which was\r\nclosed by the abdication of Bonaparte and his banishment to the island\r\nof Elba. They prepared for a more vigorous effort in America, by sending\r\nconsiderable armies of the veterans of Wellington, who had conquered in\r\nEurope. They had received, the impression that the opposition to the war\r\nand the republican party, would coöperate with them, and that they might\r\nre-establish their dominion over their former colonies.\r\n\r\nBut they did not comprehend American character. Party politics have\r\nalways been conducted in a bitter and hostile spirit, but that hostility\r\nhas not been directed against their _institutions_. Extreme attachment\r\nto these, and jealous care to preserve all rights guaranteed by the\r\nConstitution, has always led the opposition to a close and sharp\r\ncriticism of all measures of the party in power differing from their\r\nown interpretation of Constitutional rights. When these institutions\r\nare really in danger all parties unite in a defense, the obstinacy and\r\nvigor of which carries everything before it. It stops at no obstacles,\r\nhesitates before no sacrifices, and counts no odds. This became apparent\r\nto the British during the summer, dispelled forever their dream of\r\nconquest, and led to a peace at the close of the campaign. The British\r\nsent 14,000 troops to Canada this spring, which was supported, in July\r\nand August, by a large reinforcement. A strong naval force, with a large\r\nbody of troops, was sent to invade the heart of the country and capture\r\nWashington. After failing in maintaining their ground here, they were\r\ndirected against the gulf coast and the Mississippi river, ending in\r\ntheir decisive defeat by Gen. Jackson, at New Orleans, Jan. 8th, 1815,\r\nnine days before the treaty of peace, signed at Ghent, in Belgium, Dec.\r\n24, was known in America.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 24—A loan of $25,000,000 authorized by Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—Gen. Jackson’s defeat of the Indians at Great Horseshoe\r\n      Bend, Ala. This battle accomplished the subjection of the\r\n      Creek Indians. Jackson had fought them on the 21st, 24th\r\n      and 27th of Jan., when they came near defeating him, but\r\n      notwithstanding their fierce and obstinate bravery, he\r\n      conquered each time, and finally, nearly exterminated them.\r\n\r\n    ” 28—The brilliant career of the U. S. frigate Essex, in the\r\n      Pacific ocean, is terminated by its capture, at Valparaiso,\r\n      Chili, by the British frigate Phebe and another sloop of war.\r\n\r\n    ” 30—Gen. Wilkinson is repulsed in an advance into Canada,\r\n      at La Colle, and is afterwards tried by court martial. Gen.\r\n      Brown is given the command of the Niagara frontier, and Gen.\r\n      Izard of northern N. Y.\r\n\r\n    April 21—The U. S. sloop of war Frolic captured by the\r\n      British frigate Orpheus.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—The U. S. sloop of war Peacock captures the British\r\n      brig-of-war Epervier with $118,000 specie on board.\r\n\r\n    May 7—A British force captures and destroys the American fort\r\n      at Oswego, N. Y., and carries off several guns.\r\n\r\n    ” 29—The Americans capture a British force at Sandy Creek, N.\r\n      Y.\r\n\r\n    June 9—The U. S. sloop of war Rattlesnake captured by a\r\n      British 50 gun ship.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—The U. S. sloop Syren captured by a British 74.\r\n\r\n    ” 28—The U. S. sloop of war Wasp captures the British sloop\r\n      of war Reindeer, in the British Channel.\r\n\r\n    July 3—Gen. Brown captures Ft. Erie, near Niagara, U. C.\r\n\r\n    ” 5—Battle of Chippewa, Canada. Gens. Brown, Scott, and\r\n      Ripley, with about 3,000 men, were opposed by the British\r\n      Gen. Riall with an equal number of the veterans of Waterloo.\r\n      Gen. Scott attacked them with such prudence and valor as to\r\n      conquer a largely superior force before Gen. Ripley could\r\n      come up to his aid. It was a splendid test of American\r\n      mettle. Loss of the British 514, of Scott 328. The British\r\n      fall back to Ft. George.\r\n\r\n    ” 11—The British make a descent on the coast of Maine.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Gen. Scott engages a British force of seven times his\r\n      number, and holds his ground for some hours when Gen. Ripley\r\n      comes to his aid, and they drive the British from the field;\r\n      but having only 1,600 men left, while the British have 5,000,\r\n      they retire next day. The British lost 878, the Americans 860.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 4—Americans besieged in Ft. Erie.\r\n\r\n    ” 8—First meeting of the U. S. and English commissioners to\r\n      treat for peace, who arranged the terms at the close of this\r\n      year. The English were very high in their demands till the\r\n      failure of their much vaunted veteran troops.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—The British make an unsuccessful attack on Stonington,\r\n      Conn. A treaty is made with the Creek Indians.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—The British repulsed from Ft. Erie with the loss of 962\r\n      men. The Americans lost 84.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—A British force landed from the fleet in the Chesapeake,\r\n      marches on Washington.\r\n\r\n    ” 24—The battle of Bladensburg, near Washington. The\r\n      Americans, much inferior in numbers, were defeated. The\r\n      British, under Gen. Ross, entered Washington the same day.\r\n      They destroyed much private property, as well as public\r\n      stores, buildings and documents.\r\n\r\n      Not deeming it prudent to remain, the British retreated from\r\n      Washington to their vessels, leaving the people greatly\r\n      exasperated at conduct unworthy of the army of a civilized\r\n      nation.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—Alexandria, Va., delivers up the public stores and\r\n      shipping there and much merchandise as a ransom from plunder\r\n      and burning.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 1—The U. S. sloop of war Wasp captures the British\r\n      sloop Avon. After taking three other prizes in European\r\n      waters, she disappeared and was never again heard of—supposed\r\n      to have foundered at sea. The British Gen. Prevost advances\r\n      toward Plattsburg, N. Y., with 12,000 veteran troops.\r\n\r\n    ” 11—The battle of Plattsburg. Com. McDonough, American, with\r\n      4 vessels, 10 gun boats and 850 men, captures the British\r\n      Com. Downie’s fleet of 4 vessels, 12 gun boats and 1,000 men.\r\n      A simultaneous attack by Prevost on Plattsburg miscarried\r\n      by the failure of the fleet and panic of the soldiers. They\r\n      return, in disorder, to Canada.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—The British who had captured Washington, appear near\r\n      Baltimore and land a force which repulses the Baltimore\r\n      militia, and, next day advances toward the city; but the\r\n      attack seems so formidable to them that they retreat in the\r\n      night to their vessels and depart. The British admiral could\r\n      not reduce Ft. M’Henry so as to co-operate in an attack on\r\n      the city by water. The patriotic song, “The Star Spangled\r\n      Banner,” was written during this bombardment of Fort M’Henry.\r\n      Gen. Ross, the British commander, was killed soon after the\r\n      landing of the troops.\r\n\r\n      About this time various attacks are made at different places\r\n      on the coast of New England, and the British pretend, by\r\n      proclamation, to take possession of all of Maine east of the\r\n      Penobscot river and annex it to New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n    ” 17—A sortie is made from Ft. Erie and the works of the\r\n      enemy surprised and taken with a loss to him of 1,000 men in\r\n      killed, wounded and prisoners.\r\n\r\n      Thus, in the midst of ravages and alarms on the coast, the\r\n      destruction of our commerce, the stagnation of business,\r\n      the financial difficulties of the government that almost\r\n      amounted to bankruptcy, and the complaints of the peace\r\n      party, (which produced much alarm by the calling of a\r\n      convention of the New England States, in December of this\r\n      year, at Hartford, Conn.,) the honor of the United States\r\n      was preserved. The formidable armies in Canada had been\r\n      baffled and defeated, the capture of Washington followed\r\n      immediately by the withdrawal of the invaders, and a strong\r\n      point made which had its effect in substantially gaining the\r\n      cause that had brought on the war, for the Americans, in the\r\n      treaty negotiations in progress. The British now turned their\r\n      attention to the Mississippi river and the coast of the gulf\r\n      of Mexico.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 7—Gen. Jackson takes Pensacola from the British, who\r\n      were laboring to raise the Indians to war again.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 15—A British fleet captures the flotilla on Lake Borgne,\r\n      La.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—12,000 British troops land below New Orleans, and\r\n      repulse the Americans.\r\n\r\n    ” 24—The treaty of peace is signed at Ghent, but is not known\r\n      in America until Feb. following.\r\n\r\n\r\n1815.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 8—Gen. Jackson, with only 6,000 men, had intrenched\r\n      himself in front of the British, who now made an assault on\r\n      his position. They were repulsed with great slaughter, losing\r\n      their general, Packingham, and near 2,000 men. Jackson lost\r\n      but 7 killed and 6 wounded. The British retreated to their\r\n      vessels.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—The U. S. frigate President captured by four English\r\n      vessels.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 18—Ft. Bowyer, near Pensacola, Fla., invested by the\r\n      British fleet. It surrenders on the 21st.\r\n\r\n    ” 17—The treaty of peace which arrived at New York on the\r\n      11th by the British sloop of war Favorite, ratified by the\r\n      American government and Peace proclaimed.\r\n\r\n    ” 24—Congress authorizes the loan of $18,400,000, and the\r\n      issue of treasury notes to the amount of $25,000,000.\r\n\r\n    ” 28—The naval war was continued some time longer. The U.\r\n      S. frigate Constitution captures two British vessels of\r\n      war, the frigate Cyane and the sloop Levant, off the island\r\n      of Madeira. In March the U. S. frigate Hornet captured the\r\n      British brig Penguin, on the coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\n      The British government, elated by their triumph over\r\n      Bonaparte, their large army accustomed to conquer in Europe,\r\n      and the fleets set free from the blockade of the Continent,\r\n      thought to make an easy conquest of America. But all their\r\n      attempts were defeated. Had peace been made a little later\r\n      the Americans might have obtained much better terms.\r\n\r\n      This war had been waged under many difficulties by the\r\n      American administration. The country and its institutions,\r\n      were new, and there was no such reserved fund of wealth and\r\n      credit, as is always found in an old and well organized\r\n      state. They depended largely on commerce, which was almost\r\n      destroyed by the great naval force of Great Britain, and the\r\n      embargo policy. Our navy was gallant and successful; but the\r\n      government lacked the means, and the unanimous support of the\r\n      people, requisite to increase it to the necessary strength.\r\n      The administration did not act with the vigor and efficiency\r\n      calculated to bring all sections and classes to its support,\r\n      and the people had not yet the experience and knowledge of\r\n      the value and strength of their own institutions needful to\r\n      inspire confidence, so that they were critical and difficult\r\n      to please, and this spirit impaired the efficiency of nearly\r\n      all government measures. What they undertook could be only\r\n      imperfectly done. The old soldiers of the Revolution were\r\n      dead or unfit by age for good service, and time was necessary\r\n      to train others and ascertain who had the necessary military\r\n      capacity for conducting operations with success. Yet, under\r\n      all these great difficulties, the United States came out of\r\n      the war with the respect of the world, such as it had never\r\n      before enjoyed. It became formidable to Europe as a great and\r\n      vigorous power with which it was not safe to trifle.\r\n\r\n      This was still more clear when the government declared war on\r\n      the Dey of Algiers, one of the pirate princes of the North\r\n      of Africa, which, for hundreds of years, had made war on the\r\n      commerce of all nations almost with impunity. Having violated\r\n      their treaty with us, the President sent out an adequate\r\n      naval force\r\n\r\n    June 17-19—which captured two Algerine vessels of war, and\r\n      threatened Algiers. The Dey, intimidated, immediately made\r\n      peace, giving liberty to all prisoners without ransom, and\r\n      full satisfaction for the injuries done to our commerce. No\r\n      European nation had before so humbled these pirates, and it\r\n      at once raised the credit of our government, and gained us\r\n      respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n    June 30—The last hostile act at sea took place in the Straits\r\n      of Sunda, in the East Indies, where the U. S. brig of war\r\n      Peacock captured the Nautilus, a British sloop of war. Thus\r\n      the three American vessels at sea when the war closed, each\r\n      came home crowned with laurels. The British vessels captured\r\n      during the war numbered 1,750—the American 1,683. The spirit\r\n      and energy of the Americans, under all their embarrassments,\r\n      gave an unmistakable indication of the future greatness and\r\n      power of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n1816.\r\n\r\nThe last two years’ experience had taught the government and the people\r\nmany important lessons by which they hastened to profit. The coast was\r\nfortified, the navy increased, manufactures and commerce encouraged, and\r\nthe best measures that the wisdom of the times could suggest, employed\r\nto restore the finances. The violently factious opposition of parties\r\nwas much moderated by the confidence gained to our government and\r\ninstitutions, and the evident folly of excessive fears. The Second U.S.\r\nBank was chartered for 20 years, with a capital of $35,000,000.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 5—Governeur Morris, an eminent and excellent American\r\n      statesman died.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 11—Indiana admitted into the Union as a State. James\r\n      Monroe was, this autumn, elected President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE U. S. FROM 1817 TO 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONROE’S ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\nA new era for America commenced with this administration, or rather,\r\nreached its period of uninterrupted development; for the whole past\r\nhistory of the country had been a preparation for it, but especially so\r\nthe late war and its results. The failure of the French revolution, and,\r\nfinally, the failure of Napoleon Bonaparte and the re-establishment of\r\nthe old monarchy in France, as a result of the excesses, first of the\r\nFrench republic, and then of the military interference of Bonaparte with\r\nthe existing state of things in Europe, had an important influence in\r\nmodifying the politics of the republican party in the United States; so\r\nthat they came partially in Jefferson’s administration, and completely by\r\nthe close of Madison’s, to follow the wise and vigorous policy pursued\r\nby Washington and the federal party; while the general government and\r\nthe institutions of the country became deeply imbued with the regard to\r\npopular rights, and attention to the interests and will of the people\r\nthat formed the leading idea of Jefferson and the original democrat,\r\nor, as it was then called, the republican party. Thus the two points of\r\nsupreme importance, vigor in the general government, and security to the\r\npeople, were happily mingled and wrought into the spirit and form of our\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe leading events of Monroe’s two administrations were the attention\r\ngiven to internal improvements—among which may be mentioned the Erie\r\ncanal in New York, and the encouragements to manufactures—the acquisition\r\nof Florida from Spain, and a definite settlement of the slavery question\r\n(for the next thirty years only, as it proved,) by the Missouri\r\ncompromise. The people now began to feel and act together, as a single\r\nnation, and material progress was rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n1817.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 3—The observance of the neutrality laws strictly\r\n      enjoined on citizens of the United States by Congress.\r\n\r\n    ” 4—James Monroe, the fifth President, inaugurated. With his\r\n      administration commences “the era of good feeling,” as it was\r\n      called. The bitterness of party controversy ceased.\r\n\r\n    June 24—Thos. McKean, of Del., signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    Dec.—Mississippi admitted into the Union, and Alabama erected\r\n      into a territory.\r\n\r\n    ”—A war broke out with the Seminole Indians, on the borders\r\n      of Florida. It came near involving us in a war with Spain.\r\n      Internal taxes are abolished by Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n1818.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 18—A law enacted giving pensions to indigent officers\r\n      and soldiers.\r\n\r\n    April 4—The Flag of the U. S. rearranged; the stripes to\r\n      represent the thirteen original States, the stars the present\r\n      number of States.\r\n\r\n    ” 18—Illinois is authorized to form a state constitution.\r\n\r\n    May 24—Gen. Jackson took Pensacola, Fla., from the Spaniards\r\n      on account of the support given by them to the Indians.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 20—A treaty of commerce and for settling boundaries is\r\n      made with England.\r\n\r\n\r\n1819.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 23—A treaty for the session of Florida ratified by\r\n      Congress, but not by the king of Spain until Oct. 20th, 1820.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 2—Arkansas organized into a territory.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 14—Alabama admitted into the Union.\r\n\r\n      In this year commenced the discussion on the balance between\r\n      the north and the south in relation to slavery. Missouri\r\n      and Maine both desire admission as States. The discussion\r\n      resulted in a settlement of the whole question Feb. 27th,\r\n      1821, by the application of the “Missouri Compromise” to the\r\n      admission of that State.\r\n\r\n\r\n1820.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 15—Wm. Ellery, of R. I., signer of the Declaration of\r\n      Independence, died.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 15—Maine admitted into the Union.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 23—Com. Perry, the hero of Lake Erie, died in the West\r\n      Indies.\r\n\r\n      The 4th census was taken in this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1821.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—James Monroe inaugurated on his second term.\r\n\r\n    ” 22—Com. Decatur died at Washington.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 22—Gen. Jackson takes possession of Florida as its\r\n      Governor. The U. S. government paid $5,000,000 for Florida.\r\n      The Spanish officers were reluctant and dilatory in giving\r\n      up their places, and Gen. Jackson had occasion for his\r\n      remarkably decisive action in dealing with them. The\r\n      governor, Don Cavalla, refusing to give up certain papers\r\n      according to the treaty, he sent him to prison until all the\r\n      papers were produced, and banished six other Spanish officers\r\n      who interfered with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n1822.\r\n\r\n    June—A commercial treaty is negotiated with France. Capt.\r\n      Allen, of the U. S. schooner Alligator, engages a band of\r\n      pirates in the West Indies, captures one of their schooners,\r\n      and recaptures five American vessels. Capt. Allen is killed.\r\n\r\n      The ports of the West India islands are opened to American\r\n      commerce by the English government.\r\n\r\n      Com. Truxton, a meritorious naval officer—Gen. Stark, the\r\n      hero of Bennington, Vt.,—and Wm. Lowndes, a statesman of S.\r\n      C., died this year.\r\n\r\n      A new arrangement of the ratio of Representation gives one\r\n      member of Congress to 40,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n1823.\r\n\r\nCom. Porter makes a successful expedition against the West Indian pirates.\r\n\r\nThis year our government acknowledged the independence of the South\r\nAmerican Republics, and ministers were appointed to Mexico, Columbia,\r\nBuenos Ayres, and Chili.\r\n\r\nA treaty for the mutual suppression of the slave trade was made by Great\r\nBritain and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n1824.\r\n\r\n    April—American and Russian commissioners settle the\r\n      boundaries between the two countries.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 15—Lafayette arrives from France. He was everywhere\r\n      received as the guest of the people with the utmost affection\r\n      and reverence. He spent a year visiting all parts of the\r\n      Union.\r\n\r\n      A presidential election this autumn does not result in a\r\n      choice, and the House of Representatives made selection\r\n      of John Quincy Adams, from the candidates, according to a\r\n      provision of the Constitution, anticipating such a case. A\r\n      protective tariff was made this year to encourage cotton\r\n      manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1825.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—J. Q. Adams inaugurated sixth President.\r\n\r\n    ” ”—An act of Congress establishes a navy yard at Pensacola,\r\n      Fla.\r\n\r\n    June 11—Dan. D. Tompkins, Vice-President with Monroe, died.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 10—Com. McDonough, the hero of Lake Champlain, died.\r\n\r\n\r\n1826.\r\n\r\n    July 4—John Adams and Thos. Jefferson, whose lives were\r\n      identified with the foundation and development of our\r\n      institutions, simultaneously died on this day.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 11—Wm. Morgan, an anti-mason, mysteriously disappears,\r\n      and is never again heard of.\r\n\r\n\r\n1827.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Mason party is formed, opposing secret societies. Much “political\r\ncapital” is made of it.\r\n\r\n    Jan.—The first considerable railroad was begun, and completed\r\n      in May. It was nine miles long, a beginning of the wonderful\r\n      transformation that was to be produced by this agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n1828.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 11—De Witt Clinton, governor of N. Y. and originator of\r\n      the Erie canal, died.\r\n\r\n      The tariff was amended and enlarged this year. This tariff\r\n      was violently opposed in the South and produced the\r\n      “Nullification Ordinances” of S. C., some time later.\r\n\r\n      In the fall of this year Gen. Andrew Jackson was elected\r\n      President.\r\n\r\n\r\n1829.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 29—The Virginia Legislature passes a resolution denying\r\n      the right of Congress to pass a protective tariff law.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—Andrew Jackson inaugurated as President.\r\n\r\n      Dan. Webster makes his great speech against nullification.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON’S ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1829.\r\n\r\n    May 19—A treaty of friendship and commerce concluded with\r\n      Brazil.\r\n\r\n    ” ”—John Jay, ex-President of the Continental Congress, Chief\r\n      Justice of the U. S., Governor of N. Y., etc., died. In\r\n      purity of patriotism, moderation, and soundness of judgment,\r\n      he came nearer to Washington than any of his contemporaries.\r\n      He was above the reach of the violent party spirit that\r\n      prevailed after Washington’s retirement from public life.\r\n\r\n\r\n1830.\r\n\r\n    May 7—A treaty made with Turkey gives U. S. commerce the\r\n      freedom of the Black sea. The vigorous dealing of our\r\n      government with the Barbary States secured the respect and\r\n      friendship of Turkey.\r\n\r\n      The important movement and interests of this year were\r\n      connected with the progress of railroads (the first American\r\n      built locomotive was made this year,) and the rapid rise\r\n      of that great interest, and with the agitation produced\r\n      by the nullification proceedings of South Carolina. That\r\n      State claimed the right to pronounce upon, and disregard\r\n      the enactments of Congress. This was subversive of the\r\n      Constitution. It drew the “Key Stone” from the arch, and the\r\n      whole structure of the Union would have fallen. No decisive\r\n      action was reached till the year 1832.\r\n\r\n    May 29—The office of Solicitor of the Treasury created.\r\n\r\n\r\n1831.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 10—The King of the Netherlands, being accepted as\r\n      arbitrator of the northern boundary between the United\r\n      States and the British Possessions, by the two governments,\r\n      decides the question in our favor.\r\n\r\n    July 4—James Monroe, ex-President of the U. S., died, aged 73.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 1—A free trade convention meets at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    ” 26—A tariff convention meets at New York. There were over\r\n      500 delegates. It was the absorbing political topic of the\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n\r\n1832.\r\n\r\n    April 1—The Black Hawk war breaks out by the attack of the\r\n      Winnebagoes, Sacs, and Foxes from the west bank of the\r\n      Mississippi on the settlers in Illinois, under the Indian\r\n      chief, Black Hawk.\r\n\r\n    ” 2—The Creek Indians sell all their lands east of the\r\n      Mississippi river to the U. S.\r\n\r\n    May 5—A commercial and boundary treaty concluded with Mexico.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—A new ratio of representation based on the 5th census\r\n      gives one member of Congress to 47,700 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n    June 1—Gen. Sumter, a South Carolina hero of the Revolution,\r\n      died.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—The cholera breaks out at Quebec, Lower Canada. It swept\r\n      over the country, following the lakes and rivers and routes\r\n      of travel, with fearful violence.\r\n\r\n    July—The cholera breaks up Gen. Scott’s army, on the way to\r\n      meet Black Hawk while in vessels on the lakes.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—Congress creates the office of Commissioner of Indian\r\n      affairs.\r\n\r\n    ” 10—Naval hospitals established at Charlestown, Mass.,\r\n      Brooklyn, N. Y., and Pensacola, Fla.\r\n\r\n    ” ”—The President vetoes the bill rechartering the U. S. Bank.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 27—Gen. Atkinson defeats the Indians and takes Black\r\n      Hawk prisoner.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 14—Chas. Carroll, of Carrollton, Md., last surviving\r\n      signer of Dec. of Ind., dies.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—An anti-tariff convention in S. C. issues the famous\r\n      “Nullification Ordinance.”\r\n\r\n    ” 24—The Unionists of S. C. meet and protest against this\r\n      ordinance.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 10—President Jackson issues a proclamation against\r\n      the nullifiers. He followed word with deed, garrisoning\r\n      the forts, and sending vessels of war into the harbor of\r\n      Charleston. His well known vigor left the nullifiers no hope\r\n      of success, and they finally submitted.\r\n\r\n    ” 18—A commercial treaty concluded with Russia.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—Gov. Hayne, of S. C., defies the President in a counter\r\n      proclamation.\r\n\r\n    ” 28—J. C. Calhoun, of S. C., the Vice-President, resigns\r\n      his office. President Jackson is reëlected this fall. His\r\n      anti-nullification measures made him very popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n1833.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 12—Henry Clay introduces a bill on the tariff\r\n      compromising the points at issue between the manufacturing\r\n      States and the South.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 3—It becomes a law, and gives general satisfaction.\r\n\r\n    ” 4—President Jackson reinaugurated on his second term.\r\n\r\n    May 20—The death of La Fayette, in France.\r\n\r\n    June 1—Oliver Wolcott, Sec. of the Treasury under Washington,\r\n      dies.\r\n\r\n    July 27—Com. Bainbridge, a famous naval commander, dies.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 30—President Jackson removes his Sec. of Treas. W. J.\r\n      Duane, for refusing to carry out his policy in regard to\r\n      the U. S. Bank. The presence of the Indians in Mississippi,\r\n      Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, produces so much conflict and\r\n      so frequent a necessity for chastising them that they are\r\n      in danger of total extermination. Gen. Jackson persuades\r\n      Congress and the Indians to arrange for their removal to\r\n      lands west of the Mississippi. Some of the Indians quietly\r\n      remove this year. Many resist, but all are finally persuaded\r\n      to this course by Gen. Scott and others, except the Seminoles\r\n      of Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\n1834.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 28—Congress formally censures the President for his\r\n      course in regard to the U. S.

It was a fertile region, with a fine climate.\r\nThe Spanish possessors of Mexico, in the bigoted and bitter spirit that\r\nwas traditional with the Spaniards toward protestants, and deeply hostile\r\nin feeling from the rather high-handed and vigorous proceedings of Gen.\r\nJackson before and after the cession of Florida, did not encourage the\r\nsettlement of Texas; preferring to be separated by a wilderness from the\r\nUnited States. In 1821 the Mexicans finally threw off the Spanish yoke\r\nand established an independent government.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Americans, and especially those of the South,\r\nforeseeing the probable spread of the northern part of the Republic\r\nto the Pacific, began to look with covetous eyes on the fine Savannas\r\nof Texas, as an excellent field for land speculations, and also for\r\nextending the Southern area, so as to keep its balance in the number of\r\nslave States equal to the free States of the North, as they had been\r\nprovided for by the Missouri Compromise. It was believed to be the plan\r\nof Mr. Calhoun, an able and far-seeing statesman, thoroughly in earnest\r\nin the maintenance of slavery, and the political equality of the slave\r\nwith the free States. A settlement was made by people from the United\r\nStates. In a few years they grew to be numerous, and came in conflict\r\nwith the rigid Spanish Catholic laws, still maintained by the Mexicans.\r\nThe United States government made advances toward purchasing Texas, but\r\nthe Mexicans were resolute in their purpose to hold it, and bring its\r\npeople under the dominion of strict Mexican law. The Americans resisted\r\nthis with the settled determination of ultimate separation from Mexico,\r\nand probable annexation to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans undertook to reduce them to submission. The Texans,\r\nsupported by bold and fearless adventurers from the Southern States,\r\nresisted. The war commenced Oct. 2d, 1835, by a battle at Gonzalez,\r\nfollowed by various others. March 2d, 1836, the Texans formally declared\r\nIndependence, which they maintained by force of arms. March 3d, 1837,\r\nthe United States government recognized the Independence of Texas.\r\nEngland did the same in 1842. Propositions of annexation had been made\r\nto Presidents Jackson, Van Buren, and Tyler, successively, by the Texas\r\ngovernment, but as often rejected by them as tending necessarily to a war\r\nwith Mexico; that power having distinctly and repeatedly declared that\r\nshe should regard such a step as a declaration of war.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party regaining the ascendency in the election of 1844,\r\nmade this annexation the issue of the presidential campaign. A majority\r\nof the people were in favor of it.\r\n\r\nThe Southern view, however, was not alone in its influence on this\r\ndecision. Indignities and injuries had been inflicted by the Mexicans on\r\nAmerican citizens in that country; its haughty, exclusive, and unfriendly\r\nspirit awakened strong indignation; and the Pacific coast of California,\r\nwith the mining regions of the northern interior of Mexico, both nearly\r\nuninhabited, were objects of desire to the American people. Thus a\r\nwish to extend the bounds of the Republic, and to chastise an insolent\r\nneighbor, combined with the ardent wishes of the pro-slavery interest,\r\nto lead the nation to determine on a war, somewhat ungenerously, with a\r\nneighbor notoriously too weak and disorganized for effectual resistance\r\nto the whole strength of the United States. The whole plan, as afterward\r\ncarried out, was arranged in the cabinet at Washington almost before\r\nhostilities had actually commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n1846.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 28—Gen. Taylor takes position with a small army at the\r\n      mouth of the Rio Grande opposite Matamoras.

Thornton.\r\n      He loses 16 men out of 63, and surrenders.\r\n\r\n    May 8—The battle of Palo Alto. Gen. Taylor with 2,300 men\r\n      defeats 6,000 Mexicans.

The\r\n      Mexicans fled in total rout across the Rio Grande. The object\r\n      of the war, so far as Texas was concerned, was gained; but\r\n      the Mexicans were still spirited, and California, Utah, and\r\n      New Mexico were not gained. An invasion and march on the city\r\n      of Mexico were the next steps.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—Congress ordered the raising of 50,000 men, and voted\r\n      $10,000,000 to carry on the war.\r\n\r\n    July 6—Monterey, on the California coast is taken by the\r\n      American navy under Com.

In return the United States gave them\r\n      $18,500,000 of which $3,500,000 was due by a former treaty to\r\n      citizens of this country and paid them by our government.\r\n\r\n      It will not be easy for an American to wholly condemn an\r\n      act that gave us California and the fertile valleys and\r\n      vast mining territory of the Pacific slope as well as New\r\n      Mexico, or the chastisement which the Mexicans had merited\r\n      for their barbarity; though he may blame the eagerness for\r\n      the acquisition of territory and the support of slavery that\r\n      led us to invade another country and humble her pride. The\r\n      ability of Americans as soldiers would appear by this war\r\n      to be unrivalled, and, in that view arouses our pride. The\r\n      moral sense of the world must ever be shocked by war, though\r\n      there seem many cases in which it is far the least of two\r\n      evils. Our government was fairly generous so far as it dared\r\n      be in dealing with the vanquished, as soon as its demands\r\n      for territory were satisfied. It is also evident that this\r\n      territory will be better developed and governed than would\r\n      have been the case under Mexican rule.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 14—Oregon receives a Territorial government.\r\n\r\n    Nov.—Gen.

By the end of this year it was a populous region.\r\n      The mass of American immigrants were from the northern\r\n      States, and disapproved of slavery, while the special end\r\n      of the Mexican war was to procure more territory for that\r\n      institution. At this time a violent contest was waged in\r\n      Congress over that admission. It was not ended until late in\r\n      the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1850.\r\n\r\n    Jan.—Gen. Twiggs obtains the consent of the Seminoles of\r\n      Florida to emigrate to the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 13—President Taylor sends the constitution of California\r\n      to Congress. There were many threats of secession in case\r\n      California was admitted free.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 7—Mr. Webster’s great speech for the Union.\r\n\r\n    May 8—The “Omnibus Bill” reported by Henry Clay.\r\n\r\n    ” 18—A private expedition from the south under command of\r\n      Lopez invades Cuba. They are driven off with a loss of 30\r\n      killed and executed as pirates, on the 19th.

Fillmore becomes acting\r\n      President.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 9-20—A committee of thirteen, of which Henry Clay was\r\n      chairman, had been appointed Apr. 19th, and they had prepared\r\n      four measures forming a compromise between the North and\r\n      South as to slavery, which were debated and passed into\r\n      laws, receiving the concurrence of the President: First,\r\n      the South conceded to the North the admission of California\r\n      as a free State, and the abolition of the slave trade in\r\n      the District of Columbia; Second, the North conceded to the\r\n      South a stringent Fugitive Slave Law, and the organization\r\n      of Territorial Governments in New Mexico and Utah without\r\n      mention of slavery, but in the understanding that they were\r\n      finally to form slave States. The real gain was to the North,\r\n      as anti-slavery was advanced two steps, while the Fugitive\r\n      Law could not be generally enforced in the North from the\r\n      invincible aversion of the people to it, and the Southern\r\n      people were not sufficiently migratory in their habits to\r\n      introduce slavery into distant regions not naturally adapted\r\n      to that institution. Still the question was laid aside for\r\n      the present.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 19—Richard M.

These three were the ablest and\r\n      most esteemed statesmen of their day.\r\n\r\n    Nov.—The seventeenth presidential election occurred. Franklin\r\n      Pierce was elected. He was the Democratic nominee. Gen.\r\n      Scott, Whig, was defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n1853.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—Pierce inaugurated President.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 11—Proclamation of President Pierce against the invasion\r\n      of Cuba by armed Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n1854.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 23—An important treaty of commerce negotiated with the\r\n      empire of Japan by Com. Perry, which opened a new era in the\r\n      progress of that country, and of United States commerce and\r\n      influence in Asia.\r\n\r\n    May 30—The failure of the compromise measures of 1850 to\r\n      realize the hopes of the South from the rapid development\r\n      of anti-slavery views in the North caused the subject to be\r\n      again agitated, and the Missouri Compromise, which stopped\r\n      the formation of slave States north of its south boundary\r\n      line, was repealed; the question of the admission of slavery\r\n      into Kansas and Nebraska, both being north of that line,\r\n      being referred by the famous “Kansas-Nebraska Bill” to the\r\n      “squatters,” or first settlers. This was called “squatter\r\n      sovereignty.” This measure gave satisfaction to the South,\r\n      but was strongly reprobated by many of the Northern people.\r\n      Both sides prepared to renew the contest there, and civil\r\n      war raged in Kansas for near three years. Each side sought\r\n      to secure its end which terminated in favor of the North.\r\n      The South could not compete with it in numbers nor drive the\r\n      extra numbers away. This was the last hope of the South for\r\n      preserving equilibrium in the general government.\r\n\r\n      The Democratic party in the North, anxious to soothe and\r\n      conciliate the South, and not holding so advanced opinions\r\n      against slavery, was still strong enough to maintain itself\r\n      in power in the administration; but the Republican party,\r\n      formed about this time by the dissolution of the Whig party,\r\n      constantly grew in numbers and influence, and, by the end\r\n      of the next administration its numbers were so large and\r\n      the ultimate result so certain that the South resolved on\r\n      secession rather than give up their favorite institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1855.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 24—The Court of Claims, an important relief to Congress\r\n      and to claimants against the government, was established in\r\n      Washington, by Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n1856.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—A Free State Legislature assembles in Kansas. It\r\n      adopted a constitution and prepared to apply for admission\r\n      into the Union.\r\n\r\n    Nov.—The eighteenth presidential election took place. James\r\n      Buchanan was elected against J. C. Fremont and Millard\r\n      Fillmore. Buchanan was the Democratic candidate; Fremont,\r\n      Republican, and Fillmore, American, or “know nothing”\r\n      candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n1857.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 2—Nathaniel Banks of Mass., a Republican, is elected\r\n      Speaker of the House of Representatives. It had required two\r\n      months and 133 ballotings to settle this point; indicating\r\n      the nearly equal balance of parties, and the final success of\r\n      the Republican element in the popular branch of Congress.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 4—Buchanan inaugurated President.\r\n\r\n      The next three years (after the decision of the Kansas\r\n      troubles) were marked by the unnatural quiet that forebodes\r\n      the storm. Anti-slavery feeling was maturing in the North,\r\n      and discontent and secession tendencies in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n1858.\r\n\r\n    May 11—Minnesota admitted into the Union as a State.\r\n\r\n\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 14—Oregon admitted into the Union as a State. The\r\n      admission of these two without any corresponding ones in the\r\n      South indicated the strength of Northern sentiment, and that\r\n      the South had given up the struggle in that way. John Brown’s\r\n      raid on Harper’s Ferry, in this year, as showing the tone of\r\n      Northern feeling, still further estranged the South from the\r\n      Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nWas the inevitable result of an antagonism of interests, sentiments,\r\nand social structure in the two great sections of the Union—the North\r\nand the South. The foundation of these tendencies was laid before the\r\nformation of the Union, in early colonial times. The conflict commenced\r\nas soon as a close union was attempted, and the Constitution was adopted\r\nonly through the personal influence of Washington and other statesmen of\r\nthat time, and from the general conviction that it was essential to the\r\nprotection of the new nation from England and other European powers. Some\r\nprovisions of the Constitution involved a compromise between the North\r\nand the South; and a constant series of compromises was required to be\r\narranged from time to time, down to this period.\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery it was believed by many of the revolutionary\r\nfathers, would expire of itself at no distant time; but the value of\r\nthe cotton cultivated at the South, and the intimate relations that\r\nslavery bore to the social life, made it profitable and agreeable to\r\nthat section, and they held to it with great tenacity. Meanwhile the\r\ncompromises of the Constitution grew more and more disagreeable to the\r\nNorth. The requirement of that instrument—that persons held to service\r\nin the South, and becoming fugitives in the North, should be returned\r\nby them—was objected to on humane and religious grounds, and they found\r\nslavery an industrial embarrassment. The enterprise and vigor of the\r\nnorthern population gave their section a more rapid growth, and its\r\npolitical power became continually greater.\r\n\r\nBut three ways of peacefully avoiding the conflict were open: the North\r\nmust fully carry out the spirit of concession that gave birth to the\r\nUnion, the South must consent, sooner or later, to abolish its peculiar\r\ninstitutions, or they must agree to separate. Interest, habit, and the\r\naristocratic pride of the South forbade the second; while, in the North,\r\ninterest, religious sentiment, and the workingman’s pride as decidedly\r\nforbade the first. The natural relation of the two sections, especially\r\nby the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, so essential to the commercial\r\ninterests of the Western States: the improbability of maintaining\r\namicable intercourse, with slavery in the South, and fugitives from it to\r\nproduce constant irritation; the apparent probability that, if the right\r\nof dissolution were conceded, the West, and the Pacific States would\r\nfollow this example; and the conviction that the true interests of the\r\nwhole country, internal and external, required an indissoluble Union,\r\ninspired the majority of the northern people to resist disunion at every\r\ncost. On the other hand, the South claimed the right to depart in peace.\r\nThus, war was inevitable; nor can it be correctly affirmed that any\r\nparty, or any generation, or either section of the Union, was properly\r\nresponsible for so lamentable a result. Each section, generation, and\r\nparty follows the line of its own interest, ideas, and habits. It is\r\na law of humanity, and each sees therein its duty and pleasure. While\r\ninterests do not clash very seriously, while ideas are not sharply and\r\nclearly defined, and while habits are yet unsettled, compromises may be\r\nreadily effected. Humanity, taken together, in the most advanced society\r\nheretofore known to men, is not yet capable of views so high, liberal,\r\nand far-seeing as to free it from the possibility of such conflicts. It\r\nwill, however, reach that height, in the course of time.\r\n\r\nWe could not reasonably have expected either the North or the South to\r\nhave acted differently from what they did. While so gigantic a war was\r\nan immense evil; to allow the right of peaceable secession would have\r\nbeen ruin to the enterprise and thrift of the industrious laborer, and\r\nkeen-eyed business man of the North. It would have been the greatest\r\ncalamity of the age. War was less to be feared.\r\n\r\nThe Southerner, generous, warm blooded, accustomed to rule and make his\r\nown will the law of others in his home, courageous and fiery, could not\r\ngive way. Besides secession would be less damaging to him. He would own\r\nthe outlets to much of Northern commerce, he had a bond of union of the\r\nSouthern States in the common institution of slavery, and a monopoly of\r\nthe world’s cotton that must soon secure profitable alliances in Europe.\r\nSecession was commenced peaceably, and the Southern government fairly\r\nconsolidated before the trumpet sounded to battle. The Democratic party,\r\nthen in possession of the administration of the general government, had\r\nlong been in close relations with the South. It was impossible for it to\r\nrealize the momentous character of the crisis, or to help sympathizing\r\nmore or less with the views and feelings of the South; it was near the\r\nclose of its period of rule; and it left the active management of the\r\nherculean difficulties of the situation to the incoming administration of\r\nthe Republican party. The whole country was quiet, failing, perhaps, as\r\nwell as the Democrats, to realize the significance of the events taking\r\nplace. It was a period of breathless waiting for what would come next.\r\nThe signal was given by the South. Fort Sumpter in South Carolina, a\r\nnational fort, was bombarded April 12th, 1861. It was an electric shock.\r\nThe North answered the summons by a note of defiance, and mustered for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe South was better prepared, more alert, more accustomed to arms, and\r\nsecured, at first, many advantages. She also had the advantage of being\r\non the defensive when the contest became close. But, as the months ran\r\ninto years, the courage and iron resolution of the North did not falter.\r\nShe had the advantage of numbers, of the general government, of wealth,\r\nand of naval force. Step by step she conquered, holding all she gained,\r\ngrew skillful and wise by defeat, and, April 8th, 1865, the main army\r\nof the Confederates surrendered, and the war was over; the gallant\r\nSouth succumbed to the plucky North. It was a predestined conclusion.\r\nThe free States were necessarily the strongest, and their strength was\r\nsupported and inspired by religious sentiment and enthusiasm. The Union,\r\nso important to the world and to civil liberty, was preserved, but at\r\nfearful cost.\r\n\r\nProbably 500,000 lives were sacrificed altogether, on both sides; and\r\neight or nine billions of dollars. The desolation of the South, which had\r\nbeen mainly the theater of these mighty conflicts; the extreme change\r\nin pecuniary circumstances and social life there; the affliction, to\r\nfreemen, of the subjection, however mild and temperate, necessary under\r\nthe circumstances to be imposed, for the time, by the federal government;\r\nthe great loss of valuable life to both sides; the immense debt of the\r\ngovernment, with the unavoidable demoralization of certain parts of\r\nsociety, everywhere, by the license of war, and many other evils form the\r\ndark side of the picture.\r\n\r\nYet, nothing could outweigh the value of the Union especially when freed\r\nfrom the discordant element that now disappeared. It must be long before\r\nall wounds can be healed. When that time shall come both North and South\r\nwill be recompensed for all they have suffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 6—Four parties contested this election: the Republicans\r\n      voted for Abraham Lincoln—the Democrats for Stephen A.\r\n      Douglas and J. C. Breckenridge. The old Whigs or Peace party,\r\n      ignoring the dangerous political strife, voted for John Bell.\r\n      Lincoln was elected.

Beauregard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nFIRST PHASE OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach side hesitated to strike the first blow; but the South, being\r\nbest prepared, and to end a suspense that threatened to be hurtful to\r\ntheir cause, opened the conflict by the bombardment of Ft. Sumter.\r\nEach now hastened preparations with vigor. Yet so long had been the\r\nintimate, friendly relations, that neither could believe in a long,\r\ndeadly struggle. More than three months passed, during which frequent\r\nskirmishes occurred; but the leaders avoided bringing on a general\r\nbattle. The Southern forces advanced toward Washington, but stopped short\r\nof an attack, sending out small bodies to make trial efforts, and get\r\npossession of important points.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bull Run was the first great, serious combat. The brilliant\r\nbravery of Southern troops would have been overcome but for an opportune\r\nreinforcement at the decisive moment. The leaders did not feel it safe to\r\npursue the vanquished Federals to Washington. There was a large reserve\r\nforce there. Thus, if they won a battle they lost the object sought—the\r\ncapture of the national Capital—and the Union forces, though defeated,\r\ngained the most important point—the protection of Washington.\r\n\r\nBoth sides now recognized the magnitude of the undertaking; the\r\nindomitable resolution of their opponents; and the need of thoroughly\r\ndisciplining their troops, of organizing all branches of the military\r\nand naval service, and gathering stores, and distributing forces in\r\naccordance with the plan proposed by each.\r\n\r\nThis period continued until Feb., 1862. The U. S. Navy was increased from\r\n42 vessels at the beginning of the war to about 300 at the close of this\r\npreparatory period. These blockaded the South and served for transport\r\nand attack. Two series of operations were planned by the U. S. government\r\nfor the land forces: one in the Mississippi Valley and one in Virginia.\r\nIn the meantime the Confederate leaders saw that it was impossible to\r\ninvade the North as they had proposed without long preparation and large\r\narmies. They organized with speed but were thrown on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 7—Steamer Atlantic, with troops and supplies for Ft.\r\n      Sumter, sailed from New York.\r\n\r\n    ” 8—The Federal Government notified South Carolina that\r\n      provisions would be sent to Maj.

Confederate authorities refuse to receive them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PHASE OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe previous period, though abounding in battles, so-called, were really\r\nskirmishes of detached bodies without any well defined plan. It covered\r\nmuch of the surface of all the Border States, but especially Virginia and\r\nMissouri, and was a trial of bravery and strategy in which both parties\r\nlearned how to fight, and of what metal their opponents were made.\r\n\r\nThe Second Period covered about eleven months—from the advance of the\r\nFederal armies on the South in West and East, in Feb., to the close of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nThis period is defined in its commencement, by the surrounding of the\r\nsouthern territory on nearly all sides by the Union forces, both naval\r\nand military; and the inauguration of aggressive movements both by sea\r\nand land; and in its close by the failure of the two southern Generals,\r\nBragg in the West, and Lee in the East, in the endeavor to break through\r\nthis beleaguering line. It was an immense and desperate conflict.\r\n\r\nIn the West it began by the attack of Grant on Fts. Henry and Donelson,\r\nfollowed up by the battle of Pittsburg Landing, and various other\r\noperations in Tennessee and Mississippi; the advance of McClellan on\r\nRichmond, and his campaign in the Peninsula, his failure and return to\r\nWashington; the strengthening of the Southern Army, and the advance of\r\nLee northward into Maryland and his defeat there. The disasters to the\r\nUnion army in Virginia served to check the successes of the Western Army\r\nunder Grant, Sherman, Buell, Rosecranz and others; the Confederate forces\r\nin the West were increased under Bragg, who checked the advance of U. S.\r\ntroops eastward at Chattanooga, and he himself assumed the offensive, by\r\ninvading Kentucky. He was compelled to retreat again to Chattanooga. Thus\r\nthere was an alternation of great successes and great reverses on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThe Union Army commenced with about 600,000 men, and the Southern with\r\nabout 400,000. They both largely added to these during the campaign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the navy was not idle. A foothold was gained in South Carolina,\r\nand in North Carolina, as well as at Norfolk, Virginia, the mouth of the\r\nMississippi was opened by Admiral Farragut, and New Orleans captured.\r\nThe compression of a vast naval and land force was applied in all\r\ndirections, even west of the Mississippi. Missouri had been quieted by\r\ndriving the organized forces into the border of Arkansas, and inflicting\r\non them a heavy blow at Pea Ridge. This, however, was not followed up;\r\nthe disasters to the Union cause in Virginia, and the rebound of the\r\nConfederates in East Tennessee, requiring concentration.\r\n\r\nThe South had shown the most determined bravery, and great steadiness in\r\ndisaster; and activity, and ability in making the most of circumstances.\r\nThe speed with which she collected other levies and armies and used them\r\nwithin the campaign greatly impressed the authorities and people of the\r\nFederal government. They were convinced that the blacks left at home to\r\ntill the ground, or employed in the fortifications and other labor of\r\nthe war, contributed much to the strength of the South; enabling them to\r\nconcentrate all their resources on a given point with extreme rapidity,\r\nand to use all their best fighting material. After so vast an outlay, to\r\nsee their immense armies defied and the Northern States threatened with\r\ninvasion was discouraging. Hitherto slavery had not been interfered with\r\nmuch, in deference to the sentiment in the Border States, and the views\r\nof the democratic party. The Union administration determined to weaken\r\nthe South by abstracting as much as possible of the slave element from it\r\nand to use it themselves. The issue of the Proclamation of Emancipation\r\nmarks a Third Phase of the War.\r\n\r\n\r\n1862.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 3—The Federal government decides to treat crews of\r\n      privateers taken in arms, not as pirates, but as prisoners of\r\n      war.\r\n\r\n    ” 5—Jesse D.

It was great honor to Union troops not to recognize\r\n      defeat on the 6th, and highly creditable to Confederates\r\n      to make a desperate stand and inflict an immense loss on\r\n      Federals on the 7th.

Meanwhile\r\nthe final details of the great operations, undertaken on both sides\r\nduring 1862, were wound up. The bold efforts of the South, in the East\r\nand West, to transfer the war into the North, and indemnify themselves\r\nfor the strict blockade of the coast by drawing supplies from the enemy,\r\nhad resulted in defeat and withdrawal; not unaccompanied with booty,\r\nespecially in the west, where Bragg’s train of supplies was said to have\r\nbeen 40 miles long. The southern people had failed in the main point,\r\nyet they had gained much. Federal reverses in the east had stopped the\r\nvictories in the west in mid career, both by withdrawing from those\r\narmies to the east, and adding to the Confederates from the same region.\r\nGrant and Sherman failed at Vicksburg, and Buell at Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nYet these reverses to the Union arms served to stimulate the north, and\r\nto demonstrate the energy, resources, and indomitable resolution of the\r\nNational government, and to undeceive the South as to the real sentiments\r\nof the great body of the Democratic party from which they had hoped\r\naid on an invasion in force. Several of the European Powers, who would\r\nhave liked to support the South, seeing the formidable character of the\r\nGeneral Government, drew back in fear. The South might have foreseen that\r\nher cause was really hopeless; but she was too American not to feel an\r\nunconquerable resolution to carry her point or perish. She strengthened\r\nher armies and prepared for another invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Federal armies were now (Jan. 1863,) about 800,000 strong; her navy\r\nconsisted of near 450 vessels, a large number being iron-clads. The\r\ngreat events of the campaign were Lee’s invasion of Pennsylvania and his\r\nretreat after the battle of Gettysburg, and Grant’s success at Vicksburg\r\nand Chattanooga. The resolution of the South, enveloped in the embrace\r\nof so mighty an antagonist, was wonderful; the unfaltering spirit, and\r\nreadiness of the northern people to furnish whatever was required for\r\nsuccess was still more so. The whole South, at least every State, was\r\nthe theater of many contests of more or less importance; but the main\r\ninterest centered on the Mississippi river, at Chattanooga and its\r\nvicinity, and on Gen. Lee’s army in Virginia or Pennsylvania. It was a\r\ncontest of giants; yet, struggle as she might, the South was doomed. At\r\nthe end of this year she was still strong, her armies were veterans, her\r\nspirit unbroken. The Federal Government had gained much, but it was step\r\nby step, inch by inch; and, in some parts, as in Virginia, what had been\r\ngained many times over, in territory, had been as often lost. Her general\r\ngain over the Confederate States lay most largely in the fatal process\r\nof exhaustion to which the vast operations of the Federal government\r\nforced the South. Increase of numbers made the battles more bloody and\r\nwasteful of life. The three leading events in this campaign—the capture\r\nof Vicksburg, (the battle of Chickamauga was a Confederate victory, but\r\nbalanced by that of Chattanooga,) the battle of Gettysburg, and the\r\nbattle of Chattanooga—were all decisive against the Confederates, yet\r\nleaving her strength for a long and vigorous contest of more than a year\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 1—The year opened with a Confederate success at\r\n      Galveston, Texas.

Longstreet attacks Knoxville and is repulsed with\r\n      loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN OF 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a lull, for a time, in the tempest of war. The Confederate\r\nforces had lost ground that they could hardly hope to regain. The\r\nMississippi river and Eastern Tennessee, both of supreme importance to\r\nthe Confederacy, were in possession of the Union armies, which grew ever\r\nstronger. They were now about 1,000,000 men, and the navy had increased\r\nto over 600 vessels. This force was soon put in vigorous hands, that\r\ngripped fast what they once held. The misfortune of many commanders and\r\ncontinual changes, from political rather than military considerations,\r\nbegan to be well understood. Grant had gained so uniformly when others\r\nhad failed, he was recognized as so tenacious and unwearied, that he\r\nreceived and held the confidence of the people and the government.\r\nThis was a point of great importance for shortening the war; for the\r\nSouthern people were still resolute, had still a vast country, were\r\non the defensive in a smaller region than before, and could resist\r\nmore effectively with a smaller army. It still made a most gallant\r\nand determined resistance which the vast resources of the national\r\ngovernment did not enable them to overcome for a year and a half. The\r\ncountry was still covered with detached bodies of troops. A desultory war\r\nwas maintained where strong armies failed to hold the ground, or were\r\nconcentrated at a few points. The great movements were in Virginia and\r\nGeorgia. The secondary in Tennessee, in Mississippi, and Texas.\r\n\r\nIt took a year to break the will of the Southern people after they were\r\nreally conquered. This period covers the year 1864; 1865 furnishes only\r\nthe dying struggles of the Confederacy, already mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment of Charleston continued during the preceding month. Some\r\ncavalry movements were made, the President of the U. S. offered amnesty\r\nto all who would take an oath of allegiance, and Gen. Butler announced\r\nthat the Confederate government refused to receive any more supplies for\r\nUnion prisoners from the North.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 7—Three blockade runners captured.\r\n\r\n    ” 11—Two more were destroyed, making 22 in a few months.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Mr. Vanderbilt, having presented a steamer worth\r\n      $800,000 to the U. S. government, received the thanks of\r\n      Congress.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 1—The President of the U. S. ordered a draft of 500,000\r\n      men.\r\n\r\n    ” 5—Two English steamers, with supplies for the South,\r\n      captured.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—Cotton worth $700,000 burned at Wilmington, N. C.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—Negro troops cover the retreat of a defeated white Union\r\n      force at Olustee, Fla.\r\n\r\n    ” 28—The large armies being broken up or concentrated, and\r\n      the lines of communication very much interrupted, many Union\r\n      cavalry raids, aiming to break the lines of communication\r\n      by railroad completely, to lay waste the country, and to\r\n      free the negroes, who were raising supplies for the Southern\r\n      armies, in the far interior, were undertaken. That of Sherman\r\n      to Meridian, in Miss., and of Grierson and Smith, and many\r\n      smaller ones, were executed during this month. The damage to\r\n      railroads and the supplies destroyed were incalculable. 18\r\n      blockade runners and other vessels bringing supplies to the\r\n      South were destroyed during the month.\r\n\r\n    Mar. 2—Gen. Grant made Lt. General; the only one who had\r\n      reached that dignity since Gen. Washington—Gen. Scott being\r\n      Lt. Gen. only by brevet.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—Gen. Grant made Commander-in-chief of the U. S. armies.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—The President of the U. S. calls for 200,000 more men.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Confederate Gen.

President accepts them.\r\n\r\n    May 2—400 Union prisoners are brought to Annapolis nearly\r\n      starved.\r\n\r\n    ” 4—Gen. Grant crosses the Rapidan in Va. and commences\r\n      operations in the Wilderness.

Costs Grant 30,000 (5,000 were prisoners) and Lee\r\n      10,000. Lee was intrenched and familiar with the ground,\r\n      which was highly unfavorable to the Union army.\r\n\r\n    ” 6—Gen. Sherman confronts Gen. Joe Johnson near Chattanooga.\r\n      Sherman has near 100,000; Johnson 60,000.\r\n\r\n    ” 7—Lee retreats toward Spottsylvania Court-House. Union army\r\n      follows, fighting.\r\n\r\n      To this date 150,000 Southern soldiers had been made\r\n      prisoners during the course of the war.\r\n\r\n    May 8—Battle of Spottsylvania; result indecisive.\r\n\r\n    ” 10—Battle of Spottsylvania continued. Still indecisive.\r\n      Losses to each side 10,000 men.\r\n\r\n    ” 12—Lee and Grant fight again, without victory by either.\r\n\r\n    ” 13—Sheridan destroyed Lee’s depot of supplies in his rear,\r\n      at Beaver Dam.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—Sherman drives Johnson from Resaca after two days’\r\n      fighting.\r\n\r\n    ” 21—Lee is flanked at Spottsylvania, and retires to the\r\n      North Anna.\r\n\r\n    ” 23—Morgan (Confederate cavalry) enters Ky. with 4,000 men.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Sheridan rejoins Grant, after a brilliant series of\r\n      daring deeds in the rear of Lee. Gen. Stuart, a very able\r\n      Confederate cavalry leader, is killed in this raid.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—Grant again flanked Lee, crossing the Pamunky to\r\n      Hanovertown.\r\n\r\n    June 1—Battle of Cold Harbor, north of, and near, Richmond.\r\n      It was fought with the utmost bravery and obstinacy, but\r\n      gained no more decisive end than the destruction of men and\r\n      material involved. This was very severe on Lee, from the\r\n      smaller number he had to fall back on.\r\n\r\n    ” 7—Abraham Lincoln renominated for the presidency of the U.\r\n      S.\r\n\r\n    ” 14—Gen. Polk (a Southern bishop) killed.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—An unsuccessful assault for three days on Petersburg.\r\n      Union losses 10,000 men.\r\n\r\n    ” 18—To this time Grant had lost 64,000 men—Lee 38,000 during\r\n      this campaign.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—Steamer Kearsarge sinks the famous Alabama, on the coast\r\n      of France.\r\n\r\n    ” 20—Petersburg strongly reinforced by Lee.\r\n\r\n    ” 27—Sherman, pushing Johnson at Keneshaw, meets a severe\r\n      repulse. In one month he had driven Johnson 100 miles, fought\r\n      six battles, and killed, wounded or taken prisoner 17,000\r\n      men. He followed Grant’s principle, and “flanked” him. A\r\n      retreat was the result.\r\n\r\n    July 1—Public debt over $1,740,000,000.\r\n\r\n    ” 9—Gen. Early, with 20,000 Confederate troops, passes into\r\n      Grant’s rear, and makes a hasty march north into Maryland.\r\n      This day he gained a victory over Gen. Wallace, but his\r\n      losses were so great that he was hindered in his design of\r\n      capturing Washington, though within six miles of it at one\r\n      time.

Sherman takes possession next\r\n      day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1864 closed in general disaster to the Confederacy. Sherman had\r\nbroken the Confederate power in Georgia, destroyed its communications\r\nwith the Mississippi States, and taken Savannah. Gen. Thomas had\r\nbroken up Hood’s army, in Tennessee, and Grant had closely beleagured\r\nthe Southern army in Virginia within Richmond and its defenses; while\r\nSheridan had dealt blow after blow on Early, in the Shenandoah Valley,\r\nand quite ruined his army.\r\n\r\nThe future operations required the subjugation of the interiors of\r\nNorth and South Carolina, the taking of a few forts on the coast, and\r\nthe capture of Lee’s army in Richmond. The only other army of strength,\r\nthe remnant of Hood’s forces, was in the Southern interior. The Federal\r\ngovernment was stronger than ever, both by sea and land. The Southern\r\npeople were much discouraged; their finances ruined; their fighting\r\nmen mostly disabled, scattered, forced into submission, or, hopeless\r\nof ultimate success, had voluntarily withdrawn from the contest in so\r\nlarge numbers that the Confederate forces were everywhere inferior,\r\nand only upheld by the indomitable pride and bravery inherent in the\r\nAnglo-American. They would submit only when necessity absolutely\r\ncompelled them; and thus saved their honor, in their own eyes. They\r\nhad made a fatal mistake, and they reaped the full harvest of ruin.\r\nYet, their prolonged resistance served to utterly annihilate slavery;\r\nraised the negroes to the honorable position of Defenders of the Union;\r\nand, the last of Jan., 1865, an amendment to the U. S. Constitution was\r\nprepared forever abolishing slavery in the country. In the end the blacks\r\nbecame citizens. We have now but a short record to complete our View of\r\nthe Civil War. The South had still over 100,000 men in arms, but they\r\nwere surrounded, cut off from supplies, outnumbered, and pressed with\r\nrelentless vigor. This was Grant’s policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 14—Vessels are sent from Boston and New York with large\r\n      supplies from the charitable, for Southern sufferers in\r\n      Savannah, Geo.\r\n\r\n    ” 15—Ft. Fisher, on the coast of N. C., captured by Gen.\r\n      Terry, in conjunction with the U. S. fleet. It is the last\r\n      stronghold of the South on the sea.\r\n\r\n      Edward Everett died, at Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n    ” 16—The magazine at Ft. Fisher exploded, killing and\r\n      wounding 300 Union men.\r\n\r\n    ” 17—A Federal monitor blown up by torpedoes, in Charleston\r\n      Harbor, S.

After fighting and manouvering 3 days, Johnston\r\n      retreated having lost 3,000 men. Sherman lost 1,646.\r\n\r\n    ” 25—Ft. Steadman, near Petersburg, Va., captured by\r\n      Confederates, but was immediately retaken, with 2,000\r\n      prisoners. This attack was made by Lee, preparatory to\r\n      evacuating Richmond. Grant had about 120,000 troops, Lee\r\n      70,000.\r\n\r\n    ” 29—Sheridan commences an expedition to the rear of Richmond\r\n      to cut off Lee’s retreat South.\r\n\r\n    ” 31—Sheridan attacked and hard pushed by Lee’s forces, but\r\n      at night they fall back.\r\n\r\n    Apr. 1—Sheridan, in turn, follows the Confederates, and\r\n      drives them toward Richmond. He takes more than 5,000\r\n      prisoners. This was the battle of Five Forks. It was fatal to\r\n      Lee’s retreat.\r\n\r\n    ” 2—Grant’s forces make a grand assault. It is successful,\r\n      and Lee prepares to evacuate Richmond. President Davis leaves\r\n      his capital in haste, for Danville, N. C. Gen.

Sherman arranges preliminaries for the surrender of\r\n      all the remaining Confederate forces, with Gen. Johnston,\r\n      commanding Southern army in N. C., with consent of\r\n      Confederate Sec. of War and Jeff. Davis. It includes the\r\n      basis of a general peace, and a policy of reconstruction.\r\n      It is sent to the Federal government for their approval or\r\n      rejection.\r\n\r\n    ” 19—Funeral ceremonies of President Lincoln, at Washington.\r\n      Funeral services are held all over the North.

They were mostly discharged and paid in the\r\nnext three months. The entire enlistments in the Federal army, during the\r\nwhole war, were 2,688,523. Many were re-enlistments. It is believed that\r\nthe whole number of individuals forming the armies was only 1,500,000.\r\n75 per cent. were native Americans, 9 per cent. Germans, and 7 per cent.\r\nIrish. Various nationalities made up the remaining 9 per cent.\r\n\r\nOf this million and a half 56,000 were killed in battle, 35,000 died\r\nin hospitals of their wounds received in battle, and 184,000 died in\r\nhospitals of disease. Many afterwards died, and others were ruined in\r\nhealth for life.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by the Adjutant General of the Confederate army, since\r\nthe close of the war, that the available Confederate force during the\r\nentire war was 600,000, and that they never had more than 200,000 in the\r\nfield at any one time. This would seem likely to be an underestimate, but\r\nis the nearest to official data that we have. He states the entire force\r\nopposing the 1,000,000 men in the closing campaign to have been 100,000.\r\nThere is reason to believe that the Confederates killed, and the wounded\r\nand sick who died in hospital, was about 300,000.\r\n\r\nThe entire amount expended by the National government, by States,\r\ncounties and towns, and contributed in other ways to the comfort or\r\nsustenance of the army, is computed at $4,000,000,000. The support of\r\nthe Southern army cannot be ascertained, but it is thought that those\r\nexpenses and the destruction of property inflicted about an equal loss on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThese losses in life and property are fearful; but they are the price of\r\nFreedom and of Nationality. The general prosperity of the country has\r\nmade it richer than before, while natural increase and immigration have\r\nfilled the places vacant by death.\r\n\r\nThe South was hopeless and exhausted at the close of the war. It had been\r\nfeared that a guerrilla war, the most desolating and bloody of all wars,\r\nwould follow the defeat of the great armies. It could result only in\r\ndestruction of what remained to the Southern people, and they submitted\r\nquietly to their fate. Various excesses and deeds of blood were indeed\r\ncommitted, but they were not sympathized with by the mass of the people.\r\nIt was only the desperate and lawless class that came to the surface\r\nnaturally in war.\r\n\r\nMany of the influential Southern leaders counseled submission to\r\ninevitable necessity, and themselves set the example. The policy of\r\nreconstruction adopted by the National government, excluded, at first,\r\nall who had taken a part in the rebellion from political influence.\r\nThe loyal element, small as it was, was alone to restore the Southern\r\nStates to their place in the Union. It was, however, proposed to admit\r\nothers, both individuals and classes, to participation in political\r\naction as they proved themselves trustworthy and loyal to the new order\r\nof things. After some years, and when it was felt to be quite safe, these\r\ndisabilities were nearly all removed.\r\n\r\nThe most distasteful act of the General Government, to the people of\r\nthe South, was clothing the blacks with the rights of citizens. They\r\nreceived the elective franchise, and assisted to rule over their former\r\nmasters. It was considered necessary, since they had now no masters to\r\nbe interested in them, to give them the power to protect themselves, and\r\nto elevate them to something of influence and respectability by force of\r\nthe ballot. That advantage given them, they must take their chances with\r\nothers, and win their own way. They had been loyal to the Union, which\r\nstrongly recommended this policy to the government. The Northern people\r\nwho now settled in the South and the blacks mainly reorganized the State\r\ngovernments. This was the chief punishment inflicted on the Southern\r\npeople in retaliation for the war they had waged with such fearful\r\nenergy. It was a clemency quite unexampled in history. No blood was\r\nshed after they laid down their arms. The assassination of the beloved\r\nPresident Lincoln made the North thoroughly angry, but no vengeance was\r\ntaken except on those believed to be immediately connected with the\r\natrocious deed. The most lively indignation had long been felt at the\r\ndreadful treatment experienced by prisoners of war in some of the prisons\r\nof the South; but the government and the people contented themselves with\r\nthe punishment of the governor of Andersonville prison, on due civil\r\ntrial and conviction.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the conduct of the Northern people was extremely\r\nmagnanimous. The dissolution of the Union would have been an irreparable\r\nloss to them; they resolved not to suffer it; and, with extraordinary\r\nenergy, they put in the field more than a million and a half of men, and\r\nnear 700 vessels, to subdue it, and suffered no reverses to discourage\r\nthem until this was done. When resistance ceased and the Union was\r\nsecure, they exacted only the pledges necessary to keep it safe.\r\nAppreciating the unfortunate condition to which nearly all the before\r\nprosperous classes of the South were reduced, they aided them in their\r\ndistress, ceased at once all hostile action, and left them to recover\r\nfrom their disasters under as favorable circumstances as their own\r\nconduct warranted. The South naturally felt an affection for her Lost\r\nCause, proportionate to the sacrifices she had made and the suffering she\r\nhad endured for it. Time, and busy care to develop the vast resources\r\nthat slavery had, in great part, neglected, would gradually restore them\r\nto right feeling, and the state of mind fitting them for citizenship.\r\nThis, in part, has already taken place, and, by and by, the Bonds of the\r\nWhole Union will be more firmly cemented than ever before.

They are naturally a standard of procedure in all public bodies\r\nin this country so far as the circumstances are parallel; they have been\r\ncarefully compiled and adopted by our highest popular Legislative Body\r\nduring the course of more than three-quarters of a century, and may\r\ntherefore be considered thoroughly well adapted to the genius of our\r\npeople and the character of our institutions; and they were originally\r\nbased on Jefferson’s Manual, compiled by him for the use, and at the\r\nrequest of the Senate when, as Vice-President of the United States, he\r\nbecame its presiding officer, and was digested by him from the usages of\r\nthe English Parliament and other Legislative bodies in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe value of this manual is attested by its use continued to the present\r\nday, so far as it is applicable. The Rules of the House are therefore\r\nrepresentative of the wisdom of the Old World on this point as well as of\r\nthe usages of the New.\r\n\r\nThey deserve to be carefully studied by American citizens above any other\r\nbody of parliamentary rules for several reasons besides those mentioned\r\nabove. Hardly any other will be likely to contain so many points of\r\nadaptation to popular use; every one should be fairly acquainted with\r\nthe prevailing usages that he may be ready to act his part well if\r\ncalled on to preside in any public meeting; all who read the reports of\r\ncongressional doings require such acquaintance with parliamentary usage\r\nto fully appreciate many points in such reports, and these Rules are a\r\nfine illustration of the spirit of our government and the genius of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nWe see, in the most impressive manner, that the utmost pain is taken to\r\nmake Legislative work orderly, decorous, and as rapid as is consistent\r\nwith due care that what is done shall be well and carefully done; that\r\nno pains are spared, _in regulations_, that every legislator shall have\r\nthe means of knowing all that is his special business to know; and we\r\ndiscover that proper care is taken to see that economy and faithfulness\r\nare constantly observed by all the officers of the government. If this\r\nis not always actually the case there is, at least, no fault in the\r\n_arrangements, rules and orders_ to that effect. All the people should\r\nknow to what they may properly hold their Representatives accountable,\r\nand they will be prepared to judge of the extent of obedience or\r\ntransgression. The Rules are just and good. Let the people see that they\r\nare properly observed.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives has 160 Rules, the Senate 52, and the\r\nJoint Rules of the House and Senate, regulating their intercourse with\r\neach other, number 22. Whatever of difference exists between them is\r\nunimportant after due allowance is made for the different character and\r\nconstitution of the two bodies. The principles on which they are founded\r\nare identical.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDING RULES AND ORDERS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTY OF THE SPEAKER.\r\n\r\n1. He shall take the chair every day precisely at the hour to which the\r\nHouse shall have adjourned on the preceding day; shall immediately call\r\nthe members to order; and, on the appearance of a quorum, shall cause the\r\njournal of the preceding day to be read.\r\n\r\n2. He shall preserve order and decorum; may speak to points of order in\r\npreference to other members, rising from his seat for that purpose; and\r\nshall decide questions of order, subject to an appeal to the House by any\r\ntwo members—on which appeal no member shall speak more than once, unless\r\nby leave of the House.\r\n\r\n3. He shall rise to put a question, but may state it sitting.\r\n\r\n4. Questions shall be distinctly put in this form, to wit: “As many as\r\nare of opinion that (as the question may be) say _Aye_;” and after the\r\naffirmative voice is expressed, “As many as are of the contrary opinion\r\nsay _No_.” If the Speaker doubt, or a division be called for, the House\r\nshall divide; those in the affirmative of the question shall first rise\r\nfrom their seats, and afterwards those in the negative. If the Speaker\r\nstill doubt, or a count be required by at least one-fifth of the quorum\r\nof the members, the Speaker shall name two members, one from each side,\r\nto tell the members in the affirmative and negative—which being reported,\r\nhe shall rise and state the decision to the House.\r\n\r\n5.

All acts, addresses, and joint resolutions, shall be signed by the\r\nSpeaker; and all writs, warrants, and subpœnas, issued by order of the\r\nHouse, shall be under his hand and seal, attested by the clerk.\r\n\r\n9.

In all other cases of ballot than for committees, a majority of the\r\nvotes given shall be necessary to an election; and where there shall not\r\nbe such a majority on the first ballot, the ballots shall be repeated\r\nuntil a majority be obtained. And in all ballotings blanks shall be\r\nrejected, and not taken into the count in enumeration of the votes, or\r\nreported by the tellers.\r\n\r\n13.

The clerk shall cause an index to be prepared to the acts passed at\r\nevery session of Congress, and to be printed and bound with the acts.\r\n\r\n21. All contracts, bargains, or agreements, relative to the furnishing\r\nany matter or thing or for the performance of any labor for the House of\r\nRepresentatives, shall be made with the clerk, or approved by him, before\r\nany allowances shall be made therefor by the Committee of Accounts.\r\n\r\n22. It shall be the duty of the sergeant-at-arms to attend the House\r\nduring its sittings; to aid in the enforcement of order under the\r\ndirection of the Speaker; to execute the commands of the House from time\r\nto time; together with all such process, issued by authority thereof, as\r\nshall be directed to him by the Speaker.\r\n\r\n23.

And when any\r\nmember shall ask leave to vote, the Speaker shall propound to him the\r\nquestion, “Were you within the bar before the last name on the roll was\r\ncalled?” and if he shall answer in the negative the Speaker shall not\r\nfurther entertain the request of such member to vote: Provided, however,\r\nthat any member who was absent by leave of the House, may vote at any\r\ntime before the result is announced.\r\n\r\n30.

When a motion has been once made, and carried in the affirmative or\r\nnegative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move\r\nfor the reconsideration thereof, on the same or succeeding day; and such\r\nmotion shall take precedence of all other questions, except a motion to\r\nadjourn, and shall not be withdrawn after the said succeeding day without\r\nthe consent of the House; and thereafter any member may call it up for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n50. In filling up blanks, the largest sum and longest time shall be first\r\nput.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF BUSINESS OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n51.

On the first and fourth Friday and Saturday of each month the\r\ncalendar of private bills shall be called over (the chairman of the\r\nCommittee of the Whole House commencing the call where he left off the\r\nprevious day,) and the bills to the passage of which no objection shall\r\nthen be made shall be first considered and disposed of. But when a bill\r\nis again reached, after having been once objected to, the committee shall\r\nconsider and dispose of the same, unless it shall again be objected to by\r\nat least five members.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF BILLS ON LEAVE AND RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n130. All the States and Territories shall be called for bills on\r\nleave and resolutions on each alternate Monday during each session\r\nof Congress; and, if necessary to secure the object on said days,\r\nall resolutions which shall give rise to debate shall lie over for\r\ndiscussion, under the rules of the House already established; and\r\nthe whole of said days shall be appropriated to bills on leave and\r\nresolutions, until all the States and Territories are called through.\r\nAnd the Speaker shall first call the States and Territories for bills\r\non leave; and all bills so introduced during the first hour after the\r\njournal is read shall be referred, without debate, to their appropriate\r\ncommittees; provided, however, that a bill so introduced and referred\r\nshall not be brought back into the House upon a motion to reconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.\r\n\r\n131. Members having petitions and memorials to present, may hand them\r\nto the clerk, indorsing the same with their names, and the reference or\r\ndisposition to be made thereof; and such petitions and memorials shall\r\nbe entered on the journal, subject to the control and direction of the\r\nSpeaker; and if any petition or memorial be so handed in, which, in the\r\njudgment of the Speaker, is excluded by the rules, the same shall be\r\nreturned to the member from whom it was received.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION.\r\n\r\n132. The previous question shall be in this form: “Shall the main\r\nquestion be now put?” It shall only be admitted when demanded by a\r\nmajority of the members present; and its effect shall be to put an end\r\nto all debate, and to bring the House to a direct vote upon a motion to\r\ncommit if such motion shall have been made; and if this motion does not\r\nprevail, then upon amendments reported by a committee, if any; then upon\r\npending amendments, and then upon the main question. But its only effect,\r\nif a motion to postpone is pending, shall be to bring the House to a\r\nvote upon such motion. Whenever the House shall refuse to order the main\r\nquestion, the consideration of the subject shall be resumed as though no\r\nmotion for the previous question had been made. The House may also, at\r\nany time, on motion seconded by a majority of the members present, close\r\nall debate upon a pending amendment, or an amendment thereto, and cause\r\nthe question to be put thereon; and this shall not preclude any further\r\namendment or debate upon the bill. A call of the House shall not be in\r\norder after the previous question is seconded, unless it shall appear,\r\nupon an actual count by the Speaker, that no quorum is present.\r\n\r\n133. On a previous question there shall be no debate. All incidental\r\nquestions of order arising after a motion is made for the previous\r\nquestion and pending such motion, shall be decided, whether on appeal or\r\notherwise, without debate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ADMISSION ON THE FLOOR.\r\n\r\n134.

Stenographers and reporters, other than the official reporters of\r\nthe House, wishing to take down the debates, may be admitted by the\r\nSpeaker to the reporters’ gallery over the Speaker’s chair, but not on\r\nthe floor of the House; but no person shall be allowed the privilege of\r\nsaid gallery under the character of stenographer or reporter without a\r\nwritten permission of the Speaker, specifying the part of said gallery\r\nassigned to him; nor shall said stenographer or reporter be admitted to\r\nsaid gallery unless he shall state in writing for what paper or papers\r\nhe is employed to report; nor shall he be so admitted, or, if admitted,\r\nbe suffered to retain his seat, if he shall become an agent to prosecute\r\nany claim pending before Congress; and the Speaker shall give his written\r\npermission with this condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNFINISHED BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.\r\n\r\n136.

And\r\nwhen the Speaker, or any other member, shall inform the House that he has\r\ncommunications to make which he conceives ought to be kept secret, the\r\nHouse shall, in like manner, be cleared till the communication be made;\r\nthe House shall then determine whether the matter communicated requires\r\nsecrecy or not, and take order accordingly.\r\n\r\n138. The rule for paying witnesses summoned to appear before this House,\r\nor either of its committees, shall be as follows: for each day a witness\r\nshall attend, the sum of two dollars; for each mile he shall travel in\r\ncoming to or going from the place of examination, the sum of ten cents\r\neach way; but nothing shall be paid for traveling home when the witness\r\nhas been summoned at the place of trial.\r\n\r\n139.

The rules of parliamentary practice, comprised in Jefferson’s\r\nManual, shall govern the House in all cases to which they are applicable,\r\nand in which they are not inconsistent with the standing rules and orders\r\nof the House, and joint rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n145.

This loss is compensated by an\r\nequal number of births.\r\n\r\nThe average duration of life throughout the globe is thirty-three years.\r\nOne-fourth of its population dies before the seventh year, and one-half\r\nbefore the seventeenth. Out of 10,000 persons only one reaches his\r\nhundredth year; only one in 500 his eightieth; and only one in 100 his\r\nsixty-fifth.\r\n\r\nMarried people live longer than unmarried ones, and a tall man is likely\r\nto live longer than a short one. Until the fiftieth year women have a\r\nbetter chance of life than men; but beyond that period the chances are\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nSixty-five persons out of one thousand marry. The months of June and\r\nDecember are those in which marriages are most frequent.\r\n\r\nChildren born in spring are generally stronger than those born in other\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nBirths and deaths chiefly occur at night.\r\n\r\nThe number of men able to bear arms is but one-eighth of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICANS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are some 14,580,000 persons of African descent\r\non this continent. In the United States they number 4,880,000; Brazil\r\n4,200,000; Cuba and Porto Rico 1,500,000; South and Central American\r\nRepublics 1,100,000; Hayti 1,350,000; British Possessions 800,000;\r\nFrench, 250,000; Dutch and Mexican 400,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREEDS OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe population of the world is religiously distributed very nearly in the\r\nfollowing proportions:\r\n\r\n  Christians                   388,600,000\r\n  Buddhists                    360,000,000\r\n  Other Asiatic religions      260,000,000\r\n  Pagans                       200,000,000\r\n  Mohammedans                  165,000,000\r\n  Jews                           7,000,000\r\n\r\nIn Europe, America, Australia, and many of the Polynesian Islands,\r\n_Christianity_ is the prevailing creed of every State. In Africa the\r\nonly independent Christian States are Abyssinia and Liberia, while\r\nChristianity prevails in several European colonies. The largest empire\r\nof Asia—Russia—is also a Christian country. India, the third country in\r\npoint of extent, is under the rule of a Christian government, and so is a\r\nlarge portion of Farther India.\r\n\r\nThe _Mohammedan_ countries in Asia are Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, and\r\nthe Khanates of Central Asia; in Africa—Morocco, the dependencies of\r\nTurkey (Egypt, Tunis, Tripoli) and a number of interior States.\r\n\r\n_Buddhism_ prevails in India, Farther India, in many parts of China, and\r\nin Japan. The governments of Burmah and Siam are Buddhist; the government\r\nof China adheres to the religion of Confucius; the religion of Japan is\r\n_Sintooism_.\r\n\r\n_Judaism_ is represented throughout the civilized world. The _Handbuch\r\nder Vergleichenden Statistik_ of G. Von Kolb (Leipzig, 1868) gives the\r\nfollowing as the number of Jews in the countries named: Germany, 478,500;\r\nAustria, 1,124,000; Great Britain, 40,000; France, 80,000; European\r\nRussia, 2,277,000; Italy, 20,200; Switzerland, 4,200; Belgium 1,500;\r\nNetherlands, 64,000; Luxemburg, 1,500; Denmark, 4,200; Sweden, 1,000;\r\nGreece, 500; European Turkey, 70,000.
